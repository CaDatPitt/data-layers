Alejandro Molina Lara is liv-
ing in exile from El Salvador.
As a trade union leader in that
country for 10 years he was
imprisoned four times and tor-
tured. He is a spokeman for
FENASTRAS, the National
Federation of Unions in El Sal-
vador, and he is currently tra-
veling in the United States
seeking support for the resist-
ance movement. What follows
is an account of the situation in
that country as seen through the
eyes of a revolutionary.

Pitt News: What is happen-
ing to El Salvador?

Lara: In El Salvador there is a
class struggle which has been
radicalized due to the fact a dic-
tatorship has been in power a
long time, massacring and
exploiting the people. It so
happens that fourteen families
are exploiting a country of five
million inhabitants, and these
fourteen families maintain
their situation through a mil-
itary dictatorship which is
backed by the United States
government. _

Pitt News: The American
government has made con-
tinued aid to El Salvador con-
tingent upon an improved
human rights situation there._ls
the human rights situation in
El Salvador improving?

Lara: It is true that Reagan
has been able to get Congress to
approve further military and

economic aid to the govern-
ment of El Salvador, but impor-
tant political forces in the
United States have been able to
force Reagan to certify again in
January that human rights con-
ditions have actually improved.
It will be totally impossible to
show that these things are actu-
ally being accomplished.

Pitt News: Were last spring’s
elections fair?

‘America should

send dollars to build
schools, to build hos-
pitals, to build indus-

tries, instead of arms.’

Lara: There was a systematic
pressure exerted upon the Sal-
vadorean people to go and vote
on the twenty-eighth of March.
Through all the media the
government was able to
threaten people and obligate
them to go and vote. Whoever
didn’t vote would be considered
against the “democratic"

government! .
Pitt News: What would
happen ‘to the people who

didn’t vote?

,,_El Salvador Exile Speaks Out

Lara: The consequences of
not voting—first of all, it was
known who voted and who
didn’t because there was a mark
that was put on your thumb-
and the consequences would be
repression. People were hauled
out of their houses and they
would be found thrown out on
the streets or on the roads,
decapitated, or with other
deformities.

Pitt News: What is the nature
of the resistance?

Lara: The insurgents consti-
tute one united group. The
FMLN is the military arm that
covers all the revolutionary for-
ces in El Salvador.

Pitt News: What are their
chances of success?

Lara: We feel that as long as
Reagan is helping militarily
and economically the govern-
ment of El Salvador we will be
unable to win the war, but
neither will we lose the war.
This would just prolong the
war and increase the suffering
of the people, because it is the
people that are being
massacred.

Pitt News: It has been
claimed by the Reagan admin-
istration that the resistance
movement in El Salvador is
being supplied by Cuba and
Nicaragua. Is this true?

Lara: Our forces receive pro-
visions from the very people of
El Salvador. We receive arma-
ments from the enemy that fall

“Such decisions as this are
regretable but necessary if we are to
carry out our duty to preserve and
protect the overall quality of the
university’s programs,” Posvar
said in a prepared statement.

Geography department faculty
and students, though not surprised

by the decision to close the depart— .

ment, believe their situation illus-
trates the way Pitt will deal with
dwindling finances in the future.
Some department memberssaid
geography is the first of several
programs that the University will
cut to meet financial demands.
“If were considered weak and
expendable, we are only the first in
a long series of savings to the uni-
versity by elimination rather than
constrained fiscal management,”
graduate student Vince Gutowski
said earlier this week.
Chancellor Wesley Posvar
announced Wednesday that he

would support Provost Rhoten

Smith’s recommendation to close
the department.

By MARK A. SINDLER

After a flurry of incidents involv-
ing students throwing various
objects from windows into the
Quad area, the Housing Office
recently passed a ruling on open-
window restrictions.

According to Jay Nalli, presi-
dent of the Resident Student Asso-
ciation, windows in buildings in
the Quad will only be permitted to
be opened eight inches on both the
bottom and top.

Donovan Hughes, director of
housing, did not return calls made
by The Pitt News yesterday and
could not be reached for comment.

Lt. James Watters, a campus
policeman, said there have been
injuries resulting from falling
objects, including a girl who had
her wrist broken by a falling glass
in September or October.

Watters said, “There have been
cars hit with eggs, and incidents
have occurred off and on at
Lothrop, where cars have been
seriously damaged by large bags of
water. I’d estimate there’s about
two incidents a week.”

Nalli agrees that only a few are
responsible for everyone’s suffer-
ing as a result of the housing
ruling.

“(The ruling) gives a bad name
for everyone,” he said. “There are a
select few hurting everyone else.”

Nalli said the ruling came about
due to the slow processing of cases
by Judicial Board. There is a
greater need for follow up on

penalties and punishments, he
said.
“Right now, (the Judicial

Board) is weak,” Nalli said. “They
take a lot of time on appeals, some-
times a month or eight weeks, and
yet the people are still there.”
Nalli estimates the offenders
only constitute about 1 percent of
the 4,200 people in the residence
halls. He has even heard rumors of
lawsuits filed by victimized

» students.

Smith recommended closing the
department in a Nov. 10 memo, cit-
ing few faculty, poor research qual-
ity, lack of “centrality" to the
university and an estimated annual
savings of .15] 66,000 through its
closing.

“I’m very unhappy about this,”
said geography professor William
Smole. “After all this time, it’s
finally over. But the repercussions
will be felt in the years to come.”

Quad Windows Locked

Nalli is not pleased in the least
with housing’s latest ruling.

“It’s another decision without
student input on the administra-
tion’s part,” he said. ‘‘I think it’s a
problem, but the majority is being
affected by a minority.”

By restricting the windows’
movement, students in the build-
ings affected will have to deal with
very warm rooms in the summer,
Nalli said. Lothrop is not included
in the ruling, and the Towers,
whose windows do not open at all,
are air conditioned. ‘

into our hands in the moun-
tains. There is no other way to
get arms to our people.

Pitt News: So then it is untrue
that the guerillas receive out-
side aid?

Lara: In such a small terri-
tory, between the air force and
helicopters that the US has pro-
vided, and the Navy on the
coastline, there is no way to get
arms in. The aid that the guer-

-(fﬁrilas do receive‘ is material aid

Kr

in terms of provisions and eco-
nomic aid, and mostly moral
support from governments that
are democratic and have a pro-
gressive policy.

P_itt News: Specifically?

Lara: Socialist or democratic
governments in Latin America,
not those that have military
regimes.

Pitt News: To your knowl-
edge, what is the purpose of US
involvement in El Salvador?

Lara: The United States
government is telling the Gua-
temalan government to get
ready, and next week they are
going to tell the Costa Rican
government to get the military
force ready too. The mission of
these armies is to try to destroy
our fighting forces.

Pitt News: So you expect an
in'vasion?

Lara: Yes, they are expecting
an invasion.

Pitt News: With these new
forces entering the conflict, do
you see a threat of the conflict
expanding?

Lara: It would have to spread
through the region because the
situation of the revolutionary
government of Nicargua is also
at stake. The U.S. objective is to

Pitt News: Do you see a uni-
fied front between the resistance
forces in El Salvador, Guatama-
la and ther government of
Nicaragua?

Lara: If they accomplish the
regionalization of the conflict
then the progressive forces in
the region would have to unify
their strategy in combat. They
would have to work together.

Pitt News: Is the average El
Salvadorean better off today
than he or she was a year ago?

mized the repression.

one who controls the army.

that the person most responsi-
ble for the deaths of Archbishop
Romero and the two American
labor leaders was d’Abuison.
Pitt News: Is thejudicial sys-
tem in El Salvador fair? Is it
independent of the
government? E
Lara: The judicial system has
always been an instrument of
the oligarchy. They have de-
stroyed unions and imprisoned
their leaders. S
Pitt News: What is the rela-
tionship of the government to
trade unions?
Lara: There are two types of
unions, those who follow the
government, and those who are
affiliated with the FDR (Demo-
cratic Revolutionary Front).
Unions that are affiliated with
the FDR are the most strategic
in the country, they are the ones
who move the economy, or stop
it when they want to. The FDR
is the political force of our
struggle against the govern-
ment. The FMLN is the mil-

itary political front of the
guerrillas.
Pitt News: What is your

vision of social justice for El
Salvador?

Lara: Whoever has the
money, who puts the money to
work, whoever invests the
money, and whoever does the
work to make that capital grow
should be rewarded, should get
a return based on the needs of
the person so as to lead a digni-
fied life.

Pitt News: What do you think
U.S. policy should be toward El
Salvador? —

Lara: American policy
should be based on friendship.
America should send dollars to
build schools, to build hospi-
tals, to build industries, instead
of arms. There are no schools,
no hospitals, no healthy clinics.
Unemployment is 60 percent.
Peasants don’t even have a place
to build their huts.

Pitt News: What will happen
to the oligarchy if the revolu-
tion is victorious?

Lara: They will do the same
thing that they did in October

—Page 3

1979. In 1979 there was an
attempt at reform and a lot of
them got scared and went to
Miami, fearing what might
happen. The oligarchy would
probably flee to Miami again.
Those who have massacred the
people, those who have exploit-
ed them would be judged for
what they have done.

Pitt News: And what would
happen to them?

Lara: Only the people can
decide.

Geography Closed

continued from page one

The closing, effective Fall 1983,
will affect 22 undergraduate
majors, L12 graduate students and
five faculty members. Three of the
five faculty. who are in the tenure
stream, will be reassigned to other

departments.

The decision to close the depart-
ment ends speculation about its
future that began in 1977, when
Faculty of Arts and Sciences dean
Jerome Rosenberg first discussed
its closing.

Several faculty committees
advised against such a move, but in
May of 1982, Rosenberg decided to
go ahead with a Planning
Resource Management ‘Systems

Proposal process closing the
department.

A special senate committee ana-
lyzed that PRMS proposal along
with the recommendations of four
faculty committees to continue the
department and rejected the pro-
posal in October.

Despite the administration’s
decision to overrule the faculty
committee's findings, Senate
Budget and Policies committee
chairman Wilfred Daehnick said
he believes the administration did
consider faculty opinion.

“I have the feeling that the
administration listened very care-
fully,” Daehnick said. “It certainly
weighed them seriously. That’s
why it took so long for them to
make a decision.”

Opinion

Facing  
- Cutbacks

Things are tough all over.
The university’s budget is shrinking, and Pitt

~ administrators are seeking new ways to make ends

meet. This week, three cost-cutting measures were
brought to the public’s attention: the closing (now
certain) of the geography department, the elimina-
tion of as many as 50 faculty positions in the Faculty
of Arts and Sciences over the next five years and
plans for the elimination of the new careers educa-
tional program of the University-Community Edu-
cational Programs.

This program, which is funded in part by the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences, offers day classes to
older students who take time off from jobs at various
social agencies to work towards bachelor’s degrees.

The three proposals share one unfortunate char-

acteristic: each action would directly affect students
by reducing available course offerings, increasing
class sizes and. in the case of the new careers pro-
gram, eliminating tuition assistance for partic-
ipating students. With these actions, Pitt adminis-
trators have made it quite clear that, as we enter the
age of “retrenchment” of universities, those,pro-
grams which directly benefit students will be the first
‘to go.

There is no doubting that the economic circum-
stances facing Pitt make it necessary to reduce spend- a
ing. But in confronting these financial restrictions,
we need not, and should not, focus only on student
programs.

Instead,‘ Pitt’s administrators must turn their
attention first upon themselves. While no university
can operate without professional administration,
few would deny that Pitt’s vast bureaucracy could
stand a stricter diet. Any measure which would
streamline this bureaucracy—cutting costs without
cutting student programs—-would be, by any mea-
sure, more cost-effective than measures which
simply eliminate programs. Granted, these meas-
ures may not be enough to balance spending and
revenue, but they must be undertaken before we
begin to eliminate services.

While meeting declining budgets, our aim must
be the efficient provision of as many services as pos-
sible. If a university’s most fundamental responsibil-
ity is not to educate, then what might it be? i

Liberal Arts...Again

By RON BARBER

You'll have to count me among
the apologists for education in the
liberal arts. I think there’s a lot to
be said for studying the broad
range of subjects considered part of
a liberal education. But I wouldn’t
feel right saying that liberal arts
majors are better than anybody
else. I am lucky that in my chosen
field—the law—a liberal education
is often an advantage. So Iconsider

that I have been afforded the luxury _

of four years’ study in fields that,
concededly, have little “market
value.”

Let's notkid ourselves about the
marketability of the liberal arts.
You can’t tell someone that he can
study philosophy or history for
four years and become a hot item
on thejob market. It’sjust not true.

But I think that a liberal educa-

tion has benefits of its own. I have '
. long felt that, parallel to techno-

logical advances that afford us a
more comfortable and healthy life,
continued study in the liberal arts
is necessary to maintain the ethical
and social qualities of life. That is,
society only progresses when both

technology and social relations are _

improved.

And let’s not be too hard on those
computer science majors, either.
Face it, folks, computers are mak-

‘I am afraid that those who
lament each latest inroad

made by the computer will

be doing a lot of lamenting -

for a long timeto come.
They might do better to
learn how to talk to those

“green-eyed beasts.” ’

ing our lives easier; they do, and
will undoubtedly continue to,
allow us to do a lot more a lot bet-
ter. Anything that can do this for us

deserves praise, and people who
want to further the development
and applications of computers
deserve all the encouragement we
can give. I am afraid that those who
lament each latest inroad made by
the computer into our everyday

. lives will be doing a lot of lament-

ing for a long time to come. They

might do better to learn how to 

to those “green-eyed beasts.” Re-
sisting progress has seldom been
successful.

/

Something still worries me,
however. I am concerned that fewer’
and fewer students are interested in
studying the liberal, arts and scien-
ces, even on an occasional basis. It
seems that there are precious few
reasons apparent to today’s student
to delve into these subjects.

Now, I would not force a liberal
arts education on anyone. I think
the value of liberal studies is dim-
inished by compulsion. But have
economic incentives so favored
technological fields that no ,
wants to study philosophy any?
more? Can civilization afford that?

Assistant Opinions Editor.)

Celebrating In Bad Taste

Dear Editor:

I am writing in regard to this
year’s Student Government Board
elections and results.

Although a majority of the can-
didates who ran are part of the
Greek System here at Pitt, the elec-
tion should not be a means of com-
petition among fellow Greeks.
Don't get me wrong, I am not try-
ing to vent anti-Greek sentiments
because I too am active in the Greek
system, and I should point out that
initially I was very proud of the fact
that so many fellow Greeks chose

ble people willing to push aside
their own personal beliefs in order
to reach decisions that will benefit
the entire student body? As a fourth
year student involved with the stu-
dent government at different times,
the second

I have to opt for
definition.

didates on Fifth Avenue the night
of the election. To make this
clearer, my sleep was rudely inter-
rupted by this group of people who
thought the situation lent itself to
composing songs about those
unsuccessful candidates.

I, myself, do.not wish to slander
these candidates by directly point-
ing a finger at them because I can’t
honestly say I saw them personally
involved in this group action. But,
I am only human and, like others,

The

Pitt News, Friday November 19, 1982

By DANA REED

In the past few issues of The

_@Pitt News, and rightly so, there

has been a major emphasis
placed on Provost Rhoten
Smith’s decision to terminate
the geography department.

While I sympathize and sup-
port the efforts of those who are
trying to prevent its closing,
might I say that “the writing
has been on the wall.” Many
have known that the future of
that department was doomed
for some time.

Perhaps one can say that the
tate of the geography depart-
ment was determined when
Posvar decided to close the Uni-

’met not a whimper o‘f .-opposi-
tion. This test case, in effect, set
a precedent and gave the green
light for termination of the geo-
graphy department.

i Many may ' claim that this
relationship is just coinciden-
tal, maybe even a conspiracy
theory on my part. But let’s face
the facts. Given the national
trend of cutbacks and elimina-
tions, it would only be approp-
r'iate for Posvar and Smith to get
in on swinging the ax.

The severity of the economic
crises, coupled with declining
revenues and lower state appro-
priations, has made Pitt’s
y administration realize that
some excess baggage has to go.

The paring will always begin
with the weakest link. Using

“trumped up” charges and slick

 

versity Women"s =Center and

 

 

United Way...
_thanks to you
It works

for all of us!

“ financial reports prepared by
the best accounting firms, Pos-
var and his administrators, with
the Board of Trustees’ bless-
ings, have gone on the
offensive.

It's been common knowledge
for the past few years that the
geography department has been
on the chopping block.

One would have to be naive
to think that Smith and Posvar
would begin to cut in their own
backyard andget rid of some of
the excess cargo in the adminis-
trative budget. “Fat cat”
bureaucrats like Smith would
never think of depriving “ole
Wes” from dining on lobster
Newburg at the Faculty Club,
let alone taking away his chauf-
fered l_imosine.

Pitt students, faculty and
employees: let’s face facts. The
ship is sinking and the load has
to be lightened. With the
Women’s Center and geo-
graphy department down the
drain, who will be next? Could
it possibly be the Women’s Stu-
dies or Black Studies programs?
No one really knows for sure,
but some poor soul will be on
the receiving end of the Posvar-
Smith offensive.

My only hope is that we all
can unite in the scramble for the
remaining crumbs and
smaller piece of the pie. Let’s
make sure everyone bears an
equal share of the sacrifice.

department. If someone wants to
read only the good news about the
Panther football team, I suggest
they subscribe to “Golden Panther
Prints."

Dear Editor:

As the sports editor of The Pitt
News during the 1976-77 school
year and the associate sports editor
and writer before that, I would like
to comment on a recent exchange
of letters between current sports

editor Barry Zasloff and a reader A5 Someonewho We“ remembﬂs

the days Pitt was winning one'foot-
ball game per year instead of losing
one, I would be the first to say the
Panthers deserve much praise
when it is warranted. But they still
should be criticized when that is
warranted as well——just like any-
thing else. That is the job of The
Pitt News sports department and
unfortunately many fans lose sight
of that fact.

One of my main rules in running
the department was No Cheerlead-
ing. That’s what the Sports Infor-
mation Office is paid to do. That’s
not to say opinions of praise and
criticism cannot be put into a
column. But they do not belong in

‘a news account unless backed by
facts. That is, if Dan Marino
throws four interceptions, he mer-
its criticism. It is not thejob of The
Pitt News to make alibis for
anyone.

While on the subject of the sports
department, which I feel does a
very good job, may I suggest more
coverage of the minor (that is, non-
revenue) sports. We used to cover
water polo, hockey, bowling, etc.,
sports that may not have a large
following at Pitt, but are there
nonetheless. Even a brief story in a
roundup once in a while would be

‘nice. The Pitt sports scene is a lot
more than just football and basket-
ball.

I think some of the readers of
The Pitt News are confusing it
with Bob Prince and even the cur-
rent Pirate announcers, who are
hired by KDKA, but approved by
the ball club. The frequent use of
“‘we” and “us” and"‘our” through-
out the broadcasts are totally
unprofessional. And I give credit to
Mr. Zasloff for not falling into that
rut at The Pitt News, which is sup-
posed to be the student newspaper,
independent of any school organi-

Once while I was sports editor, I
ran an article on the arrest of Larry .
Harris, Pitt’s star basketball player,
for allegedly punching a resident
assistant in :1 Tower B elevator.
The facts were on record at the
campus police station. Yet a lot of
people felt it should not have been

By PAUL HOUGHTON

Aristophanes wrote Lysistratmthe
current University of Pittsburgh

heatre production, during the fifth

ntury B.C. in the city-state of
Athens, which was, as usual, at
sword’s point with the other Greek
city-states. Athens’ arch-enemy was
brutal, totalitarian, though stran-
gely heroic, Sparta, where a figure
like Aristophanes could never have
arisen; he would have been rapidly
disposed of if he had. The Athens-
Sparta rivalry in particular and the
Greek passion for internecine war
and vendetta in general was always
-the major threat to the survival of
the magnificent Greek civilization,

~,Q,-and . Greece finally did commit

national suicide in this absurd and
tragic manner. Aristophanes wrote
Lysistrata as a protest against this state
of affairs, wrote it in bitterness and
savagely mocking despair. This play
was the B.C. version of an absurdist
comedy, the literary equivalentof
throwing one’s hands up in disgust
and bewilderment. -

The Athens of Aristophanes’ time
was an overwhelmingly male-
dominated society, and Aristophanes
‘shared the values of that society.
Therefore, he could think of no bet-

-» ger way to illustrate his sense of des-

pairing urgency and his utter
contempt for the mindless, self-
destructive posture of the leaders
and citizens of the Attic patriarchate
than by writing a play in which the
women of Athens, who generally
3,received little more respect than con-

cubines or courtesans, show the men
up as absolute fools.

Lysistrata deals with a female sex-
strike, organized by the heroine of
the title. Appalled by the death-wish
of the war-like men, imagining
themselves widows and their child-

(fen fatherless, the women of Athens,

through wit, cunning and courage,

under the leadership of Lysistrata,
occupy the acropolis, where they
vow to remain, denying their men
the joys of sex until the men agree to
sue for peace. The play moves from
that point to a happy conclusion, but
not until the men of Athens are fully
revealed as ignoramuses who cannot
respond to rational argument, only

‘ to the dictates of their glands. This

play greatly offended the vanity of
the Athenian elite who pictured
themselves as superior beings in
rational control of their lives and of
their more basic instincts.

The problem with this production
is its under"-cutting of Aristopo-

See-Throagh Production Bypasses Tlze Play

hanes’ message, its complete de-
emphasis of the serious in favor of
the farcical. Sleazy soft-core double-
entendre dominates this production
as completely as it does a Tonight Show
skit, and while the sexual farce is
certainly a major element of the play
and should be maintained as such,
the guiding vision behind-a produc-
tion will determine whether it is
there to support a wider representa-
tion of human folly or simply for its
own sake, diluting the governing
idea of the play, blunting all serious
thought, subverting ethical concern
and arousing guffaws from an
audience that is being condescended

to. The serious anti-war outcry of
this play is lost in farce, innuendo
and a shallow interpretation of femi-
nism and sexual politics that ha
nothing to do with Aristophanes.

There are '21 flock of my EHlElE§,
scantily clad, in this production, and
that is a visual plus. Patricia Hicok is
a beautiful, provacative virago, and
gives as much dignity to her role as
the production will permit. But the
Broadway-style tunes and lyrics
stuck into this play are intrusive, and
the over‘-emphasis on frustrated men
in Greek dress with grotesque, stim-
ulated erections is a joke that wears.

THE THREE STOOGES
SCRAPBOOK

By Jeff Lenburg, Joan Howard
Maurer and Gregg Lenburg

Citadel Press, 288 pages

Concerning the Three Stooges,
”audiences were divided roughly into
two groups: one made up of persons
who laughed at them and the other of
those who wondered why." At any
rate, according to The Three Stooges
Scrapbook, the team is enjoying a popu-
larity surge now, which necessitates
such a scrapbook.

This generously illustrated volume
is the result of meticulous and pre-
sumably accurate research. It con-
sists of biographies of each Stooge
(there were six altogether: Moe
Howard and Larry Fine appeared var-
iously with Curly Howard, Shemp
Howard, Joe Besserg or Ioe DeRita)

SHADOWLAND
By William Arnold
Berkley Paperbacks

Nobody remembers anymore. But
there was a girl who grew up in Seat-
tle and got into the movies in 1936
and was a success. Twenty—one she
was, and they compared her to Kath-
arine Hepburn and Greta Garbo. Her
name was Frances Farmer, and she
was Cinderella—screen test at 20 and
overnight stardom. Critics were
ecstatic.

But she was a controversial figure.
Thszs were mmmts of communist

_ sympathies. She was outspoken; she

valued her privacy and appeared
rebellious to the Hollywood
community.

In 1943, in the aftermath of a
drunken driving charge and personal
problems, she was hospitalized
briefly for ”mental unbalance." And
then she wanted to quit acting, being

and a brief overview of their history-

as a team, but much of the book con-
cerns itself with related areas—
merchandise featuring the Stooges
(comic books, TV cartoon, record
albums, promotional items), descrip-
tions of their television appearances,
their imitators and the current cult.
There's an incredibly complete filmo-
graphy as a sort of appendix, listing
synopses of their short films, fea-
tures and guest shots—well over 300
listings. Virtually everything you
always wanted to know....

Visual slapstick humor—the
Stooges’ forte—does not transfer
well to paper. If you haven't seen
much of their work, the descriptions
of their routines provide no insight
into their comedy. Other routines are
alluded to-—the ”hospital operation"
skit or the ”Niagara Falls" sketch-
with no _explanatory information

uncomfortable in the public spo-
tlight. Unthinkable. Her mother
signed commitment papers for the
Western Washington State-Hospital
in early 1944. The doctors examined
her; Frances Farmer was declared
insane. Perhaps she was willful and
troubled, but why was this intelli-
gent, high—strung woman committed
to a mental hospital? She was paroled
after three months and inexplicably
re—admitted in 1945. She protested
and ‘was thrown into the violent
ward and’ did not get out for five
years.

It was a descent into unimaginable
terror. The ward was overcrowded
and unsanitary. She was raped and

‘sexually degraded literally hundreds

of times by the hospital orderlies
(trustees from the state prison). Doc-
tors used her to test numerous psy-
chiatric drugs and treatments, and
she was frequently electric-shocked

except that they were considered
”hilarious" or ”hysterical."

The book, written by brothers Jeff
and Gregg Lenburg, who knew most
of the Stooges, and by Joan Maurer,
Moe Howard's daughter, is affection-
ately biased. It doesn't show why or if
the Three Stooges were funny, but it
is persuasive. Sometimes, the senti-

:

into insensibility for uncooperative
behavior. She remained rebellious.
Although it cannot be proven, strong

' evidence indicates that she was lobo-

tomized in late 1948. .

A different, docile Frances Farmer
was released from the hospital in
1950. She wandered, disappeared
and resurfaced in the late '50s, find-
ing work in radio, stage and televi-
sion. Her "comeback" was
impermanent due to increased drink-
ing and understandable memory
problems. She was able to earn

book avoids the lurid tell—all trap-

It's doubtful that the facts sur-
rounding Frances Farmer's tragedy
will ever be satisfactorily explained,
but Arnold has assembled a sympa-
thetic, appalling chronicle. Says
Arnold, ”She was quite simply-—and
in the very truest sense of the word——
a martyr."

TERRORISTS & NOVELISTS
By Diane Johnson
Knopf

In her first collection of essays,
Diane Johnson has achieved a diffi-
cult and tempermental form. Her
writing is clear and concise, her topics
are, at one time or another, of inter-
st to the general public, and gener-
ally, they cover issues and points of
view never before conceived or
covered quite so well. But for all this
emotional and intellectually heady
stuff, Terrorists ér Novelists falls some-
what short of the mark. Johnson has
fallen into the same trap as so many
personal essayists of late; the essays,
when presented alone or with essays
by others, are often more readable
than when they're bunched together
in a collection.

In the preface, Johnson tells the
reader that, for the most part, the
pieces in this collection were topics
suggested by the editors of both the
New York Review of Books and the New
York Times Book Review, and that she
really doesn't like to seek out pieces to
criticize. Perhaps that explains the
lack of humor and the genuine

insight that is needed to make a col-

lection to work. Serious and scholarly
topic after serious and scholarly topic
tends to drag one down a bit. In read-
ing this, you might find yourself
longing for the simpler times of E.B.
White.

But the collection is an excellent
study of the personal essay form,
which represents the onlytrue form
of autobiography. In this, Johnson
has more or less succeeded. The
reader derives a sense of what is and
isn't important to Johnson by the
force and dexterity of her writing.

But whilethe essays may lose their
individuality in a collection-more

' charm and interest is to be found in

their original book review setting-
the work is nonetheless a good one,
though not terribly practical. After
all, if one has no specific interest in
the topics discussed, why buy it? It's
not like the works of Nora Ephron or
E.B. White, in which the act of read-
ing the essay is itself a useful and
insightful view into our society.
These pieces are an insightful and
useful view into Diane Johnson. And
that is all.

wastes an inordinate number of
pages re—telling Stones fans (assum-
ing they're the only ones interested in
buying the book) the story of How

already know from numerous other
books written about the band.

Aftel claims to have spent several
years writing Death of a Rolling Stone,
interviewing everyone who came in
contact with Jones, but there are no

Death of a Rolling Stone might be
interesting to someone who's just
discovered Brian Jones and/or the
Stones, but not anyone else. It seems
more like a pathetic attempt to cash in
on adolescents’ craze for mythic read-
ing material about deceased rock
stars.

SOCIAL STUDIES
By Fran Lebowitz
Pocket Books

Social Studies is a book comprised of
amusing anecdotes and humorous
witticisms. L_ebowitz writes with dry
wit, and throughout the book taunts
the reader with what could be
construed as vicious satire. Her point
of view is mainly that of a socialite
snob, but the work is presented in
such a droll manner that it comes
across as being entertaining rather
than insulting.

Many of the topics covered in Social
Studies are rather paradoxical in
nature, to the point of seeming trite
and senseless. A few of the topics are
comical, but for the most part the

reader is subjected to one of the

worst fates in life——‘unfunny humor.
The majority of the material in Social
Studies does have the capability of
being humorous if it were presented
in the right environment——perhaps in
the spontaneity of a cocktail party
where most of the guests are in a
semi-inebriated condition.

Fortunately'for Lebowitz, some of
her themes are original enough to
invoke a small chuckle from the
reader, especially in her "Tips for
Teens" chapter where she advises the
teen to "try to derive some comfort
from the knowledge that if your gui-
dance counselor were working up to
his potential, he wouldn't still be in
high school" and "stand firm in your
refusal to remain conscious during
algebra. In real life, I assure you,
there is no such thing as algebra."

On the whole, this paperback (the
hardback was published last year), is
not worth the $3.25 selling price. If,
perhaps, you come across a discarded
copy by accident, it might be worth
thumbing through just to. pass the
time.‘ However, if you're Catholic,
don't read the chapter entitled "At
Home With Pope Ron," and if you're
easily bored, don't read the chapter
on "the Frances Ann Lebowitz Col-
lection." It could be fatal.

DEATH OF A ROLLING STONE
By Mandy Aftel
Delilah Books

Everybody remembers the deaths
of Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, and Jim
Morrison, but few remember the
death of the original Rolling Stone.
Brian Jones died at the age of 27 (the
same age, I might add, as Joplin and
Hendrix) on July 3, 1969. The official
autopsy report concluded death by
drowning, but numerous drug sub-
stances and alcohol were also found
in his body. Sounds reasonable——
another wild rock star pumping him-
self full of pills and booze. But, still,
something didn't sound right; testi-
mony from Jones’ employees as to the
position of the body and the events
leading up to its discovery were in
conflict. Rumors abounded: was
Jones, a controversial figure who was
constantly harassed by police, mur-
dered? Was he killed beforehand,
then his body put in his swimming
pool to make it look like an accident?
Did he commit suicide one month
after leaving (or was he fired?) the
Rolling Stones? No one seemed to

former Python‘ Michael Palin has
written and stars in the story ofCha—

It seems that the Bishop of London
is being pressured by his earthly
superiors to do something about the
problem of that city's prostitutes. His
solution is to charge Fortescue with
building a mission within the city:
”Go among prostitutes, Fortescue.
Find out why they do what they
do...and stop them from doing it."

However, not only does Fortescue
have to run the mission, he has to
find the support for it, a far from
simple task, given the purpose for
which the funding is to be used.

Apparently, most Englishmen of

Fortescue is contacted by Lady Ames,

the most ordinary type. Four of the
stories repeat the same plot: the
downtrodden get revenge in horrific
ways on evil people. All five-stories
start with a simple premise that can
only lead in one direction (and does).
For example, the second vignette
shows Stephen Kingfas a country
yokel who turns into a plant after
contact with a meteor and its strange
fumes. That's all there is—no devel-
opment except the working out of a
fundamental situation with no sur-

Touching
All The

Bases

By JILL SAVITZ

For some, this year's jazz seminar,
which took place Nov. 4, 5 and 6,
meant the coming together of some
of jazz's most respected artists. For
saxophonist Grover Washington, }r.,
it meant the chance to learn just as
much as the students who attended
the different sessions.

"Any time you stress the basics and
tell your ideas, chances are that 10
times out of 10, you get feedback that
will help you make better music,"
Washingtoin said. "If you learn, you
should share."

Washington also said playing at
Pitt's jazz seminar was unique
because "It's rare that a school this
size and of the importance that Pitt is
has a music department this
extensive.”

g Nathan Davis, director of jazz stu-
dies, was also an encouragement for
Washington to come. "I've been a fan
of Nathan Davis’ for 20 years. He
lives what I've been trying to get
together," he said. Anyone who

attended Saturday night's concert
that the

could see respect was

' musical

mutual.

Normally, Washington spends
most of his time in the recording stu-
dio. "I like the studio best because I'm
learning to be a better producer with
every album. I'm learning a lot about
the technical parts of studio work
that you have to know to give people
direction on what you want," he said.

Besides his saxophone playing and
his involvement in producing, both
for himself and an up-and-coming
group who recently played at Pitt
called Pieces Of A Dream, Washing—
ton has been pursuing a Ph. D. in
composition at Temple
University.

Playing songs with and without
vocals gives Washington's music

more variety than that of other jazz
artists. "I think of vocalists as musi-
cians because they're so musical.
They have more than one way of
relating their talent," he said.

"Singers and musicians, actors and
narrators. I try to be an interpreter. I
try to sing through my horn, to let
the audience know what I'm thinking
about. Certain tunes don't need
words; they need feelings," he
further explained.

Washington's music, like most jazz,
is often improvised with only the
melodies and the bridges repeated a
certain number of times. He said that
his music is inspired by his wife, his
family and "the kind of feeling I get
when somebody asks a question I can

answer, like in the seminar session."

Washington seems to know where
he's headed musically. He wants to
produce and branch out into film
scores. But this wasn't always the
case.

"When I first started, I tried. to let
everyone know I could play. Now, I'm
more interested in good music. Good
music can be commercial, it can be
jazz or bebop or classical. It's all in the
care that you take with the tune...."
he said.

THE PSYCHEDELIC FURS
Heaven
NOV. 4, 1982
By SCOTT MERVIS

When all is sung and done, there's
really not much that can be said about
the Psychedelic Furs. They're honest

attack, yet they're not spectacular
enough to be raised on a pedestal and
lavished. The Furs are simply a good,
solid pop band. To the Heaven crowd,
they were less an ”event" than an
interesting interlude between the
long-playing versions of dance mixes
by Bananarama and Billy Idol. The
only observable change in the
audience's attitude was a physical
movement into one stream of people,
which is now a poplar form of
Pittsburgh pseudo-slam dancing. In
other words (and I'm sure you would
prefer them), The Furs, in their
lyrical and musical ambiguity,
present little to challenge the
audience with. Unlike recent
Pittsburgh concerts (and
unfortunately, the comparisons are
unavoidable), The Furs did not
arouse in the crowd an anger at a
band's pretensions (The Clash), or a
violent emotional reaction from the
intensity of the stimulus (Gang of
Four).

What The Furs did do was manifest
their political—r»omantic message in
the prose of frontman Richard
Butler. Chain-smoking with one
ihand, while the other stroked his

and talented enough to escape critical J

psychedelic furs

gracefully prowled the stage in a
Bowie-like manner. His raspy,
nicotine voice, to my amazement,
was a perfect reproduction of the
recorded material (or is that the other
way around.7). Anyway, The Furs
produced a web of sound thickly
textured by a barrage of dreamy
guitar (John Ashton), booming
drums (Vince Ely), saxophone (Gary
Window), an occasional thread of
cello (Ann Sheldon), and of course,
Butler's voice, which blends like
another instrument.

Through this maze, leaks Butler's
poetry of romantic and political
cynicism. Butler, who himself
projects the image of a bohemian
lifestyle, scoffs at the superficiality of
romance and its social and sexual
connections, while he knows that he
cannot escape from them. At the
height of ”Eall," he sings, "Marry me
and be my wife, you can have me all your
life/Our love will never end, parties for our
stupid friends/...I am you and you are me, tie
me down and we'll be free." In several of
the more recent (Forever Now) songs,
Butler's cynicism lands on the big
business of politics, and the futility of
the public's role in the process.
”Presid'ent Gas" asserts: "Open up
your eyes just to check if you're
asleep again."

The problem was that, although at
times, their musical builds were
awesome ("Imitation of Christ,"
"Sister of Europe," "Only You And I,"
and "India"), at certain points I had to

-Civic Arena

By TODD ERKEL

Billy Joel's concert last Thursday at
the Civic Arena was both ironic in its
failure to live up to its theme and
symptomatic. The two or three thou-
sand empty seats were glowing evi-
dence of just how badly the business
of ro .k-n-roll is hurting these days.

Nobody could have guessed that
those empty seats would be indicative

_ of the performance Joel delivered.
' The problems arose more from what

he did than from what he failed to do.

touches to accompany his storehouse
of great music, Joel chose instead to
pull out all the stops, and a valiant
attempt at creating an atmosphere in
a hockey arena got snuffed out in the
process. From there, the show had
the pacing of talent night at a road-
side cafe for the broken—hearted.

Pittsburgh, with all of its blue-
collar ghosts, would have been the
perfect place for Joel to play out the
show’s theme of "working." Such an
expression was begun, framed visu-
ally with a starkly effective stage
crossed with steel beams, twisting
black exhaust pipes and a working
factory whistle, and supported musi-
cally with a tape of Sam Cooke's
”Chain Gang," during which Joel and
the rest of his band strolled out onto
stage. The material off The Nylon Cur-
tain, especially the opener, "Allen—
town," reinforced the hard hat aura,
but most of what followed rang as
empty as the J&L works.

flowed smoothly, Joel showing no

the distractions began.

First, there was lead guitarist Dave
Brown, one of the most obnoxious
and boring figures ever to step out
onto a stage. Brown did everything
he could to get noticed; everything,
that is, except play the guitar. This
character played fashion plate all
night, modeling his designer rags in
sweeping bravado motions.

Then there came a series of hokey
props (does a song like "Scenes From
An Italian Restaurant" need a check-
ered table and a bottle of red, white,
etc.?) and the road crew review who
treated us to three guest appearan-
ces. Billy, wha?

Song selection and arrangement
had to result from that wonderful
game know as darts. The show’s mid-
section became bogged down in Joel's
52nd St. review and Joel's best ballads,
”Just The Way You Are" and "She's
Always a Woman," songs that make it
on MUZAK, sounded rushed and
uninspired. I'm still wondering why
he chose to bury ”Scenes From An
Italian Restaurant," a perennial clos-
ing number ala Springsteen's "Rosal-
ita,” with disposable crap like "Don't
Ask Me Why."

Gold stars for the audience, who
kept their senses and their applause
for something worthwhile—and
when it came, they reacted. Sure, the
fact that it was Veteran's Day had
something to do with it, but when
Joel did his epic tribute‘ to Vietnam,
"Goodnight Saigon," there thun-
dered an incredible and spontaneous
sigh of ”that's more like it" applause
that left chills.

Even during the raucous ending,
Joel seemed hesitant to walk out on
the edge, where we've always looked

to find him. He's just as charismatic

 

initial intrigue of seeing Butler and
his romantic gestures, The Furs were
not really forceful enough to power
through the duration of the show.
(To a female, of course, the intrigue
may have never worn off.) The
reason that they cannot maintain
their force may be because, although
The Furs are original and innovative,
diversity is not one of their strong
points. Their songs tend to gather
around similar vocal phrasing and
blending of melody, and they
sometimes cross the border into
undanceable territory. And, although

and charming as ever, but the deliv-
ery has been tempered. No more run-
ning from piano to piano; no more
manic attacks on the ivories.

Billy Joel has waged a few battles of
late, whether they be with critics, on
the homefront or out on the high-
way, and, although they may have
driven his songwriting to its greatest
heights, they've also drained the
man. That price has been paid by
artist and audience alike for many
years in many media—it's nothing
special, and neither was this concert.

GARY NUMAN
Nov. 5
Stanley Theatre

By STEVE HORWITZ

My mind raced to and fro across
the off-beat terrain of local talent—
the Cardboards—jerky tempos and
oddly-mixed rhythms distinguished
the band, keeping my interest for a
while. There were, however, a few
songs that proved too disjointed to be
classified as anything other than
worthless musicianship.

The crowd, a youthful group,
reacted quite ironically toward the
band; one person shouted obscenities
during the songs only to clap enthusi-
astically at the end of each number. In
time, the Cardboards ended their set
and left the stage as chants for
"Numan" began to drown out the
miscellaneous conversations of
friends. —

But it would be a while and th

to be replaced by pitch darkness. The

pale blue lights slowly intensified as

an ice vapor eerily clouded my view.
Not knowing for sure, I imagined the
outline of a human form deep within
the cloud obscura. The subtle drone
of synthesized notes brought me into
reality as Gary Numan and band
appeared from behind the frosty
mask.

Dressed in all-white '40s garb, the
mysterious sounds gave way to the
funk of"Music for Chameleons." The
crowd's initial clamour eventually
subsided as the song twisted through
its various moods. "We Take Mystery
to Bed" brought several fans to the
front only to be quickly whisked
away by security personnel.Follow-
ing, the band led us back to some ear-
lier material including "I'm an
Agent."

Throughout, Numan's presence on
stage dominated. Hiding behind a
stealthy, cool image aided by pale blue
lights and makeup, Numan appeared
a man out of time; something of a
villain in centuries to come.

Numan traversed the stage in
deliberate steps only occasionally
revealing his bond to humanity
through a smile of appreciation. In
time, the synthesized whine of
"Cars" filled the room while a rush of
people crowded the aisles. Echoes of
vocal accompaniment and crazed
dancing followed up until the end of
the show. "Cars" led into an excellent
version of "White Boys and Heroes"
which sent the crowd into a frenzy.

But like all good things, the band
eventually left the stage. And yet,
even in their absence, the spirit of the
crowd remained the same. Two
encores followed, keeping all dancing
and singing the whole way through.
From every angle the show was a suc-
cess. And from the expressions of the
band, they were as pleased with the
show as everyone else.

On Vinyl

LONG AFTER DARK
Tom Petty
MCA

Tom Petty had to answer to a
lot of ”What’s this stuff?” after
the releaseof Hard Promises, so
maybe he isn't at fault for put-
ting out a record like Long After
Dark, which abandons all of the
lighter textures and R&B
touches of his last album and
settles instead to crank out the
rockers, one after another, that
made everyone stand up and
notice Damn The Torpedoes.

‘Long After Dark certainly
assaults one more on the first
listen than Hard Promises did, but
I wonder whether it can survive
the test of time. Petty has never
really shown a flare for lyrical
expression, and this album con-
tinues his trend of ambiguous
boy-meets-girl conflicts. Petty’s

vocals, those sneering, phlegmy I

whines that make every word
sound angry, and every song
seem fatally urgent are once
again the key.

It's too bad that the first con-
tact the public will have with

I ADVANCE MASKED
Fripp/Summers
A & M

Robert Fripp has a new record
out and his (musical) son Andy
Summers is on it. The music
reflects math, structures, pat-
terns and cycles used to create
sound which is, believe it or not,
pleasantly bland. No, this record
does not push contemporary
music to its limits but it sounds
real keen on an expensive hi-fi.

The music is highly electronic
and synthesized, lowly percus-
sive and barely Summerized. If
they had not printed Andy
Summers’ name on the album
sleeve it would have been nearly
impossible to tell he was on -the
-record. This is so Frippy it may
lead one to think that Bob will
soon become the most domi-
nant and consequently stagnant
force in pop music to date.

- ‘The result, of this perverse

form of collaboration is nice, but
not very challenging, music.

1 ‘This album could be worth the _ a

 

this record might be the single,
”You Got Lucky.” The synthes-
ized hook on the song is a nice
experiment for Petty, but it's
not at all representative of the
rest of the material.

- Side one contains four
straightforward rockers that
harken back to ”Even The Los-
ers," ”I Need To Know," etc.
Safe to say that the often talked
about Byrds/Stones elements
have at last become Tom Petty’s
sound and nobody's else’s. It
becomes clear at this point that
the subtler melodies of Hard
Promises have been scrapped, at
least as far‘ as this project goes.

Side two fleshes out many of
the blues/rock' sounds one
would expect from what many
people forget is a Southern
(Gainesville) band. The guitars
here are heavily distorted and
reminiscent of power groups
BTO, ZZ Top and others.
”Straight Into Darkness” is one
of Petty's most complex and
haunting songs, its hypnotic
lead weaving in and out of Ben-
mont Tench's keyboard. Some
of the other songs here, like

ROCI<’S ROMANT15 IN A HOLDING 
PATTERN  

”Between Two Worlds,” sound
muddled, and Petty's attempts
at honky vocals are question-
able The only real flop of the
record, though, is a swaying lit-
tle tropical aria called ”A Wasted
Life," on which Petty’s sinewy
voice appears way out of place.

Petty seems to have satisfied
both the commercial demands
on his music with side one's
neatly packaged rockers and his

need to try out his new-found
artistic freedoms. Long After Dark
may not raise the questions that
Hard Promises did, but I doubt if it
will be noticed as much either.

taken.

Inproper: pay careful atten-
tion to the music when it is play-

the social, moral, musical, philo-
sophical, technical, and intellec-

ov‘~er—indul_gent, pseudo-

ger, Howard Dev‘oto, is an
afficionado of Dostoevsky), the

and stuffy, although a highly
individualistic and, more than
not, fascinating. A true cult

singles, both A and B sides.
Noteworthy are ”Give Me Ever-
ything” with its dynamic tonal
shifts, the Captain Beefheart
cover ”I Love You You Big

tomizes Magazine for me, their
cover of the James Bond theme,
”Goldfinger,” which caps off
what is a worthy purchase for
either the Magazine freak (who
probably has all the singles any-
way) or those who want to be
”in touch” with one of the
unknown/famous bands of the
late '70s. All in all, this is what's
called an ”intelligent compila-
tion" and I recommend it to both
novice and connoisseur alike.

"World Citizenship"/"Cry
Love”

The Core

Core Records

On their first recording
attempt, Pittsburgh's own, The
Core, have managed to capture
and enhance the magic of their
live performances. Almost like
the acrobatics of singer Tony
Miles, "World Citizenship"

opens with a graceful leap into
the midst of clicking guitars, tri-
bal percussion and an organ
and sax that twirl with ‘each
other through the heartbeat,
reggae rhythm. Miles’ vocals
have a soulful, Jamaican flavor
with a wide range of flexibility
in reach and emotion. His voice
glides from a forceful into an
affectionate tone in this song
that cries for us to begin to real-
ize the value of life and recog-
nize the nature of the world's
people as being ”one creation.”
Producer Marc Reisman’s chil-
ling sax creates a smoky night-
club atmosphere aroung the
daylight. images of lyrics like

”What we need is peace and love
to stay together...,” and what
results is a subtle touch of irony.
Spiritually anthemic and uplift-
ing, everything is working in
”World Citizenship.”

The flipside, ”Cry Love," is
fast andmanic and one of the
highlights of their live shows. A
furious flow of percussion sets
the pace, and the band franti-
cally chases it through the song.
One might imagine that San-
tana would sound like this if
they weren't catering to the
mainstream, especially in light
of the slick guitar prowess of
Kurt Resch. Miles slowly over-
takes the runaway rhythm and
gains control of the song with
vocals that are reminiscent of
the Motown R&B sound. Again,
the thrust of the song is the
message that people need love
everyday, and this message is
now unique in pop music, which
has become dominantly cen-
tered on the individual.

With everything (including
the sparkling production qual-
ity) working here for The Core,
there arises only one problem

with this singlezi it leaves you

hungry for more.

OH, NO! IT'S DEVO
Devo
Warner Bros.

Their new album is Oh, No.’ It's
DEVO——is that supposed to be a
premonition? The cover fea-
tures "the five spudboys," wear-

ing white ring collars and.

healthy—sized baking potatoes,
"hovering proudly above life's
highway searching for Bin,
Sweet Bin.” (That quote is from
the inner sleeve—I swear it is.
Cross my heart.) Don't expect a
trip to Private Idaho, though.
And don't knock yourself out
attempting to correlate the
enclosed music with any sort of
spud philosophy. Devo has got-
ten so far away from the potato
concept, originally explored on
the Duty Now For The Future
album, that the one reference to

it on Oh, No.’... seems like a bad‘

joke. On us.

At least the album isn't a car-
bon copy of their last three.
You'll find few traces of New
Traditionalism here—they've
attempted to recapture the

magic, but de—evolution is
against them. The result is a
gimmick—laden collection of
pop/pseudo-new wave dance
music, very structured, calcu-
lated and self—conscious. None
of the old spontaneity is here,
but it's still kind of fun
sometimes. i

The disc opens with "Time
Out for Fun." "Hello/This is
Devo," they remind us in case
we've forgotten. "We would like
to say things go both ways.”
Probably the best cut is "Peek-a-
Boo!" with odd "Ha, Ha, Ha's"
accompanying the nursery
rhyme lyrics: "Peek-a—Boo! Ican
see you.” Devo's songs have
never been accused of social sig-
nificance, but they're not as
whimsical as they used to be,
either.

What else? "What I Must
Do?" and "She's Out of Sync"
feature some interesting musi-
cal effects. "Explosions" is the
singular exponent of the potato
theory: "We do like music—-loud
shots from the big spudgun."
They say it twice. The Words
and Music Weird Prize goes to
"Speed Racer" for "I'm a Barbie
doll...I’ve got brains, and I like
sex" and a tune to match. The
rest of the album is‘ rather
unexceptional—filler items.

Oh, No.’ It's DEVO is a likable
enough album if you've never
heard any of the pre-"Whip It"
stuff, but if you have...Q: Are
we not DEVO? A: Not any
more.

Synthopop. It can be refresh-
ing and innovative at its best:
Human League, Soft Cell,
Kraftwerk. One tends to be
proud of society's accomplish-

not, though—that would be giv-

Yaz, really Yazoo, was

Depeche Mode made it big with

FRIEND OR FOE
Adam Ant
Epic/CBS

Adam and The Ants were one
of the greatest trash bands
ever-—as culturally important as
The Bay City Rollers and The
Partridge Family. Their import
LP, Dirlc Wears White Sox, and
Kings Of The Wild Frontier were,
seriously, massive amounts of
vinyl fun: silly meanings ("Ant-
music"!.7 what the...?) backed by
a beat that could slip discs and
slim thighs in a matter of
seconds. But along came last
year's Prince Charming, a limp,
wimp of an album that led us to
believe that the prince does turn
into a toad at the end of the fair-
ytale. Adam fired all ofhis Ants,
and it was concluded that that
was the end of that trend. Bring
on the Romantics (remember
them?), synthobands, the rock-
abillies, but...wait a minute-
the fairytale isn't over yet!
Somebody must've kissed the
frog, for Adam Ant is back, and,
believe it or not, with his best
effort to date.

Friend or Foe isn't as heavy on
the tribal rhythms as earlier
material (Bow Wow Wow has
taken over that department),
but that old toe-tapping, unre-
lenting beat dances all over this
effort. As far as I'm concerned,

‘bunch, and that should satisfy

even the most insatiable record-
buyers. But there's an added
incentive—the lyrics are sar-
donic and humorous, often pok-
ing fun at all the people who said
Ant was a has-been: "People love,
people hate, for my downfall they just
can’! wait/’ When showbiz is a dirty
word, hope my time will come..."

("Crackpot History and The

Right to Lie").

Friend or Foe is more fun than a
barrel of monkeys, and, perhaps
more importantly, it performs
the long—overdue task of put-
ting the punch back into pop.

pizza and milk, appetite and the
cafeteria or hygiene and "The
O," this album just doesn't fit
together. The first two songs
sound like the old operatic
AC/DC that sold all those mil-
lions of albums and made Pat all
those millions of dollars. These
are the ones getting radio air-
play, thereby lulling those of
you who trust FM D]s to guide
your musical tastes into a buy-

going to buy this album, only to
get it home and discover that
the other seven songs are new
wave, reminiscent of early
Blondie without the talent. Why
she did this I can't imagine——a
performer can only sound the
same so long before rigor mortis
of the brain sets in, but how Pat
thought she could change from
a teeny booper audio fantasy
into a new wave pleasure prin-

that she didn't make it is every-

SAX MANIAC

James White and the Blacks,

' Animal Records

Every teenager experiences
some form of an identity crisis.
One teenager made a career out
of it. James Siegfried grew up
with piano lessons, studying
jazz and classical music and
hanging out in rude go—go's. So
on he went to New York and a
string of unsuccessful jazz
attempts; he didn't fit in. He
didn't, until he found the
Bowery and CBGB's where

 

 

"JAMES WHITE

such bands as The Ramones,
Blondie and Talking Heads got
their start. This might be the
place for James Siegfried. His
stage antics and departure from
the 'MOR were readily accepted
by the CBGB crowd, and James’
career began.

Siegfried's signing with Ze
seemed appropriate; James’ alto
sax plays a dissonant funk, very
compatible with much of
today's Ze. His new name was
James Chance, and James
Chance and the Contortions
continued his funk sound until
he wanted to experiment with
disco——hence, James White and
the Blacks.

Back with funk, James opted
for the latter name and a new
label, Animal Records
(Chrysalis' new division). His
new album, Sax Maniac, follows
his old funk styles, updated with
better production and a more
polished sound that almost
ameliorates the dissonance of
his music. As a sax.player,James
White isn't as bad as he first
sounds. Those unconventional
harmonies, squeaks and spastic
progressions are part of his
style. James is talented and so is
his band, but the final product
of his talents, ambitions and
style lack the pleasantness
usually associated with good
music.

James Siegfried is caught up
in an extravagant form of
self—expression likely to remain
unappreciated outside of his
established cult. After listening
to Sax Maniac, one could easily
envision James White in a
smoke-filled basement lounge,
the beatnik kind of place worthy

of an experience too often
missed.

V DEEP.
The Boomtown Rats
Columbia

The Boomtown Rats have
been, at their best, funny, per-
verse and mildly entertaining;
at their worst, whiney and Con-
fused, trying to decide which
way to pull their audience while
muddling among themselves.

V Deep, their latest, merges
these two extremes into a con-
coction that, viewed as a whole,
still leaves the Rats fan with the
feeling that nothing much has
changed—we still have no idea
what it is exactly that they're
(or, should I say, what Bob Gel-
dorf is?) saying. Is it all sup-
posed to be Pop For Fun, or is it
Pop With A Meaning? V Deep
sure isn't telling.

‘ Musically, this isn't a bad
album, though it suffers slightly
from overproduction at the
hands of Tony Visconti. Indeed,
many of the cuts glide through
the executions almost effort-
lessly, Geldorf’s loopy lyrics and
all."'Talking In Code," "House
On Fire," with its reggae/salsa
beat, and the very Ricky Lee
Jones-ish (if she were an Irish
popster, that is) "The Little
Death" stand apart because
they don't seem to follow the
same formula as the rest of V
Deep. Everything else can pretty
much be lumped together. They
glide right by without a catch—
pretty, but with a monochrome,
airbrushed quality.

PLEASURE VICTIM
Berlin
MAO/Enigma Records

Berlin—consisting of John
Crawford, David Diamond,
Terri Nunn, and a few guest
performers—-sounds like the
Human League or Kraftwerk,
musically. It's electronic pop
art/new wave, smooth and
unemotional, except that they
use some honest-to-goodness
drums and guitars in addition to
the synthesizers. Vocalist Nunn
sounds a little like Blondie's
Debbie Harry with a slight
ragged edge. So why bother
with Pleasure Victim, Berlin's
debut?

Possibly because of the songs.
The album is salvaged primarily
by two good ones—”The
Metro," a Paris train trip
through a memory ("I'm alone.../I
remember a soldier sleeping next to me
riding on the Metro."); and "Tell
Me"Why," an "It's over" song
("You told me stay away, away./ lcan
hear the silence"). Both feature
sterile, almost hypnotic tunes
and charged vocals.

The rest of the album——with
the exception of a trashy
exercise entitled "Sex (I'm
A...)"—is unobjectionable but
rather ordinary. All but one of
the seven cuts on the disc were
written by Crawford, and he's
occasionally good at merging
the words and music. With two
outstanding songs and some
less notable material, Pleasure
Victm is acceptable fare. It will be
interesting to see if Berlin is able
to top "The Metro" and ”Tell
.Me Why" in the future.

Seven Wrestlers

Travel To Ohio

By TIM DINGER

Seven members of the Pitt Wres-
tling team travel to Dayton this
weekend to participate in the Ohio
Open Wrestling Meet.

Despite having 14 wrestlers out
with injuries, Coach Rande Stot—
tlemyer" remains optimistic about
the 1982-83 season.

“We are not overly concerned at
this point of time,” he said. “Most
of the guys, with the exception of
Jack Uppling, have minor injuries
and could be called back to action if
needed. But we really don't get roll-
ing until January.”

Uppling suffered a knee injury
in practice Monday. The extent of
the injury won't be known until a
knee scan is performed.

Freshmen Joe Bond and Kyle
Nellis are wrestling in theirfirst
collegiate competition. Stottle-
myer said he hopes the past public-
ity they received in high school
doesn't a'ffect them in a college
situation.

“Just because they had success in

"high school doesn't mean we
expect them to go out and win a big

tournament," Stottlemyer said.
“But we won't be surprised if they
both go out and win some
matches.”

Panthers competing in the Ohio
Open are Kurt Karanovich, Dan
Kasperkoski, Jeff Jelic, Joe
Throckmorton and Frank Rich.

Among the teams in the tourna-
ment are Kent State, Michigan
State, Ohio State, Cleveland State
and Indiana.

The Panthers are coming off a
good start in the West Virginia
open. Kasperkoski lead the Pan-
thers with a fourth-place finish,
and Eric Lobell, Rich Esswein and
Gary Bolin finish with 2-2 records
during the tourney. ,

“The upperclassmen did well by
getting some big wins,” assistant
coach. Chuck Coryea said. “The
younger guys are making progress.
They're trying new things now,
which is good because a pre-season
loss means nothing if you've
learned from it." A

Coryea’ was pleased with the
team, but admits it was too early to
get excited.

“We did all right, but we have to
keep our perspective about it; it is
only a pre-season tournament.”

Pitt Defeats Cbona,79-59

By SCOTT DELLETT

The names are different, but the
brand of basketball remains the
same. The Pitt Panther basketball
team used the same formula—a
tough, aggressive, pressing
defense—defeating Cibona of
Yugoslavia 79-59 in an exhibition
game at the Pitt Field House last
night.

Cibona, who has been defeated
by Villanova and Georgetown on
its tour of Big East circuit, never
challenged the Panthers, as Pitt
dominated the first half. The out-
side shooting of junior forward
Clyde Vaughan and the defense of
guards Charles Thompson,
George Allen and Billy Culbertson
made the difference.

“We played a number of defenses
tonight,” Coach Roy Chipman

Pitt Set

By IRA l(ATZ

The Pitt football team meets
Rutgers tomorrow afternoon at
Pitt Stadium in a game that will

long be remembered by the Panther i

seniors, who will be playing in
their final home game.

The game, however, takes on
more significance since bowl invi-

. tations will be extended imme-

diately following the game.

In all likelihood, a Pitt victory
would mean a trip to Dallas to play
in the Cotton Bowl.

.

Rutgers is looking realistically
at its chances of pulling off the big
upset. Last week against West Vir-
ginia, the Scarlet Knights gave the
Mountaineers a tough time early in
‘the game then fell apart in the
second half, losing 44-17.

“We play these name teams
tough for a half, make a big play,
and we begin to doubt ourselves.,"
said Rutgers linebacker Jim
Dumont.

A glance back to last year's Pitt-
Rutgers game, when the Panthers
only led 14-3 at the half, before
scoring 33 points in the second
half, is substantial evidence to
prove Dumont’s case.

Rutgers’ strength is the passing
arm of its southpaw quarterback
Jacques LaPrarie, who has com-
pleted 95 of 173 passes for 1,121
yards this season.

With all the upsets this year in
college football, Pitt may have an
opportunity to redeem itself and
get another shot at winning the
national championship.

said. “I kept changing the defense
to see what was successful.”

Every Panther saw action, which
presented some problems for
Chipman.

“With the number of people in
the lineup, we had some problems
with the rhythm,” Chipman said.
“If we had only eightplayers in, we
would have had a little more
rhythm. After we got the big lead in
the second half, the guys started to
think it was easy."

But the large margin presented
Chipman with the opportunity to
give some freshmen playing time.
The third-year coach had some
mixed reviews. '

“I thought the freshmen did
what we expected them to,” Chip-
man said. “Joey David played well
offensively, but he needs some

The Pitt Panthers hope to have mor cenesl is

more work on defense. Keith Arm-
stong did his job on defense.

“Bryan Mitchell was shaky
tonight. His problem has been
picking up the stuff rather than a
lack of ability.” 5

Armstrong, whom many con-
sider to be the key to the team’s
success in the Big East, was satis-
fied with certain parts of his game.

“Defense-wise, I was happy with
my play,” Armstrong said. Offen-
sively, I could have done better.
They had some big men plugging
up the middle.

“I need to be in better shape
physically.”

“I think it is tougher on the
freshmen mentally rather‘ than
physically,” Vaughan ‘said. “I
know how it is—I was in that
position.”

“As I told them last week, when
somebody gives you a second
chance, you’ve got to go after it."'
Pitt coach Foge Fazio said earlier
this week. “If we win the next two
and get in a good bowl, there’s no
telling what will happen.”

“Everybody else is saying that if
they win their last two and a bowl
game, they'll be the best team in
college football." Fazio added

a national championship, it must
rectify some offensive problems
that have plagued the team all
season.

“If I knew the answer, it would
be corrected," said Pitt offensive
coordinator Joe Daniels. “If it were
one specific thing, it would be easy
to solve the problem."

“A lot of time, our intensity isn't
what it should be," Daniels added.
“When one or two things go
wrong, suddenly we're pressing.”

 Norwin King Of Hill In High School Volleyball

By MARK A. SINDLER

It is the kind of stuff that makes
dynasties. It's a heavily fortified
powerhouse that grinds out victo-
ries with the efficiency of a finely-
tuned Formula 1 engine.

The castle-on-the-mountainside
that is being referrred to here is the
women's volleyball bastion at Nor-
win High School, coached by
Sharon Watson. >

She is in her 12th year at Norwin
and has coached 10 different teams
to WPIAL titles, the last seven of
which won state championships.

And this year? Oh...Watson is in
the midst of claiming her eighth
straight title.

Still, she disclaims at:-3. thoughts
of immortality. “It‘s difficult to say
_ . ‘ _

“because I'm not too familiar with
the other teams in the country."
Good point. However, although
Watson could not release actual
won-loss figures during her tenure,
figures add up to approximately
400 wins and less than 10 losses.
Watson's sports program, there-
fore, is no ordinary one. As such,
she is, and has been, hosts to many
college recruiters, including Pitt
coach Shelton Collier. “No team in
the state has a team like Norwin,"
Collier said. “There's Norwin,
then there’s a big drop-off.”
Because of NCAA rules, Collier
cannot relay information on pros-

pective recruits unless those names _

are brought to his attention first.
Even so, Collier is prepared to hit
the recruiting road very early.

“I have been recruiting very

said. “The process includes send-
ing athletes articles from The Pitt
News, The Press, Post-Gazette and
other sources that give the team
notoriety.”

Collier wants to bring in four or
five freshmen for a squad that will
be losing three seniors. Schools
Collier is looking at include Bald-
win, Plum, Farrell, Kiski and
Richland. Baldwin and Plum are
the teams right behind Norwin in
talent, Collier said.

In Pennsylvania, a hotbed itself
for bumper crops of volleyball
players, Norwin is The Team. Is
Norwin's .975 (winning percen-
tage) team a perennial machine?

“We work very hard for (wins),"
Watson said. “My teams play with
intensity and precision and try not

to make unforced. errors like men-

a very good understanding of a
winning program. They are very
disciplined.”

When attempting to establish a
rationale behind her extraordinary
success story, Watson points to her
squad's assets. Shew knows her
team's strengths and exploits them
accordingly. How many weak-
nesses can there be in ‘teams that
have lost just 10 times in 10 years?

The absence of soft spots on Wat-
son's teams, though, can be
explained by the difference in cir-
cumstances between colleges and
high school competition.

“In high school," Watson said,
“there is more ‘concentration on the
sport itself. Studies aren't as diffi-
cult, and there aren't many distrac-
tions. Even the travel isn’t .as

Watson has been fortunate to
have “dedicated players.” She
added that her athletes take advan-
tage of developmental camps dur-
ing summer months. -

“Many have attended Shelton’s
summer. program and have tra-
veled with his junior team,” she
said.

‘Currently, Collier has one Nor-
win graduate on his squad. Sally

player on the team, not only has
reflected four years of disciplined
training in her play this season. but
has also added needed leadership to
the team.

Evidence That Great Players Come In All Sizes

(Editor’s note: This is the second
of a six-part series on former Pitt
greats. The excerpts have been
taken from Jim O’Brien and Marty
Wolfson’s book, “Hail To Pitt.”)

Press

“He’s a living monument to

great teaching.” _D0C Carlson

There were six of them and they
represented Pittsburgh at its best in
basketball.

In their time, they could dribble,
shoot and rebound with anybody.
They included Chuck Cooper,
Dick Groat, Ed Fleming, Don Hen-
non, Connie Hawkins and Brian
Generalovich.’ What a team they’d
be!

They were sitting together at a
showcase table for the Curbstone
Coaches’ Eastern 8 Basketball
Championship luncheon at the
Allegheny Club in March of 1981,

and a sellout crowd paid tribute to
them as well as the league's award
winners.

“It was nice for old-time’s sake,"
said Dr. Hennon, now a 43-year-
old general surgeon here. “I like to

see those guys, and find out how
they’re doing these days."

Dr. Hennon is the smallest of the
six, but that is nothing new. As a
junior at Pitt during the 1957-58
season, Hennon, at 5-8 1/2, 185,
was the smallest member of a six-
man All-American team that had
to be the greatest of all time.

It included Wilt Chamberlain of
Kansas, the tallest at 7-1, Bob
Boozer of Kansas State, Elgin Bay-
lor of Seattle, Oscar Robertson of
Cincinnati, Guy Rodgers of Tem-

' ple, and Hennon. Pitt’s sports pub-
'licist at the time, Beano Cook,

pushed unsuccessfully to get a pic-
ture of Hennon posed with Dr.
Jonas Salk, who developed a polio-
vaccine during his stay at Pitt, and
label them “Pitt’s two greatest
shotmakers.”

In his senior year, Hennon and
the Panthers slipped somewhat
from their previous season's per-
formance. While he was not a con-
sensus All-American in his final
year, he was named to the UPI first
team that included Robertson,
Boozer, Bailey Howell of Missis-
sippi State and Jerry West, ajunior
at West Virginia University.

Hennon’s No. 10 was retired,
and he still holds many of Pitt’s
all-time scoring records, averaging
24.2 points over three varsity sea-
sons. Only Larry Harris, who
played for four seasons, scored
more career points (1,914) .‘than

5

Hennon (1,841).

Hennon had been schooled in
basketball since he was l0when his
father, L. Butler Hennon, hung a
basketball hoop in the cellar of
their home. He played for his
father at Wampum High School,
near New Castle. and they were a
winning combination, taking the
state Class B title in Don's senior
year. Don's dad was a brilliant bas-
ketball coach, and used all sorts of
practice innovations—dribbling
blindfolded and around chairs—to
improve fundamental skills.

As Pitt’s Hall of Fame basketball
coach, Dr. H. C. Carlson, said of
Don Hennon: “He’s a living mon-
ument to great teaching. He is also
living proof that a great basketball
player cannot be measured by size
alone. The heart still has a lot to do
with winning games.”

Bob Timmons was the basket-
ball coach at Pitt when Hennon

was playing, but Doc Carlson, then
the head of the student medical ser-
vice, helped sell Hennon on stay-
ing here to play college ball.

Dr. Hennon, who was among
the record crowds at this weekend's
Eastern 8 Tournament at the Civic
Arena, said he came across a letter
Dr. Carlson had written him when
he was going through some of his
memorabilia. '

“Doc was a very realistic per-
son," said Hennon, “and he said in

this year has solidified my feelings
of her as a great college player. She
has an abundance of mental attri-
butes with a real winning
attitude."

Accordingly, Collier rates Wat-
son’s program as superior. He said
that she lends a great deal of matur-
ity and an outstanding skill-
development level that rubs off on
her players.

Players have a great deal of
respect for her,” Collier said.

. “Sharon presents herself in a way

that when players play for her and
around her, they become first class
athletes.”

Considering the caliber of com-
pliments, Collier has not recruited
many Norwin athletes lately. First,
he has only been recruiting around
here for two years, and second,
players such as Ulana Kohutiak

and Carmen Tapia have surfaced
with a better talent than other ath-
letes in their classes.

“When evaluating players,"
Collier continued, “our philo-
sophy at Pitt the last couple of
years has been to look for mental
toughness and not just height.
Some coaches have different criter-
ia, and mine is that players have to
fit into the program personality-
wise with a strong attitude.

“If I have a girl in there at 13-13
(score), and she's 5-6, 5-7, up
against one who’s 6-0 but who will
shy away from the ball, there’s no
question who I will take. I want
someone who won't crack.”

Besides Pennsylvania, Collier
travels to Canada and Puerto Rico
to find prospects. Holly Martino, a
staff assistant, handles about 90
percent of all recruiting now,
which means promoting Pitt as a
fine all-around institution and

gathering and sending informa-
tion about Pitt and the recruits.

GAME SERVES: Referring to
her as a “one-woman wrecking
crew," Collier explained outside
hitter Pat Belcher’s role in almost
single-handedly defeating West
Virginia Wednesday, 15-11, 15-4,
15-1.

“The WVU match,” Collier
remarked, “will be remembered as
the Pat Belcher match. She virtu-
ally dominated everyone with
intense blocking and spiking at the
net.”

Belcher's performance against
WVU, Collier added, is needed
while preparing for the NCAA’s.
There have always been other play-
ers, such as Judy Young, Diane
Zack and Ulana Kohutiak, who
have taken individual roles in the
past, but Belcher received her time
in the limelight on Wednesday.

With Don Hennon, Size

his ‘letter when I was being recru-
ited, ‘Look, you'll go to North
Carolina State and Duke and Mary-
land and they’-ve all got beautiful
campuses. They're out of this
world. But, remember, you can’t
eat grass. Come to Pitt and play
where you’re going to work some-
day.’ ”

It was sound advice.

“I wanted to be a physician when
I came to Pitt,” he recalled. “I
wanted to be a doctor; I didn’t

know then that I’d be a surgeon. I
never worried about not being 6-6.
Doc Carlson used to tell me about
Bobby Brown, a third baseman for
the New York Yankees. who went
to medical school and became a
doctor when he retired from base-
ball. He thought you should have a
future beyond basketball."

I)r. Hennon thinks that too
many of today’s youngsters see
sports as an end in themselves.
“They see the big money the pros
are making, and you can’t blame
them for wanting that,” he said.

But the odds are so heavily
weighed against realizing such
goals. Of every senior starter on a
high school basketball team in this
country, one out of 40,000 makes it
in the National Basketball Associa-
tion. In truth, it’s easier to become
a doctor, a lawyer, a scientist, a
teacher, a contributing citizen.

After playing in a series of exhi-
bitions for the Cleveland Pipers of
the American Basketball League,
along with the likes of Dick Barnett
and Ben Warley, Hennon devoted

Pitt. He's not sorry.

He's a general surgeon at Alle-
gheny General Hospital, Passa-
vant and Suburban General
Hospital. Andhe still plays basket-

ball witn his boys in their backyard
in the northern suburb of Franklin
Park. Don Jr. is a 6-foot freshman

Rob is a 5-11 junior at North
Allegheny High School, and Scott
is a seventh grade member of the
Ingomar Middle School team. Don
also has a daughter, Kim, who's a

Dick Groat says Hennon had one
of the best outside shots he ever saw
in basketball, and apparently he
hasn't lost his touch. “He can still
shoot,” reported Don's wife, Made-
line, a former nurse from Weirton,
W. Va., “but he can’t run anymore

because he has arthritic knees.”

Which means he doesn’t shoot
that running push shot going into
the corner anymore.

he said, “but I tell my boys that
basketball isn’t necessarily going
to be your life.”
