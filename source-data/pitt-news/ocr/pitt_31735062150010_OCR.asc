In revealing the dates of inter-
views, Machesney said that ‘‘All un-

ity to present their qualiﬁcations and
their past records.”

Although “retiring editors will be
consulted and their recommendations
considered,” Mach.esney added that
the choice will not necessarily be
“conﬁned to students now actively
engaged in publications wor .”

The following qualities have been
adopted as the basis for the selection:

Experience, demonstrated writing
ability, initiative, technical knowl-
edge of printing, and leadership. The
printing requirements will be re-

In Presidential Possibilities Poll

Student Opinion Surveys of America

AUSTIN, Texas, May 5—American
college youth have picked a new
number one presidential possibility
in their own poll, the Student Opinion
Surveys of America.

He is Democrat Paul V. McNutt,
48-year-old high commissioner to the
Philippines and former college pro-
fessor, whose White House boom has
been one of the ﬁrst to get under way.

Running a close second in the favor
of the college students was the even
more youthful Thomas  Dewey, the
37-year-olcl Republican district at-
torney of New York.

Miss Carrier, C41, who was forced
to give up her work as costume di-
rector because her brother is in the
hospital with typhoid fever, explain-
ed, “I’m quarantined. They are
afraid I might be a carrier.” Ger-

A number of Old costumes have
been obtained from the Presbyterian
Home for Old Folks, and the WPA
provided the ladies’ hats for the show.
But one of the particular difficulties
has been in ﬁnding a white, full-

UNIQUE PLAY

Most of the 22 principals have sev-
eral changes of costume which, in ad-
dition to the great number of extras,
about 20, makes the work of the cos-

ident William Benswanger was una-

One of the most unique plays ever

are used to heighten the illusions.

"NUSUAL is the announcement in The News

and on campus bulletin-boards today that the
rolls are open for applications for the positions of
editor and business manager of the three student
_publications at the University.

Says the communique, from the office of the ad-
viser to student publications, “All undergraduates,
regardless of staff experience, will be given an op-
porlistiiiity to present their qualiﬁcations” and
choice will not necessarily be “conﬁned to stnclents
now actively engaged in publications work.”

Now it appears that the matter of choosing pub-
lication heads wil.l be a “come one—comc all” pro-

_ cedure, with anyone, regardless of lack of experi-
ence, eligible to throw in his oar. At first mention,
this seems absolutely undemocratic.

But maybe we are not being open-minded about
the new plan. After all, does not the very essence
of democratic procedure lie in the widening of op-
portunity, in giving every person the right to 
pirc to positions of rcsponsibiliizy and importance?

It matters little, of course, that these aspirants
inayhave ’absolutely no knowledge of the position
to which they aspire, may have never had any ex-
perience on the publication concerned.

The new motto for publications seems to be “An
equal chance for all.” We suppose that is in keep-
ing with the policy of giving the publications
“back to the students” and divesting‘ authority
from those miserable scoundrels who have been
usurping those positions of late.

VVc hope everyone in the University will take
advantage of this offer. Already we can envision
the long line of applicants which will stream in
never-ending numbers into the office of publica-
tions aclviser lllacliesncy tomorrow.

For it is really such a nice, soft job, Eeiiig editor
or business manager of The News or the Panther
or the Owl. There are no worries, a minimum of
Work, and all one needs do is to be able to look im-
pressive, put one ’s foot on the desk in the approved
manner, and be able to sign an “X” on the back of
the big salary check each month.

Bi1't we would even go farther i.n the line of. sug-
gestions. ‘Wlrv limit the choice to the University?
Tliere are any number of good inexperienced nieii
in the city who are eager for tlic opportunity. ‘.‘~.’hy

pa.13c2‘-‘st  for (3illl(ll(.l{‘-.liCfS. That would be a

Onlv real rcquircincnt for tlie

-.4

positions, of

course, should be the “'ri;.§l1t attitude” toward
tliings. 'l.‘li:-it, naturally, will require careful selec-

tion and hand-picking.

.\Vc are looking forward to the student body ’:;
reaction. So pardon us while we go out and put
in our application for the presidency of SFA.

On sc::.o;§u:,l tlicitigjlit maybe we better stay in the
office. l?=’or the entire sports department is up at
the stadiuni applying for a backﬁeld position with
Charley Bowser’s football team. And the report-

Brown Study . . .

by Robert Brown:

About this time of year, The News office goes sour.
May comes around, and with it a black, dirty cloud of
disillusionme-nt hits the entire staff.

For it is spring on the campus. It is the time when
the lawn mowers putter slcepily across the grass, time
when the coeds begin wearing print
dresses and saying “You don’t mean
it, mister,” in their soft Pennsylvania
drawls, and in the evenings the fra-
ternity men are out in the driveway
throwing a baseball around and
young couples walk hand in hand
along the dark walks around the Uni-
versity. And it is then that the ideals
and aims we have fought for since
September begin to seem cheap and
insincere.

On the surface, it is nothing more
than a good case of sour grapes. We
indulge in the luxury of a little self pity, and it is a ra-
tianallzation that is pretty nice. This week, the Cap
and Gown boys are enjoying the curtain calls they get
down at the Nixon, and we must sit up here in a lousy, i

little office and pound out copy. We should like to ask 5
the blonde girl with the nice laugh who sits next to us
in the sixth hour class for a date, but the paper does
not wait for dates, and so must juggle type around at

aFrankfurter, Herbert Hoover, Alfred

the printers and watch the linotype men stab at their
machines and listen to the great drum of the pressl
with a feeling that is much stronger than boredom. That 
girl is probably out at a dance with somebody else,,
anyway . . . l

The Journalisfs Tragedy

But underneath this veneer that will be worn off with
time, there is a much stronger, a much more powerful
factor. For it is a great tragedy of the journalist that
he cannot be a part of the great, full world of which he
writes. All about him, men are engaged in the active
life, and he must forget this, and live in a circumscrib-
ed area made up of paste pots and telephones and type-
writers and stories about people whose lives are ut-
terly foreign to his own.

It is this challenge which the student journalist must
face. He must realize that the press, with all of its
faults, may still be the most profound inﬂuence for
good in the modern world. This is the ideal state, of
course. He will receive the usual complaints from
dance chairmen who are sore about the amount of
space they get, and if he sees faults in some phase of
student government, he is liable to be called a “red.”
And he will realize that the power he wields is an un-
mixed blessing, for he will miss many of the things
that make the University life worth while.

S elf-A p p raisal Necessary

Consequently, he must take constant appraisal of him-
self. He must realize that he is young, and that he is
more easily swayed by what he sees and hears than
his older colleagues.
sometimes flow from under his ﬁngers with a strange,
lyrical power, and that when his copy appears in cold
print, it is not what lie meant to say at all. But he
should realize, above all, that he can be the greatest in-
ﬂuence in his University for good, and can evolve a set
of ethics that will be good for his University, his fel-
low students, and himself.

And then, he will realize that journalism is a warm,
l;i.ving, intezfral part of  life that looks so good, and
:35; just that.

INDIANA ENIGMA
The popularity of the former In-

lege students may be attributed to
several factors, (1) his supporters
have started a boom calling him a
“conservative liberal,” which hap-
pens to be in keeping with the col-
legiate sentiment that has been shown
in other surveys, (2) Mc:Nutt forces
have been among the first actively to
bid for support, and (3) he has been
affiliated with education as a pro-
fessor and dean of the Indiana Uni-
versity law school.

Even before the earliest days of broadcasting,
Bell System engineers developed means of trans-

oodruff Nears End
f Pitt Track Career

Johnny VVoodruff, C39, without doubt stands out as the greatest

last home meet of his college career.
And to celebrate the occasion, Coach
Carl Olson has named Johnny cap-
tain of this year’s great track team.

His popularity with Pitt students in
general and his teammates in partic-
ular make him an especially suitable
leader. Woodruff is one of the great-
est individual performers to ever rep-
resent Pitt in any sport and a huge
crowd is expected to be on hand to
see him make his ﬁnal home appear-
ance.

WORLD’S BEST RECORD

The giant-striding Woodruff has
compiled the most impressive track
record of any runner in the world.
In his senior year at Connellsville
High School, Johnny set a new state,
W. P. I. A. L., and Fayette County
record for the mile and placed sec-
ond in the Junior Nationals in the
mile at Lincoln, Nebraska. I-le for-
merly held the national interscho-
lastic mile record and the A. M. A.
880 yard mark.

Probably his busiest year as a
runner was his freshman year at Pitt.
He started off as captain and number
one man on the yearling cross coun-
try team and ﬁnished his first collegi-
ate year as Olympic 800 meter cham-
pion. After establishing himself at
the Olympiad in Germany as the
world’s greatest middle distance run-
ner, he went to England where he
anchored a two mile relay quartet
that set a world record.

SETS EUROPEAN STANDARD

Later in the summer, he went to
Norway and there anchored a world’s
‘record Swedish relay team. He also
won the 400 meters in this meet in
46.8 seconds, his ﬁrst test at this dis-
tance in fast company. J ohnny’s next
triumph came in a half-mile race in
a triangular meet between United
States, France, and Japan at Paris.
Here he also ran anchor on a win-
ning team of which Glenn Cunning-
ham was a member.

In his sophomore year he was still
busy breaking old records and set-
ing new ones. He was on the var-
sity cross coi.mtry' team and was un-
A:ie1?ea.t'3cl in dual track competition.

Besides winning the National Col-
legiate and National A. A. U. half
mile events. he took first place in

half miler and middle distance runner in the world.

records, and now after five years of strenuous competition track ex-
perts claim he is just reaching his peak.

mile events and anchored the sprint
medley relay team to a ﬁrst place
and new world record in the Penn
Relays.

That summer he reeled off a daz-
zling 1147.8 half mile in whipping
world record holder Elroy Robinson
at Dallas, Texas. This was two sec-
onds under the world mark, but the
track was a paltry three feet short-—
one-thi.rd of one of Johnny’s huge
strides-—and the record was not rec-
ognized. Johnny then went to Japan
where he set a new Japanese stand-
ard of 43 ﬁat for the quarter.

MAY BE BEST YEAR

In the Penn Relays of 1938, Johnny
further distinguished himself by
anchoring three Pitt teams to ﬁrst
places in the mile, half mile, and
mile sprint medley relays, lowering
the world record in the latter event.

This year, Woodruff’s amazing re-
 performance in the recent Penn
Relays at Philadelphia indicates that
his last year at Pitt will be his great-
est. One of Long John’s big ambi-
tions this year is to win the I. C. 4-A.
440 and 880 titles for the third time,
for he thus can establish a record
that no runner will ever better in
three years of competition. The only
other man to ever win these titles
two years in succession was Ted
Ivleredith, Olympic 800 meter chain
in 1912. "

Johnny will be 24. years old on July
5th. A sociology major, he is inter-
ested in Urban League work in which
he plans to engage in New York after
his graduation. Like most athletes,
Johnny is interested in other sports.
Baseball was once his first love.

He also likes tennis and football.
In fact, Johnny Lerew, Connellsville
high tra.ck coach, saw him playing
football for his high school team and
recognized his track potentialities.
He induced him to try out for track
and the rest is history.

Woodruff thinks that Glenn Cun-
ningliam, the master miler, is the
greatest athlete he has ever met. He
has regard for Glenn as an athlete
and a character and claims that if
the mile is ever to be run in four min-

utes, Cunningham will be the first

one to do it.

lntranunrals

With the start of competition in
tennis and golf, the intramural pro-
gram is now running on a complete
schedule.

“Complete” is not exactly the
right word, progress in most of the
program up to now has been far
from complete. In fact, only the fra-
ternity mushball league shows any-
thing like sustained competition.

Independent and Engineering
schedules are sagging badly from an
epidemic of forfeits, and the frater-
nity horseshoe pitchers are little bet-
ter. Laziness is presumably the main
trouble. A program of “athletics for

all” can and must have more cooper-
ation from the students.

As in other sports, tennis and golf
teams have begged for places in the
league. What they will do now re-
mains to be seen.

Monday’s golf schedule shows 10
fraternity and four engineering teams
in action. Since the double elimina-
tion method makes exact scheduling
of matches impossible, team mana-
gers must keep in touch with the in-
tramural oﬂice.

Rain and forfeits walked off with
the decision over the program sched-
uled for Monday and Tuesday.

Honorary Fraternities Will Tap
Undergraduates at Assemblage

(This is the ﬁnal story of a series describing the features of Spring;

Festival week).

By Lewis Riley
Tap Day is the activity of Spring Festival week that is most ac-V

curately called “traditional.”

On this day there is a premium on participation in campus activi-

ties throughout the year.

All the extra-curricular honorary fraternities tap deserving un-
dergraduates to membership at the annual Tap Day assembly, sched-

uled this year for Friday, May 12,‘?

from 10:30 to 12:30 o’clock in Soldiers’
Memorial hall.

Among the honorary fraternities to
tap next week are Cwens, honorary
sophomore activities fraternity for
women, and Druids, honorary sopho-
more activities for men. Tappees to
both organizations are chosen on a
basis of campus activity participa-
tion and scholastic proﬁciency.

Participants in Cap and Gown pro-
ductions are eligible for membership
in the Cap and Gown Club, which
will add members to its rolls on Tap
Day.

Scabbard and Blade, honorary mil-
itary fraternity, and Xylon, honorary
journalism fraternity for women, will
also tap to membership.

Omicron Delta Kappa, national
honorary activities fraternity for men,
will cite the outstanding man in the
senior class as the recipient of the
coveted Senior Award.

Mortar Board, senior women’s
honorary fraternity, will tap junior
women on a basis of scholarship, ac-
tivities, and leadership.

Better Late . . .

High light of the Tap Day assem-
bly is the announcement of this year’s
Alma Mater and Senior Queen. The
chosen women are sought among the
assembly audience and are escorted
to the platform for student acclama-
tion.

Deeply rooted in the traditions of
Tap Day is the century-old “Cere-
mony of the Spoon” imported to the
University from Cambridge. Twenty
outstanding junior men and women
will open the ceremony by crossing
the auditorium platform. The
“Spoon” is then dipped with the ap-
proach of the outstanding man and
woman from among the twenty
“worthies.”

The University spoon was hewn
from a walnut tree that grew on the
former campus at Third avenue and
Cherry street. Presented to a senior
class by Chancellor George Woods as
a unique citation for lack of good
conduct and scholarship, the spoon
has come down through University
history with a rare background of
the rough and ready middle—nine-
teenth century life at the University.

THE PITT NEWS

Over 200 Freshman

Men Participate

In Various Extra-curricular Activities

ticipated in extra-curricular activi-
ties this semester, the Dean of Men’s
office has reported. “The class of ’42
has already shown its keen interest
in activities,” Robert R. Corley, as-
sistant dean of men, stated.

, Publications, athletics, dramatics,
forensics, and social organizations
have all been heavily patronized.
Many men have participated in more
than one activity. Almost a third
of the 700 men registered have joined
one of the “Y” Freshman clubs.
About ten per cent have gone out for
publications and dramatics.

According to Mr. Corley, “Campus
activity participation is considered a
prerequisite for consideration as out-
standing freshmen.” Those men in:

Esiliihition

articles on the University’s art gal-
lery, dealing with its h:7.story, ex-
hibits, and permanent works of art.
By John Bro-sky
Important for showing a relation-
ship of colors and ideas in two dis-
tinctive ﬁelds are two Russian icons
and a landscape painting which are
part of the permanent collection of
the University ﬁne arts gallery.
Rich in composition of the period
of Catherine the Great, “The Resur-
rection of Christ,” an eighteenth cen-
tury icon, represents several mean-
ings of a prayer in pictorial form.
The icon is painted on a wooden
base. In the center of the painting
Christ is rising to the sky from the
grave, about which are angels in
military uniform. At the lower right,
Christ is descending into Limbo.
On one-half of the painting, the
demon is chained and held by two

in Parliament of the all-important
measure—the budget.

“Stories about war are not played
up in the London and Paris newspa-
pers as they are in this country,” says
Cox. “Although the people are calm
about European events, there seems
to be more tension in London than in
Paris.” M

According to Fullerton, the crowds
in Whitehall street outside Parliament
eagerly awaited Hitler’s reply to
President Roosevelt’s message.

Fullerton reports that there are
signs all over London encouraging
enlistment. Both he and Cox were
impressed by the constant ﬂight of
war planes over London and Paris,
the extensive air raid shelters being
built, and the installation of perma-

nent anti—aircraft guns in Paris. ,

is nailed to the cross, which is grow-
ing from the skull of Adam.

In the icon, “Dormination of the
Virgin,” aiso an eighteenth century
painting, the background suggests the
Sienese art of the fourteenth century’
at the time of Duccio.

The painting develops a belief of‘
the Greek Church, that the Virgin is.

the Mother of God and never dies.

The newest acquisition to the art"
gallery is the painting, “St. Malo.”'
by Jean Julien Le Mordant. It is a
landscape of the coast of Brittany,
done in pastel shades with a har-
mony of colors.

The painting represents the im-
pressionistic style which France de-
veloped so brilliantly in the nine-
teenth century. For classroom use,
the works of art in the gallery are
more useful than photographs or
slides.
