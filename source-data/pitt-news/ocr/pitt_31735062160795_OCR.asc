Instructor Predicts Success

A
V

— Pianist Serenades,
Studies, Teaches

And Enjoys It All
“By LORRAINE LESOON

Highlighting the coffee
hour in the Student Union
Lounge last Wednesday was
a piano concert presented by
Linda Greer.

Linda, a part time student,
is"no stranger to University mu-
sic lovers since she has already
given several programs here.

She spends an average of five
to six hours a day practicing, with

the goal of becoming a concert A

pianist. She began to study music
at the age of four, and today her
teacher is the noted Selmar Jan-
son, former head of the piano
department at Carnegie Tech.

Janson says that in addition to
being very talented Lindahas an
amiable personality which is an
important asset in any career. He
foresees a career as a concert
pianist for Linda. _

Janson’s prophecies A have-~
been realized in the past
through former students Ethel
Smith, famous organist, Hugh
Carter, head of the music de-

_ partment of Northwestern Uni-

’ versity and Eugene Sol, popular
pianist. .
Linda, who has already played

several concerts at Carnegie Mu-.

sic Hall with Dr. Marshall Bid-
well, admits that as a youngster
she was never confronted with
any vocational problems.
Has Life-Long Desire

‘_‘I have always wanted to be a
pianist,” she said. “It’s so won-
derful to hope to someday make
your living doing somethingiyou
love so much.”

In addition -to playing the
piano, Linda still ﬁnds time for
other activities. She teaches
Sunday School, gives piano les-
sons. and is a member of the

** Westminster Foundation.
“Teaching Sunday-School is one

 

 I’ M" ‘ LINDA GREEK

An Amiable Person

of the most interesting experiences lsound, touch, and analysis of mu-

I. have ever had,” she remarked.
“It’s the type of job that makes
you crystalize your thoughts so
that you may impart them to
others.”
Partial to Classics
Although she enjoys all types
of .music, Linda admits that she
is. partial to the classics. A
“I think that there would be
a tremendous void in my life
without the classics. It is some-
thing that grows and¢somehow
becomes a part of you.”

Linda feels that in order for
a pianist to play the classics, he
must recreate what the composer
ha-swritten and incorporate a part
of himself into it. 

The aspiring pianist points out
that the four basic factors in
learning to play music are sight,

SlC.

A valuable asset to Linda is
her perfect pitch. This is the
ability to recognize a note by
sound. It enabled her to play
many compositions by car at a
very early age.

In addition to the piano, she
has studied the ﬂute and has also
taken voice lessons. At the age
of ten, Linda sang a solo in U
recital at Mt. Lebanon High
School. She graduated in 1956
from that school. V

Sang Itiln German

The title of the song was “The
Little Sandman” written by
Brahms. Linda sang the selection
in German. This was considered
quite an accomplishment for a
ten-year-old.

   CR 0 Scores

Student Council of Religious Organizations has struck
a blow for religious freedom at as time when some of our
‘leading’ universities are openly confessing theirlack of it.
With schools across the country looking into the needs
of students in the area of religion, Pitt’s answer is somewhat

unusual but amazingly effective.

As it is with all great innovations, one is tempted to
*ask why this simple answer wasn’t thought of before.

‘ SCRO has brought forward a four yearprogram of in-
viting~»a full team of outstanding representatives of the four
major U.S. Faiths to speak before religious interest groups.

p Prejudice has appeared in large gasps on some prom-
. inent campuses. If these schools actually represent-a good
cross-section of-American thought it is an indication of a
growing separation from formal religion and a correspond-
ing increase of bigotry and intolerance. Since these views
have been justiﬁed by some of our most conspicuous citi-

zens, this picture looks accurate.

V Rejection of formal religion is one thing, but rejection
of others for their beliefs is causefor these institutions to
take a long, cfitical look ‘at themselves. The Soviet system '
of total rejection of;God at ‘least eliminate religious intoler-

The Unsilent; Generation . . .

. ‘By MILLARD AMDUR
(Editor’s Note: This is the first of three articles
on “The Unsile-nt Generation,” a book written by
Princeton seniors.) "

“The Unsilent Generation” is a composite of
eleven young Princeton seniors’ views of life, views
so shallow that one might wish they had remained
silent. 4

This book, edited by Otto Butz, John Wither-
spoon Bicentennial Preceptor in Politics at Prince-
ton, is claimed on the ﬂy leaf
to be the portrayal of the es-
sentialunsilent aspect of Amer-
ican youth. Further, it purports
to be a hopeful picture of young
men. The reader tends to won-A
der on what aspect that hope is
based. .

In the first place, these anon-
ymous biographies show a var-
iety of backgrounds and emo-
tional problems, culminating in
present psychoses. You would
think that at least a few Princetonians came from
normal happy home surroundings but, if as the
book implies, this is a fairly representative’ group,
we learn that they are mostly quite the contrary.

We might go so far as to say that these stu-
dents are the consequences of troubled childhood
in their denial, almost to a man, of religion and
some of the humanistic values some college stu-
dents hold dear.

The unsilent men portray religious and racial
bias at Princeton that in this dayland age these

.self-styled intellectual superiors should have

stamped out. ~

_,This prejudice applies to Catholics, Jews and

Negroes, although as one young man mentions, .

there are virtually no Negroes there despite
Princeton’s purportedliberalism. If this be true,
perhaps the admissions policy at Princeton is gear-
ed toward ﬁnding intellectual superiors only where
they care to look for them, hardly very wordly.

Unfosfy Sampling: ’

Or maybe, we hypothesize, they fear riots on
the part of the young gentleman type, similar to
one of those who contributed an article to this mo-
mentous opus. ,

It is indeed unfortunate that a book worthless
as this may be considered representative to some

I am!” The implication is that where he really is
he doesn’t know. He speaks of the typical (for the
book anyway) troubled childhood. He relates that
his mother’s biggest mistake in life was marrying
his father. A \

Speaking of the time his father voluntarily join-
ed the ranks of the unemployed, “Dad could have
found himselfa job as a jeweler, but because he
wanted to maintain the facade that he was a re-

" tired man, he just puttered around in his garden.”

A divorce ensued with the lad knowing what the

‘ courts did not know, that “Dad” has told his moth-

er that if she tried to take him, Dad ‘would kill

both himself and the helpless youth. It’s phen0m- >v

enal, isn’t it?

He speaks of his adoption by a Princeton man
when things seemed bleakest, but even here. there
were emotional trauma. It seemsthat the wife of.
this gentleman was stubborn; sarastic, and conde-

scending. The boy sarcastically penned after a list

of her far from admirable traits, “She is a devout
Catholic, who will have both strong faith and many
works on her‘record when she knocks at the Gate.”

* Apparently trying to convincehimself, he ends
his discussion of his foster mother with the words,
“I am very much in debt to this second mother of
mine—and I do love her.’’, The reader has trouble
believing this. ‘

Mediocrify Despises Hie Masses

Let’s move on to some of the other earthshaking

opinions of this Princetonian: “I feel sure I’m in-
te1ligent—-'or else I wouldn’t be at Princeton. I’m

not poised at all. To many people whom I don’t
know very well, I’m usually rather quiet.” Etc.,

etc.

“I want to be more capable than the "mediocre
masses, whom I despise because of their apathy
and mediocrity.” ‘

One would think that coming from the back-
ground this lad does, he would realize that many
among the mediocre masses are not members of
this group by choice but by circumstance as he

himself might be ﬁif ndt for the fortunate adoption.‘

On God: “When I look at the world around me,
I find it difficult to conceive of an omnipotent, all-
good, fatherlike deity. Such a deity would not per-_
mit the pain- and suffering that exists.”

Later, “I wanted to believe. I wanted to believe;

very much. I used to pray—1ust pray for an answer,‘
a sign that I could have faith in, or for faith /it-’
self. That’s all over now.” This boy is obviously in
need of help of some kind.

ance.‘.Since these sphools have already rejected a basic'dem-
ocratic principle they might consider” adoption of. the Red
panacea.
But a much easier way is what is planned for’gPitt. Bigo-
L A ‘ try exists here as it does in all schools of our size. But since

Ever four years, but the beneﬁt is immeasurable if only the

dent body. / , ‘
If, as SCRO president Richard Mattern has said, the *‘
plan leads to a'year—round program of breaking down bar-
riers of ignorance about the wide variety of religions at Pitt,
a remarkable and ﬁne antithesis will combat the hideous‘be-
trayal the less tolerant schools are committing against, free

Letters r*T0  The . Editor

Editor, The Pitt News:

Our apologies to Murray Chass

for ever accusing him of being

a Nehru-type neutral. In his ser-
ies of articles it has become clear
that Mr. Chass owes his "ﬁnal

allegiance to his social fraternity

and the fraternity coalition, the

Allied Collegiate Party.
Of course Mr. Chass didn’t

mention that the ACS were~
totally fraternity. Neither did he ‘~

point out in his “.unbiased'sur-
vey” that it was the initiative of
the United Independent Party
‘that was primarily responsible
for the record voting. He also

forgot to comment that this was _

the best showing and complete-
ly independent party evergmade
at Pi-tt. I

Mr. Chass had us believing"

that the 6 out. of 11 positions
won by the AC’s on" S.C.A. con-
stituted an encouraging victory
for the fraternity men.

In proving this point he ob-
served that 92 more straight
ticket votes would have c'I)ped
all positions but one for the
AC’s. May I point out that only a

few more straight tickets for the_

UI’s would have meant an almost
complete wictory for this party
also. A‘ .

If Mr. Chass believes in poli-
tical trendshe should have noted

that such a victory for the inde-

pendents might easily occur nex ’

year.

(Editor’s note: Mr. Ribich’ must
stand corrected in his statement
that “a few more straight tickets
for the UPS would have meant
an almost complete victory for
this party.” In computing the
number of “if” votes, Mr. Chass
found that the UPS needed 129
more votes to win all but four
positions, 150 more for all. but
three, 240 for all but one, and

30 ‘more to win all positions.)

Editor, The Pitt News:

There seems to be an attitude 
’ among The Pitt Newsstaff that

football players are of no use to
the University except on the
football ﬁeld. Many athletes hadye

more to oﬁer than the hard work i ’

and long hours -they put into
their sport, although this in it-
self is enough.

And we should encourage‘

them to enter more activities,

whether it be politics or any’

other activity, rather than dis-
courage them by shading the
footlights when they appear.
Every person entering an ac-
tivity should be given an equal
chance and not be expected to
make up for, the failure of zines,
other. Why must‘ those who have

failed reflect upon those who

will be successful?

If failures are to. be listed, I .

would suggest you publish a list
ofbordinary students who have
not fulfilled the ‘duties of their
office, not just the ..athlete..

The average student" has more
time to devote to his office than
the athlete, naturally, because
he is notexpected to spend ﬁve
or six hours a day at practice.

But if an athlete is willing to
forfeit the ‘other eighteen hours
to an activity rather than, join-
ing the Tuck Shop sitters, he, in
my opinion, deserves praise, not
prosecution. "

Panthers Travel North 'BuSy Weekend

Veterans Bolster Squad

By JIM LACEY

Allegheny College will provide the opposition tomorrow
when the Panther Mittmen travel to Meadville for an early

afternoon contest.
V Last year the Gators had a-r4-7 record, with one of the
losses coming at the hands of the Blue and.Go1d by a 7-0

count. The current Allegheny team has nine lettermen, one
at each position.

Dal Matthews, returns at sec-
ond, after leading the team in
batting with a .324 average. Bob
Lowing, the; Gators second best,
hitter with a .321, will be in one
of the outﬁeld slots.

Short on Pitchers

Jim Dronsﬁeld will handle the
catching. Although he hit only
.238, he was the runs-batted-in
leader with 12.

The only department where
Coach Jack Garback may have
trouble is the pitching. After
letterman, Jack Keppel, Gar-
back will have to go with Soph-
omores, Jim George and Frank
Maldonado. -

‘After the first week of play,
Coach Bob Lewis has found three
reliable starters and possibly a
fourth. Bill‘ Hamilton, 4-1 last
year, will be the bell-wether of
the staff. Hamilton pitched three
hit ball against Indiana State
Teachers College during a seven
inning stint. In the season opener.

Gilmore Aids Staff

John Reichenbach, 1-1 last year,

received credit for the victory

against Indiana by pitching three Bin Hamiuon
hitless frames. John Miriabelli, Ace panther Hurler
another 1-1 ‘record last year, will ————————__.____.__________

be the third man in the rotation
of Coach Lewis. Dick Wirth, im-
pressive as a Freshman with a
4-0 slate, will be given a chance
to show his wares as a varsity per-
former. 0
Bob Conti, Joe Daley and Bill
Gilmore are other right handers
on the staff. Ron D’Amico and
Bob Shearer will provide port-
side help. ’
“With the pitching we will stand
or fall,” said Coach Lewis, “since
the rest of the team is almost set.”

“Little Men" Find

‘*1

By ED KOLTISKA
Sports Editor it
‘Big time athletics at the University of Pittsburgh has be-
come more pronounced through the efforts of the “little men”
of Pitt.vWhen you first thought of athletics, you naturally pic-
tured the big, heavy players who usually participate in sports.

-But,‘the ‘trend at Pitt has been ‘reversed. -

. During the past two years, the Panther‘ squads have been.
making a name for themselves in the world of sports, and in
'doing‘so, the “little men” have hit the limelight.

«» Three of these players have gained national attention
as well as local recognition. Don Hennon, Paul’ Powell, and
Tom Darling are this year’s crop of outstanding “little
men”. 3 l * ‘

iEven more surprising is the fact that only one, Hennon,
of the three has had outstanding success in, his sport while in
high school. The other two were fair performers in high school
competition but did not really develop untilthey began com-

, apeting on a collegiate level. '

Hennon can almost be called «Mr. Basketball himself. His
180 pound, 5-81/3 frame is really a novelty in the big Univers-
ity basketball field. Although considered a midget among his
tall team mates and competitors, Hennon has proven his worth
many a time not only in college but also in’high school.
While in high school, he led his Wampum, Pa. team to
the Class “B” State Basketball Championship Crown as
well as capturing the individual career scoring trophy right
from under the nose of Wilt (the stilt) Chamberlain who
was performing at the same time and looks twice the size
of Hennon.
During his three years at Pitt, Hennon has broken nearly
every Field House record inlthe books. Not only has he broken

‘records, but has led the team to two NCAA Tournament Bids,

something that the Jungle Cats have not had for 16 years.
In performing these feats, Hennon has been selected to
everybody’s All-American team. The Associated Press, United

_ Press, Look, and Helms Foundation have honored the Wam-

pum Flash in their selections. Sports Illustrated and Life Mag-
azine have both publicized his achievements as well as paid
tribute to his father Butler Hennon, for the ﬁne coaching job
performed at Wampum High. .
' _For the second straight year, Don was named to two
Little All-American Teams that honor hoopsters below the
height of 5-10. Recently, Hennon played the role of an actor
down in Shelbyville, Tenn., for a hoop picture. The feature

This past week, Dr. Sam Mossafer of Seattle, Wash., offer-

ed a proposal to Hennon which would enable the Panther ace
to tour Europe with a group. of College All-Stars. Don wired
his acceptance providing the athletic department would give
approval to make sure his amateur standing would not be
jeopardized.

Coaches Stress Offense
During Spring Training

By LARRY HAGGERTY
The Panthers, who normally have been a defensive team

been stressing offense during

the ﬁrst two weeks of spring drills at Ellsworth Center under
the scrutinage of their head coach, John Michelosen.

Last season the Panthers did not have uniform blocking
assignments, and because of this fact the Jungle Cats offen-

in many of the games. However,

situation in a hurry.

“This season the blocking is go-
ing to be uni- —
form or else,”
voiced Mich-
elosen and his

season found
the Blue and
Gold taking an
awful long time
in their hud-
dles, but this
was due mainly

 

Hefferle

of the players to have a thorough
understanding of the blocking for
each play.
Conditioningxlmportant

“So far this‘ spring the squad
has been practicing faithfully and
enjoying their work mainly be-
-cause of the vast change in the
offense,” stated Panther co-cap-
tains Don Crafton and Ed Mich-
aels.

Actually the main theme of
A the spring drills is physical
conditioning. The coaching staﬁ
is allowed only twenty days un-
der NCAA rules to prepare
their charges for the fall sched-
ule. The practices also must not
exceed a thirty day period.
W As ‘usual, Michelosen is using
the unit system in arranging his
squad during the drills. Instead
of calling his players the ﬁrst‘ or

sive bogged down at crucial points¢

his proteges into A, B, C, and
units. -
End Crop Heavy
“Just because a certain indivi-
dual happens to be running with
the “A”, unit, does not} necessarily
prove that he is a ﬁrst-stringer,”
commented Panther line coach,
Jack Wiley. Nevertheless most of
the spots on the A and B units are
being held down by the nineteen
returning lettermen. ‘ V
Ernie Hefferle, the Panthe
end coach, has been blessed
with a. surplus of ﬁne ends this
spring, and will no doubt have
a hard job on his hands when
he must select the top four
terminals for the annual intra-
squad game at the Stadiumon
May 10. '
Heading Hefferle’s list are re-
{turning lettermen Art Gob, Jim
;Zanos, Joe Pullekines, and Bob
Rathi. Another promising per-
former at the terminal slot’ is
Fritz Walker of Mt. Lebanon.
Stulitza Returns _
Walker, who made the a1l—state
team in his senior year in high
school, is a transfer student from

matching walking shorts
proved to them that I was a
Yank.

I needed a quick one, so I
ﬂoated into a tank joint in my
Van Heusen leisure coordi-
nates and’ ordered a V-8 on
the rocks. Then I saw her.

“Pepe!” she called. She
musta been talking to me-—
and I wasn’t going to knock it.

“Si, Chiquita,” and I fol-
lowed her upstairs. She kissed
me hard on the mouth. I
misunderstood.

“How about a game of
Spanish Jotto?” I asked. She
misunderstood.

I felt her ﬁngers under my
collar. “Where is it, Pepe?”

“Where’s what?”

“The microﬁlm, idiot. You
were given orders to carry the
guided missile data inside your
slotted collar.” _

THE MISMATCHED

 

Little» did Chiquita know
that my Van Heusen sport
shirt had Collarite sewn—in
stays. Nobody was going to
substitute microﬁlm for my
microthin Istays ._ . . because
my stays can’t come out . . .
even in laundering.

The door ﬂew open. A man
stood there in ﬂashy, ill—ﬁtting
yellow walk shorts with a pink
sport shirt. Except for the .
guy's scroungy leisure clothes,
he coulda been my twin.

“Get him Pepe !” said
Chiquita. ’

He jumped mé——and in the

ensuing struggle, I stabbed
him with his own collar stay.
I turned Chiquita over to the
authorities and Pepe was given
a decent burial in Van Heusen
matching sport shirt and
slacks. The microﬁlm was re-
covered, the plans saved—-
and we owe it all to Van
Heusen. Why not show your
patriotism by wearing Van
Heusen leisure slacks, sport
shirts, walking shorts, and
swimwear. r

‘Reports Chances
For Summer ‘Jobs

The New York State Employ-
ment Service reports that sum-

-mer job opportunities for camp

counselors are excellent.

Muriel Sobel, head of the Em-
ployment Services Camp Unit in
New York City, ascribes the in-
creasing popularity of these camp
positions ﬁrst to good salaries.

Jobs for general counselors pay V.

from $160 to $400 a season plus
free transportation and room and
board at resident camps. '
Qualiﬁcations for these jobs
are at least‘ one semester of
college, current day school at-
tendance, and some group lead-
ership experience, either paid
or voluntary.
Openings are in camps through-
out North Atlantic States. Stu-

dents can usually pick the 1oca- W3,
tion and the kind of camp ind

which they wish to Work. .
"Miss Sobel urges»
students to request applications

immediately, or to arrange a per- ‘

sonal interview at the Camp Unit
of the State Employrnent Serv-
ice, ll9 Fifth Avenue, New York
City.

hopes to play more selections
by Bach. One ambitionshe has
is to give a concert in Stephen
Foster Memorial. ~

Linda believes that one is some-
times not justified in comparing
music compositions. “Because the
success of a certain selection de-
pends not only on the composer
but also on the period in which
it was written,  is hard to make
comparisons.” *

Linda’s reason for coming to
Pitt isbnot to receive a degree but
to broaden her educational back-
ground at the University. She is
a sophomore and is Concentrating
on liberal arts courses.

sible through a million dollar
grant fro1;n~ the Ford Foundation

method” of instruction and gath-
ering activity throughout the bus-
iness schools of the country.

Participants in the program

being taught by means of the
case method at the Harvard

Business School and will also

make field trips. ’

AIA participants will devel-
’op at least one case which they
will then teach to other mem-
