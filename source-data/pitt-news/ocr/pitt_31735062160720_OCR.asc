Adds Three Planks

By MURRAY CHASS

Richard Mattern and John

Strauch are the United Inde-

pendent candidates for president and vice president of SGA.
At the same time the UI slate was released, it was also

announced that three “specific

” planks have been added to

the party’s original three-point platform.
The slate, as given by the Independents, is incomplete.

Mattern and Stranch are both ¢
currently in Student Congress
holding the positions of Assem-
blies Chairman and Social
Chairman, respectively. They
will oppose Bert O’Malley and
Mark Elovitz of the Allied Col-
legiate Party in the Ma.. 26
elections. ~

Here is the remainder of U1
slate for SGA:

Senior positions: Russ Maxwell,
Gregory Morris, Ann Papieski;
Junior positions: Tom Ribich,
David ‘Breakstone, Diane Kasnic;
Sophomore positions: W o o d y
Turner, William Hoffman, Lois
Capin.

For MC the party has backed
Jim Pomarico for president, Bill
Kaliden for vice president, and
Michael Altman for secretary.

The additions to the platform
are: (1) active pursuance for
improved student park? lg facil-
ities; (2) support of co-operative
faculty evaluations; and (3) in-
vestigation into the mysteries
of the University food service.

Concerning the UPS top SGA
hopefuls, a party spokesman said:
“Dick Mattern is unquestionably
the most dynamic individual in
this year’s Student Congress. His
coordination of the Assemblies
Committee and his constructive
leadersliip in a -body notable for its
inactivity are positive examples
of outstanding ability”.

“The student body is well aware
of Mattern’s singular contribution

one else as his peer in student.

vious error.”

“John Strauch has worked‘ ef-
fectively with Mattern on SC. His
record was the most outstanding of
any Congress sophomore. In addi-
tion, he views government as an
integrated whole, not as a “mass of
intricasies."-

incorporate classes into its

structure as councils parallel
the Freshman

to present

5 Council.

Currently, the women’s classes
are autonomous organizations with
their own appropriations, pro-
grams, oﬂicers and by-laws.

Each class will elect its own
chairman, vice-chairman, sec-
retary, treasurer and advisors.
Chairmen will be members of
 Executive Committee and
Ciimmission, and councils will
receive t h e i r appropriations

through AWS.

At present an oﬁicer is elected
with the speciﬁc title of class rep-
resentative to AWS.

According to President Chris
Taylor, Col. ’58, the by-laws will
not be‘ changed because this pro-
gram will be carried out experi-
mentally until a decision on trime-
‘stersvis made. She explained that if

they are instituted, further revi-
sions would be necessary.

Gladys Flesher, Ed. '58, Chief
stated’

Justice of Senior Court,
that the new plan will strengthen‘
both the councils and AWS.

It will change the name of the:

Center to Johnstown College of
the University‘ of Pittsburgh; it
will provide for the institution to
be headed by a president, report-
ing directly to the Chancellor of
the University, with responsibili-
ties for educational leadership,

The third change will be the

. creation of an advisory council

of leading citizens of the Johns-

guidance and to help mobolize
continuing community support
for the institution. T h e s e
changes are effective July 1.
J ohnstown College will continue
for the present to offer the first
two years of college work as it has

challenging opportunity for the
community to continue this inter-
est and support.

“The whole new program itself,”

he said, “is an outgrowth and
recognition of thisinterest which
the Johnstown area has shown.”

More than 600 students are
currently enrolled at Johnstown
Center which offers both a day
and evening program for under-
graduate and non-degree part-

  Bookstore   Economy

Student Discount Program is a welcome service to eco-
nomical students at the University of Pittsburgh. V _
_It would appear-from the lack of interest shown for

the prograrn that few student_s are concerned about saving
‘money. The discount service entitles the bearer of a card

which can be picked up atothe Student Desk to a ten per
cent discount at many local ﬁrms. 

In spite of the disinterest in the discounts from local
ﬁrms, many-students complain about the full retail prices
at the University Bookstore. -

With the announcement to ‘tenants of the Ruskin Apart- -
_ ments that a" new community bookstore will be opened by

the ‘University, students wonder justifiably whether the
same prices will apply to them as apply to the general
public. _
The mark-up on many of the texts permits a university-
run bookstore ‘to give the students at least a token discount
when they will be such a captive market. ‘
The University should recognize" this inherent obliga-
tion to students while assuming the role of community ben-
efactor ‘and providing the public with rare and ‘ unusual
volumes. _ i .
Another defect of the present bookstore which might be
eliminated include terribly slow service in procuring books

- not presently in stock.

A glaring example of mismanagement which occurred

' this semester was the return of a shipment of books to the

publisher while students who needed them burned.
. Often by the time the bookstore gets the books the stu-
dents no longer need them. 1 _, 
A university bookstore, it would seem, should not re-

quire for itself exhorbitant proﬁts on used books. Yet anyone I
I who has sold books in the University Bookstore is‘ acutely

aware that such a situation exists here. . -

And when the same student attempts to buy a book
which is as old or older then the one he has just sold it is
little wonder that he complains about the difference in
price. .

Students should, however, if they are thrifty take ad-
vantage of one money saving program, that of Student
Discount. C

Workers Get The Shaft: While...

Cheaters Get The Grades

By Donna Considine

The oft uttered expression that a person who
cheats hurts only himself is a misconception of the
realities of this widespread problem.

What is more important is that the classroom
cheater hurts his fellow students and the college
or university which he attends.

Dr. Philip Jacob has stated in
his book Changing Values In
College, that although collegians
respect “moral virtues such as
sincerity, honesty and loyalty,
systematic cheating is a common
practice rather than the excep-
tion at many major institutions.” *

It is questionable, however,
whether most of the cheating is
“systematic,” for some may cheat
occasionally out of desperation. Students at the
lower end of the grade scale save themselves from
failing the ﬁnal. Others cheat to retain higher
grades and the prestige that accompanies them.

Thus they justify their actions by rationalizing.
These students will never regret “cribbing.” They
aren’t hurting themselves unless caught. Even then
penalties are not always inﬂicted.

Where cheating is known to occur in the class,
morale falls to a low level among non-cheaters be-
cause they can do little to curb the situation. They
can not compete with answers taken directly from
the book. "-

 

Eizistence of the problem on various campuses is .

bad enough, but when general student attitude is
one of “tolerance” and‘ individuals boast openly of
having cheated in ﬁnals, the situation becomes in—,
tolerable. -

SGA Sees Need

Unfortunately such cases exist at the University.
Most students dismiss the problem as being inevi-
table for such_a large institution. Therefore social
pressure against the culprit is nil. However, the
constitution of the Student Government Association
recognizes the need for a solution.
The feasibility of an honor system at Pitt has

This may sound surprisingly like .a University

month programs have failed in Nashville, Omaha,
Newark, Amarillo, and Alliquippa.

The parallelisms between the advantages and dis-
advantages of this program and the trimester are
striking. One advantage is, overloaded system could
increase by 1,5 the number of students.

 

Teachers working twelve months with two weeks A»

vacation instead often would havet20%» salary in-
crease.‘They might. well complain, ..I might add, as
have Pitt professors, that althoughicheir salaries are
increased by 1/ 5, their work is increased  17-4.
Pitt faculty salaries for teaching third trimester are
increased by 1/4, their work by 1/$3. , ‘.
Students who were out of school due to illness
would have to make up only -, one quarter (3
months) instead of one semester. ‘

Disadvantages Appear _ , __
With three-quarters of student,-body in school at '

been discussed and debated among University
groups withbut result for the past few years. The
consensus of opinion has been that such a program
would be impossible here. Thus plans have gone
no further. ,
The main stumbling block is the student body
in whose hands the honor code lies. College students

 

who have studied under such a system accept, it V

without question. They can not understand the
furor which the question raises at larger institutions
such as Pitt.

Some assert that one solution to cheating would
be found-in the abolition of the grading system.
They claim that students would have little reason to
cheat.

This might be the solution in an ideal intellectual
atmosphere where students are motivated to learn

/for the sake of knowledge. There are few too few‘

students and too few colleges of this type to put
this idea into general effect.
Faculty Blamed
Others blame the professors partially for cheat-
ing because of “tricky” tests which measure alert-
ness rather than absorption of course material. In
some departments. tests have been given which did
not change in content from year to year. Fortu-
nately, this will be remedied here. A
Another instan”ce of faculty blame is that some
professors insist upon set answers for essay ques_-
tions rather than accepting the student’s interpre-

tation based on fundamentals learned in class. Such A

a policy tempts studentsto copy from those seated
near them. » I '
Perhaps the only answer is to lay aside the whys
and wherefores of cheating and strongly-condemn
the individual cheater. ' ' -

Even if proctors ‘must be doubled or tripled in ‘

each class testwith extreme penalties for violators,
cheating will have to be decreased at the University
of Pittsburgh. “ ' ;
For the best measure of a university is the class-
room education of its students. and if its best stu-
dents are hindered by cheaters, so also is theuni-i
versity. ‘ . C"

any onetime, older students could be placed in jobs

more easily for vacation. Or so they thought.
Then the disadvantages ‘began cropping up. The

first problem, was curricular. With new classes

starting’ every quarter, at least three sections would T

have to be taught in each subject (only feasible for
very large institutions). _ ’  ‘ ,

Repairs would have to be carried out while school
was in session. Teachers would have better income,
but the same problem of fatigue" that appears with
the trimester program is probable -with the high-
school quarter system. .

According to Time, teachers would have "no time
to recuperate from a year’s seige of youngsters 0
to take professional courses.” , '

Four separate graduations and commencements
would be required. Transfers would be hopelessly
complicated. Vacation quarters would have to be
assigned arbitrarily,” Time said.

  Sports Will Suffer

Under the proposed trimester program, students
could select their own vacation period, the article"
said, but if the large bulk of students (as is likely)
should select the summer or spring quarter (what-
ever you want to call it), arbitrary assignments
would be inevitable to the success of the “show.”

According to Time, “Coaches would swallow their
whistles in rage when hot-shot halfbacks were told
to take the fall months off.” (Hmmm.)

Students have rebelled . at taking out—of-season
vacations‘ at these schools. Others have “breezed
through’.’»,,without a stop and ﬁnished too-young. to
work and too immature to gain admission to college.

An analogy could be drawn in the latter point to
students ﬁnishing college too young for graduate
school, too immature for a responsible position.

Degree (lonsclous
By IVIILLARD ANIDUR

_ Dr. Herbert Howarth, of
Oxford, visiting assistant pro-
fessor of English, is a traveler
and authority on American-
English literary criticism.’

A former director of the
British Book League, he helped
arrange book exhibitions for the
Festival of Britain and edited the
monthly magazine of the League,
Books.

As director, he was also respon-
sible for organizing lectures and
lecture tours for authors in Britain.

S Teaches Summer Course Herc

Howarth first came to the Uni-

versity of Pittsburgh in the sum-
mer of 1956 when he taught
courses in Modern and Rennais-

ance literature in the summer ses— i

sion. ‘

He has taught at various other
American universities including
University of Michigan (sum-
mer session, 1955), University
of Montana (1956-57 school
year), i -and the University of
Minnesota (summers of 1957).

The well-travelled Englishman
also took a short lecture tour of
‘Paciﬁc Coast Universities in early
1957. Howarth spent his under-
graduate years at Oxford Univer-
sity where he concentrated upon
the classes and English literature.

Serves in tMiddle East

During the second World War,
he served as Information Officer
for the British Government in the

.Middle East. At this time, he took

the. opportunity to study Arabic
at the School of_ Oriental Studies.
of American University, Cairo.
He also found time to absorb a
bit of Hebrew while in the Holy

«Land.

Howard: ‘is teaching courses
at Pitt now in Shakespeare and
sophomore English. He has 1
great interest in this University
which is, in his words, “mak-
ing big strides forward.” He is
impressed by the “imagination
being brought to bear on the
various educational problems
here."

It gives one a »‘‘satisfactory feel-
ing.” He believes that this Uni.-
versity is giving its faculty the

Dr. Herbert Howarth of Oxford

 

A few outstanding people in every class

iment. The “unstatic” situation al-
lows for sympathetic hearings for
the teachers and very often ap-
propriate action.

He has found at Pitt a very high
quality of men and women who at
the sophomore stage “can’t see, in
many cases, how they can best
develop but_,in their last two years
usually develop splendidly.”

standouts Noticeable

i There are always a few “out-
standing people” noticeable in ev-
ery class from the outset, and
“worthy attributes are found in
many of the others after you get
to know them.”

Howarth has had several ar-
ticles printed and is at present
in the final stages of writing:
book on the Anglo-Irish writers
1809-1940 (LITERATURE UN-
DER PARNELUS STAR).

His most recent article appears
in the ’March issue of Harper’s
Magazine, in which ‘he recounts
impressions and opinions develop-
ed during his stay in Montana.

Title of this afticle is Montana:

twre, Fall,

the Frontier uzent Thamway. He
published in Comparative Litera-
1957, an essay on
“Eliot Beethoven, and J. W. N.
Sullivan.” This is a rather com-
prehensive comparison of Eliot’s
themes to a Beethoven opus.

In the summer, 1957 edition of
Comparative Literature, Howarth
contributed an article on “Joyce
and Sbapespeare.” An earlier
work was a book of translations
from the Arabic published in 1944.

Cites Work Load

The writer—tcacher expresses
the view that some students carry
“too heavy a load of courses,”
very often coupled with work
obligations, and “can’t do justice
to their school work.”

Howarth was extremely com-
plimentary about the librarian’s
role at Pitt stating: “For the
subjects I am working on, I can
normally find the necessary
books. When I cannot, the very
cﬂicient librarians can obtaina
book for me very quickly
through the Inter-Library Sys-

tem.” .

A possible criticism of the
American set of values is the “too-
high valuation set on a degree.”
Certain students who are not col-
lege material “would be much
happier and more productive out-
side a University.”

Our system of higher education
is “less rigid” than the English
counterpart in that many enter
colleges and universities here
many years, after their graduation
from secondary school. In Eng-
land, it a student does enter at the
normal age, he probably won’t
enter at all.

In England, Howarth claims,
“It’s very difficult for the student
to work his way through school."
It is very rarely done.

English System Has Defect

Hoopster Concludes
Outstanding Career

BY JANICE KLEIN ’

Any school in the country would be proud to have Julius
Pegues in its ranks. As a basketball player and as a human-
being he is the kind of person of which Pitt can be proud.

Although Pegues is often overshadowed by Don Hennon,
he has proved himself an: outstanding ball player. He is an
all around player who can not be overlooked as a high scorer.

He usually scores in the two col-9

umn. ﬁgures for the, Panthers.

' Jules hit the mark for 32 points
against St.”Louis and Geneva, and
27 points against Holy Cross. In
the NCAA against Miami, Jules
scored 31 points for a losing cause.
Coach Bob Timmdns realized his
good work often goes unnoticed,
and he has tagged him as “the
most under-rated, player on the

_ team."

Carnegie Tech Bound

Along with being an all-round
good player Pegues is a colorful
performer. His mannerisms on
the court are interesting and often
amusing to watch. »He seems to
have almost perfect coordination
at all times. His peculiar actions
at the foul line mystify many a

fan, but his method works, for he i

has landed most of his foul shots.

Pitt is lucky to have the serv-
ices of this versatile young man,
for it was recently made known
that he actually paid his en-
trance fee at Carnegie Tech.
Then fate stepped in—it was
found that Pegues lacked cer-
tain credits so he went to a prep
school in Detroit for a year to
make them up. Then, when Tech
was ready to take him, he ’
changed his. mind and enrolled
at Pitt.

One of the reasons Tech was in-
terested in Jules was his excellent
football potential. It seems he was
known for his high school quar-

terbacking in Tulsa, Oklahoma. ‘

Football still remains one of his
favorite sports, but he doesn’t

comprehensive exam after 3 years
of study, “cram all the work into
their last year.”

Our system demands a “much-
more equalized division.” with
semester examinations.

The Oxford system was

while a student is int school,
little studying should be done,
but instead a student runs the
full gamut of cultural activities.

“The study-and reading is nor-I

 

\

mally accomplished on the six-
month vacations.” The student’s
View is broadened during school
time by discussions with other
students and faculty, the interplay
of ideas, through dramatics, de-
bating, etc.

“Perhaps,” he concedes, “this is
carried on at Oxford to an exag-
gerated extent.”

Trimester Presents Problem
The trimester, Howarth be-
lieves, does present a “grave prob-
lem.” It puts ‘very great pressure
on the faculty and students as to
whether_or not they should select

 

 

the program.

“Fatigue and lower quality of
work might result if the teacher
or student elects the trimester
program.”

The trimester plan can be
very valuable if the counselors
advise students who can afford
not to go the three trimesters
to think, travel, read during at
leastone trimester in two years.
Meditation is very valuable.”

As to Howarth’s plans for the
near future, this summer he will
teach at the Bread Loaf School
and next September return to Pitt.
