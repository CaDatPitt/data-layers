etirement Bill Will Affect Tenure

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

Proposed legislation that would
eliminate the mandatory retire-
ment age for faculty is being pro-
tested by Pitt chancellor Wesley
Posvar and others because they say
it will have an adverse effect on
tenure.

The newly-proposed legislation,
one piece of which was proposed
by Senator John Heinz of Pennsyl-
vania, will allow members of the
university faculty to continue
working past 70.This will result in

fewer job openings for young peo-
ple seeking a teaching position.

The most current legislation on
"the subject, which expired last
June, also called for the elimina-
tion of a mandatory retirement age,
but exempted universities. Pitt cur-
rently has a mandatory retirement
age of 70.

While the University of Pitts-
burgh is always looking for young
people with the latest knowledge,
“the removal of the age exemption
would work against this process,”
according to Lou Tronzo, assistant
vice-chancellor for public affairs.

ti’

The academic profession in

general is opposed to this," said '

dean Jerome Rosenberg of the Col-

- lege of Arts and Sciences. “It would

just be devastating for young peo-
ple who are trying to enter the
profession."

Elimination of a mandatory age
for retirement will remove the Uni-
versity’s “orderly way of moving
people out and new people in."
Rosenberg said. *

“I think it would be very harm-
ful,” he said.

Posvar is protesting this legisla-
tion by visiting various lawmakers,

 

Despite the prolonged stretch of nice weather, the signs that indicate it’s nearly I

Campus Crime Watch Formed

By LAURIE MocLEOD

The Department of Public Safety
and the Resident Student-As‘socia-
tion (RSA) are forming a “campus
watch” to prevent crime because of
the department’s decreased budget
and limited manpower.

Crime prevention has existed on
an informal level because of reduc-
tions in police manpower. “It’s
time to formalize the concept,” said
Sgt. Charles Grier, from the depart-
ment; who was the speaker at
RSA’s Security Awareness meeting
Monday.

Grier, who said that not all cam-
pus. crimes are being officially
reported, explained that the pur-
pose of the program is to encourage
communication between students
and the campus police.

“Students will be encouraged to
observe and report suspicious
activity but let the department
define criminal activity," he said.

Grier said this type of interaction
and attitude will discourage the
criminal element.

The program w-ill consist of a
student orientation by police con-
cerning what constitutes suspi-
cious activity, what an individual’s
role in the community is and how
to assist each other in preventing
crime. __ _

The proposed training program
will include the assignment of stu-
dents to beat patrols and placement
in police patrol cars, both ways of
observing the campus. “This pro-
gram can be an ongoing police
orientation," Grier said. ‘

“A formalized campus watch
should diminish real crime and the
psychology of fear that exists where
there is. crime,” he said.

“Campus Watch" will be imple-
mented by the RSA security safety
committee, which is in the process
of cultivating its low membership,
according to RSA security safety
chairman Frank Louvis.

An informal campus watch,
stemming from the concept of the
neighborhood watch, was imple-
mented in 1976 by a community
relations committee of the Depart-
ment of Public Safety, according to
Grier. /

He said the neighborhood watch
began across the country because of
a crime wave in 1973 and dimin-
ished police budgets and
manpower.

including congressman Doug
Walgren, to discuss the issue.

“We've been down visiting some
of‘ the congressmen and chatting
with them about this to see if we
can _get university members
exempt,” Tronzo said.

Although Tronzo acknowledges
that Posvar’s efforts have made
some headway, he said there is no
way of knowing how much until
the congress comes back from
recess.

The new congress will be con-
vened after Jan. 1,1983.

“We’re going to keep working
on it,” Tronzo said.

Advising -
Center
Reduced

Must Make  
Changes

By RAY»WU$L|CH

Budget cuts are forcing the Col-
lege of. Arts and Sciences advising
center to change the way it will
advise students during Winter
Term, College of Arts and Sciences

dean Irwin Schulman told the CAS

council Monday.

The advisers, who are graduate
students, had been assigned to
counsel between 100 and 110 stu-
dents each on registration and
choosing majors. Schulman said
that for Winter Term, the number
of advisers in the center will be
reduced from  to 28. In addition,
sophomores will be counselled in
groups instead of individually,
Schulman said.

Because of the reduction, stu-
dents are being encouraged to
declare their majors after complet-
ing 48 credits, rather than 55 as in
the past, Schulman said.

Counselors for the 250 Univer-
sity Community-Education Pro-
gram (UCEP) students will also
_serve as advisers for students in that
program, and faculty members will
advise students in the Liberal Stu-
dies programs, Schulman said.

“These measures will enable us
to live within the budget,” Schul-
man said. I

The Council also approved the
elimination of the rule governing
the CAS Business dual major
which had stipulated that no more
than 30 credits in a student’s CAS
major could be counted toward his
bachelor’s degree.

The rule, which had been in
effect for the past
“placed an undue burden upon
students and could require them to
stay more than four years,” Schul-
man said.

He also reported that this year's
application rate for admission to

Pitt is three percent higher than
last year's. The freshman class,
which has over 1,900 students, is
one of the biggest ever, Schulman
said. The trend is expected to con-
tinue until the late 1980's because
of the widening gap between the

Pitt Expanding Computer Use   

By COLLETTE FERRIS

Pitt is expanding its use of
computers, although not on the
same scale as Carnegie-Mellon
University, which recently
announced its plans to assign
personal computers to students.

Dr. Paul Steinman, director
of the University Computer
Center, said that the center and
the Graduate School of Busi-
ness are working on a program
that would allow 250 business
students the personal use of 12
computers for a term.

CA‘.-S Dean Schiilman

Steinman said, however, that
it is unlikely that Pitt would be
able to assign computers to stu-
dents on a one-to-one basis

 

because Pitt’s student popula- \

tion is so large. In addition, the
cost of an individualized com-
puter system would be too high,
Steinman said.

Carnegie-Mellon students
will be charged approximately
$750 per term for their co’mpu-
ters. The computers will be the
students’ personal property.

Pitt, which has approxi-
mately 500 computer terminals
distributed throughout the
campus, experiences a “term

crunch” when students attempt
to use the terminals between 10
a.m. and 2 p.m., Steinman said.
He added, however, that Pitt
has facilities open 24 hours a
day, so many do get on the com-
puters during the “off” hours.
Steinman added that the cen-
ter is exploring the possibility
of establishing another termi-
nal site closer to the residence
hallls. Computer sites are cur-
rently located in the Cathedral,
Benedum Hall, Old Engineer-

ing Hall, the Library and Infor-
mation Science Building,
Forbes Quadrangle and
Alumni Hall.

Pitt now charges no fees for
computer use, Steinman said,
and added that he foresees per-
sonal use of computers at
colleges.

“It is very realistic that, in the
near future, more and more
people will be bringing their
own computers to schools such
as Pitt,” Steinman said.

r*»Pitt Engineers, Army Corp Join Forces

By LYNNE LACEY

Pitt engineering students
have joined forces with the U.S.
Army Corp of Engineers in var-
ious programs designed to pro-

valuable work experience in
their chosen professional fields.

Cooperative education is one

of serendipity," Abrams said.
The initiation of Pitt's co-op
program with the corps can be
attributed to Abram's 15-year
relationship with the Pitts-
burgh district of the Corps, dur-
ing which he presented
seminars on the use of comput-
ers in civil engineering as a part

senior co-op student from Pitt.
“All of the engineers should do
this."

That is one reason why
Abrams participates in the co-
op program. “Our undergradu-
ate students spend four years in

opinions held by the public that
are derived from the press," he
said.

Through applications and
interviews, these students were
chosen to participate in the Pitt

By MICHAEL ROKNICK

The town of Midland stands
silently beside the now retired
Crucible Steel Plant. The mill
was officially closed on Oct. 15

.by its parent company, Colt

Industries.

The people of the town have
been discussing the possibility
of the closing down of the mill
some day; Colt Industries

announced that it would close
the mill unless a buyer was
found. Colt was unable to
negotiate a deal with a prospec-
tive buyer, so the company
decided to close the mill.

The local Catholic church
has become deeply involved in
trying to find a solution to the
Crucible problem. Its pastor,
Father Edward Hoffmann, is
the burly man who presides
over Presentation Church.

He is presently trying to find
a way to get Crucible back into
production. He feels at home in
Midland and has started a good
dialogue between himself and

the members of the community..

In his office, the 46-year old
priest sits behind a desk covered
with paper, most of which is
mail. Two cigars lie noticeably
at the end of his desk; they are
thicker and longer than most,
meant only for display. There is
also a hand painted sign on his
desk, showing his pride in his
heritage.

Hoffman enters his office
and sits behind his cluttered
desk. He drags heavily on the
stump of a cigar. His lightly-
colored hair rests softly on his
forehead, and with his deter-
mined look, he closely resem-
bles a young ()rson Wells.

Hoffmann begins the conver-
sation by explaining that he
has been on vacation, and apol-
ogizing for the conditions of his
office. He begins to talk can-
didly about Midland and his
feelings about the situation.

A few of his parishioners

have moved to find employ-
ment, but this situation has not

yet affected the enrollment of

the parish school which now
stands at 150. He talks about
what the church has been doing
in the community in both a
spiritual and an economic
sense.

“We had a prayer service that
was attended by 350 people,”
Hoffman said. “The theme was
to get the community united in
prayer to ask the Lord's bless-
ing. It was an interdenomina-'
tional event that drew a lot
more people than most thought

> s ;it would. That was on July 18.
’. , On July 19, it was announced

that the union had come to an
agreement with a prospective

buyer of the plant, Cyclops
“Steel.”

On July 20, Crucible
announced that it had broken

WI off negotiations with Cyclops.

It was at this point that Hoff-
mann decided to take action; he

 wrote to the chairman of Colt’

Industries and asked him to
come to a town meeting.
Hoffmann wanted an expla-
in the
wanted to

letter.
As he talks of his anger

Colt Industries, his

'  cheeks become flushed.

“I was distressed that Colt

 Industries didn't have enough

the community. I personally
think they have treated people

, . without any respect of human
 co‘1iip;1ssron; The anger-tthat'I

have for them isn’t for what
they are doing, it’s the way
they’re going about it.”

Although there are many
problems facing Midlan, Hoff-
mann is optimistic that some-
thing can be done to help
alleviate them.

“I havn’t noticed apathy
within the community,” Hoff-
mann said, “but there is a feel-
ing of helplessness.”

In a recent move, Hoff-
mann’s church council voted to
to make a request to the diocese
for a loan to help the area’s
unemployed. Presentation
Church would be responsible
for repaying the loan, and the
diocese would be the
underwriter.

Auxiliary Bishop Anthony
Bosco responded that the idea
had been brought before the
Diocesan Consultors’ meeting
and turned it down.

“While there was great sym-
pathy expressed by the consul-
tors for the plight of your
parishioners, they felt that no
parish could reasonably be
expected to establish such
funds and to make loans or
grants for such purposes. The
consultors felt this would open
a bottomless pit, and there
would be no way knowing
where such assistance would
end,” Bosco said in his letter of
response.

“The consultors saw the role
of the parish more as interven-
ing in crisis and assisting with
food and the like. Parishes can-
not go into the ‘lending busi-
ness.’ Permission therefore, was
not granted,” the letter
continued.

Hoffmann admits that he can
see why the diocese had to
refuse the loan, but wishes that
the outcome had been different.
At this point, Hoffmann leans
forward in his chair and looks
at the papers on the desk in
front of him. He takes his cigar
and slowly grinds out the last
embers in the ashtray on the
desk. His voice becomes
slightly softer, but the stress is
still evident in his words.

“I do believe in the ultimate.
We will have a ton of problems
if things don’t change soon. We
have received positive help
from the people of the parish—
especially from people who are
of the grandparent age. They
are helping out tremendously
in a very beautiful aspect."

He then tells the story of a
member of his_ parish—an
unemployed steel worker. The
man and his family are going to
have a yard sale to raise money
to help pay their bills. The fam-
ily. though f-in-anc~ia,lly&

strapped, is donating clothes to
the Unemployed Steel Fund.

“It’s unbelievable what some
people are doing to help the
unemployed,” Hoffmann said.

The main interest of the peo-
ple of Midland has been what is
being done to solve the town's
problems. Most of the problems
and proposed solutions have
been discussed publicly. But
the great pastime of rnany- is
talking about the latest rumors
of what may be done. Hoff-
mann hears many of these rum-
ors and wonders if there is any
chance that they might be true.

“There are a lot. of rumors
going around. I, honest to God,
don’t know what will happen. I
believe there will be some coin-
pany that will buy Crucible and
produce steel, but I am not sure
when or who that company
will be.”

Hoffmann’s church is the
largest in town, with a congre-
gation of 3,200 people. He
believes his congregation has
been and will continue to be a
leading force in finding the
answers to the problems. At
every mass, there is a special
prayer for the community.

The priest realizes that there
is a chance that Crucible may
never be sold. He readily admits
that, even if the plant is sold, it
will never maintain the
employment level it once did.
He hopes the plant will employ
at least in the 2,000 range if it is
re-opened. In the event that the
plant isn’t sold, plans are being
formulated to make an indus-
trial park of the area.

“We don’t have anything to
go towards in this country as far
as new industry goes. If the
local people have the guts and
ability to look towards an
industrial park, I think we
could make it work. But it
could be up to 10 years before

‘that becomes a reality, and the

problem is, what do you do
until then? In any event, an
industrial park would be better
than nothing." —

In his prayers, Hoffmann
asks God to give the people of
the area the strength to deal
with their problems. He also
asks God to open the hearts of
those who are not among the
unemployed. He feels that in
the end, God will know the best
way to the solution. Hoffmann
is comforted by the fact that
God has not let him down yet,
and he has no reason to believe
that he will do so now.

When asked why he has
involved himself so deeply in
the problems of his commun-
ity, Hoffmann replied,
“Because I give a damn.”

Race

The Cold War is entering a new phase.

The arms race on Earth is not enough and
space could become its new arena. The idea of
space battle stations protected by laser beams
and accompanied by warrior aircraft may
sound far-fetched, but it isn’t.

Recently, Edward Teller, physicist and father
of the hydrogen bomb went to the White House
with a new weapon in mind. The device could
be launched into space on a moment’s notice.
Its core would be a nuclear" bomb. If the
U.S.S.R. ever launched a missile attack against
the U.S., the bomb would explode and the lasers
would destroy missiles in flight and a nice,
clean, war would be fought.

The scientific community doubts the wea-
pon’s feasibility, but just the fact that the great
space war is being discussed says something.
The race in space, that carry-over from the late
’60’s is gaining a whole new meaning.

Both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. are trying to
develop laser weapons. Both sides are using
satellites for defense purposes, and both are
intensely interested in anti-satellite weapons as
well. Such developments have put foreign pol-
icy experts on edge. It doesn’t look as if an arms
race in space can be prevented.

It is clear that the emphasis in the space race
is shifting’ -from exploratory endeavors and
knuckling under to thepressures of an arms
race in space.

The movement towards a greater militariza-
tion of space is not withoutcriticism and many A
people are recommending that the U.S. resume
negotiations aimed at banning space
weaponry.

With all the emphasis on a military presence
in space, the real reason behind space explora-
tion is also being ignored. The Halley’s Comet
mission was rejected by the -Reagan Adminis-
tration and had to be scrapped. Meanwhile,
Japan, the U.S.S.R. and the Europeans are
planning missions. ‘

JamesFletcher Whiteford, Pitt professor of
engineering and former NASA administrator,
said that the de-emphasis on space exploration
means a loss. “We don’t seem to be doing any-
thing exciting anymore,” he said, adding that
Americans are losing their spirit of adventure.

Priorities depend on values, and it is clear
what the predominant values are and just how
important mankind’s peaceful presence in
space is.

For A 

After reading “For What It's
Worth” in last Monday’s Pitt
News, it's obvious that The Pitt
News’ managing editor needs a
course in sarcasm and getting facts
straight.

Donnie Iris was referring to the
coeds as "wearing the pants.”
Sarcasm! If we can’t laugh at our
stereotypes, how do we expect to
change them? It’s clear to see that
you suffer from an illness that per-
meates our women libbers—
paranoia.

When the writer mentioned rock,

stars as being today's heroes and
that teenagers base their lives
according to these stars, how could
she seriously be worried about the
“youth of our country” grooving
to “I Can't Hear You?" *
We seriously doubt that many
youths are so involved in Ozzy
Osbourne, for example, that they
would bite the heads off of bats.

As for the little tidbit on The
Who, “Athena” was not written
al)out a “guy who's trying to figure

«out the feelings he has for a partic-

ular woman.” This particuar song
was written by Peter Townshend
about his former: drug addiction
which he triumphantly overcatne.

As for the writer’s erroneous dic-
tation of the line, “she’sjust a girl,
she’s a whore,” get the information
straight! The word twisted into
“whore” is actually “bomb.” Pete
referred to his drugs as a “woman"
and a “bomb,” as many people do.
Drugs have almost always been
referred to as she, so have ships and
countries. Does the writer get this

moderate, if not abstain from, drug

Get your story straight! After all,
you are the managingjeditor.

Also, get off Billy ]oel’s case. In
the first place, some women really
are as he described them in “She’s
Always A Woman.” Who’s to say
that Pat Benetar couldn’t take the
same song and replace all the
“she’s” with “he’s?” If you went by

Glandular Not Cerebral

Dear Editor:

I was disappointed but unsur-
prised to read the Neanderthal
responses to Christina Clinton’s

rock music sexism piece. One need '

not be a radical feminist to recog-
nize those responses as more glan-
dular than cerebral and far more
defensive than was called for.

As public recognition of social
injustice matures, so should the
sophistication of performers. We
no longer tolerate racial jokes or
white minstrel singers in blackface;
neither humor nor musical enter-
tainment is immune to social criti-
leading to heightened
sensitivitv. Tints, as a rock fan. I

do not fault Mick Jagger's mid-
I960s sexism——the issue had not yet
been widely identified-—but I am
disheartened when, in 1982, some
musicians (and Pitt students) still
haven't gotten the message that
sexism has outlived its welcome.

The overly-defensive responses
to Clinton's article reveal fragile
egos, misplaced priorities and
anachronistic attitudes. I applaud
the continuing efforts of Clinton
and others in uncovering these
musty relics of thought, with the
hope that. like the original Neand-
erthals, they will soon be extinct.

Paranoid Sexist

we’re sure that there are just as
many sexist songs about men as
there are about women.

When you get down to it, you
could find at least one song by
many female artists ranging from
Barbara Streisand to Donna
Summer to Janis Joplin that has
characterized men as being sex-
starved, insensitive bastards.

Songs like “Woman" by John
Lennon and “Waiting For a Girl
Like You” by Foreigner are just as
big in the Top 40 as (those by) Don-
nie Iris and The Who.

We all grew up on this rock and
roll the writer so wonderfully
called “garbage,” and we have yet
to run into a serious sexist created
by this pubescent music.

Be serious! The writer obviously
needs a real purpose (other than
contorting the meanings of songs
into major sexists remarks!)

As for us, we enjoy having our
doors opened by men, and we don’t
appreciate our rock and roll being
twisted to accommodate a para-
noid sexist.

Name-
Calling

Dear Editor:

I was disappointed with the let-
ters that appeared in The Pitt News
on Friday, Oct. 22 in response to
Christina Clinton's column of Oct.
18. None of the authors, with the
possible exception of Karl Kuhn,
seemed to get the message Clinton
tried to convey—-—the issue of sexism
in rock and roll. All of the letters
instead chose to focus on Clinton’s
factual errors and resort to name-
calling.

I find this discouraging. If one
wished to criticize the article, it
should have been a logical argu-
ment suggesting Clinton was
incorrect. Instead, all we got was a
lot of useless name-calling.

I’ve always felt that the opinion
pages of a newspaper are a forum
for discussing the issues of the day.
For tho.se pages to be used for
name—calling is sad. particularly
when those responses come from
the students of a major university.

A Shameful Substitute For Debate

Dear Editor:

Judging from the letters that
appeared on this page last Friday,
Christina Clinton’s Oct. 18 editor-
ial, “For What It Is Worth," struck
a nerve among many readers. Clin-
ton’s editorial and the responses it
provoked bear closer inspection.

Factual errors aside, Clinton’s
editorial points up what she sees as

i a significant problem: sexism in

rock music. “Sexist” music is
viewed as an outgrowth of sexism
in society. And, if I interpret Clin-
ton’s position correctly, she feels
that the music helps to propagate
and sustain sexist attitudes among
our country's youth.

I tend to disagree with Clinton’s
analysis. Conflict lies at the heart
of most great art. The conflict
between men and women is, I
think, timeless and omnipresent in
our society. If art reflects society,
it's not hard to see why this tension

appears in rock music. And, this ’

tension tends to be projected into
stereotypes.

One should note that stereotypes
pertaining to both sexes have long
existed in music. The “man who
done me wrong” that was long the

subject of torch ballads has rock,

and roll equivalents. There are
male substitutes for Hall and
Oates’ “Maneater.” Stereotypes
and sexist representations of both
sexes help to reflect, in simple
terms, the perennial conflict that
exists between men and women in
society. S

Whilecstereotypes exist for men

A Popular Choice

Dear Editor:

Occupational
finally come to the University of
Pittsburgh. The School of Health
Related Professions (HRP),
located in Pennsylvania Hall, has
added a program in occupational
therapy to its list of allied health
fields. It is a two-year program that
prepares the student to practice as a
licensed occupational therapist in
a number of health care positions
after graduation.-

Since occupational therapy is
still a growing field, there are some
misunderstanding as to what
exactly it involves. The problem
seems to stem form the word “occu-
pation” and how it is defined.
“Occupation” is used here to refer
to human activity that engages
one’-s resources such as self mainte-
nance, productivity and leisure
tasks. The purpose of occupational
therapy is to assist a person to carry
out these occupations with opti-
mum efficiency.

Occupational therapy focuses on
purposeful activity. During reha-

therapy has A

situation. As the feminist move-
ment has grown, women have been
struggling to undo years of custom
that have kept them in an inferior
role and subservient status. As
women have grown more con-

 

scious of their changing position
in society, things like sexist lyrics
become significant if only for their
symbolic value. Clinton raises per-

_tinent questions: Is sexist music

having an undesirable effect on
people's attitudes? Or is it just a
reflection of men and women's per-
petual love/hate relationship?
While the issues are debatable,
Clinton makes
more salient.

The letters that appeared in
response to Clinton’s article did
not, however, directly address the
question of sexism in music and its
effects. .Generally, /they were per-
sonal attacks on the author. Cer-
tainly, Clinton’s factual errors and

her self-description as a “big-’

bilitation, the patient is involved
in a number of activities that are
goal-directed towards developing
and maintaining his capacity to
perform tasks essential to a produc-
tive and self-satisfying life.,

The occupational therapist
works with those who are physi-
cally or emotionally impaired,
developmentally disabled and the
aged. The benefits of occupational
therapy are self-evident and
include the decrease or elimination
of the need for prolonged hospital
stay. This has made occupational
therapy one of the fastest-growing
health‘care professions, along with
a very rewarding and important
career choice. Because of this, itcan
be safelyassumed that the occupa-
tional therapy program now
offered at Pitt will become a very
competitive and popular choice
among those students who are
interested in health care.

mouth" who “wears the pants"
helped to enourage personal criti-
cism. But, there was a paucity of
discussion about the merits and
weaknesses of her thesis.

Some of theletters did contain a
germ of valid argument. Karl
Kuhn, who calls Clinton Pitt's
“foremost comedian,” raises the
question of censorship, but he
leaves it until the last line. It’s a
throwaway.

In “Column Written With
Crayon," Daniel Hall rightfully
criticizes Clinton’s factual errors.

But he ends his letter with an
attack on the author: “Stick to sub-
jects that you know about.” The
general intent of his letter was to
point out Clinton’s factual inac-
curacies. He explicitly states that
he doesn't wish to “argue feminism
or sexism.” So, why write off the
whole subject with a slap at the
author?

Peter Bonacuse's letter raises a
valid point, but it is buried in his
pseudo-satiric treatment. In his let-
ter, “Pork Chops, End Tables and
]ur'iior's,” Bonacuse heaps several
paragraphs of blithering chauvi-
nism at Clinton. Humorous, per-
haps. But his point, “we can’t take
things so seriously,” is almost lost.
Indeed, many people I've spoken to
missed the point of the letter
completely.

Christina Clinton's editorial
raises a controversial issue. It’s a
shame that name calling and flip-
pancy appear as substitutes for
rational debate.‘

“You can lock my body, but not

“Stupid.” .

“What have you done?"

“Nothing, I’ve been framed,” the

“For what?”

“Possession of ' cocaine, with
intent to sell. Woe!”

“But who would want to frame
you?” Socrates asked.

“The government and other car

Dear Editor:

In lieu of some potent out-
bursts printed in The Pitt News
editorial section, it seems we
students are in need of a social
problem. We've angrily
defended ourselves against
claims that this university is a
den of liquidity. We've roared at
the audacity of misquoting rock
and roll. The only issue raised
lately that was less than frivo-
lous has been the attack on the
moral fiber of Pitt females by a
couple of outspoken engineers.
Who, by the way, made Archie
Bunker seem liberal.

If we've got the spirit of the
sixties, why not take on a real
earth-shattering problem. Pos-

say, “Give me Frivolity or Give

freedom of speech and protest

“Look,” he shouted. “My lawyer
got me a jury trial, so I can play on
their emotions and get the sym-
pathy vote. It’s the least he could do‘

« for what he charges!”

“Will it work?” Socrates asked,
stroking his beard.

“Sure I’ll bring in my wife and
kids. Hell, maybe I’ll buy an old
lady and claim that she's my grand-
mother, who I also happen to sup-
port.”

“But the facts? Won’t the jury
listen to the facts?" Socrates asked.

“I hope not, or I’m a dead man,”
the stranger said.

“But that’s not right,” protested
Socrates. ‘

“Who cares? It's the American
way!”

“What about people with

 smaller crimes than yours? They

get put in jail because they'can’t
afford an expensive lawyer.”
“Let ‘em rot,” the stranger

“But_...'_’

i just then the guard entered, say-
mg, Come on, your five-million
bail has been posted.” The stranger
jumped off the bed and started to
leave.

“Hey, when do I get the car you
promised for the extra ration?” the
guard asked.

“Tomorrow," the stranger ans.
wered; “Well, good-bye! Hey! Do
you like the door? I designed it
myself!"

Socrates watched as the door
swung downward and locked.
Leaning back, he decided to write a
book on what justice was and what
it now is.

Modern Manners is a program of etiquette for
a very rude world. Amy Vanderbilt, Emily Post,
and other such people have their works repeat-
edly updated, but—no matter how current they
attempt to be——they‘have absolutely no rele-
vancy for the college campus. P.J. O’Rourke
does! For example, the writers of Emily Post

  have never issued instructions detailing the

proper procedure to introduce your father’s
homosexual lover to your fraternity.

Let’s face it friends——good old fashion class,
taste, and conscience have all but disappeared

from the minds of contemporary Americans,

but not from P.J. O’Rourke’s. Come hear what

he has to say.

Now it's easy at The Tower. A condomin-
ium at Chatham Center. Because we've
developed a plan that, in conjunction
with the Economic Recovery Act of 1981,
makes it possible for buyers of condo-
miniums to create tax losses when renting
those condominiums to relatives or co-
owners.

The plan also permits accelerated
depreciation, which allows the owner of
a rental property to write off its value in
15 years instead of 25 to 40 years. That
means a king-size annual tax deduction
for your parents. And best of all, a beau-
tiful apartment home for you at The Tower.
With a private'doorman to greet you 24
hours a day. And an elegant hospitality
lounge where you can study, or just relax.

As a resident of The Tower, you'll have
special privileges to the Chatham Hyatt
Health Club, where you can start your
day with a workout, sauna or swim.

And all this is waiting for you in the
heart of Pittsburgh’s dynamic Renais-
sance ll. Convenient to school and just
minutes from shopping, dining and excit-
ing nighttime entertainment.

So what are you waiting for? Now,
instead of asking for more money, you
canwrite home and tell your parents
how to get in on some major tax and
equity benefits.

They’ll be very impressed with all that

The Inside Story:  

Keeping Jazz Alive In
Pittsburgh:
A Tradition Continues

Jazz. The word conjures many
images in a person’s mind: Bourbon
Street, Al Hirt_and old men playing
bent and tarnished trumpets with
superb clarity are the typical
thoughts that portray the jazz scene
in America. However, jazz is also
Czechoslovakia, Jamaica, Peru and
Japan._ Although it had its begin-
nings in America, jazz is now an
international music form. A good
opportunity to experience it is the
Twelfth Annual Jazz Seminar to be
held at the University of Pittsburgh
on Nov. 4th, 5th and 6th.

The program this year will
advance the seminar’s original
goal—to be a time of lecture and
teaching by those people who have
created the music. As Dr. Nathan
Davis, director of Jazz Studies at
Pitt said, “We’ve had everyone
here.” Past jazz seminars have
included “jazz dignitaries” such as
Dizzy Gillespie, Ron Carter, Terry
Pollard and Sonny Rollins among

program for the next year.”

The idea was extended into the
next year, and in 1977-78, the
seminar took on an international
perspective when Kenny Clarke, a
guest-lecturer from Paris, France,
and Dexter Gordon from Copenha-
gen, Denmark, returned to the U.S.
after many years abroad to take part
in the seminar program.

The appearance of these two
international artists and Davis’s fre-
quent European stops has led to the
appearances this year of Miroslav
Vitous, Czechoslovakia’s award
winning bassist, formerly with Her-
bie Mann and Weather Report,
Terumasa Hino-,' Japan’s most
important jazz musician; Monty
Alexander, Jamaica’s top jazz pian-
ist; and Alex Acuna, Peru’s
drummer of the year, also formerly
of Weather Report. Also included
wil be one of America’s most popu-
lar jazz artists of the ’80s, Grover
Washington, Jr. The artists will con-
duct seminars in the Frick Fine Arts

 

ssidie mez an rummer redie aits played

at the 11th annual Jazz Seminar Concert.

others contributing their knowledge
of the art form to the student, fac-
ulty, community and interested
fans. “There isn’t anything like it,”
said Davis. “You’ll probably never
see these people together at one
time again.”

Davis was responsible for the
original occurrence of the jazz
seminar, now in its twelfth year. .

“The Art Blakely Jazz Group was
playing at the old Crawford Grill,
and I asked them to come to Pitt and
talk to the students; it seemed to be
a good idea so we put together a

auditorium, giving students a
chance to work with them on a one-
to-one basis. It ends in a concert
Saturday Nov. 6th at Carnegie
Music Hall, featuring all of the artists
and Davis, who plays soprano sax.
As Davis said, “There is nothing like
it.”

An offspring of Pitt’s unique
annual jazz seminar was the Jazz
Hall of Fame, created in 1977. Pitt is
the first university in the world,
explained Davis, to have a hall of
fame. “It was an idea that came
about since there are so many

artists that don’t get the recognitioﬁ
that they deserve, so now we can
honor them at Pitt. The new Hall of
Fame is going to be housed in the
Student Union when the renovation
is completed.”

Some, of. the artists who have
been selected are: Louis Arm-
strong, trumpeter; Duke Ellington,
composer; Billie Holliday, singer;
Art Tatum, pianist; and Charlie
Parker, alto sax great.

The objectives of the Hall of Fame
are to make Pittsburgh and the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh the world cen-
ter for jazz recognition, to establish
a perpetual place of recognition for
jazz artists, composers and writers
and to annualy elect two artists,
composers or writers, one living and
one deceased, to the hall. Annual
winners are announced at the con-
cert each year.

The hall of fame is to be funded by
private resources within the com-
munity to help reinforce the educa-
tional thrust of the jazz art form.

The Jazz Hall of Fame and the
annual jazz seminar are meant to
benefit the entire university and not
just music students.

“It’s designed for everyone,” said
Davis. “I tell the lecturers that the
audience is going to have a wide
range of interests and knowledge so
they gear their talks around that.
There won’t be a problem if you
aren’t familiar with the jazz form.”

Some of the highlights of this
year’s seminar will be a performance
by the Pitt Jazz Band in the Towers
lobby on Wednesday Nov. 3 from
4-6 p.ni. George Butler, vice-
president of Columbia Records will
talk about the music industry on
Thursday, Nov. 4. There will be two
workshops on Friday Nov. 5—a gui-
tar workshop with Grover Wasliiiig
ton, Jr.—as well as a gospel concert
by Dr. Ralph Hill of the Sounds of
Heritage that evening at 8 p.m. in
the Frick Fine Arts Building.

There will be more seminars on
Saturday, followed by “An Evening
of International Jazz” at Carnegie
Music Hall. Dr. Donald Henderson,
associate provost of Pitt, will be the
master of ceremonies. Tickets for
the concert are $4 for Pitt students
and $8 for all others. They can be
purchased at the Student Union
ticket office.

Historically, the city of Pittsburgh
has been influenced by jazz. It was a
convenient resting place for musi-
cians when they travelled from New
York to Chicago.

“A lot of great talent is in this
city,” Davis explained. “A lot of
great musicians come from here. lt’s
not a great club town, but it is a great
concert town.” D5

Last year’s concert was a culmination of talent with Nathan Davis, Eddie Gomez, and
James Moody playing at Carnegie Music Hall.

last year’s concert.

ARTISTS FROM
AROUND THE WORLD ,
JOIN SEMINAR

Musicians from all over the world
will give workshops and perform
together in a concert at the 12th
annual Jazz Seminar and Concert
l‘.{ﬁiV..‘lfb .-$1123,-':."‘.ﬁ:.“icT_;h: ii:.:.;*A}+;
will take place in the Frick Fine Arts
auditorium during the three-day
event and the concert is slated for
Saturday, Nov. 6th at 8:00 p.m. at
Carnegie Music Hall.

This year’s experts include saxo-
phonist/composer Grover
Washington Jr., Jamaican pianist
Monty Alexander, Japanese trum-
peter Terumasa Hino, Czechoslov-
akian bassist Miroslav Vitous, guita-
rist Ted Dunbar, Peruvian drummer
Alex Acuna and Pitt’s Jazz Studies
Director Nathan Davis on soprano
saxophone.

According to Davis, Grover
Washington Jr. is “America’s most
popular jazz artist of the 80’s.” His
11th album “Winelight” held the no.
1 spot on the jazz LP charts for
more than six months. He produced
his most recent album, “Come
Morning,” with percussionist/com-
poser Ralph MacDonald, who also
worked on “Winelight.” The guest
vocalist is Grady Tate, who sings a
pair of tunes including “Be Mine
(Tonight),” released as the first
“Come Morning” single in
November, 1981.

Washington was born into a musi-
cal family in Buffalo, New York. “My
mother used to sing in church choirs
and my father used to play saxo-
phone and has an extensive collec-
tion on jazz 78’s,” he said.

He began playing when his father
bought him a saxophone when he
was ten years old. “After l started
playing, I’d sneak into clubs and see
guys like Jack McDuff, Harold Vick
and Charles Lloyd,” said
Washington.

“My professional life began at the
age of 12. I played a lot of R & B
when I was with a singing group and
I also played with a blues band. We
played in every key every night—~it
was perfect training ground,” he
said.

For a while Washington consid-
ered a career as a basketball player,
but decided on music when he
stopped growing. Although he stu-
died classical music, jazz was his
first love. “I still listen to the

‘classics’—Coleman Hawkins, Ben
Webster, Dori Byas, Lester Young,
Charlie Parker, John Coltrane.
Those are the masters and they’ll
tr» mu.” he said. “What I strive for in
to say,” he said. “What I strive for in
my own music is to always tell a
story to portray my inner feelings.”

After serving in the Army,
Washington divided his time
between a job at a record store and
playing in the evenings and on week-
ends with groups in the Philadelphia
and New York areas.

He was then hired to fill a vacancy
in the band led by organist Charles
Earland, and cut the “Living Black!”
LP in 1970. Washington’s reputation
grew after a few more albums as a
sideman recording with CTI and
Prestige artists. When he cut
“Breakout”with Johnny Hammond
in 1970 he established himself as a
major new voice on the sax, due to
the success of the album.

Washington’s first solo LP, “Inner
City Blues,” was so successful, he
finally quit his job at the record
store, put together a band and
began touring. His next three
albums, “All The King’s Horses,”
“Soul Box” and “Mister Magic”
enabled him to leave clubs behind to
headline major concert halls.

Although Washington has limited
his personal appearances lately, he
has not been idle. He played gratis
gigs for inmates at various correc-
tional facilities in the Philadelphia
area as a member of a band called
Dick Klein & The Fifth Amendment,
headed by a local Appeals Court
Judge. He’s currently pursuing a
doctorate in music composition at
Temple University, in order to
improve his writing and arranging.

Joining Washington in thisPyear’s
jazz seminar will be Monty Alex-
ander, described by critics as the
most explosive force in jazz piano in
recent years. Alexander partici-
pated in the seminar last year and
according to Davis “his style is
spiced with flavor of the Caribbean
islands that are his home.”

Like Washington, Alexander
grew up with music. “There was a
piano in the house and early on I
would play on it. I was about three

years old,” he said. “Later, there ”

were parties with everyone dancing
and singing and I’d go right to the
piano and join in. That’s where I first
learned about music asxa live cele-

,. bration with people. I was about

ten.”

In Jamaica, where Alexander
lived, rhythm and blues began to
gain popularity. Played Caribbean
style, it became known as ska. One
of Alexander’s first bands “Monty
and the Cyclones” had island hits
during this period.

After moving to Miami when he
was 17, Alexander decided that he
definately wanted to be a musician.
When he went to New York, he got
more exposure to jazz musicians.
“Sounds like Ray Brown’s bass and
Erroll Gerner’s piano were very,
very strong feelings for me,” he said.
“One night I heard Wes Montgom-
ery at the Half Note...l still listen to
him after all these years.”

Alexander considers his own
style an amalgam of different styles.
He will demonstrate it at his Satur-
day afternoon workshop and again
at the concert on Saturday night.

Also bringing an international fla-
vor to the jazz seminar and concert
is Terumasa Hino, who is, according
to Davis, “one of the most important
figures in Asian jazz and the best
trumpet player in Japan. He com-
bines the styles of Woody Shaw and
Freddie Hebbard in a way that is his
own.”

Hino was exposed to the world of

 music at a very early age by his

father, who was also a trumpeter.
He bagan playing the trumpet in ele-
mentary school and began perform
ing professionally by the time he
reached. junior high. He became
interested in jazz after graduating
from high school.

Monty Alexander

Much of Hino’s knowledge of
music has come from studying peo-
ple like Miles Davis, Chet Baker and
Kenny Dorham on his own. But he
also studied at the New Century
Music Conservatory, a private
organization composed mainly of
musicians working with innovative
types of music.

Hino was very active on the Japa-
nese jazz scene for years before
coming to the United States for the
first time in 1970. He cut two albums
while he was in New York, “Hino’s
Journey to Air” and “Alone
Together.” He returned the next
year and recorded “Love Nature”
and also played for the second time
at the Berlin Jazz Festival, which

brought him world-wide recognition.

Hino recorded three albums in F

1972 and also made his first appear-
ance at the Newport Jazz Festival.
with his own quintet. He kept busy
during the next few years, but in
1975 he disbanded-his group and
moved to New York. He soon joined
Jackie McLean’s group and later
played with Larry Coryell’s “11th
House Band,” with whom he tra-
velled to Europe.

The album “Wishes/‘Kochi’ ” saw
Hino’s move into jazz—rock fusion in
1976. It was a controversial album in
Japan; some critics saw it as a mere
imitation of the recent works of
Miles Davis, while others saw it as a
unique coming together of Eastern
and Western jazz.

Hino’s most recent albums reveal
his unique combination of electronic
and acoustic music. He will release a
new album “Pyramid” in early 1983.

Ted Dunbar, whom Davis said to
be “the most sought-after session
player in New York City,” will also
be appearing at this year’s seminar.
Dunbar has worked with jazz greats

like Sonny Rollins and Freddie Hub-
bard and will share his expertise at a
workshop on Friday, Nov. 5.

Dunbar’s talents are not limited to
the guitar. He is an author, an
instructor, a university professor
and a pharmacist—not necessarily
in that order. Born into a family of
pharmacists, Dunbar thought he
would continue the tradition. One
day his mother took him to a Duke
Ellington concert and that was it.
Jazz became his life.

From Texas, where he was born,
Dunbar went to places like Houston
and Indianapolis and then to New
York, where he associated with peo-
ple like Arnett Cobb, Les Spann,
Wes Montgomery, Slide Hampton,
David “Fathead” Newman and Sel-
don Powell. They helped mold his
contemporary style of playing.

It was through Seldon Powell that
Dunbar became involved with the
New York City Jazzmobile, where
he has taught guitar for the past ten
years. He is now an associate pro-
fessor of music at Rutgers
University. _

~ Formerly with Weather Report,
drummer Alex Acuna hails from
Peru and is in fact “the best-known

 

3

jazz musician from that country,’
according to Davis.

Acuna began teaching himself to
play drums and percussion at the
age of five. He became a studio
drummer for Peruvian T.V. when he
was 17. After moving to Puerto Rico
in 1966, he studied at the Puerto
Rico Conservatory of Music. Living
in that country afforded him an
opportunity to perform with many
major Latin artists.

ln 1974, Acuna moved to Las
Vegas where he was asked to join
Weather Report in 1975. He toured
extensively with the band until 1977,
when he moved to L.A. and began
performing with Al Jarreau, Lee Rit-
enour, Diana Ross, Joni Mitchell,
Gato Barbieri, the Crusaders and
many more.

Acuna is currently working on an
album with Chick Corea and Span-
ish guitarist Paco de Lucia.

Also participating in this year’s
seminar is Miroslav Vitous. Accord-
ing to Davis, Vitous has “developed
that special technique that seems to
have emerged among the Eastern
European gypsies from the Eastern
bloc countries. They have an espe-
cially fast, intense way of playing.
That, l think, is best represented by
this Czechoslovakian bass player.”
Vitous formerly played with Herbie
Mann and Weather Report.

Spikers Set For

Far Out Tourney

By MARK A. SINDLER

To date, Lady Panther volleyball
coach Shelton Collier has not
strayed far from the home front for
a road game. The farthest the
squad has ventured was West Vir-
ginia on an Oct.,l trip.

That will all change tomorrow.
The Lady Panthers fly to North
Carolina State for a three-day
round robin tournament against
four teams: Georgia, Tennessee,
North Carolina and NCSU. The
Panthers enter the showdown with
the distinction of being the top-
seeded team in the event.

“Pitt is the top-ranked team in
the tournament,” Collier boasted.
“The team is excited over the pros-
pect of playing in the South.”

Collier also emphasized that it’s
important for his players to per-
form well. Citing the NCAA as very
conference-oriented, Collier said
that his team will represent the
entire Big East Conference and not
just Pitt.

The North Carolina teams are
situated in the Atlantic Coast Con-
ference (ACC) while Georgia and

Tennessee hail from the Southeast
Conference (SEC).

Collier further elaborated on
how these teams, and women’s
sports in general, have not been
part of the ACC or SEC in the past.
Their conferences are, however,
well established in other sports.
Thus, it is significant that the
Panthers play well because the Big
East is in its fledgling stage.

“And,” Collier said, “how, well
we do this weekend will determine
how well we do in the .NCAA’s:’’

The upcoming weekend's play
will feature the return of injured
star-spiker Ulana Kohutiak. Col-
lier will not use her regularly but
rather on a substitutional basis.

“She has to work her way back in
the lineup andwill be used in a
limited role,” he said.

Since Kohutiak was injured, the

‘team has posted a 19-3 match

record. Considering her ligament.
injury and other players’ ailments
and setbacks, Collier cannot com-
plain about his team’s ‘record. I

not too cautious. Conservative

coach in the country should play
that style of football. How many

Schubert Kicks
Into Endzone

By BRIAN BALK

He possesses enough power in
his left leg to light the entire Pitt
campus. Eric Schubert, however,
chooses to apply this awesome
energy to blasting footballs
between goalposts and into oppo-
nents’ end zones.

At 5-8, l80 lbs., Schubert has
developed a leg comparable to a
howitzer. Schubert’s leg is so
strong that of his 27 kickoffs, 19
have not been returned.

Schubert agrees that strength is
his biggest attribute. It is a strength
that has been developed.

“My workouts consist of a lot of
squats and other leg—work exer-
cises,” Schubert explained.

Schuberts’s small, stocky frame
and over-developed quads have
enabled him to boot fieldgoals at
incredible distances. Although he
has yet to be tested from that far in a
game situation, Schubert has
kicked the ball 63 yards in
practices.

“Once in Biloxie (Mississippi), I
kicked a 74—yarder with the wind,”
Schubert said.

Even with the many pressure
situations hovering over him,
Schubert says he concentrates on
very little.

“I concentrate on keeping my
head down and following through.
That’s about it.”

Part of his success in kicking-
extra points can be credited to
Panther holder Dan Daniels.

“The placement of the ball is
very crucial,” said Schubert. Luck-
ily, I have the best holder in the
nation—Dan Daniels.”

Schubert believes he has the
potential to be a great field goal
kicker.

“I’ve only had the opporunity to
attempt eight field goals thisyear.
Look at the well known college
kickers around the nation. They
have had 24 to 30 attempts,” Schu-
bert said.

Consistent Zygarowicz Moves To Link Position

By TAMMY ANDERSON

One thing has remained consis-
tent in every story written on the
Lady Panther field hockey team-
the name Terry Zygarowicz. Her
consistent play may well be the
Panthers’ most valuable weapon.

“Terry is a coach's dream
player,” says Pitt coach Cindy Bald
ridge, “She isiour most consisten
player and has an excellent all-
around game. She has been a big
help to the team in the past and
will play a valuable role in the
future.”

Zygarowicz has competed in
organized field hockey since her
freshman year at Edgewood High
School. She started all four years
there at the halfback position.

During her senior year, Edge-
wood captured the WPIAL crown
and reached the second round of
PIAA State Playoffs, before losing
to Westchester East High School.

In her freshman season at Pitt,
Zygarowicz started at halfback and
was named to the Pitt II Team for
her play during the season.

This season brought a change in
position for Zygarowicz—she
moved from halfback to link (a
combination of attacker and half-
back).

The change in position enabled.

her to participate in offense as well
as defense. The results have been
positive for both Zygarowicz and
the team.

Since moving to link, she has
scored three goals this season,
which is three more than she scored
last season. “I didn’t feel as if I
was utilizing all of my ability at the
halfback position last year,” Zyga-
rowicz explains. “I’m enjoying
playing link this year because I get
the chance to be an offensive player
as well as a defensive player.”

I Zygarowicz has not only become
an offensive player, but she may
have emerged an offensive threat.

Lady Panther Field Hockey player Terry Zygarowicz (front left) has made a successful transition to the link

position.

Baldridge says, “The change in
Terry’s position from halfback to
link has been very beneficial for the
team. Terry has scored three crucial
goals for us this season and has
come close to scoring several other
times.

“I switched Terry to the link
position because I was confident in
her skill and ability,” Baldridge
continues “She has made the tran-
sition very successfully."

Perhaps the best skill that Zyga-
rowicz possesses is her well-
developed stickwork.

“That is the best aspect of Ter-
ry’s game,” Baldridge says. “She
has the uncanny ability to throw
teams off balance by beating indi-
vidual players with her smooth

stickwork and well—executed
moves.”
Developing the stickwork has
been a gradual process. “The
summer before my senior year of
high school, I attended a camp that

was taught by Olympic players,”

Zygarowicz says. “After watching‘

them play and trying to apply their
techniques te.my own play, I grad-
ually developed my stickwork.

“My stickwork ability is a result
of watching others play and seeing
how they move, rather than a result
of personal acheivement.”

According to Zygarowicz, the key

‘to a successful team is “the proper

combination of good stickwork
and consistent passing.” Zygaro-
wicz is a good example.

She brings more to the field than
her stick. “Terry is a quiet leader
on and off the field without know-
ing it,” Baldridge says. “When she
has a bad game, the whole team
suffers because she influences ev-
eryone else’s performances. Terry
doesn’t brag about her play either.
She simply goes out there and
shows you what she can do.”

Furthermore, Baldridge offers,
“Terry helps out on and off the
field because she knows her posi-
tion and the game so well. Terry
will play a big part in the success of
our team over the next two sea-

because we are maturing as players
and are improving with each
game,” Zygarowicz predicts. “Our
improvement this season is due to
our working together as a unit and
also our realization of each other’s
play.
“We should be better next season
for the simple reason that we are
basically more experienced and we

does happen, are two different

He is not resentful though, for as
he explained, “Pitt is not the kind
of team to drive the ball all the way
down the field and then get stuck.
We take it that Dan will score the
touchdown.”

One of the reasons for Schubert’s
maturing into a top notch kicker is
that of an unusual childhood
habit.

“I used to go around and kick
anything; balls, rocks....” he said.
“Then, when I started kicking for

as a power-horse tailback. His
powerful thighs did more than
kick back then; he rushed for over
200 yards in one game.

Schubert was not that productive
in high school, mostly because he
was plagued with injuries.

“My junior year, Igot hit after an
extra point and tore cartilage in my
knee," Schubert said.

. Schubert did not immediately
receive a scholarship at Pitt. He
made the team as a walk-on when
he first ventured on to the stadi-
um’s astro turf. This spring he

earned a full scholarship.

His roommate, punter Dave’
Hepler, said that Schubert is not as
calm and collected as he appears
before a game.

“He is psycho,” Hepler jokingly
said. “He has to wear these special
blue and white socks and special
shoes, or else he says he can’t kick.”

Everybody has their own idio-
syncrasies. Schubert is no different.

Schubert added, “You’ve got to
have confidence in yourself
because everybody always gets’
down on the kicker.”

Pee Wee ball, I started watching
different styles of kicking."

Cross Country Season

Has FewHighlights

By CHARLIE O'HARA

The review of the 1982 Pitt
cross-country season is unim-
pressive. Only three meets were
held and the success was
limited.

The Panthers opened with a
tri-meet victory over two local,
but very shallow teams-
Robert Morris and Duquesne.
The Panthers placed seven
runners in the top eight slots.
The level of competition was
summed up best by junior Bill
Moorehead when he said,“Ro-
bert Morris and Duquesne are
not even what we consider
competition.”

Two weeks later, the Panth-
ers traveled to the Akron Invita-

tional, where they tied with
Akron for third, behind Cleve-
land State and Malone College.

Coach John Vasvary, who
termed the race a “test” for the
Panthers, felt the team showed
improvement, but still had a
way to go. Many of the Panthers
set lifetime marks for the 10-
kilometer distance.

Todd Colas and Bill Moore-
head had the highest finishes
for the Panthers, who scored
scored 78 points, which was
considerably higher than
winner Cleveland State’s 34.

The team then had two weeks
to train for a Big East meet that

competition. Though they fin-
ished a disappointing eighth
place, defeating only Seton
Hall, the Panthers ran without
Bill Moorehead and Scott
Hartford.

“If we had either of them,”
Vasvary said, “the race, from
our standpoint, would have
been much different.”

“Injuries are a part of the
sport and unfortunately we had
them at an inopportune time.”

In reference to those who
made the Big East trip, Vasvary
remarked, “Overall, we had big
individual improvements, but
as a team we could have done
better.”

Senior Darren Geary, who
ran for the first time during the
season in the Big East meet,
placed 39th and was the second
Panther across the finish line.
Todd Colas finished 31st.

With the completion of the
season, a question needs an

answer. What was accomp-
lished? “They learned a great
deal about themselves as
runners,” Vasvary answered.

“They now know what it is
going to take to be in top shape
for next year.”

Vasvary expressed optimism
toward next season. “We have a
good number of runners com-
ing back. If we can get some
capable recruits, then things

Worthy recruits are necessary
for a cross country team that
appears short on depth.
Though they can’t sign a letter
of intent until April, Vasvary
has been contacting ‘athletes
from various parts of the coun-
try, trying to stay a step ahead of
other schools.

Concerning possible recru-its
from Western Pennsylvania,
Vasvary remarked, “We hope to
influence as many as are availa-
ble to stay home.”

There is quite a bit of talent
this year in Western Pennsylva-
nia. If Pitt can land some of it,
the reviews of next season will
be Inuch more complete.

NOTE: Training for the
indoor track season begins
soon. Pitt’s 2-mile relay team
has been eagerly awaiting the
season. They expect to qualify
for the nationals.

“The thing I'm most pleased
about is that we don't have to come
home after each weekend and jus-
tify our losses‘ due to the excess of
injuries,” Collier said. “I am really
proud of the quality people who
have filled in. It is.a solidifying
force amongst the team, coming
home with tournament charnpion-
ships as we have.”

a The Panthers, 32-4 overall, are
further buoyed by  lot of excite-
ment in the administration and the

volleyball community,” Collier
said.

He mentioned how often his
players have been meeting the var-
ious challenges thrown their way,
one of which has been a name for
themselves.

As the Panthers continue to
defend their reputation, there may
be room for over—confidence—a
malady that has already plagued
the team this season. “We’re

ﬂmature enough to prepare for
what's ahead of us,” Collier said.
“These teams coming up will con-
tinue to test our abilities. We will
not sit on our hands but will
emphasize execution continually,
regardless of the competition.”

As has been the case in the past,
Collier will ask more of his team
than it is able to do. “Lackadaisical
attitudes will not be tolerated, "he
stated, “but really shouldn’t be a
problem because the quality the
opposition will ‘keep the players
on their toes.”’ C

One team that will undoubtedly
keep Pitt's eyes glued straight
ahead is Sid Feldman’s Georgia
Bulldogs. Collier put Georgia, 35-
4, in the same class as his team.

It was just last year that Feldman
was lolling around in the dol-
drums amidst a horrible slump.

“Since last year, we have had an

‘automatic improvement in a recur-

9

ring mental problem,’ Feldman
explained. “We had good athletes,
but not great ones. I don’t know
what it is this year—we have had
good players and a good attitude,"
“It's incredible.
There have been times when we
have been down ewtlj’, and then
we'll break the l);:ri.lrs of our
opponents." ’

Although Feldman points to
good receiving and tough serving
as team strengths, his squad is very
predictable against a good block-
ing team.

Georgia has already scored three
tournament championships and

‘two second-place finishes.

“It has been an up-and-down
schedule  Feldman maintained.
“First, it's some low teams we play,
then we come up against teams like
Penn State or Ohio State.”

Perhaps a reason for Feldman’s
new—found success is his acquiring
junior setter Jackie Becker, who
once had aspirations of attending
Pitt. When he rambles on about
her, Feldman sounds as if he just
won the Irish Sweepstakes.

“She’s a winner,” he said. “She is
looking forward desperately for
this match against Pitt." After
originally looking at Kent State,
Becker went south after Feldman
offered her a scholarship.

Before facing Pitt though, Feld-
man cautioned, “IfJulie Gaul (Pitt
captain) has an outstanding game,
there is no stopping her. The same
can be said of Jackie, of course.
Anything can happen in the morn-
ing." (The match is slated for a 10
a.m. start Saturday.)

Feldman is quick to say he’s not
bragging, but rather is pleased
with a team that used to enter
matches just hoping not to lose.

“Now, we go in to win," he said.
“The girls feel good about the way
they are playing," he continued.
“We are playing very successfully.
In fact. I am ecstatic over beating
the teams we beat.”

A major reason for this is proba-
bly that Georgia now has its own
home court, something nonexist-
ent five years ago. For Feldman,
getting the 400 spectators is a big
deal. It used to be that Southerners
never even heard of the “forearm
pass.”

It has also been difficult for Feld-
man to have a winning team
because of recruiting restrictions.
He cites the advantage Pennsylva-
nia schools have with in—state
volleyball.

I “It is one of the most fertile
grounds for potentially strong vol-
leyl)all players. We have to train
girls from down here, and it will
take them two or three years to
produce."

Feldman likes where he’s at,
though, because he would rather
have weaker athletes who want to
“fight it out” than stronger ones
who will “sit back.”

“If we have girls putting out 50
percent,” Feldman stated, “I will

tell them to get out unless they give
110 percent. Ours are willing to do
anything to win.”

Tennessee coach Bob Bertucci is
leading a 14-4 team into NCSU.

His squad recently forfeited a
match to Louisiana State because
the latter had flight arrangements

and class schedules that interferred

with the match time.

Complications surrounding the
forfeiture resulted in a loss that
dropped Tennessee out of first
place in the SEC and vaulted LSU
into the top spot.

According to Tennessee’s
Women’s Sports Information
Director Debbie Jennings, Bertucci
has played so few matches because
his players compete in many tour-
naments over the summer and
would be susceptible to early burn-
out if subjected to a 45 or 50 match
schedule as has been the custom.

That may be so, but there is a fact
that Tennessee only has six
women's sports teams, and the
school makes sure each one always
reaches the top rankings. All are
currently ranked in the Top 20,
three being in the Top 10.

At Chapel Hill, coach Beth

18-10 team, let alone reach a promi-

“We do not have the intensity,”
Miller remarked. “We hit peaks

level off.” .

Her team‘s strength, she said, lies
in the fact that it’s more of a team’s

and no great player.”

Balance has been the impetus
behind NCSU’s ’82 success, with

losses coming against four good
Division I teams—Maryland,
George Washington, North Carol-
ina and Georgia.

“Appalachian State beat us
because we came down with injur-

down to six players—the bare bot-

tom. It was our fir'st‘loss to them in
six years.”
