Among the students earning
degrees from the University of
Pittsburgh this spring, there was
one famous honoree: “Dr. Dan.”

Dr. Dan, better known as
former Miami Dolphin and
Pitt quarterback Dan, Marino,

~ was the guest speaker at Pitt's

commencement ceremony, where

4,317 undergraduate, master's and ,

doctoral students ofﬁcially became
alumni.

Graduating senior Sheila. Isong
delivered the student response.

Chance11orMarkA.Nordenberg P

awarded Pitt ‘alumnus Marino
an honorary doctoral degree in
broadcast journalism, making him
the ﬁrst graduate in Pitt's Class
of 2008_. Marine said thathe will

make sure his colleagues at CBS’s ’

“The NFLToday” will know of his
accomplishment. '

“Now they have to refer to me
as Dr. Dan,” saidrMarino'. -

, Nordenberg introduced Marino
to the crowd in the Petersen Events
Center as an outstanding ‘football
player, Panther and person.

 

Hall of Famer Dan Marino reflects on his timeas a Pitt student at the 2008 Commencement Ceremony.

“He has excelled in his current
role, not because he threw 420
touchdown passes, but because
he is intelligent, articulate and
analytical, the qualities of a
well~educated person,” said
Nordenberg.

Marino, a member of both the
Pro Football and NCAA halls

of fame, graduated from Pitt’s '

School of Arts " and Sciences in
1983. He reﬂected on his Oakland
upbringing andithie years he spent
at Pitt. '

He urged graduates to volunteer their time
and expertise similarly.

After Marino’s address came the
presentation of doctoral degrees. Pitt had
801 applications for doctoral degrees from
its 15 graduate and professional schools.
At the time of the ceremony, many of the
law, medicine and dental medicine students
had not ﬁnished their programs and did not
attend the ceremony. .

Next, Isong spoke about thanking the

people who have helped the graduates
along the way. Isong, a member of the
Student Government Board and president
of the Black Action Society for 2007-08,
expressed immense pride in Pitt’s student-
run organizations as well as in the graduating
class as a whole.

“We are the smartest class that Pitt
has ever ‘graduated, and we should be
commended and congratulated,” said Isong.

With all the talent Pitt’s class of 2008
possesses, Isong said that the students have

high praises for her Classmates

an obligation to remember their alma mater
and to give back to Pitt. She said that with
a world—class education, the students should
settle for nothing but the best. In addition,
Isong believes that Pitt’s class of 2008 has a
great responsibility.

“I charge you with the task of making
the world a better place. This is an arduous
task,” said Isong. “Make money and use
your money for good. Excel in whatever
ﬁeld your heart desires.”

bill deﬁes Democrats ’ promises

The i 2006 mid—term elec-

itions made Democrats the
 majority in Congress, prov-

iing once and for all that

Americans were unsatisfied
with the Republican leader-
ship and with the Bush ad-
ministration’s handling of the
war in Iraq. For many voters,
the new Democratic majority
was a sign that things were
going to change.

Indeed, after the elections,
newly elected Speaker of the
House Nancy Pelosi prom-
ised to lead the country in
a new direction “in partner-

ship, not in partisanship,” re—\

ported CNN.

Two years later, however,
Pelosi seems to have forgot-
ten her promise.

House Democrats are

 planning to bring a $178 bil-

lion war—spending measure

 to the ﬂoor this week. The
i proposed bill would include‘

unemployment assistance
and educational benefits for

;returning veterans, as well
 as provisions for troop with-
5 drawals.

On the surface, the pro-
posal seems like a good one.
Supporting veterans should
be a priority for the Bush
administration. But from the
onset, the Democrats have

g been irresponsible and unfair
j in planning the bill — so ir-
%responsible, in fact, that it

seems they are playing by
the partisan rules of former
Republican House Majority
Leader Tom Delay, who made
sure to push the Republican
agenda through the House.
Democrats have not'dis-
' closed the details of the bill
and have prepared it- mostly

i behind closed doors, The New
;York Times said. Further-
 more, the Democrats failed
 to put the measure through

formal committee
angered House Republicans
who demand more openness.

Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif.,
told The Times, “The Demo-
crat leaders of the House and
Senate are attempting to jam
a $200—plus billion spending
bill through Congressiwith
absolutely no oversight or
scrutiny.” .

In their attempt to dodge
scrutiny, the Democrats have
lost our trust and respect.

President George W. Bush
has been adamant about his
opposition to any legislation
that surpasses his spending
request for the war. Rather,
he said he would consider
more aid for veterans as
long as it was separate from
the war—spending measure.
The Times reported that Re-
publicans have been putting
together_ substitute plans,
which have garnered some
bipartisan support.

The Democrats’ plan,

however, is to tie the veteran— 5
spending measure to the war- 
spending measure to make 
difficult for the Republicans 
to oppose it or for the presi- 
dent to veto it in an electiong

But a strategy of _ this

Feeling blue? Do some yoga

by Cassidy Gruber
Coiumrulit

  

 
 

Last week was dangerous.
Those few days between the
end of finals and the start of

summer jobs can be viciously
hollow, and while many stu-
dents fill this gap by returning
home to do laundry and stock
up on summer clothes, I chose
the more troublesome path and
decided to spend my empty
days here in Pittsburgh.

The first day, we had a
cookout r‘

The second day, I threw

and hotdog buns from the
cookout onto my roommate’s
car, hoping to lure the squir-
rels to them.

The third day, I didn’t get‘

out of bed.
I was feeling a little spiritu-
ally empty by the third day. As

 in most moments of transition,

While we encourage legis- 
lation to benefit war veterans, 
we do not support the Demo- 3
strategy of keeping f
the Republicans in the dark. E
Good leadership is fair lead- 3
ership, something the Demo- 

I could not-only not see what
the point had been to all of the

work I’d done last semester, I

but I could also not see what

any point could be to anything

I might do this summer. And
with six days of irresponsibil-

 ity and idleness ahead, I knew
i something must be done to re-

store my faith in a deeper pur-

pose. Otherwise, I might be in .

danger of ’ wasting the entire
summer like a zombie, waiting
for autumn to return. ,

Luckily for me, my sum-
mery activities in those first
three _days included not only
buying a badminton set, shop-
ping for sundresses and begin-
ning my summer reading list,
but also miniature golfing.

It was during this miniature
golf match — ‘unfortunately, I

didinot win —- that I was co—-

erced into starting yoga. Co-
erced is not, perhaps, the best
word to use, but it’s close. I
had been talking about tak-
ing yoga for a few weeks but
hadn’t really had enough mo-
tivation to go.

But as the eventual winner
putt—putted his way to vic-
tory, one of my golfing pals
announced that he would be
taking a trip to South Carolina
and that we were invited to
join him. At the beach.

If there’s one thing I hate ,

about summer, it’s the impli-
cation that I should be glad
that I get to go to the beach. I

‘actually don’t like the beach.

I sunburn very easily, the
snacks always end up full of

sand, and once I was bit by a
crab. It just*doesn’t always
seem worth it.

But I do love South of the
Border. I will get sunburned if
it means stopping at South of
the Border.

I was in. Which meant
shopping for bathing suits.
Which meant yoga.

That Monday, I grabbed a
yoga buddy-— because I can’t
do new things alone —— and we
headed to a “hot” yoga studio.
A hot yoga studio differs from
a regular yoga studio _in that it
is incredibly, incredibly hot. I
started sweating as soon as we
got into the room: a long rect-
angle of polished hardwood
floors with three windows at
one end looking down onto
the street below. I paid for the
class, rented a mat and set up,
somewhat nervously, against
one of the purple walls with
my buddy on the other side.

Our instructor was a nice-

enough guy, who reassured us

that it was a personal lesson
and that the pace should be our

own and not reﬂective of what , ‘

anyone around us was doing.
Easy for him to say. i
We started the class with
three “oms” to get in touch

History, responsibility justify the use of steroids

     

by Brandon Pfeffer

Colummlat

The scene is Britain, 1889.
In search of a chemical to
lengthen the human lifespan,

neurologist Charles—Edouard
Brown—Sequard injects him-
self with a preparation of dog-
and guinea pig-testicle extract.

. Though the hypodermic injec-

tion leads to short—term gains
in his vitality and strength,
the Brown—Sequard Elixir, as‘
it came to be known, does not
achieve its purpose of fending
off the inevitable: Brown—Se-
quard died in 1894.

Of course, the practice of-

using substances for perfor-
mance gain or merely enhanc-
ing one’s physical stature has
been around for thousands of
years. Naturally, as our knowl-
edge of the human body and
its chemistry has increased,
so has the potency of these
substances. Today it comes
as a presupposition to many
of us —— an undeniable fact of
modern life —, that anabolic
steroid abuse is a major prob-

lem in our culture. Still, I have
an oddly difficult time trying
to justify exactly why we feel
that way.

According to an article on
a vitamin and health-supple-
ments Web site, athletes take
anabolic steroids to bulk up
and enhance their muscle mass‘
and to discourage fat buildup.
These steroids spur protein
production in the body, which
in turn builds up muscle dur-
ing exercise. When taken in
the proper dosage, the steroids
are supposed to enhance the
body’s tissue-building prop-
erties, while suppressing the
undesirable secondary sexual
effects they’ve become known
for. It’s easy to imagine why a
professional athlete or anyone
who wants to control his or her
body composition would find
that attractive.

But anabolic steroid use has

been deemed such a hazard‘

thatthe U.S. government has
declared it a banned substance.
The Drug Enforcement Agency
has it listed as a Schedule III
Controlled Substance, mean-
ing a first-time conviction of

simple possession could en-
tail a one-year imprisonment
in addition to a fine of at least
$1,000. The U.S. Congress
continues to pour its resources
into investigating the role of
perfor1nance—enhancing sub-
stances within the world of
athletics, and the topic seems
to make an almost daily ap-
pearance on “Pardon the Inter- _
ruption.”

Media reports give the im-
pression that steroid use is
rampant in the United States,
particularly with high school-
and college-aged men. How-
ever, according to the Univer-
sity of Michigan’s Monitoring
the Future study, the amount
of eighth, 10th and 12th grad-K
ers trying steroids at least
once has steadily dropped
since 2000. Their latest stud-
ies reported the amount of
12th graders having ever used
steroids at 2.2 percent. Now
take into account that the same
study found 7.8 percent of
those high school seniors had
experimented with cocaine.

To some extent, banning
steroids is about protecting

ourselves from their negative
effects. Most objections to an-
abolic steroids come from their
well-known side effects: hair
loss, hormone imbalance, pim-
ple breakouts, shrunken tes-
ticles and gynecomastia (male
mammary gland enlargement).
According to WebMD, devel-
oping teens are at particular
risk for additional complica-
tions, including limiting long-
bone growth and inhibiting the
user’s potential height.

But there is a tremendous
difference in the mindset of
an impressionable kid who
still doesn’t have his driving
permit and an educated adult
looking to bulk up quickly
alongside a healthy diet and
exercise. That’s why we utilize
age—dependent laws on other
substances, namely alcohol.
Certainly most teens aren’t
ready to weigh the pros and
cons of taking a substance that
might permanently alter their
physiques, for better orworse.
But "many adult bodybuilders
and even casual non-athletes
are capable of recognizing the
risks and benefits involved.

Ofucourse, the other main
objection to anabolic steroids
comes from the playing field.
What are we to think of a pro-
fessional football player who
willingly puts his own health
at risk by taking unsafe levels
of steroids, all to get a half—step
on his opponent? Is that fair to
competitors who might not be
willing to put their own bod-
ies at risk, too? It might not be,
but that argument seems more
suited to individual leagues to
decide upon. That goes for the
NFL, MLB and International
Olympic Committee: Let these
private organizations decide
what’s best for their own ath-
letes instead of letting the fed-
eral government.

When it comes to private
personal use, however, it
seems that an acceptable mid-
dle ground between protecting
teenagers and allowing intelli-
gent adults to weigh the conse-
quences can be reached if we
allow ourselves to re-evaluate
the stigma surrounding it.

Yoga classes a sure cure for the summertime blues

Gruber, page 6 V

with our breathing and quiet
our minds. Then we started
a sun salutation, in which I
guess we were supposed to be
saluting the sun for something.
Unfortunately for the sun, I
was too busy cursing — in a
very un—yoga-like way — my
feeble muscles and their cries
for relief. “No more down-

‘ward facing dog, you torturous

trollop!” they shouted.
I silenced them by focusing
my mind on the neon lights of

South of the Border and the
promise of “Grease”-like sum-
mer lovin’ at the beach.

I kept these things in mind
as I counted my yoga breaths,
imagining the “oms” ﬂowing
in and out of me, trying to ig-
nore the streams of sweat run-
ning down my arms andlegs
as I tree-posed and shoulder-
stood.

And before I knew it, an
hour had passed and our in-
structor turned down the lights,

cranked open the windows and
had us go into corpse—pose, a
very welcome respite for my
strained and unhappy mus-
cles.

After a few minutes of ly-
ing with our eyes closed, co-
cooned in our own sweat and
pain, the instructor told us
to sit at the front of our mats
and seal the lesson with three
“oms.”

We faced the three win-
dows, which let in the eve-

ning light, and the room rose
with sound. I found my own
exhausted “om” to be indis-
tinguishable from that of my
yoga buddy’s and that of the
girl on the mat next to her and
that of the instructor.

Even further, I found that
the “om” was also indistin-
guishable from every other
sound: the clicking of the
heaters as they cooled down,
the sound of cars on the street
below and the breath of the

trees.

It was a moment in which I
felt great clarity, not because I
had realized something about
the unity of things or my place
in the world, but rather be-
cause I had realized that there
was something to realize, and
that realization made all the
gross sweat and painful mus-
cles worthwhile.

For a successful underground-music act, Giri

music. In fact, he doesn’t write any. He leaves
that job up to his favorite pop stars, rappers, rock-
ers or pretty much anyone with a hot beat. You
see, PitIsburgh—native Gillis is a disc jockey in the
most advanced sense of the word —. and he’s the
 at what he does. Girl Talk is a rm1ch-buzzed-

Pitt falls,

by Evan Burgos
Staﬁ’ Writer

According to Pitt senior Dan
Williams, there’s nowhere for Pitt
baseball to go but up.

And after struggling through
the recent part of the season, he
might be right. ‘

“We have six conference
games left, and we’ll just try and
make something happen,” said
Williams.

The squad kept busy with nine
contests since ﬁnals, managing
four wins. -

The Panthers (16-28, 6-15 Big
East) continued to struggle with
consistency, notching just two con-
ference victories in that stretch.

Williams, who’s had a hot bat
lately, said .he’s looking for the
team to pull off some victories in
the 10 remaining games of the sea-
son.

Georgetown series

Pitt emerged victorious in its
series against Georgetown, collect-
ing two of the team’s tlnee wins
since concluding the semester.

Pitt sophomore Darmy Lopez slides into the plate last Week in Pitt's 9-1  against Cleveland State. Pitt,
which has 10 games remaining on its schedule, faces ‘Central Michigan and Coppin State this afternoon.

In game one of the series, Pitt
overwhelmed the Hoyas, downing
the conference foe at home, 9-2.

Sophomore southpaw hurler

‘Nate Reed pitched a gem, allow-

ing just three hits on his way to his

Pitt was just as impressive from

the dish, using a six-rim fourth in-
ning to pull away. Senior Sean
Conley was 2 for 5 on the day and
drove in two runs.

The next day, the Panthers kept

their bats alive en route to a 17-
11 victory in the ﬁrst game of the
doubleheader.

Williams starred for Pitt in the
triumph, blasting two home runs
to give him four on the season.

Panthers end hot, 1

play another day

by Adam Littman
Senior Staﬂ WrL'[er

After wrapping up the regular season.

over theweekend, the Pitt softball team has
something to look forward to: more games.
With a school—record 12 Big East wins

‘on the year, the Panthers (31-24, 12-10 Big

East) qualiﬁed for the Big East tournament
for the third straight season.
Since the end of the semester, the team

- went 7-7, the most recent of the matchups
' being a split of a doub1e—header against No.

23—ranked DePaul.

6 The Panthers now facethat same Blue '

Demon team in the ﬁrst round of the Big
East tournament tomorrow in Louisville,

_ Ky., at 12:30 p.m.

Pitt 5, Seton Hall 4

The Pirates scored in the top of the ﬁrst
inning to take an early lead, but a solo home
run by Reba Tutt in the bottom of the third
knotted it up.

Seton Hall bounced back to take a 4-1
lead with three more runs in the top of the

_ ﬁfth, but that lead wouldn’t last long.

In the bottom of that inning, a single
from Jessica Dignon drove in Tutt and a
three—rur1 homer by Mary Hecker gave Pitt
the 5-4 advantage and the win.

Pitt 5, Seton Hall 2

The Panthers swept the Pirates thanks in
part to Sam Card, who went 3 for 3 on the
game with a solo home run, two runs scored
and two RBIs. _

Kayla Zinger pitched a complete game,
giving up two runs on ﬁve hits.

Pitt 5, St. John’s 2 ,

It was a record-tying day at Trees Field
when Cory Berliner earned her 15th win of
the year to tie the school record.

Berliner is also the ﬁrst pitcher in school
history to win more than 11 games as a
freshman. -

The Panthers earned their 10th Big East
victory, also tying a. school record.

Another Card home run drove in two in
the ﬁrst inning, while Berliner went the dis-
tance, only giving up two runs on six hits.

St. John’s 2, Pitt 0 .

Zinger pitched another complete game,
giving up two runs on 10 hits over seven
innings, but this time ended up on the los-
ing end. ~ ‘

An RBI-single in the fourth inning and

a solo home run in the sixth were the only
runs scored during the game. .

Syracuse 5, Pitt 3

The Panthers dropped the ﬁrst game of

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.comA

their doubleheader, it didn’t come without

some good. In the loss, Dignon set a school 1

record by hitting her 42nd career double.

. After falling behind by one, the Panthers
took a 3-1 lead in the bottom of the second
inning but couldn’t hold on.

The Orange added two runs in the fourth .
-and two more in the sixth to earn the 53 i

win.

Syracuse 2, Pitt 1

Despite a late—game threat by the Pan-
thers, the Orange completed the sweep.

vWith one out in the seventh, Megan Li-
vesey doubled to bring the tying run to the
plate. Kelly Stiles then hit a rocket deep to

left, which bounced off the tip of the out— ,

ﬁelder’s glove and barely stayed in the park,
resulting in a double.

Livesey scored to cut the deﬁcit in half, 
‘but Stiles was stranded at second to end the

game.

Pitt 11, Youngstown State 3

Backed by two home runs from Card,
the Panthers easily disposed of Youngstown
State. “

Card hit a two—run homer in the bottom

of the ﬁfth to give Pitt some-cushion on its '

one—run lead, then blasted a three-run shot in X

«the sixth to help put the game out of reach.

Card ﬁnished the game with two hits, as
did Hecker and Kelly Murphy. Dignon went
3-3‘ with three RBIs and three runs scored.

Pitt 8, Youngstown State 2 '

The Panthers completed the blowout
sweep thanks to a complete—garne four—hit—
ter from Alyssa O’Conne1l. 

It was the freshman’s ﬁrst career vic-

tory.

The-Penguins’ two runs came on a hom-

er in_the ﬁrst, but O’Conne1l settled down,

only giving up two more hits.

The Panthers tied the game in the fourth '

Pitt took the series, but the loss in game three
proved unsettling.

"‘It really bothers me that we didn’t
sweep,” said Conley. “I think we’re a better
team.”

Kent State 9, Pitt 2 . ;

The Panthers took to the road for a one-
game series but didn’t receive many happy
returns, falling 9-2 to the Golden Flashes.

Pitcher Mike Wood took the loss, while

shortstop Danny Lopez and catcher Nick

Mullins knocked in the only two Panther
runs.

Conley and Matt Litzinger recorded two
hits apiece. S

Pitt 9, Cleveland State 1

After being battered in one nonconfer-
ence game, the Panthers found solace in a
9-1 beatdown of Cleveland State under the
lights at Trees Field.

Lopez and Mullins launched homers to
lead the Panther onslaught.

Freshman pitcher Kevin Dooley notched
his ﬁrst career win, striking out ﬁve in as
many innings and allowing just three hits.

Villanova Series _ 3

The Panthers’ return to conference play
proved rocky as they lost three straight
games on the road to Villanova. pp

Pitt dropped a heartbreaker in game one,

falling victim to a walk-off home run by ;

Wﬂdcat Kyle Carver.

’ Mullins continued his offensive hot
streak with a two-RBI triple to tie the game
in the eighth inning before the walk-off
shot. 2 

The series took an ugly tum from there,
with Villanova butscoring the Panthers 24-
14.

Williams, from nearby Berwyn, Pa., said
playing at Villanova was like a “home game”
for him. Still, it couldn’t stop the Panthers’
slide. 2

runs from Lopez, Williams, Litzinger and
