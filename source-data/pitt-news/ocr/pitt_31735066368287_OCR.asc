' Men’s Volleyball, Women’s Field Hockey Eliminated

By MARK A. SINDLER

The Pitt athletic department
announced yesterday that two pro-
grams are being cut due to a lack of
money.

Athletic director Edward Bozik
said the decision to eliminate
men's volleyball and women's field
hockey was made after 18 months
of discussion. The plan was
approved by Chancellor Wesley
Posvar, Vice-Chancellor Jack Free-
man and the University Senate.

“We were acting on recommen-
dations from the university athletic
committee last year. when Cas
(former athletic director Casimir
Mylinski) was here. We were faced
with a funds reduction in the
athletic department, and those
were reductions I had to live up
to,” Bozik said. I

“ I could have lowered the levels
of all sports, but I chose to improve
on what we have. It is ‘not an easy
decision by any means, but it
involves considered and measured
judgement.”

Bozik further explained that the
final terminations were not “snap
decisions.” “After the athletic com-
mittee appointed a separate com-

' ‘mittee, it predicted that there will

be no increase in the budget next

year and that we had to concentrate
our resources,” he said.

“I was faced with the responsi-
bility of cutting the budgets of the
two programs because neither has
scholarships and there are no com-
mittments to the student-athletes.”

The first-year director also said
there was a lengthy investigation of
the factors involved in what he
calls “varsity sports” levels of com-
petitiveness, travel costs, recruiting
possibilities and popularity.

“Across the country,” Bozik said,
“there are similar reductions being
made; so essentially, it is being
done with a sense of logic."

Wheh Bozik was appointed
athletic director this summer, he
and Posvar presented a formal
commitment to giving non-
revenue sports strong support. Des-
pite this decision, Bozik said he is
standing by those remarks.

“I am here to improve the qual-
ity of varsity sports,” he said. “But
seeing that I am given limited
resources and still improve the
quality, I have to act accordingly.

“I could have spread the resour-
ces more thinly. But that’s not con-
sistent with trying to improve
quality‘.”

Posvar agreed with Bozik.

“This decision is clearly a rein-
forcement of our previous commit-

ment (to non-revenue sports),”
Posvar said.

Bozik and his department were
faced with two options for accom-
modating a required 3 percent

  
   

decrease in the fiscal sports budget
that amounts to approximately
$30,000. The athletic administra-
tion's second option was to cut

programs. With the cuts, there will
be eight women’s sports and 11
programs for men. _

Players Surprised By Action

By MARK A. SINDLER

It was as if a storm had hit them
by surprise-—news of the men's vol-
leyball and women’s field hockey
teams funds being cut from the
athletic department.

“I couldn’t see how, not with all
this money coming into the pro-
gram,” volleyball player Barry
Goldberg said. “All I see is the Cot-
ton Bowl.” That was what the
athletic department yesterday
based its program-cutting decision
on—the reduction of incoming
funds and the draining effects of
present inflation.

Faced with a three percent
decrease ultimatum, the depart-
ment did not have any other
recourse; a situation, associate
athletic director Dean Billick said,

allocations in each of the 21 sports

that is prevalent across the country.

“Other athletic departments
have the same problem across the
country,” Billick said. “We have
made many other cuts in the
department and have not had our
scholarship funding increased over
the last seven years.”

“In fact, it’s been decreased. But
we still have to absorb tuition
hikes, increases in housing costs
and inflation that has eaten away at
our budget."

He refused to go into detail on
the other cuts in the department.

Billick said that the department
just cannot cut back anymore and
that the overall funding reductions
occurring over the previous five-
year span can no longer take place.

“It would be unfair to sports pro-
grams to take anymore,” he said.
“There would be no competition.”

Billick said that numerous tac-
tors were considered before certain
teams were dropped from the fiscal
budget. He cited such aspects as
scholarship aid, the costs involved
in operating these teams, the inter-
est generated for the sports team
and success in the. won-loss
column.

Fifth-year volleyball coach Ray
Reilly, does not know what more
he could have accomplished to be
viewed as successful.

“My budget has been the same
for the last three years, and (the
administration) said. this would
not hurt my kids," he said. Yet we
are No. 2 in the East right now.

“I have also had several players
named All—East, which is equival-
ent to All-America since no such
thing exists in volleyball. »We have

More Dorm Space

To Be Available

By RAY WUSLICH

Because Pitt housing officials
are concerned that some students
may walk out on their housing
contracts in the winter term, ‘the
Housing Office has advertised the
availability of dormatory space,
according to director of housing
Donovan Hughes. '

“The number of individuals
interviewing to terminate their
housing contracts for the winter
term is down for last year,” Hughes
said.~“We are making the optimis-
tic assumption that there are
simply fewer people who wish to
leave. But, in the event that this
assumption turns out to be wrong
we want to make sure that there are
people to fill the vacancies."

Although the housing contract
is legally binding, Hughes said
that the university would probably
not enforce it.

Enrollment at Pitt has been sta-
ble and the residence halls have
been filled to capacity, with some
students living in lounges on many
floors. According to Hughes the
number of students who will be
graduating is also down this year_
from last winter term, and the

mnxigtsxaeétsmitmstsnimsbswsitins

‘ living in

list for university housing is down
by 75 students from last year. The
Housing Office is not sure at this
time how many spaces will be
available in the winter.

If occupancy in the residence
halls falls below 97 percent the uni-
versity could lose money on them,
Hughes said.

“The university budgets for a
nominal vacancy rate in the
dorms,” Hughes said. “We have to
consider unforeseen situations.
There is always the possibility that
a student may drop out because of
some personal difficulties such
illness or the death of a parent.”

There are 4,200 beds in Pitt's dor-
matories. If 126 of them are empty
the university will just about break
even on its housing facilities.

In order to avoid this possibility
the Housing Office has placed full
page ads in several issues of The
Pitt News encouraging students to
consider the alternative of univer-
sity housing. The Housing Office
has done this in the past to inform
students when housing may be
available.

“I think students are better off
the residence halls,”‘

By BILL HESS

Last month, conferences con-
cerning the threats posed by
nuclear weapons were held at over
500 colleges in the United States,
including the University of

Pittsburgh.

" As was reported, student interest
in these convocations was minimal
across the country, prompting the
question, “Do college students
ignore the threat of nuclear war?”

This week’s Forum tries to
answer this question.

John Werkmeister says that
while he personally is concerned
with the possibility of nuclear war,
most students try not to think
about it.

“I don’t know if it's an effort to
ignore the threat or the lack of an
effort to think about it, as with pov-
erty,” he said.

Werkmeister said recent demon-

strations have helped increase stu-

dent awareness of the problem “to
a limited effect.”

“If students read in the paper
everyday that there’s another arms
race conference being sponsored by
some group, then they’ll realize
that something is at least going
on,” he said. a

The best way to get Pitt students
motivated about the problem
would be to “initiate governmental
nuclear testing on Flagstaff Hill,.”
said Werkmeister. »

The Pitt News, Friday December 3, I982

FORUM:  

Do College Students

As to whether or not the nuclear
dilemma is understood by students,
Werkmeister said it’s impossible to
put all students into the same class.

“it varies with the individual,
because while some people are
afraid of any threat, others are
skeptical about one like this,” he
said. “Some people may think it’s a
type of conspiracy where the
government is trying to show that
defense spending is the only way to
maintain peace."

Werkmeister says he disagrees
with the notion that thenuclear
threat is destroying student enthu-
siasm and hope for the future.

“I don’t see that happening. Any
type of moral or social movement
which is prevalent now wouldn’t
be responsive to the fear of an
Armageddon,” said Werkmeister,
adding that students today are
enthusiastic about what is really
important to them.

MOLLY RUSH, NUCLEAR DIS-
ARMAMENT ACTIVIST

Molly Rush, a peace activist and
frequent guest-lecturer in Pitt
classes, says that college students
“try their best to ignore the nuclear
threat, like most of us.”

Rush, who works at the Merton
Center, which she describes as “a
ministry for peace,” said the issue
is particularly hard to deal with for
college students. “They must pre-
pare for a future when there may
not be any future,” she said.

Ho/land Hall Drive

‘, By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

The seventh floor of Holland
Hall is completing its required
floor project for this semester as
well as helping some needy
families in the community.

The Resident Student Associ-
ation (RSA) is finishing a pro-
ject, sponsored by Holland
Hall's seventhfloor, to collect
canned gods to be distributed to
various families in Oakland.

Several residents of Holland’s
seventh floor went from door-
to—door throughout all of Hol-
land North and South last night
and Wednesday night. On Wed-
nesday alone they had collected

' over 250 items.

They are working with the
Bellefield Presbyterian Church
and St. Paul’s Cathedral in
Oakland, both of which have
programs to help needy
families.

The housekeeper for Holland
Hall's seventh floor originally
thought of the idea and sug-
gested it to the resident assistant
on that floor, who in turn pro-
posed it to RSA.

“We thought it would be a
good project mainly because we
don’t lose money on it,” said
Bev Sheridan, RSA representa-
tive for the seventh floor.

Hughes said, “but it's not for
everyone.”

Hughes said that the security
and convenience of living on cam-
pus make it an attractive alterna-
tive to living off campus.

“There have been students who
lived in the dorms, moved out, and
after a year to two they wanted to
move back in.”

Students who move into the
dorms in the winter term will also
be eligible to participate in the
room selection lottery for next'fall.

“We don’t make a prtﬁit from
it but we don’t lose any money,
either.”

Sheridan pointed out that not
only does the floor have to
endure any expenses, but this
project is cheaper for the uni-
versity as well.

“For other hall projects,” she
said, “a lot of time money has to
be taken from the school’s
budget for supplies and stuff.
This was completely free.”

Sheridan was very pleased
withthe response that the pro-
ject received from other Hol-
land residents.

“The girls were really willing
to donate,” she said.

Ignore The Nuclear War Threat?

The problem, she said, is not one
of apathy, but one of helplessness.
“I think ‘apathy’ is too weak ofa
term. People are immobilized
instead of uncaring," she said.
“Historically though, when peo-

ple begin to get really aroused,"

things get changed."

I Rush said that it is important for
students to get aroused over the
issue, especially since they are the
leaders of the future.

V “If any of us ignore the problem,
it’s not going to go away. Students
should realize that ignoring this is
its own worse peril," she said.

Rush said one hopeful sign for
her is that student groups are
beginning to study the problem at
various campuses and that college
presidents are also getting
involved. While some students are
lost in confusion over the problem,
most “understand the basis of it,
that being how nuclear war can
extinguish life on the planet,” she
said.

As for ways of protesting the
arms race, Rush said that students
should go as far nonviolently as is
necessary to reverse the present
situation.

“It will take public demonstra-
tion, refusal to pay taxes and ref-
usal to register for the draft to stop
this system which threatens lives,”
she said.

ROBERT KRAUT, VISITING
ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF
PHILOSOPHY

Robert Kraut, a visiting profes-
sor from Ohio State University,
says he objects to the idea that stu-
dents can be put into a general cate-
gory concerning apathy toward the
nuclear issue.

Conference

Issues in higher education
will be the focus of a conference
entitled “Kaleidoscope IV,” to
be held on the Pitt campus Dec.
3 and 4. .

Twelve presentations will be
delivered on various higher
education issues on Dec. 4 from
9 a.m. to 12:15 p.m. in ROOYII
5]l0 Forbes Quad. .

The issues discussed will

“At some colleges, students are
very active politically and very
aware of what's going on, while at
other colleges people just sit
around waiting for the dam to
break,” he said. “Schools which are
more selectiveand have brighter,
more aware people in them are
likely to have people who are more
worried about‘ things which are
pretty awful and likely to happen.”

Kraut said a major factor deter-
mining whether a particular stu-
dent is concerned about the nuclear
issue or other political problems is

the type of family that student‘

comes from.

“In some homes, after the kids
put down the football they go
home to have dinner and discuss
politics ‘and religion, but then
there are there households in
which such questioning has been
stifled,” he said.

If the United States becomes
characterized by people who don’t
question problems such as the
nuclear issue and we continue to
build up our military while our
educational system crumbles, the
country will collapse, Kraut said.

“Stupid people are sitting ducks.

‘ If you want to attack a society, you

just wait until it crumbles from
within,” he said. “You «won't have
to drop a single bomb.”

Kraut said that students can be a
powerful force in shaping policy if
they actively oppose the arms race.
“Demonstrations can help the
problem because they show the leg-
islators how people fee]. If legisla-
tors don’t know what people are
thinking, they will do what they
themselves want to do and what
their friends want them to do. “Stu-
dents often doubt that their opin-

include; “Satisfaction of Job-
Related Needs of Nursing

Students."

ions can affect national policy (or
anything else, for that matter); but
this is a mistake." )

PETER BONACUSE, SENI-
OR/MECHANICAL ENGI-
NEERING

Peter Bonacuse says that since
college students have little control
over the nuclear arms situation,
they concern themselves with other
issues.

“I think students perceive the
threat very well, but I personally
think the possibility of nuclear war
in the near future between the Uni-
ted States and Russia is remote,
because neither one of them is
going to start a war,” said Bona-
cuse, adding that the threat of
nuclear disaster comes more from a
terrorist group or a small, rebel-
lious country.

As for demonstrations against
nuclear build-up and their effect
on students, Bonacuse said, “They
don’t make an appreciable differ-
ence because they aren’t well
attended by students."

“Nothing short of a country
actually dropping a bomb or a real
serious scare” will help change stu-
dent apathy over the issue, Bona-
(:use said. ‘

The nuclear dilemma affects stu-
dents only on “a subliminal level,
but not a conscious," Bonacuse
said, adding that he feels lack of
student concern isn’t a threat in
itself.

“First of all, our government
won't start a ‘nuclear war, and
secondly, students wouldn’t have
the power to change anything even
if they were concerned,” he said.
“As far as I can‘ tell, people my age
have little control over what's
going to happen.”

Opinion

F

A Matter
Of Attitudes

On the sidelines at the Pitt-Penn State football
game, a masked figure sported a T-shirt that pro-
claimed, “I Are On A Academic Scholarship Ta
Pitt.” Pitt has a poor reputation for academics, and
jokes like “if you can’t go to college, go to Pitt” are
only too popular.

It’s understandable when Pitt is the butt of jokes
by Harvard highbrows or Penn State partisans, but
surprisingly many of these cutting gems are issued
from the mouths of Pitt students. Pitt not only
suffers from ‘its reputation, but from its own self-
image.

That’s a bit surprising, considering the nationally
recognized programs at Pitt, particularly in philo-
sophy and library and information science. In these
areas Pitt has shown that it can provide quality
academic offerings.

Why, then, is Pitt so widely known for mediocrity?
It is because of our own attitudes, our own self-
image. The problem begins with the priorities of our
administration. Students cannot believe that Pitt is
primarily concerned to offer its students quality pro-
grams when the College of Arts and Sciences advis-
ing staff is cut while plans are drawn to install lights
at Pitt Stadium. Nor can they believe that their edu-
cational opportunities are improved when the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences,-in response to a declin-
ing budget, applies the fiscal knife to teaching posi-
tions, leaving research jobsunscathed.

In the next decade, public institutions, like Pitt,
are expecting many top high school seniors to opt
for their lower tuitions in place of the expensive
prestige of private schools. With its resources, Pitt is

V not a bad choice for the money. But just as football

coaches cannot recruit top talent to a team with a
losing spirit, so aschool cannot attract bright minds
if it insists upon its own inferiority. Yet, until last
year, Pitt made virtually no effort to attract students
with the distinctive programs it has to offer. Instead,
we only perpetuate that old joke, “if you can't go to
college....”

Pitt is an urban university whose aim is to provide
an affordable education to the Western Pennsylva-
nia community. It is no sin to make that a good
education at the same time. Pitt has many good
programs. Still more are possible, if the administra-
tion will recognize the need.

But the administration is not alone in carrying a
poor image of Pitt’s academics. Pitt students can
study with some of today's leading intellectual fig-
ures and still be convinced that they have received an
inferior education. Administrative action-
important as it is—can’t change our attitudes about
ourselves. S

Pitt students may feel insulted by that Penn State
fan’s T-shirt. But how can Pitt command the respect
of others if we, both administrators and students,
refuse to “respect ourselves?

published in The Pitt News on
Nov. 24, 1982, entitled, “Atrocities
in Iraq.” I would like to clarify cer-
tain facts that were‘ concealed
intentionally in order to mislead
the readers. It seems to me that the
writer intended to deceive the
American public through certain
false informations listed in his let-
ter primarily to divert their atten-
tion from the scandalous
imposture of the pro-Khomeini
Iranian group who misrepresented
themselves as the Islamic Union of
Iraqi Students (IUIS) on the cam-
pus recently. The acronym more
properly stands for “Islamic Union
of the Iranian Students,” not
“Iraqi Students,” simply because
the majority (if not all) of its
members are Iranian citizens or of
Iranian descent and definitely not
Iraqis.

To begin with, the writer identi-
fied himself in a very vague and
confusing manner as a “Moslem
student.” To my knowledge, a
“Moslem student” does not iden-
tify the country of origin. He could
be a Moslem from Malaysia, Pakis-
tan, Iran, Syria, Uganda, Niger or
even the United States of America.
This means that there is a great
possibility that he is not an Iraqi
citizen and, therefore, not in the
position to talk about the internal
affairs of a country to which he
does not belong.

In the best conditions, I can
deduce that the author is either an
Iranian (most probably) because of
the present conflict between Iraq
and Iran or an Iraqi of Iranian des-
cent. It is also a pertinent assump-
tion that the writer indicated was
in a fully conscious state and in a
good mental and emotional condi-
tion when he wrote his letter in
order to avoid any prejudice state-
ment in this commentary against
him. .

The “Moslem student" referred
to the July 17, 1968 revolution in
Iraq as a “bloody coup" which is a
totally false statement. It is a well-
known fact to all Iraqi people that
the 1968 revolution was a “peace-
ful, bloodless" uprising; hence, it
was described as the “White Revo-
lution." The deceased former Iraqi
President Ahmad Hassan Al-Baker
was elected and nominated as the
president of Iraq by the Arab
Socialist Baath Party which has the
vast majority among the Iraqi
people.

Al-Baker had to leave his posi-
tion because of ill health, but not
because of the so-called “Islamic
revolution," as the author claimed
l” hi5 19”‘-’l": l5  iiiiportziiit to clar-
ify what the “Moslem student" pre-

cisely meant by this term. It is a list
of corruptive and terroristic actions
planned and committed by the pro-
Khomeini agents in Iraq. The
word “Islamic” is given to such ii
conspiracy merely to imply a reli-
gious background and hence some
legitimacy. The following are
examples of their “struggle” and
“heroic" actions in Iraq and their
factitious revolution:

9 In 1980, duringastudent meet-
ing at the campus of the University
of Al-Mustansriah in Baghdad, a
bomb thrown by one of the Dro-

‘The lraniansmvvere relye
tant to identify themselves
because they were con-
cerned that their charade
would be discovered.’

-1m—I-I-2-in-III
Khomeini agents killed some of the

innocent students and injured oth-
ers. They described this action as
“struggle”, I call it terrorism.

7 0 Later in the same year,
another bomb thrown on a march-
ing parade of civilian people in
Baghdad injured and killed many
children and students. They called
that action “fighting forjustice”; I
call it an atrocious murder.

0 In July of 1982, an explosion
set in the Ministry of Planning in
Baghdad killed or injured more
than a 100 civilians. They called it
“heroic action”; I call it barbaric
crime.

0 Sabotage was inflicted on sev-
eral industrial and constructive
institutions in the country.

The- author said in his letter,
“Al-Baker jailed, tortured and exe-
cuted all dissidents, including
many scholars..." I wonder how
such a fanatic pro-Khomeini gang
can be treated differently in coun-
tries other than Iraq for their des-
tructive practices and crimes? I

be considered as “atrocities” or
“massive execution” as the “Mos-
lem student” tried to imply?

A comparison between the Iraqi
revolution in 1968 and the Iranian
revolution in 1979, which was
designed to be exported to the
neighboring countries, ‘would be a
better and more accurate parameter

for the Americans and all peace-,.M

loving people around the world

people in Iran have been massacred
since the early days of the Iranian
revolution. Consequently, Iranian
national minorities have escalated
their struggles in various parts of
Iran to attain their national rights.

The Iraqi revolution since the

early ‘70s nationalized its own oil '

resources, improving the socio-
economical status of every Iraqi
citizen. Tremendous construc-
tional and industrial programs are
being instituted in the country.

importer of oil products. The revo-
lution also put forth an excellent
program to eradicate the illiteracy
in the country. The success of that
program was recognized by an
international prize in 1978.

The fascist Iranian regime, on
the contrary, set up a horrible pro-
gram to eradicate its opponents.

Sick, Tired And Apathetic

Dear Editor:

I, for one, am sick and tired of
the complaints circulating on
college campuses that students
don’t care about anything

P-~ today. Of course we don't! And

why should we? Speaking as the
head of the League of Apathetic
Students (we’re too lazy to
become an officially recognized
student organization), I defend
the right to live an apathetic
life.

Students do not have the time
to worry about the events taking
place outside of their personal
sphere. The sagging economy
forces many students to work
while they attend classes, and
this seriously affects their study
and leisure time. Who has the
time to protest? Grave personal
questions such as: “How am I
going to pay for school?” or
“Do I have enough money to
buy another pitcher of beer?" or
“Who was that masked man?”
dominate larger issues such as
nuclear war, student aid cuts
and the location of Albania.

Sure, one can protest against
these issues, but what good does
it do? If 800,000 people attend-
ing an anti-nuclear arms rally
in New York City can’t get a rise
out of Uncle Sam, then how can
organized students get a

response? O.K., you're right.
Students can organize, but this
requires them to give up leisure
time. The pressures of college
life, especially today, make leis-
ure time a highly valued com-
modity. This is why bars draw
more people than demonstra-
complaining and attack the
lem, to which there exists a sim-
ple solution. Groups that want
to organize rallies should pro-
vide the_participants with free
alcoholic beverages. I'm sure
that attendance at these rallies
would increase dramatically.
Even apathetic students like
myself (whose slogan pro-
claims: “Drop the bomb. We
don't give a  would attend.
I urge all members of the
League of Apathetic students
(and anyone else who wishes to
participate) to take part in a
symbolic gesture of approval at
2:00 tomorrow afternoon. At
that time, all members should
clench both their fists extend-
ing the middle fingers, turn
toward our nation's capitol and
raise both hands above their
heads while screaming the first
four letters of the notorious
“fish cheer.”
Case closed.

It’s Like Playing Chicken

Dear Editor:

I can walk in a perfectly normal
way, but due to a back injury, I
cannot run or even jog. It’s physi-
cally upsetting every day to try to
cross Fifth and Bigelow and Forbes
and Bigelow. It’s so unfair! There
are no definite walk signs and no
safe times to cross free of traffic.
Pedestrians, therefore, are forced to

 

walk out in front of cars and stop
the cars themselves.

It’s like a cruel game. Students
who need to cross to the Cathedral
and back are forced to play
“chicken” with turning cars and
hope that a big enough group of
students crosses with them. As a
result, there are always bad tempers
and glares from the drivers. Many
drivers purposely gun it, some rev
their motors, some yell at students
and some just honk.

I can’t run to get out of the way,
so it’s even worse forme. I’m forced

ture and repression are characteris-
tic features of this awkward regime.
The Zionist attack on the Iraqi
nuclear installations by the Ameri-
can made F-15 and F-16 warplanes
last year is an indication for the
deep concern of the Israeli of the
Iraq’s future as an effective power
in the region. However, the contin-
uous and unlimited Israeli arms
supply to the Iranian regime to sus-
tain its aggressive war against Iraq
is strong evidence for the suspi-
cious nature of this regime and its
close ties to the Zionist state of
Israel. This fact which cannot be
denied by the “Moslem student” or
his masters in Tehran, is already
confirmed by the former Iranian
President Bani Sadr, the leader of
Iranian opposition Rajavi and
even the Israeli officials
themselves.
Since Khomeini ascended to the
throne of the Shah in 1979, the
Iranian regime has persistently
sought to diffuse dissention among
Arab Moslems in neighboring
Arab countries, as well as among
Moslems in other countries. Under
the notorious policy of exporting
Islamic revolution from Iran to
other countries, Iranian rulers have
been, in fact. trying to export two
things: notions of dissention and
division among Moslems and sub-
versive materials to agents of_Ira-
nian nationality in other countries
‘as was the case in Iraq. The pre-

vious information and facts would,
undoubtedly, disclose the reality of
the situation in the area. In addi-
tion it would reveal the extent of
the disfigurement inflicted by the
so—called “Moslem student.”

The Iraqi students requested
that the pro-Khomeini group IUIS
should have identified themselves

and showed their passports as valid
 

‘The incident...was not
merely a conflict between
two groups of foreign
students.’

.-

and legitimate. This did not indi-

cate the Iraqi students as “agents”
as mentioned in the letter, but it
was the only way to prove or refute
the group’s claims of being Iraqi
students. The Iranians’ excuse that
they are afraid of their families in
Iraq being punished, is groundless
and absurd. As a matter of fact, they
were reluctant to identify them-
selves because they were concerned
that their charade would be dis-
covered. However, two members of
the group did mention their
names. Uiisurprisingly, neither
one has an Arabic name. Instead
both have evident Iranian names.
In addition, the pro-Khomeini
group was stunned when con-
fronted by the spoken Arabic
because Iranians are unable to
interpret Arabic.

 

Indeed, the incident of the
Forbes Quad, which was provoked
by the members of the unknown
IUIS, is not merely a conflict
between two groups of foreign stu-
dents at ‘the University of Pitts-
burgh, as one might think. It is the
sequel to the recent successive
defeats of the rotten Iranian regime
in its aggressive war against Iraq in
the battle zone. Itis strong evidence
of the political isolation and bank-
ruptcy of the regime’s head (Kho-
meini) and his figures. Moreover,
the hostile action against the Iraqi
students at Pitt and the paranoid
statements raised by this group

. clearly coincides with the psycho-
pathic nature of their motivating
rulers in Tehran.

As an Iraqi student at Pitt, I
believe that the situation should
not be ignored; rather, it must be
considered seriously. Any attempt
to liquidate the problem would
lead to inevitable bloodshed and
violence with this corruptive
group named IUIS in the future.
Both the Office of Student Activi-
ties and the group calling itself
“The Moslem Student Organiza-
tion" should be held responsible
for the incident and, consequently,
for the two stabbed Pitt students.
Further cooperation or per-mission
offered by the Office of Student
Activities to such a group will be
regarded as a sort of connivance
and an. inconsiderate action.

Tooth of Crime’:
l3i int! The
Big One

By CHRISTOPHER

Imagine an America where
middle class values and culture

, have completely broken down.

o

Imagine an entertainment
industry dominated by stars
who must show as much skill
with a Beretta automatic as
they do with a Gibson guitar.
Imagine an America where
hard drugs take thegplace of
Sara Lee coffee cake for enter-
taining friends when they drop
by. This is the America of The
Tooth of Crime, Sam Shepard’s
masterful fantasy piece which
weaves the poetry of rock’n’roll
in an intricate web with the
poetry of violence.

No Shepard play is a piece of
cake, but Tooth is particularly
demanding. And, sad, to say,
these demands are beyond the
abilities of director Matthew
Vaky, who mounted the cur-
rent production of Tooth at the
Pittsburgh Laboratory Theatre‘.

Like all fantasy, Tooth
demands a sense of belief and
reality from the artistsworking
in it. Without it, the play
becomes affected, self-
conscious and not a little silly.
Shepard’s language is densely
poetic, drawing much of its
imagery from '60s rock, rhythm
and blues, jazz and progressive
art. Vaky's actors seem to
simply not know what they're
talking about. The effect is like
watching bad Hollywood actors
trying to play hippies or beats
without any sense of the cul-
ture they are attempting to
portray. '

The central character of Tooth
is Hoss, an established star who
seems to have everything going

for him. As written, Hoss is a
sort of cross between the per-
sonalities of Keith Moon and
James Coburn. As played by
G.W. Rooney, he is about as
threatening and powerful as
Iohnny Mathis. Rooney cer-
tainly looks the part of Hoss,
decked out in black leather and
boots. But using that criterion,
there are a lot of male models
out there who could play
Hamlet. The truth is that Roo-
ney never seems to believe in
Hoss himself. And if he doesn't,
he certainly can't expect us to,
either. _
There are some good perfor-
mances in the cast; PLT regular
. Richard Cavalucci is fine as the
drug-dispensing Doc, and
Patrick Shea is a strong
Cheyenne, Hoss’ driver and
trigger man. Portia Kamons,
though, is stiff and unconvinc-
ing as Becky, Hoss’ number one
lady, and 17.]. Hartland is simply
embarrassing as the D.]., Galac-
tic lack.

' On the positive side (and yes,
there is one), there is one per-
formance that is so exciting and
alive it almost pulls Tooth's
bacon out of the fire. Douglas
Pona is nothing short of bril-
liant as Crow, the ”gypsy
killer” who operates outside
the official ”Code" to challenge
Hoss. Pona makes Shepard’s

come so alive it hits the
audience like a right cross. The
unpredictable shadings of his
voice and the startling grace of
his physical movements give
Crow a depth and complexity
sadly lacking in most of the
other performances. Pona does
not appear until the second act,
and he literally drivesit single
handedly.
Tooth is a musical, of sorts,
featuring a live rock band
onstage. The words and music
are by Shepard, who started his
career in the arts as a late '60s
rock and roller (He was the
drummer for Lothar and the
Hand People...remember them-
?...remember The Fugs?...re-
member...oh, never mind.).
Shepard’s music is straight
ahead, ‘no-nonsense rock, and
done justice to by Robert A.
Wagner, lead guitar; Gerry
Wasson, bass; Bill Oliver,
rhythm guitar; and Darrell
Jackson, drums. John Creigh-
ton plays piano and doubles on
C-melody sax (Where did he
find one?) and flute. Creight-
on’s horn work abets the pro-
ceedings, however, due to his
insistence on playing consist-
ently in a different key from the
rest of the band (To do him jus-
tice, there are a few numbers
where he is merely out of
tune.).
G.W. Rooney's vocals are

 
  

competent, but, as in his acting,
he is enormously oversha-
dowed by the formidable tal-
ents of Douglas Pona. Using the

same Shure mikes through the

same P.A. system, many of Roo-
ney's lyrics are garbled; Pona’s
powerful, subtly shaded voice
makes every word come
through with crystal clarity.
This is especially evident in the
"dueI”vscene between Hoss and
Crow, when they trade impro-
vised lyrical insults and dance

‘ moves over the band's driving

beat. The lyrics are vital to the
scene, but we can only hear

FOUR FILMS OP WOODY ALLEN
Random House

‘ Woody Allen

Random House has assembled four
.of Woody Allen's film scripts into one
pleasant volume: Annie Hall and Man-
hattan (both co—written with Marshall
Brickman) are love letters to New
York City; Interiors presents a bleak
picture of family life; Stardust Memories
examines the conflicting public and
private lives of a popular movie come-
dian. The films reveal Woody Allen's
perceptive views of the complications
and occasional rewards .of personal
relationships.

As his character Sandy Bates says
in Stardust Memories, "I think any rela-
tionship is not based on either com-
promise or maturity or any of that.
It's really based on luck." It's very
quotable stuff.

The book has been thoroughly
prepared—every "uh" and every‘
-stuttered or repeated word has been
duly noted. Italicized descriptions of
the action and non-verbal scenes are
provided by the publisher, and stills
from the movies illustrate the text.
The translation of certain cinemato-
graphic techniques—the split-screen
process, dream sequences, subtitles,
flashbacks and montage——is awk-
ward at times. Allen has departed
somewhat from the traditional
chronological format, particularly in
Annie Hall and Stardust Memories; a
reader who hasn't seen the films
might become confused.

It's certainly nostalgic if you have
seen the movies, though. You'll find
it difficult to read the scripts without
inserting Woody Allen or Diane Kea-
ton or Mariel Hemingway or Char—
lotte Rampling into their proper
places. For best results, go see the
films to get the visuals along with the
dialogue. But Four Films is nice memo-
rabilia for afterwards.

four men and their wives and the

roles they each play in directing or
effecting America's entry into space.
The title may mislead readers into
believing the novel is a space adven-
ture similiar to Star Wars or Star Trek;
yet, only the latter chapters deal with
man's orbits of the earth as well as as
the historic trips to the moon. The
unmanned voyages to Mars, Jupiter,
and Saturn are also portrayed.
Michener mixes factual characters
and historic events with fictional
characters and situations which con:
cern the births of atomic weaponry
and travel into space. The intermix-
ing of fact and fiction is handled in the

expert Michener style and does not
linger for hundreds of pages as the
author does so often in several of his
novels.

Character development is cleverly
interwoven with the historical
accounting of man's obsession with
space and reading the novel tends to
lean more to the historical non-
fiction versus science fiction.
Michener fans will find the book is in
the typical Michener style and will
welcome the relatively short novel as
far as this author is concerned.

IT SEEMED LIKE NOTHING
HAPPENED

Peter N. Carroll

Holt, Rinehart and Winston

It may have seemed like nothing

much went on in the '70s, at least
compared to the turbulent decade

that preceded it, but even less occurs
in It Seemed Like Nothing Happened; The
Tragedy and Promise of/lmerica in the 705.
It's a pop history lesson that will no
doubt-become required reading for
the aging social-reformer set.
Author Peter Carroll traces the
development of movements spawned
in the ’60s—Civil Rights, Women's
Liberation, anti—war——and explains
how they changed through the '70s,
some fulfilling their "promise," oth-
ers, for varied reasons, dissolving.
Unless you've never learned that
reform movements generally move
in cycles, this book will probably be
the least insightful thing you've read
all year. Did anyone really expect the
'60s to go on forever? It's kind of fun
to refresh your memory by reading
this book. Then again, a few back
issues of Life would do just as well.

MY LIFE

Henry Fonda and Howard
Teichmann

Signet Paperbacks

Henry Fonda's My Life is the result
of an "alliance" (his term) between
the actor, a tape recorder and sea-
soned biographer Howard Teich—
mann, who collected over 200 hours
of interview (Fonda's family and
friends participated, also), edited and
transcribed large portions of it and
added transitions and an introduc-
tory chapter. The result is a surpris-
ing, fascinating panorama of this
actor, Henry Jaynes Fonda, the tall,
thin, reticent fellow from Nebraska
who symbolizes a sort of American
hero.

It's an intimate and emotional
account. "I don't really like myself,”
he says. "Never have. People mix me
up with the characters I play."

.Poignant—the sort of honesty

expected from Henry Fonda. Tho-
rough and readable, the book is best
when Fonda—self-effacing and
unpretentious—is quoted at length
on Fonda. Teichmann wraps it up
neatly with necessary clarification
and summary details.

Reflecting on his career, Fonda
remarks, ”God! How many guys get

-the chance to work at what they want

for fifty years .7" My Life is an essential
for the Fonda fan and a nice addition
to any film buff’s library.

A LOVE STORY

Delacorte Press

"This is a tale of once upon a time in
the dim forgotten days when animals
could talk, when dog leashes were
made of sausages, when tailors mar-
ried princesses and children were
brought into the worlds by storks."
So begins The Swallow and The Tom Cat,
the yvitty and charmingly poignant
tale of doomed love.

Told in a refreshingly simple style,
Amado tells us of the Tom Cat who
fell in love with a Swallow and pres-
ents a surprisingly accurate and
sometimes acerbic assault on the
hypocrisies of racial and class injus-
tice. Though we would hesitate to
agree with the publishers in
announcing this work as the "favor-
ite gift between star—crossed lovers
everywhere," we would say that it

MY HARVARD, MY YALE
By Diana Dubois
Random House

Grab your 'gators, Mr. Sperry
"Three Layers” Top Siders—-a new
book is hot off the presses aimed
right at you. My Harvard, My Yale is a
shot in the arm to declining preps
around the nation, a virtual catalog of
alums you can idolize for years to
come and the second installment in
the Preppy Bible (the first being The
Preppy Handbook). Finally, Muffy and
Biff learn how to behave in college.

Actually, Ms. Dubois has gathered
some fine writers whose essays are
well—written and interesting. The
book consists of short pieces by 24
alumni of the two prestigious univer-
sities, who recount parts of the past
60 or so years and their experiences
as undergrads._,Author Diana Dubois
keeps it from becoming an advertise-
ment for the tw-o schools by including
liberal criticisms of life at the schools
as well as praise.

But, who cares? Dubois’ premise,
that Harvard and Yale undergrads
are representative of undergrads
around the nation, or of nation-wide
feeling, is fundamentally incorrect.

Harvard and Yale students are the
best and the brightest (and usually
the richest) of our nation. Because of
this, they don't have too much in

common with undergrads at Pitt, or
UCLA, or farmers in Iowa or retirees
in St. Pete.

The book is interesting, if you
enjoy reading about the upper crust
of Cambridge and New Haven
society. The criticisms of how women
were treated in the 1940s and '50s are
good, as are the reflections on what
the two schools have become today.

Unfortunately, the subject of the
book is too alien to most of us. There
will be some pseudo-"Harvard" peo-
ple who'll rave over it, but, for most
of us, in a time of unemployment and
dwindling financial aid, My Harvard,
My Yale and its price tag are like a
copy of The National Enaairer—it's neat
to look at, but not -too practical.

LOVE LIFE

SCENES WITH IRENE
Roswitha Hecke
Grove Press

Though superbly photographed
and visually stunning as a piece of
erotica or a realistic study of life as a
prostitute, Love Life, Scenes with Irene is
ju-st oh-too-good, oh—too-glossy to be
true. A pictorial study of a street-
walker's life in Zurich and Rome, the
camera focuses only on those details
which make the prostitute’s life
appear to be a gratifying profession-
sexy poses, flashy costumes and the

supposed freedom of being "sexually,

free." We know selling one's self for
sex just isn't as glamorous as this
book suggests.

Even the cynical remarks of Irene
herself-to say nothing of the chauv-
inistic quotes by Baudelaire which are
scattered here and there through-
out—do nothing to dispel the myth
that women love sex and every wom-
an's a whore at heart. Isn't this 1982?

THE PLAYBOY INTERVIEWS
Various authors
Playboy Press

How would you like to spend the
upcominglholidays with Mel Brooks
or Jimmy Carter? How about Dolly
Parton, Marlon Brando or James Earl
Ray? Playboy Press gives you that
opportunity with its new book con-
taining 29 of Playboy magazine's best
all-time interviews.

Playboy first began its popular series
of interviews with some of the
world's leading personalities in 1962
when Roots author Alex Haley's inter- '
view with the controversial jazz
musician Miles Davis appeared. T..e
magazine had rigid standards in the
early interview years regarding the
subjects interviewed and the’ format
by which the interviews were

published.

The interviews have recountered
historic moments and events and
have in several cases been the last
recorded statements of individuals
who died shortly before or after the
interviews were published.

For all those persons who have
heard about some of the famous Play-
boy interviews, this is a Christmas
present that offers the chance to
again read or read them for the first
time.

Along with Brooks, Carter, Parton,
Brando, Davis and Ray, the other
interviews in the book include Ber-
trand Russell, Helen Gurley Brown,
Malcolm X, Albert Schweitzer, Vla-
dimir Nabokov, Cassius Clay/Mu-
hammed Ali (two interviews),_Mar-tin
Luther King, Jr., Madalyn Murray,’
George Lincoln Rockwell, Timothy

Richard Butler's Smoking Interpretation Of

The Psychedelic Furs

By FRANK DIGIACOMO

Yet, this atmosphere of ambiguity that Butler
exudes is the same stuff that fuels the lyrics to
his songs and makes the Psychedelic Furs tick. "I
don't like to make my songs actually clear to
everybody else because I think people should use
their own imaginations a little bit. That's basi-
cally the message of the Psychedelic Furs," he
says. "For me to come out and do something
very simple in a narrative would be against what
the band's about."

Butler stresses the points that he and the Furs
are out to make people's brains work and that it's
too easy to be blatant. "So," he says, "I don't
come out and put myself on a little platform,
like, say, the Clash might do, and make them-
selves politically clear. I like to work from inside
people's heads outwards and let them put their
own bit in."

True, Butler easily admits to being political,
and it was this need for expression that eventu-
ally led him to rock and roll. However, his first
attempts at self-statement were steeped in his
rather extensive training as an artist—an endea-
vor with which he soon became disenchanted. "I
was basically trying to do, in silkscreenlprints
and lithographs, what the P5 chedelic Furs are

It's been about 45 minutes since the Psyche-
delic Furs left the marble—encased stage at
Heaven. The dance mixes of Bananarama's "He
W-as Really Sayin' Something” and Yazoo's
"Don't Co" are still pulsing through the crowd
as the club begins to empty. Downstair's, guita-
rist John Ashton is wandering around the dance
floor and talking to anyone who cares to con-
verse, while drummer Phil Calvert is telling a
local musician how to mike her drumset. Some-
one recognizes him from his former group,
Birthday Party, and something close to hell
‘breaks loose. Tim and Richard Butler are
nowhere to be found. ‘ I

Backstage, cellist Ann Sheldon and saxopho-
nist Gary Window are clowning around with the
various bystanders and roadies. Tim Butler
skulks out of the plaster long enough to grab a
beer—only to discover that it's Iron City. He
makes a disgusted face and replaces the bottle.
Brother Richard is still nowhere in sight.

Then Butler suddenly appears, his ultra-thin
frame glides across the room and into the make-
shift dressing room against which I'm leaning. I
follow. A

The first thing that draws one to Richard
Butler's face are his eyes. They areangry eyes,
still dark with hunger. They stare—you try to .
look at his whole face, but you keep focusing 0‘
his pupils. It's like staring in_te the eyes of Chris
topher Lee in one of those Hammer vampire 
films——you're justwaiting for the fangs.

The rest of Butler's face is a paradox. His
features are thin and childlike, and his slightly
hunched posture suggests that he might at any
moment slip into the fetal position, in which he
might conjure up some more scathing lyrics for
the Psychedelic Furs’ next album. Watching him
sitting there, cross-legged, wrapped in a black
leather jacket, smoking feverishly, you're struck Z
with a creeping sense of ambivalence. You '
wonder if Butler is some sort of child prodigy
masquerading as an adult.

So I went for it."

trying to do now," he says. "I just got pissed off
that the message was much more difficult to get
over when you've only got a flat surface as com-
pared to the 3-D surface of the stage and the
Furs’ music—it's much more of an immediacy.

It is no wonder then that Butler's songs, like
his silkscreens, are full of real and surreal
images. From the mystical visions of"India," (off
the Furs’ first album) to the most recent Americ-
anistic reflections of "President Gas" (on Forever
Now), Butler has found a way to set his litho-
graphs, crammed full of images, to music. On
the third alum, though, his songs have taken on
a more orderly form than the almost schizoph-
renic panoramas of the first two releases. Butler
attributes this to a different style of songwrit- V
ing. "At first, I was working in a way where you
use images to create emotions," he explains.
"Where nowadays, I'm working in narrative, as
well, but still retaining the abstract images. It
became too easy to be totally abstract all the
time-——you know, you can write any kind of
drivel and get away with it; not that I was doing

More often than not, Butler's imagery spews
orth anger and sarcasm that's as gentle as a

«tux;

x

pickax in the back of the skull. He maintains that
his rage is by no means a sham and that his
extensive use of irony and sarcasm is a result of

‘(it being disillusioned. "I just think irony, or the use

“bf irony, is a symbol, if you like, of a disillusioned
idealist,” he says. "You wouldn't bother being
ironic or sarcastic if you weren't disillusioned in
some respect. I consider myself an idealist.”

In addition to his idealistic attitude, Butler
feels a lot of responsibility towards the audience,
especially when they're buying the Furs’
records. "You've got the option to make people
think instead of singing about how your girl-
friend left you...and I think that's an option that
this band uses where not many do," he states
nonchalantly, lighting another cigarette.

It is this statement of purpose that affords a

an album I don't think we can improve on, I'll

glimpse of the band's artistic stance. The Psy-
chedelic Furs have never rushed headlong into
the mainstream of fashion; rather, they've toyed
with its promising aspects while remaining on
the perimeter——and have still amassed a fanati-
cal following. Butler feels that it is their attempt
to give the audience something substantial to
grasp that has helped gain the Furs such a strong
following. He emphasized the band's attitude,
saying, "We give them something to think about
instead of, 'Yeah, let's wear these clothes this
week.’ "

While constantly avoiding the myriad trends
that sweep the U.K. and the U.S., the Psyche-
delic Furs have also refused to stagnate. Butler
admits that he has never been satisfied with the
music released on the previous albums, but adds
that he doesn't expect to be. "As soon as I make

kick it in the head," he smiles.

Along with the constant desire for improve-
ment comes great change, and the Furs’ third
album, Forever Now, saw this manifested in both
style and personnel. Butler sacked guitarist
Roger Morris and saxophonist Duncan Kilburn
before the third album was recorded (Vince Ely
left after the album was finished and was
replaced by Calvert). In addition, former pro-
ducer Steve Lilywhite was dropped in favor of
Todd Rundgren.

"We chose Todd because we'd changed the
lineup of the band, and we were writing songs
that had a more melodic structure. Conse-
quently, we wanted someone who could bring
out melody,” he explains. "Todd is eminently
famous for that."

At this point, a combination of Butler's
fatigue, boredom and general dislike for journal-
ists begins to gnaw at his patience, taking form
in the tiny barbs among his replies. At one point,
when asked if he is obsessed with the Furs,
Butler, who has already smoked about six
cigarettes in this short time span, replies that
the only thing he is obsessed with is "getting out
of this room." I look to his eyes for a sign of
truth, and I see a hint of iciness in the stare. I
realize that it is almost time to go.

Nevertheless, I try to push a little further and
ask him if his songwriting has been influenced
by anyone, especially Bowie. Butler doesn't
think so—at least not any more. "When you first
start a band, it's very difficult to come straight
out and do something original because you're
influenced by stuff you've heard before...and
you use it as reference points," he says. "But
once you've done one album, you tend to--once
you go out and make the second album—look at
what you've done yourself, so that by the time
you get to the third album, you're developing
yourself even more."

Naturally, with three albums behind them,
:he spectre of commercial success has obviously
been seen by the band members. However,
Butler isn't overly concerned with it. He insists
that the Psychedelic Furs will never chase in
audience, adding, "I'd hate to wake up and be an
REO Speedwagon. What does it take to be com-
mercially successful? If you can't do it on your
uwn leiuls, du yuu really want is db’ it? I dun’:

want to do it anyone else's way," he finishes. "I'd;

rather get a job working in a pizza place or
something.”

With that, Richard Butler has had enough. No
one has any more cigarettes, and he seems to be
constantly shifting his eyes towards the exit. As
I pick up my notes, I cautiously ask him if he has
any ultimate goal in life. He pauses for a moment

and says he's still working that one out. He does .

attempt to give me some form of an answer.

"I think the purpose——in fact, I said it earlier
is to make people think for themselves. Don't
follow leaders; follow the people who have been
saying it for years," he explains. "As for myself,
personally I think that when people get older,
they tend to go chasing wild religions because
they find life isn't satisfying in itself. I would like
to find it satisfying in itself."

SAGA/PAT BENATAR
November 29
Civic Arena

By GEORGE/HOLZER

”The First Lady of Rock” that is
how Pat Benatar is billed; the concert
on Monday night did nothing to dis-
prove the title.

When Benatar hit the stage
dressed in a black mini skirt and
leather jacket, the crowd roared its
approval, yet remained seated. Pat
ripped through "Treat Me Right”
”No You Don’t,” "Fire And Ice,” and
”Anxiety (Get Nervous)” without
stopping to take a breath. The best of
Pat followed——"Out-A-Touch,””You
Better Run,” ”Precious Time,” "We
Live For Love,” ”Hit Me With Your
Best Shot .” and ”Heartbreaker." The
house came alive when she left the

‘stage; the people wanted more, much

more.’ Pat returned clad in a Pitts-
burgh Spirit shirt with BENATAR 1

on the back. The first encore was
three songs, ”The Victim,” ”Heat Of
The Night.” and the child abuse
anthem, "Hell Is For Children.” Once
more, the band left the stage only to
be recalled for a final encore ”Little
Paradise.”

Benetar and boys sounded much
better than they did last year; the
addition of keyboards, in place of
Scott Sheets on rhythm guitar, was a
great move. Pat danced and moved
freely over the stage—also an
improvement over her last %_
appearance.

Saga, the opening act, was ignored
for the most part. They are not a
great band, but they tried hard and
were rewarded with some applause
for ”Wind Him Up" and ”We’re On
The Loose,” but were denied the
chance to perform an encore.

Benatar fit the ideal concert mold.
All involved had a good time; I know
of at least one non-believer who was
converted by this show.

H20 GOES BACK

TO THE WELL

H20
Daryl Hall‘ & Iohn Oates
RCA

Consider that Daryl Hall and
John Oates’ last two albums
have spit out no less than eight,
count 'em, Top 20 singles, and
one might say they've struck a
nerve. Why? A lot of it has to do
with the fact that when you've
been in the business of making
records for as long as these two
have, you tend to get real good
at it. After listeningto H2 O, one

"might say too good.

I know, the "play it-record it-A
press it" days of record making
are history. Nowadays, you
have to bounce ideas around,
experiment, do it this way, then
that way, toy with the technol-
ogy, then reproduce all of that
to exacting perfection. Great!
HZO has so many touches to it;
overdubs, echos, synthesizers
in every nook and cranny, all
neatly arranged and mixed that
I hate to play the damn record. I
feel as if I should just hold it up
to the light and marvel at how it
all fits into those tiny grooves.

This isn't to suggest that the
material is any less infectious

than say Private Eyes. There are
easily three or four hits on this
LP. ”Maneater" has already
attained that status with its
bouncy echoing beat and
Motown rhythms; also, look for
"Guessing Games," driven by
Hall's full throttle vocal, to soon
follow.

But wait a minute, this duo
has put in hard time—ten to fif-
teen with other people's ideas
and musicians—to finally
become a travelling, self-
contained, rock-n-roll band ,
and then they studio-ize their
record? Take guitarist G.E.
Smith, “ex-Bowie sessionman,
he could get other work if he's
not needed here.

The band's presence is felt on
only two rockers, meaning
songs least likely to cross over
to black radio. "Open All
Night," a lushly orchestrated
exchange between Hall's raspy
soul-tones and Oates’ eerie fal-
setto, allows Smith to unleash
his Stratocaster, and suddenly,
all those keyboard bleeps are
forgotten. "Family Man" is the
other instance of band
members, this time rhythm sec-
tion Mickey Curry (drums) and

HALL & OATES

T. Bone Wolk (bass), coming
front and center.

My fave rave of the week
though, is a little dessert piece
from John Oates called "Italian
Girls" that's as much fun as
Mulberry Street on a Spring
afternoon.

HZO follows some pretty

.weighty successes in Voices and

Private Eyes, so expecting some-
thing chancv mav l'\2\7o km...

asking too much. Still, there is
so much more this band could be
doing that I'd have to label this
collection of snappy, technically
efficient hits a disappointment.
Hall and Oates is a band now;
a band that's not to be missed
live, but start collecting their
45's if you find what you hear
on the radio that irresistible.

    

A KISS IN THE
DREAMHOUSE
Siouxsie & The Banshees
Polydor Limited (import)

Several months ago, it was
announced that Siouxsie Sioux
had to take a vear or so off from
recording and_touring due to

%
5"

 

throat problems, but, for rea-
sons unknown to me, she's just
released A Kiss In The Dreamhouse,
an album that finds her voice
and her characteristic "Ban-
shee" sound intact.

Siouxsie is sort of like the
female Richard Butler in that
she doesn't sing happy songs (as
a rule), and her music has a lush
feel to it—heavy, almost
hushed, but pounding away
urgently. Saying that she
doesn't write happy songs is
somewhat of an understate-
ment. Evidence nearly every
cut’s lyrics: "Green Fingers"
seems to be about a woman with
a green thumb, but she's really
some sort of witch (”...with this
finger I thee wed/'with this fin-
ger I thee bed..."); "Obsession"
is the voice of a girl so obsessed
with someone that she breaks

into his room just to "touch and
leave a lock of my hair;" the bird
in "Painted Bird" is a "tainted
bird” with ”lead—poisoned
wings;" and "Melt!" has lyrics to
commit suicide by—”So many
blazing orchids/Burning in your
throat/Making you choke/Making
you sigh/Sigh in tiny deaths." If
you're a manic depressive who
needs some cheering up, I
wouldn't advise you to buy A
Kiss In The Dreamhouse. However,
for those of us who enjoy classy
rock that gives us a good kick in
the head, it's nearly perfect.

with hooks and easy—to-grasp

were half as good as this song, it
would strike gold in a few
weeks; as is, it will take a few
months.

Whether kicking ass or mel-
lowing out with ballads, this trio
is at ease—-both are performed
with equal intensity. The big-
gest problem with this album is
taking it off the turntable long
enough to turn it over.

Other good cuts are "Don't It

"You're Gonna Last." Almost
the whole album is very good;
needless to say, it gets an A-1
recommendation. One listen

WILD THINGS RUN FAST
Ioni Mitchell
Geffen Records

Wild Things Run Fast is a logical
next step in the long career of
Joni Mitchell. It combines the
rich rock/pop sounds of her mid

_ '70s LP’s with the jazzy sound of

her later ones. It is the fitting
mixture of the many styles of a
woman who has been in the
music business for almost two
decades. '
Side 1 opens with ”Chinese
Cafe (Unchained Melody)," a
beautiful song presenting a
shocking realization of time
gone by. Mitchell blows it with
the next two tracks——the title
song and ”Ladies Man"—one a
laughable attempt at rocking
out, the other a trite, ”Oh baby,
do what you want with me as
long as you fuck me!” mellow
jazz tune. She redeems herself
with ”Moon at the Window," an
introspective ballad, and ”Solid
Love”—get this!—-a happy song.
”l-Iot dog, darling!" Mitchell

 

cries with joy at discovering a
romance with some hope in it.

Side 2 is much better and
more consistent. On "Be Cool”
and ”(You’re So Square) Baby I
Don't Care," Mitchell lets her-
self do some uninhibited jazz
crooning and just has fun. The
best uptempo song on the
album, ”You Dream Flat Tires,"
combines some solid Mitchell
guitar playing with her old and
faithful standby-—the over-
dubbed choir of her voice. Fin-
ishing up Wild Things Run Fastare
”Underneath the Streetlight,"
the happiest, most positive song
Mitchell every wrote, and
”Love," her declaration of faith
in the emotion that has been the
subject of so many of her songs.

Wild Things Run Fastis no great
album, but it is a good one and a
convincing sellout when one
remembers that just three years
ago, Joni Mitchell was criticizing
rock and pop for being too sim-
ple, thus her attraction to jazz.
What would have made this
album a classic would have been
the removal of a few tracks on
side 1 and the addition of a few
songs where Joni Mitchell just
sits at the piano or plays her gui-
tar and sings.

JIM HOHMAN

ZOMBIE BIRDHOUSE

Iggy Pop
Animal Records

Okay, Iggy lovers, child
molesters and jock-strap aficio-
nados: this one's for you. After a
string of, well, questionable
releases, Iggy Pop seems to have
found his ”niche" in the world of
the rock and roll bizarre. Zombie
Birdhouse, the new album, is, no
doubt, one of Iggy’s best
miscarriages. ‘

Though the rest of the listen-
ing world may still not be ready
for the music of Iggy Pop, those
that have found this musical
contortionist strangely endear-
ing (there must be somebody)
will most likely be pleased with
the release. Zombie Birdhouse is
Iggy’s thesis on America with its
yarns of toil, anger and general
despair (listen to ”Angry Hills,”
”Eat Or Be Eaten,” and ”Life of
Work") a la ”Pop” music. Sur-
prisingly, this album has a lot
more profundity than would be
expected from a man who has
often chosen the gross-out over

artistic integrity. Even the
music, which is provided by
Blondie’s Chris Stein and Clem
Burke and Iggy’s resident musi-
cian, Rob duPrey, is punctuated
with some exotic tribal rhythms
and guitar work, among other
courageous stylings (though
who's to say Iggy has never
been courageous?)

In the past, I've always been a
bit cautious when it came to
revealing my admiration for
Iggy Pop, but with the release of
Zombie Birdhouse, I now feel that I
have a legitimate excuse—an
excuse that hasn't existed for

-quite some time.

I-"RANK DIGIACOMO

UNTITLED
Marc and The Mambas
Some Bizarre (import)

Soft Cell's Non-Stop Erotic
Cabaret was one of last year's
best albums, and the main rea-
son for that was lead singer-
songwriter Marc Almond—he
of the voice that could drip sar-
casm ("Entertain Me"), smirk
innuendo ("Seedy Films") or
drool mushy love songs (”Say
Hello, Wave Good-bye") at the
drop of a hat. Untitled is his
”solo” debut—though, I sup-
pose, The Mambas refers to the

other three people who lend V

their help to the LP: Anne
Hogan (keyboards), Cindy
Ecstacy (back—up vocals) and
Matt Johnson (guitar and song-
writing)—and while Almond’s
voice is still the single most
dominant force, it differs signif-
icantly from Non—5top.

Untitled is sparser than the
Soft Cell LP; indeed, often
Almond’s voice is accompanied
only by a piano, and there's even
one track, ”Margaret,” that's a
solo by keyboardist Hogan.
Most of the songs are pleasant
enough, but only one track
really reaches out and grabs
you, and it's one we've heard
before—Lou Reed's semi-classic
”Caroline Says.” Other decent
but notstupendous songs
include ”Untitled," a ballad-like
pop song that sounds like a '60s
movie soundtrack, ”Terrapin,” a
smokey cabaretish tune much
like material from Non—5top, and
"Twilights and Lowlifes” could
be a sequel to ”Seedy Films."
Jacques Brel’s ”If You Go Away”
is perhaps the oddest choice for
someone of Almond’s reputa-
tion to try, but in his own des-
perate way, he manages to do it
justice.

Untitled is a double album, but
it only contains 10 songs, one of
which is done twice, and the
second ”album” is really just a
12-inch 45. In light of this, and
considering the so-so quality of
the album (albums.7), I have to
wonder why he didn't just
release an_EP_.

ROD STEWART
ABSOLUTELY LIVE
Rod Stewart

Warner Bros.

The only thing I fear more
than the Andy Williams/Fires-
tone Christmas I-Iour is theava-
lanche of collection-packages
the record companies shame-
lessly drop on us every Yuletide.

This live LP from everybody’s
favorite rooster, Rod Stewart, is
a nice souvenir from his three-
ringed tour of last year. For
something more than you'd pay
for the average concert T-shirt,
you can get plenty of crowd
noise, plenty of material and
plenty of Mod Rod's sultry wit
charm. Whether you missed the
show or just can't get enough of
this mop top's stuff, then start
saving the boxtops.

Some of the numbers are lot
of fun (”Young Turks,”
”Tonight I'm Yours,” "Pas-
sion”), but if you’ve'ever seen
the word "Faces" capitalized,
you'd probably rather not sit
through the extended rap of
”Do You Think I'm Sexy.” _,

The tour’s appeal depended a
lot on visual dynamics, Rod's
and otherwise, and yet, there
isn't even a picture ortwo here
to remember them by. Instead,
you get various artist's concep-
tions of burns in leopard leo-
tards (Rod's? His wife's? Idon't
know).

MEN WITHOUT WOMEN
Little Steven and the Disciples
of Soul

EMI

Men Without Women takes its

 

title from a collection of short
stories by Ernest Hemingway
about men who faced the
dangers of life and loneliness
with style. This is Miami (Little
Steven) Steve Van Zandt’s mus-
ical adaptation of the form; a
Gothic-like arrangement of lav-
ish, R&B horn and guitar lines
crossed with Van Zandt’s rude
and unelegant vocals. In
between are stories, from a
male's point of view, about what
men do—without women.

On side one, they ponder and
fight for their territory; their
little piece of the action. ”Lyin In
A Bed Of Fire” immediately

reveals the presence of the
]uke's horn section———La Bam-
ba's Mambomen as they are
called here. The brass blasts
through the chorus, and Van
Zandt’s much underrated guitar
accentuates every open space.

With the exception of a couple
of nice ballads, Van Zandt
returns to this formula again
and again, layering the horns
over familiar Motown rhythms.
"Under The Gun" pants with a
frantic urgency, Van Zandt
swallowing syllables and whole
sentence fragments in his nasal
breaths.

encounter backlash to Van
Zandt’s incessant snarl, it will
begin to grow on you, especially

during the softer number—the"“ ”

title track and side two's ”Prin—

Like those of the Jukes, this is
a love-it-or-leave-it record, but
Miami Steve's talents, both
musically and lyrically have to
be acknowledged. No, this
album doesn't mean he has said
goodbye to the E Street Band. If
anything, it will probably relax
Van Zandt into a more comfor-
table role alongside you know

The Pitt News, Friday December 3, 1982

By MARK A. SINDLER

After talking to Mike Wilton,
coach of Cal Poly-San Luis Obis-
_po’s volleyball team, one might

* surmise that he is preparing for a
war that neither side has much
chance of winning. But don’t get
him wrong. He talks like he's
drooling at the mouth for this war
to begin.

A bit of irony, perhaps. Maybe.
His 12-player roster is matching up
against the Lady Panthers tomor-
row evening.

It will be no ordinary war of two
powers. The battlefield is nestled
away in Northern California. Over
2000 spectators will be afforded
eyewitness accounts of every move
that each side makes.

The officials, usually considered

somewhat partial to the home-
court team, will have to arbitrate
their calls between a 42-6 Lady
Panther team, seeded 26th in a 28-
team field, and a Cal Poly squad
that is currently ranked seventh
nationally and is seeded the same
for this tournament.

“I keep hearing from people,”
Wilton says, “that (Pitt) is a feisty
gang. That's my kind of team....I
respect fighters. This could be the
epitome of coaching, this up—and-
coming match against Pitt.

“Let the coaches shake hands,
have the refs blow the whistle, and
let the battle begin. I hope this is a
slug-it-out kind of match. This
would be fantastic—a five-game
war....that's what it's all about.”

Hmmm, Wilton may have a
point there, even if it’s only par-

shouldn't be too overly concerned.
That is, if one takes to heart what
Wilton evaluates as a top-notch
defensive machine.

“I hear they are a ‘fire-ey’ team,”
Wilton said of Pitt. “They show
good blocking, good defense.”

That, however, is all that Wilton
cares to know or acknowledge of
what Pitt will throw at his Cal Poly
team tomorrow evening. He has
enough to handle with his own
team.

he said. “I want to know what
we're going to do and I say that
because I'm really not too pleased
with our November showing. We
were 19-4 going into November,
but only played 8-5 volleyball all

Wilton recalls his squad facing
no less than 24 Top 20 teams dur-
ing the regular season. Maybe this
is why he has the luxury of slightly
overlooking a Pitt team-—he has
been nationally ranked as high as

been situated No. 5 or 6.

One advantage for Pitt is motiva-
tion, or a lack of it for Cal Poly.

Big Business

By BARRY ZASLOFF

Sports Column

(Second of a three-part series
on intercollegiate athletics as
big business.)

Some distasteful ironies have
developed in Pitt athletics, forc-
ing the men’s volleyball and
women’s field hockey program
beneath ground level.

The caskets, it appears, were
chosen last year. Exact times
and dates of last rites and burial
are uncertain, although there is
a nagging feeling that they took
place shortly after Dr. Edward
Bozik became Pitt's athletic
director.

The ironies. Lord, the iro-
nies. Too many—so many that
a dark cloud hangs over the
entire scene.

Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar
stood before a gathering of
media types last June, speaking
of Bozik's new responsibilities.
"I’m charging Ed with bring-
ing non-varsity sports up to the
level of varsity, with improving
alumni support and with keep-
ing an eye on the best interests
of the student-athletes who will
be placed in careers," he said.

Next at the podium was Dr.
Jack Freeman, senior vice-
chancellor of administration.
“If our athletic department had
needed a shaking up, we might
have gone outside,” Freeman
said of the decision to move
Bozik from the chancellor’s
office to the athletic depart-
ment. “But we have an out-
standing program and we think
Ed Bozik is the man who can
keep it strong.”

And finally, there was Bozik.
“We have to work at the public
relation image of our athletic
department,” he said.

Now, some five months later,
the irony of the programs being
cancelled. It indicates a disre-
gard for non-varsity sports, an
athletic department that has
weakened and has taken a step
backwards in public relations.

“I had a good feeling about
the direction that our program
was going in," says Cindy Bal-
dridge, coach of the Lady
Panther field hockey team.
“Especially since Dr. Bozik said
that he wanted to raise the level
of non-revenue sports."

Baldridge says she was con-
victed without trial. No ques-
tions asked.

“I was called into (director of
women’s athletics) Sandy Bul-
lman’s office last Tuesday and
was told that our program
would be cancelled because of a
$25,000 budget cut," Baldridge
says. “I would have liked to
have been told beforehand so
that I could have stated my
case."

Bozik says he-was faced with a
“reduction in funds” to the
athletic department and that it
was something that he had to
“live up to.” He said it came
down to a “judgment call’’ on
which sports to eliminate.

“It was not an easy decision
to make,” he explains. “It was
made with considered and mea-
sured judgment."

Bozik says that he encoun-
tered two choices: A slight
reduction of the budgets allo-
cated to each sport. or the can-
cellation of two programs and
the maintenance of others at the
same budgets.

That he chose the second pos-
sibility says something about
the purpose of intercollegiate
athletics. Bozik recently said
that collegiate athletics should
“encourage ideas of competi-
tion, enhance physical fitness

Decision To Cancel Volleyball And Field Hockey Full Of Irony

'5

and enhance the public rela-
tions of the university."

By killing the programs,
rather than lowering the budget
allotted to each team, Bozik has
contradicted his own defini-
tion. If, as he says, collegiate
athletics are designed to encour-
age ideas of competition, why
cancel programs? Why take his
very ideal away from the partic-
ipants when there was another
path that would've kept all Pitt
athletic programs intact?

Perhaps it's more evidence
that college sports are big busi-
nesses. Here, a perfect case of
administrators’ eliminating
“waste" in favor of profit.
Sadly, men's volleyball and
women's field hockey would be
missed the least.

“I'm not in business to make
profits," Bozik insists. “Our
objective is to allow the oppor-
tunity for 500 students to partic-
ipate in collegiate sports."

If that is the case, why didn't
Bozik cut from football and bas-
ketball programs, where
$25,000 would hardly be
noticed missing? Why didn't he
stand by his objective of allow-
ing 500 students to participate
in intercollegiate sports?

It's difficult to side" with an
administration that cancels two
of its sports programs for
$25,000 when the Pitt football
team will earn roughly $2 mil-
lion for its part in this year's
Cotton Bowl. If Pitt had to set-
tle for the Fiesta Bowl, which
pays $800,000 to its. partici-
pants, it might have been forced
to cancel the entire sports
department. ‘

Ray Reilly, coach of the
men’s volleyball team, says that
his budget—-his salary
included—is less than $20,000. '
Baldridge says hers was about
$5,000.

Granted, expenses in a sports
program are high. Bozik says
that it costs $750,000-$900,000
to replace the Astroturf at Pitt
Stadium. He adds that it's the
most heavily used stadium in
the country.

Still, $25,000 to a department
that has, according to Bozik, a
revenue flow of $5 million,
seems pale by comparison.

“I don't like it," says Reilly.
‘‘I don't feel that cutting sports
is the answer. It shows that col-
legiate athletics are in big
trouble."

The Pitt Panther track team
opens the 1982-83 season tomorrow
participating in theVVest Virginia
Invitational.‘ .

The meet attracts many of the
smaller colleges in the West Virgi-
nia area as well as a few from sur-
rounding states. It's objective is to
provide the coaches with an oppor-
tunity to evaluate their performers
on a competition basis.

“The meet will give us a chance
to see where we are,” coach John
Vasvary said. “Since it is not a
scored meet (no team scores will be
tallied), we aren’t as concerned
with winning as much as we are
with gaining good experience.

“It gives us the opportunity to
find out who the ‘race runners’ are
and who the ‘practice runners’ are.
We have a lot of guys that have run
well in practice and now we will
see how they do in race
competition.”

Vasvary and Lewis have entered

l9 members in 15 different events.

In the field events, Rob Goldberg

will compete in the longjump and

In the track events, Mario

Joyner Climbs Track Hurdles

By CHARLIE O'HARA

Optimism is running high for
the Pitt Panther track team for the
first time in many years.’With two
new coaches and a commitment to
the program, the team could regain
the success it had in the early 1970s.
One reason for this outlook is the
performance of senior sprinter-
hurdler Mario Joyner.

Joyner is a 5-11, 160 lb. informa-
tion science major from Brashear
High School in Pittsburgh. He is a
sprinter and hurdler and probably

Rich Baderinwa and Rob Gold-
berg. Asbury, Baderinwa and Pol-
lock will also run the 300 meters.
Entered in the 400 and 500-meters
run are Chobany and Joyner.

are scheduled to run the 800-meter
run, and Darrin Geary and Mickey

Mario anywhere from the 60-yard
dash to the 1500-meter run assist-
ant coach Steve Lewis said. “He is
also establishing himself as a
hurdler.”

Joyner has been a sprinter since
eighth grade, but he had never run
any hurdles until head coach John
Vasvary and Lewis began working
with him this fall. This new wrin-
kle has Joyner very excited about
his final year at Pitt.

“I’m looking forward to doing

Rihtarchik will compete in the

really good things as a hurdler,” he
said. “Running sprints for eight
years got to be a little monotonous,
and this new dimension has made
things exciting again.”

Though the team does not offi-
cially designate captains, Joyner
has filled a leadership role.

:“He’s an inspirational leader
and a pleasure to work with,”
Lewis said. “I don't really see any
weaknesses. He’s almost a model
athlete.”

Joyner believes that this season is
quite a bit different from his pre-
vious seasons.

“Our outlookgis totally different
from years past,” he said. “Our
coaches know what it is going to
take to make us successful. They
don’t»accept mediocrity and this
has rubbed off on us.

Pitt will field two relay teams. In
the mile relay, Lewis has not deter-
mined which four of the five
runners under consideration will
be competing. Those five are

bany and Asbury.

nationally and now we have the
coaches who will bring this talent
out."

Joyner said, “The 400-meter-
hurdles is the event that I would
like to excel most in.”

Joyner is obviously very optimis-
tic about this season. He believes
that the West Virginia meet tomor-
row is comparable to the Pitt has-
ketball team playing Westminster.

“This meet should provide us
with an indication of what we will
be able to accomplish this season ,”
Joyner said. “I don’t consider Kent

State or George Mason as competi- 3,

tion. The meet usually doesn’t
draw too many good teams.”

But it’s the start of a new begin-
ning for the Panther track team.

generally building up....we were
really in a groove. Then. wham, it’s
all gone."

“I heard that it was promising
for hockey here for the next two
years, including additional respon-
sibilities for me at,Pitt,” she said.

“Now, it is a shock tome; it's very .

discouraging.

“The program was cut, Bal-
dridge said, “because of the fact
that field hockey is not big at Pitt.
But I would have liked to sit down
and talk about (program cuts). I
wanted to be in on the planning; I
wish they heard me out."

Baldridge said she first realized
the program was in danger when
the NCAA accepted women’s

sports. Her schedule includes Div-
ision III competition since field
hockey is not funded like Division I
schools.

“I don’t have the players to com-
pete,” she said. “With the NCAA in
women’s sports now. there will
now be emphasis on four or five
teams being successful; funds just
can't be spread out any more."

Baldridge also said she thought
Bozik did not give her a fair chance.
Neither Baldridge nor Bozik have
met. She further said that it would
have been more considerate of the
administration if Sandra
Bullman——women’s athletic
director-—-and Bozik sat down with
her and worked out a solution.

“It seems weird that (Bozik) cut

Swimmers Set For Penn State Relays

By SEAN BARNES

The Panther swim team will
travel to State College today and
tomorrow for the annual "Penn
State Relays. The competition con-
sists of relay and diving events
only, with most of Pitt’s regular
dual meet opponents attending.
North Carolina is the meet’s favor-
ite, but Pitt and West Virginia are
expected to give the Tar Heels
s()me competition.

Pitt head coach Fred Lewis is
expecting good times from his 400-
yard medley and freestyle relays,
which only needs less than four-
tenths seconds cut per lap for
NCAA National qualification. “I
know what I should expect from
them,” Lewis said. “It's more than
I expected out of last year’s
National relays at this time, but
both are National caliber and they

"know it. They need to be even faster

if they want to place high at
Nationals."

The Penn State Relays, however,
is a team depth- and sprinter-
oriented meet. Pitt has the sprin-
ters, but not the depth. To make a
butterfly relay, Lewis may find
three butterfliers, but the fourth
will be someone who doesn’t swim
that event in a regular meet.

“It will be a tough meet,” Lewis
said. “We’ll see a lot of our Eastern
competition so it will be fast. Our
three practice meets and one sea-
sonal meet have all the kids
psyched up. I’d say this meet ranks
second fastest to Easterns for the

a» .total season.”

captain Jeff Jelic as he put Barnes
on his back for a 3:36 pin at 167 lbs.

Heavyweight Dan Kasperkowski
finished the match by pinning Yel-
low Jacket Tim Delong in 3:01.

The Panther coaches were
pleased with the team’s first perfor-
mance on the match, but are now
looking ahead to Penn State Invita-
tional this weekend.

The invitation, in its eleventh

,3?‘ yeait, will sport 16 teams this year

including Top-10 ranked Penn
State and Syracuse.

Coryea is hopeful about the out-
come of the tournament.

“This tournament will help set
the tone for individuals," he said.
“There is no team score, so it’s a
chance for the better guy to stand
out.”

Coryea expects several Panthers
to do well, pointing out Jelic,
Haines and Throckmorton as good
contenders for a championship.
Jelic was recently ranked No.4 in
the -nation in the Amateur Wres-
tling News pre—season ratings.

“It was good for Jeff to get the
ranking; he deserved it from his
performance last year." (Ioryea

The diving portion of the meet
will have very strong competition
from Penn State, West Virginia

ers have two veteran divers who are
well known in the East. Pitt will
have two inexperienced divers-
Mark McCormick and John

Pitt diving coach Julian Krug

tion, but he is looking for consis-

 

tency from both divers in the one
and threee meter diving events.
Krug looks at the meetias a learning

won the diving three years straight.

“Our depth will be a helpful fac-
tor at Easterns,” Krug said. “I
think it will take until next season
to have the finely polished diving it
takes to consistently win. Two
years from now, we should mop up

met the man yet and have not even
seen him at a game. With Cas Mys-
linski, if I had any problems, I
could go in and talk to him about
them; he was more personal."

Bozik disagreed, saying Bal-
dridge has yet to attend the all-
coaches meetings he schedules
periodically.

“The meetings I have called,”
Bozik said, “have not been attended
by Cindy. Besides, administrators
in my department called the
coaches involved here, and then I
scheduled individual meetings
with those same coaches."

Reilly said he first found that his
program—which, according to
him, receives approximately
$18,000 annually—was cut when
one of his players informed him of
this.

“I was never notified that the
(program cuts) were in the works,”
he said. “It's like swallowing a big
lump. But you can only improve
non-revenue sports by having the
funds. There aren’t any now, so Dr.
Bozik must cut something and
boost other sports.”

“Volleyball is a very low budget
sport, and I’m just a part-time
coach who has done well nation-
ally. All we’ve done in the last four
years, though has been done for
nothing."

y Programs Cancelled

Associate athletic director Dean
Billick outlined a four step plan to
supplement the monies generated
by the only revenue-producing
team—football.

Basketball, he said, is not break-‘

ing even.

He said increased funding from
the Golden Panthers (booster)
Club will be the primary source of
revenue. The department recently
instituted a prority seating basis
which has almost doubled input
from $450,000 to $867,000 this year.
According to Billick, next year's
projection is $1.1 million.

Billick also said that the depart-
ment wants to reap the benefits of
endowment scholarships. These
are generated when people lea_ve
certain amounts of money to the
university and the school “lives off
the interest, in balance. _T_p_ta__]
amounts, Billick estimated, should
net Pitt approximately $300,000-
$400,000 per year, on a 33-154 mil-

lion investment.

“We’ve done pretty well on the
latter two,” Billick said. “But then

Athletes Shocked By Decision To Cut Programs

had winning seasons every year
and have finished No.3 in the East
each year.”

One player saw promise in Pitt‘s
men’s volleyball team and was con-
vinced of its winning potential so
much that he passed up a scholar-
ship to Penn State, the volleyball
power in the East. ‘

Freshman Mike Keating said he
is so agitated over the latest deci-
sion that he is definitely transfer-
ring next year.

“T am very disappointed,” he
said. “I’m upset because I turned
down that offer to play here, and
now, they cut the program...I
didn’t even know this was going to
happen.

“It makes me wonder...we even
have the second highest QPA.

Well, I'm definitely transferring,
probably to Canada.”

Ultimately, about 33 players
involved will be without sports
programs. They are the ones who
cannot even explain their distress.

One athlete, sophomore lialf-
back Stella Volpe, heard of the
decision and started crying.

“I cried very much," she said.
“We were not consulted, and it all
hit me really hard. But as big as this
university is, I don’t think they can
just do that...they’ll hear from us,
they really will.”

Volpe said she is thinking of
exploiting the pull the Golden
Panthers have; talking to Dr.
Edward Bozik, athletic director;
and preparing petitions.

Phyllis Kusuplus, a sophomore
on the field hockey team, said she is
as equally determined to reverse

Bozik's decision.

“At first, I didn’t believe it,"
Kusuplus said. “Our program is
growing. Our record may not show
it, but we have had a lot of tough
breaks. We've built a solid nucleus
here.

Kusuplus said she has the same
ideas as Volpe but points out that
she and the team are still “in the
planning stages" before any effort
is given to reverse elimination.

“Bozik talked of giving us more
funds before,” she said. “But now,
this is a slap in the face.”

Kusuplus said that the field
hockey program’s abrogation
could be the start of a trend. Soon,
she said, universities will reduce
women’s programs to about four or
five programs, with emphasis to be
given to swimming, volleyball,
basketball and gymnastics.

Billick adamantly disagrees. “l
hope not, I hope this isn’t a trend.’

Bozik later said that even though
schools have until 1984 to come
under full NCAA governance in
women's athletics, Pitt has already
done so. When the full participa-
tion of all affected schools is
achieved, there will be a require-
ment that at least eight programs
be sustained for Division I
eligibility.

After that, he continued, it
would be difficult for schools to
drop many programs and still stay
above the minimum.

Although all players and
coaches interviewed agreed that
any athletic cuts made only gives
that university a bad mark, one ath-
lete cannot understand how other
schools are successful and don’t

“When Ray went in to talk with
Bozik, he brought with him a lotof
statistics showing that Penn State
has a definite possibility of being
No. l in the country," Goldberg
said. And this is a team that has
four of its six starters coming from
Western Pennsylvania.

“That's got to say something; I
expected something to happen to
this program. I expected some
growth at Pitt. Now, not only is

there no growth, but there's ntfi:-"

team. I can’t believe it!"

“How does Penn State have such
a strong program?” he asked. “We
could take some lessons from them.
They've got to be doing something
right—or maybe we’re doing some-
thing wrong."

“Their worst players could be
our best,” Goldberg said. “And
they are all from this area. All they
need is just a little experience. The
point is we have to try for the same
goals as a school as Penn State. All
their teams are so successful.”

Goldberg, a native of Pittsburgh,
has no intentions of transferring.
But the volleyball team’s banish-
ment means that it will be even
harder for him to prepare for the
1984 Maccabee Games he plans to
participate in. Those games are to
be held in Israel. He said he is very
frustrated.

“What’s the justification?” he
asked. “Pitt wants every depart-
ment to cut 3 percent, including
education, yet they still demand
tuition hikes; Ipaid about$950 as a
freshman, now it's something like
$1,105.”

Goldberg said he cannot find a
rationale behind Bozik’s decision.
He realizes that the underlying rea-
son a program he plays for was
eliminated is that since the pro-_

gram offers scholarships, no stu- «1.L”“~

dents will be affected academically.

The real dilemma, he said, lies in
who gets athletic scholarships. He
related a story about a swimmer
who receives a scholarship even
though his father is a millionaire.

“I’m just here to have fun,”
Goldberg said. “Then they go and
cut the program; I’m sure there is
some way (Bozik) can keep the
program.

“When he came here this
summer I thought, ‘This is great-
...(Bozik is) going to fund non-
revenue sports———we might build
the program.’ Huh? Now that he’s
here, just like that, we’re gone!”

, then why
not tell the world
about it!]oin The Pitt " i
