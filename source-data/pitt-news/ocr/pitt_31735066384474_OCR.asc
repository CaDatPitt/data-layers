More Appropriations Problems Ahead for Pitt

By TOM KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer
Student lobbyists traveling to Harrisburg last
Monday were presented a grim picture on the future
of appropriations for Pitt. I

Ten students talked with lawmakers on the status
of Pitt and other state-related universities in the state
budget, particularly on the subject of a recently-
introduced bill that would place Pitt, Penn State,
Temple and Lincoln on preferred status. The state-
related schools are currently on non-preferred status,
which means they could be excluded, or denied top
priority, when the budgetary process has many dif-
ferent factions competing for limited funds.

When asked if the preferred status bill would ever
become . law, Senate majority leader Henry . C.
Messinger said the chances were not good.

“I don’t think that will happen,” said Messinger.

“There would be too much resistence. All non-

or the possibility of losing appropriations altogether.
That is what happens when we have the economic
situation we have today.” ‘

Senator Wilmont E. Fleming, chairman of the
republican caucus, said he believed legislators and
the public :ginning to take a dim view of aid to
colleges and universities.

“The attitude toward higher education is —
becoming like the question and attitude of welfare,”
Fleming said. -

Representative Helen D. Wise is one legislator in
favor of appropriations for state-related schools.

“I cannot see the state allowing appropriations to
be‘ phased out, but I’m not sure,” Wise said. “I’m
going to fight that to the end.”

Wise, former president of the Pennsylvania State
Education Association, stated the faculties of the
state-related schools begin to pay more attention to

In reference to the budget deadline this June 30,
both Senators Messinger and Fleming agreed that a
repeat of the budget battle last summer would be
politically disasterous.

"I am hopeful that we will settle it (the budget) by
the deadline,” Messinger said. “The worst thing we
could do is to have a budget delay.”

Mark McKillop, chairman of the Governmental
and Public Relations committee (GPR) of the student
government and head of Pitt’s student lobby, said a

budget delay this summer probably would not occur. _

“I don’t think it will come down to the deadline
this year because it is an election year,” McKillop
said. “Both sides have been saying they hope the

Pitt’s ROTC issue never
dies; it just fades away—for a
while at least. _

“Just because people are
getting tired of this issue
doesn’t mean it’s going to go
away,” Air Force ROTC cadet
Scott Wagner commented re-
cently.

The issue, a Pitt controversy
for the past decade, centers on
ROTC accreditation in the
College of Arts and Sciences.
Last week, for the third time
since 1968, the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences determined that-
ROTC courses do not warrant
credit.

Following the decision,
however, Wagner and other
cadets charged FAS has failed

“We hopeto increase last year’s

0 say if there will be more interest
as far as registration is concerned.
We’ve tried to get publicity so as to
interest people in the election.”

BAS already has more candi-
dates to choose from in each
position than last year, when every
position including the chairman-
ship, had people running un-
opposed.

To be able to vote, a registration
card must be presented at the polls
along with a Pitt I.D. and current

walidation. A student wishing to
« obtain a card must agree to a

: preamble printed on the back of the

card.

Hillman Library will remain open
from 8 a.m. to 12 midnight “on a
day-to-day basis” until Friday
despite a Pennsylvania Utility
Commission (PUC) order to reduce
electrical power consumption in all
University buildings by 25 percent.

The extended service—which
ends Friday when hours will revert
to 8 p.m. to 10 pl.m.—is a result ofa
claim by Student Government
Board President Josh Baylson and
SGB member Sharon Starzynski
that a cutback in library hours
during mid-terms would adversely
affect students.

The original ‘energy conservation
plan, enacted on Feb. 28, called for
terminating electrical lighting at

10:30 p.m. in all other University

buildings except residence halls,
hospitals and areas where lighting
is vital to safety and security.

According to Baylson, the
University has managed to stay
within the limits of the 25 percent
cut back despite the additional
hours of operation at the library.
He added that Pitt will be forced to
maintain this rate of usage to
prevent intervention by Duquesne
Light Company, who, under the
PUC mandate, has a legal right to
decrease its allotment of power to
the University, should the school
fail to comply with the ‘ordered
cutbacks.

“The University has really put
itself out on a limb for us in
accepting this proposal, but we are

outside . . -

...a heavy ‘snow warning will be in effect

responsive to our suggestions,”
Starzynski said.

She added that several alterna-
tives to cutting back service at
Hillman proposed by the board
were flatly rejected by the

administration. These alternatives‘

included the curtailment of service
only on the third and fourth ﬂoors
of the library and further reduction
lighting in various other areas.
Commenting on the University’s
attempt to comply with the PUC
mandate, assistant to the Vice
Chancellor of budget and finance
John Vrana said, “We just made it
with a 26 percent cutback. Right

to satisfactorily address the
arguments in favor of accredi-

cadets said they were dis-
appointed, they have not lost
their ﬁghting spirit.

‘ ‘There's no way we’re going

Terry Regan, a senior Air'Force
cadet who spearheaded the
accreditation campaign that
ultimately led to the FAS vote.
“It’s a setback, but we’ll press
on.”

faculty support us. The FAS

0 Fusion is

By LEONARD ROMBERG
Pitt News Staff Writer
Sharply criticizing Senator
George McGovern’s energy plan as
a step backward for the nation, Dr.
Morris Levitt Friday promoted
nuclear energy as the best measure
to solve the country's energy woes.

Levitt, editor in chief of Fusion
magazine and executive director of
the Fusion Energy Foundation, told
a Student Union audience that
thermonuclear fusion would
provide the United States with an
almost inexhaustable energy
source.

Fusion is a nuclear process that

combines hydrogen atoms to make
helium atoms, releasing enormous
amounts of energy. According to
Levitt, that process is within reach
of being developed at reasonable
cost.
“Experiments this year will prove
that controlled fusion is scientiﬁcal-
ly and economically feasable,”
Levitt said. “The success of fusion
is dependent on how much money
we put into it.”

Wednesday, March 3, l978—THE PITI‘ NEWSi—Page 3

the Solution to Fuel Problems, Expert Says

Earlier last week, Senator
McGovern said in a speech here that
solar energy was the key to solving
America’s energy crisis and advo-
cated a $1 billion investment in solar
energy. Cautioning against a
nuclear future, McGovern spoke on
what he saw as the dangers of
nuclear energy.

Levitt, who has testified before
the United States Senate Commerce
Committee on President Carter’s
cabinet appointments, and deliver-
ed testimony on fusion power to the
1976 Republican Platform Com-
mittee in his effort to promote
nuclear energy, branded McGov-
ern’s solar energy proposal as
detrimental and insufﬁcient.

Levitt said the United States must
choose between two paths of energy
development which could be the
basis for “continued civilization in
the United States.”

Soft technology, the development
of solar energy and burning waste
product such as wood chips, would
not provide enough energy to keep
the nation at its current standard of
living according to Levitt.

“The argument that soft tech-
nology would provide more jobs
and produce new energy is a
hoax,” Levitt said. “A push toward
nuclear energy would create
millions of jobs.”

Senator McGovern supported
solar energy as a way to tackle the
nation’s unemployment problem.

‘ ‘Increased technology that takes
away jobs is a fraud. New jobs are
created at a faster rate than old ones
are phased out,” "Levitt said,
advocating the building of
thousands of nuclear reactors.

During his lecture, Levitt refer-
red to charts and explained how
energy is produced and measured in
an effort to educate persons on the

’ energy dilemna.

He said solar energy can only
provide one thousandth (1/ 1000) of
a megawatt per square meter while
oil provides 10; nuclear, 100, and
fusion, 1000 to possibly millions of
megawatts per square meter.

‘ ‘If you are for solar energy; then
you are for a return to the times
before the steam engine,” Levitt
charged.

Describing the United States as
“the world’s leading industrial
nation limping along at a fraction of
its potential,” he advocated a
$15-20 billion investment into

constructing a prototype fusion»

reactor in the next decade.

Levitt said technology can be,
developed to make nuclear prolifer- ;
ation to other nations ‘ ‘fool-proof. ’ ",

Urging American nuclear develop-
ment, he said the Soviet Union has
developed a mass production
facility for conventional nuclear
plants to sell on the world market.

their representatives who have
voiced support for accreditation.”
Army cadet Tim O’Neil agreed
with Regan.

“I think a lot of the faculty had
their minds made up before we
presented our arguments. I gave
ourselves a 50-50 chance at best,
since I knew that many of the
faculty have strong anti-military
feelings and we would be combat-
ting that kind of emotionalism
rather than the real issue of

~ accreditation. ’ ’

The “real” issue, cadets say, is
the worth of their military and
aerospace studies courses.
According to Army cadet Thur-
man Gardner, Pitt’s faculty is
“living in the past” and “listening
to the radical element.”
“Whether people like it or not,
the military is going to exist. It’s
part of the world today. But that’s
not the question,” Gardner said.
“ROTC courses have made me a
better person, more conﬁdent and
assertive,” Gardner maintained.
“I can use that more than anything
else I’m learning.”

Frank Craig, a senior Army
cadet, claimed he has “had some

CAS courses that are more
military-oriented than ROTC cour-
ses.”

“The people in ROTC believe in
it. Our instructors are qualified,
we aren’t taught to kill and we are
free to take whatever courses we
want,” Craig said.

Some cadets say the military is a
means to an end. Judi Vincenti, an
Air Force cadet, is a nursing
student and receives credit for
ROTC courses.

“I wonder what people think we
actually do,” she said. “I guess
some people don’t know what we
learn. I want to be a nurse and my
military career is secondary.”

The consensus among ROTC
members seems to be that the
apparent anti-military sentiment of
some faculty members will be the
cadets’ nemesis.

‘ ‘The faculty analyzes everything
—that’s their job,” Army cadet
Mike Walley said. “They’ve
analyzed this issue and decided
they’re against the military be-
cause the military was involved in
things they object to. That may be
a reasonable conclusion, but it has
nothing to do with accreditation. I
think their view is off base, but I

Cadets Express Disappointment
Over ROTC Accreditation Defeat

don’t know how to convince them of
that.”

Walley also said he thought any
future campaigns to persuade FAS
to reconsider would need “more
student involvement.”

But cadets disagree on what they
should do next. “It would be better
to wait,” Vincenti said. “If we
keep bugging them (FAS), it will
only make it worse.”

O’Neil said it will be “another
two or three years” before the
issue resurfaces, while Regan
maintains it is , important to
capitalize on “the momentum
we’ve gained in the last year.”

Regan indicated that “some-
thing drastic” may be in the offing,
but said such actions as a lawsuit or
“going over the faculty’s heads”
have not been seriously consid-
ered.

Wagner, however, said the only
way to regain the credit is to “do it
again” through regular channels.

But, whatever happens in the
battle for accreditation, the cadets
are not about to surrender.

As Wagner put it, “We’re
confident we can sway our
strongest opponents.”

“ 72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh”

Grim Portents

Judging by the responses given by legislators Monday to mem-
bers of the SGB’s Governmental and Public Relations committee,
Pitt’s future state appropriations are in jeapordy.

It is not likely, however, that the University will be cut off com-
pletely, Senate Majority Leader Henry Messinger’s doomsday talk
notwithstanding. Any move to completely cut the non-preferred,
state-related institutions from the budget would entail some com-
plex legislation and would meet with considerable opposition, even
in this commonwealth of parent/student apathy. Any student of
government knows it takes a lot to kill an already-existing ap-
propriation. .

Still, the mere suggestion of such an eventuality is appalling.
Even if the University manages to maintain its present level of fun-
ding, it is steadily losing ground to inflation. The probability of a
tuition. hike in the fall is increasing already; should the University
ever lose state funding, the result would be unthinkable. Few
students could afford to continue here, assuming any wanted to.

It also appears that Senate bill Sl278—which would remove Pitt,
Penn State, Temple and Lincoln from non-preferred status—is
going to fail. These institutions are “non-preferred” in the sense
that their appropriations require a two-thirds vote in both cham-
bers of the legislature for passage. (This two-thirds vote is required
because the four universities are not completely controlled by the
state.) Upgrading their status would mean the legislature could ap-
prove their appropriations with a simple majority—but it could
also mean increased control over the universities’ operations.

At this point it is unclear whether increased ease in acquiring
funding would be worth the probable trade—off of control. For the
most part, the quality of education at presently-operating state-
controlled colleges is relatively poor when compared to what is
available at Pitt, but this may or may not be relevant to what would
happen if the state took control here. Nevertheless, there is good
reason to look before we leap in favor of S1278, whether it will pass
or not.

And as long as we're on the subject, there is even better reason to
start wailing for more money. as beﬁts a neglected, non-preferred.
poor relation.

Letters to the Editor

Colonel Lalids Cadet Efforts

The ROTC students are to be
commended on their restraint and
personal conduct at the Feb. 28 FAS
meeting. Student leaders, Terry
Regan, Timothy O'Neil, Scott
Wagner and others presented
well-supported and unemotional
appeals for restoring CAS academic
credit to ROTC courses on the basis
of their merit.

For two years thé students had
labored under the impression that
FAS credit was withheld because of
concern over the academic content
and quality of instruction. As the
meeting unfolded, it became clear
that this was not the major issue.
Instead, personal attacks on the

military and insults to the students
such as ‘ ‘instruments of obedience,
threat and destruction” were
emotionally voiced. The students’
composure and restraint in the face
of these attacks reflects credit upon
them and the University.

It comes as no surprise that the
students conducted themselves in
an outstanding manner. They are
quality people both personally and
academically. I am forever con-
vinced that, as a result of ROTC,
these young people will become
better leaders and citizens prepared
to make greater contributions to our
society.

Contrary to the outcome of the
voting, the real winners were the
students. Yes, they are disap-
pointed. But as a result of this
disappointment they will be better
prepared to meet future difﬁculties
and trials. They have earned the
right to hold their heads high in the
ﬁrm conviction they supported a fair
and just cause in a manner beﬁtting
of the democratic process. I would
like to simply say to the ROTC
students, “I am proud of you.”

possible to dig it out.

Arising out of the late 1960's, the
taxpayers’ revolt was basically a
middle-class reaction to the blind
and unthinking escalation of the
cost of government. It was people
saying to their elected ofﬁcials on all
levels, from local to national, that

the pattern of increasing taxes

not continue forever. It was a spur to
governments across the country to
take a look at outmoded and
ineffective programs before adding
new ones. It was beneﬁcial in many
ways, though not in all ways.

You will notice that I am referring
to the taxpayers’ revolt in the past
tense. That is because the nature of
the movement has changed, and
changed for the worse, in the last
couple years. Now, in every sense of
the word, the taxpayers are
revolting.

The change from taxpayers
wanting government to use the
money taken from them in the
efﬁcient and widely beneﬁcial
manner, to not wanting government
to take any money from them at all,
is a subtle one. It is a change from a
realization that government is
necessary to provide collectively
those things that we cannot
adequately provide individually, to
a selﬁsh belief that my money_ is
mine and I'm the only one whojis
going to beneﬁt from it. It is an
abdication of those willing to settle
for the deferred gratification of
better education and a better
standard of life in the future for
themselves and their children, to
those interested only in the
instantaneous self-gratiﬁcation of
being able to do as they please with
all their money, with no respon-
sibility to their fellow citizens.

This is a situation which is in no
way conducive to effective demo-
cratic government. Yet it is the
situation in which most of the
country finds itself today.

Just a few months ago in Ohio,
the voters in one city turned down a
proposal to raise their property
taxes. As a result, the schools
closed because they had no money
to continue operations. After a
period of time another vote was
taken on the tax issue and it ﬁnally
passed. The schools reopened and
the extent of the tragedy caused by
the selﬁsh taxpayers was limited.

Closer to home, we have in this
area a group calling itself the
Concerned Taxpayers of Allegheny
County. The name is misleading.
Everyone should be concerned
about how much tax they pay and

where the money goes. But these
people go one step further. They are
not concerned, they are hysterical.
Whenever someone proposes in-
creasing governmental spending,
raising taxes, or, God forbid, giving
a pay hike to elected ofﬁcials,
the Concerned Taxpayers raises
such a ruckus you would think the
world was coming to an end.

The knee-jerk reaction of such

' people indicates that the taxpayers’

revolt is coming full circle. What
began as a movement to get some

THOUGHTS AND
REFLECTIONS

thought into government and public
affairs has now become character-
ized by the same kind of blindness
and. unthinking _ reaction that
characterized its “enemy” before.
Government used to say all taxing
and spending was good. The
taxpayers movement said some was
good and some was bad. Now, the
Concerned Taxpayers and others of
that ilk are saying it is all bad. In
doing so, they are just as wrong,
and probably more dangerous, than
the governmental ofﬁcials who used
to say it was all good.

This type of drivel is now being
carried to its logical extreme. That
extreme is being reached in
California. There is a» state-wide
proposition on the ballot in
California this spring to reduce all
property taxes in the state by
two-thirds. There are no conditions
placed on this restriction. All
property taxes will be cut by
two-thirds.

To say the effects of the passage
of such a proposal would be
catastrophic is a gross under-
statement. In California, as’in most

states, the primary source of
revenue for local government is the
property tax. To remove two-thirds
of that money is to shut down local
government. Public transportation
would become a thing of the past.
Garbage pickups would be merely a
pleasant memory. Free public
education for children would be
nonexistent. Police and ﬁre depart-
ments would be on a proﬁt-making
basis, charging fees for their
services.

None of this seems to worry the-
supporters of the proposal. Their’
only concern is to getmore cash into
their own pockets. Who cares if the
rest of society goes downhill? The
depressing part is that they are
different from Concerned Tax-
payers only in degree, not in type.

Reports from Calfomia say the
tax reduction proposal is gaining
support and may actually pass. That
shows the depths to which the
taxpayers’ movement, once a good
idea, has fallen. I hope all those who
vote for the proposal get what they
deserve.

A democratic government exists
only by the consent of the governed.
In the American system, govern-
ment exists only to help the
governed, to provide for the
common good. The idea is that by
ﬁrst providing for the common
good, we will also provide for
individual good. What we are now
seeing is the rise of a belief that the
common good and individual good
are not related in that manner. If
this trend continues, if the

Opinion

Middle East Arms Sales Are ]]l-Advised

By LEONARD ROMBERG

Proliferation of military hard-
ware is an increasingly serious
problem in a world with many
volatile areas. Now, the climax of
weapons sales has just been
proposed, ironically by President
Carter.

Only one and a half years ago,
Carter made a campaign issue over
the amounts of arms the United
States was selling abroad, partic-
ularly to third world nations. He
called for great reductions in
weapons sales.

The United States has been
supplying arms to nations in the
Middle East, especially Iran and
Israel, and to pro-American gov-
ernments in Africa and Asia, such
as South Korea and Taiwan.

Unfortunately, the President has
picked the Middle East as the place
to peddle the most advanced war
planes in the American arsenal.
The entire deal raised many
questions about American policy
and the quest for a Middle East
peace settlement.

The proposed sale would send 60
F-15 ﬁghter-bombers to Saudi
Arabia, 75 F-16 ﬁghters and 15
F-15’s to Israel and 50 F-5E

ﬁghter-bombers to Egypt. That is
quite a lot of ﬁrepower.

The F-15 is the most advanced
war plane in the world, outper-
forming anything the Soviets have,
and the F -16 falls not too far behind.

The F-5E’s are older and not as
potent, but they are still effective.

Surprisingly, some American
diplomats and political analysts
have labeled the sale a well-
thought-out diplomatic move to
promote peace. If anything,
however, it would do the opposite.

Now is not the time to build the
military forces of Middle East
nations. Peace negotiations are at
a standstill and the nations are not
much closer to peace than they are
to war. Furthermore, military
might tends to harden bargaining
positions, not loosen them.

There is certainly no historical
precedent that says military sales
Wlll promote peace treaties in the

Middle East. War has broken out

four times, each time after the '

nations were rearmed by their
respective client state. If a nation
wants and receives military hard-
ware, the assumption is that it will
be put to use.

Soviets Threaten in the
Horn of Africa

By EGAL N. ALI

The United States response to an
all-out Soviet-Cuban intervention in
the Horn of Africa has so far been
limited to ineffectual verbal denun-
ciations. In light of the Administra-
tion’s bold initiatives to “challenge
the Soviets in strategic places like
Somalia,” and the consequent tilt in
the Somalia’s alignment away from
the Soviets. the long-term conse-
quences of the present “wait and
see” United States policy are
enormous.

First, a Soviet-Cuban victory in
this strategically placed area will
threaten the long term stability of
not only the Horn (including the
Djibouti and possibly Kenya) but
the Middle East as well. It would

G UES T COL UMN

and Libya to help

“increase the nervousness of Amer-

ica’s staunchest allies, such as
Saudi Arabia, Iran and the Gulf
States.

Second, it might discourage other
third world countries——especially in
Africa—from challenging Soviet
hegemony once the latter establish-
es a foothold. As a threshold of
Western tolerance to Cuban
military intervention is lowered, the
Soviets could use other third world
allies like Ethiopia, South Yemen
liquidate

ﬁt
'ﬂZopposition. That way they can

always keep one step ahead of a
seemingly confused United States
response. _

Third, the United States might
begin to be viewed as unreliable,
even when its strategic interests are
at stake. This could foster the
feeling among African and other
non-aligned states that it is better to
enjoy limited sovereignty in return
for Soviet protection than to incur its
wrath and possible domination.
This certainly is the case with

 Somalia.

Q

It had been a staunch ally of the
Soviets for a decade and had
minimal contacts with the West.
When it ﬁnally broke rank, partly as
a result of United States urgings.

it was left in the cold. It faces alone
the unmasked wrath of the
Soviet Union, which is determined
to punish it for fouling up the game
plan.

A Soviet diplomat is reported to
have remarked, “We will teach the
Somalis a lesson they will never
forget. We will bring them to their
knees?’

For a whole generation of Somalis
who became familiar with the West
only through this apparent betrayal,
their negative views of the West
could only be strengthened.

Fourth, the Soviets will have
psychologically, and eventually
physically, enlarged the area within
which they can with immunity
determine internal developments.
The crackdown on “,revisionism”
would no longer be limited to
eastern Europe.

Fifth, pressure on the United
States and its allies to act will
increase, thus raising the probabil-
ity of an over-reaction to a limited
internal situation.‘The cycle that
started with Vietnam might then be
fully traversed, but now with an
opponent who has carefully culti-
vated his surrogates and has a wide
array of them to deploy in different
situations.

The Soviet challenge in the Horn
of Africa is without precedent.
United States inaction would cause
irreparable damage to its interests
and threaten the very survival of
the people in that area. Determined
and quick action by the United
States is needed to neutralize the
Soviet actions. There must be a
sincere effort to solve once and for
all the crux of the problem in a way
that takes into consideration the
wishes of the inhabitants of the
Ogaden region. With or without
United States intervention and with
or without the Soviet designs, the
liberation efforts will continue. The
question seems not to be will the
Ogaden people achieve indepen-
dence, but rather when, how much
and at what cost?

The author is a student in the Graduate
School of Public and International A f-
fairs at Pitt. A

Common sense would seem to
dictate that one doesn’t promote
peace by arming two adversaries to
the hilt.

Despite the proposed sales,
President Carter had the right idea
in mind from America’s viewpoint.
If the United States wants to appear
as an honest broker, it will have to
treat both sides equally.

But instead of using weapons, the
United States should bargain with
economic aid. By offering aid for
peaceful purposes to strengthen the
economies of Egypt and Israel, the
incentives for peace are enhanced;
the price to pay for war becomes
that much higher.

A limping economy was one
major factor behind Sadat’s peace
initiative. As for Israel, their
situation is not much better.
Defense takes about 45% of the
GNP in an economy strapped with a
35% inﬂation rate.

Clearly, the United States should
exploit those nations’ need for
peace and drop weapons sales to all
sides during this critical period of
negotiations.

If bargaining with butter instead
of guns appears a naive solution,
picture the following scenario:

Peace talks break down totally
and a ﬁfth Middle East war erupts.
Both sides are killing each other

using the advanced weapons
supplied by the United States.

America, that peace-loving dem-
ocracy, is faced with the embar-
rassment of having provided the
tools for yet another war.

Obviously, President Carter does
not see that as a likely occurence.
But in the Middle East, anything
can happen.

There is no reason for the United
States to be in the least sway
responsible for future bloodshed
anywhere in the world. It is time to
stop the spread of arms, and the
Middle East should be the first
place where America lives up to that
policy.

Ad Campaign By BCOA

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON—The Bitumin-
ous Coal Operators’ Association ran
full-page advertisements in 11
newspapers Tuesday accusing the
United Mine Workers union of
holding the nation hostage with its
strike. I

The ads were headed, “An open
letter to the American people, the
Congress, the President.” The
BCOA said the ads were placed in
the Washington Post, New York
Times, Wall Street Journal and
eight papers in coal mining areas.

‘ ‘The Bituminous Coal Operators
have leaned over backwards to end
the strike,” the ads said. “All of us
must now support lawful efforts to
work without rewarding irrespon-
sible conduct.”

The UMWA has been on strike
against the bituminous operators a
record 92 days. By an overwhelming
vote last weekend, the miners
rejected contract terms agreed to by
the union’s Bargaining Council.
Earlier, the Bargaining Council had
turned down a settlement agreed to
by union negotiators.

In their newspaper ads the
operators said the real issue in the
deadlock is the union’s rejection of
“language intended to cure a
problem which has plagued the
industry and harmed the nation’s
energy goals-the problem of
wildcat strikes.”

“The UMWA holds the nation
hostage with threats of devastating
losses of power,” the operators
said. “UMWA members have
openly told the American people
that ‘We may freeze, but you will
freeze with us.’

“Such threats, though they
display remarkable insensitivity,
might be tolerable if they were

backed only by a legal strike,” the
ad said.“But this is not the case.
For although the UMWA repre-
sents only about half the nation's
coal miners, it has, through violence
and intimidation, virtually stoppéd
all movement of coal.”

The operators also said earlier
walkouts by miners were respon-
sible for low stockpiles which have
caused some areas to run low on fuel
during the current strike.

“Those low stockpiles are the
direct result_of a widespread wildcat
strike engaged in by UMWA
members for 10 weeks in 1977,
during the term of the last labor
agreement,” they said.

“During the three-year term of
the last coal agreement, the BCOA
companies suffered over 8,900
illegal wildcat strikes which resul-
ted in a loss of over 45 million man
hours, and lost production of over 62
million tons of coal,” the ads said.

Studio Theater—Catl1edra|’s Black Box
livens Basement With Performance

By CHERYL PASTORIUS

The Studio Theater lies amid
the catacombs in the dusty
basement of the Cathedral of
Learning. White letters spelling
“Studio Theater” adorn the
entrance to the place that was a gym
before Trees Hall was built.

The theater looks like a square
black box, and indeed is called a
black box theater. With this type of
theater, it is possible to create many
stages and settings: theater-in-the-
round, proscenium stage (set above
the audience) or cineramic stage
(set straight across).

“It’s a very comfortable place,
and very conducive to rehearsal,”
said Sheila Bodin, actress and
vice-president of Studio Theater.

“This is a good place to work in
because of the seclusion,” added
Caryn Ronis, actress and Studio
Theater business manager.

The theater’s seating arrange-
ment is informal; about 50 armless,
plastic chairs are set on rows of
platforms, so they can be rear-
ranged to ﬁt each set. This made it

‘ possible for the actors in the Studio

Theater production of Woody
Allen’s “God” to interact freely

‘ ‘Women can never be too careful
about protecting themselves from
attack,” said Bobbi Snyder, direc-
tor and founder of the Feminist
Karate Union of Pittsburgh.
Snyder, the highest-ranked woman
in the United States Karate
Association (USKA), has been
teaching self-defense and karate
classes to men and women for the
past 14 years. In the past ﬁve, she
has spent most of her time teaching
women in the FKU.

“I became involved with femin-
ism in in the early 1970’s, and I
began to realize that it was the
women who were the victims in our
society,” Snyder explained. She
eventually devoted all of her
teaching time to self-defense
classes for women. The classes
became a service arm of South Hills
National Organization forWomen in
1973; in 1974, enrollment had
jumped from 12 to 100. NOW was
unable to handle the volume of
registration; Snyder broke away
and formed FKU in 1974.

Afrikaans, Dutch, Greek, Ice-
landic, Indonesian and Quechua are
just some of the foreign languages
students can now learn through
Pitt's Uncommonly Taught Lan-
guages program.

The ﬂexibility of the program,
which takes into consideration the
language goals of the individual‘
student, currently has attracted
over 90 students, according to
Robert T. Henderson, director of
the Language Acquisition Institute.

with the audience. “It’s
intimate,” Ronis said.

Critical moments in the Studio
Theater come around performance
time. “If the lights blew out, we
would use the house lights in an

emergency,” Bodin said.

very

An actor in “God” once became
stuck in the ceiling opening he was
supposed to drop from. “We didn’t
think we would get him down,”
Bodin said.

The last-minute set production
rush also poses proble-ms for the
actor-student. “If you are construc-
ting a set in the last few days, you
have to set your priorities—either
classes or Studio Theater,” said
Bodin.

“Theater students don’t sleep
much, and they keep Burger Chef
a1ive,” Bodin added.

Besides staging plays, Studio
Theater activities include designing
classes, children’s theater, ﬁnal
scenes for acting classes, regular
performance classes and Studio
Board meetings.

The theater’s primary goals,
according to Studio Theater pro-
duction manager and actor David
Bansavage, are “to teach students
in a classroom situation and to open

FKU offers three sections of a
beginning self-defense course. The
course, which is held at Falk School
in Oakland, costs $35 for 10 weeks.
Snyder described the course as
“basic street defense,” but said
many women continue, after their
ﬁrst course, into formal karate
training.

“A lot of women come into the
self-defense classes scared,” said
Snyder. “They’ve either been
raped, or know someone who has, or
been traumatized by all the stories
they've heard. After 10 weeks, you
see attitudes change. The more you
grow, the more you want to grow. ”

The basic self-defense course
stresses both physical and psycho-
logical preparation. Students are
not only taught what to do to defend
themselves in possible attack
situations, but also how to spot
and avoid them. Snyder emphasiz-
ed that one of the most important
elements in self-defense training is
talking with the instructor and
fellow students.

Henderson is responsible for
setting up each language class.

The program is the only one in
Pittsburgh that offers students the
opportunity to learn several of the
languages offered.

This semester, 14 different
languages are being taught in
classes that have a maximum of four
pupils and a minimum of one. Up to
14 credits can be earned.

Students study 10 hours per week
.in the language lab using tapes and
books, and meet two hours per week
with a native-speaking teacher.

other students to the theater. Dick

Knowles (theater technical director L’,

and faculty advisor) and I work
together on production for opening
night.

“Reading about sets is boring,”
Bansavage added. “You have to be
there to get interested in it.”

Studio Theater is funded by Pitt's
Student Government, which gives it
$683 for each production, but the
space belongs to the theater
department, and is governed by the
Studio Board.

The theater produces three plays
yearly, ranging from musicals and
classics to comtemporary comedy
and drama.»

As for Studio Theater becoming
independent, Bansavage, Bodin
and Ronis said they are against the
idea. “If we put up a show and it
ﬂopped, we would lose out,” said
Bodin. At least we don’t lose out
with SGB funding.”

Even though Studio Theater
members are enthusiastic about
bringing legitimate theater to the
masses, the theater likely will
remain in the Cathedral catacombs.
It would lose its character if it were
any other way.

“I encourage students to talk
about their experiences,” she said.
“A lot of my students have been in
attempted rape situations. As a
matter of fact, one woman was
grabbed by two men right in front of
the school. She was a beginning
student, and she couldn’t do much
more than scream and yell,"but the
school guard came out and chased
them away. Later, the two men
attacked a woman in the parking lot
of Monteﬁore Hospital. When a
woman shares her experience, it
acts as a super-reinforcement, both
to her and to the members of her
class.”

Often, Snyder said, women
encounter more problems not on the
street, but at home. Many men are
threatened when women they know
learn how to defend themselves.

“It’s an extremely paternalistic
attitude. I warn beginning studnets
not to go home and practice with
their husbands or boyfriends
because often the guy is threaten-
ed, and the reactions can be very
dangerous to a woman. women

The student in an uncommonly
taught language class sets his own
goals, which could be to learn a
language fully, to read it or to get by
as a tourist. He is graded on his
progress by his teacher and a
supervisor, and also takes a mid
term and a ﬁnal.

“Students in the program are
those who want to learn the
language of their ethnic heritage, or
those who need to learn a language
for research or a career,” said
Henderson. ’

The most popular language in the
program is Arabic, with 36 students

need to understand that it’s that
man’s particular problem, not
theirs. If you happen to be involved
with a man, then ofcqurse you have
to deal with it. But if you can’t break
through to him, it’s not your
problem.”

After the first 10 weeks of
training, many students join FKU
and begin formal training. The
group currently has about 55
members, who practice together in
different groups, depending on the
level of skill. Some members of
FKU are also in training as teaching
assistants. These teaching assis-
tants help the instructor of the
self-defense classes, as well as
giving demonstrations to various
community groups.

Snyder also is director of
women’s activities within USKA.
Snyder began karate 16 years ago as
the only woman in a class of 35 men.
She described her first years as a
teacher and member of USKA as a
struggle.

enrolled. Greek is second, with 20
students enrolled.

Hebrew was moved to the
department of Jewish studies as a
regular course because over 100
students enrolled.

“If there is a consistent student
demand for a certain language, and
there is a department able to
organize it as a regular course,
instruction in that language would
move to that department,” said
Henderson. “This seems to be
happening to Arabic. There is some
hushed talk of opening a Mid-East
studies program at Pitt. ”

Women ’Unconvinced’ in Feminist Karate Union

“When I ﬁrst started, I was
denied entrancetto karate tourna-
ments and meetings. The
discrimination was very blatant.
And, at that time, I didn’t always
have the conﬁdence in myself to
speak out.

“Finally, though, I staged a sit in.

At on meeting of black belts, just
before a tournament, the other
members—all men—-changed the
location of the meeting from a hotel
room to the men’s room. When I
found out, I just walked in
there—there were men ﬂoating
around, and some them climbed
into the stalls when they saw me.
Oh, there were incidents, but they
let me stay.”

There are now female black belts
in every state, and Snyder said that
the women in the USKA support
each other. _

“It’s better. I don’t have to
organize. I do give advice. Now
there are other women in karate
with mouths as big as mine, and I
like it a whole lot better now.”

Arabic to Quechua: Uncommon languages at Pitt

When a language is requested,
Henderson ﬁnds a native speaker,
sets up a schedule convenient to the
student and the" teacher, and
assigns a course supervisor.

“If a native speaker can’t be
found, we can’t have the course.
This is rare, but it happens,” said
Henderson.

This term, a Spanish girl applied
five months in advance for
Quechua, but a teacher wasn’t
found until after the add-drop
deadline, when it was too late to
register.

McKillop believed the trip was
worthwhile and informative.

“We got some good information
in terms of how we stand on
S1278--the bill to put Pitt on
preferred status,” he said. “It
takes two sessions of the General

amendment and all sources indicate
it’s going to be almost impossible
for it to pass.”

The bill was introduced by
republican Senator Doyle Corman.
No bill introduced by a republican in

Making the Harrisburg trip with
McKillop were Phil Cillo, chairman

president of the College Young

to get this year. Non-preferred
status is better for us because on a
preferred status the state will have
more control over what we can do.”

Cillo said he found the lobbying a
frustrating and confusing experi-

ence.

“I was really surprised that so
many senators and representatives
did not keep appointments. Their

office hours were not scheduled or
attended,” Cillo said.

McKillop indicated the overall
situation for Pitt and state
appropriations is not good.

“The trends are not really
favorable for us at this point in
time,” McKillop said. “I feel we
are in a downward trend. Senator
Messinger indicated to us that

Bud Vibes
Checked by
New ‘Reader’

By The Associated Press
WASHINGTON——Remember those
old westerns where the scout stuck
his knife into the ground and
listened for vibrations to learn if
Indians or buffalo were nearby?

The government does. And it’s
testing an updated version of the ,,A 1
system to see if it can determine”
when earthen‘ dams are safe.

In modern scientiﬁc terms the
device is known as a “rumble
reader,” and it’s a bit more
complex than the famous Bowie
knife.

But the principle is the same:
movement in the earth causes
vibrations and listening to those
vibrations can give you an idea of
what’s going on.

The Environmental Protection
Administration, which developed
the device, has already had some
success with it. And now the Army
Corps of Engineers, spurred by the
collapse of an earthen dam
Toccoa Falls, Ga., last year that
killed 39 persons, is testing the
device as part of its program to
check the safety of all earthen
dams.

Last year EPA ‘inspectors using a
rumble reader discovered that two
storage lagoon dikes at Oswego,
N.Y., were in danger.

The dikes held back poisoned
water collected by a waste disposal
firm. If they had failed, the toxir;
ﬂuid would have spilled into Lair:
Ontario. Instead, the lagoon was‘
safety drained and the contents
puriﬁed.

The device uses two 10-foot steel
rods driven into the ground at the
dam. A portable electronic measur-
ing device is hooked to these rods
and reads the vibrations.

All solids emit sounds when
placed under pressure, but most of
these sounds cannot be heard by
the human ear. The sounds get
louder as watel‘ ﬁltering into an
earthen dam causes
particles to shift slightly. The
device compares the sounds with
what the dam sounded like in past
readings and determines if there is
a hazard, EPA scientists said.

High Anxiety
Directed by Mel Brooks
20th Century Fox

Mel Brooks and Woody Allen,
although somewhat different in

Arts

taste and method, remain the
“masters of mirth” of present-day
ﬁlmmakers. Where Allen may
choose to be suggestive, Brooks’s
humor often jumps off the screen
with no more subtlety than a horse
getting punched in the mouth.
The quality of Brooks’s latest
ﬁlm, “High Anxiety,” was insured
to the audience in the opening
minutes when his name appeared
six times in the opening credits.
“High Anxiety,” which Brooks
wrote, directed and starred in, is
dedicated to Alfred Hitchcock
(referred to by Brooks as the
master of suspense) and draws bits
from “Psycho,” “The Birds,”

“North By Northwest” and others.
It is not necessary to have an
understanding of Hitchcock ﬁlms to

in the original Hitchcock film, “The blrds,” our feathered friends

enjoy “High Anxiety,” much as
someone who knew little about
westerns could still appreciate
“Blazing Saddles." The audience
seemed to be able to spot the
Hitchcock references rather easily,
but a knowledge of Hitchcock films
can only add to the enjoyment of
the ﬁlm.

Like Allen, Brooks prefers to use
the same actors in his ﬁlms, with
Madeline Kahn, Harvey Korman
and Charlie Callas becoming
veterans of his style of humor.

Brooks borrows another “Allen-
ism” and gives it his special touch
in a skit early in the ﬁlm. Riding in
a limousine, Brooks’s chauffeur
utters-the words “foul play” and
an orchestra immediately begins to
play chilling music. A quick look
around reveals the orchestra to be
driving past Brooks, playing in a
bus. Allen used a similar
technique in “Bananas.”

Brooks portrays Richard Thorn-
dyke, a psychiatrist who has taken
control of the Psycho-Neurotic
Institute for the Very Very
Nervous. His predecessor has met
an untimely end, and the institute
and Korman are under the control
of Nurse Diesel, a buxom,
mustachioed Nazi played by Cloris
Leachman. ‘

viciously attacked humans. in “High Anxiety,” Mel Brooks is the victim of a

different, but equally vicious assault.

 

Move over, Janet Leigh. Mel Brooks isn’t wet behind the
ears when he parodies the shower scene in Alired Hitch-

Although the plot is not as
intricate as one Hitchcock would
use, Brooks manages to lampoon
“Psycho’s” shower scene and the
bell tower climax from “Vertigo,”
and he creates a crudely humorous
take-off of “The Birds.”

Kahn plays the blonde heroine
who is cool in the face of danger,
but who, like every other support-
ing character, has strange sexual
preferences.

Nightclub singers are not spared

Brooks’s cutting edge, as he sings

a number meant to parody
romantic title songs while mimick-

ing a singer’s movements on stage.
Many potential viewers might

assume Brooks’s style is too low
nrow, but that IS not the case. The

ﬁlm is a ﬁne blend of intellectual
humor and scenes that are funny on
any level.

“I would never sacrifice a laugh
for anything that is construed as
intellectually important,” Brooks
has said. “Yet people can laugh
their heads off and still hate a
picture. To me, laughter must be
contained within the framework of
an intelligent, logical, emotional
experience. ”

cock’s “Psycho.” Brooks’ new film, “High Anxiety,”
uses several of Hitchcock's famous scenes.

To give “High Anxiety” a place
among the other ﬁlms Brooks has
done is a difﬁcult task. Its place is
most likely somewhere behind
“Blazing Saddles” and “The
Producers” and ahead of “Young
Frankenstein” and “Silent
Movie.” The only other comedy
ﬁlm of the year that could approach

“Anxiety” would be Al1en’s
“Annie Hall.” Elite company,
indeed.

“I draw no lines whatsoever,”
Brooks has said. “Laughter is
what I'm paid for.”

And laugh is what the audience
does for some 90 minutes.

Katz on 99¢ Theater

By MICHAEL X. ZELENAK

As the $.99 Floating Theater
Festival prepares for the opening of
“TAUDshow” tomorrow night at
Carlow College, many questions
have arisen about the program.
The festival’s last
Squat’s “Pig/Child/Fire,” played
to capacity crowds and has sparked
a lively debate about the Festival,
its direction and its future.

“Last week the Floating Theater
was awarded a $7,500 grant for the
National Endowment for the Arts.
Leon Katz, professor of speech and
theatre arts at Pitt and director of
the Floating Theater, was asked to
clarify some of these questions.

“The ﬁrst and most important
objective of the Floating Theater,”

production, '

' alternative not

Katz said, “is to bring to
Pittsburgh an excellent and varied
sampling of alternative theater
groups. Its second objective is to
bring theater at its most relevant to
special groups in Pittsburgh that
would normally have no access to
it, for example, senior citizens or
prison inmates. Finally, the
Floating Theater is trying to kindle
a cooperative effort among differ-
ent cities and campuses to
exchange programs and book
companies and establish the
visibility of and a tradition for
alternative theater.”

But, just what is “alternative”
theater? Alternative theater is an
simply to the
theater of frivolity that preoccupies
much of the professional stage, but

it is a revolt against the entire
tradition of Western “literary”
theater, where words, dialogue,
verbal metaphors and overt intel-
lectuality have become dominant.
It is an effort to return theater to its
roots since, after all, “drama”
comes from the Greek word
meaning “to do” or “act,” not “to
speak.”

Katz, himself the author of such
acclaimed plays as “Swellfoot’s
Tears” and “Justine,” produced in

“F erber”--A Good Portrait of a Writer

By PATTY TASCARELLA

Pitt News Staff Writer

Edna Ferber
Julie Goldsmith Gilbert
Doubleday

Since the early twenties, Edna
Ferber has been a giant in American
theater, ﬁction and films. The
creator of the novels “Cimarron,”
“So Big” and “Saratoga Trunk”
(all of which were adapted as
screenplays), Ferber collaborated
with the likes. of George S. Kaufman
on “The Royal Family.” But her
pleasure came only from her work.
Ferber mass-produced in an effort
to compensate for her lack of
feminine charms (she resembled a

mole physically and though known
for her wit, Ferber used her cutting
tongue past full advantage.)

Author Julie Gilbert, Ferber’s
grandniece, recounts Ferber’s life
honestly, if compassionately, and
she manages to keep a distance
from her subject (although there are
an incredible number of snapshots
of Gilbert in the photo sections).
The research in “Ferber” is
nothing short of phenomenal-
Gilbert interviewed hundreds of
“Aunt Ed’s” acquaintences, inclu-
ding Katherine Hepburn, Richard
Rodgers and Garson Kanin.

Gilbert's format for the book has
a reverse chronological style that.
unfortunately, is uneffective and
distracting. The book is saved only
by the ﬁne writing.

The major focus is on the 1920's
and 1930’s, when Ferber was a
regular at the Algonquin Round
Table and met with New York’s
ﬁnest wits—Dorothy Parker, Kauf-
man, Alexander Woolcott, and
Robert Benchley among them—for
lunchtime sessions of putdowns.
Woolcott and Ferber were often at
odds: once, Ferber came attired in
the latest Paris fashion, a broad-
shouldered suit.

Woolcott tried to get in a dig by
commenting, “Why, Edna, you
almost look like a man.”

Ferber ﬁred back, “Why, Alec,
so do you.”

The exchanges between the two
became so heated that efforts by the
rest of the table could not patch up
the argument, and ﬁnally, Ferber

refused to have anything to do with
the round table.

To make up for her failure to
attract men, Ferber bragged
constantly about the time she
devoted to her work. Once at a party
at the Rodgers’, Ferber sounded off
about starting off as a reporter when
she was 16 and grilled the other
guests about their careers until she
was satisﬁed she had begun the
earliest. Playwright Anita Loos
(“Gentlemen Prefer Blondes”) sat
quietly until F erber noticed her and
smugly demanded to know Loos’s
age when she started to write
professionally. “I sold my ﬁrst
scenario when I was twelve," Loos
replied to a silenced Ferber.

The private Ferber was a complex

woman who hid her feelings behind ,

a facade of superiority and
wisecracks. She grew up in poverty.
supported her family from the time
she found her ﬁrst job, and blamed
her weakling of a father for the
family’s situation. After his death,
Ferber cared for her mother lavishly
but resented the burden of the old
woman with whom she often fought.
Unable to admit her annoyance,
Ferber transferred her hatred to her
only sister, Fanny, and to make up
for her lack of a family, she would
tag after married couples. The
threesomes never lasted long

because Ferber would view the wife‘.

in the same light asiher mother and
sister. She never understood the
psychology of transference and
would blame the wife as being
jealous of her talent. V

H Starship Scores With Album--Minor Miracles

By PHILIP SCALAMOGNA
Jefferson Starship
Earth

Grunt

Three years ago Jefferson

Sears highlights the music with
delectable piano work, while
adding rich permeating sound on
the synthesizer. David Freiberg’s
lively bass proves him as a good
supporting musician. The same
can be said for Paul Kantner and

jumping off the ride at 30 miles an
hour. Iron brains and ball bearings
give him the power.”

Beginning the second side, Balin
really lets loose on “Fire.” He
really jams the emotion into his

voice, giving the song a lot of
feeling. -

The following piece, “Show
Yourself,” is another song remin-
iscent of the group’s earlier days of
social comment. The song vividly
displays the end of old ﬂag-waving
ideals. “I believed in you. It was
so easy then. But where are you
now?” Slick asks. “There are
children dying Rx you. That
doesn’t sound like freedom to me.”

“Runaway” follows as another
easy rocker highlighted by Balin’s
vocals and Chaquico’s sweet
guitar-picking. The music ﬁnishes
with “All Nite Long.” All of the
group's vocalists blend into a nice
harmony while they play one last
time in a grand ﬁnish.

’/ I LET'S WORK TOGETHER TO PROTECT
THE UNBORN AND THE

Starship enjoyed its biggest suc-
cess ever with the now-classic
album, “Red Octopus.” Its
following album, “Spitﬁre,” did
not fare nearly as well. It will be
interesting to see how well
“Earth,” the Starship’s latest
product, will do.

“Earth” is a bit spicier and more
interesting than the mellow “Red
Octopus.” The album features
more variety in sound and more
instrumentation in the music. For
example, there is more use of
organ and synthesizer in “Earth.”
In addition, some of the songs are
reminiscent of Jefferson Airplane
and early Starship. However,
“Earth,” also retains much of the
good melodic content of “Red
Octopus,” making it a well-balan-
ced and well-composed piece of
music.

Craig Chaquico whose steady work
on rhythm guitars give form to the
music. Drummer John Barbata
moves the song with a steady beat.

“Count on Me” and “Crazy
Feelin' ” are both easy rockers in
which Marty Balin’s rich, expres-
sive voice steals the show. The
former cut also exhibits crisp guitar
work by lead guitarist Chaquico.
Sears augments the latter selection
with a ﬂuid organ.

Slick’s vocal performance shines
on the enjoyable “Take Your
Time.”

A special treat is “Skateboard.”
With a sound reminiscent of the
Airplane, the racy beat hits with
full force as Slick sings, “No

“What happens is that the

that is irrelevant, is shocked into the
realization of the conditions of the

Other Pieces” and “Paradise
Now!”

“I remember the performance of
‘Paradise Now!’ in 1968,” Katz
said. “The theater seated 500. A
thousand people showed up. There
were no seats or aisles or ﬂoor, just
wall-to-wall people; they literally
became part of the woodwork and
wallpaper.

“The Living Theater was not
inﬂuenced by Brecht as much as
many people thought. They had
studied the development of Rus-
sian agit-prop theater in the 1930’s,
especially the Blue Blouse group.
It’s technique was inﬂuenced by
Meyerhold and other Russian
futurists. They sought new staging
techniques and tried to make
movement itself into a vocabulary.
They were the model of alternative
theater in the 1960’s. But, today,
we have new models—the theater
of Wilson and Foreman, and soon, I
believe, the theater of Squat.”

“During the late 1960's,” Katz
continued, “the formal base of
‘avant-guard’ theater works began
shifting away from politics (and
groups like the Living Theater) and
more and more exclusively to the
ritual, processional, the ‘happen-
ing.’ Interacting with this was the
movement towards ‘experiential’
theater in which the unit that we
normally call a ‘theatrical work’
could no longer be defined as ‘this
performance.’ Rather, it became
an ongoing, sequential set of
‘experiences’ that begins with the
formation of the company, its initial
discussions and organization and
goes right through to its last
production of a work.

“In this type of theater the
relation of the actor to the spectator
is in no way a didactic experience,
but a shared experience. The
spectator, in his behavior, becomes
as much a factor in the work as the
‘performance’ itself.”

A major problem confronting the

alternative theater is censorship.
Katz, too, has had to face the
problem of censorship. After the
success of his play “Justine” at
Chatham College, Theatre Express
scheduled a tour of the play that
was to begin at Mt. Lebanon High
School. However, the Mt. Lebanon
School Board decided to ban the
company from the stage and not
allow production of the play on
moral grounds.

“It is perfectly understandable
and I personally believe that a
neighborhood, community or a
class of people has as much right to
voice its moral stance as a
playwright has to voice his,” Katz
said. “The only objection I have is
that my play was censored by the
Mt. Lebanon School Board. The
objections that a neighborhood like
Mt. Lebanon has to a work like
‘Justine’ cannot conceiveably be
out of ‘moral’ conviction. Mt.
Lebanon is well-heeled, sophisti-
cated and perfectly conversant with

METAMORPHOSIS . ..

Is the process of change, of becoming, of something new from something that was.
ACCELERATED READING INSTITUTE is composed exclusively of former EVELYN WOOD READING DYNAMICS
teachers. For years, our students have told us that there are only two aspects of the E.W.R.D.gcourse that they have found objectionable:

(1) lt’s too long.
We agree!

(2) It’s too expensive.

Come to our FREE demonstration and see how our total emersion seminars have eliminated these two problems.

Do you find it exasperating to go into a final exam having completed only 50% of your required reading? Do you ever feel
inadequate when called upon in class to comment on some unread material? Were you ever frustrated by a professor who gave out
reading assignments as if his was the only course that you had to read for?

If the answer to any of these questions is “yes,” then we can help you.

Through our total emersion, you can be reading 5 to 10 times faster before your next exam. You may even DOUBLE your
reading speed, simply by attending one FREE demonstration.

We can provide you with everything you needpto be a successful student: increased reading speed; excellent comprehension; an
organized study method; and improved recall. The only elements that you must provide time, energy, and enthusiasm. _

Swmmers Receive Galen Panthrs’ t-in- 11ie-Ann

Seeing the swim team’s bank book fattening with
every win, Pitt swim coach Dick Bradshaw has
realized what a winning record does to an athletic
program in terms of dollars and cents.

, Bradshaw, who this season has guided the Pan-
thers to their best record in 30 years, reported that
alumni contributions to the swim program from the
Golden Panthers (Pitt’s very influential alumni
group) are five times as much as they were when he
became coach almost six years ago.

According to Bradshaw, alumni contributions in
1972 totalled $2,000 dollars, with the most generous
contributor donating $200. This year, Bradshaw ex-
pects the total figure to jump to $10,000.

“We started out with very little,” Bradshaw said.
“Now, we have quite a bit as far as alumni con-
tributions are concerned. ’ ’

‘Bradshaw, familiar with the shot-in-the-arm effect
such support can create in the long-range goals of
any athletic program, has to be heartened by Golden
Panther spokesman Bob Heddleston’s report that
alumni contributions are supposed to grow at a
similar rate in the future. \

Heddleston, executive director of the Golden Pan-
thers, said contributions to the swim program could
grow “twice as much” in the future. Heddleston
also said that behind football and basketball, swim-
ming is the biggest money-making sport at Pitt.

The funny part of the matter is the fact that Pitt

athletic director Cas Myslinski denies the swim’
program has gotten any increased ﬁnancial backing
from the alumni. ,

“The only backing they’re getting is their (the

 

alumni’s) increased attendance,” Myslinski said-

“The swim team is beginning to grow,” Myslinski
added. “We’re getting better swimmers. We have a
first-class facility (Trees Pool). It’s like the domino
theory. First, you get one or two good swimmers,
then one or two more the year after, then one or two
more the year after that until you’ve reached a point
where you have a very strong and very successful
program.

‘ “Our alumni realize this,” Myslinski continued.
“That’s why they’re so quick to support the team in
terms of attendance.”

Myslinski did confirm a report that Pitt is seriously
considering giving financial backing to Pantherette

all-America Kathy Stetler when she competes in

AAU Nationals later this season.

If it should decide to support Stetler, a precedent
would be set. In the past, the athletic department has
steered clear of giving any of its swimmers, com-
peting under the AAU banner, any expenses what-
soever.

“Kathy Stetler creates another problem,” Myslin-
ski said. “We don’t want to be putting money down
the drain as far as our AAU swim program is con-
cerned. We consider AAU competition to be differ-
ent than that on the varsity level since so many swim-
mers who compete on our AAU program aren't even
students at Pitt.

“But in the case of Stetler, we have to reevaluate
our goals. Since she has the potential to make the
United States Olympic team, we have to consider that
Stetler could be representing Pitt in her future years,
too. Say if she does make the Olympic team, she not
only would be wearing the colors and ofﬁcial
uniform of the United States, she would also be
representing Pitt.

Stetler’s situation is one of the many that point to
the continued financial support of the Pitt swim
program. Although Myslinski denies it, it won’t be
play money the athletic department will have to dish
out if it should decide to foot the bill for such a trip.

Instead, it will be the real green stuff, the kind that
Bradshaw, realizing the importance. of a winning
season in terms of monetary value, has come to know
in the past year.

W Pitt Finishes Fourth in East

By JIM LEWIS
Pitt News Staff Writer

BLOOMSBURG, Pa.——The Pitt
wrestling team ﬁnished fourth in
the Eastern Wrestling League
(EWL) Tournament last weekend,
garnering 52 team points and
sending five wrestlers—118-

- under Glenn Maxwell, 126-
_ _,.ounder Jose Martinez, 134-
pounder Rande Stottlemyer, 1.90-
pounder Bill Bailey and heavy-
weight Mark Stepanovich——to the
NCAA National Championships
March 15-18.

“I was a bit disappointed at our
fourth-place ﬁnish," Panther head
coach Dave Adams said. “But,
realistically, Ifelt that was what we
should have taken——plus anywhere
in the neighborhood of ﬁve to seven
wrestlers. Less than that, I would
have been disappointed.”

ahead of Clarion (35), Lock Haven

(24‘/2) and West Virginia (11‘/2)‘

despite forfeiting three matches

 

and obtaining two byes which
deprived Pitt of early points.

Freshmen Mike Bond (150
pounds) and Tom Jones (158
pounds) were injured in their ﬁrst
round matches and had to forfeit
the rest of their bouts. Bond lost to
second-seeded Ron Standridge of
Clarion by defaulting in the last
seven seconds of the match and
Jones was pounded by Penn State
top-seed Dave Becker, 18-3, to
knock them out of the competition
with two losses.

Panther 142-pound freshman
Steve Gouletas and 177-pound
senior George 0’Kom were elimi-
nated later. O’Kom lost two bouts
in a row—to Nittany Lion Dan
Pfautz, 24-10, and to Clarion’s Jay
Hockenbrock by fall at 2:58.
Gouletas lost a disputed ﬁrst-round
match to Clarion’s Dave Merriam,

qualifying for a chance to be picked
as one of the three wildcard
qualiﬁers. However, the seven
coaches voted to send Pitt
heavyweight Mark Stepanovich (a
third-place winner after a 6-5 loss
to champion Tim Payne of
Cleveland State), and 158-pounder
Toby Matney and 177-pounder Les
Steidl of Cleveland State.

“I was disappointed about
Gordon,” Adams said. “He
wrestled well enough to become a
wildcard.‘ But it all boiled down to
who the other coaches felt would do

Overcome Adversity

ANNAPOLIS, Md.—Ove1\-

coming the adversity that usually
mars Pitt hockey club road trips, the
Panthers shook offa surprising 10-3
loss Saturday by ﬁghting back to
gain a ‘4-4 tie Sunday against a
tough Naval Academy squad.

Avenging an earlier loss at the
Pitt Candle Light Tournament, the
Midshipmen squared the season
series at one win apiece with one
game ending in a tie. Saturday’s
win was the first time Navy, now
13-3-1, had defeated Pitt (12-8-1) in
four years.

The Panthers met up with their
road misfortune, beginning Friday
when seven inches of snow fell in
Delaware and cancelled Pitt's stop-
there. Then, the two sets of referees
here proved quality hockey ofﬁcials
are not a common commodity south
of the Mason-Dixon line.

Both games tended to get out of
control at times, but even though
Pitt felt at times it was being
“homered, ’ ’ the penalties ended up
nearly equal in both contests.

Some errant passing in their
defensive zone caused the Panthers
to come unraveled Saturday. Not
only was Pitt outshot, 48-35, in the
opener, it spotted Navy a 2-0 lead on
defensive miscues and forced goalie
Larry Newell into doing triple duty
by not clearing the puck well.

In the other end, Pitt applied
pressure on veteran goalie Bill
Hanna, who stopped some hard
shots by the Panthers, some of
which he didn’t even see. One he
didn’t see and didn’t stop was a
powerplay slapshot by Curt Hetz
from just inside the blue line to
make it 2-1.

The Panthers were behind, 4-2
and 5-3, when Navy blew the game
wide open with five straight goals,
four on the power play and one
short-handed.

Pitt's other two goals, both in the
second period, came on Larry
Gs.llick’s shot from behind the net,
which caromed off Hanna's stick
and a tip-in by Tim Duffy with
assists going to Gallick and Tom
Sherwin.

The Midshipmen, who were led

 

by veteran Bill Dooley’s four goals,
limited the Panthers to one shot on
goal in the third period.

But after a little bit of soul
searching following the loss, the
Panthers were determined to take

Sports

the rubber match.

Still, penalties plagued Pitt with
two powerplay goals and a
successful -penalty shot by Dooley,
who scored twice against the
Panthers on Sunday to cap his
productive weekend. '

Pitt took a 1-0 lead on some
hard-working individual effort by
Gallick, who missed a partial break
and stole the puck back seconds
later and scored.

Then the Panthers frequent
penalties began to hurt them.
Playing with a two-man advantage,
the Middies tied it at 1-1 just 12
seconds into the second period on
Dooley’s powerplay goal, then took
the lead after the official whistled a
penalty shot after a Pitt infraction,

which did not appear to be a clean -

breakaway by Dooley. Dooley
cashed on the penalty by dekeing
Newell to the left and keeping the
puck on the ice to the right side.
Late in the second period, Navy
went up, 3-1, but Pitt's Dave Elson
scored on a partial break in the ﬁnal
minute. i
The Panthers, directed by
assistant coach Bob Montgomery
due to the illness of Len Barcalow,
tied it three minutes into the ﬁnal
period on a’ slapshot from the point
by Gary Fries during a Pitt
powerplay. Pitt, outshot, 51-38,
went ahead with 11 minutes
remaining on a close-in goal by
Hetz, but Navy stormed back to tie it
at 4-4 a minute later. .
The Panthers, who host Ohio
State’a hockey club in a pair of
games next weekend at the Lake
Vue Ice Rink, played with a man
advantage for the last ﬁve minutes
and two men up the last 1:45, but
could not score the game winner.

Gymnasts Host EAIAW Meet  

By SUE McFARLAND

Coach Donna DeMarino will
have two goals this weekend as the
women gymnasts host the EAIAW
regional championship, while at-
tempting to gain a berth to the
national championships to be held
later this month in Seattle.

The two-day competition will
showcase 14 Eastern teams.
including top-ranked Clarion and
Penn State, in addition to the
llth-rated Pantherettes. Also
featured at the meet will be Penn
State's Ann Carr. America's
top-ranked gymnast the past two
years.

Penn State has the highest
average team score, with a 147.08,
followed by Clarion and Pitt with
averages of 146.23 and 137.73
respectively. DeMarino is quite
confident of her team’s ability to
secure a place in the national
championships.

“All Ican say right now is that I
wouldn’t put anything out of our
reach." DeMarino said. “Every-
one is really psyched and going into
this thing with the feeling that we

have everything to gain and
nothing to lose."
DeMarino has stepped up

practices in anticipationof the
weekend competition, with work-
outs on Saturday and Sunday (in
addition to the usual three-hour
daily sessions) and an intrasquad
meet on Monday. She said her
team of young gymnasts has
responded well to the rigorous
training sessions, and, although
fatigued, the team has not let up in
practice. ‘

“We’ve had a lot of injuries that
under normal conditions would
require some time off from
competition, but, because of
regionals, everybody is just gritting
their teeth and trying to get in as
much practice as possible,” De-
Marino said.

The women have not competed
since Feb. 21, but DeMarino
believes the team’s inaction will
not be a factor in the champion-
ships. “By not competing I think it
took a lot of pressure off the team,
and allowed them more time to
work on new moves," DeMarino
said.

She stressed the importance of
fan support on the Pantherettes’
road to success in the regional
competition.

“You might say that we aren’t
competing on our home floor
because the competition is being
held at the Field House instead of
at Trees Hall. but we will have the
advantage of having our home fans
there," DeMarino said.

“I try to convince people to
attend the meets by the ‘try-it.
you'll-like-it method.’ " DeMarino
said, “and usually once they've
seen a meet they find it so
fascinating and exciting they just
keep coming back for more."

year. The Pantherettes have
improved their performances in
regional championships, ﬁnishing
21st in 1975, 14th in the 1976
season and seventh last year.

“What really bugs me more than
anything else is when people,
especially the media, comment on
the fact that our program has come
out of nowhere this year, which
isn't the truth,” DeMarino said. “I
think we owe a lot to people like
Regina Carson, Alison Hoburg and
Cyndee Severyn who have carried
the program these past years."

DeMarino believes that ‘ this
should be the best regional
championship to be held anywhere ‘
this year due to the caliber of teams
within the Eastern region.

“I was very happy when Pitt
received the bid for regionals.
Everything is going our way. I
guess luck is with us."

Pitt News Staff Writer

BLOOMSBURG, Pa.—Pitt 134-
pounder Rande Stottlemyer had no
right qualifying for the NCAA
Championships at Maryland March
15-18, and Panther 167-pounder
Jim Gordon had every right. But,
with a little intestinal fortitude and
without needed votes, the opposite
occurred.

Stottlemyer, who suffered a
severe left ankle sprain in a dual
match against Ohio State a week
before the Eastern Wrestling
League (EWL) Tournament, hop-
ped around on crutches for most of
the week prior to the event. He
couldn’t put any weight on the
ankle and was forced to wrestle
with his left leg completely
bandaged and constantly kept in
ice. To beat competition like Penn
State’s Bernie Fritz and Clarion’s
Randy Miller with only one good
leg is highly unlikely.

Gordon, meanwhile, with a 13-6
duel meet record which included
four bouts at the 177-pound slot,
was seeded fourth of the seven
wrestlers in the 167-pound weight
class. He had good chances of
finishing first or second and thus
qualifying for the College Park trip
when he drew Clarion’s Jim
Herbert (who he beat, 7-4, in early
February’s 31-9 Pitt victory) in the
opening round.

-THE Prrr NEws——wednesday, March 8. 1978

 Sta ttlemyer Qualifies Despite Injury

But predictabilities died when
Gordon fell to Herbert in the first
round, 6-2, and Stottlemyer won
two overtime decisions-4-1 over
Fritz and 2-0 over Mi1ler—to earn a
berth in the NCAA’s.

Stottlemyer’s performance was
amazing; his participation was in
doubt.

“Very much in doubt,” Pitt head
coach Dave Adams claimed. “In
doubt up to the day of the
tournament."

But Stottlemyer rallied with
seconds left in both bouts, earning
single points on opponents’
mistakes—Fritz was called for
pushing off against Stottlemyer in
the last 10 seconds of his match,
making the score 8-8, and putting
the match into overtime. Miller
slammed the Pitt senior and was
penalized one point, tying that
contest at 6-6.

Then Stottlemyer took over with
what ability a bum leg couldn’t
stop, decisioning Fritz 4-1, and
holding off Miller 2-0 in overtime.

“I never saw a guy put on a
guttier performance,” Adams said.
“I don't think 99 percent of the
would would have attempted to
wrestle. He displayed more intesti-
nal fortitude at that tournament
than most people would display in a
lifetime.”

For 22 minutes that weekend,
Stottlemyer pulled everything to-
gether to qualify for the NCAA’s
for the third time in his Pitt career:
He forfeited his championship
match against Cleveland State’s
Bill Walsh, an opponent he pinned
at Navy in late January, so his
ankle would have that much more
time to heal for Maryland.

“He didn't want to give the title
away,” Adams said, “but the job
for him was to qualify—that’s what
we were hoping for.”

“Somebody was watching us,”
Stottlemyer said. ‘‘I have strong
religious convictions and I think
that had a lot to do with it.”

But things weren’t looking up for
Gordon. Although he lost to
Herbert in the first round, 6-2, he
defeated Blooms%urg’s captain
Andy Cappelli, 11-5 and came back
to shut out Herbert for the chance
to be one of the three wildcard
entries chosen by the coaches, 3-0.
Gordon was impressive, but not
impressive enough to sway four or
five opposing coaches.

“The coaches’ big criteria for not
selecting Gordon was that the guys
that were selected had been to the
NCAA‘s twice already,” Adams
said.

Meanwhile Stottlemyer has
March 15-18 to look forward to.

Pantherettes E|iminated,93-71” 

By PATTY TASCARELLA

Pin News Staff Writer

The Pantherette basketball
squad was eliminated from post-
season play Friday night in the ﬁrst
round of the EAIAW playoffs by
Immaculata, 93-71.

Despite a ﬁne performance by
sophomore center Wanda Ran-
dolph, who tossed a game-high 35
points (Randolph, Pitt’s career
scoring leader, passed the 1,000
point mark in the game). Pitt was
outclassed from the start.
Immacu1ata’s offense was too
potent to contain, particularly since
the Pantherettes were ‘playing
without the services of defensive
specialist Barb Welsh, who left the
team last week.

Immaculata defeated host team
Edinboro Saturday to advance to
next week’s semiﬁnal round. Pitt
edged out Penn State, 80-79, in the
consolation game, as Debbie Lewis

scored 27 points and Randolph
added 26. Randolph also had 22
rebounds to go with the 16 she
hauled in against Immaculata.

The Pantherettes ﬁnished the
season with a 14-14 record, their
worst in four years, but coach Jean
Balthaser said she was (not
disappointed with the team’s
showing.

“We lost a lot of close games that
we should have won,” Balthaser
said, citing inexperience and
injuries as the prime reasons. “A lot
of the younger players were much
improved by the end of the season,
though.”

On the plus side for Pitt,
Randolph had a season’s scoring
average of 18.5 points per game,
three points less that last year, and
the 6-3 center also averaged 13.8
rebounds each outing. Randloph
led the Pantherettes in blocked
shots with 93 on the season, nearly
four per game, and led Pitt in

assists with 106 (close to ﬁve per
game). Welsh and Stephanie
Stripling both averaged 8.5 points
per game and hauled in 6.2 and 6.1
rebounds, respectively. Welsh, a
big threat from the foul line
connected on 79 percent of her free
throws and 79 percent of her ﬁeld
goals, the highest on the team in
both categories.

“It’s hard to be enthusiastic
about a 14-14 record,” Balthaser
said, “but many new players
learned a lot for next year.”

PANTHERETTE NOTES: The
Pantherettes went as far in the
playoffs as they did last year when
they were eliminated by St.
Joseph’s...Pitt’s regular season
competition included eight nation-
ally ranked teams, double the
number from last year...The
Pantherettes will lose Kim
Raymond (injured most of the
season), _Diane Zaken and Mimi
Senkowski to graduation.

Five Qualify for Nationals

(Continued from Page 19)
NCAA’s since all-America
Stottlemyer went as a freshman in
1974, clobbered Bloomsburg’s
Mike Nock, 10-4, after receiving a
bye in the ﬁrst round. His hopes of
taking the weight class champion-
ship ended when Nittany Lion Mike
DeAugustino decisioned him, 7-4.

Martinez also received a bye in
the ﬁrst round, then eeked out a
5-1 overtime victory over
Bloomsburg’s Tom Fink when
Fink, thinking the regulation time
was over, allowed Martinez an
escape and a take down with only
three seconds left to tie the score,
13-13. Clarion’s Tom Diamond
pinned Martinez in the champion-
ship match at 4:43.

Stottlemyer, with a severely
sprained left ankle that required
the taping of his entire leg,
struggled past PSU’s Bernie Fritz

in overtime, 4-1, and Clarion’s
Randy Miller (also in overtime),
2-0, to qualify. He forfeited his
championship match to Cleveland
State’s Bill .Walsh to settle for
second place.

“I’m deﬁnitely disappointed,”
Stottlemyer said, “but we've got
what I wanted—to qualify—and
that’s what is important.”

Bailey never lost a match-
pinning Lock Haven’s Tim
Thompson at 7:14 in the first
round, thumping Clarion’s Eric

"Booth, 4-0, and decisioning Penn

State’s Sam Sallitt in the champion-
ship match, 11-5, to become the
Panthers’ only weight class cham-
pion of the tournament and Pitt’s

second all-time match winner in
history behind Stottlemyer.
Stepanovich seemed to be
cruising to a championship title,
edging PSU’s Rick Snyder, 5-4, but
a 6-5 loss to Payne ruined his
chances. Stepanovich pinned West
Virginia’s Jim Gump and held off
Lock Haven’s Gregg Koontz, 4-0,
to steal third place and be picked as
one of the three wi1dcards—thus
giving Pitt ﬁve qualiﬁers and a
chance to keep its national rankingzf

“The next ranking is based on
the teams’ potential in the national
tournament," Adams said. “To be
in the top twenty, you have to take
about ﬁve wrestlers at the least and
have to have two that do something
once they’re there.”
