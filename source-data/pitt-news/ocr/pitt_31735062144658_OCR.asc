‘The_Sunset Dinner last Saturday
was a decided success, -voted’ by al-

1  .most‘,-everybody the. best Sunset Din-

nenwe have ever had. I-leretofore
all the laurels have gone to the first
one‘ held in 1919 butjnow some seem
to have shifted to this 1ast'one.«~ The
,c‘om_inittee"' which work'ed,it up en.-
‘-‘d'ea-vored to have an altogether infor-
mal party with no set vprograin, and
' the ’co-mmittee‘ did just that.

‘All diners were .p,r'qvid'ed with
«badges for which Bernice Storey, ’l9,
They were most at-
tractive, made up of the seals, used
in the Cathedral Campaign, showing
a.-picture of the Cathedral on a blue
3 background, Superimposed . and" across
the face was “Sunset Dinner. 1925*’
in gold letters. Adorned with gold‘
‘ ribbon they; made lovely memeutoes

lvera Hamstrom, '21, and Anna Adams,
’20_, as ticket sellers and. general
money takers, handled the crowd of
_two hundred and twenty-ﬁve gmost
«[efﬁciently.'.,>   . .

Before ' the dinner, after much
.megaphoning, we were‘ assembled be-
fore Alumni Hall to have our picture
taken. --All our efforts at stooping
and climbing in order to have every-
body v'isib1e—s1,1ould be rewarded, but
that remainsuto be seen. The pictures
at sixty cents each may be ordered
through Miss Buckley, but all orders
should come in without delay.

All the reunion classes had special
tables and -so were admitted to the
Heinz House ﬁrst. They -were greet-
ed with a sight worth remembering.
The fact that the committee, headed
by Dorothy" Stewart Nicklas, ’23, was
at work‘ at SeV'ell‘?‘O’ClG,Ck ‘Saturday
morning is sufficient“explanation of
why everything was so“-lovely; Eight
long ‘tables radiated from the plat-
form in front of the ﬁreplace, and
each.ta.ble was decorated with numer-
ous vases ‘ of flowers,’ for which
‘tha_nks.is due to many for contribu-
tions but-particularly to Louise and

It has been the custom "to present a.sVl1‘or1: resume of the football‘ pros-

‘will be “Stadium Year” and. everyone is especiallyv-anxious to know how‘

for thought"’_duri"ng the,sum.m-er: _ , .. . 1 .
Let itiflrst be said that the stadium construction work is in excellent,
shape, and there -is no 'questiVo_n about the big field being. ready for the
opening game withiwashlngton and L"ee,__Septemb'er 26. TVh'eVplaylng field
has”been sewed, and grVass'is now‘ growing. More than half the concrete
seat banks“ have been ve'r*ecte‘cl, and the contractors estimated that by‘ July
15 this work_will be completed. The seat brackets and seat strips are are

big items for completion of the oVuterVstrVu‘cture. The work on the roadways‘)
and sewers around the stadium is ‘in’ good shape,»ar1d the contractors are
now working on the details under the stands which include the dressing.
rooms, entrances, basket ball pavilion, 'etc.»V. it was just one year ago that
official word was received’ "from the Board _of Trustees, through Chancellor‘
Bowman, that the stadium work could proceed.--..Much has been accomplished
in that one-yearnand a dream has become a reality. - '-
‘ PROSPECTS BRIGHT

.Wil:h' these fine facilities for athletics, it is, of course, Very desirable
that Pitt have-as winning team, and thciwholesituation can- be summed up in’
, Of course, in the development
of a. football team almost anything may happen which will throw ‘the plans of
the coaches awry, but with any reasonable kind of luck Pitt should have
one of thebest teams in its history and make’ a fine record even with the.
very'har¢d" schedule which is encountered. To get down to brass tacks. ln
the State game last year the lineup was as follows: ' 1

Left end, McMillen; left tackle, Wissingcr; left guard, Hangartner; ceni‘
ter, Johnson; right guard, Captain Frank; right tackle, Chase;,_ right end,

ing; ,fu“llback, Gustafson. All .thes.'e‘."mcn will be available except Johnson
and Frank. The substitutes -ln‘that game were as follows: Linn, Gwosden,
Sauc'_r,gHarrls, Akins, Ashbaugh,._S.te,cle‘ and Irwin. Gwosden, Sauer, Akins,
Ashbaugh, and-possibly Harris, will notbe available. Amann and Joe
Schmitt are other letter men oflast year who_'dld not ‘get in’ that game and
who will be-available. 1 '1 ‘ , ' -

__ Coach Sutherland wlll*be in charge for -his secondyear, andeven better‘
things can‘ be expected of hlm'than_m his Initial year of coaching, here, as
-he has.-a better knowledge of the men and conditions. .Jock’s record in 1924
was slightly better than that of 1923, the victories over West. Virginia and?

vious year, being outstanding". Floyd Rose, who has been an old standby in
athletic coaching circles at Pitt formany years, has been compelled to
drop out on account of press of personal business, and everyoneswill miss‘,
him. Sutherland will have a competent coaching’ staff of assistants, however,
in Alex» Stevenson, chalky Williamson» and March Johnson. Dr. T-. R. Kend-'
rick will again be the team physician."’' . ‘

The season opened with ‘a dual
meet at West Virginia, and‘ found the
yearlings on the short -end of a '77-49
score. The men with only a short
time practice on an improvised ﬁeld,
found themselves meeting a foe key-
ed to the minute, having practiced
on a ﬁne cinder path enclosedwithin
the new mountaineer stadium. Of
the -fourteen events scheduled the
Panthers took four, namely: a ﬁrst
in the half mile, the discus, the broad
jump, and. the shot put. V Welch show-
ed his friends from the Mountaineer
state a thing or two when he -rung
up a total of eighteen points for the
meet, scoring ﬁrsts in-three ﬁeld ev-
ents: On the cinder path, Roy found
it easy to win the half mile. Kamp-
meyer was a, good second, Crawford,
second in the hundred, and Rutter,
third. in the 220 and quarter mile,
helped Pitt make, a fair score. Nor-
ris, the "colored" Vboy from the hill,
made seconds in both the hurdles. He
did some. fast stepping in these ev-
ents, only to be sq1_1eezed‘out for first
-honors -by ‘ small'mar_giris. Rearick
