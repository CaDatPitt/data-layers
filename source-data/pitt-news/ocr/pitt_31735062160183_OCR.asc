Publications Board .  

To Consider Issue

By JACK MARKOWITZ » ‘

The Panther controversy will be carried into a major
publications board meeting tomorrow afternoon.

According to Dean of Men Theodore W. Biddle, chair-~

man of the board, a “clean-up” of the Panther willebe on
the agenda for discuission, “considering the temper of some

people.”

The issue was thrown into the board’s lap last week,’

when Men’s Council and the Newman Club asked University

oﬁicials and Panther editors to‘

take steps to “clean up” the stu-
dent humor magazine.

The Newman Cl_ub sent copies
of its resolution -to 16 campus or-
ganizations, social and religious,
and several fraternities and soror-
ities are discussing the Panther in
meetings this week. .

New Editors To Be Picked

The Panther case is expected to
get special emphasis at tomorrow’s
meeting of the 21-member board,
since a main item on the agenda
is the election of an editor and
business manager of the maga-
zine for next year. The board
made up of students, administra-.
tion and faculty, serves as the pub-
lisher of student publications.

Opposition to ,,the Panther’s
humor has occurred since the
revival of the magazine on cam-

Air Travel £J.C’heap :
Costs. Only 256 i
For 250 Miles A

The Spring Festival com-
mittee has discovered one of
the cheapest means of travel
yet developed.

A trip was recently made to .
Dalton, New York, a distance
of about 250 miles, at the cost
of approximately 25 cents.

The method? The Long
Distance Balloon Contest of
Spring Festival.

Last Thursday when the.
helium-ﬁlled balloons were
released, cards were attached
asking the ﬁnder of the bal-
loon to return the card with
their name and ‘address. Over
the weekend, approximately
20 cards returned in the mail.
The one -from Dalton had
traveled farthest.

’52 ODK’ Senior Awardee -— Who?

‘ Tap Day ceremonies Wednesday will see one senior man¢
getting the most durable honor conferred on a Pitt student.
, At least. a half-dozen strong candidates ‘are possibilities
for the -Omicron Delta Kappa Senior Award, which includes

in the stone of ODK Walk.

But to most candidates the
stone-engraving is less important
than the great weight the award
has with prospective employers
and‘ graduate schools.

The man given the best chance
to cop l952’s award is Student‘
Congress President Cyril Wecht,
who numbers his activities in two
digits. But Wecht has never been
tapped to the ODK, leadership

   

the carving of the awardee’s name¢

an ODK member could be raised
in his candidacy for the Walk
award. ‘

Other strong candidates in stu-
dent activities and politics are Bob
Gardner, Congress vice-president,
and Bill McKinley, president of
ODK. Either of the two ODK men
could win, but some students think
that McKinley and Gardner votes
are balanced by Wecht’s, and that
a compromise candidate might get

  
 
 

football captain Bob Brennan, and
head cheerleader Jack Hardman,
all possible ‘candidates, would
probably stand a better chance if
a deadlock does develop on the se-
lecting committee. _

While the machinery of the
committee is no secret, the dis-
cussions it has had this year in
deciding the awardee will proba-
bly never be madeepublics

the contractors forgot an im-

put enough mortar between the

» The following is an exact copy of the resolution the
Newman Club sent to religious organizations, the dean of

, , We, the Newman Club of the University of Pittsburgh,
have been forced by our principles of decent literature,
to present the following resolution to the Editor of the Pitt

,a.-: Stand, our Opinion

Panther is of more thanpassing interest to the students
who have bought it and who may buy it‘, we have d,,ev_oted

'»this‘ page to the ‘controversy which grew out of the True

Concessions edition. We have turned over most of. the
page to our readers and, somehow, we think that by pre-
P-senting their views instead of our own, we are running

A ourbest page of the year.

‘ iOur stand remains substantially the same as we ex-
" pressed it last week. We agree with the Newmans in their
charges that the parody issue was vulgar; we agree with

;‘"f'th'em in their feeling that this is unnecessary and we

’.agree that the Panther could be written on a higher level

it P than it often is. But, here, our agreement ends.

We denythat True Concessions will have any eﬁect
on our morals, that it will degenerate campus honor, that
“ it is an insult to our intelligences and that it ‘is base or

" evenirgpulsive. Again, we say it was a poor attempt at

humor and a casegof misguided judgement. »
_ , A We do not feel that the Panther staff is inherently de-
praved, that they have a criminal lack of moral sense, or

- that their intention was to corrupt- We think that the New-

‘- A mans, by exercising their right to cri,ticize,shave reminded
‘pthe editors that many people arepunhappy about their

humor, and we think that this warning is sufficient.

We see no reason why they shouldlso relentlessly and

mirthlessly pursue the Panther down to the bitter end. One
sin"is' notat all indicative of basic corruption. Just as the
Newmans erred in injecting the standards of the Legion of
Decency into the issue, so did the Panther err in its judge-
ment of humor. ,
’ As we said before, we think that the Newmans action,
while not directly a form of censorship, will have the eﬁect
 of restrictingthe contents of the Panther to meet a cer-
tain set of standards which are by no means accepted uni-

 ‘versally. Again, we hope that all o-f the groups supporting

ithe resolution will reconsider their action, place some faith

 .in‘the Panther staff, and await the next edition.

Since publication of this Reso-

lution reaction on campus has.

aroused much comment. Fears
of censorship—-loss of freedom
of the press-—puritanism——-prud-

ery——have been expressed in a.

recent edition of The Pitt News.
Contrasted to this attitude is

the offices of the Dean of Men

and the Dean of Women, the di- *
I rectors of the YMCA, the Men’s

Council, the ‘National Council
of Christians and Jews.

The Newman Club in its ap-
peal to the intellectual, sincere
members of the University stu:
dent body neither did, nor does
now, seek to have a controversy
over religious standards of mor-
ality; but rather that those ob-
jective standards -of decency, ac-
cepted by all sound-thinking
people; be followed in any pub-
lication that would represent it-
self as a student publication.

The Panther has given any-
thing but a true presentation of
college level humor. College level
is certainly above the gutter. The
Cathedral of Learningstill points
up-ward as asymbol of the stu-
dents yearning for “higher- edu-
cation.” ',,._

‘Pitt Newmanites together with
other Pitt-minded and Pitt—in-
terested ‘students feel that any-
thing bearing the Pitt name or

Denies Degeneracy Charge

Editor,
The Pitt News,

, Since only a handful of students has expressed its views I
on True Concessions, it is impossible to determine the true
overall campus reaction. We do know, however, that cer-
tain groups were offended, and—if_the frequency of missivesy
to the News is any standard——gravely offended. ..

To those persons, and to those
who maintained a charitable
silence, we can only offer apol-

ogies for a poor issue. This we
the spirited aproval registered by ‘

have never been hesitant to do.
The matter, however, has
grown, to proportions ‘beyond
those of bad writing and edit-
ing. Now, it is swelled by. charges
of vulgarity, immortality, and

repulsiVeness——charges that have A

been extended to include the en-
tire year’s output. .

We have never (and didn’t in
True Concessions) purposely ‘at-
tempted to be offensive. There

I now quote a statement from

the shallowness of your words:

makes the difference-
and Luckies taste better!

The difference between “just smoking” and

cigarette.; You can taste the difference in the
smoother, mellower, more enjoyable taste of a ‘
Lucky . . . for two important reasons. First,
L.S./M.F.T.-—Lucky Strike means ﬁne tobacco
. . . ﬁne, mild tobacccrthat tastes better. Second,
Luckies are made to taste better : . . proved best-

Chilean Coed Makes Kappa

House Resemble Hacienda

By TERESA KANE

The Kappa Kappa Gamma
house almost resembles a Span-
ish hacienda since Tegualda Gen-
tile Mundaca Ouiriz arrived.

Tegualda, a registered nurse,
from Conception, Chile is studying
advanced courses in nursing and
psychiatry so she will be quali-

I Vﬁed for the position of Superin-

tendent of Nursing at La Escuela
Enferma, when sire returns home.
Miss Mundaca arrived in the
United States , during the early
part of. last July. After studying
at the ‘University of Michigan
during the summer session, she
came to Pitt inseptember.
Likes United States
“Me gusta muchisimo los estados
unidos” is Tegualda’s way of say-
ing that she likes our United
States. She marvels at our cus-
toms, and likes our climate bet-
ter than that of Chile. She insists
however that the men of Chile are
far more gallant than ours.
‘ Tequalda ﬁnds it hard to under-
stand the manner in which the
average teen-age student studies.

She doesn’t see how anyone can
learn anything with noise, confu-
sion and a plate of food.
Naturally Tegua, as‘ she is some-
times called, is lonesome for her
home, but with so many things to
see and places to go, she ﬁnds no
time for being homesick, except
when she thinks of Juanito. Jua-
nito is Tequa’s “novio,” which
means sweetheart in Spanish.
Won Many Friends
Tegua’s bubbling personality has
won her many friends. She is
learning English rapidly and likes
to practice new words on her
friends, but she leaves a little

Spanish atmosphere as a souvenir
where ever she goes.
