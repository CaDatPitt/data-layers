Celebration

Malcolm X tribte stresses unity, identity

By Gregory Wieclaw, Jr.
For The Pitt News

Before he was
for African Americans.

Decades later, this same View was
expressed by speakers, poets and

performers at the fourth annual 
Malcolm X Holiday -
Celebration held Saturday afternoon ‘

National

in David Lawrence Hall, attended by
approximately 800 people.

“The people who settled in America
were looking for goods, spices and
silks. The people who came from
Africa didn’t come as people. They
came as goods — products with mar-
ket value,” award-winning playwright
August Wilson told the audience.
“The world the Africans found them-
selves in was not of their making.”

Wilson said African norms and cul-
ture were destroyed by North
Americans who used slave labor,‘bod—
ies and resources to finance the
industrial revolution. “What’s the
difference between the Ku Klux Klan
and George Washington?” asked Lee

Kiburi, chair of the Malcolm X

Holiday Commission. “When you had
slavery, you didn’t need the Ku Klux
Klan  George Washington-was the
Ku Klux Klan.”

According to Kiburi, traditional holidays such as
Independence Day and Thanksgiving are hypocritical. He
said only white independence is celebrated, and ques-
tioned whether an Indian could be found with whom to

assassinated, é
Malcolm X said the American system ‘
was incapable of producing freedom .

Sun’s rays more harmful than many realize

By Dave Titmus
For The Pitt News

All those hours spent in the sun
achieving the perfect tan may be doing
more harm to your body than you
know.

Skin cancer affects 632,000 people
and causes 8,800 deaths in the United
States each year, according to Pitt pro-
fessor of dermatology Dr. Arthur
Rhodes.

Skin cancer, a disease caused by pro-
longed exposure to the sun’s rays, is
characterized by a mole or freckle that
has changed in color or shape. “A lesion
that has recently changed should be
looked at as soon as possible,” regis-
tered nurse at the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center’s Falk Clinic
Linda Nicholes said.

Rhodes said that skin cancer actually
consists of different diseases. One such
disease, melanoma, usually appears in

the upper back and chest areas as black
or brown lesions. “The risk of develop-
ing melanoma over a lifetime is about
one percent for whites and about one-
twelfth as common in non—whites,” he
said.

Melanoma is regarded as the most
dangerous form of skin cancer, accord-
ing to Dr. Rhodes.

“About 99 percent of people who
have melanoma detected and treated in

UPMC aids
President ’s
Health Care
Task Force

By Frank Porco
Asst. News Editor

University of Pittsburgh Medical Center
administrators have compiled a list of rec-
ommendations concerning the future of
academic medical centers as a possible
asset to the President’s health care reform
package.

“We are proposing making an academic
medical center the cornerstone of a new
American health-care system,” director of
Pitt’s Health Sciences Bureau Jane
Duffield said. “These centers would play a
pivotal role in assuring that health care is
provided at a reasonable cost to all peo-
ple.”

According to Duffield, the proposal pre-
pared by UPMC administrators offers sug-
gestions for making academic medical
centers the core of the health-care system
by expanding on President Clinton’s ideas
for improved health care in America.
During his campaign, Clinton called for
easier access to health care and the cre-
ation of a National Health Board to define
a basic benefit package that would be
available to all Americans.

The UPMC proposal endorses Clinton’s
plans but suggests that academic medical
centers should play a large role in
determing how health benefits are deliv-
ered, Duffield said.

“We’re calling for a final reimbursement
of academic medical centers for costs
related to the development of new treat-
ments and facilities,” Duffield’ said.

The President’s Health Care Task Force
is studying an approach that would man-
date health networks to offer benefits at
the lowest possible cost.

Duffield said she believes that the med-
ical centers should anchor these net-
works.

The medical centers would play a key
role in providing quality health care at a
reasonable cost, Duffield said.

The proposal also calls for the develop-
ment of a funding source for medical edu-
cation supported by contributions from
health-care insurance companies.

Other recommendations addressed
medical malpractice reform and funding
for research.

New director of Public Safety to be chosen by August

Byjulie Sabol and

Andrea Barczykowski
The Pitt News

A new director of public safe-
ty should be in place by August
1, according to Assistant Vice
Chancellor for Business John
DeVitto.

“The person may not be phys-
ically here, but we should have
a name,” he said. “Although my
concern is quality, not speed, I
would think once the commit-

tee starts to meet [a director
should be chosen] by the first of
August.”

The position opened after
William Brennan’s sudden resig-
nation in March left Walt
Waters to finish the year as
interim director of public safety.

Meeting for the first time yes-
terday, a 10-member search
committee began evaluating the
director’s job description and
reviewing the process for adver-
tising the position, according to

search committee Chair Jim
Watters.

Although the committee has
not made any decisions regard-
ing what they are looking for in
a candidate, student member
Jacob Brody said it is important
that the person has a clear
understanding of the safety
needs of an urban university.

“The person is going to need
to put more stress on communi-
ty involvement from our cam-
pus police, not just students, but

Oakland residents and business-
es,” Brody said.

The committee will conduct a
nationwide search, sending
advertisements for the position
to police departments and col-
leges and universities through-
out the country. To further
accomodate the search, they
will also advertise in appropri-
ate public sources such as pro-
fessional journals, newspapers
and magazines. Each committee
member has also been asked to

identify people they know in
order to begin networking to
find a qualified applicant,
according to Watters.

William Savage, director of
affirmative action, informed the
committee of the university’s
policies and procedures regard-
ing equal opportunity and affir-
mative action. According to
DeVitto, the Office of
Affirmative Action must
approve the advertisements
before they are distributed.

LS C helps improve grades CORRECTION

GPSA censored by Pitt

By Lynn Belice
For The Pitt News

During the summer many stu-
dents have more free time -
time for swimming, picnicking,
bicycling, improving study skills
and boosting their grade-point
average.

Those last two activities might
not be on everybody’s agenda,
but are recommended by Linda
Hooper, learning specialist at the
Leaming Skills Center.

The title “Study Skills
Workshop” may sound intimidat-
ing, but this could be one of the
most useful things students could
do for themselves, according to
Hooper. '

“This workshop is not only for
students with learning problems,
but also for students who are
simply concerned about doing
better in their classes,” Hooper
saidflhis program also helps stu-
dents to better their grades by
showing new ways to enhance
their study skills, she said.The
Learning Skills Center has set

these workshops up in the sum-
mer for those students who have
the extra time now, rather than
cramming it into their fall and
spring schedules.

“We try to fit students with
helpers that are in the same ﬁeld
as they are, which always bene-
fits the student,” Hooper said.
The sessions are smaller in the
summer, which allows for more
personal contact.

According to Hooper, there are
also personal appointments
which are available for one-on-
one counseling.The Learning
Skills Center is available for tutor-
ing and speed-reading classes
also, which most students do not
realize. “The center does more
than a thousand hours of math
tutoring a week,” Hooper said.

One fifth—year student said, “I
wish I would have discovered
the Learning Skills Center four
years ago. I’d be out [of college]
by now.”

For more information call the
Learning Skills Center at 648-

officials, Parks says

ByChrissy Koch

Staff Writer

Graduate and Professional Student Association President
Steve Parks accused the university administration of censoring
the graduate organization during a meeting last night. Parks
said the university overruled GPSA’s decision to increase its
activities fee because GPSA refused to pay a security fee pro-
posed by the university.

“They censored us. We voted on their fee, and they censored
us because we were against an undemocratic fee the students
had no say in. Because in effect, they won’t let us have a fee we
democratically voted on. We tried to stir up controversy about
undemocratic fees, and they basically shut us down for the next
year,” Parks said.

Last term the GPSA voted to increase the activities fee for the
upcoming year. According to Parks, the group needs the
money to keep running at the same level as the other student
goverrmients, such as the Student Government Board, which
receives nearly 10 times the funding. -

Although GPSA voted by a majority to raise graduate student
activities fees, the administration turned down the increase
because all fee increases have been frozen. The administration
doesn’t want them to be seen as tuition increases, said Parks.
Although Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor has prohibited the
increase, GSPA members will still go through other administra-
tive boards for help, Parks said.

“We made what was an internal decision with the graduate
students and then [the administration] munched it,” M. Serena
Spencer, representative of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences,
said. With its present budget, GPSA cannot afford any full-time
employees to run its office, said Parks. He also said that the

Researchers evaluate
responses to alcohol

By Michael Lyczko
For the Pitt News

Fruit drinks are helping Pitt medical researchers to evaluate
how drinking alcohol relates to a person’s mood and perfor-
mance.

“We really don’t know a lot about individual responses to
alcohol,” principal investigator Dr. Chris Martin said. The
study is looking into why alcohol affects some individuals
more than others.

Researchers are studying three variables: gender, current
drinking practices and family history. Two groups are of par-
ticular interest: those whose fathers have or have had alcohol
problems, and those whose first or second-degree relatives
have no history of alcohol problems.

Subjects are given fruit drinks which may or may not con-

tain alcohol during five to seven hour sessions over four con-
secutive days. Performance is measured by a “challenging,
driving—simulation task where numbers appear on thre.e dif-
ferent screens and subjects press buttons depending on
which number appears. Complex tasks such as this are more
sensitive to the effects of alcohol,” Martin said.
'ore any drinking, subjects can practice the driving simu-
1 tion t sk so that they can attain a steady level of perfor-
e.Ma1tin stressed that those with alcohol problems are
not eligible for the study. He said women will be tested to
ensure that they are not pregnant and transportation will be
provided.

Sessions start in the late afternoon. Subjects are tested indi-
vidually, “in a relaxed, sitting position. We also try our best to
control variables," Martin said. Body weight and body—fat
content will be adjusted for the study.

Abstinence from alcohol and other drugs outside the ses-
sion during the study period is required, while caffeine is
prohibited within four hours of a session’s start.

Subjects are questioned about their views toward alcohol,
and about family history of drug and alcohol use. A subject’s
mood is assessed before and after drinking. Intoxication lev-
els are also monitored, according to Martin.

Subjects are encouraged to be honest in their performance.
Martin said confidentiality helps to encourage this. Bonus
payments are made if people do well, so people are encour-
aged to do their best. There is no deception in the study. But
to keep results unbiased, some information isn’t provided
until the sessions are completed, according to Martin. When
their participation is over, subjects are given a lot of informa-
tion about the effects of alcohol, “to make it an informative
and interesting experience,” Martin said.

“lThe study] is designed to improve and expand upon
other research in .the field. We hope to be able to identify
populations at high risk for future alcohol problems so that
they can be targeted for prevention efforts,” Martin said.

Healthy men and women, ages 21 to 28, who have at least
three drinks twice a month are eligible to take an initial
screening test.. Subjects cannot be adopted children. Further
information can be obtained by calling 624-1696.

an early phase of development

cal rernoval,” he said.

Other forms of skin cancer,
basal cell and squamous cell
cancer, are most often associat-
ed with overexposure to the
sun. Basal-cell cancer usually
occurs in light-skinned people
who sunburn easily, but do not
tan. It appears as a small ﬂeshy
lump.

Squamous-cell cancer also
occurs in light-skinned people
but appears as a red scaly patch.
“Sun protection during the first
15 years of life has been esti-
mated to reduce non-melanoma
skin cancer risk by 85 percent,”
Rhodes said.

People with blond or red hair
and blue or green eyes run the
greatest risk for basal—cell or
squamous-cell cancers,
although skin cancer can also
effect dark-skinned people,
according to Rhodes.

“Identification of the cancer is
the first step in treatment,”
Nicholes said. “Catching it early
greatly improves the chances of
curing the cancer.”

Rhodes said that precaution-
ary measures should be taken
against sun exposure.

“Sensible sun exposure
means avoiding getting red in
the sun, avoiding sun exposure
during peak intensity, between
10 a.m. and 2 p.m., from early
spring to late fall and using sun-
screens to protect skin not easi-
ly covered by clothing,” he said.

The Department of
Dermatology at the Falk Clinic
provides skin cancer screenings

Murder is a crime
On Sunday, a Louisiana jury acquitted Rodney Peairs of
manslaughter charges for the murder of Yoshihiro
Hattori, a Japanese exchange student. The 16-year old
was shot at point blank range last October 17th in Baton
Rouge. The boy thought he was going to a Halloween
party when he mistakenly approached Peairs’ house.
Peairs’ wife answered the door, saw Hattori dressed as
John Travolta and told her husband to get his gun.

Claiming that Hattori was brandishing a weapon,
Peairs shot and killed him.

According to The New York Times, Peairs had many
sympathizers in his Louisiana town. One man said, “It
would be to me what a normal person would do under
those circumstances.” It seems that what his sympathiz-
ers believe to be normal behavior is to kill a young boy
who had no more of a weapon than the camera he was
holding. The pattern follows that it’s normal to be afraid
of crime, it’s normal to suspect harmful intent and it’s
normal to be paranoid. But to Hattori and to his father
sitting in the courtroom listening to the jury’s acquittal,
paranoia is no excuse for murder.

As part of his defense Peairs’ lawyer said, “[I]n your
house, if you want to do it you have the legal right to
answer everybody who comes to your door with a gun,”
according to the Times. The legality of this is not in
question. But this legal right has somehow been trans—
lated into a legal right to also use the gun on everyone
who comes to the door.

The more people believe guns are necessary, the more
people live in fear of having to use them. .

According to the Times, Peairs’ sympathizer also said,
“we are just prisoners in our own neighborhoods.” Even
though a young boy is dead, and a family is left to
mourn him, Peairs’ supporters still believe that they are
the victims.

Our society with all its violent crimes has produced
people who live in constant fear. People are calling this
fear a prison, but Hattori had no part in creating that
fear. Peairs should not use this paranoia to avoid
responsibility for a murder he committed.

When Peairs’ wife summoned her husband to get the
gun, Peairs had no verbal response. Peairs’ wife said,
“there was no thinking involved.” After the doorbell
rang, there was time for Peairs’ wife to call him. There
was also time for Peairs to get his gun. But there was no
time to thinkabout the fact that during this time Hattori
was making no attempt to break into his home.

Peairs did not think about his actions when he killed
the boy, yet the jury did not find him responsible for his
actions.

Paranoia is not an excuse to kill an innocent person
who comes to the door. A young man is dead because
another man didn’t think before he acted.

That is a crime.

New worldy attitudes needed

We live in rapidly changing times. The entire
span of the 20th century has been a kaleido-
scope of unprecedented technological advance
and social change.

The focus of international affairs has moved
away from the portrayal of regional conflicts as
removed from our daily American lives to
national concern and involvement in the out-
comes of those disputes. Nationally and inter-
nationally we are more col-

immediate victims. A world citizen sees that
history isvnot fragmented but an interconnected
whole and that each of us is a creator of histo-
ry, not a bystander. From where humanity
stands now in its history, world citizenship
demands that we expand our narrow social and
political allegiances to include concern for the
interests of the world as a whole, to “Let your
vision be world embracing, rather than con-
fined to your own self.”

lectively conscious of the
environment. Our economy
is no longer insulated but
strongly linked to interna-
tional inﬂuence. As we move
toward the 21st century, the
world is becoming a neigh-
borhood, and our interdependence is becom-
ing increasingly evident through this painful
social process of breakdown and reordering.

It is easy to feel lost and helpless in this vor-
tex of events that is surging around us. World
events often seem too big, too “out there” for
us to feel that we can effect positive change or
to be motivated enough to even find out what
is happening. But we are affected. We feel an
emotional reaction to the stories of famine and
rape camps in former Yugoslavia.

Closer to home, the very real social problems
of unemployment, poverty, violence, inefficient
government and our own personal struggles
have overwhelmed our youthful sense of ideal-
ism.

Materialism rules and social unity is deemed
a vain utopian dream. If we look more closely
at all that is occurring around us, the most
pressing challenge facing our generation over
the next decade is not necessarily to graduate
successfully or pin down a desirable job.
Although these activities are integral to our
lives, the more fundamental question that we,
as the politicians, teachers, scientists, mothers
and fathers who will take us into the 21st cen-
tury, must ask is: do we tolerate or innovate?
Do we resign ourselves to social destruction,
skepticism and mediocrity, or do we resolve to
build a more positive collective future with
each of us as active participants? As we make
the transition to the 21st century, can we see
ourselves as world citizens?

To be a world citizen involves understanding
that each of us is a unique contributor to the
quality of our future, even if we remain name-
less in the written histories to come. We need
to have a conception of history as something
deeper than a series of events occurring at an
isolated point in time and having repercussions
for those only directly involved.

The tragic effects of the Holocaust and slav-
ery in the United States reach far beyond their

‘tolerance and create a world order based ‘on?

We can claim world
citizenry by regarding ethnici-
ty, religious affiliation, race,
sex, income, class, education
level, nationality and other
dispositions as unique expres-
sions of our individual human-
ness rather than as cause for division and strife.
The goal of world citizenship is to go beyond?

l

  

unity in diversity. The challenge is to see our-l
selves as members of one global family with*
varied interests and aptitudes, to free ourselves"
from the limited identities of the past and to
actively plug ourselves into the global pulse.

Consciousness of world citizenship begins
with personal transformation; personal transfor-
mation is the catalyst for lasting social change.
It requires both a centering of thought and
action on the pressing needs of humanity,
which includes, of course, ourselves.

Individually, we can begin by recapturing the
sacred or divine that is within ourselves and by
acknowledging that human nature is funda-
mentally spiritual. We can then readily
acknowledge the essential oneness of all
human beings, the intimate link binding us one
to another at a very fundamental level.

As we tap into our innate spiritual and moral
powers and become more centered in that spir-
ituality, the walls of our prejudices will crum-
ble.

This refocusing of our perception of our-
selves will manifest itself in the quality of our
interpersonal relationships, family lives, busi-
ness relations and career choices, and ultimate-
ly in the politics that govern the affairs of the
world at large.

Once we have eliminated the outdated
assumptions of the past that have been the
basis of much of our politics and social rela-
tions that have resulted in war and confusion,
we can emerge into the 21st century with a
refreshed vigor and see with perfect clarity our
place in the collective interest of the human
race. _

The world is becoming a neighborhood, and
we are its citizens.

It is well known that the Blade race is

not lenow, is that after 65 years of so-
called emancipation, American Negroes

al sufferings, of which the most cruel
and horrible is the custom of lynching.
— Ho Chi Minh, 1924

Lecturer and professor Dr. Francis
Cress-Welsing contends that the
Caucasoid is genetically inferior to per-
sons of color. Cress-Welsing goes further
to assert her “theory of color confronta-

tion.” Based upon this theory, Cress-

Welsing believes that since Caucasoids
are descendents of Africans, they must
be “genetically recessive,” viewing their
inability to produce melanin, or color.

But it has never been a secret that the
Caucasoid is the albino of the African
race. Cress-Welsing’s theory views the
“genetic recessiveness” of the Caucasoid
as one of the primary causes of
Caucasian violence against people of
color, and cites their history as evidence
of her beliefs.

Cress-Welsing asserts that Caucasoids
have historically de-humanized people
of color based solely on their own racial
attitudes. Thus, it is common throughout
our history to cite cases of “genetic anni-
hilation” based on the frustrations of the
“genetically recessive” Caucasoid.

A particular case of interest is the
“FREEZE CASE,” in which a Caucasoid
intentionally shot and killed a young,
vibrant Japanese student after he mistak-
enly arrived at the assailant’s home for

what he thought was a Halloween party.
The Caucasoid shot the foreign student
at point-blank range because of a “fear”
that the Japanese student was a burglar
who previously robbed the assailant’s
vehicle. B

color confrontation,”

African-Americans must umte against exploztatzons

The time has arrived for the first peo-
ple, or people of color, to realize that
ever since the arrival of the Caucasoid
on their lands, they were always identi-
ﬁed as targets to be enslaved, exploited
or killed, in order to maintain the sur-
vival of the “genetic
recessive” Caucasoid.

As the world
becomes increasingly
comprised of non-
European descen-

have been de-human-
ized within this white,
supremacist U.S. sys-
tem.

According to the
Caucasoid, the African
has always been an
object of fear, resent-
ment, or envy, both physically and non-
physically.

Physically, Cress-Welsing points out
that the African male may reproduce his
own kind due to his “genetic superiori-
ty.” This is not a fact easily accepted by
the Caucasoid, the most recently devel-
oped human being, who has always
been fighting for genetic survivalsince
his days of barbarism in the caves of the
Caucas Mountains. '

Henceforth, the African Holocaust of
Enslavement, which was enacted by the
“genetically recessive” Caucasoid,
should no longer be interpreted with
confusion.

Neither should the fact that Caucasians
have ﬂooded black communities with
crack and heroine alarm the victims of
white violence.

dents, it is imperative
that we people of
color form strategic
alliances to combat
and/or counteract
the gross injustices
placed upon us by
the system estab-
lished by the Caucasoid.

Logically, people of color must begin V

to unite mentally for the continued war
against “white supremacy/domination.”
The task may seem enormous, yet El Hajj
Malik Shabazz once stated, “Korea won
the war against the white man with just a
bowl of rice, sneakers and a gun.”

First, we being people who possess
the ability to produce “MELANIN,” must
begin a dialogue, confronting the global
injustices and ignorances perpetrated on
a global scale by Caucasian confusion,
fear and insecurity. Secondly, Africans,
Asians, Latinos/Hispanics and other eth-
nicities of color must begin to economi-
cally support each other.

Over the past several years, African-

Americans have economically supported V

Asian businesses, as ‘well as sanctioned

them as valuable establishments within
our communities. Yet, a fundamental
fact remains —-— namely, the unequal cal-
iber of support that has been given to
Africana businesses by Asians. Thirdly,
people of color must begin to exploit the
international resources available (i.e. the
United Nations) to convict Caucasoids of
their global, inhuman acts. Issues such
as the aforementioned must be
addressed in order to further progress in
the liberation of people of color across
the globe.

It must be understood that it is not the
actor (Caucasoid) in the system that
frames the decisions.

But more precisely, it is the system
that often frames any given decision, and
we as a people of color must begin to
eradicate this structure/system of confu-
sion and injustice.

Through an African-centered perspec-
tive, the members of the first world (or

peoples of color) have much to gain by _

forming a union and attacking the cor-
rupt and brutal system of government
imposed by the African albino.

The African has suffered all of the
Caucasian forms of barbarism and the
rest of the first world can surely share
their remembrances of the same experi-
ences.

It must be asked of the first world:
how long will they tolerate Caucasian
deception and fraud, and how much
longer will they wait to tear down these
walls of modem-day Babylon?

Wonder.Woman, canvas Ni’/ees remembered fondly

I think it’s about time to lighten things
up a bit. I’ve been worried about
add/drop, finding a new apartment and
finding a summer job. All those so-called
“adult” problems.

Sometimes I think it helps if I stop and
remember the ‘70s.

I remember that instead of agonizing
over whether or not I should buy a car or
a motorcycle, I was torn between the two
pairs of canvas Nikes I saw on the store
shelf. One pair had a blue swoosh and the
other a brilliant red. And at $25 a pair, my
mother warned that it would be one or
the other. Fifty dollars, she would say,
would put us in the poor house. I picked
back my Afro and tried to stay calm. What
to do? I thought.

Hmmm, I said to myself as I fidgeted
with the butterﬂy collar on my plaid shirt.
I liked the red ones because they stood
out more. But the blue ones were the
same color as my new designer jeans:

‘Sergio Valente. I decided on the blue pair

and we rode home listening to my Mom’s
favorite song on the Gremlin’s eight track.
The wailing Bee Gees made-me wanna
throw up.

I couldn’t wait for the house party that
night. My friend Marvin, who had the
annoying habit of being the fastest kid to
the ice-cream man (Mr. Softee), promised
everybody that he had the latest disco
hits: Brick House, We've Got the Funk,
Funky Town and Car Wash. But the party
didn’t start for another three or four hours.

I remember trying to find something to
do. My Tonka dump truck was all rusted
out and the wheels to most of my Hot
Wheels collection were melted. from
repeated explosions by firecrackers and
cherry bombs.

The lightening bugs I had caught
months earlier were begging on their
backs in the jar. I went into my sister’s
room only to discover that my favorite
hauling vehicle — her big, yellow Barbie
motor home — was too junky for me to
use.

This left only one more option: watch-
ing the new color television my mom had
recently bought. . 0

To my dismay, my sister was already
watching it. “Don’t even think about it,”
she growled as I stood, tempted to click
the huge knob to something else. It

wouldn’t have mattered anyway. Nothing
I wanted to watch was on Saturdays any-

way. “The Six Million-Dollar Man,” “Good

Times” and “Wonder Woman (with that
strapless top I sometimes prayed would
fall down)” — those shows were for the
weekdays.

My sister was into stuff like Grease, “The
Brady Bunch” and John Travolta in
Saturday Night Fever. Even though it
wasn’t my thing,

I had to give her credit. She had gone to
see Carrie when it first came out. Not me.
I didn’t even go see jaws. That shark
wasn’t using my 70-pound frame to pick
his teeth with.

The doorbell rang. It was my friend
Britton from down the street. He was ‘on
his bike, not a care in the world. He had
tennis balls in his spokes, streamers on
the handle bars and a gold-sparkled
banana seat adorned his ride.

He was a no-joking kind of kid. So
much, in fact, that he was inviting me to
see The Hills Have Eyes at the local drive-
in.

“No way, man!” I told him, just thinking
about the trailers I had seen on television.
“I’m going to watch the ‘Hardy Boys and
Nancy Drew’ tonight.” “Okay,” he said
looking at his new Superman watch. “See
you at the party.”

He pedaled away in his gray suede

 

Pumas and Jordache jeans. Some people, I
thought, had it all.

I remember thinking that my mother
and sister had it all because they could
multiply and divide,

My sister, who was still glued to the
television, asked my mother how much
money she would be getting for her
upcoming birthday. She said, “I think
about nine times three.” I was immediate-
ly frustrated.

I’ll admit multiplication and division had
me stumped.I could never get it straight
which one joined parts and which one
separated parts. I took a hopeful guess
that she meant joining three groups of
nines. But wait. Was I actually adding
now? I thought this was multiplication. I

couldn’t be sure, but I went ahead and .

counted nine three times on my two
hands.

Suddenly, I saw the importance of
learning my times tables by heart. I think I
counted 30 one time, 28 another, and
even 26. But I got 27 for most of them, so
I figured that to be it. All that figuring took
most of the night. The clock on the wall
had the little hand on the nine and the big
hand also.

I knew that to be 9:45, but adults called
it “quarter ‘till”. Fifteen minutes ‘till I
could show off my brand-new canvas
Nikes.

My Mom asked me if I wanted her to
starch and iron my only pair of designer
jeans.

Funny how things look when you’re in
the thick of things — all serious, a bit
scary, sort of stressful.

‘But give it some time and soon you’ll
have these warm and funny memories
too.

Hopefully, those overdue bills shouting
“SEND YOUR PAYMENT NOW!” will just
be a part of those warm, funny college
memories — who knows — maybe ten
years from now.

SLIVER

Hollywood
takes stab at
Peeping Toms

By Bill Kirchner

Entertainment Editor

Sliver

Directed by Phillip Noyce

Written by joe Eszterhas

based on the novel by Ira Levin
Produced by Robert Evans

Starring Sharon Stone, Wiliam Baldwin
and Tom Berenger

Advertised with the catch phrase, “you
like to watch don’t you” and starring that
diva of the basic psychosexual instinct,
Sharon Stone, it’s difficult to miss the
point. Sliver is about voyeurism. What
William Baldwin’s character is privy to,
we also want to be. Like Sharon Stone’s
Carly Norris we’re fascinated by things
we are not supposed to see. Sounds
interesting. Too bad Phillip Noyce’s
Sliver is nothing but a pretender on the
subject.

Voyeurism has been part of the thriller
since film noir’s “preying camera” had us
peering around doorways and through
windows. Hitchcock made it a consistent
theme ——- Rear Window might be the
most obvious example. In the 1960s
British director Michael Powell gave us
his classic Peeping Tom. V

Film itself is a voyeuristic medium.
Pardon the lecture, but after watching
Sliverl wonder whether director Phillip
Noyce or screenwriter/producer Joe
Eszterhas (Basic Instinct) had any of this
in mind. At least it doesn’t show up on
screen.

The opening scene of the murder of a
woman is filmed through the grainy
black and white of a surveillance—camera
monitor. Director Phillip Noyce goes on
to focus those images from the point of
view of someone watching a bank of
surveillance monitors with their seem-
ingly endless perspective on the resi-
dents of the particular New York high
rise which is the film’s setting. Their
bathrooms, bedrooms, sex lives and
arguments are put on display. The audi-
ence is immediately a voyeur in its own

right.

Carly Norris (Sharon Stone) and Zeke Hawkins (William Baldwin) in Sliver.

Noyce uses the images from these
monitors as a dramatic device through-
out the film, the black—and-white,
voyeuristic images reaching a point of
kinetic overload through some slick
high—speed editing, their increased inten-
sity designed to parallel the rising sus-
pense as the whodunnit takes its twists
and turns.

Too bad Eszterhas’ script never man-
ages to maintain that parallel. The narra-
tive really lacks any sustained suspense,
so points of climax fall flat. Often,
Noyce’s attempt to whip up a visual hys-
teria with the black-and-white images
turns silly as a result. When Stone’s char-
acter gets to see just what Zeke Hawkins
(William Baldwin) has been watching,
one has got to laugh at her mid—orgasmic
look, complete with glazed eyes and
disheveled hair as she switches from one
camera to another, remote control in
hand. She doesn’t just like to watch —
one taste and now she has to watch. See
what I mean’ '

It’s probably elitist to ask a film to deal
with the subject of voyeurism on some
kind of intellectual level. Sliver certainly
does not. But it also falls short of its
claim of telling a story about voyeurism
on any level approaching the original.
Since Hitchcock the thriller has depend-

ed on a tight narrative and a closely par-
allel, visual sense. It’s the potential real-
ism of the events on screen which make
them scary.

This notion seems lost in Sliver. It lacks
the psychosexual suspense of a film like
Louis Ma1le’s Damage or Brian
DePalma’s tale of peeping-tom intrigue
Body Double and seems to suffer the
same problems of Eszterhas’ last effort
Basic Instinct.

This is gonna sound ridiculous, but
both Noyce and Eszterhas ought to
watch some Hitchcock. You’d think they
might have but you’d never know it by
watching Sliver. That sounds very
refreshing at first, remembering how
annoying it was to watch second—rate
Hitchcock in a film like Dead Again. But

if Sliver had that much sense it’d be a ’

step up.

It’s a bit ironic that a film advertised as
a voyeur’s delight is less than shocking.
Again, Eszterhas’ weak script looks like
the culprit. In the midst of a thriller he
throws in a subplot about a girl living in

the building who is sexually abused by‘

her father. Baldwin’s character eventual-
ly uses it as an offering to Stone and tries

to do “good things” with his knowledge V

of the situation by scaring the father with
a telephone call. D

But it’s all done to impress on Stone’s
character that he’s a nice guy, while the
film has been painting him into a tighter
and tighter corner as a borderline per-
vert. Which is he? What about this girl?
It’s just an awful distraction in the film.

It’s no secret that the thriller has taken
over the role of the horror film in recent
years.

Looking at a film like Sliverl wonder if
the thriller will not suffer the same fate.
Will an endless array of sequels, imita-
tions and just poorly-told stories turn the
whole genre upside down as it becomes
a self—parody?

It seems that Hollywood would find an
injection of realism into the genre to its
benefit. Keep it scary. The thrill in a
thriller is that it could be real, that on
screen it is real. Why bite the hand that
feeds you? If Sliver is any indicator
though, it looks like they’ll beat it into
the ground.

Maybe we’ll see a resurrection of the
Western. Let’s not forget about
Eastwood’s Unforgiven. But I don’t like
the thought of Clint ridin’ on a horse,
shootin’ people on screen when he’s
seventy. Especially for ten bucks a seat.

Sliver should sticle around for a decent
run. Locally it’s showing at the Squirrel
Hill Theatre. Call 421- 7900 for times.

When Railroad Jerk plays the blues, the band
approaches it with all the finesse of a sledgehammer.
In fact, it takes said sledgehammer to aforementioned
blues, breaks the music into little, bitty pieces and
glues it back together the way it wants. The final
result sounds appropriately mangled and demented,
as one might expect from a Lower East Side New
York City band — only better.

It might not sound like traditional blues, but every
so often little, signs of the blues slip through the
cracks, serving as reference points for Railroad ]erk’s
music.

Matador Records released the band’s self-titled
debut in 1990. The record shows the band building its
sound around pounding drums and riffs that often
emphasize weird beats. Broken-sounding slide gui-
tars found their way into the band’s sound. A compar-

RAILROAD JERK

NY’s blues/ noise combo

ison could be made between the band and fellow 10-
fi rockers Pussy Galore, but Railroad Jerk seems to
possess more of an imagination and diversity from
song to song.

“I’m Not Mad,” for instance, starts out with acoustic
guitar and weezing harmonica, almost like saloon
music. But after a few moments, the whole band
attacks with a heavy stop-start rhythm.

The song, which closes the album, ends with more
acoustic guitar, interrupted by blasts of radio static.
Like the song, the band contains different elements
of both music and noise, struggling to be heard.

After its debut album, a single and a tour that
brought the band to town in 1991, Railroad Jerk lost

band members somewhere along the way. Its most
recent release, Raise The Plow, left bassist Tony Lee
and guitarist Marcellus Hall as the only holdovers
from the last recordings.

Former Drunk Tank member Steve Cerio joined the
band to whack the tubs. Members of both Jonestown
and Uncle Wiggly sat in as auxiliary guitarists on the
record. When the quartet returns to Pittsburgh this
week, Alex Stephen will fill out the band as its new
guitarist. '

In a day when too many hacks try to play the blues
— and fail —— it’s refreshing to hear a band hack up
the blues and create something significant in the
process. Go to the Bloomfield Bridge Tavern on
Thursday to experience it.

Appearing with Railroad Jerk will he Human

Investigation also
reveals rec m i ti ng
infraction by

men ’s bas/eeball

By Brian Gallagher
Sports Editor

An NCAA investigation of Pitt’s athlet-
ic department has revealed 16 rules vio-
lations by the University’s football and
men’s basketball programs.

According to an official inquiry by the
National Collegiate Athletic Assoctiation
received by the chancellors’ office last
week, the Pitt football program commit-
ted 15 rules infractions under the aus-
pice of former head coach Mike
Gottfried and former athletic director Ed
Bozik. The NCAA also found the basket-
ball program guilty of a single recruiting
violation, which occurred in 1988-89,
under current head coach Paul Evans.

The investigation, which began in
May 1992, is related to the results of the
university’s self-investigation on the
football program which was submitted
to the NCAA on May 11, 1992, following
Pitt’s internal inquiry into allegations of
rules infractions. In that inquiry, the uni-
versity confessed to 11 rules infractions
and nine possible violations in the foot-
ball program.‘

Pitt News hie Photo

The NCAA points the ﬁnger at the Mike (iotfried [above] era of Pitt football.

According to Pitt Director of Athletics
Oval Jaynes, the NCAA inquiry yielded
the same findings as the university’s
investigation.

“All 13 violations we reported [in May
1992] were included in the 15 violations
announced by the NCAA,” Jaynes said.
“There were also two of nine possible
violations confirmed by the enforcement
committee as legitimate violations.”

Included in the 15 football infractions:
providing players with clothing, money
and meals and giving prospective
recruits limousine rides and luxury hotel

suites.

While Jaynes anticipated a laundry list
of violations regarding the football pro-
gram, he did not expect the defined
basketball impropriety — though he
knew of the specific situation. .

“We were aware of the fact that they
were looking at a situation that devel-
oped in 1988-89 — a possible recruiting
violation,” Jaynes said “It was a little bit
of a shock, but I can’t comment on the
specifics because I wasn’t here at the
time.”

The recruiting violation, believed to

have involved recruit Jamal Faulkner,
involved a former assistant coach.
Faulkner never attended Pitt, opting for
Cheshire (Conn.) Academy and eventu-
ally Arizona State University.

Pitt head basketball coach Paul Evans
could not be reached for comment.

The next move in the investigation
belongs to Pitt, which must adhere to
several unidentified requests for addi-
tional information by the NCAA inquiry.

Beyond the university’s response,
which Jaynes expects to take “four-to-
six weeks”, the NCAA will schedule Pitt
a pre-hearing with the NCAA committee
on enforcement.

It is here, according to NCAA Director
of Enforcement Mark Jones, that the two
sides will raise issues on specifics —
such as credibility of witnesses.

After the issues are decided, the case
goes to a hearing in front of the
enforcement committee. From there,
Jones estimates that most decisions and
penalties are handed down within two
weeks.

For Jaynes, who has endured heart
surgery and a major department restruc-
turing since coming to Pitt in 1991, the
added anxieties of an NCAA investiga-
tion has yet to dampen his positive atti-
tude about the future of Pitt’s athletic
department — nor his levity.

“We need to get this going —- do
what we have to — and look ahead,”
Jaynes said, adding that he can see light
at the end of Pitt’s gloomy tunnel. “I just
hope it’s not an oncoming train.”

Panthers‘ strong finish

For The Pitt News

For the past four years, Pitt hurdler Allison
Williams has been compared to the two-time
Olympic gold medalist Roger Kingdom.
Kingdom, a former Pitt great, holds the world
record in the 110-meter high hurdles.

But when asked about her comparison to
Kingdom, Williams will tell
you she does not like to be
compared with male hurdlers.
Allison would rather stand
alone.

“People still compare me to
Roger (Kingdom), Eric
(Cannon) and Elbert (Ellis),”
Williams said. “They were
hurdlers on the men’s team. I
am a hurdler on the female
team. I would hope the
women’s program at Pitt has
enough credentials to stand
on its own.” 

Williams hopes to add to
those credentials by winning
the 100-meter hurdles at the NCAA
Championships June 2-5. The storybook end-
ing would be a ﬁtting career topper for the
woman destined to go down in history as the
most successful hurdler in Pitt women’s track-
and-field history.

For the few people who don’t know much
about the hurdling phenom, Williams is a
senior from Bayshore, New York, who, in
1990, established herself as one of the
nation’s top track-and-field performers. She is
the first female hurdler from Pitt to obtain All-
American status.

Besides Williams’ tremendous hurdling abil-
ity, she also carries a 3.14 grade point average
as an exercise science major. For her hard

  

Williams was awarded the Blue-Gold award
at the seniors’ award banquet. The Blue-Gold
awards are presented annually to the male
and female student—athletes who best repre-
sent the student-athlete ideal based on acade-
mic scholarship, athletic achievement, leader-
ship qualities and citizenship.

Williams, who hopes to attend physical
therapy school in the near
future, credits Pitt head coach
Steve Lewis for her success in
the classroom.

“He is the main reason the

has a high graduation rate,”
Williams said. “Coach Lewis
stresses that college [athletics]
cannot be your center in life.
He say a person's focus in life
is to be the best person they
gcan be.”

3 When Williams was not get-
iting “A's” in the classroom,

Pitt SPOTIS ll“f9.“ﬁl3ti°‘l she was breaking records on
Pitt senior Allison

the track.

During her rookie season, Williams accom-
plished more things than the average athlete
accomplishes in her career. As a first-year
performer, she was crowned Big East champi-
on in the indoor 55-meter hurdles, breaking
the school ‘record in the process. Her rookie
success continued during the spring outdoor
season as well. Williams broke Pitt’s outdoor
100-meter hurdles record and helped the
Panthers win their first Big East conference
championship by winning the hurdles and
running on the winning mile relay.

By season’s end, everyone involved with
Pitt track knew there was something special
about this hurdler.

gives hope

By Steve Kozarovich
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s track and field
team saved the best for last in
this weekend’s 117th
Intercollegiate Association of
Amateur Athletes of America
meet at William and Mary
College in Virginia.

Several Panthers earned All-
East honors at the meet, pacing
the Panthers to a tie for a 16th

Men's Track

place finish in a ﬁeld of over 80
teams. All-East honors are
awarded to all who finish in
the top eight spots in their
respective events.

“Everybody did their best this
weekend,” Pitt track coach
John Vasvary said. “We started
the season real slow, but the
team really came on in the last
few meets of the season, which
gives me great hope for next
year.”

First—year speedster Jay Jones
sprinted his way to fifth place
in the 100-meters with a time
that was the fourth-fastest in
Pitt men’s track history. Jones’
performance helped ease the
pain of not being able to run
the 100-meters in the Big East
Tournament because of a false
start disqualification. In the
IC4As Jones showed hints of
what might have been as he
finished ahead of all the Big

East 100-meter sprinters in the
event this weekend.

Jones, Curtis Anderson, Brian
Whitley and Jay Murphy shared
the honors as the 4x100-meter
relay team that ran seventh in
their competition [41.61].
Sophomore Wes Alexander also
earned All-East honors by plac-
ing sixth in the 110-meter hur-
dles with his best time of the
year.

In the field events, Pitt had
two more All-East athletes. Jim
Monk threw the shotput the
fourth-longest distance in Pitt
history [53-1 1/2 ], placing fifth
among his competitors. Junior
Scott Bailey used his best throw
ever [194-4] in the javelin to fin-
ish eighth in the event.

Highlighting the Panthers’
distance events was Frank
Nesko, who was eighth in the
5,000 meters [14:32.94].

“Considering how young we
are, I think we really had a
great season,” Nesko said. “We
even finished fourth in the Big
East Tournament despite not
having people in the mile relay,
pole vaulter or triple jumper.

“I’m_reaHy excited about next
year. We’re a young team, and
we have eight new guys com-
ing in.”

more impressive when compar-
ing the team’s size to that of

Pitching /eeys Bacs swoon, Phils rise

As Barry Bonds continues
his rampage through the
National League and Giants
fans continue to profess their
unwoithiness to their new
hero, Pirate faithfuls are left
watching Bonds’ former team
dance around the .500 mark.

Pittsburgh can only think
about how much its beloved
(by some) Bucs miss Bonds
-— almost as much as they
miss Doug Drabek and Zane
Smith.

Bonds is the best player of
the three, and he has lifted
San Francisco to the top of
the NL West. It was his
departure that Pirate fans
dreaded, but the loss of two
consistent producers in the
rotation has been the clown-
fall of the Pirates through the
first 40-plus games of the
season.

The often-bombed Bucs’
earned run average of 4.82
(through Saturday’s games) is
the second—highest total in
the National League, worsted
only by the expansion
Colorado Rockies.
Remember, it is front page
news in Colorado if any
starter in I)on Baylor’s rota-
tion makes it past the fifth
inning. I mean, the Rockies’
(or is it Rocked) pitching staff
is responsible for more
objects in orbit than NASA,
but I digress.

Would-be Bucco ace Tim
Wakefield has been a bust so
far, and there isn't a starter
with an ERA under four.
Despite a decent start by
closer Stan Belinda, the
bullpen hasn’t been much
better.

Don’t blame the defense
which has been outstanding
despite the loss of Bonds’

Ryan
Buncher

golden glove in left field.
Only the Braves have made
fewer errors than the Pirates,
who have been anchored by
the fielding brilliance of
shortstop Jay Bell and center
ﬁelder Andy Van Slyke.

Those two have also
anchored a Pirate attack that,
without Bonds, is fifth in the
league in runs scored.
Although Van Slyke (.329
average with 31 RBIs) lost
the advantage of having
Bonds behind him, he has
gained from Bell’s great start
(.319).

Don Slaught has been as
solid as ever, and Orlando
Merced has been unbeliev-
able (.572, third in the NL).
They have even gotten
decent production from the

platoon of Al Martin and
Lonnie Smith in the long.
troublesome leadoff spot.

The Pirates can score runs,
and they still have the best
manager in baseball, as Jim
Leyland makes master strokes
in between puffs on his ciga-
rette, but the pitching staff is
leaving them in exactly the
same boat as the rest of the
NL East — looking up at the
Phillies.

The division was there to
be run away with for any
team able to put all the
pieces together, and
Philadelphia has done just
that.

The Phillies are the anti-
Bucs — with enough talent
to overcome erratic defense
and fundamentals. john Kruk
is the poster boy for this
crew. His game and his gut
may be ugly, but he gets the
job done, hitting to the tune
of a .365 average. He and
sluggers Dave Hollins and
Darren Daulton have pow-
ered a Philadelphia attack
that has prospered despite a
slow start from sparkplug
Lenny Dykstra.

The return of Tommy
Greene fr()m injury problems
and credible jobs by Ben
Rivera and Danny Jackson
have given the Phillies a solid
rotation. The antics of closer
Mitch Williams may yet drive

Bues blank Marlins

By Ryan Buncher
Senior Staff Writer

The last time Steve Cooke
took the mound for the Pirates,
he gave up only one run in
eight innings, but the bullpen
blew the lead and he got a no-
decision.

Last night, the second-year
left-hander took matters into
his own hands, pitching his
first major league shutout as
the Bucs edged Florida, 2-0.
Cooke also provided the
offense, driving in both Pirate
runs with a two—run double in
the fifth.

The victory in their first meet-
ing ever with the expansion
Marlins brought the Pirates
back to the .500 mark I21-21].

Cooke struck out five and
gave up only four hits, evening
his mark for the season at 2-2.
It is the first shutout of the sea-

son for the Bucs.

“I felt like I was going to
pitch the whole game after the
first inning,” Cooke said. “The
big key for me is if I get
through the first inning giving
up no runs."

Florida starter Charlie Hough
matched Cooke zero for zero
until the bottom of the fifth.
Kevin Young opened the frame
by driving an offering from the
Hough through the left side
for a single. After Don Slaught
struck out, Carlos Garcia
reached base on an infield hit,
bringing up Cooke. Hough’s
first pitch to Cooke was wild,
moving the runners to second
and third. Cooke then singled
down the third base line, plat-
ing Young and Garcia.

Game two of the three game
series is tonight at 7:35 pm.

Caught Stealing: The Pilot Episode

Caught Stealing is a weekly qztipfest
concerning the pertinent and not—so-perti-
nent issues in the ridiculous world of sports.
All blips, boasts and blunders are compiled
by the sports staff of The Pitt News.

Week one is dedicated to the cast of
“Cheers,” the place where everybody kn...
oh nevermind. They finished up 11 mega-
lucrative years of laughs last Thursday '
night ——- okay, enough already. Good luck.

(Peer pressure props, guys. Everybody’s
doin’ it, why not us, too?).

0 Stanley, oh Stanley, oh Stanley [and
we’re not talking Cup]. Ya think you’d
learned a bit about that achy breaky
heartache schtick thatlbeds with failure
(see Game seev  it’s so hard to say).
Some things never change. '

Two blown saves. Two Tums, please.

Here’s a tip, Mr. Belinda. Get a breaking
pitch  and stick to a full windup, pal.
Y’aint foolin ‘em with that semblance of a
stretch, pal.

0 Meeechigan’s Chris Webber (man—child
still learning), Kentucky star Jamal
Mashbum (refined player with a great out-
side game) or the jolly thin red—head,
Shawn Bradley (can you say Howdy
Doody on steroids?)

What do you say Magic’s brass? Throw a
Penny in the pickins and you can’t lose.
One out of 66 sounds pretty good now,
huh?

In a related story, David Stern
announced today that the Orlando Magic
and the Chicago Bulls will be the only two
teams in the NBA next year.

0 Jesse who? Missed it doin’ that blink-
ing thing with my eyes. Gotta rewet those
contacts.

Up next for Bowe? The old guy who

barefoot skis in those MTV-like commer-
cials. That or Mickey “got—some-Right-
Guard” Rourke. '

Vegas odds for Bowe-Ski Guy: 5-2 for
the fossil. Buddy Ebsen gets the winner,
Jethro the promoter.

0 Down Note of the Week: Class act
Lenny Wilkens resigning from the
Cleveland Cadavers after seven loyal and
underappreciated years. Thanks for the
days, Len  and no thanks to the Cavs’
true marshmallow men —— Hot Rod and
Daugherty — for playing with all the zeal
of the NY Mets in the ‘93 playoffs.

When Cavs’ mega-point guard Mark
“take that, Bratty Pippen” Price gets traded
elsewhere, look no further to the big men
with no fight as the cause.

Can you say “pathetic?”

0 Nice guys finish last award goes to Tony
Perez for being dumped after only 44
games as manager of the Reds—in-the-Face.
Great player or not, a guy with no coach-
ing experience should never be manager,
but ﬁring him so quickly compounds one
mistake with another At least he's away
from SCl‘lOtLZi€.

0 Headline after Bowe—Lewis slugfest, set
for 1997: Riddick who?

0 Just when the Braves started to play
like the heavy favorites they are, Deion
“pay—me-what-I—want—not-what-I’m worth”
Sanders is back. This human testament to
selﬁsh play and over-inﬂated ego is more
trouble than he is worth in Atlanta. Too
bad money can’t buy class.

Quit whining and take your $11 million
to sit on the bench, stiff.

0 Here’s a thought to ponder:

Suppose that Markus Naslund is in a
Pens uni come October. Now suppose that
the rumored deal sending Jaromir Jagr to

Ottawa for the first pick in the upcoming
draft goes through. The Pens surely don’t
need another franchise player, so they
trade down a few spots and pick up Hobie
Baker Award winner Paul Kariya of Maine
U. with the third or fourth pick, plus a
quality player or two.

This could set up a number-two scoring
line of Ron Francis at center, and young
studs Naslund and Kariya on the wings.
Add this to the number-one line of
Lemieux-Stevens-Tocchet, a top—five defen-
sive unit, one of the league’s top goalies
and a bevy of quality roleplayers.

Scary thought.

0 This just in: The National Broadcasting
Company, also known as NBC [or Nuthin’
But Crap  save “Seinfeld”] has been
renamed Shaq TV.

Scheduled for the fall lineup: “House of
Shaq,” “Shaq Unplugged,” “Late Night with

Up for “Pass” auditions: Jamal “Anarchy-

need—a-belt” Webber and Anfernee “don’t—

Los Angeles hospital after she rolled down
her steps laughing uncontrollably. She is
said to be in fine spirits.

0 On to the never-to-be-National Hockey
League, where The Alleged Late Great One

ion [see LA Kings, Stanley Cup Playoffs,

of these other schools
have 40-plus guys run-
ning with our 15.”

On a disappointing
note, Panther junior
decathlete Tim Flanders,
who was sitting in sev-
enth place in the
decathlon after nine
events on Sunday, was
forced to sit out the final
event when he pulled his
hamstring.

“l was pretty disap-
pointed with my perfor-
mance, but I was real
happy about the team
doing well,” Flanders
said.

Though no Pitt men’s
track athletes qualified
for the National
Championships, opti-
mism is high. Vasvary
feels the Panthers’ pro-
gram is on the upswing.

“Our youth has Carried
us this year, and we
hope it will continue that
way,” Vasvary said.

THE Pl’l~'l"NEWS, W

Williams

Coutinuedfmm page 10

For Assistant Coach Keisha
Dumas, a former teammate of
Williams, the driving force
behind the senior hurdler’s suc-
cess is the ability to stay
focused.

“Allison has natural talent
and is a perfectionist when it
comes to hurdlers,” Dumas
said. After coming off a sopho-
more season in which she qual-
ified for the NCAA champi-
onships in the hurdles for both
the indoor and the outdoor
seasons —- breaking her own
records in both events -
Williams was forced to skip her
junior season because of stress
fractures in both shins. Despite
missing the Olympic trials,
Williams found the year off
beneficial.

“Taking last year off is bet-
ter,” Williams said."My body
needed a rest because running
all year long started to wear on
me. Plus, even though I took a
year off, I’m still running as fast
as anyone else,” Williams said.

Whatever the reason -
whether it was rest or just fate
— Williams overcame the
obstacle of last season’s injury
and propelled herself to the top
of the collegiate track-and-field
world once again. .

In the Big East Indoor
Championships, Williams set a
new conference record for the
55-meter hurdles with a record
time of 7.64 second. In the
same event during the NCAA
Championship, Williams took
sixth place and regained her
All—American status.

The highlight of her career
came a month ago when she
won the 100-meter hurdles at
the Penn Relays in
Philadelphia. Her winning time
of 13.16 at the Relays is cur-
rently ranked third in the
nation by Track and Field
News. For her stupendous
effort, Williams was named the
1993 Penn Relays’ Woman
Athlete Most Valuable
Performer. She calls the presti-
gious award the pinnacle of her
athletic career.

“This was the highlight of my
career because my high school
and college teams were there
to see me receive the award,”
Williams said.

manager Jim Fregosi to the grave, but
the addition of middlemen I..arry
Anderson and David West has provided
solid relief in Philadelphia.

Pathetic play in the middle infield and
injuries — Anderson is on the DL with
an inﬂamed shoulder —— are bigger con-
cerns to the Phils than the rest of the
division. '

The second-place Expos, anchored by
the best outfield in the game, were the
first to make a run. While Atlanta’s
vaunted crew stumbled out of the gate,
the Montreal trio of Moises Alou,
Marquis Grissom and Larry Walker have
exploded to a great start. ‘With Greg
Colbrunn settling in at first base and
Mike Lansing doing a solid job (.307
average) at third, the Expos have gotten
production out of two questionable
areas. .

The problem is the team’s batteries
have done little to charge this crew up.
The catching has been pretty bad north
of the border, and with the exception of
Ken Hill, the rotation is a mess. Even
Dennis Martinez is struggling. Closer

John Wetteland’s return from a brain-
lock induced toe injury helps, but pitch-
ing is keeping this team from seriously
challenging Philadelphia.
Third place and no Met sightings yet.
The Cardinals have some good hitters

and a solid pitching staff, but so far their
trademark defense has let them down.
Age is taking the luster off of Ozzie
Smith’s golden glove, as the Wizard
already has seven errors. Third baseman
Todd Zeile has been playing like the

converted catcher he is, with nine errors.

Surely the Mets are in fourth. Nope —
try Chicago.

After a year of solid pitching, the Cubs
are back to normal — a bunch of out-
standing hitters who never seem to pro-
duce as many runs as they should and
pitchers who find ways to lose games.
They desperately miss Greg Maddux.

Fifth is the Bucs so — no, the Mets
can’t possibly be behind the Marlins.

Yes, they can. ,

The expansion Florida Marlins are
ahead of New York, with room to spare
no less. Unlike their rookie brethren in
Colorado, the Marlins have put together

a passable pitching staff with the help of
Ryan Bowen’s emergence, Bryan
Harvey’s return from injuries and Jack
Armstrong’s return from awful pitching.

Although Japanese import Orestes
Destrade has been nothing near another
Cecil Fielder and Florida got its first taste
of high-priced free-agent ﬂops with
Benito Santiago, they have built a decent
lineup around Dave Magadan, Walt
Weiss and Jeff Conine.

Now the Mess, I mean Mets.

Boo Bobby Bo all you like, New
Yorkers [and you have], but the same
problems that have killed the Mets for
years are doing it again — pathetic
defense, a gasoline-on-the-fire crew of
middle relievers and a starting rotation
that is nowhere near as good as it looks
on paper.

If things hold as they are, the Phillies
or one of their pursuers, would win a
prize other than the division title — a
chance to watch Bonds ﬂop for another
team in the playoffs. There now, doesn't
that make Pirate fans feel better?

to inspect remain conﬁdential.
- Students have a right to challenge the accuracy of records.
- The insﬁtution may not release student records outside the institution without student cons-
ent, unless one of several exceptions applies.
- Requests external to the institution for information regarding students should be document-
ed, as should releases of student information.
- The University may establish categories of information known as “Directory Information"

The refusal to permit directory infomiation is permanent. Rescinding of this action can be done by
the student submitting the request in writing to the Coordinator of the Student Judicial System. ,
