Apolice officer was shot and killed
at Virginia Tech University on
Thursday, putting the site of the

worst mass -murder ofcollegle stu-

dents in the U._S. into lockdown.

A A campus—wide security alert
system, VT alerts, notiﬁed students
‘and faculty of the shooting, advis-
ing them to stay indoors and re-
main secure. According to Virginia
Tech’s website, “Shortly"after noon
[Thursday], a Virginia Tech police
ofﬁcer stopped a vehicle during a

routine traffic stop in the Coliseum .

parking lot near McComas Hall.
Duringgthe traffic stop, the ofﬁcer
was shot and killed.” '
“Our hearts are broken again
for our friend and police ofﬁcer,”
Virginia Tech President Charles

Steger said at a Thursday news
conference. Q
Local and state police helped

investigate the shooting, and one _

officer discovered a suspicious per-
son dead near where the weapon

Q was discovered. Police will not say
whether the second -body was that ; 3
of the shooter, but Steger did ‘sayf “
at the conference that it is believed 1‘

- the shooter killed himself.

At 4:30 p.m., students and fac-
ulty were notiﬁed that there was no
longer an active threat, the lock-
down was lifted, and they could
“resume normal activities.”

If Pitt’s campus ever becomes
the center of an emergency, Pitt

spokesman john Fedele said the-

Philosophy professorearns Germans’ highest award

Mary Mallampalli
Staﬁ‘ Writer

A Pitt philosophy professor re-
ceived Germany’s highest award
on Thursday. N

Nicholas Rescher was present-
ed with the Off1cer’s Cross of the
Order of Merit at the University
Club, in front of about 75 guests.
Busso Von Alvensleben, consul
general of the Federal Republic of
Germany, presented the award.

Rescher, 83, worked closely
with the German government
throughout his career as are-

nowned systematic philosopher. ‘

He tries to use philosophy to ex-

plain questions and problems re-
lated to human life. Now he teach-
es courses on logic, philosophy of
science and history of philosophy,
among others.

“Professor Rescher has long
been one of the most respected
and beloved members of our fac-
ulty. His accomplishments arejust
amazing,” said Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg, who gave opening
remarks. “For the German gov-
ernment to recognize what he has

H done through their highest award
really is awonderful reﬂectionon -

him and really makes everyone at

the University feel good.”
Throughout his years as a

philosopher, editor, writer and

distinguished professor, Rescher
worked closely with other aca-
demics to translate the works of
philosophers from the 17th cen-
tury, including those of Gottfried
Leibniz, a famous German phi-
losopher and mathematician.

“I had done a lot of work in
philosophy, and I’ve done a lot
of contact work between Ger-
man philosophers and American
philosophers,” Rescher said. “It
feels great [to be honored with
this award.] It’s always nice to have
people appreciate what one is try-

ing to do. It’s very gratifying to get A

a pat on the back, as it were.”
Last year, Pitt recognized Re-
scher for his 50 years of service by

establishing the Nicholas Rescher
Prize for Contributions to System-
atic Philosophy.

Since he received his doctor-
ate from Princeton University and
joined Pitt’s philosophy depart-
ment in 1961, Rescher, a native
of Hagen, Germany, has written
more than 100 books — many of
which have been translated into

A other languages — as well as hun-

dreds of journal articles.

The professor also served as
thepresident of the American
Philosophical Association and as
the editor of three journals — the
American Philosophical Quar-
terly, the History of Philosophy
Quarterly and the Public Affairs

Quarterly.

In his studies of ancient Ger-
many philosophy, Rescher also
discovered Leibniz’s idea of a ma-
chine that could decipher complex
texts. The machine was apparently
used in the 17th century, and Re-
scher is working with the Ger-
man government to reconstruct
the machine, according to Von
Alvensleben.

“You only get this award if you
excel in your merits and services
to the country. Here it is in [Re-
scher’s] achievements in philoso-
phy to Germany. We think that this
is wonderful, and that we should
honor him for his achievement,”
Von Alvensleben said. I

Greeks complete $500,000 pledge to Cancer Institute

Mahita Gajanan
For The Pitt News

They approached it one week at
a time, and after six years, the
Greeks achieved their goal.

The University’s fraternity and
sorority members celebrated the
completion of their $500,000
pledgeto the University of Pitts-
burgh Cancer Institute Thursday
night at the O’Hara Student Cen-
ter Ballroom.

“Tonight, we celebrate the
fact that you did it,” Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg said to about
100 Greeks crowded into the
Ballroom. _

In 2005, the Greeks signed
a contract with UPCI to raise
$500,000 to go toward a lung and
thoracic cancer research labora-
tory in Pittsburgh.

' The donation is the largest
giftlcommitment from any or-
ganization on campus and the
largest donation UPCI has ever
received.

Greek Week co-presidents
Kari ‘Rosenkaimer and Keaton
Macut presented a large check
to Dr. Edward Chu, chief -of the Di-
vision of Hematology/Oncology
and deputy director of the UPCI,
and Dr.Jill Siegfried, a professor
in the department of pharmacol-
ogy and chemical biology and
UPMC endowed chair for lung
cancer research.

Originally, the Greeks planned
to fulfill the contract in five years;

A Moveable Feast

Even suspected criminals, it
seems, aren’t immune to senti-
mentality. According to the Na-
ples Daily News, police arrested a
Florida shopper for stulﬁng four
steaks and two candles down his
trousers. Although it’s unclear
‘whether the suspect planned to
meet his girlfriend afterwards
—— once he cleaned the steaks,
presumably — we think this is
the perfect setup for a date: The
night starts in the pants and ends
in the pants.

Rated M for Mundane

Merciless Call of Duty players
can rest easy: The International
Committee of the Red Cross as-
sured reporters that, contrary
to recent rumors, they have no
plans to apply the Geneva Con-
ventions to video games. We
couldn’t be more relieved. If
those laws governed the virtual
world, our Grand Theft Auto ses-
sions would consist of strolling
well-lit corners of the city, pur-
chasing every car and reporting
petty crimes to police.

Ashes to Cash

A New Hampshire woman
lost both a family member and a
gambling incentive when an-urn
containing her mother’s ashes,
which she used in Bingo games
as a good luck charm, was stolen.
Although we wish her the best
of luck in reclaiming the ashes,
we’re conﬁdent her mother still

watches over her —— gambling
addictions, after all, never die.

Balls to the Wall

“MythBusters” hosts Adam
Savage and Jamie Hyneman

' consistently risk their own lives

when testing outlandish rumors,
but this is probably the ﬁrst time
they’ve imperiled unwitting by-
standers. This Tuesday, during
one of the show’s invariably sen-
sational experiments, an errant
cannonball blasted through a
cinder block wall, ﬂew through
an occupied bedroom, soared
over six lanes of thoroughfare
and ﬁnally collided with a parked
minivan. Although it’s unclear
what, exactly, Savage and Hyne—
man were trying to prove, the

myth of their competence has '

most assuredly been busted.‘
False Advertising

Doubtlessly, Florida resident

Shawn Porter expected nothing,

more than courteous, efficient
service when he and a friend
ordered a “blunt and some
herbs” at a Burger King drive-
thru. Instead of satisfying the
request, however, the restaurant
supervisor gave Po_rter’s license
plate number to police (appar-
ently, his car already smelled like
marijuana), who intercepted him
outside his house. Needless to
say, we’re appalled: How many
other Burger King branches de-
viate from the “Have it your way”
slogan?

“lifestyle changes’’—don’t ‘ story — “Do we de-
work. Multiple studies show monise the obese purely
that 95 to 98 percent of people on health grounds or is it a

who intentionally lose weight
gain it back within ﬁve years. And
other studies show that the weight ﬂu,c—
tuations that accompany failed diets are worse
for you than being overweight and just staying
that way. But you still think fat people should lose
weight for their health, even though losingweight
makes them less healthy?

You don’t hate fat people, but of course you
feel kind of judgmental when you see afat person
shoveling down high-calorie food. It’s like, to-

when you see someone thin put away three or
four slices of pizza, you’re either indifferent or
moved to congratulate, even though those four
slices of pizza are wreaking the same havoc
on their circulatory system they would on a
fat person’s. You also don’t have the same gut
reaction to people smoking, binge drinking or
using energy drinks to pull all-nighters.

You — you the doctor, the school or the .
government agency —— are only concerned
about fat people’s health, which is why you
evaluate their wéight and risk factors based
on Body Mass Index. BMI is a meaningless
equation easily skewed by height, takes no
account ofbody composition — many seri-
ous athletes are obese, according to BMI — -
and hasn’t been considered a legitimate
health measurement in years.

But more reliable ways of deter-
miningwhethera person is obese
are just so much more expen-
sive and time— consuming. Why

gut reaction based on preju-
dice?” —— is very telling. Bluntly:
How in the hell do you demonize

someone for their health? When has mak-
ing people feel terrible ever been good for them
or for society as awhole?
Weight might not be the new race, but fat
people today do have a commonality with black
people years‘ ago in that they’re not allowed to
play themselves in movies. While old-time min-
strel shows hired white people to paint their
faces black and personify buffoonish “black”
caricatures, fat people in movies today are
frequently played by thin actors in fat suits.

What does that have to do with health? Are

studios afraid that fat actors will drop dead
on the set or that _if they hire them they’ll
spend all their money on Twinkies? More
likely, as suggested in Bitch Magazine’s “Are

fat suits the new blackface?” fat characters
are usually the butts of jokes on screen, and
laughing at such a bald-faced mockery of a
real person’s body would make audiences
feel mean. Thin actors in fat suits assuage
audience guilt. .
That suggests — and in case you hadn’t
noticed, I agree —— that public derision of
the overweight isn’t motivated by health
concerns at all, but by something less
straightforward — and uglier.
People who want to defend
their disdain for the obese or
their promotion of policies,
such as employer discrimi-
nation and “fat taxes” that

ogy when you’re evaluating penalize the “overweigh ,”

Swearing uncreative, irresponsible

Columnist

“I hate exams. My professor is so
mean. I wish I could sleep all the
time.” - _
We say things like this every day.
Usually, though, we like to sprinkle
in a few choice words that more ap-
propriately express our negativity.
College is the perfect time for
students to ‘
turn into potty

want, I think situationswhere

bad language is and eh

abad habit. ,
There’s a rea-

son we suppress

our language when were around our

parents and teachers: Their genera-

tion mostly frowns on swear words.

‘While some of our parents still curse

like sailors, others continue to disci-
pline their children for cursing.
This generation gap is particularly
pronounced in the workplace, where
we’re supposed to wear our bestface.
Our superiors are generally much
older than us and have the same val-

ues as our parents. It’s considered '

unprofessional inaformal setting to
swear about your bad weekend orto
curse about spilled coffee. '

* Even in classrooms, respect is a
key principle for students and teach-
ers. A classroom is a place for learn-
ing, not swearing.

There are numerous situations
in which swearing is inappropriate,
and I’ve noticed that college students
are increasingly disregarding them.
Some would construe this as pro-
gressive — our generation is mere-
ly going against antiquated social
conventions — but I think our potty
mouths need to stay at home orwith
our friends.

Has our generation lost a sense

of professionalism and etiquette?
If appropriate
language is the

Ueﬂe? it matters, our
language must
remain clean.

N atu rally,
problems arise when trying to re-
habilitate a generation that’s already
taken to swearing like a (something
to a something).

Some colleges have instituted

monetary ﬁnes for cursing. Hinds ’

Community College in Mississippi,
USA Today reported, ﬁnes students

$25 for aﬁrst offense of “public pro- p

fanity, cursing and vulgarity.” In a
suburb of Dallas, North Mesquite
High School ﬁned a student $637 for
a poorly chosen word, according to
The Washington Post.

But I don’t believe ﬁnes are go-
ing to help our generation overcome
theirfoul-mouthed tendencies. Fines
can help us remember not to speed
or jaywalk, but they cannot change

an ingrained habit. Instead they just
inspire anger, resentment —- even
rebellion.

Change has to come’ from us.

~ We’re the ones who should recognize

poor behavior and do something to
alter it. Of course, as anyone who’s
tried to quit biting his nails or pick-
ing her nose knows, eliminating a
bad habit is extremely difficult. Nev-
ertheless, there are many self-help
techniques available — you’ll just
need to ﬁnd the one that works best
for you.

Personally, I’ve found that self-
imposed monetary donations are
effective. In my younger days, my
mom_ made my brother and I donate
a quarterwhenever we succumbed to

» a bad habit. When we ﬁnally elimi-

nated it, she donated the money to
a local charity. Apply this same solu-
tion in college — put a quarter in a jar
every time you swear. It won’tbe long
before you realize you haven’t done
laundry for weeks and you actually
really needed those quarters.

The most tried-and—true strat-
egy for breaking a habit, of course,
is simply practicing. If you’re wor-

ried about using foul language at ’
work, start by ensuring that you’re

not speaking crudely at home. If you
can handle your speech there, your
newfound restraintwill easily adapt
to situations where sharp tongues are
inappropriate.

My favorite way to break the habit
is the simple “search and replace”
theory. Every time you realize you’re
beginning to utter a swear word, re-

’ place it with another, less crass word.

There are many common substitutes,
such as “ﬁldge” or “goshdarnnit,”
but it’s much more ﬁin to create your
own. i _ I
After all, I’ll take, “Holy starfish,
Batman,” to any swear word you can
think of.

Shaming leads to
eating disorders

lations ofhow much each fat person is
costing our nation. But it’s a bit more
complicated than that.

Correlation does suggest that fat
people are, on average, getting sick
more often than thin people. But any
analysis of that fact is confounded by
the hate our society heaps on them.
Fat people are strongly encouraged
to diet, which does a lot of long-
term health damage. Furthermore,
researchers have found that over-
weight youth have the same risks
for disordered eating behaviors like
extreme dietingor“purging”astheir
thin counterparts and higher risks for
binge eating disorder. Are fat people

at higher risks for health issues down
the line because they’re fat orbecause
they’re disproportionately inclined
to have eating disorders and weight-
ﬂuctuations? j

Eating disorders and fad dieting
among the obese areunequivocally
linked to the way we harass and shame
fat people, talkabout themlikethey’re
a public menace and defend denying
them employment due to their size.
Yet we do all those things, suppos-
edly, because we’re so very concerned
about their health. When are we going
to stop kidding ourselves? .

Letter to the editor

To the Editor:

I understand that reading about
raises for Pitt’s more highly com-
pensated officials during these dif-
ﬁcult economic times can cause an
emotional response. But I believe
your editorial, “Ofﬁcials’ raises
slight students,” is unfairly criti-
cal of this action by‘ the Board of
Trustees. I have been at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh for 18 years

and was witnessto “life before”-

our current administration. Those
were days when the University suf-
fered from ﬁnancial difliculties,
low numbers of applicants and dis-
mal staff morale. The University
that today’s students know is far
different from the Pitt of 18 years
ago. People are proud to work at
Pitt; applications for our fresh-
men class are at an all-time high;
our faculty are world leaders in
their ﬁelds of study; and despite
extreme economic challenges,
we are on solid ﬁnancial ground.

The reason for these signiﬁcant
changes at our University is the
outstanding leadership, provided
largely by these oflicers, that has
guided us for the past 16 years.
No one would argue with

A your point that students are an

important part of the’ success of
this University. But I believe you

inaccurately trivialize the role of

faculty, staff and administration
in the University’s tremendous
period of prominence. Our Uni-
versity has progressed as a result
of havingmany outstanding stu-
dents, world-renowned faculty,
dedicated staff and visionary and
courageous leadership. It has been
a very deliberate and collabora-
tive team effort. To diminish the
importance of even just one part
of this community is unfair.

MEN'S BASKETBALL ll

Pitt to face Oklahoma State in New York City

Greg Trietley
in Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s basketball team’s
home away from home hasn’t
been too friendly recently.

The Panthers have gone just
3-5 at Madison Square Garden
since they won the Big East tour-
nament there in 2008. From
Dwight Hardy’s controversial
game-winning layup last Febru-
ary to Kemba Walker’s step-back
btrzzer-beater over Gary McGhee
in March, Pitt has struggled at
the world’s most famous arena.

The Garden hosts the Pan-
thers (8-1) again Saturday af-
ternoon when they face the
Oklahoma State Cowboys (6-2)
at 2:30 p.m. in the Carquest Auto
Parts Classic.

The Cowboys enter the game
in an offensive slump. Despite
a three—game winning streak,
they rank last in the Big 12 with
a‘2t3.4 percent shooting percent-
age. They are also last in their
conference in assists per game
(10.6).

I-’Iighly—touted freshman
Le’Bryan Nash leads the Cow-
boys with 12.6 points per game.
Nash, named to the Wayman
Tisdale Award Preseason Watch
List alongside Khem Birch and 10
other freshmen, scored 19 points
and added eight rebounds off
the bench in the Cowboys’ 72-67
victory over Missouri State on
Wednesday.

Senior guard Keiton Page and
sophomore guard Markel Brown
also average double-digit points
for the Cowboys.

=wFor Pitt, an injury to start-
ing point guard Tray Woodall
has brought out the best in Ja-
mie Dixon’s team. The Panthers
put up a season-high 97 points
against Virginia Military Insti-
ttrte Tuesday.

Pitt has averaged 80.1 points
per game this year, the second~
best mark among Big East
schools. Dixon can thank the
hot 3-point shooting of Ashton
Gibbs, Lamar Patterson, _].J.
Nfbore andjohnjohnson for the
offensive surge.

All four players, as well as the
injured Woodall, are averaging at

noon. The Panthers are 3-5 in l\/Iadison Square Garden since the 2008 Big East tournament.

least 41 percent from 3-point
range this season.

“We thought Lamar was going
to be a good shooter. We thought
_I._]. could be a good shooter. I
don’t think we knew about the
other guys,” head coach Jamie
Dixon said after the game Tues-
day. “johnjohnson shot the ball
well. I don’t think I can say 1 pre-
dicted that.”

The freshman Johnson is 11-
of-17 from 3-point range this
season.

Moore went 4-for-6 from deep
in the 97-70 victory over VMI,
and afterward he credited his
teammates for setting screens
to get him_open.

Bobby Mizia I Senior StaffPl otographer

“I saw it in their defense. It
was deﬁnitely What they wer_e
giving me,” Moore said after the
game. “My team was setting a lot
of good screens. Dante [Taylor],
Lamar, and‘ Nasir [Robinson]
were all setting good screens.
They were getting me open and
that was basically good team play
for us.”

Johnson said Tuesday that

‘the team tries to use screens

and quick passes to set up an
open man.

“In practice, we try to play
unselﬁsh and pass the ball more
to get everyone involved,” he
said.

Pitt leads all Big East programs

in assists per game (19.3).

In the paint, Khem Birch
started over Dante Taylor in
the last five games, all Pitt vic-
tories, but,'Dixon said that he
likes how Taylor has played off
the bench.

“Obviously [Taylor] is play-
ing more minutes than Khem is,”

' Dixon said. “He’s been more pro-

ductive and you can’t hide from
the numbers. I kind of like it in
some regards because wehave
such a young group. Our bench
is so young, so we have ajunior
who has been around and knows
what we are doing.”

Taylor is averaging 8.7 points
and 6.1 rebounds this season.I

BIG EAST BREAKDOWN

West Virginia, Louisville top conference rankings

R] Sepich
Staﬁ"Wri ter

Poor quality football might have
plagued the Big East Conference
this season, but there’s no deny-
ing that the conference also had
its fair share of drama.

For the second straight sea-
son, three teams shared the con-
ference title with a 5-2 record in
Big East play. V _

But only one team could
earn the conference’s coveted
BCS bowl bid. This year, West
Virginia came out on top after
the ﬁnal BCS standings had the
Mountaineers ranked above fel-
low co-champions Louisville and
Cincinnati.

So with the regular season
over and the Big East about to
undergo major changes with ﬁve
new teams entering the Confer-
ence and Pitt, Syracuse and West
Virginia ﬁnding new homes with
the ACC and the Big 12, respec-
tively,, here are my ﬁnal rankings
of 2011.

1. West Virginia: The Moun-
taineers (9—3, 5-2 Big East)
needed a last-second ﬁeld goal
to defeat South Florida, but it
was enough to clinch the school
its ﬁrst BCS bid since the 2007
season. Dana Holgorsen’s team
was picked to win the confer-
ence in the coach’s pre-season.
poll, and it did just that in his
first year. A showdown with ACC
champion Clemson in the Orange
Bowl, awaits West Virginia and
star quarterback Geno Smith on
Jan. 4.

2. Louisville: The Cardinals
(7-5, 5-2 Big East) are the most
surprising co-champions. Fresh-
man quarterback Teddy Bridge-
water and his team tookawhile
to get going, but the Cardinals
now look like a team that will
contend for years to come. Un-
expected road wins over rivals
Kentucky and West Virginia will
make this season live long in the
memory of Louisville fans. The
Cardinals will ﬁnish their sea-
son in Charlotte when they face
North Carolina State in the Belk
Bowl on Dec. 27.

3. Cincinnati: Had West Vir-
ginia lost at South Florida last
Thursday, the Bearcats (9-3, 5-2
Big East) would’ve received a bid
to the Orange Bowl. But it was
not to be this season for Butch

a two-game lead in the Big East, .

Cincinnati lost quarterback Zach
Collaros for the season to an in-
jury and failed tojearn its third
BCS bid in four years. Instead,
the Bearcats willlface SEC op-

ponent Vanderbilt in the Liberty

Bowl on New Year’s Eve.

4. Rutgers: Maybe the most
surprising of this year’s Big East
teams, the Scarlet Knights (8-4,
4-3 Big East) proved the coaches
who voted them last in the pre-
season poll wrong by winning
eight games and making a run
at the conference title. Rutgers’
defense — which was one of the
best in the c_ountry in both points
allowed and turnovers forced —
carried the team all season as the
offense endured a quarterback
controversy with two quarter-
backs competing for the starting
spot. The Pinstripe Bowl against
Iowa State on Dec. 30 at Yankee
Stadium in New York is a nice

reward for coach Greg Schiano’s
team. V

5. Pittsburgh: Todd Gra-
ham’s first year as Pitt head
coach wasn’t as successful as he
would’ve liked, but with recruits
Rushel Shell and Chad Voytik
coming in, this team should
have a bright future. The Pan-
thers (6-6, 4-3 Big East) started
2-0, but never won back-to-back

games after that and needed a-

win against Syracuse on Senior
Day just to earn a bowl bid. Pitt
will play in the BBVA Compass
Bowl for the second straight year
on Jan. 7 against the Southern
Methodist Mustangs.

6. Connecticut: The defend-
ing conference champion wasn’t
able to repeat its 2010 heroics.
The Huskies (5-7, 3-4 Big East)
seemed to lack talent all season
and only won a single game away
from home. Connecticut suf-
fered some growing pains while

transitioning to new coach Paul
Pasqualoni’s system. Unless he
manages to put together a few
good recruiting yearsin a row, I

,don’t see, Connecticut reaching a

BCS game again any time soon.

7. South Florida: The Bulls (5-
7, 1-6 Big East) fell just short of
potentially making a bowl game
after.West Virginia’s last—second
ﬁeld goal handed South Florida
its seventh loss. Missing out on a
bowl seemed impossible for Skip
Holtz’s team after its 4-0 start,
but after losing seven of its last
eight games, South Florida must
now begin preparations for next
season.

8. Syracuse: If South Florida’s
ﬁnish to the season is the bad of
Big East football in 2011, then
Syracuse’s must be the ugly. The
Orange (5-7, 1-6 Big East) closed

‘ their campaign with six consecu-

tive defeats, which is all the more
head-scratching considering

their last win was what should
have been a conﬁdence-building,
49-23 blowout win over West Vir-
ginia in mid-October. Syracuse

‘fans should hope for more in

2012 as the team prepares fﬂr
its move to the ACC.

Co-Offensive Players of the
Year: Geno Smith, quarterback,
West Virginia and Mohamed
Sanu, wide receiver, Rutgers —
These two were so good that they
both earned the award. Smith led
the Mountaineers to the Big East
title and needs 47 yards in the
Orange Bowl to break the confer-
ence’s all-time mark for passing
yards in a season. Sanu, mean-
while, had the best season a Big
East receiver has had since for-
mer Pitt wideout Larry Fitzger-
ald. Sanu broke Fitzgerald’s con-
ference record for catches in a
season with 109, which is even
more impressive considering
Rutgers’ inconsistent quarter-
back play all season.

Defensive Player of the Year:
Khaseem Greene, linebacker,
Rutgers -— As the best player
on the best defense in the Big
East, Greene is a deserved win‘-
ner of the conference’s defensive
player ofthe year. Greene —— Pitt
running back Ray Graham’s half-
brother — showed his talent and
versatility by leading the Big East
in tackles during his ﬁrst season
playing the linebacker position
after switching from safety.

Coach of the Year: Charlie
Strong, Louisville -— This award
probably would’ve gone to Butch
Jones if Cincinnati had hung ontqjgk
the outright conference title, but
instead Coach ofthe Year should
go to Louisville’s Charlie Strong.
Nobody predicted the Cardinals
would win the conference com-
ing into 2011, and with the young
core of talent Strong will have
at his disposal next season, his
team might just be the Big East
pre-season favorite in 2012.

What to watch for in the
bowls: Can the Big East compete?
— With all the ﬂack the Big East
takes every season about being
a sub-par football conference,
it’_s always interesting to see how
Big East teams do in post-season
play. West Virginia, Louisville,
Cincinnati, Rutgers and Pitt will
all represent the conference in»
this season’s bowl games as a re-
ward for their successful regular
seasons.

Panthers look to end losing streak against Valparaiso

R] Sepich
Staﬁ" Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball team has lost
three straight games since getting out to a
solid start this season..

‘~ -» Before suffering a blowout loss to George-
town at home on Wednesday, Pitt fell on
the road to both High Point and Duke. Now
the Panthers face the Valparaiso Crusaders
at the Petersen Events Center on Saturday
afternoon..Pitt began the year 4—2.

Pitt head coach Agnus Berenato said she
believes the difficult schedule is helping her
team — the youngest in Division I women’s
basketball — grow up quickly.

“It doesn’t get any easier,” Berenato said
in a press conference after the 82-52 loss
to Georgetown. “We have Valparaiso, and
ffien we go and play Indiana and Michigan
State, and then you all know what the Big
East is like.”

Valparaiso, which will enter Saturday’s
matchup with a 2-6 record, is far from the
best team the Panthers will play this season.
Still, the Crusaders travel to Pittsburgh af-
ter winning two of their last three games.
Valparaiso is also coming off a 64-43 home
victory over Indiana University—Purdue Uni-
versity Fort Wayne on Tuesday night.

“We stayed out of foul trouble, and that

was a key,” Valparaiso head coach Keith Free-
man said in a news release on Valparaiso’s
website. “I think their pressure helped us
on offense because we were able to move
the ball well and had a good balance inside
and outside.”

Sophomore forward Tabitha Gerardot
averages 11.3 points per game and leads Val-
paraiso’s scoring attack. Three other Cru-
saders average at least eight points: Ashley
Varner (9.6 points per game), Shaquira Scott
(9.1 points) and Gina Lange (8.8 points).

Varner, a senior forward, nearly averages
a double—double, pulling down a team—high
9.4 rebounds per game.

Four Crusaders scored in double ﬁgures
and two players ﬁnished with double—dou-
bles as Valparaiso defeated IPFW with a bal-
anced scoring attack. Varner ﬁnished with a
game—high 18points and 12 rebounds, while
Gerardot put up 15 points and grabbed 10
rebounds. '

Valparaiso outrebounded IPFW '38-34
and should provide a challenge for Pitt in-
side. _

To get their record back to .500, the Pan-
thers need to avoid the scoring droughts that
plagued them in their defeat on Wednesday.
Pitt missed 14 shots in nearly 11 minutes

BRIEF

Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editor

The Big East stretched to the West Coast
yesterday by voting to ‘include ﬁve new
members in 2013. ‘ —

Central Florida, Houston and Pitt foot-

. ball’s bowl opponent Southern Methodist
will join the Big East for all sports, while
San Diego State and Boise State will join
for football only.

“Much like the conference as a whole,
the Big East name — though derived 32
years ago based on the geography of our
founding members — has evolved into a
highly respected brand that transcends
borders, boundaries or regions?’ Big East
commijssioner John Marinatto said. “It’s
national.,Oi1r membershipmakeup is now
reflective of that.”

In September, Pitt and Syracuse de-
clared they will leave the Big East Confer-

ence for the Atlantic Coast Conference. .

West Virginia announced its move to the
Big 12 in October. Texas Christian Uni-
versity was set to join the Big East next
season, but instead accepted an invitation
to the Big 12.? A ‘ . ‘

V Since the announcements, the Big East .

and South Florida.

Currently, Marinatto still holds Pitt,
Syracuse and West Virginia to the Big
East’s 27-month waiting period before
they can switch conferences. That would
keep the three schools in the Big East until
the fall of 2014.

But with five teams set to join the con-
ference in 2013 and Marinatto saying that
he wants to add two more football schools,
the three schools could switch conferences

adds five teams

While Pitt and Syracuse aren’t chal-
lenging the 27-month waiting period, West
Virginia filed a suit against the Big East for
the right to join the Big 12 next season.
The Big East responded to West Virginia
by ﬁling its own lawsuit saying that leav-
ing before the 27—month period would be
a breach of contract.

Since then, both West Virginia and the
Big East have ﬁled to have each other’s
lawsuits dismissed. I

“Just keeping attacking,” Pitt center Leeza
Burjdgess said after the game about Pitt’s
struggleto score. “This is our home, and
our shots will fall. We will get the baskets
we need.” ' .
_ Several Pitt players have proven they have
the ability to score.
Seven Panthers are averaging at least ﬁve

’ points per game, including freshman Brianna

Kiesel and sophomore Marquel Davis, who
are averaging 13.3 and 10.6 points, respec-
tively. . I — . ' .

Due to the Panthers’ youth, Berenato ad-
mits that the attitude and spirit of her team
this season might be more important than
wins and losses. ,

“As long as they learn and believe it, then
I’m okay with it,”,B.ere’nato said. “I believe

in our system and what we’re doing. It’s just’,

that they’re young, and they’re going to get
pounded. But they can’t lose the faith.” ﬂ

ing defensive line late in the season. He also
ﬁnished the regular season with 10 sacks
