It may be just November, but the
Pitt men’s basketball team is al-
ready winning tournament games
— and convincingly.

For the second straight evening
at the Petersen Events Center, the
Panthers (3-0) advanced in the
National Invitation’ Tournament
Season Tip-Off bracket with an im-
pressive performance. This time,
Pitt qualiﬁed for the tournament’s
semiﬁnals with a resounding 78-53
victory over a talented and experi-
enced Lehigh (1-2) team.

The semiﬁnal will set up the
Panthers’ ﬁrst matchup against a
ranked team this season, with No.
5 Michigan to be the opponent at
Madison Square Garden in New
York City on Nov. 21 at a to-be-
determined time.

Pitt head coachjamie Dixon was
very pleased with how his team
performed in the important early
season clash.

“Everyone played well — all
10 of our guys,” Dixon said after
the game. “It’s a good win against
a very good team. I liked how we
did it.” ,

Early on, it appeared that the
Panthers would cruise to their
third consecutive easy victory of
the season when junior forward
Lamar Patterson stretched Pitt’s
advantage to 12-5 after converting

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

GB eleo aos ed, retracted

Pitt United’s photos remained hung on

Politics is a dirty game, even here
at Pitt. S

This week, ‘the Student Govern-
ment Board,Elections Committee
— a group of students tasked with
overseeing the SGB elections -
called both of the slates contain-
ing presidential candidates into
hearings to discuss election code
infractions. But those unknown
individuals who ﬁled complaints
about infractions dropped them
before the committee could reach
a decision.

Last year’s Elections Committee
—— whose chair is appointed by the
SGB’president and whose members
are chosen by the chair — dealt

. with zero reported infractions.

However, that hasn’t been the
case this year.

“A lot of disappointing things
have been happening,” said Annie
Brown, the current SGB Elections
Committee chair, appointed by
Presidentjames Landreneau.

At 7:30 a.m. on Tuesday, the
Elections Committee held its ﬁrst
hearing to assess complaints of
infringements on the SGB election
code. Gordon Louderback, current
SGB Board member and presiden-
tial candidate on the Forbes slate,
said his slate was involved with
Tuesday’s hearing, but he declined
to say on what side.

Louderback and Brown also
refused to comment on the oth-
er parties involved in Tuesday’s
hearings and on the speciﬁc com-

plaints, but Brown did say that '

the charges have been withdrawn
because the Elections Committee
had seen “inconsistencies with the
evidence” and was under the im-
pression that some of the evidence
may have been gathered illegally.

The SGB Elections Committee
presides over the hearings and
administers the rulings. In atten-
dance are the complainant and
defendant parties, and whatever
witnesses they choose to bring.
Brown said that punishment of any
parties found guilty would depend
on the severity of the infraction,
and that the most severe infrac-
tions could affect a candidate’s
eligibility to get elected.

The hearings were to continue
into Wednesday, when the Steel

Public outcry over
mzsonfor closing

Shruti Revankar
Stqff Wrz'ter

When Schenley High School
opened in 1916, it was the first
high school in the country to
have cost more than $1 million
to build. Derrick Bell, the first
African-American professor at
Harvard Law School, and Andy
Warhol, a pioneer in the pop art
movement, are just a few of the
alumni who were educated at the
school.

But since closing in 2008,
Schenley has sat on Bigelow
Boulevard in North Oakland ——
less than a mile away from Pitt’s
Cathedral of Learning — bar-
ren and supposedly harboring
an asbestos problem, according
to the city of Pittsburgh School
District.

This sparked an outcry in the
community and among alumni,
parents and students as well.
Many suspected that there was
more to this issue than the school
board had revealed.

As a way to express their in-
credulity and frustration, the
outraged citizens created an
online petition on Change.org
thisiyear, championing an inves-
tigation behind the closing of
the school.

Ben Tinker, class of ’92, wrote
in the online petition that it was
important to investigate the ra-

SGB to bring ‘power ﬂower’ to  next semester

Megan Trimble
Staﬁ” Writer

Students running low on battery power will
have a new place to charge up next semester.

With the creation of acampus “power
ﬂower,” students will have access to outlets
to charge their electronics as they engage
in a sustainable public art project.

The Student Government Board -——— re-
sponsible for distributing funds from the
more than $2 million Student Activities
Fund — discussed the sustainability project
and upcoming SGB election before about
10 people gathered for the public meeting
in Nordy’s Place of the William Pitt Union
Tuesday night.

Board member Julie Hallinan said that
she and Board member Gordon Louderback
have received a contract to build a power
ﬂower — a piece of sustainable public art

that generates electricity through solar _

panels — for student use, but that they
have not worked through the speciﬁc cost

of the structure. Student Affairs willfund
the project, which will take two months to
design and develop. . . _f

The power ﬂower will be designed by
local artist Dave Edwards and will bebuilt
from one of the '

no set structure, which will give them the
opportunity to create a piece with a true
“Pitt feel.” 1 "

dropped the night before.

Brown also declined to comment on the
parties and complaints involved in Wednes-
day’s hearing, but Sowmya Sanapala, a can-

the complaint was that some of her slate’s

the Pitt police in response to the vandalism,
but to no avail. A

In an attempt to combat the nastier tone
of this year’s election, Brown had sent out an

tionale behind the decision made regard-
ing Schenley High School.

“It is critical to understand the true
cost of these abatements before any fur-
ther action is taken and to know if deceit
was at play in the original decision—mak-
ing process,” he wrote.

Annette Werner, one of the leading fig-
ures in this community-wide movement,
said the main purpose of the petition was
to educate board members and to inves-
tigate whether important information
was withheld from the decision makers.

Werner said she held theories as to
why the historic building was closed, but
wasn’t comfortable disclosing them.

Werner indicated that money was

. wasted not too long ago when staff and

students were relocated to another school
at the time of Schenley’s closing, and she
doesn’t want the same mistake to be re-
peated.

“To use Reizenstein [Middle School]'

for three years, they spent $10 to 15 mil-
lion renovating, and moving roboticsto
Peabody [High School]-was $3 million,”
Werner said. “We rushed into things last
time and wasted $20 million.” '

Pittsburgh Public Schools Coordinator
of Public Relations Ebony Pugh declined
to comment on the renovations and ro-
botics move. C

Despite the lack of support from the
community, the school board decided in
September, by a 5-to-4 vote, to sell the
building, with a $4 million asking price.

Jerry Tullius, the manager for this
project from Fourth River Development
-— which is the company in charge of mar-
keting the school —— said that potential
bidders will take a tour of the property
on Nov. 27, followed by a conference on
Nov. 28 that will address any questions
or concerns related to the building. The
questions and concerns posed by attend-
ees brought upin the conference will be
made available to the general public on
the group’s website within one week, ac-
cording to Tullius. 

Although local institutions could po-
tentially purchase the property for their
own use, ofﬁcials from Carnegie Mellon
University, Pitt and UPMC have remained
largely silent on future expansion into the
old high school.

Pitt Spokesmanjohn Fedele and CMU
Spokeswoman.Alyssa Mayfield declined
to comment on this topic. UPMC Spokes-
woman Susan Manko said UPMC has no
plans for the building.

When asked about potential bidders,

 

Tullius said: “We’ve had some preliminary
calls, but we won’t know who’s involved
til the tour.” .

The official reason for closing down
the high school was an asbestos prob-
lem, which the Pittsburgh Public School
District’s Superintendent Mark Roosevelt
and the Chief Operations Officer Richard
Fellers touted to the media and the com-
munity in 2007.

In that same year, Fellers told to the
Pittsburgh City Paper that asbestos was
“in every wall, in every ceiling, on every
ﬂoor.” .

But that same year, when Dan Davis, a
former senior project manager at a con-
sulting agency for the district,-conducted

tests on the plaster samples from the

“school, he cametoa different conclusion.

“Our results showed all the samples
were less than 1 percent asbestos,” he said
in the same City Paper article.

This revelation was the reason behind
the public outrage‘, because the asbestos
problem was the reasoning the superin-
tendent had used to justify closing down
the beloved school.

Despite the amount of controversy and
negativity surrounding the issue, Tullius
is still optimistic for the turnout at the

t tour and conference scheduled for later
this month.

THE LEFT HAND SIDE

Last Tuesday? s election shows America
is ﬁnally becoming a nation for all

Eric Baldwin
Columnist

Last Tuesday night, I was thrilled
to see President Barack Obama
win a second term. However, his
successful re-election wasn’t the
most exciting aspect of the elec-
tion. It was the other, smaller
victories across the country that
excited me the most and are in-
dicative of the changing mindset
of our great country. Tuesday’s
election reﬂected a change toward
respecting accomplishment and
facts rather than empty rhetoric
and money.

Events such as Elizabeth War-

ren winning a senate seat, Tam-
my Baldwin becoming the ﬁrst
openly gay senator and several
other women winning seats indi-
cates changing trends in political
tendencies. Four states granted
marriage equality, and two states
decriminalized the recreational
use of marijuana. These, too, were
victories that indicate the great
strides toward a more diverse, tol-
erant and accepting country. The
citizens of this country took to
the voting booth and overwhelm-
ingly made choices that reﬂect a
renewed belief in allowing people
to pursue their own conception of
the American Dream, whatever

they might be.

i The winning candidates
demonstrated merits with con-
crete plans and strategies, and
the American people showed a
respect for candidates with es-
tablished qualifications. With
Obama winning the presidential
election, we can expect four more
years of moderate liberalism. Per-
haps he’ll get more accomplished
without the haunting spectre of
re-election ahead of him, but his
past four years were lackluster.
It’s the small democratic victories
across the country that will move

this country forward.

Warren, who won a senate seat in the
state of Massachusetts, has a record of
ﬁghting for the middle class. She prompted
the creation of the Consumer Financial

Protection Bureau and then served as its

inaugural director. She has a long history

as an established legal scholar at Harvard, .

where she has published numerous books
on public and private debt and the predato-
ry tactics of big business. The U.S. Chamber
of Commerce claims that, “No other can-
didate in 2012 represents a greater threat
to free enterprise than professor Warren.”
She hasproven herself to be a thorn in the
side of big business, and her persistent and

demonstrated defense of the middle class
won her a senate race.
In Missouri, Republican congressman

Todd Akin, infamous for his “legitimate, ,

rape” comment, lost the election to Demo-
crat Claire McCaskill. Baldwin, the ﬁrst
openly gay senate candidate, won a senate
seat in Wisconsin. The ﬁrst Asian—American
woman also won a senate seat in Hawaii.
This pattern of victory for candidates —
whose merit spoke to voters moreso than
their: race, gender or sexual orientation
did —— coupled with the legislative victories
for the legalization of marijuana and mar-
riage equality, demonstrate that the Ameri-
can populace is fed up with the “good ole

A boys club” and antiquated social doctrines.

Americans want people in charge who they
can relate to, who represent their interests
and who will push back against the forces

Iidlooclalrolldu

of big business and discrimination that
are set on exploiting and oppressing the
average American citizen.

In thiselection, Republicanjsupporters
donated more than $800 million to Re-
publican races throughout the country
to little avail. The most important race

was lost — the Senate — and the Repub- T

licans are barely holding on to control in
the House. Even with Citizens United and

T ultra~wealthy donors threatening the ba-

sis of American democracy, this election

proved that merit and qualiﬁcation are still

what the American people value most and

that no matter howmuch money certain

candidates have, if they do not demonstrate
a commitment to the "middle class and to
the needs of marginalized citizens, they
will not win the presidency or any election
in this country. ‘

Former Republican congressman Tom
Davis was quoted in The New York Times
saying: “There just are not enough mid-
dle-aged white guys that we can scrape
together to win. There’s, just not enough
of them.” This country is no longer com‘!
posed of mostly middle—aged, native—born
white men. It is composed of immigrants,
women, gays and lesbians, students and
people of all different ages. Tuesday’s elec~
tions were the ﬁrst time that America’s
traditionally marginalized and minority,
classes were able to demonstrate their
ability to effect change. Tuesday was not
just a victory for Obama and Democratic
candidates, it was a victory for women, the
working class, immigrants, the LGBT com-
munity, students and, most importantly,
for meritocracy. I

After ending a 17-game losing
streak with a narrow two-point
victory over William & Mary on
Sunday, the Pitt women’s basket-
ball team began a winning streak
with a dominant victory on Tuesday
afternoon.

Playing in the Fitzgerald Field
House for the ﬁrst time since 2006,
the Panthers (2-1) used a late ﬁrst-
half surge on Throwback Day to pull
away from Siena College (1-1) and
pick up their second consecutive
victory, defeating the Saints 75-50.

Pitt head coach Agnus Berenato
was pleased with her team’s best
performance of the young season.

“We smacked them,” Coach
Berenato said after the game. “It
was a great win. I’m proud of our
team. We really embraced the Field
House. I loved playing here.”

Junior guard Marquel Davis
echoed her coach’s statement.

5* * “It feels good to win two
straight, and coming to the Fitzger-
ald Field House was a good experi-
ence,” Davis said. “It’s cool playing
in different buildings.”

The two teams went back and
forth early in the game. But Pitt’s
aggressive, attacking style of play
helped the Panthers go on a 17-5 run
midway through the game’s open-
ing half, as Berenato’s bunch took
a 39-26 lead into the break.

Unlike the second half of the

‘Panthers’ season opener against

Youngstown State, Pitt didn’t let
up, extending the lead to put the
result beyond doubt. The Saints
never got within 13 in the second
half, and the Panthers opened up

.:. a lead of 30 points with about nine

minutes remaining.

junior forward Asia Logan car-
ried the Panthers to triumph over
William 8: Mary with 36 points and
14 rebounds, but Pitt used a much

7more balanced offensive attack

‘against Siena to notch another win.
Four Panthers — Logan, Davis,
sophomore guard Brianna Kiesel
and junior guard Ashlee Ander-
son — scored in double ﬁgures,
while freshman guard Loliya Briggs

« added eight points.

Kiesel enjoyed playing an im-
portant role in such an impressive
team victory.

“We love when we’re all scor-

ing,” the talented sophomore guard
said. “It makes the game more fun.”
Kiesel ﬁnished with 14 points, ﬁve
assists and two rebounds.

Coach Berenato was impressed
with the way her point guard dic-
tated the pace of the game.

“She was the glue to us today,”
Berenato said of Kiesel.

On the defensive end, the Pan-
thers played their best game of the

season, holding the Saints to just 50
points after allowing Youngstown
State and William & Mary to tally 64
and 74 points, respectively.

Coach Berenato emphasized the
importance of the Panthers holding
Siena to the relatively low score.

“We had a goal: not giving Siena
[more than] 50 points,” she said,
pleased that her team achieved that
objective.

After playing three games in ﬁve
days to begin the season, the Pitt
women’s basketball team will now

have a week off before the Panthers .

look to extend their winning streak‘
to three games when they host Wag-
ner College next Tuesday at 7 p.m.

“We want to make sure we come
out hungry,” Kiesel said about the
possibility of building a longer win-
ning streak. I

slash to the hoop. —
But Lehigh —— a team familiar with caus-
ing upsets after it famously stunned No.

2-seed Duke in last season’s NCAA Touma- .

ment —— quickly battled back with the help of
star senior guard C.]. McCollum, who, along
with Pitt’s freshman center Steven Adams,
drew more than a dozen NBA scouts to the
Pete for the contest.

The two signature moments of the first
half both came from the two legitimate fu-
ture professionals on the court.

First, McCollum drained a deep 3—pointer,
turned to Pitt’s student section — the Oak-
land Zoo —- and put his pointer ﬁnger to
his lips, suggesting that the rowdy students
should quiet down. But Adams got Pitt fans
on their feet when he swatted a shot attempt
into the seats, recording his ﬁrst block of
the game.

Collum said.

_ahead ofitlllii-l‘—,1.i\;/Tountain Hawks, 35-30. .

Pitt extended that lead after the break
thanks to the star of the game — and it
wasn’t the solid Adams or the relatively
quiet McCollum.

After leading the team with 11 ﬁrst—ha1f
points, junior forward Talib Zanna scored
the Panthers’ ﬁrst seven points of the second
period, helping to quickly turn what was a
close game into a lopsided affair.

“He works extremely hard,” Dixon said
of Zanna. “In some ways, he’s kept his game
simpler. He’s doing what he does well. We’ve
always known he was going to be a very good

. player.”

Thanks in large part to Zanna, who ﬁn-.34

‘ ished with 20 points and six rebounds, Pitt

went on a 14-2 run early in the second half

V as the Panthers began to pull away. '

With second 20-point game of the
young season, Zanna has displayed an im-
proved offensive game and a reﬁned mid-

“I worked on that a lot this summer in

M the gym,” Zanna said when asked speciﬁ-

cally about his jump shot.

‘ Pitt’sother star performer of the eve-
ning, Tray Woodall, stated that the Panthers.
played an aggressive style of basketball to
break the game open. . i

“I think we came out with a lot of ﬁre
[in the second half],” he said. “We didn’t

‘ want to settle.”

Dixon liked how Woodall displayed lead-
ership by dictating the pace of the game.

“He’s running the offense," the Pitt head
coach said of his senior point guard. “It

— starts with his intensity and commitment.
, I think he did a good j ob of driving and not

settling for [3—pointers]. He got in the lane
a lot and made some good decisions.”

Woodall ﬁnished with 23 points, eight
assists and four rebounds to lead another
efﬁcient outing from the Pitt offense.

Pitt essentially won the game because
of its domination in two crucial statisti-
cal categories: rebounds and assists. The
Panthers ﬁnished with 38 boards and 17
helpers, while the Mountain Hawks tallied
only 22 rebounds and ﬁve assists.

Looking to extend its winning streak to
six games — starting back in last season
— Pitt will welcome the Oakland Grizzlies
to the Petersen Events Center on Satur-
day, Nov. 17 at 7 p.m. before traveling to
the Big Apple to face the Wolverines next
Wednesday.

Coach Dixon now wants to make sure
his team doesn’t overlook the Grizzlies,
as the marquee matchup with Michigan
draws closer.

“We’ll have Thursday and Friday to pre-
pare for Oakland, and I think we’ll be ready
to go Saturday. That [Michigan] game is
eight days away,” he said. 3
