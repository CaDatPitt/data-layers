Fraternities
Extend Bids
To 101 Men
137, Invitations ‘Registered;
Rushees Interviewed by

Biddle This Week

_—:.1——.—--—

Estimate 40 Acceptances

 

After a seven-day rushing period of
men’s campus social fraternities
ending at 2 o’clock Sunday morning,
a total of 137 bids were registered
with Mr. Theodore Biddle, assistant
to the dean of men, yesterday for
101 new and advanced freshman, up-
perclassmen, and transfers.

Rushing this semester was a far
cry from the ‘hectic whirlwind
splurge of events that marked the
period last semester. Although the
number of events-was not ﬁxed at
any set limit the'- fraternities as a
wllole depended upon a few well
planned and impressive theater, bowl-
ling, and bridge parties, and a Series
of smokers to inﬂuence rushees- to
become members. A ruling by the of-
ﬁce of the dean of men, permitted
dances to take place only on Friday
and Saturday nights and on the eve
of Washington’s -birthday, . but, at
that, the majority of the social or-
ganizations did not conduct dances
on all three nights allowed.

Throughout yesterday after the
bids were registered in the office of
the dean of men, Mr. Biddle inter-
viewed biddees, on their attitudes to-
ward the fraternities which have bid
them. He will continue this ques-
tioning through today and tomorrow
until all bids have been answered.

Tomorrow afternoon at 5 o’clock,
the fraternities will be notiﬁed as to
which bids have been accepted, and
accepting rushees will be taken to
the houses of the fraternities which
they have signiﬁed intention of join-
ing and will be officially pledged.

A total of 137 .bids this semester is
slightly under the number submitted
this time last year when 169 invita-
tions were registered for 129 men.
About 50 men accepted and pledged
after second semester rushing last
year, a ﬁgure which is ten less than
the number of men according to an
estimate of Mr. Biddle, who will be
pledged tomorrow.

Visiting Dean
Speaks Friday

Dr. Henry Van Dusen Talks
at Student Assembly

 

 

“Ventures in Belief for a Skeptical
Generation” is the subject Dr. Henry
P. Van Dusen will discuss at a spe-
cial student assembly at Memorial
Hall on Friday, starting at 12:30
o’clock,

Dr. Van Dusen will attempt to out-
line present day dilemmas and their
effect upon mental conditions of col-
lege students. His mission, he ex-
plains, is to develop a working philo-
sophy of life—one that is in every
respect practical for lifting students
out of their _mental ruts.

Dean of Students at Union Theo-
logical Seminary, a graduate of
Princeton University, and graduate
student at the University of_Edlnbo1'o
and Union Theological Seminary, Dr.
Van Dusen has maintained‘. constant
contact with college‘ students and is in
position to know about what he is
talking. He is the author‘ of “In
quest of Li__fe’s Meaning” and the edi-
tor of “Ventures in Be1ief.”'

Aside from being hailed as one ‘of
the youngest and most brilliant III-
terpreters of student life, heis recog-
nized as a clear thinker along all
lines of work and a forceful speaker.
All his speeches are V impromptu,
without preparation.

The student assembly is planned in
accordance with the policy of the YM
and YWCA’s to present at least once
a year a religious forum with some
outstanding theologian to the campus
at large. Mr. W. W. Mendenhall,
executive secretary of the YM.CA, per-
suaded Dr. Van Dusen to stop off in
Pittsburgh long enough to talk on Fri-
day when he will be traveling to
Bethany College to lead discussion at
a religious convention there. ‘

Necessary, ,Says
Haliburton

Richard Haliburton, who has
swum-through the Panama Canal,
who has climbed mythical Mount
Olympus, and who has followed
the trail of Ulysses through the
Mediterranean strongly favors a
college education.

Separated from ' the “madding
crowd” for a moment, the Univer-
sity-trained world traveler gave
college education a boost when he
declared, “The background and
culture of my university educa-
tion was as important in appreci-
ating my travel as my travel was
in "understanding my education.”

Haliburton, tall, good looking,
often refers to his adventures as
he talks. He remembers the
white queen he found in an East
Indian island as well as the swirl-,
ing waters of the Hellespont.
But he still maintains, ill effect,
that the royal road to romance
will best be found by taking ﬁrst

.a good college education.

large a percentage of those helpedin

“In a number of cases, students

‘one-Act Play lpzans For Czechoslovakian

Cathedral Class Room A rrive

 

In the midst of student enthusiasm
and spirited endeavor in sharing work
to raise money for Cathedral nation-
ality rooms by sponsoring the Mardi
Gras Ball, arrive the plans for the
Czechoslovakian room. Mrs.‘ Ruth
Crawford Mitchell, adviser to nation-
ality groups, has just received from
the architect, Dr, Bohumil Slama in
Prague, the colorful designs for the
new room.

The architect was obtained through
the efforts of the Prague committee
on the Cathedral Czechoslovakian
class room. This committee boasts
among its members many prominent
people in Prague including Dr. Alice
Masyrk, daughter of the president.
This may account for the ﬁne'co-
operation between the two committees
the American and Czechoslovak, in
working out this project, '

While including elements represent-
ing the traditional and cultural
aspects of Czechoslovak life, this lec-
ture room in general reﬂects the char-
acter of the agrarian section—the
peasant. -

The heavy wooden-beamed ceiling,
as commonly used in peasant homes,
intricately carved and colored sup-
porting columns on either side of bay
window, well constructed wooden
window ‘benches,-..,. besides planked
ﬂooring and a heavy platform for the
professor's desk—transmit to us the
sturdy qualities of the peasant.

Czechoslovak love of brightness and
color is manifested in red frieze of
Moravian Slovak design and base of
blue and red encircling the bottom of
gleaming white walls.

The most classical national Slovak
ornament, a free hand painting of a
conventionalized “Tree of Life" will
hang on the rear wall in its striking
colors of blue, rose, yellow, and green.
Such ﬂoral designs are painted every

Five Records
Surpassed ln
ndoor Meet

First Annual Indoor ‘Champion-
ships See Three Track, Two
Field Records Fall

Fleming Is High Scorer

Ripping ﬁve marks from the recog-

nized list of indoor records, the first
annual indoor championships to be
-run off since 1925 were brought to a
successful close Saturday afternoon
in the Track House.

Three track records-—the 2-lap, 440
and 880-yard dash—and two ﬁeld rec-
ords—the shot put and pole vault—
were. eclipsed during the three-hour
program which saw the athletes,
urged on by their brothers on the side
‘lines, hotly contest the validity of
every one of the 25 University track
marks.

The 440-yard dash mark was the
ﬁrst to go with Bill Keller taking off
two seconds from the joint mark held
by Shea and Martin. since 1924. In
the 2-lap event Keller repeated his
record breaking performance, beating
Pete Bowen's mark by almost that
much time.

Jim Watkins surpassed Howell's
record in the 880-yard event to com-
plete the track record breaking times.

While the tracksters were hitting
at the dash records, Pelucha and
Bonavita. were hammering at the old-
time ﬁeld records.
Pelucha topped the bar at 12 feet 8
inches, a. record by more than 5
inches .higher. than that set by- Ro-
busch in 1924. Bonavita tossed the
shot over 44 feet to top Thornton's
record by almost 4 feet.

A race for the individual high
score of the afternoon developed be-
tween Linwood Theissen and Arveil
Fleming. Collecting three ﬁrst places
against two ﬁrsts, and a s-econd place,
Fleming was crowned individual high
scorer of the afternoon.

Performances by McMunn, Good,
Musico, Connelly and Scott were out-
standing in the freshman events.

The summary of the meet follows:

The_ Interfraternity Basketball‘
League is swinging into the third-

round with a number of teams tied
for places and others trying to bet-
ter their standing. In Tuesda.y’s and
Thursday's matches, several groups
temporarily cinched their positions
as the ‘standings showed what teams
will probably lead the league at the
ﬁnish. .

Last Week Alpha Phi Delta won a
close game to tie with the Phi Eps for
ﬁrst place in Section A, while posi-
tions in the other group did not vary

much because no games were played
on Washington’s birthday. The com-;

Pitt Chessmen Top
Local Board Club

In Season Upset

 

Playing an eight board match Pitt’s
chess men scored the outstanding up-
set of the season last Tuesday when
they defeated the Pittsburgh Chess
Club by the score of 41,4 to 3%.
Pre-match sentiment overwhelm-
ingly favored the Downtown business
men’s organization, who have been
recognized as leaders among the
chessmen- of. .the._.-Pittsburgh district.
The group from town had previously
split two games with the YMHA who
had won over Pitt at their last meet-
ing.

Robert McClurkin, playing the No. 3
board, tied his match against the only
woman who participated in the tour-
nament, Miss Chambers, of the Pitts-
burgh Chess Club, Erdeky, of the
downtowners, playing Nos. 1 and 4
boards simultaneously, was beaten by
Roger Ilsley, Pitt No. 1, and in turn
defeated Benjamin Coretz, Pitt No. 4.
Bradford Ilsley won over Stein in the
number two match of the tournament
and C. William Phillips, board No. 6,
won his match from Josse as did
Waldo Steiner, No, 5. The members
of the Pitt team in the order of play-
ing is as follows: Roger Ilsley, Brad-

Hoya-Middie

Floor Series

 

Lose First Eastern League
Game, 28-27; Trip Mid-
shipmen, 3|-29

Carlson Changes Lineup

 

Dr. Carlson and his Panther cagers
divided their double eastern bill of
the week-end, losing to Georgetown
U. Friday evening, their ﬁrst Eastern
League defeat in ﬁve games, and de-
feating the Annapolis Midshipmen
Saturday afternoon in a surprise vic-
tory. ‘

"Because of the eligibility of two of
his stars, Cribbs and Wainio, Dr. Carl-
son had to shift his lineup for the
Hoya game, which brought unexpect-
ed results.

Georgetown held the lead at the end

of the ﬁrst half, 16-15, but the Pan-
thers came from behind‘ at the begin-
ning of the "second half, soon holding
a 22-16 advantage. With three sec-
onds to go, Pitt held a 27-26 advan-
tage, -but Crowley’s ‘shot fro'm‘= center
of the ﬂoor spelled defeat for the
Panthers.
The Friday night defeat was some-
what dissipated when the Panthers
became the cause of the second de-
feat this year of the Middies on their
own ﬂoor.

Carlson started his second string

‘outﬁt against the future ship com-

manders. The subs held off the Tars
during 12 minutes of play of the ﬁrst
half, and when they left the ﬂoor the
score stood 13-8 in favor of the mid-
dies. 2

A second period spurt and the bot-
tling up of Loughlin, Middie scoring

' ace who had collected 12 points dur-

ing the ﬁrst period to bring his total
of 215 points for 15 games, gave the
Panthers their scoring opportunities.
Ochsenhirt, at center, proved the
spark plug that turned the tide in
favor of the Panthers. He scored

Presto!

THE PITT NEWS

from ﬂoor immediately after the
opening of the second half, and a few
minutes later got another double-
decker to put his team in front at 21
to 19.

The battle then was being waged
ﬁercely. Navy took a two-point lead,
only for VV. Hughes to come through
for Pitt and knot the count at 23.
The Tars then picked up two more
points to Pitt’s one, a.nd it remained
for Ochsenhirt. to account for his
third goal and- start the ﬁnal rally
that spelled victory for Pitt.

EXPLANATION :

“Disappearing” acts are among the most popu-
lar in the repertory of the magician. Dogs,
horses, girls, whole rooms disappear—whisked
into wings, dropped through trapdoors, hidden
by mirrors. But this “disappearance” is a bit

telegraphic vmatchos. The biggest
blow to the team was their defeat by
Carnegie Tech in the second National
Riﬂe Association meet of the year.
Tech beat them 1331 to 1371 and nulli-
ﬂed the advantage Pitt had gained by
winning over Fenn College, their ﬁrst
NRA opponent, 1327 to 1227.

Pitt shot against St. Johns Athletic
Association, University of Pennsylva-
nia, University of Minnesota, Gettys-
burg University, and North Carolina

of telegraphic meets with military
teams throughout the country. A

marked up a high 3672 which was just
good enough to beat the Texas Aggies
out ' by one point, 3672 to 3671.
Lafayette University, Oklahoma A. &
M., and Lehigh University prove all
easy matches for the riﬂers. Lafay-
ette and Oklahoma A, & M. ran a

Oi-Ticials Attempt to Popularize
New Telegraphic Meets

 

The recent ,ac_cep_tance of ,,Bryn
Mawr makes a. total of four schools,
besides Pitt, which will participate in
the second Eastern Telegraphic Swim-
ming Meet, sponsored by the WAA
here. The Pitt officials are attempting
to spread this form of aquatic compe-
tition throughout the country and are
hoping that this meet will inspire
others of its kind.

Pitt extended invitations to thirty-
three other schools, -but, because of
ful schedules, differences in the size
of pools, and lack in some schools of
competitive swimming, most of the in-
yitations were refused. In last year's
meet, Pitt scored 29 points to win.

Events in each school of the contest,
which will take place some time in
March, must be run oﬁ within an hour.
The results of competin-g schools must
be sent in to -the University here by
April 10. A 40-yard crawl, a 40-yard
back crawl, a 40-yard breaststroke,
and a. 100—yard free style, will com-
prise the events. .

All contestants must be undergrad-
uates, entering not more than two
events each. Thateam must not ex-
ceed 12 members.

In cooperation with the WAA East-
ern Telegraphic Swim Meet, an hon-
orary swimming team has been form-
ed by Mrs. Frances Tracy of the phy-
sical education department. The new
organization is to have regular swim-
ming practices to perfect strokes,

diving and speed.

Fighting to the accompaniment of

quite a scare into the Middie ranks.

The Panthers were only able to win‘

Pitt had no heavyweight, the ﬁnal
score read 6-2 in favor of the Mid-

In the 125 pound class, Gambatese,

Jimmy Giannatti gave the Panthers
their ﬁrst victory by shading Mid-

all stages, with Giannatti’s cleaner
punching winning him the decision.

Bernie Spiegel lost a close decision

I Death slowlymoves Johnny Luch to take‘ his ‘place among

the athletes of-Eternity.

There remains this morning in the locker room of the
Stadium an empty, gaping locker to mark his passing. In
the throats of teammates and those who were close to
Johnny Luch or came in contact with him during class
hours on the campus, watched ‘him on the practice ﬁelds,
and saw him carry the Blue and Gold on the competitive
ﬁelds of this campus and those of other Universities, there
comes a tightening when the conversation turns to the sub-
ject of his sad passing. But time will smooth over the hurt
of his going, ﬁll the void he leaves, and another will take his
place. In time, too, that locker will be the storing place for

another ’s equipment.

But Time cannot erase from the achives of memory his
position as one of the best loved athletes at the University.
His quiet smile, cheery greeting, and willingness to labor on

the athletic ﬁelds won him that position among his team-
mates who will bear him to his last resting place, and those

who stood aside and watched.

To you, Johnny Luch there

can be no better tribute than to say: “\Vell done, good and

faithful servant. ’ ’

Another Year

T

ODAY marks the 146th birthday of the University of Pittsburgh.
From a single-roomed school house through a period of enlarge-

ment, climaxed with the erection of a towering skyscraper on its

campus, is the history of the University during that time.

Through

that 146 years many thousands of students have appeared at its
doors to seek a traininggtliat would, at its end, better ﬁt them for

their chosen professions. ..  

‘Some of those years have been happy ones in the life of the Uni-
versity; some have been sad. But with each succeeding birthday,
more and more students have become associated with its traditions

and ideals.

Through that time many thousands of students have

wended their .way to offices to incorporate in their business the
training received while one of its undergraduates; thousands have
become teachers, instructors, and heads of schools—academies, col-
leges, and universities—to teach. as they had been taught; others
have found themselves ﬁghting or cajoling Nature and her forces
into becoming a more docile servant of man with the weapons which
had been placed in their hands at the University. Some have praised
the training the University had given them; some have sorrowed at
its seeming lack. For some the struggle through the four years has
been an almost overwhelming one; to some the passage of the four
years on the campus has been ﬁlled with pleasure and ease.

Through all these years the University has accepted all as they
came to prepare themselves for their future after graduation, and
now it stands after these 146 years, a living monument to a success-
ful venture on the part of those who foresaw, those many years be-
fore, its necessity inthe lives of those who would better equip them-
selves for the pursuits of their professions and practices.

Now the University stands on the threshold of its 146th birth-
day, still young, still beckoning and inviting, still a successful ven-
ture for those who would have it so. With the more urgent need of
University training Pitt will continue to stand, for its graduates
have given the University a successful heritage; because the Univer-
sity has given its graduates the best equipment for the ‘gaining of

CREAM OF THE

John A. Lomax, lecturer on cow
boy ballads, tells an interesting story
about his trip to Vassar. While he
was talking to the President, a girl
asked if she could speak with him in

private; he consented, She led him
to a room where eight ._other girls
greeted him with: “We understand,

Mr, Lomax, that you 1_iave.. two sets of

lectures, one for mixed audiences,
and one for male audiences. ’ We
don’t believe that such a distinction
is just, and have-met to ask you to
give us your lecture for male audi-
ences." ' ‘

A columnist at Haverford rec.-

words for the well known song:
“He’s got a soft spot for dear old
Wellesley,
He’s got a daisy up at Vassar,
too; _
He corresponds with a gal. at
. Radcliffe .
And Bryn Mawr believes him
' true. I

He’s well known at both Smith
and Barnard,
For N. J. C. he's got a ready
eye;
He’s» got a coed at every college,
He’s just an all-American guy.”

At last a positive beneﬁt of the de-
pression has been found. No official

With the return of the Pitt grid-
ders from the sunny climes of South-
ern California, came tall stories about
the good times the boys had with the
Trojans, with the movie stars, and
with the etc., etc. But the best of all
the current rumors is the one about
Jimmy “Schnozzle” Durante and the
“Pride of -the Pitt Proboscises” (or
is it Probosces?) It all happened
while the boys were visitng the stu-
dio where “Schnozzle” and Buster
Keatonwere making their last, “What
Price Beer?” Some of the gridders
had been boasting about the size of
the nasal extermities of Dick Matesic
and Mike Nicksick. When “Schnoz-
zle” Was introduced -to the boy-s, he
took the two aforementioned aside
and said, “Well, fellows, what they
said ‘is the truth, We’re the only three
men inthe United States who can-
smoke, a cigar i.n_th,_e rain.”

Looking Out

...ByW.F.A....

0'0  .O

After March 4th, the real battles-in-Congress of the depression
are going to be fought. And the best battle of them all, the one that
is going to make the squabbles over the R. F. C., the Home Loan
Bank, and the 18th Amendment look like a fudge party tiff at
Wellesley, is going to be the one o_ver inﬂation.

This_ba_tt1e, is going to be taken seriously. It will be a serious
matter toﬁghters in both corners of the ring. Looking at the ques-

tion of currency inﬂation as it ap-O

pears now, it_ seems to me that the
anti-inﬂationists have been pushed into
a. defensive position, leaving to the
inﬂationists the opportunity to do all
the leading. This is natural. Those
who propose a change in the currency
are proposing an adjustment that
suits the deﬂated values of these
years of depression. The defenders
of the gold standard make no con-
cessions to deﬂation; in fact, ‘they
propose that we simply wait, hoping
that if we deﬂate enough, everything
will once again be 1928 milk and

honey.
What Happens -

But in the meantime? Before de-
ﬂation is complete, the crash con-
tinues its din, as it has since stock
values dropped in Wall Street one Oc-
tober day three years ago. _

Financiers, wise to the powerful
movement toward inﬂation "iii" the
agricultui'al districts of the United
States, have -instituted a voluntary
moratorium on farm moi:tgages'. But
at best this can brin'g.onl‘y temporary
relief; further it brings no lowering
in capitalization, which to all appear-
ancesis i_nevita:ble; and ﬁnally, this
moratorium has reached‘ only a small
portion of the indebted ‘farm popula-
ti°1.1-. . .- :" I -

‘As "anyone who remembers the
tragi-comic llistory of the t-‘twenties,
knows, most,‘ if not all, .of the I1'1V,()'.l"_l‘.-,
gages on ‘farm property shouldnéver
have been written. Other industries
recovered from the depression of 1921
(it ._ seems like a. midget now), but
agriculture, bumping along on low
prices, did not. And rather than rem-
edy a situation, whose key was an uii-
adjusted price level, the farmer, often
with government encouragement, pro-
ceeded to write himself into debt up
to the neck. That mortgage orgy is
now yielding a ﬁne crop of fore-
closures, revolts, and frightened sher-
iffs. As matters stand now, the total
farm indebtedness of the United
States is a little less than ten billion
dollars, or about ‘three and one-half
times the annual expenses of the fed-
eral government. Taking the Na-
tional Industrial Conference Board’s
estimate of 25 per cent as the portion
of our population engaged’ in agricul-
ture, the per capita indebtedness of
the farm population is about $300.
This ﬁgure tells little, for it includes
those fortunate, debt-free individuals-.
In Iowa, for instailce, where olie-third
of the rural property values are mort-
gaged, tlie per capita (both farm and
city dwellers) indebtedness is $445,
making the per capita indebtedness
of the farm population alone even
higher. v

Poor Man’s Remedy

The farmer and the man whose
prosperity depends‘ on that of the
farmer naturally turn to inﬂation as a
remedy. Aside from its possibilities
as a stimulantlto a, dead horse econ-
omy, they see it as a means of giving
them a. fair adjustment on debts made
during the late boom. They have no
great desire; to pay in dollars worth a
dollar and one-half a debt made in
dollars worth only a. dollar. And the
justness of their argument can hardly
be denied.

But the same argument can be
pleaded for all debtors. They ﬁnd
burden enough
without adding some ﬁfty per cent to
the capital as has been the case in
many existing obligations a.s the re-
sult of a ﬁfty per cent increase in the
real value of the dollar. Little
debtors are not the only ones affected.
Corporations, whose bonds are falling
due, and ba.nks, whose assets are
frozen or, in part, wiped out, ﬁnd the
inelastic dollar a superirritant on a
business situation that is already
painful enough. There is a great deal
of talk about the awful fears of big

business men and bankers on the mat-
ter of inﬂation. I sometimes wonder
if there are not. a, good many. of _them
who would welcome inﬂation as a
way -out of debts which they can
never‘ hope to meet under existing
conditions. . -
inflation Fears

What the business leaders fear, of
course, is an uncontrolled deprecia-
tion of the currency that will roll
down hill until there is a. grand smash
up. But they must surely be con-
scious of a similar movement now
under way whose prospects are equal-
ly dangerous. 4 The evil circle of inﬂa-
tion is no more real than is the evil
circle of deﬂation. ».As-prices fall,
banks .ﬁnd it necessary to dump col-
lateral holdings upon the open mar-
ket, and holders of mortgages must
foreclose and sell. Prices are driven
down further. More and more assets
are pushed on the. market, depressing
prices as everyone tries to get out
from under. According to all theories,
deﬂation. stops some time. But we
have seen its steady eﬁect since the
beginning of the depression without
anysign of abatement, in spite of the
occasional cheery statements. from
Charles M. Scliwab. At the present
rate, debtors will lose all they have,
anid_——creditors willhe left holding as-
sets that are worth nothing. If you
allow deﬂation to continue, we may
get economic recovery. But we are
also going to -get a shift in property
ownership that will emphasize more
than ever._ thedifferences between the
propertied and «propertyless eclasses.
.. If they. refuse to. inﬂate the currency,
will _business leaders give their con-
sent toa stoppage of the deadly deﬂa-
tion--now in progress? Perhaps it
would ‘be wiser to ask, can they stop
the deﬂation? Perhaps the business
leaders are asking themselves, as
many of us are, can anybody do any-
thing any more?

Rohrbach Cites Education
Needs Before Legislators

Dr. Q. A. Rohrbach, professor of
education, appearing before the Joint
Committee on Education of the Senate
and House of Representatives of the
State legislature, spoke on “Needed
Changes in the Proposed School Code
for Pennsylvania.’’

Dr, Rohrbach’s talk was for the
most part concerned with the ﬁnancial
arrangements now in effect in school
administration. The main points
covered in his address had to do with
the ﬁnancing of schools and Edmond’s
Law of teachers salaries. After his
address he answered questions raised
by the legislators.

Dr, Rohrbach is an authority on
school administration.‘ A member of
the State committee on school admin-
istration, Dr_ Rohrbach has been in-
timately connected with the problems
of Pennsylvania's schools.

IGHT-THIRTY P. M. is the time to telephone

The day’s rush is over; the night’s still young. There’s''

plenty of time for a newsy, intimate chat. The fam-

ily’s at home, eager to hear your voice. (They’ll be

there for sure if you telephone as a regular habit, the

same time each week.)

What is more, it is cheapest to telephone after 8:30’
P. M. That is when the low Night Rates go into effect

on Station to Station calls. For 4-Sc you can then call

as far as 140 miles away!

Yes, it’s surprisingly inexpensive, as these typical

rates show. But be sure you make a Station to Station

call. Just give your

home telephone number to the‘

operator and hold the line. If you like, the charges-

can be reversed.
