Dr. Sutherland To Sponsor
Football Clinic Tomorrow

Noted C o a c h To Speak,
Practical Exhibitions
To Feature Affair

 

Tomorrow one of the largest ath-
letic events ever SD011S01‘e<1 by the
University will take place: D11 John
B. Sutherla.nd’s third annual football
clinic. More than 250 high schools
from Pennsylvania, New York, Dela-
ware, New Jersey, West Virginia, and
Ohio have accepted invitations. In
spite of the fact that each high school
coach has been requested to bring
only his assistant and two football
players, the attendance will probably
exceed 1000.

The program will start at 9 o’clock
tomorrow morning in the Stadium
with practical exhibitions and demon-
stratjons by the Panther football
squad. From 9 until 10:30 o’clock the
demonstrations Will be chieﬂy C071‘
cerned with the offensive and de-
fensive techniques of line play. FY0111
10:30 to 12 o’clock the ends and back-
ﬁeld players will put on demonstra-
tions which will complete the morn-
ing program.

At 12:15 the group will move down
to Vvebster Hall for luncheon and
talks on football by some outstanding
football caches. Lou Little, head
coach at Columbia university and a
sound football technician, will ta.lk on
“Deception.” Eddie Casey, head foot-
ball coach at Harvard, will discuss
“Forward Passing.” Dr. Sutherland
will discuss “Linemen In Interference
and Some Phases of the Defense
used Against Single and Double Wing-
back Formations.”

Inasmuch as it is primarily a
clinic for high school coaches, one of
the outstanding high school coaches
in the country, Paul Jenkins, from
Ashland high school, Ashland, Ken-
tucky, will discuss “High School
Problems.” Jenkins has been turn-
ing out championship scholastic
teams. His record shows but one loss
in 68 games, His teams have never
lost a game to any other football
team in the state of Kentucky,

After the discussions the clinic will
meet in the Stadium for more exhibi-
tions and discussions which will start
at 2 o’clock. The program has been
so arranged to keep the exhibitions
and demonstrations going on con-
tinuously, in order to avoid the waste
of time.

Dr. Sutherland believes that
“practical demonstrations and exhibi-
tions is a far better method of pre-
senting football lessons than the
blackboard method, which is usually
used at football clinics.” He also de-
clares, “The game of football in all
of its phases is going to be complete-
ly dissected in order to present the
techniques of the game more clearly.”

The University coaches will take
charge of the various units of dem-
onstration. Bill Kern, assistant coach
will take charge of tackle exhibitions;
Vvalter Milligaii, guards; Howard
O’Dell, backs; Ralph Daugherty, cen-
ters; Dr, Roscoe Gougler, backs; and
Edward Hirshberg, ends._

Editors Come Back Alive

From Kentucky Convention

 

By Ron
Those seven men whom observing
students may have observed roaming
around campus with that look in their

eyes happen to comprise the Pitt
News delegation back from four days
in Kentucky's Bluegrass region.

Former editor and business man-
ager, John D. Paulus and David Im-
merman, new editor and business
manager, Jack Tibby and Ellis Tump-
son, sports editor, Robert Badger,
copy editor, Edwin Banks, and assist-
ant campus editor, Charles Byron
Holstein, along with Professor VVil-
liam S. Maulsby left last Wednesday
for the annual National Collegiate
Press Association convention at the
University of Kentucky in Lexingwll
with a sheaf of newspapers. afew dol-
lars in their jeans, and two_ cars.
They returned Sunday night with the
two cars, _

Kentucky, according to the natives,
is noted for its fast horses, beautiful
women, and good liquor. Letting the
last named slip for the nonce, the
delegates can solemnly affirm the ex-
istence of the former two.

At the convention itself, Professor
M-aulsby was one of the ‘most 1II1D0I‘l1'
ant moving forces, regaling represen-
tatives of schools from North and
-South Carolina, Ohio, North Dakota,
Illinois, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, and,
of course, Kentucky, besides sundry
other states, with the low down on
college newspaper nianagemellt

But the entertainment arrange-
ments completely ﬂoored the conven-
tionites. A trip to nearby stables
Thursday afternoon to see old “Man
O’War,” still far from a doddering
relic, dinner at various fraternity
houses, and a smoker that evening at
which Paulus tackled his ﬁrst cigar
with unfortunate results and at which
Tump-son met his dream girl _(who
comprised the dating bureau) ﬁnished
off that day. Friday, the delegates
for a moment thought themselves
back at Pitt, what with coronation
ceremonies for the May Queen, a ﬂoat
parade which Zeta Tau Alpha, dupli-
cating the stunt of its northern chap-
ter, won easily. That afternoon, the
convention went in for a bit of tea
drinking at the home of the President
of the University. And it was here
that the rest of the Pitt men were
able to appreciate just how beautiful
the belles of old Kentucky can look—
and sound. After that there was no
stopping the “Y'all”-ing.

The dance Friday night, was some-
what like our own Spring Festival
dance here the same night, only the
stag line was so long that it stretched
half the 78 miles to Churchill Downs.
At first that p-roved a bit irksonie to
“our boys” who were constantly inter-
rupted in the midst of a “Stardust"
waltz with various campus queens by
a well-modulated “Y’all pahdon me?”

Perhaps the keystone of the whole
convention was the fact that it took
place just about the time a local af-
fair down there known as the Derby
was going off—-an event in which one
or two horses run around a track
while a few people look on. The story
of that affair for half of the Pitt men
and for probably the rest of the dele-
gates,. including Duke Univei's~ity’s
new and real Kentucy Colonel, was a
saga or “Over and Under,” or, “Gladlly
will I pay you ten cents, little boy, to
climb up your ladder over this fence,
and just as gladly will I pay your
younger brother ﬁve cents to crawl
through his tunnel under the inside
fence.” And even if they did see Mae
‘West in a ﬂoppy brown hat and Clark
Gable (he of the ears) and the one 01‘
two horses run around the track at
the Derby, the big thrill remained in
the fact that nigh onto 75,000 pluto-
crats actually paid from $2.20 to $15
to see the thing—whi1e numerous
press delegates, even without press
passes, managed to get right up in
the front line trenches for ﬁfteen
cents.

And now that it’s all over, neither
Badger nor Tmmpson, nor Banks
has written to Kentucky since Sunday
night. Paulus, Tibby, and Immerman,
you see, assumed bachelor roles for
the few days, while Holstein, who was
to be dated with a “tiny brunette
named Elizabeth,” was ﬁnally in-
flicted upon a blond named Ruth,
who happened to be a head taller than
he was—but she was very, very nice,
it seems.

And, oh yes, they couldii’t possibly
leave Lexington without seeing the
most beautiful woman on the Ken-
tucky campus, whom them met at
the Alpha Delta house while collect-
ing their bevy of ZTA’s, Kappa Deltas,
Alpha Xi’s, Kappas, and Thetas for
the evening.

But they had to go all the waY t0

the Bluegrass (which, unfortunately,

does not turn blue until June) to cap-
ture the romance of newspaper work
as extolled by Hollywood scenario
writers.

Letters From Readers

May 7, 1934.
Editor, the Pitt NeWS:
In reading over a pamphlet describ-
ing the Cathedral of Learning, a para-
graph concerning the use of the top

stories caught my eye. The para-
graph reads as follows:
“An observation platform, con-

structed of aluminum, will occupy the
thirty-iiiiith ﬂoor, and there will be
opportunity for carillon chimes, ﬂood
lighting and other ideas suitable for
the top of the building.” _

Various uses for the top stories are
under consideration.

Even before I read this pamphlet,
I thought of an idea to ﬁnish off the
top of the Cathedral. On top of the
Empire State building in New York,
there is a mooring mast for dirigibles.
I am interested in dirigibles and I am
sure there are others who can see
their possibilities both at present and
in the future. Why not construct a
mooring mast with a beacon on top
of the Cathedral of Learning.

I almost hated to bring out this
idea because people sometimes think
we are queer if we suggest anything
out of the ordinary_ For this reason
I refrained from suggesting a moor-
ing mast for the Cathedral until I
saw the paragraph in the pamphlet
that stated that ideas for ﬁnishing
the top of the building are under con-
sideration.

The possibilities of zeppelins for
commercial service was shown when
the Graf Zeppelin circled the globe in
1929 and when it made numerous suc-
cessful ﬂights across the southern At-
lantic Ocean.

Pittsburgh is situated close to
Akron, the lighter-tlian-air center of
the world. Therefore, a dirigible
starting from Akron could moor to the
Pitt mast and take on passengers,
then proceed to the Empire State
mast and take on more passengers be-
fore starting a journey across the sea
to Europe.

The Pitt mast would be more suita-
ble for mooring dirigibles than the
one in New York City because there
are no tall buildings surrounding the
Cathedral to cause disturbing air cur-
rents. Passengers would take the
elevators to the top platform of the
mast and would then walk into the
bow of the zeppelin from a. gang

plank lowered from the nose of the
ship.

Popular subscription or private
funds could be used in constructing
this mast. If I had a million, I would
gladly donate the necessary funds to
build this mast. As it is, I will be
content to add my share to the popu-
lar subscription if such a project is
decided upon.

I hope you will all favor such a plan
and can see how a mast on top of the
Cathedral will not only add to the
beauty of the Cathedral, but will
serve a worthwhile purpose in the
very near future.

W. EDGAR GALBREATH, JR.

Editor, the Pitt News:

We who are the product of small
colleges are prone to think that we
have one advantage which is lacking
in the university, namely, concentra-
tion on the individual, A visit to the
zoology exhibit in the Cathedral of
Learning proved that notion to be a
delusion. Exhibit 26-—-“Methods used
in teaching zoology to the blind”—
was certainly a striking example of
attention focused on the individual.
It is amazing to ﬁnd that a depart-
ment so large and busy has devoted
both the time and thought required
to work out such a method. The ap-
preciation and gratitude of Mr. Gay,
the blind student who presided at the
exhibit, was touching. We laud Dr.
Hance’s efforts as a pioneer in this
work.

There still are, I am told, those
glad souls who believe that at this
time of the year, when tender shoots
of grass along campus walks thicken
in vain endeavor to hide lip—stick
stained cigarette butts, those whose
only claim for distinction is a ques-
tionable ability to put words together
are inspired by the weather to sudden
and furious activity. That's passion-
ate platitude No. 4,371. In other
words, it just isn’t so,

Then too there is the prevalent
idea that in the Spring a young man’s
fancy turns to thoughts of love.
When sulphur and molasses was the
popular means of spring house clean-
ing it was more true than it is now.
Now with scie1ice’s contribution of
concentrated sunlight in brown bot-
tles without even so much as a smell
of ﬁsh oil about it, the mortal frame
15 1958 apt to be as weak as formerly.
However, there are quite a few who
have not learned the secret of health
the year around, and so at this time
of the year the parks are as well
ﬁlled as usual.

But to get back to the ﬁrst point,
about people who try to write. In
general, people who try to write, and
especially the ones who really be-
lieve that they can write, are as a
rule a lazy lot, who lie about and
moan and implore, trusting that their
implorations and moans will by and
by bring forth an inspiration which
in turn will result in a sonnet, a story,
or some bit of writing which they will
sell for a million dollars and then go
to spend the rest of their days in the
paradise of some tropical paradise in
the South Seas. Spring to these peo-
ple means but one thing: that they
can get out in the open under some
shady tree and dream there about the
StI‘e"°*l1 of their pen and the relative
power of a sword. There is one con-
dition of the body that can, fortunate-
ly stimulate such people to sudden
activity. _ That is hunger. No one has
ever estimated how many sonnets
I11a.V be traced directly to lack of
food.

Now this column has not appeared
for some time in the past. That has
been due to a multitude of things,
The primary reason is that like a
number of other college students I'm
essentially lazy. M_,uch water has
passed under bridges, and much type
has been thrown into the “hell box”
since the beginning of the school
year. Then too, it’s such a bore to
bothenreading all my fan mai1_ The
girl friend, the one who could read,

some time that each column would
be my last,
for a 1211118. and then in the event that
a storm of protest greeted by with-

This determination was strengthened
g1'e'°‘~tlY one rainy’ day when a sweet
young thing standing in the doorway
of the Cathedral assured me, on ques-
twlllllg her, that she had read “Be-
tween You, Me, And The Lamp Post”
€Vel‘3' time and that it was invariably
dry and uninteresting. The experi-
ment has not been a success. There
has been no storm of protest, In
fact. I be1ieVe that there has been a
sigh of relief in some quarters.

But all in all we had our triumphs.
There is a red headed sports editor
graduating this year and writing silly
letters at the present time, trying to
set a job, who simply boiled over
when “rusty razor blades” and “spit”
was used in this column_ Conﬁden.
tlallyg he Wipes his silverware on his
napkin in an Oakland restaurant reg-
ularly, and you know what that does
to people who write columns. Then
there was another fellow, more cor-
pulent, whose corpulence, some say,
scarce reached the roots of his hair,
who Went into hysterics regularly for

drivers keep to their own side of the
mad. we will be back in school next
year, and there is the possibility that
by the dint of long pounding some

plinient.

In conclusion, let me say—rusty
razor blades, rusty razor blades, rusty
souls in

what a lot of rot!

 

Seton Hill Honor Banquet

“The Present Status of Education in
Spain,” and “The New Educational
Movement in Italy.” The banquet

took place under the joint sponsor- ..

That I would give it up ~

THE PITT NEWS

By John Hesselbein

Nestled close beside the towering
unfinished Cathedral of Learning that
has been bustling with activity dur-
ing the past several months, the Uni-
versity‘s new Heinz Memorial chapel
has been constantly "on the build”
under the very eyes of students day
after day, with very few of them ap-
;parently realizing it.

VVith construction work postponed
indeﬁnitely on the Cathedral, eyes
suddenly are focused again on the
Evleinorial, which shows remarkable
progress. About 45 workers-—masons,
laborers, and steel workers—liave
been working steadily, and, if con-
tractors are to be believed, all stone
work will be completed by August.

Occupying an immense oval of dust-
laden ground, construction activities
are concentrated at a little building
near Belleﬁeld street, where workers
check in every morning, and where
they come at intervals to drink with
a huge blue dipper from a shining
pail of water. Here are kept all
blueprints for the chapel, and there
are hundreds of them. Here a tele-
phone buzzes, and from here all or-
ders for materials are sent. In a
small corner an old wooden desk sets
with long lines of rubber stamps
hanging beside it on the wall.

And from this location, looking up-

Remarkable Progress Noted
In Memorial Construction

ward, the chapel seems quite large—
so large in fact that you are astound-
ed by it_ Hammers claiigiiig on steel
and the dull ring of wooden mallets
on hard white stone greet your ears,
and inside, out of sight, more ham-
mers pound on wood. The stone work
towers about two—thirds of the way up,
but the contractor states that it is not
even half ﬁnished.

Surrounding the whole building is
a scaffolding, erector-like, made of
many pieces of angle iron, a new
patent devise invented by Alexander

‘Howie, the famous stone contractor.

Far up it towers, like some huge toy
erector scaffolding. On its top level
men walk back and forth wheeling
loads of heavy white stone to the
proper masons. An elevator, part of
the scaffolding itself, carries the ma-
terial up to them from storage houses
on the ground.

On the bare, dry, dust-covered
ground are rusting remnants of the
original ground breaking: an aban-
doned steam shovel mouth, sunken
bricks that made a snowy, mud road
solid. Past them powerful cranes lift
steel and stone, and gasoline-driven
machinery groans with the effort.
More stones, more bricks, more mor-
tar go up. And with them the second
building of the “Quadrangle"——-Heinz
M_emorial cliapel—goes up!

WHY NOT TELEPHONE HOME ONCE EACH WEEK?
REVERSE THE CHARGES IF YOUR FOLKS AGREE.

Even glass insulators behave badly toward tele-
phone currents when humidity is high. This has
been proved by experiments at Bell Telephone

When it’s humid, a ﬁlm of moisture forms on
the glass. The more humid, the thicker the ﬁlm
—and the more electrical current escapes! Im-
portant factors governing amount of leakage are
the chemical nature of the glass, its shape and age,
the amount and kind of dirt on its surface.

Through exhaustive studies, telephone men have

types of glass insulators

—and are seeking ways to make them still better.
Close attention to every detail of Bell System
equipment leads to constantly improving service.

THE PITT NEWS

FRIDAY, MAY 11, 1934

I The Campus Scout

Jimmy Nelson Pinch Hitting

 

Meet Regis Wolff

Regis A. Wolff, coach and captain of the undefeated Pitt golf team, is a
Pittsburgh product. He was born here in 1911 and has received all of his
education in Pittsburgh schools, besides acquiring his knowledge of golf on
district golf courses. Regis entered the University in September, 1930, prior
to that he attended St. Leo's Parochial grade school and Oliver high school.
Like Father, Like Son

Wolff started his golﬁng career early in the capacity of a caddy for his
dad at the age of eleven. His father was quite a golfer then, and even now.
His father has the distinction of being the first American born pro. At the
age of 17 the elder W'olff was a crack professional golfer, however, after three
years in the pro ranks, he withdrew for twenty years to be reinstated as an
amateur in 1920. Regis received his ﬁrst golf instructions from his golf play-
ing father. After this instruction he went out and put it into operation until
1931 when he took several more lessons from Charlie Manning, pro at the
Shannopin country club. Vvolff still regards Manning as one of the ace in-
structors in the Pittsburgh district.

Golﬁng Fame

In the spring of 1929 he organized a four-man team at Oliver high school
and played against a team from Peabody high. It was the ﬁrst interscholastic
golf match in the history of Pittsburgh schools. The sport now takes a prom-
inent part in high school athletics. After graduating from Oliver high he en-
tered his ﬁrst major golf tournaments. In the summer of 1930 he won his
ﬁrst major championship, the Western Pennsylvania Junior, defeating Billy
Marks, now at Princeton, in the ﬁnals 5 and 4. In 1931, as a dark horse
he was a medalist in the West Penn Amateur. ’

Father And Son

Last year Regis and his dad won the Vvest Penn Father and Son Cham-
pionship with a record breaking alternate stroke aggregate of 74 at the Alle-
gheny Country club. Wolff continued winning tournaments throughout the
summer. He won the Nemacolin Invitation Tournament at little Washington,
defeating two top-notch collegiate golfers. He defeated Fred Brand, who was
then the captain of the Penn State golf team in the semi-finals and won the
championship by defeating Bill Kirsh, who was at that time captaining
Swarthmore’s golf team. He qualiﬁed for the 1933 Amateur Championships as
one of ﬁve representing the Tri-State district. Two championships and quali-
fying for the National Amateur in one summer would be enough for a dub, but
not enough for a champion, for Wolff went on winning tournaments and break-
ing pa.rs. Held together with Hoe Roysten, ex—captain of the University of
Michigan’s golf team, he recorded the lowest score of the year on the High-
land course, a 68. In a mixed tournament at the Highland Country club, he
teamed up with Miss Tydol Davies and set a mixed alternate stroke record
with a 77. For the pa.st three years he has been a member of the Highland
Country3(<):lub golf team, that has held the West Penn team championship
since 19 .

Pitt Experiences

Vvolff was the captain of the 1932 Pitt golf team. The record of three
victories and three defeats speaks for itself. However, the highlight of the
year was a victory over Notre Dame. This broke the old Notre,Dame jinx
over Pitt. The Panther football a.nd basketball teams followed with victories
over the Irish that fall. Last year he was ineligible, but managed the team.
He ca.me back this year with a B scholastic average and was made coach and
captain. To date, Coach and Captain Regis Wolﬁ has led the Panther golf
team to six straight victories. The Panthers won the city collegiate golf title
by winning two matches from Duquesne and two from Carnegie Tech. Wolff's
team has also defeated West Virginia and the University of Detroit.

Loses Dual Meet

Slippery Rock Teachers’ School
Wins Over Panthers, 70-55

 

Pitt's “B” track and ﬁeld team took
its bow in the Stadium Tuesday after-
noon and bowed just a bit too stiﬂy.
Slippery Rock Teachers’ college took
advantage of the situation and made
out with a 70-55 victory over the
Panther seconds.

The Pitt chances were hurt con-
siderably by clean sweeps for the
Teachers in the shot-put, discus,
broad-jump, and 100-yard dash events.
VVith the exception of these four
events, the Panthers ap-pear to be
quite formidable and when Coach
Olson uncovers a few new men to
bolster his entry lists, the seconds
should be a strong outﬁt_
