Hip-hop crews
dance to
different styles

Elizabeth Furiga
Staff Writer
Two hip-hop groups on campus have
styles that are worlds apart.

At a class for Controlled Chaos, an in-
structor counts “ﬁve, six, seven, eight”
before the dancers burst into movement
with rhythmic jumps and ﬁnger snaps
complemented by an occasional shimmy
or roll, twisting andjamming to an in-
strumental hip-hop beat. V

At Premium Orange’s rehearsal, club
members practice a boys—versus—girls
“battle” dance routine as Ludacris’
“Stand Up” blasts from a set of speak-
ers. Male and female dancers acted out
a story, depicting a scene of two groups
fighting for the win. Throughout the
showdown, the women pushed the men
off_the stage, and groups of men fake-
whispered in the background while the
women strutted in the foreground. _

The members of Premium Orange,
which just became active this semester,
said they formed the group to ﬁll a gap
for both a dance class and an environ-

at which workers aired their complaints

against the region’s largest employer.
“UPMC should stop ﬁring their work-

First-eve, itt Arts Festival features live performances,

Parthena Moisiadis

Gaurav Gupta—Casale has been active in vol-
unteering_at free Pitt Arts events since his
sophomore year. Now in his senior year,
Gupta- Casale reﬂected on the performances
he has seen through the program during his
time at Pitt. .

“It’s hard to drop that kind of money after
you graduate,” Gupta—Casale said.

Gupta—Casale, who studies politics, phi-
losophy and sociology, was one studentwho
helped host the ﬁrst- ever Pitt Arts Arts Festi-
val, which took place from noon to 5:30 p.m.
at the William Pitt Union on Friday. An esti-
mated 1,000 students attended .the event.

Outside the Union, students who were
walking to and from classes Friday morn-
ing heard the sweet rings of gamelan, or
traditional Indonesian music, resonating
from the William Pitt Union patio.

The instruments played by the Pitt
Gamelan Ensemble, at set metallophones,
xylophones, drums and gongs, caught many
students’ eyes with intricate designs and Pitt
Panthers embellished in gold.

Annabelle Clippinger, director of Pitt
Arts, noted that while the program has
held art fairs in the past, the department
expanded its traditional tabling approach
this year to create a festival experience in-
cluding performances and hands-on activi-
ties for students, all free of charge.

Whilé performers including Pitt’s
Gamelan Ensemble, Cello Fury, Boilermaker
Jazz Band and Pitt Men’s Glee Club took the
stage outside, students also had the oppor-
tunity to visit the Union’s Lower Lounge
for a free lunch of sandwiches and snacks.
While mingling over food, students had the
opportunity to meet representatives from
Pitt’s Cheap Seats and Free Museum Visits
partners.

Lounge, the Kimbo Art Gallery in the Union I
. featured about 20 photographs taken by

members of the Pitt Photography Club. _
On the lawn, students celebrated the day
by posing for-photos in a photobooth. Oth-
ers relaxed in the grass while enjoying the
performances throughout the day. _
Clippinger said that it is important for
Pitt students to take advantage of oppor-
tunities to hear music groups on campus.

“|t’s going to broaden [stuidents’]a

  culture dimension

and give them a

chance to Connect with the city and
the art community.”  
Gaurav Gupta—Casale  

» Clippinger said that these partners,
which are based in the Cultural District, at-
tended the event to reach a younger audi-
ence and to answer student questions about
ticket availability to events such as the ballet,
symphony and opera.

Museums such as the Mattress Factory
and the Andy Warhol Museum offered ac-
tivities'for students, including magnet and
button making. ~ . _

. ' In addition to the activities in the,Lower

“Running Pitt  for so long, I feel it
is important togbe exposed [to the Arts],

because it makes you a better and more com-

plete person. It expands what you khow,”

she said.

Clippinger continued to emphasize how
fortunate Pitt students were to hear the mu-
sic from the featured performers.

4 Gamelan ensembles, she said, are very
rare in American universities, though they

are very common in their native Indonesia.

“It’s really rare. It’s astonishing we have
it,” Clippinger said.‘ ,

Cello Fury, a group of cellists that tours
different cities, was also popular with stu-
dents. The group, composed of three clas-
sically trained cellists, transformed the
traditional sounds of the instrument into
a rock rendition.

“A lot of people like -cellos, but are sur-
prised by what the group is doing with
them,” Clippinger said. _

Megan Ballantyne, a sophomore major-
ing in communication sciences and disor-
ders, said that she enjoyed listening to the
group between classes.

“I didn’t know what to expect, but they
were really impressive,” she said.

Clippinger said thatboth the Boilermaker
Jazz Band, another professional group, and
the Pitt Men’s Glee Club performed with
great amounts of energy. ,

“It’s a fun kind of music that makes you
feel really‘good,” she said ofthe Glee C1ub’s
performance. '

Although Gupta—Casale said that he is d

not musically talented, he said that the per-

. formances he has been to as a result of his

involvement with Pitt Arts have left deep
impressions on him. He encouraged other
students to take advantage of them.

“It’s going to broaden their cultural di— '

mansion and give them a chance to connect
with the city and the art community,” he
said. I

ment for teaching beginners and ac-

comfnodate a different style.
Controlled Chaos, the older of the
two groups, formed in the spring semes-
ter of 2011. According to club president
Cassandra Wozniak, a junior studying
actuarial math, the two students who
formed the group have since graduated.

Each club has a smaller core crew

of experienced dancers who hold sep- O

arate rehearsals, perform in public
more frequently than the rest of the
club and participate‘ in dance compe_-
titions. Also, each group hosts classes
to teach the entire organization, both
crew and non—crew members, a routine
to be performed at a show during the
school year. Premium Orange’s crew in-
cludes ﬁve members, while Controlled
Chaos’ has 10. i

Premium Orange, which will start
holding class this week, plans to meet
each Monday from 7:30 to'9:0o p.m.
Controlled Chaos holds a weekly Thurs-
day class from 7:30 to 8:30 p.m. and
about 30 students attended its "class
Thursday. Both groups hold’ classes in
the Baierl Multipurpose Room. '

“[Our class is] supposed to be more
to help people out one-on—one, and for
people to interact with other dancers,”
Premium Orange vice president Erik

Blumberg said. \
Premium O1;ange uses a nontradi-
tional method of one-on-one instruc-
tion geared toward beginners and those
not yet comfortable with hip-hop.
Controlled Chaos, on the other hand,
uses a more traditional teaching meth-

od, with two core crew members, typi- H

cally the president and vicelpresident-,
stationed in the front to lead the class.

attended the event, which began around
11:00 a.m. in the busy Forbes-Fifth cor-
ridor between the Cathedral of Learning
and the William Pitt Union. The rally ended
at about 12:30 p.m., as protesters began
to march west on Fifth Avenue in the di-
rection of the University Store on Fifth
as Pittsburgh city police oﬂﬁcers diverted
trafﬁc and patrolled nearby on bicycles.
The group Make It Our UPMC organized
the rally, which included a bandstand, a
tented area with food and refreshments
and a live performance by the Pittsburgh-
based Terrance Vaughn Trio. Pennsylvania

Rep. Erin Molchany, D-Mount Washing-

ton, presided over the event, introducing
14 guest speakers, including workers and

. other elected ofﬁcials.

“There are at least seven employees
who have been ﬁred for wearing a pin or
talking with their friends and colleagues
about a union,” District 4 Councilwoman
Natalia’ Rudiak said at the event.

A She said the National Labor Relations
Board’has deemed some of these ex-UPMC
employees’ grievances as legitimate and
claimed that UPMC has used “intimidation
tactics” against workers.

UPMC spokeswoman Gloria Kreps said
the rally unfairly viliﬁed UPMC.

- “We believe that the purpose and intent
of the rally is to divert the public from the
truth, and cast UPMC hospitals — and the
great people who work here every day .—
in the worst possible light,” she said in an
email. “Rallies of this kind demean the
excellent care weprovide to our patients.”_

But Rudiak pointed to UPMC’s recent
affiliation with the National Right to Work
Legal Defense Foundation — which op-

poses compulsory unionization —' as an -

attempt “to.bust these workers.”
The United Food and Commercial

‘Workers. International Union, for which V
Helfer is president of the Local 23'chapter,

was one union that came out Saturday.

Others included the Service Employees-

International Union, Unite Here (aihotel,
food service, laundry and casino-gaming

industry union), the International Broth- ‘

erhood of Electrical Workers and the Unit-

ed Mine Workers Association.
According to Kreps, UPMC provides its

employees with “superior health beneﬁts,

retirement beneﬁts that include both a
deﬁned beneﬁts pension plan and a savings
plan with employer matching contribu-
tions, and generous paid time off.” Kreps
stated that, including these beneﬁts, the
lowest—paid full—time employees earn $21
per hour. T

Linda Mazza and Veronica Smith will

soon be former UPMC transcriptionists.

They pointed out that, while Kreps’
statement regarding compensation and
beneﬁts may be true, full—time workers
were being pushed out. The two women,

who each earn about $17 per hour, were

given the option to quit UPMC or transi-

tion on Sept. 20 to a company that UPMC
has contracted to do its transcription as-
signments. ,
Accordingto Smith, if they choose to
work for the contractor, they’ll be paid by
the number of lines they transcribe, which
would amount to less than the minimum
wage. ~
Additionally, they’d have to pay $79 out
of their paychecks every two weeks for a
Blue Cross Blue Shield health care plan if

they opt to subscribe to their employer’s
health care plan. ’

“So you ﬁgure if you make $650, you
might have about $375 left for two weeks,”
Smith said, estimating what she would take
home after taxes.

While Kreps declined to respond ‘spe-
ciﬁcally to these claims, she stressed that,
in addition to workers’ beneﬁts, UPMC
provides tuition reimbursement for em-
ployees and their dependents who wish to

HIP-HOP

“We like to challenge‘ our members‘
with relatively difficult choreography
because we feel that it is important for

our members to work towards certain’ '

_goals,” Wozniak said. _

Victoria Smith, a member of Pre-
mium Orange, said the group views
hip—hop as a genre with “something
for everyone.’’ The group has a different

choreographer direct class every week
to add variety.

“The perception is, hip—hop is one
thing and_ this is how you do it,”,Smith

said. “A'ri3dwthe reality is,-it’s a very re- '

ative kind of dance because_you,acan

. constantly make new movementséand

put them’ together.” _ Woz-

niak said that part of Controlled Chaos’
mission is to share dance with others.

The group visits other student or-
ganizations -— including at least one
honors society, other dance*organiza-

tions and multicultural sororities -
and performs for the groups, according
to Wozniak.

Controlledlchaos crew member

ing in  studies, said he likes that
the grou.p~.l¥lets him introduce others

further their education. 

V “UPMC’s compensation package far ex-
ceeds what other industries offer,” Kreps
said, “and we continue to provide beneﬁts
most major corporations and governments
are reducing or eliminating.”

Although the rally focused on work-
ers’ rights, many speakers also criticized
UPMC’s status as a nonproﬁt organization,
a status that exempts the company from
paying property taxes. Earlier this year, the
city ﬁled a lawsuit in a Pennsylvania court
challenging UPMC’s tax-exempt status.

Mackenzie Smith (who has no relation
to Veronica) lead organizer for Unite Here
Local 57, said that UPMC’s real—estate hold-
ings total more than $1.5 billion. These
holdings, if taxed, could ‘yield a large
amount of money that would beneﬁt local
schools and transit systems.

“They have so much potential,” she said.
“They give great care, but they need to do
the right thing by this community.” i f

But Syria-sly: Youth ignorance to the
*    Syrian conﬂict

Sophia Al Rasheed
Columnist
“Can we just press pause on Syria?
It’s about to be Fashion Week for
God’s sake.”

Apparently people do actually
make such uneducated remarks
in real life, as the Women’s Humor
Twitter account proved by their
tweet last Thursday morning. Let’s
make one thing clear: This account
absolutely does not represent‘
women and obviously not humor,
either: But I ﬁnd it most interesting
that the same account that tweeted
“nobody ever got laid in ﬂa ” has
any idea of what is actually going
on in Syria, and has any reason to

place a pause on this in the ﬁrst _

place. "My guess is that the more
than 300 users who retweeted
this tweet in particular don’t_have
a pause button to press, either.
Sadly, though, these users rep-
resent only a minuscule fraction

of the people in this country who
are completely blind or ignorant
to what is happening in Syria, or
the implications this interven-
tion could have. There’s no time
to click on the Syriahashtag at the
side of the Twitter homepage ——
it’s trending next to “worst pick
up lines-” -—— but they’ll jump on
an opportunity to post about how
much they love Fashion Week or
how much attention to detail they
gave the Video Music Awards as
the program aired.

We live in a society where it
has somehow become normal to
be blind to global issues —— even
ones that involve the United States.
We’ve collectively decided that it
is perfectly acceptable ‘to have no
knowledge about important mat-
ters, despite the fact that informa-
tion is more readily available to us .
than ever before.

But the blame for this is two-

fold. On one hand we have the news
sources themselves that shy from
exposing foreign issues, aware
of the passive nature usually dis-
played in deciding what news we
choose to hear. The Twitter pages
for major news sources such as The
Hufﬁngton Post, Fox News and
CNN, for example, maintain about
a 1—to-10 ratio regarding foreign-
policy articles and other, less in-
timidating topics. Basically, if you
want to keep yourself informed on
global issues, you have to look for
them yourself.

But then there are the observ-
ers of the world, who collectively
have done very little to combat the '
stereotype that Americans simply
adopt an ignorance-is-bliss atti-
tude regarding foreign policy. If the
facts aren’t spoon-fed to us, many

of us won’t make the effort to learn them
— and the youth are especially guilty of this.

Perhaps the silence and lack of opinion
stems from annoyance with the constant
partisan bickering that ensues in this coun-
try. While the move for military intervention
is backed by both Democrats and Republi-
cans, there are opposing views on whether
intervention will be useful.

Being educated does not require thatyou

get in a heated debate at any given moment
to defend your opinion. It simply means that

A you’ve actually kept up with what is going on

in your country —— perhaps paid half as much
attention to the news as to what is happening
on MTV. We belong to a nation that openly
allows us to question our government and
speak out about the issues that worry us,
which some may honestly not realize is a
privilege that not every country permits.
And we’re executing this power by tweeting
about the worst pickup lines.

Regardless of partisanship, the only ones

who truly fail to render respect are those
who choose to be blind to the subject en-
tirely, especially when it involves something
as crucial as, say, a couple hundred lives at

headlines about Syria, I urge you to at least
understand what’s going on — it really is as
easy as searching for “what is happening in
Syria.” The Washington Post actually had a

stake and over 2 million refugees — half of a blogpost last week called “Nine questions

whom were children. Judging by the U.S.
polls stating that politics is not of value to
young individuals, the decline in youth in-
volvement from the 2008 to 2012 election
and the fact that multiple political science
majors I asked claimed that they “Don’t re-
ally have an opinion” on Syria, there’s a lot
of respect missing. °- ..

WOMEN’S soccnz

D’Agostino, Sharick lead Pitt to 1-

Andrew Stern
Staffwriter

Pitt women’s soccer (4—1—1) defeated To-
ledo 1-0 on Friday evening in the ﬁnal
nonconference contest of the season for

V the Panthers, highlighted by goalie Nicole _

D’Agostino’s fourth shutout of the season.

After the draw at Robert Morris, head
coach Greg Miller was critical of the team’s
shot selection. Yet Pitt sent eight shots to-
ward the Toledo net in the ﬁrst 10 minutes
and shotaa total of 21 times on Friday. The
only goal of the match was tallied by senior
defender Morgan Sharick.

“I don’t think our shot selection was
particularly great againtonight, because
we had only two on goal, especially in the
ﬁrst half when we were taking a lot of shots
from distance,” Miller said afterthe game.
“It’s great to get the shot opportunities, but
we have to be better at giving ourselves a
chance to get a shot on goal.” _ I

Despite the numerous shot attempts, the
Panthers did not have many great opportu-
nities throughout the opening 20 minutes.
And as the lialfwore on, they continued to
dictate play without scoring.

The game looked like it was going to go

SPORTS

into the half tied, until senior Katie Lippert
sent a ball deep into the Rockets’ defensive

zone, leading to a clearance to the side and .

a Pitt corner kick.

T Sophomore midﬁelder Roosa Arvas
launched a perfect ball into the box on the
ensuing corner kick —— a pass that Sharick
was able to head into the back of the net. It
marked Sharick’s ﬁrst goal of the season and

the ﬁfthtime that the defender has scored,

off a corner kick inthe last two seasons.
“I ﬁnally timed one right, and it went in.

I couldn’t tell you how excited I was, it was ‘ l

a tiring ﬁrst half, and we certainly needed
the goal,” Sharick said. _

The Panthers were able to head into
halftime with a slim 1-0 lead while out-
shooting Toledo, 9-1, and absolutely dorni—
nating possession in the ﬁrst 45 minutes
of play. I

Coming out of the break, the Panthers
continued their strong play.

' Just two minutes into the half, Alyssa
Meier advanced past the Toledo backline
‘and sent a scorching shot toward Toledo
goalie Sam Tiongson, who was able to just
barely save the blast.

Following Meier’s chance, the Panthers
continued to surge.

Pitt (0-1-2, 0-1 ACC) lost its ﬁrst AC_C confer—
ence game 1-0 in overtime on Friday eve-

ning to North Carolina State (2-0, 1-0 ACC). _

After hanging tough with the Wolfpack for
the duration of the regulation periods, Pitt
had a momentary slip during overtime that
cost the ‘team a victory.

In the 93rd minute, N.C. State sent a shot ‘

toward the net that looked.to have been
cleared off the line by the Panthers backline.
Playvcontinued before the line judge ruled
that the ball had, indeed, crossed the line.

,The loss is the 15th consecutive confer—

sends Pitt home disappointedin ACC debut

ence loss for the team, a stretch that dates
back to 2011.-

“That was a, very tough and frustrating
loss tonight,” Pitt head coachJoeLuxbacher
said in a press release. “Our guys played
their best game of the year and played their

hearts out.'To lose on a disputed goal and '

come away from this game with nothing, in
terms of points, is obviously tremendously
disappointing.’’_’’
The Panthers did play extremely well
early on, as the team kept a talented N .C.
State team without a goal through regula-
tion. , I
. Early in the game, N.C. State had a few
opportunities to get on the board, but goal-

keeper Dan Lynd kept the Panthers in the
game. The best chance came in the 15th
minute when Dan Lynd made a nice save
off a shot from Nazmi Albadawi. The save
was the ﬁrst in a series of ﬁve saves for Lynd
throughout the evening.

The Panthers’ best chance to take a 1-0
lead came in the 84th minute, when Ju-
lian Dickenson sent a shot that was saved
by Wolfpack goalie Fabian Otte. The shot
however, started a sequence that featured
a pair of Panthers corner kicks toward the
end of the half. Despite the two kicks, Pitt
was unable to score the elusive ﬁrst goal in
the ﬁnal three minutes, so the two teams
headed to golden goallovertime. '

In the overtime period, Panthers mid-
ﬁelder Nick Wysong almost gave the Pan-
thers a victory when he sent a shot that was
just wide on the left-hand side of the goal.

‘Just lessthan -two minuteslater, N .C. State '
r scored the game—winning goal.

“We can take a lot from this game,”
Luxbacher said. “We were able to go into
a hostileenvironment and compete with a
great team. We will learn from our mistakes
and use this as motivation going forward
in ACC play.” i  if I I

The loss marked the third straight game
in which the Panthers went into overtime.

Pitt had picked up back-to-back ties against S 

Oakland and Longwood. I . : I

COLUMN

Steelers season can wait

Tyler Pecyna
Assistant Sports_Edz't'o1"

It is foolish to gauge performance based
on a single game. But Sunday’s 16-9
Steelers loss to the Titans conﬁrms one
credo: It’s still not football season in
Pittsburgh.

The calendar tells us hockey is still a
week from preseason play and slightly a
month away from officially commencing.
Furthermore, the Penguins are virtually
unchanged since their postseason heart-
break last year. Whether or not that’s a
good thing is up in the air, but it’s not
time to ponder that.

This is an iconoclastic stance, pushing
aside the Steelers in the fall and not fo-
cusing on the Pens for the time being, but
I think the city ought to be more focused

i on the Pirates this year. Unfortunately,

the Bucs were demolished in St. Louis
the past three games and relinquished
the division lead in the process. ,

There are just 20 games remaining
in the Pirates’ regular season, none of
which will come against the Cardinals.
On the series for the year, though, Pitts-'
burgh bested St. Louis in 10 of 19 con-
tests.

It’s been a similar story for the Pi-
rates’ record against the Reds, who
are merely a game behind them in the
standings. And of those ﬁnal 20 Pirates
games, 30 percent are against Cincin-
nati, including the last three at Great
American Ballpark from Sept. 27 to 29.

Now take a peek at the Steelers’
upcoming matchups: the Bengals, the
Bears and the=Vikings. Are any of those
contests being touted as a Super Bowl
preview? Sure, the game against Cincin-
nati’s lesser pro team is a Monday Night
Football telecast. Chicago isua Sunday-
night national broadcast on NBC. Fans
are treated to watching Adrian Peterson
when Pittsburgh is in Minnesota. But
none of these is noteworthy for reasons
pertinent to the Steelers’ success.

Now extrapolate that across the first
half of Pittsburgh’s football season. With
the exception of an ‘Oct. 20 contest at
home against Baltimore, nothing jumps

off the schedule as a headliner in the first
eight weeks.

Consider that the MLB postseason
schedule has the National League Cham-
pionship series ending just before that
game against the Ravens, further en-
trenching it as the most compelling un-
dertaking the Steelers encounter in the
first half of the 2013 campaign.

The next three Steelers games fall on

A dates that also host Pirates games. One

such date is Sept. 29, when Pittsburgh’s
football team faces Peterson and the
Vikings and the baseball contingent ends
its regular season — and perhaps its
possible postseason chances, too — in
Cincinnati.

The disparity in importance of sched-
ule is epitomized on Oct. 27. The late-fall
day features game four of the World Se-
ries, a possible clinchinglmatch. Oh, and
of course the Steelers—Raiders “battle.”

This isn’t to say that the Pirates are
going topbe clinching the World Series
that day, or that they’ll begin the World
Series or the postseason at all. Rather,
it’s a commentary on the irrelevance
of the first eight weeks of the Steelers’
football season.

It’s a reminder that the remainder
of the Pirates’ schedule —— to be played
out in 21 days —— outnumbers the games
the Steelers will play — with moderate
success, possibly -— over the next four
months. H

With the Steelers failing to surpass
250 yards of offense against Tennes-
see on Sunday, all while losing Pro Bowl
center Maurkice Pouncey and linebacker
Larry Foote possibly for the whole sea-
son, the season outlook dims a bit more.

The same can be said of the week-
end sweep the Pirates endured at the
hands of St. Louis, but they are a near
lock for a postseason berth — evidenced
by Baseball Prospectus pegging the odds
of a playoff appearance at 99.8 percent
for the Bucs. _

A's September winds down, prioritize
the attention given to Pittsburgh’s teams:
The Pirates are ﬁghting for a playoff spot
while the Steelers seem likely to be tight-
ing for a better pick in next year’s draft.

Panthers Win three matches, take home UConn Classic

Caitlin Hinsey
Stcgj” Writer

The Panthers captured their ﬁrst tournament _

title win this past weekend in Storrs, Conn.,
going 3-0 on their way to winningthe UConn
Classic over Albany, Northeastern and Con-
necticut. ,

- -Kate Yeazel was named the tournament

MVP and Jessica Wynn and Delaney Cleseny

were named to the All—Toumament Team.
“To actually be the tournament MVP
means everything, and it’s just a really big
-blessing,” Yeazel said.

Pitt (5-2) won three straight sets versus .

Albany with scores of 25-18, 25-14 and 25-15.
But the Panthers started off slow, which forced
them to call a timeout once Albany went up
7-5. After the timeout, though, Pitt ran off
four straight points. One of sophomore setter
Jenna]acobson’s career-high ﬁve aces in that
match highlighted that dominating stretch.
“I think serves are reallyiimportant. It’s the
ﬁrst ball that goes in.” Jacobson said. “If it’s

Albany came within two points multiple times

but never got ahead of the surging Panthers. " ’

The Panthers never trailed in the third set,
and their largest lead came at match point

when Yeazel and sophomore Jessica Boddy ‘

blocked Albany and gave the Panthers the 25-
15 victory. Yeazel led the team with 13 kills and
tied Boddy with ﬁve blocks. Wynn, a junior
outside hitter,‘and junior opposite Mechael
Guess chipped in double-digit kills.

Pitt continued its strong performance
Saturday versus Northeastern, defeating the
Huskies 25-18, 25-16 and 25-15.

The ﬁrst set was close, but a 10-2 Pitt run
separated the two teams. The Panthers were
able to capture points thanks to Yeazel and
Guess, who together scored 11 of the team’s
12 kills, while redshirt freshmanjenna Potts

battle late into the second half before either
team would look to score.

Toward the end of the match the Pan-

With just a few seconds left on the clock,

As MacLeod continued to race toward
the goal, Sharick was able to catch up with
the streaking Rockets player and block a
shot that MacLeod riﬂed toward the net.
The ball deﬂected out of play fora corner
kick, but time ran out on the Rockets, and
Pitt was able to hold on for a 1-0 victory.

“The chance was my fault, because I

said. “So at that point, _I knew I needed to

The third set resembled the ﬁrst set be-

tween these two teams. Pitt needed a run to
_ help build a lead against the Huskies, who won
the ﬁrst two points. But the Panthers clawed ’

their way back and took a 3-2 lead. Following
an 8-2 run, the Panthers strongly held onto
their lead with the score at 9-5. During this
run,Jacobson served another two aces and the
team talliedkillsfrom Wynn, Guess and Yeazel.
Jacobson ﬁnished with three aces and her
ﬁrst double—double of the ‘season with 21 as-
sists and 10 digs. Clesen led- the team with
15‘digs and freshman outside hitter Maria»
Genitsaridi added 12 digs and four blocks.

The Panthers had their biggest match of
the tournament on Saturday night against
the host team and their former Big East foe,
Connecticut. Pitt bounced back after losing
the ﬁrst set to win three of the next four, ulti-
mately defeating UConn 20-25, 25-17, 25-16,
23-25 and 15-9. .

Despite dropping the ﬁrst set, Pitt gained
momentum toward the end and carried it over
to the second and third sets. Pitt outhit UConn
signiﬁcantlyinthese two sets, with Pitt’s .350
mark dwarﬁng Connecticut’s sub-.1500 per-
formance.

As Pitt entered the fourth set, however, its

momentum was drained when the Huskies .

fought back to earn the win. Pitt came back and
tied the score at 23 before a Panthers error and
set point allowed Connecticut to win the set,

The fifth set started offstrongfor Pi_tt: Yea-

‘ zel had the ﬁrst three kills, jump—starting the

team to a 4-2 lead. After a block from Potts,
Pitt was able to hold a two-point advantage
that lasted for most of the set. The Panthers

. ﬁnished off the match by scoring ﬁve of the last
six points — with two of the last three points

registered on kills by Wynn. . A

V Pitt sported a total of nine aces — with
Boddy having three of her own —- and 16.5
blocks. Potts‘, who had 10 of those blocks,
became the ﬁrst Panthérto hit double ﬁgures.

the match with 17 kills and seven blocks. Gen-
itsaridi chipped in a personal best 11 kills and
