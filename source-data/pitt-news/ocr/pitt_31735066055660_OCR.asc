Pitt Police cleans up Oakland

Two suspects wanted

for ATM scam

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

Pitt Police are warning ATM machine users in

Oakland of a scam where victims are being robbed of
hundreds of dollars.
 Pitt Police Chief Rick Boyd said the scenario
involves two suspects — one white, one black — who
have been hitting ATM machines around Forbes
Avenue since last weekend.

The first person is a black male, described as 5-foot-
8, 140 pounds with scruffy hair, a gray hood and gold-
rimmed glasses. According to police he approaches an
individual at an ATM machine and says he knows

tirn a phony deposit slip,” Boyd said

The suspect then has the person withdraw the
money from the phony deposit, claiming that it’s not
from their own account and they can split the money.
Then from behind the scene, the white suspect enters.
He claims to be an off-duty Philadelphia police oﬂicer
and asks the suspect and victim questions about what’s
going on.

“Just while the victim begins to get skeptical [of the
first suspect’s claim], the second guy claiming to be a
cop comes in, and the other guy slips away with the
money,” Boyd said.

The white suspect is described by Pitt Police as
arormd 6-foot, 200 pounds, scruffy faced, with dirty
blond hair and earrings in both ears.

Boyd said the scam has happened at least two times
and he encourages anyone who encotmters a situation
like this to “immediately remove your card from the
machine and contact the police immediately.”

Union organizer recruits Pitt

By Cesca Antonelli

News Assistant

The AFL-CIO has returned to
Pittsburgh, a town where unions once
thrived with the then-booming steel
industry, but this time the recruiting
push is aimed at students.

Maria Wickstrom, a representative
of the AFL—CIO Organizing Institute,
will speak about a new summer
internship program designed for col-
lege students, both undergraduate and
graduate, called Union Summer on
Wednesday at 8 p.m. in lK56 of
Forbes Quad.

Union Summer participants will
spend three weeks in June, July or
August organizing non-unionized

workers and helping them coordinate
with and expand existing unions in
their areas. Students will receive free
housing and training, as well as a
$210 per week stipend, while work-
ing at one of the 10-20 campaigns
nationwide.

“This is a chance to rebuild the
labor movement and to play a pivotal
role in building a movement for
social change and economic justice
through union organizing,”
Wickstrom said. “If we are really to
be able to stop the trends we are fac-
ing, it is only going to be through
organizing.”

The trends that Wickstrom will
speak about include falling wages
and large-scale corporate layoffs that

ZBT was permanently
kicked out of Pitt last
December and lost its house
on Sutherland Drive next to
Pitt Stadium as a result. The
house, empty since the begin-

movement,” Wickstrom
said. .

Since November, when
John J. Sweeney became
the new president of the
AFL-CIO, 22 organizers
have visited more than 100
colleges across the country
to help fulfill two of his
major" goals — new blood
and new hope. The
Organizing Institute hopes
to train 1,000 new organiz-
ers through Union Summer
and to include those new
organizers in an attempt to
reverse the decline in union
membership.

“I think it’s a very impor-
tant opportunity for Pitt
students to participate and
gain understanding of the
broader problems of
American society,” said
Michael Jiménez, an assis-
tant professor of history
who arranged the visit.
“Our country is more com-
plex, is in more trouble,
than we are willing to
acknowledge within this
university and within the
middle-class backgrounds
that most of us are coming
from.”

Wickstrom said that stu-
dents needed to be aware of
the difficulties facing the
workforce today and how
to stand up for themselves.

“We need to be thinking
of ourselves as the next
generation of workers. We
are faced with some pretty

scary times in the work-
place,” Wickstrom said.

The campaign sites have
not been named yet and
will be finalized within the
next two or three weeks.
Possible sites include both
rural and urban areas in the
Northwest, South, Midwest
and California.

Most participants will be
placed in the campaign
closest to their homes
because transportation
costs are not included.
Students with a background
or training in another lan-
guage will be located on a

campaign where their skills
will be most effective.

While working on these
campaigns, students will
organize and attend pick-
ets, rallies, marches and
press conferences in order
to build coalitions with
community groups, as well
as passing out leaflets to
promote awareness.
Participants will also have
the opportunity to go door-
to-door talking with work-
ers about the conditions
they face and the things
they’d like to change about
their jobs.

Union Summer is mod-
eled after Freedom Summer
‘64, when the civil rights
movement called students
to Mississippi to register
African—Americans to vote
and educated a generation
of people about the prob-
lems facing the South.

“Similarly, Union
Summer is the first time
that the labor movement
has put a call out to young
people to help workers gain
a voice in their workplace,”
Wickstrom said.

In addition to the skills
gained during their orga-

nizing experience,
Wickstrom hopes to pro-
vide students with an
“Action Kit” of materials,
resources and possibly a
guide about the issues that
need to be addressed by
students and workers on
their own campuses.

Graduating seniors can
also train to be full-time
organizers by applying to
the Organizing Institute’s
four—month apprenticeship
program. Such trainees
receive $400 per week plus
transportation and health
insurance.

Another dumb lawsuit

There’s an old joke - What do you call 100 lawyers at the bottom
of the ocean? A good start.

It’s not too funny, but it rings with some truth with the beginning
of the Bernard Goetz civil trial later this week.

The facts are pretty simple: Four thugs entered a New York City
subway in 1984 and walked up and down the aisles, terrorizing peo-
ple as they went.

They came upon a person who, unbeknownst to them, was carry-
ing a concealed weapon. One of the criminals wielded a screwdriver
in the person’s face.

The person with the gun, Bernard Goetz, pulled out his weapon
and fired. One of the criminals he hit was Darrell Cabey, who is now
suing Goetz to the tune of $50 million.

This lawsuit is a joke. When Cabey boarded that subway and
decided to mug innocent citizens, he forfeited his right to sue. Now,
at the same time, that doesn’t excuse Goetz or promote vigilante jus-
tice. But suing?

Unfortunately, this kind of ridiculous lawsuit isn’t a novelty. A
few years ago a motorcycle-driving suspect was being chased by
Pittsburgh City Police and he crashed into a truck. He sued the
police department to pay for his injuries.

These lawsuits are putting our legal system on shaky ground.
There definitely needs to be some reform of the system when a
criminal can sue because he gets shot in the act of a committing a
crime.

Good move, judge

Speaking of reform, it seems that one of President Clinton’s liber-
al federal judges has reversed one of the most backwards decisions
ever made in a courtroom. '

After mounting political pressure, last week Judge Harold Baer of
New York reversed a decision that originally put admitted drug deal-
ers back on the street.

In the original ruling, Baer said New York City Police officers did
not have justification forxsearcliing a car in which over $4 million
dollars worth of heroin and cocaine were found. The officers spotted
suspects placing something in the car and when the officers
approached the scene, the suspects ﬂed.

Baer said that ﬂeeing the scene was acceptable, in fact warranted,
because New York City cops are usually wrong.

What Baer forgot about was the videotaped confession and the 80
pounds of drugs that were found in the car.

Baer made a good move in reversing his poor decision. But now
he’ll probably be sued by the drug dealer for violating her rights.

V—chip takes care of TV violence

Given the team that has
adopted the plan, it’s not sur-
prising that the problem of
senseless violence on televi-
sion has been given a sense-
less solution. The ratings sys-
tem and V-chip that the presi-
dent and the networks have
agreed to has about as much of
a chance of being successful
as a homemade space shuttle.

Sure, the chip will work
mechanically. Anyone with
basic cable will tell you that
channels can be blocked. But
the larger goal, the.one Clinton
wants, is the end of serious
crime, which he thinks is
caused by the desensitization
to violence when a child
watches killings on TV before
he turns 18. There are three
assumptions required to
believe that, all of them false.

The first is the belief in a
better society through the use
of gadgets. We Americans
have such a love for gadgets
that we’ve come to depend on
them, no matter what the prob-
lem. So, while we have won
the struggle against the prob-
lems of transportation and
labor, for example, we’ve been
terrible at solving other dilem-
mas: race relations, land poli-
cy and military hegemony, to
name a few.

The fact is, gadgets are use-
less for solving problems of
behavior, policy and morals.
Since violence is a behavioral
issue, the V-chip’s failure is
guaranteed. (although now that
I think about it, there has been
one gadget that has solved a
behavioral problem, but the
less said about the chastity belt
the better —— we don’t want to
give any policy makers or
authority figures any ideas.)

The second assumption is
that childhood would some-
how not be violent if TV
weren’t around to goad the
kids into it. An amazing
amount of memory repression
would have to take place for
someone to believe that.

Think of your own child-

Jon
Henrv

hood, and not the photo-album
version of it either. You didn’t
spend your first 10 years kiss-
ing your grandmother, sitting
on the Easter Bunny’s lap and
nothing else. Psychologists,
looking to do something use-
ful, should stop counting the
number of televised phony
acts of violence a child has
seen before his 18th birthday
and start counting how many
real ones he has participated
in.

I had a typical boyhood
(sorry to alienate the entire
female sex —— it’s just that you
don’t commit enough of the
crimes that the V-chip will
supposedly prevent). There
was, I recall, barely enough
time for the sibling rivalry,
fist—fighting, teasing of domes-
ticated animals (and outright
cruelty to wild ones, like the
lightning bug, whose only nat-
ural enemy is the nine—year-
old with a wifﬂe-ball bat) and
the random acts of mischief
associated with nearly every
chﬂdhood. '

Leisure time was devoted to
games. These games had won-
derfully descriptive names,
such as “Kill the Man”
(known locally as “Smear the
Queer”). “Suicide” and
“Roughhouse.” Considering
the time devoted to hurting or
breaking things, it’s hard to
believe that I ever found time
to read,.tie my shoes or ride a
bike.

The third assumption is the
most ridiculous, though. It
entails a belief that violence in
childhood will necessarily lead
to violence in adulthood.
except that. by then. the vio-
lence will be brought to crimi-
nal extremes. The only evi-
dence l have. or need. is
myself and my friends and
what we’ve done since our
teens. None of us has thrown a
brother or sister down a well.
None of us has shot a person

for annoying us. None of us
has thrown lye on a cat. And
none of us has burnt down
Sophie the Old Lady’s house
because we think she is a
crank.

How did we do it? Mostly,
we just grew out of that kind
of behavior (and we developed
a pretty ﬁrm grasp of the con-
cept “tried as an adult”). And
the way in which we gre‘w”up
is, I suspect, the problem with
society, not TV.

That way was, of course, our
parents. From infancy to ado-
lescence, we were constantly
being shown what was right
and , what wasn’t. Sometimes,
these lessons were indirect, as
when we noticed that our par-
ents never shoplifted, so we
shouldn’t either. Other times,
they were more direct, like
when my dad told me that girls
don’t like it when you kill
their pets with chemicals.
That’s how I put the lye idea
out of my mind.

I’m not sure that today’s
children are getting this kind
of instruction. More adults

_ than ever think it’s OK to lie,

cheat and steal, if the polls are
to be believed. (I know, I
know, I see the logical gap in
asking admitted liars to answer
questions truthfully. but I saw
this on TV. so it must be true.)
Ethics in their households
must be reduced to “If you
don’t get caught. it isn’t
wrong" and “If it feels good.
do it.”

Until Clinton realizes that
kids can handle violence. and
stops blaming TV for the lack
of self-discipline. remorse.
manners and simple distinc-
tions between right and wrong.
the law—abiding citizens of this
country will continue to be
forced to guard their property
as they do now. and Socks will
have to continue to look over
his shoulder for people with
potassium carbonate.

omething is really

wrong. A

Last Saturday, over
30,000 people showed up for
the inaugural Major League
Soccer game between the
San Jose Clash and the D.C.
United. The game was played
on American soil, it was not
a World Cup, Olympic or
Tournament contest and, as
far as I know, attendance was
not mandatory for prison
inmates or California Public
School students.

At the same time, the A
Oakland A’s were forced to
play six home games in Las
Vegas and nobody in
California noticed.

Maybe they thought the
team dissolved after Tony
LaRussa left. Whatever the
reason, there was no public
outcry. The Vegas crowd
amounted to about 12,000
people per game, most of
whom only showed up when
they couldn’t get tickets to
Sigfried and Roy.

Like I said, something is
really wrong.

Soccer, which used to be a
sideshow confined to Europe
and elementary school, sold
out a stadium. Baseball,
which used to be a national
pastime, couldn't even get a
stadium, and became a Vegas
sideshow.

One’s first instinct might
be to blame the mess on
California and file the sub-
ject with bad surfer movies
and expensive coffee. But it’s
deeper than that — this soc-
cer thing is starting to get
serious.

Apparently, this new MLS,
which sounds more like a ter-
minal illness than a sports
league, is now a First-
Division soccer organization,
which puts it on par with
European soccer. It has teams
all over the nation, in major
markets like Southern
California and New York.
Also, it has a cable TV deal
with ESPN and its offspring.

The league features inter-
national stars as well as local
favorites Alexi Lalas and
Tony Meola -— or, as many

not comment on the
umpire’s decision to call the
game, only saying that the
call “spoke for itself.”

In the front end of the
doubleheader, the Panthers
jumped out to a 3-0 lead in
the second inning. With two
outs, sophomore Jeff Murse
singled to ignite a rally.

Murse then stole second on
a close play, and catcher
Bill Derr then planted a line
drive in left center field
,scoring Murse with the
first run of the day.

Next, Kevin Knox took a
high pitch and stroked it to
left field advancing Derr to
third. The ninth-spot hitter,

Lou Melucci, came to the
plate next and fouled off
three pitches before belting
a liner into right center. The
hit scored Derr and Knox,
but Melucci was tagged out
trying to stretch his hit into
a triple.

The three runs in the sec-
ond were all Pitt would
need behind the combined
pitching of lefty Steve
Kubicek, Rob Shaffer and
Jason Rakaczewski.

Kubicek cruised through
the first two innings allow-
ing only one hit. In the third
he got in a jam after giving
up a double and a walk to

had seen enough and made
the switch to Shaffer. The
righty responded to the call

Split track teams compete at Miami and IUP

By Geoff Moaik
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s and women’s track teams couldn’t have
picked two more different meets to attend last weekend.
About half of the team competed in Miami, Fla.; the other
half took a less exotic trip to Indiana University of
Pennsylvania.

The Miami meet was primarily for sprinters, hurdlers and
field event performers, and not just for those in college.
The meet attracted plenty of top-notch post-collegiate ath-
letes, including Gillian Russell, a world champion in the
women’s 100-meter hurdles, and several former All-
Americans.

mark for the NCAA Championships in the triple jump with
leaps of 42-5 1/4 and 42-7 1/2, respectively. Smith also was
a guinea pig for an event.

“We decided to explore with her,” Lewis said. “She led
off the mile relay, and she had a very good leg.”

The women’s mile relay team of Smith, Martin, Purter
and Ayne Allen took second place of six college teams.

The men also had their fair share of good performances.

In the preliminary heats of the 100-meters, Pitt’s Jay
Jones and Anthony Dorsett took fifth and sixth, the last two
runners to make the finals. In the finals, they took second
and third, behind only former All-American Marcel Carter.

Jones and Dorsett formed half of the 400-meter relay
team that came in second place, just

ers were college athletes. Nearly
half of the events were won by
unattached (non-collegiate) ath-
letes.

“We knew how this meet goes.
We go around that problem by not entering certain events.
Some opportunities just aren’t there,” Lewis said.

Events that.,Pitt did enter turned out well. In the women’s
400-meter hurdles, Pitt had five of the top nine finalists.
Angie Martin and Tonya Mullins finished one-two, Shana
Fadis and Joetta Purter were fifth and sixth, and Najuma
Fletcher rounded out Pitt’s finishers in ninth place.

“Najuma and Joetta both fell in that race. We should’ve
been a lot tougher,” Lewis said.

The star of the day for Pitt was Trecia Smith. Among col-
legians, Smith finished second in the shot put, third in the
triple jump and in the javelin, and fourth in the discus.
Smith, along with Fletcher, hit the provisional qualifying

That means in certain events, col-

made up the rest of the relay team.

The men weren’t quite as suc-
cessful in the 400-meter hurdles as
the women, but they still had a
strong showing. Of the 16 runners
who qualified for the finals, Pitt
I —-Steve Lewis had three of the top ten finishers in

Head Track Coach Murphy, Williams and Orrel Green.

Meanwhile, the rest of Pitt’s
athletes, and Assistant Coach Dave Sobal, were in the cold
and snow at IUP. The near-freezing temperatures and inter-
mittent snow was a’prob1em for some athletes.

“It was hard for the jumpers to get warmed up. It took a
while, but as they got warm, it went a little better,” Sobal
said.

Gennifer Washington warmed up enough to take second
place in the triple jump with 36-5. Shameka Osborne also
had a second place finish with a shot put of 33-9 1/2.

The distance runners seemed to have the easiest time bat-
tling the elements. Natasha Van Reil and Tamika Dorin
were first and third in the women’s 800-meters, and Anna

fourth and fifth innings by only letting two runners reach
base. In the sixth, after getting two outs, the Penguins put
together a rally with an error and two back-to-back sin-
gles. With the bases loaded, Jackson went to his closer
Rakaczewski who subdued the batter into an easy pop-up
to third that ended the inning.

In the top of the seventh, Rakaczewski faced the
top of the Youngstown lineup and set them all down on
strikes. The last batter whiffed on all three
pitches he saw.

Again, as they did in the first game, the Panthers jumped
on the Penguins for three runs in the first inning. Center-
fielder Jason Conti led off the inning with a walk and then
stole second. Kurt Womelsdorf then singled, moving Conti
to third. After a line out by Joe Carter, first baseman Rob
Garvey hit a grounder through the wickets of the
Youngstown third baseman, scoring Conti. Designated hit-
ter Steve Dickinson walked to load the bases and then
Murse walked on a 3-2 pitch to give Pitt its second run.
Knox finished the two-out rally with a single knocking in
the third run of the game for Pitt.

“The first inning was the only inning we had any clutch
hitting the entire game,” said Jackson.

In the top of the second inning, starter Kevin Kramer
lost his good stuff, giving up a run and having runners at
first and third with one out. The next batter for
Youngstown smashed a high drive to.center field. Conti
turned and ran as soon as the ball left the bat. He sprinted
to the wall and jumped, making the catch while crashing
into the wall. The runner on third tagged up and scored,
making the score 3-2.

Jackson then brought in lefty Carl Vollmer who didn’t
even have to throw a pitch to get out of the inning. After a
couple of pick-off attempts, one got away from him and
the runner advanced to second. On the next pitch, he faked
like he was going home with the pitch, but then spun
around and gunned down the sliding runner to end the
inning.

In the third inning, Pitt again mustered a two-out rally.
Catcher Guy Sisto walked and then reached second on a
wild pitch. Next, Murse emerged from the dugout. The
count went to 3-0 in Murse’s favor. Then the pitcher
fought back to get it to 3-2. Murse then calmly stroked a
single to right over the outstretched glove of the second
baseman, scoring Sisto with the go-ahead run.

_ In the top of the fourth, right-hander John Schultz gave
up a single with runners on first and second with two outs,
which tied the score at 4-4.

Throughout the remaining eight innings that were
played, Pitt had several opportunities to score, but
couldn’t come up with a base hit in the clutch.

“We had lots of chances to win the game. You want to
win those games that you have the chance to win,” said
Jackson. “That’s been the problem all year, the ability to
hit with guys on base. It’s been happening over and over
again. A couple more hits here and there and we would
have four or five more wins.”

Pitt’s most frustrating missed scoring opportunity came
in the bottom of the sixth. Derr led off with a towering
double that hit the base of the fence. Melucci then bunted
for a base hit'that also moved Derr to third. Conti then
batted with no outs and runners on first and third, and he
lifted a weak pop-up to left field that wasn’t deep enough
for the runner to tag up. Then, Womelsdorf was intention-
ally walked to load the bases. Joe Carter got the count to
3-2 and then grounded to the third baseman who threw
home for the force out, making it two outs. Garvey fol-
lowed with a strike out to end the inning.

Kohler won the 400—meter
hurdles. Kohler,
Washington, Dorin and Van
Reil teamed up to win the
mile relay for Pitt.

In the first 3000-meter
race for a Pitt woman this
season, Stephanie Ellsworth
won easily with 10:36.5,
over 20 seconds ahead of
her nearest competitor.

“The level of competition
was not what we usually run
against,” Sobal said. “It was
good for us to race at the
front.”

Nowhere was that more
evident than in the men’s
800-meters. Pitt’s Scott

Curry won the race in
1:58.79. Brothers Mark and
Mike Bufalini were third
and fourth. All three led the
race at one point and
all finished within 1.1 sec-
onds.

“It wasn’t a fast race, but
it was very tactical. It’s
good for them to think about
running for the lead. We’re
usually not in a position to
do that,” Sobal said.

In a similar situation,
Dennis Kuntz and Matt
Samuel were the top two
finishers in the men’s 5000-
meters to round out Pitt’s
weekend.

If you happen to be a tradi-
tionalist sports fan like this
writer, you are presently rush-
ing for your Sports Bible (on
the top shelf between the reg-
ular Bible and the SI swim-
suit edition) to see if this is a
sign of the apocalypse.

I’ll save you the trouble.
lt’s the sixth sign, right after
the cancellation of the World
Series but before the back-to-
back Cubs championships.

Something is really wrong.

Soccer was, is and (hope-
fully) always will be a pleas-
ant diversion —— something to
watch at 2 a.m. when pro
wrestling is pre-empted, and a
competitive way for kids to
keep shape if their parents
don’t let them play youth-
league football. It’s good for
a prime-time appearance once
every 20 years, when a World
Cup comes to the states and
brings that Spanish guy who
yells a lot every time some-
body scores. ‘

Kind of like a fancy
European food — it’s nice
every once in a while, but it
isn’t something you’d want
more than once a month. It
doesn’t come close to All-
American foods like ham-
burgers, french fries and 3
pizza —- stuff we stole from
Europe and changed to fit our

. culture.

We tried that with soccer a
few years ago, and ended up
with the indoor league.
Budweiser and MasterCard
have yet to sign on.

Now the MLS is here,
bringing the full outdoor
glory of the European game
to the States, hopefully minus
the bloody riots. That’s right
fans, no official clock, no
bathroom breaks, and, of
course, no scoring except in
absolute emergencies.

How this league became
financially viable is beyond
reason. Teams are playing in
college stadiums with foreign
players, multicolored
European-style uniforms and
laughable nicknames. The
Kansas City Wiz comes to
mind.

As for the game ‘itself,
guess what the final of the
inaugural contest was. Yep,
the Clash beat the United 1-0,
in a rare game that didn’t
involve penalty kicks. ESPN
highlights featured the goal, a
few missed goals, and some
snide remarks from Keith
Olberman.

Yet the fans showed up.
And by all accounts, the fans
will show up for the rest of
the season. Soccer is making
inroads into theAmeriean
sportsworld faster than a los-
ing Colombian team can say
“No, thanks, we really don’t
want a convertible for the
homecoming parade.”

Something is really wrong.
