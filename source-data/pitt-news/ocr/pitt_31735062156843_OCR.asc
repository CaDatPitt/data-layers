.Wallace To Speak--

But,Not at University

In an effort to clarify the University’s position concerning politi-
cal matters, faculty oﬂicials are going -to review Pitt’s policy.

Meanwhile, Henry Wallace will speak this afternoon under
the sponsorship of a partisan city political group. _

Prior to this, the University has not had assemblies for discus-
sion of any controversial politicalquestions. Any change of policy will

not affect the Wallace meeting as it is not a University affair.

n

Responding to an offer from the Progressive Citizens of America
to have Wallace speak, Student Congress asked that the school review
its stand. The offer caused consid-e ' I

erable controversy at the last Con-
gress imeeting and the matter was
presented to Chancellor Fitzgerald.

Any statement of the present
Pitt policy will have to await the
outcome of the administration’s
review. However, whatever deci-
sion is imade, it will not affect
the University’s position regarding
this afternoon’s meeting. Since. it
is an affair of a political group
it will not receive sanction of the
school.

Boy   Scouts

To Entertain

New Rushees

The spirit of’ the Boy Scout
livps on in the University.

Pitt students who were or still
are Boy Scouts are invited to at-

, tend the “Rushing” Meeting” of the

Beta Qlhapter of the Alpha Phi
Omega Fraternity, a. National
Service‘ Fraternity. Only ‘students
who have been Boy Scouts are

_privileged to "belong to this fra-

C ternity.

Ever since the demise of the
Druids, the ancient Sophomore
Activities Society two years ago,
Alpha Phi Omega alone has con-
tinued to serve Pitt. Alpha Phi
Omega has conducted student
elections, helped at Freshman
Week, and provided many other
services for Pitt. '

At this year’s rushing meeting,
7:45 p. m., Wednesday, Nov. 12,
in Room 332 Cl., rushees will be
served refreshments. The com-
mittee emphasizes that only for-

f mer and presently enrolled Boy
_' Scouts are invited. *

lV.[r. J. Frederik Miller, Execu-
tive Secretary of the YMCA, will
speak, and.D.r. Kent D. Shaffer,
a member of the National Execu-
tive Board will also be present.

Band Makes
Purdue Trip
By Greyhound

For the ﬁrst time since before
the war, Pitt’s famed Varsity
Marching Band will inake two
trips with the football team in one
season when it journeys to West
Lafayette, Ind., for the Pitt—Pur—
due gridiron fracas next Satur-
day.

A decision by Chancellor R. H.
Fitzgerald last Saturday morning
carried the necessary approval for
the trip. _

The full complement of 120
members and all the managers
and alternates will leave here Fri-
day and go to Indianapolis by
Greyhound busses.

Formations for the .pre-game
and half-time performances have
been worked out and rehearsed.
Purdue, like all other Western
Conference universities, has an
excellent marching band which is
expected to offer an interesting

competition- for Pitt’s Blue and."

Gold bandsmen.

X-Rays Easy.
Painless Way
To Make‘Sure

Time is wasting away and so
are your lungs, maybe. ‘

Better go to the Schenley Room
on the ﬁrst ﬂoor of the Cathedral
and get an X-Ray taken. Like the
better things in life it’s free, and
easy to get. —

The X-Ray takes less than a
minute, does not require the re-
moval of clothes, is painless, and
administered by competent Public
Health Service employees.

Over 300 lives were taken in
Pittsburgh last year as the result
of tuberculosis. It is a sneak-kill-
er. Without X-rays the victim us-
ually doesn’t discover the disease
until it is too late.

In previous years, cases caught
in the early stages by X-rays at
Pitt responded to summer treat-
ment. Students did. not miss any

school during the convalescent

period.
This Friday, Nov. 15, is the last
day X-rays will be given.

Contest Winner Claims Soup

Provides .'Real

Meal Appeal'

Would you like to hear all about the ﬁner points of Betty C.rocker
Vegetable Noodle Soup? If so, ask Pitt student Maurice Oseroﬁ‘,
winner in a recent General Mills contest.

“Nothing ventured, nothing gained,” he told himself, and so he
entered the competition when high hopes, after fortifying himself

with a big dish of noodle soup.

He didn’t win "a million dollars in gold or a platinum helicopter,

but’ General Mills did
through with a $200 Keepsake dia-
mond ring and a cheery congratu-
latory message.

“We’re happy that your use of
Betty Crocker Vegetable Noodle
Soup brought you into the "con-
test,” they declared, “and we hope
that you will tell many of your
friends just why you like Betty
Crocker Soups."

,The winning answer. in case
you’d like to know just what it
takes to win one of those con-
tests, was “I like Betty Crocker
Vegetable Noodle Soup because it

has real meal appeal.”

In case you’d like to get in

Progress S Penalties

The man who noted penalties of progress
was in step with that progress.

Last week, Student Congress, by a close
vote, asked for a restatement of University con-
cerning Henry Wallace’s requested speech
here today. The policy, as we understand it,
rules out all political speakers from the campus.

Congress’, this year, has brought student

' ' opinion to the front more than at any time dur-

ing the past ﬁve years. It is too bad that the
organization met the problem of political speak-
ers with the name of Henry Wallace. Many
letters. have reached our mail box and innum-
erable activities men have stated that they
would be in favor of hearing the man-—but
that it is deﬁnitely a touchy situation.

' It It GI 9

That seems to be the case. If it had been
General Eisenhower or Governor Duff who had
requested permissionto speak on. campus, the
problem could have been aired without the
pressure accompanying the Wallace discussion.
Something constructive might have come out
of "it. . U I
As it is, however, the University could do

‘little more than adhere, without further con-

sideration, toits stated policy.

# ’l= #

r The further penalty of Congress’ step is

the advantage this Pittsburgh political organi-
zation‘ can take. To them, Congress’ appeal for

a clariﬁcation of policy, was a victory for Hen-

ry Wallace; From an inside position, we can

say this isnot the case. «All discussion during

‘the meeting last week was centered about the

advisability of VVallace along with other speak-
ers to ﬁll out the ﬁve or six assembly pro-
gram remaining for the year. ,

But, the young radicals will claim complete
victory. And ‘the University and Student Con-

, gress are looked upon as havens for radicals

   

by our conservative friends.
Editorially, _ we say, ‘ ‘Ha.’ ’

A Good Idea

The announcement of work on a University
check room provides a lightened load for the
coat and satchel ridden commuter.

Under present preliminary plans, the check-
ing facilities will be open to all students and
faculty who ﬁnd themselves lugging coats, hats,
and brief cases through a lengthy schedule of
classes. Dean of Men Biddle is behind the
move and hopes that it will help lessen the
complaint against inadequate locker facilities.

The same checking procedure is now in ef-
feet‘ in many of_ the Midwestern schools, and has
proved _ a blessing in every instance. More‘ pow-

-‘ed U   uick enactment of

   

_ request for a re—statement of University policy on political speakers.

        
 

Policy Siaiemeni
The following letter was senltdto ‘Eugenia. Captain, Secretary of
Student Congress, by Chancellor Fitzgerald concerning the Congress

November 8, 1947
Miss Eugenia Captain ,
Secretary of Student Congress
Dear Miss Captain:

Your letter of November 6, received this morning, November. 8,
stated that Student Congress in its meeting on November ! had
passed the following motion: “that the University administration be
requested to review as soon as possible its policy against political
meetings and political speakers.”_ You urged, “that this be, done as
soon as possible so if any change in policy is to be made, Congress
may still consider the matter ofa Wallace meeting on Tuesday, No-
vember 11.’?

I think you and the members of Student Congress will understand
that important changes in University policy should not be made
without more time. for objective consideration. The motion of "Stu-
dent Congress will be presented for discussion .— at the next regular“
meeting of the University deans. "

I have been informed by Dean Lanfear, former Dean or Men,
and by Dean Biddle, present Dean of Men, that ‘the University of
Pittsburgh as a non-political‘ institution, has not _for a number of
years sponsored political speakers. _

V Sincerely Yours,
R. H. Fitzgerald."

Letters  the Editor
Girl Cheer Leadersf
Needed, Opines Frosh

Editor, the Pitt News: ~

In becoming acquainted with the University life one of the
many questions facing this freshman is-—why doesn't Pitt ﬁeld‘
women cheer leaders? ‘

Not only would they make a pleasing appearance but —would“
do much in bolstering up school spirit and enthusiasm, ‘both of which
Pitt could stand a very good‘ dose of. There is ‘some sort of_ policy
that very few students are acquainted with that prevents the ﬁelding
of women cheer leaders. I believe‘: '

Back

that student opinion and interest
is strong enough to improve such
a ‘situation, not only among the
freshmen where school spirit and
enthusiasm seem to ﬂourish, but
among the upperclassmen also.

Is there. any way that the stu-
dent body can learn the content
of this policy and in any way
work out some solution? If it is
a matter of the awkwardness in
transporting the women to out-of-
town games, I think it would be
worthwhile to have them cheer at
only the home gamesif need be;
There are a good many crack
high school cheer leaders who
would gladly give their time and
efforts for their Alma sMater. I
strongly believe that Pitt should
ﬁeld women. cheer leaders an_d
hope some improvement is made
toward that goal. _,

Chest Split-Up

Editor, Pitt News

Why should Pitt students con-
tribute to the Pitt Community
Fund drive instead of the County
Community Fund drive?

It is not clear why any Pitt or-
ganization needs the money more
than the 92 organizations of the

Collin. «

Holbrook Speaks Tomorrow  
Ai Siudeni Chapel Services

, Elmer Allan‘Holbrook, deanof the School of Engineering
and Mines, will be the speaker for the Student Services to-
morrow afternoon. The chapel choir, under the direction of
Dr. Finney, will sing, “Peace I Leave With You” by Me-

Holbrook, a native of Fitchburgh, Massachuesettes, attend-
ed the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from which he re-

County Community _Chest. If Pitt
organizations ' need ’ ‘this money
they should have it allotted to
them just as any one of the‘9"2 or-
ganizations. .

Our YMCA and .YWCA organi-
zations are mainly clubs for, so-
cial entertainment. Not that» Pitt
or the County shouldn't have social
clubs, but that college students,
in the main, are better able to
provide themselves, with ‘enter-
tainment than are the people
serviced. by outside, YM and
YWCAS, especially, since,__the ma-
jority of them are veterans who
are at least getting . some subsis-
tence nowadays. Like most of the
other social clubs on campus, the
members should pay their own
way.

°Our loan funds shouldlbe able
to remain solvent with their in-
terest rates, investments, etc., as
are most outside loan agencies.

As far as outright gifts are con-
cerned, such as “Pitt in —China,”
we should be asked for one.con-
tribution, to be proportionately
divided, separate from the Coun-
ty Community Chest drive.

Pitt students should consider
whether Pitt organizations need
their money more than the needy
of the 92 organizations of the

Cover Girl Graces Turkey Day

Stuffing the Thanksgiving issue with a cover girl, foui-9

additional pages, and several new features, the Panther Ma-
gazine will ignore rising prices on skimpy turkeys and go on

changed to Chesterﬁelds, but it
hasn’t done him any good.

Nixon Stage M
Plays Host
To 'Harvey'

By Hugh Gihnour

Celebrating its third year on
Broadway, “Harvey” bowed into
the Nixon recently and the
road company of this Pulitzer
prize-winning play gives just as
remarkable a performance as the
original cast.

Joe E. Brown gives an entire-
ly new version of the role creat-
ed by Frank Faye, but his por-
trayal of the inebriated and almy
Mr. Dowd is convincing. There
are times when he can’t resist
throwing in some of the old tricks
of his trade but he manages to
draw the line at the crucial point.

This is the playwright’s secon
attempt in the theatre. Back in
1936, Mrs. Chase was rather un-
successful with a little play that
folded up within a week. The in-
tervening years have added much
to her technique as a dramtist
and the play is a heartwarming
story that concerns everyone.
You’ll be convinced that the world
they are getting rarer.

Miss Marian Lorne is perfectly
cast as Elwood’s slightly nutty sis-
ter.

Students Lay

Housing Blame

On Labor. Real Estate Men

Four University students aired the housing problem recently

over station WJ AS.

. The group was made up of Robert Zisman, a 24-year-old mar-
ried veteran who aimes to become a clinical psychologist; William
Karasko, 26, single, a veteran, now studying in the. College toward a

degree in international law; Clifford Swenson, a 21-year-old un-

married Veteran, 3 psychology major; and Louis M. Leaderman, 19,

who is currently affected by thee

housing situation.

The moderator of the discussion
was William S. Tacey of the
speech department.

The program was entitled, “A
Place to Live.” The speakers dis-
cussed on an impromptu basis the
reasons for the housing shortage,
laying the blame primarily on the
doorstep of the wartime upset to
our economy. - '

‘  1 t = .. r

Labor took their share-of the
blame for demanding higher
wages while slowing up produc-
tion, and the real estate lobby was
knocked. The opinion was ex-
pressed that private enterprise has
been unwilling to cooperate be-
c_ause of proﬁt seeking. Facts and
ﬁgures were presented to sub-
stan ‘ate the ideas expressed.

Teachers Face
‘Bright Prospect

Employment prospects are bright inded for Pitt’s future gradu-

ates in the ﬁeld of education.

So states George Hoﬁman, head of the teacher placement bureau

cies in the _ﬁeld of education far outnumber the college trained

Witz Named
To Field Lab

Dr. Warren R. Witz, associate
professor of biology, was recent-
ly appointed director of Pitt’s
ﬁeld laboratory on Presque Isle
Peninsula, located near Erie, Pa.

Dr. Witz succeeded Dr. 0. E.
Jennings as director of the labora-
tory when the latter retired from
the position to work for the Car-
negie Museum. With the assist-
ance of Dr. C. A. Tryon and Dr.
R. F. Griggs, Dr.. Witz is reor-
ganizing and widening the pro-
gram of ﬁeld biology to accommo-
date the large inﬂux of biology
majors.

The laboratory, although prac-
tically unknown to Pitt students,
has maintained classes since 1925
with Dr. 0. E. Jennings as its di-
rector. It was rebuilt in 1930 to

, provide a larger number of rooms

and laboratories. The laboratory
was closed to students during the
war period, but was reopened in
1946. Pitt’s ﬁeld lab includes such
subjects as ﬁeld botany, ecology,
zoology, and other classes of in-
terest to biology students.

Gteachers available.

Although only 161 students
graduated from the School of Ed-
ucation in 1947 Hoffman’s office
was able to offer them a total of
1,110 teaching and administrative
positions in elementary or second-
ary schools.

In addition, there were 499 po-
sitions available on the college
level, most of which, however, re.‘
quired at least a masters degree.

Breaking the ﬁgures down, the I

report shows that 343 of the 1110
elementary and secondary posi-
tions were in states other than
Pennsylvania. Forty-six of the po-
sitions were outside the continen-
tal limits of the United States.
Only 22 of the 161 Pitt graduates
took employment outside Pennsyl.
Vania.

In releasing this data, Hoffman
stated that he hopes that students
with the qualiﬁcations will be en-
couraged to go into the ﬁeld of
education.

He warned, however, that
graduates in certain educational
specialties are exceeding the num-

ber of vacancies in these speciali-
ties. Chief among these overcrowd-
ed ﬁelds are boy’s physical educa-
tion and the social sciences.

The ﬁelds with the most oppor-
tunities for employment are girls
physical education, art, music,
mathetmatics, and the physical
sciences.

Under a follow up plan inaug-
urated in July, 1946, the bureau
carries its services beyond mere-
ly placing the Pitt graduates.
Wherever possible, the oﬁice
makes personal checks into the
welfare and progress of the young

Analyzes ‘George W’

Instructor in English

thirtieth season on Thursday,
“George Washington Slept

Here,” a play which has been around for a long time.

The reason for the play’s continuing existence is obvious.
Kaufman and Hart, being smart men, have established a formu-
la for comedy, based upon their sure knowledge a11d faintly

ings into a ridiculous situation;
extract what fun there is for an
audience in Watching the charac-
ters ﬂounder in that situation;
drop in a pathetic scene in which
the characters, under the impact
of trouble, show themselves ap-
pealingly; then, by methods often
frivolous, extricate their charac-
ters and ring down the curtain on
a speech full of nobility. “George
Washington Slept Here,” ﬁts the
formula perfectly.

Certainly the Players’ cast
brought vigor and enthusiasm, and
to spare, to their performance of
their roles in the play. After the
opening scene, when the first un-
easy consciousness of the audience
had passed, the actors had fun,
and the benevolent ﬁrst night au-
dience had fun with them. But
the fun—on both sides of the foot-
lights-—had to come from a will-
ing disregard of the bases of the
pleasure, for fundamentally there
really is not much humor in vio-
lent progresses across a stage, in
the obvious chewing of gum, in the
frequent mention of manure, dry
wells, and disappearing gravel, in
loud expletives designed to shock,
nor in the dumping of garbage on
a stage. The very enthusiasm

which new actors carry to such
actions, unfortunately, forces them
to overdo what is not ve_ry con-
vincing in the ﬁrst place and, so to
lose the illusion of reality upon
which successful theater depends.
The choice of “George Washington
Slept Here” as the ﬁrst play was,
I think, not particularly happy.
Good comedy, though rare, exists
and might have been found for
this occasion.

The whole cast and staff must
be commended for the industry
obvious behind the performance.
The actors had learned their lines,
cues, and business. The leading
characters overplayed their parts

. somewhat, but they must not be

judged too harshly for the misin-
terpretation of characters whom
the playwrights have succeeded in
making only vaguely resemble’ hu-
man beings. Jack Ingrim, as Nor-
man Fuller, for ‘example, sustain-
ed the mannerisms of an aged and
nervous man; yet Fuller, enthus-
iastic purchaser of a Revolution-
ary house, could not have been
much past‘ his mid-forties. In the

plunge well meaning human be-9

drinking scene, however, he, ably 

seconded by Lucille Bodnar, as
Mrs. Fuller, drops the exaggerated
mannerisms for a time, and be-
tween them they produce some
genuine comedy, comedy unfortu-
nately cut short by the scene of
destruction which follows clumsy
device concluding the play, for
which, after all, the actors are not

responsible. William Claypoole
gave a consistent performance as
a droll farmer; he makes as be-
lievable as possible a person who
really never existed in Bucks‘
County. Jackie McKim, as Madge
Fuller, is the charming young
daughter and plays without ‘self-
consciousnee-s the unmotivated
role. John Foerst, with equal poise,
plays the part of Madge’s admirer,
Steve Eldridge, and reappears at
the end of the story without em-
barrassment by the fact that his
re-entrance is never explained.
Josephine Bosco, as Mrs. Douglas,
the neighbor, deserves particular
commendation _for an excellent .bit
of acting which -gives reality to a
type character; she plays a part,
which invites exaggeration, with-
out improper emphasis. Miriam
Cooper and Thomas Ryan handle
their roles well within the limits
of the parts as Kaufman and Hart
wrote them.

The.members of the supporting
cast aid with enthusiasm the situ-
ations into which they are thrust.
Probably the most embarrassing
role in the play is Raymond's, and
Henry Szymanski works hard in
the part, but he can never quite
disguise’ the fact that he is basi-
cally a likable young man, not giv-
en to theft,’ blackmail, or threats
of homicide. One suggestion needs
to be "addressed to the director and
to all the young women who will
play throughout the year in Pitt
Players’ productions: more atten-
tion must be paid to the voices of
the women who speak, in order
to avoid the stridence that comes
into the voices of American wom-
en when they are most eager to
be heard. To sum up, the Players,
have given. a performance which,
though not perfect, indicates tal-
ent, energy, and enthusiasm.
These, properly channeled, will
give many evenings of entertain-
ment to the University.

Brighter Grid Future at Pitt

Pie Traynor, one time Pirate baseball star, ‘turned grid
expei’t recently. long enough to predict that the Panthers
will split even in their remaining home ganies, beating \Vest
Virginia but losing to Penn State.

for a. local radio station, did

his prognosticating at last Week’s' meeting of the Y-Men’s Club.
Penn State got Pie’s vote on the basis of their reserves.

“State is four deep in material”?

he said, “while Pitt has only a
ﬁrst team. This has been the trou-
ble all season. Nobody has push-
ed Pitt around in the ﬁrst half.
They need a second team to meet
those teams who are deep in ma-
terial at every position.”

Traynor, like most Pittsburgh
sports writers, sees a rosier fu-
ture for Pitt football. He feels
that the experience gained by the
gridders this year will prove val-
uable in the coming years.

The erstwhile diamond great
put in a special word of commen-
dation for Mike Milligan. He
characterized Mike as a coach
“who is well thought of and liked
by everyone.”

Harking back to Pitt's future
grid prospects, Pie views this
year’s increased attendance as a
step forward.

“A lot of money was madeat
the gate this season and those
stadium bonds are being paid off,”
he observed. “This money can be
spread around so that the alumni

can encourage more good football
players to come here.”

Despite his interest in the grid
picture, Traynor expressed his
disapproval of the current high
school and college tendency to
emphasize football at the expense
of his first love, baseball.

He, believes that baseball is
needed to maintain school en-
thusiasm in the spring months. In
addition to this it helps “to keep
the young fellows busy doing
something that is constructive to
them.”

Pie attributes scholastic de-em-
phasisof baseball to the fact that
football brings in larger financial
returns.

Let ‘The Wheeling Whip‘
Heave That Apple Around,
In the First Quarter

Three more Saturdays remain before the Panthers pull down the
curtain on what may be the most disastrous season in Pitt history.

'That’s the pessimistic outlook and one which has prevailed through-.

out the season.

Football history, however, abounds with incidents whereby un-
dermanned teams have upset superior opponents. Sometimes upsets
are accomplished by tricky defenses or new offensive formations.

But, mainly, surprise victories are accomplished because the un-

. dermanned team is “up.” An emotionally aroused team is hard to

beat. All too frequently, Pitt has¢

lacked this emotional lift-—this
conﬁdence.
«Too Much Defense
It may come as a surprise to
many that the members of the
team did not intend to lose an-
other game after the Michigan
defeat.
But they have not been aroused
emotionally, and although the
aMinnesota game was an improve-
ment, Pitt has concentrated too
much attention on defense in the
ﬁrst quarter.
Many observers feel that if the

‘ Pitts'went out there with the idea

that they could take the opposi-
tion and were allowed to throw
that apple around in the ﬁrst per-
iod, they might surprise and beat
a stronger foe. -
Must Take More Chances

The players are just a little sur-
prised every Saturday when they
go out there and battle their high-
ly publicized adversaries on even
terms in the ﬁrst quarter.

Why not open up and try to get
the ﬁrst touchdown? It’s dan-
gerous to pass in the vicinity of
your own 20-yard line, but some-

take nearly enough chances for ah
underdog team.

With the Wheeling Whip, Paul‘

Rickards, at fullback the Panthers
have a passer who is not far be-
hind the best we have met this
year. Given the protection, Rick-
ards can really hit the mark.

' I would like to see an all-out
aerial offensive in the ﬁrst quar-
ter against Purdue this Saturday.
Let’s see Rickards start cracking
that whip. ,

Interceptions. Disputed Play
Give Civil B's 20-0 Victory

In one of the‘ weirdest IM games of the year, the Civil B’sv
downed the Metallurgical Seniors, 20-0, on-touchdowns that came.
from two pass interceptions and a disputed pass play. The game was
played Thursday on Trees Field.

Early in the second quarter Joe Ozleski faded back to midﬁeld
and heaved a pass that Stan Thomas took while doing a toe-dance
on the end-zone line. This gave the Civils a 6-point margin.

The Mets protested that Thomas was outside of the end zone,
but the referee ruled he had fallen out aftercatching the ball.

Head Coach Stu Holcomb has
taken the same team that _was
able to win only two games in
1946 and whipped it into the pow-
erful aggregation that is now
averaging better than ﬁve yards
per crack on each running play.

Defensively, the Boilermakers
have nothing to be ashamedof. As
of Friday, the Purdue line had
allowed an average of only 2.16

yards per try. This," against ma-.

jor opposition such as Notre Dame
and Ill.inois.
Strong on Pass Defense

Although Purdue has had to
contend with the nation’s leading
passers, they have eight intercep-
tions to their credit. This is no
mean trick against men like N otre
Dame’s Lujack, Illinois’ Moss, and
Iowa’s Di Marco.

Prior to the start of the season,
the only bright star on Holcomb’s
horizon was his quarterback Bob
DeMoss. Offensively, DeMoss has
lived up to his predictors. He has
pitched eight touchdowns in six
games. ‘

However a brighter star has
ﬂashed across the Lafayette sky.
He is Halfback Harry Szulborski.
The “Pulverizing Pole” is ‘leading
the Big Nine in-yardage gained
through rushing. As of Friday, he
sported a healthy total of 360
yards for a 6.5 yard per try aver-
age.

Milito Picks Up Yards \
‘His running mate, Norbert Ad-

ams is not far behind. "Adams is

ﬁfth in‘ the Western Conference

standings for yardage gained. He:

has a ﬁve yard per try average for
his power running. Both are soph-
omores.

Jack “Crash” Milito does full-
back duty. Milito is good at pick-
ing up thenneededyard and dou-
bles as a defensive standout. His
play has been brilliant defensive-
ly, and his efforts have earned him
a reputation as one of the better
Midwestern linebackers.

Milligan’s Panthers will have
hada week’s rest to prepare for
the coming fray with Purdue. It
is doubtful that even a rested

Panther can cope with the high"

ﬂying Purdue eleven. This does
not look like the week to win an-
other Big Nine game. 0

il M Round-Upi

Phi Kappa successfully protested a game-winning Sigma Chi
safety, thus throwing the National League race into a 4-way tie for
first place. National honors are divided between Sigma Chi, Phi
Kaps, Delts, and Theta Chi.

The protested safety came about when Bill Boyd intercepted a
Sigma Chi pass in his own end zone and was nabbed by Harry
Blair, giving the Sigma Chi’s two points and a 15-13 win.

Regular season play in the National loop was scheduled to end
November 3, but postponements and protests have necessitated the
playing 01‘ replaying of four addi-¢ '

tional contests, the action is
scheduled to begin today, and
should break up the four-ply dead-
lock.

Lambs Tie Eps

Last Wednesday at Shadyside,
in a game that should never have
been started, the Pi Lambs and
the Phi Eps battled to a ‘scoreless
deadlock.

The ﬁeld was a sea of mud and
as late as two minutes before the
start of the farce, rain pelted the
gridiron.

A slippery pigskin made the
passing attacks of both teams fu-
tile. The footing was so treacher-
ous that most of the running plays
were stopped without a hand be-
ing laid on the ball carrier.

Decision Halts TD

With only one minute to‘ go
Mark Chernoff of the Phi Eps
ﬂipped to Irv Girmeise in the ﬂat.
He lateralled to Zola Gold who
appeared to go over for a score.

’When the referee placed the ball
on the one-inch line, the Phi Eps
raised a tremendous howl. Their
bitterness increased when they
failed to put the ball over.

Paced by the accurate passing
of Dick Johns, SAE had little trou-
ble in trouncing an outclassed
SAM six, 26-0, Thursday on Trees
quagmire. '

Kalin Stops Drive
Rolling right from the opening

whistle, the winners drove down
to the enemy ten in the first series
of downs. Their drive was stall-
ed, however, when Art Kalin,
SAM back, intercepted on the two.

Kalin and his teammates didn’t
hold the ball long. On the next
play, a pass from their end zone,
they watched unhappily as Don
O’Rourke evened up the intercep-
tions and did just the opposite
with the score.

‘Not satisﬁed with only a touch-
down, O’Rourke added the seventh
point with a completion to Bob
Lutes. ‘

Johns Completes Passes

Now Johns started to work.
Nearly every time he sent a spiral
in the direction, of an intended re-
ceiver, that-intended receiver be-
came a ball carrier.

Three of those “strikes” result-
ed in touchdowns. Lutes caught
the ﬁrst and the second. He went
all the way by himself after grab-
bing the first one, but required a
little aid on the latter.

Phil Sweet came to the rescue
by taking Lutes’ lateral and going
the remaining distance. The third
was garnered by Courtney Evans
on a slightly terriﬁc catch.

The whole business ended with
the SAE’s needing their ﬁngers,
toes, and then some, to compute
their total. A

it

Maxine Wood, prize—winning 10-
cal playwright, has taken up the
battle against racial prejudices in
her latest play, “On Whitman

Avenue.”

The Pitt YMCA & YWCA So-
cial Inquiry Group is sponsoring
a trip to the preview of “On
Whitman Avenue” Tuesday, Nov.
11, at 8:30 p. m. in the Theresa
Kaufmann Auditorium, Irene
Kaufmann Settlement. Both Miss
Woodand Canada Lee. who star-
red in the Broadway production,
will attend the preview.

Miss Wood was awarded the
Otto H. Kahn award for play-
writing in 1928 upon her gradua-
tion from Carnegie Tech Drama
School.

Since then she has written many
short stories for leading maga-
zines and several prize-winning
novels. At present she has a new
play ready for production.

Miss Wood has also directed
plays at the Children’s Theatre,
the YlVl & WHA and other little
theatre groups.

In the play “On Whitman Ave-
nue” she shows how racial preju-
dice and real estate greed force a
negro war heo and his family out
of a white neighborhood, back to
the hideous slums of a lvlidwestern
black ghetto.

The play has won acclaim from
critics for the boldness and can-
didness with which it is presented.

Subsequent presentations of “On
Whitman Avenue” will be given
Wednesday through Saturday,
Nov. 12-15. Free tickets for Tues-
day’s performance are available
at the YMCA, 804 Cl, and the
YWCA 1204 Cl.

Tickets for other performances

are also on sale at prices of 500.

for students and $1 for adults.

Two years before the Constitu-
tion of the United States was
adopted, the University held
classes in a three room log house
in the downtown district. Today
it houses a student enrollment of
approximately 25,000 in 16 build-
ings.
