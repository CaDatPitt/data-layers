On March 1 Dr. Alfred Moye.
formerly Dean of Student Affairs.
was given the title of Vice-Chan-
cellor of Student Affairs. Since
that time. there has been a re-
shuffling of other positions and
titles in the Student Affairs Office.

William Markus. who had been
Director of Student_ Activities and
Assistant Dean of Student Affairs.
will now serve as full-time assis-
tant to Move. At this time. there
has been no decision by the Board
of 'l‘rustees as to_what his new
title will be.

It‘ was decided that Markus’
double position encompassed too
many responsibilities for one per-
son. Now Markus will direct his
efforts in the general area of ‘Stu-
dent Affairs. The Counseling Cen-
ter, Office of Residence Life,
Health Center, Veterans Adminis-
tration and Placement Center, in
addition to Student Activities and
others, will come under his full-
time duties.

Daniel Meloro. who served as
an Associate Director ..of Student
Activities under Markus since
coming to the University one year
ago." will now assume the position
of Director of Student Activities.
Meloro is a graduate of Carnegie-
Mellon University with a Bache-
lor of Arts Degree in Economics.

As an associate director. Me-

loro was an advisor to fraterni-
ties. the Student Government Pro-
gramming Committee. the Stu-
dent Union Board, film and gen-
eral programming groups. and
was also involved in the forming
of major university concert con-
tracts.

Now, as director of the office,
he will be responsible for.all staff
advisors, but will still have a
heavy hand in programming. Me-
loro’s former. position will not be
filled-’-“We were not ordered to
cut-back on our staff, but we feel

we can try to trim down. We are
considering re-structuring staff
assignments,” Meloro said.

Meloro explained that. since
his former position will not be

filled the duties associated with’
_ that job will be re—channeled un-

der another advisor.

Although the reshuffling of posi-
tions in the Student Affairs Uf-
fice had been considered for quite
some time, the final decisions
were pending the Chancellor's ap-
proval. Markus and Meloro as-
sumed their new duties on July 1.

  Sign New Pay Contract

by JIM HOSEK
A two-week strike by L;niyersi-
ty carpenters ended Thursday with
an agreement on a new contract

which assures pay increase retro— '

activity to June 1. 1972.

The new contract affects about
75 Pitt carpenters. according to
Bob Argentine. secretary-treasur-
er of the Carpenters District
Council of Western Pennsylvania.

It calls for the University to’

pay retroactively a 50¢ per hour
wage increase that should have
gone into effect June 1, 1972, he
said.

"This." said Argentine." “was
in line with a three year agree-
ment made in 1970. calling for
50c per hour raises in 1971 and
1972. -

"The problem was that the
University honored the 1971 pay
increase but not last year's."

Although eight laid-off carpen-

ters who picketed the past two ‘

week-s will be receiving the retro-
active pay increases, they will not
be working for the University,

“unless they’re called back at a’

later time,” said Argentine.

if they are called back. he
said. they "will be a part of the
new three-year contract just work-
ed out between the university and
the carpenters" district council."

He said that this agreement

status of sole legal bargaining,»

by JOHN AMSON CAPITMAN

Faculty at many colleges and
universities across the country
have either already formed unions
or are in the process of doing so.

Pitt is no exception with at K

least two groups. the American
Association of University Profes-
sors tAAUPi and the Pitt Pro-

the position of recognized agent
in the event that the faculty de-

Slowdown Jeopardizes Law School

by MONICA A. CIROCCO

A slowdown in the construc-
tion of the new law school niay
jeopardize the schools accredita-
tion.

The school, according to Law
School Dean W. Edward Sell, is
up for accreditation this Septem-
ber. The accreditation of the pre-
sent law school facilities, he
said, is contingent upon the
amount of work done on the new
law school building. -

Sell said that plans for the new
law school should meet accredita-
tion standards. -

The Gendoco (Jonipany has
completed
foundation phase. but no com‘-

the excavation and.

pany has yetbeen named to fin-
ish the project. Sell is hopeful
that work on the project will re-
sume before the University is
inspected in September.

Vice-chancellor of Operations
Joseph Dutton.said that the bids
are too high and the General
State Authority (GSA) in Har-
risburg is working on ways to-cut
back costs.

He maintained that work "has
not stopped." but the allocation
for the school by the state legis-
lature is a fixed amount and ad-
ditional funds have been cut off.
Bids are only good for 45 days

‘because of price escalation.

4 Dutton denied howeverfthat the

 

slowdown will affect the scliools
accredidation.

Hunt Martin of the Physical
Plant Department stated tliat the
school isn’t being worked on be-
cause no award has_ been granted,
but they are hoping for one soon
since most of the alternatives are
not good. “Redesign, which is one
option, would take too much
time,” he said.

In reaction ‘o the accredida-
tion runior. l\/IartLn stated: "There
have been rumors about the law
schools accredidation for sev-
eral years. especially its library.
but it hasfalways managed. The

V major point is that we are doing

everything we can to get the job
moving forward." ~

bargaining unit (those ‘who are
members of the union, and cover-
ed by its contracts) must be de-
termined by the Commonwealth
Labor Relations Board.

in order for that decision to

be made. however. one third of
_the faculty members must fill out
a card stating their preference
for or against unionization for the
bargaining agent.
i Finally, after the bargaining
unit has been determined, a gen-
eral balloting of all faculty will
be held, where decision concern-
ing unionization and bargaining
agent be made.

Dr. Ray Richman. president of
the Pitt AAUP and Graduate
School of Public and International
Affairs iGSPlAi professor. ex-
plained that his group has not yet
made a decision concerning the
delineation of the bargaining unit
though the group is "determined
to get these sorts of questions
worked out. and move as quickly
as possible toward unionization.

Dr. Van Beck Hall, president
of the PPU, and professor of his-—
tory, said that the bargaining
unit should include all faculty
(excluding the medical faculties),
graduate teaching and research
assistants, and librarians.

The two faculty groups. as well
as any others which may decide
to compete for the position of
bargaining agent. have to indi-
vidually gain the support of one
third-of the faculty and after a

An advantage of the mainte-=.

Argentine.

The agreement with the Uni-

versity was reached two days be-

Richman and Hall both deny,‘
however, that there are “strong
grievances or significant opposi-
tions” between the two groups.

Hichman explained that -the
major difference between PPU
and AAUP lies in "our respect

for the traditional relationship

Body-bui/ding Bicycling Gains Populaly

by RITA VITOLO

In 1971. more bicycles were sold
throughout the world than cars.

In that year. the Schwinn Bi-
cycle Company. the only Ameri-
can bicycle manufacturer. had
sold out a year's supply by May.

Businesswas so good for the He-
cycle Bicycle Exchange. a deal-
er and repair outfit formerly lo-
cated in Oakland. that there is no
more business. Completely sold
out within three months last
summer. they have one bicycle
in stock and no plans to re—open.

Part of this interest in bicycling
stems from the fact that it is good
exercise, as well as a means of
transportation both cheaper and
cleaner than the gasoline engine.

As one rider commented while
chain'ing his bike in front of
Langley Hall: "I couldttake the
bus in from the North Side. but
I hate to wait for it and I ‘really
get a kick out of people saying

.-W. \ ..~

,_h._;§ ; -

 

GROWING IN POPULARITY

 

‘Hey. that‘s a really good—Iooking
bicycle" I had another bike. but
it got ripped off. right from this
rack. So I went back and bought
a ten-speed and a bigger chain."

Although the fuel shortage has
made owning a bicycle both ec-
ologically and economically sound.
don't think that it will be easy
or cheap to buy one.

Schwinn dealer Steve Kraynick
of Centre Avenue suggests that or-
ders be placed at least two m_onths
in advance. The same is'true for
imported bicycles. according to
the manager of a Squirrel Hill
outfit that handles imported bikes
exclusively.

The price of a bicycle either
imported or domestic can range
from a $66.95 Schwinn to a more
than $450, fifteen-speed Marvel.
Because bicycle manufacturers
essentially assemble a collection
of components—frame, brakes, gear
system——and then stamp the com-
pany brand name on the finished

    
  

  

are both bicycling and bicycle thiev-

ery on Pitt's campus. More and more, students are relying on “the

old pedals” for transportation.

  llﬂlllllli A PAlll(,|ll(i PROBLEM?

‘Now AVAILABLE WITH

bike, an imported bike is not ne-
cessarily a more expensive bicy-
cle.

However. both dealers stressed
that a top—quality bike should have
a lightweight frame (20-35 pounds I.
fast-acting and dependable brakes.
and a gear mechanism that makes
for the easiest pedalling that one
desires.

Gear systems typically are avail-
able in three. five. or ten-speed
models. l<‘ifteen—speed bikes are
relatively uncommon and expen-
sive. For some customers. the
manager of Velocipede explained.
the gear system determines the
quality of the bike; Campangolo
brand gears for example are gen-
erally regarded as the best on the
market.

When asked which kind of bike
he would buy. however. he ans-
wered in a typical bike-freak
manner: ‘'1 wouldn"t just buy a
bike. not even one ol‘these. I'd
have it custom-made. But there‘s
no bicycle shop in Pittsburgh that
can doit."

What the city of Pittsburgh
does have, however, is a recent-
ly completed bike route, known
as the Highland-Schenley Bike-
way.

The trail begins in Oakland.
near the Cathedral. crosses Pan-
ther Hollow to Schenley Park and
continues through Squirrel Hill.
Doubling back through Frick and
Mellon Parks the trail then passes
near Chatham College and the
East Liberty Mall. ending at the
Highland Park Reservoir.

Use of the bikeway is free_; and
although a bicycle license is not
required in the City. the bike must
be registered and equipped
with lights and reflectors for
night riding.

To guarantee the safety of this
investment, Velocipede offers an
insurance policy that covers “loss

of or damage to” the insured
property. BUT AS Velocipede’s
owner described it, “There’s no
way you’re going to prevent that
bike from being stolen, when
you’re not with it. If he has the
right tools, and enough time,
there’s no way any chain’s going to
stop a thief from taking your
bike. The best way- to keep your
bike from being stolen is’ to take
it to bed with you.”

lO¢ Check Cashing Fee
Instituted by University

by DEBBIE POPP

A 10c fee will now be charged
on checks cashed by the Univer-
sity. The policy began July 1.

This fee is another example of
the cut back in student services
to meet the 6% reduction in the
University’s budget.

Joseph Dutton. Vice Chancellor
of Operations believes the lot-
charge will cover the costs of two
members of the controllers staff
tending the cashiers window.

For several years students and
staff. particularly those from out
of town. have benefited from the
free service which permitted
cashing checks up to $25 a week in
the Cathedral and Scaife Hall.

Discussing the upcoming fee.
one teller in the Cathedral facili-
ty stated she would go .some
place else to cash checks.

This is what the University is
anticipating. Besides saving tell-
ers’ time, the University will not
have the expense of tracing the
five to nine % of the checks that
bounce.

Dutton feels that students will
turn to commercial banks because
of the new tree checking offered.

However. in dealing with local
banks. students will find two ob-
stacles not encountered within
the University.

Of the three major banks in
Oakland one requires an initial
deposit of $75 while the other
requires a $50 balance.

The third bank prefers an ini-
tial deposit of $10-15. depending
on students to deposit more later
inthe term.

A second obstacle is the delay

of two to five days for. out of
state and out of town checks to
clear. The University avoids this
delay by using its own bank cre-
dits to collect the money.

The University may continue
to draw students despite the new
charge, by continuing to cash
checks on Saturday.

The IOC collected on students
checks will be put into a separ-
ate account and be considered an
auxiliary enterprise.

student Government has met
with the University to discuss
postponing the lee until October
when more students would be
aware of the change.

A marathon fund-"raising drive
aimed at bringing in $100.000 for
the financially ailing Point Park
College (PPC) last week netted
only $14.000. _ _

Although the drive fell $86,000
short of its goal, Acting PPC
President John V. Hopkins, call-
ed the drive a sign of the stud-
ents’ “exuberant” interest in the
school. ‘

The financial problems of the
college originated at the end of
l\/lay when it was unable to meet
its monthly payroll or to make

‘state mortgage pay‘ments that
’ amounted to $298,000. 0

Since that time. pressure has

‘ been taken off the college because

there has been a promise of a new
mortgage extension and a willing-

" ness of employes to accept par-

tial payment of salaries.

On the floor of the Senate, he
warned that if the President per-
sisted in the air war, he would
have to bear full responsibility
for the paralysis of the federal
government which could result.

What is to be learned from these
events which was overshadowed
by the John Dean testimony?

It appears that President Nixon.
although he has agreed to a com-
promise bombing halt for August
15, is still unwilling to co-oper-
ate with Congress. After the Wat-
ergate disclosures, he had tried
to reconcile with the Representa-
tives with changed moderation in

I some domestic policies.

Yet he has not yielded to the
people’s will in decisions concern-
ing the war in Indochina in the
past, and now is unyielding to the
Senators and Congressmen. This
could easily serve as a catalyst
for bringing impeachment pro-
ceedings against the President.

It also appears now that both
Nixon and Senator
Hugh Scott are bidding for nom-
inations to be included in a re-
vised edition of Profiles in Cour-
age.

were portrayed because they
chose to dissent from popular op-
inion and follow their conscience
in efforts to preserve the funda-
mental_ ideoldgy upon which the
nation was founded.

President Nixon and Senator
Scott have also chosen to ignore
the popular opinion, which has
been to halt the bombing, but it
is unlikely that their efforts will
preserve our country’s fundamen-
tal ideologies. Instead, their
ideals will serve to further divide
the Administration from Congress,
and the people from the govern-
ment. ~

The action in Washington last
week does provide for encourage-
ment and victory, even though the
President vetoed the bill and Con-
gress quickly sustained.

It was the most important piece
of anti-war legislation yet to
clear both houses of Congress for
over a decade. It was the first
to_ halt all oppropriations to the
war in Indochina.

This alone demonstrates a shift
in Congressional values and sug-
gests a new trend for the future.

In the Senate, it is heartening
to realize that only 11 out of 100
Senators, representing every state

in the Union. have dessented to .

halt the bombing in Cambodia.
This also suggests a trend.

The most encouraging sign.
however, is that in these confus-
ing times, when Americans have
come to be distrustful of people
in high places. there are some
elected officials that are fervent-
ly working for the people and
their ideals. ‘

LETTER  

Dear Ms. Sexton,

Mary Winter and-her Women
Concerned for the Unborn Child
must be joking if she really ex-
pects the students at this Univer-
sity to believe her half-true and
ill-researched “facts."

When talking about the rela-
tive safety of abortion, Mrs.
Winter should obtain something
a bit more up-to-date than Dr.

Hutchinson's I 1971‘ speech which

Column and a Half

by JOHN METCALFE

Once again it is July. and once again. before
the month is properly started. the Fourth of July
is upon us. Almost everywhere there will be dis-
plays of the paraphernalia of patriotism. Flags
will be visible at every turn. Fifes and drums will
stir the blood of the most torpid; if they can af-
ford it. the musicians will be dressed in the style
of 1776. Inspiring motifs will abound.

The tops of flagpoles, the seals of Presidents,
indeed the very coins in our pockets, will all display
the sacred bird, the bald eagle. -

The bird has been maligned. In his prime. he is
not really bald; indeed. his head is as throughly
covered as yours or mine. It only happens to be
covered with white feathers, while. the rest of his
body is a rather showy bronze. Unless elderly or
very sick. the eagle is never bald.

The eagle is everywhere. our national totem.
and in every city newspaper the story appears that

the eagle was not the first choice as the Ameri-

can national bird. Benjamin Franklin led the op-
position. (Do not tell your friends that you read it
first in the Pitt News. They will think you are ig-
norant, and suspect that you read nothing but this
excellent journal.)

Mr. Franklin never said a word to disparage
the eagle. but some of his friends did. He did not ob-
ject when they claimed that the bald eagle was
sometimes inclined to‘ eat carrion. to scavenge
after his betters. as it were; or to reap the fruits
of accidental death. He never refuted the claim
that the nest of the eagle is the most untidy thing to
be found in all of Christendom. He merelyput forth
the claim of the bird he liked. ’

The bird Ben Franklin liked was the tlirkey.

He did not like it as food. for in those days there
were no holidays in November. He admired it for

its character; it was elusive. devious. devilish
hard to catch. and damned well delicious once
caught; in a word. it was American.

He argued eloquently. but he lost. The Eagle-
hawks of his day neatly defeated the Turkey-doves.
It was a pity.

In this troubled year in this troubled country
we would be well served by the turkey as a national
symbol. The turkey of today is hardly the turkey of
Colonial times, but this is hardly the nation of those
happy days. ’

The fast. cantankerous and tasty bird can still
be found in Pennsylvania in its original form. One
of our finer whiskies is named: for it. But. as we
rarely meet Ben Franklin. we rarely see the wild
turkey- Our politicians have changed. and so have
most of our turkeys. Still. there is an argument in
favor of the original proposition that the turkey be
our national bird.

The turkey. in its current avatar. is an aston-
ishingly stupid bird. It has been interbred and

crossbred and inbred in the interest of meat to the ;

point where it is too stupid to find food which is not
already in its mouth. It has been bred for white
meat to the point that its breast overbalances it.
and it cannot walk properly. Long ago it forgot how
to fly. Again the white meat. Indeed. all turkeys
are. the product of artificial insemination. They
are so fat and so stupid that they can no longer re-

. produce themselves in the ordinary fashion.

Forget the bald eagle. It is nearly extinct any-
way, and nobody who lives near it likes it very
much. Some of its neighbors rent helicopters to
kill it. -

Back to the turkey. It will serve as a national
symbol as we waddle our impotent way to the in-
inevitable Thanksgiving ahead of us.

referred to patients who had un-
dergone curettage and saline in-
jection abortions. Anyone can go
to Falk Library and get the lat-
est statistics about abortion. In
the May, 1973Iissue of Obstetrics
and Gynecology, Dr. Joseph J.~
Rovinsky of the Mount Sinai Hos-
pital in New York City writes
on page 794:

“In general, gregnancy term-
ination by suction evacuation
was '50 times safer than ob-
stet_ric delivery; by curettage,
10 times safer.”

Suction evacuation is the meth-
od used by Women’s Health Ser-
vices (the abortion clinicat 625
Stanwix Street).

In a 1971 article in the same
journal, Rovinsky had stated that
early abortion was more danger-
ous than delivery. He has found,
as Mary Winter should, that the
safety factor has become much
greater since the days when abor-
tion was first legalizedin some
states. Incidentally, there has
been no research done an where

in the world that compares the
sterility" producing effects of
medical abortion with those
same effects from carrying a
pregnancy to term to see which
is greater. ‘

At this point, any claims that
medical abortions produce great-
er risks of sterility than child-
birth are unfounded.

Why Mrs. Winter and her
friends even bother to quote sta-
tisticssabout the risks of abortion

- is beyond comprehension. Anti-

abortion groups oppose the use
of oral contraceptives and intrau-
terine. devices as well as morn-
ing-after.'pills_because, in their
minds, these things cause abor-
tions. Their opposition to abor-
tion, then, stems from moral,
rather than medical, considera-
tions. They would be against
abortion if it were as safe as
brushing your teeth.

The proposed Human Life
Amendment is a thinly-veiled
attempt to impose on all of so-
ciety the views of a rather small

group of religious fanatics. The .

proposed amendment will not
stop abortions, just safe ones.
According to Dr. Christopher
Tietze, research hasshown that
7092 of the legal abortions done
for New York. City residents

would have been done anyway-

under illegal, and probably dan-
gerous, circumstances. Such an
amendment would ban the use
of birth control pills and intrau-
terine devices‘ and, more impor-
tantly, would literally mur-
der, maim, cripple, or render
sterile thousands upon thousands
of women. That is the only ef-
fectit would have. I

By sending a postcard to your
congressman and senators in
Washington opposing the amend-
ment, you can make sure that ._
the lives of vast numbers of
women are not sacrificed on the
alter of religious fanaticism.

received, topped the charts. play-

Then came the Broadway play.
The play was well-received, put

money.

"And now the film." as the ads
so proclaim, just in case there's
anyone left who hasn't had his
fill of the rock opera Jesus Christ,
Superstar (with the original
soundtrack album to boot). But of

word) relevant. The film version.

yet disappointing in its failure
to fully live up to the potential
of the "Superstar..”

There are some evocative scenes
in the film: the overture. show-
ing a laughing troupe ‘preparing
for a timeless ritual; Roman
guards dressed in hard hat type
helmets, GI fatigues and boots.
and surfers‘ shirts; the black-
shrouded Pharisees on their perch-

 es. like so many crows in a cage.

Filmed in the Israeli desert in-
stead of “Biblical” sets, Super-
star blends Scripture and pop cul-
ture in an absorbing combination
unlimited by time or space. Cos-
tumes, sets, music and charac-
ters all enhance this aura of eter-
nity.

Except one. and there’s the chief
flaw. ‘

In older Biblicalflicks, the char-
acter of Jesus was never photo-
graphed. Directors shied from giv-
ing him a face. In Superstar, Dir-

ector, Norman Jewison has taken

care not to give JC any interpre-
tation of personality. This is the
guy who has the Pharisees scared.

‘ ‘ Judas worried. and the people in

an uproar. but the.most subver-
sive thing has allowed to do is
give one power handshake.

Ted Neeley, who . plays JC,
cannot be totally to blame for this
lifeless, emotionless Christ; he
might have tried to move his fa-
cial muscles once in a while. He
resembles the Jesus presented in

a third grade catechism. Even after
he’s beaten, scourged, etc., he
hardly perspires.
It appears that Jewison copped
_out in refusing to make JC the
dynamic.

original rock opera. Some of those
lyrics are pretty strong stuff; but
then. so is the Bible. and look
what they did to that.

‘Another problem with Super-
star is that many of its scenes
were not staged or photographed
as well as they could have been.
In such a dramatic opera. there
are many possibilities. but only
Mary Magdalene‘s "I Don‘t
Know How To Love Him" is
truly memorable. The staging of
the “big" number—"Supérstar“—
seems to have been grabbed right
off the Broadway stage. It was
very effective there. but on the
wide screen it looks like a re-
run of the old TV show Shindig.‘
The cinematic possibilities were
endless. but unused.

The movie’s two -chief saving
graces are Carl Anderson (Judas
on the road -and here) and Yvonne
Elliman (Mary Magdalene through
all three versions). Anderson pro-
vides the forcefulness and dy-
namics needed, while Elliman
epitomizes; the tenderness and
humanness missing elsewhere.
