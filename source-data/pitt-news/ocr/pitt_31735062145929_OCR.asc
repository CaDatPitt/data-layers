Walter Dunn, sporting editor of  ,
“The Reading “Tribune”, has written  
the’Alumni Secretary for some rem’-J 
iniscences of Dr. R. c. (“Dick”) Hob- 
litzell, whowas well known for many   LL
years in Major League baseball cu; ‘ [7 
cles, and who is well known in Rea'.d- - .0 '
ing. This letter carried the mind of
the Alumni Secretary back about. 16 ‘
years when Hoblitzell was prominent
-in W.  ,1-2. activities, athletic eiia,
otherwise. before he ibiossoiiied forth
as a Big League baseball“ star. He.re’s
what We said in part: ‘ V

“Hoblitzell entered Pitt from Ma.’-' ~
rietta College, Marietta, Ohio, where
he had performed on the football and
baseball teams. He V was a -close
friend of Dr. s. B. Ralston of the W. V
U-LP-_S'q11ad, and ‘Doc’, as Ralston was
called, convinced Dick that hisplace
was at the University. He entered in
the fall of ’07 and was a candidate. for 
end. He got in many important games
and was quite a star, his specialty be-
ing drop kicking. Hobby could drop
kick them over from almost any an.-
glefrom any part of the ﬁeld. When
we needed to punt We would simply
Send Dicl: back and let _l_1_im drop _l_:i,ck.-' V
In 0119 i111I>Ortant~ game he missed one '
by inches from the center of the ﬁeld.‘

“Hobby did, not play baseball for
the University, because he signed up
_ L in the
spring Just, after thefootball season ,
ended, although he ﬁnished his first 
year’s work before he got .into base- ' .
ball. He was an exceptionally good
student and was a great favorite of
Dean Friesell, who has since followed 0 ‘ '
his career with a great deal of inter.
est. As I recall, the first minor league
ball he played was at Reading, and.
later on he went to Wheeling. From
that’ time on he gradually went up

landed in the

  

higher and eventually

major leagues, .
“Dick was one of the ﬁnest, well

balanced fellows we ever had at the

University. He was very popular

with the professors in the Dental

S<.3h.001. and they recognized him as an

earnest fellow who would be a credit‘

‘to his profession. He was very con.

  Oi _Devil Stories

I A very interesting recent P'11'b_1iCa'.
tion by Maximilian J. Rudwin,_ Ph.
D., Assistant Professor of_ Modern
Languages of the Unive-r‘sity,4'-is his
collection of; twenty “D-evil Stories.”
These have been carefull-‘y "selected
and .editedJ_ with ‘an introduction and
critical notes by .the{ la-\1th01V ,
The Dawn is an old character in
literature, perhaps, he is ‘was old T’r-‘=15
literature itself. . To illustrate his im-
portance in the ‘literatures of the
world, “Devil Stories’? is not ,.o1_11=y
the best. -butTalso_ the only book of
its kind; ‘It has, -therefore, an inter-
est and a value’ all its own. ,‘ * .
The book is well suited for class-
room work. in.‘ the .tea.ch'ing’ _o§l3_ the
short story, not only as an illustra-
tionT"o-2 the persistent and permanent
appeal of the. Devil to the xgreatest
fiction’ writers of all ages. and . all
languages, but also as_ aT;demons'tra-
tion of the various ‘T aspects under
“which a given subject has been treat-
ed by different VVI'llte1‘S in. d,iffer,ent
countries at. different periods. For

 

better suited than‘ any other char-
acter in literature. ,

The introd1‘1.c:tion’.presents‘ in an
outline form the evolution of "the
idea. of the Devil in the various
stages of the. 3 history T. of lite-rature,
while the comments on each story at
the -end of the book aimto show, not
only the origin" of thestory, but al-
so the process‘ by which it has been
brou;gTht- to the form in which it is
presented. .The'In-dex to the critical
part of the ’-book will be helpful to

into the subject.’ , T Q ‘,

That western _.civi_lizatio'n has failed
in its attempt to apply Christianity is T
the admission which has to be made
by present-day religious leaders in for-
eign missionary ﬁelds, according to
L. S. ’ Cotrell, traveling secretary of
the Student Volunteer Movement,
speaking before the Student Forum in
the Y. M. C. A. but Tuesdayevening,
February 29. “There is a great differ-
ence; .t.he,speaker said,’ ‘ﬁbetween the
original and the modern conception of
the missionary’s task.” - '

The early missionaries; among

them the first Student Volunteers,
were certain that their message and
the culture which they. carried with
them were7_the only right ones. The
spirit of idealism which pervaded the
movement at the time was fostered
by the opposition of educational -auth-
orities and the necessity of--meeting
in secret "at manyof the American col-
leges. This strong conﬁdence in their
own beliefs resulted in a powerful en-
thusiasm among 'th‘eTpioneers in the
foreign ﬁeld. . ’, -T  T '
, The younger religious leaders, how-
ever, according to Mr. Cotrell, “go” out
Tmore in-‘the spirit of yTs_eekers for
light." They seek to present-the story
of Christ, for study rather thanto con-
vince ‘ students that anyone. idea is
correct. The driving. force of the
modern moveincnt is no ‘longer abso-,
lute faith in the truth of the Western.
form. of Christianity, .enthusiasm de-
pending rather upon ‘the example. set
byjthose men who are now considered
martyrs. T  - T T

has changed. too. The ﬁeld which has
never been touched by the. churchhas.
become. limited almost

ters, so that the worlg has become
morohiglily specialized and callswfor
experts in many dines, including agri-
culture, medicine, e.ngineering. com-

merce and education. ,

-. ~Rec0rds F311  Both,‘Meet_s—Victory Over Case, 41-27-

Lose to Cleveland “Y,” 4'4-Z3,-Team to Swim Navy on

Saturday

.In their second meet of the season
-last Friday Pitt's tank stars proved
in little too fast for the lads from
‘Case,.defeating them by the score. 41
to: 29. This was the ﬁrst defeat in
20 years administered by a Pitt team

. to a squad coached by Harry G-
Stevens. The Panthers captured the
"four-man relay race, four other ﬁrts
and four second places, while Case
won three ﬁrst and“ three second
-places. ' Many new records for the
Case pool were established. ‘Abrams
of Case, plunged 60 ft. in 18 seconds.
and his teammates, Hester and Nor-
wood, hung up two more records when
they swam the 200-yard free-style and
"'-the 60-yard backstroke in 2 min. 30 1-5
see. and 40 4-5 sec., respectively. Pitt’s
;share of record smashing was taken
’_-care of by Brodie, who swam the
‘breast-stroke .i-n 1 min. 19 2-5 sec., and

‘  V byilssteele, who broke the 40-yard free
- style, swimming the distance in 20 1-5
.:sec.--and tied the record forthe 100-
. yard free style, 60 4-5. sec. Steele was
also‘ high point scores, making two
aﬁrst and being a memberof the win-
ning relay team. Captain Kerns,
‘Brodie, and Lacesnhlso scored well
2, " for Pitt. Abrams, Heste, and Nor-
woodwon laurels for Case. -

‘ .. ' Clleveland Y Too Strong.
When the team faced _the Cleveland
"Y” swimmers last Saturday,hPitt’s
nat-ators were called upon to over-
come obstacles.

 

They ’ fought  hard, _

but in the end they were compelled to‘
bow to a team that had seve_ral na-
tionally and internationally known
swimmers. One of whom is Walker
the only white man in history.to swim
across Lake Erie. He won the 220-
yard free style and was a member of
the relay team. Another is Weston-
Kimball, who lowered the time in the
ﬁfty-yard dash by four-ﬁfths of,a sec-

‘ond, clipped off one second in the 100-

yard dash, and swam on the relay
team. Kimball is one of the foremost
rivals of Johnny Weismull-er, national
champion, and will probably be a.
member of the Yankee Olympic team.
These two ‘men were largely respon-
sible for the 44 to 23 defeat suffered
by Pitt. Gluck, of Pitt, succeeded in
winning the. plunge, while’ Brodie, a
Freshman, won the 100-yard breast
stroke, the only other ﬁrst captured
by Pitt. _  .

A pleasing ‘feature of the Cleveland,
trip was the welcome given to_ the
team by’Alumni residingin the Ohio
city. Dr. Firestone, Dent. 720, and
Miss Josephine Muller, «Ed. ’21, were
on hand to see tlie Case meet. At the
Y1 were Eddie George, Col. ’23, H. E.
Reppert, Ec. ’23, Clifton I. Rust, Col.

at Tree’s Gym. Theﬁnal score was

lead at the initial whistle and before
the first quarter was ended held a
margin that placed them out"of reach
of the visitors. While the Pitt guards
were holding the Westminster girls
to four ﬁeld goals, the local forwards
romped away with eleven from the
ﬁeld. Westminster was far more ef-
fective from the foul line with 9 out
or 11, than was Pitt who succeeded in
scoring the same number out of 20 at-
tempts, Withthe game out‘of dan-
ger, Coach McClenahan substituted a
new teamwhich continued to hold the
visitors at bay. Muter with ﬁve ﬁeld

Pennsylvania's ' Thirtieth‘ Annual
Relay Race Carnival will this year be
ﬁner‘ than ever." Cambridge Univer-

sity, England, has sent word that they
will be represented. R. Bristowe,
the captain of the Cambridge team,
wrote that as yet they had not‘ decid-
ed on -what distance they will choose.
It is probable-, however, that they will
decide on the two mile distance/as
they have in college, Mountain, ex-
champion half miler of England; and
Lowe, both of whom ‘have run the half
mile in lminute 55 seconds. It is
also said that Griﬁiths who won the
British half mile championship last
July is at Cambridge. If he is there,
Cambridge should have a wonderful
two" mile relay team. Ca bridge will
compete in one of the m dley relay
championships on Friday, April 25th,
the; ﬁrst ‘day of the meeting. ,This
means that their greatathlete, Abra-
hams, will accompany the team.‘ Abra-
hams has don_e 9 4/5 seconds for 100
yards, 21 4/5 seconds for the 220
yards, 49 3/5 seconds for the quarter

  NEXT FRAT EVENT

After a week's rest, the fraternity
track teams will swing into action
again with the medley relay race to-
morrow and Friday afternoons. Five
men teamswill compete, two men to
run one lap of theindoor track, two
men to run two laps, and one man
to run three laps. As a baton is to be
passed, it will be necessary for the
members of each team to report‘ to-
gether. Because of the limited facili-
ties, the various teams will not run‘
in competition but will run against
time. . F .

The way in which the Greeks have
been training for the medley certainly
indicates that the - spirited competi-

 

 

tion of the ﬁrst two events will con»

tinue in the third event, and We are
led to believe that last year’s record
time will fall. ‘
Kappa. Sigma won the medley race
last year in the fast time. of 2 min, 47

ta followed closely behind in 2 min.

Cambridge-Oxford, Harvard-Yale me’ t
last July ‘and is one of the greatest
track athletes ‘in the .world. Penn-
sylvania has also invited Eric Liddell,
of Edinboro University,.Scot_land, the
British 100 yards and 220 yards cham-
pion, to compete at the carnival. Lid-
dell holds the British records for the
above distance at 9 7/10 seconds -and
21 :3/5 seconds respectively. If he
accepts, his meeting with thebest of
our college sprinters will "A be of the
keenest interest. . “

The University of Havana, Cuba, is
sending u.p' a. team tothe . Carnival,
Cuba is not strong in track athletics
and theyiwill be put in a class race.
Occidental College of the Paciﬁc
Slope, has also stated that they "will
have a_ team in the quarter,-halfand
one mile relay championships. Occi-
dental has a very strong. squad of
sprinters and will be hard to beat inf
these events. Canada"willi also be
represented. 5 Thus with Canada,

' Cuba, England and colleges as far

west as California represented, half
of the globe’ will be int_erested _in the
results of ,Pennsyl_van_ia’s great " car-
nival. It is "probable "also that Aus-
tralia willsenda college team, these
men being on their way‘ to the Olym-
pic games in Paris next July. ”
The invitations to the "carnival have

more. than sixty -colleges have sent
word) that they will be on hand. It
looks as if last year's record, when
112 colleges competed at thecarnival,
will be broken, as many collegesare
still to‘ be heard from. j
The. invitations‘ to, the schools will
go out this week. Judging by early:
inquiries, -more schools than u.eve1‘..: Will
attend. Last‘ year, there were over
450 schoolsrepresented. It is-going

to be very diﬁicult to handle. the

games in the two days alloted to them.

The carnival will be of‘especial'im-
portance this year, because of ‘the
keen,“ competition __for the ._Olympic
team that will represent this country
in Paris _. -this,ye,ar.__' The relay car-
nival will give the college «athletes of
the entire country 'a_cl1ance-to show.
their ability and the -results -will no
doubt have a bearing on‘ the ultimate
decision of_ the Olympic committee in
choosing the American (team. _

Any -schools or colleges desiring to
attend the. carnival may do “so as all
are invited L by writing _to the Man-
ager of the.-Carnival, George W. '_Orten,

-Dr. W, D. -Grapern spoke "at the reg-
ular" meeting of the John Marshall
-Club. held last Frisday in the Ruskin
Apartments. .Hevspoke on the “Rela-
‘tion .Betw_een Law and Politics”. ' He
emphasized, the fact that there were
more lawyers in politics than men of
any other profession. _ ‘ V

vHe"said in part: ~ “About three-*
fourthsof the Senate, in fact all of
the higher legislative bodies, are law-
yers.‘, This is true to a l'a1"ger degree

 

farmer feels that the business of law
making’ is for the lawyer, not the
businessman. We ﬁnd tha.t~in the.
‘cities a large per cent" of “the.-oﬂices
are-ﬁlled by business men. The pro-
gressives seemingly objectto the law-.
yers in office because they say that-
he is always looking back, not 1 for-
ward. , He’ is .constantly readingold
cases-. and the yprogressives think, that
he should icleail with each case as an
entirely new one.” ‘ ‘ ’
