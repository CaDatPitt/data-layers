 Demonstration Block

 

 Gets Green Light

_ After a year of trying, haggling, and, ultimately, failing, Pitt’s
demonstration block will go through to operation for the Notre Dame

game.

Ben Grady, swimming coach and head of the block, an-

nounced Friday that plans are complete up to participation of ‘the

it  student body.

The new system, developed after the go-ahead signal was given

'iTby James Hagan, Athletic Director, and Student Congress, is designed

to produce “the best demonstratione ;

blo_ck in the nation.”
The bloc is located in the fore-

 stands of section 17 between the
9,30 and 40-yard lines. The com-

ﬁpieteji» bloc will be roped err at

the formation lines.

College Prexy
Cites Dangers
Of Enrollment

Palo Alto, Calif. — (IP) — Dr.
Donald B. Tresidder, president of
Stanford University, warned re-
cently that American colleges and
universities are facing grave
dangers.

The most serious danger, he de-
clared, is that in attempting to
provide for increasing numbers,
they may spread their resources
too thinly and lower the quality
of work to the point where gradu-
ates are inadequately prepared for
responsibilities they must assume.
i As an answer to the dangers
facing higher education, he urged
vigilance against the intrusion of
trivial activities into the univer-
sity‘s curriculum; keeping guard
against overspecialization; and
bringing of more unity and a clear-
er sense of purpose into the pro-
gram of general education.

Dr. Trasidder, in complimenting
the Stanford faculty for maintain-
ing a high standard of work de-
spite many difficulties and con-
siderable personal sacriﬁce, ‘not-
edthat one of the hazards facing
higher education today is the
shortage has forced most institu-
tions to increase the size of classes
and make other adjustments not
designed to improve the effective-

ness of instruction.

The "new plan, effective July 1,
eliminates the assessment of dues
from members. Instead, each Uni-
versity graduate automatically be-
comes a member of the Associa-
tion. -

Contributions under the new

plan fall into three categories;
general giving, allocated giving,
and designated giving. The choice
of plan is optional with, the giver.

The Giving Plan is on a yearly
basisp Alumni members in the
Pittsburgh district will be can-
vassed by direct—mail and personal
solicitation. No quotas will be set
except in special cases such as
class reunions. ' '

Pitt’s alumni will not be the
first to try the Giving Plan. In
1946, colleges and universities
throughoutthe country were aided
by Giving Plans which raised a
total of one billion dollars.

Acknowledgement of contribu-
tions will appear in the current
issue of the Alumni News Review.
At the end of each year a detailed
report containing the names of all
the donors will be published.

Heading the Alumni Giving
Plan Committee wh:ich will direct
the campaign is Marcus A. F. Fol-
lansbee. Aiding him is Roy Mc-
Kenna who was named honorary
chairman of the committee.

A, Cheer for Ike

Last Thursday evening, the freshman men
of the University ate to‘ their stomachs’ con-
tent at thesemi-annual frosh banquet.

The feast marked a milestone in the oﬂicial
activities of the University since pre-war days.
It was tops._ Ned McIntosh of the office of the
dean of men put theaffair over and deserves
credit.

But food wasn’t the only thing served at
that banquet. In a three hour long program--—-
ordinarily as monotonous as it is long—the
froshewere treated to a real spectacle. Aldo
“Ike” Icardi, past cheerleader, student govern-
ment, ODK, etc., put on a gymnastics show
that would match the “Flying Costellos. ” Ike ’s
task was to produce noise. He did that. It’s
enough to say that the frosh were‘ many deci-
bels above normal.

Ike brought the one thing Pitt rooters have
lacked’ for a good many seasons, too. Precision.
It was a treat to hear Pitt cheers coming with
a Vlfest Point punch from men not familiar
with the Pitt scheme.

But, then, Ike has a way with rooters. His
career as a Pitt cheerleader dates back to 1940.
Now in law school, the energetic Icardi spends
most of his spare time with the undergrads.

it it t

Icardi’s romping enthusiasm paid oﬁ
Thursday and, as Mike Milligan theorized,
“The kind of cheering we’ve had (at the frosh
banque:-t) should drown out all of the partisans
at the Notre Dame game.”

VVe’re looking for that to happen. It has
been a distasteful chore to sit through one
N D game after another and listen to Pitts-
burghers cheer for a school from Indiana,
Notre Dame has consistantly good—even great.
football elevens. That is no reason, however,
for ﬁfty thousand out of sixty thousand foot-
ball fans to cheer when Johnnie Lujak tosses
a touchdown passin Pitt stadium.

The job'of ‘ ‘ drowning out ” South Bend fans

I in Pitt stadium is diﬂicult. It will take a thor-

ough knowledge of Pitt cheers and close at-
tention to the leaders. It can be done.
I II III

The call is out this week for new cheer-
leaders. Ben Grady, returned swim coach,lhas
asked for all interested men to make them-
selves available for the ﬁrst practice tomorrow
afternoon. He hopes that at least one man
shows up who can compare with the great
Icardi. Pitt needs that kind of cheerleader
among the undergrads. And Grady wants that
kind for the Notre Dame game and every

.other game this season.

  [Beat the Band- Just Try

Pitt ’s 120-pieces Marching Band, 1947
model, made its debut Thursday evening at the
traditional banquet for freshman men.

Mr. Robert L. Arthur, band director since
1938, has performed another miracle by mould-
ing six score men into what can be called con-
servatively the ﬁnest college band in the na-
tion. Just how he manages to make each suc-
cessive band a. little better than the last is a
puzzle to us all, and, no doubt, to band direc-
tors at other universities throughout the coun-
try.

repertoire elicited several ovations from some
nine hundred guests assembled in Soldiers and
Sailors Memorial banquet room. Already en-
thusiastic freshmen left the banquet with in-
creased enthusiasm, the result of the stirring
strains emanatingfrom the band.

Football games, never complete without the
pomp and color of uniformed bands parading
through intricate formations, promise to be
unchallenged as the best entertainment of the
year for Pitt students and the sports fans of the
city.

It’s a foregone conclusion that no football
tickets will be unused for the ﬁrst home foot-
ball game with Notre'Dame, October 6. Every-
one wants to. see the nation ’s best college
football team but remember, you’ll also see

'Alumnus Writes Novel

About War's Futility

Peace or no peace the books about the war are still com-

ing

Latest author to try his hand at describing an epic of

blood and mud is John D. Burgan, a Pitt graduate and a former
Navy officer. “Two Per Cent Fear” is the title of Burgan’s

effort.

Burgan’s avowed purpose in Writing “Two Per Cent Fear”

was to depict the monotony and¢

futility_ of war. He endeavors to
do so by following thesfortunes of
a company of Navy stevedores
through a cycle that leads from
island boredom to invasion and
back to boredom again.

The idea is good, but the exe-
cution deﬁnitely falls short of
success. There are ﬂashes when

the author manages to capture that

hopeless, caught-in-a-web feeling
that possessed so many men who
were subjected to the rotting mo-
notony of island existence. But
Burgan seems unable to sustain
this realism for long.

He permits his story to become
burdened ﬁrst with windy ﬂash-
backs and later with in implausi-
ble episode in which a Navy of-

ﬁcer nobly sacriﬁces his chances
for home leave to save one of his
men. There follows an anti-cliamtic

denouement in which the ofﬁcer_

reaches home through a foul-up in
orders. It allseems just a bit too
pat to be true.

Burgan, however, shines in his 1

description of the invasion. Much
of it is probably gleaned fron'5ex-
perience. At least it carries the

authenticity that comes with ﬁrst-
hand observation. ‘

Aside from those chapters deal-
ing with the actual battle, “Two
Per Cent Fear” is strictly an ordi-
nary, run-of-the-mill job.

Appeal for Support

How much is a Diplodocus Carnegie worth to you? You
probably have seen the dinosaur. skeleton, a tremendous bony
structure standing in Carnegie museum beside its companion,
the Apattosaurus Louisae. To many people, these two prehistoric
monsters are the most interesting things in the building.

This year, for the ﬁrst time in the history of Carnegie insti-

tute, you have a chance to buy a part interest in the Diplodocus.
A v v '

Carnegie Institute, for 51 years‘

supported by an endowment that
has grown to 9% million dollars,

"has found that its interest rates

are declining, while operating costs
and expenditures are increasing
at a terrifying rate. To cut ex-
penses, the staff was decreased,
shorter hours were put into effect,
and expeditions and exhibits were
curtailed or cut out entirely. But
this has not been enough.

Although the library is publicly
supported, and the music hall is
nearly self-supporting because of
revenues from rental of the audi-
torium, the ﬁne arts and museum
departments are maintained en-
tirely on interest from the endow-
ment. Because expenditures have
increased from 50 to 100 per cent,
it was possible that these depart-
ments would be forced to operate
on a part-time basis. ~

Since at this time more people
than ever before are going to the
Institute, it was decided to form a

supporting society, made up of

Allegheny county residents.

To student members of the Fine
Arts and Museum Society, the an-
nual membership feeis $2. If you
join the society, there will be a
new bond of affection between you

and the Diplodocus, but that’s not-

all. There are other privileges ex-
tended to members.

You will receive the Institute’s
publications, including the Car-
negie Magazine, monthly calendars
of events, and museum guide
books. You will be invited to “be-
hind, the scenes” lectures, ﬁeld
trips, nature walks, and short ex-
peditions. Specialized groups and
hobby clubs are being organized
and you will attend previews of
special exhibits and motion pic-
tures, Every year, the Insittute

state the work of each department

whatever his interests
may be, in every phase of his life
at Pitt,” Walt Thompson, Owl edi-
tor, announced.

“In fulﬁlling this plan, the 1948
Owl will contain an innovation in
its feature section, a greatly ex-
panded candid ddverage of the stu-
dent at work and play around the
campus. As many students as pos-
sible will be represented, not
merely the students prominent in
activities,” he stated.

According to Thompson, the

editors will attempt to capture in
photography the varied personali-
ties which each contribute to
campus life and the composite stu-
dent character. ‘

“The staff will devote all of its
efforts toward ﬁnding the student
as he is and portraying his Pitt
life in its natural, informal real-
ity,” Thompson explained.

Another revision in the ’48 Owl

will be the elimination 6f the
drapes and tuxedoes that have
stereotyped the senior portrait sec-
tion . in the past. The change is
intended to provide more natural
and personal effects.
‘ Gimbe1’s Photo-Reﬂex _ studio
will take formal and informal
shots of every student who orders
an Owl. All women ‘have been
asked to wear white, blouses and
men students to dress in dark
coats, white shirts, and dark ties
for their portrait appointments.

The price of the ’48 yearbook
has been set at $5.00 for both
seniors and underclassmen. In-
creased co sts of publication
have necessitated the $1.50, in-
crease in the price of Owls sold to
underclassmen. Senior prices re-

The Best Things
ln Life Are Free

Three freshman shuffled nerv-
ously up to the counter in the
News ofﬁce. 7

“Can I help you?” inquired a
News reporter.

Grinning Auncertainly, the short-
est frosh asked, “How do you get
one of these?” He pointedoto the
stack of papers piled on the coun-
ter. “Yeah,” said the second frosh,
“how much are they.” He reach-
ed in his P<)cket for change.

“They’re free,” replied, the re-
porter. “Take one.”

‘ “Gee, free!” they chorused.
“Thanks.”
The three freshman left the

News office enthusiastically dis-
cussing the “free” News.

Might ‘as well face it. Pitt is

To Michigan Wilh Team

Pitt’s Marching Band will accompany the Panther football team
to Ann Arbor, .Mich. for the Pitt-Michigan game on Oct. 11.

Through the ﬁnancial aid of E. V. Babcock, former mayor of the
City of Pittsburgh, the band .possesses a complete set of matching
gold-ﬁnish instruments, one of the few such sets in the world.

Formations for the Michigan game and for the ﬁrst home game
against Notre Dame were worked out and rehearsed at the band’s pre-

semester camp at Zelienople dur-¢

ing the ﬁrst week of Se tember.

Robert L. Arthur, band director,
had aerial photographs taken from
several angles for every tentative
formation to aid in eliminating
ﬂaws caused by foreshortening of
perspective ‘of fans high in the
stadium. _

Varsity band consists of 150
men, including players, directors,
librarians, managerial staff, oiﬁ-
cial staff ancl alternates.

A freshman marching band has
been. organized for this semester.
It will contain about 60 members
with a potential membership of
100, Mr. Arthur has issued a call
for all interested freshmen to at-
tend rehearsals.

Addition of the freshman band
brings to four the total of Univer-
sity bands, including the varsity
marching band, the concert band

VA Credit R.aise.Causes
Stampede at Registration

A last minute announcement from Veterans.Administration rais-
ing the 12-credit minimum for subsistence caused a mild stampede as
3000 veterans attempted to add two credits to their fall schedules.

Vets must now schedule 14 credits to retain ﬂill subsistence status.

However, since University officials were not prepared to handle
the increase, many veterans were unable to schedule a suitable two- '
credit course. ‘These veterans will be classiﬁed as part-time students. ‘

According to J. Edward Ricart,¢_

director of Veterans’ Affairs at
Pitt, part-time students are classi-
fied into the following groups:

(1) 11-13 credits equal % sub-
sistence.

(2) 7-10 credits equals 1,5 sub-
sistence.

(3) 4-7 credits equals 1/4 sub-
sistence.

Students carrying four credits
or less are eligible to receive only

ROTC Musl-er
Tops All Marks

Pitt ROTC has set a new all

time high for college ROTC units
by enrolling 650 students for the
Fall semester. Some 473 freshmen
who have had less than one year’s
service or no previously military
training, will take the elementary
course.

Eligibility is determined by
physical examination through the
medical ROTC at the University
under the command of Lt. Col.
Ozment of the Medical Corps.

In the advanced course 177 vet-
erans are enrolled. The Air Corps
topped the list of advanced en-
rollment with V§7 volunteers. Ar-
tillery ran close with 63, and the
quartermasters followed with 27.
The Engineers fell in last place
with 19.

Advanced students must pass
the regular officers type physical
examination conducted at the reg-
ular induction center in Pittsburgh
to enter the advanced units of the
Air, Artillery, Quartermaster or
Engineering Corps. The ﬁrst three
are new units at Pitt. Only the
advanced course will deal with
the tactics and techniques of the
separate branches.

Only those in the advanced
course will receive the 79c daily
allotment. Students in the ele-
mentary course will not receive
an allotment.

Some vets were unable to regis-
ter for the advanced course be-
cause of schedule conflicts.

121 basic students will receive
their ROTC training at Ellsworth

tuition and supplies, at the rate '
of 341 of their tuition allotments.-

They are not eligible for any. sub
sistence. _ -
These changes apply exclusive-
ly to undergraduat student vet-
erans. The 12-credit. minimum
still holds for graduate _students.

Munchauseln T acfics Fail To linpress Doorkeeper

By Myron Kopelman
Baron Munchausen, the world’s biggest liar, had nothing on Pitt

tudents.

During the war, it took imagination and ﬁnesse to capture a pair
of nylons or a golden nugget of butter in a long line that ended in
a short supply. Last week during registration, students were trying to
get around another line at the end of which were much sought—after

and fast-disappearing class cards.

Dozens of shrewd schemes were¢

employed by students attempting
to gain admittance to the Mosque
prior to their appointments.

One girl approached a. door
guard with a bandaged leg, claim-
ing she could not stand in the long
line. What with the new skirt
lengths, the sentinel could not
make a closer inspection. _

Glib tongues rolled off many

other excuses. “I left my hat in
there,” “I’m looking for my wife,”
“Which way to the lavatory?” and
“I work in there” were just a few.
Quite naturally, many students
tried the back door. But it was
ably defended by Frank S. Fiscel,
a modern day Horatio who turns
them back as fast as they come.
According to Fiscel, they wanted

to see Dean Crawford, forgot to
ﬁll out a certain card, claimed the
front doors were locked, or com‘-
plimented him on his necktie.

Mr. Fiscel, a mild—mannered,
diplomatic gentleman, was partic-
ularly vexed by one student. A
reporter from the News, who,
afterinterviewing him and taking
his name for publication, requested
admittance.

Fiscel just stood there looking
hurt.

Talent Scouts

Comb District
For Gridders

By Myron Kopelman

Once again southerri schools
gleaned the cream of the‘ western
Pennsylvania high school football
crop. Thirty-ﬁve district school-
boys stars were surveyed by the
News to determine which college
they will attend. Sixteen went

South.

Western Pennsylvania gridirons
are combed yearly by a horde of
talent scouts. High school coaches
are compensated for persuading
their proteges to go South, and
head coaches of southern schools
come North to add their two cents.

Wally Butts, Georgia mentor,
became a regular ﬁxture at the
home of Ray Prosperi, Altoona
High School sensation. He event-
ually attained his objective.

Scouts Harass Stars

iBeattie Feathers, head man at
North Carolina State, personally
escorted “Little” John Huzvar,
230-pound fullback, from his Her-
shey home to the State campus. “I
can’t go home without running
over college coaches waiting on
my front to sign me up,” Huzvar
complained. He is expected to out-
do Bronko Nagurski.

It is difficult to resistthe lure
of Dixie. Scouts came in droves
to camp on the front porch of a
much-wanted high school star. A
southern agent slipped in the back
door and plunked a 1000 dollar
bill on the kitchen table. The boy
went South.

Many high school coaches ad-
vise their players not to accept
lucrative southern offers. ‘It is
charged that scholarships are re-
voked after a serious injury or if
the player fails to measure up. In
addition, football, in Dixie, is a
year-round proposition.

. Three Enter Pitt ,

Three of the thirty-ﬁve players
surveyed will ,attend Pitt. These
include: Bob Mihm, Westinghouse
gua-rd; Laurice Pierce, Jeannette

"Through Rose-tinted Glasses

Pitt students are optimistic about the coming football season

, despite the suicidal schedule on hand. An opinion poll conducted by
* the News found 35 per cent looking forward to a “good” season.

J Panther rooters are withholding opinions on Mike Milligan, new
headcoach, until they see the team in action. This attitude was
summed up sternly by Burton Butker, Col. '48, who -said:

“I think of Milligan the same as I think of Herman (Billy Her-

’_’I‘he ivalidityof the poll was les-

\ sened somewhat by the variation

of terms in which students pic-
tured a good or bad season.

Asked which games she
thought the Panthers would win,
she replied, “Oh, I suppose Michi-
gan, Purdue, Penn State, Indiana,

Following are other interesting
comments:

Herb Douglas, Ed., ’48: “Pitt

“has as goodaﬁrst team as any on

their schedule except N otre Dame.
Although the team seems weak in
reserves, the first team is very
good. Mike Milligan, as a line
coach, is thebest.”

Edward Blanchard, Bus. Ad., ’48:
“If they win three, they’re lucky.”

Sally Sniderman, Col., ’51: “I

good coach.”

Joseph R. Most. Eng., ’49: “I
guess they’ll beat Penn Statepand

Mike Milligan a chance.

Harry Wilson, Bus. A., ’49: “The
team is ‘much improved, and it may
win four or ﬁve games.”

  

Lila Lee Terry, Ed., ’48: “Pitt
will beat Illinois, Indiana, Purdue,

others.”

Joan Reichman, Col., ’51: “Pros-

Mike’s a good boy.”

David Neuman, Bus. Ad., '48:

Bemis Proposes
S.'|'uden1's D_rec'|'
IM Council Plan

The goal of the University In-
tramural program is, “To have as
many unaffiliated students partic-
ipating as possible”. So stated Leo
Bemis, director of the program.

Although plans are still in the
formative state, a council of stu-
dents for directing the program is
proposed. Council representatives
will be made up of students from
the various teams, University
publications, and departments and
schools of the University.

A Meeting Set for ‘Friday

A meeting of managers of the
participating teams is slated for
Monday, September 29. Managers
of last year’s teams will be noti-
ﬁed of the meeting and new man-
agers are urged to attend the con-
fab.

The conference will attempt to
iron out any wrinkles in the set-
up. For this reason, Bemis urges
every team that expects to par-
ticipate in the Intramural program
to have a representative there.

Play at Three Fields

Present plans call for football
to be played at the three ﬁelds

above Trees Gym. The ﬁelds at

Ellsworth Center and at the
Schenley Oval are available if the
demand for playing space is great.

Bowling and touch football
leagues are the only activities
now deﬁnitely scheduled. Bemis
added that other sports will be
scheduled when evidence of de-
mand is brought to the attention
of the Intramural Council.

Panthers Make
Bid for iinois Win

~ 1 By Max Scherb

Four times an angry Panther has stalked the Illini Brave.
Four times he has been whipped and sent home. Saturday, a
persistent Panther makes his ﬁfth bid for the initial Win.

’l‘h1s_t1me _Pittsburgh has the unproven advantage of Head
Coach Mike Milhgan. They also have the best Pitt team in nine
years. With this is the not too comforting satisfaction of know-
mg they can ’t do worse than their predecessors.

The ﬁrst meeting occurred in 1943 during a condition known
as war. To the accompaniment of headlines proclaiming the
Nazis falling back on Rome, Illinois won, 32-25.

The problems faced by the coaches that year were not con- ,
ﬁned to the gridiron. Just before game time, police officials came V’

to Coach Shaughnessy with a‘warrant for one of his starting

linemen.

A souvenir-hunting boy became
attached to a clock in his Chicago
hotel and took it with him. The
missing clock was easily recovered,
but only through persuasive talk,-
ing was he released long enough
to play. Evidently his ability
didn’t compensate for the trouble
because he was later dropped
from the squad.

Young Makes Debut

Next year, the football bookies
welcomed the Illini to town with
a 34 point edge in their favor.
Through means known only to
God and the syndicates, the ﬁnal
score was 39--5. '

erners was becoming rather tiring
for the Pitts, but they were un-

game was a slow ground affair
with both sides playing a sloppy
brand of ball.

points while netting only an insuf-
ﬁcient six. I

No one knows what Mike Mil-
ligan will tell the squad before
the game Saturday, but he might
borrow a page from Illinois his-
tory. Bob Zupke was coaching a
weak Illinois team against an op-
ponent they hadn’t beaten for
years. ‘

Just before the game, Zupke
walked into the dressing room and
said to his amazed squad, ‘‘I am
Louie XIV, after me the deluge.”

Illinois won.
