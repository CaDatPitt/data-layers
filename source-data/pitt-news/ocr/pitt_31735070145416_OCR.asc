Leena’s owner an Oakland icon

.4’?

After moving to the US. frorniPalestine, restaurateur brings Arab food and culture to Oakland

‘ Kelsey Shea
Contributing Editor

When Mohammed Issa’s mother de-
parted Pittsburgh for Palestine after
visiting her son, among her clothes,
passport and essentials she left with
a large jar of hot peppers.

“From here allthe way to Palestine.
That is how much she likes my hot
peppers,” Issa recalled while grinning
from one side of his crinkled face to
the other. ~

Issa sat down to tell this story in
his small restaurant on Oakland Av-

enue — Leena’s Food. The inside ofhis
modest establishment is a testament
to Issa’s changing life over the past
30 years. The hanging houseplants
and Persian music are typical of most

Middle—Eastern restaurants, but the
pictures hanging on the tan walls _

tell a lot about Issa. The inside of the
restaurant reveals the unique mix of
Issa’s Palestinian ties at home and his
integration into American culture.
Leena’s, namedafter one of Issa’s
six daughters, is what you would ex—
pect a small dive on a college campus
to look like. It isn’t the type of place

you go for the atmosphere. Its tables '

are wobbly and the walls are deco-
rated with his niece’s and daughters’
art projects. It’s the award—winning

fresh falafel, authentic spinach pies_
and hot greasy gyros —— as well as '

conversation with Issa —that draw
people into Leena’s.

Customers pass in and out of the
restaurant laughing and talking with
Issa-. Standingbehind the small coun-
ter, Issa wears abaggy sweater on his
rail—thin frame and a thick mustache
across his ever—grinningface. He sends
off a regular customer with an “I love

you baby!” and checks on unrecog-
nized patrons, walking up to their
table to ask, “How you like that?”

l One man asks Issa if the gyro he
ordered was “the real deal.” ‘

Issa stopped the interview.

“This is my recipe. This is my
homemade recipe, my wife’s recipe!”
he said proudly.

The man ﬁnished his meal, shook
Issa’s hand and assured him he’ll be
back before walking out the door.

Through daily interactions like
this, Issa has become a sort of local

celebrity on Pitt’s campus. Whether it’s

the dirty j okes he’s telling or the inter-
rogations about why you don’t want
tomatoes on your gyro (“They are
maybe the best part!”), most people
walk out of Leena’s with some sort of
friendly or funny interaction.

‘Tm a very friendly person,” Issa
said. “It makes the days go fast.”

Issa came to Pittsburgh from Pal-
estine in 1979.

He came as a part of a surge of im-
migrants who moved to the United
States between the mid—196os and
early 1980s, after changes were made
to the U.S. Immigration and National-
ity Act in 1965, according to a Migra-
tion Policy Institute report.

Issa said that education and em-
ployment weren’t easily found in the
West Bank —— where his family lives
in Palestine.

He says he was “very bored — no
money, no jobs, no wor .”

After attending Point Park Uni-
versity, Issa transferred to the Com-
munity College of Allegheny County
and then again to Pitt and eventually
ended up working for his brother’s
plastering company before getting
into the food business. He said the
transition was a natural one.

“I just added this and this and
this, and it’s good. Now here I am,”
he said.

Leena’s started as a cart that sat
outside of the Hilhnan Library from
1998 until 2004, when the carts were
forced to move with the opening of
Schenley Plaza. Issa made the best of
the situation and used it as an oppor-
tunity to open a more permanent es-
tablishment. Even now, Issastill makes
sacriﬁces to make ends meet.

Because of his ﬁnancial troubles,
he recently extended his weekend

hours to 3:30 a.m. to serve the late-
night college crowd. On nights Leena’s
stays open late, he sleeps on the ﬂoor
in a small room above the restaurant
rather than driving all the way back
to his home in Murrysville twice in
a four—hour period —— the restaurant
opens at 10 a.m.

Despite the sacriﬁces, it’s still all

a part of what he believes to be the V

American dream.

“Since I was akid, I always wanted
to come to America, and Iﬁnally did
it,” he said. “Coming here, it’s like
walking in ‘a dark room with a ﬂash-
light. You only see two or three steps
infront of you, but the longer I’m here,
the more lightl see.”

After 30 years working in the
United States, the country’s appeal
has not faded for Issa.

“Americahas amagnetinthe cen-
ter of it and it draws people in,” he said.
“It’s such a good country. The people
in America are wonderful, with some
exceptions, of course. Very friendly
people.”

Issa believes that the friendliness
he sees in other people is areﬂection of
his own outgoing nature, which saves
him from the harsh prejudices some
Americans harbor against Middle-
Eastern immigrants. Issa said he’s
never had a problem.

“I’m a nice person that peoplewill
feel horrible for calling names. Plus I
make their food. They trust me that
far,” he said.

from hanging Qur’an scrolls, is an or-
namental plate with Hebrew letters

ongoing Israeli and Palestinian con-
ﬂict in the Middle East —— even with
family living in the West Bank.

“I’m a little different than people
who live over there. I’ve been here for
30 years, andl always wanted peace,”
he said. “To me it doesn’t matter be-
tween nationalities — if you are a nice
person, you are a nice person. If you
are nota nice person, you are hard.”

Issa admitted that he is not the
perfect Muslim, but he prays and be-
lieves in God. He sees religion more

abstractly.

“Religion is about being good to
people. It’s how you treat them, you
respect them, you listen to them, you
never hurt them, you ﬁnd compro-

that Issa has really clung onto is the .

Sustainability, youth topics of panel

Pitt environmental organizations host local activists, experts on campus

Mollie Durkin
Staﬁ‘ Writer

Students and youngpeople interested in environ-
mental activism should write to publications and
expand their news sources, a local congressman
said last night at a panel event on campus.

Sustainability, technology and involvement

were main topics of discussion last night at the
Frick Fir1eArts Auditorium, when the Pittsburgh
Student Environmental Coalition, an effort be-
tween Free the Planet, the Blue Green Alliance at
Pitt and the Sierra Student Coalition, presented
“Rustbelt Renewal: A Town Hall Forum on the
Promise of a Clean Energy Economy’ to about
50 attendees last night.

The event, which dealt with global warming
and energy resources, featured four panelists:
Congressman Mike Doyle (D—PA), 14th District
of Pa.; Patrick McMahon, Amalgamated Transit
Union Local 85; Constantine Samarasof Carnegie
Mel1onUniversity; and Bob Wallace ofPenn State
University. ,

Each panelist presented a brief introductory
speech before two student speakers  ques-
tions thatwere submittedby students online. The
diverse panelists made their roles and differences
apparentintheir speeches. Doyle discussed how
he worked to put together the American Clean
Energy and Security Act, and how it has still not '
passed  the Senate.

Samaras, a RAND Corporation energy and
climate analyst and adjunct professor of energy
innovation at CMU, focused on the scientiﬁc
aspect ‘of energy and sustainability. McMahon
represented transit labor, and he dismissed the
beneﬁts of mass transit —— particularly, hybrid
buses and electricrailsystems. ,

-Wallace, the executive director ofPerm State’s
BioEnergy Bridge, concentrated on new, cleaner
resources and forms of energy. The BioEnergy

. Bridge is an organization aimed to‘ promote sus-
tainable power,ﬁ1els and products through assis-
tanceforindustry and enuepreneurialbusinesses,
according to the groups website.

howstudents and young people can take action.

man Doyle said. “Fm here because you’re‘here.”

He encouraged a ‘.‘grassroots swelling of sup-
port.” He said those who want to get involved
should write letters to editors of publications
and expand the sources from which they receive
their news. '

Seth Bush, a sophomore computer engineer-
ing major at Pitt and member of the Pittsburgh
Student Environmental Coalition, helped orga-
nize the event. He said he was pleased with the
presentation.

‘7Iwas really impressedwithallthe speakers,”
he said. “It’s really irnportantto stir up some pas-
sion.”

McMahon felt satisﬁed as well.

“It’s good to see youth geuing out, getting in-
volved and getting educated,” he said.

Doyle said the turnout was impressive, con-
sidering the poor weather.

“I try to always say yes’ to these kinds of
things,” he said. “It’s important to see what the
youth has to say.”

Editorial

Snow shoveling

ordinance needs

enforcement

ast week’s record snow
storm provided an enjoy-

able snow day streak, but

by now we’re all getting tired of '
winter. Snow—laden Pittsburgh‘

might be aesthetically pleasing,
but the laborious trudge through
snowy sidewalks will make any-

, one gripe, and is avery real safety

hazard.

Those brave enough waddled
through shoe—print snow trails
formed by those even braver,
yet some sidewalks were all but
impassable for the pedestrian.
But if everyone did his job, we
might not have been in such a
snow-bound state.

According to city ordi-
nance, the city’s Public Works
Department can issue citations
to residents who fail to shovel
sidewalks in the front of their
property within 24 hours after
the ‘snowfall (see related story,
page 1). After receiving a warn-
ing, violators can be issued a $25
fine. But here’s the thing: they
aren’t.

V “We’re not enforcing the law

now,” Rob Kaczorowski, city

Public Works director, said.
Turns out the department isn’t
enforcing .the law because of the
unusually significant amount of
snow.

This mindset is a bit illogi-

cal. If you don’t enforce sidewalk‘

shoveling when there’s enough
snow on the ground for it to be
necessary for the city to function,
when do you enforce it? ‘
Oaklandhad its share of un-
kept sidewalks.‘ Of course, many
of the residents are college—aged.
But even if students are a little
bit more limber and less likely to
suffer a crippling sidewalk-slip,
the conditions were dangerous
_to all. Since the roads were them-
selves hardly snow-free, some

, city’s salt 

students inevitably opted for the
sidewalk rather than trying to
drive or catch a bus.

Many other Oakland residents
are not college-aged, and this
problem certainly isn’t limited
to one neighborhood.

Also, with sidewalks that are
increasingly difficult to trudge,
pedestrians are inclined to walk
in the narrow part of the street
cleared by tire tracks or snow
plows. Given already slippery
conditions for drivers, this is
even more unsafe for both them
and the displaced pedestrians.

Kaczorowski said the city
rarely hands out the citations and
expects property owners to up-
hold their property. As has been
demonstrated, that outlook’s be-
come too idealistic.

From a pension crisis to a lack
of funds for snow removal itself,
the city sure could use some extra
money. The $25 for a violation
isn’t going to buy Pittsburgh a
private salt quarry, but it could
create an extrasource of revenue
that could help relieve Pitts-
burgh’s emergency expenses.

Those physically unable to
shovel snow still need to take
responsibility for their side-
walks by making arrangements
to have them shoveled by others,
whether it be a friend or a hired
shovel. '

By not enforcing this law,
the Public Works Department
is prompting people to be lazy
at the cost of others.“Elnforce-
ment means a degree of manual
labor for those not equipped with
a snow blower, but if it meant
avoiding a ﬁne, you can be sure
that with more snow onlthe side-
walks, therewould be more snow
shovels, less perturbed pedestri-
ans and a few more dollars in the

Exclaiming names in vain

Don’t “Jesus—Christ-! ” over spilled milk.

  
 
 

Steve Kaszycki
For The Pitt News

As a Christian, I’m regularly per-
plexed when people use Jesus
Christ’s name as a fill-in excla-
mation. “I did horrible on that
test,” “I broke my ankle” and “the
food from that restaurant was
horrible” can all be adorned with
a non-too-reverent utterance of
Jesus’ name. But why?

Perhaps it’s a sign of a cul-

tural drift away from faith, but ~

I don’t think so. I find that some
religious people have no problem
taking the Lord’s name in vain.
In fact, I’ve known some Catho-
lics who bring some of the saints
along for the ride —— “Jesus, Mary
and Joseph!” Of course, if you’re
hoping to be. more respectful,

you could always add in the “al- .

mighty” ending to the phrase.
“Christ almighty” and “Good

God almighty” are two such ut-
terances I’ve heard.

I don’t think that really makes
it more defensible, though. If
you’re a Christian, then you be-
lieve God is the Almighty, but re-
acting to having slipped on some
ice might not be the best time to
testify to this, particularly if it’s
adjoined with words that turn
into bleeps on most television
shows. V .
Truthfully, I ﬁnd Christian-
related utterances to be accre-
tions to the collection of gener-
ally objectionable references. It
just doesn’t make sense. ‘

Steven Pinker, a linguistics
professor at Harvard, traces re-
ligious-themed exclamations —
and indeed, swearing, writ large

’ — to religion, particularly to the

more totalizing role of religion in
yesteryear, whenlsupernatural
explanations for virtually every-
thing abounded. Thus the term

cursing.

Hence another popular one:
pairing “God” with “damn,” sel-
dom used in the actual most lit-
eral definition of commanding
God to damn the direct object
— sometimes only implied —— of
the sentence. That realization is
relieving considering that often
the object in question is not one
that we would actually want God
to damn —— our sibling, our text-
book or our vehicle. If God took
those commands seriously, hell
would be littered with annoying
family members and inanimate
objects that had really done noth-
ing to warrant spending eternity
in the hot place —-I and I don’t
mean an Arizona junkyard.

I’m not so sure that demand-
ing God’s action is always ob-
jectionable. Proclaiming “God
save me!” while in a precarious
situation -— preferably one that
involves possible mortal danger

ART EXHIBITION

  Arts 89’ Entertainment

Satire not just for Colbert and Stewart

Andy Tybout
Stajf Writer

“Caricature, Satire, and
Comedy of Manners: Works
on Paper from the 18th
through 20th Centuries” '
Feb. 13-Aug. 15 ‘
Carnegie Museum of Art
Works on Paper Gallery

Before YouTube and “Saturday
Night Live,” people had to rely on
paint and pencil to vent their frus-
tration with societal absurdity.

“Satire and caricature are
really old concepts,” Amanda
Zehnder, assistant curator of ﬁne
arts at the Carnegie Museum of
Art and organizer of the exhibit,
said. “Each artist has such a dif-
ferent way of playing with this
idea of distortion.”

Everyone will be able to ob-
serve how much comedy and
satire has changed, and how
much it’s remained the same in,
“Caricature, Satire, and Comedy

of Manners.”

The exhibit contains about 80
prints from 12 artists, with a focus

on three main artists: Francisco
Goya, Honoré Daumier and Wil-

liam Hogarth. It spans a range of

culture, topics and tone.

“They are deﬁnitely huge ﬁg-
ures in the tradition in terms of
print making,” she said. “Those
three artists are so different.” _

Undoubtedly the darkest of
the three, Goya exhibits work
that epitomizes the-grim aspect
of the genre.

A Spanish printmaker of bleak
visions and monsters, Goya has
work on display that’s far from
humorous, and it proves difficult,
at ﬁrst, to discern the criticism
beneath the imagery.

Goya’s critiques never grew
too speciﬁc for fear of political
repercussions.

“A lot of his prints involve im-
agery that he kind of took from
Carnival, and from folklore, and
superstition and so forth, and
blended it together with his own
sort of fantastical ideas,” she said.
“It’s so grand and nightmarish.”

Despite Goya’s inaccessibility,
Zehnder believes the ﬁrst edition
prints of the Goya book “Los Ca-

prichos” will attract the most at-

tention. A series of 80 prints, the
book’s pages will be turned every
couple months to allow repeat
visitors a wider impression of
Goya’s work.

“That is deﬁnitely, I think,
the star object of the show,” she
said.

For . those
who’d prefer a
mo re lightheart-
ed approach to
satire, there’s
the French
caricaturist ,
Daumier,’ an art- j
ist who focused _ 
his early attacks
on politics -
particularly his
“arch-nemesis,”
Louis-Philippe,
the kin g. of
France.

“H e was
very political in V
his interests,” _ I
Zehnder said. ’
“Very radical
for his time pe-
riod.”

After a par-

ticularly harsh 1832 caricature
of the French king, Daumier-was
sentenced to an extended jail sen-
tence. The sentence was eventual-
ly reduced, but Daumier remained
limited in his targets. New cen-
sorship laws forced the artist

to reform himself into a breezy
social caricaturist that Zehnder
called a “French Seinfeld.”

One notable piece of comedy
is Daumier’s “Parisian Types,”
which examines. the various
quirky characters seen in Paris.

SUMMER PREVIEW

Worthy summer festivals, in ﬂesh or fantasy

Whether or not you can make it, these music festivals are worth checking out

Kelsey Shea
Asst. At;-E Editor

As seemingly endlessmounds of
snow continue to impose them-
selves on Pittsburgh, it’s getting

MOVIE REVIEW

Lightning Thief’

lackluster movie

Myth0l0gy—based ﬁlm passable entertainment for family

Larissa Gula
Staff Writer

“Percyjackson and the Olympians: The
Lightning Thief” V
Starring: Logan Lerman, Brandon T.
Jackson, Alexandra Daddario
Directed By: Chris Columbus

Fox 2000 Pictures '

Grade: B-

Greek mythology is working its way
back into 21st century pop culture, and the
Greek gods are alive and well right here
in the U.S. — at least in one new movie.
They’re even having children.

“Percyjackson and the Olympians: The
Lightning Thief” tells the tale of Percy
Jackson, the son of the Greek god Posei-
don.

The ﬁlm is based on the first book in a
young adult series written by Rick Rior-

dan. A11 ﬁve books are set in the U.S. and ‘

intertwine Greek mythology with daily
life. .

Main character Percy Jackson, a teen-
ager who has dyslexia and ADHD, lives in
New York ——- at least until he’s‘ attacked,
and his mother and best friend usher him
out of the city and take him to Camp Half-
Blood. '

In a hurried pacing of plot, Percy’s
mother is kidnapped, and his best friend

"Grover reveals himself as Percy’s protec-

tor. Oh, and Grover is a satyr (half goat
and half man). '

It’s disclosed that Percy is Poseidon’s
son, and that Zeus currently believes Percy
stole his mythical lightning bolts. If Percy
does'not return the bolts, a war will break
out between the gods that will destroy
the Earth.

The logic of why Zeus thinks Percy took
his lightning bolts is never explained. In-
stead the ﬁlm focuses on a side quest to
save Percy’s mother.

Put simply, the ﬁlm is very fast. It never
lingers on a single scene or moment for
very long, but rather charges through with
action while barely touching on the real
mystery: Who actually stole the lightning
bolts‘?

Unfortunately, for those expecting
some iota of mystery, the culprit becomes
obvious after about half an hour.

. The fast pace covers up frequent mo-
ments of wooden acting from the cast,
who do a decent enough job to get ajbarely
passing stamp of approval.

And be warned, mythology fans: Some
parts of Greek mythology will be altered
to suit the ﬁlm’s purpose. (Being half-
god doesn’t make you a demigod, writ-
ers. Duh!) ‘

Yet the ﬁlm makes up for’ any ﬂaws
with at least one thing -— good humor.
The writers keep everything clean and
family—friendly. They even make the reces-
sion funny, at least for a few seconds. The
character of Grover, played by Brandon T.
Jackson, hasathe most energy of anyone
on screen. His every line will keep anyone
from taking this movie too seriously and
will remind him or her it’s.time to sit back
and laugh. » ‘

Put simply, “Lightning Thief” is not
the most emotional, most philosophical
or most beautiful ﬁlm of the year, and
it’s probably not the best interpretation
of a book to be rolled onto screen. But

it’s worth seeing just for good, innocent E

giggles with friends or family. And maybe,
even when the cast really isn’t acting their
best, it’s worth being laughed at.

Political art at Carnegie

Exhibit features political drawings by Goya, Daumier and Hogarth

Satire ( 7

“If you think about [“Sein—
feld”] as looking at social types
like the ‘close talker’ or ‘man

hands’  that is really predomi-

nate in a bunch of the prints from
Daumier,” she said. “It really is all
about just observing people —
regular, bourgeoisie people.”

In between Goya’s bleak

landscapes and Daumier’s post— .

political whimsy lies William
Hogarth, the English painter and

printmaker. . . -

The exhibit will feature nine I

engravings of his: two-prints from
his series “Marriage a-la-Mode,”
one stand-alone print and a full
series of six prints, “A Har1ot’s
Progress.” T

Most famously, "‘A Harlot’s
Progress” takes viewers through
the story of a naive young woman
who arrives in London wanting to
be a seamstress. The woman even-
tually winds up in dire straights,
becomes a prostitute and dies.

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Men’s Big East underdogs prove otherwise

Ben Duignan
Staff Writer

In the preseason Big East basketball
coaches’ poll released in October,
Pitt was picked to ﬁnish ninth out
of 16 teams.

The Marquette Golden Eagles
were voted to place 12th.

In February, both teams are

’_greatly exceeding expectations.
The Panthers are tiedfor third in
the Big East while the Golden Eagles
are tied for ﬁfth in the conference
standings.

Today the Panthers (19-6, 8-4
Big East) travel to the Bradley Cen-
ter, where Pitt is 0-3 since Mar-
quette joined the Big East, to face
the Golden Eagles (16-8, 7-5).

Marquette, like Pitt, was ex-
pected to ﬁnish lower this season
because of departing key players

7 from a year ago. ,

In 2008-09, the superstar trio
of Jerel McNeal, Wesley Matthews
and Dominic James accounted for
63 percent of the team’s scoring and
led the Golden Eagles to the second
round of the NCAA tournament.
McNeal and Matthews were named

to the all-Big East ﬁrst and second
teams, respectively.

The new-look Panthers of 2009-
10 had to deal with losing all-Big
East ﬁrst team performers Sam
Young and Dejuan Blair, and all-
Big East third team player LeVance
Fields. The trio combined almost 46
points per contest a year ago, giving

, ._ Expected to ﬁnish ninth, Pitt exceeds initial ranking and ties for third

in the two teams competing on
Thursday.
“To be where we arenow, it

shows that we’re bothwilling to

ﬁght after losing key components

of our teams,” Woodall said. “I ,

think we both have guys with simi-
lar attitudes and guys with a lot of
heart.” ‘ ' '

Both teams have more than
compensated for losses in scoring.

battling for an appearance in the
NCAA tournament.

dismissal of defensive back Elijah
Fields from the program for disci-
plinary reasons.

During his three active seasons
at Pitt, Fields — a ﬁfth-year senior

three interceptions last season.

Fields, who had a history of dis-

Pitt takes on fellow underestimated team, the Golden Eagles, at the Bradley Center

Basketball 4 10

Virginia.

Pitt coachjamie Dixon said Mar-
quette has the talent to compete
with any team in the Big East.

“Marquette is a very goodteam.
They shoot the ball very well,” Dixon
said. “They have a lot of experience
on that team and they are playing
very well.” .. l

' Dixon acknowledges that a
guard—.oriented team with expe-
irience across the roster-_ will be a

‘challenging opponent . A
“They get a lot of production out. . g
of their guards,” Dixon said. “These ,

guards might not be as physicalas

the ones in the past, butthey‘~can 

shoot it better. Everyone on their
roster has played a lot of minutes.
They’re very experienced.”

Pitt sophomore forward Nasir
Robinson also thinks the Golden
Eagles display a dynamic offensive

threat.

“They have a lot of people that
can penetrate the ball and kick it
out,” said Robinson. “Their guards
really spread out the offense.”

The Panthers should expect
a close contest from a team that
hasn’t lost a game by more than
nine points all season.

That fact shouldn’t faze a young

j Pitt team, however, which came off
7 a triple— overtime triumph over rival

West Virginia on Friday. The Pan-
thers are now 3-0 this season when
tied after regulation.

Robinson believes that this

on the Wildcats and helped them close the
gap to 67-65 with 1:52 to go — the closest
Villanova ever came to leading. /
On the verge of a late collapse, Pitt coach
Agnus Berenato called a timeout to calm her
team._]ania Sims then knocked down her only
ﬁeld, goal of the game to put the Wildcats

away for good.

Turnovers again hurt the Panthers, as they
committed 16 to the Wildcats’ 10, but their
offensive performance — the most points in
a victory since the Western Kentucky game
— was too much for Villanova.

Pitt returns home to face Big East cellar
dweller Seton Hall Saturday at 2 p.m. The
Pirates have lost 12 of their last 13 games.
