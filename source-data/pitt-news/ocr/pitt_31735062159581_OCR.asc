Proposed Center Site Being Readied
While University Weighs Approval

The proposed student center in Grace Reformed Church is
being readied for opening as soon as possible after the Univer-

sity approves.

A crew of nine Student Chr

tures, and generally renovating the‘
center wing of the Grace Church
“which has not been used regularly
for several years.

According to the agreement be-
tween‘ the SCF and the trustees of
the church, only one room, about
30 feet, by 20 feet, is being trans-
ferred to the Federation. for ‘use as
an office and lounge.

Wing Usable
But, according to Dick Campbell
nearly all of the Church wing will
be available to students if the
facilities have not previously been

improvement of extracurricular ac-
tivities at Pitt. ,

The first session of the leader-
ship conference will consist of
a round table discussion on the
improvement of the present system
ofactivities and the encouragement
of future leaders to think along
these /lines. Leaders in campus

One representative from each of
the _following activities will be
asked to participate: publications,
student government, YMCA, intra-
mural athletics, varsity athletics,
instrumental music, vocal music,

presence of any person connected
with Red-front organizations.” He
classified Dr. Hathway as such a
person.

Claims Reddish Visits

The judge, prominent in Polish
circles asatrustee of Alliance Col-
lege, a Polish school, charged
that she paid several visits to the
Polish consulate in Pittsburgh on
_b_ehalf of Reddish causes.

He said the forthcoming testi-
mony of George Dietze, another
psuedo-Communist FBI man, will
reaffirm her vi sits.

Judge Gunther is speaking as a
member of the United Committee
Against World Communism and the
Americans Battling Communism.

Blasted, Defended Before

The Allegheny County jurist
first teed off on Dr. Hathway last
May. when he declared that sh'e
should be dismissed for her left
wing activities, but “we have not
had the courage in Pittsburgh to do
that.”

Atthat time, a group of students,
undetermined in number but headed
-by William Kahn, now a St. Louis

promised to any other group.

Among the other facilities is a
dining room measuring about 100
feet by 30 feet.This room could be
used for banquets and could be
converted, by dismantling the
tables, into a place suitable for
small dances.

Directly above the dining room
and having the same dimensions is
a small auditorium which Campbell
believes would be suitable for
receptions. On one end of the
dining room a recreation room is
planned. The room is large enough
for two ping-pong tables, one of
which is already set up.

Other Space Available

Another room on the second floor
could probably be. used in the fu-
ture,. but is now a storage room
for church furniture.

Campbell hopes to have the
center office ready in the near fu-
ture. One living room suite is al-
ready in the room and another has
been procured.

In the meantime, representatives
of the Student Christian Federation
were planning to meet with the
dean of men and the dean of wo-
m'en sometime this week to dis-
cuss possible University approval
of the facilities as a center for
Pitt students.

Bids In, Rushees

Pick Fraternities

Capping a four-week rush period,
the 20 Pitt fraternities have ten-
dered 300 bids to 175 entering
freshmen plus interested upper-
classmen.

Today marks the home stretch of
silence week during which time
men who have been tendered bids
pick them up at the dean of men’s
office. Also during the week-long
period, no fraternity man may con-
tact a first semester freshman a-
bout fraternity pledging.

According to Lester G. Brailey,
advisor to fra_ternities, ahigher
proportion of iipperclassmen are
being rushed this semester pro-
bably because of the small size of
the freshman class.

e A complete list of fraternity
pledgeswill be released by the
,de\‘anj0f _rr_ien’s.*office on Monday. 

   

Book Mark
Proves Byron

Not Popular

It seems that Lord Byron is not
as popular here as he was in the
England of his day. -

The above statement is justifi-
able from the experience of a stu-
dent who borrowed a large, dusty
volume of the poet's complete
works Wednesday.

Browsing through the aged vo-
lume he found abookmark.Alt_hough
this is not unusual in books, the
bookmark was unusual.

It was a card advertising the
operetta, “The Tyrolean Queen.”
The date that the operetta was to
be given was April 8, 1890.
That's right, 1890.

The card announced that "tic-
kets are on sale at C. G. Woods
drug store, Sewickley, and at
Btoadberry and Eyth’s music store,
440 Wood Street.”

“objective instructor.”

Said Kahn:

“By unanimous vote the Student

of academic freedom and supported
Dr. Hathway as an unusually qual-
ified and objective instructor who
has never at any time interjected
any partisan viewpoints into her
teachings." ’

Judge Gunther again blasted the
professor of social welfare studies
last Monday at a meeting of the
Hungry Club in Dutch Henry's res-
taurant. He accused her of “teach-
ing the young folks here that there
is something wrong with this coun-
try.”

Test Cases Coming

He then followed up his charges
in an interview with The News.
‘The Judge would not reveal the
exact business of Dr. HathwaY’5
strips to the Polish Consulate.

There was indication in his talk
that Communist test cases may soon
be brought before local courts. How-
ever, he would not say whether Dr.

Hathway stands to be involved.

SC Holdovers for Next Year

Student Congress elected two
holdover members for next year’s
Congress in what was its shortest
meeting in the last two years at
last Monday’s meeting.

Don Ewart and Howard Green-'
berger were the choices to sit'in
next year’s governing body. This
is in line with Congress’ Consti-
tution which requires that two men
and two women with experience in
Congress be elected by that body
to be part of next year’s group.

The two women will be elected
after women’s clearing house when
the women will have a chance to
decide which positions they want
to run for. - l

The internal elections were held
before the nominating committee
announces the Spring slate. This
prevents the committee from nam-
ing anyone who might be eligible
for internal election.

The committees candidates will
be named approximately March 24.
This allows this Monday as the
last day for internal elections.

first time in the place of Dick Ko-

Jthen bogging down with "Caste”,

; _ the students who make up this

‘ ibrgianization raised their prestige
immeasurably with their current
-production of "Julius: Caesar”.

. _ “Caesar” is one of Shakes-

play to show that the talent pre-

's ent"on Pitt’s campus is capable

because of their envy and jealousy.
Brutus joined the intrigue a-
gainst his cherished friend be-
cause of his patriotism and
Costanza doesn't fail to show the
remorse that is in his heart be-
cause of the death of Caesar.

Experience Helps

Veteran Pitt Players experience
seems to contribute much to the
success of “Julius Caesar”..As a
majestic Mark Anthony, Jack
Schano presented the famous fune-
ral speech with assurance and
vigor. Mel Silver as Cassius is a
convincing villain and Jack In-
grim is an adequate, though some-
what weak, Caesar.

A pat on the back is in order to
Harvey Pope, director of the
Players, and Bob Prendeville,
whose first show here as techni-
cal director of the group is
"Caesar”.

Their recommendations in stag-
ing the play had much to do with
its success as a formalized drama.

The success of the crowd scene
during the funeral speeches by
Brutus and Anthony and the rap-
port between the conspirators and
audience before and after the
assassination as the plotters
change their mood from enmity to
shame are just two examples of
good theatre achieved this way.

The players worked hard on
"Julius Caesar,” and the energy
expended was well worth it. Though
much’ of the play was cut to con-
fine it within reasonable time lim-
its, the meat’ was left intact. And

Remember Pharmacy
Editor, ~
Pitt News

As a student of the University
of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy
I would like to enlighten Mr. Katz
and any other misinformed persons
who may have read his article
(Pitt News, March 7) on the "re-
novated mansion.”

The picture labeled "New Lab-
oratory” was not a new, lab at all.
In fact, it is quite the same as it
has been for years, except for a
little paint on the desk tops and
a few other minor improvements.
But I'll say no more about the
labs for they are indeed the best
part of the school.

The lounges or,recreation rooms
we "can relax in” are described..by
Mr. Katz to "resemble the Tuck
Shop.” Please! The two‘ rooms
given to male students for "re-
creation” are not furnished with
padded Tuck Shop booths
splinter-filled, unfinished benches
and tables which would put any
self-respecting picnic grove to
shame.

He also states ‘that we "can
He is so right; if you don’t mind
splinters in your fingers, and can
find room between lunch eating
students who would be grateful for
even Tuck Shop coff/ee.

Mr. Katz goes on to say "Edu-

even play cards in these lounges.” .

A carton of Chesterfields will be awarded once every two weeks for the best

Hall -- donated by the Class of
1903.” Perhaps if the writer would
have thought a second he would
have noticed 1903 was 47 years
ago. The bench-type seats which
may have been in style then have
been slightly out-dated.

That they slant downward in the
front so that during a boring lec-
ture you may find yourself on the
floor, , and that the scarred and
pock-marked writing arms on these
benches are a tiny 10 x 12 inches,
wasn’t noted. :

I could go on indefinitely on the
misleading information given by
Mr. Katz, but perhaps ‘it would be
better to give my real reasons for
writing this letter. A new building
to house the School of Pharmacy is
the hope and dream of every stu-

dent and instructor here on the
Bluff.
Although, from my prejudiced

point of view, we need a new home
more than any other part of the
University, never once have I seen
mention of this in the many articles
on the University’s expansion pro-
gram. Perhaps the reason for this
is that others, as Mr. Katz, are
misinformed.

My hope in rwriting this letter
is that you may inform both the
students and administration onihe
campus through your paper of the

true situation.

IUC Squad A

To ‘Enforce

Dinks Edict

Men's Council drafted plans last
Tuesday to enforce strenuously the
freshman dink edict.

Joe Wolfe, chairman of tge MC
customs and traditions committee,
explained that a squad of Council
members, upperclass counselors,
and members of Alpha Phi Omega
will operate atpredominantly fresh-
man classes and see to it that dinks
are worn.

According to Wolfe, the squad
will consult a master schedule of
freshman English and other begin-
ning courses in order to contact as
many first year men as possible.

Squads Check Violators

There will be some members of the
squad on duty all day, said Wolfe,
Squad members will take the names
of freshmen who do not wear dinks
and refer them to Upperclass Court
for further action. Wolfe expects
the squad to be working within a
week.

A more long range plan to put
teeth into the dink program is Coun-
cil's proposal that the freshman
class sit in one particular section
ofthe student block during the foot-
ball sea_son.

According to Dario Icardi, Tom
Hamilton has expressed approval

fice and the t.reasurer’s office will
also have to okay the proposal be-
fore further action by Council can
be taken, says Icardi. There is a
possibility that WSGA may under-
take the same idea with freshman
women.

The plans have been designed
by Harold S. Leask of Dublin,
the former director of the National
Monuments Section of the Ministry

Inspiration from Oratories

Inspiration for the room was
gained from the oratories or his-
toric stone chapels built in Gaelic-
Romanesque type architecture.
Built by native monks of the per-
iod, these have been in existence
since the sixth century in Ireland.

The committee for the Irish Room
is negotiating with a sculptor from
Dublin to copy in sandstone, the
flat-relief work carvings character-
istic of the chapels. Plaster mod-
els of the carvings are already at
the University.

I Musicians to End Tour _ 
With Carnegie Concert 

Two of Pitt's musical organizations take to the open road, A‘ 

March 26 on their annual spring tour. The two groups are the Con-

cert Band and Glee Club.

This is the first year that the two organizations will play and’
sing together on the same program. "

Their itinerary calls for perfor-
mances in New York, New Jersey
and Pennsylvania. Highlight of the
trip will be the recording of an al-
bum of official Pitt songs for RCA
Victor. The album will be called
“Songs of Pitt." It wil lgo on sale
at the Student Desk about the end
of April.

Winding up the tour will be a
home concert at Carnegie Music
Hall on March 31. Tickets will sell
for one dollar for non-students and
-'5 cents for students. The tickets
are now being sold by members of
both groups.

Music for the program will range
from the classic to the modern.
Outstanding’ feature of the concert
will be the presentation of “The
Testament of Freedom” written by
Randall Thompson.

It is a choral work for four-part
men’s voices with band accompani-
ment. Tl.e work is a musical setting
of four passages from the writings
of Thomas Jefferson. The text of
the number is strikingly applicable
to the present day events of the
world.

An innocent looking peg within

A knot hole in the wood panelled

A merican Room Veils
Its Mysterious Aspects

. By JOAN SCHEWE i
There is more to the Early American room than meets the eye.
The carved outer door of 328 C1. opens into a 17th century
American Room, which serves as both office and classroom for
Edwin L. Peterson, professor of English. There is nothing to
indicate secrecy or hidden passages in the nine by four feet brick

square nails, is the ceiling of the
room underneath.

Professor Startled

According to Mr. Peterson, the
floor boards are so old that a wo-
man's foot once broke through the
wood and startled him as he sat
in his office below.

University architect Theodore
B. Bowman said the original plans
for the Early American room called
for using all the space in one room.
When it was discovered that the
ceiling would be too high, the de-
signs were changed to include the
passages above.

One of the most famous cases
of hidden rooms is the House of
the Seven Gables, which inspired
the secret staircase in the Pitt
room.

Dean , Honored

years was acting dean of the Uni-

Of the remaining 25 per cent,
those that were signed and prepared
properly, some are not worthwhile
suggestions and can not be acted
upon, according to Lindsey.

On the whole, however, quality
of suggestions has picked up since
the fifst few days when the boxes
were first placed around the school.
They were all either humorous or

‘vulgar.

Now, according to Lindsey, ex-
pecially in the Cathedral, many of
the valid suggestions are "of good
calibre.” In the Ellsworth Center
and the Pharmacy School, though,
Lindsey has labled most of the
entries "tripe.”

In his daily “mail” he still re-
ceives his quota of "Drop dead’s,”
“Take a good jump in the lake,”
and blasts at various departments
in the school. One of the more en-
lightening suggestion forms carried
the plaintive question, "Why isn’t
Octavius our dean of men?”
Many of the valid suggestions re-
flect serious thought on some of
the minor gripes of Pitt life. Re-

quests for coke machines, juice
machine s , more coat racks, and
weekly student streetcar passes

crop up daily.

Ellsworth Center, also, has its
own all-male problems. Prevelant
are requests for more girls, pinball
machines, a juke box, table tennis,

Honor System

Omicron Delta Kappa, Mortar
Board, and Alpha Beta Gamma, ed-
ucation society, have swung their
support behind’ a proposed Pitt
honor system.

The honor system was previously
introduced in Student Congress by
Ray Maher, senior member. Maher
was then named chairman of a com-
mittee to "promote and publicize”
his proposal and committee mem-
bers were named.

At a recent meeting of the honor
group, representatives of the three
honor societies expressed their in-
terest in pushing for an eventual
student honor set-up.

In the words of Maher, the group
believes that “some type of honor
system would benefit Pitt.”

Committee members expect no
immediate response to their cam-
paign, according to M31165 Rather
the group is building for the next
semester.

Future plans include a meeting
of the presidents of the honorary
and social fraternities and societies
on campus to enlist their aid in the
project. The Interfratemity Dis-
cussion Group will put the honor
system under consideration at 8
future meeting.

Baseball Coach Ralph Mitterling is high on

George (Rabbit) Lowe is one of the first base

of Denver, Lowe fits in with Mitterling’s plans to

Although he talks of larceny with roguish delight,
Lowe looks more like a minister than one who would

pilfer anything.

The 24-year-old mittman, a sophomore in the School
of Dentistry, wears glasses on and off the diamond.
He has the academic poise that goes with a.2.5 qual-
ity point average. This average he compiled at the
University of Denver where he completed two years

of pre-dental schooling.

But Lowe isn’t a bookworm. While at the Colorado
school, he earned four varsity letters, two in baseball
and two in track. As a thinclad, he ran the SO and

Cas Cuts Down Quarterback Lis
“Mitt 1°"

Coach Says
Passing , A

A Requisite

By STAN SKIRBOLL

When Herm Meister, new Pitt line
coach, saw 240 candidates come
out for the football team, he joking-
ly remarked that "this looks like
the entire Santa Clara student body.”

Imagine how the trio of "small
school” coaches feel now. When
Len Casanova issued a call for
quarterbacks, no less than 27 re-
cruits answered. .

Of the 27, Cas will concentrate
on about eight. Although he admits
that not much can be seen from four
days of indoor practice, Cas has
already knocked off about a dozen
candidates. '

Passing 21 ‘‘Must’'

"Passing is a prime requisite
for this position,” the head coa ch‘
stated. Cas hastened to add,-how-
ever, that the boys cut from the
quarterback list will receive opport-
unities for other positions.

As for the remodeling of the
centers, Casanova feels that it is
also too early to say, but that it
appears there will be little trouble
in getting the pivotmen switched«
from‘ the direct snapback to the
handoff.

Ilampered by Mud

Meanwhile drills for the jayvee
squad, which Casanova has desig-
nated as his “second team,” he-
gan Wednesday. The muddy prac-
tice field somewhat hampered the
second phase of Cas’ spring sche-
dule. For this reason, the head
coach will utilize tomorrow morn-
ing for further drills.

There is some possibility, too,
that the gridders will- use the Stad-
ium for some of their-workouts. They
will use the outer fringe, Casanova
said, as long as they do not inter-
fere with Ralph Mitterling’s dia-
mond proteges.

In the meantime, chalk talks, the
blackboard introduction to the T are
coming along "good,” according to
Cas. The ex-Santa Clara mentor
spent Monday and Tuesday giving

the squad the general outline of
his system. . .
Tuesday the coach specialize

a little, by breaking up the team
into linemen and backs, and giving
each group special attention.

As yet, Casanova has made no

appointment to fill the vacancy in

4 Five To Go
To NCAA

Swimming coach Ben Grady will
take four swimmers and a diver
with him next Friday for the Natio-
nal Collegiate Athletic Associa-
tion meet at Columbus, Ohio.

All four swimmers will be sprin-
ters and will make up the 400-
yard relay team. The team of Jim
Zentgraf, Jules Melograne,

Jim Peterson and Dick Petro-the
same relay squad that placed a
fast second in the Eastern meet-
will make the trip.
7 Diver Al Ciocca, already ranked
 nationally, will also make the trip
to Ohio. Ciocca was nudged out of
the diving title by less than one
; point in the ECSA meet.
The NCAA will be 2-1 two day
‘ ‘affair, with Friday set for the
. qualifications. The finals will be
run off Saturday.

not toss a Buffalo into our coffers
for the displeasure. You can effect
your contempt with a smile on
your face.

In all honesty, however, it can

be said that there is a great deal
of the unusual connected with Pitt
training sessions. _

Is it customary for baseball
teams to haul out glove and bat
while February snow is still fal-
ling, and then submerge into a
dank mine shaft called the Stadium
bullpen? it -

The bullpen is located under the
Stadium bleachers. There, the
players loosen their arms,brush up
on sliding technique, practice
bunting, and freeze in the process.

Descent

Into the bullpen Baseball Re-
porter John Megella descends,
equipped with notebook, pencil,
and cap lamp, to pose weighty -
questions to Coach Mitterling.
Mitterling stands there shivering
like a plucked harp string...you
almost expect an icycle to appear
on his nose momentarily.

Megella scribbles as best a fro-
zen hand can, and then emerges
from the bullpens with the bull...
oops, I mean story. His coverage
can’t help but be fascinating, for
Pitt's is not an ordinary spring
training site. That, you cannot

deny.

The Tartan champion will be de-
termined Friday night during the
“IM Night” ceremonies. Last
year’s champs, the Architects, are
favored to reign again this season.

Volleyball interest, meanwhile,
is unusually keen here, there
being 18 independent squads con-
tending this season along with 18
fraternity units. Last season’s all-
campus East End Raider spikers-
are a favorite to retain their
laurels. _

First and second place teams
will be determined Monday after-
noon in the IM tenpin rolloffs. The
two squads will represent Pitt in’
the Gannon College intercollegiate
tournament to be held May 

-Pitt's first soccer season is
well on its way, and a call has
been sent out by IM Director Leo
C. Bemis for all students interes-
ted in ping-pong» andswimming to
sign up in the Trees Office. Soft-
ball managers are asked to prepare
their rosters. ‘

In Council

No further complications are
expected in City Council’s action
on the Pitt field house, according
to Frank Carver,
ager of athletics. 1
At the ‘present time, he alleges,
there is no city ordinance cgv—
ering the type of building that will
house Panther indoor athletics.

Carver explained that the field
house will be “a stadium with a
roof on,” something that isn’t cov-
ered by a city ordinance.

According to the existing city
law, 6'7 people are allowed per exit
in non-theater types of buildings,
while sports centers call for 90
persons per exit.

"Once the Council understands
this, and once they see that the
entire structure will be fireproof,
I don’t think there will be any fur-
ther delay,” said Carver.

The architect firm of Ingham,
Boyd, and Pratt which has drawn
up blueprints for the field house,
is presenting the case to Council.

for the Military Ball next Friday night at West View Park’s "Million

Dollar Ballroom.”

Military Ball Spotlights
Spivak at West View

Charlie Spivak, the man who blows “the sweetest trumpet
in the world,” is slated to blow that trumpet at this year’s Mil-
itaryiBall. The dance will be held in West View’s Danceland Ball-

room on March 24.

Spivak recently began recording for London records. His lat-

est release is "Don’t Cry, Joe”
coupled with "Baby Won’t You
Please Come Home.” Another of
his recent recordings is "There’s
No Tomorrow” with "Mad About
You” on the other side. Spivak
features Irene Daye and Tommy
Lynn, vocalists, on these records.
He also has a vocal group called
the Stardreamers.
Atmosphere Created

Special lighting-»and tables in
the area around the dance floor
will provide a night club atmos-
phere for the dance.

There will be no trouble about
parking and checking. Both will be
provided free of charge.

Unusual favors will be presented
to the girls. The favors are ‘being
made exclusively for the Military
Ball. Corsages ‘will definitely be
out of style .since the dance is a
University function.

and according to the Ball committee
are going fast. A

Price Reduced

salesmen. The price has been re-
duced to $4.50 including tax.

is; James Lauble, general chair-
man, Jack Neslage, business man-
ager, Art Ragen, publicity chair-
man, Leo Kairys, ticket chairman.

Ex-G‘I’s can get their uniforms
out of the mothballs to wear to
the dance or they can weather the
