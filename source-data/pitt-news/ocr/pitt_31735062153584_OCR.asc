I  Club Fmémed Friday

The Pitt-West Virginia Club of the;
University of Pittsburgh was organ-I
ized I during 1 the 1 past week by I ‘the
Native Sons of the MoIuntainIeer State,

who areattending the institution at
the p-resent.,tim.e.. The first meeting,

which wasl1*el—d immediately after as-

sembly last Friday, was attended by"

about twenty “Snake-h~u’nters.”,

The next meeting, which was held
Monday at 11.30 in room 200 Thaw
Hall, resulted in the forlmsation of a.

more permanent orga.nmation.c The

club was formed for the purpose of
welding’ together the large number of
students »who claim the Momltaineer
State as their home. The club will"
be primarily a ‘social organization,

but will also have its serious side in

which the m.embe_rs willact as boost-
ers for their Alma Mater among the
students and public generally in their
native state. 2 I
Every year there . are more;-zand
more studenitsg’ matrizculating 

West Virginia in the university. At

the present tizniie there are about fifty.

in the diﬁerent schools. They come

from all parts of the neigh-bor.ing"‘I
state, but have the bond of being

fellow-members of the one state.

"Iorganizations of this kind are nu-

merous in many of the larger uni-
versities where there are many syn-

dents from the different states. These
clubs hold their banquets and “get-
togeather” meetings; at which fhome
ties are rebound andphome subjects
discussed. They have, proved to, be
.iInﬂuentiLa.1, ob-oostors for _, their individ-
ual institutions and help boost the
men who, have graduated from their
Alma. Mater. 1 . L _

 RECALLS '01   nus

At the time of the last Varsity Let-
ter Club meeting at Trees Gymnasium,
we had the very great pleasure of

having Dr. J. H. Chessrown, Dent. ’0'1,
with us. Dr. -Chessrown, who is now
located at Youngstown, Ohio, was cen-
ter on the football . team of his day
and we have it from pretty authentic
sources. that he was mighty good.

While here‘, the Secretary had many.
pleasant chats with him and asked
that he wriCte a letter for the PITT
WEEKLY, telling of some of the
things they were upagainst in his
day developing a football team. The
letter he sent will be of interest to

day athletes. He explains that he has
been in the house for a week, with an
attack of~ tonsilitis, and, just to. pass
the time, scribbled downthese notes:

Dr. ChLessLrown-——even today»-has all
theC.-bear-marks of a great football.
player. Those who might doubt this
Lstatement should have felt his strong
right a.rm—L—hard as steel. I-leis b.uilLt
along the CCsameC lines as our All-Am-
erican. center, “Bob”. Peck, and Wilbur
Ho‘cke_nsmitLlL1 and others who played
with him say he was of the same ag-
pressive type as that star. Here is

three‘ o’clock and build a coal ﬁre in

g A Asa resuwltl of the retention of Coach
Reinecke to , train the wrestlers for
next iseason,.;,the_rev is a_»Llarge increase

that, with the wealth of material now
coming » around, and with the new
system of spring training installed,
there can be nothing short of a very
successful seaslon . , next year.

The main value "of this new system
is the experience it affords to the old
men, as well as the new recruits.
Many of thevmen now learning the
game have never been on a. mat be-

fore, ‘and Coach Reinecke claims to

have foundsome very va1uab1e‘ma-
terial among them, who, with a little
coaching, will be able to make the
squad next year. s

It was thought at first that a'nLIn-
terdepartment Wrestling Meet would
further the interest of this sport in
the school, but it is now believed that
such a- meet would not be a success.‘
A great numbergofthe wrestlers are
now engaged in baseball or track, -and
would not be willing to take a chance
of having to give up these sports.be-
cause of an injury or strain which
might result from the meet. Further-
more, the other two sports, baseball
and track, are nowlattracting the at-
tention of the students, and it is not
believed that they would interest
themselves much in this meet. A
meet will likely be held next winter.
prior to the opening of the regular
wrestling seauson, but this has not
been deﬁnitely settled as yet. A

Mr. Reinecke is now lat“the gym
and will welcome any man who would
like to enter the . game, ‘either old.
hand or‘ recruits. ’Both will have the
same chance to learn the ﬁne, points
of the sport and to make the team
next year. Anyone interested should
notify the new manager, Tom Ken-
‘dricks, Col. 13, or Mr. Reinecke at the
gym. ' R

T0 necme TEAM

 

A The elimination tournament that

’ was to have been held last Saturday

will be held this Saturday unless an-
other blizzard -interferes as it did 1.-is:
week. The matches will be staged on
the Trafford City courts‘ at Blackmore
and it is hoped that a large number
of candidates will try out for posi-
tions on the team. A number’ have
handed in their names so far but still
-there should be more men tryingeout
f.or this branch of sport. A

Last year’s captain M«cElroy and

also Manager Gaut will be out for
the Vteam. this year and the coaches

, are upagainst it in trying to get

men to take their places. Both these
men represented the University for
several seasons and were ‘instrumental
in bringing a large number of victories
to the Gold and Blue team. One of
the other men who played last year
may not be out and this will leave
another position to be ﬁlled". B

It is hoped that a number of new
ﬁnds will be unear.thed in the try-

outs. Harry Seymour and :Ed Seitzb

will act “as coaches of the team this
year and A. S. Haines has been ap-
pointed student manager. The plans
for the erection of a number of
courts are rapidly being completed
an.d it is practically assured that a
number of courts will be erected this
Spring. The lack of courts in the past
on which the members of the Gold
and Blue team could practice has
been’ a serious handicap to the team‘
and hasacted as a damper in trying
to get men out. The schedule for
the eastern trip has not been com-
pleted ’rb‘»u.t will be announced in a
few weeks. The usual matches with
the teams inVWestern Pennsylvania
will again be held. . T 1
Transportation will be supplied to
all the men trying *out for the team

to the manager or to Director of Ath-

letics C. S. 1Miller”7at the gym.
