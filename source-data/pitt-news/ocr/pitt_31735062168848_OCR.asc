Dr. Cottam Criticizes Use of Games

Theory in U. S. Foreign

by HOBART HARRIS

“Thomas C. Sheeling’s Arns
and Inﬂuence is inﬂuencing ways
of thinking that could lead to
the death of all of us,” said Dr.
Richard Cottam, reviewing the
book at the Fine Book Room of
the University Book Store. Cot-
tam was particularly disturbed
by the book’s philosophical as-
sumptions because of their in-
ﬂuence "on high administration
officials, especially Secretary of

' Defense Robert McNamara.

Cottam pointed out that much
of what has become Schelling’s
formal theory had its origins in
diplomatic games that he had
his students play while he was

,jr“;,a’t Harvard. Since that time, he

._‘:

has spent most of his time work-
ing as a consultant to many gov-
ernmental agencies. This, in ef-
fect, has created a new person—
the academic beauracrat. Cottam
feels that Schelling’s theories re-
ﬂeet this dual role; that they are
primarily designed to enable a
beauracracy to perform diplo-
matic functions. This leads, un-
fortunately, to a situation where
the public is virtually left out of
foreign policy formulation, Cot-
tam observed.

Schelling.’s theory is~a group of
basic principles concerned with
the way in which diplomats ma-
neuver, according to Cottam. The
ﬁrst of these principles is that of
credibility. Credibility refers to
thefact that when you bargain,
you must be believed.

Commitment, according to Cot-
tam, is a principle in which you"
make it very clear that you are

- going to carry out your threats;

0

"~5hle_._ “Pl,-eliminary voting .will_.

in fact the very basis of this
idea is that you deliberately ma-
neuver yourself into the position

,where you can do nothing but
this. Commitment is the mechan-

ism through which credibility is
maintained. . _

Because of the irreversible na-
ture of many of the bargaining
positions, Cottam said that Sc.hel-
ling emphasized therneed for ac-
curate communication between
the bargaining powers.

There are two ﬁnal principles,
according to Cottam. These are
deterence and compellence. De-
terence is a form of defensive
bargaining——telling your adver-
sary what he had better not do.
Compellence is a situation where
you tell your adversary what he
must do. A

Cottam has several strong criti-
cisms of» these principles. First,
he pointed out that the games
which Schelling played at Har-
vard, from which he distilled his
theory, were not direct copys of
the real diplomatic world. This
is especially true in the ﬁeld of
personnel, in the sense that the
major roles in Schelling’s games
were ﬁlled by the same people
throughout the game, while in
real life men are continuously
advancing and falling, and that

"the man we plan our policy to
influence today may be replaced
tomorrow by people who will be
intransigent to our- wishes.

Secondly: Cottam felt that this

system of ideas tends to concen-
trate our thinking into purely
military areas, with most of our
manipulations done on this level.
The bombing of Vietnam is an
example of this. "Cottam pointed
out that US policymakers felt
that intensiﬁed bombings would
break the North Vietnamese peo-
ple’s spirit, simply because it
would destroy a great deal of
their country. However, Cottam
pointed out that so far, this
bombing has “intensiﬁed rather
than killed the ﬁghting spirit of
the North Vietnamese.”

Finally, Cottam‘ felt that the

Government Senate.

For the third time,

by DAN BOOKER _
Student Government (SG) has considered
the recommendation of the Allocations Committee on‘a request by ,

the Men’s. Glee Club. But this time, the recommendation was approved
and the singing group was allocated none of an approximately $1,600

request.

Each previous time this recommendation had gone before the

Senate, several senators felt that the club should be given the money ,

to extend its Southern tour. The Allocations Committee each time
countered that it had already given the Glee Club -$2,000 for the pro-
proposedrtour ‘and that this had increased the total Glee Club budget

As though unwilling to ﬁght in

vote. -

other allocation recommendations.

A total of 299, liberal arts, undergraduate courses, 84
more than during previous‘ summers, will be offered durin.g'~._
the 1967 spring and summer sessions, the Liberal Arts ad- _
vising center announced, yesterday. ‘

According to David Roberts, liberal arts adviser, the

spring term offerings represent 74 per cent of the number‘
of courses offered during the present winter term (406). He stressed
that all ﬁgures are tentative until time schedules are issued in

Powers said it was expected.-

that fewer courses would be of-

“I Si F” Now on Sale

by MARTHA FRY

Ideas and Figures strikes again! For those who enjoy poems,
woodcuts and mystiﬁcations, the new issue of the student liberary
magazine—avacado green. 75 cents——is recommended.

It is certainly a good-looking magazine—quality paper, cleanly
printed type, plenty of art work and photography. There is not a
visually dull spread in the entire 40 pages.

Instead of short stories (there are none) Editor Leslie Hart has

chosen to publish a selection of
16 poems, making the magazine
essentially a small anthology of
undergraduate poetry. As such,
it shows the young poetry writ-
ers on campus to be working
hard and imaginatively to Write
in forms that are immediate and
their own.

They are wresting with the
ambiguous line break. Pam Rob-
inson writes: “And from that
shapelessness ice palaces can be/
built no longer.” They work with
coining witticisms such as Alex
Franks: “They march for hours,
but the hour stands.” They space
lines to suit the meaning, -and
ransack the common language for
new material.

Anne Fertik’s “Coping in the

Open” seems to me to be the best.

work in the magazine. Her mas-
tery can be seen in the econornic-
al way she makes nouns jump
through grammatical hoops. She
writes: “A summer spent routin-
ing . . . I’d' give him lunch sand-
wiches . . . He broadgrinned‘ my
name.”

My personal‘ favorite is Pam

Robinson’s “To S.W.” This short
love poem, complete with chest-
nut blossoms yet, comes danger-
ously close to mushiness, but
hangs on somehow. Indeed, I
think it is this cliff-hanging ten-
sion that makes the poem inter-
esting.

The only prose in the maga-
zine is Frank’s paper on Cezanne,
which is spotted with names, quo-
tations, and footnotes. I can’t
imagine what sort of reader this
piece is supposed to satisfy in its
present form — perhaps Frank’s
ﬁne arts instructor.

Ideas and Figures has had its
troubles with Mexican printers,
inexperienced staffs, and editors
who didn't put out a magazine.
With the editorship of Leslie
Hart it seems to have entered
a renaissance. Her decision to
print the best material she had,
whether it included a short story
or not, probably took some nerve
and is to be - commended.

Quaker Group Begins Vigil;
Hopes for Peace in Vietnam

A weekly one-hour “silent vigil
for peace in Vietnam” will begin
in the Oakland area Wednesday
in front of Stephen Foster Me-
morial Auditorium from noon to
1 p.m. The vigil will be part of a
nationwide program across the
country, initiated by the Friends
Meeting House, a Quaker group.

According to Mrs. Dorris Her-
ron of the Graduate School of
Social Work, organizer of the
Oakland vigil, the activity is not
sponsored exclusively by
Friends Meeting Houses, since
the organizing groups consists of
other individuals as well.

“The Vigil,” according to the
announcement, “is a simple pub-
lic witness of our concern for
peace. In so ‘doing, we are ex-
amining what we can do as well

7 Sophomores Pick Majors

 Coffee Hours Begin A   A I     T

by ROBERT ZAVOS

Second-term sophomores will
now have a chance to talk to de-
partmental chairman before de-
claring a major during a special
week set up by the School of
Liberal Arts.

Dr. James A. Kehl, dean of
the School of Liberal Arts, said

A that the innovation is designed
to decrease the irnpersonalization

an of a large university, and es-
z 'pecially at such an important

time. rPeviously, a studentwas
_ sent a postcard and asked to
check off his major ‘subject.

Every department in the School
01 Liberal Arts which offers’an«
undergraduate ﬁeld of study has
scheduled a coffee hour or infor-
mal discussion period sometime

have already been mailed an-
nouncements which include the
dates and places for each de
partment.

Dean Kehl also mentioned that
students who already have de-
clared a major but would like
more information about other de-
partments are also welcome to
attend. In either case students
may attend as many of the ses-
sions as they wish.

After the week is over, Dean
Kehl will survey the department
heads to ﬁnd out if they received
much of a response. In particu-
lar, he will ﬁnd out what type of
questions were asked, and if

‘ these were important to the par-
ticular ﬁeld. .

The results of the survey will
be used to ﬁnd out if the new
project‘ was worthwhile. If the

When a University begins on a new venture like the
split summer, trimester, time is the only real test of that
venture’s successes or failure. We will have to wait at least

on this. change in the academic calendar.

We would have to agree that a student can make as -

However, there is'one major hurdle and that is the

the morale that a victory Satur-
day will bring, has juggled the
lineup in order to create an at-
attack that Bucknell won’t be

Bucknell has one of the strongest

The swimmers are led by free-

captain Gary Martin, who won
 two events against West Virginia.

 The team will also depend on

boards. ‘Backing Coleman is Rod-

Wrestlers Attempt Comeback

 

Against BalancedArmy Unit

by ROY JACOBS

The wrestling season is a
month and a half old, and
it’s been exactly that long
since the wrestlers won a
a meet. The last time out,
against Navy, they didn’t
look good enough to beat Robert.
Morris. .

But after a two week layoff
.the matmen should be in good
condition -to start a comeback to-
morrow against Army—. They'll

, seek their second win in the un-

familiar surroundings» of Trees
Hall, starting at 2 p.r_n.

“Army’s about o’n- a par with
Temple,” said coach Dave -'John-
son. The Owls beat the wrest-
lers 25-12 three weeks ago.

“But I expect. a better show-
ing,” Johnson continued. “In
fact, I think we’ll do real well.”

The main reason ‘Johnson ex-
pects the wrestlers to do better
against the Cadets is that “the
weights pair up better against
them than the others. I think this
is the key factor in the meet.”

Army has won four or six dual
meets, tying Maryland and losing
only to Penn State. last week,
‘23-9. Johnson -pointed to two key
matches in tomorrow’s meet. 9

“To beat Army, Cuba, -and
Rhone’ll have to  for sure.”
As an -afterthought he added,
“Cuba’s" been meeting a lot of
tough competition.”

Cuba draws one of Army’s top
two wrestlers in Gary.Fowler at

Cagers Sna

The Panther basketball
team broke its four game
losing streak with a 63-58
win over Bucknell last night
at the Field House.

Steady foul shooting by Stan
Falenski and Pete Smith in the
closing ﬁve minutes prevented
Bucknell from getting back into
the ball game. “The one and one
helped,” said Panther coach Bob
Timmons afterwards. .“And we
had the players who could con-
vert it.” .

Playing a “top-notch” defense,
according to Timmons, the cagers
never trailed during the game.
They walked off at halftime lead-
ing 27-16 and-i_t wasn’t until the
ﬁnal moments that Bucknell’s in-
side men became effective.

Ken Bollens and Jim LaValley
had kept the taller Bucknell play-
ers away from the basket for
most of the contest. Mid-way
through the second half, Bollens
made three inside moves for six
points in an 11-4 spurt. .

‘f‘He did another good job for
us,” Timmons praised. The coach
also ‘had praise for LaValley.
“Jim got tired towards the end,
but he’s too invaluable to take
out.” Then Timmons smiled,
‘.‘He’s becoming a ballplayer.”

LaValley scored 16 points to
pace the attack. Bollens contri-
buted 14 while Bucknell’s Matt
McMonigle led all scorers with

HUGO CROFT
Faces Terry Hoover at 191.

Fowler was undefeated in ﬁve
matches at 130 and 137. Fowler,

_ who lettered as a-sophomore but
. didn’t start last year, wasn’t ex-

pected to do much in the pre-
season analysis but has surprised
so far this season. _

Rhone is -moving up_ to 160‘

where he probably will face 9

Mike Nardotti. Nardotti is only a
sophomore, but he has moved the-
Cadets’ captain, Roger Heiman,
out of the starting lineup-'. He
had won four of ﬁve matches be-
fore Penn. State.

Several lineup switches and a
new face also will ﬁgure in de-
termining a winner tomorrow.

Cliff Zolikoff moves down to
145 from 167 while Tim Trax
switches with Rhone at 152. Al
Traunsteiner will wrestle at 167
instead of 177.

JIM LaVALLEY (12) tries a hook shot for the cagers in last night’s
63-58 victory. Bucknell’s Matt McMonigle provides LaVal1-ey with
support and Steve Stevenson (44) gets position for the rebound.

18. The’ other statistics, however,
clearly show the Panther’s su-

bounded the Bisons, 39-25, and
hit on 23 of 29 free throws as
compared with Bucknell’s four of-
nine. .
The pressing Bisons were forced
to foul the eager guards, Falen-
ski..and Smith, in the game's ﬁnal
minutes. “Those two give us ball-
handling against the press -that
we didn’t have ~before,.’? explain. .
' iminons.” ~ 

  

trini and Rob McFarland spark-
ed a second half comeback, as
the Cubs handed Wesley Junior
College its second defeat against
ten wins, 71-70. ‘

Down 42-36 at the half, the
frosh took the lead, 46-45, on a
jumper by McFarland with -14:53
left. Wesley regained it 61-60

GARY FOWLER
Army’s big point getter.

"The new face is Tom Jackson
at 177. Jackson is wrestling sev-
eral pounds above his weight,
but Johnson thinks he’s in fairly
good shape. .

Jackson’s opponent is Jim Hart-
en, who was second in the East-
erns last year as a sophomore.
In addition, he won his last eight
dual matches lastlyear and pro-
ceeded to win his ﬁrst ﬁive this
season.

Army’s other top wrestler is
Hugo Croft, who wrestles both
at 191 and heavyweight. John-
son expects him at 191 where he
is undefeated this season.

Croft will meet "Terry Hoover
tomorrow. Hoover is the varsity’s
only undefeated wrestler, but to-
morrow he’ll be hampered in his
ﬁrst bid test by a minor shoulder
separation. . '

DeltsDown
Phi Ep, Tie
For Lead

As fraternity intramurals ﬁn-

ished its second week of play,

the sudden-death upset victory of
Delta Tau Delta over perennial
champ Phi Epsilon Pi highlight-
ed the action.

In the second overtime period.
of this game, Tom Barnes sank
two foul shots to seal the 50-48
victory. Brian J ontown led Phi
Ep in scoring. Phi is now 0-1.

Tied for the lead with Delta
Tau Delta is Pi Lambda Phi. They
both have identical 2-0 records.

Pi Lam has beaten Delta Sig and .

Sigma Chi. Led by Barry Mish-

kin, Pi Lam seems to be a very

strong and well-balanced team.

Sigma Alpha Mu, Delta Sigma
Phi, -and Sigma Chi are grouped
in third place, each having won
one and lost one. In their ﬁrst
‘effort in league “A” play, Zeta
Beta Tau is having _a rough time.
They have dropped their ﬁrst
two games and have lost their
leading scorer, Tom Geiger, with
a broken wrist.

In league “B,” Phi Kappa The-
ta and‘ Sigma; Alpha Epsilon are
co-leaders with 2-0 records. SAE,
led by team captain Bob Sny-
der, have beaten both Fiji and
Lambda Sig by wide margins.’

» The effective combination of cen-

ter Sam Pennella and Rich Er-
delyi have led high scoring Phi
Kappa Theta to wins over Theta
Chi and Fiji.

An athletic team so poor
in depth as the track squad
can hardly afford to lose two
of its best runners after the
first meet of the season. But
it has happened, and Jim
Banner has to do some quick
reshuﬁling before Saturay’s meet
with Penn State i.n the Field
House at 1 p.m.

Carl Wooten was running the
anchor leg of the mile relay last
Saturday against Kent. He was
far ahead, and just one more
lap would have won the race,
but as he began that lap he fell
to the track and had to be help-
ed down to the locker room.

Now Wooten is walking around
with crutches and a cast on his
right leg, out indeﬁnitely with
ripped tendons.

The other injured track is mid-
dlc distance runner Ken'Lawton.
Lawton’s legs are in ﬁne shape,
but he’s been sick for a week ,
and it is doubtful that he will be
in top form to face the Nittany
Lions.

Lawton runs the 1,000—yard run
and is a member of the two-mile
relay team. Banner considers this
relay his strongest event, but

.TEMPLE SINAI

 

now he doesn’t know where to
look for a replacement if Lawton
can’t run.

Aside from these two sopho-
mores, all of Banner’s athletes
are in top shape. He was general-
ly pleased with his team’s per-
formance against a bigger Kent

squad, but a lot more will be
needed for a victory over Penn
State. ,
Heading the Lions into Pitts-
burgh will be senior Art Morris.
Morris is their co-captain and
holds the Field House record for
the two-mile run. His 9:2-1.3 mark

is now one year old. In that same

Here's the swinging, man-sized compact for '67 that's got three B's of
its own: Bold, Brossy and Beautiful. Dart has been completely restyled
this year, inside and out. It's longer, roomier, more powerful. But still at
ihoi SW9 C0mDCICt price. Drop In at your nearest Dodge Dealer's and
try it out for yourself. '

DEAR REB:

l'm a well—known composer, and l need a new car. B
The trouble is, l'm iust too Bizet to pick one out. And
what's more, many of the new cars I see are Often-
bach in the garage for repairs. But l do have a good
friend who is pleased with his new '67 Dodge Dart.
He was given an excellent deal and Berlioz any
money on it. My Bach is to the wall. Can you help me?

I.UDWIG

DEAR LUDWIG:

My advice is that you let yourself Ravel in the enjoy-
ment of driving the sporty, all-new Dart for '67.
You'll find its Liszt price is a lot lower than you'd
expect. And even though it's longer outside and

bigger inside this year, Dart's still an easy "car to‘
Handel. ‘
