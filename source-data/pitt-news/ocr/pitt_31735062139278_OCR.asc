servatory Addresses Stu-
dents in Chapel.

A‘ LARGE ATTENDANCE

\Dr. Schl-essinger of the Allegheny
_Observa-tory addressed the faculty_
and student body at chapel last

Wednesday on the work of an astron-
omer. He said in part:

“At the present time there a
greater interest in the 'astronomer’s
work than in any other profession;
especially is this true in the United
States.

is

“Astronomy is not a theoretical sci-

ence as many believe it. to be,pbut a
very practical one. Especially in nav-
igation is astronomy very helpful.
United States is surpassed by Ger-
many and England in chemistry, but
in astronomy this country surp.asses
any other country on the globe.
i“Peopl-e in general have little
knowl.edge of an astIfonomer’s work.
He is generally thought of as a long
white—hair-ed ‘man with his eyes glued
to the telescope surveying all the
heavenly bodies. There are many
good astronomers who use the tele-
scope very little, if at all. For ex—
ample George _William Hill, a noted
astronomer, according to records, has
never looked through a telescope.
This is accounted for by -the fact that

photography is largely used in astron-

omy, now which greatly lessens the
useofli the telescope. The work of
the astronomer is not 'hap—hazard. He
prepares a deﬁnite program to fol-
low out t'he day before he begins his

E  ADDRESSES ENEINEERINQ STUDENTS

The city is situated in that splendid‘
region sometimes called -the ‘Play-
ground of the United States,’ and for
this reason thepopulation is increas-
ing at the rate of thir~ty—three thou-
sand per year.

“Under these conditions the limit of
growth would soon be reached be-
cause of the small supply of water to
which ‘the city now has access. Seven
hundred thousand people would be the
greatest number that could be sup-
plied. This made it evident that a
larger water supply was absolutely
necessary if the city was to continue
to grow in population. But the prob-
lem was not an easyone to solve for
that is a country of little rain. The
maximum rainfull is about ﬁfteen
inches per year and "it often falls -as

THE PITT

WEEKLY

TOM MOORE AND ANDREW‘
' MACK AT LYCEUM

Tom Moore and Andrew Mack, the
Irish singing actor, will
appear at the Lyceum next week. The
play, whichis written by Theodore
Burt Sayre, recites many of the ro-
mantic incidents, from the life of the
poet Moore, some of which beauti-
fully illustrate his love for Bessy
Dyke, w.hile others portray his early
struggles in his cheerless London
garret. One act onlyshows the bard
after he had come into his own .and
this represents him as the idol in the
of Lord
.Mar-ia accepting the favor of the
Prince Regent.

Whatever romantic and historic
interest the play itself may arouse,
the personality and sweet, Irish tenor
voi-ce of Mr. Mack will surely intensi-
fy. Among the songs he will sing
are “The Last Rose of Summer”
“Love’s Young Dream” and “Evelyn’s
Bower.”

GRAND OPERA AT ALVIN.

The Ab01'I1 English Grand Opera
Company has been auspiciously intro-
duced to Pittsburgh for the first week
of its season at the Alvin Theater and
has been successful beyond expecta-
tions. Many of the leading artists
willremain for the second week’s
cast-—Verdi’s “Il Trovatore”-—which
will occupy the eight performances
beginning Monday night. Several
changes will be made, however, in ac-
cordance with the Aborn’plan of ex-
changing leading ‘artists between the
different cities of their circuit.

There willvbe two extra matinees
next week, Tuesday and Thursday,

when Humperdinck’s beautiful fairy A

opera, “Hansel and Gretel,” will be
giyen for the ﬁrst time in Pittsburgh.
The curtain will rise on the Tuesday
and Thursday matinees at 3:15 P. M.,
so that schoolchildren may conven-
iently attend.

For the third week, beginning May
13, the offering will be Offenba_ch’s

' opera comique, “The Tales of'Holf-

mann.”

LOST PARADISE AT DUQUESNE

That powerful and heart—touchirig
drama, “The Lost Paradise,” is to be
the signal attraction at the Duqu-esne

i»Theater next week, when the Harry

Dxavis Stock Players will present its
famous second act strike scene in the
most picturesque style. The author of
“The Lost Paradise,” Henry C. De-
_Mille, is brilliantly remembered as
the masterly collaborator of David
Belasco in that series of play triumphs
which astonished the theater world of
America about twenty years ago.
This play is, however, Mr. DeMille’s
most «enduring work, because of the
earnest treatment of its appealing
theme.

The original production of the play
was made at the ‘historic Proctor’s
Twenty-third Street Theater in New
York, ‘November 16, 1891. It not only
gave Charles Frohman a secure hold

on ’metropolitan management, but

plac-ed Maude Adams on the high: .

road to fame. -

The entire play revolv.es'around the
restless and atilastirebellious protest
of the workers at the Knowlton Iron
Works against the inequalities be-

tween their wages and the vast sums

showered» by Knowlton upon his
daughter, Margaret—the “Pearl set by
the works.”

NEW DEVICE SEN-T
RESEARCH DEPARTMENT

The Department of Industrial Re-
search has just received an interesting
device" for measuring the amount of
heat lost in g-ener.ating steam. This
apparatus, known as the Waller Pat-
ent Blue Gas Collector, is the gift of
the Technical Bureau for Economical
Steam Production, of Rotterdam, Hol-
land, and reached Prof. Robert Ken-
nedy Duncan last week.

Few persons unfamiliar with me-

chanical engineering know the »impor--

tance of this problem« of d-etermining
the amount of ‘heat energy that is lost
by the modern steam furnace, boiler
and engine. In spite of its wonderful

achievements and of the great ‘indus-'

trial progress for which it‘ is largely
responsible, the steam engine is in
reality still a very defective -device; it

utilizes only a small part——at -rnostf

one—ﬁfth——of the heat generated by
the ___combustion of coal. Much of the
heat energy is. lost from the furnace
to the boiler, and some between ‘the
boiler and the engine proper. Hence
the remark made ‘by a distinguished
Frenc'h engineer; Le Bon, who ex--
pressed the hope, “that before twenty

years have passed, the last specimen.

of this crude machine will have taken
its proper place in museums, side by
side with the stone hatchets of our
primitive ancestors.” _

The VV;aller apparatus is construct-
ed with» a view to determining the
amount of carbon dioxide contained
in the ﬂue gases:
period of 12 hours’ continuous sam-
ples, as it were of the ﬂue gas and
indicates the average percentage of
carbon dioxide contained in the gases
that have passed up the chimney, thus
indicating whether or not the stoking
during thesei12 hours has beenidone
economically.

“The question” often arises why
Pittsburgh’ with all its smoke was
chosen as the site of a great observa-
tory. This is explained in the follow-
ing way. There are three conditions
that should exist at the site of any
observatory. They are
of too many
lights ~since.they make the sky ‘too
bright, and t-herefore interfere with
.the work of the astronomer, and
lastly, a steady condition of the air
This last condition is The most im-

exists in‘ Pittsburgh to .a great ex-
tent. ‘A ' A ~ —
“Clearnessl does not mean‘ shaky
air. The fog and smoke of Pittsburgh
acts like a blanket in keeping down
the heat radiations which disturb the
air. The air inside the dome should
be about the same temperature as that
outside of it. Thus the astronomer
often suffers much from the cold
when he works all night in an at-
mosphere below zero. _
"“Especially at Mt. Hamilton, the
site of .a great observatory, must the
"astronomers undergo many trying ex-
periences. The -place is reached only
by stage coach, and it __is necessary
-that the astronomers live all the time
on top of the mountain. In winter the

. road is often impassable and medical

aid c.annot be secured in such a con-
dition. One of the astronomers of
Mt. Hamilton had a very trying ex--
perience in this «connection. .His
daughter took sick suddenly with
diptheria and a medical aid was tele-
phoned for at once. J However, the
stage coach had departed an-d the
doctor’ iindertook the journey on
horseback. He made the trip and
saved the child’s life, but his horse
died two hours later.

“The discovery of a comet makes
the astronom-er very happy. Yet if
he does discover one he apologizes for
it by claiming that he did it accident-
ly. The greatest ambition of the as-
tronomer is to ﬁnd outtlhe future of
the earth, a matter that interests all
of us; the l.asting of the sun’s "heat
the origin of the .. stars, especially
double stars; and an explanation of
the hap-hazard scattered position of
t-he-s-tars. The astronomer’s work is
not hap-hazard. He has deﬁnite rules
to follow and speciﬁc objects to at-
tain. Yet there is no real interest in
how he attains it. The results are
what interest the astronomer" and

» CHAPEL SERVICES

_ Much comment has been,-aroused
rec-ently among the students concern-

O _ing an effort on foot to ‘enforce com-

pulsory atten-dance at chapel. With
‘regard to the Wednesday chapel‘ ex-
ercis-es, no fault can be found by stu-
dents or faculty. The attendance is
reasonably large; the speakers are
able and instructive; and the weekly
convocation has become very popular
No change should be made in this ar-

I ‘yrangement. But as regards the M-on-

day and Fri-d-ay meetings, the same
_-praise c.an not,be justly gran-ted. In
the first place, there is no incentive
for the “students to attend. No

« speakers of prominence, as a general

rule attend -these "gatherings. Conse-
quently the attendance is very small.
Nor do the students have any oppor-
tunity to attend. Many. classes are
held dur.ing this hour on both Monday
and Friday. A large proportion‘ of
the students are prevented by these
reci-tations from attendingchapel. I

Then another aspect of chapel is
the necessity for holding student
meetings -at this hour. No other hour
in the week is avaliable for under-
graduate gatherings. ‘The two hours
used at present for chapel on Mon-
days and Fridays .are the only periods
in the entire week free for the meet-
ings of stu-dent -organizations. It is
through no hostility to chapel that we
point out the -cause of the poor at-
tendance at chapel. But we feel that
it is but just tolthe students to state
the__reasons why they are not present
in large numbers. Only through fac-
ing the -facts in the facecan any real
solution of the diﬂiculty be found.\On

' _ account of classes, students- organiza-

tions, the lack of interest naturally

V-displayed in our Monday and Friday

chapel is greatly_ intensiﬁe-d. Some
mean-s must be found -by which these
vari~ous~problems may be satisfac-t-o'ri-

-ly solved. Until such .action is taken

we believe that the poor attendance
will continue on Monday and Friday.

_, OUR. BASEBALL TEAM 

As a matter of justice we‘_feel that

team to annex a larger percentage of
its games on the ﬁrst trip should be
explained. Two great handicaps pre-
vented the team from showing the
strength which was expected. In the
ﬁrst place, the faculty barred several
of our strongest men on account of
their low standing. With no desire to
object to such action, we wish to call
attention to the f.act that this is a

great disadvantage to securing a
strong base'ball team. -
Another source of troubl with

which our team has met this year has

Last Monday morning I dropped
into the baseball headquarters of the
Pitt Pirates to talk to my old friend,

fellows a bunch of horsesihoes every
game—you can’t have all ‘these things
playing against you—and still_ win
every game you play.

giving his chair a friendly dig'.with

day you play like champions, and the‘
next day you can’t hit a straight ball

“PARIAN” GLASS REFLECTORS
FOR NEW GYMNASIUM

(Continued from Page 1)
ployed for street and interior light-
ing.

-In
Cornell University for a year’s special
work in chemistry. The fall of 1905
found him on Pitt’s\ teaching staff and
since ‘then most of his time has been
given to the Department of Chem-
istry.

About a year ago Gill Brothers’
Company having experienced some
difﬁculties in the manufacture of cer-
tain colored glasses, called on Prof.
Silverman to discover the cause of
their trouble. At his suggestion they
constructed a small six—pot furnace
for experimental purposes and con-
pletely equipped a color room. They
have given him every possible facility
and as a result a number of new
glasses were obtained, among them a
new ruby and “Parian” glass.

Asked for the properties of the lat-
ter Prof. «Silverman made the follow-
ing state ent:

“In recent years the type of glass
known as translucent or semi-tra‘ns-
lucent has very largely replaced
be-
cause of the difficulty experienced in
keeping the last two clean. Opal
glasses were displaced because the
light transmitted had, a peculiar
orange or fiery tinge. The etched,
sand—blasted and opal glasses» all ab-
sorbed - large quaﬂtities of light.
‘Parian,’ so named because of its close
resemblance to the snowy-white

iParian marble, is the most advanced
. step in ‘the production of a ‘glass pos-

sessing good translucency, high re-
ﬂecting power and at the same time
transmitting the light in the original
color produced at its source.”

In addition to his practical work
Prof. Silverman has published a num-
ber of articles about glass. The com-
mercial importance of his researches
naturally restricts publication of most
Recently the Commit-
tee on Silicate Industries, of the
Eighth ‘International Congress of Ap-
plied Chemistry to be held in Wash-
ing-ton and New York City early in
September, delegated him ‘to look
after papers pertaining to glass man-
ufacture.

Prof. Silverman is one of a very
small number of chemists engaged in
the study of chemical problems relat-
ing to glass manufacture and his
w-ork is bound to reflect great credit

"upon the University.

Wisconsin is offering a course in

ESMOKE RESEARCH
TURNS TO BOTANY

New Man Is Added to Staff to Make
Study of ‘Botanical Life.

5 Among the specialists who ‘have
been engaged to study the smoke
question is Prof. J. E. Clevenger of
the State Agricultural College, where
‘he holds the chair of Botany. An ar-
rangement has been made whereby un-
der the auspices of the University of
Pittsburgh and State College, Prof.
Clevenger will rmake a study of the
effect of smoke -and SO'Olt on plant life
%with particular reference to Pitts-
iburgh. Very-little has been done thus
far w.ith regard to this particular sub--
ject, although ’in England and Ger-
many it has received considerable at-
tention. It is generally known that
gcionifers do not thrive in a smoke-
iladen atmosphere, but that Certain
lother forms of plant life grow as well
iif not better, in smoky places. It
lwill readily be seen that a careful in-
lvestigation of this whole subject will

[be of great value to persons interested

lin landscape gardening in such places

13.3 Pittsburgh, in as much as it will

ihelp to bring about a more intelligent
Eseliection of plants and flowers for
ijdecorative purposes.
i Carefully made experiments in Eng-
iland have demonstrated certain forms
,of vegetation are terribly stunted in
!their growth by soot deposits. Soot
is not pure carbon, but contains from
_l0 to 40 per cent. of -thick oil, by
"virtue of which it adheres tenaciously
to anything it comes in contact, so
.that it cannot be easily removed by
rain. It covers leaves with a kind of
varnish and ﬁlls up the pores, and
thus checks the natural process of
transmitutation and assimilation, even
though the pores are in most plants
situated on the under side of the leaf.
Evergreens suffer most in this re-
spect because they have also the
winter smoke with which to -contend.

It was found out in Leeds, Englaprl,
that 80 per cent. of the leaves of con-
ifers were choked up with tar. It is
a significant fact that some of the
ﬂorists of Pittsburgh have found it
necessary, largely on account of the
smoke and soot, to move their nursery
gardens farther and farther away from
the heart of the city.

Nebraska has nearly 1,800 women
students.

Kansas has established a course in
dancing.

given the Cap and Gown Club by the‘
student body. Far more men applied
the club this year;

than previously, so that we have been;

able to pick an exceptionally ﬁnei
chorus. The men taking parts in the;
chorus have worked-with all their

might for several months, practicing
several nights each week. This part
will constitute the most prominentl

progress as we have made this year

of his attack on the present system of
basing a tariff on the difference in
cost.-of production ‘here and abroad}
a prominent business man of Pitts-
burgh said, “ﬁe riddled it." The rem-
edy he suggested was a board, com-
mission or bureau of experts who
would be -handicapped by no particu-
lar theory of tariff legislation, but
should have at its disposal all the
means ofgetting the real facts of the

things worse the ‘rain falls mostly in
winter and therefore runs off the sur-
face, or is soon evaported. The water
falls in great quantities on the slopes

of the high Sierra Nevada mountain A

range which is once hundred‘ and ﬁfty
miles away. ‘
“While it is heavier on the western

islop-e than on the eastern, the water

cannot ‘be brought from the western
slop on account of the topography of
the country. Tunnels bringing the
water from the eastern slope of the
mountains would be too expensive.
The Ow-ens river draining the west-
ern slope ﬂows into a dead lake called
Owens lake. It was decided to tap
this lake with a -dry -conduit about two
hundred and ﬁfty miles from Los An-
geles. The water is puriﬁed by air
and sunlight and then it goes into a
closed reservoir, where it is protected
from all contamination. This conduit,
will be completed in a year, or so
and will solve this -problem of water
supply for many years.”
