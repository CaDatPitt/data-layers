Parking Eliminated In Qa 

By BILL NIEDERBERGER.

In a move to protect the pe-
destrian traﬁic coming from
the new Towers," the Univer-
sity Police have eliminated
parking, in the inner quadran-
gle. A

_Chain barriers have ‘ been
erected to enforce the new
regulations. . ~

Capt. Charles Ray of the
University Police said that he
and Safety Inspector Oren B.
Relyea had been “shocked” to
see many students dodging

called the move “one step in a
parking program planned since
the past spring with full ad-
ministration approval.” He re-
gretted that notice of.the move
was tardy. V .

If he cannot rid the. quad of“
all-day parkers and moonlight
neckers, Capt. Ray stated that
he will be forced to close off
_the whole quad area to all but
Pittsburgh National Bank park-
ers. Heladded, Parking spaces
are still available in front of
Holland Hall for a small num-
ber of cars.

WPGH will air several new shows thas fall, according
to Vasanth Bhat, program director for the. station. They will
include: “Hot Spot”, a weekly program beginning Monday at
8:25 p.m., which will enable students to express their views
on, and criticisms’ of, the University and its activities.

“The Last Laugh”, a comedy program pertaining to life

Film Series
Shows ‘Rififi’
This Friday

Student Union Board will pre-
sent Riﬁﬁ the second ﬁlm of the
fall series Friday at 7:30 and 10
p.m. in Clapp Hall. Student in-
v6ices are not necessary for free
admission.

Rtﬁﬁ, a French mystery with
English subtitles, is directed by
Jules Dassin. Dassin is the famed
director of Never on Sunday and
Phaedra.

A motion picture classic,
Riﬁﬁ is noted for its dramatic

silent jewel robbery scene.

The ﬁrst ﬁlm of the fall series,
From Here to Eternity, was “ex-
tremely well attended” said Stan-
ley Schweiger, Film Series chair-
man. “There were full houses for
both the 7:30 and 10 p.m. shows.
I hope that this high level of at-
tendance and the student enthu-
siasm for the Friday night ﬁlms

at Clapp Hall will continue‘

throughout the year.
“The double showings enable

twice as many Pitt students to

attend the movies this year.”

V in. the next few weeks.

 

¢at the University; and “The Greek

System Presents,” a variety show
which will alternate weekly with
“The Last Laugh,” occupyingthe

7:35 to 8 p.m. time spot starting

Tuesday.

“The Greek System Presents’-’ is
produced by a joint effort of the
fraternities and sororities at the
University, and, in vBhat’s opinion,
“will not only promote the Greek
systems, but also serve as the
Greek’s contribution to the Uni-
versity.” ,

Bhat also said, “In my opin-
ion, the sororities are more en-
thusiastic about this program
than the fraternities.”

When asked why he held this
view, he replied, “The sorority
representative, Joan Chenoweth,
has been keeping in touch with
WPGH, and the ﬁrst program will
be presented by three sororities.

“ ‘The Greek System’ is a two-
wheeled cart,” added Bhat. “One
wheel has already been placed by
the sororities, and the other wheel
is yet to be supplied by the fra-
ternities.” ‘

Miss Chenoweth said she felt
the fraternities had simply ne-
glected to bring the subject up at
the last meeting of the Inter-Fra-
ternity Council, and that she ex-.
pects them to become active with-

  
 

ing up dates, Capt. Rayfelt

ally-parked cars will be towed
away. .;

Admitting that there would
be a traffic problem on
weekends for students pick-

that the problem could be
minimized with student co-
operation. He advised girls
to be ready to leave at the
time their dates arrive so- as
not to jam up the quad with
cars parked for ten‘ to 15
minutes.

‘I/ldmission Director Views Learning

PM To Jump Tomorrow

Jazz 80 will receive its official informal kick-
off tomorrow evening at 8 o’clock when the Char-
les Bell Trio (plus one) invades" the Student Un-
ionlower lounge for a session in jazz, the ﬁrst
program in the SU Board's PM Series.

Billed as a three-credit course for non-music
majors to help fulﬁll inter—disciplinary require-
ments, Jazz 80’s spokesman is Joe Centifanti.

Centifanti explained the procedure for the
eyening:

" No Chairs

“There will be no chairs, and refreshments’

will‘ be served. Bell will play and lecture inter-
mittently.” . ‘

Charles Bell’s stopover Friday night is but
one of many jazz junkets he has made. A
graduate of Carnegie Institute of Technology
and recent recipient of a John Hay_ Whitney
fellowship for advanced study at Tech,‘ Bell
is perhaps best known in jazz circles for his

I “Concerto in Miniature” -4 a concerto for
jazz quartet and symphony orchestra.

.The trio played at the Newport Jazz Festival
and copped top honors at the Georgetown Uni-
versity Intercollegiate Jazz Festival in 1960. A
State Department tour in the summer of ’62
brought the group to the Scandanavian countries
and the famed Helsinki Youth Rally.

The trio, which will be a quartet on Friday,
consists of Bell, piano; Tommy Sewell, bass; a

. drummer and a guitarist. —

' Latest album recorded by the group for
Atlantic Records is “Another Dimension.”
They will appear in Town Hall (N. Y.) in
November.

A full slate of events has been lined up by
the SU Board for the trimester. In addition to
the dance scheduled for- Saturday night, a Forum

Series is slated for next Monday. And, of
course, Sept. 28 will mark the football team’s
home opener, which will be followed by a dance.

‘Jazz   80’ Will Feature Trio  H

Forum Set For Monday

The Forum Series will present Everard
Pinneo, Director of Admissions, discussing “An

Aﬁmission’s Viewpoint of the Matter of Learn- ..
ing” Monday, at 4 p.m. in the lower lounge of 7'

the Student Union.

Pinneo’s commentary» will be concerned with‘

the totality of student experience at a univer-

sity, rather than the psychological process of I A if T" T

learning, according to Michael Marcuse, Forum
Series chairman. Marcuse described ,Pinneo’s
material for the lecture as “speciﬁcally usable’_'
information. '

Marcuse continues, “We feel that the Forum. I

Series should have as its main theme this year,

' ‘student responsibility.’ It'is our belief that the‘ 
Forum Series should delineate what is meant by _

student responsibility and give students the op-
portunity to act on that deﬁnition.”
Second Forum Scheduled

The second of the Forum’s “Awareness” ser-V V.
ies, entitled “To Know Is to Be _Responsible?’’:. \
‘will take place September 30, at 4 p.m. in the

SU Suppr Room.

It will feature a panel discussion consist-
ing of six members and a moderator. Two of
the six members will be students, two will be
faculty members, and the remaining two will
be community leaders of Pittsburgh.

The)’ will present two opinions, the “liberal”.
and the “conservative” View on such questions
as: “should students demonstrate for
and others.

'1 ‘Pitt Platform’ Planned

The Forum Series has planned several politi-
cal debates, beginning with a “Pitt Platform”
October 14. Dr. Albert Martin, Dean of the
School of Liberal Arts, will speak at this pro-

gram, while prominent political leaders will -be

featured at later dates.
There will also be programs commemorating

     

both Brotherhooclweek and International Week,

  Grants from iWPDU  

By NANCY DELANEY ' ‘

 

Debaters from Florida, New Jersey, and Pittsburgh have
,-won the four William Pitt Debating Scholarships awarded
by the University to this year’s freshman class.

_ The recipients were Donald Leet, a history major, and

rGerald Dzura,~both of whom debated for three years at

Central Catholic- High School; Martin Engels, who debated

for two years at Miami Beach and:

in majoring in political science;
and Joseph Bednar, a three year
debater at Woodridge High School’,

New Jersey and‘ a physics major.

Commenting on the qualiﬁca-
tions of the four scholarship win-
ners, Dr. Robert Newman, ad-
visor to the William Pitt Debating
Union, remarked, “We expect
them to be scholars ﬁrst and de-

,'baters ‘second; and as debaters,

we expect them to be the equal
_of any in the country.”

The precise amount of the
scholarship for each debater de-

’pends_ on his need and academic

qualiﬁcations. The scholarships,

Twhich are the ﬁrst of an annual

series, are tenable until the stu-
dent graduates, assuming satis-
factory academic performance and
participation in debate, acording.
to Dr.’Newman. ' ‘

All four of the debaters at-
I tributed their interest in the ac-
. tivityto the intellectual stimula-
’-‘Vtion and competition it pro-
-vvides. “It’s an outlet for the aca-

according to Dzura.

“And we also enjoy winning!”
,«added Leet.

According to Dr. Newman, the
Debating Union “expects the pres-
ence Of a group of scholars like
these with an interest in debate
to contribute substantially to our
public debates, our intercollegiate
contests, and our intramural ac-
tivities.”

  Book Exchange S

Receipts Total
22 50 Dollars

Receipts for the Student Gov-
ernment book exchange total
$2250 with approximately 750
books sold. These ﬁgures com-
pare very favorably with last
year’s total, ﬁgures of_ $3000 for
the .fall' and winter book ex-

changes according to Jerry Hogan,
exchange chairman.

“We are impressed with the
results of the book exchange, but
there were a large number of
bookseleft over, due to the many
textbook changes,” he explained.

“When students come to get
the money for their books that
have been sold, ten cents will be
deducted from the selling price.
However, if the book was sold
for less than 50 cents, a nickle
or less will be charged,f’ con-
tinued Hogan. This means that
SG will make 20 cents on each
book, because each buyer pays
an extra 10 cents when he buys
a book at the exchange.

No Proﬁt V Made

Hogan stressed that SG “did
not make a proﬁt last year even
though it was the best book ex-
change we ever had. ‘Expenses
are high,” he said, “especially
with the kind of receipt’we_use.

“This time we had trouble
gettingpublicity for the ex-
change because of our limited
budget. T-he extra ten “cents on
each book sold should ‘make us
break even and possibly will
give us something toward pub-
licity next time to make a better
book sale,” Hogan added.

Returns will be handled next

_Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thurs-
day _in 306 SU from 9 a.m. to
4' p.m.
either the‘ money or the books
the students put up for sale will
be returned.

The procedure for lost books
will be better organized this
year. A special form will be ﬁlled
out and records kept, Hogan con-
cluded. ‘

Editorial. Labeled
.. ‘Dangerous’

j Editor, The pin News:
‘t In conscience, I am compelled
to -reply to your“editorial of
‘ Septemberll, 1963. On the sur-
face ‘it appeared to be very in-
sipid,- harmless, the height of
 mediocrity, and not worth the
A paper it was written on. After
" re-reading‘ and giving much
thought to the article, phrase by
- phrase, and word by word, I
feel that the editorial was a very
dangerous type of literature.
_ Prejudice is an injustice that
f has imprisoned man’s intellect
_ _ and body foracenturies. On the
“moral question, racial prejudice
' and segregation is an evil that
cannot be made right. In your
 editorial you did much to .dis-
_s tort this premise. I ,
The Negro youth is now shed-
ding himself of this intellectual
 imprisonment. ‘Your philosophy
by_ your thought, word‘, and deed,‘
is resisting our deliverance, for
the editorial condemmed some
students on campus for their work
in-- trying to bring -true democ-
racy to this area.
_ The article further condemmed
. these students for bringing these
problems to the attention of the
public. To add insult to injury,
, you suggested that these students
'best‘ leave this adomocratic and

 - .’Au'd.iencestL"ack Respect... in H
I   Pseudo-Cultural City

If Leonard Bernstein and the New York Phil-
harmonic‘ Orchestra never return to the Civic
Arena, the people of Pittsburgh will have re-
ceived a just reward. This city, supposedly in the
midst of a cultural rebirth,
does not deserve performances»
by‘ artists of Bernstein’s calibre.

Bernsteinwas not up to par
Sunday afternoon as he con-
ducted Mendelssohn’ and Bee-
thoven before the four or ﬁve
thousand" people ‘under the
arena’s umbrella dome. But it
was not, to be sure, his own
fault. He did not, in fact, even

would be? . ~

When Bernstein made his ﬁrst appearance, he
walked to the podium, received his applause and
raised his-baton to begin the ﬁrst piece, Mendel-
ssohn’s Symphony No. 4, the Italian Symphony.
He then had to stop and wait so that the people
who were still coming in could ﬁnd their seats.
He waited‘ for a .full minute — and then he
walked off. A few minutes later, when the noise
in the arena had subsided, he returned and began
the program. ‘

Ushers Finally Smortenllp ‘ - 1

By this time, the ushers had gotten a little
smarter, and were holding the latecomers at the
gate. There was therefore, another long delay

between the ﬁrst and second movements of the‘

symphony and another between the second and
third. It wasn’t until the Philharmonic had al-

most completed the third movement that everyone _

was seated. ;

The same thing had happened when the Pitts-
burgh Opera, with Lucine Amara as’ guest so- .

prano, performed Madame Butterﬂy at Syria
Mosque. A talking, shufﬂingand otherwise noisy
audience did not ﬁnd,’ all of its seats until the
ﬁrst act was almost half ‘ﬁnished.

How audiences, which profess such great in-.

terest _and enthusiasm "in things cultural and ar- ~

 

By Stan Stein

tistic, can be so rude and unappreciative is in-
comprehensible. Pittsburgh audiences show not

the least respect or reverence for great artists and ,

accord them not the commonest‘ courtesy ‘of
arriving on time. ‘

As far as the performance itself was con-
cerned, the Civic Arena seemed to. pose the
biggest problem. As one with a second-tier seat,
I was “privileged” to hear the symphony twice -
the ﬁrst time from the stage, the second time as
the sound bounced off the ceiling half a moment
later. In short, the acoustics are terrible.

Bernstein Was Main Attraction ‘
Leonard Bernstein himself, of course, was the
main attraction, and he provided a_n interesting
study in conducting. "His assistant, conductor was
Mr. Seiji Ozawa, a Japanese genius, and the con-
trast between the two conducting styles was
striking. Bernstein’s style consists of an array of
complicated vibrations which start in his feet and
travel all the way up to his head. At times it

almost looked as if he were doing the _freug.,

Several times it appeared that \he was one-half
step aheadiof the orchestra. The musicians, how-
ever, failed to notice this discrepancy and" con-
tinued to play smoothly. s '

Ozawa, on the other ‘hand, was very easy to
follow. When his arms descended, a note from
the orchestra always followed. Where Bernstein
vibrated, Ozawa bounced. He jumped, jabbed and
he pointed. During the particularly powerful pas-
sages, he raised both arms over his head and
brought them down as if he, were executing a
body slam.

That is not to say, lnawever, that Ozawa out-
did Bernstein. Besides vibrating, Bernstein also
jumped, jabbed and pointed: He tapped his feet,
bent low to the ground and salammed whenthe
should. But his hair stayed remarkably in place,
even after Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony, which is
exactly his cup‘ oftea.

This was the fault of the audience. They did
not give either the Philharmonic orits conductor
a warm, or at least courteous reception. This city
will not be born again culturally until the pseudo-
appreciation of its people becomes genuine respect.

’ I

For the past two years builders, contractors,
electricians, and any other kind of workmen you

i care to,name, have banded together to see that

the new towers dormitories would be completed

in time for residence this term.

Included in the. blue-prints
were plans for two new cafe-
terias.

The use of these cafeterias ;
have brought many comments,
mostly unfavorable.

The major complaint is con- A

ticket  holders are divided.
Sincethere are two cafeterias, ‘
it is necessary to split ‘the

number of students holding

meal tickets in half. But why was the split made
in such a way that all the odd numbers must go
in one cafeteria and all the_ even numbers, the

 

‘ other?

Hard to Find Others

Certainly it is true that students may eat in
either cafeteria, but it is still hard to ﬁnd someone

when several members of a group go in one side ’

and the rest of the group, the other side. The
main objection to this method of dividing the
holders in this way is that by ‘splitting the odd
and even numbers, all roommates were separated
so that they can not go into the cafeteria together,
mainly because roommates always have consecu-
tively numbered meal tickets. ’

This problem could be easily alleviated. Last
year there were two lines leading into the SU
cafeteria. One‘ ‘was for high numbers and the
other for low. This same arrangement could be
employed this year and it would make plenty of
people a lot happier. B

Not only can’t friends go into the cafeteria

together, they can’t ﬁnd any of their other friends.

  Cafeteria

By Jacki Katz

By necessity, the cafeterias are round, with
the elevators, stairs, and just plainwall in the
center. This makes for many problems. Students

‘ may arrange to meet their friendsin, say, Cafe-

taria A. This is all well and good, but since the
cafeterias are rounded, it is ‘impossible to see
everyone who is in them. V

The third major complaint about these new
feeding places is the length of the lines of stu-
dents waiting to getfood. Last year, in an7inter-
view, the director of Saga Food Service reported
that there would be eight service lines, four in
each of the cafeterias.» To date I have only seen
two lines.in each cafeteria and sometimes one
seconds line in each. The only time all four lines»
in one cafeteria were in operation was before
classes started when only one cafeteria was open.
Where are the eight lines? They ,would alleviate
the congestion problem. ‘ “F5 ”

Wait Upstairs Doesn't Help I 1

Adding to the wait downstairs is the wait up-

stairs, especially on the even side. Since the cafe-

teria is open to guests as well as those.-who have
meal tickets, it is necessary‘ to have change at the
entrances so that people may pay. But why are
the paying people only allowed to go in the even
side? -Why can’t they_go in both sides? Or better
still, why can’t they pay for their meal at the
towers desk and just hand the checkers a ticket
admitting them to the cafeteria. That way they
could go through the same line. as the friend with
whom they came, instead of having to meet
downstairs and possibly getting lost.

These are the major complaints about the new

_cafeterias. There are others, but these are the ones

most resident students are constantly griping
about.

A few weeks ago, a University administrator
stated that it would probably take at least a year
to iron-out all of the ﬂaws in the new dorms. It

. _shouldn’t take that long to iron out all of the

     

  
  
 
 

s that exist _in‘_ the _ _ca__f_ete_rias."

ONCE MORE UNTO THE BREACH,
DEAR FRIENDS
Today I begin my tenth year of writing this column in your

campus newspaper. Ten years is along time; it is, in fact, what
some scholarly people like to call 9. decade-from the Latin

word dcccum, meaning the ﬂoor of 3. ship. It is, to my mind,’

remarkable that the Romans had such a. word as deccum when
you consider that ships did not exist until 1620 when John

Alden invented the Mayﬂower. Alden, a prodigiously ingenious ,

man, also invented the ear lobe and Pocahontas.

Ships were a. very popular mode of trave1—especially over
water—until 1912 when the Swede, Ivar Krueger, invented the
iceberg. Krueger also invented the match, which is a good
thing, because without the match, how would you light your
Marlboro Cigarettes? I cannot overstress the.importance of
lighting your Marlboro Cigarettes, for Marlboro Cigarettes,
unlighted, provide, at best, only limited smoking pleasure.

I 

._‘_‘,'..4‘

‘~10. zzzuzerz and  mall

I mention Marlboros because this column is an advertise-A

ment, brought to youthrough the school year by the makers
of Marlboros. Marlboros come in soft pack or Flip-Top box.
The makers of Marlboros come in dark suits with thin lapels
-except on weekends when they come in yoke—neck"jerseys
and white duck trousers. White ducks come in ﬂocks. They are
primarily fresh water dwellers, although they have been suc-
cessfully raised in salt water too. Another salt water denizen
I’m sure you will ﬁnd enjoyable is pla.nkton—a. mess‘ of tiny

. organisms like diatoms and algae and like that. which ﬂoat
sluggishly near the surface of the sea. It is ironic that these
creatures, microscopic in size, should supply the principal
source of food for the earth’s largest animal, the whale. Whales,
I must say, are not at all pleased with this arrangement, be-

Tcause it takes the average whale, eating steadily, 48’hours to
gather a day’s meal. This leaves them almost no time for
water sports or‘ reading Melville. It is a lucky thing for all of
us that whales a.re unaware they are mammals, not ﬁsh, and
could, if they tried, live just as well on land as in water. I
mean, you, add ten or twelve million whales to our Sunday
traﬁic and you would have congestion that makes the mind
boggle. ' '

l_3ut.I digress. Today, I was saying, I begin my tenth year of
writing this column for Marlboro Cigarettes in your campus’ I
newspaper. I will, in each column, say a few kind words about

Marlboros—just as you will, ‘once you try that ﬁne tobacco
ﬂavor, that pristine white ﬁlter, that supple soft pack, that
infrangible Flip-Top box. These references to Marlboro will be
brief and unobtrusive, for -I do not believe in the hard sell.
What I favor is the soft sell,_—you-might even call it the limp
or spongy sell. I hasten to state that the makers of Marlboro
in ten full years have not once complained about my desultory
sales approach. Neither have they paid me. .

_ But that is of small consequence. Aside from ﬂeeting mentions
of Marlboro, this column has another, and more urgent, mission:
to cast the hot white light of free inquiry upon the vexing
questions that trouble college America—questions like “Should
the Student Council have the power to levy tariiis? and “Are

roommates sanitary?” and “Should housemothers be com-

celled to retire upon reaching the age of 26?”

Perhaps, reasoning together, we can ﬁnd the answers. Per-
haps not. But if we fail, let it never be said that it was for
want of trying. a '

I thank you.

umn-—and also happy to bring you fine ﬁltered Jllarlboros;

_ The Panthers’ opponents compiled a 4-6 record last year.
Among their victories was a major upset over highly ranked
Ohio State. The Bruins also defeated Colorado State, Utah, and

Intramural athletics

take a step forward tomorrow I
when director Leo Bemis pro-I
‘poses a revolutionary plan

  

which will en-

" the Pittsburgh
 arealinto three
E geographic sec-
tions, which

Leo Bemis

     

Will will have the natural boundaries

of the city’s three rivers. Bemis
asks that all comrnunting students
intertested in athletics attend the
meeting in room 524 of Schenley
Hall at noon.

“There are a lot of commuters
and off campus students who
now ﬁnd it difficult to get into in-
tramural, athletics because of the
present engineer and_ fraternity
system,” Bemis said.

Could Be New" League

“Each geographical area would
comprise at least one new team
on each area," Bemis said. “Of
course, if we get more entries,
this could comprise a new league.”

 

..Leo Bem is   to Eécpand tram

Bemis hopes that this new
system will provide a means
to participate in intra-
mural play for students who
were unable to join teams in the
past. .

“I also hope that this new sys-
tem will provide a means for hav-
ing intramural ping-pong, swim-
ming, and track,” Bemis said. "‘I

‘hope this develops into a separate

league, like-the engineers and the
fraternities.” ~
Experts Stronger Independents
Bemis, who expects the new
system to result in a stronger in-
dependent league than in past

    

    



years, blames "the new dormitor-
ies for the weakness in this year’s
independent league. “The new
dormitory system is siphoning off

dependent league,” Bemis said.

Bemis expects his new ‘sys-
tem to lead to increased parti-
cipation in other University ac-
tivities. “If these geographic-
groupings work out well, these ‘
teams might eventually form
clubs which could hold their
own affairs, and‘ function al-
most like a fraternity.”.

“Dean Crafts went along with
the" idea, and will cooperate with

the leadership needed for the in—.

us if the system works out,”
Bemis ‘said. ‘ "

Bemis then went on to explain
why he felt this type of system
was needed at the University.
“Each time we start a sport, guys

call me who want to get a team. .
All I could tell them in the past O

was to call a manager of one of
the teams and ask for a tryouﬂ
Now, with this new system, a stu-
dent will have a team to play
on.”

“This is the ﬁrst time the in-
tramural program has undergone
such a change,” Bemis concluded.
“It's the ﬁrst time we’ve tried

_ something really new.”

In a tension packed thriller at
