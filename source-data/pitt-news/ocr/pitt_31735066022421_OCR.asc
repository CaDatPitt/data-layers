Sliding about 6,000 pieces of campaign
literature under residence-hall doors in
“Operation Dorm Storm” was just part
of the University Democrats’ campaign
for newly elected Sen. Harris Wofford,
said UD President Joel Leonard.

Yesterday Leonard held a 14—foot—tall
red “WOFFORD” sign on a street corner
near Hillman Library, amid shouts of
Obscenities and support.

A Last night it all paid off — Wofford
defeated former Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh by S6 to 44 percent.

“I see some real things happening 
tax cuts for the middle class and more
opportunities for financing higher

Um'versz'ty’s Faculb/Assembly opposes open records bill

By David T. Welch

and Lisa Raff
T be Pitt News

The Faculty Assembly voted 12
to nine last night against
supporting the Cowell Bill, which
would require state—related
universities to release all
budgetary and administrative
salary information to the public.

Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs Professor

 Robert Norman said the bill is

necessary to keep the faculty
informed.

[would be made public]. The
Faculty Senate does not get all of
the budget books, and many of
the decisions that faculty must
make rely on that information,
and we really are not able to

make decisions without that
information,” Norman said.

Frederick Gottlieb of the
biological-science department
said the Cowell Bill would release
too much information.

“Opening Pandora's Box to get
one item may cause many
problems,” Gottlieb said.

Former United Faculty

“Essentially, everything
connected with budget decisions

President Philip Wion said the
result was “very disappointing.

In fact, we know from a petition
there are many faculty members,
students and staff who support
openness at Pitt. Ultimately, I
hope the bill will be passed to
help not only the public but the
University of Pittsburgh as well.”

Though the bill did not get
support from the Faculty
Assembly, Norman said‘ he is
confident that it will still be passed
by the state legislature.

“I don’t think it is a big problem
because there is strong support
among students and people who
want to know where the money
is being spent. It passed 202 to
one in the House. The Senate

Education Committee has to send
it to the floor [to pass the billl,”
Norman said.

The Faculty Assembly also
voted 16 to seven to table a
resolution to recommend that no
administrators receive fringe
benefits, such as low-interest
mortgages, augmented medical
benefits, supplementary
retirement beneﬁts and early
salary payment, which are not
already given to faculty.

President of Administrative and
Policy Studies James Mauch did
not support the resolution, but

administration and faculty
concerning delegation of fringe
benefits.

“Instead of suggesting
administrators receive no fringe
beneﬁts, let's open it up and let
the University Senate decide when
[fringe benefits] are deserved.”

Physics and astronomy

‘ Professor Allen Janis said such a

resolution would only hinder

relations between the Board of

Trustees and faculty members.
“Passing specific resolutions

may not only be useless, but [it] ‘

may also be seen as petty

Golden ﬁelds students ’ questions

By Cristine McCauley
Staff Writer

Leadership and accountability
topped the ‘list of concerns
Student Government Board
presidential candidate Gil
Golden expressed at a forum
last night. ,_

“Leadership is my first
concern,” said Golden, who is
running unopposed. "I want to
try to do some of the things
other presidents have neglected,

S such as having biweekly

meetings with the chairpeople.

This was definitely not done by

former presidents,” he said.
When board members are not

. fulﬁlling their responsibilities or

their campaign promises, the

president must step in, according
to Golden.

Accountability is Golden's
second concern, he said. “I want
to encourage an open-house
policy. At the beginning of each
term I would like to have
meetings — open, relaxed
discussions — for all students. I
want to really encourage student
participation and involvement,"

Golden said. Opinionsurveys ‘

are worth using when the
opportunity presents itself,
according to Golden.

The President’s Council is a
program Golden said he wants
to continue. “The council may
only consist of eight full-time
members, but a meeting can be
called anytime. These members

represent a large number of
people,” he said.

The schedule for President's
Council meetings will become
more easily accessible when the
SGB bulletin board outside of the
Towers lobby is completed,
according to Golden.

The President's Council
‘replaced the Representative

Student Council, which wasfan ’

advisory body consisting of heads
of student organizations. The RSC
wasxdisbanded because of small
turnout, according to Golden.
“The RSC meetings were also
open, but we had little turnout.
The meetings were every week,
and we wasted a lot of time and
money advertising, " Golden said.

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Wednesday, November 6, 1991

Byjonathan Bloch
For The Pitt News

“No means no" was the message
guest speaker Mike Disser
stressed at the Creek 101 meeting
at David Lawrence Auditorium
last night.

Disser, a representative from
Delta Sigma Phi national fraternity,
said a campus rape is reported
every 24 hours and one out of
four college women have either
been raped or have had someone
attempt to rape them.

Disser told the audience of
approximately 100 students about

a rape which occurred on another '

campus.
“At 10:30 p.m., Tom noticed
Marcy entering his fraternity party.
She had a reputation on campus
for being loose and easy. Tom,
being the social chairman, offered
Marcy a beer. At first she politely
refused, but eventually Tom
encouraged Marcy to play
‘quarters,’ a drinking game.

"At 2:30 p.m., Tom invited
Marcy to his room to listen to
music. As Tom and Marcy went
upstairs, his brothers winked at
him and gave him the good-luck
sign. In his room Marcy and Tom
began to kiss. As Tom became
more aggressive, Marcy pushed
his hand away, finally saying,
‘No, Tom. Please. No.’

“Tom continued to fondle
Marcy, slowly pushing her down
on the bed. Marcy began to cry
out, ‘No, Tom. Please stop.’ Tom
took a pillow and pushed it over
her face, muffling her cries and
her yells. Under the pillow tears.
streamed down Marcy’s face. She
laid in shock while Tom violently
raped her.

"Two hours later Marcy
gathered her clothes and snuck
out the back of the fraternity
house, hoping that none of the
brothers would see her. The next
day two policemen showed up at
the fraternity house and arrested
Tom on allegations of rape, “

ox

Disser said.

This was one ofthe 6,000 rapes
that occur on college campuses
yearly, according to Disser.
Because of that high number,
fraternities should not have the
attitude that “it will never happen
to us,” he said.

Disser relayed an experience
he had with date rape at his
fraternity when he was in school.

Disser was the president of his
fraternity dtiring his senior year

at Western Michigan University,

and one of his brothers was

accused of rape. '
According to Disser, the brother

was an excellent student who

had graduated 21 year early from

high school.

I-le was a known womanizer
and used to talk about his sexual
exploits at fraternity meetings.
One night, during a party, this
brother went upstairs with a
young woman. J

The next morning she accused
him of rape. The brother was

Fraternity representative warns of date rape

blackballed from the fraternity
five weeks later.

Disser encouraged the
fraternities to take protective steps
to prevent rape.

He suggested setting up an
escort service and passing out
buttons at parties that say, “No
Rape Tonight."

“No means no, and when a girl
says no, you should give up and
walk away,” Disser said.

“Ask your partner, ‘Are sure
you want to do this?’ It may
sound hokey, and people may
say it's not romantic, but what's
so romantic about getting a 12-
pack, slugging it down, and going
upstairs after getting nasty and
raping someone? Is that romance?
I think not.”

One woman summed up
Disser’s message when she
shouted from the back of the
auditorium, “No means no. Just
because you’re drunk, no
doesn’t mean yes. No still means
no.”

Senate

Continued from page 1
less optimistic about Wofford’s
ability to represent Pennsylvania
in the Senate.

“We feel sorry for our state, to
be honest,” said CR public-
relations director Jonathan
Kurland. But “there’s always '94,”
he said.

With 91 percent of the precincts
reporting, Wofford had won 56
percent of the vote or 1,671,695
votes. '

Thornburgh, a former
Pennsylvania governor, received
44 percent of the vote, or
1,353,975 votes.

“This victory sends a loud and
clear message  to George Bush.
He's not safe,” Leonard said. “We
can defeat George Bush in ’92.”

UD Vice President Shawn
McClearn was also optimistic
about the victories of many
Democratic candidates for county
and city government.

“The county’s in solid ﬁnancial
shape,” Leonard said. “lCounty
Controller] Frank Lu cchino made
sure of that. The people of
Allegheny County and the city of
Pittsburgh realize that overall we
have a very effective
government.”

Wofford’s main issue has been
a national health—insurance plan,
and to attack it Thornburgh has
partially diverted" his campaign
from its intended focus of
decreasing crime and increasing

employment. Thornburgh has
said Wofford’s health-care plan is
unrealistic and would lose jobs in
Pennsylvania.

Wofford’s plan is also
impractical, according to Kurland.
Actually paying for national health
insurance “became a minor detail”
for_Wofford, he said. “That really
worries us. That is one of the
ways the country got in the mess
it’s in.” .

The CRs have been active in
Thornburgh’s campaign, assisting
his “Victory ’91" million-piece
mailing over the past week. As
well CR3 also displayed large
Thornburgh signs on Fifth Avenue
and helped in the candidate’s
ﬁnance office.

The special election to fill the
late John Heinz’ Senate seat has
been characterized as a
mudslinging fest, where
Thornburgh painted Wofford as
a liberal former Bryn Mawr
College president who
mismanaged the school into
massive deficits. Thornburgh has
also negatively associated
Wofford with Gov. Robert Casey's
administration.

Casey appointed Wofford to
succeed Heinz in April.

Wofford has emphasized
Thornburgh’s “passive” role as
attorney general in the BCCI bank
scandal, the Wichita abortion
controversy and the savings and
loan crisis.

But Student Republicans and
Democrats said their candidates
didn’t engage in mudslinging.

“People confuse negative
campaigning with exposing the
negative record of the opponent,”
Kurland said. “The electorate has
the right to know the opponent,
including the negative aspects.
After all, this is politics, notSunday
school.”

According to Leonard,
Thornburgh attacked Wofford
personally, while Wofford
emphasized Thornburgh’s
dubious record.

“Thornburgh [wrongly]
attacked Wofford on  being a
liberal college president that ran
up huge deficits, and he slung

mud on a personal basis.“

Wofford pointed out what was
wrong with [Thornburgh’sl record
—I call that telling the truth,” he
said.

Students for Life President
Melissa Collins disagreed.
“Thornbu rgh didn’t need to mud-
sling. He already had his record
to support him.” But she said
Thornburgh might have
downplayed his assets. I-le “could
have played upon the fact that
he’s been with Pennsylvania
longer than anyone else has,” she
said.

“He’s been a public servant of
the state,-and Wofford hasn’t.”
She also characterized Wofford
as a “pro-abortion, extreme

CONTRACEPTIVE NEWS...FOR WOMEN ONLY!

Q  My girlfriend and I have been talking about

birth control options. All the answers are

& complicated and confusing. What do you
suggest that is SIMPLE?

A

A. Just remember these three simple letters V...C...F...
and your question is answered. It doesn’t stand for
Very C_onfusing Eacts, but rather Vaginal
Contraceptive Film. VCF” is probably the simplest
fonn of birth control that you can buy today without '
a prescription or an owners manual of directions.

Thousands of gynecologists across America have been recommending VCF-
Contraceptive Film to their patients. VCF Film comes in the form of a 2" _
Semitransparent square that is extremely soft. Most women say they can't
even feel VCF after it's inserted. VCF is one of the easiest forms of birth
control that you can buy tod_ay.‘All you have to do~is simply fold VCF over
and insert it like a tampon. VCF begins to dissolve in a matter of seconds.
No need to worry" about removing VCF. because there is nothing to '
remove. VCF simply washes away naturally. Each square of VCF contains
an effective amount of non-oxynol 9, the leading spermicide recommended
by doctors. SOUNDS LIKE A WINNER!

Look for VCF‘ CONTRACEPTIVE FILM at all THRIFT‘ DRUG stores.

Continued from page 1

Political Science Professor Irwin
Schulman, who proposed the
resolution on Oct. 1, said it is
necessary to limit fringe beneﬁts
enjoyed by university
administration.

“Unless we do something about
this now, it will go on forever,"
Schulman said.

The proposal to form an ad hoc
committee to investigate relations
between the faculty and the Board
of Trustees was made by Vice
President of University Senate
Oxanna Kaufman.

The assembly decided
unanimously to form the
committee. '

A similar report is being
conducted by Assistant Professor
of Administration and Policy
David A. Jones, but according to
University Senate President
Richard C. Tobias a preliminary
report due last month has not yet

' been received.

In. other business, University
Senate Committee on I lealth and
Welfare co—Chairperson' I Ierbert
Chesler proposed an increase in
health-insurance coverage for
university officials.

The increase would raise the
maximum on the Traditional and
University Health Network
policies from $250,000 to
$500,000.

Maximum coverage for the Blue
Cross/Blue Shield policy would
increase from $1,000,000 to
$2,000,000 under the proposal.

.Chesler also proposed that
faculty members and librarians
should be ,able to receive their
regular salary for absence due to

which it is now.

This was also passed

Concerning the purchases for
the Trees Hall weight-room
equipment, member Gil Golden
announced the SGB may not
have to pay for the equipment.

Golden said he held a meeting
with the groups who use the
room, and they have come up
with a way to purchase the
“perfect system" at cost.

The groups involved in the
meeting were the Pitt
Ambassadors, SGB, the
intramural department and the
School of Education.

Golden said that if the SGB‘

and the other groups involved
help Bedway Productions
promote an upcoming event,
the weight-room fund will get
10 percent of ticket sales and 20

percent of the money from
- corporate sponsors. —

“I walked away from the
meeting really happy. The SGB
will probably not have to pay a
cent from the reserve fund. This
equipment will double the
capacity of the weight room
and should be in place by the
spring or early summer,” Golden
said.

The President’s Council has been

“extremely productive," according to
Golden.

Another point Golden emphasized was
that SGB meetings are open to all students.
“Each week we have new business,
where students can voice their
complaints, concerns, comments and ask
questions,” he said.

The president, as well as other board
members, should be available to listen to
student concerns, according to Golden.
“Lately there has been an increase in

continue,” he said.

but I can listen to students and student
groups to become aware of problems
and work towards solving them,” Golden
said.

The Administrative Fomm will continue

_ monthly this term and during the spring

term.

“The forum went very well. Questions
were asked for two hours, and students
stayed after to discuss further questions
and concerns. Whether five people or
2,000 people are concerned, that's fine,”
he said.

Golden was asked his feelings on
reinstating the Campus Police Blotter.
“Students need to know what crimes are
happening and when, and how to protect

themselves,” he said.

The biggest problem was the listing of
the students’ names on the reports,
according to Golden. “This was a big
issue. If it could be returned without the
names, it would be good,” he said.

The public—safety committee and the
campus police are trying to help students
become aware of how to protect
themselves, according to Golden.

Some other goals of Golden included:
having the Academic Affairs Committee
finish the improvements in the course
evaluations, extending Crirrie Stop to off-
campus locations, reworking the shuttle,
taxi and bus service to be more efficient
and provide service for the most amount
of students possible, initiating progress

for a North Oakland computer lab and
helping fellow board members pursue
their goals and projects, so that there are
not problems similar to those in earlier
years.

This meeting was an extension of
running a successful campaign, according
to Golden. A

“l was really glad Theresa [Wilson], the
elections—committee chairperson,
suggested this. I wanted the opportunity
to meet as many students as possible and

to let them know who I am and what I -

represent,” Golden said.

Golden said he encourages student
voting. ‘‘It is really important for students
to come out and vote. We are elected to
represent the students,” he said.

Selling chunks

Some people will stop at nothing to make a fast buck.

Beaver Valley Demolition, the destruction company
hired to tear down the walls ()f the cherished Syria
Mosque, has been selling chunks of the building. Project
supervisor Rich I)iCiccio told ’lhe Pitt News, “We’re trying
to save what we can so people can have a remembrance
of the Syria Mosque.”

Prices started at five dollars and increased in cost
depending on size and detail. .\’eighborhood residents
and contractors have purchased the pieces,'and even the
Pittsburgh Athletic Association couldn’t resist buying into
its former neighbor. . ,

Slabs of marble from the inside of the building have

’ been sold for $150. _
l)i('Iiccio is claiming his intentions are simply pure. Since

there had been repeated claims to “Save the Mosque,” he
decided selling the pieces would at least give people the
opportun.ity to cherish the mosque and save a piece of
history. S

Profits have been “put in a pot,” according to yesterday’s
I-’ittsl)m;g/9 I-’ress. The money will be used to purchase
meals for the laborers during demolition hours.

Although thefe has been much support for the sale of
the building’s remnants, it is disturbing that Beaver Valley
Demolition has taken it upon itselfto decide the value of
the concrete that was once the Syria Mosque.

Hypocritical votes

The liypocritical vote taken by-the faculty assembly
yesterday concerning House Bill 1075 should have been
expected. 1 ‘ I

Although in the recent past the assembly had advoc.ated
Pitt President]. Dennis O’(Ionnor’s “new era ofopenness,”
it seems to believe that its salaries should be exempt from
publicatiqn. I

When the proposal was made by political—science
Professor Irwin Schulman to support the bill, it is not
surprising that the opposition came from a member ofthe
bit>logical-sciences department.

Frederick (‘tottlieb claimed the (Iowell Bill and the
information it would force the university to release would
be “too much.”

It is not ironic. that Gottlieb works for one facet of the
ljniversity of Pittsburgh which receives disproportionate
funding from the state.

There was much debate on the issue, however, and the
overwhelming vote did not deter some advocates. Philip
Wion, an linglish professor, though disappointed with the
results of the vote, said he still has faith that the Bill will
pass though the state legislature.

’l'he I-‘aculty Assembly, whose intention is to fight in the
crusade for the rights of itself and its colleagues, must
reali/.e that without the exact figures of budgetary and
administrative salaries, this university will continue to be
ruled by a bureaucracy that does not care about the
university community and its needs.

Genders hattle or/erpai

'I‘oday’s subject: Pain. I)on’t
worry, though. lt’s notlike I’m
going to complain about the time
I broke my hand running up
some stairs in Benedum Ilall.. I
just want to open a-few windows,
let some air in.

One time I was arguing with a
woman about pain. I had brought
up the subject by way of an
article I’d read about Lyndon
Johnson. It seems that during his
1948 campaign forthe U.S. Senate,
he flew all around‘ Texas in a
helicopter and, for a few days,
did so while passing a gallstone.
I told this woman that this was
remarkable because doctors —
people who lenowthis sort of thing
— have gauged passing a
gallstone as one of the most acute
pains a human being can
withstand.

She said something along the
lines of, “Ilaving a baby is more
painful,” and I disagreed. I pointed
out that these doctors. said
differently and, besides, women
are built to have children. It’s in
their physical makeup. Otherwise
the human race wouldn’t be
crashing big oil tankers all over
the place. A gallstone, I smugly
noted, has nasty sharp edges,
and it takes a couple of days to
pass through the urethra — a
tube built to carry liquid waste
out of the body.

She stuck to her guns, saying
that having a baby was the most
painful thing that can happen to
anybody. She was a hardcore.
feminist, so I didn’t press the
issue. There are some things you
just can’t argue with some people.

But I got to thinking what this
meant. This woman’s argument,
underneath her objections to
gallstone pain, was that the most
extreme pain a human being

Chris
g Winters

could feel was the exclusive
providence of women. Never
mind all those awful things I'm
sure you’re thinking right now,
things that you think are more
painful than having a baby. This
pain was it. She claimed this thing,
this pain, as woman’s.

But the oddest thing about the -

whole incident is whatwas being
claimed. Extreme pain is
something ‘ normally associated
with men in the mass
consciousness because men are
the only ones who “dare” enough
to achieve -such pain, the only
ones stupid enough to believe
they can hold a lighter under
their hand without feeling a thing.
But think about that relation: To
feel such massive pain you must
do something extraordinary to
earn that pain. Pain is related to
suffering,_ and out ofsuffering, as
all us good Americans know,
come good people, as well as
good artists. Therefore good
people suffer real pain, and it’s a
given that artists must suffer real
pain to make real art. Does this
mean that bad people h_aven’t
suffered enough?

All that leads me to this: Why
are some people so vehemently
against women in combat? If
they’re so certain that “Women
can’t handle it,” then they should
probably meet some of those
who serve —‘ the women who go
through the same training as men
but who aren’t allowed to be on
the. front lines. 15 something else
beneath there? Maybe the
opposite of the previously

n analsaering

mentioned woman’s view? That
ifwomen were equal with men in
combat, they’d be equal with
men in “glories” received after
combat? That women would be
as decorated as men? A horrible
fear that women could possibly
do better than men in combat?
That if women “proved

-themselves,” some exclusive
aspect of their “maleness” would _

be lost, just as this particular
woman perceived great pain to
be “female?” ‘

Unfortunately, I just don’t
know. I can’t say what people are
thinking, but I can point out weird
stuff. Does this sort of thinking
get anyone anywhere? It seems
to me thatonce one gender stakes
out a claim, on something like
pain, which both genders can
easily understand, and turns it
into something only theycan feel,
the other gender will see this as
an attack on theirgender and react
accordingly.

And it doesn’t matter what the
real issue is, a person from one
group calls another a name like
“misogynist” or “hairy-legged
feminist,” and people just get
angrier and angrier until it
escalates into some all—out,
nuclear hate—fest, and nothing is
resolved.

Then a month or so later, the
whole deal winds up on Oprah!
and the representative studio
audience helps the guests solve
the problem in halfan hour while
later that night Ted Koppel
interviews a representative panel
of experts (What? George F. Will
again?), and they, too, solve the
problem in half an hour. Pretty
neat, eh?

Chris Winters is a senior
majoring in history.

  Exhibition offers young Panthers first challenge

ll,

Rowing Club
By Bob Maselli 1
Staff W/riler

The University of Pittsburgh Rowing
Club finished its varsity fall schedule after
traveling to Occoquan, Va., to compete in
the “Head of Occoquan” regatta this past
weekend, and didn’t fare as well as in the
past three regattas. The competition was
tough, with a ﬁeld of over 20 “pro” clubs
and schools. Pitt came‘ home with a
scattering of different finishes.

The club will now take a few months off
from the river to concentrate on
conditioning for sprint races, starting in
the middle of next semester.

The men’s novice eight team, made up
of Scott Wallace, Ron Schmoll, Brad
Gammons, Steve Alves, Andy Paladino,
Robert~Allen, Shawn Ellis, Stu Wachs and
coxswain Karen Rearick took a sixth-
place finish in the 3.1—mile course, with a
time of 17 minutes, 41 seconds.

The races were extremely tight, and the
Pitt club was lessthan a minute away from

Pitt basketball enters into the
realm ofthe unknown tonight, as
head coach Paul Evans unveils
his squad to the public in an
exhibition against a touring
Canadian National Team.

Trouble is, some fans might
not recogni’/.e the Pitt team in its
current form.

lior the past few weeks in
practice, the Panthers have been
running, pressing and generally
making their game into the 94-
foot variety. Seemingly less
important is Iivans’ traditional
pound—it—out style, which has
been modified to make room for
the number of athletes on this
year’s team.

Some things, however, stay the
same. Sean Miller will be running
the show once again, and he will
belexpected to provide more
points as well as leadership. And
Iivans hasn’t junked his inside-
power game completely.

Rather, without the presence
of a knowledgeable and veteran
post player like Brian Shorter,
livans has transferred some of
the offensive load off the
frontcourt.

There is some offensive ability
in the backcourt after Miller.
-Sophomores Ahmad Shareef,
Gandhi Jordan and Tim Glover
have all seen'action, and each

_ bring a different dimension.

I*irst—ycar player Jerry
McCullough has also looked
impressive in workouts, although
he will be understudying to Miller
for now.

However the Panthers don't

seem to have the consistent long-

range shooting threat in the
starting lineup yet, the kind of
player who can take even mor.e
pressure off a young frontline.
What the team does have up
front is some size and depth.
Both have been missing the last
few yea rs. But now Evans has the
luxury of dividing minutes

between some talented big men.
Junior forward Chris McNeal
provided scoring and boa rdwork
last season but did not start a
game.

The only returning players who
have starting experience are
Darren Morningstar and Antoine
Jones, but Jones will be out of
uniform for at least another month
with an ankle injury.

The unknown factors are the
play of sophomore transfer line
Mobley, Pitt’s first true center in a
long time, and first-year forwards
Chris Bennett and Orlando
Antigua. I

All three have seen substantial
practice time and should figure
into the rotation.

Chances are that livans will
show a lot of different things
tonight, including a full—court
press that utilizes the size of
Morningstar and the athleticism
of Shareef, Antigua and
McCullough.

Last year Pitt came out in its
exhibitions and displayed a
quicker team than in past years.
The situation could be quite the
same tonight at l"it'/.gerald Pield
I-louse.

This will be the inaugural game
for the Canadians in their Big Iiast
swing. After Pittsburgh, they will
travel to all the conference schools
with the exception of Miami and
wind up the tour at Syracuse on
Nov. 19.

Their roster features three
players who played at American
schools: I)avid’l'urcotte, a 6—foot,
3-inch guard from Colorado State;
6-4 Richard Stewart from St.
Joseph’s University in
Philadelphia, Pa., and 7-1 Jim
Zoet, who attended Kent State
University.

The rest of the players played
at Canadian colleges, including
four from the U niversity of Victoria
and two from Simon Fraser
University.

The 12-man team consists of
four guards, five forwards and
three centers.

finishes fall season with ‘decent showing’

the first-place team. State University of
New York-Maritime took first-place honors
in the men’s novice race, with a time of
16/5, and George Mason grabbed a
second. Forbes Avenue rival Carnegie
Mellon finished in eighth place in the
event. In the men’s novice four race, Pitt
finished in a disappointing 12th place.

In the women’s novice eight race, Pitt
took another sixth—p1ace finish with a time
of 20:35, only 32 seconds behind the first-
place club, Richmond University. CM
finished in fifth place with a time of 20:31.
The Pitt club is made up of Lorin Gaylord,
Melissa 1'-‘uller, .\'ancy 7.ebo,Jennifer Buck,
April Gearhart, Chris Gerhardt, Melinda
Mylet, Michelle Zielinski and Coxswain
George Collins.

In the women’s novice four race, Pitt
brought home a seventh-place ﬁnish. That
event was won by Capitol Rowing Club
boat A, and second place went to Capito
Rowing Club boat B. A

In the men’s varsity eight race, Pitt.

placed sixth, behind George Mason,

  

Potomac State, SUNY—Maritime, St. John's
and Bucknell. The Pitt team, made" up of
lightweight and heavyweight members,
includes Matt Prechtel, Peter Alpern, John
Dougherty,John livers, Bob lialk, Graham
Turnbull, Bert Losken, Mike Kuchera and
Collins at coxswain.

For Pitt, the bright spot in the race was
the beating ofi\/Iercyhurst College. Pitt lost
to Mercyhu rst at the Speakmon Regatta in
Ohio two weekends ago but got its revenge
in this regatta. In the men’s varsity four
race, Pitt’s heavyweight team finished in

K 10th place, while the lightweight team

finished in eighth.

The women’s varsity eight team from
Pitt did not fare much better than the rest
of the club, as it finished in 10th place
behind the first-place Baltimore Rowing
Club.

The varsity eight team is made up of

Jenifer Whitaker, Marcy McCurdy, Lori

Shofran, Leslie Bu rchett, Andrea
Zicherman, Amy Meier, Missy Miller and
Dana Jaros. The women’s championship

four lightweight team finished in ninth
place, and the heavywieght team finished
14th.

“We are pretty happy with what we did
this weekend even though it doesn’t look
all thatgood on paper,” said club President
Graham Turnbull. “The course was full of
some tricky turns, and it was very winding.
This made it tough on our coxswains, but
we ended our varsity season with a decent

‘ showing.

“The really important races are set for
next semester, when we will compete in
sprint races against college teams more
than c1ubs,” Turnbull added. “We have
our winter training cut out for us. We will
do a lot of running, lifting, and we’ll play
soccer to reduce the monotony.”

The next regatta for the Pitt club will be
a novice-only event in the CARDUPIT in
Pittsburgh against CM and Duquesne on
Saturday, Nov. 16. All are welcome to
attend the event, which will take place
right here in Pittsburgh on the Allegheny
River at Washington Landing.

Before this football season
began, not much was expected
from the Pitt Panthers.

They were coming off a 3-7-1
season. liight of this year’s
projected starters were not on
this season’s roster. Pitt head
coach Paul llackett said, “This is
a young team that has less talent
than last year’s squad, but they

awe’

are more focused and they play
better as a team.”

Hackett stressed the importance
of senior leadership. “lfthis team
is going to improve on last year,
the seniors are going to have to
step forward and take charge,”
he said. “These are the guys that
have been around for four and
five years, and they know what it
takes.”

needed to win their season-
opening game against West
Virginia in order to avoid going to
a bowl named after outdoor, land-
maintenance equipment.

After Pitt demolished the
Mountaineers in front of 63,000
screaming WVU fans and millions
watching nationally on ESPN, the
tone began to change. Many
thought the Panthers would be
all right.

Then Pitt rolled to two decisive
victories over Southern Mississippi
and Temple; the talk of a
postseason contest was upgraded
to minor—bowl status, like one
named after a semiprecious metal
or a signer of the Declaration of
Independence.

Hackett praised the seniors for
stepping up and accepting the
challenge. He also lauded several
young recruits, like receiver
Dietrich Jells and running back
Curtis Martin, for rising to the
occasion.

“Players like Dietrich and Curtis
realize that when the opportunity
to play arises, they have to seize

' it and make the most out of it,”

Hackett said. “These two have
come in and really done an
outstanding job.” ,

Pitt then struggled to two tough
victories: a one—point decision
over Minnesota and a four—point
thriller against Maryland. The
defense had to rescue a struggling
offense which seemingly could
no longer put points on the board

when it had to.

Until the Minnesota game, when
the Panthers got the ball inside
the “red zone” (the opposing
team's 20-yard line), they did not
fail to convert all year. Against the
Golden Gophers, they missed
capitalizing on scoring
opportunities eight times.

The Panthers mustered their
points against the Gophers on a
36-yard run by Martin and a
blocked punt they returned for a
touchdown.

Against Maryland it was much
the same story. Pitt would drive
the ball on the Terrapins until it
got to the Maryland 35 and then
become gun-shy, missing several
easy scoring opportunities.

Pitt would have paid dearly for
those inefficiencies if not for a
jarring hit by free safety Lex
Perkins and an interception by
strong safety Doug W haley, which
thwarted a last-minute Maryland
drive.

So after starting the year 5-0,
the Panthers rolled into South
Bend, Ind; The talk was if the
Panthers could beat the Irish on

the road, then they could be
smelling Georgia peaches come
New Year’s Day or at least be
playing with Florida swamp
animals.

However the Panthers never
got started against Notre Dame.
After a scoreless first quarter, the
Irish exploded.

Pitt was dominated in every
facet of the game. They were
outplayed on offense, defense
andﬂspecial teams. Still, most
thought that with a little luck, the
bowl chances remained about
the same.

Against Syracuse, Pitt still
looked shellshocked. Even
though Syracuse committed a
ridiculous number of turnovers
(six), the Panthers were not able
to put the game away. The
defense, the mainstay of the team,
was unable to hold a 10-point,
fourth-quarter lead.

The Orangemen drove down
the field on their final drive to
take the lead with nine seconds
to play.

The following contest‘ against
East Carolina was much the same

story. Pitt could not score when it
had to, and the defense cou_ld not
stop quarterback Jeff Blake. The
Pirates escaped with a one—point
victory.

So the Panthers entered last
week’s game against Boston
College with a 5-3 record, needing
a win to break a three—game
losing streak and to salvage a
chance to possibly return to El
Paso, Texas, in the postseason.

It was not to be. “We played as
flat as a pancake,” Hackett said.

The leading ﬂapjack in that
one was quarterback Alex Van
Pelt. Boston College did
something that nobody else has
done this year:

. They pressured Van Pelt the
entire game. Even after fourtimes,
Van Pelt could not find an open
receiver when BC came with the
cornerback blitz. He was picked
off three times, many of those
coming after he was hit while
throwing.

“What happened against
Boston College was not
characteristic of this team,”
I-lackett said. “We just were not

playing well on defense, offense

or special teams. I mean Jim 9

Royal goes three years or

whatever and never snapped the 1
ball over the punter’s head and’
snaps one eight feet over Leon".

[Theodorou’s] head when he’s

backed up i_n the end zone. T hat‘ ’

just does not always happen. I
could make a lot of money if I
could avoid having a team come
out and play like we did against

Boston College. Up until the BC "

game, I though we had played
pretty good football for the entire
year. I thought we were a pretty
good football team. I think that
after last Saturday, we took a‘ step
back.” V

So now the only holiday that
the Panthers will play on is
Thanksgiving Day, and it’s not
going to be in a warm climate but
right here in Pittsburgh against
Penn State.

“Maybe we quit taking the
