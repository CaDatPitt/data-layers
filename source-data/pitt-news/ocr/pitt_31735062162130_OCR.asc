W°”er90leMl“°’E'9Cll°” Flaherty Enters Senate Race

Problem, Republicans Say  

BY ED HOLLIN
President Nixon’s Watergate-
related problems will be a minor
factor in local elections this
November, according to leading

.Allegheny County Republicans.

“I think it [Watergate] could have
a minor effect on Congressional
candidates, but I think it will have

‘no effect on the outcome of

0‘:

C‘!-

Congressional races,” said Al-
legheny County Republican chair-
man Robert Fohl.

“There are some intangible
detriments," he added. “Our
party workers are more dispirited
now than they were a year ago.
This will be a residual effect. Right

now the overall spirit is lower than '

it should be, but lower than it will
be in November.”

GOP Congressman H.
Heinz’s press secretary,
Martz, claimed Heinz suffered no
such problem.

“The Heinz organization is still
there,” Martz said. “We’ve had
no trouble in stimulating volun-
teers.”

Martz said Heinz is identiﬁed by

Gallup Poll Says
GOP'S Strength

Lowest Since '36

PRINCETON, N..I. AP--The
latest Gallup poll shows Republican
strength for the upcoming con-
gressional elections is at its lowest
level in the 38 years that Gallup has
been taking such surveys.

A total of 3,183 registered voters
were asked in two national surveys
in January which party they would
rather see win the congressional
election in their home districts.

The Democratic party enjoys a
2-1 lead. 58 per cent to 29 per cent,
with 13 per cent undecided. Gallup
said the ﬁgures would indicate the
GOP would suffer a loss far greater
than the average of 29 seats lost by
the President's party in off-year
elections in this country.

The pollsters said the national
nature of the survey makes it
impossible to determine how many
House seats each party might
occupy after the next election. But
they said the margin could be wider
than the 295 to 140 majority the
Democrats held after the landslide
victory of Lyndon B. Johnson in
1964.

The Gallup organization pointed
out that previous surveys have
shown that the Republican share of
the vote increases as voter turnout

off-year elections.‘

voters as an independent who has
on occasion differed with the
President.

Fohl commented on the race in
Michigan for Vice-President Gerald
Ford's'old seat. There, helped by a
poor Republican turnout, Democrat

Richard VanderVeen won by.

campaign as a
referendum on Nixon’s record,
according to observers. Vander-
Veen was the ﬁrst Democrat since
‘I910 to win that seat.

The County GOP chairman
thought a similar strategy would be
ineffective here. If a Democratic
challenger, would try that tactic,
Fohl said, “I would concentrate on
the incumbent’s record and not
issues which are relatively. irrel-
evant.”

Martz saidlthe Heinz forces would
ﬁght that issue by “getting people
to come to the polls” as was not
done in Michigan.

State Senator Robert Fleming

running his

(R-Allegheny) acknowledged-

knowing little about the.Michigan
race, but said of a referendum on
the President in the form of a local
election, “I don’t think that's
possible in Pennsylvania. The
people who believe in the Republi-
can party and its policy will stay
with it.”

Fohl agreed. “On state races, I
find it hard to believe it
[Watergate] would change people’s
minds.”

“On the state level, Idon’t think it
will be a factor,” Fleming said.

Asked his feelings about effects of
the President's current unpop-
ularity on local races, state
Representative Richard J. Frank-
enburg (R-Allegheny) said, “None
at all. It (the election) is so far
away and things change so fast I
wouldn’t want to wager a guess.”

BY MATT KAMBIC
Pittsburgh Mayor Peter Flaherty

has entered the race for a
Pennsylvania seat in the US
Senate. Speaking at a Chatham

Center news conference on Wed-
nesday, the Mayor outlined the
reasons behind his candidacy.

“The roots of our problems are
in Washington, not in Harris-
burg,-” Flaherty said, in explaining
his choice between the Senate and
the governorship.

“There has been a total
leadership failure in Washington,
and the people recently rated
Congress even lower than the
President, which is hard to
behevef‘

Flaherty said his record was
clear. “I reduced the cost of
government; cut taxes, increased
government services, and reduced
the crime rate. These are the
things we need in Washington,” he
said, “and I think we need them
now.” ‘ '

The Senate seat Flaherty hopes
to win is currently held by
Republican Richard Schweiker,
who recently was endorsed by the
state_ AFL-CIO and labor in
general. “I don’t believe,” said
Flaherty in ‘ assessing Schweiker’s
support, “that labor bosses control
the rank-and-file working man.”

State Insurance Commissioner
Herbert S. Denenberg is expected

to oppose Flaherty in the Demo-

cratic primaries. Both Dennenburg
and Schweiker could provide stiff
opposition to Mayor Flaherty’s
voter popularity.

“Any individual can decide if he
wants to run for public ofﬁce," said
Denenberg. “But the people have
to determine who will serve.”

Denenberg will formally announce‘
Monday his candidacy for the
Democratic senatorial nomination,

Rhodes Urges BAS

BY RITA VITOL0

Representative Joe Rhodes of
the state's 14th Congressional
District met with black student
leaders last night to explore ways
of involving Pitt’s Black Action
Society (BAS) in the legislative
process.

“What the Statehouse needs is a
healthy injection of reasonableness
in the black leadership. There are
some very serious problems in the
state that black students could help
with, and what I’d like to see
develop is a symbiotic relationship
between my office and the black
students at Pitt,” Rhodes said.

Rhodes sought student support
for his House Bill 1519, which
abolishes money bail. Introduced

, .¢.

in the legislature ﬁve months ago,
the bill releases those charged with
an offense either on their own
recognizance or into the custody of
a guardian. Rhodes.is currently
revising’ the bill to include a
provision dealing with detainers.

“Remember, the origins of this
bill are very important--it origi-
nated out of the Black Action
Caucus’s prison investigation last
summer. It’s not coming out of any
do-good notions on penal reform;
this bill has the support of wardens
and people involved on a day-,to--
day basis with the prisonefs,”
stressed Rhodes.

“But+-l almost don’t have hi slay
it--with a bill of this sort {the
criticism is going to be massive.

Pennsylvania commuters may be
spared an increase in car insurance
rates despite the prediction by an
industry study group that inﬂation
would cause such a hike.

According to Tony Aielio of

Underwriters Research, Penn-
sylvania insurance companies
would have a difﬁcult time getting
rate increases through the In-

Activism

“There is no way to know who’s
a bad risk. What it comes down to
is comparatively a subjective
choice. You get a judge and he
says, ‘I can tell by the look on his
face that guy's a criminal,’ and I.
say ‘Howucan you tell? Who can
tell?’

“And when black students

experience,--when you get out and
see what your brothers are going

five years, and they couldn’t get an

He said insurance rates may ’
instead decrease for people in car *
pools because of all around less
driving due to gasoline shortages.

“The rates are deﬁnitely coming
down,” said a spokesman for
Allstate Insurance Company. He
cited fewer cars on the roads, less
miles driven and fewer accidents as
reasons for the decrease, which
should affect car-poolers in that
company by the end of the year.

Michael Anderson of the Erie
Insurance Company says the
energy crisis has prompted more
calls regarding his company’s
discount for car pools. “If they are
in a car pool, we have no objection
to their dropping to a lower risk
category.”

Regarding any inﬂation caused
rate increases, Anderson said,
“Insurance companies are always
slow to make a change.”

some of last year’s SGAC mem-
bers.

The new SGAC members are:
Bill Barker, Patty Cooper, Chuck
Diederich, Bob Heister, Maureen
Maloney, Pat Nixon, Jack Rom-
berg, and Phillip Rosenthal.

The screening committee had
recommended Tom Smith for the
SGAC, but Smith withdrew and
was replaced by Nixon.

The Board approved new SGAC
guidelines, also by a unanimous
vote. The guidelines clarify what
the SGB will and will not fund, and
make attendance at an SGB
meeting mandatory for groups
under consideration for allocations.

In other business, the Board
voted 3-2 to deny recognition to the
Fellowship of Christian Athletes
[FCA]. Most Board members ‘could
see no distinction between the FCA
and the Campus Crusade for Christ

Relation Commission. The Com-
mission would be forbidden to
become involved in a case where
collective action had already taken
place, thus limiting the “patterns
and practices” of discrimination
suits that were responsible for the
early major strides in human
rights legislation.

“What we're asking for is
handwritten notes or petitions to be
sent to the governor asking him to
veto any bill like SB 1306, and
asking him to hold to his pledge to
veto any measure that would
restrict the human relations com-

our faith within our common bond
as athletes.”

Blandino said there are “about
20” active FCA members.

assumption that the fully oriented
student will serve as a more
knowledgeable guide. The pro-

“Arthur S. Boughey in Biology 138
7 this term. We feel the book, beside
, being scientifically inaccurate in
‘ 3 many places, is explicitly racist and
 in fact advocates a “solution” to
the-"problems of mankind not unlike
1 the one Hitler proposed in Mein
H ’ Kampf. That such a book is used in
I a large biology class as the main
1 text is very serious indeed, and
I, should be cause for a public
;;investigation by appropriate com-
I mittees and individuals.
V At this time (because of lack of
space) only a few examples can be
given illustrating the racism in the
.. text. A fuller analysis will be
_prepared shortly. The book is an
‘introduction to human ecology;
with chapters on human evolution,
population growth and control,
‘water and air pollution and ending
V with a chapter on the future for the
, human race. On page 253,
Boughey discusses ethnic differ-
~ cnces in birth rate.

  it Vietnam

Dear Sir,

The Feb. 1 article concerning the
continuing war in Vietnam by Larry
_ Pansino dealt well with the
I " ‘ problems Americans must face as
our tax dollars are still used after
} Pres. Nixon's so called “peace with

honor" solution in Vietnam, to
perpeturate illegal imprisonment of
civilians, continued bombings of
villages with US planes, bombs and
fuel, and other serious violations of
the Agreement to End the War.

However, there are two rather
' serious errors of fact, both of which
were written by the reporter. The
fabric of American society was torn
by the war, not the anti war
movement. The only way to stop
American resistance to the war,
and quiet the internal disruptions
to families and society was to
terminate the war. Therefore the
US signed the Agreement, even
though it may have had no
intention to seriously implement it.

In the only paragraph which is
not ascribed to me, and therefore
can only be ascribed to the
reporter, it is stated that the North
have built up troop levels to

listed are, “Use of Fertility Control
Agent on a Regional Basis.”
Under this subtopic Boughey states
that,

It is believed that a considerable
range of suitable substances will be
available in from 5 to 15 years as a
result of present research. Such a
chemosterilant substance could
readily be introduced to the water
supply of urban areas, where often
it is especially needed. A parallel
suggestion is the addition of similar
temporary sterilants to staple foods
such as‘ bread or sugar, which
might be more practical altema-
tives in some instances, [p. 300].

Among other procedures listed
are “Issuing Children Licenses (p.
300), “Compulsory Sterilization of
Men Having Three or More Living
Children.” (P. 300), “Withdrawal
of Maternity Benefits After the
Birth of a Given Number of
Children" (p. 302) and “Insistence
on Population Control prior to
Delivery of Famine -Relief Sup-
plies.” (p. 304) In the last chapter
entitled “The Future" Boughey
lists_ ten “rights to be conceded" if
we are to save the human race from
ecological catastrophe. Among the
ten listed are (1) “The right to have
as many children as we wish," (2)
“The right to have any children at
all with particular genotypes," (4)
“The right to externalize our labor
problems by strikes which dislocate
societal facilities," (5) “The right
to reside in any locality of our own
choice in the United-States." (p.
433). Later, Boughey discusses the
need for a eugenics program and
the probable development of a new
superior species of humans--
“Homo lnovatus" (p. 219).

The first quote mentioned (p.
254) involves the use of a racist
stereotype of ghetto women,
implying that the only pleasure

to the

basis on which to suggest any
ﬁgure and am not certain if there
are any soldiers from the North at
this moment in the South, or if so,
how many. In any case, the
military posture of the’ PRG in the
South at this time is to officially
defend their territory against the
“land grabbing" operations of the
ARVN. The Liberation Armed
Forces are under orders to take
back any land which at the time of
the Agreement (Jan 27) was theirs
and has since been taken from
them. This is defensive warfare.
Mme Nguyen thi Binh, Foreign
Minister of the PRG, in an
extensive interview stated, “We
shall not sit on folded hands while
Saigon takes our land_ and kills_ our
people." “We shall not start a new
war, we are interested in imple-
menting the terms of the Agree-
ment to End the War and find a
political solution to the war."

Grandeur?

Dear Editor,

Being an American in 1974, I
h-ave a comment to make--a
comment which may sound like an
epitaph on the tombstone of some
lost society.

The grandeur that once was ours
is gone.
surrounded us seems to have

The dignity that once.

they get in life is in getting
pregnant and that availability of
free clinics wouldn't solve the
“problem.” Such a statement
parallels closely the argument of
Edward Banﬁeld in the Unheavenly

City, a widely criticized racist book

(See W. Ryan's review. “ls
Banfield Serious?") Banfield
paints the same picture of
“lower-class blacks" as present-
oriented, dehumanized animals.

The numerous ghetto uprisings
and welfare protests have put the
lie to this stereotype of “lower-
class" behavior. As for the section
on population control measures, it
should be remembered that part of
the UN definition of genocide
involves forced birth control. The
later section on eugenics and the
development of a master race,
“Homo lnovatus" parallels so
closely Hitler's conception of an
Aryian race that for_ now, at least,
no further explanation is needed.

We feel that permitting the use
of such a textbook would be setting
a dangerous precedent. Such ideas
provided the ideological base for
the Nazi movement in Germany
and is presently being used to
justify such policies as the
proposed bill in Ohio, which would
sterilize welfare mothers with more
than 2 children, the case of forced
sterilization of 2 black women in
Alabama, performing psycho-sur-
gery (labotomies) on prisoners and
other “deviants" L and William
Schockley's proposalfor sterilizing
people with under a certain IQ. We
would appreciate that action be
taken in regards to this complaint

Elossﬁlliﬁlﬁtgg not Prohahilﬁtgg  

BY TOM SMITH
Last year the Undergraduate
Academic’Review (UAR) was
denied funding by Student Gov-
ernment (SG). V

At the time it was thought the
UAR evaluation system was
inefficient. The decile system used
by the Center for the Improvement
of Teaching, was considered too
complex to serve student needs.

The goal of SG became the
development of a new teaching
evaluation system designed to
provide students with adequate
course information.

One year later the academic
review does not exist. A new
format for evaluating courses has
not been developed. In essense,
the UAR is dead.

In September the Bulleting.

Committee was formed to consider
“the whole registration process"
under the chairmanship of Robert
D. Marshall, Dean, College of Arts
and Sciences.

The committee recommended the
“combination of the Time Table

. and Course Description Booklet in

one publication."

According to the report the “issue
of including evaluations of faculty
teaching in the same booklet was
raised but tabled pending devel-
opments in the teaching evaluation
systems.”

The Bulletin Committee did not
resolve this problem. No com-
mitment has been made by the
University to study the evaluation
system. In the meantime students
are being deprived of essential
registration information.

Since then Dean Marshall has_

suggested the formation of a
committee under Dr. Rhoten
Smith, Provost, with the function of

only nation that has never ex-
perienced hardship. It’s high time
we did.

And I'm sorry this may "seem
sad. Reading it through, I realize
that it is. I sincerely wish I was
seventy years old, or thereabouts,
because then this would be just a
typical lament of an old man in
despair, and we could take it all
lightly. The truth is I'm barely
twenty, and I'm supposed to inherit
this red, white, and blue garbage
can. I'm not sure I want it.

Sincerely,

developing an evaluation system
serving the needs of the students,
faculty, and administration.

Several students have already
expressed interest in reviving the
course review process. But, the
future of an academic evaluation
depends on the three groups,’ par-
ticularly students as represented
by their government.

First, the SG Board must commit
itself to the formation of another
academic review publication. It is
useless to study the evaluation
system if SG is unwilling to help
resolve the problem.

Since Student Government is most
reponsible for “scuttling” the
UAR, it must bear the respon-
sibility of reorganizing the group.

The UAR has no funds. Thus, SG
should publicize the rebirth of a
course -"evaluation publication.
Also, the government should
assume the task of advertising for
membership. ‘

Once the Board has committed
itself to this goal interested
students can commit themselves to
reestablishing this organization.

A formal committment by SG is
not something that can wait for two
or three weeks pending study. It
must be made immediately.

Secondly, along with those stu-
dents already committed to a new
academic review, Student Govern-

ment representatives should seek,
to establish a committee under the

Provost as suggested” by Dean
Marshall.

The committee should concern
itself with only one respect of the
registration process, course evalu-
ations.

The new committee must assume
the existing format as approved by
the Center for the Improvement of
Teaching is incapable of serving
the interests of the students,
faculty, and the administration.
Further debate of this point is
useless.

The ﬁrst priority of the committee
should be the development of a
new evaluation system. Once this
is accomplished questions of
funding, the schools involved,
insured faculty involvement and
other mechanical problems can be
resolved.

All factions of the University
community are entitled to repre-
sentation on V the committee.
Student Government should select
its representatives carefully and be
certain the directives of the Board

are being followed at all times.
However, for now it depends on

the seven members of the SGB. At
this time only they can accept the
challenges, responsibilities,
burdens of reviving an academic
review. And the University

community will be observing and
evalu_at_i_n_g their response.

FAS Council  Review Experiencin

A-B-C Grading Proposal

BY DAN DEELY

A ﬁnal test of A-B-C-no entry
grading, a proposal by a committee
from the psychology department, is
expected at the March meeting of
the Faculty of Arts and Sciences
(FAS).

An appeal of 40 faculty signa-
tures will be submitted at the
meeting which will insure a vote by
the entire FAS, unless the proposal
is not tabled.

The new grading system would
eliminate D and F grades when a
student performed below the C
level. However, for the sake of
completing required credit quotas‘
for graduation, students would
have the option of getting a D
grade. Possibly, W grades would
be eliminated but I and G grades
would not.

Last month the proposal failed to.
pass a vote by the College of Arts

' and Sciences (CAS) Council. Dean

Robert Marshall, chairman of the
Council, said, “The principal
source of confusion in the debate
was that we were not as a Council
actively deliberating the issue of a
grading system but passively doing
our legislative duty to a particular
proposal.

“The vote of the Council, then,”
Marshall explained, “represents
ranges in position from affirmation
of the present grading system to a
desire to have a far fuller range of
possibilities, after ‘a thorough
study, under consideration.

Marshall said opponents of the
proposal felt, “The system we have
now shows wins and losses in a
kind of balance sheet of academic
performance. _

“If the A-B-C-no entry system
was put into use students would get
grades for accomplishments only
and employers and graduate
schools wouldn’t have a complete
picture of a student’s past work
record.

PITTSBURGH AP--The whole-
sale price of milk in the Pittsburgh
area will go up at least five cents a
gallon Monday and the consumer
probablywill see the increase in
the price he pays.

At least two food chains say their
wholesale prices will be increased.
The price will be 60 cents to 90
cents depending on the supplier." A
60-cent increase averages out to
about 5‘/2 cents a gallon.

“I think there’ll be a strong
debate of the system at the FAS
meeting in_ March," i Marshall
added. '

In a statement on the proposed
grading system, Dean Elizabeth
Baranger, of the Graduate Council,
said, “The Graduate Council at its
meeting on January 17, 1974
agreed unanimously (5 faculty, 5
students were present) that it was
not convinced by the proposal
presented by the psychology
department that there is a need_ for
altering the grading system for
FAS nornthat the proposed system
is preferable to the existing one.”

The psychology department had
petitioned the FAS that graduate
courses use a grading system of
A/B-no entry with optional C
grades. » «

This is my benediction to the
YES concert--Thursday, Feb. 21,
1974...at the Civic Arena.

You'see, I never thought that I’d
live to see the day when the people
at the Arena would do something
right. Every concert there has
been a hassle for me--be it
acoustics or the silly idiots who
attend the shows, I’ve always left
with a tense feeling in my stomach.
The usual hoopie who run_s to the
stage after the lights go down has
been quite an attraction for the past
few years, especially since grass hit
the high school scene. And the
Pittsburgh law enforcement agen-
cies haven’t been the kindest
people to show goers.

But...this past concert was a
revelation to me and has truly
turned my head around about the
personnel and police.

Being a reporter‘ always has its

r ups and downs, but it has recently

been a series of mixups ahd let
downs. I’ve been receiving info
from a few promotional companies
including passes to concerts and
interviews with the performers’.
This past .concert was no exception.
‘Passes are kept at the press gate
and I pick them up before the
show...they were not there this
time and the show was about to
begin. After numerous messages
sent backstage and phone calls

the local promotional company.
His attitude was of no help since he
didn’t believe a word I said. I was
really stranded.

I was told that I'd have to wait
until the guy I said was my contact

A’ /vlennen-directed Psycho—drama

Psycho-drama, a study of the
interrelationship between the psy-
chiatric and dramatic processes,
has been used in the production of
the University of Pittsburgh Studio
Theatre’s upcoming presentation
of The Museum, whichwill open on
Friday, March 1, at 8:30 pm, in the
Studio Theatre, basement, Cathe-
dral of Learning.

Subsequent performances will be
held on March 2 and'3 and March 7
through 9. Admission is $1.

The Museum is an original play
by Dr. Guillermo Borrero, a
resident in psychiatry, at Western
Psychiatric Institute and. Clinic
(WPIC). The play is set in a small
Latin American town. In the style
oft e “theatre of the absurd," The
Mugeum provides a commentary
on’ the conditions in under-
developed countries. -

The production is the culmin-
ation - of several months of
rehearsals. during which time the
performers and the director inter-
acted, both with and without the
playscript. During these group
sessions, the director of the
play—-Dr. Richard Mennen, assis-
tant professor of theatre arts--and
the actors, mostly Pitt students,
were observed by a team of

_ psychiatrists.

The psychiatrists studied and
commented on the group res-
ponses, in an attempt to encourage

the participants to effectively
channel their energies to enhance
the dramatic and artistic result of
the play.

Dr. Borrero and Dr. Raymond
Naar, adjunct associate professor
of educational psychology at Pitt,
served as co-leaders in the group

interaction sessions.

Dr. Borrero previously directed
an Argentine play in 1969 and two

Review of “Busting”;

BY M.C. PILECKI

Hoo boy, another police movie.

Of all the film genres inundating
the silver screen lately, the most
overworked has certainly got to be
thepolice movie. The tale of the
good guys in blue ﬁghting the bad
guys, of crime, liberals, courts,
pay-offs, etc. is worn right into the
ground any more. _,

Such crime yarns have always
been popular, but this current
spate is most recentlytraceable to
Steve McQueen’s Bullitt, exciting
if not overly deep, which brought
what is still one of the best chase
scenes to the screen. The films
that ‘have repeated .Bullitt even
down to the hilly chase scenes, are
too numerable to mention and
usually too routine to remember.

Details of the police ﬂicks may
vary slightly, but they always
concern the dedicated cop stymied
as much by the political pow-
ers-that-be as by the crooks (who
by comparison are usually pretty
cool). The only change has been
increasing use of violence by an
almost exclusively male cast, with
the females just used as pawns in
criminal or casual sex (ah/, for the
provocative bedroom scenes of
Jacqueline Bisset). A

So, despite boasts from such
heralded and/or hated ﬂicks as The
French Connection, the Clint
Eastwood epics, and some of the
more forgettable ones, Bullitt has
remainedking of the mountain for
police dramatic ﬂction. The
distinction of dramatic fiction is to
exclude films
Robbers and Serpico, the former a
satiric look at the police situation
‘described, and the latter a true
story which, even though inhibited,
is probably the best the police ﬁlm
has produces.

The prospect of yet another
police film is hardly exciting.’ After
suffering through ‘such losers as
McQ and The Laughing Policeman,
just the mention of another police
ﬂick is going to elicit groans. The
idea of Robert Blake and Elliott
Gould starring in this one helps a
little, but not much.

So gang, here it is. Another epic

of our boys in blue that promises to
show you things you can't see on
TV. If that's a promise, it’s a
damned good incentive to go back
\to TV and get away from all this
police movie gore that is dripping
off the ﬁlm. After a while all that
violence gets pretty boring.
Whatever happened to good old
sex?

But’let’s not be too unfair in
judging Busting. To be honest, if it
hadn't come in this ﬂood of
blood-and-guts-behind-the-badge
movies it would be quite well
received. Even enjoyed, as far as
one can go enjoying a fairly violent
police movie. But right now it’s
just another number in a too-long
line.

Busting concerns two hard-
working dedicated (yawn) cops on
the vice squad, whose extralegal
methods for busting hookers,
massage parlor operators, etc. are
even more repugnant than the
criminals who may or may not get
their dues. Of -course it’s
eventually shown that the two cops
are rather embittered by having to
lie in court to get a suspect bounced
out because said suspect has
“friends." And they can't get a
search warrant to investigate a
possible drug pusher because the
sergeant’ doesn't want to wake a
judge at 1 am. And after chasing
three hoodlums through the streets
and the Farmers’ Market, and
shooting down two of them, the
third gets away because a
uniformed back-up unit was lax.

So our two heroes are rather
frustrated individuals when they
decide to go after the big man, the

people bounced out of jail. ‘it’s
hardly the most original plot of the
year. -—

But knowing that Gould and
Blake are playing the leads denotes
a different quality of character.
The two have made their trade-
marks in the off-beat line, Gould as
the bumbling, anxious neurotic and
Blake as the cool-veneered, strong
and glib neurotic. This time their
respective neuroses are manifested
by Gould's chewing gum (when
chasing aforementioned suspects
through the market he unwraps
another stick of gum while running
through the aisles) and Blake's by
an ubiquitous cigarette dangling
unlit from the corner of his mouth.
‘Blake also has several oppor-
tunities to hold back Gould from
beating the proverbial shit out of
somebody.

So thisis not a ﬂick where the
plot is tantamount, or for that
matter very important. What

makes the movie is the interplay .

and characterizations of these two
actors. who make an even more
effective team.than their screen
cops Keneely and Farrel (Gould
and Blake, respectively). Both
display a thoughtful sensitivity in
their anomic characters, finding
that all the dedication and hard
work they are capable of really
doesn’t accomplish much. They
have no friends other than each
other, and even on their free time
they're constantly on the _job. They
have shut themselves off from
everything but their work and each
other, not necessarily in that order.
And it’s simply enjoyable to
watch these two work in some of
the, lighter scenes, like when they,

crowd. Larger than an Ideas &

Larger than a Susan B. Anthony

What kind of party is this? “I

put it, “Apathy is not dead at

Grapplers’ Last Battle

BY G.W. STEVENS

The “moment of truth" has
ﬁnally arrived for the Pitt wrestling
team. Tonight and tomorrow they
take to the mats for wha may prove
to be the ﬁnal time this year. The
squad is presently in Annapolis,
Md. for the EIWA championships
and only those who ﬁnish in the top
four in their weight class will go on
to the NCAA championships in
Ames, Iowa.

At first glance, _the teams
chances do not look very good.
Few of the members of this year’s
squad have been able to ‘post
winning records. The young Pitt
grapplers are in much the same
position they were in last year
when only three of their ten entries
were able to move on. The lone Pitt
Eastern champion of last year,
Craig Tritch, is gone but a new
champion has emerged who will
hopefully carry the Panthers’ colors
to victory, 118-pound George
"Fuddy" Bryant.

Bryant has become this year’s
favorite to win the Eastern
118-pound title on the strength of
his 8-0 record which includes three
consecutive pins against Lock
Haven, Syracuse, and Penn State.
His outstanding performance in the
Lock Haven match promptedithe
visiting coach to label him “the
best 118-pound wrestler in the
country.” Fuddy finished third in
the EIWA tournament last year but
won’t be bothered by Mike Frick,

 

At East Championship?

his old nemesis, this year. Frick,
last year’s 118 champ from Lehigh,
has moved up to 126-pounds.

’ Although Frick may not be able
to pose a threat to Bryant, it
appears that he may give Rande
Stottlemyer all he can handle.
Stottlemyer is about the other only
serious contender the Panthers can
send to the mats. He will be
wrestling some of the toughest
competition in the tournament
which includes not only Frick, who
defeated him in a dual meet early
this year, but also the EIWA
126~pound champion of last year,
Penn State's John Fritz.

Fritz and Frick are expected to
stage a ﬁerce battle of their own for
this year's honors but Stottlemyer
can't be ruled out as an upset
winner. Rande drew with Fritz,
9-9. in last week's dual meet, but
outwrestled the sophomore cham-
pion. In any event, Stottlemyer has
a very good shot at winning a spot
in the NCAA.‘tournament to be held
in two weeks. _

After these two lightweights, the
rest of the.’ Pitt squad is one big
question mark. Jeff Minerd, last
year’s ru ner-up at 177 pounds,

has bee’ hampered all season by

ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR
For Buzz Ridl and his tentatively

llth ranked Pitt Panthers. taking
the bitter with the sweet wasn’t
hard at all Wednesday night in
South Carolina. '

The Cats dropped their second
consecutive game and third of the
season at the hands of the South
Carolina Gamecocks, 67-50, but the
sound thrashing the Panthers took
was eased somewhat by an NCAA
at-large bid extended to Pitt on
Thursday morning.

With the team enroute from South
Carolina, Athletic Director Casmir
Myslinski accepted the bid to the
Eastern Regionals.

“It pleases us because we haven’t
been to a tournament since 1964,”’
Myslinski said. “Regardless of the
location or the opponent, we’ll be
extremely happy just to be
playing.”

At that time Myslinski was not
informed of the site of the Pitt
game or the foe, but a later
announcement by the NCAA
cleared that up, much to the delight
of Pitt fans.

The Panthers will be playing the
winner of the MAC division, and
right now that will be either LaSalle
or St. Josephs, March 9, at
Mountaineer Coliseum, Morgan-
town, West Virginia.

Actually, the Pitt-SC contest had
no bearing on the NCAA’s decision
on the extension of bids. If it did,
the Cats might have been in
trouble.

The Gamecocks, who were also
battling for and have received an
at-large invitation, grabbed the
opening lead and never relin-
quished it. An extremely poor
shooting performance by the
Panthers in the first half sent any
hopes of a victory in Carolina
Coliseum down the drain.

Pitt shooters could manage only‘a
27.6 percentage in the opening 20
minutes, compared to the hot-

BY RICK STOUFFER

Think back to when you were a
kid and got a lot of fun from
watching an ant nest with those
crazy insects running around with
no purpose. The picture still lives,
describing the upcoming IC4A
track championships tomorrow and
Sunday in Princeton.

At least 50 teams will be jammed
into Jadwin Gymnasium with
hundreds of athletes trying -to
warm up and loosen tight muscles
before events.

The Pitt tracksters will be there
in full force, representing one of
the top teams in the meet.

“The IC4A’s are a big guessing
game,” according to Coach Jim
Banner. “The time schedule is so
crowded it takes a lot of luck just to
stay in contention. Each coach is
wondering what events which
runner is competing so he can
juggle his men around to get the
best results.”

Whatever the results. good times
are bound to happen. Jadwin Gym
has one of the ﬁnest tracks in the
country. “It's really a beautiful
track," Banner said. The only

 

 

.V ﬂy’,

     

handed Gamecocks, who ripped the
nets on slightly under half of their
attempts.

The Cats could hit on just eight of
29 throws from the ﬁeld while SC
pumped in 14 of 30 and two of ﬁve
from the line. ‘

Billy Knight remained mired in a
scoring slump, notching on seven
of 17 attempts while putting up
with double coverage from the
Carolina defense. Pitt's leading
scorer has tallied just 38 points in
his last three outings, perhaps the
teams’ three most important
contests on the schedule.

Brian Winters, South Carolina's
sensational senior guard, sunk 12
points in the ﬁrst half, including a
fantastic jumper before the buzzer.
The Gamecocks inbounded the ball
with less than a minute left
following a traveling call on
Knight, worked the ball to Winters,
and watched the only senior starter
put on a one man dribbling show
before he ﬁnally put it up to give
SC a 30-16 lead at the half.

Ridl was pleased with the way the
Cats came back in the second half,

Vchipping the Gamecock lead to

seven points on three different
occasions, but the Carolina hot
shooting streak matched Pitt's new
found success and them some.
Winters added 11.more points to
give him a game-high 23 while
Mike Dunleavy finished off the
night a close second with 17 points.
Alex English added 13 and frosh
Nate Davis 10 on the evening.
Pitt’s Tom Richards provided
some excellent shooting from the
outside. something that his team-
mates desperately needed to
challenge the Gamecock's famed
2-3 one defense. by hitting on ﬁve
of eight jumpers mainly from the
top of the key.
A 50 percent outing from the ﬁeld

in the second half helped the»

Panthers and that's how ‘Buzz Ridl

turns. There will probably be a lot
of spills on them.'.'

Commenting on who the tough
teams will be, Banner flashed a
smile. “Pitt of course will be a
tough team overall. Villanova.
Navy. Penn State, and Manhattan
should be the tougher teams.
Cornell from the Ivy League looks
good also."

One of Pitt’s big standouts all
year has been the two mile relay
team which has dominated com-
petition all year. Despite the great
showing of the team, 3rd fastest in
the East, it surprisingly will not be
running at the Easterns.

“The way the relays are being
set up, all three relays are ran one
after another (the mile. two mile.
and the distance medley). To do a
good job. a team would have to
have 12 guys to run each race well.

“Unless a team has a superstar
who can run more than one race."

V Banner continued. the coach must

choose which relay to run."

Skaters Grab Top Spot

BY YAIER LEHRER

Tuesday night's Pitt hockey
game against the Fighting Saints of
Penn State (McKeesport) could
very well have been titled Tuesday
Night at the Fights. The Saints
could not put anything together
against a tremendously over-
powering Pitt squad, except for a
few right crosses and uppercuts, as
the Cats skated all over them,
emerging with a 7-0 victory at the
Alpine Arena to put Pitt in sole
possession of ﬁrst place in the
WPIHA.

The Penn Staters were out to
avenge an earlier 13-2 drubbing by
the Pitt club and for the opening
minutes of play displayed a
passable defense, although not
generating any great deal of
offense, amassing only eight shots
on goal for the entire three periods

- of play.

The Cats st;rt5';clE"qu,i,ck1y, though.
and with only/,2‘:36 gone in the first
period, Denny Browne took a

Charlie Hagins faceo'ff in the Penn
State zone and slapped the puck
past Saint goalie Chuck Mar-
Vchionne to make the score 1-0. For
the rest of the period, though, it
was a defensive battle with the
Panthers showing some weak
passing on offense, but an almost
ﬂawless defense.

With just over three minutes to
go in the first period, Gary
Cummings and Matt Pihony of
PSM got involved in one of a series
of fights between the two teams
when Cummings tried to poke the
puck away from the PSM player
and Pihony responded with an
elbow.

The Cats had the one man
advantage in the beginning of the
second period since Cummings got
one minor penalty and the PSM
player picked up two. The Cats
didn't score on the power play, but
as soon as the Saint player came.
back on the ice, Rick Vernon took a
pass in front of the net from Denny

In the middle of the second
period, Russ Stump and Jim Davis

disagreement as Stump high-

marks. “Freshman Don Betterly is

Banner explained.

Andre Harris (third in the
country with a 7.4 mark in the 60
yard high hurdles‘) is hard to tell.
He hasn't been in competition
since the Pitt Invitational-, ﬁrst with
a hamstring pull and then because
of personel problems.

“It's hard to tell about Andre,”
Banner said. “He might not have
his timing or rhythm down pat
missing so much time.”

Another question mark is high
jumper Tim Riley. Riley injured his
back last week missing the pit at
the Ohio State Invitational and
might not be up to top form.

Stump also picked up a ﬁve minute
penalty for highsticking, giving
PSM a one man advantage for ﬁve
minutes.

The Pitt defense, however, did
not let the Saints have one shot on
goal in the entire five minute span
and only after Bobby Arturo was
called on a very questionable
boarding call were the Saints able
to penetrate far enough to get one
of their two shots on goal for that
period. .

NIT
Starts
Selections

NEW YORK AP--Hawaii, a
relative newcomer, and St. John’s,
Manhattan and Massachusetts,
three “old friends” of the National
Invitational Tournament, were
selected Thursday for the annual
college basketball event at Mad-

_ ison Square Garden.

Hawaii, 17-7 with two regular-
season games remaining against"
Memphis State, was named for its
second NIT appearance several
hours after the other three teams
had been picked.

Their selections" left 13 teams to
be chosen for the 37th NIT March
16-24, a task that has been made
harder because of a new post
season starter-the Collegiate Com-
missioner Association Tournament.

St. John’s will be making its
22nd NIT appearance in a bid for a
fifth title while its New York City
rival, Manhattan, will be trying for
its first NIT championship with a
12th appearance.

Massachusetts will be making its

I fourth NIT appearance in the last

ﬁve years and also will be trying for
a first title.

St. John's currently is 19-5 with
regular season games left against
Providence and St. Francis, N.Y.,
and is on an 11-game winning
streak.

The Redmen, led by center Ed
Searcy and Guard Mel Utley, won
the Connecticut Classic and fin-
ished second in the Eastern
Collegiate Athletic Conference
Holiday Festival earlier in the
season.

The NIT annually has been hurt
by the National Collegiate Athletic
Association’s system of making
at-large bids to major independents
for its tournament. And this year

the talent drain has been increased .

by the" CCA, which has been
assured of representatives, other
than the champions, of eight major
conferences.

The NCAA selected its nine‘
at-large teams Thursday, including
second—ranked Notre Dame, the
NIT runnerup last year.

 

 

McKeesport was called for holding,
giving Pitt the power play. In the
beginning of the third period they
cashed in on it as Vernon, assisted
by Grey Nintz and Denny Browne,
got a wrist shot past the PSM
goalie to give him his second goal
of the game on his way to his
second hat trick in the past two
games.

From then on, the game
belonged to Pitt and the Penn State
team, even on the power play,

could not penetrate into the Pitt.

zone, getting only one shot on goal
through the entire period.

Denny Browne, who was in-
volved in five of the seven goals

scored by the Cats, scored his’

second goal of the evening,
unassisted from the corner of the
net. Just one minute later Charlie
Hagins scored his goal for the
night, assisted by Denny Browne

and Rick Vernon, to put the Cat’s
up by five.

And if they hadn't already, the
Penn State team fell apart at the
seams, as Gary Davis, called for
two minutes for elbowing, received
a 10 minute misconduct and ﬁnally
a game misconduct for directing

' obscenities at the ofﬁcails, which
‘ seemed to be the only thing that

either the Penn State team or the
fans could do well all game long.

To put the icing on the cake Joe
Testa scored unassisted followed
shortly by Rick Vernon’s third goal
of the evening with assists from
Denny Browne and Charlie Hagins
to give the Cats the ﬁnal score of
7-0.

Gymnasts Host Army

In Season Finale

BY ANDY BEHREND

Pitt's ﬁnal gymnastics meet of
the season will be against Coach Ig
Perez’ previous loyalty, Army,
Saturday afternoon. at 1:30 in the
Trees Hall gym.

Though winless in all their dual
meets this season, the Panthers
have improved tremendously since
last year. Their overall meet total
has risen an average of more than
thirty points per match.

When congratulated for the job
he has done, Perez is quick to point
out two other factors that make his
occupation easier.

“Our assistant coach, Elliot
Sanft has done a tremendous job
for us. He is always there, every
practice, every meet, and he’s not
even getting paid for it.”

Sanft, who graduated from Pitt
last year, is emminently able to
assist Perez. He was captain of the
gymnastics team last year.

The other factor in making Perez

-a success at Pitt are the gymnasts

themselves.
“We are a very young team and
we’re learning together,” Perez

said. “They extend themselves
and work so hard which makes it

that much easier. Plus they’re all ‘

for each other and root each other
on.”

139.40, against South Connecticut.
A score in the 140's would be a
ﬁtting end to the year.

Freshmen Rob Pasterick and Gus
Papantonio have bettered their
scores consistently as all-around
men. The neck injury suffered by
Don Stevenson earlier in the year

has prohibited his all-around.

improvement.
Total. team effort has been this
