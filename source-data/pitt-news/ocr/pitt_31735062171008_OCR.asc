HARRISBURG — Over 100 stu-
dents from Indiana University of
Pennsylvania (IUP). a state own-
ed institution. came here to lobby
to their state senators and repre-
sentatives for an increase in allo-
cations to their school.

, Gary J. Belonzi. president of
IUP’s Student Government. work-
ed as one of tiie organizers oi the
effort because he believes that
"only through student effort can
we hope to get the Commonwealth
to give us the funds necessary for
clearing the schools $5.5_million
deficit."

IUP, a university of about 10,-
000 students, received $11.5 mil-
lion for the fiscal year 1972-73.
The result of this allowance,
which amounted to $1,100 per stu-
dent as opposed to the $1,900 per
student received by institutions
such as Pitt and Penn State, re-
sulted in the cut-back of 130 fac-
ulty and staff positions as well as
a cutback of $3.2 million in other
operating costs.

Belonzi explained that IUP‘

would needabout $17.680.100 for
the upcoming year. an increase of
$5.3-10.900 0 over Shapp’.s propos-
ed, budget allocation to IUP. This
amount would cover the costs of
improving the library. sp01‘ts fac-
ilties. dormitories. and permit
135 new staff and faculty posi-
tions.

David Kolega. acting second
vice-president of
vania State Association of Stu-
dent Government. said. "We are
the children of todays taxpa_vers.
nearly 98 per cent of the students

the Pennsyl-'

at the 14 state—owned schools are
Commonwealth residents — and
therefore our money should be
paying for our education."

Kolega also discussed the dem-
onstrations _ being planned for
Thursday and Friday of this week,
as well as the “massive demon-
stration” planned for Harris-
burg on May '1", “which has been
the traditional day for expressing
protest.”

Though lUP Student Govern-
ment President Belonzi was pessi-
mistic about the "immediate re-
sults" of theirday in Harrisburg.
he feels that "we can be a cata-
lyst for further efforts on the part
of Pennsylvania students to get
the state to support public edu-
cation." '

Gail Smith. editor of the IUP
student newspaper. who also

‘helped organize the expedition to

Harrisburg. explained that though
the University's administration
was ‘sympathetic and pleased
with the effort they could not
in any real way support it because
of their status as state em-
ployees." a

Smith discussed the general
feeling about the Shapp admin-
istration’s budget on -the IUP
campus, stressing that for a
“generally apathetic, apolitical,
and easy-going bunch ofstudents”
the» questions about “the impor-
tance of quality education” raised
by the proposed allocations to
IUP, had “fired up a considerable

amount of interest.”

IUP students also remarked on
the "poor academic situationf

ting very much out of it because
of the state's cutbacks."

Belonzi summarized the stu-
dent feelings. stating. "We have

to do something. Our school is_

going downhill far too fast. And
this is why we are here today.
hoping to make some headway
with the men who are supposed-

Boycott Proposed to

Greek Control Denied ,

» by JOHN POULIN

Several members of Student
Government voiced their concern
Wednesday over the fraternity
phone calls which threatened to
use Greek power in SG against the
allocation request by the Black
Action Society.

The SG members denounced the
implication that_the calls repre-
sented "threats from’ Student
and refuted the

tion request would be in danger
becausethe Greeks control Stu-

dent Government."

SG President Rege Kaufman
said of the callers, “We don’t
know who they are or why they
did it.” But the false implications,
he said, could “jeopardize SG’s'
funding program.”

The board asserted that the Al-
locations Committee is represen-
tative of the students at large and
is neither "run by the Greeks"
nor by any other group with lob-
bying interests. "Two of the eight
members on the committee belong
to fraternities." they said. “but
only one is an active member." '

"Today Black students put the
Black Action Society on ‘The Rail‘
—and we need to keep it there."
said newly elected BAS Chair-
man sophomore Bill‘Kilson.

Also ‘elected. was Deputy Chair
man junior Namosha Smith.,V'ot-
er turnout was placed at near 50
percent. '

In a Pitt News interview imme-
diately after election results were
announced,.Kilson said he was

“tired, hungry, and nervous”;'

Smith said she “felt pretty good.”

The goals of the .two in their
new positions were discussed.
Smith said she felt there should
be more emphasis on academic
programming in different fields
of knowledge." It's important to
get Blacks interested in the edu-
cational process —— what the-y‘re
doing and why they‘re here. Also.
more political progress will ef-
fect Black students directly—we

viewed "objectively."

Former   S. G.

by JIM MONAHAN,

Another motion not to accept
the recommendation that former
officers _of Student Government
organizations be remunerated
was passed at the March 27 Stu-

dent Government Board, meeting.

Representatives from the Re-
muneration Committee of the old
Student Government Board had
asked that payment for services
rendered to retroactive to Sep-
tember. 1972.

According to former SG Board
member Ken Kreniky, last year’s
board had‘ expected that they
would be paid when the Alloca-
tions Board approved the method
of remuneration, but “didn’t think
it was right to push this through
at our last meeting.”

Kreniky further assured the
Board. "We aren’t trying to get
more money for ourselves. Olli-
cers of many large student organ-
izations aren't able to get sum-
mer jobs because of their work
load and deserve sotne kind of
i'emunei'ation." ‘

Board member Sue Ruifner
countered this with the rationale
that "the criteria for such rein-
uneration is arbitrary; you can‘t
measure how much money former
officers really deserve.

President Rege Kaufmann felt
that the proposition was merely a
ploy to ‘.‘pay back” former board
members who pushed through the
remuneration policy for the cur-
rent board.

in other action. board member
Mike Furick reported that the
rumor that stoves would be re-
moycd from Holland Hall next
year is taise. The only exception
will be stoves showing gas leak-
ages. these will be iemoycd at
the cizd oi this term.

Dave Wahl. from. the C()lIllTlll~i

that only 60 organizations have

recognition by the board. At least

 Ellen Ganley, this years pres-
T .ident. said that last year the AWS

who applied for a position got it.

I "This: year we decided to have an

election because we want to make

should be. We want to get more

 people involved," she emphasized.

I AWS _is' a national organization

i‘ which acts asa governing body

' for women at colleges and univer-

 sities. It is the largest of its type.
. - Ganley pointed out that until sev-
; _en years ago, AWS at Pitt en-

events it sponsored wasthe an-
nual “Lantern Night" which has
recently been discontinued be-
cause it was too expensive. In re-
cent years. AWS has sponsored
the "Womens’ Cultural Festival"
and was responsible for bringing
Bernadette Devlin, Betty Friedan.
and other speakers to Pitt.

Ganley pointed out that AWS is
changing: “It used to be ‘tradi-
tion oriented,' but now it is involv-
ed in the liberalist movement
which was inevitable. However.

by MIKELSCHMITTI

Dr. Robert Hines from the
Academy of Applied Sciences.
spoke about the Loch Ness Mon-
ster Tuesday in the Student Union.

The lake of Loch Ness, between
500 and 1.000 feet deep. is located
in northern Scotland.

Rines indicated that there was

-definitely some animate object,

45 to 65 feet long, living in the
lake. -

Research began four years ago
when a film of a large animal was
turned into the authorities. Pre-
sently, sonars and special high
speed cameras are being used to

A track the monster.

Rine showed photographs of a
creature with very rough skin and

vealed a fin which appears toibe

Last summer, according to
Rines, a two man submarine was
employed in the monster hunt, but
poor visibility hindered the pro-
ject. Two other unknown animals
however, were discovered.

One of the two resembles an
"aquatic bumble bee." and he
other “seems to be a crustac-"ea."

yet to date they remain uniden- '

tified species.

Rines said the biggest problem
in the hunt was the murky lake

water. He is hopeful that some .

better photographs can be taken
with improved techniques.

The British Museum and var-
ious universities have recognized
the monster and plan to provide
funds for an expedition. according
to Hines. The British Navy is
considering sending a sub-chaser
in an attempt to" force the crea-
ture to the surface.

ganization in the country.

Capitman further explained that
the boycott "it massive enough
will lower tmeati prices.“ but the
“long range effect is hard to say."

The most powerful etfect of the
boycott. according to Capitnian.
will be “to put the government
and politicians on notice to the
large support that the boycott has.
Because." he continued. "unless
there is strong governmental ac-
tion. the boycott. unless extended.
will not have any great tasting
ettect."

However, Dr. Paul F. Lazars‘-
feld, sociology professor, feels
that it will take a long time to find
out if the consumer boycott is ef-
fective, althoughi as a part of the
general trend in.the area of con-
sumer reaction, the latest grass-
roots movement has been quite
successful.

Lazai‘sleld. who is currently
teaching a course on Public Opin-
ion in the University. looks upon
the strike. or boycott.as a part of
public opinion. He sees this pub-
lic opinion as having been "coor-
dinated by the television news. al-

 5;  I-‘can think of no way to slow down the great
 iing flurry of commentary about the financial
 s ofthe University. While I cannot halt this de-
; gpment, I feel I should be doing something about
I or that reas’on. I am contributing yet another
 '.lSSI011 of matters fiscal within the University
munit_y. ' ‘
  c.urious fact emerges from the verbiage sur-
 iding this institution’s ongoing slide toward in-
V';‘,i,‘fll3le bankruptcy. This is the University of Pitts-
I -ugh. It is currently in desperate straits because

S.G. Responds

Dear Ms. Sexton:

As I picked up a copylol Wed-
nesday. March 21. 197:5. edition of
the Pitt News, an article on the
front page happened to catch my
eye. concerning threatening calls
to the Black Action Society office.

As I read through the article.
one comment particularly arous-
ed me. It concerned the fact that
the caller stated that "the BAS
allocation request would be in
danger because the Greeks con-
trol Student Government. also.

sented direct threats from Stu-
dent Government.

-These comments are absolute-
ly false, and very new to me, be-
cause the first time I ever saw

places known only as “University of” that our uni-
que qualities would be lost in all the confusion.

Several solutions to this dilemma present

themselves.

Our great nation is the home of many enormous
corporations. Most of them are more solvent than
our cities; several are richer than the average coun-
try. This great source of wealth and potential com-
fort should not be left untapped. ‘

Some might be more interested than others in

. supportingius. The companies which manufacture

cigarettes. for instance. are no longer allowed to
advertise their products on television. They have no
use for the vast sums they ‘used to expend on such
advertising. For a mere five million or so a _vear.
such a company could arrange to have our school
named for it. Thence forward. all our exploits.
athletic an academic. would be credited to. say.
the University of Marlboro. ' 1

A more peculiar, but still tenable, situation
would prevail under the banner of another brand of
cigarettes. If we became the “University of.Lucky
Strike,” I expect that there would be pressure ex-

erted to change the name of our athletic champions

from the“‘Panthers” to the “Greens.”

Then. every weekend during autumn and at
other times throughout the year. the Lucky Strike
Greens could go to war.

Other brand names would present their own
problems. but all of them could be solved.

1 am losing interest in this proposal. Fiscall_v
it may be sound. but it smacks a. bit too much of
the commercial. Fortunately, another alternative
has just occurred to me. It is connected with there-
cent drive to democratize the university and‘its
works and its pomps; It also plays on the most re-
liable of human characteristics.

The characteristic to which I just referred so

archl’y is that of ambition. All of us suffer it; every
time another boulevard is dedicated to the mem-

ory of a Kennedy, or a King, or even a Wallace,

some spark of envy stirs in the breast of the finest
of us. How are these men different from the com-
mon run of mankind to the degree that everything
is named for them and nothing is named for me?

I propose a lottery. mtich like the one promoted
with such success by the Commonwealth of Penn-
sylvania. The prize would not be money. Very few
people win money in lotteries anyway. so this will
not be the handicap it seems. ‘

The winner would have the former University
of Pittsburgh named for him for the period of 'one
year. We would perhaps be the University of Harry
Blanding one year. and the Universityof Sophia
Loren the next. Q

Runner-up could have parking spaces named
for them.

Ambition being what it is. the lottery might
well’ generate more . money than the University
could find a use for. In that event. I will volunteer
my services and single-handedly dispose of the stir-
plus. .

Editor. The Pm News:

I'd like to congratulate the Pitt
News on their "excellent" cover-
age of Greek Week ‘73 and also of

the coverage of the Greeks over

the past year.

To be more specific. I found it
very disgusting to think that the
Pitt News, labeled as "Collegiate
Journalism" to practically ig-
nore the accomplishments of the
Greeks at Pitt. especially after
a week such as last week. Who
else has collected close to $10.-
000 for the benefit of the Kidney
Foundation. and has donated prac-
tically 260 pints of blood to the
Central Blood Bank over the
course of a few weeks. not to men-
tion other similar activities
throughout ‘the rest oi the year
with the individual fraternities
and sororities. Also. what other
organization has the largest mem-
bership that the.Greeks have—ap-
proximately 10 per cent of the stu-
dent population—10 per cent not
only involved in the Greek sys-'
tem but also. involved in other
campus activities to help better
the situation at Pitt for all the
students. '

These are justia few of the
Greek achievements and who else
can boast such a record? I don’t
believe anyone can, and if there
is such an organization that has,

~ they too are getting cheated.out

of the recognition due them.

Another comment I’d like to
make concerns your cartoon that
appeared on page four of the
March 26. 1973 issue. I found the
cartoon far from humorous and
close. very close to sick. It was
as downgrading as one’ can possi-
bly get and I think that the per-
sonresponsible owes us an apolo-
gy. I. believe it’s about time that
the Greeks at Pitt receive some
recognition and admiration for
the glory.they bring to Pitt. They
deserveit!

ROTC Ball  

Editor. The Pitt News:

I hesitate to respond to the
charges that Mr. Capitman.level-
ed at the Military Ball in the
March 12 issue because it might
in some way give credence to his
noise.‘ Since I am in ROTC and
helped plan the Ball. it may be
worthwhile to those who didn‘t
come to briefly describe a mili-

‘tary ball.

A mil ._ball_-is simply a‘/dinner-.

Letters to the Editor .

dance to which cadets come and
enjoy themselves. This year non-
ROTC Pitt students were invited
at the same reasonable price-$5
couple. There is usually a buffet
hot roast
beef. breaded chicken. sea shells

in tomato sauce. potato salad. cole-

slaw and much else. There were

.also cold cuts and assorted
Cheeses for those who‘ wanted
sandwiches.

At any group function — wheth-
er it be a party or a meeting-the
host welcomes the guests-and
takes their, coats. He (she) does
not simply ignore them. At the
Ball, everyone coming in was
greeted by those who helped or-
ganize the affair—the Mil Ball

commanders and the cadet com- ‘

manders and were directed to the
check room. I did not realize that
courtesy offended people (or was

it just Mr. Capitman?). If’cour- '

tesy is being shunned by my gen-
eration (I do not think it is),

' I want no part of it.

The real pity is that Capitman.
after several paragraphs illustrat-
ing mental confusion. admits that
"the above is perhaps an-unfair
description.” Apparently he can-
not make up his mind. But wait.
he finally concedes that he would-
n‘t subject his worst enemy to
such a fate. Does this sound like
consistenc_v‘? Does his "lack of
sympathy toward ROTC" nur-
ture a "detached view” even in
the broadest sense? .

I am wondering if his utterings
illustrate a sensitive perception
of those connected with the Mili-
tary Ball and ROTC or a set of
preconceived notions fertilized by
a paranoia of anything military.
I tend to think the latter. At any
rate. if John Amson Capitman
hates us. we can't be all bad.

completely staged show with num-
b€I_‘S from Cabaret, Promises,
Promises, Man of La Mancha and
others.

Jim Maloy, stage director, has

HOLLIDAYSBURG, Pa. (AP)-
Skeleton on fragments of an Ice
Age mastodon, estimated to be be-
tween 10.000 and one million-
million-years-old. have been un-
earthed in a wall of a limestone

quarry deep in the Appalachian

Mountain range near this central-
western Pennsylvania commun-
ity.

The bones, embedded in a 50-
foot-by-five-foot red class fis-
sure in the quarry wall, were dis-
covered initially by two local men
who were target shooting in-the
long-abandoned excavation.

Dr. Roger Cuttey. a Penn State

University paleontologist.-is work-
ing on the find.

Cuffey said he plans to attempt.

to date the remains using the Car-
ton 14 and amino acid methods,
but he indicated that a prelimin-
ary study puts the age of the find
probably between 10,000 and
200,000 -years old. ,

He speculated that-the young
mastodon was traveling with a
herd across the mountain range
when it tumbled into the fissure
and died there.

'The information in the above

story. just as it came in on the
teletype. is interesting but hardly
startling. By now all of the masto-
dons which once roamed the hills
of Pennsylvania have perished;

the fate of a single such creature. ‘

however, young. is a matter of
passing interest at best.

A member of the University’s
Department of Paleoteratology,
however, has contributed a fur-
ther speculation which raises
this touching story above the lev-
el of simple human interest.

Dr. Rupert Fudge. associate
chairman of thedepartment. has
been a widely respected author-
ity on such matters since his bril-
liant days as a graduate student
at Mosozoic University. He is a
native of Pennsylvania. and. as a
boy roamed the very hills near
Hollidaysburg where the bones
were found.

"I know the area well,“ he said
in an exclusive interview, "wind.
it the dates indicated by prelimin-
arytesting prove to be accurate.
I may be able to explain the trag-
ic end of such a young creature
so many years ago.

“If, in fact, the animal died
more than 10,000 years ago, it

Hapless Mammal   Perishes

was undoubtedly the victim of a
traffic mishap. In those days,
Route 22 was new, and, at Holli-
daysburg, was very difficult to
cross even for a nature and nim-
ble mastodon.

"If, however. the remains prove
to be less than 10.000 years old.
they would belong to the Early
Deciduous period. My method of
-Asphalt Dating shows conclusive-
ly that during this period the first
potholes appeared on Route 22.
This remains true even though
individual potholes on "the Turn-
pike have been shown to date to
an even earlier period.

“Thus it is clear that accurate
dating of this recent find is im-
perative. and should be carried
out as quickly as is consistent
with accuracy. I will make my

superb facilities available; I hope"

that academic jealousy will not
hamper work on this momentous
discovery."

"In addition. there is always
danger that a ‘careless reader
might imagine that this is a news
story. when it is actually an-
other lighthearted prank and
dreamed up by the pixies In the

“/vlarl<i's America," A Nomad's Travelogue

by LARRY PANSINO

Mark Bristow. producer of a
recorded the
footage while traveling around

‘the country. He said he prefers

his nomadic, non-materialistic

_ lif_e style to more traditional ones.

“Living on the road is the only

 _way for me,” said ‘Bristow, a
‘3 ~ transplanted Englishman
‘ A filmed and edited “Mark’s Amer-

who

ica—A Film Diary”. “I have no
plans to stop traveling and make
a lot of money to escape that
life because I’m already doing

‘ what I like.

"In some waysmy life style
is insecure. but through it I can
realize the shallowness of mater-
ial possessions. I feel that people
who base their lives on jobs and
houses are basing it on quick-

‘ sand.

, "Being on the road means that
home is wherever you are. It‘s
hard to adjust to nomadic lit'e at
first; I had a‘ middle class up-

-_._-bringing and was taught tradi-

tional values. but these values
aren‘t right for me.

“My life style is why I’m here
in America. I came to the States
five years ago on a vacation and
loved the immense size of Ameri-
ca so I stayed. I can travel con-
tinuously and always see new
places.” A

Bristow produced the film.
shown this week in the Student
L7nion‘s \enetian ltoom.
traveling between college cam-
puses where he showed Channel
Ones production of Groove Tube.

Covering over 100.000 miles in
48 states during an 18-month
period. he tried to capture every-
day. yet eyecatching. moments
in American life. like a young
man cultivating marijuana or the
magnificent scenery of the ltocky
Mountains.

“I never intended making a
polished film for other people
while I was shooting the footage.
It was simply a visual diary that
I wanted to keep. I looked for
peculiar or interesting incidents.

The film doesn't try to make
America look good or bad, it’s
just my observations and feelings.

"I paid for its production
out of my wages from Channel
One. In December 1970. I start-
ed filmiiig. finished by May
1972. and spent four solid months
editing it. I had 18 hours of film
and had to reduce that to four 45-
minute films which are shown
simultaneously. one film for each
timezone.

"You have to keep only the
film segments that are of most
interest. and sometimes its hard
to cut out your own work. Many

segments that went into the fin— _

ished production are short flashes.
Generally. I've tried to give each
film its own coherence."

Bristow said he kept a film
diary because a written one would
have only produced a jumble of
blurred memories.

“I’ve had no trouble at all with
people or local authorities through-
out my travels, despite my long
hair and living out of a Volks-
wagon van with New York state
license plates. You have to over-.
come your paranoia and approach
people as individuals, not labels.
People are really much better than
Spiro Agnew and Jerry Rubin
paint them as being.

“Rarely do I film strangers.
It doesn‘t seem right to intrude
on peoples lives just because I"m
carrying a camera.”

While the film was shown.
Bristow played taped folksy
music which he chose to reflect
his emotions as he was film-
ing the scenes. He recalled that
during much of the time he felt
a driving elan. with intermittent
peaks and quieting moments.

“I experience two conflicting
strands of time on the road,” he
said. “Because everyday I do and
see very varied things, time
seems expanded. The diverse
impressions of two weeks travel-
ing make that period seem much
longer in retrospect. The last
three years seem longer than

“More Rich Rags"

the whole remaining 29 years of
my life.”

Bristow is planning a sequel
to Mark's America to be ‘filmed
during his future travels. He
would also like to eventually take
his productions back to Europe
to show the people there another.

fresher look at America. Similarly.

he looks forward to doing such a
film about Great Britain and ex-
hibitingitin the LIS. ,

“Im not homesick for England I

but would like to return out of
curiosity. I have a suspicion that
behind the Englishman's bount-

_ eous courtesies are a great deal

of frustration and anger. One of
the charms of Americans is
their habit of confronting each
other." "

by STEVE LUBETSKY

Lite to Eric Leeds is a matter
and
though he insists that "no one
can find the right notes." the bari-
tone saxist in Matrix nevertheless
has the knack of contriving in-
spiring combinations on his reeds.

In addition to Leeds. Don De-
Paolis on piano. Howard Bennett
on drums. Dave LaRocca on
bass. and percussionist Juhuru
comprise one of the most exciting
jazz outfits in Pittsburgh today.
each representing a unique solu-
tion to Leeds‘ problem.

Success in their doing so comes
in part from each member’s seem-
ingly endless credentials. Leeds
has paid dues with such talents
as Lenny Glick and currently is
a member of the Duquesne Uni-
versity Jazz Ensemble. A former
student of Bernard Cerelli, head

clarinetist in the Pittsburgh Sym- ‘

phony, Leeds is now studying
with saxophone whiz Eric Kloss.
Recently he was offered a job
with the James Brown Orchestra,
“but I turned it down because
I was in school then, and I felt
that continuing my education was
more important.”

DePaolis has worked with Tom
who recorded
DePaoli's composition “Conscious-
ness." and Nate Davis. He also
played on Davis’s album Maka-
tuka. Currently teaching piano at

said Leeds. But as Alan Leeds.
Eric's brother and manager of
the quintet summarized. "Their
music is indescribable. People

have been looking for words to-

describe it (jazz) for years. btit
the truth is that _vou have to feel
it."

According to Alan. the music.
of Matrix is an expression or
the "group theory." “I:Jver_vone
in the group contributes to cre-
ativity. the emancipation of the
rhythm section makes it such."
he stated.

"There is no one main per-
son.’ said Bennett. “We write
as a group. This is rare in jazz."
heiadded. “since there are very
few jazz groups. Most 'group_s
feature leaders with a back-up
But the group is
where it's at as far as collective
music is concerned. "

“Matrix” will take its collec-
tive aproach to the recording
studio when it records its forth-
coming debut album. “We want
to do" an album within three
months, and several major com-
panies have shown interest,”
Alan revealed. “With a jazz
group, the only way to get in
with a big company is to do
something of commercial value
and shove it right at them,”, he
said.

To Matrix. studio sessions are
hardly novel. "With the previ-

ous personnel. we recorded an
album which will never be heard."
Alan admitted. "This is be-
cause two members of that group
are no longer present. and musi-

cally. the group is changing
and maturing rapidly."
Despite the mutual interplay

within the band. "a group of this
caliber playing this kind of mu-
sic. is extremely difficult to keep
together." Bennett related. “es-
pecially in Pittsburgh. because of
the lack of clubs to play. Even
the jazz clubs are not looking
for original material."

Accounting for the mass apathy
towards jazz, Alan conjectured
that “jazz is Black emotional mu-
sic, a music of the people and
product‘ of life, whereas Western
civilization is, accustomed to
taking art as a formal thing.

"In Western culture." Alan con-
tinued. "pop music has never
been accepted asa formal thing.
Never has a jazz musician been
classified as an intellectual lead-
er. All leaders in jazz have been
gu_vs such as Charlie Parker. who
didn't care twere uninhibitedi.
Jazz people: such as the Modern
Jazz Quartet. recognized by West-
ern society. get that acceptance

because tliey__wear tvtix_ed'o__s."‘

e Right Notes

DiPaolis compared people's out— '

look towards jazz with dental
health. ".\'o one knows good den-
tistry from bad dentistry." he
postulated. "If you go to a bad
dentist. you assume that he knows
his trade. since he is certified. So
you don't ask questions. Jazz
musicians don‘t have that piece
of paper to show that they know.
There is a lack of dignity given

. tojazz musicians.“

Bennett asserted that “the pub-
lic associates any form of music
with entertainment. whereas
people seriously into music look
at it as contributing to their exist-
ence." He pointed out that "there
are many good jazz groups in
the city. such as Roger Humph-
ries and Spider Ron Dihelli. who
are suffering. and who could be
more creative but for lack of
work."

With these frustrations, how-
ever, alsocome moments of grati-
fication for those artists equipped
to withstand the hardships. For
Eric, the greatest satisfaction is
“finding the right notes, which
is what music is all about.
There are so many millions of
notes you can play, and with the
right notes being in the air, you

just have to reach out and grab

them.”

Monassas Provides Solid Back-Up

Stills Rocks lArena

By BARBARA GERAUD

Stephen Stills Superstar was at the Arena
Tuesday. proving once again that he is no Super-
star. He may think he is. but only when he's got
competent people (like Manassas) behind him.
can he show real greatness. '

Its not that the show was bad—t'ar from it.
It was a good. tight. rocking performance. While
Manassas was on. Stills said at one point. “my
name is Steve Stills and I'm a member of a
group called Manassas.“ but it was clear that he
was the star.

The down part of "the night was Stills’ solo
segment. The show had opened with the full
band, doing several new songs from an album to
be released in two weeks, and some oldies, most
notably “Johnny’s Garden, “Rock ‘n’ Roll Craz-
ies,” and “Go Back Home,” which they turned
into ten minutes of together rock—great wah-wah
effects from Stills coupling with Al Perkins’
pedal steel.

But then Stills did his little acoustic bit-

"Change Partners." "Know You Got To Run."-

"Black Queen.” -"Crossroads" (the old Robert
Johnson’/Cream one). “You Can't Catch Me." and
"Word Game." His voice was horribly out of
shape. Someone said that Pittsburgh was one of
the last dates on the tour; I don‘t know. but when
it came to singing, we certainly got the short end.

“Black -Queen” was exceptional, as long as

Stills wasn’t singing. He played an acoustic slide
guitar, and it was a much looser and more impro-

' visational number than the recording. The slide

bar gave the guitar an eerie sound, quite effec-
tive with that number. Stills is one of the more
accomplished guitarists of our day, and this song
showed it.

He wasn‘t too pleased with the reception he
was getting from the crowd. There were a cou-
ple putdowns-one when he said that he “couldn’t
be much more down than the audience was."
but he really didn't give us that much to get ex-
cited about until the second electric set.

"Word Game" was excellent; the first time
Stills showed a glimmer of how good he really
can be when he works at it. And the crowd was
receptive. giving him a standing ovation at the
end. I think it was more for what he used to be.
tough, rather than for what he is now. -

Chris Hillman, late of the Byrds and Flying
Burrito Brothers, is Stills’ mainstay in this group.

Playing one helluva great mandolin and provid- A

ing the majority of the harmonies, his addition
is one of the best moves Stills could have made.
Hillman had his own solo segment after Stills’
doing “Lovin’ Satisfies” and’ “Tomorrow’s a
Better Day,” two of his own compositions.

Then gradually, the rest of the group came
back . . . First Stills and Joe Lala, on congos, do-
ing (Both of Us) Bound to Lose," and "Love the
One You're With” (with some chilling harmonies
by Hillman; it was a new arrangement). Then a
quick (segue into “Fallen Eagle." featuring Hill-
man's mandolin and Al Perkins‘ steel. and sound-
ing much better than the record. I v

It was é_l good show, but the crowd wasn't as
appreciative as the band felt it should have been.
and Ithink that affected,/their performance. Lala
said afterwards that it was a "down" crowd. and
Stills just wouldn‘t talk about it—he felt he‘d
really tried to put his best into the show. and
couldn't understand why the reception wasn’t bet-
ter.

With only one starter gone from .

his 1972 squad, Pitt tennis coach
Fran Webster is eagerly antici-
pating the opening match of the
season, which is tomorrow after-
noon. when the Duqiiesne Dukes
“,'_"nost Pitt. The matches will be
3 held at the Schenley Oval tennis
courts, in Schenley Park, at 1 p.m.

The netters have been working
out all winter in the East Liberty
Courts, but Webster still isn't cer-
tain‘ of what his seeds will be, as
his basketball coaching _and re-
cruiting responsibilities have kept
-him from getting a really good

"The only definite spot is n'um- if

ber one. and that will be sopho-
more Joe Kantor," commented
Webster. “After that things
aren' ttoo certain."

Kantor earned the number one
slot as a freshman last season,

-and posted a 9-2 mark despite

facing the top players from each
school.

Gone from last year's squad is
Gary Schwartz. who was seeded
second, and battling for his spot

‘will be Joel Hurwitz, ‘Tom Cur-

°Fires’ Advance, 

?In; IM‘ Hoop

by R- S. SZYMUSIAK

The Forest Fires edged Economics by a score of 53-51 in the quar-
ter-finals of the Intramural Basketball Tournament Wednesday night.
Although the "Fires" held an overall advantage in height. bot teams-
played a very. physical game under the boards.

Economics jumped out to a six point lead before the Forest Fires
could get on the scoreboard. With the aide of some hot shooting from
Ron Sepic and some good board work from Rod Fedorchick. the "Fires"

«came storming "back. Both teams played a loose zone d_efense in.-the

first half and thellead changed hands with almost every bucket. At the

half-way mark. the Forest Fires held a slim 28-25 lead.
At tlhegstart, of theseclond half. the "Fires" Sepic literally caught

is even more -fierce. and five. net-
ters. Mike Pines. Bill Woods, Wal-
ly Ellman. Alan Levin, and Bill
Davis, will all be fighting for those
last two spots.

The doubles situation is even
more ‘uncertain than singles, as
the players have had very little

’ time to practice. Webster is for-

tunate in that most of his players
are evenly matched for doubles.

"The doubles could be inter-
changeable.” explained Webster._
"All of our "players are pretty
evenly matched this year. and
they haven’t played enough to
really know who‘s best with who."

Kantor will probably play with
Woods, and Dieffenbach and Cur-
rent. who played together last
year._ also will probably be to-
gether. The third double team
shapes up as Hurwitz and Pines.

“Everbody has improved’ over
last year,” stated Webster. “They
worked hard at it all winter and
are all better than they were at

a similar time last year.”

The problem is, so is the com-_t '
petition. "Duquesne has some

new faces and should be strong-
er." predicted \\ ebster. "\\ e beat
them 9-0 last year. but a lot of
the matches. could have gone

» either way. We don‘t have it so

easy this year.

"Tennis has grown so much re-
cently, that a lot of schools will
have outstanding freshmen com-
ing up who will be really tough."
he went on. "I wouldn‘t be’sur-
prised if every team we play has
at least two freshmen playing."

A good example of the rapid
growth of the sport is the avail-
ablility of the East Liberty in-
door courts. A few years ago, they
were beginning for people to play
there, but now, it’s impossible to
get in.

The netters will play a 14 game
schedule. and Penn State looms
as the toughest team on the card.
pitt home matches are held at the
courts behind Trees Hall. and
spectatorshave been scare in -re-
cent years. With the growing pop-
ularity of the sport. it i_s hoped
that this‘ situation will change.

Boyd at Oliver rle did every thing

Now that Boyd knows where he

10 minutes remaining in the half, Sepic and the Forest Fires had open-
ed up a 10 point lead. Economics switched to a man to man defense to
combat Sepic, and came storming back with Fran Beisler carrying
most of the scoring load and Jerry Bently controlling the boards.

Beisler popped a short turn-around" jumper with a minute remain-
ing to bring his team within two points of the lead. Carl Bell drove the
lane for a bucket to put the Forest Fires back on to by four. Economics
came down the court and turned the ball over, but Fedorchick was call-
ed for a technical and the “Fires” lead was again cut to two.

The Forest Fires Dick Wagner connected on half of a one and one

between Art Nakazato of Budhouse and Tom Bailey
of Phi Kappa Alpha in the 130 pound weight class.

This was in many ways the best match of the
evening. Going into the third period Baileywas
ahead, 4-3. The match was characterized by a se-
ries of takedowns and escapes and was a test of
Bailey’s strength against Nakazato’s stamina. With
