In the 40th renewal of the
traditional series, Pitt’s Gold-
en Panthers will‘ play host to
Penn»; State’s unpredictable
Lionmen tomorrow afternoon
in what should prbve to be the
hardest fought battle of the

series.
Regardless of whether oneteam

is far superior‘ to the other, or ,

whether one of the ballclubs can
put just ﬁve men on the ﬁeld, the
game’ is always close-. This year

neither team has much of an edge,

over the other on paper, and they

both have eleven good men to place

on the ‘field. A

‘ Pitt needs this ‘game to atone
for their early season failures,
while the gridders from Penn State
want the game‘ to avenge them-
selves of last year’s defeat.

The boys from Old Main came
down from the mountains of cen-
tral Pennsylvania last fall, seem-
ingly on the road to Pasadena, but
Pitt soon detoured them with a
20-7 loss.

Penn State lost all of last year’s
line, but have added a handful of
promising sophomibres to their var-
sity. Of course no one can deny
that their losing all-American Leon
Gajecki, and ends To'm Vargo,

’ and Lloyd Parsons hurt their pre-
season chances. But stillfeven with
these losses, Higgins can insert ca-
pable replacements.

Typical College Student Prefers “Life”,
According to Periodical Room Reports

f i By JEAN moms

There are twolines of thought
that outsider-s usually follow when
they think about college students.

Either they picture a rooter at
a football game, a barfly, a social
light, and someone weighted down
with fraternity pins, or they con-
yiure up a vision of a bespectacled

ones who go regularly to thelperi-
odical room, settle down in studious
quiet, and read~—Life, Esquire, and
the New Yorker, in just that order
of popularity. ,
Loudest and most frequent de-
mand: for magazines in the peri-
odical room are for the latest Life.

Not far behind are cries for Es-

quire and the New Yorker.

-In the case of the periodical
room, at least 95 percent of the
readers are men, whichimay ac-
count for Esq e and the ‘New

  
   
 

masculine tastes. ’

The reference room, too, has its
favorites, although they vary
monthly. 2

Each month, there is a “run” on
some particular group of books.
Last month it was Chaucer and
Wordsworth; this month it’s his-
tory books and all the early folk-
lore. Mrs. A. Earle’s folklore is
especially well read. Librarians in
the circulation department believe,
however, that these “runs” on dif-
ferent types of books are, caused
by special assignments rather than

most read novel. Reserve cards

still pile high for Eric Knight's
This Above All and For Whom the
Bells Toll by Hemingway. “With-
in the last few weeks there has also
been a sudden demand for Thomas
Wolfe novels,” says Mrs. Helen
Dice, librarian in the Alldred
room, “and of course stories about
doctors are always popular.”

, f In 1936 Herrymon Maurer grad-
uated from the University of Pitts-
: burgh.

"  As a student Maurer had taken
’a large; part in college activities.
Besides work on the publications
andin the dramatic society he held
L membership in Omicron Delta
* Kappa, Pi Tau Phi, Theta Alpha
‘Phi, and Quill club. He was far
:more advanced than the average
I college student in that he had made
_Wa private study in the ﬁelds of
U -English, philosophy, comparative
. literature, and comparative reli-

' work on the historyyof ideas. .

,After graduation he did some
advertising copy-work and ghost
_ writing. His articles have appear-

By MARTIN H. LUBOVSKY
Unfortunately there exists wide-

spread pessimism popularly and
even in ‘highly-educated circles as
’to the ability of local government
do to become divorced from dishonest
and semi-dishonest political prac-
' ltices or to emerge generally from
"the low station it now occupies.

We feel certain that the increas-
ingly greater number of outstand-
ing people graduating from the
government service courses in our
colleges will in time prove this

’ ‘pessimism unwarranted.

l_ Not only outright thievery, but
‘such practices as patronage and

the control of officials’ actions by
, one or a few heavy party contrib-

. utors are not necessary evils. This
is not a matter of having our cake
and eating it too. We can have
democratic government and at the
same time, clean, decent, moral
government.

Now if capable, trained college
Wgraduates assumed control of one
local party (and this is not beyond
. the realm of possibility), conduct-
ing the city, county, or state af-
fairs, with skill and honesty, they

But we wouldn’t work. Can’t /make

burgh again heard from Herry-
mon Maurer when his book “The
End Is Not Yet” appeared. In it
he had translated that desire to
know the earth’s peoples into a
concentrated study of the Chinese
people and the war.~ Subtitled
“China at War” the book differs
from the usual works on the war
in China in that it deals not with
battles and generals but with the
people themselves. '

Maurer was well able to write.

on the Chinese war, for he arrived

- in China in 1938 inthe midst of

an epic Chinese migration. Hos-
pitals and universities had been
moved with the people. The Uni-
versity of Nanking at which Maur-
er was a newly appointed profes-
sor of languages had been moved
to Chengtu in the province of
Szechwan.

Added to the general complica-
tions arising from the constant
bombing and the crumbling dwel-
ings was the situation of young
Mrs. Maurer and their newly born
child.- This constant aerial bom-

being rewarded with some job,we
would not have “puppets” for ex-
ecutives, and payrolls cluttered up
with petty, incapable politicians.

Though it may come with the
Democrats or even a third party,
we are inclined to feel that good
government will originate with the
Republican parties, dishonest and
reactionary as they have been.
This is simply because the GOP
politicos are the weakest today,
and conscientious Republicans will
have a less difficult time wresting
control from them.

Americans, discouraged by the
sad condition of local governments,
are, despite recent trends to the
contrary, almost as complacent as
the Chinese who don’t.even require
their oﬂicials to keep books, though
they know grafting is continually
going on. This is part of Confu-
cious’ philosophy‘ and without at-
tempting to be facetious, we might
say it results in considerable con-
fusion. It may succeed in keeping
the -Chinese ignorant and thus con-
tent, but it is hardly conducive to
good government. ‘ A

When government service men
demonstrate that good government
is a possibility in a few cities such
as Chicago, Philadelphia, Jersey
city and Pittsburgh, the people will
become aroused and the rest of
the nations will follow suit.

Even in times of great interna-
tional danger such as these, we
must not lose sight of the prob-
lems of democracy, since it is part-

No runnin’ water. No ‘toilets. Bank-

Herrymon Maurer Describes .

China's War, People, and Pain

of malaria prompted Maurer re-
luctantly to pack up and take the
clipper back to the United States.

Included among the ten pounds of
luggage allowed him by the air-
lines was the manuscript of his
book. '

Beginning with the Shanghai in-
cident which was the opening
chapter in Japan’s all-out struggle
to conquer the vast sprawling
landsof China, Maurer carefully
traces the course of the war and
its effect on. the people. He gives
an insight into‘ the psychology of
this people who, disunited, scatter-
ed, and given no chance whatso-
ever to survive against the onrush-
ing Japanese, have managed to re-

sist, not for days, or weeks, or ‘

even months, but for five years
and who grow stronger as time
goes on._ '

Actual contact 'with Japanese
warriors serve to strengthen rath-
er than‘ to weaken the Chinese.

“The most patriotic Chinese,” says
Maurer, “is the one who comes in
contact with the invader.”

The Chinese people are not re-
vengeful, points out Maurer.
Though they have ‘had the oppor-
tunity, they have refrained from
retaliation bombing.- There is also
a reluctance to place the blame for
what has and is happening on the
Japanese people.

Never maudlin, the book pre-
sents a keen, warm, and sympa-
thetic understanding of the Chin-
ese people. It is written in a lei-
surely facile manner and is ﬁnely
illustrated with bitsiof Chinese an-
ecdote and the pointed philoso-
phies of the Chinese philosopher
Lao-Tao. -

Herrymon Maurer looks for all

newer and ﬁner China to arise from
the smouldering ruins of the old.
His belief is that “in the history of
China tomorrow, the war of re-
sistance against Japan— however
symbolic of China’s inner and driv-
ing reality--is only an incident-—
for “the end is not yet.”

With all their greeting cliches
shined up and ready for use, Pitts-
burgh society turned out the other
night for the Oscar Levant con-
cert; turned out complete with too-
Btiﬂ“ collars and too-revealing de-
lcolletage. I

There were the usual sleeping
husbands being ,poked in their
well-padded ribs by the usual
pseudo-esthetic wives. There was
tolerant Fritz Reiner, more amused
than impressed by the rhythms of
Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue;”
and one must forget the super-
cilious musicians, grinning conde-
scendingly when the trumpeter got
“on the beam.”

Intermission brought them with
their Brenda Frazier bobs and their
sweeping skirts that got under
each other’s feet, into the smoke-
ﬁlled lobby. And the end of the
performance sent them scurrying
to their favorite private club and
us to the trolley-car stop.

We sat during the ride home be-
side two members of the orchestra
——-violinists. They spoke in cultur-
ed tones of this musician's inter-
pretation and that one's deliver-
.nCeu

For a few minutes they sat si-
lent, then one turned to the other:

“Say," he said, “ven iss Benny
Guudman comink to town?"

This has been a semester that
gives testimony to many of our
elders’ admonishments about the
lack of seriousness on the part of
college students today.

A few weeks ago it was stu-
dents at an eastern college who
requested that professor's lectures
be transmitted to dorms and fra-
ternity houses via radio, thus elim-
inating the necessity of attending
classes.

Recently there appeared in the
Gettysburgian, official student pub-
lication of Gettysburg college, an
editorial entitled “Regular Satur-
day Dances Can Happen Here!”

“Everybody is dissatisﬁed with
the present social set-up on thg
campus," mourned the editors.

Here is a suggested list of dances
which the student body brought up
for consideration by the adminis-
tration:

Small informal dances every Sat-
urday night, a BIG fall Military
ball on Friday night followed by
the usual fraternity pledge dances
Saturday night, the regular frater-
nity Christmas parties, a BIG mid-
winter Junior prom on Friday
night followed by the regular in-
formal Saturday affair. . . .

dance on Saturday night, the reg|l'

Ah, carefree youth.

By Norman Marcus and Herb Reingold

Here we go again . . . Overlooked
in the stream of new songs is the
beautifuly melodic “Who Shall I
Turn To,” excellently recorded by
Shep Field's new brassless band.
“Autumn Nocturne” on the re-
verse is a mediocre instrumental.
. . . Listen for the superb vocal on
Wayne King's “Darling How You
Lied.” “Jumpin’ Jupiter” is one
of those rare King swing specials.

On Bluebird this week, Freddie
Martin dishes up another “Con-
certo” in his arrangement of
“Symphony Moderne,” taken from
the theme of “Four Wives” and
played by John Garﬁeld. Discmate
“Anniversary Waltz" is a cut-dry
three-quarter time ditty for the
long hairs. . . . That nasal-toned
Tech troubador, Vaughan Monroe
waxes “Something New" (It's
about time) and “I Struck a
Match in the Dark.” (This ought
to throw a little light on the vocal
situation.) The band is in bad need
of a good male vocalist. . . . Ziggy
Elman’s ﬁne rendition of the tradi-
tional “Eli, Eli," spotlights more
superb trumpet work released on
records recently.

Tommy Dorsey (what control
that man has!) turns in a neat
smooth job of soloing on the Alex
Stordahl arrangement of “None
But the Lonely Heart” . . . Those
who like the Art Tatum style of
pianoing will want to hear Herman
Chittison’s ﬁngering of “Flamin-
go” and “The Man I Love.” . . .
Kay Kyser hits the Record Stack
this week with recordings of two
novelties from his movie “Play-
mates” namely “Humpty Dumpty
Heart” and “Romeo Smith and
Juliet Jones.”

For topflight arrangements, Les
Brown's ﬁne band scores again
with “Do You Care,” slighted by

Betty Bonney's vocal. Discmate is
the grand “Lament to Love." . . .
We see that classical urge crop-
ping up again in Jan Savitt’s re-
cent recordings. Following a two-
faced disc of “Afternoon of a
Faun," Savitt presses “In the Hall
of the Mountain King” and “Little
Fugue” (Apologies to Bach) . . .
Sammy Kaye predicts that “Hon-
eybunch” will be a top-notch tune,
but we like “This Is No Laughing
Matter” on the reverse as the tune
to achieve popular appeal.

By the way, listen for Sammy's
waxing of “The Shrine of St. Ce-
cilia.” . . . Those who appreciated
Raymond Paige's “Musical Ameri-
cana Album” will certainly want
to obtain his newest album which
includes such hits as “Stardust,”
“Donkey Serenade,” etc.

THINGS TO LOOK FORWARD
TO:

We just found out that Leighton
Noble has been signed to play the
Freshman dance on Dec. 5. For
some really sm-oo-th dancing we
suggest that you attend the first
big venture of the class of '45.

Be sure to listen for Claude
Thornhill on the Fitch Bandwagon
next Sunday. Here is America’s
Number one up-and-coming band.

MUSICAL COMMENTS:
Quite a few students who heard
Jimmy Dorsey this week did not
like his music. Master James is
strictly a commercial type of band
that appeals to juke-box lovers,
but seems not to make any head-
way with the college crowd.
SONG OF THE WEEK:
Thanks to Rachmaninoff, a new
song has arrived that is a sure bet
to reach the top. Taken from his
“Concerto in C Minor,” the number
titled “I Think of You,” is being
featured by Will Bradley and Tom-
my Dorsey. ’

a story or novel published. He.rry-

man Maurer’s (Pitt ’36) book on _
China has been reviewed in the 
Pitt News, the Pittsburgh Press 
and the Bulletin Index. This week 

a story by Freer Stalnaker, for-
mer student of Mr. Hunt, is pub-
lished in the November American
Mercury. Titled “The Victor,” the
story seems at ﬁrst glance to be
some kind of political allegory.

It is interesting, by the way, to
see how the Mercury has changed
since its hell-raising Mencken-Na-
than days. Edited by Eugene Ly-
ons it has now settled down to a
mild, more or less conventional
liberalism.

Outlines, 341 Boulevard of the

dent memberships include free ad-
mission to the gallery during ex-

hibits, rental rates of one-half the ;;;
usual charge for borrowing books 
or records, the same reductions 
that are allowed regular members 
on admissions to movies, lectures, ‘

etc., and reductions on articles
bought through the gallery.

A new exhibition at Outlines, 
including a display of functional 4

jewelry, is now open.

Short story writers on campus, 
and they seem to be legion, should ‘:-':

First prize is stupendous-—$500,

 Henri Temianka

  Will Be Solcst
A With Symphony

Henri Temianka, the new con-
certmaster o'f the Pittsburgh Sym-
phony orchestra, will make his de-
but as soloist under the baton of
Fritz Reiner tonight and this Sun-
day afternoon at the Syria Mosque.
He will play the Beethoven Violin
concerto.

In commemoration of the one-
hundredth anniversary of Dvorak’s
birth, Reiner has selected Dvorak's
“New World Symphony No. 5" as
the major orchestral work on the
program. The opening piece will
be the American Festival overture
by the American composer, Wil-
liam Schumann.

Henri Temianka calls himself a
“cosmo-Pole.” _ He was born in
Scotland of Polish parents, and was
educated in Holland and the Unit-
ed States.

Temianka was to resume his Eu-
ropean concert tour, but the pres.
ent situation forced him to cancel

 his engagements. After a success-

: ful tour in the West Coast, he re-
turned to New York to perform on
the concert stage and radio.
Among his performances was one

on “Alec Templeton Time.”

Esther says friends give most of

Modern Dance 'I'lheo1tY’
Explained by

Jane McLean, American concert
dancer and lecturer,“ visited Pitt,
Mt. Mercy, Carnegie Institute of
Technology, last Monday, Tuesday,
and Wednesday, and gave demon-

strations of her excellent technique

in moderndancing.

[A young artist of great promise,
Miss lMcLean, has been a profes-
sional dance student with Martha
Graham, foremost modern dancer
in the country, and is also a for-

Hospitalization
Enrollment
lncrcases,   «-

Hospitalization results showed a
marked increase in the number of
women who took out insurance this

‘ year. A total of 103 more subscrib-

ers were registered.

«Fromthe 128 who took out in-
surance the second semester of last
year, 19 made use of it._ These Pitt
women spent a total of 157 days in
the hospital, receiving service from
the ‘hospitalization association
amounting to $718.90.

For the ﬁrst time this year every
woman student not living at home
or with relatives was required by
the Woman's Health service to
either take out insurance or to
make some other arrangement so
that in case of illness she could be
immediately removed from the
house inlwhich she is ‘living. Only
two resident women made plans
other than hospitalization.

Student hospitalization is spon-
sored by the Pitt News and the
Student Health association. This
is the second yearthat the plan has
been presented to the students.

Final totals are expected this
week when results of the men’s
hospitalization campaign are_ re-
vealed.

Local football pep rallies and

victory parades sometimes rise to

great heights, but none of them can
compare to the one "held in Hous-
ton, Texas, last Saturday night.

Hundreds of Texas A&M col-
lege cadets, arriving for the Texas
Aggie-Rice institute football game,
held a midnight pep rally in down-
town Houston. The'cadets started
by blocking traffic and turned in
a fire alarm.

Nine ﬁretrucks from four sta-
tions roared into the mixup. Then
a police squad arrived and resorted
to teargas to break up the riot. This
was "effective for a time, but the
stubborn cadets soon returned to
continue their hullabaloo.

Finally the police chief left his
bed and joined the scene. He called
off the police and let the cadets
go on with their cheering, but told

them to obtain city council permis- ‘

sion for future rallies.‘

University of Chicago, as a treat
for homecoming alumni, lifted. its
intercollegiate football ban for 40
minutes last Saturday. The contest

Two years ago sophomore Edgar
Jones tossed a sixty yard pass that
won him fame and the ball game.
The newspapers, dusting of!’ an old
high school nickname, “Special De-
livery,” promptly took him to their
bosoms and then, just as promptly

. forgot about him. This year senior

Edgar “Special Delivery,” “Mail-
man,” “Jonesy, Old Boy,” “Scran-
ton Scrammer,” ALL—AMERICAN
Jones again became the darling of
the press as he gave them all some-
thing to remember him by through
a series of sparkling performances
against Ohio State, Fordham, and
Nebraska. Harold Davis, a Scran-
ton writer, is credited with tagging‘
the “Special Delivery” on Jones
while he was still in High School.
On campus, however, it is still
plain “Eddie" Jones. Jones is in-
clined to be modest about his tri-
umphs. “It was all our line" he

Pitt-Penn State games have al--
Ways been characterized by clean
sportsmanship which is one of the
reasons that these two schools have
met so often.

Pitt scouts who watched the
Lions in action all season seem to
fear their offensive attack. “Pep-
per" Petrella is used essentially as
a spot runner. All the State line
has tojdo is give him a chance to
get‘ started, then walk down the
field for the extra-point. Bill
Smaltz’s passing this year has im-
proved for he has been the spell’-
head of the air-minded State
J.-squad.

Critics seem to be of the opinion
that the Panther 'squad Wlll let
down this weekend. But, on the
(contrary, for they are looking'for-
{ward to this game just as much as
the Penn State players.

What the local fans should wor-
ry about is the physical condition
of the gridders, After playing sev-
en straight contests with as strong
opposition as the Panthermen
have, they are bound to be worn

‘ out.

Walter West, veteran quarter-
back, has not worked out with the
{team all week for he is on the in-
jured list ‘with a sore side. West
has been playing a bang-up ball
all season, and has usually been a
_60 minute man. It takes a power-
fully built boy with a strong side
to block out the enemy ends when
they come charging in towards the
ball carrier, and West, although
powerfully built, would have a def-
jnite handicap with his weak side.

Ralph Hammond took over the
signal calling post in the Nebraska
game, and played magniﬁcent ball.

All-American Edgar Jones is

an added incentive this weekend
because he is carrying a grudge

against the_.Staters, which should ;

make his ball playing as close to
perfect as one can get. Lack of a
good passing attack hampered the
Panthers last week, but with Jones
again throwing, Pitt is expected to
to partially air-minded.

Jack Durishan and Bill Beng-
hauser have been developing into
standout performers in the past
two games. Benghauser probably
played the ‘greatest game of his
career last Saturday against the
Huskers, and is apt toldo it again
tomorrow.

Durishan was hurt prior to the
Nebraska fracas and did not start
the contest. He has been g-oing
‘great guns in drills this week and
should start the game this week-

insists. “The were marvelous. All
I did was run." a
— A physical education major,
Jones would like to coach or teach
after graduation, though, of course,
the army has first call on him. He
has already received feelers from
some of the pro ball clubs but,
while he is not averse to playing
for pay, it will take a pretty good
offer to make him do it.
Fan mail and gifts began pour-
ing in after the Foirdham game.
Probably the most unique gift
he has received was the one given
him following the Nebraska game.
A Pittsburgh rooter approached
Jones after the game. “You’re
bringing home the bacon,” he said
“Why not take the whole hog?"
Whereupon he thrust a squirming
little porker into Jones’ arms. The
pig entertained the entire football
squad during the ride home by

war 74.» e.....:.., /Veecﬁ a Mme 44..-1......r

running up and down the aisles.
At present he (the pig) is quar-
tered at the stadium. In‘ fact, he
has already been adopted as an un-
official mascot by the team.

The biggest thrill of Jones’ col-
lege career, however, was last
year’s game against Penn State
which Pitt won 20 to 7 thus ruin-
ing State’—s undefeated record.
Jones gets a particular joy out of

"beating State for he has his own

personal grudge against them. It
seems that once upon a time all
arrangements were made for him
to attend that institution and then
something happened. Jones doesn't
like them and they don't like him.
Jones had nothing against Ford-
ham and Nebraska and look what
happened. He has something
against Penn State.

scene of former triumphs, for Hig-
gins had turned in brilliant per-
formances as end on the Nittany
Lion teams of 1914, 1915, 1916 and
1919. The breach was caused by
Higgins entrance into the army in
the fall of 1917. Even in the army

in the fall of 1919, Higgins was.

again elected captain of the foot-
ball eleven. His team defeated
Cornell, Penn, Pittsburgh, Buck-
nell, Lehigh, Gettysburg, and Ur-
sinus, losing only to Dartmouth.
He was named by Walter Camp on

the first All-American eleven that»

season.

The ﬁnal game he played for
Penn State against Pittsburgh has
become legendary in athletic his-
tory. In the ﬁrst quarter Pitt had
carried the ball to the State ﬁve
yard line and lost it on downs. Ex-
pecting a kick at this stage of the
game, the Panther backs closed in.
Instead, Harold Hess dropped back
of the goal line and passed to Hig-
gins, on the ﬁfteen, who ran the
remaining 85 yards for a touch-
down which took the heart out of

He returned to Wesleyan in 1922

it was a disheartening experience
for a new coach who could never

State Sports Scribe Describes
Nittany Lion Football Games

By BOB SCHOOLEY.
Penn State, Daily Collegiate

Faced with the problem of re-
building the entire forward wall

this season, Coach Bob Higgin’s
gridders have gained valuable ex-
perience as the season progresses.
Penn State’s line, composed of
mostly sophomores and juniors,
has developed into a formidable
combination.

In‘ the first game of the season,
the Nittany Lions entered the bat-
tle with Colgate’s eleven. The Red
Raiders were favored over the
Lions, but Coach Higgins’ men
fought on even terms until Coach
Andy Ke.rr’s reserve backﬁeld pow-
er ﬁnally subdued the Lions in the

» fourth quarter. Penn State’s grid-

men reached a peak of high spirit-
ed play and displayed ﬁne blocking
and tackling. The green line was
given its first test when Colgate
drove to the one-foot mark. With
four downs to make one foot, the
Lions braced and performed as vet-
erans, but yielded to a score on the
last down. The famous Bill Smaltz-
to-Len Krouse passing combina-
tion did not get started too well,
but the boys played exceptionally
good ball.

The Nittany Lions’ home opener
was one of the most thrilling. Buck-
nell's Bisons invaded the State col-
lege gridiron and rung up two
touchdowns against the Nittany
Lions before the game was two
minutes old. The first score came
on a pass from Co-Captain Mel
Knupp to Al. Magagna for 21
yards. A‘Penn State fumble, an-
other pass from Knupp to Magag-
ne, another touchdown.

Two blocked kicks paved the way
to two scores for the Nittany Lions.
Spending a greatvdeal of time on
practicing blocking kicks, Coach
Higgins’ men applied that knowl-
edge. Before the ﬁrst quarter was
over, Ken Schoonover, tackle,
crashed through the Bison line to

block a kick. Wilbur Van Lenten,‘

end, chased the ball, scooped it up
and ran almost to the goal ‘line.
Pepper Petrella did the‘ rest,‘ scor-
ing over right tackle,,Smaltz, the
gentleman with the educated‘, toe,
split the goal posts with the sev-
enth point. A few minutes after
the second quarter began Van Len-
ten blocked a kick and Schoonover
fell on it. Petrella again sliced
through for a touchdown and
Smaltz added the extra point.

Not desiring to detract from the
ability of Andy Tomasic and Com-
pany, Coach Higgins and his
charges declare that the Temple
Owls outplayed the Nittanymen in
all departments, winning 14-0. Per-
haps the turning point in the game
for the Lions came when the ﬁrst
quarter was only a few minutes
old. Bill Smaltz, talented passer
and punter, was injured. From
there on the Lions seemed to play

 listless ball. P.e,1>1»ér::E‘.etrella».s,lnoul-

 

,dered the .burden of most of the

ball carrying. Jack Banbury, re-
serve fullback, was particularly ef-

fective against the Owl forward
wall, but he was unable to break

away for any sizeable gains. John
Jaffurs, guard, was also lost to the
Nittanymen by an injury. Thus
disheartened, the Penn State grid-
ders were pushed at will. ‘

Against Lehigh and New York
university it was a comparatively

93315? for the Lions to come up with

Graduation Wrecks A E Seniors Win Circuit Crown;

Entire State Line

Pitt’s annual battle with Penn
State this year ﬁnds them facing
a team that is not as strong as last
season’s State eleven, but a team
that will be in there for sixty min-
utes giving there all for a victory.

Flanking State’s very weak line
are ends Wilbur Van Lenten and
John Potsklan, a. junior and a soph-
omore. Neither of these boys have

had much expe-

rience, in "
the entire
tany line is

ed or
drafted.

At the tackles, Bob Higgins has
a converted center, Mike Kerns,
and Ken Schoonover, two juniors.
Kerns is a varsity wrestler, and
weighs about 220. Schoonover
6-2, and goes about 195.

Both guards, Donald “Red" Yo-

, he and Bob Perugini, are light in
comparison to most guards, and

have had very little experience.
Neither weighs over 180 pounds.

Last year Leon Gajecki was all-
American center for State, and was
a sixty minute man throughout‘ the
season. Thus, none of the reserve
centers had any actual playing
time. Bob Wear, 200 pound senior;
will probably draw the starting as-
signment. «

Last . year Smaltz, Krouse, and
Petrella were the players who gave
the Panthers a headache, with Pe-
trella in particular proving himself
troublesome. He was off on long
dashes, time after time, and tried
valiantly to stave off defeat. Pep-
per is next to the smallest man on
the State squad, standing only 5

WEAVER

feet 8 inches, and weighing only
160 pounds.

Captain Len Krouse and Ralph
Ventresco will hold down the half-
back spots. Krouse was State’s
leading scorer last year and is hav-
ing another good year. He’s a.
senior, stands an even» six feet, and
weighs 175 pounds.

Junior P a u l
Weaver under
studied John Pat
rick last year
and will be at
the‘ quarterback :i
post tomorrow
He’s a six footer,
weighing 2 1 5
pounds, and is
one of the few
experienced play- A '
ers in the squad. PETRELLA

Ventresco alternates with John
“Pepper” Petrella at the tailback
position. Ventresco is a junior and
is rated to be "a fast man, while
“Pepper” is held for spot running.

An oddity about the State team
is the presence of a player who
stands only 5-5, and weighs only
145 pounds. He is Billy Mazzocco,
a junior from Pittsburgh, who
plays at left half.

Outstanding man on the squad
is fullback Bill Smaltz, who is not-
ed for his passing and kicking. He
isn't rated as a fast runner, but is
good at cracking the line.

Thus Pitt will be facing a team
with a good backﬁeld, but a team
that has a very weak line; a line
that has handicapped the back-
ﬁeld this season. The backﬁeld
men are the only ones who have
had any experience previous to
this year.‘ On the basis of this, a
Pitt win over the ‘Nittany lion is
not improbable.

Phi Eps Cop l-F Championship

By EARLSURLOFF and DAVE mqnv
The fraternity and engineering

touch football kings were crowned
last Tuesday and Wednesday, with
Phi Epsilon Pi and the AE&ME
seniorsbeing the winners of those
championships.

The Phi Eps tripped the PiKA’s
in the Greek ﬁnale, 12-6, to bring

‘the‘ fraternity championship to

their house for the first time in
Phi Ep history at Pitt.

Freshman “Piggy” Dutch, who
has starred all season for the Phi
Eps, passed to Bob Goleman soon
after the game got underway, giv-
ing the new fraternity champs’ a
six-point lead, which they never
gave up.

In the second half Jimmy Deu-
telbaum was on the receiving end
of a pass from Dutch to give the
Phi Eps their ﬁnal touchdown of
the game. After that play the Phi
Eps were content to play a de-
fensive game, as they protected
their 12 point advantage.

With the time running _out,
PiKA_ took to throwing long, des-
perate passes in an effort to cap-
ture the crown that was slowly
moving out of their reach. One of
these long passes from Carlson to
Ralph Wilde found its mark, and
gave the losers their only score of
the game. ,

The Phi Ep attack, defensively
as well as offensively, was center-
ed around ﬁve players. Phil Dutch,
Bob Goleman, Jim Deutelbaum,

Bob Bronk, and Hal Weissman.-

The victory gave the Phi Eps the
right to meet the AE&ME seniors,
the rec:-owned engineering cham-
plons.

The AE&ME seniors retained
the engineering league title by
beating the AE&ME fresh’ and
sophs, 12-6, in a bitterly fought
battle.

The game started out as a rout

for the seniors, as they scored soon
after the opening kickoff, but their
attack soon bogged down. The
touchdown came on a pass from
“Bulgy Dave” Mamaux, star of the
seniors, to Gerbore. ;

After that, the game became a

series of arguments with the ref- .

eree, and hot words ﬂew from both
sides.

The second half found Mamaux
ﬁnding the range again, and this

time Yates caught his long pa”’ss,-

to sink the frosh and sophs. _

_. Midway in the second half the
fresh and sophs ﬁnally scored, as
Bill “Irish” O_’Connell passed to
Hohos. The rest of the game saw
the seniors playing a watchful,
cautious game, while the frosh and
sophs took chances on every play,
for they desperately tried to tie
the score or go ahead.

However, the senior defense was
good enough to stymie the des-
perate attack, and thus the AE&
ME seniors are the engineering
league champions for" the second
consecutive season.

In the independent loop, the un-
beaten, unscored upon Punks, roll-
ed over the Oilers, 47-0, as they
reached the ﬁnal of the circuit. The
Punks took a lot of time to get
started as they led‘by only seven

‘ points atthe half. However, they

quickly warmed up as the second
period got underway, and scored
40 more points.
