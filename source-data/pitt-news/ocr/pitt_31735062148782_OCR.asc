Retiring SFA
Assembly Kills
‘Ptirity’ Motion

Z653

Move for Committee
Election of Officers’
Fails by Four Votes’

A, brand new Student-Faculty
Association assembly took office
’l‘uesday night but not before the
retiring assembly had succeeded
in killing a constitutional amend-
ment designed to “take caucus
politics out of the election of SFA
ofﬁcers.” A

The amendment, introduced into
the assembly two months ago by
vice president Jack Hoeveler, C40,
and providing for the election of the
ofﬁcers by the executive committee
instead of by the assembly, fell
sh_o1‘t of the necessary two-thirds
vote, 12-7. _.

Vofng against the plan were Rae
‘S-‘mug, BA41, Phi Delta Theta;
Nancy Digby, C40, Kappa Kappa
Gamma; Gene Pyle, C41, Kappa
Kappa Gamma; Joe Roberts, BA4l,
Phi Gamma Delta; Mary Lewis,
C41, Kappa Alpha Theta; Dave
Buente, C41, Delta Tau Delta; and
~Dorothy Ann Carrier, C41, Inde-
pendent.

A surprise of the evening was the
opposition of Young and Miss Digby,
both of whom declared‘ themselves
in favor of the amendment as mem-
bers of the study committee, but re-

SFA Committees ii

Petitions for membership on all
SFA standing committees during
1940-41 are now available in the
offices of the deans of men and

manship should include with his
petition a note setting forth his

versed their stand when the ques-
tion, came to a vote on the floor of
the assembly.

Referred to a special committee
for study after its initial success be-
fore the assembly, the amendment
met with supposedly unanimous ap-
proval. The committee was com-
posed of Young, Miss Digby, Theo-
dore Biddle, assistant to the dean
of men, Hoeveler, and Bill McE1-
Wain, C41.

When the last regularly sched-
uled meeting of the old assembly
failed to produce a quorum, the
ﬁnal decision was carried over un-

til Tuesday, but with election of’

officers an immediate problem, the
amendment ran into unexpected
difficulties.

Chief objection to the amend-
ment, as re-introduced by Hoeveler,
was voiced by Roberts and Miss
Pyle, who declared that the new as-
sembly, affected most by the change,
would have no opportunity to de-
cide on its merits.

Immediately following the defeat
of the proposal, elections were held
and the meeting was turned over to
the new officers. At this point most

Hospitalization Gains Support

SFA Assembly, News, Campus Leaders Boost Move

As the undergraduate hospitaliza-
tion drive moved into its third day
on campus this morning, student
organizations and spokesmen con-
tinued to swing into line behind.
the movement.

Just ten hours before the ﬁrst
guns in the drive sounded Wednes-
day morning, the newly-elected
Student-Faculty’ Association went
on record in wholehearted support
of the undertaking.

A resolution-—-unanimousl.y en-
dorsed by SFA as the ﬁrst business
of the assembly under the gavel of
Joe Roberts, BA41—declared:

“Student-Faculty Association-—
realizing the aims and objectives of
the group hospitalization plan—
heartily endorses this far-sighted
undertaking and recommends it
highly to every member of the stu-
dent body. To the Pitt News and

the Student Health Service, co-
sponsors of the plan, we extend our
united support and we congratulate
them upon this meritorious service
to the University.”

Wednesday’s opening of a ground
floor booth provided the ﬁrst op-
portunity to gauge student interest
in the insurance plan and, accord-
ing to Ruggero Aldisert, C41, editor
of the Pitt News, student response

to the plan was far above the most
optimistic expectations.

Said Aldisert:

“Student: response to the group
insurance plan has been more fa-
vorable than any of us expected. It
has been very encouraging to all of
us who have been working on the
drive.”

Adding its support to the under-
taking, the entire staff of the Pitt

Spring Review
Climaxes Year

Of ROTC Drill

A year of training and drill for
ROTC cadets will be climaxed at 1

o’clock Monday in the Pitt Stadium ,

with the annual revew and inspec-
tion of the corps.

A regimental review of the Band
and the Corps will be followed by

an inspection to ‘be conducted by

Major Clifford D. Hindle, designat-

_ ed by the Corps Area Commander,

Commander General of the Third
Corps area, as instructor of the
Coast Artillery units of Western
Pennsylvania.

The new close order drill, adopt-
ed September 1, 1939 by the armed
forces of the United States, aimed
at more rapid development of troops
in combat, will be used in this re-
view.

The presentation of a sabre to the
outstanding cadet in the senior class
by the Veterans of Foreign Wars
a.nd the presentation of other honor
awards will be features of the re-
view. The University’s ROTC Reg-
iment holds the rating of an ex-
cellent drill unit which entitles each
cadet to the gold sleeve star. Per-
formance at *','e inspection deter-
mines retention of the star.

The public and general student
body is invited to attend the in-
spection. In case of inclement
weather the review will be post-
poned until Monday, May 27.

their present curriculum will be is-
sued during the week of May 20.

Dr. Weber’s announcement said:

Beginning in September, 1940,
certain laboratory fees will be
charged and adjustments will be
made in the tuition rates of After-
noon, Evening and Saturday stu-
dents. These changes do not apply
to students now enrolled in the
University.

In order that students now 811-
rolled may not be aﬁected, special
cards exempting them from these
changes while they are pursuing‘
their present courses of study will
be issued during the week of May
20.

It will be appreciated if the stu-
dents will cooperate in the distri-
bution of these exemption cards by
calling for them in accord with
the following schedule:

Changes in laboratory fees, as re-
ported by G. Stanley Rupp, assist-
ant treasurer of the University, in-
cluded:

A laboratory fee of $7.50 course
per semester will be paid by en-
rolling students for courses in
chemistry, physics, biology and
ceramics.

Fees per course per semester in
geology and psychology wil1,be $5.

Incoming freshmen in the School
of Engineering taking chemistry
must pay the same fee as charged
for those enrolled in other schools.
A fifteen dollar per year laboratory
fee will be charged for the remain-
ing years.

The regular tuition fee of $10 per
credit will affect all newly enrolled
Afternoon, Evening and Saturday
students, instead of nine dollars for
the third and every additional cred-
it under the present system.

A matriculation fee of $5 will al-
so go into effect in September, re-
veals Mr. Rupp. Students now en-
rolled, however, are exempt from
this fee.

The added fees are intended to
increase the revenues, explains
Rupp, to improve the laboratories.
Matriculation fees will help to bear
the expense of evaluation of cre--
dentials.

Rupp declares that all present en-
rolled students need only to present
their exemption cards to the cashier
at registration and no additional
fees will be required.

Law Library Includes Braille Texts

By Betty Schoeller
Among the many services which

the University offers to its students
and to the general public is the
School of Law’s eighteen shelves of
braille law books for the use of
blind students.

Although the books have not been
extensively used up to this time,
Dr. Francis J. Putman, professor
of law and chairman of the library
committee, pointed out that since
the books are essential law student
texts, they might be of use to any
blind person taking courses in
which the subjects of partnership,
corporation, simple case histories,
or personal property are discussed.

The distribution. of braille law
books throughout the country has
been a project of the Library of
Congress for the last few years. The
plan was first to build up collec-

tions in each of the ten circuit court
districts. The University of Penn-
sylvania at Philadelphia was the
first school in the state to be put on
the list. However, the project was
expanded and last year included
the University.

Dr. Putman admitted that the
University was at ﬁrst reluctant to
accept the donation, considering
that the space the books would take
would far exceed the demand for
them. He explained that the eight-
een shelves of books, it printed in
regular type, would ﬁll only one
shelf.

They did accept, nevertheless, and
every three months a new set of
plain white, thick papered, volumes,
covered with thousands of minute
round embossed dots is stored in
the far corner of the law library for
the use of some blind student who
seeks to study law.

The old SEA Set Good
Standards for the New

A good SFA (‘X(:"L‘lll"l\'€‘ coinniittee and an SFA asseiiibly retired
this week.

The record of the €).'{f.‘(.‘llll\'9 conmiittee is said to be the best
for a number of years. ‘They are credited with the initiation of a.
number of projects. wliicli were not only 1lOlGWOI‘il]_\' ideas but which
were also adniinistered Sll£'(.‘€SSf11ll_'\'.

Among their an-colnplislinients was the assigning of coinniittee
chairinanships to lneinbers of the assembl_v rather than the student
body at large. 'l"l1is at least forced the campus big names, com-
prising the aSS€‘ll'll)l_\," ineinbersl1ip——handpicked by fraternity and
independent leaders for SFA slates because of their records in other
act.ivities——to give some of their time to student g'overnn1en‘t.

Although ne:«:t year's assembly was chosen by the same fra-
ternity and independent leaders, it should realize that to all in-
tents and purposes it represents the interests of the entire un-
dergraduate student body at Pitt.

The new assembly ineinbers must keep in mind that they now
comprise what is supposed to be the Pitt student legislature——not
another honorary activities fraternity. VVork is expected from them.

This year ’s executive comniittee has set a record for the new
committee to equal if not to better. The new asseniblynien asked to
be considered for their positions and beggell students to vote thein in.
"l‘hey"ve got their chance. ‘Ne wait to see what tlley can do.

l The collective “we” got tog‘etl1er last Monrlay to decide what
the News should-say, editorially, about the present trend of the
European war. ‘We tried to determine what would be tl1e best
policy for the United States. Naturally, we received diverse opin-
-ions: give the Allies economic aid, stay out, help with planes, send
troops, and support G-erniaiiy. In short, we don’t. know what the
§S1;ates should do. Nor do we feel that we are qualiﬁed to volun-
.teer a student policy. _
However, wo dovfeel that comment is both justiﬁed and ne-
_‘ oessary. For we are the war generation.

To buttress our connnent, which will run in subseq1:I_en.t issues,
we invite the opinions of both student and faculty nieinbers on
“fOur Relationship to the European Conflict.”

S Vile are not doing this to duck the issue. \Ve are frankly and
simply unable to resolve any logical platform for American con-
iduct. Honesty coinpels us to keep mum until we hear from you.

1 ~ ‘Spring M isery’-Pitts Friend
Hamilton into a Complete F og

By Bob Hamilton.
This is a song of sorrow. Every year at this time znost people be-
come victims of an ill which a backwoods friend of ours once described
as “Spring misery.” This consists of ageneral mental disintegration ac-
companied by much physical languor,’ lassitude, and loopiness. The
awful example pointed out by the doctors interested in this phenomenon
is us, that is to -say, yours truly. U V
We are especially subject to the disease because an apt description
of useven while the invigorating winds of winter blowi would probably
"embody the terms given above in describing the symptoms of this plague.
We simply intensify, condense-,‘as it were, in the spring.
V H f.Chieﬂ'y, in our case, the disease takes the form of absent-mindedness.
We wander through the ivied halls of dear old Pitt looking externally
,as_ Acompos mentis as we usually do, but actually we are just drifting
along, barely existing. As a friend of ours, who is also subject to the

germ, put it the other day, whilehwe were ambling along together, “Two
. minds without a single thought.”

and one-half ticks late for that important class. ‘

‘ﬁDri*vei’ Gets Showed Downtown

But the worst is yet to come. Over the week-end we went down-
town to a department store to get something, and since the place was
crowded, we got shoved into a corner to await patiently our turn. After
some minutes of deep thought on this and t.hat-—a make-shift to pass the
time-—-we caught sight of a vaguely familiar person looking at us out of
the corner of his eye some distance away. Spring misery set in, and we
were darned if we could remember his nanie. In fact, after some nio-
ments of contemplation we weren‘t sure if we really knew the fellow,
or had merely seen him somewhere before. He didn’t look like the kind
of person we would associate with.

Wel.l, for about ten minutes, the pair of us eyed each other covertly,
while we racked our brains to discover his name and where we had seen
him before. Finally it got so embarrassing‘ we decided to brazen  out,
and, "taking a deep breath, we strode up to him.

Then we knew the climax of ﬁfteen years of absent-mindedness had

"come. ‘It was us’! We had been looking in a mirror.

Kalwary Pours ‘Weak Tea’
For FDR, FFP, FBI, etc.

By Kal Kalwary
In 1936 Florence Fisher Parry
was tired of a good looking, smiling
president . . She wanted a corn-
fed, businessman . . Landon .
Four years later, and the “Great
Smile” has Flo near prostration
This time she wants a Rover
Boy with a Hitler mustache

Dewey She says that men of
destiny these days all
have upper-lip dirt Charley

Coughlin won’t like that! . . .
They tell me that even the Repub-
licans are disgusted with Pennsyl-
vania’s bird-brain governor .
He’s determined to balance the
budget or have you bust!

The FBI Is Awaited

The efficiency of Mr. T. E. Tran-
seau’s Highway Safety department
is amazing and exasperating at the
time . . A friend of mine was in-
volved in an automobile collision
. . According to regulation, he
dutifully reported the accident to
Mr. Transeau . . About ten days
later the Highway Safety depart-
ment requested that my friend pre-
pare a report of the accident
A good citizen, my friend again
made a detailed report . . . A
week elapsed, and once again he
heard from the Highway Safety de-
partment , They wanted . . .
you’re allowed one guess . . .
a report of the accident.

Section 1214 of the Vehicle Code
provides that the operator of any
motor vehicle involved in an,acci-
dent resulting in injuries or death
to any person or total property

damage to an apparent extent of
fifty dollars, or more, shall forward
a report of such accident to the
Highway Safetty department .
This he has done twice . . He is
now bewilderedly awaiting an in-
vestigation by the FBI.

Mr. Roosevelt hates war
Eleanor hates war . Sisty and
Buzzie hate war But Frank-
lin Delano, by his Pan-American
speech, is asking for it He
would_,have ___us defend _“_democ-
racy”  foreign soil, it appears

. Well, I am of the ﬁrm belief
that we have no logical right to
ﬁght until we have organized and
mastered a form of democracy here

. Then, and only then, will we
be in a position to crusade
And the hell with American in-
terests in _Europe!

Sokolsky Attacks .

George Sokolsky, a ' gentleman of
letters whocarries the torch for the
Hearst syndicate, has written:
“Children can be taught that life is
hard-boiled, materialistic, selfish.
Children can be madexto believe
that nothing moves them but money”

But is that what you want
your children taught? ». . He at-
tacked Professorql-Iarold Rugg, in
the sly, inimitable manner" of his
ilk He attacked all truthful,
progressive teaching . . And So-
kolsky’s piece pricked the Dies
committee to attention Dies
and his vigilantes are going to in-
vestigate textbooks and professors

Education is to be given a
VVassermann . . . And did you ﬁnd
a job yet?

Protests Using Lawn

For Picnic Ground
Editor, the Pitt News:

I'like, as much ‘as any one, sit-
ting on the lawn outside the ca-
thedral; even to eating my lunch
there. ' But it seems a shame that a
few students have to come out, eat
their lunch». and leave their sand-
wich papers, milk bottles, plates and
soda glasses scattered over thegrass
when they are done eating, when it
is such a short distance to the Tuck
Shop and the nearest waste basket.
If this sort of thing keeps up I
would not at all be surprised if our
Bill Daufenbaugh and his marshals
should have to start chasing every-
body off the lawn. '

Let’s get together, gang, and carry
our plates and things back where
they belong. The campus would
look funny with “Keep off the
grass” and “Dump no rubbish” signs
all around.

bill, and, as one student who be-
lieves that adequate hospital atten-
tion prevents manycomplications.
I wish to commend both the Pitt
News and Dr. Carlson in their joint
promotion of group hospitalization
for University.

Because I happen to be too old
to be considered a dependent under
the hospitalization plan in which my
father isenrolled, I find myself un-
der no protection in case of the un-
expected. Students generally are
in this positlonand are appreciative
of the sponsorship of just such a
plan for hospital care on,/tlie Uni-
versity campus. ‘ ~

Until the Pitt News.p,_icked up this
plan and explained its workings to
the students, very few of them real-
ized the burden that would be thrust
on their parents by a sudden hos-

. pital expense when they are already

over-loaded with tuition and living
costs.  1

Your sponsorship has brought the
problem to the front.in.th,e. minds
of each student. For this, you cer-
tainly deserve credit.

In promoting this plan, you do an
excellent job of serving student in-
terests and concerns at the Univer-

Daily it presents a harmonious med-

Sammies Clash Witli Pi Lame
F or Top Spot in IE‘ Mushball

Sigma Alpha Mu clashes with Pi
Lambda Phi today in the most im-
portant contest of the I-F mushball
season at 4 o’clock on Field 1.

The undefeated Sammies have a
one game lead over the Pi Lams,
who suffered their only reverse at
the hands of the dangerous Sigma
Chi nine. If Pi Lambda Phi cops
the tilt, they automatically go into
a tie for ﬁrst place with the SAMS;
if not, Sigma Alpha Mu retains
ownership of first place.

All year Lou Mendlow, SAM big
gun, and Bert Jaffe, Pi Lam hope,
have been the instrumental forces
in their teams’ drives to the front
ranks.

Mendlow has pitched a no hit

game and several one hit games-

this season while Jarfe, although
not hurling a no-hitter has set
three ballclubs down with two hits.

Hack White, Mes Kaplan, and Joe
Aaron have been playing standout

Bonelli Moves

Back to Third

Two changes will be made in the
lineup of the Pitt nine that takes the
field against Navy tomorrow at An-
napolis.

For the second time this season,
Ernie Bonelli will start at third
base with either Vaiksnor, Haluska,
I-iatz, or Holbrook taking over the
keystone duties. ’

Pitt will be the slight favorite
with Ben Kish, speedball artist
and the only Panther ﬂinger to win
a game,‘ on the mound. Receiving
his deliveries will be efficient Guy
Guadagnino.

Ralph Fife will start at the initial

' sack again and Bob Foliart will con-
A tinue at shortstop.

The outﬁeld will be patrolled by
the same trio which has guarded it
throughout most of the season. Foot-
baller Edgar Jones will be at his
old stand at right ﬁeld and Al Bush
will patrol the mid—ﬁeld sector.

A Frank Goeltz will retain his spot in
left field.

University Will Continue Big Tinne
Humanities Curriculum

Committee Approves
Plans Despite Small

Enrollment Last Year

The year-old humanities curricu-
lum will be continued next semes-
ter despite small enrollment and
apparent lack of understanding of
the program’s details during regis-
tration last September.

Because of the lapse of time be-
fore high school students and their
advisers could fully understand the
plan, this new curriculum did not
receive the expected support of reg-
istering freshmen.

Plans for continuing the humani-
ties program have been approved,
according to a statement from the
College oﬁice and from Dr. John J.
Geise, associate professor of his-
tory an.d chairman of the faculty
committee which oversees the hu-
manities curriculum.

The humanities curriculum,
which can be entered only by in-
coming freshmen, offers a four-
year‘ program in humanities, de-
ﬁned as man’s effort to understand
himself and his relation to his fel-
low men and to the World in which
he lives.

Although natural and social sci-
ences are not overlooked, the chief
concern of the humanities students
is the transmission of man’s ﬁnd-
ings through languages, literature,
music and general ﬁne arts ﬁelds.

The ﬁrst year is conﬁned to
general background subjects and
the formulation of a concept of the
curriculum to be followed.

Sophomore studies center about
literature, art, history, and philoso-
phy of the old civilizations of the
Mediterranean regions.

Philosophy of England and the
continental countries provide a
background for an understanding
of the present world situation.

The senior year is devoted to var-
ious phases of contemporary life.

With the background of the ﬁrst
three years of the curriculum, stu-
dents will be able to understand
the signiﬁcance of present—day
events and view this contemporary
life not only for its own interest but
as a background for the future, ac-
cording to Dr. Geise.

SF A Meeting

Continued from page one

of the old members who had both-
ered to attend the meeting walked
out.

Most important of the new busi-
ness taken up was the decision to
create a special committee to study
the constitution over the summer
and propose possible revisions.
Suggestion of such a committee was
advanced by Dr. Vincent Lanfear,
dean of men, on the grounds that
“there are a number of things
about the constitution which should
be changed and they might as well
all be done at once.”

Dr. Lanfear further recommended
that the committee meet with the
outgoing executive committee for
suggestions and help.

It was decided that the new com-
mittee will be chosen this spring
at the same time as the standing
committees.

to open this year’s SFA activity.
Said Roberts: “SFA is behind the

plan are obvious.”

Said Dick Cassiano, C40, presi-
dent of Omicron Delta Kappa and
“outstanding senior man:”

“I know a number of instances
when students have needed just
such a plan of hospital insurance as
this. If it would have been availa-

for it one hundred per cent.”

TEST PILOT HOMER BERRY SAYS:
“No fast burning for me in my cigarette. I’ve smoked

"FASTEST PLANE off the production line
today!” That’s how Home: Berry describes
the amazing new Bell Airacobra. This vet-
eran test pilot started ﬂying in 1913 . . .
started smoking Camels the same year. "No
other cigarette ever gave me anything like
the pleasure of a Camel,” he says. “They
burn slower, smoke milder and cooler. In
26 years, that slower burning has given me
a lot of extra smoking.” Try Camels. Enjoy
Came1’s slower-burning costlier tobaccos.
Penny for penny your best cigarette buy!

 

In recent laboratory tests,
CAMELS burned 25%
slower than the average of
the 15 other of the largest-
selling brands tested -
slower than any of them.
That means, on the average,
a smoking plus equal to
