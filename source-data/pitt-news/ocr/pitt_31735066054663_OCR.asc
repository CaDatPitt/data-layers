say cheap labor
is weakening Pih‘

The number of full—time professors is drop-
ping, and some graduate students say under-
grads being taught by part—time faculty are not
getting the full beneﬁt of the University.

These spokespersons for the Campaign to
Organize Graduate Students [COGS] say the
large number of part—time teachers is an attempt

by Pitt to keep its workers in low—paying and

insecure jobs.
“lhis is something happening in a lot of

“schools,” said COGS spokesperson Jennifer

Cotter, of the English department. ‘There is a
decrease in full—tirne jobs and an increase in
part—time jobs. They’re hiring TAs to fulﬁll the
positions of a PhD., only at a much lower
wage.”

COGS spokesperson Barbara White, also

-of the English department, said that a graduate

student union would help preserve some of
those tenure jobs and give undergraduates a
more solid education.

“We want to restore the full—time job mar-
ket,” she said. “We want to restore education,
and make it more accessible, more affordable
for all students. At the same time we’re trying to
improve our conditions, so we can get through
our programs and have access to full-time jobs.”

White said that once a tenured faculty
member retires, the position is often ﬁlled with
what is known as an “adjunct lecturer,” or part-'
time professor.

‘These adjuncts get a contract for one year
or three years, and the pay is low, the beneﬁts are
low, and you don’t have access to tenure,”
White said. .

COGS spokesperson Frank Joseph, of the
communications department, said adjunct pro-
fessors and graduate student employees are
being exploited by Pitt.

“They’re an extremely cheap way of pay-
ing for labor, and the University is relying more
and more on that as Pitt becomes corporatized,”
Joseph said. '

But White stressed that the union campaign
is not‘ pitting the different types of teachers
against each other.

“Our idea is not that the part-timers are tak—
ing our jobs,” she said. “The issue is that Pitt is

Beginning at life together. Marriage and
a new baby. A white picket fence, a dog
maybe?

Or possibly, a life together living within
the residence hall with 640 college neigh-
bors, screams from the Pitt stadium, and
rowdy fraternity parties.

Who would chose this more—challeng—
ing environment? A caroer—oriented woman,
a newlywed, and a mother.

For Kishma DeCastro-Sallis, a St.
Thomas Virgin Islands native, working in the
University environment helping people, is
where she wants to be.

important as well, only taking three weeks of
family-medical leave after the birth of her
son, Torin, on Oct. 8.

“My mother was very supportive. She
was an advocate for women’s success, but it
was hard for her to see her only child leave
home.” DeCastro—Sallis left her home in the
Virgin Islands after high school to study out-
side of her country. She wanted to travel and
see the world. She came to Pittsburgh and
majored in clinical psychology with a con-
centration on youth and families. It was dur-
ing her college years that she met the man
who would become her best friend, and later,
her husband.

“I was a cheerleader, can you believe
that? And he was a basketball player for
Geneva College. We met though a mutual
friend,” said DeCastro-
Sallis, not the image of

ance, but even more stereotypically bouncy,
importantly, the giddy cheerleader.

D e C a s t r o -
Sallis, however, has
a reputation for not sharing her deep dark
secrets with the world She likes to keep to
herself. She said that she was raised to be
careful about whom one should call a friend

“I can be very social, but other times I
can be in a room and you don’t even know
I’m there. That’s just my personality,” said
DeCastro—Sallis.

Members within her staﬁ at Sutherland
Hall acknowledge her reputation but respect
her privacy. '

One staff member commented,
“Nobody knows her business. She is super-
private.”

And Chad Altoff, a senior resident assis-
tant of her staff, said, “Since we’re on her
staff, she really opens up to us, but she does;
n’t like to be in the public eye.” Altolf said he
was touched when DeCast1'o-Sallis brought
her newborn son to a staff meeting and let
everybody hold him.

But after these meetings, DcCastro—
Sallis and her family retreat to their apart-
ment within the residence hall, which has a
private entrance and an unspoken, unwritten
rule: “Do not disturb.”

Before “family” entered her life, things
were different. Although she is still goal—o1i-
ented and still has the drive to utilize her
social work degree to help others, she now
appreciates life more, and looks forward to
getting up in the morning to hug her son.

DeCaslro—Sallis sees her career as

sidelines: “She’s a true
team player,” he said.
Dabulis has worked
with DeCastro—Sallis
since 1994. He said
that their relationship
has grown from being
colleagues to friends.
They have the ability to bounce ideas oﬂ’
each other and they’ve  from each
other’s ideas, said Dabulis. .

DeCastro—Sallis began her resident
director career as a graduate student, working
part-time for the Office of Residence Life.
By the time she graduated, a full—time pro-
fessional position was open, and DeCastro-
Sallis said she just fell into the position.

“The more I knew, the more responsi-
bility I got,” DcCastro—Sal1is said. She has
worked in. four of the eight resident director
positions, and has progressed from presiding
over a staﬂ° of four with 240 residents to a
staff of 16 with 640 residents.

Altolf said, “She’s an amazing person,
whether it’s on the job or off. She’s motivat-
ed, and she knows the Student Code of
Conduct like the back of her hand.”

But one day it will be time to move on,
and move out. Her cozy apartment within
Sutherland Hall will one day be outgrown.

"Ihe resident director position should
always be seen as a stepping stone,” said
DeCastIo—Sallis. She’d like to further her
career and work in university administration.
She likes Pittsburgh, and she likes her job.

Her biggest frustration, however, is that poo— g

ple don’t recognize what she and the office
do. About 5,000 students live on campus and
are affected by the Office of Residence Life.
DcCastro-Sallis plans to stay to help make
the difference.

Being visible and loud to enhance
awareness of the group’s goals on campus
were two possibilities suggested at Pitt’s
Bisexual, Gay, and Lesbian Alliance’s meet-
ing on Wednesday night.

“I want BiGaLA to be a more visible,
more positive force on campus — not known
as a dating service or left-wing queer group,”
said member Keith Steward.

The group voted to produce a newsletter
which would include facts, policy, and mis-
sion statement about BiGaLA and distribute
1 these leaﬂets around campus.

‘ Christian Baker, leader of BiGaLA.
“We want to be loud,” answered several

THE PITT NEWS

BiGaLA plans to raise its voice

of what BiGaLA stands for, but also to pro-
vide useful facts that everyone could beneﬁt
from.

Some of the other suggested goals for
November included having a task force keep
track of hate crimes on campus, then release
its ﬁndings in a fact pamphlet, and holding a
conference on diversity on campus.

“I add one more goal to the list for
BiGaLA this month,” said member
Marquette Bowman. “I would like you and
the rest of Pitt’s campus to attend a panel dis-
cussion on student life issues.”

This panel discussion of student issues
on campus, scheduled for Nov. 18 at
Benedurn Hall, will include undergraduate
student groups like the Campus Worrren’s
Organization and Black Action Society

Other issues covered in the meeting
were ofﬁce hours, suggestions for the
November social, and announcing upcoming
positions open in BiGaLA for next semester.

 
    
  

BAS tutors spend Saturday in

school for 4th and 5th graders

T M9" Srrfth

Pitt students who belong to the Black
Action Society’s community outreach com-
mittee will tell you that college isn’t always
just about higher learning. Sometimes it
involves relying the things you learned as a
kid, too.

a This is exactly what more than a dozen
BAS members are currently doing in a tutor-
ing project forrned by their partnership with A.
Ieo Weil Elementary School in the Hill
District, making a difference in the lives of the
school’s fourth— and ﬁfth-graders.

‘This is a tremendous ﬁrst step to bridg-
ing the gap between university students and
the community,” said Lawrence Davis, princi-

‘ pal atA Ieo Weil elementary. “I commended

j ﬂiese college students for giving such a valu-
able commitment of their time to this pro-
gram”

The year-long tutoring project focuses on
helping children with their homework, and on
correcting problems they may have missed on

, recent exams. Students are also instructed in

1 math and spelling in order to improve stan-

j dardized test scores.

1 “African-American college students are

i role models for these kids,”said Tomiko

‘ Lyons, chair of the BAS’ community outreach

1 comrrrittee. The community outreach commit-

; tee, designed to serve as a lirrkbetween college

i students and the community of Pittsburgh,

r spends two hours every Saturday morning

I tutoring the A. Leo Weil school children. The
sessions are held at the YMCA on Centre
Avenue.

More than 20 Pitt students signed up as
Itutors on arotating basis. Theirages vary and
, sodotheirmajors, from chemical engineering
Xto social work to accounting. “It’s a great

 

idea,” says Lyons, “and even though we’ve

just started, we are expecting it [the program]

to be very effective.”

Lyons said the program has received a
positive response so far. At last count there
were 20 children signed up for the program
But despite the large number who signed up,
only a handful showed up last Saturday.

Lyons said she thinks the low tumout is
due to several factors. VVrth the colder weath-
er quickly approaching, people are more reluc-
tant to walk anywhere, and people also tend to
forget about things once the weekend comes,
and other commitments have priority, she said

Ten—year old Jarell Bowman didn’t for-
get though, and he even a little early arrived
with his mom, Valarie Bowman, eager to start
his schoolwork. Bowman, escorting her son to
the YMCA on a brisk Saturday moming, said
she thinks the program is extremely worth-
while.‘

Bowrrran got help with his math from
Janeen Greene —— a freshman who is majoring
in English literature. Greene persistently
drilled him on the times tables, emphasizing
the 123, after Bowman informed her that he’s
been having trouble with them.

At the other end of the table from
Bowman sat one of his classmates, 10-year-
old Tamara Rainey. Rainey brought a spelling
worksheet to work on with her tutor, Erika
Benson. Benson, a sophomore chemistry
major, helped Rainey with her trouble spots so
she was able to complete the worksheet on her
own.

Lyons said the program is geared for
work outside the traditional classroom envi-
ronment in order to add a little variety to the
sessions. Field trips are being planned to the
local library, and to the Carnegie Science
Center later on in the year.

Gommoge protestors march outside county courthouse

hedd ‘

 

 

The drizzly, chilly weather on Saturday
aftemoon did not stop 30 protestors from
shouting slogans and marching outside the
Allegheny County courthouse. Protestors
said they wanted justice for Jonny
Gamrnage, who died during a routine trafﬁc
stop while struggling with ﬁve police ofﬁ-
cers on Route 51.

The march was sponsored by the
Campus Coalition for Peace and Justice,
Pitt’s lntemational Socialist Organization,
and the Coalition of African Americans for
Justice. Protestors held signs and shouted
rhyming slogans like “Brutality must stop,
prosecute the cops,” or “Break the silence,

'I'I-IE PI'I'I' NEWS

stop cop violence.”

“I think regardless of the weather, it is
very important that we come out and raise
our voices in protest against the treacherous
act the police committed,” said Barbara
Kline, a Pitt junior studying sociology.
“’Ihere’s problems with the prosecution,
with the judge, and I think we should con—
tinue to put pressure on the local govem-
ment here and the local justice system. 
We can’t leave justice in the hands of the
court.”

Edward Lee, a graduate student at Pitt
studying biochemistry, agreed.

“Unless there are people there, we can’t
see justice come for J onny Gamrnage,” Lee
said. “Police brutality is a problem across
the board, and unless people can become

angry about it and try to change it, [change]
carmot happen  we have to ﬁght against
racism, we have to ﬁght against sexism
[and] homophobia, because all of these
problems are tied together.”

One of the protestors said, “I am
marching because  I have students who
live in Brentwood who told me everyone in
Brentwood knows the police there are out
of control  they sit down on Route 51
waiting to have fun. Partially, fun is beating
up people. I know students from the area tell
me that they aren’t surprised in the least  to
think maybe they didn’t intend to kill
[Gamrnage], but they certainly intended to

the case would be pushed aside or forgotten.

“We are marching because we are con—
cerned that if we don’t put the pressure on,
they might just sweep the whole thing under
the rug,” said Pete Shell, the co-founder of
the Campus Coalition for Peace and Justice,
which is made up of Pitt and CMU faculty
and students. ‘The prosecution is trying

relatives of police ofﬁcers, and prosecution

ecute all ﬁve oﬂicers, and we are not going
to let up until justice has been served.”

Protestors ended the rally by gathering
around and listening to the song ‘The

Inadequate facilities prevent concerts, according to Pitt

Marc Nuzzo

 

Looking for a good concert to go to
this weekend? You won’t find one here
at Pitt, a fact that has left hundreds of
students wondering why.

“We would love to do concerts 
absolutely,” said Tom Misuraca, assis-
tant director of student activities and
advisor to the Pitt Program Council,
“but there are no viable facilities [here
at Pitt] in which to do them.”

Pitt used to host concerts and speak-
ers in the Syria Mosque, which was
razed in 1991. The property is now a
parking lot sitting beside Soldiers and
Sailors Memorial Hall.

The Syria Mosque was a Pittsburgh
concert venue long before the construc-
tion of Star Lake Amphitheater and the
Civic Arena, drawing large crowds to
the performances it hosted.

Big—name acts such as Bette Midler,
George Carlin, and Barbra Streisand
performed in the Syria Mosque, which
was one of only two practical venues for
concerts in the area.

“Shows went very well in the
mosque,” said Misuraca. “It was usable
for [concerts].”

When the mosque was torn down,
the student activities board searched,
without luck, for other venues in which
Pitt could host speakers and bands.

On Feb. 25, 1982, Pitt hosted The
Silencers, today’s equivalent of a band
with Crash Test Dummies’ popularity,
in the David Lawrence Auditorium in
an attempt to find a new concert hall.

According to Joyce Giangarlo, who
had Misuraca’s job in the early ‘80s, the
concert was cramped on the stage,
which is only 11 feet wide at its widest
point and as narrow as two feet on the
ends. a

She told of setting up a makeshift
stage, keeping the crowd from damag-
ing seats, and meeting the technical
needs of the performers.

.“It was difficult then,” Giangarlo

3 said. “Bands nowadays have even high-

er and sometimes unrealistic expecta-

* tions.”

Musical groups of today require

l access to an incredible array of hard-

ware, including high voltage electrical

wiring, dressing rooms, and loading

dock facilities, to put on a show.
“Something as small as having no

6 place to set up spotlights would stop a

concert,” said Misuraca, who was in the
concert business before coming to Pitt.
Around campus, there are a number
of facilities which have been proposed
for concert use, like the David

A Lawrence Auditorium, Fitzgerald Field
6 House, and perhaps the most obvious

choice, Pitt Stadium.
The Fitzgerald Field House has
been used in the past to host such speak-

ers as Louis Farrakhan and events like
the Family House Dance Marathon.

Kimball Smith, the athletic facili-
ties coordinator, spoke of how difficult
it is to work performances and activities
into the athletic facilities.

“These are very busy venues,” said
Smith. “And top priority has to go to the
varsity sports programs.”

Usage priorities are established
through the Athletic Facilities Usage
committee, which grants priority to ath-
letic teams, sports clubs, intramurals,
and general student recreation, respec-
tively.

“Logistically, being able to host
these activities in venues not built for

[concerts], and at the same time not
compromising the physical quality of
the venue, is very difficult,” Smith said.

Smith discussed Pitt Stadium in
particular, saying that concerts would
cause more damage than they would be
worth. Considerations such as food and
drink stains on the turf, the general
damage of audience traffic, as well as
the damage caused by a bands’ equip-
ment are factors which would be prob-
lematic.

According to Misuraca, setup and
takedown of a concert can take any-
where from an entire day to nearly a
week, taking away from the time that
teams could use the facilities.

The proposal of a new convocation
center seems to be Pitt’s last hope of
getting back into the concert business.

“If it is going to be done right, it has
to go up with the proper hardware
installed in it,” Misuraca said. “It is too
difficult and expensive to retrofit a
building with what is needed.”

Considerations such as an auxiliary
gym for athletic team practice while the
convocation center facility is in use and
a crowd friendly design are other fac-
tors in making concerts a reality here at
Pitt.

In the meantime, Pitt students will .

have to continue heading to the Civic
Arena or Star Lake.

Students love walking in a Winter Wonderland

 

Snow fell like manna from heav-
en for the first time this weekend,
and Oaklanders are now getting
ready for winter’s best and worst
gift.

Tim Townsend-Kohns of One
World Trading Co., an outside ven-
dor on the corner of Bigelow
Boulevard and Forbes Avenue, sells
handmade sweaters and jewelry
from around the world. He said he
usually sells jewelry and incense
when the weatheris nice, but yester-
day he sold more gloves and hats
than sweaters.

“Its probably been about 20 to
one [gloves and hats to sweaters],”
Townsend—Kohn said. “There are a
lotta people looking.”

The next four days are forecast-
ed to be cold and cloudy with peri-
ods of snow and ﬂurries, according

, to the Bell Atlantic weather service

which is good news for students who
can’t get enough of the snow.

“I love winter,” said Devin
Corboy, a freshman psychology
major. “I love the cold weather.”

With the stores already decorat-
ed with wreaths and white lights, the
mood of anticipation for the holi-
days is heightened by the
snowflakes, according to one
woman standing at a bus stop.

Kathy Elledge, a manager at
GapKids on Walnut St., said they
were busy helping customers all day.

“We were swamped — people
were buying everything,” Elledge
said.

She said the store beat last
year’s figures for the day and even
surpassed today’s goal for the store.

in biology, said she was excited for
the snow because she skis.

“I like the snow, but I hate the
cold,” Woomer said. “I need to get
my winter jacket out.”

She walked quickly towards
Schenley Quad with her shoulders
hunched Other students shuffled
through campus, their hands tucked
into their pockets and the cold wind
blowing back their hair.

The hot dog man who usually
has his stand on the corner of
Bigelow Boulevard and Forbes
Avenue in front of Hillman Library
wasn’t there yesterday. By 5:00
p.m., the other food vendors had
gone.

The steps of the William Pitt
Union didn’t have the usual crowd
talking and hanging out with

friends. Only a few people stood to '

talk on the streets. One or two peo-
ple stayed out long enough to smoke
a cigarette and hurried back inside
out of the cold.

For Jianqiang.Fan, a graduate
student from China, the winter is
clearly here. When askedwhat he
thought of the snow, he replied, “It’s
heavy.”

5GB says escort

service may be
discontinued

Jlennifer Stine

Students who use the Student Escort
Service to walk around campus safely may
have to ﬁnd another way to do it.

According to announcements made at

‘last week’s Student Government Board

I

Meeting, the escort service may be discon-
tinued due to lagging participation and
expensive operating costs.

Currently, an average of 2.3 students
use the escort service per night at a cost of
approximately $30 per student.

Board member Justin DalMolin said
something very important has to happen for
Pitt to consider keeping the service.

“Students have to use the escort ser-
vice,” DalMolin said.

If the number of students using the
escort service doesn’t increase, DalMolin
said the University is considering abolishing
the escort service and using the money
saved towards more emergency call boxes
and other safety measures.

Junior Amy Sitnik said abolishing the
escort service is a bad idea. As a student
escort and someone who uses the service
frequently, she said it is an invaluable pro-
gram and should be kept at all costs.

“It’s a wonderful service that should
never be lost Is it worth someone getting
raped or mugged?” Sitnik asked.

To keep the service viable, DalMolin
proposed the escort service be transferred
from the Oﬂice of Student Activities to the
Department of Public Safety. The move
would save $5,500.

But John DiV1tto, assistant vice—chan-
cellor of business and ﬁnance, said the trans-
fer will not make the service any more elTec-
tive, and escorts would become “a junior
police force.” A decision on the transfer is
still pending.

Also discussed at last week’s meeting
was a plan to help reduce paper waste in the
Oakland area.

' The Environmental Committee plans to
help reduce waste in Oakland by imple-
menting a reusable mug system with area
businesses.

Plastic mugs with participating busi-
nesses listed on the side would be distributed
to students for free. Students could then use
the mugs at participating businesses instead
of paper cups. i

According to Environmental
Committee Chair Laura Frecon, everyone
wins with the new system. Students who use
mugs will receive discounts, and businesses
will receive free advertising, according to
Frecon.

"The mug system will beneﬁt the stu-
dents, the businesses, and the earth,” she
said

The mugs will be distributed to students

Bring in the bands, we
need to be entertained

How could Pitt raise the money for the new convocation
center? We have the perfect idea — concerts. Tom Misuraca,
the assistant director of student activities and advisor to the Pitt
Program Council, says that there are no viable sites at which to
hold concerts, but what about Fitzgerald Field House and Pitt
Stadium?

Consider this scenario: a hot summer night, a gentle breeze
wafts through the stadium, and Bob Dylan is standing at center
stage on the 50-yard line. Everyone sits back, relaxes, and not
only has a good time, but also contributes to the building of a
new convocation center. The answer truly is blowin’ in the
wind. .

How about The Rolling Stones in the middle of the winter?
When the weather outside is frightful, gimme shelter in
Fitzgerald Field House. Seeing Mick Jagger strut through the
Field House would warm our hearts and the funds would give
the basketball team a brand-spanking new court on which to
play. Isn’t this the season for charity? Are /we all just a bunch of
Ebenezer Scrooges? Bah humbug!

Concerts at Pitt would bolster student morale in so many
ways. Just think about it. Doesn’t it hurt your school spirit to

' think that CMU hosts concerts every year, and that Duquesne

has the A.J. Palumbo Center and puts on concerts all of the
time? Pitt just‘can’t compete. But that can change.

It would do the student body good to know that it had been
instrumental in funding the new convocation center and not just
through higher tuition. The ticket sales from the concerts would
go toward making the convocation center a reality.

Putting on concerts would not be frivolous entertainment if
the money were to go to a convocation center. By getting stu-
dents to contribute money by purchasing tickets to a concert
that they would pay TicketMaster or the Civic Arena for, every-
one is happy. Students get to see the concerts they want to see,
and the University gets the convocation center it’s been dream-
ing of. A

Is it true love or just another bluff?

 

In the immortal words of
Miracle Max; “He did not say ‘true
love’, he said ‘toooo blaaave’ and as
weallknowthatmeans ‘to bl .’”In
this oft-quoted line, uttered by none
other than Billy Crystal in "The
Princess Bride,” there is some intrin-
sic wisdom I often laugh at myself
when I am in a romantic stupor and
think of this quote (not to mention the
rest of the movie).

This passage seems to shed
some light on certain common rela-
tionship mishaps. Our distorted per-
ceptions of reality, and our ideas of
what we want thingstobelike, rather
than what they are, seem to fan the
ﬁre of a bloated infatuation. This
“blufl” rears its ugly head in the
beginning. of most budding
romances, and sometimes never dis-
appears. That is, of course, until some
anti-cupid reality missile comes
careening out of nowhere and shoots
a few holes in the wings of the angels
of love and they are cast back down
to the cold, hard, worldly Earth.
People with this infatuation problem
can not diagnose themselves. They
need a little help ﬁom their grounded
ﬁiends. You know who they are. At
parties they are attached not only at
the hips, but at the lips and possibly
other extremities. It’s more like “true
lust” than “true love.’’ It is our
responsibility to bring these lofty
beings slowly down to earth, by con-
vincing them to separate for more
than 30 seconds from their induced
Siamese 

On occasion, it does work itself
out. Infatuation sometimes fades

away slowly and when reality sets in,
real love can grow. This probably
can’t happen without the prior exis-
tence of the infatuation demon, but
we must take the good with the bad.
In this new land of “true love,”
humanly habits are endearing and not
armoying, and grievances are forgiv-
en and not kept festering in one’s psy-
che. Is there such a relationship? I
think it is possible to achieve some-
thing close to this, or at least I hope
so.

The idealization of the concept
of “true love’’ may be a detriment to
cunent and future relationships. This
idealization is based on the afore-
mentioned infatuations. The clichés
“Love at ﬁrst sight,” “Star-crossed
lovers,” and millions of others, are
ample evidence. It should read
“Infatuation at ﬁrst sight Love after a
long time.” When one places too
much stock in this initial elation, real-
ity seems to be transcended. In fact, it
is merely teetering out of sight on the
highest shelf, poised to come crash-
ing down on‘ the lovers’ delicate
skulls.

Is there only one intended mate
for each of us? If you are in a rela-
tionship where you think that your
signiﬁcant other is “The One,” a con-
ﬁdence—shattering break up is disas-
trous. It tends to foster the “I missed
the last bus and I am stuck in
Cleveland forever!” syndrome. This
attitude causes depression, moping
around the living space, and in gener-
al, armoying the hell out of ﬁiends
and random others who observe the
heart-shaped patch on your sleeve.
That’s not to say you can’t think

someone is “The One,” but I think"

you can achieve true love with more
than one person (not at the same time,’
silly). The only thing special about
love is how hard you work at it.

‘ Easier said than done!

Can two souls ever become
one? I think so. After a while in a rela-
tionship where good communication
is fostered, it can eventually happen
(OK. you can stop sticking your ﬁn-
gers down your throat now). At a cer-
tain point, love becomes uncondi-
tional. After this point, no matter how
much circumstances and people
change, the love will still be there.
Thereisacertainpartofeveryunique
human being that never changes.
When that part is revealed, shared,
and loved between two people, a
spiritual kind of love is achieved.
This love can never completely be
revoked. There is a risk though,
always a catch, because circum-
stances and extemal change have the
nasty ability to tear people apart
When there is a breakup after this
type of love, it as if it happened to two
pieces of paper glued together. When
they are ripped apart by worldly
problems, there are rips and tears and
a part of each paper remains attached
to the other, not to mention the holes
left behind. I’m still convinced it’s
worth the risk.

True love can only be achieved
through hard work. There is more
that one mate for every person.
Though rare, if you ﬁnd someone
that it works well with, hold on to
him. So keep searching for the real
kind of love.

Jay DeManino is another of those
illustrious ﬁsh in the sea who is still
searching for his true love.

 

Some weeks ago, I was amused to
read a column in The Pitt News by a
more conservative colleague of mine
that offered an interesting theory about
why President ‘Clinton was about to

' humiliate the Republican party by

becoming the first Democrat since FDR
to win consecutive terms as president:
that the nefarious entitlement system has
created a cradle-to—the—grave welfare
state that is so addictive people will vote
for anyone in order to preserve it. An
interesting theory — too bad it cannot
possibly be true. Why? It defies com-
mon sense: if the American people are
such suckers for liberal politicians, then
why didn’t they vote for uber—liberals
like Walter Mondale and Mike Dukakis?

The real secret behind the presi-
dent’s victory last Tuesday cannot possi-
bly be his liberality. He is the most con-
servative Democratic president since
Grover Cleveland. Look at his record.
He pledged to cut the budget deficit in
half and ended up cutting it 60 percent.
The president promised to slash the fed-
eral bureaucracy, which ballooned under
Reagan and Bush, and delivered on his
promise. The president’s two biggest ini-
tiatives, Goals 2000 and Americorps, are
small change (a total of $750 million)
compared to some of the big spending
programs like the $11-billion

Moderation, there's more to it than just the middle ground  

Superconducting Supercollider, which

‘ avowed foes of federal spending like

Texas Sen. Phil Grarnrn supported to
bring jobs to the Lone Star state.
President Clinton also granted 69
waivers to 41 states to allow them lati-
tude to experiment with their welfare
programs so they may give their con-
stituents better services for less money.
Reagan and Bush allowed just 14 such
waivers in 12 years. The facts are clear
— Bill Clinton is a moderate.

After the 1994 elections, I got sick
of hearing smug TV pundits talk about
how America was a conservative coun-
try, and how the Democratic party was
doomed to an imminent demise. They
were wrong. The American people are
neither conservative nor liberal. They
are moderates and they hate politics
(look at the record low voter turnout this
year). That is the big message of 1996.
Consider this:

Bob Dole ran on a platform that
advocated cutting taxes without balanc-
ing the budget. He lost. Republican
Senate candidates in New Jersey and
Minnesota ran ads denouncing their
opponents as “foolishly liberal” and
“embarrassingly liberal”. They lost. The
Republican leadership made extravagant
claims about how they would pad their
majority in the House of

Representatives, but their majority got
shaved less than 30 votes. Despite heav-
ily outspending Democrats with money

from their special—interest groups, more

Republican incumbents fell than
Democrats, and more than 20
Republican Congressmen won with less
than 52 percent of the vote. Neither the
Republicans nor the Democrats have or
will have ironclad control of Congress in
the immediate future.

Other leaders have followed Bill
Clinton’s moderate path with consider-
able success. New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and Philadelphia Mayor Ed
Rendell have shunned simplistic conser-
vative and misguided liberal solutions to
complex problems. Mayor Rendell is a
Democrat and Mayor
Guiliani is a
Republican, yet their

programs in their
respective cities are
virtually identical:
offering their con-

stituents better ser-
vices for less money,
while still preserving
the safety ‘net.

The result? New
York’s crime rate has
fallen significantly and Mayor Rendell’s
program has managed to halt the city’s
slide into financial chaos (no small feat
given the city’s disastrous situation in
1991). Both cities are better off now than

they were before Guiliani and Rendell

came along.
Michael Kinsley remarked that dur-

 

 

ing the l980s the liberals looked “for
heretics, while the conservatives looked
for converts.” Now the opposite is true.
While the Republicans, obsessed about
ideological purity, griped that the presi-
dent was taking away their agenda, the
American people saw merit in the presi-
dent’s moderation and re—elected him.
Only a last-rninute dash away from Bob
Dole’s sinking campaign saved the GOP
Congressional majority.

Thankfully, in the new Congress,
moderates will wield considerable
power. The Democrats of The Coalition
and the GOP Mainstream Conservative
Alliance will make
up a large bloc of
votes in the 105th
Congress and have
made it clear that they
want an end to parti-
san bickering. One
GOP moderate
r e m a r k e d ,
“Government is basi-
cally ruled from the
center, and those who
rule from the center
are always players, particularly if the
count is fairly close.” I am hopeful that
the 105th Congress and President
Clinton can see eye—to—eye enough to put
aside their differences and work togeth-
er on issues like entitlement reform.
Michael Berquist is hoping for an end to
politics as usual.

It was a weird,
wild, wacky

weekend

The god of sport decided to have a lit-
tle fun last weekend with the NFL. No
underdog could be counted out, no lead
was safe, and has-beens became heroes.

_ To start off: the most ridiculous stat of
the weekend. Arizona Cardinals quarter-
back, Boomer Esiason, amassed 522 pass-
ing yards, going 35-59 with 3 touchdowns.
The total marked the third-greatest number
of passing yards in a game in the history of
the NFL. Esiason led the pitiful Cardinals
to their first win in the NFC East and their
fourth overall.

What’s shocking is not just the fact
that Boomer was a TV analyst last year and
that he was washed up before he left his
original team, the Bengals, but that the
Cardinals are one of the worst—passing
teams in the league.

The other has—been hero of this game
was Cardinal kicker Kevin Butler. Butler
was cut by the Bears at the beginning of the
year for inconsistency. He was signed last
week by the Cards because their kicker
(Greg Davis) had blown a game the week
before. Butler was the dubious hero of this
game. He botched a 32—yarder in the begin-
ning of overtime. Later, he missed again on
a 37-yard try, but an offsides penalty on the
Skins gave him his third chance to win.
This time, he hit it.

The underdog Bengals, Chiefs, and
Bucs all found a way to win, too. The
Bengals were down 17-10 to the Steelers
with ﬁve seconds left in the half.
Pittsburgh’s Norm Johnson booted a line-
drive kick to David Dunn at the 10. Dunn
then trotted through the Steelers’ slow-
motion coverage team for a 90-yard touch-
down and a 17-17 tie.

It was a wacky play. Steeler radio
armouncer (and former Pitt alum) Myron
Cope said, “I wasn’t even paying attention,
and then all the sudden they’re [the
Bengals] in the end zone.”

In the second‘ half, the Bengals had

The University of Pittsburgh’s
women’s basketball team finished
last season in the semifinals of the
Big East Tournament after a stun-
ning upset of Villanova in the first
round.

This year, they hope to pick up

lwhere they left off. Their season

was a bit disappointing last year.
They finished 13th in the Big East
and seventh in the Big East 7.
They were an inexperienced

the team gained last year will pay

off.

They are returning four
starters, including 6-foot—2 senior

about 20 games last year.

Bruce said, “She [Thompson]
and the rest of the returning
starters have gained experience to
mix with their youth.”

He calls them a young team but

Adamson SCIVOTS sweet senior SBCISOH

..G9.°f*..M9°k

This has been a sweet cross country
season for Pitt senior Ed Adamson. A
knee injury spoiled his 1995 cross coun-

try season. It wasn’t until the 1996

spring track season, during the track sea-
son, that he was back up to peak perfor-
mance.

After failing to break 26 minutes last
season, Adamson improved to 24:50 at
the 1996 Big East Championship meet
two weeks ago in Boston.

“Since August 1995, he’s trained
consistently. That’s the key,” said Pitt

Cross Country Coach Dave Sobal.-

“Some people never ﬁgure that out.”

It usually doesn’t take Adamson
long to ﬁgure things out. He already
knows that he wants to work with kids,
and he’s not wasting any time now get-
ting experience.

Adamson is majoring in child devel-
opment. He is currently putting his

 

major to use as an intern at Children’s
Hospital. He’s considering going on to
grad school in the school of social work
at Pitt.

In the past, he has also worked at
Pitt’s University Child Development
Center, where he taught 6- to 12-year-
olds over the summer, and the CMU

Day Care Center, where he taught a 4- to .

5-year old preschool class.

With his busy schedule, the time
Adamson has to practice often is not
when the rest of the team practices. It’s
taken teamwork for Adamson to have
training partners, and he appreciates his
teammates.

‘.‘We have a great bunch of guys this
year. We’ve been a little more team-ori-

ented than we have in the past,”

Adamson said. “They help out, doing
workouts late and stuff.”

His teammates may have made
Adamson better, but Adamson puts in a
lot of work on his own, according to
Coach Sobal.

“He has worked hard, and it shows.
He eventually rises to the top in races
and in workouts,” Sobal said. “I hope
everybody else is paying attention to
what he has accomplished.”

Soccer, not running, was Adarnson’s
first sport. He started playing soccer at
just six years old. Since soccer occupied

his autumns, he didn’t join the DuBois-

High School cross country team until his
junior year. He did start earlier in track.
“In seventh grade, we did a timed
mile in gym class. My gym teacher said
maybe I should think about going out for
the track team. I really just did it as an

- extracurricular activity until my sopho-

more year in high school. That’s when I
got serious.” 7

He won that mile race, his first
timed race ever, with a time of 6: 18. Not
surprisingly, the mile is still one of
Adamson’s favorite events. ’

“I love the steeplechase, and I love,

the mile too,” Adamson said. “Track’s

For the most part, the last four
years for this team have been pretty
good. They have reached the semi-
finals of the Big East Tournament
all four years. The team only hopes
to start off better than they did last
year, and they do not want to have
to wait until the Big East
Tournament to upset teams such as
Miami and Villanova, which they
did last year.

The Lady Panthers have one of
the toughest schedules in the Big
East Conference, possibly the
nation. This can only help them
when they come across tough oppo-
nents late in the season or in the
tournament. Their season opens
Thursday night at Fitzgerald Field

great, but I’m a little biased toward
cross country. I love them both for dif-
ferent reasons. In cross country, every-
one’s going up against everyone in the
same event. You got half—rr1ilers up to
10,000 meter guys all racing the same

‘ distance. Then you go to track and it

gets more specialized. Milers race only
against milers.” ' A

Despite his diverse interests within
running, Adamson knows what his spe-
cialty is.

“I see myself as a distance ——
5,000—l0,000 meter — guy. I just love
the mile too,” Adamson said.

Adarnson’s running career had an
element of continuity from high school
to college, something lacking for many
runners. In high school, his rival school
was Punxsutawney. After running
against them in high school, Adamson
now lives with two products of
Punxsutawney High School -— Scott
Curry, now a junior on the Pitt cross
country team, and former Pitt runner
Dennis Kuntz.

“That kind of bridges high school
and college,” Adamson said. “It was
easy to become friends with those guys.
We have a lot in common.”

Once he got to college, there was
little continuity. Adamson was recruited
by former Pitt Coach Jim "Lear, who
now coaches at Duquesne. Lear’s
efforts. as well as Pitt’s location — close
to home, but not too close — are what
drew Adamson to Pitt four years ago.

That was four years ago, though,
and while Pitt’s location hasn’t changed,
Lear is now a distant memory. In fact,
this is the first time in four years that
Adamson has had the same coach for
two consecutive cross country seasons.
It’s not that he didn’t like all of them,
but the constant turnover was hardly
what Adamson had in mind when he
came here.

“I liked [Lear] a lot. I thought he
would be a great coach to be under for
four years,” Adamson said. “I like the
way [current coach Dave] Sobal coach-
es us now, too.”

The Chiefs were home underdogs for
the first time in more than two years. Now,
the Chiefs are one of the better teams in the
league. They manhandled the Super Bowl-

indicative of the Chiefs’ play. They were up
27-6 midway through the third quarter and
held the league’s most explosive player,
Brett Favre, in check.

seen a team just down the ball like that on
three consecutive plays.

The Raiders deserved to lose because
of their “no guts” attitude. The sports god

was the Bucs’ second win of the season.

top technology companies.

MY FIDELITY EXPERI ENCE:'

’'It was time for me to find a world-class
technical challenge...and I found it at
Fidelity Investments.

At Fidelity, I have access to world-
class technical resources. And I'm getting
exceptionally broad experience. Rotating
to a new assignment every six months,
I've had the opportunity to work with a
variety of technologies and businesses —
from database design and mainframe
applications to client—server, C++,
PowerBuilder, and DBMS. I've even
developed applications for automated
trading, engineered a global trust system,
and worked on the corporate Web site.
In fact, Fidelity is so committed to new
technology they've launched a company
to market the business software we
develop. Even the training program is
leading—edge.

If you're looking for one of the world's
best technology challenges, it's time you
discovered Fidelity."
