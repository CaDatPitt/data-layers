How Pitt’s Business and Finance office is
spending its money and the status of major
construction projects on campus highlight-
ed yesterday’s University Senate meeting.

“I regard my ‘duties as a stewardship, and
that requires letting you know what is going

on,” Vice Chancellor of Business and‘ 

Finance Ben Tuchi said.

Tuchi told the audience his vision for his
office was “to be among the most efficient
and respected organizations of its type on
any campus in the country.” _

Tuchi broke down the university’s $705
million budget into the major responsibility
areas, of which Business and Finance repre-
sents $11O million or 16 percent.

Tuchi listed major components in
Business and Finance as: Budget and
Administration; Business; Computing and
Information Services; Controller’s Office
and Facilities Management.

Each component identified its major
responsibilities, fiscal expenditures and
number of full time employees.

The largest component, with a budget of
$43,392,507, "is Business. Its direct reporting
areas included Book Centers, Central
Business Services, Food Services, Housing
Services, Parking and Transportation and
Public Safety. ‘

Tuchi reported that the Business compo-
nents were fully self-supporting, selling
goods and services to produce revenues.
“Surplus revenues are transferred at year-
end, and the principal is invested. [These
funds] are used to fund university initia—

. tives,” T uchi said.

Facilities Management, with a budget of
$32,867,065, has direct reporting areas of
Engineering and Construction,
Environmental Health and Safety, Facilities
Planning, Operations and Maintenance,
Property Acquisition and Management and
Administration.

Assistant Vice Chancellor for Business
and Finance Rhonda Gross reviewed the
status of major construction "projects on
campus.

Some construction projects are being pur-
sued with state assistance under the

According to Scaffidi, the executive board
decided to let the results of the election.
stand after hearing testimony from both
sides. ‘The executive board issued a formal
apology to Travis for any problems that
may have happened in the voting process,
but Scaffidi said the numbers involved were
too little to have any effect on the election.

“Nakeea was justified in filing a com-
plaint,” Grace said. “I formally‘ apologize for

certain inadequacies.”

Travis said after the hearing that she is
not happy with the decision. “I was disap-

the committees who handle the events for
answers, who can you turn to?”

“I’m not doing this for recognition or
sympathy,” Travis said. “Voting will never
ever be perfectly correct. I just want every-
one to get a fair shot.” ‘ '

Travis said she and several other students
witnessed some students being turned
away from the Towers Lobby polling booth
for not having validation ID stickers, while
certain other students were allowed to vote
a couple minutes later.

According to Travis, this year’s valid iden-

Five-year—old Laura Davies
from Britain, who had a
seven-organ transplant on
Sept. 26,1992 was back in the
intermediate intensive care
unit at Children’s Hospital of
Pittsburgh on Monday. She is
listed as being in stable but
critical condition after having
a relapse over the weekend.

On Sunday she developed
breathing problems, and doc-
tors said they felt she should
be put back in ICU where her

Five—year-old transplant recipient stable

condition. can be closely

monitored. She is currently,

breathing with the help of a
respirator.

“Laura is alert and awake
and watches various videos
and has been finger painting
while in bed. She is fairly
active but is wobbly on her
feet and must remain in bed
due to the respirator,”
Margaret LeMasters,
spokesperson for Children’s
Hospital, said. All of the
transplanted organs are
doing well thus far, and there
have been no signs of rejec-

tion. She received her second
transplant because her body
had rejected the first one,
which was performed in June
of 1992.

The first transplant per-
formed gave her a new liver
and small intestine, but
because of rejection soon
after, a transplant was need-
ed for the entire abdominal
block.The new organs she
received the second time
were a liver, a small intestine,

a large intestine, both kid-

neys, a pancreas and a stom-
ach. V

A liver biopsy was done
but her doctors are still wait-
ing on the results. “If there
signs of rejection, then
Laura’s medication will be
altered,” LeMasters said. “She
is doing well emotionally for
a five year old to have under-
gone so much trauma in so
little time. Her parents are
also doing well and are hop-
ing for a speedy recovery.”

Davies is the first recipient
to have undergone the first
and rare seven-organ trans-
plant last year at Children’s
Hospital.

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Thursday, October 14, 1993

Talking about things more openly helps problems

I have written in a previous
article about the problem of
people who respond to person-
al slights with excessive anger
or aggression. These individuals

‘lash out physically or verbally

and create all kinds of problems
for themselves and others
around them.

Another kind of anger that is
also destructive is inhibited

, anger. This occurs when angry

feelings are felt but not openly
expressed. Sometimes the per-
son is very aware of the unex-
pressed angry feelings, but at
other times the feelings are
pushed out of consciousness
and denied.

Sometimes people inhibit
these feelings because they dis-
covered in childhood that it was
dangerous to express them.
Others are fearful that if they

_express anger they will disturb

their present relationships.

It is the withholding of these
feelings, however, that is more
likely to ruin a relationship than
the expressing of them. This is
so because the
angry or aggres-
sive feelings
always find a
way to emerge.
People who do

not express
their anger
directly, for

example, may

 

harm than good. We all need to
become better at expressing our
feelings of anger as we experi-
ence them and not let them sirn—
mer inside. This does not mean
that we should
lash out with
every angry
impulse we
have, but it does
mean letting the
- people we care
about know
. when they have
done something

find more pas-
sive ways to express it. They
may withdraw, sulk, forget
important appointments, have
sexual difficulties, feel
depressed or even flunk out of
school if the person with whom
they are angry is a parent.

All of these conscious and
unconscious strategies do more

that hurts or
upsets us. This openness of
expression frees us“ emotionally,
helps to resolve problems open-
ly and earns us the respect that
all of us seek. Some call this
kind of behavior constructive
self—assertion. When we ask
directly for what we want, talk
openly and tactfully about the

things that upset us, and
encourage others to share more
openly with us,.the personal
payoff is immense.

It is more difficult to resolve
anger that may be rooted in
traumatic childhood experi-
ences. But since we know that
this inhibited anger always finds
a way to express itself, we can

be alert to those unexplainable .

bouts of moodiness, depression

or unfocused anger that we may

experience.

If these problems become
too troublesome, you might
want to seek some professional
counseling in order to better
understand and cope with
them.

Many of the problems that
plague us in this area, however,
can be helped if we can only
learn to talk more openly about
the things that upset us.

THE  r 14,1993 g p ;
O-COP strives to unite Oakland community,’ improve safety

By Mark Gordon
For The Pitt News

According to the Oakland
Community Oriented Policing
program, in recent years police
officers in Oakland have lost
respect in the community, and
that is why O—COP was formed.

The program began last April,
and currently there are three
campus police officers involved,
covering North, South and

> Central Oakland. The officers

are assigned to walk the streets
and deal with any problem that
arises, not just criminal activity.

Harassment

Continued from page 1

« harassment usually backfire, according to
Fitzgerald. “The more assertive the response, the
more negative the outcome,” she said.

Fitzgerald said there should be informal as well
as formal processes to handle complaints. “Any
university that doesn’t provide for informal reso-

— lution isrft doing its job,” she said. I»

Combatting sexual harassment involves educat-
ing offenders and administrators responsible for
developing policies. Fitzgerald said sometimes all

’_!‘s‘¢T 'v-”t!‘--"Kn? '.-.<£;.='*r- -

Janice Markowitz, the co-chair
of O—COP, said it is “very irnpor—
tant to let students know that
there is a pro-active effort to
help out new and old students
at Pitt.” ,

She said that the overall goal
of the program is to “solve any
issues that arise in the commu-
nity.”

She said -the program can
help students with problems
ranging from absentee landlords

to serious violent crimes.

According to Pitt Police Sgt.
Charles Grier, the program is
designed to be preventive by

“stopping problems before they
become problems.”

One of the best facets of the
program, said Grier, is the
impact detail. Grier explained
that it is an attempt by the city
of Pittsburgh and Pitt to share
police power.

Impact detail takes one cam-
pus police officer and one city
officer and puts them into four
groups of two. The pairs are
assigned to patrol from the
Original Hot Dog Shop down to
Forbes Hall; They work on
weekends from 8 p.m. until 4
a.m.

The officers are there to make
all citizens of the Oakland com-
munity, especially Pitt students,
feel more safe, Grier said.

Pat Scanlon, the other co-
chair of O-COP, explained that
one of the first projects of the
program is to begin to clean up
the streets and buildings of
Oakland. Scanlon said, “We
want to make a statement about
our ability to take back our
community.” She said that van-

dalism was the program’s first
choice because “graffiti is a
clear communication of a com-
munity on decline.”

All of the people involved in
O—COP stress the importance of
students getting involved in the
program. Markowitz said that
they are in the middle. of
preparing seminars for students
that will include neighborhood
safety techniques and CPR train-
ing.

that is needed to change behavior is information.
“Once you educate university administrators,
they are often remarkably supportive,” she said. ‘
She said many victims simply want the offender
to stop without the victims getting hurt. She relat-
ed examples of university advocates who would
informally tell a professor of a series of com-

plaints about him. Often, the shocked professor

would change the offending behavior.

Projects that will be funded

the Undergraduate School of

Iroquois Building project, with a

construction and various pro-
jects at regional campuses.

Gross also told the gathering
that the master plan for the uni-
versity was progressing. A five-,
10- and 20-year plan detailing
boundaries, new construction,
parking and traffic patterns is
required by the city before any
new construction can begin.

Jane Downey, of the City of
Pittsburgh Planning
Commission, said a revision of
the city’s zoning ordinances was
underway, but that the project
wouldn’t be completed until
1995. “Oakland is perhaps the
most complicated area within
the city,” Downey said. “And
the university has taken the
position of including the com-
rnunity’s interests in its plans for
expansion.” Initiatives for the
upcoming year, according to
Tuchi, include forming partner-
ships with the academic com-
munity to improve his depart-
ment; implement the recom-
mendations of an outside con-
sulting firm to ‘improve the
Human Resources Department;
make Facilities Management

posed information architecture

Kelly Wilmoth and Steve

candidates, confirmed that a

the voting told the candidates
that valid ID stickers were not
necessary if voters could prove

in the Towers Lobby where a
black student went to vote and
was told the polls were closed.
She said she then observed a
white student being allowed to
vote, and she made it known

that she had seen it. The black
student was then able to vote.

Homecoming Queen candi-
date Stacey Leshock said she too
saw students at one of the
polling booths after the sched-
uled closing time of 4 pm.

Travis also said she witnessed
students voting after the polling
booths’ closing time.“It’s really
unfair that nothing is going to be

rules may have become tangled
between the director and the
committee members.

“There are bound to be mis-
takes with every election,”
Assistant Director of Student
Activities Tom Misuraca said. “I
think the election was handled
weH by volunteer students.”

Another statement by Travis
was that-the PPC voting commit-
tee was not culturally diverse.

“A diverse committee might
have helped this situation,”
Travis said. “Pitt is a very cultur-
ally diverse school.The commit-
tee should reﬂect that.”

Grace said that Travis does
have the option to appeal the
case to the director of Student
Activities. A ’

Travis said she has yet to
decide whether she will appeal
it or not.

thing is wrong, we want to
know about it. There are bound
to be mistakes with every elec-

Walker said he felt the PPC
wasn’t fully receptive of Travis’
criticisms.“They said they’d look
into it in the future,” he said.
“But I think it’s something to
look into now. People spent a

America's prosperity is irreversibly tied to that of other
regions of the world. It takes only a casual scan through The Wall Street
Iournal, The New York Times, or any periodical, to see that one of the

regions to which the U.S. is most closely tied and increasingly depen-
dent on is East Asia. .

In the last twenty years, the American economy has become
increasingly enmeshed in the world economy. In l990, exports
contributed to nearly 90% of the growth in the U.S. economy. However

‘during the same period, African Americans were hurt more by these
changes in the world economy than any other ethnic group in America.
One reason is that African Americans are under-represented in those
exports fields where the US. has been most successful.

The aim of the ”African Americans in Asia” conference is to
illustrate to African Americans the many different business, profes-
sional and academic opportunities in Asia. No matter what profession
or field of study, developing a better understanding of Asia increases
marketability and broadens one’s career possibilites.

Consider these facts: since 1983, the world's center of gravity
has shifted from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Asia has become the fastest-
growing economic region in the world. In the mid-19805, Asia held half
the world's population and by the year 2000 it will have two-thirds. It
is a $3 trillion economy growing at $3 billion a week! The rise of Asia
will continue to be detrimental to the African American community
only if we ignore this trend and fail to capitalize on it.

9 African Americans must stake a claim in the international
economy simply because it is necessary for the continued growth and
prosperity of African American lives at home. The failure to do so will
result in furtherdis-enfranchisement from a major part of the economic —
system. Any success that an African American firm has abroad
inevitably has a positive effect on the general community and eventu-
ally contributes to greater socio-economic empowerment. If the Afri-
can American business community intends to take advantage of the
current trends in international investment, trade and development, it
must assert a presence in East Asia.

All of our distinguished panelists have focused their diverse
backgrounds towards career opportunities in Asia. Their knowledge
of Asian languages and cultures have uniquely prepared them to take
advantage of exciting jobs in that world arena and make important
contributions to their communities at home.

Plan to attend our conference and hear the panelists describe their
personal experiences in Asia. Discover how your own career aspira-
tions can be realized and tailor-made with an Asian focus. We hope
you can invest the whole day. If you cannot personally come, consider
assigning someone to represent you.

in many studies. In one study -

only 5 percent of student vic-

than 5 percent of workplace vic-

of those, even less filed a formal

A a risk,” Fitzgerald said.

Using standard, sound
methodology is necessary to
counter those who trivialize the
issue or say it’s a “feminist plot,”
according to Fitzgerald.

“The body of knowledge is
growing by leaps and bounds
the last two years,”.she said.

data on your own campuses.’_’
She said universities should do
their own surveys and publicize
results of complaints.

There are no centralized
reports or records, such as in
rape or assault cases, and
record keeping varies by state,
according to Fitzgerald. ‘

After research, the second
area to work on is legislation,
according to Fitzgerald, who
said “the most important thing
we can do” is to require
employers to institute and post

   

policies, including training of

personnel.
The third area is legal reform.

“We must revamp the legal sys-
tem to prevent revictimization,”
she said. Other recommenda-
tions include providing guide-
lines to judges, training for
enforcement personnel and

‘advocates to assist victims

through the stress of the legal
system.

Responding to a question
about oversensitivity to the
issue, Fitzgerald said “people
are walking on eggshells but
that’s not all bad.” She said false
complaints amount to less than
1 percent. .

Fitzgerald mentioned ways to
prevent sexual harassment.

“There  very, very good data
suggesting that if in the organi-
zational climate and manage-
ment attitude  sexual harass-
ment won’t be tolerated, you
get lower levels of problems.”
The best predictor of potential
sexual harassment is “simple
gender ratios,” implying that
affirmative action programs act
as strong interventions against
sexual harassment, Fitzgerald
said. The sex of administrators
is also a predictor of potential
problems.

“It is important to have
women in high levels of n1an—
agement,” she said.

Forget about alcohol. You need to drink coffee when
you listen to live jazz. With caffeine racing through your
bloodstream, you really understand where the sax solo

I is going, or why the drummer is letting out with

machine gun like explosions. Coffee puts it all into per-

-spective.

With that in mind, the CMU Graduate Coffeehouse is
the perfect place for this year’s Avant—Garde Jazz
Festival to take place. On Saturday four bands will take
the stage at the coffeehouse, each deﬁning, or perhaps

"chucking, the label, “avant-garde” with their own

schtick.

Saxophonist Thomas Chapin’s musical résurné reads
like an elaborate cross reference of jazz styles. From
1981-1986 he played lead alto and served as musical
director in Lionel Hampton’s Big Band.

While much‘ of Chapin’s current work might not hint
at the Hampton bancl’s traditional swing sound, this
work left a strong impact on him. “I was basically a
timid person,” Chapin said in an interview earlier this
year, “so my role in Hampton’s band helped me learn

the speed

of bop

by mike shcmley

 

how to be a leader.”

A few years after playing with Hampton, Chapin
moved to Brooklyn where he embarked on a number
of musical projects, including the electric improvisation
of Machine Gun and formation of his trio with bassist
Mario Pavone and drummer Steve Johns. While
Machine Gun’s music features funk backbeats with cut-
and—paste voices and chaotic guitar and saxophone

wailings on top of it,_ the Trio straddles odd-time signa— .

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Thursday, October 14, 1993

ture compositions with a bop attack.

In 1992 Knitting Factory Works, named after the New
York club where Chapin plays frequently, released two
CDs by the trio, Anima and Third Force. This year saw
the release of Insomnia, where the band was augment-
ed by two trumpets, two trombones and a tuba.

On both the discs Chapin’s tone has a sharp, piercing
sound similar to hard-bop saxophonist Jackie McLean.
His compositions swoop back and forth between time
signatures, occasionally going off into free territory,
only to jump back to the starting point without loosing
your ear. ’

Some of the music gets raucous, but Chapin likes to
vary things. “Little Machines” from Anima starts off with
a minute of instruments colliding with whistles, ray gun
and a laff box. All this comes after “Native Green,” a
tranquil ballad on which Chapin plays ﬂute.

Chapin likes playing calmer things as much as the
wilder material. In fact, he recorded a set of standards

earlier this year with jazz veterans Ronnie Matthews

At least central New York

“The community of central

Pasqualoni said. “The coaches
and players had other expecta-
tions though.”

But a 5-1-1 start was not one
of them. _

I A . . THE prrr NEWS, PREGAME, ‘Thursday, October 14_,_1£9§_
looks to regroup after shakyseptember

A Syracuse football team

minded Cincinnati. It took a
Graves-led rally to pull the
Orange out of a jam.

A week later Graves again
tried to coordinate a last-
minute score to defeat Boston
College. But his late drive
ended in an interception and a
Boston College win.

The early problems, howev—'
er, are not centered around
Heisman-hopeful Graves. It has
been the Syracuse defense tak-
ing much of the blame.

“I think Marvin has played
very well,‘ he is in the best con-
dition of his career,” Pasqualoni

said; “But we are not playing as /,

well as we need to on

defense.”

Did Pasqualoni say defense?

 lsn’t this the defense with tal-

f ented

 Mitchell and Pittsburgh native

«; Ernie Brown at tackle? Yes it is.
' But one ingredient is missing.

nose guard Kevin

“We really miss Danny

' Conley,” Pasqualoni said of his

senior linebacker. “He has been
the heart and soul in the mid-
dle of our defense, and we still

i haven’t gotten over.that.”

Conley, who has been both-
ered by a painful knee
throughout his collegiate

: career, injured it again in the

preseason and has undergone
reconstiuctive surgery.

With the quick Conley out,
the Orangedefense has been
susceptible to the run.

Ranking ‘sixth in the Big East
in rush defense (159 yards per
game), Syracuse has allowed
seven, touchdowns on the
ground this season.

Evidence to the troubled run
defense comes through the

Syracuse tackle charts. Two of

the Orange's top tacklers are
Bryce Bevill and Bob
Grovesnor —— defensive backs.
The defensive secondary,
though letting up an average of
196.4 yards per game, is rated
second in the Big Eastand has
picked off five passes so far.
The offense, on the other
hand, has been doing just fine.
“We have a lot of bright
spots on offense,” Pasqualoni
said, while praising wide
receiver Shelby-Hill. '
That offense, of course,
includes Heisman candidate
Graves. But many wonder if he
still is in the Heisman race?
“There is still a lot ‘of talk
going around,”. Pasqualoni said
of Graves’, Heisman attention.
“It’s still circling at Syracuse,
and [Marvin] is still answering a
lot of questions.”
That quote translated —
downtown Syracuse is still
looking at its billboards.

Byjason Brame
Asst. Sports Editor

Last Saturday the Pitt
Panthers went into Notre Dame
Stadium looking for respect
after one of theirbest perfor-
mances of the season, a 29-7
loss to the Louisville Cardinals.

‘Pitt played the first half tough
but ended up losing.

Bad.

Words can’t "really describe
the sights.

“I don’t expect to be in the
fourth quarter and  when
you don’t make a first .down in
the second half, there’s not
much to talk about,” Pitt head

coach Johnny Majors said.
V Aside from the loss, which
was pretty expected to say the
least, the Panthers mixed vital
signals that were already pretty
confusing. _
Sophomore quarterback John
Ryan, a starter for most of the
year, was replaced by rookie
Pete Gonzalez, who was
expected to be redshirted this
year. 2

Ryan, confused and bewil-

" dered at the replacement, stat-

ed that he expected to miss
series not halves. He is expect-
ed to start, but who’s going to
see the majority of the playing
time? ’

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

 

And, as the “Young and the
Restless”’ Danny Romelatti
once crooned, where do we go
from here? _ -

“I don’t expect [Gonzalez] to

‘ play mistake—free, but I expect
_ him to play for the rest of the

year,” Majors said. “He really
got baptized [at Notre Daniel.”

Oh.

OK, who are the receivers
then, and is former QB Ken
Ferguson not battling for a
starting spot?

“We’ll work him at both posi-
tions,” Majors said. “He’s had a
good attitude about it.”

I963 Pitt

By Stephen Flinn
Staﬁ‘ Writer

The 1993 season marks the
30th anniversary of the great
1963 University of Pittsburgh
football team that compiled a

’ 9-1 record.

The Panthers’ only loss that
season came on a trip to
Annapolis to face Navy in the
fifth week of the season. The
Midshipmen, who were led by
Heisman Trophy quarterback
Roger Staubach, beat Pitt 24-12.

The Panthers climbed to
number three in the polls that
year with victories over some
formidable opponents —
including home wins against
Penn State and West Virginia
and road victories‘ at Notre

footballteam return

Dame, UCLA and Miami.

“Boy, it was a good year,”
Rick Leeson, former starting
fullback and current Pittsburgh
dentist, said. _

However, recapping the
bowl game the Panthers went
to that year takes only three
words — there was none.

Despite the great 9-1 season,
the Panthers found themselves
at home on New Year’s Day
due to a series of strange cir-
cumstances. '

Pitt wanted to play Texas for
the national championship. But
since Navy had already beaten
Pitt, the Cotton Bowl opted for
a matchup between nu1nber-
one Texas and the number
two-ranked Middies.

Navy lost the game 28-6,

leaving Texas as the national
champion.

“Navy traditionally never,

chose to go to a bowl, but that
year they decided to go to the
Cotton bowl,” team captain Al
Grigaliunas said.

The Panthers were also con-
sidered for the Orange Bowl,
but_bowl officials chose to wait
for the outcome of the Pitt-
Penn State game before select-
ing the Panthers. This would
have posed no problem had
the Pitt-Penn State game been
played on its originally sched-
uled date, but, in one of the
most cataclysmic days in histo-

ry, President Johnf. Kennedy.

was assassinated, and the game
was postponed.

“We were preparing for Penn
State and going through our
normal ritual of attending a
movie the night before the

game. We came out of the
movie and were told that the
president was killed,” Ray
Conley, now an Aspinwall
restauranteur, said. _

Orange Bowl officials chose
Auburn to face Big Eight cham-
pion Nebraska.

Pitt Athletic Director Frank
Caiyer, wanting Pitt to play for
a possible national champi-
onship, turned down bids to
the Liberty and Gator-bowls.

The Panthers were ' also
offered a Sun Bowl bid after
their victory over Penn State,
but disappointed Pitt officials
turned it down.

“There was no meeting
between the players to vote on
whether to accept the Sun
Bowl bid,” Grigaliunas said.
“Carver and [Pitt Coach]
Michelosen decided not to
accept the Sun Bowl bid.”

Some disappointment -was
also felt by Panther players on
not going to a bowl. ~

“We, as seniors, were some-
what disappointed, but we
were «more feeling for the
younger players who never had
the opportunity to go to a
bowl,” Conley said..

But these players all agreed
that many good lessons were
learned that 1963 season —
lessons that the players were
able to take with them the rest
of their lives, such as the
importance of academics along
with teamwork, fighting spirit
and persistence.

“I have a lot of good memo-
ries from that year,” Grigaliunas
said. “We had some good
comeback victories that season,
victories that taught me never
to_ give up. We were very goal-
oriented both athletically and
academically. I learned the
importance of good work ethic
and a positive mental attitude.”

Leeson agreed with

Grigaliunas on the good mem-
ories experienced that year and
in the stressing of academics,
as well as athletics, by Pitt“s
staff. .
“We were number three in
the country. We were a good
team — both athletically and
academically,” he said.

Conley also brought up the
importance of academics, along
with other lessons he experi-
enced that year.

“I learned that you don't get
anything for free,” he said.
“You have to work hard and
prepare to succeed. Education
was put ahead of football for
us. We had people in dental
school  medical school.

Martha summed up the
lessons he learned from Pitt’s
1963 season as being useful his
entire life.

“We had a difficult schedule,
and we had to go to class," he
said. "What I really learned
from that year was that as you
go through life, you face cer-
tain situations that are adversar-
ial  and you have to learn to
get over those difficult things.”

Pitt Rugby hits the playoff

I A I P-7
trail versus Slippery/Rock

The Panthers neea’ wins over the Rocle, winner of Penn State- W VU Saturday to advance" to Mz'a’west’s

. By Brett Fondrk
V Staff Writer

A long season of rugby has
come down to a single after-
noon. Pitt faces Slippery Rock
University Saturday at the
Allegheny Rugby Union
Championships. The winner
will advance and the loser will
head home.

The winner will have the

unfortunate task of facing the

loser of the Penn State-West A

Virginia game. The Panthers
will have to win both games to
gain a berth in the Midwest
Championships.

Pitt has never beaten SRU,
including two losseslast year.
Nevertheless, the players feel
that this year will be different.

“We’ve worked too hard to
have our season end so quick-

ly,” Adam Brennan said. “The
guys want another shot, at
WVU.”

The players don’t seem wor-
ried about the prospect of hav-
ing to win two games in one
day to advance.

“We match up well with all
the teams,” Dan Talbert said.
“We have the depth andIlead—
ership that it takes to win two
games.”

Pitt also has one of the better
defenses.

The Panthers have not
allowed‘ a try all season. The
only points that they have sur-
rendered have come from
penalty kicks.

“Our defense_is one strength

of our team,” Talbert said. “If

Ewe can hold our opponents to
penalty kicks, we’ll be tough to
beat.” '

Strong defense, leadership
and depth, a combination that
has worked since day one.
These traits have carried the
rugby club through a successful
regular season.

But in the playoffs, regular
season accomplishments mean
little.

“This is what we’ve been
working for since the first day
of practice. We’ll be fired up
and ready to play Saturday,”
Brennan said.

Let’s hope so because
nobody remembers who finish-
es second. .

Nirvana
In Utero
Geffen

Remember Nirvana? Yeah,-

that grungy band from Seattle
— the ones that-wore the ﬂan-
nel stuﬂ", and sang about hav-
ing teen spz‘rit,and had that lit-
tle baby on its cover, and had
that cool video with the cheer-
leaders and that bass guy hit
himself in the head with his
guitar on MTV. Wow, that
album was great. I wonder
where that group went?

Everybody has got a copy of
Neuermind — Nirvana’s second

album and worldwide smash -
stored somewhere in their col-
lection. Hell, in one of its
“She’s-still-a-kid” shots, CBS

showed Kristi Yamaguchi

warming up before one of her
performances at the 1992
Winter Olympicsllistening to
“Smells Like Teen Spirit.” -

It was the band’s second
release of its as—yet—brief career,
following a Sub Pop—recorded
collection called Bleach which
was neither successful nor
acclaimed.

But with the group’s world-
wide success came something
that was foreign to its members
— notoriety.

It was a such a radical step,
from recording a $600 album to
landing on MTV and Rolling
Stone, that the band —— front-
man Kurt Cobain especially —

But now with its fourth
release (or third, depending on
how you classify Insesticide, the
.‘92 mix of old B-side and unre-
leased stuff — incredible, to say
the lease) the band embarks
upon a path that will most deﬁ-
nitely not play to the masses as

had its own little bit of trouble mdid Nevermtnd. This is much

dealing with “it” — the intense
and constant status, public and
private, that comes along with
being a bona fide rock star.

“I really miss being able to
blend in with people,” Cobain
said. “It’s just been lately that I
could even handle being recog-
nized.”

“It’s a load of sh— on Kurt’s
mind that he doesn’t deserve,”
drummer David Grohl said in an
interview with Spin magazine.

less poppy and a little more nar-
row in its scope.

The problems of public atten-
tion and self—doubt reveal them-
selves in the group’s newest
release — In Utero — taking the
band down a much darker path
than any of its previous record-
ings. It doesn’t possess that one

 

marketable single — that one
“Smell Like Teen Spirit” — but,
as a whole, stands as Nirvana’s
most outstanding work to date.

Bar none.

Cobain’s musician’s contempt
for publicmedia surfaces in the
first track of the album. “Serve
The Servants” is a "Chris
Novoselic, bass-driven attack of
“self—appointed judges” who
“judge more than they have
sold.” '

Cobain’s wife Courtney Love,
riot grrrl and lead singer for the
band Hole, has also been a tar-

defended by Cobain: “If she
ﬂoats then she is not/A witch
like we had thought/A down
payment on another/One at
Salem"s lot.”

Its bravest and perhaps best
track.on the album is “Rape
Me,” a song the group has
included in live shows and ben-
efits for a while. It’s a powerful,
moving song of strength and
resilience on a topic that Cobain

involved with. (On the inside
cover of Insesticide, in a letter
from “Kurdt” to the world, he
writes, “Last year a girl was

burn.”

Nirvana’s first release off the
album, “Heart—Shaped Box,” is
simply a Cobain-inﬂuenced love
song without much depth other
than a couple of pretty imagina-
tive images. “I was drawn into
your magnet tar pit trap/I wish I
could eat your cancer when you
turn black/Broken hymen of
you highness I’m left
black/Throw down your umbili-
cal noose so I can climb right
back.”

Cobain attacks those bands in
Seattle who have ditched their
roots after hitting it big, singing,
“It’s so relieving to know that

, you’re leaving as soon asyou

get paid/It’s so relaxing to hear
that you’re asking wherever you

_get your way,” in “Frances

Farmer Will Have Her Revenge
On Seattle.”

“Pennyroyal Tea” is another
hippy, self—anguish tune to a
Novoselic/Grohl beat. “Give me

A a Leonard Cohen afterworld/So

I can sigh eternally,” Cobain
sings. “I’1n so tired ‘I can’t
sleep./I’m a liar and a thief.”

The disk concludes with “All
Apologies,” a slower tune prob-
ing Cobain"s self-frustration and
hopelessness.

“What else should I be/All
Apologies/What else can I
write/I don’t have the
right/Everything is my fault/I’ll
take all the blame/Aqua
seafoam shame.”

Neither genius nor ground-
breaking, this format-has been
done by others. In Utero won’t
rock the music world off its
axis.

But it is another step along
the road for one of the better
bands to come out of the much-
ballyhooed Seattle scene, and
just maybe, the band’s triple-A
season before next year’s sea-
sonal breakthrough.

Continued from page S-7
that’s what we wanted the
music to be like,” guitar/bassist
Myles Boisen said. “Painterly
but kind of bloody. We envision
it as half-Pollock and half-
Peckinpah.”

Don’t worry if you’re not up
on your film or art history.
Splatter Trio’s music is based on
quick themes that could sound
appropriate in the hands of a
group like the Minutemen if
they had played straight jazz.
The band claims influences
ranging. from Anthony Braxton
and Charles Mingus to Burt
Bacharach.- ,

Along with Boisen, who plays
a double-necked guitar and
bass, the band features Gino
Robair (who played with
Braxton) on drums and Dave
Barrett on saxophones. The
1990 debut on Rasta-scan crams

The disc, whose cover paro-
dies the design of old Atlantic

‘side by side with brief improv
pieces which go on just long
enough to keep your attention.
Last year’s Anagrams contin-

But when the Splatter Trio

set will take on a new dimen-
sion. Barrett is currently away in
Europe,'so Water Shed’s Ben
Opie will sit in with the band.
Wliat the band will play is any-
one’s guess. But whatever it is,
it ought to be a high-powered
set. '

Can't wait anymore

Automatic and semiautomatic weapons are creating
an environment "where criminals -control the streets, and
law enforcement officials find it increasingly difficult to

_ not only .protect themselves but protect the common

citizen, Pittsburgh included.

The issue of controlling the proliferation of guns in
America has been a hot" topic over the last several years.
The Brady Bill, vetoed by President Bush, would have
been a step in the right direction. Among other things,

the bill would have mandated _a seven-day waiting peri-

od for those wanting to purchase a gun, in order to
complete a background check on the person.
But unfortunately, the National Rifle Association

. wields such a great deal of power in Congress that no

real change seems to be on-the horizon in the foresee-

_ able future. The number of homicides will keep going

up, and the little sense of security left for residents of
the cities will disintegrate.

It is getting to the point where local officials, who are
the ones that deal with the problem everyday, are tak-
ing action on their own, not waiting for the lethargic
Congress to do something to stop the killing.

Pittsburgh City Councilmember Jack Wagner is one of
those local officials. Wagner introduced a bill in council
this week that would outlaw all semiautomatic and
automatic weapons in the city of Pittsburgh. The bill
would also ban the sale of ammunition to anyone
under the age of 18 and will require those over 18 to
provide identification. Gun shop owners in the city

-would also have to keep _records of the names and
2. addresses of those who purchase ammunition. This will

aid law enforcement officials in investigating crimes.

.“Ivam- sick of the senseless killing of citizens of all
ages, and particularly the young people  16-, 17- and
18-year-olds being gunned down before they have
experienced life,” Wagner was quoted as saying in the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. _

Wagner’s idea "was patterned after a similar "proposal
in the city of Philadelphia this past June. The
Philadelphia case‘ is being taken to court by gun advo-
cates because, according to the Pennsylvania
Constitution, municipalities are prevented from enact-
ing gun—control legislation such as this. Currently the
state legislature has the authority to regulate the posses-
sion of firearms.

City officials expect that Wagner’s bill will be opposed
by similar organizations opposing the one in
Philadelphia. According to the Post-Gazette, groups
such as the NRA and the Allegheny County Sportsmen’s
League are already lining up for a fight.

The Pennsylvania and U.S. constitutions never meant
semiautomatic and automatic weapons when the right

_to bear arms was given to citizens. The problem is get-

ting out of hand, and hopefully the actions of Jack
Wagner and officials like him will send wake-up calls to
Harrisburg and Washington, D.C.

Pro-abortion advocate distorts truth

This is written to respond to
the ill-informed remarks of the
co-president of the Campus
Women’s Organization.
Perhaps Bianca Stoner should
check the facts, or even consult
her pro-abortion allies, before
making accusations. Ms. Stoner
claims the ghastly “D and X”
abortion technique is illegal.
The June 18, 1995, letter from
the National. Abortion

Federation to its members out— ‘-
lines guidelines for discussing .

the matter of the “D and X”
abortion. Number one among
the points is “Don’t apologize:
this is a legal procedure.”

Ms. Stoner also claimed the
so—called “Freedom of Choice
Act” does not mandate a policy
of abortion on demand for

every state in the country, from‘

the moment of conception until
the moment of birth, for any
reason, even for sex selection.
Abortion advocates hide behind
bogus clauses in the FOCA to
try to deceive the American
public into thinking that the
FOCA would allow the states to
place limits on abortion. In the
July 5, 1993, edition of the
American Medical News,‘ which
is the official publication of the
American Medical Association,
the real impact of the FOCA is
discussed. “The proposed law

-would allow abortion for any

reason until viability. But it
would leave it up to individual

' practitioners — not the state -

to define that point.” Ineffect,
FOCA’s apparent ban on late-
term abortions is not a ban at
all, because the state cannot
define the age in which it is ille-
gal to kill the child. Incidentally,
the New York law banning late-

, term abortions, under which

Stephany
Pritchett

abortionist Dr. Abu I-Iayat was
prosecuted for tearing off the
arm of abortion survivor Ana
Rosa Rodriguez,’ would be null
and void under the FOCA.

Ms. Stoner claim there is no
such thing as a “D and E” abor-
tion technique. The “D and E”
abortion technique (which
stands for dilationand evacua-
tion) is similar to. the “D and C”
abortion in that the child is
killed by dismemberment in the
womb. The “D and C” is accom-
plished by
using a loop-shaped knife
called a currette to tear the
child’s body into pieces before
removing the baby from the

womb. This p1'OC(i‘ClL11‘€ does not
work as.well after the 12th
week of pregnancy because the
baby’s bones have become
stronger and more calcified.
The “D and E” abortion adds
forceps to the abortion tech-
nique to help twist and tear
away the baby. Often times the
head mustbe crushed with the
forceps to reduce the size for
withdrawal from the womb.
The Cincinnati abortionist Dr.
Martin Haskell coined the term
“D and X” (dilation and extrac-
tion) to distinguish it from the
standard “D and E.” In the “D
and  abortion the child is
removed from the uterus intact,
except for the head, and then
killed. Ms. «Stoner may want to
read about “D and  and “D
and X” further in the National
Abortion Federation 1992 Fall
Risk Management Seminar’s
official documents.

It’s time to cut through the
lies and euphemisms of_the
pro-abortion advocates. Once a

.woman is pregnant, she already
has a child. The choice is what.

to do with it. Although the
word “choice” sounds so posi-
tive and good, the choice in this
issue is whether to have a live
child or a dead child.

Public Relations Director of

LETTERS

Column on Mideastpeace incomplete

Bryan Bender’s editorial in the Sept. 28 issue of
The Pitt News raised quite a few eyebrows (my

own included) among Pitt students familiar with

the conﬂict in Palestine. Mr. Bender attests that it
is “hard to swallow” that Yasser Arafat is a “ter-
rorist-turned-peacemaker.” What Mr. Bender
fails to realize is that Israel consistently out-
classed the Palestinians in the use of terror
throughout its.turbulent history. During Middle
Eastern terrorism’s heyday, between 1967 and
1982, 282 Israeli civilians were killed by all acts
of terrorism combined. On July 17 to 18, 1981,
Israel killed well over 300- Arab civilians in a sin-
gle bombing raid in Beirut. The incident was, of
course, a textbook example of terrorism, as its
purpose was to coerce the Lebanese into dismiss-

ing the PLO from Beirut, and later culminated
into a full-scale invasion. Terrorism began in
earnest in the Middle East with the massacre of
250 Arabs in the village of Deir Yassin by the
Irgun in April 1948, in which men, women and
children were mutilated and raped.

Mr. Bender interprets the massive exodus of
Palestinian civilians out of Palestine due to this,
and other massacres as a refusal to live side by
side with the Israelis. You might say that. In the
following years, many acts of terrorism were jus-
tified by the Palestinians as retaliation for the
Deir Yassin massacre, though none ever matched
its magnitude.
