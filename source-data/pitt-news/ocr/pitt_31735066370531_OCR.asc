Freeman seeks chancellor job

David Zafris

 News Editor

Pitt Executive Vice President Jack
Freeman has been chosen by a
search committee to be recommend-
ed for the position of chancellor at
the University of Maine, according to
university sources there.

Freeman was in Maine late last

. week, and was unavailable for com-

ment upon return. The chancellor
selection committee is said to be
awaiting Freeman's decision.
Freeman is expected to make his
decision later this week.
According to an article in The
Bangor Daily News in Maine,
Freeman was the leading candidate
from a list of over 100 nominees for
the position. Chancellor Patrick
McCarthy has announced he will

‘*7 resign in August.

 Mary Ann Aug, director of News

and Publications at Pitt, said she.

knew Freeman’ was being considered
for the Maine position, but would not
confirm that he has been selected.

FIJIs.lose I
trophy to
Delta Sigs

David Zafris

News Editor

Delta Sigma Phi has been given the

aizecond place trophy in the Greek
Week fund raising competition after '

a mistake was found in the counting
of the point totals. FIJI originally
finished second, but had to give up
their trophy when Delta Sigma Phi
ca||ed_for a recount.

The error was found
recording of the first blood drive, and
FIJI member George Quay was in
charge of tabulating the point totals
for that competition. Points are
awarded to the fraternities based on
the percentage of how many
members give blood.

”The ‘Delta Sigs’ turned in the
roster of their members

originally,” said Andy Smith, direc-
tor-of student activities. ”They had in-
active people on their roster, more
people than they actually had. When
the final results came in, their
percentage of donors was lower than
it should’ve been. That's what caused
the mix-up.” 1.
But Delta Sigma Phi members have
questioned whether the FIJI members
I purposely counted the points wrong
in order to secure second place for
their fraternity. With FIJI finishing

The chancellor selection
committee is said to be
awaiting Freeman's deci-
sion. Freeman is expected
to make his decision to ac_-
cept the position later this
week.

She declined to guess as to who
would fill Freeman's position at Pitt
if he were to leave. ’’I doubt if anyone
would speculate about that at this
point,” she said.

If Freeman chooses to accept the
post in Maine, the recommendation
will be reviewed on May 19 by the
University of Maine's board of
trustees.

Freeman was also under serious
consideration for the position of
president at the University of Wiscon-
sin last fall. Sources there reported
that he was one of three finalists from
about 150 nominees. Kenneth Shaw,

former chancellor of the University
of Southern Illinois, was eventually
named to the position.

The 54-year-old Freeman serves as
the chief administrative, financial and
planning officer at Pitt. His primary
duties are the management of the
university's operations in the areas of
budgeting, human resources, securi-
ty, computing services, physical
plant, intercollegiate athletics and stu-
dent services.

Born in Fort Worth, Texas,
Freeman received B.A. and M.A.
degrees in political science from
Baylor University and his Ph.D. from
Pitt. Freeman served as a career of-
ficer in the United States Air Force,
holding positions as Assistant to the

Deputy Undersecretary of the Air ‘

Force for International Affairs, and a
member of faculty at the U.S. Air
Force Academy.

In ‘I967, Freeman was appointed
Executive Assistant to the Chancellor
at Pitt. He also served as President of
the Pitt-Johnstown campus before
assuming his current position in
1979.

ZBT nationals plan
local reorganization

Kathy Stahl

News Editor

Pitt fraternity Zeta Beta Tau has
been shutdown for the summer and
will undergo reorganization in the
fall. The action taken was initiated by
the fraternity’s board of trustees, na-
tional officers and former members.

”There have been a lot of problems

recently within the fraternity,” said .

Ken Simon, a national officer and
district governor for the Pittsburgh
area. ”ZBT has been around for 25
years and the past four or five have
not been up to par. In the past year
and a half I've spent all my efforts at
Pitt. We simply felt that we had to
reorganize or in the long run the
chapter would eventually close.
There was no effort being made to in-
crease the number of brothers. The
fraternity.became simply a rooming
house.”

The university was also aware that
the fraternity was having problems.
”We had some indication that it was
not healthy,”said Andy Smith, direc-
tor of student activities. ”The' beds
weren't filling up. Housing had to put

other non-fraternity members in the

house.”
Simon said there were other
problems beside the lack of

members. ”A fraternity is also about

camaraderie. There should be social
functions, and this appeared to be
lacking. I have trustees who were
willing to help,” said Simon. ”We
planned a Super Bowl party last fall.
We told the brothers that we would
supply color televisions and soda but
the whole thing laid an egg.

”At the meetings I would make
suggestions to them and they were
never followed through,” said Simon.
”You only get what you put into it.”

The current members have been

promoted to an alumni status but
there will still be new recruitment in
the fall. ”The current brothers will not
be associated with the new brothers,”
said Simon. ”If an old brother wanted
to come back in, it would be up to
the new group, but I'd be suprised if
any came back.”

The ZBT fraternity house will be
used by the university in the fall and
winter terms to house non-fraternity
students, but the reorganized frater-
nity will have access to it.

”We_ still own the first floor and we
may have functions there,” said
Simon. ”We will work with the resi-
dent assistant at the house and the
university who has been very kind to
us.”

A few of the old ZBT brothers were
not pleased by all of the changes.
”When some of the brothers found
out, they took out their frustration by

"spray painting a couple of walls,”

said Smith. ~”They thought that the
fraternity belonged to the national.”

Housing, along with Greek advisor
Bridget Guernsey, talked to the
members and explained that the
house is owned by the university and
that the fraternity would be held
responsible for the damages. ”After
they heard this they repainted the
walls, and this has been the only
damage reported,” said Smith.

No fraternity brothers could be
reached for comment. ’

’’lt’s not that the old brothers
weren't good members, but changes
had to be made. We are bringing in

somebody to do the recruitment in I

the fall who has had success
elsewhere and I'm hoping for the
best. I am looking foward to a new
beginning, to new people,” said
Simon. "It's unfortunate what hap-

pened but I'm proud to be a ZBT.

member and I want something to re-
main at Pitt.”

WASHINGTON —— A University of
Pittsburgh Distinguished Service Pro-
fessor was confirmed yesterday by
the Senate as the new head of the
country's space agency. The 89-9
vote clears the way for James Fletcher
to once again lead NASA. Fletcher
was the NASA director during the
19705, and while President Reagan
has praised Fletcher's leadership,
some critics contend he is responsi-
ble for many of NASA’s current prob-
lems. Among Fletcher's critics are
Sen. William Proxmire of Wisconsin
and Sen. Thomas Eagleton of
Missouri. NASA has had three major
setbacks this year: the Challenger
disaster; a Titan missile explosion on
the launch pad; and a Delta rocket
being destroyed after a main engine
failure. Investigators said that all three
may be the result of poor manage-
ment during the 19705, when Flet-
cher was director of the agency.

Terrorist threatens
the United States

Palestine — The Palestinian fugitive
Abbas, who admits to being behind
the hijacking of the Achille Lauro,
called President Reagan ”the leader
of national terrorism.” NBC agreed
to the interview on conditions that

as

they not reveal his whereabouts. Ab-
bas labeled President Reagan
”enemy number one” and said that
he will launch attacks inside the
United States to get back for the Lib-
yan invasion. Reagan shrugged off his
threat and condemned NBC for grant-
ing the interview and not revealing
his whereabouts. Leon Klinghoffer,
an American, was shot to death, and
his body was thrown overboard by
terrorists on board the Achille Lauro
last year.

Tokyo Summit ends

TOKYO —- The Tokyo Economic
Summit ended with President Reagan
describing the three-day affair as ”ex-
tremely successful.” The president
said that he was especially pleased
with the forceful wording of a warn-
ing to Libyan leader Moammar
Khadafy. All seven nations at the
summit approved the warning and
agreed to take stronger measures to
help stop terrorism. The nations also
agreed to take steps to make the
world currency market more stable.
President Reagan had complained at
the summit that the dollar fluctuates
too much against many currencies,
particularly that of Japan. At press
time, President Reagan was prepar-

ing to ‘address the nation on his
thoughts about the summit.

Israel said yes
to Star Wars

Israel — Israel announced it will
take part in the Star Wars missile
defense program. Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin and U.S.
Defense Secretary Caspar Wein-
burger signed an agreement at the
Pentagon which calls for Israeli par-
ticipation in the Strategic Defense In-
itiative program. Rabin said that Israel
considers the defense system ”a pro-
ject of great interest to the free
world.” Sources said Israel's role will
be to research non-explosive
weapons and ways to counter short-
range missiles. An Israeli official said
that 29 firms have already submitted
proposals for Star Wars.

Arms talks set to
begin on Thursday

GENEVA, Switzerland —— A new set
of arms talks is scheduled to begin
Thursday, and both sides are already
trading verbal accusations. Yesterday,
the chief U.S. negotiator, Max
Kempleman, said that the Soviet
Union encourages terrorism. His
remark was made in response to
earlier charges by the chief Soviet
negotiator Victor Karpov. Karpov said
that the bombing of Libya by the
United States was ”open|y aimed at
escalating tensions and heightening
the military threat.” Karpov also said
that Washington is to blame for the

Kempleman pointed out, however,
that the Soviets invaded Afghanistan
and said that Moscow is in no posi-
tion to act outraged over U.S. actions. .

Prof warns of tanning dangers  

By Jill Carell

For The Pitt News

Instead of basking in the hot sun for
hours, many people have discovered
a faster, easier and potentially more
dangerous way of acquiring that
golden tan which they feel makes
them more attractive: sun lamps.

No longer do people have to
escape to the beaches of the Carib-
bean, Florida or Hawaii to draw col-
or from their pasty skin. Now they
can acquire the appearance of a
healthy outdoor tan -in health spas,
tanning salons and even in the
privacy of their own homes.

Sun lamps are made to mimic the
sun. They project the same ultraviolet
rays present in sunlight, ultraviolet
alpha and ultraviolet beta rays. Ac-
cording to Dr. Alexander Silverman,
associate professor of dermatology at
the University of Pittsburgh and presi-
dent of the Pennsylvania Academy of
Dermatology, ”Ultravio|et rays are
the major factor in aging the skin,
predisposing toward skin cancer and
actually causing skin cancer.”

The difference between the sun
and sun lamps is the intensity of the
rays. Under a sun lamp, the effects
of sunbathing are achieved in a
shorter period of time. The sun has
a much broader spectrum. Sun lamps
provide a more controlled and
limited amount of UVB rays, which
are the ones that cause sunburn.

Even though the sun has a much
higher concentration of these rays,
the availability of the lamps makes
them potentially more dangerous.
The lamps provide year—round ex-
posure to ultraviolet rays in any
climate, with constant availability day
and night. ”They allow more ex-
posure to sun-like rays and cause the
aging process of the skin to be
multiplied by additional exposure,”

said Silverman. ”These are an ar— ’

tificial situation. People go to tanning
parlors to get the already filtered UVA
rays, but they still have an incidence
of increased skin cancer.”

Salvatore Puccini, owner of Puccini
Hair Design, runs a business which
operates tanning beds. Puccini's beds
contain less than one percent UVB.
He feels that because of the low
amount of UVB in the beds, they are
safer than the sun. According to
Silverman, ”UVA is what the tanning
parlors are now offering and alleging
that it is not harmful, but it is harm-
ful."

Theleffects of sun lamps are similar

to those of the sun. They dry out the
hair and skin. One still suffers from
the pain of sunburn. ”Parts of my
body that have never been exposed
to the sun really hurt from the burn,”

said one girl who has been attending

a salon.

’.’I didn't really expect to peel from
the beds, nor did I expect to freckle
like I do when I lay out,” said another

girl.

Those who do not tan and only
burn from the sun won't tan under
the lamps either. Using a sunscreen
is not practical. ”Sunscreens are

. "usually used only to allow the UVA

to pass through the skin and to block
out UVB,” said Silverman. ’’If you
pay to get a tan, then there is no use
in using a screen — why else go? For
temporarily enhanced appearance,
you pay dearly later on.”

Just as eyes should be protected in
full sunlight, they should also be pro-
tected under sun lamps, either with
goggles or shields. If eyes are ex-
posed to ultraviolet rays, the result
can be sunburned eyes, burned cor-
neas and even blindness. Exposure to

ultraviolet rays while on certain
medications, such as diuretics and
tetracyclines, can also be harmful.

. Ultraviolet rays can be beneficial
in some cases such as acne, psoriasis
and other skin rashes. “We use lamps
in hospitals and that's appropriate,
but just for the whim of enhancing
the skin color, it is a calculated risk,”
said Silverman. ”We live in a free
society where people are allowed to
abuse their bodies in any manner
they choose to,” he said. ”And these
should not be permitted.”

Under sun lamps, ifthe skin is not
already tan, a slight. red burn will
result. If it is tan, the lamps will
darken that tan. Puccini said that his
beds will give a golden coloring to
the skin. ”Beds with higher UVB can
make you turn an orangish color," he
said. ”Eight to 10 visits give a nice
golden tan, but skin type plays a role
in determining how dark one gets.

”They [tanning beds] are not in-
tended to give you a tan as though
you were at the beach for a week. It
is a cosmetic service used to keep the
skin looking healthier and more col-
orful,” Puccini said. The shop
charges between $4 to $7 per visit.
The average cost at other salons is ap-
proximately $5.

”In recent years having a tan has
been a symbol of affluence because

-1?

It

 

it means one has been in Florida or
the Caribbean," said Silverman. ”|n
Elizabethan days having a tan was a
symbol of the lower levels of society
who had to be In the sun. The upper
class avoided the sun and therefore
were as white as they could be. This
was their source of sex appeal.”

Ultraviolet rays have a damaging
effect on the skin when exposure is
carried to extremes. ”At the age of 20
one does not think about the conse-
quences. At the age of 40 they start
to think about it, and by 60 they’re
paying for it,” said Silverman.

Tanning has become a sociological
phenomenon. ”Many people think
the darker their sk-in gets, the
healthier they look, when in fact they
are really harming themselves,” said
Silverman. ”A glowing tan is a short-
lived benefit.”

Media Disaster

It's truly a shame. It's a shame that the Russian nuclear
disaster happened. It's a shame that they didn't disclose
information about the meltdown as soon as it occured.
Thousands of people may have died. Long—term effects
will haunt us beyond this century. What is the most
shameful aspect of this tragedy, however, is the coverage
it's getting in the United States.

Last week, some local disc jockies were doing the news
portion of their show. In it they gave the description of
the Russian event from Tass, the Russian news agency.
Then they gave information about the event gained by our
spy planes. Needless to say, the reports conflicted from
the time of the accident to the number of people who
perished. These discrepencies became the brunt of several
tasteless jokes. The two Dls started ripping into the Rus-
sian state with more vigor than they have doing their
wonderful show.

You may be thinking that the Russians deserve all the
abuse they are dealt. It's very easy to kick the Russians
now that they are down. Agreed, they should have told
the countries surrounding them about the volatile situa-
tion as soon as it happened, so that these countries could
prepare for the ensuing danger created by the radiation
leak. Agreed, they should have accepted Western aid
when it was offered, so further damage could be avoid-
ed. The fact remains that they didn't. That the Russians
ignored our offer of help and are attempting to keep the
disaster an internal affair, gives no one license to judge
or ridicule them.

There may be some possible good from this situation.
If we were to go through the proper diplomatic channels
to lend our expertise to our cold war foes, the immediate
problem would be helped greatly. In a bigger sense, the
problems that both nations have had with each other
might be lessened. Sure it's a risk, but it's a risk we should

take.

Abortion choice

Like many others, I am getting an-
noyed at the stupidity within the
abortion issue. I have to say that I
agree with Ms. Hal|stein’s letter about
pro-choice. I feel that Ms. Ward
should first think about what she is
saying before she sends it in and
makes herself look like a fool. I say
this because she obviously is ignorant
of the laws in the United States. To
clear this up, I would like to point out
that after [the] court case Roe vs.
Wade, a decision was made which
stated that in the first two trimesters
of pregnancy, a woman has the right
to do whatever she pleases and abor-
tion is not considered murder in com-
mon law. However, after the point of

viability, the point at which the fetus
can live on its own (approximately six
to seven months), the fetus is con-
sidered to have rights. May I also
point out that most abortions in the
first few months are due to medical
reasons. So, Ms. Ward, a fetus has no

rights as does the woman who is car-

rying that baby or as law states, a
parasite.

This does not mean I am for or
against abortion, only pro-choice as
Ms. Hallstein pointed out. Also ask
yourself this: Would you want to
carry a rapist’s baby, Ms. Ward? Even
though this violent act occurs often,
pregnancy due to it is low in percent-
age. But Ms. Ward, you have a
choice. So I urge you to think about
your thoughts before sending them
into the editor.

In a Windstorm/Mark R. Brown
Condescension: Your best weapon

Lately, the fear of being mugged is
on a lot of Pitt students’ minds. To
protect the citizens, campus and Pitts-
burgh Police have increased securi-
ty in the Oakland area, but they can't
be everywhere at once. At times, in-
dividuals have found themselves in
life-threatening situations. The stories
of fraternity folks up on the hill being
jumped by large numbers of local
kids are all too true.

One Wednesday night last January,
I was walking down Centre Avenue
with a girl I had met at my fraterni-
ty’s party. The shortest route to my
apartment included going down Cen-
tre. The sidewalks were icy, so we
walked down the middle of the
street. Then I saw them.

Fifteen local youths were walking
up the street towards us. The first
pack of them numbered six in-
dividuals, one of whom I recogniz-
ed as a member of a club—wielding
gang which I had seen up near the
VA Hospital the previous Christmas.
To turn and go back the way that we
came would only have shown our
fear — they'd be on us in an instant.
I was responsible for my friend's safe-
ty. There was only one thing to do:
go right through the middle of them.
I know how some folks like to fight
—— six or seven of them get mighty
brave when they catch an isolated

victim. Getting caught in a few race
riots in Germany taught me some
valuable lessons. Primarily, you're as
afraid of me as I am of you.

Well, dear reader, I was unarmed
in the sense that I carried no physical
weapons, but I had with me the most
effective weapon in the world —— the
human mind. I stuck my right hand
into my overcoat pocket, making a
good fist. Muggers tend to view a
hand in a pocket as a hand on a
weapon. No telling what I'm going
to pull out, right? I checked distances,
angles, momentum, traction. Who
would I clobber first, where to move
before taking out a second adversary
and so on. I maintained a conversa-
tion with my companion to put on a
veneer of calm, but my eyes searched
to determine who would fall into me
or be the first to sucker punch me.
As my eyes made contact with theirs,
mine left a message: I am an animal.
I will defend myself and my
companion. I will get at least three
of you before I go down.

The first group was around us now,
one stud coming close on my left —
he got a thousand-yard stare at a
range of three feet. He kept walking.
They waited until we were about fif-
teen feet past them, then the biggest
one of them whizzed an iceball be-
tween our heads — the provocation.
Neither of us were hit, so far, the in-

cident remained just that. However,
if I felt like dying, I could charge
uphill indignantly and unarmed.
Nope. I've got more important things
to do with my time than to throw my
life away because of street politics.

Now the second group was upon
us. They had followed 50 feet behind

the first group and numbered five in-
dividuals. It smelled as though they
were passing a joint. I kept walking,
with my fist in my pocket and my
eyes shifting. One of these kids
elected to tell me something unprint-
able about my mother. I've said
worse myself, subsequently, like a
good yuppie, I snubbed him. I'm go-
ing somewhere with my life, you'll
be a street parasite for the rest of your
life. I can't bother with every
headache that Oakland has to throw
at me. Words are words. The remain-
ing four youths in the last phalanx let
us pass by.

One may analyze the above in-
teraction from any angle that one
wishes. I received a malicous iceball
and some words. My pride is intact.
The fear that I underwent many
others experience daily. Others
receive broken bones, get shot or cut.
I'm not recomending that you yup-
pies brazen yourselves through a
pack of street kids the way I did. If
you can, just avoid them. Get used
to fear, everyone knows it.

The Ritual Dissent/James M. Crary  
Living in a dream world  and in a

Until a few days ago nobody
believed in the threat of a core
meltdown. Since it happened in the
Soviet Union, it's bound to give us
just another convenient reason to
hate the Russians. The threat won't
go away by isolating the Soviet
Union politically. Core meltdowns
will happen again, and not always in
the Soviet Union. The stupid and
obedient public will go right on liv-
ing in its dreamworld of trusting
authority.

Before the bomb, life expectancy
for this planet and its creatures was
over a billion years. Now life expec-
tancy is about one hundred years,
with luck. How could it be that in an
era of progress and technology,
which could easily build recyclable
systems for the preservation of all life
on earth, we should be wasting the
opportunity on nuclear plants and

nuclear bombs? There is an answer,
and I am going to tell it to you, for
nothing.

The reason why human civilization
is in chaos is a deep belief in the
powers of violence and human
authority. These beliefs were not
discredited by Hitler, who believed
in the superiority of some human be-
ings over others, rather than equali-

, ty before the law. These beliefs are

not being discredited by Reagan,
who believes in the superiority of
some human beings over others,
rather than equality before the law.
These beliefs are barely being
discredited by the Soviet Union, with
their belief in the superiority of some
human beings rather than equality
before the law.

There is no such thing as absolute
equality, any more than there is any
such thing as an absolute vacuum or

an absolute inch, but that doesn't
mean we should go around measur-
ing footall fields with tattoo needles,
does it? Of course it doesn't. It means
we should measure with the most ac-
curate tools available, and in justice
the most accurate tool available is the
notion of strict equality before the
law.

Prejudice of women, ethnic
bigotry, nationalism and prejudice
against the old or young only exist

“because of the vestiges of barbarism

still abided by in civilization. The
economic opportunists who have
seized Star Wars missile defense as
a lucrative source of contracts are part
and parcel of a herd pathology at
once insane and diabolical. Boy
Scouts, ROTC, the Air Force, the
Royal Navy, the Red Army, street
criminals, Hitler Youth, Chengis

Khan and Attila the Hun all represent ’

the same craving for blood that drives
Dracula from his Transylvanian cas-
tle on a warm night. There's really no
sense denying it.

in the unconscious of human be-
ings are hidden many forces. These
forces express themselves in dreams,
religious beliefs, intuitive assump-
tions and psychological jibber-jabber.
It has been speculated that sex and
violence are an interconnected
human necessity. There was a Pitts-
burgh rock band called Wargasm.
However, violence seldom takes
place between two consenting adults,
but sex usually does. To suggest that
violence and sex are synonomous on
an unconscious level is to sanction
the shotgun marriage.

The shotgun marriage has many
forms, one of which is school. Learn-
ing, which is the most natural and in-
evitable of human developments, is
generally not facilitated by forcing

kids and adults into classrooms
where they must sit still and prove
how much better they are than
everyone else. Competition doesn't
inspire human beings; it destroys
them by taking away self-motivation.

Until a few days ago nobody
believed in a nuclear core meltdown.
In another few days everybody will
forget. The Department of Energy has
no contingency plans in the event of
a nuclear core meltdown. The
Department of Defense seems to
believe that the arms race is winable.
Throughout human society and the
streets of world civilization, insanity
presides in the greatest of form and
is superior to all under God, deter.-
mined to win, prove its might, stand
tall, rule and control. The tiniest
squeaks of resistance, mercy and
kindness are treated as if living in a
dreamworld.

Frénicheco riecition :

By Deborah Kaufman
For The Pitt News

EPERNAY, France — To most peo-
ple, a visit to France is not complete
without a tour of one of the famous
vineyards that produces many of the
world’s'best wines. What better place
to begin than with the best? Cham-
pagne is a unique wine, prepared ac-
cording to the strictest regulations
which justify its reputation for being
a symbol of perfection and prestige.

The production of a champagne is
a long, complicated process adhering
to rituals and techniques at least three
centuries old. The first rule: Grapes

used must come from a specific,

region of the province of Champagne
which includes about 250 different
vineyards. Only three types of wine
are used — the pinot noir for body

nmou eouunr

and strength, the chardonnay for
finesse and elegance and the pinto
meunier for freshness and youth. The
growing process is meticulously
watched to protect the vines from the
elements and to ensure the high
quality of the grapes. The vines are
carefully pruned to deliberately limit
theyield of grapes.

The picking process begins about
100 days after the vines have
flowered, toward the end of
September. Each grape is hand-
picked and hand-inspected, and a
maximum yield per acre is fixed, all
to ensure quality rather than quanti-
ty. Then comes the pressing, which
is done both rapidly and carefully, so
that the skin of the black grapes does
not taint the juice. Four thousand
kilos of grapes produces 2,666 liters
of juice, which is divided into 13



-v-ov

casks (205 liters each). The first 10
casks are obtained in two or three
rapid pressings and are called cuvee.

Immediately after the pressing, the
juice flows into a huge vat where it
stays for 10-12 hours to allow the im-
purities to settle. Then it is placed in
casks for the first fermentation, which
takes several weeks. Throughout the
winter, while the juice becomes
wine, it is clarified and tasted by the
head cellarman. ln the spring, the
wine is made into champagne by a
very difficult process. According to
17th century principles, the cuvee is
fermented by blending the different
still wines, which may come from dif-
ferent vineyards or even different
years. The cuvee has to conform with
tradition and the reputation of the
producer. Therefore, the achieving of
a perfectly harmonious blend is a fine

art. When wines from the same year
are particularly noteworthy, the blen-
ding becomes a vintage wine or
millesime. Champagne made ffom
white grapes only, with no black, is
a blanc de blancs.

Once the cuvee is fermented, yeast
and cane sugar are added to speed
up the second fermation. This takes
place in a bottle, in cool, dark cellars
which extend for hundreds of miles
beneath the region. During the next
three years, the sugar is transformed
into alcohol and gaseous carbonic
acid, which creates the bubbles.
While all this is taking place, a
deposit is left on the side of the bot-
tle, so it is placed on a special rack
with the neck pointing slightly down.
Each day, the bottle is rotated one-
fourth and tilted downwards a little
more. Eventually, all the sediment
has collected in the bottle neck and
the bottle is completely upside down.

¢¢c«y¢9onv.u.V:‘,"."l"'~

e making  

"-‘O’ ’ *.*~.».-s.~r-urn

All that remains is to remove the
deposit -1 called degorgement. The
bottle neck is plunged into a freez-
ing solution so that all the deposit is
frozen into an ice cube and easily
removed. The amount of champagne
lost during the degorgement is
replaced by a dosage made up of a
little champagne and sugar. The
amount of sugar in the dosage deter-
mines whether the champagne is
brut, sec or demi—sec (from dryest to
sweetest)- Finally, the bottle is
”dressed” in a label proving its
authenticity.

At last, after a long aging process,
the champagne is ready to be en-
joyed. it should be served chilled, not
iced, and should never be placed in
the freezer. The best method to chill
champagne is to place it in an ice and
water filled bucket for 20-30 minutes.
Then enjoy. Champagne is the wine
of happiness.

Strindberg’s Easter offers light but lacks compassion

By Dave Zuchowski
Staff Writer

Those of you familiar with the
works of August Strindberg might be
surprised to know that at least one of
his plays, Easter, deviates from his
preoccupation with the depressive

and grey aspects of life. Strindberg,
like his Nordic compatriots, Henrik
Ibsen and Ingmar Bergman, artistic-
ly portrays the melancholia of those
long, grey Scandinavian winters. And
true, while the tone of the play
definitely has the Strindberg stamp,
Easter is a play with a light at the end
of the tunnel, a dra.m of forgiveness,
hope and renewal.

. The time setting of the play is the
end of Holy Week (Maundy Thurs-
day, Good Friday and Easter Eve).
The play concerns a family injured
by a fall from grace of their banker-
embezzler paterfamilias, whose
crimes have been discovered and
prosecuted, resulting in his imprison-
ment. The remainder of the family
painfully endures the aftermath, and
includes: the mother, who bitterly
refuses to admit the guilt of her hus-

band; the son, the troubled and
tormented scion who dearly pays

Love stories have been part of
Hollywood since it became the home
of motion pictures over 60 years ago.
Jack Fisk has brought to the screen
yet another love story, Violets are
Blue, which looks especially good
when compared to its rather poor
competition, including most recent-
ly just Between Friends.

The title of the movie seems to
have come from a child's poem
which begins: ”Roses are redNiolets
are blue .” It is a simple rhyme that
does well to characterize this film.

. The movie is a rather uncomplicated
tale of lost love and its subsequent
rekindling.

Gussie Sawyer and Henry Squires
were high school sweethearts in
1969, and then decided to go their
separate ways. The story takes place
15 years later in their hometown of
Ocean City, Md. Gussie is on vaca-
tion from her job as a free-lance

The Style Council: Have You Ever

In the words of a famous rock critic

of years gone by, ”a groove is a

groove is a groove.” This ladies and

socially for the crimes of the father;
the daughter, a saintly but deranged
jeune fille recently released from a
mental institution. The trio of unfor-
tunate souls lives constantly under
the Sword of Damocles, because at
any moment they can be evicted
from their home by their neighbor

and creditor Lundquist.
This bleak scenerio, however, con-
tains an element of warmth and com-

fort in the love pairings of Elis, the ‘

son, with his devoted fiancee
Kristina, and the daughter Eleanora,
deranged perhaps but definitely
amorously attractive to the shy, in-

very much in love) were it not for the
fact that Henry has a wife and a
13-year-old son.

Sissy Spacek and Kevin Kline are
adequate in their lead roles as Gussie
and Henry, but neither is particular-
ly dazzling. The real gems in this film
are the performances of Bonnie
Bedelia and john Kellogg in their sup-
porting roles. Bedelia portrays Kline's
loving wife who deals maturely and
intelligently with her husband’s in-

. fidelity, while Kellogg plays Spacek’s

father who owns the bumper cars on
the boardwalk and gives his daughter
insights into herself. Both performers
give credibility and life to their

‘ characters which helps to make the

entire movie more powerful.

The setting of the film is Ocean Ci-
ty — which is rather unique for a love
story -— and it works well as the small
town where all of the central
characters have grown up. The
boardwalk serves as a pleasant
backdrop to one of the happier
scenes of the movie, as Gussie and
Henry rediscover one another amidst
carnival rides and vendors. The
ocean also works well to set the

Elton John: Nikita

I thought Elton John had been
declared brain dead about 10 years
ago. You can imagine my surprise
upon hearing the glam—pop goon’s
latest hit single oozing from the
jukebox.

”Nikita” is a_ heartwarming and
tender ballad of unrequited love in
which the artist expresses his sense
of loss with class and dignity.
Whether it be the music, the video,
a gaudy get-up or the appalling
presence of teeny—bopper sissy

supreme George Michael, class and
dignity are qualities that have been
absent from Elton John's recent work.

Atlantic Starr: Secret Lovers

We've all heard this ”torn between
two lovers and feeling so inept”
theme a million times before, and we
will continue to hear it until Col.
Kadafy nukes us or 14-year-old girls
are barred from record stores.

If it weren't for the stupidity of the
lyrics and the insignificant theme, this
would have made for a cute little
heartbreaker. Unfortunately, lyrical
content is a key ingredient in this
musical genre (for example, the un-

forgettable lyrics of groups like
Smokey Robinson and the Miracles).
The plight of our two main characters
provokes no emotional response
from this cat.

A pop chameleon displa

BIG WORLD
Joe Jackson
A&M Records

By John McCombe
Entertainment Editor

Joe Jackson is unlike most per-
formers. He could have chosen to
endlessly mine the successful school
of post-punk power-pop that he
helped to popularize in the United
States. Instead, like fellow coun-
tryman Elvis Costello, Jackson has
constantly shifted musical gears, in-
corporating many diverse styles in-
cluding reggae, light funk and even
swing era big-band jazz. Joe Jackson
is truly pop chameleon.

Jackson's eighth album, Big World,
is unlike most albums. It contains fif-
teen new songs spread over three
album sides and was recorded live at
New York City's 500-seat Round-

about Theatre. In defiance ofall laws
of modern recording technique,
Jackson refused to re-mix or overdub
the master tapes. What the listener
hears on Big World is an exact
reproduction of the band's perfor-
mance during the three nights of
recording at the Roundabout.

Jackson has stepped away from the
heavily orchestrated — and highly
underrated — sound of 1984's Body
and Soul. Instead, he employs a tight
four-piece band that often suggests a
return to the sound of his seven-year-
old debut album. However, the in-
tervening years have definitely
broadened Jackson's lyrical outlook.
Big World's concerns range from a
Bernard Goetz-influenced stab at the
streets of New York in ”Wild West,”
to a belated but powerful indictment
of the British Falkland Islands fiasco
in ”Tango Atlantico.”

With this album, Joe Jackson has
proven that he is worthy of considera-
tion as one of pop’s finest composers.
Few artists would be able to match
the consistently high quality of these
compositions or the fast pace of this
eclectic collection. In one hour of
music, Jackson becomes a member
of a garage surf-punk band ”Jet Set,”
a solo pianist/balladeer ”Shanghai

pop combo ”Tonight and Forever.”

Big World is and excellent depar-
ture from the present wave of audio
sleep-aids that have cluttered the air-
waves this spring. Besides, this album
offers three sides of music for the
price of two. Any way you look at it,
Big World would make a sound
investment.

lumbering bully detailed at least
subliminally by Elis in the first act. In-
stead what we got was a thin, frail ap-
pearing character whose only source
of intimidation was his sinister and

(frightful facial expressions that vividly

projected an evil countenance not in-
herent to the character.

As far as plot and dialogue are con-
cerned, Easter is not one of Strind-
berg’s best works. The play is
somewhat heavy, but straightforward
and basically simple; definitely not
intellectually taxing or emotionally

gripping. There's a certain coolness
running throughout the play, a sur-

realistic ‘ aura with a haunting
dreaminess that prevents the realiza-
tion of a fully compassionate feeling
for the character. Still Easter has

enough redeeming qualities to merit
a trip to the theater, if merely to see
a rare American performance of one

Panthers spring intoGottfried era

By Jim U rban
Editor—In—Chief

Pitt head coach Mike Gottfried
leaned on the rather large desk in his
office on the third floor of Pitt
Stadium as the rain came down
violently outside. He had just con-
cluded his first set of spring drills as
head coach of the Pitt Panthers with
the annual Blue-Gold game. It is that
same rather large desk that Gottfried
will spend long hours behind in the
coming months trying to decipher
who plays where and why.

The Panthers finished spring drills
with an impressive defensiveunit.
The mainstays of last year's unit —
linebacker Steve Apke and defensive
end Tony Woods — return for their
senior year. That is only one reason
why the defense dominated the Blue-
Gold game. Another is a suspect of-
fensive unit.

As the Panthers suited up for the

Pitt closed out its spring practice ses:ion:with the annual Blue-Gold game on Aril .

spring finale, which was held at Pitt
Stadium on April 28, absent was the
entire starting backfield from last
season, and one starting receiver.

Tailback Charles Gladman, who
gained 1,085 yards as a sophomore
last fall, watched from the sidelines
with quarterback John Congemi and
fullback Tom Brown. All were nurs-
ing leg injuries. Also missing were
receiver Reggie Williams (leg injury)
and tailback Brian Davis (suspended
for disciplinary reasons). How do you
put a team together when 90 percent
of your offensive production is
missing?

”The real disappointment,” Gott-
fried said, ”is not in how we're play-
ing, but the fact that l have not been
able to see everybody play.”

Hopefully for him that trend will
change in the fall. There seems to be
several interesting battles heating up
for some key positions. At quarter-
back, Congemi will battle. Sal
Genilla, a record-setting junior col-
lege transfer from the College of San
Mateo in California. Both were neck’

and neck during spring drills, and it
may turn out to be a photo finish in
the fall. '

”John Congemi missing the spring
game really threw that off,” Gottfried
said. ’’In the fall, they will compete
until they get to the first game”
(against Maryland at Pitt Stadium on
Labor Day night).

Additionally, although it was very
shallow during the spring, running
back will be another area where
talent will be abundant when fall ar-
rives. Joining Gladman, Brown and
Davis, is Pitt's cross between William
Perry and Walter Payton, sophomore
Craig Heyward.

After sitting out a year for
disciplinary reasons, Heyward
reported to spring drills overweight,
but soon silenced his critics showing
that he had lost little, if any, speed
and quickness. It is quite evident that
Pitt will have to find a way to play
Heyward, Gladman, Davis and
Brown, all four with extraordinary
talents, in the fall.

Last fall, former Pitt head ‘coach

Mike Gottfried said he was especially pleased with the play of the defense.

By John Enright

Assistant Sports Editor

Spring is usually a slow time for
college sports teams, but there are
still many stories making the Pitt
sports scene, such as:

0 Last week's National Football
League draft. The draft was supposed
to. be harsh on Pitt football players
this year, but how. wrong the draft-
niks were! Defensive tackle Bob
Buczkowski, originally thought to be
a middle round pick, was selected in
the first round (24th selection overall)
by the Los Angeles Raiders.

0 Meanwhile, Panther strong safe-
ty Bill Callahan was taken in the
fourth round by the hometown
Pittsburgh Steelers. Callahan, a four-
year letterwinner, was projected as
an All-America candidate going into
last season, but he didn't live up to
expectations, making his early selec-
tion quite a surprise.

0 Three other Pitt players were not
drafted, but signed free-agent con-
tracts with NFL clubs. Offensive

linemen Barry Pettyjohn (Tampa Bay
Buccaneers) and Tony Brown (New
England Patriots) and fullback Darnell
Stone (Denver Broncos) will all at-
tend their new team's rookie mini-
camps later in the month.

0 The biggest surprise for Pitt dur-
ing draft week was the free-agent
signings of two Panther basketball
players! Yes, basketball players. For-
ward Darryl Shepherd and center
Keith Armstrong both signed pro con-
tracts last week. Shepherd, 6-6, 195,
hasn't played football since his high
school days at Peabody, but the
Atlanta Falcons will try him out as
wide receiver and possibly defensive
back. Meanwhile, Armstrong's
chances to make his team, the Cin-
cinnati Bengals, are not as slim as
people would be led to believe.
Don't forget, Armstrong was an All-
State defensive end at Michigan's Yp-
silanti High School and he was

recruited by numerous major
colleges.

0 Now that spring football has con-
cluded, head coach Mike Gottfried
has named his tri-captains for the
1986 season. They are linebacker
Steve Apke, offensive tackle Randy
Dixon and defensive end Tony
Woods. I found it’a bit surprising that
fifth-year quarterback John Congemi
wasn't chosen as a captain. Is this an
early indication of Congemi’s
standing in the quarterback race with
former junior college star Sal Genilla?

0 Despite having a rather disap-
pointing sophomore season, 6-10 for-
ward Charles Smith is one of 47
players that have been invited to the
trials for selection of a United States
National Team to represent ‘the
U.S.A. in the World Championship
Games, being held later this summer
in Madrid, Spain. The trials will give
new Pitt coach Paul Evans the oppor-
tunity to evaluate his talented big
man, as Evans is one of the trial
coaches. The trials are being held at

Foge Fazio enjoyed the same luxury
until it backfired on him at
midseason. That is when tailbacks
A.B. Brown and Eugene Napolean,
upset with the lack of playing time,
transferred to West Virginia. Gottfried
will not let that bother him, however.
”You have to have some depth,”
Gottfried said, ”because you are
always going to have injuries.”
Gottfried would not and cannot
name frontrunners at any of these
positions, but he does have an idea
of how it is going to be determined.
’’It will be decided this summer,”
Gottfried said. ”There will be some
players that work harder than other
players and ifwill show in fall camp.
’’I think we are about where I
thought we would be at the end of
20 practices,” Gottfried added. ”We
had some areas we were real con-
cerned with and we improved in
those areas. Believe me, in the fall we
are going to be a good offensive foot-
ball. Don't worry about that. When
we hit camp in August, we will be
a good football team. But it will take

Colorado Springs, Colo. from May
15-19.
0 Speaking of Evans, he has signed

his first two recruits. They are 6-8‘/2

forward Chris Gatling from Elizabeth,

N.J. and Jimmy Rodgers, a 6-1 point
guard from Brunswick Junior College
in Georgia. Gatling, who played on
the same high schoolteam as Panther
guard Mike Goodson, averaged 17.3
points per game and 13.5 rebounds
per game, while blocking 111 shots
his senior season, leading his team to
a 24-4 record. The Panthers are in
desperate need of a point guard for
next season, if Goodson can't do the
job. So Evans went out and signed
Rodgers, a solid junior college
playmaker. Rodgers averaged 1 1.5
ppg and 9.2 assists per game this past
season, as his team won the Georgia
Junior College Championship for the
second year in a row. The signings
bring the total of new incoming
players to five. Evans has one scholar-
ship still available, but he has said
that he will save it for next year.

°This past weekend Villanova

that time between now and then to
get us there.”

Gottfried said he hopes to have
about 60 players stay in Pittsburgh
over the summer, and the remainder
he will maintain weekly correspon-
dance with until the late summer,
when the Panthers enter camp in ear-
ly August. ‘

”Once we hit camp, we will have
to work fast because the first game
comes up pretty quick,” Gottfried
said. ’’I am really looking forward to
it. It is going to be very interesting.”

Spring Notes: Junior tight end
Dave Shuck injured his knee in the
early moments of the Blue-Gold

game, but it is not believed to be
serious  Junior quarterback Joe’
Felitsky separated his shoulder and
dislocated his finger in the game, but
will be ready in time for fall camp 
Sophomore linebacker Jerry Olsavsky
and redshirt freshman receiver Dar-
rin Gillaspie received the Ed Conway
Memorial Award for being named
the squad’s most improved players.

kedam (Radnor, Pa.), 6-6 ‘/2 Rodney
Taylor (Columbia, S.C.) and 6-3 Eric
Leslie (Brooklyn, N.Y.), were all

recently listed among Basketball"

Weekly’s "America’s Top 50
Prepsters For ’86.”

”We’re obviously delighted to
have these four outstanding young
men become part of the Villanova
basketball program,” remarked a
pleased Massimino. ”These four
young men are not only excellent
basketball players who will help give
us strength at the position we need-
ed it most, but they are truly outstand-
ing student athletes who will once
again represent what our program is
all about.”

Bekkedam was the first Wildcat to
announce his plans to attend
Villanova and signed during the ear-
ly signing period in November. A
Canadian native who came to the
United States two seasons ago, Bek-
kedam lived up to his pre-season
hype as the best prospect in Penn-
sylvania. Named a second-team
Parade Magazine All-America, Barry
averaged 23.2 ppg. and 10.4 rpg.
while helping Archibshop Carroll to

a 22-7 overall record. Additionally,

Carroll's all-time leading scorer cap-
tured All-State honors and was
named MVP of the Philadelphia
Catholic League and participated in
the McDonald’s All-America All-Star
game, Capital Classic All-Star game
and the Dapper Dan Classic.
Standing 7-2 and tipping the scales
at 240 pounds, Greis has the honor
of becoming the Wildcats’ tallest
basketball player ever. Averaging
24.2 ppg. and 13.2 rpg., he ended his
career as St. Anthony's all-time

writers.
x5926.

cave TO rile
AMERICAN
CANCER SOCIETY.

This space contributed as a public service

leading scorer with 1,327 career pts.
and as the all-time leading rebounder
with 797 rebs. Then Greis helped his
season's St. Anthony's squad to a
18-8 record. Named by USA Today
as a honorable mention All-America
and ranked 12th in Eastern Basket-
ba|l's list of the top 60 seniors in the
East, Greis capped his senior season
by earning All-State, All-Long Island
honors while being named the MVP
of the Long Island Catholic League
and the Long Island Catholic League
playoffs.

Leslie will supply the ’Cats with
some needed outside shooting and
versatility at the guard slot. A scoring
threat who possesses excellent
shooting range, he has strong ball
handling and passing skills and can
fill in at either guard position. Averag-
ing 31.2 ppg., 10.4 rpg. and 6.2
assists a game as his club rolled up
a 17-6 record in 1986, the Grady
High School all-time leading scorer
earned USA Today All-America
honorable mention, was selected All-
State, All-Brooklyn Division IA and
was named by The New York News-
day as its ”Player of the Year" for
both the public and Catholic league.

Vi|lanova’a fourth recruit offers

Vi|lanova’s some needed inside re-
bounding and scoring beef. Taylor
recently put the finishing touches on
an outstanding career by earning
MVP honors in the South Carolina
North—South High School All-Star
game after pouring in 23 pts. He
averaged 25.6 ppg., 14.0 rpg. and 3.0
blocked shots a game, Rodney led his
A. C. Flora High School team to an
18-5 record and the South Carolina
AAA Division State title. He was
named by USA Today as an All-
America honorable mention, earned
All-State, All-Area and All-Conference
honors and was named South
Carolina's AAA Division ’’Player of
the Year” as well as the Columbia
Area ”Player of the Year.”

Villanova, which finished the
1985-86 season owning a 23-14
record and made its seventh con-
secutive NCAA Tournament ap-
pearance, loses four members to the
1985-86 team. The ’Cats lose by
graduating the services of 6-7 stand-
out starting forward Harold Pressley
(16.8 ppg., 10.1 rpg.), starting guard
Dwight Wilbur (7.1 ppg.), 7-1 reserve
center Chuck Everson (1.7 ppg., 1.7
rpg.) and 5-10 reserve guard R. C.
Massimino (0.9 ppg.).

Plan a Great summer!

  

    

Monday, St. John's University's
Walter Berry announced that he is
quitting St. John's to pursue a career
on the moneyed courts of the NBA.
Berry, voted the John Wooden Award
this past season signifying him as col-

lege ball’s top player, would have
been a senior next year had he stayed
at St. John's.

Berry is the second Big East star in
the past four days to announce he is
leaving his college early. On Friday
Dwayne ”The Pearl” Washington
said he was passing up his final year
of eligibility at Syracuse.

In a game at Fitzgerald Field House
last January, Berry led a second-half
comeback win by St. John's tallying
34 points for the Redmen.

Originally, Berry indicated he
would remain at St. John's for his
senior year. The expected presence
of the 6-8 center led many experts to
pick the Redmen as the team to beat
in next year's campaign.

The absence of Berry and
Washington costs the Big East two
All-America performers and throws
open wide the race for the 1987 Big

tttttttttttttttttittti East Championship.
