William S. Dietrich II, a former
steel executive, philanthropist
and se1f—made businessman who
donated the largest monetary gift
in Pitt’s history, passed away on
Thursday at the age of 73.

The John A. Freyvogel Funeral
Home announced on Friday that
Dietrich died Thursday but did
not disclose the cause of his death.
Carnegie Mellon University said
in a statement that complications
from cancer contributed to his
passing.

Dietrich had many ties to Pitt. A
Pittsburgh native born in 1938, he
received both his master’s degree
and Ph.D. from Pitt.

He sat on Pitt’s Board of Trust— A

eestbeginning in 1991 and served
as the Board’s chairman from 2001
to 2003. '

Chancellor Mark Norden-
berg said in a press release that
Dietrich’s passing is a loss to Pitt’s
Board and the business and civic
communities.

“Speaking for myself, Bill was a
good friend and an inspiring role
model, as well as one of the Univer-
sity community’s favorite people,”
he said. “The impact of his extraor:

dinary generosity will be felt by

faculty and students throughout
this University for countless gene
erations to come.”

In 1960, Dietrich graduated
from Princetonand went on to
serve in the U.S. Marine Corps Re-
serve. After leaving the Marines,
he worked for his_father’s steel
company, which sold scrap metal
to manufacturers. He turned his
family-owned construction busi-
ness into Dietrich Industries, Inc.,
one of the largest manufacturers of
light metal construction framing

Of course, the zombies are liv-

the quarantine is just a joke and the

‘ settingof the next horrorblockbuster

was actually the scene at the Oct. 8
Pittsburgh Zombie Fest, which took
place on World Zombie Day.

The annual Zombie Fest began in

2007. It’s sponsored by-The It’s Alive

Show, a late—night horror program on
WBGN—CD in Pittsburgh.

Volunteer coordinator Sharon
Tryc, who was dressed in everyday
clothing, said that the event not only
serves as a fun day for the thousands
who ﬂock to Market Square, but it
also beneﬁts charities.

Tryc said that-Zombie Fest vol—
unteers, dressed in zombie garb,
collected canned goods for a local
food bank at the registration tent.
They also held a charity auction of
horror movies, T—shirts and concert
tickets, charging $1 per raffle ticket.
The proceeds from the event totaled
$250, which will beneﬁt the Susan
G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation
Pittsburgh Branch.

A variety of tents were set up to
sell zombie merchandise, including
brains on chains, mugs, dolls and
statues. Other tents offered photo
opportunitieswithbloody prop weap-

rock bands.

in the nation.

Dietrich sold the steel company
in 1996 and later used his assets to
distribute gifts to Pitt and Carnegie
Mellon, which were to receive the
donated funds upon his death.

On Sept. 22, Pitt announced that
Dietrich would donate $125 million
to the school, the largest gift in the
_,University’s history. On Sept. 28,
the Board of Trustees voted on a
resolution to rename the School
of Arts 8: Sciences the Kenneth P.
Dietrich School of Arts 8: Sciences,
in honor of Dietrich’s father.

After the announcement,
Dietrich said that he was providing
the gift for a number of reasons.
He wants to advance Pitt’s quality

_ education, continue to maintain
1, Pitt’s position as an important in-

stitution in Southwestern Pennsyl-
agvania and recognize the progress
the University‘-has made.

“As a graduate who personally

, beneﬁted from my own studies
at Pitt, I want to ensure that the
University can continue to pro-
vide educational opportunities of
the highest quality to its under-
graduate and graduate students,”
Dietrich said on Sept. 22.

Earlier in September, Dietrich
announced a $265 million gift to
Carnegie Mellon, the largest gift

 CMU’s history.

The source of the funds that will
directly beneﬁt Pitt is the Dietrich
Charitable Trust, which was cre-
ated by Dietrich’s own assets gen-

ﬁcial severed heads into abucket. The
winner of the horror scream contest
had her scream used as stock audio
for The It’s Alive Show.

Even if the point is to have fun,
participants take the event serious-
ly. People painted their skin gray or
white, ripped their clothes and spat-
tered fake blood on their outﬁts, to
sell the idea that they had become
genuine—article undead monsters.

Many people came as zombie ver-7 3

sions of archetypes, such as waiters

erated by the 1996 sale of Dietrich
Industries. The assets in this trust
will fund a new charitable organi-
zation, The Dietrich Foundation,
which will administer the funds
beneﬁting Pitt. 4

The gift will bring the Uni-
versity’s “Building Our Future

2 Together” capital campaign past

the $1.85 billion mark, edging it
closer to its $2 billion goal. The
campaign disperses ﬁinds for use
in scholarships and fellowships
and by faculty. .

Pitt spokesman Robert Hill said
at the time of the donation that the
gift would at ﬁrst be used to sup-
port the School of Arts 8: Sciences,
and scholarships and fellowships
available to students might come
at a later time. .

Sciences, said that the arrange-

ments might take a few years to I --

“Mr. Dietrich fully understood " ' A

wear what all the Saudi ladies wear.”

Kelso was very quick to give her opinion
regarding some of the common concerns
that Americans have about Saudi Arabian
culture, such as the illegality of alcohol
and female driving.

“The lack of driving is cool, because
women have a driver everywhere they go,”
she said.

In terms of alcohol, she said she did

not understand what the big deal is since
many drugs are illegal in the U.S.

After her speech, Kelso recounted some
of herother experiences, including a diffi-
cult moment back in 2003 when she visited
her brother, sister-in-law. and niece who
lived on the east coast of Saudi Arabia.

With the start of the Iraq War, many
terrorist attacks were happening through-
out the country. She said she had never

seen such hostility between Saudis and
Americans.

“Many [Saudis] believed the war was
unjust and illegal. For the ﬁrst time, I was
afraid to be in Saudi Arabia,” she said.

One day in 2003, terrorists began at-
tacking compounds near her brother’s
home. ' I

After verifying the safety of her sister-
in—law and niece, Kelso and her. brother

remained in the compound protected" by
the Saudi National Guard.

She later discovered that terrorists had
massacred a large number of victims in
nearby compounds. They rounded them
up, killed them and dragged some of the
bodies through the streets, she said.

“It was a horrible day. Soon after, we
packed our things and left with a police
escort to Bahrain where my mom lived,”
Kelso said. “I just wanted out. I just wanted
to leave.”

However, Kelso said the anger against
Americans subsided, and the government
cracked down tremendously on terror-
ism. I 0 — 5 ‘ ‘

“This was not avconsensus that we hated
Americans. The majority of Saudi Arabian
citizens were mortiﬁed at what was going
on in the country. It just took some time.
Everyone moved on and recovered from
it,” she said. '

Overall, Kelso said she enjoyed her time
in Saudi Arabia and that she will never
forget the hospitality of its people.

After the speech, the audience watched
the remaining segments of the program.
Students from the Saudi Students House
performed several versions of the tradi-
tional Bedouin dance, Al Ardah. I

The night’s events also included videos,
a fashion show and a mock Saudi wedding
during which, dressed in white, a bride
and groom began a procession on stage.
The couple soon made their way to the
ballroom for a night of activities including
henna, dress-up, photography and cal-
ligraphy. .

After the activities, Salem’s Market 8:
Grill ended the evening by serving a tra-
ditional Arabic dinner including hummus,
tabouleh salad, chicken and rice.

The event attracted people from many
Middle Eastern countries. A ,' ’

Rasha Burhanuldeen and Noora Salman,
two native Iraqis who are now students at
Pittsburgh Allderdice High School, attend-
ed Saturday’s event after hearing about it
on Facebook and seeing a ﬂier at school.
They said that, for them, the importance
of the event was that it could help combat
stereotypes of the Middle East.

“People should have an idea about the
Middle East.“Many believe that Middle
Easterners are terrorists, but an event like
the Saudi Open House is an effort to give
them an idea of peace,” Salman said. '

Maya O’Donnell, a junior anthropol-
ogy major and Arabic 3~student at Pitt,
said that the event was important for the
same reason. ,

“Many Americans have misconceptions
about the Middle East, and I come to events
like this in order to learn and ﬁght those
stereotypes with knowledge and ﬁrst—hand
experience,” O’Donnell said. I

EDITORIAL « -

Occupy Pittsburgh

underdeveloped

Pittsburgh is, now a hub of the cur-
rently decentralized Occupy Wall
Street movement.

In an editorial last week, we ap-

. plauded the movement’s use of tech—,

nology to spread its message, but
now we’re shaking our heads at the
disorganization that has bubbled up

M in several cities across the country,

including ours. _

Occupy'Wall Street essentially
stands against the greed of major
corporations, championing the
middle class. But what does Occupy
Pittsburgh advocate?

According to its website, Occupy
Pittsburgh is “currently preparing”

_ its demands, purpose and other or-

ganizational documents, which will

reflect speciﬁc problems in the re- ,

gion. But we think it shouldn’t coor-
dinate and publicize events wherrits
true purpose has yet to be deﬁned.

We have no problem whatso-
ever with civil protests, but there
is little, merit in a movement that
doesn’t even state what it stands
for. There’s noreasonto localize

a major protest if there is no local -

purpose.‘ It’s unclear exactly what
the group wants to occupy, consid-
ering that our ﬁnancial districtlis
nowhere near as large or inﬂuential
as Wall Street..

If Occupy Pittsburgh wants to
be successful and attract those who
are actually interested in change,
it should focus on major local is-

sues, like Highmark and UPMC’s'

ongoing health care war. The dis-

pute between the two medical-care ,

giants might cause people to limit

their hospital options —' or pay the _

price — in just a couple of years.

That’s just one issue in one city, but-

it affects thousands and thousand
of people. - P ‘
Highmarkand UPMC’s battle
is something speciﬁc to speak up
about, more so than vague asser-
tions about corporate greed. Cor-
porations’ products, includingthose
from computermanufacturers, vari-
ous media outlets and cell phone
providers, are —— ironically — help-
ing make the entire campaign pos-

sible. What kind of message is that

supposed to send?

At this point, Occupy Pittsburgh
is the harebrained, illegitimate child
of Occupy Wall Street and the Inter-

net. Although it causes many good,
efﬁcient thinkers to congregate and '

share ideas, the Internet is also a
lightning rod for misinformation
and misinterpretation. We think
Occupy Pittsburgh falls victim to
the latter. , I
Because of the insane, exponen-

’ tial growth of the movement thanks

to people’s interconnectedness
through the Internet, informed,
passionate protesters become dis-
placed by bandwagoners who want
nothing but to say that they were
part of the movement. This is a ﬂaw

unique to a generation rooted ‘in

technology. .
"This Saturday, Oct. 15, Occupy

' Pittsburgh plans to hold a march ,

and rally Downtown. According to
the organization’s website, “Details
will be posted as they become avail-

‘able.”e We understand that a grass-

roots approach to change can’t be

_ constructed overnight, but a plan

and a purpose is essential for an ef-
fective event that doesn’t waste its
members’ time.

The time~wastingbegins with lo-
cation. Pittsburgh is no Wall Street.

What is there to occupy? But make '

no mistake: The Pittsburgh media

will cover the event as if it is actually

accomplishing something. ~
We think Occupy Pittsburgh has

two options: It should chalk up its _ ‘

precise point of existence before
marching this Saturday, or it should
disband into smaller, more eﬁicient
groups that tackle speciﬁc issues in
the community. Without a goal, the
group’s efforts’ lead to nothing: no
change and no satisfaction.

Rather thantaking a misdirected
march onto Pittsburgh’s streets, Oc-

cupy Pittsburgh should examine it- '

self — why does it really exist? It’s
a small step, but a necessary one.
Perhaps once it actually ﬁgures out
its objectives, motives and goals, its
‘marches and rallies will have mean-
ingful tones, not just the same old
rhetoric made popular by its pre-
decessor. . ' ‘

And once Occupy Pittsburgh de-
cides what it wants to be as a move-
ment and actually applies itself to
serving as a conduit for the ideas
of the common Pittsburgh citizen,
maybe we — and others —will start
listening. I

A MIDWESTERN PIECE -

Good sci—f1 remains artistic

 

A-trip back in time would likely be a rude awakenin

" Mark Kozlowski ,

Columnist

Let’s say that you were transported_
. without warning into the 14th cen-

tury. The results would likely not
be good, '

Think about it. You wear mot-
ley, bright clothes. Your teeth are
shiny, straight and still in your
mouth. Your pocket contains a
strange device that you claim can
tell the time of day, help you com-
municate with people hundreds of
miles away and make images that
are better than any painting of a
time that hadn’t mastered the art
of perspective drawing. How does

v the device work? Somehow your
protestations that it’s all the work of

ﬂowing, charged particles inﬁnitesi-

mally smaller than the eye can see’

— and special types of light that the
eye can’t see either —. aren’t very
convincing. Clearly, these people are

not fans of science ﬁction. But the
idea that you are a sorcerer sounds

‘pretty good to them. I hope a ﬁre

extinguisher got swept back in time
with you. It’s your only hope. '
Even in the present day, many

people see science ﬁction as a genre
not to be taken seriously. This is

unfortunate, as science ﬁction al-
-lows writers the ability to explore
novel story elements and retell old
stories in new ways.

A I don’t blame people for not tak-
ing scienceﬁction seriously. There
is an awful lot of terrible science
ﬁction out there, from books that
could beused in class as examples
of hownot to write, to shows so stu-
pid even my dad — who will watch

g for inhabitants of the 21st century, but columnist
Mark Kozlowski appreciates the modern sorcerer.

If we are to move to an under-
standing of good science ﬁction,

‘ it helps to deﬁne bad science ﬁc- '

tion. Aside from general things that

there are three speciﬁc themes that
tend to crop up that are particular
to sub-optimal sci—ﬁ. First, some
authors become so enamored of
technology that technology be
comes the main character, and
sometimes the only character that
is developed at all. Second, some
technology is 17-dimensional in all
375 dimensions the work posits;
the devices might be -far-fetched
and violate fundamental lawsiiof
physics because the plot requires
it. These two points often merge to
create the Central Ignominy: of Bad
Science Fiction: the use of technol-
ogy to paper over deﬁciencies in the
underlying writing. It often befalls

Note: When I talk about psychiatric
medication in this column, I am refer-
rlngprimarily to selective serotonin
re—uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the
most commonly prescribed class of
psychiatric medications — a class
thatincludes the brand medications
Prozac and Zoloﬁ— thatare usually
prescribed for depression and anxi-
ety. At this time, I am not knowledge-
able enough about antipsychotics,
mood stabilizers orADD medication
to advise on those matters.

Here’s what I do feel qualiﬁed to
tell you.

The summer after my freshman

year, two months after I was diag-
nosed with depression and started A
seeing a therapist, I began taking an .

SSRI called Paxil. As of this writing,
I’ve been taking 25 mg of Paxil per day
for a little over a year. Although I have
no plans to discontinue its use in the

foreseeable future, I do not intend to
be on Paxil for the rest of my life.
My experience taking an antide-
pressant has been overwhelmingly,
even unusually, positive, with a quick
response and all side effects subsiding
after my ﬁrst two weeks onthe medi-
cation. However, mine isn’t the aver-
age experience with meds — frankly,
there is no average experience. Psy-
chiatry is a new, imprecise science,

— and we are all special neurochemi-
‘ cal snowﬂakes; different people have

radically different experiences on the
same drug. To go on meds is to play
Russian roulette with efficacy and
side effects, and although I believe I
made the right decision when I chose
to go on Paxil, there are many, many
reasons a sensible person might de-
cide medication isn’t the option for
 What’s important is that you ac-
tually weigh the options and make the
_ best decision you can make.

opinions about medication as atreat—

and dress up age-old questions in

person when he is presented with
control over an immensely powerful
weapon? To what extent would you
be prepared to abandon your mor-

als to ﬁght aliens hell—bent on con- .

quering Earth? What if an ordinary
human being was hailed as a god or
a messenger from the afterlife of an
alien race? How would somebody
deal with that kind of pressure?
Last, through plot devices such as
holodecks and time-travel, we can
pose some interesting questions
about our society today and how- it
would interact with the society of

the future, or that of the past. All '
e of these premises have been used,

and it is still possible to_' take unique
angles on each of them. Science ﬁc-

tion also allows us to handle con-

troversial topics in ways that don’t

hit as close to home. Many people
would be offended if a show were to
suggest that Jesus wasn’t at all in-
terested in being a religious ﬁgure.
Fewer people would beoffended
by a show with a central plotline
revolving around a human starship
captain considered a prophet by the
local aliens, much to his surprise
and consternation. _

So before we dismiss science ﬁc-
tion as artistically void, we should
realize that there is potential to
create good literature out among
the stars. .

ment option for mental illness.

' Some people feel that mental ill-
ness is ﬁrst and foremosta disease, a
physical imbalance ofbrain chemicals
that requires medical treatmentjust
like any other illness. To these people,
saying you want to treat your depres-
sion without medication is like saying
you want to treat your pneumonia
with diet and exercise. Some of these
people do work in the medical ﬁeld,
but mostlof them have simply been
inﬂuenced by the fantastic success of
afriend or loved one with medicated
recovery — or have taken the TV ads
for antidepressants abit too literally.
Popular acceptance of mental illness
as a legitimate medical condition has
been hugely beneﬁcial in that it helps
people understand that depression or
anxiety, like pneumonia, is not some-
thing one can simply “snap out of’,’ or

‘ “man up and deal with.” However,
this understanding is less useﬁil when
it leads people to conclude that if a
person is mentally ill, the solution is

Creators interview

Venezuelans for wrappers

Conflict Kitchen 4 10

terviews. Conﬂict Kitchen’s creators,]on Rubin
and Dawn Weleski, designed the informational
wrapper. They hope that the restaurant will
prompt customers’ discussions. .

“Well, I don’t know if [the food itself] has
to spark a meaningful discussion,” Rubin said.
“Butif you think about where most of the dis-
cussions you’ve had in your life have been,
they’ve probably taken place around food in
one way or another.” ,

Rubin ﬁnds himself surprised by how many
people do read the wrapper. He said diners of-
ten feel they take away more than just a meal.

’ “I think people are ready _and hungry for
more information; they’re ready‘ and hungry
for more discourse and dialogue,” he said.

This past winter, during the kitchen’s,.Af- I

ghan cycle, kitchen employee Meg O’Malley
experienced the death of a close. friend who

was serving in Afghanistan._Comments about 

the Afghan culture and people made by oth-

ers at her friend’s wake shocked her, but also '

; ,

i helped her solidifyher reasons for working at

the kitchen.

“I think it’s really important we try to un-
derstand the world better,” O’Malley said. “I
think we have a responsibility as human beings
to understand one another.”

Rubin said that although the kitchen some-
times receives criticism from both the far left
and the far right, the Pittsburgh community has
largely embraced its ideals, and he encourages

public engagement and debate. -

“Ourgoal is not to take a side on anything;’

said Rubin,A“but3to tryto create a space in our ’
city in which we can stop for a moment’ and
‘ enjoyaculture andthinkaboutthe politics that

are at stake between our culture and theirs.”

Chavez supporters difficult to find in United States

Conﬂict Kitchen 4 13

Middle Eastern cycles, the Venezuelan itera-
tion of Conﬂict Kitchen provided a challenge
for its organizers in their attempts to collect a
variety of opinions.

“Our most difficult part of the interview
process was getting pro-Chavez supporters.
It took a little longer,” Rubin said, referring to
supporters of the country’s current president,
Hugo Chavez. “Ninety percent ofvenezuelans

in the U.S. are against him, and we wanted to
get a totality of opinions that exist.”

In addition to the information found in the
wrapper interviews, customers can also learn
about the conflict from the eatery’s workers,
who are trained not just in preparing and sell-
ing arepas, but also in discussing the kitchen’s
mission.

Employees are either CMU work—study stu-

ClRO\l/JfE “DU SOLEIL

 ishares

dents or, like O’Malley, community members
or students interested in the project.

Aside from general geography, O’Malley
knew little about Venezuela before starting
work at La Cocina Arepas. As an introduction,
she and other employees watched a PBS special
called “The Hugo Chavez Show.” In September,
they participated in a live radio broadcast with
community activists in Caracas, Venezuela, via

Our conflict in
Venezuela is more
based in ideology

and political  
influencei
- Jon Rubin

the kitchen’s neighbor, The Waﬁle Shop.

She noted that one of the most interesting
things she learned from reading the interviews
with Venezuelans was the cultural importance
of beauty pageants.

“Women take extreme pride in their physi-

4 cal beauty,” she said. “They also had a women’s
rights movement there, except feminists aren’t
how you’d think of them here in America -
empowered women, total equality with men.
[Venezuelan women] want equality, but they
also want to extremely display their feminin-
ity.” ‘

It’s not just differences in culture that the
kitchen attempts to address, but political and
economic factors between nations as well. It
wasn’t that long ago that former President
George W. Bush and Chavez were sharing some
choice words with one another, but the animos-
ity stayed limited to words, not bombs.

“Our conﬂict in Venezuela is more based in
ideology and political inﬂuence,” Rubin said.
“The U.S. has a history and presence in many
Latin American countries by overtly and co-
vertly trying to create inﬂuence, supporting
coups, elections and regimes.”

Elected in 1999, Chavez enacted a series
of socialist reforms in Venezuela known as
the Bolivarian Revolution, and has spoken out
strongly against capitalism and imperialism.

But despite the rhetoric, relations between
the U.S. and Venezuela have remained fairly
civil in recent years. In 2005, Venezuela pro-
vided low—cost oil to poor neighborhoods in
New York andMassachusetts.

“It’s a much more nuanced animosity and
conﬂict,” Rubin said. “We are mass economic
partners with Venezuela; they import a mass
amount of oil to us. That’s the interesting para-
dox  it’s easier to take a stand against coun-
tries we don’t have an economic relationship at
stake with in order to take the stance we do.”

And the workers running Conﬂict Kitchen
are already considering the next countries
they’l1 explore. Rubin plansto continue with
Cuba in the winter and possibly North Korea
next spring. I

FOOTBALL

Panthers show
inconsistencies
against Rutgers

Roger Sepich
Staff Writer

After the Pitt football team’s of-
fense put up 44 points in a domi-
nating victory over South Florida,
Panther fans hoped Todd Gra-
ham’s high—octane offense would
continue to perform efficiently
and successfully throughout the
rest of the_season.

But in Saturday’s demoral-
izing 34-10 loss at Rutgers, the
offense never found its rhythm,
demonstrating that consistency
is still missing from Pitt’s plan
of attack. i ‘

‘This was an extremely disap-
pointing_ game for us,” Panthers
head coach Todd Graham said in
a press conferenceafter the game.
“Coming off our best game of the
season last week, we played our
worst game tonight.”

The Rutgers game was a disap-

pointment despite efforts from
_Pitt’s star player, running back
Ray Graham, who is now the
second—leading rusher in the na-
tion and has recorded at least 100
yards from scrimmage in all six
Pitt games this season. The ju-
nior’s skills are unable to lead an
up-and-down offensive line and
unpredictable quarterback play,
which has held the team back.
V The Panthers’ quarterbacks
have now been sacked a Big East-
worst 27 times this season, after
Rutgers sacked the quarterbacks
six times in Saturday’s game.

“I can tell you that whoever we
had at quarterback, the way we
protected him, he was not going
to be successful,” Coach Graham
said. -

Starting quarterback Tino Sun-
seri felt that it was his job to tough

it out even when the offensive line .

was leaky.

“As a quarterback, you’ve got
to be able to take the hits and be
able to wipe them off, keep push-

ing and keep trying to lead your V

team down the ﬁeld,” Sunseri said
after the Rutgers game.

Despite Sunseri’s' efforts, he .

was not able to 7‘fs_hake_ -‘off the

When Sunserihas been able

to get passes off this season,’ he’s

’ shown that he canhelp the of- 1

fense be successful. But his lack

of mobility has led Coach Graham A ~

to put freshman Trey -Anderson in
on multiple occasions.’ ’ V T
“We were __,struggling to do
anything, and we thought with
all the pressure_t_hat Trey could,
move a,little.;bi,t  get? out of

trouble,” Graham  “We, were ‘
doing something try to‘ spark V

our offense.” . 

The injuries to tiwoofvthe best I _
Pitt offensive linemen — seniors ' *

Chris Jacobson arid Lucas Nix
— certainly haven’t helped the
Panthers’ struggles to protect the
quarterback. Jacobson is out for
the season, but_Nix might return
in the next few weeks.

Knowing otherteams willlook A

to exploit Pitt’s problems protect-
ing its quarterback,.the Panthers
enter every game knowing that
avoiding sacks is key. But despite
Pitt’s preparation for the pressure

up front, the Scarlet Knights were ’

still succe,ssful, ﬁnding the Pan-
thers’ weaknesses and ruth_'lessly
attacking them. _    P
“We expected them to_;',bl_itz,”

Cuba breaks all—time
scoring record at Pitt

Jon Anzur
. Staff Writer

Ashley Cuba only needed one goal to tie the
all-time goals record at Pittforwomen’s soccer.
Instead, she scored three. _ ’ »
Cuba erupted for the hat-trick on Sunday,
pacing the Panthers (2-10-4, 1-5-2) to a 6-1
victory over St..John’s (8-6-1, 4-3) and their
ﬁrst win on Ambrose Urbanic Field, their new
home this season. .
Cuba ﬁnished senior Katie Ruhe’s tl1rough-
ballto put the Panthers in front 1-0 in the eight“
minute. Her second goal of the game —— and

an ESPN All-America selection in 2009. Cuba
was even nominated for the Gatorade Player of
the Year award in 2008 for women’s soccer.

Nevertheless, the relief of ﬁnally burying
the historic goal was as strong as the satis-
faction of claiming the school’s scoring title,
Cuba said. ‘ -

“I think having the pressure to get those last
two [goals] to break it was on my shoulders,
and it’s just a huge weight lifted dff now,” she
said. ,

Cuba credited the achievement to her high
standards and relentless urge to succeed, along
with the support from her teammates and
coaches. Her winning traits were evident from

  I think she's going to smash the
record, with having the rest of this
season and another season to do it.
-Sue-Moy Chin A

19“‘ of her storied career — came in the 29“
minute and placed Cuba ahead of Ashley Hab-
bel as Pitt’s all-time goals leader. Cuba added to
her newly achieved record in the 82"“ minute,
putting the Panthers up 4-0 and effectively
sealing the game in their favor.

“I’m really happy for her breaking the re-
cord today,” head coach Sue-Moy Chin said in
a press release. “I think she’_s going to smash
the record, with having the rest of this season
and another season to do it.”

Indeed, it was only a matter of time before
Cuba moved into the top spot in the record
book. Out of high-school, the starforwardwas

99  

the day she arrived in Oakland nearly three
years ago.

Cuba graduated from Cardinal Mooney V

High School in Youngstown, Ohio, months
before the rest of her class and enrolled at Pitt
in 2009, right in time for spring training.
During her freshman season, Cuba scored
seven goals — tying her for third most in a
single season in school history —- and became
the third women’s soccer player at Pitt ever
to earn Big East All-Rookie Team honors.

  Panthers try to make  

late-season rally

-Bobby Mizia Itaff Phographer

Ashley Cuba works the ball upﬁeld for Pitt. The junior forward scored three goals to
- break Pitt’s all-time scoring record on Sunday.

Women’s Soccer<‘16

She started the following season by tying the
team’s single-game goal record with a hat-trick
against Buffalo. ‘

But on Sunday, Cuba earned her most im-
pressive distinction yet.

‘~‘It’s an honor, it really is,” Cuba said. “Look-
ing back and being able to say that I got [the
goal-scoring record] is awesome.”

Ruhe, who played for Pitt when Habbel
broke the scoring record in 2009, said that al-
though both moments were “exciting,” the re-
cord-breaking performance on Sunday means
more for her and her struggling team. '

“I only got to play two years with Ashley
Habbel;  be my fourth year with Cuba,”
Ruhe said. “I  I deﬁnitely helped her out

a little bit more, just because I’ve had more '

time with her. As long as shelkeeps scoring,
I*ll be happy. Asa team, we need her to keep
scoring.”

Cuba said that, going forward, her focus
will be strictly on helping her team qualify for
the Big East tournament. _ .

“Making the tournament was always the
most important thing; the individual goals
were more of a bonus,” Cuba said. “I knew that
they’d come, slowly but surely.”

Sunday’s victory brings Pitt within six
points of the ﬁnal playoff spot, currently held
by UConn_ -- the Panthers’ next opponent.
After the match with the Huskies on Friday,
Pitt will travel to Providence before concluding

the regular season at home against ﬁrst-place
West Virginia. Cuba said that her team must
win out to have a shot, however remote, at
making the tournament. '

If Sunday’s throttling of St. John’s is any
indication, Pitt is moving in the right direc-
tion. ‘

The Panthers outshot the visiting Red
Storm 21-14 on Sunday. After Cuba’s record-
breaking goal, sophomore Dana DelleFemine
scored her ﬁrst goal of the season to put the
Panthers up 3-0 in the 53"’ minute. She added
her second goal in the 85“‘ minute — less than

' two minutes aﬁer freshman Madison Gritsch

scored hersecond goal of the season — to
make the score 6-0: the highest goal total Pitt
has" scored since 1998, and the highest-ever
under Chin. .

“That’s something we addressed _during
training this week,” Chin said on the team’s
website. “We talked about why goals weren’t
being scored, which was not enough shoot-
ing, inaccurate shooting, or the shots are too
late because they} are trying to get a perfect
shot.” , p '

The Panthers defense, which had been sur-
rendering an average of 2.6 goals per game
heading into Sunday’s match, held St. John’s
scoreless until Chelsey Martino’s goal with 30
seconds remaining. Pitt goalkeeper Kristina
Rioux made four saves on the day, increasing
her Big East-leading season total to 88. i

Seton Hall,

Men’s Soccer 4 15

'5-1 in the ﬁrst half. _ I

“They have very good individual players.
They can hurt you if you don’t really pressure
them and mark tight,” Luxbacher said. “In
the ﬁrst half, they were getting’ too much
space and they had us chasing the ball. Our
guys tightened up in the second halfﬁ’

Max Garcia, Seton Hall’s leading scorer,
had ‘three shots before intermission. But the
Panthers shut him and the rest of the Pirate
offense down in the second half when they
added an extra midﬁelder. i

“We made some adjustments at thehalf,

V particularly in the midﬁeld,” Luxbacher said.

“They’re very good in the midﬁeld. They
were having their way with us. We were basi-
cally trying to tighten it up_.”

The adjustments worked. Seton Hall-
couldn’t create much oifense late in the
game, and’Pitt earned its second confer-
ence win, already topping last season’s 1-6-2
record.

“It was a great second-half performance,”
goalkeeper Leejohnston said after the game.
“In the ﬁrst half, we weathered the storm.
They had a lot of chances in front of the goal,
but I think once we got out of that, we came
out strong and did what we needed to do,
and got the result.” _

' Johnston ﬁnished with two saves for his
second shutout of the season. The fresh-
man is now third in the Big East in both save
percentage(.853) and goals-against average 1
(0.68). ‘

Luxbacher said thatjohnston is the start-

er in the net going forward.
“Lee’s the guy,” he said. “He did every-
thing we asked tonight.” 1
Kuzan made three savesfor Seton Hall in

' his ﬁrst start this year. The Pirates have used

four different keepers in 12 games and have
struggled to-ﬁnd a reliable starter in net.

The game Saturday was also noteworthy
for the number of fouls called on both teams.
The Pirates and Panthers totaled 29 as they
played one of the more physical gamesthis
fall. 1 p

“I didn’t expect it to be that physical with
them,” Onyeukwu said. “But in the Big East,
everything is physical. You have to be able
to play through it.”

Pitt will have another tough contest when
it hosts rival West Virginia in the Backyard
Brawl Wednesday at 7 p.m. The Mountaineers
upset No. 13 Georgetown Saturday, 1-0.

The Panthers and Mountaineers are tied
in the Big East standings with identical 2-1
records. ﬂ '
