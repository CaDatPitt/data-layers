Graduation
Invitations
Sale Opens

Toda_v’s election of members to of-
ficers of the College Association marks
the beginning‘ of the 14th year of
the Association’s existence.

The College Association was start-
ed with the purpose of organizing stu-
dents enrolled in the College into
a coordinated group.

As its objectives it claims three
things. During each year the Associa-
tion sponsors ﬁve dances, two formal,
two informal, and a “Howdy Hop,”
which is a tea (lance and opens the
U.niversity social season. The Asso-
ciation conducts a student loan fund,
open to students for short-term loans
at no interest cllargc. The loan fund
is built up by proﬁts from the dances.

The third objective is to sponsor at
least one assembly, presenting‘ a
prominent “outside” speaker.

Dr. Omar C. Held, assistant dean
of the Collr-'_o;o, in f.-icnlty arlvinor.

Announcements For Stadium
Ceremonies Will Double
As Entrance Cards

Senior announcements this year
have been graduated from the status
of a mere hint to Aunt Susabella that
“Johnny is graduating from college
this year, so how’s about it, huh?”

For this year the announcements
do more than state that there will
be graduation ceremonies in the Sta-
dium, J unc 9. Every senior announce-
ment is also an invitation to the
graduation exercises.

Sell For 35 Cents

So Aunt Susabella, and Uncle
Snazzy, too, can come to the Stadium
and see Johnny get his diploma as
well as put the blue lcather bound
book away for a keepsake.

The leather bound booklets con-
taining the names of all tlioso receiv-
ing degrees from the U_nlve1's1ty 111
June and pictures of fainiliar campus
views are on sale this week for 35
cents each, or three for one dollar.
Invitations bound in glossy white
leather will sell for 25 cents each.

The booklets will remain on sale
until next Friday, and may be pur-
chased from any member of the
senior announcements committee. The
purchase is to be paid for when the
books are ordered. Date for distribu-
tion has been set as May 18.

Student Injured

Ruth Horowitz, C37, is a patient
in the Monteﬁore Hospital today
as a result of a skull fr-act.ure
suffered when a burglar entered
her home and struck her with a
blackjack. The intruder escaped
with Miss Horowitz’s wristwatch
and change from her purse.

Miss Horowitz is a lncmber of
the editorial board of the News
and is sec1'c‘ra1'y of Xylon, honor-
ary journalistic fraternity for
women.

It is probable that she will not
be able to return to school this
semester.

Fraternity Coalition
Holds Inside Track
In Balloting Today

Independent Win Hinges Upon Large
Turnout Of Voters, With Weather,
Minor Parties Still In Question

VOTING MACHINES TO BE USED

, By S. F. AYERS

Working itself up to a fast-moving climax as the polls open at 9 :15
o’clock in Memorial Hall this morning, the University election
campaign will hit top-speed by noon and continue at a high pitch
until the last button is pushed in the County-loaned voting ma-
chines at 5:30 o’clock.

Political lineups on the vari-colored slates which have been add-
ing to janitors’ troubles again show proof of the old adage: “Poli-
tics makes strange bcdfcllows.” For the first time in political
history all the fraternity men have banded together for the avowed
purpose of “licking the independents, once and for all," and if this
election can be predicted upon any mathematical basis whatsoever,
the Greeks have a very good chance of doing just that.

Fraternity Slates Have 175 Votes

Past performances say that about 1550 votes will be cast for SFA.
If this IS the case, approximately 167 votes will be necessary for
election. And the fraternities are running four slates with close to
175 votes behind each slate. On the surface, it appears to be a cinch.

Principals in the fraternity party are executive committcemcn
Bill Schenck, Phi Gam; Al Barr, Phi Kap; and Bud Teitelbaum,
Phi Ep; each has rigged up a particularly strong set of candidates,
each of whom appears certain of election.

But that's only one side of the picture. In the underdog position
is the "Independent” party, made up of parts of that vast nebular
group of non-fraternity students who make up more than 75 per
cent of the student body. This group, according to Independent
leaders, will rise up in anger against the whole idea of fraternity
domination, and will swamp the Greeks under an avalanche of
votes.

 

Independents Need Heavy Vote

According to Independent Bosses Bill McQuade, June graduate,
Ernie Rose, ex-Delt, and Bill Stark, all that their coalition needs
is a large total number of votes to win. They reason this way: “The
fraternities will have a hard time drawing any non-fraternity sup-
port. But they’ll be elected if they only need 175 votes to get in.
Therefore, it’s our job to get everybody on campus, or almost
everybody, down to the polls, raise the necessary minimum and
shove the fraternities right out of the picture.

But the Independents are worried, as they’ll admit, themselves.
Bad weather would do them at least as much harm as it would Bill
Benswanger’s Pirates across Forbes Street. And if the weather is
oso nice that the baseball game
draws a large number of Univer-
sity students, they’re sunk again.

However, weather reports are
extremely gratifying to the non-
fraternity men. It Wlll be “partly
cloudy, with a crisp wind and
occasional flurries of rain,” an
exact counterpart of the weather
conditions under which the Inde-
pendent-Beta coalition snatched
a majority last year.

In addition to these two par-
ties, there are at least two other
groups running individual candi-
dates for SFA and College As-

sociation. Most to be reckoned
with is the “Progressive-Inde-
pendent” party, a group which
had only one of nine candidates
nominated, but which is reported
to have gathered enough support
to put that one man in. just how
he will stand in regard to execu-
tive committee elections is a
matter of which both parties are
entirely ignorant.

Also in the running is the
“Non-Fraternity Fraternity In-
dependent Independent” party, a
group unsupported by any of thc

Gets Century Club

At its meeting last Tuesday, the
Senior B-all committee selected the
spacious ballroom‘ of the Twentieth
Century Club as the site of the alfair
in preference to the more cramped
quarters of the Urban Room and
Webster Hall which were also under
co_nsideration.

The 4000 square feet of the Club
compares favorably with the 3500
and 3000 feet of the other two.

Arrangements are being made for
practically the whole Club in addition
to the Ballroom to be turned over to
the dancers. Two lounges, two foyers,
and the entrance hall lined with
couches and chair.; will be reserved
for those choosing to sit out a dance.

At the present time the orchestra
has not been announced, but it is pre-
dicted that a prozninent local orches-
tra will probably get the contract.

HOWN above are four nominees

for positions in the College Ae-
aociation Cabinet. ‘

Top left, John Michelosen, '38,
president; top right, Verna Doug-
las, '38, president. Bottom left,
Muriel Lowy, '40, treasurer; bot-
tom right, Ray Light, '40, vice-
president.

Candidates not pictured above
are: Theodore Whitaker, '38, presi-
dent; Jane Mehler, '38, and Ruth
McHenry, '40, secretary; Charles
Smullin, ’38; Harry Bash, '39; and
Gertrude Hamburg, ’40, treasurer.

From 9 Until Dusk

Who? Freshman Sports Unit
' What? Play Day" —- - "

When and where? Trees Gym to-
morrow.

Members of the freshman sports
unit have invited all the first year
women to Play Day which it is. SP011‘
soring tomorrow ‘at Trees Gym. Betty
Fagan, C, chairman of the unit group
and chairman of the affair, promlses
“one whole day of playing where all
the freshman women can become
acquainted and have a marvelous
time.” '

Although the sports unit has been
busy all year planning many activi-
ties, this affair is its biggest one.
Entertainment has been prepared for
the entire morning and afternoon.
The schedule includes:

Registration—9 until 10 o’clock.

Actual play—-10 until 12:30 o’clock.

Luncheon—12 :30 ‘o’clock.

Swimming—during the afternoon.

One of the feature attractions of

- the affair is a group of games which

are to take placeoutside. If old man
weather does not permit, then the
activity will ‘continue in the building.

Since all the f_reshman women have
been invited to attend Play Day, the
committees have taken into consid-
eration all types of activity. For
those women who have a low health
rating, quiet games will be provided.
In fact all kinds of games from jack-
straws to mushball are on the pro-
gram of the day's entertainment.

During registration the guests will
be divided into groups. Then when
the play period begins each of these
groups will rotate‘ and participate in,
the games arranged for them.

Four committees‘ assisted Miss
Fagan in planning Play Day. The
social‘ committee, headed by Betty
Keefer, C, consists.of Betty Cerra,
C; Grace Richards, C; and Rose
Marie Kavanaugh, C. In charge of
the program committee is Eileen
Boyle, C. Dorothy Elliott, C, is the
leader of the group committee."Betty
Fagan, C, is helping with the singing
arrangements. ' -

ten cent tickets scattered in the lot.

;Other tickets are priced from thirty

each ticket is concealed under a gold
seal whichis "broken only after each
purchaser selects her ticket.

Ann Whippo, social chairman of
the class, promises plenty of refresh-
ments and informal games. Dress for

spite of the exclusive nature of Miss
Whippo’s plans. , .

Urged y Freelio7lAt Peace Meeting

4

The most promising ‘path to peace”
is adoption of a “no foreign war” pol-
icy, Dr. Solomon B. Freehof, noted
Jewish clergyman and author, ad-
vised students at a University-wide
peace assembly yesterday in Memorial
Hall.

Dr. Freehof spoke before a sparse
at the meeting sponsored

Pea.ce Committee of SFA, on .the sub-
ject “Is There a. Path t.o Peace?”
Preceding his address was a talk by
‘William Stark, ‘C38. ‘

“An attainablc,- realistic, point of
view,” the speaker called a pledge to
ﬁglrt for on_e's country only for inter-
nal defense. He quoted ﬁgures to
show that college students are over-
whelniingly -in favor of such an atti-
t.ude,_-a11d..':'Idded that7 “it is a‘-po-int of
view. to_..wlIicl1 the restof ‘the World
can be won.'’’, . ..

But along with this policy of “no
American soldier on a foreign battle-
ﬁeld,” Dr. «Freehof stressed the ne-

'cessi_t_v_ for “not _a dollar to any for-

said, ‘_‘go -to ﬁght on ‘foreign ﬁelds be‘-
causei tour dollars have preceded
them.”

After emphasizing that-the popular
conception that “nobody xvants-‘“‘vvar”
is not true, he analyzed two current

Foraniinifera Play S t a r, R ole
In Cathedral’s C 0 ns t ru cit i o 11

By Robert Brown
Almost everyone at the University

knows what a dinosaur is, but it is a
pretty safe bet that few could satis-

l.'actorily explain the part that*fora-

niinifera had in the construction of

the Cathedral.

Yet, according to Henry Leighton’,
professor and head of the department.
of geology, these tiny_i.shells_» of the
Mississippian period constitute a large
part of thernakeup ofthe‘ Indiana

‘limestone that is being,-..usedVfo,1~ the
interior of the Commons Room.

Two hundred ‘and ﬁfty million years‘
ago these creatures, rangingpin size
from pinpoints to an‘ihch'or more in
length, swam through life in the warm

inland sea thatg:'o'ccupied the region

from southern Pennsylvania to the

they sank to the bottom of the ocean,

-and in the comparatively sliort geo-
logical period -of two or three hun-

dred million years, managed to-build
up a strata oi"? pure reek about sixty

miles in depth.

Strange World
It was a strange world in which

these foraminifera lived. It was not

a very exciting world. There was no
evidence of any kind of life withithe

smallest sort of a ‘vertebrae; every-
thing moved in a slow vegetative’; cy- L

cle. Some of the tougher varieties of

seaweed had managed to eke out a

partial existence',.on‘ land, but they
were periodically .washed by the tide.
There is no evidence, to believe that
the earth was warmer then than now,
a.nd the only sound in the strange

Qpening Day,
E ‘DON’T SEE AS IT makes much differ-
ence who wins in today’s elect-ions. It is
established that there are just TWO PARTIES
in the race, with_ a flock of independent-iiide-
penden-ts on the outside hoping and liopiiigfoi’
the improbable. But they arcn’t _real. ‘parties.
Rather, they are two groups,» with»_individuals
in each "working together just for this one elec-
tion;” and then win or lose, each will separate to
initiate various kinds of individual legislation
that will save the student body from all the evils
of an immoral self-government. _ ‘
’I‘o repeat, we don’t see as it makes much dill_er-
once, for most of the boys are taking this thing
as a publicity lark and are going to have just as
much fun as they can. After they are elected, if
they are elected, most of them will be just so
many nonenties in a calm of holiness, from the
high potentate down to the lowest stand_ing com-
mittee member. The president and a few of his
associates by virtue of their positions will likely
make ODK and a few other honoraries, and "then,
their tasks will be done. Few of them have any
speciﬁc idea of just what they will do or try to
do if they should win out at the polls. But that
doesn’t trouble them.

0 digress, one of the more prominent political

bosses told us the other day that working on
The News breeds cynicism. Possibly, possibly
not. A few of us hope it may at least be a cyni-
cism, purged with mild doses of enlightenment,
a both deadly and horrible disease, we agree.
Possibly not. However, we still maintain that it
doesn’t make“ much difference. At the present
time, it looks like a fraternity landslide. Oh, the
independents, so-called, will easily vote in a few
outstanding men. And the Dents will be good for
their end of the Independent slate. But even
combined, they hardly stand to make it more than
ten, even though they have the stronger candi-
dates. The Greeks with even a greater number of
nonenities and play-boys than usual are almost
“Bound to Win.”

Although the fraternity man is always the bet-
ter vote-getter, the John Brackens excepted, he
generally proves himself to be a pretty bad legis-
lator. We must admit that he promotes and leads
ﬁne dances, much better than any other person;
but his SFA job usually stops there. So, if your
vote is extra and lonely, you might toss _it to
MacQuade’s men, or any of the real independents,
though we warn you, it won’t do much good.

THERE'S NOT MUCH that aestudent govern-

ment can do, aside from the regular routine
of pep ‘assemblies, freshman customs, committee
and assembly meetings, and standing committees
to investigate plausibility or to make reports.
Perhaps that is the extent of any student govern-
ment, and as such the issue should be closed.
However, there are those who might suggest that
a student legislature “might” look into this thing
called student welfare, which they talk so much
about. For instance, a boy comes into The News
office asking The News to help him find the hit-
and-run driver who smashed his parked car Tues-
day past. “Gruesome, ain’t it” is the obvious
answer. Yet we run a notice requesting any per-
son who saw the event to report and tell us all
about it. However, the News hardly has the time
or energy to see the thing through after that
stage, unless additional publicity of the facts is
needed. '

We might suggest student consultation with
Library officials to clear up a few rules which
have caused students embarrassment and concern.
Perhaps the rules need to be interpreted or ex-
plained. We might suggest that SFA clear its
decks of dance appointment debris. If the class
chairmen were elected by the student body at a
general election at one time, inane internal
bickering would be wiped out, and outside group
pressure on relatively unimportant business
would be replaced by pressure for more worth-
while and vital issues. SFA playboys would rc-
sign their seats.

We might suggest that SFA cooperate on
these and many more things, with its official or-
gan, The News. SFA’s voice should be heard
sharp and strong through the student newspaper.
The News should be a means to accomplishing
the many ends of SFA legislation. But the pres-
ent SFA issues of relative importance are few.
and there are so many issues that are either over-
played, or else just not worth much at all, that
the quality is strained and so is the relationship.

Gee, I betcha those Pirates play a swell game
today.

Late. To The Editor

    

= Editor. The Pitt News:

Following its declared policy of presenting

- openly to the students all matters dealing with
its aims and organization, the Independent Party"

takes this opportunity to answer certain false
charges made by representatives of the fraternity»
coalition.

THE CHARGE: That the Independent Party
is not truly independent because it is supported
by Dental fraternities and some of the women’s
fraternities. , H _

THE ANSWER: . . A

1. The Dental Sch‘ool‘.'is .1 whole, both inde-
pendents and professional fraternity. men. are
supporting the Intlepcndcnts because they be-
lieve in the policies and aims of the party.

,2. The Independent Party is not anti-fraten
nity: it is attempting to prevent control of the
campus by the 15 per cent of students who be-'
long to the 13 men's social fraternities. ~

3. Every Independent Party candidate _is posi-_

tively pledged Independent. . _.
THE CHARGE: That one of the Iiidep_endent
Party candidates is a member of a men's social-
fraternity, thus indicating that the party is not
truly Independentp » : _ ' - .
THE ANSWER: ‘‘ __ ~ ,
1. This candidate hasliceii iiiactivc inliis‘fr'.‘i-_
ternity for two, aiida half years. Ile was elected
to SFA by the-;vote of his school, not tlirougli
thebacking of social frateriiities. He" has been
selected by his school as their official represen-
tative, and, since ‘his school's common interest is
not with social fraternities, he hassubscribcd

completely to the party in accordance with the

wishes of his school and his own personal ideals.

This letter will clear up any false impressions
created by the party’s opposition as ‘an unfair
weapon to detract from itssupport by "the" inde-
pendent voters on campus. , . V

departments and schools in the University. A complete
tabulation of all these publications is kept, however, in
