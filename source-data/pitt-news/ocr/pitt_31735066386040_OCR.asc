Officials call black drop-out rate unacceptable

By Jennifer Calabrese
Senior Staﬂ’ Writer

Sixty-four percent of African American
students at Pitt leave without graduating,
according to a report recently released by
the Senate Student Affairs Committee.

“Minority retention at Pitt is simply
unacceptable,” Professor Jonathan
Schooler, chairman of the Senate Student

Affairs Committee, told a meeting of the
Faculty Assembly yesterday.
Low grades, experiences with racial

A prejudice and family problems are among
the reasons Schooler cited. These came as

a result of meetings SAC held with Associate
Provost Jack Daniels, College of Arts and
Sciences Dean Mary Briscoe, former Black
Action Society Chairwoman Terri .Tinnin
and other campus leaders to explore the

reasons for the high attrition. The group
also said that reduced financial aid and
unhappiness with social and academic
environment were to blame.

The black dropout rate is compared

with a 32—percent attrition rate among’

white students at Pitt. Schooler said that
Pitt’s black attrition rate is comparable to
the national average. ,

“It is close to the average, but it is not as

good as it could be. Pitt does not settle for
mediocrity in other areas, so it should not
settle for it here,” Schooler said.

Pitt is currently running several programs
that are aimed at improving minority
retention. Among them is UCEP, which
identiﬁes at-risk students and provides
them with support services.

“Most students in this program are African

respond
to Mills’
decision

The all-female student bodies
of Chatham and Mills Colleges _
have something in common.

The Mills College adrninistr—
ation announced earlier this year
that the school would begin
admitting .nen due to financial
problems.

Mills students, wearing “Better
Dead than Co-ed” T—shirts,
protested on campus and in the
media. .

Earlier this year, Chatham 2
College also found itself faced
with the possibility of going co-
ed.

“It [wasn't] totally a monetary
issue, because we feel that the A
college needs to be larger 
academically, socially and
financially,” said Chatham
President Rebecca Stafford.

Stafford said that Chatham is
not currently considering
admitting men.

“What Chatham is doing is
working very hard to envision a
revitalized Chatham, and gender
is not even an issue,” she said.

Stafford was surprised by Mills
students’ reaction to the
administration's initial decision
to admit men.

According to Stafford, the
committee that looked into the
ﬁnancial problems at Mills
included students, faculty and
administration.

“I was totally bafﬂed that they
hadn’t talked about this [admitting
men] before,” Stafford said.

“I understood that they had
spent two years [researching a
solutionl,” she said. \

Stafford cited some -4 of the
benefits of a women’s college vs.
a co—ed education.

there is a stigma associated with
participating in the program,”
_Schooler said.

Freshman-studies courses have
also taken steps to improve the
cultural environment on campus,
including considerations for
special sections of freshman
studies with equal proportions of
African American and white
students.

“These programs are working,
but a lot more can be done to
help,” Schooler said.

The committee outlined

additional suggestions for
improving the situation, among
them having a minority adviser in
each dorm, increased ﬁnancial
scholarships for minorities and
increased student-faculty
interactions. .
Several faculty members at the
meeting expressed concerns
about how these plans would be
implemented. ,
“The problem is that we study

Editor’: note- The names of the
patients quoted in this story have

been cbanged to protect their .

conﬁdentiality.

Madonna. ‘Beethoven. Spiro
Gyra. Bobby Brown. Aerosmith.

Each of these artists evokes
distinctly different sensations from
the listener. According to one
researcher, music can enhance
happy, sad, romantic or scared
feelings.

“Music is a force in our lives, a
presence,” said Elaine Camerota,
Ed. D., coordinator of the Creative
and Expressive Arts Therapy
Program at Western Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic. ,

Music is often applied as part
of a patient’s therapy regime at
WPIC. “Music can be used to
correct, lift [and] stabilize  one’s
mood [even if temporarilyl," said
Camerota. ’ «

“I feel good in here [a music-
therapy session]; I like music,“
said Bonnie, a patient at the
hospital. , V

Music therapy is prescribed to
inﬂuence changes in maladaptive
behavior patterns, according to
Lynn Bruner, registered music
therapist on the Mood Disorders
Unit.

One of Bruner’s most
memorable cases involved a 19-

year-old freshman college
student, Samantha, who had a
“teeny-weeny speaking voice."
She was in the hospital for an
attempted suicide.

Samantha refused to
acknowledge feelings and. was
especially fearful of expressing
them in a group situation, Bruner
recalled.

The first step in her treatment
was to get Samantha to identify
feelings with the use of musical
instruments. '

Music

therapists use

instruments especially made for
music education and therapy. '

Melody instruments like the
glockenspiel, a xylophone—type
instrument with a wooden base
and steel bars that produces a
high-pitched tone; the
metallophone, . which gives a
softer, ringing sound; and many
rhythm instruments such as hand
drums, maracas, piano, guitar and
the omnichord (an electronic
version of the autoharp) are
typical of those used in music
therapy. \ T

Samantha first listened to the‘
different sounds the instruments
made during one of her early
group sessions. Eventually Bruner
asked, “What does anangry sound
sound like?” Samantha was then
able to choose a sound and an
instrument with which she felt
Comfortable.

she asked Samantha to express
an angry feeling in a group
session.

“She immediately chose a drum,
but she couldn't hit it —— she was
shaking so much. I gave her a
chance to do it on her own [she
couldn’t], then I helped her strike
it once. That was all she could
handle," said Bruner.

“The next time she was able to
hit it on her own; she even scared
the group members  it [was] so
loud,” said Bruner.

Like Samantha, all patients who
participate in music-therapy
sessions do so as part of their
treatment process. Music

therapists work closely with the .

attending physicians, social
workers and others assigned to
care for the patients.

Many times patients will tell a
music therapist that they haven't

‘even told their doctor about the
therapy, according to Connie
Henderson, a registered music
therapist on the Schizophrenia
Unit. ’

Henderson believes this stems
from the fact that while physicians
and other caretakers focus on
what is wrong, music therapy
looks at a patient’s strengths and
offers hope to them. “Music 
deals with the strengths of a
person while in the hospital,”
said Henderson.

She added that an elderly
patient once told her, “Music helps

 
   

 

you_say the things that you want
to say." '

Because the sessions are
located in the kitchen areas of the
respective units, music therapists
can be seen lugging their
instruments, bags of song books
and stereo systems to and from
the locked inpatient units.

Cathy Laus, a music therapist
on the two geriatric units at WPIC,
was a professional entertainer for
about 15 years, traveling all over
the United States for seven of

those years before becoming and

music therapist in 1986. Not able
to make a comfortable living as
an entertainer, Laus heard about
music therapy through
acquaintances and decided to talk
to a music therapist and observe
one in action.

“lThere was] no doubt in my
mind — I wanted to be a music
therapist,” Laus said of the
encounter. She still sings
professionally when the demands
of graduate school and full-time
employment allow it.

Just as intense as Laus in ‘her
conviction to choose music
therapy as a career, Bruner knew
she wanted to work in the music
field since high school. Her first
contact with music therapy came
through her music education/
chorus teacher who brought old
journals to school for her to read.

These articles and an interest in
psychology propelled Bruner into

~ Music therapy aids treatment at Western Psych

the music-therapy field. She
attended Oberlin College in Ohio,

where she first discovered if

psychiatric music therapy. She
described it as a “perfect way to
use music” by blending the two.

She recently purchased a piano
to keep her music training up-to-
date. Besides her work at WPIC,
Bruner also plays and sings for
her church choir.

A typical start to a therapy
session has the music therapist
singing a welcoming song to the

group. Members of the group

then either select songs from their
books and sing or play an
instrument. After each piece,
patients. are asked to comment

on how the music makes them i

feel or why they selected a certain

song. ‘ .
During Henderson’s group, the

three patients seated around the

table were asked to adhere to all-— 0

unit rules. Peter, a short, middle-
aged ‘schizophrenic, said, “No
touching, no talking, no
smoking,” then spontaneously
added, “no hunting, no fishing.”
That dissolved any tension those
in the room felt. -
Henderson then began singing
a welcoming song to each patient.

‘Afterward, each patient had a

chance to strike a tune on the
glockenspiel. The others said how

they thought the patient felt based 0

on the tune they selected. .

Music

Continued from page 3

After Bonnie, a middle—aged
woman with unkempt white hair
that stood up on her head as if
she were attached to an electrical
socket, played her tune, she said,
“I feel good in here; I like music.”
Peter, sitting two chairs away,
added, “This group is cheering
her up.”

Peter was next. He proudly
struck the glockenspiel. When
no one could guess the tune, he
confidently played it again. In
the end, he had to tell the group
that it was the theme form
“M‘A‘S‘H.”

“[1] came into the group feeling
like I was in jail for a while. With
music I feel like I could escape
over the bars —— spiritually,” Peter
said.

Henderson ended the session
by asking the patients to select
and sing, as a group, their favorite
song from the song books.

Henderson’s. Each elderly patient

stress and
alcohol
consumption

‘ The psychological‘ stress and
socioeconomic status of low-
income black women can be
directly linked to alcohol
consumption, a study done by
the University of Pittsburgh
shows.

Researchers from the School of
Nursing surveyed 599 women
throughout the Pittsburgh area
between the ages of 25 and 75
years. Most of the women were
single mothers, had a high school
diploma and had a yearly income
of less than $7000.

“We found that the higher the
level of stress and the more

difficult the economic situation .

the women found themselves in,
the more beer and hard liquor
they consumed,” said Beryl
Jackson, Ph.D., associate
professor, School of Nursing.

"Because of the low income of
these women, we can speculate
that many of them might have
been engaged in ‘escape drinking’
as a means of coping with
psychological stress and chronic
life strains associated with their
economically disadvantaged
positions,” she said.

The study revealed a correlation
between religious values and
alcohol use. Results showed that
the stronger the religious
orientation of an individual, the
less hard alcohol was consumed.

_ According to Jackson, the
research supports the findings of
previous studies that suggested
women who abuse alcohol often
have encountered brief crises that

resulted in high levels of 7.

The patients all said their names
and something about themselves.
The highlight of the session was
that it was one patient’s last day
in the hospital. Her excitement
was contagious.

Laus thenhad the patients pair
up and select a song that the
group could sing together. One
pair selected “When Irish Eyes
are Smiling,” which led to a
discussion regarding ethnicity.
The group decided to insert their
respective nationality in place of
“Irish” in the song. Proudly and
loudly the smiling patients belted
out this tune.

Toward the end of the session,
Laus selected “Try to Remember”
and asked each patient to listen
closely to the words as she sang
and played the guitar for them.
They discussed parts of the song,
which brought back memories of
other times in their lives.

A folder containing
information about

Officers’ Training Corps was
found to be missing from a
locked desk in the Bisexual,
Gay and Lesbian Alliance
cubicle in the William Pitt
Union. A
BiGALA Co-president Mark
Smith said that the folder
contained news clippings and
other pieces of information
concerning ROTC discrim-

discrimination in the Reserve

missing from Zoc/eed Bz'GAl;A des/e  

ination, both nationally and
locally.

“The file concerns the Reserve
Ofﬁcers’ Training Corps. The Pitt
News has done some
investigative work lately
concerning ROTC discrimination.
The file has political significance
as well," Smith said.

“Concerning the political
nature of the file,” he added, “I
find it interesting that this file is
the only thing missing.”

Smith, who writes for The Pitt
News in addition to his
involvement in BiGALA, said that
he first noticed the file was

missing on __May 18. According to
Smith, no one except him had
access to the desk.

“I went to put a news clipping
in the file, and I noticed it was
missing. l’ve asked everyone in
the group who might’ve had
access to the file. No one removed
it," Smith said.

Smith said that he checked the
key sign-out sheets in the union
office to see if anyone else had
signed out the key to. the BiGALA
desk. There was no record of
anyone signing the key out except
himself for the month of May.

Smith said, “Other than Mark

Smith, no one should have had
access to the desk."

Officer Matt Kranjec of Pitt's
department of public safety
examined the desk and said
that there was no sign of forced
entry. Kraniec said that the file
would probably fall under the
“lost property” category.

“I think the chances of getting’
it back are slim to none.”
Kranjec said.

“I’m not accusing anyone of

Crane life support case
should be decided by courts

_ Since December of 1987, when he was just 7 weeks old,

‘ Leslie Michael Crane has been on a life-support system at

Children’s Hospital. He is comatose due to massive brain
injuries inflicted by his mother, Tracey Jean Crane, who is
serving six to 20, years in Muncy State Prison for abusing her
son. ,
Doctors at Children’s Hospital say further treatment is futile,
and they are trying to convincehis father, David Crane, to
consent to terminating life support. They have expressed
concerns that in caring for Leslie they are denying bed space
and care to a treatable patient. _
’ David Crane has refused, claiming that if his son dies, his wife
Tracey will be charged with homicide.
Tracey Crane was convicted of battering her son during his

first seven weeks of life, breaking his leg and fracturing his
‘ skull prior to this incident of abuse. She was put on probation

in 1984 after pleading no contest to charges that she threw her

infant daughter from a previous marriage across a room.

Children’s Hospital officials say they will petition the courts
later this month to appoint a new guardian for Leslie. They
believe that Crane is acting in the interests of his wife, rather
than his child. ‘

That Crane is not acting in the best interests of his son is
obvious. Leslie’s bones are fragile. His tendons are contracting,
causing his limbs to bow. There are patches over his eyes to
keep them from drying out. His face is contorted. He displays
only slight brain-stem activity and minimal reaction to outside
stimuli. The brain injuries inﬂicted by his mother are irrevers-
ible. t

The termination of life support is a decision reserved for the
families of untreatable patients. But cases in which the patient’s

. family is incapable of making a decision must be decided by

the courts. ‘

Leslie's parents are incompetent. Tracey Crane displayed her
irresponsibility by repeatedly abusing her infant children. And
David Crane, who has chosen to prolong his son's deteriora-
tion in order to protect his wife from criminal prosecution, is
clearly ill-equipped to make fair and rational decisions con-
cerning Leslie's welfare.

Leslie should have been removed from his parents’ custody
before this incident occurred. The decision of whether to
terminate life support for Leslie should now be made by a
responsible and competent court—appointed guardian who is
capable of determining what is best for the child.

The length of Tracey Crane's prison term should not factor
into the decision. The amount of time Tracey Crane spends
behind bars is irrelevant to the quality of Leslie's life and the
lives of those children for whom treatment is not futile.

Though Warren County District Attorney Joseph Massa Jr.
declined to say whether he will file homicide charges against

‘E Tracey Crane when her sondies, there is no question as to

‘whether he should.
Regardless of whether Leslie is on or _off life support when

. he dies, his death will have been caused by the injuries inflicted

by hismother. Tracey Crane should be prosecuted for this
crime.

Trashcan is no place for state

Any way you look at it, the amount of space left
in our nation’s landﬁlls is quickly dwindling. Ac-
cording to the February 1990 issue of The Free
Market, most currently existing landfills will be
filled to capacity within 10 years.

Some people thinkthat the government should
do something about this problem. Many local and
state governments, including Pennsylvania’s, have
already passed mandatory recycling laws. Some
people have suggested that certain items, such as
plastic diapers, should be banned.

That’s too bad, because in reality, it is govern-
ment involvement in garbage disposal that is the
cause of the landﬁll-space short-
age. What we really need is for

the price of having garbage put into it would

become higher and higher. This would encourage ~

people to use other, less expensive methods of
garbage disposal. Recycling is certainly one of
these methods. In such a situation people would
recycle their garbage, not because it was mandated
by law but because it was cheaper.

Separating one’s trash can be quite a tedious
chore. I certainly don’t want to have 27 different"
garbage cans in my kitchen. Again, the market
would respond by having recycling businesses that
would separate my trash for me. _

With -the free market being the driving force
behind it, there would be all
sorts of new, less expensive

the government to get out of the
garbage-disposal industry.
With our current situation,
garbage collection is carried out
by our local government. It is
funded by the money that we
pay in taxes. What any specific
individual (or family or house-
hold or whatever) pays for his
or her garbage to be taken away

with what it actually costs to get
rid of the garbage. Thus, there is
no incentive for people to limit
their garbage production.

But let’s say that the govern-
ment got out of the garbage
business, and privateenterprises

technologies developed to get
rid of garbage. Chemicals could
be developed to rearrange the
chemical structures of various
items of garbage into things that
were easier to dispose of. Bacte-
ria could, be genetically engi-
neered to eat garbage. The tech-
nologies of waste—to-energy that
are currently being worked on
could be sped up by increased
consumer demand. Nobody can
predict for sure what kinds of
technologies would become
popular in the future, but the
decision would be made by
consumers. a

took over. In such a situation,
the amount of money that a
particular person paid for his garbage to be taken
away would correspond to the amount of garbage
that that person produced. Just like every other
good or service that we get from the private sector,
the more of it that a particular person used, the
more that that person would pay. This would
encourage people to limit the amount of garbage
that they created. Consumers would look for
products that had the least amount of packaging,
and manufacturers would respond by using less
packaging on their products.

As landfill space becomes more and more scarce,

come into existence.

In recent years, we have witnessed many amaz-
ing advancements in computers, recorded music,
car telephones, photocopiers, fax machines and
many other areas of technology. These advance-
ments all came about through a free market
responding to consumers’ demands. If we had a

free market in garbage disposal, the same kind of

thing would happen in that area.

Why won 't the CAS Dean talk to the students?

’ Hello? Hello? Are you there CAS Dean Mary Brisoce?
My name is Jim Tezak. I’m the news editor for The Pitt News. Well, one of
them anyway. You wouldn’t know me, Mary, since you refuse to speak to

anyone from this newspaper.

I have, however, been wanting to ask you a question for a long time, Mary.
After many telephone calls, cancelled appointments and even trips to your

office, I’ve decided that the only way
I can communicate with you is through
this paper. I hope you’re not too busy
to read thislittle message from me and
my friends, Run DMC.

Mary, Mary, why you buggin’?

So just be quiet and don ’tsay nuthin ’.

Keeping quiet should be easy for

to say to The Pitt News anyway. ~

My question is  why?

I wish we could have had this

discussion in the privacy of your of— . .

fice, Mary, but before you get upset,
remember that it’s you who continu-
ally blows off me and the rest of the
staff. here. This seems to be my only

Supposed to be with me but now
you ’re frettin’
We started out new. You used to be
true.
_Now you’re buggin’, what’s wrong
with you? .
Has The Pitt News committed some

DEAN MARY BRISCOE

terrible wrong against you, Mary —— perhaps the ever—popular complaint,
“Misquotel”? Well, if it has, Mary, it must have been a long time ago because
I can’t recall your being quoted in a story in this paper for a long time.

In fact, Mary, any problems you have with The Pitt News are probably the
result of people who are no longer working here; it’s been that long since you
talked to any of us. Give us a chance, Mary. I think we have the best staff of
writers working here since I've been at Pitt. i

I’m not asking for your respect. I'm only asking you to give me and my writers
a chance to earn your respect. I'm not asking you to be at the beck and call
of The Pitt News. I'm just saying that the other administrators at this university

, can take time out of their busy schedules to speak to us. Why is it so difficult «

for you?

. When the news came that
Barbara Bush would be the
commencement speaker at Welle-
sley College, almost a quarter of

’ the graduating class was up in
arms. They wanted a self-made
woman, someone known forher
own accomplishments, to be their
graduation-day speaker. And at
the all-female school where

women are taught that they can I

find their own paths to success,

Mrs. Bush did not fit the bill.
The 1 50 Wellesley women who
signed a petition challenging the
selection have been criticized
i" many times over since their pro-
test began. Boston Globe colum-
nist Mike Barnicle even] went so
far as to call them “a pack of

whining, unshaven feminists.”
Name-calling aside, consider

this: Mrs. Bush was also ‘chosen a

as the commencementspeaker
at the very coed University‘ of
Pennsylvania. And while the an-
nouncement did cause concern
from some women’s groups on
campus, the opposition was
nothing compared to the out-
rage at Wellesley, according to
Penn's student newspaper. And
with a graduating class of over
2,200, compared with Wellesley’s
600, the Penn “protest” is even
more diminished.

So why such :a different reac-
tion at two private schools, both
known for excellence, both with

a rich history filled with student

administrators will. start to say, “Hey, if Mary doesn’t have to talk to those
annoying kids, why should I?” As we pay all of your salaries, Mary, you have

WANT ED

a duty and responsibility to respond
to any and all questions that are
asked by students. Students who work
for The Pitt News included. Remem-
ber, Mary, when you don’t speak to
us, you’re refusing to speak to the

. student body, as we are its published

forum.

If you don’t believe me that we
have a good staff here, Mary, talk to
some of your own peers. Just a few
weeks ago, I spoke to Jack Freeman.
At the end of the interview,.I thanked

him very much for his time. “No if

problem,” he said; “I can always find.

time to’ fit one more thing into my I

schedule during theiday.” Hmmm,
that's not the impression I get from
you, Mary.

Ask the big guy, Wesley Posvar

himself, if you don’t believe me. ,

There is a reporter on staff who has
been in close contact with Posvar
throughout-the year. She’s earned his
respect. It’s no problem for us to get
an interview with Wes now. In fact,

when he announced his retirement .

and we wanted to talk to him about
it, it took one phone call. And guess
what, Mary? We didn’t even have to
go to his office to talk to him. He
came here to ours. I

. If we can win the respect of the
president of ' this university, Mary,
don’t you think that you can at least
give us a chance? To be fair, you
aren't the _only administrator_ who

. avoids The Pitt News. You do, how-

ever, win the award for being the

K

Most Inaccessible Administrator. .

Maybe you should come up to our offices some production night and see
how much work it takes to put out an issue of The Pitt News, Mary. I bust my
butt, and so does everyone else up here. I'm sick and tired of having to run
stories that are good, but would be a hell of a lot more informative to our
readers with just one or two comments from you. ‘ * 

From now on, Mary, this won't happen. We will talk to. you one way or
another. We'll be waiting outside your office when you leave to go home or.
to lunch. We'll. bewaiting by your car. Whatever we have to do, we’ll'do. it, ~
because that's the type of people we have working here now. ' 4

protests? The newspaper at Penn
cited other campus concerns at
the time of the announcement as
part of the reason for the apathy
there, but the real reason might
lie in the one all-important dif-
ference between the two schools.
At the all-female Wellesley, the
controversy took front stage; at
coed Penn it was pushed aside.
The women at Wellesley chose
to attend a school where the
importance of independence and
personal achievement is stressed.

‘ They learned in an environment

that strengthened them and
prepared them for the rigors of a
world that historically has fa-
vored men. At Wellesley, they
have been guaranteed a chance

to excel without the threat of sex
discrimination. While critics have
called all-female schools separa-
tist and have thrown out accusa-
tions of reverse discrimination,

Calabrese

the fact remains that in a world
where women make approxi-
mately 65 cents for every dollar
a man makes, the special envi-
ronment of all-female schools is
an option that women deserve to

have.

The option to attend a women’s A

college has recently been threat-

ened at Mills College in Califor-

nia, one of only a handful. of

women’s colleges left in the’

United States. When the an-
nouncement was made in April
that Mills would go coed be-
cause of financial troubles, stu-

dents there closed down the ‘

school by physically blocking

the entrances to buildings on '

campus. »

Just another example of the
pro-active attitude that a women’s
college can foster.

Big East Conference needs to find life after Gavitt

If you were a New England
Irishman and had the game of
basketball in your blood since
you could crawl, what would be
your dream occupation? Maybe
chief operating officer of the
Boston Celtics? Former Big East
Commissioner Dave Gavitt fits
that mold exactly and recently
left his post for the above-
mentioned position with one of
professional ‘sports’ proudest
traditions. .

The Big East has emerged as
one of the nation’s premier
basketball ‘conferences due to
Gavitt’s knowledge of the game
and his extraordinary vision. He
and "his .staff have formed a

. conference during their tenure

which saw seven of its nine teams
make the Final Four at some

Shortstop Jay Bell is one of a select

point. In addition, the exposure
and revenue beneﬁts to the
conference and the schools
brought on by Gavitt have been
huge as the result of television. It
has helped solidify the Big East’s
respected national position.

But what happens now that
the visionary is gone? The old
saying goes, the whole is the sum
of its parts, and Gavitt brought
nine separate schools together
into one of the most powerful
basketball conferences in the
country.

Hopefully, Gavitt left a strong
enough foundation for the future
commissioner to work with,
which seems very likely.
Hopefully, the individual schools
that make up the Big East will

programs and produce players
which will further augmentthe

conference's strength. And
hopefully, the nine schools will

get further in terms of academic
and athletic goals in‘ order to
keep the common bond of the
conference a priority among the
entire group of schools, instead
of each university trying to meet
its own needs under the guise of
the Big East.

The Big East needs to remain
a forward-thinking conference.
It needs another man like Gavitt,
and it will probably not find such
a rare specimen. Thus, the
conference cannot afford to rest
on the laurels that Gavitt has left
behind. However, the Big East

V may have a few things in its

favor.

The nine schools have had
over 10 years to become a
successful, functioning
organization. Pitt’s director of

athletics, Ed Bozik, believes the
conference will survive and thrive
in the future based on the strength
of individual programs.

“I think it’s a real tribute to
Dave Gavitt, that the institution
that he helped to build [Big East]
is going to survive very nicely
without him. It’s a tribute to Dave,
but it’s also a tribute to the nine
member schools that the
conference is on a solid
foundation. And the walls are
not going to come tumbling down
because Dave left. A lot of what
has been accomplished is in place
and operating,” Bozik said.

He added, “We just concluded
an agreement which will be
signed shortly by CBS: a television
contract that takes us through

Too much information...

Bucs’ early right-handed hitting drought
proves to be a mere cosmetic concern

By Mike Rampa
Sports Editor

Since the Pirates have become
and remained the National League
East’s forerunner since April 22,
with the exception of one day on
May 26, every facet of their game
has come under close scrutiny.

With the instant information 6

and wealth of statistics provided
by the MLB-IBM Baseball
Information System, statisticians
and sportswriters have every
possible number for every
possible player on every possible
team available at their fingertips.
And what has become of this
technology? a
Translating the numbers into
plain English, an area of concern
that has popped up for the Bucs
has been the production from
right-handed hitters. Bobby
Bonilla is batting only .191 from
the right side, Jeff King is at .204,
Gary Redus, .206, and R.J.
Reynolds posts at .235 mark from
the right side. Of the other Pirate

righties with at least 90 at bats,
the lowest average is Jay Bell’s
respectable .272.

As of Sunday night, the team
average against left-handers was
.259 and .295 against right-
handers. _

However, information as it
appears on paper sometimes does
not translate into, real-life
accuracy. And several Pirates,
including manager Jim Leyland,
think those numbers may be a
simple case of too muc
information. i

“I feel real good about [right-
handed hitting]. I think Jeff King
is really starting to come around;
Don Slaught’s done a great job.
And Bobby Bonilla has yet to get
rolling right-handed. I think we’ll
do fine against right-handers. I
think we have done well,” Leyland
said.

The Pirates have faced some
premier left-handed pitching
around the league. Atlanta’s Zane

Smith and Tom Glavine, San r

Diego's Bruce Hurst and New.

York’s Frank Viola, to name a
few, have thrown a wrench into
the Pirates’ right—handed hitting
this year. And when the Bucs
finally face the Phillies on June
18, they will have even more
excellent left-handers to face.
“We haven’t played well against
left—handed pitching, but you can’t
say it’s because we don't have
right-handed threats. You can
look at any team and say they
don’t play well against left-handed
pitching. We’ve faced some pretty
good left—handed pitchers. People
can always look for things to say
[about] what’s wrong with a team.
“I guess the right-handers
haven't hit that many home runs
against left-handers because we’re
stronger against right-handed
pitching. But it’s still early,” said
first- base platoon man Redus.
“lSlaughtl has done great; he’s
swinging the bat real well. ’Ihey’re
looking for some other right-
handers like Ueffl King and myself
to produce, and I guess that's a

Former Pitt baseball player now major league prospect

By Scott Campbell
Assistant Sports Editor

Norfolk, Va., may seem a long way from
New York City -— 373 miles away, to be
precise — but it’s just a stepping stone

away for former Pitt football and baseball

player Chris Jelic.
Jelic, a member of the Tidewater Tides,

’ the New York %Mets’ top farm team based

in.Norfolk, is on the verge of becoming the
first Panther to reach the major le_agues
since pitcher Allan Lachowicz was called
up for a cup ',".fof coffee with the Texas
Rangers in 1983.

Jelic was a backup quarterback to John
Congemi for the Panther football team,
but his bulldog frame of 5 feet 10 inches
and 185 pounds prevented him from getting
any significant playing time other than on

special /teams. _ I

On the baseball diamond, he’s a catcher
by trade, a position more suited to his
build, but he has yet to don the tools of
ignorance this season because of a lingering
injury from last season. T hat’s given him a
chance to play first base, third base and
designated hitter this year. He’s also played
outﬁeld in the past, making him a truly
versatile asset, which should increase his
chances of making the Mets.

“The doctor said no catching until mid-
June, so I’m looking forward to getting
behind the plate again,” Jelic said. “I've
always hit well at every level, and now I
know a few positions, so I hope that will
make me more valuable if the time comes.”

This isJelic’s firstyear atTidewater, after
spending the past two and a half seasons
in Jackson, Miss., which has a class AA

team. His progress there was delayed
because of various little injuries, a torn
muscle in the rib, cage here, a sore elbow
there, but then last year, Jelic suffered a
baseball player’s nightmare -—- a torn
rotator cuff in his throwing arm. Hehad
surgery, which cut his season to 249 at
bats last year. A

Jelic was drafted in the second round of,

the 1985 draft by the Kansas City Royals
but was traded to New York with David
Cone for Ed Hearn, Rick Anderson and
Mauro Gozzo in March of 1987.

A career .263 minor-league hitter, Jelic
is batting .278 this year with two home
runs and 15 RBIs. He has slipped recently,
down from a high of over .300 about four
weeks ago, but once he gets his feet wet
behind the plate again, he can almost
certainly be a threat to be -called up at a

moment’s notice. The Mets have used five
backstops this year, but Barry Lyons,
Mackey Sasser, Orlando Mercado, Todd
Hundley and Dave Liddell are barely hitting
their weight, and no one in that group can
throw a snail out at second base.

“I think that if he hadn't hurt his arm that
he'd be up right now [with the Metsl,” said
Bobby Lewis, Jelic’s coach at Pitt. “He had
a major-league arm when he was here; he
can swing the bat, and he’s got better-
than-average speed for a catcher.”

Jelic, 26, has called Eugene, Ore.; Ft.
Myers, Fla.; Lynchburg, Va.; Jackson and
Norfolk home over the past ﬁve years. He
is approaching his golden years as a minor
leaguer, and he may only get one chance
to strut his stuff in “The Show.”

“You just hope it pays off in the end,” "

US.A. may stand a ﬁghting chance in World Cup Soccer

By Sean Heilman
Staﬁ" Writer

Italy is geared up and ready to
go as it prepares to host the
quadrennial celebration of the
most popular sport on the planet,
soccer’s World Cup.

The World Cup will consist of
52 games played in 12 Italian
cities over the next month, and
will begin Friday as defending
world champion Argentina takes
on Cameroon (noon, TNT
network).

The tournament will be
watched by nearly 30 billion
people. Close to one billion are
expected to watch the final game
July 8 in Rome. Those numbers
dwarf the World Series, Super
Bowl and the Olympics.

The world will cheer for its 9

teams with a passion that no
American sports fan has ever
equalled. Americans are relatively
apathetic when it comes to the
world’s most popular sport. By
the way, in case you didn’t know,
the United States is among the
24-team ﬁeld vying for world
soccer supremacy.

The United States has not
competed in the World Cup since
1950. The U.S. team went 1-2 in
its ﬁrst-round games that year,
losing to Spain, 5-1, and Chile, 5-
2. It defeated England, 1-0, in
what many international soccer
experts call the greatest soccer
upset in history. '9

has tuned up the Americans’
defensive play in the World Cup
preparation matches, in which
the United States went 7-5-2.
Defense maybe the United States’
strong point. Pak believes a strong
defense may give the American

team a fighting chance.

“It is easier to play defense
than offense,” he said. “It is easier
to break up an attack than build
one. But [opponents] may also
take the [United States] lightly.”

do not even give the Americans a &8,,y:9§&*,g3$£,.o.a,$5

chance of scoring a goal. That’s,\}

what happened to Canada in the‘
1986 World Cup in Mexico. They
were shut out in three games and,
eliminated. Some American
soccer experts feel the United’
States will fare much better than
the Canadians did in ’86. But the

Americans were also given a slim
chance of defeating Trinidad and

Tobago on the road to qualify for

the World Cup last November.

But they won, 1-0, on Paul

Caligiuri’s goal in the first half.

“If the [United States] plays like ‘

they are capable of playing,

anything can happen,” said Pitt-

soccer Coach Joe Luxbacher.

“I think they have played pretty
well lately. They dominated
against Ajax [Netherlands Club
champions; the United States tied
Ajax 1-1 on May 12 in Washington,
D.C.l.”

The average age of an American

compared to the rest of the teams.
That, along with the Americans’
relatively little experience on the
international level, has caused
experts to give the United States
a slim chance of winning a game.

The United States is anywhere
from a 500-1 to a 1500-1 longshot
of winning the World Cup,
depending where you place your
bet in London.

“Everybody is saying it’s a slim
chance for the [United Statesl,”
said former Pitt defender-
midﬁelder Heinz Pak. “It may be

true. You don’t just walk into the 2

second round of the World Cup

,3‘ after not being in it for 40 years.” 3

Soviets have one of the top teams

Sunday against Czechoslovakia
(TNT network, 11 a. m.).
Luxbacher believes the U.S. team
may surprise some people.

“The key for the [United States]
is to avoid early mistakes. They
have to gain some confidence.
The players will be in anunknown
quantity. They haven’t played any
games [like this]. The atmosphere
will be different. They will play
on foreign soil and the crowds
will be against them.

“If they are in the first game, if
they keep it close, they have a
chance. They can’t be nervous
and get out of their game.”

“I think if the score is tied at
halftime, the [United States] has a
good chance,” added Pak. “If
Czechoslovakia scores the first
goal, it will be hard for the [United
States] to adjust and come back.”

Cup play. Soccer fans are often
fascinated with their heroic
players, especially on teams that
are underdogs. Unique
personalities also gain fame for
the goalkeepers. Jean-Marie Pfaff
of Belgium was famous for stirring
up the crowds behind him during
the 1986 Cup, of which Belgium
reached the semi-finals. He was
also famous for dribbling the ball

little drawback right now,” Redus
added.-

Bonilla has been an absolute
terror as a leftie, posting an
excellent .360 average while
hitting 11 balls out of the park —
a far cry from his .191 average
with one homer as a right-hander.
He believes the team is doing a
decent job against 1eft—handed
pitching but thinks the Pirates
need to be more successful in the
future.

“There’s really not that much to
say. We’re managing and staying
aﬂoat against them, and that’s
basically what you want to do. 
We’ve done well against the right-
handers, but if we have our share
of wins against the lefties, we’re
going to do well,” Bonilla said.

The Pirates are in the middle of
a 28-game stint against the NL
East. So far, the Bucs are 10—8

I within the division and 30-19

against the NL West. The
confidence level on the club is

I _up, and Bonilla thinks that hitting,

right— or left-handed is going to
take a back seat in determining

 

   

wins.

“We’ve got to play in our
division; it’s nothing you can
avoid. I think every team in our
division is capable of winning;
it’s all going to come down to
pitching,” Bonilla said-

Leyland is critical of the crisis
situation that arises around the
city when his club loses one or
two "games, and emphasized that
confidence is a minor factor in
the long stretch against the East.

“We’re a good baseball team. I
think we spoiled a few people. If
we lose a game around here, it’s
a crisis. We lost two out of three
to the Expos —— that’s an excellent
team. I think our confidence is
very good. I think the confidence
of all the other teams is probably
just as good. I don't think that’s
going to be a factor. If we play
well enough, we’re going to win
our share of games. But it’s not if
you win ﬁve or six in a row and
you lose two out of three, and it
seems like everybody’s getting
excited about [the losses],”
Leyland said.’

Gavitt

Continued from page 8
1995. And we’re in the middle of
negotiations with ESPN, which
Dave will conclude before he
leaves, and we’re also negotiating
with Madison Square Garden so
we can continue to have our
[conference] championship there.
All these things have already been
done or [are] in progress and will
certainly survive Dave.”

Indeed those contracts will
survive Gavitt because they were
already negotiated when he was
commissioner. Butwhat happens
in 1995 when the lucrative
television contract runs ouﬁ What
happens when the ESPN contract
terms are up? The conference
needs an able man at the helm to
continue making television work
for the league as Gavitt did. Bozik
believes there are men to fill that
need.

“We have some athletic
directors, specifically Jake
Crouthamel of Syracuse, who has
been on the television committee
of NCAA football and basketball,
and is one of the most
knowledgeable athletic directors
in the country when it comes to
television.

“So [the Big East] isn’t
necessarily the product of one
man. I give all the credit in the
world to Dave for having the
vision to revitalize basketball in
the East and to recognize the
huge potential for television. ‘It
was a league created for
television, but it was a league that
was also built on some pretty
solid foundations,” Bozik said.

Television plays an important
role in the atmosphere of a game
in the arena itself. For example,
notice Fitzgerald Field House
when the Panthers are on national

TV. The numerous trailers
equipped with satellite dishes and
monitors outside, the temporary
set of blinding lights hooked up
above the floor, the media
personalities, the full house, etc.,
all make for a special atmosphere
abuzz with electricity. This
atmosphere is a positive image
for Pitt as it gives fans, alumni
and others the aura of a university
with a sports program of national
prestige. It may give the home
viewer exactly that impression
also.

But television networks don’t
want to cover mediocre teams or
ailing sports programs. The Big
East needs to make sure it does
not go that way. It must be a
concentrated effort among the
universities headed by a
conference commissioner who
has the insight to better the
interests of the Big East — a la
Dave Gavitt. The Big East must
remain a national power.

According to Bozik, Pitt plans .

to stay right where it is.

“I see no diminution in our
interest in the conference because
of Gavitt leaving; in fact, I don’t
see us as missing much of a beat.
Dave has been the very best at
what he’s done in the counuy;
there is not a more able
commissioner in the country. But
it’s because of what he has done
and what remains here; it’s an
ongoing organization.”

Let us hope that the
organization will continue to chart
new territory and develop as a
unit instead of resting on the
laurels that have been left behind.
The new commissioner must do
more than just take up the slack.

Anyone can hold the helm
while the sea is calm.

AIDS-T B D

By Lisa Oshop
For The Pitt News

Linda Troeller, a New Jersey
photographer, is not “merely” an
artist. Describing herself as a
social commentator, Troeller
attempts to create a “subtle,
extended documentary” on the
joys and crises of the human
condition. Her latest collection is
a series of photocollages
paralleling the tuberculosis and
AIDS epidemics, the former
hitting its peak at the turn of the
century, the latter at the end.

I found her exhibit on the
whole to be a provocative blend
of mixed media. Using diary
entries, poetry, magazine
pictures, x—rays and family
mementos, Linda Troeller creates
an individual life experience for
the “AIDS/T B patient” in every
photocollage.

In one collage, the patient
confronts in her diary the
institutionalization of her disease
and the way it extends even to
her own identity. At the center of
the piece stands the subject in
front of what looks to be a
glowing screen, looking down
and holding out her nightgown.

On her chest is a locust crawling
out of an egg. Next to the subject
is a photo of an aging, decrepit
woman in white, reclining on a
white lounge. To the subject’s
left," partially slashing across her
form, are three photo negatives
of patients in sanitarium beds. At

the top of the collage is the
patient’s diary entry: “My chest
empties  my chest. I am nursing
my chest. There is only a cavity
full of pus for the locust.” Saying
that she was “nothing before the
TB came," she quotes Aldous
Huxley’s BraveNew World, calling
herself, “bleached bones in
moonlight.” This depiction of the
loss of her identity, her humanity,

to the medical establishment is
eerily universal, especially
considering the medicalization of

In one of the AIDS
photocollages, Troeller deals with
the separation of the AIDS patient

him is a picture of a happy family
gathered around a dinner table in
celebration. Next to the family
photo is a photo of a smiling man
with the purple lesions of
Karposi’s Sarcoma dotting his
face. Voodoo masks litter the
man's photo and the corners of
the photocollage. The diary entry
is from the mother of an AIDS

petulant child’s role. Although a
solid performance from Barney,
it was quite a stretch to believe
that she was supposed to be 1 S or
that she was very excited.

Stellar performances delivered
by Sheridan Crist, Patrice DeGraff-
Arenas and Leonard Kelly—Young
are indeed what made The
Tempest a most memorable and
enchanting piece.

Crist as the deformed and
bonded Caliban simply delivered
the most energetic and lively
performance of the night. At no
time did Crist relent with his
character’s intensity or
believability.

His lithe movements coupled
with his relentless characterization
of a beast were beautifully
engaging. Crist’s performance
alone as the drunk monster
carressing a child’s blond dolly
should be a great impetus to see
the play.

Crist has performed with Al
Pacino and Martin Sheen in Julius
Caesar in New York and has
worked for City Stage Company
recently in The Oresteia.

DeGraff—Arenas as Ariel was a
lovely surprise as the playful spirit
under Prospero’s control. Not

movements and speech, her‘

throaty and rich voice was a
pleasure to hear as she sang. A

play, truly takes the audience to

beginning with a loud (very loud)
ship’s crash to its soft and muted
ending as Prospero begs the

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Wednesday, June 6, 1990

‘Young and Cage star in sputtering Fz'reBirds

By Matthew Myers
Smﬂ‘ Writer

With Top Gun faintly lingering

in our minds, it’s a wonder that

; Hollywood has taken this long to
come up with a genuine, ultra-
budget rip-off of the military-
training movie. This particular
bird, however, drops a big load
on financially—burdened
moviegoers.

Basically, Fire Birds sucks
mightily.

In a nutshell, Nicolas Cage and
Sean Young star in this Army-
sponsored dud as two chief
warrant officers training in the
Army helicopter task force.
Training them in the technical
ways of the Apache AH-46A (a
$10 million attack Copter with
enough high-tech hardware to
impress even Ronald Reagan) is
the hardened, militaristic Tommy
Lee Jones.

Once they have successfully
completed their training, cast and
crew must do battle with sinister

drug cartels in South America.
Foiled several times by a Copter-
flying Red Baron, they
nevertheless win and make the
world a safer place for our
children.

Without a spark of originality,
this film looks like a propaganda
piece for every public—service
organization this side of the
Atlantic. The viewer is immediately
aware of the movie’s efforts when,
during a smoke—filled board
meeting, Nick Cage stands up and
delivers a hokey, hackneyed
speech about what these drug
lords are doing to the kids on our
playgrounds.

Tell us, Nick, just what’s going
on in America? Not drugs! Not
that, Nicky!

And this picture contains some
real talent, man. Both Cage and
Young have played incredible
roles in their careers. Do they
need agents, or are they just plain
stupid?

And then there's Jones. This
good ol’ boy needs the two-by-

four treatment. His lines sound
like something out of an Army
recruiting ﬁlm. “Be the best,
boy. All-American!” Yeah, fight
for your rights to Springsteen,
blue jeans and Diet Pepsi.

No less than five people are
credited with the story, and it
shows. Every line sounds
absolutely ridiculous, and
they’re not playing for laughs,
although they certainly get some
yuks out of this horribly botched
script. “I just wanna be the best
 ﬁght for my country.” Vomit!

And then we are tortured with
these sappy, pseudo-
sentimental love songs from
Mister Subtlety himself, Phil
Collins. Why? Because director
David Green produced Collins
spectacular movie dud, Buster.
Reason enough to laugh out
loud.

By the end of this cinematic
garbage, we also have one of
the most confusing fight
sequences in movie history. Jon

could frighten or kill. This mystical
image is often imposed on the
AIDS patient by society —— and by
his family.

In general, the phrase “socially
conscious art” makes me cringe.
While I applaud the intentions of
the artist(s) in question, too many
times aesthetic values are
neglected in pursuit of getting
the message across.

This is not the case in the work
of T roeller, but I did perceive

A some flaws in the presentation of
her message. In none of her
photographs are the subjects
themselves infected with AIDS or
tuberculosis. . Her explanation
for this is her attempt to assign a
larger-than-life “mythic” figure to
emphasize that these are diseases
that may infect anyone. In
approaching these photocollages
as art, I forget that the artist is
trying to educate me. I can only
wonder: If this is, in the artist’s
words, “a subtle, extended
documentary,” why is it the
models look so healthy? To use a
stylized image in the name of a
documentary is a lie, and I could
not help but feel a little distracted
by this as I viewed the

photocollages.

A more minor problem that I
had with the exhibit was the way
the collages were hung. Despite
the fact that T roeller intended to
parallel the institutionalization of
the two diseases, the

photocollages with the TB ;

subjects were hung in one room,
and the collages using AIDS
subjects were hung in a second
room. Since the subjects were
segregated, the emotional
connection that I, the viewer,
should have made between the
two subjects failed to happen. It
would have been more immediate
and more unifying, I feel, to have
integrated the photocollages.

Despite these flaws, Troeller
handles the institutionalization of
AIDS and tuberculosis with
sensitivity and grace. Her exhibit,
designed to educate health-care
workers and lay persons alike,
challenges all of us to remember
that these are ultimately human
diseases.

“T B-AIDS DIARY” will be on
display at the Blatent Irnage/ Silver
Eye photo gallery in the South
Side. The show will run until
June 30. Gallery hours are from
noon to S p.m.
