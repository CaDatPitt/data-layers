, The debate over legalization of ._drugs inthe United States
A has become a smoking issue on Pitt’s campus.
Recently, Lambda Alpha Epsilon, a member of the Criminal
5 Justice Association debated on whether or not the prohibi-
1 tion of narcotics in the United States should end.
_ Two Pitt professors from the criminal justice department,
3 Dr. Jack Karns and Dr. Gus Martin, took sides in this debate.
T Karns, who supports drug legalization, said, “the current
‘ drug policy in this country is a prohibitionist and a moralistic
approach.”
~ “What right [does] the government [have] to tell people
‘  what they.can or cannot do with their lives, as long as they
‘ are not hurting anyone but themselves?” Karns said.
However, Martin said that the legalization of narcotics will
' only make existing problems worse.
I “lLegalizationl leads to increased casual use and increased
addictions,” Martin said. ' '
‘ Both speakers argued against the economic aspect of legal-
 izing drugs.

The fight to keep abortion
safe and legal is not over yet
because the Catholic Church as
well as Pennsylvania Governor
Robert Casey are serving to
undermine these rights accord-
ing to Mary Lipscomb Litman,
the co-President of the Squirrel
Hill chapter of the National
Organization for Women, who

period when a fetus begins to

Litman also spoke out against

Pitt’s International
Management Development
Institute recently received a
$1.5 million grant to address
a lack of international rela-
tions policies.

The Pew Charitable Trusts,
a Philadelphia-based nation-
al and international philan-
thropic organization, provid-
ed tlre grant.

The grant was created

because of a lack of interna-
tional relations policies in
Eastern and Central Europe
due to the collapse of the
Soviet Union, said Dr. Riall
Nolan, director of IMDI,
which is part of the Graduate
School of Public and
International Affairs.

“Most of these countries

real skill or capacity to devel-
op international relations

war in the areas {of health care
and rehabilitation.

Besides being a costly failure,
according to Karns the principle

‘behind the drug war is irra-

tional.

“Passing a law banning a_ prod-
uct in demand is irrational,” he
said.

Removing drug laws will not
succeed in decreasing .crime,
according to Martin.

- “[Legalizing drugs] will not take

out the criminal element
involved in the consumptioniof
drugs,” Martin said. “Because

‘ addicts will still rob to feed their
. habits and the black market will

still exist.” .

Another reason Karrrs said
he backs drug legalization is
that outlawing drugs is a viola-
tion of a citizen’s civil liberties,
an issue" which is taken up by
Marijuana
Prohibition organization at Pitt.
HEMP is a group whose goal is
to make marijuana and its prod-
ucts legal.

One o'f the only items that
Karns and Martin agreed upon
was the failure of the drug war.
However, Martin said, “the
legalization of narcotics is not
the answer.”

Instead of the legalization of
drugs, Martin called for a new
multidisciplinary approach to
ﬁghting drugs.

“We have to think of drugs as
a health problem, a law
enforcement problem and a
national security- problem,”
Martin said. _

Martin said his other
main problem with drug legal-

ization is that he does not

see a logical way to legalize
drugs.
“Legalization w.ill be costly and

complex. Deciding which drugs

become legal [will also be
hard],” Martin said.

“I would not buy it; I would
grow it,” said Steve Abate, presi-
de.nt of Pitt's HEMP. “And
making it legal would take out

make women feel guilty for having an abortion.”

“What right do we have to, make a decision for someone
else? We don’t have that right. All that we can do as a soci-
ety is supply the proper counseling for her _to make the deci-
sion that is right for her,” Litman said.“Women who regretted
having an abortion could have talked to an unbiased‘ coun-
selor who might have changed their minds. I-Iad there been
someone there in the beginning, they wouldn’t have died or
ended up in the emergency room.” She told the audience
that Casey’s decision to try to impose a 24-hour waiting peri-
od to have an abortion is “a joke for any woman going
through this. It is an insult to a woman’s integrity and intelli-
gence. No one wakes up one day late and runs down to
have an abortion. It is a very difficult decision for a woman
to make.” ‘ '

Litman described parental consent laws as “teenage
endangerment laws. These laws have nothing to do with
safety. All they do is make it more inaccessible for women to
have an abortion. This is oppression of women, not concern
for life  Reproductive rights are our cornerstone,” she said.

Since 1975 women have made greater strides in all profes-
sions and have done it for one reason, “because they have
the right tocontrol their reproductive destiny,” Litman said.

“In February of 1988, I had a hysterectomy. What did I
care [about abortion], I couldn’t have one. But if abortion is
legal in this country, then a woman should be able to walk
down the sidewalk to get an abortion without getting
harassed,” Pittsburgh pro—choice escort Susan Fisher said.

Board.”

Auerbach said she strongly
felt that the Elections Committee
did not handle the situation
properly and more should be
done.

“If he is not removed, then I
think that this is setting the tone
for all the candidates in the
years to come that they can
cheat and do whatever they
want because it doesn’t matter,
you can always get around the
rules,” Auerbach told SGB mem-
bers.

In her statement at the SGB
meeting, Auerbach said that
Pasquale was also guilty of the
same voting violations at Clapp
Hall, but that the Elections
Committee could not consider
the infractions because no for-
mal complaint was brought for-
ward.

Pasquale responded to the
allegations saying he was wait-
ing for a classmate to give her a
notebook.

“Someone working at the poll

‘requested 1 move to 100 feet

[from the poll],“ Pasquale said.

“And even though I wasn’t cam-
paigning, I thought it best to
comply.”

Pasquale was bothered by

the fact that all the Suther-
land votes were disqualified
because he said he really
didn’t have time to effect that
many. .
“I got [to Sutherland] at 6:30
and the poll closed at 7:00. I
could’ve only possibly affected
one or two votes,” Pasquale
said.

“In that sense, it would seem

like 74 people exercised the

Recall the zmporzama of C/gamer

Last Wednesday the elections for the 1994 Student
Government Board were held. Poll workers com-
plained to the Student Government Board Elections

Committee that President-elect Ross;-Pasquale.violated1j * 

the SGB election code; Hearings~—w'e’re ‘held on
Thursday during which Pasquale was found guilty of
campaigning within 100 feet of a polling booth. As a
penalty, he lost all votes that were cast for him at
Sutherland Hall, but those votes had no‘ effect on the
outcome of the race. The penalty also required public

disclosure, which was to be a joint statement issued by.

Pasquale and the Election Committee Chair, Deborah
Ryan. They were ‘ both out of town the weekend after
these violations came to light and wanted to release the
statement after they returned. However, the com-

plainants were not bound to this and revealed‘

Pasquale’s reprehensible conduct at Friday’s SGB meet-
ing; V

Pasquale had been warned ‘twice on election day
about this behavior. Despite these warnings, he contin-
ued to attempt to manipulate voters as they went into
the polls.

First responses to Pasquale’s actions have been nega-
tive. SGB President Jacob Brody said, “If you break the
rules in attaining office, how can people trust you?” Joe
Foner, a presidential candidate, accurately "described
the situation when he said, “I would not want someone

of questionable moral character to ‘represent me before

the university administration.” . V» _ V .

means with respect. The fact that Pasquale'was- warned ’
and continued his behavior makes him untrustworthy, 9

and the administration will treat him as such. _ _
The message this incident sends is that a person can
cheat and still get into office. His penalty says that "even
if an unethical person gets caught, they can still-win.
Pasquale should not be allowed to enter office under
these circumstances. One can only ask what he will do
when officially in office. ‘ A '

To remedy this situation, there should be another Q

vote, Pasquale may choose to run again, and then it will

be up to the students to decide if they want someone of _ .

this character representing them. There is still time
before the beginning of the next term. The students

“There must be something better they can do.
No one can want to sithere for over an hour
feeling like a tuna fish sandwich. Unless, of
cours'e, they’re crazier" than I am because I’m
actually doing it.”

Sound familiar? Well, if -“you were at Thackeray

Hall on Nov. 1, it should. I knew I was in for it-

.when I saw the line "around the corner, but noth-

‘ ing can describe the sinking feeling I got when I

but from a trustworthy source, I have discovered
that Penn State, which is bigger than Pitt, uses
phone registration. Perhaps I’ve found the stu-
dent’s salvation from First-Day-Registration.

wants to hear.-‘.'_that annoying - no, nerve racking -

purpose of making, the students’
lives a little easier. A

After all, they just spent a bun-
dle on the new food court in the
William Pitt Union and on new
vending machines in the Cathedral.

The lady who graciously took ‘the
sacred registration forms began making jokes to
calm the neives of the masses. Yet, somehow at
that point, I really didn’t want to hear how it
used" to be much worse. I mean, I’m here now
and know only too well my fate for the next
hour and a half. Is there nothing to ease the has-
sle, of registration? Is there nothing to end the
lines, the heat, the fear of your class closing the
minute you arrive" at the sacred cubicle? Will
nothing else work?

-  Phone registration could be the answer. Your
f_ firstthought might be, “Pitt is way too big.” Ah,

I can hear the administration asking,
how could a phone—registration system benefit
the University and what do those pesky students
want?

I don't want to sound like I expect Pitt to drop
everything and set up phone registration; there
are concerns of greater importance, such as
security on campus, etc. But I have this to say:
before you decide to put a pizza parlor on
Hillman’s roof that delivers by air, it is something
to consider.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, November 22, 1993

W93-'54 Panthers

to play two guard,” Antigua
said, smiling.

But do they?
. Aggelou and Maile are both
unproven commodities. Off-
guard Ahmad Shareef is streaky,
to say the least, and Garrick
Thomas, besides being ham-
pered for much of the presea-
son, is still a toss—up as to both
his position (two-guard or small
forward) and game (will the
much-ballyhooed high school
dunker put the ball on the ﬂoor
this year?). ,

Whether he has a high-scor-
ing season or not, an expected
constant is point guard
McCullough, who always seems
to get the job done — from
putting the ball in the hole or,
like in the Seton Hall game,
finding someone who can. .

And even if he doesn’t put the
numbers up like he did last sea-
son, he will have to be the quin-
tessential ﬂoor and locker room
leader on the team.

“I try to lead by example and

.not show anyone up,” he said.

“If something needs to be said
I’ll pull the player aside and talk
to him confidentially,”
McCullough said. _

Cauley has the potential to be
a huge positive both here and, if
things go well, in the NBA.

But, if he does not develop,

forward Chris Gant has shown

much improvement (not to
mention a lot more muscle and
ton of hops) since last year.

Gant and Cauley will set the
table and take a little pressure
off the man who is the unquali-
fied monster in blue and goldzl
Eric Mobley.

The outcome of this, Mobleys
senior year, will make or break
the Panthers’ inside game. The
NBA prospect will have to keep
his single-digit point and
rebound performances to a bare
minimum in order to keep Pitt’s
season aﬂoat.

Wl1iCl] brings us to Paul
Evans. ’

Entering the final year of his
contract to coach at Pitt, Evans
starts the ‘95-’94 season with his
future up in the air.

He has yet to receive a con-
tract extension from Pitt athletic
director Oval jaynes, much less
any semblance of an offer.

If Evans is to have any chance
to return to the ‘Burgh for the
‘94-’95 year -— assuming the
decision has yet to be made —
he must induce his strong, tal-
ented team to a successful sea-
son, both in the Big East and in
the NCAA tournament.

Can he do it?

Stay tuned the next four

months for the answer.

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Monday, November 22, 1993

Ha

Women's hoop team eyes respect, support in '93 —'94

Regional, local recognition‘ on the minds of Huemrich, Colabrese, Joyce and company

Byjack Becker .
Staff Writer

Jenine Joyce bent forward in
her seat at the vacated
Fitzgerald Field House, resting
an elbow on each knee as she
scanned the court and pon-
dered the upcoming season.

Joyce, a junior guard/ forward
on the women’s basketball
team, turned to teammate Jonna
Huemrich —— as if, she had sud-
denly stumbled upon a realiza-
tion — and voiced her conclu-
sion.

“You know we could do it

, this year,” Joyce said. “We could

win the Big East.”

The fact that Big East coaches
differ with Joyce’s opinion is not
lost on members of the team
who, in turn, are intent upon
netting some respect this sea-
son.

The Lady Panthers are aiming
to prove themselves not only to
Big East peers but to basketball
fans in the Pittsburgh area that
choose to ignore them.

In it’s annual preseason poll,
the Big East Conference coach-
es predicted the order of finish
for the 1995-1994 season. Pitt
landed in fourth place.

Being ranked fourth in a ten-
team league is not normally
cause for objection, but it is
when the fourth place team
maintained a 5-1 record last
year against the trio ranked
above them.

Connecticut, Providence and
Seton Hall, in that order, were
graded higher than Pitt. Only a
loss on the road versus
Connecticut kept the Lady
Panthers from sweeping last
year's six game set against those
three teams.

-“I’m just kinda tired of not-
getting the respect that we
deserve,” Pitt coach Kirk Bruce
said.

“They picked us fourth and
that’s nice, but we want to
prove that we are better than
fourth and that is what we are
out to do.”

“I honestly think we should
be higher,” Huemrich said.

No matter how high the Lady
Panthers should be ranked or
how well they fulfill an opti-
mistic season, they have diffi-
culty finding supporters to
crowd the stands.

The Lady Panthers averaged
231 fans per game last year.
That figure is approximately
7,834 short of what the Pitt

men’s basketball team averaged
— or slightly less than the
amount of people found at
Schenley Cafe during lunch
time.

Pitt takes offense to their lack
of fan support, especially con-
sidering the team—wide belief
that an entertaining product is
oﬂfered on the court.

“We don’t even get any
respect around here,” Huemrich
said.

“We don’t get any fans corn-
ing to the games.”

This season Pitt gets a crack at
earning all the esteem it desires
when, on December 4, it travels
to face the Vanderbilt
Commodores — ranked No. 1
in the nation. ‘

Vanderbilt will play host to
the Lady Panthers with none
other than colossus 610” All-
American Heidi Gillingham
roaming the pivot.

“I’m getting on her shoul-
ders,” the 6’0” Huemrich said
refering to the 5’9” Joyce.

“And that is how we’re guard-
ing her.”

“You don’t need to guage
yourself against the No. 1 team
in the country to figure out
where you are,” Bruce said. “It
gives our players a chance to go
against the best team in the
country.

"W11at’s wrong with that?
Everybody should want to do
that. It’s a big challenge.”

So the Lady Panthers set out
on the quest for appreciation
equipped with a few big—time
talents of their own.

Huemrich, a senior forward
from Bethel Park, averaged 18.0
points per game last year while
earning All—Big East honors.

* This year, Huemrich could be

gunning for the Player of the
Year award.

“I’m obviously biased I’m her
coach,” Bruce said, “But I know
basketball players and that girl
can shoot  I’m just gonna
come out and say it. Why am I
holding back? She is the best
player in the league.”

There is more to this team
than just Huemrich, however,
and Bruce will count on an
entire stable of solid guards to
support the play up front of the
versatile forward.

Joyce, Jill Colabrese and Erin
Malloy are almost interchange-
able at shooting guard and
small forward.

Combined they accounted for
18.4 points per game last year.

This year Bruce is looking for a
lot more from this experienced
group.

“The three of them had off
years last year,” Bruce said. “We
know they’re gonnabe a lot
better.”

At the point, rookie Joanne
"'JoJo” Guzman will push
incumbent Carol Morton for the
starting position.

Throw into that mix rookie
two—guard Erin Miller from
Oakland Catholic, whose shoot-
ing ability Bruce compares to
sharpshooter Sotiris Aggelou of
the men’s team.

“We have the best guards in

 

the whole league,” Bruce said.
“I know that.”

Along the front line is where
the question marks lie for the
Lady Panthers.

With the graduation of Turia
Ransom and the season-ending
knee injury to forward Julie
Fornadel, Pitt is thin under the
basket.

Carolyn Miller, 63”, and 62”
rookie Melissa Thompson will
fight for playing time at center
— a position Bruce says is up
for grabs at the present time.

Pitt may just be the deepest
team in the Big East and Bruce
is counting on that to help win a

few games. .
The biggest problem Bruce

might face is finding playing

time for everyone that deserves

‘ it, especially when St. Peter’s
. College transfer Isis Mitchell is

eligible in December.

“I feel very comfortable with
substituting anybody be it to
start or as a reserve,” Bruce said.
“We have 10 to 11 girls that can
start from game to game. That is
a luxury."

“We have more depth this
year than we’ve ever had.”

At seasons end, what the Lady
Panthers hope to have more of
than ever before is r-e-s—p-e—c-t.

The fire behind

By Ryan Buncher
Senior Staff Writer

When the Pitt women’s bas-

,ketball team takes the floor,

Panther head coach Kirk Bruce
starts stalking the sidelines.

The 40-year-old father of
three is shouting constantly.
The six-foot-four former Pitt
shooting guard scolds, instructs,
encourages and teaches con-
stantly -- and it is understood.

“Overall, he is on our side,”
senior forward Jonna Huemrich
said. “If I took every time he
yelled at me personally, I’d
probably be a basket case. I
understand that it is instructive.

The best thing about him is he ~

has things in perspective. He
understands that basketball is
not everything. The sun rises
tomorrow if you don’t win a
game”.

Bruce’s style has brought Pitt
steady improvement the last
few years. He is an intense
coach., but he is not trying to
win at all costs. He stresses
helping the pla-yers do their
best.

“I care about them,” Bruce
said. “I want them to make
every last shot.  to make
every pass they can make  to
look good all the time.

“'That’s for them, not me. I
have no ego — none.'I think
thats the way it should be. This
game is for them.” V

Away from the court, Bruce
said he wonders if he should
tone down his sideline talking.

“Every year, I tell myself- to
back off,” Bruce said. “Back off
and let them go, but this is my
job. I’m the coach. What I tell
them all the time is when you
stop hearing from me is when

Pitt women's bas

you’ve got a problem. If you

don’t hear from me, you know’

I've thrown my hands up —
which I neverdo.”

According to I-Iuemrich and
senior Jill Colabrese, a quiet

- Bruce sends a strong message.

“\Vli'en he gets quiet, we
know something is wrong,”
Colabrese said. “Then we start
talking. That’s one thing you
can tell — we did something
wrong." ~

The sideline banter also
brings some confrontations,
especially from I-Iuemrich. She
said she knows the talk is
instructive, but sometimes her
response is a searing glare.

“I've given him many of those
looks,” Huemrich said. “He’s

pulled me a couple times. Last 1

year, he pulled me  in the Big
East tournament against
Villanova. I game him a ‘leave

me alone’-look, and he pulled
me right out.”

Bruce said that there will be
differences and he will yell at
players, but once that moment
is over, it is forgotten.

“'Life.._.is too short. I don’t want
to get hung up with one of my
players on something that hap-
pened in practice."

Huemrich and Colabrese both
pointed to one moment last sea-
son that showed a lot about
Bruce. ' ' ’

The Panthers were fighting to
keep its post-season hopes alive
in a double-overtime battle at
Providence. Then a Pitt player
went down hard. It appeared
that Jill MacElhinny had been
pushed, and Bruce’s attention
shifted from the score.

“The_game was close -— dou-
ble overtime,” Colabrese said.
“He forgot, about it, being more
concerned with that play --

whether it was dirty or not.”-

“He was right in the refs face-

—— yelling that they’re going to
get someone killed out here,”

Huemrich said.

T-HE PI'lT NEWS, Monday, November 22, 1993

ketball: Kirk Bruce

Bruce is preparing for his
ninth year as the head coach of
Pitt’s women’s basketball team.
He said he is tired of his team
not getting the respect it
deserves. He is calling for fans
to come out to the games.

Once the team takes the court
for the season opener Saturday
against Duquesne, he will still
be shouting most of the game,
right up the the buzzer.
Afterwards, he will go to the
office to talk to whatever media
shows up and finish his work.

“I can leave the office and go
home knowing I did the best
job I could today,” Bruce said.
“And I leave it in [his office]. We
got things to do when I get
home. I have a family.

“I don’t want to get that
Bobby Knight syndrome where
I’m throwing the chair across
the court and I don’t realize I
threw the chair across the court
until it hits somebody. I want
them to get ‘something out of
their baskeball careers. I don’t
have to get anything out of it.
It’s all for them.”

The Pitt Ne

Head coach Paul Evans is in
his eighth year at the head
coach of the University of
Pittsburgh. He has complied a
134-84 record since coming
over from the Naval Academy,
in which he progressed as far as
the Elite Eight (1985-86) in the
NCAA Tournament and
coached NBA All-Star center
David Robinson.

Evans, who has received
much criticism since being
hired at Pitt for failure to
progress -in the Big East and
NCAA tourney, sat down in his
office and talleea’ to The Pitt
News on Friday, November I 1.

Pitt News: I don’t know how
much the Pitt community and
the city of Pittsburgh knows
about you personally so, in your
words, describe the type of per-
son you are, and describe your
coaching style.

Paul Evans: I guess I take a
fundamentalist approach — we
work on fundamentals and we
try and run a fast break type of
game that points a lot of points
that is not 11in-and—gun.

PN: As far as handling players
on a personal level 

PE: Well I think it’s a case of
trying to make every player

become the best they can be.
You look at someone like
Darren Morningstar a few years
back who people thought was a
joke to be here at this level, and
he’s starting for Dallas
[Mavericks] right now, so if you-
see someone who has potential
to make it to the next level you
try and get it so they can get the
most out of the situation that
can happen. -

PN:You seem to have a lot of
talent to come to Pitt, from
(Sean) Miller and‘ (Bobby)
Martin to (Eric) Mobley and
now (\Y/illie) Cauley. In your
words, why are you such a
strong recruiter?

PE: First of all, I think that
some of those kids are not as
good as some of the other peo-
ple [other teams in the Big East]
are getting, which is why we’re
not where we want to be yet,
basketball—wise. We’ve got a
problem here with facilities,
we’ve got a problem here with
some of the other situations that
exist indowntown Oakland, for
example as far as getting some
of the better white kids in ——
they come in and see Saturday
night down here with the police
standing out here with the dogs
and they are going to head off
to Duke or someplace.

The thing you can sell is the
Big East and the thing you can
sell is the television exposure,
and the city of Pittsburgh. Other
than that were lacking some
things. Some of the kids that
you mentioned were maybe not
the best recruits but we gave
them a situation where they
could come in and have a
chance to play where they
could have gone someplace
else and not played. 5 0 m e
people look at Sean Miller and
see what he‘ did here —— where
he ended up the leading free
throw shooter, the leading
three-point shooter, second it
the ‘Big East in assists, first here.
And then you take a kid like
lNorth Carolina two guard

Pitt men's basketball coach'Paul Evans.

Dante] Calabria who was actual-
ly ‘better than Sean and had bet-
ter statistics coming out of high
school, goes down to North

Carolina and hasn’t seen the

floor yet. So sometimes it’s the
situation that maybe you don’t
get the best kid but he gets a
chance to play.

PN: How has recruiting gone
so far for you this year?

PE: It hasn’t gone real well —
we've only got two scholarships

so we have been a little more

particular about who we have
brought in. The rules say a kid
can’t officially visit if he hasn't

passed the SAT until after the
early signing so a lot of the kids

that you would have had visit ,

by now who will probably pass
the test haven't passed it as of
yet so they can’t visit officially
until sometime next week.

PN: Do ‘you really recruit

. from the Pittsburgh area?

PE: We do when the kids are
available. Were not going to
recruit a kid to come, especially
a local kid, who’s not going to

play. If he’s going to come and_

sit on the bench, then you're
going to get a lot of bad publici-
ty and the kids not going to be

 

happy and he‘d be less happy
here because he’s got his peers
and his family who can see him
every place when he plays
whereas if he goes to an away
school and doesn’t play then it
doesn’t make much of a differ-
ence. We’ve been pretty partic-
ular about who we’ve gone
after in this area,_and we’ve lost
a couple of kids. Calabria could
have played for us, especially
when you look at us last year,
when we had trouble with our
perimeter shooting.

PN: What has been your
biggest accomplishment since
coming_._to Pitt? ,

PE: I think our two Big East
championships. The NCAA
(appearances) — being in there
five years. People look at it that
we’re in there we should have
been in there all the time. Well,
if you look through Pitt history,
they’ve only been there ’six
times previous to that, so this
has not been " a basketball
school, and it’s been a fight to
get it to the level that it is at.
People still aren’t happy with it,
but for what we’ve got going for

us — some of the situation we
have — it’s been a pretty good
accomplishment to get there
five times.

PN: What has been your
biggest disappointment?

PE: I think the recruiting has

. been the biggest disappoint-

ment. We’ve been right there
with a lot of kids who could
have turned the pro'gram
around and gotten us to the
next level that we could be at. I
think that some of the others is
the attitude around here. You
bring a kid to campus and you
have kids booing in the stands
or Golden Panthers‘ even who
want to see us at the next level,
but itdoesn’t help the kids or
the coach staff. I can remember
our first year here when I saw
that john Congemi, who was
one of the nicest guys in the
world, getting booed. They just
don’t realize not only how that
hurts that kid, but how it hurts
the program, especially if
there’s a local kid, when there’s
probably someone in the stands
everything you step on the field.

COME JOIN US AT THE AREA’S NEWEST AND FINEST

By Brett Fondrk
Staff‘ Writer

For the past few seasons, Pitt has been
searching for outside shooting. Injuries,
lack of depth, and inconsistency have
plagued the Panthers’ guards.

But this year may be different.

Coach Paul Evans may have finally
found the player to solve these. prob-
lems.

Is he from New York? Chicago? Los
‘Angeles?

How about Greece? Kind of.

Rookie guard Sotiris Aggelou could be
the sharpshooter Pitt has needed for the
past few years. Aggelou is a native of
Greece. He came to the United States in
September after Gus Sariandes, athletic
director at the American School in
Athens, Greece, contacted Metro Index
scout Joe Butler about sending Aggelou
to participate in the prestigious Metro
Index Basketball camp _in California, Pa.

He played a year of basketball in
United States at Riverside High School
(Pa.), where he averaged 25 points while
leading the Panthers to a 17-6 mark and
their first playoff appearance in years.

Aggelou brings instant offense to the
team. He possesses a deadly outside shot

‘and holds the Riverside High school

record with 66 three-pointers in only 23
games. He is dangerous from any area of
the court and has almost limitless range.
Last season, he won the three—point con-

test at the Dapper Dan Roundball classic.

“I love to shoot the ball,” he said. “I
would rather pull up and shoot a three
than dunk.” I o

That’s something that Pitt fans should
love to here. Last season, Big East oppo-
nents played zone defense in the latter

part of the season. By -playing zone, the
opponents attempted to neutralize the
inside play of Eric Mobley and Chris-
McNeal. The Panthers were forced to

shoot from outside. Pitt was 13-2 at one
point, but ended the season with a dis-
appointing loss to Utah in the first round
of the NCAA tournament.

  

THE PI'IT NEWS, Monday, November 22, 1993

for long—range help

Aggelou thinks he can help change
that.

“I just want to play and help the team,”
he said. “They brought me here because
I can shoot the ball. When I get the
chance to play, I think I can hit my shots
and help us win.”

Aggelou fine-tuned his skills over _the
summer and has worked hard to
improve his game.

“I played in a Greek club league over
the summer,” he said. '

He also has worked on his strength,
something that is necessary to be suc-
cessful in the Big East.

Aggelou is listed at six-foot-three—inch-
es and 180 pounds. However, he gained
15 lbs in muscle over the summer.

One of the raps that come with being a
greatlscorer is that they can’t play
defense. Aggelou is no different.

“They brought me here to score,” he
said. “But I think they were surprised
that I can play defense too.” ’

And what about the increased empha-
sis on the transition game that Pitt is
stressing this year?

“They want me to run the floor and
score off the fast-break,” he said. “I like
to pull up and hit three.”

What about the low ranking that the
Panthers received in the preseason polls?

“They have no respect for us,” he said.
“I think we’re going to prove a lot of
people wrong.”

Aggelou, who was recruited by a num-
ber of schools, is happy with his deci-
sion to attend Pitt and stay in the United
States.» _

“I’m here because I like it ,” he said.
“Everyone has helped me out. The peo-
ple have been really nice.” ‘ I -

“But I do miss home.”

Here is a team-by-team pre-
view of the 1995-94 Big East
men's basketball conference.

(Order of teams reﬂects The
Pitt News preseason poll.)

1. Syracuse

The Syracuse Orangemen
head into the 1993-94 season
free, again. "The Orangemen
spentlast season on NCAA pro-
bation, going 20-9 during the
regular season. This season, the
Orangemen have a starting five
that rivals any in the league.

Lawrence Moten (17.8 ppg),
the league’s top returning scor—
er, is a explosive offensive play-
er who loves the ball at the end
of‘ the game. He’ll play off-
guardthis season. Adrian Autry
(13.7 ppg, 5.6 apg) joins Moten
in the backcourt.

Up front power—forward John
Wallace comes in bigger and
bulkier. Lucious-Jackson will
play small-forward for . the
Orangeman. R€ClSl1ll't freshman
Otis Hill will play center.

The Syracuse bench is weak.
The Orangemen will get min-
utes for forward Scott McCorkle
and guard Lazarus Sims.

2. Georgetown

1992-93 was a season that
John Thompson would like to
forget. The Hoyas finished
under .500 in the Big East for
the first time in school history.

VVhy? Youth.

The Hoyas started two rook-
ies. They didn’t even have a
senior on the roster. The good
news is that everyone is back.

The -‘leader of: the pack is»

Othella Harrington. The 6-10
center averaged 16.8 ‘points per
game and pulled down an aver-
age of eight rebounds.

Power forward will be han-
dled by 6-10 sophomore Duane
Spencer, a versatile player who
can play both inside as well as
on the perimeter‘. Robert
Churchwell averaged 11.5

' points a game and will start at

small forward.
Junior John Jacques, sopho-
more Eric Micoud and junior

Irvin Church will all see time at.

shooting guard.

Senior point guard Joey
Brown will be looked upon to
provide leadership and scoring.

The Hoyas will play their
usual strong defense but.they
will have to improve their dis-

mal .396 percent shooting per-
centage if they hope to avoid a
repeat of last year.
- Brett Fondrla

3. Connecticut

The Connecticut Huskies are
seeking a return to form this
year, and with 6-9 All—American
candidate Donyell Marshall

around to lead the way, they —

should do just that.

The 1992-93 season (15-13
record) was a drastic slide‘ in
performance from the three pre-
vious years (71-27 record, Big
East championship, NCAA Final
Eight and Sweet 16 berths).

“Marshall is one of the most
skilled players I’ve ever had
with someone his size,” UConn
head coach Jim Calhoun said.

Calhoun hopes to be able to

I play Marshall at small forward,

but will probably have to keep

him under the basket more. In _

the backcourt, junior two—guard
Brian Fair needs to- develop
some moves to the hoop to go
along with his streaky shooting.

Calhoun is very high on Israeli J

import Doron Sheffer at point.

“It’s gonna be hard not to find
time for him,” Calhoun said of
Sheffer. “He’ll play a lot.”

If Connecticut is able to force
turnovers with its pressure
defense it could easily finish
higher than the pre-season
ranking of fourth. '

4. Boston College

Three years, no NCAA tourna-
ment berths

Once again, the Eagles look
good on paper — good enough
that the Big East coaches voted
them second in the '93-94 poll.

In the past, the three-guard
set of Howard Eisley, Gerrod
Abrams and Malcolm Huckaby

‘ destroyed defenses from the

outside. When they didn’t, the
load fell on Curley (15.8 points
per game, 7.5 rebounds).

Now head coach Jim O'Brien
may be scrapping the three
guards despite the fact that BC
had trouble filling two front-

court spots, much less three, last
. year. Paul Grant stepped in at l

the other forward last season,
but tailed off late, as did most of
the team. Curley is still the only

Depth shouldn’t be a problem
either this. season. Chris Gant
apparently has worked on his
game in the off-season, because
he is playing with a new vean-

and Cauley, Pitt has a strong
forward nucleus. Eric Mobley
will be a force at the pivot.

  -z'tt’sl heart-and-soul captain:

Byjason Brame
Asst. Sports Editor

Orlando Antigua stands at the
free_—throw line like a character
pulled right from “The

I Outsiders.”

Right arm sleeve yanked up
over his shoulder, Antigua’s
.undershirt might as well house
a pack of Lucky filters. His
scraggly ‘tee and side—shaven
‘do highlight a face that seems

. to fit this street-wise kid from da

Bronx very well.

Antigua is a junior, in his third
year with head coach Paul
Evans and the Pitt Panthers. He
isn’t as glamorous as some of

the other stars that have matric-
ulated through the system —
the Bobby Martins, the Brian
Shooters, the Chris McNeals —
but Antigua possesses a Valu-
able characteristic that has
helped him climb from deep in
the bench to a starting spot as a
freshman and fan favoritism in
his three years:
Grittiness.
Intensity.
Heart.

. “That’s just the way I am,”
Anituga said about his animated
play on the basketball court. “I
get like that a lot. Matter of fact,
when [recruit] Bob Lazor was in,
we were at Coach. Evans’ house

andme and my brother were
watching the ‘Pitt/Rutgers game

and when I get into it, I get into -

it. I jump up when they score a
touchdown. My brother’s the
same way — guess it’s just in
the blood.”

Antigua, who has grown
accustomed to barking out ver-
bal pats—on-the—butts in his short
career, has made strides since
coming over from . St.
Raymoncl’s High School in New
York City three years ago.

Critics have said that he hasn’t
lived up to his sChool—boy repu-
tation, but Antigua, who aver-
aged 4.8 points and 1.5

rebounds per game last year, is‘

still adjusting to life outside of
the paint.

A center in high school, he
played virtually 100 percent of
the game with his back to the

basket.

“I was always in the paint, so
my first two years here was get-
ting acljusted to playing the
three [small forwardl,” Antigua
said. —

Playing in the hotbed of high
school hoops, Antigua had the
“opportunity” to play against
vaunted high school stars
Shawnelle Scott (now starting at
St. _Iohn’s), Adrian Autry

(Syracuse) and Brain Reese-

(North Carolina).

Oh, yeah, and some dude
named Mashburn.

“I tried to guard [Jamal]
Mashburn a little bit — every-
body tried to guard Mash —— but
he was tough,” Antigua said of
the former Kentucky Wildcat
and now Dallas Maverick star.
“He was hitting fall-away three-
pointers, so they put me on him
and he’d take me outside,
they’d put the small forward
and he’d take them inside. It
was tough to match up with it.”

In the three years since he left
NYC, Antigua has watched his
game improve from the turn-
around jumper to having confi-
dence with the ten—footer to tak-
ing it outside beyond the three-
point stripe for a big three.

“I have progressed since my
freshman year, I have gotten a
little bit better since my fresh-

man year,” he said. “There is a

lot of stuff that I have to learn
and a lot of stuff that I have to
do but it’s just going to come
through playing and paying
through all the mistakes and
hopefully the coaches will have
patience with me enough to
play through my mistakes."

The biggest aspect of his
game that still torments him,
however, is the one he had to
do least in high school — pass-
ing and putting the ball on the
floor.

“Learning how to pass — I’m
still having trouble making the
correct passes at the correct
time,” he said. ‘‘I’m still learning
and the coaches are bearing
with me.”

Aside from being named team
captain as a junior, Antigua also
garnered the starting position
that he enjoyed 18 of 31 games
his freshman year, and several
times last year, including once
at the two—guard spot against
Georgetown — which he
received both because of his
torrid shooting and his team-
mates’ inability to drain the out-
side J’.

“I think we have enough guys
who can ‘shoot the guys from
outside that they don’t need me
to play two guard,” Antigua
said, smiling. “I started a couple
of games my freshman year and
that’s where all the pressures at.
Now it’s just coming out and
playing ball and having fun
doing it.”

Big East championship rig top

By Brady Slater
Staﬂ Writer

(Second ofa two-part story on
P1‘ttju.m'or college transfer
tr‘/1'1/re Cauley.)

And. now Willie Cauley is
here. He’s here because he said

"he needed to get back to the

city and away from the trouble
that found him in a little town
like Dodge City.

“I have to come in and stay
out of trouble,” he said. “The
whole clause of me coming to
Pitt is to stay out of trouble. I
have a tendency to have trouble
written on my back; I don’t
know why.

“I don’t mess with wild peo-
ple, gang members or anything
like that," Cauley said.

"I’ve just been getting in trou-
ble all my life. I’m hoping it
don’t; I’m praying to God it
don’t happen here. That’s all I
need is to get in trouble at
Pittsburgh.”

Cauley turned down Illinois

_ to come to Pitt because he said

he’d rather play in the Big East
than in the Big Ten. And he
comes to Pitt as a mystery.
Rumors abound about his bas-
ketball abilities. Brad
Underwood, Cauley’s coach at
Dodge Citygjunior College,
addressed what is probably the
most traveled rumor about
Cauley. e

“Other college scouts, proba-
bly unfairly, but probably most
accurately see him and say he’s
Larry Johnson with a jumper,”
Underwood said.

It’s a comparison that puts a
big smile on Cauley’s face.

‘‘I hope, I hope I’m another
‘Larry. I’m working on it, believe
that,” he said.

Believe him, he’s working on
it. He is one of the first players
to arrive at the Fitzgerald
Fieldhouse before practice and
the last player to leave the ﬂoor.

“Those little 15 minutes after
practice; they count,” he said.

This from a man who said he
hates practice.

"So much so that he "said that
he would try to get kicked out
of practice on purpose in high
school. _

“I wouldn’t characterize him
as a practice player, but he’s
done everything he’s been told
to do,” said Pitt Assistant Coach
Joe DeSantis, who originally
recruited Cauley out of high
school when he coached at
Duquesne. “He’s even been
playing hurt. I know for a fact
he has a bad knee, but he
doesn’t tell anybody!’

He doesn’t tell because it’s

not bad enough to'keep him-

from playing. Cauley is a man

to be good. To live up to my
name, I have to be good.”

For Pitt to have a good sea-
son, Cauley is going to have to
step into a Panthers’ frontcourt
that lost Chris McNeal and
Antoine Jones. Cauley said the
coaches are looking for him to
average double figures in points
and rebounds.

And he knows that he won’t
be playing every position like
he did in high school and junior
college anymore. He also
knows that few, if any, of his
points will be coming from
beyond the three-point line, a
place he grew fond of in high
school and junior college.

“'I’m going to make a living
around the basket,” he said.
“When I get down there, me
and the basket are like a magnet
to eacl:—sotl1er‘.”

stops and looks up puzzlingly at
the basket every time he misses

9 a shot in practice.

And when Cauley talks of
making a living around the bas-
ket, he doesn’t just mean scor-
ing a lot of points. He means it
literally.

“Everything is a business to
me on the basketball court,” he
said. ‘Tm trying to get paid. I’m
trying to just play basketball for
the next 15 to 17 years.”

\Y/hile his stop at Pitt may be
just a stepping stone into the
National Basketball Association
for Cauley, he is not just moti-
vated by individual success.

“I’ve been waiting for two
years to get into the Big East,”
he said. “I want to leave with a
Big East championship ring on
this finger, and who knows,
maybe a national championship
ring on this finger.”

Coontinued from page H-5
So I think the atmosphere hasn’t
"been as positive as you want it
to be.

PN: Pittsburgh isn't, by any
stretch of the imagination, a
good basketball city. lOrlando
Magic point guard] Scottskiles
said last year that basketball is
like church — many attend, few
understand, and I think that that
can be applied to the city. How
much of the criticism that you
and the team have taken is from
just a lack of understanding and
a lackof-knowledge rather than
something that is warranted?

PE: I think a lot of it is. You
look at some of the criticism the
coaching staff has as far as
being too tough on some of the
players. The reality is that if we
are that tough on them, why
isn’t anyone transferring out of
here? We’ve had the best trans-
fer rate probably than anybody

in the Big East, so I don’t think
that the kids are unhappy as
[the public] thinks and I don’t
think that the people see the
kids practice. Sometimes we’ll
make a substitution and they’ll
get upset because you made
that substitution, but maybe
they don’t realize that that kid
hasn’t worked for two days in
practice. I think a lot of times,
because you’re close to the situ-
ation and, like you said, they
think they know more about it
than they really do and they
really, without being at practice,
don’t realize what’s going on.

PN: You took a Navy team to
the Final Eight with David
Robinson. Even though you
haven’t gotten that far in.the
Tournament-with Pitt, have you
had the success that you
thought you’d have at Pitt?

PE: The last team I left there
was a very unique team in that

just Robinson — we had a kid
that, had we had a three-point
arc, would have been an All-
American at that time; we had a
point guards that was so
unselfish that didn’t care if he
everscored as long as he gave
the ball up. Everybody was on
the same page, although none
of them was the athletes that
some of the kids that I have
now are.

Now you got kids with a little

more ego involved or whatever ’

that haven’t been able to fulfill
their roles as well. I think that
this team this year, if they fulfill
the roles, they will surprise
some people that have us out of
it — they have us as a ninth-
place team. I think that they are
gonna be ‘better than that and
that’s one of the ways that they
can be better than that — if they
fulﬁll their roles.

PN: What are your expecta-
tions this season? Is this going to
be Orlando’s break—out year?
What are you looking at from
Eric ...? -

PE: Well, Eric can be as good
as he wants to be. He’s like the
nicest kid in the world, but he
doesn’t work nearly as hard as
he needs to to get where he
should want to go. It’s a situa-
tion that if he wants to work

aT-HE PI‘I'»l‘~NEWS~,~Monday,\=November"22, 1993

and he wants to put in the time,
he is going to be as good as he
wants to be. If he doesn’t he’s
not going to be much better
than he was in the past.

PN: What has he done over
the summer?

PE: Not much. He went to a
couple of camps, but the camps
don’t do much if you don’t do
all the rest of the work along
the way. He has, in the pre-sea-
son, gotten himself into better
shape and in this past week he
worked pretty:hard for three
days of practice. Eric and I
talked about it last night — those
three days were the first time
probably ever that he had three
days in a row where he worked
real hard. If he continues to do
that he’ll be alright.

Orlando is stronger, shoots it
better but needs to work on his
ball—handling. T hat’s his biggest
problem and it has been since
he got here because he was a
center  in high school.

PN: As far as intensity, I think
that he is the most intense and
energetic player on the ﬂoor.

PE: He definitely was until
this year. We got a kid now,
Sotiris Aggelou, that’s a worka-
holic. We need to get him and
Orlando to get some of the
other guys — like Eric — inten-
sity up. Willie’s tough, too.

PN: You haven’t had the
greatest success in the Big East
tournament for in the NCAA
tournament. I know every year
is an isolated team or an event,
but is there any reason that you
can give for these problems?

PE: I think sometimes it’s con-
fidence, sometimes it’s where

. you’re seeded and a lot of it’s

luck. You look last year —

Temple’s gotta be out in the

second round, but then Santa
Clara, or whoever the hell it
was, beats Arizona. You take
like a 14th or 15th seed knocks
off the two-seed and you’re the
lucky team that gets to play that
team, whereas a week before
that you were think were play-
ing Arizona, and you were
packing to go home but now all
of a sudden you’re playing
Santa Clara, so there’s a lot of
things you need to have a break
come from.

_PN: Some former players
have said that your coaching
style is too abrasive for the col-
lege game. You have what hap-
pened to Lou Campanelli last
year getting fired out at Cal and
Todd -Bozeman comes inand
he’s a little more personable.
Overall, in your situation, are
the players just less tolerant?

PE: The players are less toler-
ant but the press and the media
makes more of it and the boost-
ers side with the kids and it
ends up where there are too
many people that have too
much to say. Let’s see how
Todd Bozeman does when he
has to start the beginning of the
season. Lets see how good a
friends he is at the end of this
year. He goes into a situation
where there’s no clown-side.

It doesn’t matter where you
are, there are nights when kids
would rather be someplace else.
There’s probably five coaches in
the Big East that are tougher on
the kids than I am, [but] that’s

what people like to talk about

around here. In reality it hurts

because the kids start to believe-

it. It takes somebody like Sean,
who goes away with one of the
European teams and played
with Roy Williams or P].
lCarlisimo], to come back and
say “jeez, these people are
maniacs.”

PN: How is your relationship
with the Golden Panthers and
the administration? ,

PE: I think it’s alright. In this
profession you’re never going
to have everyone liking you and
you’re going to have as many
who think you’re great as think
you’re the worst coach in the
world. It’s a no-win situation,
and that’s why you can’t worry

' about things like that.

PN: Correct me if I’m wrong,
but is this the ﬁnal year on your
contract? A

PE: I’m not going to comment
on that. _ ‘

PN: There has been specula-
tion as to whether or not you’re
be back next season." Where do
you stand with [Athletic Director
Oval] Jaynes?

PE: I think you’d have to ask
him.

F 7. St. John’s

Last season, St. Jol1n’s stunned
the college basketball world
with a second-place ﬁnish in the
Big East, a 19-11 record and a
trip to the second round of the
NCAA tournament.

What a confidence builder for
a first-year coach Brian
Mahoney taking the place of the
legenary Lou Carnesecca?

“I think I have more confi-
dence in myself,” Mahoney said.
“Last season, I was unsure of

how we could get these kids to”

work hard and improve.”

This year, Mahoney might
have a tougher job than replac-
ing Carnesecca. The Redmen

Providence didn’t go to the

they deserved to. Nonetheless,
the Friars are back this year with
four starters returning, and a

Smith averaged 11.8 points
last year, but more impressively
averaged 11.4 boards to go

Miami may have been the

but no more. The Hurricanes
have four starters from last year
retuming to the team.

Steve Edwards, the six—foot—
four-inch sophomore shooting
guard,.§:s the team’s best shoot-
er.‘ Although he is back,
Edwards is coming off minor
off-season knee surgery.

Point guard Michael Gardner
will also return and will likely
run the show again in ‘93-’94.
He will be facinga battle with
Steve Frazer to start. Frazier, a 6-

his 13.7 points and 4.3 boards a

East’s Michael Jordan, but he
had the skills and head to domi-
nate a game.

The ‘Cats have two starters
returning: point-guard Jonathan
Haynes and talented ‘tweener
Kerry Kittles.

The biggest plus on the squad
will be the addition of center
Jason Lawson, a six-foot—11—inch
center from Philly. The highly-
touted player runs the floor

well, but needs a little work in '

the offensive end.

Nolan explained that the pro-
gram will beneﬁt countries such
as Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary,
Poland, Russia and Ukraine, in
one of two ways.

First, the ECE countries will
be supplied with computer soft-
ware, computer hardware, data-
base materials and network
capabilities, Nolan said. This
will increase their communica-

tion with one another, with
international information net-
works, as well as with the inter-
national community of ‘experts
in their region and the United
States.

Second, the program will
develop on-site training within
the regions to educate the coun-
tries in current international
relations policies and informa-
tion management systems, he

said.

It will basically teach them
“how to run their institutes,”
Nolan said. The program’s goal
of building competence in insti-
tutions will result in compe-
tence in individuals. This will in
turn strengthen the international
affairs and training within each
country, according to Nolan.

Although these objectives
may be easily envisioned, the

program which will implement
them has been on the drawing
board for more than two years,
he said“:

‘.‘This grant recognizes the
American interest in the intema—
tional affairs effectiveness of the
ECE nations in the post-Cold
War world,” GSPIA Dean Davis
Bobrow said. He said sending
Americans, which are affiliated
with the program and the

Association of Professional
Schools of International Affairs,
in order to implement the
equipment and training pro-
grams is only one side of the
coin. The other side involves
funding approximately two

to”work on vital international
affairs projects with their
American counterparts.

Seton Hall for
Big East title

By Ryan Buncher
Senz'or‘Staﬂ" Writer

PHILADELPHIA —— In the
first two rounds of the Big East
volleyball tournament, Pitt
stuck to a winning script for a
sixth straight conference title,
easily running Boston College
and Villanova out of Jake
Field House in
Philadelphia. _

Seton Hall tried to manufac-
ture a late rewrite in Sunday’s /
championship match, pound— ‘
ing the Panthers in the first

two games.

/

“[The Pirates] were crushing .
balls,” Pitt Coach Cindy Braziel
said. “After losing that second
game, the girls thought we I
were still in this thing. Before -
the game we said, ‘whatever
happens, we can come back‘ ’j
because of the things we do 8
well.”

The Panthers (23-9) did
enough things wellto crush
Seton Hall in the third game.
on This lead the way to a ﬁve-
game win, Big East title num-
ber six and an automatic bid
to the National Collegiate

pp Athletic Association tourna-

ment.

There was no such suspense
Friday night, as Pitt outside
hitter Ann Marie‘Lucanie col-
lected another award. The
senior from Don Mills, Ontario
became the first athlete in Big
East history to win Conference
Player of the Year three times
in any sport.

The Pitt volleyball team celebrates its sixth straight Big East championship.

There was also little. drama
Saturday morning as Pitt dis-
mantled traditional Big East

doormat Boston College (0-8

in the conference).

“We didn’t play.down "to _

their level, which is pretty
hard against Boston College.
We had three goals coming
into this,” Pitt assistant coach
Brian Begor said. “One was to

win. The second was [to be]
injury-free; The third was to
ball—handle well.”

The Panthers rolled to 15-1

' and 15-4 victories in the first

two games. Pitt rested two‘ of
its top hitters, Lucanie (eight
kills) and rookie Jennie
Driscoll (seven kills), for the
third game and still rolled to a
15-7 win.

“It was a chance to get two
of our more physical players
some rest,” Begor said. “We
also got [rookie] Laurie
lFernandez, who. replaced
Lucaniel some Big East tourna-
ment: experience.” '

‘ PHILA_DELPHIA — Saturday
_afternoon’s football game at
Veterans Stadium between the

' Temple Owls and Pitt Panthers
' proved to live up to its billing.

i_Both teams went into the
game mirroring each other in
every single category.

‘But as the final gun sounded,
the fine running of junior run-
ning back Curtis Martin set the
teams apart, and the Panthers
won their season finale, 28-18.

After struggling for three and
a half quarters, Martin received
a phone call from his position
coach telling him to go out
there and put it together.

Atthe 4:59 mark in the fourth
quarter, the Panthers never
looked back as Martin took a
hand-off, scampered through
the line of scrimmage and got a

C . key block from wideout Bill

Davis. The rest was pure histo-
ry, as Martin shifted gears and

outran Temple defender Kyle .

Glasper on his way to an 80-
yard touchdown.

“My performance was very
poor in the first three quarters,”
Martin said. “I just-wanted to
put something together in the
fourth and put the game away.”

Martin’s' touchdown gave the
Pittsburgh native 167 yards for
the game — 1,075 yards this
season. _

In the first half, the Owls,
under the leadership of first-
year coach Ron Dickerson,
opened up with a 10-0 lead in a
game where nobody was able

. to hold on to the ball.

After committing numerous
penalties, the Owls started to
self—destruct, giving
Panthers the ball with first-and-
goal on the one-yard line.

Two plays later, Billy’ West
plowed up the rniddlefor a

o

the ~

one—yard touchdown, giving Pitt
the momentum going into the
locker room during halftime.

In the second half, the

‘Panthers began to play mistake-

free football en route to scoring
two unanswered touchdowns in
the third quarter.

But with 4:54 left to play in
the game, the Owls tried to
make a comeback when first-
year quarterback Henry-Burris
threw a ‘six-yard touchdown
strike to tight end George
Karayiannis.

Burris then successfully
completed the two-point ‘Con-
version to the wide-open Danny
Davis, makingit Pitt 21, Temple
18. On the very next play from
scrimmage, Martin stole the
show with his 80-yard scamper.

“There is nothing like win-
ning," Majors said. "It’s good to
go into the holidays and into

recruiting with a victory under

your belt.”

Seniors Jill Colabrese and
Jonna Huemrich teamed for
45 points as the Pitt Lady
Panthers defeated the
Moscow Dynamo, 82-69, in
exhibition play’ at Fitzgerald
Field House yesterday."

Colabrese paced Pitt in the
first half by nailing down 17
points — including 3-for-3
from three-point land — on
the way to a 22-point perfor-
mance.’

Huemrich took over in the
second half as she scored 14
of her game-high 23 points.

“J.C. and Jonna lit it up,”
Pitt Head Coach Kirk Bruce
said.

Colabrese and Huemrich
played tag team as the Lady
Panthers’ scoring leaders
after taking a 6-5 lead at the
17:47 mark of the first half.

Colabrese, a 5’9” forward,
did most of her damage from

minute stretch during the
first half, Colabrese almost
single-handedly pulled Pitt
away from its Russian visi-
tors. _

With Pitt leading 23-21 at
the 7:24 mark, Colabrese hit
a jumper from just a hair
inside the three-point line,

it was the Jill Colabrese
show. Colabrese followed a

jumper and a coast-to—coast
driving lay-up for a total of
12 points in that span.

After the Colabrese lay-up

at the 3:13 mark, Pitt led 37-
26 and went on to take a 42-
31 lead into the second h’alf.
' The Moscow Dynamo
never seemed to recover
from the spurt and, in fact,
didn’t crawl to within eight
points of Pitt at any other
time in the game.

Huemrich assembled an _
outburst of her own in the
second half. In a three-
minute and-nine-second
period, Huemrich tallied
eight straight Lady Panther
points as Pitt struggled to
maintain a double-digit lead.

Colabrese and Huemrich,
however, were not the only
Lady Panthers ready to play
yesterday.

Joyce scored 12 points
and from her. guard position
led the team. with seven
rebounds.

Rookie center Melissa
Thompson contributed 14
points and six boards in her
collegiate debut.

“That’s a great game for a
freshman in her first ball
game,” Bruce said. “Besides
some opening game jitters,
eveiybody played well.”

.“We’re very happy with
the performance,” Colabrese
said. “Everyone came out
aggressive with high intensi-

ry.”

Big East
Continued from page 6
Villanova, but won another 3-0

sweep. I

Braziel said an aggressive atti-
tudeon the part of the players
was a key to the team’s play on
the first day of the tournament.

“We put the girls on the offen-
sive,”.Braziel said. “Let’s take it
to them and thank you — good-
bye. We do well when we have
that attitude."

For two games on Sunday,
the Panthers were not even
‘close.

“We thought they would

Ci come out on fire and they did,”

Braziel said.

Braziel‘ called for a time-out to
stop the stumbling, and it
worked temporarily, as Pitt
pulled back to a 5-4 deficit on a

kill by Carrie Thornton. The ’

Panthers got no closer, coming
up short on a late run as the

Pirates took game one 15-9.

Braziel said later that she
never thought Pitt would lose
the second game, but they did.
The story was similar to game
one, with a close score early
and Seton Hall slowly pulling
away to a 15-9 win.

“We:_‘_p}/ere pretty confident,”
setter Annie Mernagh said. “We
knew all we had to do was pass
the ball. In game three  all the
pressure was on them.”

Pitt added to that pressure by
dominating the third game. The
Panther lead was 14-2 before
the Pirates got a point on a kill,
a" line drive by Zake..That only
delayed a 15-5 win, which
Lucanie sealed with an ace.

“They may have made a cou-
ple of mental errors and we got
sharper,” Braziel said. “[Lucaniel
got better and better. It was a
total shift.”

II-'-‘STUDENT

GVERNMENT

Pitt won game four, 15-8 and
a fifth game for the champi-
onship. .
Lucanie, who was name
tournament Most Valuable
Player for the fourth time, took
charge in the third game, with
11 of her 22 kills for the match.
“That’s why she’s the player
of the year in the Big East three
years in a row,” Braziel said.
The fifth game was played

using rally scoring in which _

eithe_r team can score on each
play. Pitt made onlytwo mis-
takes, two ball-handling errors,
while the Pirates had two ser-
vice errors, a ball handling
error, a net violation and three
hitting errors in the game.

Seton Hall was as close as 12-
9 late, but Pitt slammed home
the last three points, with
Lucanie’s 22nd kill sealing the
victory.
