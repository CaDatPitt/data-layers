has set out to abolish the only so-
cial rule still in effect in the resi-
dence halls-—the curfew for fresh-

WHB. under the leadership of
Jan Miller. president. has asked
the University Social Commission
to review the possibilities of ex-
tending the No-Curfew System to
freshman woman.

The Social Commission. headed
by Dr. Charles Montgomery. dean
of Student Development. will re-
view the suggestion at a hearing
Monday at 4 p.m. in the Student
Union.

The committee will make a rec-
ommendation to Bernard Ko-
bosky, Vice Chancellor of Student
Affairs, who will make the final
decision.

Presently. freshman women are
allowed to participate in the Self-
Regulatory Curfew System
(SRCS). which is. in effect. a no-
curfew system with parental per-
mission. SRCS also requires the
women to sign out ifgthey expect
to be out past maximum curfew.

SA Recalls Pitt News

Money Over Salaries

by BILL GORMLEY
At the recommendation of
the Allocations Committee.
the Student Government So-

cial Commission voted 7-1-1 to
recall $4.220 previously allo-
cated to the Pitt News for op-
erating expenses.

Diane Klavonic. Arnie Stein-
berg. Wade Lawson, Lee Elder,
Linda Milovats, Ted Michalik
and Larry Shaffer voted yes.
Lee Clabots voted no. Dennis
Concilla abstained.

Chairman’ of the Commission
Lenny Klavonic can vote only in
case of a tie. *

“What we‘re really voting on."
Lenny Klavonic. the Social Com-
missioner said, prior to the tal-
ly. “is who is Student Govern-
ment: the Pitt News or Student
Government."

Program Commissioner Con-
cilla posed the question: “Do we
feel ideologically that people in

day and 2:30 a.m. Friday and Sat-
urday. The women must also sign
in when they return to the dorms.

An ad-hoc committee of three
freshman women. Joann Katz.
Phyllis Lake and Mary Ellen
Pohl. and sophomore Lynn Zim-
merman. proposed No-Curfew
System for freshman women.

The regulations would no longer
require parental permission for
eligibility and would make sign-
out voluntary.

Miller explained the rationale
behind their request.

“All we ask is that they be
treated equally with freshman
men who have never had a cur-
few." she said.

Miller pointed out that there has
been an “implicit referendum”
indicating that the freshmen want
such a privilege. One hundred per
cent of the freshman women re-
quested parental permission to
participate in the SCRS program.
Permission was granted to 93.9
per cent of them.

 In the past the main role of WHB
has been to liberalize social rules

and to alleviate problems with)

maintenance and utilities. Now

 

that the organization has attacked
the last social rule and made pro-
gress in establishing communi-
cations with housing personnel.
Miller says WHB will have to
change it role if it is to remain
useful.

Miller hopes to make WHB
more responsive to the desires of
female residents by setting up
programs. activities and recrea-
tion for them.

“We should make dorms more
than a stopping-off place for stu-
dents to use between classes and
other campus activities,” she
said.

The president has composed a
newsletter to women residents in
which she asks the residents to
“start seriously thinking" about
what activities they would like to
see in the resident halls. She men-
tioned such possibilities as
dances. speakers. movies. parties
and programs on current and rel-
evant subjects.

WHB has already started co-
sponsoring TGIF dances every
Friday afternoon with the Social
Commission. In the future it will

also be sponsoring a' hylpnotist and
a rap grou.p”on worne.n‘s liberation.

(V.

the Pitt News deserve sal-

aries?” Concilla said he “would

like to see the Pitt News re-

ceive salaries,” but expressed

“resentment” at the “methods

the Pitt News is using to attempt

to coerce the Social Commis-
sion.’’

Bill Gormley, editor-elect of
the Pitt News, argued that the sal-
ary question was not at issue.
“The Pitt News is going to pay
salaries," he asserted. "We have
that right and will exercise it."

At a previous meeting, Gorm-
ley produced a letter from Vice
Chancellor for Student Affairs
Bernard Kobosky authorizing
the Pitt News to use a portion
of the administrations $16,000
allocation to the Pitt News for
“merit assistance“ payments.

Gormley told the Social Com-
mission before the vote that, if
they recalled the $4,220, the Pitt
News might be unable to pub-‘
lish during the Spring Session.
“At the minimum,” he said, “we
will be forced to curtail our
coverage of campus events.” -

When Gormley said he didn‘t
regard his posture as a
“threat." some members of the
Social Commission groaned.
Steinberg accused the Pitt News
of “starting to tear us (the So-
cial Commission) down in an ef-
fort to get salaries."

Lee Clabots. the lone dissen-
ter, charged his fellow Social
Commission members with be-
ing “totally ridiculous with
this."

Clabots, who favors a referen-
dum on Pitt News salaries, said
“we shouldn’t be appalled if
Student Government’s back is
up against the wall.”

neering students.

It’s the only parade on the Pitt
campus this year (Tuesday

down Cardiac Hill (Tuesday, 2-4
.p.m.), and a chance for non-
engineers to View Benedum Hall.

Benedum Hall is replacing En-
gineering Hall as the primary
center of engineering activities.
It has been under construction
for the past ten years and is
three years behind schedule in
planning. However, faculty and
students are now occupying its
facilities.

The week will also be a chance
for everyone to attend the Sham-
rock Ball‘. Allof the‘Pittsburgh’,

About 4,000 students have the
latest "dope" on courses since
the distribution course evaluation
booklets on Tuesday.

However, Dr. Fred Gottlieb. as-

‘ sociate professor of Biology. fears
i that the 65 page study may pre-
sent a distorted view of courses

_ ' and professors‘ teaching abilities.

The statistics include ratings
of a courses value and a teachers
merits on a 1-5 scale.

Referring to the evaluation of
Biology 35 Gottlieb fumed, “If
someone read the statistical data,
the course is a rose, but if you
read the comments I come out
smelling like a turd.”

The Biology professor is in fav-
or of evaluation and lauded its
possibilities as a method of feed-
back for instructors. But he feels
that “it does the students, the de-

partments and the school a dis-
service if the verbal comments
misrepresent the consensus of
opinion.

"After all.“ he went. on. "how
many students take the time to
read the numbers?”

Of the 229 cards returned for
Biology 35 over 50 per cent had a
positive reaction to the Genetics
course. These were reflected in
the numerical statistics, but few
appeared among the written com-
ments.

John Townsend. professor of
Physics and faculty advisor for
the Evaluation Committee. em-
phasized that the statistics are
the most important part of the
Course Evaluation Booklet. “I
can’t believe that you students
don‘t pay any attention to the
numbers above when you go
through the booklet." the profes-
sor said. -

Rudy Potenzone. one of the co-
chairman for the course Evalua-
tion Committee. explained how
the comments were written. Each
comment writer was instructed
to read all the evaluation _cards
once before reviewing ’ them.
Then he reread them and noted
the verbal opinions.

Potenzone defended his com-
mittee. “Of course, they have to
make a value judgement, but they
have to include comments repre-
sentative of the cards they read.

“As a comment writer it's im-
portant to include things like TA
(teaching assistant) discrepan-
cies and other information it
would be helpful for students to
know.“ Potenzone went on. "Af-

    

 Prof Cliargcs "illisrepresentation"

ter all v.'c"re not playing a game
and theres no reason why we ever
had to return the cards to the pro-
tessors."

Potenzone pointed out that if
students read the introduction and
used the booklet as intended it
could be an aid for students decid-
ing on courses.

“Statistics are the evaluation
and what you want to know." Po-
tenzone emphasized. "The verbal

~ comments can help the students

in their decisions — but really
they‘re just the whipped cream."

THE Mentor Program, design-
ed to make freshmen a part of
the University, is looking for
prospective Mentors.

Students who are chosen for
the program will participate
in a training session at the
University's Johnstown campus
April 17-20.

Interviews for the selection
of candidates for the 1971-72
Mentor Program have been
underway for three weeks.
Interviews are available every
day at ll a.m. and 2 p.m. in
room 508, SU, until Wednes-
day, March l7.

Those individuals interested
in the program may fill out an
application at the time of in-
terview. Those who have ap-
plied but have not been con-
tacted can come for their in-
terviews at the above times
and place. i

Registration Begins

The »\rlvi-trig) Center l::l‘d¥T_‘Zl(}Ll.\‘
to reduce strain on students who
will begin the tedious process--of
registration next. Tuesday.

Letters explaining the proce-
dure ol declaring a major. have
been sent to those students who
have earned over 55 credits. Pros-
pective juniors should have made
appointments to register by call-
ing their major departments.

Students who have not received
this information or who have
questions concerning the selec-
tion of a major advisor should
contact the Advising Center on the
ninth floor of the Cathedral.

Freshmen and sophomores who
missed their group meetings are
reminded to contact the Advising
Center and make plans for fall
registration.

Fred Koloc, director of the Ad-
vising Center, emphasized that
only about one-tenth of the stu-
dents confer with their advisors
when registration is not in pro-
cess. He pointed out that the ad-
visors are anxious and available
to discuss courses and academic
problems anytime.

If a student wishes to change his
advisor he may initiate the pro-
cess by contacting either Fred Ko-
loc. Dave Lueddee. or Connie Car-
roll at ext. 296.

In an attempt to save the stu-
dent time. an advisors signature
will no longer be required on
drop-add slips. But Koloc stressed
that the Advising Center "is anxi-
ous to discuss changes with stu-
dents. especially if they concern
the students major field.

A reminder sheet to inform

students of scholarship changes
and part-time status that may re-

sult when drop-add is used will be
published and made available to
students at registration.

Because the Advising (‘enter is
anxious to hear student sugges-
tions on their operations. Fresh-
man Council is heading an eval-
uation of the center. Students are
urged to participate.

Publicity Chairman

The Student Association (SA)
recently announced the appoint-
ment of Albert Wynn. a sopho-
more Political Science major to
the chairmanship of the newly
created SA Public and Commun-
ity Relations Committee.

He is also a member of Kappa
Alpha Psi and the William Pitt De-
bate team.

Primarily, the seven or possi-
bly eight member committee is
responsible for keeping the stu-
dent body informed of all SA ac-
tivities, to develop communica-
tions between SA and the news
media and to alleviate the “nega-
tive image” that Pitt students
have of the surrounding commun-
ity.

A spokesman for SA felt that

-the students and community did

not have any real rapport and that
a series of programs involving
students and the community
would be established to provide
the “badly needed communica-
tions between the two groups.

Advisory Committee Formed

Students Aid Security

Various student interests on
campus will gain a voice in Uni-
versity security policies when the
newly—formed Campus Security
Advisory Committee convenes for
the first time next week.

Dennis Concilla. Program Com-
missioner. is calling for one rep-
resentative from each of several
student groups. including the

Commuter Association. the Black

Action Society, men and women‘s
on and off-campus housing organ-
izations. Student Association. the
Residence Assistance staff and
others.

Administrators involved are
Bernard Kobosky. Vice Chancel-
lor for Student Affairs: Robert
Merritt. superintendent of Cam-
pus Police; and John Vrana. di-
rector of Housing.

“The purpose of the commit-

tee is to increase communication
between Campus Security and
students,” Concilla explained.

According to Merritt. who will
function as the administrator in
charge of the committee. a group
of students and University offi-
cials met to discuss security
problems after the incident in the
Towers lobby two weeks ago.

It was ;\/lerritt's suggestion at
that time to create a "Se-curi.t_v
Committee in order to discon-
tinue these ad hoc meetings where
people complain but. unlike ad-
ministrators. do not have to ac-
cept continuing responsibility.“

The proposal to form the com-
mittee has been made to Kobosky
by Concilla.

The committee will meet bi-
monthly.

Enthusiasm and perseverance
paid off last week for Ken Kren-
icky. the first freshman ever
elected to the presidency of the
Men‘s Dorm Council.

Krenicky overcame the obsta-
cle of being a freshman by estab-
lishing personal contact with
dorm residents in the Tower’s
Lobby while the elections were
underway.

His personable manner and sin-
cere interest in the problems of
the students apparently impress-
ed many of the residents. He re-
ceived 58 per cent of the vote.
while the other 42 per cent was

split between sophomores Terry.

Aaron and Rudy Potenzone.

Even more surprising than the
election of a freshman president
was the 25 per cent voter turnout,
a remarkable percentage for a
Student Government election.

This year Krenicky served as
chairman of the Cultural and

‘Community Relations Committee

of the MDC. which backed the Uni-
ver.sity‘s plan to build the hillside
dorm complex. Krenicky is also a
Sigma Chi pledge.

Krenicky. a resident of West
Mifflin. Plans to major in either
political science or history. His
ultimate plans include law school
and he is also interested in po-
litics.

Considering his goal as the pres-
ident of MDC, Krenicky said, “I

Recently Elected MDC President

Krenicky reported that some

Krenicky also questioned the
utilization of the Campus Bus by

pus Bus when it passes the Tow-
ers on its regular run?” he asked.

The new president also plans to
appoint a committee to research
the feasibility of bringing cable
TV to the dorms. Work is now un-
derway to create a TV lounge in
Tower C—presently the only TV
available for student use is one
located in the Student Union.

Commenting on the recent room
drawings for dorm
Krenicky said, “It seemed to be
very fair; the system for qssign-
ing rooms was brought out into
the open.

Krenicky also hopes to influ-
ence the administration to adopt
a definite policy on drugs which
will protect innocent students.

He added that he would work
for more coed dorms if the admin-
istration is satisfied with the ex-
periment presently underway in
McCormicek Hall and if enough
students are interested.

Krenicky enthusiastically indi-
cated his willingness to make the
MDC a powerful representative
of student opinion. but added that
the council can only function if

the students are willing to air‘

their grievances to the members
of the organization.

Baring the penchant for poor reason-

ing which has become his trademark.
7‘-‘Soci’al Commissioner Lenny Klavonic pre-
-, tended to understand the matter at hand.
'f,"»“The question before us tonight,“ he
told‘ the Social Commission Tuesday
. night‘, “is: should The Pitt News receive
' ‘ salaries?"
‘Would someone please inform Mr.
.Klavonic (try bellowing at him a few
‘times because polite discourse won't
. work), that that was not the qeustion at
e - all?

At issue was whether the Social
Commission should accept the Alloca-
tions Committee’s recommendation that
$4,220 previously allocated for The Pitt
— .News operating expenses be frozen.

 The Pitt News indicated repeatedly
7 . before the vote that salaries will be paid
0‘ --to_staff members so long as The Pitt
.. News continues to publish during the
2 current fiscalyear.

' That is our prerogative, because the
' $16,000 which the administration allocat-
ed to The Pitt News can be used for
’_.salary payments as well as operating
expenses.

In a letter dated March 4, Vice
Chancellor for Student Affairs Bernard
Kobosky indicated the “the University's
contribution for subscriptions was intend-
ed to place The Pitt News on a stable
financial base, and to provide for the

/

payment of merit assistance to staff
members.”

Because we believe it is right. we
will continue to compensate The Pitt
News members until our money runs
out. We will not be intimidated by a
group which does not have the right to
decide on the salary issue at this time.

When the Social Commission voted
<2’-1-ll to recall $4.220 of the Pitt News’
funds. it knew that the consequence
may be that The Pitt News will not pub-
lish during the Spring Session this
year.

If that proves necessary, the Social
Commission must bear the responsibility
for the services of which students will be
deprived.

vonic pontificated Tuesday. "is who is
the Student Government: Student Govern-
ment or The Pitt News.“

For Klavonic. the vote was a way of
asserting the Social Commissions auth-
oritv.

For "others. it somehow represented

a moral witness on the question of The
Pitt News salaries.

Unfortunately for students. the Social
Commission ignored the key question
at stake: will The Pitt News have the
funds to operate during the Spring
Session?

The Social Commission has flexed
its muscles. and we are duly awed. But
in the process, it has made it likely
that students at this University will be
deprived of a newspaper this spring.

And it has tried totrample on the
autonomy of The Pitt News .

Unless the student body lets the
Social Commission know that it will not
condone the venomous bickering which is
now rife. it will continue. and the petty
politicians will have their way.

The Pitt News deplores the myopia
of the Social Commission and serves
notice that it will not kowtow before it
in an effort to obtain funds.

We can stand being barked at. But
when are the students at the University
going to chain the dog‘?

cently been awarded the Scholarships for Summer Study Abroad, are
» making plans to leave for‘Europe. _

The program, existing since 1948, has awarded approximately
, l_60 awards over the years. The scholarships are a result of the ef-
~ forts made by the Nationality Rooms Committees.

tion at Pitt, a QPA of 2.75, and completion of studies at the University.

I Students interested were asked to complete an eight page applica-
/tion. Pre-selection was based on the applications. All finalists then had
personal interviews. 0

Final selectionswere made by panels consisting of three mem-
bers of the Nationality Room Committees, two faculty members and
- one person from the Cultural and Educational Exchange Committees.

Image, Philosophy

by JOE BANISZENSKIF
The Owl will have a new look

-this year.

Prevailing the 1971 edition of
the Owl, Editor Chip Berger de-
scribed numerous changes de-
signed ,to make the yearbook
more appealing to all students.

Berger emphasized that the
staff has a different “philosophy
of a yearbook“ and characterized
the 1971 Owl as a book designed
not to win contests but to be an
“historians document" that fac-
tually describes the University.

The theme of this year’s Owl——
a one-volume, hardback book, will
reflect how Pitt has changed‘ in
the past four or five years. With
the graphic displays that have
characterized the last two edi-
tions deeemphasized, Berger said
that the 1971 book will take “a
more intellectual approach” in
identifying the character of the
University.

Berger expressed the hope that
this change of image for the year-
book will attract more readers
who desire an accurate record of
the years events.

The major issues confronting
the University which the staff has
investigated are University ex-
pansion into the neighboring com-
munities and the off-campus hous-
ing’ situation. These areas will be
given extensive coverage.

‘CONCERT

A concert of music and dance
will be held at 8:30 p.m. Fri-
day, March I2, in room I20/
‘I21 David Lawrence Hall. The
program will feature the Uni-
versity’s Jazz Ensemble and
Orchesis and is sponsored by
the Fine Arts Committee of
Pitt's Women’s Association.

TOUR

The Pitt Chapter of GASP
will sponsor a tour of pollution
land March I3. The tour will
begin at 9 a.m. Saturday from
the Fifth Ave. side of the SU.
Members of Allegheny County
Pollution Control Bureau will
serve as guides through the
U.S. Steel's Edgar Thomson
Plan, Clairton Coke Works;
Jdnes and laughlin, and a Du-
quesne Light power station.
Reservations may be made at
the SU ticket office for a fee of

25¢.

   

In addition, campus political
attitudes and University politics
and government will receive par-'
ticular attention. Another section
of the yearbook will investigate
the presence of drugs on campus
and the subsequent impact of nar-
cotics agents and theenforcement
of drug laws.

Representatives from the“”place-
ment office were contacted to de-
fine the state of the current job
market for college. graduates.

To gather the most accurate

representationyof the feelings of

various campus groups, a number
of sections in the Owl will be~writ-
ten by individuals closely‘ identi-
fied with those groups.

The "section dealing with black

V students on campus will be writ-

ten by Gahmial Ballard of the
Black Action Society. Virginia
Joyce will write on women and
the University.

The report on Pitt's financial
position as a state-related univer-
sity will be handled by Scott
Baum. former Student Govern-
ment president. The president of
the Commuter Association, Tom
Gainan, will discuss the role of

the Universitys commuter popu-,

lation.

Revisions in curriculum are
to be reported by Ellen Wartella
of the Arts and Sciences Review
Committee.

In addition, the Owl staff has
planned a section dealing with the

attitudes of campus security po-

lice. Officers of the security force
will be asked about their feelings
on student protest, their roles in
relation to students and the na-
ture of their duties to the sur-
rounding urban community.

By concentrating on these re-
search projects, Berger said he
feels the Owl will attract more
readers. because the students will
receiving a book that accurately
portrays the unique qualities of
the University.

Some of the funds usually spent
on graphic effects have been
channeled into these research pro-
jects. It is this departure from
past style. Berger stated, that has
had a marked influence upon the
Owl staff. The present staff is one
of the largest in recent years and
has shown, in the editors words,
“a real team effort."

Probaby the most obvious ex-
ample of the staff’s spirit was in
reviving the Owl’s financial stat-
us. Upon becoming editor, Ber-
ger stated that he found the year-
book to be operating in debt. The
problem was further compound-
ed when the Owl received less

than half of its requested alloca-

tion.

However, by staff efforts to
bring in more patrons and sub-
scribers, in addition to cutting
extravagances, Berger
that the Owl’s debt will be com-
pletely eliminated by next year.

Berger went on to say that in
terms of bothsfinances and mor-
ale, the staff has made an ex-
ceptional come-back. Calling pre-
vious yearbooks artistic works
intended for contests, Berger said
the staff morale suffered be-
cause the Owl became the work of
only a few individuals.

Berger maintained that the staff
morale has improved with the
change in the philosophy of the

Owl. “The staff was determined,

to make a historykof the year and
as a result the book is not the ef-
fort of a few individuals but is a
team effort because everyone is
involved.” ‘

Berger emphasized that the
1971 book will contain little edi-
torializing and that all editorials
will be marked as such. The edi-
tor also stated that the 1971 year-
book will not be entered in any
contests, to further remind the
staff that their purpose is to pre-
sent for all students an accurate
history of the University in 1971.

Revisited

Space limitations resulted in
some unforseen deletions in my
review on the current University
Theater production. Unfortun-
ately. some major contributors
to the show were left out. They
are now commented upon as ap-
pearing in the original review.

Costumes: Lynn R. Heming-
way has created costumes which
are as beautiful as they are
matched to the period of the play.
Each is a colorful construction.
Whether simple or ornate. Their
design shows much thought and
imagination.

Set Design: Henry Heymann
has created a fine construction.
His rich and functional design

serves as-a perfect back-drop. His
use of well planned levels is ex-
tremely effective in creating a
setting that yields itself to crea-

tive staging.

Light Design: ‘To the far right
or far left, Richard Evans’ design
is a bit too dim for comfort. If,
however, one looks center and up-
stage, his use of the media can be
rewarding.

Music: Original music for this
production was created by David
Spangler. Mr. Spangler has com-
posedga score that is as matched
to the mood and movement of the
show as it is memorable. His
work-—as a composer and musi-
cian——is deserving of much praise.

Actors: As members of “the
players" . . . Bill Keyes, Frank
Serrao and Bill Rockwell were a
delight to both see and hear. Len
Feldman, as Egeus, delivered a
fine portrayal in a minor role.

 
     
      
   
   
   
         
     
     
 

UNFORTUNATELY portions of
Chuck Levine's recent review
of experimental theatre at the

tween his writing and the time 
lit took to reach the printer.

Dr. Kenneth Regenbaum (au-

and he earned the admiration of
about 100 Pitt students when he
demonstrated his trade in the
Towers lobby Monday evening.

Cercone is a virtuoso in his
field. His fellow barbers and hair
stylists in recent years named
him Barber of the Year and Inter-
national Hair Stylist of the Year.
His articles appear frequently in
trade journals and he is in great
demand as a lecturer and teacher.

Cercone views himself as more
than a barber or hair stylists.
‘fI‘m atop performer,” he said
following his demonstration,"
we're all performers. If I don't
have a crowd around, I can't per-
form." ‘

Before the crowd in the Towers .
lobby, Cercone played his part to
the hilt. Dressed in a green and
gold irridescent tuxedo with a
ruffled shirt, Cercone shaped the
hair of volunteers while explain-

elegant glow far removed from
the musty barber show with strip-
ed pole and stale magazines.

In his more than 35 years in the
business, Cercone has barbered
many celebrities. Among them
are Jack Benny. Liberace, and
Spiro Agnew. Cercone styled Ag-
new’s hair when the latter was
governor of Maryland. “His side-
burns were too thin," recalls Cer-
cone.

Though confident of his ability,
Cercone will not dictate styles» to
his customers. “I like to give peo-

handle. I say to myself, ‘Howcan
I improve it.” '-

Cercone recently invented and
patented a device he calls the
“Concavex Twin Styling Shears.”
These shears which are used for
feathering, blending; waving and
thinning,-are said to be a major
improvement on all other models,
in that they leave no tell-tale trace
of cuts. 1

Cercone is sometimes a little
more innovative than his clients
would like. Though the use of hair
spray and hair nets for men is
becoming commonplace, Cercone

look is more than-a fad. “Long

he said. “I don't think that its go-
ing to stay at shoulder length.

Cercone, a native Pittsburgher,
offers these tips for hair care:

I more frequently;
——If you hair is too dry, don't wash
it quite so much;
—If you‘ve got split ends, your

As last year’s indoor track
season concluded, ' Jim Banners
track squad finished as the
eighth best track team in the
country because of their fine
performance. This year, the
tracksters are a “sure bet" to
at least remain there and pos-
sibly move up in the standings.

Tonight, in Detroit, the track‘
"team

sends a contingent of
nine athletes to participate in
seven events and attempt to at
least maintain its status quo.

The second-best team in the
East shouldn’t have to try hard

 to find inspiration to emotion-

of the runners have been wait-

  A Movie
  Review

by ED CONLEY
Sports Editor

I’ve always envied the movie reviewer. His job seems so
easy. He goes into a theater, enjoys or hates a movie, and then
tells his readers about his thoughts during the presentation.
What a snap! -

So when .I heard that the sports publicity office was go-
ing to give students an opportunity to view its “first ever"
football publicity film, I decided I would become a movie
reviewer.

Never again.

I found myself writing down just about everything I
saw-during the half hour “flick” in fear that I would forget
something worthwhile. Eight pages of notes on a half hour
film—-I never have that many notes from an hour long inter-
view. 1

However. writing so much didn‘t affect my enjoyment
of the film which was titled “The Panther Is Back“. It was
a pleasure to see the 1970 Pitt football season in review.
Reliving that wild 36-35 Panther triumph over West Virginia
made the movie worth going to see.

Naturally that thrilling win was the highlight of “The
Panther Is Back,“ and the presentation was, carried through

*  beautifully. While the final series of plays were being run,

the live radio broadcast by WTAE’s Ed Conway described
the action. Bill Pilconis‘ touchdown grab for point number
36 seemed like it was happening all over again.

In fact, Pilconis’ grab happened three times .during
the film at the end on the section on the Pitt-WVU game as
well as at the beginning and end of the film.

The TelRa production was honest enough, including

glimpses of the’ five Pitt losses, but narrator Ray Scott’s
conclusion after the WVU game that ‘The Panther was back’

-was a little hard to take, knowing the Cats proceeded to

lose four consecutive games at the season’s end.

Scott, who is THE professional sportscaster, was at his
usual best. There was one line he had to deliver, though, that
didn't come off well. Between halves of the West Virginia
game with Pitt down, 35-8, the camera focused on Chancellor
Wesley Posvar, and Scott read his lines:

“Chancellor Wesley Posvar is Pitt’s top sports fan. He
looks for the second half to be different—the Chancellor was
right!” i I

Could the Chancellor have been that nieve at halftime?
That one line. is the only thing about the film that bother-

‘ ed me. The color was great—although I‘m told the version

shown wasn‘t the best—-and Pitt Stadium never looked better.
Even Syracuse’s Archbold Stadium appeared more comfortable
in the footage than it seemed that dreary day in upper New
York when the Panther fortunes began to collapse.

Any group desiring an opportunity to view ‘The Panther
Is Back’ can do so for a $5 rental fee by contacting the
Field House publicity office. Though I'm really not a movie
reviewer, I think it’s a decent half hour’s entertainment for
the Pitt football fan.

It lookslike Dick Bradshaw will stay on as Pitt's head
swimming coach‘.

The women hoopsters slid
past Slippery Rock State Col-
lege, 44-42, in their last game
of the season Wednesday night.

Although there was little
scoring, it was a rough contest
with the lead see-sawing back
and forth.

Pitt starters — co-captains
Phyllis Wojciechowski and Elaine
Kingas, Rose Smith, Cathy ﬁas-
sell and Tana Casciola——took an
early lead, and by the end of
the first quarter led, 10-7. Slip-
pery Rock came back, however’,
and led at the half, 19-15.

The 5 second half saw an in-
crease in the heated action.
Kingas continued to shoot and
hit, and with minutes left in
the fourth quarter, Wojcie-
chowski and substitute Jan
Klause connected for key
points as the Pitt cagers went
ahead, 28-27.

The fourth quarter proved to
be the toughest of. all. Pitt
slipped to five points behind in
the early part of the quarter.
But Wojciechowski, who had
been shooting and missing
from the outside earlier in the
contest, started to connect. Her
accuracy. combined with the
stable shooting of Kingas and
the defensive play of the hoop-
sters, helped to contain Slippery

“While the Easterns are a team thing, the District 2 meetlis

“No team trophies will be awarded, but I would guess Navy

Three years ago, Coach Carl
DePasqua was limited in his ma-
nuverability at the quarterback
position. He relied on transfer
student Jim Friedl for the entire
season and called on reserves
Frank Gustine and Chuck Winters
only sparingly.

' Lastjseason, the head Panther
grid coachfound it necessary to
use all three of his signal callers
to guide the squad. This spring,
DePasqua has the opportunity to
get a good look at four QBs who
are battling for the top spot be-
fore the spring game.

Dave Havern, veteran of two
previous grid campaigns, is the
senior partner of the quartet.
John Hogan. who started several

times last year as a sophomore.
is the other experienced hopeful
of the group.

The two newcomers to the var-
sity quarterback race are Bob
Medwid and Rod Huth, both pre-
sently freshmen. Last fall, the
two split the time at the quarter-
back slot for the Cubs as Medwid
started twice and Huth once.

Because of the already over-
crowded situation at this posi-
tion, DePasqua had decided to
switch Tom Hasbach, Bob Veil-
lette and Dan Rullo to the defen-
sive backfield. Hasbach saw lim-
ited action on the varsity last sea-
son, while both Veillette and Rul-
lo played for the Cubs last fall.

All four candidates agree that
they work just a little bit harder

and Rod Huth (21) drill during the opening day of

spring football practices. Both are sophomores and will be competing with
Dave Havern and John Hogan for the starting quarterback spot in the fall.

knowing that three others are
ready to step in. Hogan stated
that "competition is good-it's
what the game of football is all
about. It brings out the best in
you.”

The sentiments of the four are
divided in half with respect to
their present desires. Medwid and
Huth seem concerned with learn-

ing to adjust to the varsity,

whereas the other two are con-
centrating on correcting past mis-
takes.

“It’s hard to see so soon where
I stand,” said Huth. “It’s all sort
of confusing at times and I’m
learning a lot.”

Medwid echoed Huthsfeelings
by saying, “Right now I’m getting
oriented to the system. I get more
attention than last year." '

Havern, who has started 17 of
the 19 games that he has played at
Pitt, compared the upcoming sea-
son and the quarterback race with
years past.

“Every year you have to do bet-
ter because somebody is coming
up to take your spot," he said.
“When I was a sophomore there
were six of us trying out.”

This season, DePasqua hopes to
implement a varied offense into
the Panther attack. Havern wants
to run the ball more under the
planned split offense.

Hogan, who set a Pitt single
game record for passes com-
pleted and yards gained in the
opener against UCLA last fall, is
also anticipating the new offense;

"We‘re experimenting with the
triple option and I’ll have to work
on my pitching and my running."
he commented. “Last year was-
n‘t that good or bad--1 just hope
I can stay healthy this year. "

In the opening days of the spring
drills, DePasqua and ‘backfield
coach Bimbo Cecconi have the
four signalcallers working on bas-

Grid Coach

Carl DePasqua has named
Ralph Jelic. a former Panther. to
fill the vacancy created when Torn
Fletcher quit the coaching staff
last week to join the Bay State
Patriots.

Jelic, a former South Hills High
stand-out, played one season at

Dayton University before trans-i

fering to Pitt in 1955. While here
he was a right- halfback-fullback
on Pitt's Sugar Bowl and Gator
Bowl teams in '55 and ’56. He later
went on to tryout with the Steelers
but failed to make the squad.

Jelic‘s coaching career began‘

at Lehigh in 1961 where he was an
assistant. He moved to Boston
University in 1964 and finally to
Harvard in 1968. With the retire-
ment of John Yovicsin he was a
candidate for the head coaching
job but he decided to come to Pitt.

* * *

As voted by the 21 returning let-
termen, John Simpson and Jack
Dykes will be the Panthers‘ per-
manent co-captains. This is the
first time in nine years that the
Cats will have players so desig-
nated.

Ironically enough.
Dykes nor Simpson were on hand
for the opening of the Panther
spring drills on Tuesday. Dykes,
a 6-1, 235 .pound tackle from
Apollo (Kiski Area) is still nurs-
ing a knee ligament tear. Simp-
son, also 6-1. is a 244 pound
guard from Zanesville. Ohio. He
will miss spring drills because of
the conflict with the baseball
team for which he also plays.

* * >l<

Coach DePasqua has lined up
two more recruits for the 1971-
72 freshmen squad. They are
Dave Janasek and Jeff Cranston.
Janasek. a 6-2, 200 pound full-
back-defensive back from Gil-
mour Academy. and Cranston, a
6-3. 210-pound tight end from
Niles McKinley High, are both
football stars from Ohio.

Skaters At Home,

The Pitt Hockey Club. 2-1-1,
will take on a Johnstown semi-pro
team this Sunday. The game is at
the Alpine Ice Chalet at 7:15 p.m.
Admission is 506; for students and
$1 for non-students. The game
will be the last home game until
April 2 when the icers close their

Because of. the uncompromis-
ing late winter weather. bats have
been cracking and balls have been
flying in the Field House and in
Trees Hall. Yes. despite the
weatherman. spring is on its way
and with it Coach Bobby Lewis
and his Pitt baseball team.

Baseball practice began March
1 and. although it has been con-
fined indoors. things seem to be
coming along as scheduled.

“The boys are getting in shape
——running for conditioning and
throwing to get their arms in
shape." related Lewis.

Lewis is having problems other
than the weather. With the grad-
uation of starters Cliff Brown,
Ron Howie, Frank Gustine and
Ron O’Grodnik, he is left without
an experienced infield.

"We need to built a whole new
infield.“ said Lewis. "We had a

year we need more fire power.
more hitting «last season first
baseman Frank Gustine was the
only infielder to bat above .300 I.

To help eleviate this dilemma.
outfielder Terry Stokes will move
to shortstop. In the ‘T0 campaign.
Stokes played centerfield and had
a season batting average of .333.

Lewis is also thinking of reposi-
tioning leftfielder Ken Macha.
Macha may fill the vacancy at
either first or third base.

“Macha is a very versatile play-
er.“ stated the coach. “Last sea-
son he played in the infield on sev-
eral occasions."

With Stokes and possibly Macha
moving to the infield. Lewis has
eight players to choose from to
fill the void in the outfield.

Lewis has no one in particular
in mind to replace Cliff Brown at
second. “It’s going to be a cram-
ble for second base,” he said.

Even with the loss of ace pitch- V

er George Medich. Pitt's coach is
not anticipating any great prob-
lems in the pitching department.

"It‘s difficult to lose‘ someone
of the caliber of George and not
be hurting. But we have others to
pick up the slack."

Lewis has scheduled 35 games
for this spring. Therefore, he
will carry 8-10 pitchers on the
squad.

“In our schedule there are
sometimes six games in one
week." explained Lewis. "This

means we‘ll need plenty of pitch-
ing—we cant depend on games
being rained out and there's al-
ways a possibility of someone get-
ting hurt.

Lewis is still looking for an
equipment manager for his base-
ball team this season. _

that we have one." he says.
