The sole independent candidate who
won a seat on the 2014 Student Govern-
ment Board has stepped down after less
than two months in office.

The Student Government Board an-
nouncedin a public_statement Thursday
thatjake Radziwon, a junior. marketing
major, resigned from his position as
Board member.

Radziwon, who is also captain of the

Pitt men’s rugby team, was one of two
independent candidates who ran with-T

election. ’ »
Radziwon said he thinks resigning
from the Board will allow him to focus

  Students join, forces, establish streetwear brand

Joelle Smith
Staff Wrz'ter

Peter Sorek’s secret to juggling schoolwork
and launching his own company is simple.
He makesto-do lists. '

Sorek, a junior studying human resourc;
es management and marketing, fused his
artistic talents and business background
to launch his streetwear brand, VRNAQLR.

“It is a tough balance.  I make to-do
lists every day, and once I get my homework
done, I start my to-do list for my company,”
Sorek said. -

So far, his organizational skills are pay-
ing off. VRNAQLR has been sold at Daily

Bread and Timebomb, two streetwear con- .

signment shops in Pittsburgh, since last
summer.

The brand features a number of T—shirts '

emblazoned with the signature sketch of a

skull —— VRNAQLR’s logo. -

Sorek launched the brand two years ag

after his parents made a small investment '

in his project.

“Since T—shirts have such a low barrier
of entry, it was a good place to start,” Sorek
said. I . A

At first, Sorek admits he and his friends

A, “were just winging it.”

Jack Morrin; a friend of Sorekis and a
junior studying marketing, joined the brand

. when it originated two years ago. Morrin

met Sorek through a mutual friend during
their freshman year.

Since, Morrin has worked for the com-
pany in multiple capacities, as many co-
founders of startupsare required to do. ’

“Pete and I operate together. Originally,
we were both physically doing the design
process, but Pete has since shifted to be the
main ‘creator’,” Morrin said. “Our whole
team plays a part in all areas for the most
part.” . _ .

Currently, Morrin is assisting with the
conceptualization of designs, as well as
researching manufacturing companies
and sourcing options for the expanding
business. '

“We’ve put a lot of hard work into it so
far. It seems to have gotten the attention of

some of the right people  who believe that -

we can keep growing,” Morrin said.
Sorek’s startup costs ‘included printing

six T—shirt designs for $1,320 and establish-

ing an online store, which costs the business

$10 a month for the domain name and host’
‘for the website, as well as payment process-

ingfees. . _ _ ‘
VRNAQLR’s visually dominated web-

site is directed toward a young adult de—
mographic, featuringil‘-shirts that display a
variety of graphic artistry. The T—shirt prints
incorporate everything from photography
td cartoons. ‘ ‘

Alex Avakian, co—owner of Daily Bread,

is pleased with his customers’ response to i .

the VRNAQLR brand.
Avakian forecasts that it may take a few

‘ more years for the brand to have a recog~

nizable label. g
“They’re doing good stuff, they just need
to develop a culture around it,” Avaki-an said.
Billy Hoyle, manager of Timebomb,
agrees that starting a streetwear brand is
difficult, especially in today’s industry.

“It’s difficult to start anything from

scratch, but I would say streetwear clothing

brand is up there with some of the hardest,”

Hoyle said. . _ .
Hoyle also agrees that, so far, the VR-

NAQLR brand has sold successfully. Hoyle ’
believes the brand has brought a new ﬂavor

to the store since last summer. K I
' “Their ﬁrst line, they had a few tank
tops,” Hoyle said. “From what I remember,

one was a picture and the other two were '

screen-printed paintings. One was a candle

burning at both ends.  The burning wick .

at both ends was pretty cool to me.  It was

’ somethingl hadn’t really seen in our stores.”

According to Hoyle, the brand has con-
tinued to turn out innovative techniques in
streetwear design. He described their latest
line as “ahead of the curve.” The T—shirts
featured minimal detailing on‘ the front and
large designs on the back, the newest trend
in streetwear. _

VRNAQLR was the ﬁrst company to
bring that sort of design to Timebomb,

Sorek’s vision for the company begins
with fostering a culture. *

“We primarily see ourselves as pop cul-
ture observers, and we want to just take

in everything around us and condense it_

and put it onto clothing thatfreﬂects our

lifestyle and theolifestyles of people around

us,”,he said. ' ; ' _
Sorek added that his designs are infused

with hometown inﬂuences. As a Pittsburgh '

native, Sorek acknowledges the city has a

distinct ‘culture, but with the exception of - ’ P

Andy Warhol’s work, he believes the rest of

world may not realize Pittsburgh’s initiative.
“We just want to try to build that culture

and be ‘a part of it,” Sorek said. _ .
Avakian attests. to the’ brarrd’s artistic

, potential, “They capture the modern urban

aesthetic in a way that isn’t all skateboarder
and hip -hopped out —— not like anyone else.”

SNOWBOARD ‘

. at Hunter Mountain, N.Y., on Feb. 14 and

15, but did not qualify for nationals. Snow—.
boarders who qualiﬁed for and competed
at the regional competition automatically
advanced to nationals.

The team placed second overall in the
Allegheny Collegiate Ski Conference -
which includes Penn State, West Virginia
University and Bucknell University, among
others —— after traveling to ﬁve races, one on
each of the ﬁrst ﬁve weekends of this spring
semester. Of the team’s 30 members, there
are 12 snowboarders and 18 skiers.

Epner, the president of the team, jokingly
described the team as “a bunch of rookies”
and stressed that the Pitt Ski and Snowboard
Club focuses on having fun, as opposed to

' winning. She learned how to ski when she

was 3 years old and picked up snowboarding

“We dress up like fools every race. It’s so
fun. We don’t take it seriously. We have fun
and we still came in second,” she said.
Pitt’s Ski and Snowboard Club waslargely

‘ funded by allocations from Student Govern- 1
' "ment Board this season, but Epner said that --
'_‘next year, the club’s membership dues will
 increase. Dues this season were $250 per

team member. _

“We got a lot of allocations this year just
because they’re kind of sympathetic that I
kind of started up this team out of nowhere.
We got really lucky with the Board allocating

‘ money and I really appreciate that,” she said.

According to Nasreen Haruri, Student
Government Board Allocations Chairwom-
an, SGB has allocated $13,172.66 to the team

so far this ﬁscalyear.
The funds were used to cover dues re-

’ quired for participation in the team’s league,

competition expenses to advance it to na-
tionals, costs for practicing at Seven Springs
and equipment used to tune ski ‘and snow-
board equipment.

Harun said the Board allocated these A

funds to allow the Ski and Snowboard Club
to fulﬁll its mission. '

- “The Student Activities Fund is generated
by students, so we try to help student groups
as much as we can. SGB funded the equip-
ment because it could be used for many years
to maintain their competition_equipmen ,”

' she said in an email.

Although Pitt’s team doesn’t have schoolj
branded equipment or official coaches as
some others schools do, Heintz said this

. hasn’t held it back. In fact, theteam doesn’t

even have formal tryouts and lets anyone

Collin Casper, marketing director of
the USCSA, said in an e—mail that the most

challenging aspect for a team that’s new to
nationals will most likely bélogistics.

“I think the most challenging thing for
a new _team is not having the institutional
knowledge of how the competitions work,

how registration takes place and the impor-'

- tance of ﬁelding a full team of athletes who
have a broad set of skills for both the timed

events in snowboarding and also the judged,

events,” Casper said.

‘ At nationals in Lake Placid, N.Y., snow-
boarders will compete in slopestyle, giant
slalom and an event that Pitt’s team hasn’t
competed in before: boardercross. ’

In the boardercross event, snowboarders
race against each other down a course with
banked curves and jumps. In this competi-
tion, racers compete against otherboarders,
as opposed to aiming for thebest time.

“I think boardercross will be huge, be-
cause we haven’t done it and we haven’t
gotten to even practice it because there’s
no courses around here. We’re going to be
going_into that a little blind,” Heintz said.

In slopestyle, snowboarders use different
features on a hill such as boxes, rails. and
jumps to impress judges with challenging
tricks.

r O’Bryan, one of the six Pitt snowboarders
headed to Lake Placid, said slopestyle is her .
favorite event in which she competes because
there are better mountains in the area at
which she can practice for the event, while
competitors out West have better conditions
for racing. .

“It’s just reallyﬁin because it’s so progres— I
sive. At least at Pitt, it’s a lot easier to advance
in that,” O’Bryan, a junior economics and
political science major, said.

Heintz said that giant slalom, a race
that requires snowboarders to maneuver
around ﬂags and compete against the clock

to achieve the fastest time, is her best event.

At each competition, Epner said that Pi_tt
skiers competed in both slalom and giant
slalom. For skiers, giant slalom has gates that
are farther apart and the focus_is on speed
while" slalom requires more technical atten-
tion because the gates are closer together. ‘

“You have guards on your poles, your
arms, and your shins because you’re hitting
those gates really hard to get the least time t
on the turns,” she said. ' ‘ _

O’Bryan said competing at nationals will
be challenging because Pitt’s snowboarders
will be up against boarders who grew up on

at THE UNIVERSITY

the mountain from schools in the West, such
as Colorado University.

“I think the biggest challenge at nationals
will be competing against schools that have
a lot more training than we do,?’ she said.

Casper said that he has never been to Lake
Placid, but the winter Olympics have been
held there ‘twice before in 1932 and 1980.
The USCSA national competition venue al-
ternates between the east and west coasts
each year and the selection process begins

two or three years before the competition

takes place.

Last year at nationals, at Sun Valley Ski ‘

Resort in Idaho, the competition drew about
500 spectators. Casper said the level of at-
tendance ﬂuctuates each year depending
on location. 
Heintz said that she and her teammates

want to perform well, but they do not have.

high expectations since they have never been
to the competition before. '

“The competition level is going to be a
lot higher than we’re used to. We’ve never
been before, so we don’t really know what
to expect. I think if it’s very competitive, that
might put us off a little bit, if people are really
serious,” Heintz said. I

Nick Voutsinos
Columnist

Despite being ranked the “most

livable city” by Forbes maga-

z_ine,. there’s still_ an old,‘ familiar .

threat to residents that ‘contin-
uesto linger in the airhere in
Pittsburgh.

Air“ pollution —— which has
marred the Steel City’s history
since the days when titans of in-
dustry such as Andrew Carnegie
and Henry Clay Frick walked its
streets — persists in hindering
the quality of life here. Granted,
black smog no longer blocks the
sun or’ blankets the streets asit
did decades ago, but air pollution

‘is still considered to be one of

the city’s most perverse issue's.

According to the American —

Lung Association, Pittsburgh is
currently ranked eighth in year-
round particle pollution among
U.S. cities, and it’s the highest for

a city outside of California. The ~

consequences of this poorair
quality are made apparent in the
fact that the city ranks 17th in the
nation for its number of neigh-
borhoods containing high cancer
risks for its residents. Further-
more, the pollution has contrib-
uted to premature births and low
birth weights — as stated by the
Pittsburgh Tribune—Review —
and it has exacerbated the num-
ber of heart— and lung-disease
diagnoses in the city.‘

The main source of the toxic
airispewing into the area is the
same as when Pittsburgh was
know as the “Smoky City” in
the early 20th century. It lies
in the coal-ﬁred power plants
surrounding the city, which are

constantly sending their carci— Y

nogenic pollutants into the air.
These pollutants then travel
down and gather in the Allegh-
eny River Valley.

' As a result, Pittsburghers
are breathing in soot on a daily
basis, thus contributing to the

88,000 people in the Pittsburgh- _

New Castle area suffering from
chronic bronchitis and the
47,000 children diagnosed with
asthma.

Yet despite the apparent ur-
gency, the pollution created by
Pennsylvania’s coal industry is
allowed to continue. In part, this
is a result of the modern ameni-
ties that we depend on and take
for granted on a daily basis. No
one really thinks, too deeply
about where their electricity is
coming from when they ﬂip a
light_ switch or heat up leftovers
in themicrowave because both
are conveniences we are simply
used to at this point.

In fact, coal generates about
half of the United States’ elec-
tricity, and each day the average
person uses about 20 pounds of
coal to fuel his or her electricity
usage. As Jeff Goodell, author
of _“Big Coal,” put it, “Our shiny
white iPod economy is propped
up by dirty black rocks.”

Convenience is one reason
we continue to allow coal to
pollute our air. Another is poli-
tics. Big coal companies -—— of
which there are only four in the
nation that unearth the major-
ity of the total coal yield — are
deeply entrenched in state leg-
islatures and in Washington. In
coal—rich regions, companies
fund campaigns for local poli-

_ I health of Pittsburgh, nation  

ticians who in return provide
subsidies_and block clean-air leg-
islation, prompting politicians
such as former‘ West Virginia
Gov. Joe Manchin to proclaim
that, “There is no replacement
for coal. There might be 30 or
50 or 100 years fromnow, but
there’s not today.” By that logic,
we just have to deal with coal’s
adverse'effects, because there is
simply nothing we can do about
it, lest we give up a good chunk
of our modern way of life. .
Historically, there has been
one main talking point in de-
fense of coal used by coal ped-
dlers and the politicians who
support them: Coal is a job cre-
ator, and if you take coal away,
you are then taking jobs away
from many hard-working people.
First ofall, as a career path, a

‘ coal extraction is one of the most

treacherous. More than 104,000
Americans died mining coal be-
tween 1900 and 2005, and twice
as many have died from lung poi-
soning. The numbers continue
to pile up: Coal companies are
still seeing employee fatalities on
a monthly basis. Consequently,
the fatality rate for workers in
coal is 60 percent higher than
for those working in oil and gas
extraction.

Furthermore, according to
research conducted by econo-
mists at the University of Mas-
sachusetts’ Political Economy
and Research Institute, the coal
industry provides the third-least
amount of jobs per $1 million in-
vestment compared to all other
energy and infrastructure ﬁelds.

VOUTSINOS

For instance, in the Powder River Basin,

which stretches between Wyoming and
Montana, companies extract nearly 500
million tons of coal each year with just
7,000 workers. That’s about 66,000 tons
of coal for each worker. Moreover, the
overwhelming majority of those who
work in coal are not unionized. Real-
istically, the coal industry is not nearly

the source of jobs that some make it out
to be.

Despite this, coal is still defended
by many politicians as being economi-
cally vital. But coal is gradually losing
its power. With the EPA cracking down
on carbon emissions and with natural
gas —— which has its own set of prob-
lems —— slowly overcoming the industry,
coal’s influence has been both economi-
cally and politically lessened over recent
years. Nonetheless, coal is still very much
present and so is the pollution it creates.

' slowly weaning ourselves off the stuff, a

researcher Joel Schwartz stated, “I see

I to call people’s attention to that.” That

Even though we have made progress in '

shift in the way we use energy is required
in order to make our air fully clean again.

This needs to be done not only for
Pittsburgh’s sake, but for the sake of
the nation, as well. As public-health

‘ ‘WOMEN’S BASKETBALL V
Pitt’s late surge falls

Dan Sostek
Staff Wr2'ter .

North Carolina State’s Markeisha Gatling

- and Len’N_ique Brown didn’t let up in the

second half against Pitt. The Panthers
might hold a lowly record, but they proved
they wouldn’t go down quietly on Thurs-
day night.

If it weren’t for Brown and Gatling '——
who scored 12 and 11l'points in the second
half, respectively — the Panthers might
have completed the comeback.

Instead, the Pitt women’s basketball
team fell 79-68 to No. 13 North Carolina

State in its ﬁnal home game of the season .

at the Petersen Events Center.
The Panthers trailed by as many as

24 points before a furious comeback at— '

tempt toward the end of the game cut the
deﬁcit. In the end, though, the Panthers
were no match for the Wolfpack (24-5, 11-4
ACC) and their post game — senior center
Gatling, in particular — as _Pitt was out-
scored in the paint by a margin of 38-20.
“We knew we had our hands full with

their post players in Gatling and [Kody]

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Dixon, Pitt hope

Ryan Bertonaschi
Staff ll/rz'ter

After transitioning from the Big East to the .

ACC, Pitt coachjamie Dixon has continued
building on an impressive resumé that few
college basketball coaches can top.
Deemed Madison Square Garden’s Col-
lege Basketball “Coach of the Decade,”
Dixon left the Big East Conference as its

‘ winningest coach in history (.658), and he

holds the all-time NCAA Division I record
for most wins after eight seasons as a head
coach in 2011 (216). ,

But if there is one ghost that haunted
him during Big East play, it was Notre

Dame.

Dixon and the Panthers haVen’t seemed
to ﬁgure out a way to beat Notre Dame
(15-14, 6-10 ACC), who hosts Pitt (2117,
9-6 ACC) tomorrow at 2 p.m. 1

The last time Pitt beat Notre Dame was

' in the 2008-2009 season, and the last

time Pitt beat the Irish in the Joyce Cen-
ter was March 5, 2005, behind 26 points,
11 rebounds and four blocks from then-
sophomorecenter Chris Taft.

But this season, Notre Dame head

coach Mike Brey and ‘his team have run’

into some identity problems, as the Fight-
ing Irish have been often’ out—drawn in
ticket sales by their women’s basketball

Ito pluckithorn ‘from side at Notre; Dame

team, ranked second in the country with
a 27-0 record this season.

“We are who we are right now,” a de-
ﬂated -Brey said to reporters after Notre
Dame’s 70-49 loss at Virginia last week.

Notre Dame entered the seasonranked
No. 21 in the Associated Press poll, but

leading'scorer and ﬂoor general Jeri-an '
Grant was dismissed fromthe team in --

December because of an academic issue.
The team has struggled’ ever since. '

_ The Irish have used 11 different starting
lineups this season, including a differ-
ent starting ﬁve in each of the past three
games. They beat Georgia Tech 65-62 on
Wednesday but lost consecutive games

1 to No. 12 Virginia and Miami before that.

Brey has used a 2-3 zone at_times

-this season, and he went with the zone H

I 1 Wednesday to rattle the Yellow Jackets. ,
e Pitt, meanwhile, has somewhat struggled
7 against 2-3 zones, especially when forward
2 Lamar Patterson is on the bench.

“What helped us was we changed de-
fenses and played some zone,” Brey said

fto reporters after Wednesday’s victory,
1 his 300th win at Notre Dame. “We always
3 run a little better out of zone, and so‘we '
got some transition opportunities. It got
* them out of the rhythm they were in, and

Serio said. “But it was kind of pick your
poison tonight, because their guards
started hitting their shots, and [Gatling]
was unstoppable.” . ‘
McConnell-Serio’s description of
°Gatling was not too far from the truth, as

the 6-foot-5 center —- who has been named.

tovthe Naismith National Player of the Year
Top_ 30 list and is a strong candidate for

ACC Player of the Year _—' had 20 points _

on 8-of-11 shooting. Brown ﬁnished with
19 points on .5-of—9 shooting and made all
seven free-throw attempts, including six
Ainthe ﬁnal 90 seconds. ‘

The Panthers (11-18, 3-12 ACC) began ‘

the game holding their own and actually
held a 15-13 lead with 13:19 remaining, but
as McConnell—Serio said, they were simply’
unable to contain Gatling.

The Panthers were led by freshman ‘

February 28, 2014 I The Pitt News I wvvvx/.pittne\l/vscom.

Chelsea Welch, who posted a season—high
16 points to go along with three rebounds
and an assist off thebench. Junior guard
Brianna Kiesel had an off game offensively,
shooting 2-of—10 from the ﬁeld while tal-
lying 13 points, seven assists and six re-

bounds. Kiesel played all 40 minutes of .

the game.

Sophomore guard Brittany Gordon,
also coming off the bench, reached double
ﬁgures for the ﬁrst time this season with 12

' points. McConnell-Serio had nothing but
praise for her young guard in her postgame

press-conference.
“I am so excited for Brittany Gordon,”

‘McConnell-Serio, who has already im-

proved on Pitt’s conference and overall
record in her ﬁrst year ‘as coach, said. “I
have been calling her the ‘All-American
practice player’ ‘all year, and she was ﬁ-
nally able to transfer what she was doing
in practice to in games.”

The game marked the ﬁnal appearance

at the Petersen Events Center for the trio of

(Pitt seniors: Asia Logan, Ashlee Anderson

and Marquel Davis.

Welch, who recorded onlylher second
double-digit output of the season, said she
is sad to see them go.

“This is my ﬁrst year here,.and the se-
ni‘ors_have deﬁnitely made’ me feel‘ like
I’m home,” the freshman from Kettering,
Ohio, said. “They’ve always had my back,
and I have their back.’? ,

Although the result wasn’t what the

team wanted for its veteran leaders, Mc- '

Connell-Serio highlighted the seniors’
positive impact.
, “We talked about sending our seniors

' out on a positive note,” McConnell-Serio
added. “I don’t know if.it’s the type of way.
» they wanted their careers to end at the

Petersen Events Center, but they really set
the tone for our team this year.”

The last-place Panthers will wrap up
their inaugural season in the Atlantic Coast

Conference Sunday afternoon in south
Florida, taking on the Miami Hurricanes
in South Beach, Fla.

Despite the loss, McConnell-Serio be-

h lieves that the team will be feeling good

traveling south, particularly after the no-
table performances by the underclassmen

' Welch and Gordon.

“There’s no fear in our unc_lerclassmen,”
McConnell-Serio said. “They just go out

and they play, and they do what they’re'

capable of doing.” ﬂ _

The Irish are led in scoring by center
Garrick Sherman (13.6 points per game),
forward Pat Connaughton (13.5) and point
guard Eric Atkins (13.4), who have started
all 29 games for the Irish.

Pitt is coming off a win against ACC

Panthers shot 50 percent (23-46) on the
night, which was its best shooting contest

' in eight games, since they shot 51 percent

And now that they’re faced with a team

plays a 2-3 zone — the Panthers might
have found their rhythm just in time. II:
