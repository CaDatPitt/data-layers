Pitt may
lose tax-
exempt
status

By Lou Grieco
Associate Editor

Though city and county ofﬁcials
announced last week that they
may challenge the tax—free status
of the University of Pittsburgh,
the administration has yet to be
approached on the matter,
according to a Pitt official.

“I haven’t heard a word, and
until I hear something from either
the city or county there’s nothing
for us to do,” Pitt general counsel
Lewis Popper said yesterday. “No
one has asked us for anything.”

Popper added that he first
learned of the possible challenge

By Karen Speece
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
has received a $1.5 million grant
for a project studying new
treatments for people with high
cholesterol levels.

This project, titled “Models for
Treating High Blood Cholesterol,”
is sponsored by the National
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute
and will study ways to reduce
high blood-cholesterol levels in
adults.

Of the 37 applicants, Pitt’s
Graduate School of Public Health
was one of four places chosen to
conduct this project. The other

Student-athletes to face higher admissions standards

By Jeff Tatusko
Staff Writer

The Pitt athletic department,
criticized ' for recruiting
academically ineligible athletes,
is now facing stricter guidelines
for admission of student—ath1etes.

Under the new system, a
prospective student-athlete must
have a combined SAT score of
750, a grade-point average of 2.3
and rank in the top three—fifths of
his or her graduating class to be
automatically accepted. Students
are also required to have a 2.0
average in “core” classes such as
English, math and social sciences.

Oakland concert to raise funds for Kent State

Byjenifer Crook
Assistant News Editor

Students chatter carelessly in
the area known as Blanket Hill
on the grounds of Kent State
these days, just as students do on
every other college campus in
the country.

Nobody would ever guess that
this quiet, tree-covered area
where a gymnasium now stands
was the site of student bloodshed
nearly two decades ago.

That’s why many people, like
Pittsburgh resident Gary Doebler,
are upset.

Doebler is working with the
Tired of Waiting Committee, a
group which believes that
everyone who walks through

If an applicant does not meet
these standards, his records are
then subject to review by a special
panel, made up of Associate

Provost Jack Daniel, College of _
General Studies Dean John v

Bolvin, College of Arts and
Sciences Dean Mary Briscoe and
athletic director Edward Bozik.
There they will study the
candidate’s academic history and
make a recommendation to the
dean of the school that the student
is applying to.

Daniel, author of these new
standards, said that this committee
will not decide whether or not
the student is admitted. “The clean

Blanket Hill should be reminded
of May 4, 1970 —— the day a
contingent of Ohio National
Guardsmen opened fire on a
crowd protesting the Vietnam
War, killing four students. One of
them was Pittsburgh native Allison
Krause. _

To remember the slain students,
Doebler and other members of
the Remember Kent State
Committee are collaborating with
Tired of Waiting to raise funds for
a permanent monument at Kent
State. One of the fund— raising
projects will be held Jan. 12 at
The Upstage in Oakland.

Members of the groups say
they are taking the monument-
building matter into their own
hands, because Kent State officials

of the college that the student
applies to will make the ﬁnal
decision to accept the student,"
he said. “The committee will only
make a recommendation based
on whether or not we feel that
the student has a chance to
succeed academically.”

Daniel emphasized that these
are not new guidelines for
acceptance. “These admissions
guidelines are not minimal criteria
that automatically qualify student-
athletes for admission, nor are
they criteria for automatic
rejection,” he said.

Under these new regulations,
Daniel said that it is possible that

have yet to complete a fitting
monument at the site. In fact,
Doebler said the university has
practically denied that the tragedy
ever occurred.

“In 1975, the university
cancelled the annual memorial
service. And then they built the
gymnasium, which covers half of
the site. They also planted trees
in the area that the National Guard
fired from. Finally, in 1985, we
thought
somewhere when the university
pledged to build a $1.3 million
memorial."

But the optimism was short-
lived. University officials said that
the public was not interested
enough to donate money for the
project, and the funding was cut

we were getting-

an athlete who meets the
requirements under Proposition
48 still might not be admitted.
Under Proposition 48, an athlete
needs to score 700 on the SAT
and have a 2.0 grade-point
average to be academically
eligible to play a sport.
Bozik agreed, “We are not
cutting the athletes a break.”
Bozik said that these new
standards will not affect recruiting.
“If anything, they could help
recruiting,” he said. “Students will
feel that they will be attending a
good academic institution.”
Daniel echoed those
statements, “Parents will look at

by 93 percent to $100,000.

So even though construction
of the scaled-down version —
without the names of the students
— is underway, and the university
says it will not accept outside
funding to improve the project,
Tired of Waiting members say
that they will build a monument
of their own, off—campus if

necessary, to make sure the
students are properly
memorialized.

Another member of Tired of
Waiting, Alan Canfora, who was
shot in the wrist on May 4, also
stressed the importance of a
proper memorial. *

“I feel assaulted that my
university has created its own
version of history by trying to

the university and feel that their
child . will be getting a quality
education and not just use their
child as an athlete. Pitt is a place
to do the right thing.

“We can be a university to be
distinguished in both athletics
and academics,” Daniel said. “We
want to have two kinds of All-
Americans:.academic and athletic.
We believe we can have both.”

Daniel said that these standards
are not in response to last year’s
recruiting problems, when the
entire freshman class for the
basketball team was ruled
academically;ineligible.

memorial

sweep May 4 under the mg.
Instead, they should use the
events as a learning tool, so that
nothing like that ever happens
again.”

“For some people, it’s like when
Kennedy was shot. I remember
exactly where I was. For those of
us who were in that situation it
was a real shocker when those
students were killed. They
deserve a memorial with their
names on it, at least, ” said Doebler.

Doebler hopes that the Oakland
conceit will get the groups one
step closer to seeing the
monument’s completion. Three
bands, Carsickness, Vinyl Back
and The Earl Rays, are playing at
the concert, and a film, “The

Local ice creaﬁa parlor experiences the sweet taste of success

By Andrea Barczykowski
Staff Writer

Everyone loves ice cream, and
high quality gourmet ice cream is
a growing trend. Here in Oakland,

‘there is one place, renowned

locally and nationally, where ice
cream connoisseurs can find what
they’re looking for.

The place is Dave & Andy’s,
where they make their premium
ice cream right in the store.

Recently, Dave & Andy’s was
recognized in the latest “Best
Choice” book, a travel guide for

Canfora said that Tired of

ceremony for May 4, the 20th
anniversary of the shootings.
Organizers are hoping to book
Jesse Jackson as the speaker, and
get national media attention for
their cause. Then, he said,

Pennsylvania which can be used
by longtime residents as well as
tourists.

According to this book, “When
the ice cream bug bites, there’s
no better place to satisfy it than at
Dave & Andy’s Homemade Ice
Cream.”

The store is owned by Dave
Tuttle and Andy Hardie and has
been operating for six years.

Hardie thought of the idea after
taking a course in ice cream while
attending Penn State University.

Tuttle, who has relatives in

Boston and Vermont, also thought
it would be a good idea.

“There are a lot of gourmet ice
cream places in those areas; there
really wasn’t anything like that in
Pittsburgh," said T uttle.

The old-fashioned ice cream
makers mix the ice cream, which
is frozen by ice and rock salt,
right in the front window, enticing
many an unsuspecting victim into
the store. If you are not yet
completely hooked, the aroma
of the homemade wafﬂe cones
ensures a deﬁnite sale.

However, city and county officials

be taxed.

saying, “We are not required to

Popper also said that there is
no doubt that Pitt is a charitable
entity. “This is a quasi-public
institution which spends vast
sums in scholarships and research
grants for the public good."

Pittsburgh Press last week that

and cookies and cream are the
only daily ﬂavors, and since
they’ve opened Dave and Andy’s
has produced over 300 ﬂavors.

But the rise in health
consciousness has been
somewhat of a problem.

“The last few years haven't been
the best for us; a day doesn’t go
by when I don't read something
in the paper about high
cholesterol," said Tuttle. _

To make up for some of the
loss of sales, they have started

making light ﬂavors, which are 6
percent butterfat, and yogurt,
which is only 2 percent, in
comparison to the ‘regular ice
cream, which is 14 percent.

According to Tuttle, “The
regular ice cream still sells more
than these.”

Dave & Andy’s has also been
mentioned in the book, “The

to Find it,” which lists the best ice

Georgetown manhandles Panthers for 87-71 victory  

By Mike Rampa
Asst. Sports Editor

Considering how the Panthers have
fared in their Big East conference games
this season, it may not have come as a
surprise that the near capacity Civic Arena
crowdbecarne most vociferous in moments
when Pitt was able to keep itself down by
only eight to 10 points.

Georgetown brought its number two
ranking and a potent outside scoring
attack into Pittsburgh, in the form of
guards Mark Tillmon and Dwayne Bryant,
as the Hoyas handed Pitt its eighth loss of
the season and third conference loss in
three games before a national television
audience, 87-71. ‘

T illmon and Bryant combined for 48
points while inside men Alonzo Mourning
and Dikembe Mutombo teamed up for 23

  
 

points, 8 blocked shots and 12 rebounds.

“I’ve said from the beginning that
Georgetown will go the way of Tillmon
and Bryant," said Hoyas head coach John
Thompson.

“Anytime you have a great center like
Alonzo, the other parts of your game tend
to be overshadowed.”

The Hoyas began work early, going on
an eight point run in the first two minutes
of the contest The game was extremely
physical early on, with excessive contact
under the boards involving Mourning,
Brian Shorter and Bobby Martin. Shorter
was called for a technical foul at 19:11.

“They [Shorter and Mourning] shoved
and Shorter retaliated, which he probably
shouldn’t have, but you don’t want him to
back down to a kid like that either,” Pitt
head coach Paul Evans said.

‘ “I just think that Mourning gets away

with a little more than he should," he said.

The Hoyas superior quickness at almost
all positions on the floor and near ﬂawless
execution built their lead to a comfortable
33-17 margin midway through the first half
before Pitt answered with an six point run
to cut the lead to 33-23.

But the tandem of Tillmon and Bryant
took over for the remainder of the half and
knocked down 13 points to give the Hoyas
a comfortable 52-33 halftime lead.

The Panthers had trouble with the
overpowering size of 7’2" forward Mutombo
and the 6'10" center Mourning. Pitt
occasionally took several off-balance jump
shots resulting in Georgetown rebounds.
Also, Pitt’s inside game became flustered,
especially as guards Jason Matthews and
Darelle Porter attempted to drive to the
hoop and score from the inside over the
twin towers. At times, the Panthers’ game

was sloppy and confused, resulting in
several turnovers.

“Coach Thompson has given them the
freedom to take outside shots and they
have excellent rebounding in Dikembe
and Alonzo,” Porter said. ‘

“Dikembe has improved his game so
much. When Alonzo is out, he can still be
a force inside and block shots," he said.

The Hoyas’ famous full court pressure
and tenacious defense gave Pitt -some
problems, but Georgetown’s successful
substitutions and depth allowed their big
guns to rest while the bench took on Pitt’s
starting five. In total, five Hoyas off the
bench saw action and allowed Georgetown
to keep up its intensity in full court
pressure while allowing the starters to
regroup.

In 1976, a motion picture which
told the moving story of a two-bit
prizefighter was released for
public viewing.

The boxer, who made his home
in a Pennsylvania city, had little
hope of ever becoming a world
champion, let alone winning
enough fights to put food on his
supper table. He just wasn't swift
enough. Or quick enough. His
trainer at the local gY‘h more than
suggested that he hang up the
gloves and, in a sense, get on

with his life’s work.

He almost did.

Three games into the Big East basketball season, the Pitt Panthers find themselves
exactly where they were three games ago in one respect: without a win.

The Georgetown Hoyas ensured Pitt’s worst league start since it joined the league ’in_
1983, defeating the Panthers 87-71 at the Civic Arena last night. ,

It was the fourth straight loss for Pitt, which has dropped consecutive games to
Georgia Tech (111—92), Syracuse (80-78), Connecticut (79-61) and the Hoyas, and the
first time under Coach Paul Evans that the Panthers have lost four consecutive games.
Pitt is 5-8 overall, 0-3 in conference play. _

But don’t feel bad for Evans or his team. They played even with then number one-
ranked Syracuse and made a dramatic run at the Hoyas, No. 2 inthe most recent polls.
3 “I’m concerned about it, but  we’ve lost to some of the teams we lost to last year,
 didn’t lose to Syracuse as badly at home and we’re not playing terrible except for the
Connecticut game," said Evans.

Pitt lost to all three league opponents last year, including a 10380 loss to the
Orangemen at the Arena.

“Two out of three losses we played the number one team in the nation and the number
three team in the nation,” said Panther guardJason Matthews, who had 15 points. “We’re
not down. We know we’ve played Georgetown and Syracuse, who are supposed to be
the two toughest teams in the league. We’ve got St. John's coming up. We've just started,
it's only three games in, and we’ve still got 13 to go. And we’ve ‘already played
Georgetown and Syracuse so it's not like we can’t turn it around."

But the odds — and the numbers - are stacked-against the Panthers. The Hoyas used
five reserves last night, getting 60 minutes, 12 points, six rebounds and eight assists. Pitt
used two substitutes for a grand total of 11 minutes, 0 points, one assist and two personal J

ending with pure disappointment
yet acknowledging underlying
triumph.

Reﬂecting on the team's overall
season-long performance, the

Pittsburgh Steelers simply did not .

belong in the semifinals of the
AFC playoffs, two steps away
from the Super Bowl.

But after a strange, up-and-
down season where the lows
touched bottom in a bottomless
pit while the highs were rarely
above eye-level, the Steelers, too,
were there. Pittsburgh got hot at
the right time, and via the NFL’s

the playoffs. And all they needed
was a shot.

After squeaking by a slumping

  The Wonder Yeozr
In his inaugural address, President Bush stated, “A new
breeze is blowing, and a world refreshed by freedom

seems reborn.” Although in hindsight the president’s
statement appears quite prophetic, he surely didn’t antici-

Ai pate the tornado—like speed of that breeze.

By the time that the year of 1989 would pass, the world
would witness astonishing changes in Poland, Hungary,

1 . Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and East Germany —— climaxed

by the execution of .a communist dictator in Romania by
“the people.”

The Eastern European countries that fell to communism
like dominoes have now begun to stand back up. The Iron
Curtain, which has been closed for over 40 years, has
begun to part.

1989 will be earmarked in history as an amazing year
which saw unprecedented changes in the political struc-
ture of much of the world. It will seemingly appear as a
specific. year with a designated purpose: the forfeiting of

an ideology which was initially (and ironically) geared ,

toward a utopian world — communism. Indeed, 1989
marked the beginning of the end for communism.

Former Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev’s prediction
that the East’s Marx-fueled economic engines would leave
the West’s economies puttering in the dust by the mid-
1970s proved highly inaccurate.

In 1989 the people of the Eastern bloc stood up and
remonstrated: enough is enough. Their dissatisfaction
was also voiced by Chinese pro—democracy demonstra-
tors, with not quite the same happy ending.

1989 has been an amazing year. What happened to
communism? Why did it so dismally fail?

As Americans and residents of the free world, let's not
seize Lenin’s failure as an opportunity to gloat but take
it as a time to remind and to teach.

T79eBlunder Year

James Madison once wrote, “In framing a government
which is to be administered by men over men, the great
difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government
to control the governed; and in the next place, oblige it to
control itself.” And in regard to our government’s control-
ling itself, how did our legislative branch perform in 1989?

Well, although the United States can now claim some
global bragging rights as we watch communist systems
modeled after the Soviet Union reform into more West-
oriented governments, we can’t exactly be elated over our
own domestic appearance in 1989. We saw our Congress
involved in seemingly insatiable scandal after scandal.

Congress kicked off the year with the savings and loan
scandal, followed by the john Tower debacle, the resig-
nations ofjim Wright and Tony Coelho, Barney Frank and
the HUD scandal and is now finishing up 1989 with the
“Lincoln Five” senators of the Lincoln savings and loan
scandal — the afterbirth of the Savings and Loan ﬁasco.

To compound its dirty appearance created by the
scandals, Congress outraged Americans when it promised
to halt the ethics violations in exchange for a $30,000 pay
raise.

Surely, this isn’t exactly what the Founding Fathers
aimed for when they convened to write up the Constitution
some 200 years ago.

Does the ’G’ in GRE stomdfor Gmduozte?

There are many ways for people
to receive self-inﬂicted wounds.
One could watch “A Very Brady
Bar Mitzvah,” take the Pitt Pro-
gram Council’s tour of Scranton,
play New Kids on the Block rec-
ords backwards or read any ar-
ticle in The New Republic. I have
dodged all these triﬂing annoy-
ances and rushed pencil-first into
the greatest migraine of all by
taking the Graduate Record Exam
(GRE).

First, I must state that I didn’t
take the GRE because I’m apply-

" ing to graduate schools —— most

of which require these scores.
But instead, unfortunatelyfor me,
after transferring to Pitt last year
and then having switched my
major for the fourth time, this
time to Women’s Studies (I’ll be
a sixth-year senior) — over
Thanksgiving break I saw a
Woody Allen ﬁlm festival and, in
the process, became so neurotic
that I applied to take the exam.
Jump to 8 a.m., Saturday, Dec.
9. The place: Commons Room,
Cathedral of Learning. The place
was wall-to-wall study geeks.

' When you get your admission

ticket it tells you exactly what to
bring: two forms of identiﬁcation,
three orfour pencils, your admis-
sion ticket, maybe an eraser; no
more, no less.

It's amazing how many poten-
tial grad students do not know
how to read. Many people brought
food. What? You’re gonna munch
on that kumquat in between 15-
second breaks? And pencils —
people brought enough wood
for an Amazon jungle, and that’s
not all. Students brought pens
and markers. The guy who sat
next to” me during the exam
brought his own pencil box that
played “Onward, Christian Sol-
diers” when it was opened. I had
to jump on one of the tables and
plead, “People, people, work with
me! You’re not going to need all
this equipment. And you, yes,
you with the protractor; put the
typewriter away!”

But the carnival was far from

being over. Some people brought
books; more than one had
brought their GRE practice book-
let along. I sincerely‘ doubted
that the GRE proctors were going
to let us refer to the practice
booklet in between rounds.
Worst of all was the young
woman who brought a box of
Kleenex with her. Mind you, this
wasn't one of those compact 15-
tissue jobs that can be slipped
easily into a pocket (or if you’re
like me, a tennis shoe). No, this
was an entire family-sized box of

 

Kleenex, the type that always
has one tissue sticking straight
out of the box. I was tempted to
ask her if she brought her own
roll of Charmin too, but decided
that it was too gauche and the
line could be put to better use in
my column where my hall mates
could appreciate the ribald humor
just as much.

But the pinnacle of the..crowd’s
odyssey into boobville was when
one of the GRE proctors gath-
ered us around to tell us our
seating locations. He would call
out letters followed by a building
and room number. If the first
letter of your last name was
mentioned, then the building and
room number which proceeded
it would be your destination.
Simple, right? Not really. After
the proctor was finished, he said
that he’d post the list “just in case
one or two of you missed your
spot." I wish some grad school
committees could have been
there to see their potential stu-
dents scrambling to the wall
because their memories could
not work for over five minutes.
(And people call me stupid
because I watch shows like
“College Mad House” and

“Stooge-fest.”)

Unlike the rest of the stam-

pede, I had remembered my room
number and set off for the School
of Law. For the next eight hours
or so I crawled my way through
two exams: the general GRE and
the GRE in literature. I was deter-
mining the fate of my academic
future by filling in little circles
with teeny-tiny letters inside of
them. I would love to say a little
about the type of questions asked,
but I am barred from doing so.
Once everyone “is seated for

the exam, the lights go out and
from behind a shroud of fog a
GRE proctor emerges, dressed
like Mephistopheles, humming a
Gregorian chant. A scirnitar is
then passed around, and all stu-
dents must certify, in their own
blood, that they will not “dis-
close the contents of the testI am
taking today to anyone.” We
Pittsburgh Press is sending out a
special reporter to see if there is
anything satanic about the cere-
mony; the lengths Angus
McEachran will go to for a Pulit-
zer.

By S p.m., I was finished with
the second exam. Although the
whole experience wasn't one I
would wish to repeat, when I
was actually in the midst of an-
swering the questions, the min-
utes sped by. Probably the most
disconcerting idea behind the
GRE is its worth. I talked to Pitt's
graduate secretary and though
she assured me that the scores
were indeed important, they were
mainly used as a tie-breaker. Also,
an average and even not—so aver-
age score could be compensated
for by an outstanding ‘writing
sample and GPA.

At a cost of about $75 for both
exams, not to mention additional
charges for scores to be sent to
more than a few grad schools, it's

a pretty expensive tie-breaker— I

one that a lower—income student
could literally not afford to lose.

Time for America to use its
Trumpcard.

Columbia Pictures. CBS Rec-
ords. Flintstones vitamins. Q—Tips.
Citibank. The Rockefeller Center.
All of these ﬁne American institu-
tions have one thing in common.
They aren't American anymore.

And that's not even half of it.
Approximately 30 percent of the
prime office space in Los Angeles
belongs to the Japanese, who
have increased their holdings in
America by well over 100 percent
in the past few years. Great Brit-
ain's investments in the United
States dwarf even Japanese hold-
ings, but their insidious takeover
is less publicized because it does
not control as many landmarks of
Americana. West Germany also
has a surprisingly large interest in

our finances. In short, America is

being bought out by foreign

investors. And if something isn't
done about it soon, America is
going to fall out of its melting pot
and land in the fire.

But what can we do? With
much of the federal budget being
allocated to the military, and the
omnipresent national debt always
lurking in the background, what
possible action can we take? We
have no money to work with.
Without some cold, hard cash to
back up our interests, who will
take us seriously? All 10 of the
most important banks in the world
are currently controlled by the

Japanese. How does one con-

front such an economic empire?
What America needs is a hero.
Someone who can get in there

and play hardball with the big
boys. Someone with the guts, the
brains and the funds to match our
foreign competitors. But where
can we find such a hero? Allow
me to make a suggestion.

 

Ladies and gents, I give you
Donald Trump!

Hey — stop looking at me like
that — I'm serious! Don is deﬁ-
nitely the man to get it all back for
us. Nobody wheels and deals
like the King of Capitalism. Put
him in the playpen with some of

those other big—shot investors and
pretty soon we've got a country
again. We may have to consider
renaming it, but at least it'll still
be ours. ‘

I realize Donny doesn’t have
an ideal reputation. I mean, how
many mothers encourage their
kids to grow up to become self-
ish, greedy, conceited misers who
crave power more than food?
ButI am sure all of these accusa-
tions are false, trumped up by

some poor, jealous slob who can
only dream of making the kind of
/money Don makes in his sleep.
I'll bet he’s a really personable
kind of guy. I'll bet if we ask him
really nicely, he might just do us
a favor and buy back some of
America. In return, he would
improve his image and become a

It ’s about time for America to play its T rump card

national hero. We could even
give him his very own holiday.
The man cannot lose.

What do you say, Don? It's not
like you’ll lose anything on the
deal. Buy back Rockefeller
Center. Radio City Music Hall
makes enough profit in one year

to make up the difference, don't‘

you agree? Or, how about Co-
lumbia Pictures? The video in-
dustry has got tolbe one of the
most profitable and expanding
businesses there is. You'll make
out like a bandit. We'll be proud
of you, of ourselves and of
America. What more could you
ask for?

All right, all right. We'll call it
Trump Center. ’

The Pitt News.

New York is a city where life
‘ comes and goes, and no one
cares or stops to notice.
Pittsburgh certainly does not
suffer from this problem. I, like
most other Pittsburghers (by
the way, what is a Pitts-
burgher?), always thought that
apathy was not a problem in
Pittsburgh like it is stereotypi-
cally characterized in New
York. However, even if Pitts-
burgh is not as bad as New
York, there is still a problem
with apathy in this city. Here
are a few local issues which are
so often brushed aside by
apathetic Pittsburghers.
Apathy is common through-
out the city, and it also exists at
the University of Pittsburgh.
Granted, there are quite a few
students at Pitt who are not

lot who are from this city.
Speaking for myself, I would
not and could not attend a
university in any city in Amer-
ica without having an interest

from Pittsburgh, but there are 21.

Both city and campus

in that city and caring about that
city. This year the tuition for Pitt
went up by $55.00 because of
some computer fee that no one
understands. This fee is going to
double to $110.00 next year.
The Port Authority Transit (PAT)
bus lane on Fifth Avenue, which
has caused many injuries and
accidents involving Pitt students
over the course of its existence,
has been temporarily out of serv-
ice for about six months. There
has been some discussion by PAT
about ending its usage forever.
The U-tickets that enabled Pitt
students to ride the buses for 75
cents instead of $1 have been

discontinued this January. In‘

addition, the standard bus fare
has been raised to $1.10.

The Penguins are a great hockey
team, but they still do not get a lot
of respect around the NHL. In
addition, the name of the team is
the Penguins -— think about it.
The Steelers are a good football
team that cannot get a break, and
they almost defeated themselves.

apathy runa

Plus, Chuck Noll has a lifetime
contract as the head coach. Per-
sonally, I am not a big fan of
Chuck Noll. The Pirates are a
good team with a cheap group of
CEOs of Pittsburgh companies
as their owners. It is a good team

 

with a bad -manager. rather than
a bad team with a good manager.
Syd Thrift was fired, and Jim

Leyland was kept. The ill feel-'

ings between. Terry Bradshaw
and Chuck Noll have caused
Bradshaw to insult Pittsburgh by
refusing to talk to members of
the media in this city or to ever
retum to Pittsburgh. The Pitts-
burgh sports fans are fair-weather
fans who only attend sporting
events if the teams are winning

rampant in Pittsburgh

—— except for the Steelers. Yet in
the case of the Steelers, the fans
go to the games and then boo
them when they are losing.

The bureaucracy at Pitt is in-
credibly vast and inconvenient,
and yet the university is the
prototype for universities in the
future. The Pitt book center has
a monopoly on textbook sales
on campus, and it can charge
whatever it wants and make all
the rules itself. The unemploy-
ment rate in Pittsburgh is low,
but it is an adjusted rate that
does not include steelworkers,
many of whom are still unem-
ployed about 10 years after steel
ceased to be an important and
significant industry in this city.
Many people around America
still think of Pittsburgh as a steel
town, which is certainly not
true.

Sophie Masloff is the mayor
of Pittsburgh. The president of
City Council, Ben Woods, was
found ‘guilty of unethical ac-
tions in his position. The cam-

pus police used to eat dough-
nuts, and now they are upset
because they aren't allowed to
anymore. The Pittsburgh po-
lice are vulgar and violent;
they verbally and physically
abuse citizens, and then they
are found not guilty by the
trial-board system. Pittsburgh
is not the No. 1 most livable
city in America anymore. Se-
attle is.

These are many of the issues
that I feel are important and
significant in Pittsburgh. I know -
thatl care about them, butI do
not know if other people are
concerned. Do students at Pitt
care about these issues? D0
citizens in Pittsburgh care
about these issues? Pittsburgh
is a great city with a good
university and many wonder-
ful students and citizens.
Apathy should not be a prob-
lem in this city.

David W. Matta is a colum-
m'stforThe Pitt News.

A Christmas in South Oa/eland is a Christmas

I had a terrible Christmas break,
OK? It was wretched.

The reason why — and this
should pretty much explain it -
is that I spent Christmas break in

plush and luxurious South
Oakland.

South Oakland is not the great-
est place to live during the year.
Even the rats complain about the
noise and the mess. But you have
never experienced the joys of
South Oakland until you have
spent your Christmas break in
this paradise.

The thing that made it so bad
during the break was the fact that
there was nobody here. I mean
not a soul, except for me that is.
All three of my friends were gone.
All hundreds of my enemies were
gone. Even the homeless people
that sleep on my sidewalk were
gone.

South Oakland was completely

desolate — I looked outside my
abode and there weren’t even
any cars on the street. Nothing
but subzero temperatures, tons
of dirty snow andheaps of de-
pression that hang on you like fat
on Aunt Marge.

Meanwhile, my girlfriend called
me from Miami to say, “I'm ex-
hausted from all the things I've
been doing and places I've been
seeing, but it's too hot to sleep
and I have a bit of a sunburn." I
was as green as lime Jell-O with
envy.

That's when I broke the phone
by accidentally hitting it with a
ball peen hammer a couple of
million times. The next day I
hired Louie Cappacola, a Miami
drug lord, to have my girlfriend
hunted down and shot.

At that point, I had neither a
phone nor a girlfriend. So I took
her Christmas gifts back and

bought a case of cheap bourbon.
For the next few days, I sat on my
couch, drinking bourbon and
watching MTV nonstop. I boozed

 

every night until dawn and slept
every day until 5 p.m. By the time
I would return to consciousness,
night would already have fallen.
I became submerged in perpet-
ual darkness.

I realized that I was starting to
lose my mind.

Then, on the second day of the

. break, right in the middle of “Yo!
MTV Raps,"- the electricity went
off. In a drunken rage due to the

intermption of a DJ‘ Jazzy Jeff
video, I hurled an empty bottle of
bourbon which busted through
my living room window and
knocked the only Christmas
decoration that I had out onto
the street. By then, I had no girl-
friend, phone, electricity or heat
— things were looking dismal. '
I sat in total darkness for ﬁve
days, drinking bourbon and
contemplating nouveau and ar-
tistic ways to kill myself. When
the electricity finally came back
on, along with a New Kids on the
Block video on the television, I
mentally snapped and decided to
sharpen the blades of my ceiling
fan, turn on a Cult album really
loud, set the ceiling fan on high
and throw myself into the ravag-
ing blades. Unfortunately, the fan
is made of plastic. Soon, all of the
blades were broken off, and I
was left with nothing but minor

in Hell...

cuts and abrasions.

At that point I realized there
was only one thing left to do, so
I took a cab to my parents’ house
in the suburbs. I was so happy to
see them that I admitted to my
mom and dad that I was wrong in
voting for Michael Dukakis.
“Really?” my mom asked with
tears in her conservative eyes.
“We knew that you would come
to your senses, son,” my father
said as he gave me that fatherly
chuck on the shoulder.

The three of us toasted George
Bush with a glass of rubbing
alcohol. Everything didn't snap
back to normal; my sanity didn't
return. But from that moment on
it was a kindler, gentler Christ-
mas.

Scott Armstrong and Shelly
Sleith recently got very nice
bonuses for being athletes at Pitt.

Armstrong, a three-year
letterman on the Pitt soccer team,
was chosen by the University of
Pittsburgh to receive the Athletics
Director’s Scholarship for the
1989-1990 school year. The award
is given annually to a senior
walk-on member of a Pitt men’s
varsity team who has been on
the team for three years and has

demonstrated exceptional work
ethic, character and team attitude.

Sleith, a member of the Pitt
women’s gymnastics team, was
chosen as the recipient of the
Myra Bachuchin Spadafore
Memorial Scholarship, which goes
to a senior member of women’s
varsity team at Pitt. The awardee
must also be a three year non-
scholarship walk-on and display
qualities similar to the winner of
the Athletics Director's
Scholarship.

Both awards are for $3,000.

“We are deeply grateful that

the University is able to provide
a reward for the diligence and
persistence of the walk-on
student athletes. Walk-ons are a
necessary part of every athletic
team," said Pitt Athletics Director
Ed Bozik.

Armstrong, a material science
engineering major, said it is not
always easy to balance the time
needed for the class room and
the time needed on the soccer
field, but he’s glad he did.

showing off his athletes," said
Armstrong. “After four years to
get a nice award like that makes
you appreciate Pitt even more as
a university." _

Sleith’s scholarship means more
to her than just receiving the
ﬁnancial help. Sleith knew Myra
Bachuchin Spadafore, for whom,
the scholarship was named.
Spadafore, an All-American
gymnast for Pitt in the early 1980’s,
died in 1987 after a prolonged
illness. Before her death,
Spadafore coached Sleith
gymnastics and the two became
friends.

“I was real excited to get the
scholarship because she taught
me a lot about gymnastics. I also

knew her personally, so it
probably meant more to me than
it would to someone who didn't
know her. I’m honored,” said
Sleith.

Sleith, a mathematics major,
started her gymnastic career at
Pitt as a substitute, but by her
sophomore year she was the top
all-arounder on the team. She
was also theMVP of the team that
year. She spent some of last season
with injuries, but came back to
record personal highs on the vault
and bars.

“Shelly has always been a
positive role model for our walk-
ons and recruited gymnasts alike.
She is always working hard
because she wants to and not
because she has to,” said Pitt
women’s gymnastics coach
Debbie Yohman.

Youth and experience lead Pitt

By Sean Hellman
Staff Writer

The Pitt women's basketball
team is now 8-4 overall after a
busy holiday.

The Lady Panthers scored
victories over Duquesne (88-51)
and Eastern Michigan (87-76) and
bowed to West Virginia (80-65).

Pitt also traveled to Miami, Fla.,
for the Burger King Holiday
Classic and finished in fourth
place with two wins and one
loss.

Pitt opened the tournament by
losing to Michigan, 71-5,9. They
bounced back for wins against
Cleveland State (80-52) and
Florida International (76-71).

Pitt began the new decade with
its first Big East game, losing at
Providence 98-74 on Jan. 3.
Providence is one of the top
teams in the conference.

‘On Saturday, Pitt beat
Georgetown 85-72, at Fitzgerald
Field House and is now 1-1 in the
Big East. -

The Lady Panthers had to
contend with a tough, defensive
Georgetown team. Previously, the
Lady Hoyas (0-1 in the
conference) held the top-ranked
Connecticut team to 54 points.

Before the game, Pitt head

coach Kirk Bruce said he hoped

to score at least in the 705 against
Georgetown.

However, Bruce has had to
make some adjustments in the
starting lineup due to an injury to
senior guard Jennifer Shingler.
Shingler reaggravated a previous
ankle injury early in the Cleveland
State game at the Burger King
Classic. Her status is day—to-day,
Coach Bruce said, and they will
make sure her ankle is healed
100 percent before she is ready
to play again.

Coach Bruce started freshman
Lisa Fessler at shooting guard
and moved, freshman Jill
McElhinny from guard to small

forward, a position she played in _

high school. ,

Senior Rita Anderson has also
seen time interchanging with
Fessler at guard.

“They have both been playing
very well," said Bruce. “Rita
played good in Miami, and Lisa
has played good all year.”

Anderson saw only 33 minutes
of playing time before Shingler’s
injury, but Bruce had decided to
use her against the Lady Hoyas.

“Rita's got a lot more conﬁdence
now, and she's keeping it up,”
said Bruce. “Her mental state of

mind has been better, probably 7

because she has seen more
playing time.”

Pitt fell behind early 4-0, but
Lorri Johnson got the Lady
Panthers going with four quick-
baskets to build an 8-6 lead.

The rest of the team followed
Lorri’s lead. Maureen McConnell
hit a 3-pointer, andJi1l McElhinny
scored on a layup and hit two
free throws for a 15-14 lead.

The ﬁrst half was played close,
with both teams playing tight
man-to-man defenses allowing
few fast breaks. The ﬂow of the
game went against Pitt’s style of
a quicker, run-up-and-down-the-
court type of game.

But Pitt kept it close. The first

half had nine lead changes as Pitt
took a 34-32 lead into halftime.

The pace of the game in the
second half contrasted the ﬁrst.
The quick tempo seemed to favor
Pitt.

Pitt’s ﬁrst three -scores of the
second half were 3-pointers by
Johnson, Fessler and McConnell.

The whole team played a part
in the second-half run which
took Pitt’s lead into double digits.

Fessler and Anderson hit
consistently from the outside.
Connie Hurt, Pitt’s 6-foot-4 center,
added four blocked shots. Turia
Ransom had 12 rebounds.
McConnell and Johnson were
doing the job both inside and
outside.

McConnell’s ball handling
broke an occasional Georgetown
1-3-1 full-court press. She kept
the Lady Hoyas off guard by
driving tothebasketseveral times,
something she has not done all
year. 1

“Maureen was a little content
with taking a 3-pointer and
ninning the break and dishing it
off,” said Bruce. “That's ﬁne, but
she has a lot more ability than
that. She made a drive, got fouled
on one, got a rebound on one.
She’s getting better every game.”

McConnell was matched against
a junior guard, Maria Ayres.

“Ayres has been around the
league,” said Bruce. “Maureen
did whatever she wanted to
against that girl. She played a
near-perfect game.”

McConnell scored a career high
18 points with seven assists.

Bruce added, “If you can get
that out of any freshman, that's a
nice game.”

McConnell was named Big East
Player of the Week for her
performances.

Pitt shot 55 percent from the
ﬁeld. It was only the second time
this year that Pitt shot over 50
percent (53 percent against
Eastern Michigan).

All-American candidate Lorri

_ Johnson has felt the effects of the

recent schedule. She had
reconstructive surgery on both
knees in 1986, and they may be
wearing down.

During breaks against
Georgetown she had the trainer
help her with stretching exercises.
Coach Bruce has been trying to
keep her out of the game
whenever possible.

“We don’t know [if she can
handle it],” said Bruce.

keeping up the tempo we want to play at,” Thompson said.
“When Dwayne [Bryant] and Mark [Tillman] get impatient or

foul up the press, we always have an answer to that problem

in the form of the bench.”
The Panthers fought to within 1 1 points ﬁve minutes into the

second half as the crowd ﬁnally began to show some emotion

while the Panthers showed faint signs of a possible comeback.

team.

But the crowd was silenced until there were six minutes left
as Shorter slammed over Mourning, and as Matthews and Rod
Brookin stole two consecutive in-bounds passes from the
Hoyas to bring the Panthers back to within eight points at 77-
69 with only four minutes remaining.

Porter thought his team was ready to take control.

“I got real emotional out there. I saw the look on some of their
players’ faces and they looked like they didn't know what to -
do. I thought we had a real good chance," Porter said.

Pitt would have had an even better chance if the Big East had
not adopted the six foul rule this season, as Mourning already
had ﬁve personals during the Pitt run. "

Panther coach Paul Evans expressed his dissatisfaction with
the new rule and said that it always hurts, rather than helps, his

“The six foul rule certainly doesn't help us. All these idiots
that say ‘I don't know why Evans isn't voting for it’ is going to
help them. All you have to do is look at this game and the past
couple of games. Both of those kids, Mutombo and Mourning
would have fouled out of the game." '

Thompson was not surprised at the ease with which he was
able to defeat the Panthers.

“I think we all have to realize that we're talking about
youngsters that have just come off two tough losses, and when
that happens, it’s very difﬁcult to get back on the right track.

“And anytime when you have lost your point guard, the
center of your people, it’s very difficult," Thompson said.

did

The Steelers weren’t supposed
to jump out to a 10-0 lead over
John Elway and the stunned
Broncos. Quarterback Bubby
Brister’s passing wasn’t supposed
to be as sharp as the Rocky
Mountain skyline. Merril Hoge
wasn’t supposed to plow across
the turf like the Merrill Lynch bull
for a career-high 120 yards and
the fourth-best rushing
performance in Steeler playoff
history. The defense wasn’t
supposed to be as stubborn and
unyielding as it was.

“I kept thinking, ‘What’s

_ happening here?” said Broncos

defensive end Ron Holmes,

' whose team had thrashed the

Steelers 34-7 earlier in the season.

“We knew what they were
going to do out there. They didn’t
do too many things differently,
and we weren’t able to stop
them, ” said Denver safety Dennis
Smith. “They did everything they
had to do to win.”

For well over three quarters,
one of the greatest of upsets was
ripening, like apples on a tree in
the heat of a Latrobe summer.

And in the end, the Steelers
weren't supposed to lose the
way they did.

The team never trailed and
even had the lead with 2:28
remaining in the game before
Mel Bratton crashed over the
Pittsburgh goal line to break the
Steelers’ and their fans’ hearts.

The Steelers outplayed Denver
in nearly every facet. Really, they

had no other choice. The Steelers
had to play perfect football if
they wanted to complete an upset
of the best team in the American
Football Conference. No glaring

mistakes could be made. They.

almost pulled it off.
Four mistakes away:

-The Steeler prevent defense
allowed Elway to complete two
passes of 15 and 26 yards with
under 0:30 left in the first half to
set up a 43-yard David T readwell
field goal to cut Denver's deficit
to 17-10.

-Tailback Tim Worley fumbled
on the Steelers’ ﬁrst possession of
the second half to give the
Broncos the ball at the Pittsburgh
37. On the very next play, Elway
hit Vance Johnson for a wide-
open, game-tying touchdown.

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Tuesday, January 9, 1990

-On ﬁrst and 10 on their own 20
and trailing 24-23 late in the game,
rookie wide receiver Mark Stock
dropped an excellent rollout pass
from Brister at the Steeler 35,
creating an undesirable second-
and-long situation and raising up
the already unbearable Denver
crowd noise another 20 decibels.
oTwo plays later, on third and
10, a low snap out of the shotgun
from center Chuck Lanza to
Brister, which Brister mishandled,
fell into enemy hands, and the
epic challenge was over.

That was it. That was the ball’

game.
The Steelers and Chuck Noll
should be proud. They showed

 

season's start They showed guts.
They showed heart.

But in the NFL, in any sport,
winning is what counts Winners
are the ones remembered in time.
Don Shula, head coach of the
Miami Dolphins, said minutes
after his team lost the legendary
41-38 shoot-out to the San Diego
Chargers in the 1981 AFC
semiﬁnal, “I’ve never been more
proud of a team, in my life." He
paused, then added ﬁrmly, “That
didn’t win."

in dreams, it was all too good to

the league, the nation, that they be true.

that haunted them from the But, hey, what a show.

Games

Continued from page 5

Brookin and Matthews played all 40 minutes last night, while Darelle
Porter and Bobby Martin were in for 33 and 36 minutes, respectively.

“I think by now all of us realize that we’re going to have to play 40
minutes a game,” said Matthews. “We’re going to have to accept it,
and get our proper rest and relax as much as we can when we’re
not playing.”

In the next 18 days, Pitt plays St. John’s, Seton Hall, Syracuse,
Arizona and Boston College. Three are Top 20 programs. The
Panthe_rs lost to all but St. John’s and Arizona last season and have lost
to Syracuse at home this year. It’s the type of schedule that no coach
envies.

“It wasn’t a great beginning schedule,” said Evans. “When you’ve
got to play Syracuse and Georgetown in the first week with
Connecticut on the road, and now we’ve got to St. John’s which may
be the third best team in the conference, it’s not a great way to start
the conference.

“All we’ve got to do is keep the kids up and keep them so they don’t
get down and don’t quit like they didn’t do tonight and I think they’re
still going to win their share of games,” he added.

The Panthers have at least 15 remaining games, seven in Pittsburgh.
Pitt went 17-12 en route to the NCAA Tournament last season. To
match that victory total, the Panthers would have to win 12 games.
Thirteen wins would give them 18 victories, and no Big East squad

that has won 18 games has been overlooked by the NCAA Tourney -

commiuee. Ever.

“We still have a good shot at coming in second or third place in the
Big East,” said an optimistic Porter. “We got the two hardest teams out
of the way."
