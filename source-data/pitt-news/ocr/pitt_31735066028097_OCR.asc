Playing Ilie
Pill game

Do what you love. Get involved. Or risk losing out.

lllllllllll BIOZIIIGIIII

Many students come to a uni-
versity to prepare for jobs and ﬁnd
freedom, but at a school where so
many different people and ideas can
change the direction of a person’s
life, it’s easy to get lost in the shuﬁle.

Tuition makes it a gamble.
While there are 8,000 more
Pennsylvania state grants given out
this year, the cost of college has also
risen.

But enrollment has, too.

Something keeps bringing peo-
ple in, and virtually everything from
politics to parties, research to recre-
ation, and activism to apathy can be
found within the shadow of the
Cathedral of Learning.

Theoretically, those things are
all packed into a diploma on gradua-
tion night. And students are now

realizing that the diploma is about"

more than getting a job.

Jean Koesel, a Pit counselor,
said some see the college experience
as more than class. It’s a way of life
and a time of experiment — a
chance to test the world while still
tethered to the safety ofa classroom
or Mom and Dad’s bankbook.
Koesel said the safety net of college
may make it easy for students to
experiment in sexuality, drugs, rela-
tionships or social activism while
still trying to choose a career for the
years ahead

“Hopefully it’s healthy experi-
mentation, but I guess it depends on
who a person is and what they want
todo,” Koesel said “Thisisatimein
many students’ lives when they are
moving on into adulthood It’s prob-
ably made easier for some to have
school or family to fall back on.”

Koesel said becoming active on
campus is a good way to ﬁnd a niche
and gain a voice in campus issues,
but she added some students prefer
to stay on the sidelines and hope for
the best

While a large school like Pitt
can give a student a comfortable
sense of anonymity, a chance to start
over, Student Government President
Justin DalMolin said a student must
be careful not to become “a num-
W.”

He said that no matter who you
are or what your interests may be,
activism on campus is becoming the
only way to get what you want at a
large school. It may also be a way for
some students to ﬁnd their niche at
Pitt.

At a school that’s often been
divided by indifference, some stu-
dents and administrators are now
saying that if Pitt is a game then
they’re tired of playing
against one another.
Here are some exam-

 

shown him that students want more
information about professors before
signing up for. classes. “Some stu-
dents have also mentioned that they
are interested in the evaluations of
faculty performance, and I certainly

thinkthatneedstobelookedintol

carefully,” MacLeod said

Because many students said
that general education requirements
needed to be simpliﬁed, Peter
Koehler, Dean of the
Faculty of Arts and
Sciences, says he and

ples. Associate Dean David
DalMolin says he Brumble will begin

their concerns in the Board of “We will pick our brains about

Trustees, the group that oversees the
entire University.

Currently negotiating with
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg to let
student representatives sit in on
Trustee committee meetings,
DalMolin says the move could give
students a voice in issues such as
housing, class registration and food
services —— things of which he says
Trustees have no ﬁrst-hand knowl-
edge.

"Ihere has to be a collective
effort here. I don’t think administra-
tors inﬂuence anybody, because they
don’t have close contact with stu-
dents,” he said

The many communities within
Pitt must start working together to
reach their individual goals, accord-
ing to Dr. Gordon MacLeod, the
new president of the University
Senate.

He said he’d like the Senate,
which is a forum for Pitt students
and employees, to encourage further
diversity on campus and a greater
sense of community. He said he’d
also like state and local government
ofﬁcials to meet members of the
Senate to discuss political issues
relating to the University.

“I’d like to have people talking
to each other,” he said “I’d also like
to see the student population become
more a mirror ofthe national popu-
lation.” MacLeod also said the
Senate will examine ways to rejuve-
nate Pitt’s faculty through an early
retirement package.

Student activism has also

what’s good and what’s not about
the requirements,” Koehler said.
“We’ve had a lot of input ﬁom stu-
dents already.”

Koehler said that another way
students can make a difference in
their University is by joining under-
graduate research groups. He said
Pitt’s commitment to research has
madeitagoodtimeforunderg1adu-
atestogetinonthecuttingedgeof
technology in many dilferent areas.

These things arejust a few of
the ways to gain a sense of identity
and community on campus. There
are many more ways to play the Pitt
game and come out a winner.

DalMolin said students only
have to think about what they want,
and go for it.

“People say Pitt is intimidating
and it reduces people to numbers,
buttostopthatastudenthastodo
something. The only person that’s a
number is die one who sits there
complaining without doing any-
thing. If you do that, then you have
to live with it.”

Gerry Klayrnen, chair of the
studentallocations committee, said
getting involved in as many groups
as possible is the best way students
can get involved in campus issues.

"Ihat’s the way to start,” he
said “I don’t know why people have
such negative attitudes about this
place. To me, Pitt is like a Utopian
there’s just so much to get involved
in.

“To be SllCOCSSf|.ll, you just have
to work hard and play hard.”

Odd groups and politics span spectrum of student society

 

Want to become a druid? How about a
Trekkie or a clown?

You can do all three and then some at
Pitt. A
Among the typical fratemities, sororities
and political organizations on campus, there
are many small, interesting and sometimes
unusual groups that often go unnoticed.

But of them all, the Pitt druids appear to
be the most enigmatic. In fact, the group is so
secretive even their advisor, biology profes-
sor Douglas Chew, doesn’t know what they
do or what they are about.

“I only met ﬂie four [officers] of the
club, and they seem normal, but they’re very
secretive,” he said. “I don’t know whether
they’re religious or social or what they are. I
wish I did I get a couple calls a month about
them”

While the druids are one of the more
mysterious, they’re certainly not the only
unusual group a student can join.

For those who can’t stop clowning
around, the Campus Fools is an opportunity
to practice the ﬁne arts of juggling and jok-
ing.Thegroupalsolists“gravityde ' ”as
one of its weekly events.

Or you can live long and prosper with
the Trekker’s Guild at Oakland, a group ded-

I icated to science ﬁction role playing and Star

Trek conventions. All you have to do is ﬁll
out a guild membership form and let the
group’s “captain” welcome you aboard.

The more aggressive student, however,
could join the Panther Pistol and Riﬂe Club,
the Shotokan Karate Club or the Society of
the Scabbard and Blade, an organization pro-
moting military education.

For the more laid—back student, there is
H.E.M.P., Help End Marijuana Prohibition.
However, the group does require members to
maintain a “satisfactory academic standing.”

Details about these and other student
organizations can be found at the Student
Organization Resource Center by calling
624-7116, or by attending the Activities Fair
in Forbes Quad on August 26.

Representatives from each group on
campus will greet newcomers at the fair
between 4 and 6 pm.

In the meantime, here are some of the
less unusual, but equally rewarding groups
you can ﬁnd on campus.

0 Student Government Board

Thisisthegrouptlratwatchesoutfor
students’ interests and voices those concerns
to Pitt’s 

There are nine committees a student can
join, including the allocations committee,
which doles out activity funding to the rest of
Pitt’s student organizations.

The president and members of the SGB
are selected through an election process, but

«work their way up through the other nine

committees.

Call President Justin DalMolin at 648-
7970 to ﬁnd out how you can become
involved

- Black Action Society

Unifying Pitt’s black community is the
goal of this organization, which tries to edu-
cate the campus about social issues from the
black perspective.

Throughout the year, BAS holds fashion
shows, talent shows and during Black
History Month, it holds special meetings and
celebrations.

President Aisha Anderson said the soci-
ety will try to start a collegiate chapter ofthe
National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People this year. For information on
how to take part, callAnderson at 648-7880.

- College Republicans or University
Democrats

The only thing these groups have in
common is they are always mentioned
together. Whether you see things from a right

or left perspective, these two groups have a 
place for you to take part in local campaigns 
and meet area politicians at weekly meetings.  .

Conservatives, call 648-7830.
Liberals, call 624-7204.
- Campus Women’s Organization

Women’s issues are the focus of this .

organization, which holds weekly meetings
and has hosted speakers like Denise Brown, J

sister of the slain Nicole Brown-Simpson, 
and others who speak out against sexual 

harassment and abuse.

Members of the group also escort 
women to and ﬁom area abortion clinics on lg
Saturdays throughout the year, and take part 
in the Take Back the Night March in spring.  ‘

For more information, call 624-6485.

- Interfratemity Council and

Panhellenic Association

The IFC and Panhel govern the fraterm'— 
ties and sororities, respectively, on campus 
and can assist those interested in ﬁnding the  '

group that best suits them.

The two groups sponsor dance 
marathons, Greek Week and blood drives 
throughout the year. Individual fraterm'ties J
and sororities hold parties and events at their lg‘

Get textbooks for tree!

 

Etlltor-In-clrlet

Buying books can be the most costly part of
starting a new school year, but one Pitt librarmn
says students aren’t taking advantage of the many
ways to get books for free.

’ Not only can students ﬁnd books at Pitt
libraries, they can also get them at the Carnegie
and libraries at other area universities, said Pitt
circulation supervisor Audrey Sites.

She said students should ﬁrst check with the
Hillman reserve desk to see if their professor put
any of the texts on reserve.

“Some of the professors think about the peo-
ple who can’t afford them,” she said.

libraries because they automatically assume th-I
library won’t have what they are looking for.

“Most don’t think about [libraries], the
don’t think that we have ten copies of Th
Tempest  but we do,” she said. “They don’t real
ize that a validated Pitt ID can get them book
from CMU, Chatharn, Duquesne or Carlov
libraries.”

But it can.

Sites said students from any other Pittsburgl
university can borrow books from other area uni
versity libraries. Books can also be requester
from Carnegie library branches and Pitt brancl
campuses, she said.

So if you can’t ﬁnd that $80 textbook ii

web page at www.library.pitt.edu

The area’s/greatest untapped resource is th _.
Carnegie Library, according to Mark Mistretta, :
Point Park College student who registers inev
members at the library.

“Most people signing up for new cards an
students this time of year, because the schoo
libraries are pretty bare,” he said. “Just about any
thing you want is here. People even donate thei
old textbooks.”

Mistretta said the only thing you won’t ﬁnt
in the Carnegie is pornography. “Some people an
disappointed about that, but you can’t please
everyone,” he said

_ To get a Carnegie card, a student need
photo ID and proof of residency.

“You need aniID and something like a lease
or a light bill — anything typewritten and semi
oﬁicial,” he said. “[Then] you can take out up tt
ﬁve CDs, ﬁve videos and 20 books at once.”

Since books are bought at high prices ant
rarely go for halftheir value when sold back at tht
end of the semester, the best way to save money
is to only buy books you know you’ll keep.

A Pitt News study last January showed the
best value for books was found at the privately
owned Campus Bookstore on Forbes Avenut
Across from Giant Eagle.

The store sells mostly used textbooks, bu
doesn’t carry as many as does the Pitt-owner
University Bookstore near Towers.

any books at all.

New caterer
wants cafeterias
more like ”home"

IIIIIIIIIIV Brezniean
____:8JlaIl:JlIuzIL____
The rm News

Pitt’s dining halls may seem a little
more like home this year.

Sodexho Services Inc., Pitt’s new cater-
er, wants students to submit their favorite
recipes.

The dinners that mom used to make
could turn up on the cafeteria line as long as
the food tastes and looks good when made in
the vast quantities necessary to feed an entire
dormitory, said Sodexho sales executive
Keith Polizzano.

And to make lunch breaks easier for stu-
dents with heavy class loads, Dining Dollars
will be accepted in ﬂre Cathedral of Learning
food court this year, according to Betsy
Sallade—Farina, Pitt’s director of food ser-
vices.

Aside from convenience, Polizzano
said Sodexho is making customer service its
major selling point. Marriott, the former
caterer, was criticized by those who said the
company was unfazed by the questions or
concerns of students.

“If customers feel they don’t want to
come up to you because you’re going to bite
their head oif, then right there you’Ve lost
communication,” said Polizzano.

He said communication is the only way
to keep the customer satisﬁed.

Sodexho may also start a ‘best manners
class” in the spring to teach students not to
slurp their soup and the diﬂ’erence between a
salad fork and a dinner fork.

Polizzano said the manners class has
been popular at other universities serviced
by Sodexho.

“A lot of students haven’t had any for-
mal training in dining,” he said. “And a lot

Campus police
say crime

rate falling
thanks to
alert students

____ 

Kevin Cecil: shot and paralyzed on
Fifth Avenue while walking a friend
home.

David Orsbom: beaten by a street
gang on the steps of Towers while
dozens of students watched and did noth-
mg.

A student claims she was raped by
fratemity members during a party in
1995.

While students are often the victims
of crime on campus, Pitt Police Deputy
Chief Gary Moses says they are actually
beginning to play a role in keeping the
area safe.

He credits Oakland’s 9 percent drop
in crime since 1995 to students who are
becoming more aware of the dangers on
an urban campus. He said they are now
more cautious and likely to alert police
when they see suspicious individuals or
incidents.

“Students are becoming more com-
fortable calling the Pitt Police, and when
that happens we see a rise in calls and a
decrease in crime,” he said.

Moses said Pitt Police received
38,000 calls in 1.996 —— 8,000 more than
in 1995. He said those calls are not only
leading them to criminals, they are help-
ing police prevent criminal activity.

“Someone might see something sus-
picious and think, ‘Well, I don’t know if
I want to bother the police.’ But when
you become a presence on campus, and
tell people, ‘We want to be bothered. We
want to be called,’ then that person is
much more likely to call the police,”
Moses said.

Police are trying to become more of
a presence on campus through orienta-
tion programs and meetings with student
groups and professors, he said.

Aside from becoming familiar with
the authorities, Pitt Police Officer Curtis
Smith said students should get acquaint-
ed with their environment both demo-
graphically and culturally, so they know
to avoid potentially dangerous areas like
the Hill District and the nether regions of
South Oakland.

“Simply adding police officers does
not decrease the number of crimes on
campus; students being aware of their
surroundings does,” said Smith, who is

 

Monday, August 25, I997 ' 'I'I-IE PITT NEWS I I

also a self—defense instructor.

Smith encourages new students to
ﬁnd out about campus safety from their
resident assistants, who are most likely
upperclassmen with at least a year’s
worth of their own experience on . the
streets of Pittsburgh.

Smith warns against handing money
out to panhandlers. “Never give direct
exposure that you have money,” he said.
“Desperate people do desperate things.”

The best way to get to keep them
back is to make eye Contact and say “no”
in a firm, loud voice because making eye
contact intirnidates them and shows you
are sure about yourself, he said.

If anyone starts following you on the
street, Smith says the best course of
action is to run to one of the blue light
phones and call the police.

Pitt Police report that the most com-
mon campus crime is theft. Moses said
many thefts can be avoided by locking
your door and watching out for personal
articles.

Do not leave your coat unattended at
parties, and wear an old one just to be
sure, he said. '

Smith suggests that students who
have combination mailboxes leave their
keys and ID card in them when they go
out to a party. That way, if their wallet or
coat is stolen, they can still get into their
dorm or apartment.

Drugs and alcohol are also responsi-
ble for many of the crimes on campus, he
said. Pitt Crime Statistics reported that
officers made 57 arrests for illegal drugs
throughout 1995 and 1996.

“Alcohol is directly related to the
amount of assault, disorderly conduct
and domestic crimes reported,” Moses
said, adding that a drunken euphoria can
cause people to let down their defenses
and become vulnerable to criminals.

According to Moses, the Pitt Police
have “zero tolerance” for drugs and alco-
hol. Keep that beer in thebar and don’t
buy any booze for your underage friends.
Pitt Police are authorized to arrest anyone
found drinking in public or providing
alcohol to anyone under 21 years old.

Moses said women students need to
be particularly alert in order to avoid sex-
ual assaults. He said there were ﬁve
reported rapes between 1993 and 1995,
but in that time there were 63 offenses of
a sexual nature. _

Mary Koch Ruiz, who counsels vic-
tims of rape on campus, said women
should always attend parties in groups.

“I tell them not to leave the party
unless their other friends know they are
leaving. That way no one is ever strand-
ed in a dangerous situation,” Ruiz said.

Smith warns never to let attraction
get in the way of safety.

“It is human instinct for both men
and women to want to be close to one
another, but don’t disarm your basic
internal instincts that keep you safe,”
Smith said.

morn Mat 10

When you say “no,” you must also
show “no,” he said. If you are at a party
and someone starts making uncomfort-
able advances, ‘step away and create dis-
tance, Smithusaid.

. If such a person persists, Ruiz
advised calling to a friend in order to
draw attention to the situation, and leav-
ing the premises as soon as possible.

To prgtect themselves, Moses said
women should also get to know the per-
son well in a group before going any-
where secluded.

Though there have not been any
reported instances of date rape drugs
being used on campus, Moses and Ruiz

advise people to pour their own drinks to 1

be on the safe side.

Bargain road

  

trips can

you out of Oakland cheap

 

There’s one thing many students are
eager to do once they get to Oakland -— get
back out.

Here are some ways to save a little pock-

et change while going on a road trip or just ‘

taking your dirty laundry home to your par-
ents’ house for a wash. %

If you’re just traveling P
around the city, remember: .
from Oakland, cab fares are .
around $6 to downtown or
Squirrel Hill. Learn to use the .
city’s public transportation sys— S
tem. The same trip could cost you less than $1
on a city bus.

Schedules for all the buses running out of
Oaldand are available in the lobby of the
Wﬂliarn Pitt Union," or you can call Port
Authority Transit at 442-2000.

. Students can buy discount bus passes in
the Oﬁice of Parking and Transportation in
204 Brackenridge Hall. All you need is a

p valid Pitt ID and $39.

A Pitt ID can also get you a free ride into
Squirrel *Hill or Shadyside on PAT ’s “U4
Zone.” Pitt and PAT teamed up to start this
line last year so students living in those areas
would have a ride home.

But all students can take advantage of the
“U-Zone,” whether they just want to shop in
Shadyside or catch dimer and a movie in
Squirrel Hill.

On Saturdays, if you’re planning to visit
some of the suburban malls, or do a lot of
neighborhood hopping, a $3 all-day pass will
take you anywhere PA'I‘ buses go. It’s the best
value PAT otfers for tickets, and a good way
to see some of the sunounding towns.

Students can get to concerts, sporting
and festivals downtown by bus for just 50
cents’ on weekends. That’s the cost to ride
downtown buses after 7 p.m. on Saturday and
Sunday if (again) you have a valid Pitt ID.

The very ambitious can haul themselves
ortheirdirtylaundry anywhere inthecountry
by Greyhound bus from the depot at 11th
Street and Liberty Avenue, downtown.

 
  
    

Students can get tickets for $59 one-way
and $118 round trip ifthe they are purchased
21 days in advance, according to Greyhound
sales representative Dennis Hamill. He said
smaller discounts are available at $79 one-
way and $158 round trip if the tickets are
bought two weeks in advance.

Contact Greyhound for details at 1-800-
231-2222. ‘

If you’re looking to get a

little farther away from Pitt, PAT
 and USAirways are making it
 easier than ever to ﬂy that dirty
5 laundry home for a wash.
 You can catch PAT’s 28X
 Flyer to the Pittsburgh
International Airport for only $1.95 — the
same trip will cost you about $35 by taxi. The
shuttle stops in front of the Cathedral of
Learning several times a day, and regular
schedules can be found in the Union.

USAirways has a program called E-
savers, that can help you ﬁnd the cheap ﬂights
to almost any major U.S. city.

E-savers are lists of discount ﬂights des-
ignated by USAirways each week and sent to
you through e—mail. When you sign up, you
choose the cities you’d like to visit, and they
tell you when discount trips are available.

To sign . up, visit the
USAirways web site
(www.usairways.com), and give them your
e-mail address and choose up to ﬁve cities
you’d like to visit. '

Every Wednesday, USAirways will send
you e-mail detailing any specials they have
from those cities. Most regional tickets are
between $79 to $89 round trip. Tickets must
be reserved over the phone with a credit card

Though it gets you cheap ﬂights, there
are two major drawbacks to this plan. First,
these prices can only be used for ﬂights
departing the Saturday of the week the e-mail
is sent, and the return trip must be that fol-
lowing Sunday, Monday or Tuesday. That
doesn’t leave much time for planning.

Also, the person who buys the ticket
must be the person who uses it Otherwise,

card being used is not stolen.

Pitt spokesman Ken Service shows off a renovated living room in a Sutherland suite

that will house three students. Six other students live in three other adjoining rooms.

Housing office scrambles to
find shelter for 200+ students

______1aIreJ11nrner______

The ﬁve—year-old dormitory beside
Pitt’s stadium was once known as “Hotel
Sutherlan .”

Since Pitt is squeezing more than 832
into a building made for 624, one angry stu-
dent says it’s more like a can of sardines.

PitI’s housing oﬂice began converting
suite living rooms in Sutherland and some
lounges in Towers into bedrooms after the
University accepted more requests for cam-
pus housing than the dorms could hold

Pitt is converting living rooms in more
than 60 Sutherland suites into two- or three-
person bedrooms to squeeze an extra 200
residents into Sutherland Hall.

It amounts to almost nine people living
in many of the suites: two people in each of
thethreebedroornsandthreeintheliving
room.

Those who requested suites last year
complain that they are losing their living
rooms. The students being crarmned into
those living rooms in twos and threes say the
area is far too close for comfort.

“They turned one of the most luxurious
dorms into a sardine can,” said Bryan Shipp,
a Pitt student and Sutherland resident. Shipp
will live in one of the original bedrooms in a
converted suite.

“Some rooms have eight people to one
bath. My own room is now nine people to
two baths, [which is] up ﬁom six people. All
of this is entered into by one door.”

Shipp, like many students residing in
Sutherland this fall, was only notiﬁed Friday
that up to three people will be taking up res-
idence in his living room. He said this
severely inconvenienced one of his room-
mates who was on his way from Virginia
that day with a couch for the living room that
no longer exists.

'\r}M§

booking occurred when the housing oﬂice
extended the room—request deadline from
the beginning of May until June.

The work was forced to a stop when
Pittsburgh housing authorities discovered
Pitt did not have the necessary permits to
renovate the rooms. ‘

‘That was kind of a paperwork snafu
where work started without the permits,”
said Service. “The permits we needareallin
place now. Also, there have been adjust-
ments to the price to reﬂect each situation.”

Despite the price reduction, many par-
ents and students are upset over the living
arrangements they are forced to comply
with.

Though Shipp is saving $134 on the
cost of his room, he said he was still upset
about he changes. He said he would like to
move out, but can’t ﬁnd anywhere else to
live.

“They offered me a chance to get out of
the contract, but most leases are already
occupied unless I want to live on the ﬂoor of
somebody’s bathroom deep into South
Oakland,” said Shipp.

But Service said these problems are
becoming more and more common at other
universities.

“I’ve heard horror stories of students
living in a study lounge. Our freshman class
is the largest in the history of this institution,
but our ﬁrst priority is to reduce the overﬂow
of students,” he said. “We will be moving
people out of the renovated rooms as soon as
other openings arise.”

He added that the Sutherland suites will
get their living rooms back once the over-
crowding problem is solved.

To alleviate these problems in the
future, Service said Pitt is still planning to
build a new residence hall within ﬁve years.
The new dorm may be built on the parking
lot where Burger King once stood on Fifth

How to  
succeed in
college classes

Welcome back‘ to school! We hope
everyone has had a good summer and will
have a great school year. So, in an effort to
help save the world, here are a few sug-
gestions for having a good year and suc-
ceeding in college. ‘

There may be nothing more annoying
when it comes to classes than having a
boring one. This is especially true in one’s
junior and senior years. The end is in
sight, but you have to wade through a real-
ly tedious class before you can move on.

Be careful in picking your classes.
Don’t worry about course descriptions
because they’re frequently inaccurate
guesses written by the departments and
not the teachers.

Whenever possible, go talk to the pro-
fessors before you register for their class-
es. Make sure that the professor seems

» interesting and ﬁnd out what you really

will do in her class. You have about a 90
percent chance of ﬁnding that it’s different
than the course description says or makes
it seem. You’ll also find out if the course
is suitable for your interests and abilities
by asking questions and getting answers
—— something course descriptions don’t
offer.

And because boring classes never
seem so bad in retrospect as they do when
you’ re looking ahead to a semester of tor-
ture, try to get them out of the way as soon
as possible. Fulfill your skills and general
education requirements as soon as possi-
ble. '

If you’ve already decided on a major,
something you are really interested in, it
will be much more enjoyable to take those
classes when you’re about to graduate
than trying to fulﬁll a bunch of require-

C ments you really don’t care about.

And if you haven’t decided on a
major, taking a lot of different courses in
your first few semesters may help you
ﬁnd your destined way.

But, if you are set on graduate study
and are completely uninterested in some
things, then, you might want to hide a
requirement or two in your last semester
should you have no intention of getting
anything better than a D in them..The
barely—passing grade won’t affect you too
badly then, since you will have sent your
applications and transcripts out already,
and no one will get to see that last semes-
ter’s grades before they’ve already decid-
ed whether to accept you to their schools.

You’ll do much better in college if
you take classes that interest you, and
you’ll do much better in the job market,

. too. Where you went to school is impor-

tant, but not so much as what you did
there. Remember: As from Pitt beat Ds
from Harvard!

The Pill News: your guide  

The Pill News

From poker to blackjack to bas-
ketball to “Candyland”, any game
could be a metaphor for the time we
spend between the cradle and the
grave.

That’s because the way to live a
good life is the same way to win
any game you play: Be happy.
That’s easier than it sounds, of
course. But if there were nochal-
lenge, there would be no game.

To “win” you have to under-
stand the world you live in. You
have to know how it works. I sup-
pose a good newspaper is like a
player’s handbook then —- a guide
to what is going on

cellor, the provost and the Board of
Trustees are only a small part of
what really makes this place tick.

We covered important topics,

_ but the key to any news story is the
people involved. How are they
affected? How are you affected? I
hope that each article in The Pitt
News explains those things and not
only tells the reader what is hap-
pening, but also explains how that
news event fits into the grand
scheme of things.

When you’re on campus, take a
look at the people around you. The
only thing they have in common
with each other is how different
they are. Each of them thinks in a

. different way. Each one — from the

chancellor to the kid in front of the
Beehive with the bright green
crew-cut — wants something dif-
ferent. -

They are all playing their game
in a different way.

It’s easy to do that in
such an impersonal
place. I don’t think people know
what to look for.

It’s the job of The Pitt News to
unveil those things. A good news-
paper reveals how a culture in any
given city works — like I said, it’s
a player’s handbook. A good col-
lege paper does the same for its
campus.

Last year, The Pitt News tried to
shed light on the inner workings of
Pitt’s administration. But the chan-

hope the news coverage
in this paper begins to show how
the campus dynamic works.

College can thrust a student
into endless and inescapable pres-
sures. Sex, test cramming, drugs,
depression and drinking are some
aspects of student life that too often
go overlooked. That will change
this year. ' -

FAS dean says: Take the
initiative in educating yourself

Pmn
llornrrn

Earlier this summer, I responded to the
invitation of one of our biological sciences
professors to visit his laboratory. He did not
want to show me his most recent research
results or to demonstrate his latest piece of
equipment; he wanted me to meet the group
of undergraduate students working in his
laboratory. “The best group I have ever
had,” he called them.

The students spanned the range from
having just completed the freshman year to
going into the senior year. They were leam-
ing by working right alongside the profes-
sor, his graduate students and a post-doctor-
al researcher. ‘

Each student was responsible for some
of the routine tasks that were required to
keep the laboratory going for all who
worked there. But, in addition, each was
pursuing an individual research project suit-
ably guided and matched to his or her level
of experience.

The two hours I spent listening as these
knowledgeable and enthusiastic students
told me about their projects were an excel-
lent illustration of the fact that a great deal of
the teaching and learning at the University
of Pittsburgh takes place outside the class-
room.

The investment this University makes
in its research-active faculty not only bene-

ﬁts the professors and their graduate stu-
dents, but also creates special learning
opportunities for our undergraduate stu-
dents. It was such an experience as an under-
graduate that inﬂuenced me to study
physics, and I know from talking with a
large number of faculty members over the
years that many of them attribute their career
choice to an interaction with a particular
mentor during their undergraduate studies.
Although the experimental sciences

quite natmally provide many such opportu- -

nities (sometimes the student can even earn
some money in addition to leaming a lot),
they are not the only setting for such facul-
ty-student interactions. ’

It is the rare exception that a faculty
member engaged in research could not use
some help —— checking references, helping
at an archaeological dig, conducting sur-
veys, collecting and analyzing data, staging
a play or preparing an art exhibit. (Students
with computer skills can be especially help-
ful to a faculty member who is not so well-
versedintheusesofaPC.)

How do you ﬁnd out about such oppor- _

tunities? In some instances, a faculty mem-
ber will approach you, but if not, you have
to take the initiative! Have you taken a
course from a faculty member that really
awakened you interest in  ﬁeld? Then
approach that professor directly or ask your
departmental advisor. You will be surprised

how openly faculty members respond to a
student who shows an interest in their ﬁeld.
More than 150 CAS students participated in
a research project with a faculty member last
fall tenn.

And keep in mind that such learning
experiences are not limited to the campus.

For many years, Pitt has had informal
arrangements with many businesses in
Pittsburgh and even a few other cities for
student internships. Our urban location pro-
vides a diverse mix of professional settings.
Each semester, about 100 CAS students do
such an internship, and we are working hard
to increase that number substantially.

to experience what it is like when you trans-
late your classroorn/book learning into the
world of work. Whether you get turned on
or off by the experience, you will have
learned a valuable lesson. Students who can
show internships on their resumes also ﬁnd
that they are valued by potential employers
or graduate school adrnission’s committees.

How do you ﬁnd out about such oppor-
tunities? Again, you have to take the initia-
tive. Contact the CAS Internship
Coordinators (Sue Harkins or Connie Way)
in Thackeray Hall or your departmental
advisor. VVrth help from these individuals,
some students with very particular intem—
ship interests have actually been able to cre-

ate their own opportunities. We are also try-
ing to expand this network by involving Pitt
alumni.

I should mention two other avenues that
are available to undergraduate students for
gaining valuable experience outside the
classroom: study abroad and service as an
undergraduate teaching assistant Pitt offers
a wide range of academic programs in for-
eign countries, including two 100—day
Semester at Sea voyages around the world
each year that are guaranteed to expand your
horizon.

And since teaching is well known to be
one of the‘ best ways of learning, undergrad-
uate teaching assistants are sure to get as
much out of such an assignment as the stu-
dents whom they help.

So, whether you are just arriving as a
freshman or transfer student or returning as
an upperclassman, take my advice: Do not
treat your undergraduate years as a passive
learning experience. You would miss out on
a great opportunity.

What you get out of these years

depends in large measure on what you invest .

in them, in your courses as well as outside
the classroom. As a research university in an
urban setting, the University of Pittsburgh
oﬂ°ers you a wide range of choices, both on-
carnpus and olf, to discover your interests
and develop your talents.
Seize the opportunity!

Let me say that I will be debating why
a male college student should join or con-
sider joining a fraternity. But this piece is not
commenting on all Greeks, because I know
as much about being in a sorority as the
WWF knows about real wrestling.

Everyone has the same preconceived
notions about fraternities before attending
college. They party, they drink and they vic-
tirnize women. National Lampoons’ movie
Animal House can be thanked for stereotyp-
ing fraternities for a generation or more. In
Animal House, a member sleeps with a 15-
year—old, John Belushi chugs a bottle of Jack

Daniels and the house gets kicked oif cam-
pus for a number of indecent acts, including
the pre-meditated debacle of the town’s

Is this a realistic View of fraternity life?
Well, it’s a movie, so it must be, right?
That’s what I thought in high school.

Yes, it is true that social fraternities do
have social events (parties) and most of
them involve the use of alcohol (the cheap-
est beer money can buy). And at these
events, there are women present and some-
times a guy and a girl will have a physical,
sexual experience (a hook—up). But, this is
no different from what happens at a bar, club
or house party.

Crazy and bizarre things will happen in

a house ﬁlled with 20 or more guys whether
it is a fraternity house, rugby house or just a
group of buds living together. It’s not the fra-
ternity, so much as it is that putting a num-
ber of males together in the same social set-
ting will promote testosterone-driven activi-
ties. I
Do not misunderstand me. I am not
implying that being in a fraternity and being
on a team of some sort are in anyway the
same. I’ve been on both, and they are quite
different

I played high school football, and I
made a lot of good, close friends, but it isn’t
the same. There is something special and
unique about being part of a brotherhood
that is hard to explain in words because it’s

a real feeling. Of course, I can only speak
from personal experience and not about fra-
ternities as a whole. Every house is dilferent
with its own rituals and traditions.

For me, brotherhood is a family of indi-
viduals that I can unconditionally trust.
They bask with me in my successes and
pick me up in my times of
despair. It’s similar to that
warm-fuzzy feeling you
get from a sentimental
moment. The feeling that kind of makes you
all numb for a while like staring into a
1over’s eyes or when you watch a dear
friend walk down the aisle. T

This may sound cheesy, and as I write
this I kind of feel the same, but it’s the truth.
It is an unbelievable feeling to know that
there are 30 or so people on this earth that
you can go to with any problem, whether it
be something simple as “my girlfriend is
pissingmeoﬁ” oras serious as death.

One of my best friends said it best:
"There’s no better feeling than knowing
you’re 40 deep (in friends) at all times.
Because you can never have enough.”

A common misconception I worried
about before pledging was that my grades
would suffer. I scored a 2.93 while pledging,
which wasn’t spectacular, but for a first
semester GPA it’s decent. Especially when
you consider last spring’s freshrnen-male
average was a paltry 1.75.

‘Youaneencouragedtostudyandtake
school work seriously. This trend is evident
‘when looking at the statistics. Stats are bor-
ing, but they make a point. The fraternity
average last spring was a 2.73, and the all-
male average was a 2.58.

And this wasn’t a ﬂuke. The average
fraternity member has gotten better grades
than the average male for at least the past
ﬁve years. Having fun in college and per-
forming well in school can go hand-' -hand.

The one cliche that a non-Greek will
spoutoutagainstjoiningafratemityisthat
they “don’t have to buy their friends”.
Fraternities do collect a dollar amount from
each brother. The concept that people don’t
understand is that this money is formed into
abudgettorunthefraternity.ThemoneyI
pay in member fees each year doesn’t go to
any one pason; it goes to the fraternity.
When new members get they don’t
“pay” the established brothers any money.
The majority of the money is spent on social
events, house improvement and insurance.

Ihaveleamedagreatdealﬁombeing
an active member. My public speaking,
organizational and people skills are much
improved due to fraternity activities.

If you join a national fraternity, which
includes every social fraternity at Pitt, you
will instantly become brothers with thou-
sands of members who are willing to help
youinanywaytheycan.Thiscanonlyhelp
in the dreaded post-college job search.

A brother will always help another
brother.

Fraternities: To join or not to join,
that is the question.

You see, as much as one person will
tell you, “Deﬁnitely. You should,” and
another will tell you to “stay away at all

costs,” it is simply not a

black and white issue.

There are beneﬁts and

‘ detriments to fraternity

life. I will explain the detrimental side of

the conﬂict. However, I will preface all

of this by stating that I myself was a

member of a fraternity for three years,

and the experience certainly has not
ruined my life.

The fact is, a fraternity (or sorority

for that matter‘ has a great deal to offer

the average person. As a young fresh-

 

man lost in the maelstrom of academics.

and social life, a fraternity can seem like
a Rock of Gibraltar. Quite suddenly, one
makes the metamorphosis from Mr.
Alone in a cruel, uncaring world to Mr.
Hey, I’ve got so many friends
(Brothers!) I can hang 24-7.

Not only that, but you’ll be bom-
barded with the true facts that men in
fraternities have a higher average QPA
than non—fraternity members, a lower
drop-out rate and the astounding fact
that something like three—fourths of U.S.
presidents were fraternity boys! Sounds
like the recipe for becoming a successful
man.
So, with all the facts, you may well
be wondering how I can make a case
against fraternities. The truth is, I would-
n’t dare try. There’s something out there
for everyone, and you may be the type of
person who will happily wear your
Greek letters to your own funeral some
day. (Hopefully, that will be many
decades from now.)

But there is an alternative that I
recommend highly: the independent
route. I

Even the word “independent” has a
wonderful feel to it. Being an indepen-

dent is harder in many ways. It means '

you will not belong to the “in-group”.

and find your own

In a fraternity, one
has the tendency to do
stupid things because
everyone is doing it. As
an independent, YOU
pick and choose the stu-

you will become a much better person

same society tends to reward these fol-
lowers with success (as they deﬁne it)
and money.

Do all independents become social-

Again, of course not. But being indepen-
dent is an incredible way to see the
diversity of what surrounds you at a
major university, incorporate it into your
daily life and become a better person.

All of this, because you open your-
self up to the possibility of being differ-

it. Call Opinions Editor Kris Kissel
at 648-7984.

We call this our orientation
issue, but every edition of a newspa-
per is, in some way, an orientation
issue. This edition covers a broad
range of topics that we will examine
in more detail during the months
ahead. Remember the people we’ve
featured in this issue. They’ll make
decisions every day that affect your
life.

By the way 

Besides our event coverage,
here are some other ways the news-
paper is changing.

- Impulse magazine

We will begin publishing

'I'I-IE PITT NEWS

mm FIG! 22

Impulse, an arts and entertainment
magazine, every Friday starting on
September 5. It will be distributed
to colleges throughout the city.

Aside from current movie, the-
ater and music reviews, this maga-
zine will also take a creative look at
issues that interest college students
throughout the area. The culture
shock felt by exchange students and
the best ways to find a date on a
strange campus are just two of the
feature stories appearing in Impulse
in the coming months.

The magazine will also feature
fiction, poetry and art from students
around the city. If you’ve got some-
thing you’d like to submit, send it to

Impulse Editor Stephen H. Segal.
You can contact him at 648-7982.

0 T.V. Listings

For your convenience, we will
run a schedule of television pro-
grams in the back pages of the paper
each day. The listing will be for that
night’s prime time programming.

Impulse will carry Friday’s list-
ings and a highlight of the weekends
programs. If the popularity of the
listings is sufficient, we may expand
them to cover Saturday and Sunday
night schedules too.

0 The Weekly World Pitt News

One thing this newspaper needs
is a little more of a sense of humor.

I’m sure you’ve seen The Weekly

A great photo in the Panther Prints yearbook, that is. On Tuesday, Aug. 26 Panther
Prints will be offering everyone in the Pitt community a chance to take your own
photographs for the 1997-1998 Panther Prints yearbook.

From 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. a camera will be available on the Bigelow Porch of the William
Pitt Union. Come and take a picture — of you, your roommates, your friends, your dog,
your virtual pet, whatever. This is open to all University of Pittsburgh students, faculty,
staff, and alumni. All suitable photos will be included in the yearbook. (There will be a
petty insignificant charge of $1. If you Want a copy of the pic, it can be yours for 85.)

Do you want to make this a year to remember? Join us!

Join Panther Prints, and help compile the one official history of this year at Pitt. There
are several positions available. Give us your creativity to help enrich and preserve the
year at Pit, and discover the rewards for contributing to a prestigious publication. Oh,
and We’ll have some fun along the way!

Student Activities Fair: We will have a table at the Fair at Forbes Quad on Tuesday,

counter in 7-11. It’s the one with the
Loch Ness Monster greeting aliens
with Bill Clinton on the steps of the
White House. We have decided to
do some of our own investigative
reporting in the tradition of that fine
tabloid “news” paper.

It won’t be weekly, or monthly.
In fact, I’m not sure exactly when it
will come out. We have our best
reporters investigating some rather
strange stories already, and they
expect to complete their research
around April — sometime near the
beginning of the month, I think.

They say satire is a lost art.
We’ll see.

So, while we take a closer look
at Pitt’s campus and begin adding a
little levity to our newspaper, I
guess I would advise you to do the
same thing. Have fun, but be smart.
Watch out for temptation so you
never miss it.

College life can be one of the
hardest things you do, or one of the
most carefree times of your life.
Ignore what others do or have done
in the past and be creative.

And remember, Pitt is kind of
like “Jeopardy.” The answers are
here, you just have to ask the right
questions.

chief of The Pitt News.

We must understand the
facts about sexual assault

Iusou

Rape.

This is not a campus issue. It is not a
city or state issue.

It is a people issue.

More precisely, it is not only a female
issue.

I am not here to male—bash. That
would be alienating, rude and oﬁensive.
Men play as large a role as women do in
the prevention of rape, and I would like to
keep it that way.

The two most important factors in
preventing sexual assault are communica-
tion and comprehension. You must let
people know who you are and what you
want. You must understand and accept
what other people are and what they want.

It sounds simple, but even a slight
misconception or ignorance can lead to
sexual assault and rape. (Disclaimer: Each
state has different deﬁnitions that speciﬁ-
cally outline sexually related offenses. I
chose not to include any deﬁnitions from
the Pennsylvania Crime Code in order not
to cause confusion.)

As a P.E.E.R.S. educator for Sexual
Assault Services here at Pitt, I have had
the opportunity to attend intensive training
classes that have prepared me to teach,
discuss and clarify issues involved in sex-
ual assault.

Needless to say, I have learned a lot
for myself.

In addition, I also have become better
at refuting ignorant and shallow remarks
that usually come from people who feel
the need to be obstenant that rape isn’t an
issue, that it’s the woman’s fault, etc.

It should not shock anyone to know
that there are still a large number ofpeo-
ple out there (men and women) who
believe that it’s okay to get drunk and have
sex .

First of all, if a victim decides to press
charges against you, having had sex with
her while she was intoxicated or high
could mean she did not give rational con-
sent, and it was rape.

Second, why would you want to have
sex with a drunk person who doesn’t real-
ly know what he/she is doing?

Third, if that person did not want to
have sex while he/she was sober, there
was probably a reason for it. Lastly, alco-
hol inhibits your decision making abilities,
so even if he/she says yes, and you say
yes, neither answer is reliable.

Drinking is no excuse for doing any-
thing illegal like rape. For example: If you
got really drunk, decided to go for a drive
and ended up running over three people,
do you really think the judge is going to
drop the charges when you say, “But, I
was DRUNK! I didn’t MEAN to kill three
people!” No, not even if the victims were
drunk when they were nmning across the

street. The fact remains, it’s illegal, and
that’s that!

People who think that makes it okay
are usually the same people who think that
anyone in a mini-skirt is “asking for it,”
and that tight clothing means “come get
me.” ’

Here we have a gray area,because
there are those who wear “sexy clothing”
simply because they’re promiscuous and
looking for sex. However, it does not mat-
ter if said person is promiscuous. So what
if he/she has had three partners in the past
week? So what if he/she goes out every
night looking for sex? That does not mean
sex will always be agreed to. It does not
mean that she was looking to have sex
with you.

In reference to the assumption that all
short, low—cut and tight clothing means “I
am ready and willing to have sex,” it’s a
stupid, unintelligent and asinine assump-
tion. Everybody has their own perceptions
of what kinds of clothing are “nice,”
“classy,” “sexy” and “promiscuous”.
Everybody has their own stereotypes of
those people. But what makes you think
that some woman in a mid-thigh, black
mini-skirt wants to be raped?

She doesn’t.

NOBODY asks to be raped,
NOBODY wants to be raped and
NOBODY enjoys being raped.

Other points that seems to come up
quite often from both men and women is
that it is easy for any female to accuse any
male of rape or sexual assault and that it is
unfair to men because in many cases it
boils down to her word against his.

Well, let me defuse this he said/she
said argument right now: Unless you are
being accused yourself, keep your mouth
shut and let the system do its job because
the only two people that know what hap-
pened are the individuals involved. I don’t
care that the perpetrator was a straight A
student and president of the Student
Council. Good grades and dimples are not
a sure sign of innocence.

(Look at all the convicted murderers
and rapists whose neighbors described
them on the 6 o’clock news as “real nice
and generous — never any trouble.” We
are human beings, and we have mastered
the art of deception.)

So, to all those who think men are get-
ting a bad rap —— think again, because no
matter whose “side” you are on, nobody
wins. Remember, it is a combined effort.

To everyone: Be aware, and be care-
ful.

Miami

A new school year has started with
more new faces than new places. The
same old streets of Oakland, Shadyside
and Squirrel Hill have become the
stomping grounds for the geographi-
cally challenged new students.

Yet, even after a few years here,
there are a lot of places the four—year
Oaktowner (cool slang for Pitt student)
neglects to visit. All too often, people
limit their collegiate experience here to
the aforementioned locales, with an
occasional trip to the South Side or

Side. Wander, go out and find your
groove.

Pittsburgh is more of a big town
than a small city, which makes neigh-
borhood adventures all the more perti-
nent to relieving boredom. The great-
est places are stumbled upon by walk-
ing tours of an area. Small shops with
character are cloaked in the shroud of
non-advertisement and depend on
walk—in clientele. There are hundreds
of places that the eyes have never seen.
There’s a cool little diner and five and
dime stores in every neighborhood.

There are city steps that lead to moun-
tains of macadam and train track
meadows. The bridges around town
are gateways to whole other worlds
full of pawn shops, ethnic foods, thrift
stores and free jazz —— real urban life
for the anthropologist in everyone.

Pinball machines and art galleries
are tucked away in neighborhood cor-
ners. The third largest private cemetery
in the nation is under three miles from
campus.

Ask questions, play games.

set in the author’s old neighborhood,
this person went there and found the
places that were described. A book
aptly titled “Mysteries of Pittsburgh”
is set in Oakland; why not try to find
the areas Michael Chabon is describ-
ing?

Not enough people take advantage
of the city’s surroundings. Every
urban setting is a museum unto itself;
art, artifacts and architecture abound.
All that’s needed is the ability to
appreciate the surrounding environ-
ment. A fetish for old school years and
decades gone by can be helpful. By
staying solely in the familiar parts, one
makes one’s world smaller. Explore:
It’s fun, interesting and free.

Where are the ﬂea markets? What
goes on in Panther Hollow? Schenley
Park is only one of 172 city parks,
where are the others? Where are the
permanent residents? What makes
Pittsburgh such a special place that
people want to live out their whole
lives here? Actually, this last one, you
may or may not be able to answer, but
it’s not necessary. A lifetime love
affair with the city isn’t necessary to
cop a feel.

An antiquated aura exists under

_ the urban renewal, and in most places,

this history is more apparent than the
glossy lights and trendy stores of the
new. The early 20th Century writer 0.
Henry stated that there are stories in
everything. In every neighborhood, in
every brick, in every street, life is an
autobiography, so why limit the con-
tent of the college chapters to simply
the college part of town?

An Oaklandic-rooted life is not a
full Pittsburgh experience. Take an
adventure.

Mean Panther aside,
Pitt football gets a
major facelift for the
1997 season

New uniforms. New
coach. A “new attitude”
complete with media hype
and a growling cat on
everybody’s helmet.

But has anything really
changed with the 1997 Pitt
football team?

This summer, the team
pushed trucks around the
Pitt Stadium field, ran the
bleachers carrying cinder
blocks and had their
weight-room repetitions
determined by a roll of the
dice (shoot craps, and you
lift until you can’t lift any-
more).

Yes, you could say that
things have changed. And
the conditioning program
is just the beginning of an
overhaul that includes a
new West Coast Offense, a
new Mad Dog Defense, an
intense blue-and-gold mar-
keting drive and the use of
sledgehammers to knock
down trees at summer
training camp.

“Our philosophy is
come to die, not to sur-
vive,” said Buddy Morris,
Pitt's strength and condi-
tioning coach.

Aside from the blunt-
force lumberjacking,
Morris instituted a number
of other wilderness activi-
ties at Pitt camp in
Johnstown to keep the
injured players busy.

Strangely, the list of
injured players has dwin-
dled, with the prospect of
outward—bound-style
“functional—strength reha-
bilitation” (Morris’s
phrase) keeping Panthers
with bumps and bruises

out on the practice field.

Except for a handful of
foresters, the team prac-
ticed three times a day,
learning the complex
offense brought from Ohio
State by Head Coach Walt
Harris and the schemes
that Defensive
Coordinator Larry Coyer
has developed over three
decades of coaching.

After the healthy play-
ers tested their new sys-
tems in their first scrim-
mage at Johnstown, the
training site was nearly
washed away by rain. The
team broke camp and
headed back to Pittsburgh,
keeping the three-a-day
schedule on the hard turf
of Pitt Stadium.

“This has been a chal-
lenging practice sched-
ule,” said Harris. “We’re a
very enthusiastic and high-
tempo, high-octane coach-
ing sta .”

Harris has had stints as
linebacker coach, sec-
ondary coach and head
coach (compiling a 11-24
record at Pacific
University over three
years), but his specialty is
the offense. Specifically
the West Coast-style
offense, which he brings to
Pitt with the help of
Offensive Coordinator
Steve Mooshegian.

The new scheme
involves quick reads, com-
plex formations, multiple
options and short, quick
passes. Senior quarterback
Pete Gonzalez said that
moving from last year’s

THE PITT NEWS

The Harris
Era begins

Man TWIIISIIIIII
Isslstant Sums Etlltor

On a sticky Friday mom-
ing, the Pitt football team
stands enthralled in an early
practice session during their
second week of preseason
football camp. A serni—huddle
forms in the center of the
ﬁeld, surrounding a smash-
mouth drill of 3-on-3. During
one exchange, a tandem’s
blocking turns to punches and
a then a body slam.

The smallish head coach,
Walt Harris, rushes into the
fray, instantly throwing one of
the participants out of the
rumble by the seat of his pants
and snapping hold of the other
by clamping onto his face
mask.

“I’m not laid back on the
ﬁeld. I am focused and dedi-
cated. We have so much to do
and don’t have time to mess
around,” Hanis said later.

Last December, Pitt intro-
duced its 33rd football coach.
Harris replaced the ineffective
John Majors and began the
second round of changes in

the athletic department’s over-
haul following Steve
Pederson’s hiring as athletics
director a month earlier.

At the time, Harris was in
the midst of a Rose Bowl run,
still serving as quarterback
coach at Ohio State. Harris
fulﬁlled his commitment to
the Buckeyes by mastennind-
ing the game—wirming drive.

“I didn’t want to let those
kids down. I had to ﬁnish the
job I started because that’s the
kind of person I am,” he said.

He’s also the kind of per-
son who worked a double
shift while at the Rose Bowl
after being hired by Pitt.

“I worked every night for
free, trying to do the things
that this program needs to
improve.”

Since then, Harris has
taken on an experienced
coaching stalf that shares his
dedication and conviction.

“They are intense, really
intense,” said senior defensive
back John Jenkins. “It’s been
kind of awkward because, on
the ﬁeld, they are your coach-

rules after the rookie’s late-practice scuffle.

es, but olf the ﬁeld, they care
about how you are doing -
and I’m not used to that. Even
Coach Harris will come over
and ask how you are holding
up.”

Harris and Pederson have
drastically changed the foot-
ball program —— it will have a
“new attitude” for the 1997
season, as advertised at the
logo unveiling earlier this
month.

“We needed a change.
Our football players wanted a
change. That was the ﬁrst

thing they said when meeting
with Steve [Pederson] for the
ﬁrst time,” said Harris.

And Harris knows how to
build a winner. He should —
he’s been a part of the process
twice, at Tennessee and Ohio
State.

This time, though, he will
be more than just a part of the
process.

on myself than I’ve felt. I’m
focused on the job at hand.

Ask freshman running back
Kevan Barlow why he chose to play
his college ball at Pitt, and he’ll give
you a simple, straightforward answer
—— he liked everything.

He liked the campus. He liked the
coaching staff. He liked the scheme.
He liked Walt Harris.

And he’s not alone —— just one of
over a dozen positive—thinking
Panthers that form the first recruiting
class of the “new attitude” era.

Barlow, a Pittsburgh native, could
see signiﬁcant playing time in his
rookie season, thanks to a West Coast-
style offense/ that allows for more than
one tailback in the game at a time.
This could team the freshman with
Billy West or Dwayne Schulters,
senior statesmen that Barlow says
deserve their spots ahead of him on
the depth chart.

here and start,” said the freshman. “I
really want to learn off of [my team-
mates].”

While Offensive Coordinator
Steve Mooshegian said he has no cur-
rent plans to move the 220-pound
Barlow to fullback, the rookie’s power
running could earn him some short-
yardage carries.

Barlow showcased his straight-
ahead style in three-on-three drills at
summer camp; in the drill, three offen-
sive lineman square off against three
defenders, with one running back
attempting to squeeze through to day-
light between the six hulks and the
two sideline-marking cones, placed
about 10 yards apart.

Barlow was barely touched in his
two passes during one such drill. He
had a good explanation.

“I see myself as a power back
[and] a cut back,” he said. “I got
power, speed and all that.”

Panther volleyball team set for another successful season

Matt Towsontl
Assistant Snorts Etlltor

The is supposed to be a new
attitude and work ethic in the Pitt
athletics department. Uniforms are
Vegas gold and dark blue instead of
off-yellow and boring blue. Even
the panther is a little more naughty
looking. But will these changes
have a profound effect on Pitt
teams?

Vo1leyball's head coach, Cindy
Alvear, smiles and says, “that atti-
tude came from our program.
We’ve always tried to push our ath-
letes to do amazing things. We’ve
always worked at the level they are

promoting now.”

Alvear isn’t implying that she
was the mastermind behind the
“new attitude” jingle and the Pitt
sports rejuvenation, she’s only say-
ing that her team has always had a
tireless regiment of practice, school
work and competition. They had a
team GPA of 3.38 last spring, easi-
ly the highest of any Pitt team, and
the squad has averaged 21 wins a
season in the four years Alvear has
been at the helm of the Pitt pro-
gram.

“We make unbelievable sacri-
fices,” said the coach. “When we
talk to people about coming here,
we let them know what will be

expected from them. If they don’t
like it then we tell them to stop
talking to us.”

The team is looking for a
unique athletes who wants to work
harder than other athletes. An ath-
lete who wants to be part of a team
effort that is difficult to find in
other athletic programs around the
country.

“Our philosophy is that we do
things differently to win, because if
we’re doing the same things other
teams are doing, then how will we
beat them? We set high standards
for our team,” said Alvear.

A pre-season goal is to be a top
25 team and to cross the 20—win

elective.

barrier again.

This team is young, with no
seniors and only four juniors. There
are three returning starters. Junior
Jessica Van Der Mallie returns at
outside hitter. The 6—foot-5-inch
Paula Zemrowski brings her huge
arm span and obvious blocking
ability back to the Panthers. Peggy
Meinhart, an All-Big East rookie
selection last year, should start
again at front middle hitter.

“It’s all a big puzzle right now.
Only one upper classmen was a
starter last year,” said Alvear.
“There are going to be some battles
for starting spots.

"There is a lot of parody
already. This group is much more
balanced than last year.”

Last year’s team had two stars
in Jennie Driscoll and Stephanie
Dufresne. Driscoll holds the career
mark for solo blocks and is in the
top 10 in five other categories.
Dufresne was the team setter and is
second all~time in assists for the
Panthers.

“They were our go-to players.
We’ll miss them, but we won’t lose
because they left,” said junior
defensive specialist Kelly Meyers.

Due to the lack of a senior
class, the team has ‘built a solid
chemistry.

“There is less class separation
because there aren’t any seniors.
Everyone is really close and is
stepping it up,” said Meyers.

“Sometimes a senior is put
above a younger player, but when a
freshman is stuffing it back in your
face then it’s a hard to do that,”
said Alvear.

The incoming freshmen class
ﬂaunts two of the nation’s top 50
recruits and one Canadian National
team member.

Lisa Riggle out of Gillette,
Wyoming and Stacy Renick, the
six—footer from Eagen, Minnesota,
made the top 50 list of high school
volleyball players. Ontario native
Marcia Thiesen missed the first
days of training camp because she
was playing for her country in
Cuba.

“We must be doing something
right to get two of the top 50 play-
ers in the country to our program,”
said Alvear. “This could be the best
incoming class ever.”

The recruits, paired with skilled
returning players, could prove for a
volatile season. They are young and
extremely talented, but lack experi-
ence. _

“This is the most physically tal-
ented and youngest team I’ve ever
coached,” said Alvear. “We’ll see
the extremes this year, the wonder-
ful and the embarras_si_ng.T’,,..,.

Monday, August 25, ‘I997

I’m not saying that we are going to do
anything. I didn’t have to promise a cer-
tain record when I took the job.”
Winning this year will be a challenge;
a tough schedule and_ several young play-
ers is hardly a blue print for success.
“They haven’t been trained, physical-
ly, the way they need to be,” said Harris.
“Everyone has to start over.”
Pitt itself has started over as well.
The department now calls itself the
“Pittsburgh Panthers”, and along with the

K new name comes a national marketing

scheme that should produce signiﬁcant
revenue.

Last year, Pitt football didn’t even
make enough to cover its own expenses
-— let alone carry the athletic department
like teams at other schools can do.

“We need to take advantage of what
we have,” said Hanis. “Before now you
could only buy Pitt apparel in the Pitt
bookstores. We weren’t making zilch.

“The problem with this program was
that we had all the great players and
teams, but didn’t put enough back into the
program to keep it strong.”

For years, Pitt was a national power-
house — they made nine straight bowl
appearances between 1975 and 1983, but
they haven’t made one since a win in the
1989 John Hancock Bowl.

“This program was good for so long,
and they didn’t capitalize on their success.
We haven’t grown. I’m in the same office
that Johnny Majors was in in 1973 -
that’s not progress” said Harris.

Recruiting is the key to the success of
any program. To win games, a team needs
players, and to get players, it needs to sell
the school and program.

“It’s all about recruiting. Young peo-
ple are impressed with the impressive.
They buy with their eyes, and that’s who
we are trying to sell to. The first impres-
sion is everything, and to get to our oﬁice
you have to walk through that garage, not
impressive. We need to get better. We
need to change,” said Hanis.

With the Pederson’s aid, Harris says
he’ll get the changes he needs to be able to
recruit from coast to coast.

“We need to recruit nationally,” said
Harris, “and to do that you need some-
thing that will shock and impress kids
besides our coaching staff and the oppor-
tunity to play. We have to build a facility
that shows people that we are dedicated to
athletics.”

Improvements have already been
made.

The walls in Pitt Stadium have been
painted, and a state—of-the—art replay
screen has been installed. Plus, all the start
times have been moved back to 3:30, with
numerous pre-garne activities plarmed.

“I think it’s a great place to watch a
game. The 3:30 start time will bring more
families to the game, which helps bring
more people to Pitt.We’re trying to build a
winning program, not just a winning
team,” said Harris.

 

'I'I-IE PITT NEWS

Pederson experienced a winning pro-
gram at Nebraska and says he understands
what steps must be taken to succeed at
Pitt.

“Right now, there are a myriad of
things that have to be done,” he said.
“We’ve done some stadium improve-
ments, and we are trying to speed things
along. My biggest concern is what the
coaching staff thinks of the facilities. We
are continuously evaluating everything.”

And Harris is conﬁdent that their
overall plan will succeed.

“We can get the players. It’s getting
the players in the right frame of mind that
will make us a good team. This program
has been proven to work; it’s just a matter
of getting it done.”

system to Harris’s is like “going from
a stationwagon to a Cadillac.”

Gonzalez is one of three signal-
callers currently asking Harris for the
keys to the new offense. Redshirt
junior Matt Lytle and redshirt sopho-
more Darnell Dinkins are also in the
running. No announcement had been
made as of press time, but Gonzalez
seems to have a lock on the starting
job.

All three quarterbacks will bene-
fit from Harris’s coaching, which has
helped to shape the careers of
Boomer Esiason, Jeff Blake, Bobby
Hoying and Tony Eason. And while
the eventual starter will need to make
the complex reads called for by the
system, there is a five—point backup

plan that should make things easier in
the early going.

Billy West, Dwayne Schulters,
Hank Poteat, LaFann Williams and
Kevan Barlow are the five points, and
the plan is to run the ball.

Often.

The five tailbacks could all see
time in the new system, taking some
of the burden off the quarterbacks, an
untested receiving corps and a large-
ly untested group of Panther defend-
ers, who also have a new scheme to
learn.

“I would love to run it every
down because it helps our defense,”
said Harris, adding that “the better
[the quarterback] bites into the sys-
tem, the more we’ll mix it up.”

Running or passing, the offense
will only go as far as the offensive
line takes them.

And this year's line may be the
strongest unit on the team, thanks to
three returning seniors and Morris’s
off—season conditioning.

“[Morris is] special to me,’ said
Tom Freeman, the offensive line
coach. “He’s top-notch, and I’ve been
with two other real good [strength
coaches].”

It’s no secret that the talent level
at Pitt is not yet where it needs to be
to challenge for a Big East title,
which makes the focus on condition-
ing all the more important.

Morris’s program is just one of a
number of changes Harris and

Athletics Director Steve Pederson
have brought to the University.

THE PITT NEWS

Monday, August 25, I997

The most visible change, aside

from the sledgehammers, has been’

the new uniforms.

“I think we needed a change,”
Harris said. “Our football players
wanted a change. They hated the
[old] uniforms and the colors.”

Harris was quick to point out that,
prior to the uniform change, it was
next to impossible to find Pitt mer-
chandise in stores anywhere outside
of Oakland. With Adidas and
Champion now in charge of Panther
apparel, that should change, he said.

In terms of the department's rev-
enue, Pitt has lagged behind other
major colleges in recent years.

The merchandising and ticket-
sales campaigns -—— as well as the ulti-
mate goal of facility improvements
and the construction of a new convo-
cation center — are aimed at bringing
in money.

The plan is not only to bring Pitt
back to its 1970s glory (both on the
field and in ticket booth), but keep it
there by investing money back in to
the program — an investment that
past administrators failed to make,
according to Harris.

Understandably, it’s a long, slow
process that involves more than this
season’s football performance. But,
the Panthers’ play this year could
provide a spark for the entire athlet-
ics program.

Harris realizes the pressure his
team is under, but makes no promis-
es.

“The only guarantee I’ll make is
that we’ll play hard,” he said.

Like their coaches, the players
understand they need to make steady,
consistent improvements and then
just let the chips fall where the may.

“I’m not looking for personal
goals,” said West. “I’m looking at a
number of wins.”

“The only goal I have is for us to
get better as a team,” redshirt junior
Chuck Brown said.

Still, the Panthers may need to
get better in a hurry, if they want to
start the season with a win streak.

The storied rivalry between Pitt
and AP preseason first-ranked Penn
State will be reborn when the
Panthers invade Happy Valley on
Sept. 7. The Nittany Lions are sand-
wiched between non—conference foes
Southwestern Louisiana and Houston
on this year’s schedule, with Big East
action slated to start with a home-
coming night game against Miami.

The only interruption of confer-
ence play thereafter takes place Oct.
11, when ex—Pitt assistant coach Bob
Davie and ex—Pitt recruit Ron Powlus
lead Notre Dame into Pitt Stadium.
The game figures to be a sellout, with
fans of both teams sporting similar
blue and gold colors.

The season concludes with the
Backyard Brawl — a Nov. 28 clash
with longtime rival West Virginia.

Monday. August 25. 1997 ‘ms PITT NEWS 43
. _ I‘

Mendenhall has a bit of that as well. A
220-pounder out of Morrisville, Pa.,
Mendenhall rushed for 1,500 yards in
his senior year and could crack the
ever-expanding running back rotation.

New recruits could also sneak into
the wide receiver rotation, which sports
Jake Hoffart as the only returning
starter.

Freshmen Cheo Angel and Ramel
Johnson are not technically new
recruits (Johnson was academically
ineligible last season; Angel enrolled in
January), but should see action in their
first year of eligibility. Terry Murphy, a
transfer from West Los Angeles
College, could also make an immediate
impact.

Mooshegian singled out Jackie
Womack, a junior-college transfer, as
the most impressive of the wideout

recruits, at least when it comes to catch— ’

ing the long pass.

‘ “Jackie Womack probably could be
our fastest receiver,” said the coach,
who admitted that the team was still
searching for a true deep threat.

Womack and his fellow wideouts
fared well at summer camp, partially
due to the inexperienced secondary that
they competed against.

With the transformation of Rashaad
Whitrnill from comerback to receiver
and the movement of E.C. Varoutsos
from comer to linebacker, only three
Panthers return from the 1996 sec-
ondary.

Tray Crayton, a transfer from
Palomar College, is challenging sopho-
more Chiffon Allen for the left corner-
back position. Buffalo—native Kenny
Harris saw action with the second unit
at camp. Mark Ponko and defensive
back-slash-running back Victor Stradler
round out the secondary’s youth move-
ment.

Two other recruits could see some
action in Defensive Coordinator Larry
Coyer’s new Mad Dog scheme.

Jeff McCurley of Enon Valley, Pa.,
performed well with the second unit at
defensive tackle. And Grant Elam, who
starred at quarterback for S.F. Austin
High School in Austin, Texas, will try
his luck at linebacker.

Moving back to the other side of
the ball, nine lettermen return on the
offensive line — the deepest position
on the squad with the exception of tail-
back. The returnees take up nearly the

. entire depth chart at all ﬁve line posi-

tions.

Tom Coury, a 6-3, 335-pounder out
of Tarentum, Pa., looks to challenge the
veterans. Mike Bosnic, a graduate from
nearby Uniontown High, tips the scales
at a measly 265, but already has the
attention of the coaching staff.

“He’s had a chance to play,” said
Harris of Bosnic, who noted that the
often-injured line may not be as deep as
he’d like. “He’s actually in the fray, try-
ing to survive. We think he’s going to

 

be a ﬁne football player.”

Tom Freeman, Pitt’s new offensive
line coach, shares similar feelings. He
sees a bright future for Bosnic, who
could put more muscle mass on his six-
foot, six—inch frame before the year is
out.

“Mike Bosnic will end up being a
real big guy,” said Freeman, who puts
his faith in Strength and Conditioning
Coach Buddy Morris when it comes to
bulking up his players.

Bosnic followed the Panthers long
before he weighed 265 pounds, listing
Craig “Ironhead” Heyward as one of
his Pitt heroes. The rookie has also
praised veteran lineman Tony Orlandini
for helping him with his technique and
the newly-installed West Coast Offense.

Despite the help, Bosnic has felt the
pressure (and punishment) of his new

environment. He says the practices
have been “more of a pounding” than
he’s used to. He’s also been on the
receiving end of a few tongue-lashings
from Freeman, but said that the shout-
ing is nothing new.

“My dad was my coach [in high
school],’’ he explained. “That was pret-
ty much all yelling.”

Thanks in part to dad’s coaching,
Bosnic joined Stradler and Barlow at
the Big 33 game this past summer —— an
annual clash between all-star high
school teams from Pennsylvania and
Ohio. It was there that Barlow had his
first true experience as a Pitt Panther.

“The game was about an hour or
two out of Penn State,” said Barlow of
the contest, “and people just wanted to
hang me off a tree when they heard I
went to Pitt.”

Catch the Steelers and the ”New Look" Pirates at Three Rivers

Have you just arrived in "the Burgh”
and need something to do? Or have you
been here for a couple of years and are tired
of the monotonous visits to the local water-
ing hole, where you’ll see all the same bor-
ing people drinking because they can’t
think of something more creative to do?

Well, here’s an alternative.

Go to a Pirates or Steelers game. A trip
to Three Rivers Stadium will give you a
chance to mingle with an entirely new eco-
nomic and social class. There will be the
Ted Tumers of the world sitting behind
home plate, families in the rnid-range levels

and the drunkards of the upper-deck
