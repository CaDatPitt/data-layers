As Palestinians prepare to approach
the United Nations in New York about
membership, shouts of, “Palestine
bring down the wall, democracy must
befor all,” echoed through the streets
of Oakland. ’

Students forjustice in Palestine
rallied at the intersection of Forbes
Avenue and Bigelow Boulevard Thurs-
dayto show supportforthe U.N. mem-
bership bid, waving Palestinian ﬂags
and signs that displayed phrases such
as “Palestine has the right to exist.”

About zsstudents who came out
to support the Palestinians marched
out into the middle of the intersection
during red lights to shout “Free, free
Palestine” and display a large Pales-
tinian ﬂag as cars drove by honking
horns. '

l The hour—long demonstration
took place on the International Day of
Democracy, aU.N. General Assembly-
observed day, which junior and SJP
President Ryan Branagan said is ﬁt-
tingto both the organization’s actions
Thursday and those expected of the
Palestinians next week.

“We want to raise awareness of
Palestinians’ sovereignty rights over
their land,” Branagan said. '

Palestinian Authority minister

Democracy
is not being
given to the
people.
— Karina
Goulordava

Riad Malki said Thursday in a press
release that if alternative solutions
are not proposed in time, Palestin-
ian President Mahmoud Abbas would
submit the application for full mem-
bership Sept. 23. g

Senior and Panthers for Israel
business manager Micah Toll said
that the Palestinian proposition for
membership is “unilateral.”

“They are avoiding peaceful nego-
tiations with Israel,” Toll said.

Panthers for Israel President Sam
Mellits said that by going to the U.N.,
Palestinians are makingthe chance for

. peace with Israelis more difficult.

“I would say [negotiations are]
the only option,” Mellits said. “The
U.N. does not give you peace. The U.N.

might give the Palestinians a state, but

that doesn’t give peace.” -
Bra/nagan said that if the Palestin-

ians go to the U.N., “diplomatic pres-

- sure will be placed on the U.S. and

Israel.” He said that the actions of the
states will demonstrate whether they
are committed to a two—state solution
and democracy in the Middle East.

J Israel and the United States have
both tried to stop the proposition
from going to the U.N., preferring
direct negotiations between Israel
and the Palestinians.

A year ago, a conflict concern-
ing Israeli settlement construction
in the West Bank and EastJerusalem
resulted in peace talks between Israel
and Palestinians. Those talks broke
down, and Palestinians claimed the
areas, both previously claimed by Is-
rael inthe 1967 Six-DayWar, fortheir
future state.

Since then, Palestinians have
started a campaign for U.N. mem-
bership based on their1967 borders,
with East Jerusalem as the potential
state’s capital.

Panthers for Israel, the Pittsburgh

Israel Public Affairs Committee and I

StandWithUs, a nonproﬁt, pro-Israel

education and advocacy program,

provided a joint statementwhich said,

“We support the creation of a demo-

cratic and independent Palestinian

state coexisting peacefully alongside
the Jewish and democratic State of
Israel. We understand that a lasting
peace between Israel and the Palestin-

ians is only possible through direct
bilateral negotiations.”

Senior and vice president of SJP
Karina Goulordava spent ﬁve weeks
in the Palestinian territories this" sum-
mer and said that she hopes that this
demonstrationwill bring attention to
the “Palestinian issue.”

“Democracy is not being given to
the people,” she said. “They deserve
that right.”

The New and Improved
Felon Barbie

Apparently even the most
impeccably dressed toys harbor
a dark side. According to the
Denver Post, two accomplices
named Barbie and Ken were
nabbed for allegedly stealing
iPads. (How they planned to
operate them without elbows
is still unclear.) Although both
parties are doubtlessly fretting
over how to pay their Dream

I House’s mortgage from jail, we
at The Pitt News believe they
have bigger problems —— after
all, how do you accessorize a
jump suit?

No Preservatives Needed

Anyone who says phone-
books are obsolete should con-
sult the owner of Bar 3 Bar~B-Q
restaurants, who lost $18,254 in
2009 and 2010 after his busi-
ness was listed as an “Animal
Carcass Removal” service, ac-
cording to the Associated Press.
Although the mistaken road—kill
handlers have received innu-

ajay Leno nod, we think they
should take the attention as a
compliment: misidentifying
certain fast—food chains in the
same fashion, we suspect, would
fail to raise any eyebrows. - l

Although the store, is doubt-
lessly taking steps to ensure its
products won’t be susceptible

to the same covert sampling in T

the future, we’d like to point out
that this would never happen
in a Target.

Laser Cats

As if kittens weren’t already
the most, miraculous of nature’s

' creations, ABC News reports

that the Mayo Clinic injected
cats with a gene that combats
feline immunodeﬁciency virus

'(FIV), which leads to AIDS. To

track its progress, researchers
paired this gene with one from
a ﬂuorescent jellyﬁsh, causing
the felines to radiate an eerie
green under a blue light. This
prompts us to ask UPMC: The
Mayo Clinic’s cats can cure AIDS
and glow in the dark — what
have your pets done lately?

Erecting a Monument

Not a whole‘ lot happens in
Council Bluffs, Iowa. So when a
6—foot-tall hot dog statue with
human features appeared near
a school-bus stop, police were
understandably perplexed,
local newspaper The Daily
Nonpareil reports. While the
mysterious ﬁgurine remains in
apolice storage facility, we urge
citizens to take advantage of the

situation. Perhaps, as is the case ‘

with many statues, rubbing this
Wiener‘ will bring good luck.

On-campus

stadium

important for school spirit

Andrew Kaback
Columnist

»Are you ready for some high-

octane football?

Without inciting protests
from the chemistry department
about how hydrocarbons just
don’t make great linebackers,

_I. think we can all agree that

football is ‘Welcome at Pitt.
After a winter of discontent
— filled with discarded fake
moustaches and arrest war-
rants — the campus commu-
nity could use something to
bring us together. -

Let’s face it: In the wake ’

of recent budget cuts, there
isn’t too much to get excited
about. Yes, the revamped sec-
ond floor of Sennott Square
looks great, and those ridicu-
lous blue markings on all ofour
trees appear to be fading away,
but disasters, downgrades and
deposed dictators just keep

bringing me down. Seriously
though, who thought smurﬁng
the Cathedral lawn’s trees was
a good idea?

Yet the changing leaves and
cooling temperatures signal
that good old Pitt football has
begun. It’s time to board the
bus, sit in traffic for an hour,
choose between entering the
stadium four hours early or
tailgating indefinitely, watch
a three—hour game, wait for a
bus for an hour, sit in another
hour of traffic and finally get
home just in time for the vic-
tory lights to be turning off.
That is,if We’re lucky.

Come to think of it, doesn’t
that routine seem a little ri-
diculous? Why can’t Pitt have
an on-campus stadium? I know
it might get in the way of our
“beautiful” blue-painted trees,
but it’s time that a change was
made. '

We’re students, and welove
our Saturdays. Yes, we could

play in New Castle, Pa., and
die-hard football fans would
still show up. The problem is
that the average student might
not want to devote eight hours
to a football game. So what if
they come for “Sweet Caroline”
and leave right afterward?

College football is about so
much more than the game it-
self. For as much as ESPN fol-
lows every statistic and stand-
ing, the real joy can often be
found offthe field. It can be the
first time that a freshman floor
does something together. It can
be a chance for old friends t_o
reunite overisome barbecue in
a parking lot. I_t can be an ex-
cuse to quit worrying about a
test or a roommate issue and
just scream really loudly for an
extended period of time.

For students, it’s the per-
fect way to come together as
one school. I hate when sports
get over—appreciated as much

as the next guy, but this isn’t about
giving athletes a free pass or treating
them like royalty. This is about ensur-
ing the average student has a love for
this school, community and tradition.
Just look around and see the pride that
Pittsburghers have in their Steelers and
how it brings everyone together.

As for alumni, it's a perfect excuse to
head back to campus. I can’t even say
how many times I hear, “Oh, I make it to
a football game or two every year, but I

haven’t been back to Oakland in years.”
Should their fond memories of college
days be relived overlooking a casino?
The Pitt community extends far beyond
the current student body, but how can
we come together if graduation is our
last ever glance at the Cathedral? How
do we allow Oakland to become a ghost
town onfootball days‘?

Yet another reason that we need
an on—campus stadium: I went with a
friend who goes to West Virginia to the

Backyard  well, it wasn’t too much of a
Brawl this past year. As we were walking
out of the stadium, he turned to me and
asked, “So you guys take classes here?”
Allan outsider might ever see of Pitt is
its football games. In other words, they

Awon’t see Pitt-at all. Although I would

love to rip West Virginia apart, they
got something right in locating their
stadium on campus.

' I’m cautiously optimistic about our
current football season, our new head

Stadium can be excuse to return to campus

coach and our fresh philosophy. I hope
we’ll be singing “Sweet Caroline” all
the way to the top of the Big East Con-
ference. ’
Unfortunately, even if we were to
win a National Championship, some—
thing would be missing: the difference
between college football andjust plain

‘ football. I hope we stay out of off-the-

field troubles and that we win them
all, but I really wish we could do it on
campus. I

After two underwhelming wins
on its home field, the Pitt foot-
ball team will face Iowa on Sat-
urday in the Panthers’ first road
test of the season.

A week after the Maine Black
Bears sacked quarterback Tino
Sunseri seven times and the de-
fense gave up two late—fourth-
quarter touchdowns, Pitt is still
looking to completely gel, both
offensively and defensively,
with head coach Todd Graham’s
no-huddle system.

“The biggest thing during

D week one and two is a lack of

execution,” Graham said. “I

think at the end of both games_
we’ve become complacent. It’s.

not how you start, it’s how you
finish.” - .
Sunseri has been a favorite

_topic among fans and media

alike this week after he strug-
gled against Maine, throwing
for 224 yards with two inter-

, ceptions. Graham put freshman

backup quarterback Trey An-
derson in the game following
Sunseri’s second interception, a
move the coach said he planned
before the game even started.
Graham added that Sunseri
is his starting quarterback.
“Has he played well? No, he
hasn’t playedwell,” Graham
said at a press conference on
‘Monday. “He’s made some good
plays, but he’s got to play better
and execute our system and I’ve
got a lot of confidence in him.

I’ve seenhim do it in practice-

I’ve seen him do it in games.
And in this system, there’s-no
question I think he can be suc-
cessful, and he’s a‘ guy that has
‘come a long way. in his work
‘ethic and all those things,”

Pitt quarterbacks coach
Todd Dodge echoed Graham’s
words. ' ‘

‘‘Tino’s our guy,” Dodge said
on‘ Wednesday. “There is way
too much he’s doing good in this
offense to put him on a short
leash.”

Dodge said that there were
stretches against Maine dur-
ing which Sunseri executed the
offense almost perfectly, but
others where he was inconsis-
tent — such as in reading the
defensive ends. That will take

work, Dodge added, because it’s.

the first time Sunseri’s done it
in a live situation.

“The. guy will absolutely
respond to constructive criti-
cism,” Dodge said. “And he has
responded over the last two

‘days [of practice].”

Redshirtjunior running back
Ray Graham has been a bright
spot for the ‘Panther offensively,
as he leads the nation with a
161-yard average per game.

“My goal is to just go out
there and have fun,” Ray Gra-
ham said. “Just get the team

a victory. It’s just not me out
__ there, we’re all doing this to-
" gether.”

Iowa head coach Kirk Fer-
entz said he knows his team will
face a challenge-‘against Pitt’s
running game with Ray Graham

  on the ﬁeld.

“Probably the first thing we
would tell you is he’s a strong
runner, really a strong, ag-
gressive type guy,’so you know
you’re going to have to tackle
him,” Ferentz said in a press
conference on Tuesday. “He’s

got good vision, like most backs A

do. But he’s a guy you really have
to tackle. He’s a good football

player.” . ~

The Panthers will most likely
add another dynamic to their
offense -against the Hawkeyes
as Anthony Gonzalez returns
from a four—month suspension
for possession of marijuana.
Todd Graham said the backup
quarterback turned three-back
would see time against Iowa.

“I’m excited for him. I think
he’s worked his tail off,” Todd

. Graham said. “He’s a very self-

less guy in that _he’s going to
play -another position forus this
year. I’m excited‘ about him. I’m
really pleased how he’s handled
this situation. I’ve got a lot of

USF, WVU start season strong

Roger Sepich
Staff Writer

After the conference cruised to
a perfect 8-0 record in college
football’s openingvweekend,
some Big East football teams
ran into stumbling‘ blocks in
week two. The results-left half
of theleague at 1-1 and half of
the league undefeated. "
Heading into what could be

'a crucial week three for the Big

East, here aregmy rankings of

the eight football teams in the"

conference:

1) South Florida — The Bulls
vault to the top of my standings
on the back of their 37-7 demoli-

tion of Ball State. Unlike Pitt and

West Virginia, USF dominated
from the first play as they re-
turned a fumble for a touchdown

on the opening kickoff. Quar-
terback B.J. Daniels did his best
to show that the Bulls’ upset of
Notre Dame in week one was no
ﬂuke as he racked up 373 yards
of total offense.

2) West Virginia — For the
second straight week, the
Mountaineers struggled early
only to turn a potential upset
into a blowout in the second
half. Trailing Norfolk State at
halftime cost West Virginia the
top spot in my rankings, but if
they can play a whole game like
they played the second half this
weekend — outscoring their
FSC opponent 45-0 —— then the
Mountaineers could run away
with the conference. .

3) Pittsburgh — Pitt fans ex-.
pecting a blowout win Saturday
over Maine left disappointed by
the Panthers’ six-point victory,

but I’m reserving judgment until
I see how Pitt copes with this
weekend’s tough road game at
Iowa. A win will make the Pan-
thers a Big East favorite again,
but a loss could result in dimin-
ishedexpectations and possibly _
a quarterback controversy.

4) Syracuse - The fourth and
ﬁnal undefeated Big East team
also held on to beat a FCS team
as the Orange picked up a 21-14
victory over Rhode Island. Last
week I said Syracuse was built ‘
to win close games, and they did
just that. For the second straight
week, quarterback Ryan Nassib
came through in the fourth quar-
ter. An upset against Southern
California in week three would .,
be a huge statement victory for
Syracuse.

‘Pitt fans booed last Saturday as

they watched the University of

Maine’s defense race past the
Panthers’ offensive line and
sack Tino Sunseri seven times
— nearly a third as many as
the Panthers gave up all last
season.

Maine competes in the Foot-
ball Championship Subdivision.
Itsdefense isn’t exactly the ’85
Chicago Bears. Yet it somehow

. .managed to turn Sunseri into a '

tackling prop. So what caused
this gaping hole in Pitt’s of-
fense?

According to the coaches
and players who discussed the
game at a press conference on
Wednesday, the answer is pretty

simple.

“It was just a breakdown here
and there,” offensive line coach
Spencer Leftwich said. “It wasn’t
a scheme issue. It wasn’t, ‘This
person’s getting beat.’ It was a
one—person technique here, a
one—person technique there.
Now obviously, playing offen-
sive line, if one link goes down
it affects everybody else.”

Still, the big bodies up front
were disappointed with their of-
fensive performance last week.
Senior right guard Lucas Nix
said his unit’s play was “sub-
par.” Leftwich agreed.

“It wasn’t our best week,” he
said. “The best thing the kids
did was ‘really come in Sun-

day to get-better, to get it cor-'

rected. We did. We know where
the flaws lie, and we addressed
those. We’re looking real for-

ward to this week.” *

Leftwich, who coached the
offensive line at Tulsa last year
before following Todd Graham
to Pitt, said his players prac-
ticed staying on the right per-
son, finishing blocks and keep-
ing their pads at the right levels
— “those things you strive to
teach every day.”

, To be sure, the offensive
line is not solely" to blame for
last Saturday’s sack-filled day.
Fans are naturally inclined to
blame sacks on missed blocks,
just as they’re almost certain to
blame interceptions entirely on
a quarterback. But it’s not until
the game ends and the emotions
fade that blame can properly be
placed -—‘ on the backﬁeld as
well as the line.

“When the public sees six
sacks, they think the offensive

line is terrible,” quarterbacks
coach Todd Dodge said. “Well,
there is more to protecting the
quarterback than the offensive
line. The receivers are respon-
sible, the backs, and the quar-
terback is responsible himself.
That’s something we need .to
improve from last game to this
game — just pocket presence
and knowing when to step up
and get rid of the ball.”
Graham said that his play-
ers are still adjusting to the new
offensive system, which disre-
gards huddles and requires line-
men to make quick decisions.
Never one for excuses, Graham
said he and his staff are partially
responsible for his team’s lack
of execution. “We’re not getting
[the system] taught at the pace
we thought we were.” '
To help players adapt to the

pPitt still adjusting, looks toseal leaky offensive line

new formations and blocking

qpatterns, coaches have been

emphasizing the importance
of reacting as opposed to over-
thinking schemes. Nix said that,
slowly, he sees his unit making
progress.

“You’re not going to pick up
the system in one offseason, in
one practice. But We’re making
a lot of strides to get to where
we need to be. People are start-
ing to understand more and
more what they’re expected to

do — to react and not think so .

much.” _

On Saturday, the Panthers
will battle the toughest defense
they have seen thus far, in Iowa.
Despite the Hawkeyes’ surren-
dering 44 points to Iowa State

Football > 10

Rankings 4 7

Knights were a two—point con-
version away from taking North
Carolina to overtime in Chapel
Hill, despite finishing with a net
total of 1 yard rushing. Quarter-
back Chas Dodd and receiver
Mohamed Sanu kept Rutgers in

. - -it and showed the entire Big East

that head coach Greg Schiano’s
team'has the potential to be
competitive in the conference
this year.

6) Connecticut — After falling
_behind 14-3 at Vanderbilt, the
A Huskies rallied back to take a 21-

14 lead only to throw the game
away — literally — as an inter-
ception return for a touchdown
handed ‘Vanderbilt a three-
point victory. However, there
“were some game highlights’ for
UConn, namely freshman run-
ning back Lyle McCombs run-
ning more than 100 yards for
his second-straight game.
- 7) Cincinnati — The Bearcats
..couldn’t keep up with Tennessee
as they lost to the Volunteers 45-
23. The Cincinnati offense, led
by quarterback Zach Collaros
and running back Isaiah Pead,

did its part, but the defense will
have to be much better going
forward if the Bearcats plan on

' making any noise in the Big East

this season. «
8) Louisville — For the second
straight week, Louisville finish-
es at the bottom of my stand-
ings. The Cardinals had an op-
portunity to impress a national
television audience Friday night
with a winnable game against
Florida International, but it was
the FIU Panthers who stole the
stage as they physically domi-
nated Louisville throughout. It
could be a long year for head
coach Charlie Stron‘g’s team.
Offensive Player of the Week:
B.]. Daniels, Quarterback, South
Florida — In his third year start-
ing, Daniels appears to finally be
making the most of his talents
at the quarterback position.
Despite sitting for most of the
second half of the Bulls’ blowout
victory, Daniels still managed

.to tally almost 400 yards of of-

fense and added a touchdown.
Defensive Player of the Week:
Phillip Thomas, Safety, Syracuse

  -,Cincinnatti, Louisville drop

— The junior defensive back
made sure the Orange weren’t
upset by Rhode Island as -he re-
corded two interceptions, in-
cluding one crucial pick in the
fourth quarter to preserve the
win. . '

Coach of the Week: Skip
Holtz, South Florida — I’m not
sure what Holtz said to his
team in the locker room before
the game, but whatever it was,
it worked. While many of the
conference’s other teams were
struggling with lower opposi-
tion, the Bulls jumped out to a
30-0 halftime lead against Ball
State and never looked back.

‘, What to watch for in week
three: Real games — Most of the

teams in the conference have

gotten the early-season games
against FCS and MAC schools

‘out of the way,’ and there are

quite a few good matchups on
the. schedule this weekend.
Iowa State, Maryland, Iowa,
Kentucky, and USC will all play
Big East schools in what could
be a critical weekend for the
conference. I

confidence in him and I’ll be real hon-
est with you, we watch his development

' and I’m excited. I think he can really

help us.”

Defensively, the most important goal
for the Panthers might be to stop the
run.

“I think the key in this game is go-
ing to be playing hard—nosed smash
mouth,” Todd Graham said. “A 3—yard
gain is a positive gain for them. That
doesn’t bother them one bit. They’ll line
up and do it again and again and again
and again.”

Iowa is coming off of a triple—over—
time loss to Iowa State in which running
back Marcus Coker collected 143 yards
and two touchdowns, but the Panthers
have defended the run well so far this
season.

If Pitt manages to shut down the run—_
ning game, the Panthers willalso have to
face a passing attack featuring two solid
wide receivers in senior Marvin McNutt
and junior Keenan Davis.

McNutt averages 100.5 yards per
game, and Davis averages 62.5 yards
per game. The two have combined for
three touchdowns this year.

“You’re going to have to control their
two really good wide receivers that are

big-time playmakers,” Todd Graham
said. “You can’t give up cheap ones.
That’s what it’s going to boil down to.
We’ve got to get takeaways; we’ve got to
give our offense a short field because
I think the strength of their team, no

He completed 16 of28 passes, 207 yards

the‘ defense to play well against Iowa,

fensive line is the best the Panthers will
have faced so far this season. He pointed
to centerjames Ferentz and left tackle
Riley Reiff in particular. . ’

“They’re very big, physical, and grind
it out,” Graham said. “They’re not going
to beat themselves.”

Graham said he’s excited for the chal-
lenge the game against Iowa presents.

“Going in there, it’s going to be loud,
it’s going to be hostile for our offense,”
he said. “Our defense has to play big
time and I expect them to do that. I’ve

got no doubt in my mind they’re going '

to do that, and I’m looking forward to
our guys playing their best game this
