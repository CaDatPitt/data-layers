hpe-electi-ons .- this year are of
3" en greater importance than they

 and ‘every fraternity man and
man‘ realizes this and have gone -
ll out’?-on the merit basis in se-
ng-their candidates for posi-
gons in’ the ‘vital student organiza-
tons. A _

We have all heard a great deal
I) tthe amendment that promises
ual representation in the Stu-
nt‘-‘Faculty association. Represen-
ion; in SFA means very little
thout active, wholehearted sup-
rtlof-the decisions that may come
t of the assembly.’

j_The primary proof of support
ould undoubtedly come from dem-
‘ratic elections that we have had,
re at Pitt. We promise our whole
,, arted support to our candidates
i;idf/will vote against the amend-
,ent in a body.

‘The important thing" is that we
go out and vote‘ the best man,‘ and
‘”‘on,"t_become too excited over the
fact -that we have two ‘parties run-
-iiing ‘candidates. -

Of the fraternity men and wom-
n we ask wholehearted straight-
late support, for it is only by
traight slate voting that we can
. pe to elect the candidates whom
vw feel are best qualiﬁed forthese
esponsible positions. .

Ben Foote, C42, ‘fraternity; “Hav-
ing been active in both independent
and fraternity politics in my four
year at Pitt, I do not feel that the
aims of the independents are funda-
mentally different from those of
the fraternity party.”

Bill Seyler, C42, independent:
“As a member of the elections com-
mittee, I am going to assure an
honest, upright. and fair election,
and I’m sure the independents will
win.”

‘ Hal Gondelman, C43, independ-

I hope it doesn't rain and I hope

that the fraternity men can be kept

- Lee McFadden, BA44, frater-
nity: “I cannot see how the inde-
pendents will back an amendment
that they don’t believe in them-
selves. They are backing it only
because of political expediency.”

Dave Truan, C44, fraternity:
“Fraternities will place at least
three slates. The independents have
a foolish campaign for this reason
——-if they can carry enough votes to
ratify the amendment, over the 900
fraternity votes, they can place

Paul Pﬁschner, C44, independent:
“If the fraternity men don’t jam
the polls at 12:30 and give the stu-
dents a fair chance to vote, and if
the fraternity men don’t intimidate
the student body into voting for

Jerry Finegold, BA44, fraternity:
“In regard to the platform of the

Vbers, Men’s council representatives

Polls will be open until _ 5:30
o’clock this evening.

An equal representation amend-
ment for a 16-16 ratio between fra-
ternity and Independent candidates
will be on the ballot today. Approv-
al of the proposed amendment will
give the Independents more seats
in SFA than they have ever obtain-
ed. . ‘

‘Show of identiﬁcation cards
' will be necessary to vote today,
Theodore W. Biddle, acting dean-

of men, announced.

To push the amendment the In-
dependents have abolished slates,
compelling individual campaigning,
throwing all of their support to
voting “yes” for equal representa-
tion._ — ' ’

iApproximately 1,700 students
arepexpcﬁted to vote today, de-
pending on the weather. Rain"
_means a probable fraternity vic-
tory; fair’ weather, an Independent‘
chance. Fraternities promise 900».
votes. Independents “expect: 800
and pray for 901.”»

Record number of votes was 1,900
in 1938.:Last year 1,425 ballots
were cast.

Independents _have conducted
Tuck shop mass meetings, distrib-
uted leaﬂets and used a telephone
campaign in an attempt to defeat
the SFA fraternity majority and...
gain support for their “war ac-‘
tivities” campaign.

The Independent platform advo-
cates a decrease of unnecesary ac-
tivities to promote the war effort
at Pitt, cooperative student,hous-
ing, bookstore and‘eating place;
curtailment of money losing danc-
‘es; compulsory physical education,
and an inter-city collegiate discus--
sion group. '

As usual, fraternities have con-
ducted no campaign,‘ but quietly
assigned houses to support each of
the “compromise” slates.

Fraternities apparently have
patched up the rift in lnter-frater-
nity steering committee which be-
gan with a split between two rival
factions and" was believed to be
one of the reasons which delayed
the ﬁnal lists of candidates until
just two days before elections.

Last year fraternities. swept
every one of their 24 candidates
into SFA, won every office in the
College association and took seven
seats in Men’s council.’

Independents received only nine
seats out of»44, result of the most
spectacular fraternity victory since
Independents organized.

' There are two reasons, why every
student ‘should vote “yes” on. the
equal representation plebiscite to-
day. _ ~ —

First,'student government spends ,

every .student’s. money. The Inde-
pendents wantthatmoney spent in

the interests of ALLvthe students,

not just the-favored few who now
have complete control of student-
government.

Second, the Independents have
