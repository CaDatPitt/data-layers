Moorhead Critizes  
"Military Expenditures

quiet, several hundred students
listened as Dr. Arthur Tuden of
the anthro department opened
Friday’s rally aided at getting
more support for the Monday
march of the Black Coalition.

Congressman William S. Moorhead (D.-Pa.) argued in favor of a 
redirection of Federal funds from unnecessary military projects to vi ‘
tal social programs in an address Friday in the SU Ballroom. “We have 1
placed to much emphasis on providing for the common defense,” he
maintained, “and not enough to promoting the general welfare.”

Speaking extemporaneously, Moorhead described the effects of a
“shifting of the Congressional battlefield over the past ten years” on-
the nature of the liberal representative’s struggle for social progress.
“Previously,” he declared, “the fight revolved around whether or not
to approve certain programs. Today, the fight if for additional funds
for programs which have already been approved.”

The Shadyside Democrat ruled out the possibility of obtaining mon-
'ey through the method of increased deficit spending, because of the
serious inflationary trends which already pose a threat to the economic
stability of the United States. He also opposed a tax increase. “The only
' , other available source,” Moorhead concluded, “is our large military

lawlessness which some people
attribute to these type of demon-
strations, he said that it’s a shame

have gone unheeded for years. Tu-

Moorhead criticized the expenditure of “unnecessary” sums. Singling
out “the maintenance of forces sufficient to fight a major war with Rus-
sia in Europe and a major war with China in Asia simultaneously,” he
argued that the Sino-Soviet dis- ‘
pute rendered that posture unnec-

on‘ the grounds that “it wouldn't
work” and criticized the develop-
ment of Multiple Independently
Targeted Re-entry Vehicles
(MIRVS) because it could- “vir-
doom arms
agreements.” Moorhead support-
ed, however, the construction of
additional Polaris submarines if
necessary to ensure deterrence.

‘ predicted, “the Chinese would ad-

on the other hand, the Chinese got
involved with the United States in

‘ would attack-Outer Mongolia. In
either case, .the United States
would not be obliged to fight two
‘major wars simultaneously.”

Moorhead readily admitted that
Congress has not adequately in-
vestigated proposed weapons sys-
tems in the past. “However,” he
contended, “we have started a
process of education that will pay
off with more rational defense

V budgets in yearsto come.”

Asked to comment on the con-
flict between the Master Builders
Association and the Black Coali-_

ingly, he deplored the Nixon ad-

Tuden expressed his indigna-

He stated that there have been

have these laws enforced as “ac-
complices of crime. We want
them to be brought to‘justice.”_

The second speaker at the rally
was equally incensed about the
priority of some laws inthe minds
of the people. He said, “There is

the American conservatives than
putting laws on the “books and ig-
noring them.-” He went on that the
blacks have been going through
law, and talking to the construc-
tion industry since W. E. B. Du
Bois tried’to break the blacks into
the industry in 1901.

The ‘same speaker accused the‘
police of having a completely ad-
verse attitude toward the blacks,’
but when the white construction
workers marched only two -days
later, they were greeted ‘with
smiles of approval by the police;

As the crowd, basically quiet,
and ever growing in numbers lis- ..
tened, the speaker recanted a
story of September in 1909,
when the steel workers of Pitts-
burgh went out on strike and re- I

action that the blacks have so re-
cently received from the police.

A far more vehement speaker
was a black grad student from the
University, who sarcastically
hinted at the effect of rallies such
as this. “Students like to get their
minds fertilized,” he remarked,
“but this is so often where it re-
mains fertilized.”

He continued, telling the assem-
bly that it is easier today‘for afor-

MDC Proposals

  Security Heads Agenda

by DANA VENTRIGLIA
Staff Feature Writer

The Men’s Dormitory Council has at least four
major projects on the agenda for this year. They
vary from a proposed boat trip on the Allegheny Riv-

' er, to having security doors put in-the Towers to sep-
parate the lobby from the living area.

The plans for -the boat trip are still in the mak-
ing, but as of now there will be room for 210 cou-
ples living on campus, including those students re-

V siding in the sorority and fraternity houses. The
. _ V '. price has not" been set, but the evening will definite-

The Council is now making an effort to provide I
the campus policemen with legal protection against
law suits claiming police brutality. This is being

done so that the policemen will be able to apprehend
agitators without the fear of being sued.

In an attempt to curb the number of thefts and
assaults in the Towers, MDC has also proposed an
important security project. Doors will be installed
between the Towers lobby and the living area to pro-

plans call for the locking of the doors at 11 p.m.

  Black   Monday

by DAVE TIERNAN
Editor, The Pitt News

Today is Black Monday.

Today, many people both black and white will
march in Pittsburgh to support the Black Coalition in its
negotiations with Construction Union people for black
_ jobs in the city.

Many people in all cities of America will watch
closely to see what happens in Pittsburgh. It has become
a test case for black workers. A precedent will be set
for other cities to follow. That precedent will be not
only the final outcome of the negotiations, but the way ‘in
which supporters of both sides act, react, and are acted
upon.

There have been numerous marches, arrests, beatings,
and blood-shed already. Before an agreement is reached,
there will undoubtedly be more. It is sad that people
must injure other people, that lives must be risked, that
hatred must prevail, that the situation must be view
ed as a game in which one side will ultimately win and
the other side will lose. It is frightening to think that
the streets of Pittsburgh could flow with blood, and that

' the three rivers could carry that blood and what it re-

presents to every city in America. Why? Why mustit
be this way?

I guess no one knows the answer. There has to be a
better way to solve problems between people that by
bloody confrontation. A city government that is receptive
to the problems of its poor citizens as well as its rich
ones is one possible answer. Where are the potential
mayoral candidates? Will they wait in the shadows un-
til the violence has ruined the city before they at-
tempt to settle the problems?

It seems strange sitting here (it’s early Monday

morning) typing, knowing that there has to be an answer.  ;

betterthan another "march,"yet also knowing that after
five days of thinking about it, I’ve got to join my
friends, my brothers, my fellow man. At least they are do-
ing something.

I don't know if I am doing the right thing by join-
ing the march, but I figure that in a case of indecision’ it
is better to do something (even though I feel there is
better way, but what???) than nothing. --

Kids: More Than Just Negatives‘-""

Children are strange animals. For many months
now I have been a keen observer of the heart-warm-
ing, hilarious antics of the children in the various
sections of Pittsburgh, and they never cease to
amaze me.

My summer job as a photographer required that
I have a camera in myipossession almost constant-

I ly, and believe me, the presence of a camera can
’ really give rise to some strange situations when it

comes to kids. Take one time" in the Hill District
when I was doing research for an English term-pa-
per. There I was sitting in the patrol car outside of
the station when a group of kids came up and mum-
bled something about wanting their pictures on tele-
vision and begged me to take them.

And then there was the time when I was shoot-
ing an assignment in a Catholic grade school in the
East Liberty area of Pittsburgh. I was standing at
the front of a‘ first grade class of about 40 students
talking to their nun-teacher while waiting for my
picture subjects to present themselves in frontfof
my camera. As my subjects filed in the first grad-
ers began to raise their hands with a barely control-
able excitement, One by one the nun recognized
them, and one by one they told her that they knew
one of the students perched at the front of the class-

room. Then it happened. One, little, almost toothless.

boy stood up, and in an embarrassed voice said,
“That man looks nice; he has neat sideburns.” In

astonishment I looked around the room and came to

the conclusion that I was the closest thing to a man
present in the room. After completing my meek
thanks another student, a girl this time, stood up. By
this time I was ready to make a hasty departure
from the classroom. The girls rosy cheeks were
moving with the speed available only to a young kid,
and I couldn’t believe that she was asking the nun to
tell the class my name so that they could say hello
to me. But she was. As the nun did not know my
name I blurted it out of my quavering lips only .to
have my words clipped short as the entire class
stood up and with the boys bowing and the girls
curtseying said in an almost surrealistic voice,
“Good afternoon Tom Walsh.” Tell me I wasn’t
floored. I said good afternoon and the class sat down

with toothless smiles on their faces implying that al‘r";,,,2

was right in the special world that young children
have a monopoly on.

Yes children are indeed stra'nge. For example
take the time last week when my date and I were
walking up the stairs from the Student Union to the
Quad when a small boy, no older than nine gave my
date a firm little love pat on her rear end. And after
talking to the kid later it just didn’t seem feasible
that he ate out of the same mouth that uttered the

‘profanities that his did. Man, when I was nine I

still thought that the onlyconnotation for the word
f‘ass” was the type of animal that Jesus rode on.

Well, who am I to judge; I just wish I could buy a
key to the private community reserved for kids.

In lieu of . the [recent racial

In a society which has institu-

rising up and overthrowing his

Practicalitx Counts

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Editorial Editor

Senator William Moorhead was
very nervous Friday afternoon. It
kind of looked like his mouth was
moving at a different rhythmn
from his words. It was a consis-
tent gesture since it soon became
evident that the Pittsburgh liberal
of the House of Representatives is
really a thinly disguised conser-
vative.

He spent most of his scheduled
hour attacking the Nixon admin-
istration on its priorities and po-
licies from a purely financial-
practical basis. He proposed
changes in procedure rather than
a reevaluation of motives.

While claiming that Nixon is all
wrong in stressing superiority over
efficiency in the military budget
plans, Moorhead himself admitted
a strong affiliation to the concept
of deterence, which implies su-
superiority in armaments for its
success.

“Deterrence is necessary for
the defense of this country. But I
define deterrence as the ability
to kill each Soviet citizen once if
we are attacked by the enemy. We
don’t have to kill a person twice,”
he moralized.

His logic was impeccable
with his rationale, the US, of
course, does not need a “12—0
superiority.” About 2-0 will do.

Along the same line, the Sena-
tor -wondered why our army must
be prepared. at all times to fight
wars on a “21/2” basis. “Right
now, the US army is prepared to
wage two major wars (in Asia and
Europe) and a conventional one
(in Latin America, in case there is
something there that the US must
put down ).”

Why so much, propositioned
Moorhead. “The United States
only needs to be prepared to fight
one major war.”

His opposition to Nixon went to

ridiculous extremes, considering

SENATOR WILLIAM MOORHEAD A

that it appeared to be based on po-
litical opportunity rather than
real commitment. This flaw came
out when he was asked to state
his position on biological-chemical
warfare. “I don’t know that much
about it,” be began. “But I prob-
ably have more horrors of biologi-
cal warfare than does the Nixon
administration.”

 

Monday, September 15, 1969-—THE PITT NEWS—Pagel 5‘

While he claimed to be sincere
in his “horror” of “growing fed-
eral power,” the Congressman’s
objection to the size of the mili-
tary budget was founded on the
proposition that it was “taking
federal funds from other pro-
grams.”

Further contradicting his ear-
lier statement, Moorhead suggest-
ed that the Black Coalition in its
fight with the union complex rely
upon a little help form its friends.

“I thin that this problem can be
solved if you look at the programs
already within industry. Also, the
threat of federal legislation can be
used to make voluntary changes.
It is unfortunate, however, that
the Nixon administration is cut-
ting back job training.”

But it cannot be said that the
Representative is "not doing his
share. Although he couldn’t make
it to the Black Monday demo-
stration, he offered the “support
of his three black employees in
Washington.” ~*

 

wice’-Moorhead Smith»-

(Continued from Page 1)

Black Coalition was formed to
channel energies into negotiations
with the Master Builders’ Asso-
ciation. According to Smith, “We
are as far from a settlement now
as we were 11 days ago.

The Master Builders’ Associa-_.

tion has made a proposal to the
Coalition at a cost of $300,000 less
than the Coalition’s proposal.
However, the Association’s pro-
posal will not involve any blacks
in the unions. The Coalition’s de-
mands involve an increase in
black membership in the unions
from the present one-half per cent
to 25 per cent over a period of
five years, five percent ayear.

The question was raised as to
what whites could do to help the
Coalition. Smith replied that let-
ters could be written and that
bail money was needed.

According to Smith, negotia-
tions are continuing. DIG I “prov-
ed it could be done by the black
people.”

Each Quartc rh ackHits

For TD In Scrimmage

by ED CONLEY

Last week a guard was plac-
ed at the gate leading to the
Panther practice fields to pre-
vent onlookers from getting too
close to the action. Friday, how-
ever, the university policemen
loosened’ the restrictions because
it was a special day.

Carl De Pasqua was sending his
gridders out into their final scrim-
mage before the season opener.
And some ‘family, friends, and
students wanted to see how the‘
squad was developing. ' '

It’s hard to tell if the spectators
were pleased with the Panther per-
formance, but DePasqua let it be
known that he wasn’t. '

“We’re not making the pro-
gress we expected; we don’t have
the timing. And so far we’ve been
real sluggish,” he noted after the

\ action. .

There were some moments of.

excitement for the crowd, though.
’ George Medich’s reception of a

- short pass from Chuck Winters,

for instance, brought a buzz from
the gathering. Medich broke away
from both safeties, George Pri-
bish and Dave Dibbley, and gal-
loped into the end zone for a touch-
down.

The Panther secondary didn’t
look too bad in "the scrimmage,
however. Twoother TD tosses did
occur, butboth were on well-cov-

_.ered plays. Steve Moyer grabbed

a quick pass ‘from Fran’ Gustine
early in the scrimmage and"Jim
Friedl lofted. a six-point aerial to
Lloyd Rogers near the practice’
conclusion. V .

Final figures saw the quarter-
backs completing 16 of 29 at-
temps, but almost all of the tosses
were short ones. The only -long
“bomb” attempt resulted in an in-

' 6 completion -for,.,F,riedl, who went

5-for-14 on his passing. Gustines

« One player that the coach would

who has quit the squad.  ..

“We looked good on the short

passes,” DePasqua mentioned.
“But, we had too many drops.”

The offense turned to the ground
for the only other scores of the
day. Dave Garnett romped for a
TD after breaking into the clear
on a run off right tackle, and

Friedl bootlegged into the’ end,

“Our defense is improving,”
DePasqua said. “But, we missed
a lot of tackles out there?’ -

One of the bright spots for the
defense was the fact that they
caught Gustine behind the line
five times for big losses. The de-
fense’s superiority over‘the offen-
sive line was evident on those

plays.

“That’s' one of our big problems.
We’re looking for the stable situa-
tion on the line,” the coach ob-

especially good for Gustine, the '1

other quarterbacks were able to

stay away from the dirt. And the ‘

runners found quite a few holes
opened for them when they reach-
ed the line. _*

-This is what the backs will need

‘to emphasize that his. team will

in the final scrimmage.

, Speed Disadvantages,

by MARTHA HARTLE
’ Associate .Sports Editor _ , A. —

There hasn’t been much talk about the '_-Panther. passing
game this fall, but whenever the subject does come up, the name‘

of Steve Moyer always creeps intothe conversation. - -
. Moyer is the sure-handed sophomore-split end’ who has been catch-

. ing anything thrown his way in practice

he- doesn’t have the‘ size‘ or the
great speed. usually attributed to

. wide receivers, yet he’s currently

holding "down the starting spot

‘withthe offense.- ‘ . '

In high school, Moyer won num-

‘erous honors as a running back,

but sincelcomiiig to Skyscraper U.

he’sVbeen counted on strictly as a ’
receiver. He was the leading re-’

ceiver on last season’s?_,f'reshman_—
club and made some outstanding
catches in the /“spring game last
Aprilm g   ‘ _
“‘We’re running a control pass

offense this fall,” explained the
sophomore receiver, “And so-far

’ it seems adequate." _‘ a
player and valuable asset ‘to "the 1.

continued.’

Moyer doesn’t." have any prefer-3

ence in th'e'type’of, pattern he runs,

just_so~ long as he gets open. “I '
’ just,-~ha_ve to‘try'to but maneuver
’ the defender,’-’ he explained. “I

don’t -have thatgreat speed’ so I
just tryxto findan openspot_."’ ' - ‘

With a lot of stres_s__on— the run:

the shortpasses, those between"

Moyer isn’t making any’predic-

Tommy Prothro went to the junior

Herniated Muscles Keep

Richey Out I nde finitely

by EVAN PATTAK _
It is easy to pick Jerry Richey out of the crowd of harriers

. loping down breezy Flagstaff Hill in Schenley Park. Though the

faces of the runners are invisible, Richey is recognizable from

i afar. He’s the one with tape concealing almost every inch of flesh from

the tops of his socks to the bottom of his shorts.

The reason for the bandages is a pair of herniated muscles that af-
flicted Jerry’s legs this summer. The results of the ensuing operation

are questionable. '

-“It really was only semi-suc-
cessful,” explained Jerry, “since
Istill have a lump on my left leg.

I'm not completely satisfied with

the progress that I’ve made.”

Watching Richey labor through
calisthenics, it is easy to under-
stand his dismay. Jerry’s legs are

_held together’ by a potpurri of

bandages, tape, and gauze. that

- laid end to end could probably riv-

al the longevity of the equator. His

, injuries have naturally kept Jerry ; «
from "training as hard as he would _

like. I .

probably won’t hinder Jerry’s ef-
ficiency. What Banner is afraid of
is sending Jerry into competition
prematurely and perhaps aggra-
vating the injury. Richey won't
run in any meet until it is certain
that he is sound.

When this may be,
knows. Not even-Richey.

cellent veterans plus a_couple of
promising freshmen. I don’t think
that they’ll miss me that much.”

Richey’s denial not withstand-
ing, it is difficult to see how the
team can fail to miss him. No
team can lose its star and not be
the worse for it. When the har-

_ riers peek around their shoulders

to see their gimpy-legged leader
limping behind them, they are
sure to be deflated.

It remains to be seen whether
Coach Banner can spark the squad
and keep the harriers rolling un-
til Richey returns. For the pre-
sent, the Panther ace will be too
preoccupied with Ace Bandages to
help the team to victory

Softball Play Resume
In Fraternity League;o
New Format Inserted

Fraternity ‘softball action resumes tonight on the newal 
purpose fields located behind Trees Hall. Asthe league move ~
into its second round of competition, a “necessary” change made"
the intramurals office has changed the format of the tourney frorn’
round-robin to a double—e1imination setup. Leo Bemis, director of In_tI_:a

murals, explained the necessity
of the change.

“Due .to a large demand for
field space from various groups
within the University, the frater-
nity round-robin softball league
will have to adapt to a double—eli-
mination format.” Bemis continu-
ed, “Other groups such as the
dorms, independents and the Pitt
Band have needs for the field space
and areentitled totheir fair share.

As a result of the change, the
results of the first round of play
will stand good. The winners and

losers of those games will be fit ~

into proper bracketing positions. o
