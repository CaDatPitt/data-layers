campus officers from becoming
involved in the work of the city
police.

Joseph Gil, Superintendent of
‘Campus Police, upheld the sus-
pension. He said, “We don’t want
the city officers to interfere in
University problems as they’ did
here at Pitt several years ago. In
exchange for this we don’t involve
ourselves in their problems.”

on Aug. 1. Foster" and Glow-
czewski. operating the sergeant's
radio-equipped car because their
assigned vehicle needed repair,
overheard an “officer in trouble”
call from city police at Louisa and
McKee Sts. They proceeded to the
scene of a gun battle and assisted
in the capture of the suspect, who.
according to Foster, fired on their
vehicle.

Foster said. “It's an officer's

duty to respond to-an ‘officer in‘

trouble call.‘ . . . Two police offi-
cers’ lives were in danger. . . . If
our leaving the campus to assist

anybody . . . to helplprevent the
loss of life is condemned. some-
body's not playing with a full
deck ' —

Superintendent Gil contended

that «Foster and Glowczewski
were “. . . not disciplined for re-

sponding to another officer’s need _

but forviolating a departmental
directive.” According to the gen-
eral directive, response to such
incidents “. . . will be by the spe-
cific instruction of the duty ser-
geant or the desk officer.”

The two officers claimed that
an attempt was made to reach. the
desk, but that this was unsuccess-
ful. “We had to make a decision
on the spot and stand behind it,”
said Foster. "We could have been
arrested if it had been known that
we were in the area and had not
assisted. We're commissioned po-
lice officers. notjust Pitt police."

Gil refuted the argument by
saying that Inspector Haggie of
Oakland Station Four didn’t need
any more help. “There was a roll

call going on at Station Four when
the incidentoccurred. In fact, Jim

 

Haggie started calling off units . ', .7

who received the call.”

Foster and Glowczewski were
disturbed by the University’s de-' ;
cision. Said Foster, “I expected-

the University to overturn this
mindless suspension.” He felt Gil
was shifting his ground and chang-

ing interpretations of the story. "

In one instance Foster cited Gil’s,‘  

official contention to Cherry that
the city officers had not made an

“officers in trouble” call. Gil did _ I l I

admit to this reporter that it was ll

an “officers in trouble” call.

In the official, decision Cherry“ if ill
said, "I must presume they had '

knowledge of the general directive

Therefore, the one day suspen- 

sion is upheld.”_

EA-ZPG Faces Battle  

by RICK EULER

The Environmental Action-Zero
Population Growth (EAZPG)
group here at Pitt is in a struggle
for its very existence.

Tom Bailey, president of Stu-

, dent Government. stated that the

revoking of the EAZPG constitu-

tion will be one of the topics dis-

cussed at the next board meeting
.v-1 5*
tst»SG.

“From what we have been able
to ascertain,” Bailey explained,
“there are only a few members
holding the fort here for the Uni-
versity chapter. It seems they
are becoming more of a Pitts-
burgh chapter than a Pitt chap-
ter.”

Bailey also pointed out that the
University group had had their
charter revoked recently by the
national EAZPG chapter.

.f'Of course. a national charter
is not required for recognition as
a student organization." he added.
"It’s the membership that con-
cerns us.” ‘

 ‘Brady Moore,‘ la-member of the V.

EAZPG steering committee, ar-
gued that the group was declining
because of unusual circumstances
and not because of a lack of inter-
est on the part of the member-
ship.

According to Moore, the prob-
lem began when the SG began en-
forcing the regulation which re-
quires all student organizations to
have a constitution and the elec-
tion of officers.

"I felt that we should comply
with the regulation.” Moore said,
"but Marc I-liller. who was our
coordinator. felt that the constitu-
tion and elections would get in the
way of our operations.”

The constitution was drafted
over Hiller’s objections, however,

‘and it was then, according to

Moore, that the coordinator (H'il-
ler) suddenly stopped holding
meetings of the steering commit-
tee. -‘

Moore added that Hiller also re-
moved all the files and materials

from the EAZPG offices and‘

just on the physical level. You
must deal with the social environ-
ment, the people‘ that live there,
the economic activities going on."

Brambilla created this exhibi-
tion_in order to inform the public
that restoration is not a matter . ‘
just of aesthetics, that it involves
revitalization on social and eco-
nomic levels as well.

He praised the plans currently
under discussion at this Univer-
sity for an interdisciplinary “float-
ing” program in environmental
studies. and said that it could
serve as a model for other univer-
sities in the United States.

Voluntary Participation Urged in Food Service Policy

Meal Ticket Program Questioned

by JAMIE KIRKWOOD
News Editor

At'Tuesday’s meeting of the Boarding Food
Service Sub-Committee. Associate Director of
Housing Donovan Hughes revealed that Joseph Dut-
ton, Vice-Chancellor of Operations. has asked Di-
rector of Housing John Vrana to conduct a study
looking into what other schools are doing in regard
to their meal ticket policy.

Hughes stated, "It is my opinionthat by next
year—before renegotiation of student boarding con-
tracts we will have a positive program of some sem-
blance of voluntary participation.”

Hughes read from a newsletter from College A

Auxiliary Services on campus meal contracts that
“prepayments have been losing ground to food serv-
ice plans that give students more choice.”

Hughes said there are a number of different plans
that will be looked into. One he knew of existing on
other college campuses was a plan for 15 meals per
week. another was a dinner-only plan.

The Food Service Sub-Committee, comprised
of representatives of Women’s, Housing Board,
Men’s~ Dorm Council and two resident assistants
convened for their second meeting of the term with
Szabo Rood Director Kie Haghighi.

Chaired by Hughes, the meeting began with his
explanation to the committee as well as the‘ several

observers present the recent ad in Monday’s issue -

of the Pitt News. ‘ »

Hughes precluded his breakdown of the figure '
"- _ in-the ad with an-. explanation that "the dormitories. ~ V

 '.\ 

  

are considered under the general state code as
auxiliary type concepts.“ -V _

“Money coming into the University goes pure '
and simply for academics . .
not in any sense relate to dormitory food service."

“Our prime source of funds is student fees from’ I

dormitory contracts. All this means is that we stand

alone as far as the state’s money to the University.’-.’\ _-4

The $300 board listed on the non-academic.in-'«.-If
voice does not all go to the -food service. Hughes ex- 

plained. “The University retains 26 per cent of this»
$300 cost per student—or $78—to apply to fixed
costs over which we have no control. (Fixed costs

included debt service, equipment, maintenance of 

facilities, utilities. etc.)

Questioned by one of the observers about an in-.
crease in board next year, Manager Haghighi stat-I
ed, “It will depend‘ upon the outcome of this year’s
operation. If we can operate with the $222 per stu-

dent this year and we can come up with a three per‘ 

cent profit, I see no reason to ask for an increase.”
One financial unknown involved in the cost,

however, neither Hughes nor Haghighi could pin-  .'

point the result of the union negotiations set to be-
gin sometime in November.

One of the points on the agenda was the snack 
bar. “The Snack Bar is losing money,” Hughes said. ,1

He and members of the committee felt the “bar”

might be utilized more if the hours were extended _-

inthe evenings. ’

the group was being dissolved.

Bailey said that when he had
mentioned the dissolution of the
EAZPG group to Hitler. the later
had said that this was agreeable
_to him.

‘Moore complained that Hitler
‘had not informed the members of
EAZPG of what he was doing.

“He’s (Hiller) doing these things

his own responsibility,” he ex-

 Reviewing the situation, Moore

' Bailey, likewise, was /of the
opinion that EAZPG would soon

their constitution is revoked,” he
said, “they could reapply under a‘

Moore concluded by saying that

When asked if the dinner hours, which are low
in customers, could be eliminated, Haghighi thought
not without running a split shift and “the union con-

_ tract doesn’t allow it.” , _

A suggestion to have students run the snack

bar, to “put it upon the students to support it or
close it” met with "favorable response from most

present.

Last year, according to Time

it appeared Nixon was doing some-
thing about crime. ..

During the New Hampshire

now thought to have written the

A White House official sudden-
ly reversed his position‘ and sup-
ported a raise in milk prices.
(This is worth about 1/2 billion to
the dairy industry.) After this
happened. a dairy organization
donated $300,000 to the GOP fund
raising committee.

The President refused to reveal
the names of contributors that
donated $10 million to a secret
campaign fund.

Five members of the Commit-
tee to Re—elect the President were
found removing earlier placed
"bugs" in the Democratic~Na-
tional Headquarters.

The Department of Agriculture
concealed "valuable information
from farmers at the same time
they quietly passed it on to big
"business speculators. Thus, the
farmer lost money while the large
businesses made millions.

This author can not hold Mr.
Nixon directly responsible for all

these incidents. Yet, one wonders '

what his involvement was. Cer-
tainly he was at least indirectly
involved in that he appointed
these government officials. And
as their President, he is their boss.
To those readers who believe the
integrity of 'used car salesman

to readers that believe there is

A Column and AHalf 

by JOHN METCALFE

An attempt is being made to solve the transportation hassles of
commuting students with motor pools. The idea is simple and elegant.
and it looks as if it should work. But it probably won’t.

Some students are unwilling to commit themselves to passing a
specific point at an appointed time every day. Others are inclined
to be forgetful, and might strand their passengers for long waits on
grim street corners. But the real flaw in the car-pool plan isthat it
depends on students. few of whom begin classes at the same time-
every day. The average student would probably need at least two
drivers to manage the trick of getting to school. Some. like me. would
require three. ~

A simpler solution does exist, and would be fairly easy and cheap

to implement. It is a slight elaboration on hitchhiking.

Hitchhikingin the city was always a handy way to get around.
Lately. since it’s gotten so popular. the only difficulty is in find-
ing a corner that isn’t already decorated with araised thumb. Get-
ting to Pitt is fairly simple; a large fraction of the traffic in the city
seems to pass through Oakland. It rarely takes me more than one
ride to get here; once in a long while as many as three. But getting

home is another trip altogether.

When I raise my thumb and a driver stops. some infonmation
is exchanged. but not enough. He knows I want a ride. but not where
I want to go. I know he‘s willing to help me along. but not where‘

he's going.

(I will continue to call the driver “he”. The~.ladies hardly

ever stop for my thumb. Perhaps they’re not liberated.)

Here comes the proposal.

I suggest that somewhere on campus. possibly in front of the
Hillman Library or along the driveways at both ends of the Student
Unionﬁa series of signs be posted. They would indicate general

areas of the city, with emphasis on the sections with the h1gheststu- 

dent concentrations.

(These would be easy- to identify in a computerized institu-



tion. Just ask the computer for a breakdown of the student popula-

tion by zip-code areas. )

Drivers would know where prospective passengers wanted to go,
and students could solicit rides in a dignified and restful manner, .
without the athletic waving and cursing the current system de-

mands.

There might be a few quibbles from the police or from the
University Administration. The whole thing might be technically

illegal.

But it could hardly be more dangerous than free-style hitching.
and it would certainly be more convenient for all concerned.

  Letters To

Dear Sir:

University of Pittsburgh dorm
residents are the most tasteless
people I have ever met.

If they were _not. they would
have long ago ceased to abide by
the atrocities committed daily by
Szabo Foods in the dorm cafe-

-terias. In the recent Pitt News

article, a member of the Pitt
Tenant Union was quoted‘ as de-
scribing the food service as “hor-
rendous"; I would say a more
earthy term. namely “disgusting.”
is better applied. The obvious con-

tempt which the management of I

Szabo has for the students it serves
ought ‘to have inspired riots in
the cafeteria within a week after

. Szabo began operation's—if those

eating there had any taste.

The reason for this contempt
is also obvious: since Szabo is
assured of a "captive clientele"
by virtue of the present unpar-
alleled-in-Pittsburgh policy ' of
compulsory meal tickets, why
should itattempt to please?

The tastelessness of Szabo's
clientele is further evident in the
fact that they have not jumped
upon the best opportunity yet to
do something about it. On Octo-
ber 9 the Pitt News published an
article stating that two members
of the Pitt Tenants‘ Union were
circulating a petition which. if
it could acquite "600 signatures.
could be placed on a student
referendum. The body of this
petition is:

"Resolved that the Student Gov-
ernment Board make known to
the University administration and
seek to implement the policy that
no student living in University
residence halls shall be compelled
to purchase a meal ticket as- part
of the University housing contract;
and that participation in any meal
plan be at the individual option
of each student.”' V

petition. I have only heard one
express interest in getting off "
her backside and finding that pe-

tition to sign it.

A possible reason for this is
that it was not made clear in the
article where to locate the peti-
tion. So I will make it clear. The
petition is available in the offices
of the Pitt Tenants’ Union, 306

Dear Sir:

Last week, I receivedan inter-
esting communication from an or-
ganization calling itself "Demo- ,
crats for Nixon.” It contained a-
few choice tidbits of informa-
tion and a return envelope, the
purpose of which was to mail a
contribution to the sponsors.

My heartstrings had been pluck-
ed and I was hard pressed to
decide what would be an appro-
priate amount to contribute. Fin-
ally, I hit upon atfanswer. --

I went to the receptacle that I
kept for such purposes and, from
it. placed an oleo wrapper, some
chicken bones and peels from

the envelope. '

An Open Letter

To The Chancellor

Dear Dr. Posvar.

As students at this University.
we feel that we are entitled to ade-
quate police protection. However.
recent decisions seemed aimed at
systematically denying us the
safety that we expect and pay for
as members of the University
family.

Recent weeks have shown a
marked increase in violent crimes
against students on the Oakland
campus. Dozens of students have
been raped. assaulted, and robbed
in all parts of the campus at all
times of the day and night.

While this has been going on,
the management of the Campus
Police has been directing its
priorities to guarding buildings in-
stead of people. Many thousands
of dollars are being diverted to a
closed circuit television system
while patrol beats remain unfill-
ed and officers areforced to work
50-60 hours per week because new
officers that are badly needed

-have not been hired.

A move is underway to remove
officers from Hillman Library. the

Quad, and Schenley Hall when it
has been proven that these offi-
cers are desperately needed.

When members of this year’s
senior class were freshman. Pitt
was making national news as 30
assaults occurred during the first
Friday evening of the term. At
this time, a positive commitment
was made toward establishing a
professional police department to
protect the University commun-
ity. Now it seems that the Univer-
sity is no longer willing to pro-
tect its students.

The management of the Campus
Police has been playing office po-
litics with our health and safety.
We expect that you as Chancellor
of the Unversity will take imme-
diate and direct steps to guaran-
tee our safety.

Sincerely.
The Legal
Awareness Committee

"Students concerned with the wel-

Project Light

Project Light, which operates
at the Western Pennsylvania
School for the blind, has volun-

 teers working in three capacities;
 as classroom aides during the day,

as companions on a one-to-one
basis with handicapped students,
and as recreational aides for the

tion.
Individuals involved as ‘class-

als may take students .out of the
institution to movies, picnics and
athletic events.

Some Pitt students also serve as
tutors and readers for blind indi-
viduals having particular prob-
lems with their studies.

Sessler claims that the Pitt
participants gain an understand-
ing of blind people as human be-
ings through “a learning and

‘lasting friendship with blind in-

dividuals.”
Project Old People

Project Old People (POP) is
the newest of the YMCA’s pro-
jects, and is still in the organi-
zational stage. Eileen Stern, POP’s
coordinator, says that student vol-
unteers in the project will visit
elderly individuals in the Harriet
Tubman terrace apartment com-
plex in East Liberty.

“There is" no planning for the
old people there," Stern said.
“and many of these people just
sitalone in their rooms with no
one to talk to. Some of them are
afraid to go to the store alone.
and many have no friends or
family.“

~Stern emphasized that volun-
teers in the program will not
encourage the elderly individu-.5

 

als to become dependent on them.
but rather encourage them to par-
ticipate in activities with other
residents of the Terrace.

Early next year another organi-
zation, Vintage Inc., hopes to
utilize the facilities of the East
End Christian Church (home of
the Free Clinic) as a recreation
center for the elderly residents
of the area. POP hopes to tie in
with this organization in provid-
ing lasting programs.

"At this time we have only six
volunteers,” Stern said, "but as
the project gets moving more
are expected.“

"Working with old people
doesn’t have the glamor of work-
ing with kids. but old people are
a fantastic resource that is not
being touched." Stern remarked.

Project Juvenile Court

The main challenge of Project
Juvenile Court is developing inter-
personal relationships with delin-
quents who are likely to be in the
institution for only two weeks be-
fore being sentout to other correc-
tional facilities.

“Many students are hesitant to
participate in the project because

have shown me that the kids
are extremely polite,” remarked
Jan Galley, coordinator of the pro-
ject. . V

Most of the individuals passing
through Pittsburgh‘s juvenile
court are between eight and eight-
een years of ag_e. '

"October is usually -the biggest
month at the court. probably be-
cause the summer is over and
the kids have had one month to
get bored with school." Galley
added. '

. Pitt volunteers serve as tutors,
work in the arts and crafts pro-
gram, the physical education pro-
gram and at the Friday night
Coffeehouse. Volunteers over 21
years of age who have received
special training are permitted to
take the children out for outings.

A unique newspaper, J. C. Rapper
is produced under the direction
of Y volunteers and serves to pub-
lish articles and editorials written
by individuals committed to the
court. "Our Juvenile Court was’
the first in the country to insti-

_ tute such a paper,” Galley noted.

“A lot of these kids have been
rejected by their families and they
need to know that someone cares,”
Galley remarked. Galley added
that Pittsburgh's Juvenile_ Court
is very progressive and that the
administrators have been cooper-
ative with the volunteers from
project Juvenile Court.

_i Project Prison

Students working in the YMCA
Prison Project are attempting to
contribute meaningful additions
to the" existing program at the
State Correctional Institute of
Pittsburgh. They have defined
three goals; to give inmates some-
thing to do with their idle time,

to improve communication be-
tween the inmates and the so-
ciety and to improve communi-
cation between the public and the
administrators of the prison sys-
tem.

Several students working on the
project are using it as field work
for the new course entitled “Cor-
rections in a Free Societyj’ taught
by Jack Karns, at Pitt.

The YMCA has proposed visits
by several university organiza-
tions to the prison including the
Studio Theater, The Chess Club.
and the Debating Team.

Walt Grady. Coordinator of the
Prison Project, says that inmate-
administrator—student discussion
groups and a mail correspond-
ence program are also being or-
ganized. He is also noted that
plans are being made to take stu-
dents and interested individuals

 

/

into the prison for tours. in an

-effort to increase the rationality

and reduce the
towards Community
Centers in the future.

  Virtuosic Techniques

Permeate Cello Recital

by ANDREW J. SOPKO
Arts Editor

The mellow tones of the cello
have always been the perfect
route to tranquil and unprepos-
sessing musicimaking in the con-
cert'.. hall and many of us /were
very successfully carried along that
route this past Tuesday when
Vsevolod Lezhnev, associate cell-
ist of the Pittsburgh Symphony
presented a recital of grand and
ambitious proportions at the Frick
Auditorium.

In collaboration with pianist
Herman Godes of West Virginia
University. Lezhnev offered a pot-
pourri of works spanning the reper-
toire of the past and the present.
Opening with the energetic Opus
Six Sonata of Samuel Barber, he

' continued with major composi-
tions of Bach. Tchaikovsky. and
Rachmaninoff.

A suite for solo violincello of
J.S. Bach threw Lezhnev into the
solo spotlight with admirable re-

‘ sults. Although somewhat mechan-

ical in his approach during the
course of the work’s virtuosic
technicalities, his tone was pure

1"! and steady and his technique a

cut above that of many first chair-
men whom we have had the op-
portunity of hearing in recent
times. There were admittedly
errors, but these paled in com-
parison to the difficulties of the
composition. ' -
For our Romanticists. the Tchai-
kovsky Variations on a Rococo
Theme followed, one of those ter-
ribly unbalanced compositions
which has become a perennial
charmer in pleasing audiences.
One hardly jumps at the pros-
pects of hearing an orchestral
reduction from the keyboard, but
that was our inevitable fate with
the Tchaikovsky and it resultingly

/‘xilacked much of its character with



1'!‘

the absence of string accompani-
ment.

Our man at the keyboard show-
ed constant concern for his fellow
musician during the evening. Most
sensitive at the pianoforte. Mr.
Godes was almost too careful at
times and as a result. lacked the
bravaura that was often required
during climactic moments. The
collaboration of the two musi-
cians was fairly reasonable through-
out but it was also evident that
they were in need of more prac-
tice together in order to bring off
certain passages. A

Following the interval came the

"rarity of the evening—The Rach-

maninoff G minor Sonata, a work
which has not been heard around
here for years. In these days
when Rachmaninoff’s music is
hardly in vogue, this sonata came
as a refreshing example of what
we have missed during those rep-
etitious performances of certain '
preludes and concerti from the
twentieth century master’s pen.
Needless to say, we ‘were most
grateful to hear this neglected
sonata and may it not be too ter-
ribly long before we hear it
again.

The major complaint of this pro-
gram must center around its length,
too many works can very easily
satiatellisteners to the point where
a good concert can be ruined.
Luckily, however, the length
of Tuesday’s program did not cause
many in the audience to depart
before its conclusion.

While we all felt that the list
of compositions needed shortened
by one or two numbers, we also
felt that, all in all the entire "pro-
gram was one of the more reward-
ing experiences of the present

. season. A great amount of music

was offered and a wealth of aes-
thetic pleasure was its principal
consequence.-

‘Yes’ Display Positive Effort

by BARBARA GERAUD
I first fell in love with Yes about

a year ago—back when "Your Move”

was riding the top of the pop
charts. Crosby & Company couldn’t
make up their minds what they
were going to do. and nobody was
putting out anything that had
those beautiful harmonies to send
chills up and down the spine.

Then this song came along.
Here was a group that wasn't
afraid to put a bunch of "dit-dit‘s"
in the middle of a song, or to use
"Alice in Wonderland”—type imag-

'e_s. They managed to sound like

Emerson Lake & Palmer as well
as the CSN&Y entourage. yet with
that indefinable something that
made them different. T

They were five: Jon Anderson
on vocals. Chris Squire on bass.
Steve Howe on guitar. Tony Kay

- on piano and moog and Bill Bru-

ford on Drums. Eddie Offord p_ro-
duced them—he’s the engineer and
associate producer for ELP_. which
explains much of the similarity in
sounds.

"Exit Tony Ka_ye. Enter Rick Wake-
man. And begin new dimensions
in music for Yes. “We are moving"
into what I can only describe as
orchestral rock,” Wakeman said.
“Every bar is thought out when the
song is formulated. Adrenaline
bursts of on-the-spot improvisa-
tion are replaced by musical blue-
prints drawn in advance.”

So there came Fragile—like a mon-
ument erected .to remind all of

the tenuous and precarious rela-

tionship that makes up a musical

partnership. “It came,” said Bill

Bruford, “out of talking at re-

hearsal one day about Tony and

the people that come and go in

the band. It never ceases to amaze

me that we are still here and we’re

all playing at the same time and

that some of us have been for three
and a half years.”

  THE PARTY  
  CANDIDATE.  

From one beer lover to another.

THE STROH BREWEQY COMPANY, DETROIT, MICHIGAN 482.26

But Bruford‘s words would prove
to be prophetic. Fragile ties in
the group have led them Close to
the Edge. and Bruford is now gone.
replaced by Alan White. But be-
fore he left. he helped to create
what is possibly the group’s best
album yet. i . .

There is a cinematic quality in
side one. which is the title side.
Instead of being boring, as is the
case with so many extended pieces.
I found myself wishing it could
go on for another side or two.

The main melody from the piece
is extremely attractive~Jon sings
in his usual unassuming stylé. hov-
ering on the brink of uncertainty.
He is counterpointed by Chris
Squire’s bass—adding another
melody line without losing ‘sight

. of the basic functionof the bass

as a rhythm instrument.

"I Get Up. I Get Down." sounds
like it was recorded for one of the
1940‘s monster movies—a very
eerie church-organ. that actually
was recorded in a local cathed-
ral.

A great addition is Rick Wake-
man’s Mellotron. It gives him the
ability to add the sweep of an or-
chestra to the rest of the band,
while putting in sounds some
orchestra instruments can’t make. ‘
It really comes to the fore on

side two—the “And You And I”
suite, another piece rich in tone-
colors. Each theme links logical-
ly, and the heavy use of over-
dubbing manages to avoid giv-
ing too artificial a flavor.

The final piece. "Siberian
Khatru." sounds like there’s a
few too many tracks left in the
mix. but it's another thought-
provoking piece that includes a
reprise of an earlier vocal phrase.
merging and blending in the final
bars in a way that is quite
brilliant. The final resolve sounds
quite Stravinsky-influenced in its
"machine-like violence. I

Where they can go from here
is a moot point. Many think they
have done it all as far as studio
perfection is concerned—"live" be-
ing the only way to go. We’ll get
to see when they arrivein Pitts-
burgh on November’ 7. Pat Di-
Cesare is bringing them in for _
one show only that night at The

through a better-than-average lo-
cal band called Sassafras, for-
merly the Fenways and the Rack-
et Squad, the last-minute replace-
ment, for the feature attraction.

After a brief intermission, lights
went out, and onstage pranced‘
Rockette Morton. donned in a
blazing blue mod-styled suit.
strumming his double-neck bass-
rhythm axe. Following him came
lead guitarist Zoot Horn Rollo.
and finally bassist Eel Fingerling
and drummer Ed Marimba. They
finished their number. and then
out walked Captain Beefheart.
alias Don Van Vliet. ‘

The Captain. attired in a black
leather jacket. approached the
mike and began shouting his pa-
tented blues incantations. as he
and the band played music from
previous albums. They did four
songs. after which the stage lights
faded. and the musicians depart-
ed.

Captain Beefhea rt returned,
wrapped in a light blue cloak, a
garment which has become a
trademark for him. During this
segment, Vliet showed off his vo-
cal dynamics, proving that his
voice can stand up without sup-
port from drums and guitars.

Singing a tale .of an “Old Black

I Snake,” Beefheart sang in octaves

ranging from high frequency also
to ultra low baritone.

Rejoined by the band. he contin-
ued his high-driving blues format.
wahling eigher his blues harp. or
his chromatic harmonica. Per-
forming material from Spotlight
Kid, their last release, the group
played songs such as “Click
Clack" and "I'm Gonna Booglar-
ize You Baby.” in their own uni-
que brand of boogie-woogie blues.

All but one of the band once’

again cleared the stage, and the
spotlight was on the lead guitarist.

s Energized Evening

Racing his fingers up and down
the frets, Zoot Horn Rollo bril-
liantly played a baroque oriented
composition, entitled "One Red
Rose Thatl Mean."

Captain Beefheart reentered _
and, in dialogue with Rollo, chat-
ed verses of poetry, exchanging
lines of verbalizations for guitar
riffs. What would have been an
otherwise flawless performance,
unfortunately was spoiled as Beef-
heart held the mike too close to
his mouth which made his words
difficult to understand.

’After a third set, followed by
pleas for an encore, the musi-
cians launched a finale" similar to
the way their act had commenced."
Rockette Morton led the proces-
sion, preceding Rollo, Eel Finger-
lin, and Ed Marimba. Just as
Beefheart can vocalize without in-
strumental accompaniment. the
Magic Band demonstrated that
they are more than a back-up
group. Together they excitedithe
audience with eccentric, high-en—_
ergizing rock. A

Beefheart reappeared and con-
cluded with the. classic “Mirror
Man,” dominated with vigorous
harp blowing. “Get up, get up!”
The Captain commanded his audi-
_ ence, and get up they all did, danc-
ing and shaking madly in their
places. ~

Admittedly, the concert was
marred by the absence- of Dr.
John. But the efforts of Captain
Beefheart and company made the
evening rewarding in spite of it.

The Bertone-designed car on

this page has all the style and grace

less than those others.

A But don’t let that mislead you—
the Fiat 850 Spider above is pure,

wouldn’t have it any other way. And
neither would Fiat. _

For example, Fiat is the world’s I

one in the 850 is a beauty. It winds up
all the way to 6,500 rpm before
hitting red (and while we’re on the

everything else you’d expect to ﬁnd

fully-synched transmission, front

As for the interior, Road & '

All of this in the lowest-priced

saving money, too, because the

Associated Sports Editor

The Panther gridders are still
prowling around for their first
victory of the '72 season and they
hope to correct this situation by
victimizing the Boston College
Eagles tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. at
Pitt Stadium.

Pitt‘s head football coach Carl
DePasqua feels the Panthers
gained some maturity in last
week’s 42-16 loss to Notre Dame.

‘'1 don‘t think that score against
Notre Dame was indicative of
the effort of our squad (Pitt was
only behind 21-8 going into the
fourth quarter)/," commented
DePasqua. "1 was pleased with
the overall effort. and I think
maybe our squad grew up a little
bit.”

Cats’ underrated opponents tomor-
row is certainly not indicative of
their potential this year.

All three of the games Boston
College dropped were tough loss-
es. They were downed by the
scores of 10-0 to Tulane. 13-9 to
Air Force and 27-20 to the Mid-
shipmen of Navy. Pitt also played

V  Friday,

"Boston College gave a good
football game to two teams that

1 beat us by large scores." said De-

Pasqua. "They‘re a good football
team with a lot of talent. They‘re
sound. have good speed. and do
everything pretty well."

The Eagles’ football mentor
Joe Yukica is less enthusiastic
about his team’s performance so
far this season.

"I’m pleased with the effort
of the team.“ Yukica related.
"But I can‘t be pleased with the
most important criterion. the wins
and the losses.

"Neither the offense nor the
defense have played particu-
larly well," he continued. "The
defense has played two fine foot-
ball games totally and the of-
fense has been on and off—they
have not been score producing
except in one game (a 49-27 vic-
tory over Temple )."

Some bright spots do exist,
however, on both the BC offen-
sive and defensive units.

Junior quarterback Gary Mar-
angi has proved to be a good
all-around pilot for the Eagles. :

"Gary has had‘ his tough days
and he has had some plays which
he wishes he could do over." stated

/ Yukica. “But he has good leader-

faction of Pitt alumni working very hard to improve the tan-'

That would be the new locker room presently being con-

The group has named themselves the Rebounders to coin-
memorate the turn around of the Pitt basketball program in the
last four years. The whole idea’ came about when athletic di-
rector. Casmir Myslinski was approached about specific money.
The group was told that if they had the money. they could go
ahead, not before. » ' 1

A minimal contribution of $25 dollars would not only make
a constituent a member of the Rebounders, but i.t would also
make him a Golden Panther for one year. t

-The group is really going all out to. make this a success.
Also, they are preparing to reap some benefits from their
contributions.

The Rebounders will hold a buffet dinner, have a block
of seats to give them distinction, and will also have a parking
discount rate available for them for every home game.

“The whole idea of the thing is to put some enthusiasm

ginto Pitt Basketball. Bairel was quoted as saying at one of the.

meetings. “When. the players hit thefloor the pep band will
be playing, thecrowd will get excited and the Players will
be ready to go." 1

The locker room facility will cost in the neighborhood of
$5,000 a_nd will be one of the finest to be found, with wall-to:
wall carpeting and wooden lockers. It is also more advantage-
ous to the team in that it will be bigger and house all basket-
ball players. v

Anyone interested in becoming a part of this venture
should’ make a $25 check payable to the: University of Pitts-
burgh «Basketball». and send it to Sciullo at 1706 Law and
Finance Building. Scullo will in turn give it to the Panther
Foundation where it can be had when it is needed.

“Great pass threat”

Ohio ‘International’ Test   

_ by BART MACK

After facingthe University of Akron. itcould
be expected that the Pitt soccer team has had their
Illl of international. players. .The booters still
get another taste of the international flair. how-

« ever, when they travel back into Ohio to meet

Cleveland State. -

Cleveland has already lost two games this
season. but those two games came against, per-
haps, the best colleges in the nation. Howard Uni-
versity and St. Louis University are the only teams
able to down Cleveland so far and if they aren't
the two top colleges this year. .they were certainly
the best last season.

’ Howard, the 1971 NCAA champions, could man-
age only a 3-0 win over Cleveland and that came
after the two/clubs battled for 65 minutes in a
scoreless tie. St. Louis runnerup to Howard. beat

‘ the Ohioans. 4-1, but two of their goals came on

penalty kicks that were called in the second half.
Cleveland boasts an overall record of 4-2, post-

ing victories over Toledo, Wright St., Ashland, Il- *

linois (Chicago). Pitt’s record to date is 3-2-1.
The booters have dropped a pair of important
games to Temple and Akron and played to a tie

easy time of it, beating Grove City. 5-1.. It was

The game is an important one for Cleveland

lost two games, those losses came against the two,

Edger l-loopers Begin

Pitt basketball coach Buzz Ptidl welcomed 18
players to the opening of basketball training on Mon-
day. He will have about six weeks to grind them

into a coherent unit.

There will be six newcomers to Pitt basketball
this season. all but one of whom is a freshman. The
one who is not a freshman, six-ten Lucius Keese-—a
junior college transfer from St. Peterlsburg. . Fla.
Keese is expected to be a big help to the varsity.

Pitt fans will get a chance to sneak-preview the
team on Wednesday night. Nov. 15. when the team

will play an intra-squad game at 8.

The game will be free to all Pitt students, but
there will be a charge of $1 for all non-students.

The opening game of the season will be two
weeks later, on Nov. 29, when Pitt plays host to Mt.
Union College at the Field House.

Five lettermen will be returning from a squad

that went 12 and

12 a year ago. These include All-

American candidate Billy Knight, Carl Morris. Bill
Sulkowski, Mickey Martin. and Ken Viiagoner.

Freshman recruits include guards Tom Rich-
ards and Keith Starr, as well as forwards Mark
Disco, John Endsley, and Greg McBride.

Freshmen will be eligible to play on the varsity

Most students are aware of the fact that they pay a twelve dollar activities fee, and that.
the allocations committee handles the money given to Pitt organizations. But there are many
people and processes involved before the first step, the collection of fees, reaches the last’
step, the allocation of money to each organization.

J The Allocations "Committee is composed of eight
lent economic background, and some have past experience with the Allocations Committee.

This year, over 70 organizations submitted budgets to the Allocations Committee. All of
these organizations have an advisor, and keep in close.touch with a member of the Alloca-
tions Committee. Each presented budget is reviewed by the committee. Most organizations
receive less allocated money than requested. This information is then passed on to the Stud-
ent Government. The Board, which is composed of students, has the final decision on all al-
locations. Thus, the students of this university, through representation, completely control
how their activities fee is spent.

However, this power given to the students is soon to be tested. A referendum concern-
ing this fee is approaching in November. Each student should be aware of the fact that their
money is handled responsibly, and that it contributes greatly to the diversity of the uni-

eople. These students have an excel-

If you vote “yes” to retain the activities fee, you are voting for student control of al-
locations and the survival of Pitt’s organizations and clubs. If you vote “no” at the fee ref-
erendum, who knows what there will be to do at Pitt next year?

Academically Too

Schurko.

_ by LYNN HARRIS
Sitting in a chair drinking tea. Bob Schurko.
a member of our "quality” cross country team is
a soft spoken. easy going person.
A 1971 graduate of Bethel Park High School.

Schurko has been running since seventh grade. In-.

fluenced by his older brother Michael Schurko.
a former outstanding cross country runner at Pitt.
Bob Schurko ran the half mile till he hit high
school. In ninth grade he started running the mile.

Being number one man on the Bethel Park
team in his senior year. Schurko decided to stay
in the Pittsburgh area to go to college. Turning
down Brown and Yale to come to the University.

- Schurko thinks he made the right decision. He is
happy here, both academically and athletically.

Knowing what he was getting into Schurko “fig-
ured collegiate running would be hard.”

“I have no real complaints." commented Schur-
ko. “I like the way were trained and I like the
guys on the team.

"I’d like to do better this season.” comment-
ed Schurko on his performance thus far this sea-
son.

Worried about his low draft number and his
physical which was last.Thursday, the day before
the West Virginia meet, and add to that the virus

_ge contacted along with the_ rest of the team,
one has a very preoccupied young man.

“I’m disappointed with the team’s perform-

ance so far." he said. “But things are on the up-

.-swing. We have a young team, but a quality
team.

Happy Afh ele  

"We had a lot against us. the barrier stated.
referring to the circulating virus. and injuries
"We’re about due for some good running.

“Tuesday we had our best workout as a team
ever. If we run what we’re capable of, we’ll be
up there in the Eastern’s,” he commented.

Only one change has been made in training

and that is the 6:45 workouts. They've been cut.
The team still runs everyday at 4:00 p.m. on their

7 course in Schenley Park.

-Sleeping in. the mornings now. but running
when he can.-especially on weekends. Schurko
feels it was a good idea to get rid of the 6:45.
practice. It is especially with -so many of the run-
ners worn down from the virus. .

Obtaining a Bachelor of Arts in Physics and
then going on to graduate school in business ad-
ministration are Schurko’s future plans.

.“I’d like to keep running to stay in good phy-
sical condition,” he commented, "but I‘m not in-
terested in competitive running or.coaching after
college." - V

Speaking of the Canesius Relays, an invita-
tional meet in which about 20 schools compete
on an almost perfectly flat four and one half mile

. course, Schurko thinks Pitt can win.

“Winning the Invitational last year the only
competition we face is Lehigh and possibly Alle-
gheny Community College,” the barrier stated.

With Bob Schurko "running is like a job he
does it everyday, and enjoys it!” To be running
for eight years he would have to like it.
