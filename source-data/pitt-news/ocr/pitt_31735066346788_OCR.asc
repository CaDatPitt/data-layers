When the students hand in their

“The Book Exchange will be
only as good as the students make
it,” stated Miss Kimel. “A lot of
work has been put into the plan-

$‘Additional Study’
Asked For Proposal

Dr. Alan C. Rankin, assistant chancellor for Student and

General Affairs, has released a staternent returning Richard _ »

Sobota’s alcohol proposal to the “Student Government for
additional study and consideration.” '
“SG is to be commended for the careful and serious study _

‘It is , noted,” he continued,
“that SG approved this recom-
mendation by a vote of 17 to one.
H o w e v e r, the Interfraternity
Council vote was only 16 to 12 in
favor of the proposal and the Ex-
ecutive Committee of the ‘IFC
‘voted four/to one against the pro-
posal.” _

“In View of the clear lack of
consensus on this subject, the re-
sponsibility such a plan would im-
pose upon a group which has
strong reservations about assum-
ing such responsibility, and the
resulting opinion that the subject
is not a pressing one, the recom-
mendations are referred back to
the SG.” '

Commenting on the proposal
itself, Dr. Rankin further Stated
that, “this study has promoted
an understanding of the prob-
lems and responsibilities which
would accompany a major
change in a long standing tra-
dition at Pitt if the recommen-
dations of SG were to be ap-

proved.”
Summarizing the proposal, Dr.
Rankin’s statement notec. that

“The recommendations of the SG
have been studied carefully,” and
“In brief, they limit the use of
alcoholic beverages to fraternities
oﬁicially recognized by the Uni-
versity.

‘As stated in the Pitt News of
April 9, IF accepted the proposal
only after Sobota hadassured the
body that SG had approved a
proposal extending the drinking
privileges to the rest of the stu-
dent body, and not just to the
fraternities. According to Dr.
Rankin’s statement, however, this

was never passed.

Events 

Calendar

R I ' id
The Student Affairs Com-
mittee extended official Uni-

versity recognition to threeje

campus organizations and in-
itiated revitalization of the

University Major Events Cal- 

endar at their meeting last Tues-‘
day.

Pitt Political Forum, Americans
for Democratic Action and the So-
ciety for Conservative Studies
were reviewed and their petitions
for recognition accepted. Two of
these groups, however, were rec-
ognized on a conditional basis.

Along with approval of the‘
Americans for Democratic Action
Went the stipulation that no ele-

ment of their national constitu-

tion may contravene University
policy. The Committee also recom-
mended that the Society for Con".
servative Studies organize appoint-
merit of its officers along demo-
cratic lines. D - "
Sets Up Calendar

If‘ response to student com-
plaints that scheduling of non-
academic campus events has caused
conflicts during the past year, the
Student Affairs Committee has set’
up_a central Major Events Calen-
dar under the direction of Larry

Heller, Student Union program co- V

ordinator.

Purpose of the calendar, ‘ac-
cording to Heller, is merely to
provide a long-range forecast of
all major University events. The
Calendar Committee, he em-
Dhasized, “does not have the
power to cancel or postpone any
activity or event.”

A1_1 groups planning events of a
major nature have been urged by
Heller to obtain application cards
In the Student Union Office, fill
them out, and return them by
May 1.

Criteria for a major event are
available in the Student Union Of-
fice.

REGISTRATION 1

The office of the school of
Liberal Arts has announced that
registration kits are now avail-
able in the deans’ offices of the

Senate Ends Sessions

By JOSEY GROSSMAN ‘ . ,
At the last SG meeting of the winter trimester, the senate
discussed Dr. Rankin’s comment on the Alcohol Commit-
tee’s proposal. Fred S. Robi.e, executive secretary of Alumni

Council, also acquainted the
his office. '
Vice-president Judy Diethorn
that Dr. Rankin
has referred the Alcohol Commit-
te_e’s proposal back to SG for
further study and‘ consideration.
“He felt that there was a lack of
consensus among the fraternities

because of the 16-12 vote in IF

and the 4-1 opposition in their
executive council. Since the pro-

‘ posal directly affects the frater-

nities and since the matter is not

,pressing, he suggested that fur-

ther examination might be bene-
ﬁcial,” Miss Diethorn concluded.

“I’ve always favored this pro-
posal,” President Tom Qlofson
commented,” and felt that the fra-
ternities could take on this re-

, sponsibility. However, Dr. Rankin

has made a fair and valid de-
cision. He’s not saying that he is

‘opposed, to drinking on campus,

-only that the frats are the only
people who will be drinking and
‘there doesn’t seem to be en-
ough support from them.”

Rich Sobota, chairman of the
Alcohol -Committee, is drawing up
an addition to the proposal --
that the privilege be exterded. to
include University-wide events.
Olofson said, “Rich should submit
this at our next meeting, the ﬁrst

of. the spring trimester. If he does

and we pass it, it will go to Dr.
Rankin. If he does not submit it,
we will have to take car. of the
matter in some otherlway.’

Robie outlined the organiza-
tion and primary functions of
the Alumni Council to the sen-
ate. , “Our only purpose,” he
said, “is the further higher edu-
cation, making it better for
training the leaders of tomor-
row.” The ofﬁce’s most active
function has been its Schools,
and -Scholarship Committee
which contacts and assists pros-
pective students.

The senate decided to conduct
Pa-rent’s Weekend next year since

'AWS reported that “it was a

little too big for them tohandle
this year.” In addition, Ruthie
Maguire was voted chairman of
Kiski Day, and the senators voted
on a_ preferential ballot of 30

nominations for alumni represen-

tatives.

Book Exchange

(Covnﬁnued norm Page 1)

books are sold during the ex-
change. .

Books for required courses are
in more demand than those for
electives. “The freshmen, espe-
cially, should think of leaving
their books with the exchange,”
said Miss Kimel. “Most of their
courses, such as English compo-
sition, are compulsory and thei
books will be needed.” ’

During the iii-st week in Sep-
tember Miss Kimel will an-
nounce a place for the students
to bring their credit slips and
receive either the money or the
unsold books.

“The main purpose of the ex-

change is to alleviate the cost of
new books and if students don't
participate it cannot be a success,"
Miss Kirnel again stressed.

CRAM COURSE NO. 2: BIOLOGY

The grisly shadow of ﬁnal exams looms over us, so today in
this column instead of merry quips and homely saws, you will
ﬁnd lmrd facts e~qul(3l{ cram courses to help you through’ the.
ordeal ahead.

Last week I gave you a rapid survey of Modern European
History. Now let. us turn to Biology. , —

Biolo,r.>;y is divided into several phyla, or classes. First is
the protozoa, or onc~celled animal. All life stems from the one-
ccllctil zmimal. Over a space of millions of years, life slowly
evolved until today we have animals with as many as 12 cells.
Some larger mam'mals claim they have 14 to 16 cells, but you
know how larger n'launna.ls lie.

The second class of animals is the periphcra ~—a shadowy

(\zltego1'y that borders often on the vc.getable. Take, for example,
the sp-onaje. The sponge is deﬁnitely an .-mi1‘nal.. The vvashcloth,
on the other hand, ‘is deﬁnitely not.
‘ Next we come to the arthropoda, or inscl:t;-r. Most people,
of c()ur>"e, ﬁnd i.nsects fairly repulsive» and yet, if one will but
look, there is exquisite beauty in the insect world. Who does
not remember the lovely insect poems of William Cullcxi
Si.g:l.l’o(>s ——such enchanting lyrics as T'um.bl'£ng Along with the
’1'urmbl2'rng T-u:rr2.blcbug. Fly Gently, Sweet Aph-id, and Ghats lily
Mot"/mr ’l’a:uglat Me. Mr. Sigaioos has been inactive ‘since the
invent:-ion of DDT.

Our next category is the mollusca~~lobsters, shrimp, and
the like. l'.obstcrs are generally found under rocky projections.
on the ocean bottom. ‘Shrimp are gcneially found in a circle
around a small bowl containing‘ cocktail sauce. Marlboro Cig-
arettes are ,9;enera.ll_v found at any tobacco counter or vending,
niacin no.

What liave Mu1‘ll)ol'o ()‘igareti.cs got to do with b.iolog'y?
Well. actually, not very much. It must be remembered, how-
ever, that the makers of l\{larlboro pay me for writing this
column, and they are inclined to get surly if I fail to inention.
their product. ‘

Mind you, I enjoy singing the praises of l\“lu.rlboro~-and
so will you once you try that ﬂa'vorl’ul tobacco, that fine ﬁlter
which lets the ﬂavor come th.rou.gh undiminishcd. It is a. great
pleasure to smoke Marlboros and a great pleasure to write
about them, but soulctilnes, I must confess, I ﬁnd it a. bit

difficult to work the comm.erciaI into the column. Some years .

ago, for example, I did a piece about Alexander the Great,
and, believe you me. it took a. heap of stretching; to drop in
a plug for Marlboro. The way I finally ma.na.ged it was to have
Alexzmder go to the O1'acle at Delphi and say, “Oracle, I have
conquered the world and tasted all its pleasures, but somehow
I am not content. I know that somewhere there must be a.
joy I have not yet experienced." To which the Oracle replied,

   

.0

“Yes, Alexander, there is such a joy, but, alas, the time is not
yet. I refer to Marlboro Cigarettes which will not be invented
for another 2500 years.” Whereupon Alexander fell into a sulk
from which he never recovered . . . Well sir, there is no question
I sold a lot of cigarettes with this ingenious commercial, but
the gang down at the American Academy of Arts and Letters
gave me a mighty good razzing, you may be sure.

But I digress. Back to biology, and the most advanced
hylum of a1l—the chordata, or vertebrates. There are two
inds of vertebrates-—those whose backbones run horizontally

and those whose backbones run vertically. Generally, there is
no great difﬁculty in distinguishing the two varieties. A ﬁsh
for instance, has a. horizontal backbone, and a man has a vertical‘
backbone. Occasionally, however, you run into a problem——liko
a ﬁsh who swims upright and a man who spends most of his
time in the sack. How, in such a case, do you tell one from
another? Science struggled with this sticky question for cen-
turies, but ﬁnally Sigafoos of M.I.T. came up with abrilliantl
simple answer. Oiler the creature a Marlboro. If it is a ﬁsh, it wi
refuse. If it is. Homo sapiens, it will accept. In fact, the more

sapient, the quicker the acceptance. 0 1,6, M, ,,,,,,.,,,,_

up . 1: at

The makers of Marlboro, upright vertebrates all, remind
you that their line cigarettes are available in pack or box
wherever, cigarettes are sold in any of the 50 states. A

Student Opportunity

Three philosophically—oriented‘ student groups have re-
ceived official recognition from the Student Affairs Com-
mittee recently. Two of the organizations, Americans for
Democratic Action and the Society for Conservative Studies,

issues with others of like mind; the third, Pitt Political
Forurn,’hop'es to provide a platform for discussion with
others of dissimilar views. ‘

. A/The intent behind formation of the ADA, the Society
for Conservative Studies and similar ‘study groups’ is ad—.
'mirable: to supplement the academic program with organ-
ized“‘bull sessions” dealing with political topics and to en-
-able members and non-members ’to hear, prominent speak-
ers from the philosophical environments which thelgroups
represent. A ~ g ,

, By narrowing the latitude of discussion in a time when
political issues are becoming ever more \complex and di-
verse, a relatively homogeneous group can still hope to find
sharply‘ controversial topics. Also, a student with a vague
interest tending toward a particular political pole can obtain
information which will either buttress or discourage his
tendency. ’

But the.Pitt Political Forum offers even greater pos- '

. sibilities: it promises to continue the process of extra-cur-
ricular education beyond where the others stop. So that
‘the individual study groups do not become a plethora of in-
group nuclei—each limiting itself only to the confines of its
own philosophical background———the forum can, by the coer-
cion of prestige, force members of the individual groups to
defend theirown views and challenge others’. _

__ In addition to providing opportunity for intra—Univer—
sity debate, the forum can collect funds from all the study
groups and procure more eminent personalities than any

0 of the member groups could hope to obtain

It is to provide these functions that the Student Affairs ’

Committee envisions a federation of campus study groups.
Each would remain an individual, autonomous entity free

_, to enjoy the open debate and collectivized funds which the

federation would manage. .
The merit of Pitt Political Forum over the Student Af-
fairs Committee’s federation is that with forethought and

careful -planning, students themselves may tailor their own

organization. Here is an opportunity for STUDENTS in
the student affairs area.

Al Fable‘  bu-r 7Sp"ace, Time  .

  Ce|,eis’ria| Epicure.

At least once upon a time there was this rather
magniﬁcentldragon at large in the universe. He
had been born in the eddies of a vast and turbulent
cloud of interstellar dust, in a time when almost
every frontier was new.‘ So the
incandescent young dragon set
out to make his fortune in the
wide open spaces.

‘Being light’ in years, he just
ambled along down the Milky
Way, gobbling innocent little
planets and menacing the con-
stellations.

“Out of my way, ugly!” he
snapped one day at Taurus, ﬂick-
ing his’ tail impudently.

‘ “You lizard,” snorted the
bilious immobile. bull, blinking his famous eye.
“You think you’re pretty hot stuff now, sizzler,
but time will cool your off.” i ,

‘‘You’re nothing but an overgrown glowworm,”
said the Crab. “You eat stars but you are mortal.”

C “You lack equilibrium,” said the we1l-bal-
anced Libra. « .

“Oooh! Stop that!” said Virgo, the professional
virgin.

But the arrogant dragon paid no attention to
the carping of the constellations. After ages of
lazying around in the cool darkness of space, roll-
ing over only to pluck a succulent star from its
orbit, or to snatch a clawful of the meaty little
meteors which swarmed past occasionally, _he
grew fat and fussy and began to pamper his
stomach.’

Aged Properly '

After a while,: the only things he could enjoy
were the little red stars, which, properly aged,
were incomparably tasty. A

In his rash youth, he had —once swallowed a

planet covered with green stuff, and he was sure
it had“ given him his ulcer. Big white stars gave

him heartburn (too much hydrogen) and little’

black ones were so difficult to digest.

One epoch, after lunch, the aging gourmet was
drifting along, not far as the dragon flies from
the cloud of his birth. r

"The universe is what it always was and will
be,” he sighed,‘ gazing gloomily at his .fulgent
paunch. “But times have changed.” A fat little
star was warm in his belly and the light from
good old Mom brushecz over him, but he felt tired.
He stretched a bit, belched delicately, and yawned a
dragonly Vyawn, carefully avoiding one (if those
nasty green planets.

Alas, he did -not see the tiny speck which shot
out «into space and his lazily gaping jaws. The
dragon gulped, coughed, and ‘thought he had
swallowed a live comet. The speck, itturned out,
was an adventurous young man just up from the
country.

Quolh. Quail: ,

“Dies Irae!” quoth he, straightening the tie on
his space suit. “My mother never told me about
this.” A

There was a slow ‘explosion as the dragon
quietly dissolved into a fringe ofismog and myth
and -the dust from whence he had come. Some-
thing there was in the dragon’s blood that could
assimilate stars but not ii men. A

The woi;ld’s” first gastronaut, who had slept
through most of his journey in the belly of the
dragon, also returned, to Mother Earth,-— and has-
tened to tellall his friends about the big celestial
city. “You should have seen the pretty lights!” And

' Only One Outlook

Hollywood is spiritually incapable "of making "a
serious movie. A simple statement, one that has in
one way or another been made more times than

it is desirable to contemplate. Often enough, at
least, to make it as blandly
meaningless as “Only You Can
Prevent Forest Fires” and a host
of other generally agreed upon
homilies that yearly go blissfully
ignored in this country of ours.

The Sad Thing about this '
statement is that like “Only 
You” and so on, it is true. Even
wood movies each Saturday
know why, but something is
wrong, something smacks of the badly» unreal»
something tends to send them into slumber or that
Vile Practice most people go to Saturday m0Vi<"-‘S '50
ritualistically perform.

There are also articulate critics. They know.
And because they know, we do too. » Their multi-
tudinous groans extend from the peevish letters of
F, Scott Fitzgerald to the pages «of Esquire
magazine. .

What I ask now is a simple question, one typi-
cal of myiextremely liberal (and loathsomely lazy)
nature: since we all somehow or another know.
why not let it go at that? Why not shrug our col-
lective shoulders and forget those otherwise har-
rowing experiences of seeing Troy Donahue dance
his way through a musical version of “Moby Dick”
or Tuesday Weld taking the Oscar for her perform-
ance in the title role of “Anna Karenina?”

The simplest attitude I’ve found for approaching
our barbaric ﬁlm capital’s approach topart is to re-
solve not to even blink when the news arrives that
the Sacco-Vanzetti case is being made into a Disney
family comedy. At this stage, of my own private
aesthetic atrophy, I don’t think I’d register sur-
prise if the report reached me that the entire col-
ony, in punishment for its many sins, was sliding
Paciﬁc’ Ocean-ward at the rate of twenty miles
an hour. ‘

In short, I genuinely feel that anything short of
indifference to our nation’s moviedom will result
in a hair-tearing session no man should experience.

If Suchpan attitude cultivates the D‘ an zation (com

 

By Bill Bennett -—-A-—

bined with Blessed Relief, as the—.boys in Radioland
are wont to say) that‘ Hollywood movies are harm-
less to the man with any brain whatever, and
provide a safe dark sanctorum for the Saturday
Nighters.

But before retiring again to my accustomed

slothex-y,iI wish to make one qualification to my
remarks. There are times——and 10, in these dark
and troubled times they grow even more numerous

—— when I am roused from slumber and wax nearly 7;?

wroth enough to toss my specs into the fireplace.
These times, _Gentle Reader, are those when my
wandering eye catches one of those newspaper ads
that proclaim that the California Happyland is go-
ing to release a serious film. That is’ to say, a
noxious botch job of some famous story is, going

to get the Beast and Boombang treatment. “Guns. -

of Navarrone,” si, “Tender is the Night,” no.
There is an obvious reason why my protests

shake the very vaulted beams of my living room. ,

Hollywood’s forgeries of the classics are seldom less
than libelous. Some of the finest lines produced by
our‘ civilization are pared down to fit the vapid
faces and scarecrow gestures of Jill ‘St. John and
countless other typecasted, box—office oriented
aesthetic ciphers. -

Death ‘lo MGM

But I have another reason forimy despair, a

reason that Hollywood’s cinematic monarchs might

well heed. It is simply that Hollywood’s brand of
seriousness is doomed to failure: it is a mere muta-
tion {vithout a pretense to stand on. They please
no one. ' A ’

The simpkin who goes to themovie house to

‘count the knifings and exploding battleships will

be bored by what to him are the dry plots present-
ed by a Melville or Tolstoy. The intelligent man
will know in advance what sort of treatment to
expect from a film version of “Ulysses” and avoid
the movie house like a ‘veritable Den of Pestilence.

So nobody wins. The serious film is shownside
by side with Japanese westerns in the backwaters
less than two months after its fu1l-page-in-the-
New-York-Times release. The crowned heads of
Hollywood get together and decide in their mag-
animous manner that the country’s taste is domin-

ated by feebs and begin anew to glut this taste. . \

Long Time

Geraldine iVlcCord

Began as Secretary
By SUSANNE ECKMAN

Geraldine McCord, manager of
Administrative Services at the
University Book Center, was hon-
ored last Thursday at a testimon-
ial dinner commemorating her 35
years of service.

The surprise luncheon included
twenty—seven guests,’ from the
Chancelor to faculty members to
secretaries from several depart-
ments. Typical of the sentiments
expressed is an inscription by one
of the guests: “If you werea book
you would be on the “Most Popu-
lar" list, and reviews would read,
“Vibrantl, Heartwarmingl,” “In
Tune with our Times,” and “Most
in Demand.’

‘Mrs. McCord was hired Febru-
ary 1, 1927, as secretary to Harvey
Meese who was then manager.
She remembers the “small frame
building where Engineering Hall
now stands,’ which was then the
site of the Center, as “much smal-
ler of course, than our present
site.”

Became Co-Manager

She became co-manager of the
store in 1936, and full store man-
ager during World War II. The
busiest time in her career was
shortly after 1945 when 20,000
students, many aided by the new
G.I. Bill flooded into a bookstore
of less than 10,000 square feet. The
store was then on the ground floor
of the Cathedral.

During her years of service
Mrs. McCord has “seen the ar-
rivals and departures of three
generations of students,” and has
“served under Chancellors Bow-
man, Fitzgerald, and Litchfield."

She is still small, slender, and
energetic, however, and according
to Paul Boltacz, general manager
of the Center. “At no time has it
been any other way‘ to her than
that the most important people to
come into the Book Center are
those who attend the University.
This has been a constant in spite
of the many large changes in the
Center.” M _

Mrs. McC0rd lives in Wilkins-
burg and has one daughter, an
alumna of the University. None of
the other employees of the Center
exceed ‘her years of srvice, but she
and th two other oldest employees
make up a total of almost~100
years. 0 W

The dinner only commemorated
her service and does not imply her
retirement.

Artist to Talk
At Book Center
About Africa

Dr. Frederick S. Franck, Nev
York artist, dental surgeon and
author will discuss his own works
in the Fine Books Room of the
Book Center on Wednesday at
4:15 p.m. _

Franck has prepared both the
text and the drawings for his
African Sketchbook, the‘ theme of-
which “reveals the Continent’s
rebirth as it bows down to a new
god, Progress.”

After establishing a dental
clinic in Lambarene, Franck be-
gan collecting” material for his
book entitled Days with Albert
.S‘chwe2't2er: A Lumbarene Land-
scope.

In addition /to the above books,
the author will also discuss My
Friend in Africa, a children’s
book, and the volume which he
is now preparing, Drawisng and
the Joy of Life.

Dr. Franck’s recent paintings
will be on display in the Henry

The Theatre department held
its annual awards banquet last
Saturday. '

The Pitt Player award, for past
performance and future possibili-
ties, was given to George Mazzei;
the Senior Achievement award to
Gil Lazier; the Junior Achieve-
ment award to Bill Kingsley; and
the Honors Awards, for excellence
in all capacities in the theatre, to
Bill Kingsley.

Alpha Psi Omega awards were

Pat Burgh Wins
Scholarship Award
Patricia K. Burgh, a student in

the School of Pharmacy at the
University, has won the four-

'teenth Borden Scholarship Award.

Miss Burgh is the top scholar in
her class with a straight “A” av-
erage for the ﬁrst three years.

The award of $300 is presented
to the senior pharmacy student
who has the highest grade average
for the ﬁrst three years at the
college. Dr. Joseph A. Bianculli,
dean of the College of Pharmacy,
presented the award at an all-
school assembly

 

for overseas projects.

across the nation to establish spe-
cial Corps program of classes and
seminars‘ which will instruct. the
volunteers in the culture and lan-
guage of the area‘ to which they
will be sent.

“This coming year will be a cru-
cial one for the Peace Corps,” Dr.
Zasloff stated. “From its infancy,
it has grown into a program which
can make a useful contribution to
the emerging nations of Latin
America, Africa, and Asia, and
can be of significant benefit to
American foreign policy.”

Actively involved in the de-
velopment of the Corps, Dr. Zas-
loff is at present a part-time

' consultant to the year old gov-
ernmental agency. He worked
last summer and worked out a

Corps which is now being used
at the Puerto Rican training
headquarters. _

“There, Corps volunteers headed
for Latin American countries spent
a month living in tents on a Puer-
to Rican mountainside,” Zasloff
explained. “Their training in-
cludes physical conditioning, com-

tive villages, and discussions of
the problems they’ve encountered.

“This practical experience — a
temporary retreat from the con-
veniences of civilazition as we
Americans know it furnishes a
Peace Corps member, with insight
into the problems of an underde-
veloped emrging nation.”

“Every country in which the
Corps now operates is clamor-
ing for more volunteers, more
projects,” Zasloff commented.
“From thirty to forty additional
underdeveloped countries are
asking for new programs to be
set up.”

“Requests far exceed the num-
ber of Corps members avaailable.
Right now we have from 700 to
800 volunteers in the field, but
we’ll have 2500 at work by the end
of the summer.”

“The Peace Corps has a warm
and realistic approach to the prob-
lems of underdeveloped countries,
which matches with actions and
convictions of the United States;
(but) all too often Corps volun-
teers must tackle . . . suspicions
and misconceptions in the coun-
tries to which they’ve been as-

signed.” Zasloff concluded.

"It Goes On

 

A POSSUM IN WAITING

Frank Carver, the gregarious athletic director of Pitt, is
the epitome of a graduate of Dale Carnegie’s course in “How
To Win and Influence Friends.” He succeeded a giant in the
business of running a house of sport.

His predecessor, Admiral Tom Hamilton, a retired Naval officer,
was as righteous and dynamic as Teddy Roosevelt, only he adhered
to the famous West African proverb, with. an innovation of his own,
i.e. “Speak harshly and carry a big stick.”

I His duty, Roosevelt once said, was to “stand with every one while
he was right, and to stand against him when he went wrong.” And
Tom Hamilton decided who was good and who was bad. During his
reign of terror, two football coaches, “Red” Dawson and Len Casanova,
walked the «plank, falling into the sea of disfavor.

Ousted Non-Comformers ‘ ,

Indirectly, he bluntly encouraged “Red” Carlson to retire to the
tran uil world of stethescopes and cardiographs where patrons came
  " V ' » ~ » of their own doing. It stemmed
from Car1son’s refusal to con-
form to modern recruiting tactics.

Carl. Olsen, the tart-tongued
track coach, was retired in much
the ‘same’ fashion as the venerable
Casey Stengel. Olsen's stigma
was disrespect. And a mischiev-
ous golf coach, Bud Gaskill, had
Hamilton seeing red on the play-
ground green.

“Captain Tom” was Zeus

reincarnated. He was the Lord

Frank carver of the Sky, the Rain-God, and
the Cloud-gatherer. who wielded the awful thunderbolt. A seismo—
Eraph could record a quake when a coach was called before Ham-
ilton’s desk. I

With Chancellor Litchfield, a dynamic in his own right, and the
foreboding trimester plan, snorting down his collar, Hamilton bailed

 

A out. Out like a lion, and in came a lamb. Frank Carver is not hard-

hearted, and the loudest rap against him is that he will never fire
a coach. He has been at the helm for two years with a clean slate.

Carver admits his shortcomings. “Hamilton was dynamic.” he
said. “I’ll never be dynamic. I am a non-athlete in an athletic job.
I could never go around and pose as an authority."

AS 3 Youth Carver dabbled in the track sport. a bit, but he was
never in the running with running, and his athletic duties at Pitt
were confined to a long tenure of pounding a typewriter as the publi-
city man for twenty-two years.

“I quit going to practice years ago,” Carver admitted. “I felt that
it wasn’t my job to scrutinize the coaches that closely. I’ve never
played, never coached and I never think thatl am in a position to
criticize. I can’t draw a single play on a blackboard, or demonstrate
a single wrestling hold.”

Goes By Intangibles

What then does Carver use as a yardstick‘? “I can only evaluate
a coach by the attitude of the players. The way they take a win or
a loss. I go by intangibles, and maybe my criticism is unjustified.”

Carver emphasized the contrast with the Herculean Hamilton.
“Tom was a positive character," Carver exclaimed. “If I were a coach
I’d be a helluva lot more conscious of the athletic director if he
were_Tom Hamilton than if he were Frank Carver. Hamilton never
accepted defeat as evitable. He just never accepted defeat.

“There is still no substitute for victory,” Carver admonished,
"but you have to learn to live with the losses, too.” By learning to
live with losses, Carver has drawn disapproval from die-hard fans
for his failure to wield an iron gavel. Even Chancellor Litchfield
recently cried for an upsurge in “inspirational coaching" among the
Pitt ranks.

“Anybody would have trouble in dismissing a coach," Carver
claims. “The coach wouldn’t share the same opinion. It would prob-
ably be the hardest job to tell somebody he isn’t competent. I’m not
in any more of a hot seat than any of the individual coaches. Ifany
of them took anything personal about Chancellor Litchi’ie]d’s mes-
sage, he did so because the shoe fit.”

And Frank Carver lies in waiting, not as a Lion, rather as a
possum.

There’s A “Miniature Mike Ditlca”

By JIM 0’BRlEN

Whether it’s the sloughy gridiron or asthmati.c legs hasn’t
been determined by analysis, but, according to backfield
coach, Carl DePasqua, the Panther b-allcarriers have been a
little “heavy-legged” in recent skirmishes.

“They’re starting to loosen up,” DePasqua remarked,

“but these intermittent rains keep us practicing one day and

not the next. They can never
really keep the tone high.”

The situation at left halfback
appears healthy at the moment
with three veterans “all pushing
for the front-line berth,” but
there is only one vet at the other

wing right now. He is junior John,

Ozimek, and, according to De-
Pasqua, ‘fright now we really miss
Paul Martha.” .

It is no military secret that the
Panthers plan to utilize the break-
away speed of Martha at the
flanker position. “His presence
makes Rick Leeson all the more
effective at fullback,” says Jim
Traﬁcant, “and I— think Leeson
is one of the greatest runners in

, the country withou‘ him.”

As it stands in spring drills,

The track team has come un-

The Redskins have beaten the
Cats before, however, and th ey

ranks, leads the way. He is be-

plains, "the biggest lack is in run-P
ning skills. We'll miss Bob ,Clem-
ens and Fred Cox who had those
skills. Cox always came up with
the clutch play, even though his
running was sluggish.”

When cold statistics were cited
about the running effectiveness of
the departing pair last season, De-
Pasqua admitted, “We were very
disappointed with the perform-
ance‘ of our backs last year. It
was one of the big letdowns on
our club, and it wasn’t from lack
of skills. We were, however, very
pleased with how Ed Clark, and
some others ﬁlled in.” g

The question about where Fred
1\/lazurek will play is still up in
the air. “Wherever hc’ll do the
most damage to the other teams,”
DePasqua smirked.

“Still the brunt of our attack
will lie on the shoulders of our

fullback corps, and they’re quite ~

impressive.”
