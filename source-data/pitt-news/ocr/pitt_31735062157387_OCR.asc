sDean of the new Graduate

School of Industrial Health, Dr.

Thomas..Parran, former surgeon-general of the U. S. Public Health
Service, is preparing a program and a faculty which will “develop
into the leading center of industrial health and its branches.”

At a -press conference in the ofﬁce of Chancellor Rufus Fitz-
gerald, Dr. Parran told reporters that the school will serve the.
Pittsburgh district as well as mankind in general.

—_Dr. Parran said, ‘‘It is hoped’.
that our s_ervices and skills will.

be made available to industries in
the area.”

He expects to initiate a small

class next fall and will recruit

the ﬁnestpossible faculty.

Cooperation was asked from
other activities of the University,
accordingto Dr. Parran, as even
a staff and a building do not in-
sure success. “One should voice a
word of conservatism,” he said,
“The staff cannot spring into full
bloom overnight.”

He’ has collected names in “a
little black book’? for prospective
faculty members and will visit
other medical centers to enlist in-
structors. The functions of the

school were outlined by Dr. Par—'

ran as being teaching, research,
and community service.
Success will not be measured in

‘terms of numbers of graduates, he

said. He implied that the service
in conquering disease and com-
munity service_would be stressed.

Dr. Parran mentioned a debt of
gratitude to Paul Mellon and the
Mellon fund for the interest in
public health and thanked Dr.
Fitzgerald forthe opportunity to
head the school.

“I am looking forward to this
task ~with greater enthusiam
more, perhaps, -than I have had
for -any other tas ,” he said. Dr.
Parran recently completed an as-’

Alumni Openi
Homecomng
Program Today

Pitt’s alumni began invading
Oakland today prepared to cele-
brate the annual homecoming fes-
tivities. _

The program will get underway
this evening at the Hotel Schenley
ballroom where the Letterman’s
Club will. hold their annual fall
di£ine1*.

Next on the schedule will be
a mammoth ‘.‘Kill the Irish” pep

[rally at the Bigelow Blvd. en-

trance to the Cathedral.

_, Mayor‘ David L.‘ Lawrence‘,
Notre Dame Coach -Frank Leahy
and Glenn_ -“Pop” - ,Wa;rner will
head the lineup’ of speakers at the
Alumni Smoker which starts to-
night at 8 p. m. in the .Schenley
ballroom. _

_ Many Pitt football greats, in-
cluding Marshall Goldberg, Tony
Matisi, Bill Daddio and Dick Cas-
siano, will be on hand tomorrow
at half time to pay tribute to their

Stadium gates open at 11:30
tomorrow morning.‘ Stampede
of the afternoon is expected in
the student section where 12,-
000 persons tussle for 10,00?)
seats. '

Athletic Director Frank Car-
ver observed at the SMU game
Saturday that 8,000 students
overﬂowed the 10,000 seat ca-
pacity in the studentsection.

According to the acting di-
rector, there should have been
2,000 empty seats in the stu-
dent section Saturday. There

_were people standing in the
_area. ” '

Carver reasons that students
did not make economical use of
space.’ As a‘ result‘ much jam-
ming occured. Theoretically,
the situation tomorrow will be
tragic if people in the student
section don’t occupy one instead
of two seats. -

Kick-off time is 2 o’clock, but
students who expect to be seat-
ed at that time should arrive at
the gate by 1:30. Otherwise,
they will face the problem of
viewing the game from the out-

old coach, D_r. John B. .“Jock”

Sutherland.

Several "shifts have been made
in the backﬁeld. Pete Fuderich
has earned the starting nod at
quarterback, and _Bob Becker at
fullback, supplanting Walt Cum-
mins and Bill Abraham.

The choices at halfback prob-

ably won’t be made until kickoff
time. Bobby Lee and Bimbo Cec-
coni at left half, and Bill Bruno
and Jimmy Joe Robinson at right
half are the alternatives.
' Notre Dame employs two units
for offensive and defensive play.
In order to bolster their compar-
atively weak tackle positions, end
Leon Hart and guard Bill Fischer
play tackle, defensively. I

As‘ a result, "Hart and,Fischer,
as well as end Jim Martin and
guard Marty_ Wendell were re-
quired to play nearly 60 minutes
in the Irish 28-27 squeak over
Purdue. The visitors will drill at
the stadium at 3 o’clock this after-
noon.

Nineteen ‘games have passed
since the South Benders last tast-
‘ed defeat; Weeping Frank Leahy
has so few injuries to deﬂate opin-
ions of his squad’s prowess that
he “has started building up the

A pep rally, one of the high-
lights of the weekend homecom-
ing celebration, will take place
tonight on the Bigelow_Boulevard
side of the Cathedral grounds at
7 o’clock.

The rally, first of its kind to be
held this season, will feature ap-
pearances by Coach Mike Milli-
gan and team captain Bill Mc-
Peak. The Pitt band and the
cheerleaders will assist at the pre-
Notre Damee game warmup for
alums and students.

Woody _Wolfe, KDKA sports-_
caster, will act as master of ‘cere-
monies and will introduce the
speakers. Sponsors of .the rally
said they are expecting a large
turnout in view of the high in-
terest in the big game and equally.
high hopes of an upset victory for
the Blue and Gold.

Early plans for a parade through
the Oakland district had to be
cancelled abruptly. City officials
said the appearance of vice-presi-
dential candidate, Senator Alben

offer a traffic problemi and per-
mission for the procession was
withheld.

The Pitt band will march to the

stadium on its way to the smoker
in the hotel to play several Pitt
songs and help in the cheering.

No CLIPPINC PLEASE

With the city ’s barbers raising the price of haircuts to $1.25,
the surest way to avoid the inﬂationary prices is topattend the
.Pitft-\Totre Dame game tomorrow afternoon.

According to performances at games with the Irish in the
past,, the number of ticket scalpers, hucksters, and souvenir
salesmen should reach mob proportions, All of them will be
eager to trim their customers. Allwill be eager to make a deal
“a little on the side.” ' .

Last year, the kindly eﬁorts of Inspector John Flavin kept
the tribe at a distance from the stadium and the results were
a much happier holiday for all fans concerned. Due to a
recent turnover in personnel at the N0. 4 precincit station, In-
spector Frank Ferris isnow the man in charge.

It is now up to Inspector Ferris. V'\7ill the paying public‘

suffer continual tugging at the lapels or will they enjoy an an-
noyance free day at a football game? Lend a hand, Inspector.
Scalp the=scalpers and keep the public from getting clipped.

E CHEER Eon YOUR
OWN. TEAM

Notre Dame is ‘here ‘tomorrow and,-as usual, draws some
30,000 Pittsburghprs some of ywhom are, most of whom wish

they were alumni of the South Bend school. This throng of

. “subway alumni” as in many places in the country, is the

‘most vocal and ardent following of any football team in the

nation.

For sure, the city’s “Irish” will rock the Stadium with

their oral enthusiasm, while Pitt in their own stamping

grounds will be given a comparatively-weak “rah—rah” from the A

student section and other spectators, outnumbered by the vis-

itor’s supporters,

This piece could evolve into an essay on school spirit. Let ’s
limit it to this. It seems that every year a goodly proportion
of the_ Pitt student“ body, is openly pro-Notre Dame. That they’re
going to Pitt doesn’tpse’em to make any diﬁerence. '

Why have the Panthers ’playing.a football game onitheir
own ‘gridiron with a crowd strongly behind their opposition?
After all, 'the..pro-ND Pittites are actually turning against
their own school-mates, even though they may never see a
member of the squad among the 23,000 inhabitants of the
University. ’

Besides, we’d‘hate to have these particular people feel
strangely while taking’ the opportunity of joining the most
monstrous of all victory celebrations beginning late tomorrow
afternoon and running well into next week.

Once upon a time there were
three bares who worked for a
little burlesque theater on Dia-
mond Street. The hours were good
and the work was of an artistic
nature. Many the happy lads it
.was who passed up Econ. 3, or
English 21 to .watch the matinee
from a secluded fourth-row—cen-“
ter seat. Moral: you don’t learn
everything in college.

Once upon a time there was"
a rabbit who challenged a tur-

So the turtle agreed to race the
rabbit fairand square. The day
of the big race arrived and
there " was much cheering and
much shouting. but oh; boy, the
rabbit won hands and feet down.

and through the poor turtle and
handed him a, crushing defeat.
Moral: pay the football‘ play-

Once upon a time there was a
little girl called Goldie-locks’ and
she went for a walk through
Schenley Park. ‘A wolf drove up
in his shiny, black, convertible

the University of Pittsburgh”; So
he took a second look and dated
her grandmother." Moral: If all

like it he'd clap his hands and
“zowie,” he’d have his pipe and
bowl and ﬁddlers three. Just a
knock of the knuckles and the
guy had a smoke, asnort, and

Then there was this chick called

lost in the registration shuffle.
The head of the Tuck Shop found

them on to the ulcerated stomachs
of the student body at a couple of

Director

Explains Price Hike
o Student Congress

“Why coifee at eight cents a cup,’

’ has been the im-

‘portant question since the three-cent rise went into effect
- Miss Ruth L. Cramblett, director of the University food

A «-seryice provided the answer last week in answer to a Student

_. Congress committee investigating not only coifee, butthe rise
If on many Tuck shop food items. ‘
First she explained, “None of the State'app1‘op1‘iatio‘n of

' ffunds to the University may bee
‘vutsed to balance any food service

fdeﬁcit,‘ so this leaves us a self
Supporting organization.”

 A breakdovsén on the eight-cent

.;cost revealed that one cent goes

7,-jfor coffee, three cents for pure
' .cream, and four cents is spent on

;labor and sugar.

 Miss Crambletr added that
f_many‘ restaurants dilute the cream
'{used‘ for coffee, but that the food
_$e'rvice prescribes to state purity

‘iii-.»__,1‘<j.‘gula’£i0ns, and uses 18% butter

item sold in the Tuck Shops is

gain enough’ from other items to

the food service’s
costswent for food in the past,
27% was spent on labor at pre-
-inﬂation wage rates, and 11% on
maintenance. Maintenance at

‘I present" includes repairing seats,

plus replacement of disappearing

3 utensils.

“Another food item that re-

A . _quires more labor are salads.”
_ _"‘They took a rise, but still remain

Full Calendar Faces
Athletic Committee

Meeting

New applications, still arriving from all parts of the United
States, will be added to the list of applicants for the vacant athletic
directorship when the Athletic Committee convenes at the call of

next week.

A busy agenda faces the group. The recent injunction granted
against expanded use of the Ellswort Center ﬁeld created a crisis
insofar as the intramural athletic program is concerned.

The 1948 football
which includes at least. three new
opponents,- may be completed in
time for the committee’s approval.

A sub-committee within the
Faculty-Alumni-Student unit has
sifted over 40 applications and a
number of non-applicants. A com-
mittee spokesman pointed out,
however, that present jobs virtu-
ally preclude an appointment be-

coaches of some teams, such as

scheduling. The universal popu-
larity of basketball mentor‘ Dr.
H. C. Carlson makes him a good
bet to retain his scheduling rights,
however. _

The current rumor that a com-
bination director-football coach is
being sought was discounted be-
cause of the animosity it might
create among coaches ‘in other
sports.

Some observers also point out
that the combination of the two
jobs uiakesit difﬁcult to give ade-
quate attention to either.

PIA’: seek

New Members

The Pitt Independent Associa-
tion has announced that its mem-
bership drive is now in full swing.
Membership this year is expected
to top. that of last year’s with an
expected 700 members.

‘Members and prospective mem-,
bers will not want to miss any of
the social events on the PIA’s
calendar, many of which are
planned for the near future. ‘In
addition to the regular weekly
‘dances on the twelfth floor which
will’ soon be resumed and the
monthly showing of movies, there
will be a pep rally and a hay ride
Friday, Oct. 15, and a masquerade
Saturday, Oct. 30, at the YMHA.
On Dec. 21 the PIA will hold their
ﬁrst semi-formal at the Schenley
Hotel and on Jan. 12 there will be
a street car party.

Further announcements con-
cerning social events will be made
in the NEWS. Membership cards

VA Urges Vets
To Memorize

‘C’ Numbers

Veterans expecting prompt re-
plies and service from the Vet-

-‘erans’ Administration are urged

by the V.A. Office in Philadelphia
to memorize their “C” (claim)
numbers.

The importance of these claim

numbers cannot be too strongly‘
stressed especially for those vet-
erans with
‘Smith, Brown, or Adams.

common names as
In the
ﬁles at Philadelphia are approxi-
mately 24,000,000 veterans’ names
of which there are 217,000 Smiths,
12,500 of them named John. Also
on ﬁle are 38,500 Adams, 960 of
whom are named John Quincy;

'7,000 John Browns; 9,0-00 William

Browns; 12,000 Bradleys, and 102
Eisenhowers.

Every veteran who has applied
for any type of compensation or

schooling under the G.I. bill of

rights has been assigned a claim
number. As far as the V.A. is
concerned, this claim number is
more important to the veteran
then his name. No number is the
same, but there are thousands of
duplications in names.

Any veteran who writes to the
V.A. office for information» con-
cerning his insurance, schooling,-
pension, etc., and doesn’t include
his claim number may be forced
to wait much longer for a reply.

Special Band Formatons
For Permsyivania Week

Along with Homecoming Day ceremonies honoring the late Dr.
Jock Sutherland at the‘Notre Dame—Pitt fray tomorrow, the 120-
piece Pitt band will also present formations and a musical tribute

to Pennsylvania week.

Special pre—game formations
will include the word “lrish," in
honor of the visiting rivals, and

a goal post with the letter “P”
above the cross bar.
Dedications to the common-

wealth will be staged during the
half—time intermission. '

Following the introduction of
the “All American” group in the
homecoming day exercises, the
“University of Pittsburgh Chant”
will be played by the band and
sung by students and alumni.

In the state celebration at half-
time, the band will form a key-
stone in the center of the ﬁeld,
facing east. The official “Penn-
sylvania State Song” by Gertrude
Martin Rohrer will accompany
the pattern.

A _
The outline will then change to
the state of Pennsylvania. During

this formation a brief description
of historical, industrial and re-
creational features of Pennsyl-
vania will be announced over the
public address system. _

At this point Robert Andrews,
the drum major, will indicate the
points of interest within the out-
line of the state.

Historical signiﬁcance will be
emphasized by the music, “Yan—
kee Doodle Boy.”
the Fringe On Top” will depict
agricultural development. The im-
portance of the northeastern an-
thracite district will be portrayed
with the melody “Hi, Ho, Off To
Work We Go.”

We Happy Few

By DON GIFFIN
Sports Editor _

Pitt emerged from the SMU game Saturday afternoon on
the short end of the score, but not short. on promise of im-
proving in coming clashes. ‘ “ . '

Apparently too much caution rather tl1an_ a pronounced
lack of abil_ity produced the 19-point gap in the ﬁnal count.
VVhen the Panthers abandoned their conservative and impo-
tent ground thrusts in the ﬁnal quarter and brought an aerial
attack into play, they began to connect and advance with sur-
prising regularity. .

Still, if they throw off the caution, a trait that seems -a
holdover from last fall, Pitt has an‘ excellent "opportunity of
doing what Purdue made such a game attempt of doing last
Saft.urday—-upsetting mighty Notre"Dan1e. -

Look at it from this angle. Although the high—powered
Mustangs chalked up ﬁve ﬁrst ‘downs and advanced 186 yards
on the‘ ground here Saturday, signiﬁcantly they had to rely
2:; on their passing and Mr. Doak Walker’s punt
return to reach tally alley. This indicates that
once again the Blue and Gold land defense is
‘tight when it has to be.

Now look in at Notre Dame Stadium Sat-
urday. The Irish scored 28 points and, strange-
ly enough, not a one through the air. Frank
Tripucka hit with 10 of 16 aerials, but he
doesn’t appear to be another Johnny Lujack,
who heaved one or two touchdown forwards a

   
   

I .' Trzpooka

A game last year, even though Frank Leahy described Tripucka’s
_ performance against Purdue as “superb.”

 

I Throwin with this the scouting report of Bob Timmons,
a member of one of the world’s more cautious professions,
coaching. The Pitt end mentor gives the impression that Notre

- Dame is "good but not the national ‘champions of 1947. You can

see where the Panthers lie.

Dawgone if we haven’t convinced ourselves that the ’-{L8
Pitts are going to be famous in years to come as the amazing
eleven. that upset the Notre Dame apple-cart after 19 straight
games without a defeat.

Sharp in Debut

Delta Tau Delta showed Friday
that they were a force to be reck-
oned with in the scramble for this
year’s IF championship. Scoring
early and often, the Delts wal-
lpped the Alpha Phi Alpha’s, 38-0.

On the ﬁrst scrimmage play,
Kent Thorpe intercepted a pass
and went twenty yards for a score.
From then on, the victors. un-
leashed a brilliant aerial attack

Bill Hawkins, who did most of
the throwing, connected for four
touchdowns, two to Bill Brehm’
and two to Bill Webber. The sixth
TD came on a ‘pass from Brehm
to Thorpe. , '

The losers threatened only once,

when they moved to the ﬁve on a
40-yard run by Clarence Crawford
followed by ai30-yard pass from
Crawford to Bob Hawkins. An

Study of New Irish Formations

use. A _

Next week Pitt meets West Vir-

Dud De Groot has dreamed up
any new formations the Pitt grid-
ders are bound to be more than
just a little confused when game-
time rolls around. __

Getting back to the Notre Dame
affair, however, it will be a rad-
ically diﬁerent Pitt teamithat will
take the ﬁeld against the Irish this
week. No less than ﬁve new faces
are. in the starting lineup.

Fuderich at Quarter

Spunky Pete Fuderich, a 175
pounder, has replaced big Walt
Cummins ‘at quarterback while
Bob Becker moves into Bill Ab-
-raham’s fullback spot.

A new set of guards will prob-
ably replace Mike Boldin and vet-
eran Bernie Barkouskie.
likely choices for the posts are a
couple of Charley’s, Yost and
Thomas.

Barkouskie,' troubled by a
sprained ankle, has had difficulty
in cutting. '

At center Don Fisher, _l90 pound
husky, has turned out Len Rad-
nor. Fisher, a fourth stringer in
pre-season drills, performed un-
expectedly well against Southern
Methodist.

Other than the switch to “T”
formation study and the lineup
changes, the only new develop-
mentsin the Pitt camp were the
resignations of "guard Fred Cimino
and tackle George Gallino.

Both sophomores, Cimino hailed
from Weirton, while Gallino was a‘

Rough Warfare Saturday  

By MYRON KOPISJLMAN
Pitt’s football players may not as yet be experts in execut-

ing the single wing, but they have mastered fairly well the art of .

attaching an elbow or a set of knuckles to an enemy player’s nozzle.
In the-SMU-game, it was obvious to observers stationed on the
playing ﬁeld that the Panthers need no ﬁnishing school‘educations.
They knowvery. well how to finish off someone.
Doak Walker, pride and joy of Southern" Methodist, declared

after the game that “those Pitt¢

guys were concentrating on being
rough instead of playing football.

“We don't go for that stuff down
in Texas,” declared the halfback-'
ing hombre from down Dallas
way. _

‘It cannot be denied‘ that Pitt
Coach Mike Milligan had forgot-

ten to teach his lads to say “May.

I?” when rustling the pigskin
from an -SIMU ball carrier. But the
Texans had a book of tricks, too.
