Petrilla. Captures 118-Pound
Boxing And Wrestling
Championships

Three Kayoed In Show

By Edwin H. Beachler

lrlriday nights athletic sh0w——
according to Jack Schrieker, pro-
1note.r—was the first hon.est-to-
goodness bloom of an Intramural
prograni of boxing and wrestling’
at the University of Pittsburgh.
From now on, ﬂowers do mix with
mit and mat, -

In the 165-pound ﬁstie championship,
stocky Harold Neibel belted Bailey \Vi1-
liams, scappy colored ﬁghter, in the
third and ﬁnal round to gain the deci-
sion in the fa.stest action match of
the evening. Close to 100 wildly yell-
ing fans were on their feet for the
better part of the three-round scrap.

M-anfredo in the 145-pound wrestling
ﬁnal caught Geyer off guard in the
first 25 seconds. lifted him in the air
with a body hold and pinned his
shoulders to the mat with a chancery.
This was the shortest bout of the eve-
ning.

Another interesting mat ﬁnal, the
J55-pound, saw Referee Oster, varsity
wrestling coach, halt the match so
that Summer, on the bottom, could ad-
just his sweat pants. ‘With keen en-
joyment, the spectators shifted their
attention from the boxing match in
progress inside the ring to the mat.
as Simencff soon threw the “pantsless
grappler” with a. head chancery
(headlock) after six minutes and 40
seconds.

Swazuk and Kalik in the 128-pound
boxing ﬁnal stood toe—to-toe in the
ﬁnal round of their bout, spasmodic-
ally missing and connecting with long.
hard blows to bring the fans to their
feet. Witli but 1:05 minutes gone in
the third canto, Swazuk landed two
driving rights to the head, causing
Referee‘ Smith to stop the ﬁght.

Petrilla was the only double winner
of the evening, whipping Underwood
in the three-round featherweight mitt
ﬁnal and piling up a two-minute time
advantage over Reddo to win in the
115-pound wrestling division.

Russ Bedillion, varsity wrestler, was
given the nod in the 138-pound boxing
clash over Appel by virtue of a steady
left jab. McAdams won the 148-box-
ing title from Stronko on a decision.
‘William Schwimmer, in the 155-pound
ﬁstic division, was forced to default to
Jack Denny, due to an injury that was
aggravated in a semi-ﬁnal bout.

Anthony Matisi won a three-round

The University yesterday officially

next i'a11‘s freshman medical class
will be $500.

Dr. Raleigh R. Huggins, dean of the
School of Medicine, explained the
cliange from $400 to $500‘ was caused
by the decrease in enrollment re-
quired by law,

Only 50 freshmen will be admitted
next fall. Previously the number
was 65.

Following are the tuition fees of

Taylor Questions
Grading System

lV£a-t.hem.atics Colloquium To Hear
Explanation Of Charts

   

The question of whether the pres-
ent system of grading college stu-
dents according to a distribution
curve is a. sound method will be dis-
cussed by Professor J. S. Taylor, act-
ing head of the inatlieniatics depart-
ment, at a ineeting of the ‘.*\-lathematics
colloquium. \Ved11c.sd,a._v in Room 102,
Alumni hall, during the seventh hour.

According to Dr. Taylor, this motl-
od of grading is open to serious ob-
jection. The use of this curve for
purposes of grade distribution, he
says has introduced serious evils. The
matlieinatics professor takes strong
issue with many educators on this
question, but is in agreement with
most of the members of the Uni.ver-
sity School of Education on the point.

P1'of-1-ssor Taylor's discussion will
not be limited to g1‘:-‘ldlll}._’,‘, but will in-
clude an explanation of charts show-
ing distribution of a variety of statis-
tical phenomena, ranging from the
heights of men and hair breadths of
students, to the number of petals of
Ranurculus Bulbosus to the degrees
of cloudiness at Breslau.

Students interested are invited to

‘Bill’ Relates Experiences
As Penitentiary Oﬁicial

 

By William Stark

If you want a job, why not be a prison warden?

No less an authority than William (Bill to his friends) Daufenbach, who
was a deputy warden at the Vvestern Penitentiary of Pennsylvania between
1903 and 1911, at Bellefonte Penitentiary from 1911 to 1917, and at West
Penn from 1917 to 1923,‘advises' ambitious‘ psychology "majors to become

wardens.

“Although it’s a tough game,” Bill says, “there is a. need for college

graduates in this line of ‘business.’
growing tendency on the part of
prison authorities is to choose college
men who know how to treat prisoners
in a scientiﬁc. way. _

“But you deal with the scum of the
earth, and as for myself, 1 am sorry
I gave up 20 of the best years of my
life to it. One is actually a prisoner
of these prisoners, subject to immedi-
ate call at any hour of the day or
night. I remember numerous occa-
sions when I was attending a theater
or visiting friends and was summoned
back for duty.”

It was Bil1’s duty to handle all death
warrants at Bellefonte.

Bill took part in the first 17 electro-
cutions in the State. It was in con-
nection with this that Bill was trans-
ferred back to West Penn. He re-
fused to “throw the switch” on a con-
victed murderer. He was willing to
bring the prisoners to Bellefonte and
sign their death warrants, but he re-
fused to be executioner.

“I found,” Bill said, “that the cause
for most of the trouble in prisons re-
sults from the fact that we could not
give the men the kind of work they
desired. Some wanted to cook, others
to bake and still others wanted to

A6

work on the looms. There simply were
not enough of the right kind of jobs
to go ‘around. °

“Vile started all the men in the quar-
ry and as they merited advancement,
they were advanced to road work, jobs
as foremen and ﬁnally trusties. \Ve
kept accurate records of all the men
and were able to select the choice of
the lot for the t.rustworthy positions.”

It a. man was serving a 10 to 20-year
sentence and applied for a pardon at
the end of his minimum time, the au-
thorities first went to Bill. If a man
could get along with Bill, he could
get..along.in the world. Bill carried
as much power in this matter as the
judges.

“Despite the shortcomings,” Bill add-
ed, “I always found one consolation.
If a prisoner found out that you were
trying to be honest with him, he would
work his ﬁngers off for you. On the
other hand, there were some men with
whom it was absolutely necessary to
be more stringent.

“I ‘believe there are more men in
prisons who shouldn’t be there than
there are out of prisons, who should
be in. Some should not be in prison
at all, but in hospitals.”

Seible To Speak
At Inquiry Forum

Literary Critic .To Survey Youth
Adjustments Wednesday

George Seible, literary and dra-
matic critic of, the Pittsburgh Sun-
Telegraph, will speak before Inquiry
forum Wednesday on “A young man
surveys the world.”

Mr. Seible said he intended to dis-
cuss the world as it appears to youth
today with its problems involving ad-
justment to a changing civilization.

The columnist is well known
throughout the district for his criti-
cisms and semi»-weekly informal ra-
dio talks on books and plays over
Vi-“GAE. He is also president of the
National Turnerbund, or American
gymnastic union, the oldest German-
American organization in the coun-
try.

This will be the last Inquiry forum
of the year, Katherine Monori, chair-
man, announced.

Seven Fraternity

Positions Filled

]%‘r-ank Frederick, C36, will be chair-
man of next year's lni.ert'ra.ternity
Ball; Ralph. Appel, BA36, will head
the Interfraternity Conference events
in l\.*ovember. Rueben Slesinger, C36,
will edit the fraternity handbook.

A. W’. Schenck, DA37, has been des-
ignated chairman of the first I-F in-
formal dance; Joseph L. Rodgers,
BA36, will be rushing delegate at
large; VVillian1 Housel, C37, and Harry
Zinsser, C37, will supervise all I-F
athletics.

Appointments were made by the ex-
ecutive beard of Interfraternity Coun-
cil.

 

The regiilar \veck-end he:-n'ings
of the State l.nvesti_s:'a’t.ing com-
mittee were enlivened Satin-day
when .l}.lug_ri1 \Vi11g, :instr1"u-tor in.
English since 1926, charged sup-
pressuni of his classroom teach-

ment to avoid “propaganda subjects"
\Ving was told that continuance of
such teachings “would probably end
your usefulness as a teacher.”

Dr. Mont R. Gabbert, head of the
philosophy department, blamed unde-
sirable University conditions upon in-
adeqiiate and insecure income, tenure
policies which are not altogether clear,
unfavorable publicity during the past
few years and the large number of dis-
missals which have tended to accent.-
uate fear among the faculty.

Herbert B. Cohen, York Democrat
who is chairman of the House Appro-
priations coinmittee, sat with the ﬁve-
man investigating body headed by Eu-
gene A. Caputo. '

Other witnesses were scheduled to
be called Saturday afternoon Unless
time is taken for rebuttal testimony.
the latest meetings were likely the
last.

Defend Administration

Dr. T_\‘la1i.1i<.-l C. Elmer, head of the
s<:-ciology (lepartineiit, said, “The feel-
ing of uuce1‘taint_v is based on the lack
of fB.('i'.ll.':ll_ linowledg ..” He added, “It
is a rather unique experience being 011
an indefinite contract at Pitt after a.
nlontli.-to-niontli contract at the Univer-
sity of Kansas.”

“Faculty representation on the
Board of Trustees would not do any
harm.” maintained J. Steel Gow, exec-
utive director of the Falk Foundation,
and present. trustee. He declared t.ha:'.
the election of alumni to the Board
would be “a very wholesome thing.”

Mr. Gow blamed‘ “publicity” for
present attention of. the educational
world to the University, saying,..“The
situation has been magniﬁed very
greatly. It has not one tenth the
scope, the depth that the publicity
seems to give it.”

Professors supporting the adminis-
tration’s policies included Montfor_t
Jones, economics, Dr. Evan T. Sage,
classics, Dr. VV. H. Shelton,’ modern
languages, H. E. Dyche, mechanical
engineering, Percival Hunt, English.

Tyson, Wilner Tangle

1-‘:-iday's day and eveningsessions
were featured by a heated controversy
between Dr. F1'aneis ,D.- Tyson, profes-
sor of economics, and J. Alfred VVi1ner,
counsel for the plaintiff “liberals.”

Denied permission by the committee
to introduce a letter which Dr. Tyson
had written. three months ago to D3‘.
Colston E. ‘\-Varne. Wilner proceeded
by indirection to attack the professors
statement that “Conditions at Pitt are
no worse than at any other university
which is growing rapidly.”

“This man isnot telling the truth,”
be declared. Then, when committee

members asked liimv to retract, Wilner
repeated, “I have the evidence in my
hand." The inference was that re-
marks made by Dr. Tyson in the hear-
ing and in the letter were mutually
contradictory.

The economics professor denied
having said, "Dr. Bowman is a prima
donna and is moving to the Fascist
right.”

Hovde’ Cites “Fear”

Associate professor of history, B. J..
Hovde asserted, “Tenure at Pitt is-
not in conformity with good university
practice.”

Asked by Chairman Caputo if pol-
itics would not result from public rep-
resentation on the Board of Trustees,
Dr. Hovde replied:

“There are politics there now.”

The question of salaries drew from
the witness the statement “The. differ-
ence between administrative and pro-
tessorial salaries is too great,” and
“The work of the professor is much

Dr. C. F. Cheelzzli Denies Some
Call Him. Chulloughlclszilczsise

 

By James Donoghue

Dr. C. F. Checlzzli, speaker at last week’s Inquiry forum, today had
cleared up matters as to who he really is——that is, to himself.

The Department of Justice may call him Vvizzward Solomon Jeremiah
Challoughlchzilczise or Vlfyxzewixard, but it is wrong—Dr. Cheelzzli himself
reaffirmed Friday that he is an Abyssinian patrieian and former ecclesiastical
envoy of His majesty Res El Memhlik II of Abyssinia.

He denied he “illegally entered” the United States, that he was a “faker,"

that police were after him.

He also iterated and reiterated that
he is a graduate of both Oxford and
"Caa1nbridge"’ universities, but he did
not seem willing to go into any great
detail.

The doctor was in a very demo-
cratic mood Friday, notwithstanding
his ancestry. In his small first floor

front he received the Pitt News re-
porter with great cordiality.

and apologized for smoking.

Very early in the conversation Dr.
Checlzzli stated he “liked” students.
They were one of the select group of
philosophers, writers, artists, etc.,
who alone he allowed to enter.

ruption.”

Dr. Cliec-lzzli proved himself an en-
tertaining conversationalist. He dis-
cussed everything from elephants to
Oriental philosophy without the least
sign of strain, although once or twice
he got bogged in zoology and had to
wif-’:f<le to extricate himself.

Best of all Dr. Checlzzli liked to talk
about his work. His work, he claim-
ed, is to awaken the racesuand speci-
ﬁcally the .-\meric-an Negro to the
ﬁnal redemption of Africa. The Ne-
groes are to educate themselves and
prepare for “the day"’——possibly about
1940, he believes-—when they shall
move to the land that God intended

Vi-'omen, he said, were forbidden by ! them to have, viz., Africa.

As Catholic Chaplain Here

Clmplain to Roman Catholic stu-
dents in the University will be the
Reverend E. !Lawrence O’-Connell, of
St. Paul's catliedral, University oili-
cials announce today.

rector of guidance and research of the
Pittsburgh diocese of the church. He
will. upon assuming his new post,

Festival Dance Proﬁts

 

Financially, the Spring l-‘esiivtil
(lance on May 4, the day after annual
activities tap day, was the most suc-
cessful of any such affair this year,

A preliminary, rough, incomplete re-
port submitted by Chairman Ellis H.
Tump-son, BA36, and Paul Baker.
BA35. business nianager, shows 
probable proﬁt aggro;/atiiig $253.86.
Most other all-University dances this
year either broke even, netted small
proﬁts or lost heavily.

About 350 couples attended.

And these aspects reveal the com-

written objcc’

plete individual, not only in his dreams .

and ideals but also in his lowest phy-
sical desires. Moreover, Dos Passos'
characters struggle, stagger, and slide
through life as you and I do. There
are no carefully constructed climaxes,
no trick plots. The most significant
event in the life 01' one of tl1<-;-m may
transpire near the beginning of the
-.1uthor’s account. Usually he ends
their story at a somewhat important.
phase, but the reader is lett with the
understanding that tlicir joys and sor-
rows, unless death has snipped their
thread, will go on.

Since Dos Passos makes no com-
ment. on his c-1'eat11res, l liave general-
ized his attitude negatively Irom tlre
way his characters act. He 13 not 1:

Puritan because the ‘moral is never.

pressed explicitly or implicitly that
sin pays wages. \-Vhen Joe \‘.’i1liams
bats around, he occasioxially has to
spend his payroll at :1 doct.or’s to get
cleaned up. Dauglitcr loves Dick not
wisely but too well, and with his child
in her body she commits suicide. On
the other hand, John Andrews feels
no moral qualms about deserting even
when he is arrested, and the preach-
er’s wife goes back to her husband
l1ea.lt.hier and happier afte-.1‘ a. liaison
with an adolescent.

,Dos Passos is not a. mystic because
his clmracters, while they are some-
times puzzled at the mystery of life
never go into tranccs over ultimate
realistics, and the author is sensible
and sane in describing their bewilder-
ment.

‘He is not an idealist because his
characters fall in aml out of love.
make friends and lose them; because
his three soldiers discover they were
inalcing the world safe for the interna-
tional b_anl;crs.,not for democracy;
because the utopias of his radicals are
iemperecl by the imperfections of their
own natures.

And he is not a complete cynic be-
cause his cllarac-tors all have their
moments of kindness, affection, and
sorrow for the t.rage(ly of their fellow
men.

More Than “Pink Tea.”

Positively, his attitude is one of in-
tense. interest——a compound, if I 111:-xy
venture the opinion. of deep sympathy,
hatred of man's inhumanity to man
and the injustices of the capitalist
system, a natural curiosity towards
people's thoughts and actions, and
overs11a.dowing everytliing else, his
own wonder atthe great -Why of ex-
istence.

Dos Passos’ general lteclluique is, as

have mentioned, objective. The au-
thor does not tell the reader about his
crea.tu1-cs. He does not comment,
analyze, or;des(-.ribe as uutllor. They
live, move, and have their being, see
their world through their own eyes~-
and that is the story.

This technique has one notable su-
pc-riority over the literary types. If
it, is well employed, as I believe it is
by Dos Passos, the reader presses
close to reality. He lives with, almost
becomes, the central figure in the
story, who is the axis about whom his
cnvironrucut revolves. Dos Passos
wants the reader to comprehend a
period and 8. place from more than one
point of view. ho\vever_ Consequently,
his novels have several heroes and
heroines, as it were, instead of only
(:l'l(“.

Writings Gives His Novels Dynamic Appeal

OHN DOS PASSOS is a }'O1ll1_£l‘ Amcric-an writer who has written four novels of realism. lie  not

a Puritan, not a mystic, not an idealist. not a. complete cynic.
;.ic-al political leanings. I do not think that the prime purpose of his books is to propa,9;andize any phil-
éosophy. His great interest. is in ordinary people and their environment.

Although he shows marked rad-

At ﬁrst ,uflauce there may appear to be no coimcctirm binding those abstractions. But I believe
there is. Dos Passos, as nearly as it IS possible for any intelligent. human being‘ with inescapable pre-

tangled. And in the course of trac-l

ing the threads. Dos Passos covers a;

good deal of the United States and‘
France from pent houses to slums.

Thus, the whole sweep of his novels

tends to present a panorama of mod-
ern life.

Dos Passos has accomplished pretty,
well, I think, what he has set out to!
(lo. His clia1'aci;ers are terribly real
to me. Somehow he has made them
human beings. I do not find myself
saying, as I lmve in reading Dickens,
for example, “What 2*. neat little per-1
sonality he carved out in so-and-so.”
I feel 111016 tli-at he is a line literary
biographer; and yet I know that the
wide ran§.,“e of types that live in his.
p-.i_9,'es cannot be ﬁt-sh and blood people
whose careers he has merely report-
cd.

1 ‘.‘1(llllll‘é.‘, too, the fact that Dos
Passos is more than a “pink tea." real-
ist‘. He lms not been afraid, for one
reason or another, to strip off the
sug:u'-coating of contemporary Amer-
ican civilization. If something is a
5-.pa(le, he has not licsitated to call 
a spade.

On the other hand, I should consider
him a §.,,-‘reat e;cnius, had he struck :1
lsct*.er balance among his creatures.
Tlmt is. I liave his conviction, without
undue optimisi'n over it, that there are
-.1 number of fairly c.ont.ented people in
this world of hates, inhibitions, and
clccaying inst.itutions. I feel, therefore,
rluxt -.1 l'L“lilllSllC- novelist who attenipts
to k:1loidos(:(>pe tlic life of :1. nation
should include 21 happy soul or two in
Iris picture.

This Dos fl-‘assos has not quite done.
Unless I misl.11terpr<-:-.ted them, his peo-
ple are, to a man, indivii‘-.u,als who have
not captainetl their souls, or if they
have captaiized them, have made 3
pretty bad job of commzindeering. Per-
haps, when the novelist grows older
and inellower, when the passions of
his youth have subdued, he will create
:1 world that is tijagi-coinedy, as I in
my immaturity believe it actually to
be, rather than comedy or tragedy.

Dos Passos has been branded as at
rmlical p1'opaganrjlist. This criticism is
unfair llecause it is incomplete. All
truly great writcrs,.witl1out a single
I-xc-e1)l.ion that 1 can think of, have
been p1'op-agaii-(lists. They have
prcacllccl morals, attacked social con-
vcniiions, or advanced theories of liv-
imr. And why not? Etliics, religion,-
politics are fiimlainental parts of al-
most every man’s complete being.
Realistic, and well romantic literature
to a lesser degree, tries to represent
life. Ideas about human problems,
hence, must, or at least should, enter
into their works.

Propaganda.

The whole. question of the value of
propaganda in literature. is a matter
of literature. If tile writer is an artist,
if he has cre°.1ted real cliaracters in a
real environment, he has produced
the stuff of literature. If he has ad-
vocated through the voice of his char-
acters or with his own comments at
new social, political, or economic phil-
osopl1y—~—so much the better. ,_j'l‘li:~.>
use of propag-and,a in creaﬁve writing
can only be justifiably objected to
when it lowers the literary worth of
the author’s composition; when, in
other words, it makes the cliaracters
or environment unreal or otherwise
spoils the artistry.

To accept this explanation of the
place of propaganda in literature, and
I thinlr. it is accepta.l)le, is to recog-
nize Dos Passos as a novelist who has

propagandized lcgitim_at.ely in his
books. As 1 have already submitted.

his great interest is in representing
ordinary people in their environmen‘;.
The highest nianifestation of his gen-
ius, to me. is his ability to make his
cllgu-21cte1's and their su1'1'ounding':3
real. But it is to his credit also that
he has attacked (-stal)lisl1e(l institu-
tions of the modern order and advo
cated radical rci'orms as a literary
artist, not as politician or an agitator,
in his account of individuals whose sit-

Featu re Clinic

Aside from the meat and potatoes
served at the luncho;-on in \VebsteI'
hall, the clinic followers were served
-.1 straight football diet at the Univer-
;:-'ity’s fourth annual football clinic.
Even at the luncheon, football was
,«_~erve,d between courses and after the
meal. Some of the coaches, and play-
ears as well, replayed some of the
best football games in history 1'it-liht
2l('I'OSS the tables.

Before the entire audience gathered
in the stadium for the earl)’ DI‘08’I‘-9-111,

Defensive tackle play took up the
greater part of the time, liecaiisc of
the interest the co2..ches had for this
ntti-ticiiiar department of play, For an
hour and a half the centers were kept
busy going through all the rudiments
or i".l1.'1T position. Backs were used to
show how the ball carrier and line-
nieii can cooperate to gain more de-
ception as well as speed on offensive
plziy,

For the next hour and a lialf the
:.:uards took turnra at pulling out of
the line to lead inte-i'fei-eiice. The
boys did it. enough times to convince
(in) \’lSll,Ol‘b' that f,’.'l.li.t'l'.iS when they
are running before a. ball carrier can
get out there fast enough to cut down
LL lot of tacklers. The ends worked
for a good part of the time demon-
siratiiig the comparative V-a1i.ies of
both types of end play, tloutiiig and
-niasliing. COllSlfleI‘ablP attention was
given to deception in line play‘.

The Georgian room at \\.'ebstci' hall
was ﬁlled with tackles. ends, guards
and backs soon after the dinner bell
called a halt t.o the morning prograin.

——A Galaxy

Of Pittsburgh Tennis Stars

 

Joe And Bob Represent The

Family On Panther Varsity;

But Little “Tuz” Promises To Be Best Of All

'l‘liere"s soniething about a. brother act that catches the fancy.

The Pirates have the \V'aiicrs, the
the St. Louis (.‘-ardinalsliave those

Boston Redsox have the Ferrells,
intrepid Deans, and according to

our Pottsville cori'espon-defiit, the Pottsi-’il.le Maroons have their

Becks.

The object of all this is that at Pitt. we have the Maddens. They
are: J oscpli _Madden and Robert. Madden, respectively. Brother Joe

is captain and No. 2 man on the var—¢
-sity tennis team and Brother Bob is!

‘O put °n7just plain No. 1 iii-an, no mean feat‘

for a sophomore athlete.

VVlien thinking of the brothers Mad-
den it’s not hard to picture the brothers
Dean. The Deans’ stock in trade runs
to strikeouts, won ball gaines and a
heck of a lot of conﬁdence. The .\Iad-
dens’ stock runs to aces, love sets
and they fairly well match the Deans
on point three.

But just as in the case of the ball-
playiug brot.liers, Joe and Bob have
plenty on the i'e.cord books to back
up any COIlﬁ-:lell(:e- they could ever
hope to build up. Bob holds more
titles than an English Duke and his
big brother clouts them over the net
with the best of the racquetnien.

The younger of the Pitt Maddens has
sulfered but one defeat in intercolle-
giate conipetition this season, having
won six victories in a row. One of
these was scored over Navy’s ace,
Midsliipinaii Jack Mann, over whom
very few victories are being stored
this year or any other year. lgast year,
as top-notcli man on the fresbi.i:iii out-
ﬁt, Bob went tlirougli the eixtire sea-
soii’s S('hE‘dlll-3 without being once on
the short end of the score.

The ciirly-liaii'ed sophomore raiiks
as No. 1 in the Middle Atlantic States
junior ranking and is listed as No. 9
in the national junior ratings. In the
district l'a1.l1l{iI1gS, Bob is Listed as No.
1 in the junior division and No. 5 in
the senior section. W'lien in Schenley
high, Bob won the Harvard cup, a
brief way of saying that he was the
top-ﬂight player in high school cir-
cles of the district.

Joe is Good, Too

Brother Joe is the boy who would
now be playing at the N0. 1 position
for the Panthers if it wasn’t for Bob.
All of which means that Joe knows
his way around the baseline. He
turned in a. record of 13 victories in
14 attempts last season as a soph-
omore and has dropped a sum total
of two matches this year.

Last sumnier Joe teamed up with
Frank Broizla, present captain of the
Harvard university team and No. 1
ranking singles player in this district,
to win the Du Bois doubles champion-

ship. Joe is also a product of Schen-
le_v high.
While Bob conﬁnes his campus

activity to tennis endeavors, Joe lias
also donecreditable work with Pitt
Players, the Men’s Glee club and just
ﬁnished playing the part of Governor
Schnialz in the Cap and Gown show.

But the Pitt brother act is by no
means the end of the Madden tennis
dynasty. There is Mary Madden, C34,
and now a student at the University
law school, who very ralely serves
doubles when she gets out there on
the tennis court- And Elizabeth, a
senior at Sclienley high, is learning to
master her chops and slices with the
same success that she. has in picking
up algebra and the rest of the high
school book work.

Finally there is little Mardaugh Mad-
den, aged 11' years, who promises to
be the ace of them all. Big Brother
Joe, is forcedito admit that “Tuz" can
just about take him over right now.
“Tuz,” it is understood, is another
name for hiardaugh and was coined
by little. Elizabeth years ago when
she found the longer given name a
little too tough.

The boys give credit to their father,
.T. Vvarren Madden, professor at the
Pitt law school, for starting them out
on the clay courts. “Among the ﬁrst
opponents I reineinber having was
3ill Daiifeiibach,” said Joe. Daufenbach
WES, undis, now, assistant to the dean
of men.

Asked in what year he first began
to Swim: a racquet, Joe thinks it was
1928. “The depression and I started
getting good at about the same time,

Jack Leonard, a light-heavyweight
boxer, suifered a severe injury to his

After two minutes had elapsed with
neither registering a time advantage,
they started the ﬁrst of four two-inin-

position. At ﬁve minutes and 10 sec-
onds, Richards slammed his opponent
with _a reverse head and crotch hold.

There was no competition in the

remaining wrestling titles were won
by Stoker, who threw Cartwright in
the 125-pound title-match, with a half-

In Go Fighters,
Out Go Cagers;
Nobody Worries

The Panther basketball players have 

no home.

But it’s really nothing to get
alarmed about. Its just that the lii-
traniural boxers and wrestlers moved
into the stadium pavilion to do their
slugging and groaning, thereby forc-
ing the cagers outside.’ The cagers
are now engaged in spring practice.

Nothing dauuted, Coach Dr, H. C.
Carlson sent the boys up to the
stadiuin‘. and set them to tossing bas-
ketballs around up there. Fifteen of
next season's probable squad were in
on the workout before the empty
seats of the huge bowl.

Pete Noon, Ted Roderick, Bob Jones,
Ollie Lengyl, Myles Zeleziiik, Ken
Kuno, Toni Leech, Eddie Spotovicli,
Joe Garcia. Jini Taylor, Lem Rowe,
Bill Jesko, Bob Ellll‘l:':k, Bill David-
son and Bob Johnson were involved in
the open-air workout.

‘ If the good weatlier continues, C'ai‘l-
son may elect to send his charges
througli tlieir spring paces out-of—dooi's
for some time to come. And if the
stadium workouts will aid in ﬁnding
replaceinents for Skippy Hughes and
Claire Cribbs. G-roundkeeper Frank
Mecca. isn’t likely to object to the
activity on his mammoth green.

Group To Offer Catltedral
Song At Wednesday
Night Musicale

“No, there is no bearing with these
spiteful neighbors.”

That isn’t a complaint to Mr. Fixit;
it’s only the title of’ a. song concerning
the sad plight of a young man in love
whom the neighbors will not let alone.
And the song, Which is by Brahms,
will be sung by the VVomen’s Choral
at their annual home concert at Car-
negie ‘Music hall this \Vednesday.

Tickets for the concert are avail-
able today at the Choral exchange
stand on the first fioor of Alumni hall
and may be obtained tomorrow and
Vvednesday at the candy stand oper-
ated by the Choral in State hall.

The Choral, apparently, is going in
for Bralnus in a big way thzs year.
Besides the songs on the peskiness of
neighbors, the group will sing three
other Brahms’ love songs and the
soloists of the evening, Robert C.
Topping and Marion. VVerner, C37, will
also do a Brahms’ song apiece

Other numbers on the program will
range from a group of old Swedish,
French and English folk songs to Mr.
’I"oppin§:’s neiideringz; of the quite mod-
ern “Song of the Open,” by lr‘ra.nk La
Forge.

Mr. Toppin,-2‘, guest soloist, is reg-
ularly the leading tenor for the West-
minster Presbyterian church of Steu-
benville. Ohio, and was formerly with
the Miami Symphony orcliestm. Last.
winter he sang with the Bach choir
here.

Marion ll-"erner, C37, will be the
only featured student soloist. Miss
‘Werner is :1 transfer student from
Xlvestminster, who is majoring in
music, taking most of her work at
the Pittsburgh Musical institute under
Charles Frenii,

Another spotlight will be taken by
Lucille Hamilton, who besides acting
as accompanist and being in charge
of the as yet secret decoration scheme
of the evening, has made a special
arrangement of lVIoussorgsky’s "Tre-
pak” for choral purposes. Miss Ham-
ilton and Ruth VVeldon will furnish
a. four-piano acconipanimeut for the
Brahms group of songs.

The program will also include a
quintet version of 3. French seven-
teenth century folk song, “The Timid
Sl1eplxerd.” Members of the quintet
are: Ell.Z8.l|€ll1 Creese, soprano, Anna-
belle Knupp, soprano, Louise Lough-
ner, second soprano, Grace Seifert,
alto, and Carolyn Hall, alto.

Mrs. Robeit C. Topping will play
the accompaniinents for Mr. Topping
and Miss Werner.

‘Dorothy Zimmerntan, C36, and Elise
I-lamilton will sing the solo hits in
two of the numbers to be given by
the entire Choral

And besides all of that, th.er'Z.~ will
be the Chorals Cathedral song. to be
sung Vvednesday for the first time
and to be used by the Choral as their
signature number for every concert
hereafter.

The Choral, whose season ends W'ed-
nesday, has given 15 concerts this
year including programs at churches,
the College club and the Polish Coun-
cil meeting.

Following the concert Wednesday.
the Men's Glee club will entertain
members of the Choral at a dance, the
place to be decided later.

Stands Today

Weighing in ----

Two Pounds

Two pounds.

It" means that you caneat break-
fast every day next week, that you
can use cream in your coffee and
eat a second piece of chocolate fudge
cake.

It means that you won’t have to
slink past the dairy store, and you
can again arrange to meet your
friends by the candy stand. And
it means you can stop worrying
about those two or three formal
banquets next week.

What has this matter of two
pounds to do with this? Well, people
get weighed every day on the scales
In the Student Health office in
Alumni hall. If they “weigh in”
heavy, they do without lunch or a
milkshake. But it seems that the
scales were repaired several days
ago and it also seems that the
scales weighed two pounds heavy.

Our duty is done.

more important than that of the ad-
ministrator." _

Dr. Hovde summed up: “An atmos-
phere of fear surrounds the faculty.
This condition is rooted in the system
of tenure and in the suppression of
academic freedom.”

McKay Testiﬁes

Dr. Marion K. McKay, head of the
ccononiics department, when asked by
Wilner if “instructors still fear the
loss of their positions,” replied, “?H'on-
esty compels me to answer in the af-
ﬁrmative.”

He admitted that Dr. Bowman had
asked him to cancel a radio talk on
taxation because, “-Some members of
the Legislature‘ might get a false im-
pression, and thus the appropriation
would be endangered.”

Others on Stand

Adding their testimony to that of
Dr. Hovde and Dr. McKay were Dr.
Benjamin H. Williams, political sci-
ence, Dr. W. M. Parrish, public speak-
ing, Dr. George E. Jones, psychology,
Dr. 0. L. Reiser, philosophy, Dr. Put-
nam F'. Jones, Ralph H. Vvare, English,
