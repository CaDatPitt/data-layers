Strike looms over Port Authority negotiations

by Jessel August Costa III
Staﬁ’ W/riter

The wheels on Port Author-
ity buses might not be going
round and round for very much
longer, leaving many city and
county residents scrambling to’
find alternate. means of trans-
portation to work, school and
their various daily destinations.

The Port Authority of Al-
legheny County — the organi-

zation incharge of the county’s,

bus, trolley and incline services
as well as the T —— and the Amal-

gamated Transit Union’s Local
85, recently hit a pothole on the
road to a new labor agreement.

A ‘strike at any time ‘by Port
Authority employees could leave
countless riders around Allegh-
eny County stranded.

The contract for Port Au-

thority employees ended June
30, said the Port Authority’s
“Pittsburgh Transit Info” Web
site, which was established to
inform the public of labor
agreement developments.
Increasing gas prices are

making the Port Author-
ity squirm and consider cutting
back on funds allocated for em-
ployees, causing friction with
the Port Authority and the AT
Local 85. p 5,
The Port, Authority’s 200
budget undertakes “a minimum
of $10 million in cost reduc-
tions [that] will be achieved
through the collective bargain-
ing process with ATU Local 85”
according to a Port Authority

"press release.

Much of this reduction

would directly from
health care pensions and post-
retirement beneﬁts.

Patrick McMahon, president-
business agent for Local 85,
views the expectation for such
cuts as “absolutely not fair.”

“I’m going to tell you some-
thing right now, it’s not going to
happen,” he said.

McMahon said that it is not
reasonable to expect workers,
many of whom “take the job
for the benefits [pension and
post—retirement package]” to be

from the carousel’s principle

Schenley Plaza manager

“The carousel is greased week-
ly to maintain equipment. It also

passes daily inspections, as well as

those given. by the stateof Penn-
sylvania.

"It does cost a lot of money,
and it’s important for us to main-
tain it for a long life,” he said-.

Blair McCauley, one of the car-
ousel operators and a recent Pitt
graduate, said she noticed a strong
negative reaction to the discontin-
uation of the free rides from both
kids and parents. . ,

“Many parents were unaware
of the change to charging for rides
in the afternoon, and the regulars

Playtime's over for free carousel rides

are no longer able to take advan-
tage of unlimited rides,” she said.

“Kids demand to know why
they carmot ride or cannot ride
repeatedly.

, "There has been some crying
and a few tantrums, but most just
turn away disappointed.”

However, if the park is able to
accumulate more money for the
carousel, Griffin said that there
exists the possibility that free rides
could return in the future.

Although the operators them-

cut off after years of service.
“We’ve negotiated for these

T things for a long time,” he said.

“They [Port Authority] want to
take it all away, to gut everything,
we’re not ready to do that.”
The Port Authority cited in
the press release the rising cost
of health care — a 75 percent
increase from $38.8 million in

the 2002 ﬁscal year to $67.9

million in 2009 — as well as the
rocketing cost of diesel fuel ——

Dude, we're getting Dells: Pitt buys new computers

by Giles Howard
Contributing Editor

Computing Services and Sys-
tem Development recently pur-
chased 18O new computers to
be installed in three computing
labs on campus.

The computers are intended
for labs in Alumni and David
Lawrence halls and Hillman Li-
brary. Installation will begin in
July and be completed in Au-
gust before the start of the fall
semester.

“CSSD replaces approxi-
mately one—third of the comput-
ers each year in order to provide
students with up-to—date equip-
ment,” said Jinx Walton, direc-
tor of Computing Services and
System Development. _ ‘

University policy requires the
replacement of computers after

V three years.

>..The University accepted bids

for the 180 new computers from
IBM,’ Gateway and Dell-.

The computers purchased

‘were Dellsidlwith‘ 19-inch ﬂat
‘panel monitors. CSSD would

not release the price of the new

computers “for ‘competitive rea- '

However, “through econo-
mies of scale and the advantag-

dons

The Port Authority reported
that its budget for next year is
$350.3 million, an increase of
$14.3 million from the past ﬁs-
cal year, said the Port Author-
ity’s operating budget for 2008-
2009. g

“Every penny increase in the
cost of diesel fuel adds $80,000
in expense to Port Authority’s
budget,” a press release said.

Another increasing cost
to the Port "Authority "is L what

es provided by the UniVersity’s
size, we are able to purchase
new machines at signiﬁcant dis-
counts,” said Walton. _

Like all Windows-based
computers on campus, the new
Dells will run the Windows XP
operating system.

“CSSD does not plan to
upgrade the lab computers to
Windows Vista. at this time,”
said Walton.

The University will not switch
to Vista because of compatibil-
ity issues between Vista and the
130 software applications that
run on University computers.

Many of _the old computers
will either be used in the kiosks
or for other student-related
projects.

The remaining computers
will be transferred to the Sur-
plus Property Department for
s,aleVto the.public. _

According to the University
Surplus Property Departrnent’s

Web site, none of the old com—.

puters from the three labs in
question have yet gone on sale.
In addition, the comput-

ing labs at Alumni, Posvar and’
David Lawrence are also being’

painted and recarpeted for the
fall semester.

which is provided" to many re-
tired drivers.

This cost is in addition to a
pension of 2.5 percent times
the number of years served for
retired drivers, according to the
Pittsburgh Transit Info Web
site.

Port Authority board mem-

ber Joan Ellenbogen said that 1
the increasing costs arebecom-'

ing a burden.
“Taxpayers and transit riders
cannot be expected to continue

The 180 new Dell computers will be ready for the start of the

Rising gas prices have Port Authority fuming

to fund a health careand post-
retirement benefits package that
is far more generous than the
national average and is far more
than county employees and re-
gional taxpayers receive,” said
Ellenbogen in the press release.

With negotiations at a stand-
still, Port Authority and ATU

,Local 85 have been forced to"

adopt an independent fact-
finder, a ‘non-binding arbitrator,
whose job itiis to lay out a com-
promise between the two feud-
ing entities.”

For the compromise to take
effect, it must be agreed upon
by both sides with no changes.

The last instance of a fact-

finding expedition was in 2005,.

but nothin was acce ted.

it a-“waste of time.” “

Port Authority] can negotiate.”

McMahon pointed out the
catch-22 in the negotiating pro-
cess.

“What is a shame is the mon-
ey spent on the process,” said
McMahon. “We’re talking about
an agency that is concerned
about cutting expenses.”

The last Port Authority strike
was in 1992 and lasted 28 days
before a Pittsburgh, judge or-
dered for the strike to end.

Donors pay thousands to name the carousel creatures

Carousel, page 1 _

selves witnessed unhappy feedback from
riders, he received only one e-mail regard-
ing the issue.

“We had very generous donations from
several organizations and foundations, but
the amount was used up,” said Griffin.

‘We extended it as long as we could. It
was really popular for young families and
kids, but in order to maintain it and keep
providing it, we need the funding and the

revenue.”

Carousel courts C student riders

With its 16 'mirrors, rows of yellow
light bulbs, shiny golden posts and wooden
ﬂoor, the $300,000 PNC carousel, which
was made in Kansas City, resides next to the
Schenley Plaza Oval and attracts approxi-
mately 500 riders each day. I

In fact, Griffin said the June 27 WYEP
concert brought the daily total up to 2,000
riders.

-,Ir1.;,I-=addition.~toePNC, Grifﬁn also add-
ed othieripeople donated as much as
$10,000‘.-ins $20,000 for the naming rights
of a particular animal, and these names will
never change.

Riders can see the donors’ names, as well
as the names of the animals on a bronze
plaque on the floor of the carousel beside
each animal.

To ride the carousel, each person must
possess a golden token that can be pur-
chased two different ways.

Four or more tokens can be purchased
from a machine at the carousel’s entrance,

‘ which is credit card friendly, orriders can

obtain single tokens at the Asia Tea House
kiosk within the plaza. Each token costs
$1.25.

Tantrums aside, the carousel’s recent
tight funding did little to slow the demand
for rides from parents, children and stu-
dents. M

“Riders are typically kids, with or with-
out their parents,” said McCauley.

“A lot of families stop by after visiting
the Carnegie Museum or the library, and
some are just out for a day in the park, she
said.

"Occasionally, there are some student
riders — mostly students who vowed to
ride the carousel before leaving Pittsburgh,
or those who are just bored in Oakland.

‘'1 had a tour come through once, and
there havealso been several couples taking
engagement photos,” said McCauley.

' Since its conversion from a parking lot
to a plaza lawn in 2006, Pitt students have
come to see Schenley Plaza as an extension
of the campus, a sentiment Griffin encour-
ages. O

“We want to have a green space for Pitt
students since it’s such an urban campus,”
he said.

‘We try to keep it nice and safe, and
we welcome and encourage them to come
down.”

McCauley, a Pitt graduate, not only vis-
ited the carousel, she got a job there.

“It’s part-time, laid back, low pressure,
little responsibility and outside,” she said;

“That was exactly what I was looking for
in a summer job. I also had a friend who

 
   
   

and select   

worked there last year, so I knew what to
expect. I try to get some studying and read-
ing in when it’s slow.”

When she opens the carousel around 10
a.rn., some of McCauley’s responsibilities
include lifting and clipping up the tarp, un-
covering the animals and doing a test run.

Throughout the day, she collects tokens,
lifts children on and off animals and oper-
ates the carousel.

At 8 p.m. when she closes, she covers

the animals back up and clips the tarp.

Carousel operators also possess the
luxury of choosing their own music to play,
Griffin said.

On any given day, riders can experience
anything from marching band music and
smooth jazz to Norah Jones and the Red
Hot Chili Peppers.

“For the most part, it’s very fulfilling,”
she said.

“The kids are so happy and carefree.
Their biggest concern in the world is wheth-
er or not they get their animal of choice.”

ii Detroit-based casino executive Don
P Barden as the contractor for Pitts-

burgh’s Majestic Star Casino. But

L clearly, the luck has run out

Last week, Barden announced his

 plans to delay the construction of an
 outdoor amphitheater and other riv-
 erﬁront features at the North Shore

casino Barden had failed to acquire

3 the $10 million needed to continue
 the construction, despite his an-

nouncement of having secured a
$120 million investment from Wal-
ton Street Capital Fund 6, a private
investment ﬁrm, as reported by the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

But this news should not come
as a surprise Barden’s other projects
have not shown much success in the
past. According to the Post-Gazette,
Barden’s casinos in Indiana, Missis-
sippi and Colorado have suffered
great losses. Unfortunately, these
ﬁnancial woes seem to be 
their way to Pittsburgh.

It is difficult to understand why
the PGCB, along with Gov. Ed Ren-
dell and Mayor Luke Ravenstahl,
chose to award Barden with the ca-
sino license against other top com-
panies ir1 the first place Even still,
they are standing by their decision.

Rendell told the Post-Gazette,
“Give Don Barden some credit.
Notwithstanding a very terrible
credit market for  money,
he has kept construction  al-
most unbroken.” _

But the truth is that the city is
now dependent upon an unreliable
private contractor and is 
over backward to keephim. It is

likely that, somewhere down the‘

road, Barden’s plans will not pan out,
and Pittsburgh will lose all hope for
tnuch—needed tax revenue

The much bigger picture, how-
ever, is whether or not slot casinos
are an effective source of revenue
for the city of Pittsburgh Instead of
putting public trust into large slot ca-
sinos and undependable contractors,
the city should look more toward the
interests of local businesses.

Slot casinos are popular tourist‘

destinations that are usually all—in—
one resorts. For instance, according
to its Web site, Pittsburgh’s Majestic
Star Casino willinclude a steak house,
an Italian restaurant, a deli snack bar
and four casino bars and lounges.
This means that guests rarely have
to walk outside casino doors to stay
entertained, causing the surrounding
communities and businesses to suf-
fer ﬁnancially.

Bigger is not always better, and
Pittsburgh’s grand plan for a slot
casino did not have to be so grand
The city could have dispersed gam-
bling into smaller, local venues. This
way, Pittsburgh would depend upon
local businesses that would have a
real stake in the ﬁnancial success of
the city. .
Or perhaps Pittsburgh should
have chosen the more responsible
option and tried to find other, more
efficient sources of tax revenue.
City ofﬁcials would have done well
to look toward other cities, such as
Philadelphia, that have not had to
rely on slot casinos to fund their cit-
ies.

Unfortunately, Pittsburgh has
latched itself onto Barden and is un-
likely to see the end of casino prob-

lems any time soon.- *

Lettertothe-Editor

Something I’ve wanted to tell you guys for a while is how every-
thing and every opinion in the paper is completely liberal. That doesn’t
represent all Pitt students’ opinions. I happen to be extremely conser-
vative along with many of my friends here at Pitt, and it’s a rare day
that I can read something in your paper that I can even remotely agree
with. An educated person can display both sides of an issue. It is a
close—minded fool that can only see things one way and feels that they
need to tell people how to think instead of presenting the news on an
even keel. I would greatly appreciate the conservative side of things

better expressed in your paper.

High price positives at the pump

by Brandon Pfeffer

Colummltt

It seems like it was just yes—
terday that I was cruising down
Hersheypark Drive in the ﬁnest
12—miles—per-gallon utility van an
American car manufacturer has
ever produced: the Ford Mark
III conversion van. I’d swing by
the Shell station and ﬁll up both
tanks at $52.70 per gallon and then
exchange friendly but still very
masculine head nods with the guy
ﬁlling up his Escalade at the next
pump over.

These days, it’s impossible for
me to ﬁnish ﬁlling up my ﬁrst tank
before a brigade of Prius owners
swarm around me and start chant-
ing their mpg stats. Not that I can
afford to ﬁll my tank anyway.

But with rising gas prices and
the subsequent sacriﬁcing of our
Mark IIIs, comes a few underap—
preciated beneﬁts that we’re all

beginning to see:

Less Trafﬁc on-the roads

The Federal Highway Admin-
istration has reported a 2.1 per-
cent decline in overall road travel
since the beginning of 2008. That
means when the occasional drive
to the grocery store is needed, you
won’t be spending as much time
reading clever bumper stickers
while waiting for congestion to
ease.

And studies by the Congres-
sional Budget Ofﬁce have dem-
onstrated that people are cutting
their trips when prices raise — a
0.7 percent decline in freeway
trips for each 50—cent increase. It’s
simple, really. With less Mark IIIs
on the road, Prius owners have
more of it to themselves. Maybe
they’ll shut up'now.

Not only is that fantastic in it-

-self, but less cars on the road also

leads to 
Less 

risky business. There were about
38,500 road trafﬁc deaths in the

United States  2006. And if

~ you’re between 21 and 24 years

old, you ﬁt the demographic for
being most likely to be involved in
a fatal auto crash. And according
to an estimate prepared for Time
Magazine, if gas prices stay more
than $4 per gallon for the next 12
months, we can expect roughly
1,000 less accidents every single

- month.

‘ Less Mark IIIs on the road also
contributes to...

Less Pollution
Oh yeah, all you fuzzy green,
environmental types will love this
one. Not only do we live in the city
that was rated as having the worst
air quality in the country by the
American Lung Association, but
. wait, isn’t that enough? Well
it’s also supposed to cut down on
the of deaths caused by

 on-iielateclpg-i illnesses to the
L S "tune-off'2,000 woiild-be5goners*in
Riding -iniian automobile is, A ‘

thenexti year. 
What else can the Mark IIIs
low mileage provide you? How

about. . .

The Four-Day Work Week
That’s right. You’ve dreamt
about it. You’ve half—seriously
suggested it to all your friends.
Now it’s real. In an effort to save
money and resources, about 80
percent of Utah’s state workers
are seeing mandatory switches to
four—day work weeks. Although
many states are beginning to offer

the option of the four—day week,"

Utah is the ﬁrst to institute it as
mandatory policy on a large scale.
The projected beneﬁts? Ac-
cording to Brevard Community
College President Jim Drake,
whose Florida school utilized the
four—day week last year for its sum-
mer session, more than $250,000
in energy costs were cut, and the
amount of sick leaves I taken by
employees nearly dropped in half.
If you don’t want a -Mark III by
now... '
I give up. They’re really quite
stylish for their size. Oh yeah, and
you can save money on your car

j insurance.

Since we harbor a shared ob-
jection to parting with our cash, I
know you’ll like this one. Since I’m
not driving my hypothetical Mark
III to work anymore and instead
riding my bike, I now qualify for a
change in auto insurance status.

By using Geico.com’s online
quote generator, I ran my infor-
mation through once as someone
who uses public transportation to
get to work, then once again as
someone who drives to work ev-
eryday, all other details the same.
Turns out I’d save about 9 percent
in my monthly premium as a pub-
lic txansit commuter.

Now I’m out of letters.

Granted, I don’t enjoy seeing
greedy energy companies lining
their already bursting pockets by
scamming consumers, but look
at the beneﬁts: more people alive,
healthy and not ﬁlled with road-
rage. It almost seems worth it.

Brandon will be near the In-and-Out
Buger at b,€p3@_pz't2t edu.

Sometimes the best pace to
take in art is a crawl.

That’s exactly what the Pitts-
burgh Cultural Trust is banking
on - this Friday with the con-
tinuing tradition of the Gallery
Crawl in the Cultural District.

— Although past gallery crawls
have united wide-ranging exhi-

bitions and performances into‘

a complex amalgam of art, the
upshot has been exposure to
a. variety of artistic views and
enough experiences to please
the pickiest of crawlers.

This year, for example, is
the Latin music performance
by Chino Nunez in the. Katz
Plaza. Meanwhile, there’s an ex-
hibition ‘at the August Wilson
Center Gallery entitled “Black
Clay in Pa.: a Dialogue in Flux,”
which presents black art.

“Each one has its own little
niche,” said John Tronsor, an

art student at the University of
Pittsburgh.

Museum attendees more in-
fluenced by the hunger niche
will be well served by the Penn-
sylvania Culinary Institute at
808 Liberty Ave.

The institute will be showing
food art created with tallow and
sugar as well as serving refresh-

Except here, each installa-
tion is a building, and the instal-
lations are galleries reminiscent
of those in New York City. V

Another striking exhibit dis-
plays different comic book-in-
spired pieces, another remnant
of past years.

of only one aspect of contem-

‘ porary art.

The result is a strong sugges-
tion of pop art that serves as an
interesting and esoteric look at
the indie art scene.

As evidenced by the exhibit
at the future site of the August
Wilson Center, at Liberty Ave-
nue and William Penn Place, in-
terest in the community is still
present.

Eight high school students
were selected for the National
City MLK Community Mural
Project. Attendees will be able
to speak to the artists as well
as view how far the work has
come.

In another throwback to lo-
cal art projects, SPACE at 812
Liberty Ave., with the title “You
Are Here,’.’ is reminiscent of
“Life on Mars,” the current ex-
hibit at the Carnegie Museum,
with its references to the self in
relation to places and time.

experience will enjoy the many
bar scenes opening Friday.

Bars such as the Backstage
Bar are opening their doors to
attendees to hear the likes of
Dwayne Dolphin, who will be
playing a jazz set and releasing
his CD.

The best part? No admission
fees.

Which isn’t the case for the
crawl’s flagship bash, located
on top of the Theatre Square
Parking Garage.

Titled “Cosmopolitan Pitts-
burgh,” this swank bash is only
available through tickets priced
from $30 to $100, and purchase
is preferable in advance.

Although each gallery and
performance alone is valuable,
all of them coming together
might seem daunting to the ca-
sual artist.

However, this shouldn’t de-
ter anyone, as the exhibits are
all free and worth at least a
look.

My Chemical Romance’s T/ye Bkzaé Parade it
Dead is an album recorded live in New Mexico,
with all the vocal shortcomings and screaming
fans you can handle The crowd seems to serve
only as the band’s afﬁrmation that it has fans
at all — MCR doesn’t even acknowledge them

until the 13th track, when lead singer Gerard ‘

Way ﬁnally asks how the audience is doing.
The album revolves around a character the
band calls “the Patient” as he dies and looks
back on his life It plays out like an overdrawn
movie death scene you wish would end -- all
thevviolent  you can handle, mixed in
with the auditory chaos of questionable instru-
mentation and pacing. As much as MCR resents
the emo brand it’s been labeled with, it’s not do-

 

ing anything to help the problem.

Rather, the album exacerbates it,ilike 
a heavy bleeder lots of alcohol and Tylenol. It
doesn’t sound so much like a sob story of a dy-
ing, patient or a critique of modern affairs In-
stead, it’s like an overdone parody of emo mu-
sic — imagine a music documentary cross-bred
with “Meet the Spartans.” The  warble so
much that the music itself borders on the dis-
tasteﬁi]. « '

Sometimes the lyrics become lost through
the screaming crowd and Gerard Way’s breathy,
screamy delivery — he often sounds out of
breath,  lyrics like ‘Marna we all go to
hell/Mamaweallgo tohell/Pmwritingthis
letter and wishing you well / Mama we all go
to h ” How can these guys say they’re not an
emo band with lyrics like these?

' “Cancer” is the only track on the whole
album that features any emotion and genuine
singing on \X/ay’s part He’s actually quite good,
and it’s a shame that the rest of the band doesn’t
match it The other members seem content with
the traditional punk—rock fare of near-falsetto

vocals  like a prepubescent teen’s voice

The only feeling that comes with this CD
is emptiness The album is emotionally empty
— the songs don’t - provoke any thought or
emotion other than the need to   the
kitchen drawer for something sharp.

This album just shows‘ the lack of effort
that MCR is  to devote to its music and
its fans It feels like a quick way for it to cash in
on its success, and the result is as insulting as it is
lame If you do decide to give this a listen, take
\X7ay’s advice from the first track: “Get me the
hell outta here!” i

We
need 
you.

Hot dog—eating contest as American as they come

    

by Adam Littman
Senior Staﬂ’ IV/‘iter-

  

I’ve been a lucky sports fan
through my ﬁrst 20 years of life.

I’ve had the honor of visiting
Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park.
I’ve seen legendary athletes like Ken
Griffey Jr. and Barry Bonds in per-
son. I’ve even been to a \World Series

game in which President Bush threw
out the first pitch, and, while in the
upper deck, I was joined not only by
thousands of baseball fans but also
by hundreds of secret service men
wielding sniper riﬂes.

But that was all practice leading
up to this past Friday, when I went
to the Nathan’s Famous Fourth of
July International Hot Dog—Eating
Contest;

Started in 1916, this hot dog—eat-
ing contest is the apex of competitive
eating. It’s held every year on July 4
and celebrates two of America’s fa-
vorite  eating and America

The big storyline heading into
the event was the rematch between
Takeru Kobayashi, a former champi-

on, and Joey Chestnut, who won last
year's contest and ended Kobayashi’s
streak of ﬁve consecutive titles.

The two men were positioned in
the center of the long table facing the
crowd. There might have been 19
other competitors, but all eyes were
on these two men.

Not a sport you say? Quite the
opposite

It’s not just a sport of strategy,
talent and the will power to con-
tinue when you don’t feel you can
anymore, it’s a sport of quick hands,
strong throats and elastic waistbands.
It also knows how to put on a spec-
tacle worth attending _

Even hours before the first bite
was taken, the people  the
contest made sure to keep the fans
entertained. They combined aspects
from other professional sports that
we love into their pre-contest cel-
ebrations.

A group of four cheerleaders
danced onstage and used T-shirt can-
nons to shoot shirts to the crowd.
They were all dressed in identical red
tank tops and white skirts.

There was a dance contest be-

tween two mascots: an old Nathatfs
hot dog and a new one. The older
mascot won the dance—off, but both
stayed around the rest of the day.

It was clear that on this July 4
the fans in attendance were more
than pleased with their holiday plans.
George Shea, the emcee for the
event, said an estimated 35,000 peo-
ple came to Coney Island — home
to the original Nathan’s contest —or
as he called the area, the “Madison
Square Garden of Gurgitation.”

Although the sun was tucked
away behind a crowd of clouds, the
beginning of the contest prompted
a sea of yellow to fill the sky, thanks
to thunder sticks handed out by Na-
than’s.

Thanks to logical positioning, it
was easy to keep an eye on Kobayashi
and Chestnut and even easier to see
just how differently they ate.

Kobayashi eats in a much more
machine-like manner. He bends
slightly and barely moves 
but his arms, except occasionally
hopping_or quickly jerking his head
backward like a child who just learned
how to swallow a pill.

Alternatively, Chestnut might have
the most active swallow of anybody
in history. As he bites into each dog,
he stands upright, then shoots his up-
per half forward,  it look like
he’s either sneezing or about to give
the fans a souvenir in the form of
some partially chewed food. '

\While chewing, Chestnut bobs
up and down, occasionally jumping
in place a few times to help every-
thing go down. Take that, Sir Isaac
Newton.

The crowd loves it The cheering
doesn’t stop. In fact, it only grows
louder. A man behind calls his ﬁiend
to gloat

“Dude, you’re really missing out.
This is without the doubt the greatest
10 minutes in sports.”

Both men also cover their
mouths. It’s probably to make sure
nothing comes out, but there’s also
the chance thevre just two guys with
good manners Either way, both men
are well ahead of the other competi-
tors and endthe 10-minute regula-
tion tied with 59 hot dogs.

That’s when Shea announced it
was time for a dog—off A man stand-

ingto myleftwasgivinghis friend
updates over the phone.

‘They tied! It’s a dog—off! Hmm,
I don’t really know what mat is, hold
on a sec.”

Actually, a dog—off is an overtime
period where the man who eats five
hot dogs first is the winner: The dogs
were brought out, we counted down,
and the town men plunged tlrerri?
selves into the plates

They used their same night-and-
day techniques, and, in less than a
minute, we had a winner.

After piling everything into his
mouth, Chestnut raised his arms
in victory, but only for a second. It
must’ve been at that point that he
realized he had remnants of five hot
dogs crowded in his mouth, just itch-
ing to escape. He covered up and was
awarded the mustard—colored belt. 

As he accepted his belt a “USA.”
chant broke out, and thunder sticks
banged away. It concluded an Inde-
pendence Day ﬁlled with hot dogs,
cheedeaders and mascots dressed
like hot dogs

And what’s more American than
that?

Mike Cook, a guard/for-
ward on the Pitt men’s basket-
ball tearn, is still awaiting a deci-
sion from the NCAA regarding
his request for a sixth year of
eligibility-

Cook, who tore the ACL and
medial and lateral menisci in his
left knee Dec. 20 against Duke
at Madison Square Garden, sat
out one year after transferring to
Pitt from East Carolina in 2005.

“It’s all up to the doctor and

Pitt’s Safritt fails to qualify

by Emily Steiner
Staﬂ W/riter _

Pitt’s Stacie Safritt didn’t make the Olym-
pic swim team, but at least she got to swim
against Dana Torres.

And with a story like Torres’, who is
sprinting on her ﬁfth Olympic swim" team
at the age of 41, it’s clear that Safritt, a Pitt
