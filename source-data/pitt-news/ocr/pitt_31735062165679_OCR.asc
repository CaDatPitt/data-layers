are not blindto the advantages
of a more liberal approach to the
question of alcohol. On this same
page is printed a letter’from a
Presbyterian minister admonish-
ing the religious associations of
the Methodists and of his own
denomination for their stand on
the alcohol proposal.

I do not know in what light
his ownisuperiors will view his
actions in writing this letteribut
he is to be commended for his
rational stand on the subject.
Although he has placed major
emphasis on drinking among
college students it takes little
imagination to see’ a liberal,
realistic mind at work in a ﬁeld
which has been pla‘gued for the
past ﬁfty years by seventeenth
century -thinking.

Whether or not the church
leaders believe it or not, action
of the type demonstrated by the
M-e t-h o d i s t and Presbyterian
churches here in ‘Pittsburgh is
driving away more people from
Sunday services than it is at-
tracting them. '

No Man Goes Out

No. man who goes out Satur-
day night with his wife to a
nightclub and has a few drinks
is going to want to sit in church
the next morning and be admon-
ished for what is to him harm-
less ‘and enjoyable relaxation.

One can only hope for the
sake of. organized Protestantism
that our letter writing minister
is not alone and that soon the
church leaders will realize the
hopelessness of their position
and follow the example of the
Catholic Church in the estab-
lishment of a realistic alcohol
policy. ‘

‘Minister Defends :
Drinking ~On Campus
Editor, The Pitt News
As an ordainedminister and a
Pitt graduatestudent, let m_e say
that I was shocked and amazed
_to learn that ministerial. asso-
ciations of both the Presbyter_ia'n
-and the‘ Methodist Churches
have gone onrecord against the
use of alcohol on the Pitt cam-
pus. _ '.

inary and having my own wist-
ful memories of enjoyable eve-
nings atthe. pub with my fellow
students, who are now pr'esum-
ably’ among the

am‘ doubly shocked and triply
amazed. .
Of course there are few safer

subjects for apreacher to attack .

than drinking among the young

enough of them in his congrega-
tion anyway, and, the older par-

out of this_ courageous stand

‘against sin——a kick which will

prevent at‘ least some of them
from savoring other kicks that
have more kick.

But still, one wondersiwhat

'the reverend gentlemen had on

their minds. Don’t they under-
stand that the Eighteenth

Amendment is dead—thank God ‘

—-and that it is utterly impos-
sible to run a society as nerve-
wracking as this one without
the greatest inedicant for the re-
lief of tension known to man?
And don’t they understand——
what is more to the point—
that college students are as cap-
able as anyone else in that so-
ciety of making considered and

intelligent decisions, and that’

youth in“ itself does not serve
as sufficient justification for the
attempted exercise of _an eccle-
control over, the de-
cisions of youth-—_the sort of

all too often -found itself ﬁght-
ing the last‘ war but one, ‘and
it has a stinging series of ‘both
intellectual and social defeats to
show for this propensity.

erations, if no others, will ‘sway _

Football Program
Labeled Failure

Editor, The Pitt News V
Being season ticket holders for

I

_the past six years, and before

that as an evening school stu-
dent supporter for three or four
years, we felt that it would in-
terest you to know how we feel
about Pitt football. ‘

' In spite of the tremendous
progress being made by the Uni-
versity in its many endeavors,
and the resulting growth of the
university ‘image, 15itt has failed
miserably in one of the surest
image«builders,' the football pro-
gram. ' j _ .

Like it or not, the relative suc-
cess of your football team is one
of the greatest single‘ factors in

promoting this image both 10-
cally and nationally. This im-
age, which a, few years ago be-
ganto show signs of a rebirth,
has‘ now P deteriorated to an
alarming level. '

During the seasons’ of ’56_ and"

’57 things looked rather promis-
ing,‘ b_ut since; then ‘they’ have
gone from bad to worse. Thellast
three seasons have really ‘been

_ _ -’ bad .with “omy 12 ‘wins ,out"o_f
of which theyoughjt‘: ' ‘ .  C ‘  ’
olations by-

ging attendance that has come in -
_these years‘ is proof enough that
there are many who do not care '
to support the p_resent prograrn.

Rather than join the ranks of
the missing without tellingwhy,

‘ we are going on record that we

will not be season ticket holders’
in 1963‘ if the present coaching
is retained. We are taking this

position’, not because we ‘are anti‘
.anyone or anything, but because

we are 100 per ‘cent for _Pitt.

We ask that the ‘University
take the necessary’ steps to give
football the sorely needed lead-
ership, so that, along ‘with-us,
the many other ‘fans canreturn
to support a revitalized pro-
gram. With this a reality, the

’@prv_estige of _a growing football

‘image would certainly compli-

ment the academic stature now

being ' attained at Pitt. "V

Editor, The Pitt News a ,

It has recently come to my
attention that the University has
failed to take any action as yet
on the alcohol proposal passed
by your Student Government
over amonth ago. When I at-
tended Pitt much the same sit-
uation confronted the student
body as does now. Of course,

V ,1; BRING yous CONTAINER

By J0 NELSON

Through the University
placement service, Sue
Roberts, sophomore psychol-
ogy major, has secured a rare
job with the Juvenile Court

in Pittsburgh. She works, four

afternoons a week supervising
recreational activities of adoles-
cents held in the detention home
before their trials. ‘

The detention home, located at
3333 Forbes Avenue, occupies the
stories of the Juvenile
Court Building. It houses 80 to 90
boys and anywhere from 20 to 50
girls at one time. The children,

-kept from a week to a month,

await trial for offenses as small as
running away from home and as

‘major as murder, Sue reported.

The recreational program of -the
home is divided into three sec-
tions. The sehior division, for the
most well adjusted boys and girls
between the ages of 13 and 18, is
supervised by Miss Roberts. Also
there is a shop and a kitchen pro-
gram. The senior division is the
only program which combines
boys and girls.

Supervised Games

The recreational program car-
ried on up until this September
for the senior division, consisted
merely of supervised games. Sue
ltoolk over in September and was
given the opportunity to revise
lithe program in any way she
saw ﬁt.

She stated her goal as a de-
sire to help children be sociable
with each other and with adults
on a very natural and unco-
erced level. In order to achieve
such a goal. she never “bosses"
them and puts them under no
pressure to conform. She hopes
in this way to get them to re-
late more freely to each other
and to her.

The
charge,
books

she tried distributing
and magazines, group
games and group- discussions.
“But,” she Said, “groups don't
work out because the children are
often quite anti-,socia1.”
Individual Treatment
She is now trying a more indi-
vidual treatment of each child.
Some of them don’t show any
progress at all during the short
time they are there, but many
come out of their shells and
really warm up, she commented.
Sue feels that all in all her
method has been successful.
However, she says that she is
hampered by the lack of sup-
plies. She would like to provide
records, pets. and piano, and a.
library for the children but

“funds for this purpose are un-

available.

Miss Roberts said that after
their trials, some of the children
are returned to their own homes,
others are placed in foster homes,
some are sent to reform school or
work camp, those over 18 may be
sent to prison, and many are com-
mitted to mental institutions.

THE GREAT SCHISM -

Duquesne Uni_versity and Pitt getalong. like glycerol:

and nitric acid. .
The athletic department here has been the landlord of
the Dukes ever since that abandoned‘ carbarn known‘ -as
_Duquesne Gardens was razed to provide high—priced apart-
ments for the Pitt faculty. , I I
The neighboring school has been a vassal of this
school ever since“ They are permitted to play their
“home” games on the Field House floor although they
still must practice onthe court that Parker Bros. built
I ' ‘ I for them on The Bluﬁ.
An intense rivalry between
the two schools has.develop-
ed.The one delights in boo-
ing the other. Although Pitt
has always held the real
estate edge,’ the Dukes have
always fared better on the 94

  

to them.

The Dukes forget .
every winter that Pitt "is
the kingdom. Because in
basketball they do the
ruling and the Panthers

Bob Timmons , merely carry their train.
Because of the intense jingoism of the respective schools,
the schools refuseto schedule each other in basketball». They
fear a mass riot on the hardwood. ’ '
Instead,Cthey have cooked up a scheme called the Steel
Bowl tournament that allows them to play each other every
year. This enables both athletic directorsto washtheir hands
‘of any resulting misfortunes since neither planned the affair.
' Duquesne and Pitt have been involved in nine Steel \‘
Bowls. _Each'one. always meets a visiting team in the first
round and inevitably -end, up playing eachother. They
have done this ‘eight times.‘ Pitt has championed the tour-
ney three times. '
1’ William &'i Mary and Boston College have been ‘invited
here this. time to meet in the consolation match. Publicist
Beano Cook ﬂipped a coin a few times to determine the pair-

 ings. Everything about this tournament is that informal.

_f

'We’ll assume that the Dukes andthe Panthers will
meet in the finals.‘ Otherwise there’s no sense in holding a
the tournament. ‘ f _
Last year was Duquesne’s year. And they only won, 73-
70. This supposedly is the Panther’s year. They\have a veter-
an ball club. Coach Red Manning is bemoaning the play of
his all-sophomore front line that is undefeated.
Coach Bob Timmons is on the spot; i.e. if athletic director
Frank Carver thinks basketball is,a better prestige sport

\.~" than tennis. He should ,win. Manning seems to have little

in

_ ords for most- points‘ infa career

,iPanther basketball scoring rec-

control over his team ‘this year. If they don’t know what to
do with the ball, they’ll heave it toward the basket.
_Timmons,_ should have some game discipline in this
outﬁt. They should becooler in a tight game than the ‘
Dukeslwho haven’t encountered one yet. And the game
will be a close affair. I
This team is as good as the one that was 18-7 in 1957,
according to Timmons. If they beat the Dukes in the Steel

 ,g\Bow‘l they’ll be 4-1 and on their way to such a mark. Tim-

mons says Duquesne should beat Boston College. He said
nothingabout William & Mary’s chances.
I “If we don’t get into a tournament this year,” said
Brian Generalovich, the team’s' co-ca’ptain,_“we’ll never
go-anywhere, next year. _What difference does a year
make? Last year we were sophomores. This is the year!” 7

Visitors Lose

The last time a visiting team
won the Steel Bowl was in 1954
when George Washington defeat-
ed Duquesne, 71-64. The Dukes
lead with ﬁve titles am: Pitt has
three. And there‘ have been some

class opposition: Duke, St. John’s, .

Wake Fosest and Bradley.

William & Mary shouldn’t be
considered too lightly this Fri-
day. They lost on the road last
Saturday to Virginia" Tech by
six points when they were 18
point under-dogs. Connecticut
downed Boston College the same
. night.

The Panthers are the only ex-
perienced team in the tourney.
This is a rebuilding year for Red
Manning at Duquesne, but they
sported a 3-0 record prior to last
night’s game with\Georgetown.

Boston Builds

Boston College is also starting
anew. They ‘iave los‘; two of the
East’s top players: forward Jim

Swimmers Oppose Princeton
"In Initial Meet at Trees Hall

By FRED MARCUS

Next trimester, when there are changes of academic
courses, the course of Ben Grady’s swimming team, set to
start January 5, will be unaltered: “We’re aiming for Prince-
ton,” said co-captain Rich Rush.

The Panthers test their skills against those of the Ivy
Leaguers at Trees Hall pool at 8 p.m. on that day.

Grady has high respect for the¢

Princeton club. “They’re an ex-
ceptionally strong, well-balanced
club, and one of the ﬁve best in
the East,” he noted. The Tigers
are the defending Eastern Col-
legiate Champions and were ﬁfth
in team scoring last season in
the NCAA tournament.

Several swimmers from the Ivy

League squad who will face the

high in last year’s NCAA tourna-
ment:

‘ Gordon Green posted a third

in the 200-yard breast stroke,
and second in the 100-yard
breaststroke; Jed Graef, a sec-
ond in the 100-yard back-
stroke; John Andrews, an
eighth in the three-meter spring
board event and a ninth in the

one-meter dive; and the 400-

yard medley relay team quali-
‘ﬁed second in the finals.

As for the individual swim-
mers and events, Grady com-
mented, “They’re all tough.”

The records from this meet
will be the first ones established

Junior halfback Paul Martha
proved to be the Panther’s most

The Shadyside Academy grad-

with 44, passes received with 12,
yardage gained on pass receptions
with 246, and yards returned of
kickoffs, punts, and interceptions
with 140, 23 and 54 yards respec-
tively.

In addition to these marks he
also threw one touchdown pass
and was third on the team in
rushing with 351 yards for a 4.5
average.

Gymnasts Weak in Two Places 

By AL BLUNIKIN

The gymnastics team has
been working out daily in an
effort to plug up glaring
weaknesses which have been
apparent for a while. While
there is depth on the appara-

tus, two other events shape up as
the main problems for this coming
season which will open at Syra-
cuse on January 12.

.The two weak events are the
free exercise and the still rings.
The former strength the team
possessed in the face exercise
was decimated by the loss of

EIGL champion and All-Amer-
ican Earl McConnell.
McConnell took ﬁrsts in virtual-

ly every meet and is a big loss in
this event. His replacement is
Jack Schwar, a sophomore.
Schwar has been improving with
every workout, but cannot hope
to "make up for McConnell’s loss.
The still rings are the other
event that pose a. problem. Here
again the loss of‘ McConnell is
a blow. McConnell was also the
number one man in the still
rings.
A The top man in this event could
be Ed Zamecnik who worked it
several times last year.

Zamecnik, however, is tops on

the horizontal bar and concen-
trates mainly on that event. Soph-
omore Bill Shenefelt, who is in
the same situation as Schwar, will
probably be number one here.

If Coach Warren Neiger can
develop Schwar and Shenefelt into
solid men in the free exercise and

still rings the team will have a

good chance to be one of the best ,‘
in the East.
