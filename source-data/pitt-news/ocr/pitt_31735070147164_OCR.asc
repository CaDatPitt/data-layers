The restaurant location, which

President Obama proposes streamlined budget» if

2 - 5 Andrew Zaj ac
Tribune Washington Bureau (MCT)

President Barack Obama on Monday pro-
posed a new federal budget that is $90 bil-
lion smaller than the one he offered last
year and includes a combination of cuts
and revenue increases aimed at chopping

$1.1 trillion from the national deﬁcit over .

10 years.

The president’s $3.73—trillion spending
plan cuts many popular programs, while in-
creasing spending in selected education and
infrastructure programs designed to bolster
the nation’s economic competitiveness.

The administration plans to expand Pell
Grants to an estimated 9 million more col-
lege students, but would ﬁnance the grants
through a $100-billion package of savings
that could make it harder for some students
to ﬁnance their education. The changes
would eliminate the availability of the grants
for summer students and increase the costs
of graduate school loans by having interest
begin to accrue while students are in still in
school, rather than after they graduate.

Officials also said the budget would in-
clude funding to bring high—speed Internet
access to 98 percent of Americans and pre-
pare for 100,000 new science and math
teachers, but they offered few details on
timing or ﬁnancing. '

in what is certain to be a long and bruis-
ing debate on spending with congressional
Republicans, who already have signaled a
desire for much sharper cuts.

Not all of the deﬁcit reduction will come
in the form of spending cuts. Obama is also

The administration plans to expand Pell V .
Grants to an estimated 9 million more
college students, but would finance the   ~
grants through a $100 billion package of

savings... A 8

The new budget seeks to shrink the na-
tional deﬁcit from an estimated 7 percent

‘ of gross domestic product this year to 3.2

percent in 2015, maintaining it at roughly
that level through 2021.

In demonstrating a wlillingnessyto make
cuts,,Obama hopes to seize the initiative

proposing an end to tax breaks enacted un-
der former President George W. Bush for
the nation’s wealthiest earners. About two-
thirds of the deﬁcit reduction over the next
10 years would come from the combination
of these cuts. The rest would come from
revenue increases.

i

Still, key House Republicans, reacting '

to leaks and previews of the budget, pre-
dicted that it won’t cut nearly enough to
satisfy them. . 3 ‘

House Speakerjohn Boehner, an Ohio Re-
publican, dismissed Obama’s ﬁve—year freeze
o_n discretionary spending as inadequate
because it was preceded by two budgets
with large spending increases.» A ‘

‘-‘Locking in that level of spending is way
too much,” Boehner said Sunday on-NBC’s
“Meet the Press.” ' v - ‘ ' - '

Another key House Republican, Budget
Committee chairman Paul Ryan of Wiscon-

. sin, said any spending increase would come

under tough scrutiny.

“If he is talking about coming and having _

new spending, so-called investments, that is
‘not where we are going,” Ryan said on Fox
News Sunday. . A _ .

Ryan noted a new dynamic in Congress
working in favor of leaner budgets.

“A year ago, Congress was debating about
how much more spending to increase,” Ryan
said. “Now we are debating about how much

more spending to cut,” he said. I

Eat’n Park 4 1

place on city property like Schenley Plaza.
The Eat’n Park Hospitality Group received
ﬁnal approval for the project last October,
after making a number of changes in its
design that lowered building Walls and
provided for more open spaces.

The new plan for the restau-rant’s con-
struction —- after the delay from city ap-
proval — called for groundbreaking in
early spring, Broadhurst said.

When the Plaza opened in 2005, it in-
cluded plansthat would place an Eat’n
Park near the corner of Forbes and Big-
elow, Morton Brown, the city’s public art
director, said in an interview last year. The
original developer for the space backed
out, and Eat’n Park stepped in with a pro-
posal early last year. , .

For a project like the one on Schen-
ley Plaza to move forward, it had to go
through a series of approvals by the city
Art Commission.

The ﬁrs_t phase is a conceptual phase in
which a general idea'is presented. At this
point there is some idea of the budget,
intended materials and approval of the
land, Brown said.

Once past this phase, if the concept is
well—received, planning moves forward
and more documents and designs are pre-
sented, Brown said.

This was where the Eat’n Park faced
some setbacks, he said.  . 

“The design was good, but we wanted

the design to be more open and inviting
—- to fit in better with the landscape. We
also wanted more natural materials to

» be used,” Brown said. “There is actually

a completely green bathroom next door
and we wanted the structure to fit in more
with that theme.” «

Construction to start  
soon on restaurant

After Eat’n Park made the changes,

the commission gave conceptual approval .

to the plans, at which point architects
and engineers created construction docu-
ments, then re—approached the board for
ﬁnal approval. '

Construction can begin now‘ that the
Art Commission has given its approval.
But this is not the end of the commission’s
involvement. ’

“Once built, the Art Commission re-
evaluates the structure to insure that it
was built as described in the approved
documents,” Brown said.

Schenley Plaza — despite having Uni-

versity buildings on three sides,—‘,is not

a part of Pitt’s campus; it is part of the
Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy. "But Pitt
spokesmanjohn Fedele said the University
does support the construction.

“The University was not involved, but”

we are pleased to see the development
taking place,” he said. «
Although the chain of restaurants is
popular, not all Pitt students + fresh-
man Nora Perry included — have heard
of the new construction. Others thought
that the restaurant might change their
eating habits. V . '
“The freshmen 15 has a new face,” Perry
said after learning about the restaurant.
“But I am excited about it.” A
At the same time, some students, like

‘sophomore Rob Walker, don’t view the

construction favorably.

“I am not a fan,” Walker said. “Schenley
Plaza is beautiful and adding a restaurant
like that is only going" to increase foot and
road traffic in an already busy area, and
it’ll almost definitely mean an increase in
litter in that area.” I

Current career-tracking
methods sufficient

Everyone shouldhaveaccesstoacollege
education, right? A bachelor’s degree
usually leads to a higher salary and a
better quality of life — shou1dn’t all
young people have the chance to reap
those beneﬁts?

Well, according to the authors of

a new report out of Harvard Univer— ,

sity’s Graduate School of Education,
America’s so—called “college for all”
philosophy demands revision._
Aggregating a host of recent data
from differentsources, the 2011“Path-
way to Prosperity” report by the Har-
vard University Graduate School of
Business shows that7o percent ofU.S.
highschool students proceedtocollege

“withintwoyearsofgraduating.Only56

percent of those who attend four-year
colleges complete their coursework in
six years. Of all current 27-year—olds in
the country, only 40 percent have as-
sociate degrees or higier. The authors
are afraid that the alarming college
drop-out rates could soon lead to a
depressing historical anomaly —-— that
ﬁitnre generationswillbeless educated,
percentage-wise, thantheir parents.
Insteadoftryingto pushmoreyoung

I people into college andtoboostdegree

completion rates —-— an idea that hasn’t
proven successﬁ1l——the authors ofthe
report conclude that the K-12 system
should emphasize vocational schooling
and provide more comprehensive ca-
reercounseling. Theyofferthe model of
WesternEunope, whose countries boast
better-establishedvocational—training
programs and involve more students in

‘ suchprogramsthanthe United States.

In one strikingexample, morethanso
percent of Swiss high school students

participate in programs that combine ‘

school work with employment—based
training. The Harvard researchers con-
tendthatsuch career-centered second-

ary education accounts for the higher ,

educational-completion rates generally
seen in Western Europe — both for
high school and college students. -

The contrasts between the United
States’ shortcomings and the advances
of foreigners is typically not easy to
swallowforalargelyxenophobic, “buy
American”-believingpublic. ButEurope
mighthavelessonstoteachthebuilders
of our educational futiire —— though
they’re lessons that policymakers and
school administrators should hesitate
to adopt.

Judging from our own experience,
we thinkthe authors correctly deﬁned
the problem — high schools today,

‘ both public and private, focus more on

preparingstudents forcollege thanfor
careers. When facingthe pressure that
comes with the AP system, No Child
Left Behind and lowering land values
, more school districts are designing
curriculato help studentspasstestsand
get into prestigious colleges. Whereas
European students viewhigh schoolas
a career necessity, Americans see it as
nothingmorethanacoginthe college-

, admission machine.

Butno one’s exclaiming,“Let’st11m
our country into Germany.” Infact, do-
ingsowouldbeethically negligent. Ac-
cordingtothereport, theGermanpre—
professional/apprenticeship training
program separates children intocareer

tracksasearlyasmiddleschool—and .

this is apractice we should avoid.
A greater emphasis on career-

' tracking during high school might

open broader educational doorsas
the authors suggest, but it runs a ﬁne
line. A tracking program that’s too in-
vasive— onethattakes decidingpower
fromthe students andtheirfamilies—-
runs contraryto the American Dream.

It might be true that IQ scores at age

7 are strongly predictive of IQ at age
23, but that doesn’t mean that when a
child is7, acommittee of ofﬁcials should
chwse where he’ll be working on his
23rd birthday. The tactthat college stu-
dents oftenmakebad career decisions
and change their minds might underlie
their dismal graduation-rates, but pre-
cludingyoungpeople frombeingableto
manifesttheirown destiny insults what

/ makes this country so special.

Another issue is that — at least for
the technical schools that currently
operate in the United States -— enroll-
ment seems disproportionately ﬁlled
with certain racial and socioeconomic
groups. Many students also see voca-
tionalt1ainingasthething“dumbpeo—
ple”‘do. Such problems must be ﬁxed
beforeasweepingreorganization ofthe
educational system is attempted.

Considering the care that must be
taken to satisfy the ethical concerns
and to reduce the stigma of technical
schools,bringingthe Germanvocation—

Kenny Ongl Staff Photographer

Columnist Mark Kozlowski believes Pitt rightfully chose not to deprive Chick—ﬁl-A of its home on the
ground ﬂoor of the Cathedral after activists accused the national chain of discrimination.

A MIDWESTERN PIECE

hick—f1l—A should stay    

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

 

Who would think free sandwiches
would be so controversial?
Accordingto the NewYorkTimes,
the chicken sandwiches Chick—ﬁl-A
donated to an event hosted by the an-
ti-gay-marriage Pennsylvania Family
Institute have caused quite a stir, and
the ﬁrm is underﬁre for selling“Jesus
Chicken,” among other things.
Others are calling on major uni-
versities to pull Chick—ﬁl-A from
their campuses —- a call echoed by
members of Pitt’s Rainbow Alliance
earlier this month. Pitt has no plans

° _to remove Chick—ﬁl-A.

Now, I make no claims as to
whether Chick—ﬁl-A is correct to sup-
port groups opposing gay marriage.
I make no claims about gay marriage
itself. Yet I believe‘ the University is
correct to ignore the call to remove
Chick—ﬁl-A from campus eateries. The
reason not to remove the restaurant
boils down to one word — choice.

. The argument against Chick—ﬁl-A

takes the form "of another word —- .

discrimination. The argument goes

that the ﬁrm discriminates against
gays by making a donation to an an-
ti—gay~marriage group, and that Pitt
implicitly supports discrimination by
allowing Chick—ﬁl-A’s campus opera-
tions to continue. Let me ask an im-
portant question: How does donating
food or money to a cause constitute
discrimination? It is discrimination
only in that sandwiches went to one

. group and not another.

How is this form of discrimina-
tion any differentfrom the sort of
discrimination we all engage in every
day? We discriminate against Star-
bucks when we buy from Caribou,
we discriminate against the March
of Dimes when we contribute to the
American Cancer Society, we dis-
criminate against the Catholic Church .
if we attend a Protestant service. We
have limited resources, and we can’t
please everybody. Therefore we aim
to-assist those people who share our
views and who give us satisfaction
for our time and money. So we dis-
criminate or -— if you prefer a less
ugly word —— we choose.
Corporations are likewise lim-
ited in their resources, and so they
must choose which causes to back.

Discrimination is only bad when it
violates the rights of others. Chick-
ﬁl—A’s donation to a particular group
violates nobody’s rights, unless you
claim every person and every group
has a right to free chicken sand-
wiches.

, What about the argument that the
group Chick—ﬁl-Awas supportingwas
odious because it was anti—rights?
The best way to answer this is by anal-
ogy. Suppose I ﬁnd out that a ﬁrm
doing business on the Pit campus,
call it Cow-pat-E, donated to a promi-
nent gun-control advocacy group. I
demand Cow-pat-E be expelled from
campus because it donated to a group

them, whereas gay marriage is good
and a right. But this very rejoinder
is testimony to the fact that there is
disagreement over what our rights
are vis—a—vis gay marriage and gun
ownership. Despite existing debate,
it is dreadfully undemocratic to de-
mand policies intended to punish the
side with which We disagree.

Thisis not to say that what Chick-

BTQA community isn’t justiﬁed in
taking action. Rainbow Alliance is
more than welcome to boycott the

boycott and stand outside a Chick-

demanding that colleges remove the
chain because of who they donated
food to is not justiﬁable, because it
limits choice.

Right now, someone who is of-
fended by the actions of Chick-ﬁl—A

canchoose to boycott. Someone who ’

shares Chick-ﬁl-A’s values, is indif-
ferent toward them or likes the food
so much that he doesn’t care is free
to choose to eat there. If the chain
were removed, nobody would have
any choice. Furthermore, removal
of the chain sends the message that
expressingan opinion differentﬁom
an official one about gay marriage will
not be tolerated. The .corporation’s
choices would thus be limited.

Pitt is right to welcome those who
are opposed to gay marriage and
want to patronize a ﬁrm that feels
the same way, as well as students who
wish to engage in dissent by demo-
cratic means such as protesting and
boycotting.

Youriboss is always watching

Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

Follow me around withwa micro-
phone all day and I will say things
that I would never dream of writing
in a column. There wouldn’t be any
anti-Semitic diatribes or anything of
that sort, but there would probably
be afew politically incorrect, cringe-

worthy asides on which I wouldn’t

want to be judged.

I’d guess most people would feel
the same. _Yet as our privacy contin-
ues to fall by the wayside in a world
of microphones, cameras and social
networking, our freedom to express
these kinds of thoughts keeps de-

creasing. In the age-ofYouTube, you .

never know who is watching.
Just afew weeks ago, notable Brit-

‘ ish sportscasterAndy Graywasﬁred

in a perfect example of our shrinking

autonomy. In an off-air aside to afel- '

low announcer ina response to what
he perceived as abad callbyafemale
referee, he said, “Women don’_t know
the offside rule.” A video later sur-

facedofhimtellingafemalecolleague '

to tuck his microphone pack into his
waistband while in the presence of
another male sportscaster.

The comment is pretty mild as

far as sexism goes -— the portrayal

of Daphne from Scooby-Doo as a
clueless, attractive dunce seems
like restricting women’s suffrage in
comparison. And the video, while de-
monstrative of inappropriate, direct
workplace sexism, makes Gray seem
like he’s tryingto be “one of the guys”
rather than committing a deliberate
put-down of a lesser sex.

But even if you disagree with
this interpretation of the nature‘ of

his comments, a fact remains — an.

employee was ﬁred for comments

which were not meant to be heard
by a broader audience. It falls into

the same category as water—cooler’

talk and forwarded j okes among'col-
leagues. ‘
The company in question, Sky
‘ Sports, was completely within its
legal rights in this decision to ﬁre
—— barring a decision based on race,
age, gender, religion or ethnicity, a

standards it wishes. But the ﬁring,
nonetheless,’ sets an uncomfortable
precedent. ' '

But with the Facebook situation,
we can still go to those parties; We can

i still act like ourselves. It is this new

level of scrutiny that is worrisome. ’
Intheagewhere“news”an “mul-

humor attempts, and at the worst
mild sexism. There was no evidence
he participatedinany harsher gender
discrimination or intentionally dis-
played sexist viewpoints to damage
the reputation of the company, nor
does the company statement indicate
Gray’s behavior decreased the perfor-
mance of female workers.

These would be great reasons to
ﬁre Gray. But ﬁring him for such a
mild offenseisﬁringhimbecause his
private beliefs happened to become
public —— and this tacitly suggests
that companies have a. right to judge
people by private beliefs.

This is even harsher‘ than the
well-known practice of companies
monitoring people’s Facebook ac-
counts — those, more or less, rep-
resent the images of ourselves we
wish to project. By doing things like

artfully dodging out of pictures that '

of “fair game” can include almost our

then, expressing it is a no—go. We are
closer nowthaneverbefore to losing
the anonymity of a friendly water-
cooler conversation. This anonym-
ity — or more accurately, freedom
from retribution — is a key part of
self—expression. ,

As USC researcher Patricia Lange
noted in a20o8 paper, whenYou'Dube
users wish to express unconventional
views, they typically conceal their
identities. Nobody knows the true
origin of many popular memes. The

'whole process enables peopleto sort, ‘

out what they think, get some feed-
backand’ grow without any fear of

judgement or fallout.
Our anonymity, ironically per-
haps, is almost nonexistent except

in these situations. Unless we ex— s

press ourselves fromanonymous
usemames, the “self-actualization”
process described by Lange is very
difficult considering there ' might
be a record of it. An off—the—record,
face-to—face version, with no possible
retribution, is rare.

Somebody might get offended.An
activist might hear. The boss might
be listening.

’ It’s not that this surveillance is
particularly Orwellian '— there isn’t

A - an intent to suppress discontent. The
problem with ﬁring Gray,-the prob-

lem withmaking. everything on-the-
record, the problem with restricting
our opinions — as Facebook found-

er Mark Zuckerberg has famously .

said, to things that we would want
our “mother-in—law, supervisor, ex-
boyﬁiend, and choir director” to hear
—— is that it prevents conversations.
It prevents growth. It prevents the
controversy often needed to make

‘ advancements. .

The solution to this isn’t a legal
issue —— restricting employers’ cur-
rent broad rights to do whatever
they want isn’t ideal. Thesolution
is to acknowledge that if private be-
liefs or behaviors don’t affect profes-
sional performance, then the beliefs

are irrelevant. Even if they manifest ,

themselves in less-than-ideal ways,
we need to stop being so offended by
them and start accepting them as just
another color in the palate of beliefs
that surround us every day.

I might have more to say, but I’ll
refrain from doing, so, for now.

In addition to China’s economic
revolution, the country has also
recently experienced an evolu-
tion in art ,—‘ moving from its

traditional, realist form to ac- ’

commodate more abstract, idea-
based Western styles. Now, an

exhibition on Pitt’s campus will ‘

showcase these newfound rep-
resentations of contemporary
art.- _
Today through March 18,
members of Contrast Gallery

in Shanghai, China, will pres- ‘
~ent Mind Space: Maximalism in .

Contrasts’ in the University Art

Gallery at the Frick Fine Arts ‘

Building. The exhibition -
which has been traveling from
city to city in the United States
after beginning in Shanghai‘ —

showcases four contemporary ’

Chinese artists. a

Gao Minglu:

Gao Minglu, the exhibition’s A

curator and a professor of art

history at Pitt, explained that_

maximalism is a fairly new style,
one that has recently been gain-
ing traction in Chinese art cir-
cles.

“It has a tendencyto make

artwork in response to the sur-

.roundings by incorporating min-

imalism style with traditional
philosophy,” Minglu said.
Minglu explained that there
are two types of art in China. Re-
alism, he said,. acts as China’s

_ academic form of art‘, or:“ofﬁcial

art.” The country’s other form,
contemporary art, ‘did not de-
velop until after China had an
open policy to the West in the
late 1970s and more influences
began to trickle in.

Megan Leckie, the senior ex-

"hibition coordinator at Contrast

Gallerylin Shanghai, China, be-
lieves the exhibition is a fusion of
tradition and modernism, as well
as Eastern and Western styles.
Each artist portrays a different
aspect of this phenomenon, she
said. ' . A

“In this contemporary art, the

Chinese artists don’t see using’
tradition as a bad thing,” Leckie
said. “Any artist that’s produc-
ing art nowadays can’t turn their
back on those traditions.”

Rachel Miller, Minglu’s teach-
ing assistant, agreed.

“The artists in the show have

a connection with history —— the
Chinese history and more mod-
ern Chinese art,” said Miller, who
is doing graduate work in art and
architecture. A
One notable aspect of Chinese
contemporary art is that there
are no clear boundaries between

the political and artistic spheres. ,

The two are ‘‘totally merged,”
Minglu said.

“There’s lots of social mean-
ing involved, but the audience

might not discover it directly

from the painting,” he said.
One artist in the exhibition,

Zhang Yu, uses ﬁngerprints to .

represent everyday movements,
Leckie said. This process repre-'

FOOD COLUMN

Simkin: Pizza adish best se

rved homemade

Food columnist Sarah Simkin offers a, few pointers ‘on how to cook a superior homemade pizza

Sarah Simkin
Columnist

Here in Oakland, there’s a won-
derful variety of pizzas to choose ,

from, ranging in quality from our
$5 pics to their gourmet counter-
parts. But there’s one "pizzeria

"you might not have considered:

your own kitchen.

Preparing the quintessential
college food is easier than you
might think. ‘ ‘

For a properly crisp crust and ‘

neat slices you might want to in-
vest in a pizza stone and pizza
wheel, which dices up pies mar-
ginally easier than does a knife.
Otherwise, no special equipment
is necessary.

As for dough, my family uses
this super-simple recipe, and al-
though I’ve experimented with
more complex methods, I’m still
rather partial to it. Dissolve one
package of dry yeast into 3/4 a
cup of warm water. Stir in 1/2
teaspoon of sugar, 1/2 teaspoon

of salt, 2 tablespoons of olive oil ‘

and 1 3/4 cupsofﬂour. Knead the
mixture on a well-ﬂoured sur-
face, adding extra ﬂour if need
be to keep it from sticking. ‘

It’s usually my strategy just to,
‘ smush the dough into a roughly

circular blob on. the pizza stone
or baking sheet, but if you were
looking forward to the “spinning

although this is a homemade
concoction, there’s no need for
it to look unnecessarily homely
and awkward. The type of cheese

of pizza preparation, this is the
time to attempt it. ‘

The dough doesn’t need to
rise — you can go ‘ahead and
add the sauce and cheese (more
onthose in a moment). Bake the
pie at 400 degrees for .18 to 20
minutes, keeping a close watch
on it toward the end, lest it brown

beyond satisfactionvand into the .

realm of smokey, inedible, burnt
things that ruin your kitchen’s-
ambience.

Shredded cheese is a must —

itself — or types, goahead and
experiment with combinations
— is entirely at your discretion,

as, of course, are the toppings. ?

And with this, I offer the
same warning message'I so ve-
hemently promote with frozen

yogurt: Think about how things .
will go together before it’s too -

late. There aren’t a lot of pizza
topping combinations that would
be disastrous with each other,
but do yourself the favor of not
discovering them.

Iwillconfess that I have rare-

ly, if ever, made my own pizza

sauce from scratch, so Ihave zero
qualms approving the use of a
store-bought sauce, as per my
ﬁne example. But if you’re keen
to add an extra hit of ambition to
the undertaking, there are sev-
eral options available.

Pesto can be a fun addition to
any pizza —— it can even replace
the sauce. It freezes marvel-
ously, so if you’re going through

the trouble of preparing it in the ‘

first place, you might consider
doubling the recipe and saving

_a few servings.

‘Not unlike a pot roast or cas-
serole, pesto leaves room for
ﬂexibility in its preparation..Ev-
erything essentially gets tossed
into a food processor:~That’s the

one equipment caveat: to get the .
sauce mixture chopped ﬁnely

enough, you do have to invest in
an‘ appropriate appliance -— at-
tempting to mince the ingredi-
ents by hand with a knife is un-
likely to yield favorable results.

The fresh basil leaves, olive
oil and garlic cloves are a must

'— a ratio of 4 cups of basil, 1/2

cup of olive oil and two crushed
garlic cloves per batch — but the
inclusion and amount of pepper,

parsley, pine nuts or almonds and
Parmesan cheese is up to you.
My roommate has her own

all things remotely healthy, even

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Nwankwo achieves  

academically, athletically

Freshman only player on his team with full academic scholarship

Lauren Kirschman
Assistant Sports Editor

Freshman Aron Nwankwo has had
ambitious goals since he was _a little
kid. But unlike those of many college
basketball players, his didn’t revolve

 primarily around a ball and an arena

L

\

full of fans.

The 18-year-old started playing bas-
ketball when he was young and began
thinking seriously about the sport in
high school. Yet it was the medical field
that always held his attention.

Now a walk-on with the No. 4 Pitt
men’s basketball team, Nwankwo bal-
ances the duties ofa Division I athlete
with the life of a pre-med student on a
full academic scholarship.

For Nwankwo, that means lessons -
Nintime management and plenty oflate

nights. The team practices almost two
hours a day, sometimes up to five days a
week, and must also travel to and from
games.

“When I need to get work done, I get
it done,” Nwankwo said simply.

It’s a basic strategy, and one that
Nwankwo tries to adhere to, but he does
occasionally surrender to a familiar foe
of college students.

“I procrastinate sometimes, and then

___I have to punish myself sometimes and

stay up late,” he said. “It’s tough. It’s
really tough.” ‘

Although Nwankwo has been inter-
ested in medicine since he was a kid, he
did not know exactly the path he wanted
to take when he entered college. Now,
‘however, he said he’s starting to lean
toward sports medicine. ‘

“Something in the sports field,” the
forward said. “I’m not sure if I’m going
to be a surgeon or just a regular physi-
cian. I’m still ﬁguring it out.”

Division I, Division II and Division
III teams such as Johns Hopkins, Penn
State, Elon and NJIT recruited him to
play basketball, but Nwankwo said he

didn’t pursue those options because he '

was so attracted to Pitt’s combination
of academics and athletics.

“One of the main reasons was their
pre-med program and stuff like that,”
said Nwankwo, who grew up in Bal-
timore, said. “Then I got to join the

basketball team, and it wasn’t too far
from home.” _ '
While the vast majority of his team-
mates are at Pitt on full athletic schol-
arships, Nwankwo is the only member
of his team going to school on a full
academic scholarship. _
The need to excel is cementedin
Nwankwo’s personality. It’s something
he said partially stems from his par-

ents, but mostly just defines him as a

person.

“Everything I do —- education, sports
or whatever — I want to'be the best,”
he said.

That muchwas evident in high school.
The Pitt basketball player not only grad-
uated with a 4.0 GPA, but helped guide
Baltimore City College High School,
ranked No. 1 in the state, to consecu-
tive Class 2A_state titles and was named
the Baltimore Basketball Academyis
2010 Scholar-Athlete’. Nwankwo said
he couldn’t have imaginedleaving bas-
ketball behind after he graduated.

“I had a lot of success in high school,” i

he said. “I couldn’t really see myself
stop playingonce I left  so I wanted
to play, wherever I was at.”

Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon, didn’t
know much about Nwankwo, as walk-
ons have to contact coaches instead
of the other wayaround. But after
Nwankwo played in the Pitt Jam Fest
AAU tournament — anevent held for
elite high school basketball players each
spring — at the Petersen Events Center
in April of 2010, Dixon offered him a
position on the team.

.“He’s a great kid, and it’s‘not often,

that you have guys that you don’t know
a lot about when they come here,” Dixon

said. “So it’s just great for him to have

the impact that he has had.”

As a walk-on, Nwankwo said his role
with the Panthers is to work hard and
help the team improve. He tries to pro-
vide emotional support and when he
gets the chance to be on the court, he
plays hard.

Although he doesn’t appear in many
games, he provides an athletic presence
with his 6—foot-7, 200-pound frame,
playing hard in practice against his
teammates to help make them better.

Nwankwo played a total of 13 minutes
this season in eight games. He put up his

first collegiate point with a free throw

on Dec. 12 against Delaware.

- His performance doesn’t go unno-
ticed by Dixon, who preaches that’ all
15 members of the team are important
and need to improve each day.

“He just goes about it and works
hard,” Dixon said. “We don’t separate
a walk-on from a scholarship guy. They
get all the same things, and we treat
them all the same and have the same
expectations for them.” ,

Dixon said the coaches are focused
on helping Nwankwo improve in all fac-

ets of his life.

“Obviously, his goal is to go to medi-
cal school, but at the same time we’re
trying to help him become as good a
player as he can be and as good a student
as he can be and reach those goals that
he has in mind,”.the.coa.ch said.

And though Nwankwo’s college ca-
reer can be hard to balance, he embraces
the difficulties.

“It’s challenging. me, definitely. I
like the challenge. It’ll help me in the
future,” he said. I

TONY’S TOP 10

NCAA Tourney

should change

Tonyjovenitti
Senior Staﬁ" Writer

 

Right after Duke bored the nation last
year by winning the NCAA Tournament
(again), basketball fans immediately
turned their attention to the latest Tour-
nament expansion news. There were ru-
mors that the NCAA would add another
round and possibly invite as many as 128
teams to the Dance.

Luckily, the Tournament was only

expanded from 65’ to 68 teams, which
will make for odd—looking brackets and
more speculation over bubble teams. But
why stop there?

This week, I bring you the top 10
changes the NCAA Tournament should
make.

 a Big East Champion gets a
bye. Let’s face it. The‘Big East is awe-
some. It’s almost as good in basketball
as it is bad in football —-— almost. Sports
writerjason King recently wrote on Ya-
hoo! Sports that the Big East might be
too tough, which is why no Big East team
has won the National Championship in
the past six years, even though it was
the best conference each of those years.
The solution? The best team in the best
conference should getjia bye,.which leads
me to my next point. ' V’ S

9 o Give the Big East its own re-
gional. Last week, Pitt Newscolumnist
Greg Trietley outlined why all 16 Big
East teams should make the Tourna-
ment. Give the Big East the entire East
regional, and then let the other, lesser
conferences play in the other three
brackets..What’s that? How could the

champion get a bye if all 16 teams make A

it? Uh, well 

8 a Stop going to Dayton, Ohio.
No offense to Dayton, but'Dayton sucks.
There is not much there, yet the NCAA
Tournament holds its play—in game there
every year. This year, the “city” gets to
host thenew First Four round, where the
final four teams selected to the Tourna-
ment compete. Why relegate something
new and exciting to the sixth—1argest
city»in Ohio, "home to an arena that fits

at football stadiums. I get that the
NCAA’likes to play Final Four games
at giant stadiums so it can increase its‘
ridiculous profits,eve_n more by selling
more tickets (but don’t let the players

touch any ofthat money — gasp!). But v

playing Sweet 16 and Elite Eight rounds
at places like the Louisianassuperdome
is just a terrible idea. The stadium is

In all honesty, that’s probably the only
way it’s going to happen. Until they do
this though  Go 15-seeds, go‘!

35 Actually end it in March. The
Tournament has many nicknames, but
the best is by far “March Madness” —- if
not for the simple fact thattrl love allit-
eration. But the Tournament actually
ends in April. Thatfs false advertise-
ment, my friends. Why not start the
college basketball season a week early
and end March Madness in March?

last two areactually serious. The Tour- _

nament rarely visits Madison Square
Garden in New York any more. I under-
stand that the Big East holds it hostage
for a week before the tournament with
its own conference tournament, and

But When March rolls around, only
about 50-100 tickets are allotted 

usually less than half full, and thesight
lines are terrible. -

5 o Keep ignoring the West Coast.

“ West Coast fansand PAC-10 (or PAC—12

or whatever the heck it’s called now)
fans like to claim that the NCAA and '

four of this week’s Top 25 are Western
schools. But the PAC-10 certainly isn’t/

I doing anything to improve its status. as

the weakest conference.,Of theeight

~ regional rounds, only two are out West.

I say keep it that way until the PAC-10 '

regularly. _ '

4 o The 16—seed gets a home game.
How can you not feel bad for the lowly _

have to face the overall No. 1 seed. I say
pick a random 16—seed —— preferably one
that wins a play~in game — you know, as
a reward for beating a crappy team -
and give it a home game against the.No. -
1 seed.Maybe,just maybe, we’ll finally
see a No. 1 seed fall in the first round.

1 0 More student tickets. Most stu-
dents get to go to regular-season“home
games of their team for free or ridicu-

when March rolls around, only about
50-100't'ick”ets are allotted to students,
not including seats for the‘ Final Four
since that’s at a giant stadium. What’s

the result? A boring crowd filled with ,

families_and rich alumni. One of the best
parts of college basketball is the intense
atmosphere of games. But in the first
four rounds of the sport’s biggest event,
that aspect is absent. The simple solu-
tion is to give more tickets to students,
since, you know, they are the ones-.pay-
