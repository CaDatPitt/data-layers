SGB demands more power from administration

By Jenifer Crook
Asst. News Editor

Because of the current structure
of the Student Government Board,
members claim they do not have
the power to either represent Pitt
undergraduates adequately or
accomplish the goals they set at
the start of their tenure.

In a report sent to top Pitt
officials last week, SGB members
Patrick Abramowich and Bob
Batchelor openly criticized the
administration for ignoring the
advice of the board when making
decisions that affect Pitt
undergraduates.

“We want the administration to
listen to us, to understand that we
speak for the Pitt undergraduates
and take our concerns to heart,”
said Batchelor. “We just want
basic rights, which we don’t have.
We want the administration to
listen to us, take in what we have
to say, reﬂect on it and maybe act
on it.”

He continued, “But we don’t
get that, so we have to do

something that is perceived as
liberal and write this report."
The report reads, “In the area
of student input into
administrative decision making,
Pitt displays a disregard for the
interests and perspectives of the
students —- the lifeblood of the
university. In this light, the
Student Government Board fails
to receive recognition as the voice
of an active, concerned, and
mobilized student body.”
According to Batchelor,
Abramowich and fellow board
member Michael Cohen, some of
the board’s complaints include:
-Board members are not
consulted about decisions that
affect student life, and are given
the run—around when they try to
find out what happened. Cohen
cited the termination of the maid
service in Schenley Quadrangle
suites. “When we approached
[Asst. Director of Housing] Bob
Robinson and Donovan Hughes
[director of housing] about the
issue, we played administrative
pingpong. Hughes sends me to

PPC AIDS

By Katie Malaspina
Staff Writer

University of Pittsburgh students were recently given the opportu nity
to contribute their insights and support to all of those afflicted with
AIDS.
"Someday humanity will accept everyone, even your most

courageous souls. Peace, love and deepest respect.”
‘May we try to understand what we have through all we ’ve lost."
“God is not always fair. "

These are just a few of the messages written on the Pitt Program
Council’s AIDS Memorial Quilt, displayed in the William Pitt Union
art gallery from April 2 through 7.

Nicole Vitale, arts director for the PPC, designed the 3-by-6 foot,
gold cotton quilt. The saying on the quilt reads, “To those who have
fallen from the tree of life and for those who are still holding on 
“ A variety of colored leaves are drawn on the quilt with the PPC logo
at the lower right corner.

Vitale said,” [People] can just sign their name or write a message
to someone they know that had AIDS or just in general...”

“A lot of people didn’t know if they could [sign the quilt]. I wish
more could come,” said Kitty Reh, a WPU art-gallery worker.

Last year’s PPC art director Martha Moranz programmed “Before
Forever,” a live dance performance by Danceteller about people
living with AIDS. Also, a quilt done by Swarthmore College was sent
to Pitt from the Philadelphia branch of the NAMES project. This
exhibit opened March 15 in the WPU art gallery.

Vitale said that after seeing the Swarthmore College panel, “we all
decided we should do a panel from Pitt.”

The PPC quilt, donated on behalf of the University of Pittsburgh,
will be sent to the NAMES Project in San Francisco, where the square
will be sewn to the main quilt, said Vitale. “Usually a quilt is donated
for an individual, but this is a memorial to everyone living and dead
with AIDS,” she said.

The NAMES Project, founded by Cleve Jones in the Castro district
of San Francisco in 1987, began as a response from lesbians and gay
men and friends as a memorial to all the people affected by the AIDS
epidemic.

The NAMES Project takes donations from communities where the
Quilt is displayed and uses the funds to support people living with
AIDS

The Quilt, made up of more than 11,000 individual memorial
panels, tours the country in sections because it is too large to display
in one place.

“Last time it was displayed [in one piece] was in [Washington] D.(
last year,” said Vitale.

Robinson, back and forth.”

-The administration controls
the agenda at the Student Affairs
Advisory Council, even though
the meetings are supposed to be
for the benefit of student groups.
“We give them items to put on
the agenda, but they select which
will get addressed; and then [Pitt
President Wesley] Posvar brings
in his experts to combat whatever
we have on the agenda; in other
words to blast whatever we say,”
Batchelor said.

0 Though three board members
do hold seats on the senate
council, they claim their input is
limited. “They bring us in there
and give us three minutes to
speak,” said Batchelor. “They
don’t really care about what we
have to say; at least the upper
level of administration doesn’t
care.”

0 When board members do get
the opportunity lo speak, their
questions are rarely answered
directly. Batchelor said that when
he asked Posvar about a tuition

Board says adviser
overstepped bounds

By Lou Grieco
Senior Staff Writer

Even though the Student
Government Board president,
the Allocations Committee
Chairman and all but one
member of the SGB feel that
she overstepped her bounds
as an adviser, Joyce Giangarlo
denies that this is the case.

It was discovered recently
by 7bePz'ttNews that Giangarlo,
associate director of student
activities and the SGB adviser,
deposited $15,000 of student
money into the SGB reserve
fundwithoutdiscussingitwith
any student— government
officials until the transaction
was finished. The money was
a payment from 779ePittNews,
which owed the sum to the

SGB. This stemmed from an
agreement made in 1986 when
the newspaper first planned
on becoming independent of
the student government.

“I would have to say that
she did overstep her bounds
as an adviser,” said Allocations
Committee Chairman Gil
Borok, who first found out
about the deposit when he
discovered it on a printout.

“The fact that Joyce did this
means she didn’t follow the
manual for the committee she's
an adviser for,” said board
member Mike Cohen. “We
weren’t told about it, and it’s
in the manual that we should
be told about it.”

PIT!‘ NEWS, Monday, April 9, 199.0

By Andrea Barczykowski
Staff Writer

Imagine that you are hanging
from a pole 3,500 feet above the
ground, the weather is a mere 15
degrees, and the 80 miles-per-
hour wind is whipping right
through you. Your hands let go,
and you realize that you are
plummeting to the earth. Then,
just when you are sure that a
painful death is only 25 seconds
away, you feel the slight tug on
your body which tells you that
your parachute has been
deployed, and you’re going to
live.

For the 10 members of the Pitt
Outdoors Club and myself, no
imagination is necessary. This is
what we experienced when we
all made our first parachute jump
at Canton Air Sports in Canton,
Ohio, this weekend.

Before our jump we took part
in a comprehensive training
session for about five hours. Our
jump instructor, Scott, who has
made 695 jumps, told" us,

Jason Hillrnan/' f he Pitt News

Member of Pitt's Outdoors Club prepare for a jump.

“[Skydiving’s] the best thing I ever
experienced, and I hope it will be
the same for you.”

We began our class by studying
a picture of an aerial view of the
airport; the area where we were
supposed to land. The
surrounding danger areas were
pointed out: a large body of water,
clusters of trees, houses and
random telephone wires. We
were instructed to avoid these
areas.

After that, we learned how to
exit the plane, which is done
when the jump master yells
“position.” We practiced crawling
out of a fake plane and hanging
from an attached bar. It was
stressed then that the most
important thing is to arch your
body for a stable jump. Then,
you count to six and check your
canopy for the numerous things
that can go wrong: line twists,
spinning, spinning with line
twists, end-eell closure, pilot-
chute hesitation and, my favorite,
total failure of the main chute.

Of course we were instructed

A Outdoors Club jumps into danger

on recognizing and correcting all
of the possible malfunctions.
Some of which can be corrected
and others which mean cutting
out of your main chute and
releasing your reserve canopy.
But I couldn’t keep from forgetting
that the ground approaches very
quickly. Perhaps this explains
why we had to sign a release
saying that no matter how we
died, why we died, or whose
fault our death was, we couldn’t
sue anyone for anything.

We then learned how to land,
or actually, how to fall, which
told me that the landing would
be less than soft.

Again, we learned about what
could go wrong. Because as Scott
told us again and again, “Anything
that can go wrong, will go wrong.”
The “wrong” in this case included
landing on water, rooftops, wires

and trees, and also landing on .

“scurried around the question for
at least 10 minutes. I almost got
up and walked out; it was just
embarrassing for me to sit there
and listen to this jibberish from
the president of the university.”

-If the SGB does attempt to
make changes, its efforts are not
appreciated. According to
Abramowich, the board recently
gave $1,250 from the reserve fund

to the intramurals and recreation A

department for architect’s fees to
research the expansion of the
Trees Hall weight room. After
five weeks, “I had to call and
verify the transfer,” he said. “They
never called and said ‘Thank you,
we got the money.’ They’re
supposed to be getting back to us
so we» can have some input as
potential funders of the projects.”
Abramowich added that when
he contacted a facilities-
management official, the
department was not even aware
that the ‘SGB was funding the

project.

According to ‘Abramowich,
these types of problems are what
have sometimes driven past SGB

the second term, SGB members
just get disgusted and loaf around
up here.”

Abramowich and Batchelor’s
report came as a result of a Texas
conference the two attended in
February, called the 12th
Intercollegiate Conference of the
American Association of
University Students.

“The more we talked with
people from other student
governments around the country,
the more we * realized how
inadequate our ability is to
accomplish the goals of student
government,” said Abramowich.

Backed by the entire SGB, the
report calls for the administration
to formalize the board’s power,
possibly through the
development of a senatorial body,
which would replace the current
SGB format. Although they have
not devised any specifics for the
body, Abramowich and Batchelor
proposed that in addition to SG B,
the group would include
representatives from each
student-governance group. The
organizations recognized as
governance groups are the Black
Action Society, Nursing Student
Association, academy of Students
of Pharmacy, Engineering Student
Cabinet, Inter—Fraternity Council
and Panhellenic Association.

“With the senatorial body, we
could take a consolidated voice
to the administration. If there’s a
problem on campus, we can take
a senatorial vote on it, pass a

resolution and say we have a
majority of the undergraduates at
this university supporting the
legislation,” said Batchelor. “That
definitely increases our power.”

Abramowich views the
senatorial body as a means to
better representation for Pitt’s
diverse undergraduate
population.

“Another [component] of the
senatorial body would be quotas
of certain minorities on campus.
For example, at least one black
would have to be on, one Oriental,
one gay, etc.” he said.

Cohen said that if formed, the
senatorial body would force
administrators to seek student
advice.

“We want to be more informed.
By the administration coming to
us directly with problems, and
the senatorial body existing,
students will become informed
faster,” Cohen said.

However, some Pitt
administrators expressed
confusion and skepticism over
the proposed governance group.

“I sincerely hope [the SGB is]
not saying that they want
influence at the expense of all
other student organizations. I
don’t want to see one big player
replace 150 or 200 others that
have unique identities. For the
SGB to think that is extremely
naive and even arrogant,” Dennis.
Donham, interim vice—president
of Student Affairs, said. Donham
said he thought other governance

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Monday, April 9, 1990

groups would not support the
formation of a senatorial body.

“Students will say, ‘We want
[SGB] to have some power to
represent us, but we don’t want
[SGB] to have all of it,” said
Donham.

Associate director of Student
Activities Joyce Giangarlo, who
serves as SGB adviser, said that
she can’t understand the board’s
complaints, since Pitt’s current
SGB system is the most effective
she has seen.

“[The SGB] works so well
because it is clearly defined, and
things can get done,” she said.
Giangarlo added that if the
senatorial body was initiated, the
current SGB effectiveness might
be lost because the bureaucracy
would become too large.

In addition, Giangarlo said that
the board actually has much more
power thanit realizes.

“SGB has the strongest level of
access to administrators and
faculty than anyone else here,”
she said. “Somehow or other that
has not been felt strongly enough
by the [board members].”

However, the board members
disagree. “Whatever we do, even
if an administrator wants to help
us, it takes a month and a half to
get into his office,” Batchelor
said.

Associate Provost Jack Daniel
agreed with Giangarlo that the
SGB has as much power as it
needs; it just isn’t utilizing that
power properly. Daniel said that

 

the university provides seats for
students on several university
councils, including the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences and College of
Arts and Sciences.

“On the most important
councils, we firmly require
student involvement," Daniel said,
“so I get frustrated when students
say they aren’t considered, when
actually they are.”

Daniel continued, “The

university is obliged to encourage V

student involvement, but that
doesn’t mean we have to do or
say anything a student wants any
more than we do a. faculty
member.”

In hopes of resolving some of
the problems brought out by the
report, on Friday afternoon board
members met with five
administrators —— Executive Vice-
President Jack Freeman,
Executive Assistant to the Vice
President of Student Affairs Gary
Houston, director of Student
Activities Joe Cavalla, Donham
and Giangarlo. _ Both
administrators and SGB members
seemed to agree that the meeting
was productive in opening the
lines of communication‘ between
the two.

Although he would not discuss
the specifics of the meeting,
Freeman said, “I think the report
makes some very useful
comments about the role of
student government. I think
there’s a lot of frustration in

gone too far, SGB Presidentjulie
Shepard said that “perhaps as an

adviser” [she had, but] “I see this
as being overstepped in our best
interests. I’m not completely sure
why she put it in the reserve fund
on her own.”

Shepard noted that when
Giangarlo told her that the money
had been transferred to the
reserve fund, “the tone was ‘Is
that OK?”’ However, she also said
that the SGB “should have been
consulted.”

When asked if her actions were
out of line, Giangarlo said, “No,
[the money] needed a place to go
until [SGB members] decided
what they wanted to do with it.
Someone had to take
responsibility for it.

“IThe reserve fund] is simply a
holding spot. There’s not that
many [accounts] to put it in. If

somebody wants it somewhere
else, they just have to say, ‘Let’s
put it somewhere else.’’’

Interim Vice President for
Student Affairs Dennis Donham
said that he did not know about
the deposit but added,”YOu’re
asking the wrong person, but I
want to know the answer myself.
I don’t have an answer to that.

“I don’t want to think that
there’s some kind of ill—wOrk
here. [Giangarlo] had better have
a good explanation. My guess is
she does.”

However, when asked if
Giangarlo had been wrong in
not consulting the SGB, he said,
“If that’s their perception, and
that’s what happened, pure and
simple, I’d have to say yes. But
my guess is that’s not exactly all

that happened. At the very least,
it’s a misunderstanding.”
“Regardless of the merit of the
decision, she still circumvented
allocation policy,” said board
member Pat Abramowich. “I
would say she was guilty of a
breech of procedure. I feel that
we should have been consulted
before the decision on our behalf.”
Abramowich and fellow board
member Bob Batchelor, co-
authors of the Report on the
Comparative Status of the Student
Government Board, sent the
report out to members of the
administration last week. In the
report, they wrote, “Both the
university administration as well
as student organizations can and
in fact do choose to ignore the
sovereignty of the Student

Government Board with
absolutely no detrimental effects. ”

Nearly all of the members of
the board, including Batchelor
and Abramowich, and the
allocations chairman said that
Giangarlo’s actions were an
example Of this.

“I think this is definitely an
example,” Batchelor said. “It is a
very good example of the
administration Ioversteppingl
boundaries by not telling students
about student concerns.”

“Yes, it’s a primary example,”
said board member Don Rhodes.
“The decisions are made, and
they are given to us after the fact.
It does come back to us when the
students ask why the money was
put in, and we look bad when we
don’t have an answer.”

“Many of the issues that we deal
with are very complicated; they
require a lot of time and effort on

Cavalla stressed the need for
the SGB to work on issues as a

group.

have more weight than

Administrators from the Office of

weekly with the board, and
monthly sessions with Freeman
to discuss campus issues were

“We talked a lot about the

Board President Julie Shepard.

to do in these situations.

By this time I was ready to go
home. I begged —l pleaded, for
a ride. But no one else wanted to
leave. They actually wanted to
hurl themselves from a plane
two—thirds of a mile up in the air.

Realizing what Could happen
when I told my editor I didn’t
have the story, I decided to at
least finish class.

For the rest of class we practiced
and reviewed. We went over our
exiting and arching, and what to
do if any of the infamous “wrong”
things happened, over and over
again. At the end of the session,
we took a written test and
completely went over all of the
questions. Even though I aced
the test, I still had doubts about
surviving. But our instructor told
us very seriously, “If I didn’t think
you could do it, you wouldn’t
have come this far.”

Now we were supposed to be
ready to jump. Eric Ring, the
president of the Outdoors Club,
expressed some nervousness.

“I thought the training was
complete, but the biggest factor
is my self confidence.”

Until this point the jump-plane
pilot had been telling us that the

I wind was too strong, and that we
might not be able to jump. Good,
I thought, my editor couldn't
blame me for that. But when our
instruction was over, the wind
had conveniently calmed down,
and the first group of three was
told to get geared up; a very
brave first three.

The first one to jump, Glenn
Harshman, didn’t begin to worry
until right before he had to get on
the plane.

“I wasn’t really nervous, until
they actually came in and said the
winds were all right,” he said.

Leonard Hill, who was jumping

with him, was relatively calm.
“But I’m sure I’ll get really nervous
when I take that first step out,” he
said.

These courageous men got on
the plane, and they were off.
Everyone on the ground was
nervous, and when we saw that
first parachute open, we yelled
and cheered. He did it; everything
was fme.’T he jumps continued,
everyone encouraged each other
and were so proud every time
someone jumped.

When the first jumpers came_ V
back, everyone wanted to know,»

what it was like.

“I had the hardest time letting
go, butafter that it was cool,” Hill
said. A

“I saw the static line [that opens
the chute] and all I could think
was that it wasn’t connected. After
I jumped and felt it pull, it was

 

like Yeah!” said Harshman.

Everyone seemed to forget what
we were instructed to do as soon
as they jumped.

“I gasped for half a second, and
said, ‘wait, I'm supposed to be
counting,”’ said jumper Chris
Cook.

Apparently, everybody was
coming back unharmed. Our lines
were pulled automatically, and
ground control told us exactly
what to do. Yet, I was still a
basket case.

While I was getting ready, one
jumper,’Wh0 I later found out
was Ring, went into a spin, which
he successfully got out of.

“I just listened to what [ground
control] told me, and it was fine,”
he said.

Right before I was to get on the
plane, a fellow basket case,
Valerie Wallbillich, was returning
from her jump.

“I hit my face on the side of the
plane, but don’t worry, it was

_, great,” she said.

OK, I wasn’t worried. I wasn’t

really about to be sick, and that
wasn’t really me who had the
plane go around twice, before I
could force myself to step out
into the violent winds, above the
tiny, tiny little houses.

But I did it. I let go of the bar,
closed my eyes —— and completely
forgot everything I was told.

It wasn’t until I was sure I had
felt the tug of my chute opening
that I opened my eyes. It was so
incredible. I was ﬂoating through
the atmosphere, looking from
the sky to the ground, instead of
the other way around. I made
turns and checked out the scenery
for about four minutes. Ground
control prepared me to land, and
although I completely collapsed,
no pain was involved.

After I got up I realized what I
just did. I jumped from an
airplane, while it was in the air.
My knees went weak, and I had
to lean on the man who was
getting my chute, to keep from
falling. All of a sudden, I started
to giggle and my body was

shaking. I noticed I was making
a fool of myself, but I've done
that before, and this time I couldn't
control it.

The workers all let me know
that it was OK to look stupid, and
they were happy and proud that
I made the jump.

“We have a policy here; none
of us forget our first jump, so we
know what you’re feeling,” said
one of the instructors.

Senior Andy Packel of the
Outdoors Club has waited a long
time for this feeling. It was his
idea for the club to do the jump.

“I’ve wanted to go since
freshman year, and I wanted to
do it before I graduated, and the
club expressed interest in it,” he
said.

The Pitt Outdoors Club, with
between 40 and 50 members,
provides many novices with such
experiences. According to Ring,
“The group is geared towards
teaching beginners, with only two
or three advanced groups going
out," he said.

Pitt News reporter Andrea Barczykowski practies pulling her reserve -ute.

  Some soz/ma’ SGB proposals

In past years, members of Pitt Student Government
Boards have become notorious for their inability to
accomplish anything tangible while in office.

Members have often blamed this unproductiveness on
the lack of respect and cooperation they receive from
members of the administration that they must work with
if they hope to see their projects through to completion.

Because their terms are only one year, members have
also claimed that by the time administrators return their
numerous phone calls, their tenure is over. Thus, a new
board would take over, and the old projects would be lost
in the shuffle, uncompleted.

This year's board seems to be a different breed,

however. Current members are not content to sit back and, I

watch their projects die somewhere in the administrativef
channels. In fact, two board, members, Patrick Abra-‘
mowich and Bob Batchelor, have made an unprece-
dented move by writing and publicly releasing a report
which blatantly criticizes the administration.

Alleging that the administration ignores student opinion
when making important decisions that affect student
lives, such as tuition increases and the cancellation of
suite-maid service, Abramowich and Batchelor, with the
backing of the entire board, are asking that the SGB be
granted more power so that it is fully recognized as the

‘ official voice of Pitt undergraduates.

This report has evoked strong response from Pitt
administrators who after meeting with board members
Friday, agreed to hold weekly sessions with the SGB to
keep the group informed on current issues and consider
the board’s opinions in decisions. If these measures do
prove to be more than just empty promises, Pitt may be
well on the way to bringing students and administrators
closer to a common ground.

Considering how inactive many past boards have been,
the administration can hardly be blamed for not seeking
out its viewpoints. On the other hand, the university
would be foolish not to take advantage of the energy and
dedication shown by the current board.

Abramowich and Batchelor are to be commended for
their boldness in bringing SGB administrative problems
to the forefront. Hopefully, their actions will set a
precedent and raise the standard for future Student
Government Boards.

campus wisdom.

Conservatives often oppose
new causes that the environ-
mental movement (chieﬂy envi-
ronmental freaks, not accredited
environmentalists) jumps on. This
is principally due to the fact that
the causes which the groups
advocate seem not only to be
baseless but also contradictory in
their intentions.

Consumer “advocate” Ralph

‘Nader urges Americans to Cut

their Exxon cards in half in order
to show national solidarity against

the Exxon Valdez oil spill. How— _

ever, Nader has also protested
the use of nuclear power. (It's
estimated that the cost of pro-
longing the operation of New
Hampshire's Seabrook nuclear
power plant is $6.45 billion.)
Without the beneﬁts of nuclear
power, Americans are forced to
rely on that same Exxon oil‘(that
saturates the coastline of Alaska)
which is produced by the oil
company that Nader seeks to
punish. Not to mention that such
actions force thousands of blue-
collar workers employed by
Exxon to join the unemployment
lines. Thus, Nader's actions not
only hurt the U.S. economy but
also business and workers.
Another example of environ-
mental belligerence is the move-
ment to halt the destruction of
the tropical rain forests. This
deforestation movement is con-
cerned about the greenhouse
effect. The greenhouse effect is
based on the premise that trees
absorb carbon dioxide and
through the ‘process of photosyn-
thesis, recycle it into the atmos-
phere as oxygen. But without the
trees to absorb the carbon diox-
ide, the carbon dioxide lingers in
the air as a gas that traps energy
(i.e. heat) thus causing a global-
warming effect. Thus the envi-
ronmental movement is trying to
stop deforestation in order to
thwart global warming. However,
it fails to acknowledge the fact
that 70 percent of the unabsorbed
carbon—dioxide gas that would
cause a global-warming crisis is
absorbed by underwater plant
life —— photosynthetic material
that will not be chopped down.
Conclusion? As long as there is

water, we are not going to suffo-
cate. Furthermore, statistics prove
that the average temperature of
the Earth .for the past century is
only one degree higher than the
last. The environmental move-
ment would be better off arguing
not that deforestation causes

    

Pl
Kengor

global warming, but rather that it
destroys rare plant and animal
life that borderlines extinction.
Another one of the environ-
mental movement’s concerns is
the hole in the ozone layer, which
is widening because of chlo-
roﬂuorocarbons which are found

in aerosol cans, among other '

items. This is a valid concern.
However, as long as we cease to
use or cut back on chloroﬂuoro-
carbons, the hole in the ozone
layer will eventually close. For
billions of years, the Earth has
been faced with ecological disas-
ters and still managed to exist.
Ecological disasters occur natu-
rally, and the Earth adapts.
(Compare Pittsburgh's air today
to that of 30 years ago; it survived
the steel mills.)

Such examples as the afore-

mentioned leave conservatives
no alternative but to laugh at, shy
away from and not take seriously
any new movement by the envi-
ronmental crowd.

Actor Ted Danson is proving
himself about as intelligent and
insightful as his character on the
television program “Cheers” in
blaming Reagan administration
spending policies for environ-
mental problems. Yet, among
spending increases in other envi-
ronmental programs under Re-
agan, real spending for pollution

abatement and control increased
(from $68.9 billion in 1984 to
$77.8 billion in 1986, for example).

The environmental movement

seems to have a natural tendency
to blame environmental prob-
lems on Republican administra-
tions. However, it was President
Nixon who created the Environ-
mental Protection Agency. Also,
after only three months in office,
President Bush introduced a
broad clean-air package which
still awaits House approval.

Such a lack of knowledge or

disregard thereof seems to feed
the environmental movement
They do damage to their cause
through embarrassing and often
radical protests. They seem to
have an innate inclination to
protest or jump on a bandwagon
before knowing all the facts
(which would often prove their
efforts famous and futile from the
very beginning). Perhaps these
people have an infatuation to
protest and scream aloud in front
of a television camera. Maybe
they have a dreamy vision that
their actions are reminiscent of a
rebellious character in an Oliver
Stone movie, that they’re serving
as the last, lost bit of hope or en-
vironmental conscience trying to
snatch any remaining innocence
from the inexorable jaws of
greedy corporate and industrial-
ist American capitalism, or maybe
they just have a desire to keep the
revolution alive. Then again,
perhaps it’s just a sheer display of
ignorance in regard to the envi-
ronment: the type that makes
conservatives cringe every time
they hear of a new No Nukes!
rock concert.

Whatever the environmental
movement’s cause, it often ends
up being more anti-business than
proenvironment, whether unnec-
essarily or unknowingly so. This
is precisely why conservatives
have shunned the environmental
movement.

The 1990s and 21st century will
bring a host of new environ-
mental “concerns.” It is the duty
and ecological and moral obliga-
tion of conservatives to decipher
what is, and what is not, in real-
ity, a "concern."

An experienced resident reflects on Life in the dorms

When I graduate from this
university in a few weeks, there
will be many things I'll miss.
Waiting one hour for cold food
in the cafeteria, two hours for a
washer in the laundromat and
‘three hours in line for registra-
tion are just some examples. But
more than anything else, I'll miss
living in a dorm.

There is something to be said
about living in a pie-shaped room
for two years on a floor with 30
other guys. Since moving into
Tower C my junior year, my
musical tastes have certainly
widened. To one side of my
room is Tony, who listens to
every heavy-metal band to have
ever been questioned by Tipper
Gore. Heavy metal doesn’t bother
me, but hearing the song “Devil-
Child from the Nether World,
Make Love to Me” at 3 a.m. is a bit
too much. Contrast that with the

Pitt students should not re-
main silent in the face of the City
of Pittsburgh's attempt to revoke
the tax exemptions to which the
university and other non-profit
organizations are entitled.

There is no question that if the
city wins its battle to squeeze
Pittsburgh's universities and
hospitals for _more tax dollars,
Pitt's tuition will take another
jump. But there are other rea-

..«_ sons to take up the issue with»
Mayor Sophie Masloff on this

score.

The spiraling prices of
healthcare, followed by increases
in college tuition are among the
greatest concerns of Americans.
Costs in both areas have increased .
much faster than inﬂation in
recent years.

' Pittsburgh's hospitals and uni-
versities then are precisely the
institutions we need to
strengthen, not undermine. To
force these non-profit institutions
to raise fees through unjust taxa-
tion would chase customers and
students still further elsewhere

Dorm residents are allowed :-

But the one thing we can’t do is
bring in ice-cream cones from
the cafeteria. The desk atten-
dants even have the little “ice-
cream cone busters” placard
posted on their booth windows.
This strikes me as very peculiar.

In seeking more taxes from the
very institutions that have made
this city one of the most livable,
the city is truly trying to devour
the goose that lays the golden
egg.

Note that I write “to seek more
taxes.” Few people realizehow
much tax income non—profits
already provide to the city. For
example, Pitt alone pays $410,000
a year in real-estate taxes,

' $430,000 in parking taxes and

$320,000 in amusement taxes and

voluntarily contributes an addi- .

tional $85,000 fee for municipal
services.

So the issue is not whether Pitt
and other non-proﬁts deserve a
totally free ride. Nor is it whether
President Wesley Posvar’s home
is not used enough for business
purposes, as the city has charged.

Nor should the issue be whether
the city needs more revenue.

see all the garbage that Zelda's

Sending praise for University External Studies Program

Greetings from an invisible
student. Isay invisible because in
the four years I have attended
Pitt, I have set foot on campus
only once. I have wished many
times that it might be otherwise.
I would have loved campus life
and classroom discussions.
However, I am very glad that
[University External Studies Pro-
gram] exists. Without its exis-
tence, the help of UESP and Book
Center staffs, the sympathy of
numerous profs, and the persua-
sion of Carolyn Loether (formerly
with UESP), my education would
have been more difficult.

I began my education at Pitt in
January of 1986 after gaining a
two-year degree at a local com-
munity college. Sophomore status
was achieved through the dele-
tion of a few nonqualifying cred-
its from my educational balance
sheet. From that point I went on
tolthe typical highs and lows of
student life  from a few thou-

sand miles away. My work and
family life endured similar cycles.
The joy of working after late
nights of study became a regular
pattern. My wife longed for the
end of all this joy. She called it the
end of four years of labor pains.

Last Saturday the end came.
On April 28, I get to stand with
my fellow graduates and receive
my diploma. I will receive a
Bachelor of Arts [degree] in eco-
nomics, magna cum laude (un-
less I blew my last exam). Thank
you, University of Pittsburgh, for
daring to be on the cutting edge
of alternative studies. Thank you,
Phi Chi Theta, for asking me to
join your organization. (I only
wish I could have). Thank you,
Alpha Sigma Lambda, for your
invitation as well. (Golden Key
National Honor Society, Pitts-
burgh chapter, did enroll me.)
And finally, I reserve my biggest
thanks to all the citizens and
students of the city of Pittsburgh

in the great state of Pennsylvania.
I am honored to be a graduate of
the University of Pittsburgh.

Legalizing drugs a bad idea

loam writing in response to
Daniel Alman’s article “Legaliza-
tion only solution in War on
Drugs ...” Mr. Alman suggests
that the legalization of drugs will
immediately stop all crimes asso-
ciated with the use of drugs. To
believe this concept is very naive
because it only takes into consid-
eration stereotypical views of drug
addicts and drug users. People
do not become addicted to drugs
by choice. It is a process that,
once started, is almost impos-
sible to reverse. An addict will do
anything to get his next fix as

quickly as possible. This means
turning to crime, not because he
does not make enough money at
work, but because he is so in-
volved with his drug habit he
does not work. This is but one
problem associated with the use
of drugs.

Another of these problems is
the use of drugs by minors. The
use of these substances has many
difficulties associated with it.
Among these are problems asso-
ciating [with] their parents and
peers, difficulty excelling in
school and physical-development
problems. Even legalizing drugs
for just adults is not going to
remove the inﬂuence of these
substances from our schools. I
know of many people who were
alcoholics in high school, and I
was smoking cigarettes before I
was of legal age to buy them.
Legalizing drugs will most likely
increase the availability of them
to rninors.[...l

Also asserted by Mr. Alman is
that “in a free society, a person
should be allowed to put what-
ever he or she wants into his or
her body," but this ignores the
fact that drug use can also in-
fringe on the rights of other
people. There are many cases
where people under the inﬂu-
ence of drugs other than alcohol
have caused accidents and deaths
of innocent bystanders. An in-
stance of this has also affected
the students of Pitt, when last
year a train carrying hazardous
chemicals derailed in Bloomﬁeld,

causing the evacuation of thou- I

sands [in] the area. The engineer
driving the train failed a drug test
and admitted in court that he was
under the influence of cocaine
when he wrecked. Drugs do not
just affect the user [but] can also
infringe on the rights of others.
Nobody has the right to do this.

§Pz'tt Stadium surface to get new lz_'fe; dome improbable

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

Starting May 1, the Pitt track
team will be without a home, but
.that’s OK according to Coach
John Vasvary.

' The surface of the track will be
replaced this summer for the ﬁrst
time in 12 years. The synthetic
turf on the football ﬁeld will also
be changed for the ﬁrst time in
seven years.

» “We had to do it, we couldn’t
goon the ﬁeld one more year.
We had to have that replaced,"
said Edward Bozik, director of

'<+:-. ' '-:-:

\ ‘ ‘

athletics at Pitt. “The track was
getting dangerous as was the
football ﬁeld.”

Bozik said he also had to give
the contractors- enough time to
ﬁnish before Pitt’s first home
football game. Pitt opens here on
Sept. 1, against Ohio University.

“I can’t take the football game
somewhere else. Not easily
anyhow," said Bozik. “I don't
want to go out to Athens to play
Ohio University.”

The Pitt track team has four
meets scheduled for after May 1,
including the NCAA

championships. According to

Big East losing streak

By Ron Ledgard
Staff Writer

The Panthers’ losing problems
continued, as they extended their
Big East losing streak to 25" games
oyer the past two years.

They lost both ends of their

doubleheader yesterday with the
Boston College Eagles by scores
of 12-2 and 5-3. Pitt’s Big East
record is 0-8, and the team’s
overall record has fallen to 3-12.

The Panthers’ losses not only
occurred in the standings, but
also on the injured list. Outﬁelder

Bozik, the Pitt Invitational has
been cancelled. It is one of the
two home meets for the Panthers
and was scheduled for May 12.
They are still uncertain as to
where they will practice during
the construction. They are looking
into several area high schools. A
logical place would be Carnegie
Mellon University, but its track is
undergoing similar construction.

“We’re going to have to put up
with it for about a month and find
some place else to go,”-said
Vasvary. “But in the long run,
we’re going to have some nice

facilities to run on.”

The new surface will feature a
new drainage system. Water will
soak through the carpet and roll
off to the sides. “Theoretically it
takes up to five inches of rain an
hour. You can get more than ﬁve
inches of rain, but you have a lot
of problems.if you get that,” said
Bozik.

The surface will differ from the
permeable-asphalt base that

‘ Three Rivers Stadium received

last year. The one covering Three
Rivers is designed for flat surfaces,
as needed for baseball games.
According to Bozik, Pitt has no

MONDAY, APRIL 9, 1990

   

need for a ﬂat surface and is
saving about $500,000 in the
process.

The money saved on the
resurfacing is not nearly enough
to make the doming of Pitt
Stadium a near-future possibility.

“It’s technically feasible, we
learned that. We learned it's also
on the order of about $50 to $60
million. It’s a big chunk of money.
So unless we come up‘ with a
fairy godmother somewhere,
that's not in the immediate realm.
It’s certainly {something}. we
would like to entertain,” said
Bozik.

Seniors prove to be key to Panther swim team's success

By Adam Kamras
Staff Writer

The Pitt men's swimming and
diving team will probably find
itself ranked in the top 25 in the
country after completing a 10-1
season.

The team won the Big East
Championship for its eighth
consecutive year, with Mike
Kozlina winning the outstanding
swimmer.

The Panthers equaled last year’s
fourth-place finish at the Eastern
Seaboards but improved on their
times compared with last year’s
competition.

The seniors provided much of

V) the excitment and success of the

team.

One of the biggest highlights
of the season was the dramatic
victory against Penn State, when

the ﬁnal relay team, consisting of .

Mike andjoe Kozlina, Tim Adams
and Bill Folger, edged out the
Nittany Lions by a fraction of a

second. The win broke Penn '

State's two—year winning streak
against Pitt.

The season also marked the
end of the careers of senior co-
captains Mike Kozlina, Adams
and Folger, in addition to Matt
Weist.

Mike Kozlina, who will
graduate in June with a
psychology major, has put
together an impressive career at
Pitt. He was named the
Outstanding Swimmer at the Big
East Championships for the
second consecutive year. He
qualified for the NCAA
Championships the past three
years. He is a candidate in the

Outstanding Athlete category of ‘

the Panther Blue and Gold Award.

His 10th-place NCAA finish in
the 100-yard butterﬂy will make
him an Honorable Mention All-
American. He plans to take the
summer off and try out for the

9 1992 Olympics. In 1988, he missed

the team by six spots.

Folger, a freestyler, was happy
with his senior campaign. “It was
quite a season. We pulled together

as a unit and did what we set out
to do," he said.

He was a member of an All-
American relay team his junior
year, along with Adams and Mike
Kozlina, for ﬁnishing in the top
16 at the NCAAs. He missed this
year’s NCAA competition by six-
tenths of a second.

Folger, a business and political-
science major, plans to go to law
school after graduation.

“It was great to swim at Pitt. I
wish for more support -and
backing by the athletic

department,” said Folger, He
would like to see more credit
given to the team for its hard
work and success.

Adams, the third captain, called
this season a very successful one.
The freestyle swimmer is a
member of several record-setting
relay teams at Pitt. “Tim Adams
has just been a solid swimmer for
us all along,” said Bradshaw.

Adams is a business and
economics major and plans either
to go to law school or to getajob
following graduation. His

said Bradshaw.

Weist narrowly missed breaking
Pitt records in both the 100 and

so close to [record time], it was
unbelievable," said Bradshaw.
Bradshaw also credits Weist with
constantly improving every year.

and then go to business school.

“I’m working hard, and I know

Seton Hall Coach PJ. Carlesimo

that is anybody’s business”.

In addition, Jermaine Morgan
of Jeannette (nine points, six
rebounds), the only player from
western Pennsylvania, has listed
Pitt as one of his ﬁnal choices.
Antonio Lang (13 points) of

Continued from page 10

The Panthers’ hitting ﬁnally
came to life in the bottom of the
eighth. Eagle pitcher Doug
MacNeil had been shutting out
the Panthers on I five hits.
Outﬁelder Greg Trimbur singled
for the third time in the game to
start the inning. After a fielder’s
choice, ﬁrst- baseman Matt Bianco
hit a two«run homer. A single by
Chris Ciofﬁ knocked in Blane
Vucci for the other Panther run to
make the score 4-3.

The air came out of the Panther
comeback in the top of the ninth,
when Eagle shortstop Tom
Mandile hit a homerun off of

Schnur.

Eagle Coach Rich Maloney took
MacNei1 out to open the ‘ninth.
MacNeil struck out nine Panther
batters. The new Eagle pitcher
was lefty Dave Dawson.

After shortstop Ralph McNelly
struck out to open the ninth,
Trimbur added his fourth hit of
the game. He ended up stranded
at‘ first when Rich Yuskas and
Bianco made the final outs.

The second game was not
nearly as close.

“We were going along good
until the fourth inning,” said Pitt
Coach Bobby Lewis. “Then it just
came apart for our pitcher [Bill

011 2 or student

Brash].” Brash pitched four and
two-thirds innings, giving up eight
hits and six walks.

“I brought [Denny] Terzich in,
and he just didn’t have it.” T erzich
pitched one and one-third innings
giving up four runs, four hits and
four walks.

“The field was tough the whole
day. [Boston College] ﬂew down,
and we have to get these games
in [for them],” said Lewis.

The doubleheader was
scheduled for Saturday, and single
game was for Sunday. With the
bad weather, the schedule has
been shifted one day. Today’s
game begins at noon. '

He feels that team unity played
a big factor in their success.
“Swimming here and being part
of a team brought us close

together,” he said. “When one‘
