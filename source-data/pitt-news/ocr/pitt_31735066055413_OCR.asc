Sig Eps suspended until April '97

Second fraternity
to face sanctions
this year

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

A Pitt fraternity, already on suspen-
sion by its national office for hazing,
was put on probation for over a year by
the university. .

Sigma Phi Epsilon was suspended
until April 1997 for violating Pitt’s anti-
hazing policy. The fraternity said it will
appeal the decision.

“We’re particularly concerned when
a hazing violation such as this one
involves alcohol connected with
minors,” said Dennis Donham, assistant
vice chancellor for student affairs. '

Donham sent a letter detailing the sus-
pension to Sigma Phi Epsilon president

‘ Jeff Black yesterday. In the letter,

Donham stated that the hazing incident

» “occurred with the advice and consent of

the pledge educator, who should be the
official fraternity monitor to prevent this
type of activity.”

Donham also stated in the letter that
he was concerned “that at least one indi-
vidual appears to have been restrained”
during the incident which occurred on
Nov. 29. ,

The fraternity’s appeal will be heard

by Vice Chancellor for Student and
Public Affairs Leon Haley.

“We are disappointed by the decision
of the university in light of our coopera-
tion with the investigation,”. Black said.
He declined further comment, not wanti-
ng to jeopardize the appeal. .

Donham said that the fraternity was
“very forthcoming in the investigation,
and this was the -first time Pitt has had
any problems with the group.”

But he also said, “It clearly was a haz-
ing violation.” _

Last month, Sigma Phi Epsilon’s
national office in Richmond, Va., sus-
pended the fraternity indefinitely for its
role in the hazing incident. The suspen-

sion banned alcohol at mixers.

CWO striving to educate
during ”women’s month”

Live at five:
studen t-run TV

By Marty Feick
For The Pitt News

March is National Women’s
Herstory month, and the Campus
Women’s Organization plans to
use the occasion to-boost its
influence on campus.

With three members having just
returned from a National
Women’s Coalition conference in
Washington, D.C., _CWO hopes to
use what its learned to educate
the campus.

“[Fem Expo ‘96] dealt with
women’s issues on a completely
active stance,” said Lesley
Albanese, CWO’s co—president.
She said the expo was effective

S because it presented the realities

facing women and then gave
active solutions to the problems.

CWO wants to use the same
method here on campus. Its first
mission is to shatter the false
image it believes surrounds the
organization.

“We want to break the stereo-
types of the women’s organiza-
tion,” said Albanese. ‘‘In the
words of Rush Limbaugh, we are
not ‘femi-nazis'.”’ S

She believes people get turned
off by the women’s movement
because they‘think it is too
extreme. Although that may be
true in some cases, junior Rich
Lacovara thinks differently.

‘‘I don’t think the women’s

station a possibility

Student-run television may soon be coming to
Pitt. Plans are being considered to develop a
television station to be run by students here at
the»Universit_y of Pittsburgh.

At the Student Government Board meeting
last night, board member Cyrus Zolghadri pre-
sented a video showing the possibilities for a
‘campus television" station. The station would
cover news, sports, campus activities and enter-
tainment. Other possibilities listed by Zolghadri
were distance learning and community events
calendars. _

The video was compiled from the program-

that the single body they
pulled from the wreckage was

Nine others were wounded
in the explosion. The bomb
was the third in 10 days in an

Taking time out for yourself key to sanity, direction

a chance to relive my life, I would

like to do it as an extrovert.
Extroverts, at least from an introvert’s
point of view, seem to have so much
more fun. They seem to be comfortable
in all kinds of social situations, they
seem full of chatter and gregarious
enthusiasm and they never appear to tire
of people contact. Those of us who are
more introverted do enjoy many social
situations, but it doesn’t come as easily,
and after a certain amount of socializ-
ing, we usually have to find ourselves a
quiet place to get emotionally “refu-
eled.”

This need for periods of solitude,
however, has its beneficial aspects, and
it is probably the one area where intro-
verts have something to teach their more
extroverted friends. Sometimes, socially
outgoing students enjoy and need con-
tact with others so much that they rarely

make time to be alone. When they do,
they are likely to turn on the TV or
stereo for company.

The problem with all of this external
noise, and the gen-
eral need for stimu-
lation from the out-
side, is that there is
very little time left
for personal reﬂec-
tion. When you can
spend time in cre-
ative solitude, you
can get in touch
with what you think
is important in life,
how you want to spend your time and
what contributions you want to make to
the world as your life progresses.

Being alone, in itself, is not enough. It
is using the solitude for some of these
self-exploratory activities that really
enriches your life. If you want to test

 

this out, begin setting aside some quiet
time each week and use this time to
think about what you want your life to
be like (apart from the wants of your
parents or your
peers). Begin to
write your thoughts
about these things
in a journal fre-
quently to see how
your ideas begin to
deepen and diversi-
fy as you gain
more experience
with self-analysis.
You might also
begin to pay attention to your dreams.
Write them down when you remember

them, and think about what theymight

mean. Also, write down things that you
have enjoyed in the past but haven’t
done much recently. List other things
that you have always wanted to do but

have never had the courage to try. Don’t
try to restrict these thoughts or wishes to
what you presently think is attainable.
As long as they remain in your con-
sciousness, there is still a chance that
they can happen. Remember that every-
thing we accomplish in our lives hap-
pens at least twice — once in our minds
and once in reality. We need to think
things and dream things before we can
make them happen.

The important message in all of this is
that to create a rich and meaningful life
for ourselves we need to take time for
self-analysis and reflection. lt’s not easy
to do, because we are pulled in so many
different directions. However, if we can
include creative solitude in our lives, our
understanding of ourselves and of others
will grow, and our lives will be richer
for the effort.

movement is too extreme,”
Lacovara said. “I support
them and think they should
have the same rights as men
do.”

And men are just what
CWO welcomes. Although
only a few men are active
members, CWO wants to get
the men on campus more
involved. Albanese said she
believes that being a femi-
nist is not about just being a
woman, but that it’s about
standing up for women’s
rights.

“I really want to get the
school involved, but not just
women,” said Albanese.
“We want men to participate
to help educate the student
body.”

Freshman CWO member
Margot Douaihy said that
there were thousands of
women and men at the expo
in Washington and that the
campus needs to integrate

more.

“I see a problem with the
fact that the majority of our
campus is segregated,”
Douaihy said. She said that
although there are many dif-
ferent cultural and ethnic
groups on campus, they
rarely socialize or work
together.

But CWO hopes to use the
women’s history month as
an avenue to make a change
in the way the campus inter-
acts.

“We will incorporate what
we have learned from the
workshops in D.C. and bring
that spirit to Pitt,” said Amy
Sitnick, CWO co—president.

“We are women and men
who take a stand in our lives
for ourselves,” said
Albanese. And as a member
of CWO, she hopes to
encourage Pitt's campus,
through integration, aware-
ness and education, to do the
same. ‘

Icky politician cooties

It’s started. If you don’t want to get hit by any stray pieces
of mud ﬂying around, you better go underground for the next
seven months. That's right! It’s political campaign time now,
and the name-calling is about to get into full swing.

We’ve been privy to a few minor glimpses of the campaign
circus already, and if they are any indication of what is to
come, it’s going to get ugly. Bill Clinton has begun his attack
against the Republican party as a whole, ridiculing its unwill-
ingness to compromise on the budget, its position on social
reformsand everything else the 104th Congress has done.

Unfortunately for the Republicans, the mud-slinging will
come from two sides for anyone going for the Republican
nomination. Since Clinton is running unopposed, the primary
elections are going to turn into a Republican bloodbath over
who will challenge the presidentin November. This leaves
Clinton with plenty of time to run a campaign against the

entire Republican party during the primaries and then wipe‘

up the floor with whomever is left in November.

Actually, Clinton’s job is not that difficult right now, since
he only has to sit back and watch the Republican candidates
tear each other apart over the next few months." Apparently
no one has told the Republicans that it may be more impor-
tant to get your party elected than to get yourself elected. So
the Republicans will dredge up every piece of dirt they can
find on each other and plaster it before the media, giving
Clinton all the help he needs.

Not to exclude Clinton from the mudslinging, you can be
assured that he will join i.n with both hands once the pri-

' maries are over and the Republicans pretend to like each

other again. Then we’ll also be bombarded with anti-Clinton
propaganda from the Republican candidate, which he will be
forced to sling back in kind.

Speaking of the media, you can expect to hear the mud ﬂy
everywhere youturn. Televisions are plastered, radios are
one giant sound bite for six-or-so months and don’t be sur-
prised if you turn up some propaganda on the Internet. With
technology advancing so quickly, you can bet it won’t take
the politicians long to discover cyber—mud. ‘

If over the next few months, you find yourself ready to
crawl into the storm cellar, don’t worry. You are not alone.
Political campaigning, from both parties, has b_ecome a game
of who can say what about whom the greatest number of
times. If you pay close attention, you’ll notice that you will
rarely hear what any one candidate does or believes, only
what his or her opponent didn’t do or doesn’t believe.

So how about some real issues, please? We are, after all,

adults, aren’t we? Second grade was a long time ago, and,’

we’re voting for president of the United States —- not Cootie
King. '

Charmin,

“I’ve been to hell. I spell it 
DMV.” These words of
PRIMUS describe a visit to the
Department of Motor Vehicles.
As you can imagine, the above

visit wasn’t pleasant. If you’ve

ever been to the DMV — in any
state, it doesn’t matter — then
you share a special bond with
the writer of this song. You are
among the tortured few who
have endured one of society’s
most agonizing structures: State
Bureaucracy.

Much has been said recently
about .the inefficiency of the fed-
eral government. In fact, federal
inefficiency appears to be the

_ driving force behind the current

decentralization movement that
has swept the country. It has
been argued that the federal gov-
ernment should be stripped to
the bones and should delegate its
tax revenues to the states in the
form of ‘lump-sum “block”
grants for the states to use as
they see ﬁt. It is argued that this
will streamline the process of
spending revenue and amputate
the existing malignant mass of
bureaucratic red tape. This line
of reasoning is dubious. The
shifting of responsibility to the
states will not only shift the red
tape accordingly, it will probably
increase the amount of red tape.
Furthermore, this red, tape will
no longer be uniformly draped
across the country, but will exist
as several incoherent, unpre-
dictable masses living within the
states themselves.

What limited contact I have
had with state government has
been very similar to the descrip-
tion oifered by PRIMUS. Yet, as

bad as state bureaucracy is, any- ,

one who has ever procured a
building permit in any country
will verify that local bureaucracy
is, at best, no better. In fact, I
have noticed a consistent trend
in my personal dealings with
governments on all levels: feder-
al, state and local. I have noticed
a significant decrease in my
pleasure in dealing with govem-
mentsas the level of government
decreases. It is clear that less

 

Hell and the DMV

Dash

thought and ingenuity is put into
the construction of lower-level
bureaucracies. As a perfect
example, consider income tax
retums.

As you are filling out your
income tax forms this year, ask
yourself which government you
prefer to deal with. I mean, it’s

true, the federal government has -

many more regulations, and the
laws are more complex. Despite

‘ this, filling out federal tax forms

requires much less effort than
state tax forms. This year, feder-
al income tax returns can be
ﬁled entirely over the phone by

. answering a total of three ques-

tions, a truly pleasant experi-
ence. The Pennsylvania income
tax return is more complicated,
despite the fact that the laws
should be more “streamlined.”
The instructions simply are not
as simple and as well thought
out as the federal’s. Finally, the
Pittsburgh City income tax‘
return is more like a bureaucratic
jigsaw puzzle. Just try to go fill
it out for yourself, and you’ll see
what I mean. Furthermore, U.S.
tax returns get to you within a
month or two, but state checks
take two to three times that. ’

I contend here that, the most
signiﬁcant U.S. political move-
ment in the past few decades is
primarily based on a fallacy. It’s
based on the age-old fallacy that
the grass is always greener on
the other side. That is, the people
who are driving this movement
have lived under a strong cen-
tralized government all their
lives. They don’t know the hor-
rors of state governments.
People don’t realize that the

-..4..:-_ . _ . . a . ; \ « . 4 \ . . . t . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..

level of waste and ineﬂiciency in
state and local governments is
considerably greater than at the
federal level. The federal gov-
ernment provides uniformity
and, therefore, eﬁiciency. . '
Think about it. If you were in
charge of supplying the toiletries
for a donn, you have two choic-
es. You could buy a truckload of

"white Charmin and distribute the

rolls out to the entire dorm, or
you could give each floor an
allowance to go to Giant Eagle
and buy its own. Which system
is more reliable and saves more
money? In which system is the
money more likely to get spent
at the local tavern?

The only valid argument I
have heard for decentralization
is the fact that non—uniformity
means more diversity. This is a
good argument. The dorm resi-
dents can buy whatever brand of
toilet paper they want, and they
can get the color that matches
the toilet seat. This diversity in
toilet paper is a good thing. The
question, however, is the follow-
ing: Is the advantage of added
diversity more desirable than the
high cost and lack of efﬁciency?
When considering this question,
we must realize that the cost of
added diversity will be fewer
overall beneﬁts to the country.
The problem, I contend, is that
no one is even considering this
question because of the above-
mentioned fallacy.

If we want to radically alter

government by giving more

responsibility to the states, we

should see these changes for,

what they are. There are some
advantages,-to be sure: however,
these have not been publicly
emphasized. Furthermore, what
have been emphasized are cost-

effectiveness and efficiency, but .

these will be greatly decreased
by decentralization. We should

think about this before we unin- 4

tentionally get ourselves into a
mess. Otherwise, I’ll see you in
hell.

The Pitt News, Wednesday, February 2:, 1996

Pick your month

I would like to take a moment
to talk about Jason Curtis’ arti-
cle “What about how to get
somewhere in lifc_month.”
Curtis is correct regarding the
use of such a month. The time

is wasted. However, if there

was no racism in America then
there would be no need for spe-
cial months for any individual
group. All the contributions to
mankind made by all
Americans (regardless of color)
would be accounted for in acad-
emics so that all can appreciate
them. It is this racism that
forces cultural groups to use an
awareness month.

Mr. Curtis, you do not know '
‘ the depth of Black History and

it shows in your feeble charac-
terizations of Dr. Washington
Carver. This is a perfect exam-
ple of the reasoning behind
Black History Month. You

should know that he was an
important botanist who showed
100 different uses for the
peanut, not just as a food prod-
uct. What other endeavors have
been accomplished because of
his research into the use of
plants?

Lastly, Mr. Curtis, persecu-
tion of Blacks should never be
compared to others. Yes, we
have earned our right to have a
month if we want one. This has
nothing to do with what others
have earned for their cultural
groups. The fact that other cul-
tural groups do not have an
awareness month is not our
concern. If you are of one of
those other groups, then take a
month — there are 11 others.-
Black people won’t stop you.
As Curtis so eloquently stated,

‘we have more important things

to worry about.

Pitt hoops:
A Homeric
tragedy

    

Columnist
Sean
Duncan

eus sent me a dream in
2 early November. But
much like the one that
Zeus sent to Agamemnon, the
famed Greek king in Homer’s
The Iliad, the dream was false.
Although Agamemnon
couldn’t be reached for com-
ment, I’m sure he shares my
sentiments. You see, back
around 1250 B.C., Zeus told
Agamemnon through a dream
that if he acted immediately, he
could take the Trojans in war.
So without hesitation,
Agarnemnon' corralled his
Greek troops, sacrificed his
daughter to get the winds blow-
ing and set out to war.
Although Agamemnon was
without his best warrior,
Achilles, he had no reason to
question Zeus, the king of gods.
‘ He should have. The Greeks
and Trojans fought for nine

bloody years.

Just like Agamemnon, I had

' no reason to doubt" Zeus. He

told me before the 1995-96 sea-
son started that Pitt’s basketball
team would rise to national
prominence. He said the
Panthers would make a surprise
attack on the snoozing Big East
competition and stomp into the
NCAA Tournament with
momentum not even a sibling
sacrifice could withstand.

I feel betrayed.

Mired in a surprisingly bad
season, the Panthers had all the
promise in Olympia on their
side. Pitt landed one of the
nation’s best recruiting classes,
had a couple of transfers com-

ing in and, unlike Agamemnon,-

the Panthers had their top war-
rior returning, point guard Jerry
McCullough.

But what Zeus didn’_tforesee
was that McCullough and King
Ralph Willard couldn’t see eye
to eye. Willard benched his star
warrior in two different
instances this year. That appar-
ently has disrupted Pitt’s ﬁght-
ing chemistry, resulting in a
dismal 9-14 season and losses
in 11 of its last 12 games.

That situation sounds vague-
ly familiar. Early in The Iliad,
Agamemnon and Achilles had
a major disagreement. The
result was Achilles’ refusal to
ﬁght in the Trojan War. No
matter how hard any of the
Greeks pleaded, it didn’t mat-

Pitt blows 20-point  
leacl, loses to lowly
Rutgers by one, again

By Brad Isles
Sports Editor

Rutgers’ Damon Santiago broke around two screens, took an
inbound pass from Albert Kamer, turned around in a crowd of
players in the left comer and tossed up a 3-pointer with one sec-
ond left in the game.

The Scarlet Knight bench erupted.

Pitt’s stood in disbelief. _

As Rutgers celebrated at halfcourt, Pitt center Gerald Jordan
walked off the Field House court holding his eyes — a 71-70
loss searing his mind.

‘This is obviously about the toughest loss I’ve ever been
around in 26 years of coaching,” said Pitt Head Coach Ralph
Willard. “It’s a very tough experience for us all to go through.
It’s a tremendously devastating feeling when you play with
some intensity and execution for 33 minutes and then have the
roof fall in.” . . '

Forward Chad Varga, who finished with 15 points before foul-
ing out with 3:39 left, said, “It’s frustrating. It doesn’t make any
sense. We don’t understand why, but again, we found a way to
lose.”

For Rutgers, a Big East newcomer this season, it was its ﬁrst-
ever conference road win. It was also its first-ever conference

. sweep of a season series. The Scarlet Knights beat Pitt by one,

78-77, on Jan. 17.

“This team never ever gives up,” said Rutgers Head Coach
Bob Wenzel; “To come from behind by as far as we were,
Damon is the extra-special hero.”

The loss was Pitt’s 11th in its last 12 games, as the Panthers
fall to 9-14 overall and 4-11 in the Big East. They claim sole
possession of the basement in the Big East 7 bracket. Rutgers
moves to 8- 15 overall and 5-10 in the conference. ,

Jason Maile hit a 3-pointer from the left baseline with 7:23
remaining to give Pitt a 20-point (66-46) lead. It was the
Panthers’ last ﬁeld goal of the game, while Rutgers went on a

Pitt lacrosse annihilates WVCC, 14-2

. By Matt Townsend
Staff Writer

Before last’ Friday night’s
lacrosse game Coach Gary Neff

had his team huddled on the
sideline. Trying to invoke enthu-
siasm in his players, he yelled,
“This is where it starts. Any suc-

' cess we have this year starts

a

tonight.”

The team responded with a
14-2 whitewash of Western
Virginia Community College.’

Pitt was penalized for slashing
early in the game, and the ensu-
ing Virginia power play led to a
Virginia goal and a 1-0 advan-
tage.

After several Pitt possessions
resulted in no scores, Rob Heaps
wound up from 20 feet and blis-
tered a shot from the point past
two defenders and the goalie,
making it a 1-1 tie.

From behind the net at his left
attack position, Mike Tanniru
caught a pass and looked for a
cutter in front of the net but
couldn’t find one. A defender
came at him, and he juked left,
went right and stuffed the ball
top shelf to give Pitt the lead 2-1.

The first-quarter scoring ended _

with a feed from behind the net
to Pat Shea, who scored on a
bounce shot making the score 3-
1.

“We started off slow, but we
always do. It’s a trademark of

. ours,” said Neff.

Off the second-quarter face-off

way in close and scored on a low
lining shot, 4-1. A
Tanniru was again looking for
a cutter from behind the net, and
this time he found Rob Heaps all
alone on the right side for an
easy one-timer and a 5-1 lead.
Bret Meyerkincack pushed the
lead to 6-1 with an unassisted
goal from the right side, in which
he found the five hole of the
goalie'on a bounce shot.
Throughout the second quar.-'
ter, the defense 7 stopped

Virginia’s offense in all facets of A

the game. John Forrest intercept-
ed several passes and then made
precise outlet passes that led to
fast breaks and scoring chances.

Pitt’s big defenders used their
size to knock around the smaller
attackers for Virginia. When they
would get in close.to the goal,
two or three Panthers would
sandwich the player, knocking
the ball loose.

‘The defense ate them alive?’
said Neff. “We are going to
intimidate a lot of people
because we are big, and that’
good.” - ’

Pitt and Rutgers battle from beyond the arc in Panther loss

By Matt Grove
Staff Writer

Everyone has a different name
for the art. Some people call it the
“trey,” some the “trifecta,” and a
select few like to use “three-ball.”
Many prefer “dialing long dis-
tance” or “from way downtown,”
but regardless of what you call it,
the 3-point shot has changed col-

1 lege basketballas we know it.

Last night at the Fitzgerald Field‘
House, two of the Big East’s lead-
ers in 3-point shooting met as the
Panthers hosted the Scarlet Knights

of Rutgers. The Panthers came into -
' the game second in the conference

with 7.23 3-pointers per game. The
Scarlet Knights entered at fourth
with 6.77 per contest.

Both teams raised those averages
in the 71-70 Rutgers win. Pitt made
9-of-19 attempts, while Rutgers
knocked down 8-of-l5 attempts.

Panther guard Jason Maile has
seen limited action this year, aver-
aging only 10.7 minutes and 4.6

‘ points per game.‘ Coming into the

game against Rutgers, Maile had
been shooting 34 percent from 3-
point range, 17-for-49. Last night
he scored a team-high 18 points, all
coming from beyond the arc.

Rutgers’ Damon Santiago came
into last night’s win fourth in the
conference averaging 2.5 made 3-
pointers per game. Last night he
improved his numbers by hitting 6-
of—7 threes, including the game-
winner at the buzzer.

The Panthers made 5-of-12 3-
pointers in the first half as they
jumped out to an early lead and led
41-28 going into halftime. The
Scarlet Knights managed only 2—of-
6 threes in the first half, one by
Santiago. -

Pitt got an early three from Kevin
Willard and three more from Maile
as it built its biggest lead of the
game, 66-46, at the 7:23 mark of
the second half. The Panthers had
the hot hand from long range.

It only took 14 seconds for the
hot hand to change. At-the 7:09
mark, Geoff Billett found Albert
Kamer in the comer for his only 3-

pointer of the game. After four
straight points by Rutgers’ Rob
Hodgson, Santiago knocked down
his fourth 3-pointer to cut the lead
to 11 with less than five minutes
left

Down the stretch, the Scarlet
Knights were forced to look for the
3-pointers, and they responded.
Billett and Santiago each made
treys with under three minutes left
to cut the lead to four at 70-66.

Billett made two free throws with
43 seconds remaining to cut the
lead to 70-68. A turnover by Kevin
Willard‘ gave Rutgers the ball with
11 seconds left. Santiago missed his
only 3-pointer of. the game from the
right corner, but the Scarlet Knights
recovered the loose ball with one

second and called timeout to set up ;

a play. .

Santiago came off two screens
and got a good look at the basket
from the left-hand comer.

“I didn’t think it would go in. I
just wanted to get it off, and once I

Dome not endearing for Big East track athletes

 

' Siaﬁjwriter
SYRACUSE, N.Y. _— Even before the

By Geoﬂ‘ Moak

curtain came up on the Big East Indoor
Track and Field Championship meet, it
was apparent that the theater wasn’t good
enough for the show. Carrier Dome offi-

event for much of the weekend.

On Friday, the Pitt team arrived in
Syracuse and went to the Dome around
5:30 p.m. for a short practice. The lights
were tumedoff promptly at 6:00 p.m.,
exactly as the schedule said they would
be. But the lights illuminating the
Syracuse men’s basketball practice,
being held at the opposite end of the
dome ﬂoor, remained on.

Pitt senior Dennis Kuntz sarcastically
explained, “You know, a basketball prac-
tice is more important than the Big East
championship.”

cials treated the meet as a second-class A

Afterthe that day of competition, there

_ was an announcement as soon as the.last

event ended that the building would
close in five minutes. No time for ath-
letes to recover from their events, barely
enough to gather belongings and get out.
And after the second day, the cleanup
crew began work before the awards cere-
mony even began.

This sort of management treatment did
nothing to endear the Carrier Dome to
the legions of athletes who already didn’t
like the track itself. The wide turns and
short straightaways are unpopular with
runners in events from the 200 meters up
to the 5000. '

The track is almost circular, hardly an
oval at all, making it hard to pass people
and generally causing times to be slower
than usual. And. the ﬁeld event facilities
had faults, too.

“Ijdon’t like the short straights on the
track.‘As far as the pits [for long and

triple jumps], a runway’s a runway to
me. The sand is higher than most,” said
Pitt pentattilete Curtis Anderson. “I just
don’tlike this dome.”

While virtually nobody had any nice
things to say about the Carrier Dome, it
was impossible not to respect the athletes
inside it. They cared about the meet,
regardless of what anyone else thought

The athletes, when they weren’t com-
peting, were the best cheerleading crew
any team could hope for. Their voices,
particularly those of the Pitt women,
breathed life into the Carrier Dome. As
the meet wore on and the athletes were
supposed to get more tired, they just got
louder. _

The cheers must have done something
to inspire the athletes. Pitt Head Coach
Steve Lewis called Anderson’s third-
place performance in the pentathlon “the
hardest six points l’ve ever seen anybody
get.” Anthony Dorsett became the

. Big East, one of the toughest conferences

_ tional efforts.”

Panthers’ latest national qualiﬁer with his
performance in the 55 meters. A grand
total of 15 Pitt individuals and relay
teams .ﬁnished among the top four in the

“I personally am proud of everybody,”
Lewis said. “Therewere some inspira-

There can be little doubt that Stephanie
Ellsworth’s was among the most inspira-
tional efforts of the meet, if not of the
season. Less than 400 meters into her
5000-‘meter race, Ellsworth got caught in
a pack of runners, all trying to break
from the rest. She fell, and the subse-
quent trampling looked like the rumiing
of the bulls -— bulls wearing quarter-inch ‘
spikes on their hooves. Ellsworth got up,
“blood ﬂying everywhere,” and contin-
ued running. '

Track

°From page

covered with blood, said, “It
feels like it cut right through my
ﬁnger.”  ‘ i  I A

It looked like the spike cut
right through her finger, too.
Ellsworth managed to escape
the training room with only two
stitches in her left ring finger
and some ugly brush burns.

The most amazing part of the

A story is that Ellsworth had a fan-

tastic race. Her time of 18:32
was just four seconds off her
best time ever in the event, and
she spent six seconds of the race
lying on the track.

Ellsworth’s character was
matched_by the men’s team
from Connecticut. At the end of
the meet, their apparent charnpi-
onship taken away from them
by a controversial disqualifica-
tion, they sat quietly in the
infield. Not looking for someone
to protest to, not saying any-
thing. They just waited quietly
to accept their second-place
award.

Carrier Dome ofﬁcials kindly
left the lights on long enough for
the Huskies to see their trophy.

Column-

ter. Achilles was dead-set in
his decision. It wasn’t until late
in the war that Achilles chose
to fight, but that was only
because his best friend was
killed and humiliated. When
Achilles came to ﬁght, he
kicked major Trojan booty,
thus spawning the premise of
The Iliad, “The Wrath of
Achilles.” .

Now don’t get me wrong.
I'm not saying that this chapter
of Pitt basketball will be called
“The Wrath of McCullough”
Or that Willard was wrong to A
bench him. I’ll leave that deci-
sion up to you.

But whatl am saying is this:
Pitt is in desperate need of an
attitude and chemistry change.
Willard even admitted it. After
the Panthers lost to the pathetic
Notre Dame Fighting Irish last
week, Willard stated in the
postgame interview that no
team he has ever coached has
not gotten better as the year
progressed. In fact, Willard
said that it has gotten worse.

He also mentioned that his
team has developed distinct
cliques between the freshmen
and the upperclassmen.
Whether that’s attributable to
all the hype the freshmen
received before and during the
season is beyond me.

However, I do know that this
Panther squad has seriously
underachieved.

Blame it on cliques. Blame it
on chemistry. Blame it on
Zeus’ will. But whatever you
choose to blame it on, keep
this in mind: Although the
Greek camp lost thousands of
men in battle and suffered
through tumultuous times, it

~ still ended up winning the war.

Sean Duncan is the managing
editor for The Pitt News and is
still pissed about Zeus’ false
dream. -

Hoops

°From page 7

25-4 run to finish the game.

With 2:39 left, guard Geoff Billet hit a three from the right wing.
Jerry McCullough had trouble handling the ball at halfcourt, and
Santiago picked up the loose ball and went in for a layup, making it
70-63.

Then, with 43 seconds to go, Billet, the fourth-best foul shooter in
the country (91 percent), went to the line for two shots. He hit both
attempts to cut Pitt’s lead to two points, the closest Rutgers had been
since it trailed, 9-8 with 13:15 left in the ﬁrst half.

VV1th time winding down and Pitt controlling the ball, there was a
seven-second diﬁerence between the shot clock and the game clock.
Willard drove into the lane and lost the ball before he could get a shot
olf.

Rutgers rushed to the other end of the court, and Santiago got off a
lO—footer from the left baseline. It bounced out, and Rutgers regained
possession and called timeout with one second left.

During the timeout, Rutgers set up a play for Santiago to get it.

“Coach set it up so it looked like I would come straight across for the
ball, but in reality I had to go underneath the basket,” Santiago said.
“Fortunately for us they set some good screens, and I was able to get it
off in time.” ‘

He got the shot off, but unlike Larry Bird in the 1989 NBA 3-point
shooting contest, he wasn’t sure it was good.

“I didn’t think it would go in,” Santiago said. “I just wanted to get it
off. And once I got it off it seemed like it took forever to go in. Ifl had
enough time to ‘cross my ﬁngers and run to the church, then I would
have.” -

The shot capped off a half during which Rutgers outscored Pitt, 43-
29, countering the Panthers’ 41-28 halftime advantage.

Santiago ﬁnished with a game-high 25 points and shot 6 of 7 from if

behind the arc. Maile matched him, shooting 6 of 10 to ﬁnish with 18
points, leading the Panthers.
Once Varga fouled out, his vacancy on the inside allowed Rutgers to

penetrate Pitt’s zone defense and get fouled or to kick the ball out to the ‘

perimeter for 3-point attempts.
, “I learned a valuable lesson tonight. The team needs me in there,”
Varga said.

The Scarlet Knights, last in the Big East in ﬁeld goal percentage

(.397), shot 45 percent, including 53 percent on 3-pointers.

It also gave Rutgers the opportunity to grab important rebounds
down the stretch. They are last in rebounding margin, getting outre-
bounded in conference games ‘by six. But against Pitt, Rutgers won the
battles undemeath, finishing with a 34-29 edge.

“This is hopefully something the young kids will look back upon in
a cguple years and say it was the start of something positive,” Willard
sai .
