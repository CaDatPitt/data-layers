TEMPE, Ariz. — When Ohio
State split end Thad Jemison
snatched Mike Tomsczak’s 39-yard
pass with 39 seconds remaining, the
Buckeyes (9-3) clinched a 28-23
Fiesta Bowl victory.

Just two minutes earlier, the gal-
lant Panthers (8-3-1) had surged to
their first lead, 23-21, on Pitt kicker
Snuffy Everett's 37-yard field goal
into a stiff swirling Arizona wind.

The loss was a difficult blow to
take after trailing from the outset
and finally grabbing the lead.

“When you lose like this, it breaks
your heart,” Panther coach Foge
Fazio said. “We played so very, very
hard to get ahead. We came here to
win, and it’s just very difficult to
accept this loss, especially for our
seniors."

“After the Penn State tie and now
this loss, I don’t have too much left
inside,” Panther quarterback and
offensive player-of-the-game John
Congemi said. “But we'll regroup.
We'll be back. Next year, we‘re

i gonna have an excellent team.

A Pitt mathematics professor,
forced to leave the Soviet Union
at the request of government
officials last November, has
returned to his position at Pitt.

The reason for Professor'Nor-
man J. Zabusky's expulsion is

-still unclear. He said he was
expelled for speaking with refus-
nik Jewish scientists. Refusnik
refers to those who apply for
emigration’ and are refused by
the Soviet government.

The Soviet Academy of
Scientists called Zabusky‘s,con-
duct “incompatible with the sta-
tus of a guest of the academy on

* an official exchange” but did not

cite the meetings with refusnik
scientists as a reason for the
request.

The National Academy of
Sciences in Washington D.C.
confirmed it received the Soviet’s
explanation and added it is mak-
ing its own inquiries to find out
exactly why Zabusky was asked
to leave.

Public Affairs Director of the
National Academy of Sciences
Office Barbara Gorgenson said
there has been an exchange of
telexes between the two coun-
tries and that the matter is still
being investigated.

“No one is pleased it hap-
pened,” Gorgenson said.
“Zabusky was part of a non-
governmental bi-lateral
exchange program [between the
National Academy of Scientists
and the Soviet \ Academy of
Scientistsl.” For this reason, the
academy has assumed some
responsibility for Zabusky‘s
actions. »

Zabusky said he had been
invited to the Institute of Physics
at the University of Kiev to speak

on contour dynamics —- the use
of space curves to describe fluid
motion. He said he was later no-
tified formally through the U.S.
Embassy that the Soviet
Academy had called and asked
that he leave before Nov. 5.
Zabusky left the Soviet Union on
Nov. 4 and chose to stay in
Munich, West Germany.

“I was expelled for speaking to
[refusnik] scientists," Zabusky
explained. ‘‘In the past, nothing
of this sort happened. This is a
sign that tensions [between the

U.S. and
increasing."
rZabusky’s knowledge stems
from his participation in an
international seminar held in a
refusnik’s apartment in I980.
He described the lives of refus-
niks as being “trapped as prison-
ers in their own country.” He
said they lose their jobs after
their emigration requests are
denied and are stripped of many
privileges, such as access to
libraries.
“They are deprived of their

livelihood and what keeps their
spirits up," he said.

There are several hundred
thousand Jews in the Soviet
Union who have applied for emi-
gration and have been denied,
according to Rabbi Bernard A.
Poupksbeao of the Shaare Torah
Synagogue in Pittsburgh.

“Efforts are made to keep in
touch with refusniks to encour-
age them in their struggle to leave
the U.S.S.R. ,” Poupko said.
Zabusky, Poupko explained,
wanted to be in touch with the
refusniks, but it is Soviet policy
to sever contacts with refusniks
and keep them isolated.

Poupko, born in the Soviet
Union, has returned to the Soviet A
Union three times, but he will not
be allowed to return again
because of Soviet suspicions that
he is in the service of the State
Department.

“Refusniks are not fighting the
Soviet regime; they have only

Up in the air

By Cheryl Sirko
The Pitt News

The land-air emergency transpor-
tation system which was scheduled
to begin serving Oakland hospitals
last November is awaiting approval
by the state’s health agencies.

The state’s Health’ Systems
Agency is still reviewing the STAT
program“— Specialized Treatment
and Air Transport -— to determine if
the city should have a second emer-
gency air transport service. The Life—
Flight helicopter currently provides
such a service.

Karen Mohan, coordinator of the
new transportation system, said that
the issue of duplicating a service
already provided by LifeFlight is
among the reasons for the state’s
delay in its review.

“STAT services will be delayed
until the government determines a
certification of need,” Mohan said.
“The state is trying to prevent a
duplication "of services."

Rege Bobonus, director of public
relations at Mercy Hospital, said
that the agency’s decision is
expected by the middle of January.
He called the temporary delay
“standard procedure.”

Mercy Hospital is one of the four»

participating hospitals scheduled to
use the emergency service. The oth-
ers are Children’s, Magee-Women’s

 

 

 

‘Competing systems have worked

elsewhere ’

-Rege Bobonus

and Presbyterian-University.

Bobonus defended the second air '

transportation system saying,
“Competing sytems have worked
elsewhere. Studies indicate that this
area needs better access to
hospitals."

The STAT team will consist of a
physician, an emergency resident, an

A emergency transport specialist and a

registered nurse or paramedic.

STAT project 0 awaits approval

According to Mohan, the cost for
each use of the service will be
approximately $1000. Mohan said
that insurance policies such as Blue
Cross should absorb much of that
cost.

The STAT helicopter can travel
up to 150 miles per hour, which is
almost three times as fast as an
ambulance. It would be used for
only the most severe cases.

ln Brief  

Pitt to participate in debate

The University of Pittsburgh is one of a field of 23 Pennsylvania
colleges and universities to participate in the third annual Pennsylva-
nia College Energy Debates. The debates are sponsored by the Pen-
nsylvania Electric Association and the Westinghouse Electric
Corporation. The question to be debated this year is: “Has America
resolved the energy crisis of the mid— to late-l970s?”

The debates, as in previous years, will be patterned after the televi-
sion program, “The Advocates.” Each team will have a lead advocate,
who states the team’s position, and up to three “expert” witnesses, who

' will be examined directly by the lead advocate and then cross-

examined by the lead advocate of the opposing team.

Each team must be prepared to argue both sides ofthe question and
will have to argue both sides during the course of regional and final
competition. Teams will not be told which side of the question they
will have to defend until immediately prior to the debate.

Busway dedication for Martin
Luther King ]r. set

Rededication ceremonies to formally rename Port Authority Tran-
sit’s East Busway in memory of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. have been
scheduled for Jan. 15, I984. Representatives of churches and neigh-
borhood and community organizations will assemble with public
officials for a brief dedication program near the busway’s Downtown-
Grant St. entrance. Shortly thereafter, another program will take
place at the Wilkinsburg Terminus of the busway.

At each location, plaques will be unveiled designating the express-
way as the Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway, the name legally
adopted by the Port Authority Board two months ago.

Pitt students
suffer ‘reel’
disadvantage

By Cheryl B. Williams
The Pitt News

Students at Penn State University
can take advantage of a recording
service unavailable at most college
campuses.

The “Dial Access" program at
Penn State records lectures and
makes them available through that
university’s learning center. The
recording sessions, which are
arranged at the request ofthe profes-
sor, are catalogued by number and
kept on file at the center.

Penn State originally introduced
the service as a supplementary aid
for foreign language classes.

Pitt offers a similar recording ser-

vice used mainly by science and

music professors.

According to Kathy Matesic,
assistant director of media services
at Pitt’s University Center for
Instructional Resources (UCIR),
professors a_re responsible for taping
their lectures. The cassette tapes,
which are supplied by the depart-
ment, are sent to the UCIR for
copies. The tapes are then made
available to students.

Unlike Pitt students, students at
Penn State "may use the service
through any of the 150 “dial sta-
tions" located throughout the cam-
pus, according to Penn State‘s
coordinator, Barbara Penman. The
dial stations are areas where the dial-

 access telephones are provided with

directories listing the number of
each lecture tape. Students call the
center and request the tapes, which
are then played over the telephone.

Penman said that although the
service is helpful to students, it has
been widely abused.

“We don't quite know how to han-
dle it. We are supposed to be a sup-
plementary aid, and students have
been using the service instead of
attending classes."

Pitt chemistry professor Michael

.8 Golde said such an extensive service

would be useful at Pitt as long as
students use it only as a supplement.

“lt would be ideal for students
who attend class, but '1 don’t
approve of it for students who over-
sleep,” he said.

Intern-Ships Sunk

Last month’s Senate Council vote calling for the Internship
Office to be kept indefinitely “as is” is an unwelcome develop-
ment for Pitt undergraduates. As it stands, the office is strug-
gling along with only one part-time graduate assistant as its
staff. This is unacceptable.

For six months, the administration has toyed with the sensi-
tive issue of the Internship Office, arriving at no clear policy on
the the future of this most vital service. The administration has
hidden behind the pretense that diminishing federal aid has
forced the university to make dramatic cuts in the office’s
operating budget.

Granted, federal aid cuts have affected higher education.
However, opponents of the Internship Office cutbacks, such as
Pitt professor of law Ronald Brand (a member of the Budget
Policies Committee), have proven that the present tuition rate
is adequate to fund the office at its previous level with a
ﬁve—member staff.

Beyond this fiscal argument lies the fact that the office
provides numerous benefits to the student body, the university
and the local business community.

In these times of dwindlingjob opportunities, an internship
allows a student to gain “real world”experiences and to supple-
ment what has been learned in the classroom. The university
gains excellent public relations by sending its most qualified
students to intern at companies. This in turn will hopefully
make companies think favorably of Pitt graduates the next
time job openings are available.

Several university departments have started their own inter-
ship offices. While this is helpful for students in specialized
majors, for the majority of students, a central internship office
provides the best link between the academic and business
worlds. A central office also allows businesses to contact the
university more easily when in search of potential interns.

The cutbacks in the_ Internship Office should be stopped and
the services be returned to a full-time level. Belt tightening is
inevitable in these economically troubled times, but students
should not be forced to sacrifice one of their most valuable
services.

Crystal ball reveals conservative gains in ‘84

After many long hours of reading
Tarot cards and looking into my
crystal ball, I have made my predic-
tions for 1984. Accuracy is guaran-
teed by the Fortune Tellers Local
Union 138.

0Walter Mondale will win the
Democratic nomination. John
Glenn just doesn’t have the organi-
zation nor the issue appeal to catch
Mondale.

0Don‘t be surprised to see Jesse
Jackson as one of Mondale’s major
supporters by convention time.
Although Jackson talks tough about
not supporting the Democratic
nominee, he firmly believes Reagan
is the worst of the potential evils.
Mondale will use some strong rhe-
toric to woo black voters, and Jack-
son will urge his followers to pull the
Democratic lever.

0President Reagan will surely run
for reelection. Had he decided not to
run, he would have made his deci-
sion public to allow his party an ade-
quaie organizational period.

0Reagan will win a majority(not a
plurality) of the votes in November.
He has broad-based centrist sup-
port, and the right wing has nowhere
else to turn. The only hope for the
Democrats is a huge minority turn-
out on election day, but even that
will probably not be enough. The
gender gap may be an important
issue, but it is not going to signifi-
cantly translate into Democratic
votes.

OThe big issue for the Democrats
will be foreign policy. They will ask,
“Do you feel safer now than you did
four years ago?” This is an emo-
tional and controversial issue, but
there is enough fear of the Soviets in
this country to both continue the
arms buildup and reelect the
president.

0Reagan will win big in ’84 on the
strength of the economy. Unem-
ployment and “fairness" are the two
issues he must overcome, but neither
will prove insurmountable. People
currently employed don’t fear immi-

nentjob loss as much as they did last
year, and “fairness”just isn’t a vot-
ing issue for many. With inﬂation
down and the stock market up. peo-
ples’ pocketbooks will convince
them to say “four more years.“

0Don’t expect any arms-control
initiatives in ‘84 by either super-
power. The combination of an
upcoming election in the West and a
missing Andropov in the East makes
any breakthrough a longshot.

0Next year will be an especially
bitter year in Congress. Rebellion by
moderate Republicans (Spector and
Heinz are good examples) against
their conservative leadership will
decrease the number of votes along
party lines. Votes on the military
budget, entitlement programs, tax
increases and reduction ofthe deficit
will make some strange bedfellows
and bring on the threat of presiden-
tial vetoes as well.

0Watch Senator Dole and his pol-
itical allies closely in their fight to
reduce the deficit. Fiscal responsibil-

ity will be the biggest domestic issue
in ‘84, and the growing trend is for
an increase in taxes combined with a
decrease in the military budget. If
there is no tax increase in ‘84, and
Reagan says there won’t be , there
will definitely be one during the first
quarter of ‘85.

0You are going to be surprised,
but no American combat troops will
remain in Lebanon at the year‘s end.
The administration is groping for an
excuse to exit honorably, and it’s my
guess that they will find one in the
next twelve months. The most likely
explanation will be that “the Leba-
nese army is now ready to assert
itself.” American troop departure
will be replaced by military equip-
ment and advisors.

0Central America will soon return
to the center stage of American for-
eign policy. Honduras and El Salva-
dor seem to be the most likely spots
for direct U.S. military involvement
abroad. Future gains by the Salva-
doran rebels could persuade Reagan

to send troops in defense of the Sal-
vadoran government.

An even more frightening scena-
rio lies on the Honduran-
Nicaraguan border. “Contra"camps
within Honduran territory may V
eventually provoke Nicaragua into‘!
invading southern Honduras much
the same way Israel invaded south-
ern Lebanon. If the Hondurans
began to lose. American forces
would no doubt come to their
rescue.

0You will be glad to know that
Chase Manhattan, Mellon and
friends will still be solvent come
I985. Bilateral (public and private)
and multilateral loans will allow
Brazil, Mexico and Argentina to roll
over and reschedule their current
debts. My confidence stems fromtheg
presence of important incentives to
both debtors and creditors for
arranging some form of
compromise.

Last minute bomb snuffs Pitt, 28-23

David Petkiewicz/ Uri}; '

Senior tailback Joe McCall hurdles the Buckeye defense for a first quarter first down. On the day, McCall rushed for 1 15 yards on 26 carries

continued from page one

“You can’t say enough about the
seniors. This game was typical ofthe
effort that they have put forth all
season.”

From the game‘s opening gun,
Pitt knew that containing the high-
powered Ohio State attack would be
no easy task. The Buckeyes went 64
yards in nine plays, elapsing only
l:43 on the clock, for the first seven
points.

Pitt came right back with a drive
of its own. Eleven plays for 57 yards
resulted in a missed 33-yard field
goal try by Everett.

The Buckeyes moved the ball con-
sistently throughout the first half
but stopped themselves with penal-
ties and a costly fumble that the
Panthers converted into seven
points.

After a 17-yard completion by
Tomsczak to Jemison that gave
Ohio State a first down at the Pitt
45-yard line, Tomsczak fumbled the
snap, and the Panthers’ Steve Apke
recovered.

Pitt wasted little time, 1:35, while
travelling 57 yards on six plays to
even the score at seven. Tight end
Clint Wilson caught the six-yard
Congemi touchdown pass after tail-

heart. ’

——Foge Fazio

back Joe McCall latched onto a 42-
yard sideline aerial that put the
Panthers at the Ohio State 10.

The Buckeyes mounted two addi-
tional drives before the first half
came to its completion.

The first, 5| yards, ended at the
Pitt 29, with a missed 46-yard field
goal by Rich Spangler.

The second resulted in seven
points and a l4-7 halftime lead. Fol-
lowing Jemison’s fifth reception of
the half, this one good for 18 yards,
the Buckeyes had first and goal at
the Pitt 2. Two plays later‘, tailback
Keith Byers dove over for the score.

The second half belonged to the
Panthers as they displayed just how
versatile their offense can be, rack-
ing up 294 yards of offense and scor-
ing l6 points, all of which came in
the fourth quarter. The Pitt defense

shut down the OSU rushing attack
and held the offense off the board
until a mere :39 remained.

Despite Mark Bailey‘s fumbling
the opening kickoff of the second
half, the Pitt defense stiffened, and
the Buckeyes failed on fourth and
eight from the Pitt 29.

Neither team could put together a
drive until the Panthers took over
with 2:26 left in the third quarter
with the ball resting at the Pitt 48.

Despite illegal procedure (5 yards)
and clipping (l5 yards) penalties
against Pitt, Congemi found split
end Jeff Casper on a crucial third-
down—and-2l-yards-to-go situation.
The play went for 25 yards and a first
down at the OSU 40.

Congemi then hit Wallace for 14
yards and another first down. After
a sack by nose guard Spencer Nelms,

the Panthers faced a third-down-
_and-l5 situation. Casper came
through again with a clutch l8-yard
reception and a first down at the l3.

On the final play of the drive,

.McCall carried around the right end

for l3 yards but fumbled into the
end zone. Opportunistic tight end
Wilson fell on the loose ball for his
second touchdown, and the Pan-
thers had tied the_game at l4-I4" with
l4:2l to go.

A Fiesta Bowl victory looked
likely for Pitt. lt was then that disas-
ter struck. With Pat Viancourt kick-
ing off, Byers fielded the ball at the
OSU one and raced 99 yards for a
colossal score. The Panthers could
have laid down and died, but they
didn't.

Congemi marched his unit 7l
yards on ll plays — a steady drive
highlighted by a l6-yard reception
by Wallace and a 14-yard pass play
to Dwight Collins, who was running
turn-in route, for the touchdown.

The touchdown catch was the
24th of Collins‘ career and set a new
Pitt record. His 72 yards receiving
moved him into first place in Pitt
career receiving yardage with 2,264.

With the score 2|-20 and the
Panthers owning the 20, Fazio

decided to gamble a little and go for
the two point conversion. Congemi
failed while trying to find a well
covered Wilson. V . ~

After the game, Fazio said he
went for the two-pointer because" he
“was tired of being behind and
wanted to see what Earle [Bruce,
OSU coach] would do if he was
behind.”

Pitt was able to stop OSU on its
next possession at the Pitt 44-yard
line. Tommy Flynn made a fair
catch at the l2 and the Panthers had
7:53 to work with. 7

Pitt then went on a l'7-play drive
that consumed 5:l4 and finished at
the Ohio State 21. Five first downs
were the result of a mixed bag of
plays. Congemi and the Panthers
called on McCall six times during
the series but were unable to get in
the end zone. On a third down and
five from the 2 l , Congemi overthrew
an open Collins in the end zone. The
lone Everett three-pointer put the
Panthers in front until the Tomsc-
zak strike with :39 put the game out
of reach.

“It was a helluva show by two
great football teams," Fazio
remarked with an air of great pride.

ln perhaps the most exciting bowl
game in recent memory, fourth-
ranked Miami of Florida upset No.
1, previously-unbeaten Nebraska
31-30 in the Orange Bowl Monday
night, giving the Hurricanes the
national championship.

It will also be remembered for one
play. After reserve tailback Jeff
Smith ran 24 yards for a touchdown
on a fourth and eight play, Nebraska
coach Tom Osborne refused to go
for a tie and went for the two-point

conversion. The pass from quarter-
:back Turner Gill to Smith was
deflected by Miami cornerback
Kenny Calhoun.

Miami came out quickly, taking a
l7-0 lead in the first quarter on two
touchdown passes from freshman
quarterback Bernie Kosar to tight
end Doug Dennison and a 45-yard
field goal by Jeff Davis. However,
the Cornhuskers, who averaged 52
points a game this season, came
back on a trick play.

Outland and Lombardi trophy
winner Dean Steinkuhler picked up
a intentional fumble by Gill and
rambled 19 yards for the first

Miami storms to
championship

Nebraska touchdown. A Gill one-
yard quarterback sneak cut the lead
to l7-l4. Nebraska turned Miami's
Keith Griffin fumble on the first play
in the second half into a Scott Liv-
ingston. 34-yard field goal, which
tied the game in the third quarter.
The Hurricanes regained momen-
tum as touchdown runs by Alonzo
Highsmith and Albert Bentley gave
Miami a two-touchdown cushion
going into the fourth quarter.
Kosar completed l9 of 30 passes
for an Orange Bowl record 300
yards, while counterpart Gill hit l6
for 30 for 172. Heisman Trophy

«winner Mike Rozier gained 154

yards but was sidelined in the fourth
quarter with an ankle injury.

A loss by second-ranked Texas
and an unimpressive victory by
Auburn set up Miami’s ascension to
the No. 1 spot. A l7-yard run by
Georgia quarterback John Lastin-
ger gave the Bulldogs a I0-9 win over
the Longhorns in the Cotton Bowl,
while Auburn needed an Al Del
Grecco 19-yard field goal with 23
seconds left to edge Michigan 9-7 in
the Sugar Bowl.

Satisfaction

Despite 8-3-1 record, Panter seniorsgo out instyle

By Charlie O'Hara
The Pitt News

TEMPE, Ariz. —— For the seniors
of the Pitt football team, the
achievements accomplished over
their final season are not likely to
stand out as a national champion-
ship or Top l0 ranking would.

This close-knit group of players
proved to be many of the answers in
a season that began with so many
question marks.

With experience backing them
and the Pitt tradition deeply
ingrained within them, these players
-— Tom Flynn, Jim Sweeney, Bill
Maas, Troy Hill, Alan Wengli-
kowski, Joe McCall, Tony Mag-
nelli, Ray Weatherspoon and
Dwight Collins —- fortified the new
stars —- John Congemi, Troy Ben-
son, Caesar Aldisert, Bill Wallace
and Melvin Dean to name a few -
with leadership and confidence.

During the course of the last four

years, Panther teams have compiled.

a 39~8-I record. These seniors have
been through many changes since
choosing this football program.

As freshmen, they were members
of the pre-season No. 1 team that
finished second in the nation behind
Georgia. As sophomores, they sur-
prised everyone as the team carried a
No. I ranking into the final game of
the regular season and finished No.
2. As juniors, they struggled through
a 9-3 season and were supposed to be
disappointed with only a Top I0
ranking‘. .

As seniors, the task was much dif-
ferent. They didn't begin the season
with a proven team. Supposedly, the
Panthers had no quarterback.

When the preseason polls came
out, they all had at least one thing in
common —— the absense of Pitt.

It was a challenge, especially for
the seniors who have always been
able to count on stars like Dan
Marino or Hugh Green.

This time, they had to be the stars.

Well, come through they did. 8-3-
I mav not be the most imposing of
final marks by Pitt teams, but it is
certainly one ofthe most gratifying.

“This was the best of my four
years," Flynn, who has started at
free safety since his freshman year,
said. “This was a great year. We
accomplished a helluva lot. I just
hope I gave to these guys what they
have given to me. I learned a lot
about leadership this year. It was a
great experience.”

Wenglikowski mentioned that
sore which was opened many times
during the I983 season — Playboy’s
pre-season prediction of the Panth-
ers’ finishing under .500, a mark a
Pitt team has not seen in over 10
years.

“People picked us to go‘-4-7,” he
said. “We had a very successful sea-
son. I think this year is gonna have
quite an effect on next year’s team."

When Wenglikowski was asked
about next year’s Pitt team, he said
jokingly, “They’1l probably go about
4-7.”

“I think everybody on the team
was tired of hearing how Pitt doesn't
play tough football," Collins said.
“When you're up against Pitt, you
have to play. We play ﬁne football.
We showed the entire country that
we can play outstanding football.
Ohio State knows that they are very
fortunate to have won this game.”

In many ways, the true success of
this team was its display of maturity
in a pressure-ﬁlled situation. These
team members never quit on
themselves.

“This game was like our season in
some ways,” Sweeney said. “In the

first half, we had to feel them out, see
what they were gonna do. When we
found out what they wanted to do, it
was a matter of taking advantage.

We played a great game. Only two
plays beat us, the kick return and the
pass at the end of the game."

The most rewarding aspect of the
1983 experience for the seniors is the
reaction and dedication of the
younger players.

“There’s no doubt in my mind that
the seniors were the keys,“ junior
inside linebacker and the team‘s

leading tackler Benson said. “I want
to say thanks to the seniors. They
reinstated the Pitt tradition for us.
Now it’s up to us next year to carry
on the tradition.”

This group of Panthers can only
go out with their heads held high.

. Revolution

Changes in horizon at NCAA

By Mark A. Slndler
The Pitt News

_,_.. 4.

The traditional legislative pre-
cepts by which the National Colle-
giate Athletic Association (NCAA)
has governed itself may well become
victim ofa revolution when the body
meets January 9—l l for its annual
convention in Dallas.

The NCAA Council, longa maker
of policies and bylaws and go-
between for institutions seeking sim-
iliar initiatives, will be severely
challenged in authority or given
broader powers if one of three cur-
rent proposals is adopted at the
convention.

“This is fundamental to the gover-
nance of the entire organization.
[NCAA] and, ultimately, is the most
important issue,” Pitt athletic direc-
tor Edward Bozik said of possible
changes in the policy-making pro-
cess, which is similar to that used in
the U.S. Congress.

Forty-six university and college
presidents from the four divisions in
the NCAA compose the council.
Through it, various legislation is
proposed throughout the year for
approval at the annual meeting
every January.

Athletic directors and other uni-
versity representatives are sent com-
pilations of those recommendations
sometime in November, affording
each school enough time to vote in
its best interests. Legislation can

also be initiated by any school
through the NCAA Council, pro-
vided at least five other schools
sponsor the legislation.

No matter who backs the legisla-
tion, ratification can occur only dur-
ing annual conventions, when all
NCAA schools are represented and
can vote or ask for further review.

This could change next week. The
American Council on Education
(ACE), the Select Committee on
Athletic Problems and Concerns in
Higher Education and the NCAA
Council will present recommenda-
tions to the convention that the basic
tenets of law-making be revised or
forgone.

The ACE wants to establish a

A body of university presidents who

would be given legislative initiative
during convention interims, “which
is really not the definition of legisla-
tion initiative,” Bozik said.

The select committee, appointed
by the council 18 months ago to
study such issues as freshman eligi-
bility and internal finances, arrived
at conclusions similar to those
reached by the ACE. The l7-
member committee urged more par-

ticipation by top—level administra-.

tors in NCAA matters, one facet
that chancellors and others often
leave to athletic departments.

The NCAA council is pushing to
appoint a Presidents Commission
that would have the authority to
review any activity of the
association.

“It would place any matter ofcon-
cern on the agenda of any meeting of
the council or the convention,”
Bozik said.

“Commission studies of intercol-

legiate athletics issue and urge cer- '

tain courses of action, proposed
legislation directly to the NCAA
convention. establish a final
sequence of legislative proposals in
any convention rules of order and
call for a special convention of the
association.”

All three proposals drew the ire of
Bozik. who was ofthe opinion that if
one is accepted, then a select group
of people would legislate bylaws
binding for all NCAA schools. None
of the proposals would permit its
members to have the final word on
any legislation piece. But if.there is
not a two-thirds majority ofthe con-
vention to overrule any such legisla-
tion, then it becomes NCAA law.

“If you’re a political scientist, you
say it’s pretty bad politics," Bozik
said. “The other one [ACES] is veto
authority over any action ofthe con-
vention on matters dealing with
finance, academics and integrity,
which pretty much covers a lot of
ground.”

Of the NCAA Council’s version,
Bozik said: “There has been the criti-
cism of the NCAA hierarchy that
they set the agenda —— the bureau-
cracy does —- and the council stamps
its approval on it. And here the pres-
idents would be doing that. It would
be a 44—man commission, Very much
a mirror of the council, but would
not have the veto authority.”
