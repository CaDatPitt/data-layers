Over twenty-seven per cent of
all. male students at Pitt, or 535
out of. 1,909 eligibles, are engaged
in military‘ work, according_ to Maé
jor Lloyd P. Horsfall, head of the
military department.

"The number of R. O. T. C. eli-
gibles‘ in the freshman and sopho-
more classes totals 1,—639. Of this
number, 326 ortwent per cent are
registered in the bas course of R.
T. C. In the advanced-course,
209 men or sixty per cent of the
280, eligibles are re 7stered. This
is an ‘unusual rocor , accordin to
Major Horsfall, since men mm
the law, pharmacy, dental, and
downtown schools are ineligible be-
cause of conﬂicting schedules. A

Since government dispensation
provides for. only 500 men in the
Pitt unit, special permission. had to
be secured. this-- year to take care‘
of overregistration, states Major
Horsfall. ‘

New Chemistry Course
‘Oﬁered Next Semester

Methods used for the determina-

rranici substances will be offered by
anew course in quantitative organic
microanalysis next semester. Dr.
Ralph T. K. Cornwell, recently added
to the staff of instruction, who is
Vin charge of the new» course, in-
cludes in his program the determina-
tion of such elements as carbon,
hydrogen, sulphur, halogens and
metals. A

Dr. Cornwall, in explaining what
is meant by a minute particle, said,
“Before the new me“~~‘S were de-
veloped, it was practically impossi-
ble to obtain reliable analytical data
unless fro" 0.5 to 1.0 gram of the
material was available. Now one
can determine :v-~"~‘*'* ly the amount
of each element present in an or-

PICTURE BOOKS

By Olga Sekey

On Sundays, only upper classmen
who have gone to Sunday School
and who have clean hands may look
at the new books which the Fine
Arts department library has re-
ceived. It is not necessary that the
students be extraordinarily intel-
lectual, for the books contain mostly
pictures. For their use, there is -a
catalogue of the collection of George
and Florence Blumenthal in four
volumes on paintings, sculpture,
bronzes, works of art and tapestries
and furniture during the Renais-
sance and. medieval times.‘ These
books were privately printed and
presented as gifts to the library.

Two majolica vases are pictured
inrthe volume on works of art. One
vase is elevated to a -place in a
drawing’ room by the aristocratic
simper on the nose of‘ a young
woman on it. The other should be
relegated to a tavern by 3_1i'ler1‘Y old
gentleman. «His eye browsrindicate

   

{moral dVeVg¢neracy.. by their 

  

shapeand his eyes say “Fill ’er up,
for I must drink to be merry."

,In a Flemish pastoral scene. on
tapestry there is no sense of per-
spectiveor gravity, but considering
the fact that Sir Isaac Newton had
not yet discovered gravity, the pic-
ture may be exempt from technical
requirements. In one corner, two
people are illustrating the correct
attitude for holding hands. They
show that feeling is conveyed much
better when the ﬁngertips are not
smothered by another person’S whole
hand. In place of the usual cupids,
lambs are ﬂoating about.

Then as a bedtime story, the well-
behaved ipper classmen may look at
Rene D’anjou: Livre du Cuer Da-
mours Espris, for as wasisaid be-
fore, the pictures, fully convey the
meaning, Quite appropriately also,

committee revising the evaluation
of extra-curricular activities‘ will be
presented to the point-scale com-

The special committee; following
several weeks of deliberation, has
completed a revised set of evalua-
tions governing student participa-
tion in extra-curricular "activities.
The conditions which Occasion the
change were brought about by the
concentration of extra-curricular
activities in a small‘ number of in-
dividuals making necessary neglect
to a certain extent of the studies
of those individuals, says C. R. Wil-

  TRACKPRACTICE,

4__.._.

FOR TOMORROWII

S?  The ﬁrst call for track and ﬁeld
(men has been sounded by Coach
, I-Frank Shea, who will gather his var-
.,sity and fresh cindermen at the» in-
idoor track tomorrow .afternoon.fi;om

 I 8. to 5:30 o'clock. Shea wants fthe

A new men to report to him at‘ this
. particular time as he intends to de-

I‘ vote the first few weeks primarily
to the rookies. . I r ‘ _ I’

, Shea intimates that-fa‘-"rn-a‘n. who
has any ability at‘ all will be used
if he turns out to these-practice

. 1 ‘sessions regularlyg Inexperience is

 , the only excuse in track athletics,

~

  and a man who has the natural abil-‘ d

. . ity can develop into a fair track
 man with a good month’s prelimi-
,,  nary training. .
” A The track coach is anxious to have
.a'”s. many men out for. the track
I , squad as is possible, for he thinks
_t “that the football and basketball
." teams have been blazing trails that
.9 the Golden Panther cindermen must
Iwrtduplicate. In fact, Shea thinks that
 this present track team will eclipse
‘7 3 the records of any previous one in
 j the university.
_ The material that Frank Shea has
.. to pick from is the best in many
seasons. In thesprints there are:
Bo,Wen, M‘cCullough,,G,oldstein, Long,
.Costello and Wibecan; ' .quar-t_er-mile:
