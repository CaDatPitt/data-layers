Battle Continues

By MARTY WILLIS

Officials at majorresearch institu-
tions such as Pitt have grown con-
cerned over recent lobbying efforts
conducted by a handful of American
universities to obtain federal
research grants.

Research administrators at Pitt
and Carnegie-Mellon University.
however, said they are not alarmed
by the lobbying attempts and do not
expect a trend to develop in which
grants would be awarded without
first allowing scientists to review the
merits of research proposals.

“Lobbying has always happened.
but has not been extremely success-
ful. My personal feeling, and We
been a research administrator for
many years, is that it‘s pretty much

i the same now as it has always been,"

said CMU Provost Angel Jordan.

“I don't really think it‘s of epi-
demic proportions, but I do think
it‘s something that should be
addressed so that it won't become a
large-scale problem....There are a
couple of universities who have had
their pet projects written into the
legislation recently. Here at Pitt. we
don’t do that, in terms of trying to
circumvent the peer review process,”
said Lou Trunzo, assistant vice-
chancellor for public affairs.

The peer review system is an
American research tradition which
allows all universities to submit spe-

Sheetz Awaits Liquor

By JOE zerr

The president of Sheetz Conven-
ience Stores lnc. said Monday that
his Oakland store has obtained a
beer license, despite the opposition
of a local community group.

Charles Sheetz said he expects
written notification from the Penn-
sylvania Liquor Control Board later
in the week on the license for
Wichita Willie's, a beer and sand-
wich shop to be opened in the base-
ment of the store inlate April, i984.

Sandra Phillips, director of Oak-
land Directions lnc. (ODI), said the
addition of another drinking estab-
lishment in Oakland is a problem.
ODl is an active community group

that helps shape decisions facing the
area.

“We have a general policy of being
opposed to having more liquor
licenses in Oakland, especially in the
fast-food chains," Phillips said,
emphasizing that should a business
close, the next owner would control
the license.

“We feel that Sheetz is a fine cor-

' poration and a good business asset

to Oakland," Phillips said, “but
should. they not make it, should they
decide that they don't want to con-
tinue with it, anyone could take over
the license, and we‘d have no control
over it.”

The license does not permit the
establishment to sell hard liquor,

only beer. The community group is
frightened by the number of malt
liquor licenses already in the Oak-
land area.

“There are a number of prob-
lems,” Phillips said. “Often people
are afraid to come into Oakland at
night because of the rowdy atmo-
sphere. We feel that the area is
already saturated with too many
bars.”

ODl‘s public safety committee
expressed concern at an August 30
meeting with Sheetz over the base-
ment location of the sandwich shop.

Plans call for entrances on each
side of the store, located at the
corner of Forbes and Oakland
Avenues, with the main entrance

cific proposals to specific federal
agencies such as the National
Science Foundation and the
National Institutes of Health -— but
not directly to Congress. Each pro-
posal is evaluated on its scientific
merit before grants are awarded.

“Marks are given to the proposals
just like grading in an exam. The
highest-graded proposals are
funded. Now, some proposals have
been rated quite high but there isn't
enough money for them," said Leo-
nard Kuntz, Pitt deputy associate
provost of research.

Such controversy arose in aca-
demic circles last spring when offi-
cials at Columbia and Catholic
Universities hired a Washington,
D.C. consulting firm to lobby for
their proposals in Congress. bypass-
ing the traditional application and
review process.

This approach was not unprece-
dented. However, officials at other
schools were upset that money
approved for those two universities
was taken from the budgets of other
projects that had already undergone
scholarly review, according to a
Nov. 2 article in Science Magazine.

in response, the Association of
American Universities (of which
both Pitt and CMU are members),
the National Academy of Sciences,
and the American Physical Society
all released statements within the
last month urging universities and

“The meeting was worthwhile,“
Sheetz said. “They protested, and we
sat down with them and discussed

, safety features. When I reassured

them that everything was under
OSHA standards, they were
satisfied.” '

Jay Roling, chairman of the OD]
Public Safety Committee and an
assistant to the vice-chancellor at
Pitt is not satisfied either. He has not
yet been convinced that Sheetz‘s
building plans adhere to the city’s
zoning and building codes.

“He showed us drawings, not
sketches, no signatures. He‘ also

Mr.‘Sheetz satisfied himself. Their
plans call for a sandwich shop in
their basement, underneath the con-

Congress not to bypass the peer
review system by permitting funding
decisions to be made on the basis of
personal or political inﬂuence.
“People are starting to complain
so that Congress won't go off on that
deep end. They want to make sure it
does not become a practice. 1 would

have to support that. We as a univer- V

sity have to support the peer review
process,” said John Thompson,
director of sponsored project
administration.

“I don't want to be naive enough
to think that [lobbying] won’t
happen again. I think it‘s an oddity
rather than a trend, but I’m sure that
if somebody yells loud enough, so to
speak, it would tend to keep this
practice down,“ he added.

About 2,200 separate requests for
federal grants passed through Pitt‘s

Office of Reseaich in I982, and

about 650 of them received funding,
Kuntz said, adding that he expects
similar totals for I983.

"We get our funding through the
peer reveiw system. [it‘s] the only
fair system. Let‘s stay with the sys-
tem that gives .an objective,
iiiformed opinion of the scientific
and scholarly merits of specific

proposals," Kuntz said. 

“I'd like to think these [lobbying
incidents] are exceptions, and I'd
like to think there's been a sufficient
outcry that the peer review system

The future relationships
between people and computers
should include a pleasurable and
relaxing, as well as efficient,
environment said Dr. Myron
Krueger.

Krueger, a professor of com-
puter science at the University of

V Connecticut. was the keynote

speaker at yesterday's Computer
Fair ‘83 held in Forbes Quadran-
gle through tomorrow.

“Since computers are becom-
ing such a big part of our lives,
they should be pleasurable to
use." Said Krueger.

One of the techniques that
makes computers more pleasura-
ble to use is the “Fortune Cookie

Program.” This program has the

Exposing Computers’ Lighter Side

computer display a little quote or
saying, such as the ones found in
fortune cookies, to the user each
time he logs in or has to wait a
while for the computer to process
information.

This program has the
computer display a lit-
tle quote or saying,
such as ones found in
fortune cookies.

Another area that will create a
better interaction between peo-
ple and computers is a computer
generated “Artificial Reality."
The computer portrays as artifi-
cial world on a screen in which
the user becomes a character in

that world. The “Artificial Real-
ity" enviroment could do things
such as teach children about out-
erspace, Krueger said. The com-
puter would display images of
the planets and the stars for the
child to explore for himself.

The “Artificial Reality“ envi-
ronment could also explain con-
cepts such as “lifting" to
children. The computer could
portray the Sesame Street Char-
acter Big Bird lifting an object to
illustrate the world.

Krueger’s original intent was
to find better ways for computers
to teach people how to use com-
puters. This idea was expanded
to the actual world of people-
computer interaction. Most of
his research takes place at where
he creates the computer gener-
ated environment.

As Mark Downs wraps up his
term of office, he has only one
request.

“Can I put in a paid advertisement
for dates?" he asked.

With no previous experience on
the board, he pulled an underdog
victory for the position last year and
was suddenly thrust into a fast-
paced life with a_ very full schedule.

“It's given me a lot less personal
time to listen to music or read or talk
with friends," he said.

Rushing around to meetings and
luncheons and putting in one or two
office hours every day has helped
prepare him for after he graduates in
April.

“It‘s been a realistic experience
because the farther‘)/ou get along in
life, the busier you get."

One of the major issues of the
term, he said, was the appointment
by the administration ofthe student
trustee, which the student govern-
ment considered invalid because
they were not informed of it and had
no input in the renomination
process.

The Student Government
response was an angry letter to The
Pitt News calling for the nomination
.to be invalidated.

“We more or less got involved in
the emotional part of that matter
and then showed our emotions and

temper to the University." Downs
said. "We really should have
informed the students what was
going on and maybe got the students
more involved in it. We learned that
it takes a steady flow to get some-
thing done. “

I One issue Downs thinks the board
handled well was the closing of the
full-time Internship Office by the
University. The SGB waged an all-
out campaign among the students,
in the way of letter-writing and peti-
tions, calling for the re-opening of
the Office.

“In the past I don't think the stu-
dent government has taken that sort
of a stand," he said. “Our board
showed a little more flexibility in
student government than has been
shown in the past.“

One of the problems within the
board, according to Downs, was a
failure to communicate among
board members.

“Communication is a problem in
any organization," he said. “If an
organization can have 90 percent
effective communication, they’re
doing a really good job. There were
times when we as board members
had commitments where there were
mix-ups in times of meetings.”

An economics/business major,
his short-term career goal is to get
into a company with a solid training
program. Being president ofthe Stu-
dent Government Board has helped

 Downs Reflects On 8 G B Te rm ,

him achieve this goal by sharpening
his "people skills.“

“You go into meetings and talk
with people all the time. When I
started I was quiet, and when I went
into meetings I didn‘t speak a lot,“
he said. “Now I’m confident about
speaking out. That’s what any stu-
dent organization does, builds your
confidence."

Being verbal at meetings is some-
thing president-elect Ken Stram will
have to learn, Downs said.

“People speak to the Student
Government Board president as the
person who‘s representing the whole
student body. Ken’s going to be
asked to speak when he won‘t expect
to be asked to speak.“

Stram’s experience as a board
member will help him as president
because he’s already familiar with
"the system,” he said.

“Whether you’re getting hired for
a job or involved in an activity or a
freshman coming to school, your
experience is based on the people
you meet and interact with.

“People will do something for you
only if you can motivate them to do
it or show that you’re worthy of
doing something for."

More words of wisdom for Stram
will surely include those passed
down to him from Downs‘predeces-
sor, Todd DeLuca: “Make time for
yourself. You have to take the time
and do some things you want to do
so you don’t go crazy.”

The U.S. Navy is offering stu-
dents an opportunity to explore
the nuclear navy through a scho-
larship available to officer
candidates.

Lt. William Charuk, a 1977
graduate of Pennsylvania State
University and a current
recruiter, advises applicants for
the Navy Nuclear Propulsion
Officer Candidate Scholarship.

Lt. Charuk said the term
“nuclear navy” refers to nuclear-
powered ships and submarines.

“The advantage to the nuclear-

powered ‘ ships and subs is that
they don’t have to be refueled for
years,” Charuk said. “One that I
was on didn’t have to be refueled
for I3 years."

Charuk said nuclear fueling is
beneficial, especially during a
conflict, because subs can remain

submerged ~ and therefore
undetected — as they do not
have to resurface as often for
fueling.

Students wishing to be consi-
dered must be working on or
have completed a bachelor of
science degree» in engineering,
math, physics or chemistry with

Nuclear Navy Offers Scholarship

a minimum of one year of calcu-
lus and physics.

Once accepted, the applicant
first attends officer candidate
school in Newport, R.I., and
then Nuclear Power School in
Orlando, Fla.

Lt. Lorric Rezendes, the Penn-
sylvania district recruiter, said
that the skills aquired during the
four years of training become
highly marketable in civilian life.

“We aren’t trying to recruit
people for naval careers,"
Rezendes said. “That is entirely
up to the individual.”

Since its publication in I950,
George Orwell’s “l984“ has stirred a
lot of controversy and speculation
about what the world would be like
in that year. Thirty-four years have
passed since “I984“ attracted world
attention. and the title year is almost
here.

If we are on the brink ofan Orwel-
lian I984, this will be one of the last
newspaper articles to escape rewrite
to conform to the ideologies of a
select few who have the power to
control society en masse.

When government turns its power
into control. its people are living in
an Orwellian society. Many inter-
pret “l984“ as a. warning of dehu-
manization of the masses by the
government or “Party."

In OrweIl’s book, life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness are not
valued by the Party. The Ministry of
Love does its best to insure that pur-
suing love isjust as good as pursuing
death.

Although some say we are dehu-
manized by social security and other
identification numbers, our society
is far from succumbing to a “I984"-
like system, and our government is
far from implementing one.

An example of this is the recent
telecast of “The Day After.”a movie
that appealed to the human instincts
of the American public and opposed

Our government has the ability to
intrude into our homes — even now,
before I984 — and become every
citizen's Big Brother. In fact, the FBI
and CIA have been accused ofdoing
it already.

Our government also has the tech-
nology to manufacture phones with
screens for our homes so the person
to whom we're speaking can see us.
It also has the power to keep us all
on files and lists and record how
much money we make.

cratic state. so even if the arms race
doesn't lead to war. Orwell infers
that it will lead to totalitarianism.

The panel of experts who
appeared after “The Day After"
presented the possibility that we
may be faced with the choice of con-
tinuing to arm ourselves or becom-
ing a totalitarian society —- fighting
for our beliefs with nuclear weapons
or giving in to a country that would
not propagate our value of freedom.

Surely Orwell would agree that
the end result of either choice would
be terrible. Perhaps that's why his
original title for “I984" was “The
Last Man in Europe."

Legal
Questions

Victims of sexual abuse lost a battle in the courts
recently in Pittsburgh, and if its implications are not
realized immediately, it could start a horrifying trend.

A North Side man was acquitted of molesting his
four-year-old granddaughter by Senior Common
Pleas Court Judge J. Quint Salmon from Beaver

County. The trial was non-jury.

The question of the man’s acquittal does not center
around whether or not he was innocent or guilty but,
rather, if molestation charges should be handled in

_ criminal courts at all.

Salmon said they should not be handled by the law
and that cases involving incest would best be handled
by family members. “It’s not like we’re talking about
some stranger holding a knife or gun on you and
holding you up. If it happened in your family,
wouldn’t you talk about it?” Salmon asked.

Salmon said the idea that family members who are
faced with an incestous problem do not know how to

, handle it amongst themselves is nonsense.

It is quite evident from his remarks that he needs a

basic course in law —— or maybe in humanity and

decency.

According to an article in Sunday’s Pittsburgh
Press, Salmon’s handling of the case involving the
four-year-old has prompted officials in District Attor-
ney Bob Colville’s office to consider avoiding the
courtroom when they have a case of incest.

This is a terrifying consideration. Victims of incest
are usually young, innocent child-ren who trust and
respect their abusers. For years, rape counseling cen-
ters and other law officials have been trying to bring
the child abusers to court and punish them within the

confines of the law.

In most cases, it is difficult for a child to admit he
had been abused by a member of his family. This is an
exceedingly difficult problem to handle solely within

the family.

Child molestation is no different from rape; the
abuse is forced upon the child, who often is too young

to know what is happening.

Many rape victims feel as if they are responsible for
thecrime committed against them; they feel that they
provoked the action in some way. If crimes of incest
were not reported and the abuser not prosecuted, the
same thing could happen to those victims. It’s proba-

ble that it already does.

Judge Salmon’s comments are inhumane; the judi-
cial systems ofthis city and this country ‘need to look at
his remarks seriously. The judicial system is meant to
protect the victims, not hurt them.

America’s children are America’s future, and they
should not be ruined by a person of Salmon’s stature.

Remembering How Far We Have Come

By TODD ERKEL

Few things have fallen out of the
American public’s favor as much as
this country’s labor movement.
Labor unions have never before met
with the type of widespread betrayal
and ill-feeling that has been exhi-
bited in the past few years.

The most recent outbreak of anti-
union sentiment has been cast upon
the members of the Amalgamated
Transit Union who for years have
done the driving for us — the Grey-
hound workers. If news accounts of
the strike against Greyhound have
yet to reach you, the aftermath ofthe
walkout may have.

A glance at any major newspaper
in this country, including the two
major Pittsburgh dailies, will reveal
quarter-page and full-page adver-
tisjernents pleading the woes of one
of this country’s most stable and
affluent corporations, as well a call
for replacements for those strikers
walking the pavement.

Blind acceptance of these claims
might be rationalized by other peo-
ple in other American cities, but not
by the supposedly labor-born and
union-bred Pittsburgher. But they
have.

Greyhound, Inc. has seemingly
substituted the practice of bargain-
ing in good faith with the more con-
temporary tactic of “when the
worker breaks, the union will fall.”
Given the Reaganistic mood of the
country, and the make-up of the
National Labor Relations Board,
that process of union-bending could
continue on indefinitely without fear
of any public outcry or administra-
tive action.

The Reagan approach to Ameri-
can labor best expressed itself in the
strike by the air traffic controllers in
the early days of his administration.
Defense for an illegal strike is not the
critical point here; rather, the ques-
tion of whether any ofthe conditions
that motivated such an action have
been corrected. Congress has been
besieged by legislation aimed at cor-
recting the very problems that Rea-
gan chose to ignore in favor of
higher and dryer grounds, _upon
which he pontificated that illegal
strikes cut at the core of what makes
America great.

Strikes can occur for a variety of
reasons. some of which are justified
more easily than others, but the cur-
rent climate doesn‘t allow for
debate. To strike is to stumble out

. onto the street, mouths foaming
' with greed. To strike is to inconven-

ience an American public that has
grown accustomed to convenience.
regardless of its cost.

The public assumption that labor

stares blindly into the face of irony.
Americans sit before their television
sets admiring Polish workers prac-
ticing the very doctrine of the
worker that we have come to dis-
dain. Their heroic sacrifices have
somehow become our senseless
violence. .
Greyhound, Inc. refused the
union’s request to extend the current
contract while negotiations con-
tinued. The company wants its
employees to give back nearly one-

Such resolve and solidarity — to
coin a phrase ——’has met with no
outward public support.

The American working and mid-
dle classes have grown comfortable
in their standard ofliving, seemingly
without regard to how that standard
was obtained. Unfortunately, it may
take a violent reminder of what
American labor has suffered
throughio remind us all from where
our bounty has come.

I

fourth of all the wages and benefits
obtained by the union over the
years. The company defends the
request, arguing that the cuts are
needed to preserve their competitive
place in the transportation business.

What the company fails to explain
is that the very bus company upon
which this enormous corporation
grew now only represents I3 percent
of its holdings.

The anti-union rhetoric has snow-
balled, taking with it every auto and
steel worker in its path. Now the
Greyhound employees find them-
selves under similar attack. A recent
vote by the union members over-
whelmingly turned down the latest
contract by a ‘no’ vote of 96 percent.

Pro-Lifers Use ‘Slide Argument’

Dear Editor:

Joseph Armata‘s letter in Mon-
day’s issue revives the Right-to-Life
movement’s favorite “slide argu-
ment.” A slide argument states that
ifyou let one awful thing happen, it
will lead to all kinds of others -
specifically, that if we allow abor-
tion, it will lead to infanticide and
geronticide.

It might be better to argue each
issue on its own merits. Many socie-
ties permit one such phenomenon
and not others. Classical Rome, for
example, allowed abortion and
infanticide but never permitted ge-
ronticide. A father under Roman
law could kill his son with impunity,
but a son would not dare kill his
father. This state of affairs lasted for
about 1,200 years. A similar situa-
tion existed in Imperial China for
over 6,000 years. Societies can also
be cited which kill the elderly but not
infants (e.g., some Eskimo groups).

Possible vagueness in deﬁnitions
is no reason to give up trying to
define things. We need to delimit
what is and is not human; clearly it is
OK to kill mosquitoes and wrong to

kill citizens. Societies that treat all
life as equally worthwhile can end up
passive to the point of caricature

’lIndia’s Jains, for example, wear
cloth over their mouths and noses to
avoid breathing in insects and are
very careful when they walk). On
abortion, I think birth (whenever it
takes place) is a perfectly good func-
tional definition for when a separate
personality is present. First con-
sciousness is a clear dividing line; a
better one, in fact, than the Right-to-
Lifers’ favorite of conception (why
not implantation? Or, since some
rare women may be parthenoge-
netic, oogenesis?)

Slide arguments occur on all sides
of the political spectrum. For exam-
ple, liberals opposed to capital pun-
ishment sometimes argue that
executions for one crime will lead to
executions for everything. I am
against capital punishment myself,
but I know damn well that societies
have existed for millenia with some
crimes considered capital and others
not so. Slide arguments are an
underhanded attempt to enlist sup-
port out of fear. Right-to—Lifers

would like to recruit the elderly by
making them think they could be
subjects of an extermination cam-
paign. Penal reformers try to put
their audience in the place of some-
one sentenced to death. Neither tac-
tic is intellectually honest.

One last comment. As an Ameri-
can of Jewish background, I am
tired of hearing abortion equated
with the Holocaust. The latter was
an attempt to wipe out every
member of an ethnic group. No one
is claiming that the unborn run the
banks or were behind the Versailles
Treaty, yet these comparisons keep
coming up. For the record, Hitler
wanted to “destroy the foolish
notion that a woman’s body is her
own to control. National Socialist
principles demand that the practice
of abortion be exterminated with a
firm hand.” Abortion was illegal in
Nazi Germany, and it was banned in
Stalin's Russia from I937 until after
his death.

NCAA Stabbing Itself, In The Back?

By MARK A. SINDLER

They didn't waste any time or
space in coming right out and saying
it: “The question of freshman eligi-
bility is complex.”

Straight from the report of The
Select Committee on Athletic Prob-
lems and Concerns in Higher Educa-
tion, l7 appointed members delve
into what they see as a
educationally-inhibiting force in
Division I schools today: freshmen
participating in basketball and foot-
ball.

These 17 people have been study-
ing this, as well as other current
issues of concern, for the past 16
months — as appointed to do so by
the NCAA Council — so it appears
obvious that something nearing a
significant breakthrough might
come of it. Don’t be so easily fooled.

It’s not that there were no
unanimous proposals reached or
that the council itself said it would
not support the committee’s recom-
mendations at the NCAA’s annual
convention in January, but why
would anyone or any body of
“authorities on the subject" demand
research be done into this void called
freshman eligibility.

In issuing its report, the commit-
tee failed to use academic data from
one university or a group of schools

to point out a failing in our higher
educational segment of society.
There is no basis for investigation
into the matter except for a hollow
statement about a student-athlete
“entering into into that difficult
transition with a massive, immediate
commitment to athletics...leave[ing]
inadequate time for study and accul-
turation...condemn[ing] all but the
best and most dedicated students to
the likelihood of probation and even
failure.” t

It must hurt because the NCAA is
actually stabbing itself in the back
here. By marketing Division I foot-
ball and basketball, high-intensity
sports by right, to the utmost,
today’s NCAA actually brings prob-
lems. to not only freshmen but
student-athletes, period.

The contention here is not that
showcasing football and basketball
on TV should be ended or banned.
In fact, both are enjoyable entertain-
ment alternatives; the National Bas-
ketball Association a far second to
the college version.

But by combining the consequen-
ces of appearing on the tube as well
as before a massive print media,
from the local hometown guys to the
national scripture authors, the
immense pressures on athletes to
perform to pre-season and concur-
rent expectations are incalculable.
The solution is as difficult to come

by as outlining an alternative to
freshman eligibility.

That’s not good enough for the
NCAA. It has to instead stick its
head into something to which it
should say, “Well, that'sjust the way
it is.” Today's Division I outposts
are training grounds for the future
hopefuls of pro ball, though the
actual number making it may be
small.

No one university administrator
comes forward, but it is general
knowledge that many of today's bas-
ketball and football players are in
school to further their dreams of
playing in the pros. Note the
“many.” It isn’t a slam on anybody.
That’s just the way it is.

Impossible, the philosophy goes,
does not exist in the vocabulary. It
should in the NCAA bylaws. For the
hours mounted upon hours, the
mental concentration necessary to
succeed and make the team function
work and to fulfill unlimited desires
to “do good,” today’s student-
athletes cannot even hope to excel
on the court or field as well as in the
classroom.

Obviously some do. Exceptions
always apply to the rule.

Hopefully the NCAA will soon
realize this and put its efforts to bet-
ter use. Valuable time has melted
away from the eligibility candle the
last I6 months.

Alternate Views

(Editor's note: On Tuesday.
Nov. 8, 37 members of the Pro-
gressive Student Network at the
University of Michigan seized
control of a research laboratory,
vowing to shut down military
research being conducted on
campus. Members of the PSN
came under fire from various
university administrators and
others. The following is an edi-
torial that was printed in The
Michigan Daily on Nov. I0_fol-
lowing the demonstration.)

University president Harold
Shapiro said yesterday that tak-
ing over a research laboratory IS
an “inappropriate“ action in a
university community. The mes-
sage is not a new one.

It is inappropriate for students
to hold any authority, to exercise
any power at the university: This
seems to be the administration's
bottom line. And as long as they
continue to hold that line, sit-ins,

Students’ Demonstrations Applauded

like the one in Prof. Thomas
Senior’s research laboratory this
week, will be necessary for stu-
dents to have any real voice in
university policy.

It is a long established univer-
sity policy that students don‘t get
a say in decisions, even if those
decisions affect them most. Sure,
students can give as much advice
as they want. They can speak at
public hearings, they can talk at
committee meetings, they can
even meet with administrators.
But there is little guarantee that
anyone will listen, much less take
action as a result.

As long as students have no
formal pull, they will be forced to
exert pressure by working out-
side the system. They have to
change the system byjamming it
and turning up the publicity heat
until it behaves differently.

Students have to harness
power from outside the system to

get a real voice, and this is what
the Progressive Student Net-
work’s sit-in has started to do.

They have succeeded in stir-
ring up a good deal of publicity.
Most of the state papers picked
up the story, as well as at least
one national radio station. And
through this publicity, PSN has
rallied a small amount of campus
support, at least enough to keep
the military research issue smol-
dering, if not burning.

Perhaps this demonstration
will have some small effect on the
university’s attitude toward
questionable projects such as
Prof. Senior’s. In all likelihood,
however, it will not unless debate
continues after the event is
forgotten.

But at least these students have
made an appropriate statement
— a statement with some punch
toit.

Dear Editor:

I am sick in my heart at the
actions of Senior Common Pleas
Court Judge Salmon and his
treatment of sexual abuse of
children — “lt’s not like some
stranger holding a knife on you."
No, it is so much worse.

A four-year-old child must
trust and depend on adults, and
especially family, for love and
care. The scarring of being mo-
lested as a child never goes away.
Regardless of the judge’s find-
ings, his conduct in berating the
four-year-old, calling incest
“common, ordinary things
among adults" and his remarks
to the jury in the fourteen-year-
old’s trial show unbelievably that
to Mr. Salmon, incest is not a
crime but just something to be
worked out in the family. When
adults have the responsibility
and the privilege to care for an
innocent child, sexual abuse is

n.

Ruling Sickens Reader

the cruelest, most perverse crime
possible.

This family faced the pain and
the stress of bringingthe incident
to court, but then they ran into
Judge Salmon. I doubt now that
they will be able to invest the
great energy and money for an
appeal, but if this ever goes to
trial, no jury in the world would
look the other way when the
accused is a convicted child
molester. We have judges to pro-
tect innocent four-year-olds, and
Mr. Salmon betrayed our trust
by freeing the convicted child
molester. I know he would not be
so detached and arrogant if
someone molested his four-year-
old daughter. Incest is the ulti-
mate betrayal of a little child's
trust. How could such a man be a
judge?

Editorial ArgumentLacks

Logical Conclusions

Dear Editor:

Your editorial, “Ethical Ques-

tions," appearing in the Monday,
Nov. 21 issue of The Pitt News, was
flawed only in that it did not carry its
arguments to their logical conclu-
sion. This is partly because you
failed to address several aspects of
the plight of parents with handi-

’ capped children.

While you “applaud" the courts‘
decisions to uphold the rights of par-
ents of handicapped newborns who
need corrective surgery to survive,
you completely neglect the rights of
parents whose handicapped children
are either healthy or out of the
nursery.

Surely these children can be as
much a burden on their parents as
the others are, Yet the courts are
inconsistent here.

Parents of newborns like Infant
Doe now have the legal option of
withholding both life-saving surgery
and food and water from their chil-
dren in addition to the traditional
options of putting them in state or
private institutions or up for adop-
tion or foster care. Both the Indiana
and the New York courts main-
tained this ruling despite pressure
from numerous couples who wanted
to adopt the handicapped babies.

Illogically enough, such an option
is not. available for parents of older
or healthier handicapped children.

Even if this choice were extended
to all parents, it would still be more
traumatic than it has to be. Watch-
ing one’s child succumb slowly to
starvation and dehydration, as the
Indiana couple did, or to repeated
bouts of infection, as the New York
couple now looks forward to doing,
is an emotionally scarring expe-
rience, even if the child is
handicapped.

We, as a society, do not subject
even hardened criminals or stray
animals to such slow, painful deaths.
Certainly, both the handicapped
and their parents deserve a method
of termination that is faster, less
painful and, since money is always a
major consideration in these cases,
less expensive as well.

Fortunately, we have only to look
to history for this method and for
the final solution to all these “ethical
questions."

In speed, relative painlessness and
low cost, the Germans, a mere 40
years ago, found gas chambers to be
particularly efficient.

Quo Vadis

Training To Tour The World

By TAMARA CHOBANY

Imagine being a tour director
for 18 exotic countries, without
even leaving campus. It’s possi-
ble when you are a member of
Quo Vadis.

Quo Vadis members are
volunteers who give tours of the
Nationality Rooms to about
20,000 visitors to the university
each ' year.
Rooms are located on the first
floor of the Cathedral of Learn-
ing. The volunteers work two
hours a week plus two two-hour
weekends per term.

A program is held each term,
lasting about ten weeks, to train

the new members. The program C

includes learning information on

. the history and art of each of the
countries represented in the
rooms.

t “There is a purpose to learning

about the rooms,” sai_d_sopho-
more Becky Dietrich, “it is some-
thing you want to learn.”

Training also includes how to
deal with special groups, such as
VIPs and handicaps. ‘‘_It takes a
lot of time,” said junior Nancy
Khetowski, “but I wouldn’t have
been in, it for three years if it
wasn’t worth it.”

At the conclusion of training,
each trainee must pass an oral
and written test qualifying him
or her for membership. This year
there are 30 qualified members
and 25 active trainees.

“It takes a very special person
to be in Quo Vadis,” says Chris
Walsh, the advisor of the
program. “

Pitt forward Jennifer Bruce scored 35 points In last nlght’s

83-65 win.

By TIM DINGER

The Pitt wrestling team opens its
1983-84 season against Waynesburg
College today at the Field House.

The Panthers finished last season
with an 8-7 record. head coach
Rande Stottlemyer‘s first winning
season since he took over the helm in
1979. This year could be the best yet.
he recently predicted.

“We have more talent now than
we ever had before.” Stottlemyer
said. “We don‘t have the overall
depth it takes to be a great dual-meet
team. but our front line can compete
with any team we wrestle this year.“

Headlining the Pitt lineup are a
pair of seniors: Jeff Jelic (I67 lbs.)
and Joe Throckmorton (I34 lbs.).

Jelic comes back a two-time East-
ern Wresting League (EWL) Cham-
pion at I58 lbs. and is the defending
Penn State Invitational Champion
at I67 lbs.

In both of his trips to the national
tournament in the past two years,
Jelic missed All-America status by a
single victory. He has also been a
Pitt captain the last two years.

More recently. Jelic posted a 5-0
record enroute to an Eastern
Nationals Championship earlier this
month at Old Dominion. In the

Bruce Paces 83-65 Victory

By SCOTT DELLETT

Jennifer Bruce scored a game-
high 35 points as the Pitt women's
basketball team defeated Young-
stown State 83-65 last night at the
Fitzgerald Field House.

Bruce shot I6 for 24 from the field
as thejunior forward was able to get
the ball inside easily on Young-
stown’s 2-3 zone. something she had
problems with against Indiana last
Saturday.

The key to Bruce's success offen-
sively. however. was the successful
perimeter shooting of guard Kim
Tirik and the inside play by fresh-
man forward Julie Gallan in the first
half along with the perimeter shoot-
ing of forward Ellen Gilhooley in the
second half.

Lady Panther head coach Judy
Saurer was pleased with their per-
formances. hiking the team's record
to 2-I.

“Tirik did a better job setting up
the offense." Saurer said. “She had
more control out there. Callan is a
tough person. She is way ahead of
schedule. Gilhooley hit some key
shots in the second half. She may
become the clutch player we need to
put us on top.“

The one defensive change Saurer
made was the difference in the game.
Instead of going with a I-3-I zone.
the fourth-year coach played pres-
suring man-to-man defense against

finals. he defeated All-America
Kevin Jackson of Louisiana State.
I3-7. Jackson had placed third at
last year's NCAA Tournament.

As a team. Pitt only sent four
wrestlers to compete yet came away
with a fifth place out of 25 teams. V

Throckmorton is a two-time.
third-place finisher at the EWL
Tournament and took third place at
last year's PSU Invitational at a
weight of I34 lbs. c

He missed getting a wild-card
berth to the national tournament by
a single vote from the EWL coaches.

He also captained the team last
year along with Jelic.

At Eastern Nationals. Throck-
morton posted a 5-1 record. picking
up a second place.

“Joe’s performed well for us the
last couple of years." said Stot-
tlemyer. “but I don‘t think that he‘s
ever been as strong as he is right
now. ‘

defense. Pitt was able to tire Young-
stown State by the middle of the
second half.

“Playing a I-3-I would have been
deadly since Youngstown State is a
good perimeter team." Saurer said.
"We didn’t let them get into the
perimeter. The only time they got
inside was on breakdowns.

"I was more interested in how we
played defensively. Our flexibity
helps us."

Youngstown State was held score-
less for over five minutes in the
second half as Pitt pulled out from a
tight five-point lead. 53-45. to score
I0 unanswered points during that
span. The Penguins turned the ball
over six times during their dry spell
as the Lady Panthers converted
three Bruce lay-ups. a Fubio five-
foot jumper down the left baseline
and a Gilhooley I5-foot jumper.

In the first half. both teams were
turning up the running ' game.
Youngstown State depended on the
outside shooting of forward
Danielle Carson  who had I0 of
her I4 points in the opening half.
Pitt was only able to get seven points
up while the Penguins could only cut
the lead down to three after the mid-
way point of the first half.

“In the first half. the area in which
we were successful was getting the

Both Jelic and Throckmorton
have a chance to make the record
books as Pitt’s winningest wrestler.
With Jelic at 50 wins and Throck-
morton at 48 wins. the current
record of 68 held by Stottlemyer is in
jeopardy of being broken.

The two other Panthers in the
starting lineup that made the trip to
the Eastern Nationals are sopho-
mores Kyle Nellis (I26 lbs.). who
placed fifth. and Joe Bond (I50 Ibs.).
who placed sixth.

Nellis takes over the I26-lb.
weight class after finishing his fresh-
man season with a I5-ll record at

missed much of last year due to

take the spot from Nellis.

ball in the paint area." Saurer said.

In the latter part of the game.
Saurer installed a spread offense to
either get the ball to Bruce inside or
get the easy backdoor lay-up. The
method backfired. as Youngstown
State cut the lead from 74-58 at the
4:20 mark to 74-65 at 2:00 on a short
jumper by Margaret Porter. a lay-up
by freshman guard Elise Betz and
free throws by Mary Jo Vodenichar
and Margaret Peters.

“At the end. they didn't have
enough poise to run the offense,"
Saurer said. “But I didn't help them
enough to set up the offense. and
that's my fault.“

But the Lady Panthers recovered
from the slight scare and finished
strong. scoring the game‘s final
seven points.

Despite the large margin, Saurer
was nevertheless impressed with
Youngstown State. a team which
only lost by four to Cleveland State,
a 24-game winner last season.

“They are going to win.“ she said.
“Theyjust have to establish an inside
game."

As for the Lady Panther future.
Saurer believes the critical factor is
to get another scoring threat to ease
the burden of Bruce. That may
happen when 6-5 center Jennifer
Tyner becomes eligible in January.

“Tyner will open the inside up,"
she said. “And it will take the pres-
sure off Jennifer.“

Tonight

At II8 lbs.. junior Gary Snyder
will be tested for the first time at that
weight. Snyder, previously at I26-
lbs., had little varsity experience but
could surprise some people this year.

Sophomore Gary Bolin will,
resume his spot at I42 lbs. Bolin
took over that weight in the mid-
season last year to finish fourth in
the EWL.

The I58-lb. position is still
unfilled with Sherman Moyer the
likely choice for the Waynesburg
match. but senior Dan Lecce may
get the nod later in the week at the
Penn State Invitational.

The I58-lb. weight class also
awaits the return of former EWL
Champion Doug Haines. who was
forced out of competition last year
because of a knee injury. If rehabili-
tation progresses as scheduled,
Haines could see action sometime in
January. 7

Chipman Revisiting Old Haunt: Lafayette -

By scorr DELLE1T

There will be no ticker-tape
parade when the Panther basketball
team arrives in Easton, Pa., for a
game tonight against Lafayette, but
people will recognize Roy Chipman.

It is hard to forget a man who in
his three years at the Lafayette helm
led the Leopards to a 60-28 record
along with two East Coast Confer-
ence championships. ln his first sea-
son, the team compiled the second
most wins in Lafayette history and
was the first team to go through con-
ference play undefeated. And it is
difficult for Chipman — although he
pushed away sentiment in last sea-
son's contest due to the Panthers’ 5-5
start — to set aside a large, impor-
tant part of his coaching career.

“There will be a little bit of emo-

tion,” Chipman said. “I have not
seen Lafayette since I left.”

“There will be some ties. Going
back in the building [Kirby Field
House]...going into the vistors
locker, which l‘ve never seen
before.“

Then there are the games that will
always stand out in Chipman's
mind, those contests where the

“There are two games that I
remember," Chipman recalls. “The
first was the year Rutgers won the
Eastern Eight with James Bailey.
We beat them by six at Rutgers. The
second game was against LaSalle at
home when they had Michael
Brooks, who is playing in the NBA.
We hit a last-second shot to win by
one.“

It has been a while since Lafayette
has experienced this type of eupho-
ria. Chipman’s successor, Will
Rackley, has faced difficulty main-

taining the brand of basketball
Lafayette is accustomed to. as evi-
denced by his 34-49 record in his first
three years. including a 7-2| record
in I982-83. The Easton natives are
getting impatient.

“They’re like fans anywhere,"
Chipman said. “Will had his prob-
lems last year.

“In my second year. after winning
23 games. we lost four starters to
graduation and a fifth missed three-
quarters of the season with a stress
fracture. That year we won 16 games
and the fans were relatively
unhappy."

So one can imagine the reaction to
a 2|-loss campaign. Rackley has
learned to live with the pressure.

“We just have to go out and do 5

our best,” he said. “We are rebuild-
ing the right way. We won’t bring in
transfers or players who can’t make
it academically.“

The Leopards are in the tail end of
a rigorous opening stretch.
Lafayette found its first win Mon-
day night defeating Medrian. a Div-
ision lll school, 70-58. last
weekend. the Leopards lost to Vir-
ginia and Richmond in the Cavalier
Classic.

Even though one may consider
the opening part of Pitt's schedule as
a pastry-lover’s delight, Chipman is
wary of his return to Easton.

“Their court is not an easy place to
play," he said. “And they will be
fired up because I was the previous
coachf‘

“You can't play all your early sea-
son games at home. You have to
play the tough ones on the road.”

teammates of Panther forward
Andre Williams at Berghaum High
School in Brooklyn.

Two freshman have broken into
the Lafayette starting lineup. For-
ward Joey Graham gives the Leo-
pards some height at 6-7 while Ron
Reynolds. a 6-2 guard from Swiss-
vale High School, leads the team in
scoring with l5.7 points per game,
including 29 against Medrian.

“Ron is improving every game,"
Rackley said. “He will be a fine
player before he is finished.”

One move Rackley has made is to
keep last year's starting guard Chet
Brightful on the bench at tipoff, a
similar move employed by Chipman
with guard Darrell Gissendanner
two years ago. Even though he does
not start, Brightful has averaged 30
minutes of playing time while scor-
ing ll points per game.

“It is a situation where Chet feels
more comfortable coming off the
bench,” Rackley said. “He is getting
into the flow ofthe game. It's no big
deal.”

Exactly the same reason Chipman
gave when he benched Gissen-
danner. Perhaps this could be
expected — Chipman coached
Rackley at Hartwick during the
early 70’s. Later, Rackley was Chip-
man’s top assistant at Lafayette
before taking over in I980.

“I talk to him at least once a
week,” Chipman said. “Will's assist-
ant, John Leone, and his brother
played with me at Hartwick. We've
grown very close over the years.”

But this is college basketball, not a
class reunion. And for two hours
tonight, the two will be fierce
adversaries.

“l have feelings for the program,”
Chipman said. “I like to see them do
well, but not tonight."

“Roy is a personal friend of
mine,” Rackley said, “but tonight he
is an opponent and that’s the way
you have to look at it.”

Congemi, Wallace Rise From The Unknown

By CHARLIE O'HARA

Training camp for the Pitt foot-
ball team is as distant a memory now
as the galaxy’s nearest planet. But it
wasn't that long ago that John Con-
gemi and Bill Wallace remember
their status on what was to be a
rebuilt team.

Their respective standings hardly

I resembled the heights of shooting

stars. Congemi entering I983 a
third-string quarterback and Wal-
lace filling a split end apartment
vacated by highly-touted Julius
Dawkins, the Pitt-Penn State affair
took care of any lack of respect.
Despite the 24-24 tie with the
arch-rival Nittany Lions, the
Congemi-Wallace connection made
PSU defenders quite aware that this
tandem is indeed for real.
In all, the two connected I0 times
for I73 yards and three touchdowns.
, As quarterback, it was John Con-
gemi (21 of 29 for 284 yards and no
interceptions) who led his troops up
and down the field all day. He was
confident, as usual. Never a sign of
hesitation switching a play at the line
of scrimmage to combat Penn State
defenses.

Several times in the first half, the
two made their shattering presence
felt. The most impressive of the

. hook-ups came with 5:48 to play in

the first half, when Congemi found
No. 25 in the right corner of the end
zone for the first Pitt touchdown.

In the second half, it was time to
showcase the duo's talents under

pressure.

On Pitt’s initial possession of the
second half, the offense set up the
big pass play by staying on the
ground, coming away with three
successive running first downs. The
Panthers had the ball first down at
Penn State’s 45.

After a play-action fake to his full-
back, Congemi dropped back and
hit Wallace, streaking past Penn
State cornerback Mark Fruehan

down the right sideline for the
Panthers’ second touchdown.

Pitt entered the fourth quarter
still trailing 21-17.

The Panthers received the ball for
the final time, the clock showing
only 4245 and the ball at Pitt‘s 27.

Taking no chances, they kept the
ball on the ground. Two first downs
later, the Panthers were at the Nit-
tany Lions’ 42. Third down and two,
and it was time again.

V After a crucial third-down recep-
tion by Wallace, good for I8 yards,
the Panthers had a first down at the
Penn State 23.

Pitt was on the threshold of
defeating the Lions for the first time
since 1980 and the first time at Pitt
Stadium since 1965.

Wallace was to run an 8l route.
On this play, he executes a I0-yard
out pattern, then Congemi pumps to
him in an effort to fake thedefender.
Wallace then continues up the field,
toward the end zone. A

Congemi provided the perfect toss
and Wallace wrapped his hands
securely around the pigskin for the
touchdown.

Hence, the Panthers had retained‘

the lead and Wallace got mobbed.
“John had the option to either
receiver on the play,” Wallace said.
“He chose me. ljust made sure thatl
got my feet in bounds. They’ve

called me enough times this year for
being out.”

“Bill did a good job injust picking
up the audible [play change at the
line of scrimmage],” Congemi said.
“His catch was super. We had a great
day.

15

iilohn Congemi

They certainly weren't the only
individuals on the field to notice,
though.

“Congemi contiually caught us in
defensive situations," Penn State
linebacker Scott Radecic said. “And
Wallace made some outstanding
catches. They [Pitt] were the most
physically tough team we've played
all year. They played a great offen-
sive football game.”

“Pitt was able to adjust well all
day,” Penn State head coach Joe
Paterno said. “Wallace hurt us, and
Congemi played a super football
game.”

It wasn’t until the I l-game regular
season had passed that the
Congemi-Wallace connection had
been given its due respect.

The season started slow. There
were signs of brillance, though.

After the season opener in which
Wallace only caught one ball and
Congemi walked the sidelines, the
two connected four times for 60
yards against Temple.

In the third game of the season,
when the Panthers traveled to face
the Terrapins of Maryland, the offi-
cials showed little regard for two,
especially Wallace.

The Terps defeated Pitt 13-7 on a
blocked punt that was returned for a
touchdown. The play directly before
the blocked punt, Congemi had hit

Page l_l

Wallace on a sideline pattern 25
yards up the field._ The completion
would have given the Panthers a first
down in Maryland territory.

On the play, though, Wallace
jumped up to catch the ball. He was
well in bounds, but when the
Terapin defender hit him, he landed
out of bounds. He was clearly forced
out of bounds by the defender as the
replay showed.

At West Virginia, a week later, the
Congemi-Wallace connection
struck for their first touchdown, a
35-yarder, that had put the Panthers
in" front. On that day, they connected
four times for 63 yards.

Florida State was a big win, but
the connection was held to one
hook-up for 16 yards. Congemi
started a three-game streak without
throwing an interception.

Louisville provided a breather,
but Congemi still found Wallace for
a I5-yard touchdown.

It was time for Navy. The second
big-play touchdown pass to Wal-
lace. It went for 39 yards as the duo
teamed for 80 yards on three com-
pletions.. Another poor call by offi-
cials nulliﬁed a sideline reception by
Wallace. Still lacking in respect.

Pitt came home to play Syracuse,
and the offense had trouble getting
untracked. Congemi hit Wallace for

Smith An All-Achiever

By LISA GRENEVICKI

Dave Smith is quite an accom-
plished person. So much so it‘s diffi-
cult to determine what mountains
are left for him to scale. A three-year
letterman, All-East and a qualifier
for the NCAA Tournament. Smith,
a senior gymnast. now readies for an
international meet with Japanese
University.

The Japanese are among the elite
in the world of gymnastics and will
showcase their talents on Dec. 9 in
the Field House. Smith and the rest
of the Panthers will see action
against several of Japan‘s Olympic
hopefuls.

“We’re looking forward to the
meet,” Smith said of international
gymnasts‘ second visit to the Pitt
campus. “lt’s their national, their
best. We’ll compete respectably with
them, but most important, we'll
learn from them. I'd rather compete

against the best. You learn so much
from them, and it pushes you to do
your best."

Smith has already proved he‘s one
of the best, and this season will be no
different. He‘ll just stay laid back,
determined to maintain the status
quo.

"I‘m not treating this year any dif-
ferently." said Smith. a Butler
native, “I'll try to do everything I can
can to help out the team. I want to
keep it going.“

That isjust what he has done since
joining Pitt. Smith has been a con-
sistent leader on the floor exercise.
but last year, he developed into one
of Pitt‘s top all-around performers.
Having qualified for nationals the
last three years in floor exercise.
Smith looks to also compete on the
vault and high bar in this year's
NCAA Tournament in Los Angeles,
the site of the I984 Olympic Games.

His athletic ability budded
around age four. when he began
walking on his hands around the
house, but Smith did not start his
gymnastics career until eighth grade.
A friend of his. Andrew Moseley. a
gymnast at Slippery Rock, was the
one who dragged him to the gymnas-
tics practices at Butler High School.

lt‘s Pitt history from there.

“Dave is one of our top all-around
gymnasts,“ said Pitt head coach
Frank D’Amico. ‘'1 look to him to
help out the team score and to make
nationals again."

"Dave is a leader."assistant coach
Joe Femiani said. "He sets a good
example. He’s cool-headed. disci-
plined and can get thejob done. He's
a very respectable young man."

To be a good gymnast, one must
be willing to do the harder and more
dangerous tricks. Here, Smith seems
to have the inside track. As a moto-

MYTHS/FACTS ABOUT ALCOHOL

1. “lt’s Only Beer”. One beer or one glass 0
wine is about the same as one mixed drink
You’ll get just as drunk on beer or wine as or.
“hard liquor”.

2. “Drinking makes you sexy”. A man's capacity
for sex may be in inverse proportion to his
capacity for alcohol. “Drink provokes the desire
but it takes away the performance”.
Shakespeare

3. “People are friendlier when they're drunk”.
Yes, but they are also more hostile, dangerous,
criminal; alcohol releases both negative and
positive responses.

4. “Alcohol is a Stimulant”. Just like a hit on the
head with a hammer. Alcohol is a central ner-
vous system depressant.

5. l‘Peop|e Get Drunk/Sick When They Switch
Drinks”. Drinking too much causes people to
get drunk or sick.

6. “You've gotta hand it to Sam, he can really
hold his booze”. Sam may be developing atol-

erance for booze. Tolerance conotes need;
dependency.

tailback. suffered two recovered
injuries.

The ensuing grades are not subject
to parental conferences:

Quarterback: John Cummings
wished he never informally met
Alvin Toles. The Tennessee line-
backer pulverized between his arms
Cummings‘ left collarbone after a
ll()-yard display revealed Pitt
indeed was blessed with a post-Dan
Marine arm.

In his place. Congemi performed
admirably. For a sophomore. that
is; A scoreless second half against
Syracuse. lapses against Maryland
and no coherency in the Navy can-
test cannot be overlooked. Neither
can six interceptions. must they
occasionally be thrown.

Congemi did connect for l4 TDs
and passed for 1,599 yards for 57.4
percent accuracy. “Looking at his
stats. what has happened. looking at
Johns stats and what he’s done,”
said backfield coach Andy Urbanic.
“you‘d have to be a fool not to
appreciate it."

A lot of learning awaits him,
though. That means heeding more
complex and intricate pass routes,
learning how to weave through the
tentacles of secondaries and success-
fully connecting on lengthy post
patterns. Award him a B.

Backfield: It is said tailback Joe
McCall ran for 846 yards. Except
500 of those came the last three
games of the season in successive
I00-yard bursts each. After bruising
ribs at Tennessee and later pulling a
calf muscle in Maryland. leaving
McCall in alternating spots with
former prep star Chuck Scales or
Darnell Stone, the All-East candi-
date buried the past and finished
with a flourish.

“Not having a solid player there
without Joe was a concern to us,"
Urbanic remarked. “But I would
have to say he had a remarkable
second half of the season." Award
him a B+.

Back to Scales, name the Division
1 school and it was probably salivat-
ing over this freshman from Shady-
side Academy. Scales did finish with
2l0 yards. fourth overall. but never
really blossomed this year after
being handed a starting role in West
Virginia. Maybe the coaches didn‘t
want to rush his baptism by fire.
Award him a C.

Stone broke a bone in his hand in
that Mountaineer matchup and has
been out since. It‘s kinda hard to
grade someone who hasn’t really
been tested this year. Wait until next
year when both he and Scales
clamor for McCall's vacancy.

Oops, that's right. almost forgot
those fullbacks. Funny, on this Pitt
team, the tandem of Marlon McIn-
tyre and Marc Bailey seemed to have
played the role of kickers: no recog-
nition, but they get an importantjob
done.

While running two-three in net
yardage (Bailey, 44]; Mclntyre. 4l3)
for over ﬁve yards each jaunt. the
two have been used nondescriptly.
putting up manhole-cover blocks for
any one of the three regularly-used
tailbacks behind them. That was
while each alternated like
clockwork.

“We shufﬂed a lot of people out of
there and got a lot of mileage out of
Marlon and Marc.“ Urbanic said of
the two who were used to deliver the
coaches‘ plays. Award each an A-.

Receiving: He's got to be disap-
pointed, earlier remarks saying as
such. Flanker Dwight Collins did
not have the year the All-America

candidate believed he should have.

He wanted the ball more. yearned
standout status. No prima donna.
Collins deserved it.

In range of three records before
I983. Collins can still set Pitt marks
in TDs (tied. with 23). yardage (40
short of 2230) and receptions (9
short of I24). But after a shoulder
Separation and sprained ankle in
Separate games. Collins never deli-
vered the goods. Maybe the coaches
used him when they shouldn't have.
Maybe the new QB situatior.

In the split end department. all
you have to do is mention Bill Wal-
lace. Not only did he lead Pitt in the
Penn State game (I0 grabs. I73
yards, three TDs), he led the team in
receiving (37 receptions for 630
yards and eight TDs). Like McCall.
though. Wallace did not make his
presence felt until the Notre Dame
game. Award him a B+ only because
he was all-secrecy during the sea-
son’s first half.

lt's a little more difficult to grade
the tight ends. who were expected to
run more blocking roles. And they
did theirjobs. but none really stood
out. As a group —— the Clint Wilsons
at: Pat Schipanis —— award the two

Interior line: A crime of major
proportions will occur if tackle Bill
Fralic is not awarded the Lombardi
Trophy, given the nation‘s outstand-
ing lineman. The reasons are simple:
he's strong (for lack of a better
word). and no one ever gets by him.

The same could not be said at
training camp in late August. No
one really knew how the Browns.
Tony and Bob. Mike Dorundo.
Mike Dahl and Greg Christy would
gel. Judging from the apparent lack
of sacks each game and air-tight
quarterback pockets from week to
week. the group looked tighter than
packaged sticks of gum.

And that. even though Dorundo
and Dahl suffered hamstring injur-
ies during the year and Christy came
off a knee-injury season (1982).
Another group grade here: A-.

“Its been a very interesting season
for the offense." Urbanic said. “I
compare this team to two years ago.
when we lost Hugh Green and so on.
We had no-name people coming
back; not many people expected a
lot of things from that team. yet we
were on the crest of a national
championship.

“This year we had similar no-
names. We took it upon ourselves as
a challenge to show how wrong
those pre-season predicitions were."

the fourth time in the end zone. This
one was for 25 yards.

Notre Dame and the CBS televi-
sion audience were made witnesses
that Congemi and Wallace could
play. A 44-yard strike and 90 yards
on five catches were proof enough.

The officials. for the third time in
the season. called Wallace out of
bounds after he made a reception on
the sideline. Wallace had to be get-
ting frustrated.

“So many times during the season
l‘ve been called out of bounds."
Wallace said. “I was getting tired of
it."

The Army game was only a rest
before the Nittany‘s came to town.
Wallace grabbed three passes for 34
yards, but Joe McCall stole the day.

Penn State's performance capped
the season.

The same season that began with
such a cloud over the Pitt offensive
unit. John Cummings. the starting
quarterback at fall camp‘s end. and
Dwight Collins the pre-season All-
America flanker. caught the
attention.

By season’s end however. Con-
gemi completed 57.4 percent of his
passes (I36 of 242) for l,599 yards.
His touchdown-to-interception
ratio was l4 to six.

Wallace finished the campaign
with 37 catches for 630 yards_(l7
yards per reception) and eight
touchdowns.

The Fiesta Bowl remains for the
l983 season, and a good bet would
find Ohio State (Pitt's opponent in
the bowl game) hawking the
Congemi-Wallace connection rather
than waiting for proof.

answer for sophomore Jack
Uppling, who similarly missed last
season because of a knee injury.
Uppling is a former high school All-
America whose season was ended
before it started last year; but
according to Stottlemyer, he is ready
for collegiate competition.

At I90 lbs., one Panther wrestler
who may not get a chance to come
back following surgery is senior
Frank Rich, who placed fourth at
the EWL‘s two years ago but missed
the tournament last year because of
surgery on his knee.

A likely replacement for the Way-
nesburg match is freshman Curtis
Conner from Grove City High
SchooL P

Conner is inexperienced at the
college level, but according to Stot-
tlemyer, he is progressing incredibly
fast and will be an asset to the
Panther lineup.

Opening Strong

At heavy weight, senior Dan Kas-
perkoski, a three-year letterman,
will be back to take over his starting
role.

Kasperkoski may also get some
competition later in the season from
Dennis Atiyeh should Atiyeh decide
to return to the mats after the foot-
ball season is over. Two years ago,
Atiyeh placed third at the EWL‘s but
redshirted last year to concentrate
on football.

Looking at Waynesburg, Stot-
tlemyer is hesitant about making
any kind ofajudgement concerning
the obvious underdog.

“I don‘t know what they have this
year.“ he said. “We should have little
trouble beating them, but we don‘t
want to make a mistake of looking
ahead to Penn State. This could
show us how we’re coming along,
but I think that the Penn State Invi-
tational will be a much better
indicator."

‘’ WITH THE REAL ITALIAN TOUCH

Last year, the Panthers trounced
Waynesburg 4l-8. '

“At this point in the season, I’m
happy with our performance," said
Stottlemyer, “but we are not getting
overly excited about it. Jeff [Jelic]
and Joe [Throckmorton] and the
rest of guys should be applauded for
their efforts so far this year, but it’s
not how well you get out ofthe gate
that counts, it's how you finish."

Although Stottlemyer is hoping
for a good dual-meet season, his
emphasis will be on the EWL Tour-
nament at the end of the year.

“Our only problem is trying to get
wrestlers in the wrestling room every
day." he said, referring to the injury
situations of Uppling, Haines and
Rich.

After the Panthers play host to
Waynesburg today. they will travel
to the Penn State Invitational,
which will be held tomorrow, Friday
and Saturday.

friends said he “had no fear” when
younger.

“I can't say I have no fear." Smith
said. “I guess I just have a higher
level of fear than others. To get bet-
ter in gymnastics you have to go for
stuff. You can't be‘ afraid to do a
trick or you won‘t do it. I remember
trying my first back ﬂip, sure I was
scared, but ifl stopped there I would
have never gone on.

“That's what I like about gymnas-
tics, the excitment in doing a trick
that is tough. Pulling off somethinﬂ
you thought you couldn't is the
greatest feeling. That thrill —~ that’s
what it's all about. But once I learn a
trick, I don't get anything out of
doing it. That‘s what makes me want
to go on to harder and more chal-
lenging tricks. To get that sense of
thrill back into it.”

What a thrill Smith lends an
audience. Currently he is working
on two difficult dismounts from the
high bar — a triple somersault and a
double back layout, one of which he
would like to perform against the
Japanese.

“Dave does have a fear level much
higher than most people," Femiani
said. “That’s what makes him an
outstanding gymnast. He’s not
afraid to attempt and work at a very
hard trick." -

It seems Smith gets something
very special out of gymnastics, but
after this season, he doesn't see him-
self competing any longer.

“Grad school will be more impor-
tant to me next year," he remarked.
“I'd like to assistant coach here at
Pitt and work out now and then. As
far as competition. I may try out for
a few invitationals in the summer,
but you have to really work hard and
dedicate yourself if you want to try
out for the Olympics.

“I‘ve accomplished my goals while
I’ve been here. I made it to nationals,
and I’m ranked in the top l0 in the
East. I’d like to make nationals once

again this year, and I’d like to see
the team go, too. We have a good

-chance of doing that if we stay

injury-free and work really hard at
it."

The road to a great season starts
next Friday with the Japanese visit-
ing the Field House. Smith appears
ready for the challenge.
