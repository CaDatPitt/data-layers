Constructive Measures Planned
As Registration Total Tops
Pre-Semester Estimates

Work On Heinz Chapel

By Morton Harris

“In the spirit of the times” the Uni-
versity Administration announces a
constructive program for the next
year involving three major problems.
The ﬁrst is concerned with the fac-
ulty itself; the second and third in-
volve the Frick Acres building plans.

Nearly twenty of the teaching staff
who were warned last spring that
they probably would not be retained

this semester because of cut appro-4

priations are back on the job, accord-
ing to John Weber, business manager
of the University.

While only four of these are work-.

ing full-time, and the rest are on a
half or two-thirds basis, this is de-
cidedly more than even the most op-
timistic hoped for one month ago.
Weber points to registration ﬁgures
"which exceeded our best estimates”
as a plausible explanation for their re-
tention.

Erie Center, Johnstown Center, and
the School of Education in conjunc-
tion with the Extension Division are
the schools aﬁected by this re-employ-r
ment, but, as yet, no report has been
made. concerning the “sixty graduate
assistants and instructors who have
been cut for increased economies.” ]

Second on the list is the announce-
ment that the University has author-
ized shipment of the remaining stone
needed for the Cathedral, about 40
carloads of limestone worth almost
$50,000. This completes the contract
for the $125,000 worth of stone orig-
inally ordered and which the School
has seen ﬁt to purchase in install-
ments.

Chieﬂy blocks for the entrances,
they will not be set until a much
later date, but will be stored on the
second ﬂoor of the Cathedral until
ready for use.

The third point is developing as
work progresses on the Heinz Memo-
rial chapel, a gift to the University
by the children of thelate founder of
the H. J. Heinz company. Excava-
tion is nearly completed, and the con-
crete foundation is ready for setting.

In the meantime, a sample wall be
erected as a basis for judgment of ex-
pansion and contraction of the Bed-
ford stone to be used in the exterior
wall.

The memorial, costing $800,000,
will face the Cathedral on the Belle-
ﬁeld avenue side of the campus, 320
feet from the main entrance. Speci-
ﬁcations call for a span of 33 feet be-
tween the columns of the have. The
overall dimensions of the building
are 155 feet by 57 feet, with the
height to the ridge of the nave 100
feet and the height to the tip of the
ﬂech 245 feet.

The vaults are of Guastivino tiles,
the ﬂoors of Crab Orchard stone, the
pulpit, narthex, screen, choir stalls.
and pews of old English carved oak.

According to an estimate by the
contractors, the building will be com-
pleted within 16 months. It will ac-
commodate about 500 people.

Social Justice
League Refused
Campus Charter

 

Council Subsidiary Group
Acts Quickly On First
Test "Of Year,

Derr Appeal Fails

In its first major trial as a, student
administrative body. student relations
committee of Student Council, headed
by Ray Mccune, E34, Thursday after-
noon denied the charter petition of
the Student Branch, -League for So-
cial Justice.

According to King Derr, C35, head
of the League, “student relations com-
mittee told 11s when our temporary
charter was issued last semester that
our grant would be renewed this year
if our group committed no overt act.
We have complied with that rule, yet
our charter has been refused."

Before Derr and Mgrjvgrie Hanson,
C34, were called into the Heinz house
room to give the League’s viewpoint
on the charter petition, the student
relations group read, considered, and
passed the denying resolution.

Introducing the motion for denial
of the charter was Kenneth Host,
E34, who explained his stand in a
typed three-point proposal. Jack
Wyeth, C35, seconded the move, and
the vote which followed was unan-
imously against the League.

Derr and Miss Hanson analyzed the
motion point by point, and attempted
to show that each of the objections
to issuance of the charter was un-

founded. They rejected the idea of

seeking permission for each meeting
under the name of one person instead
of that of the organization, and pro-
posed instead that they might be
granted a charter under some such
name as a “World Problems Club.”

The committee reconsidered the
resolution after the League members
had withdrawn, but upheld their orig-
inal view. One of the committee mem-
bers remarked, “In allowing tempor-
ary permits for individual meetings
and discussion groups, we are of
course not permitting all that such a
group as this desires. Yet the same
purpose will be served in the end, and
discussion of social, economic, and po-
litical questions can remain free and
open.” '

 

Furniture Collected For
Cathedral’s Chinese Room

 

Furniture reproduced from original
pieces found in ancient palaces of
early Chinese dynasties, to be used
in the Chinese room of the Cathedral
of Learning is being collected by the
University. The articles are design-
ed by Teng Kwei, head of the De-

Band, Cheerleaders To Stir
Spirit As Plays Seen,
Heard By Wire

Purchased, delivered, and ready for
use, the grid graph is being stored in
the Cathedraliuntil its Pitt debut on
October 21, when it will give students
and the public in Memorial Hall a
play-by-play description of the Pitt-
Minnesota game at Minneapolis.

Under the chairmanship of James
Danahey, C34, the grid graph commit-
tee of Student Council is beginning to
publicize the football assemblies.
Through posters, blackboard an-
nouncements, and statements at the
mass meeting on October 17, the
group will acquaint the student body
with the features of the graph.

As planned, spectators will pay 25
cents to watch the action of the
games in electric lights. First in the
Minnesota engagement, and the next
Saturday in the Notre Dame affair, a
light on a miniature gridiron will
trace the course of action. Lights
will ﬂash as players punt, pass, run,
or intercept passes. Touchdowns,
touchbacks, or field goals will be im-
mediately shown.

Cheerleaders and the University band
are scheduled to appear at each as-
sembly, and will lend a realistic air
to the reproduced games. The com-
mittee in charge, in announcing the
meetings, declares, “See your team
play away from home.”

Preliminary tests yesterday afternoon
showing the Pitt-West Virginia game
in detail heralded the success of the
affair. The ﬁrst of the grid graphs
was used at Ohio State university in
1921 and since that time numerous
improvements on the machine have
made it a true reproducer of gridiron
action.

Debaters Discuss  
Bank Guarantee

An unusual feature of Association
membership qualiﬁcations for the last
few years is the provision that reg-
ular, as well as prospective, mem-
bers must give an acceptable tryout
speech at the opening of the fall sea-
son,

Economic conditions will probably
necessitate a decrease in the Associa-
tion’s forensic activities. Manager
Saul Shapira, -C34, however, has al-
ready begun contacting for local en-
gagements and expects to have a well-
ﬁlled schedule for the debaters within
the month.

Tryouts for memberships in the
Men’s Debating Association will be-
gin Thursday afternoon, October 19,
at 2:30 o’clock, in room 217, Alumni
Hall, Dr. W. M, Parrish, coach, an-
nounced today,

In the form of a ﬁve minute dis-
cussion, the tryouts will deal with
controversial phases of the article in
the Glass-Steagall banking act, which
deals with the guaranteeing of bank
deposits. Candidates, in their talk,
will take a stand for or against the

Formichella Will “Present
Delayed Petition Before
‘ Early Group Meet

Plan Immediate Action

F0110WiI1g an unaccountable delay
in presenting its petition to student
relations committee for a charter last
Thursday, the Council of International
Clubs will offer its petition at an early
meeting of the committee, Emeric
Formichella, C34, leader of the group,
inferred yesterday. The clubs are
Campus organizations whose activities
have been centered in the furnish-
ing and completion of the ﬁfteen na-
tionality class rooms in the Cathedral.

The reason for delaying action on
the petition at last week’s student re-
lations commitee meeting was not re-
vealed 'by Formichella. A letter to
the chairman of the committee held
up action on the petition indeﬁnitely.

Questioned by a Pitt News repre-
sentative, Formichella would give no
clue to the cancellation of the peti-
tion, instead, admitting that no
adequate reason for cancelling the
petition altogether had been present-
ed, he announced that the petition in
its original form would be offered to
the students relations committee
soon.

From other reliable, but unofficial
sources, the Pitt News revealed that
some objection had been raised, over
the present name of the group. VVhen
that easy barrier is cleared, the Pitt
News was told, the petition would be
presented and the charter probably
granted.

In the wake of the delay over the

international council's petition uncer-‘

tainty has clouded statements of both
international council leaders and
campus student officials. No light on
the situation would bo cast by either
group.

Formichella’s announcement yester-
day that the petition will be presented
is the ﬁrst move by a member of
either side toward deﬁnite action on
the affair.

 

Dr. Goodale Returns From
National Metal Congress

Dr, Stephen L, Goodale, professor
and head of the department of metal-
lurgy. returned last week from a trip
to Detroit, Michigan, where he at-
tended the convention of the National
Metal Congress. This is made up of
representatives from the American

‘Germany’, Topic
Of Ewers’ Talk

Inquiry Club Speaker Discusses
Present German Situation

 

“The Republic of Germany is
through!”
With these words Dr. John Ray

Ewers, of the East End Christian
Church, opened his address to the
Inquiry Club last Wednesday on “The
Situation in Germany.”

“For fourteen years Germany has
been stewing in its own juice,” Dr.
Ewers went on. “Now she is ready
to act.”

Brieﬂy Dr. Ewers explained his
eight -reasons for the present German
dictatorship.

“Hatred of the Versailles Treaty is
the most important of these,” he said.
“The desire for colonies, fear of com-
munism, hatred of the Jew; all of
these, although important, are over-
shadowed by the one great desire
for a place in the sun.”

Dr, Ewers deemed “this hangover
from the Bismarckian era” as the real
cause for Hitler’s rise,

“Hitler promised to wipe out the
war debts. He promised to regain
the colonies, crush communism, chase
out the Jews, and most important of
all revise the Versailles Treaty. Who
wouldn't vote for a man like that!”

And then touching briefly on Hitler,
the man, he asserted, “I regret that
he is there. Though Hitler is no fool,
neither is he an educated or a wise
man.”

“But he was cunning enough to
capitalize on the emotions of the Ger-
man People,” Dr. Ewers brought out.
“Germany today has but one party,”
he said: “and that party is for Hitler,
the commander of two million men,
who will stop at nothing.”

“And so,” concluded Dr. Ewers, “all
Europe waits——and watches, while
Hitler, a clever cunning devil, gyrates
up there at the head of a German
dictatorship with the shadow of an-
other Hohenzollern empire hovering
ever in the background.” ‘ '

Tomorrow E. A. Holbrook, head of
the engineering department, ' will

- speak on “The Formation of the Coal

Code.” The meeting will take place in
Room 107 Alumni hall at 12:30 o’clock.

Students Selected By‘ Departments
To Foster Class Spirit

 

To foster a better class spirit a.nd to
present a uniﬁed group in School of

The ﬁrst department to elect their
representative was the mining who
selected Herbert Fine, M34. The
metallurgy, oil and gas, and petro-
leum reﬁning departments will elect
their men this Thursday.

Current conditions in the coal and
metal industries, the coal codes and
their relation with the metal ones,
were discussed by Herbert Fine, M34.

Student Council vs. The Pitt News
Round (?)

UR EDITORIAL, “The Big Bad
\Volf‘.l” in the last issue of the
Pitt News burst a riot of senti-
ment over the head of the editor,
and a delegation of Council
leaders politely, but ﬁrmly, an-
nounced that our dunderhead
attitude was putting the well-

known “wrench” into the equally well-known
“works.” Although we did not particularly
mind the Council members’ invective nor the

 

, pretty names which they chose to call us, the reﬂec-

tion on our sincerity in the best interests of Stu-
dent Council and its subsidiary, student relations
committee, is a mistaken assumption on the part of
Council leaders that the Pitt News editorial policy
is one of destructively malicious criticism.

Following the announcement of Council ’s
eleven-point program, the Pitt News editorially
commended Council for its ambitious work and,
although it disagreed on some points in the pro-
gram, The News was elated that Council had laid
out a deﬁnite year ’s work for itself. Our attitude
toward Council has been, and will be, one of sin-
cere cooperation, but cooperation does not mean
that we agree with everything Council does, nor

that we applaud everything Council suggests.

Campus activities this early in the semester have
attained a mid-season momentum, due largely to the
leadership abilities of the men in charge. The Pitt
News is primarily interested in maintaining this
momentum and accelerating it to the best advant-
age of each and every student activity on the cam-
pus. And if we editorially criticize the activities
of student relations committee in regard to the
proposed investigation of campus clubs, we do so
because we feel that the investigation is leading
the committee off on a tangent and away from the
real work which it can do to maintain the interest
in activities which has been already so evident.

In a private conference with activities leaders
we oﬂicially announced our interest in the work of
student relations committee. We agreed to sup-
port student relations committee in any movement
which would help campus activities. And we crit-
icized the committee ’s plan to investigate campus
clubs because we felt, and still feel, that such an
investigation is not at the moment the most vital
problem that faces the group.

“You yell that Council and student relations
committee aren’t doing anything, and when we do,
you tear into us and criticize us,” said Jack Mc-
Parland, Student Council president. “You haven ’t
printed ONE commendatory editorial this year,”
said John P. Bracken, president of ODK. Yet these
gentlemen either didn’t read or have already for-
gotten such editorials as, “Ten Points And One,”
in our issue of September 29, a sentence of which
read, “The Pitt News congratulates Council for
presenting a deﬁnite point-by-point program.” In
our issue of September 26, an editorial headed
“Ideals Stage a Comeback,” lauded Mr. Bracken’s
speech in the Student Council-sponsored activities
assembly for freshmen.

It is regrettable that our stand on these
points requires such lengthy elucidation. We have
gone along feeling that heads of Student Council
have understood our motives so far as our edito-

rial policy was concerned. Yet we are charged
with insincerity, disloyalty, and hypocrisy!

If Council expects the Pitt News to become edi-
torially less aggressive and to write nothing but
commendatory editorials, our legislative friends
are greatly mistaken. The Pitt News CAN be sin-
cere, CAN be loyal, and yet comment on and criti-
cise in an aggressive manner any and all activities
of our student legislators.

 

A Real Mascot
E UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH is going to have

a real, live Panther as its official mascot. This an-
nouncement which is being announced exclusively in the
Pitt News columns today should swell the hearts of all
loyal sports followers of the University. It is the estab-
ishment of a tradition which promises to become one of
the more important heritages of the school.

We have always needed a real Panther. Somehow we
felt lost when the Navy brought its goat or the Army Its
mule. And now we go both one better and march 9.
real, live Panther on the ﬁeld!

It cannot be argued that the acquisition of Pitt's new
mas-cot will be an impetus to that vague something called
“school spirit.” We already feel the surge of enthu-
siasm that will greet the newcomer to the ﬁeld on Satur-
day. It's exactly what we have needed to furnish the
ﬁnishing touch to real college drama.

Pitt has long been berated, even by its own students,
as a place where “school spirit” doesn't exist. The very
nature of our metropolitan environment Is undoubedly a
cause for some measure of conservatism where “Joe Col-
lege” antics are concerned. But there IS school spirit
at Pitt, the sort of spirit that can not be deﬁned by rah-
rah yells and vociferous incantations. And our new pan-
ther mascot is to be at last the embodiment of what
school spirit at Pitt can mean.

“A Subtle Emanation”
By Saul Weisberg

Editor's Note: ‘The opinions expressed in this column
are the personal views of this columnist and are not
to be taken as the editorial policy of the Pitt News.

‘Student relations committee in handing down one of
its most important decisions has issued an opinion,
which though it may be astonishing to the few, is in
keeping with its makeup. By its decree it has vindi-
cated the trust reposed in it by fraternity-controlled
Student Council.

This august committee in solemn conclave assembled
has felt itself called upon to refuse the petition for a
charter presented by the League for Social Justice. The
reasons advanced are so ﬂimsy and transparent that
they hardly bear inspection or deserve refutation. But
for the uninformed many, passing notice is perhaps de-
sirable.

Feeling apparently that university organizations must
function in vacuo, this select group of students has ﬁrst
advanced the objections that the League is affiliated
with an outside organization, which, though perhaps vir-
tuous in itself has no place on the Pitt campus. Were
this a valid objection, which obviously it is not, It
would be readily met by King Derr’s offer to sever
connections with the parent organization. Furthermore,
continues the committee, the group is organized In fur-
therance of its own aims as distinct from those of the

University. I have saved the committee the embarrass-
ment of asking them the purposes of a university or the
aims of the League, and in what respects they conﬂict.
Come to think of it, I won't save them the embarrass-
ment. I inquire speciﬁcally to what does the committee
object?

The student relations committee also expresses the
opinion that the proposed functions of the League are
fulﬁlled by sundry other organizations. What organiza-
tions does the committee have in mind? Druids? ODK?
The only group remotely reseembling the League is the
Inquiry Club, and the committee should know that the
latter group is concerned primarily with the absorption
of knowledge and not with the intensive discussion of
social problems.

Perhaps I have been unfair to the committee. They
have done well in presenting respectable reasons where
no bona ﬁde ones exist.

Week-end Features Round Of Dances And Smokers For
New Rushees—-and Some Perennial Ones

Fraternity rushing opened with the
proverbial bang Friday morning at
8:30 o’clock with all sixteen men’s
campus social groups hard at work
making impressions.

Approximately 500 first-semester
freshmen are eligible for membership
in fraternities, and these, along with
many advanced freshmen, upperclass-
men, and transfers are on the receiv-
ing end of a series of entertainments
and parties.

As usual, many uppercla-ssmen com-
ing to the campus for the ﬁrst time,
after having attended off-campus cen-
ters, are popular rushees, and the fact
that the majority will be “house men"
—will live in fraternity houses if
pledged—-has made them particularly
attractive to the competing fraterni-
ties.

Over the week-end, many dances
and smokers were on the programs
for the Greek letter organizations.
There will probably be no dances sched-
uled this week, however, until Friday
night. in accord with a ruling’ of the
office of the dean of men restricting
such affairs only to nights preceding
school holidays. Rushees will be en-
tertained in the interim by theater,
bridge, and bowling parties, and by a
number of smokers.

At the College Association Kickoff
Dance Friday, were seen a group of
rushees who attended as guests of
fraternities. A few were also treated
to a trip to the West Virginia football

Campus Parade At Coed Prom In
Male Attire; Orchestra All-Feminine

Women Prominent On

 

By Helen Rose Gibson
“I have to scram home before my
Dad gets home from the lodge and

ﬁnds out I took his tux,” and with
this explanation a young lady attend-
ing the Coed Prom held last Wednes-
day night in Heinz House turned up
the cuffs of her trousers, jammed a
derby over her blonde permanent
and caught a city-bound car.
Freshman girls attending the affair
wore the conventional rompers-sox-
short - dress - hair - ribbons costumes,
but the upperclass girls offered the
most unusual array of men's attire
seen at any campus affair. Betty
Quarrie was there in a trim brown
suit with green turtle-neck sweater
and Betty Black gave the Navy a big
boost with her sailor costume.
Merle Metzger gave evidence that
simplicity in cut and color will be the
keynote in the costume of the well-
dressed devil this season, and Gracia
Faust showed how a real Scotsman
wears his kilties. Eunice Natalie
spent the evening explaining that her
gold and red uniform did not belong
to the Royal Mounties, but to the
drum major of the American Legion
Band of Elizabeth, Pennsylvania.
Among the best looking boys pres-
ent were the Panther fashion com-

game at Morgantown Saturday after-
noon.

There were evident, at nearly all
houses conducting affairs, a. good
share of perennial rushees——upper-?
elassmen who may some day fully de-
cide to make the step, or not to make
it. In the meantime, semi-annually
they are being treated to one dance
after another, to one smoker after an-
other, and for a week to nightly up-
stairs conferences opening: “Well.
fellow, you've gotten a good slant on
us by this time. When are we going
to pjut the little pin in your lapel?”

One of the features rushing season
usually brings out which is of inter-
est to the whole campus, and which
is particularly good meat for the
News staff, is due in the next issue.
At that time Theodore W. Biddle, as-
sistant to the dean of men, will as-
sume the role of prophet and will
courageously place himself on record
with an estimation of the number of
bids which will be extended and of
the number which will be accepted.
“Smart; money” could do well by back-
ing any ﬁgures Biddle releases, as
his batting average through the last
two years has been practically per-
fect. It’s still a cause for general
wonderment how his prophecy hit so
closely last semester. At that time
he estimated that 150 bids would be
extended, and that 65 would be ac-
cepted. Actual returns from rushing
season showed that 156 bids were ex-
tended. and acceptances totaled 64.

blue outﬁt, Muriel Dils in black vel-
veteen pants and coat, and Marguerite
Swank in a nifty dark suit with spats,
cane, and bowler.

The usual display of prosaic mascu-
line attire suggested that more than
one Pitt boy friend was spending a
quiet evening at home.

Crocheted berets, sunbonnets, tur-
bans, and brimmed hats of blue and
gold crepe paper, were worn by fresh-
men at the Grand March.

After a great deal of elimination
and discussion by the board of judges.
Mrs. Francis Tracy, instructor in
physical education, announced that
the ﬁnal judging would be made by
the audience. Virginia Williams, C37,
in a hat atopped by a miniature
cathedral, and Mildred Thomas, C37,
wearing a sailor hat with blue eagle
and N. R_ A. emblem, were awarded
gingham dogs as having the most
original hats.

There was dancing to the music
of Jean Wald and her orchestra, re-
freshments, for those who were near
enough to the table when the punch
was brought in. And a grand time
was had by everyone but the little
blonde senior who borrowed her
broth/er’s suit—but forgot the sus-
penders.

Engineers Have
Final Elections

Recount Demanded By Industrial
Seminar; Holbrook Vindicated

Final elections took place last
Thursday in all engineerfing seminars.
In all of the groups the president was

chosen from the senior class, the vice

president from the junior class, the,
secretary, from any class in the;
group, and a senior and a junior rep-
resentative to the Engineering Asso-l
ciation. I

When the results were counted for
the industrial engineers they seemed’
to be too nearly perfect for Mt. Stude-
baker, instructor in the department,
and he conducted a recount. As Mr.
Studebaker said, it was not that he
did not trust John Brookﬁeld Hol-
brook IE34, who counted the votes
ﬁrst, it was merely that the vote
looked suspicious. That these sus-
picions were unfounded was proved
when the results of the revote coin-
cided exactly with the ﬁrst vote.
Those elected were Kenneth Steele,
IE34, president; Robert E. Welter-
shausen, IE35, vice president; and
Charles P, Engleﬁeld, IE35, secretary.

Those who will conduct the chem-
ical engineering seminar throughout
this coming year are Harold Wood,,

ChE34, president; Eugene Hoyet,
ChE35, secretary; Harold Mahoney,
ChE34, representative; and Eugene

Hoyet, representative.

Officers of the Electrical engineer-
ing seminar are: Robert Weesner,
EE34, chairman; Russel Ochsenhirt,
EE34, vice chairman; George E. Kol-
ler, EE34, secretary; and Charles M.
Harmish, EE33, representative.

Elections in the civil engineering
seminar are held with the thought in
mind of breaking in juniors for exec-
utive positions when they are seniors,
There are three vice presidents; two
seniors and one junior. The officers
are: Wm. R. Havlak, CE34, presi-
dent; Oliver Tafel, CE34, vice presi-
dent; ‘Harold A_ Schaill, CE34, vice
president; George R. Gray, CE35, vice
president; Charles R. Decker, CE35,
treasurer; Clifford E. Burnett, CE34,
secretary, The representatives to the
Engineering Association are Havlak
and Grey.

Meetings of the seminars take place
the ﬁfth periods on Thursday after-
noons. Attendance ls open to all in-

of women, is the faculty adviser.

Exam To Show Psychological
Prowess Of New Students

 

The freshman psychological test, an
examination taken by Pitt freshmen
and junior college students annually,
will take place Thursday afternoon at
3:45 o’clock, Omar C. Held, Co1leg9
personnel assistant, announced today.

Freshmen in the College are to
meet in Memorial hall banquet room,
pre-education freshmen in room 301
Alumni hall, and Business Adminis-
tration freshmen in room 315 Alumni
hall, Tests will also be given at the
same time in the junior colleges at
Johnstown and Erie.

While not venturing to make any

prowess of the class of '37, Dr. Held
pointed out that last year’s freshman
group had a signiﬁcantly higher test
average than that of the preceding
class.

‘Tests Demonstrate 177

ts Entering Women Rank
In “A” Group

 

Results of the physical examina-
tions being conducted by Dr. Auleene
M. Jamison of the student health de-
gyartment show that this year's fresh-
man women have the largest “A”
group and the smallest restricted
group the University has ever had.
In addition, the general health level
.of the entire group is the highest the
University has known.

Among the 236 freshmen examined
to date only four are in the restricted
;,group. These girls will take no more
than mild corrective exercises. They
are required to spend three hours a
—week in the rest room and to do as-
_-signed reading on health subjects.

The enrollment of the regular “C”
group has 14 members who will par-
ticipate in archery. golf, quoits,
-croquet, and ping-pong. The ‘-‘B"
group are girls who have slightly be-
low average health. They will play
such games as handball, dancing,
“badminton, baseball, tennis and tene-
quoit.

Good health stamps the 177 mem-
hers who are in the “A” group. Their
activity list includes speedball, soc-
cer, hockey, basketball, and track.

For the ﬁrst time in its history, the
University is conducting a required
physical examination of transfer stu-
dents. To date 36 have been exam-
ined. This examination has nothing
to do with gymnasium work, but has
been instituted to protect the health
of these students,

After remaining for the month of
September to assist in freshman
‘health examinations, Mrs. Stevenson
Schmidt, nurse in Dr. Jamison’s of-
ﬁce, has resigned because of a change
of residence. Miss Pauline Thatcher,
13. graduate of Passavant hospital, has
taken Mrs. Schmidt’s place as nurse
of the student health department,

Columbia Professor Talks
Before Pliilological Society

 

Dr. Moses Hadas, professor of Latin
at Columbia University, was guest
speaker of the Philological Society
last Saturday night. His topic was
“The Book of Delight" of Zabara, com-
posed in Barcelona in the twelfth
century.

Dr. Hadas is best known for his
study of Sextus Pompey, the only
modern authoritative study of that
person, which appeared in book form
two years ago.

“The Book of Delight" ﬁrst secured
modern attention in 1827 when the
ﬁrst manuscript was found. Two
others have been found since, but Dr.
Hadas was ﬁrst to issue an authori-
tative text and to translate the work
into English. His text and transla-
tion were recently published by the
Medieval Publications Association of
Columbia University.

 

Dr. Armbruster Announces
3 New Economic Courses

 

The economics department of the
School of Business Administration has
oﬁered this semester, for the ﬁrst
time in its history, graduate courses
in money and banking, municipal
ﬁnance, government and labor. Dr.
Armbruster, assistant dean of the
School of Business Administration, re-
ports that the registration in these
and two other courses, economics of
consumption and economic back-
ground has been very satisfactory. All
the above mentioned courses are
open to both graduate and under-
graduate students,

Sigma Kappa Phi
Meets Tuesday

 

Modern Language Groups
Plan Annual Open House
Event In Future

 

The ﬁrst meeting of the Beta chap-
ter of Sigma Kappa Phi, national hon-
orary language fraternity, will take
place Tuesday, October 17, The ﬁrst
of a series of speakers will be Dr.
Lotte Lohstoeter, assistant professor
of modern languages.

In the near future the annual event
of open house will take place. Pro-
grams will be presented by the
French Club, the German Club, the
Italian Club, the Cosmopolitan, and
the Classical Club.

Beta chapter of Sigma Kappa Phi
was installed at the University of
Pittsburgh in 1921, with ﬁve mem-
bers of the faculty, six seniors and
three juniors as charter members.
The local chapter was formerly
known as Phi Lambda Phi. April,
1926, three chapters of Alpha Zeta
Phi joined with Sigma Kappa Phi.
Among the active members of the lan-
guage fraternity are the majority of
the faculty of the language depart-
ment. Dr. John F. Raschen, professor
and head of the department of mod-
ern languages, is Extension Secretary
of the national chapter.

Many of the large universities that

contain chapters of Sigma Kappa Phi_

are Denver, Utah, Washington, and
Muskingum.

The purpose of Sigma Kappa Phi
is to unite teachers and students
whose attainments are high and
whose aspirations are worthy. The
ﬁrst qualiﬁcations for the fraternity
are notably high grades in some one
foreign language and a good general
average. Membership is restricted
to juniors, seniors and graduate stu-
dents, with a ﬁxed maximum number
of faculty members. Honor keys are
given annually to the outstanding stu-
dent in each language,

WSGA Plans To
Increase Loans

 

 

Raise Money By Tea Dance,
, Beneﬁt Performance,
Candy Stands

 

The student loan committee of
WSGA at its ﬁrst meeting dis-
cussed means of raising money to
build up its deﬂated funds. Tenta-
tive plans were made for a tea dance
and a beneﬁt performance to take
place later in the semester.

According to present arrangements
the beneﬁt performance will take
place at Hotel Schenley and will be
in the form of an All-Pitt Night fea-
turing a movie, and entertainment by
the various organizations on campus,
men’s quartet, Pitt Players, and glee
clubs. Incidentally, the idea of a
beneﬁt performance is not a new
one, having been tried with great suc-
cess in 1928 at which time $165 were
cleared for the loan fund.

Panthers Face Strong Navy
Team In First Big Grid Tesl:

p.-jj-_-

With the W&J and West Virginia University games history the

Panthers are now faced with one of the biggest tests of their season
.-—Saturday’s game with the Navy.

There ’s no doubt about it.

The Middies are going to be tough.

Thus far this season they have played two games, against William
and Mary and Mercer, and have won both. They defeated the latter
team 25 to 6, one touchdown better than the Army was able to do.

The Navy team will be compose-:19

for the most part of veterans. Only
three stars from last year's team were
lost through graduation. These were
“Soupy” Cambell at fullback, Captain
Reedy at left guard, and “Killer” Kane
at right tackle. Last year's Navy
team was inexperienced. Since then
it has played Princeton, Pennsyl-
Vania, Columbia, Notre Dame, and
Army. ..Certainly inexperience will
not hold the Middies back this sea-
son.

The Navy team will probably line
up for the game Saturday with Mur-
ray and Mandelkorn at the ends,
Brooks and C. H. Clark at the tackles,
Zabriskie and Johnston at the guards,
Harbold at center, Becht at quarter-
back, Chung-Hoon and Walkup at the
halfbacks, and W. Clark at fullback.

Standouts on the Navy team are
Captain “Fid” Murray, “Butch” Har-
bold, and Gordon Chung-Hoon.

Murray, the left end, has been a.
standout since he ﬂrst broke into the
varsity lineup. He weighs 187 pounds
and is fairly fast for a big fellow.
He can “take it” and probably will

see as much playing time this fall as"

anyone on the team with the possible
exception of "Butch’ Harbold,

Big “Butch Harbold is a standout
at center. A dependable snapper-back
and a whole backﬁeld on defense, the
Butch’s work has made him the strong-
est center Navy has had in many
years.

Gordon Chung-Hoon is the most col-
orful player on the team. He is a na-
tive Hawaiian and is very fast as are
most of his race. He is one of the
most deceptive ball handlers in col-
legiate football. but is handicapped
somewhat by being too much of an
individualist. Sometimes he doesn’t
pay much attention to his interfer-
ence and is consequently thrown for
9. loss.

“Lou” Little, Columbia coach, at
the Army-‘\Iavy game last year is
supposed to have said that the Navy
was going to be tough to beat in
1933. Well, it is now 1933!

Mountaineers Drop Decision For
Fifth Successive Year;
Pitt Line Outstanding

 

Weinstock Scores Early

 

MOR.-GANTOWN, W. Va., Oct. 7—
Showing improvement in every re-
spect over their playing of last Sat-
urday, the Panthers this afternoon de.
feated a hard-ﬁghting West Virginia
University team, 21 to 0, at the Mount-
aineer stadium.

The game was anything but all Pitt.
Twice the Mountaineers drove the
Panthers into their own territory, and
once in the first quarter blocked and
recovered Hogan’s punt on the two-
yard line. At the end of four downs,
however, they were still on the two-
yard line.

The ﬂrst touchdown was scored in
the ﬁrst quarter as the result of a 60-
yard drive by the Panthers. After
Sebastian, Weinstock, and O’Dell had
alterated in carrying the ball to the
West Virginia four-yard line, Sebas-
tian fumbled over the goal line and
“Izzy” Weinstock, fullback for the
Panthers, recovered for the touch-
down.

The other Panther touchdowns were
scored by O’Dell and Weisenbaugh.
Soon after the start of the third
quarter the Panthers staged an im-
pressive drive up the ﬁeld, ending in
O’Dell ripping off right tackle for
eight yards and a touchdown. A 17-
yard pass, Sebastian to O’Dell, helped
considerably in the drive. Later in
the third quarter, after Thomas had
punted over the goal line, Weisen-
baugh, in the game in place of Wein-
stock, raced oif right tackle for 80
yards and a touchdown. Rooker
nudged Allen away as the West Vir-
ginia safety man tried to force Weis-
enbaugh out of bounds.

The Panthers had a perfect average
in kicking points after touchdown.
Weinstock with two and Onder with
one from placement accounted for
three out of three.

Well, the Panthers didn't look so
bad against the Mountaineers, Es-
pecially was the blocking and passing
improved. Twice, once in the ﬁrst
quarter and once in the third, the
Golden Cats staged impressive touch-
down drives. In both the Panther
blockers were consistently getting the
West Virginia end and tackle out of
the play. In case anybody asks you
this sometimes helps the ball carrier.

O’Dell looked like a real ball carrier
in scoring his touchdown in the third
quarter. He ripped off right tackle,
and when I say ripped I mean ripped.
He also made a very nice catch of
Sebastian’s very nice pas-s in the third

period.

Some of the boys in the press box
were playing Nick Kliskey up as being
another “Bob” Peck. When he tackles
them they go down. He is reported to
have put the lights out for Warren
Heller with a vicious tackle, last year

‘-in practice.

The play of the Panther and West
Virginia players wasn’t exactly gentle.
Shotwell had the back of his jersey
ripped, and showed a red streak across
his back where some playmate spiked
or ﬁnger-nailed him.

This is not meant, however, to im-
ply that either or both teams played
“’dirty.” It was just a hard-fought

battle.

derful meals were served, and what!-
those dear little boys did to that West-
Virgmia cooking was murder, One"
trombone player is reported to have:
eaten 12 hot biscuits at one sitting.
About 12 trombonists probably are‘
ltgqking guilty now if they have read

IS.

The heavy dinner served the boys
must have inspired them, however,
for they did themselves proud in‘
forming the letters WVU in between
halves at the game.

At the game it seemed the style for
some of the West Virginian rooters
to go about carrying canes, wearing
derbies and a sort of gown usually re-
served for the boudoir. We are in-
formed by the managing editor of
this sheet that the boys dressed in
this mananer are members of Pi
Betta Kappa, a men's club at West
Virginia.

Also at the game were the white-
coated pre-meds who entertained the
spectators at the half with a bur’-
lesque on the game of football, with
a group of bloomer-clad boys, also tak-
ing part. It actually was amusing.

The Panthers in the West Virginia‘.
game followed the ball much better
than they did in the W. & J .game, This
was undoubtedly in part because the
Mountaineer attack wasn’t so decep-
tive, but it was also because the West
Virginia players, unlike good old Hank
Day's boys, did not have something’
the color of the ball sewed on the
shoulders of their jerseys. Anything
the color of the ball on any part of the‘
player's uniform, incidentally, is for-
bidden. How about it, Hank?
