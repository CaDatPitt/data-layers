. _’BY GENE GRABOWSKI

The START-UP, drive by Pitt
students to inﬂuence the General
Assembly’s decision on Pitt fund-
ing was ineffective, three members
of the state legislature said
yesterday.

The legislators, all members of
either the Senate or the House
appropriations committees and
residents of Allegheny county, the
letter writing campaign waged by
Pitt students in April did almost
nothing to influence the delibera-
tions on the state education budget
now in progress. '

“The letters were not beneﬁ-
cial,” Senator Edward Early said.

Pitt with jeopardizing the status of
the program by selecting Dr. Jane

“Dr. Harris is not the best

Stone contended. “She’s a junior
level candidate by Pitt’s, own
standards and has only taught for
two years at universities.”

Stone also emphasized that
Harris is not ainative Slav.

He warned that political pressure

unit. a
The over-all trend of the
testimony aimed at disputing‘ a
University contention -that chair-
men are supervisory personnel and
should be excluded.

AAUP testimony, directed by

"representative Ray Richmond,

centered on the process of
appointment of chairmen by faculty
consensus, and their responsibil-
ities. .
According to AAUP witness Seth
Spaulding, ‘a professor and former
chairman in the School of Educa-
tion, the role of chairmen reﬂects

speciﬁcally the wishes of the

faculty at large. 4 .
Spaulding noted the recent black
studies department crisis in which
a chairman without the support of
faculty was forced to step down, to
back the AAUP contention of
chairman accountability.
University ' lawyers have at-
tempted to demonstrate in cross-
examination throughout the week

that chairmen act as administrators v

in their duties with departmental
budgets, faculty promotions, curri-
culum management and division of
workload. ‘ .
In other testimony, AAUP
witness ‘Jacob Cohen, professor of
economics at Pitt, related the
efforts of the AAUP to inﬂuence
the 'University’s ‘salary policy
;through- research and publication of

      
  

    

 
   

University as a result of Harris’

appointment. i
“Since Pitt chooses to ignore

Slavic leaders who represent about

-40—%— of Pittsburgh’-s population,” _
Stone, said. ‘.‘We are going to ask I

all Slavic legislators to vote against
any requests made by the
University of Pittsburgh.”

Stone maintained that Pitt’s
choice of chairperson is part of a
plan to phase out the Slavic studies
department.

He added that because ‘of Pitt’s
decision, he will, with the aid of
-other Slavic leaders, work to break
down communication between the
Slavic community and Pitt.

Harris was appointed, according
to FAS Dean Jerome Rosenberg,
chairman of the screening com-
mittee, after an exhaustive 18-
month search involving dozens of
faculty members.

Harris, wife of Jonathan Harris
of Pitt’s political science «depart-
ment, earned her BA from Stanford

tUniversity and her MA and PhD

from Columbia University. In 1959
Harris was employed.by the State
Department in Moscow. She spent
another year in Moscow and one
year in Leningrad.

A24-hr. Visitation Faces Review

BY GARY LAMPENFELD

The 24-hour visitation policy in
campus dorms is under review by

the Ofﬁce of Residence Life _and ~-

representatives of the campus
community, according to Vice-
Chancellor of Student Affairs
Alfred Moye. ’

Moye said he instructed the
Ofﬁce of Residence Life to conduct
the study to get a wide range of in
depth views on the 24-hour policy,
initiated in the fall of 1971. He said
his major concern was whether
students would demonstrate the
same willingness to accept the
responsibilities associated with the
policy that they demonstrated
when the system began. '

“The legislators were well aware of
Pitt’s ﬁnancial needs. We were
already dedicated toward giving it
as much money as we could.”

House member
Geisler said the mass of letters he
received reﬂected no knowledge of
the situation by individual stu-
dents.

“The letters were sent out on a
mass basis,” Geisler said. “It was
plain to see ‘students, were told to
write and demand more funds, but
they didn’t know or understand the
facts of their school’s or the state’s
budget.” .

Geisler added that the legislative
assembly will make its budgetary

decision on the basis of facts‘

presented by University officials in
Harrisburg.
Senator Eugene F. Scanlon, a

Pitt alumnus, recalled he was

struck by the apparent lack of
sincerity and "sameness of the
START-UP letters.

view. “There is so little
response,” he said, “it disturbs me
that students may not really be
interested in the issue of 24-hour
visitation. ’ ’

Moye said the study of the
24-hour policy overlaps with a
review of the security system.
“Since we’re reviewing our secur-
ity system and since 24-hour
visitation certainly poses a security
problem,” he said, “security is a
major factor in this study.”'

The study~group format would
comprise committees of about nine
members each, who would express
their opinions on the matter.
“Study groups be more in depth,
more concrete than a‘ question-
naire, ’ ’ Moye said.

“Dr. Harris is a developing
young scholar,” Rosenberg added,
“who wants to have a program that
will relate to the community,
desires improving the Slavic
department as a whole.”

Ludmila Koehler, associate pro-
fessor in the Slavic department,
was another candidate considered
by the screening committee.
Koehler was a senior level
candidate, is a native Slav, and was
favored by Slavic leaders for the
position, Stone said. ‘

Stone said the University did not
give adequate consideration to the
Slavic leaders’ opinions concerning
the appointment.

According to a member of the
Greek Catholic Union, which was a
part of the Slavic delegation, “We
were not given any voice in the
decision. Pitt officials simply told
us who they appointed and didn’t
even hear what we had to say.”

i Rosenberg, however, maintained
that Slavic leaders were given the
opportunity to make their opinions
known to the screening committee
and to Chancellor Wesley Posvar.

Student Support
Asked by RSA

Approximately 3‘/2 years ago the
issue of 24-hour visitation became a
focus of concern for both students
and administrators in the Resid-
ence Halls. Men's Dorm Council
and Women’s Housing Board both
informed the administration of
student support for this policy. In
November of 1971, 2,450 students,
out of 2,552 voting, voiced their
support for the institution _of
24-hour visitation rights.

The policy was instituted. with
the expectation that students would
accept the kind of responsibilities
which accompany such a policy.
Students voiced their willingness to
conduct themselves in such a
manner as not to jeopardize the
rights of other students living in
the residence balls. The policy
functioned under .a provision of
local option. The students in each
living area voted on their own
visitation hours. This practice is
still in effect.

Very recently, this policy has
again bec_ome the focus of
administrative concern. They
question whether the freedom this
policy are even more far-reaching
(damages, crime, etc.)
to examine -the full effects of the
institution of this policy the Office
of Residence Life is organizing an
in-depth study. The resulting
report will be sent to the Board of
Trustees.

Student participation in this
study is obviously of vital import-
ance, yet very few students have
replied. The purpose of the study
groups is not to determine whether
24-hour visitation will be continu-
ed, but to access its -effects upon

    ’ Letter

ljpivetph and Taketh Away Grapelandé Artful Dodger

On Tuesday, May 6, the Pitt
News carried a Gallo response by
Joshua Simons to a Letter to the
Editor by Mike Kelly.

It is amazing that in over 1,300
words, Simons spends only ‘one
paragraph on the central issue in
the UFW boycott of Gallo wines--
whether or not Gallo farm workers
were consulted as to Gallo’s switch
of unions. After fleeting the issue,
Simons goes on to quote articles,
sections and subsections from his
Teamster “contract” in an attempt
to confuse and bore the average
person who has little understand-
ing of contract language, and more

importantly, little understanding of .-

the transference of language into

effective enforcement on the job.

To rebut the contract point by point
would be inane, and would be a
replay of Gallo’s confuse and dodge
tactics. Actions speak louder than
words. The effectiveness of the
Gallo-Teamster sweetheart con-
tract can be evidenced by the brutal
fact that within the space of 3

weeks, this past April, THREE -

FARM WORKERS DIED at Gallo’s
Livingston ranch; two were elec-
trocuted by a “labor saving
device” and one was crushed to
death in a tractor accident. In the 6
years Gallo was under UFW
contract, not one fatal accident

occured at Gallo’s Livingston
Ranch.

Simons also fails to mention -

certain pertinent information sur-
rounding the“ signing of the
Gallo-Teamster contract: 1) When
the UFW-Gallo contract expired,
Gallo refused to extend the UFW

contract protections on a day to day

basis, while negotiations contin-
ued. (A_ common ’union-manage-
ment practice here and nation-
wide.) 2) Cesar.Chavez’ repeated

requests for an election were
denied by Gallo. (May 16, ’73 -
Cesar sent telegram to Gallo
requesting immediate supervised
elections if he doubted UFW
represented workers. May 21,
local newspapers Fresno, Modesto
and Sacremento Bees made Ce-
sar’s request public.) 3) Gallo’s‘
contract with the Teamsters was
signed 13 days after a majority of
Gallo’s permanent workers walked
out on strike. (Strike on June 27,
’73 certified by Employment
Development Dept., State of
California - Health and Welfare
4) Gallo farm workers
were so happy to be Teamsters that
Gallo went to court to evict over
70 families from the labor camps
after they joined the strike. Were
Gallo’s farm workers consulted
about the union switch? Just ask
the striking Gallo workers who are
organizing the Gallo Boycott in Los
Angeles, San Francisco and
throughout California.

It is unfortunate that the Pitt
News, bytitling Gallo’s response
“Laws to Protect Farm Workers”,
unintentionally promoted Gallo"s
repressive tactics. The title gives a
false authority or credence to
Gallo’s stand on legislation. The
title gives the impression that we
should take Simons word that he
knows what is’ best for farm
workers. What makes Simons and
Gallo authorities on this subject?
How many years of poverty,
hunger, degradation, bureaucratic
callousness and powerlessness
have they suffered? How many
years have they worked ,in the
ﬁelds?

legislation, one needs to under-
stand who Gallo is.’ Gallo. is the

not once have they fought for child
labor outlaws on the farm,

Paroohiaid: Blow to

BY PETE BUTCH

The US Supreme Court recently
declared unconstitutional a Penn-
sylvania legislative act that subsi-
dized parochial school students.

It was the opinion of the court
that the Pennsylvania acts violated,
the First Amendment.

The First Amendment states:
“Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free
exercise thereof...” .

This amendment prohibits Con-
gi'ess' establishment of an official
church for the United States or
interference with the free exercise
of religion. Our founding fathers
came to the colonies in part to
escape the " intolerant sta'te-sup-
ported churches of some European
countries. With.this amendment
they hoped to prevent something
similar happening in the United
States.

When the government subsi-
dizes a group, the group usually
falls under the control or influence
of its benefactor. The best example
of this is the University itself. Once
Pitt accepted state aid in the
mid-60s it became responsible to
the state. Not just fiscally, to
paraphrase an old saying; “When
Harrisburg sneezes, Pitt catches
pneumonia.” ~ ‘

So if the state gives aid to
parochial schools, it represent two
dangers to the separation of church
and state. One is that the

distribution of money will not be ‘

equal to _all denominations, in
effect setting up an <_)fﬁcial’state
religion. The other is that once

. these parochial schools are depen.- .
,..,dent upon state aid, thethreat .of . r
;d|SC_9ntinuati_0n...of.-{state aid ‘.—éx"i§t“s '

 

should the school teach or do
anything against state wishes.
Some may object to the Supreme
Court decision on the grounds that
the schools pose no threat to the
separation of church and state on
their part, since they will have no
say in government. But actually

this ruling will prevent Pennsyl-»

vania from interfering with paro-
chial school matters.

Ideally, any church in the United
States should be allowed to
operated a parochial school--and
they can--if they can afford to. This
is where a state subsidy comes in.

Some may object to parochial
schools on the grounds that their

05¢-0'>¢?=0><-05¢-0&05<-05

 

will restrict and crush farm
unionizing, especially the UFW.
Gallo is as interested in fair
legislation for farm workers, as a
coal operator is in health and safety
laws for coal miners, and as a coal
stripper is in land reclamation
laws.

Gallo’s stand on legislation and’

the response "letter is so racist that
it is important to make everyone
aware of it. (Racism is inherent to
the farm workers struggle.) Gallo
found...that these contract clauses
were offensive...to the farm work-
ers and us...We felt that our farm
workers should have the same
rights...” Since only Gallo knows

.what union is best for his workers,

he gave them. a union. Since only
Gallo knows what laws and rights
are best for his farm workers, we
should vote for his legislation.
Only Gallo-knows what is ‘best for
his poor, poor farm workers. V

Let us not fall into the racist trap
that Gallo is laying by supporting
his legislation, or by thinking that
we know what is best for farm
workers. Farm workers are
intelligent human beings who can
judge for themselves which union
and which legislation is best for

them. If we listen, they are telling

us how to help them. All they are
asking for is the basic democratic
right of elections, so that they may
build their own future. _ Gallo
refused elections in May of 1973
and is still refusing. The boycott is
the one election he .can’t stop.

Cesar Chavez has said, “We are
willing to test the will of the Gallo
workers -in a secret ballot election.
If we lose we will call off the Gallo
strike and boycott; we will make

that agreement in advance; we will .

execute it in writing in a form that
can be enforced in court. We will
put up a $1 million performance
bond to remove any doubts about
our intentions.” o
Is that to much to ask?

Blood, Sweat & Tears B

BY KEN MINARIK

The powerful jazz-rock group Blood, Sweat & Tears has just
completed a 10-day engangement at the Holiday House, the famed
supper club in nearby Monroeville. Joining the group for the 20-show
engagement was. a face synonymous with BS&T music--David Clayton-
Thomas. _ ‘ _

After a seemingly endless separation_ that ended in two ﬂat albums
forthe group and an unsuccessful solo shot for Thomas, BS&T is once .
again bringing packed houses to their feet, as it plays its way through
set after set of jazz, often laced with good ol’ rockpand roll.

The band undoubtedly is more powerful than ever, and its handling
of such rockers as “Got To Get You Into My Life” and “Ride Captain
Ride” shows BS&T will be the innovative force to be reckoned with in
the late 1970s.

The band’s sound remains distinctly its own, and even when
performing old standards like “Spinning Wheel” and “And When I
Die,’’. it manage to showcase the explosive talents of its individual jazz
musicians. ’

Jazz is really what BS&T is all about: Less than a_ third of the
group’s Monroeville engagement was devoted to Thomas’ vocals. In
an exclusive interview with the Pitt News, Thomas talked about the
band and its jazz influences. I '

Pitt News: The first thing I want to say, David,’ is that I don’t plan
on asking any ofthose standard interview-type questions. _Why did you
leave the group? Was there any hostility involved...and whose idea
was the solo career?

Thomas: “A lot of people have the wrong impression--I did not
leave the band. Five members left the band at that time. As far as
reasons are concerned, it was a matter of exhaustion and nerves. We
had just finished touring and my voice was shot. I’d- almost ruined my
voice by playing those arenas and hockey stadiums where you have to
scream.” '

Pitt News: Well, considering that you want to sell albums and I
want to sell newspapers, let's talk about your new album, New City.
Do you have any thing to say about the album that would-make a Pitt
News reader buy it‘? '

Thomas: “No. That's a matter of personal choice. If you want me
to say something llike, ‘I enjoyed working on the album,’ I can do
that...." '

Pitt News: That seems to be the standard-type answer.

Thomas: V “And I guess that’s what you want. I am about 80%
satisﬁed with the new album--and that's about 30% more than
anything we’ve done before.” .

Porter is the classic case of a
human being born out of his time.
A man who, with a sophisticated
shrug of the shoulders, refuses to
accept death, love and life.

Because Porter is without the
blessing of 20th Century insensi-
tivity, his suffering and frustration
twist him into a monster, one of
those above’-the-drugstore-apart-
ment monsters who scar everything
they touch. _»

Confronted with the trap society
has built around him and aware of
the pain which his torture is
creating, Porter achieves salvation
through excape into fantasy, a
return to the peaceful, insulated
squirrels-and-bears game that he
and his ‘wife play.

This is Anger’s skeleton. The
very essentials of action. .

The interpretation by directo
Dick imennen is successful at
avoiding the pitfalls of revivals. .

Mennen and his associates
worked back from the “idea” of the
play, striving to make it more
cerebreal and timeless. The stage
is white planks, the furniture and
props are bleached as if they had
been subject to a kind of spiritual
erosion. There is a parched, desert
quality to the room in which the
play moves, a bone-white sterility
in which only the actors present
recognizable life. a V

immediately come to mind (and
(heart) is Kuhns’ “mouse dance.”
Both characters relieve as well as
mount the tide of tension.

Anger’s director, Dick Mennen
tiptoes across a ﬁne line. He does
little to overcome the tediousness
of a one-room “talky” play. And
yet he handles the role of character

Anyone who ever read Buchwald
knows his style:
essays on politics or business,
which must sear their way into the
hearts and minds of their victims
like a branding iron into a calf’s
hide. The essays probably leave
the same kind of mark, too.

If you enjoy reading Buchwald in

a black void, slightly askew from
the real world, an isolated planet
where the inhabitants are gripped
by a relentless gravity, a force to
which there is no petition. _

Porter's wife Allison, played by
Kate Young, is the subject of
Porter’s attacks. She is literally
wracked and physically weakened
by his constant haranguesr against
her and her middle class parents.

Young’s performance is the
wonderful event of the perfor-
mance. There is a very real quality
to her movement and expression

that deny the audience any excape
from the role of witness to the
spiritual agony of a young woman.

Cliff, played by David Kuhns, is
the go-between, a buffer between
Porter and his wife who keeps the
relationship from ﬁnal disintegra-
tion. He must witness the decay of
Allison’s and Porter's spiralling
descent into complete internal
consumption.

Porter, theromantic, the hys-
teric, the corner p_ub poet, isiplayed
by William Wendt, and it is his
portrayl that gives a hesitation to
the viewer.

David Clayton Thomas’
B, S & T Returns to Pgh,

(Continued from Page 5)

this band started out to be--a bunch of talented jazz musicians that
used to play together in Greenwich Village.” /

Pitt News:
’ Thomas:

What’s next for this ‘band? p
‘fOur next project is a double album of live material. _ I

think that a live album will give people a better chance to find out what

we’re about.

Blood, Sweat & Tears is ajazz band.”

Pitt News: There’s.a song on the new album--you played it tonight,

too--called -“Witness to a War.”

Needless to say, it is a really

dynamite song, and the audience was really moved. Will it be a single?

Thomas:
it’s over five minutes long.

“I don’t know. “Witness to a War” is a great song, but
If a song is over three ‘minutes long,

three-fourths of the stations in this country won’t play it. And- you’re
certainly not going to cut a song like ‘that to make it three minutes.
‘ Once again, we're talking about the bias against this band and against

AM radio.

Write what you want to write.”

With a drink in his -hand and the sweat from an evening’s
performance beading on his brow, David Clayton_Thomas had enough
talk for the evening. In less than an hour, the band was going to do its
final set--an 11 pm show--before hitting the road. '

The next stop on the road is Evanston_, Illinois, where another page
-will be written in the story of the rebuilding of Blood, Sweat & Tears.

Osborne’s Porter is sole char-
acter with emotion. Stripped of
polite, numbing conventions, he
burns brighter than the other
characters, sinks lower andsuffers
more.

Wendt’s Porter seems to edge
towards the point at which the
viewer would reject him as a
believable character. The progres-
sion of the play adaptsthe audience
to his super-human movements,
Wendt’s portrayal mellows. The "
initial incongruity, however, serves
as an irritant that effects the

” ‘‘reality'’ of the play.

The revival of Anger is saved
from the detriment of its ’50s
dialogue and from the over-expo-
sure some of its surfact elements
have received in the media of the
’60s and '70s: I slow death,
obscenity, promiscuity and preg-
nancy.

The revival works because of the
twist created by director Mennen
and the stage design directors.
The play is presented in a more
ghostly, visionary surrounding that
preserve the voice of the work, V-.-.
stripped of the dated baggage of“ T
’50s England, ‘

And the voice of the work Look
Back In Anger simply suggests that
is a culture (be it ’50s or ’70s) that
deprives us of courage, challenge
and good causes, we must turn to
each other.

Porter and Allison shed them-
selves of reality in an agonizing
process of self-exploration,and
they become saints. Beyond the
touch of the ghetto, a crushing,_
airless society or the anxiety of

‘ empty‘ stomachs.

‘Nolan's’ Land  

 following summer.

BY RICK SHRUM

Over the past two years the
professional career of Gary Nolan
existed purely in a baseball limbo
known as the Disabled List.

Sore-shouldered and forlorn,
Nolan pitched twice for the
Cincinnati Reds during the ’73
campaign and not at all the
Last May, a
calcium spur was removed from his
right shoulder--that precious right
shoulder that \ had» served as
operator of the then-omnipotent
Big Red Machine.

Nolan, 27, cherubic, baby-faced,
placid as a thank-God-I’m-a-
country-boy, wasn’t expected to

\ return to even a semblance of his

previous excellence. He wasn’t
expected to return, period.

Yeah. Tell that to the Pirates,
whom he defeated 8-4 Tuesday
evening at Three Rivers Stadium
for his ﬁfth victory against three
losses. I

But don’t tell that to Nolan. All

;“".,1that transpired over ’73-’74 resides

f—‘

in the outer recesses of his mind,
for the past is not his domain; the
present and future are. .

“I don’t like to talk of the past,”
Nolan said after stomach cramps
forced him from the mound in the
‘seventh inning. “I ‘had a feeling
last winter "things would be all
right, and during spring training I

V KNEW just that”,

Working the corners superbly--
he struck out five, walked only one,
granted four runs and six hits to a
team with a non-defense that
negated its might--Nolan . scaled
another rimg on the comeback
ladder with an abundance of help
from his friends. .

_ There was Joe Morgan, second‘
‘baseman, the ﬁreplug-sparkplug of y

the white-hot Red Machine.

Morgan ripped three hits, foremost
a bases-loaded triple with two out
in the fourth that opened the

, Double play.

previously tight 3-1 Red advantage -

over Bob Moose (0-2).

Yet, at the finish, it was
Morgan’s eyes that proved most
valuable to the National West
leaders.

Dave Parker, who sizzled his
sixth homer, of the year during the
Pirate second, led off the ninth with
a right-center gap double. Richie
Zisk,- making his first start in a
week, followed with a shot at the

-centerfield wall that maple-

fingered Cesar Geronimo snared
magnificently at the apex of his

' leap while he kissed the 400 mark.

Parker tagged and advanced to
third...but didn’t. Morgan ap-
pealed that Parker had left second
early, which was the ruling.

“Parker was just off -the bag
when the ball was caught,”
Morgan said. “I don’t think he

knew he. was off--it was only about ~

six inches.
“I was watching...that’s my job.
The umpire’s supposed to be
watching--that’s his job, too. And
he did it.”
Aside from~ the heroics of
Morgan and Geronimo and the

benefits of the howitzers that all

but obliterated statically erratic
Moose, Nolan was rendered
assistance by reliever Will McEn-

‘any [one hit over last three innings]

and the notorious combat-tattered
Pirate gloves. ~

Ah, the Buc defense...described
as a contemporary matador--where
fielders wave while thrown and
batted balls go past. ‘

Prior to Tuesday's fray, the
Pirates were guilty of only one
error in_ six games--ﬁve wins.
Tuesday, however, was somewhat
more typical. Like three errors, a
balk and two hits on which
pitchers failed to cover first quickly
enough. '  I

There was Duffy Dyer letting a‘

relay squirt through his legs at the

plate; Moose almost picking off _

IllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllIlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllﬁ 

llllllllllllliﬁ

The I
Pitt News

George Foster at second base, only
to throw into centerfield, a-blunder
that eventually cost three runs;
Richie Hebner dropping a fielder’s
choice throw at third. ‘

And more. Sam McDowell
balking; McDowell not making it to
first before Morgan on a bouncer to
Willie Stargell; Moose doing the
same. ‘

“Those were deﬁnitely the faults
of the pitchers,” said Buc Manager
Danny Murtaugh. “The pitcher's
got to beat the" runner to the bag.
Both times the runner got there.”

Yet despite the flaws, Murtaugh
remains steady in his rocker
[literally]. The offense is puny, but

"is building. The "bench is proving

solid, efﬁcient. Excepting ailing
Ken Brett and Dock Ellis, the
starting pitching is good..

The defense, well...

However, the prospectus of the
Pirates is glowing. They’re just
behind the Chicago Cubs in the NL
East, even though boppers Zisk
and Hebner‘ both have amassed

onlyone homer and 10 RBIs. over‘

the first quarter of the season; even
though only one pitcher ‘ (Bruce
Kison) has more than four
victories‘; even though no one -save
Dave Parker is batting in runners.

With Bill Robinson. and Art

Howe and Duffy Dyer and Ed‘

Kirkpatrick around, Pittsburgh
CAN wait for its cylinders to begin
operating.

But not if Gary Nolans continue
emerging from the pitching staffs
of the National League...

Common Sense and how does it fit

_ Common Sense has the worst
faults of the earlier albums without
their redeeming features. The rock

more tastelessly than in the past.
There’s a full sound--but it’s trite
and cliched. Doesn’t anyone ever
tire of dragging out the perfunctory
steel guitar and horn section?

You can’t blame the slick
production for all of the album’s
weaknesses, however. It wouldn’t
be offensive if thelyrics were
better. Most of the songs are

perceptive lyrics--but I’ve heard
them once too often.

This album is a real disap-
pointment.— In his albums and
concert Prine has. shown he is one
of the best singers and writers
aroiind. But his original voice- has

been drowned’ under an electric
mess. On Sweet Revenge it
bothered me because he still had a
lot to say. But there’s not much of
a voice to drown anymore. I hope
that next time Prine returns to his
high quality, reﬂecting growth
instead of complacency. Common
Sense just. doesn’t make sense.

KEN BRETT, expected to be one of the workhorses of thel'-Pirate
pitching staff, hasgbeen plagued with injuries most of the season, This“

coupled with an injury to Dock Ellis,.has taken its toll on the Bu_cs.~;
