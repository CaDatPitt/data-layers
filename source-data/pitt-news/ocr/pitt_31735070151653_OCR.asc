Staff I/Vrzifer

A study still under way at a Wash-
ington, D.C., research firm is
testing whether landlords judge
potential-tenants based on race.

This study was the subject of
a lecture Margery Austin Turner,
the senior vice presidentfor pro-
gram planning and management
at The Urban Institute, gave
Thursday on the 20th floor of
the Cathedral of Learning to an
audience of about 100 students
and members of the community.

During the lecture, which
was part of the School of Social
Work’s Center on Race and Social
Problems Speaker Series, Turner
said that The Urban Institute has
worked with the Department of
Housing and Urban Develop-
ment on housing discrimination.

During her lecture, Turner
presented the preliminary ﬁnd-
ings of the study. I

Althoughjon Weston’s charm suit-
ed him well when he was a high-
level executive, he left the corpo-
rate world because he thought big
businesses focus too much on the
bottom line.

“The small business, I just like it
because I have one partner — my
wife,” Weston said.

. Weston, 50, opened his shop,
Katie’s Kandy, on Meyran Street
last week. He has run his original
shop, bearing the same name in-
spired by his youngest daughter,
Katie, in Homestead for the past
3 1/2 years. ‘

-Weston has hired ﬁve Pitt stu- _
dents to staff the new store. He
started looking to expand into ei-
ther Downtown or Oakland about
a year ago.

these candies instead of the M&M’s
and Snickers bars of typical candy
aisles.

“WhatI like the most about it is
that no one comes in here in a bad
mood. Everyone comes in, they’re
happy,” Weston said.

Customers also have their
choice of 225 different bulk candy

items that  be purchased for

items, featuring peach—ﬂavored"

SOFTBALL

Veteran roster prepares for beginning of fall schedule

Megan Boyle
Staﬁ” Wrz'ter

The Pitt softball team will begin its
fall schedule when the Panthers travel
to Canfield, Ohio, to compete in the
Youngstown State Fall Classic. There,
the girls will compete in a double-
header Sunday against Toledo and Kent
State. '

The current Pitt roster is almost
identical to last season’s spring lineup.
The only difference is the newly recruit-
ed freshmen and, of course, the loss of
catcher Holly Stevens to graduation.

“It’s sad not being able to come back
and play with a bunch of girls that I love
so much,” Stevens said. '

The team Stevens played on consist-
ed of many girls who were new to play-
ing at the collegiate level. One of these
players was outﬁelder Tori_ Nirschl.

“My freshman year really showed me
where my weaknesses were, and so this

. summer I focused a lot on those areas,”

Nirschl said.

SPORTS

This year, Nirschl and the rest of the
Panthers’ squad lookto improve upon
their record and overall performance.

The team’s record last season was 19- .

29, having a higher winning percentage
on the road.

With oneseason of play under their
belts, the players now know what to
expect from each other and their indi-
vidual playing capabilities.

“It’s really exciting to play with the
same girls again this year,” Nirschl said.
“We’re already used to the team dynam-
ic, and we’re all really comfortable with
each other and get along really well.”

With this knowledge,.fans should
expect standout performances from
Nirschl and others. Named the Big East
Conference Rookie of the Year last sea-
son, Nirschl led the team in nearly every
offensive category. .

This season she ‘hopes to replicate
these feats going into future games.

“I worked really hard this past sum-
mer,” Nirschl said. “My ﬁelding is a bit
better and hitting_wise,I just want to

Savannah King will serve as another
leader for the team. Last season, King
was dominant on the mound with a bat-
ting average of.229. She also tallied 27

  

hits and 13 RBI at the plate.

Despite the impressive numbers,

FOOTBALL

With Miami’s 21-16 victory over No. 12
Florida, the Hurricanes evened the sea-
son series between the SEC and ACC.
In the first two weeks of the season,
ACC teams took on No.1 Alabama,
No. 10 Florida, No. 5 Georgia and ‘No.
6 South Carolina. Those rankings are
from the Associated Press’ preseason
top 25, but you don’t even need these

numbers to understand the talent of 1
those four schools.

In addition to Miami’s victory over
its in-state rival, Clemson took down
Georgia in the first week.

i The ACC'—— or_at least the upper tier
-— can compete on the national stage
with the country’s premier football

conference.

Here’s this week’s ACC breakdown:

Clemson

After moving up to No. 4 in the AP
poll, the Tigers didn’t let FCS foe South
Carolina State slow them down. Clemson
outgained the Bulldogs in yardage 512
to 241, and Dabo Swinney was able to
pull his starters at halftime as Clemson
cruised to a 52-13 victory.

Miami

The Hurricanes officially cemented
their return to the top of college football
in Florida with their victory over the Ga-
tors. Miami’s defense took the ball away
from Florida five times, making up for
an earlier loss of more than 400 yards.

Florida State _

Sitting atop the ACC with a 1-0 re-
cord, the Seminoles had an early off

. week. FSU faces Nevada, Bethune-Cook-

man, Boston College and Maryland in
its next four games. There’s no reason
the Seminoles won’t be 5-0 headed to
Clemson on’October 19.

North Carolina .

UNC beat Middle Tennessee State
40-20, largely thanks ‘to its defense,
which produced two interceptions when

» the Blue Raiders were inside the Tar

Heels’ 30-yard line. North Carolina run-
ning back Romar Morris turned--only 10
carries into two touchdowns.

Georgia Tech

The Yellow Jackets also took week
two off. They will head to Durham, N.C.,
to take on Duke in the.week’s only ACC
matchup Saturday.

Hundreds of employers to seek applicants at  Career Fair

_ Parthena Mosiades
Staﬁ‘ Wrz'ter

Tatum Walker entered the Petersen
Events Center last fallwith 10 resumés
in her hand, joininga crowd of 200
employers and thousands of students.

Dressed in a blouse andskirt with
matching pumps, Walker said that she
couldn’t help but feel overwhelmed by
her surroundings. ’

Pitt’s Office of Career Development

‘ and Placement Assistance will host the

fall Career Fair on Wednesday, Sept. 25,
from 11 a.rn. to 4 p.m. at the Petersen
Events Center. Cheryl Finlay, Director

' of Career Deyelopment and Student

Employment, said that more than 3,000
students are expected to attend this
year’s fall Career Fair.

Finlay saidthat ‘Pitt has hosted the
fair for several years and that..i;t~ has

been steadily growing insize, ever‘s‘ince.f'

In fact, the event was forced to relo-
cate to the Petersen Events Center in
2008 in order to adjust to the growing
number of employers and students in
attendance. ..

At the fair, students will have the
opportunity to interact with more than
200 recruiters from both local and

national nonprofits and corporations.
Government agencies and graduate
school representatives will also be in
attendance. .

Many of the roughly 200 recruiters
that will be at the "fair arefreturning
from previous years. But Finlay said

i that, of those registered for this year,

about 11 percent are new.

She also said that some organiza-
tions that hire significant numbers of
Pitt students will be returning, includ-
ing UPMC, PLS Logistics, PNC, Financial
Services Group, BNY Mellon, Siemens,
Teach for America, Dick’s Sporting
Goods, American Eagle Outﬁtters, Unit-
ed States Steel Corporation, Macy’s,
Microsoft, Target and Vanguard.

Students who preregister for the
event through the FutureLinks web-
site will be able to view a list of all the
registeredemployers.

Finlay said that one of the most im-
portant things students can do before
the fair is familiarize themselves with
the companies that interest them. She
said that personalizing resumés for

.e these companies is also an important

way to prepare. »
Catherine Taylor, an administrative

assistant at the Grant Street Group, an
organization that specializes, in soft-
ware applications in Pittsburgh, said
that her organization will be attending
the fair and advised students to special-
ize their resumés.

“Take some time to learn about our
company and the position that interests
you before arriving at the fair. Tailor
your questions, answers and resumé to
address that position,” she said.

Taylor said that the Grant Street
Group has made connections with
students as a result of the Career Fair
and has hired eight candidates from
Pitt over the last two years for summer
internships — one of which resulted in
a full-time position after graduation.

She said that in order to help in-
crease a students’ chances of receiving
an interview request'after the fair, they
must follow certain guidelines.

In addition to the background re-
search on companies suggested, Finlay
also stressed the importance of pre-
sentation.

Finlay said that students should ap-
pear both confident and skilled. “Have
a firm and conﬁdent handshake,” she
said.

Some graduates wait before heading to

Danielle Fox
Stajf Writer

In today’s world, the stress ofﬁnding a j ob af-

‘ ter graduation can be enough to make gradu-

ates want to toss up their mortarboard, then

throw it allaway and j oin the circus. Which, if -

approached correctly, would not be the worst
decision some students can make.

Unorthodox post-graduation jobs and
volunteer programs can broaden horizons,
teach real-world life skills and make for a
memorable job interview.

With programs like World Wide Oppor-
tunities on Organic Farms and unusual job-
listing sites like Oddjob Nation, students can
ﬁnd opportunities thatwill take them around
the world and build their resumes for when
their explorations end —— without fetching
a single cup of coffee or ever ﬁling a paper.

Employment development special-

ist Trisha Hyatt from the Office, of Career
Development and Placement Assistance

recommends that students do not initially V

delay ﬁnding a job position in their ﬁeld af-
ter graduation, since time away. from their
ﬁelds makes it harder to secure a job when
they return.

Pittbiology professor Nathan Morehouse.

is an example of someone who took on a
series of unorthodox ﬁrst jobs that can still
lead back to a professional career with the
right mindset.

Morehouse graduated from Cornell Uni-
versity in20o0 with a degree in biology. Dur-
ing his last semester at Cornell, Morehouse
took 18 credits, completed 10 to 20 hours a
week of researchand managed a coffee shop,
among other things.

“I over-worked myself as an undergrad-
uate,” Morehouse said. “I was just kind of
burnt out.’f

.Unsure of whether or not he wanted
to remain in biology, Morehouse did not
pursue graduate school or a job in biology
immediately after graduation. Instead, he

’ boarded a plane to Kodiak Island, Ala., and

immediately began working 140-hour weeks
at a salmon ﬁshery.

It was the adventure he had always
dreamed of, and he was able to take skills
he learned at his ﬁshery job and apply them

» to hiscareer today.

“We worked‘ really, really long hours.
It’s really challenging and you have to learn
stress mechanisms and the capacity to steel
yourself and have strong resolve,” More-
house said. “Those kind of things have been
very helpful for me, because I’ve worked
long hours as a scientist, as well.  [Salmon
ﬁshing] taught me the capacity to persevere

, and work really hard on something thatwas

important.”

Students should also prepare their
elevator speeches for employers, which
brieﬂy explain who they are and what
they want to do.

And while students may enter the
fair withspeciﬁc employers in mind,
Finlay said that they should remember
not to overlook employers based on
their type of business.

“Every organization needs well-
rounded people with transferable skills
and knowledge in such areas as market-
ing, management, education, psychol-
ogy and communications,” she said.

Returning to the Career Fair as a ju-
nior, Walker, a Spanish, psychology and
studio arts major, said that she will ap-
proach organizations that she wouldn’t
have thought to go to last year.

As a result of having experienced the
fair last year as a sophomore, Walker
said that she is excited to attend once
again with a more open mind.

She said that although the fair is
open to all undergraduate and graduate
students, she felt that the event caters
more to juniors and seniors. “Those
are the people that they are ready to
hire,’_’ she said. I

9-to—5 jobs

For students who wish to follow in More-
house’s footsteps, Hyatt said whether or
not going on a similar adventure will hurt
a student in the long run depends on each
individual’s circumstances.

Hyatt used a hypothetical example of a‘

graduate with a degree in marketing pursuing
an unorthodox job, such as salmon ﬁshing
or working on an organic farm. She said if a
student were to keep up on marketing trends
and apply marketing principles to a job at
the ﬁshery or farm, he or she may have little
trouble returning to his or her ﬁeld at the end
of their program.

Hyatt suggested that students should in-
stead volunteer for local organizations and
assist with marketing efforts to stay current
with the ‘industry.

Religion
in the
workplace

Natalie Daher
Assistant News Editor

During a biology II exam in 2010, Raheel
Haque, a sophomore and observant Muslim,
devoted about 10 minutes to pray in a hallway
of Clapp Hall. He got out of his seat, bent head
over heels and prayed evening prayers to Al-
lah while his fellow students ‘hunched over
their papers.

“That time was crucial, but [praying] was
more important than the exam,” he said.
“What hit me is that if I walk out of this lec-
ture hall and get hit by a car, the exam is not
as important. My religion is more important.
This is my obligation to fulﬁll my duty.”

Leaving during an exam was not the only
decision that Haque, former Muslim Student
Association president and2013 graduate, had
to make during his college years at Pitt. Since
Muslims are required to pray ﬁve times a day,
Haque often arrived late for class or was ab-
sent on days outside of the school’s scheduled
holidays. During his senior year, he pushed
administrators tolcreate a multifaith prayer
room in the Union to create a central space
for Muslim students to pray.

“Some professors would be OK with it.
but others wanted more proof or reasoning,”
Haque said regarding his absences on days
including the Eid, which is equivalent to Chris-
tianity’s Christmas.

“I had to be stem with them and tell them,
‘this is my holiday,”’ he said. “One professor
wanted proof that I was going and doing some-
thing during that time. Itwas annoying, butI
understand where he was coming from.” A

According to research from multiple na-
tional organizations, religious diversity is on

the rise in the United States and in the work-
place. For students, the college setting is their
primary workplace. While Christian occasions
monopolize the holiday schedule for compa-
nies and universities, professors and employ-
ers need to adjust policies to accommodate the

Independent artists face tough road to success

1

John Lavanga
A€9’E Editor

Among the many tropes that inhabit the
world of pop culture, few have been quite
as enduring or romanticized as the starving
artist. With nothing but artistic vision, a dirty
studio, alcohol and art supplies, the starving
artist takes a solitary journey toward some
high universal truth found only in art.

This romanticized vision of the7bohe-
mian lifestyle works just ﬁne for ﬁlms and
novels, but the realities of life as an artist
are a bit more complicated than pop culture
leads us to believe. The life of an independent

artist is fraught with difficulties that are far »

more practical than artistic. H
Independent artist and Pitt alumnajulie
Sokolow sees these challenges every day.
Sokolow heads the group Healthy Artists,
which ﬁghts for comprehensive health
care reform in Pennsylvania on behalf of
the state’s independent artists - many of
whom cannot afford their own private health
insurance. The group believes that, in spite

The path to an art career requirethrifty riding an symarketmgnalonngn wit artistlicllabiiity. MCT Campus

of the j okes that surround the “starving art-
ist” trope, the challenges facing artists in the
modern era are nothing to scoff at.

“It’s a notoriously difficult life to carve
out for yourself as an independent artist,”
Sokolow said, adding that the majority of
the artists she knows “are piecing a living to-

, gether through various part-time gigs,” such

as work in the service industry, freelance
work, actual sales of their art and adjunct
teaching at colleges and universities.

Sokolow takes issue with this stereotype,
noting that creative types “have to be very
careful not to glamorize unhealthy cliches,”
because they dampen sympathy for the very
real challenges that artists face. “We work
as hard as anybody in any other profession,
if not harder,” Sokolow added.

Though Sokolow acknowledges that
most artists expect to’ make little money
and are “really well adapted to live within
their means,” frugality do‘esn’t solve all of
their problems, such as acquiring health
insurance or dealing with unexpected ex-
penses and debts.

This is nothing new to the artworld. Cyn-
thia Stanchak, a member of the Pittsburgh
Society of Artists who combines elements
of metalworking, painting and photography
into her mixed—media art, has worked as
an independent artist for the past 30 years
and faced many of the same issues early on.
According to Stanchak, for any artist who
seeks to work solely on their art, “the ﬁrst
challenge is the ﬁnancial challenge.”

Though Stanchak originally had the goal

« of pursuing her art full time, she found that

Looking for a job? Better dress the part

Matt Singer .
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

Robert Beecher is no stranger to profes-
sionalism. And as a Pitt senior who has had
internships in Senator Bob Casey’s district-
office and with 8th District City Councilman
Bill Peduto’s mayoral campaign, Beecher
knows the importance of dressing profes-
sionally in the workplace. .

“When you’re thinking about the type of
dress to wear, you have to be aware of the
impression you want to give off,” he said.

\ As college-aged young adults start to ﬁnd
themselves in professional jobs or in intern-
ships, it’s important that they’re aware of
how their choice of. clothing impacts the
impression others have of them. A well-
pressed suit and tie can go a long way, and
these ensembles tell employers that young

adults do, in fact, take their jobs seriously. J

Beecher recognizes that his professional
experiences fall into what he describes as a
more traditional work environment, so he
sticks to tasteful and professional attire.
But, he recognizes that the type of dress
appropriate for speciﬁcjobs may differ from
industry to industry.

Amy Lynes, the on—campus recruit-
ment coordinator of Pitt’s Office of Career
Development and Placement Assistance,
encourages students to be aware of the type

increasing number of non-Christians, many ‘

researchers say.

The Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious
Understanding, located in New York, reported
that more than one—third of employees say
their employers do not adequately accommo-
date religion in the workplace. An April 2013
study concluded that the most commonly
reported grievances include no time off on
religious holidays or Sabbath days, as well
as a lack of dietary options under religious
guidelines, including kosher or vegetarian.

Trinity College conducted a survey on
American religious self-identiﬁcation in 2010.
The survey found that the U.S. population of
major religions comprises about 173.4 mil-

lion Christians, 2.7 million Jews, 1.3 million '

of job to which they’re applying or for which
they’re working.

“The employers’ opinion varies by in-
dustry, company and recruiter. Always
dress for the job that you are trying to get.

' For instance, the style and.interview at a

fashion-based employer is going to be much

different than the style and interview at a-
Fortunesoo company,” Lynes said in an -

email. -“A general rule of thumb is that it is
always better to be overdressed than to be
too casual and under-dressed.” —
For students who are preparing for an
interview, it’s always better to be safe than
sorry. Jamie Moyes, a career development
specialist at the Tafel Center for Student
Success through Pitt’s College of Business

Administration, says that a student should i

aim to be more dressed up than the person
interviewing them. '

“It’s always better to wear professional
dress,” she said. “So if there’s ever a question
of ‘Should Iwear a suit?’ It’s better to be safe
and wear the suit.” 5

Some of the most common mistakes that

students make when dressing profession— S

ally are related to clothing’s ﬁt and color,
as well as the appropriate incorporation
of accessories, into an outﬁt. Men should
always have a navy, black or charcoal-gray’
suit and should avoid pinstripes. Standard
recommended dress shirts are light blue

Muslims and 1.2 million Buddhists.

“There are so many people from differ-
ent religions, so how can you accommodate
them all?” asked Mohammad Mozumder, a
Bangladesh native and graduate student who
teaches sociology of religion. “I don’t really
know the ideal solution, but I know there is a
lack of concern for people who cannot enjoy
their religions ﬁilly.”

The Legal Protections

Religion is a protected identity according
to federal law. Employers are required to ac-

commodate the religion of an employee or _

prospective employee under Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 unless the accom-
modation inflicts an “undue hardship” upon
the employer. J

Undue hardship is considered to be ex-
traordinary costs, diminished efﬁciency, im-
pediment inother employees’ job rights and
beneﬁts or the impairment of work safety,

or white, and ties with polka dots, paisley
or repetitive patterns are always a safe bet.
Men’s shoes should match their belts, and
dress socks should reach their calves.

For women, a suit or tailored dress is a S

solid professional look, with pant or skirt
suits serving as versatile staples. Closed-
toe pumps are best, and heels should be no
more than two inches. The shoes a woman

James Craft, a professor of business ad-
ministration at Pitt, said that a company is
obligated to respect and accommodate al-

ternative religions, especially if employees ,

express interest in such policies: _

Craft said that possible workplace accom-
modations may include a day or speciﬁc hours
off, a substitute to ﬁll in for the day or a loca-
tion where an employee can say prayers in
quiet. I if P

But Mozumder said that some accommo-
dations, such as an afternoon off, can weaken
the religious observance.

“Those who are Muslims, they don’t have
official holidays or days off,” he said. “[Mus—
lims] cannot celebrate their holidays fully
because [they] are concerned that [they] have
to come back to work. You have to leave your
friends who are celebrating.”

While some of these rules might seem

negligible, students should always be aware

of what the speciﬁcs of their outﬁts say about

them. In Beecher’s opinion, paying attention .

Danielle.Kranjec, a seniorjewish educa— J

Pittsburgh, said workers should be proactive
in seeking religious adjustments from the
moment they interview for a position and
negotiate a contract. She added that certain

1 instances might present an additional chal-
lenge, especially for professionals who work A

on call in a hospital or lawyers who work in a

Hyatt noted, however, “Your degree does
not always dictate what career track you take
— your experience does. Student’s majors
in college become less relevant as they gain
experience in different ﬁelds.  One does
not have to be in the same industry to learn
professional development skills. People who
make career changes can certainly take many
transferable skills into their new roles.”

Morehouse’s thirstfor adventure was
not quenched by the ﬁsheryjob, and he left
the job at the end of the summer to travel to
Vancouver Island, British Columbia, to work
on an organic vegetable farm.

After working at the farm, Morehouse
returned to'the United_States and began
busing tables in a French restaurant in New
York City. While the job was conventional
compared to his previous work experience,
it was something he had always been curi-
ous about.

Three weeks into his busboy job, More-
house scored the highest out of the entire
restaurant wait staff on a quiz meant to mea-
sure knowledge of wine pairings and various

other aspects of the restaurant. Morehouse.
A was promoted to general manager and wine

steward of the restaurant. A

An advocate for constant self— education,
Morehouse said that even though he was not
conventionally studying biology during these

jobs, he still saw biology and applied it to
everything he did. It is all about the student’s
perspective.

“The restaurant was about what happens
to living things.  That whole situation is very
much about the biology of the vines and the
vineyards, how you time things based on the
time of the year and the climate conditions
and soils,” he said. “Alaska and the seas are
teeming with amazing creatures. I was in-
teracting with living things all the time. On
the vegetable farm, I was interacting with
vegetables and animals and ﬁingi and all sorts
of things.” ,

Although Morehouse found his j ob at the
organic farm through friends, World Wide
Opportunities on Organic Farms arranges
for volunteers to work on organic farms for
four to six hours a day in exchange for room
and board.

Volunteers can choose from 70 different
countries to visit, but are responsible for

paying their own travel costs. Volunteers also _

have the opportunity to choose the length
of their stay on the farm, from two days to
six months. -

In addition to connecting graduates to
far—off adventures, WWOOF administrator
Amanda Pearson said the program “provides
practical skills and encourages independence
in terms of food production and consump-
tion.  These are skills for life.”

She added that WWOOF programs help
to inspire conﬁdence and self—esteem and
that a potential employer would welcome
these attributes.

The ﬁshing, farming or restaurant indus-
tries might not interest everyone, but there
are other ways to land an unorthodox job
after graduation;

Odd Job Nation is an unconventional
job—listing site founded by Jeremy Redleaf,
an actor, writer, director and producer for
TV and ﬁlm.

On his website, Redleaf described Odd
Jobs Nation as the ultimate resource for part-
time opportunists. Redleaf said in an email
that odd jobs can be ﬁnancial life rafts‘ for
recent college graduates.

“[Odd jobs] can also provide experience
dealing with untraditional bosses and even
serve as fodder for job interviews. What
employer wouldn’t want to hear about the
summer you spent assisting a magician?”
said Redleaf.

‘ According to Redleaf, ‘the site receives
over 100,000 visitors a month. The job
listings are grouped together ﬁrstby state,
then by city or area. Seventeen Pemisylvania
regions are listed on Odd Jobs Nation, and
about 125 job listings are currently posted
in the Pittsburgh section.’

Odd]ob’s Pittsburgh listings have offered
a multitude of curious work positions, such
as pet product demonstrator, professional
handyman, magician’s assistant and female
ﬁre eater. ‘

Jobs of this nature are not typically
thought of as part of a young professional’s
climb to success, yet Redleaf maintained that
now is the perfect time to pursue an odd job
that is emotionally fulﬁlling, if not conven-
tionally resumé—building.

“If that means eating ﬁre, eat ﬁre!” he
said. “It’s the people who lack the courage
to pursue their odd happiness that end up
getting burnt.” .

Tanenbaum Study

In the Tanenbaum Center’s What American

Workers Really Think About Religion study; '

the center concluded that 36 percent of work-
ers either personally experienced or witnessed
religious “non-accommodation” — a term
coined by the center —‘ in the workplace.

According to the survey, 24 percent of
employees reported non—accommodations
that included being required to work on Sab-
bath observances or a religious holiday, and
13 percent of employees reported attending
work events that did not offer kosher, halal
or vegetarian options. A

Almost halfofnon-Christian workers re— '

ported experiencing or witnessing religious
non-accommodation at their jobs. About 22
percent of workers reported that they discuss
religious beliefs inthe workplace occasionally.

According to the study, Catholics feel the
most comfortable when the topic of religion
arises in the workplace.

In terms of workplace diversity, about 13
percent of workers reported that their com-
panies are highly diverse, while 35 percent re-

ported moderate diversity, leaving 52 percent A
' of workers reporting low to minimal diversity.

The survey measured nine possible forms
of religious non-accommodation, including
discouragement of facial hair or dress styles
inherent to the religion, refusal to give time
off to pray or meditate during the workday
or attendance of company—sponsored event
that served no halal, kosher or vegetarian

options. The study also addressed workplace‘

issues such as discouragement from display-
ing religious beliefs, requirement to work on
Sabbath Observances or a religious holiday,
discouragement from creating a religious net-
work or criticismfor not attending company
social events. I

Making Do

Despite legal ‘protections, both students

and professionals said they compromised
their faith to get along in the workplace.
Michael Fingerman, president of the Hil-
lel Center on campus, said that the dearth of
kosher options on University meal plans might
deter ﬁiture Jewish students from attending
the school. Currently, kosher options are not
available at Market Central or The Perch.
“It’s a deterrent for a lot of prospective
Jewish students to come here,” he said. “They
come here, realize there’s not much they can
eat and cross Pitt off their list.,It’s diﬂicult to
explore the different ways of connectingwith
their faith because a huge part ofjudaism is
keeping kosher.”
According to both Fingerman and Haque,

a group of Muslim students accompanied by '

Vice Provost and Dean of Students Kathy
Humphrey took a trip to Carnegie Mellon
University last spring. While there, Humphrey
and the students explored the options for both
kosher and halal foods in addition to viewing
“the university’s prayer room.
“We are not creatinga prayer room, but

' we are working to create a student reﬂection

space, where students can pray if they choose
‘ or engage in other reﬂective activities,” Hum-
phrey said in a statement emailed to The Pitt

News. Haque said that the Muslim students —

had some success with menu changes after
the visit. Halal options were added to the
Market Central lunch menu during the 2011-
2012 academic year. But during his freshman
and sophomore years, Haque said that he was
essentially a “forced vegetarian.” .

Additionally, Muslims typically reserve a
room in the William Pitt Union to pray daily.
Haque said that as more Muslims began to
attend, the space became too small to ﬁt ev-
eryone comfortably.

“Many students wouldn’tfeel comfortable
just praying on the William Pitt Union lawn.
It’s nerve-racking,” he said. “Some students
will even pray between bookshelves at the
Hillman Library.” '

While companies and universities typically
grant employees off for Christian holidays,
including Christmas and Easter, Vince Burens,
vice president of the Coalition for Christian
Outreach, noted the declining regard for clos-
ing on Sundays.

“It’s ironic, actually. I’m a Christian, it’s
a Sunday, and I’m driving to a work event,”

he said. “The trend is that more and more 4

ment and Placement Assistance recommends
students research whatever makes the most
sense for their career path and passion.

“One does not have to be in the same in-
dustry to learn professional development
skills,” said Hyatt. “People who make career
change can certainly take many_ transferable
skills into their new roles.”

In regard to resumes and job interviews,

Morehouse thinks unorthodox jobs will not
be a setback to applicants. '

“I don’t think it has hurt me to have had
these experiences because I think that it
makes me a more grounded person,” said
Morehouse. “When I was interviewing for
a job or applying, I could draw on those ex-
periences.”

“People that are constantly worried about
having all of their ducks in a row might just
ﬁnd themselves losing something to some-

» one who has done something unusual or

outstanding or noteworthy.”

If a student does not have a professional
job waiting for them after graduation, it is
not uncommon for them to retum to their
parent’s homes. Morehouse recommended
that students stay hungry for adventure and
not let life slip by in such a way.“Go out. Ex-
plore. See what’s fascinating to you, because
there is ‘nothing that replaces passion for
something. If you already found your passion
in something before you begin exploring, you
will see it in everything you do.”
“If you are still seeking your passion, the
best place to ﬁnd it is on a new trail,” he said.

DRESS .

shows employers that students are detail-
orientated. Making sure that everything -
shoes, belt, tie, accessories — work well
together is an essential step in getting ready
for work each day.

Lynes says that the misconception among
young professionals that they can’t afford
professional attire is unsubstantiated, stat-
ing that many retailers offer student dis-
counts. These student discounts come in
addition to retailers’ normal sales, promo-
tions and coupons. She also says that going
out and buying a whole new wardrobe may
not always be necessary, although invest-
ing in a few professional staples is.always a
great choice. ’

“You can always mix and match existing
articles in your closet to create a professional
look,” said Lynes. “However, investing in
one good‘ suit now will go a longway toward
a career no matter the stage of the process
you are in.” . V

But although students can use some of
their preexisting clothes in their professional
outﬁts, they need to be careful not to become
too informal in how they dress, even if their
great ﬁrst impression in an interview landed
them the job. ' ’ . V. A’

Students would do well to remember
their major, their industry and the culture
of their place of employment, Moyes says.
Some employers may want to see their em-

ployees demonstrate a bit of individual style, '

but others may prefer a uniform dress code.

In her opinion, students need to remember A

that they should keep in mind the old say-
ing, “dress for thejob you want, not the job
‘you have,” before dressing too informally.

Beecher agrees,.saying that thetype of
dress a student wears should be conditional
on the type of work environment. He says
that as a student becomes more comfort-
able at the workplace, they’ll be better able
to adapt their dress to the speciﬁcs of what
their employer wants and know whether
or not certain styles will ﬂy. But, he says,
though a young professional’s effort is rec-
ognized and appreciated by employers, it’s
important for the attire to complement the
student’s demeanor.

“The dress is important and it’s very
critical, but it has to be coupled with a pro-
fessional impression and a professional at-
titude,” he said. I

Machinetranslation: a useful, but imperfect:,,,%,tQ9|

Gideon Bradshaw
News Editor

When Carol Bove ran a passage she uses in
her class through an online translator, the
software lost some things in translation.

“I spent four months in America is low,
and in addition I traveled for pleasure and
random occasions, there are huge areas of the
new world, whichl did not have any escape,”
begins thelGoogle Translate edition of Simone
de Beauvoir’s “America Day by Day.”

Bove, a seniorlecturer in Pitt’s Department
of English who teaches a translation studies
course, said that “is low” should have read
“it’s a little bit,” and “escape” should have
been translated as “glimpses.”

While software developers and profes-
sional translators agree that the ﬂowery lan-
guage of poetry and literature would be better
left to human translators, they have more
trouble agreeing on the best use of machine
translation programs. Professionals are de-
bating the accuracy of translation software,
its effect on jobs and what texts it can and

carmot translate.

In 2010, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
estimated that the number of positions for
foreign-language translators in the U. S. would
increase by 42 percent over the next decade
— three times the average for all industries
in the U.S. job market. While exact numbers
are unknown, there are probably hundreds
of thousands of translators, interpreters and
people who use language in theirjobs.

While these professionals would prob-
ably all be able to tell the diiference between
“escape” and “glimpses” in their respective
languages, they are needed less and less for
jobs that involve translating chunks of text.
Instead, machine translation, completed on
computers, iPads and smartphones, is taking
over those jobs.

Jaime Carbonell, the director of Carnegie

Mellon University’s Language Technologies A

Institute, said translation software relies
on having enough digitized text in both the
original and the target language in order to
generate the meaning that is most likely to

be correct. .

This means that for commonly written
languages such as English, Chinese and Hindi,
there is a lot of text for machine translators to
use. But for less commonly used languages,
there is subsequently less text to guide ma-
chine translation programs toward correct

‘ translation.

Using humans and using computers each
has its own advantages.

“Machines tend to interpret technical
words right, and humans tend to be the other
way around,” Carbonell said.

- While humans are unlikely to remember
speciﬁc, technical vocabulary offhand unless
they use it frequently, computers can store
almost endless dictionary ﬁles.

But machine translation programs strug-
gle with sentence structure, especially when

- two languages differ. For example, designing
alprogram thatcan rewrite EnglishinGerman
or Spanish is easierthan doing so inChinese.

Carbonell said that, in some cases, it is
relatively easy for machine translation pro-

ing,” he said.

grams to deﬁne a word based on context.

For instance, when the word “bank” appears
next to “account,” it is likely that a translation
program would know it refers to a ﬁnancial

institution rather than to a riverbank. But if
such contextual clues are farther apart, com-

puters have considerably more trouble.

But translating poems isn’t on the top of
companies’ to-do lists. Computers can get a
general idea oflong passages almost instantly,
while humans have to labor through them.

, Carbonell said that while machine transla-
tion can’t replace human knowledge, the logi-
cal next step for companies is to use comput-
ers to do the grunt work while humans look
over their shoulders and check the ﬁnished
product. ' .

RELIGION

Valerie Hart, a junior leader at the New-

man Center, said that not all professors have i

recognized Catholic Holy Days when she
raised the issue to them. During the spring
of her freshman year, one of Hart’s professor
threatened Hart with failure if she missed
class on Good Friday, which Hart calls “one
of the biggest days outside of Christmas and
Easter.” In the interest of getting along, Hart
went to class anyway.

For students whose holidays are not rec-
ognized on the calendar, they sometimes
choose to make compromises in order not to
fall behind. Duringhis freshman year, Haque
went to class during the end of the Ramadan
because he “didn’t want to fall behind as ev-

eryone was moving forward.”

Mozumder said that conservative Mus-
lims,who do notdrinkor eat pork, sometimes
avoid company events out of embarrassment.

“When [practicing Muslims] celebrate,
there is no alcohol. For many people, this feels
like something is missing,” he said. “It gives
the sense that [we’re] ‘not coo .”’

A Sweep Away From Faithfulness Toward
Acceptance '

In an environment that fosters knowledge
and diversity, students might ﬁnd themselves
lulled into a sense of security, allowing them
to believe that discrimination does not exist.
Once they enter the workforce, what they ﬁnd
could surprise them.

“As these minority groups grow and be-

It’s going to put pressure on the company to
be accepting because they’ll need to be to get

, more talent.”

’ Members of all faiths noticed a trend to-
ward avoiding religious conversation or faith
at all, especially as technology progresses.
Mozumder, who studies secularism, said that
aspects of modernization, including techno-
logical advancements, urbanization, indus-
trialization and science, have made religion

“The younger generation tends to be more
open to diversity than perhaps some of the
older, more senior people may be,” he said.
“The_re’s a changing emphasis that the older
generation has on higher qualiﬁed people.

“uncool” in the face of progress.

“You can talk about music, science, lit-
erature, culture  But religion see_ms to be
something that you stray away from or are
suspicious of as science progresses,” he said.

Burens noted that the ability to click away
on an iPhone at any hour of the day, including
weekends, created a barrier to Sunday rest.

' Now, he noted that Sunday looks like atypical

business day in most situations.

Forjews, the Shabbat, or Sabbath, takes
place between sundown Friday and Saturday.
Depending on the degree of observance, some

Jews do not use electricity or carry heavy items
on those days. '

Fingerman said that he would prefer to
ﬁnd a job that did not require hours within
his Shabbat. p .

Kranjec said that technology has created

more opportunities for religious accom-
modation, because work hours are no longer
conﬁned from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

“With technology, more and more, we’re
able to change the work week and hours so
that as long as the work gets done, it doesn’t
necessarily matter when it’s being done.”

Mozumderreﬂected Craft’s point, add-
ing that the millennial generation may in

fact change the face of workplace diversity.

“We want it to happen. We want people
of different religions to come together and

work side by side and live side by side,” he
said. “Since 9/11, there has been tension of
course, but there has also been a lot of grow-
ing curiosity about each other [Muslims and
Christians] and to understand each other.’I

COLUMN

o

lnternshipsshould widen, not narrow, student interests, .

Simon Brown
Columnist
1 _

Some ships are made of wood. Some

ships‘ are made of steel. But the most

legally ‘ambiguous and educationally
dubious ships‘ are internships.
Granted, I might have taken some
liberties with that quote, but it sums
up the currentvstatus of unpaid intern-

T ships quite well.

But after long-overdue publicity sur-

rounding the unfair conditions in which

many student interns work, educators,
employers and students are beginning
to rethink the best way to introduce stu-
dents into the working world. Though
the responsibility rests on many dif-
ferent shoulders, students can begin to
improve the ‘situation by reconsidering

the most common attitude toward in-

ternships — that they are simply step.-
ping stones to one particular ﬁeld of

V employment.

Rather, if students approached in-

ternships as opportunities to expe-
rience work environments and skill
sets they’ve rarely encountered, the

institution can regain its educational 7

legitimacy. , q . .
As several high-proﬁle cases have
recently been brought-itto light, the un-
paid internship exists now largelylto
exploit the unskilled labor of college
students eager to enter the job market,
regardless of the entrance. Defenders

‘maintain that direct workplace experi-
ence is the best introduction to gainful ‘

employment, even if there is no mon-
etarygain to be had on the part of the
student.

Despite these claims, the now trite
image of the coffee-fetching college
junior happily interning at a major com-
pany is no myth. D‘

Though it’s easy to depict employers
in these cases as the greedy robber bar-

” ons preying on naive college students,
it’s the students themselves who happily .

V play into the system.

Though it might seem counterintui-
tive to some, the willingness of college
students to accept no. pay for what too
often has no educational beneﬁt makes
sense in light of current expectations.

Since providing unpaid internships
often comes at little cost to compa-
nies, their prevalence in an otherwise
contracted job market has maintained
strength. This means that more and
more students and graduates unable
to ﬁnd paid employment resort to the

next best thing: an internship.

It has now become less of a unique
educational opportunity and more of
a ritual supposedly required to attract
any attention from a potential employ-
er. And regarding those students who
can claim that an impressed employer
hired them after their internship, such a
benefit is strictly personal. That is, the
personal connections and diligent work
that oftenlands someone a job follow-

ing an internship might be helpful for .

the person lucky enough to ﬁnd that

opportunity, but that doesn’t mean they _

provide the valuable vocational training
that beneﬁts society as a whole.
The real problem, however, is that

V this ritual —— like most — produces

almost no tangible results. Despite
the mantra, unpaid internships do not
measurably lead to paid employment.
Students with experience as unpaid in-
terns have only a negligible advantage
over their inexperienced peers when it
comes to ﬁnding jobs of anykind.
So should the entire house of cards
collapse now that the illusion has been
;revealed? No: But it will have to be
_ grounded on a ﬁrmer foundation of
students’ expectations. '
'If students and universities consid-
ered internships more as opportunities

late that, although the program did get a
great ‘deal right, “a person with foreign

_ language skills is needed in order to make

the best use of machine translation for a

documents through a machine translation ’
program to ﬁnd the relevant ones could save
a human a great deal of trouble.

But for some things, computers have
more trouble. For instance, even the best
translation software can’t convey nuance.
This means that machine translation would
be almost useless in literature or poetry.

This also limits what it can do in adver-
tising, where persuading the audience re-

for meaning.

“If your sentence has simile or sarcasm,
it’s important to reﬂect that in the transla-
tion.” t

M Cavanagh said that Translate Media,
which has a total of about 6,500 linguists
worldwide, employs about 2,000 translators
who have proved themselves reliable to check

. and edit others’ work. These editors also

check translations produced by software.
Translate Media uses machine translation to
complete work for some of its projects, but
only with the permission of clients. It also

 
      

uses translation memory, which differs from
machine translation in an important way.
When a word, phrase or sentence in the
new text matches a segment of text that
has already been translated and stored, the
- memory translation program replaces the
segment of text in the old language with the
corresponding text in the new language.
In translation memory, a computer looks
in the document for segments of text that
have already been translated.

In machine translation, a computer cre-

ates its own translation based on rules, a sta-
tistical algorithm or a combination of both.

Digital Rosetta Stones

Some machine translation developers
say that their programs are becoming good
enough to translate a company’s image from
one language to another. — V

Udi Hershkovich is thelvice president of
business development at Safaba Translation
Solutions, which is based in Squirrel Hill.

Safaba, whose’ name combines the He-

brew words for “language” and “within”.

to communicate the idea that “language is
within the machine,” develops programs for
companies that translate their e—commerce

sites, marketing literature, tech support and .

even internal emails into multiple languages.
_The company, which was founded in
' 2009, is considered a spinoff of CMU’s
Language Technologies Institute. Although
Safaba is institutionally separate from the
university, Hershkovich saidthat CMU owns
a minority share of the company. Dell and
' Paypal are the only two Safaba- clients that
' have been made public.
Safaba’s programs don’t just communi-
T cate meaning from one language to another,
according to Hershkovich. Each program
is designed speciﬁcally for a client to com-
municate the client’s brand, which relies
heavily on word choice. Hershkovich used
the corporate language that Apple employs
on its website as an example of a very artistic
image. ’

He pointed to a web pagefor one of Ap-
ple’s products as an example. On the page,
Apple writes that the device includes “sen-
sors to dim the screen in low-light condi-
tions.” -

“If I translate that into Russian, I could
say, ‘dim the screen in_ low-light conditions’
in so many different ways,” Hershkovich
said. “But they chose that way.”

This summer I_ had an I'I‘ internship with a

_Fortune 500 company. At the conclusion of

the internship, I had to give a presentation
to an entire room of analysts, engineers and
executives, including the CIO. I had to explain

my contributions, effectively justifying my-

salary for the past three months, and make
a convincing case for why they should hire
me full-time. Does that sound like a situation

. for which your coursework has adequately

prepared you?

If you’re a student in a STEM discipline
—- science, technology, engineering or
mathematics —— your program is probably
designed to develop your “hard” skills. You’ve
gained some concrete technical abili , the
kind of expertise that might appear on your
resume: knowledge of a process, a software
or a methodology. Maybe you’ve even earned
a professional certiﬁcation. But what your
program doesn’t teach you is the “soft” skills:

  STEM majors need soft skills

those intangible, personality—speciﬁc skills
that leaders, team players, negotiators and
mediators possess. Soft skills include positive
attitude, good organization,‘ effective com-
munication and general agreeability. Skills
such as these are difficult to. quantify on a
resume but are weighed heavily during the
interview process.

It’s no secret that employers greatly value
soft skills. Survey data has supported this for
decades. A recent study by the Seattle Jobs
Initiative found that 75 percent of employers
considersoltskills to beas importantas— or

more important than — technical sl<ills..A S

lack of soft skills is also cited as the primary
reason technical projects fail. -

The economy is tough on everyone, but
tougher on those who don’t get a college
degree or waste their time on non-quan-
titative disciplines. Those that keep their
cool and pile prestige onto their practical

’ plate will be the ones who get paid and live

happy lives — the key to which is cash.
Two’University of Michigan professors
have demonstrated that richer countries
are happier countries and that there are
no diminishing returns on that ‘happiness.
That is: “Moremoney will make you hap-
pier.” Hence, imperative to all of our happi-
ness and well-being is the quintessentially
American pursuit of capital.
Unfortunately, with unemployment at
7.4 percent as ofjuly 2013, many are being
shut out of the pursuit of happiness. This
is particularly true of recent entrants into

the workforce without a college degree:

They face a staggering unemployment rate
of 16.2 percent, according to The New
York Times.

This fact underscores the reason for
students’ presence on Pitt’s campus: to
gain a credential that will bolster their sal-
aries for a lifetime. According to Business
Insider, after 20 years, a college diploma
leads to almost $25,000 in extra income.
That’s $25,000 in extra happiness.

But even a college degree is not enough
to guarantee fully gainful employment.
Underemployment among recent college
graduates —' a demographic many of us are
poised to join in the next few years —— was
44 percent in 2012, according to the Wall

NGO Work: a viable option for political science majors  

Nick Voustinos
Columnist

Whenever you tell someone that you’re a po-
litical science major, it is usually followed by
the question, “Well, what do you want to do
with that?” _

This usually begs a rather vague and diffi-
cult answer. Perhaps one of the most common
answers is, of course, law school, at least if
you want to follow the money. And don’t get
me wrong, for some people law school is the
perfect ﬁt.

But if you’re like me and you would rather
not spend the money on another couple of
years of school, and, I’ll admit it, you’d also
rather not complete all the tedious desk work
that comes with it, perhaps you would be bet-
ter of pursuing a more hands-on path.

That being said, the growing alternative to
law school for many political science students
is the nongovernmental organizations, or
NGO, track. Any introductory politics course
will most likely inform you of the expansive

inﬂuence NGOs have on international affairs.

Their sheer number alone of can provide you
with a hint of their capable political clout, as
there are an estimated 1.5 million located just
in the United States.

Yet, the importance of NGOs lies in the
work they do, not necessarily in their num-
bers. They can be involve themselves in a
diverse number of areas: Third World devel-
opment, environmental protection, human
rights work — the list goes on. And since
they are indeed nongovernmental, their goals
purely reﬂect their causes and no national
interests of any sort. This objectivity makes
them reliable sources forintemational insti-
tutions, such as the U.N., as they can provide
unbiased information and statistics on certain
global issues. _

Perhaps the most recognizable example
would be Amnesty International. Amnesty
is an NGO that speciﬁcally deals with human
rights issues by campaigning against viola-
tions of civil liberties around the globe. The
company specializes in researching and ex-

posing injustices, making it extremely difﬁcult

, --Inn-v

AHOTSRGH

for states to get away with crimes against their
people without it being known to the world.
Therefore, Amnesty Intemational’s tireless
activism helps the voices of those living in
less transparent countries be heard.

Thus, working for an NGO such as Am-
nesty International tends beneﬁt your soul.
However, there’s more to gain in working for
an NGO than just points on your ethical score-
card. Arguably, one of the most important
commodities one can attain through working
with an NGO is the experience, and _I mean

L this both in the sense of career—oriented and

actual, real-world experience.

When it comes to experiencing the world
and the people in it, NGO work offers a seri-
ous opportunity to travel and interact with
other cultures. Organizations are constantly
looking for motivated college grads to send
abroad to take part in ﬁeldwork, which can
involve anything from handing out food or
medical supplies and planning development
projects to aiding in disaster relief. Again, not
only is this satisfying on an ethical level, but

the chance to fully immerse oneself in another
culture really panders to travel junkies with a
passion for international affairs.

One can easily take a look at one of the
world’s most successful Third World devel-
opment organizations, BRAC — formerly
known as the Bangladesh Rural Advancement
Committee —— to gain an idea of the altruistic
work one can participate in through working
with an NGO. BRAC works in Third World
countries across Africa and Asia, involving
every facet of sustainable development: edu-
cation, sanitation, health care, community
empowerment, etc. .

So, when working for an NGO such as
‘ BRAC, you can expect to learn skills in a va-

riety of developmental areas. Meaning that
your experiences could involve anythingfrom
teaching local children basic math at one of
BRAC’s many school programs to operating at
a local BRAC-rtm1egal—aid clinic empowering
and giving a voice to those who are usually

If Safaba designed a program for Apple,
Hershkovich said, it would favor such artistic
phrases.

Safaba’s programs rely on statistical
translation, in which the program uses pre-
viously translated text in the same languages
as a kind of Rosetta Stone—eque method to
choose the translation that is the most likely
correct. -

Hershkovich said that each client of Sa-
faba employs translators who edit and cor-
rect the machine translator’s work. As they
tweak the program, it learns how to produce
translations tailored to the company’s image.

Hershkovich also predicted that advances
in machine translation would drastically
change the market and job description for
translators. While many translators now
start from scratch, they could instead take
a shortcut by using a machine translation
program to do most of the work for them. _

Because even the best machine transla-
tion programs still need a human with skills
in both languages to check the translation
and make sure it’s worded correctly, human

translators are not indanger of losing their

jobs, Hershkovich said.’

Instead, by letting machinetranslation
programs translate text ﬁrst and then edit-
ing it for mistakes, a  translator can

produce between two and four times as much‘

work.

But not all translation professionals
agree. A ,

a chainsaw to clear a large area.

“It’s very fast for cutting down a lot of
trees, but you’re not going to use it for brain
surgery,” he said. “You can talk about building
a faster chainsaw. You can talk about building
a cleaner chainsaw. But it’s still a chainsaw.”

Hendzel insisted that it could be danger-
ous for a company to use machine translation
for any of its own legal texts or any other
sensitive material. V

“Machine translation is not designed to
be perfect,” Hendzel said. “It’s designed to
be imperfect and fast.”

He added that translation software, even
with human translators correcting it, would
create a tremendous risk. This is especially
true in scientiﬁc, ﬁnancial or legal transla-
tions, where mistranslation creates severe
liabilities. “

To do so, Hendzel said, would be like.
having a room full of eighth-graders each A
write a paragraph and then trying to edit the -

paragraphs into a complete article for pub’-
lication. It would be easier to write a whole
article from scratch. l 4

“Don’t get me wrong, they’re really enthu-
siastic eighth-graders,” he said. “But they’re
still eighth-graders.”

Hendzelsaid companieswouldbeunwise r  ..

to use machine translation for anything that
could “endanger their brand,” such as legal,

L ﬁnancial and marketing information.

Cavanagh agreed and said that Translate
Media would “absolutely not” use software
to translate any of its own legal documents.

' Cavanagh also said that humans can produce
g higher-quality translations without machine

translation than by rewriting a computer’s
awkward sentence structure. i

complex topic. One individual can’t effectively
explain the topic in terms the audience can
comprehend, though the other is eloquent,
captivating and clear. We automatically as-
sume the latter individual is more competent
or has more expertise, although he mightjust
be better at pitchingthe same idea. Presenta-
tions and interviews are no different.

For STEM students, soft skills are often as
elusive as they are intangible. One problem
is that they aren’t taken seriously when they
do appear in the curriculum. '

Yes, we’re forced to take liberal arts
classes. But writing a few essays for a gen-

eral education requirement class does not’

make you Shakespeare, and not many of us
really apply ourselves to humanities classes
in the ﬁrst place.

Yes, we’re forced to do group projects.
Ideally, a group effort would teach us about
leadership and collaboration, simulating
teamwork in the professional world. But in
reality, the workload isn’t distributed fairly,
it’s-nearly impossible to set meeting times

that workfor everyone’s schedules, and the
whole ordeal is often more frustrating than
rewarding.

Yes, we’re forced to give presentations.
But when is the last time you watched a peer
give a captivating presentation for a class
assignment? How about the last time you
gave a passionate speech from the podium
of a classroom? Most of the time we’re either
slumpedinboredom and counting downthe
minutes or sitting nervously and dreading
having to go next.

The problem isn’t that we don’t have
enough opportunities to develop soft skills.
Humanities classes, group projects and pre-
sentations are all legitimate means to build
these skills. The problem is that we STEM
students often treat soft skills as superﬂuous
or just assume thatwe’re already good enough
in this area. The former mindset is deluded,
the latter is ignorant. We need to develop
soft skills with the same rigorous approach
and attention to detail that we apply to hard
skills, and there is always room to improve.

How do we deﬁne rigorous improve-
ment? One approach is formal training. The
communication department at Pitt offers

7 introductory and advanced courses in pub-

lic speaking. Having taken one, I can assure

you that studying the theory behind effective

communication and then applying it to sev-
'eral speeches is’ much different than doing a
ﬁnal presentation in a technical class.

If you don’t have room in your schedule
for another course, practical experience is a
great altemaltive. Toastmasters International
is well-known group dedicated to develop—
ing skilled speakers and leaders. There are
several local Toastmasters chapters, with
ones at Pitt and CMU both meeting regu-
larly. Members can give speeches on topics of
choice, receive feedback and progress along
a certiﬁcation track.

If neither of those are feasible for you, Pitt
now offers a student subscription to Lynda.
com, a site containing quality video instruc-
ﬁon on several topics, including soft skills for
business. Whatever your method, you need

V to have a conscious and structured approach

to developing your soft skills. Science and

technology advance rapidly, and many of

today’s coveted hard skills might be obsolete
tomorrow. But soﬁ: skills will remain transfer-
able from job to job and essential throughout
your entire career. Q

to get acquainted with a work environ-
ment and experiences with clear edu-
cational goals, then all parties would
stand to benefit. Most importantly, ‘it
would relieve the pressure that students
feel to rush into the ﬁrst internship they

deem necessary to enter their career. V

The language of a competitive edge sim-
ply perpetuates this stress, and colleges
like Pitt ought to reconsider its use.
Most importantly, thischange in the
culture surrounding the internship will
require that students appreciate these
opportunities as glimpses into career
paths that go undiscovered in the cur-
riculum. Especially in an economy that
rapidly antiquates skill sets and values
adaptability, pursuing internships that
pique curiosity and expand horizons
prove far more meaningful than many
internships as they currently exist.

liant portfolio isn’t going to do an artist
much good unless they’ve learned how to
market their work. The truth is, without ef-
fective marketing, most artists will struggle
to develop a following for themselves.

As Stanchak puts it, “When you’re an
early career artist and an emerging artist,
you have to build your reputation.”

Sokolow recommends that artists pre-
pare for life outside of college by familiar-
izing themselves with the business side of
art while they’re still enrolled. By interning
at nonproﬁts within the art industry, for
example, she says students can observe the
intersections of art and commerce ﬁrsthand,
giving them an idea of the negotiations be-
tween art and business they will face later.

Another aspect of a career in art that
Sokolow recommends preparingfor is grant

writing. There are a variety of different art '

grants available to students, and most of
them require that artists justify the value
of their art to the organization adminis-
tering the grant. Local organizations that
administer such grants include the Heinz En-
dowments and‘The Pittsburgh Foundation,
and large national organizations such as the

National Endowment for the Arts adminis- ‘

ter thousands of grants each year. Though
Sokolow notes that there are few art grants
that pertain strictly to individual artists, she
pointed out that The Pittsburgh Foundation
haslaunched creative development grants
f of which she was a 2012 recipient — that
offer $10,000 to a set number of individual
artists in Pittsburgh.

However, in the modern economic cli-
mate, the availability of grants is diminish-
ing. In July, the U.S. House of Representa-

tives’ Appropriations Committee approved
a bill intended to slash the budget of the
National Endowment for the Arts by 49
percent. Such a cut would reduce the pro-
grams’ funding to levels not seen since the
1970s and make the opportunities to receive
grant funding even more scarce than they
already are. ,

It’s not all bad for the modern artist,
however. New technologies, such as digital
ﬁlm and photography, have made certain
mediums far less labor intensive. Stanchak
described spending hours in contact with
toxic chemicals in a dark room early on in
her career and says that the advent of digital
photography has improved her productivity
and saved her effort. Without the relatively ’
low start—up costs of digital ﬁlmmaking, So-
kolow claims that she might have never been
able to produce the ﬁlms that have become
the basis for her Healthy Artists campaign.

Furthermore, most students who are

‘looking to go into the profession are well

aware of the marketing challenges that ac-
company the job. Pitt junior Rachel Lehm-
an—Merrick, a double major in studio arts
and physics, acknowledges that the need
for marketing is key. “You can be the most
talented person ever, but if you don’t know

_ how to get yourself out there and sell your

product, it won’t work.” Though Lehman-
Merrick enjoys her work in studio arts, she
can’t see herself as a full-time artist and
hopes to pursue a career in teaching art as
away to ensure stability while she continues
to develop her portfolio.

Still, both Stanchak and Sokolow agree
that such adversity will do little to slow down
those who are dead set on pursuing a future
in art.

“If you’re committed to your art, you’re
willing to make sacriﬁces,” Sokolow said. j

or unemployed,” which ran in April 2012.

In order to avoid this pit of unhappi-
ness and discontent that has led so many
to the Occupy Wall Street movement and
other protests, we must prepare ourselves
properly for the harsh realities of today’s
labor market. In this jungle, there are
many graduates and very few jobs: Every
job search and interview is a primal hunt
and, competitors must be defeated to se-
cure one’s meals and Netﬂix subscription.

So every little edge must be worthwhile
— otherwise, Pitt wouldn’t work so hard
to provide us with them via the Summer
Edge programs, Competitive Edge Com-
munities and the resumé-padding Outside
the Classroom Curriculum. These advan-
tages, however, will do a student no good
if one’s primary goal isn’t working toward
employability.

Since wespend a great deal of our time
in class and a great deal of our class hours

in our majors, an essential component of

a job application is the right major. With

\s‘cL*l\‘c.'ml out in l)lll‘~llL3§‘§,ll but

-today’s information—based economy, the

only right major is a quantitative major.
This is backed by hard evidence. Payscale.
com reports that the highest—earning ma-
jors are economics, computer science and
statistics, in addition to various types of
mathematics and engineering. Notice that
this list does not include any of the natu-
ral sciences:.The scientiﬁc method is for
professors and the unemployed. To make
the cut, you must major in one of the high-
earning MECSES ﬁeld.

Here, I should take a moment to discuss

majors in the non-technical disciplines:

those ﬁelds ranging in their pedantic
pointless pedagogy from philosophy to
philology. Daring to major in such a ﬁeld is
banishing oneself to eternal underemploy-

— ment and, thereby, unhappiness. Doing

things such as “following one’s passion,”
“changing the world” or, worst of all,
“helping people” are pursuits for those
who do not understand ﬁmdamentally
where happiness, well-being and the foun-
dations of our inﬁnitely developed society
come from.

But that is not to say that such disci-
plines have no uses, as individual classes

 
 

among them can be useful in building a
more “holistic” resumé. Kelli Grant of
CNBC suggests nontechnical classes in
theater arts, leadership studies and profes-
sional writing to provide communication
and interpersonal skills. Such abilities al-
low one to permanently aiﬁx the premium
buzzword “holistic” to their resume, and
with the OCC green cord, a job-seeker may
transcend from merely a “college gradu-
ate” to a “holistic intellectual.” ’

To live a happy, worthwhile life, one
must earn a high income, which requires
one to become a “holistic intellectual” with
particularly strong quantitative qualities
while in college. Hence, we have discovered
the true purpose of higher education and
discovered an explanation of Einstein’s
quote: “Education is what remains after
one has forgotten what one has learned in
school.” What remains, and what is of the
utmost importance, is the increase in sal-
ary we receive for the education we pursue.

If you wish to improve your abilities
outside the quantitative ‘disciplines toward
the ultimate goal of achieving “holistic
intellectual” status, contact Rohith at
rop33@pitt.edu.

SBRGWN

In this way, the status of the institu-
tion can rebound to one of real desirabil-
ity. The chance to explore a workspace
with no background and no credentials
can and should be common to college
students, especially considering pro-
grams such as~Teach for America, the
Peace Corps and countless internships
that exist for current undergrads and
recent graduates.

These opportunities, however, largely
dry up in the more brutal climate of the
postgraduationjobrmarket. As time goes
on, the chances to enter a completely un-
familiar ﬁeld grow thinner and thinner.
Taking advantage of these chances
means not only expanding your skills,
but possibly even discovering the field
in which you want to work for the rest
of your life.

That is, until some college sophomore
volunteers to do it for free. I

marginalized by their country’s legal system.

Consequently, the diverse experience one
receives participating in this kind of ﬁeldwork
also equates to personal career advancement.

P For instance, when workingfor an NGO, net-

working opportunities are expansively sig-
niﬁcant. NGOs are constantly working_with
governments and international organizations,
meaning that your own personal contact list
can include members of the U.N. or the De-
partment of State. Despite that, the best thing
about networking within an NGO is that your
listwill include people who are all working to-
ward a common goal. Therefore, networking

within the NGO ﬁeld is based more on mutual V

respect than on competition as it often is in
the corporate world. '

This communal attitude that NGOs facili-
tate also translates into multiple opportunities
one has to improve his or her leadership skills.
One can lead a development project or com-
mittee very soon after joining. It all depends
on how willing you are and not necessarily
on your position within the organization’s

September 18, 20l“8 I The Pitt News I vwvvx/.pittnevve.com

hierarchy. In a relatively short amount of time,
you might be able to add the title of project
leader to your resumé.

Eventually this will add to your attractive-
ness for higher—up jobs within the NGO orfor
jobs within the U.N., EU or the U.S. govern-
ment. For one of the main aspects required
for these positions is experience, according
to the U.N. NGO Director Pam Perraud.

For now, to earn a good-starting position
with an NGO, of course a degree is h‘ighlyben—
eﬁcial, even more so if it entails a certiﬁcate in
a specialty area such as development or public
health. Also, language skills are a must, as you
will be working with people who, believe it
or not, do not speak English as their mother
tongue. However, when going into the NGO
ﬁeld your passion must match your patience.
You won’t exactly be rolling in cash when you
ﬁrst start —— you will be paid more in experi-
ence than actual money.

As I stated before, the main qualiﬁcation
higher—ups in this ﬁeld look for is N GO expe-
rience. So if it is your dream to work for the
U.N. or to become a diplomat, NGO work is
a fantastic way to set you on the right path
toward that goal. I
