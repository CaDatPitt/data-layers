Senior Men Will
Ballot For ODK
Award Nominees

Winner’s Name To Be Inscribed
On Border Of Special Walk
Between Cathedral, Chapel

 

Complete Election Code

From 9:30 until 3:30 o’clock
Friday, senior men will vote in
the ODK election for Senior
Award candidates. A booth on
the ﬁrst ﬂoor of Alumni hall will
be the central balloting station
for eligible voters.

“Every man who gets at least one
vote.” said George A. Roll, .Ed35,
president of the all-activities honor-
ary, “will be considered for the ﬁnal
choice. The Friday result will not
‘determine ‘the ultimate winner, but
will give the faculty committee choos-
ing the winner an indication of can-
didates’ popularity.”

A committee of eight juniors in-
cluding ODK and University Assem-
bly members will supervise the elec-
tion. After the group has turned the
totals over to Dr. Vincent VV. Lan-
fear, dean of men, active student par-
ticipation in the choice will cease.

Dr. Lanfear’s group, Dr. Omar C.
Held, personnel assistant to the dean
of the College, Robert D. Ayars, pro-
fessor of accounting, Vvilliam S.
Maulsby, head of the department of
journalism, and Walter J. Rome, for.
mer assistant dean of men, will begin
work Monday. Decision will be com-
pleted by the end of the month.

“After the George VVharton Pepper
prize and the University Award
lapsed,” Roll said yesterday, “ODK
felt that there remained a need for
recognizing the outstanding senior.
\Ve were unable to put the idea into
effect last year, but plans are now
complete for presentation of the hon-
or on Tap day.”

According to the fraternity head,
an ODK walk connecting the front
entrance of the Cathedral and Heinz
Chapel will be bordered by a. series
of granite blocks, on which will be
inscribed the names of the yearly
winners.

,-The complete election code will be
published in The Pitt News Friday,
deﬁnitizing voting and eligibility re-
quirements.

day afternoon under the auspices of
Pitt Players, for “An afternoon of
Dickens humor.” The program will

a delightful way of convincing every-
body of the same thing.”

‘Skepticism Of   Section 7A
Is Healthy,’ Biddle Asserts

Labor Head Advocates Collective Bargaining As More
Effective Form Of Social Control Than Codes

 

By Leah Stark

“Collective bargaining is a. better
method of social control than the codes
‘for ‘the United States because this
system of contract and agreement is
based more on the institutions of this
country,” according to Attorney Fran-
cis Biddle of Philadelphia, chairman
of the National Labor Relations board,
speaking before the Labor Problems
class Monday.

Attorney Biddle cited the codes as
attempts to control production which
has been curtailed; markets which
are shrinking; distribution which is
shriveling. They are partly successful
in accomplishing this, depending on
the industry, he remarked.

The labor head emphasized the fact
that collect.ive bargaining is not a
partnership because a partnership al-*
ways involves an agreement from
which labor terms are later derived.
“For that reason there can never be
collective bargaining until there is
equality between employee and em-
ployers. Industry has power; the
theory of Section 7a is to aid work-
ers to have equal power in order to
bargain effectively.” J'ohn L. Lewis,
leader of the coal workers, was cited
as an effective bargainer.

“To be skeptical with Section 721,
rather than raise it as the Magna
Carta of workers is a healthy condi-
tion,” stated Mr. Biddle. This labor
mediator explains this characteristic
of the American people because of
their general belief in a “paper con-

Councilman Kane
Inquiry Speaker

“Mayor. Or City Manager Plan”
Topic At Meeting Today

“Something should be done to bet-
ter the city government.”

This is the opinion of John J. Kane,
city councilman, who will discuss
“The mayor or city manager plan” at
the weekly meeting of Inquiry forum,
which will be held at 12:30 o’clock
today in Room 107, Alumni hall.

Mr. Kane refused to be quoted in
regard to his attitude on the Ripper
bill, which is now before the state
legislature, and which if passed will
oust Mayor M.cNair from office.

While favoring some change, he
stated that the "l\'Ietropolitan plan”
by which the city and county would
be governed by a. board of commis-
sioners elected from the county at
large does not meet with his approval.

Students who are planning to attend
are requested to be in Room 107
promptly at 12:30 o'clock.

Favors For Men
Too-—-Jnnovaiion

At Military Bali

“Double value for your molley” is
the mottoof this year’s Military Ball.
‘Whether or not it is a money-back
guarantee has not yet been discovered.

The basis of this motto is that the
men, as well as the women, will re-
ceive favors.‘ The women’s favors,
according to one of the Ba1l’s press
agents, are “even nicer than last
year's.” The men’s will be “appro-
priate, nice, etc.” Although these
descriptions are a triﬂe ambit-$110118,
the fact remains that the men will re-
ceive something more than a sizable
dent in the weekly allowance.

This is the ﬁrst time in the recent
history of the University
favors have been presented at any
dance. The orchestras have not been
selected as yet. The date set is
March 22.

Today Is Pay-Day

The “Big Parade” starts today.

Beginning early this morning,
600 student FERA workers will
form a long l.ine to the Treasur-
er’s oiﬁce at 7 State hall to get
their January checks.

According to announcement
from the Treasurer, adequate
preparations have been made to
handle the rush.

 

Dent, Engineer lnformals To Compete
For Social Spotlight Friday Night

University students are asked to
take their choice of two dances Fri-
day. The odds are about even; the
Engineering Association offering a 19-
piece local orchestra, a girl vocalist,
and novel lighting effects, all for $1
a couple. The Dental Interfraternity
Council will give the dancers a 12-
piece imported broadcasting orches-
tra, three male vocalists, a singing en-
semble, and a campus site, all for $2
a couple. Take Your choice, and buy
tickets in the School of Dentistry for
the Dent dance and in the dean of
men's office, or the Engineering office,
‘Thaw hall, for the Engineering Asso-
ciation affair. Tickets for both dances
may be obtained from William Daufen-
bach in Alumni hall.

Buzzy Kountz will play at the En-
gineering Association dance at the
Grotto from 9 to 1 o’clock. Miss Helen

Stanley will be the featured vocalist,
Jack S. Robson, technical manager of
Pitt Players, has arranged the light-
ing for the dance. Two powerful spot.-
lights and a. revolving color wheel will
be utilized. Charles M. Harnish,
EE35, is chairman of the dance.
Teddy Brewer and his orchestra
will supply the music for the Dental
affair. It will be held in the Georgian
room of Webster Hall hotel from 9 to
1 o’clock. Karl P. Derr, 35, and Zelly
C. Alpert, 36, co-chairmen, have tenta-
tively arranged for a half-hour broad-
cast of the dance over a local broad-
casting station. Brewer has broadcast
coast to coast from the Village Barn,
and Young’s Chinese-American Res-
taurant, New York City. He has also

stitution" as the almighty protector
of "natural rights.” The sooner labor
organizes and learns to ﬁght its own
battles, the better its condition will
be, asserted Attorney Biddle.

In explaining -the Weirton case de-
cision. the speaker said. “Most district
judges are Republicans, and most Re-
publicans are not in sympathy with
the New Deal. However, the Supreme
Court does not pay much attention to
district court decisions.”

The removal of the Blue Eagle was
mentioned as a silly penalty. “The
eagle was devised as a temporary
slogan, but the symbolic stage of the
New Deal is past. A different punish-
ment is needed today; for instance, an
administrative tribunal with no,pro-
visions for review.” Attorney Biddle
warned against making a “prohibition
fiesta” out of the New Deal plan. He:
advises that a new system of govern-
ment should be enforced on the Amer-
ican people from a psychological
viewpoint.

He is opposed to the company union
and employe representation as col-
lective bargaining methods because he
feels that as long as the employe’s po-
sition is inse_cure, he can not bargain
effectively with his employer.

the Philadelphia bar, assistant to the

United States attorney, chairman of ‘

the Foreign Policy Association of
Philadelphia, member of Governor
Pinchot’,-:. commission, and secretary
to Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes of
the Supreme Court.

John \Veber, University busi-

Eberllarter Bill
Due For Reading

Investigation Measure Expected
Tonight Or Tomorrow

A bill calling for a. State Legislature
investigation. of academic freedom at
the University was expected out of
committee last night, according to As-
semblyman Herman P.’ Eberharter,
sponsor of the measure. It was
thought the bill would reach second
reading in the lower house tonight.‘
or tomorrow.

“I expect no particular opposition
to the measure,” Mr. Eberharter said,
explaining that no question of an ap-
propriation was involved at this time.
He continued:

“It. is too early to discuss the appro-
priation bill or to determine whether
conditions may be attached to the
Sta.te’s grant. I think the Legislature
will want to make its own investiga-
tion. Of course, I may be in for a
surprise.” '

Meanwhile, members of the- faculty
and administration were on record as
welcoming “any fair-minded, honest

investigation.”

Gulliver Travels Again
By Gulliver

I-IE LILLIPUTIAN led me down a long ﬂight of stairs, and when
we had reached the bottom we both stood dwarfed by a black
mass of rollers, wheels and gears. The little man declared at once

that it was a sort of machine called a newspaper press, and he point-
ed to where others of his kind were weaving a broad ribbon of white

paper, over and under, through the length of the machine.

The faces of these paper-weavers, and indeed the face of my
guide, were peaked and furtive in the greenish light. My guide told
me that familiarity with distortion had worn these characters into
their faces, but it was an explanation I could 11ot understand until
later.

I stared at the machine, for it not only dwarfed the Lilliputians
butit made me feel very small. A strong smell of oil and paper and
ink made a certain impulse in my mind, and I would have taken one
of the polished metal wheels in my hands. But the little man tugged
at my coat and piped that the presses were about to start. \Vhile
I bent down, he cried in my ear that everything that ever happened
in Lilliput came in a daily stream of printed words from the big
black rollers, and that nearly half the people of Lilliput, discarding
their holy scriptures and the works of their historians, philosophers
and poets, read nothing else but the works of these presses.

As he spoke a low rumble came from the rollers and they com-
menced to revolve slowly, and then faster. The floor trembled as
they gathered speed, and a11 arc of white paper ﬂashed across my
sightso fast that the printed words were nothing but a blur.

I thought of the Words of my guide, that everything that hap-
pened in Lilliput became print and truth for the Lilliputians through
the medium of this machine; and then I thought of some of the trou-
blcs of Lilliput and how this wonderful newspaper press was setting
them right again. I remembered the haggard poverty of millions of
the little people, while wheat was burned, while milk was poured in
ditches, while cotton was ploughed under—so that much less wheat
and milk and cotton could be sold at a proﬁt. I remembered lines of
people standing idle because there was no "work they could do for a
proﬁt, among them many young persons still wearing shroudlike
academic gowns and clutching in their hands the beautiful sheepskin
certiﬁcates of their preparedness for useful life. I remembered the
threats of a foreign war, raised by makers of cannons and powder to
their own proﬁt. And I swayed with an emotion of joy to hear the
steady rumble of the great press, as it beat out its printed burden
of intelligence and truth.

At that ‘moment I had not been aware that my Lilliputian had
left me, until he came running toward me with a ﬁnished copy of
their newspaper. I took it eagerly and I read:

“John Strachey, English author and lecturer, arrived in
this country on Tuesday. He had hardly stepped ashore from
the steamship Aquitania when he said of President Roosevelt
and the latter ’s program, ‘He is politically clever, but the inevit-
able results will be disastrous.’ This man should be ordered to
leave the country at once.”

I read that university students should be blindfolded for four

;'years while phonographic robots drilled into their ears the words of

patriotic songs, ending always with the refrain: “And keep us all
in our proper places.” I read that war should be threatened against
a race of islanders 4,000 miles away, unless they surrendered their
buying and selling to the Lilliputians. I would have read further,
but that the nausea overtook me and I was obliged to seek the air.

Out in the sun again, I remembered the words of one of the

Lilliputians’ honored geniuses, who had written a book called

“Huckleberry Finn,” who also wrote:

“My kind of loyalty was to one’s country, not to its insti-
tutions. The country is the real thing, the eternal thing. In-
stitutions are extraneous, they are its more clothing, and clotl1-
ing can wear out, become ragged. To be loyal to rags, that is a
loyalty to unreason. It belongs to monarchy; let monarchy keep
it. The citizen who thinks he sees that the Commonwealth’s
clothes are worn out, and yet holds his peace and does not
agitate for a new suit, is disloyal; he is a. traitor.”

And I recalled what another of their geniuses had written, this
a man whom they honored as their “martyred president :”

“This Country, with its institutions, belongs to the people
who inhabit it. \Vhenever they shall grow weary of the existing
government, they can «exercise their constitutional right of
amending it, or their revolutionary right to dismember or over-
throw it.” — "

And I wondered whether the presses, rumbling down there,
could drown out the thought.

Wanted—A Red Algae
Around The Copy Desk

By ROMAN LAPICA

Linguist

Twenty—one-year-old Achilles J.
Spina, who registered last September
as a freshman, today became a junior
in the “College.

It was no sleight-of-hand trick
either. Everything was legitimate
and above-board. Spina merely took
certain examinations in French, Ital-
lan and Spanish and the faculty de-
cided to advance him.

The secret lies in Spina's recent
three-year stay in Europe. The Bos-
well, Pa., linguist studied French in
Paris, Italian in Rome, and Spanish
in Madrid.

Adventure not only awaited Spina
but actually followed him around the
continent. In Spain he stepped over
a dead body into a “hue1ga”—strike.
In Paris he was walking through the
Place de la. Concorde on February 7
when army machine guns broke loose
and killed men about him. The day
he landed in Amsterdam Communists
at*empted a coup d’etat.

Mr. Spina, who also spent three
years in Europe when between 11 and
14 years of age, is an accomplished
pianist. In his spare moments he
reads Moliere, Dante, Cervantes ‘and
other authors in the original. He has
only one criticism of Pittsburgh:

“It is too. small!”

Photography

Luke Swank‘s new course in jour-
nalistic photography_ which began in-
auspiciously this semester, seems on
the road to becoming one of the most
popular minor subjects in the col-
lege.

Originally meant for journalism
students only, the course now has 25
registered. Three new $150 graph-
lex cameras are to come this week.
Each student will have to take his
own pictures, develop them and make
prints to pass the course. Mr. Swank
said:

“This isn’t going to be a snap
course by any means. Pictures
will have to be a ‘little’ better
than the first roll developed by a
certain Pitt News columnist!”

Mr, Swank now has 37 photos on
exhibition on the third floor of the
Gulf building in which one gem is

typical of his work — a clean sharp
photo of a street lamp hanging from
a pole. '

Mr. Swank has had pictures accept-
ed in exhibitions from Los Angeles
to New York. None has ever been
shown twice. About photographing
he said.

“The biggest difficulty is no*J”‘find-

ing suitable scenes. It's trying to
keep people out of your pictures.”

Up in liittanning, Mr. Swank wait-

ed around for an hour to get a “clear”
picture of the courthouse. Just as he
was about to snap the shutter, 23. man
came out of the door, found what was
going on and declared:

“Pm a county commissioner. If
there's any picture taken here,
I’m going to be in it."

Wanted—A Red Algae

The botany department today has
reached the stage where it is willing
to pay good money for a specimen of
red algae, genus Polysiphonia.

Dr. W. H. Emig, associate pro-
fessor, has “scoured the country”
in attempts to secure the male,
female and tetrasporic plants of
Polysiphonia. Every major sup-
ply company has been solicited.
Private collectors have been writ-
ten. Nothing‘suitable has been
received so far. ~
The department wants the algae fo

slide-making purposes. The algae are
a small marine plant about six inches
high, found only in salt water.

Accordinr: to Dr. Richard W. Mor-
rissey, graduate assistant, the depart-
ment today has about 10,000 slides
valued at more than $400. The oldest
slides are those of diatomes made
back in 1893. The department makes
over 1,000 new slides every year.
About 200 are broken or ruined in
class work.

Dr. Morrissey explained that 11
distinct steps are required to turn
out a slide suitable for laboratory
work. The whole process takes
about a month. The department
uses 18 stains although 400 have
been tried.

Each slide is worth from 30 cents
to $1 depending on the difficulty in
getting tissue.

 

Around the Copy Desk

The journalism department has
gone into mourning. On a recent ex-
am in which the students were allow-
ed to answer anything they knew,
one aspiring Greeley wrecked the
course by writing:

“There are 15.000
words in a column."

From downtown Pittsburgh comes

the tale about Dr. B. J. Hovde. public
relations director, history professor,
and liberal. A group of unemployed.
displeased about something, “picket-
ed” the county building. On the
signs was written:

“Down with Mellon and Hovdel”
But The Pitt News, as usual, scoops

the town. Some one turned in the
following for an editorial:

“The news of Pitt we tell the
latest. Writ in perfectly style and
most earliest. Do a dance be held
we hear of it and tell it. Do a
mighty dean die. we publish it, and
in border somber. Staff has each
been colleged and write like the
Banks or Maurer. We circle one
classroom and extorticnate not for
advertisements.”

Pitt’s War Patriotism Reviewed By Lloyd

The Pitt Weekly Carried “Fascinating Stories Of Surging
Emotions” And The Trials Of The Student Body

By Alan C. Lloyd

HERE ‘WAS A TIME, not too far in the University's past to be recalled,
when Pitt's campus was a volcano of patriotism and high feeling. It was
before the Cathedral was more than a. dream.
mottled the ﬁeld where terraces and walks and hopes are widespread. It was
while Heinz House, the old one, was beside State hall, looking much like
‘the present one. It was the time when our football team still Won champion-
ships in Forbes Field, and talk of a Stadium was small.

 

Tennis courts and shacks still

The University still

a rough ﬁeld at the top of the bill, a
ﬁeld demolished when the Stadium
was constructed.

It was 1918, war-time. The Pitt
Weekly of 1918 tells fascinating
stories in weekly installments,
stories of surging emotion, stories
of reported heroisms abroad, stories
of an adventurous student body with
a do-or-die spirit, stories . . ..

# $ *

It is an impressive scene. On the
greensward before Memoi-ia.l hall, ﬁve
thousand youths stand at attention. A
thousand or so are in brown uniform,
' and they stand in
perfect lines from
street to -street,
heels digging into
the turf. The
others are students
from all over the
city. There are
over 3,500 of them,
dressed in grey
and blue and light
brown suits, “cits”
they call them, and
of these 3,500 at
least half are Pitt
students.

Behind the pyra-

Alan Uoyd mid of the Hall,

the hill rises green and round into a
bright. fall sky. Alumni Hall has not
yet been built. To the sides are Thaw
hall and the trees along the streets.
An oﬂicer on the rostrum looks at his
watch, raises his arm; it falls andthe
band crashes into :1 chorus of the
“Star Spangled Banner” that echoes
over the heads of the silent, erect
men. Slowly the ﬂag moves up the
white pole. The boys almost forgot
to hold their eyes steady, and slowly
chins raise as thousands of eyes fol-
low the ﬂag up. Then, repeating word
by word the oath of the oiﬁcer, the
3,500 swear by their honor to support
the ﬂag of their nation.

At the same time, at 500 colleges
and universities throughout the
country, young. men-—150,000 of
them-—were repeating exactly the
same ceremony, for it is October
first, noon, of 1918. And this was
the start of the Students’ Army
Training COl‘p$—-42 days before the
Armistice . . .

$ * ﬂ

At no time before or since has the
Pitt campus beenso energetic. There
were but about 2500 students in the
undergraduate body, and of these 500
were coeds. Following the ceremony,
the men wore uniforms. A training
base was made on Fricks acres, and
here the men went through an exag-
gerated Rotacee course, preparatory
to oﬂicership. The coeds formed
knitting societies, and sold Liberty
Bonds.

At the orders of the military depart-
ment, all fraternities were closed.
This was almost a necessity, for most
of the fraternity men were already in
camp, and those who were not were
not to be molly-coddled. Many Pitt
‘orotherhoods enlisted in a body. Some
Cynics thought the occasion had ar-
rived for the prohibition of fraternal-

 

had a baseballteam, and it played 011$

ism, just as others pushed the matter
of liquor prohibition. Time has proved
those cynics to be wrong. Sororities
were still in existence, and many went
to the aid of their related brother-
hoods in ﬁnancial and practical ways.
VVomen’s classes were held although
many of the men’s were dropped.
Throughout the last few months of
the war. the college catalogues are
full of “Coursesdropped for the dura-
tion of the war.” since many of Pitt’s
instructors donned the uniform - .

& $ 3
Throughout these times two great
Pitt institutions had functioned
regularly: the football team had

practiced, and The Pitt Weekly ‘had
appeared each Wednesday.

The football team, under the hand
of Pop W'arner, had been drilling while
in the campus, rather pessimistically,
it must be admitted. As long as the
quarantine existed, no games. or any
assemblies of the public could be held.
Yet, hoping against all chances, Pop
had kept his team in condition.
Schedules were abandoned and the
season looked like a failure, when, in
the middle of November, the ban was
raised, and Pitt started to town. The
trip ended with a great defeat of
Georgia. Tech to the tune of 32 to 0.
The city papers echoed the Vveekly in
claiming for the Panthers the cham-
pionship of the world. Few denied
the cry.

Another sigiiiﬁcant thing was the
weakness of editorial policy. Little
mention was made of the history then
being enacted, and at the time of the
enrollment of the boys, the editor
wrote merely that:

“As we advance into the military
‘habit, we will find a certain charm
about it that will make early rising
and various discomforts of the first
few weeks seem less irksome. Just
set your teeth and fight and resolve
to ‘take it out on Germany'.”

Let us pray that they are gone for
good, those spirited Pitt days.

Goes To Washington

 

Dr. John M. Ferguson, assistant pro-
fessor of economics, leaves for VVash-
ington tomorrow midnight on a
week's business trip. He will confer
with public oﬁicials there and visit
New York before he returns.

THAT? THE
eov FRIEND

I Intercollegiate I

By Ray Scheib
A Radical’s Haven

A haven for students expelled from
college for radicalism or for express-
ing opinions in print has just been
uncovered. At Commonwealth col-
lege of Mona, Ark., radical opinion is
taken for granted. Officials of the
college have also made it clear that
any student objecting to freedom of
expression on the campus will imme-
diately be sent home.

Terms
The University of ‘Minnesota ex-
perimented with a shorter school term
during the past semester. The school
year was divided into quarters in-
stead of halves. Now the students
are asking for a return to the old sys-
tem. Unoﬂicial reports have it that
the work is too concentrated. There

are too many quizzes.

Some Class

After all these years, the Harvard
authorities are beginning to wonder
where the Harvard accent comes
from. Experiments are now under
way to discover how the Harvard stu-
dent acquires it. Freshmen are re-
quired to make a victrola record of
their speech upon entering the univer-
sity and another upon leaving it, for
comparison.

When you were chewing that board-
ing-house steak last night, you knew
it was hard work, but did you know
that you used between 60 and 80

Panthers Meet

Georgetown

In Windup Of Home Season

Cribbs, Hughes, Wainio To Play Ball Before Home Folks '

For Last Time In Battle With Hoyas Tonight

By William K. Trosen
Pittsburgh district cage followers will get their last chance to
see Dr. Carlson put his Panther basketball team through its paces
when the Golden Panthers stack up against Fred i\Iesmer"s George-

town quintet at the stadium tonight in the season ’s ﬁnal home game.
The Panthers, in addition to wishing to close a successful series of
home games, have their eyes glued on their third straight Eastern

Intercollegiate conference title in

Although the Panthers have two
more games remaining on their away
schedule, tonight's battle will ﬁnd the
two Pitt co-captains, Claire Cribbs
and Skippy Hughes, winding up their
basketball careers in a blue and gold
uniform at the stadium. Both Cribbs

and Hughes have been "‘Pantlier*stars'

for several seasons, ranking with the
best when speaking of district stars,
or even better than that. Sliin Wainio,
ace sharpshooter who again proved
his worth in Saturday's battle with
Tech, will get his last chance to show
before the home folks.

It has been only two weeks since
the Panthers journeyed to Washing-
ton, D. C. and brought back an easy
42-24 victory over the Georgetown
team and Mesmer and his boys have
fond dreams of pulling an upset and
hanging one on the Panther’s chin for
a change. Another win over the
Hoyas and the Panthers would virtual-
ly assure themselves of the confer-
ence title while Georgetown would
(-.ertainly be doomed for the cellar
position in the ﬁnal league standing.

Panthers Lead Conference

At present, as a result of its 36-31
whipping handed Carnegie Tech last
Saturday, the Panthers sport a fairly
secure hold on the top post in the con-
ference with ﬁve victories and one d_e-
feat. The only remaining team In
the league that stands a chance of
sharing the title with the Panthers is
‘West Virginia, having won four of its
six conference battles. In case the
Mountaineers plaster one on the Cats,
the best VVest Virginia could gain is
a tie for the championship.

Getting back to Georgetown, Coach
Fred Mesmer and his boys have
found the going rough this season in
the matter of winning games. To date
the Hoyas have dropped 10 of the 16
games on their schedule. Included in
the 16 games are six conference tilts,
of which the Georgetown team has
managed to come out on top only
once. However. Georgetown has
shown ﬂashes of brilliant basketball
this season, the highlights being a tri-
umph over Tech and a victory over
the Yale varsity that broke New York
university’s 27-game winning streak
earlier in the season.

"In coming to Pittsburgh Mesmer
brings one of the East's outstanding
basketball players in Ed Hargaden,
captain of the Georgetown team. Har-
gaden is leading the conference in in-
dividual scoring and has been chosen
for the all-conference team for the
last two seasons. He is a great all-
around player, being hdept at defense
and offense work.

Pitt's Home Record Perfect

Teaming with Hargaden at the for-

" wards is Don Gibeau, a sophomore

and a clever, speedy ﬁoorman. The
center post is taken care of by
Charlie Parcells, six foot, one inch
senior. Joe Corless, a ﬁne defensive
player, and Ben Zola, sophomore star,
are teamed at the guard positions.
Tonight’s game is the ninth home
ganie for the Panthers and thus far
the Golden Cats have whipped seven
of the eight teams met here. The one
loss was a 27-25 defeat at the handsof
Duquesne. However, this game was
regularly scheduled on the Dukes’
ﬂoor but was moved to the stadium to
accomodate a greater crowd, so that
really the Panthers have won all of
their scheduled home games this sea-
son. '

’ Bye Basketball,
Hello Football;
[HS Spring Drill

To the boys and girls on the side-
walks this season of the year may

mean rope-skipping, marble-shooting
and kite-ﬂying, but to Dr. John B.
Sutherland and his staff of assistant
football coaches it means the time
has come to start ﬁnding some ﬁrst
class guards, tackles, ends and backs.

All of which means that spring foot-
ball practice is about to begin. Dr.
Sutherland will open the ﬁrst practice
of the spring training program on
Monclay, March 18, weather permit-
ting. All members of last year’s var-
sity and freshman teams are expect-
ed to report for the ﬁrst drill. This
in no way means that only members
of last year’s squads may try out for
the te:-1:11. Dr. Sutherland wishes to
make it emphatic that every student
in the University desiring to try out
for a position on next seasoii’s var-
sity is more than welcome to attend
the practices.

Equipinent will be issued by Percy
St. Claire Browne, custodian of equip-
ment_ in the Stadium dressing room
on Friday, March 15.

Students interested in the mana-
gerial end of football are requested to
report to either Stew iVIcAwley or Joe
Rodgers in the Stadium dressing
room on Monday, March 11, between
3:30 and 5 o’clock. Students who
qualify for the positions may ﬁnd
themselves on the coast next winter
watching the Panthers stopping the
Trojans. Past apprentice managers
will receive numerals this week.

Olson To Send Strong Panther
Squad To Midwest Meet
At Notre Dame Home

Pleased by Bonavita’s showing in
the National Intercollegiates at New
York last Saturday but slightly dis-
appointed in the performance of the
mile-relay team, Coach Carl Olson has
tried to iron out the weak spots in
the runners’ form to bring them
around to top shape for the ninth an-
nual Central lntercollegiate track and
ﬁeld meet at South Bend, Indiana,
next Friday and Saturday. The squad
will leave tomorrow afternoon.

Olson plans to enter a strong team
in this coming track carnival which
was won last year by the runners
from Michigan State. The Panthers
finished third, one notch behind Notre
Dame.

In last year’s event, the Olsonmen
competed_with a. fair amount of suc-
cess, scoring 141,/2 points and breaking
one meet record. The relay team of
Kigel‘, Keller, MacDonald, and Con-
nelly. cracked the mile-relay mark
running the distance in 3 minutes,
24.2 seconds. 011 the basis of per-
formances this season, the Pitt baton-
passers should erase this record. Last
Saturday, in the qualifying heat of
the 1600-meter relay, the relayers
ran the event in 3 minutes, 24.1 sec-
onds. In the ﬁnals of that event, the
lads ran the distance under their time
established in the trials. although
their efforts gave them only a third
place.

Announce Plans
For Cage Finals

League-Leaders, Runners-Up Vie
In Intramural Playoff Tilts

Tentative plans for the playoff in
Intramural basketball to determine
the champion have been drawn up by
Mr. Feeley, athletic head of this ﬁrst
successful tourney.

Feeley plans to include the league
“A” and league “B” Greek champs,
the Dent School league winner, Med
School winner, Engineer and Indepen-
dent iliialists, and the runners—up in
the Independent, Engineering, “A”
and “B” divisions.

“A,” “B,” Dent, Med, Engineer, and
Independent champs will automatical-
ly be placed in the quarter-ﬁnal round.
The second-place clubs will play one
round before reaching the quarter-
ﬁnals. This playoif will produce two
teams for the quarter-ﬁnal round,
bringing this round to a capacity limit
of eight teams.

In the top quarter-ﬁnal contest, the
two Greek champs will battle for the
right to enter semi-ﬁnal play. It is
also in the plans to play the Dent
winner and Med winner for the sec-
ond semi-ﬂnalist. The Engineers’ and
Independent clubs play for the third
berth, and out of the four second-
place clubs, one team will emerge to
the select round of four.

In regards to league play, Mr.
Feeley was “very well pleased with
the ﬁne cooperation, sportsmanship,
and 100 per cent interest of the teams
throughout the entire tourney. Intra-
mural athletics are now well on their
way to becoming a deﬁnite part of
the SD0I‘tS 1>I‘0gram of this Univer-
sity,” he concluded.

The Pitt News

Boxers Prepare
For Navy Battles

Slade Cutter, Of Football Fame,
To Appear As Heavyweight

Following their defeat at the hands
of Wisconsin at the Stadium Satur-
day night, Coach Jack Schricker put
his Pitt varsity boxers through light
workouts Monday and Tuesday nights.
The Panthers’ next match will be Sat-
urday night when they meet Navy at
the Stadium.

All of the Pitt boxers came out of
the \Visconsin match in good shape.
Linderman has entirely recovered
from the injury which he sustained
when he struck his head o_n the apron
board of the ring in falling, and will
be in shape to meet Cutter, the Navy
heavyweight.

Coach Schricker has been putting
Zivak, Paslowski, and Dines through
stiff sessions in the art of in-ﬁghting
and ‘counter-punching.

Captain Jimmy Giannatti, who has
not been beaten ‘yet this year, will at-
tempt to add victory number six to
his winning streak. He defeated
George Stupar, Badger representative
in the 135-pound division, in one of
the feature bouts of the Wisconsin
match. It was the ﬁrst defeat which
the Madison boy has suffered in three
years of Intercollegiate competition.

The Middies will be represented by
one of the ﬁnest teams in the history
of the ring sport at the Naval school.
In beating Syracuse, six to two, a
team which parlier in the season
whipped the Panthers, they stamped
themselves as one of the leading con-
tenders for the Eastern title.

Much interest should come from the
appearance of Slade Cutter in the lo-
cal boxing ring. Cutter is remem-
bered as the fellow who played a
whale of a tackle against the Panther
gridinen last fall. He is also the boy
who kicked the ﬁeld goal to sink the
Army later in the season.

Jimmy De Hart Dies

J iinmy De Hart, one of the two men
ever to win letters in four varsity
sports at Pitt, died Monday night in
\Vinston-Salem. North Carolina, fol-
lowing an abdominal operation.

De Hart is one of Pitt’s football im-
mortals, having starred on the famous
team of 1916.

numbered Manhattan, Franklin and
Marshall, Tech, and Delaware among
their victims in dual meets.

-Coach Pat Corr will enter a full
team in the meet. The Panthers will
be represented by Stinner and Rulie

Pi Kappa Alpha, Kappa Sigma Must
Win Tonight To Stay In Title Chase

Pi Kappa Alpha and Kappa Sigma
cage teams will have t.o win tonight if
championship title considerations go
to either ﬁve.

Here is the League “B” setup: Phi
Kappa, Pi Kappa Alpha, and Kappa
Sigma at present are tied for the pole
position with three wins and one de-
feat each.

Kappa Sigma defeated both teams,
but the Phi Kap game was defaulted
when it was learned George Shotwell,
playing in that game, was ineligible
for Interfraternity competition due to
mid-semester graduation. Pi Kappa
Alpha whipped Phi Kappa, 28 to 20, on
February 26.

This brings play up to the ﬁnal
three contests, scheduled for tonight‘
in the Trees Gymnasium. Phi Delta
Theta, which has won but one game
(and that on a default from SAE) will
hardly stop Pi Kappa Alpha in the 7

o’clock game. "-Kappa‘ Sigma will meet . »

a stiffer test in the second game
against Lambda Chi Alpha.

Phi Kappa will get a forfeit victory
from Sigma Alpha Epsilon, since the
SAE’s have dropped out of the
leagiie. Therefore, the very least the
Phi Kap-’s can expect is a three-way
tie with Pi K A and Kappa Sigma.

Tomorrow night, the penultimate

Opinions Differ
As Seniors Seek
Uniform Dresses

 

Muster Day Will Decide Styles,‘

Set Dance Date, Present
Class Program Booklet

 

Senior women are still being" inter-
viewed as to their wishes for the
academic dress to be chosen next
week at senior Muster day. Accord-
ing to incomplete returns from the
interviews. the seniors are far from
agreeing as to the style of academic
dress desired.

The materials that have been pro-
posed by various members of the class
for the dresses include cotton, silk,
crepe, acetate, and boucle. The style
of the dress varies, according to
preference, from long-sleeved ones to
sleeveless jacketed frocks.

However, ﬁnal decision as to two
alternate styles must be made at the
senior style show next Wednesday
afternoon. Because of this, it is im-
portant that every woman who in-
tends to graduate in June should be
present at the show even if it is ne-
cessary to miss a class.

In considering the social program
for the remainder of the year, there
has been some sentiment to the effect
that a dance for sophomores is im-
practical. Although no deﬁnite action
will be taken before Muster day, there
is a possibility that a senior dance on
the night of graduation may be
planned to rep-lace the proposed sopho-
more dance. i

As a project of the Academic dress
committee, a booklet containing the
class Program and probable expenses
necessary before Commencement will
be distributed during the Muster day

-program.

Senior women are urged to pay up
their class dues, for no person may
vote at the spring elections unless
dues are paid in full. Louise Birn-
krant is class treasurer.

solved, that the nations should agree
to prohibit the international shipment
of arms and munitions.”

Home debates are scheduled later

the negative team, composed of a rep-
resentative of each school, won. The

bate had drawn the largest crowds on
record for an intercollegiate debate.

WSGA To Fete
Pre-College Club

High School Women To Learn
, About University At Tea

 

—-——‘-r
The social committee of VVSGA will
entertain approximately sixty girls
from the Go—To-College club sponsor-
ed by the Girls Reserves of Cl-airton

' High School at tea Thursday at Heinz

House at 3:30 o’clock.

The club members have expressed
a. desire to meet prominent campus
women, to learn something of campus
life, and to see what the University
has to offer students seeking a higher
education.

Hazel Lincoln, president of WSGA,
will address the group. A quartet from
the VVomen’s Chorale will offer a
musical program, and the freshman
dramatic unit has been asked to pre-
sent a short play.

The social and the executive com-
mittees of WSGA,_ and two members
from each freshman unit will serve
as aides. Margaret Lewis is in charge
of the program. The quartet is com-
posed of Annabelle Knupp-. C37, Eliza-
beth Creese, C37, Carolyn Hall, E-d36,
and Louise Loughner, C35.

 

Keeping Juvenile
Delinquents Happy
Is Job, Says Aide

Providing ‘entertainment for half a
hundred boys of all ages and sizes is
no easy job, according to Erck Man-
terﬁeld, C37, whose job it is to keep
the week-end boarders at the Juvenile
Detention Home, Fifth avenue, in
good spirits.

l\/Ianterﬁeld must ﬁnd someone who
can and is willing to come on Sunday
evening to the Juvenile Detention
home and spend an hour or two en-
tertaining the boys. He’s been doing
the job now for almost two years and
it. hasn’t got any easier in that time.

Although the Juvenile Detention
home usually has a daily turnover,
the situation is a little different over
the week—er.d. The boys must stay
there until some time Monday and
time hangs a bit heavy on their
hands.

The inmates are divided into two
classes, delinquents and dependents,
and range from babies to 18 year olds.
Sixty to 7 5 boys are there at all times.

1\~Iagicians. according to Monter-
ﬁeld, are much more in demand than
any other type of entertainer, al-
though motion pictures -do‘ run a close
second. Stanley Rogaliner, C37, per-
formed there last year and gained the
enthusiastic admiration of the audi-
ence. \V. W’. Mendenhall, executive
secret-.1ry oi’ the YMCA, not long ago
presented some slides of India.

Manterﬁeld thinks his work done
at the home has been “a lot of fun.”

“The hard work is getting enter-
tainers,” he said. “VVe have about
run out. of- magicians, and we have
had great difficulty trying to get radio
entertainers. Radio entertainers
have an artists’ service bureau to
take care of their engagements, and
we have to contact them personally.
Usually they are out of town on Sun-
day evening.
