Rep. Cowell

receives ACLU

liberty award

By Michael King
Staff Writer

The American Civil Liberties Union
presented the 1992 Civil Libertarian Award
to state Rep. Ron Cowell at the Pitt Law
School yesterday.

The ACLU praised Cowell for his
opposition of the Pennsylvania Abortion

». Control Act of 1989 and for his work to stop
the tuition voucher bill. By attempting to

stop this billfrom being passed, Cowell
was advocating the separation of church
and state in Pennsylvania’s school system,
ACLU representatives said.

Cowell is also known for sponsoring an
amendment to the state Right to Know act
which would require state—related schools
like Pitt to make their ﬁnancial records
public. Cowell is now serving his ninth
term in ’ the Pennsylvania House of
Representatives.

In his acceptance speech, Cowell
reminisced about his undergraduate days
at Pitt when political science classes
debated whether elected officials should
do what they feel is right or do what their
constituents want them to do.

He explained that at times, neither of
these can be done. Elected officials must
sometimes abandon personal feelings and
those of their constituents and turn to the
Constitution for legal answers, he said.

Pittsburgh Post—Gazette columnist Sally
Kalson praised the work of the American
Civil Liberties Union. She was the featured
guest speaker at the meeting.

Kalson, who has written award—winni_ng
political commentary, explained her
metaphorical view of the law working as a
swinging pendulum.

“Things are going to get a lot worse
before they get better,” she said. Kalson
thanked the ACLU for doing all it could to
make things better by “throwing their
weight against the pendulum.”

She said her support for the ACLU and its
work for basic human rights stemmed from
her childhood experiences.

Kalson’s father and uncles grew up in
the Hill District when the area housed
many different cultural groups. Their stories
of prejudice and class differences prepared
her for their families’ move to Mount

U.S. Representative Rick Santorum addresses students at the College Republicans’ seminar

Conference

Sug1]‘W7'ile1°

U.S. Rep. Rick Santorum
encouraged the College
Republicans’ efforts in the
upcoming presidential el—»v
ections and credited the group
for assisting his own successful
campaign two years ago.

Santorum was the keynote
speaker for the statewide
College Republicans weekend
last Friday night in the William
Pitt Union. I-le attributed many
of the nation’s problems to a
Democratic Congress.

“The reason why we still
have the problems we have in
this country is because we stifle
the economy,” he said. “It's
because we over-regulate and I
we over—tax.”

Santorum said President Bush
proposed a package to
Congress consisting of several
spending programs, middle-
income tax benefits and
targeted growth areas.

The Democrats in the House
applauded increased spending
and a balanced budget, which
seemed ironic to Santorum.

State senatorpledges sapportfor ROTC

By Katie Kaminski
Staff Writer '

State Sen. Mike Fisher said he will
continue working to keep Pitt’s ROTC
program despite concern that the military
discriminates against gays, lesbians and
bisexuals. Fisher spoke at the College
Republicans weekend Saturday.

“No matter what you think about the
Department of Defense’s policy, Pitt is a
public university," Fisher said. He said
his discussions with Pitt President J.

Dennis O’Connor‘ have been
“encouraging” so far.

CR president Jacinta Dvorak said the
CRs would help Fisher maintain the
ROTC program at Pitt.

“This is a battle. We have to keep
ROTC. We’re a publicly funded
university,” she said.

CR public—relations director Jonathan
Kurland asked Fisher to restate his
feelings about the Pitt Law School policy
of banning the military from recruiting at
the law school.

Fisher, who pledged last week to back
legislation that would lift the ban, said
he had written to O’Connor about the
possibility ofeliminating a campus-wide
ban on military recruiters. The nation
needs to support the military, said Fisher,
a veteran.

At the weekend Fisher also discussed
the importance of grass—roots
campaigning in winning elections.

Bill provides increasedfunding for international studies

By John Temple

For T be Pitt News

A recently signed bill will
increase opportunities for
university students to study
abroad, especially in Asia, Africa
and other areas not traditionally
covered by study—abroad
programs.

In its first year, the National
Security Act of 1991 will allocate
$15 million in study—abroad
scholarships. The government
had previously spent $3 million
per year for these programs, said

David Hoffman, an aide of Sen.
David Boren (D.-Okla.), who
authored the bill.

“We never saw any federal
money before,” said Annagene
Yucas, director of Pitt’s Study
Abroad Office. “So suddenly
having $15 million to apply for is
great.”

Because most students studying
abroad now must raise their own
funds, the act will increase
opportunities for a wider range
of students. Students planning to

, attenda foreign school for one or

two semesters will be able to

apply for federal aid.

“But it’s crucial that we let the
students know because there’s
$15 million out there that will be
spent in the next year,” said Yucas.
“I’ve been sitting here waiting for
information on how to apply for
it since I read the bill.”

Some specifics have yet to be
worked out, but Hoffman said
the first scholarships will be issued
this fall.

Priority will be given to students
going to countries not emphasized
in most study-abroad programs.
About three-fourths of American

college students studying abroad
right now are in the same five
West European countries,
according to Hoffman.

But this proposal will cause
some problems, says Yucas.
“Some of the critical areas that
the bill proposes sending students
to, like developing countries in
Africa for instance, don't have
programs that can support our
students,” she said. “There will
have to be a rush of preparation
in these areas before next year.”

The act sets up a fund that will
provide at least $4 million per

year for undergraduates after the
first year.

The act will also allocate'$10
million in the first year to provide
fellowships to graduate students
studying foreign languages and
area studies. Graduate students
receiving fellowships will be
required to teach or work for a
government agency for one or
three years for every year of the
fellowship.

As with the undergraduate
program, $4 million will be
provided every year after the first

incumbent in 1980, urged the
College Republicans to get
involved in upcoming political
campaigns.

Politicians are returning to the
grass-roots campaigning process,
going door to door and passing
out literature, he said.

The successful campaigns of
State Sen. Melissa Hart and Rep.
Rick Santorum are examples of
this type of strategy, Fisher said.
Both Hart and Santorum were
 , . , /J _ virtually unknown until they
 ” I  V ' ' I I became well-known through their
diligence and persistence,
according to Fisher.

“ICollege Republicans] are here
as an educational organization.
We have a job to educate.” Fisher
said this includes distributing
literature and discussing political
issues with people in the
community.

“We’re not forcing a political
idea down their throats. We’re
just offering them a good choice,”
he said.

him: Young Republicans, College
Republicans, senior citizens and
even some Democrats.

“I work for the people,” Fisher
said. “ You don’t [Campaign] on

Fisher announced that he will
be seeking re—election once again.
Fisher said aside from having
people solicit votes, it is also
important for candidates to make
themselves visible in the
community, making contacts and
attending community functions.

“It’s a great thing to be involved
in a political process,” according
to Fisher. Getting involved now,
he stressed, will enable students
to learn and remember the
principles of campaigning that
may be put to use later for those
who choose a career in politics.

Santorum

Continued from page 1

“How can you intellectually
applaud for more spending and
then have the gall to applaud for
a balanced budget?” Santorum
asked the group.

“That’s the hypocrisy that is the
Democratic Congress. They’re
demagogues, not Democrats,
because they will stand up and
talk about how we need a
balanced budget, we need to
reduce spending, and we need to
get this deficit under control, and
then do nothing about it.

“Every one of them wants to
balance the budget, every one of
them wants to reduce the deficit,
and every one of them wants to
spend more money.”

Santorum said the Democrats
don’t believe in creating wealth
and instead want to redistribute it
by taxing the “rich people.”

He said there is a difference
between those who see America
as a place where everyone has a
fair opportunity and a place where
everyone is equal, and that he
would like to see more job-
development programs.

“You can get rid of a lot of
poverty programs and a lot of
welfare and start putting the
money back in the hands of the
American families because they
know how to spend it better than
the government does,” he said.

Malpractice suits are getting
out of hand because appro-
ximately 20 percent of medical
costs come from “defensive

to Santorum.

Major reforms in the legal
system are also on Santorum’s
agenda. “Our civil-litigation
system costs this country more in

President Rob Nixon said
Santorum’s lecture was beneficial
to the group. “I think Rick
Santorum has a message to give
out,” Nixon said. “He is young,
and he has a lot of ideas, and he’s
not going to get caught up in the
stalemate of state party leadership.

“It’s a shame that a lot of
Republican and Democratic
leaders don’t want to have any
concrete ideas because they’re
afraid that they’re going to lose
out. [Santorum] comes out and
says what he feels, and he’s kind
of a hero to the College
Republicans because he gives us
ideals to fight for and we work
with him.”

Jonathan Kurland, Pitt CR public
relations director, said Santorum
inspires him to continue in politics.
“This is a man who whether you’re
Democrat or Republican, liberal

said. “The civil litigation system

Kurland said. “And he wants the
best thing for his country and for
his constituents.”

Santorum offered solutions to
the health—care crisis. He said
employers should give employees
the money they would spend on
insurance, and then have the
employees put the money in a
tax—free account to use as the
insurance deductible.

  Blame it onjapcm?

On the verge of an economic slump comparable to the
19305, Americans have been up in arms against all the
bugaboos “causing” the nation’s woes. Every institution is
subject to the microscope. But America’s vision still
remains blocked; a clear and concise explanation is

‘ elusive.

Not being able to stomach self—criticism, scapegoating is
the’ best alternative.

Misdirected anger produces many ogres. As a key villain
responsible for hard times,Japan has had to bear the brunt
of many attacks. For all its apparent economic might, its
public-relations work in the United States is ‘lacking;

When George Bush visited Asian-rim countries last
month, he promised “free access” to thejapanese markets.
For many years now, the United States has maintained a
trade deficit with the Japanese. In 1981 the overall U.S.
trade deficit was $22. 3 billion; this number has now
increased to $101.7 billion.

Strangely enough, this is commonly seen as the fault of
the Japanese. Of course, Americans purchase Japanese
andother foreign products. '

Foreign products sell, and certain barriers exist for U.S.
companies enteringJapanese markets. After Bush’s Asian
tour, hostilities were fueled by comments from members
ofJapan’s parliament decrying the “lazy” American worker.

In response, some angry Americans demand, “Buy

VAmerican.” If the Japanese won’t buy American, then

Americans won’t buy Japanese, proponents argue. But
this. is problematic.

In our world, companies are not bound to single
nations. Multinational corporations assemble products in
two, three or even more countries. Buying American is
not a simple alternative to rescue the U.S. economy. '

Business initiatives in the United States are facing an
unfriendly climate —— some would even describe the
situation as protectionist. Recently, the Japanese-based
company Nintendo was scoffed at in its attempt to
purchase a major league baseball team, the Seattle
Mariners.

Smart business practices by Japanese companies are
condemned. However when American companies show
the savvy to make a profit, Americans seem pleased even
if the average American is not in on the deal —— as long
as it is not the Japanese making a buck. ' ll
« We understand the frustrations expressed by Americans.
Joblessness is increasing; college graduates claw each

’ other’s eyes out for entry-level positions at hotels. A mile-

high debt piles high on the heads of all Americans. But
isolationism is not a viable solution. Japan maintains a

trade surplus with many nations. Some of these, like

Germany, are perceived as economic dynamos.
Entry to markets may facilitate a desirable economic

‘ effect but cannot be viewed as the solution for a stagnant

U.S. economy. Scapegoating theJapanese, public schools

‘ or affirmative-action programs only masks a real crisis in

America.

Boycott sexist advertisers now

I’ve almost a cheer for Megan
Bertino for her editorial on the
Swedish bikini team and Stroh’s
apparent lack of respect for
women. Although there .were
some flaws in Megan’s reasoning,
she did have the right spirit. The
only real thing that I object to
about her editorial is that it has no
solution. Stroh appears to have
all women under its thumb. It is of
no consequence that the women
in the suit had a supervisor that
referred to himself as the “mayor
of pussyville.” Stroh can do what
it likes because women will still
buy Stroh’s as well as Old
Milwaukee, still attend parities
where they are served and still
associate with people who drink
them. I '

I personally would refuse to
associate with anyone that bought
products from a company that
condoned an employee calling
themselves “the mayor of
niggerville.”...And while I would
suggest that any woman who
wants to be taken seriously avoid
Stroh’s products and their
customers, I understand that there.
is a lot of pressure. It's gonna be
your choice, though — will you
be on the road to equality, or will
you be a shining, happy peasant
of “pussyville. ”

No special rights

OK, let’s get this straight.
Brackenridge Hall falls under the
category of “campus housing.”
That means that it’s a dormitory
that houses students on campus,
right? I don’t think anybody has a
problem with that definition.

in order to live on campus, each
student must undergo a very
methodical process known as the
lottery. Everybody who wants
“campus housing” must go and
select numbers from a huge box.
Then numbers are placed into
two categories: valid and invalid
(a.k.a. screwed and not screwed).
People with valid numbers may
select campus housing by order
of seniority. (Seniors pick before
sophomores.) People with invalid

P Letters

numbers live at home or in the
shacks just south of campus.
Again, this all seems pretty clear.

However Greeks moving into
Brackenridge put a slight kink in
this grand scheme. The fraternities
are going to be allotted certain
floors and may place anybody
they want on those floors
(regardless of their lottery
number). How fair does this seem?
If they want to live on campus,
they should have to get into line
with the'rest of us and bid for

suites. If they want a suite for their =

fraternity, get six Greek guys

together with valid numbers...
Bottom line: The Greeks should

not get preferential. treatment.

Why should they sit out the lottery ‘

while the rest of us wait on pins
and needles to see if we will
actually be fortunate enough to
receive campus housing?

Everyone's a critic‘

I just wanted write and
congratulate the authors and
editors of The Pitt News’
Showcase article “Gutting the
Gutless: a realist look at upcoming
films. ” At last I have found a place
where actors are not loved for
their popularity, ﬁlms are not
praised because they are box-
office hits and opinions are not
accepted based on their
conformance to the norm.

I am awed at the brilliant literary
strategy showed in this piece.
I-low original to say that Danny
DeVito’s Hoffa “never looked
worse,” when the authors haven’t
even seen the film! This opens up
a whole new approach to artistic
criticism. We can now berate
books we haven’t read, trash
songs we’ve never listened to and
discount art we haven’t seen!

, I am disappointed, however,

’ for

with the authors’ failure to give
the producer of Poison Izzy credit

, for his originality in giving Drew

Barrymore’s character a “pension
for destruction.” What a
revolutionary concept! In creating
a character who receives a salary
being destructive, a
Hollywood producer proves
himself to be among the avant-
garde... O 1

I would continue my praise of
this magniﬁcent article‘, butl think
I should go finish reading it. I was
so taken in by the critical approach
used by the authors that I decided
to try it myself.

Bloomsburg held a seemingly invincible
20-9 lead over the Panther wrestling team
entering the final two bouts of their Eastern
Wrestling League match. Pitt’s fate was
obvious. It could survive only with two pins.

“It’s the first time we really needed two pins
to win,” Jeff Kloiber said. “The coaches came
to me and told me, ‘You just gotta take it one

point at a time, but if you have the chance’

you have to pin him because we need the
points.’ Andl went outand did exactly that
 I knew if I pinned him, Perry was going to
do it.”

The one-two punch of Kloiber (190 pounds)
and heavyweight Perry Miller made a prophet
out of Pitt head coach Rande Stottlemyer, as
Pitt prevailed, 21-20, Saturday at Fitzgerald
Field House.

Stottlemyer predicted the outcome would

hinge on the last two bouts but said he didn’t
expect to be down by 11 points going in.
“It would have been nice if we had been a

little closer,” Stottlemyer said. “It was a fun .

win because so many things could have gone
so many different ways.” ’
Bloomsburg took it to the 25th-ranked
Panthers early, with first-year man Pete Rinella
scoring an 18-3 technical fall over Dave
Connors. The 126—pound bout became an
intense battle, with Bloomsburg’s Tim Casey
outlasting Bobby Simpson, 7-3. First-year
wrestler]. J. Fasnacht looked to get Pitt on the
board at 134, but Brad Rozanski earned a

hard-fought, 5-2 decision. Pitt trailed 11-0,‘

but the Panthers showed no signs of panic.
Junior Steve Budman (142) locked up with
Steve Lilley in what was expected to be a
close matchup. Budman’s riding-time
advantage proved to be a huge factor. The
bout ended in a 6-6 draw.
Pitt trailed 13-2 heading into the 150-

  

pound bout. The Huskies had one of their
top wrestlers, sophomore Andy Fitzpatrick
(16-2), against Pitt’s Joe Plouse, who has

been on the rise lately. But Fitzpatrick",

hammered out a major, 13-5 decision, putting

Pitt in a huge, 17-2 hole. However the Panthers’ ‘

big guns waited in the wings.

All—American Scott Hovan (158) fired outi_ 

quickly with two takedowns in the opening
moments and. led Brian Willoughby 10-7'
after one. Hovan added another takedown
for a 12-8 lead after the second period. He

steadily built the lead throughout the ﬁnal 

period, with an early takedown making it 14'-
9. Two back points in the closingseconds.
and a big advantage in riding time gave
Hovan a 19-10 major decision and gave Pitt
the boost it needed.

11aa’y Panthers succumb to Proz/ience attack

The Pitt Lady Panthers’ Search for their
elusive eighth win continues after a 91-83
loss to the Providence Lady Friars.

The Lady Panthers (7-12, 3-7) stayed
with the high-scoring Lady Friars (14—5, 7-
3) the entire game, leading for most of the
first seven minutes. Then nationally
renowned Providence forward Tracy Lis
began to" show why she is among the
nation’s leaders in scoring. She scored
just four points in the first six minutes, but
she finished leading all scorers with 34.

Lis hit a layup to give the Lady Friars the
lead at 15-13 with 13:18 left in the first
half. Lady Friar guard Sonya Lewis then
made a layup to give Providence its
largest lead — four points — since early
in the game. The Lady Panthers responded
with jumpers from McElhinny and Jill
Colabrese to tie the contest at 18 with

11:42 before the break.

Lis made two more free throws to
retake the lead before sophomore Jonna
Huemrich canned a hanging jumper for

the last tie of the game at 20.

At that point the Lady Friars used their
press to create turnovers and convert
them into points, going on a 16—2I,run,
which gave them their largest lead of the

Men’s swimming dusts Ohio University, 137-104  

By Jim Lakely
Staf/‘IVr1'ter 9‘

The Pitt men’s swim team once

again outclassed its opponent.

Last Saturday’s victim was Ohio
University by a score of 137-104
in the final dual meet of the
season.

Panther head coach Chuck
Knoles said he was a little nervous
going into the meet because of
how well Ohio University swam
against Bowling Green the week
before, but apparently this
concern was unnecessary,

Ohio and Bowling Green are
hot intrastate rivals and the
Bobcats’ times were fast due
mostly to the intense emotions of

the swimmers. Any worries that I

Knoles had were not shared by
the swimmers.

“Ohio University has some
good swimmers. They’re no
pushovers,” senior Fred
Constantini said. “But we knew
we would be in good shape to
perform well, and we did.”

game at 36-22 with just under 7:29 to go.

Pitt began to whittle away at the lead,
cutting it down to two points on a bucket
by Huemrich at 2:17 before the half. Lewis
scored six points in the last two minutes,
however, helping Providence to a 46-42 .   

advantage.

The meet was mathematically
over after the eighth event as the
Panther swimmers won seven of
the first eight, sweeping three of
them.

The 200—yard medley relay team
of Matt Brady, Don Boyd, Eric
Cornell and Matt Porter began
the rout with a time of 1:36.70.
Two events later, Brady and
Cornell took first and second in
the 200—yard freestyle while team
captain David Schepner captured
third.

Because the Big East
Championship selections are
being made this week, many Pitt
swimmers swam in secondary
events when the meet was in
hand to show the coaches their
versatility and depth with the
margin of victory serving as the
measure.

“When I send these scores out,
I want everyone to know how
deep and how strong we are
because we haven't gotten a lot
of respect yet and we deserve it,”
Knoles said. “It is not our intention

The two teams opened the second half
by trading baskets before Stephanie Cole
hit two free throws to extend the lead to
six. A layup and a free throw by McElhinny
cut it back to three before Huemrich
added a jumper of her own to cut the lead
down to one. That was as close as the Lady
Panthers could come, however, as the
Lady Friars pulled away each time.

The big difference in the game was at
the foul line. Providence attempted 42
foul shots, making 31. Pitt, on the other
hand, shot only 17 free throws, connecting
on 10 of its attempts. This discrepancy
showed up in the fouls category as well.
The Lady Panthers committed 29 team
fouls, with McElhinny and I-luemrich
fouling out and four other players acquiring
four fouls. Providence was whistled only
15 times, and only center Lucie Fontanella
picked up her fourth foul.

“We just didn’t take it to them enough,”
Pitt head coach Kirk Bruce said. “We tried
to get them to foul us down low, and we

\\\\~

to run the score up; it is our
intention to swim our guys in the
eventsthey need to swim to get
them ready for the championship
meet.”

Brady literally played with the
Ohio swimmers in the 500-yard
freestyle. Knoles instructed him
to slow his pace down for the first
250 yards or so and then slowly
pull away for the victory. It was
not until the 400-yard mark that
Brady began to make his move.

-"T he way he swam away, it
looked like they just stopped,"
Knoles said.

David Dodson, who has been
battling a rotator-cuff injury,
encouraged the coaches with his
victory in the 50 freestyle even
though he was only swimming at
about 75 percent.

“David Dodson looks fantastic,”
Knoles said. “He looked better
against Ohio University than he
has all season in the dual meets.”

Last Saturday’s Pitt-Ohio U.
swim meet was a confrontation
between teams looking for
different results. While the
Panthers looked to get solid
performances from its injury-

Bobcats were looking for a dual-

the meet, both teams got what
they wanted: Ohio — result, Pitt

freestyle.

With nearly every swimmer
falling victim to some kind of
illness or injury, the 1991—’92
Panthers have spent more time
resembling patients in a M.A.S.H.
unit than the defending Big East
champions. While the injury cloud
has hovered over Trees Pool for
most of the season —— affecting
the outcome of nearly every meet
this year —-— Pitt continues to
battle the storm, displaying the
fighting spirit of a defending
champion.

The Panthers battled capably
despite a team lineup whose
numbers are getting dangerously
closerto single digits. Seniors Crit
Gallagher and Laura—l.ee Sullivan
each seized victories in the last
home dual meet of their careers.
Gallagher won the 100 freestyle
and took second place in the 50
freestyle. Sullivan grabbed a
victory in the 100 breaststroke.

Sullivan returned to action

following a bout with bronchitis.
While she has yet to regain her
“wind” or endurance, the Panther
captain was encouraged by her
efforts. “I'm finally starting to feel
better,” Sullivan said. “My
breathing is getting better.”

The Rochester, N.Y., native
followed her 100 win with an
uncharacteristic fifth-place finish
in the 200 breaststroke, a finish
she both anticipated and planned.
“I wasn't going after it [in the 200].
I wasn’t worried about winning,”
Sullivan said. “I just wanted to
swim a solid eight laps.”

Gallagher and Sullivan, along
with Noelle Barry, Mindy Hennon
and Janine Atiyeh, all witnessed
their final home dual meet, which
included a special presentation
in their honor beforehand.
“Witnessed” was the operative
word, asAtiyeh and Barry missed
the meet due to illness.

Head coach David Belowich
said he had mixed feelings about

THE Pl'IT NEWS, Monday, February 3, 1992

not letting his seniors participate
in the final meet of their careers.
‘‘I don’t like to have seniors not
able to participate in their last
home meet,” Belowich said, “but
I had to make a call, and health is
more important.”

Now for the positives. The Pitt
divers performed capably, led by
first-year athletes Kara Sixbury
and Anne Marie Rose. Sixbury
won both the 1- and '5-meter
events, while Rose took second
place in both events.Sixbury said
that while her efforts were season
bests, there is room for
improvement. ‘‘I’m not quite
there, yet,” Sixbury said.
“Hopefully, l’ll peak for [NCAA]
prequals and Big Easts
lchampionshipl.”

Sixbury deflects the credit for
her success to teammates and
coaches. “Anne Marie and I are
close [in scoring] every meet, so

‘we push each other in that

respect,” Sixbury said. “And

Despite the loss, which
dropped the Panthers’ final dual-
meet record to 5-5, Belowich was
nothing short of ecstatic about
his team’s year-long performance
through adversity. “I’m very proud
of them,” Belowich said. “Our
team is swimming for and with
each other, and that’s exactly
what we’re trying to accomplish."

Belowich raved about a number
of swimmers who overcame
illness or injury to contribute to
the team effort. ‘‘I’m happy about
efforts like Margaret McClurg’s,”
Belowich said of the sophomore
freestyler. “She’s had some knee.
problems, but every single day
she's in working hard and never
complaining.”

The Pitt head coach continued
his praise of the team’s wading
wounded. “Those that are sick —
they’re getting up and going the
best they can,” Belowich said.

Pitt received outstanding
performances from several
players. Erin Maloy seemed to
find the three—point shot that she
had earlier this season and made
7 of 11 shots from trey land to
lead her team with 23 points.
Huemrich ﬁnished close behind,
tossing in 22 points and grabbing
nine boards before fouling out
with 35 seconds left.

If both the landlord and tenants are “straight” with

consistently upheld their provisions of the lease,
hopefully because we’ve been so fair, considerate

hot, but the first period against
Brian Unkert saw neither man
gain any advantage until Gibbs’
late takedown put him up 2-1.
The bout stood deadlocked at 2-
2 entering the third period. Gibbs
won a 5-3 decision, and Pitt saw
new life, trailing 17-9. .

Stottlemyer had reasons for
concern at 177. First—year wrestler
Sean Kennedy went up against
Huskie seniorMattKreider (14-2-
1), and the Panthers could not
afford to give up more than three
points in this match. Kennedy
wrestled very hard, hanging
within striking distance the
duration of the match, but fell 8-
/I. This set the stage for Pitt’s
unlikely finish.

Kloiber went 14-11 in his first
season at Pitt and carried a record
of 7-6-2 into Saturday, but he
does not get many pins. Both
Kloiber and the coaching staff
knew he would probably win the
match, but Kloiber needed the
pin.

Kloiber pounced on Matt Fisher
from the opening whistle, gaining
complete control. He picked
Fisher up and slammed him to
the mat. An instant later, it was
Over. Kloiber’s pin came just :55
into the bout. Kloiber described
the win as “exhilarating” and said
the Panthers felt extremely

“I knev. once [the referee] called
the fall it was over because Perry
was gonna go out and get the job
done,” Kloiber said.

What looked to be a long shot
seconds earlier appeared to be
all but a certainty with Miller
ready to throttle fIrst—year wrestler
Aaron Pavlechko. It was a familiar
situation for Miller, who has
grown accustomed to deciding
the outcome for Pitt.

“Actually, when it doesn’t come
down to me, it’s a little hard to get
motivated,” he said.

Miller wasted no time with a
quick takedown and 2-0 lead. He
then had Pavlechko in a cradle,
scoring three back points for a 5-
0 lead. The score was irrelevant
as Miller went to work on his
ninth pin of the season. The end
came with :11 remaining in the
period. The fall sent the crowd
into a frenzy, while the Panthers
lifted the All-American on their
shoulders.

“It was great, especially when
the guys picked me up at the end.
They never did that before,” Miller
said.

Miller is now 16-1 on the season.
His only loss came at the Midlands
Tournament. He is ranked fifth in
the nation at heavyweight.
Hovan’s victory boosted his
record to 17-3, and he is currently
ranked sixth in the nation at 158.
Gibbs continued to impress,
moving his mark to 16-6. The
Panthers are now 5-4 on the‘
dual-meet season, 2-2 in EWL. A

been a great performer for so

i many years. He has become a

tremendous leader on the diving
team, bringing along the younger
divers.”

‘‘It is strange to think that this is
the last time we would swim one-
on-one against a team,”
Constantini said. “It didn’t really
hit many of us until after we left
the meet.”

Senior Matt Porter made his
last meet a memorable one.
Despite an ongoing battle with a
chronic shoulder inju ry, he swam
the best dual-meet SO freestyle of
his career at 22.00. Other seniors
who ended the dual-meet season
with strong finishes were Eric
Mattson, who won the 400
individual medley C/I:08.91); Joe
Kozlina, who won the 100 fly
(52.26); and Cruz, who won the
5~meter board.

Pitt has reached the point in
the season that Knoles said he
dreads. The Big East
Championships are in three
weeks, and he must narrow his
26—man roster to 18 members.
With the depth ofthis team, there
are inevitably some talented
swimmers left out of the season’s
premier meet.

“We have to make a statement
about where we are going as a
team," said Knoles."The guys have
worked so hard to compete at
top, Division I level,” he said. “It
would be a mistake to lose sight
of those lofty goals to appease
everybody. It is going to be a very
difficult decision.”

Kuntu Theater presents Clean Drums

Jason llillman/l'h(: Pitt News

By Matt Goldstein
S!aﬂ"W’r1'ter

Of the memories Vernell Lillie
has of her childhood, her fondest
are of picking berries with her
grandmother in the wide-open
spaces of 'l'e.\'as along the Bra’/.os
River.

ller second is probably the. day
she and a few friends were
walking home from a town
bazaar, stopped by her Catholic
school and found :1 group of
children rehearsing for the school
play.

“The drama coach welcomed
us into the theater, and I haven’t
been away from it since,” Lillie
said from be.hind her desk at her
office in Forbes Quadrangle. “It
was April 7, the same day my first
child was born.”

Lillie has been teaching in Pitt’s
black studies department since
1972. She is also the founder and
director of the Kuntu Repertory
Theater, dedicated to producing
plays which portray the African-
American experience.

Lillie earned her bachelor’s
degree from Dillard University in
New Orleans in drama and speech
correction. She then headed north
to Carnegie Mellon University,
where she earned master’s and
doctoral degrees in linglish.

She first became familiar with
Pitt’s black studies department
about 20 years ago through the
experiences ofher daughter who
attended Taylor Allderdice High
School in Squirrel Hill. After
several racial conflicts at the
school, Lillie’s daughter formed a
group supported by the black
studies department to help ease
tensions at the school.

Shortly thereafter Lillie heard
the department was looking for
someone to assist l)lack
youngsters, train teachers and
organize cultural events. She
applied and landed the job.

But it was in 1974, when Lillie
combined both her loves —
theater and reaching out to the
black community —~ that Kuntu
was formed.

Today 75 percent of Kuntu’s
members are Pittsburgh college
students, although the group is
open to any member of the
Pittsburgh community.

But Kuntu wasn’t the first black
theater company in Pittsburgh,
according to Lillie. The Irene
Kaufman League was an
interracial group that lasted about
seven years. The Black Horizons
Theater association, was formed
by two of Lillie’s good friends,
Rob Penny and August Wilson.
Penny is currently Kuntu’s writer
in residence and has worked with

Bright head scarves, African
earrings and dresses embroidered
with gold and silver threads
are just a few examples of
Afrocentric clothing worn to

express pride in the black-

culture.

“The African garb is only one
outward manifestation of a whole
cultural awareness that is going
on all over the world. Essentially
what you see on college
campuses and in the community
is a new cultural revolution:
African-Americans celebrating
their culture,” said Clifford Sykes,
a University of Pittsburgh
ethnomusicology graduate
student and member of the Black
Action Society.

Typical African-American

articles of clothing include the .

dashiki, an overblouse that comes
down below the waist, and the

Afrocentric dress reﬂects black pride

status.

A Buba is a long, embroidered
dress worn by a woman, and the
Kente cloth is a handwoven,
cotton cloth which is worn on the
head with straps that hang down
onto the shoulders.

“The colors ofAfrican dress are
incredible. You can’t imagine how
vibrant and beautiful they really
are,” Sykes said.

“I think the reason many wear
it is because of the pride they
have in identifying with the
African-American style. The
different styles and designs make
people feel proud. It makes
them feel closer to their
culture and heritage and makes
them feel closer to the
community,” said Black Action
Society President Marta

American garb. They are
reintroducing themselves to
traditional African culture, and
the dress is just one aspect,”
Sykes said.

Expressing pride in their roots
has often been a struggle for
African-Americans.

“In order to understand
anything, you must understand
the root of it,” Malcolm x said,
which is the key to understanding
Afrocentrism, according to
Sykes.

“African people did not come
to this country by choice. No
matter how you cut it, you have
to understand that African-
Americans are realizing the
significance of our being here.

. Due to the enslavement when

Africans were brought over, we've
had no choice about our culture.
The culture we’ve grown up with
has been forced on us,” Sykes
said. A

Victor Chaney works at Wood
Street Emporium, which
specializes in African-American
garb. ‘

“It’s important we keep some
of our heritage,” Chaney said.
“It’s uplifting to the self—esteem.
The clothing makes a statement
of who you are and your
identity.”

The people of Pittsburgh,
especially the younger
generation, are becoming more
conscious of their heritage,
according to Chaney. .

“I think it’s important for black
people to be aware of their culture

and consciousness. I wear la. .
- colorful head scarf] as a symbol

of my pride in my culture,” Pitt
student Michelle Lambert
said.

“It’s ‘very significant to me. I
will always probably wear African
garb the rest of my life," Sykes
said ,

“As a school teacher, I would
always wear African-American
garb. I thought it was
important for my students to see

that as long as you’re neat and.

clean, you can be respected for
who you are. America has come

— a long way in that sense but

certainly hasa long way to go,”
he said.

By Suzann Gries
Staﬂ‘ Writer

The Malcolm X Holiday
Commission is trying to legitimize
the celebration without the
endorsement of the US.
government, according to
commission chair Lee Kiburi.

But the process of instituting
this holiday also requires African-
Americans to change the way
they think about themselves,
Kiburi said.

“They think that you need the
government to sanction {Malcolm
X Day], or that if it is not endorsed
by society, then it is not
legitimate,” Kiburi said.

Malcolm X was a severe critic
of American society, according
to Kiburi.

“Malcolm. spoke more
specifically to black people. He
enraged whites inmany respects,
prior to this last year,” Kiburi
said.

The government has portrayed
Malcolm X as a violent man in

contrast to Martin Luther KingJr.,

    

whose image is that of a man of
peace. “Malcolm X was not
endorsed and sanctioned by the
government as Dr. King was,” he
said. '

The commission is working in
conjunction with the National
Malcolm X Commemoration
Commission. The honorary chair
of the NMXCC is Malcolm’s widow
Betty Shabazz.

The NMXCC sponsored the First
Annual Malcolm X Day on May
19, 1990, in Omaha, Neb.

The NMXCC and the MXHC
called on African—Americans to
refrain from drugs, alcohol and
nicotine as part of the celebration.
Kiburi said abstaining from
drugs on this day recognizes
Malcolm’s triumph over
drugs.

Kiburi said he first became
interested in researching Malcolm
X when he was ,a student at
Schenley High School.

“Malcolm advocated self-
defense, which was something I
could relate to. I understood he
said we weren’t to be the

he said.

Although Kiburi supports the
Afrocentric movement, he said
that some Afrocentrists do not
deal with the problems of most
African-Americans.

“One of the important
problems that I see is that,
although I support Afrocentricity,
it must look at the inequities that
exist within the larger society,"

Jason llillman/fhe Pitt News
Vcrnell Lillie, founder and director of the Kuntu Repertory
Theater.
Continued from page B-1
Lillie since Kuntu’s inception almost 18 years ago.

Penny said Lillie has been a tremendous help to the black
community at Pitt and throughout Pittsburgh by producing
excellent productions which have “brought the African—American
experience alive on the stage. She’s like the mother of African-
/\merican theater in Pittsburgh  [I.illie| is one of the best
directors l’ve ever worked with.”

"l'rn simply interested in working with plays that deal honestly
with the human experience. lispecially the black experience,”
Lillie said.

Kuntu performed one of Penny's works, Forum in liligbl, a
collage of poetry, plays and dance, at the lidinburgh Fringe
l"estival in lidinburgh, Scotland in 198‘). But just as exciting to
Lillie as the trip itself was seeing the group come together and
raise the .‘S3(),()()() needed to go.

The community working together is a prime aspect of black
drama and (f.S[)C('.Tl2llly Kuntu’s plays. “The community becomes
the most important thing. There isn't a single protagonist,” Lillie
said.

She referred to August Wilson’s Ma /(ai'ney's lilac/e Bottom, a
play she directed for Kuntu before it went to Broadway. The
play was then called //omecoming.

“\‘(/ilson’s plays are excellent examples of this. [The play] is
about Ma Rainey’s battle with the music industry and the new
upcoming jazz musicians who treated black performers and
other musicians derogatively. Ma Rainey appears to be the sole
protagonist, but she’s not. She doesn’t even come in until
halfway through the play.” Lillie said. '

The church scenes are examples of the call and response
technique that brings a community together. “Some might see
that as just noise," Lillie said, “but it's showing the community
functioning as one."

i\/larta liffinger, president. of the Black Action Society, has
worked with Lillie on many Kuntu productions and received
guidance for her own play, (»'m'ort .S'tazz'(>rz, which Kuntu
perforined last ()ctober. “She's brought black theater to the
forefront in Pittsburgh and is completely dedicated to the Kuntu
theater," liffinger said.

August Wilson isn’t the only famous alumnus of Kuntu. Other
notable people who have been associated with the company
include the actor Monte Russell and the late author Kathleen
Collins. l-Esther Rolle starred in the 23th anniversary production
of Lorraine llansberry’s .-1 lt’ai'si'rz in the Sim, which Lillie
directed.

.\‘ow Lillie is preparing for Kuntu's 20th anniversary, which is
coming soon ‘‘I‘m beginning to look forward to my retirement.
I’d like to know that ll\'untul is permanent and not have the need
to start all over again," she said.

Lillie said she hopes to see the theater expand into a graduate
theater program in black studies and eventually an .»\ctor's
liquity theater.

With all her success Lillie hasn’t forgotten her friends back in
Texas. “i go in and out. Theater is alive and well in Houston,
which has four black theater companies, and to see them work
together and learn is a marxelous thing,” she said.

“The conflict is there’s these old

the so-called avant garde, this free-

Psychologist stomis minority women ’s support group 

By Rebecca Wilkins
Sta_[7‘ Writer

problems, Ballantyne said.
“There is something to be said

for struggling with a group of

According to group leader
Jillian Ballantyne, the Minority
\X/omen’s Support Group at Pitt
came out of her own experience
as a minority graduate student at
the University of Buffalo.

“It’s the kind ofexperience that
can at times undermine your self-
confidence,” said Ballantyne, who
is also a clinical psychologist and
the coordinator of minority
student services at the university
counseling center. “I made the
decision even back then that
wherever I went, I would do a
group like this for women like
me. -
The group was founded for

people who are where you are
and who know what you are
talking about,” she said.

The group, which meets once
a week for an hour and a half,
was founded last fall.

“The flyer says, ‘Learn about
each other’s experiences,
establish goals for personal
growth, share thoughts and
feelings,’ and that’s really what I
try to do,” Ballantyne said.

One of the goals of the group
is to keep minority students in
school, despite problems they
may be facing.

“I think it’s a place where people
can confirm that they are sane

77

and get the kind of support that
they need to keep going,” said
Ballantyne, noting that support
groups are still needed even
though more women and
minorities are going to graduate
school now. “The other thing I
would want to do in a group like
this is take it even further and
have it be a place where people
can explore more issues of depth,
in terms of their own personal
development,” she said.

Ideally, Ballantyne would like
to have eight to 10 women in the

group, from a variety ofdifferent
departments, professional schools
and racial backgrounds.

‘‘I’m interested in helping
people stay lin school], and there
are other programs that I do, not
just for minorities, that are
designed to help people figure
out ways to continue to be
students,” she said, citing the
five-week personal achievement
workshop. “It’s a way to help
people look at ways in which
they have the potential to succeed,
but where they tend to undermine

their success,” she said.
Ballantyne is developing a
special two-hour personal
achievement group as a part of
Black History Month. '
“One ofthe things we’re going
to look at is yes, there are external
forces that do prevent minority
students from achieving,” she said,
adding that there are also internal
forces that can prevent
achievements. “When we start
losing our confidence in ..our
ability to succeed, then we don’t

Singer to perform

revue of jazz greats

By Heather York
For The Pitt News

She’s spent years on Broadway,
performing in /)reamgz’rls, /l1'n’t
Mz'5bebam'n’and other favorite shows.

She's appeared on “Murphy Brown,”
“A [Different World” and “The Fresh
Prince of Bel Air.”

' And now Jenifer Lewis is coming to
Pitt.

V livery February Lewis takes a break
from her busyi;\'ew York and I lollywood
schedule to embark on a college tour,

performing her one-woman show “From

Billie to Lena with Jenifer.” 'I'he show

traces black history through the eyes of

black female vocalists, beginning with
Billie Holliday.

Pitt Program Council is bringing the
show to Pitt on Wednesday, Feb. 5.
in “lsaw her tape and knew she’d be
great to see live,” said Julie Veil, arts
committee director for PPC. “And it
correlates with Black History Month.”

Veil said the show will appeal to a
wide audience. Lewis sings the blues,
dances and acts in her show. “You can’t
put her in any category,” Veil said. “I just
call her an entertainer."

Lewis is from St. I.ouis and has been
in show business for many years. She’s
been in several Broadway musicals,

and her one-woman show, On The
Couch, was a critical success.

She’s also toured Europe, starring in
Harlem Story with Bette Midler, who
has been quoted as saying Lewis is “the
greatest black performer I've ever seen,
and I’m the greatest white one.”

Lewis has a recurring role on “Murphy
Brown,” and has appeared on many
other sitcoms. -She is currently working
on an Home Box Office special.

Ix,-wis and a collaborator wrote “From
Billie to Lena with Jenifer” five years
ago, and Lewis has taken the show to
colleges ever since.

“Jenifer calls it her own celebration of
Black History Month,” saidJay Callahan
of Keppler Associates, which organized
the tour. “She’s one of the most exciting
performers you will ever see.”

The show is Lewis’ personal tribute to
seven of the most famous black female
entertainers in history, Callahan said.
’l'he tour begins on 'I'uesday at Rhode
Island University. She’ll be in the William
Pitt Union Assembly Room on Wednes-
day night at 8:30. Tickets are $2 for
students and $10 for non—students.

“You will definitely get more than
your money’s worth,” Callahan said.
“And one day very soon, when Jenifer
Lewis is an even bigger star, you can say
you saw her.”

BAS brings famous authors,
activists to motivate students

By Catherine Goldstein
Staff Writer

The Black Action Society is sponsoring
a series ofevents for Black History Month,
which will begin with a lecture by Kwame
T ou re, author of Blacle Power.

Toure will be speaking on Pan-
Africanism in the student activist
movement, and his speech will be followed
by a poetry reading and a dance recital.
The speech will be held in the William Pitt
Union Assembly Room on Feb. 4 at 8:50
p.m.

The BAS tries to choose speakers who
can offer something to everyone,
according to T iwanda Taylor, program
chairperson of the BAS.

“A large percent of the audienceis from -

the Pittsburgh area and from other colleges.

Of course we would like to see as many-

people from Pittas possible,” she said.
“Our goal is to get students motivated in

lines academically, educationally,‘

culturally and politically.”

Dr. Frances Wellsing, psychiatrist and

clinical director» of the Mental Health
Center in Washington D.C., is a the author
of several books, such as Isis Papers. She

Taylor was particularly moved by a
quote in one of his articles: “There’s a
Martin Luther King in each of us.”

“All we need to do is put ourselves to
work, and we’ll change not only ourselves
but society for the better. These people
are coming here to teach us or reaffirm
our beliefs,” Taylor said.

The lectures will be followed by a
question and answer period.

“This is probably my favorite. part,
because they come to life, especially the
people you’ve always respected and
wanted to meet. It's not_ just for Afro-

" Americans. lt’s beneficial for everyone to .

learn about different cultures,” Taylor

. said.

Films sponsored by the Pitt Program
Council include Death of a Propberwith a
discussion on who killed Malcolm X, Boyz
in tbe Hood and several videos.

The last day of Black History Month will ‘

be a Black Active Students Intercollegiate
Struggle workshop. The theme is

'”F.mpowerment through Unity —— a

necessity for survival.”

BASICS chair Ricardo Washington said
its objective is to “get a strategy for unifying
the Afro-American community on different
college campuses in keeping of the goals
of our committee.”

Along with these events will be plays

younger musicians will improvise in their

Bebop was originated by jazz greats like
Charlie “Bird” Parker, Dizzy Gillespie and
many others, including local drummer
Kenny Clark, who died recently. l-larris
said bebop has more form, structure and
melody and it can move into a class like
liuropean chamber music.

“But bebop’s not just intellectual,” Penny
said, “ll-larrisl likes music that swings,
music that people can dance too. Now
free form can be that too, but in the play,
the kids don’t want to learn classical black
jazz. They just want to do what their
contemporaries are doing, and to me that
seems like commercialism.”

l-larris added, “Before you can add to,
you haveto know what exists. Learn from
the past to see how to improve.”

Penny said free form music can be good
as |)el)op, but it’s important for kids to
know how to learn and how to practice.
He said Wynton Marsalis and Harry
(jonnick Jr, create good original jazz but
also can play classical or big band.

Penny said llarris set an example in his
day because he could read music, unlike
stereotypical drummers. “Isle could play in
white bands, like polka bands, just as well
as anyone else,” he said.

llarris started playing jazz. in the '40s
with Gillespie and “liird” Parker and later
played for symphony orchestras in liurope,
Asia and /\I'ric:i.“l Iarris is a very intense,
emotional, creative and intelligent person

with lots of stories to tell,” said Penny.
The play features innovative
combinations ofmusic and dialogue. Each
musical instrument is paired with a
woman’s voice. During solos the music
stops and the women start speaking and
singing, emulating different vocal styles of
singers like Billie Holiday and Lena Home.
“The voice was the first musical
instrument. So it’s in line with looking to

the past. Throughout the play Joe looks to
the past and meets his younger self as a
child, teenager and young adult,” he said.

Clean Drums is the latest of Penny’s 20-
plus plays. He has been with Pitt since
1969 when he taught poetry in the black
studies department. He served as a
chairperson for that department in 1978.

In 1975 Penny and Pulitzer Prize-winner
August Wilson founded the Kuntu \Vriter’s

Workshop which works in conjunction
with the Kuntu Repertory Theater.

The work Kuntu is a close African
equivalent to aesthetics, or beauty and
order. The word suggests the harmonic

mean between people and their creations. ,

“To me, Kuntu means total theater.
There’s no separation between acting,
singing, and dancing. It’s all part of the
total experience,” Penny s-aid.
