Oakland Rapist.
Claims 8 Victims;
Police Baffled

BY RITA VITOLO

‘ Responding to reports of a lone
rapist in the Oakland-Shadyside
area, police officials advised
Oakland residents to exert extreme
caution until the attacker is
apprehended.

Eight assaults recorded since
September 22, the most recent an
attempted rape in Oakland March
8, have been linked to a talkative
rapist who brags of his virility and
sexual prowess, according to police
in the city's Youth and Sexual
Assaults Section.

The attacks occurred during the
early morning hours, the rapist
gaining entry by forcing open a
window. Most have been
ground-floor apartments, but one
third-floor was entered from a roof.

“You can make your apartment a
fortress, you can plant landmines,
you can dig a moat and fill it with
piranhas and still you're not going
to have any kind of promise that
you're safe," said Oakland's No.
4's Lieutenant Jim Heagy. “Look
out for one another. never go
anywhere alone. You suspect
something, something fishy's go-
ing on, give us a call. Report it."

Heagy had common sense
advice: “Good locks. See who's at

state budget is one of their major
concerns.

“We've run into a lot of problems
trying to get a copy of the school's‘
budget," said Student Government
President Mike Furick. “Univer-
sity officials claim the figures are
strictly confidential. We'd liketo
know where all this money is
going." _

Furick was referring to the $4
million increase appropriated to
Pitt in the new state budget.

"However, neither legislator has

seen the budget as yet, and when
they vote it will be onlyon _a lump
sum for the University.

Public Reaction Divided   

[On Shapp Death—Bi|| Veto

BY LARRY PLATT

An immediate public outcry has
followed Governor Milton Shapp's
Friday night veto of the death
penalty bill. Both the State Senate
and House overwhelmingly passed
the bill -which provided death by
electric chair for persons convicted
of the murder of'a police officer,
kidnap slayings, and the killing of
someone during a felony.

Senator Robert Rovner [R-Phil-
adelphia] said the legislature
“overhwlemingly approves of 'cap-
ital punishment because they feel it

Rep. Moorhead Sees Trans'itNeed f

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

US Congressman William S.
Moorhead, Pittsburgh Democrat

and candidate for re-election in

Pennsylvania's 14th District dis-
cussed .the economic situation

‘facing Pittsburgh and Allegheny

County at the Alumni Association's
Business Symposium, Saturday.

‘ Moorhead, a guest speaker,
outlined. some of the economic
challenges facing large cities
throughout the country, and
decribed federal measures to ease
those. “We need to improve the
legislation in the field of housing,
Lord knows we need housing in this
area.” '

Mass transportation is another
key point to the survival of

sPittsburgh as a community and

livable environment, Moorhead
said. “I don't» think an urban
Community like Pittsburgh

can survive without mass transpor-
tation. We're working on a new

program now, and just as Pitts-,

burgh was ahead of‘ the nation in
urban renewal, I-hope you will get
ahead of the nation in using the

V!

new techniques. 3
“This gathering is focusing on
national and local economy, let's

see the Allegheny County get in

there first with the innovative
programs."
In an interview after his

presentation, Moorhead said the
inﬂationary national economy was
the greatest problem facing the
legislature. He was undecided
about the continuation of price
controls.

“I really haven't made up my
mind on that yet, I think the right
decision would be to give the
President stand-by controls, sub-

v ject to Congressional approval.

This is contrary, however, to the
positions of ‘both labor and
business," Moorhead said.

Price controls are no longer
effective and th_e government
should look elsewhere for methods
of regulation, Moorhead said.

“In peacetime, controls can only

work for a limited period of time,
and the distortions they build into
the economy cause a resentment so
that they cannot work. The
President should be able to call in
both sides of a dispute and say, be
reasonable or I’ll slap controls on
you.” I .

Earned 3.82‘ QPA ‘

Lifer Tappe

BY RALPH HAURWITZ

Tyrone Jackson, 28, has spent 3
years in state prison serving a life
sentence for first degree murder.
Last Friday, officers -from Phi Eta
Sigma, a freshman honorary
fraternity at Pitt, went inside .the
concrete walls and heavy steel
doors of the massive penitentiary
overlooking the Ohio River and
inducted Jackson into their society.
The reason: he has earned a 3.82
grade average in classes taught by
volunteer, Pitt faculty. inside the
institution.

“I’m still really shocked by this _ ‘L

honor,” grinned Jackson, neatly

dressed in white'pants and shirt.

The short ceremony was held in
the visiting room of the State
Correctional Institution at Pitts-
burgh (formerly Western Pennsyl-
vania State Penitentiary). The
large room was crowded with
prisoners, and their wives, and
girlfriends.

Jackson's mother, Mrs. Theo-
dora Hubbard, sat beside him,
smiling and slightly choked with
pride. He _too, admitted to being a

Moorhead claimed the tradi-
tional use of Defense’ Department
sepnding to boost the economy was
faulty, and Defense department
spending should be cut in favor of
more directly effective programs.

“I think Defense Department
spending should be for defense
only. Defense Department spend-
ing should be cut to the extent they
came up for the increase because

Republican gubernatorial can-

have signed the bill if he had been

hand the governor “the rebuke he‘ '

deserves."

penalty bill.

they have the votes to pass it,” said»

to the bill, saying he would signa

possible for murder

duties, or murder committed by

‘Enemies List’

Cites Federal

BY LEE MARKOVITZ

The government spies upon and
harasses left-wing organizations
according to White House , “En-
emies List" member Debby Bustin,
National Chairwoman of the
Socialist Workers Party (SWP)
Campaign Committee.

Speaking to about 65 people here

8 Friday night, Bustin said : “Both

Democrats and Republicans have
been harassing us for the past 35

years. ' The government andfthe ‘

corporations are making war on you
and me and if you fight back you
are called subversive. _

“In 1947 the Attorney General
was given the power to declare any
group as subversive. Once you are
declared ‘subversive, you can’t
appeal, and’the government can’
then justify anything they do to
you," she said.‘ ,

Bustin claimed Cubans who had

_ burned down SWP’s Los'Angeles

headquarters later admitted in
court they were working for the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

“The real subversive group in
this country is the government,”
Bustin said. “They aren’t afraid
that we may be undemocratic or
violent,» they are afraid of our
ideas.” .

A counciling service for under-
graduates interested in takin

deliberately dropped an investiga- -
tion into the possibility financier ,

Robert ,Vesco may have been
involved in a heroin smuggling
ring.

Vesco, wanted in this country for
fraud and allegedly linked to la.rge
secret contributions to,the 1972
Nixon campaign, has avoided
extradition from his present home
in Costa Rica. 2

Bustin also charged the..ener'gy
crisis ‘was manufactured bymthe oil
companies. “We have gone in one
year from the meat crisis, to the

’ milk crisis, to the wheat crisis, to

the energy crisis," she said. “But
through all of these shortages, the
corporations were able to raise
their profits. '

' “I think this whole energy crisis
was organized in the. board rooms
of the oil companies and it will go
down in history as America’s
greatest rip-of .”

Bustin said, she was put on the
“Enemies List" after signing an

that doesn't satisfy any consumer
demands.

“I think Public Service Employ-
ment is much better. When you
hire people to improve parks and
provide better services, each dollar
goes further in creating new jobs,”
Moorhead said.

Concerning nationalization of
critical public services, Moorhead
opposed direct control of the oil
industry, but favored some form of
government watch—dog on petrol-
eum production. '

“I favor less radical action. than
nationalization. The greatest
defect this crisis brought up was
the figures the government had to
go on when deciding whether or not
to have rationing were figures from
the American Petroleum Indus-
tries,” Moorhead said.

“I think we will continue to have
an energy crisis, but I don't
necessarily know the magnitude of
it because It don't necessarily
believe the figures of the petroleum

‘ industries'._

“There is a bill to establish a
federal energy administr/ation,"
Moorhead said, “which empowers
them to get every figure they need.

Moorhead said he would not be
surprised at nationalization of
railroads. but he would support
such a move reluctantly. “I'm not
a socialist," he said, "l-think free
enterprise does better. If you're
going to nationalize any industry, it
should be the railroads. I don't
think the government is a very
good businessman. but certainly
the railroads haven’t been doing

  Pitt Commitments

Because of an apparent misunderstanding concerning the perma-
nent funding of the Arsenal Family and Children’s Center, Pitt’s admin-
istration may deprive the residents of the Lawrenceville community
the services of a successful effort at University-community coopera-
tion.

The administration reports it informed the Center three years ago
it was to seek funding from either federal or the state government for
the Center’s programs. However, representatives from Arsenal Center
contend the Center agreed in 1971 to seek funding wherever it was avail-
able, but that no stipulation was made to obtain state or federal funds.

The Arsenal Center has succeeded in raising approximately $137,-
000, but this is not sufficient for the center to operate. At present the
Center is suffering from a $40,000 debt, which the University refuses to
subsidize.

During this three year period the Center was funded by six founda-
tions, financial aid enlisted by the University. It is apparent then, that
in the past the University has considered the Arsenal Center a social
program worth its attention.

Now after,2l years of service to the community the University will
terminate its relationship with the Arsenal Center.

Nobody can debate the value of the contributions Arsenal Center
has made to the Lawrenceville community. Already concerned citizens
are organizing opposition to the University’s actions because they do
not want to lose such a valuable public service.

However, the Lawrenceville community is not the sole beneficiary
of the Arsenal Day Care Center.

The Center provides practical training for Pitt students who work

A in/ the child care program, and Pitt faculty members use Arsenal as a
. research area. Eight schools and departments in the University are

served by the Arsenal Day Care Center. I

Recently Chancellor Posvar appointed a panel under the direction
of Dr. Robert Glaser of the University’s Learning, Research and Develop-
ment Center to examine early childhood programs within Pitt’s juris-
diction.

The report of the panel advocated the continuance of the Arsenal
program. It is ironic a committee formed by the Chancellor recom-
mended the continuation of the program, yet the University adminis-
tration is willing to make the Arsenal Center a victim of the inflationary
situation‘. 1

The University has a moral responsibility to the residents of Law-
renceville and to the University community tocontinue the operation
of Arsenal Center. ’

Dr. Posvar says the Center had sufficient time to seek other fund-
ing and that the Center was aware of the consequences if it failed. The
Chancellor is apparently willing to sacrifice a child development pro-
-gram because of a time limit. These actions on the part of the Univer-
sity administration reflect an insensitivity to human needs, which
should not exist at a so-called socially conscious institution of higher
learning.

We are compelled to urge the administration to reconsider its re-
fusal to fund Arsenal Center.

Furthermore, we urge our Student Government representatives to
petition the University for the Center’s continued funding.

In addition, we call on the residents of the Lawrenceville commun-
ity to continue their battle against the University’s refusal to meet
the responsibilities inherent in being a part of the local community.

Death Revisited

Gpvernor Milton Shapp showed great courage Friday in vetoing
House Bill 1060 which threatens to reinstate the death penalty in Penn-
sylvania. <

The capital punishment bill would have authorized death by the
electric chair for those persons convicted of one of nine_ specific first
degree murders; such as the killing of a policeman or fireman in the
line of duty, contract murders, or the killing of a kidnap victim.

In his veto message, Shapp said, “As a child I was taught rever-
ence for God and reverence for the commandments of God and. rever-
ence for life which God has bestowed upon us.”

Wewholeheartedly agree with this part of the Governor’s mess-
age. .
We feel uneasy, however, because the Governor put a qualifica-
tion on his important veto by explaining that the legislature could con-
ceivably enact death penalty legislation satisfactory to him.

Shapp said he would sign a bill making the death penalty available
for persons committing such serious moral offenses as: murder dur-
ing the commission of a crime such as kidnapping or the slaying of a
law enforcement officer performing his duty.

Therefore, we again must reiterate that murder, including mur-
der done by jurisdiction of a “legitimate state,” can never be justified.

Speaking in moral terms it is beyond comprehension that murder
under special circumstances might be justifiable whereas it is u'njusti-
fiable under other circumstances.

Furthermore, we are appalled that the legislature has seen fit to
distinguish certain crimes from other crimes as being subject to a’
death penalty. Who is fit to make these judgments?

_ Now the important issue is before us once again. Motions to over-
ride the Governor’s veto are expected to be introduced in both houses
of the State Legislature today.

We strongly urge, as did Governor Shapp last week, that the pub-
lic servants examine their consciences and vote to dissolve the death
penalty legislation. This message is sincerely directed to Oakland
Representative James Romanelli and all other legislators who voted
for the original bill.

Hockey: A Funding Dilemma

BY TOM SMITH

Once again it is the time of the
year when Student Government
begins reviewing budgets of
recognized student organizations
for the ﬁscal year beginning July 1.

Usually the process results in
much controversy and this year is
no exception. The SG Allocations
Committee has recommended the
Hockey Club not be subsidized by
Student Government in the ﬁscal
year ’74-’7S.

The Allocations recommendation
is not an attempt to deny students
at Pitt a source of sports
entertainment. Instead, the
recommendation is aimed at
improving hockey to better serve
the interests of the students.

According to the by-laws of
Student Government all allocation
recommendations must be ap-
proved by the SG Board. The
Board has yet to receive the
recommendation from the com-
mittee, but it will be on the, agenda
for the open Board meeting this
Wednesday. ‘

No decision” on the question of
funding the Hockey Club has been
made and to suggest the opposite is
clearly unfair to the Board and the
Hockey Club. Few people
remember it is the Allocations

. Committee which reveiws budgets
and the SG Board which approves

budgets.

The Allocations Committee has
suggested the Pitt Hockey Club be
funded instead by the Athletic
Department. This is not a new idea
not is it one motivated by a desire
to “unload” the organization.

Until this year the Hockey Club
was the only successful athletic
organization on campus. - Last
Thursday the Pitt Hockey Club, an

organization funded by Student
Government, won the WPIHA
championship for the third consec-
utive year.

In the past the University has
contended it was unable to fund a
varsity hockey program at Pitt
because of the unlimited amount of
funds available to distribute among
already existing varsity sports.

Supposedly‘ Athletic Director
Casmir Myslinski wishes he could
add the costs "of hockey to his
budget. But the Athletic Depart-
ment reportedly is financially
incapable of handling such a task.
_ The Athletic Director may be
right, except nobody knows for
certain. For the past year
Myslinski has refused to release his
budget to Student Government
representatives or to the press
becasue the ﬁgures “might be
misunde.'_i;stood."

Myslinski should
athletic budget. Then everyone on
this campus can judge whether the
University is ﬁnancially incapable
of funding the Hockey Club. Once
this secrecy ends debate concern-
ing the funding of the Hockey Club
could also come to an immediate
conclusiqn. ‘

Mr. Myslinski uses the same
argument as Richard Nixon, when
the President refused to release his
tapes. Once the tapes were
released, the American ‘people

‘learned two crucial tapes were

missing and another was the victim
Obviously,
Nixon had much to hide. What
about Casmir Myslinski and the
administration of the University of
Pittsburgh?

Approximately $300,000 is col-
lected by Student Government
through the Activities Fee. Over

   
  

.:.Arv——

\
release the_

one hundred organizations are
‘eligible to apply for money. For
this fiscal year approximately
one-half of all funds were allocated
for programming by student
groups.

More than likely Athletic Direc-
tor Myslinski has a budget which
far exceeds $300,000. Apparently
it is not the Athletic Department
but Student Government which
suffers from a severe limitation of
funds. ‘

The Athletic Department does
not have to wait until 1978 in order
to gain access to an indoor ice
skating rink. This year the Hockey
Club has skated at Alpine and the
Civic Arena. If SG can fund a club
which utilizes off campus facilities,
the University can do the same.

Hockey is the fastest ‘growing
sport in America today. Obviously,
college hockey has great money
making potential. But a sport can
only be ﬁnancially successful if
money is invested into it. Certainly
the Athletic Department would
agree since this is the strategy
being used to_rebuild the football
program.

The Pitt Hockey Club aims to
expand its schedule and improve
the existing hockey program.
long as the present system of
funding is continued, the Pitt
Hockey Club will never be able to
achieve these goals. Student
Government does not have the
money available to invest in a first
rate hockey operation at Pitt.

Hockey at Pitt will suffer as a
result. A championship team
deserves better treatment than SG
can provide. It is for this reason SG
has attempted in the past to gain
funding from the University for the
club.

Hopefully, Student Government
will petition the Athletic Depart-
ment for funding of a varsity
hockey program. Anyone con-
cerned with the improvement of
hockey at Pitt will agree it is the
responsibility of the Athletic
Department to fund team sports.
In time the University community
will become aware of those who
really are concerned.

Letter to
the Editor

Editor:

It is nice to know that the Pitt
Track team has the ﬂu, but the
headline in the Monday, March 11

. issue should have read, Bill Rea #2

in the nation.

This is only the last of a series of
articles that seem to miss Rea’s
success until the last paragraph
mentions him. For somebody
being All-American four times and
All-East eight times, he seems to
be skipped over when it comes to
sports coverage.

Reading the sports pages -in the
Pitt News, it appears to me that if it
is not football, basketball, or what
came across the AP wire not much
coverage is given.

I don’t know if this lack of
coverage results from your staff of
the public relations people in the
ﬁeld house. No matter who is at
fault, the people of the University
should know that a world-class
jumper attends Pitt.

little nervous, but outwardly his
manner was remarkably cool,
friendly, and controlled.

He is part of an educational
program at the institution which
involves 75 inmates and 45
teachers from Pitt and Alle-
gheny Community College.

.- Courses are taught in English,

speech, black studies, and psy-
chology -- and on different levels:
college, vocational, secondary, and
adult basic education. Pitt has
been involved for three years,
Allegheny for ﬁve.

The program's big thorn is lack
of money. Controversial from the
start, it has never‘ been whole-
heartedly supported by the state or
federal governments, according to
John Chess, assistant Education
Director at the institution.

“Although the Scaife-Mellon

Foundation and the Governor’s_

Justice Commission have made

': contributions,” said Chess, “we

have to beg, borrow, and steal for
money.”

“It’s hard to sell this to the
public at large,” agreed Education
Director Joseph Angert. “They’re
not sure they want it.”

Jackson is positive about the
program, “I think the courses we
have here are very ‘good, but we
need more variety. Psychology and
statistics were introduced only

preparation.

recently.”

With a major in education,
Jackson is presently carrying 25
credits. He started with 12, but
found that with more work to do,
he’s actually doing better.

In addition to Pitt, he attends
Allegheny Community College and
expects to receive his associate
degree June 2'. He has also taken
courses from North Hampton
Community College [Bethlehem,
Pa.], and estimates those credits,
combined with the Allegheny
credits, amount to 85.

Jackson is a paraprofessional
teacher at the prison. He makes
frequent use of games and open
classroom techniques.

“I teach remedial English and
basic math,” he" explained. “Some
of the men here can't even spell
their own names. But they are
capable of achieving much_J.\more.
lt’s a new beginning for them.

“One of my students had trouble

with plus and minus signs. He kept-

making mistakes, and once I got
emotional and cussed at him. But I
learned that doesn’t work. Now, he
likes me best of all the parapro-
fessionals.” _
Jackson is appealing his case and
hopes to become a teacher. “The
question of whether an ex-con can
make it doesn’t bother me. I know
I have something to give to others.
My education is priceless.”
Other students seem to find their

_nam, Guam,
’Australia, Hong Kong, India,

education important, too. Accord-
ing to Chess, there is an abundance
of very high QPAs.

“A man sees it as his only
hope,” he said. “They really put
out.” _

A lot of the students concentrate
on psychology and sociology,
added Angert. “These are the
areas where they’re suffering
privation.”

Jackson sees himself as one of
the more experienced prisoners. A
Vietnam veteran, he enlisted at 17
and spent four years and , four
months in the third marine division
of the Navy.

“I’ve been around the world 3%
times,” said Jackson. “I’ve been
to Mexico, Madrid, Cuba, Viet-
the Philippines,

France, and Jamaica.

“My experience really helps me
in class. But sometimes I’m
considered a radical, since I
disagree with the teachers a" lot.
What the teacher knows, or what
the book says, doesn’t always
coincide with what’s happening out
in the world.” -

When Jackson came to the

prison in May 1971, he felt the pain -

and fear of loneliness.
‘_‘People had warned me that this

place was a madhouse, that I could

get raped or beat up, especially
since I’m a smaller man.”
“But since I’ve been here, I

haven’t been in any lights or big
arguments. It seems like they want
you to act like an animal, but I stay
cool.

“They make wine -here, and
there’s all kinds of narcotics --
sometimes I think there’s more
here than outside. But that’s not
my thing. I’ve seen too much of
what it does to people, expecially in
’Nam.”

The average stay in prison for a
man with life sentence is about 12
to 15 years, according to Chess.
But could Jackson’s enthusiastic
devotion to academia earn him an
earlier parole?

That is difficult to predict, said .

Angert. To get a commutation of
sentence or a parole, a prisoner
must go before the Governor’s
Pardon Board in Harrisburg.
“Not too long ago, ” explained
Angert, “the average stay (for a
life sentence) was 17.years. But

. little by little, the commutation

board is looking at solid accom-
plishments that show a sign of
willingness to adjust to society --
and a lot. of men are going up
before the board early.

“Right now we have a fellow
with a BA who will test the
commutation board to see if he can
set a landmark. But,I’m not sure it
will succeed.

“A bachelor’s degree is certainly
a good argument, but Tyrone
probably has .a long time to go.”

Boyle showed in The Candidate’
that he can approximate sanity in
his performances, but with Crazy
Joe he looks like a maniac even
when he’s not. He has an
upsetting habit of leaning forward
when he tries to make a point,
punctuating it with that vacuous
grin of his. And the way his eyes,
glisten and waver even during his
“serious” scenes give them an
uncomfortably out of place air of
absurdity.

Columbo, in this ﬂick Coletti,

Duckwolking Berry Rolls Over Arena Crowd

BY JIM MALONEY

Richard Nader's Rock-and-Roll
Revival hit the Civic Arena
Saturday night and mesmerized an
audience of screaming rock-and-
roll disciples.

The Bobby Comstock Band, the
Revival’s usual backup for all acts,
opened with an uneven medley of
standards, and DJ Chuck Brinkman
introduced the producer of the
Rock-and-Roll Showcase. Nader
originated the" now-famous revival
format with his New York City
concerts ﬁve years ago. His shows
have since toured extensively and
gained the reputation of the ﬁnest ’
in musical nostalgia.

The first group was the Angels,
three sugar cookies from the
1960-64 period--a group most
rock-and-roll purists would like to

forget. Their biggie “My Boy
Friend’s Back” drew the best
response.

Then came the Coasters (al-
though not the original members).
They opened with their 1958
“Yakety Yak,” from the pen of
Mike Lieber and Jerry Stoller.
They followed with “Searching,”
the song that thrust them into the

mainstream of 50’s rock-and-roll.
A reworked version of the Old
Clover’s tune “Love Potion #9” did
not fare well as their ﬁne delivery
of “Poison Ivy.” They ended with
“Charlie Brown," and paraded
offstage and on again like a
minstrel troupe.

Next in line was Johnny Maestro
and the Crests (now the Brooklyn
Bridge) who like matching bananas
strode onstage in yellow and black
tuxedos. Their hits included
“Calling All Angels" and “Sixteen
Candles]? and featured superb
vocal work by Maestro.

Thundering applause greeted
Chubby Checker. Fans were on
their feet, howling at the King of
the Twist, who mounted the stage
dressed like a Coney Island cabana
boy. I’ve never understood
Checker’s appeal. He used to
limbo under broom handles, and he
sure can twist, but so many other
seemed to be able to out-do his
attempts to go down as a
Rock-and-Roller [Berry, Little
Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis].

But nostalgia was in the air--and
the performance was snazzy and
energetic. He fancy-stepped his’

way through two funky numbers--
quite a feat in gold lame hi-rise
slippers. Fans exploded as he spun
into “The Twist.” This was the
original Twist--not one of the
countless followups (“Son ‘of
Twist," “I Remember the Twist,"
“The Twist That Ate Chicago.”)

Pandemonium reigned as the huge
spotlights swept the crowd, catch-
ing half the audience in vain
attempts to out-twist the master. A

few bars of “Whole Lotta Shakin”' _

ended the type of professional
performance that earned Checker a
berth on the Vegas nightclub
circuit. I

A brief intermission...Jackie
Wilson-resumed what was shaping
up as -a battle of costumes,
streaking out in penicillin pink
leotards and black space boots. He
opened with “Workout," ,and it
worked out just ﬁne. Wilson spent
the early ﬁfties with the Dominoes,

and is a no-nonsense R&B
screamer. His incredibly soulful
voice, in the Sam Cooke-early

James Brown vein, excelled in his
sixties’ hit “Higher and Higher."

You watch Wilson and know, that’s
why they call it soul, ‘kid. "He rolled

into a slow number with a tangy.

blues backup, and flaunted his
power as an exceptional blues
vocalist as he wailed "‘You Better
Stop Doggin’ Me Around.” He
more than warmed the stage for the
monster who followed.

As chants of “We Want Chuck”
shook the Arena, you could feel the
anticipation through your clothes.
He walked on, guitar case in hand,
and unpacked his instrument like a
trick-or-treater opening his bag to
show what he has. If Checker’s
ovation was wild, Berry's was
volcanic. '

He stepped to the mike to
announce a -“problem.” Some
incompetent had failed to set up
the ampliﬁers Berry requested,
and he was forced to share amps
with the Comstock band.‘ He was
rightfully upset, and promised to
do the “best I can. with this

equipment.” He then‘ calmly
stated, “I’ll never work for Richard
Nader again. I will be back to
‘Pittsburgh if you want me.”

The brittle tension was shattered
by the familiar rapid-ﬁre guitar of
the most important rock-and—roller
of all (including the Hound Dog).
“Roll"="Over Beethoven,” a song
that weaned the Beatles 3 and
wowed the teen-aged Rolling
Stones, tore the place down. Amp
problems or not, one got th feeling
that Berry could play a johnny mop
and make it sound good. He
flashed into the patented Berry
duckwalk, crouched like a crazed
Groucho Marx, and churned out
the beat. that has defined rock
music since 1955. “Sweet Little

BY LEE MARKOVITZ

As all Pitt sports fans know, we
have a good football team, a good
basketball team, a good hockey
club. and an improving swim team.
As all you Pitt sports fans do not
know. Pitt has a Rugby Club.

The team organized last year and
won four out of their five games.
The new season kicked off Saturday
by splitting a double-header with
Penn State--winning the first game
16-7 and losing the.  squad

game 9-0.
For those not familiar with_
rugby. ' it, ,is' a game faintly

resembling football, played on a

field of 70 yards wide and 110 yards"

long (not including two 15-yard end
zones). ’

Fifteen players per team attempt
to score either with a touchdown,
which is called a 4“try” [worth 4
points] and a 2-point conversion, or
with a drop-kick which, like the
field goal, is 3 points.

The ball is advanced by carrying
or'kickiiig it forward, hoping a
teammate‘ will recover the ball
downfield. ‘Only lateral passing is
blocking is
forbidden. f Play is continuous--
there are no huddles or time-outs.

When the ball carrier is tackled
he must release the ball and hike it
to the “scrum-half,“ who resem-
bles a quarterback. The scrum-half

A carries the ball until threatened by

a tackler and then. laterals the ball
to a teammate.

The process is "continued-as the
offensive team'is spread across the
ﬁeld and the ball is lateraled from
one player to the next in an attempt
to run around the opposition’s flank
or up the middle if an opening
exists.

The play ends when a tackle is
made and the next play is begun as
soon as the tackled player hikes the
ball to the scrum—lialf and the
running and laterals resume. The
ball is always free and can be stolen
by the opposition at any time.
Since there are no “downs" in
rugby.‘ stealing the ball ismthe most
common way to change. possession.

The players wear no protective

“scrimmage ragged”

“It's going to be an interesting
spring practice." Majors conti-
nued. "There's a whole lot to be
done and the coaches are going to
have their hands full."

The squad will return to action
late Tuesday afternoon. .

equipment and when an injury
occurs. that team must play
shorthanded since there is abso-
lutely no substitution. _

But according to law student and
player David Megnin, a major
injury is a rare occurrence. “l’ve
been playing rugby for seven years
and the worst injury I’ve ever seen
was a broken leg. -In fact, I can only
remember one injury which could
have been prevented by equip-
ment.” . T

Megnin is out of action now due
to"an injury he suffered last season.

“But nios_t injuries are to the
knees. sprained ankles, scrapes
and bruises." he insisted.

Law students comprise half of

the 40 memberteam, the other half‘

being dental students and a few
undergraduates. The team is
funded in part by the Student Bar
Association. In addition. each
member pays $10 in dues and must
buy his own uniform
includes cleated shoes. a jersey, a
pair of shorts, and knee socks.

The team is a member of the
Eastern'Rugby Union which grew
in 12 years from 20 teams to over
200 as..rugby_increased in popular-
ity. Megnin feels rugby may
become a varsity sport in the
future. “There are a lot of guys
who can’t make the football team
but who can play rugby.” '

“You've got to be fit because
endurance is just as important as
skill." Megnin said. Indeed it is;
The 80 rugged minutes of non-stop
battle in a rugby match is
interrupted by one short five-niin-
ute interniission. S

The rugby club has expanded its
schedule this‘ season, and plays
every weekend until May 4. Their
opponents include Penn State.
Indiana. Kent State. West Virginia,
and Wheeling College.

Just for the record, Saturday's
victory over Penn State by the “A"
squad was marked by 2 “tries"
scored by.T. Barr. one “try" by
Charley Leeper, and two 2 point
conversions by Mike Solomon and
Vic Lupkowitz. «

,TUCSON, Ariz. AP--John
Newcombe, fighting back from an
0-4 deficit "in the second set,
defeated Arthur Ashe 6-3, 7-6 to
winithe Tennis Games champion-
ship Sunday and a first prize of
$25,000.

The 29-year-old Australian won
his 13th consecutive match after
forcing the second set into a
tie-breaker, which he won 7-5.

Newcombe won the first set

_ when he broke Ashe’s serve in the

fifth game as the American
double-faulted.

Although Ashe had 13 service
aces, he was generally inconsistent
in getting his first serve in play.

That was what cost him the match I

tioned by the Association of Tennis
Professionals. I

Ashe took a commanding 4-0
lead in the second set, twice
breaking Newcombe’s serve and
winning 14 straight points. But

_ Newcombe battled back to win the

next four games, ‘and after each
won his next two serves. the set
went into the tie-breaker.

Ashe took the first two points in
the tie-breaker and then lost the
next two. On the deciding point,
Ashe hit his first serve into the net
and then chipped Newcombe’s
return shot on the next serve into
the net with’ his backhand.

promised Irvis. also a Pitt trustee.
“Then it's your tight with the

' University to see that the money

gets spent in the proper mann€f- I
can't do anything until students
have exhausted all possible oppor-
tunities for action within th€

According to Irvis, major changes
‘in the budget are nearly impos-
sible, although a certain amount of

 flexibility does exist on internal

options. He mentioned the
possibility of students testifying

V before the Appropriations Com-

rnittee.

Democratic Committeeman and
Pitt student Sam Rosensweig
claimed students won't benefit
from the $4 million increase due to
rising dorm fees and faculty salary
increases.

‘You have to realize that the
University's costs increase along
with the budget." said Romanelli.
‘'If we can just maintain tuition at

Rosenzweig emphasized student
concern over a possible tuition
increase within the next two years.
Irvis seem pessimistic:

“I think you'll definitely get a
tuition hike within the next two
years. You know my answer to that
situation. Free higher education.
But your immediate problem is to
work for the most efficient
allocation of the money within the
University."

Both legislators expressed dis-
appointment in the lack of active
student political activity, and
emphasized greater use of their
services. ‘

‘‘It’s part of my duty as a
legislator to stay in touch with
what's happening at the Univers-
ity." said Romanelli. “I'd like
students to remember that I'm as
close as their phone, and I'd be
very happy to set up meetings like
this on a monthly basis."

“I want you to spread the word
that this office is a place where
students can come with things like
PHEAA problems." Irvis said. “If
they don't get immediate solutions,
they'd at least have called the
matter to my attention."

-the death penalty.

 

(Continued from Page I)

argued. to express “the philosophy
that the death penalty should be
used as a method of social
retribution and vengeance, as a
way ofexpressing society's outrage
at such crimes as murder in the
course of a robbery.

“This philosophy results in the
taking of human life without
affording any additional protection
for the victim. And it is therefore
clearly unjustified on either moral
or public policy grounds.”.

Representative James A. Ro-
manelli (D-22nd District. which
includes part of Oakland) voted for
the bill but agrees with Governor
Shapp. "In some cases it is
absolutely necessary to protect
police officers and prison guards.
but I have mixed emotions about
" He went on to
differentiate between murder with
criminal intent and murder by
accident. as in the case of robbery.

The Deputy Warden of Alle-
gheny County Jail James J.
Jenning also feels the vetoed bill
was too strong. “I believe in the
death penalty if the killing was
intentional."

He felt there are times when the

‘system' can be faulted. “If a man
is unemployed and without an
education. he is almost forced into
committing a robbery. If in
carrying out the felony, someone
was killed accidentally, Jenning
said he did not consider the death
penalty an appropriate sanction.
Debate over the bill does not end
with the issue of which offenses
should be punishable by death.
The governor questioned the
constitutionality of a section giving
a jury discretion ‘to substitute life

imprisonment for the death penalty‘

if the defendant could prove he was
under severe physical duress. A
mercy plea could be entered on

' grounds of age or youth. Shapp

criticized this section as “hope-
lessly vague.”

Despite the fate of the bill,
Shapp doesn't expect to make a life
or death decision as long as he is
governor. He predicted the -bill
would be tied up in court for
several years. ’

The legislature's bill was inten-
ded to meet the objections raised
by the US Supreme Court when
they rendered unconstitutional all
state laws on the death penalty.
Two of the five majority judges in
that decision said the death penalty
