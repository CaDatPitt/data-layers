Cap and Gown Review
Newsman, Publicity Manager
Evaluates ‘Head Over Heels’
In Frankly Critical Manner

The following review of the Cap and Gown production, “Head Over
Heels,” was written by E. Seymour Kerber, who drops his guise as pub-
licity manager for the show, and reassumes his ethics and his integrity as
a member of the Pitt News staﬁ‘.

The much-publicized 150 men of Cap and Gown threw their “hearts,
legs, and souls” into their work last Monday evening and although they
wil- not rate four bells the-y deﬁnitely will not get a gong.

Under the tutelage of Edward A. Morgan, and Max Adkins, director
and musical director, the boys and “girls” went on the stage “in the
groove.” In fact they were almost in a rut. for the famous miscues, out-
of-steps, and dropped lines that make Cap and Gown what it is were
missing. The sparkle had given way to precision.

The electrical staff, under designer James Lindsay, made up for the
cast and chorus in supplying a disproportionate share of errors. They op-
parently forgot that the audience, while appreciating the beauty of
the new Cap and Gown sets and the play of lights on them, does not evi-
dence an interest in the ease with which switches can be thrown to dis-
concerting_y bring sunlight into night scenes.

But the cast and chorus came through “Head Over Heels” (by George
Hyde, ’40) with a good show, paced by undegraduate Cap and Gown
president Edwin Trembath as Adrienne Butterﬁeld and William Rial as

Sadie Plotgut.

Rial, as the society reporter suddenly made prima bal-

lerina in “Ninotchka’s Dream,” and Trembath, as the regular ballerina re-
turned in the “Swing Ballet,” won the acting and dancing honors.
Assisting Trembath and Rial were Richard Lambie as Johnny Hig-
gens, a newspaper reporter, who sang (as last year) most of the romantic
songs, and Robert Soles, as Mickey Finn, alias Beatrice Fairface, love-

lorn editor.

James Du.nn, as Kasper I-la1‘old (Mud) l\lulligan, did his best

but lacked the appearance of age to cinch his part.

Allen Gould, as the Russian balletmaster, and Jerome Lieber, Paul
De-merit, and John Knoll, as the remainder oi‘ the Butterﬁeld family, Mr.,
Mrs., and brat Suzie, perform-rd capably.

Lead chorine Martin Schlesinger, (2.5 Lana Corio (sans strip) stroked

the “gins” and ably placed his share ol “give” into the line.

Edward Huf-

nagle, Cap and GoWn’s photogenic beauty, spoke Connie Ott’s lines, while

livening the stage.

Harold Goltsman and Alexander End}/, as the two bill collectors try-
ing to catch Johnny, sing a set of very amusing lyrics by Go_tsman.

and Gowners gave full credit to the music of the six 2.uidcrgrad'uat.e and
two graduate composers. Max Adkins, in the pit, gave the mu:~:i<; all it

could take.

-vi‘yﬁ'\

The best parts of Cap and Gown have always been its dancing and

specialty numbers.

“Head Over Heels” again presents these highlights,

introducing two freshman with professional experience, Lester Evans and
Curtis Greenberg, who contribute “crook and a cop” and “soup and fish”

tap dances.

To assist cast members Rial, Trembath, and Schlesinger in their dances,
clrrcctor Morgan has added choreography for Sig Edelman and freshman

William Torquato, in the ballets.

Torquato also dances in a manner indica-

tive of three more coming Cap and Gown shows.
Best staged, most likely number of “Head Over Heels” is the Stage

Door Johnny number which opens the second act.

Leo Hart.er sings solo,

backed by a vocal chorus and John Fulton as an offstage voice, in ii ballacl
of the stage door romances. Monday’s rendition of this number was‘ con-
siderably hampered by What author Hyde called the “typewriter” changing
of lights‘ and the incompetent manipulation of public address system.
Mrs. Maude Corkan has clothed her charges in the finest of the new
fashions she could find in such in out-of-stock sizes as husky boys need.
During the formal dance scenes the stage resembles a Butterick cover.
Production manager Frank Mateer has organized a skilled stall‘ oi’

workers.

"Head Over Heels” has forsaken many of the old Cap and Gown

bugaboos or‘ misplaced props. wrong dresses, and unlighted cigars.
All in all, “Heads Over Heels” is a balanced show, especially for Cap

and Gown.

To be sure, it may lack some of the aforementioned “sou.”

of the previous shows, but what it ‘lacks it makes up for by improvement
in settings. costumes, and precision of dancework. Sans technical “bugs”
the thirty fourth punny Cap and Gown production will open its third show-
ind tonight at 8:28 and run to 11 o’clock through an evening’s pleasant

entertainment.

Comes from Dancing Family

No wonder he’s doing right. well
in C&G; he comes from a dancing
family.

Ten years ago Les Evans, C44,
started to work in the family var’e-
ty act. the Maryetta Company.
“I-low long have my mother and
father danced?” repeated Les. “Oh.
they were in the Keith circuit 111
New York and they still do a num-
ber arranged by G€01"i2l€ P1'im1'059>
the well-known soft shoe dancer.”

Les started his career on a danc-
ing tour through the south with his
moT.‘ner. father and sister. While
he was still in high school, they
worked with Johnny Perkins at the
Alvin theater in Pittsburgh, with
Charlie Barnett in Buffalo, with
Tommy Dorsey at the Royal Con-
aught hotel in Hamilton, Ontario,
and with Red Nichols in Altoona.
And they vcorked in show units dur-
ing the summers.

Take Syphilis
Test Monday

Campaign to Continue
Through This Week

With 326 students who clamored
to take the Wassermann blood test
on Monday a deﬁnitely favorable
barometer, the plan to have every
student. in the University take the
syphilis detection exam continues
today.

That the program is going ahead
successfully may be seen by this
statement of Lola Hoffman Robb,
nurse assistant to Dr. Auleene M.
Jamison, director of the Women‘s
Student Health service, “I never
expected so large a student response
to this Wassermann campaign. I‘;
looks like long hours of overtime
work for us.”

Both directors of the Student
Health service Dr. H. C. Carlson,
and Dr. A. M. Jamison praised
those who had already taken the
test and repeated their earlier
view that the plan was educational
rather than practical. They urged
those who were tested in previous
years to come and be tested again.

The tests are given free every
day from 9 o’clock until 5 o’clock
in the Health services of the Men,
on the thirty fourth floor, and the
Women, on the twenty eighth floor,
in conjunction with a plan worked
out by the Pitt News, the Health
service and the Pittsburgh Syphilis
Control program.

Compulsory Wassermann tests
for students entering their JLmi0r
year in the School of Dentistry has
been the rule since 1931. So far
the tests have only been referred to
as voluntary for other students in
the University.

Dr. Carlson warns against a last
minute rush to take the test. Since
the whole procedure of 1'egiste1‘i1"x;;j
and testing takes only five minutes
1):. Carlson states that any spare
minute could be put to best advant-
age by taking the test.

Student participation merely in-
volves going to either one of the
health services giving a blood with-
drawal of about 5 to 8 cubic centi-
meters, not enough to make the
slightest difference to the individ-
ual.

The blood analysis is being car-
ried on in the city’s health labora-
tories under the direction of Dr.
Millard C. Hanson and John St.
Peter, assistant director.

Dr. Millard has listed syphilis as
one oi’ the six leading causes of
death in the United States. The
only way of detecting this disease
is by blood. test. It is Dr. Mi11ard’s
goal to make “blood tests as much
a ‘matter of routine as seeing your
dentist.”

All results of the tests are con-
fidential and there are no ﬁgures
available as to per cents or ratios.
When the city laboratories make
a report to the Health services the
services will pass the results on to
the individuals concerned.

If the number of students re-
mains fixed or increases the total
is almost certain to go over the
2,570 record set in 1937.

To Active Service

Called into active service by the
Navy department, Omar C. Held,
personnel assistant to the dean of
the College for 13 years, has left
his post at the University.

A lieutenant, senior-grade, in
the United States Naval reserves,
Dr. Held was notiﬁed by the Navy
department to report to the Naval
Training Station at Norfolk, Va.,
before May 15.

Commenting on Dr. Held’s de-
parture, Dr. Stanton C. Crawford,
dean of the College, said, “Dr.-
Held’s absence from the Univer-
sity will represent a great loss to
his associates in the College office
and especially to the students of
the College. ‘His kindly interest: in

lorts in behalf of individuals need-
ing advice and counsel will be dif-
ficult to replace.”

Dr. Held has been granted 2: leave
of absence by University officials.

Geise Attributes Germany’s Success to Support

From Lower Middle Class,

Germany's success in defeating
over hall’ of Europe was attributed
by Dr. John J. Geise, assistant pro-
fessor of history, who spoke at last
Mc.nday’s Pitt Town meeting. to
the "fatalistic and vigorous sup-
port of the lower middle class and
a new Germim. war machine.”

The lower middle division in
Germany, stated Dr. Geise, was the
hairdest hit social class following‘
World War I. “This class,” he said.
“composed mostly oi’ p:oi_'essi0n'<‘il
men and small business owners.
feared to slip back into the prole-
tariat class. By promising not only
economic recovery but even an ad-
vancement, and by removing the
impediments to this goal, Hitler
gained its support. The French and
English iailed to realize this at the
beginning of the present war.”

By citing several instances from
history, Dr. Geise showed how the
introduction of a new weapon can
revolutionize military tactics. “Just
such a weapon was introduced by
the Nazis," explained Dr. Geise.
"The reason for the efficiency of
the Nazi war machine is the Organ-
ization of mechanized forces with
the air force, and coordination in
timing.”

“But.” said Dr. ~Ge'ise, “the ques-
Iion arises whether this remarka-
ble war machine is the only reason
for the success of the Nazi party."
He then went on to show that its

analyzes Nazi success

success is due mostly to its person-
nel, that is. an officer class drawn
from the German lower middle
class.

Previous to VVorld War I, ex-
plained Dr. Geise, the officer class
was drawn from the aristocracy,
then following the war when this
class of officers was discredited, Hit-
ler made it possible for officers to

be chosen from the lower middle
class.

Dr. Geise continued. “since I
have stated that the Nazis are suc-
Cessiul and supposing ihey continue
to be so. it is necessary to consider
wnzxt development this success calls
for. First of all Germany must
cozuinue to expand. This would
mean the elimination of England.
and the demobilization of Russia by
a military defeat or otherwise. And
second. following the armistice in
Europe. still supposing that Ger-
many ‘wins. she must expand fur-
ther to gain new colonies."

Concerning the possible defeat
of Germany, Dr. Geise stated that
the only way she might be defeated
is on the field of battle. “I don’t
think there will be an internal rev-
olution in Germany." he added.

Dr. Geise concluded his talk by
explaining that the condition of
the German people following World
War I was not a condition peculiar
only to themselves. They faced
the same problem that the other
peoples of the world faced follow-
ing ihe great war and close on the
heels of a universal depression.

The solution that the German
people gave to this problem, ex-
plained Dr. Geise, was the social
revolution called Naziism. But
other people of the VVestern world
faced much the same problem, and
that was shrinkage of the world
market in a capitalistic society.

Annual Smelter

At 3 Tonight

Departments Present
Original Stunts, Skits

Informal entertainment, prizes

and refreshments make up the pro-
gram for engineering and mines
students at the annual stunt night
smoker of the Engineering associa-
tion in Trees gym this evening at 8
o‘clock.

Feature of the entertainment is
the program of acts planned by the
six engineering departments. Rep-
resentatives from each section will
attempt to put on the funniest acts.
in competition for a cup awarded
by the association. When the cup.
given for the most original and en-
tertaining stunt, has been won three
times, it may be kept by the win-
ner, according to Paul Papanek.
E41, president of the association.
So far the cup has been won once
by the mechanical engineers.

As in past years, some of the acts
will include home-talent, make-
shift orchestras and bands, one—act
plays on life. of the engineer, and
several attempts at panning and
imitating professors in engineering.

Edward Edge, E41, chairman.
states that admission will be by an
Engineering association member-
ship card or 25 cents. The cards,
which can be used for admission to
the smoker and the engineers’ Jal-
opy dance on May 2, may be ob-
tained from any cabinet member
for $1, according to Papanek. All
engineering and mines students and
anyone interested are invited to at-
tend the affair.

ta-:‘tiz-s and complete ﬁnal arrange-
inents. including the caucus \vh':-;-ii
will be conducted Thursday in the
Penn-Harris hotel at ‘.e state cap-
ital.

A bill to increase the Unive'sity
state appropriation to ?ri5.()0'{),000
will be introduced by the Pitt dele-
gation in the model state legisla-
ture when it “takes over” the gov-
ernment from Thursday through
Sunday.

The Pitt state appropriz.-tior. in-
crease bill suggests, it the proposed
sum is approved, that tuition fees
of state—subsidized schools be re-
duced to half the present amount.

An increase in salary lor Univer-
sity instructors with a minimum
of $3.000 a year also is proposed
by the bill which maintains such a
measure would increase the calibre
of the University staff. Some fac-
ulty members now make less than
$2,000 a year.

A sum could be appropriated for
a student union building, the meas-
ure suggests.

Funds for such a bill should be
raised by a new state graduated in-
come tax. according to the proposal
which also suggests the appropria-
tion of other state or state-subsi-
dized schools also should be ade-
quately increased.

Other proposals of the U;-iversit_v

I. A state -owned and operated
lottery system.

2. Reenactment. of the liberal
compensation act. of 1937 to replace
the act passed in 1939.

llitler’s Birthday
And the l ‘azi Press

QUOTATIONS FROM THE NAZI press fre-
quently contain some very surprising comments,
the implications of which seem to have escaped
braintrusters of the Nazi propaganda offices.
Yesterd.ajv’s Berlin dispatch in which Press Chief
Dr. tto Diet ich released a statement on Adolf
Hitler's ﬁfty-second bi1*thdav contains two such
quotations.

Dr. Dietrich began by speaking of Hitler’s
“Napoleonic enterprises.” The comparison is cer-
tainly apt. and Dr. Dietrich may have imagined
that the world would be much impressed by the
corn‘_.3arison between Europe’s two greatest con-
querors of modern times. What Dr. Dietrich
seems to have forgotten—and what the rest of
the world cannot but recall with pleasure when
Hitler  compared to Napole-on——is that the
French emperor ended his days as an exile-
prisoner

And then. probably without meaning to do so,
Dr. Dietrich gives damning evidence of the per-
version of Nazi thinking. According to Dr. Diet-
rich, the fuehrer’s military decisions are part of
his “creative planning.” For home consumption,
that statement might have been all right; but the
civilized world has not yet retrogressed to the
point where it considers the total destruction
incident to total warfare as “creative” in any true
sense of the word.

The efficiency of the Nazi propaganda ma-
chine has been widely heralded, but the failures
in its attempt to convert the non-Nazi world to
totalitarianism far outweigh its successes. The
reason, it would seem from Nazi press dispatches.
is that the Nazis simply do not think as do more
civilized men and are incapable of understand-
ing the workings of the non-Nazi mind, which so
often reads into Nazi statements implications ex-
actly ooposite to those intended by their authors.

lTI1e  poldic By S. F. Ayers

The double feature performance of the SFA execu-
tive committee last week-end was another demonstra-
tion of the obvious need for revising the SFA nomina-
tion procedure. At least, this is what campus observers
are saying these days.

Empowered by the present constitution to make all
oﬁicial noininations, the executive committee passes
on every student-submitted petition and also has the
power to malre additional nominations itself.

It is very seldom that the committee ever rejects
a petition, signed by the necessary 25 endorsers, be-
cause, as one SFA faculty man recently put it, “Any
person who has the initiative enough to petition de-
serves consideration by the student body in the general
elections.”

 Thursday, however, hyperpolitico Fred Robie,
independent. boss. smashed precedent and putched
through the removal of a fraternity man and show-
ed to an SFA assembly governed by an overwhelm-
ing f1‘a?::1'nity majority what could be done under the
present constitutional set—up.

Note: Of course, he also showed the independents what
the fraternities could do if they ever got good and
mad at the GDI’s.

llobi-0'5 removal of the Sigma Chi candidate on
Thursday won’t mean much this year because at the
Sunday evening session of the executive committee the
independent leader put back the fraternity candidate
into the running by making a motion to reconsider the
case.

But this power to remove the names of students who
have submitted their names by petition isn’t the main
gripe against the powers of the executive committee.
It could we). become a first rate irritating spot if fra-
ternity and independent leaders took more advantage
of it more.

The worst feature of the nominating procedure is
the power of the executive committee to make additional
nominations itself.

Theoretically, they do this to insure the placing of
sixty candidates into the ﬁeld, thus assuring that there
will be two candidates for each position.

In practice, however, this device is used simpiy as
a political; instrument by both campus parties to sab-
atoge the slates of their opponents. This is done some-
thing like this: The fraternity men will suggest the
name of a popular independent (not slated by the in-
dependents, of course) and with the support of three
faculty votes in the executive committee their motion
will go through. The independents will counter by
naming :1 popular fraternity man and again with the
support of the same three facu-ty votes their trick will
go through.

That is why you will see non-slated “big fraternity
names” such as Doug Svenson, Adeline Butera, and Bob
Goleman on the voting machines this year. They were
nominated by the independents for the sole purpose
of confusing supporters of the Delta Tau Delta, TPA,
and Phi Eps slates.

On the other side of the fence, you will see the
names of Druid Tom Bole and Pitt Newsman Fred
Lange, up and coming sophomore leaders, who were
nominated by the fraternities in order to scatter in-
dependent support.

To campus political leaders such monkey play is a
lot of fun and it makes work in an otherwise routine
student government a little more interesting.

But to the average student at Pitt who still con-
ceives of SFA as what he is told in orientation classes
and in the Compass and Vade Mecum, the effect is a
wee bit nauseating.

Two American W’ omen
Write First Rate Novels

We are a generation who are too often smart and
glib, more interested in the superﬁcial aspect of peo-
ple and objects than in basic qualities. In writing.
this glibrtess is very much apparent; literary writing
nowadays is more smooth and technically perfect than
it has ever been, but it is surprising what a small
amount of honest thinking the average play or novel
of today contains. Not all living writers have been
inﬂuenced by high pressure advertising and the short
stories in “New Yorker,” however; we still have writers
of quality trying to express the ideas and temper of
our times.

Two of these ﬁrst rate American writers are women,
and each of them has published, within the past few
months, a novel which has added to her reputation as
a creative artist and which promises to be read by
literate Americans for some time to come.

Different, Yet Alike

Willa Cather and Ellen Glasgow have developed
different kinds of writing, but they are alike in two
ways. First of all, both are literary stylists dealing
with a small (rather than inclusive) part of the Amer-
ican scene, and, second, one can review their literary
careers and ﬁnd that it has grown step by step, be-
coming intellectually more capable and mature as the
years passed. It is this last quality that is usually a
mark of the great artist. Sinclair Lewis represents, to
me, the writer who is of the other extreme: early in
his career Lewis struck upon an idea and a style that
was ﬁrst-rate, and he has been presenting it ever since
with excellent ﬁnancial returns but very little intel-
lectual growth. Glasgow and Cather, however, have
matured as people and as novelists, and to trace their
careers, beginning with the ﬁrst novels and ﬁnishing
with their latest, is a very gratifying experience.

In This Our Life

Of the novels, “Sapphira and the Slave Girl” by
Willa Cather and “In This Our Life” by Ellen Glas-
gow, the latter seems to me the superior work. It is
not superior in style and the sheer force of its writing,
but it has more to say than Miss Cather’s novel. “In
This Our Life” takes the reader to a modern Virginia
household, and presents the thoughts and doings of a
small, highly civilized group of people.

The Characters 

There is Asa Timberlake, the father, who hides his
fear of life behind a gentle ironic smile; his wife
Lavinia, an artist in invalidism; and their two daugh-
ters, Roy and Stanley. Roy is Asa’s favorite daughter,
a strikingly ﬁne and intelligent girl who has adopted
her father’s pose as a way out. When Stanley runs
away with Peter, Roy’s ﬁance, Roy buys a red hat
and is “wonderful about it.” Peter takes his own life,
and Stanley comes home, a subdued and unhappy
woman.

by Ellen Glasgow

“' 45 V_

These are the people Miss Glasgow writes about,
people who live and move in a small strata of Amer-
ican society. “In This Our Life” is a carefully written
story about these people; it might well be called a
comedy of manners, for hovering over it is Miss Glas-
gow’s penetrating smile.
Sapphira and the Slave Girl by Willa Cather

‘“Sapphira and the Slave Girl” is also set in Vir-
ginia, but the story begins in 1856 and leads up to
Miss Cather’s childhood. In Miss Cather’s preceding
novel, “Lucy Gayheart,” she told the story of a mid-
western girl who falls in love with a man already
married, a theme that has been handled too many
times for the pleasure of the reader. But in “Sapphira”
the theme is the persecution of a mulatto girl by her
mistress. Miss Cather does things like this very well;
it is in the vein of “A Lost Lady” and “My Mortal
Enemy,” that of the frustration of a sensitive central
character caught in some subtle, overpowering web.

There is page after page of very objective prose that
conveys to the reader in some suggestive way that a
powerful human drama is being enacted before his
eyes. Miss Cather is one of the most restrained of
writers: there is no shreiking or pulling of hair among
her characters. She conveys their perceptions with a
cool, accurate phrase that contains dynamite. “Sap-
phira and the Slave Girl” is not Willa Cather’s best
novel, but it is good American ﬁction.

Current Comments

7/ouﬂz Qwapd

.By Jack deBenedictis

The college scene is being clut-
tered up with. youth organizations
again, the latest additions being the
college division (reads like an order
of the day) of the Committee to De-
fend America by Aiding the Allies
and the Student Defenders of De-
mocracy.

Both groups advocate full aid to
Britain and all it implies, and both
are made up of luke warm Roose-
veltian liberals. They believe in
the rights of labor, vaguely. And
they are the foremost intervention-
ist groups on most campuses.

The CDAAA group publishes a
little propaganda sheet called
“Crisis.” To illustrate this group’s
luke warm labor sentiment, and
very luke warm it is, we quote:
“Successful evasion of the law by
a prominent industrialist begins to
suggest undemocratic discrimina-
tion.” That is not exactly what one
would call 3 fortright statement on
labor policy. I/Vho could be more
polite?

The Student Defenders of De-
mocracy are almost as weak. For
instance they call Representative
Sumne-rs “electric chair for strikers”
statement, “intemperate and un-
democratic.” The Texas represen-
tative’s statement requires, we feel,
a little stronger denunciation.

The CDAAA is by far the stronger
and more literate, if their “Crisis”
is any indication. They say that
they believe in some form of world
wide political organization, though
they are not very explicit about it.
They believe that if it is necessary
to go to war to destroy Hitler, we
must go to war.

They are liberals it is true, but
not very explicit liberals. They are
honest, but they aren’t very ex-
plicit about anything except aid to
Britain. They are confused like the
history prof from Columbia who
writes that our “choice is not be-
tween two absolutes, but between
two relatives . .” and who makes
the relatives “absolutes” by using
the ﬁgure “two.”

But they’re still kids, and they’re
trying.

Doomed At Penn Relays

Sprint Medley, -ll’-10 Relay, 330 Relay
Only Panther Titles Likely to Stand

.By BEN F0512
Despite last Saturday ’s

surprising defeat at the liamls of the

Ohio State track team, coach Carl Olson squad looks forward with
anticipation to the 47th annual Penn Relays at Franklin Field this

Frielay and Saturday.

For three years Pitt athletes liave doiiiiiiatetl this aif-air—tl1e

the ebony ﬁyer will match strides
America‘s best dash men
in the feature invitation event Sat-
urday afternoon.

Dusty Rhoades and Red Jessup,
the pole vaulting juniors, and Jim
Elliott, best javelin tosser in the
East are also top ﬂight individual
entrants for the local squad. Ted
Konetsky seeks the discus crown,
but Al Blo7.:'.~; the Georgetown mas-
tadon will be tough to beat.
Stickel Question Mark

In the relay events. the Panth-
ers will ﬁrst defend their 4'-10-yard
crown. Should they successfully
retain the title, they will retire the
trophy, having carved two of the
required three niches in the cup.
In addition to Carter, only certain
starter is Larry Tregoning, a mem-
ber of four past championship four-
somes in the carnival.

Others vieing for positions on
these squads are Del Anderson, Re-
gis Larkin and Bud Graf. Should
Hap Stickel’s leg injury respond
to r.reo.tinent he would insure 2-1
successful title defense. The same
group also shapes up about the
same way for the 880-yard relay.
A surprise victory in this event
would also retire this loving cup,
two legs having been gained in
19:38 and 1939.

Panthers Hold V/orld Record

Other combinations show Larkin,
Tregoning, Carter and Anderson in
the mile sprint medley, running
440 yards, 220 yards, 220 yards,
and 380 yards respectively. The
Panthers hold both the carnival and
world record in this event——3:24.5.

Pitt mile relay _ combinations
have written the most brilliant
chapters into the log of the Penn
Relays. To uphold the standard
of past performances it must de-
pend on Larkin, Tregoning, Graf,
and Anderson. The Panthers hold
two legs on the Mike Murphy Chal-

PiK A-Kap Sigs
Meet i11 Crucial

IF Leagiie Tilt

Undefeated Phi Eps
Risk Lead Tomorrow

Notice-—Any student interested
in umpiring intramural mushball
games should contact Mr. Potts
in his office at Trees gym this
week.

Backed by one of the best teams
in the in*:‘afraternity'circles, P:?KA
pitcher Fred "'.n0-hit" Davis will
attempt totwirl his team to victory
over a much weaker Kappa Sig‘
nine tomorrow.

Davis, who has already pitched
one no-hitter over the Phi Gams, but
still was a victim of two costly
errors in losing 2-1, is well sup-
ported by a star studded inﬁeld
lead by Ralph Wilde, Dick Fair,
ond John Syka, plus a slugging out-
ﬁeld of Carl Anderson, “Whitey”
Carlson. and Gus Wilde.

The Kappa Sigs have not been
tested as yet this year, since they
won from Lambda Chi Alpha. Out-
side of footballer Kracum and in-
ﬁelder Conley of last year’s squad
they will be depending solely on
newcomers.

Another interesting contest will
be the one in which the Phi lips
will be risking a perfect record
against the Phi Kaps, who have
built up an admirable record after
losing their opening contest on a
forfeit.

Both of the Phi Ep victories have
been over formidable foes, de-
feating the defending champion
Sammies and the Phi Delts by over-
whelming scores. ‘ '

Wally Hirsch, the team’s slugger,
who hit homers in both of the pre-
vious games, is expected to be a
big help to Jay Silverberg as he
attempts to pitch his third straight
triumph.

Opposing him on the mound will
be Mike Sote-ck, who shut out the
SAEs, 9--0, last week. Hughes and
Glenn are the men whose slugging

hasbeen a feature of all the Phi
Kap games.

game, the Pitt men really found out

fifth inning.

shot was heard. The two thousand

Larry dropped out of school for a

College Men
As W7orkers

Woinen Supplement
Incomes from Home

By Student Opinion Surveys of
Ameﬁm.

AUSTIN, Tex., April 23.—-Work-
ing while going to college is noth-
ing new to the American collegian.
But ﬁgures of a national study just
completed reveal that there is act-
ually 2. majority of college men
who are today earning all or part
of their expenses.

Surprising also may be the fact
that almost 36 per cent of the coeds
perform some work to supplement
their incomes from home or schol-
arships.

The signiﬁcance of this research
conducted by Student Opinion Sur-
veys of America for the Pitt News
and other undergraduate newspa-
pers that support this institution,
lies not only in the statistics pro-
duced, but in the extensiveness of
the survey itself. For nearly three
years on hundreds of campuses, in-
terviewers have been asking stu-
dents, “Do you work to pay all or
part of your college expenses?”

The results are based on close to
25,000 personal interviews which
began in 1938, and ended last
month. Ten separate national
samplings have been taken on this
subject, each representing a care-
fully derived cross section of the
total enrollment.

The Survey charts a rising curve
of student employment. During the
latter part of 1938, in 1939, in 1940,
and continuing in 1941, the number
of collegians who Work is ever in-
creasing, although this rise has
been only a iew percentage points.

There is a vast difference between
the number who work for only part
of their living costs and those who
are actually “working their way
through.” There are of course
more men—one seventh——able to
support themselves entirely that
there are women—one twentieth.
Complete tabulations show:

There are collegians who sweep
halls of learning for their date
money. Many wait on tables for
their meals. Those with higher
scholastic standings are graders
and coaches, and among the less
scrupulous there are ghost writers
who supply term papers for hand-
some fees.

Thousands receive up to $15 a
month from their National Youth
administration jobs. Colleges and
universities employ a great many
as pages in their libraries and the
variety of student ()C(:L1pat§(ms is
staggering.

Wilso-n Leaves

Continued from page one

General Staff school at Fort Leav-
enworth, Kan. in 1926.

Serving as :1 major during the
first World war, Colonel Wilson
was; made 2: temporary lieutenant-
colonel, a position which became
permalient. in 1935. Afteif active
duty in the Phillipine islands loi-
three years, Colonel Wilson became
a psofessor of militzlry science and
tactics at the University of St. Lou-
is where he taught for four years.

Being .~:hil'ted agxxin. Colonel
Wil-.~on .‘18l‘\.'€(l two years in the
Coax: Artillery corps in the Panama
Canal ztone bejore he finally came
to the University in 1937.

To succeed Colonel Wil.son, Col-
onel F.d.\v:-zrd L. Kelly, United
States arrny i‘cti1'ecl, has been or-
dered to the University on or about
lvlay 16, lrom which time he will
corroborate with Colonel Wilson
until the latter's departure.

Colonel Wilson is a mcmbel oi"
Sigimi Chi fr ternity and an hon-
orary member of the Gamma circle
of Omicron Delta Kappa, national
leadership honor society. Asked
about his stay at Pitt, Colonel Wil-
son stated that “My stay here has
been my happiest detail in 20 years.
and I regret having to leave, but
orders are orders.”

Also born in Missouri, Colonel
Kelly is a West Point graduate of
1909. He, like Colonel Wilson, is
a graduate of the Coast Artillery
school at Fort Monroe, and a grad-
uate olf the Command and General
‘taff school of Leavenworth. Also
a temporary lieutenant in France,
Colonel Kelly became a colonel in
July. 1938.

Colonel Wilson explained that
the transfer is in keeping with the
War departments present policy of
relieving active duty oﬁicers from
duty ivitli ROTC units for duty with
active troops. Retired army offi-
cers are being recalled to fill the
\'acan<-ies.

In Thaw Hall Phy

sics Department

. By JAMES C. PLUNKETT

Next fall the University will
have one of the iew “super eyes"
in science when the most powerful
electron microscope ever conceived
will be installed in the physics de-
partment in Thaw hall.

This new “super eye” is able to
magnify an object up to 100,000
times. A baseball enlarged this
much would have a diameter of
four and a half miles. A human
hair would appear as large as a
giant California sequoia tree.

The electron microscope is sci-
ence’s newest super detective, be-
ing so recent that it reached its
present perfection only in 1941. On
January 9, the convention of Radio
Engineers of America in New York
was told of the latest developments
of the machine, and on March 14 a
broadcast was made describing the
objects it showed. These objects
were so small that they could not
be seen by means of any other type
enlarger and consequently had nev-
er before been viewed.

Adding to the physics depart-
ment’s growing stock of the newest
scientiﬁc equipment, which recent-
ly was enlarged by the addition of
one 0:‘ the world’s ﬁve cyclotrons,
the new “super eye" is so rare
that only a few others exist at the
present time.

This microscope was produced in
..he laboratories of the Radio Cor-
poration of America at Camden, N.
J. Designed by James Hillier, it
was developed under the supervision
of Dr. V. K. Sworykin, director of
the RCA Electronic Research lab-
oratories, who received his doc-
tor’s degree in physics at the Uni-
versity in 1926.

The electron microscope differs
from the ordinary one in that it
bends electrons and forces them to
do the work of normal white light
in the common microscope. The
electron, being among the smallest:
known units of matter, has a very
small wave length and so is able to
enlarge an image too small for the
ordinary light waves. Since the
wave length of an electron is so
much smaller than that of a light
wave, it is possible to obtain mag-
niﬁcations up to 100,000 times.

The new scientiﬁc tool will be
housed in a shaft six and a hall

Camp Pitt Will Offer Stutlents

Enlarged Course This ;§'u..mm.er

Camp Pitt, the University’s answer to students who dream of taking

a vacation while adding a few credits to their record, will enlarge its

courses this season.

An advance course in recreatilon leadership, a course in bird study,

and a class in ﬁeld astronomy will

be introduced at this years ses-
sion. The popular camp counsell-

ing cour;—:.e will also be ampliﬁed.

Those students electing recrea-
tion leadership will study the tech-
-nical problems of organizing and
mzinarging a «C114l“ll1l) or recreation
center.

The special course in bird study,
wl1ic‘h supplements the regular na-
ture study program will emphasize
ﬁeld w.or.k in sight and sound iden-
tification. of birds in this area.

The field astiioniomy course is
designed to enable students to rec-
=ogn.ize “all the planets and constel-
lations above the horizon between
the hours oi’ nine and eleven o’clocl;;
during the three weeks Camp Pit‘-..
is in .~:ession,” according to Cecil
ll’. Mor;._>;an, in.structor in physical
education and director of the
camp.

Camp Pitt is a recreational edu-
cation course in practical and the-
oretical grounding‘, in the many
phases oi.‘ camp leadership ofl'erc(.l
to recreation leaders and camp
colmsellors from June 8 to 28. One
of the first universities to offer such
:1 course, Pitt lias found the camp
so successlul that the c.m'ollme:1t
each year is limited to around -10
students.

The camp is in the mountains at
Laurel Hill Recreation area, near
SOID.-’3l‘>'(:?I. In addition to the ne\\:
courses, nature study (plant, ani-
mal lite. and field geology iristruc-
tion). social music and folk danc-
ing, 1;-ro)',ects. handcralls. and camp
cralts are taught.
