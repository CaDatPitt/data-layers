open parking; $25 for unheated

A member of. the humanities

February, but that the, plans

‘they ‘-learned this month of the

’ He said he resented the way
the situation was being handled
and that he “resents having to
sign my name and sticker‘ num-

ber every time I use the lot. That‘

means.faculty' members are be-

Check Cash Hours

By JOSIE GROSSMAN
‘Student Government announced

"‘ the extension of oﬂice hours on

the 24th ﬂoor for cashing checks
and appointed a new alcohol com-
mittee at Thursday’s meeting.

1 Joyce Ruey reported that Paul
Boltacz, general manager of the
Book Center, preferred not to
have _a check-cashing service in
the bookstore because it involved
keeping extra money on hand. The
Office of Student Accounts’ change
of hours, however, “should take

ﬂjgcare of it,” Miss Ruey concluded.

The new hours will be 9 a.m.
to 9 p.m. on Monday‘ through
Thursday, 1 to 5 p.m. on Friday,
and 9 a.m. to noon on Saturday.
The day the change will go into
effect will be announced next
week.

,. Three Volunteered

Beth Baumgart, Steve Gersh-
man, and Ben Cardin volunteered
to evaluate the proposal and ma-
terial collected by last year’s al-
cohol committee. “It’s~ silly to

expect it to pass justbecause a
period of time has elapsed,” pres-
gent Tom Olofson told the sena-
. rs. .

 

—“The committee ‘ can reshape
the proposal in any way they
choose. They can involve the
_fraternal system or they _don’t
have to; they have a free hand.”
Bette Guttenberg reported that
she sopke to Richard Dearden of
Saga Foods. “He was very cordial
and obliging,” Miss Guttenberg
commented. “He asked that any
students with complaints or sug-
gestions come to him.” -
Questionnaire Discussed
When asked if the questionnaire
of two years ago would be re-in-
stated, Dearden replied that they
are planing for its distribution in
a couple months. On the question
of the quality of meat in the
cafeteria, Dearden stated that al-
though the prices are up and the
food service is paying more they
are still buying the same grade of
meat. Dearden felt that the stu-
dents were simply not used to
institutional food after eating at
home over the summer.

On the subject of the long
lines in the cafeteria, Dearden
said that this is to be expected
until the students get oriented
to their new schedules.

¢Newman, director of the WPDU,

and James Joseph. Those taking
the negative view were Richard
B. Gregg, assistant director of
WPDU, and Alan L. Cazen.

_ Make Credit Available

The basic arguments of the af-
firmative were that the establish-
ment of an -international bank
would make credit more available
to underdeveloped nations, would
facilitate trade between nations
through ﬁxed exchange rates, and
would promote internal stability.

The rebuttals of the negative
side won them the debate.
Gregg stated that underdevel-
oped nations have proven them-
selves incapable of development
simply because credit is avail-
able and that there is no real
liquidity problem.

C‘azen went on to say that “in-
ternal instability-must be reme-
died at the source” and that “in-
ternational currency could not be
the cure,” He also remarked that
the proposed superbank would
have no supergovernment to guide
it in the control that it’ would be
necessary to exert on member na-
tions.

The debate was held primarily
for practice and those in attend-
ance were mainly members and
prospective members of the Union.

Novice and varsity teams of
WPDU are scheduled for further
dabates tomorrow, Thursday, and
October 2. - .1 . .

erides Prejudice

In Any Form at Midday Program

Publisher Speaks
, To Crowd of 1200
BY ‘WM O’BRIEN
Only in America could an
ex-convict who once ran a
stock - racketeering Manhat-
tan “basket shop” be such a
powerful social critic as bar-
rel - shaped, cigar - chewing
Harry Golden, the first speaker of

this. year’s' fall Midday Series *

program.

The sharp-tongued Y a n k e e
newspaperman who publishes his
self-written newspaper, the Caro‘
lina Israelite. derided discrimina-
tion in any form before an esti-
mated crowd of 1,200 last Wed-
nesday.

He told his listeners toibeware '

or the “blue-plate-special” solu-
tions to current problems, yet he
did not advance any of his own
unique answers, such as the “Ver-
tical Negro Plan” or the Golden
“Out-of-Order Plan.”

He emphasized the long-time
cycle of self—advancement that
every race and color and ethnic
group has had to overcome in this
country, and how it is great be-
cause of this status clumb.

“I like to think of the Ameri-
can Dream that has no parallel,”
Golden said. “It is simply the
opportunity to enter ,the open
society of our culture without
any obstructions — just on your
own.

“The boy who once threw pea-
nuts to the customers at the base-
ball game years ago, today may {be
a minister, a banker, a teacher —
or even more important —- the
outfielder." .

He pointed out that the great-
est advancement in America has
been promoted by hungry people
who are hustling to _get even with
the people they ﬁgure are above
them. ' '

“If an immigrant kid had a
stethocope in his car,” he said,
“he knew he could go all the
way. He realized that he had
bridged the gap.”

And his ‘patients would say:

“Boy, my doctor has a cute
accent.”
Golden believes the darkest

hours were in the twenties when

‘the U. S. passed restrictive immi-

gration laws. “Not that I’m saying
that the immigrant is any better
than the native,” Golden said.
“Just the contrary. He knows he
lsn’t and he’s a vigorous worker
because he wants to elevate him-
self to that standard. He feels in-
Ierior and he must make good.”

(MANY PEOPLE were attracted

 

to hear Harry Golden speak at

Midday Series last Wednesday. The writer of Only In America

and For Two Cents Plain spoke

Golden says the Negro is the
immigrant of our modern so-
ciety today. “People say they're
pushing,” he exclaimed. “They
are not pushing; they’re just
escaping —- from the slums, and
disease and early death.”

He also explained the rise of the
Russians along the same line of
thinking. “They are immigrants to
us today,” he said. “They’re vigor-
ous. When will I be like them
(Americans) they say. So they
so, go, so-"

He inferred that it would be

of discrimination, illustrating his

points with tales of early immigrants and their successes.

wise for no one to be immigrants
in our eyes today. “France used to

»mean Joan of Arc ' or maybe

Lafayette,” he explained. “Eng-
land was a place where Henry
VIII had a lot of wives.

“Today we have to know who's

boss in Irag and who the prime’

minister of Cambodia is. They can
determine the kind of life your
children will live in-. It's a differ-
ent kind of world today. You must
have knowledge, complete aware-
ness and total involvement.”

SC Fills Senate

(Continued from Page 1)

Advisor N. Ronald Pease re-
ported that he has spoken to Dr.
Alan Rankin about a student di-
rectory. It’s ready to be printed,
he stated, whenever the money is
appropriated. ‘

Olofson asked the members of
the Foreign Student Committee to
read Vijay Jain’s article in the
September 17 supplement to The
Pitt News. “Make an appointment

A with him and talk about it. He'll

have some good ideas.”

The senate elected Al Schloss-
er and Beth Baumgart to fill the
vacancies in the ‘number of
Liberal Arts representatives.
Schlosser was previously direc-
tor of public relations for SG
and Miss Baumgart was director
of major events.

The senate then voted to par-
ticipate in the Activities Fair on
Friday. As in the past, two sen-
ators will be on duty from 9:30
a.m._to 3:30 p.m. to answer ques-
tions. Pete Bijur volunteered to
co-ordinate the plans.

Vacancies

.Richard ‘ Minker brought up
Dave Menzer’s suggestion thatthe
University have a Pitt Chest, to
collect for several agencies at once
rather than have it only for
United Fund. A percentageecould
then be given to United Fund
with the rest distributed among
the others.

_Olofson reported that he spoke
to Joel Filner, editor of the Owl,
about a section in the yearbook
for SG and the ‘seven governing
groups represented -in the senate.
Instead of having these groups
scattered throughout the Owl,
there could be one page of intro-
duction followed, by SG’s spread
and those of the seven organiza-
tions. Olofson said Filner “would
be willing to do this and thought
it was a good idea.”

Stabile explained to The Pitt
News. The University then is

He said that University mem-
bers, coming into the lot after
5:30 p.m‘. pay‘ the costs unless
special arrangements are made.
Professor Max A. Lauffer, dean-
of the natural sciences‘ division,

,stated that he did not know

whether or not‘ other division
deans were notiﬁed of the park-
ingichanges by Vice Chancellor
Peake at the same‘ time he was.

“I discussed the plans with, my

department , chairmen, l they . re-'

ported to their faculties, and I
reported back to Peake,” he said.
Dr. Lauffer‘ said‘ he was in
favor of the new arrangemnts
bcause they mean “larger park-

ing ‘facilities-income will be .

used to provide additional park-
 space.” - -
“I know that non-academic per-

sonnel at Western Psych are wor-
ried about the parking situation,”
he said. “Since parking assign-
ments have not been made yet,
we must wait and see what hap-
pens.”
_ The ‘plan calls for parking
space quotas to be allotted each
dean and director at the Uni-
versity. Each is then to'make
assignments within his depart-
ment.

‘Captain Charles Ray, head of P’?

the University’s Security Depart-
ment, said that his ofﬁce “doesn_’t
anticipate any change in opera-
tions—except that handling the
bookkeeping for the parking per-
mits will allow us better con-
trol of the situation.” ‘ - "
Early last week, Frank Car
ver, head of the University’s Ath-
letic Department, explained that
the special situation for parking

in his department necessitated .1’ a,_»

conference for clariﬁcation. He
was referring to the number of
cars that move in and out, ‘and
the guests parking. in lots con-
nected, with athletic facilities.

Symposium "Speeches
Concern Costitution

More Thans200 People Heard
Professors Speak Last. Sunday

By JOE. GREIF
Over the past two years,
the United‘ States Constitu-

tion has served as “a beacon.
,-.. to mankind.”

, So said Dr.‘ Edward M.
Burns, professor emeritus of

_ Political Science at vRut_g_ers ‘Uni-

versity at a symposium on con-
stitutional law held at the Stephen
Foster Memorial last Monday
evening.

v Speaking on, the long-enduring
Constitution, ~ he warned E, against
the risk of-becoming too wor-
§f4.ipful of it merely because it has

V"'laster ‘ so long.

Beloﬁ. Second M
The second‘ speaker of the
evening wasTProfessor Max Beloff
from the University” of “Oxford.
Beloif discused various aspects‘~' of
the British and American‘ consti-
tutional lset-ups as seen by, the
‘delegates ‘at the Constitutional

Convention. _
" Two differences he emphasized

r,,_»were:

. . 1) The American constitu-
tion is' set aside as an "almost
untouchable, fundamental law
that can be amended only‘
through 2. complicatedpand ex-.-'
tremely diiIie_ult' process. On the

other hand, the English_ Cousti- ,

tution can "be changed by a rou-
tine act of their national leg-
islature, The Parliament. .- V
2) L The Supre,me.Cou,rt’s prac-
tice of judicial- review- of state

' jand federal acts is in great con-

trast to the ’ English . s_ystem._ "In
England, the "judiciary ‘cannot
overrule Parliament ‘by declaring
its facts unconstitutionel.
Wright . Spoke _
Dr. Benjamin F. Wright was the
ﬁnal speaker. .Wright is a pro-
fessor of government at the Uni-
versity of Texas. He was for-
Mmerly the. chairman of the de-
’ ’partment of government at Harv-
ard University.
His topic was, "Why has the
American Constitution been so
' Durable?” In his speech he re-
ferred to the development of
our government under the Con-
stitution ‘as_ f‘an orderly series

of steps, each one based on the
one preceding it.”

This is signiﬁcant, according to
Wright, because the countries
that did not develop in this man-
ner are also those which have had
short-lived Constitutions.

Emphasized Amending

He emphasized the importance
of the establishment of ' the
amending process. .-This purpose,

cratic government, what the in-
vention of the wheel did for trans-

Graduate Decries

School Mechanization

Editor, The Pitt News

Pitt is a memory of frustra-
tions. There is the little ones
of not ﬁnding that book for your
term paper. V

Or the seemingly impossibility
of a graduate or undergraduate
group (except maybe the Pitt
News) taking a mature stand
of leadership and expressing the
interests of the students to the
other power groups even
though we are one of the larger
contributers to the University.

There is the frustration of
seeing the administration spend-
ing our money on a home, rather
than on books and periodicals
which can be of use to more
people—-if they feel that they
must have land for the long
term interest of the school, does

"this-.mean' that theydmust. spend
$26,000" to remodel a’ home right
now? ‘

When the time comes thatnwe‘

are another Harvard, I will not

protest the buying of homes; ‘but '

Pitt is-. still going through» a
period of auterity—in the sense
that we do have to ’watch7 our
money.

But the administration acts as
if we should‘ not 'care about
what happens to our money;
that‘ $40 or so a credit should
mean nothing to us. You begin
to feel. that -they have forgot-
ten that they are here to serve
us. »

‘I am afraid that we are no
more ' no ~- less-’ than an _I.B.M-.'

card to them. And why should
we say that the new grading‘
system is w’r‘ong—_-is itnot more
efficient to use a machine?

Why should the administra-
tion tella card what it is doing?
In theiriﬁowing robes the of-
ficials of the school metto ad-
dress a dead student body, a
stack of cards.

It is time that we stopped
being an I.B.M. card and organ-
ized ourselves into a group that
will be listened to and have
something constructive to say.

Budapest-Part One . . .

 Behind The

Curtain

By Joanne Bacher _

At seven a.m. Saturday morning the Mercedes
‘Bus, carrying 60 people, pulled away from the
Vienna Verkehrs Buro andheaded down the main
road to Budapest.

I sat back in my seat and examined the visa
now stamped in my passport. It
had been simple enough to ob-
tain permission. to visit Buda-
pest. One only had to present
an application with two photos,
passport, and $20 to “Ibusz” (the
travel agency.with sole govern-
ment rights to grant orrefuse
entry) before noon on the Mon-
day of the week one wished

to go.

Because I was an American
who “claimed” no relatives in
Hungary and only, wanted to “tour,”'I had no
difficulty in obtaining permission.‘ _ _~

I, had asked “Uncle” Mickey" of the Institute of
European Studies‘, who had escaped from‘ Budapest
in 1956 if he wanted me to take aﬁmessage or
something to anyone in the city, ormto bring some-
thing back. But, to this he replied, “That’s -very
kind of you. I would ‘ask you to see some of my

 

friends‘, but. they wouldn’t believe anything -you .

said or I wrote. They’re all so ‘afraid.’ They’re
«polite enough, ‘but afraid, and try to hasten

strangerseaway’. There is at least one informer in‘

every'h_ous‘e"._ It is usually the Portier (superintend,-'5

en't). ‘Whenever a stranger visits, "the next‘ daythe A _‘

soldiers come and ask questions Who~was_ ‘it?;
Why were "they here?; Wha_t‘did they want".’4;'f‘Were
they relatives?. I would like to send _}gre_etings;
But no, it causes too muchtrouble for thern.“

Map Main-

I also traced a small maptfrom the  N. repo1't i

on the "Hungarian problem to take with are. If I
could find the time, In vwould‘ try to retrace the
steps of the‘ revolutionists and see the imfportant
landmarks involved. ' x __ _ V V

I, struck up a conversation" with an:elde1_‘_ly
woman seated next tome. She had lived;in Hun-

gary before the war and was now returning for
a few days to stay with an aunt who was very ill.
‘There were four other girls also studying with the
I Oberlin College group in Vienna going to Buda-
pest with me. They sat in the rear and were en-
gaged in conversation’ with the rest of the Ameri-
can teenagers on our bus. Their chatter fre-
quently became too loud; and my partner and I
were quite annoyed by the obvious brashness of
so many American students traveling abroad.

Girl's Gall Dangerous .

I was becoming worried, slightly, because one
of the girls also had a map from the UN Report
and although I had mentioned that it was illegal
to take such a “marked” map into the area, she
was passing it back and forth to all who “cared-to
see. Having heard that punishment for being found

 

carrying a -marked map was jail, I ﬁnally men-

tioned my fears to my partner.---.~ *'

“I_’rn sure there’s ‘one’ from Budapest on the’

bus with us,” she ’replied,.“it could‘ be the lady
right behin__d you.” I was skeptical at ﬁrst, but
vaftericonsidering it quite carefully and realizing
that her words “You can’t trust anybody,” were
_’probably quite true,‘ I‘ decided to warn the girl
and be “safe’_"rather than sorry.
Later,‘at the border, I was barred from the bus
until “Customs Control” was -ﬁnished. ‘So I stood
and watched them se_arch everything. Nothing was
missed. Butnothing was said about‘, the tablecloth
I‘ was taking to ‘a‘friend’s relatives in the city...
The’ hour we ‘spent at the ‘border’ gave me
_ plenty of tin'i‘e_t'o menta'11y_digest’w'hat, was ,_v_.isible.

"It Goes On..."

. Ha-ar Come the Tigers! _
Joe Depelheur is a wide—eyed college football fanatic
who dies for Pitt despite the school's long-time crusade to

, dissuade him.

Joe is 30-years old now, a successful young executive

 the Alcoa chain, yet, he’s rather stand in the student
. section than sit in the v.i.p. box on the 50-yard line.

He loves college. So much, in fact, that he spent five

‘ .-years, apparently‘ working for the Gallop folks, attending
__,_three of America’s ﬁnest universities. ’

He went to Virginia, then Stanford, and, finally, Pitt.
He chose to embrace Pitt for the rest of his odd years -- and

"they have been just that.

Joe is a friend of Beano Cook’s. It that enough proof?
'I'l’i'ey.met at a party in their undergraduate days. They learn-’

t ed that Beano could sing most of the ﬁght songs of the
‘Eastern colleges, while Joe harmonized the Western cries..

Ever since they've been as close as‘ stitches on a
football. Especially ‘since Joe owns an apartment in
New 'York — Beano’s immortal City of ‘Oz -- which
makes ‘Jack Lemmon’s celluloid product look like a kind- '
ergarten. A U

Beano and Joe meet many times during the fall. Perhaps

‘ at Miami Beach, on the Western plains, on a Southwest sand
“dune, in the Okies, or wherever college football is being

played in the land.

When together, they often dine in restaurants whose
silverware could make the fabled greasy spoon look like-
_the Queen’s jewels, and talk, eat, and sing football. They
were once thrown out of an Oakland restaurant — at the
age of 26 — for singing:

Hail to the Lion, Loyal and True.
Hail Alma Mater, withvyour White and Blue.

Penn State forever, Moulder of Queers (Men, originally)
Fight for her honor, Fight and Victory again.

. I met Joe last year on the eve of the Syracuse football,
game. I pushed back the door of room 709 in the'Hotel
Syracuse at 3 a.m. I just fellinto my bed.

Boffom Dropped Out

It was the same kind of feeling that one gets when he
nonchalantly sits on a camode when someonehas failed to
place the seat back down. The top half of my double-mat-I
tress cot and a ﬁuffy pillow were missing.

I groped for the light switch. There sleeping on the

iﬂoor between my bed and Beano’s, on one of my mattresses,

his head on my pillow, was the shorts-clad body of Joe
Depelheur. _

After exchanging greetings and dimming the light
once again, I heard Joe turn to Beano and say, “If the
girls at college could see us now, Beano. Huh? We’ve
come a long way.”

Yes, Joehas come a long way. He comes a long way to
see Pitt play football -— anywhere. He’ll drive or take a
plane, but he’s there at kick-off.

On Saturday Joe was behind the wheel of a ’62 Chevro-
let, Beano was riding “shot gun,” and I was alone in the
rear seat. We weremotoring to University Park to see the
Penn State-Navy game at Beaver Stadium.

Sfafe Sarcasm

He was blustering with epitaths about the loss to Miami,
and praying that Navy would knock-off State. “I know so
many Penn State alumni,” he exclaimed. “And do I hear it
from them about our football team.

“I’m supposed to meet some of them at the end of the
game today and just once I'd like to give them the razzin’. I
get sick of being on the defensive side.”

“Imagine us without a line,” he cried. “A Pitt football
team without a line is like having a Sinatra record without a
stereo.

“Beano and I used to holler about (Ken) Montanari
and (Bill) Linder and those other guys,” he added. “Why
hell we didn't realize how tough they were till now.”

This sort of conversation split the air for hours until we
finally started seeing the cows grazing about the pasture,
and the silos jutting skyward, and realized that we were at
Penn State.

Driving from the game Joe just kept muttering
again and again how great Penn State is. Then we stop-
ped at a road-side tavern and watched the second half
of the USC - Duke game on television.

Joe became thoroughly incensed at some hayseed ‘char-
acters there who insisted upon hooting and howling about
their dart and pool games while a college football game
was in play.

After leaving there we drove just a short while before
Joe stopped the car. He got out and pulled the car antenna
to a height of a two-story home and then drove on. .

Between static and harsh clips of music we heard parts
of the Alabama-Georgia game, the LSU-Texas A&M game,
Texas against Oregon, Florida State and Kentucky, and a
Virginia high school game’ involving a team called Patrick
Henry High. . -

F rosh’ Booter
Standout In
Many Fields

James Cuddy, a freshman
booter, from Parkersburg,

West Va. is making a tre-»

mendous impression on both
soccer coaches Leo Bemis and

. Bob McNulty.

Cuddy is a scholarship-holder
who is really living up to his pro-
mise. Jim’s coach highly- recom-
mended him, calling him “th e
most outstanding high school ath-
lete I’ve ever had.”

At six feet, 175 pounds, he has
good size and is still growing. He
was also captain, second leading

. scorer, and playmaker of his high

school basketball team.

Skilled Performer
Cuddy’s activities weren’t only
conﬁned to the realm of sports.
At Parkersburg _High School, he
was presi_dent of his senior class
and had the lead in his class play.

Jim's only trouble in High
school was that he wasn’t seri-
ous .enough_ about ‘his studies.
However, as Coach Bemis put it,
“Cuddy has the ability to excel

A in both academic andathletic

activities.- If he puts, out that

little bit extra hecould become V
a ﬁne student and one of the. -

best soccer players Pitt has had’
in many years.”

Jim’s coach wanted him to at-

tend West Chester State, which is E

noted for ﬁne soccer teams, but
all they offer there is education.
His interest is in‘ medicine, ‘so he
chose the University of Pitts-
burgh. ‘

Jim, Dominic Mollilo, George
Sommers, and Chester Bonavitz
should be some of the better play-
ers on the frosh team this year.

These impressive f re s h In e n
should help new “coach ‘ Bob‘ _Mc-

Nulty ﬁeld a highly respectable ‘

team this year, according to
Coach Bemis.

WRITE? YOU’ RE WRONG

In the recent furor over the assassination of President McKinley,

it may have escaped your notice that a. nationwide study of the

writing ability of American college students has just been
I’ published. ~ .

The survey reveals an astonishing fact: that when students
have completed their freshman year and are no longer required
to take English, theirwriting skill progressively declines until
We come to the fantastic situation where graduating seniors
actually are poorer writers of English than irwoming freshmen!

Many theories have been oiiered to account for this incredible -
fact. Some say that seniors know less English than freshmen
because all seniors major in French. This is not true. No more
than 94 percent of seniors major in French. How about the
other six percent?

Well sir, of the other six percent, half—or three percent-—
take physics, and it is not hard to understand how these poor
souls grow rusty in English when all they ever say is “E equals .
MC squared.” _ '

Of the remaining three percent, two—thirds—or two percent--
major in whaling, and their English too grows feeble with
disuse. Whalers, as we all know,-do not speak at all except to
shout, “Thar she blows!” maybe twice a year.

Of the one percent remaining, it cannot be fairly said that 1,

-they are poor writers. The fact is, we don’t know what kind of
writers they are. Why not? Because they never write. And why
don’t they ever write? Because this remaining one percent 0
American college students are enrolled at the University of
Alaska, and never take their mittens off. ’

(Incidentally, I received quite a. surprise upon ﬁrst visiting
Alaska two years ago when I was invited to Juneau to crown

 

the Queen of the Annual Date Palm Festival." Frankly I ex-

 

pected to ﬁnd a surly and morose populace. After all, going‘
through life with your mittens on all the time is hardly calcu-
lated to make you merry as a cricket. Not only can't you Write,
but you miss out on all kinds of other fun things-—like three
card monte, making shadow pictures on the wall, and lint pick-
ing. However, to my astonishment, I discovered Alaskans to
be a hale and gregarious group, mittens notwithstanding, and
I soon found out why: because mittens notwithstanding, they
could still smoke Marlboro Cigarettes, still enjoy that rich
mellow ﬂavor, that ﬁne, clean Selectrate ﬁlter, that truly soft
soft pack, that truly flip-top ﬂip-top box—-and that, friends,
will make anybody happy, mittens notwithstanding. In fact,
Alaskans are the happiest people I have ever met in the Whole
United States—except, of course, for the Alaskan vendors of
Marlboro Cigarettes, who have not been paid in many years-
indeed, never——because how can anybody dig out coins to pay
for cigarettes when he is wearing mittens?) .
But I digress. What are we going to do about this deplorable
condition where college students, having completed Freshman
English, become steadily less proﬁcient in the use ofthe lan-
guage? The answer is simple. We will make them take Fresh-
man English all through college. In fact, we won’t let them take
anything else! This solution, besides producing a nation of ,
graceful writers, will also solve another harrowing problem:
where to park on campus. If everybody takes nothing but
Freshman English, we can tear down all the schools of law,
medicine, engineering, and Whaling, and turn them into parking
lots. Can’t we? to me: Me»: shunne-

The makers of Marlboro, who sponsor this column, plead
guilty to being among those Americans whose writing skill
is not all it might be. However, we like to think that_ac
tobacconists we know a thing or two. Won’t you try us and
see if you agree? .
