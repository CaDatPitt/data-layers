Fraternity Men Take On

Key Posts In IF Council

By MILLARD AMDUR
The Council of Fraternity Presidents slated various
fraternity men for key positions in IF Council elections held
at the Delta Sigma Phi house, March 6. The CFP, which

promises to become an inﬂuential‘!
pressure group delegated David
Bender, Col. ’57, to present the
slate and at the same time an ex-
planation ofiCFP’s stand in poli-
tics in IF. ’

The CFP had discussed the
elimination of party- politics; as
a necessary constructive meas-
.ure in the formation of a uni-
ﬁed revitalized fraternity sys-
tem. Members of the organiza-
tion discussed qualiﬁcations of
various candidates and selected
those whom they believed were
the best qualiﬁed nominees.

Bert O’Malley, Col. ’59, was
elected president; Dennis Licht-
man, Col. ’59, vice-president; John
Benford, Col. ’58,’ secretary; Roger
Anderson, Col. ’59; and Bob Tuck-
er, Col. ’58, ﬁfth man.

The new president, O’Malley is
treasurer of SC and vice-president
of Pi Kappa Alpha. A pre-med
student, he carries a 2.7 average.

The vice-presidential victor is
also an active fraternity man.
He is president of Theta Chi
and a mmeber of Men’s Debate
Association. His QPA is 2.5.

Adviser to IF, Don Milletary,
stated that the S-A-awardee would
./probably be selected within the
‘next two weeks. He is “enthused

‘ and convinced that theyoung men

elected to office will perform‘ their

duties. well.”

Spring Festival Theme Choselig
‘Modernize The Met’ Idea Used,

Vagnozzi Named as Chairman

“Modernize The Met?’ has been selected as the theme for
this year’s Spring Festival, which is scheduled for May 14-18.
Headed by Carole Vagnozzi, Ed. ’57, Festival will again

feature four nights of Carnival shows and booths and the

“Metropolitan Ball” on Saturday night, May 18. The Car-

Sweepstakes and Women’s Derby;
V will be run on Wednesday with

the theme of “Classy Chassis.” The

 Special Event and Women’s _Olym-
E pics, which were held last year,
V have been excludedifrom the com-

ing Festival. ‘
Reduction of Events
According to Carole, “The re-
duction of events will serve a good

purpose. What we do‘ have we’d

‘f like to have done well, instead of

having a number of things that

. aer done poorly and for which the
‘ students sacriﬁce school work.”

Business manager of the Fes-
tival is John Spear, Bus. Ad. ’60,
and Alan Burckin, Col. ’57, is
head of publicity. e

Deadline for show entries for
Carnival is this Thursday at _2:30
p.m. The fee, which is $60 plus "$15
tax, must accompany the entry.

Among the operas that have
been suggested for shows are
“La Boheme,” “Barber of Se-
ville,” “Marriage of Figaro,"
“Pagliacci,” “La Traviata,” “Bar-
tered Bride,” and “Carmen.”

The deadline for booths is April
4, at which time a $30 fee must
be paid. The ticket prices for Car-
nival will probably be the same
as in 1956, 30 cents, to enter the

 

grounds and 25 “cents for each.

‘show. Booth. prices will ‘be deter-

Chairman of Carnival is Don
Compton‘. Bus. Ad.‘ ’57. John Ben-
ford, Col. ’58, is the business man-
ager, and Murray Chass, Col. ’60,
is publicity chairman. _ '

This trio, along with the Festi-

val heads, is looking forward to

an increase in attendance this year.
If there is such an increase the
total attendance mark would stand
a good chance of passing the all-
time attendance which is about
12,000. Last year 10,514 people vis-
ited the Carnival grounds.

Herb Blitzstein, Col. ’60, is in
charge of dance arrangements.
The plans for the big affair are
not complete, but a nationally-
known band is being acquired
for the ﬁnale of Festival. Other

You will probably have more companies .to

many more than the men who collected their sheep-

today there are more good opportunities than there

At long last

After years of discussion, criticism and possible solu-
- tions offeredby Tuck Shop speculators, someone has ﬁnally
done something positive toward the reorganization of stu-
p dent government at the University.
’  The committee of faculty, alumni, and
-ed last year has proposed to Student Congress a plan for
the fundamental revamping of the organization of all stu-
dent governing bodies. .
, Under the new plan, government is consolidated and
centralized. The areas of control are clearly divided and
separated. This has always been the crying need of stu-

‘ dent government and at last it has been realized, at least‘

in theory.

The present proposal is by no means complete as it now
-stands. but it is a strong start. It should serve the func-
tion of .at least insuring the student body that steps are
“beirig taken now at the top to provide a much improved

method of government.‘

Using the results of an exhaustive study of student
governments across the country as a basis for working, the

“committee combined andcompromised to present an idea
of reform which best suits the situation at Pitt.

The committee is trying to prevent the duplication of
effort and the overlapping of control which presently plagues
the student government agencies. «They have tried to ﬁnd
a way of ﬁtting legislative power in the hands of the most
responsible officials. They have attempted to represent all
students and all areas of student life, present and proposed.

It cannot be said that the committee has succeeded in
solving the problem of reform but it is obvious that they
are working in the right direction. They have proven that

theyrecognize the major problems and can foresee the prac-
tical solutions.

llhfinisltetl Story ﬂ 

In thelast edition of the Pitt News, medals were recom-
mended for those who worked forrthe free inoculation
program at the University. The story, however, was not
ﬁnished, ' ,

Without a doubt, a medal should go to Lowell Tarbett,
Engr. ’57, and student chairman of the polio committee.

Tarbett handled a responsible position with ease and capa- ,

bility. He represented the student body to the administra-
tion and faculty in an admirable manner which showed

G qualities of leadership and perseverence.

All those students who worked with Tarbett on the
committee and proved themselves as leaders in the cam-
paign also deserve credit for their work.

The story is still not ﬁnished in another way. ‘The
second shots are to be administered at the end of this

; month. Most of the hard work that went into the distribu-

tion of the ﬁrst inoculations must be repeated.

" Probably the same people will be doing, many of the

A A One -Or

Governing Bodies

 

Both? . . .. A 

By Millard Amdur

Student Congress and Men’s Council are -‘now
formulating plans for drastic changes in their or-
ganizations. As recent articles in the Pitt News
have evidenced, the two plans submitted are in
many ways at odds with each other.

The MC plan, encompassing three phases of
government, legislative, executive, and judicial,
provides for a separate program
for men’s government and the
all-male organization.

The SC plan, although more
in formative, amorphous stage
than that of MC, provides for
one group governing the whole
university. The representatives,
on the University of Pittsburgh
Student Government Association
would have no vote in any of  ~ .-
the other groups represented on the UPSGA.
Would Be Limit-ed .

Since the presidents of the schools as well as
the ‘living units (including residents, non-residents,
IF and Panhel would be represented, MC and
WSGA would be limited under this program to
merely represent men’s and women’s segregated
activity interests.- That both these programs" can-
not function concurrently is obvious. Which one
should go into effect? Should either go into effect?

The objectives of the two groupsare not as
‘sharply variant as the methods —~of implementa-
tion. Both wish to promote a stronger, more
meaningful student government on campus. They
agree that the status quo is far from adequate.‘

Out Of Commission -

They do not concur on twovbasic issues. First.
of all, the problem of conflicting authority and
duplication exists.

sented on which governmental body.
Careful Consideration

Careful consideration is a necessity at this time 

in our evolving university. A program of student}
government is not for one year, nor for two, but“,_,
rather for an indefinite period of time.
for its own sake is not the answer.

A constitution for MC is presently in the mak-‘‘’
ing. Itris to be ratified at a meeting, Wednesday,

March 13, embodying the fundamental structures '

outlined previously. This in other words will af-
fect the student body at the coming spring elec-
tion. '

There are many reasons to more closely con-
sider such a fundamental change before its institu-
tion. The UPSGA plans which will not be complete
until next year could not go into effect without reor-
ganizing, next year, the reorganized Men’s Council.
This would serve no purpose and be completely
foolhardy.

MC members and all government representa-

Atives must come to the realization that what they

-are doing can either be an all—important,service
to the university of the future or a complete farce
in the university of the present.

The non—ﬁctional Interfraternity—Council too
might well heed this truth. The new officers must
also come to the fore in this group with a con-
structive program that will be lasting or fall by
the wayside in stagnation. Change, ‘yes; change,
per se, no. P

that “dig the sounds” but don’t

are at least thought of when the
time comes for the student to
choose a location for an eve-

TWO CANLIVE 4:
AS C.HI:‘.ESlLY AS ONE

Now in the final months of the school year, one thing
is certain: you and your roommate are not speaking.

But it is not too late to patch things up. Examine the
rift calmly. Search your soul with patience. Perhaps
the fault is yours. Perhaps you are guilty of violating
some of the basic rules of roommate etiquette. V

CASUAL WEAR

 
 
  

For instance, in decorating your room, have you
forced your preferences on your roommate without.re-
gard to his or her tastes? This is a common cause of
friction. Indeed, it once happened to me back in my fresh-

. man year when I was sharing a room with a boy named
Rimsky Sigafoos who covered every inch of our Wall
with 850 pictures of James Dean. '

“Rimsky,” I said to him in gentle reproof, “please
don’t think me unduly, but I had hoped to put a picture
of my ﬁancee Mary Beth Thermidor on the wall.”

Rimsky examined the picture of my ﬁancée Mary Beth
Thermidor. “You’re kidding, of course,” he said and
dropped the picture in the wastebasket.

Well, that got my dander up, and I was mad as a Wet
hen till Rimsky gave me a Philip Morris Cigarette.

As we all know, there is nothing like a mild, natural,
Philip Morris. Treats a man right. ‘No ﬁlter, no foolin’!
Anger melts and frowns become smiles with Philip
Morris, all seems right in the world, and no man’s hand
is turned against you, nor yours against any man.

So, puffing a pacifying Philip Morris, I forgot all
about Rimsky’s slight to Mary Beth Thermidor. _In fact,
with her picture out of sight, I soon forgot all about_
Mary Beth Thermidor, too, and one night at the Fresh-
man Frolic, spying a round young coed over in a corner,
I came up to her and said with a fetching leer, “Excuse
me, miss. We don't know each other, but I would like
to rectify that sad omission.” ,And she said, “Oh, you
horrid, horrid youth! I am your ﬁancée Mary Beth

, Thermidor.” With that she stomped furiously away, and

P though I tried to win her back with Philip Morrises, she
was beyond recall. I, utterly shattered, signed on as a
cabin boy with the Cunard Line and am today, aged 53,
the oldest cabin boy on the North Atlantic run.

High - Scoring Morehead‘

Presents Initial Hurdle

 

 

 

By ED KOLTISKA

Eleven players, one manager, and two coaches ﬂy to
Columbus, 0., this afternoon for their scheduled NCAA tilt
against Morehead State College tomorrow evening at the
Ohio State Field House starting at 7:30 p.m. ..

This will be the ﬁrst round of NCAA competition for
the Jungle Cats as they open up the doubleheader with the

Miami of Ohio in the nightcap.

Coach Bob Timmons has carded
a practice session for this evening
to help the squad get acquainted
with the floor. After the ‘practice
session the traveling squad will be
quartered at the Deshler-Hilton
Hotel.

Hamilton Elated
Athletic Director Tom Hamilton
willvaccompany the team to the

* >1: 3!:

ﬁrst round game of the NCAA
tourney at Columbus.

Hamilton, very happy about
the invitation, said, “The team
proved themselves this season.
They played a strong schedule
and it is very gratifying to see
them record a 15-9 mark against
some of the top teams in the
country.”

“I believe they have shown the
ability to play with the best of
them and will certainly give a
good account of themselves in the
playoffs.”

' Eagles Stress Offense

When the opening buzzer sounds
tomorrow evening, the Oaklanders
will ﬁnd themselves against a team
that tied Tennessee Tech and
Western Kentucky State for the

‘ lead in the Ohio Valley Confer-

ence with a 17-10 record.
Although last year’s won and
lost slate of the Eagles isn’t too
impressive, nevertheless they led
the nation in total team offense
by averaging 95.9.points per
game. I
This year Morehead has con-
tinued their high scoring. They
have been averaging more than
90 points a game in chalking up a
19-7 record.
Very Tall Team
Coach Bill_ Laughlin, in his
fourth year at Morehead State,
has directed his team to 68 wins
against 3_4 losses. This will be
Laughlin’s second attempt in the
NCAA. Last year the Eagles de-
feated Marshall, 107-92, but lost
to Iowa, 97-83, in the. second
round of NCAA competition —- a

similar fate suffered by the Pan-

thers in their last tourney in 1941.
A Coach Timmons’ hoopsters will
face a lineup that averages 6-5
in height. The tallest man on
the Eagle squad is Jim Shimfes-
sel, a 6-9 center. “Although not
a high scorer, Shimfessel is an
excellent rebounder who is very
hard to move under the basket.
Once he gets his position, he
holds it,” said Coach Laughlin.
Steve Hamilton, 6-8, and Dave
Keleher, 6-7, will start at the for-
ward positions. Hamilton, a hold-
over from last year, is the leading
scorer for the Kentuckians, aver-
aging more than 24 points a game.
Carroll Injured
Two of the smallest men onthe
Blue and Gold quintet ‘are Kim
Thompson, 6-1, and Harlan Tolle,

5-10. Tolle is the second leading g

scorer on the Mountaineer squad,
averaging 18 points a contest.
The sixth man for the lien-

 

tuckians will be Gene Carroll,
who sizes up at 6-4. Carroll,

played half of every game for
thc Eagles. Recently Carroll in-
jured his knee which may side-
line him for the Panther tilt.

Coach Timmons will go with
his usual starting lineup with the
probable exception of Bob Lazor.
The past few days that Lazor has
donned basketball togs for light
workouts has found him unable to
put too much pressure on his left
knee. I

Hennon Needs Two

If Lazor is still nursing his in-
jury tomorrow «night, Timmons
will start Barry Brautigam in his
place. ' _

Leading the Oaklanders in scor-
ing is sophomore Don Hennon.
Hennon will have an opportunity

Panther history to break the 500
mark in one season of competition.
The other player was Ed Pavlick
who scored 622 points in 26 games
in the 1954-55 season.

Hennon, who made the ﬁrst
string of the Small All-America
selections, has scored 498 points
in’ 24 regular season games.

, The rest of ‘the starting array
will consist of John Riser, Chuck
Hursh, and Jules Pegeus. Pegeus
has been bothered by an old heel
injury in the past week but is
expected to be ready for action
against Morehead tomorrow.

Darling Paces
Seep of Rings
At Cym Classic

By DAVID BREAKSTONE

Tom Darling, Pitt’s proof
that good things come in
pocket-size packages, turned
in a king-size performance on
the ﬂying rings at the Eastern
Intercollegiate Gymnastics

League championships at Syra-
cuse, Saturday night, and walked
off with the ﬁrst-place trophy.
With his precision display of aer-
ial acrobatics, Darling became the
ﬁrst individual Eastern champ in
the Panthers’ three years of in-
tercollegiate gymnastics competi-
tion.

The Philadelphia junior’s total
of 277 points on his ﬁnal effort
was second highest of the meet in
any event. However, Pitt’s other
two aerialists, Dave Hirst and Jack
Hammond, were not to be out
done by their stellar teammate.
Accordingly, their routines earned
second and third places and pro-
vided the Panthers ‘with the only
one-two-three sweep of the cham-
pionships. '

Coach Warren Neiger was

rings trio as he, said, “They real-

tMoreI1ead Coach ;
Jittery About Pitt 

By STEVE BUTCHOCK
Sports Editor

 

 

Morehead’s coach Bob Laughlin, speaking with a typi-

. cal southern drawl which was all the more becoming over

the telephone, appeared a little nervous at the thought of
having to play Coach Bob Timmons’ ﬂoormen in the district
opening round of the NCAA basketball tournament tomor-

. row evening. Why Laughlin should display such nervous-

 could spell success or ruination of

standing as Vega capitalized on

”’a fifth. “Quite all right and quite

ness is not determinable, except maybe he is still trying to recover
from "the regular season jitters. ' p

The Kentuckians have completed their fourth campaign under
Laughlin. His cagers have compiled 68 wins, 34 setbacks during
this time. The current record is 19-7 with games against such
formidable foes as Louisville, Cincinnati, Western Kentucky, and St.
Bonaventure. I I p

“I don’t know what my starting lineup will be when we I
play Pitt, said the Morehead coach. It’s still almost a week
(this was last Thursday) until the game. However, I can give
you a probable starting lineup. Why we have already lost
guard Gene Carroll with a leg injury. He usually plays about
half of the game, too, alternating with Harlon Tolle (5-10) and
Kim Thompson (6-1) at the guard spots.” ,

The more I talked to Coach Laughlin the more pessimistiehe
sounded. He said that he did not have a good inside man or ‘a
sharp outside shooter. tHe didn’t seem to” know whether his boys
would play possession ball or start gunning from the opening tipoff.
Concerning the fast break he offered, “If the opportunity presents

Also in contrast to last. year
were the total places other than
ﬁrsts taken . by the Panthers.
Whereas they received points for
19 other places in 1956, they had
only seven "ﬁnishers besides the
winners.

Team captain White, who was
runner-up in both longdistance
freestyle events last year, fell
back to third in the 220- and
440- yard freestyles. His ‘220’
time of 2:25.4 was more than
ﬁve seconds slower than his 1956
mark.

Don Weber, a junior,.was an-
disappointment to the
Panther cause. ‘Weber picked up
just one’ point with a sixth — the
200—yard backstroke.

The locals got some important
help from divers Milo Fischer and
Burt Marks, who brought in ten
points between them. Fischer took
a second in the high board diving

while Marks, in his last meet,
placed third in the latter.

When questioned about the be-
low average performance of some
of his swimmers, Grady declined
to comment, only saying that they
did as well as could be expected
under the conditions. What “con-

itself we will use the fast break. But you never know‘ what’s going
to happen.” "

Eventually the conversation
had to reach the focal point of
Pitt basketball—-Don Hennon. “I
understand he is an awfully good
ball player,” said the Kentucky
”mentor reverently. “But I’m go-
ing to tell you one thing. If he
plays as well against ‘us as ‘Dar-
rell Floyd did last year when he
scored 65 points, the Lord help
us.” Then he took a deep breath
and exhaled into the mouthpiece.

It resembled one of those
snappy Kentucky tornadoes be-.
ginning to generate force for
its ‘destructive, meanderous
journey through the bluegrass.

He was probably thinking of Co-

lumbus and Pitt, or perhaps the
shuttering thought of having
to meet Coach Adolph Runp’s
Kentucky Wildcats on their
, home ﬂoor at Lexington in the
regional ﬁnale if they beat Pitt.

If you have any doubts about
the Bluegrassers not showing for
the game tomorrow, cast them
aside. They may make more noise
on the scoreboard than the Pan-
thers. In fact they could easily
beat the Jungle Cats who are de- ,
cidedly at a height disadvantage.

The one thing, though, that

the locals advancing to the sec-
ond round would be the season
pattern of having a “hot” or “cold”
shooting night. ‘
Coach Timmons’ quintet has
been unpredictable all season.
They take the court with the out-
come of the game reﬂected by
a very good shooting display or
a very bad one. They seldom
experience an average night. Let’s "
hope they’re hot at Columbus.

the parallel and high—bars. _

In _tumbling, Hammond com-
bined with Hirst to take third and
fourth places. Their eﬁorts were
ﬁne in a particularly strong ﬁeld.

Dave Ruber scaled the rope
in four seconds ﬂat which was
good enough for a fourth place
award. For the information of
rope climb connoisseurs, the
‘winning time was a cool 3.4 sec-
onds by one Paul Dean of Army!
Jim Mulvihill, another local
hope, had a tough break on the
high bar and was thus disquali-
ﬂed.

All told, the Blue and Gold
acrobats garnered one ﬁrst, one
second, one third, two fourths and

commendable,” in the expert opin- ,
ion of Coach Neiger. I

Jim Walker asks:

Can a mechanical engineer make real progress in a chemical firm?

‘I soon learned that the success of a Iargescale

chemical process hinges importantly on mechanical
equipment. And the success of this equipment-—especially for a new process
-depends on (1) Research, (2) Development, (3) Plant Engineering, and
(4) Close Supervision. The net result is that a mechanical engineer at Du Pont
can progress along any one of these four broad highways to a top-level position.

My own Du Pont experience includes mechanical engineering work in
ﬁelds as varied as atomic energy, fabrics and finishes, and nylon manufacture.
Every one of these brought with it a new set of challenging problems in con-
struction, instrumentation and power supply. And every one provided the
sort of opportunities a man gets in a pioneering industry.

So, to answer your question, Jim, a mechanical engineer certainly has
plenty of chances to get somewhere with a chemical company like DuPont.

H. M. Pickering, .Ir., received a BS. in ME. and BE. from the University of Minnesota in
1940. He gained valuable technical experience at Hanford Works, intRichland, Wash.,
Hand in Du Pont’s Fabrics and Finishes Plant" at Parlin, N. I. Toda
Manager at Du Pont’s_ Seaford,iDel., plant, where nylon is made.

 

y, he is Assistant Plant

“Pick” Pickering answers:

You might call that a leading question, Jim, but the
answer leads right into my bailiwick. I came to.
Du Pont in l940, after taking a combined mechanical
and electrical engineering course. So I had what you
might call \a double reason for ‘wondering about my
future with a chemical ﬁrm.

WANT TO KNOW

James B. Walker received his BS. in mechani-
cal engineering from North Carolina State
College in June,‘ 1954, and was working to-
ward his M.S. in the same ﬁeld when he was
called for military service.
