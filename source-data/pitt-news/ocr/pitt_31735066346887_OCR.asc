22 Hospitals Join
‘Operation Prep Pitt’
By VIJAY JAIN

“Operation Prep Pitt V..,”
the fifth annual medica1—civil
defense drill for Allegheny
County was conducted last
Friday, and Saturday. The

drill is conducted to test and

prepare the civil defense personnel
and hospitals for emergencies re-
sulting from any national disaster.

The program is sponsored by
the office of Civil Defense for

Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, _

Hospital Council of Western Penn-
sylvania, Allegheny County Medic-
al Society and Health Department,
and the University Schools of the
Health Professions. «

This year about 9.2 hospitals
took part in the program. An add-
ed feature this year was the ex-
tension of the scheme to cover the
county and city airports. This test-
ed the alertness of the airport
officials to cope with the situation;
only La Guardiaiairport in New
York has a comparable program
for the airports.

Approximateiy 100 p e r s o n s,
ranging from volunteer nurses to
Boy Scouts, were made up in the
Civic Arena to act as casualties,
and were sent by convoy to the
participating hospitals. H e r e the
“patients” were separated accord-
ing to the nature of their wounds

and sent to the appropriate ward. M

Some serious cases. were up-
erated upon and others “landed
in the morgue.” After the drills
patients were released and al-

‘ lowed to go home. A large num- i

ber of people watched the dis-«
plays put up by various agencies
for the occasion. The displays"
showed blood bank, x-ray, water
and air puriﬁcation, shelter.

A helicopter surveyed the area
to see that everything was pro-
ceeding smoothly. On,Friday, a
symposium on injuryand its treat-
ment was conducted for the ofﬁ
cials. ‘

Grads to Help Deaf  

The University is seeking ten outstanding college grad-
uates who will return to. the school this fall and undertake
special training to become teachers of the deaf. All expenses
will be paid for the selected applicants from a grant received
by the University from the Federal Government.

The crash training program is being irnplimented through

a $3,000,000
signed last October by President
Kennedy. The ‘University is‘ one
of 38 institutions of higher_learn-
ing chosen to receive funds from
the assigned amount.

“The University has one of the
nation’s leading departments in
special education and rehabilita-
tion and has close working ties
with the Western Pennsylvania
School for the Deaf. The graduate
program under-taken will help
break the sound barrier for 8,000
deaf children of the nation who,
because they lack specially train-
ed teachers, are without ability to
communicate,” according to Dr.
Jack Birch, chairman of special
education and rehabilitation.

Federal Aid

The Federal aid is being allocat-
ed in the form of graduate fel-
lowships and faculty support to
the institutions. The University
ranked seventh in the amount of
fellowship assistance granted by
the US. Office of Education and
third in the amount of aid to the
faculty, whose teaching schedules
are being extended for the .pro-
gram.

Dr. Birch ‘and Dr. Sam B.
Craig, superintendent of the
School for the%Deaf located on
East Swissvale Avenue, have
launched a campaign to find the
candidates. Dr. Craig will co-
ordinate the program.

The program was very sensibly
drawn,” Dr. Craig commented. “It
gives qualiﬁed people every en-
couragement to undertake the ad-

ditional eight months of training

and enter this rewarding ﬁeld.”
The encouragements are: a
graduate fellowship covering all
tuition, an additional $2,000 sti-
pend, and —— as administered here
—-even room and board at the
qualifying to supervise and pro-
School for the Deaf. The students
(Continued on Page 8)

will receive a certiﬁcate of com-
pletion at its termination. Appli-
cants must have a high-school
diploma and “possession of the
maturity and_ the ability to un-
dertake the necessary studies and
clinical experiences of a full work
week.” The trainees’ costs will be
$500 for tuition, plusuniforms and
books.

Chancellor Comments

The administration and faculty
havepexpressed their belief in the
need for training professional as-
s i s t a n t s. Chancellor Litchﬁeld
commented: “The shortage of per-
sons in many professional ﬁelds

. requires that the professional
be relieved of duties of a less ex-
acting nature . . . ”The Chancellor
added that the new programs could
create new job opportunities and
provide training for married wo-
men who want to re-enter the
labor market after raising their
children.

This will be the first program of
its type in Western Pennsylvania.
Upon completing the course, most
women willgwork with a private
dentist.

 ‘No God Exists, ’ Claims Scriven

 

Professor Discounts
 Religious Arguments

By BERNIE TRUMPOWER

“There is no God” claimed Pro-
fessor l\/Iichael Scriven as he
spoke at the first Midday Series of
the summer trimester last Wed-
nesday. A near capacity crowd of
interested students, curious clergy,
and questioning faculty gathered
to hear the philosopher, scientist
and atheist.

To prove there is no supreme
being, God or otherwise, Profes-
sor Scriven ﬁrst stated the ﬁfteen
used by the theologians sup-
porting theism. These fifteen
arguments varied from mere de-
ﬁnitions to the theological argu-

ment of the “prime mover,” or

that “things must. have come from
somewhere.”

“These ﬁfteen points are strong-

ly lacking,” stated Scriven as he
vwent on to define God to be “more
intelligent, more benevolent than

any other being,” and in addition,
“invisible and ubiquitous.” Using
this definition of God, Scriven at-
tempted to disprove theitheistic

arguments, basing his own argu-

ments on logic.

Strongly ' Doubts

“I strongly doubt if there are
any of you that still believe in
Santa Claus; even it your name
is Virginia,” remarked the pro-
fessor, trying to show the ridicul-
ousness of “being a believer.”

Refering to historical revela-

tions, Scriven satirizcd, “Either
God ﬁnds this method rather
unfavorable today, or we have
some highly inaccurate reports.”
Accounting for the fact that
people do still witness various
“miracles” he said, “'I‘rying~ to
ﬁnd valid proof for modern day
miracles is dismal business.”
In particular, he stated‘ that
many of the “miraculous cures”
are “psychosomatic.”

He compared people who “com-
municate” with those who “are in
touch with a dead uncle.”

Scriven used the concept of an
infinite series to disprove the
point that “The universe is so
magniﬁcent that there must have
been someone who arranged it.”
Claiming it is possible that “it
just happened by chance,” he
made the analogy of a gambler’s

odds at having twenty reds come
up in a consecutive series on a
roulette wheel at Reno.

Highly Improbable

“It is highly improbable, but
after so long it will happen,” he
stated. “The world had to turn
out some way, and this is the way
it turned out,” is Scriven’s ex-
planation of creation.

Professor Scriven pointed out
that there have been gods as long
as there have been men and posed
the question, “One thousand gods
have existed. The odds are 999 to
1 against your god being the right
one. How do you know you have

-picked the right one?”

Continuing his attack on the-
ological arguments, Scriven ac-
counted for the people who

have “experiences with God”
by saying, “If I had been given
ten thousand children when they
were ’ three years old to raise,
and had raised them in such an
environment, I would be rather
disapointed if a few of them
didn’t have some sort of experi-
ence.”

A larger than usual crowd at-
tended the iced tea hour at which
Scriven defended his beliefs. After
engaging in a stimulating discus-
sion with students that lasted well
over two hours, Professor Scriven
concluded that even if he had not
convinced everyone he was right,
he had at least succeeded where
many universities fail; he had
forced people to defend and con-
sider their own beliefs.

The Vﬁaiz Canvas

With two brush strokes the University has again broad-
ened the scope of its already wide panorama of educational
opportunity. Today’s simultaneous announcements of the
graduate program training teachers for the deaf and the
School of Dentistry’s new dental assistant curriculum carry
us a step further toward the multi-dimensional,cineramic
institutional vista envisaged by" our ‘Tomorrow the World’
planners. ’ '

Community and social benefits of the new programs
will prepare participants to make specific contributions to
mankind. By assuming some of the more routine and time-
consuming tasks of over—burdened dentists, the dental as-

sistant can offer conpetent and useful service to the wide

range of humanity possessing teeth.

A‘ narrower but more helpless group willbenefit from
the special program training teachers for the deaf. Through
a specially oriented programipersons can learn the challeng-
ing but rewarding technique of revealing the world to deaf
children.

But more immediate and pragmatic are some of the ,
' implications the additional fields have upon the University’s
. future. They are tangible, proof that it intends to assume

responsibility for the education of more and more useful
persons in more and more areas of society. That the two
new areas are specific‘ indicates dedication to the concept

i that the truly great institution must provide specialized as

Well as general education.
The Dental School’s innovation, of course points to the
still broader selection of curricula in X-ray technology, lab-

oratory technology and dental hygiene which they hope to V

offer in the near future. And even wider possibility, one
mentioned by Chancellor Litchfield, is that the University
may eventually begin to provide persons with technical _or
semi—professional training in other areas such as engineering.

The deaf teachers’ training program also adds depth V

and color to the canvas because it very heavily bears the
stamp of federal endorsement, a potential source of funds

. for other service aimed projects which the University may

eventually wish to enter.

The canvas is being unfurled further all the "time, new
paint is being applied even before the old dries; the Univer-
sity’s perspective may well produce ‘a totally new and great

educational masterpiece.

A More Civilized Way . . .

Two-Upmanship  

There was a British ﬁlm which made the rounds
not too long ago (within the memory of the aver-
age living sophomore). It was called “School for
Scoundrels” and was concerned with the trials of
young Palfrey (Ian Carmichael),Aa pitifully inept
fellow who suffers from ﬂabbi-
ness of the ego. .

Harassed and hu'milia.ted’..at
every turn by secretaries and
headwaiters, bamboozled and
swindled by two winsomely
wicked used-car salesmen, faced
with the possibility oflosing his
fuzzy-brained but beautiful girl
friend to his arch-rival (Terry
Thomas), whose ego is down-
right muscle-bound, poor Palfrey
enrolls in the -School for Scoun-
drels. There he is instructed in the art of “One-
Upmanship,”.the method by which any poor fool

' can make any other poor fool look even poorer.

Lesson Well Learni-

Palfrey learns his lessons well, for when he re-
turns to the world which once left his nerves in a
chronic state, all his erstwhile tormenters are now
mercilessly put one-down. The secretaries and
used.-car salesmen quake at his glance. The arch-
rival sputters (as only Terry Thomas can sputter)
in defeat as the dazzled girl -friend falls into Pal-
frey’s arms and ploys. ‘

It is unlikely that very many people have taken
One-Upmanship seriously enough toactually prac-
tice it the way Palfrey et al do. But the movie
(based on the book by‘ Stephen Potter_) is a rather
clever satire on the people to whom One-Upman-
ship would come naturally. -That is, people who

‘are content to put up a show of superiority without.

really achieving excellence or even better than;
averageness. Such are the students who bandy
the jargon about but don’t~concern themselves with
understanding the subject and the Palfreys of this
world who win tennis’ matches by practically strew-
ing the court with psychological banana peels.
Involves More Than Competence‘
One-Upmanship, of course, involves more than
just the appearance of competence. You have to
make the other guy feel lousy (one-down), whether
he deserves it or not. And since everyone is pretty
much in the same boat and/or rut to begin with,
he probably doesn’t. ‘ ' C
After the “Will-you—marry-me?” “Yes-yes—I’ll-
marry-you” scene, a tense moment’ comes when
Palfrey is exposed by the villainous rival and the
girl, one-down, is rightfully indignant at being
thusly played. At this point Palfrey pulls what
is perhaps the most subtle play of all -4 he repudi-

ates the teachings of his master and chucks the ' C

One-Upmanship book out the window, thereby in-
troducing a whole new school of ‘thought, namely,
that of Two-Upmanship. ' ,

Palfrey, really one-up but letting the girl think
she’s one-up, is two-up, and in the end, to the dis-
may of old master one-up, lets. love or a reasonable
facsimile thereof, conquer all. .

There are times, of course, when it is eminently
satisfying to deliver a good solid blow to someone
.else’s midsection, which on a social level is what
One-Upmanship involves. But it never helps much
and it’s not very sophisticated. Two-Upmanship
may not be as much fun, but it’s a bit more
civilized.

ence fiction through literary ef
forts of that type, he has pro-

bably decided that there is nothing worth while in

 

the field. This is like reading a Mickey Spillane

novel and condemning the field of mystery. Well-
written mystery /novels such as Du Maurier’s
Rebecca do exist. -

Some science fiction writers produce worth-

while material, too. Perhaps it is unfair to begin‘

with the man whom Christopher Isherwood con-
siders “a very great" and unusual talent,” but Ray
Bradbury is one of the links between science fic-
tion and the rest of contemporary literature. He
wrote the screenplay for the highly praised War-
ner Brothers production of “Moby Dick” and his
non-science fiction_col1ection'of related short stor-
ies, Dandelion“ Wine, was called “a’ work of rare
literary merit” in the Saturday Review.
Illuminofes Flows

Bradbury’s first effort, The Martian Chronicles,
used the exploration of Mars by Earthmen to il-
luminate the flaws in humanity. In one story, for

 example, the «whites in a small Southern townf
ggwere enraged.and. helpless when all the negroes
in the area decided to migrate to Mars. In all of

his writing the author exhibits a skill in word
choice that would make any non-science fiction
writer jealous. The “Chronicles” story “Ylla” be-
gins: S ' ,
They had a house of crystal pill-
ars on the planet Mars by the
edge of an empty sea, and every
morning you could see Mrs. K.eat-
ing the golden fruits that grew
from the crystal walls, or clean-
ing the house with handfuls of
magnetic dust, which, taking all
dirt with it, blew away on the
hot. wind. Afternoons . . . you

could see Mr. K. himself in ,his
room, reading from a metal book
with raised hieroglyphs over i
which he brushed his hand, as
one might play a harp. And from
the book, as his fingers stroked,
a voice sang, a soft ancient voice,
which told tales of when the sea
was red, steam on the shore and
ancient men had carried clouds
of metal insects and electric" spi-
ders into battle.

In 0119 Paragraph Bradburyconveys the age of
the, Martian civilization and prepares the reader
for the appearance of all-too-human characteristics
in the Martians. T

For ability to describe people through narra-
tion or the (reactions of others to them, Theodore
Sturgeon is the best example in the science fiction
realm. “The Pod in the Barrier,” from his collec-
ti0n, A Touch of Strange, follows Virginia, whose
complete lack of belief in anything ultimately al-
lows her to disarm a fission bomb by reading how
it works and characteristically believing that it
doesn’t. As one of her companions says:

You’d say, “Back” home, I’ve got
a silver-headed walking stick,”
and she’d say, “Yeah, you’ve got
a silver-headed walking stick,” in
that flat dull drone of hers, and,
by _damn, you’d. find yourself
arguing with her that you did
have one . . . .

Two of Many

Sturgeon’s novel," More than Human, begins:

‘The idiot lived in a black and
Hgray ‘world, punctuated by the
white lightning of hunger and the
flickering of fear. His clothes
were old and many windowed.
Here peeped a shinbone, sharp

as a cold chisel, and there in the

torn coat were ribs like the fing-

ers of a fist. He was tall and
flat. His eyes were calm and his

, face, was dead . . .
Sturgeon and Bradbury are only two of many

. science fiction writers who can handle the Eng-
lish language with a sharpness above that of the .

“Zap - you’-re paralyzed?’ type, of science fiction.
There are others. Like §Alfred Bester, who probed

mind reading and teleportation in two widely dis- ~~

cussed novels - The Demolished Man and The
Stars My Destination - they do not cut out human
beings of the cardboard variety to serve as’ back-

Diamondmen Rally To ConquerWV

NOT THE QUEEN MARY -— You don’t have to be aboard an ocean
liner to enjoy the pastime games on deck. Here are two Pitt students
playing outdoor shuffleboard in front of the Student Union porch.

Lions Bury

Cat Track
Team Fast

By JIM O'BRIEN

Mimic Rip (the hungry i)
Engle must have been along-
side the track. shouting en-
couragement to the Penn State
track team.

His best impersonation is one of
Nikita Khrushchev blaring, “We
will bury you X” 1

The blast is aimed at Pitt, and
his football team did everything
but shovel on the dirt earlier in
the fall. The track team did that
on Saturday in smashing the Pan-
ther thin--clads, 93 ‘/2 -371/2, at Uni-
versity Park.

First Win

The Lions, who had lost their
first two dual meets of the season,
handed the Panthers their third
loss this year against one victory.

Once again it was Joe~Friend
that salvaged some face for the
losers. He was Pitt’s only
double winner, capping the 120
yard high hurdl=.>s and the
broad jump. Friend also anchor-
ed the winning mile relay team,
and took a second in the 220
yard low hurdles.

,Meanwhile the Nittany Lions

were overhauling their record
books, establishing four 11 e w
marks in the high jump, pole

vault, half-mile and two-mile
runs. ‘
Sweep Events
They swept ﬁrst place in 12 of
the 15 events contested, and had
three double winners. Pitt had no
first place winners besides Friend.
In one of the best races of the
day, fleet-winged Vance Carter
pushed State’s Howie Deardorf
to a. record 1250.6 half-mile
clocking‘. The distance runs
were monopolized by the win-
ners as they took all sixgplaces
in the mile and two-mile runs.
In the ﬁeld sector they also
swept the javeiin event.
With a 56 point advantage Engle
must envy Coach Chick Werner.

Golfers Vie

In Eastern

The Panther golf team jour-
neyed to Ithica, New York
this past weekend to parti-
cipate in the Eastern Intercolle-
giate championships. The team
departed with hopes of pmaking
a more impressive showing at
Cornell than they have in dual
meet competition so far this sea-
son (0-7).

Team standouts Neil Short-
house and Dale -Long presented
the greatest threat to the East’s
finest golfers. Both have thus far
had disappointing seasons, but
tournament play may spark Pitt’s
best to their full potentialities.

Some of the veteran golfers
will remember a very exciting
finish to this same tournament
one year ago. It took a final
round of 19 holes to decide the
number one position. Panther
golfer Ron Dermitt had to settle
for the runner—up‘ position, but
not until he established himself
as the tournamcnt’s most im-
proved player.

With good rounds of golf from
Shorthouse and Long, Pitt may
be able to show the other teams

I of this area that dual match rec-

ords are no indication of the
Panthers’ capabilities.

Duqilesne Nine

The publicity *man for the
Greater Pittsburgh Slo-Pitch Soft-
ball League says that Duquesne
will beat Pitt’s baseball team to-
morrow.

Radio Richie, the famed right
arm of Joe Tucker, reports that
Duquesne has a formidable team,
and nothing that this school can
muster will beat it.

‘‘You’ll see,” he voted, “yous
guys don’t stand a chance. If you
have one good pitcher, Duquesne
has three. Pitt doesn’t beat Du-
quesne in nothing.”

This is what a Pitt fan has to
listen to all year.

.W&J Crushed

16-0; Meet

Duquesne Next

By BOB SMIZIK

Two_ games against Duquesne
and Penn State each make this
week the make-or-break part of
the season for the Panther base-
ball team. After scoring two im-
pressive triumphs last week the
Cats are now contenders for the
NCAA district play-offs, but must
take at least three out of four
of these tough games to make
the tourney.

The Mitters scored their fifth

an d sixth straight wins over
Washington & Jefferson and West
Virginia last week to boost their
collegiate record to 8-4.

West Virginia, seeking revenge

‘for the 2-0 loss they suffered at

the hands of the Cats earlier in
the season, appeared to be a
winner going into. the ninth in-
ning with " a. 3-1 lead on Satur-
day. °
Martha Stars

With one man out in the Pitt
ninth, Ron Supansic singled for
his third hit of the game and

was sent to third by Drew Wil-

liamson’s single. A f t e r Corky


The
Dukes

Cuthbert flied out, Al Riccuiti
walked to set the stage for Paul
Martha’s herioics. A
The football ace sent previ-
ously unbeaten Tom‘ Shafer’s
first pitch deep into the left-
center ﬁeld gap for a bases
clearing double to send the Cats
into the lead.

Before the ninth Shafer had
kept the Panthers fairly well in
check, limiting them to only three
hits. One of the hits was a pro-
digious home run blast by pitcher
Jim Sylvis over the rightlfield
‘fence, 360 feet away.

Surprise Starter

The appearance of Sylvis on
the mound was somewhat of a
surprise, especially to the Moun-
taineers. They had been expect-
ing John Carlisle, who had shut
them out earlier, but Coach Bob-
by Lewis successfully came back
with Sylvis who gave up seven
hits in eight innings.

West Virginia got a. look at
- Carlisle in the ninth and were
completely unsuccessful.

Washington & Jefferson was
no match for their big city op-
ponents as they, fell 16-0. Riccuiti
blasted two home runs and drove
i nsix runs. Mike Supsura also
homered as Andy Alex pitched
three hit ball and walked only
one batter » while striking out
eleven.

The Mitters open their busy
week against Duquesne tomor-
row at Leech Farm Field.

Tennis Coach Analyzes His

Tennis Coach Bill
reads his players in this manner:

“Joe Brown hit hard and fast.
and plays a short match as long
as he can keep the ball in the
court. His forehand shots have
been falling just ‘within the cor-»
ners.

"Dave O‘Laughlin loses a few
game points, but he can hit the
shot he wants to when he wants
to. He's a slow starter.

“Bill Hinkel has started rifting
the ball along the sidelines and
picking up victories. Roger Glas-
er, another slow starter, has be-
gun to smash the ball. He took

his first victory against Duquosne.
“Rzilph Mason has probably the
hardest shot the team
sides Brown. Sometimes he tries
to poke the ball over the net
when his opponent is deep. but
the “smash” is his winner.
“Dick Solyn was inelcigible for
the first three games as he was
a freshman, but he has the agility
and the smash shot that can win
matches. Adrian Hartman, an-
other newcomer, hits the ball
hard, but usually to the same spot.
“The top three are st1'ongest,
but the rest ‘will. improve.”
