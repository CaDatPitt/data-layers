Scream

‘No Grapes’

by BILL ROSEN
Staff News Reporter

Marching from the Civic Arena
through the streets of downtown
Pittsburgh to Market Square, pro-
testers shouted “No Grapes” as
they participated in the Interna-
tional Day of Grape Boycott Dem-
onstrations Saturday.

At Market Square, Al Rojas, co-
ordinator of the Grape Boycott in
Pittsburgh, shouted to the small
crowd that farm workers want
freedom and socialjustice and the
grape growers in California are
denying these justices to their
workers by not recognizing a farm
workers union.

"The poor people of this coun-
try will not tolerate social injus-
tice anymore,” Rojas screamed.

Representing the Allegheny
County Labor Council, Anthony
Lutty pointed out that the labor
movement has taken a strong in-
terest in the poor people's move-
ment. He said that the Council
will support the farm workers but
the problem of the farm workers
is the problem of every citizen in
this country. Lutty concluded by
saying, “The problem of the farm
workers must be solved by sup-
porting the boycott of grapes.”

Tom Quinn, representing the
United Electrical Workers, em-
phasized that the farm workers
are the last unorganized labor
group and “they need our help
There are three million agricul-
tural workers across the country
living in poverty. We must give
these people human dignity and
bring them into the American eco-
nomy,” Quinn said.

After the speaking ceremonies
small groups of car caravans went
into the local neighborhoods. Their
specific purpose was to talk to the
food managers and grocers. and
request them not to handle Cali-
fornia or Arizona grapes.

Two weeks before Thanksgiving,
five‘-major food chains cooperated
with Rojas by not selling Califor-
nia grapes.

When asked if he thought he
would win his fight this year, Ro-
jas replied, “I am not anticipating
winning this year," just in doing a
good job. We will continue to fight
and we know we will eventually
win.”

‘tant and demanding, and more ac-

 

housing director since 1968.
Ginevan plans to open offices spe-
cializing in service to middle man-
agement personnel.

In his new position Vra_na will
be responsible for- administering
all resident and off-campus hous-
ing and for training resident assis-
tants. I

Vrana graduated magna cum
laude from the University in 1965
and received his masters degree
in education in 1968. As an under-.
graduate he was president of Stu-
dent Government and was elected
to Phi Beta Kappa.

In 1965 Vrana joined the Uni-
versity administration as an as-
sistant to the vice chancellor for
student affairs, and later as the
assistant to the dean of student af-
fairs.

As director of student affairs
planning he has worked on budget
planning, research on the atti-
tudes of students, and in the devel-

1973. .

John Vrana admits his enthusi-
asm as he steps into his position
which he hopes will “put him in
closer contact with the students
than in the past.” After a year’s
absence from immediate involve-
ment with the student body ~— he
formerly served as advisor to Stu-
dent Government — Vrana will be
facing a more aware, more expec-

tive student body than he has seen
in his eight years at the Universi-
ty.

Whether or not John Vrana is
capable of meeting this challenge
provided by student activism re-
mains to be seen, but his own‘
words provide some insight into
his philosophy and attitudes to-
ward room and boardproblems,

Special to The Pitt News

' by SCOTT BAUM
SG President

“There is no such thing as an
experimental college, there are.
however. colleges that engage in
experimentation." writes Milton
Sussman in his report. “The Re-
construction of an American Col-
lege.” In the past year the College
of Arts and Sciences has awaken-
ed from its academic torpor. Pre-
sently, under the new dean. the
bureaucratic beast which is the
College has begun to move percep-
tibly toward innovation and
change. To ‘sustain and increase
this movement toward change,
there are two mechanisms at the
student’s disposal.

First, the presence of students
on councils of the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences (the Undergraduate
Council and the Faculty of the
Arts and Sciences_College) guar-
antees voting student participa-

and they may provide insight into
his ability to meet this new chal-
lenge. ~

The problems confronting the
housing office are based on either
the philosophy or the logistics of
housing policies. The new social
rules, demands for sensitivity
training to be incorporated in res-
dent assistant training, and the

possibilities of co-op housing ill-

ustrate areas where conflicting
philosophies can develop.

Vrana “supported -the new so-
cial rules when they were initially
proposed.” In recent discussions
with the housing staff he has
learned they have worked well.
“This responsibility was placed
on the students and they have ac-
cepted it.”

, r. _
JOHN VRANA, new director of Uni-
versity Housing.

 

However, there is a second
means which can involve an infin-
ite number of students and can
truly enhance students’ power.
This second form of involvement
is the non-voting, observing pre-
sence of students at any of these
councils. These students may be
recognized to speak at the discre-
tion of the chairman.

Even more important, these
students have demonstrated con-
cern and the desire for involve-
ment, which can often cause a cer-
tain discomfiture to council mem-
bers who are now suddently aware
of an active student group and
must respond to it. After becom-
ing conversant with the issues
handled by these councils, stu-
dents can show support for pro-
grams by petition or letters and
can lend credence to the claim of
strong student support for any
particular program.

One of the marks of the univer-

sity,’and of the liberal a,rts,col-_ ‘
,-is the never-end-‘

  

 

as See Editorial, page 4 as A 
Decide University’ s Mission    

The new residential complex on
the Hill will be the nearest thing
to co-op housing that the Univer»
sity has sponsored. Vrana has
been active in the planning of this
complex. When asked about the
feasibility of a co-op unit in the
Towers, Vrana replied that he
would “be willing to talk ‘to stu-
dents. I am not against experi-
mentation.” He went on, how-
ever, to point out that such a co-op
venture might not be feasible for
the Towers. Vrana admits it will
require ,a couple of months on the
job to be aware of the contingen-
cies of any new proposals.

Last winter a group of concern-
ed students, who attended the ra-
cism forum on Feb. 21, asked
that the Housing office include sen-

‘ sitivity training as part of its reg-

ular summer retreat for resident
assistants. Vrana feels that “sen—
sitivity training is a good thing. It
makes people think deeply and
carefully.” Providing the finan-
cial and personnel resources were
available, Vrana would support
sensitivity training as an effort to
alleviate unconscious racism.

The newly acquired apartment
building on Centre Ave., the prob-
lems of off-campus housing in
Oakland, and the policies on meal
service reflect the logistic situa-
tions to be faced.

Vrana was quick to discuss the
new apartment building for grad-
uate and foreign students as an ill-
ustration of the efforts being
made, to face the continually
crowding dorm conditions. He did
not as yet have any proposals for
future projects.

Off-campus housing aroused
considerable interest from Vrana
who said it was an area of vital
importance to him.

The College of Arts and Sci-
ences has annouced the approved
alternative’ courses which have
been designated. by each foreign
language department as accept-
able substitutes for language lev-
el four. (See page two for list of
courses.)

Sudents should be aware of the

following clarifications regarding 4

this new policy.
—I. If the student has already tak-

en one of the designated cours- ' ’

es the requirement is consi-
.,. dered met.

-2. Ideally the student should

take the alternative course - ‘

during the, term ..in which he

would have normally taken ‘

language level four. How-
ever, the College recognizes

the problems of scheduling 
and prerequisites and has ,i
only stipulated that the alter- '
native course be taken prior

to graduation.

-3. Students who have already

registered for the fall term _

and wish to register for an al-

ternative to language level

four should not contact their
academic advisors until after
receiving the fall schedule
card. (The card is due to be
mailed between May 12 and

Additional information may be

obtained from academic advisors 

or the College, 917 CL, ext. 453 or

This announcement is a follow-
up on the decision for curriculum

Student Power

JAN BAKER
PRODUCTION EDITOR I

 

IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIL‘

Student power was plastered all over this paper last fall. Many stu-
dents were turned off by the idea. Many of them associated student power
with SDS and hippies. Endless hours were spent trying to explain to students
what the real meaning of student. power was. .

Now it is quite obvious here at the University what student power can

be.

Student power can be the mere act of any student standing up and voic-
ing his or her opinion about matters which concern them. Luckily, unlike
many other campuses, there is someone here who will listen to that voice.

The endless lists of campus tragedies across the nation and the world
are the result of student power of a much stronger nature. At the majority of
other campuses, student power in the form of demonstrations, take-overs,
sit-ins, violence, and student strikes is necessary just to get the Administra-
tion to listen to the much more peacefullvoice of student power.

Here, however, there has been no need for violence. Students have used
the greatest tactics and logic possible to obtain the ear of the Administration.
That ear is presently open. It is not only open, it is resting patiently on the
side of the head of the Administration which is turned toward the student body.

That head turned after many hours of debate, discussion, and with
much deliberation. But it turned. ’

That ear opened after much dialogue. But it opened.

All that is necessary now is for something to be said before the ear
closes and the head turns back tothe more mundane matters of a large uni-
versity.

Speak. Talk. Yell. Scream. Shout. Holler.  .

The Administration has told the student he has a voice. ‘Notas much of
,a voice as some student leaders would like, but a voice. Use it. Use it now be-
fore it’s too late. In a short year or two a massive expansion program will be-
gin, and quite possibly the Administration will not have time to listen. They

» have time now. They want to hear from you. But what do you talk about?

If you’re not familiar with your rights as a student, a special supple-
ment in Friday’s paper may point out a few things you don’t know. Things
like self-designed majors, fewer distribution courses. alternatives for the
fourth term of a language, and the possible abolishment of grades will be ex-
plained. '

But, if you know something about what students can do here, take a few
hours out of your busy schedule and attend the meeting of the Undergraduate
Council tomorrow morning at 9 in 917 Cathedral.

‘ No, student power isn’t just the ugly burning and beating you see on the
tube. It’s merely you, yes you, standing up and saying what you think about
your education. Granted, We’re lucky.someone wants to listen, but don’t wait.

Limits Their Perceptions Of Campus Unrest

Graduation
Day Blues
by Paul Stoller

It was an unusually hot April After-
noon, and I had a real case of spilchas.
My parents were driving from Washing-
ton for my graduation, and they were 45
minutes late; it was 1:00 p.m. If they didn’t
come soon, I would have to go down to the
Civic Arena —— a concrete conical severed by
the ground — without them. What a waste,
I thought. Why the hell should they come
all the way from Washington to hear a bunch
of boring speeches. Maybe graduation was

‘ something symbolic to Mom and Dad?

Maybe it was like the maturation of an in-
vestment?

AT ANY RATE, mom and Dad finally
arrived at the apartment, and I hoped in-
to the Cadillac. '

“Paul, let me see that beard,” said Mom.
“Oh, its ugly. Don’t you think-you could
shave it off?”

(‘Nope’)?

“Well, I don’t like it one bit . i. . Oh Paul,
how long will the graduation take?”

“Only about an hour, Mom. I hope it
doesn’t last any longer.”

-“WELL, I hope it doesn’t last too long
because your father and I are tired; it was
a long drive, and we ran into all this traf-
fic on the watchamacallit?”

“The Penn Lincoln Parkway.”
“Yeah, that’s it. .
“There’s a ballgame today, Mom. We’re

’ near downtown.”

The Cadillac ran into a lot of traffic -
graduation traffic — near the Arena, and I
got out of the car.

“Paul, we’ll meet ya in front of the mar-
quis after the ceremonies,”

“O.K., dad.” .

I WAS IN a hurry that day. Some of the
kids were planning a bland but generally
acceptable protest against the war in Viet-

’ nam. I rushed in through Gate No. 2 into

the basement waiting area which sur-
rounded the main floor of the arena. I was

. looking for one of my close friends, J. T.

IllIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIE

“Stoller, Stoller, over here.” <
“Where’s my armband, J. T. ”
“Here, I’ll put in on for you.”

Clad in an oversized cap and gown with
a white armband, to protest the Vietnam
War, I looked at the graduating seniors of
the school of Arts and Sciences. It was one
huge mass-produced swar of humanity. I
saw a lot of familiar faces that meant noth-
ing to me.'_I saw many acquaintances and
few friends. There were many smiling
faces, but they seemed empty. I guess I

felt that all those caps and gowns were jus_t
supposed to smile on graduation. Finally
I spotted Bloom, a girl who knew me pret-
ty well. I gently grabbed her arm and we
marched together in the processional.» Af-
ter standing on our feet for the almost
the entire 20 minutes of the damn proces-
sional, Bloom and I sat in our chairs along
with the other caps and gowns.

THIS IS A pretty
Paul; it’s a pretty crappy society.’.’._,-

“Yeah, Yeah. This thing is a God—damn‘

bore. And this cap keeps falling ‘off my
head. The hell with it.”

“I hope it’s over pretty soon, Paul.”

“Yeah, me too. Lets get on with this
tragedy.” V

“I’m not quite sure, I know what you
mean, Paul?”

“Well, look around you Bloom. Look at
all the caps and gowns. It all fits neatly
into the pattern. We will graduate about
4,000 persons today, right. But how many
of these people have wasted their four
years? How many of these people have the
courage to face themselves somewhat ob-
jectively. How many of these people will
wake up in ten years only to find themselves
trapped in a deep mental crevass of absurd

routine. I hate to say it Bloom, but I think‘:

most of this graduating class is fright-
fully stupid. Maybe ignorance is really
biliss. Huh?”

“YOU MIGHT BE right Paul. It’s ex-
pecially true of the girls. Half the girls
here think they are happy just because
they’re engaged. And the girls who aren’t
engaged are really scared. They’ve been
secure. You know Mommie and Daddie
have really taken care of them, and now
they are facing some real freedom; some
real independence, That’s scareyl ”

“Usually, it’s a facade. Few girls in col-
lege are strong enough to truly be inde-
pendent of men and social standards. Most
girls need the pervasive security of im-
mediate post-graduation marriage.”

“Jesus Christ. The security bag can real-
lv get vou down sometimes. What a damn

waste. The best years of life, are betweea’19»-

22 and 30. There’s so much to experience.
I wonder why peoplewant to limit their

- life experience. Life is so short, and is
unfortunately limited. Why limit it fur-_ I

ther?

“I don’t want to do that, Paul. I’ve got
a lot of living to do.”

“S0 DO I. But I suppose each of us
must make our own choices. Most of these
cap and gowns will probably lead super-
ficial, but essentially happy lives, I guess.
But there is so much more to life than a pay
check, two-weeks of vacation, and three

bedroom house. Oh well, each person mus 5”"

mold his own life. I just hope the caps and
gowns can bear the consequences of their.
type of life.

“Everything is so harsh, Paul.”

“Your right, Bloom. but the sooner peo-
ple get their heads out of the clouds
and face reality — themselves —~ the better
off they will be. Hey is that the music of
the recessional?”

“Yeah. Let’s go.

Bloom and I left the Arena floor, de-
posited our cursed caps and gowns, collec;
ted out $10, and picked up our diplomas.
We said goodbye.

I MET MY PARENTS in front of the
Civic Arean Marquis. We walked to the
Cadillac, drove a few miles, ate at Wein-
steins. Mom and Dad then drove me back
to my apartment, and journeyed back to
Washington. ' '

It was just another typical graduation
day..

Q

crappy ceremony _

by HOBART HARRIS

I had‘ gone home this vacation
asking myself why people were
getting so upset about- campus
riots and such things. After all,
there is really very little that a
riot on campus can do to hurt
anyone not directly associated with
a University. We can’t take away
anyone’s job, like a new tarriff,
agreement might, we can’t des-/
troy very many homes, the way
a major ghetto uprising could,
we can’t even stop the subways._
Yet there is absolutely nothing
that has the country more excit-
ed these days than the riots. Why?

I began to get a peek at an
answer one night as I sat with my
parents watching the news, which,
as_it had done all during the week
I was home, was spending at least
twenty of its thirty minutes on the
various demonstrations going on
around the country. I remember
taking it all very calmly. What’s
so exciting about a demonstra-
tion? But not my parents. Huddled

over the weak light from the screen
as they were, all they could see

was long hair, four letter words,

promiscuity, pot, revolt. “Look

at this one — I bet he hasn’t open-

ed a book since he was there, look

at that one —- he probably never
heard of a bath tub.” A

The emotional tone of the
adults as they huddled over the
set was more than anything else
similar to what the pioneers must
have felt as they ‘gathered their
wagons into a circle and stuck
close to the fire, watching the
indians going through their war
dances and waiting for the at-
tack. To me, the demonstrations
were just a bunch of kids with
some legitimate grievances who
had gotten in over their heads.
To my parents, however, it was
the gathering of the apocalypse.

One night, the demonstrations‘
were over open admissions for
Ghetto -residents to City College.
While I don’t’ necessarily agree

. with the idea, I'm not afraid of it

either. So I asked my parents why
they were. And the answer was
the answer, really, to the whole

question of why the adult popu-

lation of the country seems so
afraid of what is going on. The
reason was, quite simply, that my
sister is graduating High School
this June and is preparing to go
to Buffalo. Would they
away her acceptance in order to
give her place to a ghetto kid?
My parents were afraid that they
would.

So there it was. My parents,
generally quite liberal (in the
Stevensonian sense of the word)
had worked and slaved all their
lives for only one thing — their
kids. And now, right at the point
where it seemed that their labors
were to bear fruit, they were con-
fronted with the possibility that
my sisterwould be denied an ed-
ucation, and they couldn’t handle
it. Who could? So they reacted
with fear and hatred. They. had
been so committed to our havinga

take i

little better life than they had had
that their fearwas that much the
greater. Love is an irrational
thing, and so is fear.

iOur parent’s commitment to
our future is literally so .great
that they have lost the ability

to discriminate legitimate ac—_

tions . from illegitimate; social
protest fom revolution, and have
bumped everyone not in the li-

G brary studying, with those out in

the street burning. ‘There is no
middle ground.

The central feature of the riots
is that they are dedicated to so-
cial change, and, to- borrow a
pharse from Stokely Charmichael,
fear of change is as American as
Cherry pie. We’re a strange
country in that way. In most
every European country, the mid-
dle working class is clearly aligned
against the upper classes in favor
of ‘a more equitable distribution
of the wealth,
social change as the instrument

. of the wealth, and profound so-

and profound -

 

cial change as the instrument of
this new distribution. Socialism,
a dirty word in American unions,
was accepted in Europe way be-
fore the turn of the century.

But here in America we’re stuck

with a ‘rather strange albatrossgj,

that has led the working classes
put up with unspeakably raw
deals that their cousins in Europe
would not stand for in a second,
and that albatross is the belief
that this is an upwardly mobile
society, that every boy has a chance
to make it to the top. What this
results in is a committment to the
status quo in the belief that it is
on your side, or at least your child-
ren’s. Any effort toward quali-
tative change is a challenge to
all that our parents have worked
towards for themselves, and es-

pecially their children. And that’s

why the riots, even though they do
not have the ability to challenge

our parent’s lives materially, do‘:

something infinitely more fear-
ful. They challenge our parents’ .

hopes for the future.

Editor, The Pitt News;

I’d like to commend the Pitt
News on its fine coverage of the
first annual May Day rally at
the University of Pittsburgh and
also to commend Staff News
Writer Anne Dorn on a fair and
—on the whole — accurate piece of
reporting. There were two
errors in her article, however,
which might give some people
the wrong idea about what a
couple of the speakers actually
said.

Joseph Yablonsky of the Uni-
ted Mineworkers is quoted as
saying, “I know the SDS is villi-
fied as military, but nothing was
ever achieved in the world with-
out getting militant.” (Emphas-
is added.) Militancy should not
be equated with militarism, be-
cause they’re two different things,

mediate attention, greater op-
portunities for students to study
religion in a formal way are also
crucial.

Anderson is quite right in point-
ing to several ways in which re-
ligion might presently be studied
in relation to other academic dis-
ciplines. Such as ‘interdisciplin-

Delightful

and in fact, Mr. Yablonsky actual-
ly said, “I know the SDS is villi-
fied as militant. . . . .”

Gabriel Tortella of the His-
tory Department is paraphrased
as saying that in the early 1930’s
fascists in Spain “employed Ku
Klux Klan methods to stir up the
workers, which in turn resulted in
a fascist military intervention
. . . . . ”.In fact, Mr. Tortella as-
serted that the Ku Klux Klan
methods were used against the‘
Spanish working class organiza-
tion and that it was the elec-
toral triumph of the workers and
the Left in Spain which result-
ed in the fascist military reac-
tion.

Despite these errors, it was a

good article. 4 g Sincerely,

ary approach is not without value.
However, it is a bit like the icing
without the cake.

Instead of responding to the er-
rors in Father William Clancy’s
edited article in the New York
Times some weeks ago, it would

seem to me more useful to speak‘

to the best of his analysis. As I
understand it, Clancy’s funda-
mental idea was that the study of
religion in its own right is and
has been a viable academic con-
cern in higher education with con-

    
  

 

siderable personal and social re-
levance. As.Clancy points out one
does not, in the main, study econ-
omics through the Department of
English or English through the

Department of Philosophy, even
though there are curricular over-
laps among such disciplines.

It would be my hope that this
question at Pitt not be lost
amidst the politics of either aca-
demia or sectarian religion.

Thinclads Breeze By Wayne,
Close-Out Season Tomorrow

by BOB LEDERMAN

Jim Banner’s thinclads brought their own brand of sun-
shine to an otherwise gloomy, damp and cold Pitt Stadium last
Saturday as they handily defeated Wayne State,‘ 89-56.

The times and distances recorded during the afternoon of track and

field competition could hardly be deemed outstanding, yet they were
more than adequate to hand the men of Banner their first victory in

in dual meet competition.
Bryant Salter, jumping with

a heel injury which has slightly

improved, captured a first place
in the triple jump (46-6) and a sec-
ond place in the high jump. Sal-
ter’s winning effort in the triple
jump was a significant step up
from his disappointing showing

during the‘ Big Four Track Clas-
sic.

it appeared as if the thinclads
were just out for practice. In

both races the trackmen left‘Wayne

Kouvolo Cites Olympics

by MARTHA HARTLE
Associate Sports Editor

For sophomore Dan Kouvolo, his varsity track and field
career has just begun. But the little javelin thrower from Am-

I ‘ bridge alreay has his sights set on the Olympics.

In his first outdoor season with the varsity thinclads, Kouvolo has al-
ready broken the Pitt Stadium record for the javelin throw and has bet-

tered his own personal mark as well.

In the Big Four Meet two
weeks ago, Kouvolo broke the
stadium mark with a toss of 229
feet. The existing record had stood
since 1939. His best performance
came in the second meet of the
season against Ohio University
as he recorded a throw of 236’
11”. His previous high was 235
feet, which he set in high school.

Despite all his record-break-
ing performances this spring, Kou-

—volo is confident that he can do

even better this season. “I
should be throwing about 260

- feet by the end of the season,” he

explained. “If I get a good meet
and some good weather, I should
be up there.”

Kouvolo cited the cold weather
as a key factor in his performance
thus far. “Last year I hurt my arm
throwing and in the cold weather,
it tightens. I like it warm.”

In the recent meet with Wayne

E State, the temperature was excep-

tionally cool and Kouvolo threw
8”. That was good
enough to take first place honors,
but far short of his goal of 260.

As for the Olympics, Kou-
volo has set his goal and he is con-
fident of obtaining it. “I’m de-
finitely going to be shooting for
the Olmypics in 1972,” he quip-
ped, “and I hope to make it. The
Olympic record for the javelin is

295 feet. I think I'll need about-

275-280 to make the team?’
In addition to throwing the

javelin, Kouvolo has also been com-

peting in a handful of other field
events this spring. Against Wayne
State he also participated in the
pole vault. triple jump and dis-
cus. It was the first time Kouvolo
had thrown the discus all sea-

son, yet he grabbed third place
in the event.

“He tries everything,” com-
mented a teammate. “He goes
wild.”

“The Javelin’s
though,” Kouvolo said. “I just
do everything else for the fun of
it.”

As a high school senior he set‘

the Pennsylvania State track
meet record and was later invit-
ed to the Golden West Track and
Field Competition in Sacramen-
to, California where he grabbed
second place honors in a national
field.

Coming up in the near future are
crucial Eastern and national com-
petitions.

Kouvolo is confident of win-
ning in the IC4A’s at Rutgers.
later this month. He cited Mary-
land's Ed Reese and Army’s Bob
Wallace‘ as two of the best jave-
lin throwers in the East. They
both throw around 250 feet.
Kouvolo has thrown over 250 in
practice, but not in competi-
tion.

But by IC4A time, Dan Kou-
volo expects some good weather,
a 260 toss and a win.

Rain halted the scheduled
double header between Coach

ters and the Syracuse Orange-
men, Saturday. Afternoon. put-
ting the baseballers closer to
an unwanted record.

The postponement was the

earlier in the season was rain-
ed-out.

in the fall some time.” the
coach mentioned. And, we’ll
have to make a larger sche-
dule —— about 35 games and a lot
of double headers. Then, the
rainouts won’t bother us.”

In the mile run, it wasvJerry
Richey, Mark Vornhagen and
Greg ‘Rodgers all breaking the tape
together.

The two-mile race saw Mike No-
lan join the above “in crowd" for
the afternoon’»s second dead
heat.

Following his record breaking
toss in the Big Four meet a week
ago, Dan Kouvolo took an easy
first in the javelin competition.
Kouvolo, in hurling the javelin
a sub-par 219-8, continued in
his winning ways further bright-
ening what has been a success-
ful year for. him.

Thirty-six of the best col-
lege baseball players in the
area will cover the grounds at
Forbes Field May 25, at 1:00
p.m. in the first Tri-State
Coaches Association All-Star
Game.

The Coaches’ organization
is in its first year; the game is
the group’s first major step
towards their goal of increas-
ing local interest in baseball
at the college level.

“We hope to get more
publicity, to promote college
baseball’’ baseball coach Bob-
by Lewis (one of the members)
said. “We want to mount in-
terest in the game.”

“It seems ridiculous prac-
ticing all spring for fourteen

     
   

  

games,” he added. “You prac-
tice more than you play.”

      
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

 means that the best they can
 do for the campaign is to grab
 ten wins, since only six games
 remain on the schedule.

Carlos Reisen contributed his
share to the trackster’s victory
by taking top spots in the 440-
yard intermediate hurdles and
the 120-yard High hurdles. Reisen
has been a fairly consistent win-
ner for Banner this year an_d is
only one of many reasons for the
rise of Pitt track this season.
