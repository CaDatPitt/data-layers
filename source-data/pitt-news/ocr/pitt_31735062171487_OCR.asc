SG Head "R-éassigiis Prioi'ilies”

by BOB BONN

Rumors that Lenny Klavonic has resigned as
Student Government president are false.

Since Klavonic has been seen working in the Reg-
istrars office each morning. some students have
assumed that Klavonic has given up or cut down his

duties as head of SC.

According to Klavonic. "I spent, the entire sum-
mer working on Student Government and subse-
quently didn't have the opportunity to work. So now
l'm working part—time and trying to, meet my rent

and food expenses.

Last week, he said, was the first opportunity he
had to attend any of his scheduled classes. “So now

I’m attending classes with a lot more frequency,
where before the time was spent with SG business,

meetings and programs.

"I havent given up Student Government. just re-
assigned time priorities to work on it in the eve-
nings and during free time. I‘m still functioning as
before. its just that economic and academic rea-
sons have necessitated that I stagger my schedule
when working with SG and going to classes.“ ’

like.“

Klavonic mentioned his personal frustration at

working all summer on Student Government and
seeing what he termed the “tremendous apathy at

the University.“

The president cited an example of an activity
which fell through recently. “The Legal Awareness
Committee set up a day where security officers and
students could interact in a day-long program
which, after-being publicized in the Pitt News no
less than three times, was responded to by only one

application from a student.”

 

LENNY KLAVONIC
Student Government President

Klavonic complained that theres a tremendous
amount of griping on the part of students regarding
functions in the school. "Yet when it comes time
for applications for committees that determine
programs. the most vocal students are the last ones
to apply in order to change something they don‘t

Reflecting on his own problem of personal time
versus SG‘s time. Klavonic said. “The duties are

too much for one person to really handle to optimum

‘ advantage.

“In the new constitution, we've tried to delegate
as much responsibility as possible to other people
in specific areas, such as activities, programming,
academics, and services.

"l~‘ormerly this power was that exclusively of

one Student Government president.‘

Fiscal Woes Confront New Manager

I3og.,>'us Bomb Scares  
Plugzue Law School 
And Lmigley Hull **

by BOB GING
News Editor

While students were making
plans for the election recess. last
Thursday. the l’niversity receiv-
ed its third and fourth threats of
a bomb planted on the campus.
The first call came from the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation and
from the City of Pittsburgh” Po-
lice at about 11 a.m.

Lniversity officials were told
that a call had been made and a
bomb had been placed on the 14th
floor of the Cathedral of Learning.
in the Law School. Officers from
the Bomb and Arson squad
searched the vicinity of the Law
School and two suspicious looking
brief cases turned out to be no
more than brief cases.

Although the threats proved un-
true. rumor spread about campus
that a bomb had-. been found in the
Law School. Subsequent checks
with the Pittsburgh Police and
members of the University ad-
ministration have shown that this
speculation was no more than ru-
mor and that no bombs were
found.

Five or’ ten minutes after the
bomb threat, a librarian at Lang-

Oakland Parking Lot
Eyed By C()111n1ute1's

by STEVE LUBETSKY

The Commuter Association
«C.-\» has been at odds lately
with the administration and
John lxatsur. Jr.. the owner oi
three parking lots on Dawson
St. Bates St. and Oakland Ave.
respectively.

\
)

Larry Elder. treasurer of CA.
reported several complaints he
received from commuters regard-
ing Katsurs parking facilities.
According to Elder. a number of
students have protested that Kat-
sur’s lots are muddy and unpaved
and during the winter. their cars
get stuck in the snow.

Others have also complained.
Elder said. that their cars have
been scraped on the curbs upon
driving out of the lots.

The University purchased the

.. A land on which Katsur has run two

of his three lots as part of its‘ex-
pansion project and leased it back

. to him on the provision that he re-

s_ti;ictls_-the facility to students and

v»

is $6 for a pass.

Assessing the Universitys ac-
tion. Elder conveyed his suspi-
cions that the University rented
the land to avoid paying the city
parking tax.‘ He said that when
Katsurs lease expires next
spring. the CA will attempt to se-

cure the lease and operate the lots B"

less expensively.

The CA treasurer added that
"we are willing to pay a tax on
parking."

Elder emphasized that his con-
cern lies “not in the complaints
that were filed, nor in the motives
of the administration, but in ob-
taining the lease itself

He also maintained that "the
lot is accessible.“ He mentioned
that l)ave Smith. L'niversity
treasurer. assured him that the
CA could have the lease "if it ac-
cepts the responsibility."

Smith responded that he "is not H

the least enthused about the CA

undertaking such’ an enterprise.“-

previously served as sports direc-
tor. announcing director and disc
jockey.

“My big aim,” Rose said, “is to
regenerate student interest. I
want all the students to be made
aware of the station. I hope to re-
new this interest by improving the

. station and by serving all the stu-

dents.”

Rose has come into the midst
of the many fiscal problems of the
station. Presently. WPGH is ap-
plying for emergency allocations
from Student Government «SO».
Although the station requested
15000 from the SG Allocations
Committee. they were given $2.-
000.

Because of this. they no longer
have use of their teletype and the
[Pl wire service. since the cost
of the service alone runs about
$2.000.

Bobby Davis, public relations
manager, expressed, “Not only
are we in desperate need of news
reporters, but also people with
clerical abilities and engineers.”

  

Aside from these problems. the
station is also having trouble with
its transmitters. After shifting
the ones they do have around to
compensate for the bad ones.

Tower B is still left without one.

The only place left for them to
switch transmitters is the one at
the Nurses Residence. Unfortun-
ately. it is too small to carry Tow-
er B's loa(i.

Along with these responsibil-
ities. the station ‘is still going
through with its plans to go FM.

In order to get their FM license,
the station must prove to the FCC
that it can support itself for five
years.

Davis added. "We all feel that
the acquisition of this license is
extremely important because the
station would then be heard by
commuters.

"Also. I believe that it can real-
ly boost the University image by
reaching more ears. For exam-
ple. going FM could not only bring
more advertising to us. but also
more business to the University

It would be difficult to say that
Greek Tragedy provides us with
any great surprises, at least I
doubt if anyone on openinginight
had not guessed the eventual out-
come after the first few moments
of the play. Its not really a matter
of guessing either. because the
Chorus told us who was going to
go and just about when. But then.
Greek Tragedy is somewhat like a
game that must be played out.

There is little subtlety in the
story line and unlike some of our
more modern drama forms. it
doesn‘t quite explode (though we
know that the ending will bring a
chaotic blow) but slowly develops.
depicting the whys and where-
fore‘s of the initial statement of
"I will . .  "I am . .  "I must
be . .  »

Someone “will die" well enough
once the reasons are stated—in
fact most all must go one way or
another to redeem the outcry for
justice. and exalt the pure and un-
tained viewpoint that idealism is
the “truth in which life has all
meaning."

What the Greeks say with death
is a bit too spiritual for me. It is
the‘ believability of the tragedy of
“life” from this framework that
makes such sacrifice a bit hard
to buy. But, then again, the Greeks
posed idealism as the salvation
from the chaos of a bitter world.

The main characters are glori-
fied in taking a stand against con-
ciliation. It is Greek Tragedy that
proclaims a glor_y in death as a
final cord of acclamation. of con-
viction. or perhaps even defeat of
something that we may know can
never be.

Creon. Kind of Thebes. although
he survives. looses the game the-
oretically. Although he still has
his life. it is not the glory of living
as the Greeks saw it. It is now
just a job—just a game for win-
ning at any cost.

It may seem to be awfully un-

productive way of solving prob-
lems--all this dying for the ideal
that doesn’t exist or that must be
and isn’t—but then this conflict is
the classic tragedy, and although
we may not be shocked at thegout-
come, how the game is played out,
is of urgent issue.

This conflict between the ideal
and the real might be considered
by some today as pertinent. and
by others a incompatible farce be-
tween sentiment: and what life is
“really” all about.

As Satre said. "I speak for the
real and against realism." He
spoke for most French drama-
tists including Jean Anouilh.
whose version of Sophocles "An-
tigone" now plays at the Studio
Theatre. ,

This conflict of the ideal against
the real is the main subject of
most of the works of this French
playwright. It is thus easily seen
why the tragedy of Sophocles
would be chosen for the theme of
one of his major works.

In his portrayal of admirable
characters. he invokes the re-
mote past in such figures as Anti-
gone. Joan. in “The Lark" and

   
   

Beckett. Even though the hall-
mark of Anouilh .may be called
cynicism. it is perhaps more in
the guise of despair over man's
betrayal of love and the impulse
of ideals.

Like Anouilh's Beckett — who
sacrifices his life. not for religi-
ous conviction but for commit-
ment to a task he has solemnly
undertaken—-so Antigone throws
her life on the line in the role of
dissenter, But in reality the life
she sees is not life at all. but a
way of living that is far from
ideal even as it is practicle.

It is that pact against the “real-
ism” of Creon’s practicality of
life (“life is a tool and no more
than the happiness you get out of
it”) and the corner that she is
marked to defend that makes it
impossible for her to do anything
else but to die honorably, virtu-
ously, and with valour for the kind
of life that she sees.

Whether or not we agree with
what she dies for or not—it is An-
ouilh’s struggle with Creon’s
imansi betrayal of. and commit-
ment to. a life without the “ideal"
that brings his downfall. even as

RICHARD JAKIEL DIRECTS

“Antig0ne“ may look like an
easy show to mount—but it is not.
Because of its directness the ap-
proach taken must be fairly ac-
curate——for even as it may appear
simple and too the point-—there is
much that can collapse if the di-
rector goes to far off course.

Accurate blocking is essentail
. . . too much movement could be
disastrous . . . and a lack of sensi-
tivity both in staging and charac-
terization could easily reflect a
lack of affect that means much in
a work such as this.

Unlike Genet. who’s writings
cause us to get bogged down in the
subtleness of interpretation. An-
ouilh depends more on «clarity»
and motion to bring out a crisp
and powerful play. It is far more
definable in terms of "depth of
characterization“ and the inter-
action. both verbal and physical.
of the players. as they move
around the stage.

Although there are some points
to contest. Richard .Jakiel has
brought out many of the finer mo-
ments in this work and ha.s deli-
cately at times. put together a bet-
ter than average show for Studio
Theatre.

Furthermore. the reverance is

rather than repressed.

The implications of this new
concept of patriotism on the con-
temporary scene are evident. A
brief example concerns Agnew‘s
recent attack. on Senator God-
dell of New York. Senator Goddell
is dovish on the war. thus elicit-
ing the following response from
Agnew: - b

"When a man consistently op-
poses a President of his own par-
ty on the greatest issues of the
day; when a manmakes public
opposition to all his party stands

for a major article of his politi-
cal faith; when a man goes out
of his way publicly to reject sup-

port of his President that has

not yet been offered: when a
man attempts to curry favor
with his party’s leading adver-
saries by gratuitous attacks on
fellow party members - then I
think that man has strayed be-
yond the point of no return.” ‘ ‘

It is not my primary aim to
question the truth of‘ Agnew‘s
attack. though Newsweek label-
ed it as exaggerated. My point
concerns Agnew‘s expectations

 

of blind obedience to the Presi-

dents policy by Republican
Congressmen.

One wonders why we should
have a Congress at all if it is
expected to be filled by a bunch
of _ves-men (lackeys). What is
the difference betweenthe ex-
treme case of the Agnew-type
Congress (where we have a
majority of seats held by Repub-
lican Congressmen) and No

congress at all? The only diIf- .

ference its that with no congress
at all. the dictatorship would
be more obvious.

Staff Columnist j
. The people of Seattle. Washington are pre-
sently facing a crisis situation not dissimilar to

the evolving fascistization of U.S. society. Dis- I

counted by the Nixon administration as a worth-
lessgarea for developing Republican electoral
strength. the Justice Department has brought
down its second federal conspiracy indictment
against eight Seattleites.I,' I

B The rationale for the indictments‘ comes
from a demonstration of 3.000 people which
turned into a Police riot following the Chicago
Conspiracy verdict.

In order to understand thecharges pending
against the Seattle eight it is necessary to un-
derstand why Attorney General John Mitchell
considered federal repression‘ in Seattle neces-
sary.

Sixty per cent of the Seattle labor force is

employed by or directly dependent on Boeing
Aircraft Corporation. In its competition with
Lockheed and other corporate partners in the

military-industrial complex. Boeing was losing --

its "Defense" contracts in federal bidding.

The Boeing’ executives began laying off
workers (20,000)
funds to gain a bargaining advantagefor fed-

eral contractingof B-1 Fighter Bombers com-

ing up. The contract came (up and went to
Lockheed.-

Unemployment has since skyrocketed” in‘

Seattle to the astronomical level of 20 percent.
The people of Seattle began to see through

the right wing and liberal positions presented-
“ by politicians. The Right. they discounted. in _

that it was clearly anti-working class. racist
and not the least bit concerned about the well

" being of the people of Seattle. - ‘

L Liberals were -easily discounted ‘ on the
basis that they feel working people reapbenel

in order to have sufficient-

fits from imperialist wars; The dismembered‘

bodies of their sons aswell as’ job insecurity_

and economic dependency on full-scale militari-
zation.» discounted the I’ Liberal appraisal in

workers‘ eyes. However. a concrete alternative -
to the demagogery of American politics was

offered. the Seattle Liberation Front‘ (SLF).. \
The Seattle Liberation Front was formed

. with the intention of moving the focus of radi-

cal politics from the campus to thecommunity.
and to deal with problems facing the whole city
of Seattle and not just those facing upper and
middle class kids. . -

The Front is comprised of living» and work-

ing collectives (15-20 people) attempting to re-
late to the needs of people in Seattle. '

I The SLF called a demonstration at the fed-
eral courthouse-.to protest the heavy contempt
sentences placed on lawyers and defendents in

Chicago and the racist treatment of Bobby Seale. .

A planned rally before the demonstration never
occurred. because the people who came spon-
taneously began to surge forward and charge th
courthouse. I '

In the ensuing four hours Police battled the
demonstrators. Windows at the courthouse and
downtown businesses were broken and" Police
proceeded to riot. Although what happened at
the courthouse was a completely spontaneous
outpouring of the rage felt by millions at the
contempt sentences handed down by Julius
Hoffman in Chicago. the Government moved
two months later to indict eight people for
conspiracy. . - I .

~ The response of the establishment and its
media was to red-bait the SLF and paint it as
a bunch of crazies and mad anarchists. The SLF
responded ..with a concrete program for the peo-
ple of Seattle. ’ * - - V

centers_and educational programs with high pri-
ority to' the Black and Brown neighborhoods
and Indian reservations. ' "

The SLF collectives were involved in such
things as creating a breakfast program outside‘
of lengthy unemployment lines and organizing
unions for the unemployed. ‘

Another collective dealt. with fighting the

I ~ construction of a highway to be built through
the Black community connec_tingI suburbia with ’

downtown. _
Thebase of a radical alternative to the status

quo politics was built in Seattle and had begun _

making serious inroads toward reaching working
class (particularly young workers) people.

This is the -reason John Mitchell has slapped_

a federal conspiracy. indictment on Seattleites.‘
Six of the eight under indictment for con-
spiracy. involving interstate communications.
to incite riot, are members of the SLF. I

The indictment was framed in a manneY5‘.:

similar to the Chicago Conspiracy. trying to
tie the defendents in with everything and every-

body and including a few defendents who are"

obviously. totally unrelated to the- events ‘in

question. so that the jury can find them inno-we
cent and then feel it has been liberal when it.‘

finds the rest guilty. . .. .

Among the c_o-conspirators are a number of
young bombers who are currently in jail—the.

hope being that the anti—bombing sentiment I
which has accompanied the high numberiof._

Seattle bombings in recent months will fall on
the defendants as well.‘ I I

A District Attorney had to be brought from B
-the outside to prosecute because the local D.A.
thought the case against the Seattle eight was‘
too weak. .

The Trial site has been shifted from. Seattle .

to Tacoma by the court in order toremove the
trial proceedings from supporters of the defend-
ents. I ” *

Mike Lerner. one of the Seattle eight, sums"

it --up. “Trough we have many problems in the
Seattle Liberation Front. something important

is happening here. Seattle had a general strike .

here in‘ 1919 and for several days all the work-
ers stayed away from their jobs and waited for
the strike to spread. Instead. it was greeted with
apathy and indifference from the rest of the.
country. The great fearof the Seattle Libera-
tion Front is isolation-that no one will even
hear about it when the Conspirators are sentto

jail. that ‘no one will know about the advances‘

made‘ by the movement here in working with
workers. We have learned that there are many’
people. written off by others as unorganizvgable‘.
who can begin to move in an anti-imperialist
and anti-racist direction if people are willing to

--It Depends (In Individual

To the Editor. (The Pitt News):

I have viewed as being some-
how superficial the recent ex-
change of letters and articles
concerning fraternities. Cer-
tainly it is true that fraternities
contain members who are bigot-
ed; certainly fraternities are
adopting new and mature po-
licies with regard to pledging;
and dertainly fraternity houses
are a source of noise. Neverthe-
less, the dispute concerning these
relative aspects of the fraternity
system indicates a misunderstand-
ing of the nature of fraternities
on this campus.

Fraternities membership. years
ago, may have been a measure
of an individuals relative status.
But this situation. in which the
fraternities are regarded as
status-providing organizations.
no longer exists at the University
of Pittsburgh.

The University is far more
heterogeneous than it was 20
years ago; the University is far
larger than it was even ten
years ago. As everything.now
stands. no single group is cap-
able of dictating a general atti-
tude or style of life for the un-
dergraduate student body. Fra-
ternities no longer have an in-
herent status of which the Uni-
versity as a whole looks upon
with envy.

There is no outside pres-
sure upon an individual to ac-
quire some form of artificial
status by joining a fraternity.
Fraternities are nothing special.
except to those individuals, who
for any reason. have voluntar-
ily chosen to affiliate them-
selves with those fraternities.

fraternities and of fraternity
members is to attribute to these
organizations and individuals a
false status. a false status based
upon a view of this University
not as it presently is but as it
once was.

When the Pitt undergraduates
were almost unanimously up-
per-middle class. when there
were few blacks. no "freaks."
and no state subsidies of tuition.
fraternities could set a tone of
life. for the few thousand under-
graduates. Those days. fortun-
ately I believe. are behind us.

What are fraternities today‘?
A fraternity is no more than the
individual member as he per-
ceives himself in relation to cer-
tain other men. No status. no re-
flected glory; simply a volun-
tary association with other men.
nothing more. nothing less.

What the individual member
derives from his fraternity affili-
ation is his own personal con-
cern. If a fraternity can be lab-
elled as being bigoted (and all
general labels are subject to
qualification) then it is only be-
cause there exist bigoted indi-
viduals who seek the company
of other like-minded people.

It is only if those students
interested in the Greek system
come to recognize a particular
fraternity as a discriminatory
organization and react against
this manner of thinking that then
a particular fraternity will fold

for lack of members. And even
if the organization will fold.
those particular members will
still retain their bigotry.

As fraternities are perceived
as having some type of inher-
ent status. a status which I be-
lieve is falsely applied. then the
fraternity system will be criti-
cized. And as it is criticized the
fraternity system will feel a
need to justify itself. Such pub-
lic display is unnecessary.

-As long as interested indi-
viduals are willing to affiliate
with fraternities. neither the
University administration nor’
the student community should
attempt to undercut fraternities
or to grant to the fraternities
privileges beyond those ac-
corded any other campus group.

A fraternity. it treated and
regarded as any other voluntary
group. will either fold or pros-
per because of itself. As bigot-
ed individuals ‘exist. so. will
bigoted organizations exist. As
worthwhile individuals exist.
so also will worthwhile or-
ganizations exist. Such is the
way of our society whether
good or bad._

Wednesday,

 

takeover of the so-called coun-
ter culture (Friday. October 23.
(The Pitt News), I agree em-
phatically:

Some friends and I are experi-
menting with different forms of
life-style values. including eco-
nomic ones. and it hurst to see
others who profess the same
ideals. yet can‘t spare the time

to practice them. \

One of the bright stars in an
otherwise cloudy sky is the New
Oakland Coop. Hopefully. this
will make fighting an exploita-
tive capitalist system “popular."

Perhaps blaming those who we
feel to be hypocrites is too sim-
plistic. though. It is obvious that
we have been too optimistic
about this counter culture. based
on the increase of long hair on
the campus. First. the campus is
a very biased sample in terms of
the entire population of the coun-
try. Second. we mustn't feel
that because something is sym-
bolic to us it should be sacred
to others. It is the nature of a
minority culture to be "Co-opted"
by the established majority. Ex-
ample: How long did the black-
originated phrase “Right On"
remain immune from TV adver-
tisements and billboards?

But whether the fault is with
the hypocrites among us or with
our own over-optimism is really

{Editor's Note: The following let-
~.= was sent to many administra-
we offices of the University last
‘éteek, in addition to the Chancel-
Ctr’-S. The BAS sponsored Black Week
exill be initiated on Nov. 9 and will
cs.-ntinue through the I4th. The
s::‘»;ited goal of Black Week is ac-
cording to one representative, “is
to involve the total community in
interaction and increase the social
and cultural activities of this cam-
pus in a manner more relevant to
Blacks.” In the letter Gamaliel Bal-
lard, the chairman of the Black Ac-
tion Society, asks the administra-
tion for a statement, which would
show their support of the activity.)

 ear Chancellor Posvar:

During the latter part of the
:=.mmer. the Black Action Socie-
 began grouping together vari-

am that would appeal to the cul-

‘There has been great need for
it-raving social events that appeal

and white. Now the stage has been
set and we are working hard to
..-ssure that this program will be
remembered! Remembered was
emphasized because this is our
first Black Week. This is the
maiden voyage. Therefore. condi-
tions should be arranged so that
Black people will want to continue
this program on a yearly basis.

Your cooperation can do much
to create the type of environment
that will accent the occasion. We
have planned a week of activities
which will include: Black alumni.
speakers. seminars. athletes and
entertainers. On Monday. Nov.9.
we have scheduled a full after-
noon of activities. Also. on Thurs-
day. Nov. 12. and again on Friday.
No. 13. our plans include a num-
ber of afternoon activities that
will be of interest to students.

As stated earlier. your cooper-
ation can do‘much. If yousupport
the plan. a statement would be
ideal because many students. fac-
ulty and administrators. Black
and white. are interested in the
program and would like to attend.
They are hesitant. tho. because
questions of class attendance have
been raised. Also. suggestions
were made that instructors dem-
onstrate a lenient class atten-
dance policy. especially during
those days that afternoon activ-
ities are scheduled.

Just a few years ago Planned
Parenthood obviously saw abor-
tion as a dangerous operation
which not only took the life of the
unborn child. but was detrimental
to the physical and mental health
of the mother. Today the official
policy of Planned Parenthood phy-
sicians is abortion on demand.

Glee Club Journeys
Springs

To Samtoga

The Men's Glee Club. 46 mem-

bers strong. will launch its annual
fall tour Friday.

Stopping at two eastern Penn-
sylvania high schools along the
way. the men will journey to Sar-
atoga Springs. N. Y.. where they
will join women from the Skid-
more College Chorus in concert.

The Glee Club will return to
Pittsburgh Sunday.

According to President Jim
Shear, the group is continuing this
year a trend begun last season.
“We're carrying onward an ex-
periment which started last
year,” Shear commented. “In all
_our performances, there will be
an accent on informality,“ he ex-
plained.

The second half" of the Glee
Clubs program. as it will be pre-
sented at Skidmore and locally
early next month. exemplifies this
spirit.

One of the second half‘s high-
lights is a staged version of "Who
Will Buy‘?“ from Oliver. While
soloists Jim Monahan. Jason
Feinman. and Bob Davis display
their talents. the rest of the group
dons costumes and presents a
skit. Some members drink crude-
ly upstage. while others. dressed
as English dandies. engage in
prim conversation. Still others.
suited as children. toss a ball back
and forth. creating a bright at
mosphere of diverse activities.

Also during the second half, a
new folkggroup will make its de-
but, performing “Scarborough
Fair“ and “When I Die.”

For the finale. Director Philip
Cavanaugh and Stage Director
Walt Cramer have worked up a
medley of "When Johnnie Comes
Marching Home" and "Momma

Look Sharp" from the Broad-
way musical 1776. “The message
of the finale is clear." President
Shear told the Pitt News, “and is
designed to have a specific im-
pact on the audience."

During the first half of their
program. the vocalists are slated
to present more traditional num-
bers. including "The Clam“ and
"The Mole"—two popular songs
which won the Glee Club prolong-
ed applause last year.

New selections to be perform-
ed include Ralph Vaughan Wil-
limas’ “All the Saints” and J. S.
Bach's “Death, 1 Do Not Fear
Thee.”

    

The Glee Club. the oldest extra-

curricular organization on cam-
pus. travels throughout the year
to colleges and universities in the
East. South. and Midwest. in ad-
dition to performing locally sev-
eral times per year.

The men have sung in recent
years at such schools as Vassar
College. Boston University and
the University of Virginia. Last
year. they traveled to Washing-
ton. D. C.. North Carolina. Michi-
gan apd Philadelphia for concerts.

The Glee Club will present a
concert at Carnegie Music Hall
Dec. 4at 8: 15 p.m.

just a little more polished than
in their more familiar settings
on daytime TV.

Cy Howard’s direction is
little better than that of the
average soap opera. The movie
looks like an opened-up stage
play, which it is. The dialogue
in Catholic families sounds like
dialogue used by Jewish fami-
lies (“Don't look for
happiness. It will only make you
miserable") Despite all of this
the picture is quite likeable.

Most of the credit must go to
the players. With the exception
of Gig Young, none is a “star”
Our unfamiliarity with an ex-
cellent cast makes them all the
more believable as real people.
Beatrice Arthur as a devout
churchgoer is especially fine. In
her innocent way she deals the
Church its most devastating blow
since Rene Auberjonois blessed
the jeep in MASH and made us
wonder what kind of eccentrics
were still in the fold.

Then there is Gig Young, Mr.

Suburbia, torturing himself, his

mistress, and logic in a desperate
effort to keep everyone happy.
For these beautiful moments
“Lovers and Other Strangers” is
worth seeing, but it would be

IA1'a’s Irish Squad
Next For Panthers

by ED CONLEY
Sports Editor

Panther followers probably expected something like a 43-13 ioss
against Notre Dame. looking ahead on the schedule. Thats why the
shock of last Saturdays 43-13 loss to Syracuse still lingers in the Cat
fans‘ thoughts as Carl DePasqua prepares his gridders for their game
against Ara Parseghians Irish this Saturday.

Against Syracuse the Panthers fell behind in the second quarter.
19-0. The Cats attempted a comeback a la the West Virginia victory a
few weeks ago as John Hogan returned to quarterbacking action and
fired the Panthers towards the end zone.

A 13-yard touchdown pass to Denny Ferris with one minute left in
the second quarter produced a 19-7 score and the Panthers gave the ap-

pearance that they could come
back as they did in the thrilling
36-35 win over West Virginia.

But Syracuse combined a blitz-
ing defense, ball control and four
second half touchdowns to pre-
vent a comeback. And the Pitt
five-game win streak, a top spot
in the Lambert voting and nation-
al ranking all disappeared.

The Panthers now have a 5-2
record. good enough for only sev-
enth place in the East. as Syra-
cuse's convincing win (they have
a 4-3 record» catipulted them to
second place. behind the Ivy
League leader Dartmouth. big
winners over contending Yale Sat-
urday. 10-0.

ls Syracuse 30 points better
than the Panthers‘?

“Any team that can put points
like they did against us on the
scoreboard, you have to give them
credit,” DePasqua told writers at
this week’s luncheon in the Ca-
thedral of Learning’s Babcock
Room. “Our biggest problem was
that we naturally lost our poise
and made mistakes as most teams
would when they get behind.”

Losing their poise when con-
fronted with a deficit on the score-
board was something new for the
Panthers. Besides the WVU come-

back. the Cats found themselves ‘

trailing at Baylor and Navy and
recovered for victories. Against

the Orange. though. the Panther’
_ attack couldn't find itself.

"I think overall - offensively
and defensively — I‘d have to say
that its one of those stinkers."
DePasqua concluded. "We didn‘t
have anyone who was outstand-
mg." g

The only other score for the
Panthers came after Bob Baierl
blocked a Syracuse punt and re-
covered on the Orange six-yard
line late in the fourth quarter.
Halfback John Moss ran around
right end for the touchdown.

Unfortunately for the Panthers.
the two scores weren't nearly
enough to impress a Liberty Bowl
onlooker. Bud Dudley. Both Pitt
and Syracuse could finish with 7-3
records this year. which would
merit further consideration by the
Liberty Bowl officials. The Pan-

a disadvantage off Saturdays
showing. I

To reach the 7-3 mark Syracuse
would have to win their remaining
games. . but the Panthers could
sustain a loss. Most experts think
that loss will come soon—-this Sat-
urday against Notre Dame. who is
so heavily favored that no odds
arelisted for the encounter.

There would have been odds had

the Panthers not been trounced by

Syracuse. But Notre Dame Coach
Parseghian says the large mar-
gin of defeat in New York hasn’t
changed his outlook on this week’s
game.

The Pitt booters returned from a successful en-
counter with Kent State to find themselves in the
running for a possible number four ranking in Dis-
trict2.

The booters are in contention with Bucknell.
Montclair State and West Chester for the number
four spot in the Pennsylvania-Delaware-New Jersey
selection group.

Penn State and Philadelphia Textile have se-
cured the number one and two spots.

The soccermen boost-
ed their record to 6-3
with their 4-0 shutout
against Kent State.

Coach Leo Bemis
praised his offense for
an outstanding job.

"We don‘t have any
one big scorer. but we
have a lot of guys who
can get in there and
shoot with authority.“

Earlier Bemis felt
that his offense needed
only confidence and
now he feels that they
are gaining their confi-
dence.

great scoring potential. He has had bad luck at scor-
ing this season. missing goals by inches. After the
first goal. the Coach believes. he will become a lit-
tle more confident and hit the net more consistently.

Randy Dry opened Pitt's offensive attack Satur-

‘ day with a first quarter goal, assisted by Len Raffa.

Tony Nicholakopoulous followed with a goal later
in the quarter.

Theofilos had his scoring spree in the "third quar-
ter. scoring first on an -assist from Nicholakopoul-
ous. Two minutes later he netted a second goal to
put the final score at 4-0.

The coach was also extremely pleased with the
performance of the defense.

“They did the job,” stated Bemis. “Kerry
(Krause) had some nice saves on balls that could
have been trouble.”

He also complimented the fullbacks and half-
backs on their defensive play. Due to their efforts
the Golden Flashes were unable to set up shots or
shoot with any authority.

The booters had their Tuesday match with Slip-

Excitement was high at Trees Pool last Thursday as Pitts wom-
ens varsity swim team crushed Chatham. 54-14.

The Pitt students have raced against some of the
better drivers in the nation during the last few
months. And the do-it-yourself. put-this-back-toge_th-

against autos with engines that cost their owners

Foreign Students’ Soccer

Team W]li[)S WVU Squad

The Pitt foreign students downed West Virginia's foreign students
team in an international soccer game. 6-1. at rain-drenched Moun-

taineer Field last Saturday.

The game. which was played on a wet Asti'o'l‘urf surface due to the
rain. saw West Virginias squad take an early 1-0 lead after the Pitt for-
eign students had failed to finish off several scoring opportunities. The
goal seemingly fired up the booters and they went on to score two quick

goals.

Scoring were Kwesi of Ghana
and Abu, who is from tiny Sierra
Leone. Their goals closed out the
scoring for the first half which
ended with Pitt holding a slim,
2-l,lead.

Any thoughts West Virginia had
of coming back in the second half
were quickly demolished by Obi. a
speedy Nigerian. who scored the
"hat trick" (three goals scored
consecutively) and then set up Ali

Fryer says.
at the thought that he
is, the little mouse who
dares to challenge the
big lions of the automo-
tive game.

“It’s a David and Go-
liath thing. For us to
compete in the realm of professional sports car
racing—with our age and no backing—-it is practi-
. incredible. What we’re try-
ing is a noble crusade in a higher order, if you know

sport and a sincere effort to gain some national
publicity for his University as the only school to ‘
back a car on the TransAmerican series. 3

The Camaro failed to win anything in two Trans- '
Am runs. but some degree of success on the Sports ._
Car Club of America tour. including a first place‘ A
last Sunday in a Warren. Ohio. A-Sedan race,”
breeds the feeling of a possible breakthrough. ’

Skeptics have felt that Fryer wants to use the ~
University name for his own gains. Mentioning that
to the road racer stirs his usually calm 3PDroac
towards discussing his venture. ’ *

"It‘s very simple." he says when asked to re-
fute the accusation. "Every penny we win goes di-’
rectly into making the car a better car. And each ,
member of the team pays his own expenses.

“I personally spend every cent I have. My qual—:i~'Vfi;

who want to help his crew. '

The mouse doesn't exactly hide in a hole on the...’

men‘! srunems

ln preparation for our ”OPEN HOUSE” on November l8. your Student Cabinet will present a
Series of three ads in the Pitt News regarding the Issue of Responsibility. The first, which fol-
lows, deals with the School of General Studies Responsibility to the Community in General and
its students in particular.

Gommuniiy

To begin with, we see a working relationship between the School of General Studies and the
Business Community as both desirable and necessary. We do not; hovever, see serving industry
as the primarv responsibility of the School lns tead, we feel that the School should strive to
serve the entire community, with a special emphasis on Development of Undergraduate Prob-

lems in fields such as Social Work and Public Affairs. The need for such programs in this ur-
ban setting is obvious.‘

The School of General Studies could serve as the vehicle for imaginative innovative programs
designed to help the entire university fulfill its commitment to Social Justice.

The School's responsibility to the student begin with his application for admission. Each new
student should be encouraged to seek professional testing at the beginning of his academic
career and the school should insure that these facilities are made readily available to,him.

The theme of assistance and encouragement should be a continuing one. For too long, the fan-
tastically high drop-out rate has been blamed on the insincerity and/or lack of drive and per-

' serverance of night students. Now, the school must share the blame for it has failed to produce
a climate conducive to education.

The school must examine the diverse needs of its students and must develop a variety of pro-
grams if it is to meet its responsibility. Students must be seen as individuals, each with a special

goal. The primary responsibility of the School of General Studies is to help the night school
student achieve his goal.

On November 18. our ”OPEN HOUSE” will be held between 7 and 11:30 in the Supper Room
of the Student Union. At this meeting we will discuss specific steps that the School of General
Studies could take in order to meet its responsibility. Please make plans to attend.
