Time is running out for Panther Prints

By Lisa McClendon
For The Pitt News

Yearbooks are a. tradition of high
schools and colleges across the
United States. Pitt’s yearbook, the
Panther Prints began in 1906, but its
future is questionable.

Last year, the number of seniors"

graduatingfrom Pitt was 3,159, but
only 500 yearbooks were sold. The

‘goal of the yearbook staff was to sell

at least 700 copies $35 a piece.

Pitt’s Publications Board, which
oversees the operations of the two
key media, Panther Prints and The
Pitt News, has the task of finding
solutions to the yearbook question. It
has a specific Panther Prints com-
mittee that is dedicated to keeping
track of the yearbook.

“The yearbook is facing the same
problems that a lot of yearbooks at
large universities in the United States
are facing, and that is a decline in
sales and maybe also a general
decline in interest,”
Waseleski, chair of. the Publications
Board. “We have to figure out why

said Tom _

that is and particularly why that’s the
case affecting Panther Prints.”

Stephanie ‘Mescall, editor of
Panther Prints, is trying to keep stu-
dents interested.

“A yearbook is a part of tradition.
and since Pitt is such a non-tradition-
al school, we fight tooth-and—nail to
get people in it,” Mescall said.

“We send letters to all the seniors
and all the freshmen because they’re
our target. And then we try to target
sophomores and juniors on campus.
We send mailings saying, ‘Hey! This
is your yearbook.”’ '

The yearbook budget, like many
university organizations, is lacking
sufficient funding to keep afloat. The
Publications Board, which receives
funding from student activities, has
covered the yearbooks losses for
many years. -

This year, Panther Prints had ‘a
budget of $45,897 and anticipates
having a deficit of $12,525. meaning
it had an income of about $33,000.

For 1996, which is the budget the
Publications Board just approved.
they’re prgiosing spending $46,480
with income of $38,550, for a pro-

jected deficit of $7,930. Again. that
is something the Publications Board
will have to cover if those figures
hold up, said Waseleski.

With the -lack of funding from the
university, the yearbook staff is
pulling out all the stops. This year
the staff will try telemarketing.

It will also try to get students more
involved by taking pictures for them-
selves or having photographers at

different ‘parts of campus to take pic- 6
tures of people with their friends.

pets or whatever.

With these new ideas. the staff
hopes to generate the interest and
revenue needed to keep the yearbook
running.

“We have been fighting with the
university for a while now trying to
get them to put it o_n the-registration
or send a notice out with the tuition
bill,” Mescall said. “We documented
evidence from other schools and uni-
versities. and this is how they do it."

Although the yearbook has been
under financial strain and interest is
not prevalent. the need to keep this
“memento” or “record" is strong. The

Students can help shooting victim

By Nicole Walz
£§uz[}'PV1iter

Pitt students have a chance to
help fellow student Kevin Cecil,
who was shot and paralyzed last
summer. A benefit ice skating
party has been planned for Dec. 4,
from 6:30 to 9 p.m. at the
Schenley ice skating rink.

“I don’t like asking people for
money without giving them some-

ithing in return,” said Adam

Butera, a co-chair for the Kevin
Cecil Benefit Committee. “That’s
why I think the skating fund—raiser
is a good idea.”

The committee has arranged for

vans to transport students to the

rink starting at 7:30 pm. Tickets
will be on sale at the William Pitt
Union Ticket Office starting
Monday. Prices of the student
tickets are $5 for singles and $8
for couples. Non-student. tickets
are $8 and $10. Refreshments will
also be served.

To date, smaller fund-raising
activities have brought in approxi-
mately $1,300, and the year-end
goal of the committee is $50,000.
This money will go to Cecil’s
expenses, such as a new specially
equipped van and renovations to
the Cecils’ two—story house.

The committee launched a can

recycling program earlier this _

year, but the project hasn’t been
nearly as successful as they had
hoped.

“A few fraternities and most
sororities have been really great
about turning cans in,” said co-

C chair Meegan Galie. “But.we’d
_ like to see more student groups get

involved, as well as the "residence
halls.”

The committee is also planning
a benefit concert for the spring,
which could possibly be an all-day
event. Butera said the plan is to
have a number of local bands per-
form. with an unnamed popular
band as the headliner. A corporate
dinner is also in the works.

“I just want the campus to get

involved to show that there is .

awareness and to show Kevin
there is support and that we
haven’t forgotten about him,” said
Butera.

Cecil was shot in July outside
Webster Hall, where he was walk-
ing a friend home, around 91:30

a.m. The shooting left him a quad-
riplegic.

A three—week search by Pitt and
city police resulted in the arrests
of three suspects in mid—August.
Two of the suspects are juveniles,
and the Allegheny County District
Attorney said they will be charged
as adults.

Police have said the motive for
the shooting was robbery. The sus-
pects, including the 12 year—old-
shooter, allegedly wanted money
to buy a 40 ounce bottle of beer.

Anyone interested in turning in
cans for the can recycling program
should contact Joel at 688-0313.

Kevin Cecil’s recovery started
out slowly, but in recent weeks
his condition has improved, and
he is even able to e-mail friends.

Cecil’s mother, Barbara, said
her son is “generally getting bet-
ter, and he’s gaining weight.”

Weight loss was a problem for
Cecil’ when he first went into
rehabilitation after he was shot
in the back on July 13, rendering
him a quadriplegic. 9
‘ His condition has stabilized
recently, and soon he might be
getting a power wheelchair.
Although Cecil isn’t in Oakland
he, is still participating inia pop-
ular activity for Pitt students ——

“He uses a head—controlled unit

said.

And on Dec. 1, Cecil, along
with 10 of his friends, will be on
the stage at Hershey Park with
the band, Phish, that recently
wrote a song for him.

His mother said he would defi-
nitely like to finish school, they
are just not sure if it will be at
I’itt.

“We might look into some
campuses that are better set up

for handicapped people,” she

said.

Cecil is expected to be out of
the rehabilitation center and able
to continue his recovery at home
by Dec. 11.

For 74 years Russia was a communist
country. Then, almost overnight, it was
thrown into capitalism, changing the coun-
try from a superpower to a global beggar.

Socially, a country accustomed to a dull
night life became a new center for gam-

bling, nightclubs and prostitution. These

kinds of changes have had great effects on
its citizens.

Alexander Prokhorov, a student at the
department of Slavic Languages and
Literatures, is happy with the way his coun-
try is changing. He claimed that when he
returned to Russia for a visit in May 1995,
he saw a vast display of cultural diversity
that was never allowed in communist
Russia.

“Previously, Russian books looked like
Russian clothing. Now they are diverse and
interesting books,” Prokhorov said.

In communist Russia, all books were of
the same ugly, grey color. and they all had
similar plots — communism, and the heroes
of communism, Prokhorov said.

Julia Sagaidak, another student at the
Slavic department, offered similar positive
comments on the Russian situation.

When asked why Russia is having such a
hard time in developing a stable democratic
country, she blamed it on the 74 years of
communism.

“Russian citizens are not experienced
enough in the democratic system and are not

prepared to take care of themselves. instead '

of depending on the government.” Sagaidak
said.

You couldn’t pick a better man to

Current SGB president Julie
Crowell was also enthused about
the number of voters.

“I’m overwhelmed with the
increase in voter turn—out,” Crowell
said. “We were apprehensive after
amending the poster rule, but it
only enhanced the turn—out.”

This year there was a new rule
that forbade candidates to display
individual election posters around
campus. The only posters that were
permitted were ones made up by
the Student Government Board,
featuring a picture and a brief state-
ment from all of the candidates run-
ning.

“I feel that the change in the
poster rule made being elected a
more attainable goal for the whole
campus community,” said Crowell.

“The race was excellent, and the
turn—out was great,” said Mike
Fuller. “I’m very happy for Andy.

I’m confident with the president. I
feel that SGB will continue to move
in the right direction,” she said.

Leiter and Marc Friedberg were
the other two members, including
Wuertele, of the “Reinvention”
slate. Friedberg came in third in the
race for board. .

“I believe voters accepted the
validity of the vision I expressed,”
said Wuertele in response to all
three members of the slate being
elected. “People think experience is
very important.”

The three members of the board-
elect with the highest number of
votes will serve on the Senate
Council, along with the SGB presi-
dent. The Senate Council consists
of faculty and students and is one
of the top decision—making bodies
in the university.

Keith Campbell, the only incum-
bent board member, came in second
place and will serve on the
Senate Council.

“I’m glad I made the Senate
Council. I can negotiate issues
better,” said Campbell. “I’m
ready to go in and fight for
issues like a student trustee (a
student who would sit on the
trustee board) and higher edu-
cation funding.” ,

“Campbell worked his way
from being number eight in the
board election to being num-
ber two this year," said
Wuertele. “He deserves every
vote he received.”

Wuertele said his first prior-
ity as SGB president is to

with their individual needs.

 City pools in too deep

Get out your bathing suits, your suntan lotion and your
sh-ades. What, it’s snowing outside? Yeah, we know. But if
you don’t“suit up to jump into one of the city’s pools now,
you may not be able to next year.

According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Pittsburgh
City Council is considering shutting down 16 of the city’s
32 public pools. This measure, according to the article in
yesterday’s paper, will save the city around $500,000; it
may also be the only way to maintain the bottom line of
Mayor Murphy’s budget of $321.7 million.

If you were around this area last summer, you may
remember the ridiculously hot weather we had for a while
— anywhere from 95 to 102 degrees for a few weeks in a
row. That would be the perfect weather to go swimming,
right? A lot of people went for a dip when the weather got

 - . that hot.

Bright, sunny, hot —— no better time to jump into a pool
to cool off. A lot of people thought this last summer,
except the lifeguards who the city employed to staff its

ools.

P On probably the hottest day of the year last summer, sev-
eral lifeguards just didn’t bother to show up for work. The
city excused this with a slap on the wrist. “They’re
teenagers, you can’t really rely on them anyway,” or, “You

I . can’t blame them, it gets hot sitting in those lifeguard

chairs all day.”

While it does indeed get hot sitting in a lifeguard chair,
there is absolutely no excuse for not showing up for work.
That they were teenagers is no excuse either. Lifeguards
are responsible for keeping people alive, and if they can’t
be counted on to show up for work, they can hardly be
counted on to save lives. ,_ I

‘It may seem ironic that we’re complaining about pools
and lifeguards when it’s below freezing outside. But with
the threat of the year’s first winter storm the other day,
consider another set of possibilities. The city’s budget has
fallen pretty low, so ‘in order to save money, council is

-going to shut down half of its plowing equipment. In order

to cut costs, Pittsburgh’s icy roads will be coated -with ash
instead of salt. And topping it all off, several of the people

_in charge of winter road maintenance decided it was too

cold to go to work, so they stayed home. Oh well, what
could you expect? It was cold out!

This might seem ridiculous, but it goes to prove the
twisted logic behind the (Tim _Council’s reasoning. The city

I might find it easier to manage its money and keep the pools

open if it managed the people whowork for them. The life-
guards who didn’t bother to show should have been fired
on the spot. i

If the city’s pools shut down, city officials had better be

A ' prepared to deal with a lot more idle kids hanging around

with nothing to do. Everyone complains about juvenile
crime and delinquency, but one by one recreational facili-
ties and opportunities are being taken away from kids.

A dedication to Bosnian prisoners

Hello. I speak to you from
my residence here in
Pittsburgh, where I am recu-
perating from wounds inﬂicted
upon me at a Serbian concen-
tration camp. I am a veteran
soldier and ranking officer in
task-force 103 of the United
Nations Peacekeeping Guard. I
was asked by your university
to give you my feelings on the

‘UN. at 50, but I have decided

to divert the attention of my
story to the genocidal atroci-
ties occurring in Bosnia-
Herzegovina.

Having just read today’s edi-
tion of The New York Times,
the world would seem to be in
a state of relative peace this
morning. One of the headlines
in today’s newspaper high-
lighted a small town in Kansas
where Russian and American
military troops coexist togeth-
er. There in that small town the
two former rivals live together
in the same barracks, practice
maneuvers together as a single
unit and teach each other their
language and customs. This
new camaraderie is representa-
tive of both the peace we find
in our sheltered superpower
and the relative diplomatic
harmony found today all
throughout our world. What is
this multinational force prepar-
ing for in an international state
of non-belligerence? They are
preparing for-an invasion of a
region known as “K—Town.”

Through both mock exercis-
es with re-creations of the land
mines and buildings and an
extensive education in the cul-
tural, religious and ethnic
backgrounds they will find in
“K-Town,” they have ineffect
recreated the region of the real
“K-Town” — Bosnia-
Herzegovina. Yes. Bosnia.
Serbia. Croatia. Land of geno-
cide, civil war, ethnic cleans-
ing and a disillusioned popula-
tion perpetually mourning its
slain fellow countrymen.

In addition to a fresh contin-
gent of U.N. peacekeepers,
20,000 of our finest NATO

Daniel
Weiss

troops — mostly Americans
— will be sent to this troubled
land of hostility, hate and grief
to put an end to a murderous
bout of ethnic cleansing. Here
in this foreign land the troops
will encounter a war of his-
toric proportions; if they are
able to locate the secluded
Serbian concentration and
extermination camps, they will
bear witness to the most
extreme form of genocide
since Hitler’s Holocaust.

The NATO troops and the
uninformed international pop-
ulace to whom they will relate
their movements and experi-
ences will both be shocked to
learn that such camps still
exist on our planet. People the
world over will organize hot-
lines and charities in a mass,
rapid campaign to raise money
for the victims’ families and to
assist in the search and convic-
tion of the Serbian generals.
However, it will be too late.
Right now there is a holocaust
going on in Bosnia-
Herzegovina. Thousands of
Bosnian Muslims are perishing
in the same isolation and in the
same conciliatory conditions
that Hitler constructed and
maintained in his concentra-
tion camps!

I have been home for the
past six months and read only
secluded accounts of these
atrocities. It would be an
equally abominable crime of
humanity if the media has
intentionally evaded covering
the genocide in detail.
Occasionally, a newspaper
may publish a headline ascer-
taining vague details of mass
murder in the region. Yet
never are the details published
in the graphic imagery, that
with which the Holocaust has
been described to capture the
reader’s attention and sympa-
thies. It is true that the geno-
cide we find in Bosnia-
Herzegovina today is on a
much smaller scale than

Hitler’s Holocaust, but it is the
principle that concentration
and extermination camps still
exist which should be most
disturbing to us.

While serving in Bosnia-
Herzegovina, I was captured
by the Serbs and thrown into
one of their tortuous concen-
tration camps. I was lucky
enough to escape. I was lucky
enough not to have been
deported to some isolated
ravine, blindfolded and then
shot to death in the machine-
gun executions the Serbs use
as low-cost, makeshift exter-
mination camps. Right now,
thousands upon thousands of
Bosnian Muslims are being
coercively forced by the Serbs
to perform 18 hours of tortu-
ous labor a day on meager
rations. Then they are packed
together at night in unsanitary,
unlivable cells to serve out
their death sentences. There
the prisoners remain, day after
day, night after night. There in
those cells they envision
malignant portraits of the fear-
ful things to come at night;
they hallucinate colors, vitality
and aspirations in the burning
sun of day. And so, there in
those foreign, mysterious con-
centration camps operating at
this very second, the unliberat-
ed prisoner sits in constant
fear, chained in his own
despair; a crumpled heap in a
dark and lonely world, a pris-
oner of human neglect, antipa-
thy and persecution.

(Author’s Note: This is a dedi-
cation to Bosnian Muslims,
Bosnian Croats, and U.N.
Peacekeepers imprisoned in
Serbian concentration camps.
Parts of this narrative are fic-
tional and were based upon
actual accounts by Bosnians

‘who were either released or

escaped from the Serbian con-
centration camps. The author’s
portrayal of certain environ-
ments may not be entirely

Kevin

inter is here, and with
 it, all sports fans’
hearts turn to one
thing—money.

Yes, there’s the excitement of
NFL late—season Snow Bowls.
OK, college basketball can revi-
talize the school spirit. And
yeah, the NBA and NHL start to
pick up, but it all leads back to
money.

Right about now, serious
sports gamblers are coming out
from under their rocks, throwing
away their football pools and
fantasy stats and searching for
the. almighty Lock. _

So for all you bettors (who
I’m sure bet responsibly, are
over 21 years old, and ﬂy out to
Vegas to make the wager legal-
1y) 2 5
_I have one. And, as a bonus, it’s
in our own backyard.

Here’s the deal —- mortgage
the house, sell off the stock,
hock the furniture, delay the
tuition payment and throw down
all your cash on the Pitt Panthers

’ to upset West Virginia next
Friday.

Don’t laugh. There are many
logical, sensible reasons why
Pitt will defeat the
Mountaineers.

Unfortunately, I can’t think of
any. Let’s face it, after eight loss-
es in a row, no one in his or her
right mind would bet the
Panthers to cover against a
school for the blind.

But as any good gambler will
tell you, little facts like records,
statistics, injuries and momen-
tum mean nothing. The key, as
always, is the Trend, which goes
hand in hand with the Lock —
and what a trend it is.

Pitt football has been on a bit
of a downtum over the past ﬁve
years. In fact, the squad has fin-
ished under .500 in four of those
years, mustering only three wins
in each season. Also, the team
has lost eight games in each of

K the past two campaigns.

Ferencik is a finalist for kicking award

Freshman
placekicker one
of five finalists
for annual Lou

By Mike Kovak
Asst. Sports Editor

Pitt freshman placekicker Chris Ferencik has been
selected as one of five finalists for the Lou Groza
Award, which is presented annually to the top placekick-
er in the country.

Ferencik, who was named Pitt’s starting placekicker
the day before the Panthers’ season-opening victory
against Washington State, is the only freshman ﬁnalist
for the award. _

“I am honored to be a ﬁnalist for such a prestigious

award” Ferencik Said‘ “The fact I am only a freshman Pitt’s freshman placekicker Chris Ferencik is a finalist for the Lou

makes it a great honor just to be mentioned with the top
placekickers in the country.”

Ferencik has converted on all 12 of his ﬁeld-goal attempts this
season, with a long of 41 yards. He is the only placekicker rated in
the top 50 in the nation to be perfect on field—goal attempts.

In addition to his perfection on ﬁeld goals, Ferencik has convert-
ed 23 of 24 point after touchdown attempts, with the miss coming
in the 29-27 loss to Temple.

“Ferencik has had an outstanding year for our football team and is
very deserving of this recognition,” Pitt head coach Johimy Majors
said.

Currently, Ferencik ranks ﬁrst in the Big East Conference in kick
scoring with 59 points, also good for 13th in the nation. His 59
points also rank second in overall scoring in the conference behind

The Lady Panthers travelled to Ohio
State to partake in the evening’s fes-
tivities and are headed back to
Pittsburgh with an 85-50 defeat
courtesy of the Lady Buckeyes.

Pitt led only once in the game.
Senior guard Stephanie Petho hit an
18-foot jumper from the left side at
the 12:54 mark of the ﬁrst half to
give the Lady Panthers a 10-9
advantage.

Petho was Pitt’s leading scorer,

in double ﬁgures, with 15. She had
11 of the team’s 25 f11st—half points.
A Petho also grabbed four rebounds.

up to number one.

“When you play number one,
like I did the past two years,
you get to play the best player
from each school. You get to
see a lot of good talent, and it
makes you better because there
is never an easy match. The
experience I got from playing
number one in the past has
helped me improve,” Baker
said. 6

This year she is in the three
spot, and she had a 5-2 record
for the fall season.

“Alison is a very consistent
player,” head coach George
Dieffenbach said. “She came in
as a freshmen and played well
and has improved every year.
With her at number three, it
adds a tremendous amount of
depth to our team, which
helped us to our 6-2 record this
fall.”

This year Baker is a senior
tri~captain. About this, she said,
“I’m a captain, but everyone
gets along, so there really isn’t
just one leader.”

“She’s been a leader for four
years and is a good example to
the younger players, because
she works hard,” Dieffenbach
said. '

Teammate Erin Shalbrack, a
freshman, added, “Everyone
gets along with her. She is very
supportive of the team.”

As a senior at Loyalsock
,High School in Williamsport,
Pa., Baker was recruited by
other schools before choosing
Pitt, and she said her choice
was made when she met coach
Dieffenbach. ,

“I came because of the coach,
because he showed me around
Pittsburgh. I liked the campus,
and he seemed really under-
standing. He knows what it is
like to be a player and a stu-
dent, so I decided on coming

here,” Baker said.

Being a student-athlete is no
easy task. In Baker’s case she
has three—hour practices five
days a week with her classes
scheduled before and after.
Then there are the weekend
meets that take away all her
weekends. She also has a job at
the Cost Center that takes up an
additional 10 hours a week.

“Without being an athlete it
would make things a lot easier
for me over the past four years.
I would have a more relaxed
schedule and more time for
myself,” Baker said.

“There are some good things
about playing tennis here. I like
playing for the school and get-
ting the sense of school pride
when you win a match. It’s neat
because I get to go to places
I’ve never been before.
Sometimes it’s good to get
away from the city atmosphere
and see different kinds of cam-
puses, like Princeton,” Baker
said.

Baker got her start in tennis
at the age of 13. Her parents
played, and she got interested
and began taking lessons at the
local racquet club. From there
she competed in tournaments
and tried to get ranked. She
excelled in high school tennis
and was recruited by Pitt with a
half—scholarship.

After graduating from school '

in August, this 21-year-old
political science major is hop-
ing to be a tennis coach at the
college level. Dieffenbach is
currently looking for openings
for her.

“I would love to coach,”
Baker said. “I would like to
start out at a small school and
then end up at a larger school.”

The fall season is over, and
tennis won’t start up again until
spring. At this time of the year,
Baker is required to run, lift
weights and play on her own.

meaningless upset since, well,
that_ Temple game a few weeks
back.

Forget the 42-10 blowout last
week. Forget Johnny Majors’
statement that the team was
“totally dominated” by
Syracuse. Forget that the last
time Pitt won a game, Zelda’s
was a citation—free freshman
haven, and fratemities actually
wanted to make the newspaper.

Forget all that and play the
Trend. The Trend will show you
the way.

Not convinced? There’s more.

The past two seasons, your
Pitt Panthers (if you’ll admit
ownership) have gone into their
last game with a 2-8 record.

‘Each year they stumbled into it,
losing the game before to a
ranked opponent in the Big East
And both years, they won, beat-
ing Temple in 1993 and besting

Rutgers in ‘94.

This year, the team is 2-8. It
stumbles into‘ West Virginia after
letting Syracuse wipe the
Astroturf with the Pitt defense.
By the way, Syracuse is a card-
canying Big East Member and

is ranked 23rd in the Associated

Press poll.

Bingo. Why bother with try- ‘
ing to ﬁgure out which team
plays better on natural grass
after an away loss following a
road win on the third Thursday
night of each month with an “r”
in it, when you can play scientif-
ic trends like this one? Besides,
it’s more scientiﬁc than trying to
ﬁgure out the next NFL upset
victim, or which NHL or NBA
team is "going to care about an
early-season game when half the
league makes the playoffs.

Still not convinced?

As you know, the biggest
spread-buster- in football games
is the last-rninute, meaningless
ﬁeld goal. When a team is down
by a few touchdowns, some
coaches will decide to kick a
ﬁeld goal for no real reason
other than to put points on the
board and pad the statistics of
the placekicker, if he would hap-
pen to be up for some kind of
award.

Strangely enough, in Pitt’s
loss to Syracuse, Majors opted
for a fourth quarter ﬁeld goal to
cut the Orangemen lead down to
42-10. Kicker Chris Ferencik is
up for the Lou Groza Award and
could use all the points he can
get. He also has the accuracy
and leg strength to win a game
(or cover a spread) with a last-

. minute boot from anywhere

inside 45 or so yards.

Even the kicking game is sid-
ing with this one, folks. There is
no escape from the Trend.

If you’re still not convinced,
don’t bet. Go feed the hungry or
start a trust fund or do whatever
it is non-gamblers do with their
money. The rest of us will be
savoring the winnings for
‘weeks.

Until we lose them all on the
next Trend.

I Am Cuba
Directed by Mikhail Kalatozov

Lush scenery, dizzying cam-
erawork and poetic writing
make Kalatozov’s I Am Cuba a
buried treasure worthy of
unearthing. But the heavy sym-
bolism and unabashed bias are
constant reminders that the film
is~a relic of 1960s Marxist-
Leninist propaganda and the
foiled optimism of the Cuban
Revolution.

Set in pre-revolutionary Cuba,
the film is a series of snapshot

-stories filled with pain and con-

tradiction that build up to a dra-
matic, valiant ending, that we
know is the very beginning. It
contrasts widespread poverty
with riches of the few (and the
foreign), poses political hege-
mony against the hopes of the
people. Celebrating the dream
of an egalitarian society in the
tradition of Sergei Eisenstein’s
political cinematic language, I
Am Cuba is set in a time when
Cuba was under the thumb of
the brutal, oppressive ‘Batista

 ‘ ' regime and largely controlled by_

U.S. investors and politicians.
There are patches of beauty
and hope throughout, even in
places where hope shouldn't
grow. A fallen angel in a
Havana slum rents herself to an

9.}-% American businessman for a
 night, but not before she waters
 'a tiny plant she keeps in the
 "‘windowsilI. Later, an old sugar

cane grower finds out that after

h ’ a lifetime of perpetual debt, the

land he farms has been bought
out by the infamous United Fruit
Company. He looks distressed,
and his son asks if he is tired.
Full of rage, he screams to his
children and to the sky,-“!No
estoy cansadol lNo estoy

; cansado!” (‘‘I am not tired!”)

Conspicuous symbolism is a
constant reminder that this is a
film with an agenda. Poverty
and wealth are contrasted
throughout, and if you are a
gung-ho American patriot, pre-
pare to be offended. The sym-
bolism goes over the top toward
the end, but it isappropriate to
the style of the film.

More artistic than the specific
and topical political messages,

the looks, sounds and words of
the film are impeccable. Sergei
Urusevsky’s cinematography is
stunning, turning the film into
visual poetry and hyperbole

’ with delirious hand-held shots,

creative use of fish-eye lenses
and filters, and shots from won-
derfully disorienting angles. The
camera swoops around the out-
door deck of a beachfront resort
and even takes a dip in the
pool. It follows a dancer and her
possessed gyrations to a fiery
African rhythm, and the night-
marish, swirling nightclub crowd
gawking and urging her on. it
glides over the verdant beauty
of the coastline and the Sierra

Maestra mountains. It intimately.

records the fear, joy, anguish
and glory in the exaggerated
acting. ’
The musical score by Cuban
composer Carlos Farihas is rich
and surreal as well. Jazz high-
lights much of the film, with

 

compositions that begin with-a
tight, up-tempo feel but eventu-
ally follow the scenes’ degener-
ation into confusion and disso-
nance. Stylistically fitting and
beautifully done, this is not your
usual background noise.

The original Spanish and the
Russian voice-overs also add to
the auditory pleasure. The
script was co-written by Soviet
poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko and
Cuban poet Pineda Barnet, and
the film is sectioned off with five
short poems that highlight the
action. The poems are beautiful
in English, but flow more natu-

llhriﬁ(.Luz ria Colazo) inarxist

   

  

rally in Spanish and Russian.
They are read exquisitely and
with emotion by two mellifluous
female voices, and the exoti-
cism of the foreign languages
make the English subtitles
seem even clunkier. My only
regret is that the Spanish
couldn’t be left intact beside,
instead of under, the Russian
voice-over. '

Until afew years ago, the film
was never seen outside of
Cuba and the Soviet Union. I
Am Cuba crystalized the hope
that Castro's revolution repre-
sented to the people of Cuba

classic frozen in time,

   

 

I Am uba" 
and true believersin Marxist-

Leninism. Although that dream ‘

has since been pretty much
squashed (and Castro was
never really a Marxist-Leninist),
I Am Cuba is a vivid museum
piece well worth the trip. it is
artful enough to be inspiring at

times, but slanted enough to-

remind you that you are being
made to feel inspired.

"/ Am Cuba” will run Fri., at the
Harris Theater, 9:15, Satfat the
Hex, 2:15, and Sunday at the

Love and Human Remains
Djrected by Denys Arcand

. (Canada, 99 min.)

Arcand’s first film in English is a
provocative portrayal of the search for
love and_meaning by young urban hip-
sters. The story centers around two
roommates; cynical, ex-TV sitcom star
who is now a waiter because it is “more
artistically satisfying,” and Candy, an
ever-hopeful book reviewer. Through
work and play, their lives connect in
funny, often poignant, and sometimes"
menacing ways with a serial killer in
their midst. Harris: Thu Nov 16 @ 7, Fri

sions. For in 1991 Vukovar. Yugoslavia,
there is no time for joy and no time for

Latcho Drom

I Directed by Michel Negroponte

(USA, 78 min.)

Latcho Drom is neither a documentary
nor a fiction film. It is a musical that tells
the story of the historic odyssey of the
Gypsies from India to Egypt. Gatlif’s
magical shots bring the audience so
easily from the present of the Gypsies to
their past that they (the audience) expe-
rience a timeless reality. Melwood: Thu

. Living in Oblivion

Directed by Tom DiCiIlo
(USA, 91 min.)
Living in Oblivion teeters somewhere

between Kafka and the Marx Brothers. It

is the story of independent film director
Nick (Steve Buscemi) and the movie he
is trying to make. Aided by a faithful
crew — a ragtag collection of dreamers
and wannabes — Nick deals with two
explosions, two nervous breakdowns,
one upset stomach, two seductions,

, ’ eight dreams, one broken heart, one
. _ fistfight, four goatees, a neurotic beauti-

ful leading lady and, finally, a leading
man who is a star in his own mind.

Teaserama and Dance Hall Racket
daring Double Feature from the 50’s”

This campy, somewhat sleazy, but _

wonderful double feature was consid-
ered risque adult entertainment in the
early 50's. In Teaserama, the legendary
pin-up Betty Page is exposed by her
notorious husband, photographer and
publisher Irving Klaw. Although featuring
Page, this fully restored film is a com-
pendium of burlesque acts of the time,
with stripper Tempest Storm, female
impersonator Vickie Lynn, comic Joe E.
(“Oooh, ooh”) Ross (of “Car 54, Where
Are You?) and others. Lenny Bruce and
his real-life stripper wife Honey Harlow
star in Dance Hall i-iacket, an obscure
exploitation film about white-slavery that
was directed by Phil Tucker. Adults

The Last Goodtime
Directed by Bob Balaban
(USA, 90 min.)

Retired violinist, Joseph, is content in
his retired life visiting his old friend
Howard, and avoiding the advances of

his next door neighbor Ida. He also rec- -

ollects the sensuous dancehis late wife
once did for him 50 years ago in front of
a fireplace. The Last Goodtime is a film
about overcoming the barriers of age,
sex and the possibility of change at any
point in life. Rex: Fri Nov 17 @ 5:30,

City Unplugged
Directed by llkka Jarvilaturi
(Finland/USA/Estonia/Sweden, 99 min.)

City is a hard~boi|ed, claustrophobic
caper movie  but with a twist. The
movie comes out of the newly restored
republic of Estonia, and the writer and
director decide to throw punches of
humor where they never could before —
Mother Russia no longer calls the shots.
Showing wry contempt, City, is about
some appalling Russian mobsters trying
to steal gold from Estonian coffers. Rex:

When Pigs Fly
Directed by Sara Driver
(USA/Germany/Japan, 94 min.)

In the tradition of Topper and The
Caterville Ghost, this film is a dreamy,
whimsical, sometimes dark tale about a
pair of ghosts, a jazz musician, a go-go
dancer and a guy who gets what’s com-
ing to him. For those willing to tune into
its dreamy wavelength, it is a magical
opportunity to reach moments of poetic
epiphany rarely experienced in film.

Art For Teachers of Children
Directed by Jennifer Montgomery
(USA, 82 min.)

Jennifer Montgomery’s bravely autobi-

selor, who’s into photographing his stu-
dents.. Harris Theater: Sat Nov 18 @

and his wife researching the Sephardic
origins of William Shakespeare. The trail
leads to the library of an ancient, isolat-

On the third day He rose
again from the dead show, and
on Monday; the fourth day, the
Lord commanded Tim Kaulen
to REMOVE his Decoy 2 from
the front steps. of the Carnegie
Museum whilst His Holy
International Festivities raged
on within the building.”

Here’s the scene:

Last Monday night, around
6:30:

I’m not sure just where they
came from (Fox Chapel
wouldn’t be a bad guess), but
what appears to be thousands
of ugly-looking rich old ladies
and their sharp-dressed male
companions file past the front
steps of the Carnegie, pulling
their dead animal pelts closer
to themselves, attempting to
keep warm. They cast con-
fused, and occasionally fright-
ened glances toward the five
young bundled up men who
scurry around the souped up
trailer/bird parked in their way,
the one that the Tribune
Fleview reported had mysteri-
ously landed there.

“Oh, myl” says one old lady,
“Did you see that thing,
Honey?”

“See what, Dear?” asks her
husband, attempting to light his
pipe in the brisk wind.

“That  thing back there  it

“No, I didn’t see anything,”
says the guy, without looking
back.

Here comes our next group
of potential art critics, apparent-
ly two couples out for the
evening in all their evening fin-
ery.

Lady #1 to Lady #2: “What is
that thing? Do you think that it’s
a part of the lnternational?”

“Oh, no!”

Husband # 1: “Whatever it is,
it sure is UGLY!”

Husband #2: ‘‘It’s a piece of
shit alright.”

A little boy and a little girl
walk past with their mother.
They, point to the sculpture,
excited.

“Mommy, look, there’s the
dinosaur from the park!”

“Oh yeah, the dinosaur.
That’s nice, isn’t it?”

The park referred to is Mellon
Park, also the front lawn of the
Pittsburgh Center for the Arts in
Shadyside, where One Decoy
and Decoy 2 have been on dis-
play for about six months.‘/Obs
Decoy was originally installed
on the lawn as part of the
Center’s biennial.

The 1995
international is supposed to be
one of the two or three most
impressive exhibitions of con-
temporary art in the United»
States this year. There is sup-
posed to be an International
every two years, although this
time it’s been three years since
the last show, which contained
a tremendous amount of
ground-breaking installation
work. More than a few of the
“contemporary” artists included
in the show this year are dead.
Tim Kaulen decided to drop off
one of his large sculptures out-
side the museum, just in time
for the show.

But officially sanctioned
spaces have never exactly
been Kaulen’s specialty. Much
of his. work has graced aban-
doned industrial sites in
Pittsburgh for years.

‘‘I did some photography in
different industrial sites, but I

walked away unsatisfied that I
didn’t really interact with the
space,” says Kaulen.

He then found a more suit-
able means of “interaction” —
spray paint. Influenced by
street-painters, not graffiti boys
with no style, Kaulen found
interesting places that seemed
to be neglected by the property
owners — the old Soldiers and
‘Sailors construction site, for
instance — and marked them
with stencils of a design that
developed from “wacky, crude-
looking" goose decoys that his
grandfather used to make.

Kaulen", a member of the
Brew House Association, is
hesitant to align himself with
the majority of taggers out
there, pissing out territory like
dogs.

“Most of it is really just shit;
there’s no responsibility in it.”

He's also not happy with the
way the Tribune-Fieview inter-
preted his decision to drop off
Decoy 2, uninvited, in time for
the Carnegie International.

“They said something about
my piece being a statement on
behalf of all the disenfranchised
artists of Pittsburgh, which real-
ly wasn't my intention at all,”
says Kaulen.

“The International is really a
great event,” he continues in
his soft-spoken, yet earnest
way. ‘‘I just wanted to contribute
something, to add to it. I mean I
don’t have some huge founda-
tion with a million dollars, I just
have a couple of pieces. I don’t
feel it was a distraction at all. I
just wanted to welcome those
international people, to let them
know that something is going
on here in Pittsburgh.”

So an offering was made,

Little Drummer Boy-style, and
Friday night, Nov. 3, during the
Artists’ Reception, the single-'
most prestigious opening of the
weekend (there were several),
eight anonymous folks, known
as the Industrial Arts Co-op,
famous for having constructed
the Space Monkey and other
urban jungle creatures in the
past, pulled Decoy 2 up onto
the curb in front of the muse-

- um.

“l told everyone just to act
like they belonged there,” says
Kaulen. “We had one guy who
was supposed to be the project
manager, holding a clipboard,
in order to fend off the first
wave of heat, if it happened.
But no one tried to stop us. We
directed the traffic around us
and handled everything in an
official—looking manner.”

The next day, Kaulen
dropped off a letter for
Carnegie Head Curator Richard
Armstrong, ostensibly the per-
son responsible for this year’s
relatively tame (rhymes with
lame) show. It was similar to a
letter he’d given to Pittsburgh
Center for the Arts Curator
Murray Horne when he
dropped off the second decoy
without being asked to over the
summer.

“They didn’t know the second
one was coming. I sent Murray
a letter saying that a rare
species of bird had migrated to
the lawn, and that our surveil-
lance team was monitoring the
mating habits of the two birds.
He was pretty receptive to it.”

“The letter I gave Mr.
Armstrong Saturday basically
said that the bird is docile and
playful, and not a threat to the
public, and that I would take full

 

responsibility for it.”

Tow trucks called onto the
scene Friday night refused to
touch the piece, which needed
to be disassembled in order to
be removed. They were appar-
ently afraid to be responsible
for any possible damage to the
piece.

Armstrong called Kaulen
Sunday and said, “Someone
has parked one of your pieces
in front of the museum. After
the end of the day Monday, we
cannot ensure its safety.”

Kaulen remains optimistic,
‘‘I’m really impressed by Mr.
Armstrong's reaction to me. it
could have been a whole lot
worse. I'm sure he might have
said things behind my back that
would have hurt my feelings,
but he was pretty nice on the
phone?

“l don’t want to be considered
a party crasher. That's kind of
yucky. But if people think I'm
just trying to rock the boat, then
maybe they do need to re-
adjust their acceptance levels.”

Kaulen’s plans for the imme-
diate future are mostly centered
around his upcoming show at
the Lascaux Gallery on the
South Side. As usual, certain
elements of his show will be a
collaborative effort with local
visual artists, musicians and
writers.

“Things were kind of slow for
a while, but this museum trip
has definitely got things moving
again.”

Tim Kaulen’s exhibition will
run from Dec. 2 until the end of
the year at the Lascaux
Gallery, South Side. 488-0509.

a town called Pittsburgh can
there be a hint of that sweet
red-white-and-blue in the form
o_f a back-woods bar called
Gooski’s. Smashed between
row houses on a residential
decline in an urban setting,
that's GOO-SKl’s, an inbred
subliminal mesh spawned from
nicknames of the two respec-
tive owners Dave Paul (G00)
and John Skiatas (SKI).

Here is where you find your
local rockabilly underground,
dive‘-bar-breeding and primal-
urge-producing catalyst.
Gooski’s is a place for those
like myself who become nau-
seous at the thought of preppy
girls who actually shave their
legs and jock—filled tandems
reeking of self-fulfilled insecuri-
ties.

Walk into Gooski’s on any
Saturday night and your eyes
will feast upon the wide selec-
tion of freaks sans normality

that collides after 11. Shaved‘

heads, old men, hairy girls, riot
grrrrls and pompadours galore
shimmy and shake in that old-
school, lounge-lizard style.
Your eardrums feel the dead
pulse of pounding drums and
deep bass reaching from the
band in the far back of the bar.
The floor leading to the stage in
the back is pure ‘50s-checker-

board style. The ceilings are
held up by running boards
which twist and turn around the
corners.

If it weren’t for the immense
amount of liquor lining the wall
behind the bar, one could easily
mistake this place for Arnold's
Drive-In. You might even find
yourself ordering up a frosty
milkshake to wash down that
Iron. Of course the bathroom is
well within running distance,

an offering. And if you don’t,

there is always time to hang out

From the outside, Gooski’s
looks like that country bar

grandkids to in the innocence of
youth. I expect the guy with the
long hair and the carpenter's
crack and his toothless girl-

They do not.

Actually, Gooski’s is deceiv-

make way for a pool table and
a dartboard. A huge graffiti

James is not your ordinary
service bartender, and he's cer-
tainly no politician of correct-
ness. His staple bowling shirts
and Elvis cut are the perfect
backdrop for his favorite form of
expression. James is the F-
word king.

‘‘If you fucks fucking help
yourself, I'll fucking kill you,” are
the first words I hear when I roll
up to the bar. I expect him to
ask,”Who the fuck are you?"
when I sit down to talk to him.
He really lets me down when
he does not say this and calmly
asks me what I want.

After doing time in a rockabil-
Iy band called The Rowdy
Bovines, James decided about
a year ago to start bartending
for supplemental income. Is it
coincidence that he applied at
the only bar around with a huge
rockabilly selection on the juke-
box? I don’t think so. In fact,
James not only plays in rocka-
billy bands and works at
Gooski’s, he organizes huge
rockabilly festivals that can last
whole weekends.

“I promote the shows and
usually break even. I basically
do it for fun. This is just a cool
dive bar where people just
come to hang out,” he says.

The bar is located in Polish
Hill, which means you have to
have transportation to get
there. You'll be able to locate it
immediately as soon as you
realize that you are lost on a
shady-looking back street. It's
worth the trip though, because
f even if you don’t like anyone in
the bar, someone there is
_ bound to like you.

‘ Since Gooski’s is not a well-
, known bar and this style of
_ music is not universally accept-
1 ed, breaking even can be con-

sidered success. Speaking of

 

, ‘ succeeding, you can even bring

a first date here without worry.

.The beer is cheap, and if she
, thinks you're cheap as well...

    

who cares? You have atmos-
phere.

If your significant other has
other plans for the evening, the
jukebox at Gooski’s is always
\willing to put out. Anything from

Black Sabbath to underground

rockabilly satisfy far-reaching

musical tastes and become

dominatrix a la jukebox for the

evening. Just don’t let anyone
' know if you’re from Cleveland,
or the rabid Steeler fans hang-
ing out in the corner will domi-
nate you.

Gooski’s has the charm and
the presence of a 14-year-old
girl. Sweet but practical in a
rebellious, sarcastic and vulgar
sort of way, Gooski’s is always
on the verge of voluptuating,
but never quite busting out. lt’s

a dive bar training bra ready to

explode all over you. Leave
your religion at the door,
because a whole new one is
coming your way, and the
Reverend James is delivering
the sermon.

“Les Liasons Dangereuses”
written by Cristopher Hampton
directed by W. Stephen
Coleman

The aristocracy is in full
swing on the stage of the
Foster. Otherwise known for
the movie version, Dangerous
Liasons, this late-18th-century
play taunts the seductive
games practiced by the French
prior to the revolution. Sex
becomes a power battle insti-
gated by two scheming aristo-
crats, La Marquise de Merteuil
(Rebekah Slotnick) and Le
Vicomte de Valmont (Zander
Teller). The setting revolves
around a universal French bed
which is constantly being used
by the characters. The white
drapes and pale costumes
complement the gay and witty
life the selfish rich lead during
their sexual frolic. The erotic
behavior and the thirst for
power between the sexes act
as the drive behind this story of
banished romance.

The provocative intrigue that
outlines the performance keeps

your attention, but the articula- ’
tion of the dialogue by the 

actors was weak. Because this

is a piece that demands condi- V

tioning and training in

Shakespearean drama, the j

script cannot be tackled like
any other contemporary play.
Performances by the cast were

convincing and genuine at

times, but the validity was lost
when the eloquence needed to
bestressed. The older, more

. experienced actors held their

postures well. Zander Teller
who plays the handsome lover

_ boy, Le Vicomte, holds the
’ audience with the sensitivity of,
his romances. His affairs and.

relations among the women of

the play convey his flamboyant’
ego that plays with female vul-E :
nerability. The performance of‘ _
Cecile 1
Volanges could be used as 
comparison for this show,'5
because she follows the energy ‘

Mari Sirakos as

of the story with enthusiasm.
Lack of technique and elegance
pulled the show back.

During the climactic seduc- ~

tion of Mme. de Rosemonde

(Sarah Barker) and the sword =

fight with Le Chevalier Danceny
(Robert Kupperman), the glitter-
ing exploitation of emotions
comes crashing in on the
actors. Skillful patience and
framed reactions are deserved
descriptions for the sensual
melodrama that brings the vil-
Iainess’ ploy to an end. Director

W. Stephen Coleman has done '

a brilliant job building the per-
formances and characters

around the plot. The critical ,

scenes have their victorious
moments with the audience, but
again the flow between the

character and actor weighted .

the show.
Convincibilty and authenticity
seem to fuel the objectives

behind the performances in ..

Pitt’s case.
“Les Liasons Dangereuses”
is entertaining with whimiscal
drama despite the theatrical
challenges it poses for the cast.

tions this weekend at Pitt’s

“The Importance of Being
Earnest”
Point Park College Theatre
Company
directed by Jim Prescott
Exposing pretentiousness
and satirizing hypocrisy, bigotry
and the morés of Victorian
England are only a -few of the
characteristics of Oscar Wilde
that I love. I am also over-
whelmed by his painstakingly
touching humor. Wilde has the
ability to deal with subjects like
bigotry and the absurdity of
convention in a way that only
engenders unsullied laughter.
Wilde is known for his celebrat-
ed novel The Picture of Dorian
Gray and his collection of epi-
grams on life, love and society,
but he is probably most famous
for his masterpiece “The

Importance of Being Earnest.”
In what has been called “the
wittiest play in the English lan-
guage,” a young man of excep-
tional means , (Algernon
Moncrieff) creates a fictional
brother to facilitate his expedi-
tions into not-so-proper pas-
times. The rest of the plot is too
convoluted to explain in 5,000
characters — it involves decep-
tion, true love, farcical misun-
derstandings and an extremely
corpulent old lady. Wilde paints
a veritable picture of what can
happen when one tries to
deceive and when onefalls in
love — funny, funny moments.
More importantly, Wilde lam-
poons the importance of
names, family history, marriage
practices, social conventions

and religion. As Jim Prescott, »

director of Point Park’s produc-
tion himself said, the language
of The Importance of Being
Earnest “is so elevated and
witty that a director needs to
make certain the farce is clean

      
     
       
         
    

 
 
 
 
    

and the language is clear.”
Especially for a student cast,
making this production a suc-
cessful one is quite a stretch.
But, the theatre students of
Point Park manage to construct
a show that, for the most part,
works.

The intimate theatre-in-the-
round staging in the Theatre
Downstairs at the Playhouse
provides for a lot of fun for the
actors. Behind the shoulder
winks and small furtive ges-
tures to the audience added a
great deal to the overall produc-
tion and made the show that
much more enjoyable. The cast
seemed rather at ease with the
language, pacing and rhythm of
such a difficult play. Doug
Mertz, the renowned Pittsburgh
actor, was rather effective as
dialect coach, as all of the
actors were quite relaxed with
the exacting, precise, English
spoken in 19th-century London.
The costumes and set were
also exacting and precise and

eliminated the non-traditional
university type of setting that is
usually expected.

A talented group of actors
comprises the cast for Point
Park's “The Importance of
Being Earnest," and they put
together a pretty amusing
show. One hundred years have
passed since this play was first
produced, and it was written in '
such a way that it would be just
as funny today as it was in

-1895. A proficient group of the-

atre artists is needed to do
Wilde justice, and Point Park
College Theatre certainly has
the talent to attain success.

“The Importance of Being
Earnest” runs tonight thru
Sunday in the Theatre
Downstairs at the Playhouse of
Point Park College. Curtain at 8
p.m. Thursday thru Saturday
and 2 p.m. Sunday. Tickets are '
$10-12 and may be purchased
at the box office or by phone at
621-4445.
