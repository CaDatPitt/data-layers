I Buildings Near If Plans (on tinue

By JOHN DeNINNO

A Student Union, gymnasium, Science Hall,

: Dormitory and new School of Engineering will

be built by the.University in the near future if

_present plans are carried through.

Last January, Dean of Men Theodore W. ‘Biddle
announced that restrictions on building materials
for recreational structures had been lifted by the
government. The ban on such
buildings had been placed as a

 

had been lifted hopes for a plan-
nedvstudent Union were similar-

‘Lawn Vetoed As Union Si e _

However, two days after Dean Biddle’s an-

nounced, Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald_ in con-

ﬁrmingpthe fact that the "University still hoped"

to build a Union said that it would not be on the
lawn. _

He_ said that it would not-be practical to put
anymore buildings on the Cathedral Lawn.

unavaﬂability of land plus the need for funds then

'becan1"ev the ‘main detriments to the construction

of a Union. _ 
‘As aﬂresultithere was a good deal of specula-
tion as to where not. only a Student Union" but

other proposed buildings could. be built.

\‘ __ " Land Acrossthe Street Eyed
'The"property across the street from the Ca-
thedral _(Fifth Ave. side) became the most prob-

vable site. This property included the Syria Mosque,
' Masonic Temple, and the Pittsburgh Athletic As-

_sociation. .All these organiaztions were rumored
looking for better facilities. They supposedly hoped

to ﬁndvthe needediland in the area marked for

Cultural Redevelopment in the lower Hilldistrict.
Officials for the three groups did -not deny the

  

His -
- opin.ion‘w_as shared by the Boa_rd of Trustees. The

rumors but said if they should move it would not
be for from three to l'lV€ years. Therefore land for
new University buildings .had to be found else-
where. University officials are still looking.
Engineering Building Planned

But one proposed building became a near reali-
ty when at the annual Century Alumni Club ban-
quet in February Dr. Fitzgerald announced that a
new $1,000,000 School of Engineering would be
erected. The land between the Old Mellon Build-
ing and Thaw Hall is the site for the school. This
property already belongs to the University.

Ground for the structure was to have been
broken this summer but because of, architectural
changes it has been delayed. However bidding on
Engineering School was opened two weeks ago
and the ground breaking will follow the results
of the -bidding.

Dr. Fitzgerald told guests at the alumni ban-
quet that the money for the new Engineering

. School came from a fund which will also be used

to construct a new science hall to be named Clapp

Hall. At the time the fund amountedto $3,500,000.
Science Building Considered Also

The Chancellor said lack of adequate land,‘

close to the present campus, was holding up con-

» structionlof the science building.

_He also said that the New York Life Insurance
Company had agreed .to.ﬁnance a Student Union
when land could be acquired. This same company
ﬁnanced the Field House. v .

Then in April the Chancellor announced plans
for the construction of dormitories. These would
draw a more “diversified” student body to‘Pitt
he said. . V .

Building Campaign Intensive

Dr .Fitzgerald added that although the dormi-
tories are still only plans in the minds of many
people,_because of the intensity ofthe Pitt’s build--
ing campaign, they are not in the too distant
future. , I _

At the same time he revealed plans for a new
gymnasium and a library. However the Chancellor
did not elaborate on these plans.

By mv RCTHMAN T A
Elmer Shuster, IF president, protested Monday the “man-

a “Hands-off fraternity policy.”

In the .heated discussion, SC
‘shoved most of the blame for the
so-called misunderstanding on the
Pitt News, criticiziiig it for false
Heporting.

News Diﬂfere'nt‘

Hazel Hallam, SC vice-president,
stated that the “Pitt News version
was different than the one pre-
sented at the SC meetingﬁf on Oct.
‘18. Sam Granowitz claimed, “The
Pitt News propaganda writer blew‘
up” the suggestion in order to
have a big story.

Ada Joseph, committee member,
stated that the ideas presented by
Steve Beering in his report are
“ideas we’d like to work on in co-
operation with other groups con-
cerned.”. Beering was not present
during the discussion.

 Reese Backs Chairman

 

Ross Reese backed up the chair-

 

ner in which the SC Academic Promotions committee is
handling its recommendation for delayed pledging.” He said
that he “doesn’t see how the full report concerns Academic

promotions.” Shuster also maintained that SC should follow

man’s report with the statement
.“any student has the right to bring
business before any Congress

action had been taken on the re-
port by SC, and that the commit-
tee would discuss each of its goals

 Professional Tactics “
 7 Student Congress members are elected representatives
of‘ the student body and are supposed to function as the
undergraduate governing organization of the University of _
Pittsburgh. ‘As such, they are quite similar to our elected
 state and national'oﬁ‘icials but on a much smaller scale.
,'With' the similarity of position, they should realize that
they are also subject to similar problems and situations,
. and similar treatment by_the presswhen their activities are
' ' covered by a newspaper. Now our full-time politicians have
a way of alibing their mistakes or slips of the tongue that
"iappear. in print by saying thatthey were_“misqouted” or
'1'» their-,remarks“were“misinterpreted.” The publicity over
  a‘ remark recently made by one of SC’s committee chair-
 »man concerning delayed fraternity rushing, stirring up a
tempest-"that was promptlyh-urled back into the laps of the
K g solons. When‘the matter came to a head in the latest Con-
 ~ A gress meeting, several of the congressmen came through in
._" = ‘ ﬁne style and criticized the News for “false reporting” and
' ' referred to the reporter covering the meeting as a f‘propa-
ga-nda writer.” The committeeman himself was not at the
, meeting to take part in the di'sc'ussion,’ but there was noth-
"  ing false about the story we printednor was any
made .to “slant” the story in one "direction or another.
. It is high time that the members of Student Congress_
realize that the students have a‘ right to know what goes i
on in" Congress meetings. If some of them wish to save
,, themselves from theembarrassment of seeing their ﬂow-
ing phrases in black and white, they should stop and taste
{their words before they allow them to be spoken. The
‘News has not resorted to the antiquated tactics of the
.“yellow journalism” trade nor have we sunk to the depths .
. where we have to depend/on “coloring” -——minor s
 _' for the sake of a story. We have printed, and will‘

United We Stand

By Elinore Stone
Whatever the doubts and fear, skepticism or
criticism, disbelief or despair, United Nations Day

was celebrated by peoples all over the world last ..
“Saturday.

Throughout the nations, believers in
the UN noted with faith and hope that eight
years have passed since the UN Charter, reafﬁr'm-

ing “faith in human rights and the dignity and

worth of the human person and
the equal rights of men and

small,” was signed in San Fran-
cisco. é
All Nations Celebrate

In New York last Saturday,
there were parades and meetings
and speeches. In Monrovia,
Liberia, reported the New York
Times, “the longest street in the
city .was renamed United Nations Drive. In San
Jose, Costa Rica, the ceremonies included the open-
ing of a new. school named United Nations_ School.

“In the place de la Liberte, Toulon’, France, a,
Navy band concert.was on the -program. And in
churches in all of Manila, capitalgof the Philip-
pines, the ringing of bells was, ordered.” .

Right here in Pittsburgh, two events took place,

 

one on the eve of Uhited.Nations Day last week, 4

reminding those who participated ofeach indiv-
idual’svand_ each nation’s* necessary part‘ in a united
ﬁght for peace. The ﬁrst was "the International

Dinner held last Thursday as part of Pitt’s ‘own’

UN Week celebration. -

,_lt’was, a wonderful example of many nationali-
ties working, /learning and enjoying together. If
those who planned, prepared and participated in
the event, however, did so only with the idea of

. accomplishing a set program,-' then the value was

lost. ._
Worthwhile Achievement ’

But’ if even some there sensed the worthwhile
achievement and the harmony of such a uniting
of peoples in ‘doing a‘job,'h‘owever small it may
ever be, then great power was and is ours,

There, is that basement, ‘around a\dinner table

laddened with the remains of food representing

20 nations, well-ﬁlled and at ease, listening to

German and Hungarian and.Dutch songs and talk-

iqg with students of all races, religions and nation- '

alities, was the nucleus of a powerf l united world.
What great things we might have achieved that
night if a world—shaping‘wand had been ours.
On Friday,
birthday, Jim Lucas, Scripps-Howard war cor-
respondent just back, from Korea, spoke to ‘hun-

dreds of Pittsburghers about that small now—devas- -
tated country which became a battlegroundof .
ideologies and a test to the strength .and deter- P

minations of the UN.

What We Fought For A» r
Whether to put the record of Korea among

.the achievements or failures of.the UN is a still-
debateable question among some world thinkers. »

But Jim Lucasulived for three years in that divided
nation with .the men who didn’t stop to question

if it'was right or wrong that they were there or‘.

what they were ﬁghting for; but, instead fought
and too often died to uphold the UN Charter, to
“resist aggression and breaches of the peace.”-

Sixteen .members of the United Nations, accord- \-

ing to the New York Times, “today bear the me-
mories of their dead and care of their wounded-
and crippled, the price paid for the successful
resistance to the inifasion of South Korea.” But,
as Jim Lucas said, our dead as well as all others
were ﬁghting for the rights of little nations aaginst
the vicious beast of Communism. And, ‘however.
heartbreaking the struggle has been, their sacri-
ﬁces were not in vain. V
Lest‘ We Forget

And so we, the living, must not feel‘our‘strug-
gles are in vain. We in America, we in Europe,

we  the East——we everywhere. Everlasting peace, .
everlasting freedom and everlasting goodwill are.

not vain heroes..
“With, malice toward none with charity for all;

with ﬁrmness in the right, as -God gives us to see» ,

the right, ,let us strive on to ﬁnish the work we

are in; to bind up the,nation’s wounds; to care for -'

hini who shall have borne the battle, and for his

A conversation with Bill
Thompson is a sure way of
becoming a hockey fan.

“Hockey is a sport that gets . "S

says the All-American hockey

star from Colorado College, now _

a freshman in Pitt law school.
“Prince” Likes It Rough
Bill, a handsome 21-year-old
athlete, was named “Prince”
Thompson by his team mates and
friends. An expert in hockey, Bill
says, “the tougher the game, the
better.” ;
He attended Colorado College on

S ahockey scholarship. In his first

year, he played'on the freshman

In his senior year, he was hon-

With the loss to Northwestern eliminating them from
a possible post-season game, the Panthers can play without

Of course, the Blue and’Gold is still considered one of

the country’s bestlteams with onlyé

one win, but this Saturday they’ll

Booters Still
Seeking irst

By TEDD. TABACHNICK

Pitt’s defeated but undaunt-'
ed soccer club will still be
looking for their first victory
when it visits Slippery ‘Rock next
Tuesday. _Last_ Saturday the Pan-
therbooters lost their third game

at Denison, O. - «

After getting behind in the ﬁrst
half, even their thrilling second

"half comeback wasn’t enough to

overcome the deﬁcit. The improv-
ed playing is evidenced by the fact
that heretofore dependence on Gil
Simons for an offense was reliev-
ed as]/like Culhane scored a pair
of goals and George Matthews
chipped in the others.

The defense seemed to be the
downfall of the Panthers though,
and emphasis is n-ow being placed
on building up a stronger and
more impregnable defense wall
that the opposition will. have to
go through.

Leo Bemis, adviser to the team,
offered no excuses for the de-
feat, and even commented on the
great amount of- spirit still evi-
denced by the boys. Suﬂice it to
say, however, that, after narrow
defeats‘ to both. Ohio State and
Oberlin, the Denison team was
just about “due”. There were
good points to the game, neverthe-
less, two of which were the ﬁne
efforts turned in by Matthews and
Ted Phillips.

Prospectsfor the coming games
seem bright, as a former member
of Penn St at e ’ s championship
team,.Phil Rogers, now plays for
Pitt and should bolster the de-
fense. The scrimages held this
week should do a lot to iron out

Phi Delta

By JOE MONTUORO

A strong Phi Delta “Theta
team kept up its merry win-
ning ‘ways by overwhelming

Schenley Oval. In chalking up
their fourth win, as against one
defeat, the Phi Delts are now fn
hot pursuit of the league leaders,
Delta Tau Delta; DTD has ﬁve
wins and no losses. A
Suffering their fourth defeat,
the Pi Lambs found the Delts too
forceful to handle. Before the
Lambs could score their lone
,tally, the Delts had racked up a
score of 20-0 —— all in the ﬁrst
quarter. The ﬁrst goal for the
Delts came on the fourth play

ligan clicked with Dick Shannon,
who was standing alone in the
end zone. '
John Laneve made it 12-0
' when he intercepted a Lamb
aerial and outran the entire op-
position. ‘.Pi Lamb,»whos!e line
was of no help to the backﬁeld,
was caught behind “the goal on
one of the few ‘times they had
the ball, and the Delts took two
points on the safety. .

By this time it was evident that
the Delts passing attack had com-
pletely bewildered Pi Lambda
Phi. In the fading minutes ofthe

. ﬁrst quarter Vic Zach heaved ‘a

50-yard pass from his own ten to
Shannon, who was "completely~.un-
guarded. This opened the way to
20-0. . L
The Lambs’ only score came

It never does any good to rake an ofﬁcial after he makes
a questionable decision, since decisions of judgment are
hardly retractable. But when he calls a play that takes you
right out of the ball game, you can’t help but feel that lateral
stripes on his costume would more appropriately beﬁt his
nature. But such was the general feeling among Pitt follow-
erslast Saturday at Evanston when one of the Big Ten oﬁi-
cials fashioned his judgment after Northwestern sentiments.

‘The rules state that when a pass receiver has gained
possession of the ball, in the referees opinion, it is a fumble
if he drops it. At Northwestern receiver grabbed a. pass,
half turned, took two and a half steps (at least), and was
promptly separated from the ball when two Panthers cut

him down hard.
Ed,Stowe pounced on the ball, but the. old eyes of the

ref saw the play as an incomplete pass. Pitt was having
enough trouble holding on to the ball as it was, without be-
ing denied possession resulting from alert play.

The interference play that presented Northwestern
with a touchdown occurred too far away from the view
of this corner to merit comment, except that we naturally
thought he was "awfully stuﬁy about the whole thing.

Red Dawson was embittered to the point of silence after
the game,’ and with just cause, considering, that the ﬁne
second-half corriback of his boys was wiped out by the mere
whim of one person. v

* * ‘ *

How unfortunate that the nature of cross-country
running deprives sport fans of the chance to watch Pitt’s
winningest athletic team in action. Coach Carl Olson’s
harriers have almost completely monopolized the point-
making in racking up seven straight wins—-they not only
win, they shut out their victims. Their fans, few but
rabid, are true followers. They follow the meets in au-
tomobiles.

Scoring all their points in the ﬁnal quarter, Pitt's fresh-
man football squad came through to overcome a half-time
deﬁcit of nine points and defeated the State frosh by a
ten—point margin at State College last Saturday.

Stymied by a pre-game steak 6

which left ill effects on many of
the players’ stomachs, plus the
usual case of nerves and 145
yards lost in penalties, Coach
Steve Petro’s men didn’t break_
into the scoring column until
Dick Sherer grabbed Dick Len-
hart’s pass and scampered 43
yards for a touchdown, the total
play covering over 70 yards.
Tom Jenkins set up the next
score by nabbing a State pass on
his own forty-ﬁve yard line and
returning it to the Nittany forty-
five. From there, Joe Walton,
Jenkins, and Bugs Bagamery
carried the ball into striking dis-
tance where Cornelius Salva-
terra bucked the line for a six-
pointer on his second try.

In the waning moments of the
game, Salvaterra, in what Petro
cited as “the most outstanding
piece of individual work of the
game,” cayght a punt and dis-
played‘ beautiful open-ﬁeld run-
ning as he raced sixty yards to pay
dirt. Darrell Lewis split‘ the up-
rights to tack on the extra point.

Petro highly praised Chuck
Cost, Ralph Ciper, Nick Passo-
delis, Lenhart, and Lewis, who
carried the backﬁeld burden for
three quarters while the other
boys were recuperating from the
nasty effects of the sirloins. Jim
Lenhart was singled out espe-
cially by Petro for his skillful
offsetting of the Nittany defense
