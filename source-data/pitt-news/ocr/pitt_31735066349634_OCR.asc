 ODI Rejects Townhouse Plan

4*-

t_p .

BY MAGGIE McKAY

Oakland Directions Inc. (ODI)
last week rejected a University plan
_to build 22 student townhouses on a
Bates Street and Oakland Avenue
parking lot on the grounds that
construction would violate a 1971
University agreement to confine its
development within existing boun-
daries.

The ODI is a planning group
comprised of representatives from
Oakland schools, libraries, stores
and residents. As an ODI member,
Pitt was required to advise the
organization in advance of any
proposed building programs.

“We were told that there will be
a shortage of University housing
for ﬁve years and so a survey was
made of existing University facili-
ties and lots which could be
renovated to offset the shortage,"
Jay Roling, assistant to the Vice
Chancellor for Public Affairs said.

The Bates Street lot, which the
University owns, has two distinct
advantages according to Roling:
size and availability. ' _

“In January,‘ I appraised ODI of
our housing needs and told them
we were studying the use of
townhouses, whose small and
individual architecture ‘w/ould blend
more with the existing homes,”_-

  New System To Improve
Athletic Complex Security ,   -

Cy ,

BY CONNIE GIEL

A door-and-turnstile security
system much like Hillman Library's
has been approved for Trees Hall,
according to Campus Police Chief
Curt Graham.

The University's physical plant
has been awarded an unofficial bid,
and, according to area coordinator
Russ__.Iones, construction costs and
dates have not been set.

The new security system is

designed to tighten entrance to the .

athletic complex buildings, Gra-
ham said. “The perimeter control,

6 with the desk people we have now,

 

is good, but if we get a rush of
people crowding to get in, there’s
no way everyone's I.D. could be
checked."

The main doors at the Trees
entrance will remain unchanged,
Graham said, but the secondary
doors inside will house the
turnstiles and a buzzer system.

“The partitions will be solid. not
like the library's metal rails, which
could break apart if anything
heavier than 25 pounds leaned on
them." Graham said. “Besides,

 

‘ The new security system in the athletic complex should make it
der»fornon-.University,peopl tp __l,)ypa_ss‘_j,desl,<1 personnel, _ .
:1;

people can sooot under those,

which would defeat our purpose.” ,

The security /designers were
concerned with the building's
appearance, he said. “This is one
plan -that can be done tastefully,
and won’t change the look of Trees
drastically.” - I '

Additional’ security measures

— have been planned, such as locking

all doors other than the main
entrance during the day, in both
Trees and the Field House.

“We're having trouble now with
our own faculty,” associate physi-
cal education professor Ken Metz
said. “They insist on opening
outside doors to let their classes
through. and it messes up our
security."

The athletic department a month
ago hired students to man a desk
in the Field House and check IDs.
“We did it to keep out a bunch of
people who don't belong," athletic
director Casimir Myslinski said.

“We'll keep the desk person_

until the security gets better, but

this should be a problem for t-he

campus police anyway," he said.

Roling said. “And if the need for 
housing dropped off, the individual '

units could be rented to members
of the community-at-1arge.”

Bates Street residents circulated
a petition which argued against the
proposal, maintaining the area was
already densely populated.
Brought up for a vote at ODI’s_
March meeting‘, the proposal was
defeated by a vote of seven to two,
with three groups abstaining.

In addition to the townhouses,

which would require zoning ap-‘

proval, the University’s alternate

plan for the Bates Street lot called

for one apartment house which

A new football ticket- distribution
system, which includes a proposal
for ticket allotment for away
games, was approved by Chancel-
lor Wesley Posvar last week.

‘ Under the plan, 10,010 general
admission ticketsoin the student

section will be reserved for

full-time undergraduate and grad-
uate students for each home game.
Students may purchase a season
ticket for three dollars or secure
free tickets on an individual game

Union Runoff

PPU,Pred

. BY CRIS HALL ‘

The faculty union election
runoff scheduled for tomorrow and
Wednesday “will be a close race
between the Pitt Professional
Union (PPU) and the No Represen-
tative option, according to PPU
president Van‘ Beck Hall.

“If we do win, it won’t’ be by _a
big margin,” Hall said yesterday.

Hall said he foresees a large

faculty turnout for the runoff,
especially with the second day,
Wednesday, a University-wide
payday. “I think a lot of faculty
will vote when they come in to pick
up their checks.”

Hall also said his union did not
seek endorsement from the Student
Government Board (SGB), and that
Thursday's SGB vote of non-sup-
port will probably have little
bearing, if any, on the election.

‘‘I doubt whether students could
have much of an impact on the
lelection's outcome,” Hall said.
“Actually, the SGB should neither
support or not‘support the issue.

basis, provided they remain after
season tickets are purchased.

Ticket distribution for games at
Notre Dame and Penn State also is
included in they plan. Twenty per
cent of the tickets alloted to Pitt by

the home ‘school will be available ,

‘exclusively for student perchase at
the price set by the home school.

Notre Dame has alloted Pitt
5,000 tickets for the game at South
Bend. According to Athletic Direc-
tor Casimir Myslinksi, 1,000 of
these will be available for student
purchase at $9 each. ’

Hall dismissedas “naive” SGB
member Gary Tweed’s observation
that student interests (lower
tuition) and union interests (high
salaries) may eventually conﬂict.

“That situation is going to occur
this fall, and no collective
bargaining will be organized by
that time,” Hall said.

“It’s pretty much obvious tuition
will increase this fall and salaries
must rise if the University wishes
to keep faculty members.

“With or without collective
bargaining, you'd have the same
situation.”

One. reason the SGB gave for
their refusal to endorse the PPU
was the union’s refusal to endorse
student participation at the bar-
gaining table.

“We might be talked into
student participation at the bar-
gaining table, but as of right now
we do not support that proposal.

“What students should remem-
ber is that the bargaining table is
- just the tip of the iceberg,” Hall
said. “Eight months of putting
contract ‘proposals together pre-

If the University goes ahead with

A campus policeman stationed in
the Trees area now patrols the
athletic facilities regularly, Graham
said. “It'd be too expensive to get
another rover,” he said, “and he’d
still have to cover a lot of ground.”

All doors in the complex are
currently locked at night, except for

-the Field House desk entrances.

Trees Hall can only be entered
through the Field House tunnel.
Locking doors violates fire
regulations, but Graham said he
hopes it will be overlooked until the
security system is fully operational.
“The plan originally included
alarms on those doors. which would
let them be unlocked,” soccer
coach Leo Bemis said. “But we
don't have the budget for that kind

of stuff." An alarm system could
cost as much as $23,000, he said.
Television monitors were also
considered, Graham said. “But
they'd be stationary as well as
 expensive, and you’d have to have
a person watching them all the
time. A roving guard is still
better."

One aspect of the additional.

security measures already is
operational. Five emergency phon-
es have been installed in the Trees
complex—one each on the gym,
pool area, women’s issue room,
front desk and handball courts.

A hookup to the Field House
desk from an outside phone is
planned, and may be ready this
week. Graham said.

_ Tomorrow and Wednesday the faculty again goes to the polls to
decide whether they desire to have a union representing their interests
on the Pitt campus. The circumstances around this new election are
different than they were three weeks ago, when the last elections were
held. Then, three separate unions were involved; now there is only the
Pitt Professional Union (PPU). Then, the PPU offered a vague proposal

' ' The PPU, representing many of the teachers we meet everyday in

  

 class, in fairness should at least welcome the proposal that student .

. students already facing a possible tuition hike have a vested interest in

salary talks between faculty and administration.‘ In the end, the
' students would end up paying for any salary increase.

The PPU is interested in more than salary hikes for teachers. They
also are ooncemed with classroom size, course content and other ,

What happens at Pitt determines what happens to us the rest of our _
lives. Students have a right to take part in anything that happens here,
because in the end, it’s our future we’re talking about.

The PPU has said “faculty interests are the same as student
interest,” and that a faculty union would be in the best interests of
students. But _this is not the case. The students have different

H I interests, some of them opposed to those of the faculty. If the faculty

asks "for a salary increase, it might be in the best interests of the

Prof. Roublev referred to a
lengthy recommendation for tenure
signed by 19 tenured members of
my department." In fact the
history department was badly split
on this issue. and the vote of the
tenured members was 10 to 9. with
4 abstentions. In our experience
such a weak plurality would hardly
be construed as a strong recom-
tenure by a

department. Since the vote was in
-- favor of promotion. the recommen-
dation was forwarded with the
signatures of 19 of those present at
the meeting. However, in view of
the narrowness of the decision, it is

' likely that the “lengthy recom-

mendation for tenure" contained
summaries of the reasons both for
and against promotion.

In regard to the review by the ad
hoc committee, Dr. Roublev

Er. it, if they wish to keep good teachers at Pitt.
" There are too many issues at stake to make a blanket statement like
' “faculty interests are the same as student interest.” ‘v.
Until we see a faculty union that is willing to be responsive to student
needs, we will have to maintain the position we’ve maintained all
along: that, at present, a facultyunion does not belong at Pitt.

   

administration was added to the
committee at its second meeting.
In fact, this person is a regular, ex
officio member of all such_
committees, but due to an error in
scheduling, had a prior engage-
ment to attend a professional
meeting away from Pittsburgh on
the date of the first meeting.

It is difﬁcult for us to judge
between the allegations by Dr.
Roublev and the reply of Dean
Rosenberg concerning the “pur-
loined" signature sheet‘. However,
the great signiﬁcance of that point,
eludes us, since the signatures
certify only that a majority of the
votes were in favor of promotion,
not that all of the signers voted for
promotion.

Each tenure decision is a very
serious matter, and we expect that
this case will be examined by the
appropriate academic review com-
mittees to see whether there is
substance to any of Dr. Roublev's
complaints. In the meantime, the
facts available to us suggest that
the attack on the integrity of Dean
Rosenberg was unwarranted and
that the university as a whole will
suffer if such distorted descriptions
of the decision process are left ,
unchallenged.

"70 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

BY BOB PELLEGRINI

Last Wednesday, an article entitled “Senate Bill
One Defended” by Dan Mulholland appeared in the
Pitt News. I ﬁnd it interesting that we received only
one letter commenting on it. One letter out of
thirteen thousand students; that’s pretty disgusting,
when you think about it.

About a month ago Mulholland wrote another
column praising Senator Joe McCarthy and his
contributions to this nation. Now that article brought
in a flood of mail, most of itcalling Mulholland a
fascist, and calling the. Pitt News a reactionary rag.

Two weeks ago the Pitt News published a column
by Jack Romberg entitled “The Story They Never
Told You” and again the Pitt News got swamped, the
Pitt News still gets a letter or two about that story.
most of them giving Romberg a few days to get out of
town, and calling the Pitt News a radical, commie rag
for publishing such stuff.

Both of these articles excited a lot of people, but.
they dealt with subjects that really don’t mean that
much: McCarthy has been dead for almost twenty
years now and what Romberg believes about the
Bible really doesn’t make much difference to the
course of history.

But then the Pitt News openly‘ ran a one-sided
article that dealt with something that can affect the
quality of American life for the next century, and we

, get one, count ’em, one letter. Does anybody really

care about Senate Bill One? To ﬁnd out, I did an
opinion poll, asking the Man-in-the-Street (who was
sitting in Gustine’s) if he knewwhat S-1 was.

“S-1? ” the “Man-in-the-Street” in Gustines said.
“Ain’t that some new kind of vitamin?” S-1! The
new energied vitamin that willimprove your sex life
and your dandruff at the same time. Other people

thought S-1 was a new car from Pontiac, a low level P

sociology course, or the Air Force’s.new manned
bomber. But what exactly is S-1?
Senate Bill One is_ one of the, most important

’ documents of this century. It promises to create a

new age of law and order—or an oppressive society
in which 1984 would come eight years early.

Senate Bill One is intended to revamp the now
obsolete U.S. Criminal Code that hasn’t been
changed since 1909. Some of the things that S-1
would do are: bring back the death penalty, make
possession of marijuana a federal offense, give

‘ law-enforcement agencies more extensive wire-tap-

ping powers, improve civil ri hts enforcement,
provide limited compensation for victims of crimes,
and make it ‘a crime to publish classiﬁed documents,
such as the Ellsberg Papers.

Under S-1, the Watergate defendants ‘would not
have gone to jail, but Jack Anderson might have.

Under S-1, it would be a felony to even talk about"

revolution, or have a mass demonstration against the
government. _ 1

Perhaps one reason people seem unaware of S-1
and its consequences ‘is the title itself. Senate Bill
One: it sounds rather dry, as Senate bills usually.are.

To Rosenberg  

Dear Dean Rosenberg: .

The action of the ad hoc
committee and your support of that
action in the case of Professor Dan
Tannacito is a most serious breach
of professional ethics, of collegial-
ity, and of the academic freedom of
the English department.‘ ,

Professor Tannacito was "hired by
the English Department to fulfill
certain_ obligations which the
English department felt were part
of its mission. As part of their
professional duties, the tenured

But they’re not. And judging from the response
the Pitt News gets concerning different articles,’
people are concerned with things they have deﬁnite
ideas about, like McCarthy and the bible. But people
don’t really know what to think about S-1: on one
hand, it would be really nice to be able to walk down

“Swept Away"

She is a vicious, castrating bitch,
who does nothing but complain,
humiliate him and get on every-
body's nerves. He is an honest,
decent, hardworking, patient man,
who does his best to comply with
her unreasonable demands. But a
self-respecting man can take only
so much, and, ﬁnally, he rebels and
asserts his masculinity. That is to
say, he punches her in the mouth,
abuses and humiliates her, beats
her up, brutally rapes her. “Admit
that's what you want!” he hisses,
punching her in the mouth again.
“Admit that you really love it!”

Well, she doesn’t respond right
away, but pretty soon she’s kissing
his foot (literally), purring with
passion and begging for more.

This is a new twist to the

“The (capitalist) bitch got what she

delivering “a scurrilous attack on
Dean Rosenberg," and derides the
PPU for supporting my case. Let
me shed some light on Galpern‘s
“interpretation” of my open letter.

My letter contained no “version
of the department's course of
action"; this course of action will
be brought out next week in

meetings of the FAS Tenure and
Promotion Review Board—my o-
pen letter only stated the outcome

of the action: “the issuing of a
letter recommending tenure upon
which 19 individuals, being of
sound mind and body, placed their
signatures.” I accuse the_Dean of
malfeasance, and have brought this

accusation to the attention of the
Senate Committee on Academic
Freedom and Tenure, where the

specific allegations are presently .

being investigated. My specula-
tions as to the Dean’s motives are

not innuenaoes (covert allusions to
something not directly named),

they are clmirlx stated and
deslgnated as speculations.

The PPU's support of my case
stems from the Union's view that

the procedures used by the Dean
were flawed, and that the series of
events I reported are accurate and
do not constitute due process. The
Union does not identify itself with

my speculations, which have their
origin _in my political views and for
which I am solely responsible...
These views might be distasteful
to Neal Galpern, and this is his

right. To cast aspersions on the
PPU for what it is not doing is an
oldianti-union tactic, and 1 hope
would be recognized as such.

Can Instructors

Communicate?

If the administration is so

concerned with the views, beliefsfﬁéi

and quality of the faculty, I feel
they should take a much closer
look.

Nothing is more frustrating and
infuriating than having a foreign
instructor whose vocabulary and
ability to communicate are no
better than a first grader’s. Their
political views may be as “radical”
as Dr. Paul Nyden’s but we will
never know because they are
unable to tell us.

Dr. Paul Nyden is an intelligent

Dog Days

Barks and Bites in Business

BY CONNIE GIEL

They really take it seriously.
Some do it for fun, others for
money———and. all agree there's
something in it for those on both
ends of the leash. _

Showing dogs is big business,
but there's still room for the
backyard mutt and his enthusiastic
owner.

Professional dog handlers pran-
ced their charges in what amounted
to a 15-ring circus in the Civic
Arena last weekend, while on the

lvother end of the Arena, novices

coaxed and cajoled their equally
novice pets into making like the big
time.

The pro -dogs, old hands at
showing, snoozed between groom-
ings and classes, but the puppies
yipped and paced. The Arena ﬂoor
was littered with newspapers and
an occasional puddle. Everywhere,
people juggled hot dogs and real
dogs, crowding and joking and
bumping into old friends.

Saturday's show, sponsored by
the Western Pennsylvania Kennel
Association, starred some of the
best dogs in the country.

v ~«



 Elegance and earthiness were

represented in borzois and beagles.
The show program listed categories
for every size, color, age and sex of
every imaginable breed.

 

One woman, nursing a popsicle
and a baby at the same time, kept a
careful eye on a moppet of a dog in
a crib at her side. She bounced the
baby and chirped at the dog, all
three unperturbed by the streams
of people passing by.

Sharing the ice cubes from her
Coke with a petite collie, another
woman answered countless “what
kind of dog is that” and talked
about her life on the dog show

' circuit.

Barbara Booher, of Reno, Nev-
ada said the Pittsburgh show was
just one of the dozens she works 50
weeks each year. Her husband was
showing in Chicago at the same
time, she said, handling other
dogs. Both licensed handlers, the
Boohers each made more than
$18,000 last year, mostly by
showing all types of breeds for
other owners. '

They travel in vans and motor

‘homes with their dogs, as do most

dog people. One of the Booher’s
dogs, a miniature schnauzer, has
traveled more than a half-million
miles on the show circuit, she said.

“We swear we hate it, the
traveling and all, and that we’ll
never go back to a show, but we
always do,” Booher said.

Another miniature schnauzer
hung limply from a grooming arm,
a metal harness with a sling collar,

dog's owner, Karole Stuart, brush-
ed and ﬂuffed it, even wiped
between its toes.

Stuart said she and her husband
travel with six schnauzers to 62
shows each year, most of them
between their home in Cleveland
and Chicago.

Minutes later, her schnauzers
were on display in the show‘ ring.
The dogs marched onto the green
carpet, as somber and dignified as
old grey men.

“Dogs are judged according to a
standard type for each breed, not
against each other,” according to
one of the show managers, Keith
Miller.

Judges -look for the way a dog
measures up to the perfect breed
type, using conformation, condi-
tion, gait and temperament stan-
dards.

Dogs compete under two point
systems, Miller said, one to make
the animal a champion and another
to make it the top dog in the
country.

When a dog wins a champion-
ship—15 points, including two
major wins—it can compete in open
(not breed) and best-of-breed
classes. The champion title applies
for the life of the dog.

The number of championship
points garnered depends on the
number of dogs of that breed
competing at a particular show.

Major wins for a championship

must be won under different
judges, according to show chair-
man David Leahy, to prevent
favoritism and ensure the dog is
truly representative of the breed
type. »
But judging may still be more
subjective than some exhibitors
like. “After a while, you learn
which judges like your dogs and
which won’t give them a second
look,” apprentice handler June
Kehres said as she groomed her
boss’ huskies. “We aren’t going to
a show tomorrow because my boss
doesn’t like the judges,” she said
matter-of-factly.

Would-be judges begin by
working puppy matches with breed
clubs, Miller said. Others work as
ring stewards or handlers, and
immerse themselves in showing.

terriers, for example, might begin
by showing Airedales, then fami-
liarize himself with miniatures and
fox terriers. “You then apply to
the AKC (American Kennel Club)
for a -license, and hope no
one has registered any complaints
against you,” Miller said.

Breeders can apply right _away,
with prompt licensing, unless they
are of the “puppy mill” variety,
Miller said. “There are conscien-
tous breeders, the ones who breed
for quality not quantity,” he said,
“and then there are the others.
They buy a top dog from a good
breeder and use his name and
reputation to turn out hordes of
puppies for quick sale.”

Most professionals limit them-
selves to a handful of excellent
dogs and show prospects, he said,
and still manage to make as much
money as the less scrupulous
breeders.

Those who do get licensed can
expect to bargain for their pay. A
judge may get $1.50 per dog, or a
ﬂat rate of $400-$450 per show,
plus expenses, Miller said. A good
judge can make $50,000 a year, he
said. ,

Handlers, however, who preen
and pose the dogs, can make as
much as $150,000 a year, he said.
“At a $50-a-dog minimum fee, per
day, with 25 dogs, you can clean up
at a two-daypshow” Miller said.

Serious dogs, judges and hand-

Competitors follow the weather;

If it's spring and temperatures
are in the mid-sixties and chocolate
Easter bunnies ﬁll counters at
Woolworth’s and you’ve brought
your frisbee out of the attic—can
your fall tuition bill be far away?..

Yes, friends, not only is winter
term almost over, fall term is
nearly here and no doubt you’ve
already picked up some bills from
the University during your morning
trek through the mailroom. And
prices are zooming upward. While
the ﬁnal word isn't in yet on
tuition, room and board rates have
already gone up—-how do you cope
with it ‘all?’

Aside from those traditional
sources like the Pennsylvania
Higher Education Assistance
Agency and the Basic Educational
Opportunity Grant program, the
next best place to look is at the
Student Aid Ofﬁce. \ .

With few» exceptions, all aid

- administered by the Office of

Admissions and Student Aid is
based on ﬁnancial need. Both

full-time and part-time graduate,
and undergraduate students are —

eligible, but all applicants must be
enrolled as degree candidates.

 

VE\)$a§\\'s

Loans handled by the office are:

National Direct Student Loan:
The NDSL has a low (3%) interest
rate. The_maximum loan for
undergraduate and graduate school
is $10,000; the undergraduate may
borrow up to $5,000. The amount
of the loan can never exceed the
need, which is determined by an
independent organization, .the Col-
lege Scholarship Service.

Supplemental Educational Op-
portunity Grant: THE SEOG may
not exceed the lesser of $1500 or
half the total amount of student
ﬁnancial aid provided by the
school. Grants‘ are restricted to
undergraduates.

College Work-Study Program:
The program’-provides students
with jobs on and off campus.

University Scholarship: Awards
vary from $100 per year to full
tuition. Renewal of the scholarship
is based on continued demonstra-
tion of ﬁnancial need and academic
achievement. The minimum grade
point average is 2.75. In order to
be eligible for consideration,
students must have a 3.00 QPA and
have accumulated 30 credits.
Limited to undergraduates only.

Special Program Grants: Eligi-
bility is based on student participa-
tion in special programs (i.e.,
engineering, nursing, UCEP);

So, as Winter ’76 draws to a

close, get your dad’s 1040 and a-

good supply of"Bic pens—you’ll
need them.

The deadline for ﬁling student
aid applications is April 1.

What is the Pitt Professional Ilnion?
GR Ten Reasons Not to Vote for PM! I

The PLRB ruling of March 15 on the run-off election for March 30 and 31 provides
a dramatically clear choice for the faculty of the Provost's area. Faculty members
who have already been sold on the ideological value of unionism will vote for PPU.
We warn the rest of our colleagues—let the buyer beware. ‘

Many of the implications of being represented by PPU as Local 3414 of the Amer-
ican Federation of Teachers—AFL/ClO are not universally appreciated by the po-
tential members of the bargaining unit. We believe that if they are, the faculty will
choose to keep their options open by an overwhelming vote forNO REPRESENT-
ATIVE. We have said little in previous bulletins about PPU because we did not ex-
pect it to get to the run-off. The fact that is has done so is probably more of a
tribute to the organizational skill and dedication of its membership than to. the
basic appeal of the AFT program if that is clearly understood. The facts which we
present below are verifiable public knowledge and contrast sharply with the com-
forting rhetoric of the recent PPU statement which asks, “Who's Afraid of the
PPU?” As the writers of that statement apply, many people are worried about being
represented bythe PPU. Here are some of their reasons.

1.) PPU is the union local for the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), a" mil-
tant trade union group which normally makes no pretense of being a professional
union of the AAUP‘ type. Although AFT has recently become the bargaining agent
for the New York and Florida University systems its membership is predominetly
drawn from secondary and high schools. Thus, out of thirty vice presidents in the

huge union bureaucracy only one comes from an institution of higher learning (see ‘

Chronicle of Higher Education, July 21,1975).

2.) PPU has mailed out a series of position papers describing programs and resolu-
tions to which many of the faculty could happily subscribe. They have astutely

avoided any implication that PPU can guarantee or promise to deliver these benefits.» .

Presumably the writers know that the ultimate contract must be acceptable to both
parties and that many of their proposals may be ruled as not-bargaining unless the
University bargainers agree. Since the AFT has‘a record of hard-nosed adversarial
negotiations we expect that the University would yield the minimum in such deal-
ings. The recent Court decision remanding twenty-one non—bargainab|e items back
to PLRB after four years of litigation leaves such matters as the possibility for
faculty input to library planning or University governance in limbo. We do not
question the desires of PPU to raise the issues described in their position papers. We
simply think it is unrealistic to suppose they could implement more than a fraction
of them with legal force. I

3.) Under the militant leadership of AFT—PPU there is high likelihood of a faculty
strike. If this sounds far-fetched, note that of the only two AFT institutions of
higher learning in Pennsylvania (Robert Morris College and Moore College of Art),
the former has already gone through a bitter strike. AFT also represents three two
year community colleges in Pennsy|vania—Allegheny County, Bucks County and
Reading Area. Allegheny hasalready been struck. Such actions are consistent with
the Ladd-Lipset Survey report in Chronicle of Higher Education for February 17,
1976, which shows that (77%) of AFT officers identify themselves as miltants (9%
for AAUP) and clearly endorse the use of strikes and picketing. Faculty members
who have found the present campaign trying may imagine the acrimony and ten-
sion of a strike with picket lines. \ '

4.) Although AFT union locals such as PPU may maintain considerable autonomy
they are clearly tied to an enormous power structure which expects something
back for what it gives. The announcement in December of a unanimous vote of sup-
port by PP.U of the Pittsburgh AFT school strike is not so surprising when viewed
in the context. As’ a member of an AFL-CIO union local you may be ‘expected or

‘ pressured to support off-campus political positions in which you do not believe.

AFT traditionally offers much local freedom and autonomy during their organiz-

ing phase (as PPU is doing). After the election, union discipline tends to tighen up.’

5.) With PPU as your exclusive legal bargaining agent you will no longer be able to
negotiate matters having to do with your salary or working conditions with your



department head or clean. Indeed, under the PLRB ruling for Pitt your department 

chairman will no longer be working with or for you and your colleagues—he will
legally be on the management side of the bargaining table. - '

6.) ‘The Pitt administration has taken the position that the facultyshould not be‘ ‘

divided into separate bargaining units. If PPU wins in the run-off the Provot's area
will indeed be separated fromthe rest of the University. As a result, the University

could be expected to file exceptions which could result in lengthy administrative I
and court proceedings. One can only speculate as to when negotiations would be .-

concluded and pay increases effected. One may note that even without such delays,
Temple's July 1, 1973, salary increase was not negotiated nor paid until September,
1974. At Cooper Union, bargaining has gone on for over eleven months with no
agreement, no pay raises, just expensive legal talk. ‘ ‘

7.) Contrary to PPU literature, a vote for unionism guarantees that we will pay _a; '

price in the generation of new bureaucracies at'Pitt. We will pay twice, first with
our union dues and second by the drainage on university resources to finance the
new load of legal grievance and procedural work on the "Management" side of the‘
table. At Youngstown State University the new Office of Faculty Personnel already
costs over $70,000 per year just for staff costs.‘The added bill forﬂlegal expenses is
not forseeable; The cost to faculty in lost time can never be measured. I

8.) AFT bargainers record of sensitivity to faculty interests shows some astounding _

‘ineptitudes.'Their bargainers at the Univers_lty of Hawaii negotiated a contract

which cheerfully forfeited most of the traditional'tenure system. When this was dis-.

covered the enraged faculty rejected their union in favor of AAUP. 9 .1 . l

9.)’ The heavy N0 REPRESENTATIVE vote on the first ballot shows that even if
PPU should win it would be representing a divided faculty. It is hard tQ_see how it
could bargain effectively or expeditiously under such circumstances. "

P 10.) In _our previous bulletins we have presented and documented the principal

arguments against unionism at Pitt—the lack of clear financial benefits, centraliza—_
tion of power, insensitivity to faculty—st_udelnt relations, erosion of quality andthe

development of corrosi,ve adversarial relationships. An examination of the AFT.
record suggests that these problems which apply generally to university unions

are aparticularly serious threat of PPU should'be our agent.

We ask that you consider carefully what benefits you can count on with PPU as if

your exclusive agent which can make up for the price which all of the faculty and

the university will probably pay. Remember, unionism will have little effect on the 
administration except to further consolidate its power. Whatever benefits the fac- «
ulty may get from the new power which unionism offers on our side of the table

will be paid for primarily by the faculty and students.

One last point: some may feel uncomfortable voting for NO REPRESENTATIVE
because they do not want to seem to lend their support to the Administration and
its policies. These persons need have no such fear. Fifty—one plus per cent of the

Provost's area faculty voted for one or another of the three union groups inthe -

first election—~a clear warning to the Administrati_on that the faculty are not satis-
fied with the way University affairs are presently conducted. ln,this context, a vote
for NO REPRESENTATIVE is a vote for reform—through internal collegial mech-
anisms and without the AFT’s reliance on confrontation and the threat of strike.
The Administration has already been given its warning: our task now is to keep our
options open by rejecting the AFT’s bid to represent us, and to work together
thereafter to make the University of Pittsburgh the fine environment for teaching
and learning that it is capable of becoming. ' I

A decision for a union is practically an irreversible step.

British guitarist Robin Trower is

you failed to acknowledge the
substantial difference between
Trower and Hendrix, in both style
and music.

terms, never losing his personal
integrity or the sight of “his”
music. Several. typical Pittsburgh
concert idiots were obscenely
yelling, “Boogie .... ..man.....get

smiled. He ﬁnally ignored the
inane requests, playing instead
what he wanted to, namely
space-blues.

squire in blue denim cloak and
hood, with his darker denim jeans
cut off a mid-knee by fringed boots
and hair cut in bangs, Trower, in an
unassuming manner, took the
stage without introduction- Sur-
prisihgly, he opened with his most
popular song, “Day of the Eagle,”
immediately displaying the musical
freedom of the power trio.

difﬁcult for sound to mesh properly
and visually cluttering the stage.
Trower avoids that by employing
only two backing musicians,
Scotsman James Dewar on bass
and lead vocals, and American Bill
Lordan on drums. They provide a
basic rhythm ’n blues base, freeing
Trower to go off on tangents with
his guitar work.

The three form a stunning power
trio, light on the theatrics‘ ' but
heavy on the music. They play
space-blues, which borders on the
progressive with its ability to create

‘moods both soothing and teasing,

yet simple in its ability to
communicate.

Amateur Comics Show

Off At Coffeehouse

BY W. JACK ROMBERG

When Milton Berle ‘puts his
glasses on crooked, we chuckle.
When Monty Python sings about
“spam, spam” the-chuckle turns
into a laugh. And when George
Carlin says “Shiiitl” that’s it—we
are ﬂat out in the aisles.

“Its easy to be funny,” we think

to oarselves as we snap on the

radio and listen to Gabe Kaplan
talk to us about inner ear odor. But
for all our laughs, we tend to forget
that for every David ' Brenner
playing the stages of Vegas and the
studios of Johnny Carson, there are
God -knows how many aspiring
comics begging for the chance to

play even the lowliest club or'

coffeehouse. .
On Friday night, several of these

amateur comedians had a chance to

show their stuff at an event

entitled, “Captain Spaulding Pre-
sents the All Coffee Comedy
House.”

Organized by comic Terry
McAndrews, the evening featured
a variety ‘of comedy acts including
four standup comics, an impres-
sionist and a zany comedy troupe
dubbed La_ckzoom Acidophilus. I

“I organized this partly because
I wanted a place to play,”
M_cAndrews related. “But‘I think

there is a good market for comedy

in this city, and the turnout tonight
shows it.”

McAndrews led off the show

himself, assuming a Carlinesqu%-

consists exclusively of coffee, and I
am unwilling to improve my habits.

The best thing about this book is
that is furnishes about four
hundred recipes for light meals.
About half of them could be done
with no more elaborate equipment
than a hot plate and a frying pan;
most of the rest, including the
bread recipes, could be done in one
of those table-top toaster-ovens. In
almost all cases, the basic recipe is
given in quantities suited to please -
one hungry person or-two average
persons. Rather than divide huge
recipes (what is ohe-fourth of “one
egg-yolk, slightly beaten?") we are
invited to increase and multiply,
should we become numerous.

One of the things I have tested is
their procedure for making yogurt
at home. "The Goldbecks do not
approve of those expensive mach-
ines for making yogurt; instead,

they suggest a half-dozen methods
for getting the same temperature
and same results in your own
home. It works. A half-gallon of
milk, which costs about 90 cents,
yields eight cups of yogurt. Eight
cups of yogurt, at our supermarket,
would cost $3.80.

The Goldbecks are prejudiced in
favor of natural foods, but not to
the point of forcing them on you.
They always give acceptable
substitutes. All in all, even if you
don’t get up early and cheerful
_every morning, this is a good guide
to the manufacture of light and

\ nourishing meals.

I will not complain about the
"price. All books are too expensive.
But this book is about nine inches
wide and ﬁve inches high. It is
limp. It refuses to lie open. Before

you buy it, practice memorizing,

recipes.

The monologue was off and-

McAndrews had performed before,
switching from one story to another
with relative ease. As McAndrews

According to McAndrews, “Try-

of people is one of the most
terrifying experiences in the world.

Your first time can be hell.”

And so it was for several of the

One of the most difﬁcult types of
comedy to perform is impressions.
Not only do your voices have to be
good, the situations in which you
use them have to be funny.

Will Paris in the springtime be as
spectacular as Paris in the fall?
Opinions on the French capital may
vary, but all votes ‘on Maria Paris,

‘the Pantherette tennis superstar,
are more than afﬁrmative.

The team, undefeated during the
fall season, will open the spring
schedule Thursday when they
travel to Lock Haven, and from
Paris‘ terriﬁc performance in the

— last month's Saranac Cup Invita-
‘ . tional, it's safe to judge that she’s
more than ready to go.

“Maria really did well in the
tournament,” first-year coach
Nancy Gorden said. “Sheibeat all
the top players.”

Pitt finished third in the
Invitational, while OSU and Mary-
land took the top slots.

“The whole team did well,”
Gordon added. “We gave Ohio
State quite _a match.”

Abbreviated is a good descrip-
tion of thespring session. The
schedule consists of two regular
matches, a quad-meet at OSU with
Michigan State and Purdue, as well

cf-“Was the host team, and two
 tournaments, the Middle State
Intercollegiate and the National
Collegiate. The former will be
limited to the top players and Paris
alone will travel to Utah for the

latter.
' . The lineup is also condensed

from the fall listing. The athletes
participating are team captain Fran
Baskin, Jan Irwin (who’s been
doubling on the track team), Mary
Sue Ramsden, Paris, and the
doubles team of Terry Lies and Ann
Seebold. The squad has been
working out at the Alpine Raquet
Club during the off—season.

By anyone’s definition, the
schedule is rigid.

“We won't be undefeated this
time,” Gordon judged. “But we
want to start playing a tougher
schedule. It will prove what we can
do. We have_ a couple of good
players in the fall. That should help
us. ' ~

The powerful Indiana Hoosiers,
behind a relentless defense and 16
points from all-American center
Kent Benson, remained undefeat-
ed Saturday, thwarting the UCLA
Bruins, 65-51, to advance to the
NCAA Championships ﬁnal round
tonight against Big-10 rival Michi-
gan.

~The Wolverines gained their
berth by giving the Rutgers Scarlet
Knights something they haven’t
seen all year, a loss, 86-70.
Michigan was paced by John
Robin‘son’s'20 points.

Indiana played almost ﬂawless
basketball, both offensively and
defensively, after a rugged start

.which saw UCLA jump out of a ‘

quick 7-2 lead. Indiana began the
game with Benson covering
UCLA’s own all-American, 6-10

V _ forward Richard Washington.

Washington delivered ﬁve of
those first seven points, and
Benson picked up two quick
personal fouls.

Here Comes Hawk- Again!

BY RON SIEGEL

“Breaker-breaker. This is the
Hawk. I'm puttin the hammer
down, man.‘I’ll be in, your hip
pocket.” ‘

The “Hawk” is Tony Dorsett,
I who, prior to a recent, football
practice, imagined what it would be

like to have a citizens’ band (CB) 1

radio for his planned cross-country
excursion this summer.

On the football ﬁeld, Tony
Dorsett always has the “hammer
down.” Barring serious injury,.he

 will ﬁnish his collegiate career next

’ season as the leading ground-gain-

er in NCAA history. He needs to

average only 9_4 yards per game to

. surpass Archie Grifﬁn’s record of
5,157 career yards.

Just as CB-equipped‘. vehicles
learn well in advance wh’ere trafﬁc

jams and other hazards are located, _

‘ Dorsett has the uncanny sense of
knowing where the holes are.
Several opponents have wondered
if there’s a receiver built into that
blue—and-gold Panther helmet.

Dorsett is now cruising towards
the Heisman Trophy. .He is a team
player ﬁrst, and his contributions
to the team are what makes him a
leading 'Heisman candidate.

There has not been a more
electrifying runner in college
football since O.J. Simpson. Even
Joe Paterno, who wanted badly to
have Dorsett at —Penn State, has
been caught up in the excitement.
During last year’s 34-20 thrashing
of Notre Dame, Paterno at one
point cheered, “Go, Tony, run,
run!" '

The comparisons with Archie
Grifﬁn, two-time Heisman trophy
winner from Ohio State, are
natural, and Dorsett usually comes
out on top. Dorsett’s accelleration

as different types of runners.

“I break my share of tackles, but

Keep the hammer down, Hawk.

the UCLA star. The move worked,
as Washington couldn’t contribute
another ﬁeld goal to the Bruin
-cause until the start of the second
half, as Abernethy popped in 10 of
his game total 14 in the first stanza.

UCLA’s highly touted offense
soon began to ﬂounder and the
Hoosiers opened a lead which held
up for the rest of the game. UP by
six points, 52-46, with but six
minutes left in the contest, the
Hoosiers went into a stall offense to
preserve the victory.

For Indiana, it was their 31st win
this season without a loss, while
the Bruins dropped to 26-5, their
worst record in the past decade.
Indiana has now won 62 of its last
63 games.

Michigan, meanwhile, found the
going a little easier with their
undefeated opponent than did
UCLA.

Rutgers’ “panic defense’? soon
became a picnic for the Wolver-
ines, as Michigan opened up a
commanding lead early in the first
half. Leading by a slim three-point

' margin, 17-14, the Wolverines ran_

Lacrosse, By The Way,
,At Pitt too

Has Atclub

BY JIM LEWIS

It’s called lacrosse. No, it’s ‘not
what you’d ﬁnd on top of a French
church, it’s a sport-—a sport at the
Univesity that, despite the fact that
manystudents and facultycompete
against some of the nation’s top
club teams, is virtually- unknown.

Such is the fate of the Lacrosse
Club; with no money or publicity
from Pitt, it is a sure nominee for
the Obscure Sport of the Year
Award.

Lacrosse is an easy game to
follow} It is an outdoor_ sport,
played with ten men on a
team—three defensem‘en, three
attack-men, three mid-ﬁelders _and
a goaltender. Each player holds an
odd-looking stick—a wood or metal
shaft with a netlat the end. _ I

The game begins when a small

ball is dropped at the center of an
exaggerated football ﬁeld by an

or

A ofﬁcial—like;a face-off in hockey.

One member of each team tries to
scoop the ball up in his stick.

The object of lacrosse is to pass

_the small ball to others with the

stick, using the net as a sort of
catcher's mitt, and try to put it in
the goal guarded by the netminder.
One point is awarded for each goal
sgpred, with the ‘winner after
regulation time (about two«40-m-in-
ute halves) being the one with the
most goals. I

Last week, the club, a member of
the Mid-West Club I.aci-osse
Association (MWCLA), joining
such notables as Notre Dame and
Michigan, defeated arch-rival West
Virginia Univesity handily, 17-10,
at Morgantown in the ﬁrst of their
12-game season.

“We were 6 ahead from the
beginning," said Lacrosse Club
President Bill Markus. “It was an
easy win."

No one in the lacrosse world is
surprisedat the outcome of that
game; Pitt has been a power for a

' year or two. Last year, the team

earned a 10-4 record in the 204team
league, and this year, with starters

The Scarlet Knights’ top three:

total offensive output of 53 points‘,

but were held to just 37 against-_-
Michigan. The combine ﬁeld goal: ’
percentage‘ of the three was an-
embarrassing 13.5% during the‘
ﬁrst half, and the Rutgers team as ‘
a whole could manage to sink -only L

This was the ﬁrst year in NCAA. 
history that two undefeated teams. _ ff
had reached the semi-finals. It is 
also a ﬁrst that two schools from: ‘ E’.
the same national conference will 
face each other in the ﬁnal round...

Tonight’s ﬁnale will be the third '

Doug Cooper (coach of .,the
Sewickley Academy lacrosse team,
and perhaps the best player on the ,1
entire squad), and Mike Shedlosr
key (who played onthe Dartr_no‘uth/
varsity lacrosse team), should have
an even better one. ‘ 0' '

Another reason why this team
will be super-successful '~ is its 
experience. Most of the starting
lineup are graduate students or
have had experience playing *2-I
lacrosse before, like in high school. , p
Such_.is the case of (Olsen, Cooper,

“We have a number‘ of‘ 
undergraduates who've never held .-

 

.a stick in their life,” claimed

Markus.

Even so, everyone better be on
their toes; this season’s_ schedule is a
tough. The Lacrosse Club will
compete against some of the best in
the nation, such as defending
MWCLA champ American-general
Lacrosse Club, who they played
yesterday. One of their three honte:.,f5
games (May 9) is against another 
powerhouse, Bowling Green La-
crosse Club. ‘

 

Lacrosse is a fast, exciting sport 
and fan turnout is rapidly growing,
according to Markus. " ‘

West Virginia have had teams for I
four or ﬁve years now.” ~ I ,7-

resorted to sliding across the
crease to stop the low shots—it was
a goaltending battle in every sense
of the word. , ,

Plasse came out on top, but not
without considerable help from
defensemen Dave Burrows and Ed
Van Impe. Actually, many of the
Red Wings’ scoring attempts never
even reached Plasse, but were cut
off by Burrows or a colleague
sliding in front of the Detroit
shooters. A

The three Penguin goals were
not “cheapies,” but were either set
up by excellent play-making or
blown by the Detroit netminder.
The first goal was set up by some
behind-the-net work by Van Impe
and Schock, who found Stan
Gilbertson alone in the slot for a
ten-foot wrist shot.

The other two goals whistled by
Rutherford with little or no reaction
on his part. ‘First, Rick Kehoe
scored a power-‘play goal late in the
opening period after taking a
drop-pass from linemate Vic
Hadfield. Kehoe slapped a
35-footer which it is doubtful
Rutherford ever saw.

And in the ﬁnal period,_ Pierre
Larouche notched his 47th goal of
the season by sending a booming

final goal.

Missed chances by the Penguins
were numerous. ‘At the 15:46 mark
of the second period, Gilbertson

goal, with the rebound from ob

Former Penguin Jim Rutherford stole the show from Michel Plasse
at the Civic Arena last night, though Plasse turned in a shutout to top
the Red Wings, 3-0, and put the Pens back in second place.

Kelly's shot on his stick, yet shot
the puck into Rutherford’s pads.

Five and a half minutes later,
Larouche, on a partial breakaway,
slid. Elie puck into the sprawling
Detroit goalie. Rutherford robbed
Larouche of this and at least two
other goals. ‘

The win was the Penguins fifth in

their last eight games and gave‘

them a 3-1-1 series record over the
Red Wings, rivals in the Norris

’ Division. The victory also put the

Penguins one point ahead of Los
Angleles,(80-79) in the race for
second place in the division.

HEARST HAD PLANNED
TO LEAVE HARRISES

SAN FRANCISCO (AP)——Patri-
cia Hearst had split with Symbion-
ese Liberation Army “soldiers”
William and Emily Harris and
planned to ﬂee to the East Coast in
the weeks before her arrest,
according to Rolling Stone.

In a copyright article, the
magazine reports that Hearst,
convicted a week ago of bank
robbery, was preparing to leave
San Francisco with Steven Soliah,
traveling first to Oregon and then
to Boston, where they planned to
work as community organizers.

The journey, according to au-
thors David Weir and Howard
Kohn, was to have begun by Oct. 1,
1975. Hearst, the Harrises and
Soliah were arrested here on Sept.
18.

The article is contained in an
issue of the magazine originally
scheduled for release on Thursday.
However, the editors said they
intended to withhold publication of
the article until the jury in Soliah’s
bank robbery trial in Sacramento is
sequestered.

The sterilization drive, part of a
national effort to prevent India's

growing to one billion by 1990, is a
followup to last month’s announce-
ment of a plan to penalize residents
of the capital and government
employes who do not limit their
families to two children.

To stimulate the drive, thous-
ands of teachers have been told to
convince at least five married
persons to voluntarily undergo
sterilization operations during the
month of March, according to B.S.

director for the capital’s adminis-

FBI BURGLARIES OF SWP
REVEALED

WASHINGTON (AP)—The
FBI burglarized offices of the
Socialist Workers Party and its
youth affiliate as often as twice a
month for a total of 92 post-
midnight raids in the early 1960s,
according to newly disclosed FBI
documents.

The documents show that FBI
agents photographed at least 8,700
pages of party ﬁles, including
ﬁnancial records and personal
letters, during the break-ins. It was
not clear from the FBI files whether
agents only photographed or
whether they physically removed
some papers from the offices.

In compliance with a court order,
the FBI provided the party with 354
pages of files describing burglaries
at the New York offices of the party
and the Young Socialist‘ Alliance
and the two house breaking
incidents. A

Albert Einstein was a charter member of the AFT. local at Princeton University.
Einstein recognized the relationship between scientific research, university work-.

 V . ing conditions and governance, and the socio,-political context in which a univer-
 ‘ sity exists.*Asked why he joined the American Federation of Teachers, he replied:

 

 

 

“I consider it important indeed urgently necessary, for intellectual workers
'. to get together, both to protect their onw economic status and, also, gener-
». ally speaking, to secure their influence in the political ﬁeld. ”

(Statement to the National Wartime Conference, May,,1944, cited
