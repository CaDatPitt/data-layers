Curriculum Chan

The Faculty of Arts and Sci-
ences has recently approved
some changes in the curriculum
for the students in the College of
Arts and Sciences. These chang-
es will'be effective for the Spring
Term and will apply to all‘stu-
dents currently enrolled in the
College.

The. Distribution of Studies re-

quirement has been ‘modified so

that only nine (9) credits are re-.

quired in each of the three learn-
ing areas — humanities. natural
sciences. and" social sciences.
Credits must be taken in a mini-
mum of three departments in
each aerea. Also. an interdiscip-
linary course may be substitut-
ed. as under the present regula-

Trespassers Will

A bill was introduced ,into the
State Legislature last week de-

signed to aid university presi-.

dents in controlling campus dis-
orders. The bill, introduced by
Rep. Herbert Fineman and co-
sponsored by Rep. K. Leroy Ir-
vis. would make treapassing on
the campus of any educational
institution a summary offense.
The trespasser would be subject
to a_ fine of $100 or one day in
jail.

The bill was drawn up after a
group of meetings Fineman and
Irvis held with college presidents
and student leaders from colleges
throughout the state. It would cov-
er all types of educational insti-
tutions. basic and secondary
schools and colleges. and public.

and private institutions.

The bill, according to Fineman,
is _, considered necessary by . col-
lege presidents because ' “they
believe that much of the unrest is

fomented by outsiders who enter

the campuses with the sole inten-
tion of causing trouble.”

“Because educational
tions are not covered by our tres-
pass laws, they were powerless
to oust the intruders without post-
ing the premises. which is in-
consistent with an academic

institu-I

tion. for a departmental course
in meeting this requirement.
Students may elect any course
for which they have met the stat-
ed departmental prerequisite.
Any courses other than English
1-2. languages 1-2-3-4-10-ll. ’

P. Ed. 1-2, or 90’s and 1905 will
count towards DOS in the respec-
tive areas. '

it a trespass if a person refused
to leave the grounds or buildings
of an educational system or if
they entered the grounds or build-

ings when they were ordered not ’

to do so.

Religion Hits

‘New’ Notes

By MIKE EDELSTEIN
Staff Feature Writer

The case for a separate department.

of religion at the University was made
by Professor Jacob Neusner of Brown
University in.his Monday evening address
in the SU Supper Room. 

Sponsored by the Pitcairn-Crabbe Lec-
ture Foundation, Dr. Neusner termed the
study of religion “an adventure." Since
1945 the study of religion has spread from
Southern state universities to "almost
all state universities." The response to
these courses has been “overwhelming"
because “The dogma that if you study re-
ligion you are involving yourself in relig-
ious experience . . . has passed from the
scene. . 

Calling for the “establishment of a de-
partment of religion meeting the same
high standards as found elsewhere in the
University,” Neusner noted that present-
ly at Pitt “There is _no doubt that religion
is being taught; the question is how so-
phisticated are the people who are teach-
ing it. No self-respecting University will
permit the study of religion to be in the
hands of amateurs.”

Why does the author of 10 books on re-
ligion believe such a department is essen-
tial? In Neusner‘s opinion the study of re-
ligion produces  . .freedom-to shape one’s
own ideas independent of those imposed
by upbringing. environment or peer—group
values.“ _ . '

In the university. religion is taught
differently than in the religious institu-
tion. Rather than participation, the uni-
versity scholar seeks understanding of re-
ligiousistructures. Scholarly method rath-

er than content is stressed. Not ethn’ocen- " '

The “left" met the "right" as Dr. Da-
vid Houston. University Professor of Eco-
nomics. debated Dr. Philip Crane. former
History Professor at Indiana and Bradley
Universities. and Board of Directors mem-
ber of the American Conservative Union.
They discussed “To What Extent Should
the Student Be Free to Determine His
Environment at the University," Monday
night in the SU Dining Room A.

"Students ought to have a right in deter-
mining their environment.“ Houston be-
gan. "Students are citizens in a commu-
nity. Why should they be treated as a spe-
cial class and have different rights?"

Houston commented that many people
feel that someone else is paying for the

student‘s education and thatthis payment --

has to some extent bought the student.
“This premise needs serious question-
ing.“ Houston said.

Houston added that the Student Power
movement is on three levels: personal,
internal, and extremist.

According to Houston students are
revolting against loco parentis in the Uni-
versity because the administration has
been doing a lot of _things which they have
no right to do. Houston cited the women’s
personal files as an example, and empha-
sized that the student rights movement is
succeeding and the administration is play-
ing a lesser role in social regulation.

Feeling that reform within the Univer-
sity is necessary, Houston added that
students are attempting to make the power
structure more democratic in relation to
the Board of Trustees and. the curricu-
lum. ' '

Still, “other students are rebelling

_' against-"the "evils of society, such as ra-~
_  cism. and militarism, by trying to”.elim.-

versity will be a model for society but  I —.i'

will not change society.”

Houston added that some students feel 
that the University must act as an instru_- 

ment for changing society.

Alluding to the question of morality,‘

Houston said that taking over a building -. I:

is interfering with other people’s civil lib-

erties but that interference is not neces-_ ' ‘P

sarily wrong. Houston made an analogy
between taking over a building and the fact-

that people today would praise men who‘ 

interfered with the inhumane tactics of th
Nazis during World War II. ' _ T

Crane feels that there is some valid-‘  
ity in the idea of “money buying.” He said, A "1 "
“the state can provide opportunity for edu-— 
cation. The students’ don’t pay their. own 

 

-way; therefore the taxpayers have a say  
'in what goes on at the University. Genuine 

‘guidelines, such as obscenity, do exis_t'in.- ;

society and in the University.” ' ~

Comparing. the Klu Klux , Klan to stu .  if

 

dent radicals, Crane said that society -con‘-‘I 3 .}..‘f

the law into their own hands.

“There are rules and regulations mu-in 
‘ tual for all. An individual can protest the ?

laws in court but a mob is destructive to‘

everyone.” Crane added, “rules havebeen; :55

  Heterosexual Audience

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Staff News Writer

A heterosexual audience of
more than 200 people crowded in-
to the SU Ballroom to learn about
contraception from Dr. Ronald
Chez, gynecologist from the Uni-
versity School of Medicine last

. Thursday. Dr. Chez was one of

the series of speakers who have
been sponsored by the Sex and

Sexuality Committee 0
YWCA.

The speaker explained that the
second method, withdrawal or coi-
tus interruptus, is practiced safely
in European countries. The dan-
ger in this is directly related to
the discipline of the male.

Then there’s the purely mech-
anical method of the condom.
Although rubbers are harmless

and easy to use and obtain. the
disadvantage lies in the possi-
bility of slippage.

Although, said Dr. Chez. the
diaphragm has ten percent failure
rate. this is attributable to the en-
largement of the cervex in the wo-
man during intercourse over
which the diaphragm is placed
by the physician.

He discouraged creams, jel-

ter understand the society for
which they will be desigiriing

Chez said in conclusion.

Racism ‘Prominent’

  Smith-—‘Face Up To It’

by JOY MANDEL
Staff News Writer

Racism is as prominent’ in
.politics as in other areas of life.
claimed Henry Smith. Democrat-
ic candidate for Judge of the Court
of Common Pleas of Allegheny
County. At a Pitt Young Demo-
crats lecture Thursday, Smith not-
ed that racists exist in any or-
ganization and "blacks must face
up to it, and do what they can to
overcome it.

According to Smith. represen-
tation in government is not in
proportion to the black population
in urban areas. Greater gains are

at the bottom and work up.”
Blacks,‘ he explained, should start
at a precinct or committee level
and work up to the ward level,
and. ultimately, the city level.
where they, could have some effect
on major decisions.

A major cause of discontent
in the black community- systems
from the exclusion of blacks from
major decision making bodies.
Stated Smith. He cited the Ker-

ner Report, a survey of twenty- .

three citiesinvolved in,civil dis-
orders in 1967, as listing the fail-
ure to involve blacks as the sixth
most important reason for black

Following the lecture, the floor
was opened for questions.

Someone from the audience
stated that the Kerner report pre-
sented a rather black outlook for
the future of American cities and
asked Smith if he agreed. Smith
did agree saying that a state of
emergency will exist as long as
“you still have things that lead to
discontent.

An Open Letter To Jewish 
Students At The University

The author of "An Open Letter to Arab
students at the University" (published.
March 19) was annoyed because the Arab
students had distributed leaflets showing
Arab children killed by napalm, and a
quotation from the Manchester Guardian
dealing with the subject of the inhuman
treatment the Arab civilians get from their
Israeli conquerors.

tory. New York Times, March 3, 1969)

As it can be clearly seen, the inhuman
character of Zionism and Nazism is the
same, having in common specially the
philosophy of expansionism. The map of the
Middle East shows that Israel in June 1967
became three times larger than it was
before. Israel found an excuse for doing

We believe people are also entitled to
know about the Arab side of the coin.

To deny the Nazi character of Israel and
its fanatic Zionist ideology, the defender
of the Israeli cause went into fabrication
of an endless list of names and events, with-
out any documentation. As to what is meant
by ISRAELI NAZISM, let us explain it
to the young philosopher: Nazism was de-
dicated to erect a German empire and make
it,Jewish free. Zionism is dedicated to es-

timate object of erecting the Israeli Em-5‘
pli‘e_. (Moshe Dayan, Israel Defense
Minister. talk over the Israel Radio Broad-
cast, Feb. 12, 1952)

Nazism in its effort to erect the Ger-
man empire brought disaster to Europe.
Zionism’ inrits effort_ to erect the Israeli
empire (as Dayan put it), has brought war,
hate, misery to the people in the Middle
East and a threat to world peace.

The only free university that will ever exist is the one within the individual, but

without the work of others, it would be much more difficult to obtain.

There will always be different elements of a society, with each element feeling

1 that its way is the right way, and that the others are wrong.

As it is defined by our religions, societies and laws, there is no right or wrong.

These two words can only be defined by the individual. 4

High schools should only go up to tenth grade. All students should then attend
either a trade school or junior college for two years, and college as it now exists should
be for only three years—with no requirements.

Draft, drug, and liquor laws should be radically revised, as sh

ould the voting laws.

tablish an Israeli empire and make it Chris-
tians and Moslems free. That is why the
Zionist evicted one million "Palestinian
Arabs, who live now as refugees from their
homes in Palestine, to establish a pure Jew-_
ish state. The way these evicted people
were treated is evident in the statement by
the famous British historian, author of A
Study of History, Arnold Toynbee: “The
Jewish treatement of the Arabs in 1948
was as morally indefensible as the slaugh-
ter by the Nazis of six million Jews.”

ter to the Editor of Los Gatos Times,
Saratoga Observer (August 31, 1967), sta-
ted: "Prophetic Judaism is my religion,
not napalm Judaism. The Jewish nation-
alists, the new specimen of fighting Jews,
are not Jews as far as I am concerned, but
Jewish Nazis who lost all sense of Jewish,

morality and humanity.” He also added:‘'5

“Anti-Zionism is not anti-semitism. ”
We hope this will explain to Mr. Smolo-
ver what was meant by the statement:

(From lecture delivered at McGill Uni-
versity’ in January of 1961). Also, let me
remind Mr. Smolover, at this point, of the

demn Israel for its inhuman treatment of

In Search of Myself

by MARC SIMON

In this last winter term issue, I’m going to take this opportunity to say something
‘serious for once. Well, I’m going to try to tell how to find the sunshine. 1

It seems to me that first one has to get oneself together. In search of the perfect
whole to which we might yield ourselves, we have to realize our pettyand not so petty
hangups. Everything. Sex. drugs, war, peace, the Virgin Birth. everything. I mean, look

, at ourselves, and expand, not blow, our minds. We’ve got to lose our inhibitions, or fears.

'1 our prejudices, our shortcomings — in other words, we’ve got to step outside of ourselves
and take an objective look at what’s ticking off our vibrating essences. We’ve got to un-
derstand through our divine binocular vision what’s in, what’s out and what our prior-
ities are. ‘

Then We’ve got to groove. Groove on ourselves. The only thing we know, we
really know,, is that we are. No matter what we do, we are, I am you are, he, she, it is.

Get rid of your hangups. Get rid of your inhibitions. Abstract your life. Don't
be content to slurp, burp, and then ursurp life's offered complacency. Go astray. Search.
Drink your life even to the dregs, and then groove on what you are. '

We are free. We have minds. We are human beings. There's the sunshine.

by BRUCE LEVENSON

Associate Editor

The University of Pittsburgh
today stands at a crossroads —
between a past of apathy and a
present of increased involve-
ment. The next academic year
will be critical in determining
the course of the future.

The “student
power” move-
ment of the past
year has been
the focal point
of the trend to-
ward involve-
ment. The stu-
dent suddenly
.realized that
his status at
the University was that of a sec-
ond-class citizen. He found that
his feelings and opinions carried
little weight in the decision-
making processes that affected
his education.

The faculty found that their
power was more in form than in
substance. An ROTC disacredita-
tion vote in December that the
administration has been try-

' ing to reverse ever since is proof
g enough of that. ’

  

 

THEREFORE, THE ADMINIS-

ITRATION (and rightly so) has
.been cast as the villian. While

working through established chan-
nels to initiate change, faculty
and students have been met with

endless doubletalk. strangling
ribbons of red tape, bureau-
cratic inertia. and administra-

tive antipathy to change in any
way. shape. or form.

On a widely apathetic campus
such as this one a year ago, a
movement of involvement caught
the administration completely
off-guard and exposed it as ill-
equipped to confront the new situ-
ation. The administration had
long been accustomed to dealing
with students who wanted to be
regulated and faculty who didn't
see teaching as their first priority.

The studeng body contented it-
self with a sandbox Student Gov-
ernment that accomplished lit-
tle, a Pitt News that served as a
house organ, and a Dean of Stu-
dents office that arbitrated mor-
ality. The name of the game was
QPA and the rules had to conform
to that purpose.

THE FACULTY SERVED_ as a
tool to produce the grades. The
methodology of instruction was

rarely questioned. The content of
courses was. rarely questioned.
Curricular reform lay in the prov-
ince of the deans and the faculty.
The performance of a professor
is not measured by, his ability to
teach or even his ability to turn
out grades for that matter. but
in terms of tenure and publica-
tion.

The s t u d e n t-faculty power
movement has demanded that the
administration reverse, 'direc-
tion. Many of the men who had
risen to positions of administra-
tive power because of their abili-
ties to serve as surrogate parents
had suddenly become obsolete.
The administration as a whole is
having tremendous difficulty in
dealing with the new type of stu-
dent or teacher, with the old
methods. This is probably the
reason for recent personnel
changes in the bureaucratic hier-
archy.

The movement originated with
a handful of people whose ideas
eventually gained a support and

legitimacy from Student Gov-
ernment, The Pitt News The
Arts and Sciences Cabinet.

the Black Action Society. and

members of the faculty. The_

movement is no longer the pos:

; ession of a lheft-wing. minority. but

of a large population that tran-
scends all sectors of the Univer-
sity community. Today the ob-
jectives of that movement are ‘in-
creasingly moving toward real-
ity.

THOUGH THE LINES of com-

‘ munication are still far from per-

fect, though the struggle has been
hard-fought and oftentimes fought
uncleanly, a new pattern appears
to be, rapidly emerging. Piece by
piece students and faculty have

been getting that voice in de-'
cision-making that has been sought.

Witness a Student Govern-
ment that has been largely trans-
formed into a viable tool for
change. the Undergraduate Coun-

' cil. a Social Committee that ac-

tually regulates social rules. the
"Open University." new Faculty
By-laws. and a Board of Direc-
tors consisting of students. fac-
ulty and administration to deter-
mine Book Center policy.

Whether the majority of stu-
dents and faculty are in favor of
this movement or not. one fact be-
comes clear. Mechanisms are

changing. Students and faculty are .

being given a greater voice in
matters that effect them. And this
is a voice ‘that can be utilized by

any student-_ ~01: P faculty’ member V

   
  

of any persuasion‘ that evidences

the willingness and the ability to
use it.

But, the future appears cloudy

because of ‘the lingering pres— ~

ence of apathy. Too many‘ of the
members of the movement have
shown an ability to protest but lit-
tle else. People will be needed
to fulfill these new positions of re-
sponsibility. Unfortunately, many
of the old positions of responsi-
bility are presently unfulfilled or
inadequately fulfilled.
a Weekend-At-Pitt Committee that
took months in finding volun-
teers. an Off-Campus Housing
Committee, that consists of only a
chairman. a Pitt News that is all
too frequently put out by only
four or five people. and many
SG Committee jobs that go beg-
ging.

THE DAYS OF full administra-
tive culpability are numbered_
The destiny of the goals of the
movement and of the future of
the.University now largely lies
in the hands of the students and
faculty. These two groups have

Black Studies Unofficial

Editor. The Pitt News:
This letter is to clarify the ar-

ticle “CAS Offers Black Studies" »

which appeared in the March 29.
1969 issue of The Pitt News. As
a result of this article our office
has received a number of calls
from students who want to know
if these are courses which have
been sanctioned by our office. Ap-
parently this article plus the

’ article on page seven of the same

issue, which announced Mr.
Porter’s and my appointment, led
people to believe that we had
sanctioned these courses as part of
the Black Studies curriculum.

We of this office are not aware
(that information being myster-
iously lost in whiteness voids at the
University) whether it is or was
CAS idea to lable these tradition-
ally racist - course offering as
Black Studies or whether it was
the brain deformity of The Pitt
News. However, one thing is
certain, Black Studies at this
University is being developed and
researched by those people chosen
to so by the Black -Action So-
ciety and those people are Black
and are by no means CAS. There-
fore -we inform those students in-
terested in Black Studies that
what The Pitt News and the
CAS terms Black Studies is a con-
tinuance of paternalistic pap and
has absolutely nothing to do
with Black Studies as determined
by Black people at this Univer-
sity and its surrounding Black com-

' munities.

In the interest of information
we will say that certain course of-

-.

ferings at this University have
been reviewed with an eye toward
inclusion in the Black studies of-
fering. Those which have pas-
sed the test of Blackness include
Speech 115 (Black Rhetoric).
Music 84. (the study of Black
Music) and Soc. 185. ( primar-
ily a study of white racism). We
have tried to bridge a number of
possible gaps between irrelevance’
and relevant Black education by
requesting that the departments
which offer the courses mention,-
ed in your article and all other
prospective offerings submit a
copy of their proposals and a syl-
abbus in order that we can
consider such courses for in-
clusion or exclusion in Black '
Studies. If‘ the courses" mention-
ed in The Pitt News articles have
hopes of being included we sug-
gest that they comply with these
guidelines.

Least we forget, let us remem-
ber May 20, 1968 and January 16.
1969. Black people at this Uni-
versity have seen the need to
make education relevant and in-
clusive of the needs of the Black
Community beyond the screen of
the monlothic. entrenched status
quo. We begin by co-operative
and creative efforts to develop a
Black Studies program in the form
that it will meet the needs’ of
Black relevant education as an alter-
native to mind numbing racism.
We also move‘ through actual re-
search and concern for these needs:
we do not begin with deception
and tricknology: let it be known.

Editor. The Pitt News,_

The editorial in your issue of March 26 seems to imply that
I resigned in protest over administration policies. Nothing could
be further from the truth. At a large meeting of students some
weeks ago someone described me as an honest man. You must.
therefore. believe that I resigned for the reasons given. Iiwill
send my medical history to anyone who sends me a self-address-
ed envelope! The plain truth is that I am getting to look more and
more like my picture in The Pitt News.

Let me take this opportunity to say that during my long stay
at the University I have had six chancellors shot out from under me.
Wesley Posvar is by far the best of the lot. I fully support him.
Please try to understand what he is doing and help all you can.
He is a fine chancellor and needs your support.

Please try to understand the nature of a modern university.
in particular its changing character and the need for uncontrolled
constructive dissent. and explain it to those outside the Univer-
sity community when opportunity arises. This University has a
greatfuture; support it against the Philistines.

Dean. Faculty of Arts and Sciences
P. S. The Chancellor is also an honest man!

Sincerely yours.

 Faculty Role Should Be Studied

Discussion at the Free University centered around the role of the
Trustees and the administration in perpetuating the existence of the
present educational system. However, little attention was devoted to

V the role played by the faculty which is a real locus of power at the uni-

versity. Today, almost all essential decisions about the curriculum,

committees or chairmen. In ad-

 dition it is the faculty senate and-

or departmental committees or

 chairmen that determine the rel-
gative emphasis placed upon re-

search and teaching, the stand-

.ards for student admissions and

graduation, and most important-
ly, the standards for the selection

I  _ and promotion of faculty members.

Hence, real power lies with the

 -A7 . faculty.

9 Significant faculty presence has
been a noticeably resounding

1  . echo of ‘ silence. Unfortunately,

students who push for curri-
culum study and restructuring of-
ten seem to presume that the

 sympathies of the faculty lie in
f their camp. These assumptions

may-very well be false. Those stu-

 T‘ dents who are seriously concern-

ed about educational reform would

 do well to shift the locus of their
-~  attention and efforts from the of-

ten nebulous geist-like power of
the trustees toward the pregnant
potentials inherent in those with
whom they meet every day in the

A. '‘ classroom. Where do the major
' -elements of the faculty stand on

the issues outlined by the recent

.4" Free University ? What are their
ig: positions, and how will
act upon them. The answer to
,.'these questions as well as the
 -, existential consequences must be

Our .Mistake

Editor. The Pitt News,

On Friday, March 21, you pub-
lished an article titled, “Gradu-
ate Education Council Tackles
Apathy.”

Would you publicly allow me
to dissassociate myself from the
article asit was published? I ask
this for the following reasons:

«.

1. The article was written
by me as a member of the Dean‘s
Advisory Council not as a “Mem-
ber, International Education
Program” (this is a meaningless
identification, inaccurate and in
this instance embarrassing for
those in the International and De-
velopment Education Program).

2. Your careless editing pen and
shears were responsible for; shor-
tening the original article to the
point of disjointed absurdity: bad
spelling _; an inadequate title;
and misrepresentation —- where did
the original article say that the cur-
rent Council was apathetic?

Having published a good deal
of material I’m well aware of
editorial prerogatives. In this in-
stance however I think that you
might have contacted me before
the emasculation so that I had

the opportunity to withdraw. It

was in your hands well before

publishing deadline.
Sincerely.

Parking Solution

Editor. The Pitt News,

Last Tuesday night I parked
on a yellow line outside the lib-
rary for 5 minutes while I ran
inside to tell my study date to
wait for me while I find a legal
place to park. When I ran back
to my car. I noticed a policeman
writing out a ticket. I calmly told
him of my dilemma and asked that
he not give me the ticket. Noti-
cing that I was a college student.
which means that I am a com-
munistic. pot head. the officer
placed the ticket into my plead-

ing hands. He then began his task
of tagging every car on the yel-
low line. I say “task" because this

yellow line stretches from the lib-
rary to Altoona. If' there was an
award for the longest yellow
line. this one would win. It is al-
so a useless line. It was prob-
ably put there originally to help

curb over stocked inventories in

the yellow paint industry.

But the p_olice have a problem.
They do not want students to drive
into Oalkand because they are

S icles With Arabs

Editor. The Pitt News,

I am in possession of one of
those leaflets distributed on the
Pitt campus on March 13. with
the statement in red Stop Israeli
Nazism In Palestine, subject of
Mr. Alan Smolover's “An Open
letter to Arab Students at the Uni-
versity." (The Pitt News — March
19.)

I take this opportunity to sin-
cerely congratulate those "Arab
students“ who have being suc-
cessful in starting to get their
“viewpoint“ known.

So, far, all we hear about -—
through the news media, whatever
it may be — is “the public square
hangings in Bagdad, or the Mach-
a'ned Yehudah market bombing in
Jerusalem, or dead Hebrew Uni-
versity students in a supermarket
. . . . .” but seldom do we find
articles or pictures of those “cruel”
scenes as that one of the real —
not “supposed,” as Mr. Smolover
puts it-victims of napalm bombs,
which I had the opportunity to
see in health centers and refugee

1 camps in Amman, during my re-

cent trip to the Middle East.

"I am totally opposed« to in-
nocent suffering anywhere." I
also agree; and thusly. I think we
should have in mind:

What the police should do to
prevent this 2

1. Put mine fields all along
yellow lines.

2. Any car that is over parked
should be towed and dropped in-
to Panther Hollow.

3. Make the penalty for any
traffic violation 4 years imprison-
ment. By the time the offend-
er is released, he probably will
be drafted.

I Uh-Oh!

Editor, The Pitt News,

On Friday evening, March 21,
the Black Action Society held an
African Dance Program at the
Student Union. I was able to
attend the first half of the per-
formance and found it to be
superb.

At intermission I was told not to
return as the show was for Blacks
only. I saw others similarly re-
buffed before and during the in-
termission which clearly explain-
ed my initial observation of an all
Black Audience. I assume that I
was permitted entry to the first
half because I was accompanied
by a Black child.

This is a clear case of Univer-
sity sponsored segregation. I
think this policy should be ex-
amined.

A   Report Saggests Remedy To Problem

Simmonds Protests

Protesting English class ra-
tios such as 95 students to one
faculty member, Dr. James D.
Simmonds, English professor.
has prepared a report calling at-
tention to the situation and ad-
vancing suggestions to remedy
the problem

Dr. Simmonds‘ report empha-
sizes ",that “the personnel situ-
ation in the English Department
constitutes a genuine crisis for
the university. This is the univer-
sity’s biggest department, and the
most understaffed."

He states that,in the undergrad-
uate literature and writing cours-
es, “the increase in enrollments
has exceeded the increase in full-
time faculty, and the student—fac-
ulty ratio has worsened, not im-
proved.” He also points out, how-
ever,- that although the number
of students in sections has been
reduced, it is due in“-.rpart to en-
larging “reliance on part-time
faculty,” who ,are “less commit-
ted to the university and the pro-
fession, and who do not partici-

pate at all in ‘the life of the de-
partment.‘ “

Dr. Robert F. Whitman, chair-
man of the'English Department,
stated to THE PITT NEWS that
he believed part-time faculty are
not necessarily less qualified than
full-time, and are sometimes need-
ed to teach professionally-slanted

courses like journalism and other‘

writing forms. He agreed, howev-
er, with the majority of the re-
port.

“Dr. Simmonds‘ message on
the whole comes through well,”

asserted Whitman. “There is a
serious understaffing in other
departments in the University,
but the English Department has
the worst student—faculty ratiol”

English Class Ratio

The 32-page unofficial report
suggests that "ideally, all of the
department’s teaching should be
done by full-time faculty and
teaching assistants,” and gives
evidence to Penn State, among
other state and out-of-state
schools, which staffs “all under-
graduate classes beyond freshman
level with full-time faculty, and
employs only eight part-time_peo-
pie to teach sections of Fresh-
man English.“

‘To solve the ratio problem, Dr.
Simmonds proposes that the Eng-
lish department obtain “an iron

‘clad, written guarantee under-

written by the Dean, the Provost,
and the Chancellor, (and, if neces-
sary, by the Board of Trustees),

the University should reach a ra-

Until two weeks ago, Schnee-
wind would not have imagined

that he would be appointed dean _

of the College of Arts and Sci-
ences.

He views his new post as a
short-term special assignment in
which his office will act as “a
funnel to take in new ideas.” He
will serve as dean of the College
for only three or four years dur-
ing which time he hopes to es-
tablish a new and more useful
curriculum for the University.
After positive changes are insti-
tued, Schneewind plans to return
to full-time teaching. While serv-
ing as dean, he will be teaching
one philosophy course per term.

On the concept of an under-
graduate education, Schneewind
believes that the years spent in
college would be as “rich and
free as possible. Education should‘
be for finding more about your-
self and the whole wealth that
men have discovered through the

“YOUR UNDERGRADUATE education represents the last free explora-
tory years you are to have. They should offer rich and free possibilities

for education . .

. I am extremely anxious for the curriculum review com-

your place in it.”

Schneewind ' sees no way of
avoiding specialization but cau-
tions that “it shouldn’t take up so

much time that you can’t ade-

quately look into a lot of other
things.”

Instead of promoting his own
ideas on curriculum reform,
Schneewind plans to entertain
any suggestions made by students
andfaculty. “Lots of students and
lots of faculty are to be consult-
ed,” he indicated. “I don’t plan
to ask the administration.”

Student feedback, he feels, is
important to his new role. “We

will be exploring new methods
that are proposed for curriculum
reform. The faculty is delighted
to see the new activity on the part
of the student body. Apathy is be-
ing shaken out—and this is a good
thing.”

The new dean thinks that a
good way to combat apathy would
be for the administration to take
action on curriculum reform.
Therefore, Schneewind is anxious-
ly awaiting the establishment of
the curriculum review commit-
tee. After the committee has been
formally set up, open hearings
will be held in which all students
will be encouraged to attend and
voice their opinions.

From Bruno 1And Tea

(Editor's Note: George Lies, a senior
writing major has been around the Univer-
sitv community for several years. He has
had many remembrances, many misgivings
and many thoughts about Pitt.

(In this article, one of the last articles of
his collegiate career, he puts the present
Pitt situation into perspective.)

by GEORGE LIES
Contributing Editor

It was a bright, sunny day that Mon-
day afternoon. And the then Chancel-
lor Edward A. Litchfield was hosting
his annual tea party on the Student
Union lawn. It was called the “get to
meet the Chancellor” affair. My moth-
er, at the time proud to have a son at
Pitt, took him up on the invitation.

“Oh, I got to meet Chancellor
Litchfield today,” I remember her say-
ing a very humorous and naive way.

 “He even shook myhand,” she
said, sarcastically.

Well folks, that was the Pitt image
several years. Brunch, tea parties. And
photographs of Chancellor Litchfield
making the “V” sign from his Pitt Sta-
dium boii.

IT WAS AN IMAGE,like God has
. almost. It
was an‘ image, like the President al-
lows. Honored . . . almost. It was an
image, typical of U.S. colleges at the
time. Aloof . . . almost. But not quite;

Yes the image .was important. Un-

der the late Dr. Litchfield Pitt had’

changed its streetcar school appear-
ance and became a place on the’ map.
He scheduled a vast plan for physical
facility expansion, established high ad-
mission requirementsgand almost went
out of business.

DR. LITCHFIELD, a greatly hon-
ored and much maligned gentleman,
was the man of ideas. He wanted Pitt
to be a graduate school, period. He
cared little for undergraduate studies,
and this was evident when:

——Pitt’s admission office went out and
recruited the Northeastern Jewish
students, the only ones who could

meet the strict requirements and still ‘

afford the astronomical tuition ex-
penses at the time.

'I‘IIli lllllllltlllll

coiviine soon to. SHADYSIDE

—Pitt began to phase out certain areas
of undergraduate studies. Business
went. Journalism went. (Engineer-
ing was to be the last, because it" was
and still is the strongest unit of the
University. )

—Pitt went into debt, failing to pay
bills for the many buildings built
and planned and then letting other
things “ride.”

But it shouldn’t be said that Dr.
Litchfielddid Pitt a wrong deed or a
disservice. He had to go into debt,
otherwise hecould never change this
place. He brought the best people here
and created a fine—at that time—cur_ri-
culum. But what has happened to Pitt
since then is a rather large question.

Dr. Litchfield was fired. The Me-
dieval Age set-in and nothing was ac-
complished at this school for years.
His exit left a vacuum, filled for a

few months by an Acting Chancellor,
the much celebrated Stanton Craw-
ford, who died. And then filled by ac-
countant Dr. David Kurtzman who act-
ed as a Chancellor for about one and
a half years. *

IN THOSE DAYS, the school sput-
tered progressively backwards. There

was no consistency. It was as stagnant
as Carnegie Museum. Fortunately in
1.967, the board of trustees‘ and certain
clear—thinking administrators—particu-
larly Dean David Halliday—chose a

‘real chancellor in Dr. Wesley Posvar.

He is the type of_,man who—barring
singing concerts—can put Pitt on the
map once again. That is, if he isn’t
fired because of the happenings of the
past year. .

Dr. Posvar, a future thinking indi-
vidual, was forced to come to grips
with all those problems never solved

. during the Medieval Age.

—His biggest thorn is Harrisburg
now that the school is relatedgt‘

more problems, including: 

—The “brat-like” attitude of the biac
studies program. I 

—The “concerned students” wno..s§¢’”

—The recruitment of more professor
and new administrators who ’w_o‘n;’
back out the back door when thing
get hot. ' I 

-—The polishing-up of programs initi
ated by him and his own people. 

IN THE PAST, Pitt people could‘
never think on their own. “We’re_-no
looking at what Harvard’s doing to-gé
ideas this time,” said the ‘.‘retiring’

Dean Kiehl recently.  ;_,

The importance of just what thi
school year has meant lies in the fact;-:
that for the first time, the real eyes of;

the University are opened. There: i‘

greater freedom among undergrad

uates, above the freshman level. And;
this comes in direct contrast to the neo-.,
conservative atmosphere of the citylof}

Pittsburgh, that faction which comes:

into play only during the .wintei_"'

months when it needs vaults of moniesj:
to fill its potholes with tar. , * ‘

THE WAY I SEE IT the University
is trying to right itself through. it
sophomore populace. These are th’
ones who are running the school right
now. They have asked for responsibil-;?
ity, and now they have it. A

What they do with that responsible;

tain. The administration is waiting,
eagerly to see what happens. '  r 1‘

This is the Pitt picture as the school._‘
ends its most fascinating year—the"y'ea .
of the open mind. -   ‘

In past years, I have always said
that Pitt could be a better school. May
be now this will be realized. But there 1:
are "still people here who did quite ‘a-
lot of sleeping during the Medieval;
Age. The best thing for Pitt would be‘
to get rid of them. .. ’  

Yet even with their exeunt, the Un_i.- ,
versity’s trivialities will continue ‘. . .
there will be those administrators wl_1o'_
say one thing and then do another . .j. i
there will be those others who cop ‘
pleas . . . and there will be those stu-,_»
dents who shirk their responsibilities. I

AND HERE LIES THE KEY to a
university. If the student can attain:
status with the University community,'_
then he must contribute his share. This
is a responsibility. But if the idea of’,

University is not a community. Ra‘th’er’,_'.?‘

The Issues

Of TheCollege Of Arts and Science

(FAS Council Nomination

Three Crucial Issues

By ROBERTA SALPER
Assist. Prof. of Hispanic Languages

The March 14 draft of the FAS by-
laws is a considerable improvement
over the original one. However, the
draft as it now stands still falls short
of the desired goal of creating a docu-
ment that will provide for - even in-
sure —— organic interaction between

students, faculty and administration-
because it does not deal adequately-

with three crucial areas: budget, dis-
cipline, and student participation.

Amendment 1 requests that the FAS
have jurisdiction over budget; that
the FASC should have the right to re-
view the budget and recommend chang-
es, and finally, that an itemized state-
ment of receipts and expenditures be
made available to all members of the
FAS by the Dean. ‘

This would allow for general un-
derstanding of departmental distribu-
tion of funds and clearly point up pos-

sible» needs for reallocation. The Uni-«

versity budget would be presented in
a manner easily comprehensible to
non-economists and could conceivably
correct injustices inadvertently over-
looked by the small number of people
now responsible for its administra-
tion. Furthermore, the publication of
a yearly budget is a practice common
to our national government and an in-
trinsic part of democratic practices.

Amendment 2 concerns discipline.
Faculty discipline — “moral” and
“academic” — is currently handled
by an Ad-Hoc committee whose com-

position is vague. It appears that the-

FAS Dean names to this committee
“persons relevant” to the affair in
question, and usually includes several
members of the Faculty Tenure Com-
mittee. ‘

To my knowledge no fixed regula-

tions exist concerning social or aca—.

demic discipline for graduate students.

Three Violations of Democratic Procedur

By DAVID BRAMHALL
Doctor of Economics

“As we set new directions, the important deci-
sions must be reached through democratic discus-
sion and intellectual persuasion — not through ad-

ministrative dictate” . . .

‘Wesley W. Posvar ‘ 2
University Times
Vol. 1, No. 2, March 1969

The letter and the spirit of the Chancellor’s state-
ment is clearly violated by the University adminis-
tration heads in the way they are handling the enact-
ment of the internal regulations of the FAS‘.

Three vital issues have been pre-empted through
administrative dictate long before the bylaws and
amendments will come up for democratic discus-
sion at the full meeting of the Faculty of Arts and

Sciences on April 7.

1. COMPOSITION OF THE VOTING BODY.

Paragraph two of the bylaws specifically in-
cludes instructors among members of the Faculty.
The first draft of the bylaws circulated on Febru-
ary 18 stated that “Those named in paragraph two
will be eligible to vote unless a motion to exclude
some group is carried.” Without waiting. for such a
‘motion, or unsure of being able to push it through,
the administration has ruled this out in a memo-
randum circulated by Dean Halliday on March 17.
 This docume

Social discipline for undergraduates
is administered by the Dean of Stu-
dents and the student may appeal ei-
ther to the Assistant Chancellor for
Student. Affairs or to the University
Review Board,'but never to both. This
Review Board is composed of three
students named by the student govern-
ment, three faculty named" by the
President of the FAS and three admin-
istrators named by the Chancellor.

The point of all this is to illustrate
that disciplinary procedures for the
faculty are vague and arbitrary (imag-
ine if the Dean, who is in charge of
creating the Ad-Hoc committee, feels
particularly predisposed or antagonis-
tic to the person in question): they
simply do not exist for graduate stu-
dents, which means that if a case came
up, the procedures followed would be

at best vaguely defined and arbitrary.

Undergraduates are disciplined ei-

ther by one single administrator or by g

a committee where only one third of
the members are their peers. It seems
to me much more logical that each
group be judged in greater measure by
its peers: that by and large faculty
discipline faculty, graduate students,
graduate students, and undergradu-
ates, undergraduates.

Student participation: Amendments
3, 4, 5 concern this most urgent ques-
tion. “Most urgent” because we are

undergoing a crucial period in the,

change of _faculty-student-administra-
tor relationships. I suggest_.that a
highly effective manner of avoiding
chaos and establishing a meaningful
dialogue is to include as many stu-
dents as possible in decision making
positions. »

I I urge the passage of these amend- -

ments because they would be a major

step toward making the set .of laws"

which is to govern our institution a
juster, more democratic code.

laws, cast doubt on the actions taken at our meet-
ing.” Yet the same argument, if considered valid,
would still hold after paragraph two is accepted by
the April 7 meeting. Acceptance of this ruling
would only create a precedent which could easily
be used by the administration.‘

2. METHOD OF VOTING. »

Initially the bylaws were to be “acted upon at a
meeting to be held on or about March 18” (first
draft). This was also clearly understood when the
second draft of the bylaws was issued on March 17;
persons entitled to vote (by the administration’s
definition) were to register at the desk and receive
lapel stickers. The assumption that the meeting was
to be decisive was made apparent by the very pre-
cautions taken in the matter of credentials." The
same document details the procedure at the meet-
ing, stating that “after the bylaws have been adopt-
ed, elections will be held . . .” Yet, in a memoran-
dum of March 25 Acting Dean Gow modifies the
procedure, introducing a mail ballot for the first

time. V

  
 
  
    
 

The FAS is a relatively small group of men and
women who can easily fit into a single auditorium.
Nevertheless, the administration has now‘ opted '
for an uninformed uninvolved constituency, and in
so doing has stacked the cards against significant
changes in the priorities and practices of the Face-
ulty of Arts and Sciences-

‘ Wednesday, April 2.11969-THE PITT NE-ws-—1§age;

By DAVID SCHUMACHER
Assist. Prof. of Chemistry

Of the four, councils established
in the by-laws of the FAS obviously
the most important is the FAS council
(III; 7). If the by-laws are adopted in
their present form without amend-
ment, this council will act for the FAS
in between meetings of this body. —It
will be able to overrule any of the low-
er councils. It will give advice and con-
sent on selections of deans and it will
appoint all committees whose work
relates to the whole faculty.

If the listed amendments are pass-
ed, the council, in addition, will have
power over discipline; it will be able
to review and make recommenda-
tions on the budget of the FAS, and it
will be able to prevent the dismissal
of a dean. One amendment decreases
the power of the council by removing
its right of consent to appointments of
deans.

Clearly this council will have a great
deal of power with or without the
amendments. For this reason it is es-
sential that nominations for the coun-
cil be as democratic as possible, hope-
fully bringing about representation on
the council of both junior and senior
faculty members.

The by-laws as drafted by the by-
law committee provide for such a pro-
cedure. A nominating committee is
nominated from the floor at the first
FAS_ meeting of the year.-— Additional
nominations may be made by petition.
Of course, for these procedures not to
prejudice the elections no differen-
tiation can be made between those

nominated by the nominating commit-

tee and those nominated by petition.
for people would tend to vote for those
candidates nominated by an official
body rather than by petition.

Unlike the other councils, there is
at present no FAS council in existence.
Consequently, it is.necessary to elect
people to this body. In the covering
letter accompanying the amendments
a procedure for nominating a slate for
this council was established. Most
importantly people elected from this
slate will not serve on an interim ba-
sis until September 1969, but will

- the Faculty with both the nomiriati

mental chairmen to set up a slate of candidatesi-for
the various councils. This was considered unsat _,
factory and modified in the second, final draft (see
paragraph 12). Yet the March 17 memorandum
suddenly reverts to the former procedure: “FASC
nominations will be made at the meeting by the
three committees of department chairmen, a pro‘.
cedure which will not be used again” (italics mine)
Note the uneasiness. Not content with this, the lasj
memorandum of March 25 introduces a mail ballot
for the bylaws and a complete slate for the Couri
cil as set up by the department chairmen. It wa
apparently considered too risky to submit the list :;
of nominees to the scrutiny of an open meeting or;
have this list open to debate. ' 

As pointed out by Dean Halliday: “For the firs
time in the history of our University weare goin
to meet and codify the authority of faculty and ‘stu_ 
dents in conducting the affairs of the FAS. No me_e1t-i "
ing promises to be more important.” f 1"

I am not concerned with those in the Universilt
who either fear consent of the governed or fin
consulting them inefficient and cumbersome. Rath
er, it is to make those members of theacademi
community who find an intrinsic value in depmocra
mic practices aware of the way procedures have bee
, established for the April 7 meeting. It is especiall

important when we are attempting to establish“

The procedure for setting uplgthf’

the democratic safeguards inthe dr

Called Overwhelming

Alternatives to the Draft Expressed

The moral alternatives facing a
young American today with re-
spect to military conscription are
overwhelming. By submitting to
induction, he sacrifices his hu-
manity and his moral principles
in order to fight in support of one
of the most heinous and obscene
wars in the history of mankind.
By scrambling for educational
and occupational deferments, he
feels a loneliness and a very real
sense of guilt in leaving an open-
ing which Selective Service will
fill with someone less fortunate.
By leaving the country, he forfeits

. his citizenship and finds himself

surrendering to forces he can in
no way respect. By taking on the
role of Conscientious Objection
as a moral alternative, he accepts
with despair, the government’s
right to dictate the course of his
own destiny for a long period of
time. By confronting the draft
and refusing induction, he stands
on his moral principles, but sac-
rifices himselt to three-to-five
"years in prison . . . The alterna-
tives, then, are not really alterna-
tives‘ at all. There is no “reward—
ing” choice to be made. But some
choice has to be made. And the na-
ture of that choice, the choice
each of us makes in his own way,
will go a long way toward deter-
mining the course of the remain-
der of our lives . . . For there is
no law anywhere in the world that
is more terrifying from a moral
standpoint than the Selective Ser-
vice law of the United States gov-
ernment.

As an individual, like any other,
faced with this dilemma, I have
fought a long, drawn out battle
within myself. And always, I
have thought of the moral alter-
native of draft resistance. Dur-
ing this time, my conception of the
meaning of resistance has broad-
ened; and my awareness of the
all-pervasiveness of the cancer
that is the war in Vietnam has
broadened as well. At first, I
felt, as many still feel, that draft
resistance was strictly a matter
of breaking a specific law. Think-
ing solely in terms of the war,
without consideration for the na-
ture of the society from which

You Read
— So Slowly?

A noted publisher in Chicago
reports there is a simple tech-
nique of rapid reading, which
should enable you to increase
your reading speed and yet re-
tain much more. Most people
do not realize how much they
could increase their pleasure,
success and income by reading
faster and more accurately.

 

According to this publisher, -

many people, regardless of
their present reading skill, can
use this simple technique to
improve their reading ability
to a remarkable degree. VVhe-
ther reading tsories, books, or
technical matter, it becomes
possible to read sentences at
a glance and entire pages in
seconds with this method.

To acquaint the readers of

this war has grown, I applied
Kant’s rather romantic “categor-
ical imperative” to the situation:
thinking that if everyone were to
refuse induction, there would
be no more wars. But that is not
necessarily so, for as I have come
to realize, simply by looking about
me,‘ by looking into the faces of
emptiness and loneliness I meet
on the street every day, that the
war in Vietnam is not being fought
solely in the rice paddies ten thou-
sand miles away and safely out of
sight, but that it is being fought
here at home as well, within ev-
eryone of us.

For what breeds war in man is
nothing so simple as a draft law;
no more so, than an individual act
of resistance will assure a univer-
sal peace. But rather, war comes
to life within us when we refuse to
resist those forces of greed, or
fear, or mistrust, or ignorance,
or self-pity which then generate
the violent, mindless lashing-
out, the despair of a lack of in-
dividual moral discipline that
realizes itself on a battlefield.
For to believe war to be a man-
ly endeavor is to betray a fear-
fully low opinion of mankind. To
believe that killing can gain hu-
manity a greater sense of its own
worth in its own eyes, is certain-
ly to misunderstand the inherent
beauty of mankind, and of an in-
dividual life. To kill another, -or
to stand aside while others kill
each other, is to kill something
inside oneself. The question then
becomes: Is that death within
ourselves worthy of the price we
have paid for our indecision‘? For
we must all begin to think and
feel in terms of the universality
of mankind, and of the universe of
perception within each of us. For
we are all in this together. We
are all alive together. And we
must think of what that means.

Above my desk in my bedroom,
I have hung a picture, perhaps by

MONDAY NIGHT

More than 150 people turned out Monday night to support several
seniors and graduate students who have made the decision to oppose
the draft and risk arrest by turning in their draft cards. They congre-
gated in the Social Science Building and participated in a ritual-like
ceremony which expressed opposition to the role of the Selective Ser-
vice in “purporting to determine how you will serve your fellow man.”

To those present, opposing the war, but remaining inactive in your
beliefs is the same as supporting the system. The resisters and those in
sympathy further objected to the “deprivation of liberty, the loss of
life” and the hollow and unthinking patriotism that the war in Vietnam
and the inequities of the conscriptive service system entail.

Between the reading of poetry and the chanting of folk songs, mem-
bers of the group sitting on the floor acted out dialogues and read iron-
ical invocations which embodied their objections to the disposition of
tne draft boards in “telling other people how to live their lives” and
their horror to the willing cruelty and inuustice of the war.

Josh Chasen, teaching fellow in History who faces a prison term
shortly, mused that “we know about prisons and sanctuaries. Prisons
come in many forms. Some are classrooms; Some are Common Facili-
ties Buildings.”

John Heyda, one of the group who faces a prison sentence, present-
ed a stack of draft cards to Monsignor Rice to turn in to the Attorney
General. The Monsignor believed that “the system has gone wrong and

given legitimacy to evil; it misuses everything — the churches, the
chaplaincies.”

Two roommates approached him to turn in cards and express their
resentment that the government assumes the right of directing their
lives and forcing them into a commitment to which they are morally
opposed.

Jeff Gamso and Thomas Crawford Hunt Scott declared themselves
“people totally their own and free.-”

Those present broke up to “share bread and wine and discuss the
Open University and talk about Norman Mailer.” '

American citizen owe strict al-
legiance to a government which
has repeatedly broken both con-
stitutional and international law?
Or does he owe it to himself and
his community to act on what he

believes to be morally right in
hopes that others will follow him
in seeking a new respect for the
meaning of law?

Respect for the law is critically
important; without it anarchy
would almost certainly prevail,
an anarchy very similar to that all
around us today. But “respect for
the law” does not mean necessar-
ily that one must obey the stand-
ing law, for it may include such
unjust requirements as the indis-
criminate training of young men
to kill others.

Each man has a responsibility
not only to himself, but to the so-
ciety of which he is a part. But
when that society, and particular-
ly that society’s government ab-
dicates its moral responsibility,
the onus of restoring some sem-
blance of morality falls upon the
shoulders of each individual that
makes up that society. This is an
overwhelming burden, but it is a
burden that must be recognized if
one hopes to restore morality
and life to government.

Draft resistance implies more
than simply a negativistic refus-
al to “serve one’s country.” If
for no other reason than that it
separates the resister from his
society by putting him in prison, it
suggests a commitment to a new
kind of society, — one based not
on a lowest common denominator
of bloodshed and violence, but on
a hope for a society built on
love, feeling, understanding, tol-
erance, creativity and commu-
nity.

it is going to get worse.

Pittsburgh are going up to 30
cents an hour. The rationale be-
hind this is that car-owners, be-
ing the richest element of Pitts-
burgh society, can afford to pay
the revenue needed to support the
cost of increased city “services”
to the taxpayer.

The fact is that commuting col-
lege students, who are perhaps
one of the least affluent strata of
society, are doing so, and at ex-
horbitant rates.

At the insistence of the Com-
muter Association and the Chan-
cellor, some of the meters in Oak-
land will remain at five cents an
hour. Big deal! The fact is that
the students at other schools don’t

are sorely lacking at the Univer-

I propose that a committee be

the feasibility of University park-
ing. This committee, unlike many
other committees formed during
the year, would not offer a few
half—hearted solutions and. satis-

dents and set up liaisons with both
the administration and traffic of-

ed proposals, it would act to make
its proposals reality.

If this committee succeeds, it
would not only serve to correct
one of the banes to the commu-
ters’ existence, but will serve as
an example of’wha't could be

  Drug, Pop-Music Revolution Termed He  

IIIIIIIIIIIIIZIZIZIIIIIZIIIIIIIII111IIIIIIIIIIIIIZIIIII1IIIII;IIIII-I-III-IIIIIi

by JOHN McGUIGAN
Special to the Pitt News

Opinions and revelations about
the drug scene, pop-music, and

. the revolution from a University

student who is an ex-drug user.

After my first “turn-on" with
pot in November of 1967. drugs
and music became an import-
ant part of my life and led me to
a horrible world that remains un-
known to non-drug users and peo-
ple who have just “turned-on"
occasionally.

In high school I became a to-
tal Beatlemaniac. In January of
1967. I came to Pitt, where I
met other Beatlemaniacs. By
the time November came, I was
aware that some of my friends
had- been "turning-on” and that
the Beatles and other groups were
"turning-‘on.” So. out of curiosity.
I decided to "turn-on.” These
people that turned—on seem-
ed to be really "hip" so I thought
I would be “hip."

By the time Winter Term had
ended in 1968. I was turning on
a couple times a week. I wouldn’t
admit it then, but my whole
life was starting to center around
turning-on.

When June came around, I was
on my way to meet widely pub-
licized "Love Pople" in San
Francisco. Here I was leaving the
people who most loved me (my
family and friends) to meet the
"Love People" in San Francis-
co.

By now my curiosity was really
aroused about bigger drugs (like

.LSD) since some of my "turn-

on" friends had been using them.
When I questioned the danger

of LSD about affecting the mind
and chromosones they would
say. “That‘s a lot of crap put out
by society to scare people away
from having fun.

LSD caused confusion

The acid caused a great deal
of confusion of mind and this
was fun for the first few trips.
But as I continued to take acid I
noticed that the confusion be?
gan to linger on longer than the
8 - 10 hour trip. The confusion
results from thinking with the
Primary Processes of the mind
instead "of the usual secondary pro-
cesses. Therefore, small everyday
problems become real hassles,
since the secondary process were
cutoff from deciphering incoming
perceptions into problem solving
actions.

Attempting to solve small
chores was a hassle. but attempt-
ing to solve a big problem, to
make a big decision, was ludic-
rous. The only decision that be-
came easy to make was taking acid
again. I hadn’t had a bad trip.
so chances were that I wouldn’t
have one in the future. Acid was
fun and safe for me; for a while.
But after about five trips, some
dramatic personality changes oc-
curred. I found myself more with-
drawn, having paranoid tenden-
cies and a general lingering con-
fusion about my thinking. The
acid wasn’t the only thingvthat
had been affecting my personality;
loafing with drug users andaddicts
has exposed me to a whole new
drug vocabulary. After learn-
ing this drug vocabulary, I began
to notice this vocabulary in rock
music.

 

Now if you know anything about
addicts, you know that addicts
love only one thing — euphoria.
They love dope so much that they
even personify their drugs. Male
addicts call their drugs "my girl"
“my woman” etc. and female
addicts call their drugs "my
man,” “my guy,” etc. Most
heavy drug users and addicts re-

fer to Euphoria as "love." This

last fact is what was really blow-
ing my mind. I had come to San
Francisco to meet all the people
who were in on the "love“ move-
ment just to find out that "love"
was just a metaphor for "eu-
phoria.” Otherwise a big part of

the "love” movement was a "drug‘

movement. Musiciansl had known
were writing songs personifying
drugs, so I learned a good bit of
their drug vocabulary.

Up until recently. most drug
songs were written in ambiguous
language so that the songs would
be pawned off to “straight peo-
innocent songs about
love. sunshine, rain, going home.
or trains. etc. But to themselves
and other drug users, the mean-
ing was quite obvious. Most pop
music is still this way today. But
nowidrug lyrics. not so ambig-
uous. are emerging from the
drug scene. Velvet Underground

Dave Van Ronk does a song cal-
led “Cocaine,” the Beatles
sing "Happiness is a Warm gun.”
"I need a fix cos I’m going down
etc.” Jim Morrison sings “Come
Back Baby, Back into my arm
(not arms! ).

Horrible Revolution

By this time too, I had become
aware that I was part of nature;
part of this universe. I became
aware that a horrible revolution
is taking place. Man’-s synthetic
world of concrete. steel,. gjass,
.smoke. and chemical wastes is
wiping out life; Man‘s life, wild
life, plant life. Not only is this
revolution taking place. but it
is intentionally taking place. Up to
this time. I had been a sort of
agnostic - Catholic. I went to
Church (when at home) because
I had to and I hand‘t received
the sacraments for about four
years. But along with this iden-
tification with life. which I had
recently acquired, came an aware-
ness of a life energy force. Life
suddenly was really meaningful;
life is not a joke (as Bob Dylan

says) this wondrous universe of

life is controlled by God.

By now I was fed up with the
“Hippy. Trippy. gypsy on my
own“ bit. so I returned to my
family in Pittsburgh. My family
was glad to se_e me back home.
and I was glad to be back home-
but things were different somehow.
First of all. my perception (ex-
pecially vision) had been altered.
Things just didn‘t seem the same
as before my acid experience.
Second; I was more aware of my
persona. or my role playing as
well as other people’s persona. I
had returned home with the in-

e tention of "staying Clean" from

drugs, but I did want to turn on
at least one friend to this identi-
fication with God and life. (that
is. “turning-in” ).

I turned my friend on. and
he invariably came to the same
conclusion as I did. Now since
we could see no danger in this
drug. we figured that if everyone
would "turn-on“ and tune in
on nature. man would see how ugly
his "plastic or synthetic would of
concrete and steel. and smoke
etc. is. and change it. The irony
of this was that to see how ugly
the s_vntheti:c world really is.
we had altered our minds with a
synthetic drug.

By this time. I still wouldn't
admit to myself that I had been
getting hung-up on "turning-
on." I was slowly but surely be-
coming more and more self-cen-
tered. I really believed in God
now. but I thought conventional
religion was a "drag." Eastern
religion is where it is at. What
nonsense! Buddha. Allah. and
God are all the same. Our con-
ventional religion is the best way
our culture has taught us to please

God.

Soon my self-centered way of
drug life withdrew me from par-
ents authority since I held them lar-
gely responsible for our plastic
world. But here I was hung up on
the synthetic feelings of drugs
and putting down the "Establish-
ment" for being hung upon love

Ralph Cindrich Gains All-American Honors
Soph Grappler Places          a
Fourth In NCAA Field     

y MARTHA HARTLE
 Associate Sports Editor -
 Ralph Cindrich sat in the sports office one night about two
-weeks ago; he sat and thought about the Eastern championship
.!.he had‘ just won and the nationalcompetition that lay ahead.
_,“Realistically,” he predicted, “I don’t think I’ll place. Those
9: boys are all too big and strong for me.”

. This past weekend Cindrich met the “big boys” on the mat,

in the quarterfinal bout after de-
feating his first two opponents in
the preliminary rounds. —

Lewis pinned Cindrich in the
second period of the match. after
having taken him down in the
initial period. “I'd say Ralph was
disappointed after the Lewis
match,” Adams explained. "I
wouldn‘t say Ralph could have
beaten him, but he could go a
whole match with him. I was very
impressed with Lewis. The more
I watched him, the more impress-
ed 1 was.“

Lewis had pinned his first op-
ponent in one minute and follow-
ed with a pin in 53 seconds in his
second match. He defeated
Michigan State’s 250 pound Jeff
Smith in the finals 6-1.

After losing to Lewis, Cindrich
moved into the consolation round
where he defeated his first two
opponents before losing in the
consolation finals to third-seeded.
250 pound John Ward of Okla-
homa State. And by the time that
consolation final rolled around,
Cindrich was physically exhaust-
ed.

SOPHOMORE Ralph Cindrich added All-American laurels to his growing list of wrestling honors as a result of
his fourth place finish in the national tournament in Prove, Utah, over the weekend.

"He was just about completely
exhausted,“ Adams explained. “It
was a matter of" his handling so
many guys who were much big-
ger than he was. Each match took
so much out of him. He only had

one hour rest before his match

with Ward. but Ward had only
wrestled one minute the entire
afternoon."

Ward blanked Ralph, 4-0, as he
scored points on a reversal, rid-
ing time and stalling. .“If Ralph

would have been a real good

Stopping the opposition was an-
other problem. For the most part,
Panther hurlers couldn’t keep the

failures resulted from poor field-

"They showed immense im-

surprised at the rather good con-

little work. “

“I think the pitching’s good.
It’s probably our strong point,”
he added.

Cindrich actually finished the
tournament with a 4-2 record. He
defeated his first round opponent
Al Blanshan, a 240 pounder from
Mankato State 13-7, and follow-
ed up with'a 4-0 shut-out over
250 pound Frank Holtry of
U_tah before losing to Lewis. In
the quarterfinal consolation
match, he decisioned Tom Walter
of Kent State, 6-1. Walter weigh-
ed in at 280 pounds, 6’5”.

In the consolation semi-finals.
Ralph defeated fourth seeded Ken
Osbo of Northern Iowa, 11-2. Os-

bo, a 240 pounder, was the na- '

tional college division champion.

“Ralph moved well on his feet,”
Adams related. “He took a lot of
guys down and had a reversal
working well for him too. He
worked on his arm drag and dou-
ble leg tackle for the takedown.
And he rode exceptionally well,
especially against such bigger
boys.”

With the wrestling season now
officially complete, Ralph plans
to take it easy for a few days—and
then it’s up to the stadium for
spring football drills.

Lewis Leads Baseball V
Squad Against W.V.U.

by ED CONLEY

Baseball coach Bobby Lewis was hoping for a home not so
far away from home, but he couldn’t get it.

Lewis wanted his team to open its regular season at Forbes
Field, a ballpark that belongs to the University. But, the deci-

sion was the Pirates’ and they pre-
fer to “break-in” the field them-
selves in their opener next week.

. So, it’s out to the Leech Farm

Field for the opener against West
Virginia. Thursday at 3 p.m.

"It’s an opportunity to cross the
street and see a good game. And.
I think the students will.“ Lewis
said a week ago when he had
some hope of getting the major
league site.

“Some students don’t even know
we have a team,” the coach said.
“After all the team is for the stu-
dents.”

Lewis wanted to play Satur-
day's scheduled 1 p.m. double-

header against Temple at Forbes

Field. too. Those plans. likewise.
must be scrapped.

The coach made some effort
to get the games in onthe All-
Purpose Field behind Trees. Hall.
but a problem with the grass pre-
vented that alternative. In fact.
bad weather during the week
could halt the contests altogether.
There is a drainage problem at
the Leech Farm Field.

Trying to solve the difficulties
of locale has given Lewis the pre-
occupation he needs to keep his
mind off the actual games. After
the disastrous Florida exhibition
circuit, the coach can’t wait to
see his nine against opposition
that play a familiar game.

The Panthers played the Moun-
taineers twice last spring. bat-

 

the ‘game at Morgantown and
dropped the home meeting.

' This year. Lewis sees a chance
for a win at home. The Panthers
have shown him that they‘ll prob-
ably be a low scoring team. so
the Mountaineers are the kind of
team they should do best against.

“They’ve got strong pitching,”
Lewis mentioned, concerning
WVU’s baseball team. “They are
more of a defensive and pitching
team. They don’t score many
runs?’ ‘

The twin-bill with the Owls

could be a long afternoon for the

mitters. Last year‘s Owl team
went to the NCAA District II
play-offs. Before coach Jim Wil-
son‘s nine bowed out of the cham-
pionships they had compiled a
20-5 mark.

"They are offense.“ Lewis said.
"They score a lot. Last year they
had five hitters over .300."

V One thing that has got to be to
the mitters’ advantage is the loss
of personnel the Owls suffered
overthe off-season. Five of last
spring’s starters, including the
second best hitter in the nation,
Les Roos, and the top hurlers,
Hal Werntz and John Gardner,
graduated last year. .

DePasqua Teaches Panthers Poise
As Enthusiastic Defensemen React

by JERRY GRUEBEL
Sports Editor
After the scrimmage at Monday’s spring football practice
session, the whistle blew and the gridders gathered around

coach Carl DePasqua.

“You can have all the enthusiasm in the world, but that’s

not going to get you anywhere,’
“Poise is what I am looking for.’

DePasqua was referring to one
particular play mintues earlier
when a defensive linemen charged
from his position and hit his man

. before the ball was snapped.

COACH CARL DePASQUA
Teaches Poise

’ said DePasqua in the huddle.

Within seconds, the entire de-
fensive unit was making contact.
“One or two is enough,” said De-
Pasqua, explaining why he sent
in a new offensive unit and a new
defensive eleven while he had the
22 players involved in the play
run one lap around Pitt Stadium’s
field, “but they all reacted. The
entire defensive unit lost their
heads.”

Last year’s football team began
the season with all the spirit and
enthusiasm of a championship

If squad, but game after game they

were penalized considerably for

sloppy mistakes.

“In a game,” said DePasqua,
“that could have cost us 15-yards.

 _ This is what we have to work at.”

DePasqua’s method is combat.
He plans to run the remainder of
the drills similar to Monday’s
practice which included contact
between the offensive and defen-
sive lines early in the session and
-a full-squad scrimmage late in the

drill period. The only changes
will probably be more combat as
the spring “session” progresses.

DePasqua has expressed a spe-
cial invitation to the students of
the University for tomorrow’s
practice. A longer scrimmage,

starting at about 5 p.m. is plan-

ned.

“No one has been outstanding
yet,” explained DePasqua after
Monday’s drills. “But they have-
n’t had the opportunity.”

, Spring football practice will
run through April 26 when the
annual Blue-Gold game will end
the first organized preparations
for next season’s grid campaign.

“It’s all routine now,” admit-
ted DePasqua, unable to point a
finger at any significant individ-
ual achievement.

But by the time the annual
Blue-Gold game takes place, De-
Pasqua will most likely have a
clearer picture of his personnel
and what to expect for next sea-
son. '

DePasqua is also busy with re-

‘ cruiting in the Western Pennsly—

Vania area. Thus far, DePasqua
has announced the signing of sev-
en grant—in-aide footballers.

Kentucky Relays Pose First Test  
For Thinclads In Outdoor Season

by BOB LEDERMAN

When Jim Banner’s tracksters
head for the Kentucky Relays to-
morrow, they’ll be hoping to en-

. counter warmer temperatures than

those they’ll be leaving behind.
The thinclads have been working
out in the stadium for two weeks
now, however, unseasonably cold
weather has been playing havoc
with practice sessions.

“We haven’t been able to do
any speed work,” lamented Ban-
ner.

“The first week we were out
was just to get the feel of the out-
door track after having run in-
doors all winter,” noted assistant
coach Gary Meckley. “It seem-
ed that you just couldn’t dress
warm enough.”

With a large number of South-
ern schools entered in the relays,
the local‘ weather problem may
take its toll. Schools like Georgia
Tech, Alabama, and Tennessee
have had an opportunity to work
outdoors more than the thinclads.

Jim Banner, however, is look-
ing forward to the relays. “I think
it’ll'be a good meet to start out-
doors with. There’s no team score;
I like that. It‘ll give me a good"
opportunity to move people
around a bit.”

Bryant Salter, currently nur-
sing a bad ankle, is slated to go in
the high jump, broad jump, and
triple jump. Jeff Snyder will go
for the tracksters in the pole vault
competition, while Greg Ellis will
handle both the discus and shot
put details. Dan Kuovolo will be
the thinclad entrant in the jave-
lin toss.

Any track fans who enjoy long

distance races, won't be disap-

pointed by the slate of running
events which include the distance
medley, the two-mile relay and
a— six mile race. The distance med-
ley team features John Aiken
(880), Smitty Brown (440), Greg
Rodgers (3“4 mile) and Jerry Rich-
ey (mile). The two mile relay,
one of the thinclads stronger
events, will be capablyhandled by

Rudy Hufnagle, _ Fred . Rodgers, .

 

John Aiken and Jerry Richey. The
six-mile race will see freshman
runner Ken Balkey competing
along with Mike Nolan and Mark
Vornhagen.

In the shorter races, Dave Gar-
nett will be the thinclad entrant in
the 100-yard dash. Carlos Rei-
sen will be competing in the In-

‘ termediate hurdles, while Dave

Brinn will compete in the high
hurdles.

Although the tracksters lack
depth, they have many strong
areas and should make a respec-
table account of themselves in
this, the first outing of the out-
door season.

JEFF SNYDER, one of Jim Banner’s consistent top performers, was
one reason for the tracksters success during the past winter. Jeff is the
thinc|ad’s lone entrant in the pole vault competition in Kentucky on

Friday.

Wednesday, April  i969-—"i‘HE:
Nationals Mark Completion-
Of ‘Disappointing’ Season;
M atmen Look to Next Year.

Ralph Cindrich’s fourth place finish in the nationals ove“
the weekend brought a bright close to the wrestling season, a
season which coach Dave Adams described overall as “disa_pﬂ

pointing.”
The grapplers finished the

‘dual meet seasonwith a 3-6-1

mark, but two of the losses were
heartbreaking one point decisions
to Maryland and Army. “We
didn’t do as well as we hoped
we would,” Adams reflected.
“But it wasn’t the boys’ fault.”

Adams pointed to numerous in-
juries which plagued the team
throughout the season, beginning
with the loss of last year’s 123-
pound Eastern runner-up Bruce
Unangst before the first match.
He pointed out that there wasn’t
one boy who wasn’t bothered with
an injury of some sort during the
season. “I don’t want to make any
excuses though,” he continued.
“We just didn’t do as well as we
had expected.”

Cindrich and Bob Kuhn were
the only place winners for the
grapplers in the Easterns, —.but
again the team was hit with the
injury bug when sophomore Mark 
Payne suffered a kidney ailment
the night before the tournament.
The illness also prevented. Payne
from entering the nationals. ' J"

Looking ahead to next year,
however, the grapplers lose only
one senior through graduation
and with the initiation of the fresh’-;
man eligibility rule, the squad: will
be bolstered by both sophomores
and freshmen next year. A a

“Right now there’s not much

ter next year,” quipped -Aams,

the number two spot, lost both
his singles matches. Despite his
,6-3 ‘defeats, Stromp said that the
.man who beat Thompson, Marc
Parson, is almost as good as Fred
Smith. “Parson played last year
and was excellent. I tied him last
year after the match was called
‘because of darkness,” he said.

‘ _ As'for the other singles match-
es. WVU‘s freshman Bob Nilsen
romped over Emil Spadifiore. 6-0

Mike Dzadousky. 6-1 in both

The golf team started‘ its season yesterday afternoon with a
loss to West Virginia University. The Mountaineers, playing
on their home course at Lakeview Country Club, whipped the

linksmen. 1512 to 812.

The match was played under a
three points per twosome match
pla_v setup. In each of the eight
twosomes. a point was awarded
to the man who was ahead after
the front nine holes. a point to the
man ahead after the back nine.
and a point to the man with the
best total strokes.

In match play. a player can win
a hole by any number of strokes.
but he still goes just one up for
that round.

The linksmen managed to be
ahead in only five of the 16
rounds played, and they tied one"
other round.

Although the squad lost by a
substantial margin. coach Rex

Peer_v was pleased with his play-

‘ er's performances. "Lakeview is

considered a very difficult course
and because of the light rain dur-
ing the day. I would have to say
that both teams played well un-
der the circumstances.“ he com-
mented.

"I was pleasantly surprised by
the team." he continued. "I

thought they came through pret-'

ty good and a lot better than I
had expected."

first nine. and played even on the
back nine. Henry Higgenbottom.

Kappa Sig, Delts Win Frat TrackMeet

By BOB LEDERMAN

Delta Tau Delta, tired of being number two in the race for
the “A” league A1l—Sports Trophy, “tried a little bit harder”
last Thursday night and walked away number one. The Delts not
only won their division in the fraternity wrestling league, but they also
won the highly sought after All-Sports Trophy.

The‘Delts took first place in the
mile. broad jump, and 440 relay.
They also set a new fraternity
league record in winning the mile
medley (3:57). In compiling 99
points in wrestling competition,
the Delts raised their overall
point total to 7331/2.

Sigma Chi finished a strong
second in the two day meet as
they went on_ to capture a first
place finish in the 50-yard hur-
dles (6.6) and the high jump
(5’8”). The Sig Chi’s also took
second place spots in the mile
medley, 440 relay and shot put
competitions. Overall, the Sig
Chi’s accumulated 79 points in
the 16-team meet.

checking in with a 53'/2 point to-
tal. The Phi Kaps placed in all
events except the shot put, tak-
ing third in the 50 yard hurdles,
second in the high jump and fourth
in the mile medley.

In the number four spot, Delta
Sigma Phi accumulated 50 points.
Denny Ferris was the Delta Sig’s
key runner as he captured a first
place in the 50 yard dash, and an-
other first place in the 220 dash.
In taking top honors in the 220,
Ferris set a new fraternity rec-
ord with an extremely fast 23.8.

Pi Lambda Phi registered a
fifth place finish in the two-day

meet. The Pi Lams collected 361/2
points by taking a second place
in the broad ‘jump and 220
events, and a third place in the
50 yard dash.

place finish as they went on to
tally 26 points in the track and
field competition. ZBT placed third
in the mile medley with a time of
4.17.

Sigma Alpha ‘ Mu registered
22 points, as they struggled to
a seventhplace berth. ‘Jeff Tuck-
felt registered the Sammies only
placement points by taking a fifth
place spot in both the shot put and
the 220 dash. '

In what surprised a good num-
ber of people, Phi Epsilon Pi col-
lected a meager 20 points. Phi
Ep failed to place in any event and
consequently fell out ofthe run-
ning for A1l—Sports Trophy, a tro- A
phy they had won last year.
