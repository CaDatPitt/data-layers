Panthers sweep Backyard rawl

Alex Oltmanns

Sports Editor

It took the Pitt men’s basketball team three

overtimes to defeat rival West Virginia last

year at the Petersen Events Center.
This time around, the Panthers made sure
that the game didn’t go past regulation.

Behind strong games from Gilbert Brown‘ '

and Nasir Robinson and impressive per-
formances from bench players like Lamar
Patterson, No. 4 Pitt blew past the Moun-
taineers 71—58. . g

West Virginia (17-10, 8-7 Big East) went

into halftime with a 31-30 lead in a tightly

officiated game that landed Robinson and
Brown into foul trouble with two and three
fouls, respectively. 9 7 .

But the Panthers (25—3, 13-2 Big East)
used a 7-0 run, that included ﬁve points
from Patterson, to start the second half and
reclaim the lead — a lead they would never
give back. i i

“We just adjusted at halftime,” Pitt senior
Brad Wanamaker said in a post—game news
conference. “We were letting them play a
little too physical with us and we weren’t
responding. -In the second half, we settled
down and adjusted to their defense.”

Pitt guards Ashton Gibbs and Wanamaker
shot a combined 1-for-9 from the ﬁeld in the
ﬁrst half, including 0-for-6 from 3-"point
range. A V

But Brown made up for it by going 4-for-5
from the ﬁeld and making each of his three
3-pointers in the ﬁrst half. ‘

“I felt that we had a valiant effort in the
ﬁrst half and we just really weren’t mak-
ing shots,” Brown said in the news confer-
ence. “Tonight I had my shot going and it
deﬁnitely gave me an opening to get to the
basket.”

But Gibbs and Wanamaker wouldn’t stay
quiet for long. Both guards heated up in the
second half.  

Wanamaker ﬁnished with 11 points, while
Gibbs pitched -in with nine.

Obama’s stance on Marriage Act ‘medium to small’ Victory

Keith Gillogly
Senior Staff Writer

When the Obama administration announced
Wednesday that it would not enforce a law
limiting marriage rights to a man and a
woman, the decision elicited strong feel-
ings from students both for and against gay
marriage._

The Defense of Marriage Act limits fed-
eral recognition of marriage to only the legal
union between a man and a woman, and
therefore limits same—sex couples’ federal
marriage beneﬁts. Although many mem-
bers of the LGBTQ community hail Obama’s
announcement as a signiﬁcant victory, for
some college students, the decision’s imme-
diate impact seems less momentous. Other
students disagree; they don’t see the deci-
sion as a-victory. A

James Weaver, president of Pitt’s Rain-
bow Alliance, said he saw the announcement
as “medium to small” victory for the LGBTQ

community, although it has the potential to
become more signiﬁcant.
’ “It’s maybe 20 or 30 years down the road

or longer, but eventually .I think it’s going .

to be like the race issues in the ’6os where
people will look back on it and go, ‘That
was stupid. Why did we ever ban that?”’

" he said. '

After examination, the presidentsaid
that Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage
Act, when applied to same—sex couples le-
gally married under state law, violates equal
protection rights. The controversial section
deﬁnes “marriage” as only a union between
a man and a woman. , V

The Obama administration also said it
will not defend the law in relation to two
lawsuits raised in federal courts by ‘same-sex
couples from New York and Connecticut.

Tricia Dougherty, Political Action Chair '

of Rainbow Alliance, said the decision is
monumental for the LGBTQ community,
but has less impact on the average Pitt stu-
dent. A

“Usually before things with marriage
happen; things happen with non-discrimi-
nation laws and stuff like that because those
are a little_bit less controversial. So I think
that for the president to go ahead and even
be talking about marriage, it’s a big step
forward,” Dougherty said.

Dougherty said marriage is _far enough
away. for most college students that the de-
cision doesn’t practically’ apply. A1s.o,’most
college students are part of a younger demo-
graphic that is often considered apathetic
toward many political issues, and even the
politically savvy might not be invested in an
issue like marriage, she said.

“We’re in that age group where marriage
doesn’t really apply to anyone,” she said.

' Though same—sex marriage is an issue 5
that Rainbow Alliance addresses, it’s not
at the forefront of issues the group hopes ,

to take up.

“We address it, but as far as us being an I.

activist group, we try to focus more on stuff
we can change on campus because there’s a

lot of policies and stuff that can be improved
at Pitt and we have a lot more power over
that,” ‘Weaver said. .

Weaver said that while he doesn’t believe
that students on campus will be greatly af-
fected by this development, it’s still a step
forward for the LGBTQ community. Although
the community has had other recent victo-
ries, such as the planned_repeal of “Don’t Ask
Don’t Tell,” legal advancements alone won’t
change discriminatory opinion.

“People’s opinions aren’t going to change
because laws change. It takes them being
educated, which is a big part of what Rain-
bow tries to do,” Weaver‘ said.

Although Obama has previously said he’s
opposed to the Defense of Marriage Act,
his announcement yesterday solidiﬁed this
stance. ' ‘

“For a long time, President Obama has
been supporting the LGBTQ community with
word but not with as much action as people
would have liked,” Dougherty said.

Some question
executive’ authority

Marriage < 2

Although some students welcome the
administration’s stance, the executive deci-
sion raised concerns for others.

Matthew Vermeire, a junior and the cur-
rent president of Pitt College Republicans,
said the stance sets a “dangerous standard
in terms of executive power expansion.”

“Using [the presidential veto] retroac-
tively for past legislation and presidents
threatens the checks and balances of our
democratic republic,” he wrote in an e-
mail. -

Jarrod Interval, a Pitt freshman, said he
isn’t a supporter of same—sex marriage and
believes the issue is of little substance.

“I think it gets blown up "a little too much,”
he said. “There are things of greater concern

to [the government] .”

Vermeire agreed.

“Although social issues remain important
to many Republicans, a large general con-
sensus remains that, given unemployment
and slow ﬁscal deﬁcits, getting our economy
back on track and balancing the budget are
priorities,” he wrote.

Eric Dykstra, a Pitt senior, said that ‘he
doesn’t regularly follow current political
events, but because college has given him a
chance to become friends with members of
the LGBTQ community, the announcement
was good news to him. .

“I’ve gotten to know a lot of people tha

are gay or lesbian [in college], and I’m all -

for their rights,” he said. I

The suspect in the Parkvale Bank robbery,
described as a 60-year-old white male with
gray hair and a gray sweatshirt, went up to
the window and handed the teller a note
demanding money, police said. The teller
then handed over an undisclosed amount of
money, which police said the suspect folded
in the note before exiting the bank.

Another witness told police that he saw
the suspect enter a maroon Jeep and drive
down Semple Street to leave the area. Police
said that they identiﬁed Doyle from surveil-

with aggravated assault over

On Wednesday, the U.S. De-

Mike Good’s Feb. 21 piece, “Pitt a

points out that Pitt is underper—
forming in sustainability efforts;
Despite leading the Big East on the

place in sustainability. Whﬂe Good
proposes that the Pitt community
needs a ground-up effort to boost

believe that Pitt’s administration
should take’ the lead in progressing
towards a more sustainable future
for our University. A

Chancellor Nordenberg himself

Beyond vastly reducing Pitt’s en'-

ACUPCC would give the Pit com-
munity even more to be proud of. By
demonstrating a publicly account-
able dedication to sustainability, ‘Pitt

Pitt can’t afford not to make.

RADICALS FOR MODERATES

Crucial time to reappraisepublic option

With Obama’s health care act in congressional flux, it’s time to reconsider federally provided health insurance

Brendan Sullivan
Columnist

Remember the public option?
I do.

As Middle Eastern dictator-
ships flounder amid popular
revolutions and Wisconsin
unions scramble for their col-
lective bargaining rights, the
American health care debate
probably seems incredibly
unimportant. But as the new
health care law continues to

i‘ receive legislative and judicial

attention, now is no time for
complacency.

Since it passed inlthe U.S.
House of Representatives,
the bill to repeal President
Barack Obama’s 2010 Afford-
able Care Act will likely die in
the Democrat-controlled Sen-
ate. But hope remains for the
repeal—hungry Tea Party. Not
too long ago another federal
judge struck down the law, say-

ing it was invalidated by the 0

“individual mandate,” a pro-
vision that requires almost all
Americans 'to purchase health
insurance. _

I was ashamed to hear the
White House refer to the ruling
asjudicial activism — I seethed
when George W. Bush used to
reference activist judges, and
I don’t approve of this admin-
istration rehashing Bush-era
buzzwords. “And unlike the
White House and many Demo-
crats, I won’t be upset if the
mandate is finally invalidated.
The idea that the government
can force me to buy insurance
from a private corporation rubs

me the wrong way. But regard-
less, we cannot allow the in-
tended consumer protections
of the mandate to be stripped
away. -
Weighing consumer safety,

‘individual liberties and the

necessity of high health care
standards in this country, my
mind wandered back to the
early days of the health care

method. The public option, on
the other hand, achieves the
desired result, i.e. of affordable
health care for all, without im-
pinging on any one’s individual
rights and liberties.

When we talk about lowering

costs and improving access, the.

principle behind these data is
that of the social safety net.
Beginning with Social Security

ment that the public option is a

government takeover of health

care. I mean, the word “option”
is right in the title. And that’s
why the public option is supe-
rior to the mandate ——- choice
instead of requirement. The
government is just entering
the market as a competitor
to private insurance compa-
nies. But that’s another thing

The public option would   
establish a minimum level
of health care for the entire

debate, when liberals still.held
hope for a public option. Now
that the law could make its
way to the Supreme Court -

to potentially have the man— ‘

date struck down ~— now is the
time to reappraise that public
option. —

The mandate was enacted to
spread the costs of treating the
sick over the entire population.
But why buy health insurance
when you’re healthy? A diffu-
sion of costs is a good way to
‘bring down prices,_but I do not
believe that requiring everyone
to purchase some form of health
insurance is the appropriate

population.

in the 1930s, the government
established a minimum amount
of retirement savings for work-
ers. Lyndonjohnson expanded
the safety net with Medicare
and Medicaid, establishing a
minimum level of health care
for the elderly and the poor.
The public option would con-
tinue this trend by establish-
ing a minimum level of health
care for the entire population.
Ifyou cannot afford private in-
surance, you will be able to rely
on the government to provide

the type of.no—frills coverage

you need.
I never understood the argu-

thatenrages people-about the

policy.
Those who disagree with the

public option say that it will _

artificially lower costs, mak-
ing the business of health care
unprofitable and eventually
leading to the collapse of the
industry, and probably West-
ern Civilization as we know it.

This is nonsense. According '

to the Henry J. Kaiser Family
Foundation, over the period of

1999-2008, health care premi-

ums rose by 119 percent. This
is 85 percentage points higher
than the cumulative inflation

‘ rate, meaning that the cost of

health care is growing substan-
tially faster than that of other
services. Oh, and health insur-
ance provider Aetna reported
earnings of $1.8 billion in 2010.
CIGNA, another health insur-
ance firm, made $1.3 billion in

2009. These are not companies

that are hurting.

Incredibly, many people vo-
ciferously decried the public
option because would interfere
with the health care market.
As if the American government
doesr_i’t interfere with markets
on a daily basis. Just to pick
on someone, look at Mitch
McConnell, the Senate minor-
ity' leader who also wants to
repeal the health care act. He
voted in.2007 not to remove
government subsidies for oil
corporations. Tax breaks allow
oil companies to pay an average
of 9 percent on capital invest-
ments, as opposed to 25 -per-
cent for businesses in general.
That, my friends, is interfering
with a market.

However, those who made
these straw-man arguments
against the public option were
the loudest during the health
care debate, and we compro-
mised on the individual man-
date. Now that the mandate
might be struck down, it is
time to revive the debate on
the public option, but hold fast
to dialogue and not allow it to
be hijacked by fearmongers
once again. We must speak ra-
tionally about the policy. It’s
about helping people.

ing in work boots was a show of
solidarity against the brutality of
their bosses, as well as a way to
unwind during free time.

Slaves brought this dance,
called the gumboot, with them
when they were sent to Ameri-
ca, where it remained a means
of demonstrating against their
masters, Epitropoulos said. Af-
ter the Civil War, stepping faded

away until newly-formed black a

fraternities and sororities revived

"the practice in the 1900s. These’
groups combined the stomping
of the gumboot dance with tradi— -

" tional African singing and danc-
ing to create modern stepping.
V Originally used as a means
‘to impress and recruit pledges,
l stepping grew into a casual com-
petition between organizations.
After the rise of hip-hop break-
, dancing, Epitropoulos said, step-
, ping became much more competi-
tive, and is now even featured on
T shows like “Ameri_ca7s Best Dance
5 Crew.”. C  
As the form has evolved com-

petitively, it hasfalso matured
artistically. Epitropoulos noted

thatstepping is now a “hard and
clean competition through artis-
tic expression.” He ﬁnds that ev-
ery step routine needs to have an
underlying message of “solidarity,
cooperation, support and love just
to get off the ground. However,

the themes can range from pain,

love, sorrow, joy —- all of what life
holds and what art expresses.”
The routines showcased at the
Steel City Step Show transcend
the traditional rhythms of step-

. ping, incorporating props, imag-

ery and complex themes. Several
groups have styles they are par-
ticularly known for —— Omega Psi
Phi, for instance, is famous for
using small hops. ,.

Every year offers a chance for
each organization to reinvent it-
self. Each fraternity and sorority
choreographs their routine as a
group, with individual members
devising their own sections of
the performance. Certain people
might even play characters in
small skits between steps, allow-
ing a humorous or melodramatic

anecdote to be told and giving the T

steppers a much needed rest.

Many routines incorporate the
precision and power of military
drills. These run the gamut from
dressing up in fatigues and shout-
ing cadence to lining up at atten-
tion before launching into Afri-
can dances. This approach was
popularized by African-American

_ World War II veterans who used

stepping as a way to bond with
other soldiers in their segregated

‘ units.

The show draws increasing
numbers of people from the Uni-
versity and beyond. Oriola said
he was particularly happy that
“not only arepeople becoming
aware of it, but they are also ask-
ing questions,” turning the show
into a forum.

In addition to a dance compe-
tition which celebrates history
and culture, the Steel City Step

‘Show aims to be an opportunity

for leadership and service.
Turlington’s sorority, for ex-
ample, visited the Wilkinsburg
Boys & Girls Club and “talked to
them about stepping and showed
them a couple routines.” Last
year, the organization gave away
tickets to the show in exchange

, for donated goods for Haiti. I

Adele reaches musical
maturity with ‘21’  

British songwriter agesgracefully on new album

Natalie Bell ,.

A&E Editor

21

Adele

XL Recordings/ Columbia

Rocks like: Duffy, Kate Nash

B+ _ ‘

21, Adele’s follow—up to her debut release
19, showcases some welcome changes, in
the singer—songwriter: She’s sultry, sassy
and just a bit wiser. In 19, she asked her
first lover for forgiveness; on this CD,
she’s crooning to a few more ex-lovers
with the maturity of experience on her
side.

The album demonstrates musical as
well as personal growth, utilizing more
instruments and conveying a more pol-
ished sound. 7

The songstress’ soulful pipes, remi-
niscent of a bygone era, push powerfully
through songs like “Turning Tables.”
Over pianos and strings, she bids adieu
to a lover saying, “I won’t let you close
enough to hurt me / No, I won’t ask you,
you to just desert me.” The power of her

voice over the long, expressive string '

notes and repetitive piano makes for an
affecting ballad.

Conversely, her cover of The Cure’s
“Lovesong” is slow and sensual. The
acoustic guitars pluck dreamily as she

' sings, “Whenever I’m alone with you /

You make me feel like I am whole again/
Whenever I’m alone with you / You make
me feel like I am young again.” It seems
appropriate for the diva to sing such a
bittersweet tune —— despite being only
22, her voice and style convey a sort of
love—jilted, old—soul persona.

In a time when pop ‘stars often. come
packaged and electronically altered, it’s
refreshing to know someone like‘Adele is
still ‘capable of conveying uncompromis-
ing force and emotion. I

A long-awaited day will arrive for the
Pittbaseballteamthisweekend, when
itwill be the ﬁrstteam to play a home
game atthe new Petersen Sports Com-
plex behind'I‘rees Hall.

The baseball team will be a part of
the grand opening as it plays against
Indiana University-Purdue University
Fort Wayne, while the softball and
men’s and women’s soccer teams will

The baseball home opener, which

“was scheduled to take place on Friday
at 1 p.m., has been moved to Saturday
dueto expectedinclementweather. The
Pantherswilltakeon lPFWinadoubleL

Pittheadbaseball coachjoejordano
said he’s excited about the addition to
campus.

“The new complex is great,”Jor-
dano said. “We had a chance to get
out afew times lastweek and it played
well. We look forward to playing this

‘ weeken ”

V” Forthebaseballteam,the newcom-
plex not only offers a state-of-the—art
home, but has proved to be a valuable
recruiting tool as well.

‘flthadhelpedus alreadywhile itwas
being built,”Jordano said “We signed
arguablythe mosthighly regardedclass
inrecenthistory. I don’tbelievewithout
the new facility we could have accom-
plished that.”

The recruiting success can only
improve as potential players watch

1;’ the Panthers compete in the new

’ complex.

“The new facility was way over-
due and was needed for many years,”
Jordano said. “I am very pleased I am

«here tobeapartofit.Ibelievetheguys -

feelvery much athome at-the Petersen
‘3vSportsComp1ex.Iamconﬁdentwewill
settle in quickly.”

The Panthers’ former ﬁeld was
Trees Field, which was widely viewed
astheworstfacilityintheBigEast. Pitt’s
newﬁeldputs the Panthers nearthe top

,. ;9f the league for facilities.

The baseball ﬁeld is all synthetic,
including the inﬁeld. This will allow
the Panthers to play and practice year-
round and spend much less time prac-
ticing inside the Cost Sports Center.

Soltballwill have the sameoutﬁeld

“as the baseball ﬁeld, but the softball

The soccer pitch is also synthetic,

urns that house Major League Soccer
teams.

Duraspine meets FIFA require-
ments and allows for the most natu-
ral performance. It has also proven to
be extremely durable in tests, which
will prove valuable due to Pittsburgh’s
weather and the amount of use the ﬁeld
will receive.

Pitt soccer player Ryan Brode said
the complex is a huge upgrade for the
pro

“We’re headed in the right direc-
tion,” he said.

Most importantly, the soccerteams
will now play in Oakland for the ﬁrst
time since the demolition ofPitt Stadi-
um. The soccerteams havebeenplaying
atFounders Field, 20 minutes north of
the city in Cheswicl<. The new, conve-
nient location shouldmake iteasier for
Pitt suidentsto attend games. V

‘°We’-re looking forward to having
a lot of st11dent support there,” Brode
said. “Our ﬁrst spring game is March
20 and we’re excited to play.”

forthe teams, as individual lightingwill
be installed on each of the ﬁelds. Each
ﬁeld features a press box and both the
baseball and softball ﬁelds contain
dugouts. '

‘ John M. and Gertrude E..Petersen, «

who offered alarge gifcto the University"

sible. Their gift allowed Pitt ofﬁcials I

to sign off on the ﬁnal construction

BIG EAST BREAKDCWN f

As the end of the regular season

nears, the Big East looks to be in .

a better and better position to
send 11 teams to the NCAA Tour-
nament. Eleven. Eleven out of 16
teams. Youjust can’t beat that.
Right now, eight teams — Pitts-
burgh, Notre Dame, Louisville,
St.«John’s, Syracuse, Georgetown,
Villanova and Connecticut —
look like they have spots locked
up and West Virginia is all but
there. The two teams that remain
on the bubble, albeit barely —
Cincinnati and Marquette — can

action. The conference’s top two
teams, Pitt and Notre Dame, were
upset by St. John’s and West Vir-
ginia, respectively. However, due
to the ever-raging battle to climb
the standings ladder, they remain
at the top. Notre Dame barely es-
caped another loss, this one to
Providence by a 93-92 score. ‘In
that game, the Friars’ Marshon
Brooks scored a Big East-record

52 points, including 35 in the’

second half. Brooks’ 52 points
tied for the most points scored
this season nationally and was
the third most scored in a loss
in the last 15. seasons. Brooks
shot 20-28 from the floor (71.4

_ percent) and 6-10 (60 percent)‘

from beyond the arc in his epic
performance. 
Elsewhere, Cincinnati :.up-
set No..,11 Georgetown, butizthe
Hoyas lost more than justithe

game. Forward and second-lead-

” ing scorer Chris ‘Wright broke his

left hand and is out indeﬁnitely.

.— . ......~,.. ..-...'..~... 4

He already underwent surgery,

_ and the Hoyas are optimistic that

he will return to play by NCAA
Tournament time — but that’s
anything but certain.,The win
over a top-15 team helps Cincin-
nati’s tournament bid tremen-

‘dously.

Games this week include Syra-
cuse at Georgetown and St.]ohn’s
at Villanova on Saturday, Pitt at
Louisville and Connecticut at
Cincinnati on Sunday, Villanova
at Notre Dame on Monday. and
Pitt at South Florida and UConn
at WVU on Wednesday.

Power Rankings

1. Pittsburgh — St.]ohn’s ru-
ined the return of Ashton Gibbs,
stealing the game from Pitt in
the ﬁnal seconds for a one—point
victory. Gibbs poured in a career-
high 26 points and was 6-9 from
3-point range. The Panthers still
sit alone at the top of the confer-

Villanova
dropping off

ence standings.

2. Notre Dame —— The Irish missed
their chance to make up ground on Pitt in
the standings when they were trounced
by West Virginia, 72-58. The loss snapped
the Irish’s seven-game win streak, a streak

that I inaccurately predicted would run

the rest of the regular season and reach
12 games. '

3. St.]ohn’s —— The Red Storm is mak-
ing huge strides in my power rankings
thanks to some great play against tough
teams. Dwight Hardy’s reverse layupwith
1.2 seconds left stunned top-5 Pitt and

_ moved St. ~]ohn’s into the Top 25. After

murdering DePaul, the Red Storm took a
ﬁve-game win streak into their last three
games against Villanova, Seton Hall and
USF. A

 4. Louisville —— The Cards have played

_ well over their past two games, destroy-

ing UConn and then holding Rutgers to

37_.points. They held UConn star Kemba P

Walker "to only 16 points and will host
Pitt on Sunday in a big conference show-
down.

5. Syracuse — The Orange avenged
their earlier loss to Villanova with an
entertaining 69-64 road victory. Wild-
cat‘Corey Stokes returned after missing

, several games with turf toe and was 5-10

from 3-point range, netting 24 points.
’Cuse has only two games remaining, but
faces a stiff test against Georgetown to-
morrow night. . ’

6. Georgetown —- The Hoyas look
like they are in trouble without Wright,
but they already havea NCAA bid locked
up, so the immediate future is not as big
of a deal. Wright did break his non—shoot-
ing hand after all, and if he can-return,
Georgetown will look primed for a deep
tourney run.

7. Connecticut — The over-reliance
on Kemba Walker was evident in UConn’s
loss to Louisville. The Huskies have played
solidly all year, but just haven’t been able
to develop a supporting cast. Now the
NCAA has suspended coach Jim Calhoun
for three games next season for recruiting
violations. Not a good time for distrac-
tions, Coach.

8. Villanova - Over the past five

_ games, Villanova is 2-3 with only close

victories over Seton Hall and DePaul.The
Wildcats are a dangerous team, but they
haven’t beaten a ranked team since Syra-
cuse over a month ago — and the Orange
just returned the favor. They close out the
season with a tough stretch featuring St.
John’s, Notre Dame and Pitt. This isvnot
a good point in the season to forget how
to beat good teams.

Patterson scores career-high 11 points

‘M_‘en’s basketball 4 1

Meanwhile, with several of his team-

mates in foul trouble, Patterson provided
the spark off the bench that Pitt needed.

“In practice I’ve been playing pretty well,
so it feltgood to go out on the court and put
something together,” Patterson said in the
news conference. “Watching the leaders on
the court ahead of me, it made the process
real smooth.”

His performance was even more im-
portant given the fact that forward Talib
Zanna missed the game with a broken right

thumb. Zanna is expected _to miss three to
six weeks.

“We found out this afternoon,” Pitt head
coach Jamie Dixon said in last night’s post-

, game news conference.’ “He’s going to have
surgery tomorrow, so that’s when we’ll know
[a timetable for his return] .”

Scoring a career-high 11 points, Patter-
son contributed solid minutes and ended the
game with an emphatic slam dunk.

The win marks the second time Pitt has
beaten West Virginia this season, after its
71-66 victory in Morgantown, W.Va., on

Feb. 7.‘ 1‘

The Panthers struggled during that game,
missing Gibbs with an MCL injury, but on
Thursday night, the Mountaineers proved
to be no match for Pitt in front of its raucous
home crowd.

One of the lone bright spots for th};
Mountaineers in the loss was Casey Mitch-
ell, who poured in 22 points.

The Panthers return to action Sunday at
2 p.m. at No. 16 Louisville at the KFC Yum!
Center. I
