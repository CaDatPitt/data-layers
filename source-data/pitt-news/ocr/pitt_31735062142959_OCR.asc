Woltman Gets
Pulitzer Prize

Pitt alumnus Frederick Wolt-
man, staff writer and investigator
for the ‘New York World Tele-
gram, this week, received the
Pulitzer prize“ for distinguished
newspaper reporting.

The $500 prize was awarded to
Woltman for his exclusive 1946
dispatch which revealed. the Com’-
munist party’s inﬁltration method
for gaining control of labor un-
ions, and for influencing Ameri-

can thinking in educational," plo-‘ .

litical, and other ﬁelds. He dis-
closed that the party accomplish-
ed this work by u-sing the names
of prominent persons’ to spread
communist propaganda.

Woltman received his AB from
the College here in __1927, and his
MA in 1928. He taught, philosophy
and ethics at Pitt before he join-
ed, the staff of the’ World Tele-
gram in 1929.

In 1929 he co-authored an ar-
ticle, “Murder by Coal and Iron
Police,” which appeared in’ the
March 20, 1929, issue of The Na-
tion. ‘

” P-ennsylvania’s governor object-
ed to Woltman’s criticisms of po-
lice brutality during coal strikes.
The University ﬁred Woltman and
“The Telegram” hired him the
same year.

In 1933 VWoltman received hon-
orable mention, from the Pulitzer
Prize committee for “clear, exact
and understanding writing in re-
porting the status of various
banks in suburban areas of New
York after thenational bank holi-
day.”. ‘

Au] Over

Bill Aul, production manager
for Pitt Players’ current “Joan of
Lorraine,” was literally swept off
his feet at rehearsals last Monday.

A misplaced broom, falling from

one of the catwalks above the Fos-
ter memorial stage, struck the
budding Zeigfeld a glancing blow
on the head, necessitating a trip
to the Presbyterian hospital and
three stitches to cure the result-
ing “gaposis of the brain.”

Aul, ever ready to capitalize
on an opportunity for free public-
ity for Players oﬁered to repeat
the performance during the shows
tonight and tomorrow.

.“Sure, I’ll do anything to _get
people out to see the show. It’s

really great,” said Bill as he ab-'

sent—minded1y wandered off to E

Bus. Ad.Dean
Addresses

Business Men

Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of the
School of Business Administration,
spoke to business men at a lunch-

neon last Tuesday in: the Hotel

Henry ballroom on “The G. I. in
College?’ The luncheon was one

of a series sponsored'by the Credit 2

Association of Western‘ Pennsyl-
Vania.

“We have never had such ﬁne
students in our history,” he said,“
“and the veterans are among the
best of them.” —

Since enrollment in the School

-of Business Administration is lim-

ited, the standards must be kept
high, he explained. However, the
maturity of the Veterans has made
a lot of difference in their work:

Today’s students, according to
Dr. Lanfear, are more serious.
“They work harder than any We
have had before. Many veterans
have families to think about and
put more into their studies.

“Failures are less than in pre-
vious years,” Dr. Lanfear said.
When students do fail, it is usually
because they work in addition to
their studies. T

Dr. Lanfear is s~chedpled to
speak this evening to the,Rotary
club at Zelienople on the same
subject.

Needs Copies

Mrs. Agnes L. Starrett, Univer-
sity editor, is asking for any ex-
tra copies of the Winter 1947 num-
ber of Pitt Quarterly. The extra
copies are needed to supply the
State Department with 300 issues.

In a letter sent to Dr. John G.
Bowman, Carl A. Sauer, assist-
ant chief of libraries and insti-
tutes division, stated, “This issue
would provide a valuable aid in
presenting to foreign students, ed-
ucators and educational institutions
a concept of the programs, ideals’,
and achievements of great Ameri-
can universities. It would be ap-
preciated, therefore, if copies could
be placed in the collections of ma-
terials on American educational
institutions which are maintained
at United States Information Li-
braries, Cultural Institutes, and
other posts abroad in connection
with the Department’s program
of international cultural rela-
tions.”

Last Sunday the TPA’s ate
breakfast in honor of Founder’s
Day, and in the afternoon they
drank tea for mothers’ sakes. The
Phi—Sigs also will be eating and
drinking with mother this Sun-
day at their annual Mothers’ Day
luncheon at the Schenley.

Thirteen became the lucky
number for the Alpha Phi Alpha’s
as they presented pins to that
many at a recent initiation. They
honored the new men with a
brotherhood banquet at A South
Park and then a formal Cotton
ball at the Savoy ballroom.

The Phi Mu’s are gloating over
the gigantic district convention
held here last weekend. It seems
their California pride and joy, the
national president from Los An-
geles, dropped i.n for’ the plane
ride.

Here’s the word from the Pi
Lams: “The Pi Lams had a skat-
ing party at Lexington and ini-
tiated eight men.” Must have been
some skates!

Beta Sig’s newly elected offic-
ers (three weeks old to date) are
Lois Etzel, Pat Hartman, Dolores
Hartman, and Grace Freund. The
Delta Chi Rho otiicers for the next
year are Ruth Caplan, Bernice
Nathanson, Harriet Bernstein, and
Maxine Goodfriend.

The Sigs published this month’s
issue of the “Panther Sig” and
they did a great job. Best feature
was a write—up by Herky Knell,
past president, on their fraternal
bond.

Student congress this week re-
ceived a call for representatives
to attend the Constitutional Con-
vention of the National Student
organization at the University of
“Wisconsin this September. Action
on. the invitation awaits installa-
tion of the new Congress May 1.

The NSO is the outgrowth of
plans laid by representatives from
“‘over 300 colleges and universities
who met last December upon the
recommendation of American del-
egates to the International Union
of Students at Prague. During the
December meeting a National Con-
tinuations committee was appoint-
ed to draw up a draft constitution
and maintained a temporary or-
ganization until a permanent union
could be set up.

The Constitutional convention.
as set up by the NCC will be held
early‘ in September from one to
two weeks. Delegates from all col-
leges listed in the Department of
Education bulletin will be re-
ceived in proportion to their en-
rollment: A delegation from Pitt

John Grimes, past president of
the Veterans association, and Stu-

adopted the idea for a living
memorial after learning of a sim-
ilar plan of the Ohio State vets at
the football game last fall. The
Buckeyes have raised a large
amount for their scholarship plan
by campus activities and coopera-
tion from Columbus merchants.

After returning to Pitt, the
scholarship idea became a major
goal for the organization leaders.

Bob Malloy had two years to go as a biology major when
he dropped out of Pitt in 1941 to sign with the Cincinnati Reds.
Today, he’s the only former Pitt athlete in the big leagues. The
natural question~is: Do you regret signing before you com-
pleted college?

“Not for a minute,” he replied. “I say this to any college
player: If you can get a good bonus, sign. But, you should
make certain that you can stick in pro ball, and also, that you
can make enough to pay for your education.

“You have to remember,” he added, “the player usually
receives two-thirds less than the sum the papers claim he was
signed for.” . V * =r= *

Bob spent two seasons in the

recorded a 15-6 mark with the

Softball

Rain still held the upper hand
in the intramural softball tourna-
ment as the weather man prom-
ised no immediate change in the
moisture laden skies.

_ About the only divisions seeing
much action are the three inter-

‘fraternity groups, with the Phi

Delt’s andithe Phi Ep’s 3-0 and
the Theta Chi’s 2-0 records lead-
ing in their respective leagues.
Quite a few outstanding games
were held this past week but the
most sensational was Bruce Gil-
bert’s no—hit, no-run game pitched
for his Phi Ep team against the
Alpha Phi Delts. Although Gilbert

_‘was liberal with his free passes,

giving eight, he still had good.con-
trol, especially in the fourth in-

hinge when he walked three men

in a row and then put the next

1 three out. Two spectacular catches

by Germise and Gernoff helped
_Gilbert’s cause along. The Phi Eps
scored six  ‘on a homer by
Miller and Brody’s V three boom-
ing hits._ ,

Spectacular in quite the oppo-

isite way was the Med Froshs’

blasting of the ROTC team as the

medical students scored a record‘

31 runs and ’38 hits. The most
startling inning was the second
when the Med Frosh ,batted
around almost four’ times scor-
ing 24 times and bombarding the
hapless pitchers with 27 hits! The
ROTC boys? They scored‘, too.

Nine Shows

Good Record

Baseball coach Ralph Mitterling
has won a shower of praise for
bringing the Pitt baseball team
through a highly successful sea-
son. The overﬂow of GI’s has con-
tributed toward skyrocketing
Pitt’s baseball fortunes to a new
peak.

The Jungle Cats opened the sea-

. son at home by thumping Cali-

fornia teachers, 13-8. It was a

game not entirely lacking in hu_rn- '

orous aspects, for a chap named

V A A1 Tkac pitched the entire ‘nine

innings for California, despite

_Pitt’s thirteen tallies.

Following the opener, the Pan-
thers left their home lair to ad-

:minister to Salem a 9-5 defeat, "
with rightﬁelder Johnny Wascieko
slapping out three hits.

Returning. home, the Mitterling
men downed a tough West. iV_'ir-
ginia team, 7-5, behind the tight
pitching of Deryl Calder. It was
Calder’s second win, and it had
now become evident that Mitter-
ling intended to rely on Calder to
do the bulk of his pitching.

And then the Panthers walked
into an ambush. Just as they were
riding high, a J uniata pitcher,
Dick Frick, stepped up and cooled

Tthe red-hot Jungle Cats on two
‘hits. The Panthers returned home

smarting from an 8-2 defeat.

So they turned around and
vented their wrath on California
teachers by handing the Vulcans
a 9-1 shellacking. Calder pitched
a - three—hitter.

This victory was followed by a
5-3 win over Clarion. Johnny
Gennock’s bat led the way, as big
Howard Sc-ott got credit for the
win by relieving Bobby Lucchino
in the third. -

Then Penn State came to town.
Panther pitchers became generous

_with .walks, ﬁelders were liberal

with misplays, and ‘the results
were 7-1 and 7-2 victories for -the
Staters. ‘ ,

But when the season ended yes-
terday at St. Vincent, Pittites were
satisﬁed that they had been well
represented on the baseball dia-

mond this year. 1
