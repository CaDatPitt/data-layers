NCAA to changeTournament graduation standards

Ryan Shaughnessy

Less than half of the players in the NCAA
Tournament are required to graduate, a
percentage that education ofﬁcials want
to change.

Standing at the bus stop outside Litchﬁeld
Towers at Fifth and Thackeray avenues, Bas-
tion has to hop on and off different buses in
order to get to Bellevue.

Now, she has to get on the 71B or the 71A,
then get off at Wood Street Downtown. From
there, she has to get on the 16B Brighton
or 13 Bellevue. The entire trip takes about
an hour.

Bastion’s friend senior Katie Linkhauer
is also experiencing frustrations because of
the bus route.cuts.

. She said that the bus schedule has com- ‘

pletely dictated her daily life, so she tries to
rely on it as little as possible.

, She works at the Giant Eagle in Shadyside,
and usually walks there when the weather is
nice. Shesaid that she can usually walk there
faster than a bus can take her there, and she
doesn’t have to wait around for it.

Freshmen Braden Downey and Ryan Eck-
ley were standing at the bus stop on Forbes
Avenue outside the Barco Law School. They
were onthe way to see “Sucker Punch” at the
AMC Loews Waterfront Theater. ,

Sophomore Alex Bennett, perched on top
of a wall next to Downey and Eckley, said that
students might not completely comprehend
how deep the cuts are yet because they don’t
feel a lot of the immediate impacts.

“And a lot of the students think we can’t

He was on his way to buy black paint at the
Waterfront for a coﬂin. Bennett, an intern for
PennPIRG — an organization that advocates
for public transit 9- is helping to organize a
memorial tomorrow night for the 500 route

We love free

IIGWS

If the public’s discontent over The
New York Times’ online paywall
-— which goes into effect today —
tells us anything, it’s that people
love to get things for free.

Luckily, all non-College of Gen-
eral Studies undergraduate Pitt
students can still access the on-
line edition of the Times through
the Student Government Board’s
College Readership Program, a re-
cently enacted program that brings
students copies of The New York
Times and USA Today through the
Student Activities Fund.

SGB President Molly Stieber
said one of the main goals of the
readership program was to provide
students with access to the Times
after the publication started charg-
ing for online subscriptions.

To access to Times’ content,

students must send an e—mail to'

edu@nytimes.com from their Pitt
e—mail accounts. According to an
announcement on the my.pitt.edu
portal, you must write “Access to
NYT Replica Edition” in the subject
line of the e-mail, and the body
of the e—mail should say “Please
set me up for access to the NYT
Replica Edition; my name is (ﬁrst
name + last name).”

We’re unsure of whether the
transaction will succeed if you fail
to write “please.”

Students should sign up as soon
as possible, as the announcement
on the portal notes that the pro-
cess can take one to two business
days.

It’s called a “Replica Edition,”
and Stieber said the content is the
same as you would see if you sub-
scribed to any online edition.

And although she said some.

kinks are still being worked out
with the program, she believes,stu—
dents will be e—mailed with a login

and password to access content on '
- nytimes.com.

The content will only be avail-
able to students until graduation,
despite the fact that pitt.edu ac-
counts are not deactivated until

months after graduation. Stieber‘

said this is to make sure that only
students paying the activity fee can
access the Times.
Unfortunately, the future of
the readership program is unsure.
Stieber said she doesn’t foresee the
Student Activities Fund being able
to sustain the program, although
she would love to see the program
renewed through other means. She
said she is currently talking to Res-
idence Life director Shawn Brooks
about additional options.
Currently, $30,500 from the
fund is used to payfor the pro-

' gram out of the $1 million that

SGB is responsible for allocating.
Students pay an $80 activity fee
each semester. ' ~

So although access to the Times
is not exactly “free” to Pitt students
either, it’s at least nice to not have
to pay a separate fee. Instead, you
can save your money for delicious

$5 pizzas. I ' '

College students lazy? Maybe not

Writer disagrees with study that finds students are slackers

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

Many people are too busy with
YouTube and Twitter and Fa-
cebook and Smartphones and
dumbphones and Tamagotchis
to read a Sunday paper like they
did back in the good ol’ days, so
I v_vouldn’t be surprised if you
saw a study out of the Univer-
sity of California in the Pitts-
burgh Post-Gazette. The study
says that college students are a

bunch of slackers: The average

time per week an undergradu-
ate spends studying hasvfallen

from 24 hours a week in 1961

to 14 hours today. The decline
in study times has been across
disciplines, including engineer-
ing and hard sciences.

You damn kids, you ‘just
don’t know how to work hard.

But-before people make wise-
cracks about how We’re earning
Bachelor of Sloth degrees here
at college, the study needs to

be looked at carefully. Society
might not want to write us all
off as slugs just yet.
Technology allows us to
work in a much more efficient
manner than our foreparents.
You don’t need to spend time
looking at trigonometry tables

or fiddling with your slide‘rule. -

You don’t write your papers

1 on a typewriter, and you don’t

have to spend time wandering
the stacks at thelibrary or us-

ing a paper card catalog. The

study authors say technology
can’t explain the decline in
study times‘, since the largest
declines in study times were
between 1961 and 1981, before
technology really took off. But
this blanket conclusion is a bit
of a stretch. It. could be that
today we work just as hard as
students did in_the 1980s but

' have better tools to do so. It-

is unreasonable, then, to con-
clude that study effort is in

continuous decline. It is pos-
sible that there was an initial
precipitous drop in study effort

between 1961 and 1981 and that‘

since then effort has remained
ﬂat, with technology account-

‘ ing for the smaller decrease in

study time since 1981.

The paper itself is reasonably
convincing, and it appears that
the authors werecareful about
noting confounding factors.
They do fumble, however,’in
some of their conclusions, like
saying that people who -study

d harder make more money later

on, implying a causal relation
between these variables. This,
of course, disregards the huge

-probability that thosefmore

likely to be go-getters in the
classroom are also more likely
to be go—getters in the work-
place. I would also haveliked to

see some more of the nuts and‘

bolts of the study itself, handy
things like what margin of error

' was being used, how many stu-

dents were surveyed and where
all the snazzy charts that are
thrown at us come from.
Despite‘ these shortcomings,
the study is probablynot com-
pletely bogus. But a decrease
in average study times doesn’t
mean we’re all just punks who

percent had completed eighth

grade at most. Those who want-

ed to do just enough work to
get by  probably didn’t go to
college. .

Nowadays, a high school di-
ploma doesn’t get you much of

\

anywhere. Doing enough work ‘

to get by now means going to
college, earning straight Cs and
ﬁnding ajob..Adding students

who want to do the minimum,

by nature skewed by the sorts
of students taking them. GPAs
might not be the best guide
here because of the possibil-
ity of grade inﬂation.

Does the decreasein study

time lead to a decrease in skills-

acquisition? This is ultimately
the more important research

“question, and it is-premature

for us -to bemoa'nf'American

This is ultimately the more important

know more about beer than
Bramante or more-about vodka
than Voltaire, or that we can’t
use the word “perquisite” in a
sentence correctly. '

Perhaps the decline in study
time is an artifact of the very
real change in who went to col-

-lege in 1961 and who goes to

college now. In 1961, one could
get reasonably far on a high-

school diploma. College educa— .

tion was the perquisite of those
who were especially talented,
driven or wealthy. Only 10 per-
cent of the population had a
college degree in 1960, and 42

. amount of work to get by would

move the average study time
downward. , e

Of course, lost in this paper
is the question of whether or
not any of this is actually impor-
tant. Let us grant kids today are
spending less time with their
faces in books than they used
to. So what? Is the outcome of
all this studying or lack thereof
the same or worse than before?
We can’t tell — oops 4 because
unlike in Europe, our colleges

.don’t have undergraduate exit

exams, and the GREs and other
tests for postgraduate study are

this one study that measures
inputs, not outputs. The study
demands some sort. of follow-
up, both here and overseas,
and it seems a tad unfair to

draw broad conclusions like

“American students are lazy
ignoramuses,” tempting as that
might be.

One thing is clear, though.
At least somebody thinks you
should put down this paper and
go hit the books. ’

Letter tothe editor

To the editor,

I am extremely disappointed in the Pitt Program Council’s choice of
Ke$ha for Bigelow Bash. If trendy is what it was going for, I think that
a MUCH better choice would have_been Rebecca Black. _

Not only is Rebecca’s song “Friday” catchier than any of Ke$ha’s, she’s
also much classier. If Rebecca’s worst problem in her life is which seat
to take, then she’s someone I want to be around.

Even Lady Gaga thinks that Rebecca is “a genius,” as quoted in E!
News. . _ ' 

Obviously she’s a genius; she knows the days of the week.

Let’s be honest, who wouldn’t want to rock out to a 13-year-old who gets
famous on YouTube (I don’t countjustin Bieber)?
All in all, I think that Rebecca Black is hot and Ke$ha is not.

Sincerely,

Amanda Stepp .

Letter to the editor

To the Editor,
Reality:

(Jerusalem) Last Wednesday, I left work and thoughtlessly hopped
aboard the bus. At the same time, a terrorist thoughtfully placed a bomb,
disguised as abag, in acrowded bus stop in the center ofjerusalem. Two
minutes later one of my students walked down the bus aisle with her friend
and sat down in the seats right in front of me.

As my bus approached the stop, a kiosk owner noticed an unidenti-
ﬁed bag and called the police. As he talked, the bomb exploded. I felt the
blast and the reverberating explosion! Glass and people were everyone.
It took what felt like forever for the bus doors to open. I grabbed my
student and her friend. We ran out of fear of a secondary explosion and
didn’t look back. '

Imagine: g

(Pittsburgh) You are standing at the Atwood Street bus stop and the
61C pulls up -— you push your way to the front of the line, ﬂash your Pitt
ID, maneuver your way to the back of the bus, and squeeze into a seat. You
look over, see a classmate and start chatting about the exam you just took.
As you continue your conversation the bus pulls up to the packed stop at
Forbes Avenue and Bigelow’Boulevard. Suddenly: BOOM, the bus shakes,
everyone screams — glass, metal and blood are everywhere 

It can be easy to develop a political opinion while sitting in the calm
of the Cathedral of Learning. Sometimes it helps to impart a hint of real-
ism to world events by taking a_quiet moment to create a personalized
experience.

Randi Alu
Staﬁ Writer

Pittsburgh universities have one
more thing to compete for — the
winning spot in the Steeltown
Film Factory Competition.

The ﬁnalists are Philip Beard,
Christopher Dimond and Yulin
Kuang. Beard is a Pitt law school
graduate, Dimond attended both
Duquesne and CMU and Kuang is
a CMU student.

Yet, the mood in the Point
Park University GRW Theater
during the competition’s Pro-
ducer’s Pitch Saturday was that
of camaraderie. This competition
is designed to showcase the ﬁlm-
making talent of Pittsburgh and
foster the growth of this talent.

Amateur ﬁlmmakers submit a
screenplay that is no longer than
12 pages in length. The competi-
tion was whittled from more than
125 people to the six who stood in
front of the judges to be divided
in half at this second—to—last part
of the competition. The winner
will receive a $30,000 prize to
make his ﬁlm. The winner will
be decided April 30.

Each semiﬁnalist had a chance
to explain his budget plan and

intentions as well as answer the
judges’ questions. Then after a
deliberation, the judging came
to a conclusion. Carl Kurlander,
Steeltown Film Factory’s execu-
tive producer and the event’s
moderator, cast a sympathetic
glance at the semiﬁnalists, and
said, “We do have to choose three
out of six, but we see this as a
process.” He encouraged each
contestant to continue pursuing
the creation of their work, even if
they don’t go to the ﬁnal round.

This year the competition has
been particularly close, said Film
Factory producer Lisa Smith,

adding that, “usually we have ﬁve ,

semiﬁnalists; it was so close, we
have six.” ,

The event opened with a ﬁlm
highlighting the deep connec-
tions that Pittsburgh has with
the ﬁlm industry. Pittsburgh has
“incubated a lot of talent,” Kur-
lander said. “There’s a loyalty.
Pittsburghers are very good at
not giving up.”

The three judges then intro-
duced themselves as John Del-
laverson, producer of “Diary of a
Mad Black Woman”; Bernie Gold-
mann, producer of “300”; and
Chris Moore, producer of “Good
Will Hunting” — all veterans of

the production side of the ﬁlm
industry.

The three scripts that were
chosen to move on:

“Savesies” by Philip Beard

“It reveals character; Pitts-
burgh character,” Beard, an at-
torney and Pitt law school alum-
nus, said of his script.

The plot follows two neighbors
who have both claimed a parking
spot on their road for their moth-
ers. The script is written in the
Pittsburgh dialect, and includes
a slow-motion scene.

Beard used the example of the
“Seinfeld” episode about parking
as a comparison. Instead of be-
ing selﬁsh, Pittsburgh character
shines through and the lead man
realizes he must relinquish the
spot because his mother is not
the ﬁrst one to show up to park
there.

For Beard, who has published
two novels, this was the “culmina-
tion of a long process of making
a transition from a much longer
form  I was very excited. You
know, I have always wanted to
write for ﬁlm.” ,

“Flour Baby” by Christopher
Dimond .

“Flour Baby” is centered on

thecommon high school project

of caring for a fake baby, which
Dimond, who taught at Cen-
tral Catholic High School for a
few years, said is still a project

.in some schools. Dimond now

writes plays and musicals and
recently — along with collabo-
rator Michael Kooman — and
has received several honors and
awards.

. Dimond explained that his
script, “at its heart, is about a
young girl who is forced to con-
front her past.”

The script makes a social
commentary on abortion and is
a “dark story that has some com-
edy,” Dimond stated. He decided
he’d like to be assistant direc-
tor for his ﬁlm, as participants
may choose what part they’d like

to play in the creation of their

ﬁlm. Still, despite being in the
top three, he’s not positive that
he will get the chance to make his
movie with the $30,000.

“I don’t necessarily know that
I’ll win. Ithink the three scripts
that are left are all really strong.
It’s really easy in this industry to
fall into a competitive feeling, but
I don’t think that’s the case with
anyone from the Film Factory;
they are all really supportive and
encouraging there.”

Competition.

“First Kiss” by Yulin Kuang

Kuang is a junior at Carnegie
Mellon University who studies
creative writing.

She said that her script is “an
exploration of the myth of the
ﬁrst kiss” that draws from her
own coming’-of—age story and
“the agony of being 14.”

The storyline follows a young
teen boy who ﬁnds out that a girl
wants to kiss him at a spin—the-
bottle party.

“I don’t think I’ll win overall.
I really do love this script," she
said.‘ ‘

The familiar hormonal and
emotional turmoil in the main
character is what drives her idea
forward.

“I worked very hard, and it
was nice that there was a payoff.
It was one of the happiest mo-
ments I’ve had,” she explained.
“I’d like to win because I think
it’d really be good for other young
ﬁlmmakers in Pittsburgh to show
what we can do.”.Kuang intends
on directing her ﬁlm.

The next stage of the Steel-
town Film Factory’s competition
is a performance of each of the
three ﬁnalists’, scripts at CMU
by CMU drama students on April
30. I

Bands battle to raise money for Save the Music“,

Kirstin Kennedy
For The’Pitt News

Nordy’s Place in the William Pitt Union
rocked Saturday evening as four bands
fought for the No. 1 spot in WPTS’ Battle of
the Bands beneﬁt for VH1’s Save the Music
Foundation. ’ y A
The nonproﬁt foundation raises money"
to restore elementary schools’ music pro-
grams by providing instruments to public
school districts. Attendees of the event
were asked to make a $3 donation to the
foundation. _
The performing bands-included, in
the order in which they played: Sleepy V,

White Like Fire, Otis and Shadow Puppets’ .

Sleepover. Each band played between four

‘and sixsongs in front of a clrowcllbf about ’
40ipeople and three judges. WPTS station ‘
managerand Battle of the Bands judge '
Charlie Lotz explained that the bands ,

would be judged on a combination of mu-
sical ability, creativity on stage and crowd
participation.

The ultimate award went to the band
White Like Fire, which lead vocalist and
guitaristiBlake Clawson says has antin-
die-pop sound. Before the band began to
‘perform, Clawson ran all around N ordy’s,

telling the audience members to get out
of their seats and up to the frontjfor the
show. ~ '

His band warmed up, the crowd with
a sound check that featured a faster rock
version of M.I.A.’s “Paper Planes.” The song
was full of powerful vocals from Clawson
and a cymbal and drum solo to represent
the gun shots and cash register compo-
nents of the original version. -

In addition, the band performed three‘

-of-'it_s original songs and an upbeatcover

of The Beatles’ “Help!”

“We had a two-hour practice right be-
fore the show,” Clawson said. Not all of
the members of White Like Fire live in the

Pittsburgh area, leaving them to often pull
L pallinighters for band practice.  . I

 

 elekinesis is our mainform of com-
m1‘fni'cation,” Clawsonjoked. §.‘_But7it’s a lot
of fun. We usuallyvpractice all night before
a shew the next day.” _ * A

The other members of White Like Fire
are Ty Clawson on the bass and vocals and
Joe Naylor on the drums and vocals.

[Sleepy V, the ﬁrst band to perform, re_- 1

ceived cheers from the audience when its
members got on stage. Bass player Ben
Greenwood called the music of Sleepy V an
“indie-folk—pop” musical hybrid. Though

the band incorporates a trumpet, played
by memberjohn Manganaro, it avoids the
ska genre. _ —

The songs performed seemed very

complicated. In particular, the song “A
Few Weeks Without Laguna Beach” fea-
tured multiple parts and solos and ended
abruptly.  ,
“Each part of a song comes from an indi-
vidual mind,” Greenwood said. “But there
are so many parts to one of our songs, it’s
like it all comes together in one mind.”

In addition to Greenwood and Man— '

ganaro, the band features Gene Paul Ver-
cammen on lead vocals and guitar as well
as Derek Krystek on the drums.

The third band,_.Otis<,‘ traveled from, -
Erie,Pa., to perform. Itssongs —featu’re’c‘l"a‘3’ ‘_ ’

‘ more rock—based sound-’whereas,its'l§flﬁ:cs
gravitated towardldeseriptions ofanimals _

and analyses of Erie-based‘hobos’af1’d lu-
natics. ‘ I A A
Closing the Battle of the Bands was
Shadow Puppets’ Sleepover.
Its music featured more harsh sounds
than the mellow tones of Sleepy V and the

fast pace of White Like_Fire. It performed,
a series’ of original songs and. made fre—~ I ‘
quent jokes in between playing its songs ,

switching sets.

All the proceeds of the event beneﬁted
VH1’s Save the Music Foundation. WPTS
chose that particular group as an effort to
get more involved in the Pitt community.

“It’s a great or'g’anization,”‘ Lotz said.
“Public schools have been rolling back OE‘
their spending for music education, and
Save the Musicireally lines up with what
we represent.” 1 O

The organization was very receptive in
communicating with WPTS.

“They loved it,” said Akua Pokuaa
Owusu—Acheaw, promotional director for
WPTS. “It isa really creative organization, ~
and we think people will want to come [to
the Battle of the Bands] to support their
friends and tap. i'I'1’to,tha .” . F ' ‘ P

.To be eligfibleto.‘participate, bands

‘had to send  a sample of their musf?‘
as well as a $20 fee that went directly to

Save the Music.

_ Many of the audience members attended 4
the Battle of the Bands to support friends
who were performing. '

“I got a Facebook invitation and my
friend might play, so I wanted to come see
it,”. freshman Sean Brady said. »

CONCERT REVIEW

Jeffrey Ihaza
Staff Writer

Atlanta—based rapper B.o.B attests to having
“the magic inhim,” and for Pitt Program Coun-
cil’s annual concert, he delivered just that. '

On Saturday night B.o.B took the stage of
the Fitzgerald Field House with local Atlanta

‘ rapper Playboy Tre and winners of WPTS’ hip-

hop battle, The One Twos. Students ﬂooded the
ﬁeld house with B.o.B paraphernalia as well as
‘homemade shirts with phrases such as: “Pitt
loves B.o.B,” and “Take me on stage please.”
The opening act, Pitt-based hip-hop group
The One Twos, delivered an energy-infused

opening act full of well-delivered punch lines 7'‘

and production similar to The Neptunes. The
One '1Wos set a relatively high bar for the main
act to live up to. _ '
Fortunately for the crowd that packed the
Fitzgerald Field House — tickets were $5 —

the main act delivered heartily. B.o.B jumped _

on stage full of energy and asked the audience
if they were familiar with‘his most recent mix-
tape No Genre — most of the crowd had never
heard of it.

“That’s all right. Y’all about to ﬁnd out,” B.o.B

, said as he jumped right into‘ the bass-heavy

“Beast Mode,” infecting the audience with an
electric vibe was crowd—surfers emerged and
dancing commenced.

B.o.B. played a concert sponsored by the Pitt Program Council on Saturday.

to every student in attendance, B.o.B slowed
it down and asked the audience for a pair of
shades. One lucky girl inthe front row appeared
onthe giantscreenasshe handed B.o.B herpair
of red sunglasses. ‘

“How many of y’all got shades right now.

Bring ’em out!” B.o.B said as he performed the .

ﬁrst verse of “Past My Shades,” in a cappella.
Soon hewas infullforce and the energy level
in the crowd returned to 100 percent as people
raised their various brands of sunglasses in the
air. By this pointinthe show, itwas Playboy Tre’s
turn to show the audience what he could do.
He gave the crowd a taste of real southern
rap sound with the trunk—banging “Bet I.” By
the end of the song, B.o.B had strapped up his

guitar and was ready to slow things down with —

“Don’t Let Me Fall.”

Toward the end of the concert, B.o.B opened -

the ﬂoor for suggestions. ”What y’al1 want me
to play next?” he asked as he turned the micro-

V phone toward the audience.

A collective chant of “Airplanes,” was gen-
erated from the front of the crowd, and one
student in the back made the customary rock-
concert request for “Freebird,” to no avail.

After what seemed like the end of the show,
B.o.B returned to stage and performed “Magic,”
with ‘characteristic charm as members of the
audience danced and jumped. on command.

Altogether, B.o.B put on a decidedly high-
octane performance that everyone from die-
hard fans to pop-music haters could enjoy.

_ Gray‘ was initially moved to
quarterback to start the spring,
but the coaching staff changed his
position once again to safety. But it
is very possible that he will return to ~
the offensive side of the ball when
training camp begins in August.

Myers has impressed the new

and sheer physical ability so far this
spring. ‘

“The guy can spin it with the best
of them,” quarterbacks coach Tony
Dodge said. “I’m really pleased with
him. He’s a lot more athletic than
most big guys. He does some things
with his feet that I didn’t think he
would be able to do. The speed of
the game for Mark is continuously
starting to slow down [as he learns

‘ the offense].”

losophy has been a big change for
- Myers, but he’s beginning to adapt
well to it.
“I feel like it’s a lot different from

Gonzalez appears to remain
the outsider for the quarterback

raised some eyebrows early on
this spring.

“We think he’s a guy who is very
athletic,” Dodge said. “He has im-
proved, as much as any of them,
in a four—day window as far as his
footwork and accuracy throwing

Sunseri’s experience continues
to be thesticking point, and it will

said. “I think that Tino took his 13

sion will carry a lot of weight. He
ﬁnds the quarterback position
of the utmost value to a football
team, but especially so in his of-.
fense that relies so heavily on the
quarterback,

“All three of them are now
watching extra ﬁlm and competing
to get better,” Grahamsaid. “The
quarterback position is a lot like the
head coach position. You will either

COLUMN

Pirates always consistent

Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

Chaos seems to rule the world.

Instead of life following a
predictable pattern, we live in
an age of constant upheaval. In
just the past month, we have been
greeted with unrest in North Af-
rica seemingly out of nowhere
and a combination of an earth-
quake and tsunami that nearly
knocked out the world’s third-
largest economy.

Even in sports, nothing seems
to be firm, with No. 1-seeded bas-
ketball teams ﬁnding themselves
subjected to the whims of fouls
and No. 8—seeded opponents.

But in this age of change —
where today’s iPhone 4 is tomor-

row’s iPhone 3 — I have a secret-

to keeping my bearings straight; a
constant in my life whose stabil-
ity transcends all else. ,
_ And it just so happens it plays
on the North Side. 4 ~
I am speaking, of course,

about the beloved Pittsburgh Pi-
rates — the most constant team
in baseball according to my own
analysis of baseball records since
1993. For whereas the Yankees?‘
and Braves are consistently good
and the Bluejays are consistently
average, the Pirates have taken
the gold medal in terms of team
consistency since I became a self-
aware human being.

Now I know many of you nay-
sayers, especially those of you
sporting Phillies affections, might
be thinking to yourself, “Yeah,
constantly bad” — to you folks
I say, “Real original.” You might

be wondering how I can be de-‘:"‘ y

fending a team whose record for
the past 19 seasons makes Chris
Brown look like a winner.

Well, remember to first con-
sider baseball’s role as a sport

in American culture. It isn’t all _

sport about excitement or dar-
ing feats of physical prowess like
football, nor is it about roughness

and overpowering your opponent through
aggression like hockey. And despite many
notable stars, the sport isn’t really about
individual superstars in the way profes-
sional basketball is, either.

Instead — both through deliberative
marketing moves by Major League‘ Baseball
and the sport’s age — baseball is treated
and thought of as America’s pastime. Yes,
there are high degrees of athleticism in
some players and there are certainly very
exciting moments, but overall the sport’s
strength comes from its deep sense of tra-
dition and its strong cultural connection
to the past. .

And since I have been a conscious, self-
assertive Pirates fan since the mid-1990s,
the team’s outstanding consistency has
only made this connection stronger for
me. It serves as a constant presence in my
life. For instance, every year of my high
school career the Pirates’ ﬁnal loss total
never surpassed ﬁve games. In the year of
the highest S&P 500 average when adjusted
for inﬂation since my birth —— 2000 — the
Pirates had 93 wins.

So instead of looking at Pirates fans
as an oddity, remember that as a baseball
team — as a connection to the past — they
have been doing pretty well. Through na-
tional and personal changes in real life, I
have always counted on the Pirates to give
me the same thing.

This kind of consistency is good for
Pirates fans, too. The World Health Organi-

MCCps

zation lists rapid social change as a factor
for bad mental health. What, then, could be
healthier than experiencing the social and
emotional calm that accompanies being 21
Pirates fan? Possiblynothing. I
Now some of you same naysayers might
believelall I am doing is rationalizing 18

_ terrible seasons of baseball. After all, very

few fans use the World Health Organiza-
tion to justify their team. But remember
I am not justifying the Pirates as a sports
team, but as a piece of baseball culture
— a culture of consistency that makes its
fandom unique.

I would absolutely trade this culture of
consistency to get a World Series win, and

7 I am not going to pretend I enjoy watching

my team lose. It is also painful to watch
Pirates fans older than myself —— who re-
member the early ’90s or ’70s —— endure
these terrible seasons.

But when I am an old man, looking back
at a long life and what will surely be an even
longer list of Pirates World Series wins —
not this year guys, we’ll probably only get
the Pennant — I will be able to look back
at the Pirates as a nice thread providing
continuity to my formative years.

After all, real life already has enough
ups and downs. Why would I want a team
that only extends this reality?

E—mail Nick at nps13@pitt.edu with any
poetic ruminations you may have about
the Pirates. Please .don’t swear. -

“*3 ‘E.

l5a_nthers hope to gain momentum heading into postseason

Nate Barnes
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s tennis team is at its tipping

point. Altera3—4 startto the season, the Panthers

posted another3—4 stretchintheir recent matches
and are looking to turn the season around.

At 6-8 overall and with only six matches re-
maining on the schedule before‘Pitt heads to

A South. Bend, Ind_., for the Big East tournament,

the Pantherswant to ﬁnishthe season strong
and enter the postseason witliismoinentum on
theirside. .' ‘ I  is    a

With ﬁve consecutive,winnirig-seasons be-
hind it, the 2010-11 squad wantsto continue that
streak, and also to place high in the Big East. No
Pitt team has ﬁnished higher than 7th in the Big
East in the 30 years that Pitt has beena part of
the conference.

V   ‘ Overspring break, the players got a chance to

escﬁapesthe cold: and dreary Pittsburgh weather
and-ufavel to warm and sunny Ft. lisauderdale,
Fla, fora pair of matches.’

' P The ﬁrst match resulted in a toughloss for
_Pitt by ascore of 5-4to No. 22-' Nova Soutlieastern
University. Freshmenjocelyn Lu and Kimmy
Borzawere the onlytwo playerstopull out singles
wins, whereas the doubles teams tooktwo out of
three matches to pull close._

But the Panthers could not get one more vic-
tory to push them over theedge and into the
 column. = * P - r

The next day, Pitt took on the University of St.
Thomas, looking to go .500 on the trip and pull
closerto awinningrecord. The team did justthat,
eamingavictory in dominatingfashion, 8-1. The
only loss came atﬁrst singles, as Elizabeth Adams
wasforced to retire from the matchwithan injury
when she was down, 4-5, in the ﬁrst set.

Except for that onesetback, the other ﬁve
singles players were domiriant-a—' not one player
dropped aset— and they only lostatotal of nine
games, collectively. A V’   . ‘S’ .. 

“It was really fun, and great to be there as
a team,” Borza said. ‘fit nice to be able to
actually get outsidIeandtr_ain_ weather.
We lost a tough onef'to:Nova.,South:éasterii, and
it was a little controversial  happened.
But we came back    and

dominated St. Thomas.-fl}  “‘

Upon its returnfro  lFlpﬁda,Pitt-thefnlostto

go inilitfslfavor came on avictoriy at-first singles
at thehand of sophomore Gabrielle Catanzaril" ' P ‘ti,
ﬁlling in for Adams, who was still outwith the
injury sustained during the previous match.
Pitt then regrouped against another BigEast
opponent, Providence. Pitt pulled to 5-6 overall
with adominant7-0 shutout. The freshman tan-
dem of Lu and Borza dropped the No. 1 doubles
match, 8-5, but the two other teams ran rough-
shod overtheir opponents. V. '

Parbhu and Minh Evans at No. 3 each won their
matches 8-0.

Singles play was no different, as each player
was victorious. The continued absence of Adams
proved no problem, as Catanzariti continued her
winning ways at ﬁrst singles.

Parbhu and Evans, at fourth and sixth singles
respectively, did not drop a game in their match-
es, each winning 6-0, 6-0. .

The dominance displayed against Providence
carried over into the following match, where
Pitt took on Villanova. Again, the Panthers took
home a 7-0 victory, this time with Adams in the
lineup who, with victories in both No. 1 singles
and doubles play, went home tied for second in
all-time wins. '

Adams tied her wins with alumna Carlie
Smith, who ﬁnished her careerwith 135 victories.
Additionally, the singles victorywasnumber 65
for Adams, putting her in third place all-time in
school history, three shy of alumna Fran Davis
for second.

While Pittlostto Seton Hall just one day later,
one of the day’s lone bright spots wasAdams, who
picked up her 136th career victory to put her in
second place for the all-time record. ’

“I knew going into the match that if I won, I
would break the record. It’s always nice to move
up in the record books, and I was really excited
when it happened,” Adams said. “Knowingthat
itwas close has really been motivating me to do
well this year.”

Borza also expressed pride in her teammate’s’ .
achievement.

“It was great to see her get the record,” she
said. “She’s been hurt this year, but I’ve seen her
win a lot of matches when I would come watch
my sister [Kristy Borza] play. It’s really cool thatl
gotta see her playforthreeyears, and nowI get to
play alongside her. Elizabeth is a great player, and?
she’s won a lot of big matches for Pitt tennis.”

The most recent Pitt match came against
Crosstown foe, Duquesne. The Panthers were
unable to assert themselves over the Dukes, as
only Evans was able to pick up a victory in sixth
singles.

Beyond that, the Panthers were unable to do
much else as the rest of the team only combined
to win two sets in singles play, and the doubles
teams lost hard-fought matches.

Now at 6-8 overall, the Panthers have six
games remaining on the schedule. The team looks

togetover.50O andmakeastrongruninthe  S

East tournament starting in late April.

The home stretch fortheteambegins Wednes-
day, with a home match against the Penguins of
Youngstown State, and matches further down
the line came against Big East tennis powers
Syracuse and Rutgers.

“We are lookingto make the tournament, and
we know we have to beat two of the top teams,”
Evans said. »

“But we are focused inpractice, and we know
what we have to do down the stretch.” l

Thinking of Quitting
Smoking? The Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh seeks
smokers aged 18-65
who are already plan-
ning to quit smoking to
participate in a 9-week
research study on the
short-term effects of
two oral medications
on smoking behavior,
craving, and mood.
One is FDA—approved
for smoking cessation,
Zyban (bupropion),
and the other is FDA-
approved for wakeful-
ness, Provigil
(modaﬁnil). This is
not a treatment study.
You will be asked to
take study medication
that may or may not
contain the active com-
ponents. Research
study participants will
be compensated. Al-
though his study is not
a treatment trial, every-

one who completes the

study will be offered
optional brief counsel-
ing and Zyban (bupro-
pion) at no cost after
the study is over to
help them quit perma-
nently. For more infor-
mation, call 412-246-
5306 or visit our web-
site at www.smok-
ingstudies.pitt.edu
