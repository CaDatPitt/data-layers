Tuition remission beneﬁts--free
and lowered tuition for Pitt's staff
members and their families--will
face a difﬁcult test in the state
legislature soon and may be
discontinued as a result of a
measure brewing in the general
assembly, Chancellor Wesley W.
Posvar warned at Monday’s Senate
Council meeting.

“Action probably won't be ﬁnal
next year,” Posvar said, “but in
the future, we can expect the
legislature to try to stop the
program.”

Posvar. said the assembly’s
feeling against the tuition remis-
sion program was another mani-

News analysis

izr GENE GRABOWSKI

It seems inevitable that the
tuition remission programs of Pitt
and other state-owned and state-
related schools will be ended with
legislation by the fall of 1976.

Members of the general as-
sembly, consumed‘ with new fervor
_to eliminate what they consider a
waste of tax dollars and prevent the
spiraling costs of education from
hiking the ' state's budget any
further, are striking out against a

program once viewed as a beneﬁt

to the Commonwealth.

The tuition remission program
has come under attack especially
from those senators and represen-
tatives whose blue collar consti-
tuencies see unfair privileges
extended to the families of those

' already priveleged--college faculty.

The program, they contend,

- allows the sons and daughters of
well paid faculty members to go to '

school free, while they must pay
full price for their children to
attend the same schools.

The greatest criticism of the
program, though, comes from
legislators who -view the fringe
beneﬁt program simply as bad
management.

Representative Bill Shane, D-ln-
diana, who sponsored the original
to prevent the program's
continuation. summed up this point
of view two weeks ago:

“Whileinstitutions are pleading
for more money from taxpayers,”
Shane said. “they're losing $3
million to $5 million annually under
free tuition programs." _

Pitt Chancellor Wesley W.
Posvar has defended the ‘tuition

/.. ., /- --v...

festation of legislators’ resentment
and misunderstanding toward pro-
fessional faculty members.

“The legislators are taxpayers
who perceive well-heeled profess-
ors reaping beneﬁts from the
program," Posvar said, “while
they see their blue collar consti-
tuents supporting the free educa-
tion.”

Posvar . said he found the
program to be morally and socially
progressive, benefiting mostly
secretaries and clerical employees
of the University. .

Additionally, Posvar labeled the
program “a very efﬁcient fringe
beneﬁt” in terms of its cost to the
University and value to employees.

“The tuition remission beneﬁt
has a very low cost of dollars to us,
and it’s a tax shelter,” said Posvar.
‘‘It also provides our workers with
the opportunity to better them-
selves.

The measure to limit the tuition
remission programs of all state-
owned and state-afﬁliated colleges
and universities was introduced
late in May by State Representative
Bill Shane, D-Indiana. It has
passed in the House 193-2, and if
passed by the Senate and sup-
ported by the governor, it will take
effect September 1, 1976.

The Governor’s‘ Management
Review Teams, which studied
Pitt's budget problems in 1974 and

1975, have suggested the elimina-

remission program as a “morally
and ‘socially progressive” one.

Posvar has noted that the,
program beneﬁts clerical workers
and non-professional employees to
a greater extent than it does faculty
members. ~

The families of blue collar
workers, according to Posvar,
actually gain as much by the
program as the families of faculty
members. '

for the loss of the beneﬁt would

What of the economic "attack,

taxpayers’ money by supporting H

had admitted they work here at Pitt
primarily because of the tuition
remission plan.

Pitt administrators “won’t help the
students any,” and that the real

. thrust of the unionization question

is what students and faculty could
do in terms- of lobbying in
Harrisburg for increased funding.

Van Beck Hall, a representative
for the Pitt Professional Union
(PPU) said student representation
at negotiations already has been
included in some union contracts in
the nation.

“We would probably sympathize
with some form of student
representation,” Hall said. “I
think they have a similar arrange-
ment at the University _of Cincin-
nati.”

Hannan said there is a possibility

Paper Strike Sparking
Rush on Reading Matter 1 

BY BOB MAYO
Oakland residents are rapidly,
ﬁnding replacements for their

missing city newspapers as the
Teamsters’ strike against The
Pittsburgh Press Company enters
its third week.

“People just grab anything they

can get,” said a saleswoman at the
magazine stand in the lobby of the
Webster Hall Hotel.

According to Tony DiPallo, a
security guard at the Forbes
Avenue Sun Drug Store, all but
eight of 120 copies of TV Guide
were sold in two days. DiPal1o
indicated this was a ‘substantial
increase in sales.

Sales for the TV magazine
doubled at Gus Miller"s, an

- Oakland magazine store.

“We’re selling two times as
many copies of the Pittsburgh

Roots is a magnificent pair of shoes. Beautifully made. And very likely the
most luxurious pair of anything your feet have ever experienced. Now we’re

price. Sale ends July 31, or when we run out of this special group.

“Be kind to feet. They outnumber people two to one.”

 
     

Courier, and sales are up 50% -for
the Pittsburgh Forum, said the
clerk at Miller’s., “People are
buying magazines like crazy.” »

There has been a great demand _
for the New York Times in the " :
Oakland area. 

“Distributors won’t give us any i
more than the normal amount of 
the New York Times. The line of
people goes up around the corner
on Sunday," said the clerk at

Miller's. Everything is doing ‘
increasingly well, esp.eciallyIff/ 
books." 

The newspaper vending stand
has been doing good business,
selling out of town papers, ,
including the Philadelphia Inquir- --2
er, and the New York Daily News. ’ ,

People have been reserving :2
copies of the New York Times and  j
TV Guide at Cathedral Pharmacy ' /‘
on Fifth and Neville Avenues. s
“We sold out of TV Guide before 6'
noon (the day it arrived),” said
Antoinette Trageser of the Phar--'-—-v_j_:‘
macy. L  

Trageser also expressed concern 
that Pittsburghers would grow
used to not reading the local papers
and that the papers’ circulation
would suffer because of this.

The strike by Teamsters Local _.
211, which has halted publication 1
of the Pittsburgh Press and the _ Q
Pittsburgh Post Gazette, which is 1' ‘
printed at the Press’ facilities
under contract, still awaits further
action ill the courts.

The Press sought a’temporary
injunction against the strike before
US District Court Judge Barron
McCune last Wednesday. When
McCune denied the request, the.
Press moved to appeal the ruling in
the Circuit Court at Philadelphia-
Thursday, but no date has been set
for that hearing.

Some council members asked
how the state would prevent the
University from providing a tuition
remission program, but Posvar
brought the discussion of the
matter to a close by saying he could
not answer the questions satisfac-

}j“‘grily at an open meeting.

“If we were in a closed door
meeting, I could answer all of these
questions more fully and complet-
ely,” said Posvar, “but if -we were
to make the complete answers a
matter of public record, we could
hurt the University's case.”

Previously, Posvar said he
favored a low key approach to the
matter, providing for quiet logical
argumentation instead of creating a
political uproar.

The Chancellor said “loopholes”
may be closed by the legislature if
the issue is inﬂamed.

The Chancellor also reported
Pitt’s state aid package is out of the
‘possibly
could be passed as late as
September because of the assem-
bly’s August recess. He assured
the Council, however, that there is
no worry about time in the matter,
since he was certain of the bill’s
passage.

Posvar brought the Council up to
date on the continuing rfaculty
unionization hearings, reporting on
the decision by bargaining units
and the University to allow Pitt’s
125 department chairmen to vote
“on challenge” in the event of. a
collective bargaining vote.

Under the ruling, Posvar said,
the votes .of the department
chairmen will be counted only if

ﬁ§.'7{‘“~‘g:,;._enough of them vote to sway the

I

outcome of the issue’, either for or

‘ against unionization.

Platt presented the Council with
a position paper requesting the
organization of a blue ribbon
committee to study student teach-
ing evaluation.

The committee, according to
Platt, would be charged to examine

- culty attitudes toward evaluation,

 - -lore ' the

 

 

value of student

evaluation in aiding tenure deci-

sions, and study the feasibility of

University-wide evaluations.
Platt's request was challenged

by several Council members who. i’

although they admitted the study
would be a good idea, were wary of
charging a committee immediately,
while its goals were incomplete.

Platt, apparently disappointed
by the postponement, said he was
agreeable to putting the motion to
create the committee in any form
acceptable to the Council as long as
it would spur immediate action.

“Let's get going," Platt urged.
“Let’s not wait another month and
get bogged down."

Council members Richard
Tobias, Cyril Fox and John
Armstrong questioned the wisdom
of rushing the proposal to a. vote
while it was incomplete. ’ _

Vice-Chancellor of Planning and
Budget Jack Freeman offered the
solution to the impasse that was
ﬁnally accepted. ~

“The initial study of student
teaching evaluation is a technical
kind of question," Freeman said,
“The office of research and

 

evaluation could tackle the problem
of researching the available find-
ings and offering the data to the
commission when it is charged."
_ The Senate Council agreed to
implement Freeman's plan as soon
as possible.

SG member Mary Schwarz
reported on the shortage of
dormitory living space for students
next year. causing Vice-Chancellor
of Business and Finance Joseph
Dutton to speculate on the housing
problem next fall.

“As it stands now, about 50
students have no place to live in the
fall,” said Dutton. “At most, 10 or
15 still won't have a dorm by the
time the term begins."

Dutton explained that every fall
about 70 Pitt students don't show
up for their room assignments.
Even if fewer “noshows” occur
this year, according to Dutton, a
few students could be stuck without
housing.

The Council passed three related.

resolutions at its meeting. The
first, calling for participation by
authorized faculty and students in

the University's budget process,

A newly expanded parking lot on Forbes Avenue is now open to the
public 24 hours a day. Its entrances on Forbes and Halket Streets have

automatic gates and ticket dispensers.

The rates are reportedly

A -I The question of ‘students sitting in at the faculty unionization
hearings is one that rests once again on the students’ right to know.

By law, either party in the negotiations, labor or management, can
' ‘bar any third group from the conference room. The decision to oﬁer

any degree of observer status therefore will depend upon the good

_ graces of the Pitt faculty and administration.

 Though some may contend the presence of students will imperil the
‘course of negotiations, little realistically can be demonstrated to
support this. ‘No one can expect the student body to play a major role In
the union talks since the union is of primary importance to the faculty
and only of secondary importance to students.

 One fact is essential, however, and that is that the union, if there is
_ to be one, potentially can affect education at Pitt, and it is this
 potentiality of which students must be ever mindful.

 There is nothing in the basic relationship between student and ‘
jteaclierthatsetsorieolffagainsttheother. Quitetothecontrary, it
 shouldbethedesireofevery studenttosee tluit instructors are paid

jjustly for their time and sharing. But the phenomenon of the labor
*‘ union to solve pay disputes has been a ﬁery issue throughout worker

 history.

Especially in the case of labor that involves performing a service
rather than manufacturing a product, there is a third party that is too
often disregarded in the negotiating process. ‘ The current state

 employees’ strike is a prime example of the service lost to 'a large
‘number of people not even a party to the strike. It is often this loss of
I service and the resulting chaos that comes to serve as the main issue in
such strikes, overshadowing the real reasons why the workers chose to

7: walk out.

"The teachers’ strike at Robert Morris College last term often was

, ' heralded by anti-unionists as the wave of the future if Pitt's faculty
, ‘chose to go union. Observers can only speculate at this time as to the
full effect a teachers’ union would have on Pitt’s quality of education.

 _- In deciding whether or not to accept a union, both parties must
  their labors consist of the shaping of minds and the cultivating
7* -of talents. The university is not an assembly line whose goal is to turn

p out as many new models a year as it can.

It is for this reason that faculty and administrators must approach
V . the union issue with the utmost candor and good judgment. Including
" students as observers could serve only to increase the many viewpoints

, BY PETE BUTCH

,And so it came to pass that in the
decade of the Twentieth Century
called the Sixties the people of the
land between two oceans, America,
‘j » ﬁnally became appalled at what Big

"3 Business had done to their land and
to their planet.

So they rallied around people
like Ralph Nader and others who
had the best interests and safety of
the people and the environment in
mind. The people put forth a great
lobbying effort in Congress, which
then enacted legislation requiring
steel mills, power plants and
automobiles to be cleaner and not
, pollute the environment. Legisla-

‘ I tion that required automobiles to
be sturdier, and not receive great
damage at the slightest bump.

   
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
 
  
  

Big Business put forth its token
« protest. but remained silent for a
 few years. And the people, feeling
 they had total victory, went back to
being just people.

What the people hadn't noticed
was that Big Business was slowly
but surely passing the cost of these
controls onto them instead of
absorbing them in its fat» profit
margins. ‘

When the economy took a turn

that are needed as input for the best decision.

- Even if they extend observer status only to the heads of the three

student governments. both sides will beneﬁt from the availability of
responsible student opinion to supplement testimony if need be and
indicate how a union could affect students and their learning. After all,
unlike General Motors, a university cannot recall its products for

people noticed how much automo-
biles, steel and power increased in
price Big Business made its move.

Reminding the people how
AMERICAN it was to be Big
Business, it went on to claim that
people like Ralph Nader were not
acting in the best interest of
America. Moreover. the rules they
passed were so strict they were
downright undemocratic.

How undemocratic were the
rules? Well, they were so bad that
Big Business made less money.
And to prove this, Big Steel began
shutting down mills they claimed
were losing money.

But, most importnat, Big Steel
promised to reopen the mills if the
EPA would take back all it said and
did. Then, Big Steel could make
money.

Normal people would call an
action like this--laying off thou-
sands of common workers until
Big Steel can get its way--black
-mail. To Big Steel it is just
common sense--one more way it’s
involved.

More and more Big Businesses
began to blackmail the EPA. But
the people--instead of naturally
being infuriated--swallowed the
Big Business stories hook, line and
sinker.

77? Sleep Through Freedom

On the evening of November 27,
‘ 1974, a group of Vladimir district
KGB (secret police) conducted a
search in the apartment of Vladimir
Osipov. Without his knowledge or
consent. papers, letters and jour-
gnals were confiscated, along with
his typewriter. The next morning,
Osipov was arrested and charged
with publication and circulation of
“illegal" materials. '

Valentina Mashkova, Vladimir
Osipov’s wife, was informed of his
arrest the following day and also
brought in for questioning as a
witness. -

Why was Vladimir N. Osipov
arrested? Until that morning, he
had been the editor of two
“samizdat” (self-publishing) jour-
nals, “Beche” and “Zemlya” and
had contributed his own articles as
well as those of other writers. He
had just mailed a letter to Senator
Henry M- Jackson in which he
appealed for help for several
arrested friends. Osipov also
frequently wrote to Amnesty
International protesting harsh
treatment of political prisoners in
the USSR.

This is not the first such arrest
for Vladimir Osipov. While still a
university student, he was arrested
in 1961 and sentenced to seven
years in-a labor camp for political
prisoners for similar publishing
activities.

Ruffian’s last stand

After his release in 1968, Osipov
and Mashkova settled in the
Vladimir district. Because both
people have been former camp
inmates, they are not allowed to
live in larger areas of the country.
Mashkova, for whom our group is
named, had been imprisoned for
ten years and after this second
arrest of her husband‘, has been
continually harrassed by the local
KGB. In our first appeal, we
discussed her terrible living condi-
tions. Now, without her husband,
Mashkova has had her second child
and is still in grave danger.

Where is Vladimir Osipov? He is
at this present time incarcerated_ at
the infamous Serbsky Institute for
Forensic Psychiatry. This is in
reality a psychiatric prison where
political dissidents are forced to
live among the truly criminal
insane and are forcibly given
physically and mentally crippling
drugs. They also are beaten,
questioned continually,'and cut off
from the entire outside world.

What can we do to help this man
and his wife? The Concerned
People for Mashkova does need
financial help, but more than that,
we want people who are equally
as concerned about Osipov’s
immediate condition. The Am-
nesty International groups

throughout the world have methods ,

for letter writing and their constant
appeals and publicity /do not go
unheeded.

Another Sport Tarnished I  

BY GEORGE W. DULL

Ruffian’s unthinkable tragedy
at Belmont Park possibly may point
to more dysfunction of the modern
situation ethic--all that matters is
winning; achieve the end and don't
worry about the means by which
you ‘do it. How, in a classic
thoroughbred race such as the
Belmont Stakes, the third.
competition of the Triple Crown, a
horse can win" with no competition
other than his jockey, requires a
hell-of-a-lot of explaining. Default?
Bull! Foolish Pleasure, another
great horse, did not win the
Belmont Stakes--no how!

  Big Business Sets Up EPA  

vania city between three rivers. In
the old days, when people cared
about ecology, they asked the EPA
for a way to clean the air in the city.

the EPA replied by pointing out.

that too many cars went into the
city. It said the amount of cars
entering the city must be reduced.
Eventually no cars at all would
enter the Golden Triangle.

Not one citizen of the area
protested when the EPA said a rule
would go into effect in a few years
that would limit certain expressway
ramps to carpools and buses.

But when the time came the
people became furious. They
believed EPA to be the dubious
organization Big Business said it
was. The people felt the EPA
infringed on their right to drive,
even though in Pennsylvania
driving is a privilege, not a right.
Being typically American, they felt
minor self-sacriﬁce was for the
next guy, not them.

Is there a moral to this, story?
Not yet. Not while. Congress and

the President are preparing two I

different solutions to the Energy
situation--both beneficial to Big
‘Oil. Not while the people judge the
solutions by who is presenting
them--not by their worth.

No, there will be no solution until
the people's say in government is
bigger than -that of Big Business.

One can probably surmise there

is as much decadence in thorough- ,

bred racing as there is in every
other so-called professional sport.
They’ve all become rackets. The
baseball, football and hockey teams
have their stadiums built at the
expense of the taxpayers. Players,
like oilwells, now rate a depletion
allowance for their owners, provid-
ing these latterday slavers with tax
privileges and loopholes. And
there -probably hasn’t been an
honest boxing match since Joe
-Louis retired. The real tragedy of
Belmont Park is that thoroughbred
flat racing may have become
another ripoff. If so, the situation
is typical of the era.

-‘Watching Ruffian sustain her
shocking injury, seeing the ﬂop-
ping evidence of a bad fracture in
the TV slow-motion reruns, and
learning with the morning news
that his proud, spirited animal had
been destroyed led me through the
human trailway of heartbroken
grief, frustration and aggression. I
wanted to scream and strike. I
didn’t. I went to the book store and
harassed those poor souls because
they didn't have a copy of Edward
Wilson’s book on sociology. I
bought my six-year-old godson an

excellent picture book on sexuality. -

His gift for Commencement 1, from
kindergarten. And if I had met a
jockey, I’d probably have kicked
“him in the ass for good measure.
The bloody shrinks tell us now
that emotional reaction is taboo,
little short of pathos. I think those
who indulge in this sort of
foolishness are full of shit; that's a
purely personal opinion I wouldn't

Maybe we Americans have
become, like Machiavelli, totally
amoral. The Belmont victory of one
unchallenged horse indicates this.
Had the owner of Foolish Pleasure

Racing silks are badges of honor.
Like Machiavelli, he cannot recog-

you, Ruffian’s injury was unique,
but accidents arenot. Therefore I
cannot help but harbor a suspieian
as to whether Ruffian’s injury was
an accident by design. Was the
race thrown?

This is a matter for the American

Thoroughbred Racing Association‘,

to investigate. I think the jockey
should be barred from further_

settled. There are, in the news

Israelis Charged
With Repression

In your May 29 issue. Jerry Leff

I , attempts to discredit efforts of the

aalestine Solidarity Committee by
asserting several points re. the
history of the Palestine Conflict
which have since been abandoned
even by the most zealous Israeli
apologists. He asserts: (1)
Palestinians left their country in
1947-48 voluntarily at the behest of
Arab propaganda; (2) Israel is
doing nothing to erase the national

character and independence of tI"°=

Palestinian Arabs; (3) the PLC- 
not representative of the Palestin-
ians; (4) the Arab states are
responsible for the refugee prob-
Iem; and (5) there are no political
prisoners persecuted in Israel.
merely terrorists justly incarcer-
ated.

:7; Space may be inadequate to
answer all these gratuitous asser-
tions, but allow me to at least
begin. The first assertion
manifests the ignorance of Leff of
Zionist writings on this point. '1
refer him to M. Begin’s, The
Revolt; Arthur Koestler-’s, Exodus;
The New York Times of April 12
and 13, 1948; and the New York
Herald Tribune.of April 12 and 13,
1948. These sources all attest to
the _systematic, planned violence
and atrocities perpetrated by the
Jewish terrorist groups-the Irgun,
The Palmach, The Stern Gang--as

well as the Jewish Agency, in order

to forcibly expel and panic the
Palestinian villagers and farmers.
Thus, the Zionists then moved in to
occupy the various towns them-
selves. In this manner at least 19
villages and towns were seized by
Jewish terrorists and military
forces before May 15, .1948! Up to
this time, no military forces of
neighboring Arab States had yet
even entered the battle!

Leff has preferred to believe
Zionist propaganda that Palestin-
ians in Israel enjoy political
independence. I again refer him to
the very detailed statement and
presentation by Dr. Israel Shanak.
and Israeli scientist and Chairman
of the Israeli League for Human
and Civil Rights. In addition to his
writings. he testified on April 4,,
1974. before the US House
Subcommittee on International
Organizations and Movements, on
the brutal campaign of Israel to
make the Arab presence disappear
within Israel. According to Dr.
Shahak. of the 475 Arab villages in
Palestine before 1948, more than
385 have been completely destroy-
ed‘ by the Israeli Government to
make way for stricktly Jewish
settlements.

Is Leff aware of the Emergency

Defense Regulations in Israel_

which apply only to Arabs?

Through this “legal’_’ structure,
Palestinian Arabs live under
martial law; are denied equal pay
for equal work; their freedom to
move and purchase land is

the International Red Cross can

than 65.000 Palestinians from the

The PLO is rejected by Israel as

Palestinians can express their

You can do it, too. So far over 550,000 other people have done it. People who
have different jobs, different I05, different interests, different educations have

people have all taken a course developed by Evelyn Wood, a prominent

better comprehension. Most have increased it even more.
Think for a moment what that means. All of them—even the slowest—-now read
an average novel in less than "two hours. They read an entire issue of Time or
Newsweek in 35 minutes. They don't skip or skim. They read every word. They
use no machines. Instead, they let the material they're reading determine how
fast they read. And mark this well: they actually understand more, remember
v more, and enjoy more than when they read" slowly. Thatfs right! They

The black hole theory, originally
proposed to account for the lost
mass of the universe, has been
proven recently through the sight-
ing of intensely radioactive ‘areas in
the galaxy.

Apparently, mass is sucked into
the black hole by its overwhelming
gravitational field to disappear
completely. Where does it go?

“The Archive Project” suggests
there may be doorways to other
universes--altemate realms of exis-
tence--and proceeds to take you
there.

The visual slides and special
effects are combinations of those
prepared on the East Coast and

cowboys. Its concept of Western
storytelling (and the perils of the
Daltons) was a collaboration of
Jackson, the Eagles and J .D.
Souther. Musically, it was as tight
as the girth could be pulled, and
the songs fit together as well as a
good_ wood frame--without nails,
glue or wire...

On The Border was a relaxation
lp. It was time to enjoy commercial
success, and “Already Gone” and
“Best Of My Love” made it quite

‘ enjoyable. I

And now we have a perspective
for the Eagles’ newest--‘_‘One of
These Nights,” deﬁnitely their
most easily accessible album.
Accessible because of the listen-
ability. Some lp’s make it difﬁcult
to get past the opening track
(“Tonight’s The Night,” case in
point--that later), and others have
the right combination of lyrics,
melody and rhythm to make them a
commercial success. That is not to
say that the album is flawed, by
any means. In some cases,
commercialism may be a drawback
to a band’s creativity. In this case
we have an album that will sell like
hotcakes and get recognition from
many critics as the Eagles’ best.
Wrong.

There are a few really good
tunes--“Take It To The Limit,” “I
Wish You Peace” and “Journey of
the Sorcerer”--that I believe made
the lp for this reason: these songs
are the most unrepresentative and
yet at the same time most like the
Eagles.

“Journey of the Sorcerer” is a

In 45 minutes you learn about 11

letdown: the absolute meeting
between galactic explorers and
super-intelligence from beyond the
universe is not quite as splendifer-
ous as it could have been.

Of course, there are ‘limits, and

the rest of the show seems to make 1

up. for it in a lot of ways.

Paul J. Oles, Buhl’s program
director, was at the control panel
during the show. It was a one man
job and Oles directed more than 45
dials and many more switches to
create the optical effects of “The
Archive Project.”

There are plans ‘to computerize
the control of I the projection

complex, but right now it’s two"

hands and two eyes versus an
incredible array of electronics.
But the training shows; there is
never a trace of hesistancy or of
hasty movements during the
production of “The Archive Pro-
ject.”
Oles is cooking up another sci-fi
tasty for Pittsburghers next sum-
mer, once again combining typi-
cally dry sky lecture material with
the imagination and" vision of
speculative fiction by the best in
the field.

“It’s an interesting diversion
from the usual stuff. fWe’re
packing them in to ‘The Archive
Project’; it’s even better than our"
showing of ‘The Last Question’ last
summer,” Oles said.

Buhl is considering producing its‘-’
own multi-media piece on a science
fiction theme. Oles is working with
members of Pittsburgh’s sci-fi
community on possibilities such as
the “9 Billion Names of God,” by ’
Isaac Asimov, “Neutron Star,” by
Larry Niven (the latest and
brightest of the recent sci-fi
authors), “Night Fall” by Arthur
Clarke and “First Contact” by
Leister Murray. -

Meanwhile, Pittsburgh people
with a taste for the inﬁnite can
barrel out between, the universes in
“the Archive Project,” running
until September 1, Monday and‘
Tuesday at 2:15 pm and Wednes-
days through Fridays at 2:15 an
8:15 pm. ‘

There are three showings on
Saturdays and on Sundays. Grab

lRo||erbo||’: All-Americcin Fun 

BY M.C. PILECKI ‘

Hallelujah for Hollywood.

It's certainly nice to see the
old-fashioned, expensive movies
back on the wide screen. It's the
stuff that makesit all worth buying
popcorn. _

And not all the_ corn is covered
with butter.

Although not exactly in the old
tradition, Rollerball is deﬁnitely a
wide screen spectacle, with a plot

7 that doesn’t matter and characteri-

zations that would look ridiculous
on the daytime soaps. But there’s
action, and plenty of it.

Rollerball is a science fiction
yarn about yet another way that
-society (aswe know it) will die.
This time it’s the corporations that

take over theworld. And as usual, ..

mostof the human problems of war,
hunger, poverty, etc., are gone,
and the people live in a leisure
society.

One of the principal forms oi
entertainment is a new, not overly
original sport called--you guessed
it--rollerball. The game seems to

be set up pretty much like the pro.

sports we all know and love, except
that rule changes often come
swiftly, without notice, from above.

Rollerball is a combination
principally of roller derby and
hockey (those being probably the
most violent games, short of
dueling, these days). But rollerball
makes those two sports look like
mah jong. Injuries are widespread
and death is common in rollerball.

Question: since the sport is so
bloody violent and the rewards so
few [it was designed “to show the
futility of individual effort”], why
would anyone want to play it?
That’s just one of the things that
does not make much sense. I

But no matter. The plot--thin as
it is--has very’ little to do with the
main appeal of Rollerball: some
very rough, action-ﬁlled game
scenes. The photography would do
credit to ,ABC’s Wide World of
Sports, and is so absorbing that one

Norman Jewison’s newest film,
Rollerball, playing in downtown
Pittsburgh.

gent in the‘ audience began to root
for "the Houston team (Houston is
the team " for which James
Caan--our hero--plays).

That’s all the film really is: three
game sequences strung together by
sticky dialogue. Director Norman
Jewison seems much more at home
with action movies [although he
still has a tendency to overuse the
close-up], and some day he could
well direct TV coverage for the
Super Bowl.

Caan is passable as the big,
dumb jock whounwittingly foils

.‘ .‘: 1.

The System by not getting killed
and--worse yet--by getting down-
right popular in the game. -John
Houseman, the not-so-good-guy
executive (boo and hiss , here,
please), is just not villainous
enough to make a good villain.

He’s not ,really much of .»a
malefactor--not because"’"of. his
performance, but because of his ,
role structure. ‘ ’

The costumes are not overdone--
fortunately--but some of the
‘makeup is just a shade short of
ghostly. To show the degeneracy-_
of the population, one supposes.

The sets are a little futuristic,
which is_expected from sci-fi but
too often overwrought. ‘

But who really will notice any of
this while watching Rollerball? It
would be-like going to a football
game to watch the halftime show.
You go for the blood and guts--not
for the frills.

The Wind and the -Lion has
plenty of frills, though. This.is one
,spoof those “real” wide,screen

. epics that would have been right at .

home 20 years ago. It’s still good,
solid enough escapism, with a cast
of thousands, dazzling scenery and
the aura of the turn of the century
to boot.

The plot, such as it is, concerns a
Berber (Sean Connery) who goes‘
rampaging through Morocco and
kidnaps an American lady (Candice

L:

Bergen) and her children,‘ just to
prove a point. He doesn’t like the
European influence in his country.

cans. ‘

and needs a handle for his

The movie covers the turmoil in
the two countries and emphasizes
the characters of the Pirate and the
President. who are shown as very
similar persons. Except for the
understandable cultural differ-
ences. the two are practically
identical as charismatic leaders of
adoring peoples. loving the land

__and its heritage, with God (or
Allah) at their respective sides.

Bergen is the real throwback to
1948 adventure yarns as the
American lady who brooks no truck
from her captors, retaining the stiff
upper lip and all that in regard to
honor, truth. good faith and the

Dismal--showing or causing
gloom or depression.

The above dictionary definition
fits the exact mood in recent years
for Army football. In fact, since the
late 50’s and early 60's, the West
Point Academy hasn’t played with
the ﬂair or greatness typical of
early teams. Armyphas been a
has-been. ' "

Despite a 3-8 record last year,
“new" was the word to describe
the Army program. I-Iomer Smith
was the “new" head honcho after
having been an assistant
Pepper Rodgers at UCLA.

With an entirely new coaching
staff to go along with a new
offensive punch_ (the wishbone
replacing the I-formation), plus a
new defense, winning three games
might be considered a big
accomplishment.

Smith seems to have experienced
players this year to better his initial
year. Twenty-six lettermen are
returning, including seven starters
on offense and six on defense.

This year's Plebes appear to be a
stronger and quicker team but with
the same problem attributed to
every Academy team--lack of
depth. . .

The offensive backﬁeld should
prove to be one of the\ definite
strong points. Senior co-captain
Scott Gillogly will return at
quarterback, the position he held
for most of last season. —He is rated
the quickest runner on the squad, a
plus in running the option play.

Leamon Hall, who ran the
offense the last four games of last

‘season, also will be back. He is the

thrower of the two, and since Army
averaged only 74 yards passing in
11 games-last season, he will be
relied upon heavily.

The top two runners for Army
last season, fullback Brad Dodrill
and halfback Markus Hardy, are
returning. Dodrillgalloped for 558

ci.....g

‘ campaign and

for

.~r

'    July =1-6,»

e in th
yards \vli_ile Hardy added 495; both
averaged better than four yards per
carry.

The remaining halfback spot is
up for grabs. with sophomore Greg
King. junion Tony Pyne and senior
Kevin Christensen vying for the
position.

At the receiving, end, there will
be a group of new faces. Greg
McGlasker, a quarterback for the
past two seasons, has been
switched to split end for the fall
is currently the
prime candidate, ahead of Gary
Smithey and Don Briggs.

At tight end, lettermen Howie
Williams and Jeff Jancek will battle
each other for a starting position.
Jancek was the leading receiver
last- year with 13 catches. while
Williams hadpll at split end.
Another" end. Tony Dailey, has
been moved to offensive guard and
is expected to be a starter.

The offensive line isn't exactly
the biggest in the country. but for
the first time in a while it isn't
jockey size.

At tackle, seniors Ken Liepold
(235), John Gallagher (235) and
junior Brett Moritz (260) are the
most likely to succeed, while at
guard the chief prospects are Tony

Dailey (205), Tim Felt (215), Jim .

Hodge (228) and Curt Downs (230).
Senior Ietterman Jerry Araneo is
the number one man for the center
slot, but senior Bob McClure has
been “agressive” in spring drills."
According to Coa'ch smith,’
defense is going to carry the most
weight this year. It will be called
upon “to play above and beyond
the normal as often as possible.”
Three of ﬁve starters must be
replaced up front--end, tackle and
middle guard. The two returnees,
Stan Ford and Mark Smith, were
starters last year at end and tackle
respectively, so at least there is a
bare foundation with which to
work. ’ _
Coach Smith was very pleased
with the progress, made 1 defense
