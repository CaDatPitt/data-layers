""Nine.ty-nine per cent of Pitt coeds are virgins, according to a recent
Pitt News survey carried out among dorm residents and commuters.
The same survey showed that only one per cent of male students boast a
similar distinction.

The girls filled out their questionnaires during Parents'.lWeekend
at the father-daughter luncheon held ‘in the Schenley Cafeteria. The sur-
vey of boys’ sexual habits was conducted during fraternity initiations.

Pitt News reporter Nannette Naive (head of the survey team) said

that she felt that the atmosphere in these locations would be most con-

 ducive to the truthful and accurate completion of the questionnaires.

" “No one would lie to their daddies,” Nannette said, “and fraternity
members take a sacred oath to be truthful to their brothers.”

The survey also involved interviews coupled with investigative re-
porting by experienced Pitt News staff members. Reporters were re-
minded to double check all information and verify the truthfulness of
all statements. As a result of this demand, several staff reporters have
been lost.

Reporter Dave Greeney was rushed to Presbyterian University
Hospital after being struck by an angry coed during the investigative
; portion of an interview. Meanwhile, reporter Rick S/tooler. who accept-

has disappeared completely. Rumors are circulating among Holland
Hall residents that Stooler is being held captive in the attic of the
Nurses’ residence, but attempts to verify these accusations have been
unsuccessful.

Student reaction to the interviews revealed a great deal about the
sexual activities of campus residents. One modest coed responded
with, “It’s none of your G!?'/2"/85/s*@$ business,” while another shyly
cooed, “Room 2315, Tower D, ask for Mary, call after 5.

Crack newshawk. Rich Euler-

yesterday admitted, "Yes. I'm
Superman." '

The man of steel broke down
and confessed when a green metal
filing cabinet in the Pitt News of-
fices was revealed to be of kryp-
tonite composition. -

-Kryptonite is the single sub-
stance ’eapable of destroying the
otherwise invulnerable super hero.

Groaning and thrashing about
the floor in agony, Euler was at
first thought to be a victim of food
poisoning, having just returned
from the Tuck Shop. But when a
staff Good Samaritan proposed
the poor devil be dragged to a
swivel chair near the cabinet.
the tortured figure cracked under
the strain.

Euler, who posed as a meek.
mild-mannered, wordy Pitt News
reporter, broke out in a cold sweat
following the statement. "I should
have suspected earlier." he stat-
ed. "1 never could understand why
I always felt weak when walking
through that room.”

After being dragged to- relative
safety, the relieved hero‘ stripped
to display his uniform, only to dis-
cover its absence. “I forgot they
were in the laundry,” he explained
sheepishly. ~

“I don’t really like to wear that-

monkey suit," Euler continued.
"It’s kind of itchy and, besides.
I'd like something flashier, some-
thing more relevant to today."

"Supermanning isn’t what it
used to be." he explained. “Chang-
ing the course of mighty rivers
and bending steelin your -bare
hands gets boring after a while.

“Everybody used to make_such
a big deal about that,” he com-
plained. “Super-this and super-
that. And that TV show they used
to have! The guy didn’t resemble
me in the least,” fumed Euler,
striking a characteristically dra-
matic pose.

 

9 stu-

  

   
  

He added, “They made me out
as some kind of freak. ‘Strange
visitor fromanother planet," ba-
loney. I was. born in Walla, Walla,
Washington’:

But Euler noted that he had to
leave home at an; early age.

“There were no tall buildings
to leap over with a single bound,”
he sighed, “and I had to maintain
my press image.”

When asked if he were faster
than a speeding bullet, Euler,
grinning, quipped, "I might be
able to outrun Roy Rogers‘ dog,
considering how old he is.

“And so far as that truth, jus-
tice, and the American.way is con-
cerned; listen—I could tell you
stories that would curl your hair.
And they’re all true. Why, if I
told you what really went on in
those telephone booths—" he
broke off abruptly.

“Well, duty calls,” he stated.
“So it's up, up, and awa !” .

-Director of Secret Activities
Welby Markus astounded mem-
bers of the Seclret Affairs Advi-
sory Council by appearing at a
meeting without his moustache.

prised SAAC member.

“Yes,” Markus replied gleeful-
ly, “my wife loves me again!”

After the meeting Markus" told
the Pitt News that he had grown
the mustache in response to the
ribbing of the Dean of Secret Af-
fairs, who gave him the nick name
"Voit” because, “he says ’my
head looks like a basketball,"
Markus explained.

In an exclusive interview with
Markus,_ he revealed the real mo-
tivation behind the move. His ana-
lyst suggested that he terminate
his tonsorial growth because he
has developed a Santa Claus com-
plex.

It seems that Markus was able
to identify with Claus, because af-
ter listening to students all day,
he felt‘ like the Horne’s Santa af-
ter the afternoon shift.

Dr. Steingold of the Health Cen-
ter Psychiatric staff, said that
Markus is responding to treat-
ment after following his sugges-
tion, but is not yet completely
well.

"He still. thinks that the first
floor of the Student -Union is the
North Pole,” Steingold said, "but,
as long as no one tells that Bill
Lendahand, ‘Tom Wreckage, and
Eleanor Wash aren’t really elves,
his recovery will be complete. _

 
 

"You shaved it off,” cried a -sur-'

 

SUPERMAN: Indecent Exposure?
Euler then leaped out a Student

Union fourth floor window. Un- ,

fortunately, since the window was
closed at the time, the glass was
shattered. In addition, Euler

found himself only able to fly

straight down.

“It looks like it’s gonna be one
of those days,” he moaned.

  Shrillifications

Piccolo-clad piccoloists pickled

by ANDREW J. SNOBko

As the Month of Modern Music
draws to a close (thank God). it
is really becoming more and more
apparent that our Music Depart-
ment is becoming a center of
idiocy over this odious idiom.
This is especially. evident when
one considers the well known fact
that no musical compositions

' worth listening to have been writ-

‘ lection chosen for the group. "But i

ten since the turn of the century.

Yet our Music Department in-
sists on inflicting these gauche
concerts on us, though to a quali-
tied and cultured listener they are '
about as enjoyable as an Or-
ganic Chemistry midterm.

Witness their most recent of-

. fering, Thursday night’s ~“con-

cert” of “pop” (a distasteful
word, a vile phrase) music; high-
lighted by the startling appear-
ance of the 13 female members of __
the Schenley ParliPiccoloTheatre,
clad only intheirpiccolos. As these
piccolo players meandered through
the audience, producing those
shrill sonifications so long asso-
ciated with their instruments,»
several interesting (to say the
least) details came to light. 7

-It became evident that the se-

My Heart Belongs to Daddy,“ was

“totally without esoteric worth.

#2‘.

that the players (the picolo play— I
ers, not the audience) were in dire .

need of musical (not to mention

' moral} guidance, and finally, that _

several of the performers had not
bathed for what must have been
L several weeks. '

Though I really do notliketo be

 
  

overally critical of the horrendous
cuisine which the Music Depart-
ment has been serving us lately.
these piccolo players were like
onions'ready for sauteeing. the
music was like a ‘carrot which
needs cre'aming,and the concert
on a whole was like a boiled po-
tato that should be mashed.

After the appearance of the Pi-
ccolo Theatre the concert went
steadily downhill, if that is pos-

sible. It included a clarinet solo _

by Horace Wittgenstein of an un-
known work entitled Strawberry
Fields. The work was credited to
agroup of composers named only
as the Beatles (and who, praytell,
are they?). Instead of blowing into
the mouthpiece, the clarinetist
chose to use the opposite end, a
move which seemed justified con-
sidering the quality of the work.

The rest of’ the concert is not
worth mentioning, except for the
performance of Handel's Hallel-
ujah Chorus which concluded the
program. I doubt if I‘will ever en-
joy this work again without re-
membering the sacrilege which I
witnessed at Thursday’s.concert.

where the work was performed to _

a "rock" (in this case granite)
beat. This masterpiece was per-
formed by thePiccoloTheater and
Horace Wittgenstein, accompa-

nied bya.Moog synthesizer in a..
manner reminiscent of the sounds’

which can be .heard in the city

dump or the Chicago stockyards,‘

;'.Whoever is responsible for this
performance should be burned at

‘ the stake for-his.heresy. It should ,

be added that the audience did not
even rise (‘except those who left)

“THE'PITT<NE.WS--Wednesday, March 29. 1972 I

 

After listening to the debate between the University, the
Oakland community, and the General State Authority over the
use of the newly acquired land behind theH.il-lman Library,
the Pitt News has formulated a plan which should satisfy all
three parties. '

We suggest using the site to build a professional base-

- ball stadium.

Such a project would be of unquestionable benefit to
the State. The taxes that could be collected from the sale of
food, and entertainment taxes alone should convince the State
that the project is worth while.

The community would benefit, not only from having
the “Home of the Pirates” close by, but also from the reve-
nue that baseball fans would bring to local merchants and
restauranteurs. .

The stadium would provide employment for enterprising
youngsters and students.

The University would benefit from the project by coll-
ecting parking fees from fans using University owned lots.

The University, of course, would collect the stadium"s
profits. - ’

The stadium would help to attract athletes to the Uni-
versity without drastically increasing expenditures in the
recruiting program. It would also serve as an ideal place
_for entertaining visitors to the University.

In addition it would keep students on campus after
World Series victories instead of having them rampage
through downtown Pittsburgh, incurring the wrath of the
City Police. V

Considering the unquestionable benefits to the State, the

University, and the Oakland community, the Pitt News feels
that a professional baseball park would be the ideal solution

- , to the dilemma of how to use the land.

Sincethe Pitt News is responsible for this ingenious

lnidea, we feel that we should have the privilege of naming the
A  new stadium.

We would call it “Forbes Field” in honor of Joe Forbes,
a Pitt News contributing writer. \ ‘

The Pitt News is facing a staff
shortage of disturbing propor-
tions.

With a new editorial board just
taking ‘over and the departure of
11 Pitt News seniors, the need
for new writers is pressing.

Unfortunately, however, myths
keep many students from giving
the Pitt News a try.

Many students, we are told,
never mnsider writing for the
Pin News, because they are
afraid they will not be accepted.

To grapple with such fears, we
are printing a list of qualifica-
tions which must be-fulfilled by
a cub reporter before he will be
admitted to the staff.

A prospective reporter will be
judged by the editorial board,
(what there is of it), on five per-
formance factors. Students will
be rated on a one to six scale. A
four rating on four of the five
categories qualifies a student for
a staff position.

I. QUALITY

1. Leaps over the Cathedral of
_Learning with a single bound.

2. Must take running leap over
the Student Union.

3. Leaps to conclusions imme-
diately.

4. Unable to recognize Cathedral
of Learning.

5. Crashes into tall buildings when
attempting to jump over.

6. Would make a fine building.

II. TIMELINESS

1. Is faster than a speeding bull-
let in a vacuum.

2. Is as fast as a speeding bullet
at sea level. —

3. Not quite as fast as Roy Rog-
ers’ dog.

4. Would you believe a slow bull-
et-.7

5. Wounds self with bullet when
attempting to shoot.

6. Should shoot self with a silver
bullet.

The Pitt News needs reporters

Guvninski craves athletic supporters

By MYRON COPOUT
The University of Pittsburgh

‘will launch a major drive to “in-

volve the average working man”
in’ Pitt sports. Plans include the
televising of all home football
games in the 1972-1982 seasons,
plus the addition of extra planes
to carry fans to all away games.

“We have a fine sports program
here at .Pitt,” Athletic Director
Casimir Guvninski said, “but for
some reason no one knows about
it. Despite the extraordinary ef-
forts of our Information Director
Dean Bullick, when the average
millworker thinks of sports, he

does not think of Pitt. We want’

to turn this around.”

Guvninski first referred to the
University's plans to Astro-Turf
the Cathedral lawn. (See story

. on page nine.) “The conversion

of the Forbes-Bigelow-Fifth-
Bellefield grounds into two huge
football fields complete with
marked yardlines will serve as
a constant reminder that Pitt is
synonomous with football, and
make us the talk of the nation.”

Guvniski’s program includes :.

First — A new office for head
football coach Carl De Pantha.
In the past De Pantha has com-
plained that his recruiting ef-
forts have been severely ham-
pered by his lack of an impressive
office. “Frankly, I was ashamed
to invite people into those show-
er stalls,” he said’. On numer-
ous occasions, he used the luxur-
ious suite of Vice-
Chancellor for,Practically Every-
thing Bernard J. Kolbassi, for-
cing Mr. Kolbassi to waste oth-
erwise ‘useful working days at
Three Rivers Stadium.

The University has already,

acted favorably on’ the Vice-
Chancellor’s request to purchase
a private stadium box which Kol-
bassi will convert into an office,
thus freeing his former Cathe-
dral quarters for De Pantha.
Former head of General Studies
Student "Cabinet and now head
of his own private company Ca-
thedral Office Design ‘Unlimit-
ed Gordon Pursestrings has been
commissioned to refurbish the
office.

“Although plans are still on
the drawing board,” Pursestrings
said, “I initially envision a wall
of solid pigskin. On the wall are
autographed 8 x 10 glossies of
the nation's top football coaches.
We have one from Ara Armen-
ian inscribed , with the" glowing
tribute ‘To Carl. I only wishnwe

 

played Pitt every week.’ Also on
the wall are the unfaded photo-
graphs of Pitt’s All-Americans.”

Second—Extra’ planes to carry
Pitt sports fans to a_ll away gam-
es. Guvninski noted that in prev-
ious years space limitations of
the single chartered plane dic-
tated the rigorous elimination of
many fans anxious to go along.
“We simply had to cut some
people out,” he said. This pol-
icy resulted in many hurt feel-
ings and evidenced itself in a
lack of broad support the Uni-
versity might otherwise have en-
joyed.

With the addition of one or
even two extra. planes per game,
the University would be able to
accommodate as many coaches
and wives, administrators and
wives, trustees and wives, friends
of Pitt and wives, faculty and
wives, that wish to attend. They
want to open up to as many true
Pitt football fans as possible.
When asked about the possible
cost of such a service, Guvnin-
ski recounted a conversation he
had with the University Comp-
troller of Freebies.

"He jokingly said to me,‘What

— do you want Caz, a damn 747?’

I laughed at the time, but after
an exhaustive examination noted
that in the long run, we could
save $38.50 per guest by renting
a 747. This is not yet definite,
however.”

When a student reporter asked
if students would be included on
the guest list, Guvninski replied,
“Hell no.”

Dean Bullick added, “As de-
sirable as that might be, the ex-
pense of such a venture com-
pels us to draw the line some-
where.”

Third—The televising of all
home football games. Guvninski
announced the signing of an ex-
clusive ten-year multi-dollar
contract with the MonVal Cable
Company of Homestead. Mon
Val will telecastiall home games

into the homes of its 3,000 cus- /

tomers in the Monongahela Vall-
ey. Although declining to men-
tion the actual value of the pack-
age, Guvninski did say that the
contract ran into three figures.

Fourth— A new pressbox for
Pitt Stadium. Gordon Purses-
trings will also design a combina-
tion press-dignitaries box. “I
have not yet begun work on the
project,” he said. “I have visited
the newest professional stadiums

, in ~the'.country. I}have; been given

_a free hand and told that money

is no object. I enjoy working for
people like that.” Guvninski not-
ed that his department had want-
ed to build a new box for some
time. “Since the old one burned
down, we have no choice. Most
of the funds for the new con-
struction will be supplied by the
insurance we had the foresight
to substantially increase shortly
before the fire.” ,

Guvninski then responded to
the single written question sub-
mitted to his Information Direc-
tor."‘This writer wants to know-
all of the plans you have outlin-
ed refer 1 only to new benefits
for the University and the Ath-
letic Department. What new ideas
or benefits are you offering to

_ the athletes and the students?”

“So .will Carl,” replied a voice
from the back of the assembly.

“We do quite a bit for our ath-
letes,” the Athletic Director yell-
ed back. “On graduation day

most of them receive facsimile-~
degrees along with the other
students. I only wish we could
do. more for these fine young
men, but we just don't have the
budget.”

Metaphysical n/and puddles muddle ,/145,17/tistop/15/at/1 ma/we/5

by HUCK L. BERRY

The Bark of the Devil proved to
be worse than its bite.

The current attraction at the
Original Hot Dog Shop just does-
n’t cut the mustard. A dogged at-
tempt to arouse sympathy for the
devil, the film merely tumbles
into demagogic doggerel.

And the inane plot must be de-
scribed to be believed. The open-
ing shot focuses on Al Po (Rin Tin
Tin) digging for bones outside the
stockade of Fort Apache, when
viciously bitten by a vampire flea.
P0 is hideously transformed into
a mad dog, a rover of the country-
side, biting the rich and eating the
poor.

Returning to the stockade for a
midnight snack, Po wolfs down
the entire regiment until indiges-
tion forces him to spare Sergeant
Fleacollar (Ken L. Ration) and
his young son (Rusty Tin). De-
parting at a dog trot, Po stops in
the quaint hamlet of Dogpatch,
where he- encounters a gay blade
named Lolly Pup (Lassie) at the
local barn dance.

From here the plot sickens. Af-
ter the dance, the twosome pass
the local brothel, and on seeing a
female poodle (Kay Nine) loung-
ing seductively against a second-
story casement, break into a chor-
us of “How Much Is That Doggie
in the Window?”

Entering the house of ill repute,
the duo are _swatlled darkness.

Suddenly, light breaks—and so
does awindow, as cavalry gallop
into the room, hounding the ‘fugi-
tives.

Dramatically fleeing into the
forest, the duo stop upon realizing
that the soldiers had come as cus-
tomers, and not pursuers. Unable
to locate a fire hydrant, they
pause momentarily beneath a
nearby tree.

Relieved, Po and Pup resume
their wanderings through the for-
est for 40 days and 40 nights, sub-
sisting mainly on dog biscuits and
an occasional spot of tea. (Get it?
SPOT of tea? You know, like a
dog named Spot. Clever, huh? If
you think that’s good, wait’ll you
see what we pull with Oedipus
Rex.)

The scene shifts to reveal Ser-
geant Fleacollar and his young
son, who have teamed up with
wagonmaster Irving Gravy (Theo
L. D. Ranger) and his 20 mule
team “Gravy Train,” in their pur-
suit of the possessed creature P0.

“P11 find that Hell Mutt if it
kills me!” snarls Fleacollar.

He gets his initial clue at a lo-
cal Indian village and baseball
park (Cleveland Municipal Stadiu-
um). With great reservations, the
chief (Tommy Hawk) admits,
“Dog here— but dog gone.”

“Ugh!” he adds, pointing to a
pile of dung. I

Fleacollar realizes he is now
hot on Po’s tail, startled, to dis;

cover the trail leading back to
Fort Apache, recently converted
into a vacation resort.

Well, since you’ve struggled
along this far, we might as well
save you the admission charge
and finish up. Dog-tired, Fleacol-
lar and son take a room and a
bath. From the balcony, Fleacol-
lar spots Po and Pup necking by
the pool, and the homosexual
scene merely magnifies his
hatred. Grabbing a dog-eared
Bible, he hurls it at the pair.

This only serves to increase
Po’s ravin ,’. In seconds the dog-
gie duo barge into the Sergeant’s
room. Failing to fend them off
with a dog paddle, Fleacollar des-
perately wraps himself‘ around
Po’s neck. “Nevermore,” quoths
Fleacollar.

The struggle continues for 90
days, after which the demon
leaves Po, and goes to . . . (where
do you think? It sure as hell ain’t
heaven!) For his part in the
struggle, the soldier earns the
nickname Sergeant “90 Day"
Fleacollar. Po, however, is mere-
ly a shell of his former self, a
mangy flea-ridden mutt. After a
brief fling as CBS’s far west cor-
respondent, he eventually suc-
cumbs in a gutter.

Meanwhile, Fleacollar’s son
who, coincidentally, is named
Timmy, presents Pup with a col-
lie-flower. An intimate relation-
ship blossoms, and the new duo

move to the midwest to team up
with another twosome (Jeff and
Uncle Petrie), and the rest is his-
tory.

Make no bones about it, Tin is a
genuine dog star, executing his
“growls,” “barks,” and “arts”
with energetic conviction. Ration,
too, is simultaneously raunchy
and sensitive within the demand-
ing confines of his role. But the
lisping Lassie is wooden and put-
ridly prissy, while Tommy
Hawk’s performance would better
be buried.

But in the final evaluation, Ed-
die Puss wrecks (remember, you
were warned) the entire effort
with his . heavy-handed direction.
His shots of bones and gravy nev-
er mesh, and his attempt to por-
tray Po as a Snoopy figure flops
miserably.

Thelintended message is, of
course, “Every dog must have his
day," but the point is never giv-
en correct emphasis, and will
probably fly over the heads of
most viewers.

And, oh yes, the ads proclaim
that the film is “guaranteed to
move your bowels: No one admit-
ted without a diaper and doggie
bag.” It must be indeed. The the-
ater’s ushers have gone on strike,
unable to endure repeated screen-
ings of the film. “It’s worse than
Ex-Lax,” groaned one. “Whoops,
excuse me.”

In an effor_t to keep_ahead of
the latest-fashion trends the Pitt-
iful Panthers grid squad has ac-

quired, through the\ generosity-

.of the alumni,‘ a crateful of ex-

_ perimental uniforms with head-

gear.

The unifbrm, which has. been
.modeled by world famous de-
- signer Gentile Dior, is being con-

sidered for next year's Panther
attire. The uniform will be known
as the Pant suit. According to
Dior, it hasbeen designed for
any pitiful team. and the local
yokels were the most obvious
choices.

 

GENTILE DIOR

Commenting ‘ specifically on
the headgear, .Dior indicated.
"one definite advantage ‘of the
revolutionary, helmet is that it
lets the athlete blow off steam
through the unique holes.

"And besides,” he whispered

out of earshot of the lumbering _

gridders mulling around, “they

help obscure the holes that are_

already there.” ,.

‘ «'The_gridders’ inquisitive ‘Coach
Frank Mush asked, “aren’t these
helmets a hit toofjhard, I like
soft_and mushy things.”

"They’re especially designed to
protect the players’ brains,” re-
plied Gentile,~ “heaven knows
we’ve_ gotta protect what little
some of them have.”

A particular feature of the new
helmets is. the lack of a face-
guard. Besides eliminating the
pulling the faceguard penalty,
Mush has grasped upon a new
use for the innovative headgear.

“This is great,” commented
Mush. “Now we, can ‘reinstitute
the lost art of biting the oppon-

ent when he’s down. I’ve gotten A

some mouthfuls in my time,” he
reminiscedgstarry-eyed.

One egotistical Panter saun-
tered over to‘ Mr. Dior and said.‘
"Now when I smile at the crowd,
everyone can see my dimples;
They always call me Mr. Touch-
down, now they’ll know who
they’re talking about.”

But the helmets are not the
only .spec'tacu‘1ar feature of the
new -attire. The uniforms also
boast many clever features of
their own.

One of the wealthiest alumni.
Gus Fan, pointed out a few of
these advantages

»“The pants come in two styles,’
he explained. “We can~have'them

balloon out like a dress. This way '

our backs, will be able to skirt

the ends.,0r we can have them
form fitted, close to the playe_r’s
‘ ‘leg like a ballerina’s costume so

they can dance through the line.”

‘Similar to the rip-off Jerseys
used by Auburn and Alabama.
the Panthers’ new top have‘ a
rip-away feature too.

"_The difference between our

jerseys and Auburn's," continued
Gus, "is that theirs were de-_

signed to come off while ours will
prob bly rip at the seams.”

“Now that we have new uni-

A forms,” commented Mush with a

chicken leg in his hand. “Now
all we need is a few jocks to fill
them.-”

"Aren’t you going to use more

than just athletic supporters?"
queried Gus.
