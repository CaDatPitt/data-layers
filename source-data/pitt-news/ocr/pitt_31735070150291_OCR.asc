  Efforts to

a~ extend
library
hours falter

Mandy Velez
For The Pitt News

Pitt’s nocturnal studiers
shouldn’t expect an all-night li-
brary any time soon.

The Hillman Library won’t
become a 24-hour study. haven
in the near future, despite mul-
tiple student efforts to change
the current hours. Student
Government Board members
planted the seed for 24-hour li-
brary hours in 2010 under pre-
vious Academic Affairs Chair
Alex Zimmerman. Zimmerman
headed the effortsbefore pass-
ing the unﬁnished campaign
down to the next chair, Pooja
Patel, who lead a month-long
trial period of 24-hour library
operation last fall.

During the trial period, a’
security guard recorded the
number of students utilizing
the library at all hours, but the
slight increase in student activ-
ity each night last October was
not enough to make an impact.

Rush Miller, University
Library System director, ex-
plained in an email that the
Library System cannot perma-
nently change Hillman’s hours
to full-time instead of its cur-
rent schedule — 7:50 a.m. to 2
a.m. on weekdays and 7:50 a.m.
to 10 p.m. on weekends — be-
cause it doesn’t have enough
staff to work those times. '

“For our ﬁnals extended
hours, we have to shift staff
and hire more students,” Miller

Promoter brings rock history to Kimbo Gallery

   

Council. Jarrett Stewart | Senior Staff Photographer

Senior Staff Wr2'ter

For most music fans, rubbing el-
bows with rock ‘n’ roll legends like
Bob Dylan, David Gilmour and Keith
Richards would be nothing short of
a dream come true. . T ’

But for Rich Engler, it’s just an-
other day at the j ob.

This week, Engler, a local con-. -

cert promoter, shared his collec-

tion of guitars signed by the likes

of Dylan, Gilmour and other rock
heroes with Pitt students at a Kimbo
Art Gallery exhibit sponsored by
the Pitt Program Council in the Wil-
liam Pitt Union. The exhibit, which
runs from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., ends
today. B.ut'saying Engler collects

rock memorabiliais only part of the

        

story. . _

Engler, who attended Carnegie
Mellon University in the late 1960s,
said he got his start in rock-concert
promotion after ﬁnding success as
a drummer with his band, The Roy-
als. '

“People would call and say, ‘Hey,
I_ want your band,’ and I said, ‘We’re
already booked, but I have Darmya
and the Airliners if you want them.
They’re as good as we are,”’ Engler
said. ‘And I called Darmy up and
said, ‘Hey,’ I’ve got you for $500.
Give me 10 or 15 percen .”’

Engler said he soon realized that
he could earn a solid living promot-
ing concerts. The job‘ brought ~_in
around $26,000 a year — more
than he would have made with the
art degree that he was pursuing.

And in 1973, he said, Pat DiC-
esare, his primary competitor at
the time, approached him about
combining their businesses into‘
one. According to Engler, DiCesare
“didn’t want to participate in music
anymore” and instead wanted to get
involved in real estate, while Engler
handled the , L. concert-promotional
side of the business.

So that same -year, Engler and '

DiCesare formed DiCesare-Engler
Productions, and from there, En-
gler began booking concerts in
Pittsburgh and along the East Coast.
“I started booking concerts at
Three Rivers Stadium, Civic Arena, »
and then we bought Benedum Cen-
ter in Downtown, which wasknown.
as the Stanley Theater back then.’
But we sold it to the Pittsburgh Cul-

tural Trust in 1983,” Engler said.

As for his collection of rock
memorabilia, Engler said it all be-
gan one night at the Iron City Light
Amphitheatre inldowntown Pitts-
burgh in 1969. Dylan, who had re-
cently returned to performing after
a-motorcycle accident, was sched-
uled to headline a show promoted
by Engler. I

Engler said he spoke with
Dylan’s manager before the show.
Dylan’s manager told him the acci-
dent threw the folk icon into a steep
depression. Engler addedthat he
was told that Dylan was also heavily
intoxicated. V “

, Engler said it then dawned on
him that he wanted ‘a guitar auto-

said. “We can accommodate this for two
weeks, but cannot permanently run the
library_24/7 with existing staffing.”

He said that with the library open 24
hours, the library would need to hire a
three-staff—spread made up of lending
and building supervisors, plus another
security guard. Miller added that the li-
brary has looked into extending hours
for years, but he said with the economic
recession, there is no ﬁnancial support.

“We’re looking at probably $150,000
a'year to keep the library open 24/7,”
Miller said. I

ing some months the library resembles a
ghost town, while at others it ﬂourishes
with students.

“Midterms — ﬁrst week of October
and second week of November —- there

a

are lots of kids on the first ﬂoor and
ground ﬂoor,” Ott said. I
_ Today, new proponents of the hour-
extension campaign refuse to let the ini-
tiative falter, despite the opposition from
Hillman Library administration and the
inconsistency of students’ late-night li-
brary use. ,
Current SGB ‘Academic Affairs Chair
C.]. Stavrakos, who inherited the project
this year, teamed up with Vice Provost
and~Dean of Students Kathy Humphrey
to come up with a solution that will ac-
commodate everyone. SGB conducted a
survey online last semester, and at least
85 percent of students who participated
said they do their homework between
midnight and 4 a.m. ‘
“This isn’t really about hours, but it’s
providing students with space conducive
to studying,” Stavrakos said.
Humphrey and Stavrakos are still
pushing for extended hours at Hillman,

-and are also discussing using the William

Pitt Union as an alternative study space.
Stavrakos said Humphrey asked him
to look around for areas the University”-

could add comfortable furniture.

“Humphrey has the power to extend
hours here,” Stavrakos said,_referring
to the‘ William Pitt Union. “If students
were aware that’s an option, they’d uti-
lize [it] .” ‘»

All questions regarding extended
study time at Hillman sent to Humphrey
were redirected to Miller.

Alex Morgan, a senior pharmacy
student, said that she would utilize the
Union as a study space, especially on the
weekends, when the library closes early.
She said that it’s hard to study in her
apartment with her roommates there,
and she’s more likely to use _Facebook in
a no'n—academic environment.

“Sometimes, I have to _work until 8

.p.m. [on the weekend],” Morgan said.
“It’s‘annoying to have to leave [Hillman]
at 10.” U

Miller said he has tried extending
hours on the weekend, but he can’t sat-
isfy everyone. '

“I believe there are places on campus
that are [already] open 24/7 for study-
ing,” Miller said. I '

graphed by Dylan himself.

“I said, ‘Hey, would you give me one of your
guitars and sign it for me‘?”’ Engler said. “He
said, ‘Well, I didn’t bring one. But if you bring
me one, I’ll surely sign it.’ So I went down the
hall and got one.”

After he received the’ guitar, Engler said,
Dylan began strumming, but soon seemed to
lose awareness of his surroundings.

Once Dylan had trungracefully signed the
guitar, Engler said that he decided to begin
collecting guitars from different artists whose
paths he crossed through his promotional
work. He said his collection now includes gui-
tars from musicians including B.B. King, Pete
Townshend and Bo Diddley, among others.

Taylor Steffey, art director for the Pitt
Program Council, said student reaction to
the exhibit has been overwhelmingly positive
through its ﬁrst three days.

“I’ve talked to a lot of students, and they’re
very excited about it,” Steffey said. “A lot of the
directors are really excited about it, and I’ve
just heard a lot of positive comments about the
uniqueness of it.” I ‘

POINT OF CLAIRE-ITY

 unbearable because of you  

Claire Eckroate
Columnist

With its horrible lighting, garish,
bright paint on the ground ﬂoor,
Internet connection speeds com-
parable to that of a. moving gla-
cier and not enough outlets for
our laptops, the Hillman Library
is a pretty miserable place to set-
tle into for the evening.

After three years, I’ve learned
to deal with these negatives. If I

can’t plug in my computer, may- '

be I won’t stare at the blank Word
document as long. If Facebook

can’t load, it won’t distract me. V

So what continues to make my
study experience so agonizing?

It’s you.

That’s right. You.

Didn’t we all have a “library
class” in elementary school? The
one where they teach you how to
look up a book and how to read
quietly to yourself? Though we
might not be at Hillman to bor-
row the next “BoxcarlChildren”
book, the general rules of the li-
brary stay the same. The lack of
etiquette here is astounding. Be-
fore accusing me of sounding like
a grouchy librarian, hear me out.

There are too many cell phone
conversations. If I’m studying in
one of the single desks on the

fourth ﬂoor, a very quiet area of
the library, do you   ‘
you can come trudging",thi'i_’5ugh-

here on your phone, barely using
your inside voice? ‘  " ‘

“Yeah, I’m at Hillman. No,,I_’m
on the fourth ﬂoor. I have a huge
Spanish test tomorrow. -I am to-
tally screwed for it.” I

Put down the phone. Start the
studying that is so desperately

 

needed. A

While you’re at it, put your
phone on silent. I don’t need to
hear the Monday Night Football
theme ringtone every time you
get a text from your bros.

If you need to take a call,
please go somewhere else. I know
the signs say to use the stairwells,
and those echo. That’s awkward.

But the ﬁrst and ground ﬂoors ’

are ﬁlled with enough conversa-
tions that nobody would notice
another addition to the roar.

In general, keep your voices
down. Yes, the lﬁrst ﬂoor is al-
ways full of people doing group
projects or otherwise talking at
a normal volume. I understand
that there may not be enough
room - for everyone in these
chatter—friendly zones. So when
you’re displaced from the ﬁrst
ﬂoor, try to stick to whispering.

The second ﬂoor overlooks
the ﬁrst —— the noise carries. But
on the third and fourth floors,
you are completely separated
from this. The talking should
be eliminated. If, for whatever
reason, the whispering method
won’t work for‘ you, there are
other locations on campus.

Many students work better
while listening to music. Wheth-
er it’s Beethoven or Beyonce, mu-
sic can help the listener to focus.

Please make sure ‘that/your l5éa‘ts"°“
"’ ai'en’t.l bilastiriig too; loudly. Take:

out the headphones for a second:
if you stillhear therisong clearly,
it’s probably too loud. I shouldn’t
hear the whirring‘ of -Skrillex

. from three desks away.

I, like many others, prefer

having a good amount of space-

to do my work. Notebooks are

open, my laptop is out, random
papers are scattered, and there
is a pen, a pencil and a highlight-
er. But even with all of my stuff,
someone else can sit at the same
table with me.

Yes, personal space is a won-
derful thing. Hillman tends to
get crowded, so we can only ex-
tend our bubbles so far. When
-Hillman is packed on a Wednes-
day night andthere is one person
sitting at a large table, I have ab-
solutely no qualms about asking
if the other seats are taken.

If they are, ﬁne. If you say
they’re_ available, don’t look at
me like I just asked you for your
ﬁrstborn child. I see the empty
space, and I politely ask if I can
occupy it. All of us need a place
to do our homework; there is no
need to be so greedy. There’s an
added bonus of me sitting there,
too. I can watch your things
while you head downstairs for a
coffee break.

Just recently, while studying
one afternoon with a friend, I ex-
perienced the epitome of rude-
ness: what seemed like a one-
man burping contest near the
elevators. The library was pretty
empty, but that’s no excuse. We
were certainly distracted, not to
mention repulsed.

Can we all be courteous? Hill-

 v'vhe”ré’stiitTéﬁt§‘*g6‘to3 be

productive. It’s part ‘of that whole

, “college” thing we do. Think
about what would bug you while

frantically editing your paper be-
fore you go chatting it up in the
stacks. It’s what makes Hillman
mypersonal hell. I T

Carrier Dome on Friday night. Bobby Mizia | Senior Staff Photographer

Staﬁ Wrz'ter

When the Pitt football team faces Syra-
cuse Friday evening, it won’t be their fi-
nal meeting, but it will mark the last time
the teams will square off as members of
the Big East. _

Coming _off a bye week, the Panthers
(2-2, 0-1 Big East) travel to the Carrier
Dome to play the Orange (1-3, 0-0 Big
East) at 7 p.m. today on ESPN in a crucial
ﬁnal Big East matchup between the two
schools before they enter the Atlantic
Coast Conference next season.

Pitt brings a two—game winning streak
into the contest. After dropping its first
two games of the year to Youngstown
State and Cincinnati in miserable fash-
ion, ﬁrst-year head coach Paul Chryst’s
team found itself in dominating victories
over Virginia Tech and Gardner-Webb.

- Despite how impressive the1Panthers
were in those wins, Chryst recognizes
that his team can still improve.

“The bye came at a time where you
say, ‘All right, it’s an opportunity to get
better.’ It wasn’t all perfect the last two
games, so_I hope we’re getting better and

t win, Panthers set to face Syracuse

not just trying to ride that wave [of mo-
mentum],” Chryst said.
Against Syracuse, Chryst knows tl.,1,<_e".,‘

Panthers will not only need to put points

on the board, but they‘ must also focus on
limiting the effectiveness of Syracuse’s
vaunted passing game, led by senior
quarterback Ryan Nassib.

The Orange lead the Big East in to-
tal offense with 487.5 yards per game.
Syracuse’s early season offensive suc-
cess can be primarily attributed to Nas-
sib, who leads all Big East quarterbacks
with 341.8 passing yards per game and
10 touchdowns. ~

“He shows pretty good anticipationwk.

He’s confident in what he’s doing and
where he wants to go with the ball,”
Chryst said of Nassib. “He shows tough-
ness to me, and even in the end-of-the-
game situations, there is some conﬁ-
dence.”

While Syracuse leads the conference
in yards per game, the Panthers are not
far behind after the combined 90 points
and 1,163 yards Pitt’s offense tallied in
its last two contests.

BIO EAST BREAKDOWN

Rutgers, Louisvillemaintain lead as conference play kicks off 

- Dustin Gabler
Senior Staﬁ” Wrz'ter

Regular conference play in Big East football
opens this weekend with three important
matchups, starting with Pitt’s showdown
against'Syracuse on Friday night. .
While Rutgers and Louisville have looked

impressive against nonconference foes, -Big"

East play will be what decides their respec-
tive seasons. ' In past years, schools that
looked great early in the season have fallen
on hard times as they began playing fellow
Big East schools, so the Scarlet Knights and
Cardinals will hope to buck that trend.

As the race for the conference’s automat-' ’
ic bid to a BCS game gets underway, here are _

my weekly rankings of the Big East’s eight

football teams:

1. Rutgers ' ~
First-year head coach Kyle Flood’s team

» enjoyed a week off after a 4-6 start to the sea-

son. The bye week appeared well—timed for
the Scarlet Knights, after they upset Arkan-
sas on the road, allowing Rutgers to stay fo-
cused and prepare for its Big East schedule.
The No. 22 Scarlet Knights rode momen-

tum through the ﬁrst third of -their season

and need to keep that momentum going.
Look for Rutgers to be rusty early against

Connecticut this Saturday, but the defense,
which is tied for ninth nationally in points
allowed,‘ should carry the_Scarlet Knights to
another victory. ‘ t
2. Louisville

’ For the second—straight week, the No. 19
Cardinals looked uninspired against a non-
BCS squad, but Louisville still recorded the
win and improved to 5-0 with a 21-17 win at
Southern Mississippi.

The Cardinals trailed the Golden Eagles
17-6 late in the ﬁrst half, but 15 unanswered
points by Louisville were capped with a lead-
gaining touchdown with 5:35 remaining in
the game. On defense, the Cardinals didn’t
concede a second-half point, allowing for
the successful comeback. Louisville now has
two weeks to prepare for its Big East opener
at Pittsburgh. .

3. Cincinnati .

The Bearcats narrowly missed earning
a spot in the top-25 of the Associated’ Press’
weekly rankings following their 27-24 come-
from-behind victory over Virginia Tech.

.With 13 seconds remaining in the game,

FOOTBALL

Based on recent performances, Pitt
can boast a quality quarterback of its
“own in redshirt senior passer Tino Sun-
seri. Sunseri, who leads the conference
with a 166.8 quarterback rating, has also
thrown for 1,144 yards and eight touch-
downs.
After Sunseri’s impressive 27-for—34,

W344-yard and three-touchdown outing

against Gardner—Webb in Pitt’s most re-
cent game, senior wide receiver Cam
Saddler said Sunseri’s level ofconfidence
and concentration has never been high-
er.

“Tino might have more conﬁdence
than me, and that’s hard to do,” Saddler
said. “He’s ready to go every week. Even
when we were in our team meeting be-
fore we came to the stadium, we’re small
talking and whatnot, and Tino just goes,
‘Hey, let’s lock in.”’ —

Saddler ‘also added that Sunseri’s
leadership has been invaluable to the
Panthers this season.

“That’s what we need from him ~— to
be our leader,” the wide receiver said.
“He looks so conﬁdent. He’s confident
in the huddle. He’s making sure guys are
doing the right thing. That’s what We
need out of our quarterback.”

Saddler’s fellow receivers Devin Street
and Mike Shanahan have complemented
Sunseri in their own performances. In

the two wins over Virginia Tech and
Gardner—Webb, Shanahan topped 100
yards receiving — something he had
never previously accomplished in his Pitt
career — and he ranks second in the Big
East with 368 receiving yards.

With the Panthers’ offense ﬁnding
its rhythm, Pitt will need to take advan-
tage of a Syracuse defense that entered
the year expected to be one of the con-
ference’s worst units. So far, the Orange
defense has done little to dispel that no-
tion, currently‘ allowing 29 points per
game — the most among all Big East
teams. ‘

But Chryst knows the Orange will
score, too, and this game will not be as
easy’ as the Orange’s 1-3 record might in-
dicate. ’

“Looking at their record — a lot of us
want different records — but they’re a
good football team,” he said. “Our guys
know about them, and I think they are
well coached and have good players.
We’ve got to play well Friday night.”

Meanwhile, with the vital conference
game airing on national television, Syra-
cuse’s players want to show the country

that the Orange’s slow start wasan aber- .

ration.

“Friday night games are really nice
because the world is watching,” Orange
junior safety Jeremi Wilkes said. “That’s
why I like the Friday night games, be-
cause the world gets to watch and your
family at home gets to watch. It’s deﬁ-
nitely a great time.” I

‘BREAKDOWN

Offensively, the Bearcats ﬁnished with 495
yards as Legaux helped by throwing for 376
yards and adding another 27 rushing the ball.

If Cincinnati can take care of in-state rival
Miami (Ohio) and Rutgers defeats UConn,
the Big East will likely own three teams in the
top 25 next week.

4. Connecticut

The Huskies looked impressive early
against Buffalo, jumping out to a 24-7 lead in
the third quarter, but they allowed the Bulls
to ﬁght back. After surviving _a late scare,
UConn held on for the win, 24-17.

The Bulls stuffed the box and didn’t allow
Huskie rusher Lyle McCombs to beat them
on the ground. Instead, Coach Paul Pasqua-
loni turned to the air attack to get the win for
Connecticut as quarterback Chandler Whit-
mer completed 15-of-22 passes for 227 yards
and a touchdown.

UConn needs to be more balanced to put
up points against the talented Rutgers de-
fense this weekend.

5. Pittsburgh

Taking a week off, Pitt reﬂected on its

ﬁrst four games. After two embarrassing

.losses, ﬁrst-year head coach Paul Chryst’s

team rebounded and won in impressive fash-
ion against Virgina Tech and Gardner—Webb.

Pitt had two weeks to prepare for a match-
up against Syracuse, and the Panthers will
hope to extend their winning streak to three
on Friday as the two future ACC schools meet

. .5 DESIGNER SKIN”

for the last time as Big East members.
6. South Florida

The Bulls faced an uphill battle last week-
end —' one that they never really had the
chance of winning —’ as No. 4 Florida State
traveled down the state to take on South
Florida.

The Seminoles racked up 425 yards, out-
gaining USF by 157 yards in the 30-17 victory.
A 17-point third quarter sealed the deal for
Florida State.

On a three—game slide, the Bulls hope to
turn things around in the Big East when they
face Temple in Philadelphia.

7. Temple .

Last week was a popular bye week, as
the Owls were off, as well. But not much has
changed in two weeks for Temple.

After a disappointing loss a few weeks
ago to Penn State, this week’s matchup with
South Florida gives the Owls a chance at a
fresh start. In its ﬁrst conference game back
in the Big East, Temple will look for a victory
at home, but a loss has potential to start a
downward spiral, as" the Owls head on the
road in three of their next four games.

8. Syracuse

The Orange were once touted as the best
0-2 team in the country. Now 1-3, Syracuse
needs a win against Pitt if it has any desire to
rise from the bottom of the conference.

Syracuse’s talented passing attack —
ranked No. 10 nationally —— could expose

the Panthers’ secondary, but the Orange will /

need some production from their rushers to
keep Pitt from dropping seven players into
pass coverage. I
