Mark Wessel, Carnegie Mel-

III School of Public Policy and
Management, resigned Aug.
15 after it was discovered that
the school unfairly awarded a
master’s degree to an unnamed
student. .

The release of the student’s

Walters and CMU ofﬁcials

Wessel voluntarily sent his
letter of resignation Thursday,

Last winter, ateam of admin-
istrators _ from every corner of
Pittdom assembled to concoct a
way to produce a well—rounded
student both in and outside of the
classroom. After years of collabo-

ration, Dean of Students Kathy
A Humphrey says she has the an-

swer.

“If you go out there andyou
Google ‘education of the whole
student,’ you’ll ﬁnd that everybody
talks about how that’s one of their

A goals,” said Dean of Students
' Kathy Humphrey.

“[But] .we couldn’t ﬁnd any-.
thing,” she said, after attempting

to investigate how other universi-
ties were pursuing this goal. Hum-

Humphrey/’s answer: the Out-
side the Class Curriculum.

The curriculum, introduced to
the Class of 2012 this fall at fresh-
man orientation, is a four-year pro-
gram established to guide students
through anarray of extracurricular
activities to better prepare them to
enter the job market.

Barb Juliussen, associate direc-
tor of Pitt’s Career Development
Office, said that a certiﬁcate from
the program will pique the interest
of potential employers.

“They’d be very impressed,”
she said. “We intend on educating
our employers on what it means
for a student who puts this on
their resume.

“It means here’s a person who’s
gone the extra mile to prepare
themselves in a well—rounded way

to prepare themselves for the job
market,”

The Outside the Classroom
Curriculum consists of nine cat-
egories, each of which requires
the student to complete a list of
activities ranging from compos-
ing and performing instrumental

_0r vocal music, to attending a re-

ligious service of a different faith.

As students attend these events,
they will swipe their student iden-
tiﬁcation cards in newly purchased
card readers for the OCC, the
only signiﬁcant ﬁnancial cost of
the program, Humphrey said. In
addition to the suggested activi-
ties for each category, participants
rnayvalso attend events not on the
list that they feel fulﬁll the criteria
by ﬁlling out a form and providing
proof of their attendance.

About 400 pieces of furniture, which
in the past would have been abandoned
on curbsides, were mercifully spared a
landfill fate this weekend at the Oakland
Planning and Development Corp.’s furni-
ture sale.

Now in its third year, the Oakland
Furniture Sale was held Friday through
Sunday in the parking lot behind OPDC’s
headquarters on Atwood and Sennott
streets. A

This year’s sale raised a total of $6,600
on its furniture donated by local residents,
businesses and the University.

The furniture sale has come a long way
since it began in 2006 as an outgrowth of
the Dumpster Project, said Kelly Wawrze—
niak, community organizer at OPDC.
Having initiated the Dumpster Project,

.,_OPDC found that while the Dumpsters
were being utilized, they were also col-
lecting perfectly useable furniture.

To reduce waste and offer decent fur-
niture at bargain prices, OPDC started
the first sale with 150 pieces and worked
up from there.

This year, the sale was publicized by
the mayor’s office, and OPDC also adver-
tised on the Web and in local print media.
Pitt even donated some old dorm furni-
ture to this year’s sale.

“This furniture comes from every-
where,” said Wawrzemak.

OPDC started collecting the furniture
in April and offered free pick—up for all
donations. The furniture was then stored
in a donated warehouse in Lawrenceville
until the sale this month.

They also offered delivery of purchas-
es to addresses in Oakland and’ six sur-

clean of the Heinz School from February
2003 to April 2004, whereupon he be-
came the permanent dean.

Wessel’s wife, Linda Babcock, is also
a professor of economics at the Heinz
school.

The problem of the degree was
brought up to a faculty member early this
year, months before Wessel resigned and
the issue was made public.

The Friday after Wessel’s resignation,
a mass e-mail was sent to students of the
Heinz School, then a mass e-mail was
sent to all Carnegie Mellon students and
alumni informing them of the issue and
the measures being taken to remedy the
problem .and prevent it from happening
again.

“We believe it to be an isolated inci- ]

dent within the school, but we are going
to check all the students just to confirm

[that the degrees awarded in the Heinz
School in the past ﬁve years were awarded
by university standards] ,” said Walters.

.An internal committee is also going to
be assembled to assess the particular stu-
dent in dispute for a 2004 master’s degree
and status at the university.

The student’s degree is in question
because of “the approval of excessive
transfer credits and excessive units for in-

, dependent study in lieu of coursework,”

said the e-mail sent to CMU students.

“I think the Heinz School is- strong
and very resilientand will keep moving on
despite this incident,” said Walters.

Ramayya Krishnan, a professor of
management science and information
systems at Carnegie Mellon, was appoint-
ed the acting dean for the Heinz School
Monday, Aug. 18, until further action can
be taken. 0

As this is the second incidence of an
unfairly awarded degree in the region
within the past year —— the first occur-
ring at West Virginia University —— some
students have begun to question the
standards in awarding degrees in other‘
schools as well.

Rebecca DePoe, a sophomore at Pitt,

said she thinks the measures Carnegie
Mellon has taken are a good idea to pre-
vent the problem from recurring in the
future.

DePoe went on to, say that going
through such measures to correct the
problem is important because it helps re-
assert how important the academic integ-
rity of a degree is at Carnegie Mellon and
other schools in the area.

“I think that it’s important and that it
should be looked into and shouldn’t be
written off,” said DePoe.

Pitt juniors Emma Mcauly and Eric Bishop tend to the strawberries in the greenhouse above Langley Hall.

“Our biggest problem in green-
houses is that we have trouble

York also pointed’ out that
Pitt’s greenhouse facilities are
fairly small compared to the stan-

“\We’re cramming some of the
best researchers in the world into
one—ﬁfth the normal space,” said
York.

As a result, there is only space

for members of the biosciences
faculty, and even then, the green-
house bays are booked through
2010.
“I haven’t been able to do any-
thing for anyone else,” said York.

Small or not, Pitt’s greenhouse
facilities require a lot of upkeep.
Siarhei Tsymbalau, a Pitt senior,
worked in the greenhouses this
summer.

Like many students at Pitt,
Tsymbalau didn’t even know that
the University had greenhouse fa-

cilities until a short time ago.
“When I just walked in there, I
was like ‘Wowl’” said Tsymbalau.

He says a lot of his job is “just
watering and making sure that the
floor stays clean.” Tsymbalau’s
other duties include preventing
the growth of algae and fungus
in the greenhouses.

He says that he’s been working
with plants since a young age and,
although he won’t be pursuing it
as a career, ﬁnds them to be fasci-
nating.

Tsymbalau. “As a summer job it’s

plants is a full—time job.

Curriculum:
A guide to success?

Most career-minded

more to the college experience
than just academics. Success

3 boast an impressive GPA,
’ but also a notable resume of

extracurricular work. It’s one

 of being a well-rounded,
§ student. What they don’t

: the Outside

g preparation,
 skills,
' understanding

Thankfully, Pitt officials

seem to understand is how to
encourage a student to become
one.
Officials at Pitt’s Office
of Student Affairs spent the
past two years developing
the Classroom
Curriculum, a brand new
program that, with a structured
set of extracurricular activities,
aims to provide a complement
to a student’s academic
studies. The goal is to develop
a well—rounded student and
to guide him to professional
success, Dean of Students
Kathy Humphrey told The
Pitt News.

Developed from goals
established by the Office of
the Provost, the OCC program
has honorable and important
intentions, but it also has many
holes. Students who decide
to sign up for it must take
part in a certain number of
activities or events that meet
the program’s nine key areas:
leadership development, career
communication
healthy lifestyle,
diversity,
sense of self, community
participation, appreciation for
the arts and service to others.

The program does not
commit students to any single
organization where they can

; learn to work their way up

in much the same way as
they would in the real world.

zlnstead, students can fulfill

their OCC requirements by
attending various events or
lectures. And while being an
active member in a student

;organization is rewarded by
I the OCC, it’s not required.

When attending events,

like lectures, students swipe

their Pitt ID cards on a scanner
that records their attendance.
That information is then sent
to an online transcript that
keeps track of all the events
students take part in. Students
who” participate in internships
or other events not affiliated
with the University must fill
out a form detailing their
participation and submit it to
OCC volunteers who add in the
information to the students’
transcripts, Humphrey said.
Students can then print their
OCC transcripts and submit
them to employers.

The online transcript aims

to keep students organized,

but it is largely unnecessary.
Most students who actively
take part in significant
extracurricular activities
already know to include them
in their resumes.

When students complete
the program, they receive a
green cord at graduation. But
aside from that, there is no
real incentive to take part in
the OCC.

Humphrey said the
OCC partly aims to improve
the University’s student
retention rates. According to
Humphrey, Pitt’s retention
rate is 89.9, which ’means
that 89.9 percent of freshmen
graduate from the University.
Humphrey wants that rate to
be closer to 90. By committing
students to such a program,
she believes that students are
more likely to feel attached
to the Pitt community and to
stick through to graduation.

But there are other, more
efficient ways of achieving
this goal.

The reason why
students are leaving school
might have much to do with

the way Pitt’s advising process ,

is structured. Becatise advisers
meet with so many students,
they are often unable to do
much more than sign students
up for classes.
Without

Former president of Pakistan
Pervez Musharraf will never read
as an impressive ﬁgure in the an-
nals of military dictatorships,
especially when compared to his
predecessors.

The accomplishments of Na-
poleon Bonaparte, Charles de
Gaulle and Oliver Cromwell have
left an indelible mark upon their
nations and, to an extent, the Eu-
ropean community in which they
lived. Such accomplishments were
so great as to make the memory
of their transgressions against lib-
erty less painful.

Not so for Musharraf, whose
recent resignation as president of
Pakistan has been bemoaned by
so few and celebrated by so many.
From Islamabad to Washington,
everyone concerned in the last
nine years of his rule seems con-
tent to witness the end of his reign
and see power transferred to an
array of squabbling, corrupt bu-
reaucrats masquerading as demo-
crats and statesmen.

Let the politicians and pundits
rejoice, but I see no cause for cel-

ebration at the downfall of a man
whose rule might have been Paki-
stan’s last chance to extricate itself
from thousands of years of back-
ward tribalism and religion that
will, unless brutally stomped out,
forever preserve the mentality of
the Bronze Age in its citizens.

Musharraf was, I believe, a man
who could have stood ﬁrm against
the agents of religious extremism
and theocracyg a man who could
have brought tribalism to heel if
only he was given free reign to do
so.

Instead, at every turn his rule
was undermined by the lip service
that Western governments and
bourgeois Pakistanis pay to demo-
cratic values. But where have dem-
ocratic values gotten the’Pakistani
people?

Like many of the world’s de-
mocracies, Pakistan is now at the
mercy of those who the people
have elected to higher ofﬁce.

For example, let’s take a look
at Asif Ali Zardari. The widower
of former Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto, Zardari has twice been
prime minister of Pakistan and is
now a candidate for the presiden-
cy. .
Known as “Mr. 10 Percent”

because of his tendency to de-
mand 10 percent “commissions"
on government contracts, Zardari
is famous for the corrupt nature
of his political past. Oh, and he’s
now one of the two most power-
ful statesmen in the newly demo-
cratic Pakistan. i

But Zardari’s chief rival, Nawaz
Sharif, makes him look like the
poster child for successful repre-
sentative government.

Sharif is a former prime min-
ister of Pakistan and, along with
Zardari, one of the leaders who
orchestrated the resignation of

Musharraf. Reported to have ac-'
cepted a million-dollar bribe from ,

Osama bin Laden, Sharif was an
advocate of establishing an “Is-
lamic order” in Pakistan complete
with a legal system based on the
Quran. '

He also presided over the
testing of Pakistan’s ﬁrst nuclear
weapons.

But why shouldn’t a man with
ties to al-Qaeda and a track record
of detonating nuclear weapons be
in a position of power? After all,
democracies aren’t perfect, and it’s
important that the decisions of

the masses are respected when it

comes to who will represent their

Democracy not always the solution

Howard, page 8
interests in government.

Well, maybe not.

Replacing a weak dictator with
a weaker, fractioned and corrupt
democratic government isn’t going
to solve Pakist'an’s problems. 'In—
stead, giving the Pakistani people
access to nuclear weapons through
their democratically elected lead-

create new and more spectacular
problems for both Pakistan and its
neighbors.

But solutions to the Pakistani
political question, and indeed
the question of governance and
nuclear weapons in general, are
proving elusive. Dictatorships
these days are just too weak or too
repressive.

What we need is one that is
just right, and regrettably it ap-
pears that those days are long past.

A Marshall Tito and de Gaulle’ are

long gone, the remarkable states-
manship and exceptional sense of
civic duty that characterized their
governments is not to be found in
the “Mugabes” of today.

And so today we are left with

can lose motivation. This is why advisers
should be like personal mentors. They
should not only give students advice

-on what kind ofacademic routethey

should take, but also what kind of
extracurricular route they should take
in order to; become well—rounded
students. I

‘ Students Affairs officials spent two
years developing the OCC, Humphrey
said. While Humphrey added that the

only expense was the card scanners,.

the amount of time and energy devoted
to creating the program could have
been best spent elsewhere, perhaps on

improving the advisingtprocess.

The OCC is meant to be a road map,-
guiding students who wouldn’t normally ,

participate in activities. But would
those same students have the initiative
to take part in this program? And if they
do, would they find themselves getting
used to guidance and be unprepared to
navigate success after graduation? Akey
part of success is "knowing how to be
resourceful on your own.

While we applaud the efforts of
Pitt officials in developing the OCC,
we believ; that it takes much more to
ensure students’ success. _

the secret to democracy is that it’s

Dear Editor,

This is an open letter regarding the

reason for moving Monday classes to
Tuesday, I also think it is a bad idea.

I commute and work part—time in

full-time, so my schedule has to be

duds that the American ' people
have gleefully placed in positions

I for one hope that Pakistan

the weakness of Musharraf and
the instability of democracy.

an  f">at:..!re ‘(*2-y‘
Tom Vartﬁuren

Ten years after starring in the original Broadway cast of
"Rent/‘Anthony Rapp is premiering his new one-man show
in Pittsburgh this week. "Without You,” based on his mem-
oir ofthe same title, infuses the music of”Rent”with original
compositions to tell Rapp’s personal story of love and loss.

The Pitt News sat down with Rapp at City Theatre in
Pittsburgh's South Side, where ”Without You" opens Thurs-
day night,to talk about”Rent,”the Pittsburgh theater scene
and the challenges of re—enacting one's personal life for a

crowd.

The Pitt News: How did
you decide to premiere
”Without You” in Pitts—
burgh?

Anthony Rapp: I've
known Tracy Brigden, the
artistic director here, for
years, like since I was I9 or
20. And we've had a really
nice relationship over those
years, and a few years ago I

 did”Hedwig [and the Angry
 lnch]” here, and that was

an incredible experience.
Because of that it became
kind of an artistic home
away from home for me.

l’d written the book
never thinking it would be
a theater piece, really.l had
no intention of doing that,
but I was encouraged by
a producer friend of mine.
We did a reading of it and it
went really well, and at that
point I thought it would be
really meaningful to have
the premiere‘ of it here. I
feel like it's a safe place for
me artistically, and I really

trust Tracy.l know I'm being '

dealt with in a really honest
way. '

TPN: How do you tackle

a project like adapting your
memoir into a show?

AR: I really didn't-know
where to begin. My director,
Steve Mailer,and I had been
looking for something to
do together for a long time.
When I got asked to do this,
he was the first person I
called.I really believe in him
as an artist.

TPN: What's it like per-
forming a true story, acting
as people you know and
reliving events of your own
life?

AR:It’s moreintensethan
I ever thought it would be.
Working on the book was
really intense and writing it
was really hard,and the au-
dio book was challenging,
but it was still reading‘ it,
which is different from per-
forming it, from bringing it
to life. There are moments.
in rehearsal where I'm hav-
ing a conversation that I
had with my mom, and 
it's not like I become her,
but it's more like I evoke
moments. It is like reliving it
again more fully than ever
before.

The banjo finds its roots in "Africa"

by Kelsey Shea
Staﬁ’ W/rite/*

From Africa to Appalachia

Jayme Stone and Mansa
Sissoko

Rocks like: Vampire
Weekend

In Jayme Stone
and Mansa Sis-
 soko’s new album
,  From Africa to Ap-
pzz/ar/9z'a, the duo
ﬁnd the origin of American mu-
sic by tracing it back to its African
roots.

The collaborative album em-
ploys _both,,Arneri_can instruments

 

i like the banjo and AfricaniInsttu—

ments like the kora, a 21—stringed
African harp, to back up Sissoko’s

_ Malian Griot singing and create a

unique but enthralling blend of
American folk music and\tradi—
tional African music.

 

Much of the album is simple
and graceful instrumentals with
guitar and banjo parts interweav-
ing with traditional African instru-
ments.

The combination of multiple-
string instruments creates an in-
tricate, beautiful sound that often-
times seems to conform to neither
of the two genres.

Though multiple instruments
are almost always playing, the
overall result is surprisingly sirn-
ple, clear and relaxed. I ,

Though the album feature
both genres of music, not every
song is a hybrid of African and
Appalachian music. Many songs,
like “June Apple,” have a much

more clearly‘ deﬁned "American

‘bluegrass sound to them and rely
heavily on the banjo, guitar and
ﬁddle, making them sound far
more like Stone’s ﬁrst solo album,
The Utmost.

Other songs on the album,

like “Tunya,” “Sila” and “Dakar,”
sound much more like African
music. The kora is easily distin-
guished on these songs and with
Sissoko singing in his native lan-
guage, the music sounds like mod-
ernized and Americanized tradi-
tional Mali songs.

Though there are lyrics on the
album, none of them are in Eng-
lish. Sissoko sings in his native lan-
guage. Though it’s likely not un-
derstandable, the language itself
is so different from what listeners
are used to hearing that it makes
the vocals unique.

They’re able to be enjoyed
without the burden of compre-
hension of deeper meanings,

' "which allows listeners to really ap-' ‘

preciate the sheer auditory experi-
ence. Sissoko’s voice is strong and
clear, and his diction brings yet
more rhythm to the music without
taking away from it’s simplicity.
The collaboration between

Stone and Sissoko began after
Stone made a trip to Mali last
year. - .

The Canadian award—winning
composer and banjoist had re-
leased his ﬁrst solo album in 2007
after previously playing with the
jazz and roots group Tricycle.

While in Mali, Stone became

interested in the roots of Ameri-
can music and wanted to further
explore African rhythm and in-
struments, as well as the origin of
the ﬁve-stringed banjo. _
A From Africa to Appa/ac/2221 man-
ages to integrate the two instru-
ments, as well as combine Malian
music with the jazz, folk and roots
music he knew.

 "OveraJ1;"Fmms*Aﬁz'm to‘ Appa-

/acbigz is a rich and interesting al-
bum that uses world music that

,wouldn’t have drawn in many
,American listeners and makes it

more accessible by adding in mod-
ern American inﬂuences.

Not even Batman can sink "Titanic' record

If you guessed the boat, you

having the highest domestic gross

Cameron’s love story has held for

10 years. - . _ ,

Excitement for this year’s Pitt
 men’s soccer team is high.
After all, they have to want re-
demption after going 3-13-2 last
year.
 Pitt coach Joe Luxbacher said
 he’s ready to get that redemption.
“I think we’re much deeper at
every position,” said Luxbacher.
“There is a lot of competition,
which is good. It makes every play-
er raise  level.”
So far, the Panthers seem to be
on track for a much-irnproved sea-
' son, having gone 2-0-1 thus far in
, ' preseason exhibition games.
_,V Pittsburgh has shut out both
 California University of Pennsylva-
0 I nia (3-0) and Mount St. Mary’s (2-0)
‘ in home scrirmnages at Founders
 Field, while settling for a 2-2 tie at
 Penn State.
 Although they’re just preseason
games, the Panthers coaching staff
 is happy with what they’ve seen so
‘ far.

“We really dominated the
game,” said Luxbacher of the win
over California University.

“Although they’re a Division

7 II team, a win is always nice and
 is good for the conﬁdence of the
players.”

But the Panthers, who are en-

The Littman Test

by Adam Littman
Senior Staﬁ’ Writer

Angel Valodia Matos embodies
what the Olympics are all about.
Yes, Michael Phelps swam more
than a few times, Usain Bolt obliter-
 ated all who dared to race him, and
China put on beautiful opening and
closing ceremonies to the games.
But those were just side attrac-
tions.
Matos, a taekwondo competitor
- from Cuba, hurt his foot during the
bronze-medal match against Arman
Chilmanov of Kazakhstan. Matos

tering their 53rd year at Pitt, have
not named their captains for this
upcoming season.

Luxbacher is expected to speak
with assistant coach Brian Retzloff
to discuss how to approach the
captain situation _this year.

The vacancy might be ﬁlled
any number of ways ranging from

a season captain to a captain on a ‘

game-by-game case.

“A soccer team requires a lot of
leaders, not just the captains,” said
Luxbacher of the undecided issue.

“\We’re looking for guys who
lead by example. That’s what this
team needs.”

On the goaltending front, the
starting position is still up for grabs
as both red—shirted seniors Eric
Barnes and Jordan Marks have
been getting equal playing time
thus far during practice and scrim-
mages.

Last season, Marks started the
majority of the games, but both
Barnes and Marks had similar
goals-against averages, which might
suggest the increase in competition
already at this stage.

Offensively the Panthers look
to be led by last season’s top goal
(4) and point (9) getter, senior 
McCormick. Other players who
ﬁgure to contribute this year in-
clude junior Matt Baker, who last
season was the team’s shot leader

took a seat on the mat while wait-
ing for medical attention, which is
allowed for one minute under com-
petition rules.

After the minute was up, the ref-
eree signaled that Matos had taken
too long, and it was clear he wouldn’t
be able to continue So, he was dis-
qualiﬁed. Matos was  3-2 in
the second round of the match.

After being told he was disquali-
ﬁed, Matos kicked the referee in the
face.

Now, I don’t want to advocate vi-
olence, especially against referees, but
I might just have to in this situation.

(27), along with sophomore Ryan
Brode.

Senior Matt Foster should an-
chor the Panthers defense, which is
expected to be much well improved
this season.

“The defense is much better
this season,” said Luxbacher.

“[_That] will help the offense by
creating more turnovers and op-
portunities for scoring.”

Andy Kalas, who enters his
sophomore year, is also expected to
contribute heavily on the defense,
while still providing an offensive
touch after having scored two goals
last season. Junior Samuli Ahola is
another top returning defenseman.

The Panthers have played three
preseason exhibition games as they
tuned up for their ﬁrst tournament
hosted by Robert Morris Univer-
sity. The 10-day, four—opponent
series begins Aug. 29 and will be
Pitt’s ﬁrst look at the intensity and
stamina a tournament brings.

Albany, which will also attend
the tournament, is expected to be
the team’s toughest challenge thus
far.

Following the Robert Morris
tournament, the Panthers will host
a three-day invitational starting
Sept. 12. Pitt will face both Bryant
University and Western Michigan

before beginning the regular sea-
son on Sept. 19 at home against

The true face of the Olympics?

Matos had spent the last few years
training for these Olympic games,
and then lost his shot at a medal not
because he was beaten, but because
a referee decided he couldn’t ﬁght
anymore

Well, if you saw the clip, or at least
a hilarious picture of the kick, it’s fair-
ly clear his legs were working ﬁne
Now granted, I doubt kicking a ref-
eree takes as much skill as competing
against a fellow Olympian, but he still
made the referee bleed, which leads
me to believe he could’ve continued.

And Matos isn’t some young,
inexpedenced hothead. He won the

To me, that’s what the Olympics

has already reached the pinnacle of
his career by  a gold medal in
the Olympics, yet he still continues to
put so much effort into his matches.

Pitt D ready to make
its mark in Big East

by Zack Chakan
Agmiata/It Sparta Editor

What do the Walter Camp Award, the
Chuck Bcdnatik Award, Outland and Lott Tro-
phies and preseason all—American candidates all
have in common?

They are all members of the potentially le-
thal defcnsc of Pitt football.

Now, the nation’s ﬁfth-ranked defense from
2007 looks to instill fear into the eyes of its Big
East foes under new defensive coordinator Phil
Bennett.

Bennett was hired by head coach Dave
Wannstedt to replace the departed Paul Rhoads
in February. Bennett had served as the head
coach at Southern Methodist University from
2002-07.

He takes over a squad with returning tal-
ent across the board, with its ﬁrst test coming
Saturday afternoon against Bowling Green at
Heinz Field.

And after along summer of workouts and
camp, Bennett is pleased with where his unit
stands.

“This is my 30th camp, and I think these
kids have really had the ﬁght focus and the right
attitude,” said Bennett; “I’ve asked them indi-
vidually, ‘\What’s different?’ They feel like there’s
a conﬁdence that maybe has not been here.

 

“I do know this, they’ve worked extremely
hard. The  that we’ve done poorly, we’ve
corrected.”

The new defensive skipperwill have quite an
anchor in middle linebacker Scott McKillop.

The 6—foot—2, 240—pound senior broke out
last year in his first season as a starter. After
watching current Washington Redskin H. B.
Blades dominate for two campaigns, McKillop
ﬁlled the vacancy just ﬁne when Blades gradu-
ated. He led the nation in tackles last year with
12.6 per contest.

McKillop has garnished the most national
recognition on the defensive side of thcgball for
the Panthers. Several publications have named
McKillop as a preseason all—American, while he
has also been tabbed as a candidate for the Wal-
ter Camp Player of the Year Award, the Chuck
Bednarik Defensive Player of the Year Award
and the 2008 Lott Trophy.

McKillop doesn’t: stand alone on the line-
backing core. He will be flanked by returning
starters Adam Gunn and Shane Murray.

Gunn is also a redshirt senior who attended
Kiski Area High School with McKillop. Hc’s
known for his smarts and knack for the ball

Murray came to Pitt as a quarterback but
found a home at outside linebacker. He started
every game last season.

The team’s depth at linebacker is high on

Alex Marsh / MCT

Michael Phelps‘ eight gold medals in one Olympics smashed Mark Spitz's record of seven.
Phelps, 25, now has 14 gold medals after breaking the record that was in place since 1972.

Littman, page 13

Apparently ofﬁcials didn’t see this as an
act of passion for  unlike me and the
people in attendance that day. They promptly
banned Matos and his coach for life from com»
peting in any future events.

“This is an insult to the Olympic vision, an
insult to the spirit of taekwondo and, in my
opinion, an insult to mankind,” said \X/orld Tae—
kwonclo Federation Secretary—General Yang
]in—suk said to the Associated Press.

Talk about an overreaction.

If anything, Matos should be commended.
Maybe not with an_Olympic medal but at least
with a trophy of some sort. Preferably one with
aygold-colored plastic man  a referee on
top. 0

I don’t want to blame the referee, Chakir

any athletes who compete in sports where a
piece of equipment can be used as a weapon.

This could include javelins, Volleyballs or dis-
cuses.

So take this as an example for future referees
or a breath of fresh air for the Olympics.

“We didn’t expect  like what you
have witnessed to occur,” said Yang.

“I am at a loss for words.”

“Thanks,” or ‘Way’ to go Nlr. Matos,” would
sufﬁce, I feel.

So often when an athlete wins a medal at the
Olympics, we see them take a picture while kiss-
ing or  a bite out of the medal. g_

ot while on the podium, listeriinghtio their
national anthem, they mouth the words Or
stand  cry. All of which are fine, enjoyable
things to i§ee. ‘

needing stitches. And it was easily the highlight
of the 2008 Olympics.

athleticism and potential but low on experi-
ence and results The Panthers could fall into
trouble if someone gets hurt — which has al-
ready happened. _

Murray tweaked his knee in the last week
of camp, leaving Pitt scrambling for a replace-
ment The club responded with f1fth—year se-

‘rfiior Austin Ransom, a former impact special-
teamer who started camp at wide receiver.

The coaches have been impressed with
Ransom after the position switch.

“I had him last spring at safety,” said Ben-
nett. “At the end of spring, I looked at my pro-

duction chart, and every fourth play he made.
He runs a,4.5 [40-yard dash], he’s 215 pounds,
and if you watch him, he’s like a little buzz saw
out there. Wherever the“ ball is, he’s there.

The Panthers are loaded with young line-
backers who are still ﬁghting for backup jobs.
Nate Nix, Tristan Roberts, Brandon Lindsey,
Greg \X/illiams and Max Gruder headline that
group.

“We’ve got to develop a little bit of depth,”
said Bennett

W/annstedt agreed, adding that there’s still
no clear idea for who the backups will be.

“There wasn’t the clear separation with
some of those guys,” said \X/annstedt;

The list is so long that Gateway freshman
Shayne Hale, one of Pitt’s top recruits, hasn’t
received many reps in camp and will likely red-
shirt

But for all of the attention aimed at McKil—
lop, the real force might be the defensive line.

Pitt entered camp two—deep at all four po-
sitions on the line, possessing eight athletes
who could all start at a moment’s notice. Only
defensive end Doug Fulmer succumbed to in-
jury and will miss his second consecutive full

season.

Despite Fulmefs hardships and the move-
ment of John Malecki to the offensive line,
defensive line coach Greg Gattuso said he has
confidence that Pitt’s front four could be one
of the best in the conference.‘

Defensive tackle Gus Mustakas returns af-
ter  a medical redshirt last season. \_While
not playing since last years second game, Mus-
takas’ pedigree was enough to have him named
to the Outland Trophy watch list. The Outland
Trophy is given to the best interior lineman in
college football.

Mustakas should join Mick Williams to start
on the inside. \X/illiams was a star at camp, con-
tinuously earning praise from \‘(/annstedt.

The starting ends will be Greg Romeus and
Jabaal Sheard. T

Romeus had four sacks last season and was
named a freshman all-American by numerous
media outlets. Sheard is a true sophomore who
had a strong camp to impress coaches and seize
the opportunity offered by Fulmer’s 

Veterans Tommie Duhart and Rashaad
Duncan will spell Mustakas and \X/illiams on
the inside often and provide ample explosive-
ness of their own. Tony Tucker has pushed for
playing time on the end, with Myles Caragein
and Tyler Tkach likely to see the field as well.

But don’t forget about the secondary.

Kennard Cox and Mike Phillips graduated
from last year’s crew, but Jovani Chappel and
Dom DeCicco made the effortless transition
into starting roles for 2008.

Chappel will play opposite one of the Big

Easfs best corners, Aaron Berry. Berry will

also return punts for the Panthers, with the Pitt
coaches hoping he becomes a Darrelle Revis-
type force as a shut-down cornerback.

Senior Eric Thatcher paces Pitt’s secondary.
The free safety made 53 tackles last year and
has stepped into a crucial veteran leadership
role.

DeCicco appears to have won the strong
safety battle with Elijah Fields, but both will see
plenty of snaps.

DeCicco mainly played on special teams
last year, while Fields missed the whole season
after being suspended for violating team rules.

 Gary and Buddy Jackson williback
up Berry and Chappel. Gary saw signiﬁcant
playing time last year as a freshman, starting
three contests. If Jackson continues to develop,
the coaches say he might become Pitt_’s jewel.
Coaches praise him as the fastest player on the
whole squad and possibly the most athletic. A

“His deal is focus,” said Bennett of jack-

son.
"I will never ever question Buddy’s desire

to want to play, its just that he’s got to be fo-

cused.” - , .

That focus is integral for the defense as a
whole, in order to meet its lofty expectations
for 2008.
