Ladies, Gentlemen:

We Present The High
Command vs. Hitler

By IRVING KAUFIVIAN

One of the stranger aspects
in the rumored case of Hitler
versus the High Command of
the Reichswehr is the apparent
fact that if the armyvwins out,
Germany, and Europe, will
have peace for several years to
come.

Today, when the naval chiefs
of this country are being accused
of fomenting trouble, and when
the military castes of all nations
are being watched fearfully, the
statement that the Junkerjclique
of the world’s most military-mind-
ed nation is a comparative factor
for present day peace seems pecu-
liar.

But the truth is, that the Ger-
man army officers are realists, as
are all professional soldiers, while
Hitler is a ﬂighty fanatic. Being
realists, the High Command knows
that its nation is in no position to
buck the, European democracies
and the Russian Soviet and will
not be in such a position for sev-
eral years.

Premature Explosion

They know that Hitler is likely
to go off half-cocked, that, if he
becomes an absolute, Kaiser-like
personage, he is liable to grab the
Ukraine, and prematurely light
the fuse. For these seasons,
among others, they have been op-
posing the Fuhrer‘s attempts to
Nazify Germany completely.

According to the over-seas ob-
servers, the ranking officers of the
German army bitterly opposed
Hitler’s interference in Spain. If
this was so, it was an indication
that the General Staff realized its
army and its nation had not yet

reached its maximum war
strength.
The last six months have

brought the army crisis to a head.
The Church persecutions, the
Spanish escapade, and the con-
stant friction between the regular
army’ and Hitler’s pet legions of
Nazi youth-sol_diers, have culmin-
ated in a wide breach, if any cred-
ence is to be given to the papers.

If Hitler increases his powers
over the army and can subjugate
all unsympathetic elements in the
Reichwehr, Germany, fully pre-
pared or no, will probably start on
another adventure. If the army
wins out, they will still use Hitler
as a ﬁgurehead, and they will
keep the peace———until they are
ready to break it.

Heil-Stoning

That they will break the peace
at their own discretion is an obvi-
ous fact. Germany’s feverish
stripping for action is being done
for more reasons than to boost the
nation’s respect, morale, and in-
ﬂuence. ‘The’ whole Reich is" arm-
ing for conquest. ;

Meanwhile, the democratic na-
tions are hoping that the Hitler-
army quarrel will result in a post-
ponement “or ' 3 further European
trouble. In other words, F_rance,
England, Russia, and the frag-
ments of the Little Entente, who
do not want, war today, are hop-
ing that Hitler gets bounced from
the saddle. _

These nations, and the rest of
the world are waiting to see if
there will be a “game” today, or
if the “game” haspbeen postponed
because of a severeflurry of Hell-
stoning.

Novel Treatment
Of Popular Song

“Bei Mir Bist Du Schoen,”
most captivating swing tune to
appear in many months, has re-
ceived unconventional treat-
ment from many orchestras,[
good and otherwise.

“Bei Mir Bist‘ Du Schoen” is
the subject of another type of
unconventional treatment by Dr.
Bernard C. Clausen, pastor of the
First Baptist church, who speaks
at Inquiry Forum today at 12:30
o’clock in 129 Cathedral.

SPEAKER WELL—KNOWN

Noted for his unusual method
of discussing subjects of religion
and of everyday life, Dr. Clausen,
if he follows his usual style, is
expected to relate “Bei Mir” to
some practical aspect of student
life.

Appearing at many campus
meetings, Dr. Clausen has become
widely known among University
students. He has spoken at Uni-
versity assemblies, Freshman
Camp, Pitt Peace Council, and
several YM-YWCA clubs.

QUESTIONS ANSWERED

Following the usual Inquiry
Forum procedure, Dr. Clausen
will address the meeting for the
ﬁrst half of the hour, then answer
questions from_ the floor for the
remainder of the period.

Today’s meeting is open to all
students and faculty members.

Seminar Hears
Observations
On Eugenics

“The populace of the western
nations is probably getting more
stupid and less sound physically,
and in some parts is failing to re-
produce,” -Dr. Frank Hamilton
Hankins, professor of’ economics
and sociology at Smith College,
declared Friday at Social Science
Seminar.

Pointing out his observations in ~

the study of eugenics and present-
ing an outline of some technical
points in the scope of negative eu-
genics, Dr. Hankins backgrounded
his talk by portraying the world
“We have
a world that craves
continually prepares for war,-” Dr.
Hankins commented.

Dr. Hankins added that the
quality of offspring is deteriorat-
ing, basing his view on the belief
that the upper classes are genetic-
ally superior to the lower.

“The richer people have smaller
families, statistics show. Hence
talent tends to disappear. The
grounds for this belief are social
mobility, universal education, and
differential fertility,” he explain-
ed.

In the second half of his discus-
sion, a technical outline of nega-
tive eugenics, Dr. Hankins cited
that in a recent careful inquiry
made in England, it was shown
that 29 percent ofmental defective
cases was due exclusively to her-
edity, nine percent due to envir-
onment, and 62 percent due to
both.

“Many people acquire so many

Geise. He recommended that stu-
dents spend at least an hour sit-
ting without books or notes think-
ing over each hour’s lecture they
have.

Dr. Geise traced some outstand-
ing . developments in approaches
to history in the past centuries.
He_ pointed out changes in the at-
titude’ Eofiliistorians themselves as-

to how their subject should be
treated.

“In the nineteenth century,” we
had historians opposing interpre-
tation,” said Dr.-Geise. “Now, the
growth of industrialism and dem-
ocracy, the two greatest phenom-
ena of our time, has greatly. af-
fected history. Nationalism, too,

Group Discusses Way’
Of Facilitating Student:
Government Function

VVorking on a suggestion
passed by the Student Faculty
Association Assembly at its De-
cember meeting, Ernest Rose,
D38, president of SFA, reports
that a meeting attended by
Chacellor John G. Bowman, Al-
bert Barr, BA38, vice president of
SFA, and himself, points to a so-
lution and an explanation of many
of the problems facing the student
body.

The suggestion of the Assembly
provided for “a closer association
between the administration and
SFA” through the student group’s
president to “discuss recommen-
dations and requests for adminis-
trative, action by the association
or its executive committee.”

According to Rose, Rufus H.
Fitzgerald, who assumed his du-
ties as Provost last week, will be

invited to fu-.

that Mr. Fitz-

the problem of

says Rose, by

between SFA officers and the ad-
ministration.

Lunch rooms and smoking fa-
cilities, says the student president,
will be given greater considera-
tion as soon as funds are ‘availa

Skits Tonight

By NANCY WELFER

This evening at 7:30 o’clock,
fraternity women will climb the
hill to Heinz House once again
to attend the Interfraternity
Sing, an annual event spon-
sored by the Panhellenic Asso-
ciation.

In past years the girls stuck
to fraternity songs. This year,
however, the general subject of
book titles has been imposed.
Thus, “Seven (Kapp) Keys to
Baldpate” comes into its own, and
the Theta’s kite may “go with the
wind.”

RATING SCALE

Cleverness, originality, and
spirit rate higher than singing, for
the ﬁve judges award thirty per-
cent for each of the former and
only ten percent for the latter.

Sole restrictions, aside from
subject, are on time, number of
participants, and expenditure.
For a period of not more than sev-
en minutes, eight or less girls may
act out a title. The accompanist
is not counted in this. For these
skits each fraternity may spend
not more than ﬁve dollars.

JUDGES LISTED

Reward for the best skit is a

bro_nze,cup, to become the perma-

nent possession of the winner. A L-

new cup is put up each year. The
award’ will be made on the basis
of the above percentages. ‘

Judges for the evening include ‘

Dr. Lotte Lohstoeter, assistant
professor ’of modern languages;
Dr. Samuel Williams, professor of
biology; Dr. Harold Schoenberger,
professor of English; Theodore
Finney, director of music; and
Robert X. Graham, director of the
University News service. ' ’

Interfraternity Song "committee,
under the chairmanship of Flor-
ence Siegel, Ed38, is in charge of
the affair. Other members of the

Elliott Plans Production

 0f Second Student Film

Philip C. Elliott, assistant‘ professor of arts, is planning
to make another movie on the University campus.

This time, however, all work in the production of the ﬁlm—-
the writing of the scenario, the acting, and the actual filming——

will be done by students of the University.

Mr. Elliott and

other members of the faculty will act merely as supervisors.
All students interested in any phase-of the work are in-

vited to attend a special showing,

Wednesday at 3:30 p. m., of
“Spring Class,” the movie Mr.

1936. The ﬁlm will be run in the

The writing of the scenario for.
the new movie wi_ll,be. under the
supervision of Frederick _Mayer,
associate professor of English, and
Charles Foreman, graduate stu-

Acting will be directed by Carl
Cass, Pitt ~ Players’ director, and
the photographers will be trained
by Mr. Elliott.

Work on the scenario will begin
next week. The actual filming is
due to begin May 1.

“Spring Class” was ﬁrst shown
last Winter, at the initial program
of a series of foreign ﬁlms spon-

sored by the department of ﬁne

arts. The response to the movie
was so encouraging that Mr. Elli-
ott decided to produce another
one. ‘-

éand will be sent to the World Boy-

cott Conference, a conference of
39 peace organizations now meet-
ing in London.

GOODS LISTED

The literature will contain list-
ings of goods not to be bought,
and a careful analysis of what
world consumer protest could do
in discouraging further Japanese
aggression.

Rosemary Lutz, C39, chairman
of the Council, announced that the
drive was purely private, and was
the most practical way for peace-
loving people “to show their in-
dignation toward an imperialistic
nation.” ,

“We recognize,” she said, “the
danger of government action in
this matter. We who strive for
peace call for a private concerted
program in paralyizing the trade
ﬂow to Japan, which is her life
blood in carrying on her eXploits.”_

AIMS DEFINED .

Specially emphasized was the
fact that the drive was not aimed
against the Japanese people. They
are the mere victims of circum-
stances, according to Peace Coun-
cil oﬂicials, it is the Japanese
government at which the protest
is directed, against the military

leaders responsible for her delib-

erate slicing off of Chinese terri-

tory. ' .

Chairman of the boycot~t-com-
mittee is Joseph Lazirovitz, E41;
with Robert Saffron, C39, Bim
Yee, E40, and Harry Miller, C39,
serving as members. . '

Through an intercollegiate con-_
ferenceto be held February 22,
active support from other city un-
iversities is anticipated. « . ‘

Anti-Japanese Boycott
Begins Here Today

program designed to arouse local support

of the widespread anti-Japanese boycott

in the interest of world peace begins on cam-

pus this morning sponsored by Pitt Peace
Council.

Peace Council’s program reﬂects here the
opening this week of The World Boycott Con-
ference in London where representatives of
thirty-nine international organizations com-
posed of three-hundred million people the
world over are meeting to devise ways and
means of encouraging the boycott of Japanese
goods.

The object of the boycott is obvious. The
proponents of the movement aim to halt Ja-
panese agression by depriving her of the mar-
kets for her domestic products which yield
practically the only source of revenue to sup-
port her extravagant war machine.

Most of the organizations participating in
the London conference are American and Brit-
ish, a signiﬁcant fact when it is considered that
the United States and England by themselves
are markets for sixty-ﬁve per cent of Japanese
foreign trade.

That the consumers of the United States is
holding up this country’s end of program is
evidenced by recent records of the Trade
‘Commission which shows that a great portion
of our trade with Japan has already fallen oﬁ
to a large extent. Importation of silk si al-
ready thirty per cent less than our former pur-
chases, and silk is the largest of our Nipponese
imports.

In addition, six of the largest American
chain stores have already declared that the
patrons of their stores had exerted such pres-
sure that they refuse to retail Japanese goods.

These facts show that the boycott is prac-
tical, that it will be effective.

Objectors to the movement have charged
that American hosiery workers and silk article
producers will lose heavily if the boycott is
widespread. They have also declared that it
will lead to open warfare with Japan.

‘As far as the hosiery and silk workers are
concerned, it has been demonstrated that the
largest producers of these goods have the ma-
chinery with which they can supply goods of
substitute materials already familiar and ac-
ceptable to the American consumer. It has
:also been proved that labor turnover in these
industries will not be much greater than regu-
lar seasonal ﬂuctuations if the boycott move-
ment spreads.

The real danger with which those who op-
pose the boycott are concerned is the one of
involving the United States in a foreign war
because of her “apparent unfriendly act” if
the boycott continues.

This statement can be answered simply. The
boycott in no way involves the United States’
government in her relations with Japan. The
boycott is not one improved by the govern-
ment; it is an agreement among consumers
that they will not purchase goods from a na-
tion whose government is waging a brutal and
inhuman war.

Senator Norris who was one of the most
strenuous objectors to American participation
in the World ‘Var has wholeheartedly support-
ed the consumers’ boycott as a safe and sane
way to quarantine Japan.

Peace Council has stressed that the boycott
is not aimed in hatred at the Japanese people,
but at the imperialistic and war-mad govern-
ment which is crushing its people economically
in order to conquer China by crushing her
physically.

If the internal pressure in Japan can be
brought to such a state where the Japanese
people will no longer support the militaristic
policies of their government, Japan must stop
the war.

Whell one considers that every article either
sold over the counter labeled “Made in Japan”
or others made in this country out of Japanese
raw materials pay for another clip of bullets
or part of a bomb that will ﬁnd its use in de-

stroying Chinese life, the purpose of the anti-
Japanese boycott is forcibly pictured.

Pitt Peace Council has planned an objective
program to be carried on by University stu-
dents. It is its objectivity that lists our sup-
port. The program is merely touched upon
here; stop at their stations and get the com-
plete story.

Handwriting
On The Wall

E THOUGHT that all local University

students had reached at least a minimum
standard of higher intelligence, that they all
had a fair respect for the beautiful, that they
all had constructive, not destructive, aims—-
and then was called to our attention the hand
writing on the wall.

Unlike the Biblical precedent, the hand-
writing on the Wall was a bit of vandalism, and
this bit of vandalism was done in the only
completed Cathedral classroom, Room 132.

The writing of platitudinous editorials
(“Keep off the Grass,” “Don’t‘ Throw Chalk
Out of the \Vindows,” etc.) has always been
repulsive to us; hence we have not indulged.
But some things of the sort call for comment.

Harsh treatment of unﬁnished class rooms
which we have known in the Cathedral can
easily be conceived, can probably be excused.
But there is no justifying the recent. vandal-
ism in Room 132-and we’ll leave that thought
with the lunatic fringe who needs it. They
can supply their own moral or aesthetic argu-
ments or ask the next ninty-nine individuals
whom they meet to supply them. And we’ll
leave that SANE ninety-nine per cent of the
student body to set them right.

Letters

Editor, The Pitt News:
At a meeting of the Pitt Peace Council on De-

cember 19, a resolution was passed to organize a

consumer’s boycott of Japanese 80055 On the Pitt
campus. That the aims and methods of this boy-
cott be understood fully, I am directed by the
Peace Council to outline the essential features of
the boycott resolution for publication in The Pitt
News.

First, the Japanese Boycott has not been organ-
ized blindly. We have been most sincere in our
efforts to View the situation in the far East ob-
jectively, and also to see that the present conﬂict
between China and Japan is rooted in more funda-
mental caluses than can be settled by a boycott
alone.

We feel that the boycott itself must be consider-
ed a temporary weapon inﬂicted on Japan that
must be lifted at once should Japan cease her ag-
gressive policy. Should the consumer’s boycott,
which has become international in scope, succceed
in stopping the present war, every effort must be
made to secure peaceful trade appeasement in the
Pacific .

That the boycott might not become a nationalis-
tic expression of hatred, we ask that those who
support our program feel that they are aiming
their boycott at the government of Japan rather
than at her people whose sad plight is an object of
sympathy . ~; I

Wible Believes ‘Europa’
Superior To Sequel

I-lero Described As Weak Character Who
Elucidates Philosophical Common Places
By Clarence Wible

The Library recommends :

Europa in Limbo by Robert
Robert Briifault’s Europa was a decidedly successful novel
This same author’s Europa. in Limbo is
destined to suffer, as most sequels do, by comparison wit'h the
earlier Work. And suffer it does.

Like James Cabell, Briifault relies mainly on pithy porno-
graphy and semi-profound observations on the foibles and evils
of contemporary civilization for his popular appeal.
Briﬁault was delightfully and interestingly dirty; his pro-

of a few years back.

I Briﬁ‘a.ult.

In Europa

fundities, mouthed by the pro-¢

tagonist of both of his novels, Ju-
lian Bern, were duly impressive.

CONTINUES TRADITION
Briffault seems to have lost his
touch. And when Briffault’s pro-
foundities become obscurities and
his pornography becomes tire-

some and futile, his work certain-
ly loses much of its appeal.

Europa in Limbo continues in
the tradition of Europa in describ-
ing the degeneracy and hypocrisy
that seemed to characterize life in

Europe in the years immediately
preceding and following the Great
War. Julian Bern, the protagonist
in the tragedy of life during these
periods, is of the super-man Doc
Savage type. It seems that there
is nothing that Julian does not
know.

KNOWS HIS VVANTS

He is a scholar, philosopher,
economist, and traveler par ex-
cellence. But in spite of this for-
midable array of accomplishments,
Julian Bern is a weak character.
Bern’s philosophy and observa-
tions are well-deﬁned; but we
know too little of the man him-
self to take his thoughts or the
author’s too seriously. Mr. Brif-
fault knows what he wants Bern
to do and say, but he seldom takes
the trouble to provide sufficient

motivation for his thoughts and
actions.

Bern is, of course, a mere prop
upon which Mr. Briffault hangs
his own particular observations.
And throughout both novels, more
so in Europa in Limbo, he remains
merely an undistinguished color-
less wisp of a man. All the other
characters are so typed, manufac-
tured by the author to ﬁt certain
situations and observations that

Mr. Briffault’s observations, like!
those of that great purveyor ofl

but it’s all been said before, some-
times better, sometimes worse.
Mr. Briffault presents as startling
revelations things that have been
taken for granted for the last ﬁf-
teen years. For instance, he brings
out the amazing fact that the
World was helped along towards
war in 1914-18 by certain men
who saw in war great opportuni-
ties for making money. Nothing is
truer or has been accepted as
factual for so many years previous
to the writing of Europa in Limbo.

- STOP and co -

By Nick Spanos ' '

WARNER

Queen. Victoria, heading the
double bill at the Warner, follows
the English tradition in that it
finds the English meditating on
themselves and, as usual, being
duly impressed.

The picture covers the sixty
most self-righteous years in Eng-
lish history, and does it very well.
Forgetting the reverence with
which everything is handled, we
are left with a story that is very
stirring and moving in the same
way that Noel C0ward’s Caval-
cade was stirring and moving.

Anna Neagle handles the role
Helen Hayes starred in on the
stage, in a manner that might
make Helen a little catty; Anton
Walbrook portrays an Albert who
ought to make people forget his
half-hearted Hollywood attempt
at Michael Strogoff.

Because of the time to be cov-
ered—six:cy_ years-—strong conti-
nuity is naturally» not one of the‘
film’s selling points. That is, one
scene does not grow out of an-
other. We are shown merely the‘
highlights in Victoria’s life as a
woman and as a queen.

High spot in the movie is the
Jubilee celebration done in Tech-
nicolor.

Along with Queen Victoria is
Frank Morgan in a little comedy
that will be neither widely known
nor long remembered. It’s one of
those things the theatre managers
blame on block booking. “Don’t
look at me. Blame it on block
booking,” is what they
say.

STANLEY

True Confession, taken from the
song by the same name, is cur-
rently mowing them down at the
Stanley. It is another in the line
of good comedies featuring Carole
Lombard. _ I don’t see how Carole

usually.

gets into so many funny pictures.
She certainly must be getting
around and meeting people. Any-
way she’s in this one and its not
much her fault that it is good.

Neither is it Fred MacMurray’s,
whose recently added mustache
makes him look like Dick Powell
trying to look like Ronald Col-
man. Chief credit for this pic-
ture’s success belongs to the writ-
ers and to the best cast of sup-
porting players who ever support-
ed Carole Lombard.

The screen play was done by
Claude Binyon and the bit play-
ers are headed by Una Merkel and
Edgar (slow burn) Kennedy. Bet-
ter than either of these, however,
was a district attorney whose bur-
lesque of a prosecutor was, as
they say in the Delt house, excru-
ciating. It was he who made the
courtroom sequence the best thing
in the film.

Also thrown in for good meas-,
ure, but for no apparent‘ reason,
was John Barrymore, formerly
known as “The Face.” From lover
to screwball seems to be Barry-
more’s lot‘. He is much more like-
able in the latter role and makes
the two stars look bad every time
he is on with them.

Only drawback to True Con-
fessions is the comedy work (paid
advt.) of those two zanies Carole
Lombard and Fred MacMurray.

The Duke is on the stage with
a show that is just about the
same as stage shows have been
for the lastt -couple of month of
Sundays.

FULTON

The Fulton holds over “Happy
Landing” which must be better
than we thought last Week.

“That you can prove almost any-

facts that may tend to disprove

Commenting on specialization,
Dr. Geise said that science is a

greatly for it. “Professor Einstein
has dealt with not one small part
of his science, but with the whole
ﬁeld. History, also, is tending to

Panthers Outshoot
Stronger Lions, 39-35

Zeleznik Leads Pitt Cagers Back
Into Conference Title Battle;
Miehoff, State Star, Off Forum

BY KAL KALWARY
Because the better club didn’t shoot well, it lost.

That, in the very brief_ is
over gentleman (this adjective

the story of how Pitt triumphed

will be qualified later on) John

‘Lawther’s Penn State crew on the Stadium boards, Saturday

night, 39-34, and elbowed thei

Eastern Conference chase.

Because the better club didn’t
shoot well, it lost.

That, in the very brief, is the
story of how Pittt triumphed over
gentleman (this adjective will be
qualiﬁed later on) John Lawther’s
Penn Statte crew on the Stadium
"boards, Saturday night, 39-34, and
elbowed their way into second
place in the Eastern Conference
chase.

The jam section of the Pitt Band
was on hand, for the ﬁrst time
this season, to add rhythm to the
most interesting and complete ﬂoor
battle waged on the home ﬂoor
this year, and to salute an over-
due Panther win. They could have
saluted Coach Johnny Lawther,
too.

NEITHER HAS EDGE

The Lion mentor showed what
gentlemen sportsmen are made of.
He jumped from the bench to call
time-out for Captain Johnson,
when the Pitt leader slumped to
the floor after smacking the wall
in an under the bankboard scram-
ble for the ball. Johnson was
later taken from the game, with a
sprained ankle, somewhat shaken
:up.

By coming onto the ﬂoor this
‘way, the State tutor jepordized
his own victory chances. For the
Ioﬁicials could have scored his in-
terference in the game, and offer-
ed Pitt a charity toss.

Neither ﬁve held a good point
«edge on the other during the ﬁrst
‘half. The Statemen didn’t ﬁnd it
too difficult to move into the Pan.-
ther register zone, but they just
couldn’t inﬂuence the Pitt mesh to
sing a scoring tune.

BOOST SCORE

Penn’s court quarterback, center
Prosser, with his over-head push
shots, and rugged Reichenbach,
star of the game, did the major
:scoring for the College, Pa., quint.
Sta.te’s Eastern Conference I high
scorer, Captain Miehoif, had a bad
‘evening’ with the baskets, making
only two ﬁeld goals out of twenty
attempts, and two out of six free
‘throws, for six points.
gave the fans everything.

Radvansky and Zeleznik boosted
the Pitt score in the last six min-
utes of play, Rags on a long arch,
and Zilch, on a hook-pass from

r way into second place in the
A

Garcia. The Panthers never lost
this point advantage. The Lions
looked much the classier of the two
teams, but the hoops—which count
most—wouldn’t credit their bril-
liant basketball.

In a story book ﬁnish, the Carl--
son quin.t staged a seven point ral-
ly. And again it was the Rad-
vansky-Zeleznik combination, with
substitute Scott, peppering the
Penn bucketts, to give Pitt its
four point victory margin.

Prosser, Penn State, and Zelez-
nik, were high men, with eleven
marks apiece. Reichenbach, State,
was next, with 10.

Records Withstand Cinder Squad’s Battering
But Temple Cou.ldn’t Check Panther Punches

Ohl Sets Only
New Record
In Indoor Meet

\Vith one eye" on his track-
men, one eye on the stop-Watch,
and if you ’11 pardon the arith-
metic, one eye on next week’s
New York A. C. meet, Coach
Carl Olson saw enough during last
Saturday’s University Indoor
Track Championships to prove
that this Panther track squad will
be well balanced and well rep-
resented in all events.

OHL CRACKS MARK

The sophomores took advantage
of the initial home meet of the
season and stole the show. While
sophomore Frank Ohl was beating
his classmate Al Ferrara, in the
two lap run, Ed Routch cracked
the running broad-jump record.

The new standard had a short
life. Ohl -caught his wind and re--
cracked the record. Another
sophomore Allen lVIcKee headed
the 440 brigade to the wire. John
Bayzk and Larry Peace, also sec-
ond year men, ﬁnished 1-2 in the
shot—put.

The University records with-
stood the battering of the cinder-
man better than was expected.
However, Johnny Woodruff and
Pete Bennet, were kept out of the
meet and thus saved the half mile
and high jump marks. In addi-
tion to the new broad-jump mark,
Ken Ryden tied the 50 yard low
hurdles for the sole varsity con-
tributions toward new records.

Huskies Engaged
For Grid Series

The University of Washington
will have it ﬁrst -opportunity to
avenge the 25-0 lacing administer-
ed them by Pitt in the 1937 Rose
Bowl contest, September 30, 1939,
on their home lot. This will be
the Blue and Gold’s opener.

The Huskies second crack at the
Panthers will come in 1940, at
the Pitt Stadium.’ The exact date
of this game has not as yet been
decided.

‘Bombe, Wargo

Star As Ring
Team Wins, 5-3

Taking up where it left off at
Syracuse, the Golden Cat mitt
team slugged a hard‘ earned vic-
tory over the aggressive Owl
leather pushers by a 5 to 3 count
and continued-. its march toward
the Eastern Conference Champion-
ship.

After the Panthers jumped off
to a 2-point lead, the Temple
boys battled uphill and knotted
the count at two all.

FALCO BEATS CARUSO
Pitt’s 115-pound conference

champ, Ralph Dorand, drew a bye
When IZZY Abrams, Temple’s fly-

weight slugger could not appear.

Johnnie Wargo the Panther 125-
pounder was extended a little
when he had to go three rounds to
win his third kayo in as many
starts. His victim, Comber, al-
though outslugged, kept coming in
for more up to the time referee
Graybar stopped the bout.

A bout which saw both Captain
Ralph Caruso, 135, and Frank Fal-
co hit the canvass once, ended in
the latter’s favor. Falco won by
a close margin.

Jed Curzi ran up against a su-
per foe when he tackled Anthony
Guida, the 145 Conference Champ.
J edio put up a creditable fight, but
his opponent was a little more
seasoned.

LUPEY GAINS DECISION

Temple’s two Mulhern boys are
probably wondering what Bombe
and Ashmann pack in their gloves,
for Tom Mulhern was a victim of
a technical kayo at the hands of
Bombe and Eddie Mulhern kissed
the canvas for 10 long seconds
when Paul Ashmann’s right found
its mark.

In the 175 class, Lupey Lupinac-
Ci Stood in the center of the ring
and watched his opponent, Pow-
ers, dance and clown from corner
for two rounds. Lupey then land-
ed a few telling blows which gave
him the decision. Powers didn’t
land a blow.

With this victory safely tucked
away, the Pitt boys are looking
forward to Catholic U. and Penn

Participation in Athletics

1. No man who has ever received
any pecuniary reward or its equiva-
lent by reason of his connection
‘with athletics—wh'cther for playing,
coaching. or acting as teacher in
any branch of sport or engaging
therein in any capacity—shall rep-
resent this University on any ath-
letic team. except that the Athletic
Council may permit such participa-
tion in intercollegiate athletics by
men who might technically be do.-
barred under the letter of the rule
‘but in the judgment of the Athletic
Council have not ‘commercialized
their ,a.thletic_ ability nor offended
against the “spirit of the foregoing
‘provision.

2. No student shall represent this
University on any athletic team who
receives from others than those on
Vvhom he is naturally dependent for
ﬁunncial support. money or the
equivalent of money. such as hoard
or lodging‘. etc.. unless the source
and character of these gifts or pay-
nicnts to him shall be approved by
the Athletic Council on the ground
that they have not accrued to him
primarily because of his ability as
an athlete.

In cases in which the motives for
extending aid to an athlete are not
clear to the Athletic Council, the
(‘ouncil shall take into account fail-
ure on the part of the athlete to
maintain a creditable record in his
academic course. in character, schol-
arship -and willingness to meet his
obligations, as evidence that a con-
tinuance of ﬁnancial aid to the ath-
lete on the ground of character, con-
duct and scholarship seems unwise,
and that. therefore, the Athletic
Council may have to declare him in-
eligible.

In interpreting Rules 1 and 2, the
Athletic Council shall take into con-
sideration the motives of those who
give the aid and the motives of those
who receive it.

ally dependent for support, the Ath-
letic Council shall then in advance
of his competition decide upon his
eligibility.

3. A student who takes part in
sumnicr baseball or in the work of
a suluzner c:-.m:\. without first ob-
iaining approval of the Athletic
(‘ouncil jeopardizes his right there-
after t represent this University on
any team. The Athletic Council
shall have power. however, to grant
permission in advance to a student
to engage in a.thleti-cs, whether dur-
ing, term time or during‘ vacation,
as a representative of any organiza-
tion not connected with the Univer-
sity. under such conditions. not at

of
in
of

cide cases involving unintentional,

by «anyone except the person on
whom a._ boy is naturally dependent
