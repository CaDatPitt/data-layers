Melissa Tabak didn’t expect to
come out to in front of2,o0o of
her high school peers. Itjust sort
of happened.

Tabak, the political action ‘
chair for the Rainbow Alliance, .

came out during an LGBTQ dis-
cussion in front of her peers when
she sat on a panel with other stu-
dents and teachers.

“It never occurred to me I’d

be coming out,” she said. “It was"

terrifying, but then it was beauti—
ful. My friends congratulated me,
and people I never really talked
to congratulated me.”

When Tabak came to Pitt in
2009, she started to hang around
Rainbow Alliance, the only LG-
BTQ student organization on
campus. But Pitt’s Rainbow Alli-
ance is more than just a place for
the LGBTQ community to come
together andpromote its inter-
ests. It is a club for all people, and
Tricia Doughtery, the organiza-
tion’s president, wants to make
that apparent.

“It’s more of an environment
where everyone feels comfort-
able,” Doughtery said. .“I like
to think_we are a family, or at
least a really tight—knit group of
friends.”

Over the past week, the group
celebrated National Coming Out
Week with various events such as
a movie night, a speak—out night
about coming out experiences, a

At Kennywood, Halloween begins
injanuary.

For months, the staff prepares
for the amusement park’s annual
Halloween event, all in hopes to
elicit screams of terror from its
guests.

Kennywood, an amusement
park in West Miﬁlin, is just one
of several attractions in the Pitts-
burgh area that thrive off the multi-
million—dollar industry of frights
that comes with every Halloween.
It offers Phantom Fright Nights,
which has added a spooky element
to the park for the past 10 years.

rector of Ride Operations Marie

tions to ﬁt its budget.

Kennywood employs 300'

people to walk around the park
dressed up as monsters, vampires,
ghosts and pirates, frightening
guests who tour haunted buildings
and ride roller coasters. The park
even changes every one of its light
bulbs to an electric orange or an
eerie green for added effect. These
changes contribute to a boost in
business during October.

“Fright Nights are extremely
successful,” Jeff Filicko, the public
relations manager at Kennywood,
said. A .

Many college and high school
students attend Fright Night, said
Chris Pope, makeup artist and
head of special effects. The park

Kennywood’s “haunts” — a
term used in the industry for the
Halloween attractions — include
Voodoo Bayou, Dark Shadow Maze,
Haunted N oah’s Ark, Mortem Man-
or and Kennyville Cemetery.

A biotech genetic laboratory
is anew addition to the number
of spooky sites for Kennywood
visitors. Construction ﬁnished
in September for the laboratory,
where an experiment has suppos-
edly gone wrong and resulted in a
mass disease outbreak.

“Kennywood wanted an indus-
trial theme. I always liked ‘Resident
Evil,’ so I wanted to do something
with an outbreak,” Steve Hickman,
the designer of Biofear, said.

Guests walk to the entrance

briefs them about the lab». From
then on, guests run into escaped
mutations and containment
crews.

Kennywood isn’t the only op-
tion —- a haunted house in Bethel
Park offers another option for
those looking for a good scare.

Pittsburgh’s largest haunted at-
traction is Hundred Acres Manor,
a charity haunted house that, like
Kennywood, offers a variety of
haunts.

The haunted attraction is
completely volunteer-based and
donates its proceeds to the Home-
less Children’s Education Fund and
Animal Friends.

Haunts 4 1

include Massacre Mansion, South
Valley Hospital, The Family, The
Maze and Fearscapes Factory. Each
of the haunts can take more than
45 minutes to complete. But for
those who scare easily, there are
exits placed throughout for an
escape.

“Each of those haunts’ have dif-
ferent goals in mind,” Ethan Turon,
the special effects director and op-
erations manager, said. “For those
folk that are into gore, hack them
up, The. Hospital is for them. If
you’re into the creepy ‘Hills Have
Eyes’-style, middle-of-nowhere,
almost-hillbilly-but-not- really, The
Family is for you. If you’re into get-

ting lost and being confused, The
Maze is one of our huge hits, and
we do it every year.”

And business has been boom-
ing for Hundred Acres Manor. It
brings back repeat customers and
guests from as far as Florida.

“On a weekend, [we have] well
over 3,000 individuals that will
come through on weekend night.

. Every year, our attendance does go

up,” Turon said.

Hundred Acres Manor starts
preparing for the next year of scar-
ing starting in November, a month
after the last person escapes the
haunted house.

Each year, the attraction’s orga-

nizers change around the haunts
and makes new themes. Fearscapes
— a factory-themed haunt —— was
a clown house last year, but it’s an
industrial factory this year.

Much of the work is done on site.
Construction goes on throughout
the year, and Turon works every
day to improve different aspects
of the haunts, including painting,
building and web management.

To save money, some of the ma-_
terial that Hundred Acres Manor
gets for costumes and props are
obtained through thrift stores. One
of its sets uses real food encased in
lacquer and painted over.

“The hospital is probably the

most difficult area to design,” Tur-
on said. “Well, conceptually, it’s
very easy to design. When youwalk
into the hospital, you have recep-
tion, observation, brain surgery,
plastic surgery, the boiler room,
operating room, the morgue, the
body-bag room. That makes sense
as a hospital. But go out to a hospi-
tal and say, ‘Oh by the way,_I’d like
your EKG machine,’ it’s not exactly
easy things to obtain like we can on
Craigslist or thrift stores.”

As to why people go to haunt-
ed houses and why there are so,
many good ones in Pennsylvania,

Turon thinks that it’s because of -

the adrenaline rush people get and

Haunts offer various methods of frightening

because of awidespread love for
the horror industry.-Halloween is
heavily celebrated, especially in
the northeast, Turon said.
“We’re the crazies on this side
of the state,” he said. _
Certainly, patrons’ can be scared

. without the real danger. Turon and
his staff just don’t want the guests '

to know that until they’ve ﬁnished
it. When you open the door to the
black-light—lit parlor room of the

haunted house, the year—round ‘

staff ensures that its patrons get
their money’s worth. ,

“It’s a mind-bending experi-
ence, and"we’ll scare the hell outta

self-importance

Elizabeth.Weisel
For The Pitt News

About a month or so into our

‘freshman year, many of us come

to a startling realization: We’re not
as great as we thought we were.
People our age, as numerous
scholars have pointed out, have
developed an inﬂated sense of
self—importance. The culture in
which we grew up cultivated this
attitude and created what psychol-
ogy professor Jean Twenge calls
‘_‘Generation Me.” _
As at Pitt News editorial re-

ported earlier this year, Twenge"

and her colleagues published a
study in British journal Self and
Identity that analyzed students’
conﬁdence levels from 1966 to the
present. The study found that in

2009, about 60 percent of college 6

freshmen considered themselves
more intellectually “self-conﬁ-
dent” than average, compared to
only 39 percent in 1966.

While I could probably attri-
bute our self-importance to any
number of factors, the ﬁrst cul-

prits that come to mind are our

parents, who during the 1970s
saw their ideals of peace and love
shattered by war and cynicism. As
a direct result, they became more
self-centered, believing personal
success to be the only means. of
escaping a corrupt society.

Enter our generation, persons .

born into families that instilled
in their children the same indi-
vidualistic zeal. We were taught
that we are unique individuals
with the potential to accomplish
anything we put our minds to. And
unsurprisingly, we believed it. A
2002 johns Hopkins Center for
Talented Youth study found that
99 percent of academically gifted
children considered themselves
capable of meeting their parents’
expectations.

Clearly, our parents’ encourage-
ment helped our self—perceptions.
However, what we weren’t told

combating our inflated 

was that in order to be success-
ful in a given ﬁeld, we must also
have a “knack” for work in that
ﬁeld — we can’t rely on motiva-
tion alone. So instead of balancing
intelligence and self-awareness,
we ended up with indiscriminate
self-conﬁdence.

One place this problem mani-
fests itself is in social media. A
2010 Digital Surgeons graphic
showed that approximately 29
percent of Facebookusers are be-
tween the ages of 18 and 25 — a
higher percentage than composes
any other age group. It’s not dif-
ﬁcult to see why: The site allows us
to publicize our supposedly sharp
opinions and to delude ourselves
into thinking We’re important
enough that someone, anyone,
will care.

Social media and the Internet
provide ample opportunity for us
to advertise ourselves and seek the
attention that our self-importance
thinks it deserves.

However, just because we’re
the self—important generation
doesn’t mean we have to remain
that way. We just have to learn to
live in reality.

An important first step in
achieving this objective is iden-
tifying our strengths and weak-
nesses early. As children, we
were encouraged to pursue every
imaginable goal. Though this is a
nice sentiment, it’s useless if we

can’t recognize what we can and
can’t excel in. When we identify
our shortcomings at a young age,
we give ourselves time to ﬁnd the
things we can, in fact, accomplish.
Only then can we cultivate our
strengths and make realizing our
dreams a greater possibility.
Living in reality also requires
surrounding ourselves with real-
istic people. Especially now that
we’re in college and separated

from our family, it’s imperative
that we choose our new relation-

friends who are always praising

because both are important.
Lastly, we should remember

that we are, in fact, special, albeit

on a much smaller scale than we

originally thought. We still have.

them, however, until we crack that
shell of self—importance and let
reality seep through. I I

I think it will be interesting to see how the Occupy Wall Street
movement is slanted by the media and by the established politi-

become the leftist version of the Tea Party  But I also keep see-

to it because I’m from New York, and I don’t think that’s their
intention at all. So it’ll be interesting to see how it comes out.

FOOTBALL

Pitt to face familiar offense against Rutgers

Dustin Gabler
Staﬂ" Writer

When the Pitt football team faces
Rutgers on Saturday, the Scarlet
Knight offense will look very fa-
miliar. .
That’s because when head, coach
Dave Wannstedt resigned after the
2010 season, three of his assistant
coaches ended upon Rutgers’ coach-
ing staff '—— and the Panthers. are
familiar with what offensive coor-
dinator Frank Cignetti, tight ends
coach Brian Angelichio and safety
coachjeff Haﬂey bring to the ﬁeld.
Pitt defensive tackle Chas Alecx-

ih, a redshirt senior, said that on ﬁlm _

Rutgers’ offense looks identical to
Pitt’s from last year.

“Power run, stretch, screens, ,

play action passes,” he said. “It’s
what we went against in camp.” -

Still, Alecxih said the Scarlet,

Knight attack won’t be completely
recognizable.

“Frank Cignetti is obviously a
very good offensive coordinator,
so I know he’s going to have a few

surprises in there for us,” Alecxih

said.

Pitt (3-2, 1-0 Big East) is coming
off an upset victory at Heinz Field
over then-No. 16 South Florida.
Now the Panthers are in search of
their ﬁrst road win of the season
against Rutgers in Piscataway, N.J.,
at 3:30 p.m. V g ‘

“I thought we put together the
most complete game up to this
point,” Pitt head coach Todd Gra-
ham said about the win over South
Florida at a press conference on
Monday. “The guys have steadily
improved each and every week. It
was very exciting and it was exciting
for them.”

While Pitt is familiar with the
Scarlet Knights’ offensive attack,
Rutgers’ defense will present the
biggest challenge to Pitt, especially
since the Panthers are likely to play
without senior right guard Lucas
Nix, who injured his knee against

, South Florida. Pitt already lost se-

nior left guard Chris Jacobson for
the season to a knee injury.
Graham said he expects Rut-

gers to blitz and attack a lot, which
prompted him to hold a practice
on Sunday, something he doesn’t
normally do. He also said that
he’s been impressed with redshirt
sophomores Cory King and Ryan
Schlieper, who stepped into starting
roles following the injuries.

He added that what Rutgers does
on defense is probably similar to
Pitt’s philosophy. '

“I really like what Rutgers does
defensively,” Graham said. “They
have a really good system in place.
They have reconﬁgured their de-
fense to create more speed. They
are going to force the issue.”

— Rutgers notched _a win in its ﬁrst

Luc Felakl Senior Staff Photographer

Pitt quarterback Tino Sunseri completed 22 of 33 passes for 216 yards and a touchdown in Pitt’s 44-17 win
over South Florida last Thursday. The Panthers face Rutgers on Saturday.

Big East game last Saturday against
Syracuse, and both the Panthers and
the Knights will look to move to 2-0
in conference play.

“We are excited and our guys are
focused onbeingz-0,” Graham said.
“This is a very critical game in the
Big East. We have six more Big East
games, but this one is the most criti-
cal. We have to go ﬁght and scratch
for 60 minutes, continue to get bet-
ter and ﬁgure out how to be 2-0.”

Graham’s game plan is not a
secret to Rutgers’ head coach Greg
Schiano. Pitt will rely heavily on its
junior running back, Ray Graham,
fresh off his 226-yard rushing per-
formance against South Florida.

“He’s elusive, he’s quick, he’s got
great vision, balance, strength and
he’s really good,” Schiano said in a
press conference on Sunday. “This
is really going to be a huge challenge
for our defense.”

BIG EAST BREAKDOWN

WVU,
Pitt top  
conference

rankings

- R] Sepich
Stajfwriter

Conference play is ﬁnally under way
in the Big East. In the two confer-
ence games last week, Pitt surprised
everyone by destroying then-No. 16
and previously undefeated South
Florida Thursday night on national
television, and it took Rutgers two
overtimes to come away with a big
road win at Syracuse.

This week, Pitt travels to Rut-
gers and West Virginia hosts Con-
necticut.

So with the Big East outlook be-"' ‘

ginning to take shape for the 2011
season, here are my rankings of the
conference’s eight teams.

vv1. West Virginia — The No. 16
Mountaineers (4-1, 0-0 Big East)
are the only ranked team in the
conference. Considering West
Virginia’s only loss came against
the best team in the country, LSU,
the Mountaineers still deserve to
sit at the top of the Big East. Dana’
Holgorsen’s offense seems to be’
fully clicking with quarterback
Geno Smith at the helm, and WVU
reminded everyone that it can still
run the ball successfully: Freshman
running back Dustin Garrison had a
debut party of sorts this weekend,‘-
going for 291- yards in the 55-10 win
over Bowling Green.

2. Pittsburgh — It took four
games to show up, but when it
ﬁnally did, Todd Graham’s high-_;
octane offense stole the show as
Pitt (3-2, 1-0 Big East) rode star run-
ning back Ray Graham’s singular
performance to a 44-17 demolition
of South Florida. Quarterback Tino
Sunseri and the Panthers defense
both played well, but consistency“
will be the next thing Pitt needs to
prove. If the Panthers want to be

MEN'S SOCCER

 

Panthers struggle, fall to Cleveland State at home

Greg Trietley
Senior Staﬁ” Writer

If recent games are any indica-
tion, fans'should prepare for
overtime when the Pitt men’s
soccer team returns to Ambrose
Urbanic Field to face the Seton
Hall Pirates Saturday at 7 p.m.
The Panthers (3-7-1) pulled
out their most dramatic vic-
tory this season when they de-
feated Syracuse 2-1 in double
overtime last Saturday, but the
team followed up the win with

v ea 1-0 overtime loss Wednesday

to the Cleveland State Vikings
(4-6-1).

Senior midﬁelder Sam Luffy
said after the defeat that the
team took a step back from the
improvements it made on the
attacking side of the ball against
the Orange.

“We haven’t been scoring
goals,” Luffy said. “I thought
we kind of solved that against
Syracuse, but tonight we didn’t

get any. We have to find ways to

score goals. It’s been our prob-
lem all season.” '

Pitt has scored nine goals in
11 games this year.

Seton Hall (4-5-2) has had
the opposite problem: It can’t
stop the other team’s attack. The
Princeton Tigers, who had lost
four consecutive games, defeated
the Pirates 7-3 on Tuesday.

The Pirates have allowed 10
goals over the past two games,

""’and they are last in the Big East

with a 1.82 goals-against aver-
age.

Forward Max Garcia, who
leads Seton Hall with four goals
this year, sat out the game against

.:<:sPrinceton CO serve an automatic

one-game suspension brought on
by a red card that he received in a
3-0 loss to Villanova last week.
Anthony Reichwaldt had a
goal and an assist in Garcia’s ab-
sence. The sophomore started

".9 . . .
five games 111 goal earlier this

year, but he recently moved to
forward -— a move that paid off
against the Tigers.

Sophomore goalkeeper Kevin
Bonder relieved starter Mario

It-*DeClerico in both the Villanova

and Princeton losses.Meanwhile,
Pitt freshman Lee Johnston has
been strong in goal despite the

team’s struggles on offense.
Johnston made four saves, in-
cluding one in overtime, against
Cleveland State.

The Panthers had an early
chance to take control against
the Vikings, but defender Jus-
tin Mancine turned away Luffy’s
shot at the goal line in the 10th
minute to keep the game score-
less.

That would be Pitt’s best
chance all evening. Although

.the Panthers out-cornered the

Vikings 9-2, goalkeeper Brad
Stuver did not have to record a
save to earn the victory.

Pitt head coachjoe Luxbacher
said that the team has to be less
selective in its shots in order to
generate more chances.“_I’ve been
harping on the guys all year about
this,” Luxbacher said Wednes-
day. .“We don’t take shots when
they’re there. You don’t have to
have a perfect chance. You need
a half—chance, because stuff hap-
pens. You take a shot, you get a
deflection, who knows.”

Cleveland forward Jordan
Hart’s golden goal in the 95th
minute came in such a man-
ner. Sophomore defender Zach
Ellis-Hayden sent a cross into
the box that a cluster of Pitt de-
fenders cleared, but the ball went
straight to Hart, who snuck a
shot inside the post to win the
game. , ’

It was Hart’s second goal of
the season.

“It’s unfortunate,” Luffy said.
“They got a lucky bounce there
at the end and put it away. We
had chances that we didn’t put
away. It happens.”

The tally capped 15 minutes of
strong offensive pressure from
Cleveland State, which swung
momentum in its favor late in
regulation. In the 85th minute,
Clevelandjunior forward Aaron
Adkins chipped the ball over
Johnston to the left of the goal,
but Pitt defender Robert Iledare
backed up his keeper and kicked
away the ball at the line.

The teams finished even in
shots, 12-12.

“We played well throughout
the entire game,” senior defend-
er Shane Flowers said after the
loss. “I think we just attacked
really hard and just wore our-
selves down.” I ‘

considered real contenders for the
conference title, they need to pick
up a win at Rutgers this weekend.

3. South Florida — After failing
to show up at Pitt, the Bulls (4-1, 0-1
Big East) head into a much needed
bye week. Their impressive early
season performancesshowed that
the Bulls have all the talent to com-
pete fora Big East title, but their
performance against the Panthers
is worrisome. Quarterback B.]. Dan-
iels and the Bulls defense will have
an extra week to ﬁgure things out
before they head to Connecticut for
a must-win game next weekend.

4. Rutgers — The Scarlet Knights
(3-1, 1-0 Big East) make their ﬁrst
appearance in the top half of my
standings after they picked up a cru-

cial win at Syracuse’ this weekend.
After playing horrendously on of-
fense for three quarters, Rutgers in-
serted freshman quarterback Gary
Nova, who led a 10-point comeback
to get the game to overtime where
the Scarlet Knights eventually pre-
vailed. ‘Despite having extremely
low expectations coming into 2011,
if Rutgers can pick up a win when
they host Pitt on Saturday, the Scar-
let Knights could be real contenders
in the race for the Big East title.

5. Cincinnati — The offense has
put up big numbers all season for
the Bearcats (4-1, 0-0 Big East), but
it was the defense grabbing head-
lines this weekend as Cincinnati
shut out Miami (Ohio) 27-0 on the
road. It will be interesting to see
how the Bearcats, who get a bye this

week, will fare once Big East play
begins for them next week against
Louisville.

6. Syracuse + The Orange’s
close—game luck ﬁnally ran out
'with the double overtime loss to
Rutgers Saturday. Syracuse (3-2,
0-1 Big East) blew a 10-point lead
and turned over the ball ﬁve times
in its conference opener. Now the
Orange head to Tulane for an inter-

1 esting matchup that will serve as
' preparation for possibly the biggest

game of their season —- an Oct. 21
showdown with West Virginia at
the Carrier Dome.

7. Connecticut — The Huskies

gan’s passing game this weekend

Coach Graham said. “One thing that impressed ‘

me is that [running backs] Coach Magee and
I had worked with Ray on what he could im-
prove on, and he actually worked on it and

1 got better.”

The Scarlet Knights have their own stand—
out player on offense in Mohamed Sanu. The
junior wide receiver already has 43 receptions
for428 yards and ﬁve touchdowns on the 2011
season. He ran the ball 59 times in 2010 and
62 inhis freshman year 2009. ,

In his ﬁrst year stepping back from doing it

alloifensively for Rutgers, he has made great ' '
- V strides as a receiver. 6 P . ‘

“Sanu has tremendous skills,” Gra-
ham said. “They move him aroulndquite a bit-

. so you can’t isolate ‘him. He has tremendous ‘

ability. He is able to contort his body and go
get balls and make oneihanded catches. He
is a strong-handed guy and no question he is
their go-to guy. He is the guy that you have to
know where he is at all times.”

Pitt’s defense showed vast improvements

_ despite losses in Iowa and at home against

Notre Dame, but the defensive squad put ev-
erything together in the win overthe Bulls.
’ “We imposed our will,” Alecxih said af-

ter, theﬂgame. “I just felt for the ﬁrst time all

season we clicked as a defense. We were able
to do exactly what we wanted. There was no-
body doing their own thing. We just came
together.” »—

’ The talented receivers from Rutgers will
post a challenge for the Panthers’ defense.

  7 ; S66.
Vl(e just thought that if wecame

   Mohamed Sanu leads Scarlet Knights’ receivers

up against is the best, but Mohamed Sanu is a
special receiver,” Graham said. “The strength
of Rutgers’ offense would probably be their
receiving corps. They have very skilled players
and big 6-foot-4 receivers who can go up and
get the football.”

  In and executed ouroffense,
we could score some points.
  S -—Tino Sunseri

Led by Sanu, the Scarlet Knights are deep
at the position. Eight different.players made
catches in their 19-16 double-overtime win
against the Orange. ‘ V
d “We have played against a lot of great re-
ceivers. Each week you think the one you are

Although the Scarlet Knights have plenty
of talented receivers, there’s currently a battle
for which quarterback is going to get them
the ball.

Sophomore Chas Dodd, Rutgers’ starter all
season, was pulled in the third quarter against

9

Syracuse. He was 14-31 for 166 yards and one
interception when he was replaced by a player

' whose name that might be familiar to Pitt fans,

freshman Gary Nova. .5

Nova, a verbal commit to Pitt before
Wannstedt’s resignation, led the Rutgers’
comeback, going 14-22 for 122' yards and one
touchdown. _

“I haven’t made a decision about that,”
Schiano said of the quarterbacks. “I’ll make
a decision when I’m ready to make it. I don’t
know when that’s going to be.”

Pitt’s own quarterback,-junior Tino Sunseri,
quieted critics against South Florida, looking
comfortable in connecting on 22—of-33 passes
for 216 yards and a touchdown.

Sunseri and his offense know what it takes
to execute Graham's system. The Panthers will
look to build on the performance against the
Bulls now that they have awell-executed game
under their belts. ‘

_e “We just thought that if we came in and
executed our offense, we could score some
points,” Sunseri said after the win. “It’s very
pleasing to see it done. A lot of people have
been talking about how it’s coming and how
we’ve been getting closer and closer. We ﬁnally
did it, and we know what it feels like now.” I

Ray Graham
Offensive
Player of the
Week

Big East 4 8

as UConn(2-3, 0-0 Big East) disappointingly
dropped a back—and-forth 38-31 shootout at
home. Close games have been unkind to the
Huskies this season, as all of their losses have
come by seven points or fewer. But an upset on
the road against West Virginia this weekend
would put the Huskies right back on track.
8. Louisville — Coming off of a good win at
Kentucky and a bye week, the Cardinals (2-2,

‘ 0-0 Big East) suffered a huge letdown at home

this weekend by dropping a 17-13 game to
Marshall. After the Kentucky upset, I thought
head coach Charlie Strong’s team might be
able to make some noise in the Big East this
year, but this young squad might‘ struggle
through along season if its inconsistent ﬁrst
four games are anything to go by.

Offensive Player of the Week: Ray Gra-
ham, Running Back, Pittsburgh — Graham ran
through, over and around South Florida this
weekend in a 309-all—purpose—yards, two-
touchdown performance which had Panther
fans, college football analysts and NFL scouts

’ all amazed by the ball carrier’s talent. If Pitt

can string a few wins together and Graham
continues to put up ridiculous numbers, he
could be the Panthers’ ﬁrst real Heisman Tro-
phy contender since Larry Fitzgerald.

Defensive Player of the Week: Steve Beau-
harnais, Linebacker, Rutgers — Pitt safety
Jarred Holley was a strong contender, but
Beauharnais takes it after tallying two sacks
and a fourth-quarter interception in the Scar-
let Knights’ overtime win at Syracuse. Rutgers
leads the nation in turnovers and Beauharnais
is a big reason why. i 1. ,

Coach of the Week: Todd Graham, Pitts-
burgh — Coming off two straight losses, Gra-
ham’s Panthers responded in their conference
opener and dominated USF with the most
impressive performance by aVBig East team
all season. It’s obvious that Graham made it
part of the game plan to get the ball to running
back Ray Graham, and the Panthers should
ﬁnd success if they continue to do that for the
rest of the season.

What to watch for in week six: Showdown
in Piscataway — With Pitt and Rutgers both
ﬂying high after winning their ﬁrst confer-
ence games, this week’s game could go along
way toward fulﬁlling both team’s Big East
title ambitions. Running back Ray Graham

returns to his home state, and I’m predicting ‘

that he’ll carry the Panthers once again to a
convincing victory. 3 ’
