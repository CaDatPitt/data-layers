By VICKI EPSTEIN ‘

Hawthorne House, in con-
junction with Men’s Dormi-
tory ‘Council (MDC), held a
Forum Monday entitled "‘En-
counter” with Eric Stern,
Student Government (SG)
president; Bill Cabin, editor of
The Pitt News; Rick Schweder,
SG senator; and Jim Smith, for-
mer social events chairman -of
SG.

Ted Blair, moderator and head
counselor of Hawthorne House,
said, “These four men are here
primarily to present their ideas
 to you on what they feel the role
of SG is on the University cam-
pus.”

Each participant opened with
a ﬁve minute statement on “What
is the role of SG on the Univer-
sity Campus?”

  rents Various SG‘ Views

Hawthorne

" ‘Stern said that in “any Univer-
sity-, SG should be the voice of
the students. SG should be firm.”

“As, students we have a priv-
ileged place in society and it is

necessary to live up to ‘the re-"

sponsibilities of this. This means
using the free time that we have
for social issues, for social re-
sponsibilities, and above all else,
because only free men can make
.other men free, to be free our-
selves. This I think is the major
role today in S6} in the Universi-
ty: tohelp students become free;

‘to help students assert them-

selves." ‘

.Stern advocated changing the ’

SGN constitution. “I see no reason
Why" students as mature adults

shouldn’t be able to control al- -

most completely nonacademic
areas. SG should be the‘ students’
bargaining agent on campus and

should become a more mature re-
sponsible organization. Mature
meaning willing, not to be chil-
dren,' but to (take chances, to
make bold statements on all sorts
of issues whether they beissues
fdr freedom in Vietnam or issues
for freedom here, in the Univer-
sity.”

Cabin presented his ideal view
with SG as an integral part of
a wheel (anyone involved in the
University). The function of SG.

he thought, is to both legislate .

and recommend issues concern-
ing students and all those other
functionaries at the University.
SG should be able to recommend
things to the faculty, to the ad-
ministration, and to the board of
trustees, and vice versa.”
“The crux of the issue is a
contradiction between the SG

book on the Student Affairs-Com-
,,-fmittee,” Cabin said. He quoted
S the handbook’s description of the
Student Affairs Committee as a
committee to study campus life
and make recommendations on
‘—‘objectives .and appraisal of stu-
dent organizations and activities;
'5’ the structure and responsibilities
 of SG; official approval of stu-

_—'continuance of official recogni-
tion; identiﬁcation of areas in

_sions or decisions; and general

., Smith said that “SG should
_~.ha've power over the activities of
the students but I do not agree
A over some of the policies and the
Jway the SG is acting this past

semester and the past year.”

” “. . . SG should mirror, formu-
‘-‘L late and discuss any policy which
“will beneﬁt the greatest majority
of " students.” He wanted closer
communication between the vice-
.. ' _~_ presidents of Student Affairs

‘ ‘ on SG; a restructuring of ballot-
ng and voting procedure; and an
—-_ active SG during the spring tri-
mester.

?For Young Republicans

‘State and local Republican Party leaders will speak and
‘answer questions at the Student Union Lower Lounge Fri-
day at noon, as part of Young Republican Week at Pitt.

 Principal speaker will be W. Stuart Helm, secretary of
 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Other speakers in-
' lclude: Vincent Rovitto, Pittsburgh GOP mayorality candi-

He served as chairman of the
Republican Policy Committee in
the House from 1959 to 1962, and
president of the National Legisla-

was also special assistant to Gov-
ernor William W. Scr.anton from
January, 1965, to June, 1965. He
was sworn in as Secretary of the

SG Role, Powers, Status

vice-presidents on SG. The only
group that is on Student Affairs
Committee but not in SG.is The
Pitt News.

Question one was “Which fac-
tor should be decisive in case of
conﬁict:\the personal convictions
of the student leader or the wish-
es of the majority of the body
that herepresents?”

Cabin answered that the lead-
er should represent the majority.
of students, and the senator,his
individual convictions if he feels
they are right. Smith believes in
relying on the students. Schweder
said, “SG is the sole representa-
tive of the student body.” Stern
felt, “I do represent the students
although a majority of students
didn’t vote.” ‘

Question two: “What is your
recommendation for allocation of
the ‘students activities fee?”

Smith favored members of
both SG and Student Affairs Com-
mittee for the Student Alloca-
tions Committee. Schweder was
in favor of SG allocating the
activities fee as was Stern. Cab-
in wanted two members from
SG, two from the Student Affairs
Committee, Vice-Chancellor of
Student Affairs and SG financial
advisor. .

Question three: “What is wrong
with having the manner of allo-
cation of the student activities
fee. decided by referendum?” ,

Schweder saw the referendum
as a challengeto the administra-
tion;- Stern asked what was wrong
with the referendum and an-
swered “not a goddamn thing”;
Cabin said that if a student ref-
erendum. is called for “let the

students come out and vote for

the referendum than they did
for SG president”; and Simth
said, “Your referendum isn't go-
ing to "prove a goddamn thing.”

A lively ‘question and answer
period followed the Forum dis-
cussion.

 

 

Drew   University Professor     
Declares Vietcong Support

NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (CPS)
—-A political science instructor
at Drew University who declared
his support for the Vietcong if
the U.S. continues its current
policy in Vietnam, now faces
possible dismissal.

James Mellon, a teacher at
Drew and co-director of the Free
University of New York, spoke at
an all-night teach-in on civil lib-
erties and academic freedom at
Rutgers University last Wednes-

I day (Sept. 29). “As a professed

Marxist and Socialist, I do not
hesitate to state my position,” he
said. “I stand side by side with
Professor Genovese—I don't fear

a Vietcong victory in Vietnam; I
welcome it.”

Eugene Genovese is the Rutgers
professor who last spring came
under attack in the state «legisla-
ture for supporting the Vietcong
at a teach-in on Vietnam. The
Rutgers administration refused to
ﬁre Genovese.

The president of Drew, Robert
Oxnam, immediately charged that
Mellon’s speech ..was “irresponsi-
ble,” and said on Thursday he
would call for a faculty commit-
tee to P‘ reconsider Mellon’s con-
tract with the University.

The Rutgers teach-in was spon-
sored by the Committee for Free

Speech, organized during the
summer as a result of the Geno-
vese incident last semester. Its
marathon teach-in, which went
from 10 p.m. to 6 the next morn-
ing, was to have dealt with aca-
demic freedom in the United
States, but many of the lectures
also hit at U.S. policy in Vietnam.

Prof. Staughton Lynd of Y.ale,
one of the leaders of the teach-
in movement against the war in
Vietnam, said that he too shared
Prof. Genovese’s views. Com-
menting that he was about to
speak- “seditiously,” Lynd said,
“if -the U.S. neither grants the
elections (in South Vietnam) or
leaves, the National Liberation
Front should prevail.”

Public Health Conducts
Internal Med. Survey

Researchers at the University Graduate School of Pub-
lic Health have conducted a survey on internal medicine and
the average intern’s private practice at the request of the
New York State Society of Internal Medicine. This survey,
which was recently published by the Journal of the Ameri-
can Medical Association, was ﬁnanced with a grant from the

.U.S. Public Health Service. The

reports used in_the survey were
based on information collected
from 500 of the Society’s mem-
bers.

The researchers conducting this
survey were Dr. Hilda I-L Kroeg-
er, Dr. Isidore Altman, Dr. Dean
A. Clark, and Dr.:Allen C. John-
son. Also participating was Dr.
Cecil G. Sheps, currently asso-
ciated with the Beth Israel Medi-
cal Center of New York.

The University survey showed
that internists, spec-ialists in the
treatment of diseases in adults,
spend slightly more than 35 hours
a week caring for their private
patients. In addition, they donate
an estimated ten hours a week
to volunteer activities, profession-
al meetings and conferences, and
continuing education and re-
search. The avenage ‘internist
makesfive house calls each week,
and examines an additional 55
patients at his office and 25 in
hospitals.

Over two-thirds of the intern-
ists said they schedule 45 to 90
minutes for the examination of .a
new office patient. Additional vis-
its will not be as long, but the
study indicated that the average
of all initial and recurring visits
was 25: minutes.

The University study indicated
that most new patients choose a
doctor because. a friend or rela-
tive has recommended him or be-
cause the patients, themselves,
think they are in need of medi-
cal attention. One-third are re-
ferred to the internists by gen-
eral practitioners and specialists.

More than half of all new pa-
tients seen by the internists are
retained for continuing care.
Eighteen per cent are returned
to the doctor who originally re-
ferred them. Fourteen per cent
need no further treatment, and 11
per cent are sent to other spe-
cialists.

legalism; Senator Rich Schweder, paternalism.

The issue culminated in the referendum which Schweder will pro-
pose at tomorrow’s SG meeting: a student referendum that the activities
fee allocations committee be composed of either two students selected by .
Student Affairs (SA) and two by SG or a committee with ﬁve SG-selected
members. It culminated, however, not before the forum had degenerated
into what Monday’s editorial had warned against: emotional, personal

' conflict.

It was a strange type of conﬁict. Where each member had attended
to present his views, Cabin was suddenly representing The Pitt News edi-
torial board and the administration against Stern and Schweder as the stu-
dents. Cabin should not have been made to debate the paper’s stand; but

allowed to present his opinion as a student leader.

_ Stern agreed to the two and two committee in April although, he
. claims, under pressure. That was more of the time for a student referen-
dum than now. Now Stern has already illegally vetoed the measure and
lost the right of SG approval of committee members and appropriations.
' Cabin pointed out that the duties assigned to SA shou1d_be desig-
nated to Student Government. Already member organizations overlap and,
in fact, those students on the Student Affairs Committee are more closely
related-« to the‘ students they represent than are CSG senators. The senators
only real relation is by school. '
It is, however, not the time to discuss w
or should havebeen. There is $25,000 awaiting to be allocated.

Stern and Schweder-are asking SG senators to abdicate their posi-
tions as representatives and go directly to the students (in a measure SG

has once defeated), believeing all legal. means have been blocked.

The issue of the role of Student Government (SG) and the student
activities fee at Monday's night’-s forum turned into the larger issue of
stu-dent versus administration. Editor Bill ' Cabin called the latter issue

to fully inform the students.

A referendum should not be necessary. SG has accepted the orig
inal proposal. Responsible debate, unlike that at the forum, and selection;
of eligible students should make way for the reestablishment of the righ
to approve recommendations. Such a compromise would not, in Stern_’_s7.

If the administration, and more speciﬁcally Vice-Chancellor of Stu-

dent Affairs Helen Rush, are so interested in “compromising our way; ._
‘not at all” no show of students would have any effect. Such would see
the case by Scwheder and Stern’s‘argumént. S G - q ‘ 
It is difficult to believe that the administration can be is so oveil

Administrative help is necessary.‘ At least one member of the administra-»
tion (Vice-Chancellor of Student Affairs) should be on the committee. The;
students cannot take the allocation of the $25,000 completely into thei

Hick Blamed 
On University

Editor, The, Pitt News:
Hobie Harris’ story on the Frick
Fine Arts Building, while‘ clear-
’ ing up some of the clouds of the
controversy, failed to emphasize
certain aspects of the issue which
I feel deserve further considera-
tion. ‘ *
Harris states that the building

’ was not meant to be “a ‘general

class building,” that “the build-
ing’ was originally‘ planned by
Helen Clay Frick and the .admin-
‘istrationras a ﬁne arts center for
both the University and the _city--.’.’
Non-ﬁne arts classes were sched-
uled there only as a last resort,
due to a lack of classroom space.
My first question is: Why wasn’t
there enough room? Before the
Frick Building was available, the
University had sufficient space
for "classes. With the opening of

_ the Frick‘ Building, th’e_i"e is a

lack of space. Somehow, this does

 not logically follow. Perhaps the

University had better terminate
its building_ program —— by the
time it is completed, we may
have no classroom space .at all.

It could’ be argued that an in-
crease in incoming freshmen and
number of courses offered created
,an extraordinary situation. A In-
deed they did, but why was this
allowed to occur? Is it Universi-

\ty policy to admit record -num-A

. bers of students, offer more

The 

tcourixses, and worry about class-
room facilities later? Th
in this system, if this be it, has
become strikingly evident.

But according to Harris, the
shortage of space was alleviated
and condemned classes were ex-
pelled from the Promised Land.

us. If the situation was corrected
as‘ reported, then why were class-

a-large University as this is, the
administration deemed it neces-
sary to use private facilities out-
side, the University for classes.
The University, after relying
for‘years on federal‘ and state
assistance, seems to be .continu-
ing the trend. Where will it end?
Will the residents of Oakland be
visited some day by an emissary
of the Chancellor, requesting the
use of their living rooms for
classes between the hours of 8
am. and 5 p.rn:’Monday through
Friday- except for holidays ‘and
blizzards?  ’ ” 
But once the need for using
non-University facilities as a
crutch is acquiesced, another
question arises. If it was so easy

to juggle classrooms now, why‘

wasn’t this done then, when Miss
Frick’s “Decrees Concerning the
Use of My Building” V were‘ is-
sued? A lot of difficulty could
have been prevented. it

It should be clear, then, "that
Miss Frick is not the major cause
of the confused situation,‘ al-
though she does bear ultimate re-
sponsibility for the class restrict-.
tion.‘ It must be made abundant-
ly clear that it is altogether pro-
per for the donor of such .a gift
to specify how that gift shall be
used. The University knew the
restrictions and accepted them.

Harris’ story corre‘ctly places
the blame for the chaos right on
the doorstep of the administra-
tion of this University. It was
they who accepted Miss Frick’s
stipulations but refused to. sched-
ule classes within the framework
of those limitations.

America spends $3 billion annually to ‘

dispose of the half-billion pounds of gar-
bage which accumulates every day of the
year. Approximately one-third of tlpis rub-
bish somehow finds its Way to the Pitt
News office in the form of junk mail.

Not only is the quantity of this trash
amazing but the fact that there are enough
i degenerate minds
around to conceive of
it and believe it is
somewhat frighten-

ing. -
SURELY qualify-
ing as the most hein-
ous and bigoted propa-
ganda ever received
by the paper is the

»  ..  ..  - material sent out by
  '  "To the National States
Euro ' ‘ Rights Party which
labels itself as a “patriotic political Party”
whose goal is to “defeat the un-American,
diabolic Jew-Communist‘ conspiracy which de-
sires to force racial intermarriage and this pro-
duce a race of docile, simple-minded mulattoes

who will be obedient to their Jewish masters.”

    

To “prove” its point of Negro inferior-
ity-the leaflet pictures two identical draw-
ings, the only difference between the two is
that one is labeled “The Ape’_’ while the
other one is labeled “The Negro.” The “sci-
entific proof” of Negro inferiority cited in-

cludes such comparisons to the ape as.
. “animal wool” hair, “small brain,” and “ani-

mal smell.-f’ The fact that anyone who hasn't
had _a bath lately has that locker room odor
‘(Dial soap to the contrary) doesn’t seem to
enter, the picture here. '

SOME or the wittier sections of the Na-

tional States‘ Rights Party’ plea for White, A

“Christian” superiority are found in What
must be selections written by the Devil's
Poet Laureate. “On any issue before, you
choose,” it urges, “check for influence of
the Jews.” Another verse. which isentitled

On the other side of the ideological fence
' The Worker provides the News staff with
periodic entertainment. A. three __ column
front page cartoon in a recent issue "shows
an American GI with smoke pouring out of
the barrel of his machine gun as he stands
over the bodies of two Vietnemese women
and a dead baby. A grim faced President
Johnson stands in the foreground asfan
. American jet fires rockets while a group), of
marines burn a village hut. The caption
says “News item: Johnson says he is abid-
ing by the humanitarian principles ofthie

‘ 1949 Geneva Conventions.” 5 ’

THE WORKER,‘ which is no longerdail-y
because “The Worker needs funds now,”. 
an editorial says: “It is a warning to us 

_ cans, especially, that the fruit of aggression’is;a-
bitter fruit,” and goes" on to say that history
f‘counsels us to bring to bear the full weight

' our will for peace upon (not Moscow, Peking
or Havana, of course, but) the government in
Washington and President Johnson . _. .” 

Another gem of profound wisdom comes
to us from the Youth Against War and ,.
Fascism. What war? Why the war in" Viet-

lic, of course. And what fascism ? The “neo-
_fascist conspirators in Washington,” what
else? And why are they fighting? .“In order:
to protect the far—flung_ empire of the ‘United

By FRANK SMIZIK
Sports Editor
Paul Martha was on the
lips of every West Virginia
fan after the Panthers de-
feated the Mountaineers, 10-
7, two years ago. Garret

Ford was on the lips of every
West Virginia fan before the
game began this year. When the
game was over Saturday, Eric
Crabtree had some appropriate
epithets thrown his way, also.

Crabtree was playing in the
shadow of Ford before the game
started. Ford had two runs of 60
yards or better in the two pre-
vious games. He started the Moun-
taineers off well when he ran 63
yards to set up the ﬁrst touch-'
down-. Crabtree had carried the
ball three times and gained only
four yards as the Panthers fell
behind, 21-0.

,The second half whistle must
have awakened Crabtree because
he was unstoppable. He caught a
43 yard touchdown pass. He ran
a kickoff back 92 yards and ran
'71 yards from the line of scrim-
mage for another TD.

“I had fantastic blocking on
the kickoff returns,” said Crab-‘
tree. Dale Stewart took out two
guys and Fred Hoaglin got the
ﬁnal man. I could have trotted
over the goal line with the block-
ing I got.

“I still can’t believe that West
Virginia game,” Crabtree went
on. “I don’t know if anyone
knows how they scored so much
or how we scored so often, I
sure don’t.”

,. . . Page is  rrrr News —— Wednesday. October 6, 1965

j Crabtree Brings Memories of Martha in 1963

It is hard to compare Crabtree
to Ford because of the difference
in size and running styles. Ford
is 6-foot-3, 210 pounds, while
Crabtree is only 5-foot-11 and 180
pounds. Crabtree is a swive1-hip-
ped speedster, while Ford is big

enough to run through a man,‘

;-».¢r'.'

ERIC CRABTREE about to be sprung loose on his
92 yard touchdown run. Dale Stewart and Tom
Raymond on left lead blocking as Crabtree awaits

but also fast enough to run
around him.

Crabtree who has faced both
Floyd Little from Syracuse and
Ford, thinks the West Virginia
back is the better of the two.
“I’ve seen both of them play and
I would say without any doubt

 

scrimmage.

an opening for him to go through. The return tied

the score at 42-42. Crabtree also scored towndowns
on a 43 yard pass play and a 71 yard run from

that Ford is a better ball carrier
than Little.”

Safetyman Joe Pohl has other
observations about the great col-
legiate runners. “I’ve tackled

some of the best backs in the
country and I haven’t found any
harder to bring down than Crab-

tree. He’s so slippery that he’s
P8311)’ rough for me to bring
down in the scrimmages.”

So far this season Michelosen
hasn’t chosen to run Crabtree
from the line of scrimmage too
often. He has been used most
often as a ﬂanker back. A

“I really don’t care what I do
on offense as long as I get a
chance to score. I enjoy catch-
ing passes and I guess all run-
ners enjoy going from scrim-
mage. I don’t like catching punts
though, those big men coming
down fast under a punt while
you’re standing there waiting for
it to come down doesn’t really
appeal to me.”

One thing that does appeal to
Crabtree is playing pro ball. “I
don’t know where I would play
or who I would play for, the big
thing is just being invited to play
which I feel is quite an honor.”

Crabtree could get a chance to
play anywhere with the pros be-
cause of his versatility. “I played
a lot of defense when ‘I was a
sophomore because we had Mar-
tha and Bill Bodle in the ﬁrst
team backﬁeld. I’ve played of-
fense the last two years.”

West Virginia will remember
that Crabtree played oﬂfense,
Panther fans will remember
that Crabtree played offense, Pan-
ther fans will remember Crab-
tree played offense, and the stat-
isticians in the press box will be
so busy compiling the yardage
he accumulates, they won’t be
able to forget that Eric Crabtree
was the Panthers top offensive
threat in the 1965- season.

Pohl Shows Confidence
In Gridder Comeback

_ By TOM SACKS

Safetyman Tippy Pohl saw so many footballs ﬂying by
in last Saturday’s 63-48 loss to West Virginia he must have
surely wondered whether the defense was preferable to his

old position as quarterback.

Pohl and junior Ed James shared the quarterbacking
duties when freshmen. Last year with Fred Mazurek and

Kenny Lucas both in front of
James and Pohl, the coaches de-
cided that Pohl would be more
useful on defense. In his new
position he played 240 minutes
while James was seeing only ﬁve
minutes of offensive action.

“I wouldn't trade defense for
anything,” said Pohl. “It’s more
of a challenge. When I found out
I couldn’t make it as quarter-
back I had ﬁrst hoped to be a
linebacker. But I didn’t have the
size and now I’m glad of it.”

If Pohl is really glad to be

separated from the bruising hit-
ting close to the line it couldn't
be veriﬁed by his ﬁeld play. He
has been in on as many plays
close to the line of scrimmage as
he has been back in open terri-
tory. .
“If I see a running play def-
initely forming, then I get up
there as soon as possible,” said
Pohl. “I just have to be sure I’m
not over anxious.”

Against West Virginia, Pohl
had no time to be over anxious.

He was too busy trying to decide‘

whether to be amazed or discour-
aged. “Have you ever been in .a
train station watching the trains
go in and out. That's the way it
was on the ﬁeld. I had to keep
turning my head right and left.

“Most of the plays were going
to the corners and not over the
middle. It seemed like by the
time I got to one side another
play had already formed on the
other side." /

The Panther defense is keyed
to teamwork. By judging the

yardage and down, a feeling for
the upcoming play can. usually
be gathered. The defense then
forms a perimeter with lines of
primary defense.

“I don’t even think a perimeter
existed Saturday,” said Pohl.
“Everybody has his job on de-
fense. But there were too many
mental lapses.” According to Pohl
one lapse can mean a touchdown";

Judging by this, the defense must -

have been sleeping Saturday. ’
‘‘It’s a strange feeling being
dqwnﬁeld trying to tackle the
ball carrier when he has three
blockers in front of him. I couid-
n’t believe the scoreboard. But
they nan through the movies the
other day and it was all true.

Fortunately for the gridders

their schedule is so tough they‘

don’t have that much time to
think of past games. Next week,
they play Duke, which has a 3-0
record. .

In the next seven games the
Panther defense will be playing
against some of the best backs in
the country. In time, the memory
of Mountaineer sophomore Gar-
rett Ford, who gained 192 yards
Saturday, "will fade.

“At least the defense is gain-
ing experience. We'll, probably
never have another chance to see
so many different plays,” said
Pohl.

“Ford was good, but he always
had good blocking. We'll be fac.
ing some tough «backs, but I
think we can handle them.

I.

Soccer Team’s Offense

Needs Scoring Threat

By GEORGE LIES

So far this season, the

soccer team continues to be a

team which moves the ball on offense, but also a team which
lacks a top notch scoring threat.
‘ “This team can advance the ball against any team in

the country,” said coach Leo Bemis” .

. . but so far we

haven’t culminated our offensive drives with goals.” So this

week, Bemis plans to improve
the offense with a new system.
“Basically, we'll use the same

9 offense, but this week, our wing

will practice more driving
straight-on a defensive man than
passing the ball in front of the
goal”

“This sort of offense is used
in basketball, where the good
dribbler can evade a defender
and shoot. We need a scorer, so
when a wing passes into the cen-
ter, we’re going to give it right
back to him, and let him try and
go through for the score,” said
Bemis. .

In order to get by an opponent,
a soccer player must be able to
handle the ball. Bemis’ booters
have their ball-handlers. “One the
line, Pete Snyder, along with
halfback Vince Bartalotta are
good driblers who will be work-
ing on driving in and and shoot-
ing,”,Bemis said. .

At the wing positions, the soc-
cer team ran into a plague of in-
juries. First Aldo Zortea wrench-
ed his knee, missing the Frost-
burg game. Then in the West
Chester contest, Al Traunsteiner
threw a cartilage out of place
and is lost for the entire sea-
son. .

“Aldo’s knee still isn’t sound so
we’re letting him take a few days
off each week until he can go
full tilt. Running on the leg did-
n’t help any, but he’ll jog around
a day or two before the Kent
State game. As for Traunsteiner,

he is through,” said Bemis.

“No one can say we won’t miss
Al, but right now, we have ad-
justed to his loss,” Bemis said.
Two sophomores, Gary Foertsch
and Bob Racunas, ﬁlled Traun-
steiner’s vacant left wing spot
while Sal T.avares moved ahead
of the now slowed down Zortea.

Fresh Beaters Improv
Before Season Begins ?

By LAWRENCE’ DAVIS

A good attitude and a lot of conditioning is the basis “o 

a good ball team an-d that’s what freshman soccer coae
Bob McNulty believes he has this year. ‘ ’
“There aren’t any outstanding players, just one s
team,” commented coach McNulty. A -V 
“The team this year will consist mainly of a lot of ha‘ 

working youngsters who have lit-
tle or no previous soccer experi-
ence, but a great deal of desire
for a winning season. Their pr.ac-
tice began ‘early in September
and the boys are constantly im-
proving,’.’: said McNulty.

The frosh squad ‘opened their

season yesterday with an away
game against Slippery Rock. Last-

year the frosh team split with
Slippery Rockrlosing, 2-1, in the
ﬁrst and winning, 2-1, in the
second. ,

“If the team will use their skill
to the fullest, I’m _sure no one

will kick us -around the ﬁeld,”

said McNulty. .

The only player here on schol-
arship is Dave Shimpeno, the
brother of George Shimpeno, a
varsity star last year. Therestof
the team is trying to earn theirs.

The fresh squad will be out to
better the 3-2 record attained
by last year's freshman team.

“The defense will have to jell
in order to have a good team,”
stated McNulty. 9

‘The team will be playing with
a full squad, with only minor
injuries after weeks of practice.
