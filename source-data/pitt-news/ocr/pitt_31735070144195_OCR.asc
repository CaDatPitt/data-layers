ago by the United Nations, and the
current state of aﬂiairs domestically and
abroad.

“In the US today, people are still

"They needed to articulate the bot-

Thus, the UN assembled a list of
rights including those of life,  se-
curity and 

“Most people think of human
rights as  somewhere else,”
said Neylon.

However, she went onto explain
that these rights exist in the US and in-

However, Neylon also spoke about
the ways in which every person can
work toward the realization of the Uni-

son to educate himself, involve himself

STS9 blasts off the dance floor

by Justin Jacobs
Ac§E Editor

Sound Tribe Sector 9

Tonight, 8
Mr. Sma|l's
Millvale
$90

The music of Sound Tribe Sec-
tor 9 is what you might expect from
the band’s name -—— straight from
-outer space. , V

The quintet, usually called STS9,
plays the type of jam-heavy, syn-
thed-out space rock that would be
at home both at an earthly dance
party and a rave on Mars, with long-
form improvisation over a constant
and pounding dance beat In other
words, if your idea of  is hip-
swiveling in an Oakland basement,
get ready to redeﬁne what it means
to get down. _

If that weren’t interesting enough
for you, STS9 pulls it all off without
any words. The band’s live shows,
which often run for up to four hours,
keep crowds moving with all instru-
mental grooves. And those crowds
keep getting bigger. Since STS9 re-

leased its latest record, Peaoelaézrter, '

this past summer, the band’s follow-
ing has been larger than ever. 0

STS9 drummer Zach Velmer
called from the train to talk with The

Pitt News.

The Pitt News: People go nuts
for your live show. What is it about
a Sound Tribe performance that you
think makes people so excited?

Zach Velmer: You never lmow-

what you’re  to get, and that
excites people There’s a level of
innigue. We consciously push our-
selves as the artists and musicians
to create that mystique. People do
know, though, that thefre going
to get a show. It’s lights, it’s sounds,
[and] it’s a dance party.

TPN: I once picked up a hitch-
hiker on the way to a show in Cleve-

land, and he was going to a Sound _

Tribe show that was on the way. He
offered me a quartz crystal as thanks
for the ride. How would you describe
your fans?

ZV: The}/re way too varied. In a
college town, we’ll get the young hip-
pies. In a metropolitan area we’ll get
the 30-somethings coming out We
get the hipsters. I’ve stopped 
to ﬁgure it out, honestly. The only
way our fans are uniﬁed is that they
love, love live music ‘

TPN: How is Peaoeb/aster ‘a
growth from your previous material?

ZV: It’s a no—brainer for us, 
the sense of our focus and attention
behind this record. Comparatively

speaking, our other records are all .

over the place We started this record
in Halloween of last year and ﬁn-
ished it in May. Our last record took

two years to record, and itwas made

in basements, hotel rooms [and]
backs of buses. For Peaoeo/a.n‘er, it was
all in the studio, all focused.

TPN: Is STS9’s songwriting a
formal processor are songs based
on a groove? '

ZV: It’s ﬁve of us, [and] we all
contribute The song is not done un-
til we’ve all touchediit. We’re a ﬁve-
moving-as-one deal.

TPN: Where does Sound Tribe
ﬁt in with the  band scene? Do
you "at all? -

ZV: Ithink we have a huge rel-
evancy — our ticket sales and album
sales show that To me, though, to be
perfectly honest, it’s a phenomenon.
No one knows who the f**k we are.
It’s a trip to me that I can sit on a

, plane or a train and no one knows

who the hell we are, and yet we’re
selling out 3,000 capacity venues. But
if someone could explain it to me,
I’d love that ‘ t

The i7: a processor

smarter than you  

by Donald Campbell
Cola/nm}/t

The Al\/ID/ Intel wars, in which
AMD Athlons and Intel Pentiums
were pushing 3.5 GHz, are over

Intel decided at that juncture that
smarter was the best way to go. Its
answer to the problem was to add an-
other core to the processor. The Pen-

? tium Dual-Core and then the Core

series of processors allowed Intel to

boost the speed by processing more

efﬁciently, rather than by 
Intel recentlyannounced that it

has gotten even smarter than the

Core series Intel’s new architecture,
the i7, will provide greater process-

ing capabilities at approximately the

same price as the Core series Cou-
pled with a better chipset and more
advanced storage technology, Intel
promises that the i7 architecture will
ultimately boost the performance of
both home and business computers
considerably.

What’s so special about the i7?
It corrects a fundamental problem
with the Core series architecture The
Front Side Bus, or FSB, of the Core
series, prevented ‘the processor from
successfully  its ﬁill perfor-
mance potential The FSB provides
a way for the processor to commu-
nicate with the main memory. If the
FSB of a processor is inefﬁcient, even
the fastest processors will be slowed.

We encounter this type of prob-
lem constantly —with snail mail. No
matter how efficient one individual
might be with his job, he cannot com-
plete it if he is constantly  for
a package to meander its way through
the US. Postal Service.

The Core series processors sit
around constantly  for data
to meander its way through the FSB
from the main memory to the pro-
cessofs on—chip memory— its cache
— where it can be used efﬁciently
and  for processing.

The i7 architecture contains four V

individual processing cores If Intel

had its old-style FSB, the i7"

would spend a similarly worthless

.amount of time  around star-

 

ing. off into space. Intel invented a
new way to handle its memory com-
munications for the i7, however. Intel
placed a memory controller unit on-
chip, along with the four cores and
their cache memories _

The i7 also gives_ each core inde-
pendent L1 and L2 ‘caches, with an
additional, shared L3 cache. Every
piece of data present in the cores’ in-
dividual L1 and L2 caches is written
to the shared L3 cache. This advance-
ment allows better communication
between the processing cores, reduc-
ing the need for a core to butt in on its
neighbor’s business - an act known as
“cache snooping.’ ’ This more efﬁcient
cache technology in turn reduces the

amount of time the i7 has to take I

data from a comparatively slow main
memory bank.

Intel doesn’t stop there. An article
on Intel’s Web site indicated that future
plans for the i7 would include graph-
ics processing units — GPUS — on-
chip with the i7 processor itself. This
would greatly increase a computer’s
ability to render complex graphics by
allowing it to quickly and efﬁciently
keep track of millions of polygons

According to Intel spokesmen
during the i7  pairing the i7
with fast-access, solid-"state disk drives
will allow computers in the near future
to reach unirnaginably fast speeds
Coupling the processor with an Intel
standard chipset, of which there will
initially be only one variant, indicates
that choosing the i7 computer will be
simple. There will be no more having
a Dell laptop with an unimaginably
fast processor and a slow chipset;

A The i7 costs about the same as the
Core 2 Quad series of processors Al-
though still on the top-end of com-
puting, the i7 will certainly be within

the reach of the average computer 0

shopper.
Be sure to look out for Dell and

Hewlett—Packard to come out with
i7-based computers very soon. Al-
though consumers will have many
processor conﬁgurations from which
to choose, the uniﬁed one—chipset
system  ensure that each conﬁgu-
ration will reach its  potential

Smﬂ Wrliter But entering the season, Pitt

Before ripoff against Miami
(Ohio) on Monday, the Pitt men’s
basketball team performed its
usual ritual. The team joined in
a circle, linked arms, swung back
and forth and had a player in the
middle ﬁre the team up.

The man in the middle was

6—feet-6:inch sophomore for—._

ward Gilbert Brown. But he was
in a tracksuit and had a protec-
tive boot on his leftleg.

Brown is down with what is .

being called a stress fracture in
his left foot. He didn’t play‘ in
Pitt’s first opening game against
Fairleigh Dickinson or its game
against Miami on Monday night,
and a timetable for his return
still isn’t set. _
]unior—college transfer Jer-
maine Dixon started both games
this year with success, scoring 14
points on 6—of-9-shooting from

coach Jamie Dixon said he ex-
pected Brown to be an integral
part of the team. One of the
best athletes that Pitt has, he
played a key role in Pitt’s run at
the Big East title last year.

Pitt coach Jamie Dixon said
he still feels unsure of the situ-
ation, meaning that Brown likely
isn’t ready to return to the court
full time. ‘

‘‘\We’re going to have an MRI,
and then we’ll have a better
idea,” said Dixon. “But he didn’t
feel good. He said about 70 per-
cent.”

Brown’s MRI was set for yes-
terday.

The team is going to take ev-

ery precaution necessary before

Brown sees action on the court
again, as he is poised for a break-
out season. Brown averaged 6.5
points per game last year.

It is a spectacle. The third

1 a stadium would be just like the

ones found in Pittsburgh, Phila-
delphia, New York and around '_
the United States. It would be like
a carnival, with the game being
just one aspect of the entertain-

ment.
Instead of attention darting
to all corners of the arena, all the

fans watch the action on the pitch.

They sit on the edge of their seats

- in a serene and placid silence so

that you can hear the thud of a
player’s foot as it strikes the ball.
They work in unison, sporadically
exploding into chant: MESSI!
MESSI! MESSI! MESSI!

They’ll be heard bellowing
boos at a non-call by a referee or
applauding a strong effort by the
defense. The stands buzz with

anticipation. The collective fervor.
creates a blanket of white noise '
that falls over the stadium like

a ﬂurryof snow on a cold but
sunny winter afternoon.

They earnestly wait, wanting
nothing more than to shift the
very ground they sit on with the
most raucous ovation anyone has
ever heard. V '

What _would suchloyal fans
think of their American counter-
parts? What would they think of

' the people who pay thousands of 1

dollars a year to sit courtside, be-

setonlVl'essi, Eto'oi_

hind home plate or on the 50-yard
line? What about the waitresses
 the beer, cocktails and
food, rendering the sporting event
‘inches in front of their faces just
an excuse to socialize?
This will never happen at

the Camp Nou. -There, up close
doesn’t ‘necessarily mean better.

- . The most expensive tickets are the
A ones that give you the best view

of the game. It doesn’t matter

if you’re up as high as the sky,
because it is always better than ‘
sitting right behind the goal where

the action up close is amazing, '

- but the other side of the ﬁeld is

impossible to see.

‘As the ball ﬁred off Thierry
Henry’si right foot like a missile
from a ﬁghter jet, then deflected
off of the ke'eper’s hands and

" back to Eto’o for an easy score, it

was clear. _ .
It was goal No. 4. This time,

_ jogging over to the corner and to

the fans, Eto’o fell to his knees as
if paying faithful homage to his
master. ' ‘

And all eyes were on him.

“Never doubt that a small group of thought-
. ful, committed citizens can change the world.
I Indeed, it is theonlything that ever has.”
—Margaret Mead
My name is Dan Gore, and I am running to
' be your next SGB President because this univer-
sity deserves leadership that represents the
interests of the entire student population. Pitt
has afforded me tremendous opportunities,
from expanding my academic worldview, to
V _ meeting wonderful people, and participating in a
 community dedicated to achievement. -As a‘
 result, my passion for this University urges me
to advocate on behalf of its student body. My
experience with student organizations has
exposed me to many of the beneﬁts and draw-
backs at Pitt, therefore, there are a number of
"issues that I want to tackle and seek to improve
upon if elected: . -

funding of students organizations is the primary
responsibility of SGB, and in my opinion, per-

- mitting the board to select the Chairperson
lends the process to be susceptible to favoritism
«and cronyism. I proposeto alter the selection

Through my experience in SGB and other
student organizations I have become a
stronger, more understanding, and vocal leader
with regards to all Pitt students. My experiences
have shaped me as an individual and helped me
to recognize the role a student government
should play for the student body, and that is
why I want to be your next Student Govern»
ment Board President. As a current Board
Member, with a thorough understanding of
SGB I will be able to hit the ground running in
 nsuring that the needs of Pitt students are
 being met. If elected as President I will put
students first by doing the following:

-Expanding SGB Advocacy:

student organizations to select the individual.
Each organization that successfully completes
an annual budget request would send one rep-

‘ resentative to a meeting to vote on the appli-

cants for the chair position. This process
removes potential bias and puts the decision in
the hands of students, not the board.

Next, fiscal responsibility‘ must be restored to
SGB. Smallorganizations often receive insuffi-
cient funding, and are unable to coordinate
events due to a lack of ﬁnancial support. In
addition, the fact that SGB asks student groups
to fundraise and then allocates less money -to

them because of their alleged fundraising

capacity is an absurd concept I intend to
explore the commencement of a matching
program, where SGB would match the dollar
figure that small organizations raise. By
enacting this kind of program, students have an
incentive to fundraise, as opposed to simply

‘relying on SGB for all their monetary resources.

‘Fiscal accountability is not limited to how the

-allocations process works, but also, where the

money is spent. It is time to eliminate the
“pork,” and cut wasteful spending. Permitting a

$60,000 expenditure on panther statues that -

neither practically beneﬁt students nor serve

that will go out on campus and talk with
students,‘ to classrooms, and student groups,
implement polls and surveys, and hold forums
to ﬁnd out what students at Pitt care about
most. ' I would also like to expand the SGB

town hall meetings by incorporating speciﬁc

issues and not just" demographics. At these
issue-based town balls, I would like to invite
administrators who would be best fit to work.
with SGB to address the concerns that are
raised. ’

Holding SGB Accountable and Making
Board Members More ‘Accessible to Students:
' I feel it is the job of the SGB President to
ensure that the Board is running smoothly and
as a cohesive unit. Right now Board Members
operate as autonomous individuals and there is

saving money from these unnecessary expenses,
more ﬁnancial resources will remain for student
groups ~ W

Further, I would like to explore the idea of
establishing a “reading day” at Pitt. Most univer-
sities have time in between the last week of
classes and ﬁnals week, yet here, we onlyliave a
weekend. "What if you have an exam in your
class on Friday during the last week of classes,
followed by two ﬁnals on Monday? Two days of
studying is insufﬁcient. I will explore the possi-
bility of abolishing finals on Monday to provide
students with extra time to study. It is unfair that

Pitt students are dctrimcntally affected by this

policy," while students at otheruniversities reap
the beneﬁts of extra time to study.

Lastly, I intend to push for a modiﬁed sign in
policy in residence halls, where students would
be able to swipe in their guests, as opposed to
the current (write in) sign in policy. Not only
would this quicken the pace of entry, and
decrease the likelihood of long lines clogging
security desks, it would also. enhance building
security since the information would be updated
to a monitored database.

these hours will help accomplish those goals.

' Local, State and National Level '

° The mission of the SGB is to represent
students to the University; as well as on a

’ local, state, and national level. I want to make

sure that the SGB is conducting continuous

i would be ideal to deliver seventeen thousand

both impractical and irrational. However, in

the pursuit of student activism in local

Three students play the role of Roc, the Pitt Panther, at football games, charity events

and other public functions.

Best Mascot: Roc

Was’ there really any question about
Pitt’s favorite mascot? It’s Roc, the Pitt
Panther. Go to any sporting event, and
you’re bound to see one of the three peo-
ple who play him dancing with the crowd
and cheering on the team. '

The panther-was named after Pitt foot-
ball legend Steve “The Rock” Petro. His
eyes are,,of course, navy blue,~and his fa-
vorite song is “Hail to PITT.”

The team’s history reads like a story o'f
dynasties, with enduring faith'in coaching

and quarterbacks and the leadership of '

the Rooney family.

The team, originally named the’ Pitts-
burgh Pirates, is known for its stellar de-
fense. In the 19703, the Steelers’ defense
was known as the “Steel Curtain.”

Your first instinct is to be polite and help
her, but then the thought runs through your
head about when you were lost in that first

Best Reason to Skip Class: Sleep

The unequivocal, indisputable
champion of reasons to skip class
is to sleep in. No college experience
would  complete without hitting
the snooze button at least a couple
times per semester. It just feels so
good. So are naps, but nothing
beats sleeping when you know you
should be in class — it’s absolutely
euphoric. However, if you feel
guilty or can’t afford the absence,
remember, you can-always post up
in the back row of class and catch
some zzzzz’s, too.

an inebriated friend, this winner
seems all too obvious. Ah yes, Fri-
day night. The time when your next
class is farthest away, the time to
unwind from a long week of recita-
tions and labs. The time to party.

Homework? That’s for Sunday
between the end of the Arizona—Se-
attle 4:15 game and the start of the
C.olts—]aguars 8:15 game. Movies?
Come on, South Side has $5 movies
(plus free popcorn!) on Monday.

And if you aren’t partying Friday
night, I recommend you stake out
Towers patio and watch the “funny
drunks” waddle back home. Do it
with friends and make it a party, be-
cause, after all, Friday night is party
night at Pitt

Way to Pay for'Tuition: Par-

ents
Dear Ma,

Hey, uh  thanks for paying

my college tuition and room and

board and all that. The private high *

school was cool, too, I guess. Maybe
it was a little overkill — a free car
would’ve been sick — but, hey, it’s
your money

Oh yeah, and the basic ‘needs
like food and gas money were nice
pluses back in the day. I have Din-
ing Dollars now, so you don’t have
to worry about food anymore, but
you’re kind of paying for those
within the room and board, so 
sweet

And, no, Ma, I’m not taking out
a loan. You’re just like a bank, ex-

, cept you’re safer, easier and without

interest —— or repayment in general.
Don’t bother praying for a scholar-
ship, either. A

By the way, can I have some
spending money?

Best NCAA Sport: Men’s

When you enter the Oakland
Zoo, you find yourself in one of
the best fan sections in college bas-
ketball. You’re in the middle of a
sea of blue and gold,Vjumping up
and down, sweating profusely and
yelling obscenities at the top of
your lungs, and it’s beautiful. The
sight of Dejuan Blair’s gaping smile
when he throws down a ridiculous
dunk over Luke Harangody is price-
less, and watching Levance Fields’
last-second heroics against Duke
is unforgettable. Jamie Dixon has
come to Pitt and established one of
the most consistent college basket-
ball programs in the country, and
the fans have embraced this team

- with unparalleled enthusiasm. A

preseason No. 5 ranking might get
the Panther faithful buzzing a little
bit, too. .

Best Spring Break Destination: Utah

Sure, you could go somewhere .warm,
maybe near a beach or on an island. You
could lounge around all day tanning, while
simultaneously ogling your fellow coeds, who
are surely walking around as close to naked
as society allows. Or you can go to Utah. It
might be a bit more active of a spring break,
as you’re in for a week of skiing, snowboard-

out how to fall down a hill. Plus, if that gets
boring, you can get married. Multiple times.

Best Class To Sleep Through: Intro to
Psychology

You want to be studious, so you go to
class. Unfortunately, so do about 400 other
students, many of whom bring along a Su-
doku or crossword puzzle. You don’t, and
eventually you get an overwhelming feeling
to plop your head down and sleep. Go right
ahead. If an aspect of psychology is study-
ing group dynamics and behavior, why not
take a nap and see how the person next to
you reacts when you start drooling all over his
notes? It’s a social experiment; Who knows,
bring a blanket and pillow, and you might
even get extra credit.

Pittsburgh. Unlike any stadium, it offers
a cozy atmosphere where you can breathe

smoke without any effort. Having played

host to the likes of Girl Talk, Immortal

of Oakland and Shadyside, the Cathedral is

interior that makes it the best University

is virtually synonymous with Pitt, because
