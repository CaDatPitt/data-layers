. The Socialist Workers Party is
still battling ,for equal right for
women, by supporting the Equal
S‘ and any
woman's‘ right to have an abortion
if she wishes Maomi Berman,
Socialist Workers Party candidate
iior lieutenant fgovemor‘ told a small

group here Tuesday.

i Why is that so-difﬁcult to give us
(equal rights for women)?” Ber-
man asked. “We know why.
Because women might then de-
mand things like equal pay" for
equal workand this would cut in to
the proﬁts of -the employer.”

During the speech she read

before a group of nine persons ‘in -‘

the . Student iUnio'rii  also

defended gay rights and blasted
the Briggs amendment, a refer-
endum on thevNovember ballot in
California that would allow school
boards to ﬁre homosexual teachers
or teachers who publicly support
equal rights for homosexuals.
“Another intolerable situation is

the harrassment of homosexuals"

and lesbians. It is inhuman to deny
the rights to -gays taken for granted
by others,” she said. “And now
the latest attack is the introduction
of the -Briggs amendment in
California. This amendment. . .is

clearly an invitation for a witch- ’

hunt. We say ‘no" to the Briggs
amendment. ’ We say ‘yes’ to_ gay
rights.”

After .»an appeal from the

The board also has studied the
possibility of supporting the
University’s pledge to adhere to the
Sullivan Principle, a plan that sets
wage and working-condition guide-

workers in South Africa. The
principle states that individuals

Tammy .,Had_dad, Pitt Union
Program‘ Council chairwoman,
admitted yesterday that her organi-
zation violated a contract between
the Student Government Board and
the Office: of Student Activities
when- it arranged the homecoming
concert themselves without using a
local promoter.

“You can say it was a mistake,
which it was, ” Haddad said. ‘ ‘But I
honestly. -thought we were just
putting our name on it so‘ that the

‘ show could be a success.” V
Haddad explained that a rule

governing the use of Carnegie
Music Hall would have obstructed
completely the staging of the Chuck
Man gione concert if the council had
not produced the, show. The rule
states that only non-proﬁt organiza-

.tions' are permitted to promote

performances in that building.
Because a professional promoter
would not be considered to be
non-profit, Haddad said the only
option was to make the homecoming
concert a student-run production.

‘ ‘They did it despite the contract,
which might indicate a policy
change, ’ ’ Haddad said. “But it was

Berman echoed - comments‘ made
last week on campus by Mark
Zola, Socialist Workers Party
gubernatorial ‘candidate, who
claimed there is an 5 offensive
against‘ workers being waged by
businessmen.

“When we look around ‘us, when '

we read the newspapers or watch
TV, when we apply for a job, when
we shop for food or clothing,.when
we pay our rent or medical bills,”
Berman said, “we realize there’s a
war going on out there and we are
the ones under attack. We are
being ‘attacked by those who proﬁt
and keep themselves in control--the
bankers and corporations”.
Berman, promoted worker control
of industry as the solution to the

. such concerts.

providing a quality product to the
most students.”
Haddad’s disclosure came after a

eﬁery dispute between herself and

SGB member Jan Medoff during
the SGB assembly of student
organization leaders on Tuesday.
The dispute originated when
Medoff submitted a proposal asking’
that the present contract between

son and the Office of Student’

Activities to be altered to give the
program council the option of either
producing their own concerts or
going through a professional
promoter. i ‘

Haddad argued that‘ the success ,

ofthe professionally promoted
Chuck Mangione concert should
serve as testimony to the success of
Yesterday’s dis.-
closure dispells Haddad’s argu-
ment. .

‘ ‘A promoter is in the business to

make money, therefore when you
work with a promoter you

downgrade the success of the show 

because of the promoters fees,”

Medoff said. ‘I believe it can work.
The system- of going‘ through
promoters already has proved it

increasing‘ prices that stem from
the war she claims the corporation
are waging on workingpeople.

“It is time for the workers in this
nation to takeover and run the
factories and the mines and the
government,” she said.

Berman also attacked the other
gubernatorial candidates for ignor-
ing ‘the issues she addressed  her
speech.  " .

“What do my opponents say to '

all these issues? For on thing, they
say as little as possible,” Berman
said. ‘When really" challenged we
ﬁnd they are opposed to abortion,
are lukewarrﬁ on the EILA, and I
can’t remember any stand on gay
rights.” _ ‘

C “They support anything that is

There is some division on this ’

While Medoff is in favor of ‘the * _
proposal, fellow board member ,-

student, ’ ’ Hesidence said. ‘ ‘No one
on the board even knew about what
he was going to do. As a result, only
one side of the story came out, and a
lot of students were misinformed.”

Medoff said the fact that he
submitted the proposal independ-
ently only proved to strengthen the
credibility of the SBG.

“If anything, my actions made

the board more credible by showing ,

this was not just the opinion of a
select group of individuals who are
all on the same side,” Medoff said.

The controversy over the
Mangione concert, Medoff’ s pro-
posal and the program council's

failure to provide a concert act for
the Black Action Society’s Black
Week all are interrelated as a result
of yesterday's disclosure.

The program council failed to
provide a performer for BAS
because, according to Haddad, no
agreement between the council and
BAS could be reached.

“We didn’t blow the Black Week
concert as many people have been
lead to believe,” Haddad said.
“We offered them Teddy Pender-
grass, Donna Summer and Al
Jareau, but they said these

performers were not acceptable to -

the black population.” ,
When asked why the contract

requiring a promoter was not
broken to try to provide a concert for
Black Week, Haddad said no act
was available on the date that BAS
wanted a concert, while Mangione
was planning a ‘concert in Pitts-
burgh on a date acceptable to the
homecoming Committee.

“This is a clear demonstration of
a double standard as far as PUPC
goes,” Medoff said, “There were
some favorsdone for Homecoming
but not for BAS. _The problems
between BAS and PUPC always
have been interrelated, but this was
the last straw that broke the camel's
back.

CAS Council Searches For Members

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staff Writer
Dean ‘Irwin Schulman’s CAS
Council just can’t ﬁnd ‘a student to
join the council. The Student

'Government Board has been

unable to ﬁndla single student to sit
on the council. .

The Council began its ofﬁcial
work two weeks ago without any
student representatives. Schulman
and SGB members Dave Hesidence
and "Josh Baylson have undertaken
a search since the beginning olf
school for student membersof the
council. They published news-_
paper advertisements and placed
posters around the campus, but
failed to receive a- single reply.

Despite the lack of student input,
the council contined its work
Wednesday approving, a statistics
major to be contained within the
mathematics department.

The new major passed with the
stipulation that a revision be made

the 46 included in the original
proposal. Schulman demanded the
revision. He said the original
proposal violated a CAS rule that
states no’student can be required to
complete more than 40 credits for
any ‘major. _

Some concern was also raised

.concerning' the possibility of a

“teaching 'overload” for the seven

because of the additional‘ course to
be added to the curriculum.
Professor Mario Benedicty.»

He stated that an additionalone to
two faculty members would be
required as a result of the new
major. .

because it’s not effectively
enforced. Blacks can have unions,
but they are not free to have
recognized unions by the govern-
ment, so the employers, if they
choose, can deal with black
unions.”

Chisek said, when union repre-_
sentatives’ meet employers, to
discuss a contract, government
observers are present. He added,
“Technically, blacks can’t sit on the
(negotiations) board, but employers
can meet with black union
representatives at a different
time.”

Chisek said there has- been no

effective effort to prevent equal pay .

between blacks and whites.

After Rappaport’s statement
about apartheid laws, Wagner said,
“It’s a question of who runs the
country--the majority blacks or the
minority whites.”

SGB president Josh Baylson then
read a letter from Chancellor Posvar

In the last Gallup poll on the
race-, taken the week of Sept. 21,
Thornburgh had been trailing
Flaherty by a hefty 15 percent
margin, 51 to 36, with 13- percent
undecided. Among probable

voters, the margin had been only‘

slightly closer, at 51 to‘ 39 and 10

“I think if we sustain the

“We’ve still got a lot of work to

’/iss3fBireaking the Rules

’,.. It is said things do not always appearthe way they

really are, and one needs to look no further than the
Pitt Union Program Council: to find proof for
that old adage. Or, to put it another way, those who

“forget”'they promoted concerts should not throw .

stones. »
The case of the program council and its chair-.
woman, Tammy Haddad, vs. Student Government

 Board member Jan Medoff and the Black Action

Society has taken a strange and very disturbing turn.
The controversy started when no concert was

'l”’scheduled for Black Week because BAS was told it

must have the show promoted by a professional
A contract between SGB, the parent

of Student Activities states that all concerts must be

,  done under the auspices of a promoter.

The BAS argued it could have arranged and
promoted a concert for Black Week itself but was
turned down. The program council, seeking to use a
professional promoter, could not arrange a concert

I to the society’s liking. J’ :
At .Tuesday’s SGB assembly Vmeeting, Medoff

suggested a change be made in the contract to allow
students to promote concerts independently. -His
idea was strongly attacked by Haddad.

“When we work with a promoter we are assured to
tickets and a concert,” Haddad said. “But when we

. back our own concerts we run the risk of wasting a

great deal of money, not our money, but the money

- of every student withinthe University.”

It is now known Haddad took that very big risk,
and, luckily, it paid off. The Chuck Mangione
Homecoming Concert held Oct. 14 was not
professionally. promoted; it was run by students.

That the Chuck Mangione concert was a success is
not the point. What is important is that Haddad has
fought publicly to keep the “professional promoter”
rule, while at the same time breaking it herself. V

“You can say it was a mistake, which it was,”
H_addad said yesterday; “But .I honestly thought that
we just put our name on it so that the show would be
a success.” A .

Haddadis excuse for her actions is the
management of Carnegie Music Hall, the site of the
homecoming _ concert,‘ only allows non-profit
organizations ‘to promote shows. That, however,
does not explain her actions Tuesday. It is difficult to
believe that Haddad, as chairwoman of the program
council, did not know that the Oct. 14 concert was
not promoted by a professional organization. If she

' 7 Jim Pane, Copy Editor
' Gail Simmons, Copy Editor

was not aware of exactly who was running that con}
cert, a serious evaluation of the program counciI’s '

leadership is in order. If Haddad did know, her
statements Tuesday are shocking, and, to be polite,
her integrity has suffered a blow. .

Haddad said this “bf Medoff Tuesday: “I’m
especially annoyed with his presentation today,
which showed no facts...It was really nothing more
than an emotional display. He said that he acted

student would have facts to back him up.” .
’-We suggest Haddad take stock of her. own words

I and act accordingly.

-A Students and t‘heBasic Issues of the ‘70’s if     

vi modern times.

av K. LEROY IRVIS I

The 1960s is a decade viewed

today as one of great" turmoil. It s

began with the election of a
youthful senator from Massachu-
setts to the presidency—only to
lead to his death, the death of his

'j'7 brother and the death of the most

important civil rights leader of
All three, young
men; all three, dedicated to the
improvement of the human condi-
tion. . ‘ ’ ' '

Besides the untimely deaths of
our nations’s importantxstatesmen,
the ’60s also saw the death of other
young ‘men on another continent-
men who were told they were

fighting to protect American
_'1iberty.

But, the ’60s also saw one other

‘ very important ‘situation-‘unlike
, the others—a favorable situation,
‘ and that was the involvement ‘of’
' young Americans ‘in the political

processes. Although they could not’
cast ballots, they joined hands with

their older brothers andesisters on _ .
picket linesand peace’ detnonstra-_ 

tions.

Finally, the government realized.‘

the need to enfranchise ' these

vigorous and vibrant minds, to"

enlist them as full members of a

H society, to allow the young to share

with the old and the old to share

I with the young to continue the

struggle to improve the human
condition.

But, something happened along
the way, something that became
painfully evident in 1972, the first
national‘ election in which Amer-
icans aged 18 to 21 were eligible to
cast ballots. ' They stayed. home.
And they continued to stay home.
Andtoday young Americans still
stay home. They have no better
record of voting than any other age

, ' group. . .

Analysts who attempt to explain
this, in light of the role that young

people played in the ’60s, say the‘

young are as disinterested in
government as theirpparents, that
they are as distrustful of the
government ‘as their parents and
that issues today are not as volatile
as those that plagued the nation in
the late ’60s.

Whereas the issues then were
the draft, Vietnam and university
administrations, the problems con-
fronting our society today,-

though ‘no less important, espe- A

cially to American youth, are not as
glamorous. They are heart and
guts" eeonomic issues, economic
issues that transcendthe rate of
inﬂation and a numerical quotient
of economic growth. » They have to
do with survival, survival _of the

I confronting earlier

poor and middle-income class
groups. They have to do with
putting food on the table, ﬁnding a
job worthy of human dignity and
respect and ‘affording ‘life—and .111
of the problems with which man
must cope in the process ofliving,
such as learning, working, raising ‘a
family and aging. ,

Young ‘people whose lives waste

on street corners, older Americans

who sustain themsélves on _dog
food, a family that spends all of its
cash reserves to combat sickness:

these are problems just as serious
as those of the ’60s. And these are

problems that government can and

must do something ‘to solve. _They
will not‘ be solved unless all
Americans—-young and old-

’ recognize that solutions are costly

but worth the ﬁnancial cost. They
will not‘ be solved unless govern-

ment through the people realizes '

that every American _Jorn is
entitled to a quality and equitable

education, - proper nutritional care,_
higher education and -job opportun-.

ities and ‘humane ‘care in the older

less important as the challenges

people were involved during the
’60s. A challenge that is IIOI. “on
another continent, but rather a
challenge that could be in your,
neighborhood, may be only a few
doors away. g . \

And it is because government
‘can. solve these problems that

. younger Americans should become

involved in the political processes.
Government and politics never
have been as‘ open as they are
today; it is easier today for ‘younger
Americans to become part "of" the
formal political process, ' whether
that be_ only voting or actual
organizational work.

And believe me, if you commit

A your ener‘gie_s to such involvement‘,
1 am sure our society will make .

progress in solving these problems,
because it will help all of us in

government make our people
aware of what the needs of society
are and what we as a society are
capable of accomplishing.

I cannot forget the effect’ of
young Americans on the 1968
elections. I remember the
attraction of the young to Eugene
McCarthy and Bobby Kennedy. I
remember that as a result of their
campaigns an incumbent president
refused to seek elective ofﬁcey

So, yes, it is possible to have
impact. It just takes ’ some
dedication and ‘commitment, com-
mitment ‘to a democratic process
that for the last-200 years has had
no rivals. - .

"'53,

J‘ I am writing with res/pectto an \ wasan alternative put forth in that F

Oct. 20 editorial, “Whose Side Is
the SGB On?” "

I must take exception to several of
the remarks written concerning the

, SGB’s stand on divestment in South

Africa. The article cited an alleged
change of policy from one of
complete divesting of companies
dealing in South Africa to one of
simple adherence of the Sullivan
Principles. '

First of all, it is vital to note that
the board only has voted in favor of
one stand:divestment. That is, at
our Sept. 24 meeting we voted, 7-0,
to “support the coalition in its quest
to inﬂuence the University to divest
itself of investments with corpora-
tions that have invested in South
Africa.”

The meeting cited in the article
that took place between Vice
Chancellor for Business and
Finance Joseph Dutton, Josh
Baylson, Dave Hesidence and me
was not representative of the total
Student Government Board. In fact,
I disagreed with the results of that
particular meeting. I

The plan to ask the Board of
Trustees to divest of stocks not

adhering to the Sullivan Principles A

meeting. It has not ever been voted
on by the SGB. If it were, I would
have opposed it. .

The editorial also criticized, my
statement that Pitt never will divest
because it is “so involved with the
military industrial complex.” This
statement was taken out of context.
I meant this is a reason why Pitt’s
trustees probably" will not divest,
not why they cannot. One glance at

the stocks Pitt owns, such as Ford, , _

GM and Rockwell, will verify its wt

stake in t e “complex.” Add this
to the jobs many trustees have as
executives in these and other
multinationals and tell me Pitt is not
involved with the military industrial
complex. - .

In conclusion, getting the Trus-
tees to divest will be a difficult task.
I, am in favor of divestment of
companies involved in South Africa,
and always have been. Pitt, as an
educational institution, should fol-
low through on the humanitarian
philosophy it espouses. However,
this is a personal belief, not an SGB

. position.

The Dangers of Outside Interference in Student Governmen 

The recent proposal generated by
members of our Student Govern-

’ ment Board, as reported in the Oct.

20. issue of The Pitt News
concerning the SGB’s objection to

_using student funds as remunera-

tions for student leaders, is

admirable. «
Conversely, the alternative ap-

proach of providing tuition-free

academic credit “subject to the

' scrutiny of a faculty adviser’ ’ strikes

me as another example of a recent
trend, student sell-out. Giving our
student leaders tuition-free credit is
not a bad idea in and of itself, but I
strongly object to outside interfer-
ence from University faculty (or
staff) as advisers to Student
Government.

A basic question that arises from
the SGB’s alternative proposal is
how much “scrutiny” will this

faculty’ adviser provide? Will the
SGB remain the autonomous
student-run collectivity that it is
chartered to be, free to express
whatever opinion it pleases, or will
such an adviser merely serve to
avert student opposition to Univers-
ity’ policies and activities? We
already have seen how the SGB can
be swayed when they take a position
contrary to that of the University
(e.g. divestiture of holdings in

South African companies that
support apartheid). Should we
accept this as a sign of future SGB
behavior?

~ My ultimate question is will the 1

proposed faculty adviser discourage .
the “oscillation” evidenced by the

SGB’s handling of the anti-aparthe- .

id issue or will he encouragethe
board not to take an extreme
anti-administration position to be-

Reader Objects to Press Coverage of ‘Poor’ Millionaire ’s

No! No! No! Say it isn’t so! In the
last decades we’ve been inundated

_ by a ﬂood of weird happenings that 5

correspond to the permissive age
that is the result of television
watching by kids from infancy.
«The confusion that TV induces in
unformed mentalities has lead to
rock’n’roll, Presley, The --Beatles,
Transcendental and other medita-
tion cults, advocation of sexual
degeneracy by leading sex books,

ripoffs like EST, Primal Therapy, ,

salesof pet rocks to morons, disco,

‘indulgence in sex perversion by

idiots who do not know it destroys
the individual—well, there are too
many other idiocies infecting the

v country to name them all; but when

a paper uses nearlya third of a page
to report how some poor slob (Rob
Martin) was overcome by grief and
guilt and mental pain because he
was‘ given a million bucks, our
credibility is destroyed.
Fortunately, a single reading of
the item again reveals the fraud in
this new, young millionaire’s claims
of sorrow on account of receiving

this money. Firstly, it was given to '

him by his mother. So it was really

his all this time. He's been a rich ,
kid from birth. What is he trying to
achieve ‘by pretendingﬂthat he has '

been_thrust into a worldof luxury ‘

with which he cannot-cope? The real

dilemma in the minds of‘ all these ‘

rich kids is .that they have no

understanding of values. Never
having known poverty, they know
nothing about hunger, lack of proper

clothing, shelter, schooling, all the‘

adversities that can make or break a
human being.

And being rich, he did not know he
would create an awful backlash from
college students and ducated
people. Instead of stating that he
was a college seniorf‘ he should of
{said he was a rich kid_dawdling away
his time in college. .Because, we can
assure him 100 percent that he is the

. only college senior who ever existed

that didn’t know what to do with a
million dollars.

The answer to what to do with a
million dollars is elementary.

Now to expose the fraud in this

that he is the only one of wealth who
ever complained about such a groovy
condition, he is trying to-imply that

What these adjectives describe was
the performance of jazz violin

' impressario Jean-Luc Ponty at the
‘ V Stanlev Theatre Wednesday night.

Ponty’s wizardry with the violin,
coupled with his composing talents,
amazed the near-capacity crowd to
the , point of standing ovations
following every song.

The revolutionary French per-
former (as he has been referred to
ly jazz enthusiasts), along with his

ilfive accompanying musicians,

,Allan Zavod on keyboards, Casey

Schuerell on drums, Jamie Glazer
and J ogquin Lievano on guitars and
Ralphe Armstrong on bass) opened

‘ the program with ‘ ‘Arora, ’ ’ the title

cut from one of Ponty’s earlier

 albums.

He then swung into a medley of
songs _ from his latest release,

“Cosmic Messenger,” which in-

cluded the title track and “The Art
of Happiness” as the focal points.
From there, Ponty played “The

"Struggle of the Turtle to the Sea”
from his “Enigmatic Ocean’ ’ album
« and finished with another medley.

That set included ‘ ‘Milky Way’ ’ and

, ‘-’Egocentric Molecules,” high-

A rare treat will arrive at the
Carnegie Institute’s Museum of Art
beginning today with the opening of
“Monticelli: His Contemporaries,
His Inﬂuence.”

The show centers around 78
works by Adolphe Monticelli, a
little-known painter born in Mar-
seilles in 1824. Although Monticelli
was known and widely exhibited

the first major exhibition of his work V

improvisation. solo that left the
audience in awe of his tremendous
musical abilities.

After a thundering ovation, Ponty
returned to perform “New Coun-
try,” a song that only can be
described as “foot-stompin’ jazz.”
His second encore, the title cut from
the album “Imaginary Voyage,"
left no doubts about the musical
genius of Jean-Luc Ponty.

The main impression of Ponty
was one of space and dimension.
Music did not simply explode out of
the speakers at the Stanley; it
ﬂowed smoothly and continually
with enough power to leave’ the
audience slightly stunned and
hungering for more.

Ponty’s unique style of jazz (or
Jazz-rock, as his music has
sometimes been labeled) helps to
bridge the gap between jazz and
rock enthusiasts. In short, Ponty is
not just for jazz fans. Ponty is for
music fans and is an experience that
is not soom forgotten.

Other noticable elements of the
program included well-done solos
from _each member of the band,
excellent working of electronic
equipment and a professional job of
lighting. ‘

work. The paintings exude a

Pitt Students Scare Up-  

ByJIMLEWIS

Pitt News Staff Writer

V" iTh‘éihlrsi"'to'i‘Pitt" students’ Mike

Mervosh and Jeff Bayer, St. Canice
Grade School is haunted.

 “The school- needed money,”
1»Mervos_li-explained. “‘£_['hey used to

i have a fall festival and ‘nationality

events‘, but they didn’t’ make
enough. So we decided to build a
V lfaunted house.”

Along‘ with 40 neighborhood
friends, “Mervosh, a psychology
major, and '-Bayer-, I an engineering
major, utilized the ‘dark basement
of the old Mt. Oliver school to

produceone ‘of the most successful '

charity gimmicks in Pittsburgh.

“We’ve made about $2,000 last
weekend,'.’-" Mervosh said. .“T_hat
surpassed last year’s total. And
we're the cheapest admission—'-
only'—$1.50 to enter.”

Some cost was cut because of
business ‘ donat'ions—'—two funeral
homes donated a coffin apiece-
but expenses in the creating ‘of the
house were paid for ‘by the
creators.

“About half the stuff was
donated, half bought,” Mervosh
said. “We had to buy the wood
and paint, which costs a lot, of
course.” »’/I

The entire‘ project, which in-
cludes two man-madelmazes, took
about six weeks to complete and, in
its second year, has become

/

Funds For St. Canice

somewhat famous.

“So far, we’ve had people from '

Carrick, , Elizabeth-Forward, and

even relatives from West Virginia‘

come to\ our haunted house,”
Mervosh said. “Everyone who
goes through it tells us it's better
than the March of Dimes one-
theirs is brightly lit. It’s just not
scary when it’s brightly lit. Ours is
totally dark.” . H
The ‘St. Canice house is so
haunted the group must repair the

canvas andwood mazes damaged

byppanicking ‘patrons on off-nights
(the house is open today through
Tuesday, 7 p.m.).

“The canvas 3.110 wood are
wrecked by people falling .
through,” Mervosh said. “And -‘at
times, people panic’ andput their
fists and heads through the wood.”

The haunted house is so scary,

‘T5

many people have turned back/

after paying ‘admission.

“Thursday night we had 36
people walk down the stairs to the
basement,‘ look andturn back,”
Mervosh said: “And ‘we had two
girls faint. In fact, some of our
people work at the door upstairs
because they’re too scared to work
in the basement.

“We even had a lady wet herself
in one of the mazes. If people are
not‘ scared, it's no fun.”

Pitt Asslstai ' It Johnson Contacted by A&M Faithful   a‘ 

ByMARKMURPHY
pm News sum Writer

Jimmy. Johnson, Pitt's assistant
head coach and defensive coordina-
tor, yesterday confirmed published
reports that he has been contacted
by “interested people” concerning
the Texas A&M head coaching job,
but news of such conversations
gsurprised Aggie interim athletic

'director Marvin Tate.

A story in yesterday’s Houston -

Post said/ persons interested in

Texas A&M football spoke to
Johnson about the job vacated
Tuesday by Emory Bellard. Both
Johnson and Tate insisted that no
one officially connected with A&M
approached Jackie Sherrill’s top
assistant.

“I just talked to a couple of
interested people, but I have not
talked with any Texas A&M
officials,” said Johnson. “It’s

an interesting situation. I am from’

that area (Johnson is from Port

Arthur, Tex.; A&M is in College
Station).

“To my knowledge no one has
contacted Jimmy Johnson,” said
Tate. “I just picked up The

‘ Houston Post this morning ‘and ‘saw

the story. I’ don’t’ know who
released that information. ' It’s
unfortunate this sort of thinghas
gotten out.”

“I was with the president this
morning and am sitting right now
with the chairman of our athletic

committee,” Tate continued. “No
one in an official ipacity has
contacted Jimmy Johnson. ’ ’
Bellard resigned his dual posts of
football coach and athletic director
after learning he would be replaced
at the end of the year. It has been

reported that disgruntled alumni

were pushing hard for Bellard’s
removal. Tom Wilson, the Aggies’
offensive coordinator was named
head coach. .
‘-‘The alumni can go out and talk

to anyone they want to,” said Tate,
“but they’re not going to hire the
next coach. I know Jimmy Johnson,
and all I can say is that this thing
coming out is very unfortunate. No
one has contacted Jimmy Johnson,
and no one intends to.”

“Right now I’m in the middle of
our season, and that’s all I’m
concerned with,” said Johnson.

“Tom Wilson is their interim coachai

for this year. ’ ’

Boaters Stun Third-Ranked Penn State, 2-0  

By ANNA ARLOTTA

it! News Staff Writer

The Pitt soccer team put

everything together combining a,

tough offense with an awesome
defense‘ to shut out the Nittany
Lions of Penn State, 2-0, Wednes-
day night at Pitt Stadium.

Junior goalie John Bonessi, with
the I support of an ‘outstanding
defensive effort shut out a team
whose only’ losses, three in 12
games, have come to top-rated
teams in the nation—-'-Hartwick (last
year’s NCAA Division Ichampion),
No. 2 San Francisco and top-ranked
Indi'ana.

Goals by Mark Nigh and‘Marty
Moyer helped add Pitt to that list.

The ﬁrst half between Pitt and its
_cross-state rival was a defensive
battle that ended scoreless. Penn
State outshot the Panthers, 14-6,
both defenses sparkled. V

Pitt goalie Bonessi credited his
defense with an outstanding ‘ job.

“Penn State had some great
shots in that ﬁrst half, they
controlled the ball and moved it
well downfield,” said Bonessi.
“Each time our defense rose to the
occasion and prevented them from
capitalizing on any drive. Anytime
I was unable to stop the ball, the
defense was there; they looked
nothing ‘less than outstandi‘ng."’

sion stopped numerous shots that

Pitt threw well. and often to its
tight end last year, and Steve
Gaustad ﬁnished second among the
team’s receivers. ' _

With Gaustad returning.. many
believed the Panthers would do
more of the same this season. But
they haven’t. Gaustad, who has
caught nine passes after hauling in
31 for 514 yards last season, thinks
he has the answer to the problem.

“The ‘ coaches seem to think
Rick’ s (Trocano) strong points are in
other areas,”
“They think he’s better at running
and doing other things with our
option game.”

However, Gaustad, a favorite

target of Matt Cavanaugh’s last

season, doesn't necessarily agree
with that assessment.

“Rick can pass,” he said. “I
think he proved that against North
Carolina when he drove us to the
winning touchdown.”

Trocano, whose fourth-quarter
passing charged Pitt to a 2'0-16 win
over the Tarheels, would like to
throw more to his tight end—if he
were allowed. ,, I

‘ After being moved to point guard

us,.” Grgurich said. “Once we put

sophomore said. “It’s up to them
what we do.” ‘

Panther receiver coach Dave
Wannstedt said Pitt would like to
throw more to its tight end, but ‘ ‘the
situation hasn’t come up yet where
we’ve been really able to do it.”

“We’re making an effort to get
Steve the ball this week,”
Wannstedt said.g“We’re going to
use a few ﬂat passes and slant
patterns in which we hope he can
get open -and catch the ball.”

Wannstedt says it’s too early to
worry.

“Sure, Steve only has nine
catches,” the Panther assistant
said. ‘ ‘But guess how many he had at
the same time last year? Nine.”

Gaustad, who ‘didn’t start last
week against Florida State because
of a bruised thigh, -isn't worried
either.

“Sure, I’d like to catch a few more
passes,” he said. “Any receiver
would, but I think I've done my job in

other areas. “I’ve blocked well,

which is just as important as how
many passes you catc .” .
Gaustad disagrees with those
who consider him the “forgotten”

reason for his increased playing

“It’s a great experience being" on 7

a winning pro team. I've set

Cavanaugh, a hero for the Pitt
‘Panthers anda second-round

this year.

Hebert said the Pantherettes

“peaked twice,” once before Cindy
Chambers was hurt and last week

at Delaware, where Pitt ﬁnished
second. After Chambers’ injury,
the spikers had to change their
blocking pattern totally. ‘‘It was
like starting all over,” said Hebert.

As far »as individual perform-
ances are concerned, Hebert has
been pleased with each player in
one way or another. Freshman
Paula Olsen, who came to the team
and started right away, has done a
‘fterriﬁc job.” ‘

“I believe Paula is the best
freshman I’e seen in the East, but
she needs -to spike more intelli-
gently and be more consistent,”
Hebert said.

Cavanaugh was the second
quarterback-—after Doug Williams
of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers-and
the 50th player overall selected in
the draft. He might have been
taken sooner except for a freakish .
knee injury during a workout late
last winter. A '

Cavanaugh caught his football
shoe in the turf and eventually
needed surgery to remove damaged
cartilage in the left knee. The.

operation was ordered by the -

Patriots after they drafted him.

“I’m 100 percent physically
now,” says Cavanaugh, ‘.‘but I
don’t really expect to play. Not with

He spends his Sunday afternoons

"That is my only’ real

Cavana’

The other freshman on the team,
Mary Beth Niemitz, is the least
experienced player but, “has the
size and desire to learn and has
come a long way since Septem-
ber.”

Sophomores Maria Perez and
Ingrid Mueller both got off to slow
starts but steadily have improved.

“Maria has done a good job
setting a complex offense, and I
believe Ingrid has begun to
dominate like she should,” Hebert
said. “She’s one of ‘the most

’ spectacular athletes I’ve seen.”

— Nancy Zentner‘, also a sopho-
more, has “improved tremendous-
ly’ ’ over last season, and senior Pat
(Stretch) Montgomery is playing
“her usual consistent game”
despite some injuries. ‘

Junior Andra Pletz is enjoying

row and leading the AFC East with a
,__6-2 record, will start Grogan on
Sunday against the New York Jets. .
Coach Chuck Fairbanks plans to
stick I with Grogan unless the
four-year veteran is hurt.

When he drafted Cavanaugh,
Fairbanks conceded the team might

’ end up with two quarterbacks who

wouldn’t play, but ﬁgured it was
wise to stockpile as many high-
grade signal callers as possible.

“Because of my college back-
ground I’ve received a lot of
attention, more than I deserve,”
says Cavanaugh. “Afterﬂall, I
haven’t done anything. But it’s
exciting just to be in pro ball. I’m
prepared to play if I have to.”

At Pitt, Cavanaugh’s passing
statistics improved yearly. He
ﬁnished with 31 touchdown passes,
completing 206 of 362 attempts for

her best season. '

“Andy is‘ an excellent blocker,
and receiver,” said Hebert. "‘She’s
been working very hard and it’s
paying off.” . .

Chambers, a junior, has been out
with an ankle injury since late
September.-

“Before Cindy was hurt, she
was deﬁnitely the most dominating
player on the team in ‘spiking
efﬁciency and her floor game,”
said Hebert. “She’s still a leader,
despite being hurt. AWe’re ' really

‘looking forward to getting her
back.”

Kathy Sonricker. a junior/, was.

put in the awkward position — of
I having ‘to fill Chambers’ shoes and

has done "‘a ﬁne job.” According ‘

to Hebert, Sonricker is a real asset
on defense and one of the

3,378 yards.

A tough specimen, the 6-foot-1,
210-pounder broke his leg as a
junior but came back a month later
to lead the Panthers to a national
championship and a Sugar Bow _
victory over Georgia. :

As a senior, Cavanaugh broke his
wrist in the opener against Notre

_Dame but came back after three
weeks. He completed 23 of 36
passes for 378 yards against
Clemson in the 1978 Gator Bowl.

  censiﬁtencvi  ntinuesro Plaguewomenspikers

team.

Pitt will take its 22-6 record to ‘*7

Maryland today to competing in the
Maryland Invitational’. In addition,
North Carolina State, Temple,
Wake Forest, Penn State, Navy,
. Georgetown, North Carolina,
Duke, West Virginia‘ and ‘Delaware
also will compete.
“We have a good shot at winning
the tournament,” said Hebert,
“but I haven’t seen any of the
southern" teams, so we really don’t
know what to expect.”
The ‘season is only four weeks
from completion, and Hebert

hopes the Pantherettes will “get a»!§.A.

lot tougher, mentally and continue
their physical progress.”

' Said the coach, “The only‘ thing
that can stop us now is ourselves.”

ugh Accepts Backup Role in’ Pros  

“My senior year was good
preparation for the NFL,” Cava-
naugh says. “We went more to the
passing game after Tony Dorsett
went to the pros.”

Dorsett, now ‘a Dallas Cowboys
running star-, got publicity during
Cavanaugh’s first two varsity
seasons. But meantime, the

quarterback polished his own‘;

running game, a key element in the
Patriots’ attack that sends Grogan
darting all over the field.

Haniers Short of WVU

West Virginia proved to be wild

."‘but' not particularly wonderful last

weekend, when the Panther cross-
country squad came within a dozen
or so points of beating the
Mountaineers during the United
States Track and Field Federation
meet. Eight schools participated in
the race of approximately ﬁve
Morgantown miles, /but ‘the Pitt-
WVU matchup was of special
interest. 2 ‘

Of the 75 runners from schools
including Camegie-Mellon, Frost-
burg and,West Liberty, Pitt’s Gary

Siriano was ﬁfth -with" a time of
26.20, Mark Studnicki was seventh,
nine seconds behind. Randy Bailey,
14th, Steve Moore, 16th, and Bob
Lee, 17th, completed the Panther
scoring. .

Pitt’s harriers slowly are achiev-
ingithat much-talked-about goal of
every. cross-country team—running
as a pack. The Panthers, however,
have chosen to bypass the Central
Collegiate championships tomor-
row. Instead, they will head into
Ohio for a dual meet with Kent
_State. -

Boaters Upsetuittainy  

(Continued from page 12)
board. Seniors Erv Seigel‘ and
Mark Nigh, junior Tom Liebenguth
and sophmores Tom Kunkel and
Danny Hamm worked hard with the
goalie to blank ‘the Lions.

Pitt, deﬁnitely the underdog,
conﬁdently came back in the second
half. After 13 minutes of play, the
Panthers scored the ﬁrst goal of the
game when Mark Nigh recorded
his ﬁrst tally" of the season. A
mixup occurred at the Lion goal
mouth, where several Panthers had
gathered. Nigh emerged from the
crowd to put Pitt up, 1-0, a lead it
never would lose.

All the momentum suddenly‘
swung to the Panthers, and they
began to take total control of the
game.

 

_ N

Tempers began to ﬂare ‘soon
after the goal when Pitt’s Tim
Pearson and the Lions’ Bill
Klauberg had a little dispute at
midﬁeld. A conﬂict was avoided,
and fouls were called and the game
resumed. The incident ‘had an
effect on the Panthers, however,
and ‘their taste for victory increas-
ed. Once‘ again ‘the Panther
defense’ asserted itself and ‘cleared
any Lion shot that came within 10
yards of the goal. ”

- ..With four minutes left Marty
Moyer emerged from another
crowd around ‘the Penn ‘State goal
and ‘scored: his third of the season.

Moyer, who has seen limited action
this season, again proved himself
as an asset to the Panther offense.
The ‘Panthers believe the win

proves they are a much better
soccer squad than their record (5-6)
shows. .

“I think ‘this win can prove we
should be a highly touted team in
the East,” said Liebenguth. “If we
were to play our season over again,
we would. have a much better
record.”

The Panthers can prove them-

selves even more by defeating Lock/ ..

Haven, defending Division III
champs, on Friday at Pitt Stadium.
Another win added to Pitt’s record

. will show that ‘Wednesday night's

game was for real. . \

“If we beat Lock Haven along
with Penn State,” said Pearson,
“we know the win over the Nittany
Lions was not‘ a fluke; it was the
real Pi .,”

 

Ricky Johnson puts the clamp on the Seminoles’ Mark Lyles. ‘
