VOLIlME BIGHTY-EIGHT, ISSUE FIFTY-FOUR

Year in Review    
SGB members evaluate achievements, assess performance

By Matt Groff

Asst. News.Editor

In all of the hype surrounding the
campaigns‘ and platfomis of this Student
Government Board election season, nine
people at Pitt watched the activity with
the insight gained from campaigning last
year and. trying to follow through on
their owrfpromises.

During a year which SGB President
Jacob Brody called “average,” he and the
eight board members have followed
through on several important election
issues only to be halted by “administra-
tive” or.“monetary” difficulties.

But overall, Brody said it was a pro-
ductive year.

“I think: we've improved communica-
between the SGB and
faculty,” Brody said. “We put the final
touches on the transportation system
worked out by last year’s board, we
gained parking spaces for students and
helpedexpand choice dollars.”

According to board member Dave Ott,

one can only expect to do so much dur- ‘

ing a single year term in SGB.

“Candidates have to expect a lot of
failure,” Ott said. “If you’ve brought a
problem to the attention of the adminis-
tration, you’ve made progress.”

Board mem-
ber August
Imholtz said stu-
dents who
know the sys-
tem realize the
difficulty of
completing pro-
jects.
“Everybody should spend time on SGB,”
Imholtz said. “When you work on a pro-
ject, there are so many divisions of stu-
dents, faculty, management and adminis-
tration to deal with, it makes it hard to
communicate.” . A

In his campaign last year, Imholtz said

he planned to be a liaison between stu-

dents and the university administration
in order to foster clear communication

- between both parties.

According to Imholtz, he responded to
student concerns about the availability of
bike locks around Pitt. He said he met
with.Mary Bonach of the" Pitt,eB.ook

Center to discuss the idea.

“The main problem with bike theft in
Oakland seemed to be cheap locks,”
Imholtz said. He said the locks, now
offered in the
Pitt Book
Center, are of a

than most
locks

“ W e
ordered the

‘ locks and cur-
rently have them in stock,” Bonach said.
“I don’t think any place else in Oakland
stocks them.”

Also, last year Imholtz, along with.

board members Tony Moody and Joe
Foner, said they wanted to make more
cubicles available to students.

“One of my original goals was to
increase cubicle space in the [\Y/illiam
Pitt Unionl,” Imholtz said. “What we got
was a compromise —— better regulation
of the existing cubicle spaces.”

According to Imholtz, one-third of the
44 existing cubicles were not officially

used last semester. He said there is a.

 

meeting planned by the WPU’s building
management to go over some rules witl
student groups. Imholtz said he workec
on the project with Pitt’s Director 0
Student Activities Joe Cavalla, who sai<
Student Activities has been looking at thc

_ utilization of cubicle space.

“\X/e’ve had a good dialogue witl
SGB,” Cavalla said. “They made us awar<
of some things and at this point, we arc
basically answering the need for cubicle
space.”

Moody said in his campaign last yea
he would “listen to students’ concern.-
and ideas and do the bestjob I can tc
implement policies which directly coin
cide.”

According to Moody, in addition t(
working -on the cubicle spac issue, hr
worked with the Pitt Book Center ant
Department of Housing to improve an(
publicize the Bridge of Knowledge bool
donation project.

“It is a program for students who wan
to get rid of textbooks they can’t use,’
said Moody. “It benefits needy student:
elsewhere.”

Black Bazaar hosts several Pittsburgh vendors

By Rebecca Baker
Staff Writer

Forbes Quad became an inter-
national marketplace yesterday
afternoon when vendors, artists
and chefs set up shop at the
Black Action Society’s annual
Black Bazaar at the University of
Pittsburgh. .’

For those who wanted to do
their holiday decorating early,

several vendors sold colorful
hand-made wreaths, reindeer
and other ornaments, some with
African themes.

“This wreath is made of a
tribal print, and this one’s a
traditional African print,” said
Pitt alumni Marie McIntosh.
“lMy sister and I] wanted to
combine ethnicity with the holi-
days.”

Another booth, displaying

holiday decorations, had a more
personal extra item for sale —
the autobiography of the ven-

dor’s mother entitled, Rosie, the I

Courageous Crybaby.

“It even has calligraphy
from my grandmother,
who documented the history
of my family, like births,
deaths, marriages,” said ven-
dor Sylvia Spencer.

In her third year at the bazaar,

Ida Clowney also brought some
of her hand—made creations,
one of which included a table
lamp covered with pictures of
black entertainers.

“Some of these are over 30
years old,” Clowney said, refer-

zines clippings.

Pitt campus police made sev-
eral arrests in the past few
weeks for use, sale or posses-
sion of marijuana and marijuana
paraphernalia.

According to Pitt campus
crime reports, all arrests have
taken place in the campus resi-
dence buildings of Towers,
Sutherland and Holland halls.

According to Gary Moses,
assistant director of Public
Safety, the students arrested for
use of marijuana were removed
from their residence halls and
referred to the Drug
Rehabilitation Programs at
Student Health. Those arrested
for sale of marijuana were
removed from the university.

In 1991 there were four
arrests for possession, use or
sale of drugs. In 1992 there
were eight arrests. The arrests
that happened last week have
upped the number to 17 for
1993 so far. _

According to Moses, there is a
resurge in the use of marijuana
because it. is not as hard of a
drug as others being used.

“More people are willing to
experiment with the drug,”
Moses said. “That is by no
means a large number of stu-

Moody also'”"served as liaison to the
Department of Parking and Transportation
in their efforts to increase parking available
to students.

“I’ve called students all year randomly to
find out general concerns,” Moody said. “In
a few cases I was able to help solve speciﬁc

helped students find storage space and
worked on proposing additional bﬂ<eracks
at Pitt. ' ‘

In his campaign last year, Foner said he
wanted to translate student needs into pro-
grams through the use of surveys at Pitt to
“reduce the information deficit.” Reducing
this deficit, according to Foner’s platform, is
necessary to the reduction of student apa-

thy at Pitt.

In a few weeks, Foner’s computerized
version of this survey will be in operation.
The survey will be available in Pitt comput-

er labs under’ the Telnet’ application on
Pitt’s mainframe. According to Foner, the
survey will contain questions dealing with
problems of the SGB and university in gen-
eral. Foner said the survey program will be
available for faculty and is a quick, easy
way to monitor student interests.

“The benefits of [the survey] are endless,"

' Foner said. “Professors can beneﬁt from this

because they’ll get a general feeling of what
they should be teaching.” K

Foner also completed a student discount
program which involves more than 20 local
businesses.

“Businesses are still signing up,” Foner
said. “It is a program that directly benefits
students.”

Foner said the work on cubicle space was
productive because “groups who don’t use

their facilities will be more closely scruti— i

nized.”
Board member Tara Munkatchy cam-

J

paignedi on a promise to give students easi-
er access to scholarship information. Also‘,
she said she would concentrate on
women’s concerns, a campus _escort service
and recycling in the dorms.

According to Munkatchy, the scholarship
book is complete and available to students
in the SGB office. She said the escort ser-
vice plan, which was extensively worked
on by former SGB Safety chair Shahla
Eberhardt, is on hold at this point.

“The problem is liability and who would
insure an escort service,” Munkatchy said.

Munkatchy said she is currently working
on a proposal for a Women’s Studies major.
She said the project will continue next year
whether or not she is elected SGB presi-
dent.

“We are looking at the courses and the
expenses involved,” Munkatchy said.

Malcolm X was by the far the
most popular “celebrity” at the
bazaar, with his image and
words appearing on dozens of
l_1_ats, bags, T-shirts, sweatshirts
and prints. _

Artist J.C. Allen also displayed
his prints and paintingsof
African- Americans. One, called
“Against All Odds,” showed
three young black women in
white dresses holding African
flags which are lifted by the
wind.

“I’m a commercial artist by
trade, but this is where my heart
is,” Allen said.

Negro League Baseball Fan
Club member Rahman Shareef
also said his “heart” is in his
hobby, which involves collect-
ing memorabilia of the former

Pittsburgh Crawfords and the

Homestead Grays.

“I buy a lot of the stuff from
retailers,” Shareef said, “but I
also get it from people’s attics.”

Shareef had autographed pro-
grams, baseballs and trading
cards for sale. “Some of the

rarer things, like old gloves and
bats, I would never sell,” he
said. ’

Shareef said it doesn’t bother
him that more people ask ques-
tions than make purchases. “I’d
like. to make money, but it’s not
the most important thing,” he
said. “The history is what mat-
ters, and I never get tired of
educating.”

Artist Alvin Brock wanted‘ to
make history an important part
of his display as well. He
offered a 50 percent discount
on any painting for correctly
guessing what African nation
his art represented.’

Masks, jewelry, statuettes,
greeting cards, books and
cassettes showed the his-
tory, progress and accom-
plishments of African-
Americans.

However, _not everything
for sale at the Black Bazaar had
an African—American theme.
Other vendors sold perfume,
jewelry, dolls and business sup-
plies. I _ _

The Black Bazaar was part of
the Black Action Society’s cele-
bration of Black Week. '

the taking away of our birth
right by the European people,”
said Eybers.

“We believe in order for
African people to to receive
freedom, Rastafari must connect
with our roots. Realizing [that]
we are the true chosen people
of the Creator, we have to undo
what the European has done.
This means to build our own

institutions, and that’s why the
African-American culture center
is so important to us.” '

Rastafari was a prince in
Africa who became _the
Emperor of" Ethopia and
changed his name to Haile
Selassie.

“To us [the Rastafari] he is
The Father,” said Eybers‘. “He
can trace his family back to The

Bible, back to King Solomon.
Therefore we know we are the

Creator.” —
“We are doing our best to

ject with Susan Hanson of Pitt’s Women’s
Studies. _

“The process [of setting up a new
major] is a very complicated
one,” Hanson said. “With the budget and
class constraints, you run into many
problems. But I know Tara has been
'r'ésearching the possibilities.”

According to Munkatchy, she helped-
set up an AIDS seminar this year and
raised $274.80 for charity through “Walk
for Panther Pride” which she set up. ‘

The issue of recycling at Pitt, men-
tioned in her platform, was also investi-
gated by board member Brian Bolton.’

“I was upset about the little support
we received from the administration on
this issue,” Bolton said. “I looked into
recycling services and felt this was a
major. need on campus, but I got little
support from Pitt.” .

Bolton said that in his campaign last
year, his focus was academics and insur-
ing that there are enough quality acade-
mic advisers at Pitt.

According to Bolton, during his first
month in office there was an increase in
advisers. ’

“I also wanted to make sure athletes at
Pitt were being properly treated, in"
regard to academics,” Bolton said. A

“I met with Ron Brown and the ser-
vices available to athletes are excellent,
but you can’t force [athletes] to use the
services."

Bolton said he is still open to any stu-

dent ideas and will act upon them if pos— '

sible. .
~ “Student concerns such as ﬁnancial aid
have been brought to me and I’m cur-

rently looking into it,” Bolton said.‘

“Demographically, I, want to learn why

scholarships have been pulled from stu-
dents whose grades have actually risen.”

He said he is working with Pitt’s
Department of Admissions and Financial
Aid on the matter. _

Bolton, who has not attended an SGB
meeting this semester, said he had noti-
fled the SGB of his schedule.

“I am a [teaching assistant] and have to
meet at that time,” Bolton said“. “The
meeting time is one of the few things
that has upset me about this year’s SGB.
My report has been read at every meet-
ing.”

According to Brody, Bolton did not
make a serious effort to attend the meet-
ings.

“After a couple of meetings, he told me
he had his focus group at that time,”
Brody said‘.

“At the time, I was sick of dealing with
this stuff. I am involved with focus
groups myself and you can set meeting
times at any time.you want. If people

,want to go to SGB meetings, they will

find the time.”

‘In T om Grassia’s campaign, he talked
about campus safety and misspent
money in the SGB. ,

“This year’s board made some great

strides in safety, but we did it as a-
group,” Grassia said. “I also looked into‘

the allocations system and realized the
process is fair.”

Although admitting he’s learned that,
“some of the things I wanted to do didn’t
ﬂy,” Grassia said that is the risk one takes
when becoming a board member.
Grassia said he has made progress in try-
ing to establish an “off-campus version
of the Resident Students’ Association.”

“People have approached me and -said
they’d work for such an organization,”

Grassia said. “That is important because
you often hear of people [being] interest-
ed in a group, but nothing can be suc-
cessful unless people are willing to work
for it.”

Grassia served as the SGB’s liason to
Freshman Council and said he gets satis-
faction from knowing the group’s size
and active status.

“[Grassia] showed a lot of initiative this
semester in bringing freshman to the
SGB office and getting people involved
with Freshman Council,” former
Freshman Council President Todd
Neufeld said. .

Ott’s campaign platform consisted of
several points: to increase campus safety
through student patrol, to expand com-
puter labs to North Oakland and to
increase the hours of operation for Trees
Hall. ,

According to Ott, one of his largest
contributions to this year’s SGB was
increasing student participation in senate
committees.

“Student patrolling involves huge lia-
bilities for the university,” Ott said.
“Interest in the idea dwindled when the
shuttle service was expanded in
January.”

According to Ott, he received a nega-
tive impression from the administration
about the possibility of a North Oakland
computer lab and his attempt to extend
Trees Hall hours was blocked by the ath-
letic department.

“Candidates have ideas about working
on projects on SGB,” Ott said. “But those
that get on the board find out that even
the-simplest projects involve a lot of
bureaucracy. It is good to come in with
high hopes, but it comes down to
money.”

_Ott was board liaison to the Inter-fia
ternity Council. According to IF(
President Jeremy Weiss, Ott was “fairly
ineffective in his role as liason.”

“I expected someone who could tel
me what SGB could do for IFC,” Weis:

said. “We had planned a couple of meet _

ings, but it never worked out.”

During Ted Schroeder’s campaign, he
said the SGB “must work much more
actively with the student governance
groups and organizations.”

He also said most of the problems a
Pitt stem from students’ lack of aware
ness. ,

"Schroeder said he helped improve
communication between governance
groups through his involvement in the
President’s Council last semester.

“There were several complaints abou
the homecoming election process am
we helped get it changed,” Schroede
said. “I also looked into complaint:
about landlords by off-campus students
but there are legal limitatio_ns. We
couldn’t publish a list of bad landlords.”

According to Schroeder, one of hi:
responsibilities was to serve on senate
council with Brody and represent stu
dent interests.

Schroeder said they pushed for at
undergraduate business school and more
stringent standards for faculty salarg
increases. I ‘

“Some parts of this year were frustrat
ing for us,” Schroeder said. “We can only
do so much. What can you do when SGT
holds a town meeting and only two peo
ple showed up?”

Another one of Schro'eder’s responsi
bilities was to serve as an SGB liaison te
the Engineering Student Council.

“He came to some of our

meetings and encouraged us to
get more involved,” ESC
President Jeannette Johnson
said. “But I think he could have
served us better as a liaison.”

Brody began his term as pres-
ident amidst a storm of contro-
versy over the SGB retreat at
Nemacolin Woodlands in
January. The retreat led to an
allocations reform later in the
year

“The incident was blown out
dfproportion, possibly due to
personal differences between
the SGB and other organizations
at Pitt,”Brody said. “A lot was
accomplished during the
retreat.” .

Brody campaigned last year
as “a proven leader who will
put students first.” He said he
believes this year’s board has
helped students in various
ways.

“In addition to the lighting
and transportation plans which
this board followed through
upon, we gave support to the
renovation of Schenley Cafe
which expands the use of
Choice Dollars,” Brody said

According to Brody, he was
involved with the drafting of a
proposal for an escort service,
but said the project has been
put on hold. A

“Due to the urban__ environ-

ment at Pitt, SGB figured it was
much more practical to imple-
ment an extensive transporta-
tion system,” Brody said.
“Brody said his idea for a clock
and gazebo as landmarks on the
William Pitt Union lawn have
been recieved well by the
administration.

According to Brody, various
organizations at Pitt will be

funding the clock to be dedicat-
ed to former provost Donald
Henderson. The gazebo plan is
on hold.

“We are creating a landmark
on campus to fit in with the his-
torical style of the Union,”
Brody said. “It has been pur-
chased and will soon be
installed.”

Brody also said he has served
as the representative of the Pitt
student body for various com-
mittees and university functions.

In a speech at last week’s SGB
meeting, Brody explained his
view of the function of SGB

president.

“The committees have specific
tasks‘which they have been
charged with,” Brody said. At
the board level, members are
elected and expected to work
on projects and serve as liaisons
to various student groups. The
president acts as a facilitator to
the board members and a con-
tact person for the ‘administra-
tion.”

According to Brody, he had
an “average-type” board to
work with this year which
“probably_wasn’t extremely suc-
cessful”.

“Their records speak for
themselves,” Brody said. “I’m
not going to bother comment-
ing. They all could have done a
better job.”

He cited the fact that many
projects started in January by
board members are still being
talked about today.

“Don’t gripe at the president

[about the progress of board]; I
am not here as a baby-sitter,”
Brody said.

“I do my job, but it is not to
constantly motivate others. The
board is made up of nine elect-
ed officials, who, as successful
student leaders, should be moti-
vated to follow through on their
ideas.”

From Nov. 3 to Nov. 6, a
morass of college radio deejays,
journalists (amateur and pro),

-musicians and record label reps

overtook New York for the 13th

annual CMJ Music Marathon.
Organized by-the College

 

Music Journal, the event pre-
sents a forum for artists and
record labels to get their music
(or “product”, as some of them
call it) to a wider audience via
college radio. The deejays, in
turn, get a chance to see a myri-
ad of bands every night; rub
elbows with their favorite n1usi—

cians and label managers; per— -
petuate unanswerable questions

like “Is-it—okay-if-I—play-the-
new-Pearl-_Iam?”;
lot of free stuff.

This year’s Mu-sic Marathon

took place at the Waldorf-
Astoria Hotel. Each day, several
panel discussions ‘took place on
subjects rangingfrom feminism
in music to artist management
to musicians with their own

record labels. Each panel con-.

sisted of a moderator and eight
panelists who had some associ-
ation with the subject. After dis-
cussing, or in some cases argu-
ing, among themselves on their
topic, the moderator took ques-
tions from the audience.

While the panels can be
entertaining, it’s debatable as to
whether or. not they draw any
firm conclusions or enlighten
the audience. Some panels
digressed into shouting match-

es. Others were tilled with pan- '
elists who had nothing to say or

made it obvious they would
rather have been somewhere
else.

‘Women in music was a signif-
icant topic this year with two
panels devoted to the subject.
“The F Word: Women, Music,
Activism” tackled the issue of
feminism and its place in music.
Moderated by journalist Evelyn
McDonnell, who founded the
New York, organization Strong
Women In Music, the panel
attracted a standing room only
crowd consisting of all most as
many men as women.

On the panel, Mecca Normal’s
Jean Smith said she likes to
speak of feminism “in plurals. I
think there are probably as
many feminisms and feminists.”

Chin-A Panaccione, a panelist

-from Island Independent Labels

who recently launched her own
female-only label, decried that
major labels employees don’t
like to address, “the F word.”
‘_‘Few women at major labels
will speak about feminism or

‘ help other women,” she said.

“Why aren't there women from

other major labels on this panel?

 

and pick up a ,.

'’ ''I'.I..I..I..IJ £111 LVIJWO, aaauaauay, .I.'IllV\.«.I..I..I.lJ\.}.l J..I., 1.77,)

We could be role models.”

The next day an all-male
group discussed the topic in a
panel sarcastically titled “Bitches
Ain’t Shit But Hos and Tricks:
To Support or Not to Support
Women in the Music Industry.”
While the discussion intended
to encompass all styles of
music, it kept coming back to
depictions of women in rap
music. ,

Things "became particularly
heated when James Bernard of
the magazine The Source was
accused of supporting rapper
Dr. Dre who repeatedly used
misogynists descriptions of
women in his lyrics and in the
press. While Bernard tried to
avoid the issue at first, he came
to Dre’s defense after panelist
Jim Fouratt demanded a
response.

Dr. Dre’s song “Bitches Ai_n’t
Shit” “is deeper than what you
give it credit for,” Bernard said.

B.C. thinking
bowl game

Byjason Brame
Asst. Sports Editor

It seems ﬁtting that Pitt should
finish up its home schedule
against the Boston College
Eagles.

In a season that has included

4 one top 25 opponent’ after

another, the Panthers have seen

just about every aspect of win-
ning college football, from the
run—and-gun, rapid-ﬁre offense
of Virginia Tech, to the power-
house, run-on-your-grill Ohio
State attack, to the stone-walling
defense of the Miami
Hurricanes. ‘

But this Saturday‘ Pitt will
have to stop what may be the
most balanced and consistently
talented offense that they have
seen all year.

BC enters the game ranked
fifth in the nation for total
offense with an average of 501.6
yards per game. They rush for
an average of 204.9 yards per
game and throw at nearly a 300

per game (296.8) clip.

 Eiaaa. Eagles bring balance

 

“Their balance is excellent," with two straight losses: 7-23 to

Pitt head coach Johnny Majors
said. “They’re racking up about

Miami and then 21-22 to an
upstart Northwestern squad -

 

500 yards per game, and that

 

gets your attention.”

but have stormed back to knock
down six straight victories.

. “We came out of the block
very slowly but we came

together and forced our guys to ‘

realize that it is a team game,”
Boston College head coach
Coughlin said.

In their stretch, the Eagles
have scored no less than 31
points (at Rutgers) and have
scored as many as 66 (vs.
Temple).

The main reason for the surge
is also the recurring nightmare

“We continue to see outstand-
ing quarterbacks,” Majors said,
referring to BC stand-out Glenn
Foley.

“I am certainly not going to
take time out of my quote, busy
schedule, to'research the last 25
years to see how many out-
standing quarterbacks we saw
in that time,.but I don’t remem—-
ber ever playing. against such
good QBs.”

Foley is taken partly out of
the mold of Ohio State.’s Bobby
Hoying and partly out of the
mold of Jake Kelchner, and pos-
sesses many of the characteris-
tics of each: strong arm, experi-
ence, size, quickness and intelli-

_ ~ gence.

“Glenn has played extremely
well and the thing I’m most
proud of is that he has shown a
lot of poise and effectiveness,"_
Coughlin said.

THE Pl'IT NEWS, PREGAME, Thursda ,.November 11, 1993 _

(1 attack to Pitt Stadium

 

Foley is 144 for 236 (61 percent
completions) for 17 touch-
downs. Despite his rushing net
of negative 32 yards, he has
accumulated 2,542 yards in total
offense this season. In his past
six games Foley has thrown one
interception while accounting
for 16 touchdown passes. His
passing efficiency rating is now
164.2 — fifth best in college
football. »

“He has a wonderful arm,”
Majors said. “[He’s] Very active
and has tremendous confi-
dence.

"His efficiency and success
can be contributed to his
tremendous confidence level,”
Majors said.

Foley is helped by fullback
Darnell Campbell, who leads
the nation in scoring with 17
touchdowns.

The senior has lead the Eagles
in rushing all year, averaging
4.8 yards per carry and 95.4
yards per game.

Campbell teams up with
junior tailback David Green to
round out the talented back-
field.

Foley predominantly teams
up with tight end Pete Mitchell,
who leads BC in receiving with
a 12.5 yard per catch average.
Clarence Cannon and Keith
Miller, split end and flanker,
respectively, will also see many
opportunities.

Defensively, BC, according to
Majors, is “a solid, sound” squad
that predominantly uses a five-
man front. '

Outside linebacker Stephen
Boyd leads the defense with 122
tackles, including 58 solos.
Inside ‘backer Brian_Howlett,
free safety Terence Wiggins and
strong safety Eric Shorter each
have 77, 58 and 55, respectively.

Pitt safety

Doug Whaley

By Cory Walborn

Senior Staﬂ’ Writer

This Christmas break Doug.

Whaley will travel the required

25 minutes from campus to his
home in Upper St. Clair.

It will be his fourth consecu-
tive trip spent eating turkey
with his family and watching
college bowl games on TV.

For an average Pitt student,
which Whaley is not, these fes-
tivities seem quite normal.

But to a senior defensive back
if the University of Pittsburgh,
such holidays are just plain
tough.

“It’s very hard,” \X/haley said
of Pitt’s four-year absence from
the college bo.wl scene.
“Sometimes I sit and think about
it, but you can’t dwell on the
past. It would have been great

[to go to a bowl game], but I .

have no regrets.”

T hat’s a typical Doug Whaley
statement — a positive, refresh-
ing response from a young man
with his head sitting firmly on
his shoulders.

Lauded as one of the best

high school football talents in‘
Western Pa. in‘ 1989, Whaley 9

has been through it all as a
Panther.

His roller-coaster ride, how-
ever, will come ‘toan end this
Saturday as Whaley will step on
the Pitt Stadium turf one last
time against Boston College.

One last time in a blue and
gold uniform.

“It’s going to be weird,”
Whaley said of his last home
game.

“Time ﬂies and it goes by so
quick. I’ll just play my hardest
Saturday and leave everything
on the ﬁeld.”

He has already left everythin
in the classroom. a

Maintaining a 3.8 G.P.A. at
Upper St. Clair and continuing
his academic success at Pitt
(Whaley was named to the Bell

of Pennsylvania Scholar-Athlete

team earlier this year), Whaley
is the epitome of time manage-
ment.

Whaley, a" Business Major, said

of ‘the secret to his footballand.

academic success.

“We football players might be .
the best time managers around," '

“Actually, I get my worst
grades when I don’t have a lot
to do.” ‘

Andthat has not been very
often.

Coming to Pitt in the fall of
1990, (after turning down a
smorgasbord of institutions
including Harvard, the Air Force
Academy and Hawaii) Whaley
played in all 11 Pitt football
games that season.

“It was a big surprise to play
so early,” Whaley said.“Usually
you’re redshirted, you learn the
system and build your body that
first year.”

But Whaley spent plenty of
time on special teams and at
nickel linebacker his first year,
earning a varsity letter in the
process.

Forget about reclshirting,
learning the system and build-
ing the body — Whaley was
already on his way to being suc-
cessful.

During his sophomore year,
things got even better for the 5-
foot-11-inch, 185-pound
Panther. Helping Pitt burst out

to a 5-0 start, Whaley finished
second on the team in total
tackles (86) and led the team in
solo tackles (51). He also had
four interceptions and two fum-
ble recoveries.

His academic awards kept the
pace, too. Whaley gained GTE
District II Academic All-
American status in his sopho-
more year at the University of
Pittsburgh.

In 1992, Whaley continued
his success early in the season
and finished fifth on the team in
tackles with 54. For the second
straight year he was named to
the GTE Academic squad while
also being selected to the 1992
Big East Conference All-
Academic Team.

Whaley has also been on the
Dean’s List and Athletic
Director’s Honor Roll as well as
being a charter member to Pitt’s
Blue 8: Gold Society, an alumni
support group that works to
enhance the university’s image
through local community ser-
vice. '

again been a stalwart in the Pitt
defensive secondary. But more
importantly, the elder Whaley
has been the leader within a
young corps of defensive backs.

“You give the younger play-

ers tidbits,” Whaley said. “You

show them the tricks of the
trade and keep telling them
their time will come.”

However, through \X/'haley’s
four years at Pitt, the Panthers’
time has never come.

Compiling a 14—28—1 record
(and only one winning season)
during \Vhaley’s tenure, Pitt has
not been the most successful
place to play Division I football
to say the least.

But for the scholar-athlete
who donned the No. 24 jersey
for four years, none of the loss-
es have permanently rubbed off
on him. '

“I would not have changed

my decision to come to Pitt,”
Whaley explained of his corn-
mitment through the hard times.
“It’s been great.”

“In fact, everything about the
university has been great. From
the faculty to the athletic depart-
ment to the students and espe-

cially the players, they will be .

my friends for life,” Whaley
said.

But what about the holidays
and all the bowl games on the
tube? -
“It’s still hard,” Whaley said.
“My friends are never home for
Christmas and I am.”

“But I have no regrets; Pitt has
been an all-around excellent
experience,” Whaley said.

That’s another typical Doug
Whaley statement.

And in college sports these
days, those kinds of statements
are more than welcomed.

Pitt’s football team has seen
its share of top—notch quarter-
backs lining up against them
this season.

This Saturday is no different
as the Panthers take on No. 22
Boston College and signal—caller
Glenn Foley. ' ,

Under Foley’s wing this sea-
s’g_n the Eagles are soaring, lead-
ing the conference in passing
offense, first downs, third

down-conversion percentage

and total offense.

“This is the best group of
quarterbacks I have ever played
against in a season; they are all
good athletes,” Pitt coach
Johnny Majors said. “Now we
have to face Foley from BC.

“They are leading'theiBig East
in offense and I think are as
high as fifth in the country in
total offense — racking up over
500 yards a game with over 500
through the air,” Majors said.

Foley has thrown for 2,574
yards passing, entering

Saturday’s game vs. Pitt as tops‘

third in the conference in pass-
ing efficiency with a completion

percentage of almost 62 percent_

and a rating of 164.2.

Majors places Foley near the
top of this year’s group of ﬁne
quarterbacks the Pitt Panthers
have had to face this season,
attributing to him a wonderful
arm, extreme accuracy, tremen-
dous confidence and most
importantly, according to
Majors, a great deal of experi-
ence.

“There’s nothing like experi-
ence, which gives [Foley] his
consistency, success, and great
confidence,” Majors said.

Boston College coach Tom
Coughlin realizes the impor-
tance of his’ starting’ quarter-
back, as he gives Foley nothing
but high praise.

“Glenn has played extremely
well. He has ran our offense
with great poise. He has not
thrown the interception and has
learned to move in the pocket
better. He has learned to face
the blitz muchbetter as well as
any other situation thrust upon
him during the course of the
game,” Coughlin said.

Foley has progressed and
improved each year during his
career at Boston College.

This 6-f00t—2-inch 207-pound
senior passed for 2,189 yards as
a freshman, 2,222 yards as" a
sophomore, 2,231 yards as- a

‘junior and has already sur-

passed his season high this year,
totaling almost 9,000 yards thus
far in his career.

Foley’s passing totals rank
him second all—time on Boston

Boston College's go-to gun: quarterback Glenn Foley

The Big East boasts‘ ‘several great signal-callers. Foley may be the best of the group-

College’s passing record book
— trailing only Golden Eagles
great Doug Flutie, who threw
for 10,579 yards while playing
for the Eagles from 1981 tc
1984.

Foley is also one of two B.C.
quarterbacks to throw for over
2,000 yards in three different
seasons (The other is Doug
Flutie).

Success in sports is nothing
new to Foley. He was rankec

the top quarterback to come-

from the state of New Jersey ir.
1989. " .

He played for Cherry Hill East
High School and was selected as
Player of the Year by the
Philadelphia ' Enquirer anc
Gatorade. L

Even though Glenn managec
to lead his football team to a
state championship as a senior
— throwing for over almost
2,000 yards — heidid not stoj:
with football in high school. He
lettered in three sports, captain-
ing his baseball team and earn-
ing all-conference on his basket-
ball team as well.

Sports also runs in Foley’s
family, as his father playec
quarterback at Boston College
from 1963 to 1965.

He and his father are alsc
joined on the football field by
his brother Ed, who was captain
while playing center at Bucknell
until 1989, and younger brother
Kevin, who is a redshirt fresh-
man quarterback at Maryland
Foley’s brother Cliff playec
baseball for Villanova.

Striving off the field is just as
important for Foley as on the
field. ‘ _

He has already earned a
degree in sociology and is now
working toward another degree.
Whatever that degree may be,
this red—headed, freckled kic
will undoubtedly be successful,
because due to his strong work

' ethic, success is synonomous

with Brett Foley.

Nofjrest for -weary gas Pitt volleyball fa

By Ryan Buncher
sem'or'staff. Writer

Last weekend, the Pitt volley-
ball team clinched the regular
season Big East championship
by pounding Boston College.

Next weekend, the Panthers
will go for the postseason ver-
sion of the title, which brings
with it_an automatic bid to the
Natio'nal*.Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament.

In between, there will be no
cruising into the Big East tour-
ney for the Panthers, as defend-
ing Metro, Conference champion
Louisville visits Fitzgerald Field
H-ouse." Friday night. Notre
Dame,- the No. 17 team in the
cotintry, follows Sunday at 2
p.m.

“There "are several opportuni-

said.

“There is the opportunity to
beat two very good teams, one
in the top [20]. It is the opportu-
nity to give yourself a lot of con-
fidence going into the confer-
ence tournament.”

Begor added that Pitt has a
good chance to improve its
seeding for the NCAA tourna-
ment.

“If you win those, it has a dra-
matic effect on where you will
be seeded,” Begor said. “Two
late wins over quality oppo-
nents will count heavily. It
could be the difference between
a-‘really tough match in the first
round and one that you really
should win.”

The Panthers enter the match
on a five-match winning streak,
losing only one of 16 games in a
streak of matches against unim-
posing competition.

Pitt finished that streak last
weekend at BC and Rhode
Island without sophomore
defensive specialist Laura
Horvath, who was suffering
from back" spasms. She had
been the only Panther to play in
every match the last two sea-
sons. ‘

“She practiced [Tuesday] for
the first time in a week,” Begor
said.

“If there is any way for her to

be out there, she will play. She’s

a tough nut. _
“Other than Horvath, who is
still sore, this is the healthiest
we've been all year,” he said.
Begor also said the Panthers
areright where they want to be
entering the match, having
wrapped up the Big East and

now facing two quality oppo-“

nents.

“We scheduled these matches
because we wanted great coin-
petition and we’ve got that.” r

‘Ward 8: Co. to be ego trippi

The time has come, the wal-
rus said, to talk of many things:
of ‘Noles, of Irish, of quarter-
backs, of college football kings.

One team has, as football

‘purists like to say, everything

that college football should
have: tradition, big—tirne media
exposure and its own national
television station. 5
The other team has been as
dominating as any other in the

- college football world for the

past seven years, but still seeks
its first national championship

- because its been spurned by

fate several painful times.
Thematchup is, of course,
lilly—white Notre Dame versus

high-profile Florida State for
braggin’ rights, the number one
ranking in the country and the
inside track to the national
championship.

Very unsurprisingly, many
sportswriters have been blinded
by the glare from the top of the
Irish helmets and seem to think
that Notre Dame has the inside
track to this game. This is just
not the case.

First, the temperature is sup-
posed to\be 50 degrees with
only a hint of rain. If that makes
a difference, which it really
doesn’t, then the argument that
the Seminolesfcan’t play"grind—
it—out, bad weather football with

.-—y .;rr

the Irish is already out the win-
dOW..

But even if it were to be a
tundra, Florida State is hardly
soft against the run, giving up
only 97.2 yards per game. They

Second, people are saying
that Notre Dame has tradition
behind them, and that FSU has
none. The Irish may have Knute
Rockne and George Gipp and
Paul Houming, but unless they
can handle quarterback Charlie
Ward, it means nothing at all.

Thirdly, it real-ly does not mat-

0' dogs with assistant hoops coach Joe

By Stephen Flinn
Staff Writer

As we sat around a table full
of “O” dogs and fries, Pitt assis-
tant basketball coach Joe
Desantis elaborated on his
thoughts about the 1993-94

Panthers and college basketball

n"1‘ general.

DeSantis is beginning his sec-
ond year as an assistant coach at
Pitt. Previously, he coached
right down the street at
Duquesne for three years.

_ Desantis played college basket-

ball at Fairfield University in
Connecticut and graduated as
the all-time leading scorer for
the Stags with 1,916 points.

One of his primary duties at
Pitt is recruiting on the East
Coast. One of the main thoughts
on Desantis’ mind seems to be
the astonishing parity in the Big
East this year.

“I think [that] from top to bot-
tom all the teams are really
good,” Desantis said. “Any team
has the potential of winning on
any night. Even teams-picked

toward the bottom of the Big
East in polls are good teams.”

Which brings up a good
point. Pitt has been picked as
low as seventh and eighth in
some preseason polls, ninth by
the Big East. Why?

“I don’t think it’s meant as any
disrespect toward Pitt. I just
don’t feel there’s much differ-
ence between one and nine, so
I think it’s a case of someone
having to be seventh or eighth."

Another reason Pitt may have
been picked toward the bottom
of the Big East is last year’s sec-
ond-half spiral, which led to-Pitt
just barely making the NCAA
tournament. Thiswas afterila
marvelous start early in the sea-
son — beating teams like UCLA
at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena
and Illinois on the road.

“I think after Pitt’s first go-
round in the Big East, our oppo-
nents adjusted and guarded
Jerry McCullough a" lot closer,”

Desantis said. “That had a lotto,

do with [McCullough’s] perfor-
mance in the second half of the
season as compared to the first.”

Will the Panthers make
adjustments to address the
problems they faced last year?

“Our shooting coming off the
bench should be much better
this year. We had to redshirt
Jason Maile last year because he
came, down with mono,"
Desantis said. "We will have
him come off the bench as well
as [rookie] Sotiris Aggelou, who
is another excellent shooter.

“With the people we have
returning and our newcomers,
we should be able to free things
up more for our offense”

Desantis continuedto elabo- —

rate on some other newcomers
to the team —'players that
should have immediate impact.

“We have two [junior college]
players that should be able to
contribute -- Willie Cauley and
Jaime Peterson,” Desantis said.
“They will bolster returning
players to make what should be
a good front line with some
excellent depth.”

After Pitt’s first practice at
midnight madness, it seemed
that some players may have

   
   

. picked up a step or two. Were

we just seeing things?

“I think we’re going to be a
little faster this year and a little
quicker. We may push a little
more. Some people did work

out and play over the summer,

which should improve us as a
team overall,” DeSantis said.
Speaking of improvement, it

seems the Big East has lost‘

some of its tradition and pres-
tige as a top conference in col-

lege basketball. What is this
attributed to? _
“When the Big East started
out, it was amazing. The media
jumped on the bandwagon and
the conference got tremendous
coverage. Thus, everybody
wanted to go to a Big East
school. That image has faded a
bit and it’s still hard for the Big
East to compete with such tradi-

tional conferences as the ACC
for example,” DeSantis said.

17th-ranked Irish.

Notre Dame is ranked at the top of the Mideast
Region at 21-5. All five of the Irish’s losses came against
top 20 teams (in the American Volleyball Coaches
Association poll). Notre Dame’s one victory against top
20 competition was a 5-1 victory over no. 9 Nebraska
551 Sept. 25, three weeks after the Comhuskers knocked
off an injury-weakened Panther squad.

“They played a strong schedule. They are an experi- -

enced group. They are balanced,” Begor said. “I don’t
see them as being physically as overwhelming as a
Nebraska. It is a match we can win.”

Junior outside hitter Chrissy Peters was the AVCA
National Player of the Week after the Nebraska match.
She is the top attacker (4.03 kills per game) and passer
(4.03 digs per game) for the Irish.

Notre Dame is a deep club. Their recruiting class was
ranked third in the nation by Volleyball Magazine, but

only outside hitter Jenny Birkner has been able to find
consistent playing time.

Birkner is. a top candidate for the Midwestern
Collegiate Conference Newcomer of the Year. She is
second on the team, with a .303 attack percentage and
250 digs.

On the negative side, Notre Dame will come to
Pittsburgh without head coach Debbie Brown. She and
husband Dennis Brown are expecting their first child
early next month and she is no longer able to "travel
with the team. Assistant coach Steve Schlick will take
over

“It’s hard to say [what effect that will havel,” Begor
said. “In my experience, it doesn’t [matter] at this point.
Teams are in a rhythm. It’s a matter of execution. At this
point  it is really in the hands of the athletes. That’s
the way it should be.”

SERVES AND VOLLEYS: Junior setter Annie Mernagh
was the Big East Player of the Week. She had

:1 12 digs and 61 assists (20.3 per game) as the
‘Panthers clinched the Big East regular season
title by sweeping Boston College last Saturday.

- Mernagh also dished out 54 assists and
'14 digs as Pitt knocked off Rhode Island
Friday night. She is currently 14th in the nation
(first in the Big East) with an average of 12.99 A
assists per game.

Notre Dame beat what has
become a very disappointing
Michigan team, squeaked by
Northwestern and ‘Purdue and
trailed Navy at halftime. Their
wins over BYU and USC were
hardly impressive.

Florida State, while beating
up on consistent top-25 squads_
Virginia, Clemson and North

proving that they can indeed
win the big game.

Faul Failla usurped Kevin
McDougal’s starting quarterback
job, but neither have ever had
to play in a game of this magni-
tude and neither have really
shown this year that they will be
dependable in this type of pres-
sure cooker. Lee Becton and
Ray Zellars are very good backs,
but they haven't really seen a
defense like FSU’s. .

There is no comparison in
team speed. FSU is fast on both
sides of the ball and may be
bested by Miami, if anyone at all
—— in overall talent.

What will help the Irish is an
extra week, not only to prepare

and heal up in tropical Indiana.
Having recovered from early

' injuries, Notre Dame has gotten

younger players, more playing
time and is now a good deal
deeper than when they came in.

But when it gets down to it,
the ‘Noles have everything in
their favor, and Holtz and green
crew have to play way above
their heads to even hang with
Florida State. Some have said
that everything is too perfect for
FSU. A No. 1 preseason ranking
gets ruined when you play so
many top—25 teams. This does

See, at ND, big games come
along every  week or so. The
pressure to succeed and the
expectation to win is always,
always, always hovering over
the Irish — like a hellish storm

Forget that they’ve outscored
their opponents, 9,000,000—17.

Forget that Charlie Ward is

Trying to show both sides of a sexual harassment
case in an honest, unbiased manner is going to be diffi-
cult, if not impossible, but City Theatre’s Oleanna man-
ages, even if the score is anything but even.

David Mamet’s intense power play of a drama takes
place in a college professor’s office. A confused, seem-

ingly clueless student comes to her teacher for help.‘

His condescending attitude and ideas about education
don’t pacify her consistent reply, “But I don’t under-
stand.” Sheregurgitates her notes‘ from class back in his
face without knowing what she’s saying. In an effort to
help her, John offers to tutor her. .

The second act opens with Carol wielding all the

power after ﬁling charges of sexual harassment against
John before the tenure committee. Here the roles
switch and we see the fomierly mealy—mouthed student
spitting out skewed accusations, some legit and some
downright ludicrous.

But Carol really hasn’t reached new ground; she’s
doing exactly what she did in the first act as a confused
student. She’s just repeating and “doing what she’s
been told.” Only this time it’s the local campus
Women’s group that’s doing the talking. In a ﬂeeting
second we see her doubt about the whole thing, but it’s

not enough and the play ends with a surprisingly vio-
lent twist. I

In a play like this, there’s so much open space for
interpretation that the casting can completely alter the
audience’s perceptions of the whole situation. And in
this particular production, Kenneth Meseroll and
Victoria Rhoades left me with the impression of an arro-
gant but sincere teacher and a cold mouthpiece.
Though Carol is a victim of all the infomiation and mis-
information that has been shoved down her throat, I
feel John is the victim.

Tony Ferrieri’s set is awfully swank for a college pro-
fessor considering most professors I’ve had dwell in
microscopic cubicles lined with papers and crap every-
where. ,

“The first verse is about Eazy E.”

“Yeah, Dre calls E a bitch, a
woman, less than a man,"
responded rapper Hakim.

While both panels elicited
quite a response from the audi-
ences, one would be hard

pressed to say what results

came from either of them.
These aren’t necessarily new
issues. Gerard Cosloy of
Matador Records continually

stressed that the best response
to misogyny in the music will
come from releasing records of
your own as a counteraction.
“That way you’re' competing on
their own level.”

Saturday morning comedian
Penn Jillette moderated a panel
of seven people who_ run their
own record label. While the
panel was dubbed “I Did It My
Way:Artists with Their Own
Labels” a more appropriate

name might have been “We’d
All Rather Be Someplace Else.”
Jillette, admitting he didn’t
know the panel roster until that
morning, peppered the talk
with quick_one—liners and very
little else. Shimmy Disc’s

SGB REPORT CARD

BOLTON. . . . F

SGB members fail to live upto campaign promises

Stagnant. Ineffective. Resume-
building. Those are the words that
first come to mind when evaluat-
ing this year’s Student
Government Board members.

Although SGB still has a few
weeks left in the term, with elec-
tions coming up for next year, we
wanted to show students how the
people they voted for- can
become chameleons if they aren’t
asked specific questions before
elected. Those who use generali-
ties and seem like leaders’ often
turn into tlieisliirckers of th:e'lSGl3.

We based our evaluation on
what the board members stated in

their campaign platforms last’year-

and how they fulfilled their
promises. For those that were
very vague in their platforms, we
evaluated their overa_ll perfor-
mance.
‘J Starting with their president,
Jacob Brody. Brody’s plat-
form stated that he would provide
the leadership to “move  uni-
versity forward.” He stated he’ll
represent students and that his
past SGB service qualified him for
the job.Brody got oil‘ to a rocky
start with the controversial
Nemacolin Woodlands leadership
retreat. Brody was criticized for
spending thousands of dollars on
extravagant lodging and food. I
Yes, we will have a gazebo and

a clock gracing our;,‘_ca'rnpus.
thanks in part to Brody, but ,

somehow we feel students are a
little more concemed with rising
tuition and fee rates and how
their SGB is ﬁghting against them
more than they are in the aesthet-
ics of the union lawn. Students
were slighted by their elected
leader.

Brody accomplished more as a
board member with his escort ser-
vice proposal and transportation
concerns than he did this year;

Brody does attend and partici-
pate in University Senate as. well
as committee meetings and does
deserve credit for doing so,
although it is part of his job. We
will cut him a break in his evalua-
tion realizing the fact that he
didn’t have much to work with in
his board and often had to prod
them to any ounce of action. But
nonetheless, he could have done
more. If he could do above aver-

age as a board member,"we
should be able to expect more
from him in his higher position.
Overall, Brody did an average
job and for that we give him a C
grade for his presidential term.
Moving on to the board, which
Brody agrees is less than com-
mendable. “Projects that started in
January people are still talking
about now — it’s a poor showing
for people who are supposed to

be self-motivated leaders. 

they’re performance speaks, for
itself,” Brody said.’  _ ‘
President pro tempore Ted

Schroeder is the epitome of the ‘

true SGB resume builder. OK, so
Ted did raise a few points of stu-
dent concem at a Senate Council

meeting — once. We’re hard.

pressed to think of anything else
he did other than occupying that
student seat at the Senate meet-
ings.

Although Schroeder points to .

his “achievement” of improving
relations with governance groups,
(a part of his campaign platfonn)
governance group leaders aren’t
as complimentary of his perfor-
mance. .

“We need to meet with these
groups on a frequent, regular
basis, so as to stay in touch with

the needs of our students,’—’. I
* beneﬁtedclrarity. It was a great

Schroeders platform stated?
’ “He came to some ofour meet-

Sings’ and encouraged us to get

more involved.  But. I think he
could have served‘ us betteras a
liaison.” Engineering Student
Council president Jeannette
Johnsonsaid.

We think Schroeder would
have served the ESC and the uni-
versity community best had he
not rim in the first place. Overall
he did nothing positive for the
student community; for this he
receives an F.

Brian Bolton, last year’s highest
vote getter, has to be the biggest
let down’ of the 1995 board.
Receiving the mostvotes, we
expected him to take action for
the students and lead the board in
an upward motion. We were
wrong.

Although Bolton said he job as
a teachingassistant was at the
same time of the SGB meetings,
as a generously elected member,

he should have made other
arrangements

Bolton often stated in his
reports that he was “looking into”
issues. But “looking into” just
doesn’t cut it when you have no
concrete results to -show from it.
Anyone can pick up a phone and
“look into” something, but as an

- elected board member, it was his

job to actually do something
about it. -
Overall, Bolton let the students

down .in his. laek,of leaders:l_iip.-;_.
 5 oi'ganizations.'.*”‘. ‘ ..

and ‘fOr.tl1is,he7receives an F. J’ v "
Tara Munkatchy does receive
accolades for actually completing
a designated goal and having
something tangible to show for
her efforts. Munkatchy based a
large part of her campaign last

year on providing scholarship .

information for students. She did
complete a scholarship booklet
and does have scholarships listed
in the Student Miscellaneous
Guide. Although, the information
in the guide couldlhave been
compiled more effectively and

included more pertinent informa-

tion, she did do what she set out
to do.

Another goal of hers was to ”

combat student apathy, which she
attempted to do by organizing a
walk . for Panther Pride which

idea, if. we exclude the fact the
advertisements for the event out-
weighed the money raised».

In comparison to her col-
leagues in the SGB office,
Munkatchy fairs well. Although

‘ more could have been done, at

least she did achieve the goals
she set out to do in her campaign.
For this she receives a B+.

David Ott. After looking
through the minutes of the SGB
meetings and speaking with the
board members, we are hard
pressed to find anything Ott did
for the students or board.

Ott seemed to realize his lack
of leadership when he told 779e
Pitt News how hard it was to actu-
ally accomplish anything on
Board. “Candidates have to
expect a lot of failure,” he said.
Ott knows this from first-hand
experience.

The Inter-Fraternity Council,
which Ott was liaison to, agrees

that Ott found it hard to get things
done. “I expected someone who
could tell me what SGB could do
for IFC,” IFC president Jeremy
Weiss said. Ott was “fairly ineffec-
tive in his role.as liaison.  We
had planned a couple of meet-
ings, but it never worked out.”

Ott stated four main goals in his
campaign platform: to increase

I safety, expand the computer lab
to North Oakland, increase the
hours of athletic facilities and

improve I313-l.i9r.’§-‘ among  student  For  he

We can’t find anything tangible
he has done.

Overall, Ott was a failure as a
board member. Granted, he does
hold other major leadership posi-
tions in the university and most
likely is pressed for time, but he
knew what his duties. would be
when he ran for the SGB position.

SGB seems to have been purely a .

resume builder for Ott; for this he
receives an F.

Tony Moody. He could also be
called the public relations
spokesperson for hire from the
SGB ofﬁce and also has few defi-
nite accomplishments to point to.

The Bridge of Knowledge project .

was basically in place, Moody
helped promote it. The parking
available at the BioTech lot —
Moody helped promote it, accord-
ing to the Department of Parking

A and Transportation. Registering

bikes with the campus police
department, while a very valid
service, Moody simply helped
promote it.

He did work on solving the
cubicle space problem of the fifth
ﬂoor of the union and did serve
as business manager of the board
which does require a lot of time
with paperwork. But we find it
difficult to point to definite
accomplishments. Moody was not
very specific in his campaign plat-
form as to what projects other
than safety and student apathy he
wanted to focus on, so he cannot
be faulted for falling through on
campaign promises. However, we
feel he could have done more, for
this he receives a D+.

August Imholtz. Imholtz came
into the board saying he would
act as a liaison “between the stu-
dents and the university adminis-

tration.” Through his pledge, he
focusedon a certain project —
bike safety and worked on many

facets of the issue.

Imholtz worked with the Book

Center to get locks and with
Public Safety to get bike registra-
tion. He also helped remove the
waiting list for cubicles in the
union.

But, we still have not seen too
much interaction between him
and the administration withsother
receives a'C-'. ‘ , -

Joe Foner -— fighter against
apathy. Foner did coordinate the
implementation of both a student
discount program and computer-
ized survey progiam. Fonefs dis-
count progiam is a tangible, use-
ful benefit for students.

In his platform, Foner said he
wanted to “eliminate or reduce
causes of apathy.” Students will
soon be able to register their com-
plaints about the university to the
SGB through Telnet in the com-
puter labs. At the beginning of his
term, Foner also conducted writ-
ten surveys in his quest to combat
lack of interest on campus.

Because Foner’s campaign plat-
form was based completely on
fighting apathy, which his projects
reﬂect, he receives a B+.

And board member number
eight, Thomas Grassia.“But when
people care, great things can hap-
pen.  _Our safety is neglected. I
care. Our money is misspent. I
care.  Vote Tom Grassia. Dare to
care," Grassia stated in his plat-
foim.Although Grassia attempted
to form coalitions with off—campus
students and another coalition for
campus religious groups; nothing
substantial ever came from his
efforts.Grassia is yet another
board member we’ve struggled to
find achievements from. Maybe
we should have asked him what
his definition of “care” meant dur-
ing the campaign last year. Our
definition says if you care for

‘something it means you actually

take action to improve it.
Obviously Grassia’s doesn’t hold
the belief ours does. Grassia has
been extremely inactive on board,
for this he receives an F.

Overall, the 1995 SGB can be
classified as a failure

j_0'- I it" it . It  S A A t A ‘I‘HE PI'IT NEWS, Thursday, November 11, 1993,

  The University community is facing a tide of bigotry. Scapegoating,

generalizing, and stereotyping have served as means for solving

  differences rather than good faith, fact-based dialogue. Accusations and

intolerance have increasingly become the norm among groups and

individuals. The University’s policy on discrimination seems more like a

  static document than a guidepost for hrunane conduct. On our campus,

the vision of a democratic America —  a land of equal opportunity, a

marketplace of ideas and ideals, of peaceful coexistence — is being
tested. This cannot be tolerated.

The University needs to take action to ensure that our mosaic, our
diversity is protected. We challenge the University to put forth a
meaningful program that will inform our community that bigotry

threatens equal opportunity and freedom. The administrationshould
seize the moment to sponsor a conference on the issues of bigotry,
racism, and prejudice, that are undermining our sense of community and
our mutual respect.    

WE DEMAND A CALL FOR ACTION !
