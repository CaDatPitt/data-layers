With the naming of Senior Queen, Alma Mater, and ODK

student activities leaders, were climaxed this morning.

Signified by these three presentations as the outstanding mem-
bers in the fields of scholarship, student activities, and character

of this year’s senior class were:

MILDRED EGGE -- Senior Queen.
BETTY JEAN TOBIAS -' Alma Mater.
DONALD WILDE "- ODK Awardee.
These announcements highlighted and concluded the hour-long
program. Thirteen groups participated in thetraditional ceremonies,

advanced this year ahead of

Women's Organizations
Women’s organizations which
tapped members were Cwens, sopho-
more women’s activities sorority;

Mortar Board, honorary national

Druids, men's sophomore acti-

vities fraternity, also rapped new
members this morning.

The Owl, University yearbook,
added 20 senior men and women to
its Hall of Fame. Special awards
also made were the Druids’ sopho-
more award, Thyrsa W. Amos Mem-

son, chairman of the. Nationality
Rooms Council, sends Miss Mar-
tucci to Europe for a summer’s

study at the school of her choice.

Congressmen Elect Greenbe

Titchworth

MC Proxy

Something like a log cabin to
White House story was written
Tuesday when a newly-elected
member was elected president of
Men’s Council.

Roy Titchworth, elected to a
College senior post a few weel<’s
age, succeeds retiring member How-
ard Greenberger as president.

Titchworth however is not a com-
Lplete stranger to student politics
and activities. He has been a mem-
ber of the Ellsworth Council and
Glee Club, chairman of some Ells-
worth Center social events, a mem-
ber of Pitt Players, a Center dele-
gate to Student Congress, and a
member of the Blennd Committee of
A Congress.

Freshman Over Veteran

Titchworth received the nod over
Earl Jacob who was treasurer ‘of
Men’s Council during this session,
president of Druids, and a member
of several other activities.

Dick Richards, veteran member
of Council, was elected Student
Congress representative by a slim
10 to 9 majority. Richards has been
a worker on several Council com-
mittees and is president of Alpha
Phi Alpha social fraternity.

The election for vice president
saw an unusual situation in the
fact that A'lan Goldberg, a Bus Ad

junior representative, and Len
Baker, a College sophomore and
pledge of Goldberg’s fraternity,

opposed each other. Goldberg got
the post. He was chairman of
Council's movie committee in his
first year on Council.

Unanimously Elected

Ralph Thorne and Jack Burwinkel
received the posts of secretary and
treasurer respectively after un-
contested elections. Both are first-
year men on Council.

Roy Nelson, an Education senior,
received the nod as representative
to the publications committee.

According to Trustee by-laws,
the official election will not take

the Trustee Board meets to consider

The polling was held to replace

last three members’ terms expired
this year.

The placing of school alumnus
on the board of trustees was agreed
upon in 1941 by the regular board
of trustees and the alumni group.
This stipulated that 10 former stu-
dents would be elected as nom-
inees by the alumni to serve with
the trustees. These alumni trustees
were placed in three groups of three,
three, and four to be elected yearly
for a three year term.

He was referring to rumors cir-

cerning late Monday calls to the
electing Congress. These sup-
posedly offered political plums in
return for support of Don Ewart.

Grace Saltzman then admitted
receiving such a call. “I was of-
fered the post of secretary,” she
claimed.

Herman Levy, after the meeting,
also admitted receiving a call. “I
told the caller that I was voting
for Greenberger at the very begin-
ning which probably squelched any
offers that might have been forth-
coming,” Levy said.

Goldberg and Knox Named

After the meeting, the callers
were allegedly identified as Alan
(Cookie) Goldberg and Carlton
Knox. Both men have denied the
charge, labelling the calls a poli-
tical smear trick.

Before the names of the callers
had been revealed, Knox asked if
the call to Saltzman had not been
made by a member of Pi Lambda
Phi. He then referred to the tradi-
tional rivalry between Pi Lam and
Phi Epsilon Pi. Goldberg is a Pi
Lam and Greenberger a Phi Ep.

"If any positions were offered,
as Miss Saltzman claims,” said
Ewart, "they were offered without
my knowledge or approval.” He
would have made this clear, he
said, "had I been consulted before

 I categorically deny having con-
tacted Miss Grace Saltzman by
phone or otherwise in an effort
to influence her vote in the re-
cent congressional election. If:
Miss Saltzman was contacted and
my name mentioned, it was an
outright political smear done pos-
sibly _to jeopardize my chances
for an office on Men’s Council.
Common logic will show that I
was ‘in no position to offer Miss
Saltzman any gain as I am not a
member of Congress and I have
no political alignments whatso-
ever with Don Ewart. In conclu-
ion it is my sincere opinion that
_his whole mess, including the
” lleged phone call, was a filthy
olitical maneuver done as an at-
q pt to put a man in office at
-he expense of an innocent party.
it is a long known fact that the
ivalry between the Pi Lams and
Phi Eps is at tim_es bitter. The
finstigator of this maneuver, realiz-
ng this fact, saw an excellent

the. election and charge “dirty
—pOlll'.l'C8” to a rival of Howard
Greenberger's, a Phi Ep. They,
therefore, implicated a Pi Lam
who has had someexperience on
the political front. It was defin-
itely an underhanded frame.

' Perhaps I should quote that lit- ‘
tle piece from Billy Shakespeare’s
"Othello” that little phrase
about "who robs my purse steals
'trash..,...but he who robs me of my
good name...” and so on. But I
don’t need Shakespeare to tell me
that someone who uses another
iperson’s name to achieve some
slimy, political coup is despic-
able, treacherous, immature, and
. lower than a snake pit.

G On Tuesday evening, May 2nd, I
announced at the Student Congress
meeting that I had been contacted
by telephone the previous night
and had been instructed to vote a
certain way. I made it clear (I
hope) that I had no indication that
the candidate in question had any
knowledge of the phone call. In
fact, I believe strongly to this mo-
ment that he had no knowledge
that his name had been used in

gress election banquet. The story begins on Page I.)

stirring up the present controversy.
In fact, I believe that the reason
that phone call was made was not
really to influence me in my vot-
ing, but, for some strange politi-
cal move, was to put the name of
Alan "Cookie” Goldberg in an un-
favorable light.

I substantiate, this theory by
these few points: (1) I have since
talked to Cookie on the phone and
the voices were dissimilar, (2) The
person who called me knew that I
would become incensed at the dirty
political angle and, knowing me,
realized that I would put it before
Congress in an attempt to clear up
the matter, and (3) In my talk at

‘the dinner I did not mention Mr.
Goldberg's name, yet by 8:30 a.m.
the following morning it was all
over school that the culprit who
had called me was Mr. Goldberg.
Therefore, the slick impersonator
(who did not try tooswear me to
secrecy, by the way) had already
spread the news himself.

I do not as yet know why this
despicable trick was pulled al-
though I have my own ideas on the
subject. I only know that a person
(and Iluse the word loosely) who
supposedly has the maturity to be
in college has used‘Mr. Goldberg's
name in a cowardly attempt at poli-
tical maneuvering.

I am sincerely sorry for the part
I have had in this affair, butI
still will not let regrets of any
nature deter me in taking any
steps which will in any way, des-

troy the bugboo of political
scheming at Pitt.
My deepest sympathy to Mr.

Goldberg; but then, you never know

, when you might be rubbing shoul-

ders with a louse like the one who
used his‘ name.

‘After Graduation? -IGBYEDAVE WEI‘ »

 

Most students in Group A in the College are» taking pre-law or
_pre-graduate school courses. Shunting these people aside for a
minute let's consider the -job opportunities for the old-fashioned
liberal arts student, the man who believes in a "well-rounded

education.”

Is the growing flood of graduates
cheapening the value of a college
education?

-Stanton C. Crawford, dean of the

College, doesn’t think so. He feels

With tempers still short and charges of ‘dirty politics’ still
flying over the recent student elections, students are comparing
ideas on whether the open campaigning common to other camp-I

uses should be allowed atlPitt:

‘ Phyllis Beck, Education 50:
"Under the ideal situation, no, be-
cause a person should be elected
on his qualifications. In campaign-
ing candidates so often compro-
mise themselves.”

Mary Pat Bartimore, College 52:
"It would heighten school spirit
and bring out more pep and vitality
It would encourage the candidates
to show their initiative.”

Phil DuPrie st, Engr. 53: “I’d
like to see a good hand shaking,
back slapping campaign.”

Mike J. _ Millas, Bus. Ad. 50:
"The average student doesn’t know
who or what his vote is for. Cam-
paigning would give the students a
better chance to know their candi-
date’s standards and the future
policies of the school.”

It would mean better representa-_
tion, for the individual could ex-
press his point of view through his
candidate.”

Carol Smith, College 52: "I
don’t think it is necessary. It
would certainly lower the high

political standing that the women’s
elections have now.”

Mary Grace Munn, College 51:
“Yes, definitely. All students, not
just the minority, have a right to
know whom they are voting for and
for what these people stand.”

"Candidates should get down
here in the Tuck Shops and make it
known what they stand for and what
they are going to do.” ‘ M

Rosemary Parlak, College 50:
"Yes. They have a lot of fun doing
it over at Tech, I don’t see why we
can’t.”

Jim neitzman, College 53:
"Many good men have lost posts
and died unknown because they
couldn’t campaign.”-

Jimpliarcher, College, 50: "It
should be left as it is. If a person
is good, he is recognized without
campaigning.”

Gerry Yonakas, Education 50:

“Yes, because most people don’t
know who is up until they walk up
to vote.”

 

Wendell Hoop, College 50: “Yes
as long as it wouldn't get too poli-
tical and partisan. The voters
should get the background on their.
candidates.” _

Marion Ford, College 50: “It
would create more interest in the
elections and in school poli-
cies, and it would get more stu-
dents put to vote.”

Paul Malmberg, Graduate School:
“It is advantageous ‘to both c_an-
didate and voter. It gives a better
basis for forming an opinion of a
candidate, and it gives the can-
didate a better idea of his obliga-
tions and responsibilities.” I

;"It keeps the candidate on his
'toes, and lets the voter see
whether the office-seeker is just
a figurehead or a real leader.” I

and in writing.

Writing majors in journalism here
have been very successful in getting
jobs though the field is over-crowded
and contracting. Beginners face
low pay and irregular hours, but
they get jobs. .

Leads and recommendations from L

Robert X. Graham, head of the
journalism division and president
of Pi" Delta Epsilon, national hon-
orary journalism fraternity, have
proved valuable aids for students
seeking ‘employment.

Vets Get Preference

Veterans majoring in government
service who can keep up the 2. av-
erage demanded will get a point
bonus in their scores when they
take civil service exams, apro-
vision which will make it rough
for any non-vet trying to compete). ,

Graduate work is practically a-.

must for majors in foreign lang-
’uages,_ fine arts, and the social

sciences. As the student puts
more and more schooling behind
him, his potential salary ceiling
goes up.

A bachelor's degree for an econ-
omist, for instance, is the bare
minimum. _It will qualify an appli-l
cant.for a starting job in federal
service. He needs at least an M.A.,
preferably a F’h.D\., for advance-
ment in academic, government, or
industrial fields. ’ ‘

Lawyers Face Fight

Pre-law students can look for-
ward to stiff competition. Swollen
law-school enrollments will cause
serious over-crowding for the next
two to three years, according to
the U.S. forecast, and for the next
five to ten years, according to an-
other well-informed estimator.

Probably only‘the best-qualified
newcomers will be really success-
ful because population growth;
deaths and retirements (4-5,000
yearly) just won’t.provide enough
openings to absorb the surplus.

Specialists in tax, patent, and
admiralty law will be better off
than their brother attorneys in the
long run, but positions for special-
ists are scarce, usually found only
with big law firms in the larger
cities.

.Training Is Valuable

The man with a bachelor’s de-
gree in the social sciences is
tough to place, according to C.H.
Ebert ]r., head of the University
Placement Service. But toughest
of all to place are the pre-law, pre-
med, and‘ pre—dent students who
can't qualify for the school of their
choice.

gakland District  
or Forensic Finals

The annual Pennsylvania Forensic and Music League contests
are in their second day, and 6000 students from 157 high schools
are swarming over the Oakland district. . '

Forthe first time in 18 years the league is holding its 70 mus-
ical events and 14 speech events in Pittsburgh. L

Viers Adams, director of Ells-
worth Center, and E. A. Batchelder
assistant registrar of the Univer-
sity, who head the housing com-
mittee, have employed Ellsworth
Center, Schenley High School,
Falk Elementary School, Logan
Armory, and the gymnasiums in
the stadium and the Cathedral as
temporary quarters.

Plenty of space

Pitt, Duquesne, and Carnegie In-
stitute have volunteered space for
the contests. Ellsworth field will
be used as a parade ground for
competing bands on Saturday. A

Duquesne has volunteered its
FM radio facilities for the broad-
casting competition. The balcony
of the Hall of Dinosaurs in Carne-
gie Institute is being used for the
display of wildlife conservation
posters.

In addition several Oakland
buildings and unused Pitt class-
rooms are being used for debates
and musical events.

According to Lynn’ W. Thayer,
executive secretary of the league,
about 12 student aides are needed
for the remainder of the contests.

Aides Needed

Aides need only work during
their spare time; classes will not
be excused for those who volunteer.
Anyone interested may contact the
league headquarters at Frick Ele-
mentary Training School by calling
MUseum 1-8209.

Information concerning the loca-
tion and time of the events may be

Songs Waxed

By Musicians

Record collectors can now add to
their collections songs of Pitt done
for the first time by Pitt's own musi-
cal groups.

The University concert band and
the Men’s Glee Club have combined
to produce "Songs of Pitt,” an al-
bum made up of three IO-inch unbreak-
able records. The albums include
"Panther Song,” "Hail To Pitt,”
“Victory Song,” “Chant,” "Battle
Song,” and "Alma Mater.”

This is the first time since the
founding_ of the University in 1787
that.record albums ofPitt songs have
been made by Pitt musical organiza-
tions. Two years- ago the first al-
bum of Pitt songs was recorded by a
New York glee club. ‘

The albums cost. $3.50 or if they
are mailed, $3.75. They may be bought
from members of the band, Glee
Club, Cwens, the Student Desk,
University Book Store, or by mail
order to the dean of men's office,
in care of William F. saalbach.

According to Mr. Thayer, most
of the events are free and everyone
is welcome.

‘ Extensive Library

There are 2500 records in the li-
brary--from Grieg to Gershwin-and‘,
they are available to all students,
and faculty members for listening ‘
and study. P A p 

The records cannot be borrowed
overnight or taken out for any length
of time like library books, but the.
listening rooms provide an excellent
place to hear the great symphonies. I

Dr. «Theodore Finney, head of the
department, believes that more stu-
dents ought ‘to visit the music li-
brary and get "hep” to Beethoven,
Mozart, and the other masters.

"I guarantee that once you hear a
Haydn symphony you’ll forget guys
like Dorsey , Monroe, and Goodman,"
says Dr. Finney.

Favorite Pastime

Sitting in one of the music‘ rooms-
with a group of students is one of
Dr. Finney’s favorite pastimes. He
likes the role of symphonic disc-
jockey for it gives him an opportunity
to answer questions about the music,
explain outstanding passages in a
symphony, and comment on the great \
classical composers. L

The past several years Ravel’si
‘fBolero” has been the most popular
selection among the students. Cho-

Korsakov’s "Scheherazade” are in ,

‘Kim Dawson’ Fine Nobel of Oil Town

BY JACK MARKOWITZ

Western P ennsylvania once

had oil towns as booming and

lusty as those of the West, and, after reading Amy Fox’s "Kim
Dawson,” the reader is apt to wonder why no othéhaovel has been
written about the flush days of the Pennsy oil boom.

This fertile soil was just waiting to be turned, and Amy Fox

has plowed straight and true.

Mrs. Fox’s boom town, Pithole,
is a roaring, spreading every-man-
for-himself town. The black gold
has built it overnight into a forest
of oil derricks hovering over what
has become the third largest city
in Pennsylvania.

Hastily Built

The burly teamsters and derrick
men, who carry in the wrinkles of
their weather-beaten faces the
everepresent oil they seek, live
in shacks and tents hastily thrown
up in the shadow of the derricks.

What streets there are turn to
muddy rivers during the frequent
downpours. Down-in the center of
are a jail, a few stores, and

the popularity poll. Beethoven, Schu-Q
bert, andTschaikovsky are traditiona ,
favorites. P

women nervously hurry past.

And over all, the pounding of
the derrick engines, the hoarse
cries of the teamsters, the lum-
bering roll of their overloaded
wagons, and the raucous singing
and laughter echoing up from Dan
Mulroy’s.

To the bustling city of Pithole
just at the, close of the Civil War
come Lance Dawson, a Confede-
rate soldier with a head wound
which can’t seem to heal, and his
strong-willed young wife‘.Kim,
who walks as if she were Mrs.

Kim, looking on in fear and an-

ant with a well-placed mattock
handle behind the ear. Thus Kim,
for better or worse, obtains lasting

reputation in Pithole.

This incident is the source of
Kim's future troubles and the be-

her and her husband.

Victory

Easy One

By DAVE GROTJOHAN

The usual grade of ‘slow pitch-_
ing and an onslaught of runs per-
sisted as the Non-Nomens, by way
of errors, knockedoff the DeSoto
nine, 13-5, at Ellsworth Center
Wednesday.

The game almost promised to be
an exciting contest. After three
innings had passed the Non-Nomens
had but a one run lead. Then the
sloppy play began, and the losers
fumbled their opponents to three
more runs.

To add a little more insurance to
this bemused victory, the DeSoto

boys handed the Non-Nomens four
more runs in the sixth on a grand
slam error.

The final tally showed the name-
less nine also outhitting their op-
ponents, 11-7.

His intellectual abilities can prove

John Kountz Sets Fast
Pace in Track, Classes

In one of his classes, Johnny took a
test on "which he felt he didn’t do
too well. When the instructor returned
the papers, he announced that one
person in the class made a perfect
score which had thrown the distri-
bution of grades away off balance.
"I felt pretty mad at the guy who
fouled everybody up when I heard
that,” says Johnny, "but when I
got my paper back, I shut up pretty
.quick. Mypaper was the perfect one.”

‘Runningest’ Trackman

Known as one of the ‘runningest’
thinclads on the Pitt team, Kountz
puts in three hours daily at the Sta-
dium track, and also works out in
Mount Lebanon on Saturdays and
Sundays with his running mate and
high school buddy, Dick Firsching.

Johnny usually gets his stiffest
competition from teammate Firsching,
rather than from opponents. In the
Miami meet this year, Firsching
edged Kountz in the 440 in 50.6
seconds.

Johnny is looking forward_t0 to-
mori-ow’s Notre" Dame meet, for he
thinks the Panthers have a good
chance to upset the visitors.

State Champ

“We'll have to be on, though, to
do it,” he says. "I wouldn't doubt
that the last race, the mile relay,
decides the outcome.” Kountz runs
second on Pitt’s mile relay team.

While in high school, Kountz won
state championships both in the 220
and 440.

Softball Agenda

Softball on the Pitt campus is not
necessarily a man’s game. The Wo-
men's Athletic Assn. is sponsoring
a softball program every Wednesday,
2:30 to 4:30 p.m., at Masonic Field
behind Oakland's Masonic Temple.

Chairman for the softball is Lou-
ise Mallinger, who eventually ex-
pects to have some sort of a league
within the WAA. All women are wel-
come to join in. Warmup sessions
and rule clinics are currently on the
agenda. . 

McCormick Optimistic

Coach Dave McCormick expects
his charges to improve their sad
record of last season. The P-anthers
dropped all three matches, giving
only Army trouble, as the Cadets
won a close 4-3 verdict.

A seven-man team, led by Cap-
tain Bob Reilly, will compose Pitt's
entry. Veteran Andy Mihocko will
be absent from the squad due to
schedule difficulties in Dental
School. A

A , Tech Next

Aside from Reilly, the remainder
ofthe travelling squad willbe James
Cox, Bob Andres, Myron Schwartz,
Blaine Helner, Hugh Anderson, and
Bill Stitt. ,

On Wednesday, May 10,.Pitt en-
gages Carnegie Tech at the Pitts-
burgh Field Club. The Panthers
last met the Tartans in 1942, with
the local squad scoring a 9-0 vic-
tory.

 

CARL DEPASQLTA, Pitt fullback

Personal Conferences

End Writers ’ Con fab

The fifth annual Western Pennsylvania Conference for Writers

finishes up this afternoon with personal cortferences between stu-

dents and speakers.
The conferences will begin

at 2:30, and any students yet

wishing to register for any of them should do so in the information

room on the first floor. The visit-

ing speakers- who will conduct con-
ferences this afternoon are William
G. Avirett, Walter I Br dbury, Mar-
tha F019)’: Mrs. Amy Fox, and Alle'n
Tate.

The writer conference got under
way yesterday morning when Mr.
Avirett, educational editor of the
New York Herald-Tribune, and Mr.
Bradbury, managing editor of the
publishing house of Doubleday and
Company, spoke on aspects of writ-'
ing with which they are familiar.

This morning at 9:30 these speak-
ers, together with Allen Tate, and
Lawrence Lee, associate professor
of English at Pitt, participated in
a forum on the general subject ‘”If
I Were You.” '

‘Kim Dawson’

Good N oviel

(Cont. fromiPage 3)
2 times-, the author is at her best.

Understandingly Told

One especially fine part is the
first lecture before a newly-formed
ladies club made up of simple rus-
tic women whose men have struck
it rich. Trying to live up to their
new riches, they sit politely in
expensive Paris gowns before
"Francois,” the great chef from
New York’s’finest hotel, as he
discusses the new dishes.

Just at the end of the chef's
demonstration, the ladies are
asked to refreshments. Forgetting
their cloak of gentility, the wo-
men charge in a body for the foods
prepared and make off with them.

This is told with an impressive
depth of understanding and warmth.
Mrs. Fox is a sympathetic writer
throughout her story and iii such
places especially.

There are also in "Kim Dawson”
certain sections which do not at-
tain the effect of reality and cre-
dibility‘ necessary to be apprecia-
ted. And sometimes the dialogue
is a bit stilted and lacking in
naturalness. But these are small
things for the most part.

Good Effect,

'The author does inaugurate an
excellent means of retelling the
unsfpjokten thoughts of the characters
She eliminates such phrases as
“he reflected” or "thought Kim”
by placing unspoken thoughts in
italics. lt’s a good effect.

Mrs. Amy Fox has written a good
novel, which honestly recreates
the spell of a little-known era.
That is the real accomplishment in
"Kim Dawson.”
