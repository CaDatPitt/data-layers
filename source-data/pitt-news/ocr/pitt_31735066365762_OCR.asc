Forum to publish
"Litchfield Papers”

Freed of an injunction prohibiting publication of the so-called Litch-
field Papers,the Pittsburgh Form today ‘said it would publish the report
in its next issue.

The injunction, issued last week by Common Pleas Court Judge
Richard T. Wentley, was revoked yesterday when the heirs of former
Pitt Chancellor Edward H. Litchfield withdrew their objections to pub-
lication of the six-year old document, which apparently-blames the
city’sfinanciers and former Pitt trustees for the school’s financial fail-

family. -

Law school graduates increase

  Law market tightens

by RICK EULER

A job shortage facing law stu-
dents who will graduate this year
may grow to alarming propor-
tions in the near future.

According to an article by Fred
P. Graham in the Feb. 6 New
York Times, “the country’s law
schools are turning out graduates
at more than twice the rate of a
decade ago and that even at the
present rate, which is expected to
accelerate, the size of the legal
profession will double by 1985. "

Graham pointed out that although

the Department of Labor esti-
mates the average number of
openings for law students will be
14,500 per year until 1980, the an-
nual rate of graduates will have
reached 30,000 by 1974.

Two reasons are cited by Gra-
ham for this sudden interest in the
legal profession. First, he said, as

the job market soured, especially '

in the fields of science and teach-
ing, it became fashionable for
young people to consider law as a
way of affecting change within the
system.

And, Graham added. ‘it; became
widely publicized several years
ago that new lawyers were break-
ing in at salaries of up to $18,000
per year, giving the profession a
glamorous aura.

Associate Dean John Sciullo of
the Duquesne University Law
School agreed with Graham's
gloomy forecast.

Education Seminar draws many

“I think that upon completion‘
of their undergraduate work,
many young people feel that the
best way to contribute to society
is to study law. It seems to be the
relevant thing,” he said.

William E. Sell, Dean of Pitt’s
Law School, noted another reason
for the sudden interest in the legal
profession. ‘

"I think you’ll f'ind that when
economic conditions are down, as
they have been recently,” he said,
"law school enrollments are up.
This was especially_ true during
the Depression.” i ‘

As a result of these factors,
wrote Graham, the, American Bar
Association (A-BA) fears the rise
of three major problems:

'——The legal profession could/be
torn by a controversy over
whether to_ try to‘ limit the.num-
ber of people permitted to be-
come lawyers each year;

—An overabundance of lawyers
might increase unethical prac-
tices among lawyers in the race
for clients, and

—Thousands of young people un-
able to find work may turn
against. the system that shut
them out. -' '

In addition, the situation is af-
fecting the nation’s 147 accredited
law schools, which, according to
Graham,“are able to take fewer
than one-half of those who enroll.”

Sell, however, said that the

ure as a private institution.

The objectionswere withdrawn at a hearing before Wentleyi preci-
pitated by the broadcast of portions of the Litchfield Papers by WJAS
radio and a local television news program.

Bill Rodd, ‘Forum writer who said he prepared the
the late Litchfield shortly after he resigned as Pitt’s Chancellor, dis
closed parts of the document to the media. « »

4 At the hearing, the Litchfield family claimed common law copy-
right to the document and requested that Rodd be prevented from fur- *
ther publicly disclosing the document.

When Wentley said he ‘could not consider any requests until he had‘
thoroughly. studied the report, it appeared as though no immediate deci-
sion would be reached.

During_a brief adjournment, however, representatives of the Litch- .
fields agreed to withdraw their objections upon the condition that the
Forum print with the document an official statement by the Litchfield

Under the agreement, this statement will be “prominently display— .
ed",in the paper. Members of the Litchfield family would not say what
the statement might contain. ,

According to the Associated Press, the segment of the report read
on WJAS "concludes that Pitt's trustees. a'small band of small-minded

men, at home in their world of steel, money and horses. balked at

change, challenge. innovation and ideas"and refused to give Litchfield
the money to upgrade the University."

“The report,” said the AP, “details how Alan Scaife, brother-in-
law of financier Richard King Mellon (late) and then chairman of Pitt’s

trustees, brought Litchfield to the University by promising that the
board would raise $200,000,000 to make it ‘a great university.”’ ' .

problem might abate as students
become aware of the tight law job
market.

“Students aren‘t going to rush
to a profession that’s hard to get.
into,” he said. “It’s a type of sup-
ply-demand situation.”

But, said the AP, the report drew a picture of‘ Mellon’s cooling to.
Scaife”s idea, his lead being followed by many of Pittsburgh’s financial
elite, who perhaps feared Litchfield‘s accretion of influence, and Pitts
trustees, who eventually blamed the schools woes on Litchfield.

"'By placing the blame on Litchfield."’ the AP quoted the report,
“they saved their own face and that of the Mellons, who had initially
led Litchfield up the primrose path.”

WHB survey heratesrSzaho food

H by LINDA SAVAGE
, " A survey conducted by Women’s Housing
Board indicates that many dorm students are dis:—
satisfied with Szabo Food Service.

Results of the survey, including /statistics and
specific comments, are being sent to the Chancel-

lor, Director of University Housing, John Vrana,’

Szabovatr Pitt and its national headqua.rters, and
other officials, in hopes that some action will be
taken to improve the service and the quality of the
food. » .

The survey, conducted Wednesday evening,

Feb.» 2, consisted of a mimeographed sheet listing

the dishes served anddescriptive adjectives after.

each dish. For example, after roast pork loin and
meat loaf with gravy were the adjectives, fatty,
greasy, tender, tough, dry, cold, hot, overcooked,
undercooked, and well prepared.

Of the students responding, 74 per cent describ-
ed the roast pork loin as tough, and 75 percent
thought it fatty or greasy. Meat loaf was generally
considered tough and cold. I

An equal number of diners found the apple
sauce. whipped potatoes, and corn hot as found them
cold. About 44 per cent of the respondents described
desserts as stale. ' ' ’

‘One student commented, “The meat loaf tasted

5

more like bread filler than meat.” Said another,‘ _
“The entire meal was likeithe seat on a Crosstown H

bus with a little salt.” _ '

Besides the food itself, respondents seemed
generally dissatisfied with the service and sanita-
tion. Many students commented that the food wasn't
ready on time. “I had to wait 40 days and nights in
line’; said one.

Others complained that there was a food short-
age after 6 p.m."God help anyone who comes after
6,” complained one.

Some diners contended that when. they com-
plained about the conditions to Szabo Food Service,
they were ignored. “I have gone back to the office
to complain,” said one, “and every time they blame
it on someone else.”

-Numnerous complaints cited employees not ad-
hering to health regulations.

“Help,” suggested one student, “should be in-
structed not to lick their fingers when serving food.”

“Duringone meal I saw one of the help pour a”

dirty bucket full of orange drink in with a quantity
of lime drink already in the
another.

At the end of the survey, WHB advised students
to get better food service: “Complain to the man-
agers until you get satisfaction, you pay for it.”

seniors could be seen frantically looking for help
in choosing a career at the Career Seminar Series

r;*iCo’mmuniist candidate
 seeks ballot placement

by LINDA SAVAGE '
The Communist Party candidate for vice—president of the US. des-

, cribed his party’s campaign as an introduction of the party to Ameri-
scans.

Jarvis Tyner called his election drive _"a great opportunity to
introduce to a lot of people where the Communist Party really stands in
the struggles of people against racism. war. a-nd exploitation. at a

Tyner, 32 year old chairman of the Young Workers Liberation

 League, was in town to kick off the Communist Party‘s efforts to se-
V ‘ cure spots on the Pennsylvania ballot for himself and Party Presiden-

" . tial candidate Gus Hall. ~
‘ To earn placement on the ballot, the party must obtain 37,000 sig- _ \

natures in the three week period between today and March 7.
The ballot campaign in’ Pennsylvania is part of the Communist

’ » Party’s_ efforts to win places on the ballots of 30 states. The party has
.; won a place on Ohio’s ballot. ’

“We don’t think this is the year the Communist Party is going to

I‘ win,” he said, “but we think that we can get a good vote and help to

affect the issues and the whole campaign by presenting real alterna-

ll ‘ ’tives to what the other candidates present."

.Tyner said his platforms calls for closing down U.S. bases all

V _ ' over the world and padlocking the Pentagon, FBI, and CIA. It also in-
‘ cludes plans for massive housing, job creation, recreation facilities,

“Though we can make changes today, ultimately we are going to

« have to change the whole system,” he said.

A belated letter containing out-

services at the Student Health
Service has developed into a

Ecology project cited

Contrary to thestereotyple of the biology major surrounded by re-

. search. artifacts,-and test tubes, Philip Gelacek is for the people and

the environment.

Gelacek. a junior bio major, received a $100 nationwide honorable
mention from Manpower, Inc., as a result of his survey on pollution.
His report studied the effect of two small streams as contributors
to pollution of the Allegheny River. The study was done in his hometown
of Kittanning, Pa.. 50 miles from campus.

“People are realizing that these small sewers play as large a role
in polluting the environment as do the large corporations,” said Gelacek.

Active in several environmental quality organizations, including
the Southwestern Pennsylvania Development Program, Gelacek was
recently appointed to the Appalachian Regional Commission Youth Ed-
ucation Task Force. y_

Last December, he met in Alabama with students and advisers
f'rom all states. "We are formulating ideas to sponsor a youth program
this summer for students to work on ecology to topics in the Applachian
region,“ he said. *

Good snow abets ski trip

Stiff” muscles and one broken leg failed to dampen the enthusiasm-
of Pitt Ski Club members whoenjoyed an outing in New York last week-
end. ,

65 skiers from Pitt and other schools left Thursday for the three-
day weekend at the Bluemont ski area in New York. The trip to Blue-
mont was the second sponsored by the Ski Club.‘ _

Club President Brian Chambers said that the skiing was generally
better than last year. Other club veterans agreed, and added that this
year’s larger turnout heightened the trip’s success. ~

Skiing conditions Friday morning were excellent, abetted by a
small crowd. Though warmer temperatures slowed Saturday’s skiing
somehwat, a dance and party that night at the ski lodge finished the day
in true apres ski atmosphere.

, A heavy wet snow Sunday forced ma-ny of the skiers indoors, where
they were entertained by singing and guitar playing.

and any consultation with a spe-
cialist. $5.

It also states that patients
will be billed later instead of being
obliged to pay immediately.

The actual policy includes the
option of cash or charge. If cash
is paid, the aforementioned rates
apply; if the student desires to
delay payment, an additional dol-
lar is required.

The increase is designed to cov-
er billing costs.

Director of the "Health Service
Joseph Hinchliffe said that the let-
ter, dated Dec. 29. 1971. had been
drafted before the finalization of
the changes.

“We had the details worked out
in part and told them (Central
Printing) to put a hold on it,” he
recalled.

“The letter was cancelled," ex-
plained the perplexed Hinchliffe.
noting that a Jan. 7 Pitt News arti-
cle did contain the correct infor-
mation outlining the policy
changes. '

Prior to the modifications. no
charges were levied. The fees
were introduced as a stopgap
measure designed to end deficit
spending resulting from rising’
medical costs, increasing student
demands, and a budget decrease.

Hinchliffe surmised that some-
one in Central Printing had appar-
ently examined old orders; no-
ticed the letter, and carried
through the original request. '

Hinchliffe stressed that he would
investigate the matter further, if
possible.

The craze to transfer the sup-
posedly antiquated sound of
Bach’s music into a more rele-
vant artistic expression via syn-
thesizers,‘rock groups, and “heavy
organ" programming has struck
again with lamentable results.

The latest manifestation of
modernized Bach comes to us
through the aspirations and in-
spirations of R. J. Benninghoff
in his new recording entitled"
Benninghoff’s Church Bach.

Through the medium of a rock
“orchestra" equipped with every-
thing from guitars and saxophones
to pianos and rocksichord
(this is not an error), we are led
through a series of grotesque in-
strumental arrangements includ-
ing various choral, instrumental,’
and organworks which Bach wrote
for use in the Christian Church.

That Benninghoff fits’his en-
tire rendition of both the “Saint
Matthew Passion" and “The B
Minor Mass’ into seven minutes
(both works combined last well
over four and a half hours) gives
one an idea of the type of record-
ing this is.

=rBlack Studies

by SHARON SEXTON

After attending ten Black Studies classes
at the University, reporter Sharon Sexton
offers the following perceptions.

An opinion poll of white undergrad-

? , uates concerning the Black Studies De-
» partment here at Pitt might demonstrate,

that they hold many misconceptions.

One ‘common claim is, that with few
exceptions, only black students enroll in
Black Studies courses. Actually there is
a_fairly even balance of blacks and whites
in most classes, while in some there are

' more whites than blacks.

Many students in these courses are
not .Black Studies majors or minors. A
large portion of the class is made up of
students who are cross—registering, tak-
ing a course in the Black Family for cred-
it toward their sociology major, or a
course in the Nigerian World as a sup-
plement to their history major.

Attendance at a few Black Studies
courses will also prove them virtually de-
void of the inflamed rhetoric and counter-
racism with which they are credited by
many whites. The course content is ex-
tremely academic, ranging from discus-
sions of the caste system in India to the

'Qistence or non-existence of a black
I d

ialect. In other courses, the subject

material is slightly more controversial,
concentrating on the development of a
black consciousness. -

In these discussions there are two
sentiments commonly expressed by both
students and teachers:

1) That American society is racist and
that this racism is imbedded in all its
institutions, and

2) That the black man should not become
an "ordinary” middle-class Ameri-
can, that he should maintain his black-
ness.

These two points are agreed upon by
both the black and white students. The
next logical step would be. to arrive at a
workable solution for this racism and the
tendency to “Americanize” the black
man. It is at this point that a gap between
most black and white students develops
and the exchange ofideas ceases.

The position held by most black stu-
dents revolves around the black man’s ne-

cessity to “get it all together” both in---

dividually and collectively before there
can be any hope of harmony between
blacks and whites. .

,, Black Professor Rob Penny teaches
in his Black Consciousness course that
"the only way to restore our people to
their natural greatness‘? is by following

Racial separatism must be
Challenged in the Classroom

the “Seven Principles.”

According to the Seven Principles, the
Black man must be in harmony within
himself, his house, his community, his
neighborhood, his nation, and his race in

, thatorder before he can reach the sev-.

enth level of unity—-the world. It is Pen-
ny’s belief, and the belief of many of his
students, that the black man can only
achieve this harmony alone, without the
interference of ‘any white person in his
home, community, etc. ’

. When asked by a student how the ideas
of interracial dating and marriage fit in
with the Seven Principles, Penny replied‘
that they don’t. It is his belief, and the be-
lief of many of the students in his class,
that this type of relationship between
blacks and whites can only cause division
within the black community.

The white reaction to this separatist
position isvaried, although basically pro-
integration.

A few students readily accept the black

man’s desire to isolate himself.

’ Others see it as a rejection. of their at.-
tempts at reform. They leave the class-
room bitterly muttering as one student
did, "Black students don’t want to be
equal to white people, they want to be
better!”

Many white students are honest about
their dislike of separatism. They believe
that separatism will only create antagon-
sim and suspicion between the two races
as it has in the past. They view the divi-
sion witnessed on the Pitt campus in stu-
dent organizations, at football games, in
the dorms and the gap they believe it has
created between blacks and whites. as a
testimonial to the bankruptcy of separa-
tism.

' White students claim that their argu-
ment receives little consideration by
either black teacher or student. They
maintain that most blacks have decided
in favor of separatism and that any argu-
ing on their part is futile.

It is easy to sympathize with this sense
of futility. One would hope, however, that

"this frustration would not cause the white

student to widen with his silence the al-
ready existing gap between the races.-

Only through the open and honest ex-
change of ideas can any progress be made
toward a better life for people of both
races.

The Black Studies courses offer the

opportunity to all students to take cog-

utions.‘

I Traditionally stale as a twice

‘" ‘frozen TV dinner, the bulk of tele-

_'vision programming is rarely in-
’ novative or ingenious.

.- ._ Each year only a few fresh ideas
surface. Some of these prove eco- ..
  nomically feasible and are retain- -

ed. Other equally worthwhile but
not as fortunate, are committed
to the never-never land of film
vaults and erased videotape, while
their creators join unemployment

But in the past several years a .

 .' showcase for quality entertain-

ment has appeared in the Public

‘ ‘Broadcasting System, a network
' ‘formed from the stations which

were previously part of National

Congress, maintained by charity
and supporting a cultural elitism
reaching only a few intellectuals
(or pseudointellectuals). T00 of-
~ ten scheduling consisted of dry
lectures by ancient professors

whose efforts were probably more
beneficial to chronic insomniacs
than to the unfortunates who were
forced to “attend” their lectures.
Daytime educational shows
served only to relieve bored pub-

lic school children andtheir teach- V

ers from their daily tedium. How
well I remember the great times

we had when Miss Applegate’

switched off the lights to facilitate
clear viewing; although the flick-
ering screen was anything but the
center of attention.

In the past several years, new
life was breathed into the tired
formats of educational television
by the creation of the. Public
Broadcasting System._ This new
network, combining the program-
ming potential of nearly all the
non profit television stations in
America, began to fulfill its poten-
tial and offer some serious com-
petition to the commercial net-
works.

New series such as The Great
American Dream Machine, Mas-
terpiece Theater, Sou1!, The Ad-
vocates, Sesame Street, The
French Chef, Toy That Grew Up
(a silent film anthology) and
Film Odyssey are attracting more
and more attention from critics
and the public.

Soull, a New York. variety_ show
produced especially for black’

viewers is a clearoexample of the,

new breed of series which would
never have appeared on the com-
mercial networks. Its pleasing
balance of entertainment and seri-
ous discussion draws.a large per-
centage of the black audience.
PBS has taken the lead in pre-
senting plays which violate the ‘old
taboos keeping commercial net-

works in their lockstep. Master-~

piece Theater, an English import,
was one of the first series on
American television to display
any (Horrors!) nudity; The bare-
skin appeared in the hilarious
Cold Comfort Farm, a farce on
the concept of the moral purity of
hicks. Other notable dramas in
the series included Jude the Obs-
cure and The Six Wives of Henry
‘VIII. Last Sunday the first part
of a six weeks series depicting the
life of Queen Elizabeth was aired,
-starring Glenda Jackson, the
winner of last year’s academy
award. And it was just last year
that the education network dared
to screen Peter Brook’s contro-
versial film version of Marat/
Sade.

Meanwhile, PBS continued _to
fulfill its traditional role of pre-
senting classical cultural events
such as operas, art and book re-
views,and plays. In late 1971

- PBS begandistriibuting the Bri-

tish Broadcasting Company se-

ries Civilization, under the direc-.

tion of Lord Kenneth Clark. Un-

, fortunately Clark’s condescending
attitude insulted some ‘viewers

who were unwilling to have their
weekly dose of culture served to
them on a sterling silver spoon.

The Great American Dream
Machine is probably the best new
American variety series to ap-
pear on television for years. It
combines singing, dancing, edi-
torializing, film featurettes, car-
toons, and dramatic segments in

.. a way that is not always terribly

effective but which is always sur-
prising and entertaining. A typical

Dream Machine hour may in-

clude such features as a portion
of [Bernstein’s Mass performed
by the original company, a sports

interview with baseball player.

Satchel Paige concerning his ad-
mission to baseball’s Hall of
Fame, Elaine Stritch singing a se-
lection from the hit Broadway
play Company, a featurette star-
ring Tiny Tim on nostalgia, and a
special" on the current American
attitude on the Vietnam War or
marital infidelity. The viewer
never knows what to expect when
he sits down to an hour of Dream
Machine.

The Advocates offers viewers a
chance to consider controversia_l

A very popular

issues in an intelligent manner.
Two sides of important political
questions are presented by /staffs
of players with some of the top
experts as witnesses. The verdict

is left to the public, but the po:

litical impact of the series is not
to be underrated.

The silent film anthology which . '-

is currently underway has proved
with the older
crowd, who welcomethese pieces
of nostalgia, and with the younger
people, who are surprised at the
quality of some of these oldies.
When WQED aired D. W. Grif-
fith’s Intolerance several weeks
ago many surprised film fans dis-
covered that experimental films
are a little’ older than Orson
Wells’ The Magnificent Amber-
sons. -

Film Odyssey, a collection of
critically acclaimed films of the
past is currently being shown on
WQED every Saturday nights.
Films such as Trouffaut’s Jules
and Jim, Kurasawa’s The Seven
Samurai, and Polanski’s Knife in
the Water are included in the se-
ries. ‘ ' ‘

So if, commercial programming
fails to suit your taste, non—prof—
it broadcasting serves plenty of
gourmet fare for discriminat-
ing viewers.

Schneewind scored for allusion to fraternities

Editor:
On Feb. 6, the Pittsburgh Press

‘ran an article related to the term

paper business. The business is
nothing new and has been in op-
eration for some years now. How-
ever, it -has been harshly criti-
cized by deans as well as other
members of the education sys-
tem. One of its critics is Dean
Schneewind of the CAS who said,
“It’s the commercialization of an
old campus tradition. It also
equalized opportunity — now ev-
erybody can cheat, not j_ust those
in fraternities or with the right
friends.”

This is an unduly harsh criti-
cism, blaspheming fraternities as

_ a whole. His accusation or opin-
3 ion _is completely unfounded. If -
I, the Dean had taken some time -to

It is unfair of a man of Dean
Schneewind’s position to make
such a remark which degrades
fraternities as a whole, suggest-
ing that a component part of fra-
ternities is an organized system
of cheating. This is not true, as I
have pointed out, for everybody

time before he makes a remark,
he should consider all the possible
ramifications ‘of such a statement
and how itwill affect the persons
involved. ~'

°Impossihle Plays’

by CHARLES LEVINE

One of the incessant criticisms
leveled at the Pitt Theatre De-
partment is that it doesn’t pro-
duce enough plays by good mod-
ern playwrights. Of course, one
of the criticisms of contempor-
ary theater is that it doesn’t have
enough good playwrights.

It seems that a good many pro-
ducers _and directors would rath-
er remain uninvolved in the phil-
osophical debate (your basic ur-
ban cliche; and content them-
selves with staging those shows
which have shown themselves
time and again to be box-office
successes.

The purpose of this, especially
on college campuses, is not mere-‘
ly monetary. Many theater de-
partments (Pitt’s) have a primary
responsibility to their students, a
responsibility to _ teach conven-
tional dramatic techniques, the
“fundamentals” of theatre which
are displayed most overtly in the
so-called “realistic” plays.

We should thus expect a dearth
of avant— garde and unconven-
tional productions. So it is. How-
ever when one such endeavor is
undertaken, when the bonds are
temporarily shed_. we" should no-
tice it. Eric‘Forsythe‘s current
Studio Theatreproduction, Plays
Impossible‘ Plays, is one such
program. It should be noticed.

Plays Impossible Plays is a
montage of one-acts and sketches
by contemporary playwrights. It

Frat collects -
$600 for
charity drive

by MARSHA PEARLMAN .

Triangle Fraternity recently
joined efforts of Pittsburgh media
to raise money for Children’s Hos-
pital, collecting over $600 for the
Old Newsboy’s Fund.

Gale Shine, Triangle ‘President,
said “a fraternity has social re-
sponsibilities”. Therefore, 16
brothers stood on a Pittsburgh
street. corner for six hours Janu-
ary 29 soliciting money from
passersby.

One Triangle member said the
project reinforced the brothers’
faith in human nature.

“People were veryngenerous,”
Shine said. “They would go into
stores to get change if they
didn’t have any and would even
walk a block or so to donate if
they had gone to another corn-
er.” ,

Dale Lieb, director of the pro-
ject agreed. .

"The only ones that used the
excuse of ‘I gave at the office’

A were small childrenvjust running
around having a good time in

A town," he said.

' Next year, Triangle hopes to
involve other campus Greeks in
a project called "Ransom” in or-
der to raise more money for Chil-
dren’s Hospital.

A brother explained that one
Greek would be “kidnapped” and

members raised enough money

and physiological mobility. a
Chinese painting calling on the’
audience to connect lines and
complete images. _
The program consists of a rapid
succession» of eight works separat-
ed by a series of actor improvi-
sations and one intermission.

Through the direction of For-
sythe. assisted by Nicolette Gra-
matikos, the spectators are guid-
ed gently andlunknowingly into
the creation of a single discerni-
ble whole, as the action flows
smoothly toward a common cen-
ter. The idea that one is viewing
eight diverse works is lost.

Forsythe achieves superb tran-
sition from play to play through
an imaginative use, of split -stag-

ing and sets at both ends of the

studio, all action taking place
between them, and between two
banks of spectators.

The physical versatility of the
Studio is fully exploited as all
action takes place in, among, and
around the seats, with the rapid-
fire switch from set to set form-
ing an unstoppable flow.

Improvisations between sketch-
es are integrated well. Such fea-
tures as the “human machine”

created by all eight '._actors take *

on significance beyond their
role as bridges, augmenting a

concoction of bodies and nois-

es, movement and chatter that en-
gulfs the audience from begin-
ning to end.

No Time to Respond
As the "physicist" in Harold
Pinter's Applicant is blown off

-his chair by the "horn" busy

measuring his human reflexes,

the audience is frightened by
the speed. precision, and power
in these plays. We are not given

time to respond. We are in an art
gallery and are being pushed by

the curator. Our reactions congeat
as we step into the street.

A strain which lingers after
the eight plays is one of the col-
lision of sensitivity and brute
force, the creative will and col-
lective psychosis. Quiet conversa-
tion in a jet-propelled world.

Interaction in aisteel and iron

~ room. Guilt on an a-moral stage.

These are some thoughtsfthe

painting leaves much room for

other views. since we are pre-
sented with various degrees of
blacks and greys.

For instance, The Tridget of
Greva by Ring Lardner is an

amusing little strand of‘ inane

conversation between fishermen.

Karl Harshbarger and Rich John-

ston are perfect for the piece,
and as usual, Johnston's facial
contortions are half the show.
Due to the set and back to back
blocking, only half of the aud-
ience is confronted with his face.

-Pity goes to the other half.

_ Icarus’s Mother by Sam Shep-
ard somehow integrates a very un-
usual play with some often trite
dialogue. It deals with the men-
tal force groups can wield. and

the ease with which paranoia can

be infused in the universal mind.

Seemingly, the Cub basketball team had enough to worry
about in its game against Robert Morris Junior College last Sat-
urday night.

With 6-5 center Jonathan Marshall, classy Jesse Hutson at
guard. and the return of All-American_Ron Hightower, the Cubs
would have had to play a superb game without one of its top

. stars, Leroy Freeman (because of illness), to gain the 12th win

of the current sea son".

But, no. Tim Grgurich’s frosh had to put up with one more
force—Gus Krop. head basketball coach of the Colonials.

The venerable Krop is an intense cheerleader and, with his
overi500 wins as a head coach, he is one of the winningest active

coaches in the country. Also, with his wit, Gus has also been.

known to be quite humorous in -the city’s weekly basketball
luncheons. But, as far as regarding the talent of opposing play-
ers, respecting other coaches, and insulting the logic of some-
times illogical referees, Krop is, in my opinion, eh——-well bush.

For instance, take some of his ordinarily unquotable quotes »

made during the process of that game, in full earshot of three to
five hundred people. '

‘Midway into the first half,j_with the Cubs trailing 20-13,

“Krop told Kirk Bruce, "You stink"; Willis Cardot, "You stink

because people from Erie Prep can’t play basketball," and "You
-stink too ref,” to the officials; these being mild examples com-
pared to many others that will remain unquoted.

When Bruce drew his third personal foul of the half, Krop
accused him of having no guts because he wasn’t playing High-
tower as tight. Yet, Hutson and Bill Odem, who had three fouls
for RM, were sitting on the bench. All this occurred in the first
half. Kr.op didn’t sit on the bench in the second half. Perhaps he
couldn’t take his own blood-letting language.

It-was at one of those basketball luncheons earlier in the
year that Gus suggested thata statistic should be added for the

. .7 referees in the scoring’ books. Krop would like to call that stat, ’
‘If the Panthers are to sweep their three game home stand within

-jireferee takeovers.” If they shouldadd takeovers to coaches
instead, Gus Krop would be leading the league.

What effect; , if any, Kr0p’s inflammitory remarks had on i

the Cubs is unpredictable. The effecthis intimidation had on the
referees is. And whether or not Kropgave the referees “a piece
of my mind at halftime” as he vowed to do, it is pertinent to
note that the Colonials had 25 more ta‘keovers—oops check that-*
25 more foulshots than did the Cubs. Also pertinent is the fact

One of the referees, who will remain unnamed by choice,

- said: “What’s the use of calling a technical on him. Then,,the

fans, the players,‘ and Krop himself would "be more of a pain.”‘
With this thinking, what is to say the officials didn’t make calls

 just to appease the superfluous Krop?

‘ I think that it is unjustified that an athlete who puts in many
hours of hard work to achieve respectability on the court, should
be thwarted in such a brusque manner from the bench of a man
whose team uses‘ that same hard work to become one of the to
small college teams in the nation. . '

_ As the hal_f,ti.me buzzer sounded, Krop and Grgurichalmost
came to blows. Thankfully, cooler heads prevailed. ‘

After the game Grgurich told his players in the locker room I

that he never wanted them to act in a like manner.” ’ , -

“Yelling from the bench makes you look bush,” said Grgu-

rich. “After all, you are out there representing something and ‘
besides it doesn’t better the situation.” '

Perhaps Gus lost his head in the heat of battle. Perhaps he
didnlt really mean those nasty things he said. Perhaps he_ want-
ed to give his players an emotional lift. Whatever the perhaps, it
all boils down to what that “something” is that a team is out
there representing: ‘

More specifically, the scores
were Kent State 83.05. Pitt 60.30,

and Youngstown 52.95. Coach Gail .

DiCicco described the bout as "a
long, but exciting meet." and add-
ed, “There were 15 girls in each‘
event."

The showing against Kent State

Kent State outclassed Pitt by

taking all first, second, and third »

In contrast to Pitt’s perform-
ance against KSU was the fine

cise went to .Pitt’s DeMarino, with
Youngstown taking both second-

by MARK SIGMON

It was a very painful two-and-one-half years that Randy Payne
spent at the University of Pittsburgh. After discussing his problems
with both Coach Dave Adams and A.D. Casimir Myslinski. Payne quit
school last week.

Possibly the country's most sought after high school wrestler upon
graduation in 1969. Randy matriculated at Pitt. hoping to add to a
grap nucleus of Ralph Cindrich. Bob Kuhn. and Mark Payne (Randy’s
brother), in an attempt to restore the Panther mat glories of the 1950’s.

Despite a tremendously successful freshman season. culminated
by placing second at 126 pounds in the 1970 NCAA tourney at North-
western. Randy envisioned higher goals in 1971.

Refusing to live in the Towers another year, Randy spent one
hectic month convincing the Athletic Department to release him from
his room contract. Payne then suffered a recurrence of an old should-
er injury, which all but eliminated his wrestling practice time for a
month.

Randy withdrew from Pitt in January. 1971. allegedly for personal
reasons. Closer to the truth were his brother’s quitting thesquad and
Adams‘ inability to effectively communicate with either of the Payne
brothers.

Readmitted this past September. Randy felt he could handle one
more year at Pitt. both on the mat and with the Athletic Department.
But Harry Smeltz. Christmas vacation. and a bus ride forced Payne
to reconsider.

A varsity grappler for three seasons, senior Harry “Buddy” Smeltz
was expected to be the starting 142 pounder this year. Having received
a one-half tuition scholarship as a junior, “Buddy”thought he deserved
either more aid or at least a “work grant.”

Payne disillusioned by
U niversity- "H ill ’ tactics

Nevertheless. the Athletic Department decided Smeltz did not re-
quire financial aid. Consequently. Harry quit the team. Several matmen
resent that Adams, in their opinion. did not “go to bat enough“ for
Smeltz.

Payne was prohibited from competing against both Navy and Mary-
land in January for missing three days of practice in early January.
There is no doubt that Coach Adams cannot be faulted for administer-
ing this disciplinary action. What bothered Randy was a subsequent
team ban.

Grapplers Jim Fleming, Willie Saloky, and Lud Hanczar were sus-
pended from the squad for a week following an incident on the team
bus ride back from Temple two weeks ago. What irked Randv was the
fact that at least three more matmen, and maybe as many as five,
should also have been punished for the same misconduct but were not.

Many outstanding grapplers have come and gone through Pitt in
the past few years. Unfortunately. few of these mat performers have
reached their potential for the Old Gold and Blue.

Coaches Adams and Dick Slutzky are competent college mentors.
Yet both men have some trouble relating to their athletes. The squad’s
present 7-4 mark is more attributable to the togetherness of the wrest-
lers than from any_ coach-induced motivation for individual achieve-
ment.

Randy Payne intends to continue his college education. probably
at Oswego State in upper New York. Cautioned by numerous adults that
his actions constitute his running away and may subsequently “black-
ball" him in later life, Payne insisted that he had no choice.

Randy found Pittsburgh too suffocating. The communication break-
down proved insurmountable.
