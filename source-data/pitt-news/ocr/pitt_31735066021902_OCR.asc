Ecuador V.P. signs agreement

By Rae Ann Collette

Staff Writer

During his three-day visit to
Pittsburgh, the vice president of
Ecuador, Blasco Penaherrera, aid-
ed in and witnessed the signing
of an educational exchange
agreement between the Catholic
University, a_ prominent universi-
ty in Ecuador, and the University
of Pittsburgh. ’ g

The agreement allows for- an
exchange of technical staff and

students between the two univer-

sities; it also provides fora

cooperative effort to research

many areas ot importance and in-’

terest. ,

”This agreement will enable
each’ universtiy to increase its
educational level,” Penaherrera
said. ”We need to further de-
velop the quality of education at
the Catholic University.”

The former professor and

_ renowned politician said he is
_ very optimistic about the agree-'

ment. He said he hopes the
agreement will ”open the minds
of the students and of the faculty

to international relations, science .

and technology.”

”Pittsburgh realizes that it has
to open itself to more contacts as
its economic base changes,”
coordinator of the vice ‘presi-
dent's visit and professor at Pitt's
Graduate School of Public and In-
ternational Affairs, Hector Correa
said. ”This exchange agreement
between. universities in Pittsburgh
and Ecuador will helpiboth par-
ties improve education and

research — Pittsburgh's most im- g

tportant new industries.”
Correa said another goal he

hopes to reach as a result of the

    iesta!

 

 

The 28th annual Three
Rivers Arts Festival opened '
last Friday at noon _.for ar-

tival is over, art and music
lovers will have been treat-
ed to over 200 live per-
formmances, which

Medical
complex  
expansion
proposed

 Beth» Ernst "

For The Pitt News

Construction may begin as ear-

I ly as this fall on a proposed $230

million expansion of the Oakland

medical complex, which would '

include Eye and Ear and
Presbyterian-University hospitals,
as well as the Medical and Health

Care Division of_the University of"
Pittsburgh. The expansion, i_f ap- '

proved, is expected to be com-
pleted in 1990.

According to information

released by the University Health -

Science News Bureau to the City
Planning Commission, five areas
will be affected by the plan. A
15-story patient tower will be

built above Presby’s front wing in —
' order to ease overcrowding in in- ’

tensive care by bringing’ the num-

ber of beds to 636.—The transplant '

facility will also be expanded.
New labs and offices will be
housed within a proposed medi-
cal research building, which will
be built. atop Presby’s existing

seven-story_ garage. At the same" 

time, the Presbyterian Child

Guidance Building on DeSoto‘

Street will undergo a one-story

addition to facilitate diagnostic a

testing of patients of Presby and

Children's Eye and Ear Hospitals. ' in

A 10—story expansion of Falk Clin-
ic to house radiation facilities will

. be built over an existing 3—stor,y

garage‘. Finally, to provide ade-

quate parking in thearea, a new E.” 
330-space parking garage will be.‘  
constructed behind Trees Hall on '. ._
the site where‘ the tennis courts, , - 5

which will be relocated, now
stand. Shuttle service, will be
provided to the medical
complex. '

According to Bernard J." _ A

Kobosky, Pitt's Vice President for " '_

Public Affairs, ”Since the Univer- _.: 
sity of Pittsburgh is rapidly emerg-- ; .

ing as a nationallygrecognized" 
medical. center,’and because it is V

Contra heari

WASHINGTON — Fawn Hall
testified yesterday that she never
considered her shredding, alter-
ing and removing sensitive docu-
ments from Oliver North's files to
be part of a cover-up as the Iran-
Contra affair unraveled last fall. ”I
use the‘ word protect,” she said.
. In‘ occasionally contentious tes-
timony at the end of the first six-
week phase of Congress’ tele-
vised hearings, Hall atone point
said her activity was justified be-
cause ”sometimes you have to go

-above the written |aw.”

She swiftly retracted that, say-
ing a few moments later, ’’I don't
feel that.”

But she retracted none of her
support for North, describing him
as every secretary-’ s dream to
work for, praising his hard work
and patriotism and bluntly
challenging Maine Sen. William
Cohen's assertion that North does
not have a right to limited immu-
nity in the case. ’

Hall thus wrote the final chap-
ter in the initial phase of Con-
gress’ hearings, which recessed to
a tentative date of June. 22.

North and former National
Security Adviser John M. Poin-
dexter are expected to be called
to testify under limited immuni-
ty when the hearings resume later
this summer.

Reagan says summit
allies agree on gulf

VENICE — On the second day
of the annual International Eco-
nomic Conference in Venice
President Reagan announced the
allies had agreed that the free
flow of oil through the Persian
Gulf must be maintained.

However, the president's an-
nouncement did not mention any
allied commitment to using mili-
tary force in the region.

The United. States is slated to
start escorting Kuwaiti tankers -
which Iran has repeatedly at-
tacked —- under the American
flag, and Reagan administration
critics say the move will wind up
costing American lives.

The critics contend the United '

States should not shoulder the en-

WASHINGTON — Attorney-

MIAMI — Two Florida televi-'

The ad apparently involves a

tire shop employee who says if .

he does not sell 80,000 tires in a
month, he will die.

Roberts used a similar plea
earlier in the year to raise over $8
million. He said God would,
”call him home” if viewers did
not contribute the money.

The TV stations said the ad was
pulled because it was in bad
taste, but the owner of the tire

THE PlTT‘NEWS, Wednesday, June 10, 1987

By K.L. Quarrie

For The Pitt News

As Pitt students, we have
been made aware of the activi-
ties of the transplant center
that exists among various Oak-
land hospitals. However, there
exists a dedicated group close-
ly associated with these trans-
plant services that is unknown
to many at Pitt. This group is
the staff of Godspeed House.

‘ Godspeed House is a place
for transplant "candidates,
recipients and their families to
stay while undergoing treat-
ment in Pittsburgh. The house
is located five minutes from
Presbyterian-University
Hospital.

Kathleen Coyne, the found-
er of Godspeed, said she got
the idea for the house in 1982
when she ”saw cracks in the
plaster of the walls in the sys-
tem that was serving the trans-
plant patients.” This
inspiration has benefitted
many during trying times.
Since the founding of God-
speed House, over 3,000 have
used the housing. _

Coyne has housed over 50

, people in her own home to

_ -provide the recipients and
their families with the most
comfortable surroundings
possible. “

”My reward [for founding
Godspeed] is grace, their [the

House opens doors
to transplant patients

transplant recipients] reward is
health,” said Coyne.

Many improvements in
housing have already been
provided for transplant
recipients by Godspeed, but
more is being done. A special
water system is being installed
in the house because Pitts-
burgh water is not pure
enough for transplant patients
to drink. Godspeed is install-
ing a special system that,
through the use of ultraviolet
light, ”takes out the big and lit-
tle bugs in the water,” accord-
ing to Coyne.

Godspeed House is current-
ly operated by a staff of 22.
This staff consists of special
educators and groundskeepers
among others. There is a
registered nurse at the desk
and, only if requested, in the
patients’ rooms.

Aside from a comfortable

' place to stay, Godspeed pro-

vides food, laundry service
and transportation for
recipients and their families to
and from the hospitals.

The Godspeed House has
made receiving a transplant a
little more.comfortable for the
recipients and their families by
providing special care and a
place to call home tem-
porarily. T

Godspeed House is located
at 32 Pius Street in Bir-
mingham. A

Behavior modification focus
of weight control program

By Rae Ann Collette
Staff Writer

Special behavioral weight con-
trol programs specifically
designed for women, sponsored
by Healthsource, began June 4 in
order to help certain women es-
tablish healthier eating and exer-
cize habits.

”The 19 session programs,
which meet weekly, are basical-
ly learning processes for the
women,” said Sharin Porster,
R.N., behavioral health clinician
for the project.

”The women learn how to deal

with holiday and restaraunt situ-
ations and many other eating sit-
uations. Theylare retaught to be
less assertive around food," she
said.

Portser said the 90 minute
weekly sessions include time for
individual discussion and new
lecture information about nutri-
tion and physical activity. The
women are also taught special ex-
ercises to do at home during the
week.

The staff at Healthsource, a
joint venture of Magee—Womens
Hospital and Pitt School of Medi-
cine, department of psychiatry,

find that such programs prove to

be successful for women.
”We’re finding that the wom-

en who have been through the

programs are continuing to lose
weight,” Portser said.

Portser also said public
response to the program has been
encouraging. Few program open-
ings remain.

The behavioral weight control
program is under the direction of
Constance Dancu, M.A., a psy-
chologist and specialist in Be-
havior Therapy "at Western
Psychiatric Institute and Clinic.

sion is expected to have a posi-
tive affect on the university

University officials expect the

Tuition
increase
decision
awaited

Pitt has scheduled .a board of
trustees meeting on June 23 to
determine tuition for the
1987-88 academic year and is
still awaiting state funding

-legislation to be passed, ac--
cording to Dr. John Yeager,

vice president of management

and budget.

Yeager did not comment on
what the future cost of tuition
might be. ’’I’d rather not
speculate on that,” he said.

Yaeger expects state funding
legislation to be passed in late
June. Pitt government repre-
sentatives are currently at Har-
risburg lobbyingfor the 21.8
percent increase of state funds
that President Wesley Posvar

requested in the 1987-88
Budget Proposal. The proposal
stresses the need for an in-
crease in state funds in order
to stablize tuition costs.
Governor Casey supports only
a 5 percent increase.

Posvar said that tuition in-
creases are primarily due to

Hospital expansion
can help everyone

There was a time when the medical complex at- Pitt was one
of the finest in the country, if not the world. In recent years,
Pitt's status as such has been challenged by several other med-
ical centers. -. .

Last week, university officials put forth a proposal to the city
Planning Commission to guarantee our place at the top.

The proposal includes a $230 million addition to the exist-
ing medical complex: a I5-story extension to the top of one
of the wings of Presby, nine more floors atop one of the park-
inggarages, also at Presby; a 10—story extension to'Falk Clinic
and a slew of other construction projects in and around DeSo-
to and Lothrop streets. '

The construction will better equip the medical complex, but
equally important will be the 6,000 construction jobs created
during the three years it will take to finish thejob and the.1,000
permanent jobs created when construction is completed.

The proposal. hasn't been approved yet, but the university
is’ expecting to hear from the Planning Commission by June
16, l987.- I '

Approval .and actual construction of this plan is to be sup-
ported. When any sector of the university increases its status,
the status of the university rises with it. However, such addi-
tions would benefit not only Pitt but also the Pittsburgh com-
munity through improved medical care and the creation of new
employment opportunities.

Light thrown under

our political rocks

As Oliver North's political cavorting about becomes more
clear, and as his cronies emerge on the witness stand, we are

' struck by the blatant mismanagement and outright lying that

seem to have -become standard operating procedure for a
militarily-minded administration.

Relative unimportance

There are many things in this
world that bother me. Nothing
major or of any relative impor-
tance, just small, trivial matters,
such as the neon sculpture in the

"student union that comes very
‘close to reaching the ultimate

height of tackiness.

0 A few weeks ago'Pittsburgh
Press columnist Phil Musick
declared 1987 as ”The Year of
the Bimbo,” in reference to the
activities of Fawn «Hall, Donna
Rice and Jessica Hahn. I always
liked .Musick’s columns, but I
have to laugh thinking that a
column about none other than
Vanna White led to his dismissal
from the paper.

0 If Pitt does indeed install con-
dom vending machines, what
should be interesting is where
they are placed. The Towers lob-
by would be a possibility, but
there aren't any bathrooms there.

Obviously, condom machines
should be placed in a rather dis-
crete setting. The student union
bathrooms are a good possibility.

He has recommended that sever-
al cross sections of this nation be

tested for the nearest thing to a '

plague that this country has seen
for quite some time —— AIDS.
While I cannnot argue with the
testing of federal prisoners, it
seems the Reaganradministration
has overlooked something of
major importance. He at least
made an assumption that is a
clear example of the erroneous
thinking of our great leader. He
is, to say the least, far behind the
times. Perhaps one day when he
wakes from one of his White
House snoozes, he will find him-

More than just a musical romp  

Two Gentlemen of Verona debuts with a substantial dose of fun

.. TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA
Stephen Foster Memorial Theater

May 29-June 20
By Erica Helbling

Innovative. Hilarious. A musi-
cal romp. That is the Three Rivers

' Shakespeare Festival's Two Gen-

tlemen of Verona, now at the
Stephen Foster Memorial Theat-
er. Director W. Stephen Coleman

‘delivers a farcical dish on a plat-
4 ter of Victorian music.'With the
.. aid of
‘Christine Frezza, he seasons the

resident composer

Bard’s witty word play with-a

substantial dose .of Gilbert and

Sullivan style tunes.
Add witty characters, the in-
constancy of romantic love, the

betrayal of friendship, a man-
sized doglampooning every

quality attributed to canines and
you have delightful ’ enter-
tainment.

If the blending of periods 400
years apart sounds jarring, it is
not. Everything — the set, the
costumes and the lyrics —— flows

in unison.

The play opens with Valentine
and- Proteus, the two gentlemen

of Verona, vowing friendship to

each other as one departs for Mi-
lan. Valentine mocks his friend

for shunning travel in favor of.

love. ”Home-keeping youth have
ever homely wits,” he tells

Proteus. z

Julia is the magnet that fastens

 Proteus to‘ Verona — until his

father send him to serve the Duke
of Milan, that is.

' — One glance at Silvia, the duke’s

daughter, extracts self-puzzled
words from Proteus.

 

 

Two Gentlemen of Verona
receives Entertainment’s highest
rating: five Lola Fees.

”Even as one heat another ex-

pels .../So the remembrance of

my former love /ls by a newer ob-
ject quite forgotten.” ‘ A
Proteus tosses his love for Julia
and friendship for Valentine out
the window and schemes to win

-Silvia from Valentine.

_ The net is richly cast for many
of Shakespeare's theatrical
devices. An ample serving of
pungent soliloquies, two women

taking the roles of men, wise
clown-servants and an abrupt.

resolve of all conflict at the end.

This eighth TRSF season-
opener casts several new per-
formers. Jeffrey Plunkett as Pro-

ﬁteus brings a richlytmelodious

voice to his part. He has sung in
other productions, including
opera. He's working toward an
MFA in acting at Penn State
University, and Two Gentlemen
marks his first TRSF appearance.
His portrayal of the mecurial Pro-

'teus needs to be reined in a bit.

do it. _ -

seems out of balance with text

too long, a smile too forced. On,
the flip side, he could not have
rendered the lines regarding his
banishment more touchingly.
Kelly Maurer plays Julia, Pro-
teus’ initial love interest. Her
third appearance with TRSF,
Maurer has also performed in
severallocal productions and in
Japan. Maurer’s portrayal is at
once appropriately adolescent
and |evel-headed. ’
Loved by both gents, Silvia (Su-
san Liggett) returns the affections
of one and scorns the other. Lig-
gett’s performance leans heavily
toward being giddy and pubes-
cent. Her characterization was
not mature enough for a female

capable "of unswerving love.

Tammy Bouzos acted the
minor role‘ of Ursula,’ Silvia’s
|ady—in—waiting. She also under-
studied the role of Silvia. A vete-
ranvof TRSF, Bouzos studied in
Greece and holds an MFA in act-
ing from Pitt. -

is Nona Gerard playing Lucetta,
Julia's maid. However, playing

tor, Krummel struts across the

By Susan Washburn -

Assistant Entertainment Editor

If Grace Kelly can be married
on a Thursday, then so can Ros-
mary W Fazzari. In the current
production of the Pittsburgh Pub-
lic Theater, Princess Grace and
the Fazzaris, the two weddings
occur exactly the same day. Un-’
fortunately, the splendor of the
princess.’ wedding serves only to
remind the middle class‘ Fazzaris
of their own social immobility.

Written by Marc Alan Zagoren,
the play is of family hopes, fears
and frustrations that surface dur-
ing the expected chaos of a wed-
ding day. The premiere of
Zagoren’s work at the Public is
both insightful and. humorous.

Shakespeare's clowns often sur-
pass his main characters in wis-
dom and work wizardry.

Speed and Launce are no ex-

swiftness. All the while, Meyers
as Launce and Kenneth Borden as

dog waters the stage with tears.
The rope tying them together and

score the hysterical picture.

There will always be those peo-
ple who prefer Paul Weller to
The Cappaccino Kid, who wish
that this angry young(ish) Brit still
resided In The City ‘rather than at

.._Cafe Bleu.
But like it or not, The Style ‘

choice and The Jam- is‘ likely
never again to be.

cil and My Ever Changing Moods
were to be taken as any indica-

ed after dissolving The Jam, there

direction.

most well-done. The other three

- comedies lacked flair.

Martin garnered praise with the
release of All of Me. Though the
film was not a huge commercial
success, he got the critical ac-
claim that had been denied him
since the beginning of his career
in film. 

Following All of Me, Martin
played a small role in Little Shop
of Horrors and was one of the
Three Amigos. Both perfor-
mances gained critics’ approval.

With -the release of Roxanne, it
seems Steve Martin may be des-
tined for great things.

Martin not only starred in the
movie but he wrote the screen-
play and was the executive
producer.

Taken from the play Cyrano De
Bergerac, Roxanne is about

After considerable debate, The
Pitt News Entertainment staff has
given Roxanne a rating of four
Lola Fees (out of ascale of five).
Charlie (Steve Martin), a man
with an abnormally long nose
who has fallen in love with a
beautiful young lady named Rox-
anne (Daryl Hannah). She is in
love with Chris (Rick Rossovich),
a young hunk, and ironically asks
Charlie if he would set up a date
between Chris and herself.
Charlie attempts to help

Roxanne.

He writes letters expressing his
own true feelings about Roxanne
and then allows Chris to sign his

_I

name, thereby taking credit for
them.

Martin did a commendable job
of adapting the story. The tale
_. delightfully blends love and

comedy.

He set the tale in a town that
was seemingly mythological. The
name of the town was never
mentioned, nor was its location.
This was important in creating a
feeling of timelessness. Roxanne
isa movie that could have taken
place anywhere, at any time. ~

Rated PC, the film was heart-
warming to watch, a film that par-
ents can enjoy as much as their
children. Hollywood sometimes
forgets how to make movies like
this.

Steve Martin has matured ad-
mirably. He has written a charm-
ing, light comedy that is sure to

touch many a heart. -/

It is not only his writing that is
excellent but his acting as well.
He fills the role of Charlie with
humor and warmth. He is instant-
ly likeable. Charlie is the gentle-

- man most men would like to be. ~

He is eloquent, knowledgeable

and funny. Martin is wholly be- V

lievable in his portrayal.
Daryl Hannah is well—cast -— fi-
nally — in her role as Roxanne.

. Roxanne is both beautiful and in-

telligent, a character into which
Hannah fits well. Hannah and
Martin complement each other
well. Their timing was ‘nearly
flawless, as were both their per-
formances. ) _

Roxanne is the perfect summer-
time movie — pleasant, funny,

charming. It is sure to make you . ‘

smile.

.  
ways more fun for the fans than

those played during‘ the afternoon. It just seems more like real foot-
ball, doesn't it? Who can ever forget last year's night game against
Temple when the team was out on the field bathing in misery, and
the fans were in the stands showering in a torrential downpour?
Wasn't it fun? Didn't it inspire the diehards even more that they were
actually living out one of the advantages of a true American pastime?
(I, of course,» was keeping high and dry inthe pressbox, eating free
food, drinking free soda and conversing with my elders in this profes-
sion, but that's a different story.) Also, remember the Penn State from

Somehow one has to be hap-

- two years back? Sub-zero temperatures, snow, bagel throwing, fights

with Happy Valley people — I ask you, can anything be more fun?

The previous night games and accompanying portable luminaries
were enstated in order to facilitate television coverage of the games,

usually by either CBS or ESPN. So far only one‘ ofthegames, the Nov. ~

14 Penn State match-up, has been changed from the afternoon to the
evening so it can be televised, most likely by ESPN.

The other games now scheduled for night play are the Sept. 19
game against Temple (1 see hurricanes a blowin’) and the Oct. 3 game
versus Boston College. '

Now, for all of those out there who will complain such trivialities

- like, ”Oh no, now we _have less time to drink beer,” or, ”But now

I can't show off any of my new wardrobe to anyone because it will
be dark.” Think of how much fun those extendedtailgate parties will
be. Think of all the new ways you'll have to come up with to keep

' warm come November- Nothing is more romantic than your intend-

ed on one arm, a box of popcorn in the other, and a ”soda” at your

' . feet (Budweiser isn't permitted, you know, but there have been times

...)

And also, to those out there who feel themselves above sports and
get mad if they think one penny of their tuition is going to help the
athletic department, no need to worry. The cost of the new lights,
a reported $750,000, will be paid in approximately 10 years by the
revenues from increased ticket sales and the savings on the rentals
of the portable lights. Also, there will be no complications in their
installation because the wiring in the stadium was overhauled a few
years back in preparation for such an event.

‘ vitation to this summer's University Games competitions in July and

' instead plans on staying here at Pitt and concentrating on his studies.

Pitt first baseman Dave
Westwood, who just complet-
ed his junior year, was draft-

in the 11th round last week
but has decided to return to
Pitt for his senior season. .

The drafting came as no sur-
prise to head baseball coach
Bobby Lewis.

”Many major league teams
draft outstanding players in
their junior year of college,’’
said Lewis. ’’I was not sur-
prised because major league
teams have shown interest in
Dave since the beginning of
this season."-

. ”Dave had a difficult deci-
sion to make, though,” con-

ed by the San Francisco Giants -

'.tinued Lewis. ”He had to
decide whether it was more
-important to him to start in the
major leagues now or com-
plete his schooling.

”Dave is very concientious
about getting his degree. One
injury and you're out of athlet-
ics. A degree is more lasting.

- The Giant's offer would have

to have been very attractive in

order for Westwood to leave

now,” said Lewis.

Westwood, who is playing
in a summer baseball league
in Front Royal, Va., was una-
ble to be reached for

‘ comment.

McRae’s running two events at
the championships is probably
the reason he did not take first
place in the 100-meter race.

. ”Running doubles like that is
.quite a bit harder," said Vasvary.

”Lee is used to running the

‘100-meters completely fresh.”

”The guy who beat him in the

Sports Information still looking for director

By Christopher Sepesy
and Beth Froelich
The Pitt News

The recently vacated position
of Sports information Director for
the Pitt athletic department has
not been filled, however, things
are reportedly going well accord-
ing to assistant athletic director
W. Dean Billick.

”We don't have any one
specific person in mind yet, but
we have had a lot of applicants,”
said Billick. ”About 20 or so ap-
plications have come in already,
and we do expect more. But so
far what we have gotten is what

we expected.”

The position opened up three
weeks ago when the present
director, Jim O'Brien, was relo-
cated to the admissions depart-
ment. He will assume his new
position Aug. 1.

The athletic‘ department has
been advertising the position
,both locally and nationally in the
NCAA News. Billick said it is
from the national exposure that
the majority of the applications
have appeared or will appear.

”We’re talking about people
who have had either the same
type of job and experience or
have at least had a lot of exposure

to that same type of job,” said Bil-
lick. ”The majority of these peo-
ple probably will not be from the
Pittsburgh area, but will apply
from all around the country.”

Billick noted the main empha-
sis of the position is on market-
ing and promotional skills as well
as general sports information
itself.

”Above all, they have to
primarily be able to handle our
[Pitt's] most profitable sports —
football and basketball,” he said.
”But that doesn't rule out any of
the other sports. The person who
will fill the position will have to
be well-rounded and able to or-

ganize the information well in
and around the athletic
department."

It was rumored that O'Brien left
the position because of personal
differences with head football
coach Mike Gottfried, and that

Gottfried was now going to bring_

in his own choice for the posi-
tion, Doug Vance, who is cur-
rently at the University of Kansas.
Gottfried has worked with Vance
at both Kansas and the Universi-
ty of Cincinnati.

But Billick negates this.

”Neither Coach ‘Gottfried nor
anyone else has a say—so in the
matter,” he said.

Coach Gottfried maintains that
he has had no input on the deci-
sion thus far, but feels that Vance
would be a good choice.

“Thus far I have not been in-
volved in the SID recruiting
process at all,” said Gottfried.
”Right now I have no idea as to
whether or not I will have any in-
put in that decision. When the
time comes, and if they want my

input, I will sit down with them 

and tell them who I think would
be the best choice. I have worked
with Doug Vance two times be-
fore, and he's really good at what
he does. I have no idea whether
he has applied for the position or
not ” ’

Westwood

Continued from page 9

Westwood’s career statistics
look equally ‘impressive. He
has earned a career average of
.300 and has been at bat 357
times for the Panthers, which
qualifies hirﬁ as being named
”the most at bat.”

Of those 357 times at bat,
Westwood has scored 90 runs
and has 81 RBl’s.

Westwood is second in dou-
bles, third in triples, fourth in
home runs and fifth in hits.

”Dave has continued to im-
prove and get stronger every
year he is with us,” said Lewis.
’’I can only see him improving
further. We are glad that he is
staying, but, all along our main
concern was what was best for
Dave.”

Arena football may just be catching on

 

By Alan Robinson
AP Sports Writer

The Pittsburgh Gladiators have '

sold 3,000 season tickets for their
inaugural Arena Football season,
even though the team still doesn't
have a roster 10 days before its
opener, and the sport itself is an
unknown quantity.

”The original plan was we
wouldn't even try to sellseason
tickets this year, but we had so
many fans calling for,them, we
put them on sale,” Mark Gorscak,
the Gladiators’ newly appointed
team manager, said Tuesday. ”So

obviously, we're happy with the
response.”

Pittsburgh is one of four cities
that will field teams for the indoor
professional league's first season,
which opens June 19 when the
Gladiators play the Washington
Commandos at the Civic Arena.

Arena Football hopes to com-
bine the physical nature of foot-
ball with the speed of hockeyand
the unpredictability of pinball.
The field (50 yards long, 56 feet
wide) is approximately half the
sizeof a standard field, and its
compactness should result in a
reliance on short passes rather

than long bombs and quick trap
running plays instead of sweeps.

Each team will field eight rather
than 11 players, and all players,
except for quarterbacks and kick-
ers, must play both ways.

There are other differences be-
tweentradjtional football and the
new indoor variety. Drop kicks
rather than the conventional
placement kicks will be en-
couraged andwill count for ad-
ditional points: two points instead
of one on PATs and four instead
of three on field goals.‘

And, in the most radical depar-
ture from standard football, large

screens will be mounted behind
the goal posts. Balls ricocheting
off the screens an unsuccessful
field goal attempts and passes
will be in play, hence the sport's
resemblance to pinball.

The league invited 120 players
to its preseason camp in Whea-
ton, 111., last month. Seventy-
seven remained as of Tuesday
and 64 of those will be assigned
to teams — 16 to a squad —— after
an exhibition game Friday. The
other 13 will be kept in a reserve
pool in case of injuries.

According to team coach and
league player ‘personnel director
