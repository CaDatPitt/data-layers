PhiEp Leader Asks Opening
Of F rats to All‘ Races, Creeds

Annational fraternity leader told a student audience Mon-
day that fraternities should “open the doors” to all religions

’ and races.

Milton K; Susman, national president of Phi Epsilon Pi
told a group of approximately 70 students, assembled at one

of the _ ﬁrst Brotherhood Weeké
S meetings here, that “these ‘false l

standards" of race, religion, and
nationality ‘must go.’ ”
The, speaker, whose own frater-

admitted during the question per-

element into a fraternity, former-

Fear Builds Walls

The national and religious
“walls” around social groups, he

said, are born of the fear charac-
teristic of the present age.

Fraternities, which the speaker
deﬁned as a happy addition to a
college career, “have always at-
tempted to be ‘exclusive,’ ” a sit-
uation not, in itself evil, Mr. Sus-
man said;

It is when the exclusiveness is
based, not on the personal. quali-
ﬁcations of the applicants to mem-
bership‘, but on the ‘false’ stand-
ards of racial and religious back-
ground that it becomes evil.

Repeal No Cure-all

He emphasized, however, -that
the mere repealing of an exclusion
clause will not insure “brother-
hood” on the part of a fraternity.
Brotherhood, he said, is an ideal
that cannot be -reached in one
stroke.

Nevertheless, fraternities should
“open the doors” by removing the
discriminatory clauses. Mr. Sus-
man concluded “that organization
(which discriminates on any
grounds but personal qualiﬁca-
tions) can never be a’ contributing
factor to peace and freedom.”

, Found: A solution to that old old problem, how to
combine activities, jobs, sleep, and high QPA’s. Just don’t

l_ sleep on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

iAt least, that’s how English major Bill Heyman solves

the problem. Besides carrying 15¢-

credits, Heyman handles .a stag-
gering load of extra-curricular ac-
tivities.

During the 1950 season, he was
in charge of publicity for the foot-
ball team. This year, part of his
extremely spare 9 “spare” time ‘is
spent in editing the Alumni News
Review, although Heyman himself
is an undergraduate student.

House Work Doesn’t Faze Him

Bill is quite modest about his ac-
tivities, however. Even doing lrlis
own’ housework doesn’t faze him.
That is, all except for one thing.
“I don’t like washing dishes,” says
the busy man. ,

"Pitt women might sit up and
take notice, however, of Heyman’s
culinary accomplishments. H e
claims he’s a marvelous cook. His
“One that doesn’t
require many pots and pans!”

A former" resident of Rochester,
Pa., he still serves as social sec-
retary of a dramatic guild which

Naturally, since all of these ac-

Discrimination Issue Prompts  

Chicago Frat’s Vote To Dishand

CHICAGO, Feb. 18 (ACP)—At
the University of Chicago, the
members of Sigma Chi fraternity
have voted unoiﬁcially to disband.

The chapter was~put on proba-
tion by. its national oﬁicers last
fall for failing to submit its pledge

, list, which contained the name of

a Jewish student, to an alumni
group.

Alumni of the fraternity had

4 threatened to sell the chapter

house if the student was pledged.
The chapter was backed in its
action by the student government

' and the’ Inter-Fraternity council.

And from the administration’s
st_and,point, Robert, Strozier, dean
of students, declared, “The Uni-

A report printed in The Circle,

' out clearly what has happened to

States. . ‘ J "

The report shows a drop of 11.4

a loss of 14.5 per cent in the en-
rollments of th e independent
teacher’s colleges. ‘ V

cent in their freshmen classes
after a “toboggan drop” last year.

Dr. Raymond Walters, president
of the University of Cincinnati and
compiler of the report, attributes
the drop last year to “erroneous
statements . . . that the engineer-
ing ﬁeld was overcrowded.”

Lack of Teachers “Alarming’

The report ﬁnds the decrease in

teacher*s college enrollments the
“most alarming.”

Dr. Walters writes that worst of
all, “ . . in View of the need for
teachers  . is the calamitous de-
cline in young men and women en-
tering education courses.”

Among the freshmen, more men
than women have ‘decided to stay
away from college. Thq 6.4 per
cent drop in freshmen ﬁgures hides
the fact that there are 8.2 per cent
fewer men and only 3.5 per cent

. fewer women.

Less Children Cause

Dr. Walters suggests these rea-
sons for the big ‘freshman de-
-crease:

1. Fewer children in the middle-
income group. '

2. Better outside jobs, at better
pay. .

. _ Each year the intellectiial giants who run our
Spring Festival concoct some noveltheme for the
festivities to center around. If you read page
one, you are privy to the hitherto top secret in-
formationithatithis May We will be centering around
a PITT-y the ROMANS theme. Last year we cen-
f_tered around a wild and wooly Western theme.

The _Western theme had some
obvious advantages. You could
quit shaving andiinstead of be-
ing’ ostracized as a social misﬁt
and proabable failure in the
business world, you were hailed
as a regular Joe. You could wear
jeiansi and feel well dressed; you
could chew and spit and scratch
and everyone interpreted your
fdeyﬁance of the niceties of life
Vascogoperatidn. “ .
A The boys with their Western beards even felt
__a' little virile and, occasionally, noble like the
hero of the ‘Virginian. The girls didn’t seem to
‘mind the -growth; they said it tickled.

But this Roman theme offers some obvious dif-
iﬁculties. Do the sponsors propose that we f go
.,around in togas? Should we recline in class rooms?
Are we to sip wine instead of Tuck Shop coffee‘?
i.(Here’s a way tosave money.)

What are the girls going to think of a chap who
it fancies? ‘himself an Ovid? Or rather what will
their _“mothers think of young men fancying them-
.‘selves:Ovids, young men who speak in couplets
and turn them to the ruin of innocent American
° imaidenhood? ‘ ”

 

 

 

in order to really go Roman we’ll have to burn
< down something just like in “Quo _Vadis.” Accord-
ing to authorities the Cathedral is ﬁreproof. Maybe
‘ some fraternity or sororitywill contribute a house
in for the conﬂagration? Naturally, the fraternity
fpresident will be permitted to play the harp while
' the house goes up.

But in a more signiﬁcant area, how are we to
justify our Christian culture with the paganism
; of the Romans? Obviously there is a conﬂict
. which must be resolved. Al Payne, who heads the

time. If this is so, our ,Religion—in-Life Week spon-

cient Rome. ‘

Here, where Student Congress

The Reflector ,

The theft of a transparent
clothing bust full of cigarettes
set the Mississippi State College
campus buzzing recently.

The bust, like" those used in
store window displays, was part-
ly ﬁlled with 316 cigarettes. It
stood just inside the door of the
College Grill, and was being used
as part of a guessing contest and
publicity scheme.

At Allegheny College, concrete T

action against cheating» by stu-

Penalties ranged from expul-

Three, ‘students were expelled,"

been tried ﬁrst on the charge -of
illegal entry into'Bently Hall on
three occasions, theft of a ﬁnal.

the study of and memorization of

Letters To The Editor

Discriminalion in Minds

Editor ,
The Pitt News

The Student Congress cam-
paign to discover discrimination
at Pitt is highly amusing. Where
do you ﬁnd discrimination? In a
building or on a poster? Or do
you ﬁnd it in the hearts of men
and women? One look in a mir-

ror should be enough to tell ;any’-“ ,

Is it a moral phenomena or a

Those who denounce discrimina-

molehills. What is signiﬁcant
about a practice which is accept-

ed and has deﬁnite social sanc-
tions? All this whoop-de-do over

such an insigniﬁcant issue seems

    

unwarranted to me.

New-Type Hale

This is Brotherhood Week, and as good a time
as any to think about why ‘we are observing‘ one.
As if the traditional list of reasons given for man’:
inhumanity to himself were not already long
enough, the modern age has added to it. A

The high degree of specialization required of
individuals in an industrial society fosters intol-

  

tural differences, racial antagon-
isms, or anything else.
The pattern of our society is

groups‘ of specialists having con-
ﬂicting interests and activities
which create irritation and an-
tagonism at every, turn.

A lot of the irritations occur
in contacts in which.one or both ' =
ofthe parties are acting in their role as function-

 

aries (specialists.) Think of your relationship with

a streetcar conductor, for example.

If you happen to be in a_ hurry to get-where?

you’re going, and the car you are on happens to be
ahead of schedule and is forced to‘ run slowly, the
only result possible is a lot of bad feeling toward
the conductor on your part. '

Furious Frustration

If there happens to -be some sort of a crisis to
which you are travelling, and you are in a really
desperate hurry, this feeling can reach an astound-
ingly high emotional pitch.

The worst part of it is that you can do nothing
about it. The conductor is perfectly justiﬁed in go-
ing slowly if he’s ahead of schedule-—it is part of
his job--and if it happens to be an inconvenience
to you, that’s just tough.

There is no reasonable or logical way out of the _

impasse. All you can do is sit there and swear at
him under your breath. ’ so

Unfortunately, after enough of these experiences
it’s inevitable that you become, conditioned? to dis-
like streetcar conductors as a class in the same way
that southern whites become conditioned to hate
Negroes as a class. Though they may diﬁer in in-
tensity, the two attitudes, in being unreasonable
and intolerant, are the same.

And it is signiﬁcant in this case that this un-
botherly feeling -is directed _at the streetcar oper-
ator/not because he is a Negro, or a Jew, or a capi-
talist or Communist, or a Catholic or Methodist, or
a Republican or Democrat, but simply because he‘
is a streetcar conductor, nothing else.

An incident like this is small enough in itself;

multiply it by several“ million each day and "you H

have a total ofzminor conﬂicts that weigh down

the scale on the side of intolerance asvsurely as

the race problem in the South.

A Book Review

On Loyalty . r
CLARK $UTTON

Books" that are a year old are seldom good
subjects for reviews, particularly in newspapers.

But Alan Barth’s “The Loyalty of Free Men” is
‘ an exception to that rule for two reasons. First,_

because it has just ‘been re-printed by Pocket Books
Inc. and can be purchasedfor only 35 cents, Sec-
ond, it is a book that cannot‘ be put into any time
slot. It would have been timely when we fought

for our independence and it will be timely as long

as men continue to ﬁght for freedom. ,
The ﬁrst of the two things Mr. Barth does in
his book is to give us an over—all account of what
has been happening to our freedom. He has taken
little incidents that seemed trivial and unimportant

when they happened and put them together. The 
resulting picture is completely frightening because _

it shows how men lose their freedom when it is
taken away piecemeal. 1
The Sordid Facts

In this book the facts are presented and they
are sordid facts, to say the least. The Hiss-
Chambers affair, the Lattimore case, the California

‘Loyalty Oaths and many others. Facts, substan-

tiated, noted and indexed for those who doubt the,
souices. ,

Mr. Barth gives arguments for the preservation
of freedom of thought and speech and gives them
determinedly and with persuasive reasoning. He
does not do it in the language of Patrick Henry

and the other great patriots» of the past, but in the,

language of our time and with familiar examples
and present day facts.

Best of all. Mr. Barth’s book is no name call-
ing, slanderous, irabblerousing piece of work. It
is an objective, intelligent book written with a
deep insight and a great deal of honesty.

For those who have been concerned over the
loss” of many of our freedoms, this book conﬁrms

you fears and shows you how this freedom was

lost.

For those who have shown no cone:-1*n’ on the.

Lahar B

ack as Dawson

 

   

Harold “Toad” Lahar, new-
lay-appointed line coach under
Head Coach Red'Dawson, assumes
here a similar post to the one he
held with Dawson at Buffalo in
1947. '

Then, as a player-captain for

the professional Bills, Lahar was »

also an assistant coach for two

years. The arrangement was one ‘

of -the strangest in football.

At present the ex—West Virginia
line coach is a house guest of the
Dawsons in Aspinwall until he lo-
.cates suitable living quarters.

Backfield Coach in Doubt

The other coaching positions
have not been announced as yet
by Dawson but it is expected that

all of last year’s grid aides will be

maintained in some coaching ca-
pacity.

Among the vacant jobs is that
of backﬁeld coach. Athletic Di-
rector Tom Hamilton stated last
week that he had received appli-
cations for the post but refused to
reveal them.

Lahar, 32, a native of Oklahoma,
played guard and tackle at the
University of Oklahoma under
Tom Stidham. Before entering the
Navy he played two seasons for
George Halas’ Chicago Bears.

' Coached at Arkansas

He resumed his prolgrid career
after the war with the Bills but
returned to college football as line
coach at Arkansas in 1949.

Lahar’s work so -impressed WVU
Head Coach ArtLewis, who was
then at Missiscsippi State, that he

was alogical choice to handle the in

same assignment under Lewis.
The switch to Pitt ends a two-
. year hitch with the Mountaineers.
Lahar is married but has no fam-
ily.

his Carnegie Tech passers-—

holds a decided edge over Dr. H. C. Carlson’s troop since
he took over the coaching duties of the Plaid. '

In ﬁve Pitt-Tech mixers Cratsley’s strategy has proved
superior in four. And it must be that stratagem_ or ﬁght or
some other kind of ﬁne Scotch spirits because Pitt has been
the favorite to cop in each game played.

Kuzma Wins

Mile at MSC

Three Panthers placed in the
Michigan State Relays which drew
a record ﬁeld of 428 entries last
Saturday at East Lansing.

Frank Kuzma, Pitt’s outstand-
ing track ace, took ﬁrst place in
the mile in which 15 others com-
peted, o1;1t:listancing Ohio State
star Len Truex, whom he had

beaten earlier this year at ‘the.

Field House. Kuzma won easily
with a 4:25:2 mark, to better the
Field House ‘time by 3.8 seconds.’

Wally Monahan grabbed fourth
in the high hurdles for the Blue
and Gold for another individual
win.

In the mile relay event, the Pan-
ther team ﬁnished fourth in a ﬁeld
of nine with a 3.23 time in two
heats. ‘

The indoor affair drew repre-
sentatiyes from 2-5 of the nations
top college and university track
teams from all sectionsexcept the
Paciﬁc Coast. ‘

Field ouse Attendance Drops ‘

Tonight’s game with Tech marks
‘the end of the ﬁrst year of Field
House activities on a collegiate
basis. p I
The attendance atvthe basketball
and wrestling contests have fallen
short of pre-season hopes while
the lone track meet, which drew

approximately 1000, bettered the ‘

hopes of Pitt’s athletic body.

Wrestling coach Rex Peery com-
ments on‘ the wrestling attendance
by saying, “They say that ‘a win-
ning team draws the fans, and we
have an 8-2 record». But‘ there

""*weren’t more than 25 students

2 “ Below Pre-Season Hopes

there last "Saturday. At Penn. State

4500 were students.”

Although the basketball team
recordeda much better attendance
ﬁgure than last year’s squad,
_ mainly because of more home en-
gagements, the total was far less
than expected.

Only two games, the opener
with Columbia, and the neighbor-
hood rivalry with West Virginia,
were played to capacity crowds.

The Yale game on New Year’s
Eve drew the least number of fans
-780.

Pitt’s Frosh—JV hoopsters, who
(are doing more than their share
in upholding the basketball for-
tunes of Skyscraper  will play
host to Mike Theodore’s Tech JV
quintet at 6:45 Wednesday.

The Panther ﬁve with Dodo
tCanterna at the helm copped a
54-45 decision at the Tartan gym

on January 16. Since that en.-

counter, Edgar Jones has taken
over the coaching reins from the
ailing Canterna, and Bob Bingham
second highest point-getter for
Pitt has been dropped from school.
Chet Palesko, who accounted for

I 21 points against the Plaid in their

last contest has since been promot-
ed to the varsity.

On the brighter side of the ledg-
er, however, McKeesport High’s
Wayne Smith has taken up the
slack and moved to fourth posi-
tion in the array of JV dribblers.

Jones’ quintet won its tenth de-
cision in twelve starts on Satur-
day by shading the .Westminster

JV’s;54-52. Joe Resutek paced the,

Johnstown‘ Catholic Ace’s season’s

Prep for ‘Mounties

By DON SCHURMAN

After notching win No. 8 at the Field House last Satur-
day, Rex Peery’s wrestlers are now preparing for the tail-

end of their grueling 11-meet
weekend.

The Mountaineers should hardly
be more than a light workout for
the Pitts, however, after last Sat-
thrilling 15-11 battle
against Franklin and Marshall.

Only a sweep of the light-
weight divisions saved the grapp-
ler’s ﬁve-meet winning ‘streak, as
the Diplomats scored all their
points in the top three weight
classes——-Pitt’s usual sore spot.

Pitt Won Last Year

“Superior conditioning in the
lighter divisions gave us the edge,”
analyzes Peery, “but we can use
more work in the heavier weights.”

On the other hand, Pitt’s season
ﬁnale at Morgantown this Satur-
day should not be quite as depend-
ent on the conditioning factor.
Last year, a much weaker Panther
squad whipped the Mountaineers,
18-11.

Mountaineer Coach Steve Har-
rick calls his current team “just

Days,” referring to the l920’s and

Wrestling Coach Rex Peery is ﬁnding Pittsburgh taking
to collegiate wrestling like a child to castor oil.
The sport which madeitelevision hasn’t produced any-'

7 thing but empty seats at the Field House this winter although

the Panthers have a respectable record of eight wins, two

losses.

Last Saturday’s attendance of
294 was an example of the fol-
lowing of Pitt’s wrestling team.

This p a p e r
has been giving
Peery’s charges ‘

licity s o t h e

of knowledge of

Itiboils down
to the fact that

probably never will be changed.

be changed in order for Shapiro to

SC, knowing that Shapiro was

left slightly humbled after the lo-
cals showed their stuff. '

One glance at the Pitt record
books tells the story of this year's
success.

Records Made To Be Broken_

All-time marks in seven of the
nine racing events are held by‘
members of the present squad,
which speaks well for the individ-
uals themselves. 1

Free stylers Jim Zentgraf and
Bill Corr have appeared in three
different record events, Don Fan-
ning and Ronnie Gainsford have
appeared in two, with Gerald
Weiss and Harry Piwowarski per-
forming the free styleirelay record.

Add to this hard work and team

balance and the result could be the

best squad Coach Grady has put
out since he took over in 1939.

To Decide
First Spot

By STEVE PASSAMANECK

The outstanding attraction
of the l952—intramural basket-
ball season will be played to-
morrow night when the unbeaten
Phi Gams (12-0) meet the PiKAs
(11-1) at 7:30 on the Stadium pa-
vilionp

year’s IF race.
PIKA’s, whose only defeat was by
three points to the Phi Delts, would
throw the interfraternity compe-
tition into a tie. But a victory for
the Phi Gams would ensure them
of a playoff berth in the fraternity
race.

On paper the Pi_KA’s have the
most impressive team personnel.
All of the starting ﬁve are former
high school stars. In addition, for-
ward Don Milletary and 6-4 re-
bounder Wade Jones are former
Pitt frosh performers. _

Joe Berger of Allderdice, John
Connimikes of Stanton Prep, Va.,
and Dick Stanko of Huntington
make up the remainder of the ﬁrst
ﬁve. . '

‘IM SPORTS DEADLINE

Entries for intramural
wrestling, handball, badmin-
ton, ping pong, and squash
must be turned in to the IM
oﬂice no later than today. In-
terested students should call
Leo Bemis at Extension 671.

Phi Gams will counter with two
aces of their own. Billy Reynolds
-and Hal Mitchell are the two boys
that the Fijis hope will carry them
to their 16th”/consecutive victory.

Varsity quarterback Blair Kra-
mer led the team in scbring until
he quit the fraternity a week ago.

Other starting members for to-
morrow night’s tussle‘ are Glenn
Dillon, Joe Porter, and Bill Me-
Kay.

Not Wise Enough

Pitt’s Y’s guys were a lot wiser
after their tangle with the Physi-
cal Education Majors’ quintet was
over.

at their command to swamp Pitt
YMCA, ’ 47-37, on the Stadium
ﬂoor. Every cage device from the
zone defense to the old art of
cherry-picking was demonstrated
by the musclemen. Ruddy Musilin
led the attack on the Y’s hoop
with 22 points while Bill Schanz
‘took second scoring honors home
to the YMCA sinking 17 points.

Rushing ‘around the court like
ﬁre horses, the phys eds snuffed
out the early YMCA blaze with
spectacular p a s s‘ interceptions.

its infancy it ‘has been here only
two years it has a newly—estab—

PCW, Duquesne, and Tech. Ten
foreign -countries are also rep-
resented, Germany, India, Hol-
'7land,. France,‘ and England, to
name only a few. ’ _,

pork dish, and fresh fruit fol-
lowed by much cold water.

The next event on the social
calendar is a square dance Feb-
ruary 29. Most likely the.Leap
Year theme will be carried out.

The group is sponsored by the
First Baptist Church and holds
its meeting and social affairs at
the church headquarters, Belle-
ﬁeld and Bayard streets.

0 The only requirement for,
.membership is attendance at club
functions.

Pitkin Club-

The Pitkin Club has the dis-
tinction of being the oldest re-
ligious organiation on campus._
Hugh Thomson Kerr, a Univer-
sity trustee, founded the group
thirty-nine years ago as a ‘ire,-
ligious group for Pitt ,_and:P.‘CW
students. - .

With an active membership of
65 students, the group thisyear
meets every Wednesday evening
at 5:30 p.m. in the Shadyside
Church fora dinner meeting and
a discussion of both worldly an
spiritual affairs. , '

Recently, the honor system
with itslpros and cons, its effect
and obligation on students, was
the topic for the meeting.’

Socials are also an important
matter with this group. Since
their purpose is to make religion
live in the life of the University
’ student, the group has frequent
dances, parties, and hayrides to
bring students together socially
under church sponsorship. _

Anyone interested in joining
, may do so by attending the
Weekly meetings. There are no
dues, but student offerings keep
the bills paid. '

During Religion-In-Life Week,
oneof the ‘speakers will be the
guest of the Pitkins at their
Wednesday night supper.

NEA Offers Some Academic Cliches

   
 

these suggestions some appropriate remarks for academic
occasions. The following, from the NEA Journal, are:
, When you are given an objective test: ‘ ‘It doesn’t let you

express yourself.”

When you are given an essay
test: “It’s so vague. You don’t
know what’s expected.”

For Minor Tests
' When you are given‘ many minor
tests: “Why not have a few big
ones? This keeps you on edge all
the time.” ’,

When you are given no tests:
“It’s not fair. How can he possibly
judge what we know?”

When every part of the subject
is taken up in class: “Oh, he just
follows the book.” A

When you are asked to study a‘

part of the subject by yourself:
“Why, he never even discussed it!”
When the course is in lecture
form: “We never get a. chance to
say anything.” ‘
When the course consists of in-

formal , lectures and discussion:
“He just sits there. Who wants to
hear the students? They don’t
know how to teach the course.”

When detailed material is pre-
sented: “What’s the use? You for-
get it all after the exam anyway.”

When general principles are pre-
sented: “What did we learn? We
knew all that before we took the
course.”

D escended from a long line of distinguished
researchers, this studious scholar has burned too many

4 gallons oi midnight oil to gloss over a subject lightly.
Especially such an important item as cigarette mildness.
He burrowed into the matter with his usual resolution
and concluded that a “quick pu ” or a “fast sniﬁ”
doesn’t offer much evidence. Millions of smokers agree
there’s but one trhc test of cigarette mildness.»

It’s the sensible test...thc 30-Day Camel Mildness
Test, which simply asks you to ‘try Camels as your

London Print Collection
In Fine Arts Display

Impressive, picturesque prints:

showing London in the latter part
of the 19th century are now on
display in the fine, arts department.
Appropriately entitled, “London
As It Is,” this exhibit of 26 lith-
ographs contains picturesque views
of old London, showing many fam-
ous landmarks of the city.
Drawn and lithographed by
Thomas Shotter Boys, these prints
“reveal the friendliness and charm
of the people and the architecture
of the city.” The prints have been
run off in color and retouched
with water colors. R‘
‘ They record the views of Lon-
don with its famous ‘city churches,
its historical landmarks such as
the Tower, Westminster Abbey,
and St. James Palace. Shotter
Boys’ portrayal of London could
well be used even today to de-
scribe and point out famous his-

‘toric landmarks which are still
_ “drawing cards” for visitors.

These lithographs have been
given to the ﬁne arts department
by Mr. Frederic Schaefer. This ex-
hibition will continue through
February 20. The seventh iﬂoor
gallery is open from 9-5 weekdays,

‘ and from 9-12 Saturdays.

Seniors Meet

To Pick Queen

(Continued from Page 1)
in the Commons Room on June 9
by the senior class.
Miss Rush told seniors at the
meeting that a beauty contest

comparable to May Queen contests
was held annually at Pitt prior to
1926. That year, she explained, in
response to requests from the‘
women themselves, Dean of Wom-
en Thyrsa W. Amos, Miss Rush’s
predecessor, instituted, the formal
coronation.
Based on High Ideals
Since that time, Miss Rush said,

the selection of a Senior Queen
has come to be based on the high-
est ideals, and today “the woman
who is selected should have some
of the humility and graciousness
of a present-day Queen.”

1 2th Floor Chair Open

Aplications for S the Twelfth
Floor Committee chairmanship are
available in the twelfth ﬂoor dean
of women’s office until Friday,
