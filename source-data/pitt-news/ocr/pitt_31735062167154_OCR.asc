A HARRISBURG, March 13--State lead-
ers here disclosed Wednesday that no long
range solution has been found for the
budgetary dilemma plaguing state related
universities.

The whole situation, in fact, has been
aggravated by the recent teacher strike.
There are, however, some ideas for an
ultimate solution for the problem. But no
active steps have been taken to remedy
the situation.

Governor Raymond P. Shafer believes
the whole fiscal solution lies in a state
income tax. Gov. Shafer stated that he
proposed an income tax in June, 1967. But
“nothing was done.”,

“At the present time, the needs are
such that we need an income tax." said
Shafer.

When asked about the possibility of a
budget cut of 3.2 million for the Univers-

 

ate Leaders Ss

  

GOV. RAYMOND 
Stresses Need for Income Tax

 

 

 

ity, Gov. Shafer stated this will not be the
case.

“A continuing appropriation is desig-
nated for Pitt. With this continuing ap-
proach, a certain amount of money is ap-

propriated over a period of time,” accord- .

ing to the Governor.
He stated that there will be no budget

cut for the University. However, some of
the appropriations that are not utilized

can be redirected to the areas that he
said .

Senator Ernest P. Kline offered an-
other solution by calling for an Education
Resources Development Authority “to at-
tack the fundamental financial problems
of all phases of education in Pennsyl-
Vania."

The object of the Authority would be
“to borrow up to 500 million dollars over
the next three years during which time the

Need of Income Tax

Legislature could examine all aspects of
its fiscal dilemma in order to produce a
c00I‘dinat€d Program of revenue-raising
measures to perpetuate the development
of education.”

Sen. Kline feels that it is necessary to
“provide additional funds for the opera-
tional and capital expenditures at the
State colleges and State-related universit-
ies.

State Superintendent of Public Instruc-

, tion Dr. David H. Kurtzman also stressed

the need for an income tax to resolve
revenue dilemma. Dr. Kurtzman felt that
an income tax proposal would not pass
the legislature because of the burdens of
an election year. He also stated that Sen. '
Kline‘s proposal “was not really a solu.
tion. Dr. Kurtzman heads the state com-
mittee that is looking into long range so.
lutions to the financial situation.

Nelson Rockefeller Sets Date

For Candidacy Decision

by DAVID BAER

First a State police car, then the city and county po-
lice all came roaring off the Fort Pitt Bridge, and into the
Pittsburgh Hilton driveway. Close behind the police, there
was a large black Cadillac, and behind the Cadillac there
came a bus carrying the forty press men that follow Gov-

ernor Nelso.-n Rockefeller wherever he goes.

As Governor Rockefeller stepped out of his car, he was greeted
by “the Allegheny County for Rockefeller” committee. This organ-
ization consisted of 25 screaming Chatham girls, and 15 well dressed
University Law Students. They held a large sign proclaiming, “You
have our heart, you’ll have to fight for the rest.” As Rockefeller got
out of his car the demonstrators were yelling, “We want Rocky.”

The Governor went over the the demonstrators immediately,
thanking them all profusely, shaking hands all around, and even kiss-
ing several of the girls. Then the Governor headed into the ballroom
of the Hilton to accept an award from the convention on urban trans-
portation for “outstanding contribution to the progress and advance-
ment of improved urban transportation.” He thanked the convention,
and promised that New York would continue to be a leader in urban
transportation. With this he stepped down from the podium, while
the better than 1,000 people gave him a standing ovation.

fuller takes a moment alone to

A Litchfield Memorial Service

Set For Sunday, 3:00 RM.

The University of Pittsburgh
will hold a memorial service for
former chancellor Edward H.
Litchfield and his family Sun-
day, March 17, in Heinz Me-
morial Chapel at 3 p.m.

Dr. Litchfield, Pi.tt’s 12th

" chancellor, was killed in the

crash of his private plane last
Friday. His wife, sons, Edward
ten and DeForrest, four, his
mother, Ethel are missing and
presumed dead. The crash oc-
cured on Lake Michig-an.
Officiating at the memorial
service will be Dr. Howard C.
Scharfe, minister of the Shady-
side Presbyterian Church. He
will be assisted by Rabbi Rich-
ard Rubenstein and Father Wil-
liam Clancy, Pitt Chaplains.
Dr. Litchfield became chan-

cellor in 1955 and resigned in ‘

1965. In tribute to his ten years
of leadership, Pitt's Sena.tt
Council, the executive body of
the Faculty Senate, recorded his
death “with sorrow.” A resolu-

"tion passed by the group said:

“We owe a great dtbt to Dr.
Litchfield for the creative lead-

 

ership he gave our University.
We shared with him the goal Of
excellence. VVt took pride in the
strides made in strengthening
the faculty in both quality and
numbers.

Of course the question para-
mount in everyone’s mind when
the conference began was “when
will the country find out if Rocky
is or is not a candidate.” “I will
decide one way or another by the
deadline for the Oregon Primary,
which is 'March 22," he answer-
ed.

When asked his views on Viet-

SG PRESIDENT Ken Schueler defends his nomination of Joe Kocinbe:
as Liberal Arts Cabinet chairman to the Senate.

LA Cabinet Chair
Still Up For Grabs

by RICHARD CAMPBELL

More delays and frustration

were thrown into the selection
of the Liberal Arts Cabinet
chairman at Wednesday eve-
n.ing’s meeting of Student Gov-
ernment (SG). At the meeting’s
end the committee still lacked
a chairman as well as an agree-
ment on its punposes and fu-
ture directions.
— The controversy began at last
week's meeting when SG Presi-
demt Ken Schueler’s nomination
of David Ehren-werth was tabled.
Since then many meetings were
held, opinions expressed, and as
a result, a decision reversed.

‘Smokey’ Highlights Greek Week

Smokey Robinson and the
Miracles will highlight the
Greek Week concert Friday,
March 22, at 8:30 p.m. with a
two and a half hour show.
Smokey collected three BMI
awards at the annual ceremony
honoring the top songwriters of
1965.

Smokey gained fame in 1961
with his million selling record-
ing “Shop Around." Since-then
Smokey has not only continued
to lead the Miracles to hit rec-

 

ord after hit record, but has also
established himself as a excel-
lent composer. He has written
songs for groups -such as the
Temptations, the Beatles, and
the Rolling Stones.

Smokey Robinson and the
Miracles «appeared in New York
City, Washinrgton, D. C., Michi-
gan, New Jersey, and Califor-
nia and on several television
shows.

Tickets for the concert will be
placed in balloons Monday,
March 18, at 11:4.-5 sun. at the

  

Bigelow Blvd. entrance to the
Cathedral. Regardless of weath-
er, 800 balloons will be turned
loose at the fountain. Approxi-
mately half of these will con-
tain free complimentary tickets.
The others will contain the word
“Bust.”

Each student complimentary
ticket is plain yellow and is
good for admittance after 7:45
p.m. One ticket per couple is
needed.

For more information on the
concert, call ext. 6318.

  

Wednesday Schueler withdrew
his nomination of Ehrenwerth
and proposed Joe Kociwbes, vice
presidential running mate of Ar-
mand Belly in the last SG cam-
paign, as chairman and Ehren-
werth as his executive coordina-
tor. This combination failed to
gain the necessary two-thirds
Senate sa-pprovlal.

Schueler countered with the
single nomination of Kociubes
for chairman. This was also de-
feated by the Senate.

Retiring LA Cabinet Chair-
mtan Marc Spiegel was allowed
to speak to the Senate, as he
had done one week before in
lodging his di~ssatis1Eaction with
the selection process. He stress-
ed the merit of both candidates
and supported the selection com-
mitt-ee’s decision of the Kociu-
Jbes-led duo.

Later in the meeting Schueler
announced two -committee chair-
manships. They were Frank
Cappelloni as head of the Health
Service Committee and Peter
Cherellia as chairman of the
Student Directory.

Other mentions were made
concerning a suitable memorial
to the late Dr. Edward Litch-
ﬂeld, former chancellor of the
University, an attempt to re-
soilve Oakland parking problems,
and the discontent on the part
o-f some sophomores reganding
t-he szixwhour testing they will
undergo Tuesday.

Stresses Settlement 

 

Problems of Intimacy

Most fairly tales end, “and they live happily ever af-
ter.” Unfortunately life is not like this, as Dr. Rex Pitten-
ger explained March 12, during the’ second of a current
series of lectures he is holding at the YM and WHA in

Oakland.

When a child is in its mother’s womb, there is a case
of “symbiosis.” Symbiosis refers to “two organisms that are living

‘together in a way that is necessary to both of them.” If one dies,

the other is in very serious trouble. The moment the baby is born,
however, this bond is weakened. Then as the child grows older, he
begins to develop individualism. This individualism added to the
other basic characteristics of trust, autonomy, initiative, industry,
and ‘identity all add up to form the delicate balance on which the
“highest form of development of man, intimacy, is based,” says
Dr Pittenger. Dr. Pittcnger deﬁnes «intimacy as “the mature ca-
-pacity for two people to interact.”

An achievement of “real intimacy involves a real understand-
ing.” Each partner brings his own set of experiences to the rela-
tionship, and each must learn to integrate his feeling with his part-
ner’s in order t-o make the relationship meaningful.

Intrinsic in the ‘concept of in-
timacy is the ability to give and
receive. When two people can
give andl; receive without any
anxiety being created, they have
mastered the ultimate feat in
human relations. Dr. Pittenger
stressed that this is not neces-
sarily conﬁned to heterosexual
relationships. “There have been
cases,” asserted Dr. Pittenger,
“when two members of the same
sex have developed a. truely in-
timate relationship. All that is
necessary is that they learn to
give and to receive, and to inter-
act with each other.”

Another important point in
Dr:Pitteng-er’s lectu-re was the
idea of “mutual regulation.” Dr.
Pittenger states that there
should be no completely domi-
nant or passive member in a re-
lationship. Instead the two part-

Attorney

LEON FINE
Discusses Americans in Israel

by ALICE GOLDSMITH

A prominent Israeli district
attorney believes that “Israel
should return all the land she
acquired during the ‘Six Day
War, but only after a true and
lasting peace has been obtain-
ed." Although this means that
Israel would remain a small state
in the midst of an Arab block
of nations, Leon Fine stated that
“Israel should remain a pre-
dominately Jewish state.”

However, in retaining its Jew-
ish a-utonomy, Fine added that
“all rights and freedoms should
be given to all minority groups
living in Israel." The legal sys-
tem in Israel is thus unique, be-
cause the various minority and
ethnic groups “retain residuary
and complete autonomy in all

Student Groups Lose First Battle
In Court Against Hershey Letter

Several student organiza-
tions lost their first deci-
sion in their legal battle
against Selective Service
Director Lewis Hershey’s
letter to local draft boards
recomm e ndi n g reclassiﬁcation
and induction of anti-wlar and
anti-draﬁt demonstrator.

Federal District Judge George
L. Hart, Jr. decided -in Hershey’s
favor in the -suit brought against
him by the Nlati-onal Student
Association, Students for a Dem-
ocraltic Action, and 15 student
body -presidents.

Ill Filﬁhﬂihg down his decision
Hairrt ruled that Hershey’s let-

ter “had no legal effect what-
ever” and he could therefore
not intervene. The key issue was
whether Hershey’s letter was
an order or just an opinion.
Justice Department Attorney
Edwin Weisl argued that it was
only an opinion.

American Civil Liberties Union
attorneys, Harriet Van Tassel
and Melvin Wulf, representing
the students, argued that even
if it was not an official order,
Hershey's letter was inﬂuencing
draft boards to reclassify dem-
onstrators. Judge Hart question-
ed the argument that Hershey’s
letter was keeping students
from exercising their First

Amendment rights to free speech
and association. The students
were asking that Hershey’s let-

ter be declared unconstitutional '

and illegal under the Selective
Service law.

Im.med-iately after the deci-
sion was handed down NSA
President Ed Schwartz said that
the students would appeal. He
added -that the letter was only
made public after a student ask-
ed NSA about it and NSA ask
ed several reporters, who then
question-ed Hershey. “How can
it be considered a public expres-
sion of opinion when it was be-
ing kept secret?” Schwartz ask-
ed.

miasttens of personal origin.”

Although the political struc-
ture of Israel is a theocracy, the
main civil courts are secular an
main civil courts are secular and
are presided over by civil judges.
The Turks who ruled Ralestine
600 years ago were the ﬁrst to
give individual autonomy to
these minority groups. The po-
lici-es were ﬁollowed under the
Brzitish mandate and perpetuated
by the present Israeli govern-
ment und-er a decree by the
Knesset or Parliament.

As a former US citizen, Fine
heads the Association of Ameri-
can and Canadian Residents in
Israel and is especially interest-
ed in the problems which face
American immigrants.

At a noon lecture held Wed:
nesday in 213 CL, Fine stated
that Americans total only 20,-
000 out of a population in ex-
cess of three and one-half mil-
lion people.

In addition to the idealists,
religious radicals and tourists,
businessmen, students and “hip-
pies" are attracted to Israel.
Fine lists two comlpelli-ng ra-
tionales which attract these

Americans to give up their-

American affluence and emi-
garte t-o Israel.

The first is that despite “the
American constitutional safe-
guards and brotherhood, the US
is a Christian state, whereas Is-
rael is a Jewish state. The sec-

ond attraction is the pioneering‘

mystic and search for identity
which entices students to the
Peace Corps. Fine feels that the
desire “to develop a new «society
and new way of life is the great-
est adventur-e which man can
commit himself.

Black Probes Problem

University Faces Challenge

by BARBARA MARKOWITZ
The university is an inte-
gral part of the community.
It is one of the most power-
ful institutions in society.

Its role is to put into per-
spective the problems of so-
ci'ety.

This View of the university
was presented ‘by Dr. Joseph
Black, director of humanities
and social sciences programs for
the Rockefeller Foundation. Dr.
Black spoke Wednesday night
on “World in Crisis: New Chal-
l-en-ge for the -University -and the
Community.”

The university must ﬁace two
cha-rages at opposite extremes,
according to Black. One view is
that the university is “an ivory
tower” that it pay.s no attention
to the problems confronting the
society. Another view is that
the universities have become
tools for big «government and
big busines, that they have “for-
gotten how to criticize” and
hlalve “sold their birthright.” lDr.
Black feels that both arguments
are overgeneralization and that
a distinction rcann-ot be drawn
‘between the university and the
community.

The chief Job of the university
is to create a “community of
the concerned,” contends Black.
He -feels that -the University
ranks high in doing this through

its excellent public relations pro-
gram.

B1-ack presented three case
h-istories relating to the prob-
lems of the university. He point-
ed out that many say that the
war in Vietnam is one of the
dirtiest wars in history and that
the US is acting like like “the
God of the Old Testament.” “Of
events in my lifetime, this war
has shaken every po-le in our so-
ciety more than any other con-
ﬂict,” he .stated.»The university's
role in the Vietnam conflict is
to “keep the prespective and not
poison the atmosphere.”

“The orientation used in the
US regarding the task concern-
ing underdeveloped countries
has been greatly underestimat-

 

ed,” according to Black. He ad-
vocated “better undenstanding
of our changing society," and
the realization that “with cer-
tain kinds of inputs it is possi-
ble to transform nations.”

The urban problem is also
greatly underestimated, con-
tends Black. He said that most
people fail to realize that it in-
volves more than merely a con-
ﬂ:ict between whites -and blacks.
It involves more than just a
conﬂict between many other
minority groups with virtually
no power. “The role of the uni-
versity,” according to Black, “is
to show the true dimensions of
the problems we face through
creating an informed elite and
a concerned public.”

Alard Quartet to Preform
Beethoven, Bach, Brahms

The New York Times has des-
cribed the Allard Quartet as
“four admiralbly balanced instru-
mentallists, who brouaglht vital-
ity, cohesion and solid musician-
ship to their readings.”
Houston Post called them “one
of the ﬁnest ensembles of its
kind.” ‘

This Quartet will present a.
concert on March 19 in the Frilck
Fine [Arts Auditorium. 'Ilheylare

'I‘-he

graduates of the Julliard School

of Music in New York and have
been performing together since
1954. Since they were first or-
ganized in 1954, the Quartet has
given concerts in hundreds of
American cities and at leading
universities throughout the coun-
try. They are the ony chamber
group in history ever to win the
coveted Young Artists Award
of the National Federation of
Music Clubs.

the conflict at this time. He also
stated that he saw no reason why
he would have to venture an opin-
ion on Vietnam even after he
entered the Oregon Primary, if
he does enter.

When queried about the possi-
bility of his entering the race in
order to stop Nixon, Rockefeller
stated, “I would not go into any
act of candidacy just to stop
somebody else.” Rockefeller said
that if he ran, it would be in a
positive aspect, and there would
be no semblance of a stop cam-
paign.

Rockefeller emphatically de-
nied the rumor that he had of-
fered Governor Ronald Reagan
of California the Vice-Presiden-

tial spot on his ticket, saying he
thought it would be quite pre-
Sumptious for him to offer Rea-
gan the job of Vice- President
when he wasn't even an announc-
ed candidate. Governor Rockefel.
ler said that he felt that any Re-
publican candidate has a very
good chance of defeating Presi-
dent J oolmsovn in September.
Governor Rockefeller then stat-
ed that he wasn't trying to be
003’. but ‘_‘this is an extremely
serious time and a very impor.
tant decision, so I must give it
a full consideration before I make

a decision."’ He then said that he I

will support the nominee no mat-
ter who it is, and on this com-
ment the Governor closed the
press conference.

An Appraisal of Four Years

My four years as an undergraduate have been spent working as
a student reporter for The Pitt News. Four years is a relatively short
period of time, but in these four years, the University has had four
different chancellors, in addition to considerable changes in the key per-
sonnel in its student affairs staff.

We now have become the predominantly commuter school that we
were years ago, instead of a school where over two thirds of our stu-
dents reside in the dormitories, as in 1964. We are now state-related,
and consequently most of our student body is from Pennsylvania, in con-
trast to the close to 40 per cent from other states and nations four years
ago. The school has changed phenomenally in my four years, so that
I ca.n hardly believe that it is the same institution. We have gone through
a period of tremendous change and it would be premature to judge that
our course "will be downhill, as many pessimists like to think. We rose
once before, and the potential is there to rise again.

While our school has changed enormously in my four years, the
plight of the concerned student has not. Students have made strides,
but they have been thwarted time and again by administrators who make
promises they never keep. I am deeply disappointed in certain members
of. our student affairs staff at this University. Unlike the administrative
hierarchy, the primary concern of our student affairs personnel ostensibly
is us, they have let us down.

They have promised us that-srteps would be taken to achieve a
students’ union, but nothing was done. They have promised they would

_ work on solutions to secure money for a student discount in the Book

Center, such as selling soft goods in the Student Union, but nothing was

done.
I have heard from informed sources that the key personnel in stu-

dent affairs will be promoted shortly. The people who will be promoted
have one thing in common: they have spent but a few years, if that, in
student affairs at our University. They have also failed to demonstrate
any but token support for students. I don’t know what kind of criteria
our student affairs area is judged on, but as one critic told me, too
many of our student affairs personnel appear to be working more for
themselves than the students. They can’t defend us, at the expense of
inconveniencing the University by recommending changes are often costly,
so they remain silent and move up the administrative ladder. We stu-
dents have no salary bonuses to entice administrators; our bargaining
positions could conceivably appear weak in their eyes in that they can
often get away with not complying with our requests. This could never

justify their lack of cooperation in my eyes; it only makes me questionﬁ

the role of student affairs administrators and their perspective.

This is not to say that all administrators fit this stereotype. An
outstanding exception is our Chancellor Emeritus David Kurtzman
who went out of his way to deal with students’ requests and maintained
an open-door policy in fact instead of theory. Acting Provost Charles
H. Peake and Vice Chancellor for Development A. C. Van Dusen have
done their part to open the door to better communications. Dean of the
College James H. Kehl, Engineering Dean Harold Hoelscher, and Director
of Admissions Bernard Kobosy have been completely cooperative. There
are not many other names I could add to this list.

I have painted a pessimistic picture, because after four years, I
know that the odds are against us. But once we stop trying, we have lost

all. I urge freshmen, sophomores, and juniors to do their part to repre-Q

sent the students. The learning experience gained here is worth every
heartache.—-by Linda Goldstein.

. young skipper. of the boat-which

on its feet after the war, and
I’m positive that when the Viet-
nam war is over America Will
send aid and men to rebuild
Vietnamese society. -

It takes two s-ides to ﬁght a
war. Many clamor for the US
to pull out. Why doesn’t North
Vietnam pull -out? A number
of Vietnik-s insist without con-
crete proof that the NLF repre-

— sents the mind of South Viet-

nam.

In fact, the NLF does not rep-
resent the people of South Viet-
nam any more than Dr. Spock
and the Students for a Demo-
cnatic Society represent the US.

The people bf Vietnam want
peace and security like most
other humans. But what makes
-the anti-administration support-
ers have any assurance whatso-
ever that the Communists if
they would -or could take over
provide su-ch a life?

Do the Vietniks remember the

masses killed .by Stalin's red

regime? Do they remember the
brutal way the Hungarian free-
dom revolution was crushed?
Does Chairman Mao rule with a
gentle and tolerating hand? Do
the Cuban refugees leave their
homeland because of minor dif-
ferences with their benovolent
dictator? Who built the Berlin
Wall to keep the truth from
entering the minds and hearts
of their captive people? Why
isn't religion tolerated in many
Communist countries an why
is it forcibly suppressed? Why
were six Christian Aliance mis-
sionaries killed by the Viet
Cong? Why are men like Bish-
op Walsh or Cardinal Midze-nrty
imprisoned or forced to seek
-asylum? Finally, why are little
Vietnamese girls and families of
South Vietnamese officers butch-
ered by the Communists and
why are Viet Cong conscripts
chained to machine guns?

If one thinks about these facts
or reads a little history, he sees
there are reasons for this be-
havior. It is all justified by the
Communist Code—-of the states’
good before all else. Hard Lline
Communism tolerates no vocal
opposition.

Last Thursday I heard the

sailed twice to North Vietnam
with medical aid. He was very
impressive -in h-.is dedication and
sincerity. But in a-ddition to his
presenting of the North Viet-
namese people as kind, warm,
and human, she also admitted

that the recent murders of chil-

dren and wives of ARVN offi-
cers was probably ordered and
planned by Communist officers.
He also said the press is all
government controlled in Hanoi.

His idea is that if the US pulls
out, the horrors of war will be
over and the Communist gov-
ernment which will take over in
“no more than two days” will
not conduct mass executions. I
will partially agree to that last
statement, but only if the peo-
ple accept -their Communist mas-
ters, will execu-ti-ons be forestall-
ed. How else can a totalitarian
regime establish itself?

If the people of Vietnam want
Oormnunism that is their priv-
ilege. But until that is proven
to -be the case, the war, bloody
and cruel as it is, must go on.
However slight the chance may
be, perhaps the Communists will
see that the people of Vietnam

don’t want a gun toting Redd

dictators-hip, and maybe they
will end the war and show
how peace loving they really
are.

Pitt Problems

Editor, The Pitt News:
In continuation of the follow-

ing. I have recently expressed

my thoughts pertinent to -the

role of this great University of
ours among other such com-
munity institutional devices. So
what? And thusly lies, our in-
adequacies. Trimulastions speak
for themselves, but not for
others. V, A

In example. More than once
have we seen Saga Food go hun-A-
gry. The University Health Serv-
ices requires hospitalization. To
say nothing. Such troubles need
no further exhortation in the
mode of pu*blication for use as
a political gamut. We have other
perpendicularities to take to the
attention of those concerned
with governing not only this
University, of which we can all
be interdigeous, and not only
those of the Federal and State

-Governments, but also to the

others. _
And why not? There is the

oft quoted Credibility Gap ﬂora‘;

one.‘ Its debulation is sinking.
Should we continue to concur
with those whom we know full
well to be out of place in their
excoriations o-f the War in Costa
Rica? And the Credibility Gap
exists right here in our very
own beloved Oakland. Don't you
better believe it.

I only regret that I have no
sufficient space to explain my
orthodox views on any subject.
Pardon’ the pu-n.

As I am -gradu.-a-ting in May,
this will be my last contribution
to the Pitt News. I express my
sincerest desires to the editors
and cast of a «truly ﬁne publica-
tion as the Skyscraper Capsule.
But may the Owl ﬂy up there.
May it never be said that I was
ever not unworthy of ink space.
My four years have been fruity
ones.

by RUTH ZAPLIN

“By 1965, Israel achieved the
industrial breakthrough after
which the influx of foreign in-
dustry was not important,” as-
serted Dr. Allen Pol-lack in a
Monday lecture held at the YM
and WHA. His lecture was one
of a series sponsored by the Se-
der Educational Center.

Dr. Pollack I‘allS€Cl the ques-
tion of whether or not a viable
economy could be created with-
in the practical limitations of
both Israel's position in the cur-
rent world and its traditional
concern with social justice.

“Because of the great inﬂux
of money into the State since
the Six-Day War, Israel has

been forced to mlaint-ain a larger‘

army than before. She will also
be forced in the future to spend
a great deal of money on mod-
ern weapons,” he added.

Commenting on Israel's eco-
nomy before 1965, Dr. Pollack
stated, “Israel had a tremen-
dous desire to raise her stan-
dard of living but she did not
have a normal situation in
which to work because of three
dilemmas. First of all, Israel’s
defense commitment placed one-
third to one-half of linvestments
into armor instead of the eco-
nomy.

Second, there was a tripling
of the population in less than
two decades creating the prob-
lem of supplying jobs for a
seemingly endless manpower.

Third, the social -commitment
of Israel to her people had stunt-
ed Israel economically. Israel
did not want an economy based
on the same principles of West-
ern economy. Their economy
was to be based on their social

ideals and the Jewish State.”

Asserted Dr. Pollack, “Since
Israel had no real mineral wealth
on a large scale, she had to
model her economy like that of
Japan. In other words. she had
to import the raw materials, re-
make the raw materials and
then export the ﬁnished prod-
uct.

“However,” commented Dr.
Pollack, “there were plus fac-
tors operating to improve the
Israeli economy. The popul-aition
was idealistic and their commit-
ment to Israel allowed them to
work hard. Also, the outpour-

 

ing of advanced taxes showed
that the Israelis were ready to
make large sacriﬁces for their
state.”

Other plus factors operating
on the growth of the Israeli eco-

nomy were the amounts of mon-

ey per capita that were received
in foreign aid. Said Dr. Pollack,
“With the capital from abroad,
Israel could integrate the new
population and build the society
i-t wanted to. Finally, more coun-
tries we-re ready to buy Israeli
goods because -of the sympathy
Israel aroused -around the
World.”

The third section began with

The “Fantasy” is a medley of
four folk songs characterizing
the pro-vincialism o-f American
ballads. The medley started
with a Negro spiritual, then al-
luded to a Virginia ballad, “Old

about the trials of lo-vers in I

WHY THE DRAFT?

The Case for a Volunteer Army

By James C. Miller I/I (Editor), David B. Johnson,
Cotton M. Lindsay, Mark V. Pauly, Joseph M.
Sco/nick, Jr., Robert D. To//ison, Thomas D. Wil/ett

Senator Edward W. Brooke
A PENGUIN PAPERBACK ORIGINAL

WIIY Tllli DRAFT? is a book that every thoughtful
r\incri(‘.an will want to read, consider and discuss in
this important clcction year.

Scvcn young political economists take a critical but
objcctiyc look at the draft in all its aspects and at
the alternatives to it. They conclude that conscrip-
tion in any form is inequitable and then examine in
detail the advantages and problems of a volunteer

“This is an excellent piece of work by a group of
men of sound professional training and of the rele-
vant age and concern. Policy on the draft has always
been made by the old and the aging, and never so
much as now, and by the specialists in cliché and tra-
dition. This fresh view is exceedingly welcome and I,
for one, hope it will be highly influential.”

Concerning I~sraeCl’s present

“The standard -of liivinig rose
rapid-ly yet Israelis base indus-

Israel decided to ‘reshuffle the

“I think you can measure
a company’s interest in
its people by its willingness
to invest in them!’

“I joined IBM in June, ’65, in operations research.

“I liked the work well enough, but after a year and a half, I began to
think that the ideal ﬁeld for me was computer programming. (This is
Alvin Palmer, an Associate Programmer at IBM.)

“But by this time, I was making a pretty good salary. So I was faced with _

a big question. Would IBM be willing to let me move into a new ﬁeld
which would mean going to school and not being productive for a while?

“The answer was ‘yes.’ I went to programming school fulltime for three , 6

months. And IBM continued to pay my full salary.

“I get a tremendous kick out of programming. You’re telling a computer
how to do its job, and it really gets you involved. Maybe because you’re
continually solving problems.”

You don’t need a technical degree
“Your major doesn’t matter. There
are plenty of programmers at IBM
with degrees in liberal arts or business.
What counts is having a logical mind.

“I’m making good progress in this ﬁeld,
so I’m glad I was able to make the
change. I think it indicates how far
IBM will go to help you make the most of
your abilities.”

Al’s comments cover only a small part of
the IBM story. For more facts, visit your
campus placement oﬂice. Or send an outline.

Velvet Underground ‘Not Dull’

by JOE ANDERSON

WHITE LIGHT/WHITE HEAT (V6-5046) is
the second edition of the Velvet Underground's
sadistic house of horrors. Like a disfigured, blood-
smeared pendulum it swings between the sensuous
plane of the primitive, percussive nerve-throb and
the expressive realm of the perverse descriptive
lyric. There is nothing dull or pedestrian about the
Velvet Underground.

The first cut on the album is “White Light /
White Hea ” and it starts with the song already in
progress. The musical structure is one which is
common to most Velvet Underground songs-—-a
strong, fast moving, train-like rhythm created by
a pounding piano player and heavy, repetitious
guitar runs. This forceful, pulsating effect, com-
ing as unexpectedly as it does, engulfs the listener
in a sea of primitive. awareness from which there
is no escape. When “white light comes you go -in-
sane” and “white heat it tickles way down to your
toes.” ‘

“The Gift” might easily be mistaken as the
product of some freshman English course. A dis-
interested Truman Capote type narrative follo-ws
the plight of one Waldo Jeffers who, driven by the
anxieties of separated love, decides to mail himself
to ,his high school sweetheart, Marsha.

When the cardboard box containing Waldo ar-
rives at her home, Marsha finds the box so se-
curely sealed that it becomes necessary to use a
sheet metal cutter. The usual methods fail to
open the box so Sheila, Marsha’s friend, lifts the

cutter over her head and thrusts it deeply into the
box, impaling Waldo’s head in the process. ’ Of
course this splits Waldo’s skull and “caused little
nicoggs of red to pulsate gently in the sun.”

The macabre, grotesque imagery of the Velvet
Underground reaches its high point in “Lady
Godiva’s Operation.” It is here that the brutal,
descriptive lyrics of Lou Reed have their most
penetrating effect. In the operating room the nurs-
es smile sweetly while the attendants strap the
body of Lady Godiva to the table where it" com-
mences to “wither and writhe under the white
light.” After the count of ten her head ceases to
move and the good doctor rather haphazardly
makes his incisions (one goes here/one goes there).
One never does learn whether or not the operation
was a success.

“Sister Ray,” all seventeen minutes of it, is
probably the most significant song the Velvet Un-
derground have done to date. As a “long song” it
is instrumentally one of the best, ranking with
such masterpieces as the Stones’ “Going Home”
and the Butterfield Blues Band's “East-West.”

The endocrine nerve thrill of the Velvet Un-
derground’s WHITE LIGHT / WHITE HEAT is an
important contribution to the fast expanding field
of contemporary rock music. What writers like
William Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg accomplish
through prose and poetry the Velvet Underground
achieve through song. They describe a way of life,

 

 

  

  

  

 

Prospects View Pitt
In Weekend Programs

by BRUCE LEVENSON
Du-rin-g the Weekend -at -IPitt
program, 336 high school stu-
-dents visited the University,
many of th-em accompanied by
their ‘parents. The two-d-ay pro-

" gram was sponsored by the Stu-

dent Government (SG) Secon-
dary Schools Committee headed
by Allan Bauer.

The weekend ‘began Saturday

' ‘morning at 8 with registration.

At 10, the visitors went to the
Student Union Ballroom and
Supper Room to hear speeches

— gfrom Chancellor Wesley Posvar

an-d other school -administrators.
During the afternoon the stu-
dents attended classes and tour-
ed the camp-us. Alpha Phi Om-e-

I’ — gya served as guides at each

building. Bauer described the
t-our as a “complete success”

“ . 1 but “exhausting.”

The parents, who were not
permitted on the t-our, went to

a social gathering held on the

12th ﬂoor CL from 2 to 4 p.m.
Dean of Women Sta-Vina S-kewis

I. and Dean of Men Herbert Mc-

Gibbeny served as hosts.
These activities were follow-

 ed by a dance in the Student

Union Ballroom from 4 to 6 p.m.

._ The Children of Stone provided

electric sounds but most -of the
people were “too tired to dance”
according to Bauer.

A dinner in the Towers cafe-
teria preceded an evening con-
cert held at Scaife Hall. The
concert featured the Men's Glee
Club and included other student
singing organizations. Bauer de-
scribed «the turnout for the event
as d-irsapnpointing in -comparison
-to the events held earlier in the
day.

The weekend concluded Sun-
day at noon after a panel of

speakers representing the In-
terfratern-ity Oouncil, Pan.hel.l-
enic Council, Pitt News, Student
Government, Association -of
Women Students. and the Ath-
letic Department spoke about
their organizations. Afterward,
a question - and - answer period
took p-lace. Bauer considered
the discussion “very good" be-
cause “a wide range of ques-
tions were asked.”

Bauer called the weekend a
success but felt that there were
not enough out-of-town -students
in attendance. He recommends
that the’ administration “take
close scrutinization of itself as
to why more out-of-town stu-
dents are not coming to Pitt.”
He also suggests that the im-
portant events on the weekend
program take place before Sat-
urday evening. Many of the
Pit-tsburghers went home for
dinner Saturday night and did-
n't come back until Sunday. In
addition, a lot of the outof-
towners found other sources of
entertainment in Pittsburgh Sat-
urday night.

Th-e most signiﬁcant point
about the weekend was the fav-
o-rable response of the visiting
students. The muajority of the
students «told Bauer that they
are considering the university
as their ﬁrst or second choice.
Many other told him that they
are planning «to enroll here in
the future.

Panther Nine Opens ampaign In Calif.
Baseball Team Invades

by JERRY L. GBUEBEL

The Baseball team traveled to the West Coast last
night, not fully prepared for the full week’s schedule
ahead of them. Beginning Monday, the slate includes Kan-
sas, Oregon, UCLA, California, Mississippi State,’ Tennes-
see, Brigham Young, and Disneyland.

With the weather in Pittsburgh back to normal, i.e., snow and
low temperatuse, the mitters were once again confined to indoor

seven: teams from all over the nation. Smith, a
senior, hit over .300 last year, and Coach Bobby
Lewis is relying on a similar showing this season.

Adams Reviews Easterns

Mat Frosh Enter at Stevens

by ROY JACOBS

While seven varsity matmen resumed practice earlier this week in preparation for
the N.C.A.A. championships at Penn State next weekend, three freshman grapplers were
setting their sights on winning the Stevens Trade Tournament tomorrow.

Mark Payne at 145, Bob Kuhn at 160, and Ralph Cindrich at heavyweight are the only representa-
tives being sent to Lancaster, Pa. by fresh coach Bob Fehrs. Both Payne and Kuhn are undefeated, while
Cindrich has lost only once—and that was due’ to an accident.

On the other hand, varsity coach Dave Adams hopes to send seven of his squad to the nationals. The
only questionmark is Ron Schuchert at 137. Schuchert injured his left shin in last weekend’s EIWA consola-
tion finals.

runner-up at 123, going down to
115; Dick Shildt, going down from
130 to 123; Larry Cuba, going
down from 145 to 130; Paul Al-
len, at either 167 or 177; Terry
Hoover, third in the East at
heavyweight, at 191; and Tony
Truitt, at heavyweight.

 
 
 
  
  
 
   
 
  
   
 
 
  
 

Although Adams’ main concern
is planning ahead for the nation-
als and next season, he still found
time to reflct on his squad’s im-
proved showing in the Eastems
this year.

“The whole group did a good
job,” reviewed Adams. “We
jumped ten places over last year
and scored 30 more points.”

RON SCHUCHERT, shown here moments before he was forced to quit
because of a shin injury, finished fourth in the Easterns. Schuchert
will go to the nationals at Penn State next week if his injury clears up.

Thre was the feeling, among
many fans last weekend that this
year’s tournament was missing
that somthing special that makes
th Easterns so exciting. Adams
disagreed.

“I thought it was a good tourna-
ment,” he remarked. “I don't
think we had the outstanding
wrestlers that were there last
year, but overall, I thought the
wrestling was pretty even.”

practices.

However, baseball coach Bobby Lewis has been

able to decide

upon his starting team. Dave Welty, George McKenzie. and Tom

Stickel will be in the outfield
from left to right. And when Wel-
ty is pitching, Lewis will. choose
from his three sophomore out-
fielders, depending on whether a
left-handed or right-handed pitch-
er is hurling.

Lewis’s infield will consist of
Senior Tom Smith at first base,
Senior Rick Mack at second base,
Ken Cooke at shortstop, and Ken
Snyder at the hotsack position.

Sam Glass, who is presenly re-
covering from a minor toe ‘injury,
will handle the catching chores.

Lewis plans to use four or five
starters in the tournament; All-
America Dave Welty will of
course open the spring training
schedule against Kansas. After
Welty, Lewis will most definitely
use gridders George Medich and
Frankie Gustine. Three of the
four pitchers remaining on the
roster will also get the starting
nod.
“We’re going to California a
little dark,” said Lewis, not know-
ing how his team is going to hit.
“But we’ll have a few intra-
squad games over the week-end
before we start the season. That
practice will help a little.”

Due to the lack of practice,
Lewis is hesitant to predict how
his team will do in the Riverside
National Collegiate Baseball Tour-
nament. ‘

“I think we’ll hold our own,”
said Lewis earnestly. “I’d like to
think that we’re going to win
every game.”

Lewis doesn't think Kansas.

Brigham Young, or Oregon have
had more practice than his
squad. However, the Panther
baseballers will" be at an obvious
disadvantage for the remainder
of the slate, particularly against
the three California entries.
“UCLA and UCR have the only
real edge over us,” explained
Lewis. “UCLA has played 20
games and California has played
14, so they've had ample time to
work out their mistakes."
Needless to say, the‘ baseball
team, which is being treated to
a visit of Disneyland, has not
been there before; so they won't
know what to expect. However,
if the mitters fare well in the
tournament in Riverside, Disney-

JIM BANNER
Reviews Winter Season

Banner felt that the perform-
ance of the freshmen helped the
varsity, while the varsity shared
their track experience with the
fresh. ‘?It was just one big mu-
tual aid society up in the Field
House this year," joked Banner.

The added experience thart the
varsity gave the "fresh helped
turn a year which Banner ex-
pected to be good into one that
was great.

“I thought that we would have
a good year with the iireshmen,
but I didn't expect it to be so
great. It was very pleasing to
say the least.” he said.

Boys who performed well but
never received the headlines
were middle-disrtancemen Rudy
Hufnagel and Dick Werner and
long distanceman Mike Nolan.

A couple of football players
and a long, lanky hundler also
helped brighten the fresh’-s 4-0
season. Sprinters Dave Gtalrnett
and Mike O’C-onnell beat just
about everyone in sight and car-
ried their ﬁne performances into
a couple -of invitational meets. ’

Grider Bill Bilconis teamed
up with Elliot Drysdale to give
the fresh a strong duo in the
hurdles. “Both of them looked
real good in the hurdles this
season and show a great detail
of promise," Banner said.

With the outdoor track season
only a few weeks away, Banner
looks past it to the time when
both his varsity and freshmen
tnack teams will be overshadow-
-ing other teams and not each
other.

'68 CHEVROLET
prices start lower than any other

full-size models. Look at it. Chev-
rolet’s 4-door sedan is roomier than

' any, other American car except one

luxury sedan. Drive it. You tell by its
smooth and silent ride that Chevrolet
quality runs deep. Buy it! Get a Chev-
rolet instead of a medium-priced name
and you can have, say, power steering,
power brakes and a radio besides!

 

’68 CHEVELLE

prices start lower than any other
mid-size models. Obviously nothing’s
newer in mid-size cars than Chevelle.
There’s fresh styling, the long-hood,
short-deck look. There are two nimble-
footed wheelbases now—both on a
wider, steadier tread. You get big—car
power, big-car ride in a quick-size
package. No wonder Chevelle outsells
everything in its field.

   

hevy ll Nova Coupe

’68 CHEVY II NOVA

prices start lower than any other
economy car so generously sized.
Nova is big enough for a family on va-
cation, yet it slips into parking spaces
others pass by. With its new wide
stance and computer-tuned chassis,
Nova rides as silent and steady as cars
costing a lot more, and it comes with
the biggest standard V8 in its field.
Nova’s the not-too-small car.

NOW.-—lMPALA V8 SALE! Save on specially equipped Sport Coupe, 4-Door Sedan or Station Wagons!
