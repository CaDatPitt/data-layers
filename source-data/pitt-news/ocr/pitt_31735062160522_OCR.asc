State Funds Split Legislature N0“°“0't Ed“°"i<J'5 C0"

BY N.J. BROWN

The_ overdue appropriations to
the state-related universities con-
tinues to be disputed between
House‘ Republicans and Senate
Democrats. A . .

Originally the state funding
measure received a five per cent
increase by the House but a six per
cent increase and change from
quarterly to monthly payments
from the Senate. The enate

revisions forced the bill. into a_

House-Senate conference commit-
tee. Democrats agreed to a
compromise 5‘/2 per cent but
Republicans refused, though con-
curring with the monthly pay-
ments.
' The legislature adjourned for a
two week election recess last week
with the issue still unresolved.
According to Rep. Jack Seltzer
(R-Lebanon County) just a single
vote is preventing ﬁnalization of
the appropriations. “All we need
is one vote_ from a Senate
committee member for the bill to
pass," Seltzer said. He was
referring to the fact that the
House-Senate conference committ-
ee, composed of three members
from the House and three from the
Senate, requires two votes from
each side for a bill to pass.
Seltzer said the committee is one
Senate vote shy of finalization.
Seltzer, Rep. Frank O’Connell
(R-Luzerne County) and Sen.
Richard Frame, Senate minority
leader, have agreed to the five per
cent increase and to monthly

payments. Senators Thomas Lamb
(D-Allegheny County) and Henry J.
Cianfrani (D-Philadelphia), the
other two Senate committee mem-
bers, have not. Rep. James
Gallagher (D-Bucks County) is the
other House member.

“The position of the Senate is
that the universities should receive
at least six per cent over last year’s
appropriation,” explained Lamb,
Senate Majority Leader. “This is
really only enough to keep
operating and is actually within
Presidential guidelines.

“The Republicans are more
concerned with creating a surplus
that they can return.”

Lamb noted the Democrats have
compromised their original position
and feels the Republicans should
do the same. “The Republicans’
whole approach bothers me,” he

Blames «U.S. imperialism

For Nixon's

BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

Several newspapers have called
for President Nixon to resign
because of growing entanglements
in the iWatergate case, while others
have challenged suggestions that
the'President is losing the ability to
govern. ' '

The New York Times, citing what‘

it called “the visible —disintegration
of President Nixon's moral and
political authority," said Sunday
Nixon should resign before the
nation is forced to go through “the

traumatic and divisive process of"

impeachment.” ~. g

- Other * carrying editorials that
urged Nixon to resign included
three newspaper_s_~which supported
him in the past: the Detroit News,
the Denver Post, and the Atlanta

  Allencle's Aolvisor Analyzes. Coup

BY LARRY PLATT
The recent Chilean coup d’etat
was analyzed through self-pro-
claimed “Marx_ist—Leninist” eyes
by an advisor to the late President

' Salvador Allende.

Edward Boorstein,- assistant to
Allende’s chief economic advisor,
declared last week to an audidence

of over 200. “U.S. imperialism is

responsible for what happened in

Forcl's Confirmation Soon

Says Rules Chairman

WASHINGTON AP —- The
chairman of the Senate Rules
Committee said Sunday the hear-
ings on Rep. Gerald R. Ford's
nomination to be vice president

probably will end withinitwo
weeks.
Sen. Howard W. Cannon,

D-Nev., indicated that most of the
questions raised by the FBI’s
investigation of the Michigan
Republican had been cleared up,
and the remaining questions will be
looked into Monday when the
hearings, which began ‘Thursday,
resume.

“It would take a short period of
time to work up our report and
make our recommendations to the
Senate," he said on the CBS
television program “Face the
Nation.”

Referring to questions about‘

President Nixon resigning or being
impeached, Cannon said he did not

want to see F_ord’s nomination

, Judiciary Committee will

“held hostage to anything else."

However, he said mail from his
constituents “is reflecting a strong
urging to delay action on the Ford
nomination until the matter is
actually settled, . because they
believe Mr. Nixon is likely to resign
and they don’t want to see him
have the opportunity to appoint his
own replacement.”

Saying that while he. as
committee chairman, did not
“want to assume responsibility for
delay"~ of the Ford nomination,

Cannon cited a needto examine‘

Ford's position so he can be judged
by the American people.

“We could very well be
conﬁrming the next president of
the United States," he said. There
is no ﬁrm word on when the House
begin
hearings on Ford, ' but Majority
Leader Thomas P. O'Neill Jr..
D-Mass.. predicted approval of
Ford is likely by the second week of
December. '

Chile" but “the Chilean revolution
is going to rise again-this time with
ﬁre.” - .
Boorstein immediately attacked
the notion that Chile has a history

‘of military non-intervention and

that it has ‘been a “land without
coups.”

“Nothing could be more bunk
than that,” ‘the economist said.
“When the armed services didn’t
have to interfere, they didn’t,
although ‘they never felt, em-
harassed when they had to
interfere.” '

He claimed, a history of over-
‘throws. have taken place since
Chile’s independence in the early

19th century, and that they have

been triggered by" the actions of
foreign imperialist nations like the

United States and England.

According to Boorstein the latest
coup developed when Allende’s
Popular Unity party offended the
interests of American imperialists
and the Chilean oligarchy.

Dividing the imperialists into two
groups-the “impatient and the
patient," Boorstein said they- had
“differences in tactics but not in
goals." ,

He identiﬁed International Tele-
phone and Telegraph (ITT) as an

. “impatient” "actor because the

multi-national corporation had of-
fered $1 million to any group which
would prevent Allende from taking
ofﬁce. I l '

Focusing primarily _on the “pa-
tient" imperialists, Boorstein said
the US could afford to wait and thus
followed a “low proﬁle" strategy.
The US “overtly maintained only
correct relations with Chile” while
they “strangled them below the
table,” Boorstein alleged.

He said this was accomplished
through an economic squeeze such
as credit reductions so as to
“soften the government for the
coup." A

Meanwhile, the Indianapolis Star  
and the Omaha World-Herald were i_ ,

among newspapers disputing argu-

ments that Nixonrhas lot the ability . "I if

created in the minds of the people

‘the enduring conviction" that Mr.

“The one last great service that

The Detroit News, which sup-V , .

should resign after Rep. Gerald R..

president.

“If he does not resign, serious-

The Atlanta Journal, which also  * ' j

According to Chuck Steeber, of
College Young Republicans, House

‘ff-g‘The rationale is that the cash

He added that Republicans esti-
rjiate these monthly payment

increase over last year‘s ﬁgures.

opinion the Democrats are johnny-

Lamb, however had no praise for

the. initial appropriation increase "

made by House members. “The
House feels ﬁve per cent is
sufficient." Lamb said. “They
point to the fact that the Governor

than 56,000 votes.

Since then the Mayor’s' popular-
ity has swelled to the’ level of
Mayor John Lindsay of New York
and Mayor Richard Daley of
Chicago. But the lrishman’s ballot
box tomorrow_contains more than
just “lucky charms." _

The maverick Democrat has
found himself-..surrounded by an
ever-growing circle of wolves since
he entered office. Yet, with the
support of the majority of the
people hephas not only kept them at
bay, but has all but ignored them.

Flaherty has lived up’ to his
campaign pledge. of being “-his own
man." The old party machine no

longer funnels its sentiments to the,

mayor for action because the mayor
simply isn't listening.

. F|aherty’s independence has
done much in the way of removing

former ’ corruption ‘ in city govern-

ment,,., particularly the patronage
system. But his critics, chieﬂy City
Council, charge him with going to
the opposite and equally undesir-
able extreme, saying he is totally
uncooperative and uncompromis-
ing.

Councilman Richard Caliguri,
Flaherty’s most prominent oppon-
ent last May, said. “We've got a
city where a one-man rule is trying
to establish itself ‘as a machine...

Pittsburgh is toobig to be a’one~

man operation.”

The purse has been the hinge of
most of Flaherty’s popularity and
his criticism. Since he entered
office he has followed a strict

there are fundamental problems
that tie it together. There are
major social problems that could be
overcome because we have the
necessary economic resources. We
have the resources to overcome

pollution, racism, poverty-, inade-

quate housing, health care. mass

transit. sexism, and so forth--the

general major urban problems.
Yet, these problems are not

 

 
  
  
  
  
   
  
 
   
    
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
   
 
   
  
  
   
   
  
  
    
   
  
  
  
   
  

program of austerity, which un-‘
erringly benefits the taxpayer.
The Mayor has managed to greet
the taxpayers with tax cuts in each
of the past two years. Asserts the

Mayor, “We have .not only been‘

able to hold the tax line but have
reduced real estate taxes and
eliminated the City's 1 percent
wage tax. Besides giving ‘a

welcome boostto the economy and '

‘much-needed tax relief too for
homeowners and wage-earners
alike, this responsible fiscal
management has helped develop a
favorable tax climate so necessary
to attracting new industry and jobs
into the area."

Caliguri criticized that the
surpluses which accumulated
should have been put to ’much
better use in more needed areas,
such as several social welfare
programs which were .abandoned
by the federal government. Said
the Councilman, “When do we
have a little compassion for these
people?”

Flaherty_’s austerity program has
caused critics of his administration

‘ to see him as a general obstruction
to anything new in Pittsburgh.
Said Caliguri, .“There is no new
construction. Our vitality is
ebbing. We need a Renaissance
2."

The big issue is Skybus, which
Flaherty has unfailingly fought
because of the cost factor.
Opponents argue that the thrifty
Mayor is only following a program
of “short-sighted austerity” and by

and his

being overcome because the
resources are owned and controlled
by private corporations that use the
resources to make profits and not to
solve the social problems. If it is
profitable, the needs will be met. If
it is -unprofitable they will not be
met.

Here we have at small minority
controlling an entire economy in
which the majority work and livein.
This economiccontrol undermines
whatever political democracy we
have. ,

Q: What do you propose to do
about it? ,

LeBlanc: We have to establish
social ownership and control over
the economy so they can be used
radically to overcome social pro-
.blem's. There should be a vast
expansion of social services, health
and child care, housing. mass
transit and so forth.

And this expansion should not be

' financed by the wages and salaries
of blue collar working people or by
the taxes on the property of the
working class. but by taxing the
profits of corporations.

At the same time we can work /to
increase democratic control over

’ the governmental apparatus by
setting up community organization.

This is_ all in the step of
transforming capitalism into socia-
lism. This has to happen not just in
Pittsburghbut nationally. We are
just a part of a whole social
movement from Boston to Houston,
from Atlanta to San Francisco.
We're running national elections as
well. .

Q: What are the theoretical
differences between your campaign
and Flalzertyls‘?

LeBlanc:
ordinary capitalist political candi-
datlss. We do not say, “vote for

 

We differ from the‘

\

delaying‘ inevitable projects such as
Skybus, the City is going to have to
pay more for the same thing
tomorrow because of inflationary
costs. ' ' C

The Mayor has also been under

‘attack for his “inaccesibility.”

Staff writer Thomas Hritz of the
Post-Gazette charges that Flaherty
“is the first mayor who has made a
practice of avoiding local news
media.’'_ “

Writes Hritz, “Flaherty, how-

ever, refuses to grant personal
interviews (unless the reporter is
from some out-of-town or national
publication) and he refuses to
answer or. return a phone call.”
Responds the Mayor, “Well, I
guess I have the right to do it.”
But as a “closed-door” mayor,
Flaherty has not lost the trust and
support of the majority of the
people, which is ‘why at the
moment he seems invincible to
both his friends.and his foes.

me and I’ll setyou free.’ We say
these problems must-be overcome
by independent social movements.‘

This is a form of building,» like

the anti-war movement, women’s

movement, and the black move-
ment--whenever people are strug-
gling are involved. This is the only
way oppress/ed groups can be sure
their interests will be defended.

The existence of these move-
ments by more and more people
will come to see socialism as the
answer. _As a result socialists will
start winning elections. * If
somehow we wereto be in power
and take over the governmental
apparatus without the active
support of the people we would be
as helpless as Allende was.

Q: What do you mean when you
don’t say “vote for me and I’ll set
youfree? '
. LeBlanc: I mean these social
problems will only be solved by the.
organized support of the working‘
people. I'm not talking about a
white blue collar worker about 40
years old. I’m talking about most
people in the society. The only way
we can carry out policies is to rely
on the organized support of the
people who elect us. We try to

_ stress this point--we are not saying

vote for me and I will establish
socialism in Pittsburgh. lt’s a,
much more serious problem than
that. .

The industries can be run
without pollution, maybe with
fewer profits, but it can be done. If
the corporations don’t want to run
the companies without pollution
they shouldn't be permitted to
exist. We just can't permit that.
lt’s irresponsible. '

Q: Would you explain your
proposal to levy a 100% tax on all‘
income over $30,000 so that

$30,000 would be the limit that, an .

individual could make?

«LeBlanc: $30,000 can assure a
family with a very decent life
particularily when they are getting
free health care and transportation.
So there should be a limit to what
someone can make. How many
yachts and houses does one man
need? ,

We are saying that every person
from the Mellons down to the most
impoverished welfare person
should have a right to a decent life.
Did you ever read a book called Up
the "Organization? It's ‘about
acapitalist who made Avis what it

is today. Very facinating book. It‘

applys the Theory Y theory of
Dougley McGregor. lt’s about

what makes a person work and do a ‘
’ good job. 0

, The standard notion is the carrot
and stick theory. This theory says
if r you ,-take away a person’s
motivation for money, there are
other newer things " that will
motivate them. Do they have a
stake in what they are doing? Are
they satisfied? is their job
interesting?

One of the justifications of
people who make so much money is
that money is what_ motivates
people. They say if you can't make
unlimited money they will not be
motivated. 'That medieval theory
has been proven wrong. Many
people can’t ever make $30,000 and
they continue working--just to. live.

We are not_ trying to make
everyone the same. You can't do
that. But everyone has a right to a
fulﬁlling and decent life and this is
not being accomplished by capital-
ism. Most people don’t make over
$30,000 so the emphasis on social
programs will come from corporate
taxes.

Despite unofficial predictions of
the lowest voter turnout since
World War II. Allegheny County
residents will still journey to the
polls tomorrow to ‘choose municipal
andjudicial officials. In addition to
the mayoral “contest". voters will
be faced with the task of selecting
five city councilmen. two Superior
Court judges.’ and ten Common
Pleas Court judges.

An examination of the eandi-.
dates will help distinguish one
name on the ballot from the next.

Local government input is
strongly determined-by the nine
people who sit on the Pittsburgh
City Council. Members fix the city
tax rate and departmental appro-
priations, and must approve the

appointments of city officials. Five

of these seats are due to be filled
tomorrow. and 16 candidates are

jury will remain as a necessary step
in _judicial prosecution. V
After someone is arrested, he

appears before 'a member of the’

minor judiciary, such as a
magistrate or justice of the peace,
to be informed of the charges ﬁled
against him.’ Following this, the
preliminary hearing takes place.

Again a member of the minor
judiciary resides _as both the
prosecution and defense for their
arguments.

The magistrate decides if there" is ,

sufficiei_i_t/ evidence to -justify
holding the accused for further
"court action. If not, charges are
dismissed. ' ~

The indicting grand jury is the
third step in the process of criminal
prosecution. At thislevel, the
prosecution secretly discusses its

Historians claim the grand jury

originated in 12th century England

un.dcr'the reign of King Henry II.

_ At this time, “the good and lawful

men"- in each community identified
local offendes and articulated the
charges they should face before a
traveling judge. This was done to
protect the citizen from the

monarch's unjustprosecution as a .

way of getting political revenge.

The inﬂuence of ‘English juris-

Drop-In Treatment  

BY FELICE NEWMAN

“What else can they treat? If
you say drugs are the problem.
vou‘ll treat the symptoms." This is
dcnet Marincic. She is in the
Special Education and Rehabilita-
tion Department and is working
with Middle Earth. a “drop in"
center for teenagers in Penn Hills.
Jcnet Marincic is speaking of the
de-toxification programs in this
area. “There's got to be an
emotional problem. If you want to
be a junkie you're going to have to
.take drugs all the time."

In Allegheny County there are
twenty-four agencies to help people
with drug problems. Some, like" St.
John's on the Northside, are
strictly de-toxification centers for
hard drug users. Some, like Karma
House, treat the inner problem as
well as the drug problem. Alpha
House, located in Shadyside,

report to teaches the individuals’

how to live, work and exist in the
community. Many hospitals in this
area have centers to treat drug
problems as well as alcohol-related’
problems. .
Marincic stated that these ag-
encies will refer the individual to

' another center if they feel they

can't help.. “I think the major
problem is making people aware of
where they can go." ,

l asked Marincic if she felt the
situation was getting worse. "If
you would have asked me that
three months ago I would have said
‘yes.' But. people are.getting more
aware of the problem."

Marincic said that the success of
these centers “depends upon the
individual--whether he just wants
to get de-toxified, or if he wants
emotional help.” She also said
success depends upon whether the
program will offer vocational and
emotional help.

Ii went over to Karma House to see
what it's all about. ‘Karma House
is located at 262 Bouquet St. From
the street the house does not look
like a drug center. It looks’ like a

responsibility for themselves.

house--a bit too old, delapidated
couch on the porch, high above
street level. A dog barks as l climb
the steps up to the door.

A tall man answered my knock.
We sat down on some carpeted
steps_in the rear of the house and
talked. “We're seeing people with
many different kinds of problems.
Most people we see have drug
problems. We deal with peoples'
real problems. Drugs are only
symptomatic.

“Our program is non-residential.

-The program consists of individual
and group counseling. lf we can't,

help a person we'll.refer him to an
agency that can. .

“Drug problems present them-
selves in different forms. If the
individual’s immediate problem is
withdrawl, we’ll treat him here or
arrange for him to be treated in a
hospital. In the case of barbiturate
addiction,

I asked the man. Irwin Kalson,
what ‘specific drug problems he
sees. “The particular

problems change. At first it was

psychcdelics. Then. it was speed."

Now--downcrs.

"'l wouldn't say things are
improving. Things are changing as
different drugs become popular or
available.

“The real problem we’re treating
is emptiness. People have holes in
them, y’know? Most people,
rather than using the tools they

-have, will fill the. holes up the

easiest way.”

l asked Kalson how.successful
Karma House has been in its
three—year existance. “I think
we've been success-ful--we don't
have any measuring stick. Our

purpose is to facilitate peoples'

Hazerdous‘ conditions in Pitts-
burgh factories have been a major
concern of workers for a number of
years. but not until recently has
something with any consequence
been done about it. The
Occupational Health and Safety Act
(OSHA) was passed on the federal
level in 1970 to protect workers
against these conditions, but to the
disappointment of factory employ-
ees. OSHA is underfunded and
understaffed.

As a resultiof this Act. the
Pittsburgh Area .. Committee on
Occupational ‘Safety and Health
(PACOSH) was formed by a group
of Pittsburgh area union and
non-union workers. An Advisory
Board comprised of Doctors.
Lawyers and Professors, mostly
from Pitt. do research and give
advice to the PACOSH members.
The Advisory Board also ‘helps
bringin guest speakers to alert the

According to PACOSH’s presi-.

zation’s objective is for the workers
to band together and ' educate
themselves on occupational safety

“PACOSH was formed to give the
workers a basic education on

and chemicals in plants, and to aid 

in the teaching of what the OSHA
act can do for the workers.”
Colonello, a union worker for
Union Switch and. Signal .in
Swissvale sees PACOSH‘ as a big
step in the protection of the right
for a worker to have safe working
conditions. “If a worker thinks that
there is a dangerous situation in

 _ BY DAVE MAJERNIK
Amidst controversy in City Hall,
Pittsburgh’s annual Fall Flower
Show began yesterday and will‘ run
for two weeks at North Side's
Allegheny Center Mall.

,'Sev,eral councilmen, including
Richard Caliguri, chairman of the
Parks -and Recreation Committee,
ghavelstrongly opposed Mayor Pete
Flaherty’s plan to move the ﬂower
show from the Phipp’s Conserva-
tory in Oakland to other locations
‘.‘in the neighborhoods.” Last
year’s show was held in City Hall.
"Councilman Caliguri said he
opposed the Mayor's idea because

really reach the neighborhoods as

Flaherty.claims.

“There are extra costs for
duplicating the facilities which the
Conservatory already has," he
said. “Then add to that the
expense of transferring the flowers
to the new location."

Caliguri said the actual cost of last
year’s and this year’s show have
not been made public by the

_Flaherty administration, but he

hoped this information would
become available soon. -
“There are not very many

\ buildings in the neighborhoods big

enough to house the flower show."

Moving to Allegheny Center Mall,
he said.‘ is not exactly moving to the
neighborhoods anyway.

Caliguri said he was in favor of
putting ,on “teaser shows" in
various neighborhood locations to
advertise what is in the flower
show.

“lfit's hard to get to Oakland. it's
hard to get to Allegheny Center.
I'd rather spend the money (used‘
for transporting the show to
Allegheny Center) to provide buses
from downtown to Oakland," ‘he
said. . 1

He explained that when the show

I is held .at the Oakland conserva-
-tory, visitors can also view the

permanent exhibits there.

“Certainly Allegheny Center will
look beautiful during the show, but
at the Conservatory. you feel like
you're in an atmosphere of
flowers." he said.

“The Conservatory is in a setting
where people can spend a day. But
last year. when the show was held
in City Hall. it took about ten
minutes to see the whole thing.

worked closely with the Chamber of

. Brown also disagreed with Cali-
guri about the expense.

“This year’s show is not any more
expensive,” she said. “It’s just a
matter of transporting the ﬂowers

used facilities and people from the

“When the ‘show was held

She admitted she didlnot know the

Brown said ﬂower show visitors
can also shop at the stores in the
mall or visit nearby A cultural

Colonello said that, “Companies

we propose that they also be given
when they leave, so that it can be
determined if their health has been

Most of the physical examina-
tions ‘and’ treatments given. to the
workers are done by company
doctors, which Colonello feels
serve the company and not the
worker. From this assumption, he
proposes that if a worker is not
satisfied with the treatment of a

company doctor, that he sould be .

able’ to go to a doctor of his choice,
with the companyibearing the cost.
Colonello also said that many
chemicals used in the factory
today, have not been proven safe.

' He feels that ‘thepworker is a guinea

pig, "being exposed to these_un-safe
chemicals. In a speech given this
vear. he said, “Each year at least

600 new chemicals are introduced
into the U.S. workplaces. Also at
least 16,000 potentially dangerous
substances \ now in use in the
workplaces have been indentiﬁed,
although “safe" standards have
been set for only a few hundred."
PACOSH has taken the
initiative to inform workiers of the
dangerous chemicals, and how..they\
can be safely used.  1

PACOSH meetings and lectures
are open to the public, and since
they are held at the Graduate
School of Public Health at Pitt,
Colonello urges Pitt students to

BY MICHELLE PILECKI

When folk music started, all you
needed was a guitar and some
gutsy lyrics that sort of made
sense. Folk music was the song of
the times.

And with the times. folk has
become sophisticated. Its not all
the scratchy stuff of an old

haystack; there's melody and
poetry. At least. that's the way it
comes out on Ross Ryan's A Poem
You Can Keep (EMI). a collection

of poetry on music, the likes of
which haven't been seen since Paul
Sinion’s early days.

Born in Kansas but raised in

Australia. Ross writes and sings of

the artist as a young lover (which
may or may not be himself).
wounded in love but still searching.
“Worth My While," which he
describes as “a sort of noncom-
mital love song," asks the
questions of a hesitant seducer.
still protective of his fragile ego.

The metaphorcs of gardens and
flowers in this touching test of
fealty disguises the more earth
pleasures in mind.

"Empire Lady" portrays a mys-
terious woman almost as sorrowful
as the singer himself. in a pleading
voice urged on by spiraling
instrumentation to an emotion-
laden crescendo. The lead song. “I
Don't Want to Know About It,"
characterized by some strong.
insistent vocals. eloquently pleads
the case of the young man just too
hurt in love to dare try again.

Some people are sad and just
miserable, but Ross Ryan seems to
be one of those rare persons who
transforms personal tragedy [if it
is] to a rare beauty. Named
Australia’s “Best New Talent,”
and his album “Record of the
Year” there, Ross has still
maintained a sense of humor, as
exemplified by “Can’t Say It Hurts
Me.” It has the sad, emotional
lyrics of his other songs, but set to
a lively, almost country, melody,
made even more ridiculous by
some playful sound effects from the
studio.

A Poem You Can Keep, just
released in the States, is filled
with songs that, sentimentally,
may be called “touching,” or
“romantic“ or even “beautiful."

But. without sentimentality. it
touchingly tells the story of a young
romantic with some frankly beauti-
fully chosen words. The pain and
longing in‘ the songs are often
reminiscent of a young Kris
Kristofferson (who the 23-year-old
Ryan physically resembles. al-
though he sounds like an Irish
tenor). If you dig words. dig into
these.

Speaking of Irish tenors, there are
some real ones bursting into the
scene. Horslips is an Irish folk-rock
group combining traditional Gaelic
folk music with the harder beat of
American rock, to come up with a
very different LP, Happy To
Mcet...Sorry To Part [Atco].

The Irish quintet. well educated
and well versed in Irish traditional
music. blends the bouncing Gaelic
with the harder rock, forming a
hybrid of fragile melodies squared
against heavy electric beats. as in
“Hall of Mirrors.“ Sometimes the
lively spirit of the Irish prevails.
to bring the light and wispy Gaelic
doing a jig to the‘ modern rock. as
on “Dance To Yer Daddy" or “An
Bratack Ban" (sung in Gaelic).

A quiet moment can be found in
the wistful “The Shamrock Shore,”
lightly picked up by “Flower
Among Them All.” Probably the
liveliest song on the album is an

, ‘Johnny Majors paced the sidelines restlessly for most of Saturday's

the Panthers had a comfortable lead- They could not however, bust it

said Majors. _ .

easy game. “You can only make a game easy by wearing down the

team in the first half. and then they will be demoralized enough in ‘the
second that you may be able to run all over them.‘

Pitt has been able to wear teams down. It has not been able to wear

, ﬂdown underdogs. Schools like Georgia and Tulane were whittled down
i to Pitt's level. Pitt has a problem getting up for games in which it is the

favorite’. especially home games. ‘

“We weren’t ready in the mind,” said freshman defensive tackle

A -Don Parrish.

“We haven't really been up the last three weeks." said center Mike
Carey. "It's easier to get up when we're underdogs."

This may partially explain Pitt's curious home-away record. The
Panther's were underdogs in every road game except the Boston
College game. and did not lose any of them. Apparently. a hostile
crowd ‘contributes to the emotional mood of the Cats.

A loud home crowd should serve the same purpose, but Pitt Stadium

7, fans have not been cheering madly throughout the ‘game. Only after a

big play is loud applause heard.

All of this should make this Saturday's Notre Datne game very
interesting. Pitt will be a heavy underdog. and half of the people in the
Majors‘ troops may
just begin to think that it‘s an away game.

POOR OFFICIATING
The officiating inSatut'da_v's game was atrocious. It had nothing to
do with the outcome. but it did cause the fight that erupted in the third

quarter. and it could have led to serious injury. I

The strategy of several of the sicker members of the Syracuse team
was to get Dorsett out of the game at any cost. The officials did not call
one latc hit. although there were many. and things climaxcd in that
third quarter skirmish. in which punches were thrown. '

“They were trying to break Tony’s [Dorsett] leg,” said tackle Dave
Wannstedt.

"They were twisting his knee." explained Billy Daniels.

“Yea, they were trying to break my leg,” admitted Dorsett.

“They were scratching Billy's eyes out too." said Carey.

"I'm very concerned about this situation." said Majors. "I have
never seen as much late hitting before. and it's not being called. I have
spoken to this supervisor of ECAC officials."

Dorsett was certainly not intimidated. His 211 yards rushing gives

. him 1139 for the season. a Pitt record.

Going into the game. Ben Schwart7.walder and his Orangemen

, ‘seemed to deserve pity for their 0-7 record. After watching what was

being done to Dorsett. the 0-8 record seems appropriate." 0-ll could
not come close to twhatjthey deserve. and 0-11 is probably what they
will get. '

total of 577. set against the 1929
Duke team. They missed by 13
yards the 1929 record of 468
rushing yards. The rather modest
win streak itself is the best since
1363.

Surprisingly. the Orangemen
marched 66 yards after an
exchange of punts to open the
scoring. Sophomore quarterback
Bob Mitch engineered the drive in
13 pla_vs. throwing 43 yards to
tailback Bob Bartlette to the Pitt
seven. Three plays later. fullback
Phil Raleigh took it in from _the two.

Bernie‘ Ruoff converted the kick
and the lead was 7-0.

But the Pitt offense had"yet to hit

gear. When they did, it was -a

« matter-oftime. Daniels guided the

Cats to four long driving scroes on
the afternoon--drives of 90, 76, 82,
and 80--two in each half. After the
Orange score, the Panthers struck
for two ,TD’s wrapped around a 36
yard missed field goal _by Carson
Long to lead by seven at the half._

It took Daniels 13 plays to tie the

‘score. From his ten. he hit ﬂanker ,

i The Cats took the lead a short
time later as Daniels circled right

- up by a Mike‘Bulino interception at

the Pitt 24. D.orsett’s 40 yarder was
the key play of the drive.
Fullback Dave Janasek, scored
his first TD of the year in the third

The Pitt soccer team kept its
hopes alive for a winning season
last Saturday as the booters shut
much-outplayed Gannon
team. With‘ only two- games
remaining in the Panthers’ sche-
dule. the Cats cannot afford to lose
any games or else they will end up
with a losing record.

The Pitt team was able to contain
the Gannon squad in their half of
the field. which is an accomplish-
ment. but turned out to be a slight
problem because_ it is very hard -to
score on a team when they are all
down in their zone trying to clear
the ball out. — I

"We did much better when we
brought the ball up from our
zone." said Coach.Bemis. “Be-
cause we didn't have to worry
abourtheir entire team waiting for
‘us in front of the goal."

Gannon sported a team made up
of mostly foreigners.from Jamaica,
Israel, and Italy, and even though
they lmew how to handle the ball
well, the game was completely
dominated by the Pitt team. .

Bill Haines picked up his fourth
shutout of the season to add to his
record of career shutouts for a Pitt
goalie and Joe Luxbacher added

, two more goals to his lead in career

scoring for the Panthers.
Luxbacher
John Morhan goal. giving Morhan
three goals in the past three
games. while Nick Chrisanthom
also picked up a goal on one of Bill
Rex's two assists of the game.
Rex’s second assist was a corner
kick which Alan Jutca placed into
the goal. with a nice head shot.
The Panthers had previous
trouble scoring on the corner kicks
but lately have been able to

When Dorsett dropped the ball on
the way to an apparent 77‘ yard
touchdown. sportscaster Myron
Cope quipped. “Why he runs
faster than the ball." That’s no
baloney. Myron....Dorsett explain-
ed that he was switchingithe ball to
his other hand,when it squirted

score on the last play of the game.
Majors had this to say: “I don't
believe in it (running up the score)
and I'm not going to do it." The
Panthers should have had some
sympathetic opponents like that in t
the last decade.

Gannon  

capitalize on the charity kicks.

Pitt's next two games are against ,

a very physical Indiana team and

Penn State who has only lost one i"

game this season. that loss being to
West Virginia. who defeated the
Cats by a score of 2-1 earlier in the
season. - '

I “I think we have a good chance
to beat Indiana and the team is
really psyched for the game with
Penn State.” said Coach Bemis._
“and since we are already outof
the running for the Western Penn
championship. we want to get the
winning ‘season at least."

The chances against Indiana are
pretty good. but the Panthers will
need a little luck to beat Penn State
under the lights. a'team that is
consistently rated as one of the best
in the East. but as we all.know. in
sports anything can happen.

in nine times this season.
Dorsett isn't worried how the
points get up on the scoreboard. as
long as they get up there.
“Disappointed? No. I .did my
day’sjob and that’s what counts,”
Dorsett remarked. ,
There were two plays where
“T.D.." could have had six points,
but on one run when he danced into

The running combination of

Pitt offense and Dorsett likes to see

as much as Billy likes to run it ‘
himself. That doesn’t mean that

‘Tony is getting tired of lugging the
