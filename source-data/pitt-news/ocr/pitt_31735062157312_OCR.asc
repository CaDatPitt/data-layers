Parking Investigation Committe -

A student parking committee. to ‘ investigate problems
faced by Pitt commuters has been promised by Student Con-

gress president, Ross Reese.
. The committee will make

a study of the parking situa-

tionin Schenley plaza to see What can be done.

Protest Letters Sent to City °
Last May,’ letters of protest
were sent to the city when Car-
negie Library oﬁicials demanded
parking meters to‘ keep students
from parking along the Library
side of the plaza.
‘ Traﬂic engineer Michael J. Git-

tens claims that no one from the
University ever contacted him

concerning Schenley plaza. He did
reveal, however, that council in-
structed him to investigate. The
result of the alleged protests and
the. traﬂicr department’s investiga-
tion showed that 32 parking spots
were made into one-hour parking
spots. .
Parking Meter Gag Was Screen
Reese said that the “parking

.-

meter gag” was merely a “screen”
by city engineers to pass the one-
hour signs and get away with it.

Mr. Gittens suggested “more
off street parking” as a possible
solution.» ' A '

Safety director George Fairly
said that a giant underground
parking lot will "relieve all of the
Oakland parking problems. A

Private. Owner Lowers Rates

A private parking lot owner,
John Katsur, said that lots near
the University will lower their

rates for studentswho park stead-
ily in. their lots, 1

Meanwhile, SC and Reese ‘at
Monday's meeting failed to get
around to the business of discuss-

ing the formation of the. parking,

with the help of students, will
form a huge blue and gold “P” in
the cheering section. ' .
This venture failed last Satur
day at the Oklahoma game be-
cause of warm weather, poor- stu-
dent cooperation, and lack of or-
ganization.
Capes For Students
The sameiblue and gold capes
‘will be handed out tomorrow to
‘all students sitting in a seat mark-
ed with the letter “P” on. the
wooden edge," These _students will
be expected; to wear"the capes,
which hav,e,.'blue backs and yel-,_

The cheering section will "be
converted *into an oversize golden.
“P.” which‘ will turn blue when
the cheerleaders signal: the stu-
dents on the public address sys-
tem. to stand and “about f_ace.”2
Another possible maneuver. is to
have'_each row turn by itself "to
give" a rippling effect to the
change of colors. 4 _ _ -
.Many more elaborate schemes
have been worked out and exe-
cuted" in previous years‘. Once a

made which featured, the hammer
moving and hitting the anvil.. At
another game, the shape of a foot-
ball soaring over the goal post
was outlined by the cape-wearing
students as. an incentive to the
Pitt team. .

Question Box Comes Up

VVith Unique Questions

By JIMZ DeWEESE

There are 42 floors in the Cathedral of Learning. Ap-
proximately 1/5 of the way up, on the eighth ﬂoor, stands

a box.

A clot in the top and a lock on the side are the only
distinguishing features of this box. From time to time stu-

dents place‘ slips of paper in theé

slot. The box acepts these papers
and, at regular intervals, disgorges
them into the’ hands of a member
of the Pitt Independent Associa-
tion. ‘ _ '
Write Your Questions

On the upper left hand corner
of the box stands a card which
states: “This is a question box.
Write your questions concerning
Pitt on a slip of ‘paper and deposit
it in the slot. Answers will be
posted on the bulletin board.”

V The box takes its job serious-
ly but; on occasion, it has re-
ceived slips which would wring

a. chuckle from even a six sided
slab of slate. _

One slip quiered, “Where are all

the -girls?” Another protested that,
“a foul has been committed by
the sophomores in the tug-of-war
since they had ﬁve more men than
the freshman ha_d.” Still another,
as an aftermath of the ‘Greek
Sing” asked’ innocently, “Do ‘the
Sigma Chis really drink milk?’.’
A ‘Serious Side ‘

,Some of the‘ questions run
along a more serious vein. 7‘On
what ﬂoor is the American Room?
Why is it not talked about as
much as the other Nationality
Rooms?” “What are the class of-
ﬁcers doing for this University?”
And “Why isn’t the ‘P’ at the sta-
dium painted?”

' The box feels the glow of a
job . well done when it gets a
chance to I answer a. serious
question such as, “When do
baseball tryouts start and what
chance does a. freshman ‘have
to make the team?”

Questions such as, “Where may
one obtain a football schedule of
Pitt’s games?” are very uplifting
to the box and it always straight-
ens its hincts when it receives a

question like, “Who sells freshman .

ties? ” -._
Swallows Everything

One slip of paper contained the
neatly penciled query—-“What is

supposed to be the purpose of this _
institution? It is much morecon- _

fusing than educational. I am not
a freshman.” The box

choice. It must swallow every-
thing and reject nothing- , I

Welcome Home

Every year at this time, along about red ﬂannel weather,
the old grads_come back for Alumni Day. Some have put
on a few pounds, others-puff a bit as they trudge up the
hill to the stadium, but they all have one thing in common
——they’re a littledwary when anyone welcomes them. '

"You can’t blame the old boys, either. They’ve‘ been made
the butt of so-called humor, and pictured as a group of
senile old men who mumble to each other about the great-

‘ ness of teams in the past or how times have changed since

they went to school. It’s no wonder they look ,,sharp when
anyone says “Welcome back.” The “welcome” can mean
anything from a sarcastic remark to a buttering up for con-
tributions. » ,

‘Others can make the alumni feel just as insecure by
mouthing maudlin sentiments and shedding tears in their
beers for the alumni of yesteryear. " " '

If this is the only way to welcome the alumni then
we want no part of it, ‘but if we can say in all sincerity,
“Welcome, friends, some day we may be one of you” then:
we have achieved our goal. Then the alumni. will feel as
young and as much a part of the University as the students
who stop at the" entrance to the Commons Room and read
the inscription, “Here is’ Eternal Youth. For You the Very
Stars Are Young.”

Tartan P

y Tim‘ Kovor

Techs.

Some Scotchman or bunch of Scotchmen devised‘

a plan to smuggle another Scotchman into Cathedral
last week disguised as one'of our freshman.. The
object of their unprecedented intrusion was to ob-
tain material for a story in the Carnegie Teck
Tarten. The author of the article, who. used the
pseudonym of Matthew John, actually attended
classes at Pitt and even had his
picture taken seated in one of the’ 
Due to the usual 
confusion that sometimes forces
students to attend late registra- ,
tion and enter classes for which 
they are not registered, our "plaid '
hero stumbled blindly through
a day’s classes without being dis-
covered as a foreigner.

It might be well to add that  = i 
the youngster from across the Gulch Wrote up his

experiences in a really interesting manner and. in-

Fuss, Vince’ Leonard,‘Pat ’

 

cluded some of his observations on Pitt life. As
we said, the article appeared in the monthly issue
of the Tertan, which, we understand, is the Car-
negie Teck magazine. Many of his observations
were slightly colored by. his experiences encoun-
tered during previous servitude at Tecke (or is it
Teche?).
Plotters Confused _
Nevertheless, his writing shows promise and we
have no doubt that he will someday be employed
on a real. newspaper somewhere, someday, some-
time, somehow. But toget back to the article, the
poor misinformed creature and those unfortunate
Scotchmen who supplied him with the information

and training (required to enable him to pose as '

a student) labored under the impression that we

apprehended and mis-used the escapees who man-
aged to ﬁndtheir way over here. In fact, a vial
of hemlock was supplied the lad in case he should
be discovered and returned to the wretched hovel
from whence he came. The poison was to make
sure he would not suffer the tortures of being taken
back and exposed to the horrible (shudder) and
nerve-wracking (shudder No. 2!) cater- wallings
of the bag-pipers, a standard form of punishment
for deserters. ' _

_But obviously, the-mis-Placed Scotchman enjoy-
ed" life at Pitt so much that he allowed himself to
be rushed by one of our fraternities. The article
ended here but the editors of the Tek Tartar prom-
ised that they rest of the true episode wouldibe
published when the writer catches his breath, and
looks up some more words in the dictionary.

They Actually Did It

Now, this column may have sounded rather fan- .

tastic and/or ridiculous, but the truth of the mat-
ter is that the Tech Tartan (real spelling) actu-
ally did have a man running ‘around. the Delt_s.-
His article appeared in the issue of the Tartan with
the caption: “I Was a Pitt Freshman _For CIT.”
The second article is slated for publication in the.
next issue. We have the story in the News ofﬁce
for anyone" that wants to read it,_but don’t let any

of those Scotchman (‘theyjhate that word) from -the '
Tartan know that you were interestedin -their little '

coup. , . 4 _
We’re a little sore at them for stealing one of
our ideas. We were going to disguise a volunteer
(highest bidder) -as a girl-and send him ‘over to
PCW to see how the other half lives. Now "the
Tartan has beaten us to the punch and ruined our
project. Maybe 'we’ll challenge them to a duel, to
settle this matter on the ﬁeld of, honor. I

Pitt News:

Mr. DeNinno’s column last

pointed out that students are ‘im-

This letter is to reaﬁirm that

To provide a means through
which useful suggestions can be
implemented, Chancellor ‘Fitz-

Ilas Unusual Hobbies

» By JOAN THOMAS
One of the highlights ofthe spring banquet of Pi Delta
Epsilon, journalism honorary, was the presentation of a
hand-lettered and illuminated volume to the widow of the
late Robert X. Graham, former. head of Pitt’s jourynalism

A
V

department. _

This book, which setforth Gra-
ham’s life accomplishments, was
a’ craft of Mr. Coit R. Hoechst,
member of the Public Education
Board. '

Illuminating Hobby

Mr. Hoechst’s avocation is il-
luminating and ‘embellishing let-
tering with water colors nad gold.
He individually lettered each Pitt
and Tech diploma until 1926 when
he could no longer meet the de-
mand of the increasing sizes of
graduating classes.’ However, he
still letters diplomas for Bucknell
University. J '

Mr. Hoechst, a native of Adams
County, where he received his

' early education, received the mas-

ter’s _degree in languages from
Bucknell. In 1915, after attaining
' languages at Schenley High School.
Directs Adult Education
In 1926, Mr. Hoechst was nam-
yed ‘Director of Extension Educa-
tion for adults, the work in which
the doctor’s degree, the professor
taught Germanics and romance
he. is still engaged. (

The, sprightly professor, who
claims that “education continues
throughout life,” has .taught
thousands of illiterate immigrants.
He declares .that there is a cry-
ing need for adult education be-
causeadults make decisions of
responsibility.”

Years‘ ago, the talented Mr.
Hoechst pursued the fascinating
hobby of violin—making. He work-
ed with. European spruce and
maple, until the war barred the
importation of materials. 4 ..

He’s Musical, Too

Mr. Hoechst played the cello for
chamber music at Bucknell, where
he majored in piano and organ.

one time head of a chorus of 40

Phi Delta Kappa, professional ed-
ucational fraternity for 6 years.

‘M r. Roberts?‘
Rated ‘Victory’
By Reviewer

By VINCE LEONARD

Chalk up an impressive vic-
tory for the Playhouse in its
season opener. For the Craft
Avenue aspirants have honor-
ed “Mr. Roberts,” the Broad-
way success of Thomas-Heg-
gen and Joshua Logan, with
capable directing, acting, and
setting. -

As lifeless _as the famed “paint-
ed ship upon a painted ocean“—-
that’s how the U.S. Cargo Ship
AK 601 could be recorded at the
outset of “Roberts.” But the paint-
ed “can” doesn’t_ have stillborn
characters aboard. Instead, it con-
tains a restless, robust, brawling
crew which ironically, must spend

long tedious hours hours scrubbing -

the tub’s surface to a spic and
span luster. They need ‘liberty.
and quick.-
Roberts Wants Leaves

That’s Mr. Roberts’ job. As lia-
ison between crew and skipper,
Roberts. ho_unds the captain for
shore leave for the men, but to no
avail. Only when Roberts con-
cedes to cease writing letters re-A
questing transfer does. the cap-
tain announce liberty over the
realistic loudspeaker. _ I

Roberts deprives himself of his
one great desire, to get into the

now ebbing war. It works on,him..

He starts falling out .with the men
he loves. You can’t blame Roberts,
though. Consumed with a burnin
desire for action, he is.instead fet-
tered to the insipid job of supply
boss of the ship which delivers
“more toothpaste and toilet pa-
per than any other cargo ship in
the Paciﬁc.” _
Scenes and-Players
Frederick Burleigh, toiling -with

» a huge cast, was required to wave

a deft hand of direction to pre-
vent crowded‘ or cumbersome
scenes. He chose his players apt-

ly, too.. The uniform and char-

acter of Lieutenant (jg) Roberts
ﬁts David Walsh as if- both were
tailored-made for him.

Giving Walsh a close run for
top acting laurels is William Ross
cast as Doc. oss portrays the
sagacious sawbones with a com-
fortable, easy-going presence; The
Captain and Ensign Pulver pic-
ture meaty portions of the char-
acterization. Eddie Mack is the
cantankerous captain to a T. Wil-
liam Glennon as the hilarious,
lady-killing ensign comes off suf-
ﬁciently..

Nautical But Nice

The stage itself is all U.S. Navy
Cargo ship. Ladders, hatches,
portholes——all the stock nautical
p_roperties—are adroitly etched by
the crew, too numerous to men-
designer William J. Ryan. '

  ‘Students Should Be More Careful’

Proclamation Wins

B M ' 't   V to
The signing of a “proclamation” placing responsibility
for damages incurred as a result of victory rallies on SC

dents were polled on the question, “Do you thing the Damage
Pact will stop vandalism after games?” i ‘

it’s a good thing because too much

Pitt’s newly formed soccer team
will tackle last year’s undefeated
Grove City eleven next Tuesday
after gaining a 2-2 tie in its ﬁrst
outing against Indiana State

The Indiana State game had no
holds barred and the Blue and
Gold found its ﬁrst intercollegi-
ate competition bitter due to the‘
fact that ofﬁcials suppliedby In-
diana came on the scene ﬁve min-
utes before the game’s end.

Although the _Pitt .bo_oters have
30 men on their roster they took
only 17,-Wand all 17 saw action.
The two Pitt goals were scored in
each half, with - Ed Armstrong.
kicking in the tieing score. Dick
DeTorre, , Pitt’s other offensive
might, scored the ﬁrst goal with
a straight kick right up the mid-
dle. ‘

stantly ‘storming the opposition’_s

frequently nulliﬁed ‘by an _ alert
Indiana goalie. Don. Clark, Pitt’s

Milligan, Glass ford
Return to Alma Matepr

By‘ CARROLL COOK
Nearly all alumni enjoy seeingtheir--' football team win,
especially on Homecoming Day. However, on Saturday, this

will not be the case.

Nebraska coaches Bill Glassford and Mike Milligan come
home tomorrow to the same gridiron where both of them

gained fame as outstanding linemen under the guidance of 

the late Dr. John B. “Jock” Sutherland. Glassford was the

captain
guard in 1936 and led his team
to a 21-0 victory over _Washing—
ton in the Rose Bowl. The other
guard on that team was Steve
Petro, freshman football coach.

A l t h o u gh
Glassford, head
Cornhusker
mentor‘, would
give anything
for a 'win over
his alma mater,
Milligan still
has a personal
score to settle
with Pitt.

When Milli-H
gan resigned as
Pitt coach after
the 1949 season, he ‘left with
a taste of bitterness and in a
sense, he was justiﬁed in his
feelings. In his ﬁnal year as head
coach, Milligan guided the Pan-
thers to a respectable 6-3 record,
which included wins over Penn
State, Penn, West Virginia, and
Northwestern, while one of the
defeats was to Ohio State, winner
of the Rose Bowl six weeks later.
But after that successful season,
Milligan was offered only a one

‘Scoring a_, touchdown in each

F_oo‘tbal1 got under way at windy
Schenley Oval Wednesday. ,

Led by the versatile Bud.Spang-

the Kappa .Nu team, Midway in

‘ the ﬁrst period. Spangler arched a

long’ forward pas-s toward the end

__zone_ which was pulled in by Dick
Snyder for‘ the ﬁrst six pointer.

Kappa Nu then started an offen-
sive drive, but was stopped just
short of ~,pay_dirt'. ‘
. Soon . after, Spangler couldn’t
ﬁnd a_receiver open as he faded
for a, pass, so he dashed around his
own right end to make the half-
timescore read 1‘2-0. " V
Taking the second half kickoff,

' the Sigs intercepted anothar Kappa

Nu pass and drove deep into their
opponents’, territory before ' Tom
Blosserl leaped high into the air to
haul in a basketball pass from
Spangler amidst a mass of reach-
ing arms to hike the score to 18-0.
Content ' with‘ their hard-earned
lead, the Sigs switched" to "a de-
fensive pattern in order to pro-
tect the lead. In the ﬁnal few mo-

On one occasion last season, a
meet with their arch rivals, West
Virginia, the distance men arrived
late in Morgantown and therefore
had no chance to go over the
Mountaineer course. The situation
was so serious that the runners
didn’t know when to pick up
speed or where the ﬁnish line was
located.

As a result, a Mountaineer man
placed ﬁrst, nullifying a possible
Pitt shutout. Even though the 10-
cals -did return victorious, Olson
swore he would never again sub-
ject his boys to a race ‘without
first exploring the foreign track.‘
