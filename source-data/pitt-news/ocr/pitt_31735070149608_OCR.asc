Occupiers celebrate Christmas at Mellon Green

Gwenn Barney
Senior Staff Writer

As children around the world
kept watch for Santa Claus on
Christmas Eve, Occupy Pittsburgh
camper Martino Gruelle held a
vigil of a different sort. Gruelle
served as a guard for the camp

during the night, making sure Oc-
cupy Pittsburgh remained safe
the night before Christmas.

“A lot ofpeople did spend the
holiday with their family, but
someone has to hold down the
camp,” Gruelle said.

On the outside, Mellon Green,
the park privately owned by BNY
Mellon‘ Bank which Occupiers

have settled in and renamed The
People’s Park, bore no signs that
the holiday season had arrived.
No lights or other traditional dec-
orations adorned the more than
40 tents plopped down on the
park’s muddy grounds. For the
Occupiers, the holiday seemed to
mark their community ties more
than the celebration of a religious

holiday. Rather than spend the

‘holiday with those who share

their blood, they chose to spend
the day with those who share
their ideas.

Christmas marked the'near—
end of a turbulent month for the
Occupy Pittsburgh camp. On Dec.

Santorum experienced surge in past weeks  

Iowa 4 1

reported their votes. Romney beat Santorum
by 0.1 percent in the ﬁrst major vote of the
race for the 2012 Republican nomination.

By the end of the night, Romney’s votes
tallied 30,015 (24.6 percent of the ballots
cast), and Santorum
received 30,007 votes
(24.5 percent).

Texas Rep. Ron
Paul, born and raised
in Pittsburgh, came in
third place with 21 per-
cent of the vote, and
former House speaker
Newt Gingrich ﬁnished
in fourth with 13 per-
cent. Texas -Gov. Rick
Perry landed in ﬁfth,
receiving 10 percent of the votes. Minnesota
Rep. Michele Bachmann followed with 5 per-
cent, and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman
came in last with 1 percent.

After the caucuses concluded, Bachmann
dropped out of the race and Perry returned to
Texas to decide if he is going to continue the
ﬁght for the Republican nomination.

After midnight, before the last 2 percent
of votes were tallied and while the race was
still tied, Santorum made his speech at head-
quarters in Johnston, Iowa, thanking the
state for its support.

“You, by standing up and not compro-
mising, by standing up and being bold and

try,” said Santorum, who graduated from
Penn State in 1980, and earned an MBA in
business administration from Pitt in 1981.
In 1986, he graduated from Penn State’s
School of Law. 3
Santorum’s campaign has garnered more
recognition in the past few weeks as he cam-
paigned in all 99 of Iowa’s counties, but his
rank in the national polls has consistently

hovered in the single digits, trailing three
other candidates’. He officially launched his
campaign at the beginning ofjune.

As ofjan. 3, before the caucuses, the Gal-
lup Daily tracking poll for the Republican
presidential nomination listed Romney in
the lead of the GOP ﬁeld at 26 percent. For-
mer House speaker Newt Gingrich was listed
second with 23 percent, followed by Paul at
13 percent. Santorum was at 8 percent.

The Iowa caucuses come only a week be-

The caucuses are the ﬁrst chance a state
has to show support for particular candi-
dates, and they usually set the tone for the

not determine which presidential candidate

nomination. - 

Occupy Pittsburgh faces court date to rule on encampment

Occupy < 1

12, BNY Mellon ﬁled in court to end the
encampment. But Occupiers refused to
leave the park that day, arguing that Mel-
lon Green was built with taxpayers’ money
and belonged to the people.

Ten days later, on Dec. 22, attorneys and
representatives for BNY Mellon met the
Occupiers and their attorneys’ in the Al-
legheny County Court of Common Pleas for
a hearing. At the hearing, Judge Christine
Ward set a trial date forjan. 10 and ruled the
Occupiers could remain in the park until at
least that date. And in this way, a group of 20
Occupiers found themselves protecting the
camp and sharing a meal over Christmas.

Inside the camp’s army—grade meeting

a

tent, Occupy supporter Chris Mason, who
stepped into the role of dinner organiz-
er, stood at a table covered with tinfoil-
wrapped pans. ,.

That’s the way it works at the camp.
When a job needs to be done, someone steps
forward and assumes responsibility. Mason
said camp supporters donated enough food
for a Christmas dinner for 60 people. The
Utility Workers Union of America was the
biggest contributor, donating enough Chi-
nese food for that number.

Packaged and homemade desserts do-
nated by individual supporters lined the
L-shaped dinner table, interspersed with
holiday-themed candles. As Mason sorted
through the food, she rambled off the menu
for the meal: the Chinese food, green bean

casserole, carrots with marmalade, corn
and the crown jewel of the meal — the
roasted ham. But the ham hadn’t arrived
yet. Dinner couldn’t begin until the ham_
arrived. °

Camper Brandon McCafferty missed this
verbal memo. At 3:30 p.m., he charged out
of the army tent wielding a bullhorn.

“Christmas dinner at six o’clock,” he bel-
lowed through his bullhorn to the smatter-
ing of Occupiers and supporters congre-
gated outside the meeting tent.

Mason followed right on his heels. “As
soon as the ham gets here at 4 we’ll eat.
Don’t tell them 6.”

When the ham ﬁnally arrived, the diners
called on Standing Bear White Wolf, a Native
American of the Blackfeet tribe, to bless

them, their meal and theientire camp.
“[Standing Bear] does smudging cer-

' emonies on special occasions: Once a week

on Sunday and on holidays,” said an Oc-
cupier who goes by the moniker T-Bone.
“Today’s Sunday and a holiday, so I guess
it’s a doubly special occasion.”

In one hand, Standing Bear held a me-
dicinal 'mix of tobacco, cedar, sage and
sweet grass, which he.placed in a palm-
sized seashell. He lit the concoction on ﬁre
to release a sweet—scented smoke that he
helped waft around the camp with the aid
of the Red-tailed Hawk feather he held in
his other hand.

“The medicine allows a spiritual cleans-

ing,” Standing Bear explained. “We’re just
giving thanks to the Creator who supports us
from inside and through- public support.”

He moved the smoke in the direction of
the roasted ham, which sat on a table just
inside the meeting tent’s front ﬂap. Stand-
ing Bear proceeded through the entire tent
smudging those who wished for a blessing
on theforehead with his concoction. He ‘
chanted ablessing while hemoved, speaking
about the east, south, west and north, each
direction corresponding to a different stage
of life in Native American lore.

The moment Standing Bear disappeared
through the tent’s rear exit, the sound of a.

trumpet rang clear nearby. About

The Occupiers each ﬁlled a plate with the

a luxury in the camp. 4 _

“We don’t get very much pop down here,”
Occupier Tracie Doyle said between hic-
cups.

They took a seat in their mismatched
chairs of varying colors — some beach
chairs, others lawn chairs or plastic seats
— at the linked plastic tables covered with
a white paper tablecloth and spread with
the packaged desserts. The affair sounded

much like a family gathering as the buzz of

conversation filled the tent.

“I’ve had a lot of bad Christmases,” an
Occupier shared with the table. “This is one
of the better ones.”

But even on a holiday, much of the con-
versation is geared toward the task at hand.
At the far end of the table, Occupiers Ryan
Kelley and Aaron Pollard discussed logistics
for upcoming Occupy events.

As the dinner wound down, discussion

EDITORIAL

Patterson’s decision to

stay merits

For the past two years, many Pitt
students have left for Winter Break
not knowing who next year’s foot-
ball coach would be. And for the
past two years, they’ve endured

a seemingly interminable series"

of rumors and unpleasant sur-
prises.
As every Panther fan now

knows, former head coach Todd

Graham left Pitt for Arizona State
last month. His departure came in
addition to four other defections

that literally halved our coach-

ing staff. In the aftermath of a
singularly turbulent year —— Pitt
launched three coaching searches
in 12 months — our football team
must once again transition to new
management.

Needless to say, we’re disap-
pointed with Graham’s ﬁckleness,
especially given his earlier cham-
pioning of integrity and “the Pitt
way.” His recent interviews — in
which he admitted regret for join-
ing Pitt in the ﬁrst place — only re-
inforced our feeling of betrayal.

But amid the recriminations,
we’d like to acknowledge one man
who has somewhat restored our
faith in Pitt athletics: interim head
coach Keith Patterson. His deci-
sion to stay and, as he said in a
press conference, “ﬁnish what we
started,” merits praise.

The former defensive coordi-
nator wasn’t nearly as vocal as his
friend Graham about “principles,”
but by all counts, he’s adhered to
them far better. Indeed, despite
Patterson’s reputation as the head
coach’s quiet sidekick (the men
roomed together at East Central
University and collaborated for

praise

four years at Tulsa), he’s surpassed
him both in ability ——— Pitt’s defense
excelled this season —— and com-
mitment to the school.

More admirable still, Patter-
son knowingly diminished his job
prospects when he chose to remain
here at Pitt; by the time the BBVA
Compass Bowl concludes, most

colleges’ coaching rosters will be .

full. And although prior connec-
tions will probably help him ﬁnd
employment — Patterson might
still join Graham at Arizona State
— our University has already de-
nied him an extended tenure as
head coach, an opportunity in
which he expressed interest, ac-
cording to ESPN.

Of course, we shouldn’t neglect
mentioning-the other four remain-
ing staff members: quarterbacks
coach Todd Dodge, defensive line
coach Paul Randolph, offensive line
coach Spencer Leftwich and special
teams/linebackers coach Randall
McCray. They, like Patterson, ex-
emplify the respect for tradition
and community many fans still
hold dear.

Regardless of the defectors’ rea-
sons for leaving, we think Patter-
son and his colleagues’ decisions to
remain says more about our athlet-
ic department than the outcome of
the BBVA Compass Bowl. As such,
we hope Pitt fans will meet their
team with enthusiastic applause
this Saturday — not for Graham
and his failed “high-octane” initia-
tives, but for the players’ and the
remaining staff ’s selﬂess devotion
to our school. In the wake of yet
another coaching ﬁasco, they de-
serve at least that much.

How to behave chivalrousl
in the 21st century

Courtney Strauss
Columnist

Ladies, when a man opens the door
for you at Starbucks, thou dost
not protest. Although chivalry is a
practice more often associated with
medieval knights than the modem-
day suitor, it can and should exist
in some modern. form. Though a
man doesn’t need to joust to ‘defend
a lady’s honor or put his coat over
a puddle to pave her way, women
should still expect men to behave
chivalrously.

Men, generally, want to be
chivalrous. It makes them feel like
they’re fulﬁlling their social role to
occasionally grab the check, carry
your armoire up the stairs of your
apartment building or offer up a
seat in a packed lecture hall. Unfor-
tunately, we ladies play a large role
in discouraging these courtesies. If
a man fears a woman will reject his
offer to carry a heavy container or
anticipates a scowl when he offers
his chair, he’s not going to continue
to offer. '

Of course, dynamics between
men and women have changed
enormously since the Middle Ages
—— King Arthur and Lady Guine-
vere we are not. Nevertheless,
singer-songwriter Lyle Lovett’s
love rules still apply..“Women al-
ways go through the door ﬁrst,” he
writes in Esquire. “It’s perhaps an
acknowledgment of women as the
stronger sex. [Men] fo1low.”

We still want your help —' just
don’t be patronizing about it. If I’m
carrying my over-stuffed backpack,
I’m ﬁne — I packed that myself. If
I’m carrying that along with a huge
box of T—shirts for my club’s fund-
raiser, then ask if I need a hand.
You won’t need to walk with me all
the way to my destination -— just
help me get the box up the stairs
or down the hall and then politely
remove yourself from the situation
so you can make it to class on time.
The few minutes of rest you gave my
arms were greatly appreciated, and
my biceps will probably be rejuve-
nated enough for me to transport
the box to the necessary location.

On a related note, always hold

the door for me if I’m a few _steps
away from you. Also, opening the
car door is nice, as is offering your
seat on a bus or subway. (I probably
won’t accept the offer, butiI’ll really
appreciate that you asked.) T
We also appreciate it when you
pay-on dates. Now guys, you should
never pay if it’s your birthday, if

p you’re celebrating a job promotion,
«or during any other “you”—centric

event. But otherwise, an “I’ll get
this one, you get the next one”
practice is appropriate. Women
like to feel as if we were treated to
something and don’t want to deal
with the awkward check-splitting.
Then next time, we can treat you.
Pay on the ﬁrst date, though she
may insist you split it. Assure her
she can get the next one (which also
sets you up for a second date). If you
didn’t have a good time, give in to
her splitting request. If she didn’t
have a good time, she’ll be much
more insistent about offering to
pay her half so she doesn’t feel like
she owes you anything.

It’s also always nice to offer us

WPTS’ DiDonna reﬂects on_20ll music trends

Gabriela DiDonna
For The Pitt News

This year, two giants collide in
something that will rock the Pitt
community.

Or at least give it a taste of some-
thing different in its regular media
intake. Welcome to the new WPTS
column, brought to you by a rotat-
ing cast of the staff of Pittsburgh’s
Progressive FM radio station.

Each week, WPTS will take a
look at musical trends, upcoming
releases or the Pittsburgh music
scene. On the ﬂip side, you can

tune in to the Pitt News on WPTS .

every Thursday at 4:30 p.m. to hear
your favorite Pitt News writers and
columnists take a broadcast look
at the week’s events. '

As the new semester begins, I
wanted to reflect back on the mu-
sical trends of 2011: the good, the
bad and the un—1istenable.

Dubstep: Frankly put, it’s ev-
erywhere. Characterized by a
wobbly bass noise ~—— affection-
ately referred to as “womp” in the
WPTS offices — the genre gained
popularity in Britain in 2005 be-
fore making the leap across the At-
lantic three years ago. In the United

MOVIE REVIEW V

States, dubstep morphed into an
electro-house hybrid, led primarily
by the now—Grammy-nominated
Skrillex. Has the Dayglow tour ac-
tually inﬁltrated the mainstream
to this extent?

Evidently so. In the more electro
vein, Steve Aoki and Pretty Lights

recently played to huge crowds in" “

Pittsburgh, and newcomer Avicii
has a sold—out gig at Stage AE on
Jan. 8.

Saxwave: Deerhunter brought
back the saxophone on their
memorable 2010 album Halcyon
Digest, leading frontman Bradford
Cox to remark, “Next year every-
one’s gonna have a saxophone on
their record because saxophones
are just cool.”

Apparently, he was right. M8:3’s '

monstrous single “Midnight City,”
from the album Hurry Up, We’re
Dreaming, with its electronic riff,
hushed vocals and wailing saxo-
phone hook undeniably became
the favorite song of many WPTS
staffers. It’s now even playing in a
Victoria’s Secret commercial.
Other indie groups worked
in the sax: Destroyer’s “Kaputt”
used it for a pleasant, yacht-‘rock
vibe, while dance-punk’s The
Rapture added a sax“solo to the

breakdown of the blistering “How
Deep Is Your Love.” On the other
end of the spectrum, Katy Perry
fell prey to the power-sax solo on

_ “Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.).” And

one can’t forget Lady Gaga’s ubiq-
uitous “T.he.Edge of Glory” that
featured legendary sax player Clar-

anEe*e1éiﬁ6hs ‘onthe lastlvriéﬁcordihg S l
' of his long career. S

The changing face of indepen-
dent hip—hop: In 2011, we saw
the rise and fall of L.A. rap crew
Odd Future. It started with their
zany TV debut on Jimmy Fallon
in February, continued through
their subsequent popularity in the
springtime and ended with their
acceptance by mainstream media
outlets like MTV and Spin maga-
zine. In short, the self-purported
iconoclasts became everything
they railed against.

At a certain point during the .

summer, we all kind of stopped car-
ing about Odd Future. Maybe it was
because Tyler’s album Goblin, the
ﬁrst major-label release of any of

, the OFWGKTA members,.turned

out to be disappointing in light of
the hype. Or maybe it was because

we all got sick of his rape jokes.

Either way, OF’s been on a slow
decline since the summer.

‘Tattoo’ promising trilogy start

Patrick Wagner
Staﬁ‘ Writer

“The Girl With the Dragon Tat-
too”

Staring: Daniel Craig, Rooney
Mara, Christopher Plummer
Directed by David Fincher
Grade: A

Saturated in equal parts ivory snow,
ultra—violent blood and treacherous
mystery, “The Girl With the Dragon
Tattoo” transports Sweden’s most
notorious thriller to American
screens with just as much style and
substance as the Nordic original.

Based on the ﬁrst volume of au-
thor Stieg Larsson’s “Millennium
Trilogy,” the ﬁlm follows disgraced
journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel
Craig) as he seeks to uncover the
truth about industrialist Henrik
Vanger’s (Christopher Plummer)
long—missing niece in the secluded
north of Sweden. With the assis-
tance of the ever-so-slightly psy-
chotic researcher Lisbeth Salander
(Rooney Mara), Blomkvist uncov-
ers a history of sadism in the Vanger
clan that unravels much more than
just what happened to a child 40
years before.
The visual style immerses the
viewer in Sweden, bringing Scandi-

navia to high-contrast life without
copying the artistic power of the
previous version made for Swed-
ish television in 2009. Fincher has
proved himself to be a master of
the modern thriller with successes

from “Panic Room” to “The Social T

Network,” and it’s no surprise that
some key personnel from the latter
reappear.

phy and Trent Reznor and Atticus

‘Tattoo’ > 8

And while Tyler, Earl Sweat-
shirt, Hodgy Beats and crew domi-
nated the rap scene for the ﬁrst
half of the year, a plethora of rap-
pers and producers have come out
of the woodwork to achieve new
fame: AraabMuzik, Shabazz,Pal-

aces, A$AP Rocky, Danny Brown,
theweeknd, Mr. Muthaf**kin’ eX-

quire and —v my personal favorite
— Azealia Banks.

On her single “212 (feat. Lazy
Jay),” the unsigned 20-year-old
New York rapper works through
a variety of rap personas over an
infectious Diplo-esque beat, bring-
ing to mind shades of Nicki Minaj
and Missy Elliott with her vocals.

While her verses are certainly
dirty —— the parting punchline is
in no way printable here — Banks
wields her sexuality as a political
and social tool in a way that packs
more punch than Nicki Minaj’s
recent tunes. Her lyrical prowess
stands in direct contrast to the ex-

plicitness utilized by rappers such .

as the members of Odd Future, who
seem more bent on shocking than
expressing any real meaning be-
hind their lyrics.

Tesfaye — better known as The

Eat healthy on budget
' ' -By Kirstin Kennedy ’ '
I STAFFWRITER

When you are on a time and money budget during the school year, _
Chipotle and Dunkin Donuts might seem_like the best pit stopfor you

. to re-energize, and We all know that one meal at Panera can shoot
youway past the 10—buck range, and anything off the dollar menu
will make you feel sick. And, of course, you don’t have time to venture
out of Oakland, hunting for a snack. Instead, try these ﬁve inexpen-
sive recipes to satisfy your hunger. They are guaranteed to give you a
healthy boost, they are far cheaper than going out to eat, and you can
reuse almost all of the other ingredients throughout the week. Did I
mention that they are beyond easy, too?

Fettuccine Alfredo

 

Cook the fettuccine according to the package instructions. Person-
ally, I keep the noodles in the water for an extra 2 minutes. Over me-
dium heat, combine the heavy whipping cream, margarine, salt and
pepper, and bring to a boil. Stir this over the heat until it thickens,
about ﬁve minutes. Pour the sauce over the fettuccine, toss in the
Parmesan cheese and sprinkle with parsley.

This pasta dish is surprisingly easy. It also keeps, so eat it for lunch,
dinner or a snack when you know you need a bit of energy.

Odd Future Records

Grade: B

Rocks Like: A futuristic Erykah
Badu

Odd Future’s catapult to fame has ”

included some seemingly out-o’f—
place components.

For one, there is the uncharac-
teristically calm and smooth Frank
Ocean as well as the se1dom—heard—

. of project, “Jet Age of Tomorrow.”

Then there’s The Internet, a

group consisting of Odd Future

sound engineer Syd tha Kid and '

Jet Age of Tomorrow producer Matt
Martian. The two — who also live

together — combine soulful R&B
vocals provided by. Syd tha Kid with
spacey, ambient production from
Martian. ,   I
Perhaps Odd Future’s oddest
pairing, the Internet manages to
ﬁnd a perfect balance between the
grand, multi-instrument produc-
tion from Martian and the soft,

fp _low-key vocals of Syd.

The ﬁrst single from the album,
“Love song -1,” features Syd’s soft
vocals lamenting the loss of a
former lover. Martian’s Outkast-
inspiredproduction complements

-the subtleties of Syd’s"voice per-
fectly on “Cocaine,” a song that
describes just what the title sug-
gests. While there are plenty of
moments in which the duo ﬁnd a
perfect balance on this record, the
production on songs like “Gurl”
feels a bit overwhelming despite the

lyrical sentiments being perhaps
the most potent.

Odd Future ringleader Tyler, the
Creator, rants, “Listen closely to the
music before you put it in a box,”_

‘ at the end of the original version

of “Sandwiches.” The Internet is a
prime example of what he meant.

Much of the album is concerned
with the personal experiences of
the two performers, but this isn’t
a typical R&B record. Odd Future
affiliate Mike G.shows up on the
song “Lincoln,” a funk—inspired
song about Mike G’s favorite topic:
weed. Then there’s “She Knows,” a
meditation on-Syd coming out of
the closet to her parents. In many
ways, The Internet is a perfect ﬁt
for the newly founded Odd Future
Records. Its music is just as unclas-
siﬁable as everything else in the
group’s canon. I

Echoes of Silence

The Weeknd '

Self-Released

Grade: A-

Rocks Like: The best part of a trilogy

The fact  Echoes of Silence — the third
EP by Toronto-based R&B performer The

Weeknd —— starts with a cover of Michael
Jackson’s “Dirty Diana” serves as a tes-
tament to the Internet age’s celebrity-
making potential. '

The group’s first EP, House of Balloons,

released less than a year ago, began with .

the track “High for This,” a song that fea-
tures singer Abel Tesfaye coaxing a would-
be lady of the night into a one—night stand.
Echoes’ ﬁrst track is a complete turnaround
from this —— as if somewhere in between
House of Balloons and this record the
group reached a level of stardom rivaled
only by that of the late King of Pop.

This shoot to fame is chronicled

0 throughout the album. Tesfaye’s signa-

ture high-pitched croon sets off the track

“Montreal,” a ballad detailing a girl who-
lost her chance to be with the now—famous ~

narrator. Tesfaye sings, “You just want me
cause I’m next,” on the chorus of “Next,”
a song lamenting the prevalence of fame-
seeking girls at shows and clubs.

Despite the newly found stardom, the
sound of The Weeknd remains relatively
characteristic, relying significantly on
druggy, synth-heavy production reminis-
cent of its breakout mix tape. Producer
Clams Casino lends his hand forthe song
“The Fall,” adding his trademark ambience
to the already moody track.

   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

ed artist shows promise

In alot ofways, The Weeknd’s struggles
with newly acquired fame area symptom
of the Information Age. The Toronto-

‘based group went from posting songs on

its blog to being featured on Drake’s Take
Care album in roughly a year.

The most" interesting element of this
EP is-the fact that the narrator never takes
a particularly high road morally. Tesfaye
laments of the excess and the ease with
which sex comes with fame but always
seems to fall into the same patterns.
There’s a sense that even though most
of this record’s listeners will never live

ments are still relatable I

losses to Wagner, NotreDame

basketball team (11—4, 0-2 Big

against the No. 1 team in the

“We learned today that you
can’t give up and that we’re still

sophomore forward Donnavan
Kirk said after the loss. “Trust
me — our heads are not going to

The Blue Demons are one

i ‘ of the highest scoring teams igl

Jeremiah Kelly also pose a scoring
threat for DePaul, averaging

Despite Pitt’s recent struggles,
history will be on the Panthers
side on Thursday night.

Since DePaul joined the Big
East in 2005, the Blue Demons
have lost all seven match—ups with
Jamie Dixon’s Panthers.

“We’re just going out there,

But the truth is that a worst- 
case scenario situation still
seems to leave the Panthers in the
NCAA Tournament, even if they
are a bubble team. And anyone
who knows anything about
college basketball will tell you
that there’s only one month that
counts; March. a _ - T’ 

‘So what,reaso‘n is thereto -T, 
hfgld hope? Why shouldn’t fans
give up on the Panther basketball
team like they gave up on the Pitt
football team?

I’ll give you four: A

This isn’t football

A In college sports, you have
two big money makers: football
and basketball. Some schools get
great programs in both. Most _
have enough trouble excelling in
one. _ — ,

A#_,At Pitt, a storied football
p‘r”‘ogram matches a primetime
basketball program.

Unfortunately, the Pitt
administratAion’s best attempts
at finding a football coach to
replace Dave Wannstedthave led
to three coaching searches in less
than a year.

I don’t blame Panther fans
for turning their backs on the
football team. But a loss to
Wagner and a loss to Long Beach
Stage isn’t enough for people to
start hopping off the basketball
bandwagon, too.

This isn’t football. Two bad
losses doesn’t mean the season is
over. In fact, threestraight losses
isn’t muchmore than a scrape on
the knee.

-The veterans

When you think of Pitt
basketball, you think of four— V
year stars, guys thatjamie Dixon
has forged a strong enough
rglationship with to keep around
for their entire eligibility.

Brandin Knight, Brad
Wanamaker and Sam Young come
to mind. These are the kind of
guys that make decisions like
Birch’s so unacceptable in the

Blue and Gold nation. _

Well, I’ve got a news ﬂash for

you: Despite its youth, the 2011-

2012 edition of the Pitt basketball

team has these guys.

Ashton Gibbs, Nasir Robinson AA

and Travon Woodall have all
left their markA on this program.

A And in their ﬁnal campaign this A

season, I can guarantee they’re
going to do everything in their
power to take “the Pitt basketball
team somewhere it’s never been.
Gibbs is the school’s most proliﬁc
scorer. Woodall is a pure point
guard with scoring ability. A .
Robinson excels inside, scoring A
with contact and in contortions

A that seldom seem reasonable.

When Woodall returns from A
his injury, the Panthers will geta

much—needed boost offensively as .
Woodall creates open shots with

faith in those guys. As Gibbs - T '
said after Pitt’s third consecutive
loss to Cincinnati, “At the endyof A
the day, this team is capable of
beating anybody.” And I believe

It should also be noted that

they still made it to the second

Even with three tough losses

Wagner and Cincinnati, the Pete

is still one of the toughest places i
