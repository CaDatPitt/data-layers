Theatre
Presents

“Godot”

The University Theater will
present Samuel Beckett’s classic
of the modern theatre, Waiting
for Godot this weekend and next.
Godot will be the last major pro-
duction of the school year.

Dr. Bert States’ directs this pro-
duction, which features Jeffrey
Embler as Estragon, Jeffrey Hart
as Vladimir, James Berry as

1* Lucky, Harvey Miller as" Pozzo,
and Marcia Godich as the mes-
senger. ‘Phillip Eck is set design-
er and Constance Hipwell will
manage costumes.

.Godot does not tell a story; it
explores a static situation. Its
subject is not Godot but “wait-

- ing” —— the act of waiting as an
essential ' and characteristic as-
pect of the’, human condition.
Two tramps live in hope: they
wait for Godot whose coming
‘ will bring peace and permanance.
Once he arrives‘, they will no
longer be homeless ‘Wanderers;
they will have arrived home.

The very act of waiting pre-
vents them from recognizing the.
absurdity of their situation and
serves as an -escape; the suffer-
ing of being is replaced by. the
boredom. of living. Godot under-

‘scores the inadequacy. of the ra-

tional approach to A life. Beckett
frequently resorts to the blatant
and open abandonment of ra-
tional devices and discursive

Tthought. , .

By so affronting rational man,
Absurdists such as Beckett achieve

3'2.

unity between their basic as--

sumptions and the form in which
‘these are expressed. The The-
gatre of the Absurd accordingly
. does not argue about but merely
presents absurdity in terms of
concrete stage images.
To some extent the Absurdists
constitute a reaction to the cer-

titudes and unshakable assump-_

tions of former ages. These ten-
ets have been tested and found
wanting. This philosophical at-
trition renders the Absurdist’s
world unreasonable, without a
rational base.‘ ‘.

“Unlike Wordsworth, Coleridge
was deeply depressed by his loss

New Track Coach
JIWI BANNER

' Frank Carver, athletic Direc-
tor, has made another decision.
This decision, however, wasn’t a
hard one to make. Last week
Carver announced the appoint-
ment of Jim Banner to the posi-

‘tion of head track coach here.

When Carl Rees resigned from
coaching several weeks ago, even
those only remotely familiar with
the track situation pointed to
Banner as. the successor. Carver
veriﬁed this faith in Banner with

the speed with which he appoint-
ed Banner. _

Now it is up to Banner to re-
build Pitt track. He coaches with
an iron hand, but he is also one
of the most respected coaches at
the Field House.

As assistant track coach, Ban-
ner tutored sprinter Bill DclVec-
chio for two years. When Del-
Vecchio graduated last year, he

Another mark of Banner’s ca-

By FRANK GOUVARES

(Mr. Couvares is treasurer of
Students for Peace and a parti-
qipant in the Hdll Education
Project.)

There has been a great
deal of lip-service given to
the idea of “consensus” in
this country. Consensus of
opinion on an issue seems to
‘have become the deciding
factor concerning that IS-
sue’s validity, utility and
even its moral justiﬁcation. As. a
result, dissent (from the Latin,
dissentio——to think apart) is ana-
thema to those who place com-
plete trust in consensus (from
the Latin consentio — to think

along with).

The necessity of dissent as an
instrument for reevaluation and
examination of policy has been

disregarded. When defenders of .
rule by consensus attack those I

with divergent opinions, they
usually allude to their opponents’
lack of knowledge or perhaps his

"mistaken ideological orientation

or even failures in his character.
But when they direct their bar-
rages at student dissenters, they
rely on such terms as “undirect-

. ed rebelliousness,” “Irresponsibil-

ify,” and other familiar descrip-

tive epithets. This attitude to-.

ward dissent can only have as a
result the discouragement of the
process of reevaluation, criticism
and original and innovating think-
ing in America's youth.

The University student is in a

unique position. During his col-

lege years, he confronts, usually
for the first time, the problems
of integrity, identity and his obli-
gations as an individual in a so-

. cial context. His ability to think

conceptually is intensely exploit-
ed and demanded. His sense of

1 community rind social‘ commit-

ment is stimulated and chal-
lenged. As a result he is expect-
'ed to form opinions, to articulate
them, and to defend and advo-

 , c-ate them.

This process is-encouraged by
the fact that as a student the
individual is particularly unac-
countable, i.e. free of obligations
and responsibilities he will one
dayvhave. to assume in pursing
material security. Therefore, his
success at developing an inte-
grated set of values and commit-
ments. during these academic
years will necessarily effect his
whole life. _

convinced of the soundness of
consensus policy, have responded
to their obligation, though for
some, perhaps, belatedly. They
must continue to meet their com-
mitments and maintain their in-
tegrity. They will, hopefully,
clearly proclaim that agreement
is not truth, popularity is not
soundness and consensus is not
democracy.

Why do some students

can shed some light on this
issue. I feel‘ that student

Health) Course
Explained

Although the Student Health
Service places an emphasis on in-
dividual health care and on
health education, the services it
offers to full-time students are
significant and should be famil-
iar to all students.

Injuries (except old and
chronic ones) will not be cared
for by the Health Service, how-
ever, visits for any other“ kind
of emergency can be’ made. at
any time. I/Visits for non-emer-
gency medical care or advice
can be- arranged by making an
appointment either by telephone
(ext. 518) or by contacting the
receptionist in. the Health Service

. office, Brackenridge Hall.

Doctor’s hours are held with-
out an appointment on Satur-

‘ days, Sundays, and holidays for

students with problems needing
professional attention before the
n ex t regular weekday.’ These
hours are posted in the‘ service
and on various bulletin boards
throughout the University.
There_ is no infirmary main-
tained by the Health Service, and

it neither provides nor pays any '

costs associat-ed with bed care.
However, when _ th e Student
Health Service is caring for a
student living in’ a University
residence hall who needs bed
care other than that available in
the residence hall, it will arrange
if possible for all aspects of bed
care in one of the Medical Cen-
ter hospitals.

. Explanations of student absen-
ces from classes is an “area in
which the Health Service as-
sumes no responsibility. These
absences are a matter between
the student, his instructor, and
the University. Students antici-
pating an absence of more than
one session of a‘ class should
notify the instructor involved,

learn to play golf by reading
every book in the library on the
subject but really has no idea
until he hooks his first drive or
misses his short putt. The stu-
dent who goes from his room to
his class to the cafeteria and
back to his room again or the one
who comes in the ‘morning by
trolley and leaves in the after-
noon immediately after his class-
es, like our textbook golfer, does
n.ot know what student life is.
He lives in a vacuum."

Student activities provide a
source of /identiﬁcation for an in-
dividual. I often hear the phrase,
-“I’m just another number on an
IBM card.” Student activities can
make you an individual. A num-
ber doesn’t tutor a Negro child;
a_number doesn’t sit in front of
a typewriter mulling over a lead
for a news story; a number does
not spend four hours decorating
a ballroom for a dance; a num-
ber ‘does not stay away from a
football game when it's 15 de-
grees and there’s snow on the
ground. '

‘Student activities keep you _

from being a “provincial student.”
He is the student who is locked
in his own discipline. A sociology
ma-jor just as the engineer can
insulate himself in his narrow
specialty. He socializes, studies
and converses within his own
narrow circle. Student activities
allow him to “break. into the-
clean’? Now he has an open‘ ﬁeld.
to cover. . '

You ‘can learn skills through‘ »

student programs that you can
use later in life. As a president
of a student organization or as
the chairman of an event you
must by necessity learn to chair-
a meeting using Robert’s Rules
of Order. This will come in han-
dy for you in a PTA meeting,‘ a
committee meeting of the United
Fund or a Chamber of Commerce

convention. Financial know-how .

can be learned,’ which will be
invaluable in. your professional
life, when you write up a cor-
poration report. ~
-You can grow as a person as
a result of your student parti-
cipation. You assume r_esponsibil-

A ities in’ a light that you must ful-

ﬁll them. YOU get- to see-the
University in a light that isn't
seen by 'the non participant stu-
dent. And most importantly, you
learn to work with others,
