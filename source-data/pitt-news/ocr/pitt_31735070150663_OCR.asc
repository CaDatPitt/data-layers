Former SGB candidates ob ect to election-day truce

All ix candidates from the Fifth and Forbes slateslwere elected to the 2013 Student Government Board. Boby Miziall Assistant Visual Editor

Truce ﬂew’ ‘mega;-slzztefﬁom allegations of wrongdoing

Thomas Visco &

The Pitt News Staﬁ”

The student supervisor for the
latest election, which brought to

- office the current Student Govern-

ment Board — including Presi-
dent Gordon Louderback and

all ﬁve of his campaign running T

mates, among others — now says
she regrets not investigating al-
leged violations of the elections
code. Many students involved
with the November 2012 SGB
election, including a current
Board member, believe this lack
of investigation put certain candi-
dates for seats on the 2013 Board
at an unfair disadvantage.

Even Kenyon‘ Bonner, SGB’s

chief liaison withinPi.tt’s admin_- g
g istration — who said he defers to

the opinion of last year’s elections
chairwoman, Annie Brown, on
matters of the election — agreed
that “we have to think about how
to prevent anything like this from
happening in the future.”

By “this,” Bonner is referring

to the repeated deals between SGB .

slates to withdraw and prevent
charges of campaign wrongdoing
before the elections committee

could examine charges in official .

hearings. If more hearings had
transpired and produced some
guilty verdicts, the guilty parties
could have lost votes from the

ﬁnal tally, potentially. changing .

the election’s outcome.‘-More than

two ‘months after the election, A

details about these deals have

now emerged and have garnered
various reactions.

Brown says she regrets not
having personally investigated a
charge — which was withdrawn
— that Louderback’s Forbes and
Fifth slate improperly solicited
departmental endorsements.

“That’s my mistake,” she said.
“This is my fatal flaw, that I, once
it got withdrawn, did not pursue
it.”

Brown also said she recognizes
the concerns with fairness, and
hopes the next elections chair-
man will adequately address them
by adjusting the elections code.

V The deal brokering climaxed
on SGB election day, Nov. 15,
when Kate Malekoff, a Pitt senior

HOW IT WENT DOWN

On election day, Nov. l5, 2012, the two major
alliances of Student Government Board candidates
(Forbes and Fifth, and Steel and Stone mega—slates)
agreed to drop charges of elections code wrongdo-
ing against each other. This ”truce” involved ’

many people and events.

and the Forbes slate campaign manager,
emailed all candidates in the hopes of strik-
ing a “truce.”

Mike Nites, who won election to the
Board and took office this month, said
that when he heard about the truce, his
initial reaction was: “No way, I’m not a
fan of this.”

Figuring that any penalties due to the al-
legations —— called “infractions” —— would
cancel out, Brown encouraged all candi-
dates to accept the deal and avoid the hear-
ing procedures stipulated by the elections
code. Although Brown’s encouragement
was emailed to all candidates, only the
“mega-slates” —- alliances between the

- winning Forbes and Fifth slates and the

opposing Steel and Stone slates — agreed
to the truce. This effectively freed the four

slates, each consisting of three candidates,
from all allegations of wrongdoing ﬁled
that day. -

But if the four slates had been found
guilty of violations, they could have lost
votes from their election—day tallies, and
the deductions could have changed election
outcomes for candidates not associated
with the mega-slates.

“Sure it cancels out for Forbes and Fifth
and Steel and Stone, but it doesn’t cancel
out for Lauren Barney,” Nites said, refer-
ring to the independent candidate in this
past election. “Withdrawing them would
have a different outcome in terms of votes.”

The candidates who won the election
in November and were inaugurated earlier
this month are responsible for allocating
the $2.3 million Student Activities Fund,
to which students contribute $80 per se-
mester through the Student Activities Fee.

Unclear withdrawal policy

From Nov. 12 — the ﬁrst day that cam-
paigns could hang ‘signs and distribute
ﬂiers — until the last day of the election, a‘
ﬂood of allegations rushed back and forth
between slates, with candidates and sup-
porters encouraged to aim phone cameras
at anything that could generate infractions.

An email from Forbes slate campaign
manager Kate Malekoff instructed Forbes
and Fifth campaign supporters to forward
pictures of code—breaking to her, saying,
“If you see other slates doing things that
it says you cannot do, PLEASE text [omit-
ted phone number of Malekoff] immedi-
ately with a picture, if possible, so we can
handle it.”

Althoughino one can or will say which
slate ﬁred the ﬁrst shot against the other by
ﬁling an infraction, one word consistently
sticks in the former candidates’ memory
of the election season: “petty.”

-. “It deﬁnitely became petty by the end,”

said Nites, who was a member of the Steel

slate. “By the end of it, it wasn’t the best
feeling to have at the end of the day. It
didn’t ﬁt ’r:ight,,in terms of how everything
playedoutl‘ and how everyone treated’ each
other.” ‘ ’ i _ _

Brown would not reveal how many in-
fractions were ﬁled during campaigning.
According to Brown, she is “not obligated
to disclose infractions if they did not result
in-a complete hearing.”

Despite what appeared to be multiple
allegations of wrongdoing, every infraction
ﬁled to Brown except one escaped formal
judgment from the elections committee.
And no candidates incurred any penalties
over the course of campaigning.

Much of what transpired revolves
around Brown’s decisions and the latitude
allowed to thefelections chair under the
SGB elections code + 13 pages of rules that

control campaign activities — and espe-l

cially around the withdrawal of infractions.

But candidates have always withdrawn
infractions during SGB races, Brown said.
In this year’s election, Brown helped con-
vince candidates that withdrawing the al-
legations against each other was in their
mutual interest, according to Brown and
correspondence from Brown to candidates
that was obtained by The Pitt News.

Consequently, Brown said, despite an
unexpectedly high number of infractions,
Brown’s election committee held only one
hearing.

According to the elections code, hear-
ings require a quorum of six elections com-
mittee members — traditionally appointed
by the chair — and a guilty verdict requires
a simple majority. The only elections hear-
ing this year took place, Brown said, when
then-Board member Alex Murdoch was
accused of being a member of a Forbes and
Fifth Facebook group, violating an elec-
tions code rule that forbids sitting mem-
bers of SGB from supporting or campaign-
ing for any candidates running to replace
them. The case was dropped because the
defense argued the evidence was found
illegally.

Processing so many infractions accord-
ing to those steps could have meant op-
pressive inconvenience and assault to “the
sanity of candidates,” Brown said.

“Nobody wanted to have the hearings.
A lot of time it became too much of a dis-
traction,” she said, referring speciﬁcally
to “petty” infractions such as incorrectly
hung posters.

“A poster hanging on a window — all
of the candidates have to come in,” Brown
said, describing the inconvenience that
would have been caused by holding a hear-
ing for every infraction.

The elections code addresses several
kinds of campaign behavior. The rules most
commonly invoked by campaigns ﬁling
infractions concern the paper campaigning
period — which usually begins a few days
before the election — during which the
campaigns can distribute posters around
campus. The code bars campaigns from

placing posters on glass doors and from

obstructing opponents’ ﬂiers.

But not all infractions involved a poster
hanging on a window.

“There’s a big difference between a
group performing on behalf of a group 
[when] they did not have an endorsement,
or if someone hangs a poster on awindow,”
Brown said. .

But if infractions truly varied in sever-
ity, their treatment in the past election did
not reﬂect it. ‘

Brown said that drawing lines between
different types of infractions “seems very
arbitrary to me. How do we determine
what’s below the line and what’s above
the line?”

Brown argues that her discretionary
powers, granted to her by elections code
clause 104.04 so she can “ensure a fair,

honest and efﬁcient election,” allowed her
to condone infraction withdrawals regard-
less of severity. 7

“It falls under discretion and prec-
edent,” she said. “Infractions had been
allowed to be withdrawn before.”

_Louderback emails

Invoking this discretionary clause just
before election day, Brown decreed in an
email to all candidates that they could not
solicit an endorsement from an organiza-
tion already endorsing an opposing can-
didate or slate. '

But according to infraction memos ﬁled
against Forbes and Fifth, certain political
emails sent to hundreds of students on
Nov. 14 and 15 may have broken Brown’s
new rule, as well as elections code 209.2,
which states that “endorsing organizations
may not promote candidates without hav-
ing submitted an [endorsement form.]”

These political emails, sent in support
of Louderback — who won the presiden-
cy — may have garnered stiff penalties if
brought to a hearing, according to Dave
Gau, a graduate student and former Board
member who advised the Steel and Stone
slates in their campaigning.

In the early-morning hours of Nov. 14,
the day before the election, Brown emailed
candidates the new rule she imposed to bar
candidates from soliciting endorsements
that had “already been issued to their op-
ponent,” as she said in the email sent to all
candidates that day.

“It didn’t make sense that a department
or any group would endorse two presiden-
tial candidates, because you’re directly in
opposition,” she said in an interview the
week ofjan. 13. V

Less than a day after the new provi-
sion went into effect, Bryanna Snyder, the
student services assistant in the Civil and
Environmental Engineering department,
sent an email expressing support for Loud-
erback —- a civil engineering major — via
the CEE student distributionlist, which
Snyder said reaches 270 to 300 students.

That email went out at 3:41 p.m. on
Nov. 14, and Snyder sent a second email
at 8:32 a.m. on Nov. 15, election day, with
the subject line, “Vote!,” encouraging Civil
Engineering students to vote for Louder-
back and his “team.” The second email
listed the names of candidates on both the
Forbes and Fifth slates.

Snyder said the ﬁrst email was a re-
formatted message from a supporter of
Louderback, although she does not have
any record or memory of the identity of
the supporter. '

“It was one of those things like, ‘Can you

forward this to the students?”’ she said,.

describing the initial solicitation.

V But Snyder had already signed a depart-
mental endorsement form for the Steel
slate, which included..Louderback’s op-
ponent for the SGB presidency, Natalie
Rothenberger. Gau said he procured the
endorsement from Snyder at least a week

before the election.

Brown learned about the ﬁrst email
shortly after it went out, and she contacted
Snyder to clarify that SGB elections rules
would not allow the Civil Engineering
department to endorse two candidates,
Brown and Snyder conﬁrm.

Citing the elections code, Steel cam-
paign manager Kaitlyn Suber ﬁled two
infractions against Forbes and Fifth on
election day regarding the emails, claim-
ing “this is unacceptable” in an infraction
memo obtained by The Pitt News. In the
two infraction memos, Suber argued that

the emails violated Brown’s new discre-
tionary rule against opposing endorse-
ments as well as the code’s rule against
endorsement solicitation without an en-
dorsement form. Suber declined to com-
ment on this story.

Snyder then sent a third email to the
distribution list, in which she wrote, “Just
a quick reminder that I personally sup-
port Gordon Louderback in this election
and would like for you to, asgwell. Please

' log into your my.pitt.edu account and

vote Gordon for President!!” Snyder said
that the purpose of the third email was
to “clarify” that she was not speaking for
the department.

Louderback said he doesn’t know who

sent the solicitation email to Snyder.

“A lot of these ambiguous questions
of emails going out is merely friends and
their supporters showing their support
of their candidate and people who are de-
tached from the election process,” Loud-
erback said.

Snyder’s emails reached hundreds of
students’ personal inboxes three times.
Several people believe that, because of
its scope, the Louderback infraction tran-

- scended mere “petty” infractions.

“In my opinion, that’s a bigger infrac-
tion,” said Nites.

Brown expressed a similar sentiment
toward the emails.

“There are infractions that were petty,

fSUMMER

 EDGE

and there were infractions that were a big
deal,” she said.

But the infraction was withdrawn be-
fore it could progress through the code’s
arbitration steps to a hearing. During the
week ofjan. 13, Brown said that the infrac-
tion making it to a hearing would not have
guaranteed any specific outcome because
“it would depend on how it was argued.”

If the hearing found thatlsomeone af-
ﬁliated with Louderback’s campaign solic-
ited the emails from Snyder, then Loud-
erback and his running mates could have
broken the rules, given that the elections
code requires “each candidate to police
his or her own campaign and staf .” On the
other hand, the hearing could have traced
the emails to an unrelated supporter, as
Louderback suggests. ‘

A hearing never took place.

The truce I

An election-day proposal from Male-
koff led to the permanent shelving of the
Louderback infraction, among others. Out
of an effort to stiﬂe a last—minute gush of
infractions between the two mega—slates
and appeal to the noble “purpose of the
day,” Malekoff said she sent an email at
3:14 p.m. to all candidates urging them
to agree to an election day free of ﬁling
infractions. ' F

“I’d like to propose that all infractions
ﬁled today be ‘dropped by the respective
complainants and a ‘truce’ be called for
the rest of the day,” Malekoff wrote in
the email that was sent at 3:14 p.m. on
election day. t

Seven minutes later, Brown replied to
Malekoff’s truce proposal, encouraging
candidates to comply: “I think this would
say a great deal about the integrity of the
candidates and SGB as a whole if this was
done.” "

After a short deliberation period, the
Forbes and Fifth and Steel and Stone mega-
slates agreed to drop their charges and
promised to not ﬁle any more.

“At the end of the day, we didn’t want
to be in infraction meetings till 2 a.m.,”
Rothenberger said.

In addition to convenience, the truce
may have allowed Rothenberger’s mega-
slate, Steel and Stone, to skirt two infrac-
tions.

In the truce email, Malekoff wrote, “I
have two more violations to ﬁle against
multiple slates.”

Nites said he believes that these re-
ferred to allegations toward his mega-
slate over a restaurant endorsement and
campaign material in the SGB ofﬁce, but
Malekoff would not comment on what she
meant.

No evidence behind the election—day in-
fractions underwent further investigation.

That’s not to say no one tried.

Mary Mallampalli, a Pitt United slate
member who didn’t win a seat on the
Board, reacted unfavorably to the truce,
seeing unfairness in how the truce treated

ELECTIONS

candidates unafﬁliated with the mega-
slates. Two hours after candidates ﬁrst
learned of the truce, Mallampalli texted
Brown asking if she could reﬁle the Loud-
erback infraction concerning the Snyder
emails, once it was tabled.

But in a text message, Brown denied
Mallampalli’s request, saying, “Kate and
her team said they wouldn’t ﬁle anything
against Pitt United and you don’t have to
do the same if it bothers you.  That being
said,” Brown said, “you are not permit-
ted to ﬁle any infractions that have been
withdrawn by any candidates.”

Nothing in the elections code forbids
candidates from refiling infractions that
they or others had earlier withdrawn.

Brown said she created the rule against
reﬁling under duress, and she noted how
stressful the last few hours of the election
can be for all parties involved. Brown said
she believed that Mallampalli intended to
resubmit the exact documentation Steel
and Stone had ﬁled, instead of writing
original infraction paperwork, and she

said she now regrets the misunderstand— .

ing. -
“Maybe she should have clariﬁed what

she meant, and maybe I should have clari-

ﬁed what I meant,” she said.

Reactions

Several people connected with the
November 2012 election remember with
regret the truce and the limitless with-
drawals of infractions. .

Tim Larkin, who lost hisrun for a seat
on the Board, said he feels slighted by the
process. Unaffiliated with the mega—slates
and running on a two—person slate —~ Kes-
sler-Larkin 2012 — Larkin and running
mate Hans Kessler lost without a single
infraction ﬁled against them, according
to Brown. _ , ‘

Larkin said the rarity with which po-
tential wrongdoing faced investigation
spoiled the 2012 election.

“I think all infractions should be car-
ried out,” Larkin said. “Call me old fash-
ioned that an election should be run the
way it’s supposed to.”

Lauren Barney, who ran and lost as an
independent candidate, agrees that “once
people ﬁled infractions, I think those
should have been addressed.”

Nevertheless, Barney believes some
amount of infraction withdrawal is war-
ranted. Fairness of a withdrawalpolicy
“depends on the severity of the infraction.”

“Some of them deﬁnitely created more
votes for the party that committed the
infractions,” she said.

Mallampalli is upset with the truce’s
effect on election day. -

“Just because a truce was made doesn’t
wipe away the mistakes that were made,”
she said.

Even though some infraction withdraw-
als beneﬁted Mallampalli’s slate earlier in
the campaign, she said she would rather

January 28, 2013 1 The Pitt News l vwvvv.pitthevvs.com

not have had any withdrawals take place.

“I don’t think any infractions should
have been wiped away,” she said.

Nites, who won a seat, agrees.

“If there’s proof, I don’t know how you
could ignore the proof. I don’t know how
you can withdraw evidence incriminating
someone,” he said.

Rothenberger, who ran for president
on the Steel slate and lost to Louderback,
said during the week of Jan. 13 that while
she appreciated the intent of the truce
to reduce last—minute partisan pettiness,
“maybe it wasn’t fair that there was a truce
between our four slates.”

Malekoff said she was not worried
about the truce’s effects on candidates

unaffiliated with mega-slates.

“I really wasn’t concerned about an
optimal situation,” she said, referring to
involving these candidates in decision-
making over the truce. “At that point, I no
longer cared who won the election. I just
wanted it to be over.”

In contrast, Brown said she empathizes
with those who feel shortchanged by the
2012 election process.

“Any time infractions are withdrawn
that had the potential [to lead to vote de-
ductions],” Brown said, “I guess the people
who had been following the rules or hadn’t
had any rules called on them, that would
be a disadvantage to them and I could see
why that’s unfair.”

Brown also calls for reforms to the elec-
tions process and code.

“[The reforms should be made] in order
to avoid withdrawn infractions being used
as leverage and being used to persuade
other people to drop theirs, and seem-
ingly putting independent candidates at
a disadvantage,” Brown said. “Once you
ﬁle an infraction, you shouldn’t be able
to withdraw.”

Although President Louderback’s slate
beneﬁted from the confused election sys-
tem, he, too, expressed reservation for
limitless withdrawals during an interview
held the week ofjan. 13, saying, “Any viola-
tion deserves to go to hearing, regardless
if it’s correct or not.” I

THE LEFT-HAND SIDE

 

Academia’s leftward tilt doesn’t prevent honest and unbiased scholarship

Eric Baldwin
Columnist

What does being unbiased mean?
Is it possible for people to be
completely unbiased and im-
partial in their judgments and
actions? So often in academia,
there is a leftist bias. While I
identify as a member of the left
and, therefore, support people
and institutions championing
thecauses attributed to liberal
ideology, the larger implica-
tions of our nations’ research-
ers and academics having an
overwhelming leftist bias is

worrisome.

My thoughts on the role of
bias and its implications re-
cently came to a climax while
I was attending a lecture by a
distinguished faculty member in
the life sciences. The professor
made ajoking remark about the
“lunatic fringe” that the right
wing of the political spectrum
has become in this country. _In
a separate instance, a professor
openly claimed that anyone who

identified as a Republican suf- V

fered from a “mental or moral
defect.” While I may agree on a
personal level, the implications
of the professoriate openly ex-

pressing its political ideology
while teaching or researching
are disturbing.

As leftism and science have
become increasingly synony-
mous — perhaps erroneously,
given that many leftists hold
non-scientific bpeliefs such as
opposition to genetically modi-
fied food and vaccination —— it
is critical that academics and
researchers remain unbiased in

,_ their work in order to maintain
a public culture that values fact

   

an£l.;_t_*l‘-gason over jealous dogma-
tiismand irrationality.

‘ ‘Data indicatesithat a substan-
tial divide exists in the universi-

ty setting. In a study conducted
examining the party affiliation
of tenure-track faculty members
at 11 research universities, 46
percent were openly Demo-
cratic, and another 44 percent
identiﬁed with left—leaning third
parties or other philosophies.
Only 9 percent of faculty iden-
tified as openly Republican.
With conservatism being in the

distinct minority, academia has‘

become just another example of
the ever—increasing political ex-
tremism inour public discourse.

Much of this has to do with
increased digitization and
vastly augmented exposure to

political reporting to the point
of fetishization. Although this
information exposure may be
considered a positive step for
an advanced democracy such as
ours, in this case, it has caused
a problem. These political ide-
ologies become sufficiently in-
grained in the character traits
of professors and scholars,
bleeding into work in the lecture
halls and laboratories, poten-
tially causing biased teaching
and skewed results favoring one
ideology over another.

Part of this political bias is

justified. With fallacious claims
coming from Republicans re-
garding the nature of rape and
validity of creationism, it is dif-
ficult for the research commu-
nity to associate with a party
that makes claims with such a
lack of regard for scientiﬁc fact.
According to Puneet Opal in The
Atlantic, only 6 percent of sci-
entists identify as Republicans,
and 68 living recipients of the
Nobel Prize endorsed Demo-
cratic candidates.

There isn’t necessarily a
problem with the majority of
the professoriate holding left-
ist views. Political affiliation is
irrespective of professional be-
havior on campuses. The issue
is when academics bring their
political ideologies to the lec-
ture halls or into their research.
While all citizens, regardless of
profession, are welcome to hold
whichever political beliefs they
choose, these beliefs shouldn’t
be brought into the workplace.
This should be especially salient
in academia, given that academ-
ics are held to a higher standard
of intellectual maturity. Personal

ideologies at work cause profes-
sors to fail at their primary ob-
jectives: to teach, clarify, elabo-
rate and elucidate in respect to
established schools of thought
and scientifically proven fact.
An open and blatant bias is
also foolish for academics at
public research universities
working on federal grant re-
search projects. If congressional
Republicans begin to identify
the research and academic com-
munity as a solidly Democratic
voting bloc, then funding for re-
search projects could become
the next political stalemate.
With sensitive research and
people’s livelihoods contingent
on federal research funding, this
is cause for concern.
Regardless of the ideologi-
cal component, it is critical for

academia to remain unbiased P

and impartial for the sake of the
genuine pursuit of science over

personal political ideologies.‘
Some argue that in order to do .

this, a scholar — especially one
in the social sciences  must
consider the arguments of the
opposition: However, iI’d argue

it is not that simple.

Co-nsidering the arguments of
the opposition is a fundamental
component of sound argumenta-

tion in all scholarship, not just
social sciences with potential
political implications. Biological
and physical science research
must be scrutinized as severely
as other branches of academia
to guard against skewed or sup-
pressed research. The impar-
tiality standard should apply
not only to research involving
political factors, but also to the
presentation of all research, re-
gardless of any possible political
ramiﬁcations.

Researchers who allow their
workto be skewed by political
ideology are risking not only
their own integrity, but also the
integrity of public research in-
stitutions and academia at large,
even if that ideology is one that
supports the mission of the very
institution where the work is be-
ing carried out. The product of

research mustlbe conducted and ‘

presented in a way that places
priority on factual results re-
gardless of whether they support
the political aims of the party
with which most in the research
community identify. This leftist

‘bias in academia is not an under-
= lying trend that is a concern for

the future, but a major theme
and a threat to academia today.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

Dave Uhrmacher
Staff W riter

The Pitt women’s basketball team will host
defending national champion and currently
No. 2-ranked Notre Dame on Wednesday
night in what could be the Panthers’ toughest
test all season.

Coming off a 74-65 loss on Saturday to
Marquette, a game in which the Panthers
(9-8, 0-3 Big East) showed their ability to
compete in the Big East, Pitt looks to break
a 22-game Big East conference losing streak
against the Irish at 7 p.m. at the Petersen
Events Center.

With such a young lineup, not much is
expected of this Pitt squad against the pow-
erhouse Fighting Irish, but sophomore for-
ward Cora McManus, coming off a 15-point
performance in the loss to Marquette, looks
at this game as a wonderful opportunity for
the Panthers.

“We are going to play hard, we have noth-
ing to lose going into this game,” she said. “I
don’t care who we are playing, we are going
to go out there with no fear.”

McManus will be joined in the frontcourt
by junior forward Asia Logan, who leads
the team in scoring (15.5 points per game)
but has struggled her past two games, only
managing to shoot 5-for-25 (20 percent)
from the ﬁeld. Getting Logan back on track
will be key for the Panthers if they want to
pull off the upset victory.

Notre Dame (15-1, 4-0 Big East) is led
by three—time All-American and arguably
the best point guard in the country, senior
Skylar Diggins.Junior guard Kayla McBride,

an Erie, Pa., native who attended Villa Maria
Academy, ranks second on the team in scor-
ing, behind Diggins. Both players average
approximately 15 points per game and the
Irish as a whole average 83 points per game,
emerging victorious by an average 25-point
margin.

Pitt head coach Agnus Berenato is eager
to be tested against such a strong squad at
home.

“I’m glad Notre Dame is coming to our
house,” she said. “We like playing at home,
and they are a great‘ team. They are No. 2
in the nation. They won the national title
game last year. Just last week they went in
and beat No. 1 Connecticut at their house.”

The only loss for the Irish this season
came back on Dec. 5, when they lost 73-61
to currently No. 1-ranked Baylor at home.

‘ Notre Dame sophomore guard and for-
mer Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Athlete of the
Year Madison Cable, a Mt. Lebanon gradu-
ate, travels back to Pittsburgh for the ﬁrst
time in her collegiate career. She is averaging
4.2 points per game off the bench for head
coach Muffet McGraw.

The Panthers, who start two freshmen,
two sophomores and ajunior, will need to do
every little thing right to stay with the Irish.

Although her team lost by an incredible
76 points against Notre Dame last season,
Berenato remains optimistic that this year’s
clash with the Irish will be different.

“As a player and as a coach, this matchup
is what dreams are made of,” Berenato said.
“You dream about playing the big team. They
are very, very good, but at the same time, we
lace up our sneakers just like they do. It is
ﬁve girls against ﬁve girls.” ﬂ

WRESTLING

Pitt drops match against national powerhouse Oklahoma State

Dustin Gabler
Senior Staff Writer

Despite its best performances at the lower
weight classes all season, the No. 17 Pitt
wrestling team fell to No. 2 Oklahoma
State 26-14 on Sunday.

The Cowboys’ fans packed the Gallagh-
er-Iba Arena in Stillwater, Okla., to cheer
on their wrestlers, and the atmosphere
helped get the Panthers excited for one
of their biggest matches of the season.

“The atmosphere at Oklahoma State
was great,” Pitt’s Shelton Mack said. “The
fans were really into the match, so it made
it that much easier to get ﬁred up. It’s hard
to be in a place like that and not want to
wrestle your absolute best.”

Mack, ranked 17th by InterMat Wres-

tling, has had an up-and-down season
with many close matches.

The 133-pounder was preparing for
a top matchup against Oklahoma State’s
No. 5 Jon Morrison, but instead matched
up with Tyler Dorrell.

After Pitt’s Derrick Nelson was pinned
in the 125-pound match, Mack needed a
big performance, and he came up with
one.

The junior came through with a 13-6
decision for the Panthers with a big ﬁve-
point third period after a takedown, two
near-fall points and an escape.

At 141 pounds, Pitt’s Travis Shaffer
turned in a dominating performance with
a 15-0 technical fall. Shaffer appeared to
have his opponent,]ulian Feikert, pinned
several times, but the referee disagreed.

The loss to Bloomsburg two weeks ago
sparked a lot of the upperclassmen to call
for a change in the team’s approach. Sev-
eral Pitt wrestlers performed much better,
especially considering the higher-quality
competition.

“I was excited about the whole match.
Some people really stepped up,” said Matt
Wilps, the Panthers’ highest-ranked wres-
tler.

With Shaffer’s win, Pitt led the nation-
al-championship-contending Cowboys,
8-6. It would be the last time the Panthers
led in the match.

Oklahoma State’s final five wrestlers
are all ranked and many presented the
Panthers’ wrestlers with their toughest
match of the season.

Pitt’s Ronnie Garbinsky matched up

against top-ranked Jordan Oliver at 149
pounds. Oliver led Garbinsky 2-0 heading
into the third period and then exploded.
The No. 1 wrestler at this weight class hit
Garbinsky with ﬁvetakedowns, running
the ﬁnal score up to 14-4. A

No. 10 Alex Dieringer earned a take-
down and three near-fall points on Pitt’s
Donnie Tasser at 157 pounds and held onto
that lead for an 8-2 victory.

In a matchup of ranked wrestlers, No.
3 Tyler Caldwell of Oklahoma State de-
feated No. 13 Tyler Wilps. Caldwell led
5-0 heading into the ﬁnal period. After
Wilps escaped, his attempts at a takedown
of his own all proved unsuccessful and
he lost 5-1.
