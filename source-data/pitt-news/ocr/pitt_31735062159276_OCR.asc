Chest Drive
Plans Talks

See page two for the second in
a. series of columns by M110 Ponte

on the Pitt Chest Drive.

On Wednesday Nov. 2, classroom
sessions will be invaded by vol-
unteer undergraduates, speaking on
behalf of the Pitt Chest Fund Drive.

Each speaker will be responsible
for a short talk in several class
rooms emphasizing the imP0ff3IlC€
of the Chest iDrive and appealing
to the students for a contribution.

Last year each student was asked
to contribute two dollars to’ the
fund. The 1949 spring drive was
the best: in the”history of the cam-
paign in the amount of money sub-

scribed. Contributions totaled
$3,299 surpassing the goal by $300.
Two,,, more organizations have

been added to the roll call of or-
ganizations which receive money
from the Pitt Chest. Ccntributions
will now be chanheled to 100 groups.
Janet O’Hagan, chairman of the
speaking division, has announced
that on Oct. 27 the volunteer speak-
ets will gather at a box luncheon
in Stephen Foster Memorial. It will
serve the double purpose of also
giving the leaders a chance to in-
struct the student orators. A short
movie will furnish the entertainment.

Students packed info the Pan-

Moie Available

 ther Room, eighth floor, last Fri-

day to see Pitt upset Northwestern
via the movies.

This was the initial showing of
Pitt’s football contests in a series
of films sponsored by Men’s Council.
In‘ the following weeks Council

‘will show on each Thursday films

of the preceeding Saturday's game.
Showings, free to all students, will
be at Stephen Foster Memorial Hall,
every Thursday, during the fifth,
sixth, and seventh hours.

This is the first. time that the
Athletic Department has released
films of the games before the sea-
son was over. Credit for securing
permission of the Athletic Depart-
ment to use the films belongs to
Theodore H. Biddle, dean of men,
according to_ Howard Greenberger,
Council president.

These are the films that the Ath-
letic Department uses for studying
the defects of the team.

Alan Goldberg, college sophomore,
is in charge of the showings. A man-
ager of the team will be at each
showing to add a commentary. The
films will be shown by a licensed
operator, he announced.

"These movies,” said Green-_
berger, "are part of Council’s ex-
paningd program which has already
program which has already included
televising the World Series. It is
also in actualitypa trial performance
to see what turnouts can be ex-
pectedfor fiture events in the same
room.”

Greenberger enumerated among
“future events’ atelevsiorrlounge,
frequent tea dances, and a game
room.

Council’s vigorous program also
included the enlarged Freshman
orientation program. This semester
was the first time in manyjyears at
Pitt that the Beanie has been an
institution here.

Council planned and administrated
the program which is designed to
foster school spirit. It is now work-
ing on a trial method to punish vio-
lators of the Freshman program.

200 Take Diabetic Test  

Coeds Lack

Almost 200 students have availed
themselves of the free Diabetes
detection test during the first four
days it was sponsored. .

The test, sponsored jointly b
the Men and Women""s'"iHealth Ser-
vices, has of yet received no_ fe-
male takers, however. ‘

Dr. H. C. Carlson, head of the
Men's Health Service, announced
that only two tests have showed a
positive reaction. And these, he
added, were not from the student
body. .

The diabetes campaign is running
through‘ Friday of this week.

The board of deans have a?
cepted Student Congress’ pet
tion for official dismissals f,

although modifying somewha
the request._ ‘ ,

Theodore W. Biddle, dean of men
appeared before Congress yester
day afternoon to present the deans)
recommendation. ,

The deans concurred icompletel
with legislators’ plan to stage 
day morning pep meetings befor‘.
the Ohio State and Penn State game;
at the Stadium. One hour has been
allotted on Friday mornings, Nov. ~
and 18, for rallies. .

Congress’ petition for four hours
to celebrate “major upsets” wa
slashed to a single definite hour
if an anticipated surprise over on’
of the strong foes the Panthers fac
later in the season materializes.

However, while granting the sin ,
hour, which Dean Biddle said shoul-
be sufficient to toast the victoriou
Pitts, the deans did make tentativf
allowances for a second one-h
celebration if the gridders pull
second upset. -

The deans’ stamp on the proposa
sanctions complete dismissal fo
these rallies and frees student
from the danger of receiving cut}
and relieves faculty members’ re
sponsibility for holding classe
during these special hours, Which
will be set up later.

Congress’ reaction to the ac
ceptance and modification was no

Dean Biddle revealed that a’ de

was the conduct of the student Cele

Sailors Memorial and the faithfulre

Dave Fox, chairman of Congress

approval of the body, submitted th
petition to the board ofdeans Oct.‘ ~

"Toooften pep-rallies are hel

 Student Congress and the board of deans, have pouredthe
sometimes shapeless student football rallies into a defining mold.
Through a Congress petition and the deans’ acceptance, with
some revision of the petition, the hazy situation has been trans-
formed into a system. , .
It was Congress’ idea, as expressed by Dave Fox, assemblies
chairman, to take the pain out of celebrations. This, it was ob-
served, came when someone, at the last minute, decided‘ a game
merited or required a rally to brew some spirit.

The fog was even denser following an upset victory. "A few
geager men would huddle in the early morning, weigh their chances
of stirring up a little excitement, then start roaming the halls,
 marshalling support.

‘ This, often times, took some time and persuasion, because
University officials or student bodies couldn't officially sanction
the ‘assemblies. “

Now they have it down in black and white. The students and
the University know where they stand and can plan for what’s
coming. They are in no danger of being hit suddenly with a re-
ouest for a pre-game pep meeting when Ohio State brings its Rose-
Bowl aspirants into Pitt Stadium. It's scheduled now.

up So is a rally before the Penn State season finale. The deans
have alsoallowed for the celebrating wave that has been sweep-
ingthe student body after the Panthers drop a strong opponent
‘unexpectedly, a habit: they’ve adopted in the last two years.
I. I Here, though, is where the deans cramped, Congress’ style.
Congress asked for a pair of two-hour dismissals to fete victories.
The deans, Theodore W. Biddle, dean of men, said, he felt the
period too big and too damaging to the late MWF morning classes.
But, when a win is judged a “major upset,” the students will
have a free hour to blow off organized steam. And another 60
minutes has been conditionally allowed, if the Panthers forge
(‘another surprise win. '

‘will only be in the underdog’s position to pull an upset twice
;more this year. 
, ‘Thile the action of the deans is designed to put a method to
the madness, it yet avoids being static. The hours, either three
for“ four, .will hold, but the outcomes and pre-“game conditions can
still be adequate reasons for shifts.

qduct during the recent Northwestern victory celebration was view-
‘ed with approval by the deans as they considered the Congress
proposal. .

 Good restrained conduct and a faithful return to afternoon
Vjclasses was noted by the deans, as they set up the four-hour
’ ally slate. C p

M The situation boils down to a clear situation. The students
‘now know they will have time off for victory and pre-game cele-
‘brations,. the faculty knows that the rallies are officially-granted
dismissals .from classes which are so planned so as not to dis-
firlupt seriously the study calendar, and the News knows that the
‘University and students can get together successfully for each
other’s mutual benefit. ‘

Two hours should be adqeuate. Frorr here and now, the Pitts I

Pitt Chest‘ 

This year, besides furnishing
food packages, CARE is co-operat-
ing with the World Student Service
Fund in supplying textbooks to
needy foreign students.

Compared to the University where
the worst possible situation exists
when about thirty students may find
themselves competing for five books
in the Reserve Room, but still have
their choice of several other well-
stocked libraries, the conditions
in Europe are deplorable.

At a college in Greece over 1,000
students are sharing from two to
five copies of each textbook. When
Amsterdam University was reopened
in 1947, only twelve economics
bookswere available for every 500
students.

In Italy many students are unable
to attend important lectures and
demonstrations, and because there
are so few books, they must manage
the best they ‘can with published
lecture notes.

In a world where less than half
the human race can read or write
and" something like five per cent
have completed high school, the
work of spreading education is vi-
tally
and food to European countries is
one of our best insurances for a
more secure future in which totali-
tarianism and war will have less
opportunity to breed.

You have only to glance over
some of the thank you letters written

. to Pitt to get a true picture of the

people who_ benefit by our gifts:

Next I climbed in and backed in-
to the middle of the street, with
much difficulty, for that most nobly
enraged he-man had yanked the
valve stems out of two of my tires.
The next minute I spent disgus-
tedly wondering if the word ‘decent’
was ever worth saying again; but
then things began to happen so fast
I didn’t have time to think. Zoom, a
big Bell Telephoneyscreeched to a
halt and two burly truck drivers
hopped out. In another second a
man who was sitting on a park
bench was inspecting the front tire

' which was half off its rim. ‘Wha

H°PPin?’ asked one of the drivers.
I.told him. ‘Dirtiest trick I ever
saw pulled,’ he said. In a matter
of some twenty minutes I was on
my way thanks to two truck drivers
and a man who was sitting onva
park bench. They would accept no
material .thanks, not even for valve
stems. Need I say more?

DINKS DEBUNKED‘?

What happened to that contro-
versial subject —_ the dinks? Either
violations are as scarce as'cheese-
cake at a WCTU convention or

~ upperclassmen are very lax atte-

porting infractions, (of which there
have been many.

With three weeks of the six-
week dink season gone, Council
has not even set up a court to try
offenders. Maybe a mock funeral
for freshman dinks is in order.

TUCK SHOP REVISITED

Latest news from the Tuck Shop
is that they are now offering an
“Arsenic and old Lace” sundae.
They probably will use the arsenic
they have left after they make their
famous 8 cent coffee. There ought
to be a law requiring that lab
aprons be ' worn while drinking
coffee in the Red or Blue.

NEGLECTED CAMPAIGNS
Two very Worthy campaigns

. seem to be getting the brush-off

from students. One is the diabetes
campaign which is being extended
another week to give students
further opportunity to take the test.
The other is the Student Con-
gress-backer‘ “Sun-Telegraph trip
to Philly. ihere must be more’

‘than 33 loyal rooters who want to

save considerable money by ‘buying
one of the $10.35 train tickets. If
there aren’t at leastl267 more‘ tic-
kets bought, the ideal is off, With
the team performing in such fine
fashion, that would be a shame.

INTERESTING INCIDENTS

This one you don’t have to
believe if you don’t want to, but it
really happened. One of the girls
who participated in the Lantern
Night ceremony was_waiting for a
street car, holding Her lantern in
,her hand. A prosperous looking
drunk walked up to her and asked
her how to put the money. The
girl hastily explained that she
wasn’t soliciting, and that her lan-
tern was not a collection bucket.
The drunk looked hurt and went
away mumbling:

‘I thought you were from the
Salvation Army.’

And there was a freshman girl
who said that she was ‘going to the
Panhandle affair Saturday night.’

Outshining the Northwestern foot-
ballers play ‘against Pitt is the
honesty of one of their students or
rooters. Publications Adviser Paul
F. Lohmeyer lost his wallet at the
away game. It was returned by mail
Friday with all money and cards
‘intact.

ONCE TOLD TALES

Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald
might well be called a doctor to
the third power. He can write L.'H.D.,
LL.D., and HH.D. after his name.

Dr. Peter Gray, head of the biology
department, once did research work
on the detrioration of army eqiup-
ment in tropical climates. .For one
experiment he used hcmemade trop-
ical islands --/in cookie jar. ‘

A real collaborator is Richard F.
Daubert, research professor and
administrator in the chemistry de-
partment. He has co-authored more
than 50 articles contributed to chem-
istry periodicals.

LOCAL NEWS

There was a rumor about Friday
that one of the frats planned to send
a motor caravan down to Mountaineer
Field to bringback the once-denied

« goal posts. However more sensible

heads prevailed and the foray didn’t‘
materialize. It would have been a
very foolish trick at this late date.
The loyal rooters from Duquesne
met with a cool reception here
yesterday. ‘Twas no more than
they deserved after the icy coopera-
tion Pitt raiding parties‘ have met
there in the past. Our advice to
them: Stay in your own backyard.

More power to your ‘splendid or-
ganization. In my book your outfit
is tops.

PANTHER. CUP WINNERS--Kappa Kappa Gammas (left to right) Ann

.;..p....... G... Cup 

   

Van Kirk, Kash Herron, Mary Furlong, Barbara Hicks, and Marilyn Brey
line up as Ralph Douglas presents the cup they won temporary posses-
sion of for selling the most Panthers.

The Kappa Kappa Gamma soror-
ity pushed the biggest rock in the
landslide sale of the Panther maga-
zine last Wednesday.

In doing so they have become the
first sorority to hold the Panther’s
gold cup, given at each issue to the
sorority that sells the most Pan-
thers. At the end of the school year
the sorority credited with selling
the most Panthers throughout the
entire year keeps the cup.

The P2/anther’s initial issue was
a complete sellout. They even sold
copies slated for their advertisers.

Ruth Kunst, of Chi Omega soror-
ity, sold the most copies of any
individual member. At the end of
the year the individual who has
sold the most copies receives a
prize of 25 dollars.

These two promotion stunts, the

Placement Office Sells

Seniors To Industries

By MAUREEN MCMAHAN

How would youlike the job of selling the abilities of Pitt stu-

dents to the nation?

That is what Charles H. Ebert, director of the Placement Bur-
eau, does every day. He has the job of contacting, cultivating and
convincing personnel men of industries that Pitt turns out superior

graduates.

Federalists
Slatelweeting

“Would many of us be surprised
if we were at war next week and
within a couple of months Pitt looked
like a girls’ college?’ 

Such are the questions asked by
the Pitt Student Federalists, whose
meetings thisfall are being held at
7 o’clock Tuesday evenings, room
1202 C1. ‘

World government is the goal of
the.Federalists, a group of Pitt
students and faculty members who
believe that peaceful relations can
be worked out between governments
just as cures have been found for.
diseases which strike individuals.

According to Fred Kane, member
of the Federalist executive com-
mittee, the organization believes
"that this country, which led the»
way to the atomic bomb, should
also lead the way to the one in-
'strument that can expel this horror
from human relations -- world govern-
ment.”

That the subject is one which
concerns us all is indicated by Kane.
"We've got to expect,” he says,
"that Russia will use the A-bomb --
in a few years, or a few days. Pitts-

: burgh is close to number one target!”

For information about the organ-
ization and its meetings call John
Spanor, president of the Pitt Student
Federalists, at Locust 1-2538, or

,the Pittsburgh Area Council office

at Grant 1-7852.

Trial Like 
The possibility that c e Phi

Kappa fraternity will have to stand
trial at another hearing in Common

‘Pleas? Court was revealed today by

Phi Kap attorney Robert A. Jarvis.
According to Jarvis the fraternity
will in all probability have to ap-
pear again before Judge A. Marshall
Thcmpson within the next week or
two. _ I 
Judge Tix>mpson’s decision on
the case has also been delayed.
Apparently it will be at least a
month before the final status of the
Phi Kaps and their next-door neigh-
bors, W. Hayden Wilson and Henry
K. Kirk-Patrick, will be determined.
While the decision hangs in the
balance rival attorneys Jarvis and
Ella Graubart must file legal briefs
before the court. ,
The first hearing was caicluded

‘ on Oct. 5 at which Wilson and Kirk-

triieki attempted to have an in-

By belonging to such organiza-
tions as the Middle Atlantic Place-

*ment Officers association he con-

tacts men from other schools and
officers of large companies such as
du Pont, General Electric, and
Westinghouse.

These contacts help Mr. Ebert in
getting companies to send their
jrepresentatives to Pitt to interview
}the graduates.

Preparation Important
Getting a man placed in a job is
not easy according to Mr. Ebert. Pre-
paring the students themselves for
the interview is a large responsi-
bility. I .
Book:-lets and forms are passed
out to graduating men at registra-
tion. The forms are filled 911} and

returned to the bureau to keep in

their files‘for reference when an
employer asks for the names and
qualifications of graduates.

The booklet explains the correct
way to be on the receiving end of
an interview. It explains just what
an employer looks for in a pros-
pective employee.

First Impression Counts

Mr. Ebert says that posture, ap-
pearance and conduct are the first
impression, good or bad, that a
man makes on the interviewer. A
clear and concise story fo exper-
ience and abilities introduces the
the applicant to the employer and he
is judged as much by presentation
as by the story itself.

His advance information on the
company helps the student to be
able to give good reasons why he
would like to work for that parti-
cular organization.

All these things and others that
are just as helpful are explained in
the booklet. After he has studied
the booklet the graduating‘ senior
is ready for the next step, that of
studing the notices of when repres~
tatives of the companies will be at
the school.

Senior Interviews ’

Companies last year that were
represented by an interviewer ,5)-n

companies sent correspondence and
requested that applications be mail-
ed to them.

This year, February graduates
will be interviewed in November_
and December.'June graduates will
be interviewed between March and
May.

Mr. Ebert is now busy directing
the finishing of his eighth floor
offices before the November inva-

sion -of job seekers and employers .

occurs.
And his year-round job of selling

Qn Motor

‘Burbank, California. Evans is a
twenty year old senior in Medical
School.

In an itinerary that included the
-Rocky Mountains, Pikes Peak,
Boulder Dam, and the Utah Desert,
Evans putted and pedaled on the
road for ten days during which he‘
was mistaken for the ocean-to-ocean

icycler of recent headlines.

Troubles Set In

His troubles started to pile up
the first day. Caught between towns
if in territory that he called ‘no man’s
-land-no nothing,’ Evans slosned
“the bike 10 miles through a down-
‘ pour before he reached a garage.

Undaunted he set out the next
morning to motor over Monarch Pass
in the Rockies, an 11,282 foot
climb. The motor, however, didn’t
have the ‘guts.’ He spent over an
if hour pumping the pedals which were
jsupposed to be foot rests as the
motor did the work.

He crossed the boundary into
Utah on Aug. 9 and steamedout
across the Utah Desert. Eight days
after he left Denver, Evans reached
the ‘Glitter City’ of Las Vegas,
1 Nevada. Of this he said, ‘I stayed
as long as my pocketbook held out,’
and added, ‘one afternoon—I won
nothing.’

On Aug. 15 Evans left the Dike‘

topside and toured through the in-
A nards of Boulder Dam. He picked
up the dubiously useful fact that
‘if the waters of Lake Meade behind

burgh they would submerge the en-
‘tire state of Pennsylvania to a
depth of two feet.’

not to cross the desert in the day-

In six more hours he ate up the
remainder of the 270 miles to But-
bank, hitting the city at 4 p.m.
Obviously feeling that he had
traveled far enough for one summer,
Evans was content to ship the bike
back to 136 Birmingham Avenue.
He followed on the t-rain two weeks

Geneva

Tonight  

Pitt’s Jayvees hit the road to-
night in search of their first victory
of the 1949 season. The Geneva
Covenanters of Beaver Falls are
the potential victims. The game will
be played at Reeves Stadium, kick-
off time at 8:30.

The jayvees are anxious to get in-
to the winning column, and look to-
wards Geneva as just the team to
supply them with the needed vic-
:tory. Coach Sager’s squad has im-
proved steadily since their. 12-0
setback at the hands of the Memphis
Hellcats.

The timing and experience, lack-
ing in the first game, may now be
their’s. They feel a win is all that
is needed to get them rolling and
tonight is as good a time as any to
start looking for it. p

A few new faces will feature in
the Panther lineup t0ni»‘-’.ht'. Bob
Fesko, who played admirably de-
fensive all against Memphis, has
been shifted to the starting full-
back post. Frank Altmar has been
given the tailback assignment, and
starting at the right tackle position
is George Ferraro.

Phi Ep and Pi Lam fraternities
battled to a 6-6 tie on Frida after-
noon, after a steady drizze had

thoroughly drenched the field. This
was the first competition for these
two frats who have worked up a
keen rivalry in all sports.
The Pi/Lams entered the game
‘ with a record of three wins and no
losses, while the Phi Eps were
trying to shake loose a two game
losing streak. The tie between the
two teams was the first in eleven
years. a

After blocking a Phi Ep kick,.

Stan Schwartz on a reverse from
Dan Benjamin passed for the first
score. The Phi Eps came charging
back after the kick off with Joe
Miles passing to Cryil Wecht in
the end zone. They missed the con-
version. a

For the next three quarters the
ball moved back and forth between
two stubborn teams. The only other
scoring opportunity was on the Phi
Ep 2-yard line, where the defenders
held. As darkness closed in, the
game ended. '

72-Year-Old Cheers Miami
In Palm Beach Outfit

By JOHN MEGELLA

Pitt followers got a glimpse of Miami University’s most loyal rooter
Saturday afternoon when H. S. Thobe appeared for the Tribe-Pitt game.
The 78-year-old “bricklayer and ballroom dancer” entertained spec-
tators in the process of trying to root Miami to a victory. Before the

game, Thpbe predicted that the
Redskins would win’ by three touch-
downs.

Clad in a Palm Beach suit, white
shoes, and a straw hat, Thobe
roamed theasidelines and urged his
favorites on in an effort to make
good hisprediction. A resident of
Oxford, Ohio, he has been follow-
ing Miami teams for 52 years.

Brandishing a battered mega-
phone and a parasol, he proudly
displayed the seven diamonds that
stud his teeth. Apologetically, he
Claimed, “At one time I had 14
diamonds in my teeth, but things
got tough and I had to pawn a few.”

for his entire team, proclaimed,
“Pont and Bickel were the best
offensive backs on the field.”

Assistant Coach Stub Brickels
backed up Hayes’ statement and
added that Mel Olix’s ball handling
from the quarterback slot had a lot
to do with the effectiveness of the
Tribe’s offensive attack.

Hayes found some comfort in de-
feat when he looked over the sta-
tistics. The Redskins gained 44”"/'
yards, 260 rushing and 178 pass-
ing. He said, "That's more yardage
than William and Mary, Northwest-

to rest in his backs. Nick Sebek

AN ANNOUNCER MUSES

As I spent a few days resting
With a chance to dream a bit,
I had visions of the season

And the onward march of Pitt.

Saw the fangs again a’clawing

And the Panthers decked in gold, _
Snarling challenge east andwestward,
Paying back the scores of old!

In my dreams I saw Cecconi,
Jackpot runner in the clutch,
Cut back for vital touchdowns
 ' Just too sharpto even touch.

 

Little “go-guyi’ also faked it,

Then gave off to Jimmy Joe

A reverse that ate up yardage;
I How that Robinson did go!

 

On those plays a’blocking cleanly
Straight ahead came Bobby Lee,
Taking out the enemy backers

So the halves could "Haw” or ‘ 'Gee.”

  

But the ball was ‘not all Pittsburgh's
And the defense gave and gave

Till DePasqua grabbed a forward‘
And roared back the game to save.

Lenny Radnor grabbed the fumble
Caused by Pitt’s terrific guard.
Nick DeRosa caught a high one,
Ted Geremsky got one wide;
Boldin blocked his man superbly
As the Panthers turned the tide.

So I visioned all the Panthers

As Pitt’s Trampling Single Wing
Drove for yardage and for touchdowns
While the cheers of old did ring.

Oh, Colder: Roster of the Unbeaten,
Storied gridiron map of might,
Topped by Pittsburgh’s brilliant

warriors
Just a dream —— or was I right?

Friday: “Pitt’s Two lmps”

"Big Nick” booted and he made it,
Then kicked off both high and deep-‘,
Bobby Plotz sped downfield quickly,
'; Smashed the runner in a heap.‘

Then Barkouskie chased the passer,’
Set him back and down and hard;

F rosh Meet

W&J Here
Saturday

When the University of Pittsburgh
fields its freshman team against
the Washington and Jefferson frosh
this Saturday, it will mark the first
time since 1938 that the Pitt first
year men will engage in intercol-
legiate competition.

Working out of the traditional Pitt
single wing, Head Coach Ted
Schmitt will send his team out
against an already battle-tried op-
ponent. The W&J eleven lost to
Kiski prep, 7-0, and have beaten
California?s reserves, 20-13.

In order to make a successful
showing, Schmitt has,iover the four
week training period, stressed con-
ditioning and play perfection.

W&J coach Paul Reardon has
some promising local talent on his
squad. Most prominent is Stan
Hoover, an all-WPI‘AL center at
Wilkinsburg. Others from the Pitts-
burgh district are Earle Albee,
guard, Jim Proie, end, and Cliff
Hargest, halfback.

An interesting battle may deve-
lop between some former Donora
stars. While the majority of Jim
Russell’s team came to Pitt, his
star triple threat quarterback, Don
Puglisi, enrolled at W&J. Puglisi
will face old teammates Tony
Romantino, Gabriel Gembaroskya
and Warren Walton this Saturday.

Admission to the game will be
with student activity cards.

Harriers Coast
To Victory

By SAM SPATTER

Carl Olson's cross country squad
scored an easy victo-ry Saturday in
a triangular meet at Schenley Park
with Geneva and Westrhinister when
the Panthers’ entire team romped
home "before one visitor finished.
Pitt’s first six men broke the
tape together at 25:36 while her
seventh harrier, Jay Neilson, was
only 7 seconds behind. Crossing
first, hand-in-hand, were Ed Berman,
Frank Kuzma, Ken Mahanna, Jack
McMahon, Ted Zatkovich, and John
"Red" Weigel.

Geneva’s J. Steel followed Neil-
son across the line but the Covies

 were last in the meet. The score

showed Pittiwith I5, Westminister
59, and Geneva 66.

Berman, Mahanna, McMahon, and
Weigel paced the harriers through-
out the course. At no time did a
visitor forge into the lead.
Western Reserve will meet Pitt
in a dual meet here Saturday at

When Hardisty punted one for 47
yards in the third quarter, a Miami
female cheerleader said to one of
the Pitt equipment managers, “He

on a 19-yard pass with four minutes
to play in the game that Pitt and
its followers could breathe easily.

Up to that point Olix and Pont
had the Panthers reeling.

Pont, the best runner the Jungle
Cats have faced all year, scored
three TD’s, one on an aerial from
Olix who passed and faked beauti-
fully all afternoon. Jack Bickel
accounted for the other Miami score
on a 79-yard gallop with George
Galat tacking on two extra points.

For the Panthers, it was once
again Bimbo Cecconi and Jimmy
Joe Robinson doing the heavy
work.

The Pitt halfbacks both scored
twice. Cecconi on runs of four and
thirteen yards and Robinson on a
75-yard jaunt and a 26-yard pass
from Bimbo. Nick Bolkavac had a
perfect day on extra-points, boot-
ing five between the bars.

No "Wayfaring stranger,” Pitt’s
only folk singer, Vivien Richman
is becoming better known through-
out the tri—state area as a popular
singing lady. With her guitar, she
is helping to revive an apprecia-
tion of folk songs.

It all started in her home town,
New York City, where she was
charmed by the art of such folk
singers as Woody Guthrie, Cisco
Houston, Tom Glazer, josh White,
and Pete Seeger. She obtained a
guitar and taught herself to strum
a few chords on it.

Then she started learning folk
songs. From the meager anthologies
then available, from the profess-
ional folk song artists that she
knew, and from the few records
that she could find, she began to»
build her repertoire.

Takes to the [fills
But learning folk songs vicar-
iously didn’t satisfy Vivien Rich-
man. Armed with a wire recorder,

in

she began making trips into the
hills and fields of the country to
learn more songs directly from the
folks who’ve been singing them for
generations.

“The more songs I learned, the
more I realized the honest beauty
which has made these songs death-
less,” she said. “I’m still learn-
ing new ones. The supply seems to
be unlimitedu” Her repertoire in-
cludes over 300 folk songs in
seven languages.

Vivien’s inquiries into the art of
folksinging have made her a recog-
nized authority, She will conduct a
series of six illustrated lectures
at the Isaac Seder Educational
Center in the YI23-\X’HA on the de-

velopment and analysis of folk

She will also appear at a special

Since she came to Pittsburgh,
Vivien has been charming audi-
ences in solo programs for church
socials, club parties, banquets,

where people want to be entertain-
