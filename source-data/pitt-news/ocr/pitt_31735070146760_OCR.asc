sleep on the streets of Pittsburgh. Tonight,
that number willclimb to over 400.

The jump will come as local advocacy
group Community Human Services Cor-
poration hosts its annual Sleep,-In for the
Homeless on the stepsohf the City-County
Building, Downtown, from 6:30 p.m. Fri-
day to 6:30 a.m. Saturday. V I

ganizers hope the event will spread aware-
, ness about the issues of homelessness and

substandard housing in Pittsburgh.
There are currently about 2,500 people
receiving homeless beneﬁts in Allegheny
County, with about 120 who are consis-
tently unsheltered, according toa recent
study conducted by the county’s Depart-
ment of Human Services. ' '
' l Steiber was one of few Pittvolunteers
to participate in the sleep-in last year.

1 “It was really disappointing actually, ‘

because Pittis one of the largest sponsors
of this event,” she said. “Living in‘Oak-
land, I think a lot of students get kind of
jaded with the homelessness issue. We see

is given to student leaders from local uni-A

their life efforts to building student leader-

ing,” according to the group’s website.‘

“Molly has donetremendous work for-

Pitt rises
in safe sex

  rankings

Olivia Garber

Assistant News Editor

Pitt students aren’tjust having sex —— they’re
getting better at it, too. .
Trojan Condoms released its annual Sexu

Health Report Card yesterday. The company
ranked Pitt 21st in terms of sexual-health re-
sources and information services out of 141
colleges from the-Bowl Championship Series

‘ system — a‘54—spot jump that earned Pitt the

title of “Most Improved Player.”
Jumpingfrom last year’s 75th ranking, Pitt’s
2.91 Sexual Health GPA placed it in the top

quarter of sexually healthy colleges.

. Columbia University took top honors as
the most sexually health campus in 2010, after
ranking fourth last year. 1

Michigan State University, Ohio State Uni-
versity, University of Michigan—Ann Arbor and
Brown University rounded "out the top ﬁve’.
Trojan did not rank any other universities
from Pittsburgh. Penn State University and
West Virginia University both ranked higher
than Pitt, 14th and 15th respectively.
The condom manufacturer graded colleges
on 12 categories, including contraceptive and

condom availability and cost, HIV and STI,$

testing and availability of sexual—assault pre-
vention and recovery programs.

they will consider volunteering some other
time. We’re nothing without volunteers.”

During the event, volunteers will host
tours of the Severe_Weather Emergency
Shelter on Smithﬁeld Street, Downtown.
Participants will also tour a number of un-
derpasses around the city, where plaques
are mounted to commemorate homeless
people whohave died.

“We’re going to bunk up around 11 p.m.
and sleep as best we can overnight,” Mc-
Mahon said.

McMahon expects a number of home-
less Pittsburghers to join the sleep—in on the

stairs of the City-County Building, though"

she is not sure how many might show up.

“It can be surprising for the homeless
population to see an event like this,” she
said. “Normally they are getting chased
oﬁ' private property by police and secu-
rity guards, and they are forced to sleep in
more reclusive places like back allies and
beneath bridges. We hope that they will
feel welcome.” .

The group has presented information at
the past three SGB meetings, encouraging
students to donate and volunteer.

“A lot of these issues are a matter of
awareness,” McMahon said. “College stu-
dents have the energy and know-how to
really help out.” p

McMahon said her organization works
in close conjunction with Allegheny Coun-
ty’s Department of Human Services to de-
liver beneﬁts to the homeless population.

Michael Lindsay, housing program
administrator for the department, said
Allegheny, County receives $15.5 million
per year to combat homelessness.

A vast majority of that funding — up to
$13.2 million — comes from the federal
government, he said. The remaining funds
come from local and state governments
and taxes.

“Homelessness is an extremely com-
plex issue, but we have a large number of
resources here in Pittsburgh and Allegheny
County,” Lindsay said.

He said one of the most alarming as-
pects of his job involves child homeless-
ness. There are currently about 875 home-
less children in and around the city, he

i said

“Of course, a vast majority of these kids
and their families are utilizing the services
we provide, whether it be transitional hous-
ing or subsidized apartments,” Lindsay
said. “Still, the uncertainty and the threat
of homelessness is not something children
should have to deal with.” 1

Back on campus, Stieber shared an an-
ecdote that she said sums up the goals of
the sleep—in. _

“Last year, we toured the area beneath
one of the bridges, and we saw a group of
people huddled together trying to sleep,”
Stieber said. “We brought them food and
extra clothes, and they were so thankful.
Students need to see what it’s really like to
live on the street. It’s very humbling.” j

Law students auction dates, prizes for memorial

Olivia Garber
Assistant News Editor

Pitt law students gathered last night for a
date auction to raise money for slain class-
matejames Wallmuth'III, who died this sum-
mer after a shooting in his hometown of
York, Pa.

Law fraternity Phi Alpha Delta hosted the
auction, where bidders purchased combina-

Last night’s auction was the second char-

since Wallmuth’sdeath. Last month, friends

honor, he added. , ’

Pietranton was auctioned along with a pair
of tickets to a Penguins hockey game. She

. said most people don’t.bid for the date —

they want the various items donated by local
organizations;

Even though the event was only open
to law students, every chair in the room
was ﬁlled. Attendees paid $10 for a yellow
bracelet and pizza and beer in the back of

V the building. Pop music pumped from the

sound system decorated with yellow and
purple balloons, while law students nursed
keg beer in blue plastic cups.

They raised their plastic cups and
cheered when Rambin — the night’s
auctioneer»— got on stage and announced
that the proceeds would go to Wallmuth’s
scholarship fund.

Rambin, along with a.$100 bar tab to a ,

South Oakland bar, was later sold for $200.
He estimated the fraternity raised about
$1,000 forlthe scholarship fund.

LeMont Restaurant, the Carnegie Science
Center and ScareHouse were just a few orga-
nizations that contributed to the event.

Rambin said that Pitt donated the venue
for the event. The University also held a
memorial service earlier in the semester.

“They’ve deﬁnitely done their part for
us,” he said.

Some of Wallmuth’s former classmates

' . expressed their desire to contribute to his _

legacy. . ~
“Jimmy was a really great person. Any-
thing we can do to donate to the fund, we
deﬁnitely want. to help,” Phi Alpha Delta
member Lisa Howell said. ll
She said she was in the same class sec-
tion as Wallmuth, which meant she spent
almost everyday with him during the school
year. . — .
Sam Stein was also in the same section
as Wallmuth. The second-year law student
and tickets to the Pittsburgh Zoo were for

- sale last night.

Starting at $40, Stein wasn’t too excited
about his value and petitioned for ways to
boost his price —— all unsuccessfully.

“Brian [Rambin] said I couldn’t take my
shirt off,” he joked. , '

The playful demeanor faded when he
mentioned his deceased classmate.

“James and I had all our classestogether.’ A
. This is great, what everyone is doing,” he
' said. v

Stein said he was studying in Europe
when he heard the news about Wallmuth’s
passing and called it the “worst thing.
ever.” ' "

Rambin. said he doesn’t plan to do more

, events later in the year, but hopes to con-

tinue the tradition of donating money to

l the scholarship fund. A
“It’s the thing we can do that’s the most I

proactive,” he said. . _
Three teenagers have been charged in re-

lation to the shooting death of Wallmuth.]

Candidates reach for youth

Michael Macagnone
News Editor

It’s almost mid-term election time, and political
campaigns across the state have takentovisiting
college campuses inanattemptto attract student
voters.

Both gubernatorial candidateswill hold events
this weekend geared toward college students, one
in Pittsburgh and the other at Penn State. Next
week, several candidates and campaign represen-
tatives will attend a “Candidate Carnival” at Pitt.

Matthew Morrison —— who plays Mr. Shuester
on the popularTV show “Glee” — will stump for
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dan Onorato
at Hamburg Hall on CMU’s campus tomorrow,
starting at 2 p.m.

Onorato’s Communications Director Brian
Herman said that the event with Morrison is
just one part of their efforts to reach college—age
students.

“Its not justvote—getting,” Herman said. “Stu-
dents interning andvolunteering are essential to
the campaign.”

Republican candidate and state Attorney Gen-
eral Tom Corbett will rub elbows with students
and alumni atthe tailgate for Penn State’s football
game this Saturday.

There won’t be any of the usual pre—game

drinkers at the Corbett event, though. Corbett’s '

press secretary, Kirsten Page, said itwillonly serve
water and snacks. She said the event would be a
chance forCor‘bettto meet supporters “in amore
relaxed and ﬁm environmen ”

Next Monday at 11:30 a.m.,]oe Sestak will
visit the Barco Law Building for a speech on the
“American Dream.”

As oflastweek, outreach efforts on Pitt’s cam-
pus had resultedinthe registration of about2,0oo
voters since the start of school, said to Miller Nut-
tle, afull—t1'me organizer with the Sierra Club.

The Sierra Club organized a series of non-
partisan get- out—the—vote efforts at various Pitts-

burgh campuses, including Carnegie Mellon and

Duquesne. '
Nuttle said that once the deadline passed th
organization would focus on things like getting
students to sign pledges to vote.
Since the Oct. 4 voter registration deadline
has passed, many get-out—the—vote organiza-

tions across the state have switched their focus .

to motivating registered voters to hit the polls
on election day

Terry Madonna, apublic affairs professor and
pollster at Franklin 8: Marshall College, said that
the rationale for student outreach lies intl1e2O08
election results.

Even though youthvoter t11rnoutin20o8 was
not remarkably high, Madonna said the decisions
those voters made at the polls seemed remark-

False fire call at UPMC

Michael Macagnone
News Editor

Afalseﬁrecall atUPMC blocked trafﬁc on Lothrop
Street for more than halfan hour last night.
Battalion Chief Gary Walz called last night’s
action a “ ood intentions check,” because there
was no ﬁre. He said that “basically nothing” hap-
pened, despite areport that someone told police
they saw aﬁre on top of a building near the inter-
section of Fifth Avenue and Lothrop Street.
Walz said the “ﬁre” a caller reportedwas likely

steam releasing from the hospital’s incinerator. ,

No alarms had been triggered at the Biomedical

Science Tower or UPMC Presbyterian Hospital,
where police and ﬁreﬁghters originally respond~
ed just before 7 p.m.

Fireﬁghters opened up two ﬁre hydrants on
Lothrop Street while others searched for a ﬁre.

Pitt police blocked traﬁic on Lothrop Street
about7p.m. for more than half an hour while six
engines from the city ﬁre department checked
the Biomedical Science Tower.

The mood at the scene remained largely
relaxed, despite the presence of ﬁre and police
vehicles. Many people watched the ﬁreﬁghters
work from the sidewalk across the street. A few
observers smoked cigarettes. I

To the Editor,

Thank you for publishing an article last

adoptive families and their birth fami-
lies — and that is related to legislation
pending in Pennsylvania. '
As the article noted, state statutes
establishing a process for adopting chil-
~ dren began to be passed in the mid-
19th century and were enacted in all
the states by the 1920s.
States in the 19305 began to provide

children, which replaced the children’s
original certificates.

By the late 1940s, in most states
an adopted child could be issued an
amended certificate that substituted his '
adoptive parents’ names for his birth
parents’ names.

It was not until much later in most
states — 1984 in'Pennsylvania —— that
adult adoptees lost the right to see their
original birth certificates. In recent
years, as the article noted, a number of
states have passed laws reestablishing
that right.

Sincerely yours,

One day in late September, my room-_

months was on the. list.
. “This is your chance!” I exclaimed.
“Better put your TOMS onl”

‘-‘He’s so cute, but what am I even going

asked. “I don’t volunteer!” _

“Tell him you buy organic eggs or some-

ing about children; volunteerism and the A
greater good. But at some point the con-
versationfaltered and thenlﬁz-zled; the
handsome humanitarian abruptly turned

away from Amelia, and she sidled away

into another side of the room. I
I asked her what happened.

“Nothing!” she said. “But that was 
problem! The conversation just never
moved on — all he wanted to talk about’
was tutoring children, and, I mean, ‘that’s
great but I don’t really care about that
stuff. When I go to a party, I just wanna
talk about the last moviell sawi’ 5 ,

Earlier that week I‘ was talking to my
friend, a Ph.D. candidate in Pitt’s chem-
istry department, about a concept called
click chemistry. According to him, click
chemistry involves using elements’ natu-
ral properties to create a reaction. Unlike
most chemical compounds, joining natu-
rally reacting elements doesn’t require a
typical catalyst. And, unlike catalyzed re-
actions,‘reactions‘produced through click

 

I chemistry are more mild and more energy

efﬁcient. They are also more reliable. In a

. nutshell, click chemistry takes two things
. . ,1.‘ that really want to react to one another and

allows them to do their natural thing.
As Amelia told me her story, I couldn’t

' help but think about my conversation with
 my Ph.D.-candidate friend. Faraway crush-
es are entertaining because our fantasies _

don’t involve conversation. Meeting the

Acrush in real life is bound to disappoint
 because we’ve built them up in our heads.

-If we’ve already constructed an idea of
who the person is, and what he’ll want
to talk about, there’s little opportunity
for chemistry and little opportunity for a

-conversation to naturally click.

Widespread addiction to social media

_ sites kills click chemistry because it gives

the most basic of impressions, barely skim-
ming the surface of a person’s identity. We
take the catalysts we accumulate from re-
search — an interest in tutoring children,
for instance — and use that information to
prompt a conversation, rather than letting
the interaction occur organically. '
We shouldn’t be surprised when our
synthesized conversations don’t produce
the best reactions. What’s more, a party
is probably the worst place to have expec-
tations about our téte-a-tétes. The best
conversations are about whatever happens
to pop into your head at the time. It dem-
onstrates what kind of person you really
are, the way your brain works and what

"you really love. Planned—'corivers‘ations only

work on the TV or movie screen. In life we
aren’t really allowed to carry a script. And
we will never know ahead of time what a

‘person wants to hear about. “ I

If you see your faraway crush in person,
it’s probably best to pretend you don’t
know anything about them. Instead of
cornering yourself in a one-dimensional
dialogue, go ahead and ask what movie
he saw last. At ‘least it will be real, and
you won’t have to feign a die—hard inter-
est in a topic you don’t really care that
much about. . ’.

And if you don’t even really want to
know what his favorite band i_s, you know
you’re talking to the wrong person after
all. Not just any elements will make a
good click-chemistry pair. And not every
conversation, however organic, is worth
continuing. _ . -

tarian sent out a Facebook friend request

I Bone Thugs-N-Harmony

Mr. Small’s Theatre
‘Saturday at 8 p.m.
Tickets $25
412-821-4447

Some people learn music through school, some

through informal lessons, but for Bone Thugs— _

N-Harmony’s Wish Bone, it ran in the family.
“A lot of our people did the doo-wop thing,”
he said. “All our parents would get together and
do that  when the rap thing came around, We
used to do our little interpretations of groups
that were out. We just spilled our spiel  that
was the way we went.” _
Thefamous Midwestern‘hip—hop group will

. bring its tradition of family music to Mr. Small’s

Theatre on Saturday, albeit with a slightly dif-
ferent family.

Composed of core MCs Krayzie, Layzie, '

Bizzy, Wish and occasional supporting member
Flesh—n — all with the surname “Bone” —
the group auditioned its smooth and melodic
rhymes for N.W.A. founder Eazy-E while he
was performing in Cleveland in 1993. After
being signed to Eazy’s Ruthless Records, the
four quickly introduced the world to one of
the most unique lyrical styles in rap.

“Their distinctive ﬂow and style  their.

whole sound is just incredible,” MH the _Verb,
leader of the Pittsburgh hip—hop collaboration

known as the BNVZ, saidgwhile talking, about 4

his musical inﬂuences. 

A number of collaborations that Wish
Bone cites as integral to the Bone Thugs-N-
Harmony discography have been particularly
inﬂuential. ' ‘

“Eazy~E, Biggie Smalls, ]am—Master Jay,
Tupac  those guys stand out because they’re
no longer with us,” he said. “Those projects
are things that can never be done again  be-
ing able to make everlasting music with them

‘ was a blessing.” _

A collaborative spirit alsoexists within the

group itself: Every member contributes to the

songwriting. »
“Sometimes we get a beat and get in a circle

and figure out what we want the song to be -

about,” Wish Bone said. “[Then] somebody
might come up with the hook, either Krayzie
or me, and we all add to it to build the song and
then we write it out.” .

With some producers, the group changes
strategies and “works it out” from their idea.

for you Saturday..
The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust’s Second

Saturday Workshop will host the ﬁrst-ever V

Pittsburgh Sketch Crawlthis Saturday. Artists
of all skill levels can sketch some of the city’s
most scenic areas, including Katz ‘Plaza, the
Andy Warhol Bridge and Market Square.
Sonja Sweterlitsch, event planner and com-
munity art manager for the Second Saturday
Workshop, said the goal of the event is to en-
courage any and all artists, be they studied
pros or just people who like to doodle, to come

"out and be “creative together, meet other art-
ists and depict the beauty of the city.” ~.-.A.

Over the course of the day, artists will head
to four different locations in the Downtown
area, staying at each one for less than two
hours. For the last hour, artists are encouraged
to head to any area they choose and sketch
what they see. Sketchers can choose to have

their pieces shown in an exhibition during the M

Downtown First Night celebration on New
Year’s Eve. ' 4
“These are excellent places to sit and draw,”
Sweterlitsch said of the Downtown locations.
“The scenery is varied and beautiful. There

are many other great places to sit and ‘drawn

Staﬁ Writer

“Life as We Know It”

‘I ’“ Director: Greg Berlanti

Starring: Katherine Heigl, josh Duhamel,
Josh Lucas I I

Warner Bros. Pictures

Grade: C-

Boy meets girl. Boy disgusts girl. Boy, by the
end of two hours, makes girl fall in love with
him.

This is the premise of nearly every Kath-
erine Heigl movie to date. “Life as We Know
It” — the most recent addition to the Heigl
romantic—comedy canon — is no different.

' The ﬁlm is no more than a compilation of
her previous three productions, each tellingly
less successful than the last. We have baby
complications a la Knocked Up (2007), the
hopeless search for Mr. Right 21 la 27 Dresses
(2008) and the abrasive marmerisms of a male
co—star a la The Ugly Truth (2009).

In “Life as We Know It,” Holly (Heigl) and
Messer (josh Duhamel) are thrown together
to care for an orphaned child after their mu-
tual best friends die in a car accident. As time

passes, caring for the baby softens Holly’s .
3 '_‘__controlling personality and puts Messer’s

desire for eternal bachelorhood on the back
burner.

The result? Trust me, you already know.

Despite the ﬁlm’s predictability, the two
hours aren’t a complete waste of time. Du-
hamel, somewhat of a new face in the rom—com
male lead role — nobody actually remembers
“Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!” — is a breath
of fresh air after years of the same perfor-
mances by a smarmy Matthew Mcconaughey
or an aging Hugh Grant. His face isn’t just nice
to look at — he actually manages to bring some

. hint of chemistry to the screen.

The same cannot be said for Heigl, who year
after year continues unconvincingly to play a
gorgeous woman unable to land a boyfriend.
Frankly, I’m tired of her gig as the Type A dam-
sel in distress whose performances exhibit
little to no connection with her co-stars.

Of course, Heigl has come a long way since
her iconic buttocks-baring debut in the 1993

. ﬁlm “My Father the Hero.” She’s ﬁrmly estab-

lished herself in the genre once dominated
byjennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon,
the latter of whom had the grace to walk away
from roles more suited to younger Hollywood
actresses. ‘

- But audiences can only handle so much
repetition. Unless Heigl can step beyond her
typecast role and recent dubbing as the new
diva of Hollywood, I doubt it will be long

before the rom—coms oust her for a younger

By the looks of her proﬁle on IMDb.com,
however, it seems 2011 will bring yet another

A With either method, however, Wish Bone

stressed that, for Bone Thugs—N-Harmony,
“All the music comes from the heart.”

That heart comes across particularly strong
onstage, a place Wish Bone cites as essential
to the musical experience.

“I think the best way to hear music is to
study it and then go to see the performer live
and learn what kind of person they are from
your perspective in the audience,” he said.

In addition to experiencing Krayzie, Layzie,
Bizzy and Wish as they’re heard on their al-

bums, those who stop by any of the concerts

on their current tourwill see the group backed
by something quite different than the tradi-
tional D]. V '

said. “A lot of the instruments are going to be

on the record. You get more of the music with
a live band. It’s a totally different look and
sound.” ’ V

Though the band’s live sound might be a
little different from that of its album releases,
Wish Bone hopes both versions will reach out
to fans. A

“It’s not always about what you can gain
from it,” he said. “I love when people come up

to us and tell us ‘this song helped me overcome  ;

something.’’’ .

The group’s uplifting brand of hip—hop
might seem a pure extract of the genre’s golden
age, but Wish Bone said there are still a few

With its many different architectural styles,
Downtown, at face level, doesn’t present a
uniﬁed aesthetic. But Sweterlitsch thinks this
variation is to the participants’ advantage.

“Downtown Pittsburgh has so many great
places to draw,” she said. “From the beauti-
ful magnolia-tree sculptures and the Louise
Bourgeois sculptures at Katz Plaza to the col-
orful facades of Market Square and the regal
spires of PPG.”

Sweterlitsch and Antolic said the Down-
town area is ideal for an event like this because
the locations are all very diverse but are all
in~close proximity to one another — a vital
dynamic for a successful crawl.

“Pittsburgh is a ‘walking town.’ Regardless
of whether people have an automobile or not,
it seems everyone in Pittsburgh enjoys walk-
ing in and around the city. This allows smaller
business, such as low-budget art galleries, to
survive,” Antolic said.

Antolic added that the growing Pittsburgh
art scene makes an event like this all the more
feasible and interesting.

In their last two meetings, Brian Kelly got the
better ofPittas the Panthers and conference foe
Cincinnati battled for Big ‘East championships.
The Panthers hope that the outcome will be
differentthis week when they take on Kelly dur-
ing his ﬁrst year as coach of the Fighting Irish.
Pitt (2-2) will hit the road to travel to South

‘T * Bend, Ind., where theywillface afamiliarenemy

in Notre Dame for the 66th time tomorrow at
3:30 p.m. at Notre Dame Stadium.

F It has been anup-and-down yearfor the Irish,
to say the least, but the team has still not lived up
to the hype that surrounded it when Kelly ﬁrst
arrived. Upon Kelly’s hiring, he gave a speech
about his and the tearn’s expectations to win, but
that hasn’t gone quite according to plan.

The Irish (2-3) have lost three of their last
ﬁve games. The team started off with awin over
in—state rival Purdue. Then it suffered a loss to
Michigan and quarterback Denard Robinson and

W" lost in a shocker to Michigan State in overtime

on a fake ﬁeld goal that occurred just moments
before Michigan State head coach Mark Dantonio
had a heart attack. (Dantonio survived.)

The Irish then struggled at home against a
ranked Stanford team, losing 37-14, before pro-
ceeding to dismantle Boston College at home.

The Panthers might not have had-great suc-
cess against teams coached by Kelly, but Pitt has

had some recent success against the Irish and ‘

is looking to snag its third straight win at Notre
Dame Stadium. Pitt has won three ofthe last four

T _ meetings with the Irish.

The Panthers hope to continue their success
with the ground game against the Irish, which
has mainly been through Ray Graham. Graham
was the recent recipient of the Big East Offensive
Player of the Week title for his efforts againstFIU
last weekend.

After limited appearances, Graham is now the
nation’s third—leading nisher in terms of yards
per game with a164 average overthree contests
and is second in terms of yards per attemptwith
a 9.5 average.

Absent in the FIU game was backﬁeld-mate

is expected to play this week after being held
out due to an injury. Lewis is still the starter, but
Wannstedt assured fans that both backs will get
plenty of carries.

MEN’S soeclan

Panthers
lose onthe
road again  

Greg Trietley
Senior Staff Writer

The road /woes of the Pitt men’s soccer team
continued Wednesday night — this time in
Cleveland.

The Cleveland State Vikings beat Pitt -2-0
at Krenzler Field and dropped the Panthers’
record outside of Allegheny County to 0-4-1
and 5-4-1 overall.

Head coachjoe Luxbacher, whose team is 5-0
at home, couldn’t explain why Pitt’s level of play
drops so much on the road, but he acknowledged
that travel has to affect it. ,

“There’s obviously something behind that,”
he said. “But I can’t put my ﬁnger on it right now,
other than the fact that we’ve played some pretty
good teams.”

Luxbacher said he has tried to ﬁnd a travel
schedule that the players respond to on the ﬁeld,
but so far he has been unsuccessful.

“Some of the away games, like against Seton
Hall, you get there two days or a day early and
you just sit there,” he said. “We just got [to Kren-
zler Field] late -— right before the game, trying
to get to the locker room, changed and ready
for warm—up. We didn’t have any time sitting [in
Cleveland], thinking that might be it, but again,
we didn’t get it done.” ’

SeniorAlex Betancourt said lengthy bus trips
wear down the team.

“Traveling has taken a little toll on the team
so far,” he said. “Everyone’s alittle sore sitting on
buses for six hours at/atime, but otherteams also
get pumped up a little more playing at home.”

Whether or not travelwas to blame, Pitt
struggled out of the gate against the Vikings.
Cleveland State took it to Pitt early, outshooting
the Panthers, 7-1, in the ﬁrst half. ’

“[Slow starts] are somethingwe’ve been hav-
ing some trouble with,” Betancourt said. “When

. we wereinthe WestVirginia tournament, inboth

games that we lost 2-0 they scored within the
ﬁrst 20 minutes or halflhour. The same thing
happened yesterday.” » «

Big East play set to begin

Donnie Tasser
Staﬁ” Writer

 

Well, the Big East didn’t do too poorly this past
week, but the teams didn’t play anybody notable.
West Virginia, Cincinnati and Syracuse were
off, Pitt looked shaky until the fourth quarter,
Louisville looked shaky inthe fourth quarter, and
Connecticut and South Florida dominated. Oh,
and Rutgers still can’t score — which it showed
in its disappointing loss to Tulane, of all teams.
That’s the rundown, so here are this week’s power
rankings.

1. West Virginia _— The Mountaineers have
done nothingto remove themselves from the top
of the class. It has been the most consistent team
— scratch that, the only consistent team‘— in
the conference thus far. Noel Devine has a foot
injury that could hamper him, but nobody right
now is in a position to challenge WVU.

2. Connecticut—Its running game has been
solid, but its quarterback play has been anything
but. The Huskies haven’t beaten any good teams,
but with Cody Endres now under center, their
offense looks much better than it did at the be-
ginning of the year. A

_ 3. South Florida — The Bulls are 3-1, but at
times have struggled to ﬁnd their groove on of-
fense. They played well lastweek, as B._]. Daniels

was 14for 19 for 155 yards and atouchdown and 7
. the defense allowed only 1.8 yards per rush in a

blowout win over a bad Florida Atlantic team.
~ 4. Cincinnati —— The Bearcats are at No. 4
afterabye week, only because they played much
better in a loss to Oklahoma than they had all
season. This week they look to carry momen-
tum in what should be an easy victory against
Miami (OH). At 1-3, they need awin to get back
on track. ,
5. Pittsburgh — Florida International is not

that good of a team, and Pitt led only 16-10 at the
start of the fourth quarter. But the line looked
much improved — as evidenced by Ray Graham’s
monster performance of 277 rushing yards and
three touchdowns -- but the passing game still.
needs to ﬁnd its groove. Tino Sunseri and Jon
Baldwin need to get in sync with each other be-
fore the Panthers start conference play.

6. Syracuse — The Orange are 3-1, but have
beaten some pretty poor opponents, so I’m still
not sold on them. They play South Florida this
week, and a win could show that they are for
real. But I’m not convinced they are.

7. Rutgers —— Its defense and special teams
are the class of the conference, but its offense

is absolutely terrible. Now Tom Savage is hurt, p

which means it might only get worse — or per-
haps it could be a blessing in disguise. I think
it should just run the Vlfrldcat every play with
Mohamed Sanu, as he is its only real offensive
threat. ' A I _ if

4 8‘. Louisville — Behind starting quarterback
Adam Froman — who leads the conference in
total offense — the Cardinals are playingbetter
at thispoint than anyone expected. But they re-
main in the basement because I.still don’tthink
they could beat another Big East team.

This week, conference play gets under way
with Connecticut facing off with Rutgers in Pis-
cataway, N.]., and Syracuse traveling to South
Florida to play the Bulls. Pitt, WVU, Cincinnati
and'Louisvilleallhave non-conference games, so
every Big East team is in action this weekend.

— Connecticut at Rutgers — This should be as
thrilling as they come, at least for the Big East
this year. UConn’s ground game -—- led by the
Big East’s leading rusherjordan Todman — will
face offwithatough Rutgers defense ledby safety
Joe Lefeged. Rutgers will remain in this game
by virtue of its defense, but its putrid offense is

said. “There’s no more humble player on our
team. Their relationship is good — but at the
same time -they’re both going to be anxiously
wanting the football come Saturday.”

Headed by ﬁrst-year starting junior quar-
terback Dayne Crist, the Irish offense has found
some success through the air at times but hopes
to continue the progress it has made on the
ground with senior tailback Armando Allen.

AlthoughAllen might nothave the yards that
Graham has, he is aworkhorse and a key player
out ofthe backﬁeld. In his press conference Kelly
praised Allen’s play up to this point.

“Armando Allenhasbeenprobably ourplay-
maker-if you look at everything that hes done

p in terms of running and catching, and if you
continue to give us Armando Allen, we’re going .

to continue to take him,” Kelly said.’
, .. Besides Allen, the Irish have no shortage of

valuable weapons on offense. They have one
of the top —- if not the top — tight ends in the
nation in Kyle Rudolph. Rudolph and wide re-

ceiver Michael Floyd were named as preseason

All-Americans and-are likely ﬁrst--or second-
round draftpicks. ‘ v

. The nationally televised gamewillbe an op-
portunity for the Panthers to show that their
season is back on track. Like it or not, playing

Notre Dame is a big deal and will generate a lot _

of attention for a team that has looked average
at best this far into the season.

Whether it is Lewis or Graham, the Panthers
need a strong running attack to open up the
passing game for Sunseri and take pressure off
an offensive line that has struggled.

Needless to say, this game will say a lot as
to where the team is headed for the rest of the
season.I.........

Pitt will win close game

Tasser < 13

going to have to make a play if it wants to win. '1
just can’t see the Rutgers offensive line —— which
is horrendous — being able to come through.
Defense always gives you a chance, butthis game
should go to the Huskies by a touchdown.

Pitt at N otre Dame —— This is abig non—con-
ference game for the Big East. If Pitt can pull this
one off and get revenge‘ on former Cincinnati
coach Brian Kelly, it could do wonders for the
conference. The shuffling of the offensive line
was effective against FIU, but will it be against
the Irish? Maybe, but with Graham getting ex-
tra attention after his big game last week, Dion
Lewis might ﬁnd some space to run. The defense
will once again be presented with its kryptonite
— the spread offense— but I think it will do
better now that safety Dom DeCicco is playing
linebacker. His coverage skills will help to take
away the underneath passes, which have killed
the Panthers this year. I’rn saying that Pitt will

win a tight one, which has been the trend with
these two teams of late.

Offensive Player of the Week: Ray Graham,
PittRB . "

Grahamhad a career day starting in place
of the injured Dion Lewis. His ﬁnal stat line
read 277 yards rushing on 29 carries with three
touchdowns, and he also caught three passes
for 19 yards.

Defensive Player of the Week: Blidi Wreh—
Wilson, UConn CB A

Wreh—W1lson'notched a44-yard interception
returnforaTD forhis second—straightweekwith
a pick six. He also recovered a fumble.

That’s it for another edition of the Big East ’

Breakdown. Now that October is starting, we
can all forget about that horrendous month of
September.

Lack of offense, injuries hurt Panthers

Men’s soccer 4 12

Matt Aberegg misjudged his free kick. Aberegg
came out too far and the ball — intended as a
chance for a Viking header — sailed over him
into the goal. ‘ "

Despite the error, Luxbacher said his goal-
keeper played well in his ﬁrst career Pitt start.

“He misplayed one ball, but he made a couple
good saves early,” he said. 1 .

Aberegg made four saves in place of Harm
Kara, who had started every game this season.
Luxbacher saidKarastruggled against set pieces
versus Seton Hall last Saturday, and he thought
Aberegg’s 6-foot—4~inch frame would translate
to a more dominant presence on a restart play
from the Vikings. '

Cleveland State beneﬁted from an accidental
goal 35 minutes in to make the score 2-0.

Viking]effBaker’s attempted pass to team-
mate Audric Kilroy ricocheted off a Pit defend-
er’s foot and past Aberegg. .

Cleveland State goalkeeper Brad Stuver pre-

_ served the Vikings’ shutout and made three

saves that night. Wednesday’s scoreless effortis

the ﬁfth out of the last six games for Pitt.
“There’s only so much you can do,” _Lux—

bacher said. “You have the same players, trying

to put different guys in different spots. It’s not
a lot of small things systematically more than
guys trying to do a job and having to make the
play when it’s there.”

In addition to a struggling offense, the Pan-
thers also have to cope with two injuries suffered
against Cleveland State.

~ Luxbacher said freshman forward Robert '

Iledare “probably broke his ankle” in the ﬁrst
minute, and starting defender Alex Harrison
also left the game with an injury.

Luxbacher doesn’t know how much time
he will miss.

“Hopefully, he’ll play over the weekend,” he

said. “I don’t know. He couldn’t play tonight.” ,

Cleveland State improved to 5-6 on the sea-
son and is 15-1-3 in its last 19 home games with
the victory.

Meanwhile, Pitt returns home to play Mar- '

quette at Founders Field Saturday at 1 p.m. The
Golden Eagles (4-3-3, 1-o—1 Big East) tied nation-
ally ranked No. 3 Connecticut last Friday, and
Luxbacher said they are going to be a handful.

“But we know what we have to do,” he said.
“We have to get it going. We’re deﬁnitely in a
struggling period.” I
