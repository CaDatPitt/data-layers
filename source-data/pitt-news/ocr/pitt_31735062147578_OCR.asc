Noblemau From New York
Will Take Your Owl Photol

 

By Jean Barnes
Does mystery get you?
Do you dote on military mustaches?
Or does a Russian-French-English
accent give you chills and thrills?

Then make the appointment to have
your picture taken for the Owl right
away quick. Because you can meet
all of these things in the ﬂesh. I

Mr. Babit, who has just come on
from his own New York studio to
make the Owl pictures, has all of
these and more. He has a back-
ground of Russian noble blood, a
mother who was a raving beauty, and
a cigarette case over 75 years old.

And he won’t ta1k—about his an-
cestry, or much of anything.

He did say that he was a painter,
producing mostly marines, and that
he has studied in Petrograd—now
Leningrad—in Vienna, and Paris, and
has exhibited in all these places and
in Rome besides.

He wears a little purple ribbon in
his coat-lapel, which matches the rib-
bon 011 the award he carries in his
wallet. This award is the highest one
an "artist can attain, being the honor
of receiving an oﬂicership in the
French Academy.

In Vienna he studied in the Imperial
Art School. In Rome he exhibited in
the International Exhibition, of which
the-King of Italy was the President,
and there he received another award.

Besides all these he packs in his
suitcase with his toothbrush the
Grand Prix, which is an honor this
year or any other year.

International Exhibit Needs Greater,
Broader Representation, Hovey Says

There is need for a new and wider
representation at the Carnegie Art
International Exhibition, lest the show
begin to stagnate, according to VVal-
ter R. Hovey, professor and acting
head of the ﬁne arts department.

“It is annoying,” said Mr. Hovey,
“to see the same names and the same
schools of painting over and over
again, when many different artists
and schools might be represented.”

Mr. Hovey then proceeded to enum-
erate the schools of Lurcat and Mas-
son and the artists Paul Klee, Ernst,
and Chirico as desirable in any rep-
resentative showing of international
art. Japanese painting, he felt,
should likewise be included, especial-
ly since it is now in the accustomed
European tradition.

The ﬁne arts head pointed out that
the South American work seems even
more derivative from Europe than
does the American. France, he de-
clared, still leads the ﬁeld in paint-
mg.

Some of his favorites are: Braque’s
“Napkin Ring,” Segonzac’s “very
lovely ‘Spring Landscape,’ ” Karl Hof-
er’s “Landing,” the American John
Carroll's “Sleeping,” and Alexander

Brooks’ portrait of his wife.
“Matisse’s work this season,” he
said, “is abominable. It is not at all
his best. Salvadore Dali seems to be
at the crest of a wave which is pass-
ing by. He has the trick of putting
a false depth of imagery in his colors.
which remind one of Maxﬁeld Parrish.-

Picasso’s “Ma Jolie” indicates that;
the cubist movement has not yet
died out.”

When pressed for his reactions to
the prize winners, Mr. Hovey de-
clared, “There has been too much em-
phasis on the prize winners in the.
past. The show must stand on its’
merits as a whole. In fact, it appears’-
that the public now comes primarily;
to see the exhibition as a whole,-
rather than any speciﬁc paintings.” ,

However, he did admit that he-
thought there were many other paint-
ings as excellent as the ﬁrst prize-
winner, “Elvira and Tiberio,” whose
chief, merit “lies in its technically,
clever and naive rendering.” The
third prize winner, “Deep Water,” he.
thought most worthy of its award.

Mr. Hovey concluded with the warp-
ing that it is impossible to judge the
paintings at the ﬁrst trip.

Council To Plan
Seminar_At Tech

Grace Elliot To Address Group
At Meeting November 4

Tomorrow the YMCA Council will
meet in Room 1 of the Y Hut for a

lunch and general business meeting.
The Council will arrange for the com-
ing Intercollegiate Seminar November
4 which will feature as speaker, Grace
Loucks Elliot of New York City.

Mrs. Elliot is .known on many campi
of the Middle Atlantic states as an
author and a lecturer. She will ad-
dress students from the University,
Carnegie Tech and PCW. ‘

It has been decided by the commit-
tees of the three schools that the
seminar will meet on the Carnegie
Tech campus for an afternoon and
evening of discussio_n._ There will also
be a dinner at the Carnegie Inn. Fur-
ther information can be obtained at
either Heinz House or the Y Hut.

In regard to the YM-YVVCA Asso-

chairmen, Sarah Marie Wood, C37,
Ann Thompson, C38, and Charles
Skuce, C38, announce that there will
be genuine old-fashioned square danc-
ing.

“Even if you can’t square dance,
don’t fail to come,” the committee
warns. “When you leave you will be
able to cut a caper with the best of
the old timers.”

In addition to the square dance,
there will be an illustrated talk on the
subject, “The Search for Beauty,” by
the American artist, Dr. Wallace Nut-
ting. ’

From 4 to 6 o’clock there will be a
meeting at the Y Hut for all mem-
bers of YMCA activities.

The dinner will begin at Heinz
House at 6:30 o’clock. The affair will
be open to all YW-YMCA members,
besides any interested member of the
faculty or student body. Those who
wish -to attend and have not already
registered should do so today at either
the Y Hut or Heinz House. The cost
will be 35 cents.

Continues Study

Louis Laufe, of Charleroi, gradu-
ated last year from the College, has
entered the Pennsylvania State Col-
lege of Optometry at Philadelphia.

Yet, after traveling in France, Eng-
land, It:-1ly_ Austria, and Germany, and
being a Russian originally, Mr. Babit
still believes that America is the best
country in the world at present.

“I hope that it will remain that way,
and I believe that it will. providing it
is not drawn into the war.

“You Americans have little to fear
from Communism. Those scare peo-
ple who think you will are wrong.
We in Russia are suffering now, but
America is too big. the nationalities
are too m.any, the education is too
good to allow Communism a foothold.

“Russia is in a bad condition now.
The people are little more than slaves.
They are not allowed to use soap.
They are rationed a. few pounds of
meat a month. They must work.
work. all the time, yet when they earn
a little money, a commissar comes
around and says, “So much for you,
the rest for me.”

Mr. Babit has traveled all over the
United States since he came to Amer-
ica in 1913, and of it all he likes ex-
cept for New York—the Northwest,
Orer:on_ Vvashington, and parts of
California.

“New York,” he said, “is cold. The
people are unfriendly, but I like it.”

In his studio there he photographed
such people as Mr. Quezon, president
of the Philippine Islands. the Payne
Vvhitneys, the Vanderbilts, General
Pershing, the Belgian King and Queen,
and the Earl Carroll Vanities’ chorus.
He went down to Washington, D. C.

Schultz Stresses .
Low Hop Tariﬂ"

The Sophomore Hop, designated 
the ‘,‘Homecoming Dance,” since it
precedes the “Homecoming” Army

game by one day, will feature the low-
est price in Soph Hop history.

According to D. C. Schultz, chair-
man, only one other Sophomore dance
has had a price as low as the $2.50
tariff set for this year’s affair. In ad-
dition, Schultz has arranged for free
checking with a “no—tip” policy. Free

arking, too, with unlimited space, is
another feature of the attempt to keep
the price low.

Archie Bleyer and his orchestra,
who recently concluded an engage-
ment at the Hollywood Restaurant in,
New York City, and who broadcasts“?
over the CBS and NBC networks, will,
provide the music. ' ‘ 

The dance will be held at the Twen-
tieth Century Club.

Two committee changes have been
announced. Melvin Rogow, C, re-
places Frederic Kelly, C, as publicity
chairman and Herbert Rackoff suc-
ceeds Lester Hamburg, C, on the gen-
eral committee.

Listen To Light,
Look For Music
At Electric Show

Scientiﬁc Sleight Of I-land Tricks
To Feature “House Of Magic”
Demonstration Tomorrow

Visible music and audible light are
two of the phenomena which will be
demonstrated in a General Electric
display to be held in Memorial Hall at
11:30 o’clock Thursday.

Billed as the “House of Magic,” the
demonstration is in charge of Herbert
Du Val, Jr., of the General Electric re-
search laboratory at Schenectady, New
York. It ﬁrst won fame as one of the
most-visited exhibits of the 1933-34
Century of Progress exposition at Chi-
c,ago.

Using the photo-electric cell, com-
monly called the “electric eye,” Mr.
Du Val will pick up music from a pho-
nograph and cast it upon a screen in
the form of parti-colored light. The
current from the phonograph pick-up
is so arranged as to travel to a lamp
instead of a loud speaker, the sound
waves being transformed into light.
The ‘lamp, ﬂashing on and off hun-

’ dreds of thousands of times a second,

transmits an ever-changing light beam
equivalent to the notes from the pho-
nograph record.

When the beam is focused on a pho-

‘ to-electric cell, the light is once more
— turned into music. _
' interrupted at any time by the inter-

The sound can be

ception of the beam. «By using a disk
to intercept partially the ray of light,
Mr, Du Val produces what he terms
“saxophone music with a scalloped
edge.”

Other experiments to be performed
include demonstrations of strange ra-
diations from gas-ﬁlled tubes; lighting
a lamp with a match; the sodium va-
por lamp; the stroboscope, designed
to make revolving objects appear sta-
tionary; and the effects of ultra-violet
rays.

These demonstrations. and others to
be included in the display, serve to il-
lustrate in a popular and spectacular
manner the advances being made in
industrial and" domestic life by elec-
trical rescearch. _

Concerning the “House of Magic,”
E. A. Holbrook, dean of the School
0. Engineering and Mines, state: “Its
demonstration has been so simpliﬁed
that it should be extremely valuable,
both as education and as entertain-
ment, to every student and faculty
member in the University.”

The special showing for engineering
and mining students is at 11: 3-0- o’clock
Thursday morning, and the general
showing for the entire University at
3 o’clock Thursday afternoon.

Local Job Level
Hits New 1935
Peak, BBR Shows

-Employment in the Pi‘tsburgh dis-
trict during September reached a new
high level for the year, according to a
statement released '-Friday by the Bu-
reau of Business Research.

The largest gains were reported in
the department stores and construc-
tion industry; the former noting an in-
crease of 20 per cent while the latter
increased the size of its payrolls by
17.4 per cent. Other gains for Septem-
ber were: -Glass products industry———5
per cent, Railroads—3.3 per cent, the
Iron and Steel group, exclusive of ma-
chinery, employed the same number of
people in September as in August
while the machinery group increased
0.7 per cent. Non-ferrous metals group
noted a decrease of 2.0 per cent in em-
ployment from August to September.

In a second statement issued the
same day, the Bureau reports no
change in the level of business in
Pittsburgh last week. The index of
general business activity in -which ad-
justment is made for seasonal changes
and for trend remained at 69.7 per
cent. The index of business last week
was about 24 points above the level
in the corresponding week in 1932 but
approximately 46 points below the
level of the same week in 1929.

College Assembly
Scheduled By CA
For Wednesday

Dr. Crawford Will Address Group
After His Formal Introduction
As New Dean Of School

All students in the College will be
dismissed from classes fourth hour
\Vednesday morning, but a committee
of the College Association is making
extensive plans, assuming that the
free hour won’t be considered merely
a vacation.

Beginning at 11:30 o’clock, a special
assembly will take place in Memorial
Hall. at which the Association will
present the newly appointed dean of
the College, Dr. Stanton C. Crawford.
Dr. Crawford took ofﬁce in the fall,
and has made no ofﬁcial appearance

so far before students in that school. ‘

Although no speciﬁc subject for an
address has been submitted by the
speaker, he has intimated that he
will “ramble” through a perhaps het-

rogeneous series of comments which‘

should integrate into a discussion of
problems, futures and outlooks of the
College students in America and par-
ticularly of the College students in
Pittsburgh.

Charles B. Holstein, ’36, is chair-
man of the Assembly program Wed-
nesday and will introduce the speaker.
On his committee are Gertrude Schein,
’36, and Edwin Beachler, '37, Cabinet
members. Paul Keiser, ’36, is presi-
dent of the Association.

Wednesday assembly can easily be
taken by students affected as only
respite from class, says Holstein. But
the Association, in sponsoring the pro-
gram, feels it has a project of deﬁnite
value. The ofﬁce of the School should
be a decided center of interest for
the various thousands registered there,
it is felt, and through this assembly
the dean will be brought from the
semi-seclusion of a mere “name” with
whom students have no contact to _be-
come a living person with good coun-
sel to offer.

Last year the College Association
sponsored a like assembly in introduc-
ing Dr. Herbert L. Spencer, who
served only one year as Dean of the
College before accepting the presi-
dency of Pennsylvania College for
VVomen. In this address, Dr. Spencer
“The College Student of
Tomorrow,” touching, among other
things, technological advances in in-
dustry, and the need for proper ap-
preciation of the use of leisure time,
which should eventually result through
shorter working weeks.

The Association, primarily prom-
inent on campus as the sponsor of a
number of inexpensive major dances
each year, also conducts a loan fund
for needy students in the College, and
on occasion presents assemblies desig-
nated to assist in the appreciation of
major social and educatonal problems.

Classes containing mixed enroll-
ment of College and School of Educa-
tion students will take place as usual
Wednesday fourth hour, although Col-
lege students will be excused from at-
tending.

Former Student Writes
For Experimental Theater

A former University pre-medical
student. Joseph Letteriello, has writ-
ten a poetic fantasy in blank verse

Now recognized under the pen name
of Jovis Maximilian, Letteriello was
active at the University in Cap and

Attorney-Instructor Recalls
Humorous Incidents In Court

A college instructor in the morning,
a lawyer in the afternoon—that’s the
daily schedule of William H. Markus,
instructor in business law at the Uni-
versity.

Attorney Markus, for he is a full-
ﬁedged attorney, is kept busy prac-
ticing law when he is not teaching.
He has tried many cases, both in
local and federal courts, and the ex-
perience he has gained in his work
he has transmitted to his classes in
business law.

Humorous is the story of a lady.
whom he had to subpeona for witness
duty. The housewife refused at ﬁrst.
giving as her excuse that she liarl
put up 300 glasses of jelly the night
before, but ﬁnally was prevailed upon
to come to court. Once there, she in-
sisted that she be paid off in the court-
room for her services, asking for a
day’s pay and taxi fare. which she
said was $1.25. She, incidentally, had
been on the stand for only 22 min-
utes. When the judge asked her
whether she wished $1.25 altogether,
she replied in an offended tone, “Say,
you must think I’m an awful cheap-
skate. I want five dollars for my
day’s pay, and $1.25 for taxi fare.”

Another incident that Mr. Markus
tells is about, in his own words. “the
dumbest man I have ever seen in
court.” This particular witness was
questioned as to whether he had been
an incorporator of a corporation
formed some 20 years before. He
could11’t recall whetlier he was or
not, so he was shown the original

papers and asked if that was his sig-
nature on them. His answer was, “I
don’t know.” When asked what he
meant, he replied “I’l1 have to go
home to get my checks and compare
the signatures.”

The attorney has had a lot of fun
trying cases in which insane persons
were involved. He recalls one boy
who was being tried to determine
whether he was sane or not. The
youth answered all questions in a per-
fectly sane manner, until the judge
was almost ready to declare him nor-
mal. Finally some one mentioned an
incident which had ’ro,do with officers
in McKeesport chasing him. and the
boy had an instant spell of insanity.
It turned out to be that that was the
only point on which he was insane.

In a similar case, an insane asylum
in Ohio applied for a guardian for an
apparent lunatic. Meanwhile, the in-
mate wrote letters to the judge, in-
sisting that his relatives were trying
to frame him. The judge was so in-
ﬂuenced by these letters that he or-
dered a hearing to prove the man's
insanity. When ofﬁcials arrived at
the institution to bring the man from
Ohio he became crazed, and almost
ruined the hospital. He made the
journey in a straiglitjacket. In the
courtroom he appeared perfectly
sane. Then the judge came in. The
subject said, “Good Morning, Judge,
Good Evening, Judge.” Then he added
soberly. "Well, good iiiglit, Judge, I
guess that I’ll have to be going.” It
didn’t take the judge long to dismiss
the case.

Student Alliance

N THE NEWS columns of Friday’s paper was
recorded the ﬁrst activity of a new group on
campus, to be known as the Student Alliance.

The organization is preparing to present its ap-
plication to the Student Faculty Association for a
club charter and, of course, does not exist until
that application is accepted.

In its constitution, drawn up for the presenta-
tion to SFA, the body’s purpose is “to promote
the general welfare and social understanding of
students and faculty of the University of Pitts-
burgh.” Its policies concern “support of academic
freedom and opposition to educational intrench-
ment, crystallizing the sentiment of University
students for peace, opposing discrimination against
minority groups on campus, supporting clean cam-
pus policies, aiding in campus service projects, and
clarifying the student ’s relationship with the out-
side world.”

Interest seems to indicate that there is a place
for such an organization on campus. With the
proper University faculty supervision, and with an
attitude of sincerity among the members of the Al-
liance, there is every reason to believe that its ap-
plication for a charter will be received favorably.

Once granted the right to go ahead, the organi-
zation may proceed on to some very healthy and
stimulating work. It must also be clear to the
members that their activities must fall within some
bounds if they are to achieve any degree of
success.

Athletics And Politics

N EVERY HAND we have been hearing a.nd
% reading items pertaining to a proposed boy-
cottyof the Olympic games by the United
States. Advocates of the boycott have held the
floor almost without interruption until a few days
ago when the gentlemen high up in the ranks of
United States Olympic team sponsors laid down a
barrage which sent the boycottists back to the
trenches and out of the newspaper headlines.

It appears that the Olympic committees have
held their ﬁre until the whites of the opponents’
eyes came into view. Back in 1776, it has been re-
corded, that plan of battle brought rather satisfac-
tory results. VVhetlier the pro-participants will
continue to hold the center of the stage from now
on is a matter of conjecture. It must be admitted,
however, that they have some mighty strong
points. ’

To come out openly and advocate that the
United States send its star athletes to Berlin seein-
ingly is voicing an approval of the worst phase of
Hilterism. Only by discounting such a relation-
ship between athletics and politics can we proceed
with a judgment of the case.

Those who favor the boycott deem it a right
proper method of showing Herr Hitler and his as-
sociates that the United States does not approve of
the way he is handling things in Germany. The
German press, they claim, is so politically edited
that the people may read only what Hitler believes
they should read. A boycott action by this coun-
try would‘ bring home to the people across the
water the idea that all is not well in Germany.
Just why the conductors of the German press
would not temper the news of the United States’
athlete boycott is a point which the anti—partici-
pants fail to mention.

The idea of bringing athletics into politics is at
once unwholesome and improper. University stu-
sents will likelyrrecall the columns of fuss which
were printed last spring when the Panther basket-
ball team scheduled a game with Louisiana State.
The hue and cry raised by some sections about
Pitt ’s meeting on the basketball floor a team from
a school under the inﬂuence of Huey Long didn’t
do either of the schools much good. The game
went off without incident and the Panthers are
planning a trip to Louisiana this season.

Moreover, when the anti-participants make their
statements they do not appear to consider the hun-
dreds of athletes scattered throughout the country,
some of whom may be listed among University stu-
dents, who have tra.ined for years with eyes and
hearts set on participating in the Berlin games.
The layman may hasten to ask just what relation
there is between a few hundred disappointed ath-
letes and hundreds of thousands of fellow men
whose life in Germany is being made miserable.

It may then be suggested that there is no rela-
‘tion between the two viewpoints. This seems to
‘prove that athletics should not enter into our
iinethods of showing Germany that we are not in
accord with its policy. Once begun, a policy of
Olympic games boycotting might lead to the gro-
tesque picture of the host country’s diplomats
standing down at the dock and watching the ath-
letes disembark to ﬁnd out what foreign countries
approve of its policies.

The Olympic games are deﬁnitely of an interna-
tional scope and the manner in which they are
conducted is perhaps the best example of good
sportsmanship which exists in athletics. The prime
factor about the games is that they are being held;
where they are being held niakes little difference.
Everyone will agree that German authorities are
likely LO bend over backward in dealing with the
Jewish and Catholic competitors from other na-
tions next summer. ’\Vitli that point assured, it
seems unnecessary to drag the ﬁnest contest in
athletics tlirougli mire.

Certainly it would be interesting to learn just
what coinmeiits the godlike ﬁgures on old Mount
Olympus are making when they hear of this con-
troversv.

Makes Players’ Show

By Ray Maclntyre
When “The Show-Off” is presented
by Pitt Players on November 14, the
cast will be composed of some very
unusual personalities, if the esti-
mates which members made of them-
selves in the presence of a Pitt News

reporter are any indication.

John Parks. BA37, born in Pitts-
burgh, attended Union High School in
Uniontown, Pa., where he was presi-
dent of his graduating class, student
director of the orchestra and band,
and dramatic club president. He play-
ed football for three years on the
fourth team, and spent some time as
a saxophone player and specialty per-
former with a jazz orchestra which
made a tour of Eastern United States.

Parks always sees the bright side
of things, and likes to associate with
people. In his own words, he is a
“devout worshipper of ‘glitter.’ ” He
smokes ﬁendishly, can chew, but ﬁnds
it disagreeable. In the way of amuse-
ments, he likes—besides acting—danc-
ing, movies, golf, and building model
locomotives,

Beverly Childress, C38, was born in
Edgewood. She attended Edgewood
High School, where she excelled in
dramatics, taking the roles of “But-
tercup” in “Piiiafore,” of the gum-
chewing lady friend of a prizeﬁghter
in “Purple Towers,” of a gun-toting
Russian spy in “Melinka of Astrakan,”
and of “Rosetta” in “Page the Prince.”

Miss Childress does not worry much,
and likes to be around people. She
has prejudices——hates riding back and
forth between Oakland and Bellevue
on the street car, running from Alum-
ni Hall to Carnegie Lecture Hall for
psychology, and having to endure the
stench of John Parks’ long black
cigars. She likes dancing. Her chief
claim to fame, she says, lies in her
never having kept a. “date” waiting.

Carolyn Hall, known among friends
as “Kit,” was born in McKees Rocks,
and graduated from Miles Bryan High

School in that burg. She was Vale-
dictorian of her graduating class, edi-
tor ()f the ‘R01: Rocket,” winner of an
alto solo contest, active in athletics,
and participant in many operettas,
minstrels, and community plays. At
Pitt, Miss II-Iall played in Pitt Players’
“The Torch Bearers” and “Fashion.”

When asked if she had enjoyed suc.
cess as an actress, Miss Hall replied,
“Yes, I think so, and all my friends do.
I don't speak to the others.” She \is
known as a happy person, but says she
does not feel funny all the time. She
likes to dream, but enjoys comfort too
well to make her dreams come true.
Her hobbies are songwriting, dramat-
ics, singing, and working with chil-
dren. Dancing and athletics are also
important. Miss Hall hates bees,
snakes, bugs, people who don't keep
promises, and hypocrites.

Audrey Graham, ‘I338, was born in
Baltimore, Md., and has lived since in
Richmond, Philadelphia, and Mt. lLeb-
anon, where she attended high school.
She was a. member of National Honor
Society, and active on committees. She
has taken part in high school and
community plays, and at the age of
eleven took the lead in a drama and
dancing exhibition directed by Ma-
dame Calanova, Russian danseuse.

Miss Graham once won a trip to
Maine on the basis of an oration.
“Why I Joined the Girl Scouts.”

When asked about her character,
she replied, “Im a redhead. What
more do you want?” Her hobbies and
amusements are: horses, horseback
riding, dogs, and a whole block of
cream cheese for breakfast every day.
She is partial to vaudeville, circuses,
and ballets. She hates to get up in
the morning. and loves to go to bed
in the morning.

Richard Frankel, C39, was born in
VVi1kinsburg, Pa. He attended Taylor
Allderdice High School, where he
achieved “no scholastic honors.” He
was a member of the Taylor-Allder-
dice Players Guild, and directed the
staging of his high school class play.
His mother thinks he is a fairly decent
sort of a person, according to his own
statement.

Frankel enjoys most reading and
dancing. He has collected stamps,

coins. insects, tropical ﬁsh, and pipes.

Alumnus Comes F romlforea

For Graduate Dentistry Work

Is there opportunity for a dentist
in Korea?

An alumnus of 1918 thought -so. And
now Dr. John L. Boots, D18, director
of the Dental School of Severence
Union Medical College in Seoul,
Korea, and builder of the most mod-
ern dental clinic in the Orient, is back
in America on a furlough — to do
graduate work.

“When I was graduated, the heads
of the most powerful mission boards

‘told me that there was no room for a

dental clinic in Korea. It was a closed
country, with hatred of foreigners al-
most a. religion,” Dr. Boots said, ex-
plaining why he took up private prac-
tice for a time.

Three years later, inspired after
meeting the president of Severence
Union, Dr. Boots sold his house and
car and sailed for Korea. VVith the
enthusiasm of a missionary, he set up
a small, inadequate dental clinic, and
began to instruct the more intelligent
Koreans in the intricacies of den-
tistry.

“The clinic ﬁlled a long-felt need
among the natives and missionaries,”
he reminisced. “The poor inhabitants.
who had been accustomed to having
their teeth pulled without anaesthetic,
did not know how to express their
joy. Patients came from all over the

Radio Club Chartered
To Build, Use Station

The executive committee of SFA
last Wednesday approved the charter-
ing of the University Radio Club, an
organization whose purpose will be
to construct. and operate an amateur
transmitting station at the University.

Membership is limited to students

interested in amateur radio to the ex-
tent that they have obtained an ama-

teur radio license or plan to do so
within a two-year period. Any mem-
ber of the faculty may become a mem-
her.

At present there are 28 members in
the club, including eight licensed ama-
teurs. Herbert Bouqiiiii is president
pro-tem, while Elmer Barth is tem-
porary secretary. George A. Scott,
associate professor of physics, is fac-
ulty adviser.

T. A. Siedle Addresses
Education Fraternity

Guests and members of Tau chap-
ter of Kappa Phi Kappa, national un-
dergraduate professional educational
fraternity for men, heard an address
by Theodore A. Siedle, assistant to
the dean of the School of Education,

 

at a smoker in Trees Gymnasium
Thursray.
Mr. Siedle, faculty adviser to the

group, presented the following ten-
point plan of qualiﬁcations necessary
for teachers: ability, adaptability, am-
bition, humility, loyalty, sympathy.
manners, tact, neatiiess, and strength.
"A teacher must be,” he said, “a hu-
man being with a broad outlook and
a social consciousness.”

Officers of the group are: president,
Robert Mease, ’3G; vice president,
Robert Elder, ’36; secretary. Earl
F01-syth, ’36; and treasurer, Richard

country—even from neighboring sec-
tions of Japan, Formosa, China, and
Manchuria.” ,

From this modest beginning, Dr.
Boots conceived the idea for a large
and modern clinic to take care of all
who came, and also to serve as a
school for Oriental dental students.

‘Completed in 1932 after several
years of money-raising and building,
the four-story hospital is the most
complete and modern in the ﬁeld of
American foreign missions. It is fur-
nished according to the latest scien-
tiﬁc standards, and even has a chil-
dren’s room, with scenes on the walls
to keep the child amused. _

Dr. Boots built the clinic almost
single handedly: “I drew the plans
and explained them to workmen who
couldn't understand English. I super-
vised every detail of construction and
even plumbed the door and window
frames——my Chinese carpenters’ eyes
were not conscious of the line of
gravity. I would sometimes leave my
patient in the chair in the old build-
ing and go over and tear down a
whole section of wall where they had
not water-soaked the brick or forgot-
ten the iron reinforcement. And the
only thing I had ever built in my
life was a chicken coop.”

The hospital last year treated more
than 6,500 patients.

Winds, Weather
Retard Netters

Blistery autumn winds which
have retarded the match play in the
annual University tennis tournament
stopped long enough on Friday after-
noon to allow one match to be played.

Ralph Bald, seeded No. 2 star, de-
feated Ben VVood. 6-2, 6-4 to advance
to the quarter-ﬁnal bracket. Joe Mad-
den, varsity net captain and seeded
No. 3 player, and Hoffman, freshman
entry, advanced to the third round
through defaults.

Eugene Cohen, tournament mana-
ger, hopes to have the ﬁnals played
by Friday in spite of the setback by
the weather.

J. Madden and Hoffman, by virtue
of their victories, joined ten other
players who had previously gained
the third round. Cohen hopes to have
all quarter-ﬁnal matches played by
Vvednesday afternoon, with semi-ﬁnals
on Thursday, and the championship
round on Friday.

Eight of the eleven players were
members of either last year’s varsity
or freshman squads. Madden, Thomp-
son, Heckler, and Vlfilson are the re-
turning lettermeii, and Bald, Solow,
Locke, and McKeniia performed on
the 1935 freshman team.

Personal ities

Never Kissed, One Claims;
Another Hates Girls;
0 n e Satisﬁed

He claims that his most noteworthy
accomplishments was taking care of
two ﬁve-year olds at a summer camp.

John Weisbrod, C39, was born in
Pittsburgh. He says, “My ﬁrst words
were from Hamlet—‘To be or not to
be’—-but their clear tones and marvel-
ous elocution were stiﬂed by the Pitts-
burgh smog, so I became just another
baby.” Weisbrod graduated from
Shadyside Academy with second hon-
ors. He was active in school affairs.
He has had dramatic experience in
the Gargoyle Club of Shadyside Acad-
emy, and the Masquers, a local ama-
teur organization.

Weisbrod claims he is more intro-
vert, and has his own brand of moral-
itY, religion, honesty-—all of which are
acceptable still to society. Anything
amuses him. He hates girls with loud
voices and boyish bobs.

Robert Madden, C37 was born in
Rockford, Ill., and has lived all over
the county.” He attended Palo Alto
High School in the city of that name
in California and graduated from
Schenley. His honors achieved there
were emphatically “not scholastic.”
he confesses. He played an important
role in his high school class play.

“Kind of person?” he answered in
reply to questioning, “very, very good,
but it’s not my fault."

Chalmers ‘Brown, Ed37, born in
Pittsburgh, also graduated from Schen-
ley High School, where he was asso-
ciate editor of the Schenley Triangle,
and a member of the class play cast.
He wishes he had been born in some
place like Timbuctoo, because it
sounds more impressive. His chief di-
version is looking at girls.

Raymond Maclntyre, C38, was born
in Chicago, and graduated from Pea-
body High School in Pittsburgh. He
was an associate editor of the Pea-
body Civitan, and a member of the Na-
tional Honor Society. His only claim
to fame in drama lies in two church
plays, in the midst of one of which the
platform caved in.

Lion Team Bows
Before Panthers
‘After Stiff Fight

, Hold Pitt Eleven Scoreless Until

Patrick Kicks Field Goal
Late In Third Quarter

Johnny Economos Stars

The heart of the Penn State Lion
Saturday lived up to all the nice
things said about hearts of leaders of
the animal kingdom. For almost three
full quarters the State College team
fought off the charges of a more
powerful Panther team before suc-
cumbing, 9-0, at the Stadium.

To be true, it must be said that
errors by the Pitt gridmen were of
some beneﬁt to the visitors, but they
detract little from the game ﬁght
displayed by a somewhat underrated
State team.

Leon Shedlosky’s brilliant 48-yard
run early in the ﬁrst quarter seem-
ed to point the way to a Panther ﬁeld
day. Leon did a classy bit of side-
stepping and dodging to bring the ball
to the State 22-yard line. Pitt took
the ball up to the two, but State
smeared the next play for a loss and
the ﬁrst Panther bid for a score went
up in smoke.

The State punt out of danger was
short and after three plays barely
missed counting up to a ﬁrst down,
Patrick went back to the 19-yard line
and tried a placement kick that went
wide. Another Pitt advance stopped
in the middle of the second quarter
when Silvano, State fullback, inter-
cepted La Rue’s pass.

Pitt Recovers Fumble

Midway in the third quarter Knapp,
visiting back, contracted a case of
fumblitis which had been bothering
the Pitt backs in the ﬁrst half, and
the Panthers went to work on the
State 21. La Rue picked up eight
yards and a ﬁrst down, but Randour
and La Rue could gather only eight
more on the following three plays.
Patrick went back again to kick, this
time from the 14, and the sophomore
fullback made good.

That score took the tension away
from the Panthers as the ﬁnal quarter
began and when Michelosen inter-
cepted a State pass, carrying it to
the opponents’ 41-yard line, Pitt was
off again. A pass from Randour to
Adams put the ball on the 27, Shed-
losky added eight yards in two tries,
and Patrick went all the way to the
seven-yard line for a ﬁrst down.
Shedlosky gained two and Patrick
carried the ball so close to the goal
line that a good puff would have sent
it across.

On the next play the Panther full-
back went over with yards to spare.
He missed the try for point and the
scoring activities for the day ended
right there.

The Panthers as a team played
streaky foobtall, with Marlarkey,
Randour, Shedlosky, and Shaw doing
well individually. For State, the hon-
ors go almost undividedly to a stocky
guard, Johnny Economos, whose name
was on the announcer’s tongue after
virtually every Pitt play, Jo'hnny, a
‘Schenley High School product, was all
«over the ﬁeld making tackles. Cher-
undolo, at center, and Captain Weber,
State tackle who played the entire
game, also stood out in the losers’
great defensive play.

SAM Defeats

Sigma Alpha Mu’s touch football
nine advanced to the second round
in the Interfraternity football league
by scoring a 6-0 victory over Theta
Chi in a hard-fought game played at
Schenley Oval last Friday afternoon.

Shortly after the opening kickoff,
Siegal, SAM lineman, intercepted a
Theta Chi lateral pass near midﬁeld
and raced about 45 yards for the
only score of the afternoon.

Both teams played defensive ball
during the ﬁrst half, but in the sec-
ond part of the struggle, the Theta
Chi boys opened up with a passing at-
tack which netted them four ﬁrst
downs. The game ended with the pig-
skin resting on the SAM 20-yard
line.

Don Andrews, Theta Chi back,
stood out for the losers, contributing
several nice runbacks of punts. On
the line, Tom Bricker, Bill Gamble
and Charles Manterﬁeld played well,
keeping the winners from registering
any ﬁrst downs.

For the Sammy's, Ben Siegal stood
out by virtue of his long run, and
Freidlander, Irv Caplan and Ike
Wiener also played prominent parts
in the victory.

Today’s Interfraternity schedule
ﬁnds Kappa Sigma playing off Wed-
nesday’s postponed contest with Pi
Kappa Alpha. In tomorrow’s match
Phi Epsilon Pi meets Lambda Chi
Alpha in the other remaining ﬁrst
round game.

Another freshman team has been
added to the Med School league, boost-
ing the total to ﬁve. A call has been
issued for independent teams to sign

Chem Eleven Whips Miners

Sammy Team Advances To Second Round With 6-0 Win;
Engineers Score Twice To Beat Miners, 12-0

up with Intramural director, Mr.
Feely. There are already three teams
entered, and one or two additional
aggregations from College, Engineer-
ing school, or any other group with
no fraternity or Medical School af-
ﬁliations is needed.

After three unsuccessful attempts
to drill the Miners on the football
ﬁeld, Jimmy Nicholas’ Chem Engi-
neer eleven achieved success Thurs-
day on the Trees ﬁeld by a 12-0
count.

Late in the second quarter, »R’osz-
kowski, CE full, faded back to his
own 20-yard line and connected with
Ornelas on a pass over the goal line
for the ﬁrst score. Leonard’s buck
for the extra point fell short by a
yard.

Both teams blew scoring chances
in the next period of play before
Coleman tallied for the ﬁnal CE
marker on a strong-side reverse be
hind a three-man screen of interfer-
ence. This play opened up on the
Miners’ 16-yard line. The winners led
in ﬁrst downs, 8-3.

Last year, the Miners climbed to
the heavy side of the scale by the
same margin. Now, the Chem boys
take over the challenging role of the
Miners for the Intramural football
togs. Any teams that wish to dis-
pute their position should contact
Coach-Manager Nicholas at the Phi
Delt house, immediately.

Coleman stood out prominently at
fullback in the Miners’ attack. The
entire victorious backﬁeld, composed
of Leonard, Roszkowski. Gray and Di
Dominica, functioned smoothly for
Chem Engineers.

Panther Harriers
Beaten By State

Olexy, Lion Ace, Finishes First
As Visitors Win By A Point

It took a sophomore, Pete Olexy, to
catch a crippled and highly under-
rated Panther harrier team, 27-28, in
the Pitt-Penn State cross-country duel,
Saturday, over the ﬁve-mile Schenley
course.

Six men on Olson's squad stepped
out at the start on Flagstaff Hill to
hold an early lead over the Nittany
runners. Gradually the Lions, who
are now undefeated in nine straight
duel contests, pulled up as Olexy,
Trimble, and Book shared the lead
with Cook (if Pitt.

Red Tost,, Olson's ace, was back in
sixth place until the boys hit the mid-
way marker close to-the merry-go-
round. Here Tost stepped up to the
second position, with Leggin of Pitt.

Olexy ﬁnished in the fair time of
28:21 minutes.

Tost, in second, was followed close-
ly by Leggin, Trimble of State, and
Book, State. Completing the ﬁrst ten
were: Cook, Pitt, sixth; Downey,
State, seventh; Emens, Pitt, eighth;
Theriault, Pitt, ninth; and Clark,
State, tenth.

In the preliminary meet between
the freshman teams at 10 o'clock,
Woodruif led his mates to their fourth
consecutive victory as the State vic-
tory streak of three straight was
snapped, 20-35.

Henderson, State, ﬁnished second,
followed by Filson, Zamborski, and
Tredennick, all of Pitt. Bonorati com-
pleted the little Panthers’ score in
seventh position.

Little Panthers Lose
To Kiski Eleven, 12-6

Coach Mike Milligan’s Panther
yearling eleven lost its second
straight game dropping a close deci-
sion to Kiski by a score of 12-6 at
Saltsburg, Saturday.

The Little Panthers made their
lone touchdown in the ﬁrst few min-
utes of the game. On the ﬁrst play
after the opening kickoff, Marshall
Goldberg, star ball carrier from El-
kins, West Virginia, broke loose and
ran 85 yards for the score.

Kiski came right back and pushed
over the tying six-pointer in the sec-
ond quarter when Radman, halfback,
went over the goal line on a end run.

With matters at a standstill in the
fourth quarter, a Pitt fumble gave
Kiski the break it needed. Skemp,
Kiski fullback, did most of the ball
carrying as the prep school boys
marched 58 yards for the winning
score, with Skemp getting credit for
the touchdown.

Did You Know?

Wettach Awards Recognize
Three Highest QP’s
In Pitt Athletics-

It is probably safe to say that more
than 99 per cent of the student body
has never heard of the C. D. Wettach
Awards. Anyone who buys a pro-
gram at a football game knows that
Mr. C. D. Wettach is president of the
University Athletic Council. but few
there are who have heard of the
awards he sponsors.

The reason for this is that the pre-
sentations are made during the sum-
mer months. Each year Mr. Vvettach
investigates the scholast.ic standings
of students participating in all
branches of University athletics. The
awards then go to the freshman and
varsity athletes with the highest
quality point rating.

Last summer the awards, handsome
wrist watches, went to Miller Munjas,
Charley Gongloff, and Freshman Tom
Locke.

Munjas was an All-American quar-
terback for the Panthers last year
and virtually an All-A student. Gong-
loff has seen service on Panther foot-
ball, boxing, and track teams. He
climaxed his track accomplishments
by breaking the collegiate record for
the javelin throw at the National Col-
legiate meet in California last June.

Lock swam on the freshman team
last year and is out for a varsity
berth this season. He is also a sports
reporter for The Pitt News, and he
never thought that his winning one
of the awards was worth a story.

Coach Corr Plans To Hold

Novice Swimming Contests

With touch football leagues going
at a great rate, basketballs beginning
to swish through the hoops down at
the Stadium, and a tennis tournament
nearing its ﬁnal stages at the Trees
Gymnasium courts, Coach Pat Corr,
varsity swimming coach, plans to riv-
al these activities by holding a series
of swimming meets each Wednesday
evening at the Trees Gymnasium
pooL

The main purpose of these meets
will be to foster an enthusiasm for
swimming among the younger boys of
Pittsburgh.

Carlson Pages All ‘Chipper
Charley’s’ At Stadium Today

“It ’s All In Fun,” Asserts Basketball Coach As He Opens
Games For Freshmen, Upperclass Novices

Just exactly what happens when a
novice basketball player meets an-
other novice basketball player with a
novice official in charge will be dem-
onstrated this afternoon at 2 o'clock
when Dr. Carlson's annual cage car-
nival, under the heading of Freshman
Basketball Week, gets under way at
the Stadium.

For at that time two strictly novice
cage teams will face each other in the
opening of a week’s tournament held
by Dr. -Carlson for the University's
freshmen and upperclassmen. The
tournament, beginning this afternoon,
will run tomorrow afternoon, Thurs-
day, and Friday, from 2 o'clock to 6
o’clock each day,

Today's application blank is the last
opportunity for all students interested
to be eligible for the tournament and
a place for one of 1..ie teams that will
be chosen by Dr. Carlson. The quin-
tets this year, instead of being enter-
ed as teams as they were last year,
will be of the pick-up variety. When
ﬁlling out the application blank it is

important that the novice state the
time which will suit him the best.

One of the features of the week will
be the awarding of prizes by Dr. Carl-
son. The oddest uniform, the biggest
feet, the hairiest legs, the loveliest
ﬁgure, even perhaps the thickest
heads, are a few of the contests that
will be judged upon by officials. No
hint as to the exact nature of the
prizes is available, but the novice can
be certain that they will be as
unique as the contests.

In the playing line, there will be
ﬁrst and second prizes for the team
that wins the most games and the
players who compile the most points
in games during the week.

In addition to the fun received from
playing basketball, Dr. Carlson hopes
that the novice players will receive a
much greater benefit out of the tourn-
ament through the new friendships
made. After all, as Dr. Carlson ad-
mits, the main idea of the entire week
is to have the freshmen and others be-

come better acquainted.

Visitor From Australia Decries
Intense Nationalistic Feeling

Instructor At Sydney,—Here To Address Frick School
Body, Shows Admira.-tion For Unorthodox Buildings

By Martha Fuller ' J

“I am happy to call myself an in-
ternationalist,” said Dr. Marie Benti-
voglio in an interview in the Schenley
Hotel Thursday. She had just com-
pleted a lecture before the geograph-
ers of Pittsburgh in the Frick Train-
ing School auditorium.

Dr. Bentivoglio, professor of educa-
tion at Teachers’ College, Sydney, Aus-
tralia, is_ justiﬁed in designating her-
self as an internationalist of Italian
descent. She was reared and educated
in Australia, where her father was an
engineer in New South Wales. She
ﬁnished her education and received
her doctor’s degree at Oxford, ma.jor-
ing in chemistry, geology and geogra-
phy. .

As a geographer, Dr. Bentivoglio
made ﬁeld surveys in England for
the British government until she was
called to Australia to accept a pro-
fessorship in geography at Sydney.
Last year she was asked by the Na-
tional Geographic Society to do lec-
ture work on Australia in the United
States. Last summer she taught dur-
ing the summer session at the Uni-
versity of Minnesota. She spent the
early fall in Europe, returning to this
country last week. Her leave of ab-
sence from Sydney expires this year.

Dr. Bentivoglio, noted for her scien-
tiﬁc expeditions in unexplored parts
of Australia, devoted the past week
to visiting teachers’ colleges in Pitts-
burgh and the vicinity in an effort to

broaden her background for further
educational work at Sydney.

"The visit was her ﬁrst in Pitts-
burgh. About the city, Dr. Bentivog-
lio said:

“Of course, one could not expect an
industrial city such as Pittsburgh to
be beautiful. I ﬁnd it very smoky.
Your civic center, however, is un-
usual. Never have I see11 the laws of
harmony in architecture so violated,
yet producing such a pleasing effect;
So many styles and periods of ar-
chitecture are represented in just a
few blocks, that it would be hard to
believe without seeing it that the
group as a whole is impressive.”

The geographer admired the Cathe-
dral. She said:

“It is a beautiful building and es-
pecially appropriate. Learning should
reach toward the heights; it is ﬁt-
ting that the Cathedral should do so.”

“A sense of internationalism is the
most valuable contribution which
travel can make,” said Dr. Bentivog-
lio, who added that “an intense na-

tionalism is a dangerous and unde-

sirable spirit.”

British in speech, Dr. Bentivoglio is
a11 interesting combination of Italian
and English. She is deﬁnitely not a
typical Australian. Her attitudes and
viewpoints are English with an Ital-
ian picturesqueness.

For several days she was the guest
of Miss Zoe Thralls, assistant pro-
fessor of geography at the University.

F reshmanjiloeds Get Book
Telling ‘What To Do When’

Social Committee Of WSGA Compiles Booklet Dedicated
To “Great Tradition Of Beautiful Manners”

Freshman Janie, do you know how
to act when Upperclass Ursula asks
you out to lunch?

A11d are you sure which dress to
wear to the Mixer dance at Heinz
House, and which to wear to the Soph
Hop?

If you’re not sure, you’ll have

plenty of use for that little blue book
you got at mentor meeting last Fri-
day. ’
Its name alone is clever-Pittiquette
and the 24 mimeographed pages,
which tell you “the nice way of do-
ing it,” hold gemlike little bits of in-
formation worth gold to any Pitt
woman.

It has been compiled and issued by
the social committee of the WSGA.
under the chairmanship of Lula Se-
key, Ed37, after the custom of years
before, a.nd although the upperclass
women secretly sneak a copy out and
study it, its intention is to help fresh-
men over the rough places.

The booklet has been dedicated to
“the great tradition of beautiful man-
ners” and tells you how to introduce
people, in ca.se you had ‘forgotten,
how to dress for University occasions,
and even how to act in the library
and in class.

It informs you all about Heinz
House, Mrs. Foster—-——whom you should
know, how the nicest Pitt students

act in restaurants and on the street

car, and how to eat so that people
won’t think you’re just in from the
South Seas or the Antarctic.

It also mentions something that
more than freshman women are puz-
zling over~—-house-parties, and how to
go to them fashionably and comforta-
bly. Do you know that you have a. per.
fect right to ﬁnd out what social
events are going to take place so you
won’t have to take riding clothes and
a bathing suit on a guess, or be hung
up without a pair of walking shoes
when they all start out on a hike? And
are you the type of person who for-
gets to send bread-and-butter notes
when you get home?

Probably the most avidly read sec-
tion will be the one about the “Cor-
rect Form with Men,” which tells you
how to act when you enter public
places with a man, how to sit down at
a restaurant table when “The One”
asks you out to dinner; and it rakes
over the coals those girls who break
dates with one man to accept an invi-
tation with.another.

You can even ﬁnd out in this booklet
what to say and do when a man asks
you for a dance, and it admonishes
you to speak to people you see in your
classes, whether 0': not you know
them.

There is only one moot question
“Pittiquette” doesn’t answer; it is do
the men get one?

Panlzel To Don‘

Formals Again
For Freshmen

Freshman women have been dined,
danced and entertained by various
women’s organizations, and now the

ning, November 6.

Invitations have been extended to
freshman women for-the affair. Rep-
resentatives to the Council, senior
mentors, and ten women from each

lagher, violinist; and Frank Crispen,

which was scheduled for November
14, has been cancelled and will take
