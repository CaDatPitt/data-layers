It's going to Disney World .

Two weeks before their term in olﬁce essentially ends, current SGB
President Justin DalMolin, along with three board members, will spend
almost $3,000 in student activity funds to attend a four-day student services
conference in Orlando, Fla, on Nov. 22.

The group will spend $400 on food, $1,265 on hotels, and $1,102 on

A Pitt football player awaits trial
for allegedly threatening to shoot a
California University of Pennsylvania
football player and resisting arrest.

According to Rich Pomacher,
California's police chief, Pitt freshman
defensive back and running back
Victor Strader threatened to shoot
Calvin Brown and harassed three

other defensive players from ~Cal‘s
team.

Pomacher says Strader threatened
to shoot the four players because of an
argument that broke out between
Strader and the players after Strader
was heckling the team during their
Nov. 1 game against Shippensburg
University.

Strader and a friend, Sean Earl‘

- Wendy Wilkins from Arizona State

According to the search committee
chair, Edward Stricker, who also chairs the
neuroscience department, the search went
smoothly. '

"We're very pleased with the six candi-

dates we chose. The process by which they
were selected went very smoothly. We're on
schedule and we're very happy with the
candidate's we're bringing in," Stricker said.

In the lastmonth, the search committee
interviewed 13 candidates —— selected from
a total of 97 applicants —- for three hours
each.

. The interviews focused on topics such
as: .
. ° the candidates‘ visions of where edu-
cation in the United States is going in the
"coming years

0 the signiﬁcance of graduate education
and the importance of teaching at a research
university

0 the permanence of tenure decisions

- ideas about revisions in a core cur-
riculum ,

- gender equity and diversity

- and issues of f1md—raising.

The selection -of the candidates was
done by popular vote. Many of the deci-
sions were unanimous, and the rest were
nearly unanimous votes, according to
Slricker.

Representatives on the committee
include eight faculty members, a member
of theStaff Association Council, and two
students: Chris Briem of the FAS Graduate
Student Organization, and SGB President
Justin DalMolin.

Though DalMolin has made better stu-
dent representation in the University a plat-
form of his presidential term, he was not
present for the voting.

According to Stricker, DalMolin hasn't
participated since April.

DalMolin said he has not had much
time to dedicate to the process and that SGB
member David Teeters will take his place
on the committee.

"Now this is crunch time, and we want
to get someone in there," DalMolin said. "A
lot of what has gone on so far is just logis-
tics, narrowing the group down and so
forth. The real decision making comes
now." -

Chris Briem, who represented graduate
students on the committee, was present for
all the meetings.

"Briem didn't miss anything," Stxicker
said. "He is a very responsible member of
the committee, and a very valuable member
of the committee."

Of the 10 committee members, not
including DalMolin, Stricker said at least
nine were present for almost every inter-
view.

"We wouldn't schedule a meeting if

more than two people couldn't be there," he 1

said.

Candidates were also questioned in the V

interview about their knowledge of the state
of affairs at Pitt. ' V

In preparation for the interview, all can-
didates reviewed The University of
Pittsburgh Review — a 1995 document
better known as the Fisher Report which
discusses an external examiner's views
about how the University should restructure
itself.

They also reviewed the Phase IV doc-
ument — a plan to eliminate almost 40
tenured positions and replace them with 25
full-tirne, non-tenure—stream faculty mem-
bers.

The two documents detail many of the A

recent and proposed changes for FAS in the
near future.

"It was an interview in which we had
assumed they had done their homework,
and they had," he said.

All in all, Stricker said he is very happy
with the decision-making process the com-
mittee went through. _

"There was near unanimity without
disruptive objection," he said. "The process
felt good. The committee was not deeply
divided about any of these people."

DalMolin, who has struggled unsuc-
cessfully to get students on Pitt Board of
Tiustee committees, will explain how to get
shared governance between students and
administrators.

Bowman will lead a seminar on
"changing your student government image."

This trip, approved on Aug. 7, is one of
the items that was questioned by the entire
Allocations Committee ——- all 10 members
— who resigned in September to protest
what they called a misuse of power on the
part of DalMolin and then Allocations Chair
Gerald Klayrnan.

The committee accused DalMolin of
spending thousands of dollars from the stu-
dent activities fund over the summer on
extravagant trips that included luxury-car
rentals, four-star hotels and expensive meals.
The committee provided allocations
requests for the items as evidence of this.

Two weeks ago, Klayman resigned his
position and dropped out of the SGB presi-
dential race after University oﬂicials began
investigating accusations that he embezzled
thousands of dollars from the activities fund
for his own beneﬁt. '

Pitt Police and internal auditors are cur-
rently investigating this situation. The audi-
tors are investigating all student government
transactions since May, according to cm-
cials in the Oﬂice of Student Activities.

Because the decision to attend the con-
ference and speak about the allocations
process was made in early August, before
the accusations and allegations surfaced,
DalMolin said the SGB is sticking to the
original plan to attend. '

“It was the plan when we first decided
to go to the conference, and we see no rea-
son to deviate from that,” he said. “Yes, we
are looking to change some things and we
are thinking about talking about that at the
conference.”

Miller said they will discuss the alloca-
tions process because it "is fairly unique to
most of the schools in the U.S.”

“It is a hot topic because students want
that type of process in their schools,” she
noted.

Miller said the trip was in jeopardy after
the University began investigating

I Klayrnan.

“We weren’t sure if we were leaving the
oﬁice, -much less going to Orlando,” Miller
said. “Since then we have regrouped. Things
have been looked at, ﬁxed and amended.
Both Brian and I have a better sense of
where we are going with the topic.”

Miller and Giangarlo will also discuss
Pitt-TV, an information television channel
scheduled to hit the campus domrs next
semester. .

DalMolin said he will concentrate on
the "various tactics that may be utilized by
student government associations to evaluate
and improve their structure of shared gov-
ernrnent."

Bowman will address the conference on
how student governments can change their
image from "self-serving and egotistical" to
student-centered. Bowman said he will tell
those who attend his seminar about how

SGB has started town hall meetings, recruit-
ment strategies, football pep rallies, and the
"Pitt-preud community" campaign. '

He blamed the media for the bad image
SGB received over the past few months.

ThisistheﬁrsttimePittSGB members
have been selected to speak at the national
conference.

"We are very progressive in terms of
what we do here, and while we may not be
perfect, we are way ahead of the game,"
Giangarlo said. "People at the conference are

‘looking forward to having students come

down to talk because it presents things from
their perspective." '

Carrie, a spokeswoman for the conven-
tion and who refused to provide her last
name, said the SGB members were asked to
discussboththegoodandthebadsides of
their student government, including the allo-
cations process.

"We're pretty neutral on this. I am sure
thatatsomepointintheprocess theywillbe
questioned and drilled by administrators and

other student representatives about the

process," she said.

While the conference ' runs from
Saturday to Tuesday, Nov. 22 to 25, SGB
members, as well as Giangarlo, will stay in
"The Magic Kingdom" until Friday.

DalMolin said the student representa-
tives attending the conference will pay for
their own lodging and food for the remain-
der of the days until their retum ﬂight.

SGB members will take advantage of
this time to sightsee in and around Orlando,
according to Miller.

"I haven't been to Disney World in like
10 years," Miller said. She also claimed she
got a cheaper ﬂight home by waiting until
Friday to return. .

According to the student government
constitution, SGB and all governance groups
can be funded to attend more than one con-
ference a year and send more than one dele-
gate.
With the conference taking place so late
in the present board's term in oﬂice, the del-
egates will be informing the new board
about the conference and the topics dis-
cussed.

"We will be leaving behind ideas for the
next board," Riemer said. "When the new
business manager comes in, they will ﬁnd a
folder I've prepared. Whether they read it or
not is up to them."

President-elect Alyson Wallach thought
the conference was important both to Pitt
and to student government.

"I think it is necessary that they are
attending instead of the new board because
they know what Pitt doesn't have and what
Pitt needs," she said. "They can soak up the
information."

Saying that the nearly $3,000 SGB was
allocated for the conference was a lot of
money, Wallach felt the information gath-
ered would make up for the cost.

"I will be talking with them irmnediate-
ly upon their return," she said. "It is impor-
tant that we have experienced leaders going.
As long as they present the fact that it is not
a perfect process and that there are loop-
holes, I think it can be very advantageous."

 
 

 trip to Magic
Kingdom preposterous

Hey, Student Government Board: You’ve just
spent a year throwing around students’ money care-
lessly. What are you going to do?

We’re going to Disney World!

Well, isn’t that nice? Are you just going in order
to celebrate and cap off your wildly successful
spending-spree summer?

No, not just that. We’re also going to speak to
students from other schools.

About what? How they can get away with misus-
ing money?

No. Well, not exactly. We’re going to talk at a
conference in Orlando about some of our great
achievements: Pitt-TV, creating a positive image of
student government, and our “exceptional alloca-
tions process.” That’s how’ the brochure is billing it.

You’re kidding, right?

No. ‘

Pitt-TV still doesn’t exist, right?

Well, no it doesn’t.

And you’ve had a shameful, disgraceful year,
right?

Um....

And our “fantastic” allocations process might
have allowed someone to embezzle more than
$5,000 of student money, right?

Yet you’re still going to this conference to boast
about it, using students’ money, two weeks before
you leave office? And you’re not taking along any
incoming SGB members who can bring knowledge
back to put into practice?

Well, if you want to look at it that way....

Should students really be paying for this?
Shouldn’t the conference be paying for the trip since
you’ll be hosting seminars, rather than you using
student funds to go on vacation?

Well  it ’s for the good of the students.

Good of the students? Your SGB term will be
over in a few short weeks. You won’t be in a posi-
tion to make use of anything you learn.

That’s irrelevant.

What?

It doesn ’t matter.

Okay. Sure. Well, we hope you enjoy the amuse-
ment rides while you’re there. The ride you’ve taken
us on 'ha‘s,only made us vomit.

  OPINIONS

What's next:

 

Ertman

Rarely does a columnist have
such a perfect opportunity to
advance one of his personal caus-
es in a column. So, when this
opportunity arose, I felt the urge
to capitalize on it. The recent out-
cry over the injustices perpetrated
against Fred Sinkevich has
opened the door for other groups,
one of which I happen to belong
to, to voice their complaints.

I am a member of the
Cannabis sect of the religion
Smoakalottashit. Our religion
requires us to do some things
which outsiders might view as
strange, but which we ﬁrmly and
fervently believe to be the only
true way to inner and everlasting
peace. So that our fellow students
might better understand our
group and practices, I should out-
line our fundamental beliefs and
requirements.

Our group believes that
smoking marijuana 24 hours a
day, seven days a week, is the
only way to achieve holiness,
righteousness, and goodness. It is
through marijuana (“pot” to the
laymen) that we achieve inner
peace, and become one with our
god. In the absence of pot, ciga-
rettes may be used, but many
more cigarettes will be required
to achieve the same eﬁect that
pot has.

Our religion also requires us
to sacriﬁce a small farm animal
(a sheep, for instance) using a
lawnmower every hour, on the
hour, and then bathe in its blood.
Furthermore, we may only eat
meat which has been puriﬁed
using a combination of squid ink

and radioactive byproducts. Also,
every seven days, we must adorn
all nearby buildings (deﬁned as
anywhere within three blocks)
with the entrails of the animals
we have sacriﬁced during the
preceding seven days.

Our beliefs have also been
stepped on by this University,
and, for that matter, the govem-
ment of the United States. In a
land which prides itself on free-
dom and equality, we are unable
to smoke marijuana at all, let
alone 24 hours a day, are frowned
upon and molested by some

.members of society for sacriﬁc-
ing farm animals, promptly
arrested for attempting to adorn
buildings with their entrails, and
unable to ﬁnd a single store
which will sell properly puriﬁed
meat. We have also contacted the
AFL-CIO, the ACLU, and, just
for kicks, the NRA, without
effect. We have now decided to
take our case to you, the
American people and students of
this University. Will you allow
such blatant disregard for our
practices and those of Fred
Sinkevich to continue?

Of course you will. Because,
in case you haven’t ﬁgured this
out yet, there really is no
Cannabis sect of the religion
Smoakalottashit. But, if you
allow Fred to practice his beliefs,
there might be one in the future.
The laws of this country and,
more speciﬁcally, the rules of this
University, were supposedly cre-
ated for the common good. So
far, while, as Mr. Sinkevich
claims, they may be ineffective,
they have been proven to be fair
and just and generally helpful. As
such, we can and should not

THE PITT NEWS

allow one person’s beliefs to
infringe on the safety of the entire
student body. If we make an
exception for one, soon others
will come to the lawmakers, and
the exceptions will become more
and more outrageous, and the
proof will become less and less
veriﬁable, but the University will
just have to keep waving them
through, because the threat of a
law suit is too great to be ignored.

Furthermore, the rules for
University? residence halls are
stated in every piece of infom1a—
tion we received about them.
They ﬁrmly state that absolutely
no smoking is permitted in the
residence halls. If Fred is really
as fervent in his beliefs as he
claims, he should have elected to
live off campus, or, if that was
not an option, perhaps not even
come to this University. This
would have been smart, legal,
and in no way impinged upon his
religious freedoms. Instead, he
decided to live in the residence
halls, and raise hell. That sug-
gests many ulterior motives for
his ﬁght, but they will not be dis-
cussed here.

Normally, I side with the stu~ -

dent body, because we are cus-
tomers, and should demand the
highest-quality services, espe-
cially for the amount of money
most of us are paying to come
here. But this time, I really feel
that the University has our best
interests at heart in adhering to its
ﬂat “no smoking” policy. Sony,
Fred. Take it somewhere else.

Dan Ertman chose to accept
University rules regulations at
the very moment he decided to
come to Pitt. '

 

Coup d'etat for
Panther hockey

What led to. the downfall of Pitt ice
hockey coach Jim Brown? Not the blowout
losses to IUP or to Penn State, not the fact
that his team had surrendered a ﬂoundering
52 goals in six games, and not the 1-5 record
the Panthers posted before rrraking a team
decision that brought twenty-four players
together for the ﬁrst time this season.

Sunday night, after a draining three-day
road trip, the Panther hockey club sat down
for a 2 1/2 hour pow—wow that centered on
one subject: Jim Brown’s lack of dedication
to the University program. Brown, who
coaches two other programs, including a
junior Penguins team, missed Friday
evening’s game against the Navy
Midshipmen, then missed Sunday after-
noon’s game versus the Steel City Stars to
be at the games of one of the other teams he
was coaching.

What kind of message does that send to
your team — young men who may be
majoring in engineering or computer sci-
ence, who, instead of pursuing the college
vices of partying, girls and basically having
a good time, are devoting their free time to a
sport that isn’t even funded by the athletics
department?

A message that the head coach doesn’t
care?

Dan Lenza summed it up perfectly.

“When the guys interviewed him this
summer, he talked about his dedication to
the sport and his dedication to the team,”
explained the freshman forward. “This past
weekend, Friday and Sunday, he was coach-
ing other teams. That showed us a lack of.
dedication.”

Brown’s dedication was questioned at
the beginning of the season, when he asked
one of his players to organize offensive and
defensive lines minutes before the ﬁrst
game of the season. It became painfully
apparent this weekend and in response to
Brown’s actions, the Panthers reached a
majority decision Sunday night. The next
night, they asked their coach to resign from
his position.

Majority ruled. Brown stepped down,
somewhat ungraciously, and assistant coach
Wade Chouinard has been asked to take
over the team as they prepare to face off
against Duquesne University.

A former player in both the Paciﬁc
Coast Hockey League and the Western
Hockey League, priming grounds for the
NHL, Chouinard brings to the program a
ﬁerce love of the sport, an unmatched level
of dedication and a strong background of the

game.

Syracuse, suspensions on tap at practice

McMu||en, Stracler out indefinitely; Pitt prepares for stretch‘ run

Rachel Lenzi
Staff Wrlter

The Panthers football team
will be facing a potent
Syracuse team this Saturday
afternoon, but amid some off-
ﬁeld controversy.

Reports surfacing con-
cerning two team members,
tight end Kirk McMul1en and
defensive back and running
back Victor Stradler, have
swirled around the football
team as it prepares for its ﬁnal
drive toward a bowl game. But
Head Coach Walt Harris says
that the controversy isn’t hav-
ing much of an eﬁect on the
team.

“Most of our football play-
ers don’t read the papers, so
they really aren’t aware of
whatever is going on,” Harris
said "They do know that a
couple of their teammates are
no longer with the football
team right now.”

McMu]len was arrested
Halloween night after allegedly
assaulting two members of the
Phi Kappa Theta fraternity.
Stradler, after heckling four
California University‘ of

.-;°’*ii¢1i997r... . - .

Pennsylvania football players
at a Vulcans game, resisted
arrest last week when confront-
ed by authorities.

“We’re saddened by that, V

but we’re also trying to build a
program, and you have to build
a program with young men
who do the right thing all the
time,” Harris said, in response
to the incidents. “It’s ur1fortu-
nate, but we’re going to have to
make it without them.”
Focusing on the task at
hand rather than off-the-ﬁeld
incidents, the Panthers must
face the Orangemen in the ﬁrst
of three crucial back-to-back-
to-back Big East games.
“Syracuse has a lot to play
for. Obviously, they are a lot
more established than we are as
a football program but it’s up
to our guys to show that we’re
ready to play and ready to play
for 60 minutes,” Harris said, in
reference to the team’s last con-

_ test, a 1ate—garne loss to Boston

College.

Syracuse’s biggest gun is
quarterback Donovan
McNabb, who is one of the
most dominant players in the

Big East and in ﬂre nation.
Harris has been preparing his
team this week for the possibil-
ity of a strong showing from
McNabb.

“We’ve got our hands 
there,” said Harris of the
Syracuse signal-caller, “but one
of the best things to do is keep

McNabb off the ﬁeld. If our
offense does its job, we’ll stay
on the ﬁel .”

There are no starting—line—
up changes and no signiﬁcant
injuries to date. The only
change is that Saturday’s game
time has been moved up from
3:30 p.m. to 12 p.m.

' Although Pittsburgh was shut out for
the remainder of the meet, they were able to
take four other second place honors. But
despite their efforts they were not able to
put a dent inthe score, as Notre Dame dom-
inated the meet with a 201-99 victory.

For Notre Dame, senior Linda Gallor
came away with three ﬁrst-place ﬁnishes,
leading the pack in the 200-, 500- and
1000-meter freestyle contests.

Notre Dame swept the ﬁrst three
places in three events that night. They also
took three of the top four places in ﬁve addi-
tional events. The Irish also garnered the
top spot in the 400—meter ﬁeestyle and
meter medley relays. '

The Lady Panthers traveled to Virginia
to take on the Lady Cavaliers in a dual meet
on Sunday morning. Virginia came away
with a 168.5 to 128.5 win.

The Panthers were once again domi-
nated in the pool, coming away with only a
handful of wins.

f°We swam really well, but we did not

necessarily ﬁnish we ,” Cassidy-Keen
said.
Over the weekend the Lady Panthers 4

improved on many of their times from their

previous wins over St. Bonaventure and
Syracuse, but ﬂre Irish and the Cavaliers
simply outswam even their season—best
elforts;

The team only has one more dual meet
this semester, but they will pick up their
dual—meet schedule after the break

Coach Cassidy-Keen said that’ their
improvement this weekend should be’ “a
good edge going into January.”

On the wings of several season and
lifetime bests, Pitt stayed in the meet until
the last couple events.

“We were able to win races with some
phenomenal swims and most of the other
races were very close,” said Knoles. “We

Koller ﬁnished off his supersonic leg of the
200-meter medley relay by touching out
Virginia and winning by ﬂrree hundredths
of a second.

Two events later, senior Eric Stefanski
won the 200 free with a 1:41.07 in what
Knoles called a “great swim”.

Next, upstart freshman Devin Meece
touched the wall ﬁrst by more than a sec-

Koller then added to his earlier relay
win with triumphs in the 50 and 100
