affair.
Music Supplied

Music for the dance will be
supplied by the Walt Harper
Quintet. Tickets for the alfair
_may be purchased from all fra-
ternity men. Cost of the dance is
$2.25 per couple.

Remarking on the fact that
there will be no IF Queen
chosen this year, Petterson
stated, “We feel that there. are
queens elected for everything.
There is a Greek Week Queen, a.
Homcoming Queen, and many
others. We do not want to elect
a queen just for the sake of
electing ' one.”

In previous years, an IF Queen
was always elected. The girls
were nominated by the, different
fraternities and ﬁve ﬁnalists were
chosen: from the original contest-
.ants.~ The queen was chosen from
the ﬁve ﬁnalists and was crowned
. at the dance. Last year’s queen
-was Judy Franz.

Court Rules to Return

Tax   On Text-Books

Commonwealth Court decided Monday to waive .the
exemption of the textbook tax for college students. '

The State.Department of Revenue ruled earlierthis year
that university students would not be taxed on required texts
sold in a university-supported book store. The Rittenhouse
Book Store in.Philadelphia challenged this; it won its case

on Monday. 1
Paul Boltacz, general manager of the Book Center, com-

mented- that the amount of money involved was not that
large. “The money students saved
didn’t amount ‘to much. If they
spent $400 for books in four years,
the saving would be only $16.”
Must Have Cause

 

dents would have had for push-
ing for exemption except possi-
bly that young people have to
have a cause.”

Tom Ollofson, president of
Student Government disagreed
with Boltacz. He said the ex-
emption was not prompted by
young people who needed a
‘cause. “In fact, the assertion
that young people have this-
‘ need, is inaccurate and totally
unfounded.” .

“I ﬁnd it unfortunate that a
University student should. be
taxed on an intergeral part of
his education . . . which text-
books certainly are.” _

Why Illegal?

Judy Rockwell commented, I'm
going’ to look into the law and
ﬁnd ‘out why ‘the exemption
shguld be illegal._ We get few
enough considerations from the

“I don’t know what reason stu-

added.”

is going. The government says
that they want to ‘help higher

higher education, they are kind_

Students’ Schedules

Cause Cafeteria Lines

Food Service Feeds 800 in Twenty Minutes;

New Men’s Dorms to Alleviate Problem
By JOSIE GROSSMAN

Charles Douglas,

head of the Saga Food Service,

at-

tributes the bog in noon cafeteria lines toistudents’ schedules.
“75 percent of the student body has 12 noon to 1 p.m. off
for lunch. ,No wonder the pressure is so great from 11:55 a.m.

He reported that Saga tries to
prepare enough by 11:45 a.m. for

.800 students, the number usually

fed between noon and 12:20 p.m.
Problem Varies A

“The problem of supply varies
according to the dish being
served,” Douglass explained. “If
it should be served fresh from
the grill, we try to keep a rotat-
ing supply. If there is a sau-ce,
that ‘too should be fresh. Some-
thing that is roasted can be held
for a longer time. We have to
play each entree differently.”

Next year, Douglas feels, the
‘problem will be solved. The
new food service in the men’s
dormitories will have eight lines
for all the dorm students and
.will seat 1450.’ The present ca-
pacity is 602 served by three
lines.

“We can serve eight to ten a
minute in a single line,” Douglas
stated. “With 80 going through
every minute with the new facili-
ties, there won’t even be a line.”

Doing Everything

“We’re doing everything we can
to alleviate this year’s problem.”
Douglas concluded. ‘I recommend

that students who can eat before_

or after the rush hour come at

Douglas reported that Saga
checked with the Health Service
after hearing that over 50 stu-
dents got sick from turkey served
last week. ‘The Health Service
said that students ‘had been com-
ing in for days before‘ and after
with the same symptoms; it was

does I would say that perhaps the
time was too harsh to really ex-
perience. The undisciplined over-
abundance of description implies
that the writer does not know or
that he is cowardly in admitting
how expansive his feelings are--
creating a new category of expres-
sion. Mr. Jones has not re-ﬁled
his uneasy experience in a war
novel, nor/ is it completely an
heroic poem. It is, rather, some
’category arising from the post-
war period yet remaining an un-
pleasant synthesis in that ‘it re-
tains its direction back towards all
three of its parts.

Ball's Story

As a novel the book tries to tell
the story of Pvt. John Ball’s part
in the war from his arrival to his
injury in the ﬁeld.

A seemingly perfect position
is taken to attack the story.
The story is to be told from
the character’s reactions and ob-
servations to his situation; the
reader is not to be helplessly
fed the story interpretation but
is to be made asresponsible as
Pvt’. Ball for the climax and
perceiving the insight that jus-
tiﬁes the writing. But that is
only the theory.

In practice, however, there is
such a profusion of observations
and reactions that the reader loses
the story’s plan and defiantly be-
gins to construct his own. This
confusion‘ could have been avoid-
ed if Mr. Jones had a different
View towards dialogue. To him
dialogue is used less for. defining
the speakers than for setting
scenes and a tone or’ a mood.

not step any nearer than th e

ally above the night watch ready
to be rung as a gas alarm.

Achieves

Limited Acceptance

By ED ROBERSON .
In 1937’s England, David Jones published In Parenthesis
country by Chilmark Press ($5.75).
This is one of those books that achieves the kindly “limited
acceptance” not because it succeeds, but because it is ﬁrst

To suggest a reason for Mr. Jones’ attempt to present
the First World War the way he9 

of the author’s war experience
except that the absence of any
relief by incident or through
timing never gives the reader
the impression that the writer
is in control.

The flatness loses such start-
lingly bizarre images as that of
the‘ soldier directly in front of
Ball who suddenly lifts into the
air — then drops as,Ball .steps
mechanically into his track that
the rain has not yet had time to
ﬁll.

Unimportant Death

The lack of character develop-

ment makes his death unimpor-

tant, but the fact that the image.

is buried in windmill descriptions
and allusions leaves it almost un-
noticed and without relevance to
any sequence.

Poetry is the only literary
form excused from sequence.
The denial of time, the building
of a simultaneity between a GI
and Childekoland is purely the
property of poetry. In Parenthe-’
sis looks like a poem. It has line _

~ endings functioning as indica-

tors of intensity or -modifiers,
complex images and allusions
and notes whose erudition rivals
Eliot's.

But even poetry cannot condone

amass of merely beautiful images,

that do not move. Even in poetry,
the destruction of sequence is used
only to intensify an insight, not as
scholarly and precious ornamen-
tation. The joy of ornament is
that it hangs on something, is not

merely itself. And it is here that '

In Parenthesis fallsshy of being
a poem. It is, a museum ‘of feel-
ings and baubles of scholarship.)

_'izine have gone to unusual
"lengths to bring to the attention

A ptober issue of

' t anthropologist
M a r g a r e t
jMead,. the col-
~‘un‘_in is blunt-
;-ly entitled
, {Sex on the
[7Campus; The
Real’ Issue.”
 Mead apparently felt com-
gpelled to write the. article as a
5ﬁre”sult of the wide controversy
last spring when a poll showed
 that only about half of the stu-
B dents at Vassar College agreed
 with ‘the school’s president,
‘Sarah Blanding, who held that
’i'{fpremarit2il‘sexua1 relations and
excessive dringing are indecent
and immoral.”
V. _l The social scientist feels, how-
 ever, that in the nation-wide
_.furor which followed the sur-
,prising statistics of the poll, the
-_ real issue escaped comment. She

states that her research has ze-
 vealed that today's society is not
A so much concerned with immor-
ality or indecency as it is with
fpregnancy. ' "
 And spry Peg has again shown
that not only does she know
 about Growing Up in Samoa, but
jshe knows as much as anyone

about
- American society.

On The Head

For her analysis shows that she
has struck the nail right on the
' head--the maidenhead. She has
_ found that in the past 25 years,
1:,American colleges have increas-
ingly rustled out of their bustles
not Victorianism and that “ . . .
the whole country was experi-
'encing a new moral alignment
.’ . .‘In this new morality the
5 idea is accepted, without explicit
statement, that premarital sex

 

’ in ‘marriage. This is related to

the increasing acceptance of
early marriage subsidized by
parents.”

. She adds that the country “has
. ..slipped into a position of ac-
cepting the idea that the most
important thing in the world is
to get young people, boys and
girls, married. Premarital sex
and premarital conception, as a
means to this end, have become
’ acceptable.” '

 And Dr. Mead ends her
damning charges at the new
jrnorality of America by sum-
'.«ma'rizing that _“a girl and a boy

 New Morality . . . ? C
The Pregnant Couple
 C‘ By Matthew Nesvisky—_-—-4_

The editors of Redbook Maga— ‘

the vital problems of‘

4 *7is'a11 right provided that it ends "

nant, they can get married, with

'everyone’s blessing. /What we are

dealing withtoday is not a preg-
nant girl but a pregnant couple,

effectively blackmailing a soci-ll

ety that has only reluctantly ac-
cepted sex as good, even in mar-
riage.”

Too true, wise Margaret, too
true. The last pillar of ;fear---
the main support of morality——is
crumbling at the base. For when

“Penelope Pure returns home for

Christmas vacation suspiciously
big-bellyed, she knows thatsure,
Pop will down a triple Bourbon
and Mom will twist her apron,
but ultimately, they will get her

married and moneyed right
quick. Or when Billy Button-
d0W1'l ‘ﬁnally calls long-distance
to-make the Big Confession to

the folks, he knows that after *

the dressing down, arrangements
will soon‘ be made with his vic-
tim’s parent’s and their favorite
parson. '
Hell of a Relief

And that’s all one hell of’a’re-
lief for the parents because .“it’s_
over and done with at last and
they know _a-ll about sex now
and thank heavens we didn’t
have to explain it to them all
and they’re __married now and
have their own problems and
we can ﬁnally quit worrying and
give me that triple Bourbon."

Dr. Mead also jabs out with
her opinion that “the avoidance
of premarital sex relations” is
only “honored in word alone”
today. Is this because society has
progressed to the point where it
can no longer control its youth?
Could it ever? I think not. To
pa rap h ras e a contemporary
American writer, the last gen-

eration engaged in as much sex-*.

ual activity as the present one
does; only it didn’t talk about
it as much.

It would appear then that the
only courses of actions for to-
day’s students are to either viii-
raculously discover some fool-
proof method of abstention or to
limit their sexual promiscuity to
partners who could, in a pinch,
become acceptable husbands or
wives. ‘

 Me?redi’rh Mish

 

By .Viiay Jain

Having dealt the death blow "to the Ole’ Miss
segregation policy in the much talked about and
publicized Meredith case, President Kennedy has
come out smelling of roses and now- seems to be
poised to accept the plaudits
from the world press.

Yet, upon closer examination
of the situation, I could not see
any other course of action he
could have ‘taken on the issue.
His “ﬁrm stand” and his nation-
wide radio-television broadcast _’
however leaves something more
to be desired.

Instead of scolding a high of-
ficial of the State Government _
who behaved like a mismanaged .

 

B child, the President seemed to display timidness

and seemed to deem it necessary to sing the

praises of Mississippi’s great cultural past and

military geniuses.

Thus, just about the time he was issuing pleas
to the persons involved to act their age, riots broke
out on Ole’ Miss campus and resulted in the death
of a foreign‘ correspondent, and one of the ex-
generals seemed ready to start the Civil War anew.

Surely, the massed Amilitary‘ forces and the.

F,‘ederalized"National Guards could have prevented
such an occurance. ’

Even now that Meredith is enrolled and attend-

ing classes the strife is by no: means over. Gov-
ernor Barnett, in a statement issued, that they are
surrounded on all sides by the U. S. forces, but
they would carry on the ﬁght and oppose the.ad-
mission of -Meredith in the courts. Then there is
the trial of General Walker, not to mention the
question “what will:-happen when the three U. S.
marshals stop escorting Meredith to his classes?”
Bigofryond Racism

Were all these problems to be resolved satisfac-‘V

torily, Mr. Kennedy would still be presumptous to
expect to have .the books closed on the issue
“quickly and quietly.” Soviet Union’s Tass News

agency has already‘ lashed ‘the University of Mis- '

sissippi as being the stronghold of Bigotry and
Racism and the Red Chinese agency Pei-Ping said
that terrorists against the Negro people are mount-

ing with "connivance”. from the U. S. government.

The controversy, however, will not end with
this, during the weeks and months to follow, the
“dead from the grave” will be resurrected time and
again by the Communist block to demonstrate to
the nonaligned nations and the emerging nations
of Africa the evil’ deeds of the capitalists.

I know they were able'to use the Little Rock
incident with advantage for over two years.‘

The point that arises is not whether what
Governors Barnett and Faubus did‘ was right, for
most Americans know that to be false, but why
should such incidents occur at all. ‘

To quote from the Munich Sueddeutsche
Zeitung, “The American Civil War ended with the
defeat of the slave owners but the effects of slavery
were not overcome.” The recent incident seems
to substantiate the theory. Are we then to assume
that the Civil War was not really won by the North
and that the one nation under God with Liberty’

and Equality for all shall perish from the face 

of the earth? ,

_ The premise seems too frightful even‘ to con-
sider, but if a more positive action is not taken
by the present and the succeeding administrations,
this could very possibly happen. If the nations -in
Africa and the “colored” people in Asia were to

‘move towards the red block, the Red, While and

Blue could not survive inspite of their H-bomb and
missles. ‘
"Persuasion" Policy ,
I believe Mr. Kennedy should not wait for a
crisis to develop to take- any action; instead he
should fulﬁll one of his campaign promises and
“take the bull by the horns” now. It is not suffi-

cient for him to resign his-membership at the Cos- if

mopolitan Club? in Washington, D. Cf, because a
Negro is refused admission, but he should use ‘This
inﬂuence to ,“persuade” the "policy of -‘the club to
be changed.

The‘. Negro’s ‘civil rights in the South are -still‘
being ignored by the ‘States, and it is up -to the’

federal government to have them» stringently "en-'
forced. ‘

Some'moderists advocate that in the due ‘course
of time the segregation problem will resolve’ by
itself. A century has elapsed since the Civil War 4--
how much longer .mus't ‘ students like Meredith
wait for their education?

Churches

and Chips

By Stan Stein

V “No, I" don’t go to church every Sunday, ‘or.
even every other Sunday. Sometimes I won’t go

for six or seven weeks in a row, and other times
l’ll go three or four weeks in succession. I bet
a quarter.”  A V '
“A quarter on three diamonds? Well, I'll have
to keep you honest. I’ll see ya’.
But why do you go at all? Don’t
you feel sort of —— ah — hypo-
critical if you don’t go every

“No, I don’t feel hypocritical.

haven’t been in over two years.”

“How come you don’t go?”

“It just made me nauseous to see all the people
who come maybe once every ﬁve months drive up
in their Caddies to show off their minks and
diamonds.”

“Man, I know just what you mean.
same way at our church. Whose deal is it?”

“My deal. Five stud, jacks to win. You guys
get a little ridiculous sometimes. You pick up this
college fad of not going to church or temple and
you make like it is a long held, profound belief.”

“Look, Charlie, you can go to church every
Sunday if you want to and I’ll never kid you or
ridicule you about it. I just ask the same courtesy
of you, OK? I'm entitled to my own beliefs as
long as they don’t interfere with yours, right?”

“Take it easy A1. It’s only a discussion. Whose
bet is it?”— -

“It’s your bet. OK, Al, what are your beliefs?”

believe it should be taken literally. or was meantto
be taken literally.”

“King high checks. But you’ve got to believe in
something. Every person should believe in some-
thing.” ? ‘ . _

' “I believe in something. I believe in myself
and I believe in man. It’s not an egotistical belief.
I just believe that man should get credit for "the
things he does, not God, ‘and I believe the man

could go to temple on the idea that there may be
something in it, but I don’t think there is. Look,
let’s just get on with the game. Pair of tens bets.”
“Pair of tens checks to four "clubs." ‘

Bible idea, but" even if there is no Godup there

their own two feet more instead of trusting to

“Hey, com’on. Let’s. just play the game.”

“Anyone beat queens up?” .

“Nope, it’s all yours. Alright, Charlie, we’ll

forget about the need for security. The point is’
that as times change, religions have to change. If
they don’t,’ they die.”

“Hey, Al, your deal, baby.”

“Oh, sorry. Seven stud lo-ball.”

“OK, Al, I’ll agree to your last point. But then
we come down to the old question of how every-

"It Goes On..."

THE VASTWASTELAND
WACO, Texas, the site of Baylor Un'iversity’s campus,

 has to be an experimental project to see how people’ will
1- -, react to life after nuclear warfare.

It is one of the few ‘places in the world, ‘save for perhaps ,

Bonneville Flats, Utah, where one‘ can search the horizon

" V for miles and see nothing.

The football team made quarters at the Holiday Inn,
which is about four miles from downtown Waco. The
maid. who was cleaning my room cou1dn’t devulge the
gay spots in the town for she hadn’t been there in four
years.

After I visited the town I realized why she hadn’t been
there for four years. Even if she had, she couldnt have

‘released the names of any gay spots —— there are none.

The local chamber of commerce boasts that the town
has 100,000 people, but they must count the bugs which

Ghost Town

After 7 p.m.‘no one walks the streets of Waco. It’s
simply a ghost town. At noon time everybody walks the
street, and it’s still a ghost town.

Walking along‘ the sidewalk at night is akin to survey-
ing a cockroach-ridden flat on the lower East Side of New
York. Locusts spring ankle-high at every storefront.

The insects persistently bang against the lighted
windows till they crack their craniums and die. They
must ﬁgure it’s the only way to get out of Waco.

Only two places in the town serve mixed dI'll’l,kS7 3n_d
they’re the canned variety. Near-beer .IS the only alcoholic
mixture in, the community except for the bloodstreams of
the Northern tourists.

Nowhere in the town can you secure gift items bearing
any kind of Waco emblem on them. The shop owners must
be smart enough to realize that only football teams with
no-cut contracts would visit the town. , j
Snap, Crackle, Pop ’

They have few sidewalks. They ﬁgure the horses aren’t
particular. A friend and I walked 20 blocks along the medial

, strip of a four-lane highway for fear that we would be eaten

alive along the roadside.

The cars passing over the locust-cluttered highway
sounded like they w'ere driving on a surface of rice
crispies. .

A Pitt professor who graduated from Baylor says they’re
the locusts of the Bible. “Boy, when they hit the town,” he
said, “everything goes.” I conclude that they must have
come and gone a few times by’now. '

NEW THREAT — Sophomore halfback, Bill Bodle
(30). of Deerfleld, Ill., proved his mettle under
game conditions against Baylor and he’s pushing
for a higher rating in practice drills this week.

Blocking Leads Attack
’ By Ron SMIZIK ’

Coach John Michelosen’s new look Panther gridders will
seek their second win of the season when‘ they face Califor-
nia’s Golden Bears Saturday at Berkeley, California.

The new look on the team is the vicious offensive block-
ing that opened gaping holes in the Baylor line that enabled

Panther ball carriers to pick up large chunks of yardage
with each carry. ' ' 9
Good blocking will make any
offense work whether it be the
most razzle dazzle in the land or
of the drab, unimaginative variety
—which certainly does not de-
scribe the Panther’s offense.
Whether this crisp blocking
will hold up against California’s
heavier line remains to be seen.
Many Injuries

If they are to upend the Bears
the Panthers will have to do it
without the services of starters
Chuck Ahlborn and John Jenkins
and second-unit quarterback, Fred
Mazurek.

All three were injured against
Baylor and are expected to miss
the California game.

Ahlborn’s place will be ably
taken by Marty Schottenheimer
whose blocking was outstanding
last week. Getting someone to.
back up Schottenheimer is more
of aiproblem for the coaches.

Holzbach Needed

It is hoped that John Holzbach,
a letterman in 1960, but a disap-
pointment last year, will be able
to shake an injury and play. If
not, Paul Kisiday or John Cullen,
untried sophomores, will have to
fill in. '

Bob Long will return to the
right end spot he held against
Miami as a replacement for

a toss-up between. Fran Novak
and Sam Colella to see who takes
Mazurek's place.

a little more. Lehner will still be
used as (Jim) Traﬁcant’s replace-
ment on defense, though.”

California has no such quar-
terback problem. Randy Gold
does anexcellent job of leading
the offense and he is adequately
backed up by Larry Balliett,

Jets Power-Packed With

Scorers

Akron Booters Return

By FRED

MARCUS ‘

Akron University, the defending Ohioq_C_onference, soccer

champions, are slated to meet

the varsity soccermen at 1:30

p.m. Saturday in the Stadium, hopeful of reversing a_ 4-3

loss in 1961.

' The Jets, fresh from a win over’ defending national

champion, St. Louis, University,9
last year, bowed to the rallying
efforts of Panther‘ Corky Cu.th-
bert, who ram-
med two goals
into the nets in
the last quar-
ter.

The Panthers
trailed,'3—2, go-
ing into that‘
period. The
team. has beat-
en the Jets on
two other oc-
casions in Ak-
ron, too. But -
they have been whipped, 4-3, and,
8-0, when they were the home
team.

Three men form the hub of the
Akron team. Pete Milich, an out-
side right, scored 30 goals last
year, including two against the
Panthers. By comparison the
Panthers -only scored 21 goals as’

 

Leo Bern is

Fritz Kungl, an All-America
halfback, and Frank Abel, center
forward, are the other two threats.
This trio racked up 55 goals in
1961. . I

“They always like to beat us,’_’
said Coach Leo Bemis. “So we
look on them‘ with great respect.
Our team is just going to have to
be determined to beat them.”

Editor Takes I ’
Dive In Yogi

Editor M a tt “Nostradamus”
Nesvisky must have ‘looked into

"I '7 a bowling ball instead of a crys-

tal ball last week. He not only
picked Baylor to ‘win, ‘but chart-
ed a 2-11 mark, the worst record
in the history of The Pitt News
Yogi.

Sports Editor Jim O’Brien and
defending champion Bob Smizik
continue to wrestle for_the head
spot, both registering 9-4 marks
to remain tied for the lead. “See,
he’s fading already,” Smizik ex-
claimed.

Coach Frank Lauterbur. also
posted a 9-4 mark to put the
coaches intothird place. “I just

‘had a strong hunch we’d beat

Baylor,” he said. Quarterback
Sim Traﬂcant whipped up an 8-5
record to salvage‘ the fourth spot.

Art Fleischner, upset over
Sammy’s loss in «the -fraternity
softball loop, ﬁoundered again.
“It will be my only bad week of
the year,” he proclaimed. Jean
Snyder, a sophomore math major,
will try to improve on Barbara
Dudreck’s 7-6 mark in the female‘
ranks. -

WHAT TO WEAR TILL THE DOCTOR COMES.

Now that you have enrolled and paid your (fees and bought
your books and found your way around campus and learned to
hate your roommate, it is time to turn to the most importan
aspect of college life. I refer, of course, to clothes. ‘
What-does Dame Fzisliioii decree for the coming school year?
(Incidentally, Dame Fashion is not, as many people believe, a
ﬁctitious character. She was a real Englishwoman who lived in
Eliza.bethan times and, indeed, England is forever in her debt.

During the invasion of the Spanish Armada, Dame Fashion--- -

not yet a Dame but a mere, unlettcred country lass named

Moll ‘Flanders—-during the invasion, I say, of the Spanish -.

Armada, this dauntless girl stood on the white cliffs of Dover
and turnedthe tide of battle by rallying the drooping morale of
the British ﬂeet with this stirring poem of her own composition:

Don’t be gutless,
M en of Britain.
Swing your outlast,
We a.z'-n’t quittiin’.

' Smash the Spanish,
Si-nk their boats,
Make ’em vanish,

Like a horse‘ makes oats.

. For Good Queen Bess, 4.
Dear _sirs, you gotta
' Make a mess
Of that Armada.
You won’t fail!
Knock ’em flat! . ‘
Then we’ll drink ale
And stuﬁ like that.

As a reward for these inspirational verses Queen Elizabeth
dubbed her a Dame, made her Poet Laureate, and gave her
the Western Hemisphere except Duluth. But this was not the
extent of Dame Fashion’s service to Queen and country. In
1589 she invented the laying hen, and she was awarded a life-
time pass to Chavez Ravine. But she was not to end her days
in glory. In 1591, alas, she was arrested for overtime jousting
and imprisoned for thirty years in 8. butt of malmsey. This later
became known as Guy Fawkes Day.)

But I digress. Let us get back to campus fashions. Certain to
be the rage again this year is the cardigan (which, curiously
enough, was named after Lord Cardigan, who commanded the

‘ English ﬂeet against the Spanish Armada. The sweater is only

one product of this remarkable Briton’s imagination. He also
invented the" glottal stop, the gerund, and the eyelid, without
which winking, as we know it today, would not be possible).

But I digress. The cardigan, I say, will be back, which is, I
believe, cause for rejoicing. Why? Because the cardigan has
nice big pockets in which to carry your Marlboro Cigarettes-
amd that, good friends, is ample reason for celebration as all of
you will agree who have enjoyed Marlboro’s ﬁne, comfortable,
‘mellow flavor. and Marlboro’s ﬁlter. So why don’t you slip into
your cardigan and hie yourself to your tobacconist. for some
good Marlboros? They come in soft pack or ﬂip-top box. Cardi-
gans come in pink for girls and blue for boys. 01992 M-xﬁh-vl-no
