Fulton Discusses Tariff
At International Club

 

James A. Fulton of Mclieesport.
discussed the evolution of the tariff
and its importance in economic af-
fairs at the meeting of International
Relations club Monday. Mr. '-Fulton
emphasized the rise and decline of
the mercantilistic system, and the
establishment of trade balances.

Commenting on the attitude of the
United States in regard to the tariff
balances, he said, “VVe,have devel-
oped the American system, or a pro-
tective plan of limiting our purchases
to those things which we cannot pro-
duce or manufacture at home. ‘Due
to a change in the European systems,
our trade balance has slumped to al-
most nothing. We cannot hope for a
favorable balance of trade in future
years. as the economic interests at
home and abroad will prevent it.”

Educational Displays

 

Upon presentation of their registra-
tion cards, students in the University
will be permitted to see the educa-
tional exhibits of colleges in the Pitts-
burgh region, and demonstrations of

‘Secret Of Life Remains
Unsolved,’ Hance, Says ’
In Reviewing Year

The year 1934 began and will end
with the problem of the ages——the

secret of life——-still unsolved, undis-

covered and undeﬁned. is life mech-
anistic or vitalistic? Does it pro-
ceed along more or less well-deﬁned
paths or is it a plaything of fate?

Zoologists. though as perplexed as
ever over this point, are gradually ap-
proaching a solution. According to Dr.
Robert T. Hance, head of the depart-
ment of zoology, this is a question
“which everyone would like to answer
but of which only the rash would at-
tempt to predict the outcome.” _

“Each new truth,” Dr '. Hance 5x-
plaincd, “whether it concerns an ani-
mal so unimportant in our daily lives
as the amoeba, or whether it cor.-
cerns man directly, tends sooner or
later to bring the phenomena of life
to more understandable levels.

“The goal of zoology a.nd the zoolog-
ist is a knowledge of living mechan-
ics, the result of which is greater
physical and mental comfort.”

Looking back over the develop-
ments in zoological ﬁelds the past
year, Dr. -I-lance saw a. “steady ad-
vance along all lines” with nothing
“sensational” standing out during the
year. ‘ ,
“We have progressed in every di-
rection," he said, “but it has been a

year more of developing old discov-

eries rather than ﬁnding new and sen-
sational facts.''’

The zoologist regarded the research
with chromosomes, tiny parts of the
nuclei of cells which are the cause of
redhair and blue eyes. as possibly
the 'leading =":development..  . the —D«f1Sl-
year. ' " '

Special processes have been per-
fected which enable more accurate
study of the chromosomes. In the ef-
forts to trace out the extent of her-
edity, these studies will be of incul-
culable beneﬁt, Dr. Hance believes.

Resurrection of the Lazarus dogs
in California is not as yet exciting.
Dr_ ‘Hence said.

“Recently in Russia scientists went
even farther and kept just the head
of a dog alive for quite some time.”

He saw little if anything new in
the methods used to revive victims
of sleeping sickness.

Tomorrow a week the zoology de-
partment opens its exhibit at the
American Association for the Ad-
vancement of Science convention
here. The exhibit, featuring a "Tree
of life, will be on display from
Thursday, December 27, to Sunday
afternoon, December 30, at the Mellon
Institute.

Annual AAAS Convention Will
Inaugurate Public Opening

The big, white stone building across
Belleﬁeld avenue will be put to its
first public use when the American
Association for the Advancement of
Science comes to Pittsburgh next
week for its annual convention_

The convention will be featured by
a scientiﬁc exhibition running from
December 27-30, which is purported to
be the largest ever planned. Dis-
plays touching upon practically every
phase of science as it applies to 20th
century civilization will be offered in
the new ediﬁce. Chemistry, physics,
mathematics, anthropolog’, engineer-
ing, biology, psychology, history and
geology, will all be represented.

Exhibitors and members of the con-
vention will register in the new -build-
ing. Meetings of the groups, -‘based
on their respective ﬁelds, will be held
in the Carnegie museum, and in the
available buildings of the University
and Carnegie Tech.

Dr. F, C. Brown, of Vvashington, D.
C._, commenting on the convention,
writes, “The menibers of the numer-
ous and diverse units of the associa-
tion will find that the objective pre-
sentation of science facilitates com-
mon understanding, purpose, and fel-
lowship.”

During the exhibition, the new In-
stitute home will be thrown open for
inspection. The exhibition itself will
be held (in the ground ﬂoor, although
laboratories on some of the upper
ﬂoors will be ready for examination.
The building will not be dedicated un-
til] next spring, or later, It will be oc-
cupied by the Institute shortly after-

Held Will Visit
Santa Claus

Dr. Omar C. Held, personnel
assistant to the clean of the Col-

ta Claus.

Dr. Held left yesterday to spend
his Christmas vacation in his
home town, Santa Claus, Indiana,
which he claims is the only real
Santa Claus in the world.

Faculty Advisers
Given New Role
In Registration

Students Will Receive Notices
To Apply For Forms After
Christmas Recess

At the beginning of the new year,
students and Registrar John G. Quicl-:’s
office will have an opportunity to try
out the new plan in registrat.ion which
changes the duties of the faculty ad-
viser. The annual mid-semester ad-
vance registration will begin immedi-
ately after Christmas recess.

The plan, recently adopted by the
members of the University registra-
tion committee, requires the student
to make out his own schedule of
classes. The faculty adviser will
serve as counselor only,

provided and the students will be
kept advised of closed sections.

At. present, construction of class
Schedules and the preparation of a
multitude of registration forms by the
office staff offers the annual prelude
to this registration period. During the
recess students will receive from the
registrar notices to apply for their
study lists upon_their return .to. the
campus, Study lists will be distribut-
ed on January 3, 4 a11d 7, and the ad-
visory period will extend from Jan-
uary 3 to 319.

According to Mr. Quick, the ad-
vantages to be derived from the
change in the duties of the faculty
advisers are threefold: First, the ad-
viser will be given more time to serve
as an educational counselor when he
is freed from the clerical labor in-
volved in working“ out schédliles.
Secondly, the student in constructing
his own schedule will naturally be
more careful to avoid conflicts. Third-
ly, it is expected that the time requir-
ed by registration will be reduced be-
cause the usual delay occurring when
a relatively few advisers are required
1.0 construct the schedules of many stu-
dents will be eliminated if each stu-
dent makes his own schedule. New
t'rcsh111en, however, will in all proba-
bilitv be assisted by faculty advisers
in the make-up of their class sched-
ules.

J. Middletd;~Mu;y Will
Speak At YNoon Forum

J. Middleton Murry, author, journal-
ist and writer, will be the third speak-
er in the noon luncheon forum series
under the joint sponsorship of the
YM-W’l-IA and the YM-VVCA at the
YMHA on January 4. Mr. Murry will
speak on “Three Jewish prophets of
the modern world.”

Known as a writer, critic, and jour-
nalist, Mr_ Murry was one of the most
intimate friends of the late D. H.
Lawrence and was the husband of the
late Katherine Mansﬁeld. His best
known books are “The Evolution of.‘
An Intellectual” (1920) and “Keats
and Shakespeare” (1925).

The three Jewish prophets whom
Mr. lVlul‘1'y will consider are Jesus.
Spinoza, and Marx. The address will
begin at 12:45 o’clock_ Tickets are not
necessary except for the lunch, the
price of which is 3.5 cents.

Botany Department Head
Aids In Classifying Plant

Probably the most complete spec-
imen of the plant fossil Neuropteris
rarinervis has recently been classi-
ﬁed by Dr. 0. E. Jennings, head of

the botany department. The plant, a
representative of the coal period.
was uncovered during excavation

work on the athletic ﬁeld on Hershel
street, West End, and brought to Dr.

Jennings’ attention several weeks
ago. With several scientists from
Carnegie museum, he brought the

specimens to the museum, and classi-
fied them.

Another plant, Neoropteris angus-
tifolia, was also found on some of the
smaller slabs. This specimen is of
particular interest in that it shows
the peculiar arrangement of the leaf-
lets on the petioles, unlike anything
known in the living plants of today.

These plants are to be on exhibition
in the Carnegie museum during the
AAAS meetings next week.

interests are created, but with the
pure and lofty sen ‘merits of certain
ﬁne men—opiuions which in the last
resort determine the actions of our
government.

VVe ﬁnd ourselves just outside the
Senate chain-ber_ The Senate has re-
cessed for several minutes to allow
the senators relief from their labors.
Two Senators are sitting in comforta-
ble chairs. The others are pacing back
and forth V‘.-'e. have a remarkable
feeling that they are standardized. But
then we remember that Senators are
much the same. They all have ample
girths and gray hair. They all puff at
tat cigars.

’l‘hc gentlemen are all accustomed
to oratory, and at a spot so close to
the scene of action, they are unable
to converse without recourse to
speech-making, The Senator from Q
has been pacing back and forth. Final-
ly he stops, withdraws the. cigar from
his mouth, rolls it around in his lips,
inhales deeply. He clasps his hands
behind his back and begins in this
fashion:

La-xity Of Our Morals

“The whole trouble today is that
we have forsaken the ways
ancestors. VVe have engaged in prac-
tices which are contrary to the Divine
Will. We have led fast lives, we liave
been lax in morals, we have forsaken
the standards of our fathers. And so
we are punished. W315 not Rome pun-

tion of the human heart is what we
need. In it alone lies our chance. We
must cling again to the ideals of our
ancestors. both political and moral.”

says boldly, “you’re wrong. This re

That just won’t work. Do you think

with you, though, about the ideals of
our ailcestors. There’d be no silly
talk about drafting wealth for war if
we followed them.”
Socialism On Horizon
“W'ell, at least we
sentials.” says the Senator from Q.
But the Senator from X is stirred.
He is ‘tl'lllll(ll‘-._9C of the business of the
moment. “Take this war proﬁt bill.
It's like the bank bill. VVe are run-

Youth Dares To Criticize:

The Senator from X once started is
hard to stop. We knew from the way
be screwed up his face and chewed his
cigar while the other Senator was
speaking that he must be thinking
deeply. He voices a profound
thought, “A great deal of our trouble
comes from these radicals. But just
comes from college pro-
fessors, who are constantly meddling
in politics, of which they know noth-

Any other Senator breaks in. “Don’t

Again the Senator from X breaks in.
“'l‘hat’s the only wise thing to do.

government; they overthrow our in-
stitutions They attempt to strike

ment. My son is going into business.

And the Senator from Q still in-
sists: “Yes, but we must not forget
our ideals.” As they both pass
throiurh the door, their voices become
fainter. VVe are just able to make out
some of the words of a single sen-
tence: “Our ideals, look what they
have done in the past and . .”

We leave happy. The Senate is in
its chambers and all’s right with the

sleighgand with a wave of his hand
ﬂicked-the teamback home. He’
glanced about him, and smiled as he
recoignized the top of the Cathedral,
with its turrets and balustrade, and-
grcy limestone showing through the
thin layer of snow. He took long
crunchy steps to the railing, peered
over the top toward Alumni hall, and

snow melted, and more came, and it
too melted. Darkness fell about him,
then bright daylight returned. He
took no account of the time as it sped
past him, for he looked through roofs
with a magical gaze and deeply drank
of the life beneat.h his view:

A car stopped. at the curb before
the PAA. The’ lights died ahd a young
man hurried around to assist a girl
to the sidewalk. It was cold, and so
they hurried into the building, The
man atop the Cathedral smiled and
followed them. Thecouple stepped
into the warm lobby and laughed,
looking deeply into each other's eyes.
The boy checked the cloaks and arm
in arm the two mounted the circular
stairs, their feet noiseless on the pad-
ded steps.

At the same time, down at the Billie
Penn, other couples beganto march
in, the girls cautious in formals, the
boys rigid in dress uniforms. Vvhite
mess jackets" and blue suits looked
neat with long pink and green and
white ribbons trailing about. Drifting
about the Urban and Silver rooms,
the Pitt Riﬂes put on a miniature Mil-
itary ball. Santa. Claus ‘ rubbed his
own cold cheek and-grimaced  a
couple started to glide across the

Hours later, the two dance crowds
met at a downtown restaurant and
fought for possession of the two-by-
four dance floor, the ‘formality of the
uniforms weakened by the mingling
serges and browns. “No,” Santa de-
cided, “I’m not needed there.”

He glanced over to a room on Craig
street, where, beside a small Reznor.
a boy in pajamas was whacking at a
typewriter in brief energetic spurts.
“A week from today, Mother, and I’ll
be eating at your table, hearing your
voice‘, telling you .” Santa sur-
veyed the room. Just a double cot in

one corner, a chiffonicr in another,
the combined table and desk, and the
small stove stood out. But the feeling
of comfort pervading the box made
Santa turn, though hesitatingly, away.
“I don't think I’m needed there,” he
considered.

At the fraternity house farther up
the street, .a dim light in__the lower

hall was the only thing to denote life,

except for the lighted window in the
rear third floor room. The house was

perfectly quiet. In bedrooms, the cots‘

were burdened with trousers and dirty
shirts, and damp towels hung from the

bedstcads. Books were jumbled on
the desks, papers strewn around
them.

In the third ﬂoor room, Mrs. ‘Wil-

liams sat beneath a bridge lamp,
slowly knitting a sleeve. The work
demanded attention, one . . . two

moment down to Pii.tsburgh’s slums.
Humph! Then over to the home for
the aged, where three old women sat
together. “When I was at Cheyenne,

“Yes, you told us about that," the
other two acidly croaked, and the
three were silent. hating and «hating.
Santa Claus looked with some scorn
at the hou_semotli‘er; but then con-
scientiously rang the telephone.

Mrs. Vvillianis hurried down the
stairs, her skirts held high in her
right hand, while her left grasped the
railing. “Hello,’ she panted, “Yes.
You are? Fine! I'll be ready.” Santa
nodded his head with a certain ﬁnality
to the gesture. . I

In front of the apartment, a car
stopped a.nd from the back seat a
young couple got out. “Thanks Char-
lie," the girl in white called; “Good-
night, Ruth,” the boy said. They
walked under the awning and into the
warmth. At the door to the apart-
ment, the boy counted. out the pro-
gram, the purse, and the gloves.
"I/Vell, I guess we can't go together
now until you come back after the
holidays,” the boy frowned_ ‘

“That’s right,” the girl's low
whisper replied. ‘
“Gee, Tay . .” Santa heard him

mutter, and looked away; he wasn’t
needed there, either. Santa Claus
clucked to the team and with a scorn-
ful smile at Oakland, moved down to
the city.

Win Two In Mid-West

After a hectic trio of battles in the
mid-west « this past week-end, the
Panther basketeers returned to Pitts-
burgh this morning to enjoy a vaca-
tion.

Their holiday will not last long,
however, for as soon as the Christmas
greetings and presents have been ex-
changed among relatives and friends,
the cagers will begin practicing for
the coming encounter with VV_isconsin_
Coach Carlson's‘ men will face the
Badgers on December 29 at Madison,
\Visconsin. .

This game will wind up the Pan-
ther’s animal invasion of the mid-
west.

Get Revenge At Butler

Barely failing’ to double the score
on a team that licked them handily
last year and which was supposed to
he a ﬁne ball club this season, the
Panthers concluded their mid-western
invasion Monday night with a. 42-22
victory over Butler university at In-
dianapolis.

Once again the Pitt ﬁve started off
slowly, allowing Butler to run up a
lead of 9-1. Six baskets in rapid suc-
cession brought a change in the order
of things, with Pitt leading 13-9. But-
ler forged ahead once more at 14-13,
but Hughes, -Cribbs, and Emrick got
the range then and the Panthers were
nevermore headed; ‘ ‘ '

The second half was all Pitt, the
Panthers putting on an extended
scoring spree while Butler banked in
only enough baskets to count ﬁve
points. Skip Hughes and Ross Em-
rick led the scorers, each getting a
total of 10 points Skip had three ﬁeld
goals and four fouls, while Emrick
made ﬁve ﬁeld goals.

Cribbs and the gentleman known as
High Noon managed to control the
ball throughout most of the game and
kept the Bulldogs of Butler very
much in check_

The victory was Pitt’s second out
of three starts on the annual mid-
western invasion, bettering last year's
record for the same series by one won
ball game.

_At the half the Panthers had in-

at a disadvantage in height and the
loss of their star center, Ivan Black-
mer, who was ejected on a personal
foul in the second quarter, the
Hawkeyes endeavored vainly to pen-
etrate Pitt’s strong defense.

Iowa narrowed the margin to '22 to
14 at the start of the ﬁnal period, but
the Golden Panthers, led by Roderick
and Hughes, increased their lead to
31 to 16 with 10 lminutes left to play.
At this period of the contest the

Pitt Teams Dominate Many
Fields Of Collegiate
Sports This Year‘

VVith but one more athletic contest
for the Panthers remaining on this
year's books, the Pitt News delves
back among its ﬁles t.o rehash the
highlights of the sports activities in
the year just passing.

When 1934 burst fresh and clean
upon us, it was basketball that was
hogging the spotlight. Most memora-
ble was that game here with Notre
Dame, when the Carlson cagers came
from way behind in the second half

to write finis to a 22-game Irish vic-'

tory streak, winning by a 39-3-1 mar-
gin. . .

‘Who can .forget. the night Slim
Wainio, the Duquesne jinx, was ﬁnal-
ly jinx enough to down the Dukes?
The slender one tallied seven points
in a last quarter spurt to win the
marbles.

Coach Olson interspersed an indoor
track championship here in the pro-
gram and his entries smashed no less
than 14 records in’ a murderous as-
sault that afternoon.

ove-r the Christmas holiday in prepa-

With both leagues observing the
holiday tonight, and ’1‘uesday’s

in League. “A.” Phi Gamma Delta,
with a record of five matches to one
for a percentage of .833, offers the
only threat to these league-leadiI:.:_:
