age, andis enrollMed in the School of
Dentistry, where he V-is. learning to
guard against the attacks on Vmolars,
as well as he Moan guard against an
athletic foe‘. His first Matllletic experi-
ences were known-when heplayed
football and" basketball at -Homestead
High Sch_ool,'from which institution he
graduated in 1915.. While at _ high
school he played football Vfol‘ ' Mfour
‘years and ‘captained the te‘aln;M‘in- his
junior andsenior Myea.rs. NI-le played
basketball there for four. years and

_ ‘captained the team in'hi's last; year.

Then he came to Pitt and was elected
captain of the Freshman Basketball
team of 1916. Uncle Sam then called
for-him and. he went. He enlisted in
théMM§-iléifantry, but wanted something
mo _V,.“”..‘excilting, so he was transferred
to the‘ air service, where he remained
for one and one-half years and re-
ceived his commission as second. lieu-
tenant. When the war was "over, he
returned tozhis Alma Mater’ to ﬁght
her battles on the athl'etic ﬁeld-..:l-Ie
‘did this well, for it will be. re-
membered .that he was thestar guard
‘on the football team of 1919, and he is
‘the man who has so jealously guarded
VPitt’s goal .on- the basketball ﬂoor this
year. ' , V

He is 22 years old and is a. studentin

coming to Pitt he represented Brad-

four years and in’ football ‘for four
years and in baseball for three years.
He was center on the ﬂoorteam ‘and
’captain in his rt-hird year. He was a
half-back. on the‘ ‘football, team, and
was captain his" sophomore year. He
was BraMddock’s s_tar short-stop on the
