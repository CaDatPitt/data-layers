-Chavez Asks for “Union Solidarity",
I Speaks on Non-violent Approach

The national director of the
United Farm Workers (UFW)
Union asked for “union solidarity”
in support- of the lettuce boy-
cott sponsored by his organiza-
tion and reaffirmed the union’s
non—vio1ent approach , toward the
achievement of its goals. Cesar

to gain support for the boycott.

The boycott is designed to force

February can be a time of year
when students feel particularly
pressed. Exams are coming‘up.
The winter is bleak, and the holi-
days seem far away.

To accommodate this time of
year and its tensions, Dr. Eliza-
beth Rogoff, psychologist at the
Student~Health Service, is setting
up a small booth in Schenley Hall
for the convenience of students to
come, rap or gripe.

The booth mimicking Lucy in
the Peanuts comic strip will re-
semble a lemonade stand and have
the set fee of five cents a patient
during the winter mid-term per-

vmiod. The major difference will be

that while Lucy hands out her own
brand of caustic counseling; Rog-
off intends to congenially listen
and talk with students to bring a

new understanding or perspective .

to their problems.

“The short term interview will
be like a shot in the arm. The stu-

on you use to win a struggle. We
are convinced that with non-vio-
lence you build and with building
you win. _

The accumulation of power was

seen as the only way to force the
growers to bargain with the UFW.

-Chavez said, “People criticize us

as power seekers. But these same

people are the ones who hold the V
power now and are afraid we will "
take some of it away fromthem." ,

_He’declared that the UFW _has
the right to conduct labor strikes
despite a contrary court decision
in Salinas, Calf., and wil1‘contin-

Sue to participate in strikes regard-

less of the legal consequences.

Chavez is’ certain that an effec-

tive boycott will accomplish its.

goals. He cited the 58‘/2-month
boycott of grapes which resulted

rs Advice;

dent may find that he does not
have such a big problem and he
can handle it,” says Rogoff.

y White Guilt Syndrome .

: w_““*'li"l1eme of ICH Seminar

The Intercultural House is holding its third Black-White Confronta-
tion Seminar on “The White American Guilt Syndrome: Myth or Real-
ity” tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. at the IC House.

I Dr. Robert Colodny, professor of History and Philosophy of Sci-

ence, will be the main speaker.

A panel consisting of Dr. Arthur Tuden, profssor of Anthropology;

' Dr. Samuel Hayes, chairman of the History Department; and Dr. Yu-

of the white American guilt syndrome.

The seminar is part of a continuing series of panel discussions
sponsored by the Intercultural House on racial problems in America.

generate.

He reminded the enthusiastic
audience (numbering about 600
people) of the exploitation of
countless farm workers when-
ever consumers purchase fruits,
nuts, vegetables, and grains.

The booth is intended for short
term therapy and not extended
counseling. It will provide an op-
portunity for students with no ex-
perience with counseling to see
what it may be like.

Information about the other
counseling services will also be
available at thebooth.

“However,” adds Rogoff, “The

I booth is not intended to be a diag-

nostic or referral center, nor as
competition with established Uni-
versity facilities. The objective
is to meet the students’ need for a
listening ear in a convenient
place.”

She adds, “The measure of suc-
cess of the booth will be deter-
mined by whether or not it seem-
ed useful to the students them-
selves. ‘

. Dr. Benjamin Weininger, maned
a similar booth this past Christ-
mas season for the Southern Cali-

'fornia'Counseling Center in Los

Angeles “to dramatize the im-
portance of low cost mental care.”

Stationed at his booth, seeing
two dozen patients a day, Wein-
inger said in the \Jan. 1, 1973. is-
sue of Time magazine, “I have
been listening to everything from
love affairs to conflicts with par-
ents. Some people are surprised
that they can see their problems
in a new light so quickly.”

The five cent counseling booth,
sponsored by Rogoff, is scheduled
to be in the Student Union this
week from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. on
Tuesday, Wednesday’ from noon
to 2 p.m., and Thursday and Fri-
day from 1-1a.m..to1p.m. '

Chavez Brings ‘La Causa’ to Pittsburgh

i by JOHN-AMSON CAPITMAN

Cesar ’ Chavez, National Di-
rector of the United Farm Work.-
ers (UFW), sat at the folding table
in one room of the University and
City Ministries Center, talking
about the struggle —La Causa —
with representatives of the Pitts-
burgh area news media.

He spoke about Monitor 4, an
organic phosphate pesticide, used
by the lettuce growers in the
Yuma and Impreial Vallies of the
Southwest. The chemical, which

_ may be mortally injurious if con-
sumed in too large a quantity, had

been sprayed over all of the sea-
son’s crop, nearly 98 percent of
the national production of lettuce.

Chavez, in a green turtle-neck
and a striking gold evangelical
cross, explained softly, firmly,
that this time the producers of
chemicals had gone “a little too
far.” “This time,” he said, “it
isn’t just the farm workers who
are going to get hurt, it’s every
consumer; and so the Federal
Food and Drug, Administration
an obligation to protect
us all.”

The reports, asked for clari-
fication. Chavez explained that
lettuce sprayed with Monitor 4
is safe if it contains one part/

A million of the chemical, while

the 1,260 boxes of lettuce that
have already been s_eized con-
tain“ anywhere from three to
seven parts/million of the toxic
substance.”

.When asked if this informa-
tion was being released as a
scare tactic, Chavez replied

with an emphatic “No. This is not
a scare tactic, we only believed

that the public has a right to

,know when it is being poisoned

as a result of human error.”

“It’s like a cave-in of a mine,
or a mill-disaster-a combina-
tion of men’s mistakes, the forces
of nature, and the lack of effec-
tively applied legislation to
protect the worker and the pub-
lic as a whole. But you have to
remember that it is our people,
the farmworkers who suffer
most—who have the most contact

with thesepossibly deadly poi-i

sons?’

Later, .Saturday night, after the
press conference, Joseph Odor-
cich made. a comment which

_ didn’t get as much applause from

the audience at the U.F.W. rally
as did many other comments.
He said, as he surveyed an audi-
ence composed of Working peo-
ple from every vocation, students,
teachers, children, and reli-
gious men, “I want the young
people in this audience to re-
member one thing, the greatest
and the bittersweet protest move-
ments, that this country hasever
seen were lead by working
people, trade-unionists who were
looking for a chance at a decent
life, for a chance at the forma-
tion of unions that would make
sure that they got a decent
life.” .

Odorcich, Director of District
15, United Steel Workers, wasn’_t
the only representative of organ-
ized labor to speak on Saturday
evening, he was just one of
many. But his comments, and
yes, even his presence, suggested
the incredible ambiance that the
U.F.W. movement —La Causa —
has. It is a movement in the
tradition of everything that the
American working-man has ever
stood for. It is a movement that
crosses class, religious, and po-
litical lines. _ V

Chavez, speaking to the capa-
city crowd in the Synod Hall on

Craig Street, spoke of the move?

ment in just those terms: ”a move-
ment which crosses every line,
breaks-down every barrier. And
it does it, we do it, because of the
strength of non-violence. Si se
puede — through non-violence we
can.”

This comment, like almost
every other sentence that Chavez
uttered, received enormous ap-
plause. And yet the word applause
is incomplete for it fails to cap-
ture the spirit, the power. gener-
ated by 600 people clapping
in unison, first slowly and then
with increasing speed, and finally
dying into an estatic version
of what Cesar Chavez mildly calls
“television applause.”

The spirit of Saturday night was
awesome. It was something out
of a positive, struggling past that
we have all lost. But perhaps
it was best expressed by a 68-
year old woman—the oldest Farm
Worker Unionist from the D’Ar-
rigo Lettuee‘Farms—who said
(as Chavez translated it) “We are
only looking for what other
Americans have looked for—a
Union, education for our children,
a future, and the right to live
honest lives. And your support
will, hasto, make it possible.”

Saturday night’s spirit was
carried on into Sunday—and will
be carried on ,for muchlonger.
But on Sunday morning, the 60
farmworkers from D‘Arrigo cele-
brated Mass in the Chapel at Du-
quesne University, with a large
congregation of Pittsburghers.

Bishop Leonard, of the Catholic
Archdiocese of Pittsburgh lead
the Mass—as “an expression of
our support for your struggle in

order to promote your just cause
for recognition of what is due to
you, not only as American citi-
zens, but as human beings.”

The Mass, though not well pre- _

pared, nor well enough attended,
was moving in a completely dif-
ferent way than the evening
which preceeded it. What was
stirring here was the grimly de-
termined optimism on the faces of
the Farm Workers.

It didn’t matter that the mass
was given in English, that the
Chapel was lacking flowers, or
.the gaiety of music, both of
which provide the glory of
una misa latino-americana. None
of this mattered because the farm-

workers could sing their own mu-

sic and know their own faith/

well enough that the bare chapel
was sufficient.

On Saturday evening at the press-
conference one reporter asked
about illegal use of the United
Farm Workers ensignia on farm
produce. Chavez’ explained that
the U.F.W. had three cases in
court for just this violation.

Yet, after Saturday night and
Sunday morning one became aware
that the symbol could be copied
but the impressive strength,
the optimism, and the hard realism
of Cesar Chavez and the United
Farm Workers can not be imitated.

- Spring Cleaning

(Continued from Page 1)

The CSO, headed by Dave Wahl
and the SG Board, will meet and
discuss each, group's application.
They will consider such factors as
why the organization is in exis-
tence, how large the membership
is, and how often the meetings are
held. \

The SG Board will then have
the final decision on the official
endorsement of an organization.

The procedures was felt to be
necessary, explained Kaufman
because there are many official
organizations at Pitt with very
few members and infrequent and
irregular meetings. It was “too
easy” for an organization to be
declared official and this caused
musch excess paperwork and a
lack of confidence in CS0.

This project was considered by

last’ year’s SG, but there wasr1_’_t
enough time for it to be carried
out.

Tenure System
Discussed

(Continued from Page I)

A few of the cited problems“ 
were that the present tenure sys- ..

tem is biased in favor of research;
it creates inflexibility in the in-
stitution, and itidepresses faculty
salaries. . ~

Due to the many problems in-
volved in the present system the
suggestion was made that the

Commission put into writing those

questions not in disagreement, as
a non-empirical introductory re-
port. After accomplishing this, the »
Commission felt that it could
move on to study further matters
in detail.

Conference in NY. City

Role of Women Explored

by DEBBIE POPP

The College Art Association, an
organization of historians, pro-
fessors, fine arts librarians, and
studio artists held a conference in
New York City in January inform-
ing its members of research and
fields of inquiry in the arts.

Four sessions of the conference
covered the problems of women
artists and academics'."‘Just two
years ago, one panel was deemed
sufficient to cover the same area
of discussion.

This increased concern in wo-
men in the arts is due. in a large
_\extent to presuring by the C.A.A.
for reinterpretation of women
artists and their subject matter.

The effect of this new inter-
pretation of art was apparent in
a presentation at the conference
by Esther Long of Oregon Uni-
versity on Chinese paintings of
the seventh through thirtenth
centuries. Traditionally, women
represented in settings sugges-
tive of a leisurable, sheltered life
seemed to have accepted thier
restricted lives. At least, the artist
recorded them as docile and un

Yet, contemporary literature
suggests‘-that many of these wo-
men were frustrated-, bored and
lonely. Long contended in her
presentation that “the early Chin-

. ese paintings of‘women illustrates
an important and neglected aspect
of art: while art may reflect social
convention, it also gives them

support. Through harmonious forms.

an aitist may lend dignity and
force to a repressive and de-
humanizing situation.”

In a similar discussion, Ms.
Eunice Lipton of Hunter College
considered the value of social

implications in Manet’s mid
nineteenth century paintings.
ﬁne said, “Manet’s imagery

"of women was

rejected woman as Venus. Flora.
or Mary and dared to depict her
as autonomous, intelligent, self-
possessed, and marvelously down
to earth.”

The general neglect of women
artists by past generations of art
historians was discussdd in a
presentation by Ms. Susan Cas-
teras of Yale University. She cited
that, Eakin scholars have noted
Susan MacDowell Eakins signi-
ficance as her- husband’s help-
mate and moral support. Yet,
they have not given her the
critical attention as Eakins’
male students have received even
though Eskins deemed her one

of the best women painters in the,

entire country.”

To_ guard against such similar
contemporary oversights, Ms. Jan
Changnon, artistand Fine Arts
librarian at Pitt reported, “A
women’s art registrary of slides

‘and names has been organized to

provide access to the,untapped
sourceof good work around.”

The women’s caucus of the
College Art Association, also
held sessions giving advice on
how to get into a show and deal
with an art director. The psycho-
logical problems of maintaining
integrity as a woman in a male
dominated field were discussed
with the related problems ’ of
marriage and children.

Mrs. Elizabeth Booth, librarian,
at Frick Fine Arts Library ap-
praised the active ’women’s move-
ment in the C.A.A. conference
as a “trend that pops up and is
comparable to the influx of black
art a ‘few years ago. It is like a
pendulum swinging wide from
the center and eventually taking

its rightful place.”

Another highlight of the C.A.A.
conference was the three papers
read by faculty of the Fine Arts
Department. Donald E. Gordon.

. professor of Fine Arts and chair-

man of the department gave a
multi-media presentation on Kan-
dinsky's "The Yello Sound: Its
Hidden Imagery." Aaron Sheen.
associate professor of Fine Arts

related the. “Physiognomy, Psycho— . 

therapy, and Caricatures of The
July Monarch."

Ms. Cara Ferguson. a Ph.D.
candidate in the Department
hearing and a Kress Fellow at
the National Gallery of Art spoke
on “The Facade of Saint Gilles
du Gard: Its antique Sources.”

Gordon commented, "The three
papers were well received as ver-
bal presentations and not just
articles.”

Pittsburgh is the proposed site
of the l976'annual College Art
Association conference. At that
time the exhibitions in the com-

pleted Sarah Mellon Scaife Gal-

lery will be a prominent attrac-
tion to the C.A.A. as it gathers
to inform its members of research
and fields of inquiry.

, Intramural competition between the various publications of
a university does not seem to be a worthy topic for discussion.

 ] There has been, however, during the last several weeks an event

that should be noted and commented upon, though humbl_y.
James Kelly, the newly appointed Dean of the School of Ed-

P7 y. ucation who will take the helm on that fine institution toward the
, A beginning of the next month, was recently written up in the Uni-

:3: _ . versity Times. -

We the staff members of the Pitt News applaud the veracity
land -the forward looking approach of that newspaper, and are

' /particularly impressed by the credentials and the educational

/
,1

principles that were presented by Mr. Kelly in the article.

However, it does seem-unfortunate that the University I
g  Times was allowed to interveiw Mr. Kelly before his appoint-

ment, while our staff members were politely though firmly told

,i~to wait until the new Dean takes over‘ before speaking with him

’ about his plans. . _
There seems to be two possible conclusions that may be

 reached from this action and both seem alarming to us. The

2

first is. that.the University Times did not actually do an «inter-
view with the new Dean. But this seems unlikely since the Times

,- ' is a reliable publication.

The second possibility, and by far the most ‘alarming of the
two, is that for some reason, perhaps an over-sight, the Univer-
sity,jTimes is being given the opportunity to cover important

 campus events that the Pitt News is not allowed to cover.

We sincerely hopethat this was an over-sight. But if it was

 not we think we may legitimately claim the University is making
'  .a strong effort to undermine the efforts of this publication and

/.

. so doing, limit the knowledge and understanding of the Uni-

‘; ,’ veyrsity community in a manner which is reprehensible by any

 g standard. _-

Pitt Gets Bum Rap

by RALPH DEAN

Prestige. Now there’s a commodity that can
come in handy at times.

I was out of town attending a collegiate wrest-
ling match this last weekend with a few of my
friends, who happen to be attending a small eastern
university. I feel into conversation with a young
coed from East Stroudsburg, of all places, who
seemed unbelievably enthralled with me. I could
hear opportunity hammering away at the portals of
my degenerate, chauvanistic mind.

In the course of the evening’s talk I somehow
mentioned the fact that I am a Pitt stident.

“You mean you‘re not from Lehigh?“_She look-
ed stricken.

“No, I go to Pitt. Used to go to Penn State."
“Oh.” She drifted away, and I felt stricken.

Pitt suffers from a case of negative prestige.
Why is this place. which occasionallyl feel so proud
of, lookeddown upon by a large portion of the
pubhc?. .
Although there is no real comparative listing
of the academic quality of this country's universi-
ty‘s I feel relatively sure that Pitt would not fare
badly in an objective comparison. At least, not as
badly as some outsiders would have us believe. Aca-
demic excellence is a relatively small factor in a
prospective students choice of college anyway.
Carnegie-Mellon’s reputation has had to resort to
offbeat credit systems/and the like in an attempt to
draw quality students. The reputation determines
quality in many cases. apparently. not the other
way around.

. So what are the other factors that have sullied

Pitt’s good name? Certainly when Pitt nearly went
broke a few years ago and had to go scurrying for
state aid, it had quite a few outsiders wondering
what was wrong with the tallest university in the
country. But the move to become a state-related
has lowered tuition and thus made Pitt available to
a larger pool of desirable prospects, and has started
the school on a slow climb toward notable quality.
Eliminate the public nature of thelschool as a pos-
sible cu,prit.

To be sure, the location of this campus is no
great help. Then again, Pitt is not alone in that re-
gard. Look at Columbia.

I must place the blame for Pitt’s lack of pres-
tige on its seeming refusal to promote itself. What
is Pitt’s publicity director doing? There is a lot
that man could.do that would help this University’s
reputation, including many projects that would re-
quire no expensive, sustantive change.

He could announce, for instance, that Pitt was
drastically raising its admission standards. No
real change is needed, just an announcement. Or he
could announce that the University is currently ap-
plying for admission to the Ivy League. Just an an-

-nouncemnt, mind you, nothing extreme.

On a more physical level, the University could
require all its professors to wear academic gowns,
as they do at Oxford and similar classy places. Or
they could place a lot of awful Gothic statuary
around campus. It couldn’t hurt.

Finally, the burden of responsibility for raising

. Pitt’s reputation lies with its students. They must
speak proudly of their school to outsiders. Not me, 

though. The next time I meet an attractive girl
from oit of town I’m going to tell her I go to Am-
herst. One can only carry school spirit so far.

  Letters to the Editor

I Women Don’t Fit

Sir: .

I would like to clarify the fol-'

lowing statement’ made by Dean
Medearis when questioned about
my tenure decision in the Pitt
News Feb. 14: “all the facets of
the case were reviewed". If the
tenure committee which met
‘without my knowledge found in-
adequacies in my research, teach-
ing, and service then why was I
not consulted and allowed to pre-
sent information which it might
not have had? This is particular-
ly so because many of my serv-
ice research and teaching activi-
ties are in areas unfamiliar to
the tenure committee.

Another statement made by
Dean Medearis which needs to
be clarified is that my work is
“not relative to the mission of
the University”. If this is so then
why were men in my area of ex-
pertise sought after in the faculty
recruiting in my department?

My experience I believe, high-
lights the very real problems of
the woman in academia: Because
she does not “fit in” and is not
taken seriously, she is totally iso-
lated from those males who make
decisions about her career.
She is not given an opportunity

The Price of Peace

Dear Editor:

During the past weeks, the mass
media have carried numerous ac-
counts of the release of Ameri-
can P.O.W.‘s by the North Viet-
namese. President Nixon prais-
ed these men for halping Ameri-
ca achieve “peace with honor,”
and media reporters, as if to fol-
low suit,’ presented the released
prisoners to the public as return-
ing war heroes. - '

While all of us can rejoice in
the fact that our countrymen fin-
ally have been freed from capti-
vity, we should not allow our

~ enthusiasm to blind us to the
facts. _(I) There is, as yet, no a"

complete peace in Southeast Asia.
In fact, even while radio ‘and
television stations were broad-
casting the prisoners’ release,
United States’ B‘-52’s were drop-
ping tons of bombs on Laos and
Cambodia. (2) The majority of

I've known many handout men

The main trouble with Jack
isn't the money he takes from

he tells his story and gives his

Consequently, while we cele-
brate peace and the return of our
P.O.W.’s, we should, at the same
time, ask ourselves:

Has the price we have paid,
in terms of thelloss of Asian and
American lives and resources,
brought us a complete and dura-
ble peace?

Is it really honorable for us to
allow ourselves and our children
to regard as heroes those persons

by DAVE MAJERNIK

While Pitt students and staff
are in class or at work, many of
‘ their children are busy learning
and playing at the Campus Nur-
sery. ‘

The Campus Nursery and Child
Development Center, located next
to thesUniversity’s_ Falk Elemen-
tary School, has been operating
since ‘September, 1971, and is a li-
censed nursery school. "

The nursery is administered by
the School of Education. Dr. Har-
ry Sartain, head of Falk School, is
in charge.

According to the nursery school
brochure, the center’s two main
functions are:_ "to offer half or
full-time educational facilities for
three and four-year old children
of women who are University stu-
dents, faculty, or staff members“
and “to provide on-campus pro-
fessional learning experiences for
students preparing to work with
young children.”

Nursery admission policies are:
“Within each specified income
range, pupil admissions are de-
termined partially on a first—come.
first-served basis, but the follow-
ing priority order is applicable
also: children of University stu-
dents, children of faculty and
staff, and children who provide
racial and sexual balance within
the center. In the event’ that open-
ings exist after applications made
by University students, faculty,

and staff members have been ex-

hausted, applications will be ac-
cepted frofn the general public.”
I Tuition is from‘ $12 to $22 per
week for a half-day session, de-

pending on the parents’ income, .

and $24 to $44 per week for the

whole day.

In the evening session, tuition is
$3.50 per night. But children of
General Studies students pay only
$1, while the Student Cabinet
pays the remaining $2.50.

According to Gallagher, the an-
nual cost for operating the nur-
sery is $72,000. The University
contri-butes $30,000 and provides

the building rent-free. while the
remainder of the cost is recovered
from tuitions.

Children must be enrolled for
the entire term. Short term en-
rollment is harmful, according to
Dr. Sartain, because a child then
is not accustomed to the people
he is lith. '

In the evening session, children
may be enrolled for just one night
a week, but must come for the en-
tire term.

Presently 4f children are en-
rolled in the day session, although
there are no more than '30 at a
time (which is the present legal
capacity of the nursery). In the
evening session, only four stu-
dents are enrolled.

Plans for the immediate future,
according to Gallagher, do not
include increasing the student
capacity, but rather improving the
present facilities and increasing
the staff.

“Our aim is to have one adult
for every five children." Galla-
gher explained.

lThe evening session was the
brainchild of Barbara Smith, vice
chairman of. the General Studies

Cabinet, who has been working on .

this project since last August.
Smith reported getting the idea

from hearing about a cooperative
babysitting program at a univer-
sity in New York.

But, she explained. Pennsyl-
vania has such stringent regula-
tions about the health and safety
of child care facilities that a stu-
dent-operated babysitting pro-

tunities for cognitive develop-'

ment, stimulate their minds, and

teach them how to cope with so-

cial situations. She also reported‘
that although _the children may
choose their activities, each ac‘-
tivity is structured and under
adult guidance.

The -children are free toroom

.-remodeled private home which

houses the nursery. There is also
a woodshop where children can
go, three at a time under adult
supervision, and learn to mani-
pulate saws, hammers, pliers,
and drills. Cots, a piano, a televi-

’ sion set, and climbing bars com-_

plete the interior equipment.

Facilities in the back yard in-
clude a sandbox, swings, climbing
bars, wagons, and tricycles.

Once a term thechildren go on
a field trip. Past tripshave been
to a farm, the Carnegie Museum, '
and the Aviary. Frequently the
children‘ are taken’ on walks
around the neighborhood.

.A hot lunch is served at noon
and a snack in the morning and af-
ternoon. No food is served during
the evening session for economic
reasons, but children are" free to
bring their own food.

Parents are advised toidress
their children in old, comfortable
clothes so the children will not
have to keep their clothes clean
while participating in the activ-
ities. ,

The full-time staff consists of
two teachers, two teacher’s aides,
and an administrativ assistant.
In addition, thereare two work-
study students who each work 13
hours per week, six independent

_ study students who each work

four to eight hours a week, five

volunteers from the YMCA who

' work irregular hours, and three

Neighborhood Youth Corps stu-
dents who work in the afternoons.

The nursery follows the Uni-
versity calendar and operates for
approximately 46 weeks during
the year.

Activities in the evening session
are the same as‘ duringithe day,
except less rigorous because
many_children are tired and less
active at this time of the day.
Some children just rest or watch
television, while. primary chil-
dren may be tutored in home-
work assignments.

PClh.‘Symphony Stars,  
Concertit Fail to Shine

by ANDREW J. SOPKO
Arts Editor

Over the centuries, the concer-
to has evolved in a number of
ways. And it was this evolution

‘-which was satiatingly impressed

upon Pittsburgh Symphony audi-
ences this past weekend. In a pro-
gram stuffed with various exam-
ples of the form, various “stars
of the symphony” (or so they
were billed) fulfilled the tasks"of
soloists in the compositions per-
formed.’ ‘

Opening with the Haydn “Sym—
phonie Concertante,” ‘opus 84,
Murray Feldman, violin; Michael
Grebanier, cello; Elden Gatwood,
oboe; and Arthur Kubey, bassoon,
attempted, despite their lack of
ensemble, to provide a decent
rendering of the work. And while
a’ delicate performance was su-
pervised by conductor Donald Jo-
hanos, who replaced Dr. Stein-

berg on Saturday evening, the soli ’

were more of a hindrance than a
help to his interpretation.

On very rare occasions, the
quartet -blended, but it was far
more common for one of the in-
strumentalist to drown out his
compatriots. Their sense of en-

— semble was‘ repeatedly ruined by

a violin soloist who continually in-
sisted on having the limelight.

Following the maladies of the
Haydn, we were gently eased into
the 20th century via the work of
the little known‘American com-
poser Charles Griffes. His “Poem
for Flute and Orchestra,” an
Americanized “Prelude to the Af-
ternoon of a Faun,” passed the
solo spot to principal flautist
Bernard Goldberg. _Despite Gold-
berg’s warm, articulate reading,
the composition can be summed

with the “Concerto for Bassoon
and Orchestra” by orchestra
memoer Stephen Paulson, who
also occupied the solo seat for the
work. Composed in 1967, the work
is a potpourri of tonality, atonal-
ity, serialism, and pointilism. and
we dare any listener to tell just
when any one of these techniques

‘begins or ends throughout the

work.

Many of the sounds produced by ‘

the bassoon in this work were so

harlequin that one could barely-

help from chuckling. And by such
an attitude, we hardly mean to be-

Paulson is a fine musician, but his
qualities as a composer may be
summed up in less than glowing

terms. Good bassoon concerti
were always at a premium, and_
one must feel-that they are'still
at a premium, especially after
hearing this attempt. While com-
positional knowledge was present,

Wien's Musical Confrasfs Examined

by ANDREW J. SOPKO
Arts Editor
“Bend but don’t break,” has al-
ways been a popular slogan among
the Viennese, who feel that it ade-
quately sums up their rather re-‘

laxed and care-free attitude to-'

wards life in general. And" if there
ever were a time when this slogan
could be considered a summation
of the city’s hedonistically orient-
ed outlook, it certainly must refer
to Vienna at the turn-of-the-cen-
tury. Dumplings, sachertorte, and
Strauss waltzes neatly sum up the
outlook of this very conservative
and pleasure-seeking metropolis.

In the midst of this somewhat
"fairytale” existence, however,
was a group of pioneers who had
little in common with the glitter
and glamor surrounding them. The
genius of Berg, Schoenberg, and
Webern was changing attitudes in
music, slowly but surely. “Break
and don’t bend” might very easily
have served as their slogan. In-
tent _upon breaking the primary
rules of tonality, thisgroup, des-
pite pressure from the Viennese
press and public, had no intentions
of bending to the whims of Haps-
burg conservatism.

This m/usical clash between the
old tonality and the new atonality
was ably demonstrated recently
at the’ Frick Auditorium in a Mu-
sic Department concert devoted
to “Music in Vienna at the Time
of Freud.” In effect, the underly-
ing success of the this program

Film Review

ilaneand

Once in while on late night TV, a
movie of recent vintage will crop
up. The viewer will squint twice at
the credits, trying to remember if
he had ever heard anything about
the film._ Eventually he will dis-
cover what a forgettable flick he
has seen, with commercials and
TV editing taking their toll.

Well, in a year or two, insomni-
acs will discover Steelyard Blues
(currently at the Kings Court),
and switch channels after the first
two commercials. "It’s not that
Steelyard is such a bad flick, but
thereduction to a small screen
will kill it,iwith much of its humor
surgically removed.

The plot is rather hazy, but in-
consequential and loosely con-
cerns a group of strange persons
trying to rehabilitate an old Navy
plane.

Donald Sutherland (Klute,

quent jail inhabitant and demoli-
tion derby driver _Jesse Veldini,

spring from its musical con-
trasts: the old Vienna was repre-

sented by composers such as’

Mahler and Kriesler while the

new musical outlook was express- "

ed through compositions of Berg,
Schoenberg, and Webern. A more
striking musical dichotomy than
this there probably never was.

The more “tonal” portion of
the program consisted of two
Ruckert songs of Mahler and the
Rachmaninoff piano arrange-
ment of Kriesler’s “Liebesfreud.”
Mary Ann Doody was the soprano
in the Mahler with Dr. Marvin
Tartak fulfilling the role of ac-
companist. In relation to the re-
mainder of the program, the two
songs came off rather tepidly,
leaving many of us in a somewhat
ambivalent state concerning the
composer’s intentions. “Liebes-
freud”. found Dr. Tartak perform-
ing at the keyboard mir schlag, de-
lightfully conveying the whirlwind
world of the Viennese cafe and
kondetorei.

Both artists also collaborated in
four early songs (opus 2) of Alban
Berg, each of which demanded
the greatest amount of concentra-
tion and power from both vocalist
and accompanist. In the final
song, the firstvever written with-
out a key signature, the world of
tonsality is compeletely discarded
as the vocalist prophetically sings
“One dies,” (tonality, perhaps?)
“while another lives.” .

Anton Webern’s compositional

conciseness (his entire output
easily fits on four long playing
discs) was represented on the
program by his “Four Pieces for
Violin and Piano.” Violinist Eliot
Chapo joined Tartak in an exact-
ingly precise rendition of musical
leanness. Even‘ after more than
60 years, Webern’s
falls uneasily upon most ears.

Closing out the program was
the first Pittsburgh prformance
of Arnold Schoenberg’s “Second
String Quartet” as performed by
the Carnegie-Mellon Quartet as-
sisted by Mary Ann Doody. While
the string ensemble proved itself
more than able throughout the in-
tricacies of the work, it was the
soprano soloist who conveyed the
message of Schoenberg’s break
with tradition most convincingly.

Singing like some atonal angel, ‘ A

Ms. Doody carried many of us off
to unknown worlds with her vocal
gymnastics. Multi-octaved leaps,

untroubled changes from what
seemed absolute fortissimo to pi-
anissimo in an instant, and the

sheer power of her overall deliv-

ery proved overwhelming. It was,

quite frankly, a tremendous suc-‘
cess for her as a vocalist. And in

the regard of music making, not

only her performance, but the per-

formance of everyone in this very

often demanding and difficult pro-

gram shone with unqualified suc-

cess.

Don Hook -Up 0 Again

Frank (Howard Hesseman).

Frank also makes life difficult
for Veldini’s' girl, high class hook- ,
er Iris Caine (Oscar winner Jane
Fonda). Much of the movie con-
cerns the two lovers and the low
deal they get from cruel society,
personaified in the status-grub-
bing, power-hungry Frank Veldini.

This concern with “harsh real-
ity” does flaw the film. It is not
honed finely enough for satire,
and is not fluffy enough to be

merely “pure fun.” But it is fun- I

ny.

, One character who is'not' caught
up in life’s conflicts, and'in fact
seems to have never heard of
reality, is “Eagle,” played by Pe- ‘
ter Boyle in a turnabout from Joe
and The Candidate. Eagle is an es-
capee from a mental institution, a
former circus fly, a multi-faceted
impressionist and the film’s big-
gest laugh getter.

One movie mishandling reality
is The~Life and Times of Judge
Roy Bean, now at the Warner. The
ads read, “If this story ain’t true
—it shoulda been.” The film cer-
tainly needed something; maybe
an adherence to reality would

Republicans Offer New

No Fault Insurance Bill

by BOB WARNER _
Associated Prss Writer

HARRISBURG (AP)~House Republicans came out Friday with
another no-fault automobile insurance plan, warning consumers not,to_

expect substantial rate cuts.

"No-fault insurance will not guarantee a bonanza in insurance pre-
mium reductions.” said Rep. Percy Foor. R-Bedford. chairman of the
House Consumer Protection Committee. -

“But we do need no-fault insurance if for no other reason than to
create a better delivery system . . . so a man gets paid and paid prompt-

_ ly when_he is injured in an accident}?

Foor’s bill, to be introduced next week. would require all divers to
buy bodily injury coverage for the‘mse‘lves ‘and liability against dam-

ages they may cause.

_ Accident victims would receive up to‘$10,000 from their own insur-

ance companies for lost wages and medical expenses. regardless of

Paul Newman gets in his share
of overacting as the hanging judge
of the title.

Screenwriter John Milius (Jere-

miah Johnson) reportedly receiv- .

ed $300,000 for his efforts. If this
film is an indication of his work,
he probably spent the money on
comic books.

But the movie is not without one
saving grace. The performance of
Bruno, as Watch Bear, is worth
the price of admission. If you
haven’t the money, then just watch
the Saturday morning cartoons.

Loggins, Messina

Set for Mosque

I by BARB GERAUD

One of the most popular groups.

on the rock scene today is coming
to Pittsburgh.

Kenny Loggins had some mod-
erate fame as the writer‘ of
“House at Pooh Corner” for the
Nitty Gritty Dirt-Band. Jim Mess-
ina was bassist and producer for
the Buffalo Springfieldand Poco.
Together, they have become what
Columbia (thier record company)
delightedly calls “The L&M Mo-
ment.” '

Loggins and Messina may not
be everyone’s answer to a ciggie,
but they- do play some awful pretty
music. They. played at Pitt last
spring and caused such a stir that
Pat DiCesare has booked them for
a return engagement_ at ‘the
Mosque on March 13.

The duo first got together when
when Jim was to produce Kenny’s'
solo album for Columbia. “But,”

as Jimmy puts it, “when we start-'
ed to work out tunes, we discov- E

ered that it might be agood idea
‘to do an album together.” ‘

They make happy’, music, and -

have been called .“one of the best
"couplings oftalent since the hey-
day of Lennon-McCartney.” I

It was another lazy-type night
at the Field House on Saturday as
the Panther cagers easily han-
dled the Colgate Red Raiders.
overwhelming them with a 76-
63 victory. '

In a slow tempoed contest rem-
iniscent of their previous game
lith North Carolina A&T. the
Cats came one step closer to
reaching the .500 mark—they are
now 11-12 on the season.

.Colgate’s head basketball coach
Bill Vesp feels that Pitt's overall
record is not really indicative of
its playing ability. .

“They (Pitt) didn’t blow us out

and there is some consolation in
that,” stated Vesp. “But like ours __

their record is deceiving. I know
what it’s like. Sometimes it’s just
hard to get things rolling.”

 

The Panthers found things a lit-
tle hard to get rolling in the be-
ginningof the contest with the
Raiders.

Colgate kept the Pitt shooters
under control during the first five
minutes of action and steadily
built up a lead.

With 14:39 left in the first half
the Red Raiders accumulated a
five point lead (they led by the
score of 9-4) on a layup. by 6-7
sophomore center Jamie Russell.

The Pantherscweren’t down for
long. Within. the next four min-
utes the Cats went from a five
point deficit to five point lead.

The cagers continued to pour on
the points until they were far in
the lead at‘ the halftime with a 13
point lead, the score being 36-
23 (in the last 14 minutes of the
first half the Panthers scored 20-
32 points that they attempted).

  Market 
 1 Place   

Lately, a lot of Pitt coaches have been walking around with

.long faces because they have received word from Athletic Di-

rector Casmir Myslinski that they will probably have less mon-

ey to work with next year.

The only coaches who won’t'receive the monotarial cuts are

_ Buzz-Ridl (basketball) and ‘John Majors (football). Actually,
the football program has received a handsome increase this

year, as part of Pitt’s renwed effort to regain gridiron promi-
nence. And, because money doesn’t grow on top of Cardiac Hill,
the minor sports will have to make the sacrifice. '

Well, nojmatter which point of view youtake, the situation

is a sticky one.

One the one side, you have to understand that every coach
of each minor sport is dedicated to that sport. If Jim Banner
and Dave Adams didn’t have trackand wrestling as their‘ pri-
mary concerns, then they shouldn’t hold the jobs they‘do. It’s
only natural. So, when a money cut is announced, you can’t ex-

pect these men to be all smiles.

Conversely, however, you have the football side of the
story. It is old news that football is the number one program at

The onslaught persisted in the
second half as the Panthers out-
stripped the Colgate squad by 15

_ points at one point early in the

half.

The Raiders, however, still

found the energy to chip away at.

minutes left in the contest. they
shaved the lead down to only sev-
en points.

At this point Bill Knight started
the Pitt momentum up again.
scoring from 22 feet out. Along
with Knight, Mickey Martin,
Keith Starr, and Jim Bolla hit to
finally pull it out for the Panthers.

“We seemed like little flies

compared to Pitt,” commented’

Vesp. “We’re not a zone playing
team, but we had to play it

it tonight.’ Ordinarily we like to
play the man to man. If anybody
could _have toldme tonight how to

match Pitt man to man, I would

have done it.”

Pitt/’s head coach Buzz Ridl
also assessed his Colgate oppon-
ents. According to Ridl, “I didn't
think they (the Raiders) were that
aggressive. They were extreme-
ly patient and not once did they
take a needless, shot.”

Saturday night’s contest against
Colgate was-also Parents’ Night
and many of the Panthers were

-able to play in front of their par-

ents.

. Knight certainly pleased his
mother as he was once again the

‘high scorer of the game with 31

points. He also led in the rebound-
ing department with 16.

Monday, February 19, l973—THE PITT l\lEWS—Page 9 t  7'7‘

iCalt Cagersi Clout Colgate, 76-63

BILL “MOONEY” KNIGHT put on an outstanding show for his mother on
Saturday night which was gparents’ Night at the Field-House. Mrs." Knight,’
viewing her first game at Pitt, saw her son collect a game high of 31 points.

The Colgate mentor had a little Pitt F6 F1 Reb. ‘fats’,

 

Pitt. (Don’t laugh, please.) As far as Myslinski is concerned, he
has to make the football program go. And while football uses up
the most money, it also makes the most—in fact it makes the
money by which the other sports survive, aside from basket-
ball, which has shown to be a potential money-maker.

Let’s forget for a moment that the perspiration of the min-
orsport athletes is every bit as genuine as that ofthe football
and basketball players, that they too practice daily and repre-
sent the school when they compete, and let’s put the cards on
the table. '

By applying a sound business theory, it would be safe to say
that there is more of a market in Pittsburgh for collegiate foot-
ball than there is for swimming, track, wrestling, golf, and ten-
nis. It’s not that people don’t respond to these sports, but that
the talent has to be superior to draw the crowd. People are en-
ticed to' go see a Kip ‘Keno/Jim Ryan mile but might be more
reluctant to go see Joe Hardworker run against Jim Improved.

But again, a track program can’t recruit thetopnotchi ath-
letes without money and Pitt hasn’t made any money since
1953-64.

How’s that for a nice circle.
“We intend to go out and solicit funds,” Myslinski said, in
announcing an upcoming campaign. “If we can get enough mon-

ey we will cover all sports, if not, we will have to redistribute
our funds.

_ "Our only purpose is to build a program to the point where
It can bring in enough money for a better overall total program.

_ We don’t want to cut sports, in fact I’d like to add hockey, but it

will all depend on how much moneywe have.”

The cuts, which according to Myslinski have yet to be de-
termined, will not be budget cuts. but will be in scholarships
(which is probably worse). One Pitt coach had this to say: "I
hope Myslinski tells the papers about it so they will know why
we get our brains beat out next year.” " i '

That’s probably ture, but Myslinski believes that tem-

porary inconvenience can bring about permanent improvement.

h Blue Chip ‘Campaign

New Pitt football coach Johnny Majors kicked
off the announcement of his 1973 recruiting cam-
paign and he did it in rather spectacular fashion.

Majors announced that Pitt has landed three,

top Western Pennsylvania High School athletes, in-
cluding possibly the most sought—after back in the
country. Signing letters-of—intent to attend Pitt this
fall were: Tony Dorsett, the unanimous high school

amowski, a 6-4, 190 pound end, also from Hopewell
High School; and Joe Macerelli, a 6-3, 220 pound
linebacker and tight end from Canon-McMillan
School.

“I think this is indicative of the confidence
some of the fine athletes in this area have in our
new program,“ a happy Majors said in making the
announcement. “This is one of the finest things
that could happen to our program. I can assure area
high school players that there ‘will be other fine
athletes as teammates with them at Pitt.”

Dorsett is the biggest “name” running back to

come out of Western Pennsylvania in years. The
5-11, 180-pound speedster (4.5 in the 40) was named
first-team Parade All-American, Coach and Ath-
letic All-American and Scholastic Magazine All-
American. He was the top vote getter among all the
running backs in the country on the Parade All-

. American team.

In leading Hopewell to a 17-2 record and the
MAC Conference championship the last two years;

Dorsettrrushed for 1,034 yards and -9 touchdowns

In addition to his All-American honors, Dor-

State, All-WPIAL as a junior and senior, second

Going into the Easterns, the
Panthers have at least four con-

George Bryant, John Buzzato,
John Chatman, last year’s East-

Craig Tritch. Whatever else the
Panthers _do to dent the perennial

The Pitt gymnastic team lost to Syra-
cuse on Saturday 148.95 - 96.60 in a dis-
appointing meet.

In floor exercises Dick Pribis took
third with a 8.0. Ed Swerdlow did not make
the trip. Lee Lilly placed second in the
pommel horse with a 8.35. Pribis placed
fourth in vaulting with a 8.25. Dan Camp-
bell returned to competition in the paral-
lel bars this weekend taking a second
witha7.4. A

“Dan did well, after not working
out consistently in four weeks,” comment-

ed Assistant Coach Ig Perez.

Top ring man John Hornick didn’t
make the trip to Syracuse leaving Gary
Wolfe and Cliff Custer to compete.

iCuster competed with a shoulder in-

Jury.

“No one on the team looked steady.
There were weak performances by all
athletes,” commented Perez.

“We were disappointed over the small
breaks,” said Perez referring to Bob
Rodgers who fell on the side horse and
Elliot Sanft who missed parts on his
routine.

Next weekend the gymnasts will travel
to Penn State. Pitt hopes to field a full
team. Penn State has had an excellent
season and is expected to win the Na-
tionals. Penn State lost a tough meet
against Southern Connecticut State 165.-
60 - 165.30 this weekend. '

After the Penn State meet the gym-
nasts will travel to Army. Closing out the
season with the Eastern’s, Pribis, Chris
Gardner, Rodgers, and Lilly will com-
pete.

Cold Water Hurts

by RON SIEGEL
Pitt‘s swimming team hit a cold spell in
cold water Saturday in Syracuse. and
were defeated by the Orangemen, 71-38.

"All of our swimmers tighened up
when they hit the water,” commented
head coach Dick Bradshaw. “I’m not
using it as an excuse,’ but this was the
first meet in which we didn’t break any
school records. Actually, there was some
question as to whether we should have
been swimming in water that cold.

"This was the first time in four meets
that we haven’t performed well,” added
Bradshaw. “Things finally caught up with

us. Syracuse won the Big Four meet’

last year, and they performed really well
Saturday.” -

Pitt won only ‘two events, and had
expected to do well in the medley relay,
but was upset by the Orangemen in that

event. Mark Wallace won the
200-yard backstroke, and Jack Garo _copped

the three-meter diving event.  ,. 

“The medley relay came early in the
meet. and when‘ we lost it, we knew that

we didn’t have‘ much of a chance to . :3;

win the meet,” said Bradshaw.
The tankers return to action this

Saturday when they play host to Young- 4.;
stown State and Carnegie Mellon in a 
double dual meet. What happens in this‘ 

type of meet is that each‘ team's swim-

mers perform, and then the results are 

compared for each pair of schools. so
that a team can win.‘ lose or split two
meets.

ning 5-4 record by copping the double

 Game Stats Mellon Squashes Icers

 

In West Penn Tourney  

by BART MACK

Luckily for the Pitt Hockey Club. last night's
game with Carhegie—Mellon was only exhibition and
did not count in the league standings. C-MU handed
Pitt a 3-1 loss at the Civic Arena and in doing so,
established themselves as -the number one tern in
the Western Pa. Intercollegiate Hockey Association.

The game had been billed as the speed of Car-
negie-Mellon versus the size of Pitt but the Tartans
showed more than just speed. Carnegie-Mellon
stood up to Pitt’s physical attack and played solid
positional hockey. Meanwhile, the Pitt skaters were
floundering all over the ice in a frenzy to control
the puck.

’ ' With both teams shorthanded, Mike Powers

took advantage of a lapse in the Pitt defense to put

Carnegie-Mellon out in front. Powers stood in front

of the Pitt net with all the time in the world to shoot

and only goaltender Mark-Lieberman to stop him.

From about 10 feet out, Powers let a wrist shot go

and Lieberman watched the puck fly between his

legs. .

' Don Galloway tallied the ’winning goal with 5:11
left to play in the first period. Once again, the Pitt
defense was to blame. Gallaway took a pass from
Bob Eastman at the Pitt blue line, cut around the

« defense and went in on Lieberman’s right side. Gall-
away duked Lieberman to the left and stuck the puck
in on the short side.

Gallaway’s goalcame with thelTartans short-
handed. C‘-MU outshot Pitt in thefirstperiod, 11-5.

Billy Glanvillei brought Pitt to within one goal A

at the 8:10 mark of the second stanza. Glanville

banged in a loose puck amidst a wild scrable in front

of Tartan goalie Jeff Hart. Pitt held the edge
throughout most of the period, outshooting C-MU by
a 12-5 margin. Hart turned- away anything" and ev-

erything Pitt could throw at him, proving that he is g‘

indeed the league’s best netminder. A

I Mike Kenworthy, Carnegie-Mellon’s highly tout-
ed scorer, wrapped it all up'with‘5:03 gone in the
last jrame. The Pitt skaters finally succumbed to
their own frustrations only 10 seconds later and
the fireworks began.

Pitt defenseman Duke Schaeffer was caught
crosschecking Kenworthy in the Pitt end and de-
cided that he would not go to penalty box alone.
Schaeffer squared off with Kenworthy and dropped
him to the ice, landing successive punches to his op-
ponents face.

APARTMENTS AND

 

While the referee was busy in the Pitt end, Gary
Cummings dropped his gloves and went at it with
Carnegie-Mellon’s Mike Howser deep in the Tar-
tan’s end. Cummings and Howser tangled to the
left of the C-MU net and Hart jumped into the melee.
Seeing thatithe sides were not even,.Joe Testa rush-
ed into the Tartan end to join in the fisticuffs.

V When the ice was cleared, it was Testa who re-
ceived the game misconduct for being the third man
into the fight instead of Hart. In fact, Hart was not
assessed a two mintute minor leaving his crease
and only received a five minute major. Pitt came
out of it all shorthanded for the following two min-
utes.

Pitt poured the pressure on but couldnot find
the solution to best Hart, Phil Clarke broke in alone
on Hartbut the steady netminder turned his shot
away and then robbed Denny Browne on the re-
bound. .

Pitt wound up with a 26-19 edge in shots on goal
even though they played almost half of the final
frame down a man. The two teams will face each
other in a City Division contest on March 4 at the
Alpine Ic_e Chalet.

Cracked Ice: Dave Bahnson has played his last
game for Pitt. Bahnson will be leaving for Vermont
sometime this week and will miss the remainder of
the season. Joe Testa will become the second line-
center but theloss of Bahnson will weaken the team

considerably. ’ -\
