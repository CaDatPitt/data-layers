that the affair was a success. Six-
hundred couples attended. Balk
said that the proﬁt on the dance
was no more than $25 or $30.

“Brag Sheet” Announced

President Ross Reese opened
the meeting to a small group of
SC members which increased
slowly as the meeting got well un-
der way. Ac-cording to Reese, the
Academic Promotions Committee
is working on student rating
sheets for teachers which will be
effected next semester along with
a “Brag Sheet.” The “Brag Sheet”
is to promote school spirit by re-
vealing the contributions of this
university to the community—-
thus the name “Brag Sheet.”

RUTH HEIMBUECHER

Freshmen entering Pitt in‘September, 1955 will be “guinea
pigs”, for the recently-approved core-curriculum plan. of
study, an experimental program designed to give the student

a broader general education.

A result of an extensive eight-month study by the Col-
l.ege Self-Study Committee, a group of elected faculty mem-
bers, the program will consist of four “cores”: communica-
tion skills, introduction to the humanities, social sciences,

and physical sciences (or biologi-4
cal sciences).

Every student entering the Col-
lege would be required to take
these four courses, once they have
been planned and tested. They
would provide one-half of the
student’s credits earned during
his freshman and sophomore years
at Pitt, in addition to partially
satisfying the requirements (still
in effect) of the three distribution
ﬁelds—humanities, social sciences
and natural sciences.

In the ﬁeld of communications,
the student would take a course
to develop his skill in writing,
speaking, reading and listening.

An integrated study of the na-
ture and achievement of man will
be included in
the humanities
“core”, as well
as m aterial

f r o m history,
literature, phi-
losophy, relig-
ion, music and
the ﬁne arts.

No Buildings On CampuslSod

At a special meeting Dec.
28, trustees of the University
announced that no buildings
will beterected on the campus
of the Cathedral of Learning
during the next 25 years.

University authorities expressed
satisfaction that the gift of the
three-acre. tract of land fronting
on the north side of Fifth Ave.
between Ruskin and Tennyson
Ave. will permit expansion with-
out detracting from the campus.

This decisionof the trustees will
later be incorporated into an
agreement with the A. W. Mellon
Educational and Charitable Trust
to provide a permanent record of
policy.

If conditions warrant it, build-
ing may be undertaken before 1978
with the mutual agreement of the
trustees and the board of the Mel-
lon Institute of Industrial Re-
search.

Referring to the land grant,

said, “This gift has enabled us to
agree on some policy for our fu-
ture campus development and
makes it possible for us to take a
long stride forward to our goal of
developing a truly great campus
university, in a great urban en-
vironment.” I . '

the plan when they decided the
recently acquired tract of land
on Fifth, Ruskin and Tennyson
would provide for expansion
without detracting from the‘
campus.

an integrated study of selected
topics and problems from physics-,
chemistry, geology and astrono-
my. The Biological Sciences would
cover the signiﬁcant topics and
problems of botany, zoology, bac-
teriology and psychology.

Broaden Scope of Knowledge

Purpose of the new program, as
stated by Dr. Putnam F. Jones,
chairman of the faculty commit-
tee, is to broaden the sqope and
increase the diversiﬁed knowledge
of the student outside his major
ﬁeld. And it will enable him to
communicate with other people in
other vocations. _

“As it is,” said Dr. Jones,
“chemists can talk to chemists,
journalists to journalists, but there
is no common ground. This is bad
for democracy,” he said, “and bad
for the world. Education should
be a preparation for living.”

No Radical Faculty Changes

In spite of the radical changes
his new program would mean in
classes now offered freshmen and
sophomores, Dr. Jones stressed
that there would be no wholesale
faculty revision.

“We do not want to displace any
single individual on the campus,”
“said Dr. Jones. “Our faculty is
perfectly capable of handling this
program as wellas anybody else."

During the next two years, ﬁnal
plans and methods for the new
core—curriculum will be polished
and completed for their “test-run"
in September of 1955.

Intensive Study Needed

This will be accomplished by
writing to other schools in which
such a program is already in ef-
fect, and ﬁnding out how the plan
works.

. In schools in which the courses
look most promising, a more ex-
tensive personal study would be
undertaken, through watching the
courses in operation, talking with
the school’s students and faculty,
and estimating its general effect-
iveness. The best teaching prac-

at Pitt.

' Run Test Classes

The four basic courses would
then be tested in certain “pilot”
classes, and ﬁnally adopted it
proceeding satisfactorily.

“Under the system now in op-
eration,” said Dr. Jones, “we have

‘ a psychic picture of a ‘little man’

inside each student, hands folded,
merely receptive to the lecture
material. The new core—curricu-
lum courses are designed to make
that ‘little man’ lean forward and
take anactive part in the learning
process.”

_No provision has yet been made
for the night school student work-
ing for a degree.

U. .9. Citizen Always Best Possible

Customer

By ANNA MAY BARTIROME

“The best possible customer
is the United States citizen,”
says Pier George Brovelli, a
graduate student in the School
of Retail Training. George,
who prefers to be called by his
second name, is a native of Milan,
Italy and at present is studying
the principles of American Retail
in the University.

Returns to Milan in April

George is planning __to stay in
the United States until April,
when he will return to Milan to
begin his retailing career. He has
been in this country since the be-
ginning of Septemlfer.

After his return, he will work
for his father, who is the manag-
ing director of a chain of 78 de-
partment stores, located through-
out Italy.

. Degree to Come

George is a graduate of Bocconi
University of Italy. Since be sub-
mitted his doctor’s thesis before

-he came to the U. S., the degree

will be conferred upon him after

his return to Milan.

By working Mondays and Sat-
urdays in Horne’s Department
Store, George had the opportunity
to meet and observe the American
shopers. “Stores and people in the
U. S. are absolutely different from
those in Europe,” "George said.
“Shoppers in European countries
are not as enthusiastic and inter-
ested in new styles as Americans
are’),

Low Pressure Preferred

People in Europe do not like
high pressure salesmanship nor

- do they resp-ond to advertisements.

As a result of this public atti-

tude, advertising is conﬁned to

window display only. George
said that there are no newspaper
ads, radio commercials, or mail
circulars. He prefers the Ameri-
can business system and the
American customer.

The most outstanding difference
that George observed is the dif-
ference between the purchasing

Pitt To Host

Group In April

Political leaders, students, and
educators will meet at Pitt this
April for the Citizenship Clearing
House of Western Pennsylvania.

Dr. William C. Seyler, assistant
professor of 5 political science,
states that the purpose of the
meeting is to arouse student inter-
est in politics and to help them
take an active part.

Through the clearing house stu-
dents in political science, along
with recently graduated students,
are introduced to the various po-
litical parties. Records are kept to

, determine if the student maintains

this interest after leaving school.

Blockstein Talk
Set for Today

William L. Blockstein, adminis-
trative assistant to the dean of
the School of Pharmacy at Pitt,
will speak today before the Pitts-
burgh Branch of the American
Pharmaceutical Association.

He will address branch mem-
bers at the regularly scheduled
meeting of the association in the
main auditorium of the Mellon In-
stitute at 8:30 p.m. His topic will
be “How You Can Improve Your
Public Relations.”

Mr. Blockstein has done re-
Search on public relations for own-
ers of retail pharmacies and will
present some of his ﬁndings to
pharmacists at this meeting.

U. S. Stores Use Credit
Almost all purchases in Euro-

with cash, whereas U.S. depart-

George prefers the calm of Oak-
land to the confusion of down-
town. “In Oakland there’s a feel-
ing of Old Greece in Mellon In-
stitute, a touch of German in the
University Gothic architecture,
and pure Modern America in the

sor of French at Yale, and Miss
Dorothy F. Leet, President of Reid
Hall, begins on July 5 and will
end on August 14.

Students accepted will leave
New York in mid-June and be
conducted on a tour of various
French cities before beginning
their studies in Paris. At the com-
pletion of the course, students
will be given three weeks to travel
on their own before returning to
this country.

For further information and ap-

‘Cinderella’ Smash
Hit at Playhouse

“A Kiss for Cinderella,” the new
smash hit at the Pittsburgh Play-
house, is proving to be the biggest
success at the Community Theater
since “Peg 0’ My Heart." Lucy
Seibert plays the title role of a lit-
tle British maid who believes she
is Cinderella.

Her hopes are culminated in a
dream of going to a “Ball.” Wil-
liam Ross, who plays an English
bobby, shares top honors with
Miss Seibert. “A Kiss for Cinder-
ella” is looking forward to a suc-

cessful run from now to Jan. 23.

Says Italian Student

to an American metropolis, said

George. Only‘Milan resembles the
modern American city.
Stores Are High

The only thing‘ that George
couldn’t become used to was the
height of the department stores.
An average Italian department

stores is only six stories high, ac-
cording to George. He said that
European business establishments
concentrate on horizon-tal distribu-
tion and not height.

No Food in Europe’s Stores

Restaurants are rarely found in
Europe an department stores.
Where found, they are small and
poorly equipped. According to
George, the stores in Europe cater
to the working class, unlike the
U.S. stores which have a large
variation of prices, materials, and

' departments.

Housefurnishings are more pop-
ular than clothes to the average
European buyer, said George.

Though George is enjoying his
studies in the United States, he
is anxious to return to Milan to
begin his career.

Pi Tau Phi, College honorary, has announced, its tappees
for this semester, 14 women and 18 men.
One of the oldest honoraries on campus, Pi Tau Phi‘
was begun Mar. 14, 1925, at a dinner at Oak Manor in

A

Pittsburgh.

The organization was conceived
by the local chapter of the Amer-
ican Association of University
Professors and the Association of
Honor Graduates. These groups
feltthe need for a comprehensive
h o n 0 r a r y organization, which
would include students in all the
schools of the University.

During the ’30’s, rules of the so-
ciety were changed to include
juniors and seniors in only the
College and the School of Educa-
tion, who have in their ﬁrst two
years maintained a QPA of 2.50
or“ above, based upon at least- 60
credits. '

Ideal of the group, according
to president Samuel Seigle, is
“to unite in fellowship those
who have excelled in scholarship
and who will stimulate one an-
other to continue in such an ef-
fort.”

Initiation for this year’s tappees
will be held in the faculty lounge
at 5:30 p.m. today. Initiation din-
her will follow.

Dr. William C. Pannetta, in-

C/lnthropologist Doubles as Socio logist

By JOHN CALDWELL
Digging ancient civilizations is one of the jobs of Wil-
liam E. Edwards, assistant professor of sociology at Pitt—-and

it’s the pick and shovel type,

not the hepcat type.

For many years some anthropologists thought that one
very ancient population existed in Florida. Edwards proved

the existence of this civilization,‘

and possibly others.

Edwards, and the ﬁndings of
projects. directed by him, showed
that perhaps several different
groups of people existed.

Conducts Eight Seasons

Eight seasons of anthropologi-
cal ﬁeld‘ research have been con-
ducted by Edwards both here in
the States and abroad.

He has carried on research in?

Switzerland and France. Most of
Edwards’ work has been done for
the State of Florida, the Univer-
sity of Georgia, and Johns Hop-
kins University.
Joined Pitt Faculty in Fall

His teaching career in anthro-
pology began last year at Hunter
College in New York. He joined
the faculty at Pitt in September
of 1953. While busily engaged in
teaching, he also worked on his

Ph.D. degree, ﬁnishing the re-

quirements last year.

Clinging to the theory of very
ancient populations of Florida, he
and his associates spent four sea-
sons‘ in the sunshine state. His

work has been concerned with"

studying the earliest humans in
that area. '

Through the efforts of his proj-
ects, he demonstrated that over
a period of thousands of years,
when man was so primitive that
he lacked even such things as
pottery or agriculture, different
groups of people existed in the
state. .

Old Animals Present

Results of the concentrated re-
search and excavations show that
these people apparently lived at
the time of extinct animals such
‘as mammoths, camels, giant ar-
madillos, sabre-toothed tigers, etc.
One if not more of these camp-
sites, in addition to being the only
one east of the Great Plains, show-
ing that man was contemporane-
ous with these extinct, animals,
is also the only site yet reported
to have material from later cul-
tures deposited above refuse of
Early Hunters, and the only one
datable by geology.

The geological dating has shown
that several of these populations
must have lived in Florida more
than 6500 years ago.

Plans Book Soon

Because of the importance of
this work, Edwards plans to com-
plete necessary studies as soon as
possible and hopes to have a book
on the ﬁnal results ready for pub-
lication in the near future.

Among other work in Europe in
1948, Edwards excavated a Neo-
lithic site of Swiss lake-dwellers
who farmed and raised domesti-
cated animals some 5000 years
ago.

He spent most of 195.2 in north-
ern Georgia directing excavations
of a Cherokee Indian town. In
the huge council house there, the

Alas! could this be Yorick?

Cherokees decided in the early
1700’s to side with the Europeans
instead of helping the Creek In-
dians. Otherwise the Creeks
would likely have been successful
in wiping out the English settle-
ments in the Carolinas. Excava-
tions there produced almost a
third of a million pieces of pot-
tery, arrowheads, and trade goods.

:WisI1 We '1! Re Here   A"

Much has been said about the proposed core-curriculum
plan which is now under consideration‘ here,. and much

. ’ A

much more Will be said before the program, is ﬁnally ac-
cepted—and wehcan say here and now that »we hope the.
two (years of research and testing will produce a sound
and Valuable program for liberal arts education. Although
we who are now enrolled will not beneﬁt from the pro-
gram at Pitt, we like thelsound of it and wish we could

“have had the benefit‘ of such a plan. It would have saved 7
many of us from ﬂoundering around trying to decide what ’

we wanted to major in, how we were going to meet the
field requirements, what electives we should take,.and in
general, how could we get the best education for our money
that would enable us to compete successfully in a business
world and ‘also manage to obtain the most value. and en-

 joympnt from a liberal education that would set us up

 alongside our fellow men as good’ and able citizens in ‘a9    

democratic country but a mis-managed world.

_ Please do not get the wrong idea. This core curriculum
is not the last word in_ education or is it going to make
perfect people but of average students. Neither is it a new,

» untried system of education that is the product of a mini

orityof idealistic educators. Core curriculum studies, under
many different names, have been put into practice and are
currently operating at many of our colleges and universities
throughout the country. It operates with varying degrees
of success, depending upon..students, faculty, and the quali-
ty of the original program.  ' i

\ When the committee ﬁrst proposed the plan and dur-
ing the eight months study of methods to improve liberal
arts education, the “cor_e” idea met with active opposition.
The pros and cons of the proposition were debated in every

_corner of the University where two or more College in-

structors could be found and the discussion reached warm
climates jmore than once.

In the end, the recommendations of the College Self
Study Committee were approved and the program_will go’
into operation for two years of study and testing of methods.

To restate the aims of the proposal, the new program

is designed to provide the undergraduate with greater in- -

tellectual skills, improve the quality of his judgments, and
increase his knowledge concerning the methods of science
and of understanding man.  «  _

The successful operation of this program will rest with
the men of the committee who willspend the next two
years eating, sleeping, talking, thinking, and dreaming in
terms of core curriculum. It will require exhaustive studies,
of other programs and their methods, and conferences with
people who developed and administered them. It will re-
quire the full—time energies of the committee. _It is an am-
bitious program and one that will require not only time

and effort but skill and patience on the part of its workers. '

.We can only wish them -success and leave them with the
thouht that we wish we could beneﬁtfrometheir work. It
will be well worthwhile. ‘

‘5 of the Dodo bird._

By Dave Green ~

As expected, the new core curriculum program
in the college annouriced by the University re-
cently has provoked heated debate on the merits
of the idea. Regardless of whether the new plan

. is good or bad, however, its approval by the faculty

does reassure many people that a concern for the
beneﬁts of a liberal education does exist at Pitt.

Many educators have been alarmed for the
,past few decades at the increasing degree n of
specialization to which college students have sub’-
jected themselves. Assuming, and probably rightly
so, that college is a ‘place 0 prepare one’s self
for a future vocation student emphasis was pri-

.marily placed on pre-vocational training. Where.
, most students in the past went awry though was

that they believed that job preparation was the‘
ONLY thing they were in school for. i

’ Of course, there have been exceptions, and .I
don’t mean those that came for an MRS, (that’s a

' vocation too) but educators generally feared that

the scholar who selected courses from many ﬁelds
of learning for learning’s sake was going the way
Communication V Difficulty ,

In an effort to please prospective employers,
students were forced to learn as ‘much as they
could about a speciﬁc ﬁeld. The specialist had a
better chance of getting a job than the dreamer
who was more concerned about Homer, Plato, and
the rest of that crowd which commercial minded
personnel ofﬁcers regarded‘ as “has beens.”

T Specialists got along ﬁne with similar special-
ists but it soon became apparent that someone who
knew nuclear physics inside and out didn’t have
a hell of a lot in common with an expert on ﬂuctua-
tions in the New York Stock Exchange, unless they
happened to be talking about "the uranium market.

Alarmed by this situation where men of differ-
ent ﬁelds had no “common ground,” the College
Self—Survey committee looked around to ﬁnd just
what courses college students were taking, and ‘how
these courses were helping them in their subsequent
vocations. 1 V —

Results Appalling . ~

The results, as expected, were appalling. Po-

They Finally Came Through  . .

 
   

Core Curriculum

litical Science majors avoided ‘chemistry’ and physics
like the plague, and students in the natural sci-
ence put the quarantine sign on the departments
of classics, philosophy, and the like. Even if a
student did resolve to get himself a liberal educa-
tion, he found it difficult to work—in courses in
a. great many areas into his_ schedule.

Polls of business readers indicated that import-
ant men in commerce were also concerned about
the inability of their employees to do or even talk
about anything that was not part of their par-
ticular specialties. While men at lower echelons
of industry still preferred a man who _could do a
given job, the “big brass” of the commercial. world
expressed chagrin over the lack of liberal education

V among their employees.

Two-Fold Purpose ~
The new core curriculum program, in the words
of the committee, is aimed at preparing students

‘for democratic living. It hopes to produce not

only English majors and economists, but also use-
ful private citizens who have an adequate back-
ground to understand the problems of their fellow
men, regardless of their specialty. , _,

How will the new system affect Pittites? No-

body here now will be bothered ‘by it. The new ‘A A

courses will not be drawn up until the spring of

1955, and they won’t be tested via. pilot classes —

until the fall of that year. The program .will then
be tried on groups of freshmen.

If the courses prove satisfactory, they will,
after review and approval by thefaculty, be put
into use.

Obiections Raised . . r

Objection has, of course been voiced. One com-
plaint is, can instructors, now accustomed to spe-
cialized teaching, handle courses covering wide
areas of knowledge? “Yes” says Dr. Putnam Jones,
chairman of the self study committee. -He believes
that instructors involved, given adequate time to
prepare courses, should be more than able to handle
the job.

The plan suggested is not perfect. Those who
endorse it know this. The plan, however, is only
a device to re-emphasize the importance of liberal
education in a university. . I almost wish I was
entering Pitt again, Class of 1960.

I would like to take this means

themselves to the traditional and

ITm condemning our expansion
program but what will become
of these buildings after the city
decides to converge on Oakland
with the infamous“ “Tow Away”

signs so familiar to downtown
streets? Some people will say
that won’t happen for_ a» few
years but our new buildings are
being built for the future so why
can’t we planiaparking for the
future at the same time?

How about a proposal like this:
To coincide with the proposed
underground parking facilities
planned to be constructed under

the‘ Soldiers and Sailors Memo— ‘

rial, why can’t we also dig a lit-
tle deeper under our new ediﬁces
arid provide ‘av replacement for
the spaces we are taking from
the Oakland district. Even bet-
ter, a larger plan could be pro-
posed for beneath our“ beautiful
lawn which will not and should
not be destroyed.

Congress’ action on making a
committee chairman responsible

lems in the planning of the dance

If They Can Do It  . .A

With this proposal I believe we
could have our greens awhile
making use of them. Now the
skeptic questions, “How can you
even dream of such a plan: how
could we park under the lawn
and still have it?” This, you of
the pessimistic class, is being
proved. this very moment in
downtown Pittsburgh at the
parking garage-community park
which is under construction.

Another question raises its
ugly head. Where will we get the

money for these projects? As for,

that, the garage could, in‘ time,
pay for itself by charging a small
fee for the use of it. After all the
lot where we are about to erect
our new buildings is and has
been quite a handsome business
to the owners.

Think it over fellow Pitt men
and women. We all should have
an interest in our community
away from home.

‘Thanks

mittee‘ who worked untiringly for
a successful affair. These peo-
ple met weekly prior to the dance
and saw to it that all details were
handled efliciently.
To these people and ‘many
more, again I say—thanks.

Heavyweight Grid Grapplers

Hits Grapplers ’ Camp

By PAUL HARRISON
A gaping hole in the wrestling lineup continues to
worry Coach Rex Perry as the Panthers move into their last
tune—ups before hosting Toledo at the Field House Satur-

day night.

The heavyweight slot, one of the most important posi-
tions on the squad, is yet to be filled. This is due mainly
to football injuries which have sidelined two of the three

grapplers who were vieing for
the bigman of the team.

Eldred Kraemer, last year’s
stellar heavy, and Ed Stowe. have
been forced to hang up their togs
Ior most of the season, if not all.
After seeing his hopes dwindle,
Peery has given the nod to Harold
Hunter, a Canonsburg junior, who
compiled a 4-4-1 record last sea-
I0n. _

Toledo Tough

"I think it’ll take some time ‘for
Hunter to come around to hisbest
shape,” Peery conﬁded, “and with
this tough Toledo gang coming I
think I have cause to worry.”

“Tough Toledo gang” isn’t the
half of it, as one look at their last
season’s accomplishments will re-
veal. The Ohioans grunted their
way to the Mid-American Confer-
ence Championships, were second
behind the Panthers in the 4-I’s
championship, and placed third in
the National AAU meets. Their
captain, Ed Lanzi, won the .177-
pound crown in the 4—I’s and was
ﬁourth in the -“world series of
wrestling,” the NCAA meets.

Two other Toledo stalwarts,
Dick Lefﬁer and Don Wem, ‘I37
and 167-pounders, both chipped in
leconds in the 4-1 matches.

Three Jobs Set

With these boys and others like
them comprising the ﬁrst barrier
tor the Panthers, Coach Peery has
I right to fret. ,

Even though the lidlifter is but
ﬂour short days away, Peery an-
nounced that only three of the
eight positions are set. Along with
Hunter, who is alone in the ﬁeld,

Tech Next Foe

For Freshmen

By GENE AROMATORIO

Pitt’s frosh ﬁve will be out
to better their 2-2 record when
they play host to the Carne-
gie Tech frosh on Jan. 13 at
the Pitt Field House.

' The Panther Cubs were
handed their second defeat of
the season by Duquesne’s “Little
Dukes,”. who edged the Jungle

and tuck battle all the way until
the Dukes gained ﬁnal command.

Last Monday night saw the Pitt
men engaging Westinghouse Ap-
prentice at the Memorial Field
House, with the Panthers coming
out on top, 75-64. The ‘Cats had
to come from behind to pull the
game out of the ﬁre.

Rally Wins Second

Pitt was trailing by 19 points
midway in the third quarter when
they got hot and rapidly started
closing the gap. They recovered
from. the 19-point deﬁcit and
forged ahead to whip Westing-
house by 11 points.

Westinghouse is the only team
able to boast of victory over Du-
quesne’s frosh.

In staging the rally to down
Westinghouse the Panthers play-
ed their best game to date. As
Coach Carl Peterson said, “The
boys proved they had a lot of
ﬁght by coming so far behind.

Full of Fight

Coach Peterson reported that
Darrell —Lewis and Don Lenhart,
two freshman footballers who got
a late start with the squad, are
beginning to round into shape and
are giving starters Joe Toth and
Bob Lazor a ﬁght for their posi-
tions.

Peterson remarked that Lewis
and’ Lenhart are “beginning to
shoot well and they’re full of
ﬁght”

average of 44%. Other accurate
ﬁring Buckeyes include sophomore
guard Robin Freeman, who has a
21 point average, and ‘junior for-
ward John .Miller, who is scoring
at a 17-point rate.

The all-time series shows the
Blue and Gold behind 11-8. The
last time Pitt won was in 1940-41
and since then the Ohioans have
taken nine consecutively. ‘

Timmons will start the same
lineup that he has been using all

Dick Deitrick will be in at the
opening whistle. The football
star has apparently taken the cen-
ter position from Dave Duessel

boards. _

Sophs May Play

Other starters are Ed Pavlick
and Bernie Artman at the for-
wards and Captain Dutch Burch,
the team’s leading scorer with a
13.2 average, and Joe Fenwick at
the guards.‘

In the games last week against
Ivy League visitors, Columbia and

Conference Talk
Will Spur Interest

By RUSS FRANKE

‘consider entering the game in the

Sports Editor

 

Chancellor Fitzgerald’s disclosure that Athletic Direc-
tor Tom Hamilton is feeling out other Eastern schools with
a View toward forming a major- conference will no doubt
create a healthy stir in an otherwise dim athletic picture.

Pitt football and basketball fans have had little to
cheer aboutsince the start of the fall semester, and many
of them refuse to credit the promises that better days are

just around the corner. But the possibility of entering some .

kind of a league is due to spur plenty of interest.

Almost every person who hears such conference talk
immediately begins to tick off mentally the colleges he feels
would make good athletic companions, especially in foot-
ball.

Invariably he picks the stronger grid powers of the East
--Army, Navy, Penn, West Virginia, Penn State, Villanova,

and a few others———regardless of their availability or will-

ingness.

Capt. Hamilton, oranyone else, for that matter, would
have a difficult time trying to organize all the schools in a
group that has only geography in common. Army and
Navy, since they are service schools, have been thumbing
down overtures for ‘years, even though their cooperation
would just about guarantee a successful union.

Penn and West Virginia are pledged to their own con-
ferences, ‘and getting them to break existing ties would en-
tail considerable persuasion. Penn does not always see eye
to eye with the Ivy League athletically, but obviously it
fancies the scholastic prestige of the group.

Penn State and Villanova are really the only ones avail-
able and probably willing, although We do not profess to
know the policies or desires of any of these institutions.

But we can speculate with the, best of them, and let
Capt. Hamilton do the Work. ‘

‘Kenny George, athletic business manager, reports a
brisk December sale in football season tickets——the only ap-

' preciable December sale in history. This year the office

conceived the idea of season tickets as Christmas gifts, and
the attractiveness of the certiﬁcates themselves helped the
ideal along, to say nothing of Minnesota, Notre Dame, Navy,
Northwestern, and Penn State.

By the way, there is no truth to the rumor that student
manager Al Markowitz will play in tonight’s game at Ohio
State. . -

If Sooners Can A
Claim Title-
Why Can’t We?

It’s a rare day whenia team
with a mediocre 3-5-1 season
record is suddenly vaulted into
the running for the mythical
national grid championship.

But such is the case of the
Panthers as Oklahoma found a
soft spot in the Maryland Ter-
rapin’s hard shell in the Or-
ange Bowl and has been
crowing about it since.

“We’re No. 1 now,” they’re
chanting. .

“OK,” agree Panther fol-
lowers,” they’re on top and
we tied them, so we must be
just as good.” M

Despite an y forthcoming
claims of higher rating by
Notre Dame, West Virginia,
Minnesota, Northwestern and
Penn State, all Panther con-
querors, Pitt is now ready to
challenge Michigan State.

Swim Squad "

Pitt’s fortunes in swimming
competition this year will be
very- _d e p e n d e n.t on the
“breaks”, according to Ben
Grady, coach of the tank
team. With a strong aggrega-
tion of breast-strokers, long
distance treestylers, divers and a
shortage of sprinters and back-
stroke men, a prediction of a com-
pletely winning season would

have to be made with tongue in

check.

A principal weakness of the
team lies in its inadequate re-
serve support for the regulars.
The starters are capable enough,
but they can’t be expected to car-
ry the entire burden, especially

- against such stiff competition as

Ohio State, N avy, and Lehigh. _
This depth problem will be espe-

« cially noticeable this winter -since

the ﬁns have their longest dual
meet schedule in history besides
having to defend their Eastern
Collegiate Swimming Association
title in March.

At present, the tankmen are
working out daily at the Pittsburgh
Athletic Association pool.

__,The season gets under way on
January 16 with the Pitt tankers
meeting Ohio University. In their
meeting last year, the Panthers
triumphed ‘ handily, 53-25.
