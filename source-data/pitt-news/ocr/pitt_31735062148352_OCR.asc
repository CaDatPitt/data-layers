War Address by Page

- Highspot of this year’s Inquiry I
Forum lecture-series will :be reached 1 _

at 12:30 "o’clock” today when Kirby
Page, world-famed author and» au-
thority on ‘international. relations,
brings‘ to the University-campus
America’s most vital question: “Must ;
W,_e Go To War?”

-‘Mr, Page, who is the author of 19
volumes on international, economic,
social, and religious ‘questions, will
review the causes of the present Eu-
ropean conflict and discuss the ques-
tion‘ of America’s present responsi-
bility. :

Following his Inquiry Forum ad-
dress, Mr. Page will expand his re-
marks dealing ‘ particularly with
“Youth in Today’s World of Con-
ﬂict” in a special dinner-discussion
at 5:45 o’clock in the Y clubrooms,
Forbesand Bouquet streets.  Tickets
for tonight’s round table discussion
are available at 35 cents in " the
YMCA office. ' '

An outspoken advocate of Amer-
ica’s non-intervention in ‘European
“power politics,” Mr. Page has de-
clared that the present war “is not a
war between democracy and totali- ',
tarianism, but a death grapple be- {
tween rival imperialisms, with ag-
gressors arrayed against oppres-
sors.” “Hitler caused the war but
the Allies caused =Hitler,” the be-
lieves.

‘To the question “How can Hitler’s 5
threat to democracy be now re-
moved?” Mr. »-Page has written that
“Hitler was hurled into a dictator’s ‘
seat by the despair and desperation;
and bitterness of the German people 
as a consequence of the ruthlessness
of the Allies’ policy of paralyzing!
Germany. The resultantmenace of 1
Hitlerism can never be destroyed by
war, but by that means will only be
spread more widely over the earth.”

The author’s ringing denunciation
of war and imperialism in his most
famous volume, “Must We Go To
War?” received wide recognition for 5
its complete analysis of the war ques- i
tion.

Power of Rice’s .D1~o.m§o;“Carrics
Pitt Players’ Second Production .

By Alvin Ma.-lakoft‘

Pitt Players can be mighty thank-
ful that Buell Whitehill, their direc-
tor, knows a good play when he sees
it. For despite the best effort and
best intentions on the part of many
of the cast in the latest Players pro-

duction, “Cou«nse‘-1or-at—Law,” it was

the strength of Elmer Rice’s writing
that put the show over. 1

The xveakness of the production
which ran on Thursday and Friday
in Foster Memorial, lay mainly in
the :i'ailure of the supportingroles
to support. Particularly, the women
diclrﬂt have
——attributes generally useful to foot-
ball players, but equally essential to
a good play. 1

Veinegar Stars ~

George Veinegar, C40, as George
Simon the “counsel(-_',” carried, in the
beginning, much of the play on his
shoulders. The plot unfolds his trib-
ulationsas a prominent attorney, up
from the bottom, who is threatened
with disbarment for an error of his
youth. Woven into the plot, too, is
the story of his marital troubles. But

{most of all the play carries a pan-

Dr, Tpwomey Concludes Survey

Of Birds I nhabiting New Mexico

Dr. Arthur Twomey, new1y-ap-
pointed lecturer in ornithology, re-
cently returnedfrom a ﬁeld trip in-
to the Southwest,” where he has con-
cluded a survey of the bird life of
New Mexico.

One thousand bird skins, two hun-
dred reptiles, and several species of
large mammals were brought back
from thetrip by Dr. Towmey, Who is-
ﬁeld ornithologist of Carnegie mu-
seum. Included among these ani-
mals are prairie Wolves, wildcats,
and the j_avelina,_or collared peccary,
a Central American animal that oc-
casionally wanders into the United
States.

Dr. Twoney has made six expedi-
tions into the’Arctic and sub-Arctic,
and has explored some of the blank
spaces on the map of Northern
Cana‘dla." Collecting in ,_all of "North,

‘He says that Mrs. Twomey, “who
always accompanies him, enables him
to do twice the work he normally
could accomplish by doing the routine
work around camp. “It’s a fasci-
nating life,” says Mrs. Twomey,
“and never dull. I’m always busy
with something, either cooking our
meals, skinning birds, or helping my
husband collect.” ' _ ‘
1Although their work took them
from 115 degrees in the desert to the
frosty weather of the_high moun-
tains, the Twomeys found the most
interesting part of the state, ornith-
o1ogi,ca11y_ speaking, to be in the
southwest corner. ‘ I '

Probably no better ‘portrayal ex-
isted in the show‘ than Mabel An-
derson as Bessie Green. The blowzy
cheapness of the switchboard opera-
tor was well,done. This type is not
uncommon, but she rescued the part
from the stereotyping that has come
in the years since “Counselor-at-
Law” was ﬁrst produced. 1

Cutting Damages Play 7

comedy relief in a play badly dam:
aged by cutting, since Rice wrote in
the “realistic” izein. Leo Harter"as
John Tedesco,-Simon’s partner, show-
ed the best ‘thought out and best act-
ed of all the “roles. ‘ 

Peggy Nelson was good. asfa rela-
tively genteel _“bedroom artist.” Ma-
rie Gilbert carried off Cora Simon,
“society stuff,” with her acting as
well as herJc__lothe‘s. ChucklFreeble
and Kay Hess were “sweet little
brats.” ” I

Milt Moskovitz deserves special
mention for mis-reading a vital part
and still making it .effective. Mos-
kovitz should have gone down to
YCL headquarters or a similar place
and heard how‘a Communist really
spouts off. " ' ' _ _

The rest of ‘the supports either
carried their parts with ease, if
without distinction, or contributed
vitally to the slowing up of the show.

over. " ’ '

The Trustee Investigation:
Events in the Background

Little has been said at the University since the latter part of
October about the report of the investigating committee of the
Board of Trustees. With the Board meeting next week, presumably
to discuss this report in more detail, it will be well for University
students to note the situation which prompted the investigation
and to understand the present status of the report.

This report on the University ’s administration was prepared by
a committee of seven members of the Board of Trustees, appointed
cn.M_arch 20 of this year at the request of Chancellor John G.
Bowman, to “study the situation at the University in all of its
phases.” The appointment of this committee followed closely on
the heels of the resignation of head football coach Dr. John B.
Sutherland. '

l During the investigation, thecommittee held 18 meetings, and
received 'testimony——frorn ofﬁcials, deans, faculty members, stu-
dents, and alumni——which covered over a record of over 400 pages.
On,,,Septc_~mber 18, a 49-page report was given at a special meeting
of the Board of Trustees. On October 17, the Board received Chan-

cellor -Bowman’."s reply to the report, and at that time the full text ,

‘of-"the: reportof the special committee was madepublic.

  did the report containig After pointing out that the Uni-
versity. has grown rapidly in enrollment, buildings, and educational
services during the last 20 years, the trusteesreported that Pitt is
esuﬁering from “an acute case of ‘growing pains’.”

A Symptoms of these “growing pains” include faulty administra-

tiveto!rg,aniz2itio1i, the need’ of better library, laboratory, and student '

union, facilities, the lack of aniofﬁcial code of faculty tenure, the
abruptness of the change inathletic policy, and unsatisfactory press
relations. ’

Most signiﬁcant fact about this report is that the trustees of "

the. University have recognized that deﬁnite impI’0VemeI1tS must
be madeaif Pitt ‘.‘.is to have cleartitle to the full conﬁdence of all
parts of its ofﬁcial family, to the respect! of other educational
institutions, and to the support of thepublic.”

~It .i-sunfortunate that the greatest emphasis of this controversy
isholuld be given to the athletic situation, and especially tothe resig-
Ii_atiQn’_,o,f JockSutherland. This incident, as the trustee report in-
dica-t'es,:-and as the Pitt News ‘pointed out last year, is merely one
aspect of a"s_ituation which has extended throughout the University.
J.  Naturally, there must be a target for the criticism which has
been going on. That target has been Chancellor Bowman.

‘ _  Since this semester has started, there has been a deﬁnite change
in the attitude of some Pitt students toward this affair. Instead of
lsendingvdelegations to the a.d,1ninist.1'atio11 to inquire about the rela-
.tions1i’ii5" bétV:v'een‘Jack .S.i1t.lier'.la1.3Cl' and the University, as sea did
last fall, students denounce those who criticize the Unciversity, as
Patsy G_rifﬁth, president of the women’s senior class, did at the re-
cent football banquet.

_ But whileimany students have come to resent the unfavorable
publicity directed, at the University and particularly at the chan-
cellor, they have not noticed one important fact. The spirit at Pitt
has changed, but nothing deﬁnite has yet been done about the situa-

tion which has aroused so much comment, and which was investi-

gated by the trustees.

This report is now in the hands of the executive committee of

SFA’S Executive Committee
Receives Financial Reports

Last ThuI_‘sda.y"s SFA executive committee meeting brought
some i11te1*e.§'ti.i_:‘g- thing's. to light. A ﬁnancial report is always -in-
iterestiiig, especiially in any form of self-g‘ovcrn1nent. "l.‘..hese reports
;.are particularly in.teresting because of the rnurmurings of members
of the ailzniiiistznzitioii about bad management of SFA ﬁnances and
‘talk about taking away some of the group financial power.

For example, the report showed that the soph “Screwball. Hop”
Ipade a proﬁtiof 55171.5() while the freshman “I-’il.,grim Prance” lost
between:-$190 ai.1d,_, $20(). Since the funds of both dances came from
the general activities fund,‘little money was lost.

But the most interesting fact is that the oﬂicial report o;E the
SFA football banquet reports no loss. As we understand it, there
_we_re 550 people at the banquet of which about 150 were non-paying
‘guests. .. ‘We wonder how an affair like the football. banquet can be
run 'vvit‘hout a loss when it has such a large percentage of non-
paying guests. It will be interesting to see the full ﬁnancial report
of,.the_ dinner, which should be released by SFA soon.
 =-'~Bnt it'._tl.1e banquet could have been run under these adverse
,ei,i'fc1iinsta.ii}.:'es, and still not show a loss, it certainly 'isn’t a sign of
 management by SFA.

Trouble at Westminster
‘“The~I[olca(l. student newspaper of VVestminster college, has
been liaving a little trouble.
“ It seems that last year the student council at that school passed
a ruling limiting the number of points a student may have for extra-
.curri’cul.ar activities, similar to the system employed here by the
oflices of the dean of men and dean. of women. All possible candi-
dates for president of student council this year were ineligible un-
der this ra1ling_..»,..... » «
_ The ei(lito1- of the Hlolcad and one of the deans ca,-rried on inde-
pendent surveys to see how the point system worked at other
séhools. the editor through the publications of those schools,,the
dean through a study of colleges edited by a Stanford professor.
Their ﬁndings did not agree.

The editor, Mike Robbe, a Pittslnu_-gli. boy, made a statement.
“accusing Dean Kelso of giving false information to the stiulent
bodyabout the popularty of ‘point’ systems.” The editor had al-
1'ead,v'ca1ripaig11(i(l against the systéni. ‘

For this, according to an editorial in the December 1 issue of
the Holcad. s-.igne('l by the faculty adviser, Robbe has been “benched”
for two weeks for “lack of editorial judginent.” The Holcad, by a
vote of 4 to 3 of the sub-editors, is continuing publication during the
interim. In thissame issue is printed an apology by Robbe to the
dean.

Stalin Accused of alsity
As Russia Invades Finland

By “Senator” Ziskind

‘Among intellectuais it was cus-
tomary to speak in glowing terms of
the peaceful and altruistic foreign
policy of Soviet Russia. For Russia,
through its Foreign Commissar
Maxim Litvinov, acted to promote
collective security, sought to crush
aggression with economic sanctions
and force, and ﬁnally was responsi-
ble for framing the famous League

come out into the open, and the
world at last has found her out. Her

cries for peace, her “gallant” stand '

for unity, were more expressions. of
Communist opportunism. Behind
her noble front lurked Comrade

Stalin, the Caucasian robber, who

plotted and connived, awaiting the
day of the European bloodbath when
only he might triumph.

Russia is on the march to spread,

her “culture.” to Finland. Bolshe-
vist enrichment must make itself
felt on the clean, neat lives of the
Finns. The rise of the proletariat!
It must come! So Comrade Stalin.
we congratulate you! You have

Helsinki. You murder and mairn

make them “rise.”

She has '

Workers of the world! Unite!
Come to the defense of Russia! Fm-
land has threatened to invade her

territory! She is a victim of unpro-
voked aggression! Help her, or she
will perish!

And meanwhile in the United
States the Communist party speaks
of the “counter attack” which Rus-
sia made on Finland. Earl Browder,
making "use of the American right
of speech, warns a Yale university
audience against war “into which
your capitalistic system will lead
you.” The Daily lWo*rker, the United
States Communist party’s oﬂicial

f publication, insists President Roose-

velt forced Finland to invade Russia.

If there is anything we can learn
from these actions it is the com-
plete domination of the Communist
party by Moscow. No free thinking
group could display such complete
‘insanity of its own free will. The
average Communist Waits for Rus-
sia to act, then indorses the act upon
receipt of its “explanation” from
Moscow.

I believe in tolerance toward all

"American groups no matter how
,much I might disagree with their ,

utterances. But a group as obvious-
ly dominated by a foreign power as
the "Communist Party has no place
in ‘American life.

I insist: Either the Communist
party in the United States be

, crushed as a foreign controlled body,

or if proved otherwise, that its
membership undergo prompt mental
examination.

Mr. Kalwary did not object to this

A Editor, the Pitt News:

Allow me to join the ranks of
those who would say, “Fie to Bill
McElwain for his unqualiﬁed mud
paragr:-iph tossed at Kal Kalwary.”
' McEl.wain must be very, very
young and easily irnpressed by per-
sons with private ofﬁces and calling
cards. The athletic department of-
ﬁcials here have accomplished a
wonderful conditioning job on your
alleged sports writer. He would
have University students believe
that Dr. Jock Sutherland was not a

great teacher and leader, and that
,. Pitt football has been advanced be-
cause Dr. Sutherland was displaced.
, Furthermore, he doesn’t like the
idea of any student objecting‘ to a
banquet for football players. He
likes our new de—emphasi.s code, yet
likes to have football gloriﬁed. What
manner of man is thi.s‘McElwain?
Methinks he ought to go the whole

pays or take a course in Logic I.

FIIGM THE

SIDELINES

By BILL MCELWAIN
Sports Editor

[Editor’s note: Frank Miller, a bosom friend and managing
editor of a not-too-well—lcnown campus publication, has been boast-
ing that he could write our private column with his eyes shut. We
blindfolded him yesterday, and this is what happened.]

Athletics are in a muddle, and it is about time someone wiped
the windshield.

To begin: there are two kinds of sports, indoor and outdoor. The
first of these is played indoors and the second obviously, out-of-doors.

To continue: football is a game of chance played with an in-
ﬂated projectile on a ﬁeld of green, bordered with white and crossed
by white lines every so often. Four men in white play alternately
on oneiteam and then the other. Each time one of them whistles,
everybody jumps on somebody and then the whistle blows again.
This is called a penalty. VVhen nobody dives on nobody, it is called
a fumble, and is good for seven or eight points, This happens about
every, three minutes until an hour has passed; at which time every-
body leavesfor home and cold supper. . '
All-American Requirements

, Basketball, strangely enough, is precisely the sameas football,
only it is played in shorts and a halter. Hockey, a variation of foot-
ball, isn’t played anymore. ‘ .

‘ Each year an All-American team is_ chosen by all the sports
writers who, between themselves, manage to give every player on
every, team throughout the country a berth on some All—American
team or other. We couldmention ours, which includes such out-
standing All-Americans as Vllohosiﬁshoﬂ and Rzerquvsinski.

But suffice it to say that we consider no All-American team com-
plete without having on it at least two ends, tackles, guards, half-
backs; and oneeaeh of quarterbacks, centers, -fullbacks, and alibis.

, Then .th.eI:e.~.is:-the question of revising football rules “c1.t'th'e"con-
vention of coaches each year. VVe have long held the opinion that no
spectators should carry the ball but those in the ﬁrst ﬁve rows, and
then only in an emergency. ‘

Explains Conference Situation

' ,_ Football conferences are quite confusing. To clarify: first of all ,

there is the Big Six, then’ the Little Six; in close order come the Ivy
league, the Hibiscus league, and the Geranium league. The Big Ten
is simply the Big Six with four others added on. L

' _ To conclude: in clarifying the athletic situation, we have tried to
answer all questions. But there is still one that stumps us. In refer‘-
ence to the evils of football, which is played in things called bowls,
wemust ask: what is the worst bowl evil‘? This is one we cannot
answer. \Ve have referred it several‘ times to the U. S. Department
of Agriculture, with no results.

_ [Bill, maybe only one of your two readers will get the pun:
but there the column is. I don’t see why you gripe about writing
it. It runs like water! FSM.]

[Yes, Miller—and it’s all wet. Editor.] .

Basketball Performers Prepare
To Take Over Sports Headlines

By Phil Lynch

Old Man Football, through confusing Joseph E. Fan by making the
mighty topple and the unheralded rise, will be washed up as soon as the
“official” All-America is published, and old man Joe can relax for a few
brief moments, then tear his hair out when his popular cage team lets him
-down.

Pitt’s cage stars will soon be coming into their own, picking up the
athletic spotlight left limp by tired?

ually gains momentum, interest and
competition going at a much higher
pitch than at a comparable date in
last season’s campaign.‘

Tomorrow afternoon, a great early
season booking pits the championship
Phi Kappa quintet against Kappa
Sigma’s crack ﬁve in the top match
of today’s and tomorrow’s program.
These columns have eulogized the
prowess of the Phi Kap basketeers
for two weeks or more, but Thursday
the Kappa Sig’s squeezed out a 13-11
triumph over the Phi Delts, a peren-
nial fraternity front ranker._

All indications point to a tough,
ﬁght, and recollections of last year’s
Kappa Sig upset victory have Dick
Cassiano and his teammates on the
anxious seat. Kracum, Kish and
company are a distinct threat in this
year’s fraternity race.

Today’s best independent battle in-
volves the Blizzards, a high scoring
outﬁt composed of fresh cagers, and
the Newmanclub, present occupants
of the independent ﬂoor throne. The
Newmans can really test Pitt’s future
varsity.

With the greatly increased entry
list, Director Jimmy: Potts has been

‘ snowed under by the amount of work

necessary to keep the program mov-
ing and has appointed ﬁve minor
solons to take charge of the statisti-
cal work. All questions on standings
are to be directed to Steve Horton

Dance Chairmen Report
Financial Proﬁts, Losses
Of Recent Class Dances

SFA Executive Committee Discusses Football
Banquet, Streit’s Lecture, Interfraternity Appeal

Listing a proﬁt of $171.50, the Sophomore “Screwball” Hop
made its ﬁnal report to the executive committee of the Student-Fad
ulty Assocation last Thursday. In contrast to this proﬁt, the Fresh-
man “Pilgrim Prance ” reported a loss of from $190 to $200.

Itemized accounts from ack
Stauif, C42, and Robert‘ Sullivan,
G43, chairmen, respectively, of the
two dances, included statements
on the ﬁnancial results of the
dances and also ‘lists of compli-
mentary tickets distributed. Sulli-
v'an’s“ report recommended that next
year’s Freshman Dance be scheduled
for a more appropriate time, _S1Y1C9_ the
day“ before the Thanksgiving holiday
proved to be unsatisfactory for this
affair. _

" In the future written authorization
from "either the office of the dean of
men or of thedean of Women W111 be
required of those committees who ap-
peal to the chancellor or provost for
ﬁnancial or other aid, the executive
committee ruled. , ' H K _

This‘ ruling W is necessitated by the
fact, that too many persons have been
going to Dr.- John G, Bowman and
Rufus Fitzgerald on behalf of some
activity sponsored by SFA, thus cre-
ating a great deal of confusion.

Sample questionnaires
the football banquet for next year
will be sent by the SFA statistics
committee to presidents of men’s and
women’s social fraternities. Ques-
tions to determine methods of im-
proving the aﬁair will be included.

This year’s football banquet, head-
ed by Clarence Shepard, BA40, W3-S ‘<1
success, the committee was told. SFA
did not incur any ﬁnancial loss on the
affair. _

The ~ lecture by Clarence Strelti
which was under the joint ‘sponsor-
ship of SFA and the International Re-
lations Club was termed a success by
the executive committee, although
SFA had a’ small ﬁnancial loss.

The appeal of Interfraternity Coun-
cil for SFA to contribute to the food
drive being conducted by that g1"0UP
was refused. The committee stated
that funds received from the state
are for - educational p1_11‘p0SeS, 3n_d
therefore cannot be given to this
cause. All members were urged,
however, to make individual contri-
butions to the campaign.‘

Mackey Urges
Students to Get
Quartet Tickets

Tickets for the free performance
of the Stradivarius String quartet

should be secured as soon as possi— 1

ble, urges Dave Mackey, E40, chair-
man. The quartet will appear in
Foster Memorial, Thursday at 3
o’clock.

The quartet is appearing on camp-
us under the co-sponsorship of the
department of music appreciation
and the SFA concert hour commit-
tee. “It is the most important out-
side musical organization to appear
at the University this year,” an-
nounces Mackey.

As part of the Association of
American Colleges Concert project,
this foursome is being heard at uni-
versities throughout the country, he
points out.

Because of a limited seating ca-
pacity and in order to facilitate invi-
tations to outside organizations,
which can only be made after the
number of extra seats are determin-
ed, students should secure their tick-
ets now. They are available in
the information room and hostess’
ofﬁce, ﬁrst ﬂoor, Cathedral, the of-
ﬁces of the dean of men and the dean
of women, the music department of-
fice, 442 Cathedral, and in 106 State.
