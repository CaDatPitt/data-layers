General Gavin Criticizes
Administration’s War Stand

“Never has there been such widespread misunderstanding about the role of tech-
nology in foreign affairs,” said General James M. Gavin (ret.), a current critic of the
war in Vietnam.. Speaking before the World Affairs Council of Pittsburgh, the General
was highly critical of the assumptions underlying the Administration’s conduct of the

War.

“The lack of understanding of technology stems from a lack of understanding of

the source of a nation’s power Gavin said. He felt that this lack of understanding has
led to “grave deterioration” of the nation’s position both on the national and interna-

tional levels.

On the national level, Gavin cited the unrest in the nation's cities, which he termed a “tearing
apart of our social fabric.” He observed that the money that was being spent on the war could be
put to use at home, where he felt it is more desperately needed.

Gavin also saw a moral prob-
lem stemming from our failure
in’ the slums. “The degree to
which we tolerate violence in
our behavior abroad is depen-
dent on how much we tolerate
violence in our cities,” he said.

This incompetence to under-
stand the drift of history and
our society, according to Gavin,
has as its most basic cause our
propensity to predict the future
from past experience. Gavin
cited some of the mistakes that
this has led us to.

One of the mistakes was the
Torrey Canyon disaster, where
a monster oil tanker polluted

the shorelines of southern Eng- .

land and parts of France when
it broke up at sea. Gavin point-
ed out that we did not have the
means -to deal with the disaster,
and that there are now tankers
on the drawing boards that are
planned to carry ﬁve times as
much oil as the Torrey Canyon
did. “As -of now,” he said, “we
have no way to deal with these
ships.”

Another example was the
Thalidomide affairs, where im-
proper testing of a new drug
led to horribly deformed babies.

Gavin felt that the greatest
of the technological problems
facing mankind, however, is
that of nuclear ﬁsson. “Man has
now controlled the power of the
face of the Sun,’ "he said. “There
is no where else to go.”

The effects of ﬁsson upon
warfare are profound, Gavin
pointed out. The mo-st impor-
tant thing, he felt, was that in
any future war where ﬁsson
bombs were used, “There would
be no victors but many victims.”

The alternative to nuclear war,
limited conventional warfare,
has been -on the increase, Gavin
said. He felt that this was .a di-
rect result of the impossibility
of nuclear war. However, at the
same time, many of these small-
er wars, such as Korea, have
ended in stalemate precisely be-
causethe means to come to an
ultimate solution, nuclear weap
ons, are too horrible to use.

Gavin’s most caustic com-
ments, however, were saved for
Vietnam, which he termed as
“not a test of our endurance but
-a test of our wisdom.” He felt
that the war was “not vital to the
security of the United States.”

Gavin’s conclusion was that
“Our Vietnamese involvement
shows our lack of understand-
in-g of current military proce-
dures. We should not have gone
to war unless we wanted to at-
tack China. An invasion of
North Vietnam is impossible
without «involving China.”

RecognitionCommittee
Reviews Constitution
Changes By 4 Groups

The Student Government (SG) Recognition Committee
met Thursday to consider the pending constitutional chang-
es of four campus organizations. The organizations Pl'esent-
ing themselves before the committee were Angel Flight,
ROTC Cadet Brigade, Student Union Board (SUB), and

Men's Council.

Angel Flight, the women's auxiliary 12;; the Arnold Flight So-
ciety, was granted continued (ﬁull) recognition.

The ROTC Cadet Brigade will be granted continued recogni-

Lantern Night Ceremonies

BUSH, as Alma a r, o -
ﬁcially welcomes freshman
women as members of the Uni-
versity community.

by ALICE GOLDSMITH

The Associated Women Stu-
dents (AWS) sponsored the Lan-
tern Night ceremonies Friday
night in Stephen Foster Me-
morial and in the Commons
Room of the Cathedral of Learn-
ing. Lantern night is an annual
ceremony which marks the for-
mal induction of freshman wom-
en into the University commun-
ity and it is the oldest tradition
for women -on campus.

This candlelight ceremony
stresses the meanings and Val-
ues of becoming a University
woman and the responsibility
involved in maintaining the tra-
ditions at the University.

-Mary Gamrcar, AWS Lantern
Nuight chairman, coordinated the
efforts of her committee with
those of the Traditions Commit-
tee, who wrote the initiation test
which all freshman women took
the preceding week in their Men-
tor meetings. The Alumnae
Women and the Dean of Wom-
en’s <Office worked with these
groups .to plan «the program.

In the first half of the cere-
mony, which was held in Steph-
en Foster Memorial, the fresh-
men and their Mentors were
welcomed by Miss Garcar and
were presented with symbolic
lanterns which represent the lan-
terns carried by the University's
first students, when the school
was known as the Pittsburgh
Academy.

Father Pitt, portrayed by Vic-
ki Rashbaum, told the group of
the many classes she had wel-
comed to the University‘ before

leading the group to the Cathe-
dral. In the candlelight Com-
mons Room, Father Pitt pre-
sented the freshman to Alma‘
Mater for recognition as Univer-
sity women. Alma Mater was
portrayed by Ann Bush, pressi-
dent of AWS.

As new members -of the stu-
d-ent body, the -Class of 1971 ac-
cepted the light of truth from
upperclass ﬂam.ebearers who lit
their lanterns and repeated the
following pledge: “By this ﬂame
within my hand, I pledge my
word, 0, Alma Mater, to seek

both for myself and for those
who follow me, the inner light
of Truth.” “

The Lanterns were presented
to each freshman from Alum-
nae who were asked to contri-
bute the cost of one lantern so
the tradition could be preserved.
Financial pressures necessitated
the use of candles for the last
two years. It is hoped the Alum-
nae support will continue this
practice.

Because -the freshman class
was so large this year, it was
necessary -to split the group and
to have two ceremonies.

Arab Ambassador Outlines
Policy for Israeli Opposition

by MYLES SAUNDERS
The foreign policy of Saudi Arabia (is simply to “befriend all
those who befriend us,” thus spoke that country's Ambassador, His

Excellency Ibrahim Al-Sowayel.

Speaking -to a meeting of the World Affairs Council of Pitts-
burgh Thursday, Al-S-owayel outlined the major attitudes and ob-

jectives of his country.

Saudi Arabia, stressed Al-Sowayel, was one of the charter

members of the United Nations
in San Francisco in 1945. In
carrying out its objectives, Sau-
di Arabia will respect the UN’s
charter. But at the same time,
the country is a member-nation
of and will support the Arab
League, Al-Sowayel pointed out.

The country’s first objective,
Al-Sowayel announced, is the
strengthening of ties between
Arab nations. This way the Is-
raeli aggression can be thwart-
ed in the Middle East. And it is
such aggression that is causing
turmoil in that area.

   

The Ambassador was quick to
qualify that statement. He said,
“We have nothing against the
Jewish people, themselves. We
object to their taking ou-r land.”

His Excellency foresaw no so-
lution to the Palestinian prob-
lems except the withdrawal of
Israelis from that area. For 19
years Palestine has been occu-

pied by the Israelis. For that‘

long, the Ambassador said, the
Arabs have been displaced.

 

  

>The Brigade must discon-
tinue its -marchving. The march-
ing  of the Brigade should
be ﬁltered ‘back to the Military
Science Department and should
not be a student orgariization
function

>The Brigade must also- elect
their officers instead of having
them -selected.

Representaltives of the ROTC
Cadet Brigade agreed to the
terms promulgated by the Rec-
ognitions Committee.

Both the S-UB and Men’s Coun-

cil are in the midst of chang- G

ing their constitutions. Until the
constitutions are completed, no
action can be taken.

NSA Pres.
Lectures At
Open Forum

Ed Schwartz, president of
the National Student Asso-
ciation Will be featured
speaker tonight at the ﬁrst
open forum of the Free Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. The for-
um, centered on the topic “What
Is a Free University?” will be
held in the auditorium of the
United Oakl-and Ministry Cen-
ter at Fifth and Belleﬁeld Aves.
at 8 p.m.

The National Student Associa-
tion became the center of much
publicity and controversy last
November when Ramparts Mag-
azine claimed that the NSA. re-
ceived funds from the Central
In-t-elligence Agency for sending
students to international meet-
ings and seminars. The NSA
now claims that all ties with the
CIA have been broken and will
remain so.

In addition to Schwartz, some
members of the faculty of the
Free University  also speak.
The forum is open to all inter-
ested persons.

The upcoming term at the
Free University offers courses
which span a wide variety of
subjects. Some of the courses
offered include: Chinese philoso-
phy and existentialism, the draft
in a free society, nuclear and
non-nuclear defense strategies,
contemporary art and drama
trends, and techniques of con-
sciousness expansion.

Those persons interested in
Free University courses will
have the opportunity to acquire
additional information about the
courses from the instructors at
the forum.

‘Marat Sade’ Asks

by MICHAEL BENNETT
Peter Weiss’ Marat Sade is. at
least, a brilliialntly successful ar-

tistic experiment in the bizarre.

The“ setting of the movie is
Napoleonic France, in 1808, at
the insance asylum of Charen-

‘ ton. The director of the asylum,

Dr. Coulmier, has decided that
the inmates of Charenton should
put on a play as part of their
therapy, the entirety of which
takes place inside one of the
cells of the asylum». The doc-
tor himself, along with his wife
and daughter are seated inside
of the cell, while his guests,
members of the Napoleonic rul-
ing class, are seated outside.
The play is to be directed by
none other than the infamous
Marquis de Sade, at the time an
inmate of the asylum, and is to
be concerned with the assassina-
tion of Jean-Paul Marat, la rev-

-olutionary leader of France in

the 1790's.

The acting‘ itself is brilliant,
especially since the actors, in ef-
fect, play two roles at once.
First of all, they had to por-
tray institutionalized psychotics
and at the same time interpret
the patients’ attempt to play the
roles that de Sade assigned them
in his play. There is an ingeni-
ous interposition of these two
factors throughout the movie,
which is, in fact, a play within
a play.

For instance, Corday’s friend
Duperret was played by an in-
mate who was an inveterate sex
 In de Sadeﬁs script, how-
ever, Dupperet-t was only Su1p~
posed to be her ﬁriend, and was
not to have any -other interest in
‘her. But in the scences where
the two are talking -(or sing-
ing) to each other, the imnate
playing Dwpperret can't restrain
himself from attacking Corday.

" ‘So actually there are two
story lines to follow. First the

story of Marat’s assassination,
and secondly the personal psy-
choses of the inmates. And to
make the plot even more ‘intri-
cate, Dr. Coulmier, the asylum’s
director, -often interrupts the
play when the inmate playing
Marat or “his people,” the rev-
olutionaries, become too involv-
ed with the idea of a revolution.
Indeed, at one point the doctor
interrupts the play and declares,
“VVe’re citizens of «an enlight-
ened age, we're all revolution-
aries, “We’re citizens of an en-
lightened age; we’re all revolu-
tionaries now.”

De Sade’s role seems to fall
out somewhere between Marat
and the doctor. At one point he
says, “Man is a destroyer. If he

kills and takes no pleasure in it
he is a machine.” But through-
out the play he is always criti-

uestions

cizing Marat for being a revol-
utionary. “How can you still be
a revolutionary?” he demands
of Marat. Conditions have not
changed, he points out, the peo-
ple are still poor. Revolution,
says De Sade, is always put
down by corruption among its
ranks.

There is a tension which is
carried on throughout the mo-
vie: a tension between the biz-
arre circumstances of the play,
and the real situation it is try-
ing to depict. Also, the dichoto
my between the sensuclist, De
Sade, and the revolutionist, Ma-
rat, carrys throughout the play.
And, by the very fact that both,
notwithstanding their one-time
success are inmates of an asy-
lum gives some hint of the
playwrights opinion «as to the
resolution of their never-ending
debate.

Penn Grad
Pulls Grant

PHILADELPHIA (CPS) — A
retired businessman has with-
drawn a $250,000 bequest to the
University of Pennsylvania be-
cause of an editorial in the stu-
dent newspaper calling for the

resignation of the V university’s
president.

James Miller Glicker, who at-
tended the Penn Law School,
objected because the newspaper
has “played it hard on the ears”
in its treatment of the president.

The paper printed the editori-
al last spring and reprinted it
this fall. It suggested that Pres-
ident Gaylord P. Harnwell had
accomplished a good deal in his
14 years as president but it was
time for him to step down in
favor of a younger man.

Glicker said he heard excerpts
of the editorial on a local radio
station and that it offended him
and his wife deeply.

Glicker suggested that the
newspaper staff ought to con-
sult alumni, particularly wealthy
alumni, before taking such edi-
torial stands. “Penn will pay for
this,” he added, saying he would
give his money to another Phil-
ade-lphia school, instead of the
university.

“When you speak over the ra-
die, every ‘nigger,’ everybody
else hears the whole damn
thing,” he said. “All kinds of
garbage mop this up and all the
Communist types love it.”

  Tuition: A Necessary Appraisal

An editorial in- Friday’s Pittsburgh Press dealt with the University’s
concern about its “dwindling percentage of out-of-state students.” It point-
ed out that 26 per cent of last year’s freshman class were from out-of-state
compared to 38 per cent in the 1965 class, a sharp contrast to the figure
of eight per cent for this year’s freshman class.

The Press attributed “a possible factor in the out-of-state enrollment
decline to the big gap between tuition for Pennsylvanians ($450 a year) and
tuition for others ($1400 a year) at Pitt, a ratio of more than three to one.”
Of the three state—related universities, all charge Pennsylvania residents
-$450, with Penn State charging out-of-state students $1050, Temple, $1350,
and the University, $1400.

“Penn State was saddled by legislative mandate with a $1350 out-of-

state tuition for a brief period until complaints by students and officials
brought a change. Pitt should begin moving in the same direction,” de-
clared the Press editorial.

We agree wholeheartedly with the stand taken by The Press, and urge
our students and officials to take action comparable to the efforts made
by Penn State representatives. All possible attempts should be made to re-
duce out-of-state tuition to the absolute minimum if we are to once more
attract a sufficient number of out-of-state students to forestall this Uni-

We reiterate that while the Admissions’ Office fine work may have
brought us Pennsylvania’s “2,000 best,” this is not good enough. There are
obviously valid reasons for the declining numbers of out-of-state students
attending our University. For example, we recognize that more and more
states are now providing tuition reductions for their own residents. How-
ever, we cannot use this as an excuse.

Our school is “state—related” but is not a state university. When we
became state-related, officials emphasized that we would still be retaining
the desirable characteristics of a private institution.

One of the most desirable characteristics is the attainment of a cos-
mopolitan university, with as diverse representation as possible. The $1400
tuition fee for out-of-state students is not helping us maintain this. It is
only one more deterrent in keeping away out-of-state students.

We urge our University officials to use all available means to lower
the tuition for out-of-state students to $1050, as it is now at Penn State.
We also advocate an expanded scholarship program to attract out-of-state
students to our University.

Our University once did attract great numbers of out-of-state stu-

dents. Our present statistics reveal, however, that we now require a new i

On State — Relatedness

THE NEW dormitories to
be built across from Pitt
Stadium will not be air-con-
ditioned. Only the first floor
will be so endowed.

The new dormitories will
not have air-conditioning be-
cause the State of Pennsyl-
vania, as personified by the
General State Authority,
will simply not pay for it.

Apparently, the Common-
wealth does .not feel that
University students need re-
lief from the somewhat less
moderate Pittsburgh sum-
mer.

THE TOWERS dormitor-
ies are air-conditioned, but
they were built with pri-
vate funds, when the Uni‘-
versity was a private insti-
tution, when the University
had almost complete con-
trol over its destiny.

But now it has come to
the point where some poli-
tical patronage-appointed
bureaucrat in Harrisburg
can decide whether Univers-
ity students will sweat dur-
ing hot weather.

It has come to the point
where some county officials
are bringing political pres-
sure to bear on the Univers-
ity to force Pitt to play its

home football games in the
new north side stadium, in-
stead of Pitt Stadium, be-
cause the County is inter-
ested in the new stadium’s
making money, and if that
includes emasculating the
University into a second-
rate campus, sans football
field, not to mention the in-
convenience to Students in
getting to the of'f-campus
stadium, well, that’s just
the way it will have to be.

IT HAS come to the point
where political hacks in
Harrisburg can argue and
hassle and procrastinate
over the state college-aid
bill, while the University’s
financial situation becomes
more and more disadvan-
tageous.

Perhaps state-relatedness
was the only way out for

this university. Perhaps the
Trustees knew what they
were doing when they pres-
sured Edward Litchfield to
resign as Chancellor.

But ever since then, this
university has lacked some-
thing of itself. It has lacked
its former direction, its mo-
tivating force. There was
once a dream of what this
university could become,

and there were stirring

speeches and grand plans,
and there was spirit.

ONCE WE were to be a
“cinderella” university, and

from virtually scratch make
ourselves a truly great na-
tional intitution. But mid-
night struck and those who
were to help us get there
turned back into rats and
pumpkins and the dream
dissipated quicker than you
could say Richard King Mel-
lon.

Now we are to be a “fine
regional university,” and
it’s not quite the same as
“the best university in the
country.” Whether we could
have become the best is
questionable but also irrele-
vant, because we were try-
ing just the same and it was
invigorating to be a part of
it.

Now we are part of a
Commonwealth system”
whose loyalty is to the state,
and to the state we must
subserve. Whatever we do
in the future must be done
in that context, but it used
to be that our eyes were on
bigger things.

NOW WE are a part of
educationally - deleterious
political machinations. We
are influenced by men
whose speeches are less in-
spiring, and whose plans for
us are less grand.

There is still one class
of student here that knew
what is was like to be part
of a grand design, and when
that class departs, it will
take with it the last of those
memories of dreams and
plans and the “romance of
learning.”

We may have had to be-
come a state—related uni-
versity, but there is still
one class here that remem-
bers the days when, on Sat.
urday afternoons, the Chan-
cellor of‘ the University
would stand up in his box
in Pitt Stadium, and, for
the benefit of thousands of
twisted-necked students, ex-

Students Hit Saga

‘Extravaganza’

Editor, The Pitt News:
Concerning the extravanga of
last Thursday night, we feel
that Saga Foo-d, Inc., would be
wiser to use its money to ap-
pease our stomachs rather than
our eyes. We simply cannot
agree that this type of enter-
tainment promotes better feel-
ings between Saga and the stu-
dent body, as it was in poor
taste. While some students en-
joyed the show, others, like our-
selves, were being repulsed by
the actions of one “young lady”

hired by Saga Food to dance;

To get the funds for this spec-’
tacular, we were informed that
Saga employees had to wear
their dirty uniforms again the
following day. Certainly clean-
liness should be the ﬁrst thing
on Saga’s menu.

We do appreciate Saga's ef-
fort to change the everyday rou-
tine. However, we feel that Go-
Go dancing is great in its prop-
er place. Unfortunately the cafe-
teria at dinner time is neither
of these. Therefore, we hope
that Saga 3. Go.-Go will go—go.

Reader Comments

On Hershey Talk

Editor, The Pitt News:

General Lewis B. Hershey, the
old expediter for President
Johnson's (policies) Vietnam, in
a speech delivered to draft eli-
gible University of Pittsburgh .
students told them “you must
either have to live up to what
your country is doing or get out
of it.” Like all (those) who sup-
port President Johnson’s for-
eign policy, with his failing me-
mory, he did not remind them
of the penalty of one year in
Vietnam or five years in prison.
Many Germans lived up to what
Hitler was doing and later done
it unto him. The picture is not
exactly rosey for the adminis-
tration if the commitment made
to Laos is as disastrous there
as can be expected. They may
have done unto them what they
are doing unto Vietnam.

During the General’s speech
students passed out for-real Her-
shey kisses, while the anatomy-
decorating type were reserved
by Hershey for the administra-‘
tion.

European Tour — Part III

University Students Enter 13th Century

by BETH LAZERICK

(Ed. ‘note: This is the third in a
series of articles about the 1967
Student Union European Tour.
Zlliss Lazerick was one of the
University students on the trip.)

As far as we were con-
cerned, the year was 1267
A.D. when we entered Ger-
many. The Pitt Crew, as we
came to be called, took a
steamer ride one afternoon
on the Rhine River Valley,
and from the deck we saw
what seemed incredible to
me — CASTLES, hundreds
of castles.

Our guide, Alf, knew the
names of every castle and he
did not hesitate to tell us about
each one. After the first few,
we stopped trying to remember
who lived in what castle at what
time. We did learn, though, that
“a ca.stle was a place which was
built to protect a family,” while
a palace was constructed for
pleasurable purposes.” This re
frain soon became “a palace is

constructed for love and a eas-
tle is for war,” and I do not
think any of us will forget this
fact!

Would you believe that a “So
ciety for the Preservation of
German Castles” actually exists?
VVell, wonder no longer because
it really does. We never did ﬁnd
out exactly what the group does,
bue we were intrigued by the
rame. Many of the castles and
palaces are now Youth Hostels,
though, and young people from
all over the world stay in them
during their travels through
Germany.

Then came Rothenberg. This
time the century was the 16th,
for Rothenberg is a medieval
city that has remained unspoil-
ed for over four centuries. With-
in the town walls which sur-
round_ three-fourths of the town,
the streets are cobblestone, and
the buildings are directly on the
narrow roadways. No one is al-
lowed to build or to repair any
building in Rothenberg if he
does not do so in the style of

the medieval city. Thus, the
town allows you to pretend there
is no 20th century.

At ﬁrst, Joe, our marvelous
bus driver, could not even ﬁnd
the Hotel Zum Barren because
of the narrowness of the streets.
But, ﬁnally Otto, whom we dis-
covered was not only our wait-
er but also the owner of the ho-
tel, managed to direct our bus
to it with a tiny American flag
he waved at us. The hotel was
like a museum. Our rooms had
delicately printed wallpaper,
feather comforters, dressing
tables, and l-ovely old ﬁxtures.
Conrad Hilton will never be able
to build a hotel like the Zum
Barren.

Although the town was me-
dieval in structure the people
and entertainment deﬁnitely
were not. The Saturday night
we were there, the streets were
crowded with people even though
it was not “tourist season.” Ev-
ery building, or so we thought,
had its pub and entertainment,
and music poured into the
streets.

A few of us were wailking
gingerly down the stone streets
when a group of young musi-
cians began to follow us. The
comments and salutations ﬂew
back and forth, and before we
knew it, we all were heading
into one of the restaurants.
Much to the consternation of
the people who were sitting
near us, the boys took their in-
struments, which were loud Ger-
man hunting horns and played
for us. And play well they did.

We “talked” the rest of the
evening although we could not
speak German and they knew
little English. Youth, it -seems,
is an international language, so
we had no trouble communicat-
ing.

Long after midnight we won-
dered wearily back -to the hotel,
only to discover that John Good-
worth, had not returned to his
roo-m, although he had been
seen heading back to the hotel.

The story of Goodworth’s mid-
night walk” was that someone
bet him that he could not drink
ﬁve mugs of wine (and they

were large mugs). Well, he
proved his friend wrong‘, be-
cause he downed those ﬁve
drinks, and those ﬁve drinks
nearly downed him, as it turned
out. Let it suffice to say that
Goodworth did not feel too well
the next day. No one would
have.

Sunday morning was a day
for church for some and for
shopping for others. For all of
us, though, Sunday was a day
to say goodbye to the 16th cen-
tury and to head into the mod-
ernity of Saltzbiurg, Au»stri=a.

(The Student Union is again
planning a five week flight and
tour to Europe ‘in April and May,
1968, and also a nine week flight
ONLY for June to August, 1968.
This year students may have the
opportunity to travel in Europe
as part of a classroom project,
but the details have not been
worked out about this yet. If you
would like to receive more infor-
mation about either of these
flights or the tour, please con-
tact Miss Harriet Friday, assist-
ant Director of the Union, 20

‘Privilege’ Deals

by STEVE GITTLESON
Stephen Shorter stands in the back seat of
a limousine as he whisks through the mobbed
streets of London. The onlookers roar. Stephen
Shorter appears on the stage of a large London
auditorium, clad in a gray flannel prison suit and
handcuffs, and imprisoned in a red police guard-
ed cage. The crowd roars. Stephen Shorter pleadingly
sings “Set Me Free.” The crowd yells back in unison
“Free, free, free.”
The guards release Stephen Shorter from his cage,

of these discotecques is built with a Stephen Shorter
Dream Palace “to keep people happy by buying Bri-
tish goods.”

At the beginning of the ﬁlm, Sh0rter’s stage
image is unique. He plays the role of the rough and
tough, undisciplined “prisoner” whose anguishing cries
to “set me free” from his stage prop prison cell ap-
peal to England's youth. They want to release hl‘T1

or, Shorter accepts an award with bitter contempt for
his loving fans. He says, “I’m nothing, you’ve made
me nothing. I hate you.” His fans completely desert
him by the following morning. He is no more than
an unpleasant memory.

Privilege is an exercise in the profound, but soon
shifts to the ridiculous, and ﬁnally, to the oblnoxioius.

Tutors Start Project

HEP Holds Orientation

by BEVERLY LOY TAYLOR

“You must have hope where
there is no hope,” said Bill
Strickland, speaker at the Hill
Education Project (HEP) Orien-
tation meeting Saturday. Hope
is the basis on which Project tu-
tors must begin their work in
the Hill District of Pittsburgh.

Strickland, a junior at the
University with two summers’
experience in Operation Head-
start, told the tutors that they
couldn’t teach a subject unless
the student wanted to learn it.
Often the student does not care
about it and resents the time
wasted on school work. Thus,
the ﬁrst and hardest job is to
make the tutee want to learn.

Speaking after the showing of
a ﬁlm on the Oakleaf Project,
an experiment in learning di-
rected by the University which
stresses aattention to individual
needs thiro-ugh the use of tapes,
records, and other special ma-
terials, Strickland contrasted the
ideallism of the ﬁlm expressed
with the realities of education
in the slum life of the 

Describing ghetto life, Strick-
land told of the “rat-infested
tenements, usually with no run-
ning water or toilet facilities.
Many homes don’t even have
electricity. How can children
study, even if they want to?
You’ll see these things when
you go into the chi~ldrén’s homes,
and I trust you will. It's very
important.

“With whole farnzilies packed
into a small, dark room, the kids
rarely stay home,” said Strick-
land. “They must go out, for

light, for air, for life. The peer
group shapes the individual. his
world view and his behavior.
Education is not on the group’s
list of priorities.” He pointed out
that the college student must go
into the ghetto and understand
his tutee in his own background
of apathy and degradation.

Loren Hershey, chairman of
HEP, stressed the importance of
turtors showing up for each ses-
sion with their tutees. In meet-
ings that Hershey has had with
principals of the schools cooper-
ating with HEP, the school ad-
minisntrators mentioned speciﬁ-
Cally, “College students come
into the tutoring situation, later
run into their own problems and
then don’t show up at meetings
with their tutees.”

Hershey emphasized, “By join-
ing HEP you have accepted a
responsibility to continue. Each
time the tutee comes to a meet
ing, he is responding to you.

You've established the begin-
ning of a rapport, and you can’t
quit in the middle of it. Ac-
cept the amount of time you
have signed up for. If you_ can’t
do that, don’t join HEP.”

Hershey added that the tutori-
ol system is geared to each child
and his individual requirements.
He said that tutors must “be
aware of their tutees’ needs.
Don’t go to your ﬁrst meeting

with preconceptions. Think about '

what you can do, meet your
tutee, and then be creative. Be
an individual in handling the sit-
uations as they occur.”

Tutoring begins this week.
Those not present at the ori-
entation meebing who are inter-
ested in learning more about
the program, may come to the

CHAMPAIGN, ILLINOIS — “We went
into the game feeling that we could win,”
said a dejected Dave Hart after in an un-
familiar locker room. Illinois had beaten the
Panthers, 34-6. He couldn't believe the outcome.
Defensive coach Bill Neal couldn't believe the
score. Neither could the players, who -simply
avoided everyone’s eyes and drifted towards the
waiting bus. ,

It hadn’t been like that the day before. The
Panthers knew they had worked hard during
the week. The offense was conﬁdent it could
move the ball against Illinois. The defense was
just as conﬁdent it could stop the Illini attack.

And both units did exactly that for 30 min-
utes. Expect for an opening march of 46 yards
for the only score in the first half, the Illini were
smothered by the Panther defense.

This was a defense that had been shocked on
their ﬂrst play when Greg Keller, after blitzing
to drop halfback Carson Brooks for a two yard
loss, suddenly hopped to the bench in agony. He
had planted his right foot down at the instant
two players -tumbled on -top of it. He was lost for
the game. Later he would watch helplessly on
crutches from the bench, a cast on his broken:
foot.

BUT FOR THE FIRST half the loss of Keller
didn't seem to affect the defensive unit. Terry
Hoover recovered quarterback Bob Naponic’s
fumble on the Illini 31. Joe Curtain intercepted
a Naponic pass intended for “All-American can-
didate” John Wright and ran it back to the Illi-
nnois 29. On the opening play of the second quar-
ter, Mickey Depp jigger-stepped 46 yards down
the sideline with an Illini punt to hand the of-
fense the ball on the Illinois 32.

Bu-t offensively, the Panthers couldn't put the
ball over the goal line. In addition to What the
defense set up, the offense had a drive of its own
which stalled on the Illini 25. In all, the Pan-
thers ran 25 offensive plays inside the Illinois 32
during the first half.

Illinois coach Jim Valek said afterwards that
he thought h.is defense would crack in the first
half because they were in so many pressure sit-
uations. The Panthers should have gone into the
locker room at halftime no worse than 7-7.

 Missed Chances Prove Fatal to Panthers

BUT THEY DIDN’T. DESPITE the fact that
130'? LODEO Played perhaps his ﬁnest game for
Pitt, the Panthers couldn't score. Long (ﬁve
catches, 100 yards) was the key man in every
‘thrust: he Was Open on virtually every play. But
quarterback Frank Gustine overshot  several
times. Gustine also overshot a wide-open Joe
McCain in the end zone. The sophomore signal-
caller failed on a fourth down sneak on the Illirﬁ
20. And placekicker Bill Zurzolo muffed three
ﬁeld goal attempts, one from the 16 yard line.

“We lost the game in the ﬁrst half,” Hart
said, shaking his head. “If we had scored any-
thing, we would have beaten them. Heck, even
7-3 is better than 7-0.” All the Panthers needed
was the psychological lift of a score.

As it was, when Illinois scored their second
touchdown, midway through the third quarter,
the Panthers fell apart. Sophomore defensive
back Dave Diblbley had narrowly missed a mid-
ﬁeld interception on a crucial  down pass
completion for Illinois which both termed the
turning point in the game. Diblbley then, later on
a third and goal from the six, made a sophomore
mistake in not picking up Wright, who was wide
open for a Naponic touchdown pass.

BEHIND 14-0, THE PANTHERS seemed to
give up. “We ran out of steam after their sec-
ond touchdown,” conourred Hart and Neal. Yet
there was still -better than a quarter left in the

game. The Panthers just began making mistake

after mistake from that point on.

When they got the ball on the ensuing series,
Gustine threw a sideline pass that was nearly
intercepted for a touchdown. Instead of throw-
ing between the defenders to hit the open Longo,
Gustine was passing right at the safetyman.
“Frank got a little rattled for the ﬁrst time,"
said Hart. “At times -he had Longo open and he
wouldn’t throw it.” .

Jeff Barr came in at quarterback and (threw
for the Panthers’ only score made possible by
a diving catch in -the end zone by McCain. But
inbetween, Illinois’ offense ﬁnally began to move
against the demoralized Panthers. Fourth quar-
ter to-uchdaowns included a 26 yard pitohmlt-run)
to fullback Rich Johnson, a 78 yard punt return
by Dave Jackson, and an" 11 yard rollout by sub-
stitute quarrterback Bob Bess.

West Virginia varsity Coach Jim Carlen believes he has
recruited one of WVU’s best freshmen teams ever, but Sat-
urday night at Ambridge High School Stadium the Little
Mountaineers were trounced by the Panther Cubs, 36-2'.
“We played a fair game,” said freshman football coach Dar-
rell Lewis modestly after the game. “My offense played much bet-
ter than my defense."

Lloyd Weston: “The Name
  This Team is ‘Pride’ ’ ’

4  -. by MIKE BROURMAN

The offense was exceptional
throughout the game -as the
Cubs piled up scores in each
quarter. They used both passing
and running to do it.

In the first quarter, 220-pound
fullback Tony Esposito ran up
the middle for two yards and a.
touchdown to cap a short, two-
play march into the end zone. A
2] yard pass from quarterback
Don Plusquellic to split end Bill
Pilconis set up the score. Plus-
quellic, who hails from Akron,
Ohio, then rolled to the right
side and ﬁnally ran over the
goal line for a two-point con-
version.

In the second quarter, Esposi-
to capped an 85 yard march by
diving over the West Virginia
line for a one yard touchdgwn
plunge. Joe Spicko kicked the
extra point.

A 19 yard touchdown pass
from Plusquellic to Pilconis, and
Spicko’s point after kick, made
the score 22-2 in the third quar-
ter.

In the ﬁnal quarter, the Cubs
scored twice. With 9:30 left in
the game, Plusquellic rolled to
his left, reversed his ﬁeld, and
scrambled 11 yards for the first
score. With ﬁve seconds remain-
ing on the clock, second-string
quarterback Mike Bannon com-
pleted a 37 yard touchdown pass
to J. D. Lewis. Bannon then hit
tight end Bob Jouret in the end
zone for a two-point conversion.

Although the defense he-ld
West Virginia scoreless, coach
Lewis wasn't satisﬁed.

 

“To tell

you the truth,” he said objec-
tively,” our defense was terrible
in the ﬁrst half.”

In the first -half, tailback Bob
Gresham led the West Virginia
ground attack with 49 of the
(‘2 yards that the Little Moun-
tainecrs gained. Buit Lewis
switched his defense in the ﬁ-
nal half; he moved linebacker
Lloyd Weston up on the line on
first downs. It worked. Gresham
was held to 21 yards, as West
Virginia was held to 35 yards
rushing in all.

“We won't change our de-
fense for the next game,” ex-
plained Lewis, “We’ll just have
to practice more.”

ed to overlook the Cub pass do

and Ralph Cindrich each had an
interception.

Overall, the Cubs gave the
near capacity crowd of 7,000
people a fine performance.
“We’re good,” says Weston, “and
so was West Virginia. But we’re
better. Like I said, we're good,

real good.” _

Ten blue-clad gridders lined up along the forty yard
line. Nine of them started straight ahead. The tenth, Lloyd
Weston, surveyed the situation. When everything was to
his satisfaction, he gave the signal. Joe Spicko kicked off, and the
rout of the West Virginia freshman began.

Lloyd Weston was listed on the program as a linebacker, but

he was also the Cubs unofficial
head cheerleader. No one could
make a key tackle without there-
upon receiving a pat on the
back from Lloyd. No one could
throw a good block without im-
mediately afterwards receiving
an encouraging shout from
Lloyd.

“If a guy makes a good tac-
kle,” explains Lloyd, “help him
up, pat him on the back, and
tell -him about it. He deserves
it.”

After a play had ended, Lloyd’s
voice was audible exhorting his
teammates to “Run back to the
huddle!”

“As long as you keep the boys
up,” he explains, “they’ll never
let you down. But, all you have
to do is have one guy lacking
and it hurts the team. If one
guy starts walking, the others
see him and they start walk-
ing." Nobody walked Saturday
night.

Lloyd was delighted with the
outcome of the game, but he
was never worried about it. “I
know what type of talent we
have. We ‘have that desire to
win; we want to win so bad. I
was sure about us. All we had
to do was show the public."

   

“We Want to change the tradi-

    

tion around here, the type of
football played here the last

few years. We got together and .

gave ourselves, this team, a
name. The name is Pride.”

“People laugh at us now, but
watch in a coruple years. We'll
V be like Notre
 Dame. Every-
 body will want
‘ to come here
They'll be

the doors."
As for the
game itself,
Lloyd had noth-
WESTON ing but praised
for the offense. “Our offense
pulled us through,” he said.

“They were better than the de-
fense. They weren't expected to
do as Well, but «they did.”

The defense did, -however,
shut the Little Moutaineers out.
Lloyd was one of three line-
backers, along with Ralph Cind-
rich and John Wozniak, who be-
lieves it is a crime not to be in
on a tackle. Time after time,
WVU ball carriers were buried
under a sea otblue shirts.

Michigan State’s soccer
team came to Oakmont’s Mu-
nicipal Stadium last Satur-
day to enhance -its national
ranking. They thought the game
 the booters would be easy.

Instead of ﬁnding a pushover

‘team, however, the Spartans
were made to "indulge in -a gruel-
ling defensive struggle. And but
for one freakish incident, the
East Lansing ‘booters never
would have gotten away with
their 1-0 win.

The odd occurrence came with
a m‘inute remaining -in the third
 and i-t resulted in the
only score.

Michigan State was on the at-
tack, and in front of the booters’
goal, there was a wild scramble.
Before any of the 250 specta-
tors knew it, center forward
Trevor Harris kicked the ball
into the lower right hand corner
of the nets, beyond the lunging
goalie Len Harmon.

Sophomore right half Bob
Quinlan almost deﬂected it, but
Harris’ kick was so forceful, it
tbent Quinlan’:-s leg at the knee
joint and drove it rinrto his back.

GOALIE GRAB. Len Harmon played one of his ﬁnest games in

the nets although the booters lost to national ranking Michigan

State, 1-0, Saturday. Harmon made 22 saves, continuously avert-
ing Spartan goals.

 

I-I-armon, who had his ﬁnest
day in the goal with 22 saves,
never had a chance to stop it.
“Our ‘guys were trying to ﬁght
it out of there. Someone was on
the ground, and I couldn't see
the ball. Then a player screen-
ed, and I never saw it coming,”
he said, shaking his head.

“But we never gave up out
there today, and I’m just proud
to be with this team,” voiced
Harmon.

Tan and lean, Harrnon sym-
bolized the boot-ers’ determined
effort to upset the ‘Spartans.
Time and again, he thwarted at-
tacks with leaping catches. Once

on a line between ﬁve players.
I-larmon batted it away with his
two ﬁsts, but the Monongahela
boy said, “That was the best
shot I've ever seen.”

For 65 minutes, the soccermen
played the Spartans even. But
in that fourth quarter, although
there was no scoring, MSU’s
depth began to take its toll.

For the first half, Bernis’ “wing

and swing” game plan worked.
“We wanted to turn them around,
using cross passing and it work-
ed ﬁne in the first h ,” said
Bemis.

The game plan didn't work in
the second half for several rea-
-sons. “We had a couple of fel-
lows hurt in that fourth period
and we weren’t able to follow
through with our bench,” ex-
plained Bemis. “But with Michi-
gan State, you don’t notice the
difference when their starters
are out.

With a lackluster offense that
hasn’t scored in three games,
Bemis used a prevent defense
against MSU’s high scoring for-
wards. He stationed center half
Dave Shimpeno as a rover.
Shimpeno always dropped back
on defense when the Saprtans
crossed midﬁeld.

In the first half, it worked
because Michigan State held the
ball too much and «didn't get the
good shots.

In the second half, everytime
the Spartan forward-s got with-
in the 20, they usually got a
shot. In the statistics, MSU led
in corner kicks, 5-1, and their
goalie Joe Baum was credited
with eight saves although the
boaters actually had only one
good shot all afternoon.

eliminate the mistakes they
made against Frostburg. “We
couldn't stop the long kick with
our 4-3-3 defense, and that was
how Frostburg beat us,” com-
mented Snyder. “We may have
to sacriﬁce some down-the-mid-
dle strength with the W-forma-
tion,” he continued, “but Slip»-

pery Rock plays a kicking game fl

and doesn’t use the center of
the ﬁeld too much.”

The fro-sh also expect to be
improved in their teamwork.
“They were playing together for
the ﬁrs-t time in the opener,”
said Snyder, “and the defense
got careless in the second half.
But the ‘boys have been work-
ing more smoothly in practice.”

 

“F latbush’ ’ Shot Down

“Hawk” Flies Into Lead ‘A’

“It was my finest hour. I was absolutely brilliant.”
With these modest words, Mike “Hawk” Brourman summed
up his 10-5 record in this week’s Yogi contest; a mark that

moved him into ﬁrst place.

In a week ﬁlled with major upsets, the “Hawk” used his picks
of underdogs, Rice, North Carolina State, South Carolina, and USC,

to jump to the top.

Right behind the “Hawk” af-
ter his second 9-6 week was
George “Mou-stachio” Lies. “It
was,” said the “Moustache” mod-
estly, “just a small sample of
my amazing psychic powers,”
when explaining his choice of
Texas Tech as well as USC and
South Carolina. Unfortunately,

_his psychic powers conked out

on six contests.

In a desperate bid to escape
gast place, Jay “Flatbush” Rps-
enstein chose this week’s girl,
full of conﬁdence that she would
have a terrible week. His choice,
Amy Bossek, came through wlth
a 4-11 mark.

  Distancemen Score
Runaway Victories

by ART ROSENGARTEN
The varsity and freshman distance teams hope to con-
tinue their winning ways tomorrow afternoon when they
face the harriers of Cleveland State at 4 p.m. on the Schen-

ley park course.

In Saturday’s meet, the varsity and freshman squads had a
“perfect” day as they defeated New York State College at Buffalo

by idential scores of 15-50. _

Before the meet, the New York
coach told coach Jim Banner
that he had some pretty good

‘boys in both his varsity and

7}

freshmen teams and that he ex-
pected his squads to give Ban-
nerls harriers a good ﬁght. As
it turned out, the close ﬁght
never I materialized.

“Maybe it was the Schenley
Park hills or the course itself,
but they (New York State) nev-
er seemed to offer any competi-
tion for the boys,” said Banner.
“Running at home certainly was
an aid to us,” he added.

Banner felt that the distance-
men did a pretty good job, but
there is still plenty of room for
rirnzprovemenlt for -both squads.
“The varsity should be -running
faster and the freshmen should
be closing the time gap between
the ﬁrst and seventh men,” he
explained.

The number one man for the
varsity this week was senior

Two games were on Fri-
day’s fraternity softball
schedule, with only one being
played. In the ‘second game, Phi
Gamma Delta was forced to for-
feit to Kappa Sigma because
only eight of Phi Gamma Del-
ta’.s players were on the ﬁeld.

In the game -that was played,
Theta Chi defeated Lambda Sig-
ma Rho, 7-4. Theta Chi had com-
mand throughoult the game,
holding «a 7-0 lead going into
the sixth inn'in~g.

of their runs in ithe sixth inn-
inig, paced by two triples off the
bats of Rich Tidwell and Ran-
dy N ornis.

Theta Chi’/s win was gained
by Terry Michaels’ ﬁne pitch-
