Pitt homecoming candidate disqualified

By Christine Hanna
Editor in Chief

A homecoming queen candidate was
disqualified by Pitt Program Council
after a second campaigning violation
Monday.

“I witnessed two [of candidate Kelly
Frey’s] campaigners cross the 1ine.[at the
Towers] to a group of three men; one of
the women handed [a lollipop] over,”
said Leslie Tullio, PPC’s executive board
director.

According to PPC, distribution and the
hanging of campaign materials must be

50 feet from the voting poll, and if this is
violated the candidate will be disquali-
fied. Grey duct tape outlines the bound-
ary, said Tom Misuraca, assistant director
for student activities.

Tullio said it is the candidate’s job to
educate all campaigners about the rules
beforehand. '

Stacey Herreid, Frey’s sorority sister
and campaigner, said Jen Pron, a pledge,
walked over to say “hi” to her boyfriend
as they were walking to the stairs outside
o_f Towers since a class was letting o.ut
around 3:40 p.m., 20 minutes before the
polls closed. Herreid went across the line

to ask Pron if she should be that close
when Tullio came out of the Towers
lobby.

Pron disagreed about the exchange of
the lollipop by saying that a friend of her
boyfriend took the campaign lollipop out
of her basket and that therewas nothing
she could do.

“Neither of us were campaigning,”
Pron said. “We saw a lot of other [cam-
paigners crossing the line] most of the
day.” .

Tullio said it was an exchange of mate-
rials; the materials should not -have

A strong leader who led by example.

A father ﬁgure who was a calming inﬂuence

on the young officers.

This is what people have said of Walt Waters,
the assistant director of Public Safety who retired
last month. Waters joined Public Safety in 1969
as a patrolman and worked for 25 years, including

three stints as interim director.

Waters’ inﬂuence on the department is recog-
nized by many of his co-workers. Assistant direc-
tor Gary Moses worked with Waters for over 18

years.

“Wa1t had a quality of showing good leader-
ship,” Moses said. “He was very loyal to the

department and to the university.”

Public Safety Captain Tim Delaney praised
Waters’ ability to communicate with everyone

around him.

“He always saw the good side of everybody. He
was a bridge between the old and the new,”

There will be a period of

you can apply to this commis-

murdered someone, if you’ve
abducted someone’s child, you
can apply to this commission

said.

But, in order to get amnesty,
the crime must have been polit-

must be disclosed and propor-

SEAC scans local forest to

By Chris Lombardo
For The Pitt News

The Student Environment Action
Coalition completed its mapping of
the Allegheny National Forest last

weekend, closing the first phase of the ~

Allegheny Defense Project.

The project —— sponsored by SEAC
of Pitt, other groups from region 13
and in conjunction with Preserve
Appalachian Wilderness — was creat-
ed to combat the future logging of the
ANF.

The ANF, located primarily in
Warren County, is a 510,000 acre for-
est managed by the iU.S. Forest
Service. In the past few years, the
USFS has expressed interest in a par-
ticular part of the ANF named the
Sockeye area, and members of SEAC
are concerned it will become part of
the 70,000 acres of trees cut on feder-
al land each year. For the past 20
years, the USFS has spent 35 percent
of its budget on the timber program
and only 2 percent on recreation,

wildlife and soil management.

The mapping project involved a
scan of the Sockeye area to determine
and document the environmental
makeup of certain areas of that region.

The reason SEAC sought to “map”
the area is to gain information
to be used in the defense of
the region when the time
comes to combat the
USFS against the
deforestation of the
Sockeye region.

“We know that in
the near future, that
particular area is
scheduled for tree

Newsletters from the
USFS have told us. They
are required to inform the
public of their future pro-
jects,” said SEAC member Matt
Peters.

consider the comments of citizens

land, a requirement that doesn’t
always get fulfilled, according to
Peters.

In order to find out what the USFS
is up to, you must be on the mailing
list for their quarterly newsletters, be
living in a forest region con-
trolled by the government
or be willing to contact
the service on a fre-
quent basis. But infor-
mation is available to
anyone who wants it.

P e t e r s
explained that by
becoming familiar
with the Sockeye
area, it will be easy to"
point out environmen-
tal violations that will
occur if the area is logged.
He said he believes several
violations exist in every acre of
that region, and the breaking of feder-

al laws such as the Endangered

Species Act and Wetlands Protection
Act is inevitable. ANF is home to over

300 species of mammals and hundreds
of birds, including bald eagles.

In past trips to the ANF, SEAC
members said, they have spotted areas
that already have fallen victim to the
timber industry.

Many of these areas are stripped of
most trees except black cherry trees.
These trees, according to Peters, will
remain and be joined by newly plant-
ed black cherry trees, then eventually
cut down. Black cherry is ’a popular
and profitable wood that is commonly
used for furniture.

The population of black cherry trees
has grown from 4 to 60 percent of the
total tree population in the ANF, while
other trees like oaks and hemlocks
have seen their numbers cut by over
half in the past few decades.
Removing all species of trees except
one from a particular region will
destroy the ecological balance of that
area, and the chances for recovery are
minimal.

Attempts to reach the USFS were
unsuccessful.

Boyd

°From page I

after getting that job, he was drafted
into the U.S. Army.

“I was trained as Military Police
officer and then I was a drug coun-
selor in the army prison system,”
Boyd said.

After his stint with the Army, Boyd
began his rise in Michigan law
enforcement. He worked as a patrol
officer at MSU from 1972 to 1976.
When he'wasn’t patrolling the cam-
pus, he was busy taking classes to get
his degree, a bachelor’s degree in
police administration and a master’s
degree from the MSU School of
Criminal Justice.

Along with his Army training and
textbook education, Boyd took cours-
es with the Federal Bureau of
Investigation in Quantico, Virginia,
and was trained by the Drug
Enforcement Agency. ‘

“I had some specialized training
from the DEA,” said Boyd. “We
worked on a series of undercover
drug investigations for about four

9

 

years.”

According to Boyd, the investiga-
tions centered around the East
Lansing area, but they did pursue
suspects throughout the United
States.

“We were seeking to take this as
high as we could get it,” Boyd said.

Taking things as high as they could
go is one of Boyd’s most impressive
qualities, according to Jill Pierce,
Boyd’s secretary while he was an
undersheriff for the Ingham County
Office of Sheriff.

“He is very dedicated,” Pierce said.
“He’s the kind of guy "who keeps
working until the job gets done.”

One job that Boyd had where he
got outstanding results was his tenure
as a police lieutenant at MSU from
1985 to 1988.

“I was in charge of drawing up a
community policing plan at Michigan
State,” Boyd said. “We took officers
out of patrol cars and told them they
would set up offices inside dormito-
r1es.”

The officers developed a
personable relationship with the
students, which had a dramatic
effect on the crime rate, according to

Boyd. -

“I felt real good about that pro— -

gram. It had its intended effect as far
as building trust and cooperation
between the students and the police,”
Boyd said.

Boyd said he intends to look into
the possibility of designing a similar
program for the dorms at Pitt.

One idea Boyd has underway is a
guarantee to sexual assault victims.

“I don’t want anyone to not report
an incident because of a fear that it
will not be dealt with properly,” he
said.

Dealing with issues suchas sexual
assault or student drinking is impor-
tant enough to Boyd that he has
decided to take classes in
Pennsylvania to learn about the law.

“I have applied to take classes at
the Pennsylvania Police Academy to
learn Pennsylvania law so I can

cer in the state,” Boyd said.

He might have to work hard to get
adjusted to the law in Pittsburgh, but
according to his new co-workers, the
adjustment of moving into his new
position was easy. I

“There was no adjustment,” said
Public Safety Capt. Tim Delaney.
“He has the ability to watch and see
how things are done, and he under-
stands the university background
which really supports us.”

John Devitto, associate vice chan-
cellor for business and affairs, agrees
with Delaney. ‘

“[Boyd] has fit in extremely well.
He has already faced tough issues,
and he is not afraid to make deci-
sions,” Devitto said.

Boyd said he is honored to be here,
and he is looking forward to the chal-
lenges that lie ahead.

“I love the blend of the university
and the city at Pitt,” Boyd said.
“Pittsburgh is the friendliest city I’ve
ever been in.”

Villa-Vicencio questioned
whether a situation could be
created in which the victims of
gross human rights violations
are somehow compensated for
what they have been through.

To find a solution, a
Commission of Reparation has
been purposed. The objective is
to create a society in which the
people know that the human
rights violations will never hap-
pen again.

The purposed bill requires
that most of the work be done
within 18 months.

Waters

°From page 1
Delaney said.
. Associate Vice Chancellor
for Business and Finance John

Devitto, was happy Waters ,

worked at Pitt’s Public Safety
department.

“His service was invaluable.
The university has changed
over the years, and so has the
Public Safety department. It is
now the third-largest police

department in Allegheny

County,” Devitto said.

The department was not as
big when Waters took his first
assignment as a patrol officer in
the Salk Hall area. He joined
campus police because of the
different functions the job
offered.

“It seemed like there would

I be a lot of opportunities and it

seemed like an interesting jo ,”
Waters said.

Waters enjoyed his responsi-
bilities as a patrolman and he
said sometimes the job of a
beat cop gets overlooked.

“The patrolman is the back-
bone of the organization,” he
said.

Waters said he was promoted
to sergeant after a few years as
a patrol officer, and a few years
after that he was given the posi-
tion of lieutenant. Eventually
Waters took the position of
assistant director. In that role he
served as interim director in
1981, 1988 and from spring
1993 until his retirement.

When he took over the force
for the third time, he said that
morale was down and he

’ worked hard on fixing it.

“I think when the morale was
down,I had the ability to stabi-
lize the department and get
headed in the right direction,”
Waters said.

Moses said Waters’ most
recent stop as interim director

was important for the’ depart-

ment. . , ,
“Walt projected a real posi-

tive image in the university,”

Moses said.

Waters said the department is
still headed in the right direc-
tion with Rick Boyd in charge.

“Eight years ago University
of Pittsburgh had one of the
best police departments in the
country. Rick Boyd will contin-
ue to keep it moving in a pro-

gressive, forward direction,”

Waters said.

Waters said that for the
department to keep improving,
the supervisors’ confidence
must be kept up, and security
and safety seminars must
remain a priority. p j

“You have to keep reaching
out to the university communi-
ty with seminars on safety and
security,” Waters said.

Waters said he would like to
sit back and relax now that he
is retired, but he has two pro-
jects that are keeping him busy.

“I have a little place in
Bedford that I am ‘trying to get
ready for the winter, but I've
been kept busy getting my visa
and passport for my Semester
at Sea trip in January, where I
will be a security officer,” he
said.

He added thatin the long.

term he might continue to work
in the security field because he
misses the job.

“I really liked interacting
with the people,” he said.
“There were good times and
bad times, more good times,
but it was never dull.”

crossed the line. She also said
there were no other problems
that PPC was made aware of
and that it received no com-
plaints.

According to Frey, after
Tullio saw the campaigners
within the the circle, they
went back to discuss it in the
middle of the Towers lobby
since it was her second viola-
tion.

Frey’s first
occurred around 11 a.m.
when one of her campaigners
was found campaigning
inside. She was told that if
nothing else happened it
would be let go.

“We gave her a break on
the first violation,” said
Misuraca.

Frey said she then told all
of her campaigners to be sure
to stick with the rules.

She said that disqualifica-
tion for the exchange of a
Dum—Dum lollipop between a
girlfriend and boyfriendis
wrong.

“I think it is completely
absurd and ridiculous. It
wasn’t intentional.” said
Herreid.

“As far as the whole situa-
tion is concerned. it is very
unfortunate. However, the
rules are the rules. It’s the
only way to ensure everyone
a fair shake,” said Tullio.

“It’s like a bomb being
dropped,” Frey said. “I repre-
sent different organizations. 
feel like everyone who put in
any type of effort was cheat-
ed.” 

Frey said she just wanted
the chance to represent the
people who turned out and
supported her. She said, how-
ever, that she respects
Tullio’s position.

“Hundreds of dollars were
spent by the sorority and
myself. My name and reputa-
tion is on the line.”

During the past few years,
there have been other contro-
versies over homecoming
king and queen elections.

“I don’t know where
[homecoming king and queen
elections] is going from
here,” Misuraca said.

He said it’s hard to get vol-
unteers for the polls, and
there have been various
changes in the selection
process. “If we continue to do
this, are we going to have to
hire police [to insure that
campaigners don’t cross the
lines]?” Misuraca said.

Students selected to the
court are: Alison Ballesteros.
Emily Bush, Laurie Eslinger,
Cameron Head, Elizabeth
Mania, Frank LeDonne, Gary
Mule, George Ogilvie, Brian
Parker and Greg Simunick.

All THE HYPE AND ALL THE MUSIC EROM NYC'S CMJ MUSIC MARATHON '94 ARTICLE AND PHOTOGRAPHS BY JESSE TRBOVICH

THE HYPE

Every year the College Music Journal
throws a big music seminar in New
York City that showcases their version
of what’s hip in the indie college rock
world. I went up to the convention as
part of a team with WPTS directors to
observe and partake in the festivities.
Equipped with a University minivan, we
put the pedal to the metal and made
our way to the Big Apple. With over
300 bands to see, we collectively
drooled thinking of all the shows we
would be "enjoying. An enthusiastic
mood pervaded the trip. The new fresh
flavor was in our ears, and when we
reached Manhattan we charged. First
on our minds was getting registered in
the seminar’s headquarters, the Hilton.
Second was getting to our hotel and
relaxing before an evening of live
entertainment. The team was less than
prepared for what actually transpired.

Registering was not a problem. After
standing in line for 10 minutes, I sub-
mitted my check registration card in
return for a name tag and directions to
a conference room for a “survival”
packet. During this time I paid close
attention to the others registering
around me. It seemed like everyone
either had a Rev. Horton Heat shirt or
were dressed in a thrift store Uni-Mart
outfit. They all were carrying the sur-
vival bags, leafing through the compli-
mentary copy of Rolling Stone. The
bags were filled with compilation CDs
from various labels, some mainstream
magazines such as Alternative Press
and CMJ. The bag was filled to the
brim with this type of promotional stuff;
l got tired of carrying it. This promotion-
al barrage was as subtle as a Mack
Truck driving through your living room.
Every magazine had buzzwords like
“slacker” or “indie” and featured col-
laged images and irregular-type faces.
I didn’t expect to deal with blatant
attempts to sell products andimages.
don’t think for a minute that CMJ is a
vacuum in which one can justify ani-
mosity towards the big music industry
by supporting “do-it-your-self-ers” and
making contacts with people who
shunned established labels and con-

ventions. lt’s a convenient way for 

some record executive to sell his com-
modity and remind kids what words to
use, what music to buy and how to
dress. Give me shelter from, this storm!
The real headache was yet to come as
we went toward our hotel.

I guess we all knew what was hap-
pening when two team members
whose names were used to reserve the
room came back scowling. We were
without a room; our reservations were

tools, and how the Internet made their
jobs easier. They encouraged all to use
the lnternet/E-mail and contribute our
own brilliant ideas, stories, data, etc.

 We were reminded to check out the

record lists, indicating what’s new and
cool to listen to, and of course pur-
chase, via computer. We weren’t to for-
get that concert tickets could be pur-
chased through the system and that
tour schedules of bands would be con-
veniently posted. It doesn’t take
Sherlock Holmes to figure out that E-
mail is a powerful tool that is used to
hype a band and sell its records and
concerts. Who benefits? Label execu-
tives. There are “free” aspects of the
Internet now — compuzines and bul-
letin boards — but wait until the rest of
the nation is hooked up to this powerful

, _. drug. A price will be set and eventually

cancelled and issued to some other  _ "1 .

party. It turned out that no one at Pitt ft’
reconfirmed our reservations;damn 
those beareaucrats. it would have 
taken one phone call, but instead it 

took us three hours of walking and dri-
ving to discover that there were no
rooms available in Manhattan, period.
Luckily we knew someone who lived in
the city and were put up for the night.
Feeling displaced and starved, we
went out to eat. We got some pizza
and then something miraculous hap-
pened: in walked theThe Iron Sheik,
pointy boots and all. The finer details of
the “Camel Clutch” were discussed
while finished. One of the PTS DJs

went to get his autograph, only to be
smothered by adoring wrestling fans
that had come off the streets.

The next morning Pitt had got us a
room, so we checked in. Oh to be out
of the downpour! This feeling was only
temporary. After freshening up, we hit
the headquarters of the seminar, the
Hilton. During the day there's a wide
variety of “provocative” and “education-
al” panel discussions being held in the

various conference rooms. The team’s
collective response to the discussions
was “Who give’s "a fuck?” We were still
pretty tired and stiff and could care less
about the “celebrity” panels. We did
attend one, but predominantly for the
ice water. It addressed the ever popu-
lar E-mail phenomenon. A panel of
some industry representative, a maga-
zine representative and a musician all
described how computers are useful

 increased. lt’s just like record collect-

ing. Bands would put out music on 7”
and few interested kids would buy it
cheaply. They get picked up by an
indie label, and now the 7” can cost an
average of $4, and the price of the old
records skyrockets due to collectibility.
indie labels are being supported with
major label money and are profit
machines just like any business. They
need your dollars, and the use of com-
puters is just another clever promotion-
al pitch as obnoxious as the free “sur-
vival guide” they shoved in our hands.
Would this deluge ever stop? The real
backbone of CMJ, E-Mail--addicted
slackers and record labels is music. Or
is it money?

THE MUSIC

A When we finally saw a show, all the
hassles seemed worth it. That same
room that housed the E-Mail discus-
sion offered a diamond in the rough -
Versus. I had written them off as just
another Teen Beat band that was prob-
ably OK but nothing special; I was
wrong. The vocals, bass, guitar and
drums blended into a harmonious dis-
play of pop mastery. The trio really
seemed to listen to each other. No sin-
gle element was overpowering, which
made even the subtlest chord change
seem dynamic and powerful. All the
team could do was sigh. Mark Eitzel
tuned his guitar while Versus disman-
tled their equipment. The American
Music Club leader spilled his guts and
left the crowd speechless. He wasn’t
the ultra—moody troubadour that I
expected. in fact, he was quite person-
able and witty, cracking jokes about
himself and graciously accepting huge
amounts of applause. He played vari-
ous AMC favorites, stripping them to
their bare essentials. His lone acoustic
guitar accompaniment and soaring
voice were enough to give everyone
chills. After eating dinner, part of the
team returned to the very same room
to watch Germany’s marriage of
melody and noise, 18th Dye. This
band was the most exciting group we
saw. The bassist switched from driving
melodies to brooding dissonant chords,
while the drummer slammed the hell
out of a three-piece set. The singer/gui-
tarist was a cross between Lee Rinaldo
of Sonic Youth and Peter Buck of
REM. He accompanied his vocals
extremely well and rose on occasion to

The Adventures of Priscilla:
Queen of the Desert

Written and Directed by
Stephan Elliott

Starring Terence Stamp, Hugo
Weaving and Guy Pearce

Shakin’ it a la Rupaul,
groovin’ like Grease, gettin’
down with the Village People
(oh, oww!) and donning the
best drag since The Rocky
Horror Picture Show, in all of
its indulgence Priscilla isn’t
much more than a swank fash-
ion show — but nonetheless, a
very good one. While some-
times less than a narrative —
frequently supplanting plot
with dance numbers and
panaromic awe of the Aussie
outback, the film is structured
in the well-established road
trip formula. Beckoning the
epic journey, Priscilla tells a
rather conventional story of
three transvestites who bond,
bicker, bitchand re-bond by
the film’s finish.

What is watchable about
Priscilla is not its underdevel-
oped structure (one plus two
minus fortune and an engine
failure equals destination, res-.
olution and conclusion), but
rather its comical characters,
catty dialogue, exaggerated
mannerisms and vivid scenes.

The story centers on a
three-member, cross-dressing
cabaret act which travels in
Priscilla, a pink bus, from
Sydney to a resort in the mid-
dle of stark Australia. The
aged transsexual Bernadette
(Terence Stamp); the ponder-
ous, ABBA-loving, thirtysome-
thing divorcee Tick/Mitzy
(Hugo Weaving) and the
young, flirtatious Adam/Felicia
(Guy Pearce) comprise a core
of believably human and lik-
able characters. They ain’t
meat and potatoes men;
Bernadette, Mitzy and Felicia
know this. They’re gaudy
champions of individuality —-
starving artists. They’re glitzy
aliens in a dull land, and they
love it. '
While en route to the resort,
the happy-go-lucky gang
maintains a confident attitude,
frequently breaking into song
and dance in the midst of
homophobia and beer-swilling
intolerance. When these
nightlife dolls come in contact
with Aussie local yokels, the
effect is often used to give
simplified, “fish out of water”
comedy and drama. Of
course, Priscilla includes con-
frontation with bigoted proles:
Bernadette, first wearing a
costume made of flip flops

(HA!), saves the crew at the
first bar by outdrinking a bitch-
regular, thereby converting the
entire bar into lovable yuks,
who then admire the darling
trio.

The scenes utilizing cross-
cultural exploration would
have been appropriate had
Elliot pushed them further.
Obviously, urban drag stands
in opposition to rural mores
and standards (much of the
plot is driven by such interac-
tion), but a more compelling
story could have been told
without relying" on the formula-
ic, “us-versus-them” fable.
Being a comedy at a base
level, Priscilla absolves itself
of such responsibility; this is
fine, except that Elliot also
wants to have the privilege of

commenting on a prejudiced
society. A romance develops
between Bernadette and a
fourth character, Bob, but the
slick script pussy-foots around
Bob and Bernadette’s sexuali-
ty with the same trepidation of
junior high dances. Like oil
and water, social commentary
and comedy don’t mix in
Prisiclla. But, damn, you wish
Elliot would have tried harder
and putforth something more
than a half-assed, Phildelphia-
esque flick made palatable for
matinee, high-brow audiences.

Revamping the good ole
Hollywood musical with a
superabundance of staged
numbers and a sound track
comprised of doo-wop dance,
70s glam and disco, Priscilla
lets loose a fitful of interesting

OCTOBER 13 1994

  
 

showmanship. One of the
film’s best sequences comes
with a montage near the con-
clusion which tightly encapsu-
lates the film’s most basic,
good-time intentions and its
light-hearted tone. While at the
resort, Bernadette, Mitzy and
Felicia put on show after
dance show, sporting a full
array of bright, vivid costumes,
contorted hairstyles and lavish
make-up. This over-the-top
plumage, dance and dress
comprise the drag-o-rama’s
core. And it's this glamorous
fuel that makes Priscilla pic-
turesque entertainment.
Priscilla opens Friday
October 14 at the Fulton,
downtown. Call 471-9700.

13 million adults and over one million children are
HIV positive. Unbelievable? Definitely.
l’m citing this because it’s relevant to everyone’s
life and to Pitt’s production of Jeffrey which opened
last night. Jeffrey is a romantic comedy about homo-
sexual dating in our HIV infested society. Jeffrey
decides to give up sex and love in a world where
‘things are just — not what they should be. Sex is too
sacred to be treated this way. Sex wasn't meant to
 be safe, or negotiated, or fatal.” These lines begin
Jeffrey’s confusion about our everyday world and
ends in his decision to give up sex and love. '
This might sound a little somber, but Paul Rudnick
-has placed these very sobering issues in his rich,
comedic style. Jeffrey is by far one of the funniest
AIDS plays ever to hit the theatre.
‘I wanted to capture the insanity of the AIDS era
and the valor of those who manage to find love and
double-ply cashmere between, and even during, hos-
 pital visits, marches and eulogies,” Rudnick wrote in
his intro to Jeffrey.
DAD (to MOM): Eileen, Jeff’s stopped having sex.
MOM (concerned): Let me get on the other line.
(She picks up an extension.) No sex? You mean just
safe sex, don’t you, dear?
JEFFREY: No, Mom, I hate safe sex.
DAD: Wrestling with those condoms.
MOM: Water-based lubricants.
Those lines, from Jeffrey, have an interesting way
of dealing with these grave issues in a captivating
way. ‘

Rich Keitel is directing the nine-member cast, eight
of whom are straight. I read another preview on this
particular production which doubted the authenticity I

of the straight actors portraying gay men.

Both Keitel and I agreed that that is the magic of
theatre. The actor's job is to portray honestly the life
of ANY character. Perhaps that writer doubted the
honesty of straight men understanding and portray-
ing a gay man’s life. But not all theater is always per-
formed well. Last night's performance was almost
sold out, so it sounds like Pitt’s cast is doing awe-
some work.

The cast and Keitel (who directed Six Degrees of
Separation) are anxious to share this wonderful show
along with the show’s dramaturg, Ted Hoover
(“Pittsburgh’s professional homosexual,” he called
himself).

“lt’s perfect for a university setting,” nodded Keitel.
“The prospect of sexually transmitted diseases and
AIDS should be forefront in students’ minds.”

I unequivocally agree with Rich. In my opinion,
AIDS and STDs have raised “generation X." Thy’re
all I have ever known, all I have ever heard about
growing up. Unless we want to wipe out the entire
population, we cannot ignore them because that only
breeds them.

“The play ranges from outside Blockbuster Video to
the Empire State Building to a masturbation club.
You get over 30 locations for the price of one ticket,”
laughed Keitel.

Jeffrey runs through Oct. 20 with Saturday and
Sunday matinees. Show times are 8 p.m. for evening
and 2 p.m. for matinee performances. The show is
running at the Stephen Foster Theatre located on
Forbes, next to Cathedral.

Tickets are going fast, so call the box office at 624-
PLAY. There will be audience discussions following
most performances.

They seem as if they are an
entirely different breed of
humans. They have their own
uniform style, their own unique
language, but above all they
each share one thing in com-
mon: a complete dedication to
the art of dance. To watch
them glide across the floor is
to witness the music come
alive. Welcome to the world of
the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre.
The company has been
especially busy lately due to
the upcoming performance of
Swan Lake. This timeless bal-
let marks the theatre’s twenty-
fifth anniversary season.
Artistic Director Patricia
Wilde, a magnificent former
principal dancer with the New
York City Ballet, has been at
work trying to prepare the
company for the opening per-

formance Thursday night.

Since Wilde became director
in 1982, the PBT has achieved
a new level of artistry and pro-
fessionalism. In addition to the

 

 N S‘-:-._. 3' V‘
.. {é§>.'¢==’::’-“E 

local and national successes
of the PBT under her leader-
ship, Wilde has expanded the
repertoire of the company to
include contemporary ballets
as well as established master-
pieces such as Swan Lake.

Remarkably, when originally
offered the directorship, Wilde
was a bit hesitant to accept it.
The dancers themselves
changed her mind. “l had
always been interested in the
students, watching them
progress, and seeing the peo-
ple l was working with become
soloists and principals.”

Wilde stated that the great-
est reward for her at PBT was
being able to grow with the
dancers. Therefore, one of the
most exciting aspects of her
career has been selecting the
performers who will be fea-
tured in the starring roles.

For Swan Lake, the compa-
ny needed a Swan Queen who
was both versatile and an
accomplished classical balleri-

na. Enter Nanci Crowley.
Crowley became a member of
the PBT in 1987 and was pro-
moted to soloist in 1992. This
season, Nanci will be making
her principal debut as the
enchanting Odette/Odile on
Friday’s performance. “This is
a very exciting time for me,
[but] I'm trying not so much to
think about [the debut] as
much as the work and the bal-
let.”

Although opening night is
drawing near, Nanci and the
other performers seem to be
almost entirely unshaken.
Perhaps this is because they
know that on Thursday
evening when the spotlights go
up, all of the hard work and
devotion become well worth
the effort.

Swan Lake opens at the
Benedum tonight at 7:30 p.m.
and runs throughout the week-
end. For tickets and times, call

Dayton '5 Silver Stars

- Last Friday, my girlfriend and I charged
a full-tank of gas and headed to Cleveland,
to see  My  Misinformed, we
prematurely got to the Euclid Tavern two
hours before the show. The bar hinted of
a rich man's game room; the heads of

exotic animals was the decoration. The beer
was cheap and cold. Pitchers were served
in 64oz. juice glass bottles.What's the deal?
A bartender defended, "People were steal-

» ing our ptichers." We sat and order

laTrobe, Pa.'s only beer. As we talked, she
leaned over and whisperd, "Isn't that the

J girl from The ltireedle-rs behind you?" It

wasn't exactly what I thought she was
going to say, but it was still okay in my

book. I took a quick casual peek behind me V

and said, "I think so." I grabbed my beer

and drank a gulp of confidence.

" Hi. Are you Kim or Kelly Deal?"

"I'm Kim."

She put her paper down and shook my
hand. I took another gulp of confidence.

"You came out to see GBV?"

"Wouldn't miss it for the world."

This was so hip.

"I saw you guys at Lollapoolza in West
Virgina. I was watching Stereolab and you
guy came on. So, we forced yourselves to
the main stage."

"Oh yeah, I remember West Virgina."

"Yeah, youguyslonly played for half-

hour." She said,"...yeah."
She went back to the paper. The moral of
the story: Don't complain to rock stars,
you'll get short-changed on your
I5 minutes of fame. Oh Boy!

So about 20' conversation topics later, a
stumbling band took the stage. Robert
Pollard, the singer, screamed "I-2-3-4".
They played some old songs ("Shocker In

GloomTown"), some new songs ("Tractor
Rope Chain"), and some songs I never
heard I ??? ). Early in the set, Robert said
he need some help with "Gold-hearted
Mountain Top Queen Directory" and asked
for Kim Deal for help. The crowd kinda all
said, "Wow." As Kim sang aduet, I
thought, what a Kodak musical moment.
Eventually, the amps were unplugged and
Robert dropped the mic. Was this what the
early Who, Stones, and Beatles were like?
Definately a vibe to watch, because it was
something I born much too late to see.

Monster
R.E.M.
Warner Bros.

R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck
has at times been compared
to legendary Beatle George
Harrison, a comparison which
probably arose from Buck’s
“jang|y,” simple guitar riffs that
dominated so much of the
Athens supergroup’s early
sound.

However, the immortal Fab
Four were not known for their
simplicity, but for their com-
plexity, as characterized by
their constant evolution into
something bigger, better,
more unpredictable.

For some strange reason,
R.E.M. seems to fit into this
category too. Just when you
get used to the pop-soaked
happiness on 1991’s Out of
Time (anyone remember
“Shiny Happy People?”) or the
quiet, desperate melancholy
of ‘92’s Automatic for the
People, R.E.M. puts out its
loudest, hardest-rocking
album to date.

The title “Monster” says
quite a bit about the album
itself — big, shocking, a little
scary at times and loud. And
with very few exceptions,
Monster stands out as
R.E.M.’s best work since the
group finished its Green tour
nearly five years ago.

This is not to say that
Monster is better than the
band’s last two offerings just
because it’s louder. it’s better
because Stipe’s songwriting is
more potent than it’s been
since R.E.M.’s breakthrough
album, the politically-charged
Document. It's better because
the Mike Mills/Bill ,Berry
rhythm section is tighter than
it’s been since l989’s Green.
In short, it’s better because it’s
more like the R.E.M. we grew
to know and love back in the
‘80s.

But that's not such a bad
thing either. Back in the
band's college-radio heyday,
Stipe’s unintelligible, stream-
of-consciousness lyrics were
part of what set the band
apart from the progressive
pack. Stipe’s trademark mum-
bling, which was noticeably
absent on recent offerings,
makes a huge return on
Monster.

And that’s something we
can all be thankful for. After
all, tunes such as “Let Me In’’
(which is recognized as
Stipe’s attempt to contact the

late Kurt Cobain) seem a bit’

more effective when their
lyrics are open to a number of
interpretations.

To call Monstera mere rein-
vention of the wheel would be
a grave injustice, however. it’s
also not all a bunch of noise,
in spite of Buck’s increasing

use of distortion on his guitar
tracks. Upbeat rockers “What’s
the Frequency, Kenneth?” and
“Star 69” are balanced out by
the mellow ballad “Strange
Currencies” and the delicate
“Tongue” (which features a
falsetto Stipe vocal backed by
a rich keyboard arrangement
by Mills and deserves a much
better title).

Stipe also continues to
develop into one of the best
songwriters in popular music,
exploring sexuality further than
ever before on ‘‘I Don’t Sleep, I
Dream” (“am l good in bed 
l’ll settle for a cup of coffee,
but you know what I really
need.”) and conducting an all-
out search for identity in the
distortion-drenched “King of
Comedy” (“Make it charged
with controversy/l’m straight,
l’m queer, l’m bi/l’m not the
king of comedy/l’m not your
magazine/l’m not your televi-
sion”). is Stipe still maturing
and searching for his identity
after 34 years, or is he just
striking at music biz rumor-
mongers who can’t stop won-
dering about his sexual orien-
tation?

The answer to that question
or the thousands of others
Monster raises won’t be found
after listening to the disc just
once. Like the double mean-
ing-drenched early albums
Murmur and Reckoning and
unlike the straightforward, cut-
and-dry recent works, Monster
will get listeners addicted to
Buck’s brilliant guitar work
while they’re trying to figure
out what the hell Stipe is
singing about.

For fans whose first taste of
R.E.M. was 1991’s light and
airy Out of Time, Monster will
show that the band can rock
as hard and loud as anyone
without sounding stupid. For
those of us who’ve followed
Athens’ favorite sons since

their college-radio days,
Monster, in all its simplicity
and complexity, will have us
convinced that R.E.M. is back,
without a doubt

Fun
Daniel Johnston
Atlantic Records

You haven’t heard of Daniel
Johnston? He’s been around a
long time and averages at
least five references to King
Kong, Captain America or
Tarzan on each release.
Johnston hails from Texas
along with Paul Leary, Austin’s
incarnation of brilliance, of the
Butthole Surfers. The music
backing Johnston’s lyrics is
more organized than previous
albums. The complexity is
most likely due to Leary’s pro-
ducing and engineering of the
music. Johnston’s steady
medium of demented love
rears on almost every song,
however, despite the new ele-
ment of Leary’s ideas. 0

The first single on the
record, “|ove wheel”, holds the
honored position of biggest
pop song of the year, with
catchy guitars and a tune to
which you can shimmy around
the living room. His enduring
style of music as catharsis and
simple lyrics done in a childish
sing-song voice control most
of the songs (along with love
and monsters, naturally). One
of the best tracks — they’re all
pretty darn good —_ is “happy
town”, a remembrance of a
better time with a groovy baby-
sitter. He tends to repeat cer-
tain words over and over, such
as holy, ever and fight.
Curious over the context of
those words in a song about a
childhood baby-sitter? I can’t
do justice to the song or the
album through words, so if you
are interested buy the cd.

An interesting aspect that’s
used on this release, as
opposed to earlier ones, is the
musical instruments backing
Johnston’s vocals. String
instruments, heavenly organs
and strong guitars take the
place of the before-favored
keyboards, bells and drums.
The lyrics range from child-
hood stories to, possibly, the
words of a genius who has fig-
ured out that happiness is a
simple thing that most people
don’t open their eyes to see.
The last song, “rock ‘n
roll/ega,” fluctuates between
depressing statements about
personal loneliness and heavy
rock-and—roll moments. The
last verse remains in the rock
and roll genre, and the lyrics
degenerate into incoherencies
about socks and the anti-
christ. Well, at least we learn
this: “My heart looked to art,
and I found the Beatles. Oh
god, I was and still am a true
disciple.”

If you’re still feeling a little
unsure about purchasing the
release, just because you’ve
never heard of him, you can
check a compilation he’s on
called Texas Trip with the
Buttholes and others. The art-
work on the inlay of Fun,
though, is reason enough for
people to run out to their
favorite store and pick up a
copy. Artwork, Daniel
Johnston, monsters and baby-
sitters are all a person really
needs in an album.

Galliano: The Plot Thickens
Galliano
Polygram

Put Arrested Development
and C&C Music Factory in the
same studio and what have
you got? A bunch of crap?
Close, try Galliano. The whole
time i listened to them, I was

balling my fists and pulling out
my hair. I could not wait fbr it
to be over with. “Who are
these sorry excuses for
sound?" you may ask. They
call themselves Galliano. What
they shouldn’t call themselves
is talented. l hate to sound trite
but they suck.

Their latest album Galliano:
The Plot Thickens, is a combo
of wannabe hip-hop,funk,
rock, jazz and r&b, but to no
avail. All of these “diverse”
sounds cancel each other out,
leaving nothing but pestering
tones and screwed-up vocals.
I hate this album!

The first song (if you wanna
call it that), “Was This The
Time,” entails an Englishman
passionately spewing rhetori-
cal verses to the beat of a
snare drum, with an accompa-
nying “vox populi” chanting
phrases of approval in the
background. Give me a damn
break! Some of the lyrics
include: “Nihilism becomes the
vision/we wait in the
vacuum/living in the
vacuum/we go shopping for a
God/and get the God of shop-
ping.” Huh? What are they
talking about? Some things
are better left in the Literary
Magazine, this song is definite-
ly a case and point, or better
yet, this album.

All of the songs are written
by Rob Gallagher. He’s not a
bad poet but he is an awful
lyricist. His theme never
changes. Every single song is
about “universal despair.”
(There’s a cold wind
blowing./but scared eyes can’t
see/there’s a cold wind blow-
ing/rips through our destiny”)
— “Cold Wind.” I think he
needs an anti-depressant.
Gal|iano’s lyrics are too pre-
tentiously deep and downcast.

I  La Tengo.

After the 18th Dye perfor-
mance, we went out for pizza

 and assembled back at the the
 Best Western. After browsing
 through the 10 TV stations we’
 got, we realized it was time to
 go to Tramps. This club was

the best club l’ve been to.
Forget the Metropol, or even
the Trocadero in Philly.
Tramps is roomy, and it has a
great stage and an incredible
sound system. Blonde
Redhead was the first band to
take stage that night. Steve
Shelly loves them so much he
put them on his label, Smells
Like Records, and was in the
audience showing his support.
I met Shelly with another
teammate and discovered he
is really down—to-earth and
friendly. We talked about our
local music scene and the
future of Sonic Youth. No baby
is going to slow the band
down; a new album and tour is
in the works. Many journalists
dish out empty Sonic Youth
references when describing
Blonde Redhead. Who hasn’t
been influenced by SY? The
band started their set with a
schizophrenic mellow groove
that collided into a wall of feed-
back, only to retreat to safety
and collide again. The 12

string/six string guitar com I-
nations created such lush and
varying textures, riffs seemed
unnecessary. The rest of the
set continued with this intensi-
ty, bringing smiles to our entire
team. The Spinanes followed
with a quite different approach.
The guitar and drum duo just
rocked our socks off in a tradi-
tional fashion. After the four
clicks from the drumsticks, the
songs would take off and
never stop. The Spinanes
sound was full, and their stage
presence was huge. l was
impressed that two people
could gel so successfully into a
tight and snappy ensemble.
The seminal noise rocker
Thurston Moore (of Sonic
Youth) performed with some
friends, Steve Shelly and Tim
Folijhan (of Two Dollar Guitar),
under the name Thurston,
etc... Moore came equipped
with lyric sheets and a Fender
Jaguar and started off an hour
of crunchy, angular guitar
bliss. The Folijhan/Moore gui-
tar onslaught seemed tighter
and meaner than Thurston’s
work with SY. Shelly was
stretching out from the typical
syncopation, adopting a more
jazzy approach. Eight of the
nine songs were surprisingly
punky with the absence of
noise breaks and feedback-
drenched solos. The last song
started out with a delicate two-
part melody that erupted into
the most chaotic guitar explo-
sions ever witnessed. My brain

was going on, and my ears
almost bled. Then Moore and
company brought everything
back to a delicate stop as if
nothing happened. and left the
stage meekly. l was speech-
less. Shelly had told me that
the group had only played a
few parties before this show. I
only wish that I had had a tape
recorder. After the show,
Thurston gave one team
member a hug! The only band
fit to follow did: Stereo Lab. I
can’t say enough about this
band. Their trance-inducing
performance demonstrated
what good songwriting is all
about. A simple two-chord
change would be strummed by
a guitar, the bass would
weave a little melody that
countered the angelic vocal
lines and a Moog or Farfisa
droned on filling any remaining
hole. Stereo Lab’s drummer is
so incredibly disciplined that
it's scary. He never tired or
missed any of the tricky
changes the long songs
offered. The band's sound is
so intriguing it's spooky. After
their performance, we were
exhausted and went to sleep.
This is what we had come for.

Friday, our last day, was
filled with record shopping. If
you’re ever in the Village,
check out Kim’s Underground.
lt’s like Paul’s (in Bloomfield)
but larger.

The next show was at
Brownies and was Pittsburgh's
Thee Speaking Canaries. It
was the first time that I had
seen them. Although they

    

oak tree/noose in your look
that’s a following me/eyes full
of horrors don't understand.”
Well, neither do I Gallagher!
It's not only the lyrics that
make me queasy, but the
music is pure pishposh. It
reminds me of a kindergarten
classroom’s first day in the
music room. It is mostly per-
cussion and synthesizers with
a hint of strings (guitar), which
do not complement each other
at all. The vocals are a combi-
nation of rapping and singing,
(like I said, C&C Music
Factory) and sometimes,
yelling and chanting.

   

couldn’t comprehend what

I incredible album, they still .

rocked. They would have
made Eddie Van Halen blush!
All of the songs they played
are from an upcoming album
and are not for the weak of
heart. Two hand-tapping,
chunky chord changes, and
chops o’ plenty are what these
guys are all about.

We left after the set-ending
Police cover and proceeded to
the Knitting Factory. It was
cramped and sweaty. Most of
the team went to see
Tsunami, but l and another
met the members of Blonde
Redhead. We talked for two
hours; they wouldn’t let us go.
This was the last CMJ experi-
ence we had. We left the club
thinking of our long trip the
next day.

As we awoke and showered,
most were glad to be leaving.
The rap contingent of the team
wasn’t satisfied with the semi-
nar’s representation of the
genre. We were also question-
ing why we took all the promo-
tional junk which left the van
pretty cramped.

True, CMJ is one way for ‘

record labels and bands to sell
themselves, but with the right
attitude, a wealth of entertain-
ment is possible. It required
some patience and a few
Tylenol, but the team did enjoy
the music we took in:

CMJ made me realize that
no matter how anti-establish-
ment a music trend is, it is still
very marketable, and the big-
wigs will take every opportuni-
ty to influence your spending.
Oh, well. Gimme music.
Gimme shelter.

~ ' 

There is a fine line between
art and bullshit and this album
smears the boundary. The
music is awful. You can’t
dance to it with a straight face,
you can’t listen to it without
seeing a shrink first and you
can’t sing it because Galliano

can’t sing it. So what do you

do? You get a refund or hope
you can trade it in. in my unin-
hibited opinion, Galliano
should forget about the music
business and start a pizza
franchise in London, or if that
does not work, they could sell
their lyrics to Hallmark.

Arafat deserves Nobel

The Nobel Peace Prize has suddenly become the middle of a
rather un—peaceful controversy. Clandestine news reports say the
prize will be awarded to Yitzhak Rabin of Israel and Palestine
Liberation Organization chairman, Yasir Arafat on the contribu-
tions to the Middle East peace process.

The controversy centers around Arafat. Reportedly one com-

mittee member, Kaare Kristiansen, a longtime supporter of

Israel objects strenuouslyito Arafat, because of his past links to
terrorism. Kristiansen threatens to resign in protest, and it is
possible, however unlikely, the committee may meet again
before the week is out to change their decision.

The Pitt News believes Arafat deserves his share of the Nobel
Peace Prize. Bringing peace to the Middle East is one of the
most important events of this half century and it could not have
happened without the support of both Arafat and Rabin. Much
in the same way that Nelson Mandela and F. W. de Klerk shared
the award last year, Rabin and Arafat deserve to share the award
this year. ~

Granted, Arafat has been connected with terrorism in the past,
but his moral courage — which has weakened his position in the
eyes of many Palestinians —— to espouse peace rates him the
Noble Peace Prize.

Play the damn game

Say it ain’t so Joe, say it ain’t so. The National Hockey
League, for all intents and purposes, seems to be speeding down
the road so recently taken by Major League Baseball.

Yesterday NHL commissioner Gary Bettman rejected the lat-

est offer by the players, which will delay the start of the season
for the second time. The season was supposed to begin Oct. 1,
but was delayed for two weeks by an owners lockout. Now the
Oct. 15 start of the season has been delayed indefinitely, with no
end in sight.
’_ The players want to play. Unlike baseball, the owners are
locking the players out rather than the players’ striking. The
NHL owners originally rejected a players’ proposal to play the
season and negotiate alongthe way. This latest rejection virtual-
ly ensures some hockey games will be lost and threatens the
entire season.

What is this country coming to? Is it so hard to just play
sports? The owners have brought these troubles upon themselves
and now want everyone else to pay for them. Exorbitant salaries
have been willingly paid for years by the owners of all four
leagues of major professional sports teams. Now, salaries are
spiraling out of control and the owners want someone else to
solve their problems and foot the bill.

The- NHL is shooting itself in the foot. Hockey is booming
now like basketball did in the early ‘80s. The one sure way to
kill hockey (or baseball) is not to play any games. A message to
the owners: play the season and negotiate along the way!

U. S. policy is morally inconsistent

Something smells, and it is
coming from the White
House. The recent decisions .

6 made by our government to

send troops to Iraq, as well
as in the Gulf War, was to
give human rights and free-
dom to the Kuwaitis as
well as stopping Sadaam
Hussein. I believe this is bla-
tant propaganda being fed to
the American public.

If the United States gov-
ernment really cared about
human rights, it would have
been in Bosnia a few years

ago to stop the unmerciful
persecution, ethnic cleans-
ing, concentration camps and
rape camps against the
Bosnian Muslims, by the
Serbian Christians.

In this case however, the
government barely did any-
thing. I believe that if the
Muslims had been persecut-
ing the Serbs, this would
have been a different story.

It is clear that the main rea-
son the government is con-
cerned about Kuwait is
because of its oil, not

because of its people. As a
result, thousands upon
thousands of soldiers, both
Iraqi and American, have and
probably will die for this.

_If the United States really
wanted to get rid of Saddam
Hussein, it could easily
do this. Instead, innocent
people will continue to die
for oil, and the media will
continue to spread its propa-
ganda.

Reader applauds Casey's suggestions

I congratulate Governor Casey for his
insightful decision to nominate Judge

Scherer to the state’s Supreme
Court. The judge is well
thought of and indeed recog-
nized as a highly respected
jurist and resident in his coun-
ty.

His respect as a jurist, and his
obvious qualities of goodness,
compassion and character,

I believe if Judge Scherer is confirmed,
his statesmanship would contribute to

preserving the values we
cherish in this Common-

Furthermore, the confirma-

Scherer’s integrity would

help to restore any respect

and confidence that has
been lost in the Pennsylvania

Supreme Court through the removal of

Physics department wants telescope  

In The Pitt News of
Monday, Oct. 3, several
quotes appeared concerning
the Magellan Telescope
Project. One statement is:

“It is not a priority for the
physics department.”

Another is:

“The telescope is clearly
not in the long—term benefit
of the university.”

I am not sure that these
quotes are accurate, nor have
I heard them in the context of

  
 

the Senate Budget Policy
Committee’s deliberations.
Nevertheless, they do address
important issues.

The Magellan Telescope
Project is a priority of
physics and astronomy. The
physics and astronomy facul-
ty voted and endorsed this
project enthusiastically.

This project will provide
the long—term benefit of mak-
ing Pittsburgh a leading cen-
ter in astronomy and astro-

Panthers volley past YSU

Volleyball team wins in 4 games

By Adam Pincus
Staff Writer

The Pitt Volleyball team
continued its winning ways
last night at Fitzgerald
Fieldhouse by knocking off
Youngstown State
University.

It took the Lady Panthers
f o u r
g a m e s
and just
' u n d e r
t w 0
hours to
win the
' m a t c h

with the
scores of 15-6, 15-4, 9-15
and 15-6.

The win is the team’s third
in a row since losing last
Tuesday at Akron.

“After our loss to Akron,
one of the things that we

 

really worked on was the
mental,” head coach Cindy
Alvear said. “Physically, we
are there, and basically you
have to believe you will be
successful before you will
be. You can’t go in doubting
It.

‘‘I met individually with a
lot of the players, and Brian
[Begor] met with a couple of
the kids, and basically we
really instilled all the strong
points and what they do well.
And I think individually we
turned corners, and that
means collectively as a team
we turned corners, and when
you turn corners you win.”

One of the more obvious
things that has taken place
during the team’s recent win-
ning streak is that they
appear to be playing with
increased confidence, which
is visible to everyone watch-

“The nice thing that hap-
pens is 'when you go in
expecting to win, and you
do, it bolsters your confi-
dence even more,” Alvear
said.

Sara Mitchell led the way
for Pitt with 13 kills, and
Sarah Mikla was not far
behind with 10.

The team’s defensive
attack was very balanced as
Mitchell and Mikla once
again led the way with 15
and 12 digs respectively.

Jennie Driscoll and
Annemarie Mernagh both
had 11 digs to their credit.

Pitt handled Youngstown
State with ease in the first
two games.

They then became a bit
complacent in the third game
and let their sweep slip away.

Mikla named Big East
Player of the Week

By Adam Pincus
Staff Writer

For the second time this
season a Pitt volleyball play-
er has been selected as the
Big East Player of the Week.

Sarah Mikla earned the

 

Sarah Mikla

honors this week by helping
her Panther teammates win

two Big East Conference
matches to propel them back
into the top spot, which they
have held for the past six
years and nine of the last 12.

“Sarah got off to a real
slow start and I think she had
some shoulder problems and
she just wasn’t able to tenni-
nate the ball.” Pitt assistant
volleyball coach Brian Begor
said. “When you are a big
physical player and you are
not killing the ball. I think it
really affects your confi-
dence. Once her shoulder got
healthy and she started
killing the ball that just
picked up all the levels of her
game. I think she is such a
complete player and I think
she is really the key to our
defense.”

Pitt's Last Home Stand Results In
Convincing Win Over Lions, 26-0

(Editor’s Note: Pitt’s
“Dream Backfield” from
1936-1938 will be hon-
ored at halftime of the
Pitt-West Virginia game.
The backfield‘ hoisted the
Panthers .to National
Championships in ‘36
and ‘37 and was led by
fullback Marshall
“Biggie” Goldberg, who
was an All-American in
‘37-’38 and the Heisman
Trophy runner-up in ‘37.
Goldberg’s 1,957 career
rushing yards total was
then the all-time NCAA
record. He is ninth on
Pitt’s career rushing list
now. 1

Dick Cassiano, who
died in 1980, and Harold
“Curly” Stebbins played
at the halfback slots.
John Chickerneo was the
quarterback. The quartet
is still heralded as one of
the best backfields of all-
time.

The Pitt News recog-
nizes the "Dream
Backfield" by re-running
Bill Maz'efsky’s article on
the Panthers’— 26-0 win

over Penn State that
appeared in The Pitt
News‘ on Friday,
November 18, 1938.)

By Bill Mazefsky

“Don’t let anyone tell
you that there isn’t

Pitt team when
Marshall Goldberg

team.
SENIORS BOWL

Penn State was on hand
to renew a gridiron
friendship that extends
as far back in the years
as Pitt football goes. With
such good friends around,

 

a difference in the   . .   

is in there. He’s
the spark,” said
Dr. Jock
Sutherland'as he
stalked into the
comparatively
cheerful Pitt dress-
ing room after
Saturday’s bleary
day of football.

No one can tell
us any different.
Saturday, Pitt’s senior-
loaded football team,
which rightfully ranks as
one of the nation’s great-
est, had Marshall
Goldberg at fullback for
the first time in two
weeks and it looked every
bit the part of a national
‘championship caliber

  
 

it was appropriate that
the class of ‘39 should
give so ardent a football
farewell to the folks at
home.

Every senior was given
the chance to come out
and say goodbye as the
scoring unit, featuring
one of its two underclass-

men. Dick Cassiano went
around the Lion ends for
26 points while the boys
from up- state were
unable to come near the
Panther goal line.
The return to the Pitt
line-up of the fullback
Goldberg meant

 -97 the return of pre-

 

cise, spirited,
unstoppable Pitt.
After a series of
judicial errors,

occasioned by
rather mediocre
officiating, the

Panthers began to
roll.

One break
after another kept
the Panthers from

 settling down to

. the business of
gathering in some points
in the beginning of the
game. Finally, after con-
siderable maneuvering,
Pitt obtained the ball on

the State 47-yard line.

Four plays later, the
Panthers had their first
touchdown. Dick
Cassiano, who hardly

knows what it is to be
downed, ran around left
end for 26 yards. Stebbins
tried the other side on a
reverse that went for no
gain.

CASSIANO CARRIES

Then Chick decided
that the most propitious
thing to do was to keep
putting the ball in
Cassiano’s hands and let
the Phi Kap scholar keep
bouncing his way around
left end.

This strategy required
two more plays for a
touchdown. First, Dick
went for five yards, then
he jitterbugged for 17
more yards to dip across
the goal line standing up.
Bill Daddio kept his kick-
ing true to finish up the
Panthers first period
scoring, 7-0.

The second period found
the Pitt second team
remaining on a little up
speculation concerning
the ultimate result.

overjoyed to get his hands

Panthers winless in last three Homecoming games

    

t’s that
time of the
y e a r

. again. Time
 for the tradi-
tional Pitt
f o o t b a l 1
Homecoming
game.

Why is this
game differ-
ent than all other games?

Well considering recent his-
tory, the Homecoming game
hasn’t been different from any
other home game the Panthers
have played.

Ever since I was a freshman,
the football team has gone
from bad’ to worse. The
Homecoming. games I’ve been
a part of have all been losses,
but none of the games have
been blowouts. That’s about
the only positive thing you can
say about the past three
Homecoming games.

I thought I would be _a little
nostalgic and recap the past
three Homecoming games the

Columist

Serlin

Panthers have played.
°In my freshman year, 1991,
the Panthers faced the

Syracuse Orangemen. Going
into the game, the Panthers

were an impressive 5-1. Yes,
for those of you who weren’t
around then, there really was a
time when Pitt football had a
winning record. (Boy, those
were the good old days.) The
game saw the Orangemen
commit six turnovers, while
the Panthers only suffered one.

The one turnover the
Panthers had was costly. In the
third quarter, Alex Van Pelt
threw an interception in the
end zone after the Panthers had
recovered a Syracuse fumble
at the Pitt 20. The Panther run-
ning game was shut down by
the Orangemen defense.
Jermaine Williams and Tim
Colicchio combined for 69
yards on 20 carries.

With a running game of that
caliber, it would have been
tough for the Panthers to beat
my high school team. Not only
did the Panthers not have a
running game of their own, but
they couldn’t ﬁgure out how to
stop the Orange running
attack.

Syracuse running back
David Walker ran all over the
Panther defense. Walker had a
career day, racking up 138
yards and four touchdowns.

' Final score, Syracuse 31-27.

-1992 saw the Panthers take
on the East Carolina Pirates.
The Pirates were coming off
an 11-1 season, but were strug-
gling in ‘92 at 3-3. The
Panthers were 3-4 entering the
game with East Carolina.

The Panthers were plagued
by turnovers the entire game,
with six fumbles and two inter-

ceptions. Three of the fumbles

HOMECOMING
1994

were recovered by the Pirates.
East Carolina capitalized on
the Pitt turnovers, scoring 20
points off of them.

Trailing 21-3 at halftime, the

 

‘ chants of “Fire Hackett” came

blasting out of the pathetic
25,766 in attendance at Pitt
Stadium. The Panthers piled
up 565 total yards, but it
wasn’t enough to overcome
their mistakes.

That was the common theme
that season, as the Van Pelt led
offense often piled up big
numbers. The only problem
was they never figured out
how to win. The chants com-
ing out of the stands eventually
got quieter, only because by
the end of the year there was
no one sitting in them.

Final score, East Carolina
37-31.

°Last season the Panthers.
under new head coach Johnny
Majors, took on the Syracuse
Orangemen again. The
Panthers were a dismal l-4
entering the game against the
l9th—ranked Orangemen, but
the Homecoming crowd of
34,268 saw one heck of a ball-
game. ~

Pitt’s Curtis Martin sparked
the Panther offense, running
up a then personal best 206
yards on 37 carries. Martin had
several spectacular runs, often
“bouncing off of piles and
tackles to spring for a first
down or a huge gain in his
record-setting performance,”
according to an article that
appeared in The Pitt News the
Monday after the game.

Syracusewas led by quarter-

P-5

back Marvin Graves and his
two favorite receivers, Shelby
Hill and Marvin Harrison. Hill
caught two balls for 69 yards,
but it was Harrison who
burned the Pitt defense the
hardest, catching four passes
for 128 yards and a pair of
touchdowns.

The game was close
throughout and came down to
Majors deciding to go for the
win instead of the tie. With a
fourth down and two from the
Syracuse 3—yard line. Majors
opted to go for the touchdown
as opposed to a field goal.
Curtis Martin’s dive fell short
of the first down, and the
Panthers had thrown their last
punch in a game that never
should have been that close.

No one expected Pitt to stay
with the Orange, but given the
year Syracuse had last year, it
really would not have been the
end of the world to anyone in
Syracuse if the Orange had
lost. A Pitt win on the last play
of the game could have boost-
ed the morale of the team, but
instead the Panthers were left

' with their hearts broken. Pitt

could have, probably even

Martin, West the next Dream Backfield in '95?

et’is
forget
about

the grim pre-
sent for a '
moment.
There’s an
exciting pos-
sibility loom-
ing in the
near future
for Pitt’s football team.

This possibility is an explo-
sive one.

Curtis Martin, who erupted
for 251 yards in Pitt’s season
opener against Texas, injured
his right ankle blocking early
in the second quarter in the
Panthers’ only win of the sea-
son against Ohio University.

From then on Pitt’s offense
stumbled, except for one per-
son —-— Martin’s backup, Billy
West. West
started right
where
Martin
stopped, as
the most
dominating
back in the
Big East with his 123 yards a
game, the best in the confer-
ence. C

This gets me to my point.
There’s a glaring possibility

 

 

ly start if he stays, so that
leaves West as his apprentice
for another Season, wasting
West’s talents.

Well, there are a few solu-
tions that can turn Pitt back to
its roots as the offensive
machine that it was many
moons ago.

Start them both. Start Martin
and West and scrap the block-
ing fullback. It wouldn’t be the
good, old—fashioned, smash-
mouthed running game that
we’re used to, but it sure will
excite the crowd and electrify
the scoreboard. V

The opposing defense
wouldn’t be able to hone in on
one back: they’d have to worry
about them both. That would
exploit Martin’s open field
prowess, and re—insert the

  '94 Ass

“Cutback” into Curtis, which
has made him Pitt’s fifth all-
time leading rusher.

Majors can use West as the
inside back, which would alle-
viate some pressure from
Martin’s nagging little injuries,
as well as take Martin to the
outside for the big runs.

Pitt’s new motto next year
can be “The Two-Headed
Monster.”

‘ Another possibility is to
keep the fullback. This would
enable Majors to scrap his
nonexistent pro offense and
use the wishbone formation in
the backfield, a formation pop-
ularized in colleges with domi-
nating backﬁelds. The wish-
bone lines a blocking fullback
first with two halfbacks behind
him, which would give the

Panthers a three-man attack.

This would allow Pitt to uti-
lize the middle more, while the
idea of Martin or West break-
ing to the outside would
always linger in the opposi-
tion’s mind.

Watching the Syracuse mas-
sacre last weekend sparked the
last possibility. What if Martin
or West worked hard in the
offseason, taking snaps at the
quarterback slot? Yes, run the
option, a deviation of the wish-
bone offense. Preposterous —
probably. Potent — most defi-
nitely.

Look at all the offensive .
machines in college football
that run the option with an ath-
letic quarterback/halfback.
Nebraska, Oklahoma,
Alabama, Notre Dame (with

exception of this year),
Colorado and Syracuse. who
ran it with perfection and ulti-
mately caused Pitt’s demise.

Just imagine: West takes the
snap, fakes the handoff to the
fullback, rolls right with
Martin trailing and, when the
linebacker commits to West, at
the very last moment pitches
to Martin for a 40-yard touch-
down trot. It sounds beautiful.

Having never witnessed
Pitt’s “Dream Backfield” in
the 1930s, I can’t determine
who would be the better back-
field. But one thing is certain:
if Martin and West would both
start next season, it would be a

Pitt D‘ battered after series of offensive machines

 

By Tom Schneider
Staff Writer

The annual Pitt-West
Virginia slugfest has always
been looked upon as a fight
for bragging rights —— a wel-
come sight to fans from
Western Pennsylvania as
well as from West Virginia. '

There is one group of indi-
viduals, however, which is

probably
h a p p i e r
than most
to see the
M ou nti e s
come to
town — a battered, bruised
and bloodied Pitt defense.

The Mountaineers should
be the most welcome sight
the Panther defense has seen
in weeks. This will be the
first time in recent memory
that the, Panthers will not be
facing an overpowering
offense.

In its past-four games, the
Pitt defense has been ripped
for an average of 475.5 yards
of total offense, including
618 yards alone in the 31-7
debacle at the Carrier Dome.

For the most telling stat of
all, look no further than
Pitt’s defense against the run.
The Panthers have surren-
dered an average of 262
yards in their five losses,

accounting for 58 percent of - ’

their opponents’ total offen-
sive output in those games.

That total includes an atro-
cious 414 yards rushing by
Syracuse last week.

Majors said. “That was our =

The fact that the Panthers’
last four games have includ-
ed contests against offensive
machines from Ohio State,
Boston College and Syracuse
has not given the defensive
corps much time to lick its

 

woun_ds. .

It’s been more like dousing
them with lemon juice.

To this, just one thing can
be said: thank goodness for
the Mountaineers.

“The game is not as impor-
tant this year because of the
two teams’ records,” Majors
said of Pitt’s 1-5 and WVU’s
2-4 records. “But it is impor-
tant to us because we need
the win. It would be a

That is the intimidation or

of a connoisseur of. A four-
year starter on Pitt’s offensive
line, Mollica, 22, has built
himself into one of the best
centers in the Big East.

But the fifth-year senior
didn’t start out that way. A
tackle while playing high
school ball for Edison High
School in Huntington Beach,
Calif., Mollica was too small
to play that position at Pitt.

“When I came in as a fresh-
man, I was about 250 pounds,”

he said. “And I was leg heavy,

I had no real upper—body
strength. I knew I’d be moved
in to the interior line.”

His prophecy came true and
what followed was a baptism
of fire.

‘‘It was the year I was red-
shirted,” Mollica recollected.
“We lost our first and second

team centers, and there was

nobody there.
“So my coach just threw me

in. I was the starting center for ~

three days of camp. And to tell
you the truth I was more afraid
than excited, because I didn’t
know any of the plays, and I
was blocking guys a lot bigger
and faster than I was.”
Needless to say, that is no
longer the case. The 6-foot-4-
inch Mollica now weighs 275
°M0llica, page P-I0

tremendous boost to our con-
fidence.”

West Virginia not only
brings a disappointing record
into this 87th installment of
“The Backyard Brawl,” but
also an offense that could not
be termed “scintillating.”

The Mounties’ total offen-
sive output this season ranks
66th in the NCAA, while
their running game, the
aspect that Pitt has had so
much trouble against this
season, is netting 141.2 yards
per game ——- good for 69th in
the NCAA. ’

Good news for the
Panthers is that WVU’s fea-

ture back, Robert Walker, is
averaging only 65 yards per
game in 1994, as opposed to
his 100+ yard average during
the Cinderella 1993 cam-
paign.

Last season, Walker
torched the Panthers for 163
yards in the Mountaineers’

42-21 victory in
Morgantown. This will put
extra pressure on the

Panthers’ linebacking crew
to stop the WVU running
game.

The Mountaineers, who
spanked Pitt last year in their
bid to become national cham-
pions, will look to get a win
Saturday in hopes of regener-
ating their season. A

“The first half of the sea-
son is gone, and there is
nothing we can do to change
our record,” Nehlen said.
“We can do something about
the second half, and hopeful-
ly we can use the Pitt game
to get us going.”

In order to win against the

WVU punter Todd Sauerbrun doubles as a long-range ﬁeld goal kicker.

- By Ed Ziegenfuss

Staff Writer

Not since the days when

I Reggie Roby left Iowa and

became a Miami Dolphin has a
punter produced the numbers
that West Virginia University’s
Todd Sauerbrun has this season.

He leads the nation in punting
with an average of 50.7 yards
on 37 punts this season. With
statistics like this, the senior
from Setauket, N.Y. is almost
guaranteed a spot on an NFL
roster next season. If Sauerbrun

retains his present average per
kick, he will establish an
NCAA single-season record.
The mark is currently held by
Roby, who averaged 49.8 yds.
per punt in 1981.

“My goal ever since I started
punting was to lead the nation
in punting,” Sauerbrun said. “I
take great pride in my wor .”

“Sauerbrun is an excellent
punter,” WVU head coach Don
Nehlen said. “There is no doubt
about it.”

Despite having the best
punter in the nation, West

Virginia has a‘ net punting aver-
age of 41.1 yards per game.
The Mountaineers have given
up 20 returns for 353 total
yards this season.

This season has by far been
the best for Sauerbrun. Of his
career best punts, the top five
have been during this season.

Against Maryland this season
with long punts of 67 and 61
yards, Sauerbrun averaged 54.3
yards on seven punts, establish-
ing a new Mountaineer field
record for punting average. The

high 69 tackles to Pitt
Stadium on Saturday, with
the sting of the Syracuse
game still fresh in his
mind. He and middle line-
backer Jason Chavis, who
leads the Panthers with 41
solo tackles, will be count-
ed on to give Pitt a fighting
chance in this game by
bottling up Walker.

If the front line can suc-
cessfully stop the
Mountaineers on the
ground, then cornerback
Denorse Mosley will be
able to have a field day
with the ineffective WVU
quarterback tag team of
Eric Boykin and Chad
Johnston.

Mosley is currently sec-
ond in the Big East with
four interceptions and
highlights the Panther pass
defense, which has allowed
197.3 yards passing per

game.

Mosley could also make
an impact on punt returns,
in which he leads the
Panthers with a 15.5 yards
per return average.

The Mountaineers have
given up an average of
17.7 yards per punt return
this season — a casualty of
strong-legged punter Todd
Sauerbrun’s NCAA-lead-

ing 50.7 yard average.

One change in the defen-
sive backfield is at strong
safety, where Gerald
Simpson will start after
playing most of the season
as an outside linebacker.

He saw some action at
strong safety last week
against Syracuse, and
Majors liked what he saw
enough to start him this
week in place of regular
starter Daryl Cash.

‘On offense, the Panthers
and tailback Billy West are

licking their chops, look-
ing forward to taking
advantage of a WVU rush-
ing defense that has given
up 161.2 yards per game.

West, Pitt’s feature tail-
back since Curtis Martin
went down with an injury
in the second game of the
season, is leading the Big
East and is 14th in the
nation with an average of
123 yards per game.

The real question mark
for the Panther offense is
at quarterback, where
starter Sean Fitzgerald is
questionable after aggra-
vating a sprained ankle
while playing against the
Orangemen.

Fitzgerald was replaced
in the Syracuse game by
John Ryan, who completed
11 of 20 passes for 194
yards and one interception.
Ryan could likely get the
call on Saturday.

Dawson,” he said. “I try to
mimic or pick up on things

_they do, like foot movements,

hand movements and how they
position themselves. I think
I’ve learned a lot from that.”

And now as his career at Pitt
winds to a close, Mo1lica’s
thoughts cautiously turn to the
pros. '

“I’d like to play for the NFL.
It has always been a dream of
mine,” Mollica said. “But, I
don’t dwell on it.

“The way I see it, I play for
Pitt,” he said. “I play as hard
as I can to win at Pitt, and the
better I do at Pitt the better
chance I have to play on the
next level.”

Mollica knows better than
anyone that playing hard to
win and winning can be two
very different things. He said
one of the reasons he came
here was for the opportunity to
go to bowl games every year,
to compete for the top 20
every year. Winning only four
games in the last two seasons
weighs on him.

“It’s really frustrating from
the standpoint that, particularly
this year, I know we’re a good
team. I believe it,” he said. “I
see these guys on the field and
I see them do incredible
things. But we get into games
and

“But I haven’t lost hope,” he
added. “And I don’t think any-
one is going to cash it in. I
know I’m not going to cash it
in. I never have before, and
especially in my senior year I
don’t plan on it now.”

Playing under Johnny
Majors the last couple seasons
has helped, because, Mollica
said, “I know it’s going to hap-
pen.”

“He’s really turning this pro-
gram around and getting things
going. I can see it every day in
the effort and attitude of the
guys on the team.”

And you can bet if there’s
one guy who doesn’t have any
regrets, it’s Mollica.

“When I see Pitt winning
games and being back where
Pitt should be,” he said. “There
will be a sense of satisfaction
to know that the work that I
put in, although it didn’t get us
to where we wanted to be then,
had an effect in the long run.”

He’s talking about all those
pancakes he made.

Begor said Mikla often
makes her teammates
play better because they
almost always know
what she is going to do
on the court.

“She is so organized
and so balanced that she
is very easy to play
defense around. She is
about the only person on
the team, in a lot of
regards, [where] you
almost always know
what she is going to do in
a situation. She is very
level-headed, very bal-
anced, and as a person
that is her temperament
and it carries over into

her game. The kind of’

player like that usually is
not a player that gets a lot
of accolades.”

Hall. I
For the week Sarah had
45 kills, 46 digs, a .323
hitting percentage, 2
block solos and 12 block
assists.

“I am very proud of
her,” teammate Carrie
Thornton said. “She had
two great matches last
week and she definitely
deserved it.”

Mikla is a very low key
and humble person and
she gives credit to her
teammates for helping
her win the honor.

“It’s a great honor,”
Mikla said. “I am very
excited about how the

That was exciting for me
to see everyone play well.

“I have more self conﬁ-
dence in myself after this
weekend. I played a lot
stronger and aggressive.”

Begor knows that
Mikla is very humble and
was glad that she was
chosen for the award
because players like her

However, to its cred-
it, the team bounced back in
the fourth game to finish off
the match.

“I thought Pitt was a very
strong team,” Youngstown
State head coach Joe Conroy
said. “The first two games,
they came out and they were
Pitt. I thought the third game
was a see~sawish type of
game. We were overpowered
and outmanned, but that’s
recruiting. I like coming here
and playing. It is good for
our program to play that kind
of volleyba1l.”

One of the reasons for the
team’s success is that it is
playing in a more relaxed
way and with more poise and
maturity.

“This is a team where we
are not going to get a big
crushing kill or a really big
play to turn the momentum,”
Alvear said. “We have got to
be consistent and put our-
selves in situations to be suc-
cessful.

“If you are doing the same
thing and the right thing over
and over and over again,
then pretty soon the cards are
going to fall your way, and
you are going to have the
opportunity to score and
have the opportunity to win
matches. Mentally, they have
taken some giant steps, and it
is a very positive situation.”

Some of the players have
made a few adjustments to
their games in order to help
the team be more successful.

“Carrie Thornton is a real
dynamic player,” Alvear
said. “Sometimes she takes it
too far and tries to do too

"much, so she has taken some

steps to level off.

“Jennie Driscoll is another
one that can try to win
matches with each try-, and
that is not going to happen.

“She has been a lot more
disciplined and her focus has
been a lot more broader. She
is processing information in

The biggest change to
which the team has had to
adjust is that it was formerly
used to having a go—to player
in Ann Marie Lucanie.

The members only needed
to be support players. So
when this year started out,
they did not have a player to
bail them out of the tougher
situations. T h e y
discovered that they had to
change their style, and it
took some time for the play-
ers to adjust.

“Everyone on this team has
always played with the pres-
ence of Ann Marie Lucanie,
where she was kind of the
go-to and they never really
had to step it up and take a
role that had a huge impact.

“I think we got to the point
where there was a conception
of support players and a star.
So now that there is no star,
they still saw themselves as
support players, and that is
no longer the case, because
everyone on this team has to
have have a solid match in

order for us to be successful.

“We have the physical tal-
ent, and its just the matter of
them believing they can rise
to the level,” Alvear said.
“We are a better team
because everyone can do a
good job, and I am not so
sure how much this group
believed that.”

Senior outside hitter
Thornton agrees that the
team has been playing with
more confidence‘.

“This past weekend helped
us a lot,” Thornton said. “It
just seemed that everything
came together, and now we
can only build from that.
We’ve been working really
hard, and we have been try-
ing to put it together. And
finally, like I said, it has
come together.”

Pitt will try to increase the
number of its consecutive
Big East wins to 19 this
weekend as the team travels
to Syracuse on Saturday and
then to St. John’s on Sunday.

game.

Statistically neither rank
high in the Big East, and
both have failed in making
the big plays. But Nehlen
has made his decision for
this week ——Johnston.

“Chad will be our starting
quarterback right now, and
he’ll be the starting quarter-
back unless he goes sour,”
Nehlen said.

“The quaterback’s job is to
get the ball in the end zone,
and if we don’t get any
points, you put in another
quarterback to get points on
the board.” A

Although Michigan trans-
fer Boykin has attempted
more passes and has thrown
for more yardage, Johnston
ranks higher in passing effi-
ciency.

But what separates the QB
parity is one glaring statistic
— Boykin has thrown five
interceptions. Johnston has
two himself, and both have
only tossed two touchdowns.

Coming off a stellar year
in which the Mountaineers

had several fifth-year seniors ~

on both offense and defense,
it is a matter of inexperience
that haunts this football
team.

“No one wants to be 2-4
after six [games], and it is
unusual for us,” Nehlen said.
“We had seniors last year
that played and led our team;
they’re gone.”

Being one of many pro-
grams in a rebuilding stage,
WVU will look to two stand-
outs on offense, one of
whom Nehlen would like to
keep on the sidelines.

Todd Sauerbrum leads the
nation with a punting aver-
age of 50.7 yards on 37
attempts this season.

“He’s a great kicker,
there’s" no question about it,”
Nehlen said.

Setting a new record for a
punting average, the senior
booted two punts for 67 and
61 yards.

Yet, it was at the dreaded
Nebraska game that
Sauerbrum gave his best
effort.

On nine "punts, he kicked
for an incredible 60.1 yards

- per kick, which included

both a WVU and Kickoff
Classic record, a 90-yarder.

The other glimmer of hope
is Rahsaan Vanterpool, a
sophomore split end. Though
he only has one touchdown
on the season, Vanterpool
leads the Mountaineers in all
receiving categories.

He also holds the punt
returning responsibilities,
with his longest being for 41
yards.

Yet it is the Mountaineer
defense that will have to
shine. Along with senior
linebacker and team captain
Matt Taffoni, WVU will
have to contain Pitt halfback
Billy West. ‘

A defense which has

old record was 53.7 yards.

His best effort came in the
Kickoff Classic, held at the
New W Jersey Meadowlands
against Nebraska. With nine
punts for an amazing average
of 60.1 yards per punt, includ-
ing a WVU and Kickoff Classic
record 90—yarder, Sauerbrun
rewrote the record books. That
90-yard punt broke his own
record of 63 yards from last
season and broke Brigham

44.3 yards in 1992 and 45.1
yards last season. His career
average is now 46.2 yards for
140 punts.

Sauerbrun not only punts but
is the Mountaineers’ kickoff
specialist. He has sent 15 of his
18 kickoffs into or through the
end zone for a touchback this
season.

“He is an excellent kickoff
guy,” Nehlen said.

“I feel by kicking off as well
as punting that I am more valu-

should have, won the game.
The Orangemen had no right
"to win that game, but then
again they didn’t deserve to
win any of their games last
year

Final score, Syracuse 24-21.

And that brings us up to this
year, which may be the most
important Homecoming game
this school has seen in the
past several years.

The Panthers take on the
woeful West Virginia
Mountaineers, in a game that
has huge ramifications for the
Big East football conference.

This game might as well be
called “The Basement Brawl”
this year, as the two teams sit
on the bottom of the Big East
football standings. This game
will most likely determine the
worst team in the league after
Temple, and the Panthers
would love to dig themselves
out of that position.

If the Panthers do not defeat
West Virginia, I for one am
giving up. If this team can not
beat the Mountaineers, what
hope is there?

This year is a far cry from
1991 when the Panthers went
into Homecoming 5-1, but
according to Johnny Majors,
this year’s team is improved
from last year.

This game will be a test of
his observation, and will
hopefully give me my first
ever Homecoming win at Pitt.

Matt Serlin is the Managing
Editor for The Pitt News.

proven to be stingy at
times this year, the
Mountaineers have
given up just nine dri-
ves of nine or more
plays in six games this
year

“Matt is a smart
player, a tough player,
who has had some
injuries,” Nehlen said.

While looking at
statistics, the defen-
sive unit appears bad
when it comes to giv-
ing up points.

Of the 16 touch-
downs scored against
WVU this season, six
have been due to
M 0 u n t a i n e e r
turnovers, one which
included a blocked
field goal attempt.

Even though this
defense may look bad
on paper, they are
more experienced than
the offense and will be
a key ingredient if the
Mountaineers are to
win.

A win for WVU
would give them their
first win in Big East
conference play. The
rivalry which has been
dubbed for ages, “The
Backyard Brawl”,
would be better suited
this year with the title
of “The Basement
Brawl.”
