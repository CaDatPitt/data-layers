Chem Students

A Get New Labs .
In Alumni Hall

When -the new chemistry labora-
tories now under construction in
Alumni hall reach completion, the
University will be equipped with

‘the latest developments in labora-

tory facilities, according to Ray-
mond L. Coss, superintendent of
building and grounds.

Venturing no opinion as to when
the new laboratories would be ﬁn-
ished and opened for classes, Mr.
Coss declared that the work was
progressing rapidly, and that the
project would be completed “in the
near future.”

Construction of a chemistry la-
boratory is a complex job, explain-
ed Mr. Coss. Gas, water, and elec-
tric outlets must be provided for
each individual table, a task which
takes considerable time.

An eiﬁcient vacuum exhaust sys-
tem is also installed . The system
will eliminate from the laboratories

quickly all gaseous waste products

of experiments, declared Mr. Coss.
Contrary to a popular rumor
about campus, the physics laborator-

V ies will not be movedbut will re-

main in Thaw hall, even after the
completion of the new chemistry

1 laboratories.

Work going on along Bigelow
boulevard will also be completed
within a short time, stated Mr. Coss.

1 The city is installing a new curb-

stone along that area.

T 0 Act as Aides
At Parents’ Fete

Over 1,200 parents are expected to
attend the chancellor’s receptionsfvor
parents of freshmen Friday evening.

Considerably more than half the
900 invitations sent to parents last
week have been accepted. Four
hundred and ﬁfty acceptances were
received by the chancellor’s office
Monday.

Russell G. Wichmann, University
organist, and Women’s choral will
provide the musical entertainment
on the program.

Chancellor John G. Bowman will
welcome his guests, the parents of
the class of 1944, after introductory
remarks by Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear,
dean of men, who heads the recep-
tion committee.

Following conferences of faculty
members with parents in rooms of
the Cathedral, refreshments will be
served in the Commons Room. Par-
ents may meet other faculty mem-
bers and deans of the undergraduate
schools during the social period.

Student aides, '70 men and 130
women, will assist with the program
as ushers and informants. Members
of honorary activity fraternities, so-.
cial fraternity presidentsand other
men and women leaders on campus,
have been asked to serve as aides.
They were chosen on the basis of
service to the University, scholar-
ship, and leadership.

Dr. Bowman originated the re-
ception in 1921 to acquaint parents
with faculty members and admin-
istrative officers, and to discuss
problems concerning the students’

‘ interest at the University. 1

The reception is for parents only,
emphasized Dr. Lanfear, not for
freshmen themselves.

University Oﬂicials
Get to Root of It Al.l

“Woodsman, spare those trees”
might well be the theme song for
the boys and girls who strolled
hand in hand along the Forbes

street walk. With roots torn up

and branches strewn over the side-
walks, with dry leaves sticking in
the mud, the ten trees lining the
walk are being removed.

Because of the possibility of
their roots causing a buckling of
the sidewalk, and of the City’s in-
sistence that the University be
liable for any injury sustained by
pedestrians which was caused by
the buckling, school oﬂicials gave
the city permission to remove the
trees.

The debris bordering the side-
walk and ﬁlling the gutter of the
Forbes street block between Bige-
low boulevard and Belleﬁeld ave-
nue will be cleared away as soon
as the job can be ﬁnished.

It wouldn’t be conducive to ro-
mantic strolling, anyway, they say.

Miller t0Try ‘Comic’ Strip
In Coming Issue of Panther

We have been assured by an of-
ficial statement from the offices of
the Pitt Panther, humorous publica-
tion of the University, that the glor-
iﬁed comic-strip will come out this
Wednesday after many unsuccessful
attempts at hibernation. _

To lessen thevinitial shock of the
price, the Panthers plan to greet
both of its customers with (and we
quote) “the most beautiful cover
ever to grace the Jﬁrst page of a
magazine . . . a satisfaction to both
sexes.”

Having absorbed. this graphic se-
dative, the remaining customer (the
other had some studying to do), will

-leaf through and ﬁnd a ‘feature
story by Marjorie. Munroe, C42,.

about how 10 lovely girls picked

three lovely men as the outstand-
ing glamour pants of the University.
There will be two pages devoted,
after a fashion, to men’s and wo-
men’s fashions. The models will be
students. ’ ' ‘ '
The customers, who must still be
.. looking at it, will next ﬁnd some
gossip, a cardiograph, and an inti-
mate study of the ﬂora‘ and fauna
of State hall, the roost of the en-

. gineers.

There will be a story on the prob-
lems of spotting the plays at a foot-
ball game by Bill McElwain, C41,

and another on the split personali-
ties of professors in their conduct
with parents and their behavior to-
wards students.‘ I
' This last story will be appreciated
by the customer, who is by this time
frustrated enough. . .  .

Charles Bowser will be the ﬁnal
speaker on the program.

Fraternity men and independents
will be scattered throughout the
audience in their respective groups.
Individual cheers by each group are
promised. Purpose of this feature,
according to Ben Foote, C42, chair-
man of the affair, is not to antagon-
ize groups, but to provide more
spirit for the rally.

Fraternities To Decorate

According to Alvin Ludwig, BA41,
president of Interfraternity council,
all houses will be decorated in ac-
cordance with the theme of “Beat
He-— Out of State.” The decora-

A committeeof faculty men will
judge the decorations and a prize
will be awarded the house with the
most original and most appropriate
decorations. An Owl photographer
will take pictures of the four prize
winning layouts.

A progressive dance has been
planned by IF council for Saturday
evening. All students from the
University and Penn State have
been invited to dance in all frater-
nity houses, according to Rae Young,
BA40, IF social chairman.

Moral \Veakness;
Another Obituary

Pierre Cot, a member of Frai1ce’s late anti-
Fascist government, spoke a good word for polit-
ical, economic, and military change.

The two greatest factors responsible for
France’s military and political collapse, he said,
were: (1) the breakdown of the morale of the
proletariat sympathetic to socialist-reformist ideas
and more important (2) the breakdown of the
morale of the upper middle class, the bourgeoisie.

The moral breakdown of the Communists and
the workers extended over a period of time, prog-
ressively affected by non-employment of sanctions
against Italy during the Ethiopian war, the non-
intervention policy toward the Spanish Loyalists,
and the Munich Pact. This disillusion toward Dem-
ocratic France resulted, on a big scale, in the Nazi-
Soviet pact.

The breakdown of the morale of the upper mid-
dle class was caused by anti-communist, anti-demo-

cratic, anti-socialist propaganda. This 'type_ of
propaganda was designed to make the bourgeoisie
afraid of everybody but the Fascists.

This, then, represents a France ﬁghting Fascism,
yet split inside by propaganda and distrust. We,
in America, are ﬁghting Fascism, too. If we do
the same things France did, we will be open to the
same kind of moral breakdown. And we are taking
some of the same steps to disaster that France took.

[Editor’s Note: The purpose of the following col-
umn is "to point out signiﬁcant news in a novel manner
so that the news will be read. Ed Beigel borrowed
the effective style from as young American novelist.
The novelist used this style to set the time for the
various parts of his novel. The style consists of frag-
mentary sentences and paragraphs from newspaper
stories. This style is to interpret news, to point out
what is ‘signiﬁcant all over the world and particularly
in the United States. This “newsreel” is a document
of the Present. It is not hard to read if you take it
for what it is: signiﬁcant headlines and signiﬁcant

Tyson Throws New Light on Economic Setup
Of America in Current Defense Preparation

ERTINENT comments on the No.

1 U. S. immediate economic
problem were introduced by Dr.
Francis D. Tyson, professor of eco-
nomics, in a paper on “Some Eco-
nomic Aspects of the Defense Pro-
gram: War-Time Price and Labor
Policies,” presented before the So-
cial Science seminar in the Faculty
club last week.

Coming at the beginning of na-
tionwide discussion of the effects
of the national defense program on
the U. S. economy—especially prices,
wages, and cost of living—Dr. Ty-
son’s own summarization, and his
review of the recent special inves-
tigation of wartime control of
prices conducted by the Brookings
Institution of Washington, serve as
a good foundation for University
students seeking to know more
about national policies than merely
newspaper headlines and draft num-
bers.

“The increasing immediate effect
of the defense program is now ob-
servable,” Dr. Tyson revealed. “Al-
most $6,000,000,000 of government
contracts or 71 per cent of those
provided by Congress were let dur-
ing September alone. A program
of such magnitude means increased
employment, especially in the man-
ufacturing industries. The net in-
crease in all lines of employment
in September was 927,000. Net un-
employment is now 6,829,000. The
greatest employment increases oc-
curred in aircraft, ship building,
machine tool, engine, and aluminum
products industries; but increases
also took place in foundries, ma-
chine shops, electrical equipment
plants, sawmills, and no-ferrrous
metals plants. The Federal Reserve
Board index has just reached a new
highiof 127.”

ODAY we are very optimistic,

so long as we overlook the fact
that the United States, like every
other great nation, has turned to
temporary armament production to
take up the slack in its industrial
plant. Living costs today are still
15 per cent below 1929, and 2.5 per

cent below the 1937 boomlet. But
experiences during the ﬁrst World
War period show that prices in gen-
eral may soon tend to increase, and
the cost of living will then gradually
increase for the salaried classes.

“The issue turns upon the inevit-
ability of war time inﬂation,” Dr.
Tyson concluded, using the term
“inﬂation” to mean an increase in
the total amount of money and cred-
it greater than the increase in the
output of goods, which would be
valued by the existing ‘amounts of
money and credit. When this hap-
pens, each unit of output will be
represented by more money, and
prices will go up. Banks will .in-
crease their loans to business and
government, wages will advance.
And the spiral will rise until the
wartime production and demand re-
cede or cease, and a deﬁationary
movement sets in, usually resulting
in a post—war depression like those
of 1921 and 1930-34.

ISTORICALLY this vicious cir-
cle has occurred: political and
economic maladjustments resulting
in armament expenditures and war,
the war production in turn causing
price inﬂation, which is inevitably
followed by deﬂation, and so on.
This all-around insecurity can be
met in two places: 1) preventing
the wartime price inﬂation; 2) cre-
ating a stable economy during the
“peace” period, and institutionaliz-
ing peace.

“A total war . like World
War II may inevitably bring .
inﬂation to the nation involved.”
But “in a. short and limited effort
like that on which the United States
has just entered there is no eco-
nomic necessity for a wide price in-
crease. The projected $16,000,000,-
000 program for the next four years
is but a fraction of our existing sur-
plus capacity . . . and the effects
of such a program could easily be
controlled by present machinery of
national price administration,” he
said.

It all started when Frank Miller
dashed into the oﬁice, beating his
chest and pulling his hair out.

“Heavens t’Betsy,” he swore. “I
no sooner get used to Daylight Sav-
ings Time than they start playing
around with Thanksgiving. Now
I’ll never get the Panther out on
time.” ‘

We ﬁled him away under ‘N’ and
locked the cabinet. A few min-
utes later the door opened again
and in walked three Indians.

“Ugh,” said Indian number one
for purposes of identiﬁcation. “We
come to find out when Thanksgiving
be this year.”

“November ﬁfth,” said Rugy,
munching on a handful of gefuelte
ﬁsh. '

The Indians left with gusto. After
a while gusto came back.

Jack Hoeveler came in and said,
“Somebody call me a‘ taxi.” No-
body said “You’re a taxi” and Jack
wanted to ﬁght.

“I’ll use jiu—jitsu on you,” I of-
fered.

“Don’t be so race-conscious,” he
answered.

Rugy stepped on Jack’s adam’s
apple.

Jack said, “Just for that you’re
number one on the pogrom.”

Governor James came in and
Rugy left. “When is Thanksgiv-
ing?” he screamed.

“Twenty-ﬁrst,” I said.

“Twenty-eighth,” he said.

“Twenty—sixth,” said the down-
town papers.

George Washington came in with
a colored gentleman.

I-loeveler, who cannot be side-
tracked, said, “One-ﬁfty—eight.”
The colored gentleman took out a
pad and asked, “Straight or com-
bination?”

Frank Miller slithered out of the
cabinet and Governor James left.

“I have the answer,” he sang, to
the tune of the second movement of
Tschaikowswy’s ﬁfth. “I’m going
to celebrate them all at one time.”

He lit a pinwheel, sang the na-
tional anthem, waved the ﬂag, slid
down the chimney, played taps, put
on a false face, and ate half a fried
turkey, southern style.

' Frank got up and the turkey left.

tained effort—-such as entering the
war or vastly increasing production
for Great Britain——the scale of our
porblem changes.” It seems at pres-
ent that the effective regulation
and adjustment of prices by govern-
ment could only succeed if public
opinion was favorable to a more
general control by government over
business and industrial policy. That
is the only way the wartime inﬂa-
tion—deﬂation disaster can be pre-
vented.

N this time, Dr. Tyson reviewed
the plan of John Maynard Key-
nes, outstanding British economist,
for the deferment of salaries and
wage payment, with the provision
for post-war reimbursement, this
control to prevent both wartime
inﬂation and post-war deﬂation. If
enacted, the Keynes plan might op-
erate both in Britain and America
to alleviate the problem.

Dr. Tyson summarized the rea-
sons for wartime inﬂation as (1)
the placing of large government or-
ders on a competitive basis, (2) in-
crease in business orders for inven-
tories, (3) wage rate increases, and
(4) expanded consumer buying
power at the same time that the
production of consumer goods is be-
ing sacriﬁced for war goods.

Inﬂationary movements can be
controlled at the start if (1) army
and navy -departments are kept from
competing against each other, (2)
if the government subsidizes plant
expansion, (3) if wages are not al-
lowed to increase except in the in-
terests of health and efficiency, (4)
and~—most important—if the de-
fense effort is ﬁnanced by taxes and
not Liberty Loan bonds, thus hold-
ing the money and credit base
stable, and keeping the money sys-
tem in constant circulation.

However, such a comprehensive
program could scarcely be success-
fully operated in the U.- S. unless
the outward forms of democratic
procedure were suspended or at
least greatly limited for the sake of
effective war effort and post-war
stability.

University as well as names of per-
sons in charge, the where and when
of all important social and educa-
tional events in the city, the office
numbers and hours of all faculty
members, night and graduate school
information, information about na-
tionality rooms and the Cathedral
in general, hours of opening and
closing of Tuck shops and libra-

I To the Editor

Editor, the Pitt News: . _
“American youth must learn now, for the time will

shortly come when there will be no more learning-—of
truthf” Pitt News, Nov. 8.

“Shortly” was the right word. Already Duquesne
university has closed down on traditional freedom of
speech. Duquesne has therefore closed down the tra-
ditional freedom of thought and freedom of learning
for her students. If my fellow students, anywhere,
are to be denied democratic education, then I will
suffer from their ignorance.

I am deeply pained when, in the name of ‘democ-
racy,’ admittedly religious sanctions are applied to
education. It has long been thought that American
freedom was not bound by partisan religious action.
When a speciﬁc religious group rationalizes, in the
name of democracy, any encroachment upon the civil
rights of men, then I ﬁnd it diﬂicult to stand in the
same spot for more than a second at a time. I suspect
that democracy has been laid away for awhile.

The Pamphlet

In a pamphlet setting forth new rules for faculty
tenure at‘ Duquesne, Father Kirk, new president of the
university, has included 16 points which he is stated
in the newspapers .as believing to be necessary for
combatting (1) certain Godless Professors, (2) Com-
munism, that is, Red Atheism, and (3) Fifth Columnists,
who “get boys and girls together for meetings, and
plant the seed of discontent.”

Generally, I need only refer to the last of the 16
points to understand what is going on. Number 16
forbids any professor to “teach any other proposition
inconsistent with Catholic doctrine.” With respect to
certain Godless Professors, I can see clearly the con-
sistency of this ruling in a university of a speciﬁc re-
ligious order.

But Godless Professors do not a Newspaper Story
make. We must believe that these “Communist youth
organizations” which Father Kirk has in mind, but
not in sight, and with respect to naming which “It is
hard to get down to brass tacks . . ” and these un-
heard unseen, almost ghostly Fifth Column meetings
which “plant the seed of discontent”—-we must be-
lieve that these are all a result of that extra piece of
pumpkin pie the night before. For, you see, he offers
no proof whatsoever that they exist, except perhaps
in certain “undercover” portions of his fancy, certain
“subversive” caves under the Bluﬁ.

Ah, Communism

But if we investigate further, we run right into the
“straight-ﬁsted declaration” of Father Kirk, “We are
going to kick the devil out of Communism.” I’m going
to be serious about such a statement despite its hu-
morous implications. Have we not heard exactly these
same words, accompanied by exactly this type of
academic throttling by Hitler, Mussolini, and Stinko
Franco? The New York Times, September 27, referring
to the Spanish Civil war, said, “It is not diﬂicult to
deduce the technique of counter-revolution. It con-
sists of declaring as loudly as possible: ‘Our aims are
to save our beloved country from anarchy and bol-
shevism . . . and from attacks upon religion and the
home.’ Such an appeal has proved ,successful in Italy
and Germany. In reality they are not ﬁghting bol-
shevism at all; they are ﬁghting liberalism.” Here
then, in Pittsburgh, is a parallel.

Oh, Fascism .

Father Kirk also said, and the papers reported, and
there has been no retraction, “By teaching the prin-
ciples of Democracy, we are ﬁghting Communism, as
well as German State Socialism, and SOME elements
in Fascism, which are all anti-christian.” I capital-
ized that SOME. There is where I got suspicious. If
Father Kirk is against some elements of fascism, then
by implication he is also for some elements of fascism.
And when he calls German Fascism, “German State
Socialism,” is he trying to dissociate Italian and Span-
ish Fascism from the Nazis?

This is no time for ambiguous statements about
fascism. We would like to have the word on what
Father Kirk likes and dislikes in fascism.

So far, of course, this analysis has had to do with
Duquesne, not Pitt. But I believe that we can proﬁt
by the mistakes of others, if we analyze them in time.

The 5th Column

Then lastly there is the small matter of Father

~-ur ---u- m,

Kirk and the Fifth Column, that business about shady

meetings and discontent. I don’t want to discuss the
Fifth Column. The President of the United States and
the Department of Justice, believing that they are bet-
ter equipped to deal with Fifth Columns than most

college presidents,.have requested all citizens to go to

sleep. at night and let them take care of the shady
meetings.

f Eiet Father Kirk-disobeys completely the requests
0 e civil authorities and the elected representative
of the people. He embarks on a little witch-hunt all
his own. I do not feel, in View of Father Kirk’s
cloudy-to-say-the-most evidence of Fifth Column ac-
tivity, that he has any right to go over the “heads of
the democratic people in this way. This doesnot only
concern the Duquesne campus. It concerns an of us

The moral to this analysis depends upon the reader.
but a word to the professors at Pitt: Please look td
your rights in this time of restriction. I
is Worth ﬁghting for. And don’t let us students ‘down

Wed like to hear your own propaganda, rather than
somebody else’s.

Lions Seek Final Victory
Here For Unbeaten Season

Bob Higgins’ greatest team in his eleven year regime invades Oak-
land Saturday in an attempt to win the ﬁrst Penn State victory in Pitts-

burgh since 1919.

Scoring a 10-0 upset triumph over the Panthers last

season, the Lions seek to win two games in a row from Pitt. a feat unac-

complished since 1911-12.

Undefeated in seven straight con-
quests, the Nittanyites have mowed
down Bucknell, West Virginia, Le-
high, Temple, South Carolina, and
New York U., and tied Syracuse.
They’ve got most everything——-
speed, power, daring, and deception.

The charge of the Penn Stam

' backs has thundered through for at

least two touchdowns in every en-
counter but the Bucknell clash. Led
by Chuck Peters, veteran senior and
Pepper Petrella, 140-pound climax
runner, the Lions are roaring omin-
ously, for it’s been many a year
since they have relished the sweet-
ness of an undefeated grid cam-
paign.

In addition to Peters and Petrella,
Higgins’ outﬁt contains four other
top—notch backs: Ralph Ventresco,
giant sophomore fullback from Pit-
cairn, steel-ﬁbered Johnny Patrick
from Schenley, Len Krouse, also
from Pittsburgh, and Bill Smaltz,
the only non-Pittsburgh district boy
in the list.

Along with this glittering array

of talent, there are also some ster-

ling linemen. Bearing the sharpest
-claws in this Lion’s forward wall is
center Leon Gajecki who was draft-
ed by the pros last year; he was so
good as a junior they naturally sup-
posed he had three years of experi-
ence. According to communiques
from other Eastern football baili-
wicks, he_’s even better this year.

Saturday Nite

Right in line with all the festivi-
ties of the weekend, the Panther
Club, undergraduate Lettermen’s or-
ganization will celebrate an expect-
ed victory over Penn State with a

gym Saturday night after the game.

Rusty Williams’ orchestra will
“give” with the music. It’s an in-
formal aifair and dancing will con-
tinue from 9 until 1 o’clock.

The crowning glory of the eve-
ning will be the awarding of a foot
ball, autographed by all the mem-
bers of the grid squad. Jack Benz,
BA41, chairman of the event, has
hinted that many of the players are
planning to attend the dance.

Tickets are priced at 75 cents.

President Ernie Bonelli, BA41,
also announces that the club will
hold a business meeting today in
room 24 Cathedral at 1 o’clock.

Of Sports Stuff

Today is the day for the “eeney,
meeney, miney, moe” boys to be
faced with the awful truth. In
other words, the sport staff yogis
are seeing their collective averages
printed in the News for the ﬁrst
time this season. Three of the
geniuses have already bought one
way tickets to Oigevaldia.

Sports Editor McE1wain has the
“distinction” (that ain’t what he
calls it) of leading the pack, picking
37 out of 47 in three weeks of prog-
nosticating. His system is an intri-
cate one but goes something like
this: first he counts the number of
windows in the Cathedral, multi-
plies by the size of the stadium debt,
divides by the velocity of the wind
in “Gone With The,” and then adds
the paper to the junk in the waste-
basket. From here he takes a quick
trip to Mayview, and lo and etc., he
returns with Grantland Rice’s pre-
dictions.

Chaffo, Zelenski, and Reinstein
are the trio of boys behind McEl-
Wain batting’ in the low .700’s.
Each one of them have a good rea-
son for being able to pick them
right. Chaffo has a bald-headed
uncle whose head he uses as a crys-
tal ball. Zelenski attributes his suc-
cess to his trusty pipe. And Rein-
stein knows a man who knows a
man who knows a man.

Football expert Foote’s percent-
age is only .617 but he’s spending
th-e rest of the season just patting
himself on the back for picking
Iowa over Notre Dame last week.
Maxﬁeld has placed an order for
six cases of Wheaties, and ten cases
of Ovaltine. Who knows, maybe
that will do it.

Ripp is blaming his downfall on
his red hair. He doesn’t know that
I-ledy Lamarr is just crazy about red
heads. Last and by all means least
is Bazell. The less said about him,
the better!

 

Spot-its
lMam of the Week

BOB THURBON—Falling under
the blanket of anonymity that con-
sistently dogs Pitt right halfbacks,
Rapid Robert week in and week out
has been a fine performer this year
without getting credit for it. Satur-
day he leaped into the spotlight with
a truly brilliant performance.

The Erie senior ran behind Dick
Cassiano his sophomore, then sub-
bed for Emil Narick last year. As
Narick’s replacement he caught
Eddie J ones’s pass to beat Tech but
otherwise was not outstanding.

In the interval between the 1939
and 1940 season, Bob took unto him-
self a wife, and whether or not the
added responsibilities of being a
husband have helped him, Bobby has
stuck to business and become a
worthy member of the long line of
ﬁne Panther backs.

Repeats IC-4A Cross Country Triumph

Although Pitt co-captain Walter
Sterner ﬁnished sixth, the rest of
the Panther harriers were far out
of the running in the annual
ICAAAA cross country meet at Van
Cortland park, New York, on Mon-
day.

Defending champion Leslie Mac-
Mitchell of New York university
won the meet for the second con-
secutive year after leading all the
way. His nearest opponent was

sophomore Robert Nichols, Rhode
Island State college, who trailed by
400 yards. MacMitchell’s time was
26:03.

Colgate’s Glenn Masten was 100
yards behind Nichols in third place.
Billy Smith of Penn State, who won
the meet in 1938, came in fourth,
and Charles Tingley of Rhode Is-
land State was just ahead of Ster-
ner.

Sterner was the only Panther to
place among the first twenty-ﬁve.

Gridmen Vanquish

Phi Kappa Team, 20-I3

By Ben Foote

Defending titleholder, Phi Gamma
Delta virtually clinched the Inter-
fraternity grid championship in the
1940 title chase Monday afternoon
in a veritable quagmire at Trees
field when the Fijis won a gruelling
20-13 battle from the Phi Kaps.

The muddy going slowed down
the running attack of both outﬁts,
but the Phi Gams rolled on to their
second straight crown in business-
like fashion. Despite the sloppy
pigskin, Fiji Mike Mitchell and Phi
Kap Jack Glenn waged a passing
duel, each ﬁring two touchdown
shots.

Receiving the opening kickoff,
Mitchell and company marched
straight down the ﬁeld in the initial
series of downs to score. Stoney
Bitner tucked one of Mike’s tosses
into his breadbasket for the touch-
down and Warne grabbed another
one for the extra point.

With lightning swiftness, the Phi
Kaps struck back. Glenn, a mem-
ber of two past all-intramural se-
lections, warmed his pitching arm
and laid one down the middle to
Bilowich. Glenn’s conversion at-
tempt ‘failed, and the Fijis held a
7-6 advantage.

Throughout the remainder of the
ﬁrst half, both teams lost scoring
opportunities, a nip-and-tuck strug-
gle ensuing until seconds before the
half ended. The Mitchell-Bitner
combination clicked again, but the
try for the point after touchdown
failed and the whistle blew with the
Phi Gains leading 13-6.

After the intermission, the Wall-
ingford street gang began to dom-
inate the play. Although they lost
several chances to tally, they kept
the Neville street seven bottled up
in their own territory. On fourth
down Glenn dropped back in his
end zone to punt, but Paul Mac-
Neill, rugged Phi Gam lineman,

broke through to block the kick and
fall on the ball. Mitchell passed
to Warne for the one-pointer and
the Phi Gams had stretched their
lead to 20-6.

Phi Gamma Delta then rushed
several reserves into the game, and
Phi Kappa picked up a consolation
touchdown before the game ended
when Dox grabbed a long aerial
from Glenn. John Tyburski, a
thorn in the side of the Fijis all aft-
ernoon, scored a ﬂuke extra point
as he caught Glenn’s bad kick in
the end zone.

Although this clash was originally
scheduled to be the ﬁnale in inter-
fraternity competition, the Phi Gams
will not be oﬁicially awarded the
title until the outcome of six min-
utes of football between the Phi
Kaps and the Sammies is known.

Cot Analyzes
French Army’s
Recent Defeat

European Refugee
Cites Causes of Fall

By Irwin Rosen

Outlining four basic reasons
for the downfall of the French
army, Dr. Pierre Cot, refugee

minister of the late French gov-

ernment told the year’s largest
Pitt Town Meeting audience
Monday that at the inception of the
war, France was prepared to fight—
“but in a war of the 1917 variety.”
Primarily responsible for the mil-
itary defeat of France’ by Germany
was the difference in the military

‘conception of army officials of both

countries, according to Dr. Cot. The
entire military system of Germany
was characterized by youth, vigor,
and the most modern tactics of war,
while Fran.ce’s army was headed by
a group of older, more co nservative,
and less far-sighted men.

“While Germany was centering
her offensive tactics upon the use
of airplanes and tanks,” observed
Dr. Cot, “France was still clinging to
such antiquated war methods as for-
tiﬁed lines.”

Troop Concentration

“Too,” Dr. Cot stated, “the Ger-
man manipulation of troops was far
more skillful than that of the
French. The Nazis had a complete
concentration of troops in north-
western Europe, while France had
her forces scattered along the Al-
pine region, in Northern Italy, and
along the Maginot line.”

“Thus, the actual battle of France
consisted of a hundred German di-
visions against some thirty for the
French.”

According to the former cabinet
minister, when France capitulated
to Germany she had numerous divi-
sions in Northern Africa, which
were practically intact. France’s
decision to surrender, despite the
availibility of these troops, can be
traced only to internal forces.
Four Mistakes

“France’s failure in this war,”
stated Dr. Cot, “can be traced to
four mistakes which she made: (1)
Non-payment of her war debt to
America, (2) Non-support of the
Spanish loyalists, (3) Non—appli-
cation of the oil sanctions of Italy
in the Ethiopian campaign, and (4)
Failure to defy the peace of Munich
and support Czechoslovakia.”

I-lad France supported Czechoslo-
vakia, spurned the Munich agree-
ment, and sought an agreement with
Russia, she would have not entered
this war “without a friend, save
Britain,” according to Dr. Cot.

Then the French statesman told
his audience that another political
reason for the fall of France was
“insufficient unity during the war,
which was due to the treachery of
the Communist party, and the
French upper middle class.”
Communist Agitation

“Up until the Hitler-Stalin pact,
the Communists were agitating
again ‘War, dictatorship, and ap-
peasement;’ yet after the agreement,
the Communists became quiet and
indifferent, and wanted little to do
with the war, labelling it a ‘Capi-
talistic conﬂict.’”

“The Communists were very in-
ﬂuential at the outbreak of the war,”
‘Dr. Cot pointed out, “their member-
ship comprising twenty per cent of
the French population and sixty
per cent of the French workers.”

The French upper middle class,
according to Dr. Cot, actually hailed
lalitler and Mussolini as champions
of 22- system under which they were
their fear of
Cmnmunisin. Socialism. and even
cf social re"‘orms, they supported
Nazism and Fascism.

It was this pro-Facist upper mid-
r?'c> "l.‘.‘SS, that dominated the army.
Y”-‘:>"'“ and Weygand were ardent
f‘rie~'ids of several pro-Fascist news-
paper editors, and it was through
this linking of Fascistic inﬂuence
\*.'i”‘ the army that the surrender
0"‘ T*‘r~~r~.<~. was achieved, according
to the French official.

Inf01*nmtion Room

(‘nn.t~'rm»d from 'na.gc two
the ‘least of its functions is its lost
and found office where some dozen
articles are turned in and claimed
each day. Sending important mess-
ages to students is still another
service. The oﬁice also maintains
a display of books from the Univer-
sity Press, and a sale of post cards
of the nationality rooms.

Last summer some 200 questions
a day were fired at the office. Ques-
tions have ranged from “What build-
ing is this?” to “Where is Plunkett
way?” A large number of questions
concern the height of the Cathe-
dral.

Don’t wonder anymore—go ask
the information office.
