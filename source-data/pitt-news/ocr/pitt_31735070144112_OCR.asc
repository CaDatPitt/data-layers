Jail among safest in state

by Halyse Domencic
Staﬁ’ Wrder

Allegheny County is one of
the safest in the state, according to
one national organization that reviews
correctional facilities

The jail will receive American
Correctional
Accreditation in Pennsylvania at the
group’s conference in Kissimrnee,
Fla,  .

More than 1,500 correctional
facilities have undergone the three-
year accreditation process, which was
offered for the first time in 1978.

“The 1,500 includes prisons, but
there areonly about 147  that have
it, and that’s out of about 3,300 
in the countt‘y,’7 said warden Ramon
Rustin. .

jails, by definition, tend to be run
by local governments, whereas prisons

Aragon’s grandfather invented the art form
of traditional Mexican woodcarvings. Aragon
uses pieces of twisted wood to carve animals
such as anteaters, opossums, lions, frogs and
penguins. Aragon’s wife, Antonia, then paints
the animals in vibrant reds, yellows, blues and

oranges.
“It takes about four to five hours to

complete a wood carving,” said Aragon
through Nutini’s translation. .“And then
another six or seven days to paint. Between
that, wood must lay in the sun to dry out the

water.”

Improving education takes more than money ‘ I

For years, the state of educa-
tion in the United States has been
dismal, as schools throughout the
country struggled with low perfor-
mance rates. These low-perform-
ing schools usually cannot afford
experienced teachers and, as a re-
sult, students suffer academically.

Pittsburgh Public Schools are
hoping to change this.

Linda Lane, deputy super-
intendent of Pittsburgh Public
Schools, said she considers offer-
ing ﬁnancial bonuses to draw more
high-performing teachers to low-
performing schools, according to
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Lane
said she believed that federal grant

funds might be available to sup-
port the plan.

The idea is still in its early stag-
es, and school ofﬁcials have not
yet discussed it with the Pittsburgh
Federation’ of Teachers, but it is
nevertheless a positive initiative.
Low—perforrning schools usually
lack the ﬁnancial means to hire ef-
fective teachers.

This idea comes at a crucial

‘time, when our nation faces the
worst economic crisis since the

Great Depression. A suffering
economy will no doubt give way to
more and more suffering schools.
With a ﬁnancial incentive plan and
a continued and reliable stream of

federal grant money, hopefully this
can be prevented. ‘

Similarly, programs like Teach
for America attract college students
to education professions’ and retain
them, in part solving the problem
of teacher shortages, which is es-
pecially prevalent in urban areas.
But still, this is not a sufﬁcient
overall response to keeping high-
quality teachers. Compensation is
crucial when it comes to recruiting
teachers.

The ﬁnancial incentive plan is
not ﬂawless, however.’ Offering
heftier paychecks is a good idea,
but whether the state or country
has the means to ﬁnance such a

opinions

plan is not so clear.

Bonuses are just the beginning.
More money is obviously not the
only solution. Part of the answer
lies with the, teachers themselves.
Teachers should be  and
motivated to teach at low-per-
forming schools, which are usu-
ally located in urban areas. At such
schools, instructors face a variety

of problems ranging from poverty

to violence. As such, money might _

not be enough of an incentive to
attract teachers. Rather, teachers
should also have an instinctive

‘ desire and eagerness to help im-

prove the ‘state of low-performing

schools.

-Nevertheless, it is reassuring to

Forget Obama, voteKozlowski for president in 2012

by Mark Kozlowski

Co/unz/ubt

My fellow Americans, in an
era where presidential campaigns
kick off far too early for any-
body’s liking, and at a time when
our minds are tuned to the point

of dullness on the topic of elec—'

tions, the time is ripe. My friends,
I submit myself humbly before
you and ask for your support
and votes as I attempt to take the
White House in 2012.

Some might call this brash,
foolish and unconstitutional. My
answer is that this country needs
change, and we must be willing
to put the arbitrary divide of age
behind us. As to the Constitution:
Though I worship the document
and kiss_ the very limestone of
the ‘National Archives in which
it is ensconced (though I cannot
legally kiss the document itself),
I recognize we must View it as
a living, breathing document,
more alivethan certain members
of the Supreme Court.

This .“vital essence” of the
Constitution is what allows us‘to

survive as a republic by, among
other things, allowing the federal
government to save terminally ill
cancer patients from the ravages
of three months of medical mar-
ijuana use by creative reading of
the interstate commerce clause.

I believe'I can be the catalyst
of so much change that Obama
will be a piker by comparison. I
am an utter \‘(/ashington outsider.
My friends, I have only visited
that cesspit of corruption, that
Gomorrah of Government and
Sodom of Scandal on three sep-
arate occasions.

I don’t even have Sen. john
Warner’s, R-Va., autograph, not
to mention Sen. Ted Stevens’, R-
Alaska. I don’t think I even use
Rep. William ]efferson’s, D—La.,
favored brand of _ freezer. I am
not beholden to special interests,
though I do hold general inter-
ests such as bowling.

Some might say I have no ex-
perience. Nonsense. I was a com-
munity organizer, whatever that
means. My community sure was
organized, you bet. Unfortunate-
ly, in my hometown in the north
suburbs of Chicago, it is impos-

sible to see Russia and thereby

V build foreign policy credentials.

But you can see Michigan, Wis-
consin and Indiana from the
Sears Tower. Does that count?
My cabinet would be com-
posed of only the best, brightest,
most qualiﬁed individuals such
as Jim Carrey as vice president,
Steve Martin in the State Depart-

-ment, Chuck Norris in Defense
_and Fred Thompson in Justice.

Many are bound to throw up
their arms at this and say, “But

_Mark, those people are comedi-

ans.” Exactly. I am merely fol-
lowing the precedent of the
Clinton administration. \Who can
forget the standup routines of
Madeline Albright on how Rus-
sia was a good friend of ours or
Janet Reno’s running joke con-
cerning Elian Gonzalez?

Now, to outline my policies:

Taxes: I ﬁrmly support the
tax plan of the man who would
become ,my Treasury Secretary,
Dave Barry. I

Economy: I believe in. eco-
nomic regulation — an awful lot
of it. In response to banks refus-
ing to make stupid loans during

ARTSC/PS 1910/1911 or

this economic crisis, we must
take-steps to force these banks to
make the same stupid loans that
got us into this mess in the first

place. Regulation is the answer. It _

worked brilliantly for the econo-
mies of Cuba, the Soviet Union
and North Korea. Mindless faith
in government. Isn’t that what
America is all about? ,

judicial Philosophy: Iwill ap-
point strict constructionists who
are constitutional humanists ca-
pable of adapting our Consti-
tution to modern times. Think
Antonin Scalia with strong over-
tones of Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
followed by a racy hint of An-
thony Kennedy and a smooth
john Roberts ﬁnish.

Abortion: Heh, heh. Let’s talk
about something else.

War on Terrorism: That’s bet-
ter! I would begin my campaign
against terrorism by ordering
the arrest of that most danger-
ous Muslim, B. Hussein ‘Obama.
Other than that, I would be
tough on terrorism. How tough?
That’s classiﬁed. ,

Guns: As a T—shirt wearer
myself, I support the right to

bare arms. As an environmen-
talist, I support the right to arm
bears. In my ideal world, hunt-
ers, whom I clearly, dearly love,
would be able to “use guns to
protect themselves from bears
in the wilderness. However, city
dwellers would not be able to use
guns to protect themselves from
gangs.

After all, the gangs would
not have guns if we were to ban
them: We all know that the law-
abiding citizenry’ that comprises
these gangs would never think of

A committing a robbery or murder
. with an illegal weapon.

My friends, I believe I can
unify our divided nation, at least
as well as the last two presidents
promised to, in an administration
where hope, change, diversity
and compassion reign along with
respect for rule of law, moral
ﬁber and family values. And so,
with the past behind us, the pres-
ent facing us and the future yet
to come, I urge you, vote Koz in
2012.

Yes We Can! A Benefit for the
Pittsburgh Food Bank

Anti-Flag with Grand" Buffet, Incommunicado
and Girl Fight ‘
November 9m

7 p.m. _
Mr. Smalls Funhouse41Q-821-4447

Music and local activism will come togeth-
er for a greater cause this Sunday at Mr. Smalls
in Millvale.

Local Pittsburgh punk band Anti-Flag will
host a concert in support of the Greater Pitts-
burgh Community Food Bank, whose funds
and supplies have been dwindling in lieu of
the economic crisis sweeping the country.

“The stat that really stuck out to me is
that they have 500,000 pounds of supplies
less than what they had at this time last year,”
said Anti—Flag’s bassist and lead vocalist Chris
Barker, more commonly known as Chris #2.

He said Anti—Flag learned of the problems
the food bank is facing and immediately took
action.

“We caught wind that the food bank was
having troubles and said, ‘What can we do to.
help?

"So we talked to them and found out they
were in need of money, awareness and goods,”
he said. V

From there, Anti—Flag "called Mr. Smalls
to set up the “Yes We Can” beneﬁt concert

 

A 001116

and invited other local bands Grand Buffet,
Incommunicado and Girl Fight.

“It’s exciting to play with bands just from
Pittsburgh, and there’s going to be kids and
people there who are really excited about the
scene and the city and excited to help,” said
Barker.

In an e-mail interview, Jarrod Weeks aka

' Lord Grunge, of Grand Buffet, said, “To be

honest, I’m just really psyched to play with
Anti—Flag,” and he said that it will be an awe-
some show A '

His bandmate Jackson O’Connell-Ba_rlow

. added, “Ra, Yahweh & the Cat in the Hat will

from the show will go directly to the Food

Thetic, which Barker promises will be a mo-
ment of true awkwardness. —

“_[Pat] is unsure about it, but he likes awk-
ward situations. I’m hoping to hook up some
sort of helmet video apparatus to film it and
post it on some random Web site and beﬂies
on_ the wall of the really weird,”‘said Barker
with a laugh. .

Tickets are $5, and doors open at 7 p.m.
for a night of rock for a good cause.

‘Ion Chef’ isn't soft

Gabriella Lukas calls the branding of "Iron Chef" a misunderstanding and hopes to
bring light to fans of the show at her lecture today in Posvar Hall.

by Andres Miguel
Staﬂ Writer

Dr. Gabriella Lukas
"lron Chef Around the World: Japanese Food
Television, Soft Power, and Cultural Globalization”
Friday, Nov. 7
3 p.m.,
3106 \X/V/PH (Anthropoloqy LoL_inc;e)

Most people who know anything about
the hit cooking competition show .=“Iron
Chef” would not be adverse to using ad-
jectives like “quirky,” “exotic” and “trip—
py” to describe the show. l

But Gabriella Lukacs believes that the
usage of these terms in reference to “Iron
Chef” indicates a fundamental misun-
derstanding of the show’s history, inﬂu-
ence and nature — a misunderstanding she
hopes to explain in presenting her criti-
cal essay, “Iron Chef Around the World:
Japanese Food Television, Soft Power,
and Cultural Globalization,” this Friday
afternoon.

According to Lukacs, an assistant pro-
fessor in the department of anthropology

who teaches courses on global cultural
studies and modern Japan, there is an un-
dercurrent in the academic community re-
garding the inﬂuence of shows like “Iron
Chef” on Japan’s boom in popularity in
the mid-’90s.

Many claim that “Iron Chef” and its
brethren assert an inﬂuence known as
“soft power,” a term coined, by Harvard
scholar Joseph S. Nye in a series of books
on international relations.

Soft power is the ability of a nation or
cultural unit to exert inﬂuence over oth-
ers through cultural or ideological means,
rather than “hard,”_which refers to things
such as military force or economic pres-
sure. In essence, attributing soft power to
“Iron Chef” means that it gives Japan in-
ﬂuence through the culture and ideology

‘ the show portrays.

Lukacs disagrees.

“‘Iron Chef’ does not accrue soft pow-
er in the United States, and a look at the
history and nature of how American au-
diences have received it shows why,” she

said.

The Fuji Network created “Iron Chef”
in the early ’90s in the pursuit of revital-
izing the game-show ‘genre._ The show

was then picked up by San Francisco-‘

based multicultural channel KTSF and
from there became a cult hit. Eventually,
the Food Network acquired the show in
an effort to diversify the channel’s lineup
and freshen its image.

From there, it became a well-known
cultural phenomenon, catalyzing the cre-
ation of an American counterpart, “Iron
Chef America.” A

This presents one of ‘ Lukacs’ chief
reasons why.“Iron Chef” cannot assert
soft power for Japan: It was made to be a
niche product even in Japan. Therefore, it
cannot carry the representative cultural or
ideological weight in order to wield Japa-
nese soft power. '

“To wield soft power, a piece of soft-
ware, such as ‘Iron Chef,’ has to be rep-
resentative of the culture [to which it is]
attributing the soft power,” said Lukacs.
“Because ‘Iron Chef’ is appreciated for all
its global characteristics — extravagance,
cosmopolitanism, competition - and not
its ‘exotic’ or ‘outrageous’ nature, which is
what is usually attributed to Japan, there

is no way that the show can assert soft
power for Japan.”

This is the thrust of Lukacs’ other
main argument — that it is the global char-
acter of “Iron Chef” that entices most
American viewers to watch.

Much like Hollywood ——- which Lukacs
believes “has become increasingly global
chiefly because of its desire to appeal to a
global market” — “Iron Chef” carries an

' extravagance and cultural universality that

makes it appeal to viewers worldwide.

what we like about ‘Iron Chef’ to Japan.
And if that’s the case, there’s no.way it
can have any kind of soft power,” said
Lukacs. .

Given all ‘this, why have so many
claimed that “Iron Chef” has soft pow-
er? '

“I understand why many have attribut-
ed soft power to ‘Iron Chef,’/as it is a very
nice way of explaining its inﬂuence. How-
ever, this glosses over the complexities of
how Japanese shows are received abroad
and also reincarnates- a sort of cultural

imperialism, to explain. ]apan’s changing

While an extremely deep and nuanced
subject, Lukacs hopes that those who
come to hear her presentation leave with
at least a better understanding of her
more general points.

understanding of cultural globalization
and the international television trade, and
that transcultural ﬂows are becoming in-

During college football season,
most sports analysts criticize the Big

Then basketball season rolls
around

The Big East Conference is widely
considered the strongest league in the
country,  this season. Some
peoplearegoingas faras to saythatit
might be the strongest league ever

The league has seven teams ranked

surd fourteamsrankedinthe top nine

Leading the way in the polls is
Connecticut at No 2. The Huskies are
closely followed by Louisville at No 3,
Pitt at No 5 and Notre Dame at No
9. A
Marquette falls in at No. 16 and
Georgetown at No 22, and Villanova
rgunds out the Big East teams at No
23. '

Many prognosticators project that
Connecticut will stand on top once the
season is complete The Huskies could
have a monster trio to combat any Big

bit of  and point guard A.].

Panther Women look to

by Emily Steiner
. Smﬁ Writer

Coming off its most‘ successful season
in the history of the school, Pitt’s women’s
basketball team looks to start and end the
2008-09 season with even more ‘broken re-
cords.

The Panthers went to the NCAA Tour-
nament for the first time in 2007 and made
the Sweet 16 for the first time last season,
and this year, head coach Agnus Berenato
wants to take her team even further. » '

“We want to win a national champion-
ship,” said,Berenato. “That’s our goal.”

Pitt‘ lost a key starter inicenter Marcedes

Walker but will return three starters in Xenia _

Stewart, Jania Sims and Shavohte Zellous,
who has been named to the All—Big East

, team twice in the past. Zellous was selected

unanimously to the preseason All—Big East
team, in addition to being a Lindy’s second-
team All—American, making her one of the
top players in the country

“Obviously [Walker] was a great talent,”
said Berenato. “And she really was the per.-

son who put the program on her back. But A

what you do is you just try to reload. We feel
reallyqconﬁdent in our student athletes.” 
‘Returning along with Stewart, Sims 
Zellous are sophomores Taneisha Harri:

Walker’s absence, will be expected to ‘play a
more substantial role at‘ center this season.
.' “Chelsea has experience, that’s her gig,”
said Berenato. “She’s a quick-twitch ath-
lete.”
Joining the team as freshmen are Kate

it’s a mistake and that we just lucked out
last year.”

“We need to work hard and get to where
we need to be,” said Stewart. “We’re going
to take this program where we need to take
it.”

This week, the USA Today/ ESPN poll
was released, and it placed the Panthers

G 23rd overall. In the Associated Press poll,

Pitt was only one spot out of the top 25.
The team is going to face much tougher
opponents in the upcoming season, start-
ing Nov. 16 against No.11 Texas A&M at
the State Farm Tip-Off Classic in Baton

season contest.

Later in the season, Pitt hosts No.,.2

comes to the Petersen Events Center Feb.

Pitt against ranked teams. No. 5 Rutgers
_starts Feb.10, and No. 1 Connecticut starts
Feb. 15.

Sixteen of the 28 teams the Panthers
face this season made last year’s postsea-
son. _ ' T " ‘

“Figure it out, kids — we need 20 wins
to get to the NCAA,” said Berenato. “We
have our work cut out for us.”

Coach: Jamie Dixon

Key Returners: Sam Young,
DeJuan Blair, Levance Fields and
Gilbert Brown

Key Newcomers: Nasir
Robinson, Ashton Gibbs and
Travon Woodall

Player to Watch: Brown

The Story: Pitt looks to break
past the Sweet 16 for the first
time, after four appearances there
in the past seven years. Young
returned to the team after nearly
entering the NBA Draft and is the
team’s best scoring option. Fields’
health is key, as he is currently

‘ _ nursing an injured foot. With

Mike Cook and Ronald Ramon
gone, Brown could.break through
as the team’s most athletic player,
if he is healthy as well.

Coach: Jim Calhoun

Key Returners: Jeff Adrien,

Key Newcomers: Charles
Okwandu and Scottie Haralson
Player to Watch: Kemba Walker
The Story: There might not be
a more talented team in the‘Big
East conference, and that’s saying
something in a league that has
seven teams in the preseason
AP top 25. Even with swingman
Stanley Robinson suspended at
least until January, the Huskies
weigh in at No. - 2 in both
preseason polls and are predicted
by the Big East coaches to capture
the conference.

Coach: Rick Pitino

Key Returners: Terrence

and Andre McGee

Key Newcomers: Sarnardo
Samuels and Jared Swopshire
Player to Watch: Williams

The Story: The Cardinals
reached the Elite Eight last year,
only to lose to North Carolina.

They lost senior David Padgett, ‘

but that’s not stopping anyone
from picking the Cardinals to

‘go to the Final Four. Williams

and Clark could both end up on
the All—Big East team at the end
of the season, and Samuels and

top freshmen in the conference.

The Story: The Irish enter the
season ranked in the preseason
top 10 for the first time since 1980

as hope for the team continues to H

rise. After exceeding expectations
last season, Notre Dame will look

to build on that this upcoming -

season behind reigning Big East
Coach of the Year Mike Brey.

Brey, who is entering his eighth’

season with the Irish, will possess
a nice one—two punch in forward

Harangody, last year’s Big East

Player of the Year, and guard
McAlarney.

Villanova Wildcats

(No. 25 AF, No. 25 USA Today/
ESPN)

Coach: Jay Wright

Key Returners: Scottie Reynolds and
Dante Cunningham

Key Newcomers: Maurice Sutton

Player to Watch: Corey Fisher

The Story: Depth in the frontcourt will
be an issue" for the Wildcats, but that
hasn’t hampered them in the past. Last

. year, Villanova surprised a lot of people

and made it to the Sweet 16. This year,
everyone is back for the Wildcats, and their
guard play will be phenomenal as usual. It’s
scary to think what Scottie Reynolds will be
capable of this year as an upperclassman.

West Virginia Mountaineers

Coach: Bob Huggins A

Key Returners: Joe Mazzulla, Alex Ruoff
and Da’Sean Butler K

Key Newcomers: David Ebanks, Dee A
Proby and Kevin Jones

Player to Watch: Ebanks

The Story: Last year, West Virginia’s
offense was predicated on Joe Alexanderfs
ability to get whatever he wanted
offensively. Alexander left early for the
NBA Draft, leaving the Mountaineers with
major scoring concerns. West Virginia can
defend as well as any team in the Big East,

. and Joe Mazzulla is a solid all-around point

guard, but the Mountaineers will only be

successful if their young talent grows up
quickly and contributes offensively.

Coach: Jim Boeheim

Key Returners: Jonny Flynn, Paul Harris,
Eric Devendorf, Kristof Ongenaet and
Arinze Onuaku

Key Newcomers: Mookie Jones and Kris
Joseph

Player to Watch: Flynn ‘
The Story: Syracuse, which is coming off a
loss in the NIT title game to Massachusetts,
should improve this year. The Orange
were plagued by injuries last season, losing
Devendorf on Dec. 15 for the remainder
of the season with a torn ACL, Andy
Rautins was out the entire season also with
a torn ACL, and senior guard Josh Wright
quit the team in ‘early December. Led by
Flynn, who was co—Big'East Rookie of the
Year along with DeJuan Blair, the Orange
have a good shot to return to the NCAA
Tournament after a two—year absence.

The Story: The Friars enter the new season

step farther. Davis, last year’s AP Coach of

to work with and will most likely look to

The Story: The Blue Demons ﬁnished
11-19 overall and 6-12 in Big East play
last season. Coming back are sophomores
Koshwal and Tucker, who both had good

still the goal. But for the team to make
signiﬁcant improvements, all eyes will be

Rosario is the ﬁrst McDonald’s All-

it’s getting ﬁt ,

“We’re all  each other up out there ev-
ery day,” said Scott Plains, N.]., native and com-

. bo guard Gibbs. “You have to make sure you’re

physically right or the ice bags will come.” .

W/oodall has become more familiar with the
gym and agrees with Gibbs.

. “You have to be at it all the time and can’t let
up,” said Woodall. ,

Constant adjustments, however deﬁned, are
what cloud the experience of the aforemen-
tioned studentathletes. In addition to the leam—
ing on and off the court, much of the educa-
tion for the freslnnen has been internal.

“You’re not ‘The Big Deal’ out here [at Pitt]
like you may have been in high school,” said Ba-
hamas native and forward Miller. “You’re just
one of the many guys, and you have to learn
that, or else.” I ,

At Pitt, being one of the guys is not a bad
thing. The camaraderie developed in the Pan-
thers’ biief stint together has been a pleasant
surprise for head coachjamie Dixon. He’s been
especially impressed with how the freshmen

‘have consistently and incrementally been pick-

,ringthinesup-

Robinson, a Chester, Pa, native, has appre-
ciated the team’s developing chemistiry.

‘‘\We’re all getting along good,” he said. “It
deﬁnitely makes  easier.”

The biggest thrill for him has been the ex-

. penence of playing for the vociferous Oakland

Zoo.

“It’s a feeling like none other, really,” said C

Robinson. “It makes you want to work hard

. out there and compete and deliver a win for the

fans.”
All four freshmen have been able to enjoy

' life outside of the court and classroom and ex-

perience what Pitt offers, academics aside.
‘_‘The scenery around here is really great,’.’
said Miller. “There are trees all around and hills,

too. I have to get used to those hills, but I love
the city.” -

Miller, a self—proclaimed poet and  is
most impressed with his impersonation skills

“I’ve just always been able to pick up on all
kinds of people’s voices,” he said with a 

Miller is proud of the athletic-academic bal-
ance at Pitt, particularly with Pitt’s undergradu-
ate College of Business Adminisnation, where
Millefs learning his networking skills

On the other end of the spectrum is Gibbs,
who devotes much of his free time to his re-
ligion, which has helped put basketball in its
proper perspective for the high-impact guard.

“It’s _always been an important part of my
life,” said Gibbs. “It was passed on to me by
mom, and I’ve always carried it with me.”

Gibbs is a great fan of gospel music, but he
won’t compete with Miller in a karaoke contest
anytime soon. He’s “too laid back and chill” for
that. . ’
' Often, family support is taken for granted

among students, but \X/oodall falls nowhere-

near that category. He keeps in constant con-
tact with his mother, even though he lives states
away from her while at Pitt.

“We talk every night now —— every night,”
said Woodall “I never‘would’ve guessed that I’d
become a mama’s boy.” "

The sentimentality shared with Woodaﬂ
and his mother is indicative of the relationship
these ﬁeshmen have built with one another. On
the court, the fun and games are off and -the
physicality perseveres, sometimes with bleeding
results. But it’s the embracing of that very sac-
riﬁce that makes Travon \X/oodall, Nasir Rob-
inson, Ashton Gibbs and Dwight Miller who
they are

And while the results will be shown on the
court for all to see, in the meantime,  per Ra-

, mon’s sage advice, it will be all about the work

when no one’s around looking.
Here’s looking at you, kids.

bowl berth with Win

by Alex Oltmarms
Staff IV/iter

In this ever—changing up-and-down sea-
son for the Pitt football team, the Panthers
seem to be back on the upswing again.
Coming off a thrilling, four—overtime win
at Notre Dame, the team appears to be

However, some of these young players,
such as freshmen Andrew Taglianetti and
Myles Caragein, are starting to improve.

Their improvement has not gone unno—-

“Myles deserves to play,” said \X/annst—
edt. “His play—ratio is as high as any defen-
sive lineman. With Tommie Duhart being

Pitt coach Dave Wannstedt believes that .

Louisville poses a similar matchup to last
week against the Fighting Irish.

“Louisville does some things on offense
and defense that are similar to what Notre
Dame did,” said W/annstedt at his weekly

press conference. “We needed a little bit of .

a carryover, as opposed to preparing for
a triple-option at Navy to a pro-attack at
Rutgers.”

Part of the Panthers’ inconsistency can

“He’s getting more and more playing
time every week," said Warmstedt of Bald-
win. “Sometimes, he’s drawing three guys
towards him, which is nice because‘ now
you put him on the ﬁeld and it gives us an
opportunity to exploit some other options.
You wouldn’t think that three or four games
into your freshman year you’d be drawing
that kind of attention, but he is.”

The Panthers hope to maintain their
level of improvement this week as a dan-
gerous Louisville team comes to town.

Cantwell dangerous passer for Cardinals

cuse, Wannstedt knows they pose a serious
threat. ,

“They have a lot of skill and speed on
their football team,” said Wannstedt. “They
have good athletes at every position. This
will be a big challenge for us.” A

Maybe the best of all these athletes is
freshman halfback Victor Anderson. An-
derson, a Lousiville native, ran 23 times for
113 yards and a touchdown in last week’s
loss. '

“[Anderson] makes a lot of guys miss,”
said Wannstedt. “He’s got exceptional
speed, and he’s a lot stronger than what
you might ﬁrst anticipate. He’s a very

good back. He can play for anybody in our
conference — there’s no question about'
“that.”

When the Cardinals aren’t running the
ball, they turn to senior quarterback Hunt-
er Cantwell to make plays through the air.
Cantwell passed for 214 yards with two
touchdowns and an interception last week
against Syracuse. -

On the defensive side of the ball,
Wannstedt said he believes that Louisville’s
most improved position is its defensive
line. Senior defensive tackles Earl Heyman
and Adrian Grady lead that line. -A

This game is the first in a critical four-

it’s pretty clear to everybody that the whole
conference is up for grabs,” said Wannst-
edt. “However we play in this last-month

looked at the schedule, and everybody is

Panthers win the next four games, they
will win the Big East and gain a BCS bowl
berth.
