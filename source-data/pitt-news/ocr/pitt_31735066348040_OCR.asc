Several Black Studies Faculty
members charged‘ last week that
Black Studies chairman candidate
Curtiss Porter is not the Search
Committee’s leading contende-r
and, “does not have the support of
students, faculty and community as
"people are led to believe.”

It was reported in the September
24 F'itt News that Porter was the
front runner in the year-long search

 for a permanent head of the black
 studies department.
“Although Porter did get more
faculty votes than any of the other
three,” explained Dr. Emmanuel

Anise,” more individuals voted for.

Dr. Constance Achononu of Wash-
ington State University.”
“Each. Black Studies faculty
member had four votes. A majority
, of the members split their votes
— among the four candidates,”
explained Richard Blackett, “but a
small faction cast all their votes for
‘Porter. This included Porter
himself who was permitted to vote.
This was how Porter got more votes
but Achononu got more individual
support.”

“Placed within context Porter has
been as assistant professor for less
than a year and will be getting his
PhD in January,” stated Anise.
“This should not make him
underqualified for the job. But
there are eight other people like
him in the department plus others
who have had PhDs since 1970.
Why have these other people been

eliminated?’ ’

Faculty member Rollo Turner
added, “There were ‘four major
criteria used to reduce-the 200
applications. The candidate had to
be a scholar-activist,‘ demonstrate
administrative competence in get-
ting funds, be experienced with
urban black institutions and have a
knowledge of the development of
Pitt’s black studies department.
This last qualiﬁcation eliminated
most people far from the Univer-
sity, people the Search ‘Committee
were originally looking for.”

“The original intent -of the Search
Committee was to find an outside
candidate for the job. Because of a
departmental crisis in the summer
of 1973 resultingin the resignation
of Fela Sowande, interim depart-
ment head, the department ,' has
been ‘split along two factions. The
committee determined that no one
from within the department could
unite the faculty but only cause
more bitterness and fractionaliza-
tion. So the committee decided
they wanted an outsider.”

Along with Porter and Achononu
other candidates under final
consideration were Dr. Rollen
Smith, assistant professor at

Carnegie-Mellon and Dr. Mervin-

Williams, interim Anthropology‘
department chairman at Carlow
College. “Achononu and the

others are three well qualified

black Americans,” said Anise.
“Students have been misled by

State Schools Face Unification

’ BY SUSAN MANNELLA -

A State Senate bill which would

combine Pennsylvania's,‘state-
owned colleges into one university
has produced mixed reactions by
some university administrators,

although state-related Pitt would

not be directly affected by the bill.
“To the extent that the proposed
Commonwealth University will im-

prove utilization of existing institu-
' tions, we support it,” said Pitt Vice

Chancellor of Planning and Budget
Jack. E. Freeman, “However, we
are worried that the bill may result
in widespread expansion in these
schools.” Senate Bill 1743 would
combine schools like Endinboro,
Clarion, Bloomsburg and eleven

V others into one large state-owned

university system.

Although the schools would be
expanded to include" graduate,
professional and research program,
Freeman feared they would not be
maintained at the levels of Pitt,
Penn State and Temple.

“The public prestige of the 14
colleges will be improved and it will
make some of them more attractive
to students,” Freeman said, “But
we wouldn’t view the university as
a competitor for state funds or for
students.” _

The Bill is anattempt to co-
ordiante offerings of 14 state-
ownegl schools so “each of them
wuld emphasize certain? programs
and others would not duplicate

  Porter's Standing Contested A SU Annex Concert Bani
Sparks Boycott Threat 

BY BILL HADUCK

The Student Union Annex re-
mained closed for entertainment
purposes last weekend as repre-
sentatives from Student Govern-
ment pondered their next move in
the attempt to reopen the facility.

Pittsburgh Department of Public
Safety closed the Annex to concerts
and related events last week after
Oakland Development Inc, [ODIJ a
citizen’s group, claimed entertain-
ment in the Annex leads to trouble
in the streets.

"We're probably going to write
all the businesses in Oakland and
tell them we want their support,"
said Student Government Board
(SUB) member Bruce Keeler. “If
they don't give it to us, we'll
initiate a selective boycott.

“Departments of Education will

be maintained at all the schools,’
but programs which .draw fewer
students will be reduced," Ringler

_said. “For example, about seven

schools offer library science pro-
grams and we would pare it down
to two or three."

The university would be governed
by a Board /of Regents and a
chancellor and would operate like
Pitt’s branch campus system, ac-
cording to Ringler. Unlike Pitt and
other state-related schools, this
state-owned university system
would be under the govemor’s
jurisdiction.

Ringler said, “The re-organiza-
tion will begin either next Septem-

- her or during the 1976-77 academic

year, depending of when the State
House takes action. I think, as of
this moment, its chances look very
good."

State representative’ James A..
Romanelli (D-Pittsburgh) did not
echo Ringler’s confidence in the

' bill. “From what I know of the bill.

now, ldon't think it's a good idea.
It would be a conglomerate and the‘
individual universities could lose"
their identity."

The bill is now in the Senate
Education Committee for debate,
and according to Russell M.
Arnold, Assistant Vice Chancellor
for‘;Governrnent- Relations, “There
will be open hearings on the bill
and possibly some changes in it
before it goes to’ the House -for a

“We'll also have petitions out by‘:

to openithe place up again. We'll "
send them down to either City -
Council or 0Dl. ' i.

“As far as going before city-
council with the problem, we really 
don't know where to start.” p

SG Allocations committee mern-‘Z
ber Bill Barker, who had been close
td the controversy, agreed. “There '
is no way we should go to City‘
Council right now. There're a 7'

ed only about 300 registrants,
Nelson said, attributing the rise to
“increased political awareness a-
mong students, particularly the
incoming freshman class.”

She also said the passing of
Watergate possibly had a hand in
the doubled figures. “Students are
becoming more interested in polit-
ical reform and party reform," and
they realize the only way to get
something done is to vote.”

A party breakdown of the regis-
tration is: Democratic, 440; Re-
publican, 105; Independent, 53;
and Constitutional, 1.

Pitt College Young Republicans
(CYR) President Doug Yauger ex-
plained the Democratic runaway.
“Most of the students come from
Middle middle class or upper
middle class and usually those
levels. have gone Democratic.

University against the community
because the community will win."

Apparently some of the problem,

lies in interpretation of the ground
rules for the use of the building.
"The University and ODI made
verbal commitments about the
whole thing," Barker said. “They
agreed the Annex would be used as
a commuter lounge and a meeting
hall. What the University meant to
imply was that it would also be
used for coffee houses and small
scale entertainment.”

‘An occupancy permit filed with
the General State Authority says
the Annex would serve as a
“government structure for use by

University of Pittsburgh Office of '

Student Affairs and students, fa-
culty, staff as a lounge.”

tainment ban at the Annex, SG

okay, but we're still planning some
sort of reaction to the whole thing.

weeks in January.

"Will the hearings conclude in-
January? Who know. Maybe if we
are lucky.
These hearings could
go on for another year,” Lawrence
said. ‘

Lawrence is pleased Pitt’s admin-
istration is finally producing wit-
nesses to speak on the academic
structure of the University.

“They have been trying to show
that the University is one entity in
terms of business, one entity in
terms of building, one entity in
terms of finance. But his does not
make up a collective bargaining
unit," Lawrence said. “We have
to determine whether all faculty
have a community of interest with’
each other. Whether the medical
school has a community of interest
with the other faculty in the
University."

Lawrence added that if the bear-

Allocations vs. Homecoming

BY TOM SMITH

Editor’s Note: [This is the fourth of
a series of articles on the Student
Government Allocations
Committee].

When the Student Government
Homecoming Committee
submitted its budget last June,
Homecoming representatives, es-
pecially chairperson Janet Toth,
were terrorized by members of the
Allocations Committee during a
series of unnecessarily rude inter-
views.

Not only did? the Allocations,

Committee attempt to substitute
their judgement for that of the
Homecoming Committee in the
scheduling of specific events for
the week, but they almost forced

and would have been happy with-

the resignation of Janet Toth.
Toth, a former member of the
Student Government Board did not
seek reelection to the post last
winter in order to assume the
chairmanship of the, Homecoming
Committee.» Her qualifications for
the position are clearly impeccable.
More experienced than most of
the Allocations Committee mem-

‘bers because of her past involve-

ment in Student Government, she
was more" than aware of the
allocations processes. Yet, the
committee heldzher and the concept
of Homecoming up for scorn as
Toth was ridiculed during inter-
views with the committee and was
insulted by committee members at
public Student Government Board
meetings.

But, not only did the committee
seek to intimidate her by ‘making
rude comments‘ during allocations
interviews, it seems as if the
committee allowed this obvious
personality clash to affect their
recommendations for the Home-
coming budget.‘

-First, the Allocations Committee
refused to fund a mixer scheduled
for the Syria Mosque. The
committee objected to this because
beer was to be served and it is not
the policy of the Allocations
Committee to fund refreshments.
Yet, the committee ignored the fact

_ that an admission fee of one dollar ‘
was to be charged making the

event practically self sustaining.
And even though the Home-

coming Committee made special

arrangements to abide by the age

Good Politician and an

were by the professionals, they‘ go
back with dashed hopes to the
latter, and are robbed again.

What, ‘then, can be done to clear
up this noxious miasma which
permeates our’ political system?
Nothing, reaily.

Our democratic, capitalistic sys-

tem is too much a fertile ground for
bamboozling at the hands of the
finest public servants it will ever be
ourprivilege to know. Nor, does
there exist anacccptable substitute
for our inherently corruptscheme
so we must make do with what we
have.

I

-restrictions of the Pennsylvania

Liquor Control Board as mandated
by the Student Affairs Office, and
the cost to Student Government for
the event would have been
minimal, the Allocations Com-
mittee religiously and blindly
adhering to their guidelines
refused to fund an event that would
have attracted more than 1000
people during Homecoming Week.
As this incident indicated, the
committee too often quotes by-laws
and guidelines, even though it is
within their jurisdiction to make
exceptions to those guidelines
whenever the best interests of the
Pitt student body would be served.
Unfortunately, the Allocations
Committee did not realize this was
clearly one of those instances._
Secondly, until last week the
Allocations Committee had been
objecting to the scheduling of a
non-competitive student Talent
Night. This would have been the

first year for the event, but the

committee obstinately opposed the
location of the Talent Night, which
was to be Carnegie Music Hall.
The Allocations Committee wanted
the event to be held in an on
campus facility ignoring the fact
that no facilities adequate for the
staging of such an event are
available.

As they did during Pitt News

contract negotiations, the com-
mittee seemed once again to be

objecting to a concept that was
new, original, and progressive.
Finally last week, the Allocations
Committee agreed to sanction the
scheduling of a talent night at the
YM & WHA, also considered an off
campus facility by the committee
even though several classes are
scheduled in the building.

Throughout this series the Alloca-
tions Committee has been des-
cribed as being extremely petty,
and perhaps, the best example of
this involves the Homecoming
Committee.

A monetary prize, the Blue Gold
Award, is annually given to a Pitt
student for outstanding service and
contribution to the Pitt community.
The award is not subsidized by
Student Government, but is instead
donated by Iron City Beer.
year Iron City increased its
donation to $300 and for that gift
the company asks Student Govern-
ment to print a certificate of merit

opportunist, but between two obvi-
ous opportunists, the one perhaps
excelling at beautiful and mean-
ingless words and the other at quiet
yet shady deeds.

lt would, at the very least, make
for a candid and invigorating
atmosphere. The voter would select
his candidate in the knowledge of
all the facts -- free of any delusions
about the politicos.

The selection would be made in
much the same way as a ‘person
chooses between two brands of

. gum or two cuts of meat, instead of

judging a man's integrity on the
basis of a balmy political platform.

Obviously, such blunt honesty in
c:1mpaigii_s would not prevent cor-

‘fuption within America's demo-
cratic system, but at least it would
mitigate the fraud which we now
tolerate and even accept as a
necessary part of politics. We don't

This '

need it, so ‘why do we expect our ,-

      

  Political Terrorism in SC  

to complement the award.
Expenses for printing the certi-
ﬁcate are $25.

The Allocations Committee could
not comprehend paying for the
printing of a certiﬁcate for an
award ﬁnanced by a private
corporation. And afterall, accord-
ing to the committee, the award
was administered by the University
and not the Homecoming Com-
mittee. Allocations told Home-
coming to seek these funds instead
form the Chancellor’s Office, the
alumni, or the Student Activities

Office.
Yet, it is the responsibility of the

Homecoming Committee to present ,

the award, and not the University.

Student Government should be
more than willing to minimally
fund a program honoring student
contribution to the community, bun
instead the Allocations Committee
decided to engage once again in
their political pressure tactics
strategy, but this time for only $25.

Finally, the Allocations Com-
mittee failed to realize the
Homecoming Committee required
financial ﬂexibility to properly
organize the events of Home-
coming Week. In an attempt.to
ridiculously structure the Home-
coming budget, the Allocations

‘Committee initially recommended

a reduction of $8000 in the
Homecoming appropriation.

Though, Homecoming is only a
month away, the Allocations
Committee did not see fit to ﬁnalize
the Homecoming subsidy until last
week. There can be no sign of

greater irresponsibility on the part

of the Allocations Committee.

Homecoming is traditionally the
most prestigious social event of the
University calendar honoring not
only returning alumni, but also
paying tribute to those students,
faculty, and administrators, who
currently comprise the University
community. To allow the success
of Homecoming to be endangered,
as the Allocations Committee has
done, is an insult not only to all

those participiating in Home- ‘

coming, and to the University as an

institution, but is a dereliction of

duty unprecedented in Student

Government in recent years.

Serving In tersts

Of Black Studies Castration
  Pa. Abortion Bill

Dear Editor;

The Pitt administration should
promptly accept the nomination of
Curtis Porter as chairperson of the
black studies department. This is
because Curtis Porter, out of
hundreds of applicants for the job,
received the endorsement of both
the black faculty and the Black
Action Society. ‘The Young Social-
ist Alliance supports the democra-
tic right of black control of the black
studies department, including/the
right to choose its chairperson. Any
delay or interference by the Pitt
administration in this matter is a
denial of that right.

The BAS is circulating a petition
in support of the nomination of
Curtiss Porter. The YSA supports
the BAS and the black faculty in
their choice of the person who can
best serve their interests as chair-
person of the black studies depart-
ment. '

Black Control of Black Studies
Pitt Young Socialist Alliance
Paulette Spence

Bill Waddell

and

To the Edtior:

Many hysterical men have ac-
cused women (especially feminists)
of being castrating; however, real-
ity is very ‘different, as is verified
by the recent passage (over the
veto of Governor Shapp) of Senate
Bill 1318. the anti-abortion bill.

This is an attempt to restrict and
punish the sexual activity of wo-
men. Is’ this not—really and
truly—a form of castration?

A woman, in order to beequal
with men, must have the same
freedom of use of her body as men
have. She must be free to utilize
her body for her own pleasure,
ratherthat at the discretion of and
for the pleasure of others, men.

How isit then, that a legislative
body of men has had the audacity
to take upon itself the control of

women's bodies. No comparable
group of women deigns so to
control men’s bodies.

Inasmuch as women have always‘
been accused of being castrating, I
suggest that this myth be made
"reality, and that all Pennsylvania
state legislators who voted for
passage of Senate Bill 1318 be
castrated, in order that their stupi-
dities will not be perpetuated.

«Sincerely,
Karen Marsden

Pitt Football And
Dorm Security

, Dear Editor,

The University of Pittsburgh, in
itsclimb to the top of the charts in
Sports Illustrated football polls, has
caused the administration to make
some misguided allocations. In
doing so, the health and welfare of
the _students residing on campus
has, perhaps, been jeopardized. 1
am referring to the article appear-
ing in the Pitt News (9/20/74)
concerning the cancellation of the
24 hour security in the dormitories.

Likewise, cuts in some federal
expenditures, as well as some sort
of relief for lower-income groups
are_ most likely to occur.

But regardless of what decisions
are reached by Ford’s new
Economic Policy Board as an
outgrowth of the 12 presummit
meetings and the ﬁnal summit
conference this past weekend, most
economists agree upon one thing:
They forsee a still higher rate of
inﬂation with little economic groth
over the next several years. But
many of them also share Marina
Whitman's optimism in that we will
not “reincarnate the 1930's."

'Pitt News: With Watergate and
the presidential resignation over,
we have all suddenly been -made
aware of the spiraling inflation
facing us. Can you pinpoint any
reasons as to. how this inﬂation
occurred?

Whitman: The truth is no one
fully understands what caused it.
Many economists have theories,
but none of them are claiming that
they have a deﬁnite answer to that
question.

I can pinpoint a few reasons that
have contributed to the situation,
however. One is a coincidental
cyclical boom where all of the
business cycles of the major
industrialized countries have
reached a peak concurrently.
Another cause is the agricultural
production lag experienced in the
US this year, and a third reason is

from various political differences
which created a split on the
summit's first day, special inter-
ests seemed to pull in different
directions.
And while the President does not
want price wage controls, but
advocates cutting the federal bud-
get as a means to curb inﬂation,
Senate Majority Leader Mike
Mansﬁeld, a democrat from Mon-
tana, disagreed, favoring the op-
posite. .But Meany, on the other
hand, said labor is strongly op-
1 posed to wage-price controlsand
was, furthermore, against cuts in
the budget, ‘for fear of lost jobs and
higher unemployment.

the price of oil forced upon us by
the oil cartel, as well as higher
prices on other raw materials. And
ﬁnally, the devaluation of the dollar
played a role in the problem.

Pitt News: Can we blame any of
this inﬂationary growth on Nixon-
omics?

Whitman: As a member of the
policy-making staff during the
Nixon Administration, 1 can hon-
estly say that certain policies may
have contributed to alleviate
inﬂationary growth, but nothing
could have been done at the time to
avoid the situation.

Pitt News: Can you be a bit more
specific?

Whitman: US policymakers have
always had problems in measuring
capacity utilization. If this could
have been determined more
precisely. we could have become
less expansionary, helping to ease
the rate of inﬂation.

Pitt News: The pre-summit
meetings with President Ford--
what were some of the issues
discussed and what were some of
the solutions offered to solve our
economic woes?

Whitman: The meeting was more
a coming together of economists to
put their ideas together. The major
discussion revolved around a one
by one explanation of what went
wrong with policy-making instru-
ments, but no new proposals were
offered. nor any great new ideas.
_There was also a heavy concern
with self-protectioniand a looking
out for everyone’s own economic
interests. I think that the meeting

economy and also served as an

serve as his chief economic policy
drafting body. In addition, Ford
announced the creation of the
White House Labor Management
Committee, which is’ designed to
give the President input on matters
concerning productivity, a crucial
factor in inﬂation. .

Ford also appointed Princeton
economist Albert Rees to head the
legislatively formed Council on
Wage Price Stability.

"But nobody know better than I
that councils and committees can-
not win this war. The most

against inﬂation is the spirit of the

promised, “and work every bit as

weekend, until every American is

The President also announced in
an address closing the conference
that he intends to present toithe
Congress in 10 days his recom-
mendations to begin the healing
process for the nation's economic
wounds.

At the summit’s conclusion, there
were several areas of general
agreement. Most important among
these areas was the concensus that
cutting the Federal budget would
not do very much immediately to
reduce the rate of inflation.

Other signiﬁcant areas, outlined
by The New York Times, were:

--T here should be tax relief for low

Getting Into Education “the Better Way

BY BILL MOORE

"How are your classes?"

“I don’t have any.”

"C'mon! Don't put me on. What
classes you got?"

“Really! I don’t. I’m in AC.”

"Huh?"

“Alternative Curriculum. lt.’s a
special program. ,I’m taking all my
15 credits in it. We have discus-

i sions and workshops and stuff like

that, but no classes. We're on our
own to learn however we see fit.”

“Hey, listen, I wasn’t born yes-
terday. I know when someone is
putting me on. If you can’t give me
a straight anwser to a simple
question then just bug off. I don't
give a damn what classes you have
anyway."

The 130 freshmen enrolled in the

.Alternative Curriculum (AC) pro-

gram last year know how often this
type of dialogue took place. The 40

- or so freshmen who have opted to

enroll in AC this year are finding
out.

The AC program operates out of

an abandoned classroom in the Old
Dental Clinic on the southeast
corner of O’Hara and Thackeray
Streets. It is open to any freshman
willing to sacrifice the security of
an age-old institution for the free-
dom of independent study.

"We are trying to develop a

situation under which students can

discover their own power of learn-
ing for themselves," says Dave

Bramhall, of the economics depart-
ment and director of this year's
AC. “We are trying to teach
cooperation, not competition.’'

.In Alternative Curriculum a stu-
dent has very few guidelines to
follow. An AC student is required
to learn a body of material and, by
the end of ther term, illustrate what

~ he has learned to one or more of the

AC faculty. The whole processisf
called “evaluations.” Most AC
students compile four evaluations

per term.

‘Tom O'Donnell, an AC undergra-
duate teaching assistant an past
AC student, sums up his views on
standard education by saying, us-
“There

has got to be a better way!"

The AC program will be that
"better way" if he, Dave Bramhall,
a dedicated group of past and
present AC faculty, students and

have suggested. “I’m trying .to be
a resource person for the group by
getting students together who have
similar interests and finding re-
source people in the field they want
to investigate,” explains O'Don-
nell.

The key work is “cooperation.”

They have lots of help. Bramhall
is pleased with the numerous
responses the program has receiv-
ed from University professors ask-
ed whether they would like in some
way to aid the program. Non-AC
faculty play an integral part in the
workings of the program, hot by
quest-lecturing and serving as
resource persons for AC students.

Thanks to these faculty members
and the AC professors, students

Irene Kugler, a student in this
year’s AC program, is learning to

studying the philosophy of law. 'She
is also enrolled in one standard

Kugler, who plans a career in law,

says she is pleased with AC
because “it make your look at
education for what you can get out
of it, not for the mark or as
something you have to do. It is nice
to be excited about learning.”

She _learned about the program;

during freshman orientation, but
was almost steered away from the
special course by a critical advisor.
“My advisor tried to talk us out of
taking AC. When I finally got
around to telling her I was enrolling
in AC anyway, even after her
speech against it, she sent me
down the hall to talk to a different
advisor," she explained.

The low enrollment this year, 40
students compared to last- year’s
120, may be due to the advisors
who have inﬂuenced interested
freshmen to avoid AC.

BY ED HOLLIN

A major problem with profes-
_ sional schools is their willingness to
respond to the professions they

-according to John Funari, who
I ecame dean of the Graduate
‘School of Public and International
"Affairs (GSPIA) September 1.

,, “Schools such as GSPIA should
ijlead, not respond to what the
;profession thinks they need--we
‘fought to be the burr in the saddle,”
,Funari said.

“.‘-A fundamental function of

‘professions. We ought to lead.
This ‘is our responsiblity, and
:;perhaps our prime one, not to
?become instruments of the profes-
-visions outside.”

.- Funari claimed GSPIA enjoys an
excellent reputation around the
nation among similar schools, but
iiis not generally well known in its
own backyard.at Pitt, especiallly
among undergraduates.

7 “Schools of public affairs tend to
;be' a bit isolated because the
subject matter tend to be outside
the universities themselves.
Faculty members have professional
orientation and often work in
government.

 “I want to try to correct that
situation by much’ closer coopera-
tion and a reintegration with other
departments of the University,
especially in the social sciences,

more consultation.”

Funari recognized no problems
unique to GSPIA which weren't
plaguing similar schools, but said
of the field in general, “We’ve
been through 25 years of social
experimentation. We need to
pause deeply for minutes and ask
ourselves about preparation for
professional managers of social
change.

“There may be too much
specialization in the sense that we
should be concerned about what we
are doing as well as how we do it;
about the idea that one insight can
solve all our problems. We need to
train people to have a broad
understanding of the world.

“For example, where one builds a
housing project is a political
decision, it involves people, it is not
just an engineering decision.

“As changes are implemented we
ought to think about human
aspects, which are political pro-
blems. not technological.

In dealing with these problems at
the academic level, Funari sug-
gested “preventing compartmen-
talization.” We can also review
and revise curriculum, which does
not have as much cohesion and
central focus as it should, in my
judgement.

“We need specialists and experts,
but their specialization has to rest
upon a broader view of the society
they're working with.
example, a plumber should be
familiar with the whole system, not

just a particular piece of pipe.”

Funari left the University in 1962
after serving on the GSPIA staff
and as assistant to the dean of the
School of Liberal Arts. He
described the atmosphere here
when he returned as one of
“enormous vitality."

“I don’t find as much hand-
wringing here as I’ve felt has been
so characteristic of American
society,” the dean said. “There’s
a feeling problems can be
handled.”

GSPIA's strengths, according to
Funari, are in its faculty and an
“interested and involved student
body, as well its tradition. After
only 16 years, the school has
achieved a major signiﬁcant place
among others in the country."

GSPlA’s enrollment did not
decrease as expected this year, but
remained about the same as
1973--an equivalent time total of
387 students.

“One heard that activism was
gone,”, Funari said, “that young
people were no longer interested,
but that’s ‘obviously not so.”

What made a young student in'the
late 40’s lean toward government
service, an inclination which would
see him later work in Latin
America, the Near East and South
Asia with the State Department's
Agency for International Develop-
ment'(AID)?

“It seemed to me American
society was not living up to its
ideals,” Funari said. “Things I

Sydney Harris recently wrote a column which, for once, was rather

interesting. Sharp, original thinking and attractive word use was once ,

again lacking, but, it was interesting.

Harris simply pointed out that there’s a lot of crying in reﬂection of
the fact that only one of every ﬁve Broadway productions is a success
when in truth for the -arts, one-out-of-ﬁve is a high percentage of
success. He backed this up by writing “a book publisher is fortunate if
one volume out of 50 makes a great deal of money.” if

"I understand that there are thousands of reasons for failure in both
areas, theatre production and publishing. Willaim Goldman in his The
Season raises so many possibilities in term of Broadway failure, that
pinpointing one of many solutions soon becomes an absurd task. I can
only trust the similarities to the publishing business are great.

BUT, my eyes and heart ﬁnd crying over publisher’s failures very
difficult. The reasoning? The unsellable trash they print. Now there’s
nothing wrong with good filthy, rotten. pornography, after all,
publishing is a business, and orgasmic scum like that sells. And of
course, I don’t label any publication whose philosophies I strongly
disagree with as trash, I instead just yell and scream about it, glad
there are several sides to every story being printed.

But it’s the waste of paper, time and personal insult that hurts when
as editor, I’m mailed for review, stuff like Indecent Exposure by Susan
Quist. F ., '

Indecent Exposure may be one of the strangest I’ve ever run into,
dirty, poorly written, it stagnates between porno and written English,
failing to succeed on either level. The publisher insists the novel is
“distinguished by its painful insights, its exhilarating pace, and its
total lack of sentiment.” Could be, because it’s painful to the human‘
mind to read such waste, the pace maybe because the entire book is
literally, a bouncing ball from back seat to bed to bed, and also lacking
because of its obvious message. 

The‘ message?-parents and society mess up child’s mind so she fucks
till blue in the face then comes up with the amazing discovery that
there’s something wrong with her life and writes a book. I can only
guess that the ﬁnal bounce of the ball came to rest in the publisher’s
bed, how else it got published eludes me. ' 6

Exposure is one of many, the publishers print them, send them to me
and are amazed when I ignore them in favor of Solzhenitsyn. There are
a few saving graces to Exposure, one being that if totally drunk, it’s
hilarious. The other being Quist’s description of Pitt, one of two
schools she attended before realizing that a total dedicatipn to balling
is better than classes. Quist on Pitt: My boyfriend, who lives across
the hall, has a pretty sixteen-year-old chick in his pad tonight and I can
hear them balling. And he won’t answer the door. Do you suppose it’s
all because they (her parents) let me go to that lousy fucking school?

‘American Review 21 edited by
Theodore Solotaroff Bantam Books:
‘$1.95 [paperback], 273 pages
It’s reassuring to see America’s
mass circulation paperback literary
magazine is still producing good
reading after seven years and 21
issues.

blished as New American Review
[NAR] in 1967, partially intended to
be a successor to New World
Writing. This was the best known
 of several paperback literary
magazines in the 1950's and in 17
issues published works by authors
such as’ Joseph Heller, Eugene
= lonesco and Thomas Pynchon, all
grealtively unknown at the time.
,,Pynchon’s “Lowlands” in NWW
16 is lighter and less complicated
than his gargantuan novels. Like
_ all of Pynchon’s early stories, it's
‘ ‘worth reading.
if The first issue of New American
_ -Review appeared in late 1967 and
, included a section of Philip Roth’s
v _ Portnoyls Complaint')19b9) and .
Faith Paley's great “Faith :In A
Tree". perhaps the finest story in
_ her 1974 collection Enormous
 Changes at the Last Minute. A
high proportion of essays and the
_..focus on American writing and

,American Review was first pu-.

subjects differentiated NAR from
its predecessor.

Early issues of the NAR featured
many piecesl still find rewarding
and entertaining. RobertCoover's
“The Cat in the Hat for President,‘
a section from Kate Millett‘s
Sexual Politics which appeared the
year before the book came out, and
Stanley Kauffmann’s film reviews.
A section from Alan Friedman's
Hermaphrodeity (1972) appeared
in 1968. Jane Jacobs on the cities.
Stories by William Gass, Leonard
Michael, Donald Barthelme and
Joseph McElroy. I loooked forward
to the early issues of NAR for
exciting writing by known and
unknown authors, but I lost track of
NAR as the writing became
increasingly esoteric and less
moving. ‘

After not reading it for a couple of
years, I’m pleased to find the last
few issues contain pieces as good
as the early issues.

Some things have changed. New
American Review is now American
Review. It’s on its third publisher
and now includes ads. Recent
issues now contain works from
other countries, increasing AR’s
eclecticism. Poems still seem to be
shoved in as breathing spaces
between the essays and stories.

be inserted to hide the fact that he
didn't read the bok,” the percep-
tive reader concludes. Well, l’ll
confess I didn't readeverything in
AR 21 and I didn't like everything I
did read.

For me, AR is more important as a
continuing entity, not an individual
issue and I recommend it confi-
dently to anyone who likes modern
writing. To me, not liking all the
writing reflects AR’s strength and
diversity, not weakness.

If you insist, I'll tell you
something about AR 21. I. L.
Doctorow’s “The Pyramid Club” is
a great story that describes a
fictitious meeting between Henry
Ford and J. Pierpont Morgan.
Doctorow uses terse writing packed
with details to explore what editor
Solotaroff calls “the myths that
underlie our realities and the
realities that underlie our myths.”

An illustration of Doctorow’s style
describes Fords reaction to his first
successful assembly line:

“...he experienced an ecstasy
greater and more intense than that
vouchsafed to any American before
him, not excepting Thomas Jef-
ferson. He had caused a machine
to replicate iself endlessly. His
executives and managers and

assistants crowded around him to
shake his hand. Tears were in their .
eyes. He allotted 60 seconds on his
pocket watch for a display of
sentiment. Then he sent everyone

     
     
   
   

back to work.” Only the use of the
phrase “out of sight” mars
Doctorow’s spare, readable, fact-
crammed prose.‘

“The Pyramid Club” like “Rag—
time” in AR 20 is from a novel in
progress. Doctorow is a good
example of the selective wisdom of
AR’s editors. Doctorow had a story
in NAR #2 before he was so
well-known. Several years later he
achieved noteriety with his novel
The Book of Daniel. ‘ --

What else is in AR 21, you want t
know. There’s a long story by
essayist, filmmaker and novelist,
Susan Sontag. Mexican Carlos
Fuentes examines the relationship
between the West and writers from
countries like Mexico and Poland
which are lesser in inﬂuence. John
H. Schaar and Francis M. Carney
examine Watergate and blame
both the public and the government
for disregarding “the promises and
goals of the Republic.” Two
stories by Bohumil Hrabal, author
of Closely Watched ‘Trains, who

New “American Review" Delivers Quality Pieces

has not been published in his
native Czechoslavakia since 1968.
AR 21 also includes poems by two
college undergraduates. ,

A comment on the poetry. Most
of the poems I read were down to
earth and close to prose.
Sometimes this detracted from
their effectiveness; however I like
Stanley Moss’ three poems on
“Vital Functions.” They are about
vomit, shit [Tears ofshit drip from

a man who cannot cry.”] and snot.

[“Dogsieat it, nobody ges rich on
it.”] And there’s Edward Field on
‘ ‘Roaches. ” i

I liked Lynn Chong's Sestina from
A Line in a Bergman Film.” She
effectively explores a moment in a
Bergman ﬁlm Shame, I think in her
first piece published in a national
magazine.

So don’t yell at me for not reading
the whole thing. Go out and get a
copy ofAR 21, shut up, find a nice
quiet place to. read and you’ll
probably like the book.

SPORTS EDITOR

Half chewing, half ‘smoking his usual post game cigar, the white
haired King of/the Southern Cal Trojans sat calmly and authoritatively

.lIIlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllIllIIlllllllllllllllllllllllli

 ﬁelding questions from a group of reporters.

John McKay, the USC coach for 14 years, the man that has taken his
team to the Rose Bowl six of the last eight years, whose teams have
finished in the Top Ten nine times, was mildly arrogant.

lt didn't matter that the 1974 Trojans, a team McKay has called
"perhaps the greatest team he's ever coached," had been upset by
Arkansas two weeks before and barely escaped a similar fate Saturday
at the hands of the Pitt Panthers.

If you haven’t checked the statistics, you’ll find that the Trojans’

A offense gave the Panther defense a 45 minute workout that Pitt

handled through the third quarter.
“l’d say Pitt compares very favorably with Arkansas on both offense

 "and defense," McKay said. “We just had the ball so much it was just

too hard on them. The teams that got tired out there were our offense
and Pitts defense. A ‘

“A lot of their youngsters got hurt,” McKay said, trying to recollect,
‘'1 saw a lot of them go off the ﬁeld, but I can’t say if they came back."

Sure, you have to land the Pitt defense for sticking it out and giving up
just 1.6 points, but give the real credit the Trojans’ offense for the
difference between the 450 yards they gained and the mere two
touchdowns and a fieldgoal they scored. Four fumbles, two when the
Trojans were marching for the goal line, and over a 100 yards in
penalties did help the Pitt cause, undoubtedly.

It could very well have been a blessing in disguise for McKay when

- Kelcy Daviston sent USC quarterback Pat Haden out totanswer the

phone for the rest of the game. Vince Evans filled in adequately but,

5 for Pitt, the mistake-prone Haden of 1974 couldn't have done much

better. _

“We could have used Pat in the third quarter." McKay said, “but we
were driving the ball so well I didn't want to risk it. We didn't want to
pass that much going into the game. Pitt used the same defense as
Arkansas, showing us 70,000 different setups. You've passed too
much when the other team knows you're going to pass."

The Panther offense, which ran the ball for barely 15 minutes of the
game, did not have ample opportunity to motivate any kind of scoring
threat other than the 45 yard drive setup by Mike Bulino’s interception
in the second quarter.

“We're used to seeing Tony Dorsett," McKay laughed, “because we
face Anthony Davis and Allen Carter every day. We knew Pitt wasn’t
going to be any kind of a threat passing. You can’t pass effectively
when you can’t run the ball and we weren't worried about Pitt running
through us. They couldn't, and that let us play our linebackers back
some. If they would have. we'd have moved them up and then opened
up the secondary more.”

For a man whose team handed away its season opener and had
handed away its second game, only to find their opponents incapable of
accepting it, McKay seemed quite snug. One look around his locker
room after the game and you could easily tell why.

McKay is surrounded by what could easily be a pro team, with a year
or so to mature. His recruiting program brings in the type of football
players Pitt has yet to see; the 250-260 pound lineman, a runner like
' Carter to back up Davis, and a defense that takes the pass away from a
team by taking away the run. '

“We forgot about a national championship at Little Rock," McKay
said before the Pitt contest. But after the game he asked, “What was

BY G. w. STEVENS
Associate Sports Editor

The Pitt Panthers led the USC
Trojans for over three quarters
Saturday afternoon in a game in
which Southern Cal did just about
all they could to hand Pitt a big
upset victory. But after controlling
the ball for nearly the entire game,
the Trojans ﬁnally settled down in
the fourth quarter scoring 13 points
to take a much deserved 16-7
victory.

At the end of the third quarter Pitt
led by a 7-3 score although USC’s
awesome running attack held the
ball for all but about 10 minutes out
of the 45 played. Four Trojan
turnovers, three fumbles and one
interception had stopped USC from
getting into the endzone, 'with the
interception setting up the lone Pitt
touchdown.

Late in the first quarter, Trojan
Quarterback Pat Haden dropped
back to pass from his own 30 yard
line and threw over the middle to
split-end John McKay. However,
Pitt monster back, Mike Bulino,
was right there to pull down his
first interception of the season on
the USC 45.

On the very next play Tony
Dorsett, who was held to just 59
yards on 15 carries by the rugged

Trojan Defense, bolted over left
guard for an exciting 23 yard run
breaking Marshall Goldberg's all-
After
Bruce Murphy cut through the
middle for 11 yards and Dorsett hit
the middle for three more, Pitt
quarterback Billy Daniels passed
up the middle to a waiting Karl
Farmer for a nine-yard touchdown
and a 7-3 lead.

Pitt’s ‘ 45 yard touchdown drive
was the only serious attack the
offense could 'muster against the
devastating Trojan defense. They
were able to manage only five first
downs in the entire game and most
of the afternoon was dedicated to a
struggle between the Trojan
offense and the Pitt defense". '

Pitt took the opening kick-off and
went virtually nowhere, ﬁnally
punting the ball to the USC 31. The
Trojans began to move the ball on
the round with Anthony Davis,
Allen Carter. and Dave Farmer
bulling their way for four and five
yard pick-ups down to the Pitt six
yard line and a first down. But the
Pitt defense got tough, ﬁrst hitting
Carter for a loss of one and then
sacking Haden for a loss of seven.

After Haden gained six yards by

The question is: can a team be
happy with a tie?

Well, if it’s the Pitt soccer team
coming off a demoralizing 7-1
defeat at the hands of West
Chester one week ago, and if their
adversary Saturday was an Edin-
boro club that thrashed Coach Leo
Bemis’ squad last year by six goals,

look better and better.

little Chris Limahelu to attempt a
ﬁeld-goal from the Pitt 15. The 5-5
130 pound native of Covina, CA
boomed the kick through the
up-rights for the first score of the
game.

Although the Panthers came back
to take the lead, the offense
remained dormant throughout the
first half. USC started another
drive in the middle of the second
period with some key penalties to
Pitt keeping the attack alive after
Haden had failed to complete a
couple of passes.

The Trojans drove to the Pitt 25
where a holding penalty set them
back 15 to the 40. Haden then
completed a pass-like lateral to
Davisfor a gain of four and 14-yard
aerial to Diggs to move to _the Pitt

keeper, the Pitt defense toughened
and stopped Haden’s sneak on
fourth and one.

after getting to the 10 yard line
Evans lost the ball again when he
fumbled the snap and Don Parrish
dived on the football.

But the Panther’s luck ran out in
the fourth quarter. USC held the
ball for so long they just had to put
it in the endzone. Davis capped a
63-yard drive, and broke two school
records, with six minutes gone in
the fourth quarter as he plunged
into the endzone from two yards
out. With a successful try for the
extra point, USC led 10-7.

The Pitt offense got three more
ghances to move the ball but they
were unable to get anything going.

plays later when Evans coughed it

to Karl Farmer who was streaking
down the sideline. The ball was
thrown well but USC’s Danny
Reece did an outstanding job on the
coverage and pulled in an
interception on the USC 22.

The Trojans drove again for an
insurance touchdown. Evans was

able to hang, onto the ball this
time and finally rolled left for 13
yards and the touchdown. The
extra point kick went wide and the
score was set at 16-7.

The Pitt defense had played well
but they were beaten by a powerful
team. The Panthers suffered a
tragic blow in the fourth quarter
when Bulino was helped off the
field with a cracked ankle which
will keep him out of action for a
month. The offense was also
beaten badly as the big Trojan
defense held them to less then 100

‘yards rushing on just 28 plays.

Women’s T emiis

Pitt women's tennis team lost
their season opener to West Vir-
gmia last week 5-0. The team lost
all live matches, although two went
into tiebreakers, Pitt eventually
losing them 7-6.

“West Virginia is a well exper-
ienced club,” coach Willa Bentley
said. "We have done no recruiting
and all the girls on the team have
comejust from the campus. Butwe
do have a good representation.”

lhe 12 members of the team
started playing together September
l0 and had to be ready for the
Slippery Rock Invitational (subse-
quently rained out) on the 21st.
Because there were only 12 girls
who came out for the team there
were no cuts made. Bentley
blames the limited roster on the
tact that few knew there was
women's tennis team. 4

“Few of the girls have had any
tournament play," Bentley said,
"and we are literally building from
scratch. Many of them are just
becoming acquainted with the fun-
damentals of the game."

Saturday's game against Bethany
was rained out, and they play
Slippery Rock, away, today.

what affects me,” he said.

His team did him quite well.
Opening good holes in a Panther
defense that would bend but no

plenty of room to do his thing, and
he showed that he deserved his
All-American ratings, although as
even Davis himself will tell you, so
does Dorsett.

“This will'be something I'll never
forget," said Davis, referring‘ to
the big showdown between himself ,
and Dorsett. “But Tony wasn’t in
good ﬁeld position.” '

I "l've been playing longer than
Tony, but I really respect him,”
continued Davis. “I wanna see him
when he’s a senior. He has the
potential to become one of the
greatest backs of alltime.

“Pitt’s offense is centered around

-Tony, and defenses are going to

key on him.”

Gilliam, who led the NFL in
passing yards going into the na-

' eight completions in 31 attempts by

the Oakland defense, ranked No. 1
against the pass.

Oakland, which boosted its record-
to 2-1, did all the scoring in the first
half with thehelp of two long punt
returns by Ron Smith and a pass
interception by safety George At-
kinson.

Smith's first punt return, a 47
yard sideline jaunt, gave Oakland a
first down at the Pittsburgh 28 on

very frustrating to him to be
contained so well. “The defense
was playing so well, you wanted to
do something to get them a rest,”
he said. -

‘‘I expected to have a better
game," he added. “I was never so
loose and ready to go."

But wherever Dorsett went, a
swarm of Trojans followed.

“You can run but you sure can’t
hide," he lamented. _

TD and AD met each other on the
ﬁeld after the game. “He told me
to keep my head up, that I was still
the bad mother,” said Dorsett.
“He also said that I look just like
Flip Wilson and that I should come
out to Los Angeles and be on his
show.” A

Following an exchange of “good
luck for the rest of the season,” the
two parted.

Pittsburgh, which fell to 1-1-1,
then drove to the Oakland 18 yard

penalties before Roy Gerela’s 36

On the third play of the second
quarter, Atkinson intercepted a
