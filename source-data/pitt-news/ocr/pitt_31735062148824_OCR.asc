Inan artistic and impressive man-
ner, the ceremony tries to stress the
ideals that are taught at the Uni-
versity. The ceremony is given a
semi-1'eli.gious approach by Alma
l\'Iater, Glenda Fitch, 40. who pre-
cedes at the coronation as a similar

British ceremony.

‘Dorothy Dering, senior queen of
l930 will yield her crown to Mary
Gregg in the ceremony. Also, at
least eight or ten of the former
queens will be present.

Purpose of the ceremony is to
glorify and honor all the senior

l940 will participate in the cere-
mony: 76 hold special parts.

‘t«W.}l_'.i:~i.L on senior
gift by ,lF.iIl@ 5%

Charles J. Connick, stained glass
z'«.rt.ist who designed the windows in
the , Heinz Chapel, has promised
completion of the Senior Memorial
by June 5.

Informed by Dr. John Weber, sec-
retary of the University, Tom Hal-
loran, BA, chairman of the senior
memorial committee, revealed to-
day the probable date of the com-
pletion of the medallion casement
windows, senior gift to the Uni-
versity.

Plans for the dedication ceremon-
iesc will begin immediately, prom-
ises I-Ialloran.

The two-fold campaign of the
committee consists of mailing
pledge cards to seniors and person-
al contact by the committee mem-
bers, who are prominent leaders
on campus.

Seniors who have misplaced their
cards may obtain additional ones
from the dean of men’s oﬁice, 809
Cathedral. _

According to Halloran, contribu-
tions have been more nuniernuﬁ
than in previous years, but the
g1*eatie‘st‘?i'ap0rt-top of wthe money. is
yet  be ‘subscribed. A

The senior memorial, two medal-
lion casement windows located in
the alcove overlooking Lilly Court,
was chosen because it met the re-
quirements of “something perma-
nent, not too expensive, and some-
thing that could be ﬁnished before
commencement.”

Holhrook, Shaw head;
annual freshman camp

Heads for the freshman camp,
September 20 to 22 will be Al-
len Holbrook, E41, who will serve
as camp’ manager and Robert Shaw,
Ed-11, who will act asprogram man-
ager.

A. luncheon will be held today in
the Y club rooms at 12:30 o’clock
to discuss camp plans.

Second semester brings little excitement

By Betty Schloellerl
..A quick glance over the News

.- ﬁles stamps this lastsemester as a

comparatively quiet chapter in "Pitt
history. - ' V
Pittites went_to dances, dedicated

n,'ationality-rooms, fought over elec-

tions, and gamboled through Spring
Festival... week in the usual manner.
There .was no intense excitement;
neither were there any meteoric
personalities.

However, the recent proposal. for
student hospitalization insurance
co-sponsored by the Student Health
Service and the News undoubtedly
deserves recognition not only as the
outstanding news story of the semes-
ter but as the most beneficial un-
dertaking of the whole school year.
Running a close second for import-
ance to life at the University was
the reorganization of the faculty
council early in March.

Feature events were plentiful; the
production of “Dido and Aeneas,”
ﬁrst student opera at the University,
probably rating ﬁrst in the eyes of
the intellectuals with the long-de-
layed opening of the Kathedral
Kitchenette receiving the vote of
our Tuck Shop society.

Chronologically, the semester ran
something like this:

VVe say an revoir
but not goodbye

Graoing collegiate papers from the Vermont
Cynic to California Daily Bruin are farewell edi-
torials spouting eyeshade philosophy to prospective
edito'rs.»and encouragement to graduates. There is
about these columns a kind of “God help you re-
maining next year and best luck to us who are
leaving the cloistered college for the W'orld.”

These words are not for us. In the ﬁrst place
we are not leaving. The fond farewells we have
left to those who are cleaning out desk drawers
after four years of beating deadlines and dragging
copy to the printers. We refer you to three col-
umns on the next page.

The seniors try to sum up the past year’s work
as well as to say goodbye. Some twenty-ﬁve days
ago one Bob Adams, erstwhile editor of the News,
summed. up the season ’s work and keynoted some
ideas and‘. ideals” for the new writers to transform
from mind to print. ‘We refer you to the ﬁles.

The record for the past years, however, was not
sealed with Bob’s words. \Ve have just received
word about this work of the old staff that every-
one‘ at the University should know. The Associ-
ated Collegiate Press, in judging the News for the
first semester under Bob and Morty VVeissman,
ga.ve‘”’7the~“’News 810 points out a possible 1000, over
100 points higher than the News rating for the
past two years.

The ﬁgures are just a bit of concrete evidence
of the really good job that Bob and Morty, along
with ot.l1er~.«seniors,-liave donep We referyou once
again to the ﬁles.

So it’s so-long to the seniors.

And, with F.D.R., to the rest of you we say,
“VVe’ll be back in the fall if there isn’t a war.”

A commentary
on \Varlines

The number of Warlines responses was very dis-

appointing. Out of a possible 5,000 replies only 12
were received. Only one was from a faculty
member.

Generally several points stand out. First, few
backed‘ their opinions with facts. -Most were pri-
marily concerned with the surface manifestation--
the war—of what intellectuals and scientists be-
lieve a tremenduous reorientation of society. Some
considered America’s position through the per-
spective.;of.Europe rather than Europe through the
perspective of America.

A breakdown of opinions follows:
_i ,’l‘hre-e believe the~Al.lies will win (and that
 this is desirable) if given enough aid by the
- U. S. -
Six believe the Germans will win (most if
1 aid is not given by U. S.). a
T No one states frankly that the U. S. ‘should
- send men to Europe, although several opin-
ions, if logically carried out, would lead to
I ’ this conclusion. ,
Three approve and three disapprove eco-
_; nomic participation in the war.
' i  Nostatements straighftforwardly approve 
 IS. spending for arniaments, although there is
 "plenty of implication. _
,‘ "l’jli‘rpe;i11,al:e America. dependeiit upon Europe.
”  Four believe G-ermanyﬂwill eventually invade
America if they win the war.

,-.—4.u.<u-....-_u-_L-....-. .... x,-._......._—*.,_._.._.._..._ _-... . .. _
'‘ ~ *;.....«s_ ... ....  .

“ ,0:pi_nions were split almost" evenly on all the
major points. Few direct. statements of what
America should do to keep out of war were made.
.I=ufplic‘a'tior1 was the chief instrument of most stu-
dents in voicing their opinions. And facts were few
and far b,e‘twee11. .

Several criticisms of the opinions can be made:

it 1. There has been no indication i.n the papers

or» journals that the Allies have exhausted their
war credits in this country or that they have
dr>irnand.ed as much armaments from the U. S. as
they could have.

2.. W e have been givingvery deﬁnite economic
aid?-tovthe Allies since ‘the’ beginning of the war.

.  Parallels between \Vorld “far I and W. W.

II at'et‘d‘&l]Tgi'«eI=0uS,“ since -conditions <'-are never-the
saine, although logically the new war may appear
to be but a continuation of the ﬁrst.

4.. Limited economic intervention can turn into
in? l ijtary in tervent ion.

- l)u.ring the summer America will be the scene
of 'i7T?['lf'l'i'l.i.‘ pressures and propagandas. American
sti.zr.’leti’ts are an actual factor in keeping America
out of WE‘) For they will ﬁght if we do get in; and
‘tiiiaisa who fight must be willing or everything

Another interventionist
for ‘full economic aid’

“Full economic aid must be rendered to the Allies.”
I agree wholeheartedly with W.L.K. in last Monday’s
issue of the News.

We must face the facts or the facts will soon face
us. In the first place, according to reliable public
opinion polls, the people of the United States are not
neutral. We never have been neutral. The great ma-

jority of all nationalities are praying for a victory for "

the Allies. Our way of life is that of England  France,
and that is what is at stake in this war. If those prin-
ciples of government fall then we will be the last De-
mocracy in the world.

With enemies of our fundamental set--up of govern-
ment all about us, we can’t afford to sit with our
thumb in our mouth and proclaim our neutrality. The
late Senator Borah shortly before he died wrote a. long
article on how this country was going to keep out of
the war. He based his arguments on the fact that the
Scandanavian countries have proclaimed their 'ne:ut:ral~-
ity and will thus avert being drawn into the war on
either side.

Senator Borah did not live to see his prediction dis-
proven by Adolf, the ‘madman’ of the Century.

Also in last Monday’s issue of the News N. W. would
like to know who the bogey man is? He states “I am
curious though to see what will be considered a threat
to our ‘science, our culture, and our freedom’.” Well
if “bogey man” Adolf succeeds in beating England and
France and if the Armistice demands the handing " over
of the great British Navy. or else a continental attack on
the British Isles, then N. W. will know what’s meant
by “a threat to our science, our culture, and our
freedom.” The dictators are co-operating in their lust
and greed for power. The democratic nations of the
World are disunited and unprepared and thus “we the
people” will suffer in the end.—J. W. K., (342.

Qﬂispassionate’ observer for

limited intervention in war

The proposition “American Youth and the War”
should not have an emotional approach on the horrors
of war. We are all more or less cognizant of these
horrors, but we are all more or less familiar with the
present situation which is said to endanger our country.

American youth should attempt to arrive at a per-
sonal decision as to how the best interests of the coun-
try can best be protected; whether it is best to inter-
vene in some way or another, whether to wait and arm,
whether to remain neutrally impassive. The solution
to the problem of what is best for the United States
should be and can be approached with a minimum of
emotionalism and a maximum of intelligent, dispas-
sionate thought.

For myself, I am convinced that we would be in
grave physical and idealogical dangers should Germany
emerge triumphant in a few weeks or months. A long
war should certainly exhaust even a victorious Ger-
many; a short war would ﬁnd Germany tremendously
strengthened. ’ '

Believing that a short war is in the offing, I think
the United States should not be content with “iiefen-
sive arming” undertaken with the View that we will
ﬁght Germany when the Allies are forced to give up.
“Intervention short of manpower,” which the Allies
do not need now, would, in the long run, result in the
cheapest and safest procedure for America.

If we enter into limited intervention now, we shall
buttress a-reeling France and England. A

If we wait, we will ﬁght alone, and Germany will
not be our only enemy.—-—I. R. K., C41. ‘

Cites text to show how '
president can involve us

Today, most‘ people agree that our President, Frank-

" lin D. Roosevelt, has practically dictatorial powers.

This is “especially true concerning hisicontrol of our
country’s foreign relations. ‘ In spite of this knowledge,
much alarm arises each time the President‘ condemns
the actions/of an aggressor nation oroﬁcrs so strong “a
sympathy to the Allies. The cry is that he is assum-
ing too much power and will surely lead us into war.
Therefore, I think that the following excerpts from’
Ogg and Ray’s “Introduction to American Government”

‘should make clear just how much any president may do

simply because of his position. Perhaps I should also
mention that this material was written before the
present World war occurred. It was not writen to
clear President Roosevelt’s conscience for his so—called
“precipitous” actions.

The following quotes are intended to form a broad
outline which may apply to the powers of any president
of the United States. A ‘

“More than most nations, the United States re-
frains from commitments in advance asto what course
it will pursue in any particular contingency. Never-
theless, our experience, in common with that of other

nations, shows that, regardless of how earnestly a gov- -

ernment strives to keep its hands free to deal with in-
ternational situations as they arise, it inevitably de-

velops viewpoints, principles, and traditions -that even- -

tuate in generally accepted “foreign policies.” The de-
termination of such policies is, of ‘course, in our coun-
try, not the function of any one branch or department
of government alone . . The supreme maker of our
foreign policy is, nevertheless, the president; even when
not strictly the author of a given policy, he commonly
becomes such, to all intents and purposes, by declaring
it to the world and taking the necessary steps to put
it into effect.

“. . . When a foreign complication arises, or a new
international problem presents itself, it is the president
who has the ﬁrst opportunity to say what the attitude
of the nation shall be; and by the stand which he takes
he can so put the country on record that it will be
next to impossible for Congress, or even a succeeding
president, to assume a different position. HE MAY
EVEN LEAD THE NATION INTO WAR: FOR AL-
THOUGH HE CANNOT DECLARE WAR. HE CAN
ADOPT AN ATTITUDE OR CREATE A SITUATION,
E. G.——BY LANDING ARMED FORCES TO PRO-
TECT UNITED STATES CITIZENS IN A FOREIGN
COUNTRY, THAT MAY MAKE WAR UNAVOIDA-
BLE.”—H. U., C43.

Sees no danger .. . . in vtrsar

Today America is not in danger of war. Today
America is in danger of getting war hysteria. This
preparedness bombshell that the president has thrown
in the public’s midst is causing too much excitement
and fear. America is not facing a crisis.-G. II. 11., C40.

Graduate assistants

A ghost from the past-
goal posts again

Editor, The Pitt News:

Last fall when a group of pa-
triots rescued the purloined goal
posts from the hands of the ban-
dals across the hollow, we were
persuaded by the SFA (committee
of one Pat Cusick) to turn them
over to him for the promotion of
the annual Pitt-Tech trophy award.
Right now we wish that we had
cut them up into six inch lengths
and given them out to fellow pa-
triots, because we are bitterly dis-
appointed at the manner that the
SFA has carried out their end of
the agreement to have the posts
mounted in the proper way. When
Tech obtained the aforementioned
posts, they had them on display on
the following day. When SFA got
them, the posts were whisked away
to oblivion or some other place
where no one can glory in their
possession. It may seem pretty

Betty Jane Macqueen had planned
the annual senior banquet for June

Swan song . . . adieu, adieu, adieu

With tears in her eyes, Gert says farewell

By Gertrude Lieblich

June in the Pitt News office
brings forth two complaints: the
West jsn’t wild any more, and the
News will never be the same after
all the senior staff members leave.
We’ve never been farther west
than East Liverpool, O., but here
are the seniors who won”: be the
same anymore.

Adams gets ﬁrst place on our list.

Dottie Cleland has held down
more jobs on the News and around
school than she can remember. She
can do just about everything, and
do it well. Nancy Welfer, who pals
around with Dottie, is a keen think-
er and a scholar in the true sense
of the word. As long as Nancy’s
around, people don’t bother going
to the dictionary.

Mildred Caplan and Edna Kauff-
man, with their friendliness and
good humor, kept the humanitarian
spirit alive in the News ofﬁce, es-
pecially on the copy desk staff
which, by tradition, has a blue pen-
cil in place of a heart.

A senior staff member types her ‘30’

By Mildred Caplan

Today we typed—-30—on this last
issue of the year’s Pitt News. For
 few of us this was the end, not
only for a year’s work but of four
years of tracking down celebrities
and hounding the administration.

The News has given us many
things. We have a book of clip-
pings, we have torn stockings and
broken ﬁngernails, but-best of all
we have memories.

We can remember classes we cut
 sit in the office just to talk.
We remember parties at South
Park, and publications banquets.
We can recall afternoons at the
printers’ and six o’clock deadlines.
For News reporters, who eat more
meals in the tuck shop than any
other students, home to dinner is
a futile dream.

We’ve followed the News from
the eighth ﬂoor to the thirteenth

and back down to the eighth again.
We’ve dedicated almost all of the
nationalities rooms, and we’ve seen
the huge Commons Room become a
reality.

There have been exciting times
and dull times. The exciting ones
mad.e the dull ones bearable. Once
we had a strike which gave us an
air of importance. All the other
students kept asking us out about
it, and we puffed out our chests
and explained that we we-re strik-
ing for fairness and freedom of the
press although most of us weren’t
sure what it was all about.

We played Romeo and Juliet one
night on the Bigelow Blvd. balcony.
We dance in the Commons Room
and sang Christmas carols. We al-
so have the dubious distinction of
being the ﬁrst actress to play a fall-
en woman under the Commons
Room pillars.

come through with quantity right
before a deadline.

No more will Kim Margolis and
Marcella Levin have to stay late on
the copy desk. Kim, with her
themes to grade, and Marcella, with
her ads to sell, spent long hard
hours counting obstinate heads.

Lil Clark, the personal ads edi-
tor, has also been called “the friend
of the people” for recovering car-
load lots of lost watches, fountain
pens, fraternity pins, etc. Those
specialty writers, Joe and Frank
Kristufek, were so good that they
could even scoop the Tuck Shop on
gossip.

‘Well, there are the people we’ve
gone through school with. All of
them have had printer’s ink in their
blood, the feel of power in their
ﬁngertips, and ideas in their heads.
its been a lot of fun to know them
and to pal around with them. These
have been wonderful years.

We cut exams to interview Heif-
etz and Walter Huston. Most of
our interviews were never printed,
and we had a tough job explaining
to the prof that we really were at
an interview.

We went to concerts in saddle
shoes because we got passes. We
also went to movies on Annie Oak-
lies. And best of all we danced at
school affairs on tickets offered to
the editor for good publicity.

There is a new staff coming in.
We hope that they have as much
fun as we had. We hope they work
as hard as we have and that they
make the News the activity it de-
serves to be. We give them our
blessings. We’ll miss them and
each other. But we’ll be back be-
cause jobs are hard to get, and we
aren’t as cynical as we pretend.

So long, and keep the presses
rolling. '

Soliloquy of a senior . . .. . on evalntingﬁ college

By George Hyde

Some year when spring comes
’round again the graduate of 1940
will have time and be better able
to look back at his four years of
life at Pitt. Then he will know
what college really meant. He
can’t know now. He is too close to
those four years to get the proper
perspective. It is like standing too
close to a painting. The colors
blur and the lines areindistinct.
But when one steps back, the colors
form true patterns and the lines
have meaning.

In the present -chaotic state of the
world, it is hardly worth while for
a senior to take time to get the old
ideals out of some hidden recess
and revalue them. Does it matter
if what he intended to get out of
college and what.‘ he actually got
are two different things?‘ Does it
matter now that the classrooms
were not plastered? Does it mat-
ter now that he led a dance or
made a touchdown? No. .

Mixed up with thoughts of term
papers, ﬁnal exams, and instruc-
tions for the graduation ceremony
are other more important questions.
Will he get a job? Can America
keep out of the war? Soon the
senior enters a transitional period,
in which he will try to get settled
in new pursuits and work. But
now all is confusion.

After these few years have fol-
lowed this June, the senior will re-
call the college years, and then it
will be a clear picture. The talk
with the dean, the afternoon at a
“ﬁreside chat,” a prayer in the
chapel may have more value and
signiﬁcance then. He may remem-
ber a phrase from a professor’s

lecture, or the part he had in a
play, or the ﬁrst time he looked
into a microscope, or an A theme.
He may behappy that college
taught him to appreciate a good
book or -how to get along with peo-

ple. Whatever it may be is not
important now." The important
thing is that some day in the fu-
ture he will be able to form his
own evaluation of what college
really meant in his life.

Carnegie library demands
return of all overdue books

Return overdue books to Carne-
gie library immediately or expect a
little conference in either the office
of the dean of men or dean of wo-
men—that’s what Corley warns.

After a conference with Herman
Sayenga, investigator for Carnegie
library, Robert R. Corley, assistant
dean of men, learned that entirely
too many University students are
being careless in returning bor-
rowed books.

 
 

  

 

According to Sayenga, students
have been contacted four and five
times and. still refuse to bring the
books back to the lending depart- 
ment of the library. He added

Track team seeks
to capture Southern

Cal’s IC-ILA crown

Tro ans’ decision not to come East puts

Panthers high among meet favorites

By Ben Foote

Coinpleting their third consecutive dual meet season Without
defeat, the Panther trackers seek further prestige in the annual
lCAAAA chanipionships at Cambridge, Mass, this week end.

\Vitl1 Southern California deﬁnitely remaining on the Coast,
the undefeated Pitt squad looms as the leading contender for the

crown put on the block by the Tro-
jans. The last time an Eastern
squad triumphed in this affair was
in 1937, when Pitt edged Columbia.
30 1/é-30, as Dick Mason clinched the
meet with a brilliant second place
in the 220.

Panthers highly regarded

Having knocked off the toughest
competition in the nation in trim-
ming Indiana, Penn State, Ohio
State, Michigan and Temple in suc-
cession, the Olson coached outﬁt
now rates the top of the land’s cin-
der rankings, possibly at the top in
dual meet squads.

Five seniors wearing Blue and
Gold colors for the last time, unless
they receive NCAA bids, will lead
the Panthers into the ﬁght for top
honors.

Frank Ohl, one of the outstand-
ing competitors in the sport, Al
Ferrara, Al McKee, John Bazyk,
and Bob Sulkowski compose this
quintet which has helped to write
the most brilliant chapters in Pitt
track history.

Ohl tops ﬁeld

Ohl, holder of the University rec-
ord in the 220, seeks titles in the
100 yard dash, 220 yard dash, and
broad jump. His chief opposition
will come from Barney Ewell, sen-
sational Penn State sophomore, and
Happy Stickel, winged Panther
speedster in the 100 and from Ewell
alone in the broad jump and 220.

Runner-up in the ICAAAA 220
last year and ranked on the All-
American list of sprinters last sea-
son, Ohl will provide plenty of com-
petition for the Penn State ﬂyer in
the 220. His record-shattering 20.7
clocking at Ohio State two weeks
ago betters Ewell’s best mark by
one-tenth of a second.

Making his last start in the in-
dividual quarter, Ferrara has his

» best chance in years to grab a place.

Against Warren Breidenbach and
Jack Leutritz of Michigan Ferrara
made the best showing of his var-
sity career, essaying the two fur-
longs in 48 seconds ﬂat. Even the
East’s top-notch quarter-milers, Jim
Herbert, New York U. ace and Wes
Wallace, the Fordham speedster,
have not been hitting below the 48
mark.

McKee on relay

With a University discus record
as his goal, senior Johnny Bazyk
can count heavily in the Pitt scor-
ing by taking seconds behind
Georgetown’s Al Blozis shot put in
the discus throw. McKee will run
one of the legs of the Panther mile
relay team and Sulkowski makes his
ﬁrst and last start in big—time high
jump competition.

Al Boulanger, Pitt’s outstanding
distance man, defends his two mile
title against an all star ﬁeld that in-
cludes Roy Rehr, who defeated him
in the Penn Relays, Bradley Rendell
of Alfred, and Andy Neidnig of
Manhattan.

Other juniors, who will have to
be in top form, are Dave McDowell,
high jumper, Joe Newman, hurdler,
Larry Tregoning, 220 place winner
last year, Ted Konetsky, discus
throw, Bud Graf, relay man, and
Del Anderson, half-miler.

Strickel in hurdles

Stickel heads the list of point-
making sophomores. The hand-
some sprinter battles Ewell in the
100 and then makes a try for low
hurdle honors. His 23' ﬂat univer-
sity mark tops any Eastern per-
formance, and he is favored in this
competition despite the fact that it’s
only his sixth low timber race.

Bertram sobs nostalgic farewell

Editor’s note: Four years (or
more) ago Bertram I. Jaﬁe enter-
ed the University of Pittsburgh.
Jaﬁe survived the experience, al-
though the University has yet to
recover. Today, we present the
final collegiate literary creation of
that same Jayffe, Pitt News corres-
pondent-still-a.t-large and sports
editor of the 1940 Owl.

By Bert Jaffe

Washington had his farewell ad-
dress; Lincoln had his Gettysburg
address; the Casino (plug) has its
undress, and this senior sports re-
porterintends to ﬁll up space with
a sports resume of what has hap-
pened during a four-year period of
watching.

Do you recall who made the first
touchdown when we were fresh-
men? Do you recall who the open-
ing opponents were in‘ that foot-
ball season? These two questions
and many others can be answered
by sending in a box-top of your
favorite morning breakfast food to
Mr. Robert Machesney on the eighth
floor. A -_ .-

Jonés thrills Bertie 

As we sat with our green buttons I

adorning the lapel of our coat, the
Pitt Panthers slapped Ohio Wes-
leyan all over the lot with “Biggie”
Goldberg opening the season’s scor-
ing. Many exciting incidents have
happened in Pitt’s athletic life that
September day of four years ago.
It wasn’t till this year that the
greatest thrill on the gridiron oc-
curred. In the Tech game with a
bare minute and 14 seconds left to
play, “Special Delivery” Jones let
fly a touchdown pass
Thurbon for the only score of the
game.

The greatest thrill in basketball
occurred in 1937 in one of those
tough, tight Pitt—Duke skirmishes.
The hero, Joe Garcia, sank the win-
ning ﬁeld goal with a shot from
past mid-ﬂoor as the clock showed
only seven seconds left in the ball
gains. 1 - I ‘  ’
'I"n;-ask team lauded

Another memorable football VIC-
tory happened at South Bend, In-
diana, in 1937 as the Jungle Cats
scored 21 points in the ﬁnal qua?‘
ter after trailing the Irish 6-(_).

Practically every sport In the
University curriculum Produced
some outstanding event Worthy Of
mention. The track team stole
quite a bit of space in every Paper
of the country last year When they
grabbed off four ﬁrst places in the
Penn Relays to win the team cham-
pionship hands down.

Andy Johnson notched the open-

an

to Bobby .

ing win in baseball last year as he
pitched a 3-0 shutout against the
West, Virginia Mountaineers. Pre-
vious to this, the diamond perform-
ers had dropped four straight.

Tennis comes in for its share of
the glory over our four-year span.
The match against Ohio State in
1937 was the only match that the
local racquet wielders lost during
the year.

Many legendary ﬁgures have de-
parted since the fall of 1936 when
we cut ourpﬁrst 8:30 class. “Jock”
Sutherland, the leading collegiate
football coach of the nation, is now
tutoring the professionals, and Pat
Corr, the happy Irish swimming
coach, has resigned to devote all his
time to the practice of law.

End of the trail

The twelfth of June will see the
departure of many outstanding
athletes who have made a name
for themselves and the University
during their undergraduate days.
Cassiano, Dickinson, Narick, Kris-
tufek, Kish, Fullerton,‘ and Klein
will no longer don the moleskins
as Pitt Panthers. Bob‘ Johnson,
and Jack Scherer have hung up
their basketball suits.

One of the greatest competitors
in Pitt’s track and ﬁeld history is
about to bid adieu. He is Frank
Ohl, the blonde sprinter and broad
jumper from Meadville.

And so on down the line.
bodian, Beacon, Milt and Hy Le-
derstein leave the swimming team

Pitt baseball nine must win remaining
tests to prevent hitting record low

By John Chaﬁo

Unless they chalk up victories
in all three of their remaining
games, the Pitt baseball. nine will
suﬁer an even worse season than
last when they registered only three
‘victories.

Coach Mitterling and his cohorts
must still tangle with West Vir-
ginia and Penn State, both of
whom the Pitt team met earlier
this season. All three contests will
be played on foreign soil with two
scheduled for Morgantown and one
at State College. Both teams hold
decisions over the Pitt nine in
games played on the Stadium dia-
mond.

In West Virginia the Panthers
will again face one of the outstand-
ing collegiate outﬁts in the East.

The Mountaineers boast of a bet-
ter than average ﬁelding and hit-
ting team and‘ show the outstanding
catcher in district college ranks,
Charley Hockenberry.

The Penn Staters also have a
great outﬁt this season which has
outclassed most opposition. In
pitcher Eddie Bastian, the Lions
present a hurler of potential major
league calibre. The 135-pounder
has recorded four wins this season
without a setback for the State
nine, and has proved valuable in
relief roles.

Coach Mitterling’s powerless
Panther nine is passing through
the most discouraging season in
Pitt baseball history.

Panthers were extremely weak in
the ﬁeld and on the mound. A
series of miscues, and walks by
pitcher Eddie Jones, enabled the
Duke Blue Devils to come from be-
hind and upset the Pittsters. Al-
though the Panthers gave Wake
Forest trouble, they were swamped
‘ by Maryland and Virginia.

The Panthers next had hopes of
breaking their losing ways at the
expense of Indiana State Teachers
and West Virginia. The Teachers
licked the Pitt lads, but in the
opener of the two—game series
with the Mountaineers, twirler Ben
Kish turned in the ﬁrst Panther
win.

To break the Panther plague of
errors, coach Mitterling continually
experimented with inﬁelders, es-
pecially with the ﬁrst basemen.
He used no less than four ﬁrst
sackers in a futile attempt to ﬁnd
a fair combination of hitter and

Fraternities place eight men on All-Intramural team

By Alex Zelenski

Placing eight men out of a. pos-
sible eleven on the Pitt News All-
Intramural team, the fraternities
have once again held the balance
of mushball power.

Phi Gamma Delta, occupants
of third place in the I-F league,
took top laurels with three posts on
the ﬁrst team.

Co-captains are Mel Port and Lou
Mendlow, both unanimous choices.

Red Port showed an undefeated
record. His outstanding eﬁort was
his no-hit game early in the year,
and he also clouted plenty of base
hits in the cleanup post.

Lou Mendlow, Sigma Alpha Mu’s
kingbee, also played the hero’s role
for his club.

Control and blistering speed gave
Mendlow a no-hitgame and several
one-hitters.-» His prowesswith the
bat also matched Port’s.

Bert Jaffe, Pi Lam ace, is the
other mound choice. Jaffe’s one-
man efforts drove his team into
second place in the fraternity race.

Milton Ripp, Gamma Gamma Woo
stalwart, wins the ﬁrst base nod
over Dave Saunders of the Oil &
Gas team“‘because of his long dis-
tance hitting. Ripp has more home
runs than any player in the intra-
mural ranks, and has been a bear
on defense.

voting.

By Vince Matera

Although last year’-s biggest siege
guns, Bill Daddio and Tony Kay,
were gone from the the squad, the
Panther golf team marked up a
record on a par with the tally sheet
of the ’39 outﬁt.

Under coach Art Underwood,
they salvagedlfour victories out of
10 matches as against ﬁve wins out
of 11 matches for last year’s team.
Both squads won only one out of
ﬁve Eastern Intercollegiate Golf
association matches.

The Penn State Lions handed Pitt
its ﬁrst defeat as Jim Kennedy was
the only victorious Panther. ,

The Oaklanders came back fast
as they
Tech, 9-0. Bob Seybold showed
up best in‘ downing Shynowsky, 9
and 7. U 

Cornell handed them a loss, 7-2,

although Bill Reilly starred with a
medal round of 77 which won his
match and the best ball for two
points.

Pitt got sweet revenge the next
day at Ithaca as they downed Penn
State in a surprise win, 5-4.

A breathing spell from league
play came when the Panthers beat
Grove City by a lop-sided 14-4
score. The point-for-each-nine,
point-for-the eighteen rules were
in force.

In a match the Panthers were
favored to win, Penn staged a
whirlwind ﬁnish to emerge vic-
tors, 5-4.

Georgetown walloped Pitt, 8-1,
and Princeton gobbled up all nine

points in their match with the
Panthers.
With McClintock and Reilly

missing, the Panthers lost to Navy
at Annapolis, 7-2. Kramer and
Kennedy were the only Pitt point-
makers.

Pitt broke the long losing streak

between Chris Watson, Phi Gam,
Ivan Bielek,,Oil & Gas; and Chuck
Wuertenberger, Kappa Sigma. Wat-

At the hot corner were several
standouts, including: Chuck Page, Pi

Sigma Chi; Ray Dimit, Phi Gamma
Delta; Tom Halloran, Phi Kappa;
Hershey Mattes, Pi Lambda Phi;
Sam Milanovich, Newman Club;
and Babe Stark, Gamma Gamma

Tom Halloran earned the ﬁrst
team position as his ﬁelding was
the only bright feature of the Phi
Kappas’ mediocre season.

Grossett for catcher

The shortstop position found one
boy who easily overshadowed the
ﬁeld. Charley Ptacek is the lad who
is hitting»and~l-ﬁelding. at short in
ﬁne style for the independent cham-
pion Newman Club. Johnny Eitel,
Phi Gam, was placed on the second
team because of his hitting power.

Th e unsung hero’s position,
catcher, goes to Ken Grossett, Phi
Gam. Grossett, the Phi Gams’ pack
of dynamite, was one of the hardest
hitters“ in the fraternity league.~ On
the second team was Sigma Chi’s
catcher, Ted Starzynski.

The ﬁrst team outﬁeld was com-
posed of three fraternity men, Gus
Wilde, Pi Kappa Alpha; Bill Ed-

Racquetmen close schedule with ﬁve straight
victories‘ to push won-lost average above .500

By Hiram Milton
After a dismal start, Pitt’s tennis team picked up steam near the
season’s close to wind up the 1940 net campaign with a record of seven

wins against ﬁve losses.

By sweeping their last ﬁve matches the Panthers

were saved from putting one of the worst seasons in Pitt history on the

record books.

A 9-0 defeat at the hands of Ohio State’s powerful Buckeyes at C0-

lumbus opened the Blue and Gold
season. Two more whitewashings
were tagged on the Cathedral court-
men before they were able to break
into the win column. Penn State
and the University of Miami’s pow-
erful netmen blanked Pitt, 9-0.
Coached by former intercollegiate
champ Gardner Mulloy and using
nationally-ranked j’uI1i01‘ luminary

Billy Gillespie, the Orangemen were

easily one of thestrongest outﬁts to
face the Panthers.

Slippery Rock’s weak team fell
prey to the victory-hungry Jungle
Cats, 9-0. In a match that was fea-
tured by several close battles, Pitt
successfully invaded Groye City
5-4.

barely nosed out Pitt, 5-4,: after the

to the East brought an even split in
two matches for Pitt. Navy, led by
Davis Cup star Joe Hunt, beat the
Pittsburghers, 9-0, but George
Washington university was unable
to match Pitt’s well-balanced lineup
and lost, 6-3, to the invading forces.’

After taking the city net cham- ‘

When Martin, Weiss, and Kristu-

Martin, a determined, plugging

University will play host

to American

Program to feature
industrial plant visit
By Julia Vvaida.

All roads will lead to Pittsburgh
this summer for physicists of the
United States.

The American Physical society
will convene at its national meet-
ing at the University from June 20
through June 22. The applica-
tions of physics in industry will be
the theme of the entire meeting.
Visits to Pittsburgh’s foremost in-
dustrial plants and research labor-
atories are also being included in
the program. The last day’s ses-
sions will be devoted to a symposi-
um on the most recent develop-
ments in applied physics.

The University’s third special
summer session on the physics of
metals, scheduled for, June 17 to
July 27, will also attract distin-
guished visitors, announces Dr. El-
mer I-lutchisson, professor and head
of the department.

Dr. Lee A. DuBridge, professor
of physics and dean of the faculty
of arts and science at the Univer-
sity of Rochester, will give a six-
weeks’ introductory course on the
clectron theory of metals. The
course will consist of two evening
lectures a week to enable. the full
participation of industrial physic-
ist.s and engineers whose positions
prevent them from attending the
day sessions.

Dr. DuBridge, who is known as
the builder of the cyclotron at the
University of Rochester and the in-
itiator of signiﬁcant biological stu-
dies in nuclear physics at Roches-
ter. will also give a six-weeks’ ser-
ies ot lectures on nuclear physics
and the application of artiﬁcial ra-
dioactive materials in medical and
other fields.

Dr. Ralph P. Johnson, physicist
at the General Electric company,
will give a short lecture course on
the experimental determination of
the properties of metals. Aseries

reorganization

Pitt Business Institute, official
organization of Business Adminis-
tration students, will undergo a
complete reorganization and change
next year.

A larger membership drive has
been planned for next year and a
schedule of social functions “that
will be really carried out” is being
worked out, according to Len Wolk,
BA43, executive committee mem-
ber.

The new name, something “new,
snappy, and catchy, still denoting
a Business Administration organi-
zation,” ,Wo1k asserted; has not yet
been decided.

During the last semester, ﬁve
luncheons, two weeks apart, have
been planned. Also included in
ﬁrst semester activities are two
“buzzers”' (stag smokers) and a
“possibility of a dance.”

Second semester plans consist of
six luncheons, a “buzzer” and a
“finale” picnic.

The increase in activity is in-
tended to bring PBI among the
most active organizations of its kind
in the University.

“All we need is the cooperation.
of the Business Administration stu-
dents,” says Wolk.

physicists

DR. ELMER HUTCHISSON
physicists to convene

erties of metals will be presented
by W. V. Houston, professor of
physics at the California Institute
of Technology.

Although the topics are strictly
in the ﬁeld of metals, Dr. Hutchis-
son explained, no sharp transition
between metals and non-metals can
be established, and that in many
respects. glass behaves like a metal.
