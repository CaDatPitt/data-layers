Scheduled   for Today

Two parades, an Interfraternity sweepstakes race
this afternoon and an informal sports dance tonight
will complete the Spring Festival’s two-day sched-
ule of events.

At 1:30 o’clock ROTC graduation ceremonies will
take place on the Cathedral lawn. Cadets will parade
and then while the regiment is on line facing Heinz
chapel, all senior cadets will form in one long line
facing Colonel Edward Kelly, professor of military
science and tactics, who will address them.

The one line signiﬁes the abolishment of all cadet
rank since all senior cadets will be commissioned on
commencement night as secondlieutenants in the
US army.

Immediately after the ROTC ceremonies, the
Spring Festival parade will begin including the
ROTC. corps, the ROTC band, and the women’s
ﬂoat parade. This year the ﬂoat parade will use as
its theme Mother Goose rimes.

Mary Rita Keenan, C43, chairman of the ﬂoat
parade committee said that the route of the ﬂoats
would ‘start on Tennyson, down Bayard, Bigelow and
O’Hara to Thackeray, down Thackeray along Fifth
to University place and back up along O’Hara, Bige-
low and Bayard. Probably the judges stand will be
set up near the Tri-Delt houseon Bayard street.

The victor’s cup will be given to the winning wom-
en’s fraternity during the evening dance.

At 3:30 o’clock the interfraternity sweepstakes
race will be run along the Bayard-Bigelow route.
A cup will also‘ be awarded to the winners of this
race at the dance.

Closing the Spring festival’s two-day run will be
the Sport Swing to be held tonight in- the Hotel
Sc-henley beginning at 9 o'clock.

Senior Queen nominee‘ Elinor Ban-brow is best
known around campus for her WSGA activities. Sel-
dom seen off the twelfth ﬂoor, attractive, slim Elinor
was a member of senior court, was tapped last year
to Mortar Board; gives much of her time to the
AEPhi’s.

Best by test was Bernadette Blatt, whose class-
mateselected her senior queen, the ﬁrst of these
regents who was not announced at Tap Day exer-

cise. Bernie, quiet, ladylike, also made Mortar Board, 4

Pi Tau Phi, WSGA and Senior Court.

The Tri-Delts produced an outstanding senior wom-
an in the attractive form of WSGA prexy Jean Brink.
Selected senior worthy last year, Jean is also a Mor-
tar Board active, probably has headed more commit
tees than any other ’42er. '

Carrying out this year’s Hall of Fame practice of
selecting pretty as well as capable women, the group

‘picked’ blonde Helen Buente, outgoing Panhellenic

Council president. Rosy-checked Helen adds much
to ZTA meetings, a well as those of Mortar Board
and WSGA.

Nancy Crawford ran a. close second to Bernie Blatt
in the Senior Queen race, was consequently made
Alma Mater; in this capacity she, as have past Alma

Maters, will do the most work, get little glory. Nancy I ‘H '
donned a coed captain’s uniform this fall, is presi- '

dent of Mortar Board and a member of WSGA, three

' good reasons why her sister Theta’s.are proud of her. ~,

}larris’s extra-curricular activities is membership in
Mortar Board and SF'A. Recently- engagedvto Cadet-
colonel Jimmy Dimel, she walked beside him as coed
colonel at the fall ceremonies.

Athletic is the word for Harriet Harris, who is
most often seen in sports garb, but looks good in any
kind of clothes. Mortar Board member Harris was
one of last year’s junior worthies, is a coed Lt.-Col-
onel, was tapped to Xylon for her work on the Pitt
News.

Presiding over Senior Court this year was'pleas-
ant-voiced Elizabeth Foster. Libby leaves behind her
a long list of accomplishments in Mortar Board and
WSGA. One of the most gracious of this year’s out-
standing women, shealso has a voice at Kappa meet-
mgs.

Delta Zeta active Virginia Porter directed as chair- ’

man a well-paced Scholar’s Day program, is also
known -for her work in Mortar Board. Cheerful, schol-
arly Ginny has a smile for everyone, was president

Zia aame  . 

A good choice to lead the old newsboys’ drive was
energetic, witty Betty Sapp, who has been on as
many dance committees as any of her classmates.
Recently married to an armyman, Betty lends spirit
to "Theta meetings, as well as to SFA conclaves. She
was activein Mortar Board, made herself popular
among fellow WSGA members. A

Silver haired Jack (John J.) Brady, with a string
of solid achievements to his credit during his four
years at the University, leads the list. One time cam-

pus editor of the Pitt News, Independent SFA mem- '
ber, Cap and Gowner, Brady is a membefof ODK.

If the Owl is out Monday. it’s because John Brosky,
editor of the year book and captain of the varsity
cross country team, could move fast. When the Uni-
versity accelerated, Brosky accelerated. He is ODK
and a member 9f Delta Tau Delta.

When funny‘ fellow, D. J. Bailey goes into the Army
he will have this to remember: his job as business
manager of the Military Ball, Cap and Gown, SFA,
and Pi Kappa Alpha. ~

As president of Independent Association, and as
an active Independent party man, Politician Hiramc
Milton will be remembered long by fraternity men.
Milton was in Pitt Players, and’ also ODK. Top Poli
Sci man‘, heiis, president of Pi Sigma Alpha, honorary

i:William Seyler, president of the legal eagles in

;,John Marshall and chairman of Pitt Town Meeting,

as well as a member of. Men’s Debating association,
must have done a lot of talking this year. Seyler was

. also ‘chairman of the special SFA re-elections; com-

.mittee for the election last Wednesday and is a
member of the YMCA. -

Smooth Jack Staulf, president of Delta Tau Delta,
a senior worthy, and former editor of the Panther,
last year and this fall, is also a prominent member of

. SFA inner circles.

In preparation for a soldier's life James Dimel is a
colonel'1n the ROTC and captain of Scabbard and
Blade. He is one of the few men in the Army who
are colonels and captains at the same time. Besides

. these Dimel is vice-president of ODK and a member

of Pi Kappa Alpha.

Engineer Richard Mansﬁeld, is president of Inter-
fraternity Council and 9. member of Phi Gamma

editor. He succeeds

edictis, will have to

achievements.

New business man-
ager Ed Tablac re-
places Julian R. Sil-
verman. His job is to
see that the News
pays, maintains, and
balances a good bud-
get.

Chief publication covering news of the University of
Pittsburgh, appearing tri-weekly, containing newsworthy
news, pictures, and prevalent, more-or-less serious stu-
dent opinions is the Pitt News. .

This year the News became an eight-page tabloid with
a streamlined format, more modern type, and the greatest

. coverage of campus news in the history
of the University.

Credit for setting this new high in
Pitt News accomplishments must go
to aggressive, retiring-editor Jack de
Benedictis. Assuming the duties of
both editor and managing editor, de
Benedictis, wrote editorials, news sto-
ries, did make-up, worked at the print-
ers, delivered the ‘papers on campus,
formulated and maintained a liberal

_ editorial policy.

Saying goodbye to the News is sharp, pretty Georgia
Shuset, who has administered for three years a much
needed feminine touch.

Most journalistic of the News’ women associates, Miss
Shuset wrote straight news, features, editorials, the witty,
New Yorkerish column “Little Red Schoolhouse.” She
worked at the make—up desk, blackened
pretty ﬁngers at the printers.

Third senior leaving the News is
quiet, studious Julia Waida, copy editor,
late-stayer, grammatical expert. Miss
Waida upon graduation assumes new
duties with the University of Pittsburgh
Press, will be faculty adviser to Xylon.
Story and picture of Miss Waida appear
on page four. a

Assuming the editorship and conse-
quent worries of next year’s News is
lean, sharp-witted Irwin Rosen. His rise was swift in
three years-—reporter, make-up editor, editor.

Fresh from making up the Pitt News, Rosen calls last
year’s make-up editor, E. S. Kerber, “the master,” is a
walking, talking source of type-face information, also
writes pungent editorials.

Rosen is a psychology major, ex-trumpet player in the
Pitt Band, and, next to publishing a good Pitt News,
would like to do something on the order of Ziggy Elman.

Job that awaits Rosen this summer is gathering more
news than the Pitt News will be able to handle. Intending
to publish once or twice weekly, the News will have to
print only essential news, yet have complete coverage.

Also smaller in size will be the summer staﬁ’, composed
of former campus editors, Fred Lange, Bill Ollis, and
Paul Lohmeyer; former associate editor Charles Camar-
ata, sports editor Alex Zelenski, and twenty reporters.

~ New business manager is Druid, ODK man Ed Tablac.
‘Versed in the ﬁnancial intricacies of the Pitt News, Tablac
was its former advertising manager. He is in the School
of Business Administration and like his News colleague.
Rosen, was a varsity debater. Affairs of business shelved
temporarily, Tablac listens to swing music, thinks of bet-
ter ways to get more ads. continues as a. member of the
Newman club. 1

Co-editors "August
Trovaioli and Bob Col-
ton will work hand in
hand to turn out next
year’s Owl which will
cover three semesters.
“Gus” will handle the
art work, Bob will
take care of the liter-
ary side.

To new Owl busi-

ness manager Bob
Sullivan falls the job
of computing and

maintaining a well-
ﬁnanced yearbook. He
replaces Tom Wester-
man.

Least raucous, most sedate of stu-
dent publications is the Owl. Published
in the spring of every year the Owl is
a record of one year at the University
of Pittsburgh, is read and preserved
by nostalgic seniors, returning under-
graduates, old alumni.

The process of publishing the Owl is
slow, costly, painstaking. Work begins
when the school year begins,.ends when
the senior class graduates. Pictures
must be taken of seniors, organizations,
all year round. Histories must be writ-

 

/1.

activities, dances,
ten, traditions explained, cut-lines cut and polished, all
year round.

Next year, for the ﬁrst time in its history, the Owl will
be co-edited by August Trovaioli and
Bob Colton. Dark-haired, joking Tro-
vaioli will do and oversee art work
such as pictures, photographs, etch- /?
ings, color, general layout.
Trovaioli is an ex-Uniontowner, ex- \ Q 6’ I
Penn Stater, painter, ﬁne arts major. He ” l ’
tells many and old jokes, paints im- "V!
pressionistically, surealistically, accord- W
ing to his whim. Mumbling Italian,
singing like a prima donna, he comes
in, goes out of the Owl and Pitt News
oﬁices frequently.

The seventh ﬂoor is his studio, the eighth ﬂoor is mecca
for fast talk, spasmodic work. When he studies no one
has yet discovered. -

“Gus,” as he is called, has original plans for next year’s
Owl, would like to see this year’s make an all-American
rating. ,

His colleague, unassuming, cons-
cientious Bob Colton, will give the
next Owl the necessary literary ﬂair,
proper writing style, general all
around readability.

Wavyhaired Colton has worked on
the Owl‘ for less than one year, be-
longs to Phi Epsilon Pi fraternity,
participates in few activities. Frater-
nity brothers play havoc with his good
nature, ask him to write themes. Like
his co-editor, Colton hopes also to see an all-American Owl.

Acceleration will touch next year’s Owl too, since Uni-
versity curriculum will be divided into three semesters—-
spring, summer, fall. Owl for 1943 will, therefore, appear
next spring, will cover all three semesters. It will be mail-
ed to seniors graduated in the meantime.

Business manager will be conﬁdent Bob Sullivan who
sells many ads, back-ﬂaps business associates, is :1 vol-
uble talker. He is a Druid man and a member of Men's
Debating team. -

To him fall the \‘f..l‘il€‘S of high ﬁnance, close to being
highest of all three student publications.

Its main business being humor, Pitt Panther magazine

this year smartened up its appearance and content by tak- .

ing on a Life-magazine comp1exion——sna,ppier literary
style, bigger and better pictures, unheard of sales increase.

Editor of this elegant publication was behind-the-scenes.
Jack Stauﬂ’, who felt a natural glow of pleasure when hit
magazine was cal-led “best in the coun-
try” in its class.

Pitt Panther has covered thorough-
ly most campus activities, become
more representative of Pitt collegiate
life. In all its history the magazine
has this year best presented a cross-
section picture of Tuck shop life, dance
life, student-faculty life.

‘Source of much delight to both the
Pitt Panther and the Pitt News, is their
traditional needling of each other in al-
most every issue. Which suffers most‘ is best judged by
the humor magazine. It must sell itself. _

Most recent raking over the coals was delivered to the
Pitt News when the Panther, under the guise of a eulo-
gistic sketch of life in the Pitt News oﬂice, caused Pitt
News men and women to blush for three days after. Swift

retaliation by the News was weak, dis-
appointed Panther men and women. dis-
appointed interested observers, left Pitt
Panther one up on the News.

Retiring earlier in the year Stauf
made way for acting editor Dave
Naley who has maintained Panther’

Incoming editor is pipe-smoking,

Q"
noiseless James Glasgow. He writes,

has written, good stories for the Pitt
Panther for three years, even gets A’s in English. Like

Stauff and N aley, Glasgow is a DTD fraternity man, pre-
serves thereby a long tradition, divides his time between
writing stories and doing pledge duty.

To see that the University's humor magazine main-
tains an even ﬁnancial keel, hardworking Charles Page
replaces senior awardee Ed Tait. Like Tait, smiling-eyed
Page belongs to PiKA fraternity, also plays basketball,
is a Druid.

Comptroller for 1942 Panther, Page will next year guide 

the ad-getting policy, assume all ﬁnancial troubles, try to
make college humor pay.

Likelihood is that the Pitt Panther will be published for
all three of the University’s semesters. However, it may
only appear on campus in the fall and spring.

BIoocIDonors

Are Needed

Volunteer blood donors are ur-
gently needed to ﬁll the quota of
250 set by the Red Cross mobile

' blood bank unit which is scheduled

to come to Pitt Monday, Tuesday
and Wednesday.

Volunteers should obtain appli-
cation blank at the offices of the
Men’s or VVomen’s Student Health
services as soon as possible.

“Here is an opportunity for Pitt
men and women to really do some-
thing for their country,” said Dr.
H. C. Carlson, director of the Men’s
Student Health service, today.

“VVe must remember the Red
Cross slogan, ‘An hour of your life.
may save the life of some soldier,
sailor, or marine ﬁghting for your
country/”

Dr. Carlson pointed out that
students may be saving the lives of
their friends in the army or navy_
by giving blood. It is even con-
ceivable, he stated, that a‘ man now
in school, should within the next
few months, when he is in the
armed‘ forces, be saved from death
"by a blood transfusion.

Pitt is the ﬁrst Pittsburgh or-
ganization, to be honored by the
coming of a mobile blood unit. The
unit, consisting of one doctor, four
nurses,-vtwo orderlies, and several
staﬁ assistants, will operate Mon-
day, Tuesday, and Wednesday from
12:15 to 5:15 o’clock in 244 Cathe-
dral.

Editor John Brosky announced
today that the 1942* Owl will be on
campus for distribution Monday
morning in room 812 C.L.

_All seniors and undergraduates
may get their Owl upon payment
of the balance of deposit any day
next week. Seniors may also re-

ceive their Owl immediately fol-»

lowing Commencement exercises,
Sunday or Monday, when they re-
turn their Caps and Gowns. Final
distribution will take place on

Last Wednesday’s election, one

Panther Gridders To Meet in Second

lntra-Squad Game; West May Not Play

G-rid coach Charlie Bowser sends
his charge through another intra-
squad game tomorrow afternoon at
the football practiccﬁeld next to
the track house. The second in tilt‘.
spring’ series of practice contests.
tomorrow’s game will be more of
a regular tilt than was last Satur-
d-ay’s intra-squad workout.

Last weekend the players were
put through a somewhat hit and
miss game. Throughout the game
Bowser and his aides stopped play
to correct faults and to make

‘ changes in the lineups. No kickoff
was used, the ball merely being
-placed in play by one of the coach-
I‘.

Although up to now the team
has been shaping up fairly well,
Bowser still has two big problems

Which must be solved before he can _

ﬁeld a team next fall with any sem-
blance of conﬁdence. The first of
these headaches is the ﬁnding of a
suitable, understudy for quarter-
back Walter West. Last year’s ﬁrst
string signal caller is the only
ﬁeld general on this season's squad.

Attempts have been made to
convert one of the numerous half-
back: on the squad to a quarter-
back, but thus far the experiment

' hasn’t worked out. There is ‘a pos-
sibility that West may be drafted
before the coming season opens.
Should this happen, a hole in the
Panther backﬁeld would be creat-
ed that would be hard to ﬁll, to put
it mildly.

The other big problem which
must be faced is at the end posts.

All of last year’s first and second

string ends have either graduated

or taken defense jobs which pre-
vent their playing this season.

However, the practice season up
to now hasn’t been without its
bright spots. In last week’s game
the playing of fullback Mat Gebel
was something to watch as time af-
ter time he ripped through the line
for sizeable gains. The all around
play of Bill Futerich and Bruce
Allen has also stood out and a lot
more will probably be heard from
these three players.

31 Opener

_ Pitt’s 1942 baseball team will make its debut tomorrow at
the Stadium against a reputedly strong Bucknell squad. The
Pitt team, with exactly two men having previous experience
will largely be one that is untried, untested, and as such, high-

ly unpredictable.

Carmell?) Ranii, tall left hander from Blawnox, is slated to
pitch the opener, scheduled to begin at 1:45 o’clock, with Bill

Nabors doing the receiving. How-
ever, Ranii has been plagued with
a sore arm and a last minute switch
may see Bill McKee, a sophomore
and another southpaw take the
mound.

The inﬁeld while primarily of
the “good ﬁeld, no hit” variety has
been imminently satisfactory and
is set with Johnny Brown at ﬁrst
base, Ed Fisher, at second, Bill
Kostenbauder taking over at short-
stop, and Fred Wilner on third.

The outﬁeld patrol will consist of
John Vaiksnor, the converted short-
stop, in right ﬁeld, George Jacobs

Admission to the game between
Pitt and Bucknell beginning at
1:45 o'clock tomorrow may be se-
cured by presenting student activ-

price of admission is 25¢.

Phi Kappa, last season’s intramural champs, have copp -.
top honors in Division A with a record of ﬁve wins against

of an underdog Phi Delt aggrega-
tion.

According to early season dope,
the Phi Kap crew was rated odds
on favorites to win the cherished
crown for the second time in as
many years. Led by the all-intra-
mural battery of Mike Sotak and
Frank Dax, the Phi Kaps have
lived up to all expectations in tak-
ing ﬁrst place without too much
diﬂiculty.

The most surprising squad in the

Greek diamond race has been Phi.

Delta Theta. The Phi Delt nine had
been regarded earlier in the sea-
son as, one of the weaker squads
and was not to be considered as a.
contender in the inter-fraternity
title scramble. However, the Dith-
ridge St. lads‘ managed to ﬁeld one
of the most well balanced nines in
either circuit and climaxed their
drive for mushball honors by up-
setting the highly touted Phi Kaps.

With their schedule already com-
pleted,. the Phi Delts are in a sec-
ond place deadlock and will battle
Sigma Chi next Monday to deter-

thusiastic elections ever held.

Cashing in on student opinion
aroused to an unprecedented pitch,
which brought out a record-smash-
ing 1,945 votes, the Independents
pushed through their amendment
with a majority of over 250 votes,
the totals being 1,093 for, 852
against.

Although losing CA completely
to the Fraternity candidates, the
Independents took seven out of 10
available Men’s Council spots.

Again it was Aldo Icardi, named
today, as outstanding junior man,
who topped his own high vote mark
with the astounding total of 670
X’s beside his name—a total which
more than doubled the vote o'f his
closest opponent. Fraternity can-
didate, junior—worthy Gus Wilde

» garnered 317 votes.

iClimaxinig one of the bitterest
struggles in years, today's re-e_lec-
tion equalized membership in SFA
at 16 seats for each party.

The passage of the amendment
may well mean the end of the
straight party-line system of vot-
ing that has characterized many
of the decisions emanating from
SFA meetings. For, with a dead-
locked party representation—if
SFAers decide to vote on party
lines alone, ignoring the merits of
the issues at hand—all important

Never before have students as a whole shown such inter-
est in student government.

Never beforehave fraternity men been willing to come

out in the open and ask for general student support-—as A

they did in their “Student News.”

Never before have Independents w,on such a victory as ,

they won last Wednesday. And never before have they had
the opportunity to do as much good in student government as
they have now.

Congratulations are in order, we believe.

.And our first congratulations go to Bill Seyler, who ran
the re-election‘, and to the student-faculty, administration
advisory committee, whose recommendations were mainly
responsible for the success of the re-election.

Next in line for congratulations are the Independent par-
ty workers and leaders, whose plans and program have so
evidently appealed to most students.

Congratulations should go to those Fraternity leaders
who have behaved well under the circumstances, and who have
cheerfully taken the ﬁrst beating they have ever been given.

And last but not least, congratulations should go to Dean
of Men Biddle for his admirable and impartial ‘advice and en-
couragement to both parties. .

Much should be expected from the New SFA. SFA has
a greater responsibility to the student body since more of
the student body felt that they were responsible for SFA.

SFA has had some new blood injected into its present
anemic body. The students will want to see whether this new
blood has a favorable effect on the health of this body--‘—on
the health of student government,
