Last Friday’s unofficial, impromptu pep rally was a
great success according to the organizers, Jack de Bene- _
dictis, C42, editor of the Pitt News, Irwin Rosen, C43, as-’

sistant to the editor of the News, and Alex Zelenski, C43,

sports editor of the News.

“We’re sure that we showed that Pitt students do have
real school spirit, and that they are behind the team all A

the way,” said Zelenski, after the rally. -
V The rally was first revealed when last Friday’s Pitt New

appeared on campus about

The rally got under way about 12 :45 and the ﬁrst speaker‘ .
on the program was a student, Roy Ruane, C42, president.
of SFA,'who gave the rally the blessings of the assembly. a
Dean Leonard O’Connell, of the School of Pharm- ;

team a good pepping up, and predicted that Pitt would

Bowser was followed by team captain Ralph Fife, E42, ‘ I

BA43, chairman of the SFA Assembly committee, was in- V 

formed. r

“We wanted to keep it as secret and as spontaneous as‘
possible,” explained Rosen. “And I think we proved that

  etters to the Editor  ..

I do not attempt here to either
justify or attempt to conceal
fundamental issues behind a
smoke screen of legal technical-
ities. The attempt to brand the
Nazrs as pirates simply because
they resist our participation in
the war, is just such a smoke-
screen, and is no credit either to
the Roosevelt administration or
to the American people.

If the ’goyernn1ent of the United
States is determined to see Nazi-
ism defeated, that is its sovereign
right as an independent nation.
If the American people desire an
Allied victory they have a right
to insist on policies which will at-
end. But why cry
“Foul!” when we are hit back?
By this time we ought to recognize
that in war a nation is more con-
cerned with its own preservation,
than in adherence. to the niceties
of international law.

Death or Recession

_ We are frequently told that
“You Can’t Do Business With Hit-
ler.” Surely no one is so foolish as
to doubt the truth of that state-
ment. But is this the essential
point? If we do not enter the
war and insure an immediate vic-
tory for Britain, we shall surely
suffer economically. We must
choose between passing through a.
prolonged period of industrial re-
cession and sending three milion
Americans to their death on for-
eign soil. ‘ ‘

To fight for business interests
is greed and materialism at its
worse. We must decide which is
more to be valued,‘ a nation's
men or its material.

Interventionists also cite fre-
quently that we must enter the
war to insure a “just peace.” This
is a myth. There is no just peace
so long as there are victors and
despoiled. Lloyd George won the
Parliamentary elections in 1917 on

ing costs in general, they ‘might;
take a glance at the parallel situ-
ation in China. .3 \

Students there, able to live on
$5 a month before the war, have
been barely getting on, under-
nourished, on $50 per ~ month.
Next school year, they may have
to pay nearer $100. .

Even with the government help,
many students have been living on
the poorest diets; and in many
cases are suffering from malnutri-
tion. The situation is ‘aggravated
by the overcrowding resulting both
from increased enrollment and
from temporary quarters. The rate
of tuberculosis  extremely high.

The position of teachers is even

more. critical; _
LA recent survey in Chengtu in-I
dicates that few if any university

professors are living within their V

salaries, but that most are either

consuming savings or borrowing to "

get through. One effect is already
being felt’ through the increasing‘
difficulty of holding or securing
teachers, since ymost of them are
turning‘ to more ‘ proﬁtable pro-
fe-ssions;

The difficulty of importing
equipment and supplies and of
transporting them through the
iBuu-ma bottleneck has seriously
affected almost all courses. Text-
books are inadequate; chemical
 scientiﬁc apparatus are woe-
fully short; and libraries are liv-
ing on"”’§ mere trickle of new
boolcs. '

English Dept

Iy LOIS KOWIOTTOM _

In a weak attempt to analyze
the character of D1-. Percival
Hunt, professdor of English, ‘the
“Bulletin Index” came out this
week with the statement that Dr.
Hunt is “nasty toward inferior
Worli. ”

Students in Dr. Hunt’; classes
know this to be untrue, or at
least a bad choice of words. Dr.
Hunt more often encourages stu-
dents than “‘lseats them down."
Seldom does a pupil get back a
theme without at least one favor-
able comment on it. Never does
he actually treat -the pupil inz a
“nasty” manner.

The description appeared in an

A “article describing the University’s

u

     
  

English department. Much credit
was given to Dr. Hunt for intro-
ducing a new ‘/“era in English.”
After an adequate account of
Dr. Hunt’: life since he gradu-
ated from the University of
Iowa until he joined the Pitt
faculty twenty y¢l.l’$ ago,‘ the
article outlines his method of
teaching and his influence on the
curriculum at Pitt. '

Teachers who were once Hunt’s
stmlents -are named, particular
rccog-nition being given to profes-
sors Myers, Mayer, and Peterson.

Also nentioed are former
Pitt English teachers who now
hold high positions in other col-
leges. And a list of Pitt students
who /are prominent in letters is
given. "

All of which leads to a. discus;
sion of the department of English
as it operates to-day. The depart-
mental committee is named and
explained. This committee, the
article ‘says, has taken over much
of the tedious routine of depart-
mental business.

Dr. Hunt has reached a place
“envied by all those who gladly
teach", it closes. And English
students at Pitt know how true
that is.

Reversing the modern trend ‘of
changing from a peace to a war-.
time economy, Prof. A. SW. Clyde
of Pennsylvania State college has
used an instrument of war to aid
the. former in the peaceful" task
of plowing.

Adopting the principles used in
the recoil mechanism of artillery,
Professor Clyde has developed a
satisfactory automatic release
hitch for use on tractors when
plowing in rocky ground. —

After the plow hits a solid
rock, the tractor is stopped in 8
to 10 inches and is gently pulled
back and recoupled to the plow.
All the plowman must do is to back
away or otherwise release his im-

plement from thexstone and go on
with his work.

The Dartmouth studenbof today
has an easy time preparing himself
sartorially for the great" event of
commencement compared to
seniors in the early days of the
college. Judah Dana, Darthmouth
1795, recorded that his commen-
cement dress consisted of a. “black
coat, waist coat and small clothes,
large silver shoe buckles, black
silk gloves and a black cocked hat,
with my hair cued down with 8.
black ribbon and my head and
hair powdered as white as the
driven snow.” Woo-woo!

Outlines Art Gallery ‘l7V1'II Show
Museum of Modern Art Movies

By ANGELO QKUNO

Most of us think of movies only
as entertainment. The Museum of
l‘.‘l.ode1*n Art has, since 1935, how-
ever, collected movies as an art ex-
}"H“eSSl0!1..0f the people. Their col-
lection includes nmny experiment-
al movies fromall over the world,
and dates back to “The Great
;l‘1'ain Robbery.”

Up until a few years ago they
could only be seen in New York
at the Museum. Now, however,
Pittsburgh will have 'a chance to
see soe of the finest movies
thagt have ever been made.
Through Elizabeth Rockwell of
Outlines, contemporary art gal-
lery, 34‘! Boulevard of the Allies,
ﬁfteen of these movies will be
shown in Pittsburgh beginning in
November. = -

Miss Rockwell has selected‘ the
films wisely. Seen‘ consecutively,
they will give Pittsburghers a. sur-
vey of movies as an art expres-
sion. Among the movies to be
/shown are;

“The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari."
This famous German film made in
1919' is an example of expres-
sion in the movies. It deals with
the “uI|known" and all the sinis-
ter forces of life. lt is a great

/

creation, and makes “Franken-
stein" and "Jekyll and Hyde”
seem pale in comparison.

“The, Doctor’s Secret” was pro-
duced in 1900 in France by George
Melics. Melies is one of the mas-
ters of trick photography and ﬁlm
invention.

“The Last Laugh” is a German
movie produced in 1925 with
Emil Jannings in the starring
role. It has had more technical
inﬂuence than any ‘other movie
ever made.

“The Love of Jeanne Ney” is
one of the earliest crime movies,
made in Germany in 1927. It con-
ceals its social theme in a. net-
work of jewel theft and murder.

“The Smiling Madame Beudet”
(French, 1924) was directed by
one of the greatest women di-

' rectors of all time, Germaine du
Lac. This movie is a psychologi-
cal drama of extraordinary skill
and subtelty.

‘The Story of Gosta Berling”
was the first important Garbo
movie. Produced in Sweden in
1923, it is a. richly poetic adapta-
tion of Selma L§a.g‘erlof’s great
novel. ,

“Greed” (American, 1923) is
one of Eric von Sh-oheim's great

movies. An impassioned and ‘in-
tense story, it will always be re-
membered by those who saw it.

“The Plow That Broke The
Plain,” “The River,” and “The
City” are Pare Lorentz movies,
produced by the U. S. Government.
They have great poetic power and
sociological signiﬁcance.

Other movies to be shown in-
clude “M o a n a,” “Poten.-nkin,"
"Chess Fever,” and “The Youth
of Maxim.” Prices for the series
have not yet been set, but Miss
Rockwell promises student rates.

At the Stanley . . .

On the Stanley stage, Ralph Ed-

‘warr.l;s and his crew bring to this

town the zaniest of the current
quiz shows, “Truth or Conse-
quences.” The Edwa1*ds‘show

ley third to such stal_wart;< as
“Information Please” and “Double
or Nothing.”

is

It is probably the only quiz
program which places a premium
on not answering the questions
correctly. Some of the perform-
ances seem prearranged. The

only answer is that, such beingxhave been!

the case, the entire arrangement
is so much louder and funnier.
Certainly no other quiz show
could appeal so much to a visual
audience.

Plump and pleasant Dolly Dawn
may be excused for having left
bandleader George Hall to form
her own Dawn Patrol. Pitt stu-
dents will remember her for her
appearance on campus two years
ago to lead a‘ football rally.

Those who saw Bill Powell in
“The Maltese Falcon" some eight
years ago will be interested in
seeing Humphrey Bogart with
the same role in the latest Holly-
wood retrimming of the old nays-
tery. The picture is directed by
Jﬁn Huston, son of old troupe!‘

‘Walter. V lt is his first attempt
and could be slightly better, yet
inﬁnitely worse.

It sounds like a press-agent's
gag, but the 'sgonso2's of “Johnny
Belinda”. vouch that it is true.

Harry Wagstafl’ Gribble, the
producer with a name like some-
thing from’ Wodehouse, ha s
adopted the unique procedure of
alternating two leading women

in the role of his heroine. The

idea is, that the part is so de-
mandinfg that the young lady

playing the "role has to have 48
hours to recover. Apparently,

the distal? side of Actors’ Equity

work-week.

Helen Craig turned a stunt role
into a radiant performance.

_ But Miss Craig has remained
in New York this year to do
Sheakespean-e’s “As You Like
It,” and her part in the company
which has been hastily assembled
to lteep the road theatres lighted
is divided between Jean Platt and
Dania Kruska.

The central ﬁgure in “Johnny

Note Losses

Decreases of ﬁve to 20 per cent
or more as compared with a year
‘ago mark the enrollment this fall
bffull-time students in a large
majority of American colleges and
universities. This fact is shown by
‘official statements just received
from 573 approved institutions in
all parts of the United States. Of
this total, 391 report fewer stu-
dents, 125 report approximately
the same number, and 117 report
:nore students than a year ago.

In explanation of these sharp
losses, collegiate administrators
cite two factors: the effect of
Selective service regulations, both
 the actual number of men stu-
_dents drafted for military service,
and those anticipating the draft;
and the monetary attraction of in-
glustrial defense jobs. 1

-;The universities
were not asked to
to curricula, but
that‘ enrollment
schools is greatly reduced. Medi-
cal attendance is the highest on
record and enginering depart;
ments likewise are largely attend-
ed. This is due to Selective service
regulations, by which students in
medicine, engineering, and certain
scientiﬁc ﬁelds are eligible for de-
ferment by local draft boards as
“essential men.”

-‘tions in and around Pittsburgh
follow: Pitt, Carnegie Tech, and
Penn State report decreases of
approximately ﬁve per cent; West
Virginia University reports a de-
crease of ten per cent; Pennsyl-
vania College for Women has an
increase of ﬁve per cent; and Du-
’qiuesne"s enrollment remains un-
changed.

measures to protect its collection
of 400,000 volumes from aerial

Sophomores Help
Medical Students

Miss Louisa.Kun s11 Chung of
Honolulu, holder of a master of
zcience degree from the University,
has returned to the Middlesex uni-
versity medical school because of
the medical students who elected
her their class secretary.

Miss Chung, an honor student,
Iiad failed to register this fall, and
upon investigation, the medical
students found that illness in her
family had made it impossible for
herto return to school.

" Each sophomore medical stu-
dent contributed to a fund and the
University joined by offering her
a $100 scholarship and an N_YA

position.

First Lady Wants

Fewer Exemptions

Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt at a
recent informal press conference
answered, “That kind of injustice
leadsito revolution” to the -fol-
lowing question:

“What do you think of the pre-
sent situation in which local draft
boards are handing out umnerited

exemptions, including exemptions

to students merely because they
are economically able to attend
college and to take defense cours-
es with the single aim of getting
relatively safe desk jobs?”

The first lady claimed that such
a practice creates a privilege
class. A privileged class, in turn,
produces class distinction, and
that class distinction is unjust,
sometimes leading to revolution.

She said that since we all know
that some local draft boards are
not what they should be, the
American citizen is responsible to
see that the boards work fairly.

Business Stays

on Stable Basis
For Past Week

Little change in Pittsburgh busi-
ness conditions was recorded last
week, the Bureau of Business Re-
search revealed Friday.

'A moderate drop in trade was
partially counter-balanced by
an increase in freight ship-
ments. lndustrial production re-
mained stable.

In spite of the fact that the
busines index graph showed a drop
of 1.1 per cent below the previous
week, it was a full 18 per cent
over the corresponding week a
year ago.

For the third consecutive week
steel operations remained at 98
per cent of capacity while‘ no
change was reported in the num-
ber of blast furnaces in operation
or electric power production.

River t‘ra.ﬂ’ic increased slightly;
rail shipments dropped consider-
ably less than seasonally.

Due partly to a slump in de-
partment store sales but mostly
to a decided drop in new motor
car registration, the index of
trade reached a new low level.

Despite this fact total sales of
department stores for the four
weeks ending October 18 indicated
a 17 per cent increase over sales
of the same period in 1940.

It’s an awful feeling to be
only 18 and» very thirsty.

One Pitt freshman, who re-
mains anonymous for obvious
reasons, found himself in that
position, and waiters at all the
bars were very ﬁrm in saying
“No!” to his pleas.

And so, being a bright young
man, and in desperate need for
proof that he could drink, he
hopped down to his draft board
and registered.

Then he went merrily about,
getting legally tanked as often
as the whim moved him.

All went wetly well until he
was called up for examination,
when llustered and apparently
tired Army officers discovered
the truth.

There is so much red tape to
unregistering a man, only to
put him back 9n the lists three
years later, that the weary
Army men just put him into
4-F classiﬁcation, which classi-
ﬁcation implies such physical
disrepair that no army would
saddle itself with that kind of

soldier.

Now the thirsty Pitt man has
a registration card, and is safe
from the army.

And three years from now,
everything will probably be all
right too, as at the rate he is
now going, he will quite likely
have drunk himself into 4-F
classification’ by that time.

The method of solving an 1800-
yeur—old 1nys'te1'y will be explaxined
tonight, when Dr. Jotham Johnson,
assistant professor of classics,
speaks in “A Birthday at Dura-
Europos” at the meeting of the
Classical club at 12:30 o’clock in
321 Cathedral.

For hundreds of years archae-
ologists had been puzzled by the
exact nature of the calendar
once used by the ancient Selen-
cid emperors, and its relation to
the Babylonian and Parthian
methods of determining’ dates.‘ '

Dr. Johnson visited the small
town of Dura-Europos on the Eu-
phrates and found on the wall of
what had once been a private house
the scratches of an ancieht astrolo-
ger of the town. '

The marks, dating back to 176
A. D., Dr. Johnson discovered,
were part of an attempt by the
local seer to foretell the life of
a child made on the day the baby
was born. '

Enigma

In his talk, he will describe, in
detail, how he was able to use the
horoscope which he found as the
clue by which he unraveled the
almost 2,000-year-old—mystcry of
the ancient Seleucidian calendar.

ﬁnally removedthe goose-egg from

one in the Stadium rose, all with
indifferent joy, waiting and watch-

shouted, “If Pitt scores now, the
Stadium’s going to read ‘titled’. ”
Seconds later, Johnny Ross crossed
the line. Crys of “No school Mon-

*‘ again, unless the AE&ME fresh-

 

man and sophomores rise up and
smite their brothers down. The

seniors had everything their own
way in their opening game. The
combination of Dave Mamaux,
Marshall ’Wlnkler,. Al Samson, and
“Dusty” Rhodes is one of the best
to play in the engineering loop for
a long time. -»

7’-3.  Mamaux is big and powerful,

yet fast and shifty enough to
to pull passes out of the air with
ease. V./inkler on the other hand
has taken over the spot left
by the graduation of Les Holt.
His long arching passes and his
bullet heaves are the sensations
of the league.

_ With these two on hand to make
lllie miserable‘ for the rest of the
eiigiiiezei-iiig league, it is no won-

der the AE&ME seniors are heavy

favorites to repeat their perform-
ance of last year, and once again
represent the slide-rule boys in
the intra:niuml play—0ﬂ°s.

of relays. The route will begin
at Erie and end in Philadelphia,

covering‘ about 560 miles with
approximately 1200 high_ school
runners participating. Each boy
will run from 100 yards to a
mile.

Running through " Pittsburgh
will come under the jurisdiction

into your mind, the Punks. This
happy-go—lucky bunch of basket-
ball players have dominated in-
tramural football for the past two
years.

They haven’t played any games
to cause
their opponents many unhappy
moments before the curent season
is over. Although five of last

~ \t‘ea.m.

Larry Paffrath, Eddie Ziolkow-
ski, Tay Malarky, Johnny Swacu-s,
and Jimmy Egan are back again
and with them they will probably
have some of the sophomore bas-
ketball hopefuls. These boys play
a wide open brand of football
and are not afraid to rough it.

Now to get ‘to the glamour boys
of intramural football, the fra-
ternity teams. ’

For the second consecutive
season the Phi Cams are again
the defending title holders of
the Greek circuit. This year's
Fiji outfit sports such wellknown
intramural names as Jack Bitner,
“-Chuck” Egan, Kenny Grossett,
Bill Calvin, and Jim Warne. b

Although, awccording to one of
our reporters, the Fijis looked
pretty had even though they won
their opening game, 18-0, we feel
that perhaps this was due to the
earliness of the season. The Fijis
were supposedly outplayed and
lucky to win. However, we shall
see. A '

season is the PiKA seven. They
ran up.26 points in their opening
encounter and showed plenty of
power. Led by the Wilde broth-
ers, Ralph and Gus, the PiKA’s
present an up and coming power
in the fraternity league, and
should cause a lot of headaches
before the current campaign
ends. _

All in all it looks like this year
should be one of the best in in-
tramural‘ history. With players
like Mamaux, Winkler, Grossett,

“In the lROQU0lS BLOCK”

By ELAINE KAHN

(Editor’s note: This is the sec-
ond in (L series of a.rt'icl€:s bay mem-
bers of the football’ squad explain-
ing their position to the fun) :1

It was the lasthome game of
the 1940 season. Pitt was playing
its traditional. rival Penn State
who had brought her undefeated
Lions to this Stadium in which
they had never won a game. I
was just one more sophomore
warming the bench. Suddenly the
coach motioned to me, “Waist,”
he said, “go in at quarterback_.”’

For one minute I felt wonder-
ful, for the bench had 
crowded with eligible seniors.‘ Arid
then I was scared to death. Here
I was a . raw sophomore going to
start at quarterback in one of the
most important games of the year.
I had reason to be ‘terriﬁed for
the quarterback is to football what
the catcher is to baseball.

He calls the plays. He is head
coach once the team"? is on _._the
ﬁeld and his word is law. Thus,
one of the first qualities of a good
quarterback islthat he have the
conﬁdence of his teammates, for
his judgment must go unques-
tioned.‘ i e ~

Memory is equally important to
the quarterback. For every hun-
dred plays of my own I must also
know a like number for each of
the other ten members of my
team. I constantly carry with‘ me
a book that contains all the plays.
This book requres more study
than the most involved textbook.

The quarterback must be men-
tally alert, able in a split second
to distinguish between a running
or passing attack, or "to note who
makes a tackle when one of his

’ men fails to carry out the blocking

assignment properly. Speed is an
essential, for he must lead the in-
terference and nearly always keep

A good voice is pretty 
of a necessity, for the quarters}
hack must make his signals

It is importantpthat the quaritepi-i
back be ,strong‘ and rugged, lest
he spend most of the game in. 
in.-ﬁormary, for he draws.  the 1
blocking assignments. Under the
Pitt system he never carries the

For .- those who have obvious
difficulties in writing, instruction
in handwork, drawing or carpen-
tering is provided.

Visual difficulties are shown
by several symptoms such as
extensive blinking, holding the
book unusually close or far
away, or by skipping words and
lines. .To develop visual abili-
ties, books with large print are
employed and liners are used to
keep the place and direct the
eye movement. ’

Children who have articulation
difficulties often hesitate to read
aloud. To correct this they are
asked to repeat jingles or imitate
sounds. In some cases the child is'
helped with the particular sound
