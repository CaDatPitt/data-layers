Hungarian Consul’ at Cleveland.
They are plans for one of the two

Room ﬂoorof the” Cathedral.
— Both plans are essentially suit-

huge stove, cabinets, benches and’
pictures of famous Hungarian per-
sonages, and of the four rivers and
hills of Hungary.-

The other by Professor Dennis-
Gyorgyl emphasizes‘ the more formal
aspect of the classroom. in its
baroque furniture of massive oak,-
historical friezes and panelled ceil-

Final choice,"which must ‘ be made
by June‘ ‘1,’is left‘ with the 'Hunga-

With the grass green on the sta-
dium field. the coaches and players
silent, the Pitt Panther gradually

' turns his attention toward the foot-

ball season of 1930. A squad of
probably twenty-four ‘veterans and
sixteen freshmen of last year will
report to Camp Hamilton in Sep-
tember to begin the ﬁnal drills be-

In Semi-Final Stage

Due to ‘thee inclement weather’ of
the past"? week, most of the- matches
scheduled in the interfraternity ten-
nis tournament were postponed.
Some of these matches were played
oif, however, with the result that
the teams were able to engage in
their’ semi-ﬁnal ma.tc;h'es yesterday.

Three of the postponed matches
were played off on Thursday. Phi
Delta_Theta easily defeated the Sig-
ma Chis, 6-3, 6-0, 6-2, 6-1. This vic-
tory enabled the winner to enter the‘
quarter-ﬁnals where. they played the
Pi Epsilon Phi boys. The Theta, Chis
also "had an easy timein defeating
the Omega Delts, while the Kappa
Sigs tookpover the Delta1Tau Deltas.

The Phi Gems, led by Charley
Hyatt, defeated the Pi Lame in the
hardest fought match to date’. The
scores were 6-3, 6-2, 0-6, 1-6, 12-10,
