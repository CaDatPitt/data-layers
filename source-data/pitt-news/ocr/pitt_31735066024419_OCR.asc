diversity group
aims to increase

Pitt’s awareness
Byjulie Sabol

News Assistant

By sponsoring open forums, speakers
and events, a newly formed Student
Government Board-organized committee
hopes to increase awareness of the diversity
on campus. ' .

Members from the Black Action Society;
the Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Alliance;
Students Against Racism and the SGB
voiced their concerns about poor
acceptance of diversity at Pitt.

The committee said there are few
cultural—diversity programs throughout the
year.‘Cultural awareness should not stop
at the end of the September Cultural
Diversity week, SGB member Barbara
Rodriguez said.

“Cultural Diversity Week is great, but it
should continue throughout the whole
year. The interest is there,” said Rodriguez,
one of the board members organizing the
committee. ‘ ‘ ~ /

The group also wants to hold open

forums each month. Forums give people i

to chance to “open communication lines

' and voice, their concerns,” said Matt Sipple

of SIAR. A . .

The committee is planning an open,
forum for March, including a nationally
known speaker as well as a student panel.
An all—day festival with booths sponsored
by student organizations, music and food
from around the world was also suggested.

Also proposed were open three—day
cultural—diversity weekends similar to those

Asian studies department celebrates hinese New Year

By Mike Laughlin I
Staff Writer

Pitt’s Asian studies department
honored a 4,690—year-old Chinese
tradition last night in Forbes
Quadrangle.

The Chinese New Year was
celebrated by a group of students
and professors. Many of those
attending were Asian studies and
language majors who wanted
firsthand exposure to Chinese
culture.

“It’s another part of the
Curriculum, absorbing the

culture,’’ saidJeffDaun, a graduate
student in Asian studies.

“It’s a great way to meet Chinese
people and get exposure to their
language,” said Hang Lai, a senior
majoring in Chinese.’-The
gathering also gave Hang, who is
Vietnamese, a chance to celebrate
the New Year, as other cultures
in Asia celebrate the New Year in
a similar manner. '

The new year is the most
important holiday to the Chinese,
according to Jonathan Wolff,
associate director of the Asian
studies program. It involves large

family reunions and marks the
beginning of the agricultural cycle,
which caused the holiday to be
tied closely to spring.
Traditional ways of celebration

vary from province to province.

Food is a central part of the
celebration, and certain foods
have special significance, such as
carp, which was associated with
attaining riches in the new year.

Another tradition is decorating
the home with couplets, pieces
of paper with sayings on them.
Some are meant to bring luck
into a home, and others were

’ meant to ward off evil spirits.

Red envelopes of money, called
“I-Iongbaos,” are given out by the
grandparents to all unmarried
relatives in the family.

Parades are sometimes -held
that involve lion dancing, or
dragons and unicorns. The young
men wearing the costumes are
usually martial arts students, and
sometimes firecrackers are used
in the parade to keep evil spirits
away.

The event gave Chinese foreign
exchange students and professors
a chance to celebrate the New

Year in their traditional manner,
said several of the participants. It
helps to ease the pain of being
separated from family back.in
their homeland.

Mary Liu, curator of the
Chinatown Historical Museum in
New York City, spoke at the
celebration yesterday. Thomas
Rimer, chair of the Asian studies
department, suggested inviting
Liu to give a lecture so the guests

could enjoy something different?

rather than the usual potluck
dinner.

University receives $2 million to replace steam lines

By Mike Laughlin
Staff Wﬁter

Pitt received a $2 million state grant for
a long overdue construction job to replace
deteriorating steam lines serving several
campus buildings and to expand steam
service. The project will be completed in
August.

Laura Zullo of Facilities Management
said the project is necessary to ensure the
efficiency of the steam system. Steam

provides heating and hot water for many
of Pitt’s buildings.

“When it snows, you can see a path from
Heinz Chapel to Clapp Hall,” said Zullo,
illustrating how much the steam lines
have deteriorated.

Escaping steam from the line that goes
from the chapel toward Clapp Hall causes
snow to melt in that area on the Cathedral
of Learning lawn.

The biggest part of the project involves
construction of a steam tunnel beneath

Fifth Avenue. Zullo said no re—routing of
traffic is expected because workers will be
jackhammering the tunnel entirely
underneath the street.

Three contractors were awarded the
project. The bidding on the contract was
handled by the state and given to the
lowest bidders.

Rather than just burying the steam lines
underground, they will be placed inside
enclosed concrete trenches, Zullo said.
This will protect the pipes and give them

longer life spans.

Another project is planned to replace
steam lines serving the upper campus and
the medical center. According to Zullo, no
deadline hasbeen set and no money has
been budgeted, although construction is
scheduled for the summers of 1992 and
1993. 4

Pitt gets its steam from the Belleﬁeld
Boiler Plant in Panther Hollow. The
university spent $4 million last Yea’ 0“
steam.

  oping on Campus

Students should learn to put failure in perspective

Signiﬁcant failure is a difficult
thing to face in a society that idol-
izes success. Yet failing is some-
thing that we all experience. We
accept the statement that “to err
is human, ” yet we tend to be hard
on ourselves for our own failures.

Many students I’ve spoken with
over the years have become
despondent or extremely upset
because they received a low grade
in a class, had a relationship turn
sour, or were rejected by their
preferred fraternity or sorority.
All felt that they were failures and
had lost faith in the belief that
they would ever again achieve
anything worthwhile.

The mistake these students
made was that instead of seeing
themselves as people who had
“failed at something,” they saw
themselves as “failures.” Even
when some of the things we fail '
at are significant to us, we need
to work at separating the failure

    

., / 
 / /

Dr: Robe
Gallagher

cal

from who we are as people.
When we see ourselves as
failures, we become demoralized
and lose our hope for the future.
On the other hand, when we
accept the fact that we didn’t
achieve our goal this particular

time, we can forgive ourselves,
move on and set the stage for
future success. '
Unfortunately, separating
ourselves from our success or
failure is not always easy to do.
One of the most common
responses to failure is guilt or
self-blame. Guilt eats away at our
feelings of self-worth and inhibits
our desire for new challenges.
It is important to put failure

into perspective. We need to
review our past successes, and
take note of those that were built
on earlier disappointments.
Failure almost always has
something to teach us that can be
used in the future. Many
successful people report that they
have had a significant failure that
propelled them into their chosen
areas of achievement. Many of
the most successful love stories
followed on the heels of an earlier
failed relationship.

Failure provides us with an
opportunity to learn something
about ourselves. It can help us to
reassess our goals or to redirect
our energies. Failure can also
help us to become more aware of
our humanness and link us more
closely with others.

Often, after a severe
disappointment, we discover for
the first time the importance of
friends and family who are usually
quick to rally around us. Nobody

can take away the pain of a «

traumatic failure, but_ if we can
come through it with courage,
we will be stronger for the
experience and better equipped
to move on to new challenges.
The other positive thing about
failure is that it gives us something

to talk about in later years when .

we want to brag to our kids about
all the impossible obstacles we
had to overcome to achieve our
present status.

Blue and Gold Society
to improve Pitt’s image

By George Kopec
For The Pitt News

Students can boost Pitt's image locally by appplying to the
new Blue and Gold Society.

At an information session held in Craig Hall last week, 30
students learned about the proposed program.

Two students from the University of South Florida’s
Ambassadors, a similar program, were on hand to give a
first-hand look at the responsibilities the society will
involve. ~

Mae Marie Padios, who has been a USF Ambassador for three
years, said, “We are the first impression people get of the
university, so we do serve an important purpose.”

The Ambassadors program at USF was started in 1979 by Lee
Patouillet, then the associate vice president of alumni affairs.
Patouilletbecame executive director of Pitt’s Alumni Association
in July 1991 and realized that a similar program was needed
here.

According to Patouillet, “Pitt is very well known outside of the
region, but it isn’t as respected right here.”

Patouillet said that the students are instrumental in changing
Pitt's local image, and that they will benefit personally as well.
“A good reputation increases the value of your degree,” he
said.

Some of the students who attended said the Blue and Gold
Society can also help overcome student apathy. ‘

Sara Shaiman, a junior majoring in liberal studies and elementary
education, said, “The society is important because we're changing
attitudes of incoming freshmen. They are often afraid to do
things. We need to get them motivated.”

Danielle Roe, a first-year political science major, said she
came to the meeting because she wants ,“to try to promote a
better image for Pitt.”

Michelle Gross, a junior communications major, agreed.

“I hope I can make an improvement for the school, and it
sounds like a good way to meet a lot of new people,” Gross
said. .

Alumni Coordinator Maryjean Lovett said the society will
achieve these objectives through a number of activities.

“Its members will represent the student body at various
university community and alumni functions, in addition to
hosting alumni during homecoming weekend, reunion weekend
and during our National Alumni Leaders Conference,” she said.

Other duties may include giving campus tours or appearing
at high schools for orientation seminars. . '

Interested students may still obtain applications from Lovett
at the Alumni Relations office, located on the third floor of Craig
Hall, 200 South Craig Street. Applications must be submitted by
Feb. 12, and students who have been selected will be notified
by mail in early April.

Carnegie ’s Pennsylvania room
archive of commonwealth ’s past

By John Temple
For T be Pitt News

Bright strips of sunshine lay
across the desk of a man poring
through the Pennsylvania Room’s
copy of the “Morton Allen
Directory of European Steamship
Arrivals.”

That reading material may be a
bit dry for most non-genealogists,
but there is a lot of not—so-obscure
information to be found in the
Pennsylvania Department of the
Oakland branch of the Carnegie
Library. Books, photos, maps and
newspaper clippings devoted to
Pennsylvania, especially the
Pittsburgh area, are housed in
this department.

The employees of the room
answered over 100,000 questions
last year about the state, most of
which focused on western
Pennsylvania and its inhabitants.

“The questions go from the
sublime to the ridiculous,” said
Maria Zini, the director of the
department. Adoptees often call
trying to trace their natural
parents, she said. ‘

“And one person called asking

Nome:

when Halley’s comet passed over
Pittsburgh,’.’ said Adrienne
McConville, who was working at
the front desk.

Although the Pennsylvania
Department wasn’t established
until 1928, the Carnegie has been
clipping news items and other
material since approximately

I 1900. The result is several rows of

filing cabinets containing
thousands of files of clippings
about Pennsylvania and its
personalities.

“We’re lagging right now
because of lack of staff, but we
usually clip articles about three
to six months after they’re
published,” Zini said. “We have
certain librarians assigned to Clip
certain newspapers.”

The files contain clips from the
local newspapers and other
articles brought to their attention.

“We have to be subjective about
what we clip. We do not include
everything on Pittsburgh,” Zini
said. “When you’ve worked in
the room for a while and you
know what people ask for, it
gives you a feeling for what to
Clip.”

UNIVERSITY OF PHVSBUFIGN
 

MEMBERSHIP DRIVE

Another popular feature of the
room is its file of 30,000 photos.
Photos can be purchased for the
amount it takes to make a copy.

Most of the buyers are
publishers who need pictures of
Pittsburgh’s buildings, people and
events, but some just want the
pictures for personal use,
especially the sports photos, Zini
said.

According to Zini, the largest
group of patrons are people
searching for their family tree.
“Although genealogy used to be
a hobby for people with very old
families,.it has become something
for everybody now,” she said.

Students researching local
topics often use the room to find
demographic or political
information or to trace the
evolution of the city. But very
often researchers use the

biography card catalog or the ,_

files to find information on people,
Zini said.

“We get a lot of questions on
people who have not been written
up in booksyet,” she said. “Our
files sort of fill the gap between

YMCA oﬂers progm ms
for university students

By Jenn Spagnuolo
For The Pitt News

Since 1905 the Collegiate YMCA
has given Pitt students the chance
to volunteer their time to the

~community. The YMCA of

Pittsburgh provides a professional
staff to guide the students as they
direct a variety of programs.

This year the YMCA at Pitt,
Duquesne and the University of
Detroit will be providing the
chance for students to perform
services for the Appalachian
community in West Virginia.
Students will visit the Nazareth
Farm during spring break to help
with the construction of houses,
aid in food banks and work on
local farms.

The newest addition to the
many programs the YMCA has to
offer is Oakland Recreation, a
service to unite Pitt students with
the youth of Oakland.

The program includes
swimming at Carlow College,
roller skating and community

service.

Collegiate YMCA Program
Director Gloria Townsend said
that “all students should take
advantage of volunteerism.”

“Giving back to the community
is very important for all of us
because of the way volunteerism
makes you feel you’ve made a
difference," she said.

Students who are also interested
in psychology, social work or
criminal justice can visit the
Allegheny County Shuman Center
forjuvenile Detention. Volunteers
spend one hour per week with
the youth at Shuman Center
playing cards or games.

The YMCA offers tutoring and
support services for women who
have been recently released from
prison.

Tutoring services are also
provided for area grade school
students ranging in age from five
to 16 years old at the Lower Hill
YMCA.

The Pitt Collegiate YMCA is
located in the William Pitt Union.

Lawyer explains HIV confidentiality

By Michael King
Sta,ﬂ‘W1-iler

Health-care workers’ access to the HIV-status
of their patients will be limited under the HIV-
Related Information Act recently passed in
Pennsylvania. V

Pittsburgh attorney David M. Korman, who
specializes in AIDS-related litigation and is a
volunteer for the Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force,
spoke at Pitt’s law school last week.

Before discussing the HIV-Related Information
Act, Korman explained the importance of the
latency period, or the time between being
infected and testing HIV-positive.

“The most prevalent viewpoint for the latency
period is six to eight months,” he said.

This latency period played an integral role in
the shaping of the act, Korman said.

“If someone tests negative today, all that
means is they weren't infected more than six
months ago. They could have been infected
yesterday and be a carrier,” he said.

Korman explained there are three main parts
to the act: voluntary testing, involuntary testing
and the confidentiality of records.

For voluntary testing to occur, the health-care
worker must have written consent for HIV
testing of drawn blood.

Pre-test as well as post-test counseling must
be provided, and a confirmatory test must be
done before telling the patient the results are
positive.

Korman said the reason post-test counseling
must occur is because of the latency period.
Patients could test negative but still be a carrier
if risky behavior occurred less than six months
ago.

“The media said Magic Johnson’s wife and
child tested negative, but it’s too early to tell,”
Korman said. ’

CWO to concentrate on abortionissue

By Kathy Kmiecik
stag Writer

The need to focus strongly on the pro-choice movement
is first on Pitt’s Campus Women’s Organization agenda
for this term.

Although the organization is concerned with many
different women’s issues, the recent decision by the
Supreme Court to rule on a Pennsylvania law that restricts
abortion rights makes pro-choice issues very important to
the group right now, according to CWO co-president
Holly Callender.

“CWO is really interested in a diversity of women’s
issues. We don’t feel pro-choice is more important than
domestic violence or rape. It’s just that right now our
freedom is a pressing issue. We need to focus our
attentions on pro-choice this semester,” Callender

Although information on
the current and well known
is most often sought-after,
the unknown and deceased
are recorded here also.
Obituary notices have been
clipped daily since 1968,
and an earlier set of notices,
dating from the 18th
century to 1913, is on
microfilm.

Pennsylvania journals,
directories and law books
line the peach-colored
walls underneath the high,
arched windows of the
large room. Although the
department moved to this
more spacious area on the
second floor of the

Carnegie Library three years
ago, there still are space
problems.

“That’s a very difficult
thing for most libraries,”
Zini said. “With the
expansion of materials,
space becomes a real

premium.”
But the employees of the

The march is being sponsored by the National

CWO is also preparing an information table
that will be set up in the William Pitt Union on
Feb. 10.

The group will provide information on many different
women’s issues, including the pro-choice movement,
sexual assault and contraception.

Sign—up sheets will also be available for the Washington

CWO’s next meeting will be Feb. 10, at8:30 p.m. in the

Chinese

Continued from page 1
Liu spoke about Chinese immigration to the

United States in the late 19th and early 20th
centuries. She described how many Chinese
immigrants could only find work in hand laundries,
an earlier version of the modern dry cleaner.

Life in the hand laundries was very harsh on the
new immigrants, causing many of them to become
disillusioned with life in America, Liu said. The
average worker would put in a 16 to 18 hour
workday and earn three to five cents for every shirt
washed and ironed, according to Liu.

Her lecture included a video of interviews with
Chinese immigrants who described their own lives
and the lives of their ancestors in America. Many

Childcare necessary

Pitt students seem to get lost in the shuffle to make
money and win prestige for our “thriving” university.

In addition to such concerns as overcrowded classrooms,
diversity in education and an equally representative voice

-in the decision-making processes, more specific issues

about day-to-day student life are just as casually neglected.
For some the lack of nighttime library hours is troubling.
For others the omission of students from daytime university-

- parking privileges is just as inconvenient.

And for a growing number of nontraditional and graduate
students, the lack of adequate and affordable child care
has become as big an issue as finding the money to pay
tuition. V

In 1984, then-President Wesley Posvar released a study
from a “Working Group on Child Care” which narrowed
the service of child care at Pitt solely to faculty and staff
members, typically eliminating the special needs of some
students from its deliberations.

Across the nation, child care for students is becoming a
growing trend on American campuses. Robert Corrigan,
chancellor of the University of Massachusetts at Boston,
said, “As individuals confront the increasing complexities
of American society  higher education becomes more
important than it has been at any other time in our history.
It is no longer ‘nice to have,’ ‘a, privilege for the privileged’
or ‘the thing to do’ after high school. It is a necessity ifone
is determined to be a productive member in many segments
of ourwork force.”

'I‘ruly, there are many people now being encouraged to
go to college who in the past may not have thought about
attending. With the lofty notion of collegiate education
comes the piercing reality of daily existence.

It is enough just to afford overpriced textbooks and
irrelevant computer fees. It is time Pitt considers the needs
of student parents.

'l'he Coalition for Child Care at Pitt cites that, for students,
the need for full-time day care at Pitt is not so much at issue
as reasonably priced, accessible, part-time day care, so
students can leave their children for an hour or two during
classes and then pick them up when classes are over.

Steve Parks, a member of the Coalition, said, “At the
Coalition for Child Care’s Tape-In, one of the things that
came across is the desperation of the student parent. One
of the parents said that she would give up her discounts to
football games, the discount to PPC events, even access to
student-health benefits in exchange for 10 hours of
affordable child care a week. I think [President]. Dennis]
O'Connor has tapped into a real emotional problem. My
hope is that he doesn’t cut the students off at the knees like
Posvar did.” '

Student Health addresses the basic well-being of students.
It is time the university recognize the needs of students that
happen to be parents.

Language not key to understanding

All too often I hear students complain about
having instructors who don’t have a good command
of the English language. They leave class making

comments like, “How can that person teach this class

if he can’teven speak the language?” More commonly
they make some sort of degrading comment toward
the instructor's culture and ethnicity.

To be honest, I agree with the sentiments that an
instructor should have a good command of the English
language before being able to teach. Nevertheless,
making degrading comments about one ’s ethnicity is
inexcusable.

The issue here goes far beyond ridiculing the

certain politicians think, we should not shut off other
cultu res and become isolationists. History has taught
us that ‘culture bashing’ can have serious
repercussions. ’ l ‘

I think it would be wise to listen to Goethe, who
said, “You will always find [hatred] strongest and
most violent where there is the lowest degree of
culture.” Rather than being culturally sensitive for a
self—centered and" financial reason, why can’t we
simply be tolerant for its own sake? The idea of a
libera'l—arts education is to expose students to new
ideas and beliefs. Yetfor some strange reason students
don’t seem to be opening themselves to new things.

professor who doesn’t have a good
grasp of the English language, or
who just has a heavy accent. The
issue here is cultural sensitivity.
Cultural insensitivity exhibited by

Brett  
Gilman

Rather they are becoming less
accepting and more close-rninded.

I don’t dispute the fact
that cultural differences impose a
potent barrier between people. It

the students on this campus is, for
the most part, commonplace. ,
A recent survey conducted by the University Center

for International Studies at Pitt showed that many’

CAS students don't view cultural awareness as a
priority. Many said that the outside world has very
little impact on their career goals and that it makes
very little difference if they are culturally aware or
not.

Wake up, people! Due to the fact that the world is
a more interdependent place, both financially and
socially, the United States is no longer the No. 1
country in the world. The term “U.S. dominance” is a
thing of the past. Learn from the mistakes of American
business, and move on with the times. Stop thinking
ethnocentrically. '

For one thing, the growth of multinational
corporations and the growing global economy has

' more organizations doing business abroad than ever

before. Europe ‘s dream of a common market catering
to 320 million people is now a reality, and the powerful
Asian markets are known to us all too well. If nothing
else, cultu ral sensitivity will allow us to operate in the
world market more easily.

It only makes sense to recognize cultural differences,
since we have to think globally. Contrary to what

is difficult trying to understand our
own culture without having toworry aboutsomebody
else’s. This doesn’t mean, howevergthat we should
be closed-minded and intolerant. All worthwhile
things in life are a bit difficult.

This is a country with its foundations built on
diversity. Trying to understand other cultures will
make it that much easier for us to understand our
own. '

I don’t expect individuals to read a book titled
“Everything You Need to Know About Every Different
Culture in the World” — but they should try to
understand that behind each person is a vast and
complicated culture.

Culture is responsible, in a sense, for everyone’s

actions. Try to remember that most of your parents _

and grandparents, at one time or another, suffered
an unjustifiable backlash because they were the
“Wops,” “Limeys” or “Kikes” responsible for the
world’s problems.

And keep in mind, the next time you make some
sort of degrading ethnic comment, remember that
the foreign TA you ridiculed today could be
interviewing you for a job tomorrow.

Brett Gilman is a columnist forfhe Pitt News.

Co-opting black culture reinforces prejudice

I find Brian Berger's rap
commenta ries offensive. They are

rap music because he does not

full of the stereotypical "hip—hop”
terms, which he seems to feel
[are] necessary to talk about rap.
I would not be offended if that
was a part of Mr. Berger's culture,
but it is not. He seems to think
that the only way to understand
rap is in a watered—down version
of black slang (i.e. the language
used by a lot of African
descendants, especially the youth,
in describing our music). But it is

Letters

not. Rap can be talked about in
any way, not just, “Yo, homey,
what up? Yeah, Cube’s beat is
jackin’ an’ mackin'."

I find this type of commentary
racist as well. African descendants
do not talk in such a triﬂing way,
even when we talk about rap. I'm
just saying that Mr. Berger has a
tendency to overexaggerate the
terms he uses in commenting on

_share the culture in which rap

music was intended. And believe
it or not, it is rather difficult for
me, an African-American who
loves rap music and culture, to
understand Mr. Berger.

So to ﬁx this, I hope The Pitt -

News would get a person that
shares the African-American
culture to comment on rap music

and artists.

Women capture Pitt Invitational

By John Labriola

Sta_[f Writer

Pitt’s women’s gymnastics team
captured its first win of the season
last Saturday at Trees Hall during
the Pitt Invitational with 181.35
points.

Finishing second in the
competition was the University
of Rhode Island (179.30). Taking
third was the University of
Massachusetts (179.25), and
bringing up the rear was Ball
State University (178.70).

The Invitational was arranged
such that all four teams were
competing at the same time on
different events. Although this
makes the competition harder to

, follow and harder to catch all of

the individual scores, it allows
the competition to ﬂow smoothly
without any stops.

Pitt began the competition with
the vaulting exercises. Pitt’s
vaulting squad scored 44.45
points, with its highest-scoring
vault (9.20) coming from
newcomer Alisha Friend.

Pitt’s vaulting squad has been

V undergoing substantial changes.

Head coach Debbie Yohman has
narrowed down her vaulting
lineup to bring out strong,
constant vaulters.

She has also added newer and
more difficult vaults_for Pitt this

Kristin Brown came in second to teammate Alisha Friend in the vault. season,

“We don’t have our nice,
average vaults that we do cleanly,”
Yohman said. “Our vaults are a
little bit harder, but we performed
them a little bit cleaner this week.”

Pitt progressed to the uneven
parallel bars during the second
round of the competition.
Although Pitt experienced several
falls from the bars, it performed
stronger than it has in past weeks.
According to Yohman, even
though some of the girls fell
during portions of their routines,
they performed parts of their
routines that they have been
experiencing difficulty with
cleanly.

Pitt’s bar squad tabulated 44.20
points. Strong performances came
from Friend (9.30), Kristin Brown
(9.15), Jeannie Vecchio (8.85),
Jen Butkovich (8.50) and Gina
Venezia (8.40){

The third round of the
competition (the balance beam)
emulated the second round for
the Lady Panthers. The Pitt beam
squad" has been having some
difficulty stay_ing on the beam.
According to Yohman, the
routines have been clean and
have been earning good scores,
but the girls have not been staying
on.

“They were very clean when
they were on the beam with only
one fall apiece,” Yohman said.
“We lost some bonus points, but

still they kept it clean.”
Pitt’s final event was the ﬂoor

exercises. In the past, floor“

exercises has been one of Pitt’s
strongest events, and Saturday's
performance echoed past
performances. Pitt’s floor squad
tallied 47.15 points and had the
top four scores of the competition
on the floor. Top scores for “Pitt
Floor” came from Brown (9.65),
Friend (9.60), Jorgensen (9.60),
Venezia (9.50) and Tracy Jung
(8.80).

“I’m so excited about ﬂoor,”
Yohman s_aid. “Tracy did a

wonderful job. She’s going to go ‘'

9.0 before she graduates this year.”
According to Yohman, the
reason that Pitt’s floor routines
came together during this meet
was because the girls kept their
tumbling passes tight until the
end of their routines and kept
their dances clean as well..

The Lady Panthers" next
performance will be at the Cat
Classic at the University of
Missouri. The competition will
run Feb. 7 and 8. The Lady
Panthers’ next appearance at
Trees Hall will be on Feb. 15 in a
dual meet with Pitt’s men's
gymnastics team. During that
meet Pitt will be taking on the
Golden Flashes and the Lady
Flashes of Kent State University.
The meet is scheduled for 1 p.m.
Admission is free with a Pitt ID.

Men’ s gymnastics earn second place at Shenandoah Valley

By Jeremy Swarbrick
Staﬂ“ Writer

The Pitt men's gymnastics team,
hampered already by early season injuries,
brought home a second-place finish this

pastweekend at the Shenandoah Valley‘

Invitational Gymnastics Meet, held atJames
Madison University.

The College of William and Mary finished
first with a team total of 267.60 points.
Pitt’s score of 255.45 was good enough for
second place. Behind Pitt was the host
team,James Madison (253.70), and Radford
University (245.65).

The meet was the second of Pitt’s young
season, a Season which has provided as
much work for the team’s trainers as it has
for the athletes themselves.

In their first meet, the Panthers lost their
No. 1 all—around performer, Genero
Severino, who suffered a broken leg.
Besides some other minor injuries, head
coach Frank D’Amico also said that a few
of his gymnasts are getting over the ﬂu.

“We are coming off of a lot of injuries.
Since the injury to Genero, things have
been tough. We are not as deep now,”
D’Amico said. “Dave Bausmith is our top
performer now. Also Kyle MacBeth is very

good, and Stuart Yoss is dependable. The
bulk of our team is still there,” he said.
Pitt’s Bausmith was the team’s top
performer with an all-around total of 53. 10
points. His’ score was good enough’ to
place him second overall. In the individual
events, Bausmith took first place on the
parallel bars, scoring 9.00 points. He also
went on to take first place on the still rings
(9.15) and second place on the pommel
horse (9.10). _
On the horizontal bars, MacBeth placed
second, scoring 8.85 points. He also
finished fifth on the parallel bars (8.70).
Also placing for Pitt in individual

competition was Dave Englert, who scored
8.85 points, which was good enough for a
fourth—place finish.

D’Amico said that before the meet he.

felt the team had “an outside chance’ to
win.” Pitt has won this meet the past two
years it has competed. Pitt’s record now
stands at 3~1.

Pitt’s next meet will be Saturday at 1
p.m. at Trees Hall against two of the teams
that Pitt saw in competition in this last
meet: James Madison and Radford
University. D’Amico said he feels that.it
will be good for the team to get home and
compete in a familiar gym. '

Pitt hockey devilish to Saints; brawl with Ice Dukes

By John Labriola
S ta_[)" W11 ter

The Pitt hockey team took on
both the .Duquesne University
Ice Dukes and the Saints of Penn
State University at McKeesport
this past weekend and skated
awaywith a 6-6 tie and an 11-6
win.

On Sunday the Panthers hosted
and gouged the Saints at Golden
Mile Ice Center in'Monroevi1le.
The Saints came into this
competition resembling the
Christians that were led into the
arena to be devoured by the lions
(or in this case the Panthers).

Pitt’s hockey team set the pace
for the competition early on in
the game. Both teams displayed
the differences in the entire first
period.

The Pitt squad assaulted the
Saints’ goaltender five times and
came away with four goals. The
PSUW squad made 12 attempts at

Pitt’s goaltender, Dan Bratkovich,
and was unsuccessful.

Pitt once again proved that it
also could take more penalties
than its opponents. During the

first period Pitt took three

penalties, two of which were
earned by defenseman Steve
Karas.

The Panthers were able to hold
the Saints scoreless during the
first period, but that changed
during the second period. Four
of PSUW’s six goals were scored
during the second round of the
competition. Although the
Panthers also scored four goals
during the second, they found
themselves in the penalty box
more often than on the ice. Pitt
earned five of the eight penalties
assessed during the second
period.

The third period of the game
never heard the ﬁnal horn blow,
because the officials impeded the
game with :31 left to play. By the

end of the game tempers on both
teams had gotten to the point of
explosion. The referees had
broken up two fights and the
beginning of a third when they
decided to terminate the game.
Scoring summary: First
Period — 2:55 Pitt, Bill Crousey;
6:49 Pitt, Crousey; 8:30 Pitt, Deron
Stock; 12:19 Pitt, Don Fedor.
Second Period —- 0:29 Pitt,

‘Dennis Scanlon; 2:58 PSUW,

Branton; 6:36 PSUW, Ulnay; 10:35
Pitt, Vic DiSanti; 11:58 Pitt, Stock;
12:42 PSUW, Pollard; 15:03 Pitt,
Kip Linse; 15:28 PSUW, Ulnay;
2:05 PSUW, Robinson; 5:47
PSUW, Nickoliason; 6:32 Pitt,
DiSanti; 9:19 Pitt, Crousey; 16:19
Pitt, Fedor.

On Friday night the Panthers
took on the Ice Dukes at the Civic
Area and barely came away with
their teeth intact. During the
course of the game the Panthers
seemed to be barely holding their
own against the Ice Dukes.

Although the Panthers netted
the first goal, the Ice Dukes set
the pace for the game. That pace
was violent. 3

The Duquesne squad amassed
15 penalties for a total of 48
minutes, and a game—misconduct
call was leveled against its
assistant coach, Chris Vaccarro,
for being abusive to the game
officials after the game. The
Panthers on the other hand took
10 penalties for a total of 22
minutes.

Pitt started the competition by
netting the first goal of the
competition at 5:24. Scoring for
Pitt was Deron Stock with an
assist going to Brent Spitzer.

The Dukes followed the
Panthers’ goal with one netted at
13:23, only to have Crousey score
off Scott Giordano and Fedor.

The Duquesne squad opened
the second period with two
consecutive goals, and the
Panthers closed out the scoring

for the period with a goal netted
by Fedor off Karas and Crousey.

The third period was the most
physical of the night. The Ice
Dukes cut to the chase and netted
two consecutive goals at the start
of the period, but they could not
hold the Panthers back.

Pitt came back a minute after
Duquesne’s second goal to put in

two goals of its own. Scoring for

Pitt was Giordano and Fedor,
with assists going to Crousey and

1 Giordano.

At the 15:32 mark the Ice Dukes
netted their sixth goal of the
evening. The Panthers’ captain,
Koval, netted the Panthers’sixth
goal to end the competition in a
tie. '

The Panthers will be splitting
this coming weekend. On
Saturday the Panthers will be
traveling to Meadville to face off
against the Rockets of Slippery
Rock University. Faceoff is set for
9:15 p_.m.

Steelers need to take advantage of Plan-B 

Ryan
Buncher

I’m confused. (So what else is
new?) This Plan-B stuffin the NFL
doesn’t make sense to me.

Every team in the league leaves
unprotected a certain number of
players it can most afford to lose.
Any team in the league except
the Steelers can sign them. Why
are the Steelers singled out?

Isn't it bad enough that their
offense suffered the curse of Joe
Walton for the last two years and
they just lost head coach Chuck
Noll?

Yeah, i know.

The Steelers really are allowed
to sign Plan-B free agents. They
iust don’t. Actually, their grasp of
the whole process seems
qtstestionable.

Donald Evans, an undersized
defensivre end who seems allergic
to rushing the passer, is protected.

Linebacker David Little, a year
removed from a Pro Bowl season,
isn't?

If the logic behind it is that
nobody will want him because of
his age (33), why is 34-year-old
offensive tackle Tunch Ilkin on
the protected list?

What about Warren Williams?
He has a career average of 4.8
yards per carry, rarely fumbles
and stays healthy.

I guess the Steelers prefer injury-
and fumble—prone yet
unproductive backs like Tim
\X/orley. Maybe the drug problem
is just an added bonus or
something.

Still, the Steelers really do have
a chance to improve themselves.
The best of the Plan-B free agents
includes players near the ends of
their careers.

But why not fill in a few gaps
—— even for one year? Remember:
This team missed the playoffs by
only one game each of the last
two years.

View of oz ‘dirty’ Pitt boc/eey game

John
Labriola

Please, somebody, douse me
with water — I need a bath. This
weekend was a bit too dirty for
me.

After this weekend, I thought I
would take a look in my old
Webster's Dictionary and find out
the true definition of
sportsmanship. According to
Noah, sportsmanship means: “1.
archaic: skill or an instance of
skillful performance in some

sport. 2: conduct becoming to a ~ unfortunatelylwentto the wrong-

sportsman and involving fair,
honest rivalry, courteous relations
and graceful acceptance of
results.”

Why am I looking back into the
ol’ dictionary to ﬁnd out what
sportsmanship is? Well, after
witnessing the hockey game
between Pitt and Duquesne at
the Civic Arena on Friday, I felt I
needed a refresher course.

Itwas a good thing the Penguins
didn’t play St. Louis until 7:30
Saturday night, because it
probably took the grounds crew
at the arena all night to wash all
of the mud from the Pitt-
Duquesne game off the ice. I
mean the game was the dirtiest
that I’ve ever witnessed.

Where should I begin? Well,
let’s start with the mentality of a
few of the members of the

Duquesne team ——- mainly the
goaltender. During the course of
the game, whenever any of Pitt’s
players? would skate near the goal,
he would butt their skates with
his stick. At one point, one of
Pitt’s forwards ventured too close
to the Duquesne goal to get the
puck and foundhimself reamed
in the back of the head with the
butt of the goaltender’s stick.
When the officials blew the
whistle to call the penalty,
Duquesne’s goaltender yelled,
“He was asking for itl”

Of course he was asking for it
— and I was askingto see a game
with a sense of integrity, but

game.

In the pastl have alwayslooked
forward to Pitt-Duquesne hockey
games because of the long-
standing cross—town rivalry and
the fact that both teams normally
play extremely well, but looking
in hindsight at this game, it was a
joke.

Both teams played below their
normal standards, and Pitt began
to play with the same
inconsistency that Duquesne was
displaying. I attribute this fact to
both teams’ playing to the level
of the officiating. In a way, I have
to look at the officiating of the
game as one of the points of fault.

The referees started out calling
the game rather loosely and began
to call it tighter as the second
period approached. Around
midway through the second

period, the referees started calling
it looser again, and at the end of
the game they once again started
calling it tighter. It was as if the
refs didn’t know what they were
doing. Normally I’d expect a
degree of consistency in the
officiating at the collegiate level,
but in this game it would have
been like asking Barry Bonds to
consider himself the second—best
baseball player in the league.

During the game I happened
to glance into the stands and see
Jaromir Jagr watching the game.
I wonder what he must have
been thinking as he witnessed
the travesty of sportsmanship that
was unfolding on the ice. He
didn’t stay too long. I had noticed
that he left about five minutes
after he had arrived. Jagr, of
college age himself, probably
found the style of play executed
on the ice to be primitive.

In this Olympic year, we expect
each of our athletes to say, “In the
name of all competitors, I promise
that we shall take part in these
Olympic Games, respecting and
abiding by the rules which govern
them, in the true spirit of
sportsmanship for the glory of
the sport and the honor of our
teams.” Yet we can’t even hold to
these simple and true virtues in a
collegiate hockey game. After all,
collegiate athletics are supposed
to be the epitome of amateur
athletes. We can’t even expect a

‘cross—town rivalry to exhibit

anything more than a gang war.

Steelers

Continued ﬁ-om page 8
Now that the lists of unprotected players are out, let us get into

specific players.

Throwing another quality player into the seemingly open
quarterback position might help. How about bringing in Jim.
McMahon instead of giving Bubby Brister the $2 million he
thinks he deserves? McMahon may be a physical mess, but he
wins. He sure has done more in his career than the Bubster. Still,
he was never cursed with two years under Walton’s misguidance.

Veteran Seattle QB Dave Kreig is the best of the rest of the
quarterbacks. I know; the Pittsburgh organization has enough
mediocrity. Still, he can find ways to make the big plays that win
games and the big mistakes that lose them as well as Brister does.

The most worrisome position for the Steelers is probably
offensive line, especially guard. Sean Farrel of Denver is still a
solid player. So are two available Eagles, Ron Salt and Bruce
Collie, and Bruce Reimers of the Bengals. Joe Jacoby is the best

, tackle available, but it would probably take a huge offer toget

him to leave the champion Redskins. Dean Steinkuler has had
injury problems but is a quality player. He and Ron Mattes might
be in a more reasonable range than Jacoby.

There is even help available at receiver. My tireless campaign
for the Steelers to take Desmond Howard or Carl Pickens if at
all possible continues, but picking up a free agent like aging Roy
Green or Oiler burner Tony Jones couldn’t hurt.

One thing that didn’t hurt was the choice of Bill Cowher as
Chuck Noll’s replacement. He may not have been the best coach
available, but his hard—nosed, intense approach to the game is
definitely a perfect fit for the organization. After seeing him
interviewed on television, I’d say he is well versed in the art of
talking a lot without saying too much —— a necessity for an NFL
coach. Hey, maybe I should go into coaching. I’m always being
told I talk a lot without saying anything.

If his defense in Kansas City was any example, at least the
Pittsburgh defense will start to feature its outside linebackers,
Pro-Bowler Greg Lloyd and Jerrol Williams. Ideas of changing
to a 4-5 defense probably are out the window since Cowher and
new defensive coordinator Dom Campen (most recently the

Saints’ secondary coach) both came from systems that use the .

3-4.
Ifyou will excuse me (or ifyou won’t), I have to start checking
into that coaching career.

facilitators attend.

The group said its first meeting
was a great success.

“Hopefully everything this new
committee has set up to do will

’ get accomplished. By having a

diverse committee, everyone’s
perspective will be seen and
given,” said Marsha Thomas, the
community Outreach chair for
BAS.

“I think a lot Of good ideas
were generated, and I think these
people can make their ideas real
because they have enough
interest,” said Ross Pasquale, one
of the SGB members organizing

the committee.

SGB memberjacob Brody said
closed—mindedness “will not be
tolerated on this campus. Society
is changing and we must change
with it. It is the moral responsibility
of every human being to respect
each Other.”

All students are encouraged to
attend the meetings and to submit

ideas to “get more Of a student I

focus," said Brody, who also
sponsored the committee.

The need for diversity is
essential because “Pittsburgh is
such a diverse city. It's important
for students to be a part and
contribute to this diversity,” said
Pitt student Tracy Fulton.
