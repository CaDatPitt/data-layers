weapon on PAT bus pdssengers

V-=:w;‘¢.

An individual toting a semi-automat-
ic weapon decided to my his luck against
the Pitt police early Sunday morning.

The individual, later identified as 19-
year—old Brent Hucks, has been charged
by Pitt Police with reckless endanger-
ment, various violations of the PA
ﬁrearms code, and resisting arrest.

“He’s likely to face additional
charges once PAT and the sherriff’s
department ﬁnish their investigations,”
said Pitt Police Chief Rick Boyd.

At 12:55 a.m. Sunday morning, an
all points bulletin was put out by the
Allegheny County Sheriff ’s Department
for an individual who had j reportedly
threatened passengers at gunpoint while
riding a Port Authority Transit- bus
inbound to Oakland.

Nearly a half hour later, Pitt Police
ofﬁcers Randi Lamb and John Sicilia
were walking their night beat near the

comer of Forbes and South Bouquet '

Street when they observed Hucks, who
ﬁt the APB description.
Hucks, according to the Pitt Police

report, then approached the officers with ,

his hands in his jacket pockets and asked

when he could catch the next bus.

Noticing alcohol on Huck’s breath
and his slurred speech, the ofﬁcers asked
him to remove his hands from his coat
pockets as Pitt Police Sergeant James
Chester arrived as backup for the duo.

Hucks, according to the report, then
drew a loaded Jennings 380 semi-auto-
matic pistol from his jacket and bran-
dished the weapon at the officers.

The three police officers immediate-
ly restrained Hucks and proceeded to
force him to the ground, where they were
able to ‘subdue and arrest him.

“'Ihe officers would have been well
within their authority to ﬁre on the indi-
vidual as he drew his weapon at them,”
said Boyd. ,“But with great risk to them-
selves, they took down and subdued him
without any shots being fired.”

The officers were unshaken and
were able to return to duty immediately
after deputies came to haul Hucks off to
Allegheny County Jail.

“This was a heck of an act for an
officer,” said Boyd.

Neither the officers nor Hucks was

available for comment about the inci-
dent. ‘

PONTIAC, Mich. — The “Jenny Jones
Show” murder trial is ﬁnally over, with the
defendant, Jonathon Schmitz, found guilty
of second degree murder. Schrnitz was
charged with killing his former roommate
three days after the taping of a “Jenny Jones”
episode in which his former male roommate
admitted to having a crush on him. The
defense tried to blame the murder on the

“Jenny Jones Show,” but the jury found the

defendant guilty despite this. Associated

FORT LEONARD WOOD, Mo —— A
male drill sergeant at one of the biggest
basic—tiaining posts in the country pleaded
guilty Tuesday to having sex with three
female soldiers. Staff Sgt. Loren B. Taylor
also admitted to trying to have sex with a
fourth and having improper contact with a
ﬁfth. Army regulations ban sexual relation-
ships between subordinates and corr1man-
ders.

Taylor allegedly offered one of the
female witnesses $500 for changing her tes-
timony, but as part of his plea. the Army
dropped the charges of perjury and obstruc-
tion of justice. This is the second Army sex
scandal in less than a week. Associated Press

Graduate students’ unions
sweep colleges across U. 5.

“Anthony Breznican

 

The movement to unionize graduate
students is not just catching on at Pitt, but
has recently swept colleges and universi-
ties across the country.

There are already unions at the
University of Michigan, University of
Massachusetts, and the University of
Florida.

Just last year the University of Iowa
won a representational election, and grad
students at the University of Califomia
are preparing to strike next week if their
administrators don’t sit down at the bar-
gaining table with them. »

“What we’re involved in here is not
just a local thing, it’s really a national
movement,” said Pitt COGS member
M a r g u e r i t e
Brown. “For a
long time there
wasn’t much
activity in grad-
uate employee .
organizing, but in the last few years it’s
really picked up and there are some very
dynamic things happening.”

She said she hopes Pitt’s grad stu-
dents can share in that movement, but as
the campaign at the University of
California proves, the road to unioniza-
tion is a long and rocky one.

“We’ve been starting a graduate
union here for well over 10 years,” said
Dan Johnston, spokesperson for the
Association of Student Employees at the
University of California at San Diego. “It
began at Berkeley in 1984, and we start-
ed in San Diego in l989.”

He said the union is currently strug-
gling for recognition by the adrninistra—
tion, so next week all of UC’s campuses
will unite in a strike against the
University.

“They deny we’re employees under
state law,” Johnston said. “We’ve gone
through court procedures and it’s been

decided under California law that we are
4 students not employees.” ~

Johnston said UCLA grad students
will strike Monday to change that. If the
University does not recognize them by 5
p.m., grad students at UC in San Diego
will also. strike. Ief administrators still
refuse to recognize them by Wednesday,
then grad students will strike at Berkeley,
and the following day at Santa Cruz.

But keeping in mind. that their
actions will also affect many innocent
undergraduates and faculty members, the

. grad students at UC said they will only

hold the strike for that week.
“We don’t want to totally disrupt
classes just yet,” Johnston said.

“Hopefully the administrators will see
things from our point of View and sit
down at the bargaining table with us.”

GRADUATE STUDENT

UNION?
Part 4 of 4

 

This problem of recognition is often
the first thing a graduate student union
runs into at the beginning of a campaign.
Because graduate student employees are
also students, many states refuse to rec-
ognize them as workers.

COGS spokesperson Barbara White,
of the English department, said Pitt grad-
uate students have been recognized _as
employees in previous court proceedings,
but their status in the University is still
uncertain.

“Just because the court or the state
calls you a worker or an employee does
not necessarily mean the University is
going to uphold that,” she said. “[Our
campaign] is investigating that issue, 
but we’re still a long way from that
stage.”

But the University of Kansas, the
problem ‘ of
recognition was
quickly solved
by ‘assistance
from the state.

“There was a
whole series of court proceedings and the
state investigated the problem,” said
David Young, a spokesperson for the
University of Kansas’ graduate union.
“They said it was very clear that the rea-
son they employed graduate assistants
was because it’s the cheapest way to get
the job done.”

After that, Young said the unioniza-
tion process was quick, and very prosper-
ous for the students ﬁghting to get a
tuition stipend. ’

“As soon as we organized, the
administrators offered full tuition for all
TA’s,” he said. “It reﬂected the organiza-
tion’s efforts and was an attempt, I think,
to appease us, and satisfy us so we
wouldn’t do anything more.”

Tuition stipends are the goals of
many other grad student unions across
the country. At the University of Iowa,
union spokesperson Leslie Taylor said
the main goal is better health coverage,
because the pay is so low students can’t
afford the insurance offered by the
University.

“We have to pay full tuition [nearly
$3,500], and when you’re only making

$12,500 dollars a year, the $800 it costs to T’

by their health plan is a bit much,” Taylor
said, adding that a union is the only way
to achieve tuition stipends. A

Unionizers at Pitt, like many of these
other universities, are also pulling for full
funding for all grad students, better health
care, and a stronger grievance procedure.

4 If what Taylor says is true, the union
may be the only way to guarantee these
needs will be satisﬁed.

“[Administrators] can offer us any-
thing but if it’s not in a negotiated con-
tract, there’s no guarantee they can’t take
it away again,” she said.

O’Shaughnessy said. “If [the deal] were to
go through, it would be a win—win-win sit-
uation for the community, the fraternity,
and the University.”

Nothing has yet been ﬁnalized.
Everything is still being negotiated, and the
members of the fraternity who live in the
house say that no timetable has been pre-
sented to them.

“This may go on for months, or even

FROM PAGE 1 

A years,” said fraternity President John Italia.

As for their relations with the commu-
nity, the nine members living in the house
say that they have had no complaints from
their neighbors recently. The only com-
plaints came after remodeling the house,

 

according to members.

“We put a lot of work into this house.
There was a ﬁre in 1989 or 90  we all
ﬁxed it,” said member Todd Feddock.

According to the members there was
an accumulation of things being thrown
out in their garage because of the renova-
tion. One member, Mike Kovaleski, said
that a neighbor told him Psi Omega had
better clean out the garage. The only other
complaint came from a group called the
Belleﬁeld Association through Whitehead.
They wanted the members to stop parking
cars on the front lawn. Psi Omega did.

The Belleﬁeld Association could not
be reached for comment.

“Since then, we’ve had no problems,”
Kovaleski said. “They haven’t mentioned
anything and that was about two years
ago.” i

The other members agreed, saying

they have had very little contact with the
neighbors. -

“We don’t want to judge [any neigh-
bors] either,” Feddock said. “But on Friday
and Saturday nights a lot of undergraduates
are walking back and forth from the bars
along this street.”

The members say not even cigarettes
are allowed in the house and that they keep
to themselves most of the time.

“They just assume that and associate
us with other fraternities,” said member 1

Brian Dorfman.

As for the big tooth, the members say
that it has been there as long as the house,
and will stay unless some sort of deal is
worked out between Crossgates, Pitt, and
the Psi Omega housing authority. .

“The tooth is a sign of our profession-
alism,” said fraternity Vice President
Robert Baker. .

questions are brought up. One writer
revealed her uncontrollable desire for sex.
She asked if everyone was run by their
sexuality.

“What separates us from animals or
men?” she wrote. ~

Someone else responded asking the

writers if they had anything better to do.

Ironic. After all, why did she even
bother writing something if she had better
things to do?

Professor Harry Fowler, a Pitt behav-
ioral psychologist, said he didn’t know
why people wrote grafﬁti.

He suggested talking to someone
who dealt with delinquent behavior. P

But over the years graffiti has
become more than just delinquent behav-
ior. There are those who find beauty and
function in the writings.

“It’s not vandalism. It’s a way of lan-
guage, a way of communicating outward
but in a secretive way,” said Christian
Baker, the leader of BiGaLa.

S. Baker and Dralmak are talking about
two different forms but the function of the
writings have a common bond. Draimak
said a “piece” — an elaborate mural or
writing, often takes many hours. Some
pieces are sketched and plarmed out by
artists even before it is put up on a wall.

The writings on the bathroom wall
aren’t necessarily plarmed out, but they
address the issues that are concerning the
youth of today. Issues like sexuality,
gangs, and religion can be seen on many
surfaces around the country.

Grafﬁti, often thought to be acts of
vandalism by the uneducated and angry,
are changing the culture. But like its
“characters” (inanimate ﬁgures personi-
ﬁed), this subculture has taken on new
life.

Today many writers are commis-
sioned to create murals that cover entire
buildings, sending a message that what
started out as a rant of rebellion is now a
voice of the silent. ‘

Marquette Bowman said students
need to promote a more enthusiastic
attitude on campus. One way he plans
to do this is by working with the Pitt
Program Council to bring more exciting
programs on campus.

Bowman said, “The programming
they set up is kind of monotonous. It’s
the same year after year.”

David Eisenberg thinks Pitt should
utilize its standing in the community to
better campus life. He expressed sup-
port for student gathering spots such as
the proposed cyber—pub on Bouquet
Street. ~

“I think it’s important for Pitt to
further its partnership with the commu-
nity,” Eisenberg said.

Pitt’s low ranking in a recent U.S.
News and World Report had board can-
didate David Teeters upset.

While he said there are many posi-
tive things about Pitt, some things need
to be changed. He emphasized that Pitt
needs to update the class registration
process to include phone registration, or
possibly intemet registration.

“Pitt needs to pay attention to the
implementation of and integration of
computer technology,” Teeters said.

Student and administration apathy
was also a concern for many of the stu-
dents present. They asked board candi-
dates Christa Douaihy and Lisa Caplan
what they plarmed to do about the lack
of enthusiasm on campus.

Douaihy said the problem with the
administration is a communication bar-
rier.

“We need to push for organization
to agitate the administration, so they
stop suffocating us and start listening to
us,” Douaihy said.

Caplan agreed, saying there was a
communication problem with students,
and thatthey are generally uninformed
about issues facing them.

“We need to get up, get out there.
Be in student’s faces.'Tell them why it’s
important, not just that it’s an issue,”
Caplan said. '

But campus concerns weren’t the
only issues the panel grappled with last

evening.

Proposition 209, the California leg-
islation that would ban affirmative
action and end funding to many minor-
ity groups, was also discussed. This leg-
islation would affect funding for certain
student groups such as the BAS and
CWO.

Many candidates agreed that

Proposition 209 would affect Pitt stu-
dents and that SGB needed to get
involved.
P But the final question of the
evening was whether the SGB should
be involved in external issues such as
Proposition 209 or if they should con-
centrate on issues immediately con-
cerning Pitt.

All of the candidates agreed that
both internal and external issues were
the concern of the SGB.

Board candidate Jen Molluso said
both external and internal issues affect '
our students and that Pitt is “a micro-
cosm of the world.”

Ryan Riehle agreed saying, “It is
illogical to think that anything that hap-
pens outside the University would not
affect what happens inside the

 Writer reviews experience

with black. unification

,'<!_.' °'.S'

Derrick Bell read about the African-

American experience from his new book,
“Gospel Choir,” to a mesmerized audience.
He paused between chapters to allow the
gospel choir present to sing the message of
each chapter.

“He has ‘been a great role model for me
for many years,” Judge Justin Johnson of the
Superior Court of Pennsylvania said.
“Someday I hope to have the same integrity,
strength, and ability which he has.”

Johnson, who brought his spouse and
son, went on ﬂie say, “This is my son in
whom I am well pleased. We should all be
pleased in the message in which Bell brings
to us.”

The reading, which was held in the
courtroom of the law school building, was
packed with all sorts of people from all
walks of life. The multi-racial crowd includ-
ed men and women, young and old, and stu-
dents and professors, to name a few.

Bell talked about the power of uniﬁca-

I tion through non-violent demonstration

amongst blacks. He used an analogy of
black women all across America stopping
traﬂic because they all decided to dance the
electric slide on the streets. In the process,
they prevented millions of commuters from
getting to work.

‘ Sound bizarre?

g Maybe not as odd as his second analo-
gy of the space traders who buy all the
Af1ican—A1nericans from the whites in
exchange for gold and clean air. After the
blacks leave in the space ship, America’s
problems continue to grow due to unevenly
distributed income.

There were giggles and outbursts of
laughters as he told his stories with witty lit-

‘ tle comments, but he made his point.

“White America wishes that black
America will just go away so it can return to
its Norman Rockwell [look]. America,
whether white America likes it or not, is our
home, too,” said Bell. “How do you get
white folks to understandthat they are losing
jobs not because of affirmative action? The
causes of joblessness are technological
advances that enrich a few.”

Bell, who is oftentimes credited as one
of the pioneers of critical race law, a type of
law that brings personal experience, anec-
dotes, and rﬁctional stories into the law
process, believes that the law is too distant
from the people.

  

“Everyone thinks the laws control the
society, but the society controls the law,” said
Bell.

“My writing provides readers with a
broader view [of race] as opposed to that
which the media focuses on — black

crime,” said Bell. “And because of this, soci— ‘

ety has learned to look at race in a skewed
way. We [society] focus, on the transgression
of the few instead of the monumental injus-
tices corrnnitted to the whole.”

Bell, a 1957 graduate of the Pitt Law
School, is a visiting professor at the New
York University Law School and is the
author of several other race relations books.

‘“Gospel Choir’ is not about gospel
music, but it gets its inspiration from gospel
music,” said Bell. “I use gospel music
because I want people to hear and under-
stand me even without reading my boo .”

Peter Shane, dean of the law school,
praised Bell, saying, “Sweeter sounds have
never been heard in this room,” after the
Sounds of Joy choir had sung its last chapter.

‘This is a special occasion,” said Shane.
“[Bell] is a personal hero of mine and a dis-
tinguished lecturer; it means a great deal to
our students and faculty that someone with
inﬂuential ties would return to his hometown
and schoo  .

But Bell does not escape without con-
troversy. He ﬁnds opposing responses and
controversies about his books grave misin-
terpretations.

“My books don’t come down hard on

white people,” Bell said. ‘There are some
whites that are just as worse off as blacks.”

A second—year law student, Chip
Paternoster, thought Bell was “fantastic.”

“Both the law school and the University
will do well to invite more people like
Derrick Be ,” said Paternoster.

The president of the Black Law Student
Association, Rich Harrison, presented to
Bell on behalf of the organization a Djembe
drum as a symbol of his passion.

“We thank you for paving the way for
us,” said Harrison as he handed Bell the
Nigerian drum.

Bell became Harvard Law School’s ﬁrst
black tenured law professor. After 18 years,
he was kicked—off for not ending a two—year
protest leave because the school failed to hire
any tenure minority women. He was dean at

_ the University of Oregon Law School and

resigned because of similar situations. He
continues to spread his message of equality
to anyone who is willing to read his works or
listen to gospel music.

Even though we hate if,
we're only human too

In Monday’s edition, 21 story ﬁddled with errors ran on
page three. The story, titled “Fraternity moves due to neighbors’
complaints,” was almost completely wrong due to mistakes
made by both The Pitt News staff and by sources used in
researching the article.

Today, a new version of the story that is more fully
researched and written. to include more speciﬁcs can be found
on page one. .

Naturally, we at The Pitt News were upset to hear about
these errors and embarrassed about any problems the members
of Psi Omega, a graduate dental fraternity, or the dental school
itself had with the original article. We felt it necessary in this
instance to do more than just run a correction or fix the errors
in the first story.

We also felt it necessary to explain our position in this
turn of events. The Pitt News staff does its best to sift through
rumors and rhetoric and to print the facts. The only way any-
thing about this University is going to get better is for the stu-
dents, faculty, and staff to remain informed. Providing this
information is our job, and we take that job very seriously.

At the same time, we are a student newspaper. It is not
only our job ﬁnd the truth, but also to train reporters and editors,
giving them valuable experience that will be useful later in their
careers while we do it. Juggling writing, editing, training, and
tackling a full-time courseload is a hefty task. Sometimes,
though we hate it when this happens, we do drop the ball. (Of
course, if you ask our professors, when it comes to class, we
usually drop the ball.)

But we are always more than happy to hear concerns
from our readers, especially if there have been any factual inac-
curacies in our work.

Please feel free to contact the paper with any concerns
you have by phone, e—mail, campus mail, or stopping by 434

It doesn’t matter
why you do it, just
get out and vote, it’s
your right

In the Nov. 4 edition of
The Pitt News, I read a rather
disturbing column entitled
“Half-assed voting hurts the
nation.” On the eve of the
election, the author urged
everyone who has not been
“reading newspapers regular-
ly at least since the pri-
maries” not to vote. He
implied that non-voters are
the only citizens who have
the right to complain about
politics, saying, “If you vote,
and you elect corrupt, dis-
honest politicians, then
you’re responsible, and you
have no right to complain.”
He ended his column with the
plea, “Please leave the deci-
sion—making to those who
know what’s going on.”

The elitist views of the
author are not what our
nation was built upon and I
can only hope that few peo-
ple were affected by his
twisted logic. My argument
comes too late to have an
impact on the 1996 elections,

but I hope people will listen
to what I have to say anyway.
As Americans, we have an
obligation to vote. The abili-
ty to elect our own represen-
tatives is what distinguishes
us from other countries.
People have died fighting for
this right.

Even if we haven’t been
reading the newspapers for
the last four years, we should
vote. People do not live in a
vacuum. We don’t need a
newspaper to tell us if things
are going well. Sure, it’s nice
to know every detail about
every candidate, but if you
haven’t had \time to read the
newspaper every day since
the primaries started, but you
have watched a “debate or
two” and seen a “few propa-
ganda—based television com-
mercials,” get out there and
vote. Even if you don’t know
anything about the candi-
dates, butknow that you gen-
erally side with the
Republican Party or the
Democrats, get out there and
vote. Even if you have to
resort to asking someone
whose opinion you respect
about the candidates, get out
there and vote.

The nice thing about
America, the thing that the
author of Monday’s column
doesn’t seem to understand,
is that you don’t have to
“take some classes in eco-
nomics, political science, and
especially history” to be able
to vote. America is not about
the educated people ruling
over the uneducated. Every
single American citizen over
the age of 18 has the ability

to make his or her voice
heard and to impact the way
our society is run.

I happen to know that the
author of Monday’s column
is a white male. Perhaps, he
takes his right to vote for
granted because he has
always had it. Others of us -
women, African—Americans,
and Asians — know that
there was a time in our
American history when we
were forbidden this exercise
of democracy.

Women were led through
a “century of struggle” by

activists like Susan B.
Anthony, Frederick
Douglass, Lucretia Mott,

Elizabeth Cady Stanton,
Antoinette Brown Blackwell,
and others, all of whom
fought endlessly for our right
to vote but few of whom
lived to cast their ballots.
African—Americans endured a
similar struggle, as did many
immigrants and Asians, who
were restricted from voting
by such measures as a poll
tax, residency requirements,
and literacy exams. Many
people fought long, uphill
battles so that every single
adult American citizen could
make their voices heard. If
not for any other reason, we
should go to the ballot boxes
and cast our votes in their
honor as a measure of respect
for what they accomplished.

I urge every reader of The
Pitt News to disregard
Monday’s column and take an
active part in shaping our
country.

The ISO has
nothing to do with I
the Socialist Party,

don’t ya know?

I’m writing in response to
the story “Major parties are no-
shows at socialist debate.”
While the ISO is glad to get the
coverage, I would like to point
out a mistaken assumption in
the article. It says “By the con-
clusion of the debate, many
problems had been discussed,
but the Socialist solution, Cal
Hollis, the Socialist Party’s
write-in presidential candidate,
was not mentioned at all.”

The International Socialist
Organization, which hosted the
debate, is in no way affiliated
with the Socialist Party or the
Socialist Equality Party, nor did
we endorse Mary Cal Hollis or
any other candidate. If we were
to have mentioned her candida-
cy, it would have been to argue
that it does no represent a solu-
tion. We maintain that the solu-
tion lies "outside of electoral pol-
itics, as we said at the debate, in
“strikes, demonstrations, and
struggles that come from the
bottom.”

The face of politics
througout the
world, socialism
versus capitalism J

The following is a letter in
response to Miguel Llinas’ col-
umn on 10/22/96:

Miguel Llinas is somewhat
disingenuous in his column on
capitalism and fascism. He
attacks capitalism as it exists in
the real world, but refuses to
“attempt to prove the ‘practicali-
ty’ of socialism.” ’

If you understand the theory
of “capitalism” (neoclassical
economics),‘you lmow that wage
disparity is based on talent (pro-
ductivity), and competition oth-
erwise keeps wages equal across
and within companies. Yeah, that
doesn’t work in reality. But as a a
practical matter, socialism has
been at best a mixed bag.
Communism has never been -
applied in the real world in a
form approaching its theory
(except maybe Kibbutzim) so it
makes a poor benchmark totest
capitalism against. And what
exactly is the ditference between

' socialism as applied in Europe

and capitalism, or with our own
govemment entitlements?

In the U.S., the brainwashing
of the Cold War insures that in
this generation there will be no
effective socialism or socialist
criticism. Raising the specter of
socialism marginalizes the
important questions Mr. Llinas
did raise.

Racism and nationalism
exist in non-capitalist countries.
Maybe Marxist theory ‘ can
explain away these “aberra-
tions,” but most of us don’t live
in a theoretical world. Radicals in
the ‘60s in the U.S. who tried to
organize along Marxist or anar-
chist theory were
perceived as ide-
ologically rigid
and occasionally
sexist. A steel-

night a truth dawned on me: for
better or worse, he was right.

So I thought, it’s my fault any-
way, right? If I’d quit shooting for
shallow girls, none of this would
happen. So I should just shoot for
the piototypic nice, pretty but not
overwhelmingly beautiful,
Christian girl and I’m set, right?
Nada This is where the real prob-
lem begins. You see, there’s a thing
that my friend Kevin and I call the
“intangible theory” simply because
it has no riﬂes. In other words -
and I’m being very general here —
just because you’re the perfect
match for a girl does not mean
you’ll get her. Why? Because

You contemplate the priesthood

So this past surrirner, while I
was home again like New Edition,
wondering why girls be  these
Bone Thugs-type dudes, my
cousin “Punchie” said something

back on track. He said, “Jason,
what you don’t seem to understand
is this: because you love and
believe in God, you need to know
that He has your wife, your job,
your children, etc. somewhere
right now and He’ll givethem to
you just like He’s given you every-
thing else you’ve ever needed -
when He’s ready.”

Understand that this friend and I —
despite our longtime friendship —
are not similar at all. He always had
the right clothes, the right thing to
say to the ladies, always knew the
right people, and so on and so

Anyway, we were locked
deep in a conversation about girls
when he suddenly said, “Jason,
what you don’t seem to understand

because I represent thrills. You rep-

you’re persistent. The thing I’m

talking about is not charisma, it’s
bigger than that. That’s why we
call it intangible. Because we don’t
know what it is but we -are very
aware of it when we don’t have it.
Sound stupid? Then explain
the array of girls that I met sopho-
more year — all people that, theo-
retically, I should hook up with —
people who said to me the popular
refrain (everybody now), “It’s not a
reﬂection on you, Jason. I just

’don’t feel the same way that you

feel.” The first few times you hear
that, it doesn’t affect you. You write
it off as coincidence. But after you
keep hearing it, you start to think,
“It’s gotta be me if I keep hearing
the same thing from everyone.”
Then your self-esteem drops
like rain. You start to look in the
mirror and ﬁnd things wrong with
that idiot on the other side. You’re
too skinny. You’re too short You
just look goofy. I mean, really, you
starttothink,ifanyotherguy
would do these romantic,
Babyface-esque things that I am
doing, girls would be eating out of
his hand. I must be some kinda
degenerate. You start to question
publicly if you’ll ever get married.

in bigger terms now. All I try to
deal with is what I can control,
which is Jason. Like everyone else,
I have my good points and bad
points, but now I’m working to
weave myself into a tapestry that is
fully operational in mind, soul, and
body. Then, on that momentous
day when God sees ﬁt to send me
someone who’ll love me, I’ll reach
out to her and love her and adore
her. Because I was ﬁrst able to‘do
that to myself.

The rules need to
be reevaluated it
love is just a game,
times have changed

As a member of the Pitt
women’s cross country team, I was
very disappointed when I opened
The Pitt News on Tuesday, Nov. 5,
to read in bold letters above a pic-
ture of one of my teammates,
“Runners’ high grounded at Big
East meet.”

What?! We competed in the

~ toughest conference in the nation

and came out eighth — one place
up from last year’s ninth place ﬁn-

9

ish. Not to mention that the men’s
race was the most competitive in
years! The .1996 Pitt men’s and
women’s cross country teams’ per-
formance at the Big East champi-
onship was one of the best in Pitt
history! And our “runners’ high”
was supposedly grounded?!
Between the men’s and women’s
teams, I believe nine runners had
their personal best times. That
hardly shows a lack of enthusiasm.

Maybe before the copy desk*
decides on a headline, they ought
to get the facts straight! The article
itself didn’t indicate that the cross
country teams had a sub-par per-
formance at the meet. The
women’s team was less than 10
points away from being sixth,
which would’ve put us in front of
Connecticut and West Virginia,
two teams which, in the past, have
ﬁnished signiﬁcantly ahead of Pitt
in cross country.

I certainly hope that in the
future The Pitt News will be a little
more careful in choosing words for

— headlines. I am proud to be a mem-

ber of the Pitt cross country team,
and, as a senior, I am proud to
know that my last Big East cham-
pionship was all it could be. And I
believe I can speak_for the rest of
the team as well.

Stephanie Ellsworth _

English Writing, 1997

*editors note: The people who are
responsible for the headlines in a
section are the editors of that sec-
tion, not the copy desk

We had the time of
our lives, how
could you have
said otherwise?

Sexual attitudes
changed since the ‘50s, as Paul
Stein notes. He refers to a
“game” — but by whose rules?
We have been struggling
through an era of considerable
difficulty with relationships —
with divorce rates brimming
over 50 percent, broken fami-
lies, and unloved children.
Certainly, the rules have
changed; they are more relaxed
now, but I hardly think that with
the recent miserable track record
in relationships that we ought to
be thinking of sex as merely fun
and games. We, must balance
impetuous passions with deeper,
more permanent compassion.
The rule books are currently
being re-written, let us hope we
have the sense to rewrite them
well, and leave a better legacy
than we are inheriting.

When Pitt travels to South

Bend Saturday to battle the

Ex-Big Easties
blow up NBA

 

The Big East Conference is con-
sidered one of the most powerful in
the world of intercollegiate athletics.
Granted, the conference bodes the
likes of Temple’ and Rutgers, but
year-in and year-out this conglomer-
ation produces squads that make
major bowl games and every March
they represent in the NCAA
Tournament.

Last year was one of the best for
men’s basketball in the Big East.
Georgetown had a trio of stars in
Jerome Williams, Othello
Harrington, and my all-time second-
favorite acquitted "convict, Allen
Iverson. .

John Wallace carried the
Cinderella Orangemen to the final
and almost pulled off a Goliath—like
effort against Kentucky.

Ray Allen was the posterboy for
charm and grace on the court for the
UConn Huskies. Next to Rebecca
Lobo, Allen was the biggest thing to
hit Connecticut since Bob Newhart.

When the NBA Draft rolled

around last April in the
Meadowlands, many of the Big East
studs were stylin’ in their

olive/teal/burgundy suits that some-
how they bought before they even
knew what team would be paying
them obscene amounts of money.
(That’s another story in itself, so I’ll
leave that alone for now.)

On that night only the
Southeastern Conference had more
players drafted, 13, than the Big
East. The question many hoop ana—
lysts had was: Could these players,
despite their above average talents
in college, come into the NBA and
make an impact?

That question has been
answered. A few of these players
have already begun to make a name
for themselves at the next level.

- COLUMN, PAGE 20 mm

 

Fighting Irish of Notre Dame, it
basically has nothing to lose and

everything to gain.

The Panthers are winding down
a disappointing season that’s start-
ing to end on a positive note. They
are gaining some valuable experi-
ence for some of their younger

players.

Freshman Brian

Minehart
thinks the Notre Dame game will
be a valuable experience builder.
“Playing a team like Notre
Dame is a once in a lifetime oppor-

tunity,” Minehart said. “I’m not

saying we’re going to win, but it’s
possible. Playing out there in front
of a huge crowd will really help
the freshmen in the future. I was
nervous at first in the-Ohio State
game, but now I’m not even ner-

vous. We’re getting stronger and
‘ faster, and we know the system a

lot better now.”

Pitt comes off a bye-week and
will have had 16 days to prepare
for the game. Following a devilish-
ly nice 20-13 Halloween victory
the
Panthers will attempt to keep it
going against 15th—ranked Notre

against Boston College,

Dame. Pitt hasn’t defeated a
ranked opponent on the road since
they beat Texas A&M 31-28 in the
1989 John Hancock Bowl.

The two teams last collided in
1993 when Pitt gave the Irish a
fight, at least in the first half. The
Fighting Irish led only 13-0 at the
half but then pulled away to a 44-0
victory in the second half at Notre
Dame Stadium.

As a 37-point underdog, every-
one expects the game to be over in
the first quarter, but the Panthers
believe they can be competitive.

“You have to go up there with

Junior John Jenkins (15) says Touchdown Jesus won’t bother
him— he’s just worried about the freshmen.

 

the right mind—state.” said redshirt
junior John Jenkins. “You can’t go
up there and see Touchdown Jesus
and get petrified. We’re starting a
lot of young guys, especially on
defense. As long as we focus on
what we got to do we’ll ‘be
alright.”

Notre Dame’s record thus far is
6-2. Pitt is 3-6 (2-4 in the Big
East).

In a press conference, Notre
Dame Head Coach Lou Holtz said
he wasn’t taking Pitt for granted

 

Powlus leads NotreDam, not Pitt

ike Kovak

 

Sometimes, it’s funny to see
how things turn out.

Less than four years ago, Ron
Powlus couldn’t decide if he want-
ed to go to Pitt or Notre Dame. Pitt
had just hired Johnny Majors and
Powlus’ girlfriend attended the ﬁne
establishment.

“Regardless of what others [the
media] have saidiover the years,”
said Fighting Irish Head Coach Lou
Holtz, “I’m pleased that Ron
Powlus has been part of the Notre
Dame program the last four years.”

Not everybody agrees with
Holtz.

Powlus was dubbed as a can’t-

rniss blue chipper. Television ana— .

lyst Brent Musberger predicted two
Heisman Trophies for “the
Pennsylvania native.

Powlus has disappointed those

 

experts and the ‘people at Pitt,
where some feel Powlus may have
produced better numbers.

However, he’s put up numbers
comparable to Notre Dame’s all-
time greats. He’s thrown more
touchdown passes (40) than Joe
Thiesmann, Steve Beuerlein, or Joe
Montana. His completion percent-
age (56 percent) also ranks among
the elite. _

In 1994, he set the Notre Dame
record for touchdown passes in a
single season —— 19, and he aver-
aged a school-record 170.6 passing
yards per game that year.

“It comes down to champi-
onships at this school,” Holtz said.
“He hasn’t won any and that’s why
people are hard on him.”

He won’t win any this year
either. His injury-plagued colle-
giate career will end at best with a
9-2 mark and no Heisman Trophy
consideration.

As I checked the point spreads for
this weekend’s matchups, one thing
struck me: Northwestern, who has yet to
impress the bookmakers and are consis-
tently made underdogs against lesser
competition, is ﬁnally getting respect.

Purdue travels to Evanston - this
Saturday, and Northwestern is ab whop-
ping ll-point favorite.

Although Northwestern is not going
back to the Rose Bowl, the fact that they
have sustained their success over two
seasons is truly amazing. In a confer-
ence long known as the “Big Two and
the ,Little Eight,” Northwestern has
always been the littlest. Unlike their Big
10 brethren, Northwestern must grapple
with high academic standards, poor
facilities, very little tradition, and a prac-
tically non-existent fan base.
(Northwestern must compete with Notre
Dame, Illinois, and the Chicago Bears.)

People have even argued that
Northwestern should secede from the
conference, but no one suggests any
drastic measures anymore, and probably
won’t for quite a few years, because suc-
cess breeds more success. Top recruits
that once may have laughed at
Northwestern now have the Wildcats on
their lists. In fact, a blue chip quarter-
back from Minneapolis, Gavin
Hoffman, has already committed to the
Wildcats, and others are sure to follow.

Michigan—slayer Purdue may be out
to win another for retiring Coach Jim
Colletto, but I like  Northwestern 28,
Purdue 17.

Pitt (3-6) at Notre Dame (6-2) —-
After the Ohio State disaster, who
would’ve thought that Pitt had an excel-
lent shot at a four-win season? Lytle and
the young Panthers have improved, and
are encouraged by Notre Dame’s loss to
Air Force, but still aren’t a match for an
Irish team that plays to its capabilities.
Notre Dame 37, Pitt 20.

Penn State (8-2) at Michigan (7-2)
— The Shittany Lions’ Wally
Richardson quieted his critics two
weeks ago with a strong performance
against Northwestern, but Michigan is
on the rebound after an embarrassing 9-
3 loss to Purdue. Michigan 24, Penn
State 14.

_ Ohio State (9-0) at Indiana (2-7)
— Kentucky is winning for ﬁred Coach
Bill Curry and Purdue is winning for
retiring (read: ﬁred) Coach Jim Colletto;
but the Hoosiers, whose coach, Bill
Mallory, is also gone at the end of the
year, are still getting pounded. Question:

upsets

If the Buckeyes lose to Michigan next
week, which would be the seventh loss
to the Wolverines in nine seasons, could
John Cooper be ﬁred despite having one
of the strongest programs in the coun-
try? Ohio State 51, Indiana 7.

Army (9-0) at Syracuse (6-2) —
Army has fattened its record against the
likes of North Texas, Yale, and
Lafayette, although they did handle Air
Force, which in turn handled Notre
Dame. Syracuse controls its own destiny
and will be playing in either the Orange
or Fiesta Bowl, as the Big East champ, if
it ﬁnishes with wins over Temple and
Miami, regardless of what it does
against Army. What it does against
 may not be pretty. Syracuse 45,

‘Amy 24.

Virginia Tech (7-1) at Miami (6-2)
— Miami, like Syracuse, has no losses
in the Big East and controls its own des-
tiny with regard to being selected to an
Alliance bowl. Prior reports in this space
of Miarni’s demise were greatly, exag-
gerated. Miami 23, Virginia Tech 14.

Louisville (5-5) at Houston (6-4)
— Pitt fans were embarrassed when the
Panthers lost to Houston, but the
Cougars are respectable at 6-4.
Louisville is on the Pitt Schedule in
1997, as is Houston. Houston 35,
Louisville 31. -

North Carolina (8-1) at Virginia

(6-3) — North Carolina was helped by .

Memphis’ upset of Tennessee, since it
now puts the Tarheels in line for a possi-
ble at-large bid to an Alliance bowl.

‘Virginia, with a defense almost as tough

as the ‘Heels, has other ideas. Upset
Special of the Week: Virginia 19,
North Carolina 17.

Illinois (2-7) at Minnesota (3-6) —_

In an unusual move, Minnesota told
Coach Jim Wacker that he would be
fired if he didn’t win at least ﬁve games.
Wacker was sitting pretty at 3-0, includ-
ing a huge upset of Syracuse. I’m no
math major, but I would assume, with a
3-6 record and two games remaining,
that Wacker can still make his ﬁve game

mandate. Nevertheless, Wacker resigned I

this week. Illinois’ Lou Tepper was also
ﬁred this week. Minnesota 29, Illinois
23.

Guest pick: Ralph Conde, host of
“SportsLine;” Kansas State (8-1) at
Colorado (8-1) — Ralph’s show, which
is billed as “A Westrnoreland County
Tradition,” airs on Saturday mornings at
8:30 on WHJB 620 AM, out of
Greensburg. ‘Ralph sees this game as an
even matchup and likes Colorado based
on home-ﬁeld advantage. Colorado 24,
Kansas State 17.

Overall record, 53-30 (64%); Last
week, 5-3 (63%); Upsets 7-11 (39%);
Guest Picks, 4-5 (44 %)

Two weeks ago, the Pitt hockey

team had a two—goal lead on
Allegheny and they dropped back into
a defensive mode; however, this past
weekend they pulled out all the stops.

After taking a 3-0 lead over
Edinboro in the first period, ’ they
went on a relentless scoring spree.
They crushed Edinboro 16-0 last
Saturday at Neville Ice Rink. The win
improves Pitt’s overall record to 4-1-
1.

Goaltender Patrick Kenny got the
shut—out for the Panthers and Bill
Elliott posted eight points with five
goals and three assists to lead Pitt.

“It was nice to finally get a game
where everything came together,”
Elliott said. _

Pitt opened the scoring early on in
the first period taking a 1-0 lead. Not
only did they quickly establish a scor-
ing game, their physical game was
evident as well.

Matt White took care of the phys-
ical play when he hit an Edinboro
player temporarily taking his oppo-
nent out of the play.

“I hit him clean,” White said.

Pitt quickly returned to the scor-
ing. With just 2:20 left in the first,
Elliott scored his first of the contest

Piﬂ hockey humiliates humbled Edinboro, 16-O

giving Pitt 21 2-0 lead. Fifty seconds
later, Pitt scored again making it 3-0.

The second period was the same
as the first, Pitt shooting and scoring
and Edinboro still trying for that first
goal of the game, which ultimately
would never come.

Four minutes into the second
period, Pitt scored making it 4-0.

Midway through the second, an
apparent Pitt goal was disallowed.
Just when it seemed something would
go Edinboro’s way, fifteen seconds
after the disallowed goal, Pitt’s
Shawn Goldstein scored giving Pitt a
commanding 5-0 lead.

One minute later, Elliott scored

on the power play making it 6-0.

Pitt continued to pile on the
offense, with 5:40 left in the second,
Elliott got the hat trick scoring his
third goal of the game giving Pitt a 9-
0 lead. A minute later, Ryan Moore
scored making it a 10-0 game.

As if going into double digits
wasn’t enough, Pitt scored a short
handed goal with just 1:44 left in the
period taking an ll—0 lead.

Pitt started off the third period by
quickly adding two more goals taking
a 13-0 lead. The rest of the third peri-
od belonged to Pitt, specifically team
captains Elliott and White.

Elliott scored his fourth and fifth

! 19

goals of the game and with just 25
seconds left in regulation, White
scored his first goal of the season giv-
ing Pitt a 16-0 victory.

“I was ecstatic,” White said. “I
was happy to finally score.”

White said Head Coach Dickie
Rizzo said he wanted to set the tone
early in the game, Pitt definitely suc-
ceeded by setting a tone Edinborojust
couldn’t play against. '

“It wasn’t that Edinboro was a
bad team, everything just came
together for us,” Elliott said.

Pitt plays again on Saturday, Nov.
16 at Neville Ice Rink in South Side
at 10:30 p.m.

THE PITT NEWS

Allen Iverson, the ex—Hoya point
guard who was taken first overall by
the 76ers, has put his name on the
early list for Rookie of the Year.
Combined with the explosive Jerry
Stackhouse, Philly now has some-
thing that might keep all the locals
there, instead of coming to
Pittsburgh to complain for four (or
sometimes five) years.

Georgetown czar John
Thompson was fuming after Iverson
decided to bolt, considering that the
likes of Ewing, Mourning,‘ and
Mutombo all stayed put and honored
their scholarships. However, it
seems like he has made the right
choice so far. He is sixth in the
league in scoring (23.7 ppg) and
made the highlight reel Tuesday
night when he scored a career-high
35 for the game as Philly knocked
off the Knicks.

The Knicks threw everything at
Iverson, including Wallace. Wallace
made a smart move going back to
school last year instead of staying in
the draft. His stock rose even though
‘he was slighted when ‘he was taken
18th by New York. So far, he has
averaged 10.3 points and 4.3
rebounds per contest on a team that
doesn’t seem to have enough room in
the Garden for their egos. Pretty
impressive.

Ray Allen and Vil1anova’s Kerry

greatness in the early stages of the
year. Maybe because they both play
on lousy teams, or maybe because I
really have a point in this story.
Nevertheless, they have put some
respectable numbers. The former
UConn star is averaging 15.3 ppg
while Kittles has put up a decent 6.0
PPg-
John Thompson had enough to
worry about with Iverson leaving,
but he also had to replace a pair of
big men who jumped to the pros —

‘ Williams and Harrington. Harrington

was supposed to be the next Ewing
in Hoyaland; instead, he played back
seat to the flashy Iverson and never
lived up to his huge billing. Williams
was on the opposite end of the stick.
He overachieved in Georgetown and
played his way to the 26th pick in the
first roundto the Pistons. Williams
hasn’t put the biscuit in the basket
yet in his six minutes of action.
Harrington has done some clean
up work for Hakeem and Sir Charles

in Houston, averaging 3.3 ppg and

grabbing 2.3 rebounds per appear-
ance. Tuesday night, he ran intothe
wrecking ball we all know and love,
the 7-foot passive giant from UConn
— Travis‘ Knight.

Many people wanted Knight to
have his head checked when he
turned down an offer from the Bulls.
Chicago GM Jerry Krause wanted
Knight to play in Europe for a year

to improve his interior game and
then return to the States and sign
with the Bulls for next season and a
guaranteed contract.

Knight didn’t like the offer and
pulled a Clampet, moving to L.A. —
swimming pools, movie stars, Shaq,

and Kobe. With the Lakers so
stacked, Knight decided to ride the
pine and become one of those
freaky—tal1 NBA'nomads like Chuck
Nevitt and Jon Koncak. Tuesday
night he broke out of his conserva-
tive, New England shell as he was
forced into action against 'the
Rockets after Shaq fouled out.‘
Going up against the dream had
to be a Knightmare, but the zealous

Laker wasn’t fazed, at least as time i

wore on. He was hacked by Barkley
the first time he got his paws on the
ball and proceeded to airball his first
free-throw.

Fine, maybe he’s not that good
and that degree might come in handy
after all. But, he hit the next one and

got back on defense to face Hakeem. _

Olajuwon was primed and ready to
eat the youngster alive; instead
Knight swatted, OK he tipped, a shot
by the Dream and recovered the ball
to secure the Laker double OT win:
By the way,-has anyone seen or
heard about Jerry McCullough?

editor for The Pitt News.

and that it cannot be overlooked.
He also said that the scrambling
ability of quarterback Matt Lytle
has him a little worried.

Head Coach Johnny Majors has
already shown his dedication to
getting some experience this year
for the team’s future stars. Pitt has
started an unusual amount of fresh-

men and redshirt freshmen this year *

for a Division I program. It’s kind
of like on-the—job training.

True-freshman Nathan Kirby
believes Majors is right.

“He’s doing what’s best for us
now,” Kirby said. “We know what
to expect up there. Notre Dame has
some pretty big guys. We hit the
rocks early, but we didn’t give up.
Now we’re sticking together and
having fun. Now we’re a team.”

“Die Schwartze Krahe
Cabaret”
I. V. Productions

I’m certain those of you
who missed I. V.
Productions’ “Die
Schwartze Krahe Cabaret”
are steeped in regret, but
allow me to further your
depression by telling you
precisely what you missed
out on.

Aside from extremely
creative film clips, solid
direction, and perfectly-
timed lighting and audio
(thanks to Lisa Beidel and
Matthew Ford), the acting
was nothing short of phe-
nomenal. For starters, I sim-
ply can’t say enough good
things about Marie Sirokos’
portrayal of the sexually-

eccentric Salome. She com-
manded the audience’s
attention and refused to let
go. Complimenting this per-
formance was Glen Hackett
as John the Baptist. I’ve
never had the pleasure of
seeing Glen in any other
shows, but I hope to, as his
natural talent is quite obvi-
ous. Shawn Watts’ comical
role of a disgruntled
mechanic added some
much-needed levity to the
intense nature of the show.
Both Ashley Wells (who
played a Vestal virgin), and
Kara Gillotti (who played
the extreme opposite of
one), possessed good stage
presence, as they both man-
aged to make you respect
them and sympathize with
them.

Let us not forget two
beautifully done roles from
Sue Galloway and Brent
Korsen who did so well you
wished they had more stage
time. And last, but definitely
not least, the directors of the
show, Joel Lee Kulp and
Aaron Christian Harms,
were perfect aesthetically
and performance wise in
their roles. All in all, these
amateur directors did such a
quality job one would never
guess it was only their sec-
ond production.

Don’t fret too much if
you missed the Nick Cave
One Acts. Just be sure to
catch I. V. Productions next
project: a take-off of Hamlet
that, if done, promises to be
intensely original.

Ghostface Killah
Ironman

Razor Sharp/ Epic

With their I993 debut, Enter the Wu—Tang (36 Chambers),
the Wu—Tang Clan laid the framework for what would soon
become a rap empire. Solo releases from the Method Man, Ol’
Dirty Bastard, Raekwon the Chef, and the Genius soon fol-
lowed, with each offer delivering an original recipe to the
Shaolin menu. To many, the Wu—Tang Clan are merely the
result of watching too many old Kung Fu flicks during all—day

blunt sessions. But to those in the know, the release of a new
Wu record is anticipated like summer vacation. Well kids, the

fifth solo album in the Wu—Tang legacy has arrived. Enter the »

sixth Chamber of Death, where the Ghostface Killah awaits
with Ironman. 4 _

Ironman, like the previous Wu—Tang solo efforts, is a col-
laborative family production." Witness the vocal ‘dexterity of

HamIet...stiII bummed out after all these years

“Hamlet” is perhaps the all-time
most read and performed play in the his-
tory of English literature, and with good
cause, too. It is a timeless story written
by a master storyteller and poet, and it
has been a source of great interest in
every generation since Shakespeare’s.

A very well—directed production of
“Hamlet” is now playing at the Stephen
Foster Theatre, in repertory with
“Rosencrantz” and Guildenstern Are
Dead,” the parody of “Hamlet”written
by Tom Stoppard. I have not seen the
latter play yet, but I was quite impressed
with the former. There were a few weak
links, but on the whole, it was a good
production.

Director W. Stephen Coleman has
done a wonderful job of making sure
that the action fits the dialogue (though
I’m not certain that I agree with all of
his interpretations). For example, dur-
ing the scene when Prince Hamlet tries
to “catch the conscience of the king”
with a play depicting his father’s mur-
der, there in an exceedingly long
amount of time that passes before the
king catches on the action of the play
within the play. When we consider the
scene itself, this seems odd. But
Coleman has succeeded in making this
work by having the king make out with
his wife throughout most of the play,

paying no attention to the play itself
until it is almost over! There are several
of these wonderful touches that should
impress anybody who has read the play
several times and wondered how the
performance should look.

There is also a great scene with the
gravedigger — certainly the best of the
play — when Hamlet and Horatio (who,
by the way, is played by a woman,
Lorien Clemens) come back to
Denmark. The comedy is delivered with
expert skill and impeccable timing.

But that
scene, won-
derful as it
is, seems
rather out of place in this production.
Hamlet appears to us happy and laugh-
ing, when, throughout all of the rest of
the play, he is portrayed as quite angry
and worked up. This prince, played by
KenYatta Rogers, doesn’t show us
much range in his performance. While
most readers agree that Hamlet suffers
from extreme melancholy, this prince
shows only anger through most of the
play — including the long soliloquies in
which Hamlet is undoubtedly supposed
to be sad! Rogers is an incredibly ener-
getic and physical actor, but this charac-
ter doesn’t seem to warrant that kind of
performance.

 

On the other hand, Polonius, who is
also played by a woman, Lamby Hedge,
delivers her comedy with skill through-
out the whole play. While not every-
body agrees that Polonius should be
played that way, it is still a wonderful
performance. '

Michelle Aqua Proctor, who plays
Ophelia, has a wonderful singing voice.
However, she sings those confusing
songs of Ophelia’s the same way that
she acts as Ophelia: with much passion.
I was always possessed that Ophelia
should be
rather quiet
and submis-
sive, which
lends to the plausibility of her mental
torture causing her suicide.

Also, Proctor, like Kashi Johnson,
who plays Gertrude, does not seem to
have a strong grasp of iambic pentame—
ter. Their lines are recited like everyday
dialogue, without rhythm and meter,
which can make them easier to follow
but loses the aesthetic appeal of the
poetry.

Coleman made an interesting cast-
ing decision for Claudius. John Koch,
who appears to be in his 20s, played the
king, while Bill Caisley, who is much
older, played both the ghost, and the
player!?!? Wouldn’t it have made more

sense to cast Caisley in both parts, since
he would have looked much more like
himself and hence much more like his
own brother, than a much younger
Coleman? Coleman is a good actor, and
pulls the part off well, but for purely
visual reasons, the casting here seems
odd.

Overall, the cast does a good job,
the director a great job (save for his
questionable interpretations), and the
set design is marvelous. The stage lends
itself very readily to all of the action,
and I am interested to see how it works
for the production of “Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead.”

Finally, we come to Rosencrantz
and Guildenstem, who are played by
David Novinski and Benjamin Corbett
Smith, respectively (I think). These two
seem like fine actors, even in the small
parts which they were given , by
Shakespeare, and I am very much look-
ing forward to seeing them in lead roles
when I go back for the second play.
Rosencrantz (or maybe it’s
Guildenstem — I can’t tell) has a won-
derful knack for facial expressions, and
I am expecting them to do wonderful
jobs in Tom Stoppard’s parody. I can’t
wait to see it.

Interested in seeing clothes and shoes
fonned from clay and ceramic vases of all shapes,
sizes, and colors? If so, then the Conney M.
Kimbo . Gallery found within the William Pitt
Union is the place to visit.

A new arts display entitled “Pots and
Outﬁts” opened Nov. 4 in the Kimbo Gallery and
runs until Dec. 7. The reception which took place
on Saturday, Nov. 9, was attended by Pitt students
as well as local artisans and supporters of the arts
and gave those people who came a chance to
greet and meet the artists. ‘

Jorge Montemayor, director of Ceramic Arts
for the Manchester Craftmen’s Guild, created all
the ceramic pots and pen and ink drawings with-
in the collection while Io Palmer, a recent gradu-
ate from Temple University’s Tyler School of Art
and current instructor at the Manchester
Craftmen’s Guild, added to the display with her
ceramic clothing, shoes, and salt and pepper shak-
ers.

Montemayor, who is also an instructor for
the Carnegie Museum of Art, became interested
in pottery and ceramics after taking a course to
fulﬁll his general education requirements in col-
lege. After being exposed to the world of pottery,
he changed his major from parks and recreation to
the arts and never looked back. His work has been
affected by a variety of inﬂuences ranging from

‘ Japanese to Mexican folk pottery which is evident

in what he terms the quiet nature of his pots and
the fact that they are meant to be placed in pet}
ple’s homes, to be picked up and experienced
rather than just seen.

As for the pen and ink_ drawings,
Montemayor used to draw sketches to get himself
ready for his pottery until a friend saw them and
encouraged him to display the drawings as well as
the pots at exhibits — a suggestion he took.

“Art is an outlet for me to deal with my
work,” said Montemayor, “I am always dealing

The Hottest State
Ethan Hawke
Lillie, Brown & Company

How does a sensitive, young, horny actor get
laid in NYC? Being authentic and true to the lan-
guage of ﬂowers, William directs his heart
towards a shy, sassy Sarah, who comes to New
York City, like William, to make true of her
dream. As the relationship runs wild, they cripple
each other in their transition from loneliness to
companion bliss.

From the miles of words and lengths of sim-
iles, Ethan Hawke compliment:-; the think tank of
young America with his ﬁrst novel, “The Hottest
State.” Yes, this is the same Ethan Hawke who
starred in Dead Poet Iv Society and, more recently,
Reality Bites and Before Sunrise. .

The vision of Hawke’s novel is typical of
most boy—meets—girl stories with obvious ‘90s
overtones; he’s practically the poster boy of
Generation VIP. William is like most of Hawke’s
movie characters. He dresses in his favorite black
jeans and leather jacket, his hair rarely ﬁnds the
straight-edges of a comb, and his face can’t come
to temrs with a razor.

As he compares Sarah, the choice of desire
of William’s loins, to former girlfriends and other
women, he says she isn’t that perfect but she’s the
one. She is the type of girl who bites her lips and
looks away from you with a smile. Her clothes are
vintage and her hair is cut so that it hangs in her
face when she speaks to people. Sarah is shy, and
William loves her, or he makes himself think

Io Palmer was bom in Greece into a family
of artists who instilled creativity within the house-
hold and cultivated the artistic side of their chil-
dren. She uses her interest in organic foods and
cooking, which she received from her mother,
within her artwork as a means of revealing how
food affects people’s everyday lives. She began
her ceramic shoe series when she ﬁrst listened to
and was inspired by the funk music of the 1970s
and the colors and images of the ‘70s’ decade. She

place setting and will shortly begin to make pup-
pets out of clay.

‘Through my art 1 reveal the idea of my par-
ents,” said Palmer, “and how their work has inﬂu-
enced my wor .” ’

“I originally concentrated on painting until
the day I visited the Ceramics department,” said
Palmer. ‘The artists were having so much fun and
I wanted to try. I love the feeling of working with
clay. It is more of a physical thing instead of a
cerebral thing.”

The reaction of the numerous people who
attended the reception of the ceramic arts display
was extremely positive and many commented on
the originality of the artwork. “It’s an eclectic col-
lection of ceramic pieces because you wouldn’t
think that you could make clothing out of clay,”
said Katie Fischer, Pitt Program Council arts
director. “The clothing and shoes show a lot of
Io’s colorful personality.” ,

For those interested in seeing the pottery and
ceramics display, the Conney M. Kimbo Gallery
is open Monday through Thursday 10-6 p.m.,

one actually from Manhattan?), William wants to

become an actor and doesn’t even oonsider the ’

idea of college; he just wasn’t concerned with it.
He’s not fond of prophylactics and drinks too
much (he’s a rebel but a devil). Hawke describes
VV1lliam as an emotional boy, who just wants to be
in the right place at the right time, usually the mis-
sionary position. He wants Sarah, and Sarah
wants William.

William, drowning his sentimental sorrow,
introduces himself to Sarah, who’s hanging with
her friends at a bar. Their initial conversation is
awkward like most drunk ﬂirtations, and their lips
meet in a late night stroll. They fall madly infatu-
ated with one another, and William and Sarah
love the idea of being a couple. They can make
you ill with their match-making. Rumors spread

, about their lack of bedroom noise, and Sarah

doesn’t mind. VVrlliam does. In ratio of l to 2, he
observes and negotiates her mental attributes as
well as her feminine curves. William loves Sarah
for more than sex. ,

The pen is written with the honest dialect of
a weary William, like a 19€>page soliloquy. The

male “over-emotional” type goes head—to-head _

with the female “passive-aggressive” type in this
endearing novel. The Hottest State is a very quick
read with adequate illustrations of New York
City’s Lower East Side, which delivers a nice
emotional check for the readers. This novel could
be a nice instructional for those men who thinks
ﬂowers are the only way to say “I’m sorry,” rather
than saying the actual words. ‘

lling In The hleuv Year!

“Roots rock” seems to be
the accepted term these days for
rock music that makes heavy
use of folk music instrumenta-
tion. Harmonica, mandolin, ﬁd-
dle, organ, accordion — when
you take these and add a solid
rock’n’roll drum beat and guitar
line, you’ve got roots rock.

A few roots rockers can be
found on the pop charts today -
the Wallﬂowers, Tom Petty, the
Crash Test Dummies — but for

the most part, musicians in this _

genre tend to congregate just
outside the circle of mainstream
popularity, only occasionally
popping their heads in to look
around and toss out a single in

-hopes that a DJ somewhere will

give it a chance.

Pittsburgh is fortunate
enough to have one radio sta-
tion, the listener-funded WYEP
91.3 FM, thatfeatures roots rock
every day. Between 6 am and 6
p.m. — especially during Joe
Resh’s 6 to 10 morning music
mix — WYEP plays big—label
roots rockers such as the
BoDeans and Los Lobos as well
as local musicians like
Ploughman’s Lunch and The
Gathering Field

This fall has seen the

release of major retrospectives
by two pivotal roots rock acts:
L.A.’s master craftsman of psy-
chopathically beautiful songs,
Warren Zevon, and
Pennsylvania’s own Grarnrny—
nominated artists, The Hooters.

The Hooters
Hooterization: A Retrospective

Columbia/Legacy

The Hooters are named -
despite what you might think —
after their signature instrument,
the melodica or “hooter,” essen-
tially a harmonica with a piano
keyboard. The melodica is the
instrument heard in the opening
bars. of the first track on
Hooterization — and the band’s
biggest hit “And We
Danc .” A perennial radio

favorite, this song had the unfor-

tunate side effect of identifying
the Hooters so thoroughly with
the ‘80s that most people think
they’re just another arena jock-
rock band

This perception is shattered
by Hooterization. Tracks such as
“Fightin’ on the Same Side”
with its skip-along mandolin
and ever-hopeful lyrics of recon-
ciliation, “S00 Miles” with its

dark reggae groove and wailing

with its unsettling contrast
between lilting Celtic melody
and ominous minor—key vocal
harmonies, all demonstrate what
Philadelphia music fans have
known for a decade and a half:
no one sails the musical waters
between the lands of rock and
folk quite like the Hooters.

If any one song embodies
the Hooters’ inﬂuence on recent
musical trends, it’s “Brother,
Don’t You Walk Away,” an ago-
nized contemplation of the
plight of the homeless. Released
as a single in 1989, it failed to
gain national attention -— but
several years later, songs like the
Gin Blossoms’ “Hey, Jealousy”
and Soul Asylum’s “Black
Gol ” became hits by vaguely
approximating its sound and
keeping the angst, but not the
penetrating thoughtfulness.

The high point of the col-
lection is unquestionably the
Cajun-ﬂavored “Karla with a K”
— interestingly, the only track
credited to all the Hooters rather
than just songwriting duo Eric
Bazilian and Rob Hyman. The
band is at its ﬁnest on “Karla,”

duced in the past 30 years that
wasn’t written by Lennon &
McCartney.

Themandolin and melodica shape lhe Hoolers’ unique sound.

Speaking of the Beatles, the
Hooters’ love for them is evi-
denced not only by their non-tra-
ditional live rendition of “Lucy
in the Sky with Diamonds,” but
also by their hometown ballad
“Beat Up Guitar,” a homage to
“Penny Lane” ttanslocated from
Liverpool to “the town that
rocked the nation: Philadelphia,
PA.”

Disc one spans Zevon’s career

songs feature Zevon’s brilliantly

of Eagles—style country rock. These

owning and breeding of pit
bulls has been an increasing
trend in Los Angeles these past
few years. The pits are bought
and sold primarily for the pur-

thousands of badly mutilated
dogs have been left in the
streets of South Central to die
or wander in packs. The cruelty
of this so—called sport is unfath-

This animal abuse in a

symptom of the desensitization

America are surrounded by
images of death everyday. Real

have become commonplace,

this reality inﬂuence all comers

true, considering the fact that
art, as cliché as it sounds, does
mirror life. Gangsta rap appeals
to our desire to act out our own

Anyone listening to gangs-
ta rap, and a lot of rock in gen-
eral, is in a certain sense a para-
sitic voyeur, peering into a dark
world where the protagonists
are engaged in a type of war
with the rest of the world. We
tune in to the East Coast/West
Coast hostility and hype and get
turned on. When lyrics result in
real violence and death it only
heightens our excitement.
Obviously, these things are

the violence in the music is a
result of the violence of real
life. But this doesn’t explain the
popularity of gangsta rap with
suburban white kids, or with

like myself. The appeal of a

funky groove is life-affirming,

but when that groove is accom-
panied by lyrics about 13 year-

is because the sickness is in the

Tha Doggfather
Snoop Doggy Dogg
Death Row Records

On his second
album, _ Tha
Doggfather, which

ally Tuesday, Snoop
Doggy Dogg address-
es tgangsta rap’s
detractors with the
prototypic “Fuck all
y’all” that works so effectively on disc.
Tha Doggfather is to be Snoop’s come-
back album,‘ and he plans to tour exten-
sively in support of it, something he was
unable to do after the release of his
debut album, Doggystyle, because he
faced murder charges. Now, having been
acquitted, his return to the rap game is
being seen as the ﬂagship for the “new
and untouchable” Death Row Records.
The 21 tracks on Tha Dogﬁather
(some of which are merely short filler

dialogue pieces) are produced by a"

handfull of different people, including
Dat Nigga Daz, DJ Pooh, Arkim, Flair,
and Snoop himself. This is in sharp con-
trast to the singular musical control that
Dr. Dre had on Doggystyle, and practi-
cally every other previous Death Row
release. To me, the funk just
ain’t there on most of this
record. Most of the tracks
have a candy—assed pop feel,
which in itself isn’t bad, see-
ing as Snoop is essentially a
pop artist. It’s just that hard
rhymes and weak beats do not

laid back Snoop’s vocal style
is, without Dre’s trademark
deep bass groove.

Some cuts do - shine
through on a funk tip. “Gold
Rush,” a tale of today’s Wild
West Coast, is outstanding.
The outlaw parallels have
been drawn before by other
hip hop groups, but this does-

After the death of rapper Tupac Shakur, and with
Death Row CEO Suge Knight in jail, there has
recently been much speculation about the future of
the record label, artistically and financially. Without
the extraordinary production talents of label co-
founder/hitmaker Dr. Dre (who moved on to greener
pastures in March when he formed his own label),

area are

 

n’t lessen the effect or
the truth inherent in
dropping Wild West
allusions. “Freestyle
Conversation” allows
Snoop to show off his
real talent for bustin’
badass rhymes,
unhindered by con-
straints of a straight
beat.

Speaking of
beats, while most are
unimpressive, there is an appealing .‘80s
feel to some of the snares, particularly
on “Doggyland,” where, as with most of
the record, Snoop name drops the LBC,
his Long Beach Crew. The album, as the
title implies, is also littered with refer-
ences to Italian mob families, both real
and fictional. “Downtown Assassins” is
certainly inﬂuenced by the mad produc-
tion of a Wu Tang joint, which is ironic
considering the whole East Coast/West
Coast tension thing. But this new sound
is indicative of Dre’s absence, and with
it, a looser interpretation of the whole
West Coast sound.

Slightly disturbing lyrically, along
with the typical violence and misogyny,
is the song “(Tear ‘Em Off) Me & My

these latest blows to the label have been seen by
many as indications of a greater picture in which
gangsta rap as a genre is a dying (or dead) art form.
In the past two weeks, two major albums have
been released by Death Row, through which the label
hopes to maintain its status as gangsta rap‘s definitive
collective voice. A posthumous Tupac Shakur record.

The Don to assassinate the
Killuminati, the character of not
Seven Day Theory only Mr. Shakur,

W h e n ous at Tupac’s,

Shakur’s fifth solo Makaveli’s verbal

finally an album
for political junkies. Had Tupac, in
his alter ego, which fades in and
out throughout the album, finally
written something the Political
Science department would make
required reading?

No. ,

Instead what we have is a rap

album that will probably appeal to-

those who liked Tupac’s work in
the past, but . won’t give any
Machiavelli fans new perspectives.

The album opens with a radio
news—like announcement about the
release of the album. There are
bells tolling in the background and
the reader says that :

“A number of less fortunate
rappers have joined in a conspiracy

   
  
  
  
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
   
 
 
 
    

 

Notorious PIG and
several other New York rappers ..
Tupac, rather Makavelli, was not
available for comment, but
released this statement: ‘It’s not
about east or west, it’s about nig-
gers and bitches, power and
money, and riders and punks,
which side are you on?”’

Gunshots follow.

So, how does all this fit in with
what Machiavelli actually said?

Above all, Tupac’s demise

shows that although he supposedly A

read “The Prince” more than once,
he obviously skipped over the
chapters on how to be feared and
not hated.

Anyone who reads “The
Prince” probably has different
parts that they focus on,
but it seems that Tupac,

parts that most
Machiavelli fans would
focus on. This is all right
because this review is
probably missing the
things Tupac’s fans would
focus on.

He does have
Machiavellian tendencies
in several tracks, but his
reading on the whole
leaves something to be
desired.
