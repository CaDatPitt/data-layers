Churchman Quads
Sorority Walls

It’s all Greek to us. .We
knew that the sororities went
by Greek names but when di-
aling the Phi Sigma Sigma
house, the deep ‘bass voice that
_ answered informed his caller

in a very resigned tone that ’
he was’ connected with the
Saint Nicholas Greek Ortho-
dox Church, not a sorority. . ~
The gist of it is that the
women’s, handbook, Vade Me-
cum, goofed when it printed
the Phi Sigma Sigma phone
number. Instead of the num-
ber listed in the book, persons
desiring to call the sorority
should try’ dialing Museum
1-8695. They'll probably be
able to get the younglady they
want instead of the disgruntled

churchman.

Sharp Cuts

Drastic cutsin the national
budget have caused reductions
in the number of men, pri-
marily juniors and seniors,
‘who may enter Air Force.'Ac—
cording to C01. John'E. Mur-
ray, professor of Air Science and
Tactics, some 700 ‘students enroll-
ed at Pitt during the Sept. 12-16
ROTC registration. Of these, the
school will admit 255 or less to the
‘upperclass phase of training.

Desire to Fly Necessary

Stipulations for entrance in ad-
vanced ROTC are that candidates
must desire ﬂight training and be
physically qualiﬁed to ﬂy. Only a
small number of persons in spe-
cialized ﬁelds may enter advanced
without ﬂight training. '

At the present time all seniors
at Pitt will be enrolled. However,
those in administration will re-
ceive no commissions after gradu-
ation, but rather a certificate of
eligibility. Cadets in engineering
will receive a limited number of
commissions; all pilots will be as-
the regular Air
Force. _ ‘

Of those cadets in the Junior
class 83% who are in ﬂight train-
ing will be assured of commis-
sions; depending on the size of the
class the percentage of ranks may
go up to one hundred.

’ From Sorbonne to Pit

 

After the PhD m mechamcs, Anything

Post After World Travels

By JINI BENDER
Don’t c’est se bon—say Sorbonne, and watch the

light

come into the eyes of Dr. Donald E. Swarts, new director of

student publications.

Dr. Swarts, who received three degrees from Pitt, lived
in Europe for ﬁve years. During his stay in Paris, he was

secretary and_ manager_ of the¢

United States Students’ and Art-
ists’ Club. Although the club was
sponsored by the American Epis-
copal Church for American and
English students studying at the
Sorbonne, the club was strictly a
“left—bank Bohemian affair,” ac-
cording to Dr, Swarts.
' Tarried in Europe

Unlike many travellers, Dr.
Swarts had no special purpose in
mind when he went to Europe.
“I left in 1929” he said, “and the
depression hit while I was‘ on the
boat. Since there were no jobs in
the U. S. I had no reason to hur-
ry home.”

The “visit” stretched into ﬁve
years, four of which were spent
in Paris. After a year in Spain
and Africa the young man who
was born in Brookeville, Pa., de-
cided to come ‘home. '

The Pittsburgh district became
home and‘Dr. Swarts taught here
until World .War II caught up with
him." “I didn’t know anything
about mechanics,” he said, "‘but
since I came out on top in the
mechanical apptitude test they
sent me to school and I became a
instructor.” Dr.
Swarts’ “Ph.D. in mechanics”
came when he achieved the crown-
ing glory of tearing down. a GMC
truck and putting it back together.
Lawrence Thesis Ready fpr Press

In 1947 Dr. Swarts found him-
self back at Pitt preparing for a
Ph.D. in English. Last June he
completed his thesis. “Criticism
of D .H. Lawrence.” It is now be-
ing prepared for publication.

Dr. Swarts emphasized that the
work, which will probably be in
three volumes, is the ﬁrst collect-

ed and catalogued literary criti-
cism of D. H. Lawrence. At the
present time Dr. Swarts is adapt-
ing some of the material in ar-
ticle form. '
Not All Work, No Play

In spite of all the work Dr.
Swarts is far from being a dull
boy. He is organist ,and choir-
master at the First Methodist

Church in Aliquippa and one of ‘

the original sponsors of Skyscrap-
er Engineer, a student publication
which has consistently won hon-
ors in the magazine ﬁeld.

Dr. Swarts’ wife, who has »a
Ph.D. in elementary education, is
also interested in music. At the.
present time she is on the faculty
of Indiana State Teachers’ College.

Dr. Swarts is in a new position
as director of student publications,
but any man who has a Ph.D. in
English and can put a GMC truck
together is well equipped for any
situation he may face.

Blazers Come to Pitt

Starting a new tradition in a, college or university is
usually akin to adding 40 pounds to a soldier’s pack, but the
instigators of the Pitt Blazer tradition may have discovered
a “natural.-” Long criticized for having no identifying sweat-
er, jacket or coat that would represent Pitt through’ all its
students,‘ Pitt contented its members with conglomeration
of sweat shirts and jackets that varied as much in design
as did-the shape of the wearer. Now, under the leadership
of Druids, men’s sophomore honorary, attractive, well-cut
blue, blazers have been ordered for sale to Pitt students.

    

8:9.» nook

7-Morgan and Kaufman,- a ﬁrm located at 1021 Fifth Ave.,
_ has contracted to supply the navy-blue worsted coats and

already has sold 50 of the blazers. Priced at $22.50, the

.,_1co,at is encrested with the University Seal on the left breast

pocket.

Chancellor Rufus H.‘Fitzgerald and Dean of Men Theo-
dore " W. Biddle have purchasedsblazers and given’ their
whole—hearted approval to the project. Many of the Druids
and activity leaders are sporting their coats now with
orders piling up for more. Students who have not com-
pleted’ the process of buying their back-to-school clothes-
or_who need something to ﬁll out their wardrobe will«ﬁnd
the blazer a digniﬁed item of apparal that will ﬁll the bill
admirably. Without trying to go overboard‘ on the “rah-
rah” idea, the blazertradition will be an excellent advertise-
ment for Pitt and as it becomes known among other colleges
it will furnish no little prestige to its wearers. It may also
serve to silence the haberdashers who constantly shun some

of the eastern colleges and seek out the Ivy League members

for their clothing trends.

Returns from Project Imlia

Last Spring, Pitt-’s Alma Mater, Mary Fuget, was select-
ed by a national committee as one of a group of seven
students who would travel through India on a ten-week
tour of the country. Labeled “Project Indian,’,’, the tour
was an inter-racial, inter-faith ‘experiment in international
relations with American, students from Pitt, Syracuse Uni-
versity, ‘Cornell, and Smith College meeting, living, and
Working with the people of India.

In order that Miss Fuget could take part in the pro-
ject various organizations,» fraternities and sororities, as
well as individuals contributed $2500 to the fund for her
trip. Now Miss Fuget, has returned and tomorrow, during
the Chapel service from 1. to 1:25 p.m., she will replace
Chaplain Luccock in order to describe her trip and -the
wealth of experiences acquired during the tour. Here is
an excellent chance for the students and faculty members
who so graciously contributed to the expense fund to see
and hear the recipient of their donations’ and derive from
her talk the beneﬁts of Project India. A ﬁrst hand account
of such an experience is worthwhlie to say the least, but
with the knowledge that your money helped makejpossible
such an experimentzand the pride in the fact that a Pitt
student was selected for the honor, there should not be
an empty seat in Heinz Chapel tomorrow.

Forthe Imaginative Soul if

By Ruth t-Leimbuecher,
I caught up on my periodical reading this sum-
mer. Among the cobwebbed, dusty volumes that

‘ had accumulated all year was an issue of “The

Reader’s Digest.” In it was an article describing

the variety and great number of patents issued»

each year for new “inventions.” ‘

People were, I discovered, inventing everything
from hats that would double as -
life preservers to shoe horns that
played a tune.

The worthlessness of. the
things described in the piece, '-
,“You, Too, Can Invent a Gad-
get,” soon had me convinced that
I could invent a gadget as use-
less, if not more useless, than ,
the ones I read about. I i
tried.

Sheep for Sleep

. For unimaginative insomniacs, I devised a lum-

_ inous mechanism for the bedroom ceiling in the

shape of a sheep for those whowant to count them

‘but can’t envisage them. At the touch of a but-

ton at the bedside, the sheep jumps over a picket
fence -(also luminous). If , the would—be sleeper
prefers, .he or she may substitute other animals
in place of the sheep, a pet dog or cat, for in-
stance. V

Egotistical insomniacs may purchase the ﬁgure
of a man‘ (if a woman) or a woman (if a man)
to leap the fence. ,
For the woman who is a nervous lip-biter, I
have invented a new type of lipstick. To be
called Vita-Lip, it will contain a composite of all
the vitamins known to be essential. Some tubes

when he heard a voice call,
“Tom! Tom! It’s me,‘ Henry
George. Did you get my book?”

Tom yawned. “I got your
book, Henry. I ﬁnally found it
at the University of Pittsburgh
bookstore. It’s a rather new
school, but they have a nice se-
lection of books. Yours cost $5.50'plus tax.”

“Tax?”, said Henry. “What ' for?”

“A sales tax,” said Tom. “They have it on
almost everything in Pennsylvania."

Henry gruntedp. “Leave it to the Democrats.

They tax anything they can see.”

A “You’re mistaken this time, Henry. The Re-

publicans started this one. Of course, they did

Tom smiled. “You’ve been away from the world

By John De Ninno
With a slogan that would do
justice to a football coach’s pre-

gress Assemblies Committee has
launched another season.

According to the slogan the
committee wants “Blood, Sweat,

fine example of another type of

Good Chance for Pitt

The show will be carried on a
national r a d i 0 hook-up and
should give the school a terriﬁc
amount of publicity, besides pro-
viding the student body with a
good show free of charge.

Right now the committee is not
a working unit. Paul Petro, its
chairman, has not received too
much cooperation from his staff.
The program mentioned above
was planned with little or no help
from the committee. The “Kick-
Off Dance” and rally scheduled

for Friday was also almost en-’

tirely Petro’s work. K

A committee such as the As-
semblies must have a good deal
of ground work completed before
the semester is under way.

that the student body remains in-

“Gem Dandy” Display

iHOldS Rubies and Jade

By _ANNA MAY BARTIROME

In a small eleventh ﬂoor classroom,‘ within an incon-

spicuous glass case rests ‘Pitt’s one and only “gem dandy”

geology display.

_ This display, according to Dr. C. E. Prouty, head of the
geology department, consists of a collection of gems, un-

- H polished stones, , and materials¢ "

used in making j,ew.elry and valu-

able articles of display.

Few students, even those who
take geology, realize that the dis-
play -actually exists within the
University.

. Some Gems Rea1,_ Some False

Several of.the gems, says Dr.

’ Prouty, are genuine, while others

aretsynthetic. Viewers can’t help
but “oh” and “ah” over the ﬁre
and streak in some stones and the
unusual shapes of others.

Dr.’ Prouty pointed out several
pieces_ of the lovely light green
jade, whichhad been carved in
various designs. There are ‘also
several pieces of pink _and green
ﬂuorite, highly unusual minerals
becauseof their tendency to split
smoothly and evenly when cut.

Lapis Lazuli, an expensive, eye-
catching, blue speckled’ stone, used
in making high quality jewelry is
on display a1so.. .

‘ Fire Opals Outstanding ,
"Genuine ﬁre opals are an out-

» standing part of the gem collec-

tion. These stones have intricate
dancing ﬁre streaks of green, blue,

, red, and orange,_ which shimmer

and move at the slightest jar.

' "Stones as these are used by jew-

elers in attractive rings and neck-

. laces.

Square green emeralds, a lit-
le blue star sapphire, round am-
ber citririe quartz stones, and a
large oblong red ruby are only
part of this miniature gem collec-

' tion_. '

A Beside the gem collection there
are several rock, mineral and fos-
sil displays. These do not hold as
much interest as the gems to those

who are not geology majors‘ or
instructors, nevertheless V. they are
unique and valuable.

Various pieces in these collec-
tions have been sent as gifts, pre-
sented’ and purchased from coun-
tries all over the world. Germany,
England, Egypt and Norway are
represented in this . geologic dis-
play.

Most of the material belongs to
several particular
which are always kept together.

The collection of Dr. F. Krantz
of Bonn, Germany, and the Foote
collection are two of the most out-
standing mineral displays. These
pieces are kept in large drawer
chests along the walls.

Old Fossils on Display

Fossilized sponges,- pearly nau-
tilus shells, and old plant fossils
are within huge glass cases.

According to Dr. Prouty, the
geology department was formerly
associated with the School of
Mines in State Hall. Eventually,
as the university expanded, the
displays were moved to the Ca-
thedral of Learning. During the
war, however, the displays were
kept ‘in the stadium, where they
remained until peace came again.

By PAUL HARRISON
Coach Carl Olson’s weeping towel became a bit drier
this week due to the ﬁrst showing in time trials by his
cross"-country proteges, Added to this, as the- result of the

.. four-mile jaunt through Schenley Park Saturday, the veteran

mentor had to eat crow for a statement hemade last week.
Senior Walt Starz, the elder member of the squad, led
the Harriers in their initial run crossing the line at 23:51.

Vie for ‘Berths

Freshman Coaches Steve Petro
and Carl DePasqua went into the
second week of drills as nine more
grid hopefuls turned up at the
Ellsworth Field training site to
increase the roster to 33 candi-
dates.

Petro appeared heartened over
the ﬁery spirit shown so far by his
ﬂock of recruits, which more than
makes up for their inexperience
as an organization.

“Though they have proven
themselves as individual perform-
ers elsewhere,” the former line-
man said, “they’ve still got a lot
to learn as a unit.-?’

Palatella Lost

The Greensburg star was used
on offense last year as a left half-
back and threw only nine passes
the entire season. At present,
though, Dawson says Hoffman
will be the starting quarterback in
the opener against West Virginia
in the Stadium Saturday.

Another surprise which deﬁn-
itely is a good sign, was a state-
ment by Trainer Howard Waite
that “unless something happens
-between now and Saturday, ev-
eryone except Lou Palatella will
be in pretty good shape by game-
time.”

Panther hopes dropped last
weekend when, on top of all the
other Pitt injuries, Palatella, who
was‘~being counted on because of
his experience playing both ways,
suffered a broken leg. The Van-
dergrift junior may be sidelined
the remainder of the season.

Kraemer Back

Other changes in Monday’s
scrimmage besides the move to
Trees Field for the workouts, saw
Chet Rice, a defensive letterman
in. 1952, replace sophomore Bob
Grier at left half and Bob Bal-
lock gaining the center position.

their cold noses in the scorecard while 30 or 40 players mill

15 yards, and conceivably a victory, the masterminds must there-
fore employ special devices to herd the ineligible sheep apart from
the eligible goats, as it were. .

One magazine mentions three methods which will probably come
into use. Frank Leahy is expected to assign one of his coaches the
job of checking subs. Georgia Tech plans onusing pullover shirts

of different colors on the bench. And Red‘ Dawson, among others, ,

is expected to go with the separate bench system, whereby‘ players
coming off the ﬁeld must sit apart until the speciﬁed period elapses.

Originally the rule called for a ﬁve yard penalty‘ any time
a culprit was caught, but this was considered too light a penalty
to pay for slipping in an interloper, either unintentionally or
shrewdly. Coaches are on their honor, of course, and until a new
system is devised, appeals are to be .made right on the ﬁeld when
a player’s eligibility is questioned.’ , v

Locally, Dawson may have trouble, by the way, as the result of
another new rule’recently adopted.

It seems that coaches are no longer permitted to wander up and
down the sidelines during play. . Someone may have to be assigned
to hold‘ the Redhead down when the game and the shoes grow tight.

W‘   Irish Halfbaclc Size

By. CARROLL COOK ‘ ,

. Although Pitt and Notre Dame do not meet for another

four weeks, modest Paul Reynolds, Irish halfback who was~

slated for.ﬁrst string this fall until he‘ re—injured hisright
knee two weeks ago in a dummy scrimmage, believes the
success of Notre Dame’s entire season hinges on the Oklahoma

. game. - - — p -
“Naturally, we are loking forward to the Pitt game
since you are the only team on:

this. —year’s schedule which whip-
ped us last fall, .
but if we lose
to the Sooners
we are going
to be in bad
shape. Maybe I '
could say the,
same thing if 2
you lose to
West Virginia.”

R e y 11 old s,
who has ﬁnish-
ed a prolonged
stay here, was
deeply disappointed when
learned he would be unable to
play this fall, following his op-
eration at the Mercy Hospital,
some ten days ago.

ND Feared Pitt V

“Our scouts warned us last year
about the Panthers. They said that
Pitt was the most improved team
on our schedule.’ I will say one
thing about the Panthers. No team
deserved to beat us more than
Pitt, not even mighty Michigan

the team, but there are places open
for anyone with the desire to par-
ticipate in any one of the seven
events, in which three men are
needed for each.

The events: high bar, parallel

bars, ﬂying rings, side horse, rope"

climb, tumbling, and trampoline.
Eight men are returning from
last year’s squad to form the pres-
ent backbone of the team—Ted
Strauss, Dick Manson, Bob Bal-
lock, Bob Kennedy, Ferguson
Founce, Ken Bluestone, Stan Gus-
ky, and Jerry Tonini. ,
Last year’s performances, which
were on a trial-basis, took place at
halftime at basketball games.

The schedule: Army at West
Point——Jan. 30; West Virginia at
home and away—February dates
to be set; and Ohio State at C0-
lumbus—Mar. 6.

downs while the Spartans had
their ﬁrst two scores given to them
by penalties.”

Reyolds had always wanted to

kid and although approached by
many colleges, the Springﬁeld star,
who also played basketball, pick-
ed his childhood choice.

Asked ‘ about his
plans, Reynolds said he plans to
work this semester and enroll
again in school next spring.

Irish Troubles
“This way,” he continued, ‘I
will be ‘able to play two more
years instead of one..” This is
bad news for Irish opponents.

“I read in the papers that Coach
Dawson is bemoaning early sea-
son injuries. Well, do not think
that we haven’t had our share.

“We lost Fran Paterra because
of scholastic‘ trouble and at the
moment, Johnny Lattner is hob-
bling around on his sore ankle.”

answering. “I do feel that we

but a number of players, especial-

Questioned about the one pla-.

ly linemen, played both ways last A

year. However, take Joe Heap,.the
boy who returned that punt against
you last year. He has never play-
ed defense—'not even in high
school.” ‘

On discussing the controversial
“sucker” shift, Reynolds said, “We
got the idea from Pitt. Nothing
was said when you used it against
us but, oh brother, when we suck-
ered USC, did the crying towels
ﬂy! As for not having a play after

A shifting, that is not true.”

Reynolds then shifted the cori-
versation from football to Pitts-
burghers. He showed all the cards

he received from people he did’

not know, and also said that he
got several‘ phone calls from fans.

“I enjoy Pittsburgh very much
and I will be looking forward to
our game here next year, but at
the present, I am worried about
the Oklahoma game. We just have
to win that-2" one!” . .
