State Error Causes Pitt Deficit

BY GARY LAMPENFELD
As a result of a $2.3 million
miscalculation by the State and a

_\reallocation of $160,000 from edu-

cational purposes to community re-
lated projects, Pitt faces a $2.9
milliondeﬁcit, Chancellor Wesley
Posvar announced at Thursday’s
University Senate meeting.

. The miscalculation’ resulted from‘

the State’s overlooking a budget

 
 
 

amendment, according. to Posvar.
He said because the amendment

was made after the original budget
was submitted, it was not consid-
ered. _ ' ‘

situation will! improve‘ from “cal-
amity to serious shortage,”_ «Posvar

;.said. ‘

osvar referred to the “serious
shortage" as the present status of
Penn State, Temple, and-the state
teachers’ colleges, and said Pitt’s
$2.9 million shortage is actually a
$3.5 {million shortage when ad-

A justed for inﬂation.



 

Posvar said the governor's bud-
get, based on a revised 15 month
ﬁscal year, provides for modest
increases for higher education.
Because of «these increases, Posvar

If the $2.9 million is restored, the _

predicted a tax increase next year

is inevitable. _

Regarding the University’s posi-
tion on such a tax hike, Posvar said,
“Our purpose won’t be to advocate
revenue increases, but to advance
our own cause.” I’

The University’s budget for in-
struction for next year is projected
at $85 million, said Posvar, adding
the budget was discussed with
student, faculty, and political lead-
ers, with the intention of sending

» forays of students and faculty, and

staff members to Harrisburg.
Posvar concluded as of now,

' reductions in University expendi-
tures are necessary, ‘but hopefully

can be restricted to supportive
programs. V

Also discussed on the Senate
Council, was School of General
Studies representation.

The present structure of the
Council consists of eight under-

.. graduate students; one from each

Pitt Cancels Overseas

French Studies, Program

BY CAL RITCHEY
Pitt hasrcancelled its exchange

program for French language stu’-A -
dents because of .lack of funds,

according to Dr. Frederic C. St.
Aubyn, chairman of the French and
Italian language departments.

Known as the “Rouen Plan,” the
special course draws_students from
across the United States to study at
the University of Rouen in France.
ifty-one terms of instruction for 39
students had been planned for next
year.

“The program was cancelled for
ﬁnancial reasons,” chairman St.
Aubyn said.

“It was a marginal ‘
. Pt9E¥?m==.it nsver 19‘ l   S

    
   

money, but it never ‘made a lot of
money either.”

"CAS Dean Jerome Rosenberg,
who announced the cancellation
Wednesday, explained the pro-

, gram-had been dropped because of

general budgetary restraints im-
posed on the University.
“Although it is a very good
program, it isn’t central to the
French Department’s main mis-
sion," said Rosenberg. It’s ex-
pensive for the University and the
individual student. The ﬁnancial
burden has been exacerbated by
differentials in inflation rates in
France and the United States.”

FAS Council Endorses  
Longer Withdrawal Time

_ BY W. JACK ROMBERG

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences
(FAS) Council voted Friday to
endorse a CAS Council resolution
that would extend the length of the
course withdrawal period until the
last day of the reading period.
resolution says,
“Courses may be dropped and a W
grade received at any time from the
10th day of the term through the
end of the Reading Period (ie the
last weekday before the beginning
of the Final Examination Perio’d).”

According to Dean Robert Mar-_
shall, this would help alleviate the
problem of illegal “ withdrawals
many professors grant to students
after the end of the current
withdrawal period, six weeks into
the term. I i

The reasons for illegal withdraw-
als _ range from sickness to a

‘professor’s sympathyfor a "student ’

who is overwhelmed. with work.

De‘an'“ Marshall’ added (another
reasonfor the extended withdrawal
period would be “tolet thetstudent
out of a bad situation.” I ' -

The motion to endorse the CASC, .

resolution passed by a 5-4 vote.‘ -.
Dr. Jonathan Harris of the Political
Science department opposed the
motion stating that it would
“encourage people to avoid the
risk of taking on a course.” -Harris
drew on his personal experience

with withdrawals, saying that last, ,

term 20 per cent of his students

Express Discontent

Sixty-eight of R100 students quer-
ied Tuesday in a random sampling
at ﬁve locations reacted negatively.

“Students automatically pay this’
fee without realizing" what it is
used for,” said Jane Alexander, a
Pitt student.

The $12 fee is collected from every
student and distributed through
Student Government (SG) to
recognized student organizations.
These organizations in turn provide
extracurricular activities. ‘ '

However, most students ex-
pressed dissatisfaction with the
so-called reaping of beneﬁts.

“I'm suspicious about how the

money is used and feel they could-

do more with the money they get,”

Peter Romanot said.-

-Some. commuters were concerned
about paying for activities that are
difﬁcult for them .to attend.
Commuter Jill Tokarsky qualiﬁed
this: “lt’s hard for commuters to
get here for activities. If you don't
attend all of them’, you won’t get
yourAmoney’s worth. There’s not
muchfor commuters."

Jeff McNerney agreed. -‘,‘Com-
muters pay for half the residents’
activities,” he said.

students. “The diversity ‘of
planning activities is not- where it
should be,” said Jay Hutchinson.

“They don't get enough student

‘opinion in planning activities,”-

Nancy Laird complained.

About a third of the students
interviewed said they receive their
money’s worth through "the activi-
ties fee. '
“Cultural events are excellent and
evening lectures with prominent
speakers are educational,” Cheryl
Skinger said. “Tickets cost a lot if
you don't have an ID.’’
5 Many of the satisﬁed students
said they get a return on the fee by
attending football and basketball
games. “I attended all the games,
so it’s worth it,” Mark Rickley
said.

The activities fee paid by the
students, however, does not cover

athletic events, according to Terry ,

Milani, associate directorof Stu-
dent Activities. “Student Activi-
ties does not allocate money for
athletic events. The Athletic

.Department makes the seats

available to the students free of
cost,” Milani said.

Axten proposed revisions to the
GPSA by-laws, including a reor-

— Jgganization of administrative struc-

{la-‘e to include a Cabinet system.

“The reorganization with Cabinet
positions depends on people willing
to fill them," Axten said. He
added Cabinet members should be
prepared to serve for the better
part of a year.

The Assembly agreed with Ax-
ten’s suggestion to place an
advertisement in the Pitt News to
seek people to fill other Cabinet
positions, which are open to any
graduate student.

Axten asked Assembly members

to consider who they would like to-

have chair the Cabinet since the
chairperson must be a voting

5 Assembly representative.

“‘We’ll need a new chairperson
soon because I'll be leaving Pitt at
the end of this term. Whoever will
take over as temporary chairperson
should get a briefing of what’s
happening to keep the chain of
information going until someone is
elected in the Fall,” said Axten.

“Most of the work I’ve done
involves getting along with the
administration, undergraduate
student government and the School
of General Studies student cabinet.

We get along well. These groups
are an enormous source of support
and potential publicity and they
help maintain contact with issues of
importance." _

Further by-laws revisions called
for each Assembly representative
to give an oral or written
description of the organizational
composition of the graduate stu-
dent body they represent and of the
procedure by which they were
selected.

Another by-law was revised to
provide the Assembly the right to
remove or refuse to seat a
representative on the grounds that
he has not been selected by the
graduate students of the school
they purport to represent. The
assembly may recommend to a
graduate student organization
representatives be recalled be-
cause of repeated absences from
Assembly meetings or failure to

fulﬁll their duties.

The Assembly will meet Thursday
to decide on proposed changes in
the by-laws. Revisions included a
rule opening all Assembly meet-
ings to any graduate student who
wishes to attend and another
specifying Cabinet members need
not be voting Assembly represen-
tatives.

The legitimacy of the 1973 vote by
Gallo farm workers to change
unions from the United Farm
Workers (UFW) to the Interna-
tional Brotherhood of Teamsters
was the main issue Friday
afternoon in a debate between the
Gallo Wine Industries and the
UFW.

Joshua Simon, Director of Educa-
tion and Communications for E.J.
Gallo Industries, represented the
winery and Frank Ortiz represen-
ted the UFW in the noon debate at
the Graduate School of Public
Health lecture hall.

The major conflict stems from a
change in the union representation

decisions by the dean and the ad

Other business included the
adoption of Academic Integrity
Codes for the Graduate Review
Board and the College, which were
passed; and a discussion of credit
for ROTC, which was tabled until
the next morning.

from the UFW to the Teamsters in
1973. That change led to friction
between the UFW and Gallo,
resulting in a nationwide boycott of
Gallo wines sponsored by the
UFW. “The non-violent boycott is
the only tool we have to achieve our
aims," contended Ortiz.

According to Ortiz,
workers were not given the
opportunity to officially vote before
the UFW was replaced by the
Teamsters. The 1973 vote at Gallo
was achieved through signature
cards signed by employees.

The Teamsters presented Gallo
with signature cards, which were
then to be checked by an
uninvolved third party. However,
Gallo Industries became the third
party, checked the signature cards
and acknowledged the Teamsters
as the union representing farm
workers at Gallo.

Though Gallo feels its actions
were legitimate, Ortiz and the
UFW contend they were not.
“Gallo hasn't even proven that
there has been a vote," Ortiz
commented.

Simon, however, maintained,
“Gallo acted in fairness and solely
in the best interest of the farm
workers,” when they acknowled-
ged the Teamsters as the repres-
enting union. Gallo further
asserted, “The UFW refused to
bargain about a new contract until
a week after the old one expired,
and then they refused to negotiate

problems with the community landlords.

on any of the issues.”

Ortiz felt the change of unions was
an infringement on workers’ rights.
“We the farm workers should be
allowed to determine for ourselves
what we want. We don't need
Gallo to tell us what we want. We
can protect ourselves."

The only way either side can see
an end to differences is a
secret-ballot election. “All Gallo
has to do is let us have an election
in the ranks and we'll call off the
boycott," Ortiz said.

Gallo also maintains it is in favor
of elections but that there have
been no procedures developed for
carrying out a secret
ballot election. Simon added,
“Gallo is in favor of elections as
long as the Teamsters and the
UFW agree to procedures.”

This basic lack of agreement on
secret-ballot elections continues to
keep Gallo and the UFW at odds.
As long as these discrepancies
continue, the UFW maintains it will
continue to promote the boycott of
Gallo products.

A Ultimate in Student Groups

BY BILL MOORE
A new student organization has
joined the ranks of the many Pitt
student groups on campus. Col-
lege Level Americans for Sexual
Promiscuity (CLASP) is, according

to CLASP chairperson Ben Dover, a I

group concerned with the increas-
ing morality on college campuses
and dedicated to increasing inci-

_dence of moral decay.

“We are hoping to return student
morals to the ’60s level when
everyone with any semblance of
sanity was participating in love-ins
and experiments in premarital
living arrangements,” Dover ex-
plained.

CLASP members engage in week-
ly “wrap sessions,” according to
Dover, where the students enclose
their bodies in Saran Wrap» and
parade through the Student Union.

“These wrapsessions are basic-
ally only to publicize our group,"
Dover confessed, “the real action
begins afterwards.” '

Dover said “no comment” when

asked to define the real action of

CLASP. He said certain archaic
state laws forbid various CLASP
activities and the group fears
prosecution.

Lynn A. Ment, one of three
women in CLASP, said she joined
the organization to overcome her
loneliness. “I’ve met the greatest
people in CLASP, and I’ve had a
real bang-up ofa time. In fact, just
the other day Ben (Dover) and I
went up to his room and we...oops,
I'm really not supposed to talk
about those things,” she said.

The group plans a major ‘_‘wrap
session" for sometime this spring.
“We’ve applied to the city for a
parade permit on Fifth Avenue and
we are planning to make this the
biggest thing on campus in years,”
Dover said.

The group’s other activities in-
clude weekly pornography sales in
the Towers lobby, field trips to
various‘ bars featuring strippers,

Letter to the  

Yellow Journalism

Charged in Story

To the Editor,

This letter is in regard to last
Friday's article, by Gene Grabow-
ski a_nd Irene Schmidt.

In reading Friday’s article, I ran
across an eye catching item...a
statement that Miss Schmidt and
_Mr. Grabowski claims that I stated
to them. As they both know, but
will not admit to this fact, I did not
make that statement to them. Mr.
Grabowski, in my conversation
with him on Friday, assured me
that he was “absolutely certain”
that he heard me state it‘to Miss
Schmidt.
made the statement to her was
Yakub. After Yakub’s telling Mr.
Grabowski that it was not my

- statement, but it was stated by

him, Mr. Grabowski then ans-
wered, “Well, I was not sure who
said it, but I knew it was said.”
While talking with Miss Schmidt,
Friday evening, she told me that

I . she ‘didn't remember exactly what,

was said, but it was I not Yakub,
who made the statement.‘ Then she
reassu_red me that Mr. Grabowski
had now remembered me making
Of course it
happened she said “I have it in my
notes." If indeed it was my
statement, why_ couldn't Mr.
Grabowski maintain that it was my
statement without Miss Schmidt,
as his backbone? Why would Miss
Schmidtget angry, when I told her

The individual, who. i

that it was Yakub's statement and
not mine?

My whole argument is that they
quoted a direct quote, that neither
of them ‘got from me. Since the
quote, was received by hearsay, it
should have been treated as
hearsay. '

Miss Schmidt contended that
maybe Yakub was trying to cover
up for me. Before she made this
statement, I was giving her the
benefit of the doubt that she had

some intelligence, now I can no.
longer give her that benefit. Iknow I

know that she doesn’t. If Yakub
was to retract my statement just to
cover up for me, then Yakub would
be defeating his own arguments of
“irregularities.” Without that
statement he would have no
defense, except himself. But
didn’t the statement seem to be
important to the- article by Mr.
Grabowski and Miss Schmidt?
Wouldn’t their article have been
less effective if, instead of using
the statement as a direct quote
from me, used it as something
Yakub allegedly heard from me?
Mr. Grabowski made a very
eloquent statement to me, in our
conversation, “we try and make
sure that our quotes are exact and
that we get to the truth”. But, Mr.
G. and Miss S. is it really the truth
you are looking: for, or an
interesting news story? I must
commend Mr. Grabowski on his
eloquent statements that he made,
but I believe t-hat the only one that
he fooled was himself. Both he and

.Miss Schmidt are suffering from a

severe case of “delusions of

and the infamous “clothes burn-
ings” in the Quad.

“I don't know why the others in
the group do it, but I do it for the
pure enjoyment of it,” said Ment,
presumably speaking of the clothes
burnings.

said he got the idea for the group
from last year's streaking rage.
“The students were saying some-
thing by all that nudity, y’know.
They were pleading for someone to
show them how to be sexually
promiscuous without being labelled’
‘wolves’ or ‘cheap women’ or
names likethose,” Dover said.

He blames “American prude pol-
iticians” and “religious party-
poopers” for instilling young peo-
ple with the belief that sex is
wrong. “I mean, after all, eating
gives you cavities and cigarettes
give you cancer, and drugs and

alcohol destroy your brain, but sex" “

doesn’t do anything but cheer you
up,” Dover said.

ditar  

grandeur”, They both feel that
they can rearrange the truth, in
order to make an interesting news
story. But the real shame of it all,
is that they‘ both convince
themselves that their “rearran-

ged" truths actually occurred.

Non-Objectivity

In response to the Pitt- News
article on Wednesday, March 19th,

 however, was dated Friday,

‘aw-~ :—‘

March 21, 1975, revealed little if
any accurate and objective analysis
of the candidated positions nor of
the internal structure of the Black
Action Society, if that, in fact was
the intention of Schmidt. ’

The biased and inaccurate article
clearly demonstrates the inability
of Pitt News to objectify conditions
and situation concerning the Black
student populus at the University
of Pittsburgh.

We are all aware of how difﬁcult it
is for individuals or “newspapers”
to be objective.”
student newspaper should try extra
:hard to avoid the type of total

”’§hbjectivity that Ms. Schmidt’s
article displayed.

As chairman of the Black Action
Society I offer several suggestions,
first, “young people” whom we
are, should ask questions about
the order of things and not to
formulate opinions that are-totally
subjective, secondly the Pitt News
should broaden its base for black
student input and participation by
whatever means “deem”

should ever, or continue to print or
describe the idiosyncrit nature of
Black people without thorough
background and information.

My appeal is to go beyond the
article and touch upon the agents of
change ‘‘'students.'’’ The year 1975
ﬁnds us “shocked" by the behavior
of America i.e., Watergate, Viet-
nam, Boston, Cambodia, Pitt

must reassess all conditionsfacing

students but of people in the entire
world. '

I’d like to thank all the Black

support of the Black Action Society
all year. I do hope this article
provoke a rage of consciousness on
your account to build and grow

Oldest Deception-

Cause of Disease

To The Editor:

It is disturbing to" note the recent
spate of racist outbursts in the
letters column of this paper. I
question the wisdom of the Pitt
News in printing such letters.
There has never been the freedom

  

of speech to shout “ﬁre” in a
crowded theater. America in 1975
is indeed a crowded theater, and
racism is a blowtorch.

However, I ﬁnd more distressing
the fundamental error in percep-
tion made by those who focus on
race as a root cause of social
pressure.

Imagine a hypothetical society
composed of three groups. Group
One, a very small minority;
controls the great bulk of wealth,
interlocking corporate power, and
political institutions. Group Two
makes up' 50 to 60% of the
population,
standard of living is dropping and
they fear.‘ unemployment and
economic insecurity, they still cling
to" some beneﬁts won over the
years. Group Three, about 30% of
the population, has in general been
systematically excluded even from
most beneﬁts available to Group

Two. Group One, knowing it is.

vastly outnumbered, must come up
with a method to protect its
vulnerable position. The age-old
technique is to set the other two
groups at each other’s throats, to
encourage them to see each other
as enemies. As long as both
succumb to this mutually destruc-
tive pattern, Group One remains

_secure in its inordinate wealth and

power.

‘ The tragic result appeared most

recently in South Boston. Working
class blacks and whites struggle for
access to already inadequate
educational resources, while the
children of corporate executives
attend posh private schools. Court

and though their:

ordered, integration is a beginning,
but it must not be conﬁned to

pitting blacks against working class

whites only.

At this time it is imperative that
the great majority of Americans
stress their working class and
economic similarities rather than
their differences in skin color.
Jesse Jackson has said, ‘‘I don’t
blame the white man for not
wanting the black to get his job.

And I don’t blame the black man,

for wanting to get that job. I want

to see a policy under which they.

both have jobs.”

It is time to analyze the root
causes of our economic disease
rather than lose ourselves in the
hideous symptom known as racism.
If I , as a white American, go
through my life thinking that the
black citizen is “one of them”
while Rockefeller is “one of us,”
then Iwill have fallen forthe oldest
deception -in history.

The issues in the dispute between
Gallo and the United Farm Work-
ers Union (UFW) are not as clear as
each side would lead the public to
believe. Each side maintains its
,own chronology and interpretation
of events. V
» Both sides agree farmworkers
should have the right to choose the
union they want for representation.
But Gallo says its workers rejected
the UF W in favor of the Teamsters
Union. ‘
‘If that is true, UFW argues, why
does Gallo refuse to hold secret-

 ballot elections to settle the issue of
which union the farmworkers
’> /Want?

And Gallo responds that elections
now would violate Gallo’s contract
‘with the Teamsters.

This latest problem for the UFW

. began in April 1973, when the

Gallo-UFW contract came up for
-renewal. [Gallo first signed a
contract with UFW in 1967 and
renewed it in 1970.] The April 18
deadline passed without an agree-
ment on a new contract and the

 UFW workers called for strike.

While the UF W picketed the Gallo

». vineyards in Modesto, California,

the-Teamsters collected and pre-
sented Gallo with signature cards

 indicating that Gallo’s farmworkers

 

wanted the Teamsters to represent
them. Signature cards are similar
to membership cards: they can be
used to show each worker’s choice
of union.

Gallo officials insist they veriﬁed
the Teamster signature cards, ef-
fectively breaking the UFW strike
by claiming their workers wanted
to change unions. If the workers
had chosen the Teamsters, Gallo
was no loner forced to negotiate
with the UFW.

Learning Skill center

Gives Classroom Help

BY GARY LAMPENFELD

Students seeking to improve their
study skills can turn to the
Learning Skill Center, located on
Schenley Hall's ﬁfth floor. The
Center offers learning-counseling
sessions; usually conducted in
groups; individual counseling; and
speed-reading instruction.

Learning Skill Coordinator Susan
Schiller said the Center does not
offer courses for credit, or conduct
classes in the usual sense.

Rather, she said, sessions are
conducted as wo1‘kshops,.and a
workshop series is offered each
term. ‘ Whether sessions are
conducted individually or in groups
depends onthe material and ‘skills
being covered. a " ' *

When’ an individual consults the

Center, he‘ is asked if he came‘ there
because of a particular class, and if
so, whether other students in that
class are having the same problem.

If " such is the case, group

counseling sessions can bear-

ranged, using material directly

from the course text.

The Center was instituted under
the University Counseling Center
in the fall of 1974, and offered to
conduct a student-faculty workshop
where students and faculty mem-
bers could have open discussions.
Schiller said she was “very
enthusiastic about the talking-with
-faculty workshop,” but regrets
there-was no turnout. “It would
seem as though there would be an
interest in that sort of thing, in

view of the large classes at'Pitt,” 

she said. ’

As for the test-taking practice
sessions offered by the center,
Schiller said she felt these could be '
of great value to persons who take .
tests infrequently. . “If you're not
in the habit of. test-taking,» the
practice of doing it isshelpful," she
said. ~ —

Since the Center's beginning last
fall, Schiller’s' staff has tried to let

near the work-out area, waiting for
gymnastic practice to end.
“Alright you guys, see you to-
” said lg Perez, a dark,
Handsome man with short black
hair. He stood out among the
shaggy-haired, baby-faced
gymnasts he coaches.

One by one, the .gymnasts quit
working out and walked off the
ﬂoor.

The boy changed his clothes in the
mat room and went over and
jumped onto the trampoline. His
mother sat on a wooden bench
watching her son, a miniature
version of the gymnasts on the
trampoline a few minutes ago.
Perez has been trying to get a
gymnasticsprogram started among
these Hill District kids, and so far it

saw! ‘Z3.-h_asn’t been easy.

A blackboy about 9 years old
walked across the gym ﬂoor. ’He
wore an oversized green. parka that

hung from his small, thin shoul-'
ders. Perez motioned for the boy to

come over to him.

“We'll try and start a team,” he
said, “you, Craig, Billy, Mike and
Shawn. How would you feel about
coming in about two nights a week
to practice? You’ll be on a team
and compete against other teams.”

The boy nodded.

“lt’s serious now. If you and
Craig start throwing pumpkin
seeds around, it’s not gonna go

lﬂ-wgyer big with me. Understand?”

The boy nodded again.

“OK. We’ll start out on the
trampoline."

The boy left Perez and the woman
and walked over to where Mike was
loosening up on the trampoline.

“Why is he staying late?” the
woman said, motioning toward a
guystanding near the trampoline,

“Well, Frank had a late class and
couldn't make it at 3:30," Perez
said. “And 1 think he feels he
could use the work-out."

Perez’ gymnasts practice three.
hours a day, six days a week all
year round, honing every muscle
for split-second response. Last
year Perez’ guys came back a week
early from Christmas vacation so
they would be ready for a meet.
And three of his men stayed in
Pittsburgh for the summer rather
than go home. They got jobs and
worked 8 hours and then came to
the gym every night from 7 to 10 to
practice.

“That's why I like to see kids
Mike's age start to learn gymnas-
tics," Perez said. There’s so much
to learn. My five all-around men
have to learn routines in six totally
different events," Perez said.
“There are as many as eight stages
to every part of every trick that's
mastered.” _

Perez’ team competes with other
colleges, and this year, for the first
time in ten years, it looks as though
he'll be able to enter a gynmast in

international competition--in this _

year's Pan American games.
Perez pointed to a guy wearing a
Mickey Mouse T-shirt over at the
trampoline, coaching the boys.
“He used to be captain of the
team 2 years ago, and has been
helping me out ever since he
graduated. He doesn’t get paid for
it," Perez said. “Pitt’s the only

, team in the Eastern League that

doesn’t have 2 full-time assistant
coaches."

 

He turned away from the woman
to look at Frank, who stood in an
area crammed with bars. rings and
a side horse. Frank walked in
stocking feet to a chalk bin, and
rubbed the drying chalk onto the
palms and fingers of his taped
hands. When he finished, his
hands were so white with chalk
dust and tapelit looked as though
he was wearing gloves.

“lg, will you spot me?” Frank
said, and ducked under a crisscross
of chains holding the. bars and
other apparatus to the floor. He
stood on a thick blue mat under a
thin metal bar.

The boy strapped a blue belt with
a large silver hook on each side
around his waist. A clothesline
rope attached to each hook ran up
to the ceiling, through pulleys, and
down again.

Perez walked over and held this
end of the rope. He wore gloves to
protect his hands from rope burns,
but Frank worked without protec-
tion. His hands were calloused and
peeling from constant rubbing
against the bars and rings. f

“Alright Frank, go ahead,” Perez
said, giving him his full attention.

Frank looked up and stared for a
moment at the chalk-covered-bar
three feet above him. He dropped
his head and stared straight ahead
in silent, solitary concentration.

Tensing his muscles, he looked up
again. He jumped, reaching for the
bar, and pressed himself against it,
straightening his body. He flipped
slowly around the bar a few times,
twisting the rope around it as he

turned. Perez pulled the rope,
taking up the slack.

Frank began the trick. Hooks and
pulleys jingled as he rotated, fully
extended, around the bar. The
rope unwound, disentangling it-
self.

Perez’ eyes bulged out and never
left the body turning and twisting
on the bar. He grasped the rope
tightly, readying for Frank’s dis-
mount.

the US. The UFW claims there is
no effective, enforceable national
legislation to protect migrant
workers.

The intellect, however, has be-
come the target of Gallo‘s appeal.
The Gallo winery sends a repre-
sentative around the country with
specific dates and documents re-
futing the UFW position point by
point. Gallo argues the real issue is
over who will represent the Gallo
farm workers--the Teamsters ‘or the
UFW. Yet Gallo did negotiate the
contract with the Teamsters while
UFW was on strike.

One point is clear: there is no
question an election among the
Gallo farmworkers would solve the
Gallo-UFW dispute. Nevertheless,
the Gallo-Teamster contract lasts
until 1977. The settlement of their
disagreement before then seems
unlikely.

Sinai Nlediation Failure
Expected to Unify Arabs

LONDON AP--U.S. officials
expect the breakdown of Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger's Sinai
mediation to unify the Arab states
in pressuring Israel to give up
war-captured territory on all fronts.

Egyptian President Anwar Sadat,

‘ upon whom Kissinger centered his

step-by-step approach to an ac-
commodation with Israel,*is likely
to seek new arms from the Soviet
Union--and get them, informants
disclosed. .

Kissinger is convinced that his
personal diplomacy, which earlier
produced two disengagement ac-
cords, is dead and that the
resumption of the Geneva peace
conference is inevitable.

Kissinger’s plane stopped here
for refueling Sunday on the way
back to Washington, and the
secretary spent 90 minutes brieﬁng
British Foreign Secretary James
Callaghan on his unsuccessful

lb-day mission."

The American informants said
Sadat's long-anticipated visit to the
United States undoubtedly will be
called off.

They added that Kissinger will not '

return to the Middle East unless he
is summoned by both sides--and
that is extremely unlikely.

The Geneva peace conference is
likely to resume in May, newsmen
were told on Kissinger’s homeward
ﬂight. .

They were also told Egypt and
Syria can be expected to resist
extension of the U.N. peacekeeping
forces set up last year. The U.N.
mandate in Sinai is due to expire at
the end of April, the force on the
Golan Heights at the end of May.

Support for Israel in the U.S.
Congress will slip a little, but not
enough to slow down the flow of
military and economic assistance,
the informants said.

Coryell’s Finest Album

BY DOUG GEBHARD

“The Restful Mind,” Larry

Coryell, Vanguard(VSD 79353)! ! ! !!
the

and performance at

This is unquestionably Coryell’s
finest album and one that should be
the album of the year. It is
ostensibly an acoustic guitar
exploration with members of the
group Oregon (Ralph Towner,
Collin Walcott and Glen Moore).
He does play electric guitar on two
numbers but it is, I think, his old
Gibson and not the new Hagstrom
...because of the full tone he

gﬁfeeeives.

This show at the Encore must
have been his way of reaching his
audience with the new material...
many who are unacquainted with
him would not have had the
exposure to some of his acoustic
pieces and the classical nature of
many of the older tunes he has

 ded.
gt.-.~;— commercial success of the

Eleventh House album brought-
Corylell to the front line in top
selling jazz lps with its easy
listenability and its appeal to the
“funky” audience, this lp sold to
the expanding jazz crowd.

What many hadn’t known. is that
he has been working with various
artists for many years and, I
believe, was the first to have the
itle “jazz-rock” stuck on him, with
'i:i’s"‘Lady Coryell (debut) album.

Coryell’s earlier works can be
heard on The Free Spirits lp,- which
hasbeen out of print since '68;
Herbie Mann’s Memphis Under-
ground; various Chico Hamilton
lp's; Gary Burton’s Lofty Fake
Anagram; and Live at Carnegie
Hall. After he left the Burton
quartet, he did the Lady Coryell
album, which is a mixture of

  
  
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 

 moving piece

 

classical, straight jazz, rock,
countryand ballads. Plus he tries
to sing...

Throughout his career Larry has
been associated with many genres
of jazz. One of his most notable
endeavors was Spaces with Chic

“ Corea, John McLaughlin, Miroslav

Vitous and Billy Cobham. It has
recently been reissued. The hype

_ hasn’t.detracted from the work.

This album contains two of his best
performances in “Wrong Is Right”

 (from the Burton days) and his best
.. tune ever,

“Rene’s Theme”...a
song on which he and McLaughlin
play acoustic guitar. It’s a fast
that has them
travelling the neck at incredible

speeds, and with such technical
' proﬁciency it’s astounding.

Coryell performed both of these
tunes at the Thursday evening
show, with his accompianistl Steve
Conn on second guitar. Their
playing was most assuredly the
best I’ve ever heard. I also will say
this was the best show I’ve ever
been to. I have travelled to Detroit

Corea’s “Spain.” It was close to

surpassed Corea’s. It was an

sequence, but things changed

when he played the Hagstrom.

primitive arts and crafts, simple
philosophies, energies directed to-
ward minimum survival.

Dispelling this idea, Achebe’s
works grew out of the social and
political evolution of Nigeria. He
describes British colonialism and
intercession in the recent Civil «War
(Biafra) in “He Loves Me, He
Loves Me Not,” a statement on the
differences between Britain’s
Prime Ministers Wilson and Heath.

He talks about “Public Executions
in Pictures,” and in “The Old Man
and the Census,” he claims Niger-
ians are very talented people
except when it comes to finding out
how many Nigerians _there are.

The essence of Achebe’s work is
his need to explain his native
country to the rest of the world and
his obligation to help bring about
the Nigerian revolution.

The evening was highlighted by
an award presentation to Achebe
from the Nigerian Student Union,
and ended with audience partici-
pation in a chant dedicated to a
fellow poet killed in the Nigerian
Civil War. '

familiar with Larry’s past, it is
worth noting he has taught at
Berkely School of Music and is
writing a book on music.

During “Low-Lee-Tah" he had
another accompianist, Eric Kloss .
on sax. It was incredib1e...I have'‘-’‘‘‘*
never seen anything like it. He
played on beautiful renditions of
“Rene’s Theme” and the ever
popular “Funky Waltz." What
happened next will go down in my
memory as the finest performance
by artist I've ever had the pleasure
of witnessing. George Jones was
added on Congas, Spider Rondelli
on percussion, and a gentleman
with whom I had the pleasure of
getting wasted played a wicked
gong and African bells...the tune
was “Memphis Underground”
and--believe me--it had the entire
place surging with rhythm. Icould
not believe it. The push of the tune“,
had Kloss and Coryell bending V"
melodies back and forth to a
breaking point.

What had begun as a quiet set
ended as a high energy jam
unparalleled in my perceptions. _
Coryell’s’ phrasing throughout the
gig was devastating. He hasastyle ' ‘
that plunges the notes into.the air
at times, ‘and a smooth river-like
quality to his runs that is so
incredibly quick one can't catch the
movements of his lanky ﬁngers.

This latest release is a juxtaposi-
tion of his other works because of
its totally acoustic and classical
nature...indeed quite a departure
from the Eleventh House endeavor.’
Its lyrical quality will please many
who enjoy ballads...f‘Song for Jim
Webb" is a notable tribute to
balladeers everywhere, and a
softer approach to straight jazz. He _
is the most important guitar player
since McLaughlin. In fact, as
Mahavishnu did, he studied under
Sri Chimnoy but left _him after a . _
short time. Mahavishnu hasended 
in a terrible sell-outto commercial-
ism with his last lp; Coryell hs
deepened my_ appreciation of the
guitar. It makes me wonder...what
ever happened to Bert Jansch,
Davey Graham and John Ren-
b0Um?' V I giveithe
album the highest grade on all
levels. He will evolve as the most
inﬂuential of guitarists when this
rock and roll quibbling is over.

a’Fe\ several photographs that
effectively produce images diffi-
cult, or impossible, to achieve with
a camera alone.

Keleti’s photographic style is very
different from that of her co-
exhibitor. She has photographed
such varied objects as statues in a
park, a delicate botanical specimen
with lacy feather-like ﬂowers that
almost seem to wave, and a human
ﬁgure, perhaps herself, in varying
poses. Her technique relies almost
exclusively on the camera and on
her ability to use it. She makes
excellent use of side- and back-
lighting to enhance the natural

hair escapingfrom the hairdo of a
woman practicing the .violin. Her
camera captures the pattern in
objects: .the inherent ruggedness of
a gnarled stump and the grain in
concrete Statues. . -

, Keleti’s most unusual picture is a
pair of hands holding something
not quite recognizable. The object-
has a hollow center, and the effect,
which really can’t be described, is
like falling into a vortex. It is as
close to three-dimensional as one
can get in photography. Keleti does
not use many darkroom tricks.

Sci-Fi Novel, Skip It

BY CAL RITCHEY

Ta, by John Robert‘—Russell,
Pocket Books, New York, April
1975 (sic) 207 pages, paper, $1.25.

It's theiold telepathic possession
trick once again, science ﬁction
fans. This time I Tanee, a
‘deformed’ (36-24-36) female
specimen from Ta who has‘ special
telepathic powers, brings one
Kenneth 0’Hara of New Yorktand
environs to Ta. O’Hara, known as
Kengee on Ta, is a sometime
soldier back home--a qualiﬁcation
that makes him an ideal candidate
to help the people of Ta.

Kengee{0’Hara’s brain is trans-
ported to‘ Ta and placed inside the
hulking ‘body of a ‘swordholder’
who is about to be executed for
malfeasance in office;‘ in other
words, he killed several people who
hadn’t needed to be killed.

To make a short story long, author
Russell arranges several layers of

telepathic possession, usually in-_

volving Tanee and other females.

All this possession--and remember,
this is not demonic possession, but
only mental possession--is de-
signed to help Kengee get to a
lower Ta and ﬁnd why the chief
mineral resource of Ta has -been
shut off by the barbarians of lower
Ta. The resource is a substance
with properties like ﬁberglass or

plastic, and it comes from 'l"akusa,_
a peculiar plant found only in lower
Ta. (Only in lower Ta until the end-
of the book’; when ‘Takusa pops up A‘
on upper Ta brieﬂy.) . , . ,

Why Takusa is only briefly in
evidence on upper Ta, and what the
plant really is and where it came
from, we won’t go into; Oh
yes--Tanee is considered ‘defor-
med’ because of certain physical
standards imposed on the women‘
of Ta.
\If you are really into science
ﬁction, this book might keep you
interested. Hang on through the
ﬁrst chapter; things pick up after
that. If you aren’t a dyed-in-the-y
wool sci-ﬁ nut, skip this one and go

A familiar face, a pre-season pick,
a torrid streak-snapper and a
“huh? How’d they get here?"
team have all made it to the NCAA
basketball championship tourney.

The semi’s will be next Saturday,
the finals Monday night, and both
will be in San Diego. '

The team no one expected to be
there is Syracuse, who beat Kansas
State 95-87 in overtime to win the
Eastern regionals at Providence.

Rudy Hackett, the Orange’s dom-
inating center, scored a buzzer
basket in regulation play, tying the
contest 76 all, seconds after K-
State's outstanding guard Chuckie
Williams seemingly had iced a
victory with a corner shot at :09.

The overtime was—anti-climactic,
as Syracuse blew the stunned
Wildcats off the court.

Orangement guards Jim Lee and
Jim >Wil1iams bucketed 11 points
between them, as their club out-
scored KSU 13-4 in the ﬁrst 2‘/2
minutes of overtime. Shortly after-
wards, Mike Evans, State’s scrapy
playmaker, fouledout, and Syra-
cuse coasted home. -

Kansas State led most of the game
on the strength of outside shooting
by Williams (35 points and the
tourney’s MVP), and Evans (20
points). _

However, the 6’9” Hackett
proved his worth, tallying 28 and
collecting 16 rebounds to keep his
team in the game. He totally
negated the play of State’s center
Carl Gerlach, who failed to score
and fouled out five minutes into the
second half. - 8

Syracuse will play the hottest
team in the nation, Mideast winner

Kentucky. The Wildcats snapped
Indiana’s 34 game winning streak
by upsetting the number one-
ranked Hoosiers, 92-90, at Dayton,
Ohio. , I

Led'by Mike Flynn’s 22 points;
Joe B. Hall's ‘Cats had balanced
scoring throughout their lineup.
Jimmy Dan Connor and Kevin
Grevey each had 17.

The mini-war at Dayton nearly
erupted twice, when ﬁghts broke
out at the beginning and the end of
the second half. Both were broken
up quickly.

Kentucky's key to victory was its
slaughter of the Hoosiers’ clinging
defense, a machine that had given
up only 65 points per game.

At halftime the score was tied at
_44, but the Wildcats scorched the
nets in the last 20 minutes by
hitting 57 percent of their shots,
including bombs from Connor and
Flynn. and acrobatic tips by a pair
of 6-10 freshmen centers, Mike
Phillips and Rick Robey. They each
finished with 10 points and each
fould out. Amazingly, they came
from different wombs.

Their inside play was oversha-

dowed by the invincible effort of ~

Indiana’s big man, Kent Benson.
His 33 points--and Steve Green’s
21--led the Hoosiers.

The expected help from Scott May
never came. Playing with an arm

broken exactly one month’ ago,

Indiana’s top scorer was ineffective
in the very physical game and
played only seven minutes, adding
one hoop.

Indiana twice came back from
deﬁcits during the last six minutes.
Down 79-70 and 89-81, the Ben-
son-paced Hoosiers rallied furious-
ly, but Kentucky held on.

Louisville made a lot of people at
Sports Illustrated happy. That

unheralded senior guard Phillip
Bond, scored in double ﬁgures.

guard Allen Murphy added 20.

, Dodgers Pick In

‘BY YAIER LEHRER

It is a well-known fact that
preseason predictions are always
inaccurate, meaningless and a
waste of valuable paper. This
article and the ones following it will
dispel that myth, for they will be
true prophecies concerning the
outcome of the 1975 major league
baseball season. ”

The Western Division will run as
follows; the Dodgers taking the
divisional crown and making it two
in a row for the National League
pennant.

WESTERN DIVISION

1. LOS ANGELES,DODGERS - '

The Dodgers have "made no earth-
shaking trades ‘in the ‘offseason,
except possibly for the acquisition
of former Giant pitching ace Juan
Marichal. The Dodgers not only
will win their division, but barring
any serious injury in their ranks,
they should take the pennant as
well. (Forgive me, Pirate fans).
Leading the explosive Dodger
attack are NL MVP Steve Garvey
(.312 average-21 home runs-111
runs batted in), Jimmy “Toy
Cannon” Wynn (.271-35-108),
Willie ‘ Crawford ’('.295-11-65)= v

   
   
 

and‘-

Bill Buckner (.314-7-58).

Buckner; Wynn and Crawford
combine for a tough hitting and
fine fielding outfield,’ although
Wynn’s arm has been known for its
distinct resemblance to a rubber
band. ,

Garvey leads the inﬁeld with Dave
Lopes, Bill Russell and All-Star
Ron Cey providing good_defense
and plenty of speed. Lopes stole 55

bases last season and was second ~

only to the amazin’ Lou Brock.
Russell, Wynn and Buckner also
are proﬁcient base stealers, as
Walt Alston keepshis team run-
ning at all times. ,
As if the Dodger offensive attack
is not enough, the pitching staff is
one of the best, if not the best, in
the league, with such.outstanding
starters as Don Sutton,_ Andy
Messersmith and Tommy John.
Sutton was the hottest pitcher
during the second half of last
season, winning’ his last thirteen
decisions. Messersmith managed a
20-6 record for the season, with a
2.59 ERA. Before he was injured,
southpaw ace Tommy John led the

, league with a 13-3 record and a

   

  

 

  

Bridgeman had 15 and 13, and
center Bill Bunton also had 13.

Bond played outstanding defense,
sticking to the Terp’s freshman
playmaker, Brad Davis, like a .._\.
leech. He limited Davis to only “n"\f'
seven shots and eight points, while
accounting for 24 of his team’s first
29. »

Up by five at the half, 42-37,,
Louisville came out pressing all
over the court, forcing Maryland
into a bushel of turnovers and
stifling the usually potent Terrapin
fast break.

At about 11 minutes in the second
half, Murphy gunned in four
straight baskets to put the Cards up
71-55. They slowly gave away the
lead via turnovers, as Maryland
crept back to within four, 82-78,
behind the keen eye of John-Lucas.
He led all scorers with 27 points. ,

Then Louisville stalled, with Bond
doing most of the ball-handling,
and forced Maryland to foul. The
Cards made good on 18 of 26 free
throws during the contest, to clinch
at -the win. 2- ‘ I

The victory gave Louisville Coach
Denny Drum another opportunity
to go against his mentor,_ John
Wooden. -The UCLA coach guided ‘
his. club to 89-75 cakewalk over
outclassed Arizona State in the
Western Regionals at Portland,
Oregon.

’ Marques Johnson led the Bruins ‘
with 35 points, a career high, while /
getting support from Richard .
Washington (16 points) and Dave
Meyers (11). ’

Johnson was the whole story. He
had numerous thefts and rebounds,
as his teameasily handled the Sun’

. Devils’ press after the first few

minutes.

Trailing ASU 19-18, the Bruins
reeled off ten straight points and 1
never again looked back. Neither, ‘Q;
Johnson nor Washington--both 8
sophomores--gave the Sun Devils 3.
break. They hit from everywhere.

Arizona State was. paced by Scott
Lloyd's 20 points.‘ Lionel Hollins
and Rudy White chipped in with
16 and 15, respectively.

So, Syracuse will try to upset its
fourth straight opponent Saturday.

out either “Iron Man”- Mike Mar-
shall or southpaw J im Brewer. The
relieving staff is the best in the’
league. Brewer [4-4, 2.54 ERA]
would be the number one reliever
on just about any other team,’ but
the awesome presence of Marshall

West that can make a realistic run

the sheer offensive power of the
“Big Red Machine” is awesome
and it is the Reds’ misfortune they
are in the Dodgers’ division.

Last season, the Reds had the
second best record in all of base-

the best record belonged to their ,
divisional rivals. ' *-

~ Beats
Friars

BY KEN RAPPOPORT
AP Sports Writer
NEW YORK AP —' Tim van
Blommensteyn "scored 23 points
and came off the bench in the

/ second half to ignite a Princeton

rally as the methodical Tigers
whipped Providence 80-69 Sunday
to become the ﬁrst Ivy League team
ever to win the National Invitation
Basketball Tournament.
’T he ﬂawless Ivy Leaguers had no
trouble with the Friars once they
got their style of game working
midway through the second half,_
sparked by their sharp-shooting
guard.

Van Blommensteyn scored 14
points as Princeton, playing a

- l_1_alf, took a 38-37 lead at the
Iliriitermission before a roaring Mad-

ison Square Garden crowd of more
than 14,000. '

But in the second half, the tough
Tigers reverted to the precision
type of ball that helped them win
their ﬁrst three games of this 38th
annual tournament. I

Despite his high first-half scoring
total, van Blommensteyn sat on the
bench for the first 10 minutes of the
second half. But when he finally
got back in, it was all over for
Providence.

Princeton’ held only a 54-51 lead
when reserve guard Pete Malloy hit
a field goal, then van Blommen-
steyn scored nine of his points as
the Tigers outscored the Friars 17-8
and accelerated to a 73-59 lead with
2:37 remaining. '

Princeton guard Mickey Steuerer
scored a game-high 26 points, most

of them in the late stages when the ,

Tigers had the title stashed away.
Providence, which had won the
NIT twice previously and finished

second another time, was led by _

Bello’s 22 points. Bruce Campbell
had 16 and Hassett finished with 13
for the Friars, who closed out their
season at 20-11.

The surprising Tigers, who lost the

Ivy League championship to Penn
this season, would up with a 22-8
record.

Dodgers Are Best Bet     I  

even won the division this season if
they could have wooed Dick Allen
to play in the fair city of Atlanta.
But this is not to be; the Braves ‘will
have to settle for third place the
second year in a row.

The pitching staff has finally‘

gelled for the Braves, with such
outstanding starters as Buzz Capra
and knuckleballer. Phil Niekro

ranked first and second in the‘

league in ERA last season.

There is also an abundance of
hitters on the Braves club. Chief
Nokahoma should be busy this
season with Darrel Evans, Dave
Johnson andIDusty Baker provid-
ing power while Ralph Garr chases
another National League batting
title with his consistent hitting.

4. SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS -
The Giants were a team on the
upswing last year, so Horace
Stoneham decided the team was
gettingtoo good. He traded away
his best player, ‘Bobby Bonds, for
Bobber Murcer. Murcer is no
slouch, either; but the Giants
definitely traded themselves out of
the Western Division race.

San, Francisco merits fourth place
not because they are so good, but
because the other two teams are so
bad. Not only did they trade away
Bonds, but they sold power hitter
Dave Kingman to the Mets. The
question is, what are the Giants left
with?

Well, there.’s an outfield of Mur-
cer, Gary Maddox and Gary Math-
ews, probably the best fielding
outfield in the division, although
their hitting is just short of anemic.
There was not one .300 hitter on
theentire Giant team last season.

With weak hitting, the Giants will
have to depend on their pitching,
which last season was lackluster at
best. Ron Bryant,‘a 24-12 pitcher in
1973, dropped to a horrendous
3-15. Probably the only bright spot
on the Giant staff was the coming
of age of left-handed Mike Cald-
well, who posted a 14-5 record,
with a 2.95 ERA. Last year’s
rookies, John D’Aquisto and John

 

Montefusco. came on fast and culd
reprieve the otherwise rubber-
armed San Francisco pitching staff.

5. HOUSTON ASTROS - The
Astros trading practices will event-
ually relegate the team to a minor
league status. In the past few
years. the Houston club has dealt
away superstars Joe Morgan and
Jim Wynn. In keeping with the
pattern they have set for them-
selves, they traded slugging ﬁrst
baseman Lee May for Enos Cabell,
an unknown from the Baltimore
organization.

Taking May's place at first base is
power hitter Bob Watson who,
while -being shufﬂed ‘constantly
from the outﬁeld to first base and
back again, hit .298, and could

adequately ﬁll the shoes of May. ‘

Having both May and Watson in
the lineup, however, would have
helped the Astros considerably.
The Astro pitching staff was
decimated by the "tragic death of
ace Don Wilson, whom the Astros
were confident would blossom into
a twenty game winner this season.
Remaining are Larry Dierker, Ken
Forsch, Mike Cosgrove and a host
of others, none of whom hurled a
complete game last season.

I It will be an interesting battle

between the Giants and Astros for
fourth and fifth places, with» an
outfield of Greg Gross, Cesar
Cedeno and Cabell trying to pull
the ailing Astros up by their
bootstraps. Cedeno and Gross are
proven quantities and should
emerge as team leaders. ‘

6. SAN DIEGO PADRES - The
Padres are probably the only team
in the Western Division who
wouldn't-ﬁnish in the top two or
three in the Eastern Division.

The Padres have been fodder for
the more powerful teams. Sixteen

Dodger victories last season came‘

over Ray Kroc’s team. A
Kroc is a whiz at hamburgers and
frenchifries, but should leave the
running of "a baseball team to
someone who ‘knows the business.

tion.

Palmer, still the game’s greatest
gate attraction despite the longest,
worst, most dismal slump of his
legendary career, twice held a
share of the lead in the ﬁnal round
but couldn’t keep it going. He blew
to an" agonizing 75 and was well
back at 284. _

It was the third time Palmer had
been within sight of victory this
year. It has escaped him every
time. On this occasion, he blew it
on consecutive bogeys on the sixth
and seventh holes--and lost any

chance at an with a double-bogey
six on the 13th.

Palmer, who took his last title in
the 1973 Bob Hope Desert Classic,
was in strong contention through
the ﬁrst three rounds of this event,
then advanced to a share of the

lead with birdies on the second and '

ﬁfth holes of the ﬁnal round.

But that was his last look in. It
only set the stage for another in an
exasperating series of bitter frus-
trations for the proud old champion
who seeks so desperately to recap-
ture the magic that’ was once his
alone.

(/Continued from Page 12)

Few people picked the Orangemen
to get past LaSalle, but they
squeaked past the Explorers. Ab-
solutely no one picked them to
upset ACC Champ North Carolina,
but Jim Lee’s last second basket
sent the Tar Heels home.

This past weekend, they were
content to let Kansas State domin-
ate their game, and relied on
Hackett's heriocs. They go so far,
but will no no further.

The best thing Kentucky has
going for it isthat it plays Syracuse
one week after its upset of Indiana.
That means it'll have a good bit of
time to ﬂoat down off the euphoric
piIIow.,

Kentucky has Robey and Phillips
inside to do battle with Hackett,
and it is doubtful it’ll _ be as
susceptible to Rudy’s moves as
KSU’s big men were. Furthermore,
because the two are so physical,
Hackett probably will feel like a
waffle if he survives their on-

. slaught.

Flynn and Conner work the back-
court possibly as well as any
tandem in college basketball. They
communicate. It wasn’t unusual
Saturday to see one of them crash
the boards while the other dropped
back to protect against the fast
break. Syracuse’s Lee is a sure

A shot, but‘ his mate, Jim Williams,

has to produce points in regulation
time instead of waiting for overtime
heroics. '

To add to Syracuse’s woes, the
Wildcats have an exceptional
bench. Bob Guyette is tossed in for
more bulk ‘underneath, and fresh-
man Jack Givens may be the
team’s ﬁnest shooter. And Larry
Jackson is a deft ball-handler who
can give Flynn or Connor a
breather.

An all-Kentucky ﬁnal? Uh-uh.

Often bad things.

About how big they

are. -They’ve been cursed in the
streets, reviled in Congress, con-

demned in the press. They are often.

overestimated. They are seldom
understood. -

We all should know them better,
for their handiwork is everywhere
—-though we may not realize it.

—They built a factory in a riot-
torn section of Watts, Ca1if., then
helped it along until it_was a $10-
million-a-year business owned large-.
ly by its employes. ’ ‘

M all should

know “them ” better, for they play
a vital role in every-

thing we do

—They helped to remodel a home
for troubled youngsters in Leaven-
worth, Kan., and to ﬁx up a recrea-
tion center for school dropouts and
drug victims in Dallas.

—They created a million new jobs
in the United States last year.

—They pour $325 million’ ‘into
education each year and another $144
million yearly into the arts. Their
total outlay for charity each year is
about $1 billion. '

—They put $85 million into a new
steel-making process that prevented
a steel mill in Pennsylvania from
closing down, saving 2000 jobs.

—-They give federal, state and_l0-
cal governments more than $41 bil-
lion in annual tax revenues.

Who are “they”?

Proﬁts. The money earned over
and above the expenses of operating
our American business and industry.
If industry were not proﬁtable, not
only would companies soon go out
of business—with dire consequences
to employes and st0ckholders—but a
great variety of social and humani-
tarian activities would simply go by

\

the board. It is a corp0rati0n’s con-
tinued proﬁtability that allows it to
regularly put money into, say, public

.TV or the local symphony, and at
the same time create new technology
and new jobs.

Proﬁts are not, as some people
seem to think, clutched in the hands
of a few cigar-smoking tycoons.
There are 30 million stockholders
in this country who count on them;
33.5 million workers whose retire-
ment funds, invested in stocks and
bonds, depend on them; 365 million
lifeinsurance policies in force in the
United States that depend to a great
degree on dividends that proﬁts
produce.

Proﬁts are far more, of course.
They are one of man’s primary
incentives. Long after factories have
been built and payrolls and fringe
beneﬁts paid, proﬁts keep lights
burning in ofﬁces, in laboratories, in
men’s minds, spurring the almost in-
deﬁnable mix of new products and
ideas called progress. Paper shufﬁers
and chart devisers in a centralized
economic bureaucracy do not invent
automatic transmissions, fresh-fro
zen foods, kidney machines, double-
knit fabrics or wonder drugs. Men
in the market-place do. Stimulated
by the prospect of proﬁt, they ﬁnd
harder steel, brighter color tele-
vision, sharper razor blades, quieter
air conditioners.

When millions wanted electric
hair-styler dryers, tremendous
amounts of money, planning and
machinery had to be channeled to

' :

0/JDVERTISEMENT

meet that demand by companies
seeking a proﬁt.‘ When the dryers
started rollingout, who beneﬁted?
The companies——sure. But the big
beneﬁciaries were the consumers,
ﬁrst, because their demands were
satisﬁed and, second, business com-
petition quickly drove prices down.
Yet, while proﬁts are so intimately
tied to the lives of all of us, the

public concept of them is so distorted ’

as to be hardly a concept at all. For
example, polls indicate that the ma-
jority of Americans believe business
clears about 28 cents proﬁt on every
dollar it earns. I

The fact is, after taxes the average
U.S. company now makes a little less
than a nickel proﬁt on each sales
dollar. , V V

Certainly, in some industries the
average is higher, but not very much.
Mining companies, oﬁﬁce-equipment
and computer ‘ ﬁrms average be-
tween nine and ten cents on the dol-
lar. Lumber products make around
seven. Oil production and reﬁning
produce about eight. But in many
industries the proﬁt margin is much

lower. Ironically, many of the low-

est proﬁt margins are in businesses
that many people assume to be mak-
ing “unconscionable proﬁts" at the
consumer’s expense. Supermarkets,
for instance, clear alittle less than
a penny on \each sales dollar. In
the retail-sales industry, the average
proﬁt per sales dollar is around two
cents.

Business and industry have tried

tir.ele_ssly_to convey this true. proﬁt j_-._

picture. But somehow we Ameri-
cans remain peculiarly unconvinced.
We buy a house for $28,000, sell it for
$40,000, then the next day condemn
someone else’s “pursuit of proﬁt.”
We blithely forget the realities, of
economics and competition.

might conclude she could make the
_ same dress for quite a ,bit less than
that amount. Provided she. could
get the pattern (one of hundreds

people in the garment industry ends
up fulﬁlling a consumer desire, pro-
viding livelihood for a department _
st0re’s employes, putting tax money
in the public treasury and proﬁting
the store’s owners. In the process, it
becomes a $50 dress. As for that $1.30

For to raise the proﬁt margin the
businessman would have to risk los-

Ali To Defend Crown

CLEVELAND AP--Muhammad
Ali, admittedly not in peak
condition, is a top-heavy favorite to
beat Chuck Wepner tonight and
retain the world heavyweight
championship he took from George
Foreman in Africa.

-—-’""e},li has said he has been better

.;_V/

prepared for fights but that he has
done enough to get ready for
Wepner. “I wouldn’t train like this
for George Foreman, Joe Frazier or
Ken Norton,” the champion said.
Professional odds-makers agree.
Nevada bookies didn’t even estab-
lish a betting line because Ali is
such a prohibitive favorite.
Norton has a role in the
closed-circuit television double-
header. The California heavy-
weight, who split two 12-round
ﬁghts with Ali, will meet Jerry
Quarry in a 12-rounder at New
Yorks Madison Square Garden.

 The title fight will follow the

ﬁmden match and begin about

10:30 pm, EDT, in the 22,000 seat
Coliseum, which lies between
Cleveland and Akron.

Ali is guaranteed $1.5 million for
the 48th ﬁght of a pro career that
began in 1960. He has won 45,32
by knockout, and lost twice. This
will be his 13th title ﬁght, but the
first since . he regained the
championship by beating Foreman.

Wepner, at 35 two years older
than Ali, is getting $100,000 for his
big chance. The liquor salesman
from Bayonne, N..I., has won 30
ﬁghts, 12 by knockout, against nine
losses and two draws. But seven of
the losses have been on cuts.

But Wepner and his manager, Al
Braverman, contend Chuck is a
different fighter since he had an
operation for the removal of scar
tissue about four years ago, that he
is no longer the “Bayonne
Bleeder.” '

Wepner has won his last eight
ﬁghts, the last three by knockout.

refuses to recognize the bout as a

Angelo Dundee, Ali's trainer, said
he is worried the 6’S" Wepner
might try to rough up Ali. If
Wepner does, said Dundee, “My

has said he will repay in kind.”

Ali I/s Wepner Fight; ii»,

Nat A Boxing Epic

BY RICK STOUFFER
Sports Editor

Chuck Wepner is a doormat and
Muhammad Ali is fat. That, my
friends, is about the size of the
so-called world heavyweight title
ﬁght tonight in the thriving boxing
comunity of Richﬁeld, Ohio.

Wepner is a throwback to the old
days of boxing--a time when an

‘exhibition was over only when

someone was out cold or dead.
There was no in between. At 6’5”
and 225 pounds, he is a slow,
lumbering fighter who takes pun-
ches as through they were vita-
mins. 4

Wepner’s, face, for example, has
been beaten and bloodies over 200
times during his somewhat dull
career. In one ﬁght against Sonny
Liston, his face needed over 120
stitches, which he took without the

’ aid of anesthesia. Constant pain is

something this man has learned to
live with. ’

Wepner now has won nine bouts

But look at the other side of the
coin. All, who was stunning against — ‘

Joe Frazier and against Ken Norton

Muhammed. He is in the worst

shape of his career--224 pounds of

Ali also is lacking the mental'*«_
attitude necessary for a champion 
Wepner, no" matter how 

ﬁghter.
hard he tries, is no Joe Frazier.
Why get up for‘a nothing?

Wepner is the tallest opponent Ali-
has fought in over ten years, which 
may cause the champ to punch up if . I
he wants to hit Chuck’s mush-face. V _
Punching up is tiring, regardless of" 

the shape a person is i_n. T ’

And so we have -it. The nobody

large marshmallow against a de-
fending champ who is a mass of

flab but who must fight to keep the '
promoters and fight-loving‘ folk. '

Ali should cakewalk, despite his
