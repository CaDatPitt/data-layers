Faculty salaries below
college average, gap
continues to widen

By Jennifer Calabrese
.‘ Senior Staﬁ‘ Writer

Despite a five-year plan adopted by a joint faculty—administrative
committee in 1986 to bring faculty salaries up to par with the median
salaries of the American Association of Universities, the gap between
Pitt professors’ salaries and the AAU medians increased by $100 from
1989 to 1990.

“Ideally each year [of the plan] the gap would have gotten smaller,
but that hasn’t been the case. The progress has been disappointing,”
said English professor Philip Wion, who serves on the University
Senate Budget Policies Committee.

The BPC presented the comparison between Pitt professors’
salaries and the AAU median at this month’s faculty—assembly
meeting, along with comparisons for associate and assistant professors.
The Pitt professor gap increased from $3,200 to $3,300 between the
school years of 1988-89 and 1989-90. Though the associate gap went
from $1,400 to $1,300 and the assistant gap from $1,700 to $1,600,
Wion said that those slight improvements aren’t nearly enough to
progress toward the goal of competitive salaries.

“The problem is that every other university gives salary increases
also. The task for the administration is to estimate what the other
universities are going to give and then to give us an additional
amount to close the gap,” Wion said.

Grad sped/eer stresses students’ role in world democracy

By Donna Terrell
For The Pitt News

said Palous “has worked ardently
and courageously for the causes
of political freedom and social
reform.”

Remembering the dark days of

Dr. Radim Palous, rector of
Charles University in Prague,

Czechoslovakia, and a leading
figure in the social- and political-
reform movements in that
country, stressed the roles of
students and universities in
helping to achieve and maintain
democracy throughout the world.

Palous’ speech, titled “The New
World Age: Observations on the
Events in Eastern Europe and
Their Global Impact,” was the
main address at the University of
Pittsburgh’s 168th

“Commencement Convocation on

April 28 at the Civic Arena.
Pitt President Wesley Posvar

totalitarian rule and working to
see that it never happens again
should be a priority among
students, said Palous. He called
the invitation to speak at Pitt’s
commencement an “approval of

new politics and a new
democratic state.”
The period prior to

Czechoslovakian independence
was very difficult for members of
the “illegal culture,” according to
Palous. “But,” he said, “I don't
want to forget lthatl it was very
important.” During a press
conference held before

graduation, Palous told of brave
students and university faculty
who risked their jobs and

education to help in the fight for

democracy.

Students were crucial to the
“illegal culture,” but Palous said
a majority of the political
opposition came from writers and
artists. During a time when a
majority of the Czechoslovakian
population was disillusioned and
-“against all politics,” Palous said
writers and artists helped him
publish and distribute books and
literature through the SAMIZDAT
-—— the illegal, independent press.

The illegal press was successful
in distributing Palous’ writings
as well as those of other dissidents
to foreign countries. Palous cites

this as proof of the dedication of
writers and artists. He said they
did not have computers or any
other electronic printing
techniques. They used old
typewriters; some were later
conﬁscated by the government.
Palous’ belief in students as
the backbone of reform stems
from the fact that he began his his
lifelong fight for democracy as a
student at Charles University. He

‘ was a member of an illegal student

movement during World War II.
In May of 1945 he participated in
the Prague revolution, which
expelled German occupation

‘forces from the Czech capital

city.
Following that, Palous became
involved with all aspects of

education. His involvement and
dedication to disseminating
information to all Czechs made
him the target of repeated
government arrests, interrogation
by the State Secret Service, and
led to brief periods of
imprisonment. During 1988,
the year Palous calls the “last full
year of political discrimination,”
he was imprisoned three times
and subjected to 11 police
interrogations. He said police
conﬁscated two typing machines
and 50 papers and articles. During

~ the late 1970s and throughout the

1980s, Palous held illegal seminars
in private apartments in Prague
and other cities. The seminars
focused on the philosophy of
education.

The campus organization
Concerned Leaders for
Environmental Action Now

recommends that the University
of Pittsburgh make improvements
in solid—waste management and
energy use.

An environmental audit
conducted by CLEAN reports that
Pitt landﬁlls an incredible amount
of used paper every day, and it
wastes energy and student money

_ by not using ﬂuorescent light
- bulbs.

“Pitt needs to recycle and buy

recycled paper,” said Jay Katz,

founder of the Student.Action
Union. “I’m only aware of one
recycling center on campus in
Forbes Quad, at the GSPIA bin,
but there aren’t any others. The
computer labs on campus waste

‘ an enormous amount of paper.”.

According to the audit,

recycling paper can reduce air
and water pollution by 50 percent.
Every ton of paper made from
recycled ﬁbers saves 7,000 gallons
of water and 4,100 kilowatt-hours
of electricity, in addition to 17
trees. The audit ‘reports that
keeping just a single ton of paper
out of a landfill would leave
space for all the trash a single
person generates in a year or
two.

In addition to the computer
labs, the audit cites the campus
book store and Central Printing

for offering virtually no recycled ’

paper products. The university
should create a policy to make a
percentage of its paper purchases
recycled paper, and individual
departments should also be
required to use a certain
percentage of recycled paper,
according to the audit.

The audit notes that the
university has begun a pilot
program in areas of Forbes Quad

to recycle white office paper, but
the program should be extended
throughout the university as soon

4 as possible.

The University Times, published
by University Relations, does not
print on recycled paper and
should seek a supplier that can
provide recycled paper, according
to the audit. In contrast, The Pitt
News, a student-run paper, prints
on 60: percent recycled paper, the
audit reported. ’

Seth Wenger, a spokesman for
CLEAN, said that paper waste is
not the only area that needs
improvement on campus.

“The university should switch
all the incandescent bulbs used
to ﬂuorescents,” said Wenger.
“Nowadays, you can buy 15-watt
compact fluorescent bulbs that
put out the same light as 60—watt
incandescent bulbs, and the
fluorescents last eight times as
long. The incandescents are a big

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Wednesday, May 9. 1990

waste of energy and money.”

The audit reports that‘ the
university can save energy and
money by installing reﬂectors
behind ﬂuorescent tubes already
in use, thereby reducing the
number of tubes needed at a
variety of locations on campus.
The university can also save
energy and money by installing
more timers on lights in
classrooms around campus. Many
classrooms remain unoccupied
for considerable periods of time
with the lights on, ac-cording to
the audit.

The audit suggests that the
university should plan and
implement a conservation
program in the near future. One
suggestion reported in the audit
would be to have a contest
between dormitories, sororities
or fraternities to see who can
reduce their energy consumption
the most relative to previous years.

Students innovate
to spend balance
of choice dollar$

By Mark Staf
Staff Writer

Robert Bellok still had more than $60 left on his choice dollars
ID on the last Thursday of the winter term. So the Pitt junior
bought about $20 in snack foods, such as potato chips, dip, ice
cream and pop at Schenley Cafe in an effort to get rid of his
credit.

- “I’m getting sick and fat from eating so much junk food," he
said. “Unfortunately my roommates all have choice dollars too,
and they are trying to get rid of [their credit]. You can only eat
so much chicken, and go to the cafeteria so many times.”

Bellok was one of the many students who participated in the
University of Pittsburgh’s Choice Dollars Program and found
themselves losing the money they had leftover at the end of the
term. 7
Choice dollars is an alternate meal plan in which students pay
a sum and receive equal credit on their student IDs. This money
can then be used to purchase meals at the Tower’s Cafeteria,
Lothrop Cafeteria, Schenley Cafe, Second Plate and Roy Rogers.

Budget crunch...
State may cancel PHEAA loans

By Kristene M. A. Bondl
For The Pitt News

The nonsubsidized loan of the
Pennsylvania Higher Education
Assistance Agency, which is
nearly 6 years old, is in danger of
becoming extinct this June.

A rarity in the United States,
this loan allows students to
borrow up to $8,000 during a
four—year college career while
paying interest on the loan. Bob
Heyl, senior assistant director of
Admissions and Financial Aid,
narrows the problem with the
program down to two
occurrences: First, “the program
has become more successful than
 anticipated,” and second, “the
funding is dwindling, and the
need is increasing.”

This is because during the past
eight years, the federal
government has changed the
criteria for ﬁnancial need for
college students. It is now virtually
impossible for a student to obtain
any federal aid if his family makes
more than $20,000 a year. The
PHEAA system is set up on low-
interest loans, which are basically
worthless in today’s stock market.
In recent time the funds for this
program have been raised
through the purchase of loans.

According to Heyl, the possible
loss of this loan will affect
approximately 25 percent of the
University of Pittsburgh’s students.
State colleges are claiming that
this will affect 50 percent of their
student body. Fortunately for
these students, there is hope for

this system. The state assembly
and the state senate both have
bills Currently before them to at
least temporarily salvage this form
of student aid. If PHEAA receives
ﬁnancial help from the state, it
will not be generated from taxes.
It will instead be the product of
state redistribution of the funds in
the education budget.

Even if PHEAA does not obtain
the help it is requesting, Heyl says
that students in need should not
have to worry too much. Though
PHEAA is a monopoly, it is not
the only loan available. According
to Heyl, if PHEAA unsubsidized
loans would cease to exist, “it
would be a chance for all these
other groups to market their loans
within the commonwealth.”

used to store books from the university

“The storage that we have is completely

said librarian Oxanna Kaufman, who is

preferably both, but as it's turned out, we
have not received enough information to
be able to judge whether either of these
projects is plausible for next year,” he said.

Benedek said that the building is in very
bad repair and needs a new roof and
windows, and that his committee cannot
plan the use of the storage facility unless
it is given the information it needs about
the state of the building and the cost of the
renovation.

William Roselle, director of the
university’s libraries, said that his plans
have also been delayed because of a lack
of information about the building.

“My staff and I spent the first term
reporting to the committee and relaying
our plans to occupy that facility to the
appropriate offices here at Pitt," Roselle
said.

THE P111‘ NEWS, Wednesday, May 9, 1990

“We have seen a variety of estimates
coming back, some ranging as high as $3.5
million, which I consider to be far too high
as we face a difficult budget year for Pitt.
We have to look at ways for that to be cut
back. [I’ve been told that] sometime this
spring we will get a ﬁnal budget estimate

and a proposal.”

Roselle said that he has introduced
discussion aboutlooking into an alternative
facility because of all the complications
with the Mine Safety Building. ,

“The Mine Safety Building is in disrepair;
would it not be possible to put up another
building closer to campus? I can assure
you that while we are all frustrated, I
would much rather have all of the
unanswered questions addressed before
we move a substantial portion of the
libraries’ holdings to a remote location
three miles from campus,” he said.

Professor Allen Janis, chairman of the
senate library committee two years ago,
said that during his term a new storage
facility was a great concern for the
committee.

“Representatives of the library committee
held meetings with the very highest levels
of administration in which we were assured
that, because of the horrible state of the
storage facilities, acquisition of a new
storage facility had absolutely the highest
priority,” he said.

“Now that was a long time ago — it
seems to me that now, with still no clear
concept of when the books can be removed

. what we were told was either not
entirely candid or else the planning that
went into it was disastrous. Either concept
leaves me really dismayed."

Choice

Continued from page 3

Even though most students who
use choice dollars approve of the
program, many were upset when
they realized that at the end of
the year they had money left over
that they could not get back.

Bellok is upset about the
program and believes that Choice
Dollars should either be extended
beyond the five places where it
can be used or should include
refunds for those who can not eat
$500 worth of cafeteria food a
year

“We should be able to get back
the money that we didn’t use,” he
said, “or at least get credit for next
yean"

Pitt sophomore and Roy Rogers’
employee Michelle Himes said
that in the ﬁnal week of the
winter term the restaurant had

_ been crushed with the‘ business

of students trying to get rid of
their choice dollars.

“We have sold more chicken in
the past couple days than I’ve
ever seen before,” she said. “I’ve
sold at least six or seven 16- or
20-piece [chicken packages] today
alone, all on student ID.

“This guy came in [to Roy
Rogers] on Tuesday and got
something on his ID, and he had
$292 left,” Himes said, adding
that she notified him that he had
this much left and that he had
only four more days to use it. “He
didn’t even know that. So he put
an order in for 300 pieces [of
chicken] to pick up today. He is
going to have a party.”

Himes claimed that normally
the majority of customers pay
with cash. She estimated that
about 20 customers out of 150
use the Choice Dollars Program.
“Today almost every order I have
done has been on Pitt ID,” she
said.

Furthermore, Himes said that
on Monday it was common to see

 
 

sums of $50 to $100 or more still
left on student IDs.

Himes has many stories of
students coming into the
restaurant and buying food for
groups of friends, Greek brothers
and sisters or for strangers in line
around them. “I said to a girl
today, ‘You want anything else?’
and she said, ‘Do you want
anything?”’

The Choice Dollars Program,
according to Mary H. Cacali,
associate director of housing and
food services, is set up to give
flexibility to on-campus students
who are required to have a meal
plan.

“It’s perfectly rational to get
tired of eating in the cafeteria
seven days a week. Students came
to us a few years ago and wanted
to have more ﬂexibility in what
they ate, when they ate and where
they ate. [We] came up with a
declining-balance plan to
supplement the meal plan.

“If you’re a resident student,
you are required to have some
meal plan. You can either take
one of the regular meal plans,
you can take a meal plan plus a
choice-dollar supplement, or if
you decide not to take any meal
plan, you have to take a minimum
$250 choice-dollar plan.”

Cacali notes that students
should have been aware of the
rules of the program and should
have been more organized with
their spending.

“Way before the term started,”
she said, “we told [students] what
they had to take and if you didn’t
use it by the end of April, you
would lose it. If there were some
people who didn’t spend [all their
choice dollars] then I'd say that
was their fault. They knew they
had to spend it by the end of the
year. We've been giving

suggestions all year long, and I
think students can think of

suggestions by themselves. I think
it might have been a matter of
poor planning on the part of the
students.”

Cacali notes that not much
credit was left on the choice
dollar accounts. “Most of the ones
who left money was under a
dollar, and if you take all the
choice-dollar plans that we sold
and the total amount that was left
at the end of the year, it comes to
an average of about $7 per
student.

“We called Roy Rogers and
said, ‘Be prepared, you’ll have a
lot of people coming in and
getting buckets of chicken.”’

Cacali notes that Pitt’s housing
department would lose money if
they had to reimburse students
for credit not used.

“We had to have a certain
amount of participation
guaranteed,” she said, “because
we had to buy all the equipment,
we had to run data lines, we have
to pay for keeping track of all this
 it’s an expensive program to
run, and we lose money on it, so
we had to know that there’s a
particular amount of participation.

You can't have a mandatory meal
plan if you are reimbursing
[students]. In order to somewhat
cover the costs of all the
equipment, what we have to buy
and all of the administrative costs,
we had to make some sort of
[mandatory] participation.”

Cacali notes that $250 a term
comes to $2.37 a day. “You can’t
even buy one meal a day with
that, no matter where you're going
to choose to eat. So it’s a bargain,”
she said.

Cacali said that any restaurant

would be allowed to join the
program if it purchased the
equipment and paid the costs to
run the program. Many restaurants
have not accepted the offer, she
said, because of the costs involved
to join the program. She said it
costs several thousand dollars for
the equipment alone, plus charges
for administration and to run and
install the data lines.

Although Pitt gives discounts
to Roy Rogers and other
university-affiliated restaurants, it
is willing to let any business into
the program that wants to join.
“We are talking to whoever’s

Time to ta/ee out the trash. ..

Spring is in the air, and summer is fast approaching. This
is- evident, not so much by the freshly planted ﬂowers and
trimmed grass or the tossing of Frisbees and footballs in
front of the Cathedral. At Pitt, the abundant trash that
students leave behind on lawns all over campus ushers in
the seasons?

Annually, Pitt students ﬂock to the lawns around the
Cathedral and the William Pitt ‘Union to enjoy the nice
weather and relax before and after finals week. This
tendency would present no problem if-the students would
only throw their trash away when they were finished. But
as Arthur Van Conklin, director of operations for Pitt's
facility management department, pointed out, “They
don’t always do that.” ‘

Van Conklin also said that the groundskeeping crew
might spend half a day, cleaning up the trash on the
Cathedral lawn on days when students leave a lot behind,

as opposed to a few hours on a typical day.

The problem, however, consists of more than a group

of students who haven’t learned, by the age of 18, to pick

up after themselves. Garbage cans outside university
buildings are frequently overﬂowing with trash. Al-
though, the students should, in those instances, be
expected to carry their trash with them and throw it away,
the administration could provide a much more conven-
ient and more effective solution. '

Undoubtedly the university should initiate a campus-
wide recycling project, which would not only get rid of
thetrash, but also save the university money, according
to the findings of the Concerned Leaders for Environ-
mental Action Now.

As members of the university community and the most
educated portion of the society, students and faculty have
a heightened responsibility to be conscious of the prob-
lems of our world. Our abuse of the environment is
among the greatest of these problems. When the'univer-
sity has at its disposal the means to elevate such a
problem, it has an obligation to do so.

The responsibility does not rest solely on the Pitt
administration, of course. It rests also on the shoulders of
students and student organizations. The Student Govern-
ment Board placed recycling cans in the concourse of the
student union. Perhaps the board could further extend
this project to the campus lawns. The university could
solicit similar cooperation from the SGB and other student
groups in recycling.

Since students do not seem compelled to discard their

own bottles, cans, napkins, paper dishes and newspa-

pers, and since the university stands to save money and
help to save the environment by recycling, the need for
a campus-wide recycling project is obvious.

Meat is murdering environment

The convenience of the fast-
food hamburger, fries and
milkshake is certainly enticing
for the fast-paced lifestyle of the
1990s. However, in the actual
time it takes to order and wait for
your food, over 100 acres of
tropical rain forests are destroyed
(150 acres per minute, 216,000
per day). Where vegetarianism
was once associated only with
an anachronistic “earth hippie”
persona, it has now become a
matter of planetary survival.

Because of the voracious meat-
centered appetite of America, 75
percent of original U.S. topsoil
has been lost (an average of one
acre every eight seconds). In
order to meet this high demand
for livestock, more land has had
to be utilized, and the deforesta-
tion of the tropical rain forests is
a direct result of this demand.

According to reports in the
New Yorle Times, raising cattle is
responsible for 80 percent of the
destruction of forest cover. In
1989, 518 million tons of car-
bonic acids were produced by
Amazon fires. The level of car-
bon dioxide atmospheric excess
holds the heat of the Earth in a
sort of thermal blanket, thus
producing the Greenhouse Ef-
fect, which has recently demon-
strated itself with worldwide
drought conditions.

Not only is cattle ranching
contributing significantly to global
warming, but it is also adding to
the number of starving people
on the planet. Approximately 1.3
billion human beings could be
fed on the grain and soybeans
consumed by US. livestock. Even
if Americans reduced their meat
intake by only 10 percent, 60
million people could adequately
be fed and survive.

Not only is the Amazon rain
forest the “world’s lungs” for
producing life-maintaining oxy-

gen, but the forests themselves
also hold many animals and
medicinal plants that cannot be
found anywhere else in the world.
The species extinction rate is 1,000
per year. For each hamburger, 55
square feet of these trees is lost.

Besides the obvious environ-
mental concerns with a meat-
centered diet, there are also health
concerns. Recently the FDA
approved certain levels of radia-
tion in chicken (to kill salmonella

 

Jessica
Coville

bacteria). Hormones are also
permitted to stimulate growth in
chicken and cattle.

In Central and South America,
there have been cases of girls at
the age of 5 beginning to grow
breasts and menstruate because
of the level of hormones they
ingest through meat. In the United
States, although the leve's of
hormones are regulated more
stringently, the risk of disease is
ever present, so the food is laced
with antibiotics. With the old
adage “you are what you eat,”
you are also what your food eats.
The antibiotics, hormones and
pesticides used in the meat in-
dustry are passed along directly

to your dinner table.

Of course there are also the
conditions of the industry. In
modern meat-packing houses,
birds are squeezed into cages so
small that they cannot walk
around or even stretch a wing.
The birds are also debeaked in a
painful process involving cutting
through sensitive tissue with a
hot knife. .

The veal industry is another
system that is unusually cruel.
Calves are strung up on har-
nesses and fed a diet that is
designed to produce anemic and
tender ﬂesh.

The fact that an anirﬁal cannot
vocalize pain with more than a
yelp does not mean that the pain
is any less stressful than that
which a human would experi-
ence being strung up in a sling
and fed only liquid devoid of any
protein. 0

For a culture brought up with
keen advertising that “beef is
good food,” and fast food is
wonderfully convenient, it is
difficult to convince the popu-
lace that the meat they are con-
suming is not only derived in a
painful manner but is also con-
tributing to the deterioration of
the planet's atmospheric condi-
tions. Meat is a moral and eco-
nomic concern that if ignored
could provide the ultimate de-
struction of our forest cover and
the life-sustaining oxygen that all
living things need.

So the next time you reach for
that quarter pounder in the styro-
foam container simply because it
is easier, think about what those
precious extra minutes making a
salad could mean for the rain
forests, animals and yourself.

I 'M.D. ' isn’t supposed to stand for 'Mz's-Diagnosis’

b

5!

Doctors don ‘t know everything.

Before this term, I always
thought they did. When a doctor
told me I had the flu or any other
common illness, I didn’t question
the diagnosis. Who does?

I learned differently during my
sophomore year at Pitt. Learning
not to take a doctor’s word for
granted is a valuable bit of infor-
mation — especially for some-
one who had tagged herself a
chronic hypochondriac.

It all started about two months
ago. I woke up one morning sick
— really sick. I had all the symp-
toms of a good old-fashioned
case of the flu —— chills, fever and
especially a sore throat. So I took
my validated Pitt ID over to the
Student Health Service, where I
saw a doctor who confirmed that
the ﬂu bug was going around and
I had definitely caught it. But just
to be on the safe side, the doctor
wanted to take a throat culture, in
case I had strep throat. I told the
doctor that I was taking an anti-

biotic for another infection, but
he assured me that would not
affect the culture results. Cool
enough. I went back to my suite,
crawled in bed, turned on “Days
of Our Lives" and waited to start
feeling better. .

In a few days, I found out the
strep test was negative, but I still
didn’t feel any better. So I waited
 and waited  and waited —
what was wrong? I trekked back
over to student health, where the
friendly physician again exam-
ined my very sore throat and told
me that it really wasn’t that red; I
probably just had a little viral
infection that was going around.
No big deal.

Four visits later, the doctor was
still telling me the same thing,
but to pacify me, he ordered
some prescriptions: one for si-
nuses, one for coughing and one
for cold symptoms. I knew his
secret diagnoses was hypochon-
dria, and soon I agreed with him.

After feeling like [crap] for more

than a month, I started to believe
my illness was psychosomatic-
that I was making myself sick

 

Jenifer
Crook

because of mental stress. So I
stopped complaining, but it still
didn’t get any better.

Every day the sore throat and

swollen glands persisted.

Last week, when I went home,

I decided to see my family physi-
cian. After all, he didn’t know I’d
been to the other doctor six
times in the last month. This
doctor attributed my problems
to grass allergies, gave me a big
shot in the butt — and another
throat culture. I explained to him
I had already had a culture done,
but he did not necessarily agree
with the Pitt doctor. The antibi-
otic I was taking at the time of my
first culture could interfere with

, the results.

Two days later, I found out that
I’ve been harboring strep throat
for two months. Granted, strep
isn’t very serious, but anyone
who’s had it knows how dragged
out it makes you feel. And if
strep is left untreated long
enough, it can cause serious heart

and other organ complications.

So there. I had strep throat. It

was that simple.

But I’m angry. I’m angry at the

doctor at student health for not
catching something so simple to
diagnose. I'm angry because for
two months, including finals
week, I felt unnecessarily awful.
And I’m especially angry at
myself, for being intimidated by
the M.D. title, and not seeing
another doctor sooner. I really
believed that doctors knew it all,
and that if an M.D. said that I
wasn’t really sick, then I wasn’t.
I can’t believe I thought that. I
should know better than anyone
how I'm feeling.

I’m not slamming on the Pitt
Student Health Service, because
I know that every physician
everywhere makes mistakes. The

real responsibility for our health .

falls on our own shoulders; we
all need to realize that four years
of medical school produces a
doctor, not a god.

The Pitt student voice is little more than a whisper

Pitt students do not have a
voice.

The administration makes the
rules, and we accept them.

When a group of us disagrees
with the administration on a given
issue, sometimes we’ll complain.
I can’t say for certain what ad-
ministrators do when we com-
plain, but I have a feeling they
laugh.

Each group has its individual
concerns. Bisexual, Gay And
Lesbian Alliance would like to
see the Reserve Officers’ Train-
ing Corps removed from campus
for its discriminatory policy to-
ward homosexuals. The Black
Action Society would like to see
the university make an effort to
recruit more black faculty mem-
bers and students. The Student
Government Board would like
the administration to consult the
board on all matters that concern
students. The Pitt News would
like to see more than a handful of
journalism classes in the course
description booklet.

Why shouldn’t the university
laugh at our demands? We've
been asking for the same things

Let's

for years, and the administration
hasn't conceded anything.

None of us are in a position to
demand anything of the admini-
stration — though our tuition
money invented and continues
to support its authority. In fact,
we aren’t in a position to even
make a polite request and have
it taken seriously.

We’re the students. When our
university makes a decision, even
a poor one, we pick up the tab.
We have the right to refuse to
accept those decisions we dis-
agree with. And some organiza-
tions do stand up and say,s“we
won’t tolerate this.” But nothing
ever changes, and the admini-
stration always seems to win in
the end.

Why?

There is a reason for this situ-

ation.

Pitt student groups never stand ‘

behind oneanother. Even if we’re

asking for the same things, we

do it separately. Various student
organizations lobby the univer-
sity with their individual objec-
tions and requests, but we never
address the administration to-

How much longer can the Pi-
rates actually remain in Pittsburgh?

No matter what level of com-
petitive success the Pirates
achieve, they fail to achieve fi-
nancial success. This kind of
history does not make a success-
ful baseball organization. Nor
does it keep a team in one city
forever.

The people of Pittsburgh are
practically asking the powers that
be to move the team to another
city, a city that would truly appre-
ciate baseball and our team. The
Pirates need fan support in a big
way, and it has to start soon.

I Everyone‘ knows how Pitts-
burgh views its sports teams. That

gether as a group.

Instead, every major student
group on campus expends at
least some percentage of its
energy on mindless, petty bick-
ering with the others. Rather than

 

Mindy
Boifemmyer

cooperating on common con-
cerns, Pitt’s student groups di-
minish the importance of those
concerns with the emphasis we
place on fighting among our-

is, aside from the Steelers, Pitts-
burgh fans only attend the sport-
ing events of winning teams. Even
then, however, attendance is far
from staggeringly high. This is the
problem that most plagues the
Buccos.

Despite having won six World
Series and having a history that
dates back to the first World Se-
ries ever played, the Pirates have
not drawn large numbers of fans
in years. The spunky, exciting,
second—place team of 1988 did
bring in a record number of fans,
but even that was low compared
to most other major-league teams,
regardless of whether they were
more or less successful than the

selves.

Panther Prints ought to think
about renaming the “Student
Organizations" section of the
yearbook the “Brat Pack.”

In general, there isn’t anything
wrong with a small group of
people attempting to tackle prob-
lerns without outside help. Or-
ganizations with the same goals
can choose to work separately,
and this approach can conceiva-
bly work on a national, or even a
global scale. But it isn’t working
at Pitt.

There simply aren’t enough of
us in any one organization to
command the respect (or even
the attention) of the administra-
tion. It can easily ignore all our
individual gripes without anger-
ing a relatively large number of
students at once.

But if we agreed to work to-
gether on even one of these
requests, we could make it very

- difficult for the administration to

refuse. If we’d get together once
in awhile, we might make our
currently unheard voices a little
louder.

Perhaps it sounds like just

go see the Bucs...

Pirates could be sold because of low attendan

Pirates.

Then in 1989, when the Pirates
fell on hard times, the fans aban-
doned them, and attendance
dropped off significantly. This
year the team is back, and it is
hungry, perhaps even more
hungry than the team of two
years ago. Attendance, however,
is showing no great signs of
improving. ~

The people of Pittsburgh,
whether or not they are fans of
baseball and/or the Pirates, need
to back their team and go to
games. If they do not, the own-
ers of the Pirates, the cheap group
of CEOs of Pittsburgh compa-

another radical, unreasonable
idea. But it works for other col-
lege students on other campuses
— Berkeley, Wisconsin, Oberlin,
etc.

The women of Mills College,
for example, have taken over
buildings on campus to protest
their administration's decision to
make the school co-educational.
Because a substantial number of

students decided to stand together ’

against a common grievance, they
commanded the attention of their
administration. In fact, they have
commanded national attention.

Knowing that our administra-
tion isn’t listening to us as indi-
viduals, we are acting irresponsi-
bly when we choose to address
them individually. We have the
history of the university to dem-
onstrate that very little is being
accomplished this way.

If the students want to see
things change, then we’re going
to have to start using a much
bigger student voice to tell the
university what we want loudly
enough to make ourselves heard.

spective editor for The Pitt News.

nies, will eventually sell the team
to an owner in another city, a city
which values baseball, whether
the team is winning or losing.

Pittsburgh is going to lose the
Pirates someday if the attendance
for their games does not improve.
Besides, the present Pirate team
is a great one withnot only a lot
of talent but a lot of heart as well.
They are a real contender with a
very successful future ahead of
them. Pittsburgh is the home of

The Barbed Wire Dolls sexy, but not sex symbols

By Tim Azinger
Managing Editor

Girl A did this and then she
played that and then girl B left
for a while, but then she came
back, and then girl C started
playing this, and girl D was our
roadie for a while but then. 
That’s a summary of the history
of the Barbed Wire Dolls.
Somewhat confusing and vague,
but you get the idea. “Typical
girls,” as lead guitan'stTris Tunney
says.

Michelle Efremenko (mouth),
Yvonne Mance (bass), Robin
Corely (drums), Shawnna Biondo
(rhythm guitar) and Tris form the
core of the most recent version
ofthe band, which first began on
April 1, 1987 —— April Fools’ Day,
appropriately enough.

“It started by mistake when
other band members left
instruments [lying] around in our
basement,” says Yvonne. “Half
Life used to practice there, and
we were bored, so we picked
them up.

Yvonne giggles, “Tris and I
used to do aerobics to Rush, and
then we would pick up the
instruments and run around,
pretending like we were playing.
People have tried [to teach us to
play], but they’ve lost patience.”

Regardless of “formal” musical
training, the Dolls have made a
name for themselves in Pittsburgh
with their Go—Goish punk rock.
Success has come relatively easy

for them. One of their songs was
just released on a local
compilation, and a four—song EP
is to be released in June on the
Get Hip label.

But don’t let it be said that the
Dolls are getting by on looks
alone. They’ve been billed in
certain ads as the “Sexy” Barbed
Wire Dolls, and while they are
sexy, they don't see themselves
as sex symbols.

‘‘I don’t like it at all,” says
Yvonne, “because people should
come to see us because of our
music."

The Barbed Wire Dolls are the
epitome of giggly fun. They’re
girls in women’s bodies. Take for
example the following exchange
on the origin of the band’s name:

Shawnna: “Barbed WireD0lLs is
a really trashy, poorly made cult
classic.”

Tris: “It’s a porn movie. There’s
lesbians in it!”

Shawnna: “It’s kind of like a
porn movie, but it’s not like
up—close porn.”

Yvonne: “lt’s porn for the ‘SOS.
It shows bras and girls holding
whips. Girls’ playing with each
other’s hair.”

And then they all giggle
simultaneously as Yvonne runs
her ﬁngers through Tris’ hair. .

There are numerous reasons
why they play music, but enjoying
themselves is the most important
factor.

“All our boyfriends have been

Sweetie: an Australi_an oddity at the Fulton Theatre

By Dmitri Ragano

Entertainment Editor

Jane Campion’s Sweetie is a
disturbing little oddity. The
Australian film takes its title from
a fat, black—clad ex-mental patient
who makes no end of trouble for
her family.

The film begins with Sweetie’s
pretty, eccentric sister Kay (Karon
Colston) seducing a co—worker’s
fiance (Tom Lycon). Thirteen
months later, they are unhappily
married and Sweetie (Genevieve
Lemon) pays them a visit.

Sweetie is pursuing a show—biz
career with her cadaverous
personal manager Bob (Michael
Lake). The two of them terrorize
Kay and her husband like
skeletons in the closet brought to
life. Eventually, Sweetie’s parents
are brought in, alternately ﬁghting
and accommodating Sweetie. All
this leads to a jarring climax in
Sweetie’s childhood tree house.

Sweetiewas shown at last year’s
Cannes Film Festival and has
become a minor hit in the New
York art—house circuit, being
touted as “Blue Velvet Down
Under.” The film’s look — lush
colors, odd rhythms, obsessive

 

images —— and bizarre material‘,

Pitt ponders Division I membership proposals  

By Mike Rampa
Sports Editor

. A special NCAA committee recently
released suggestions to limit membership
in Division I, and Pitt’s athletic department
is in basic agreement with some of the
general proposals released by the special

‘ committee to review membership structure.

Some of the committee proposals
include:

—— Allowing 25 scholarships each for
men’s and women’s sports besides football
and basketball, or $250,000 allowance
each for men and women.

—— Non-football schools must, sponsor
seven men’s and seven women’s Division

I sports rather than six.

—- Teams other than football and
basketball, playing the minimum number
of games, must play all against Division 1.
Beyond the minimum requirement, half of
the remaining games must be played
against Division I opponents.

—— Schools would not be allowed to
compete in a lower division in football.

Pitt’s associate athletic director, W. Dean
Billick, L stressed that not enough
information has been forwarded to the
university for the athletic department to
begin discussing speciﬁc legislation, but
he offered the early opinions of the
department. :

“There are all kinds of proposals that

different committees have been working
on  involving everything from cutting
assistant coaches, to the scholarships, to
[limiting] seasons, to the time athletes
have to spend in practice,” Billick said.

“We’ve had input into a number -of
those, and we’ve gotten those
recommendations back, and Ed [Bozik]
has sent those to all our coaches for us to
discuss and for them to get input back in
to us. So we’re trying to formulate our own
ideas and suggestions and give those to
different groups.”

Pitt’s final ideas will go to groups such
as the Big East Conference and to the
conference commissioner. Eventually,
suggestions will be forwarded to the

University Athletic Committee, which will
be, charged with the responsibility of
making some recommendations.

After those formalities have taken place,
everything will be reviewed, and eventually
Pitt will come up with its decisions on the
actual vote to be taken at the NCAA
convention. However, the current situation
is far from its ﬁnal stages.

“Generally speaking, we are very much
supportive of the efforts to both limit the
amount of time that athletes have to spend
[in practice] and in a number of cost-
containment areas," Billick said.

i “We haven’t formed positions on any of
the suggestions. Personally, I know Dr.

...while men capture third at
'90 Big East Championships

By Scott Campbell
Assistant Sports Editor

While most of Pennsylvania’s
top runners were plodding
through the drizzle this past
Sunday in the Pittsburgh
Marathon, the Pitt men’s track
and ﬁeld team was nestled up in
northwestern Philadelphia for
the Big East Championships at
Villanova University.

The men’s team finished a
solid third at the meet with 108
points, behind Georgetown’s 1 S7
and Syracuse’s 143, but
comfortably ahead of Villanova
and Connecticut’s 68.

“We did about as well as we
could have done,” said men’s
track coachjohn Vasvary. “There
are always a couple little things
that you would like to do better,
but there were also a couple of
things that we did that we didn't
count on.” O‘

The Panthers captured four
ﬁrst—place finishes, including
Dave Moore’s 1:48. 18 in the 800-
meter run, which earned him

the Most Outstanding
Performance of . the
championships and qualiﬁed
him for the NCAA

Championships for the second
year in a row.

Moore was also part of the
winning 4x400 B relay team
(3:12.90), which also included
Elbert Ellis, Franz Jobson and
Chappale Burton.

Ellis and Darrin Gillaspie took
the other top honors in the 400
intermediate hurdle (51.06) and
high jump (6 feet 10 1/4 inches),
respectively.

Second—place finishes were
garnered by Mike Stratos in the
javelin (183.10), Paul Friedrich
in the steeplechase (9:30.98) and
Ellis in the 110 hurdles (13.99).
Stratos was the two-time
defending champion, and
Friedrich won the steeplechase
last year.

Other top Pitt scorers include:
Burton, third in the 400 (48.38)
and fourth in the 400 hurdles
(53.65); Brett Shields, fourth in

the 110 hurdles (14.38); Keith‘

Dowling, second in the 10,000;
Todd Walthall, sixth in the 110
hurdles (14.71); and the 4x100
relay team of Shields, E1lis,Jobson
and Neil Malobicky (42.10).

All qualiﬁed for the IC4A

Davidson questionable second

Yo! This is Mars Blaclemon,

main man, Kenny Davidson of
the Pittsburgh Steelers.

defensive lineman.
SHUTUP./IiM77?YYNG TOMAJCE
ASYEELERSCOMMERCLALISHUT
UPI!
Here’s Kenny scratching his
head again, wondering how he

ever became a second-round NFL ‘

draft pick. .
Here’s a group shot of Aaron
Jones, Daryl Sims and Keith Gary
— Hey, how’d this get in there?

Hottest question from
Steelerland: Is that last photo
complete?

The most unfair thing about
this Kenny Davidson thing is the
fact that one is apt to pass
judgement on the Pittsburgh
Steelers’ second—round draft

choice before ever actually seeing
him play a down of football. Just
out of bold curiosity, how many
of you remember ever seeing
Steve Largent snag aerials in
college? Or witnessing Lyle Alzado

Thomas
Danyluk

pummel quarterbacks as an

undergrad? Or watching Mark _
' Duper ﬂy past a cornerback

before he joined the Miami
Dolphins?

Then again, that sort of
‘argument wouldbe more suitable
for defending Pittsburgh's ﬁrst—
round selection, Eric Green. As

Largent toiled at Tulsa, Alzado
yanked face masks at Yankton,
and Duper duped defenders at
Northwestern Louisiana. .The
Steelers’ Eric Green, a true tight
end, played in relative anonymity
at Liberty College in Falwell, ah,
Lynchburg, Va.

So much for the small-school
impediment. It shows that one
can truly go from the smalls to the
bigs.

But say one started out big.
Does that automatically qualify
him for the bigs?

Absolutely not. Nebraska and
Oklahoma, two of the biggest of
the big, traditionally put out
players who have trouble in the
bigs, for whatever metaphysical
reason. Four-year starters at these

schools have been known to fail
miserably in the NFL.

Which leads us back to the
topic of Mars’ photo feature.
Davidson, you see, attended a
big school (Louisiana State). But
what separates him from his
second—round peers is that Kenny
rarely played in college.
Pittsburgh's eighth—round choice,
Karl Dunbar, happened to be a
roommate and fraternity brother
with Davidson at LSU. The curious
circumstance, however, is that
Dunbar started ahead of
Davidson. And before breaking
his foot midway through last
season, Dunbar led the Tigers
with four sacks and 44 tackles.
Dunbar also was a three-year

“ht

Football

-The Panthers ended spring
camp with the annual Blue-Gold
game. The Blue (the people who
should win) won 20-0 over the
Gold (the people who should
lose). The contest was very
intense for a game between
teammates, but for Panther
faithfuls, it was a good sign.

It even caused Coach Paul
Hackett to utter the famous words
of all coaches looking forward to
next year, “Our intensity was
there offensively and defensively,
but we're still a long way from
the team we need to be to beat
Ohio University.” For those of
you who forgot, the Panthers
play OU the first week of the
season at Pitt Stadium. If the
Panthers couldn’t beat Ohio
University right now, then they'll
need a lot more work than they'll
be able to get in summer camp at
Johnstown, Pa., come late July.

With all the wonders of head
coach Paul Hackett’s offense, the
score at the half was 0-0. It caused
Hackett to wonder, “Does the
coach of this team coach offense
or defense?”

The game stayed tight until
running back Jermaine Williams

' took over. Hackett said, “Williams
is the classic-I tailback. He really
showed me something tonight”
From what he showed in the
game, look for Williams to fit the

same role Adam Walker did last’

year. That is, resting Curvin
Richards.

Scott Kaplan is back after a
one-year hiatus to learn to kick
off artificial turf rather than the
kicking block. He got his chance
in this game because last year’s
starter Ed Frazier was not allowed
to practice due to academic
problems. Hackett said, “[FrazierI
won't lose his job without having
a chance to keep it. Kaplan
definitely made up ground, which
means we will have a battle come
camp.” Watch for incoming-
freshman kicker Ted
D’Alessandro to stick his foot in
the middle of that battle.

The outstanding players of the

camp went to quarterback Scott
Stark on offense and defensive
back Anthony Jaggers.
Hackett on Stark: “Scott has
made the maturing step [during]
camp. He has been a big
surprise. Unfortunately, he is a
senior. But with people gunning
for Alex [Van Pelt, the starting
QB], he may just get a chance.”
Hackett on Jaggers: “He and
Louis Riddick had great springs.
They have caused the entire
defensive intensity to go up.”
Hackett on the overall offense:
“The offense is young. Alex and
Scott are coming along well. We
have to handle the ball a little
better than we did tonight, but
that is what spring is for. With the
work we have done this spring,
we can go to Johnstown and
really zero in. Right now the
polish is not there."

0 The Steelers first-round
drafting of tight end Eric Green
was surprising until you realize
Joe Walton now runs the offense.
He loves the two-tight-end
offense, and I don't believe Mike
Mularkey with Terry O’Shea
would do the job. Another thing
about Green: I don't know about
you, but I can see Green holding
Louis Lipps off the ground
somewhat like Bennie
Cunningham did with Lynn
Swann after Super Bowl XIII. By
the way, Cunningham was a tight
end and a first-round draft choice.
Interesting.
Major League Baseball
-The team that was supposed
to knock the Oakland Athletics
off their perch atop the AL West
has instead taken a major step
toward being eliminated come
June. The Kansas City Royals
stand at 7-16 through Sunday, 10
1/2 games behind the A’s, who
seem to be in cruise control
already. Many of the experts who

winners Bret Saberhagen and
Mark Davis have shown nothing
of their performances of last
season.

Saberhagen is 1-2. It must be
because of the “every-other-year"

he will finish under .500. Davis,

opportunities to save. Last season,
he was successful in 44 out of 48
opportunities with the San Diego
Padres. Mark Gubicza is just as
bad with a 1-4 record.

This team is in dire need of
instant life, and in the world of
sports, that means either a major
trade or a firing of a manager. Do
you see Bo Jackson getting
traded? Me neither. Bye-,bye,’Mr.

0 Have you noticed what the

Baltimore Orioles have been
doing? First, they sign used-to-be
prospect Sam Horn, who again
showed signs of brilliance
opening day with two three-run
homers. He did not hit No. 3 until
just this past week. Then they
signed Brad Komrninsk and Greg
Walker. Again, former prospects
that couldn’t make it with anyone
else. Heck, Komminsk couldn’t
make it with the Atlanta Braves a
few years back when they were
worse than this year’s team. I
hope this team is not trying to
build a winner the way the
Pittsburgh Pirates did in the mid
'80s. Psst  it didn’t work.

0 Speaking of the Pirates, can
you believe it’ Neal Heaton is 5-
0 this year and is on a personal
10—game winning streak dating
back to July 21, 1989. Doug
Drabek has finally come out of
April with a winning record, S~1.
The bullpen is hitting on all
cylinders with the right-handed
trio of Bill Landrum, Ted Power
and the released Doug Bair having
a hard time keeping up with
lefties Scott Ruskin and Bob
Patterson fast starts. Bobby Bonilla
has found a home in right field.

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Wednesday, M837 9. 1990

 

By Sean Heilman
Staﬂ’ Writer

This past weekend's Pittsburgh
Marathon has truly become an
international event. Three of the
Top 5 men and four of the Top 5
women in Sunday’s race were
foreigners.

Ireland's Dick Hooper became
the second foreign man to win in
the six-year history of the race.
He finished with a time of 2: 1 5:49.

-Conceicao Ferreira won the race

in 2:30:34, only 44 seconds shy of
a course record for women.

Hooper and Ferreira did not‘

expect to be greeted by such an
enthusiastic crowd along the 26-
mile, 385-yard course. Hooper
gained support from the various
Irish communities along the
course by wearing his native
green. Ferreira, smiling virtually

' throughout the entire race, praised
' the crowd support. » .

“Everybody kept screaming and
screaming for me, and there were
lots of Portuguese people [along
the course]. It made me feel good, ”
Ferreira said through interpreter
Jaclyn LeBarton.-

Ferreira took an early lead and
was never challenged. She
shattered her previous personal

best time by more than two
minutes. The only possible
disruption was a spectator who
inadvertently ran into Ferreira as
she turned a corner at mile 22.

“It didn’t distract me,” Ferreira
said. “No problem.”

Ferreira’s only challengers
quickly fell behind early in the
race. Czechoslovakia’s Alena
Peterkova was the ﬁnal close
competitor, but she developed a
severe bloody nose four miles
into the race and dropped out by
mile 18.

West Germany’s Kerstin
Pressler finished second with a
time of 2:31 :35. Raila Burangulova
of the Soviet Union finished third
(2232259).

Burangulova finished her third
marathon in three months on
Sunday. She ﬁnished fourth at
Nagoya, Japan, March 4 with a
time of 2:35:50, and she won the
Soviet National Championship in
Kaliningrad April 22 with a time
of 2:32:20, which qualiﬁed her
for the Goodwill Games in Seattle
in August.

“They told me I was going to
run in Pittsburgh two days before

A the Soviet race,” she said through

interpreter Larisa Mason. “The

me to run in Pittsburgh. I really
didn’t want to run that many
marathons, but I would be in
trouble if I didn’t. I feel really
good that I can run that many
marathons.”

The men’s race was a bit more
dramatic. T anzania’s Agapius
Masong, who is working on a
master’s in health and physical
education at East Texas State,
jumped to a 1 50-yard lead by the
time the pack reached the ﬁve-
mile marker at the 16th Street
Bridge. -

Masong, a late entry in the
race, was able to hold onto the
30-40 second lead until mile 20,
when he started to develop a
pain in his left side. He dropped
out at mile 22.

“Nobody kept the pace up [early
in the racel,” said Masong. “I said
[to myself] ‘Let me try it.’
So etimes I looked back to see
if a yone was coming. It wasn’t
my Jintention to go fast. The pace
for myself was fine.”

Masong was not running at an
extraordinarily fast pace. He was
headed for about a 2:15-2:18
marathon time. But the hilly
course and humidity caught up
with him. ‘

“At 18 miles I hurt in my left _

side, and I just lost my
concentration. I dropped out

“I figured we’d come back,”
said John Tuttle of Douglasville,
Ga. “I should have let him self-
destruct on his own instead of
trying to gain on him. He never
gained on us. Most of the time
[when someone jumps to a huge
lead], they are going to crack.
When he wasn’t gaining on us, I
knew it was just a matter of time.”

Finland's Tom Ekblom took
over the lead at mile 20 with
Hooper and Tuttle following the
pace. Hooper took the lead from
Ekblom at mile 23.

“Our pace slowed down [when
Masong dropped backl,” said
Ekblom. “I just tried to return the
pace. But it was a little too early.
After a couple of miles I felt too
tired. I let them catch me, and
then I tried to run with them.”

Hooper and Tuttle ran next to
Ekblom. But Hooper went out in
front, and Tuttle was running out
of gas and couldn’t seem to keep
up the pace. Hooper looked
strong over the last five miles.

Hooper hung back early in the
race, conserving energy in very
humid conditions (97 percent).
He fought through the crowd
and was with the lead pack by
mile 20.

“I was going for the win,” said
Hooper. “[Tutt1e’s] goose was

“I am a front runner. I don't go

. Davidson

Continued from page 10
starter for LSU on the defensive
line.

Davidson, meanwhile, officially
started a grand total of four games
in his four years with the Tigers,
which, after applying some basic

3 principles of integral calculus,

averages to about one start per
season.

Actually, two of those starts
came during his sophomore year
on the offensive line, and the
other two happened this past
year on the defensive line, a fact
that Steeler coaches have to find
somewhat comforting.

Dunbar is listed at 6 feet 4
inches, 273 pounds, while
Davidson checks in at 6 feet 5
inches, 274 pounds, with short
arms — not exactly a quality you
want in a defensive end, the
position where Pittsburgh intends
to play Davidson.

I.et’s dip into the Steeler quote
blotter.

0 Pittsburgh head coach Chuck
Noll: “We saw [Davidson] do what
we're going to ask him to do [for
the Steelers] in the Senior Bowl,
and that’s rush the passer. He
couldn't play in the B-4 defense]
that LSU played, so they moved
him around a lot.  But at the
Senior Bowl, he was very
impressive at things that were

. different than what he had to do
0 at LSU. We searched long and

hard for the reason he didn’t play
there.”

-Pittsburgh Director of Pro
Personnel and Development Tom
Donahue: “Senior Bowl practices
are excellent practices because
you get a chance to see these
people go against what are
supposedly the best players in
the country. It’s conceivable

I during that week of practice that

somebody can really improve
their stock.”

oPittsburgh defensive-line
coach Joe Greene: “Frankly
speaking, I would say that based
on his past performances, maybe
[Davidson] should have been a
fourth- or fifth-rounder.”

By the way, those past‘

performances consist of 3 1 tackles

and two sacks in 1989 — most of
which came after Dunbar’s injury
— and 34 tackles for a career.

Well, isn’t it at least traditional
to select players based on the
concrete quantity known as past
performances, not on a single
Senior Bowl week workout?

Donahue: “Well, San Francisco
or Cleveland would have taken
him in the second round if we
hadn't.” Or so they say. Which
reminds me of a common segment
of the preschool learning process;

Mother: “Junior, why did you
stick your head into Mr.
Shalopowicz’s septic tank?"

Junior: “Cause Eggbert and

Wilbur dared me to, and they
said they would do it if I did.”

Mother: “Did they do it too?”

Junior: “No, they were too busy
laughing.” ‘

Mother: “If Eggbert and Wilbur
dared you to draft a no-name
back-up defensive lineman with
the 43rd pick of the draft, would
you do it?”

Junior: “Don't be stupid, Mom.
That's different”

Mother: “Oh, no it’s not. I hope
you learned your lesson.”

By the way, Cleveland and San
Francisco have each been in the
playoffs for the past five seasons,
while the 49ers are also the two-
time defending Super Bowl
champs. They can afford a draft-
day screw up. Rebuilding
Pittsburgh cannot. What the
Steelers need at this stage is
security, which Tim Ryan or
Dennis Brown or Mike Fox would
have had a better chance of
providing in the second round
than Mr. Davidson does. ‘

- Hey, this is one case where I
would love to be proven wrong.
Maybe Davidson will pan out
and become the next Alzado,
sacking the heck out of the league
for years to come. But then again.

Here’s my main man Kenny
Davidsonwatcbingtbegamewitb
bis fellow developmental squad
buddies at the Pittsburgh Sports
Garden.

Must be the shoes.

Bozik favors cutting down on the
amount 'of time an athlete has to
spend in preparation for the sport.
Also, we are in favor of limiting
practice times, and we would
probably be in favor of reducing
the number of scholarships in
some of the sports,” he added.
