Cabinet.

WASHINGTON AP—-Gov. Milton
Shapp said Thursday he is hopeful
he can avert a threatened gasoline
station shutdown in Pennsylvania,
but if he doesn’t, he said he will
order the National Guard out to
make fuel available for emer-
gencies.

Shapp told the Pemtsylvania
congressional delegation here
Thursday that he would meet with
Federal Energy Ofﬁce officials to
try to satisfy dealer demands.

He warned strikers not to harass
those who stay open.

The shutdown is being promoted
by the Pennsylvania Service Station
Dealers_ Association. which repre-
sents half of Pennsylvania’s l0.0()0
stations.

Tom Anderson, executive direc-
tor of the association, says virtually
all its members. will honor the
shutdown.

But the effects of that action may
be hard to gauge since the
association has most .of its
members in larger, urbanized

areas and many stations are closed

simply because they’ve run out of
335- .
Anderson says his stations will
close’ down at 6 pm and stay shut
“until the federal ostriches get
their heads out of the sand.”
Anderson says non—association
members will also join the action.
“We don’t make any attempts to
pressure anybody, but we’re sure a

us.

The association is asking for one
tenth of a cent for every one per
cent of allocation that a dealer’s
been cut; If. a dealer has his
allocation cut by 10 per cent, he
could pass a. penny increase on to
his customers.

 

Pitt's secondannual writers‘

Saturday. February 22 and 23, in

Centre Ave. Nightclub  

BY THOMAS P. CLOONAN ‘

The Pennsylvania Liquor Control
Board (LCB) has supported an
Oakland—Shadyside residents’ coa-
lition and blocked the opening of a
futuristic nightclub on Centre
Avenue at Neville Street. ‘

Fantastic Plastic, 4650 ‘Centre
Avenue, was denied transfer of a
liquor license application by an
LCB decision delivered Tuesday.
The negative decision was attri-
buted to irregularities in Fantastic
Plastic, Incorporated’s ownership,
funding, and ﬁling practices.

The city's Zoning Board of
Adjustment last month denied the
club ‘an occupancy permit and
revoked its previously-granted
building permit because of inade-
quate parking facilities and neigh-
borhood opposition. The corpora-
tion's officers appealed the Zoning
Board ruling in Common Pleas
Court. but Judge Zoran Popovich
has not yet delivered a ruling on
the appeal.

Whether or not Popovich will
continue with the case is not
known,but the LCB decision
virt_ually assures the club’s perma-
nent closing. Fantastic is not an
adjective likely to be used in
describing a club unable to serve
alcohol, the residents point out.

The club, a reconverted Kroger
supermarket with a new white
stone facade,-. was originally sche-

‘mated at over

duled to open last November.
Representing an investment esti-
$200,000, the
nightspot is the work of’ architect
Tom Jayson and his ﬁrm, Con-
dominium International, designers
of the Northside’s 2001 Club.
Residents claimed last fall the
area was already too congested and

extra parking was not available for .
the 300 persons the club was.

expected to hold. Residents were

Oil Crisis J

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY
Area medical care may fall victim
to the current oil squeeze because
of an impending shortage of

‘disposable plastic syringes and

other health-service items which
are made from oil-reﬁning deriva-
tives. '

Although reports vary, according
to companies producing ‘the inex-
pensive disposable units for insti-
tutional use, lack of materials will

create a shortage in the nmrket of -

plastic products in the next three
months. 

The wide-spread use of dispos-
able plastic items which come in
contact with patients began in the

‘Station Shutdown Threatened New House B”, Eases

 Student Loan Process

BYLEEMARKOVITZ

A House bill, eliminating the
need for middle and low income
families to submit a “needs
analysis” report to obtain federal
loans for higher education, has
been introduced by Congressman
James O'Hara (D--lVIich.).

At present, all families regard-
less of income, are required to
submit various forms showing their
need for the low interest federal
loans before receiving them.

Congressman Joseph Gaydos
[D--Pa.], a member of the House
Special Subcommittee on Educa-
tion and cosponsor of the bill, said
‘needs analysis’ frequently pre-
sents an inﬂated view of the middle
income family’s ﬁnancial condition.

Thus the ‘needs analysis’
disqualiﬁes many would-be student

recipients from receiving the

ﬁnancial help they need.

“For example,” Gaydos — ex-
plained, “a man earning $13,000 a
year and nearing the end of a 20
year mortgage on his home can cost
his child a student - loan and
possibly a college education.

“This is because the ‘needs
analysis’ report considers the
equity. built up in the home as part
of the family’s ﬁnances and
concludes that the family does not
need ﬁnancial help for college."

O’Hara’s bill would eliminate the
‘needs analysis’ requirement for all
families whose income is’ below
$20,000. However this would not
mean these families would auto-
matically obtain a federal education
loan upon request since there are
other grounds, besides the ‘needs

analysis’ report, upon which a

request may be refused.
The bill is presently in the House
Special Subcommittee on Educa-

EndongersHospito|s_

of the glass and stainless steel
equipment which had to be
sterilized before reuse.

VV1thout the plastic units, which
virtually eliminated cross-infection,
according to hospital sources,
institutions will have to return to
the older system, facing staff
problems and lack of equipment.

Concern ﬁrst surfaced over the
shortage in a special session of the
Senate Health Sub—Committee, in
which representatives of health
industries producing the plastic
units, testiﬁed conditions in the
plastics market would lead to
shortages if the government did -not
intervene.

“We have conducted a survey,”
said Craig, “and it pretty well"
substantiates that hospitals are

hinges on a shortage of plastic‘

Washington might find itself in a

The new chaimten of the Legal
Awareness Committee (LAC) and
of Freshman Fall Weekend were
approved at the Student Govern-
ment Board (SGB) meeting_wed-
nesday.

Tom Doman, elected by LAC
members in early February, was
ofﬁcially appointed by the Board,
who also named Buddy Kahn to
coordinate this year’s Freshman
Fall Weekend.

Legal Awareness, an SG com-
mittee, provides free legal advice

also wary of the club's alleged

Turning to their state repre-
sentative, Democrat Leonard L.
Martino, for help, they were
dismayed to learn Martino was
listed as an original incorporator of
the club. and his law ﬁrm was
handling the club’s litigation.
Martino immediately withdrew his
and his f1rm's involvement with the
club, and says he would prefer to
make no comment on the matter
now.

Anthony Capizzi, identiﬁed himself
as the club’s boss to visiting ﬁre
marshals.

“This is not a viable business, it
does not service the neighborhood,
and it creates countless problems
for us,” said Janet Schlesinger, a
neighborhood spokeswoman.

Mayor Peter Flaherty agreed, in
an interview with LCB inves-
tigators, expressing concern “over
the moral character and turpitude
of the alleged corporate officers
and directors," according to an
LCB report. i

The Zoning Board decision
states: “The Board believes that
the Fantastic [Plastic] enterprise, if
approved, would have a detri-
mental effect on the neighborhood.
Moreover, the Board must recog-
nize that the promoters of Fantastic
have been irregular, even irres-
ponsible, in the conduct of their
operation.”

The structure’s future is uncer-
tain, but several of the area’s
residents have suggested it would
make a great supermarket.

“The Committee," Doman said.
“is a mediation between the
student and the officer. It provides
a neutral ground where we can
satisfy both parties--the oft'1cer’s
side of upholding the law, and the
student's desire not to be arres-
ted."

Though Doman says LAC must
ftmction both within the University
and outside it, he stressed
improving the Committee’s work-
ing relations within the University
as the prime concern.

“Most of the arrests are made by
the Campus Police,” Doman noted,
reversing the trend of a year ago
when the LAC handled more arrest
cases, primarily narcotic ones
made by City police. VV1thin the
last year, Doman continued, #4
Police Station in Oakland has
decreased its number of under-
cover narcotic agents, transferring
these men to uniformed, beat
details.

“The trend (in arrests this year)
has been a non-narcotic type of
thing,” Doman said, adding
narcotics “was the big thing” a
year ago. “The police are realizing
a little bit of pot isn't such a big
deal. They’re not actively seeking

Consolidating and updating LAC
legal infom1ation, developing a
Judicial Board team with special
expertise in that area, and printing
infomtational student handouts,
such as what to do when arrested,
are also part of Doman’s plans for
the coming year.

Noting the Committee is a law
school training ground for many
members, Doman also plans to
increase the educational aspect of
the organization. “I think people
on this Committee should know
how to do some kind of legal
research, and should also know the
rules of evidence," he said. He
plans training seminars to attain
this goal.

But once the LAC has strength-
ened its position within the
University, -Doman would like to
better LAC’s relationship with
outside agencies, including the
City police, magistrates-—who han-
dle arraignments for most arrests,
and local bondsmen.

In other business Wednesday,
the Board approved Campus
Qusade for Christ and Third
World People’s Coalition. Board
opinion split on the latter group,
with a vote of 3-1 and 3
abstentions.

Board member Bruce Keeler
explained his abstention. “I didn’t
vote against them," Keeler noted,
“because they fulﬁlled all the
requirements (for a student organ-
ization)._ But I couldn't see a major
distinction between their activities
and those of the SDS and YSA.”

Keeler vowed earlier to abstain
on all recognition votes until the
Committee on Student Organ-
izations (CSO) by-laws are re-
viewed. The by-laws were
discussed Wednesday. and the
Board hopes to approve them next
week.

Paul Hertneky, who said he was '

the only SGB member to speak for
the Third World People’s Coalition,
felt the new group did differ from
SDS and YSA.“Third World
People’s Coalition is a group
concerned only with imperialism.”
He explained the new group
approves countries, including cap-
italist, which YSA and SDS
wouldn’t approve.

The Board tabled both recog-
nition of the Fellowship of
Christian Athletes and emergency
allocations for Heinz Chapel Choir
because no representatives of the
groups were present.

Glee Club‘ Finishes Tour; 2 Pill FClCUlly Members Die 

Looks to Future Concerts

BY DAN DEELY

The Men’s Glee Club returned
this week from their three—day
winter tour after traveling 1500
miles and giving 4 concerts.

The Club gave its ﬁrst concert at
Fairview High School near Erie,
Pa. Friday. Later that day they
performed at Lake Erie College
near Cleveland in Painsville, Ohio.
On Saturday they traveled to
Louisville, Kentucky and per-
formed at Spalding College. John
Carroll University hosted the ﬁnal

‘ concert Sunday at 7:30 pm.

Approximately 15 songs in six
languages ﬁlled the Club's pro-
gram. The “Pitt Tunes" a barber

shop octet, and “Country Wine”, .

the Glee Club folk group also
performed.

Director Lee V. Herrity said the
Club is considered the best college
choir in the nation, holding the
distinction of doing extensive
staging and choreography from
Broadway plays.

In past years the Club has
performed choreography and se-
lections from The Brotherhood of
Man, How to Succeed in Business,
and fromAFunnyThingHappened
on The Way to The Forum.

“I have certain standards I’d like
to keep,” Herrity said. “We
perform with contrast-—using music
from all countries, many works
from the Renaissance, and by
Schubert who wrote the best music
for men. *

“The main thing is having a
standard of excellence and self
discipline. ”

Glee Club president Mike
Schnitzler said, “There is no
organization at Pitt that can do so
much--travel so much--and be so
close to each other. We’re closer
than a fraternity and the rewards
make it worthwhile.

“I've been all over the country,
to places I’d never see otherwise.”

In April the Club is going to tour
New England for a week. May 3
and 4 they have accepted an
invitation to the Intercollegiate
Musical conference at Miami of
Ohio University.

LETTERI POLICY 

Jay Latterman, last year's IFC
president, acknowledges that black
fraternities were forced to join IFC,
and that “they have no real need
for IFC help.” But Lattemian
believes the groups can work
together with mutual beneﬁt. ,“It’s
going to take cooperation on both
parts. And it's going to take time.
These things don’t happen over-
night,” he said.

Iatterman thinks the distance
between white and black frater-
nities is not a standard case of
segregation. “It’s more like
separatism,” he said. “There are
innate differences in the black and
white fraternity structures. Blacks
put more emphasis on relevance,
service work, and loyalty to
fraternity brothers. White empha-
sis is on the social aspects of
fraternity life."

Agreeing that white and black
fraternity structures are widely
disparate, newly-elected IFC Pres-
ident Mark Vemallis said: “The
difference between the black and
white fraternities is based not on
racism, but on ignorance, ignor-
ance of each other’s system.”

Another ten minutes went by and .

the waitress took the order of the
three newly arrived persons.

When she walked past our table
one of use asked her: “Miss can I
talk with you a minute?” She
simple turned around, gave us a
dirty look, then smiled smugly and
walked away. We felt that we had

taken just about enough of her
-inconsideration so we decided to

leave. On our way out we stopped
to speak with the manager once
again. We told him what had
happened and that the waitress
was not considerate in the least.
His response was that she was just
a new girl and only human.

In our opinion, being human
involves being considerate to all
people be they Black or White, and
she certainly does not ﬁt this
characteristic. We are writing this
letter to notify all of the students at
the University that discrimination
is not being practiced against
Blacks alone. Our hope. is that all
of those who read this letter realize
that until all people treat each other
as equals we can never live
together without racial prejudices.
There must be a concerted effort
from both sides.

- Hodge believes:

  

 

Alpha Phi Alpha brother Calvin
Branch recalls his pledging process
as a concern for personal brother-
hood rather than fraternity pres-
tige. Alpha Phi President Glenn
“Black frater-
nities are realizing they must move
into the community to be effective.
We go into that community as black
brothers, not as Alpha Phis.”

Black Greek groups are less
likely than whites to choose an
established charity as a‘ service
proiect, instead offering direct
community aid like tutoring in
schools and prisons, or ‘adopting’ a
ghetto family. .

One black fraternity brother
explained it this way: “Things are
a lot different for us in the world.
We have an obligation to the
people that can't help themselves.
Our roots are in the community and
that is where we will have to
someday return.” . ‘

Even while the black and white
fraternities continue to operate in
different ways, fraternity leaders
believe they can operate together.
Group distrust, they’ve said, can
be most effectively fought on an

Pos de Vary

individual, rather than an organ-
izational, level. Though black and
white groups seldom contact each
other, one-to-one exchanges be-
tween blacks and whites has been a
most effective means of commun-
ication. “Sports seem to work best
in this area,” said Jay Lattemian.

Student Affairs’ new fraternity
and sorority liason, Dina Natali,
also feels that blacks will work best
with IFC in a more relaxed
atmosphere. “I can’t force people

‘to sit down with each other, and I

don’t think it is right to try,” she
said.

Natali says Pitt’s fraternity
system has been slow in welcoming
black participation, but that delib-
erate efforts to speed it up might do
more harm than good. “I can’t
believe this is 1974 and we still

have to talk about acceptance. Pitt

is deﬁnitely behind.”

Spring’s upcoming Greek Week
events were planned last year, and,
though it is too late to change those
plans, Natali and IFC ofﬁcers will
be examining response to the
various activities and watching for
areas that might be improved.

 

Watching with them will be lFC's
ﬁrst black ofﬁcer, Secretary Lyle
Wood.

WoodisnotsureIFCcanbeof
any use to blacks in conventional
fraternity matters, but the weight
of IFC’s name might open doors
that have been heretofore closed to
blacks because of suspicions about
black radicalism. This is partic-
-ularly" so in matters like negotiating
arrangements for social affairs at
country clubs and hotels, Wood
said.

“IFC’s effectiveness for blacks is
not as likely to succeed in strictly
social areas as it might in ﬁnancial
matters,” he said. He’d also like to
see IFC help secure better
counseling services for blacks, and
perhaps build an index center of
ﬁnancial ‘aid for disadvantaged
students.

“I think IFC has just begim to
deal with these problems in the
past year. Remember, two groups
can’t be forced to work together,”
Wood said.

“Just my being there is a start,”
he added.

Kingdom of Fees

BY TOM SMITH

Once upon a time in the area of
the world known as Steel, there
was a small kingdom named
Panthcrpittdom. _ ‘

Most of the citizens of Panther-
pittdom were peasants called
students (pronounced stew-dents).
In an age of turmoil they remained
obedient to their ruler, King Pos de
Var.

The King was very fair minded.

. He was always concerned about the

welfare of the students. King Pos
dc Var dedicated himself to
providing the basic necessities of
life for his subjects.

He was loved b_y his subjects.
They rcspectedjhim and Pos de Var
respected their intelligence.

One day while bicycling to his
castle (in Pantherpittdom this was
known as the Cathedral). the King
met three odd looking creatures of
malevolence.

They were magic knights ex-
pclled from the Kingdom of Fees.
One was called Sir Reed of
Registrator. Another was lmownas
Sir Richardson of Question Mark.
They were often referred to as Men
of Yes. However, they were led by
the ﬁercest source of malevolence
in the land, Sir Joe of Dumbton.

The King of Fees. Add-Drop.
expelled the three because of their
inability to patch holes. “They
must prove themselves in a holy
kingdom," said the King. “before
they can regain their esteemed
positions."

It was for this reason the mighty
magic knights of evil headed for
Pantheipittdom. Thev intended to
find holes to plug.

On the road they seized King Pas
de Var and cast a spell over him.
Then, all four headed for the
Cathedral of Pantherpittdom on a
mission to disrupt the common
lives of the students.

Sir Joe of Dumbton inﬂuenced
the King to appoint him in charge
of the operations of the kingdom.
He did this by claiming he could
reduce the amount of expenditures

by six per cent.

The magic knight depicted
himself as a warrior on a shining
white horse. He was saving
Pantheipittdom from ﬁnancial ru-
in. This was a mission fit for
Lancelot, himself.

However, Sir Joe had_ a devious
scheme up his sleeves. A six per
cent reduction created a hole in his
budget. If the evil knight patched
the hole, he could return to his
home in Fees. ’

He decided to plug the hole by
charging a fee for the students’
time schedules. VV1thout the time
schedules the students would be
unable to do their work.

But. the students did not take
this sitting down. They rebelled
against the evil authority of Sir Joe.
They attempted to save their King,
but Pos de Var was blinded by the

malevolence of the threemagic
knights from ‘Fees.

The students had to ﬁght on their
own. First. theyntook their battle to
the Council of Elder Senators.
Theirpetitions met with deaf ears.

This was not because the
students’ cause was unjust. but
rather because the Elder Senators
were actually deaf.

Naturally, Sir Joe won. this
battle and turned the Elder
Senators into vegetables. This was
not a major transformation, and it
was the ﬁrst indication the knight
was losing his evil power.

 Stone’s Weekly Featured

l.F. Stone’s Weekly Reader, a
movie narrated by Tom VV1cker of
The New York Times, will be
shown free of charge Monday night
February 25 in David Lawrence
Auditorium. ‘

The ﬁlm proﬁles an independent
journalist, I.F. Stone, and his
creation of the famous Washington

newsletter, I.F. Stone’s Weekly.”

 

Finally, the students took their
battle to the evil knight, himself.
At ﬁrst Sir Joe of Dumbton refused
to talk.

Because of the position of the
moon in the sky, Sir Joe began
losing his evil power. He was
forced to talk to the students‘
leaders.

Eventually, King Pos de Var was
relieved of the evil spell. He
decided to resolve the issure
within a week.

Sadly, the King reflected on the
situation. “All my life I have tried
to serve my subjects,” said the
King, “and I have always provided
for their needs. .

“l have never deprived them of
their rights as students. I have
been deceived by the three evil
knights. They have attempted to
take advantage of the good nature
of my students.

"I am to blame for this situation.
I will resolve this situation. On this
day I have issued a proclamation
stating no fee will be charged for
time schedules. I think."

But, King Pos de Var was still
too weak from the evil spell to take
decisive action. He was unable to
banish the three knights from
Pantherpittdom.

Though the students were
satisﬁed with the King's actions.
they feared the future deeds of the
knights - ﬁ‘om Fees. Sir Joe of
Dumbton and his Men of Yes.

 

Launched in 1953, Stone’s
Weekly ﬁrst distinguished itself
from other newspapers for its
biting opposition to McCarthyism,
which was then in its heyday.

For the next 19 years, Stone and
his. wife put out the Weekly
together, being both critical and
perceptive of the political arena in
Washington.

the United States had led many,

producers to export their material,

Craig speculated hospitals would
have to ﬁnd alternatives to plastic
items during the shortage, but the
shift to older methods of sterilizing
reusables would be slow, and in
some cases nearly impossible
among country hospitals.

Don Seigel, purchasing director
for the’ Hospital Council in
Pittsburgh, said area hospitals
were still trying to determine the

seriousness of the impending '

shortage. “Most of them,” Seigel
said, “have not decided what
they're going to do yet. I think the
shortages are about three months
away.”- .

’Iim Bitler, public relations man
for Presbyterian Hospital, said the
price of disposable units would go
up, but a shortage itself would not
pose a problem to Presbytei-ia1i’s‘
operations.

“The price will go up,” Bitler
said. “And there are a tremendous
amount of plastics in a hospital.”

Dorothy McConaghey, of the
Central Supply and Service at
Childrens’ Hospital said her
department was ready, if necessary
to shift -to use of sterilization
equipment and glass instruments.

“We have the facilities we’ve
alwayshad to handle sterilization, ”
she said. “I do not believe in
stockpiling—-it’s the worst way to"
handle a shortage of any kind.”

somewhat of a disappointment to
many. Though in some cases the
Faculty members are showing new
work, in most instances the
opening of the UP Gallery was a
second or perhaps third showing of
the same work previously shown in
past Faculty art exhibits, and the
point has been reached where one
knows exactly what sorts of things
to expect from most of the Faculty
members. Hopefully, though,
the Faculty will give us a
refreshing surprise next time
around, and_if not, then, perhaps
the UP Gallery will. The next

Jack “Murph the Surf" Murphy
accrued fame and reknown initially
for his 1964 robbery of New York's
American Museum of Natural
History. in which he appropriated
the fabled “Star of India" sapphire
and the Delong ruby. in addition to
2 diamonds. all valued at a net
worth of $410,000. From that
_juncture in his life. this man. whose
familiar eockiness and llamboyance
would lure as much attention as his
reputed crimes. became America's
"Pretty Boy Floyd" of the 196051

Murphy graduated from Mc-
Keesport High School in 1955,
where he excelled in both tennis
and the violin. He captured the
WPIAL singles tennis title the
same year, but refused to enter the
PIAA championships at Penn
State, preferring, instead, to dance
all night at the school’s senior
prom, according to his coach.

Though he spent only his senior
year at McKeesport after his
family's arrival from California, he
was awarded first violin chairin the
school’s orchestra. and string
quartet. He even garnered a
“superior” rating at the State
Forensic ﬁnals in York, Pa.

But upon graduation. he enrolled
at Pitt and lasted only six weeks

before vacating the campus for
Florida, where he disappeared for
the next nine years before
surfacing in New York City.

In January. l9o4. three men
forced their way into the penthouse
suite of actress Eva Gabor.
pistol-whipping her and C0llllS-
cating $25,000 in jewels. The trio
eluded police and succeeded in
preserving their identities while
they committed two more robberies
in the months preceding the
October Museum heist. Unknown
at the time. one of the men was
later identiﬁed by Gabor as Jack
“Murph the Surf" Murphy.

On October 29, 1964, news
flashed out of New York City that
three gunmen had entered the
Museum of Natural History and

pocketed the_ 563-carat “Star of

India” sapphire and the 100-carat
Delong ruby. Within days, the
police issued tentative identi-_
ﬁcations of the suspects, and the

name “Murph the Surf” splashed‘

across front pages everywhere.
Meanwhile, Murphy, Clark. and
Kuhn induced a 19-year old
secretary,‘ Janet Flockiewitz. to
transport the jewels from New York
to Florida. where the trio was
eventually arrested in January.

“Exorcist” Heads Oscar Nominations

BY DREW PORVAZNIK
Unsurprisingly, The Exorcist, a

‘ﬁlm about dernonaic possession,

clinched ten Academy Award
nominations including best picture
in the 46th annual Motion Picture
Academy Award nominations an-
nounced Tuesday. Also tied with
The Exorcist in nominations is the

comedy crime caper, The Sting.

The biggest surprise about this
year’s nominations is that Francois
.Truffaut’s Day For Night missed

', _ . the best picttne nomination. It was
 awarded best picture, best director

and best supporting actress by the
New York Film Critics Circle and
the National Society of Film Critics.

The reason for the Truffaut ﬁlm
being nominated only in the best
foreign language ﬁlm‘ category is

because of a new ruling in this

section. The new rule states that
no foreign movie may be nom-

A inated for any other category if it

has been shown in Los Angeles
County during the ﬁscal year which
starts on April 1. I can't ﬁgure out
the reasoning behind this rule.

Chances are some of them

The Exorcist, The Sting, American
Grafﬁti, A Touch of Class and Cries
and Whispers. Personally, I was
predicting The Exorcist, Day For
Night, Cries and Whispers, Amer-
ican Grafﬁti and The Way We
Were.

It should be noted that Cries And
Whispers was in the same
predicament last year that Day For
Night is in this time. In addition,

Cries And Whispers, nominated for T

ﬁve awards, will be shown on
campus thursday April 11 by the
Pangbom Film Society.

There were some good choices in
the best director category, which
included George Roy Gill [The
Sting], Igmar Bergman [Ories and
Whispers], Bernardo Bertolucci

.[Last Tango. in Paris], Wlliam

Friedkin [The Exorcist] and George

Lucas [American Graﬂiti].
Marlin Brando, last year’-s

winner, was renorninated for best

actor from Last Tango in Paris-

along with Jack Nicholson The Last
Detail], Robert Redford [The
Sting], Al Pacino [Serpico], and
Jack Lemmon for Save the Tiger,
which will be screened on campus

1965. Three days later, ﬁfteen of
the jewels were recovered in a
Miami bus station, including the
exquisite Star of India sapphire.

Then, in December of 1967, the
bodies of two California secretaries
were I found in Whiskey Creek
Canal, just outside of Ft. Lauder-
dale, Fla. , with concrete blocks tied
around their necks, clad in bikinis
and costume jewelry. The police
traced the murders to “Murph the
Surf” and a sidekick, Jack Grifﬁth,
who held a second-degree black
belt in darate.

The two women had been
suspects in a $500,000 securities
theft in Ios Angeles, and asource
later told the police Murphy had
“relieved”~ the women of the
money when they came to Florida.
When they reportedly threatened
to tell the police, “Murph the
Surf” allegedly disposed of them.

Murphy was arrested on the
premises of Olive Wofford. a
Miami Beach socialite, in the act of
supposedly robbing her. Police
apprehended him after he drove
through a second-story plate glass
window in his attempt to escape.

The former McKeesport resident
was convicted of first—degree
murder in the deaths of both
secretaries, Terry Rae Frank and

Annalia Mohn, on March 14, 1969,
but only after he had been judges
legally sane. He was given’
consecutive life sentences in a case
that was so widely followed the
presiding judge remarked, “Any-
body who hasn’t heard of ‘Murph
the Surf’ must live in a cave.”

In August, 1970, he was
convicted of armed robbery with
intent to kill in the Wofford case,
and the judge told the audience
that Murphy's convictions barred
him from “ever again being in a
free world with a law-abiding
society.“ .

Thus, “Murph the Surf’s” wave
crested ignominiously. Through-
out his arrests and trials during
those six years, the newspapers
milked each story to its full
potential. The headlines reflected
the enormous appeal of the
proceedings: “Murph the Surf
Makes the Scene,” “Murph loses
Cool in Miami Robbery,” “Here’,s
latest on Murphy, Pals,” ‘-‘Murph
Beached for Life--Again,” and
“Sanity Fight Surfs Again Over
Murph.” ,

VV1th a deﬁnite bid to the NCAA
tournament drawing ever closer,
the Pitt * Panthers dispelled all
rumors that they hadn’t beaten top
notch competition until they’d
played a big team by downing the
Temple Owls, 56-49, at Fitzgerald
Fieldhouse Wednesday night, set-
tlhg a new Pitt record for most
victories.

The Pride of Pennsylvania and
Prestige in the East was at stake
and, despite a poor shooting
performance by Billy Knight, the
Cats’ bench strength carried them
through a surging Temple threat
that took them into the ﬁnal
minutes of play before the game
was ﬁnally iced. '

Keith Starr in particular dis-
played the power Buzz Ridl
possesses behind his starting ﬁve
by scoring nine points, three in the

last two minutes of the game, but .

shots that completely changed the
game’s outlook.

Knight followed with a tre-
mendous stuﬂ on Baskerville as
Temple went to the basket with
Starr snaring the rebound. Ridl
promptly seized the opportunity to
call time out, regroup his forces
and insert a new strategy.

When the Cats put the ball back
into play with 3:42 left in the game,
they calmly sat on the ball to draw
the Owls out of their rigid zone
defense and kill the clock in the
meantime. A minute and 24
seconds passed before John Knieb
intentionally fouled Starr to force
the ball over.

Starr put one of two through the -

nets but the Owls came right back,
Dan Kasmer hitting a jumper from
the right corner to put Temple only
a point behind, 48-47, with just
under two minutes to play. Pitt
came back out in a stall and

 Host ‘C-MU Tomorrow

 Icers 0ut To Undo “Hex ’ ’

C3}?

BY BARI‘ MACK

Two years of frustrations will be
on the line tomorrow night, 7 pm,
at the Civic Arena when the Pitt
Hockey Club gets its ﬁnal regular
season crack at the league leading
Carnegie-Mellon- Tartans. Pitt
hasn't defeated C-MU since spring
of 1972 and if that isn’t enough to
motivate the Panther skaters, ﬁrst
place of the Western Pa. Inter-

collegiate Hockey Association

should.

That “hex” that the Tartans hold
on Pitt has seen their last ﬁve
encounters end in three C-MU
victories and a pair of ties, the
latest aiwild battle in the beginning
of February that saw the lead
change hands three times. But if
Pitt can break that jinx, a ﬁnal ﬁrst
place ﬁnish is almost a certainly
although mathematical possibilities
still would remain to tell otherwise.

Pitt’s domination of the re-
maining schools in the local circuit
has been devestating, while C-MU
has had to struggle to avoid tasting
defeat. The Tartans luck almost
ran out last Sunday when they had
to settle for a tie with Indiana. A
Pitt victory on Saturday would put
the Panthers just one point behind
the Tartans with a game in hand
still remaining.

Even with its ﬁnances sagging,
the Pitt Club annolmced yesterday
that a Student bus will be available
for transportation to and from the
Arena. 'Ihe bus will leave at 6:30
pm from the Fifth Avenue side of
the Student Union and a 25 cent
rotmdtripfarewillbechargesto
help defray the costs. 'Ihe bus will
depart after the Pitt-CMU contest.

Pitt coach Len ‘Barcawlo has an
advantage going into the game that

he-hasn’t had for the two previous
contests with the Tartans. For the
ﬁrst time the whole Pitt team will
be intact.

Duke Shaeffer is back after a ﬁve
game suspension and Barcawlo has
inserted the hard-shooting veteran
on the left wing spot of the third
line to add some depth to the
lineup. Team scoring leader Rick
Vernon, who missed the last tilt
with CMU, is back and has scored
seven goals in the last two games.
Vernon accounted for all four Pitt
redlighters when the Panthers
dropped their ﬁrst contest with the
Tartans back in December.

On defense Barcawlo will stay
with John Finney, Glenn Hyde,
KerryBrowne and Russ Stump, the
latter having scored three goals in

the last pair of games. Whether or

not Vernon .;_-ejolm Charly Hagins

Mickey Martin and Richards
went to the line as the Owls
continued their strategy to retain
possession but the duo combined to
put the ﬁnal Pitt four points on the
board and the icing on the cake.

Knight paced Pitt to a 28-20 ﬁrst
half lead but had his troubles in the
second stanza, sinking only one
shot. Temple held the lead for a
three minute span in the ﬁrst half
but fell behind when Knight, Hill
and Starr powered the Cats from a
three point deﬁcit to a 12 point lead
before Temple scored its last four
points of the period.

The Temple zone defense kept
the Panthers from working the ball
inside most of the night although
Buzz Ridl expressed satisfaction of
his team’s performance.

“I’m pleased with the way we
played against a big team, ” he said
after the game. “Their defense
was big and tight in the lane and if

remains to be seen. Greg Mlntz
will retain his spot if Barcawlo feels
that Vernon’s services will most
beneﬁt the Club on another line.

In goal, Barcawlo will go with

who hasn't been beaten or tied yet
this year. Lieberman will face
CMU for the ﬁrst time this season
but remembers that CMU jinx all
too well, having played against
them three times last year.

“When they (CMU) came off the
ice after that tie with Indiana,
Lieberman said, “One of them told
me‘well you’ve got your break
now.’ Well they gave it to us and
there’s no way we’re going to turn
them down."

last playoff berth, Duquesne will

-The Pitt wrestlers certainly have
their work cut out for them
tomorrow. ‘ The grapplers will
travel to University Park to take on
the undefeated Penn State Nittany
Lions. PSU currently boasts a
record of 9-0-1 with their lone tie
coming against Navy by an 18-18

many to be the best team in the
East which isn’t too surprising

when you look at their credentials. .

The Lions will send three

on John Fritz (12-1), last year’s

Suhey, 180-pound state champion,
will battle George Calcagnini.
Suhey holds only a 3-2 record,
coming to the squad late because of
football practices.

Pitt heavyweight Carl Roba will
also draw a tough opponent in
Charlie Getty, an All-American
offensive tackle on the undefeated
PSU football team. Getty, who was
drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs,
will bring a 5-0 mark into
tomorrow’s match. He ﬁnished

year but should be able to move up
in this year's championships.

George Bryant [6-0], who has

pinned his last two opponents, will
not be wrestling his old rival, Tom
Teagarden. These two wrestlers
staged some of the ﬁercest contests
in the history of PIAA wrestling,
and the rivalry continued when

they moved on to collegiate -

wrestling. However, Teagarden
has been injured so Bryant will go

up against freshman Kevin Wood- .

This will be the ﬁnal tune-up for

the Panthers before next week's -

EIWA tournament at the Naval
Academy. The Panthers will be

hard-pressed to pulloff an upset --

and will need to win some of the

early matches ‘in order to do so. In ”'

any event it will be a good
opportunity for the young Panthers
to gain some experience against a
team which is sure to pose the
toughest opposition in next week's
championships. -

 

 

 

BY RICK STOUFFER

After nearly a two week layoff. the
Pitt Tracksters are on the road
again traveling to the Ohio State
Invitational at Columbus.

Ohio State in many ways will be
like Michigan State was with many
of the same teams competing.
Most Big 10 schools and mid-
western schools will be competing
along with Tennessee and Ken-
tucky colleges.

It's experiment time for Coach
Jim Banner as many men have
already qualiﬁed for the Eastern
Championships (March first and
second). “We're giving some of
our boys the chance to compete in
different areas in order to qualify
for the Eastems,” Banner said.

“A guy like Chuck Mozingo [who
generally runs in the mile or two
mile relay] will get another chance
to qualify in the half mile.” Rick
Weaver, also a steady perfomier in
the 600 will also be competing in
the half mile along with Bob Moore

“We are also trying another
combination in the distance medley
relay and the two mile relay,”
Banner continued. “Each relay we
have run this year has had a weak
leg in it. We haven't gotten our
best people together yet.” What
will happen when they do get
together will be anyone's guess.

In the 60 yard hurdles, Banner is
now stocked with football players.
Besides Curtis Smith, David Spates
and Al Webster have come out and
are doing well.

“I'm very pleased with the
progress the two are making,”
Banner said. “They have great
potential but they are not yet in
shape. If they stay for the outdoor
season and team up with Billv Rea

in the 440, I’m sure they wouldn't
be touched by any competition.”

Competition should come from a
few select teams. Tennessee is
deﬁnitely coming and they should
be tough," Banner said. Ohio
State will be tough along with
Murray State and Kent State."

We like going to Ohio State. The
competition is tough and is much
like the Delaware Invitational
except it is much closer," Banner
continued. With gas as tight as it is
this point is more important than
last year.

Andre Harris, a top hurdler, has
been out since the Pitt Invitational
because of a hamstring injury, but
will be ready for OSU. “Andre will
be ready but a death in his family
may keep him from competing,”
Banner explained. I

Our guys have been progressing
throughout the year,” Banner
continued. Then laughing he
added. “We'll do our best."

The other teams had better
watch out.

Billy Rea won’t be going to Ohio
State with the rest of the team. He
is going to the National AAU
Championship at New York's
Madison Square Garden. “Billy is
going to New York because he isn't
getting the competition anywhere
else,” Banner explained.

He’s making a lot of mistakes in
his takeoff because no one is
pushing him,” Banner said. At the
garden Rea will get all the
competition he needs. Competing
with him will be Randy Williams
from USC who was the gold medal
winner at the 1972 Olympics.

Besides Williams, Arnie Robin-
son from the Army will be there.
He won the bronze medal in '72.

96-61 pasting rcceiveti :1 month ago
at Allegheny (‘onununitv College.

It was in‘.mediateI\' obvious that
Panther coach Fran Webster had
made changes in the Panther
strategy that was honored in that
lone loss (lowntown. Pitt pressed
after making ﬁeld goals and foul
shots. The double team traps were
praeticalI\‘ non-existent as the little
Panthers exhibited a “give no
ground" type man to man defense.

A much improved 6‘ 6” 2051

top junior college inside pivot men
in the East and Talbott gave away
Johnson‘s only
scores came from long outside
jumpers. It would be nice to see
Johnson ﬁlling a Pittsburgh uni-
form next winter.

Pitt and Allegheny traded outside
shots as both clubs played even
until Pitt took the lead 14-12 on a
Wayne Talbott jumper at 10:15
remaining in the first half. Frank
Boyd and Bob Havgood added their
scoring talent to move the Panther

lead to. 22-18, but a pair of
unanswered jumpers by the
Cougars‘ giant center knotted the
score at 22 all.

Bob Shrewsbury managed a pair
fast break field goals to give the
little Panthers a lead that they were
to lose moments later as Cougar
coach Bill Shea substituted fine

outside shooting, and Allegheny‘

went to the locker room with a
34-31 half time advantage.

Coach Webster thought that the
answers for a victory had been
found dtuing half time as his club
fought back to regain the lead on a _
Scott Nedrow jumper with 14:20
left in the contest; however, the
lead was traded several times until
the Coungars took command for
good with 7:16 remaining as
Cougar coach Shea replaced two
foul ridden starters. _

Pitt failed to take the ball to the
hole which could have forced a pair
of fould troubled Cougar shat = ’
shooters to leave the contest via
fouling out. Instead Pitt continued
to jump ﬁ'om the outside with little
success as the Cougars failed to
miss and moved out to a 71-62
advnatage with 2:10 to go.

It was at this point that the little
Panthers made a desperation bid
but lost their poise and took
redieulous outside shots and were
forced to make tackle type fouls in a
last ditch effort to beat the best JV
team in town.

formance of 59.3 was another Pitt
mark.

Upsetting a team that is
supposedl_v better than your‘s is
one of the best feelings an athlete
- could have. and the members of the
~ Pitt swini team nearlv walked away
from Trees Pool with that fccl_ing
on Wednesda_v night. but fell short
as the Kent State Golden Flashes
beat them. 61-52.
"This meet could have gone

t/"::lill1'(‘l‘ way.“ said the KSU coach.

"this team is three hundred per

’ cellt better than last year, but their

lack of depth in free-style is what
finally beat them."
The score was 54-52. goin_g into

the filial event, the 400-yard
free-style relay. and it was already
a forgone conclusion that Kent

State had won the meet. although a
Pitt victory in the ﬁnal race would

fell over seven seconds behind the

race alld the meet.

The Cats started the meet off
well by winning the 400-yard
medley relay by one second with
the team of Mark Wallace, John

Stultiago. The win put the
Panthers ahea_d by a score of 7-0,
but from then on the meet,
however close, belonged to Kent

Student Needs Ar-e Greatest And Consequnl
VVher-e Student Monies Should Se Spent.

In order to expedite the allocations of funds to student groups and activ-
ities, and to better serve the needs and wants of _the general student
body, the Student Government Board is asking for your opinion on how
the student activities fee should be distributed. Information gathered in
this survey will be used as guidelines for funding by Student Govern-
ment Board. '

The activities fee of $12 per term is paid by all full-time undergraduate
students. Approximately $300,000 is collected in activities fees per fis-
cal year. This money is distributed by Student Government for use by
student groups. Funds are allocated for such purposes as student pub-
lications, programming, representative groups, etc. Student Govern-
ment recognizes the fact that student priorities have changed over the
past few years, and this survey is an attempt to find out where.

The following is a percentage listing of where the activities fee monies
where spent in previous year:
