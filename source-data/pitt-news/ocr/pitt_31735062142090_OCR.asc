Register

With the engineers, dentists,
ichemistry specials andnurses regis-
tered, the accelerated summer terrn
started last week.

The tpre—two weeks and evening

a session will hold registration days
on the 13 and 15 of June respea- _
' tively. ,

Upperclass engineers enrolled in

full, there being approximately 200‘

juniors and 200 seniors. In addition
about 75 per cent of the sopho-
mores returned this summer. E. A.
Holbrook, dean of the School of En-
gineering and Mines, said that the
‘entire engineering faculty is on
hand.
An innovation in the curriculum
is the four and a half hour per
week compulsory physical drill.
Freshmen in the school of engi-
neering will begin classes June 29
and will stay for twelve weeks till
September 16. The rest of the en-
‘gineers who began last Friday will
{have a‘16 week term.

The sophomores, Juniors and
Seniors in the school of Dentistry
registered on the second of June.
The freshmen will enroll on the
25th.

_ The chemistry special students
burned out in full force for the
"Summer session, Dr. Alexander Sil-

_ Norman, head of the chemistry do-

partment announced.

“It is an indication of loyalty and
M7illingne.ss to ‘ cooperate with the
_'government,” Dr. Silverman stated.

The University’s cooperation‘
with the nursing schools of the
Monteiiore, Shadyside, and St.
Francis hospitals to assist in the
nursing education program in
Western Pennsylvania speed-up
began yesterday with the regis-
tration for the summer course.

Scholarship students from the
fﬁiree hospitals who registered will
spend the entire summer on the
campus taking pre-clinical courses,
ggie work carrying full credit at the
_ ~ niversity. These students will re-
turn to the hospital school of nurs-
ing from which they enrolled and
complete their nursing program.

The three hospital schools are
‘able to offer these scholarships for

C {the three year course through Fed-

‘oral aid.

Students interested in working
on the Pitt ‘News editorial staﬁ
can. be interviewed at 3:30 on
Friday in 825 Cathedral. . . .
The next issue of the News will
be Tuesday, June 16.

University Officials Clarify Band Race Poiic 

“A student is eligible for either
the University band or for the con-
foert band if he is qualiﬁed from the
standpoint of marching and musical
ability."

So states the report of the com-
mittee to investigate, the Univer-
sity band policy with regard to
the admission of colored students.
In elfect this means that now Ne-

’ groes, along with white students,
will be admitted into the Pitt
band—=if they are qualified.

The committee was appointed
late in April to investigate the band
race policy after it had been made
known that a University student,
Gharles Rickmond, was denied en-
trance into the band because he was
colored.

Selected by Vice-chancellor Ru-
fus H, Fitzgerald, the committee
oonsisted of Dean of the School of
Business Administration Vincent
,W. Lanfear, acting dean of men
Theodore W. Biddle, Col. Edward
Kelly, head of the University ROTC
regiment, professor of economics

“Asher W. Isaacs, and professor of

history Carroll Amundson.

ings, invited to its sessions Rick-

535 Students
Get Degrees
Second graduation exercises un-

der the accelerated program took
place on June 1 in the Soldiers’ and

Sailors’ Memorial hall, when .535"

students were graduated from the
University.

Dr. William R. Farmer, speaker;
at the exercises and chaplain of the

University, told students of the.

graduate and professional schools
that whatever the form of recon-
struction after the war, the pro-
fessional ideal “through which per-

sonality expresses itself in the ser-. .

vice of humanity” will be funda-
mental to a just and durable peace»:

Honorary degrees were present‘-
ed to Judge Alexander Marshall
Thompson, of Common - Pleas
Court, and Dr. E. A. Gilmore, dean
of the school of law.

Judge Thompson, former dean of
the Pitt School of law, received the
degree of Doctor of Laws, and Dr.
Gilmore, -present dean, former act-
ing governor general of the Philip-
pine Islands, and past president of
the University of Iowa, the degree
of Doctor of Civil Law.

Of the candidates for degrees,
263 were ‘from the Graduate School,
75, School of Dentistry; 73, School
of Medicine; 52, School of Phar-
macy; 24, School of Applied Social
Sciences; 25, Research Bureal of
Retail Training, and 14, School of
‘Law. 

Commencement for undergrad-_

neering, Mines, and Nursing, was

held on April 26, when 648 receiv-
ed degrees.

In addition to their diplomas,

and tactics.

the university which prohibits col-
ored students from playing in the

band,” it set the blame for Rick-

mond’s not being admitted into the
band onto a confusion and division
of responsibility on the part of cer-
tain band authorities.

When Rickmond applied for the
marching band last fall, the report
points out, the band was organized
into two units———one the marching
band and the other the University
concert band. Instead of being as-
signed into the regular band bat-

tery, as were other freshmen and‘

sophomore ROTC men who were ac-
cepted in the band, Rickmond was
assigned to a different battery.
This was solely a military rul-
ing. The band battery was then
completely under the jurisdiction
of the ROTC and its oﬂicers. The
report pointed out that the ROTC
oﬂicers and military department
have the power and authority to
assign a man to any battery, band
or otherwise, that they may wish.
And they still have this power.
But the band rules, as clariﬁed by
the report, now make it clear that
a man's inon—admission -into the
ROTC band (long regarded an “..n-
popular” duty by bandsmen be-
cause of extra drilling involved)
in no way disqualiﬁed him from

Engineers Must Take A
Physical Education Courses

Gompulsory physical education
for engineering students was under
way at Pitt Friday. Under the ‘di-
rection of Frank Carver and James
Hagan the physical education cours-
es will be given twice a week ‘an
hour and a quarter sessions. Only
advanced course ROTC engineers
are exempted from the course.
Freshmen and sophomores in the
basic ROTC course will receive one
hour a week.

Pitt’s engineering school is the
first in the country to undertake
compulsory physical education as
a means of improving the physi-
cal ﬁtness of its students. The
action was prompted by E. A. Hol-
brook, dean of the School of En-
gineering and Mines, and mem-
bers of the faculty who were
shocked by the number of stu-

versity band, which plays at football
games, pep rallies, takes, trips; and
the concert band which presents
concert performances in the spring
taking a week long concert tour.
The report of the committee
guaranteed that Rickmond could
play in the latter two groups. It
remains to be seen what action the
military department takes in ad-

mitting Negroes into the band bat-
I tery to perfect the set-up. '

The report) also pointed out that
theithree band system has been
evolving for some time, that band
authorities themselves felt the old
system cumbersome, too divided
as to authority and responsibility
for use.

This three-band system was put
into elfect last March 26, before the
Rickmond investigation came up.
But little was said about it, either
to the News or to many of the band
members themselves. Now, states

the report, -the policies and organ-

izational set-up of the hand must
be made clear to each applicant at
the time of his admission to the
band.

There is, however, one item in the.
report which may confuse followers
‘of the aﬁair. This isﬁh Article 2

With the creation of its newest “Reserve
. rps” plan, the Army Enlisted Re-serve Corps,
liegovernment tacitly says a lot of things to
,ot_ of people. - H g g ,
,First, it tells the schools what it wants and
Tpects fromi them. It’ wants men-skilled,
, ined, intelligent, thinking, developed in
‘ h body- and mind. It wants. men who can
« ld stronger bridges, tougher planes, more
iatiwerful guns than the enemy. '
It wants menwith vision. Men who can,
, ith reason and intelligence, help to “win the
H peace” by removing, as nearly as possible,
those causes which led" to this war. Causes
hich, when you uncover their roots, emanate
_ om man’s simple and basic desires—to live
peace and harmony and cooperation with
reedom from want. ; _ , 
It is the job of the schools to turn out men
n oecan help ‘build a world where we can do
 this. Engineering, chemistry, physics, lan-
ages, geography, economics, political science,
V chology and sociology. Men—masters in one
"these ﬁelds and realizing the whole neces-
‘y interplay of them all—this the world
 ds. Now.-- \   _
uch men come from the schools. But they
lust come from the schools faster, in ever in-
geasing numbers. ,And that’s’why we’re here
,w‘, and why you, the engineers and nurses,
dentists and chemists are here now. ,

The government says to the schools that it
" ants those of us who are serious and deter-
mined to prepare ourselves for a"? place in the
War elfort, to stay here until we’ve ﬁnished
such training. To back up that statement,
they’-ve set up’ the Army Enlisted Reserve
orps. » .

his Army Enlisted Reserve Corps isn’t like
«e other f‘reserve” corps pl-ans that the gov-
ment has set up. There’s no stiff physical;

an American university during war time.

For this war is going to require the most

it bstacles standing in the way of carrying out
that job-_—small, insigniﬁcant, time-killing

For the government plans to give members of
this deferred group periodic scholastic achieve-

if not, they shall be expelled from the Reserve

expulsion from such a deferred group will,

an immediate call to service. I

The Band Report . .
The committee to investigate the Pitt band
with regard to the admission of colored stu-
dents has met and submitted’ its report to vice-
chancellor Rufus H.'Fitzgerald. _ ‘i ' i ‘ . ' ,
They’ve s-u-mbitted a fair report. For in the
University administered marching band and
in the concert band, musicianship and not race
«shall decide whether a man’s ﬁt to play.
And in those two bands, the only ones under
University jurisdiction, any student,VNegro or
white, who qualiﬁes can get’ in. '
There still remains the ROTC band. The
ROTC band ‘is’ made up of 60 freshmen and
sophomores in ROTC, who possess musical
qualiﬁcations. The only way you can get into
the ‘ROTC band is to be assigned to it by the
military department. An-d the University has
absolutely nothing to say over how the military
department assigns its personnel. . ‘

And in the past the ROTC has banned Ne-
_ groes from the band.

However, we’d like to see the military de-
partment follow the University’s example in
denouncing race 'preju‘d_ic'e. For, under the new

» se-t-up, it is a lot easier for a man to get into
the, University marching and concert hands
if he is a ROTC bandsman.

Article 2, section B. of the committee’s re- A

port says that _in general, before you can get
into the marching or concert bands you either

haveto play, or have played in the ROTC band. I

The University administered bands will not
. discriminate aganst Negroes. _
' The ROTC band has not said what it will do.
But the University will have the last say.
They can‘and will, if the player warrants it,
make exceptions to the rule requiring ROTC
band membership. I
So, whether or not the ROTC band removes
its ban against Negro players (a circumstance
‘over which the University has no control)
colored students will, it is assured, take their
rightful place in line beside their white co-
musicians, playing their Alma Mater “as one
to thee.” _________

But the incident to end all inci-
dents as far as Pitt baseball coach {
Ralph Mitterling is conicerned, hap-
pened during the Army game. Mel

simple fly ball. There wereno ob-

Probably » the most original

method of judgingla track meet
was devised by Pitt’s Carl Olson.-
and the Army track coach Yea] .
Novak. When the meet between .
Pitt and Army was made-almost
impossible by 'a heavy rain Olson
and Novak got together, and de-
cided to score the match as it

used two methods: tossing a coin 1;
and time trials-

When Olson called the coin cor-
rectly he got a first place, Army 4
‘ta‘king‘..second and third, when No-
vak called it correctly Army got the A
first place. In, the time trial meth-
od the itwocoac-hes got t-ogether to
ﬁgure out by previous records what
each man would probably do and’
then awarded points accordingly.
But just the same Pitt lost, 75 to 51.

But let this be said of Pitt’s
spring sports, they may not have
been good, but they were never
dull.»

JVIAVAL OFFICERS DEMONSTRATING SEX_TAN"|"_ TO ‘MATH CLASS

O Because of the urgent need for men well-trained
 mathematics in our army, xﬁwy, and air—force,
i'_ ,-itt has been offering intensive courses in algebra,

ﬁrigonometry, and navigation.

  

4 The four-Weeks’ course in algebra and trigonom-
‘ltry and the six-weeks’ course in navigation are spe-
bially designed for men about to enter the armed
A ' rces and for those already in them. ,
New ‘algebra and ‘trigonometry classes will start

‘ mer session -and will probably be given in August
and September, according to Dr. James S. Taylor,

gpmofessor -of matlemotics. These

ﬁcrsity. -

Since the initial air raid drill held
ﬁere May 13 came off “much better
3 an we could possibly have hoped,”

i ,. Geise is optimistic about the
gbntire situation.

During the ﬁrst drill, there wits
no ﬂoor that took longer than six
minutes to be cleared entirely. The
iwerage clearing time was only
slightly more than two minutes.
Tlhe whole drill was completed 22

Wbounded to announce the “raid.”

Every classroom and olﬁce was
evacuated and inspected during
these 22 minutes. Inspection was
‘carried on by the headquarters

. unit, which was divided into three -

groups, each consisting of a pair

of inspectors.

The ﬁrst group proceeded down-

ard from the 36th to the 19th
goor, inspecting each room and dis-

,¥;l)issing any persons whom they

7 und -had not yet left the room

i tﬁor the designated shelter spots.
Members of the second group in- 0

ring was done about the animals kept

purposes, but all such animals are
caged and would be moved in the
event of an actual raid on the Ca-
thedral. ~ ’

“Probably the most outstanding
fact was the ﬁne cooperation of stu-

; dents and faculty during the ‘mock

';air raid,” remarked Dr. Geise in
reviewing the event.
. Several days after the drill, the
floor captains met with Dr. Geise

But what is signiﬁcant here is
that the government seems to have
taken the biggest step‘ in placing
schools on a war-time basis that
it has since the outbreak of the
war. The government has, by the
creation of this plan, with its
incumbent responsibilities upon
American colleges, done the follow-
ing ‘things:

1. Made it possible for large
numbers of students to be able to
ﬁnish their education before being
called into the army.

2. Laid the groundwork, in the
event of a “long war,” for assur-
ing the army and industry a
steady stream of trained manpow-
er. .

3. Come out deﬁnitely against
extra-curricular activities which
do not contribute to the war ef-

fort. ‘ H

4. Pointed out that students, in

_ the future, are going to be dilfer-
entially regarded by the govern-
ment on a basis of the scholastic
ability and performance.

For, according to the release.
students accepted into the corps
must maintain a high scholastic av-
erage, an enthusiastic interest in
what they are doing. Failure to do
this will mean being dropped from
the corps, with very little chance of
continuing at school once such a stu-
dent is called for selective service.

Beginning June 29, separate coursesin air and

demand,-six-weeks’ courses will be offered in the
regular day session as well as in the evening.
These four and six-weeks’ courses represent the
equivalent of a full semester’s work, and three full
college credits are granted to those who successfully
complete the course. ' ’
