IFC-Panhel to initiate
new alcohol program

By Julie Shepard

Staff Writer

A local law firm, Reed, Smith,
Shaw and McClay, has issued a
letter to Pitt's Student Activities
Office warning greek organiza-
tions of the new Pennsylvania
law concerning underage alcohol
consumption.

This law, which was signed by
Governor Casey on March 28,
1988 and will be effective July 1,
1988, states one of its offenses as
’’selling or furnishing liquor or
malt or brewed beverages to
minors.”

The minimum penalty is a
$1000 fine for the first offense
and a $2500 minimum penalty
for subsequent offenses.

”To colleges and universities
which ‘own or control’ buildings
in which underage students are
‘allowed’ to ‘possess’ alcohol, the
new statute not only presents dif-
ficult questions of criminal law
responsibility and interpretation,
but it also seems to predict that,
in the future, the scope of civil
law responsibility may continue
to expand rapidly,” said Edward
N. Stoner ll, the author of the
letter.

The lnterfraternity Council and
the Panhellenic Association took
action last March, prior to the ap-
proval of the new law, to resolve
the problem of underage drink-
ing, according to Chuck Farinella,
IFC president.

The two governing bodies of
Pitt's greek organizations are
planning a program called ”Our

Leading Education Dedicated to
Greek Excellence” to begin in the
fall term.

As fraternities and sororities
seek to gain new members in the
fall rush period, two events will
be available to them as well as
any university members concer-
ning alcohol awareness and safe
sex.

The programs will involve an
exhibit including audi0—visual
aids and lectures given by well-
known speakers.

Farinella said the programs
were devised because ”We saw
something we considered a
definite problem and we wanted
to solve it before it went any fur-
ther.”

The alcohol awareness pro-
gram, entitled ”Drinking Respon-
sibly," will feature Tom Coodale.
The second program, entitled
”Keeping Sex Safe," will have Dr.
Richard P. Keeling of the Univer-
sity of Virginia as its speaker.
Keeling is considered the nation's
leading expert on AIDS.

Farinella feels the alcohol pro-
gram was needed, since ”most
college students started to drink
before they ever got into col-
lege.’’

Michelle Jedlica, Panhel presi-
dent, said ”We don't want to tell
people what to do; we'd only like
to try to guide them.”

”lt’s going to be interesting to
see if the new law will do what
it's intended to do,” said
Farinella.

”| feel the long term solution is
an alcohol awareness program,”

City hospitals lead in
emergency treatment

By Mark Merlin
For The Pitt News

Each year, eight medical
students are selected from an ap-
plication pool of 600 to par-
ticipate in Pitt's Affiliated
Residency in Emergency
Medicine program, designed to
improve emergency treatment
and overall patient care.

During the second and t "rd
years of the program, establis ed
in 1981, the residents have one-
month shifts responding to calls
in the city of Pittsburgh.

The program is unique because
it is currently the only program in
the nation which takes emergen-
cy medicine residents out of the
traditional hospital environment
and gives them experience «in the
pre-hospital care of patients.

According to Dr. Stanley
Janasiewicz, a second—year
emergency medicine resident,
the physician responds to calls
such as cardiac arrest, respiratory
arrest, accidents involving entrap-
ment, shootings, stabbings and
suicide attempts.

”The decision to respond to a
call is up to the resident. If I feel
that I am needed on the scene, I
will respond, even if the patient’s
condition does not fit into a cer-
tain medical category," said
Janasiewicz.

According to Janasiewicz, the
primary advantage of having an
emergency medical resident on
the scene is that he has greater
medical knowledge than a
paramedic, and he is able to
legally employ different drugs

Agreement not exp

MOSCOW (AP) - Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev told
President Reagan today it may be
"time to bang our fists on the
table" to prod negotiators to con-
clude work on a treaty cutting
nuclear stockpiles by 50 percent.

But it was clear that an agree-
ment would not come at this
week's summit.

Officials in both delegations
said that the goal was to reach an
agreement before Reagan leaves
office next January. Gennady
Gerasimov, the Soviet Foreign
Ministry spokesman, said that
"unfortunately, there will be no
more signings” beyond minor
agreements finalized today.

On their third day of talks,

Reagan and Gorbachev met in
the Soviet leader's Kremlin ofﬁce,

  

sitting beneath a portrait of Karl
Marx. After their discussions, they

took an unscheduled strollv

through Red Square past Lenin's
Tomb and shook hands with sur-
prised tourists.

At a meeting with Soviet
students, Reagan was asked
about his impression of the Soviet
dissidents and refuseniks with
whom he met. Soviet newspapers
described one of the dissidents as
a collaborator with the Fascists
during World War ll. The presi-
dent said that he knew nothing
about this allegation.

Reagan said that Gorbachev
"has been most helpful and
agreeable about correcting" the
problems incurred by those
groups. "We have the same type
of thing in our country,” Reagan
said, blaming it on bureaucrats.

 
Afghan croplands

ruined for years

STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) —
The war in Afghanistan has cut
that country's food production by
one-half, and the devastated
cropland cannot support the im-
mediate return of millions of
refugees, according to a study
released Monday.

The survey said it will take at
least three years and $4 billion to
restore cropland and livestock af-
fected by nine years of fighting in
Afghanistan. Other officials have
said such reconstruction could

take 10 to 20 years.

According to professor Azam

High ' Court rule;

against D. C. ruling
Washington (AP) — The
Supreme Court today refused to
reinstate an affirmative action
plan designed to increase the
number of blacks in the District
of Columbia Fire Department.
The court, without comment,
let stand a ruling that the plan -
calling for hiring at least six
blacks for every 10 job openings
- unlawfully discriminates against
whites. ‘
The U.S. Circuit Court of Ap-

peals here ruled last year that the”

hiring quota violates federal law
and the Constitution.

Relying on recent Supreme
Court rulings, the appeals court
said that the plan is not narrowly
tailored to remedy past
discrimination.

”The advantage this system has
is that when one gets to these
points, the physician managing
the patient is physically there,”
Janasiewicz said.

Janasiewicz said he feels that
he is a part of a larger system.
”Because we deal with the
paramedics on a daily basis, we
end up appreciating their impor-
tance. Any conflicts that arise bet-
ween physicians and paramedics
are usually caused by a lack of
knowledge about what the.
paramedics do.”

Janasiewicz also said, ”Not on-
ly is our role a medical one, but
it is a role in terms of leadership
within the field. The physician in
the field serves as an adjunct to

* what the paramedics already pro-

vide, which can include legal ad-
vice as well as administrative ad-
vice.” I

Pittsburgh paramedic Joseph
Motika said the system cuts down
on potential problems.

Motika said/‘problems
paramedics have in dealing with
physicians are encountered
because some doctors do not
know what our training is.
Sometimes at cardiac arrests we
will have outside physicians who
do not deal with paramedics and
are not familiar with our patient
protocols ”

Motika pointed out that the

%~

EMS Physician solves this pro-qt

blem and prevents any confusion
over what should be done
medically for a patient.

Janasiewicz said Pittsburgh's

program will pave the way for the

future in pre—hospital emergency
care. ”As similiar programs
develop, medical directors will
begin to better appreciate the
things a physician can do in the
field along side of the medics."

Residency program is a part of the

quarters for the National Associa-

THE PITT NEWS

" Davis finds himself in

a Catch-22 situation;
it's pro ball or no ball

It started in the fall of 1985,

when the highly-touted running

‘back from Washington, Pa.,

widely considered the best high
school senior in the country,
began his stay at the University
of Pittsburgh.

His first collegiate game was
nothing less than spectacular.
The five—foot-11 superfrosh rush-
ed for 100 yards on 15 carries
and scored one ‘touchdown on a
26-yard run that included two un-
forgettable 360-degree spins to
avoid tackles.

MATT
MARTIN

He finished his freshman
season with 298 yards rushing,
third best on the team and three
touchdowns, despite playing in

only 13 quarters because of a

hamstring injury and a bruised
thigh.

The future looked bright for the
back from Washington. Possibly
too bright. Pitt's newest star was
blinded by the possibilities and
never quite recovered. T

\Brian Davis left Pitt midway
through his second semester due
to academic difficulties. He
would have been ineligible to
play for the Panthers in the fall
and decided to continue his

, athletic and academic education

elsewhere —— at a junior college.
But Davis lasted less than two
weeks at his first junior college.
He enrolled at Rockville (Md.)
Junior College, where he again
left with a sour taste in his mouth.
And then, last January, Davis
quietly re-enrolled at Pitt. With
the departure of Craig Heyward
to the National Football League,
Davis was battling with Adam
Walker for the starting tailback
spot. And with Davis's history of
exemplary running, it seemed
like he would be a shoe-in.
But another history haunted
Davis as well — his academic

failures. It came as a surprise to
some people that Davis was even
allowed to play spring football.
He missed the first week of spring
practice due to academics, but
was suited up once the second
week rolled around.

The Pitt athletic department
declined to let Davis speak to the
media, who wished to ask the ob-
vious question: ”How are your
grades?”

Here and there, Davis would
confide that classes were coming
along well and that his grades
were fine. And following spring
practice and the annual Blue-
Gold game, Davis found himself
seeded second on the depth
chart, behind Walker. .

Although Walker had a fine
year in the backfield last season,
rushing for 214 yards and a 5.6
yards-per—carry average while
playing second-fiddle to
Heyward, Davis seemed to be
the back destined for the starting
slot. .

So why was he second string to
Walker? Maybe the Pitt athletic
department knew something the
rest of us didn't. Less than two
weeks after the end of the winter
term, Davis again found himself
academically ineligible to com-
pete for Pitt in the fall.

And the university wasn't so
forgiving this time.

Davis was told by university
administration that his playing
days at Pitt were over for good.
Four times a loser was apparent-
ly one too many times.

The team itself apparently
wasn't too upset with Davis,
however. ”We certainly hope
things do work out for him,” said
Panther Administrative Assistant
Alex Kramer. ”We bear him no
ill will.”

Niceties aside, Davis was left
with the choice of either apply-
ing for admission at another col-
lege or petitioning the NFL to set
up a supplemental draft that
could allow him to enter the pro
ranks. With his prior experiences
in the college community, Davis

opted for the latter late last week.

By declaring himself eligible to
be drafted by one of the 28 NFL
teams, Davis lost all of his re-
maining college eligibility.
Should he not be picked up by a
pro franchise, his playing days
could be over forever.

Ideally, Davis will be drafted

‘by a team which feels his skills
are advanced enough to make a
contribution on the professional
« level somewhere down the road,
a project player. Realistically,
however, not many teams will be
willing to take a chance on a run-

Holloway gets to put experience

By Mark Cohen

For The Pitt News

Pitt cornerback Cornell
Holloway, a five-foot-11,
180-pound senior from Alliance,
Ohio, has some large shoes to fill.

Holloway is listed at the top of
Pltt’s depth chart as the team
looks ahead to fall camp this
August in Johnstown. The starting
corners last year, Gary Richard
and Quintin Jones, were both
selected in April's National Foot-
ball League draft.

”There’s not a whole lot of
pressure on me,” said Holloway.
”There are some big shoes to fill,
but there was just as much
pressure coming into games last
year." ,

"At first, 1987 did not provide
much opportunity outside of
special teams for Holloway. It
wasn't a lack of ability so much

_ as being at the wrong place at the

wrong time — Holloway plays
right cornerback; Richard was a
preseason All-American.
Holloway finally got substantial
playing time when Richard suf-
fered a groin injury early in the
ninth game at Rutgers. He filled
in admirably, making an intercep-
tion that led to a Panther
touchdown drive. Holloway was
rewarded with action in the
Bluebonnet Bowl, where the Pan-
thers lost to Texas, 32-27.
Holloway, nicknamed ”Opie”
by his teammates because his
youthful face resembles the
character on The Andy Griffith
Show, came to Pitt after lettering
in four sports at Alliance High
School and starting two seasons
at Snow (Utah) Junior College.
He is studying economics and ex-
pects to graduate in December,
1989. Holloway would like to

become a commodities broker.

For now, though, the only ex-

changes he is homing in on are
those between the center and
quarterback. Although Holloway
says the toughest part of his posi-
tion is playing man-to-man
defense; he does not like idling
in a zone.

’’I prefer playing man,” said
Holloway. ’’I like the
challenges.’’

Pitt is known for its physical
defense, and Holloway enjoys

that style.
”Sometimes I like to press the
receiver, kind of like Lester

Hayes,” he said, referring to the
Los Angeles Raiders’ defender,
who tries to deny receivers their
first step off the line of
scrimmage. ‘J
Despite a season spent mostly
observing, Holloway is grateful
for what happened last year. He
said he learned a lot, not only
about coverages but conditioning
as well, by studying Richard and

Jones. Holloway does not con-
sider himself inexperienced.

”Watching them gave me a lot
[of knowledge],” he explained,
”seeing how they do it and com-
paring it with how I play.”

Respect for the abilities of‘

Richard and Jones changed op-
ponents’ strategies in last fall's 8-4
season. Some refused to throw; in
fact, two opponents threw less
than ten passes apiece. With
Holloway and Alonzo Hampton,
another junior college transfer,
on the corners, game plans are
destined to change.

”They’|l think we're young and
inexperienced," said Holloway.
”But they're in for a big surprise.

”Other teams are going to
throw. That brings a big
challenge for me and Alonzo. But
if they throw, that's going to be
a big asset for us.”

of not finishing things he starts.

The Pittsburgh Steelers are
reluctant to comment on Davis's
current situation. ”None of our
people can comment until
something takes place,” said
Steelers Publicity Director Dan
Edwards. 1

Please see Davis, page 6

to work

Holloway has set two personal
goals this season: five intercep-
tions, and ”not to get beat  at
all. At least nothing over 30
yards."

Early in the season, one team
he expects to see passing is one
he wanted to play for while he
grew up in Ohio. Pitt will host
Ohio State Sept. 1 7, the first time
the Buckeyes will have visited Pitt
Stadium since 1951.

”When I was young,”
Holloway mused, ”it was a
dream of mine to play at Ohio
State. But I always liked Dan
Marino and Tony Dorsett.

”l’l| be excited that night. I've
always wanted to play against
them.”

If Holloway has his way, the
future commodities broker will
Corner the market that night — on

nterceptions.

Davis».--— Rose's suspension comes to end 

Continued from page 5

And for the ﬁrst time in Davis's
life, he will not be the one who
makes that something happen.
He is at the mercy of the NFL and
the one team which may want to
include him on its fall roster.

Davis may very well become
an NFL running back and live the
glory days he once envisioned.
But if not, all he'll have to
remember is that first Saturday,
the crisp autumn air, the spinn-
ing touchdown run, and how he
held the world in the palm of his ‘
hand, if just for a little-while.

Major League draft

begins today

The major league baseball draft
begins today, and the major topic
of discussion is Michigan pitcher
Jim Abbott.

Abbott was this year's winner
of the Sullivan Award, given an-
nually to the nation's best
amateur athlete.

Despite having only one arm,
Abbott is a definite first-round
prospect. In 39 career starts at
Michigan, Abbott is 26-8 with a
2.92 ERA, 13 complete games
and 179 strikeouts in 222
innings.

Hairston returns to
A’baIl’s Gladiators

Wide receiver Russell Hairston
is back on the Gladiator squad
after spending nearly a year in the
NFL. He spent most of last season
with the Atlanta Falcons but was
waived earlier this spring.

The Minnesota Vikings claim-
ed Hairston from the waivers list,
but he was released and has since
joined the Gladiators.

Hairston was the Arenaball
MVP in its inaugaral season last
year, leading the Gladiators to the
league title game.
