Despite a last—minute scheduling and fund-

one step closer to concluding their activi-
ties to honor Black History Month. Along
with several other Pitt groups, Black Action
Society hopes to use the month to educate
other students about black culture.

This has not been an easy process for
the student organizations. The BAS Fashion

on Tuesday from the Student Government
Board. BAS has been unable to promote the
annual fashion show because of a funding
delay. Fliers for the event should soon start
to appear around campus, several weeks
later than usual.

BAS requested a budget modiﬁcation
after Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall
and Museum double—booked BAS’s fashion
show on Feb. 25 with a Carnegie Mellon
University event. SGB President Molly Stie-
ber said BAS had to scramble to ﬁnd a new
venue after receiving the bad news from

could ﬁnd an on-campus location for the
show, knowing how popular it is among
the student body. The Wyndham Grand

p Pittsburgh Downtown hotel was the only

suitable location available on such short
notice. -

BAS then had to modify its budget in or-
der to pay for the Wyndham reservation.

“We see groups like BAS as capable of
having an off-campus event and still receiv-
ing a massive turnout,” Stieber said. “They
bring a lot to this campus, and they’ve been
around since the ’60s. ‘Plenty of people will
go. I know I’ll be there.”

Stieber and the Board approved the

budget modiﬁcation at Tuesday’s public
Board meeting in Nordy’s Place, which will
allow BAS to start promoting the Down-
town event. 5

Sophomore Halim Genus, the group’s I

executive assistant, said BAS did not receive
the funding for the Black Active Student
Intercollegiate Struggle Symposium this
year, an annual conference held at Pitt to
discuss issues in the black community. This
year’s theme was set to be “Meeting of the
Minds,” but last year’s Board decided not
to fund the event. p

BAS members didn’t expresstoo much
concern about the minds not meeting.

Pitt sophomore Corey Talley donates blood during the Red Cross-organized blood drive

Andrew Shull
For The Pitt News

Pitt senior Chris Stairiker’s blood donation

. yesterday was more personal than most.

Stairiker said he donated blood because
he had been sick-the past few times the

. Red Cross held blood drives on campus.
He likes to donate because someone he .

knows received numerous blood transfu-
sions during a four— to ﬁve-year fight with
leukemia. ' ‘

“It’s just my way of giving back, I guess,”
he said. V

Red Cross organizers thought yester-
day’s blood drive in the William Pitt Union
was especially important because dona-
tions often lag during the winter months
becauseof poor weather and other fac-
tors, while the demand for blood remains
high. ‘

Student volunteers and leaders hoped
to collect 50 donations to help the Red
Cross‘ meet its collection goals. Last night,
organizers reported collecting 36 dona-
tions after 48 people tried to give blood.
Two donations had to be thrown out, and
eight people did not meet donation re-
quirements. ‘ V

Pitt senior Christian Woods, president
of the Red Cross Club, said that as many
as 20 percent of-people who show up to
donate blood are turned away because
of the various restrictions on weight and
other issues. . ’

. red cells from the blood and returns the

held yesterday in the William Pitt Union.

Right now, the Red Cross is facing
particularly high demands. Bad weather
prompted some groups to cancel their
drives since the start of the year, causing
the Red Cross as a whole to lose an estimat-

Spampinato, the regional spokeswoman
for the group’s Greater Allegheny blood
services region.

In the Greater Allegheny region, which
covers parts of six states, 1,100 units of
blood have failed to be collected for the
same reason. _

Woods echoed worries about seasonal
shortages in blood collection during the
drive.

“There is always a greater need for do-
nations in the winter months,” he said.

Woods has been involved with the Red
Cross Club since his freshman year. He
said that the group tries to organize one
blood glrive per month. A

“One time I was volunteering at a blood
drive,.and I thanked someone on his way
out for donating. He said that he was in an
accident and had his life saved by a blood '
transfusion,” Woods said.

One unusuallelement of Wednesday’s
drive was the inclusion of double red cell
donation, a process that only removes

cause minor setbacks 

Black History Month 4 2

“We celebrate black history, black
awareness and the black community all
throughout the year,” Genus said. “We are
not at all embittered that we can’t have
one event.”

Genus said generating publicity has not
been a problem for his group, which contin-
ues to see good turnout at events. BAS uses
Facebook and tabling in Towers to promote
its smaller events, such this Friday’s Black
Consciousness Bowl and Karaoke Night in‘
Nordy’s Place.

For BAS, February holds just as much
weight as the other eleven months.

“The month does not bear extra im-

portance for African—Americans,” Genus

if said. “Black History Month was created to

perpetuate and propagate awareness for
people on the outside of black culture and
explain what it means to be black and the
impact of black history.”_ j -
‘BAS is not the only group on campus
observing the holiday month. Aronda
Starks, president of Pitt’s Caribbean "and
Latin American Student Association, said
that many students — both black and white
— have attended cultural events so far

 

this year. She hopes to keep that pattern

up throughout February at events like the
Bob Marley tribute scheduled for Monday
night. . .

Starks said the Student Association’s
February schedule is the fullest its been in
years. But talk of the larger, annual Black
History Month events doesn’t seem to be
circulating around campus yet, likely be-
cause of the funding delay.

Chanéll Turlington, vice president of
Pitt’s National Pan—Hellenic Council, said
that the University’s historically black and
multicultural fraternities and sororities
have been hosting their own individual
events, such as Sigma Gamma Rho’s Black

History Family Feud. But NPHC’s large, ~

collaborative event is the Step Show, in
which each historically black fraternity
and sorority square off in an intense dance
competition. ‘ ‘

“Stepping is anlimportant extracurricu-
lar activity to the historically black fraterni-
ties and sororities,” Turlington said. “It is‘
also a great asset of black culture, especially
during Black History Month.”

The NPHC Step Show will be held on

Feb. 26 at Soldiers and Sailors Memorial V

Hall and Museum.

FeelGood < 1

At some point duringthe dayethe shift goes
until 3 p.m. — some of the roughly 10 members
working the deli will take a lunch break. But the
group members always pay for their own grilled
cheese to support the cause.

Allsandwiches cost $3, but its not uncommon
for customers to pay more or to refuse change,
preferringthatalltheir money goes toward ending
hunger, the group’s president, Alyssa Weisensee,
said. The deliwilltake $1 or $100 forasandwich,
although it aims to raise at least $400 aweek.

The ﬁmding for ingredients comes from Stu-
dent Government Board and FeelGood World.
The group has also received some donations of
ingredients from local businesses.

Although theytake pride intheir sandwiches,
Members oftentell customers abit aboutthe orga-
nization’s goals while they’re payingand hand out
paper slips with more details on the ﬁght against
world hunger.

“We deﬁnitelytiyto ask [customers] with every
purchase that they make, ‘Do you know where
your money goes?’ ‘Do you knowwhatthe Hunger
Project is?’ But I think that’s one of the cool parts
of FeelGood that they can make an impact even
without digging deep into it,” Weisensee said.

Pitt junior Benjamin Robinson said he’s aﬁe-
quent wstomer ofFeelGood. Although service isrft
always as quickas the neighboring Schenley Cafe,
the FeelGood members areexceptionallyﬁiendly
and he likes to support their effort, he said.

“World hunger is a very, very ﬁne cause,”
Robinson said. “Ifthey made [the price] more
expensive, I’d probably still support it.”

Carly Pelchen, a Pitt junior and regular Feel-
Goodcustomer, hasthreesimple reasons for grab-
bing lunch there.

“It’s betterthanallthe otherPittfood, it goesto
a good cause and I love grilled cheese,” she said.

The group’s goal for this academic year is to
raise $12,501.80 far, they have raised more than
$8,700, Weisensee said. Lastyearitraised $9,000.
FeelGood World lets every chaptersetagoalasto
how much it wants to raise.

Findingagoodfeeling .

Kristin Walter, co—founder and executive direc-
tor of FeelGood World, came across the Hunger
Projects website as anundergrad at the University
of Texas and was inspired to raise money for the
g1‘011P-

“I was incredibly eager to make a difference,‘
and I didn’t want to wait anymore. I didrft want
to wait until I graduated,” she said.

Walter’s then-boyfriend, nowher husband,
was a student at the University of Vermont and
toldlWalter how fellow students raised money
for Phish concerts by selling grilled cheese sand-
wiches. Walter liked the idea, and she raised $160
in herﬁrstweek of selling grilled cheese. To keep
raising more money, she turned her endeavor into
a student organization at Texas.

A Nearly a year later, in December of 2004, the
grouphadraised about $10,000. Waltergraduated
that year, but didnit want to stop her organiza-
tion, so she and a friend decided to take it to the

‘national level. The FeelGood title simply reﬂects

thesentiment shared by members and support-
ers, Walter said.
While taking part in the Semester at Sea pro-

gram, a group of former Pitt students met Walter’s
brotherand learned aboutFeelGood. Upon return-
ingin2008, they initiated the chapter at Pitt.

' The money ﬁ'om FeelGood that goes to the

Hunger Project aids a variety of communities in,

Latin America, Aﬁica and South Asia. The or-
ganization works closely with communities to
eliminate chronic hunger instead ofjust dropping
olf a shipment of food.

“Most communities, especially in Africa, are
used to people coming in  and handingthem
something out,” Walter said. “So Hunger Project
staff will arrive and [community members] will

say‘give me ahandout give me ahandout. Give me
clothes orwhatever.’ And [the stalf] willsay, ‘Look
We’re not hereto give youahandout. We’re here to
partnerwithyouto create anewﬁi 3”

The HungerProjectworks with communities
on a variety of social issues, such as eliminating
gender inequality or improving literacy rates. It
could also help a community develop new irri-
gation systems or build community centers. It
stresses that hunger as an issue is more complex
than just having nutritional food available. It’s
best combated through long-terrn community

V development ratherthan temporary ﬁxes.

go to hunger-fighting charities

“One of ourtaglines is ‘partnership not charity,’
so this idea that ending hunger really isrft about
a handout, it’s about empowering the potential
and the self-reliance inour human family,” Walter
said.

Alter realizing she doesn’t have money, she asks

Tech ag to blame
for Borders’ demise

tween books and failure, it’s
usually that we fail to read
them.

But as of yesterday, it seems
that failure has also descended
onto a major book retailer itself:
Borders. Forty years and mil-
lions of pages since its launch
in Ann Arbor, Mich., the chain
ﬁled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
on Wednesday. According to the
company’s bankruptcy ﬁling, it
accumulated $1.29 billion in debt
with only $1.27 billion underly-
ing assets.

Among the 30 percent of the
650 stores Borders plans closing
— the so—called “underperform—
ing” stores — are three Pittsburgh
locations, the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette reported yesterday. The
Monroeville Mall, Bethel Park
and East Liberty stores will get
the ax.

After anticipating the bank-
ruptcy for months, analysts
blame the fall of Borders on
strategic misdirection, overex-
pansion and a general lagging
behind book retailers like Ama-
zon.com and Barnes 8: Noble in
online book sales, according to
The New York Times.

Though we send our condo-

I f there’s any correlation be-

’ lences to the affected Borders

employees in the area, most bib-
liophiles of Pittsburgh needn’t
worry. The book writing and
book publishing industry is far
from lost.

In fact, with Borders gone,

the book market might beneﬁt
overall.
Analysts told the Times that

77‘ _..-.   5...»... .. ;...._,.'. 4.... ,..,., ..i ,, ,,

Borders’ substantial debt with
landlords and publishers that

might go largely unpaid, mak— I

ing it easier for other stores like
Barnes 8: Noble to leverage their
position with landlords and pub-
lishers. Cheaper rent and cheaper
manufacturing prices could mean
less pocket pain for customers.

But more importantly, taking
Borders from the scene seems to
make Darwinian sense. Surely,
Borders.com lists “The Origin
of Species” for $6.95, but before
May 2010, customers couldn’t
read it on a Borders-backed e-
reader. The Borders Kobo came
long after the Amazon Kindle
and Barnes & Noble Nook, but
it wasn’t even launched with a
wireless option and before this
story, we hadn’t even heard of
the Kobo. The New York Times
also reports that Borders didn’t
have a viable Internet commerce
site of its own until 2008.

The point here is that with
about $13 billion in book sales
per year, the market for books
is as vibrant as fever, and a com-
pany that didn’t capitalize on the
waxing trends of book digitaliza-
tion and online ordering seems to
have personally bought a ticket
to the United States Bankruptcy
Court.

As much as us paper—lovers
hate to admit, e-reading is con-
necting consumers — or those
lucky few who choose to con-
sume books — to the full range
of literary niches in a way never
before known. Book providers
should understand this. Borders
didn’t.

Aid cuts a mixed bag

Proposed Pell Grant cuts perhaps valuable weed-out tools, but could backﬁre

 
   

Jacob Brown
Columnist

I remember the good ol’ hoorah stu-
dents espoused around here when
President Barack Obama was still a
candidate touring around the coun-

“He’ll make college more afford-
able!” you’d hear legions of devout
_0bama followers say. I suppose even
I hoped that if he were elected, he’d
come through for us on that one.

But the closest he has come inthat
respect since assuming his presiden-
tialrolewasto raisethe per—yearmaxi-
mum Pell Grant $200, orfrom $5,350
to $5,550 inJuly2oo9. Itbecame part
of what would have been a 31 percent
federal increase in educational fund-
ing, with the Chronicle of Higher
Education reporting last year that
Obama’s proposed 2011 educational
budget would have totaled $77.8 bil-
lion (Congresswastoo mired inparti-

san gridlock to pass an FY2011 budget,

late last year, so Obama’s education

boosts never took effect).

But just a year after planning in-
creases, it already looks like the great
leader is proposing a slash of $100
billion in Pell Grants and other educa-
tional ﬁmding over the next decade,
accordingto reports from the Associ-
ated Press. Good thingl didn’t drink
that batch of Kool-Aid.

Proposed cuts come from elimi-
nating “year-roun ” Pell Grants that
cover summer college expenses, less-
ening grants to graduate students and
scrutinizingIRS records more closely
to cut overlooked extras.

In all, this Pell program reaches
more than 9 million students armually,
potentiallysnubbing many of them of
anticipatedﬁinds if Obama’s cuts were
to pass. And it likely will.

Republicans have even said they
wanted to cut Obama’s. 2011 budget
by $100 billion. Now, it’s just a matter
of from where.

The timing of this gives me an ap-
preciation for getting out of school
while the goings still good. As a self-
supporting college student, federal
ﬁindinghasbeen incrediblybeneﬁcial

to me despite my disdain for govem-
mental girth.

As much as the great ideal is to
have a governmentrunforthe people,
by the people, sometimes amodicum
of welfare is needed to invest in the
future stock of our society. It just
needs to be administered properly
+ something the government can’t
do a lot of times. Take, for example,
Obama’s recent $53 billion proposal
for a high—speed railway — because
if France and China have them, they
mustbe essentialforthe United States,
too. To provide such an infrastruc-
ture for the country would likely cost
much more than the proposed ﬁgure,
and it’s completely unnecessary in a
spread-out country like ours. But I
digress. The federal monolith knows
better than we do, so expect noth-
ing less than misappropriations and
Congressional in-ﬁghting of morally
rightbut logically insane Republicans
ﬁghting against idealistic yet naive
Democrats. , l .

Then again, they might be onto
something —— or I might just be an
unsympathetic schmuck. Let ‘me ex-

she disagrees with its reputation as
“controversial.”

“I am always taken aback when
‘The Vagina Monologues’ are hailed

as controversial,” she said. “Yes, ‘va-

is intense. But the very fact that the
show appears controversial  points
to the very reasons it needs to [ap-

Jackson-Schebetta began to ad-

“Theater asks us to empathize,
to see the world through the eyes of
another being, to meet another with
compassion,” she said.

Many of the subjects featured can
be difficult to address. Qiu and Rous-

stage the topics of violence, silence,
shame, racism and sexism while in-

for [Qiu and I] to even begin to think
about what a set entails or how we

MOVIE COLUMN

Tybout: Rankings should
be left to critics’ tastes 

Andy Tybout
Assistant Aé-}E Editor

At this point in ﬁlm history, many complaints

' about the Academy Awards have become

almost as tired as the ceremony itself. Allow
me, then, to offer one criticism you probably
haven’t heard before: The Oscars are just too
damn democratic. '
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences is composed of more than 6,000
members — a number that exceeds the
population of many Pennsylvanian towns.
All academy members nominate contenders
in their designated ﬁelds —— actors vote on
actors, screenwriters on screenwriters’ —
and all members are allowed to nominate
a ﬁlm for Best Picture. Most members are
subsequently eligible to vote on the ﬁnal
victors in each category. 0 ,
Naturally, this approach —-a large col-
lection of experts casting ballots in their
areas of expertise — is intended to bolster
the academy’s credibility. After all, we’re
meant to assume that the bigger the voter

The Oscars’ voters pick popular winners over quality ones.

MCT Campus

base, the better. The ﬂawed judgments of
individual participants are overridden, so
to speak, by a reasonable majority.

Of course, the results of this mentality
are depressingly apparent: Winners are
predictable to the extent that pop culture
pundits are actually quite adept at picking
the winners. Last year, for instance, no one
had any doubts that either “Avatar” or “The
Hurt Locker” would win Best Picture, or that
Sandra,Bullock would win Best Actress for
“The Blind Side.” Ultimately, the academy’s
practice of polling a large body of voters only
engenders an aﬂirmation of conventional
opinion.

Indeed, democracy, on any scale, has no
place in criticism. Contrary to the beliefs
underpinning the Oscars and other awards
shows, the idea that a ﬁlm is superior simply
because any number of people believe it’s
superior is a pitiably misguided notion. After
all, to deem a certain movie “better” than
another, as a result of a survey, presumes the
participants’ heterogeneous critical stan-
dards somehow complement one another.
In reality, of course, critical opinions don’t

The breezy sounds that come from The ACBs isn’t
stereotypical of a band from the Midwest. Listen-

album Stona Rosa. Unfortunately, they won’t ﬁnd
anything original, either.

album in2007. Butwhen the band traveledto Cali— '

Now with a new drummer and guitarist, The

directors of the show in the past. “We were also
limited by the lack of resources available.”

Another difficulty is that David Lawrence
Hall is no theater hall. Qiu and Roussos lack
a real backstage" area and a real curtain and
backdrop, among other practical things.

But they have a stage and 24 Pitt students
willing to share another woman’s story with
whoever would listen.

Qiu warns the audience that these Pitt stu-
dents won’t be “acting too much.”

“It’s more of the actor telling another
woman’s story and less of them becoming that
character,” Roussos said. “There’s no getting
inside the character like you would in,tradi-
tional theater,” she said. That difference called
forthe opportunity to refocus the goals Qiu and
Roussos originally had for the production.

“We were forced to_ approach [the “Mono—
logues”] with a completely different mind-
set,” Qiu said. “This is nothing extravagant
like ‘High School Musical.’ It’s real.”

There are no costumes, and actors are
required to keep the script, as cue cards, on
stage with them, free fromlthe restraints of
traditional theater.

within have allowed her to have fun with thee‘,

chance to do in quite a while. “It’s like intro-

she said.

Harris hopes that the ﬁm that she’s having
with the show transfers to her audience. She

also warns that the show is unpredictable, tm"'

say the least.

“Yes, some of the subject matter is taboo
and the show has its uncomfortable moments,
but at other times, it’s a truly funny show,”
she said.

Professor George noted, “Some plays aim
to soothe and entertain. Others engage us in
a puzzle orwork our emotions and bring us to
tears. Another one of the functions of theater
is jolting people out of complacency or ﬁxed
notions. ‘Vagina Monologues’ was born to do
that.” I A

studio where he and other artists spend much
of their time creating. ,

In his studio, he has two long tables where
he does the majority of his artwork. Along the
walls are jars ofbroken glass and other supplies
neatly color—coded. The opposing room holds
much of Stevo’s artwork, where he occasionally
shows it to prospective clients.

But getting to this workspace took time, he
spent years working on a ﬁber line producing
sweaters and scarves before he started working
with mosaics in the early ’9os.

Around the same time, he moved into ahouse
in Highland Park that had leftover tiles and cof-

fee cans from the previous owner. -From then ’

on, he focused more on mosaic art, his most
common creation.

Toni Ault, a senior designer at the Pipitone
Group, a marketingﬁrm in Pittsburgh, met Stevo
shortly after he began" his mosaics. Stevo was

Kl ‘working at a South Side restaurant when the

two met and she hired him to do a mural in the

. to more traditional wall art.

Stevo often does in—home installations of
his art, chargingpeople about $1,200 to place
mosaics along the walls of their kitchens. He
photographs a client’s kitchen and makes a com-
puter-generated representation of different tile
patterns for the newly decorated space.

“I can pretty much just zero in on what it’s
goingto look like, and that’s a really cool process
thatl have a lot of success with,” he said.

Stevo also does various public installations of
his mosaic art throughout the Pittsburgh area. In
places such as South Side Works and Downtown,
his mosaic creations decorate businesses, street
signs and walls.

He has collaborated on"multiple occasions
with the city’s Department of Parks and Recre-
ation tohelp different groups of children develop
their own mosaic art in public parks. Nancy
Burns, the program manager of the department,
said that through these public projects, Stevo

Florida, but once again,'he wasn’
in uniform. , V 1

- Gibbs, a game—timevdecision
recovering froman MCL injury,
missed the team’s third game ina
row. For much of the game, Gibbs’
absence was painfully obvious as
the Panthers offense just couldn’t
ﬁgure out South Florida’s zone
defense.

Pitt allowed the heavy under-
dog Bulls (8-19, 1-12 Big East) to
keep it close late into the sec-
ond half, but then the Panthers
(24—2, 12-1 Big East) found their
shooting stroke when it mattered
most and used a crucial 14-2 run
to escape with a 67-55 win.

The victory takes Pitt’s record
to 3-0 without Gibbs. This was
also the third consecutive game
that four Panthers have scored
in double digits.

“We’re a very balanced team
and everyone can step up and
make plays,” senior guard Brad
Wanamaker said in a_post-game

press conference. “That’s what '

we showed tonight.”

It took a South Florida missed
layup to spark the Panthers’ run
and awaken Pitt’s offensive at-
tack. ‘ '

With just under eightrninutes _

remaining and Pitt leading by
two, it appeared like South Flor-
ida was about to tie the game as

sophomore guard Shaun Noriega ‘
stole the ball and ran the length » '

of the court for a layup.

But Panthers guard Travon
Woodall sprinted back and pres-
sured Noriega —— causing him to
miss — and Pitt quickly passed
the ball up the court where senior
forward Gary McGhee converted
a layup while getting fouled.

‘‘That’s a play I really re-
gret now,” Noriega said after
the game. “I should’ve went up
stronger.”

“That ﬁve—point swing hap-

pened, and we just never recov-
ered,” South Florida head coach

Stan Heath said.

Following McGhee’s free
throw, Wanamaker hit the Pan-
thers’ second and ﬁnal 3-pointer
of the game to put them up by
eight.

It would prove an insurmount-
able lead as, from that point on,
South Florida never got within

"eight points of the Panthers.

“We did really well to keep our
poise and execute toward the end
of the game,” Wanamaker said.

Toward the end of the first
half, it appeared like Pitt would
cruise to a victory.

Freshman forward Talib Zan-
na_ controlled the offensive glass
early on and he scored an impres-
sive eight consecutive points for
Pitt about 10 minutes into the
game.

Pitt goes for league title againstEdinboro

Second consecutive title in reach as Panthers look to stay unbeaten in EWL play heading into postseason

Mike Furlong
Staff Writer

It’s hard to imagine that before
last season the Panthers wres-
tling squad had never won an
Eastern Wrestling League Cham-
pionship. . ‘

On Friday at 7 p.m_._, the Pan-
thers have the opportunity to so-
lidify their second consecutive
championship. But to guarantee
the title, the Panthers need to
take down their league foe: the

Edinboro Fighting Scots. The

Fighting Scots will have to de-

feat both Pitt and West Virginia .

to win the crown.

“It should be an exciting
match for us.” assistant coach
Jason Peters said. “Anytime you
wrestle against a team with such
good competition, it will be ex-
citing. We have tried to prepare
the same way that we always do.
We’ll let the outcome take care

of itself —— we just need to come

out aggressive.”
The Panthers (12-6, 5-0 EWL)

have to travel to take on the Fight-
ing Scots (8-9-1, 3-1 EWL). The

me last season tohave to sit out
as a redshirt from the match, so it
feelsgood to be able to be a part
of the team this time around.”

Redshirt junior Tyler Naul-‘ii

the match with Edinboro since

New York Islanders rookie Michael Grabner is taking the league by storm this season

Greg Trietley
Senior Staff Writer

 

Midterms are in the air, so I’ll keep
things short and sweet with a little study
break.

But did you hear about Norris Cole?

The Cleveland State guard dropped
41 points, 20 rebounds and nine assists
on the Youngstown State Penguins men’s
basketball team Saturday.

Although the Penguins are tied for
last in the Horizon League at 2-13, Cole
deserves accolades for the feat and for
scoring double- digit points in every game
this season. I do, however, have reserva-
tions about him and the Vikings until they
beat Butler. ' 6

The Butler Bulldogs aren’t what they
once were — their next loss will double
the number they had last season — but

and has grabbed Greg Trietley’s attention.

Cleveland State is still 0-2 against them
this season. Cole needs to put on a show in
the conference tournament against Butler,
assuming the teams meet, before I demol-
ish my bubblegumjimmer Fredette shrine
and build one for him.

Cole could also post a quadruple—dou-
ble next game. That’d do. In 2007, Lester

4 Hudson of Tennessee-Martin logged the

only one in Division I history, recording
25 points, 12 rebounds, 10 assists and 10
steals. That’s my stat of the day.

But hey! Did you hear about the George-
town Hoyas? .

Any respectable Big Eastern soul has
to stand and recognize when another pro-
gram is on a roll, and Georgetown is that
program. The Hoyas lost to Pitt Way back

' in mid-January, and didn’t lose to anyone

again until last night. They bested Syra-
cuse and Villanova on the road and up-
ended Louisville and St. John’s at home.

Pitt dominates Clarion,

the Panthers want a matching one for this
season.

“Edinboro is always a tough match —
it’s not quite as big a rivalry as West Vir-
ginia, but we always want to beat them,”
Nauman said. “Everyone says they’re hav-
ing a down year, but I know they want to
try and beat us.”

Last season, the Panthers captured the
team title against Edinboro in front of a
home crowd at the Fitzgerald Field House
by a score of 21-13.

The Panthers enter the showdown with
Edinboro after having won two dual meets
last Thursday night over Clarion and at
home on Friday night over Cleveland State.
The Panthers dominated Clarion with a ﬁ-
nal score of 32-9 and dismantled Cleveland
State by a score of 41-3 on Senior Night.

“I think we performed particularly well
last week,” Peters said. “We’re deﬁnitely
competing at a high level and we’re picking
up a lot of bonus points.”

Against Clarion, freshman Max Thomus-
seit picked up his 24th victory of the sea-
son, tying the team lead. Redshirt senior
Ryan Tomei notched another pin in his
belt, taking him to 38 career falls — ﬁve
short of the Panthers record of 43 set by
Pat Santoro. Redshirt junior Tyler Nauman
also raised his season record to 20-3.

“Lately, I feel like we’ve been wrestling
very well,” Headlee said. “We’ve beaten
some really good teams and wrestled a lot
of top competition. All of that has made

these conference matches a lot easier for
us as a team.”

Plenty of the team’s success is due to
the graduating seniors. On Friday night,
the Panthers introduced four senior wres-
tlers to honor their contributions to the
program. Christian Fagan, Kyle Patton,
Adam Counterman and Tomei all walked
onto the Fitzgerald Field House mat for the
ﬁnal time in their careers. Also introduced
was senior manager Liz Rice.

“You know having something like that
really brings out mixed emotions,” Peters
said. “It’s happy to see these guys that
came in as freshman grow and mature
while they were here, but with all the time
we spend together it’s a little tough to see
these guys go.”

Looking ahead

In the match with Cleveland State, the
Panthers picked up Victories in nine of 10
bouts on their way to the team win.

The only loss for the Panthers was
Headlee at 165 pounds. Headlee looks to
bounce back from the match after some
discussions with older brother Drew Head-
lee a three—time EWL champion and 2005
All—American at Pitt.

“I have been talking to Drew a lot after ,

the match last week,” Headlee said. “He
has been helping me a lot to refocus to
make a run at the rest of the season. A big
goal for me is looking ahead to EWL Indi-
viduals and the NCAA Championships.”

Wrestling<. 16 {$3.

' The Fighting Scots‘ currently have ﬁve

At 184 pounds, junior Chris Honeycutt
is currently ranked No. 1 in the nation after
rolling to a 22-0 record this season. Ma?
Thomusseit hopes to be the first wrestler
this season to best Honeycutt.

“It’s always exciting to see a freshman
match up with a top-ranked guy,” Peters
said. “I think it should really help in his de-
velopment. You know, Max’s older brother
Zac has had the opportunity to wrestle the
