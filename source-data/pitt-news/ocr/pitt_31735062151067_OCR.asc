‘ The Johnstown Pitt" clubmenlbers
were the guests of _Coach Glenn
\/Varner, Capt. Carlson and the var-
sity foot-ball squad at Camp Hamil-
ton, September 20. About 35,of the
Flood C-ity “gr-ads” -and students were
-present and a regular banquet was
spread for them‘ by Chef “Dory”
Moore. Many motored out in the
afternoon and saw the football scrim-
mage while the late-comers were all
on deck by 7 ~o’clo_cl<, After everyone
had" eaten’ his"‘ﬁll,” Dr. J. B. O’.Don-_
nell, president of the.club, acted as
toastmaster ..and' called on “Pop”
VVarner for alfew remarks. The “Old
Boy”. told what a ﬁne -bunch of fel-
lows he had to work with and while
not predicting a team the equal of
“Bob” Peck’s 1916 crowd, said he felt-

game. . ‘

Other speakers were Prof. H. J.
Stockton of John-s-town High school,
Dr. C. B. Robertson, Dr. P. V. Me-.
I’-ax-land, Capt. Cliff Carlson‘ and
Graduate Manager. Davis. Music was
furnished by M~cVay’s Pep Orchestra,
and it certainly was “Peppy.” The
affair was planned last w-in-tervat the
time of the club’s banquetat the
Hotel Fort Stanwix and is likely to
be an annual event in future. Those
present from Johnstown were: J. A.

to go at it piecemeal. ‘Each week

the uncertain future we can see a day
when the dove of peace .will again

accurate alumni records. Help us

PITT STARTS
HOME SEASON

Pitt will inaugurate its vfrootball sea-
son at home this Saturday~i.vi'l;h_,Beth-
any College .as its opponents." While
t-his game is.not considered one of
the big ones, it will n~ever‘th=eles_§,
arouse much interest in view of the
fact that Coach Warner _is recon-
structing his team -and the ‘fans will
want to know now he is going to line
up hi-s huskies.

However, the game will b; by no
means a walk away for Pitt for the
Bethany lads are known for -their
pluckiness a-rid will battle hard -to hold
down the Pitt team. Bethany has‘
some real stars in its lineup and now
that Elder is »back the stock of that
team has ‘been bo-osted considerable.

Just what lineup Coach VVarner will
s-end into the game is pr-oblematical
as he may shift it at the last rninute
It is quite likely that Stahl will-again
be ‘found at center, but this leaves
three places still where there is con-
siderable doubt as to who will start
the game. These positions -are right
end, right half and quarter. The va-
rious men are ﬁghting hard to _be se-
lected for the start and it seems that
any one of them has a chance up to
the time of the game.

The team that went up against
West Virginia did not show the same
punch as the great 1916 machine, but
with a few more hard licks th-e re-
constructed eleven is expected to show
up better and as the season prio-
gresses will round into the old time
form. 'VVarner is always switching
his men -around in an efflozrt to. find
the -best combination and there may
be a few surprises fdr the fans when
they see the team on the ﬁeld. .,

The 1917 season has presented VV«ar-
ner with the greatest ’task_ of his
career. He has lostthe best men of
his 1916 machine through graduation
and enlistments, while the best ‘bets

‘on last year’s Fries-hman eleven have

also entered Uncle Sam’s services.
This leaves him only a few varsity
men ,a handfull of last year's substi-
tutes and a bunch of recruits from the-
yearling team. It is indeed a problem
to dope out a winning combination
and with the training season consider-
ably shortened, Warner’s problems,
are far from being solved. _

PITT SPRINT ER  

NATIONAL CHAMP

h———.—-—&ﬂ&-

Forankg Shea, is-tar of last year’s
Fr.es'hman track" team ‘and hold-er of
the University record in the .440-ysard
dash, h.as added to his laurels this past
summer by capturing the National A.
A. U. champi-onship inlathe quarter at
St. Louis over a large ﬁeld of entries.
Shea is in his second year a-t Pitt and

has three years yet on -the varsityﬁ

Unless something unforeseen happens,
this\ young athlete should develop

into one of the gre'at~es:t sprinlters the ,
country has ever ‘produced. The fol- I
lowing from the Irwin Republican Stand- V

ard shows the rapid development of
this star:

Sheals rapid development has sur-*
prised even his staunchest supporters.
He has been running only a little over
two seasons and in «that time he has
showed his superiority over all quar-
ter milers and he is now the world's
champion 440 runner, for the war has
disrupted European athletes.

On July 10‘, 19415, Shea ran and won
his ﬁrst race in a meet. He ran the
.100 yard dash and had a handicap of
seven yards. He kept improving and
then attracted quite a lot of attention
by beating Morse, -the U. S. cham-

pion -in the 220, June, 1916, and againl

this year he beat the -champs.

Last fallxhe entered Pitt and this
spring demonstrated that he was -the
classiest sprinter tha-t had ever en-
tered -the school by breaking the rec-
ord in the 440 and coming close to the
records in both the 220 and 100 yard
dashes. The meet in which he broke
the 440 record was held at State Col-
lege and it set a new mark for -that
track.

She~a’s ‘best time -officially recorded
in the 440 was made" two weeks ago
in the Middle Atlantic championships
at Philadelphia, when he set a new
record at 49 seconds ﬂat. He has
been caught at 48 3-5 seconds in a
relay. The world's record for -this
stretch on a curve track, the kind on
which Frank has been running is
47 2-5, set by Meredith in 1914. The
best time for a straightaway is 47
flat made by Long in 1900.

In the other sprints t-his star is also

 
 
 
  
 

approaching the records. His best
time in the 220 is 22 seconds ﬂat_while
the world's record is only 4-5 of a
second less. He has done the century
stretch in 10 ﬂat several times.

During his two ye-:ir’s running Shea
has made quite a colllecition of medals
and his pile is closely» approaching the
hundred mark. His biggestday in
landing on top was at Philadelphia
this summer where he captured fsour
firsts and then had to quit because of
illness after he had won his heat in
another event. .

THE snnns 

The reconstructed Panther team
celebrated the opening of the 1917 sea-
son with a 14-9 victory over_ the
veteran V\/est Virginia team. Satur-
day’s win over the Mountaineers
served as an acid test for the inex-
perienced Blue and Gold squad and
-the fact that they weathered it satis-
factorily is :1 source of great satisfac-
tion "to all Pitt Rooters.

Before the contest _much doubt
reigned as to the possibilities of the
team, but the performance of the men
under fire swept all the doubts away.
True, the play was very ragged at
times, but the ﬁrst half, when the team
did play football, they proved that
they still had the punch and that the
team could be developed into 21 con-
siestcnitly playing combination. In
many respects the game is comparable
to the Navy clash of a year ago and
with the sliakiness out of its system
the team will develop, under the able
coaching of V\/arner, into a real power
as the season progie-;scs.

I-IOVV PITT SCORED.

The first two periods were of a dis-
tinctly Blue and Gold hue. VVarner’s
famous “barrage” interference blotted
out the opposing forwards and swept
their secondary defense aside for the
gains that gave the Panthers a 14-0
lead over the Mountaineers at the end
of the first half. ,

The first touchdown came at the
very beginning of the seoond quarter.
The ball was Pitt’s on the opponent’s
30-yard line. McLarcn punctured the
right guard‘ for two yards. -Gougler
then followed with 12, and then .re-
peated for 10 more. Easterday failed
to gain and then McLaren took the
-ball and smashed his way through the
remaining distance to the goal. The
second Panther tally came in the lat-
ter part of the same period after Stahl
-had recovered King’s fumble. Goug-

ler than annexed 25 yards and a ﬁrst '
