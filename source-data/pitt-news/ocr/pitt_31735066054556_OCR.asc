its case for constructing new student
housing in South Oakland

The result of the ﬁnal vote on the
garden-style apartments will be
armounced Wednesday, and City
Council is expected to approve the
project, according to pin spokesman
Ken Service. ,

“We won’t know until the actual
vote, but we’re optimistic,” he said.

One member of the council, Dan
Cohen, described the whole housing
issue as “a beautiﬁrl py .”

Only two people at themeeting
expressed opposition to Pitt’s propos-
al, while an overwhelming number
of residents spoke out in support

James Bender, a representative

for_ the Carnegie museums and,

libraries in Oakland, spoke of the
organization’s experience with the
University-owned P Forbes-Craig
apartments, which are near the
Camegie’s Oakland facilities.

“We deﬁne them to be good
neighbors, and we ﬁnd it important
that you know,” Bender said.

City Council members agreed

community.

“It behooves us all to get

. “It’s a major improvement from

Gene Riccardi, another member
of the council, said, “I’m very
pleased with the design and location
of the housing. I like the University as
a landlord because I know where
they live. [Pitt’s buildings are] the
ones that are always we]l—kept and up
to code.” .

The University says the new

“It will eliminate illegal hous-

Susan Balm, a representative for

Development  agreed the
new housing will squeeze slumlords.
“Student housing will have an

He1mutTuerk, Austrian ambassador
to the United States, came“ to Pitt
Thursday, spreading the word that
Austria has no intention of remaining on
the outskirts of the European Union.

Instead, the country intends to make
entrance into the Union more a reality
than a dream for fonner nations of the
Communist bloc, an area that separated

Western‘ Europe from the Soviet Union‘

for much of the latter half of this centu-

ry.
Headlining as the ﬁrst speaker to
kick off Pitt’s new European Union

Center, the Austrian ambassador dis-

cussed many of the problems plaguing
the future of the European Union,
including the vast differences between
West and East European countries, and
what Austria hopes to do about it.
“Austria wants to see a European

uslrianmbasclor  
wonis unifiecl Europe

Union that the U.S. also wants to see,”
said 'I‘uerk to an over-capacity crowd in
Forbes Quad’s second-ﬂoor lecture
room. “We want a European Union that
can speak clearly about its desires, that
is open‘ to the whole of Europe, that can
spread peace and prosperity throughout
the continent, and that has a good rela-
tionship with the U.S.”

Tuerk’s visit to Pitt’s campus last
week wasn’t the ﬁrst in his role as
Austrian ambassador. He inaugurated‘
the opening of the Austrian nationality
room on June 9, 1996.

“The nationality room celebrates
Austria’s past, but the ambassador’s
visit today symbolizes Austria’s future,”
said John Cooper, Dean of Pitt’s Faculty
of Arts and Sciences.

On July 1, Austria took over the
presidency of the European Union from
the United Kingdom. Now, two months

Clinton's   lawyer: impeachment unwarranted

ACROSS THE COUNTRY

WASHINGTON President
Clinton’s lawyer said that while
Clinton may be guilty ‘of wrongdo-
ing, he did not commit perjury. .

._ Appearing on ABC’s “This
Week,” David Kendall said Clinton is
not guilty of any impeachable offens-
es. He also said Kenneth Starr’s

that there is no evidence the presi-
dent is guilty of lying under oath in

suit.
Kendall called impeachment the

the first. He said there is nothing in
the Starr report that would justify
such an action. 0  L

BAS helps sluelenis build community

Christal Hall

Staff Writer

Black students aren’t graduating

on time because they are failing to.

live by the “four R’s” — righteous-
ness, representation, responsibility
and relationships.

This is according to Linwood
Harris, resident director of Lothrop
Hall and keynote speaker at the
Black Action Society’s 30th annual
Indaba celebration Friday night.

The Indaba is an informal dis-
cussion of issues affecting black
students’ academic success. A

Harris’ “four R’s” were among
the ideas presented to the nearly
450 people who attended the cele-
bration‘. ' A

“You aren’t righteous because
many of you walk around this cam-
pus without speaking to one anoth-

er,” Harris said.

Students tend to forget that they
represent their families based" on the
way that they act and carry them-
selves, he said.

“Your grandmother, mother and
ancestors are behind you,” Harris
said. “Is that they way you want to
portray them?”

Harris also said students think
that they are grown and don’t take
responsibility for their own lives.

“The relationships that you
establish while you’re in college
will help you to graduate,” Harris
said, “But first you must R.S.V.P.
[by following the four R’s].”

Friday’s celebration was
designed to help students avoid the
traps many black students run into
at Pitt. It was titled “Level 1” and
was meant to make the African—.
American community at Pitt better
than it was last year, said BAS pres-
ident Shavon Ogunleye. '

“In about two years, the people
who are at this podium won’t be
here,” said Ogunleye to students
during her opening speech. “And
we need someone to take our
places.” i

BAS needs to keep a stron
inﬂux of people and ideas in order
continue to serve Pitt’s black stu-
dents, Ogunleye said.

Harris advised students on how
to find their place in the.Pitt com-
munity without falling into the traps
that many African-Americans stu-
dents fall into.

“You’re in trouble with the sys-
tem you call higher education,” said
Harris.

Seventeen percent of black stu-
dents graduate from college, and 30
percent of those students graduate
in 5 to 6 years, according to Harris.

“This class [the class of ‘98] is
the best class in 24 years regarding

‘ where you rank in your class and

how well you did on the SATS, but
the statistics still aren’t changing,”
Harris said. “You’re still not gradu-
ating on time.”

Also, Justin Lang, of The
Village for an Afrikan Cultural
Center, spoke of his aspirations for
a cultural center so minority stu-
dents could have better access to
the Pitt community. ,

He said he hopes to build a rela-
tionship between the African-
American community and Pitt

through this cultural center. Lang
wants to establish study rooms and
libraries full of African history
books inside the center.

Darryl Wiley, president of My

Man Wear, told the students who
attended that he wanted to start an
entrepreneur club to teach members
how to run a successful business
with few mistakes.

Hackers slam LSU

FBI investigates computer break-ins

carrle Pagley
The Revellle

BATON ROUGE, La. (U-WlRE)—
Louisiana State University students experi-
encing problems with e-mail accounts and
Intemet access during the ﬁrst few weeks
of school may have computer hackers to
thank for it.

“We’re seeing all kind of hacker activ-
ity,” said Ronald Hay, executive director of
the Office of Computing Services.
“There’s a hell of a lot of nonsense going
on.”

During the ﬁrst two weeks of classes,
the University experienced problems with
Internet access and some e-mail accounts
due to hackers, Hay said ‘

“It’s not only om‘ site, but our Internet

‘ provider, Be1lSouth, has been having prob-

lems, too,” Hay said-.

Approximately 150 accounts were
compromised. The e-mail accounts that
experienced the problems were UNIXI
accounts, mostly held by graduate students
and faculty, said systems analyst Brian
Ropers-Huilman.

The hacked accounts belonged to stu-
dents who used easy-to-decipher pass-
words for logging in.

The initial intrusion-occurred at the
beginning of June. The hacker accessed
accounts allowing him to link to other
accounts, Ropers-Huilman said

“It took them to NASA, it took them to
Cornell, to IBM, Washington State,” he
said. And LSU was reﬂected as the place
where the intrusion was coming from.

“The repercussions of this person
intruding on our system [were] later in the
summer. We think this person took our
password ﬁle,” he said, “then apparently
posted the infonnation on the Internet
becausewehadarashofattacksinlate
summer, early fall.”

Some of the accounts intruded upon
had not been used frequently, Hay said

‘The. most attractive account is an
inactive account,” Hay said.

Although most of the intrusions were
not destructive, they were intrusive,
Ropers-Huilman said.

Hay attributes the increase in hacker

activity to the University’s rise in the

, national spotlight, due to the success of the

football and baseball teams.

When more people are taking notice of
a large group of computer users, that group
may become a target of hackers. -

“What we saw here this summer was a
rash of activity that was broader in scope
than we had ever seen,” Hay said.

The efforts to interrupt the
University’s services were the most persis-
tent during summer registration, he said.

‘They essentially brought our environ-
ment down,” Hay said.

An attack was used during registration
to overload the system,

Ropers-Huilman said.

“Somebody targeted us as well as the
University of Nebraska,” he said “Their
system went down, too. As far as I’m
aware, we have not had  [an] attack since
the fall semester has started.”_

When hacker activity is up, the
University increases its defenses, he said

The FBI was brought in to work with
the University on prosecuting some of the

- campus violations, Hay said.

“The FBI has formed a computer
crimes section in New Orleans for the ﬁrst
time,” Hay said.

Since June, the members of
Computing Services have met with the FBI
team to discuss legalities and prosecution.

“We were the ﬁrst university in the
Louisiana to meet with the computer
crimes division,” said Ropers-Huilman

Computing Services has been working
to ensure security for computer users since
these attacks.

“We’ve patched the security hole that
was exploited. Whenever we get a major
attack or when we get a lot of information
on small attacks, we turn this stuﬂ over to
the FBI,” he said.

ComputingServices has also installed
ﬁlters and other preventative measures,
Hay said, and have not experienced any
recent problems.

“We’re not having any serious prob-
lems as far as I know right now. We had a
whole rash of activity, but it’s calmed down
now,” Hay said. “Who knows, but tomor-
row’s a new day.”

TUERK

FROM PAGE 2

into its six—month administration of I

what is set to become one of the world’s
largest and most integrated economies,
Tuerk addressed the key issues _his
country will have to confront through-
out the remainder of its term.

The future of the euro as the com-
mon monetary unit for the Union was
the focal point of the discussion. Calling
the euro the “most prestigious, common
project of European integration,” Tuerk
dismissed the currency’s critics as being
too pessimistic. He said the euro not
only would have a positive affect on the
currencies in neighboring regions such
as North Aﬁica, it would also be a sta-
ble currency on which investors can

rely. - I

Tuerk said Austria also -must
address the 10.2-percent unemployment
rate in the union as well as the increas-
ing agitation surrounding immigrants.
He listed this as another reason Austria
should include such countries as Poland,
Estonia and Slovenia in the union. He
said their entrance would stimulate eco-
nomic and political reforms, cut down
on organized crime and the black mar-
ket, and decrease the likelihood of
member nations importing instability.

“What we have to do is try. to

« improve the living conditions in the

countries of Eastern Europe and
beyond,” Tuerk said. “But that’s easier
said than done.”

Pitt’s Center for ' West European
Studies, one of seven nationally funded
sites, ‘began working in May to bring
Tuerk to campus, said Michael Malloy,
the center’s associate director in charge
of graduate studies. '

“In order to enrich the educational

experience of students here at Pitt, they -

need to listen to major players in inter-
national affairs,” Malloy said. “It’s
important for students to gain an appre-
ciation for global interdependence and
to get excited about our world.”
Tuerk’s visit to Pitt fell right in line
with another of Austria’s many goals -
bettering the European Union’s relation-

 

ship with the United States.
, “Economists are always talking
about the Asian tigers, and they may be
right,” Tuerk said. “But they have for-
gotten one other tiger - the European
Union.” ‘

Encouraging cooperation among
member nations beyond the economy
into such areas as the environment,

Helmut Tuerk; Austrian ambassador

small-arms control, and development of
a common foreign policy for the union
were other issues Tuerk said must be
resolved.

“Henry Kissinger was once quoted
as saying, ‘If you want to contact the
European counterpart to the United
States, you do not know whom to call,’”
said T‘uerk. _

Austria’s response to this confusion
is the creation of a solid European
Union front that would better be able to
deal with the recent economic recession
in Russia and the Kosovo problem,
referred to by T‘11erk as “the most press-
ing foreign policy problem of the
moment.”

In Kosovo, a part of the volatile
Balkan area near the Mediterranean,
Albanian rebels are ﬁghting against
Serbian military forces in_ an effort to
gain control of an area they consider

their homeland. About 90 percent of the
people in the area are ethnic Albanians,
while 10 percent are of Serbian nation-
ality.

Tuerk’s campus visit inspired much
thought and conversation not only
among students, but also among Pitt’s
attending administrators.

“I got a much greater sense of the
European Union’s engagement and con-
cern over the crisis in Russia,” Cooper
said. A

He called the visit a responsibility
that Pitt has to share its resources with
students in the whole tri-state region of
Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia.

Students from Pitt’s J ohnstown
campus, Washington and Jefferson
University and Chatham College attend-
ed the lecture.

“The ambassador’s talk mainly cen-
tered on economic development, and
anytime that happens, you have to won-
der how the environment is being affect-
ed,” said John Wojnarowski, a ﬁfth year
Pitt-Oakland student, referring to a
question he asked about water pollution
in Europe. “He dodged the bullet a little
bit, but he did say that Austria has high-
er standards than many of the members

and is looking to raise the standards dur-

ing its presidency.” '

Wojnarowski, a political science
and history major, is currently taking a
class covering European environmental
policy, and Tuerk’s visit gave ‘him an
opportunity to ask a question of some-
one involved in European policy.

It’s this type of interaction between
students and international ﬁgures that
the European Union Center will help to
make possible, said Malloy. -

With additional national funding,‘

new courses can be developed, larger
international conferences planned, and
more speakers like Tuerk hosted.

All this beneﬁts the students.

“Students may not remember what
the ambassador said specifically,”
Malloy said. “They will remember,
however, that they heard the Austrian
ambassador speak and that they could

- stand up, and ask him questions, and

that’s where it all starts.”

NEW Housme

However, Council member Jim Ferlo raised concerns
about the impact the new housing will have on Oakland
landlords. Ferlo said he worried students would forsake com-
mercial apartments in favor of University-owned housing.

Jerome Cochran, assistant chancellor for business and
administration, suggested local landlords could easily appeal
to young faculty and graduate students by improving the
quality of available apartments. ‘

Pitt eventually wants to guarantee all students four years
of on-campus housing. - '

James Holland, a member of the Faculty Senate,
endorsed the proposed new housing.

“I’ve lived in Oakland for 19 years,” he said “I support
this plan as a resident. The record of the University cleaning
up the street is excellent. Forbes Avenue in front of the law
school is always clean. The rest of the business area looks

like a dump, but that is not University property. Getting the
students into these apartments is ideal.” -
In order for Pitt to build the new housing, the University
will have to demolish several houses, a plan the Oakland
Community Council denounced
“[We] 'don’t support the removal of existing structures

' for something new,” said a representative.

Pitt has designed the proposed housing to resemble sur-
rounding buildings. The ﬁrst two levels of the complex will
be brick, but the upper ﬂoors will have vinyl siding.

Saturday, Pitt held an open house for the Oakland com-
munity to ask questions and express concerns about the
University’s plans. Pitt police addressed parking concerns,
explaining that parking will be available in the Towers View

V garage and eventually in Panther Hollow. Pitt displayed a

model of the planned convocation center, projections for the
planned multipurpose academic complex, and pictures of the
housing plans. . .

The housing strategy, which is part of a 10-year facilities

plan, calls for the addition of 400 beds over a two-year peri-
od, broken down into three phases. -

Ifapproved, the ﬁrst phase will make l92beds available
for September 1999. .

The garden-style apartments will cost $5.3 million to
build, and upperclassmen will receive priority in selecting
them.

Therewillbeascreeningprocessforadmittancetothe
new residence halls. Academic performance and past records
of behavioral problems will be taken into consideration.

“New housing will be for tmdergraduates, but we virtu-
ally guarantee it to be upperclassmen,” said Cochran

Pitt feels students will also be drawn to the design of the
apartments since upperclassmen prefer the space apartments
offer. .

“Students have no desire to live in dormitories with
bathrooms in the hall,” Cochran said ‘They want their own
bedroom, private bath, and living room. They want to be
adults.” '

Impeachment: the only course
of action for Congress

In his report to Congress,
independent counsel Kenneth
Starr has ‘substantial and credi-
ble_ evidence ‘ supporting ll
grounds for the impeachment of
President Clinton. _ .

_ These include. Clinton’s
lying under oath, obstruction of
justice, improperly tampering‘
with a ‘ potential witness,
endeavoring to obstruct justice,
and abusing his constitutional
authority.

For all these, Clinton should
be impeached.

The sex act itself (though
the term. “sexual relations” has
been bent by Clinton’s attor-
neys in an attempt to escape the
allegation of lying under oath)
is not the crime: It’s Clinton’s

- lying, hiding evidence, and

manipulating others in an
attempt to keep it under wraps.

Everyone remembers
Clinton saying in January, “I
did not have sexual relations
with that woman, Ms.
Lewinsky.” But on Aug. 17, he
announced he had an “improper

relationship” with her. Even ~ ‘

with legal jargon, it will be dif-
ficult for him to get away with

lying under oath. -

. The allegation _ that he
abused his constitutional power‘,

will be the one that sticks. By“

using his staff and aides to con-
ceal the relationship and even
to organize his rendezvous
 with Lewinsky, the
“improper relationship” tran-
scends his personal life. He got

-other people -involved,; and he

asked them to lie under "oath,
w-inch is, even by legal defini-
tion, an obstruction of justice.
The White House rebuttal,
composed by Clinton’s lawyers,
insists that Clinton is ‘by’ no

means guilty of lying, obstruct-

ing justice Or abusing power.
However, the foundation‘ of
their defense is very shaky.
They’ll have to pull off another
obstruction of justice, or be
extra sharp with their legal
terms, to save him.

Clinton should be removed
from office, justso the normal
day-to-day operations of the
White House can be performed
efficiently. His credibility,
which is tied to that of the coun-
try he represents, has been
severely undermined by his
inability to act responsibly.
Though not everyone agrees
Vice President Al Gore isrquite
up to the task of being presi-
dent, he would certainly be a
better than a president bogged

‘down by an ongoing sex scan-

dal.'—

    President Clinton soulcl resign

Sen. Joseph Lieberman recently I gave a
speech on the ﬂoor of the U.S. Senate concent-

ing Piesident Clinton’s admission thathe had an‘
' “improper” relationship with Monica Lewinsky.‘

Unlike the Republicans who barely conceal
theirlusttoimpeachthismanwhomtheyso
passionately despise, Lieberman epitomizes

evcaything that a U.S. senator ought to be: an

intellectiialwhocandeliberateoverthefactsin

a calm and judicious manner, nearly always -

arriving at a resolutely fair conclusion. _ In his
speech, Lieberman said some things that
Democrats have been thinking for a whileabout
this mess.

In the beginning of his speech, Lieberman
remarked: “The president is not just the elected

, leader of our country. He is, as presidential
' scholar Clinton Rossiter observed, ‘the one-man

distillation of the American people’ and,’ as
President Taft said at another time, .‘the person-
al embodiment and representative of their digni-
ty and majesty.’” .

Mulling over Lieberman’s speech, I came
to the conclusion that hewas proba-
bly cofrect. Clinton’s behavior in
this: 4‘ inatter has done devastating
damage to the office of the presiden-
cy. Peijury andiadultery by a sitting
president (especially one who has already been
caught performing the latter) is, at the very least,
problematic. '

“Such behavior is not only inappropriate,”

- Liebemian argued in his speech, “it is immoral,

and it is harmful.” Indeed, Clinton’s conduct has
gone well beyond the pale.

Over the last year, the Lewinsky scandal
has had a debilitating effect upon our govem-
merit. There is a tremendous amount of work to
be done in Washington on issues like Social
Security reform, the environment, trade, and tax
reform. A major campaign ﬁnance bill is pend-
ing before the Senate. Instead of getting down to
business, Congress has spent the last eight
months obsessing over the details of the presi-
dent’s sex life. .

The Lewinsky scandal has also inhibited
Clinton’s ability to perform his role as comman-
der in chief. The president’s credibility has been
utterly shattered with the American people and
with foreign leaders. The dimwitted speculation
that our recent missile strikes against terrorist

camps in.Sudan and Afghanistan are an attempt: _j
(a la the ﬁlm “Wag the Dog”) by President
Clinton to divert attention from his personal life.

_is a telling example of how this scandalhas

It is worth noting that over the last year we
have seen ‘Saddam Hussein repeatedly strong-

nuclear weapons programs continue. Pakistan
and India luiched unexpectedly toward-nuclear
cold war. The Middle East peace process has

almost entirely broken down. We have seen a '

rise in terrorist activity. Wltll the president so
obviously unable to focus his energy on his
duties, the disturbing question of whether
Ameiica’s national secinity has been put in
jeopardy must be raised. '
Personally, I felt no sense of betrayal when
Clinton admitted to having an affair with
Lewinksy. When he denied in
January having sex with her, I didn’t

However, after several months of

COLUMMST the scandal, Ihave gotten pretty ini-

tated (as my fiiends can attest) Simply having to
talk about it in every conversation I have is
dispiriting. After all, I didn.’ t get interested in
politics to spend all day speculating about the
president’s sex life. Also, as a Democrat, -I am
more than a little peeved that because Clinton
couldn’t keep his libido in check ,the party will
almost assuredly lose ground in the 1998 elec-
tion. Will Congressman So—and-So lose the
election because he is unqualiﬁed? Nope, he
will lose because the president lied about having
an affair with an intern. .,

Clinton is a man whom I admired for his
skills as a politician and for his liberal-centrist
approach to government, but my passions are
for ideas and theories, not individuals.

Therefore, I carmot say that I am entirely
sad to have to arrive at this conclusion: Clinton
should resign for the good of the party and for
the good of the country. America would be safer
and could fimction much better with Al Gore
occupying the White House. It is a shame it had
to come to this. '

It appears ‘ that one William
Jefferson Clinton is in a lot of trouble.
The Ofﬁce of Independent Counsel has
presented 11 possible grounds for his
impeachment, one of which is endeav-

_ oring to obstruct justice.

I understand the legalities of that
particular charge, though I always find

A it humorous that the effort is as much a

sin as the actual deed. Being an accom-
plice to shoplifting and attempted van-
dalism are another two.

I always wonder if Kenneth Starr’s
mother ever caught little Kenny mastur-
bating under the sheets when she
walked into his room to read him a bed-
time stofy (“Curious George Goes to
Washington to Get the President’s Ass
Impeached”). '

“What are you doing Kenny?!”
shrieks Mrs. Starr.

“Er, nothing, Ma, nothing at all,”
protests Kenneth. A

“You’d better not be lying to me, or A

endeavoring to lie! If you’re going to
grow up to be like your hero Juan de
Torquemada, you’re going to have to
learn not to endeavor to obstruct justice
and to investigate those who do.”

And the “Poor Snookums of the
Week Award” ‘goes to  Pittsburgh
Post—Gazette columnist Barbara Cloud.

In her column in yesterday’s
Magazine section, she complains that
there are too many trees along Forbes

Avenue in Squirrel Hill and that deviant
Greeks had a pig—on—a—spit barbecue
outside the fraternity houses on
University Drive in full view of the 67F
bus passengers.

, Those trees are starting to piss me
off, too. They just sit, vegetating and
photosynthesizing. Bastards. Someone
should cut them down. Cloud says that

they’re an accident waiting to happen »

verge of victory).

Representatives from Angola,
Zimbabwe, South Africa, Uganda and

Recruiting goes
farther than the

Joe Moorhead isn’ t the answer.
Joe is a guy in my sports writing class.

He’s a grad student, trying to ﬁll armoying _

requirements just like everybody else.

But Joe is part of the answer. Aforrner
high school quarterback at Pittsburgh
Central Catholic who continued his playing
career at Fordham University, he is now a
part of Pitt’s recruiting staﬂ. ‘

That makes him part of the answer.

The question: How can Pitt beat Penn

A State repeatedly for a long, long time?

Saturday’s game is being over—hyped
That much is, certain.

Pitt will likely lose. That much, while
noonewilladmitit,tl1ankstoamixtureof
school pride, denial and pre-pre-pregarne

' alcohol, is also certain.

Penn State comes into this battle
with a legendary coach, a pristine rural

campus and a tradition of excellence, both

recently and historically.

Until last year, Pitt came in with an old
stadium and a promise of playing time. lots
and lots of playing time, -with players who

‘_ lacked experience, talent, or both experi-

ence and talent.

Walt Harris has changed that. Joe will
help to change it even more, as will the
other changes that the Panthers have made
to improve their recruiting process.

Instead of showing off seasons of sor-
row, Hanis brings with him a miracle 1997
season. Instead of promising playing time

on abad team, the coach can  p1ay- .

ing time with a number of proven stars —
Phil Clarke, Terry Murphy and the like.
That could lead to postseason contests.
Instead of showing olf an old turf stadi-
um, Harris‘ can show oﬂ  well, never
mind   S
. But until this season, recruits who visit-
ed Pitt games didn’t even get to see the ﬁeld.
All promising high school youngsters
were kept in a conference room during the
contest, not able to experience the arena

they could grace or the fans who could .
. cheer them on.

This season, the white tent that brought
confusion from fans at the Villanova game
plays host to these special high schoolers;

' Looking for student tickets for the
big game on Saturday? Too bad. As of
Thursday, they were sold out. ‘

But you might not be out of luck yet
because Pitt students have one more
chance to get the highly sought tickets.
Pitt Athletics Director Steve Pederson
armounced Thursday that 853 more stu-
dent season-ticket packages will go on

T sale at 8 a.m. today in the William Pitt

Union ticket ofﬁce.

’ For Saturday’s Penn State game,
these tickets will be in section 10, which
is not usually the student section. For the
remainder of the season, they will be
general-admission tickets in the regular
student section because. those games
won’t draw as big a crowd as Penn State
will.

“I felt like this was something nice
we could do for the students,” Pederson
said of the additional tickets._ “I don’t
want to shut out anybody, so we are
going to take care of 853 more students.”

The ticket ofﬁce has sold 7,100 stu- *

dent season-ticket packages and has also
sold 2,900 individual student tickets for
the Penn State game; taking care of all
10,000 student tickets allotted for that
game.

Pederson took the extra allotment of

student tickets from the already sm
quantity _. of general-public tickets that
remain for the game. As a result, the

number of general-public tickets remain-

ing is a mere 1,500, meaning a sellout is
almost certain. ,

The Pitt record for student season
tickets sold in one year is about 8,200,
which happened in the early ‘80s, when
Dan Marino played here. In the past,
there were roughly 10,000 student tick-
ets per game, but 8,200 were allotted for

6 season sales, as opposed to this year’s

7,100.

It was originally hoped Pitt would
shatter the record this year, but because
of a miscommunication within the ticket
ofﬁce, only the 7,100 student season
packages were allotted. There are still
10,000 student tickets for each game, but
the remaining tickets are sold on an indi-
vidual-game basis. ‘

The Penn State game is expected to
draw the Panthers’ largest home crowd
in recent memory. When asked about the
rumors of the game possibly having the
largest crowd in Pitt Stadium history,
Media Relations Director E.J. Borghetti
said that it wouldn’t be possible. ‘He

’ explained that, due to reconstruction of

the‘ stadium, -the crowds the Panthers .
drew in the 1930s could not be seen
again.

Pederson said he was especially
pleased with the crowd of 36,154 for the
season opener against Villanova.

“That was one of the better opening-
day crowds we have had for awhile,” he
said.

Pederson hopes the crowd is indica-
tive of high attendance for the rest of the
season. Attendance at home games last
year averaged 39,710 per game, a jump

Women's soccer winstwo overweekend

Megan McDonald

' For The Pltt News

The Pitt women’s soccer team

, won two gamesover the weekend,

its best weekend since coming into

« existence just two years ago.

Pitt 11, Wagner 1

The Pitt women’s soccer team
scored only seven goals last season.
On Friday alone, however, the
Lady Panthers scored 11 times,‘
beating Wagner College, 11-1.

Wagner’s Kathy Zufall opened
the scoring with a free—kick goal at
the 12:56 mark of the first half, but
Wagner’s lead was short-lived.
Pitt’s Cande Ruiz scored the first of
her three goals about three minutes
later. _

Her second goal came at the
3:35 mark of the second half, after
her head met a high cross pass from
Charity McClure, who recorded an
assist on the goal. ,

McClure, who had three goals

and two assists in the game, scored
with an assist from Ruiz to put the
Panthers up 3-1.

Pitt’s Anya Bohun—Chudyniv
also had two goals and an assist,
while Renee Spampinato had a goal
and_two assists. '

The victory continued Pitt’s
surprising success this season,
improving its record to 2-2.

Pitt 4, St.John’s 3

Fresh off Saturd-ay’s big win,
the Lady ‘Panthers’ record contin-
ued to climb after they upset St.

.John’s on Sunday with a 4-3 victo-

ry.
After stealing the .ball, Kara
Kunkle opened the scoring with a
breakaway goal at 18:46 in the first
half. ' .
Pitt remained on top until the
very end of the first half, when St.
John’s scored back-to-back goals at
42:45 and 43:01.
The Panthers came back quick-
ly to tie the game in the second

half, when Charity McClure
slipped past the Red Storm defense

to assist a goal by Patricia Bradley

at the 50:31 mark. .

St. John’s took the lead five
minutes later with a 50-yard break-
away by Kristy Bergen, who sent
the ball ‘ to forward Lisa
Cabesciberta for a goal.

,McC1ure scored the final two
goals, her first at 64:15 on an assist
from Lori Krzeszewski, and the
game winner at 71:33 on an assist
from Bradley. : A

The win gave the Panthers their
first "winning record.

After winning just three’ games
last year, the team has put together
an impressive 3-2 record so far,
with the losses coming against
nationally ranked foes.

Fans can watch the Panthers
when they take on ' Villanova at

7:15 p.m. Friday in Pitt. Stadium.

The team then plays Rutgers at 1

I’ve. always admired police ofﬁcers.
They put their lives on the line to “serve and

would deﬁnitely abuse my power.

a cool Saturday in late September, the leaves
have started to fall, and there’s a buzz of foot-
ball in the air. »

I’m a Pemisylvania state trooper, and
I’m a little bit pissy because I’m on duty,
patrolling the highways in middle—of—

ting in Pitt Stadium watching my Panthers.

patrol car behind a billboard along Interstate »

80 and wait for an unsuspecting Speedster to
break the 65-mph speed limit.

All ofa sudden, Inotice a car zoom by
me at 66 mph. Normally I wouldn’t ﬂinch,
but this car is decked out with Penn State
paraphernalia

It’s got a Penn State ﬂag ﬂuttering out
the window and Nittany Lion stickers on the
rear windows. ,

Immediately, my sirens scream on, and
I tear out onto the road in pursuit

As I close in, I notice four adults, totally

Delta Sigma Phi passes
all the way l

Laura Loner

For The Pltt News

‘ The brothers of Delta Sigma Phi
recently held a Pass—A-Thon to
raise money for underprivileged
youths. ,

“This event showed how serious
we are with our commitment to the
community, as well as allowing our
brothers a chance to take part in
something special,” said Matt
Milazzo, Delta Sigma Phi fraternity
president. ‘

The event raised money for the

yMel Blount Youth Home, a private,

nonprofit youth and family treat-
ment agency.

I The organization helps high-risk
families that have problems with
drugs, alcohol, runaways, truancy,
and physical and sexual abuse.

‘ This charity is run by founder
Mel Blount, a former Steeler defen-
sive back who played on the cham-
pionship teams of the ‘70s and early
‘80s.

The Pass—A-Thon started" on
Pitt’s campus at the William Pitt
Union. Blount threw the first pass,
and it continued through Pittsburgh.

The 15 fraternity brothers who

H-EullﬂilljjiIjdljjilﬁjlljjiljﬁlljMII“II_—II_jDIj‘UljjIIjjIlm

0 Canton

participated in the fund-raising
event threw impromptu passes from
one to another throughout the city.
One brother carried the ball, for a
while andthen yelled to another,
“Go out for a long one!”

The ball was also passed
through three Ohio towns —— Salem,
Alliance and Mussilion — and the
National Football League’s_ Hall of
Fame in Canton, Ohio.

Blount was to- catch the final

pass but was unable to do so due to
a personal conﬂict. .
Prior to the event, the fraternity

brothers visited the Mel Blount’

Youth Home, a 260-acre“ farm in
Washington, Pa.

The residents‘ of the home gen-
erally spend 9 months there, attend-
ing local schools, Bible studies, and
physical training and working the
farm while learning a new way of
life.

Delta Sigma Phi raised $1,200
for the home.

Brother Nick Somogyi said,
“We were pleased with how every-
thing turned out. It was a way we
felt we could help the community,
and [it was] a great brotherhood
event.” ' ’

Men's soccer wins one
game and lies another

Pitt won one game against Robert
Morris and tied another against Notre
Dame to start its Big East schedule.

Pitt 7, Robert Morris 3.

The Pitt men’s soccer team defeat-
ed Robert Morris College by a score
of 7-3 last week. «

Sophomore Chad Porter scored
two goals on four shots, ‘and sopho-
more Reagan Bender scored one goal
on seven shots. -

Other contributors to the
Panthers’ victory included senior Phil
Matilla, who added one goal and one
assist on five shots; sophomore
Spencer Barton, who netted one goal
with two assists; and freshman Mark
Sikora, who assisted a goal.

Tim Montgomery opened the
scoring for the Panthers with a goal 1.1
minutes into the first half. ‘Robert
Morris answered with two goals of its
own before Porter and Barton put Pitt
back in the lead. .

Robert Morris scored its last goal
40 minutes into the first half, but
Bender answered for the Panthers in
the waning seconds of the first half.

W Pitt scored three more in the sec-
ond half to give itself a nice cushion.

The Panthers registered 25 shots on

Robert Morris goalkeeper Matt

Henson, who made 18 saves.
Freshman goalkeeper Mike Norris

turned away four of seven Robert

Morris shots to earn the Panther victo-

ry. * .

—Jamel Idriss For The Pitt News

Pitt 2, Notre Dame 2
The Pitt men’s soccer team kept
its unbeaten streak alive yesterday in a

2-2 double—overtime draw against the _

Fighting Irish of Notre Dame.
The first Panther goal came in the
14th minute of the first period, when

Drew Kopp scored unassisted, kicking ‘

a 10-yard shot over the head of
Fighting Irish goalkeeper Greg Velho.

Notre Dame’s ‘Shane Walton
answered Pitt in the 19th minute,
knotting the game at 1 with a goal
from inside the penalty area.

Ten minutes later, Irish forward
Ryan Cox scored the go-ahead goal to
put his team ahead of the Panthers, 2-
1.

The final score of the evening and
the eventual game-tying goal came on
a Kopp header in the 33rd minute of
the ﬁrst period. Matilla got credited

lowing a childhood dream to Notre Dame or
Florida.

Penn State has robbed the Panthers of
an impressive stable:

McKeesport’s Brandon Short.

LaVar Arrington from the North Hills. _

Offensive lineman Ryan Fagan from

FROM PAGE 10

North Allegheny High.

Aaron Gatten from Washington, Pa.

Justin Kurpeikis, a 6-foot—4—inch, 247-
pound backup defensive end who attended
Pittsburgh Central Catholic.

That’s Joe’s alrna matter. While Joe
can’t recruit talent directly due to NCAA
regulations, he will provide Recruiting
Director. Curt Cignetti with another irnpor—
tant local link A

He’ll also provide him with time, han-
dling administrative paperwork while
Cignetti visits the players, schmoozes the
parents, and tries to gloss over that whole

less-than-pristine campus thing.

Tents and graduate assistants might
sound like nothing, but they mark an irnpor—
tant start of rebuilding a recruiting program
that could slowly retake the Panther home-
land I

An impressive showing Saturday could
move that program forward about ﬁve
years. Nothing would please Cignetti and
Moorhead better than playing Penn State
tough in front of a tent of recruits who might
think, “Hey, I could make a difference.”

They can make a diﬂerence.

Penn State may be really, really good
now, but after losing a few more Wrlliamses
and Purifoys, that can change in a hurry.

And next time the Nits visit, it won’t
take school spirit or denial to predict a Pitt
victory. .

As for the pregame alcohol  well,
recruiting isn’t everything.

The Panthers’ dramatic 1997 season,
an even bigger advertising campaign and
the exciting family-event-like atmos-
phere now in place at home games have
all increased interest in this year’s foot-

And judging by the increased season
ticket sales to both students and the gen-
