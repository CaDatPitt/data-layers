Pitt students like Jane Wallis are dependent un
computers to do homework. Can this trend go too far?

Professors divided
over internet reliability

,.Z.*.39*!<_='i°*' 3'93.

 

Students looking for research sources often turn to
the internet, but some college professors are divided in
accepting internet material due to its potential unrelia-
bility.

David Wilkins, a professor in the history of art and
architecture department, is a strong proponent of inter-
net research. He requires his students to use at least one
internet source on research papers.

“I offer extra credit to my grad students for using
multiple sites on the web, also,” said Wilkins.

His wife, an archeology professor at Duquesne,
requires her students to use at least two sites for all
papers. .

Wilkins advocates the internet saying it is “excep—
tionally valuable in the fields of art and archeology”
because the most recent information and pictures are
there first.

“For example, in December of 1995, there were new
prehistoric paintings found in a cave in France. Photos
of the paintings were on the net in six weeks,” said
Wilkins.

Katheryn Linduff, another professor in the history of
art and architecture department, agrees that the internet
is a great source of research information for students in

Black History Month

A time for reflection, culture, and learning

TAli R Abd_u_llah

   

4' -:,.»t-



Black History Month is a celebra-
tion unlike any other. There are no
gifts exchanged, parades held, or
fireworks displayed, but for many
African Americans, the month of
February has a deep sentimentality
rooted in triumph and tragedy span-
ning hundreds of years.

Black History Month recognizes
the struggles of African Americans
during their trials of slavery, tri-
umphs for civil rights, and contribu-
tions to American society over the
past 400 years.

It’s a month for reflection, and
there are as many different ways of
looking at it as there are years of his-
tory.

Celebrating Black History Month
to many Pitt students means having
an appreciation for culture. The
appreciation many feel centers on

African American culture, but
encompasses all American cultures
and how they’ve interacted in soci-
ety.

Historically, the struggles, contri-
butions, and achievements of African
Americans have shaped their lives as
well as the lives of every American
living today.

That’s what Janera Solomon,
president of the Black Action
Society, says. “Black History Month
should be recognized because it’s our
history as Americans. It’s [every
American’s] history as well as it is
mine,” said Solomon.

Black History Month is essential
to recognize this, according to
Student Government Board member
Christa Douaihy. “I think without 
Black History Month, it would be
detrimental to students and the
morale of African Americans,” she
said.

Researchers at
Muscular Dystrophy Center at Pitt are
trying to understand the biology and
pathology of Duchenne muscular dys-
trophy by researching muscle and blood
samples of diagnosed patients so a cure
can be found.

Dr. Eric Hoffman, an associate pro-
fessor at the Departments of Molecular
Genetics and Biochemistry, Neurology,
Pediauics and Human Genetics, is the
director of the lab, with 20 other people
researching along with him.

“We look at the speciﬁc genes and
proteins in muscle and blood samples of
people from all over the world. We can
tell exactly what’s wrong with the gene

ally have the disease. The sad part is that
at the moment, muscular dystrophy is an
incurable disease, which commonly
means death for the victim.

Muscular dystrophy is a group of
hereditary diseases that destroys the
muscles. Even though females do not
manifest the disease, they transmit the
gene that canies the disease to half of
their sons and half of their daughters,
who then become carriers.

A child with muscular dystrophy
doesn’t have much of a chance for a nor-
mal physical life. Duchenne muscular
dystrophy, the most common variety,
causes difficulty in walking at about the
age of four, the loss of the ability to walk
at the age of 11, and the patient usually
dies by the age of 20, frequently due to
respiratory failure.

The clinic studies dogs infected
with muscular dystrophy and sends the
muscle and blood samples to the labs at
Pitt so researchers can study the differ-
ent kinds of muscular dystrophy.

History 

With the exception of the events
sponsored by the Black Action
Society, many Pitt students say there
are few things being done here at the
University for Black History Month.

Sean K. Stallings is the chairper-
son of the Black Active Students
Intercollegiate Struggle, a committee
of BAS focusing on uniting black
students at Pitt with other schools for
African American events.

He says Pitt relies too heavily on
the BAS to initiate programs for
Black History Month, and doesn’t do
enough on its own to commemorate
the event.

“I think they [the University] just
depend on BAS to put on something
every year,” Stallings said.

Pitt student‘ Anita Pytlarz agreed.
She said celebrating Black History
Month is a good thing because it
helps increase cultural awareness.

At many universities and in the
city of Pittsburgh, non—European hol-
idays have not been stressed to an
outstanding degree, she said.

Although, many businesses rec-
ognize Black History Month many
Pitt students say corporations are
insincere.

“Businesses advertising for
Black History Month do so strictly
with the expectation -of benefiting
themselves financially,” says
Courtney Chisholm, chairperson for
the programming committee for
BAS.

Lassain Robinson, a member of
the BAS, also claims that most busi-
nesses only recognize Black History
Month to look politically correct.

But even the negative aspects
surrounding the commemoration can-
not overshadow the positive message
of Black History Month.

Many say the main purpose for
establishing Black History Month
was to teach non—educated African
Americans about themselves and to
instill self—pride.

The history of the commemora-
tion is interesting in itself.

Initially, five decades before
being commemorated by the govern-
ment for the nation’s bicentennial,
Black History Month started out as
“Negro History Week.”

“Negro History Week” was estab-
lished in 1926 during the second
week of February by Carter G.
Woodson.

Woodson chose the second week
of the month because he felt
Frederick Douglass and Abraham
Lincoln had the most influence on

FROM PAGE I

African-American people.

Three years after becoming the
first African American to receive a
doctorate degree in 1912, Woodson
established the Association for the
Study of Negro Life and History.
Today, Woodson is known as the
“Father of Black History” for his
contributions to and recognition of
African American history.

Pitt’s BAS will continue the tra-
dition this year, hosting several
events throughout February. They
started the month with a celebration
and reception in the William Pitt
Union, featuring a gospel choir and
readings for a poetry forum.

On February 4, Civil Rights
Activist Judy Richardson lectured on
the topics dealing with the Civil
Rights Movement.

“That was the first time I had
heard Rosa Parks had been arrested
on more than one occasion for refus-
ing to give up her seat. Miss
Richardson said once she was report-
ed by the same bus driver but only
arrested the second time,” said Sean
Stallings. ’

Other events sponsored by BAS.

will include a Valentine dinner for
the homeless, today at 5 p.m. at
Macedonian Church in the Hill
District.

The premiere event for Black
History Month is the African
American Leadership Conference.

The conference will begin Friday,
Feb. 14, and conclude on Sunday,
Feb. 16. The theme of the conference
will be “Bridging the Gap Between
Us,” and the keynote speaker will be
Dr. Ivan Van Sertima, professor of
African studies at Rutgers University.

The conference will showcase
several discussion forums, perfor-
mances by the Black Dance
Workshop, Steel Impressions (a steel
drum band), and a number of speak-
ers.

Finally, on the Feb. 28, starting at
10 a.m., the BAS is sponsoring a
Black Bazaar which will be held in
Forbes Quad Galleria. The Bazaar
will include many vendors from the
Pittsburgh area and others from
across the nation.

As the month concludes, the
memories stay strong. If anything is
accomplished, the BAS hopes it is
not only a better sense of history, but
unity as well.

“Students should attend these
events because [they’ll] learn more
about [themselves],” says Lassain
Robinson, a member of the BAS.

Staff Writers must attend a meeting today at 5
p.m. in The Pitt News office. If you can not

attend, notify the editors.

all classes. ,

“Yes, it’s va1uable,” said Linduff.
“It’s a place where they can find info
quickly that’s not in other forms.”

Linduff also agrees that the inter-
net is especially important to art and
architecture students. A

“It offers good visual info that’s
current. I have my students look
through museums’ pages that contain
good color pictures that you can’t
always get somewhere else,” she
said.

However, not all teachers are
ready to support the internet for stu-
dent research. ’

Martin Bartness, a teaching fel-

low in communications, sees the

internet as a valid source of informa-
tion, but questions the authenticity of
all the sites.

“It’s hard to accurately judge if a
site is authentic or not,” said
Bartness. “If it’s in print, you can rest
assured you know who it’s really
from.”

Bartness also said the internet
deteriorates students research skills.

“Students are losing research
skills,” he said. “Many faculty
restrict students to the net, and I feel
this moves [students] away from the
old ways. We need to hold onto the
value o_f book research.”

Other teachers say students just
need to be careful when surfing the

THE PITT NEWS

 

internet for information.

Richard Moreland, a professor of
the psychology department, encour-
ages researching websites but warns
that personal homepages are easy to
create and may be a mixture of fact
and opinion. i A

“If it’s a site sponsored by a col-
lege organization, I have more faith
in it than a [personal] homepage,”
said Moreland.

Linduff adds that sorting infor-
mation is a large part of research. She
points out that sorting internet infor-
mation “is the same as sorting
library—based research.”

“In both [library and internet
research], students need to learn
where the good sources and authors
are,” said Linduff.

Students also have mixed views
about internet research. Senior
Christopher Swain thinks the internet
is a valuable source for large amounts
of specific information. But he added
that source reliability may be ques-
tionable because it could be tainted
by opinion.

Junior Harold Turner says he
never came across information he
later discovered was false. He says
that as long as a student credits the
information, it is enough.

“I can’t see any reason,” said
Turner, “that we should have any
restrictions on [the internet’s] use.”

the most common type of muscular dys-
trophy. It is found in 50% to 70% of the
diagnoses. There are dozens of different
types of muscular dystrophy, causing
different types of muscle degeneration.
Right now we’re focusing our research
on eight of the different types,” said
Hoffman. ,

While doctors look at patients and
diagnose them from their symptoms, the
Duchenne muscular dystrophy center
studies a patient’s muscle or blood and
can speciﬁcally tell what is wrong with
him.

“With some of the diseases we

look, at the best way to tell what’s _

wrong is to look at the genes,” said
Hoffman. ‘

He added that there are a number of
tests that only the labs at Pitt are able to
do. This makes Pitt the last stop for
many samples. Pitt receives the samples
from researchers who could not deter-
mine the disease’s cause.

The research center at Pitt has six
labs researching muscular dystrophy
and, because diseases that are common
in humans are also common in animals,
the center works in collaboration with.
the Dog Clinical Trial Unit at the
University of Missouri. ,

. According to Hoffman, the Pitt labs
are relatively unique because they not
only look for what’s causing the disease,
they also do research to ﬁnd a cure.
Even though he doesn’t know when it

will come, he believes there will be one.

“We’l1 eventually ﬁnd a cure. It’s
difficult to give a time table because you
never know what kind of major baniers
you’ll come up against. We know what
some of the barriers are, but we still
haven’t found them all,” said Hoffman.

Previous researchers have found
ways to prolong the life of patients with
muscular dystrophy. Because their
mental capacities are unaffected and
their speech ability is the last function to
be affected, the patients can live longer
on artiﬁcial life support in a mobile
electronic wheelchair.

Researchers also discovered that
the use of steroids can brieﬂy prolong a
patient’s life.

The Duchenne muscular dystrophy
center also works in collaboration with
the Parent Project For Muscular
Dystrophy Research, Inc., a nonproﬁt
organization of concerned parents. Last
May, the Duchenne muscular dystrophy
center had 200 parents of children with
muscular dystrophy visit Pitt for the
weekend. The researchers gave the par-
ents a tour of the lab and demonstrated
the work that is being done.

Hoffman believes one positive in
the ﬁght against muscular dystrophy is
the pace at which the research is going.

“I think we’re moving pretty quick
in our research. With the ﬁndings we’ve
made we’re more encouraged now than
we were two years ago,” he said.

Have research to do?
Stick to the library

The intemet  it’s fun to look for information on
your favorite rock stars and to look up nudie sites, but is
it reliable enough to use for academic research?

We think not. Anybody and his brother (or sister,
whichever you prefer) can post on the intemet. There is
no regulatory standard for measuring the factuality of the
information you receive while surﬁng the Net. Why
waste your time on inaccurate information when the real
stuff is right at your ﬁngertips? ‘

One of the problems with today’s society is that we
are too busy searching for a new and improved method
when the best method is already at our disposal. Need to
do research? Duh, go to the library. The most reliable
forms of research material are accredited books and jour-
nals. The many research facilities at Pitt are excellent.
Just ask any student at CMU who opts to come here and
use our libraries rather than the pitiful excuses they have
for libraries.

If for some reason, you are required to look up mate-
rial on the intemet‘ for a class assignment, weigh the
source. There are those sources which are credible such
as those which are posted by universities and credible
organizations, such as our own The Pitt Newslink or the
Metropolitan Museum of Art. Do not trust anything you
read on a homepage. Remember, for all you know, the
world’s worst pathological liar may have posted it.

Yes, there is a lot of information available on the
intemet. Yes, it’s quick and easy and ﬁlled with fun
graphics. But, complete? Authoritative? The best materi-
al you are likely to ﬁnd on any given topic? No_.

A mission impossible: destroying Clinton

 

“Good morning, Mr. Dole.

‘This is a photo of William J. Clinton, an
Arkansas Democrat who was elected President of the
United States four years ago under false pretenses.

vADespiteourbesteﬂ°ortstodestroyhim,inwhichwe

have been valiantly assisted by a Pittsburgh ﬁnancier
and the nation’s largest newspaper, and despite a nuIn—
ber of the scandals in his administration that even our
enemies in the press have revealed, he still remains
popular.

“Your mission,» should you choose to accept it, is
to defeat Mr. Clinton in the upcoming election.

"Ihis tape will self-destruct in ﬁve seconds. Good
luck, Mr. Dole.”

Talk about a “Mission: Impossible!”

In the nearly 25 years I’ve been looking at politics,
I have never seen as much pure contempt for any pub-
lic ﬁgure as conseryative Republicans display toward
Clinton. They may not want to admit this, but that con-
tempt had a lot to do with his reelection.

So why do the Republicans hate Clinton so
much? Actually, it’s pretty easy.

The GOP despises Clinton largely because he got
elected the same way President Reagan did in 1980 —
with a strong organization, plenty of passion, solid
communication skills, and a mirror-polished image
despite less than ethical behavior. Simply put, he beat
them at their own game. ~

Flash back to 1980, the first “Republican
Revolution” and Reagan, to this day the only man able
to unite party moderates and conservatives.
Unfortunately, the conservatives have since consistent-
ly misread the implications; they still believe they were
largely responsible for Reagan’s rise to power. (If any-
thing, Reagan made them.)

The bloom came off the rose in 1986, when the
GOP lost the U.S. Senate. Two years later, an inept and
“wimpy” George Bush defeated an even more inept
Michael Dukakis, but the GOP still held onto its belief
that its political agenda kept them in the White House.

Along came Clinton in 1992 —— and it was all
over.

Furthermore, by being reelected, Clinton also
damaged Republicans’ self—irnage that people were
indeed buying what they were selling. In fact, right-
wing activists fought Clinton from the get-go precise-
ly because they knew he could win. WRRK’s Jim
Quirm, one of Clinton’s ﬁercest critics, even admitted

 

on the air, “When he gets into his campaign mode,
watch out!”

Furthermore, Clinton managed to expose weak-
nesses in the Republican budget agenda Now, that
was the GOP’s fault for playing politics with the bud-
get in the ﬁrst place, and it didr1’t make things any eas-
ier two years ago when sorne of its people in Congress
told the press what they planned to do. Vice-President
Al Gore subsequently shot down popular support for a
balanced-budget amendment when he called for
Congress to decide beforehand what programs would
be cut Then, we saw the two goveirirnent shutdowns
which all but ensmed Clinton’s reelection.

What’s worse for the GOP, it really doesn’t have
an electable presidential candidate just yet — at least
one its conservatives would accept. At this date,
Democrats Gore and House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt are considered the frontnmners for the 2000

presidential election (That’s one reason for all these

investigations; the GOP will try but fail to link alleged
corruption to the Democrats.)

Adding insult to injury, the rabid conservative
press has had little impact on Clinton’s popularity.
Dick Scaife, the aforementioned Pittsburgh ﬁnancier
who owns the Tribune-Review and the money behind
the arrti-Clinton conspiracy (yes, you heard me right),
keeps reporter Christopher Ruddy in Washington for
the express purpose of getting dirt on him Of course,
they’re angry with CBS’ Mike Wallace for exposing
the Vince Foster murder case as a non-story in an
October 1995 episode of 60 Minutes.

Then there’s The Wall Street Journal, which nms
an anti—Clinton editorial literally every day and boasts
that it has compiled enough material on Whitewater to
publish two books. That we would have never heard of
Whitewater if not for the savings-and-loan scandal,
which resulted from laissez-faire economic policies
the WSJ consistently supports, probably doesn’t occur
to that paper.

Even the Paula Jones case is pure politics —— she

first made her allegations of sexual harassment public
at a news conference attended by Cliff Jackson, a
prominent Arkansas Republican who has been trying
to humiliate Clinton for over 20 years.

Last month, I heard someone on a talk show sug-
gest that Bob Dole actually sabotaged own his presi-
dential bid. Wishful thinking, perhaps, but as my col-
league Mike Berquist said to the GOP, “You lost. Get
over it.”

Rick Nowlin would like to remind everyone that hate
destroys itself

POINT

St. Valentine's Day...

The 405* c'

Valentine’s Day is quickly
approaching, and with all you love-
birds running around buying candy
and flowers, I’d like to remind you
of a few reasons why you should
hate this so-called holiday, which
my roommate and I have affection-
ately renamed: The Darkest Day Of
the Year.

Let’s start with the origins of
this day, since February 14th is,
after all, supposed to be a celebra-
tion of St. Valentine. Famous for
his love poems or utter romanti-
cism? I think not. Martyred in
Rome, this man was drawn and
quartered — literally torn to pieces
— and his bloody, severed head
was paraded around the streets for
onlookers to mock. Charming as
that story may be, St. Valentine’s
festival day has long been removed
from the calendar of saints’ days,
as history has proven that he was
most likely nonexistent, anyway.

Let’s see — a celebration of the
nonexistent. Yep, that sounds about
right.

Now, if love can only be
expressed through heart—shaped
objects, ﬂowers, balloons, and all
that other mush, how can any ratio-
nal, thinking being take this emo-

 

 

 

cry of theyear A day full of

as if the fate of the world somehow
hangs in the balance, and by the
time the prom itself finally rolls
around, you expect nothing short
of perfection. Unfortunately, what
you find is that you and the friends
you see every blessed day of your
life are finishing the conversation
you started in the cafeteria that
afternoon and making plans for the
next day. Decked in sequins, beads,
and high heels (or a tux), you
spend the whole night knowing
that something should be special
about this night, but the situation is
so damn familiar that you just can’t
figure out what you were so excit-
ed about. By four in the morning,
you’re falling asleep on your date’s
shoulder and cursing out everyone
who won’t let you leave for anoth-
er hour.

This is a good prom. Bad
proms involve crying, screaming,
and more crying.

Valentine’s Day is just the
same. You find yourself making
plans, buying new outfits, and get-
ting all worked up for a day that is
just like any other — except you
don’t realize that it’s just like any
other until halfway into the night
when you wonder what’s' missing.
Regardless of how well the day
goes, your expectations leave you

tion seriously? The whole looking for just a little more. You

that, we are just worsening the
problem. February 14th is a place-
bo — a lie which we try as hard as
we can to believe, even though we
know how unbelievable the whole
idea really is.

Valentine’s Day is like a high
school prom. For weeks and
months before the prom, one
searches for the perfect dress, the
perfect ﬂowers, and, of course, the
perfect date. Each decision is made

guessed it: crying, screaming, and
more crying. This one day can
make or break an entire relation-
ship, and it’s all based on some-
thing that never even existed. It
seems a bit ridiculous, but I guess
that’s to be expected on the
Darkest Day of the Year.

Sara Burgess would like to wish
everyone a very happy Valentine’s

1 Day.

St.   Valentine’s Day...

A Shakespeare professor of mine once
gave me a piece of advice that I’ll never forget:
“Form is only important when something devi-
ates from it in a creative way. Otherwise, it’s
boring or stupi ” He was referring to the liter-
ary devices of Comedy and Tragedy, but it ﬁts
a lot of real life situations too. One of them is

A Sure — it is retarded. But it doesn’t have
to be. Valentine’s Day provides two lovers with
an opportunity to go beyond the ho-hum
stereotypes and impress each other by break-
ing them. Go beyond expectations. Break the
lame backdrop the 14th provides and use it to
your advantage. And don’t be stupidly dilTer-
ent A dozen roses dipped in chocolate is not
creative unless Marriott is serving it in the cafe-
teria.

Fellas —— of course she’s expecting ﬂow-
ers, but impress her with something dilferent.
And make sure you IMPRESS her. Getting her
a single daisy in place of a spectacular spray of
six dozen roses is not sweet, and won’t touch
her in any way. You will, on the other hand,
ﬁnd out what a daisy tastes like.

Don’t rely on simply buying something
for her. If she wants something that badly,
she’ll buy it herself. 'lhere’s a reason she likes

YOU. There’s something about your personal--

ity that she can’t ﬁnd in anyone else. Try to ﬁg-
ure out what she’s doing with a schmoe like
you and accentuate it.

The most precious thing two people have
together is time —- money can’t buy it, and
once it’s gone, it is gone forever. There are a lot
of romantic places to go in this city that can
make a very sweet evening. Take a trip down-
town and ride the incline to Mount Washington
Friday night. Take a cruise on one of the river-
boats that scour the Allegheny and
Monongehela.

Go somewhere you’ve never gone before,

supposedtornakethewomanhappy.Butthis
isjustanotherchancetobreaktradition.Take
yourboyﬁiendouttodinner,ort1eathimtoa
night on the town.

Butthisistheperfectopportunitytotest
your lover, too. You don’t want some stupid
materialistic moron for a partner, so if your sig-
niﬁcant other balks at any idea that might cost
less than $200, then maybe you should take out
a personal ad somewhere and ﬁnd a new mate-
rialistic moron.

The point is, I know Valentine’s Day is
lame. Everyone knows it. But if you really love
your boyfriend or girlfriend, you’ll do some-
thing to change his or her mind about that.
Society has given you the form to follow —- it’s
up to you to make it original.

Of course, my opinion only goes so far.
I’m not a tour guide. and I can’t attest to your
personal relationships, so I’m sure you can
come up with ideas that are 10 times better than
mine. My only other suggestion is to be kind if
your lover tiies to be original. Sometimes the
best intentions fail miserably, but at least some
thought was involved. To me, that means more
than some silly piece of jewehy or ﬂowers.

Lastly, there is one other thing you can do
to revitalize Valentine’s Day. I won’t go into it
here. Frankly it’s none of my business.

Just do what comes natural.

If you need me to tell you more,_ then
you’ve got problems.

One little word
can mean so
very much

 

In my world the only cool thing is
sports.
Wrap your overpriced gifts and ﬂuff up
your baby’s breath, because it’s that time of
year again.

Valentine’s Day.

Oh, how splendid. Another frivolous
holiday where logocentric, materialistic
folk who smother themselves with nauseat-
ing, signifrcant others share their love for
each other.

I think that really says a lot about peo-
ple in general. There are 365 days in a cal-
endar year and we pick one, a single, soli-
tary day, to express our undying love for
that special someone.

Teddies, brown and ﬂuffy or white and
lacy, depending on the libido of your mate,
are a popular item this holiday season.

Jewelry is also a common olfering on
Saint Valentine’s Day. Sick-in-love saps
with low self esteem hotstep it and scarf up
any and all glimmering gems possible.

But nothing is worse than the mix tape
from Hell, with all of the tear—jerking, ﬁst
through the wall, picture—tearing, hang-up-
call-instigating love songs we awkwardly
danced to in seventh grade and even today.

You all remember the songs, so don’t
even try to put up that tough guy/gal facade.
Hours upon hours of ridiculous stop, record,
play, repeat; stop, record, play, repeat. You
all know the monotonous terror I speak of.

It began so innocently, so carefree and
illuminating, with thoughts of going to the
Chapel of Love, and then your parents gave
you the Book of love and said, “All You
Need is Love. ” ”

The compilation was a hit and things
progressed. You asked yourself, “Is This
Love? Why Can’t This Be Love? What’s
Love Got to Do VVth It? Don’t You Want
Somebody to Love?”

T H E
Size just
doesn’t
matter

Eric Knopsnyder sits
down with Pittsburgh
Angel Althea Rodgers

TPN: Did you play any sports in high
school?

A lthea Rodgers: I played ﬁeld hockey
and I actually managed the wrestling and
football teams and hung around the
[men’s] rugby team that we had in high
school.

TPN: So how was the transition?

AR: I’d say the biggest transition was that
women’s sports are very different from
men’s sports and rugby has the same rules
for men as for women. It’s acceptable for
women to play rugby because they have
their own women’s teams. You don’t see
that many women’s football teams around
or women’s wrestling teams. If given that
opportunity, I probably would have wres-
tled and probably would have played
football.

T'PN: I know that you love the physical
nature of the sport, but doesn’t it worry
you that you could get injured?

AR: You can get injured in any sport you
play — that’s the risk you take by being
an athlete. It doesn’t matter what sport
you play. You could play ﬁeld hockey.
You could play golf. You could play any-
thing — soccer, wrestling.

Althea Rodgers leaves striped toes in the dust on her quest for another score.

TPN: I have to say the risks are a little
higher in rugby than in golf.

AR: Well, yeah, probably a little higher
than in golf. The risks are still there.
Actually there have been studies that say
that rugby is safer than football, in that the
rules are adjusted to protect you. You
don’t have padding because you’re only
going to hit somebody as hard as you
want to be hit.

TPN: So you have to know your lirnita—
tions?

AR: I wouldn’t say limitations but self-
preservation. You’re not going to go out
there and try to kill yourself. Things hap-
pen — you get injured. Your natural reac-
tions to things are going to be what pro-
tects you from getting hurt. If you’re not
ﬁt and you’re not healthy and you’re not
strong, you’re going to get hurt.

T'PN: So do you do much training in the
off-season?

AR; Lifting, running, to try to keep in
shape. But that first time back  This
weekend at the Penn State clinic -— the
ﬁrst time we were hitting, even doing
some of the plays for the ﬁrst time -
you’re not used to standing bent over. My
back is sore, my butt is sore, my arms are
sore. I have bruises all over and I’m

going, “What am I thinking playing this

sport?”

Thursday, February 13, 1997 

Sir-DowN

TPN: Do people ever react strangely "

when they ﬁnd out that you play rugby?

AR: All the time. All the time. That’s a big e,

conversation piece for people. There are a
couple of reasons for that. The first reason
is because I’m small. I’m 5’2”, 120 lbs.
They look at me and go, “You play
rugby? Ha—ha—ha!” Especially since what
they’re used to hearing about rugby is that
it is this big brutish sport where they beat

each other up. Anywhere I wear my jack— 
et people stop me. People stop me on the ’

street and just start talking to me.

TPN: How do you think the team is going
to do and who do you think the toughest
teams are going to be that you are going to
play?

AR: I think tl_rat our schedule is a lot easi-

er than it was in the fall. We had a lot of

difficulty with our schedule and we had a

lot of new players. A lot of our old players 

weren’t around. So we were playing with,

basically, an all—new team, and we were 
playing some of the toughest teams in the .3

country. We have dropped down the level

as far as what we have scheduled, but we 5:‘

The mighty have fallen.

The 18th-ranked Vrllanova
Wildcats invaded the Field
House Wednesday, intent on
avenging a nationally-televised
blowout loss this past weekend.
They didn’t.

Led by Jason Maile’s 40
points and assisted by the
largest, loudest crowd at home
this season, the Pitt Panthers

stop them,” said Vrllanova Head
Coach Steve Lappas. “We
broke down.”

Maile did most of the
breaking, with three-point
bombs from 'all points beyond
the arc. When he wasn’t shoot-
ing, he was rnaking pinpoint
passes inside to Panther senior
Gerald Jordan, or guarding
‘Nova freshman phenom Tim

Thomas. Thomas scored 23 on

the halftime break, but was
swamped by a 15-6 Vrllanova
run at the beginning of the sec-
ond period Behind Thomas and
guard Alvin Williams (who led
the team with 27 points), the
Wildcats pushed the lead up to
as much as eight.

Jenny McCarthy?

No, Jason Maile.

Maile proved to be a one-man
inferno last night, scorching Villanova
for a career—high 40 points. With his
ESPN highlight performance, Maile led
the Panthers to a thrilling 95-89 victory
over‘ 18th-ranked Villanova.

“I got in the zone,” Maile said after
the game. “I wish there were more
games like this.”

The eight three—pointers poured in
by Maile set a personal record and tied

a Panther record for three-pointers
made in a game. Andre Alridge also had
eight treys versus Georgia in 1994.
Maile rained treys from all over the
court last night. He made nearly every
type of three imaginable: treys from the
comer, from the wing, a NBA—range
shot from the top of the key, and even a
three with both a Villanova defender
and Pitt forward Andre Howard crash-

ing into him.
Maile regularly had Villanova
defenders draped over him, as

Villanova Head Coach Steve Lappas
tried three separate defenders on Pitt’s
sharpshooter. Tim Thomas, Alvin
Williams, and John Celestand tried to

slow Maile down, but he smoked them
all.

Maile was open for most of the
night because of outstanding contribu-
tions from Pitt’s big men. Center Gerald
Jordan and forward Chad Varga set ter-
rific picks for Maile, taking out Maile’s
defender and freeing him for an open
shot at the hoop.

“[Villanova] started bodying me a
lot more,” Maile said. “Our big men set
me up perfectly.”

Maile’s electrifying performance
ignited the sold-out Field House into a
frenzy last night. Pitt will need this
enthusiasm as they weather their tough-
est run of games down the stretch.

Once again, the Panthers recovered
from a three—goal deﬁcit this past weekend to
defeat the Robert Morris Colonials 7-4 at the
Airport Alena.

Turning in a good game for the Panthers
was Bill Elliott, who got the hat trick and ﬁn-
ished with ﬁve points. Jason Darby had four
points, Dan Woodbury and Mike Girvin
each scored two points.

Three minutes into the game, Robert
Morris’ Joe Rittler scored to give the
Colonials a 1-0 lead. .

Five minutes later, Pitt tied the game on
a goal by Ryein Moore.

The rest of the ﬁrst period belonged to
Robert Morris as they dominated play. \V1th
6:06 left in the ﬁrst, John Lynn scored giving
Robert Morris a 2-1 lead.

Four minutes later, Lynn struck again,
giving the Colonials a 3-1 lead at the end of
the ﬁrst.

“A lot of people didn’t take them seri-
ously,” White said “'Ihey came out jurnpin’
and we came out ﬂat”

Robert Monis continued “jumpin”’ in
the second period. "IWenty—two seconds into
the period, John Hanna scored, giving
Robert Morris a 4~l lead.

Down by three goals, Pitt pulled starting
goaltender Kenny and put in Dave Ciarletta

Thursday, February ‘I3, ‘I997

 

After a shaky start, Pitt’s offense came
alive when Girvin scored on what was a pass
that trickled in after being deﬂected by a
Robert Monis defenseman. Girvin’s goal, to
cut the lead to 4—2, was assisted by Travis
Wills and Anthony Muﬂi.

A minute later, Pitt’s Toki Baron scored
on the power play, assisted by Darby and
Elliott making it a 4—3 game.

V Midway through the second, Elliott
scored a sholt—handed goal assisted by
Woodbury and Darby,tying the game at 4—4.

VVlth just 28 seconds left in the second,
Elliott, Darby, and Woodbury proved to be
effective together as they once again com-

bined for a goal to give Pitt the lead for the

ﬁrst time in the game.

After holding off the Colonials oﬂ°en—
sive attack through the second period,
Ciarletta came out and Kenny went back in.

“We pulled Pat in the second period
while he got his head together,” Assistant
Coach Rick Niedt said. “He went back in
and didn’t let up a goal.”

Seven minutes into the third period,
Girvin scored his second of the game, assist-
edbyMuﬂitogivePitta6-4lead

VVlth just two minutes left, Elliott scored
his third goal of the game, assisted by Darby.
This put- the game out of reach for Robert
Morris at 7-4.

“I think this game was a good wake up
call for us,” White said.

Hoops

Wﬂdcat defenders.

It added up to a ﬁve—point play, a two-
point Vlllanova lead, and a very active
crowd. Pitt would take the lead for good two
minutes later, when Maile sank his seventh
trey of the night, this one over Thomas’ hand.

“When he reads the screens correctly,
he’s going to knock it down,” said Pitt Head
Coach Ralph Willard, ‘‘If you give him a
look, it’s going in.”

After Maile’s bomb, Jordan took over
underneath, converting layups off crisp pass-
es ﬁom Maile and Vonteego Cummings. His
last lay—in forced a Wildcat timeout at 4:27.

The crowd’s reaction to Lappas’ timeout
was the loudest of the game. The combina-

 

FROM PAGE 12

tion of crowd, band, and Panther Paul’s sec-
ond set of pushups seemed to shake the entire
building. Even Pitt football Head Coach Walt
Harris, seated quietly by the Field House exit,
was up and clapping.

Malle’s eighth and final three—pointer
came on Pitt’s fnst possession after the stop
page, sending the crowd to their feet again.
Some poor stretch foul shooting by the
Panthers and two late threes from Wﬂliarns
put the ﬁnal margin at six.

“It was just one of those nights,” said
Maile, who said his 40-point performance
was an all—time personal best. “I don’t even
know what to say. I wish there were more
nights like this.”

Thursday, February ‘I3, 1997

Col u m n 
twisted itself into uninviting knots of Inis—
understanding and confusion, even more
questions abounded.

VW1y Must I Be a Teenager in Love?
Why Do Fools Fall in Love? What Is Love?
And Have You Ever Really Loved a
Woman? .

What exactly are these morbid, vomit-
inducing thoughts that disseminate into
your mind stronger than anything else ever
has?

You are becoming a Love F ool, drown-
ing in the Sea of Love, feeling like you’re
riding the Rollercoaster of Love, having
some Summer Lovin’ in the Love Shack;
now that has to be The Greatest Love ofAll,
huh?

Not exactly, you say?

Fine. If you’re a little more risque you
might try Love In An Elevator or Radar
Love. If your demented, criminal mind
shines through, you can try Muskrat Love,
Baby Love, or slipping your unwilling part-
ner love Potion #9. If you move like the
Ocean of Love, maybe you’ll hear Love Me
Two Times.

This is the point of no return; there is no
chance of rescue — you must ride it out and
let the chips fall where they may.

Your Love Is On the Rocks, and you ask
your friends what you can do to ﬁgure out
this Tainted love. Showering that not—so—
special-anymore person with gifts isn’t
working. Lung—busting arguments begin
and the neighbors are starting to talk

'I'l-IE PITT NEWS

 

“You Can ’t Buy Me Love!”
“But Love Will Never Do Without You.”
“Stop, In the Name of Love.”

“No, Be My Lover.”

“No. You Give Love a Bad Name.”

, “But I Can’t Help Falling in Love I/Wth
You. All I Want To Do Is Make Love To You.”

“Oh well, Love Hurts.”

“Please, I Would Do Anything For
Love.”

“Hey, loser. Love bites.” I

“But I'll Make Love to You (Like You
Want Me To)”

“Forget it! It’s over. We ’re Sending Our
Love Down the'Well.”

(Point out that that is but one of the 50
Ways to Leave Your Love[ r] .)

That’s it, where do you turn now?

It Must Have Been Love, but it’s over
now. You have nothing to do but sit around
and Sow the Seeds of Love and sing another
Old-fashioned Love Song to yourself. You
thought it was Endless Love when you
heard him/her say, “I Will Always Love
You ” Hearing that is the Glory of love, but
it always turns out that love is a Battleﬁeld

So as you wake up tomorrow and real-
ize that Valentine’s Day is rearing its bas-
tardly head, just take my advice.

Love Stinks, so If You Can ’tBe With the
One You Love, Beat It.

Alligator proves Spacey can clirec

Veteran wiseguy Greg Roman examines Wiseguy veteran

Albino Alligator

Directed by Kevin Spacey

Starring Matt Dillon, Faye Dunaway,
and Gary Sinise

Kevin Spacey is not yet known for
being a director. Mel Proﬁtt maybe, fucking
Kaiser Verbal Kint, or of course the
Unnamed Bad Guy from Seven who cut
Brad Pitt’s girlf1iend’s head off and put it in
a cardboard box  OK, if nothing rang a bell
yet, then Kevin Spacey won’t either. After
all, without him none of these bastards
would have been so bastardly. I can remem-
ber the day I saw the trailer for Albino
Alligator. I was like, “Damn, that looks pret-
ty good!” Matt Dillon was the only person I
recognized. Then I read, “A ﬁlm by Kevin
Spacey” andl said, “Well gosh be to shit! If
this sonofabitch is making a movie I’ll be
first in line!” So I showed up wearing a box
of popcorn for a cup, with a freshly chilled
forty and a straw in my bookbag, seeing as
food and inebriation add to viewing plea-
sure.... (clothing can also be of concern,
depending on the premise, of course, but
that is another story ...)

. This story, by the way, is not totally
about a pale lizard. Most of it is about three
small time hoods. Dova (Matt Dillon), Milo
(Gary Sinise), and Law (Wﬂliarn Fichtner)
are a crew who get themselves into trouble
fast, through_a case of mistaken identity, and
then end up picking up a tail. It’s a little too
complicated to get into on paper, but in the
car chase the bad guys lose the fuzz forever,

if you know what I mean. I would advise
paying close attention to this scene, which is
filmed quite nicely, in my opinion. The
problem now is that they have no car and
Milo’s badly injured, so the boys have to
find someplace quick to hide. Basically the
story starts here, in a little bar called Dino’s
Last Chance or something like that. Dino’s
is where they meet the rest of the players. A
hostage situation arises, and many twists
and turns fall upon our trusty highwaymen.

Dino’s is the set for most of the rest of
the ﬁlm. This sort of thing usually doesn’t
work well, but in this case it does ﬁne.
Points of interest about this f1lrn are the early
crash scene (which I intentionally did not
explain), and a snippet of dialogue played
out by Law (William Fichtner), who
explains what an Elbow Gator (Albino
Alligator) is. Matt Dillon is in rare form.
Faye Dunaway is still beautiful as Janet.
Gary Sir1ise’s character, Milo, is bearable,
but nothing too great. I’H give props to Joe
Mantegna for his badmouthed motherfuck-
ing of the media in his role as an ATF agent.
The best player of this ﬁlm is surely William
Fitchner, though, who walks a tight rope
between viciousness and mild—mannered,
moral goodness.

Consider excellent actor-tumed—direc—
tor projects like Sean Penn’s Indian Runner
and Robert DeNiro’s Bronx Tale;. I’m not
just talkin’ good actors — I’m talkin’ good
good good actors, who know acting well
enough to know how to handle their actors
when sitting in the director’s chair. Neither

of these ﬁlms are as formed as Kevin
Spacey’s. In all three of the above cases, if
put under“ a microscope, there would proba-
bly be some similarities (in the direction of
acting particularly) but in Spacey’s case
something could be going on. What I mean
is that I was held captive within the space of
Dino’s, along with the bad guys, and lis-
tened deeply to what was being said, as
opposed to simply following the plot. I’m

Matt Dillon and Gary Sinse ponder their late in Alino Alligator.

 

basically saying that I really enjoyed this
ﬁlm. It could be because of everything I just
said or because there were only four pmple
(none of the usual assholes) at the screening,
which happened to be on Fat Tuesday (and,
coincidentally, Albino Alligator was shot in
the big N.O. - New Orleans — and I’m partial
to that city). Check this one out, and tell me
if I’m wrong.

“Tales from the Vienna Woods”
Pitt Theatre
directed by David Pellegrini

L It’s that time of year again, and Pitt Theatre’s
mainstage season is underway this week. Ph.D. can-
didate David Pellegrini is directing this semester’s
first biggie, “Tales from the Vienna Woods” by Odon
von Horvath. “Who is Odon von Horvath?” you may
ask. Good question; it is indeed one I asked as well.
Odon Von Horvath is an Austrian playwright whose
play “Tales  takes place in 1930s Germany and
deals with things like a depressed Germany, mean
old women, and Strauss Waltzes.

' Director Pellegrini, of “Blood on a Cat’s Neck”
and “Enrico IV” fame, usually eschews the realistic
orjnaturalistic element in his productions and has

concentrated on other styles of production, like futur-
ism in “Enrico IV” or modemist/post—modemist
ideas in “Blood on a Cat’s Neck.” Regarding last
summer’s Pe1legrini—directed “King Lear,” I dare
anyone to describe what was truly going on (and I
was in the damn show)! However, in “Tales from the
Vienna Woods,” he has decided to stay rather true to
the text and produce something as close to the writ-
ten word as he can. He doesn’t see this as a depar-
ture from his usual theatrical visions, but rather as a
measure of reverence for the text of the play, which
he sees as something that cannot be distorted.
Everyone who’s anyone is in this show, includ-
ing first year M.F.A. students Tim Johnson and
Derrick Sanders, Mr. Burns impersonator Sue
Galloway, the perennial badboy Jeff Detweiler,

. Marie.Sirakos, Chris Rath,handg Shannon Murin.

“No Exit”

’ . Written by Jean Paul Sartre

Directed by Cheryl Young
Presented by The Acting Co.

Damp walls and dusty curtains make
the abandoned church feel dismal and
haunted. The audience occupies pews that
line the walls of the performance area. The
service that the audience is attending is a
theatrical hell with sexual undertones. The
Acting Company’s performance of Jean
Paul Sartre's “No Exit" occupies this
Church in Lawrenceville, an ironic setting
for a play set in Hell. The atmosphere is
unsettling. but nonetheless befitting for
this surreal play.

Playwright Sartre created this classic,
cringing relationship between three sexu-
ally frustrated chzuacters trapped in a
room in Hell. Ines Serrano (Lisa Brennan)
is a mail—canying lesbian. Estelle Rigault
(Kathleen Donnelly) is a gold—digging
slut. and Joseph Garcin (Gregory
Johnstone) is a burnt—out womani/.er. In
Sartres Hell an increase of sinners has
called for a downsize in staff. So people
we strategically placed to torture each
other with their contradictory personali-
ties. This is an interesting way of looking
at things. considering that it implies that
we can make our own Hell on earth with-
out having to die to get there. There are no
ﬂames. but there is also no air condition-
ing. Corrtipt with oddities. Szutres dis-

New Pittsburgh Symphony
Orchestra director has
some tricks up his sleeve

turbing one act is straight out of the realm
of existentialist thought.

Hotel Hell contains nothing but
rooms and has no mirrors. Unable to seek
serenity in silence, the trio begin to spill
their guts, each explaining what they did
to deserve a couch in Hell. Ines is a ruth-
less man—hater who nags at Joseph to let
her have Estelle for her own vice. But
wait! Estelle wants Joseph zmd Joseph
wants Ines to believe hes not a coward.
Therefore no one gets what they want and
that. folks. is the glory of Hell. (Soap
operas are pretty’ hellish to begin with —
ed.)

The dialogue gets exhausting at times.

due to its emphasis on the stubbornness of

each character and their refusal to abandon
their earthly desires. The scenes grow
stagnant at times because there we no set
changes. At the same time. this element
intensifies the relationship and adds sick

frustration to the story. The University of

Pittsburghis Tim Golebiewski was put in
charge of the set. which proves his worth
in terms of designing Hell. "No Exit" is
the sort of play that has been perforrned a
thousand different times. and this version
holds up. The Acting Contpany has once
again done a great job.

Long live the King! Mariss
Jansons, designated Pittsburgh
Symphony Orchestra Music
Director, revealed last Tuesday at
a press conference at Heinz Hall
his plans for the 1997-98 season.

“Expect the Unexpected” is the
motto for a new concert feature
called “The Musical Mysterpiece."
Jansons wants to keep audiences
guessing by playing selected
pieces unknown to them at concert
time. “This season I want to
expand the audience exposure to
obscure, but equally great, music,"
he said. The Musical Mysterpiece
selections will highlight little
known music written by well-
known composers.

With his surprise selections.
Jansons wants “to link a program
of huge variety” including the
Verdi Requiem, a two-year cycle
of Haydn London Symphonies, the
celebration of 20th-century com-
posers such as Claude Debussy
and Leonard Bernstein, and the
presentation of the American com-

posers Joan Tower and Anthony
Davis.

“This is the most diverse sea-
son that we have seen in Pittsburgh
in a long time,” said Gideon
Teplitz, Managing Director of the
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.
“This speaks to Mariss Jansons‘
dynamic range of repertoire.“

This range makes the ‘97398
season “one of mass appeal,"
according to Jansons. But at the
same time. he pointed out, that to
him, “the spiritual need of the pub-
lic is more important than its
entertainment.” He sees a special
responsibility in presenting mod-
ern music, knowing that “many
don’t like it.”

Jansons. currently Music
Director of the Oslo Philharmonic
Orchestra. Wants to open the sea-
son with Mahler’s Symphony No.
5 and play at least one Mahler
piece a season. The reason: “I am
completely crazy about Mahler.”

The Monorchid
Let Them Eat
Lovitt Records

Here it is. After a couple of
single releases, a compilation
appearance, and three trips to
Pittsburgh, we now have a
Monorchid project stocked
mainly with the set list that has
been running through devoted
minds. Let Them Eat, the long
awaited LP, was released on
Lovitt Records last week.

The Monorchid has proven to
be a hard—working band, able to
handle touring tribulations and
make out for the best. A trip to
Pittsburgh in the fall to play at
the now defunct Beeler St. site
fell apart on them, but this was
only discovered upon their

. arrival. So they played an awe-

some radio show for WRCT
instead. Since then, Monorchid
played two live shows at CMU’s
University Center and blew the
joint apart.

This album deserves to be
played loud. “Bitch Test” and
“Midget Housing” are two of the
most hardcore songs I’ve heard
in recent years. However, The
Monorchid tends to let the songs
come through on their own, rely-

through Monorchid’s overall
raucous onslaught.

Space
Spiders
Universal Records

There’s so much crap filtering
out of the UK today, that it is hard
to keep it from overﬂowing into the
US record bins. Everything that
screams Brit-pop is being marked
heavily, and it all seems to be a
return to Beatlemania.

Yes, we thought it ended in the
‘60s  or at least the early ‘70s,
but bands like Oasis and Khula
Shaker seem intent on dragging us
back in time. Fortunately, there are
some decent bands coming out of
Britain with an ounce of originality.

This is where Space comes in,
with a bit of a different approach.
While there have been many tech-
no-dance bands to come from over-
seas, Space attempts to take the
techno feel a bit further.

With inﬂuences that include
such diverse sources as Frank
Sinatra and Cypress Hill, it is easy
to see that Space doesn’t want to fit

Sounda

into the mold of other bands’ Brit-
pop un—originality.

“We’re bored with that,” says
Tommy Scott, the lead singer and
bassist for the band. “That was
done in the ‘60s. That’s just follow-
ing fashion instead of using your
imagination.”

Indeed.

Still, Space’s style does have
the traditional Brit-pop feel, but it
is masked by —— of all things —— ska
and Caribbean beats. And yes,
Frank’s inﬂuence does make its
way into several of the tracks,
including “Female of the Species”
and “Dark Clouds.”

Those tracks also happen to be
the worst on the album. Even
though I happen to think Sinatra is
great, the dancey, Latin feel that
goes along with them make them
sound like the soundtrack to “The
Love Boat.” Frankly (no pun
intended), it makes me shudder.

Space is best when it sets itself
in a ska—ish mood (“Ska—ish,” it’s
the new buzzword of the ‘90sl).
The opening track alone,
“Neighborhood,” makes this album
worthwhile. Although all those
wonky Brits went ga-ga over
“Female of the Species” (it was a
top—4O hit in England), this is truly
the kicker of the album.

 

Thursday, February 13, I997

 

As Caribbean beats and ska
rhythms splash over a funky dance
track, Tommy sings about a nifty
little world populated by the dregs
of society. Killers, thiefs, drag
queens —— it’s like pulling some-
thing straight out of Joseph
Conrad’s The Secret Agent. (See, I
was paying attention in my lit
class!)

The story of Space’s songs are
almost as important as the groovy
music, according to the band.

“I try to write every song as a
film, with a plot and a story,” says
Tommy. «

Other great tracks, like Cypress
Hi1l—influenced “Mister Psycho”
and “Me & You Vs. The World” (a
song that you could swear was
played by the La’s), continue this
p1ot—fil1ed trend.

Overall, Space may try a bit too
hard to be different. When they hit,
however, they do it well. Some
songs can be skipped over, but it is
a solid debut effort.

Now, if we could only get more
good music from the Brits, all
would be good. When Blur loses to
Oasis in the battle of the Brit-pop
bands, you know something is rot-
ten in the state of England.
