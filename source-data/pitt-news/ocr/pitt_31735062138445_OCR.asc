Pittites are assured the livest and
snappiest week of activities that has

borated on specially. Notices of the
various affairs have also been sent to
the individual alumni, with order

blanks enclosed fdr the affairs for _
' which tickets are necessary. '

The Banquet.

The crowning feature of the week,
from an alumni s.tandpoint, will be
the banquet at the Schenley. It is
expected that 500 grads or full capa-
city for the Schenley banquet hall,
will attend. -Col. “Joe"- Thompson is
the toastmaster and the list of speak-
ers is a notable one, including Dr. J.
T. Holdsworth, Louis Broido, «Chancel-
lor McCormick and one other to be
announced. From the minute the
crowd enters the banquet hall there
will be a continual round of "pep.”
“Jim” Scott and Max Loevener will
be on hand to lead the cheers and
Will Davis will direct the singing.
Gus Sohnabel’s -orchestra and “Dick”
Donnelly’s jazz trio will furnish the
music and specialties will be provided
by Yardum, Duve and others. Sou-
venir menu cards, songsters, and fans
are being provided.

A , Seniors Out.

A large representation of the Sen-
iors is looked for, special notices hav-
ing been sent to them. The banquet
rate for all is $4.00, but Seniors get
in addition a free membership in the

Association and The Weekly, for one
year, so that the cost, to them is
really $2.00. The banquet is informal

E and is open to all Pittites—alumni.

students, faculty, etc.

The laying of the Alumni Hall cor-
ner stone is another big feature of
Commencement Day, the exercises
taking place at 2:30. IS-pecial notice

Hall and the public is cordially in-
vité”d to be there. Prof. C. R. Foster
will be the orator of the occasion and

of the stone. The much-talked-of
baseball game between the Varsity
and Fresh is to be played at 3:30 at
Trees Field.

_, Athletic Day. -

furnish sport for lovers of those ac-
tivities all day Saturday, the 5th, and
in the evening comes the “Varsity
Letter Clu ” smoker in the gym.

have special affairs Tuesday, June 8,
the Engineers having the venerable
Dr. Daniel Carhart. as their honor

The fourth annual dinner of the
New York Pitt Club held at
Browne's ‘Chop House, 1424 Broad-
way, Saturday evening, May 22, was
one of those typical New York Pitt
affairs, with -a good attendance and
an abundance of enthusiasm in evi-
dence on all sides. «Chancellor Mc-
Cormick and Benjamin Thaw of the
Board of Trustees were the Pitts-
burgners -there. The speakers were
Commander William Seaman Balu-
bridge, Elwood Hendrick. ‘president
of the Chemist's Club, W. C. Coffin,
William Johnston and Chancellor
McCormick, President Abram Gross
presided as toastmaster and illumin-
ated.‘ his duties with numerous well
suited stories.

Commander. Bainbridge who was
one of the guests at the third an-
nual dinner spoke entertainingly of
the amusing incidents in the life
of a present-day naval _omicer
ashore, he being mistaken almost
daily for the butler, elevator st-art-
er, etc. In tips he has accumu-
lated 35 cents.

Elwood Hendrick quoted from
some of his well known and popular
essays on chemistry an-d made a
plea for a. new occupation for men,
that of “kitchen chemist.”
orated upon ts being essentially a
man's work and‘ of the stimulating
interest to be found in seeking new
and better herbs for sundry pur-
poses.

 

Coffin Speaks.

W. C. Coffin who recently moved
to New York from Pittsburgh, told
of the work done by the alumni in
arranging for “Alumni Hall.” Wil
liam Johnston in a few remarks re-
feared to an effort being made to
bring about a. housing arrangement
for all the Pennsylvania college
men in New York—a “Johnston
idea." This suggestion was then
taken up by the Chancellor, who
then dwelt upon a feature being
worked out by the State Constitu-
tional Convention. By i-t the whole
educational system of the state
would be standardized and uniﬁed

One of the greatest treats ever
presented to Engineering Alumni is
that offered at the alumni luncheon
'1'ue':'day, June 8, when “Uncle Dan"
Carhai-t, the founder of the school,
will be present to conduct a class
in Calculus with some of the oldest
Alumni as students. It sure will be
of interest to the younger Alumni to
watch Dr. Carhart quiz Professors
Stewart, Smith and Lamlbie on some
essentials of Caluclus that they
claim are so easy. It is under-
stood that, all flunks will be as-
ésessed from $5 to .$5,000 for the
beneﬁt of Alumni Hall. All who
are absent without an excuse will
have their assessment dou-bled.

It is proposed if “Uncle Dan” can-
not secure the proper type of‘recita-
tion from the old grads. some of the
gecent ones will be asked to demon-
strate how simple these things real-
ly are to the present students. The
class will assemble promptly a
12:30 and: continue in session unti
1:45. Recitation and -laboratory
work will take place in the For

No “white cuffs."

Tuition, including all fee and lab
oratory materials will be $1.50, pay
able in advance to the registrar
who will establish his office at the
-entrance to the assembly room. The
new rule in regard to additional
fee for re-examination will hot be
in effect for this class. All neces-
sary material, including paper, will
be furnished so that it will be un-
necessary for prospective students
to bring -their text books, note books,
or “white cuffs.”

Following the luncheon, the facul-
ty of the School of Engineering will
be at the home in Th-aw Hall where
opportunity! will be given to exam-
ine some of the latest apparatus, in-
cluding the new wireless station and
the loud speaking wireless tele-
phone. Professor Stewart will dem-
onstrate how little it ought to cost
to run an automobile. Some special
work will be conducted in connec-

In the past the Committee in charge of the Commencement Ban-

worried In order to take care of them.

It will facilitate the work of the committee greatly if you'll

BOXING AND “BATTLE ROYAL?’

Alumni who have won their letter, 1!

in Pitt athletics will gather with the.
undergraduate lettermen,
coaches and managers at the smoker
in Trees gym Saturday night in what
promises to be the peppiest gathering

be the climax to Athletic Day of the
Commencement Program.

The program will be peppy, very in-‘ 

formal and not long. The man who
tries to make a set speech will be
pounced on by a squad of football
huskies, and soundly trounced. In-
stead of speeches, there will be 3
“battle royal,” boxing bouts, stunts,
and a feed, with smokes on the side."
All the varsity coaches will be there, .
including “Pop” Warner, who comes

from Springville, N. Y., for it. “Pop'.'.'-fin

wants to meet all the old timers and
new timers. So does Coach Dick Har-

ley of the baseball team, Andy Kerr ‘A
of the track team, Doc Flint of the 1 ‘

basketball team," John Taylor of the
swimming team and Dr.,Tom Steph-
ens of the tennis team. They will
be introduced to the crowd.

A Battle Royal.

The “battle royal” is in charge of
Steele Gow and “Red” Delphey, ably
assisted by the Prof. “Banann-as”
Diamond, who has the reputation of
furnishing “battle Royalers” who bat-
tle. If they don’t, they don't get their
money, so they will fight. “Dutc_h’-'
Hendrain and Anderson, the Fresh-
man football huskies, are lined up for
one bout and the other will see “Biff”
Bremen pitted against a man of his
weight. Hendrain and Anderson put
up a daisy battle in the University
matches. They won't sta.ll-——~that’_s a
cinch. Hunter Johnston will have.
charge of the eats. , *

Notices have been sent to all the
letter men. If you are a letter man
and didn't get one, don't feel offended.

j 0 brain is all in a whirl trying to learn «
all the different things ‘we are sup-
posed to know, such as why a pig's tail
curls -and why the sea is full of water
and countless other miscellaneous,
pieces of useless information. It it is
true that every psychosis requires a
neurosis and that the square on the
hypotenuse is equal to the sum of two
right angles then how much. does x
equal or how many days will it take A
to build a chickencoop it he works
twice as fast as B? Them’s the kind
of things we has to learn. Ours is a 7
hard life. V We'll certainly be glad

Is 11' WORTH THE cosr?

V. Both to those who wi1VlV'leave_Pitt within the next week and 
 undergraduates who still have one or more years to spend in V’
the ‘University, the question must sometimes occur, “Is it all Vlwortli.

__Is a_ university education of spﬁicient value to warrant the cost V
in the pains and sacriﬁce of study and in the work which is necessary
‘for many to obtain funds for’ their education‘! Is the time spent in a

,gVher...institution of learning wasted? Might it be-better employed.

 in seeming a foothold in some business; in making a. start in’ the

V‘V_’ch_osen career of the individual? These are the questions which face

‘the senior as he looks back over his four years at Pitt; the questions

 ,w_llich, the hustling sophomore must answer as he turns to the work
”'7'_.cf theV,summer-pin an effort to raise money to continue the ﬁght; the

questions which meet the high school boy as hetries to decide

whetl1er.i;o‘enter college or to go to work -at once. This question .-

stands out in stronger outlines than ever before as a ‘result of the

knowledge that all colleges, Pitt included, ‘will raise their tuition.

“VV,V‘To that man or boy who intends to ‘make “Money” his only
goal in the "race of life, who looks for nothing more and hopes for
nothing more, we.-would unhesitatingly. answer, “No.” For he who
does ‘no other aim in life than mere mercenary gain the years in col-

 ‘are truly wasted. 0 - .

 ‘V V_;But.for he who sees the real meaning of education in its finest

 senses... for he ‘whVo’1mows' that the best. things of the world are

‘ achievement and the success which comes not 9. only as ‘a beneﬁt to
V the individual but as. a- blessing to the race, the answer is also very

V/Vlevidgnt. Mere-booktknowledge will fade away as time passes but

,; it is the broader principles of humanity, inculcated in the student
duringilhis college.» days, that will last forever. Let"-he who calculates
the values of thingsin dollars and cents forgetthe idea of further
‘ education for its beneﬁts will be lost upon him. Let he who realizes
he value of culture for the sakeof future generations press onward.

 , Those who feel that the hardships suﬁered through four years in

C tions in the Far East and -the Lev-

any of the above situations should
obtain an application blank in Room

. 1, State Hall. ‘

Dr. A. , A. Snowden, a represen-ta-g

positionslpa-yin-g from $3.50 to $6.00

The bureau expects that it will re-
ceive many physical education posi-
tions after school closes. Girls 'in-
terested should call at the employ-
ment office. It will be open the en-
tire summer.

a, zeifort to win out have amounted to more than the returns there-
from must remember that the growth of that determination and
Ouragcpgreqlﬁred for ultimate victory is alone worth the value of
be whole college course. They must also realize that in this age of
ispecialivzation, the value 0 of special training along certain lines V is
ptimmeasurable.  ‘ L V V V °

 In the current social disorder of the last few years, things have
l:ui5ned\;topsy—turvy and the lot-of the so-called white-collar worker
has seemed a contemptible one. Students contemplate with blue
dismay the prospects of being granted $12 a week positions after
0 3 aduation when-men with no education can earn $20 or $30 a week
3 Nmanual labor jobs. The student_ who declared that he wished that
 etcouldbe satisﬁed in the lot of the average ditch-digger with no

  and no spurring ambition but who, also assured his listeners
, tvhecould never be contented in such a rut-bound andmechanical
 the cast of life, perhaps expressed thesentiment of the whole
 College’*’men, would you trade places, not temporarily, but
non LIFE, with that man in the ditch? Would you be satisﬁed with
_ I3inte1lVig.enVcVc, his pleasures, his entire standard of living, his meas-
,‘~'tl1'e, of hope‘! Would you willingly ‘slip down a notch on the social
scale? Conditions must» again readjust themselves to the point where
worth and effort will be recognized at their true valuations; Not that
the c_Vo11ege man should regard himself as superior to the rest of man-
 but, purely as a business proposition,’ his training for years

, ould give him a better chance to snatch opportunity as it comes

bug and to appreciate the advantages which life shall -oifer him.

Q, ‘ If there is a necessity for special training’; if ambition and a de-
 to rise are praiseworthy; if it is worth while to be able to enjoy
V?¥tVVqV.-the utmost the cultivated pleasures of life ;- if the victories of the
iiture shall be placed above the satisfaction of the immediate pres-,
out»; if men shall continue to be trained as leaders of the community,
VAVV.-of the state, of the nation; indeed, if our whole civilization is to be
V escrved; then a college education is worth while and must continue
be so. ‘ V -: V
College men and women, your training as the chosen instruments
‘pen whom society depends for the future must continue. Hold the
e of battle, come what way, for the better times to come.

OLYMPIC

“The return of the real story of love
to the screen” is the way in which pic-
ture reviewers have been describing
Doris Keane's wonderful success in
“Romance.” which is the feature at-
traction at the Olympic Theater this
week. Miss Keane is a young star in
every sense of the word and today is
recognized as one of America's great-
est emotional actresses. This person-
ality was forcefully given to the lov-
ers of the stage when she portrayed
the role of Sonia Kritchnofe, in “Ar-
sene Lupin,” and in that character it
was so in evidence that it swayed her
audience long before she spoke a sin-
gle wond.

Miss Keane, equipped as she is
with this wonderful magnetism, has
won multitudes of admirers. As an
extra added attraction the Olympic
will offer Johnny Ray in the first of
a series of two,-reel comedies. The
ﬁrst is “Jiggs in Society.” The Pathe
News and Prizma are also on the pro
gram. The Olympic «Symphony Orches-
tra is oﬁering a special musical pro-
gram.

EAST LIBERTY CAMERAPHONE

A story by a Pittsburgh author is
always of interest to Pittsburghers
and when that author is Mary Roberts
Rinehart and the story is “Dangerous
Days,” which is being‘ shown all Week
at the East Liberty Cameraphone, the
interest will reach the highest point.
Made under the personal supervision
of the author and directed by Reginald
Barker, presented by an all-star cast,
including Lawson Butt as Clayton
Spencer and Clarissa Selwynne as his
wife; Barbara Castleton as Audrey
Valentine, Ann Forrest as Anne Klein,
Paline Starke as Delight I-Iaverford
and Bertram Grassby as Rodney Page,
it is a picture that will entertain in

the highest degree. It is a gripping
story of a great marriage problem. Is 1
it always the husband's fault? Has a.
man no right to seek sympathy and
companionship when they are missing
in his own home? It is a story to
make one think; it aims at something
big. The story moves clearly, swiftly
and logically; the subtites are excep-

tionally, brief and -strong--“wall-ops"

—every one of them. A Larry Semon
comedy is shown in connection with
this—“School Days.”

RINGLING BROTHERS-
BARNUM & BAILEY CIRCUS

 

That the human spirit is reincar-
nated both in persons and in all ani-
mals, even after hundreds of years,
is the belief of Miss May 'Wirth, the

dark-haired, dark-ey-ed little Austra-I

lian bareback rider who thrills kid-
dies and grown-ups alike daily at
the far famed Ringling Brothers-

Barnum & Bailey circus, which A

comes to Pittsburgh next Thursday,
Friday and Saturday.

And Miss Wirth knows whereof
-she speaks, when she_ is talking of
reincarnation, she will tell you.
For she has information direct from
her big white horse, Snowball.

ysnowbal-l is fastidious as to his
toilet, even to the point of making
a nuisance of himself, Miss Wirth
says. Two-hour long baths given
with warm water and soap are what
he desires more than anything else.
and if he were to have his way, one
would be his portion daily, al-
though two hours are consumed in
the taking. He is never satisﬁed un-
less he is spotless, and. he manages
to alwayshave a beautiful Marcelle
wave‘ in his long, whi-le tail, which
he will tell you is perfectly natural
and not acquired by any braiding
process.

The epoch-making c-onsolidation of
the Ringling Brothers and Barnum
& Bailey shows has been the
means of bringing together more
and better features than have ever
before been presented in the his-
tory of the circus. “Bigness” is the
keynote of the gigantic combination.
Thursday next the tents will be
erected at Exposition park, Alle-
gheny. On Friday and Saturday ex-

Gathered from the distant waterfalls or gen-
erated by the steam turbine, electric power is
transmitted to the busiest city or smallest
country place.

Through the co-ordination of inventive genius
with engineering and manufacturing resources,

developed to a high state of perfection these
and numerous other applications.

And so electricity, scarcely older than ‘the grad-
uate of today, appears in‘\ a practical: We“
developed service on every hhnd.

Recognize its power, study its applications to
your life's work, and utilize it't_o the utmost

The coaching of coaches will be a
‘course oﬁered at the University by
the School of Education next year. Un-
der the auspices of this school, courses
are being offered for the high school
athletic coach, special emphasis being
placed upon track and football coach-
ing under the direction of Prof. An-
drew Kerr, who is coach of the Pitt
' sity track team and the Freshman
football squad. Courses in athletic
coaching are already well established
at the University, having been inau-
gurated several years ago with former
football stars at the University as
teachers in the various branches of
athletics.
