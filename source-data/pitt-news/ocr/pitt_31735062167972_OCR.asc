‘To Make Judgement L

by BILL GORMLEY
Feature Editor

The Commonwealth’s financial cri-
sis and the University's immediate
monetary woes are apparently near an
end. The General Assembly yesterday
approved a tax package which will pro-
vide sufficient funds for the 1969-70
fiscal year.

Especially important, the State
House an appropriations measure pro-
viding funds for Pitt and other state-
related universities and it appeared
likely" that the State Senate would.fol-
low suit, doing the same early next
week.

The tax package approved by both
legislative chambers included the ex-
tension of the state’s six per cent sales
tax to insurance premiums, a 30 mill

tax on utility property, and a 25 mill ~
increase in the gross receipts tax on ,

utilities.

The measure was placed on the
Governor’s desk yesterday evening

The

and is expected to be signed by Gov-
ernor Shafer within ten days. Then. af-
ter 13 months of disagreement, the
State's financial crisis will formally
end.

Throughout Thursday, the final out-
come of the General Assembly's delib-
erations remained uncertain. The tax
on insurance premiums. which arous-
ed considerable opposition and ‘pro-
voked the wrath of powerful lobbyist.
was approved in the Senate by the bare
margin of three votes. It secured
enough votes for passage in the House
only after suspense had mounted to a
peak. '

Actually, the entire afternoon prov-
ed exciting as_many state legislators
put their careers on the line to resolve
the financial , impasse , which has
plagued the state for solong. The House
began by appropriating money pre-
viously promised. to‘ Pitt and other
state-related universities. Among those
supporting the bill was Representative

John Laudaoio of the 56_tii District,
whose prior opposition to the measure
was expressed in Monday's Pitt News,
but who changed his mind and con-
cluded that continuing state support
of. Pitt is essential.

Shortly afterwards, the Senate took
a giant step, passing the three bill tax
package which was. later approved by
the House, - ’

Elated over yesterday's settlement,.
University sources expressed admira-

tion for those legislators who support— .

ed Pitt's appropriation and the tax
package.

“When the chips were down," Com- ,

monwealth Representative Russ Ar-
nold noted. “the’legislators didn’t let

‘the state-related universities godown

the drain." Emphasizing‘ that “some

of these fellows know that they voted

themselves out of office today," he
said. The final outcome was a tribute
to their concern.

(Editor's Note: The following is a statement issued by John Cav-
aIuc_hy, campaign manager for President-elect Steve Cundra.)

President-elect of Student Government Steve Cundra lobbied in

Harrisburg on Tuesday and Wednesday for the passage of Pitt appro-

priations. Late Wednesday afternoon. he returned to Pittsbrugh to
be installed as the official presidentof Student Government. Before
he could begingto get down to work back at Pitt. he was called into
Assistant Chancellor Kobosky's office. He was told that charges
were leveled against him and that the election was again to be held
in abeyance. These charges centered around the over expenditure of
money by the United Student Coalition Party. These were the same
expenditures that were questioned after the first election. The SG
Election Committee at that time ruled that the expenditures made
by the Committee for Effective Student Government were complete-
ly legitimate. Since all the new expenditures that have been brought
up. have been the result of the efforts of the Committee for Effec-
tive Stu,dent,Government. the United Student Coalition and Steve Cun-
dra have nothing to hide if there is to be another investigation. After
all the party expenditures have been made a matter of public record.

“The inauguration of Student

Cundra was canceled just hours
before schedule Wednesday night
due to the disclosure of informa-
tion -by. his‘ former party treas-
urer, Susan‘ M. Davis, alleging
over-spending and mis-manage-
ment of campaign funds. The in-
auguration cancellation came too
late to ‘postpone the dinner ar-
ranged to celebrate Cundra’s vic-

fairs had to assume finan'cial're- A

of the nature Miss Davis’ allega-

illegally spent on his campaign,

through the use of a personal bank-

told guests who attended the non-

not know enough about the infor-

a full statement.

contributions totaling $l.000from
an outside source which were de-
posited in her account. She claims
that $500 of this amount was an
outright gift from a corporate exe-
cutive and that the other $500 was
in the form of a promissaynote
made out to Cundra.

Susan Davisstated that the pre-

Pitt Expands Language Dept.

Following the growing trend
in colleges across the nation,
the University of Pittsburgh is

v offering a larger and more var-

ied selection of courses in for-
eign languages and literatures
to undergraduates beginning
Fall term 1970. These courses,
‘tailored to suit the objectives of
different types of students, will

be of two types: a comprehen-
sive course that develops read-
ing, writing, speaking, and un-
derstanding, and another that
stresses reading only. In some
cases there will be separate
tracks for materials in humani-
ties, social sciences, and natur-
al sciences.

the University’s financial strain

until the State Legislature pass-
es an appropriation bill.

The student, Charles E. Lew-
is, has paid the University $415.-
00, an amount equal to his es-
timated tuition for the spring
term.

The official in charge of stu-
dent accounts Mr. James N. Bea-
ver, told Mr. Lewis that thelUni-
versity has and T will accept
prepayments from students for
their academic and non-academic

, charges. Such payments need not

be the exact amount of what the
charges may be. Receipts are is-
sued for the amounts‘ paid, which
the student may apply to pay-
ment of the student invoice.

_ Students whose tuition is paid
by a scholarship or other fund.
as in the case for Mr. Lewis. may
also pay in advance. and this
money will be returned to the
individual when the payment is
received from the scholarship
fund.

Mr. Lewis hopes that enough
students will advance money to
the University in this manner so
that the squeeze on the Uni-
versity‘s borrowing power will
be alleviated.

Coed Housing g

Slated For Fall -N

By SHERRI ZIPPAY
Staff Writer

Coeducational housing, an innovative and controversial con-
cept on many campuses. is scheduled to go into effect in Septem-
ber at the University.‘ It will utilize McCormick Hall in the Schenley
Quadrangle. housing 165 students in a suite arrangement resemb-
ling apartment living.

Each suite includes from three to ten students and has bed-
rooms, bathrooms, and kitchens surrounding two living rooms per
floor. Of the four suites on each floor, two will be for men and two
will be for women.

One goal of the new project is that of contributing to the im-
provement of interpersonal relationships among the students par-
ticipating. Hopefully. according to Will Miller. program coordinat-
or.‘co-ed housing will "enable the student to learn to appreciate
members of the opposite sex as human beings rather than merely as
sexual objects." Miller also cited the wider cross section of people
sharing common interests as an advantage to the program. ’

Coed housing emphasizes .the need for a more relaxed and nat-
ural environment for the student, since most students come from
homes, where living is made coeducational by parents or siblings.
John Vrana, Director of University Housing‘, states that the pro-
gram is “a further refinement of our basic housing policy, which is
to provide a variety of living experiences for the student to choose
one to best fit his needs.” Vrana also commended the student com-
mittee for working on the planning and researching the proposal.
The committee was chaired by Doug Browning and Sue Mumma.

I The arrangementnin McCormick will be the pilot project for the
suite living planned for the Hillside Residential Complex, scheduled
to open in September 1972. .

Application and selection procedures for the coeducational pro-
gram in McCormick will differ from those used in other resi-
dences. This will involve applications by individuals or groups on a

voluntary basis. Selection will be done randomly by the Housing“.

Staff in conjunction with the Coeducational Residence Hall Com-
mittee. The $100 non-refundable room deposit must be made to the
Housing Office before application can be considered. Sophomores,
_]ul'IlOI'S. and seniors are eligible to apply. Freshmen and relocating
students must complete a year at the University before applying.

Applications are due in the housing office by March 4. Students
selected will be notified by March 9, which is before room draw-
ings in other residence halls. '

The coed program will be facilitated_by the no—curfew system

for upper class women and new social rules involving open house

visitation hours.

Rabbi Rubenstein. who is dir-

"Our most agonizing prob-

“We need no longer worry about

We pay a heavy price for this

Rubenstein doubts our ability

to create a new system of val- _

Lies adequate to cope with the
stresses and opportunities of our
times: "There are too many peo-
ple with too many radically dif-
ferent backgrounds. personali-

Feb. 26th.

If it were an ordinary sportster, we’d have intro-

Instead, we took the time to build a whole new-

We started with a sleek new shape and a low road-

And added more hood. A faster fastback. Wider
doors. And new deeply contoured bucket seats.

The instrument panel wraps around you.’ With
enough dials to make you think y_ou’re piloting a 747.

There are four transmissions. And six power plants

V Pitt has a financial crisis.‘ Many of ,
ps did not,know__abo_ut it sooner b__'e-
’ "cause" University officials ﬂexpected
’ -that_ the State _Legisl,ature,{would ap-
‘ prop_ria_te*some money and there would

 have been ‘no crisis.

I’ ...This is a reasonable expectation.

 But state expenses, went up more

revenues anddthe Legislature did not

' haveoenough money without passing‘-
. new taxes. However, the taxpayers and -
 voters do not like -new taxes. So.

‘Legislature did not vote any money

political reasons; a system that
tries‘ to eliminate groups such

as the Black Panthers merely to

elongate it’s own repressive rule.

IF YOU are asking yourself
how these things related to the
financial crisis, you are_either

.being naive of dishonest. The

naivete can be cured. but the
dishonesty is something you will
have to live with all of your
life.

The relationship is this: the
reason that _the financial crisis
came about in the first place is
that this is an election year.
and passage of the needed bud-
getary programs would have en-
dangered the political careers of

.many‘of our politician legisla-

tors. The system therefore pro-
vides the means for our repre-
sentatives to consider them-
selves before they consider what
is good for the people.

The problem is not the man

,,who fills. the office. since we
_have seen many good men des-

troyed by. the political games

that they have been forced .to

play. The problem is the sys-

NOW IS NOT the time for
us to relax and congradulate
ourselves on our victory. but it
is the time to continue cooper-
ating and seek to eliminate the
other ills which our society
has been burdened with. Fora

while. many of us forgot about

the revolution and the wayswe
have oftentimes used. outside of
the system. to work against it.

shown us that we can work. to a

Donatelli
Writes An

Inept Analogy

Editor. The Pitt News:

While in basic agreement with
Frank Donatelli’s article. "A New
McCarthyism?" (The Pitt News,
Feb. 9). regarding those who em-
ploy a double standard (on the
Right or Left, I might add). his
implicit accusation of the contem-
porary probers of Supreme Court

 nominee Carswell's past as akin

to (Joe) McCarthyites is a poor
and rather inept analogy.

There is a vast difference be-
tween sifting through the past of
a man who is likely to cast a de-
ciding vote on such macro-issues
as civil rights. law and order, etc.,
and the rampant delving into the
personal histories of federal em-
ployees. liberal intellectuals, and
critics of American policy when
the mere suspicion of pro-com-
munism was often diastrous (e'.g.
Owen Lattimore).

The analogy is exceptionally in-
adequate if one keeps in mind. the
issues involved in the case of Cars-
well, who made a blatantly racist

7'/"_‘;sp~eech 21 years ago, allegedly

=’ Goerge G. Balderose

acted as a segregationist in the
striving to maintain the exclusive-

iness of his country club eight

years later, and, more recently.
has been charged with the "un-
equal“ treatment of civil rights
lawyers. Such factors, especially
now», should weigh heavy in the
confirmation of a Supreme Court

appointee. . ‘ .

Obviously, a distinction must be
made separating the present in-
quiry into Carswell’s past from

the spruious and often irresponsi- _

blebehavior ‘of Joe McCarthy-

 i’Hl'illel Project

 

Kitchen Seeks Members

by STEVE LUBETSKY
Staff Writer

The Hiller Kitchen, in operation
for only a few short weeks, is hav-
ing its share of troubles. Estab-
lished last month to accommodate
Jewish students who wish to keep
Kosher, the Kitchen seeks to in-
crease its subscribers by height-
ening its publicity.

Furthermore, Kosher students
who live in the dorms, must pay
an additional 26 per cent for
maintaining the Kitchen. They
also must pay for the regular meal
ticket, included in the tuition rates
paid by dorm residents, even
though they don’t eat in the cafe-
teria.

By strengthening its publicity,
the Hillel Foundation hopes to
combat this 26 per cent sur-
charge. Efforts are being made
to buy advertising from WPGH
and the Pitt News. Representa-
tives will seek recruits during the
upcoming orientation sessions and
letters will be mailed to all incom-
ing freshmen, whether Jewish or
not.

With more subscribers, the or-
ganization believes that it would
have the solidarity necessary to
eliminate the extra finances its
members must pay. Another al-
ternative being considered is rent-
ing an apartment for Kosher-
keeping students. ‘

Arrangements are being made
with Dean of Students Bernard J.
Kobosky to relieve Jewish stu-
dents who keep Kosher from sign-
ing resident hall contracts. The
Hillel Foundation advises such
students to register with it first
before signing any agreement.

Although there are only four
Kitchen members at present. the
experiment thus far has been a
success. For the project to be
even more successful. however.
more members are needed. Stu-
dents who wish to participate are
urged to contact the Hillel Foun-
dation by calling 621-8875. or sim-

ply by dropping into the Kitchen.-

which is located on the third floor
of the YM and WHA, whenever
they’re hungry.

VISTA will train more than 5,-

other poverty pockets, and in
other types of self-help, antipov-
erty programs.

Over 80 per cent of all VISTA
Volunteers have attended college.
While VISTA is emphasizing the
need for lawyers. architects and
business grads. the majority of
volunteers are still liberal arts
majors.

There are no entrance require-

ments or examinations. Selection

. is made on the basis of the quality
of the application and upon the
feedback given by the references
whom the applicant has listed.
Roughly one out of six applicants
actually enters VISTA training.

Behold Photo Call

by ARTHUR ROSENBERG
Drama Critic

Photo-calls are on most occasions
hectic events. The rehearsal stops—
the actors mull around waiting to be
called, and secretly hoping their pro-
files catch the eye of the photograph-
er. The director eagerly awaits the
last snap of the camera so that rehear-
sal may begin again, and those that do
not get called earnestly hope the photo-
grapher falls off his ladder and breaks
the camera. Some made it and some
didn’t—-thanks to Dr. Curtis Canfield’s

kind cooperation and those of the photo-
genic in the group——beho1d! A few pic-

tures of photo—cal1 . . .

State Upset Will Give  

Adams °Ce1'tain Claim’

By MIKE MILLER

The wrestlers are out to stake their claim to the number
one spot in the E.I.W.A. when they go against Penn State

tomorrow at University Park.

Penn State is ranked as first in the East after their defeat of
Navy. previously rated as the top team in the East.

Coach Dave Adams feels that his team will have a

claim" to the number one spot
if victorious.

“We couldn’t use freshmen be-
fore and now if we win with
freshmen we would feel that we
are number one.”

The freshmen are not consid-
ered eligable to wrestle in var-
sity competition in the E. I.W.A.
matches, but an agreement be-
tween Pitt and Penn State and
Temple permits them to compete
in the varsity matches.

In the two years that Adams
has coached at Pitt, he has tied
and lost to State. The first match
has a 23-9 loss and last year's
encounter resulted in a 16-16
tie.

“It’s going to be tough,” Ad-
ams feels, “They have tremen-
dous balance. No one weight

The well balanced State line-
up includes, Dave Weber. an un-
defeated sophomore at 118.

Wrestling at 134. is Dana Bal-
urn. third in the East last year.
Balum has tied with Lehigh's
Dave Icenhower this season, an
opponent whom Dave Wylie de-
feated. ' ‘

At 142, is Dick Kief, a nation-
al junior college champion, and
at 150 is Clyde Frantz, Eastern
Champ, third in the Nationals
and the outstanding wrestler in
the Easterns.

Don Stone is wrestling at 158.
Stone tied with Rick Bacastow
from Lehigh. Bacastow was a
runner-up in the ._ Easterns. At

defeated soph. Matter won the

At Skibo Tomorrow/v Afternoon

by ED CONLEY
and BILL NAAB

When Buzz Ridl talks about the
Panthers game against Carnegie-
Mellon at Skibo gym tomorrow at
2:30 p.m.. he seems to be re-
membering last years loss to the
Tartans. which included quite a
few boxing and wrestling matches.

"They beat us there last year.“
he said. _‘‘And they're a dangerous
team."

Of course. Ridl doesn't use the
terms "beat" and "dangerous“
with inference to the fisticuffs of
last seasons loss. He is simply
talking about the teams basket-
ball ability.

As in the past few seasons, the
quality of C-MU basketball had
been questioned this winter. Their
current record is 6-13, but they
have won their last three games.

Last Wednesday night they
edged Geneva. 72-65.

Their leading scorer Bob
Brown——who scored 19 points in
the Panthers’ 72-56 victory over
the Tartans earlier in the season
—missed the Geneva game be-
cause of the flu. He’ may not play
tomorrow.

Cleve Edwards, the Panther
guard who is known for his assists
rather than for his points, missed
the Panthers’ 75-56 victory
Wednesday night over Westmins-
ter because of the “Hong Cong”
flu, and he may also miss th
C-MU game. -

The Panthers fared pretty well
without Edwards at New Wilm-
mington. Pa.. against the Titans.
despite cold shooting in the first
half.

The Jungle Cats were not hit-
ting from the outside in the first
half. but still managed a 32-24
halftime lead. which developed
after a nine-minute drought of
field goals for the Titans during
the latter half of the stanza.

The Titans couldn’t get a field
goal in the first eight minutes of
the second half, either, and the
Panther margin increased to 52-

./-,_> '-

 

I

The lead remained stable
throughout the remainder of the
game. with the -Jungle Cats" big-
gest advantage coming near the
end. a 75-51 mark. The Titans
then scored five points at the close
of the encounter to cut the mar-
gin a bit.

"We started to get in some nice
shots under the basket in the sec-
ond half." Ridl said.."Most of our
scores came on lay-ups. ‘We hit
15 of 27 shots in the second
half—that's almost 56 per cent.
after a cold first half.

Mike Patcher led the Panther
attack with 13 points, replacing
the usual leader, Ken Scott, who
had 12 points, all in the second
half.

The only other Panther in dou-
ble figures was Paul O'Gorek with
10 points.

Two Titans reached double dig-
its. Gary Brown led the game in

scoring with 15 points and Randy
Huey swished for 11.

Ridl was surprised that the Ti-
tans didn't score a bit more often.

"I was somewhatsurprisedf‘
he said. "On their home court I
thought they‘d get momentum and
give us a good game. If they would
have shot like they did in their
winning ‘streak wseven onse‘cu~
tive wins. ending last week» they
would have."

The Panther record moved up
to 10-12. retaining hope for a .500
season with two games remain-
ing.

 Golden Flashes
G In Fimtl Meet

By JERRY MYERS

In their concluding meet of the season, the Pitt swim-
 mers host the talented corps from Kent State University in
 Trees Pool, tomorrow at2:00 p.m. ,

if The mermen. coming off of a stinging defeat at the hands of
 the Syracuse Orangemen 69-44. enter tomorrow's meet seeking their
fourth victory of the season. against five loses. The meet will again

According to Coach Grant.
"Kent State is the best team in
the Middle American Confer-
ence." The conference includes
such fine swimming schools as
Ohio University. West Michigan.
Bowling Green. and Marshall.‘
Last year Kent State swamped
the Panthers 66-47 as they took
ten out of thirteen events. Dave
Wessel took‘ both diving events
3 Year ago to give the mermen
two of their three first.

The Golder Flashes. accord-
ing to Coach Grant. are "on a
par with Maryland." and Mary-'
land already beat the mermen
quite handily earlier this sea-
son. Tomorrow's meet will come
down to some real tough swim-
ming.. _

Following Saturday’s meet
the swimmers prepare for the
Eastern "Championships. After
the Easterns come to the Na-

_tionals to wrap the competition

for the 1970 season.

As far as incoming freshmen
are concern Coach Grant said.
"the recruiting for next season
is coming along pretty fair. We
usually don‘t bother_ the high

‘schools during the regular sea-

son. We talk to the boys before
the season and then let them
come’, and see~a.few meets dur-
ing the year. The coaches don't
like us constantly botheringtheir
swimmers during their season."

With the addition of some
tough young freshmen the tank-
ers will gain some of the depth
they need. The area in which the
mermen have been burned most
this season is in their freestyle
events. Almost every opponent
has invaded Trees‘ Pool with a
fine set. of freestylers and that.
in addition to the failure to cap-
ture the relay events. has cost
the Panthers most of their five
defeats.

After 3rd Win

Gymnasts Meet Orange

By PETE NYCHIS

Coach Warren Neiger‘s gym-
nasts will try to close out the
season tomorrow on a winning
note when they host the Orange
of Syracuse.

A third victory has been hard
to come by for the gymnasts in
this second half of a dismal sea-
son. The last time the gymnasts
won was back on January 23
at Trees Hall against Kent State.
Since then defeat has dominated
the scene as Temple, Navy, Slip-
pery Rock, Massachusetts, and
Penn State, all in succession.
have been Victorious over the
gymnasts.

The scene should change some-
what tomorrow though because
Syracuse has had a more diffi-
cult time winning than Neiger's
team.

Both have yet to win in Eastern
Collegiate competition but that's
where any similarity ends. Syr-
acuse hasn’t even been able to
come up with a victory outside of
league competition while Neiger’s
have managed two
interleague victories.

Three victories for Neiger's
gymnasts will make the season
worthwhile even if it looks bad
on paper. They only won one last
year by barely edging West Vir-
ginia, 112.30-111.70.

Neiger said. "This year has
been a rebuilding year for us and
we‘re grateful to win two. Right
now our goal is set on winning
tomorrow and that’s all that
counts right now."

He also added, “This year we
expect to win three, of course
we’ve got to beat them tomorrow,
and next year we’re hoping on
at least five wins or more.”

Neiger also added that injuries
have played a big role in the team's
performance. He said, "Some
of our guys like Dave Andrew and
Phil Lilly are hurting. Dave’s legs
have been bothering him all seas-
on and Phil just hasn’t been able
to stay healthy. "You also can't
forget Ron Ludwig who was lost
for the whole season on account
of a leg injury. He looked good and
he could have really helped us
out, especially in the floor ex-
ercise."

The Syracuse lineup will be
probably looking like this: Harvey
Silverstein and Bob Cushman
(floor exercise), Tony DeStafano
and Pat McDonnel (side horse),
George Stalter and Martin Perl-
man (still rings), Silverstein,
Cushman, and Adsit (long horse),
Statler and Silverstein (parallel
bars), and Cushman and Wisman
(high bar).

Tomorrow will also be very
interesting to see who wins the
big showdown between first place
Springfield and second place
Massachusetts. If Springfield
wins, it clinches the Eastern
title. But if Massachusetts wins
they'll be in a good position to win
it. It will be do or die though in
U-mass’. next meet against Tem-
ple, who is in third place. If they
do beat Temple then it would
bring Massachusetts its first
title ever in Eastern gymnastics.

Independent Tilt Pits

Casers Vs. Trotters

The Law School Casers pulled
the upset of the season Wednes-
day night as they nipped the pre-
viously unbeaten Fidd1er’s No.
1. 46-45. In what coach Lee Rob-
erts termed a “fine team effort,"
the Casers managed to stave
off a final last minute come-
back by the Fiddlers to wrap up
a berth in the Independent League
finals.

The other spot in the champion-
ship game will be filled by the
Trotters, who dumped another
previously unbeaten team, the
D. E.’s 56-51.

The Casers won the right to
oppose the Fiddlers by whip-
ping the Schmidt Bros. 55-40 in
the League “B” playoff. Because
of their second place finish in the
rough "A” League, the Trotters
were eligible for the playoffs.

The Electrics downed the Mech-
anicals 38-29, to cop the Eng-

ineering division title. Ron Hau-
selman sparked the victors with
21 points in the championship
contest.

In Fraternity League “B” ac-
tion, Kappa Sigma captured the
crown with a perfect 8-0 record.
Their big victory came at the hands
of the Fiji’s 61-32. Ken O’Keefe’s
22 points paced the Kaps over the
strong Fiji’s.

A three way tie still remains
in Fraternity “A” competition.
Phi Kappa Theta beat Pi Lamda
Phi, 51-38, to maintain a 5-1 mark.
Delta Tau Deltakept pace with
them upending Sigma Chi 63-51.
Ray Barnhart, the Delt’s big gun,
led the winners with 25 points.

Phi Epsilon Pi, the third team
knotted up for the lead, squeaked
out a 44-38 victory over a battling
Zeta Beta Tau. The Eps had to
hold off a strong rally by the
Zeeb’s to stay alive for the title.
