Senate Council

Evaluation Vote Monday

BY MAGGIE McKAY

The Senate Council is expected to
respond to a University-wide plan
for student evaluation and faculty
development in teaching on Mon-
day.

The plan, drawn up by the
Committee on the Evaluation of
Teaching at the direction of the
Provost’s Ofﬁce, calls for the
establishment of formal, depend-
able student evaluation of courses
and teachers and a corresponding
self-evaluation by faculty members
along with a greater institutional
commitment to teacher develop-
ment and excellence.

In an effort to move Pitt towards

its goal -of teaching excellence, the ’

committee’s report recommends
the expansion and elevation of the
present Center for the Evaluation of
Teaching (CET) from the College of
Arts and Sciences to the provost’s
level. The general function of this
ofﬁce would be to conduct research
on the evaluation of teaching at Pitt
and_ to administer andreport the
results of various standardized
evaluations of teaching.

The report also recommends the
establishment of separate office for
faculty development in teaching to
aid faculty members in improving
their‘ teaching and to develop
programs and workshops for
teacher development at the Univer-
sity. It also proposes that personnel
decisions should include evalua-
tions of teaching-based on a wide

Final steps on the teaching
committee’s suggestions will be
taken by the provost’s ofﬁce after

Local Hospitals Seek

Radiotherapy Patients

BY NANCY J. WINTNER

Pittsburgh-area hospitals+—in~-
cluding two afﬁliated with the
University—are spearheading a
nationwide search for those people
who received radiation treatment
for enlarged thyroids, tonsils,
adenoids and ‘acne conditions

‘between 1935-55 for the possibility

of thyroid cancer.

Although there is no need for
urgent or immediate medical
evaluation, hospitals involved in the
program are notifying those people
in their 30s or 40s who received
treatments during that time. The
local hospitals—Allegheny Gener-
al, Mercy, Monteﬁore and Falk
Clinic———are suggesting the people
receive a medical examination.

Several smaller-scale clinics were
established, including ones in

I Milwaukee and Cincinnati, but the

largest programs are located in
Pittsburgh and Chicago.

Dr. Gilbert H. Issacs, chief of
Montefiore’s Nuclear Medicine
Unit and Thyroid Lab, said it’s a
very slow-developin g cancer and no
one should be alarmed.

“It takes years and years to

V develop,” said Issacs, associate

professor of clinical medicine at
Pitt. “And it’s only when it’s very
late in its course will it. spread. We
have time to deal with the health
problem. The important aspect is to
locate the people.”
Issacs said the cancer appears as
a small lump in the neck and the
vast majority of persons are
unaware that it exists. In most cases
it can only be identiﬁed through the
use of a simple, painless thyroid
scanning machine, a scintiscan.
According to Issacs, 20% of the
patients screened were found to
have the lump or nodule.

“Most (of the lumps) are benign’ ’
he added.

The cancer is curable and thyroid
hormone pillls are recommended or‘
surgery advised in certain cases.
Although surgery has proven to be
almost 100% effective, Issacs said
the doctors are “very conservative’ ’
in their decisions concerning
operations. ’

“If we ﬁnd someone has a single
nodule in the pre-clinical exam-

since the results of a December

_ Resident Student Association (RSA)
survey indicated residents believe
freshmen should make the conces-
sion their predecessors made.

Of 1,648 cafeteria patrons
surveyed, 67 percent believed
incoming freshmen should be
required to purchase a 19-meal-per-

The remaining 32 percent
thought incoming/freshman should

subsequent cost increase attached
to the ‘14-, 10- and 19- or S-

Michelle Sikora said the RSA will

investigate further the possibility of

meal plan options for incoming
freshman. \

In past years cafeteria manage-
ment has asserted the mandatory
freshmen meal plan maintains a
standard on which the food service
budget can be based, while the
number of 14-, 10-, and 5-
meal-per-week plans remain vari-
able.

An additional cost increase to the
upperclassman on smaller meal
plans, approximately 1 percent over
inﬂation increases, would compen-
sate for the base money lost by
offering freshman an option.

In addition, a price increase on ‘

the 14-meal-per-week-plan and a
slight decrease on the 19-meal-per-
week-‘plan would make both options
nearly equal in cost, creating a
somewhat stable base, Sikora said.

These ﬁgures, she added, were
based on the assumption half of the
freshman purchase 19-meal-per-
week-plans.

Programming Revisions
Promise Student Input

BY PAUL MATHEWS I

The undergraduate Program-
ming Committee revisions,
approved last month by the Student
Government Board (SGB), are the
first steps in an attempt to make the
Programming Committee more
responsive to the needs and
demands of various student organi-
zations, SGB member Larry Krain
said recently. ‘

“The revisions are the result of
longstanding structural problems
which gave no assurance of student
representation,” Krain said.

Krain said the revisions also are
an attempt to create a more
structured committee that can
provide a guarantee of accounta-
bility and responsibility.

ll He also said the revisions are only
a rough-draft proposal for improve-
ments in the Programming Com-
mittee’ s representation of students.

T‘The proposal still needs clariﬁ-

‘-cation at this point,” Krain said.

“For example, I think the
establishment of a steering com-
mittee is a good thing, but there are
still questions that need to be
answered about the limits of its role
as an overseer.”

Allocations Committee member
Dave Hesidence said the Program-
ming Committee is run by just a
small core of people who receive
little student input. “I think these
revisions will provide far more
outside input as well as a better
check on the representation of
student needs, ’ ’

Krain said the revisions still leave
plenty of room for the programming
Committee’s input.

Programming Committee mem-
bers generally are dissatisﬁed with
the revisions.

“We’re not saying a better
system can’t be evolved,” said
Programming Committee co-chair-
man Lou Lineman, “but we ﬁnd
these revisions to be very conﬁn-
ing.”l

Programming Committee mem-
ber Grant Lawson said the revisions
will make the committee inﬂexible if
the “well-organized” program-

ming calendar is put into effect.

“The nature of our business is such
that you can not plan a concert a
year in advance,” he‘ said. A

He said plans for almost any
concert, such as last term’s
Homecoming concert, are subject to
change at the last minute. “If the
Programming committee were
locked into an exact schedule, which
is next to impossible to arrange in
the first place, the student
programming package would likely
suffer,” Lawson said. I

“We also object to the fact that
there is no provision for a member
of the Programming Committee to

to Ray Steele, assistant to the

The extent to which the plan is
approved and the costs it might
incur can not be estimated until
after the Senate Council meeting,
Steele said. Costs to other universi-
ties for faculty development units
run as high as $400,000 (Penn State)
and as low as $50,000 (Kansas State
University).

The adoption of the committee's
proposals is extremely important
according to Committee member
Jack Daniels, because of the variety
of the student body at Pitt and the
necessity of teachers to adjust
teaching to its widely differing
background skills and needs.

one that clearly stands out—that
person goes to surgery. But we’re
not always sure. An increased
ﬁrmness,.an increased size (of a
gland) is not abnormal. But if the
scintiscan shows it, the person's
under observation.”

Issacs said a person who has a
lump is monitored for months or
years. If a substantial change occurs
in the size of the nodule, surgery
will then be advised. .

“Only when it’s larger and
demonstrating an increase in size,
then we can feel secure we should
have it out.”

Issacs said 10 percent have very
tiny thyroid malignancies which
never get much bigger. Conse-
quently, surgery is not immediately
advised.

“We’re aggressive in finding out
who these people are, but
conservative in what we’re doing.”

Because Pittsburgh has one of the
nation’s leading programs, CBS’
“60 Minutes” recently visited the
local hospitals to ﬁlm a special

concerning these thyroid clinics.
The film crew spent 5 days in the
city, of which 1‘/2 days were spent at
Monteﬁore. The special focused on
all aspects of the clinical programs.

A 1970 Pitt graduate, Alice
Backer, was one of two local

- subjects used in the special. Backer,
who received three thyroid treat-
ments in 1948, learned the results of
her examination along with CBS-—
during the actual take. Issacs, her
physician, informed hera nodule
was present.

Although Issacs originally recom-
mended the surgery, she decided
the thyroid hormone pill was a
“close-second alternative. ’ ’

“I don’t think surgery is
necessary,” said the 28-year-old
Backer. “I don’t think it should be
recommended in my case. It’s a
slow moving cancer and no one’s
ever died of thyroid cancer. They
don’t know if it’s benign or
malignant and they won't know
until it's removed.”

Asked if she was concerned about

her condition, Backer said, ‘,‘I’m not

concerned to the extent I'll run out
and have surgery next week. I’ll try
the thyroid pill and in the next three
to six months, I’ll make my
decision.” .

A former Pittsburgh resident,
Backer resides in White Plains,
New York and works as a computer
programmer for American Tele-
phone and Telegraph there. When
notified about receiving a medical
check-up, she decided to return to
the Pittsburgh doctors who she felt
were ‘ ‘better experienced.”

Backer said the purpose of the
special was to acquaint the nation
with the problem so that more
clinics would be established. The
program tentatively is scheduled to
air Jan. 10, according to Issacs.

Commentator Morley Safer inter-
viewed Backer, her mother and
Issacs and mentioned that it was
ironic that treatments for a disease

could be worse than the problem
itself.
Backer returned to White Plains

Programming co-chairman Andy
Coleman said. “Students from
other organizations don’t under-
stand what is involved in promoting
and producing a show and thus
often ask us to put on a concert that
is impossible to do,” he said.

Lawson also complained that the
revisions suggest a cut in the
Programming_Committee’s budget
in the face of rising costs. V

“I feel like the SGB has tied our ‘

Brown also said he thought the

Hospitals Seek Radioactivity Treatecl Patients

Asked if people currently receiv-
ing any therapeutic radiation
treatment should be alarmed,
Issacs said they should not. In the
1930s, he said, the vast majority
with serious conditions were better
off with radiation treatments, since
at that time surgery was “life
threatening.” There were no means
to deal with post-operative infec-
tion. But today, radiation is “better
controlled” and used only in areas
that are highly protected by special
devices such as lead shields.

“I would not want those advised
of — getting therapeutic radiation
scared of getting it. .If_it’s advised
it‘s doing something for the
illness."

Apparently, there was a relation-
ship between the amount of ,
radiation a person received and the

“likelihood of developing this

cancer. But. he said. doctors don't
know or may never know exactly
what this relationship is.

“Precautions today are more
stringent than in the early periods.
Everything in medicine is better.

‘ Therapeutic radiation is carried out

to help rather than hurt. It’s worth
the”bene\ﬁts to be gained.”

Issacs said a potential risk has
always been’ involved when using
therapeutic radiation. Back in the
1950’s doctors thought the risk of

-developing cancer could only last

ten years after the treatment. After

that a tumor could not develop.
“That’s what was predicted,” he

said. “But about two years ago a

report was published that the
danger did not end at ten years. The
risk continues for 35-40 years or
life.” I
Issacs said that using radiation
treatment then was like placing a

‘bet. “You were always taking a

chance. They tried to keep the risks
to zero and that’s how they tried to

win,” he said. “But they lost. The;

treatment had unfortunate
sults.”

Issacs stressed the cancer is ‘ ‘not
acute” and “death is rare.” The
danger of thyroid tumors, he said,
comes only from therapeutic
radiation which was delivered in
very high doses. It should not be
confused with diagnostic X‘FaYS
(such as chest X-rays.)

Issacs said Dr. Robert Carroll,
afﬁliated with" Presbyterian’s De-
partment of Nuclear Development,
was responsible for “getting the
program , off the ground as a
county-wide effort.” ~

“He stimulated the program
Issacs said, “and pulled data
between the hospitals. He had the
major role in cooperative effort
throughout the city.”

Issacs added that “Pittsburgh is

Smooth the Transition

Pitt’s Legal Awareness (LAC) is considering a status change. The
members want to resign their position as a standing committee of
Student Government and become a student organization. '

That sounds like a fresh idea, but actually it’s not. LAC has received
very little direct input from Student Government for the past few years.

Therefore, the proposed change is not really a change. But it could be
an improvement. What if_ the SGB did decide to direct. the Committee?
The slothfulness of previous administrations, exempliﬁed by their

inability to complete projects, would be more hindrance than help.

And the prevailing image of Student Government on campus makes it
easierfor a campus group to recruit students than it is for an arm of
Student Government. The extra freedom allowed a student organization
would aid other efforts, including recruitment.

No one doubts the need for a legal organization for students. Though
fewer students are being busted for drugs than had been the case, there
are hassles with Judicial Board defenses, arrests and landlord-tenant
displptes. These problems would provide the organization with plenty of
wor .. _

A smooth transition must be made from standing committee to
student organization. Because of the special nature of this committee, a
diiferentprobationary period should be provided."

Normally, a partially recognized group is budgeted a maximum of
$100 for its probationary year. LAC needs -$3,600 for its lawyers on

. _retainer, let alone other expenses. They must be provided enough

To get recognition, a group must have 25 active members. After
graduationinApril, LAC’s corps maynumber less tlianthat. But if they
 under the wing of Student Government, it is doubtful that they
could must enough members to become an organization.

The solution is to draw up a probationary period allowing LAC more
money and less membership than the ordinary partially recognized
group. Ifthe group can stand on its owntwo feet after one year, then the
transition hasbeen accomplished. Ifit can’t, the idea of an independent
organization should be re-examined.

But a Legal Awareness Student Organization is an idea worth trying.

Face the Issues

Petitions are due this afternoon for those wishing to secure ballot
position in this year’ s Student Government_ Board election. But getting
elected will entail more than getting on the ballot.

A candidate who wishes to be elected this year should have some fresh
solutions to the same old problems that have yet to be solved.

He or she should have a workable plan to deal with a tuition hike. Each
must plan to involve SGB in the ﬁght against campus  And each
should have a way to get involved with administrative decisions, without
alienating the administration. I g

The candidates should have a plan to make SGB more responsive to

The candidates should reﬂect. Do they have enough time to serve the
students? 9 Are they trying to serve the students or improve their
resume? Many Board members did not have enough time this year for
effective service. As a result, little was accomplished by the SGB.

Most importantly the candidates should struggle to improve SGB’s
rapport with the students. Can they get the Board and student body
working together again? That would be the noblist thing a candidate
could do. ‘ '

A successful candidate shouldbe prepared to examine the structure of
SGB with an eye for change, if needed.

Don't Waste Time on Apathy

BY DANIEL ANTION

I In the past few weeks the
number of articles written on
apathy has been increasing stead-
ily. Various people have pro-
claimed in print that Pitt students
have no spirit, pizazz or emotion.
Examples that have been cited
range from those in the classroom
to those at the football games.
There seems to be an actual
organized effort to arouse interest
in the placid students here at Pitt.

Who are the people in command
of this operation, these students
seeking to quell indifference? Are
they the first of a new breed of
mankind? Perhaps they are some
sort of activistic throwback to the
rehellous subculture of the late 60s.
Maybe their rabble-rou'sing efforts
are tribute to. the revolutionary
spirit in this. our bicentennial year.
These are all nice ideas but the
unfortunate truth is, today’s
radicals are merely concerned
people lacking a common cause.
That shouldn’t come as a surprise,
after all. the good causes have been
used up. -

-Back abouttwentyl years ago it

was very easy to become “in-

/ volved." Hell, then, one evenhad

to choose between issues. One
could either join groups intent on

exposing communist activity. or I

travel about promoting the con-
struction of fallout shelters. When
the cold war ended. the new
morality of the early 60s ﬁlled the
void. Then only ﬁve years later
these activists were treated to a
real life-and-death issue, Viet
Nam!‘ The mid ’60s were a
protester dream come true. So
many issues were available; civil
rights. the war in Indochina, the
_’68 elections, pollution, the draft,
the list went on. This multitude of
causes inspired countless marches,
moratoriums, sit-ins, walk-outsiand
overthrows. Then, in the early
'70s, the balloon began to deflate;
the elections and Watergate
provided only a short-lived reprise.
Suddenly, it was over; as quickly as
they had been thought up. the
goals had been reached or the
causes forgotten. The past few
years have yielded nothing.
Now those of die-hard character

have sought to rally support for the
most absurd cause of all. Concern!
Generating interest among the
passive will not be an easy task.
Apathy is not vunerable to case
proven and civil methods of attack.
It doesn’t seem likely that a law will
ever be passed making it illegal to
remain content. And inert beings,
byinature, don't gather in"crowds
large enough to be protested or
picketed. But don't assume that
these strong-willed individuals will
stop atthe law's end. Violent
methods of attack. It doesn't seem
likely that a law will ever be passed
making it illegal to remain content.
And inert beings. by nature, don’t
gather in crowds large enough to
be protested or picketed. But don't
assume that these strong-.willed
individuals will stop at the law's
end. Violent methods have been
used before in desperation, and
these surely are desperate times.
No doubt they will start with
moderately disobedient tactics.
Uninspiring course such as history
or social science will be subject to
student boycotts during ﬁnals
week. If that fails they probably
kidnap the golden girls and release
them only after university ac-
ceptance of the Doctrine of
Involvement. This doctrine would
bar from the curriculum any course
offered ‘by a department not
currently involved in active re-
search. It also would set up new

priorities for the allocation of
‘funds. Heading the new list would
be varsity ‘sports, followed by
physical education and the pure
sciences. Should they require still
more attention, they certainly will
have to employ drastic means. The
administration building for the
most apathetic major, perhaps
business, will be destroyed by ﬁre
or explosion. Then, recognition
will be gained.

Though possible. this would all
be most unnecessary. The
students seeking a direction in
which to channel their energy
should concentrate on themselves.
Why should _the select few people
possessing real concern waste it on
those who don't give a damn?
Instead they should adopt the goal
of the past generation. That highly
idealistic idea that man can better
himself without limit. By seeking
such a unattainable goal. one
assures himself of never being
satisfied. Dissatisfaction in strong
people gives ride to motivation and
motivation turns ability and know-
ledge into success.
never-ending cycle; as ‘more things
are gained. still more are desired.

Inspired people will reach great_

height while the meek and content
will muddle endlessly at the
bottom. So leave the weak to their

history books and their archives:

«there is too much life to enjoy to
wastetime on fools.

Can Pitt be Open At
Off-Campus Meetings?

According to your last issueiof
the fall trimester, university
planning for the future will be the
subject of an “off-campus senior
staff meeting" to be attended by
the Chancellor and those who work
at the vice-chancellor level. They
will consider the replies of deans
and heads of academic units to the
question of how they might deal
with the prospect of fewer students
and less money. Using his most
reassuring tone. vice-chancellor
Freeman says the planning docu-

ment being used as the basis for
such questions is only a. “think
piece" which does not make policy;
no action will be taken before
discussion at “appropriate"
administrative and faculty levels.
At least four aspects of this
situation are worth comment:

1. Your article was dated
December 10. almost an entire
month after administrative heads
were required to nominate depart-
ments or programs for potential

future demolition. So much for the
“openness" of our administration.

2. Freeman's outline of what will
Iiappen is a textbook example of
how not to manage any organiza-
tion. The worst thing so-called
“leaders" can ever do is to take a
position on what should be done
before undertaking the promised
“substantial amount of discus-
sion." In such situations,
“leaders" almost always refuse to
admit they may have erred in
committing themselves to a course
of action. Others involved in such
“discussions” hesitate to disagree
because the disagreement will be
taken as personal criticism of the
leaders. So much for the
administrative competence we get
for the lush salaries paid our
administrators.

3. The gathering of the “senior
staff" in an “off-campus” meeting
usually means that the university’s
liquor closet (and presumably
bartender) will be in attendance so
that the discussions will be Suitably
lubricated. So long as “retrench-
ment" is becoming the dominant
theme, perhaps the entertainment
budget should be one of the first
items “retrenched." The univer-
sity can do without the imagery of
Henry VIII gorging himself while
planning executions.

4. The “University Plan,” the
“think piece" to which Freeman
referred, and the many’ other
projects being developed in his
office virtually guarantee that as
the university, “shrinks.” the size
of the administrative ‘staff will
constantly increase. We already
have so many “vice-chancellors,"
etc., that the senior administrators
of the university are effectively
isolated from students, staff and
faculty. This isolation, typiﬁed by
the “off-campus meeting," does
not bode well for the future.

Sour Notes On

Piano Story

To correct and clarify the article
“RSA Charges Student With Piano
Damage” in the Wednesday, Dec. 8
issue of the Pitt News, this letter is
being written. In fact, at present,
the Damage Control Committee
(DCC) is recommending to the
Housing Office that a Tower B
resident be invoiced for the
damages to the baby grand piano in
the Tower A Conference Room. The
mistake in the Wednesday, Dec. 8
issue read “the RSA damage
control committeee will bring
Judicial Board charges against a
Pitt student for damage done to a
piano in the Tower A Lounge. ’ ’ This
is a totally incorrect statement; no
such action has been made.

Apparently the author and
editors. of the article did not
understand DCC procedure.
Following is a brief but correct
explanation. of the procedure the

DCC follows in any damage case.

First, the damage is discussed at
our meetings, which are held every
other week at a prearranged time. If
the damage warrants looking into, a
subcommittee, usually two or three
members, is appointed to investi-
gate the case. During the
investigation a meeting may be

arranged with any key witnesses or '

suspects, the DCC subcommittee
and a Housing Office representa-
tive. It is important to note that the
DCC subcommittee represents the
students in such a case, so that no
undue pressure is put on a student.
With the DCC subcommittee
present, the Housing Office repre-
sentative does not intimidate the
student. I '
After a thorough intestigation,

the. subcommittee must submit a
formal written report to the DCC
along with a recommendation for
further action.’ Recommended
action may include billing a student,
not billing a student, dropping the
case, or whatever may come from
specific case. The recommendation
is discussed among the DCC
members, and aivote decides what

recommendation will be passed on
the Housing Office.

For example, if the subcommittee
feels that a student is responsible
for certain damages, they recom-

mend to the entire DCC that‘ a‘

suggestion be made to the Housing
Office to invoice the student.

The decision of the DCC is not final,
"it is a recommendation to the
Housing Office. The Housing
Office then weighs all the
information an-d recommendations,
and acts accordingly.

If a student is billed, he or she has

ten days in which either to accept
the bill, or return to the Housing
Office stating that it is not accepted.
If the bill is rejected, then the
Housing Office may decide that
Judicial Board action is appropri-
ate, or they may decide to drop the
case. ’

If Judicial Board action is taken, it
becomes the responsibility of the
DCC to act as complainant, and the
student will be the defendant.

At present, in the case of the
damage to the piano, the DCC is at
the stage of recommending to the
Housing "Office that a Tower B
resident bexbilled for the damage to
the piano. Any other information is
incorrect.

As for the misconception in the
Wednesday, Dec. 8 article, we hope
this letter clarifies the procedure of
the Damage Control Committee.

We regret any embarrassment to.

the parties involved, and hope that
the correct procedure is under-
stood.

Let's Rid Pitt
Of Proselytizers

In thepast few weeks there have ,

been a few young men going around
the campus with a religious
questionnaire. They approach you
in the halls and ask you if you want
to answer their questions. This
seems very innocent at first, so
there is no reason to say “no”, but

all of a sudden you are asked very
personal questions about your
belief. They then explain why they

. are asking you these questions. It

seems that they have found “new
life” through the realization that
Jesus was the Savior. They,
therefore, feel it their responsibility
to convince you of this by any means
possible, including showing one
supposed Biblical proof of this. I
consider this missionary work and
don’t think it should be allowed
actively on campus.

If they really want to show people
a “new light,” without causing
embarrassment to anyone, they can
set themselves up in a corner
somewhere and let those interested
come to them. Let’s face it, human
nature shows that once you are
approached it is pretty hard for you
to say “no” . So if we - the students -

would be given the choice of having .

this interview or not, the whole idea
would be much less offensive.

I feel that all groups interested in
inﬂuencing people on campus
should have to do it passively and
not actively. This is doubly true in

the case of religion, which is a very‘

personal affair. This is because in
religion as opposed to other areas,
people have very different concepts
of what constitutes religion. It is,
therefore, up to us, the students, to
ask the questions and decide how to
worship, and not for someone to tell
us what to do.

More Support
For Prof Ali

Recently, it was revealed that the
University of Pittsburgh has
decided not to renew the contract of
Assistant Professor Yusef Ali.-. The
reason for this decision remains
unclear to most, precisely. because
the challenge presented is ' so
obviously outlandish.

Professor Ali has worked hard on
and off campus. On campus he had
organized easy to comprehend and
well documented classes indicting
racism on a national and interna-
tional scale. In the community he
has worked for these same goals,
thus projecting a consistency rarely
seen in university professors. I

As a former student of Professor
Ali’s, I was saddened at the news of
his dismissal. I found the clumsy
explanations for that dismissal
almost incomprehensible.

It is my hope that the students at
this university will ﬁght in their own
best interests to retain Professor Ali
for another three years. And in
doing so we will greatly add to the
credibility and authority of the
Black Studies Department.

It Lurks

A BY HARRY PARAS

Have you ever moved into an
Oakland apartment? _ Usually,
when you move into any apart-
>ment, it is unoccupied. That is.
nobody’s living there. And that is
what I thought when I rented an
ﬂapartment on Atwood Street. But,
gradually, I realized that I was not
moving into an uninhabited house.

Although my friends and I were
renting the second and third floors,
we decided to take a grand tour of
_the whole house, which simply
meant using a credit card on the
first-ﬂoor door (tight security)‘.

After ﬂicking on the light, I’

thought some crazy college stu-

, dents must have lived in this place
. because thousands of little black
‘polka dots were painted on the

white (actually yellow) walls. I
closed the door, but when I turned
around again, the black dots had
disappeared. Aside from this
strange occurence, the apartment
was normal; dry-rotted curtains,
white stuffing spilling out of tears
in the matresses, and a hole in the
kitchen wall. »

gtiﬁ Pﬁun Lift:

My own apartment wasn’t half
bad. except for numerous basket-
ball-sized dust balls and the fact
that the toilet bowl was brown,
yellow and green and had tiny
plants growing inside it.

Well, one day as I was eating
lunch and reading the Pitt News, I
was about to take another bite from
my sandwich when I noticed a big,
black cockroach sitting (im the
sandwich and staring at me. Its
antennae, long and slimy-looking,
squiggled about the piece of bread.

Repulsed, I dropped the sand-
wich. The cockroach flitted
across the floor and vanished into a
baseboard.

My roommates assured me that
they had not seen any cockroaches,
and that it must have been a stray.
That night I couldn’t sleep. Every
time I felt an itch or a tingle on my
leg or face or hair, I would sit up in
bed and inspect myself for roaches.
The thought of one crawling on my
face or in my mouth drove me
crazy. 1

After spotting several more, and
of course, my friends seeing none, I
tried an experiment. I went into

Every day, as you trudge from
class to class, you see thousands of
dazed," buggy-eyed faces passing
by. Did you ever wonder who these
mysterious people are, these people
who seem to swarm around campus
like ﬂies on a dead carcass? Did you
ever wonder who these poor souls
are who zip by you day after day?

We’ll introduce you to a few of
them.

Sharon Biglow, a ' stunning,
blonde-haired junior, studies
speech pathology here at Pitt.
What’s speech pathology? As
Sharon explains, “You know,
teaching people to say r’s and s’s
without a lithp.”

Her pasttimes are painting, going
to parties and walking around
campus waiting for jerks from the
Pitt News to interview her.

Next we see Mike Greene, a
speech communications major who
takes his sounds seriously. “Living
conditions on campus are really sad.

Every time your neighbor plays his
box (stereo) - you hear his as well as
your own.” And we sympathize
with him. But there are ways to
remedy the problem, Mike. For
instance, you could buy a set of
headphones. Or, better yet,
purchase a rapid-ﬁre machine gun.

Mike Wilson and Fran Staab,
here shown repairing deteriorating
stones on the Cathedral, were
reluctant to take time out from their
work to answer questions. “We are
kind of busy,” they insisted.
“There are lots of nice-looking
women going to class right now, and
we don't want to miss them.’ ’ Sorry
fellas. We didn’t mean to distract
you from your work.”

This last chap was curt and
snappy when we approached him in
Hillman Library. He barked out a
few words about having to go teach
a philosophy class, and deﬁantly
lifted _ his left leg to show his
disrespect for journalism. Whoever

the bathroom, turned out the light
and began pounding on the walls
and screaming for a cockroach to
dare show itself. When I turned
the light back on, to my surprise,
not one but a half dozen were
clinging to the walls, perched there
like they were su.n-bathing.

I yelled, and punched one,
squishing it right onto the wall.
Grabbing some toilet paper, I
crunched two more between my
fingers. squeezing them like
pimples until they popped. The
others scurried away.

Having spent two weeks in
cleaning the apartment, the last
thing I wanted was cockroaches. I
hate ﬁlth. Cockroaches love ﬁlth.
They spread disease, they can
contaminate your food and they
look unsightly when you entertain
guests. S

Big ones look like miniature
crickets, and the females lay thirty
eggs at a time. I heard that in one
Oakland apartment this term a
coacroach was so huge that it was
unkillable, even after repeated
beatings with shoes and bats.
Soon, the tenants had to sleep with
guns by-their beds.

But I was not one to let these
bugs take over my domain,
especially since they didn’t help
out on rent (it’s suprising that
landlords haven't figured out a way

to make Oakland bugs pay rent).

My roommates didn’t seem too
upset.‘ “Cockroaches have to have

likewise he sees another similarity

LOS ANGELES (AP)—*Louise
Lasser, te1evision’s “Mary Hart-

spot Tuesday in Mr. Blackwell's list
ofthe 10-worst dressed women. He
said she resembled “last summer’s
tumbleweed, tumbleweed. ”

“Tumbleweed picks up every
little piece of dust,” the fashion
designer explained, referring to the
paranoid cleanliness of the charac-
ter Miss Lasser plays in her comic
soap opera. 1

Others prominent on Blackwell's
17th annual list included singer-
dancer Charo, “a rumble seat with a

pushed-up front;” socialite Lee
Radziwill - “Did Lee’s designer go
down with the Titanic?” - and
country singer Loretta Lynn - “The

‘right dress in the wrong century.”

Blackwell, a fashion designer,

said he studied the women for the
entire year and based his selections
on clothes they chose themselves,
not on those worn as costuming for a
show. »
He said of incoming First Lady
Rosalynn Carter: “She is a very
nicely dressed woman. She has
nice, soft taste.”

The best dressed women, Black-
well said, are former California

  '76: Good For Newcomers

Editor’s note: Three of the arts .

department’s music reviewers offer
their comments on the music of 1976
and selections of last year’s
outstanding performances.

BY JIM FARERI

1976 seems to me a landmark

‘ year for contemporary music. It saw
the stagnation of many established
top performers, the failure of
current favorites to produce fresh.
material, the launching of new faces
to stardom and the fruitless

attempts of good progressive bands .

to win attention.

' Big names like Led Zeppelin, The
Who, Black Sabbath, Uriah Heep,
Jethro Tull, Eric Clapton, Lou Reed
and Elton John issued less-than-ex-
ceptional albums and consequently
lost (more) fans. And in ’76 even the
Stones are slipping, being told that
theyhdon’t know when to quit.

The shells of former greats, like
Mott and Deep Purple, pushed on
while ex-band leaders such as Ian
Hunter and Steve Marriott attempt-
ed to ﬂy solo. Some superstars took
’76 off: Bowie, Springsteen and
Emerson, Lake and Palmer.

Tlietrend for in-vogue bands was
to steer a steady course and for the
ti I being forget about change.
Th  especially applies to hard rock
and bands like Aerosmith and Kiss.
Tragisitional albums both succeeded
(Blgie Oyster Cult, Fleetwood Mac)
and failed (Doobie Brothers).

The year saw two miracles. In the
ﬁrst half of ’76 it was the outrageous
success of a live album by a-
gentleman who has been around

quite unnoticed, Peter Frampton.

The other miracle was Boston, a
completely unheard-of band whose
debut LP of polished hard rock
sounded and sold like the group had
been around for years:

Frampton’s success made this a
year of live albums, the best of
which is probably Wing’s three-
record set with Lynyrd Skynyrd’s
effort a close second.

But perhaps the most disturbing
thing that can be said of music in ’76
is also the most relevant. The public
is dismissing an older generation of
performers, but in their place are

  

substituting only few new faces who

are ‘doing basic-ally the same
material._ What sold Boston was not
innovation, but much tighter

production of the same old song and
dance.

Gary Gilmore And
  TV: A Star Is Born

BY RON NYSWANER

Last Wednesday, NBC aired a forceful and frightening report on
violence in America which included an account of the use of violence in

American arts, such as television and films. Both artforms package and ,

present violence as entertainment to their massive audiences.
The film industry has its Charles Bronsons and Clint Eastwoods, both
of whom often do bang-up business at the box ofﬁce.

Thisgeads me to the category of
quite awhile, but until ’76 was also nouveau ‘rock musicians who_ have
been mostly neglected for their
efforts. Their success is artistic, not
ﬁnancial, and their aim is to secure
music's growth, not stunt it.

  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
   
    
     
      
    
   

Pictured are some of the
outstanding artists and albums of
1976. Clockwise from above:
Queen, David Bowie, Be Bop
Deluxe, Jeff Beck’s Wired, and
Sparks’ Big‘Beat. '

From out of this group I select
Be-Bop Deluxe’s two similar
releases, Sunburst \‘Finish and

Modern Music as two of my favorite
pieces of work for ’76. Be-Bop
Deluxe is a space age-romantic
band whose melodic-moody blend

of music makes it the most original
rock band on earth.

My third choice is Patti Smiths:
recently released Radio Ethiopiﬁ.
Smith has released rock from being
a purpose in itself and makes it the
tool of a higher poetic purpose: what
ensues for the listener is sheer
anarchical pleasure.

Lastly, Sparks’ Big Beat album
deserves recognition as a fusion of
rock, pop and high energy.

Is there hope for the original in
1977? Of course, Bowie and Roxy
Music have made it in the past, but
the way up is no bed of roses.

  

BY M PATCK MONAHAN

1976 was a good year for
contemporary music. It was -the
year of super albums from artists
who had toiled for years with just
loyal cult followings (Peter Framp-
ton, Fleetwood Mac, Steve Miller,-
Boz Scaggs and Blue Oyster Cult).

Gilmore’s death quest is frightening, and even more so are various
responses to it. More than 200 people applied for a position on Gilmore’ s
ﬁring squad, and all three television networks have asked for permission
to film it. One network has threatened to ﬁlm from a helicopter or blimp
if permission to the execution site is denied.

Gilmore’s moment (literally) in the limelight might make for the
networks a highly rated television special, and create in Gilmore a
celebrity of major importance. The show might even be entitled ‘ ‘A Star

Is Shot. ”

The decision to ﬁlm Gilmore’s death—-reminiscent of the SLA—Los
Angeles police department shoot-out that was telecast live in

L.A.--goes far beyond poor judgment.

recklessness with which network
persuasive television air-time.

It is an example of the

Putting My Mother the Car on the air was bad taste. Broadcasting

Gilmore’s shooting is an assault.

Television, certainly not gun shy, brings its Starskys, Hutches,
Kojaks and Barettas into millions of American homes. Parents and
children can pass the potato chips as they watch Farah Fawcett-Majors,
one of prime time’s Charlie’s Angels, beat the hell out of roller derby
skaters and other nasty people with whom she is called upon to battle.

Most recently, television executives latched onto a new star whose TV
career may be a spectacular one, albeit short-lived. His name: Gary
Gilmore.

COMMENT

Gilmore, relatively unknown a few months ago, alfeady has
contributed heavily to the entertainment media. His act, a one-man
quest for a legal death, is fodder for reporters and magazine editors.
Gilmore has appeared in Time so often the editors could give him his
own section.

It may be pointed out that the networks are only serving their
public—if violent programming is what the public wants to see. The
problem here is that this question has not yet been resolved not even by
psychologists and sociolists who are studying it. It is not yet known
whether humans like s.w.a.t. or hockey game ﬁghts because of some
inherent characteristic or because we are taught to do so.

Yet network executives, with Gilmore waiting in the wings, are eager
to broadcast his disturbing end. Either they feel sure in their knowledge
of their audience’s psyche, or they simply are indifferent.

Network policy-makers insist that violence in programming is simply
a reﬂection of an aspect of our society. However, it is evident that
television's use of violence extends beyond observation to exploitation,
glamorization and consequently, approval.

Television decision-makers pretend to be unaware that they may be
contributors to the problem they simultaneously observe. Their interest
in broadcasting Gilmore’s execution is an arrogant example of their
apathy. _

It was the year of young upstarts
such as Boston and Heart scoring
heavily with debut albums. "It was

the year when established super-
stars such as the Led Zeppelin,
Black Sabbath and the Eagles,
released mediocre albums in light of
past accomplishments. It was the
year of Kiss. The year of the disco
craze.

In fact, there were so many
different styles of -music, released
by so many different artists, that it
would be impossible to name or
discuss the impact each one had on
the contemporary music year 1976.

But no matter what your taste, I
think it would be a safe bet to say
that it was covered by somebody.
So, proceeding with these special
limatations, here are my picks of the
best records released in the record

year 1976.

Wired by Jeff Beck: From the
ﬁrst time I heard Jeff Beck’s
dazzling guitar-playing on the
Yardbird’s “Shapes of Things”
nearly 10 years ago, Iknew that the
man had a special talent for playing
visionary guitar.

And after ten years of listening to
Beck, I’ve come to one conclusion.
Beck isn’t the fastest or the prettiest
guitarist around; he just plays
further and with more feeling than
any rock guitarist alive.

His experimentation with feed-
back and fuzztone riffs, the cool
British rock-star look and cocky
attitude, have also made him a
legend among budding rock guitar-
ists. Ask any of the fresh guitar crop
who they learned their licks from,
and nine times out of ten Beck will
be the number-one name on the list.

However, commercial sucess
eluded him until he released Blow
by Blow, in 1975, a jazz/rock-orient-
ed instrumental guitar album that
brought "him his ﬁrst gold record.

: Beck’s 1976 follow up, Wired,
 f continued in the same vein.

No longer faced with the sticky
problem of ﬁtting in his hot guitar
passages between a singer’s vocals,
his playing was placed right up
front, where it belongs.

On Wired, ex-Mahavishnu Orch-
estra members keyboardist Jan
Hammer and drummer Michael
Walden complement Beck nicely.

Both are on Beck’s level as

musicians, and their composing of
the majority -of the songs on the
album frees Beck to concentrate on
his guitar. A wise choice.

Wired is the best guitar album of
the year. Beck helped revolutionize
the electric guitar in the ’60s, and
with Wired, it’s obvious that he’s
on the move again in the ’70s.

Rocks by Aerosmith: The boys
from Boston, Aerosmith, have
pulled off a musical revolution of
their own over the last three years.
Heavily inﬂuenced by the rockers
from the ﬁrst English invasion
(Beck, the Rolling Stones and the
Beatles), they are the deﬁnitive
practitioners of third generation
hard rock.

Rocks is the best rock’n’roll
album of the year, and an accurate
reflection of where hard rock is
moving in the future. As individual
players, the members of Aerosmith
are not overly endowed musicians.
But as a band they come up with
perhaps the nastiest, most energe-
tic hard rock sound of any band from
the current crop.

Rock’n’roll has always been,
ideally, a substitute for sex.
Aerosmith is well aware of the fact
Rocks is sleazy, well produced and

A Night At the Opera by Queen:
After my initial listening to Night At

exceedingly high quality, the
operatic vocals and overdubs,
seemed to be layered on to a
ridiculous length, some of the songs
were trite, and the music seemed to

‘lack energy.

for instance, the phenomenal rise of
newcomers Heart and various
others. Couple that with mediocre
releases by McCartney, the Stones,

. . . Grgurich Going?)

BY CRIS HALL
It was a curious atmosphere that pervaded Pitt’s locker room after
Wednesday night’s nine-point loss to West Virginia at the Field House,

especially given recent history.

‘ The players for this 2-9 team, who had brooded and contemplated

gsometimes tothe point of tears after earlier losses, were surprisingly
*-%and refreshingly at- ease. They congratualated each other and even

smiled occasionally. They had lost, but it wasn’t the end of the world
because they had gone down, well, swinging.

Coach Tim Grgurich, however, who had predicted great things for this
team and its players this season, was down. Down enough to suggest

that he and Pitt basketball, which has been a large part of this man’s life

“They’re going to be great,” Grgurich said‘ of his inexperienced
Panthers. “I just hope we’re all still around to see them.” A

An obvious follow-up question to thatanswer is, might Tim Grgurich
and an assistant coach or two be the “we?” '

“My loyalty is to the program,

said Grgurich. “If our program

needs a shot in the arm from someone else...” .

Several persons close to the Pitt program have privately observed that
one result of a bad season could be Grgurich’s resignation. It hasn’t
gotten that bad yet, but Grgurich may just have added his name to that

group of doomsayers.

His team, however, refused to bask in the gloom that ordinarily has‘
enveloped its locker room this season. Their expressions were bright,
their utterances hopeful; they looked forward to coming harvests and
cast aside their recent remorseful ways.

' “Things are coming along,” said freshman center Mike Rice, whose
15-point, 14-rebound performance made him, with Sonny Lewis, appear
the nucleus of Pitt’s hope for the future. “Now I just have to try and
maintain my concentration for the whole 40 minutes. If I can do that, I’ll

be all right. ‘

‘ “In our ﬁrst couple of games, ’ ’ Rice continued. ‘ ‘I hadn’t adjusted to
the amoeba defense—it’s a hard one to learn. I was always one or two
steps behind..‘.'always too late underneath. But now, I’m coming along
with it pretty good. Because of that, my offense is improving, also."

Ed Scheuermann, the 6-11 ﬁrst-year center, agreed that the mentally
taxing amoeba was a large source of Pitt’s early problems. “A lot of

and that killed as.” v

I times I didn’t know who my man was...that.led to a lot of breakdowns,

Grgurich has put many of his eggs in three especially youthful
baskets this season, and the awkward, gangly seven-footling may be

ready to spread his wings.

Scheuermann, though bothered by a

recurrent attack‘ of the flu, didn’t miss a shot while collecting ten points
and six rebounds. He appears to be about 25 pounds away from being

in gear quickly. but the young Cats
soon experienced a “flat spot," as
they often seem to do when they
get the lead in a ball game. and the
Mountaineers stormed back as a

count at 20-20. A jumper by
standout guard Tony Robertson
gave head coach Joedy Gardner's
outfit a 22-20 lead. _ *

The Panthers enjoyed their
biggest lead at 36-30 as Sonny
Lewis stuffed a follow-up shot on
his way to a brilliant career-high
23-point performance. Some costly
turnovers hurt the Panthers as the
first half wound to a close, and
WVU took advantage of every Pitt
error to carry a 45-39 lead to the
locker room at halftime. '

The Mountaineers‘ held leads
varying from four to eight points
throughout most of the ﬁrst ten
minutes of the second half until the
Panthers made a run at them with A
eight minutes remaining, drawing
within two points on several
occasions, the last of which was at
72-70 on a Lewis jumper.

Once again turnovers took their
toll, however, as Robertson’s
back-to-back layups gave the
Mountaineers a nine-point advan-
tage with three minutes remaining,
a lead they never relinquished.

Grgurich seemed unusually
relaxed as he talked with reporters
after the game.

“We really tried to stay out of

Mike Rice led the Panther

Lewis, who connected on 9iof 15

praise.

“I was very pleased with
Sonny's total game." said
Grgurich. “But our defense needs
a lot of work. Anytime you score 91
points. it should be enough to win a
basketball game.”

Larry Harris also tallied 23 points
for the Panthers, but 10 of them
came after the game was out of

  Wrestling Re-sioux-mes

BY JIM LEWIS

Even John Wayne would ﬁnd
them tough.

The Pitt wrestling team-——the
18-ranked, unbeaten Pitt wrestling
team—-—has acted more like Coman-
chies than the young warriors they
are this season. and will continue
on their warpath tomorrow when
they attempt to ambush the
University of Buffalo Bulls in frost
upstate New York. *

The Panthers, with three im-
pressive wins against Akron,
Maryland and Bloomsburg so far,
climbed into the national spotlight
after creeping up on Bloomsburg
and scalping the helpless Bisons.
23-13, at the Field House way back
on December 11.

“Bloomsburg has a well-
balanced team." said Head Coach

Dave Adams. “They were the best I

of the ﬁrst three teams we played.
I was pleased with the win———we
started to do things we weren't
doing. We were more aggres-
sive."

Indeed they were, especially Jim
Gordon (158 pounds’), who was
named the outstanding wrestler of
the match. and All-American
Rande Stottlemyer, who was called
upon to win an extremely important
match against an undefeated Bison
wrestler two weight classes above
his own.

“We weren't planning on using
him," Adams explained. “But
because of injuries. we had to call
on him and puthim in at 150. He did
a great job-—-he wrestled a. very
smart match.” _

Can a smart team performance be
expected against Buffalo? Well,
since the Bulls were last year’s
Eastern Wrestling’ League cellar-
dwellers. a very. very smart
performance—perhaps verging on
genius——can be expected. right?

Normally. yes. But things aren't
quite up to normal for Adams and
his squad right now. The tribe
seemed to have enjoyed the
holidays a little too much, resulting
in overweight wrestlers.

“I'm disappointed that we didn't
come back in better shape,"
Adams said sadly. Wemay have to
shift our lineup around. I don't
think we'll be-up to snuff against
Buffalo."

Which means that tomorrow's

contest will be closer than matches

with the Bulls have been in the
past. matches in which Pitt would

come way out on top with ai

complete set'of shrunken heads.

Despite the ‘weight problem,
though. the starting lineup looks
basically the same——Bill Clark
(118). Jackie Cline (126). Stottle-
myer (a possibility at 134), Ed
Bredniak (142), Kevin McNamara
or Mark Popiolkowski (150), Jim
Gordon (158), Skip Bolin (167), Don
Ardnt (177). Bill Bailey (190) and
Mark Stepanovich (hwt).

All in all. Adamslooks for a
challenging match.

“We'll just have to do what it
takes. and just do the job."

And with good aim. the
Panthers’ barage of arrows could
hit a Bulls’ eye. "

BY PATTY. TASCARELLA

Judging from last season's
record. it was not unforeseeable
that the Pitt Hockey Club would be
,cruising along with an acey 5-1-1
record. but when you consider that
the team has done without the
services of long-time superstar
Rick Vernon. the whole thing
seems a bit farfetched, improbable.
and maybe even miraculous. Or
does it?

About this time last year. the
Panthers added center (Tom
Sherwin to the line-up, and if his
impact wasn't noticable then.
Sherwin is making up for it now.
Especially since the game plan has
shifted from the Vernon one-man
show to a total team effort, which

has been Sherwin's type of game

since he began playing hockey six
yearsago and which speciﬁcally
earmarked his style during his

career at Hampton High.

Not that Sherwin is any slouch
when it comes to scoring: midway
through the season. he's slammed
home 11 goals and collected 18
assists. And with last year's
freshman whiz. Curt Hetz. contin-
uing his hot shooting, Pitt remains
a balance offensive threat. The big
change is in attitude.

“There is definitely more team
unity," Sherwin said. “Instead of
just being like a club, it's more like
a sport team. We have a lot of
pride; we don't plan on being
defeated again this whole year."

Panther Coach Len Barcalow
agrees that Sherwin was a team
player from the start.

“Tommy is all hockey. He's IQO
per cent hockey on the ice and off
it. You could call him a hockey
player's hockey player." he said.
“He skates well. goes into the

corner and when he comes out of.

the corner,’ he's usually got that
puck with him."

Unlike many of his teammates.
Sherwin rarely spends time in the
penalty box. But even so. the
scrappy sophomore has had his
share of hard knocks. During the
team's trip to New York. Sherwin
got knocked about so badly that he
required 29 stitches ‘in his gashed
chin--“He didn’t complain, but it
hurt like the devil,” Barcalow
recalled--but he stayed on the ice
for the duration of the game.

To Sherwin, the strongest
memory of the season is that single

faces Bucknell at Trees Pool

tomorrow, 2 p.m., in what will be
truly a Test (with a capital “T”).
Bucknell, the defending Atlantic
Coast Conference champion, is
deemed “possibly the best dual
meet team we’ve ever had at Pitt”

by Panther head Coach Dick‘

Bradshaw and is a threat to marr
Pitt's impressive 14-1 dual-meet
record, a record that spans over a
solid year-and one-half.

The Panthers, led by All-Ameri-
can candidates Orlando Catinchi
(breaststroke), Dave Civic (free-
style), Neal Wallace (backstroke)
and Jerry DeMuro (freestyle), are
confident after a strong Christmas
workout session in Puerto Rico and
hope to display some very good
swimming times against Bucknell.

Sherwin has his chance for
revenge when the two teams clash

again February 5.

“That'll be the climax of the year
for me--to get them." he said.

While the schedule is tougher
than in past seasons. Sherwin says
he definitely would welcome a
stronger schedule.

“I think we need better

he said. adding that Pitt could stack
