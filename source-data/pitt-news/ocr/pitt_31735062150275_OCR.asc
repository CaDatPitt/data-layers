Panthers Invade South
For Finale With Dukes

Fray Saturday
Ends Careers

Of 15 Pitt Men

With Panther grid stock mount-
ing weekly, a much—to-be-feared
Pitt eleven entrains tomorrow for
a Dixieland invasion to battle the
Duke university pigskin warriors at
Durham, N. C., Saturday after-
noon. ‘

Although rated as Wallace Wade’s
greatest eleven since his 1930 pow-
erhouse at Alabama, the Blue Devils
have dropped two contests—one to
unbeaten Tennessee and an upset
loss to North Carolina. They’ve
scored one-sided victories over VMI,
Colgate, Wake Forest, Georgia Tech‘,
Davidson, and North Carolina
State.

Comparative Records

According to comparative records
the game must be rated a tossup by
the bookies. The list of squads de-

_ , _ feated by Dukes doesn’t contain any

teams that are among the nation’s
outstanding grid powers. As was
the case last Saturday, coach Char-
ley Bowser’s boys go into the strug-
gle with a much tougher array of

The football team will get a
pep’ send-off from the student’
body and the band at 12 o’clock
at the Baltimore and Ohio rail-
road station, corner of Smithfield
and Water streets, downtown.

short. addresses by Coach Charles
Bowser and Captain Konetsky,
the team will leave for Durham

day by the miraculous booting of
Eric Tipton. Late’ in the fourth
quarter, one of John Chickerneo’s
punts was blocked and the Dixie
outﬁt won, 7-0. None of the great
Panther backs could break loose on
the slippery blanket.

Another McAfee

Last year a mighty Duke squad
came north as odds-on favorite to
trip the local squad, but fumbled
away a 14-13 battle to an alert Pitt
team on a warm Indian summer aft-
ernoon. This blemish was the lone
contest to mar the record of
Gorgeous George McAfee and his
teammates, who ranked ﬁfth in
the nation.

This year, Wes McAfee, the
youngest of the Famous Ironton,
Ohio, family will be on the recep-
tion committee as the most brilliant
ball-carrier. Overshadowed last
season by his illustrious brother,
Wes is aching to square accounts
for Duke and the family. I

For 15 Pitt men, it will be their
last engagement in Blue and Gold
grid toggery. Naturally, everyone
of these wants to dull the Blue
Devil’s horns and terminate the
season successfully.

member of the starting lineup from
the 1938 affair, leads his team for

Rodgers Wins
Peace Contest

At Town Meet

Hobie Ranks Second

In Finals on Campus

With a fantasy conversation be-
tween himself and_ hosts of college
students all over America, whom
he called “legion,” Sam Rodgers,
C41, won the right to represent the
University at the state peace ora-
torical contest
next April, when
he delivered his
oration, “Legion
and l” at Pitt
HTown Meeting

Monday.

C41, ﬁnished as
r u n n e r u p i n
the contest, and
as a result was
chosen‘ as alter-
nate to the state
contest. . Also
participating in
the eliminations were Harold Kuns-

 

Rodgers

man, C42, and Hula Tully, C41.

In his speech, Rodgers depicted
“legion” as those hordes of college
students, who, uttering only stereo-
typed objections “had the stench of
the last war in their nostrils, and
were hearing the drum rolls of
the next war in their ears.”

War Is to Be Desired

Rodgers declared, in a series of
arguments shuttled back and forth
between “legion” and himself, that
even war is more to be desired than

. the consequences of a Nazi victory.

He argued, “What we are fighting
for is a vision of a society in which
there should exist neither tyrant
nor slave, a society which should
afﬁrin the worth of the individual
man, affirm man’s essential decen-
cy, dignity, and kindness.”

When “legion” countered with
what Rogers called the “usual. ster-
eotyped response” of “what good
are these progressive d”evélo”p“rhents

‘to me if I am killed in protecting

them?” the first place winner point-
ed out several points in negation of
this issue.
Death Is Inevitable

Declaring that death was inevit-
able, and that the choice was but of
a relatively few years at best,
Rodgers said, “We all know that
death is the common end of each
of us. .The ultimate power that we
have in determining our fate is the
time, to a negligible extent, and the
method. A heroic death, I believe,
is far sooner to be chosen than the
life of a subjugate.”

Rodgers concluded his speech
with an impassioned plea for man-
kind to “ﬁght anew for the fulfill-
ment of his dream for the fulled
life.” He told his listeners that “to
cast aside thot dream in considera-
tion of personal motives, even as
strong as life itself, is to push man
back along the road to barbarism.
Our loyalty to the whole of human-
ity must transcend national, racial,
religious, and class boundaries.”

During the demonstration on the..-

In the University district a few

‘School Spirit’ Takes

FINAL CHAPTER in the week-long, “Beat
Hell Out of State” campaign was written Mon-
day morning when some Dents and Engineers
sauntered down from the Hill, stalked through
the Commons Room, inveigled gullible under-
classmen into the fray, and swaggered through
the Cathedral l.ower ﬂoors wrenching class-
goers from their seats for the 1940 edition of
mass class-cutting.

This, the door pounders and Window openers
shouted, was school spirit. Show the team that
you’re behind them. Let’s go. No school today.

The freshmen liked it.

Many of the pepsters were in good form Mon-
day, for many had performed in similar vocal
capacity the preceeding Friday morning from
the Memorial Hall balcony.

big brother
jinn gives pitt
the once-over

 

‘ L15 uL'L1ACt’In was in town over the weekend. He
came out to give Pitt the once—ove1' and to check up on
me. Jim’s ten yearsiold, and he’s been promised a trip
to Pittsburgh ever since my freshman daze. That’s
over three, going on four, years now.

Jim came in by train Friday night. He had three
comic books and three dollars. He had a suitcase and a
return ticket. A big round button——which had been
forwarded for the occasion—said ‘Beat He—— Out of
State’ on Jim's left lapel. - V V '

Those comic books were for the trip out, Jim said.
He held off reading them until he got pretty well on the
way. He says that a comic book lasts him‘ on the aver-
age of one hour, so anybody can see that on a ﬁve-hoiur
trip three comic books would be a problem. Jim made
it, though. He prefers comic books to thrillers like I
used to read——Tom Swift, etc.—because comic books are
more exciting. He did get halfway through a book once,
but he couldn’t ﬁnish it.

That button caused a very private discussion.‘ Some-
body told Jim it meant “Beat Heat outa State.” I ex-
plained it meant “Beat Heck outa State.”
Hell!” Jim thinks I’m cracked.

Jim said “Aw,

jim sees state

Jim liked the Stadium: he didn’t trlillzx lb was much

' of a hill up to it, but he admitted that those steps up the

one side would have pooed Mother out.

He sat with me in the cheering block, and he sure
got a kick out those capes. .Jim’s yelling was terriﬁc.
And I got a break because now and then he’d explain a
His asides about how he made
a simil.ar run last week, or used the same play in a
vicious game against the seventh graders the other day,
added a bit, too. When here was a yell he knew, he
screeched; when it was one he didn’t know, his mouth
opened anyway—I don’t know what came out.

Jim thought the Cathedral was a lot of school, all
right, but he couldn’t get over the idea that I didn’t have
a home room. “Do you pass on bells?” he asked.

Once I mentioned something about the Cathedral
swaying about a foot at the top, and a couple hours
afterward Jim nudged me, “Yep, Bill, you’re right. Take
a look at it now. -It sort of bends——-I can see it!”

And, incidentally, Jim liked those nudes on my wall.

He said the one was pretty nice. Don’t say I didn’t tell
you.

Someone was having some fun
at my experience. I didibnot author
the letter scoring the Dents and En-
gineers at last Friday's Pep Assem-
bly.

Furthermore, I did not attend
said meeting.

The Engineers are good,
boys. I know one.

‘F or Rally

Editor, the Pitt News:

On November 30, the team will
play Duke university at Durham,
North Carolina. So———let’s have a
real pep rally before they go to

V;j~Duke and show them the true spirit

that will follow them from here.
Lets do even more. Why not go
with them to the station?

‘Let's get together and give them
a royal spirited, Pitt send-off to
Durham.

Virgil C. Holsinger, J r., BA42.

Constructive
Suggestion
Editor, the Pitt News:

. . Fundamentally who was to
be blamed for the disruption? (Last
Friday’s pep rally) .

Firstly, why doesn’t the school
have, a newer loud speaking sys-
tem? If you remember, most of
the cries were, “Louder. We can’t
héar you.” .

Secondly, when there is to be a

serious note to any rally, is it not a
better policy to have the serious
note before that note of pleasure-—
instead of rousing students &u.1uLlL)nS
by teaching them a cheer ﬁrst? . . .

Gertrude Lea Perr, C43.

Divides the Blame

Editor, the Pitt News:

. . . if I remember correctly, the
cheerleaders played their part also.
Before the crowd had got properly
seated, they split them wide apart
by calling for divided yells between
Fraternities and Independents, and
Engineers and Dents . . .

The “political convention” par-
ade staged by the Fraternities was
quite in place for a “Ziskind” po-
litical rally, but it certainly didn’t
help quiet things down .

I. . . was . . .behindarowof
College and BusAd students who
made as much noise as any similar
number of Dents or Engineers . . .

Glenn Grubb, E41.

Engineers

Retaliate
Editor, the Pitt News:

If that long obituary of names on
the third letter wants to go to a
pep meeting to listen to long winded
orations about our so-called ama-
teur team by stooges who don’t
know peas from beans about foot-
ball, they are welcomed to it. But
as far as we engineers are con-
cerned they can introduce the foot-
ball players the ﬁrst thing and then
let them express their opinions, be-
cause after all they do the work.
If the College stoo-dents were not
so afraid of losing their chairman-
ships and presidencies, perhaps
there would be a little more school
spirit and less ballyhoo for their
side.

J. Litzeinger, E42.
J. Arnold, E42.

Doesn’t Like

‘Joe College’s’ Spirit
Editor, the Pitt News:

I believe that the editors of the
Pitt News were very fair in their

opinions of the lamented pep
rally . . .

Could it be possible that the
chairman’s trying to cram a full
hour’s program into a half hour’s
time had anything to do with it? . . .

. . . M. Wendell Dietz, a typical
Joe College, threw one slur that was
wide of its mark. The Engineers
have got to have brains to go
through their curriculum .
Furthermore, the engineers do not
have time to loll in Tuck shops, or
slurp cokes . .

Their actions and epithets may
have been repulsive to the sensi-
tive smoothies and Glamour Panties,
but the Engineers are a tough
bunch. You can moan about the
Dents, M. Dietz, but don’t go mak-
ing cracks about the Engineering
men .

Pitt’s SPIRIT needs an injection
of the more spontaneous Dent-En-
gineer serum . . . We’ve got a good
team, but what backers. Phooey.

Paul Glantz, C43.

Dents Have a Word

Editors, the Pitt News:

What manner of blood ﬂows in
the veins and brains(?) of the Col-
lege Pseudo-Sophisticates? .

Especially notable were the
“quick—thinking” leaders of the pep
rally who clung so tenaciously to a
prescribed program .

The avalanche of enthusiasm . . .
could have been turned to . . . an
overwhelmingly successful demon-
stration .

-‘Are phlegmatic book-worms rep-
resentative of the wholesome spon-
taneous spirit’? . . .

John R. Jamison,

Adam J. Hauman, Dents.

Punks Smash
AE&M E Search

In Semi-Finals

A gallant AE&ME team put up a
valiant but vain struggle against a
too strong Punk seven as the Punks
defeated them 27-7 last Monday
afternoon.

The game wasn’t two minutes old
when the Punks started rolling down
the ﬁeld with steamroller precision,
never to be stopped. Lefty Ziol-
kowski was on the throwing end of
the Punks’ passing attack during
the -entire afternoon, as time after
time he found his mark.

The PunkS s<:orec.l twice in the
first period as “Zilk” passed to Lar-
ry Paffrath for the ﬁrst score of the
game and added the conversion on a
pass to Sam Milanovich. A few
minutes later l\/lilanovich caught
“Zilk’s” next touchdown heave and
made the score 13-0 as the half
closed.

As the second half began, the
losers made the game closer and
threw a scare into the Punks as
Dave Mamaux found the range with
a pass to “Mad Marshal” Winkler.
The conversion came the same way
and the Punks were only six points
ahead. ~ .

From this point, however, the
Punks had their own way and they
scored at will. The Ziolkowski to
Paffrath combine worked again as
the Punks sought to sew up the
game. The conversion went from
Lefty to l\/lilanovich. Mel Port took
Lefty’s last touchdown heave and
Clair Malarkey grabbed the con-
version pass as the game ended.

For Winter Intramural Sports Card

With the fervent hope that last
year’s typical old fashion winter
will not occur again, Director James
Potts has announced that entries
for the winter program of intra-
mural athletics will be due Decem-
ber 6.

Last year’s intramural season had
a rather bumpy road because of
Pittsburgh’s vicious and prolonged
winter. At times last year it was
practically an impossibility to ven-
ture up to Pitt’s heatless stadium,
trek up the long Trees hill to the
gym, or hop a street car to the
bowling alleys for the intramural
sports. Even with all of these
hindrances a championship cup was
still foremost in the minds of the
majority of the players; conse-
quently, the winter season did not
suffer to any great extent.

Only Four Sports

In order to ease the burden of
athletic sports in the winter, a com-
mittee of I-F members met and
ruled that handball would not be
played this year. As a result, there

Jerks Take Title

The independent league showed
more divided strength than ever be-
fore as the Jerks won the title after
several close scraps with rival
teams. The Jerks showed a galaxy
of freshman football stars with Bob
Malloy, Walt West, Larry Klotz, and
Vince Anania playing outstanding
ball. iCaptain Ernie Bonelli, the
only upp-erclassrnan on the squad,
was a decided asset with his snappy

All sports will be run ‘this year
on the round robin basis with every
fraternity team playing a minimum

of 12 games, independent and en-'

number of teams entering the
league.
Ping pong and bowling will have
the usual four men to a team, with

volleyball seven. Independent
teams which wish to enter any of
the sports may do so by taking their
entries to Mr. Potts at the Trees
Gym oﬁice.

Fresh Defeat
Se-inior Team
In W olleyhall

Now entering its second week, the
WAA volleyball tournament is pro-
gressing rapidly, with the freshmen
taking the lead by defeating the
senior class team, 34-28.

Favored to win, the seniors ran
into unlooked-for competition in
the game with the freshmen. The
freshmen put up a ﬁne ﬁght, and
barring unforseen difficulties, will
stand a good chance to take the
championship.

Today, the sophomore and junior
class teams will play their first
game of the tournament at 3:30
o’clock in the gym. All women who
have signed up, and all others who
wish to take part should be there.

This being a double elimination
tournament, the losing teams will
have a second chance to place in
the contest. The losing senior team
will play the loser of this after-
noon’s game, the winner remaining
in the tournament.

Any organization on campus wish-
ing to form a team and participate
in the tournament should see either
Mary Hilda Fagan, Ed41, chairman
of volleyball, or Irma Hotz, Ed41,
chairman of intramural sports.
