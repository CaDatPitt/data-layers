Astronomy prof discovers quasar

Frances Sansig
For The Pitt News

Cyril Hazard, R.K. Mellon pro-
fessor of physics and astronomy at the
University of Pittsburgh, has
discovered the most distant object
ever found in the universe.

That object is a quasar, or quasi-
stellar object, which Hazard said is
crucial in studying the history of the
universe.

”We’re getting to the time when
quasars and galaxies were first being
born,” he said. ”QSOs are very im-
portant in studying the origins and
evolution of the universe."

A quasar, sometimes mistaken for
a black hole, is an ultra-bright

nucleus of a galaxy, about 1,000
times brighter than 100 million stars.
Quasars are rapidly moving away
from us toward the boundaries of the
universe. They can be easily mistaken
for stars, so scientists must use spec-
troscopes to distinguish them as
quasars.

The distance of a QSO is measured
by the frequencies of light by a spec-
troscope. If the wavelengths show up
as red on the monitor, it means the
quasar is going away from the, earth.
If the light shows up as blue, it is
coming toward the earth. ‘

”The higher the redshift, the further
away the quasar is, and the further

_back in time it is. When we study a,

quasar, we're seeing the universe as
it was when it was younger/‘Hazard
said.

He said a redshift of three would
reveal the conditions of the universe
when it was one quarter of its present
size. .

In 1973 Hazard sent data to some
observatories and reported a redshift
of 3.5. ”Nothing more was found at
that redshift for about ten years,” said
Hazard. ’’People found it difficult to
get past that 3.5, and believed there
must have been a cut—off at some
point. V

”In the past few years, the world
has started to search for QSOs in
large numbers using radio methods,

and in the last year, concentration
was placed on reaching 3.5,” con-
tinued Hazard. ”Now, several ob-
jects have been found and there is a
new discovery of a record redshift of
3.8.”

Hazard discovered the quasar with

the redshift of 3.8. He stated in a '

report that he believes it will soon be
possible to find quasars with redshifts
greater than four.

”Right now, we're more than 90
percent of the way back to the begin-
ning of the universe,” said Hazard.
”The 3.8 is the highest redshift ever
found. The light we're seeing in this
object is as it was set off more than
10,000 "million years ago."

Hands Across America

A nation united

Ava Smetanka
For The Pitt News

This past weekend, Pittsburghers lined the streets along with 6 million
Americans to form a human chain from New York to Long Beach, Calif.

Two hundred-ninety miles of this chain came through Penns _
half of it in Pittsburgh and its outskirts. Along the Sixth Street Bridge, the
line was three and four rows deep, and beneath this human chain was a chain
of boats across the Allegheny River. Even though this area was so compacted
with people, there were areas in Pennsy

chester, Ligonier and Bedford.

”The idea of caring and helping one another is there, even if the people-
to fill the lines aren’t,” said participant

line at Sewickley,

In many parts of the city, there were different activities going on before
the actual act of holding hands took place. Organization was maintained ,
by a coordinator at every mile and one-tenth of a mile, so that by 3 p.m.

Minnesota considers Benjamin

David Zafris

News Editor

Pitt Provost Roger Benjamin is
reported to be one of four candidates
being considered for the number two
position at the University of
Minnesota.

Benjamin, Pitt's provost since
1983, is upfor the position of vice
president of academic affairs, accor-
ding to an article in the Minnesota
Daily, a student newspaper. The vice
president would develop and imple-
ment specific policies dealing with
faculty, particularly addressing the
question of tenure.

However, an aide at Benjamin's of-
fice has denied the report, according
to an anonymous statement released
Tuesday. ”He’s not a candidate for

provost at the University of Min-
nesota,” the statement read.

Benjamin could not be reached for
comment. An aide said he is in
Prague, ‘Czechoslovakia, and is
scheduled to return to Pitt June 2.

The report about Benjamin comes
just one week after another Pitt ad-
ministration official, Vice President
Jack Freeman, was named as
chancellor of the University of Maine
system. .

The position at Minnesota became
open when former university presi-
dent C. Peter Magrath resigned last
year and Vice President Ken Keller
took over as president.

The acting vice president, V. Ran-
na‘ Murphy, has a reported salary of
almost $100,000. University sources
there said this figure may be the same

-for the new vice president.

The othercandidates are William
Prokasy, dean of the College of Arts
and Sciences at the University of II-
linois, Robert Berdehl, the CAS clean
at the University of Oregon, and
Maiden Nesheim, head of the nutri-
tional sciences division at Cornell
University since 1974.

The University of Minnesota cur-
rently sponsors a research project in
which Benjamin is involved. Ben-
jamin is codirector with Harlan
Cleveland of the Pacific Basin Project
supported by the Humphrey Institute
at Minnesota. Pitt also sponsors the
project.

I A political scientist, Benjamin has
written widely on the subjects of
comparative political economy,
public policy and the politics of the
postindustrial societies —- Britain,
Japan and the United States.

CGS Dean John Bolvin
announced in a memo to coun-
cil members that Cheryl Zentz
will be the new director of The
Pitt Informal Program. She has ex-
perience with a similar program
at Rutgers, where a colleague
referred to her as ”very per-
sonable and professional.”

Zentz is assuming a position
that was left vacant in March
when the former director, Janet
Markel,'resigned. In her resigna-
tion, she cited ”divergent
philosophies” and communica-
tion problems between her staff
and the CGS review committee as

her reasons for leaving.

PIP names director

”Those problems have been
worked out and the committee is
functioning very well with the PIP
staff," Bolvin said.

Assistant Dean Anne Levenson
has been acting as interim direc-
tor of the program since Markel
left. She could not be reached for
comment about the new appoint-
ment on Friday.

The informal program, accor-
ding to Dean Bolvin, had taken a
more educational focus since
Markel left.

”We've eliminated a good
many of the ‘how-to’ courses in
favor of some that represent the
goals of the university better,"
Bolvin said. ”The faculty review
board that Markel resented is in
place and working very well with
the PIP staff.’.’ '

East Germans add border patrols

WEST BERLIN — Yesterday, East
German border guards turned back
West German diplomatstrying to
cross into West Berlin. The guards
also advised diplomats from other
NATO countries that measures
would be enforced to strengthen East
Germany's control on its side of the

‘divided city. Diplomats from the

United States and other NATO coun-
tries denounced the move, calling it

h an attempt to create ”an international

frontier” between East and West
Berlin. Under a postwar agreement,
the United States, Great Britain,
France and the Soviet Union have

nominal control over all of Berlin.
The three NATO allies do not
recognize its division. Foreign
diplomats were stopped at Check-
point Charlie, the main crossing point
between East and West Berlin, by
East German border guards demand-
ing to see passports. Normally,
diplomats wishing to cross the border
need only to show their red passes
allowing them to cross. East Germany
claimed the move was necessary
because of ”current circumstances”
— an act at tightening vigilance at en-
try points to West Berlin in the wake
of the April 5 bombing of the LaBel|e

Discotheque in which American ser-
viceman Kenneth Terrance Ford was
killed. The bombing triggered an
American raid on alleged terrorist
centers in Libya.

JERUSALEM — Attorney General
Yitzhak Zamir of lsreal asked the
police to examine evidence sug-
gesting that the head of the domestic
intelligence organization, Abraham
Shalom, covered up his agency's in-
vovlement in the beating deaths of
two Palestinian bus hijackers two
years ago. According to Israeli press
reports, the request for an investiga-
tion was made two weeks ago. But
the request was not acted upon until
Tuesday when pressure increased
from cabinet ministers, led by Prime
Minister Shimon Peres, to block
Zamir’s moves and prevent a police
inquiry. Oponents of the inquiry
claim it would be harmful to Israeli
security and efforts to combat ter-
rorism. The proposed investigation
would determine whether an order
was given to kill the hijackers. A

Lake resort relieves tension

David Zuchowski
Staff Writer

This year, with the fear of
overseas travel looming above,
domestic vacationing is expected
to take a big jump in the travel
market. Low gas prices should be
a further inducement to vacation
in America, a trend that should
help balance our trade deficit to
some extent.

The area within a few hours
drive from Pittsburgh is also one
with an abundance of things to
see and do, Lake Chatauqua in
Southwestern New York, right
across the state line. Recreational
offerings include a multitude of
golf courses, tennis courts, biking
trails, windsurfing, hiking and
swimming. Excellent fishing is
available on Lake Erie, only 8
miles from Chatauqua. If bass,
pike and muskie are your game,
try sparklingly clean, 20-mile-long
Lake Chatauqua.

For those less athletically mind-
ed there are five wineries in the
area offering both tours and
tasting. Between winestops there
are numerous, well-stocked an-
tique shops among the rolling
hills. But the real gem of the area
is the famous Chatauqua Institute
on the northwest shore of the
lake, home of a rich’ cultural sum-

mer repertoire that includes
everything from classical music to
jazz, rock, dance, opera, ballet
and theater.

The institute was founded in the
late 1800s. Its cultural and scenic
riches soon drew the wealthy and
famous from the Midwest and the
East Coast. People like Henry
Ford, Harvey Firestone, Thomas
Edison and William Jennings
Bryant, have spoken or vacationed
at Chatauqua.

Mayville is an ideal place to
stay when visiting the area. Not
only does it boast a horde of
recreational activities, it also
houses the Chatauqua Historical
Society. It is only three miles from
the institute and 8 miles from
Lake Erie. Close to the wineries
and to Interstate 90 (Pittsburgh’s

“main link to Rt. 79). Mayville is
' also the home of Webb’s Year

Round Resort. Starting off with a
small roadside fast food stand, the
Webbs built an empire that in-
cludes a first—class motel, candy
factory, bowling al|ey,‘gift shop,
fine restaurant and a full service
marina. Guests at Webb's Motel
can take a boat trip to and from
the institute any night of a
performance.

The institute is really a 756—acre
complex that resembles an old
turn-of-the—century Victorian com-
munity. Stately, colorful, well
maintained homes line the
meandering, tree-shaded cob-
blestone streets, gaslit by night to
produce a nostalgic glimpse of
19th century America. The ar-
chitecture at the institute is worth
a leisurely walk. Be sure to in-
clude the crowning gem, the old
Athenaeum Hotel, said to have
been the first hotel in the world to
have electricity, largely through
the efforts of one of its guests,
Thomas Alva Edison.

The institute houses America's
first book club, the Chatauqua
Literary and Scientific Circle,
began in 1878. Tying in with the
institute’s intellectual tradition are
the daily 10:45 lectures. This
year's speakers included: Gloria
Steinem; Wang Li, deputy am-
bassador to the U.S. from China;
Mel Gussow, Times drama critic;
Shirley Chisholm; Elliot Richard-
son and John Kenneth Galbraith.
There are also daily lectures at 2
p.m. in the Hall of Philosophy.

‘ The century old 6,000-seat am-
phitheater will host pop and rock
stars this year, including: Dinah
Shore, Fabian, Frankie Avalon,
Bobby Rydell, Glen Campbell,
Neil Sedaka, Spyro Gyra, Peter,
Paul and Mary,.Pete Seeger, Miles
Davis, Roy Clark, and Dave
Brubeck. Classical music lovers
can hear the Chatauqua Sym-
phony perform in the am-
phitheater with such guest artists
as: Cleo Laine and John
Dankworth, Emanuel Ax, Andre-
Michel Schub, Joseph Silverstein,
and our own Mendelssohn Choir
of Pittsburgh. Theater lovers can
enjoy performances of Moliere’s
Love is the Best Medicine, three
plays by Thornton Wilder and
many others. Opera buffs can
choose from II Trivatore, The
Daughter of the Regiment, The
Mikado or the Rake’s Progress at
the beautiful art deco opera
palace. To obtain a free and com-

Donations

Remember hearing about the first heart
transplant? It was rather exciting. So was the
first moonwalk, a woman and a black in a
presidential campaign and Calvin Klein adver-
tising. All of these events caused an uproar,
at first. Then, being mere humans, we have
become conditioned to expect such
things.We were no longer shocked by Brooke
wearing nothing between herself and her
Calvins.

The same it-happens-every-day attitude has
become a part of a miraculous medical
achievement. Organ transplants are perform-
edquite frequently. People who would other-
wise die are given a chance to live through
the use of some one e|se’s healthy organ.

There is a sad note to this story. A nation-
wide, computerized procurement network has
been established to help speed the process of
getting the donor organs to the people who
need them. This system is not widely publiciz-
ed to allow operation at its full potential. This
problem is secondary, however. Out of
20,000 potential doners each year, only 3,500
people actually donate. What good is a useful
organ in a grave? This may be a morbid
thought to some, but think of the chance given
to the person on the other end of the
transaction.

Help give another a second chance. Perhaps
you, a friend; or a family member may need
an organ transplant some day. Would you not
want him or her to have a second chance?

Administrative
integrity

A good way to assess the integrity
of the senior administrators of a
university is to examine how they
deal with the promotion and tenure
of faculty. In making this assessment
of administrators at the University of
Pittsburgh, it is useful to know and
understand the principles and
guidelines articulated in the faculty
handbook which relate to the broad
issues of tenure, promotion and
academic freedom. As a case in
point, consider what has been going
on in the schools of the health
professions.

Based on a review of the-minutes
of a meeting of the executive com-
mittee and the faculty of the school
of medicine, it appears that over the
past three years while Dr. Thomas
Detre has been vice president of the
schools of the health professions,
dozens of assistant professors who

were recruited and hired with the
prospect of tenure have been shunted
out of the tenure stream into an
academic limbo; the percentage of
faculty members sidetracked by
Detre may exceed 50 percent.

For the sake of comparison, con-
sider that in the faculty of arts and
sciences fewer than 5 percent of its
assistant professors have been moved
out of the tenure stream. The enor-
mous discrepancy between the
tenure and promotion practices in the
faculty of arts and sciences and the
schools of health professions begs an
explanation from senior ad-
ministrators, especially President
Posvar who apparently endorses
Detre’s decisions and philosophies.

The reader should bear in mind
that the faculty handbook of the
University of Pittsburgh specifies that
only under exceptional cir-
cumstances should a faculty member
be moved out of the tenure stream.
Unless Detre and Posvar believe that
50 percent denotes exceptionality,
we can only conclude that something

Letters to the Editor--—--——'—

is awry in the schools of the health
professions.

Finally, on this issue of tenure and
promotion, reflect for a moment on
what "impact the forced mass migra-
tion of more than half of the assistant
professors out of the tenure stream
would have on the political life of
your department and school. One
who is on a short-term contract, sub-
ject to periodic renewal by the vice

president, is unlikely to participate in ,

discussions that might conflict with
ideas, policies and positions em-
braced by the administration. And,
bear in mind, if Posvar condones this
atrocious practice in the school of
medicine, it could also happen to
you, whether you’re in the school of
education, pharmacy or faculty of arts
and sciences.

Thoughtful, secure, tenured facul-
ty members should be the shepherds
of the vulnerable, non-tenured junior
faculty; we have a responsibility to
ensure that the administrators of this
university play by the rules.

A Memorial Day breather

I had a few ideas for my Memorial
Day column; most I scrapped as they
fit into my usual indignant vet theme,
which I didn't feel like doing this
year. Few are interested in reading
about something that they were lucky
enough to avoid. I scrapped several
more ideas, and almost resigned
myself to skipping a week. Then
when I least expected it, I walked in-
to my story. Instead of writing about
the sacrifices of a few million of our
citizens, I'll tell you about the pro-
duct of their efforts: America.

I rediscovered America at a
Deadhead party last Sunday. One of
my brothers invited me to attend, so
we strolled down into the heart of
south Oakland after the rhumba line
across America broke up in the after-
noon. Entering our host's pleasant lit-

tle apartment, I was received warm-.

ly. A really nice couple of Deadheads
lived there. The guy was a dead
ringer for lerry Garcia, his wife at
home in a comfortable cotton dress.
The other two guests resembled no
one else there; one had a mohawk
hairdo with hieroglyphics shaved on
the sides of his head, the other ran
around in a tie-dyed monk’s robe.'A
few other interesting people joined
us throughout the next ten hours or
so as we proceededto empty the

building of all the beer we could find.
Imagine an apartment full of folks just
standing around talking and dancing,
cats joining us when they felt like it.
The conversation never stopped. The
more the cosmic people in the room
were chatting on love and peace, the
more a young man with too many
hormones treated us with some punk
lyrics, and to these l’d retort with lit-
tle known 1940s lyrics. Everyone
there had a good time; slowly getting
senile from the beer, a series of
Grateful Dead bootlegs provided the
background.

It was so nice for once to be among
sane, normal, human beings. No one
talking about mutual funds, VCRs,
their analysts or their computers be-
ing stolen. There was nobody ex-
pounding on Reagonomics, Libyan
airstrikes, or any acts of masochism
that could be lumped under the title
”sport." lust laid-back conversation
dealing with the new species of
roaches that are taking over Oakland
(this new type has wings and antlers),
or how nihilism can be an audience
participation event. The women were
all attractive, but they were real,
warm, genuine people. They were
not sorority girls clad in purple sweat
suits to cover their cellulite, schem-
ing to marry some unsuspecting kid.

These people were not out to gain
anything. They just wanted to be
friendly and enjoy some fresh
company.

That's when it hit me: this is what
America is all about, this is what
Peter Fonda searched for in Easy
Rider before the good old boys got
him. No where else in the world can
a clown like me party and exchange
intelligent conversation with such a
wide spectrum ofrpeople. The guy
with the mohawk was harmless; he
was just presenting a wild ap-
pearance to ﬂip people out. He was
not one of those radical skinheads
who hang out on street corners with
saftey pins in their foreheads and
chant one syllable slogans. He was
as American as the fellow in the
cosmic monk’s outfit, as American as
the girl dancing with the cat. We
were not required to all wear match-
ing L.L. Bean shirts, jams, Mao coats
or funny color-coded dots on our
foreheads. All we had to do was relax
and enjoy each other's company. We
had no fears of Russian or Syrian
paratroopers falling on us, although
we watched the volume so Pitts-
burgh’s finest wouldn't have to join
our festivities. Yes, America is the
best place in the world to live. Hap-
py Memorial Day.

Not in Kansas Anymorel Kevin Bold‘
1986: A bad year for technology

So far it's been a good year for the
neo-Luddites. The United States has
lost two rockets, several satellites,
one space shuttle, and seven
astronauts. The Soviet Union has ex-
perienced the worst nuclear power
accident in history, reminding us that
”highly unlikely” and ”impossible"
are not synonymous. Technophobes
everywhere are smiling and saying
they told us so.

As a technology fan, I admit that
they appear to be right. They did tell
us so. But, I remember that ap-

pearances depend on where one
stands.

We often forget life has its risks.
This includes the simplest acts and
the most familiar places. We fool
ourselves with the notion that
something is safe just because it has
been around as long as we can
remember. On the day the
Challenger exploded I heard some-
one say, ”They’d never get me up in
one of those!” He probably drove
home that night without considering
that over 50,000 people die each
year in auto accidents. Few stop to

think that waste from coal-fired
power plants is more dangerous,
more abundant and more permanent
than the amount of waste we'd have
if all our power plants were nuclear.
And most of us don't like to admit
that we are more likely to contract
cancer from something we enjoy
eating or smoking than from anything
in the environment.

The Challenger tragedy did not
”prove” that space travel is a waste
of time and money. It proved that it's
dangerous to launch a space shuttle

booster design under certain condi-
tions. In a simliar way the Chernobyl
accident demonstrated the
foolishness of using graphite to trap
radiation and the need to place reac-
tors within containment buildings.
As I type this column on my word
processor, with ”space music" play-
ing in the next room on my stereo,
I cannot help concluding that
technology's benefits — especially
the_freedom and pleasure it brings the
individual —— far outweight its risks.
I look forward to a day when nuclear
power is abandoned because of the

 

creation of a new technology (the
solar power satellite) rather than out
of fear; a day when anyone can travel
in space and perhaps choose to live
there; a day when we will have
created so much wealth that even the
poorest person will live well by our
standards.

We must not let this year's setbacks
stop us. I'm sure a few cavemen died
while trying to tame fire; we'd still be
living in caves today if their survivors
had become discouraged. The year
isn't over yet. Neither are we.

 

Feeling safe across the ocean from Chernobyl

MOSCOW —— One time in
Washington, I awoke to read in the
papers that there had been an earth-
quake the night before. Houses
shook and so did people. Dishes
spilled out of pantries and
chandeliers swung from ceilings. It
seemed everyone was frightened but
me. I slept right through it.

I get somewhat the same feeling
being in the Soviet Union in the wake
of the Chernobyl disaster. I'm told my
relatives worry about my health. I'm
asked by telephone how come I'm
not writing all the time about Cher-
nobyl. It’s a bit like the earthquake.
It's more or less happening in the
Western newspapers.

It's not that people here do not talk
about Chernobyl. Any event that is

going to bring Mikhail Gorbachev-

before the television cameras is go-
ing to set Russians talking. In one way
or another, the story dominates the
news — stories about the accident
itself, the cleanup, the bravery of the
helicopter pilots who are said to have
dropped gravel and boron oh the fire
to extinquish it and soak up neutrons.

Especially with foreigners who are
thought to have either more or bet-
ter information, the subject comes
up. We trade. In exchange for infor-
mation we get rumors: A cousin from
Kiev said that everyone is scared; a
neighbor reports that her aunt has
fled to Moscow from Kiev; things are
worse that the authorities reported;
things are better than they reported.
Only when it comes to rumors is
there a free-enterprise system here:
Youehave your choice.

But there is no panic, no great con-
cern. The people I have talked with

V do not think Moscow is —— or was —-

in any danger. In the first place, they
have far more confidence in the abili-
ty of their scientists to contain the
danger than Americans do. And they
do not share such a dark view of their

government that it would, for pro-.

paganda reasons, endanger the lives

of its citizens.

The Soviet Union, like the United
States, is a vast land. A disaster in
Kiev is, to a Moscovite, what one in
Indiana would be to a New Yorker
—— along way off. That is even more
true to a resident, say, of Tbilisi or —
eons away-—— Tashkent. But even in
Leningrad, more or less in the direc-
tion of that first nuclear wind,
residents did not think they were in
danger.

None of that means that you do not
eat a tomato without asking where it
is from. (It is too early in the season
for tomatoes to come from the
Moscow region.) We all know that

. feeling. Tomatoes join the list of

items that put you into a state of alert
——— cheap Italian wine, Tylenol tablets,
and, for some, trips abroad.

 

Still, this is Russia and you are
never sure if you know what you
think you know. Information is
always scarce and while the Soviets
have paraded experts before the
Western press, you never really learn
all you need. Questions sometimes
are not answered. Much time is spent
answering questions from cor-
respondents from so-/called
”socia|ist” countries — the Eastern
European satellites. They are in-
variably sewed up to suit some pro-
paganda purpose: Don't you think

Chernobyl proves that Star Wars is
even more dangerous? Answer: I'm
glad you asked that 

Sometimes, the very manner in
which the Soviet propaganda ap-
paratus seeks to reassure its own peo-
ple tends to add to the general
unease. Some Western correspon-
dents were allowed to visit Kiev, but
the ones interviewed for television
were ”friendlies” from communist
papers. Instead of saying that there
was little they could learn (they can
not see radiation after all), theyvpro-

nounced the entire city and its in-
habitants hunky—dory. They lam-
basted the Western press for sug-
gesting, based on a mere nuclear ac-
cident, that some people might have
suffered radiation poisoning.

So insistent were the Russians to
show that Kiev was safe, that they
made at least one group of Brazilian
and Argentinian tourists stop there.
Although some members of t_he
group begged to skip Kiev, they were
told it was impossible to change the
tour or, for that matter, call their

 

travel agent in Buenos Aires. Before
the tourists left Kiev, they were all
checked for radiation, told they had
none and given a slip of blue paper
with some Russian writing on it that
they could not read. They were told
it was a certificate of good health.
So like the tomato, I eye the news
carefully, season it with the available
rumors and digest it all. My relatives
worry, the office wonders. But, I
think, Chernobyl won't bother me.
After all, I survived. the Great
Washington Earthquake. \

Cindy Fish

For The Pitt News

Known for its spectacular spring and fall flower shows, Phipps Con-
servatory is advancing into new territory — Sculptures at Phipps.
Curators Diane George and Jerry Caplan have put together an exhibit
displaying the works of 35 contemporary sculptors whose work lends -
itself to the beautiful setting of the new summer flower show.

Artist Gregory Kavalec has chosen a traditional sculpture look for
”Forest Mask” and ”Neptune Mask.” These two masksboth repre-
sent male facial features, constructed out of what resembles a bronze
metal. For ”Neptune Mask,” Kavalec chose to sculpt the face out of
sea shells, thus following in the history of Neptune, the Roman god
of the sea. Kavalec chose to bring ”Forest Mask” to life by molding
this mask out of shapes resembling different types of foilage. Both masks
are relatively the same shape and ‘size. ‘

Marshall C/ark/The Pitt News

”F|orida Room” is a colorful sculpture by artist Marie Kelly resembl-
ing a kite. One can just imagine it soaring over the beaches of the
Florida coast, since it is a colorful work of art displaying tones of orange,
blue, yellow and many other tropical hues.

_ Jane Haskell has created a very delicate look with her sculpture ”The
Web.” Hanging from all directions of the display house — ceiling,
plants and so forth — ”The Web” is a mock spider web constructed
from small crystal beads strungon a thin clear wire. There is not a
spider in this web, but there should be since Haskell has successfully
created a masterpiece of a spider web for her contemporary sculpture.

These are just a few of the many outstanding contemporary sculptures

on display through September 15 at the new summer exhibit

' ”Sculptures at Phipps.” Open from ,9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily, Phipps Con-

_ servatory expects an estimated 60,000 visitors to come through its doors

for the first sculpture show in the history of the conservatory. All other

famed shows at Phipps have displayed the beauty of the many flowers

and plants growing at_Phipps, and even though the emphasis is on

sculpture in this show, the flowers and plants are looking as beautiful
as ever.

”Big Daddy Colboots copped the
wheels, and we're trapped in
Hipsville with only our guiter pix and
drum stix. Let's roast a pig and go to
Freakout City where all the guys and
chicklets can groove down to the big
monster Frankenbeat."

— From an upcoming novel by the
Jukebox Juror entitled Weekend
Hiatus in Hipsville 2929 B.C.

The '60s revival is in full swing; 12-
year-olds are wearing paisley, and
John Cougar is twistin’ to a twangin'

new tune. But long before stretch.

pants arrived at Pitt and the Monkees
appeared on MTV, garage bands like
the Chesterfield Kings were explor-
ing the '60s without the benefit of
social acceptance. The Bangles are
nice, but the Kings are the real thing.

This band is not a gang of cheap
second-rate revivalists as many scep-
tics would readily label them. The
Chesterfield Kings simply play music
the way it was meant to be played,
music that breathes of life, energy
and passion (sounds like the '60s to
me).

Their latest album STOP! is a con-
glomeration of '50s R&B and the
post—beatnik world of the '60s, with
songs that are as custom made as lead
guitarist Rick Cona’s Rickenbacker
guitar. The Kings, not cheap imita-
tions, draw on their influences and
recombine them in a manner that is
all their own. Lead singer Greg
Prevost instantly grabs your attention
with a cocky Jagger-like snarl, while
a vintage Harrison fuzz guitar and a
swirling pipe organ synth, are
guaranteed to get your heart throb-
bing and your bowl-cut bobbing.

The following is an interview with
lead singer Greg Prevost.

Q: How do you feel about the re-
cent success of the new album?

A: It's satisfying because there are
more people out there who are aware
of what we are doing.

LIVE FOR LIFE
Various Artists
I.R.S.

John McCombe

Entertainment Editor

This is serious business. The back
cover art for Live for Life includes a
cancer cell which has been enlarged
10,000 times. Artists such as Sting,
R.E.M. and the Alarm have donated
their royalties from the album's sales
to the AMC Cancer Research Center.
This is by no means a great album,
but any record which features an out-

Q3 Does the possibility of commer-
cial success bother you?

A: No. We would like to be
popular and reach out to a wider au-
dience of people, but unlike so many
others, we refuse to compromise
anything to do so.

Q: Where do you guys fit into this
'60s craze?

A: We've been into it a lot longer

than any of the other groups recent-
ly cashing in. Growing up I used to
collect '60s records because the
music in the '70s really got lame.
That's what was so great about punk.
It brought back the control of pop

culture to the youth where it obvious-
ly should be, just like in the '60s,
with the birth of rock 'n' roll. You'll

take from R.E.M.'s Murmer is a wor-
thy investment.

Each of the two sides of Live for Life
kicks off with a performance by a solo
Police-man. As expected, Sting's
"I've Been Down So Long"
outclasses Stewart Copeland's tepid
"Love Lessons,” even though Jeff
Beck attempts to sabotage the Sting
effort with some horrendously
overplayed guitar squawking. I only
wish that Sting could have con-
tributed the incendiary "I Burn For
You.” That track was easily the
climax of his recent American and
European performance.

find, though, that the better groups
playing '60s music today have been
around for a while and are the real
thing.

Q: Where do you draw your in-
fluences from specifically?

A: We're very interested in '50s
R&B as well as the basic '60s sounds

like the Kinks. I was also interested
in Alice Cooper.

Q: What are some of your contem'-
porary interests?

A: I like the Jesus and Mary Chain,
the Lyres and Hoodoo Gurus just to
name a few. I hate modern country
music, and I can't really appreciate
jazz.

R.E.M and others play live for life

Live for Life hits its peak with the
live version of the Alarm's anthemic
"Howling Wind” from Declaration.
This five minute fireball has a reckless
urgency that suggests why many fans
and critcs alike consider the Alarm
to be the best live band currently
cranking up a set of Marshall
amplifiers.

In case you become carried away
with the music and lose sight of the
motivation behind the disc, I.R.S. has
included a 1975 Wembly Stadium
performance by Bob Marley and the
Wailers. Marley was widely con-
sidered to be the greatest reggae per-

 

Stop! look and listen to the Chesterfield Kings

Q: You have a fun live show.

A: We like to give people a good
show and put a little effort into it
when we perform. Who wants to go
and see five guys standing still? We
also like to incorporate the audience '
by intermingling when possible, let
people in the audience sing, etc.

Q: The sound is very raw.

A: This is an element ofall our live

shows. We want them to be very

loud and powerful.
Q: New records?
A: We will have an EP out soon to

hold us over till the next album. On
the new album we really want to ex-
press ourselves completely and find
oursound.

punk. It brought back the con-
trol of pop culture to the youth
where it obviously should be,
just like in the '60s, with the
birth of rock 'n' roll."

Q: Rumor has it that you all drink
TAB.

A: Yeah. That's our favorite drink.

Q: How did you like it when they
switched to NutraSweet?

A: At first the transition was hard,
but we've adjusted and find the new
taste to be quite satisfying.

Q: Why the "Chesterfield Kings?”

A: The name was unpretentious.

Q: Feelings on torpedo bras and
Laura Petry?

A: I like my girls without.

Q: Feelings on Libya?

A: People are more into violence
and destruction than anything else —
even squareheads.

Performances such as Marley's make
Live for Life worth your attention.

This is a collection of great merit.

Bruce Kasrel
For The Pitt News

The deafening roar from the jet
engines of your F-14 Tomcat engulfs
you as the plane takes off. The
ground beneath rapidly grows
smaller and is soon replaced by the
serene white of the clouds. You are
a Navy pilot flying a mission to in-
tercept enemy aircraft. The ”bogeys”
appear on your radar and you

i prepare for a fight. They are quicker
and more maneuverable than you are
and they soon have you under their
gunsights. Cutting across the sky does
nothing to shake them -— you have
only a few more moments left. Grasp-
ing the throttle for dear life, you force
the plane into a dive and popcorn
spills all over your lap.

Oddly enough this scenario will be
a familier one to thousands of
moviegoers this summer as they ex-
perience Top Gun. Although the sub-
ject matter behind the film — the
rights of passage for a jet pilot —- is
not new to the screens — both An Of-
ficer and a Gentleman and The Right
Stuff covered this topic brilliantly —

O the fact that the film is shot using ac- -

tual F-14s makes Top Gun the most
realistic rollercoaster ride of a movie

Top Gun is the story of what ‘it

takes to be the best of the best in the _

Navy's F-14 squadrons. During the
Vietnam War, the Navy became
disturbed by our pilots poor kill ratio
of 3-to-1 (compared to 17-to—1 in
V Korea and 15-to-1 in World War II).
The Pentagon realized that our boys
were becoming dependent on their
gauges and had lost the ability to
dogfight. So they established the
Navy Fighter Weapons School (code
name Top Gun) at San Diego's Mir-
mar Air Station. Every eight weeks the
top F-14 pilots in the Navy partake

Gun instructors (previous grads of the
program).

Pete ”Maverick” Mitchell (Tom

Cruise) is one of the lucky few
selected into the program. A hotshot,
cocky flyboy, ”Mav” can outfly
anybody in the skies. His one prob-
lem is that ”he flies out of the seat
of his pants.” And at Top Gun, this
type of reckless behavior can spell
disaster.
. Cruise's scruffy and solid features
match Maverick perfectly. His sly
grin is reminiscent of Sam Shepard’s
Chuck Yeager in The Right Stuff. Like
Shepard, Cruise controls his
character’s emotions (especially de-
fiance) with confidence and
authority.

Once airborne, flying F-14s is
Maverick’s love, but as soon as he
lands, his gunsights turn towards
astrophysicist and Top Gun instruc-
tor Charotte Blackwood (Kelly
McGillis). A tall, gorgeous blonde
among sophisticated military
machinery may seem a tad contrived,
but her character was modeled after
an actual Top Gun instructor.
McGi||is’ smashing looks ‘almost
distract us from realizing what a
talented actress she is. It's hard to
believe that she was the quiet Amish
widow in Witness. Top Gun marks
the first time she is able to show both

her looks and acting ability..

However, most of her impact is lost
due to the lack of character develop-
ment in the script. .
Despite the age and height dif-
ference (she has about five years and
five inches on him), Cruise and
McGillis work well together. The
screen dazzles with passionate desire
for flying and each other. Director
Tony Scott realized the potential

chemistry between these two and -

magnified it with a sensationally
filmed love scene done in silhouette.
Not since Body Heat has a duo

looked so sensuous on film.

Though Scott deserves much merit
for his camera angles, he should
receive a good flogging for letting so
much trite dialogue slip through.
With Charlotte uttering lines like,
”When I first saw you, you were big-
ger than life,” the flame between the
two is smothered by a blanket of
sappiness.

While the corny dialogueforces
Top Gun into a near fatal nose dive,
the spectacular aerial sequences
miraculously rescue the flick and
promptly send it soaring. Producers
Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson
spent hours in conference with the
Pentagon before shootingbegan, and
came away with everything they
needed plus two Top Gun advisors
to ensure accuracy. With the excep-
tion of a few minor adjustments for

visual appeal, everything in Top Gun
is authentic Navy issue.

In order to capture the essence of
flight, six cameras were mounted to
a Learjet that trailed behind the ac-
tion. The results are nothing short of
exhilarating. Each dogfight is filmed
with such realism that you can feel
the C5. if this movie does not take
home an Oscar for cinematography,
it will be the biggest mistake since
Geraldo Rivera began reading about
Al Capone.

Even with the dialogue-related
engine problems, Top Gun is one of
the most thoroughly entertaining
films in years. The blistering speed of
the jets will have you glued to your
seat, and if you are fascinated by fly-
ing, you will never want this film to
run out of fuel and -have to touch
down.

E A few days ago, a friend came up
to me and stated, ”You know Cold,
there hasn't been a good punk band
since the Rolling Stones.” I politely

questioned if he would like to share '

some of the grass he had been smok-
ing. He continued, ”What I am try-
ing to get across to your reluctant
hardcore mind is that there has never
been a hardcore band that's been as
dangerous as the Stones. When the
Stones released songs like ”Under
My Thumb,” ”2,000 Light Years
From Home” and ”19th Nervous
Breakdown,” the rest of the bands
were dishing out bubble gum pop.
The bands you listen to all sound the

same, and my definition of punk is.

to just do something dangerous.”
Well, I feel that it is pretty

dangerous to walk out in front of a T

facist, hardcore, skin army and not
play a metal/speedcore set. So J.P.
Presley, here are a few underground
bands who I feel are ”dangerously
punk.” ‘

he calls ”hillbi|ly” music is a sincere
and accessible effort to revitalize the
lost and diluted music of ”rural,

of heavy metal, then you will truly
enjoy this one, for the sound is essen-
tially unchanged. Of course, if you
have hated Judas Priest for as long as
you can remember, then there is no
chance of you appreciating this
album, for the same general reasons.

Rob Halford sounds as mean and
nasty as ever, and the fact that he is

inarticulate is inconsequential since
the lyrics are basically mindless
anyway. Glenn Tipton and K.K.
Downing again share the lead guitar
chores well, as they masterfully
screech their guitars into overdrive.
Slashing cords with a heavydrum
backbeat permeate every groove of
this album, and some fine guitar solos
are included in ”Locked ln,””Rock

”Out in the Cold.”

Judas Priest is not for everyone and
neither is Turbo. But the fact that
these five men are fine musicians is
undeniable. Judas Priest plays straight
forward rock with energy and emo-
tion, and provide rebellion with a
touch of class.

No reason for Smith to miss U.S. trials

John Enright

Assistant Sports Editor

Charles Smith, in case you sports
fans have forgotten, is a 6-10 power

. forward on the Pitt Panther basketball

team.

Not only is Smith a basketball
player, but a very good one at that.

Two years ago Smith was named

the Big East Conference Freshman of ’

the Year. This past season Smith's
statistics improved, but he didn't.
Smith was constantly plagued with
foul trouble and he often disappeared
on the court during critical moments
of games, such as the second half of
the Panther’s home loss to Syracuse
when he scored zero points.

Despite his disappointing
sophomore year, Smith is still highly
regarded by many knowledgable
basketball observers, such as ESPN’s
Dick Vitale, who once called Smith
’’a Bo Derek in basketball shoes."

Sorry, Dick, Smith hardly
resembles the curvaceous actress, but
your point was clear. Smith has all
the tools to be a perfect ”10” on the
basketball floor. He possesses all the
qualities that are evident in superstar
players: speed, quickness, size and
strength.

Also, Smith has a feathery jump
shot 16 feet from the hoop and is an
adept passer, rebounder and
shotblocker.

These are the attributes the United
States National Basketball Team
coaching staff saw in Smith when
they invited him to their tryouts in
Colorado Springs, Colo., from May
15-19.

Smith and 46 other collegiate
hoopers were to compete for the 12
roster spots available on the squad,

’ which will play in the World Cham-

pionship Games in Madrid, Spain,
later this summer.

Eric Poole
For The Pitt News

Editor's note: this article is the first
in a two-part series.

The athlete's quest for a com-
petitive advantage is as old as
athletics itself. Some of these advan-
tages are legal and safe, like gadget
plays in football and the hidden-ball
trick in baseball. Others are not only
qtiestionahle in the eyes of the law,

Anabolic steroitis are supposed to
be available only by prescription, but
are available to almost every
weightlifter through underground
sales. On March 7 of last year, one
of America's largest suppliers,
Charles Radler, was convicted of the
possession and sale of steroids from
his home in Penn Hills. He was
slapped with a_ one- to two-year
sentence. However, Radler’s prison
term deterred very few people from
selling the illegal drug. As long as
there isa market for something, peo-
ple will sell it. Last year's baseball co-

caine trials showed that. And as long

/'

This was to be a perfect opportuni-
ty for Pitt's star to regain his con-
fidence, the confidence that made
him one of the best freshmen basket-
ball players in America two short
years ago.

But Smith never got that chance
because he didn’t go to the trials.
Believe it or not, he was unable to
make the trip to Colorado because of
a conflict with one of the summer
courses he is currently taking at the
university.

‘The Panthers had a golden oppor-
tunity to add some needed prestige
to the program and, more important-

ly, boost the confidence of Smith,
who must be a little dismayed by his
mediocre performance last season.

It's nice to know the university
pushes the academic end of the spec-
trum for its student-athletes, but let

I us all remember that CharlesSmith
is here to play basketball.

Of course, Smith himself may feel
otherwise. In his mind, he could be
here to get an education first and play
basketball second, not the other way
around; that's fine. I have no com-
plaints if Smith wasn't in Colorado
because he didn't want to miss a test.
Although, I highly doubt that this was
the case.

What bothers me is that the univer-
sity wasn't able to make ar-
rangements for him to make up the
exam, ifthat was indeed.the problem,

, at a later date. Remember, we are not

dealing with a borderline student
who is struggling to maintain his
athletic eligibilty.

From my view, granted that it is a
slanted one, Smithcould have made
it to the tryouts, which would have
been a valuable asset for him. But it
is too late to do anything about it
now. I just hope Pitt uses better
judgement if it is confronted with a
similar situation in the future.

I think it- is wonderful that the
university is concerned with the
academic progress of its star hooper.

The advantage of using steroids is '

that this drug retains nitrogen in the
muscles, allowing the body to create
amino acids, thus regenerating more
quickly. Baroudi’s case has brought
up the major disadvantage of in-
gesting steroids: death. '
There are other disatlyantages.

number of athletes, including three
American weightlifters, were dis-
qualified and sent home when they
failed post-event blood testing for
steroids. At the Los Angeles Olympics
in 1984, all medal winners were
tested for steroid usage. Incredibly,
no one failed. With the advent of
steroid testing, there have been
whispers from behind the Iron Cur-
tain about a new type of steroid that
can mask itself from the testing
devices, but there is no indication
that anyone on either side of the Iron

‘coaching staff's plans,

But that in itself is the problem. This
isn't the guy to worry about. The
average fan probably doesn't know
this, but Charles Smith is an honors
student.

Word has it that one of Smith's pro-
fessors wouldn't allow him to make
up a test he would miss during the
tryouts.

I'm sure the university could have
found a way around Smith's ”class
conflict” so that he could go to Col-
orado for five days to enhance his
already marvelous basketball skills.

Pitt did send a special petition to
the U.S. coaching staff, headed by
Lute Olson of Arizona, asking if
Smith could try out for the squad in
June, when the 18 players who sur-
vived the first cuts in May join fora
week in Tucson to trim the final roster
to 12.

Tommy Amaker of Duke and Dan-
ny Manning of Kansas also sent
similar petitions. Amaker and Man-
ning’s petitions were approved;
Smith's was rejected. The Amateur
Basketball Association of the United
States of America approved Smith's
petition, but Olson's coaching staff
rejected it. Obviously, Duke's lightn-
ing quick guard and Kansas’ silky
smooth forward figure into the U.S.
but Smith
doesn't. .

But that is not the point. The point
is that the Pitt basketball coaching
staff blewiit.

Please take note. This was the first
blunder by the new Pitt basketball
staff, headed by Coach Paul Evans.

Somewhere along the line in this
decision, the Panther coaches forgot
a very important fact: Charles Smith
is attending the university on a
basketball scholarship, not an
academic scholarship!

Don't get me wrong. I'm not ad-
vocating that Pitt should be more
concerned with athletics than
academics for its student-athletes.

Curtain has developed the ”invisible
steroid.”

It took the death of an Olympic
athlete to uncover another steroid
controversy. Augustinius ”Stijn”
Jaspers, who finished fifth in the
5,000-meter run for the Netherlands,
was found dead in his dorm room at
Clemson University on October 19,
I984. The 23-year-old laspers, who

Smith snubbed, Gore still waiting for invitation

Some holiday leftovers:

0 Pitt basketball standout Charles
Smith was snubbed when he filed a
petition asking permission to par-
ticipate in a second tryout for the U.S.
national team.

Smith had a prior commitment
with a class here at Pitt and could not
get out of it. In turn, he missed the
first tryout. Two others, Kansas’ Dan-
ny Manning and Duke's Tommy
Amaker, petitioned and were permit-
ted to participate in the second
tryout. , .

One still wonders if Smith would
even have been invited in the first
place had not Paul Evans been
named as the successor to Roy
Chipman.

If I were Demetreus Gore, I'd still
be checking the mailbox for an invita-
tion to tryout.

0 Perhaps the one thing that sur-
prised me the most in the NFL draft
was how the Pitt offensive line was
ignored. Is it a sign of the times?

In the past, Pitt offensive linemen

UConn names Calhoun new

Storrs, Conn. — Jim Calhoun, 44,
head coach at Northeastern Univer-
sity for the past 14 years, has been
named the new basketball head
coach at the Univerity of Connect-
icut, becoming the 1 7th head coach
of men's basketball at the university.

In making the announcement of
Ca|houn's appointment, Director of

Athletics John L. Toner said, "As

chairman ‘of the search committee, I
want to congratulate all members 'of
the search committee for an extreme-
ly well done job. I am happy and
proud that the choice of the search

have faired well in the NFL, whether
they were a first-round choice like
Bill Fralic or a lower-round selection
like Ron Sams.

It seemed like if you were a
member of the Pitt offensive line —
you got drafted. That is just the way
it works. That was not the case this
spring as Barry Pettyjohn, Mike
Dorundo and Tony Brown were all
passed over.

All three have signed free-agent
contracts, so it will be interesting to
see if they uphold the tradition.

0 The Steelers left two players
stranded at the airport earlier this
week. Both were draftees: return
specialist Erroll Tucker and tight end
Cap Boso.

Chuck Noll should think about do-
ing the same with some of his veteran
players. One that comes to mind is
defensive lineman Darryl Sims,
another is punter Harry Newsome.

0 After watching the Stanley Cup
finals last week, and then watching
the first game of the NBA Champion-

committee was no different than that
of the director of athletics nor of the
president of the university. .

,”l for one am looking forward to
working with Jim Calhoun to help
him carry out this very important and
difficult mission,” concluded Toner.

University of Connecticut President
Dr. John T. Casteen III said, "I am
delighted that Mr. Calhoun has ac-
cepted the position of head basket-
ball coach. He was selected from an
extraordinary group of finalists for his
demonstrated capacity to build and
to lead, and for his commitment to

ship on Memorial Day, I concluded
one thing: Something has to be done
to spice up the NBA.

I cannot stand watching game after
NBA game where there is a 20-point
or better margin of victory. I would
rather’ watch the Flames and the

Jim Urban

Canadiens brawl for 15 minutes after
a one point overtime game.

NBA games should be shortened,
zone defenses should be legal, and
the shot clock should be 35 seconds.

0 I do not envy Pitt football coach
Mike Gottfried. The Panthers face
Maryland, Purdue, West Virginia and
Notre Dame in the first six weeks of
the season — no pushovers by any
stretch of the imagination.

I can hear the Pitt fans now if the
Panthers falter early.

the fundamental concept that educa- ‘

tional excellence is the first mission
of a successful program. All of us at
the university wish him great suc-
cess."

Calhoun comes to Connecticut
after a highly successful 14-year
tenure at Northeastern where he led
the program from Division II status to

‘ a perennial NCAA Division I Tourna-

ment team, compiling an overall
record of 250-137. He is the win-
ningest coach in the school's history.

Over the past three seasons,
Calhoun has guided Northeastern to

0 Keeping on the subject of foot-
ball, remember three years ago when
Penn State's D.J. Dozier was gaining
yardage by the mile? Now he will be
a senior, and possibly not even one
of top five backs in the East.

First, put Pitt's Charles Gladman
and Temple's Paul Palmer at the top
of the list. To that add Dozier’s
backfield mate, fullback Tim Manoa,
and G|adman's soon to be backfield
mate, Craig Heyward. .

Another good Pitt runner, as long
as he is healthy, is Tom Brown. Don't
forget A.B. Brown either, now at
West Virginia.

Dozier has got to be saying, "How
soon they forget."

0 In the ”Do you recall?” category:
Do you recall Dante Wiley? He is at
Nebraska right now and, according
to the Nebraska Sports Information
Office, is doing quite fine.

Wiley had a good spring practice
session and is now a third string cor-
nerback for the Huskers. He is ex-
pected to challenge for the backup
role behind returning starter Brian

Davis.

The 6-2 sophomore came to Pitt as
the self-proclaimed starting quarter-
back for the Panthers. He eventually
played several different positions
before finally settling in a defensive
back. Unfortunately for him, his
hardest hit of that season was inﬂicted
upon a fellow student in Lothrop
Hall. ‘

0 With all the attention Lee McRae
is getting because of his world record,
it is easy to overshadow other
members of the Pitt track and field
team.

The name to watch in the years to
come is Eric Cannon —— he runs like
he was shot out of a cannon.

You heard it here first.

Pittsburgh officially retired the No. 13

The baseball field at Three Rivers
Stadium will be transformed into a
battleground on Saturday, June 21 at
8 p.m. as the Ford/Budweiser U.S.
Hot Rod Association Triple Crown of
Motorsports roars into action.

Modified trucks such as Blue Max,
Motown Missile, Oklahoman, Black

0 Cold, locals Gone A.W.O.L. and Iron

City Express, plus other top com-
petitors will battle it out for valuable
”Circuit of Champion” points and
prize money.

Unlike many motorsports, time
isn't important in pulling. Power is
the key as contestants pull a
50,000—pound weight transfer sled
down a 200-foot dirt and clay track.

A “full pull’.’is registered when the _

vehicle goes the entire length of the
track without stopping. More than
one full pull results in a ’’pull off”
with additional weight added; As
simple as it sounds, competition is
high among pullers and every inch
counts. -

Thirty motorcross drivers in the
125CC, 250CC, and ATV (all—terrain

. vechicle) classes will race for points

on the indoor track. g

A special added attraction will
feature the ’’Battle of the Monster
Trucks.” Demonstrating that he ranks
No. 1 among the monster trucks, Bob
Chandler's Big Foot will challenge
Awesome Kong in a spectacular
”crush off.”

Big Foot is a 1974 Ford F-258 and
features a 460 cubic inch V-8 engine.
This magnificent piece of machinery
stands over 10 feet tall, . weighs
13,000 pounds and is valued at
$150,000.

Tickets are $15 and $12 and goon

all ”Choice Seat” locations including
Kaufmann’s, Gimbels, Record Outlet

The Pitt ‘News, May 28,1986

A Ray of Hope:

lohnny hot, but Bucs cool off  

Bob Travers
Sports Editor

Cincinnati Reds pitcher Bill
Cuillickson was especially cautious
to this hitter. At bat was the second
leading batter in the National League.
Guillickson paused, then threw a
breaking ball. The batter, Johnny Ray
of the Pirates, promptly smacked the
pitch right back up the middle, bet-
ween shortstop and second base.

That hit during last Saturday’s game
raised his average to .352. Ray's team
lost 4-2. It's going to be that kind of
year for Johnny Ray and the Pitts-
burgh Pirates.

With the season nearly a quarter of
the way finished, it is becoming ob-
vious that Ray is the Pirates’ only real
offensive threat. Ray lacks the power
of some Bucs like Sid Bream or Mike
Brown, but no Pirate can match Ray
for consistency. It is also becoming
obvious that when the 1986 Pirate

highlight film is made, Johnny Ray
will be stealing most of the scenes.
The Pirates are in a downslide that
has taken them from third place and
respectability to fifth place and a
15-23 record.

The Pirates’ slump has not slowed
Ray, however. Great things were ex-
pected of the second baseman when
he was acquired from the Astros five
years ago in a deal that sent Phil
Gamer to Houston. Ray delivered
from the first. He won the 1982 Na-
tional League Rookie of the Year
Award and in subsequent seasons
Ray has led the team both in average
and in base hits. But he has never
been near the torrid pace he is set-
ting for himself this season.

, Ray, who is unlike most second
basemen in that he is an outstanding
fielder who can hit, proved last
winter that he is unlike most Nor-
therners as well. The vast majority of
slush-smothered inhabitants of the
Snow Belt are only too happy to
leave the steel gray skies of the North

High Contrast Color:

We use coloring techniques to texturize

for a week or two of relaxation along
the Gold Coast of Florida. That wasn't
good enough for Ray. He had to be
different. Last winter Johnny Ray
went to Florida to work. And, said
Ray, that has made all the difference.

”l think it's all a matter of the ex- ,
—tra work I did in Florida during spring

training," Ray said of his hitting in
1986. “I think that work is still car-
rying over. l still take extra swings
during batting practice now.”

It would seem to the outsider that
someone in a fight for the National
League batting championship would
be especially concerned with his
own statistics when he is at the plate.
Ray says this is just not so.

“You really can’t think about things
like average when you're batting. I
really don't think about statistics at all
when I'm up. Statistics are not as im-
portant as the team. Baseball is a
team game with 24 individuals try-
ing to win.”

Had that statement been made last

-year Ray would have reminded us

that baseball is a team sport with 25
individuals trying to win. Over the

.winter, the 26 general managers in

the game decided upon a
gentleman's agreement limiting team
rosters to the present 24 player limit.

”That definitely made an impact,”

Ray said of the new roster limitation. I

”Anybody who can play more than
one position or has the ability to
pinch—hit has a better chance of mak-
ing the team. There is more strategy
involved simply because you don't
have as many players to work with.”

The season, while no longer in its
infancy, is nevertheless a long way
from the playoffs of October, but
some fans, bless their hearts, are
already thinkin’ pennant.

”The season has a long way to go
so I don't want to make any predic-
tions, but I think the Reds will be
there,” Ray said. ”They just have too
much talent not to be in the pennant
race. lf they stay healthy, they'll be
init. The Cardinals, in our division,
will be there, too.”

The New York Mets have been do-
ing all they can this season to deprive
America of a pennant race in the Na-
tional League East, but Ray thinks that
the Mets can be caught.

”The Mets are not untouchable,”  "

Ray remarked. ”They are playing
outstanding ball right now, but l don't
know if they can keep playing this
well all season. I think if we stay in
the the top half of the division the first
part of the season we definitely have
a chance at the pennant.”-
