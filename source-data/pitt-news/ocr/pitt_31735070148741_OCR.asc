Energy drinl<s.]unkfood. No sleep. For
many students, ﬁnals week is synony-
mous with masochism. '

As Pitt students prepare for this
semester’s ﬁnals week, which begins
next Monday, ofﬁcials from Pitt’s Stu-
dent Health Services said the level of
pressure that many students feel they
face increases as students worry about
how theirﬁnalswillaffecttheir overall
GPAS. Out of concern for whatthis in-
creased stress level cando to students,
the Pit Program Council hosts Finals
Survival week every semester.

The PPC planned activities that it
hopes students will use to take their
minds of test anxiety and help them
relax. Most of the activities will take
place on campus and are open to all
students.

Senior Rachel Kasab, public rela-
tions director for PPC, said that while
there is no limit, between 30 and so
students attend most of the events.

For 75 of Pitt’s heavily involved
students on campus, adding one
more organization to their sched-
ules didn’t seem like that much
more ofa stretch.

The Outside the Classroom

. Curriculum Honorary Society

inducted its first undergradu-L’
ate students for completing the
requirements of the OCC Friday
night in the Frick Fine Arts Build-
ing. Students who have completed
the OCC requirements are eligible
to be inducted into the society,
which provides beneﬁts to its
members like exclusive meetings
with potential employers.

The OCC Student Advisory

Committee, composed of 12 stu-
dents and a supervisor, Residence
Life director and Associate Dean
of Students Shawn Brooks, cre-
ated the society to reward stu-
dents for their involvement on
campus. Each inductee received a
certiﬁcate, pin and emerald green
tie and scarf.’ .

Pitt created the OCC program
in 2008 as a way for students
to keep trackof activities they
participate in while developing
themselves in areas such as lead-
ership, service to others and ap-
preciation of the arts.

Students and administrators
worked on revamping the pro-
gram during the summer. A new
board, called the OCC-Student
Advisory Committee, wanted to
make the program more legiti-

mate and accessible to students.
One of the ideas they came up
with was the OCC Honorary So-
ciety. ‘ ‘

The OCC Honorary Society
will offer beneﬁts exclusive to its
members, such as meetings with
potential employers. Members
will also receive the green cord
at graduation, a carry—over from
the past OCC program.

Student Government Board
members James Landreneau and
Emily Hoover served on the com-
mittee, which began meeting in
April and has since held meetings
once a week.

“[BeaKid Night] has got alot of posit1'vefeed-
back already. A lot of students are really excited
about it,” Kasab said.

It will include activities intended to remind
students of their childhood. Eric Birzon, who
directs PPC’s lecture committee, was the ﬁrst
to suggest “Be a Kid Night” to the leisure com-
mittee. 1

“It’s a great way for college students to relieve
stress,”said Birzon, asenior majoringinaccount-
ing. “There’s not abetterway to relieve stress than
acting like a kid again.”

“Be a Kid Night’ ’will include children’s games
such as Bop—It and four square, alongwith Easy-
Bake Ovens and a “make your own slime” table.

Marianvanek, directorofPitt’s StudentHealth
Services, said that stress can increase anxiety,
make concentration diﬁicult and cause anger
and mood swings. The body and mind usually
recover quicklyfrom even acute stress andreturn

to normal functions.

“However, in certain circumstances, when
stress becomes chronic and the person has dif-.
ﬁculty coping, the body doesn’t have a chance to

' recover; this can lead to more serious‘ effects-,”

Vanek saidinanemail. . . _

These effects include gastroint_es1]'nal prob-
lems like diarrhea, constipation and complica-
tions for  GI conditions. Chronic stress
can also weaken the immune system and lead to
frequent colds.

friends and family members showed up

to support the inductees.

Ten candles with green ribbon wrapped
around them lined a red curtained table on
stage representing the goal areas of OCC
that students accomplished in order to be
inducted into the society.

The OCC program goal areas include:

cultural awareness, sense of self, service to
others, Pitt pride, wellness, appreciation

Students complete all goal areas to become inducted

When students complete all 10 goal
areas, they will be inducted into the OCC
Honorary Society, another new aspect to
the OCC program.

At the induction, Brooks swore Glyn
Cozart, a senior studying political science
and philosophy, in as president. Britta
Anderson was sworn in as vice president
of programming, Mark Hennessy as vice
president of membership, Hoover as busi-
ness manager and Samantha Bertocchi as
secretary.

Afterward, Brooks introduced Vice Pro-
vost and Dean of Students Kathy Hum-
phrey, who praised the students‘ for their
hard work.

“I could not be happier to look out at
you and see that you have invested in your-
selves,” Humphrey said.

In order to complete the OCC require-
ments, each student had to be interviewed
by Brooks. He then gave each of them the
option of joining the Honorary Society.
Landreneau and Hoover said that the

large majority of students chose to join

the society.

Kourtney Bernecker, a sophomore
studying politics and philosophy, started
completing the OCC requirements at her
freshman orientation. Bernecker said that
being involved as a First Year Mentor and
in her sorority, Delta Phi Epsilon, and
service fraternity, Epsilon Sigma Alpha,
helped her to complete the OCC require-
ments.

“I didn’t even have to try,” she said,
because she was already heavily involved
on campus.

Bernecker felt that being in the society
would continue to help her efforts to ‘be
employed after graduation. ’

“It does provide a lot of networking
opportunities, and it’s a great resume-
builder,” she said.

Cozart felt just as excited about leading
the newcommittee. She addressed the au-
dience after Humphrey praised the OCC.

“I’m honored that all of you are here,
and I hope you’re as excited as I am [about

» the society] ,” she said. '

At the end of her speech, naming all that
the inductees had accomplished in order
to show off green ties and scarves, she

‘asked the students to rise as they pledged

“to uphold the ideals of the OCC Honor-
ary Society.”

The pledge reaffirmed the purpose
of OCC, as the students simultaneously
said, “I will seek by all honorable means
to advance the interests of the University
of Pittsburgh, of my community and the
betterment of the world.”

Landreneau emphasized that OCC still
has work to do.

“This is not a ﬂawless program  but
it’s absolutely a step in the right direction,”
he said. “This is a program that’s not go-
ing anywhere.” I

EDITORIAL

Need-based aid
should be priority

Financial aid is often touted as a means
to lacilitateanotherwise unaffordable
education. Recently, however, colleges
have become less interested in assist-
ing disadvantaged students and more
in attracting top applicants, whether
thefre low-income or not. I
According to USA Today, uni-
versities will dispense $5.3 billion in
non-need-based aid this year while
need—based aid continues to decrease.
Compoundingthe problem, families
thatearnup to $180,000 annually-
well within the income bracket that
sends students to college regardless
of aid — will receive an additional $4
billion in federal tuition tax credits.
Many attribute the increase in
merit—based aid to certain ‘‘discounts’
that elite universities offerto desirable
applicants (Harvard, Yale and Stanford,
amongothers,waive tuitionforfamilies
with incomes up to $130,000). Inevita-
bly, less selective universitiesarefollow-
ing suit and, in doing so, disregarding
poorer students. In fact, a recent Na-
tional Center for Education Statistics
report found that non-need-based in-
stitutional merit aid ﬁ'om both public
and private collegeshas now surpassed
need—based institutional aid. .
Naturally, we ﬁnd this trend prob-
lematic. Ratherthanensuringstudents
can afford higher education,'univer-

sities now use ﬁnancial aid more as a_

recruiting tool — or, in the words of
Richard Kahlenberg, a specialist in

education at the Century Foundation,
a “bribe.” As one debt-encumbered

student complained to USA Today, .

“You don’t give the bloated  the
cheeseburger when the starving man
is starving.”

We’re less concerned with federal
tax credits — although we’d prefer

the focus remain on poor applicants, ,
T we hardly think an $180,000 income

renders higher education costs a non-
issue. Even public-related universities
like Pitt charge roughly $15,000 intu-
ition for instate students, an amount
that would strain nearly any house-
'hold’s pocketbooks.

Indeed, as we noted in an October
editorial, student ﬁnancial woes are
impossibleto resolve without stabiliz-
inguiition rates. While the government
should maintain its commitment to aid-
ing disadvantaged students, it should
also threaten to cut funding for public
universities that don’tkeeptheirt1Jition
in check, and increase their funding
when they do. Politicians on various
boards of trustees can apply pressure
to ensure this.

Until the government actually ad-
dresses unsustainabletuition increases,
however, universities should recon-
sidertheirﬁmdingpriorities. Financial
assistance is a valuable public service
and shouldbe treated as such by those
who bestow it. Recruitingtop students
is important, but it shouldn’t come at

  

the expense of need—based aid. I

Letter to the editor

To the Editor,

I’m writing in response to a Nov. 28

editorial, “Discontinue the Backyard

Brawl,” because I disagree with the

author’s stance that the annual foot-

ball game between Pitt and West Vir-

ginia should be cancelled because of
the craziness of WVU’s fans. _

The sort of violent and rude be-
havior at the heart of this article’s ar-
gument happens everywhere. I have
seen it happen at college basketball
and football games, MLB games and

. even high school football games —

rivalry games and non—rivalry games
alike. Fans everywhere are making it

difficult for teams’ fans to travel to
their away games. I’rn not saying that
every fan of every team exhibits this
behavior, but it’s not correct to make
sweeping generalizations thatallfans
of a given school are worse than all

fans of another school. ,
~ Even though unacceptable behav-
ior from fans happens everywhere,
it doesn’t mean it’s right. Maybe
instead of blaming every fan base
besides our own, we should ﬁnd ways
to prevent such behavior from oc-
curring. No one is‘ innocent in this
instance: not Pitt fans, notWVU fans,
not anyone. i
The landscape of college sports
maybe changing, but regardless,
Pitt and WVU will still be within 80
miles of each other and will still have
a century-old history that cannot be
ignored. Such trivial things like in-
appropriate displays of “fanhood”
should not cause the Backyard Brawl
to be thrown away with so much pas-
sion and tradition at stake.

A MIDWESTERN PIECE -

Christmas music encompasses

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

Whether it’s at the mall, the gro-
cery store, over the airwaves or
in the Steel Plaza “T” station,
we won’t escape it untiljanuary:
Christmas music.

Now that the holiday season
starts around mid—October, it’s
easy to feel a serious case of sil-
ver-bell fatigue. However much
I enjoyed listening to “Rudolph
the Red-Nosed Reindeer” the
first 187 times, there’s only so

much a man can take. By the time

Boxing Day rolls around, I ﬁnd
myselfwanting to roast chestnuts
on an open napalm ﬁre, nip like
Jack Frost at a songwriter’s nose,
undeck the halls, throw the Yule
log on old St. Nick and absolutely
avoid jingling bells at all costs.
As with any good thing, the
problem with Christmas music is
that there’s too much of it; every
department store or public space
wants to be festive. Of course, the

stores want to be festive without V

offending or excluding anybody,
so the playlist is limited to tunes
that don’t smack of religion and
those that people know or have
heard before. The music also has
to appeal to people of all ages.
The Lady Gaga Christmas album
won’t go over well with Grandma,
and the Bing Crosby Christmas
album is like, totally 50 years
ago to a devoted Little Monster.
Given these limitations, the typi-
cal musical lineup is limited to 12
pop songs, “Auld Lang Sync” and
a partridge in a pear tree. _'_I‘hose
songs grow tired just in the span
of one December, not to m%nti_on
a string of them.

This is really a shame, because
there are 800 years worth of

Christmas music available from '

countries around the world. Bach
wrote some excellent music for
the holiday, and although Handel
intended “The Messiah” for Eas-
ter, it’s been co-opted for Christ-
mas. (I’ve always been partial to
English and Polish carols, with an
occasional Swedish one thrown
in for good measure.)

It’s also worth noting that in

mas was mostly an occasion for
grown-ups to engage in heavy
drinking and trick-or—treating (or
“wassailing” if you prefer). The
mention of God was so cursory
and so often used as an excuse

Mike Rosenthal I Staff Illustrator

to have a good time that the Pu-
ritans actually banned celebrat-
ing the holiday in 1652. It didn’t
help that Christmas had all sorts
of pagan overtones. In fact, in
the case of things like Christmas

trees, it still does. Some holiday ’

carols might not be so pious af-
ter all.

I understand some of the
above music might offend peo-
ple’s tastes and religious orien-

tations, but they’d better under- 3,

stand that I’m at the end of my
tether with that stupid reindeer.
So how about we reach a com-
promise? Considering that we
aren’t members of Congress,
maybe we’ll actually find one.
Here’s _what I suggest to expand
our holiday listening horizons.
First, we should play carols
from around the world in lan-
guages other than English. If no-
body knows what the words are
or what they mean, who will get
‘offended? I speak Polish, have
heard Polish carols for years and

Learn to tolerate non-P.C. Christmas lyrics 

Kozlowski 4 5

know only a couple of them by
name, but I’m not sure that I’ve
ever understood the words. For a
long time I thought that in one of
them, the angels were announc-
ing a hole instead of a miracle: I
confused the word “dzura” with
the word “cuda.” And while reli-
ance on foreign carols would ap-
pear to violate the rule that holi-

day music be familiar, we should

consider that “Carolof the Bells”
is Ukrainian in origin. Lack of
renown for a particular carol is
nothing repetition can’t fix.
Second, make the carols as
ecumenical as possible. If people
want to write and play Hanuk-
kah, Kwanzaa or Eid songs for
balance, all the more power to
them. Failing that, it would be
very cool to have a klezmer ar-

rangement of some old classics
— The Shirim Klezmer Orchestra
released a klezmer Nutcracker
album in 1998 that makes for
great listening.

Third, if these first two sug-
gestions fail to catch on, the V0-
cal components of carols can be
doubled over with instruments
to create something purely or-

perfectly P.C. for a reason.
Fourth, people need to lighten
up. Words can be ignored easily
enough. They’re just words. 0f-
ten, this time of year is treated
as the central front for the ongo-
ing culture wars — conservatives
lament that there isn’t enough
Christianity in Christmas any-
more, and liberals lament that
there’s too much emphasis on

FOOTBALL

Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editor

The Pitt football team reached bowl
eligibility on Saturday afternoon
with a win over Syracuse in the
regular season ﬁnale.

The Panthers never trailed in
the 33-20 Senior Day win over the
Orange at Heinz Field, and the vic-
tory moves Pitt to a bowl—eligible

‘ 6-6 record. Syracuse also needed a

win to qualify for albowl bid.

“[A bowl game] just shows the
body of work we put into it,” senior
right guard Lucas Nix said. “It pays
off in the end  you get another.
game and you get to spend another
few weeks with the family we built
here. That means as much to us as
anything.”

In the fourth quarter, it looked
like the Panthers would lose an-
other double-digit lead this season
—— Pitt jumped out to a 10-point
advantage in the ﬁrst quarter — but
outside linebacker Brandon Lind-
sey and cornerback Antwuan Reed
had other plans. "

Syracuse had the ball with less
than three minutes remaining with
Pitt holding a 26-20 advantage.

Lindsey sacked Orange quarter-
back Ryan Nassib, forcing a ﬁimble,
and cornerback Reed scooped up
the ball and ran into the end zone.
The touchdown boosted Pitt’s lead
to 33-20.

Andrew Taglianetti sealed the
victory on Syracuse’s next posses-
sion with an interception.

Pitt forced six turnovers against
the Orange, the ﬁrst time the Pan-
thers had six forced turnovers since
2002, which they accomplished in
_a game against Ohio.

“The coaches have been really
stressing turnovers in practice,”
Reed said. “We just kept going at
it. We just tried to go out there and
help the team the best we can with
defense and special teams.”

The win was particularly im-

aportant to the Panthers not only
because they wanted to earn bowl

' eligibility and honor the seniors,

but also because defensive coor-
dinator Keith Patterson’s father
passed away this week and the team
wanted to win for him.

“I’m sure my dad would have
something to critique me on today,”
Patterson said. “What a great coach,

what a great man. What a tremen-
dous man he was  [I’m] just trying
to pass that on to young men and
instill the discipline and focus and
love for the game.”

Taglianetti said the Panthers
knew‘ that a victory would~“mean
the most to him.”

“He even said to us today that
this was the ﬁrst time he never
talked to his dad before a football
game,” Taglianetti said. “That kind
of hit us deep.”

Pitt’s defense has performed well
all season — holding opponents to
22.6 points per game — but recently
started forcing more turnovers, a
goal the coaches set at the begin-
ning of the season.

“I’ve never seen somebody pres-
sure the quarterback as much as we
have and be unable to force and take
advantage of opportunities to turn
the ball over,” Patterson said.

Redshirt freshman outside line-
backer Todd Thomas said it took
some time for the Panthers to adjust
to the new defense.

“Everybody has to get used to
it,” Thomas said. “But now I think
everyone has molded together as
a defense and learned what they
have to do.” 3

The team’s performance against
Syracuse showed what the Panthers
are capable of, Taglianetti said.

Panthers beat Orange on Senior

Bobby Mizia | Senior StaffPhotographer;
Anthony Gonzalez scored a touchdown as quarterback in the wildcat formation to give Pitt a 17-7 lead at
the end ofthe first quarter. The Panthers eventually defeated Syracuse 33-20.

“I think we are better than a
6-6 team by far,” he said. “We had
a couple tough losses. It doesn’t do
anyone any good to  take it the
wrong way and be frustrated about
what’s going on. We just had to pull
together and keep ﬁghting.”

Pitt also had to ﬁght through
several injuries this season. Senior
tailback Zach Brown and freshman
receiver/kick returner Ronaldjones
sat out against the Orange with a
bruised stemum/ribs and a concus-
sion, respectively.

Pitt’s lost ﬁve offensive contribu-
tors to season-ending injuries this
year, including standout running
back Ray Graham.

The injuries gave several young
players the chance to step in and
perform, including freshmen Corey
Davis and Isaac Bennett. Davis
ﬁnished with 58 receiving yards,
while Bennett added 30 yards on the
ground and 41 rushing yards.

Pitt quarterback Tino Sunseri
threw for 179 yards and a touch-
down on 14-19 passing. Receiver
Alec Lemon led Syracuse with 87
receiving yards. Nassib ﬁnished 13-
19 for 156 yards and a touchdown.

The Panthers jumped out to a
quick lead after Syracuse fumbled
the kickoff and Tristan Roberts re-
covered. Sunseri completed a pass
to tailback Bennett for a 22-yard

touchdown, giving the Panthers a
7-0 advantage; ,

Lindsey intercepted Orange
quarterback Ryan Nassib on Syra-
cuse’s ﬁrst drive. The turnover led
to a 37-yard Kevin Harper ﬁeld goal
and a 10-0 lead for Pitt.

N assib answered with a 26-yard
touchdown pass to Antwon Bailey to
cut Pitt’s leadto three, but Anthony
Gonzalez stepped in at quarterback
in the wildcat formation for Pitt,
rushing 17 yards for a touchdown
that gave the Panthers a 17-7 lead at
the end of the ﬁrst quarter.

The Orange struck ﬁrst in the
second quarter with-a 22-yard ﬁeld
goal, but Pitt answered. with a 36-
yard ﬁeld goal before the break to

go into the locker room with a 20-

10 lead.

A 10-yard rushing touchdown by
Jerome Smith in the third quarter
slimmed Pitt’s advantage to 20-17,
but Kevin Harper hit two more ﬁeld
goals before the end of the third
quarter. Pitt entered the fourth with
a 26-17 advantage.

Ross Krautman hit a ﬁeld goal
for Syracuse early in the fourth
quarter to make the score 26-20.

“I think this senior group has
laid a great foundation,” Todd Gra-
ham said. “I’m really thankful for
how they embraced me. We gave
them everything we had.” .

MEN’S BASKETBALL

 

Panthers pick up roa  

Sean Corrado
Staff Writer

Ashton Gibbs led a second-half run
and made a key defensive play in the
ﬁnal seconds of Saturday’s game to
lead the Pit men’s basketball team to
a road victory over Tennessee in the
Big East-SEC Challenge.

With the Panthers leading by one
point, 44-43, with just under nine
minutes left in the game, Gibbs took
overscoring. He scored Pitt’s next nine
points, leading a 9-2 run for Pitt that
built a 53-45 advantage.

Gibbs sealedthe 61—56victorywhen
he stripped the ball ﬁ'om Tennessee
point guard Trae Golden and forced
a jump ball with the Panthers holding
onto atwo-pointlead. The possession
arrow pointed in Pitt’s favor.

“[Gibbs] played with a lot of con-
ﬁdence, and I think that spread to the
team,” Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon
saidinapostgame press conference. “I
thinkthatwasthe biggestthing.We’ve
got who knows how many freshmen
out there, and I think his conﬁdence
kind of spread to the teamas the game
went on and those young guys made
some good plays.”

The key defensive play took place

after Pitt center Dante Taylor missed
a one-and-one with 11 seconds left in
the game. Gibbs tied up Golden, then
freshman guardjohnjohnson broke
away for a layup and a 3-point play to
seal the victory in the  seconds.

“We run aﬂat series where he’s at-
tacking off the dribble, which is great
for us,” Tennessee head coach Cuonzo
Martin said in a postgame press con-
ference. “Unfortunately, [Gibbs] got
the jump ball call. We wanted him to
really attack off the bounce, and Ash-
ton Gibbs did a good job of getting his
hands on the ball.”

Tennessee guard Cameron Tatum

said in a postgame press conference i

that Gibbs’ run stemmed from acom-
bination of the Volunteers’ not play-

ing ball screens and Pitt’s offensive '

rebounding.

“We triedto keep him on one side,
and once he gotinthe middle and there
wasn’t much of a hedge guy there on
the screens, he had shots,”TaI11m said.
“Some of the offensive rebounds they
got, they kicked it back out to him and
he was wide open.”

With starting point guard Tray
Woodall out for a month with a groin
injury, the Panthers struggled with ball
movement in the ﬁrst half.

press conference that Robinson has
always been a talented rebounder. ,

“He’s a really smart basketball
player,” Miller said. “He knows the
spots to get on the ﬂoor and places
to get to go and get those rebounds.
He does a really good job of reading it
after it leaves the shootefs hands and
judgingtrajectory and knowingwhere
the ball’s going to end up.”

Gibbs, Pitt’s leading scorer, split
"time withjohn Johnson at the point.
Gibbs’ shots weren’t falling early, but he
improvedtowardthe end ofthe second
half, scoring 10 of his 16 points after
the break.

“I think we ground it out, and that
was good to see,” Dixon said. “We had
to get stops down the stretch and that’s
what we di ” '

Bothjohnson and redshirt fresh-
man guard Cameron Wright saw

“[Wright] didn’t make shots — he
took some good ones —— but he de-

And he took good shots, except maybe
one, but that’s within the offense and

13 points and 11 rebounds. Butthe Vol-

bounds — the Panthers ﬁnished with
17 offensive rebounds to Tennessee’s

Pitt shotjust12-33 before the break, 

but a combination of eight offensive
rebounds and seven Tennessee tum-
overs kept the Panthers alive early. Pitt
regained the lead on a 7-0 run to end
the ﬁnal 4:21 of the half, bringing the
score to 27-26 in the Panthers’ favor.
The Volunteers came out strong on
defense out of the break, holding Pitt
scoreless for the ﬁrst four minutes.
Tennessee captured a small four-
point lead with 14 minutes remaining,
but after junior Dante Taylor scored

on a dunk and a jumper on back-to— .

and never gave it back.

“In the secondhalf, Pitt made their

Sophomore guard Chelsea Gray recorded
the fourth trip1e—double in Duke history on
Sunday when the No. 7 Blue Devils routed
the Pitt women’s basketball team.

“I came out with 10 minutes to go, and
Coach put me back in a couple of minutes
later,” Gray said in a postgame press con-
ference; “Coach Candice [Jackson] told

Gray scored 14 points, dished out a
school-record 13 assists and grabbed 11

me to get two rebounds. I looked up and
saw I had eight rebounds, so I just went
after it.” ,

It was the second consecutive loss for
the Panthers, as they fell to High Point
82-75 on Friday. ‘

Duke never trailed in the game, start-
ing the contest on a 17-3 scoring run. Pitt’s
Brianna Kiesel interrupted the Blue Devils
with a 3-pointer after Duke jumped out
to a 6-0 lead. But the Blue Devils quickly
responded, scoring 11 straight points to
build a 17—3 lead before Kyra Dunn stopped
the onslaught with a layup.

“You just hope that you learn,” Pitt head
coach Agnus Berenato said in a postgame
press conference. “I said to my point guard
with about 12 minutes left, ‘Okay [Brianna},
this is just practice.’ We don’t have‘ players
like this; we don’t have guy players like this.
So just focus and try to learn one thing.”

The Blue Devils fed off the fast start —
holding Pitt without a field goal for the
ﬁnal eight minutes of the ﬁrst half — and
proceeded to build an insurmountable 49-
22 advantage by halftime.

Duke shotjso percent from the ﬁeld
and seven players reached double digits,
including Tricia Liston with 19 points and
Chloe Wells with 14.

“Having seven people in double ﬁgures
shows tremendous balance and opportu-
nity,” Duke head coachjoanne P. McCallie
said in a postgame press conference. “Chel-
sea [Gray] — not surprised at all. She has
a variety of skill sets and today, obviously,
she put a lot of things together.”

Comprised of only freshmen and sopho-
mores, the young Panthers shot 23.7 per-
cent from the ﬁeld and 41.7 percent from
beyond the arc. Pitt turned the ball over
24 times, compared to one turnover for
Duke.

Kiesel led Pitt with 12 points.

“I wrote it on the board today —— we are
preparing for the future,” Berenato said
about her young team. “I love this team, I
really do. I don’t know what we are going
to do in the win—loss column, but I have to
tell you, I love this team. I think that you
can tell them anything you want and they
will say ‘Yes, Coach!’ It is really a pleasure
working with them and coaching them. It
was a great experience for us.”

Duke has won 28 straight games at Cam-
eron Indoor Stadium.
