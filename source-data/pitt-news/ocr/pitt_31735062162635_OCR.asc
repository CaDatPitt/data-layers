He elaborated on the services which include: mail service,

telephone and telegraph, stenography, travel, purchasing,

‘property and supplies, printingﬁ

and audio-visual aids.

Smith was questioned by the
SGA members following his talk.
The question of who gets ﬁrst

in the university always get,ﬁrst
preference. .“Rud” jobs are done
next. . P

Smith further commented that —
the printing service is now pre-
paring‘ a style booklet which
will explain what types" of ma-
terial are available, so that or-
ganizations will know whatthey

Renaissance Art

Subject of Works

A Valuable collection of cop-
ies of famous painting by Ital-
ian Renaissance artists has
been given to the uniVers_ity’s
Henry Clay '"Frick Fine Arts
Department. A gift from

Helen -C. Frick, the collection is
the work of Nicholas Lochoff, a
Russian painter. ' .-. '

A portion of the collection is
now on display in the Commons
Room of the Cathedral. through
Dec._ 31. Included in the exhibit
are 12 selections representing the
14th, '15th and 16th century o
Italian painting. ‘

The entire collection consists
of 13 frescoes, eight panels, and
two canvasses. Entitled ““The

Nicholas Lochoff Collection of

Reconstructions of Italian Mas-

terpieces,” the paintings include

the works of Duccio, Giotto, Bot-
ticelli, Masaccio, and others.

Nicholas Lockoﬁ was commis-
sioned by the Tsar of Russia in
1911‘ to go to Italy to make a
series of replicas of the old mast-
ers for the ‘Moscow Museum of
Fine Arts.

Bernard Berenson, one of the
great art connoisseurs of today,
said,“‘One glance at these paint-
ings was enough to show .me -that
Lochoff’s copies were indeed very
different from. all other copies.
‘They are almost unbelievably ac-
curate reconstructions of the orig-
inal pictures.”

 

ATTENTION!

On or about Nov. 23 in conjunc-

tion with the Student Employ-
ment Service, we will begin print-
ing a list of».jobs. These will ap-

meaning of his visit went on
around campus?”

    library 0-operation

 T In opening their facilities on Sunday afternoons, library
' oﬁlcials have done a commendable service to university stu-
T dents. Although the need for longer library, hours has un-
doubtedly been prevalent for some time, it has been only re-
A cently that the student body made known its wishes.

Lorena Garloch and her staff have been more than will-
ing to meet these wishes. Miss Garloch stated at Monday’s
SGA meeting that the use of the libraries could be extend-
("red even further if -student demand is great enough.

- As the new hours for Sundayare set up now, the ﬁfth
, and sixth floor libraries will be open from 2 to 5 p.m. On
Sunday students who use the library will be polled to dis-
"cover whetherthere is enough reason to keep the libraries -
. open Sunday evenings. ' ' ‘I , A

The only advantage to this pollis that the library may A

I may take some time for students to become accustomed to
'l theidea-that they can ‘use the libraries at this new time.

After a few Sundays, however, we feel that library of-' ‘
ﬁcials will realize the need for longer hours on that par-
ticular day of the week. There is still a further need, though. »
If the library were to remain open later on“ weekday eve-

' nings, students would beneﬁt even more.

.‘ Perhaps an “ideal” library schedule would be as follows!
 Weekdays—-8 a.m. to 11 p.m.; Saturdays-8 a.m. to 5 p.m.;
Sundays-2 p.m. to 9 p.m.

Keeping the library open during these extra hours, of

\ course, presents problems, the biggest of which is maintain-

ing a staff, both for the library and for security in the Ca-.
‘ thedral of Learning.

'For— the time being this_problem must be met with no

V complaints from the officials. After all, what is $15 per Sun-

day to the library now compared to the seven million dollars
it will take to erect an entirely new library building.

Until that time when a separate building to house the
libraries is a‘ reality, both students and library officials
must work together to provide the best facilitiespossible.

h Theoﬂicials appear ready" and willing to do their part.

- ‘The students, then, must take care of their end and put the

extra hours to acceptable use. It is unreasonable to expect

' the library staff to alter its schedule if the —facilities will go
unused. ' ’ ' ,

Summer Report: 8 . . .

 Wanied: |n’re|

By'David Breaks‘!-one
When the blue-green rows of lights on the run-
way at Idlewild Airport slanted lazily into sight

last September 4, I shifted uncomfortably in my,

belted confinement and softly muttered to no one
in particular, “Now what are you going to do?”

The question had more than momentary, “what
a letdown,” signiﬁcance. I had
been thinking rather carefully in
Paris during those last burnished
days of summer how I was going
to react upon returning home,
and to what use I might be able
to put the summer’s novel exper-
iences.

While certain that I would
not orate in public about the
trip, I was not exactly certain
what I would do. ' V -

As it has turned out, I have
continued thinking (perhaps actually reminiscing)
and not doing much — a fatal weakness. I still
have yet to come up with the prize idea on how
to make a quick killing on the deal —~ intellectu-
ally speaking, of course.

Two Points of Observance '

Before throwing out some of my wild ideas on
this matter, I would like to.summarize brieﬂy two
thoughts which have persisted in bouncing around
in my consciousness since September. They are
both idealistic as hell, but no one comes back from
a summer abroad without a few more ounces of
idealism (and world-conquering illusions) than
he had when he trudged off. , ,,.

As soon as the ocean gets between the traveler
and_ America, he begins to see himself as other
people in the world’ see him. The artist. calls this
“aesthetic distance,” I prefer to say simply “per-

spective.” The American " ﬁnds that he is unshak- . .

ably [an American, everyone seems toknow it
wherever he goes, as much as he would at times
like to “lose” himself. I » 4
On a breezy, clear morning in late July I sat
in’the’ Grand Cafe of" Progress, in Grenoble, hav-
ing a beer with _my pretty young teacher. In the
course of the conversation, I asked her why the
French dislike Americans. She replied that they

didn’t dislike the ‘Americans, but that they con- ’.
. sidered_ them “grands enfants?’ —- big babies.

Serious Nof Superficial
,.Why? “Because the Americans we have seen
are carefree, happy-go-lucky people who seem not

 

to have ever had a problem in their lives," she
replied. “Your countrymen are not interested in
serious world affairs or even in intellectual matters;
they like to laugh and drink their time away --
like spoiled children, I think.” .

The situation has tragic implications. If we are,
in fact, viewed in such a contemptuous light, what
does this mean in terms of the so-called “allied
partnership” against Niki’s boys? Does not a seri-

ous lack of faith and trust lead to a facade alli-I
ance?‘ That is the ﬁrst point that I have been

brooding about.'The second is a logical consequence
of the ﬁrst.

If ‘ we are the marvelous land of wealth and
plenty that Europeans seemgto think we are, are

-we not squandering our resources on pleasure and
escaping with wild abandon and purpose toward

a shorter work week by means of longer strikes?
The Old World looks to us for leadership and as-
sistance, and we reply with a slap on the back

' and the crack that “this is the best of all possible

times.” Perhaps if the ocean were not ‘such a good
insulator we would think otherwise.
Small Scale Revision‘

_The European impression is not an altogether
accurate one. _But the way to correct it is some-
what more diﬂicult. lam not proposing a drastic

revision of our foreign policy (impossible) or a-
nation-wide reform of morality (improbable), but

I do think that we ought to get more intelligent

‘young Americans to Europe who are-willing to

travel and talk. a

As I have mentioned earlier, young Europeans
virtually clog the roads of the Continent during
the summer. Over the campﬁres of the youth
hostels and in the dim '_cafes, ideas and stories 'are
exchanged. The net result is friendship — some-
thing that we sorely need._A V '

And thus I have come to the “wild idea" part

ligent Tourists 

of the pitch. All the ‘alive young Americans sitting _

in the twilight of the Commons Room, or glumly
following the beknighted football team, take heed!
’.l‘here.’s a plane that’s leavin’ soon for London.
The round-trip ‘fare is_ unbeatablyi low, and the
stay in Europe is four weeks. I estimate that a
penny-pinching pauper could" do the trip for $600.

How? With the schemes that I noticed being
employed last summer. And I am quite willing
and eager to get together with interested students
who would like to have a wonderful vacation next

-summer and also give our staggering reputation

and world position a shot in the arm. .End of series.

Letters To TheTEdtor

Need Academic. ‘Spirit
Rather Than Athletic

:Editor, the Pitt News:'

How long must Pitt "students
be subjected to this. tripe about
school spirit at the
games? When I entered Pitt, I
was under the impression that a
university was ﬁrst and fore-
most a place of higher learning.

I was also under.the impres-

' sion that scholarships (especial-

ly the room and board, complete
tuition type which the football
players enjoy) Were given 10
people who had shown consid-
erable academic _ achievement.
Needless to say, I was misin-
formed on both counts.

The students here at the uni-
versity are" forever being urged
to support the football team, the
basketball team, ping—pong team,
the marbles team, etc., etc. Yet
I hear very little_ concern ex-
pressed among students over
Pitt’s academic standing.

The caliber of scholar which
the university turns out seems
to be much less signiﬁcant than
the caliber of quat‘.terback.t If
school spirit is needed anywhere,
it is in the academic, not the
athletic ﬁeld.

The attitude of the supposedly
more mature alumni
more anti-intellectual. One need
only compare the amount of
alumni contributions for athletic

scholarships to the amount for -

‘scholastic scholarships to verify
this statement. Candidates for
scholastic scholarships are re-
quired to ﬁlll out extremely per-
sonal forms to prove that they
really “need” the money.

-Says Faculty Sluﬂers

The attitude of the alumni,-

however, is no concern of mine.

’ If they would rather see Pitt as

a basic training ‘center for -the
Pittsburgh Steelers than as an
institution of higher learning,

’ there is little the student body
can do (or wants to do).

Since even in this_ totalitarian
university, however, the student

has a few rights left, I choose to.
. exercise mine by not attending

football games, thus showinga
lack of “school spirit.”
I_ would like tomake it clear

..that I am in no way opposed to

football or any other form of
athletics, so long as it remains
in the area of extracuccicular
activities. --
. But when a university is will-
ing to spend more money for "a
winning football team than for

the education of its scholars, it

ceases to be an institution of

‘learning and. becomes nothing

but a gloriﬁed gymnasium. I am

not ‘paying $25 a credit_to be a

spectator. '

Casual Dress ’0k‘aycd

.By Irate Sophomore

Editor, the Pitt News:
I like my female classmates.
I could not like ‘them if I did not

respect them. I could not ‘respect.

them if they “were not brought
up any better than to be sloppy
in public” or if they “dress in
such a way as to be suggestive,"
to quote the letter of_A Fresh-
man Woman in the Wednesday
issue of the Pitt News.

The majority of Pitt women
dress in good taste, be itvin the
mode of dresses and high‘ heels,
that of more casual wear -- or,
yes, even thatof (shudder) ber-
mudas! ‘

I fail to comprehend how
these typical young women at-
tired in ' button—down shirts,
crew neck sweaters and skirts or
bermudas (knee-sox optional, 01
course) could be considered
sloppily or above all, suggestive-

ly dressed.

If this is so, every girl at
Chatham‘ is‘, without doubt, sug-
gestively dressed —- a waste of
effort, _don’t. you think?
