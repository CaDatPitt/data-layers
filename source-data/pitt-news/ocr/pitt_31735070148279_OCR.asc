U. 8. Rep.
Altmire
talks with
students

Gideon Bradshaw
For The Pitt News

U.S. Rep. Jason Altmire gave a quick
prediction for nextyeafs presidential
election as part of a talk with 10 Pitt
students Monday afternoon.

“If [Republican presidential candi-
date Mitt] Romney is the [Republican]
nominee, he’s gotashotto win. If they
nominate any other out of that cast of
characters, forget i ” Altmire, D. Pa.,
said — even with President Barack
Obama’s supportwaningin key swing
states.

Altmire spoke for about 40 min-
utes in the reading room of Pitt’s
Honors College to answer students’
questions about the national budget,
energy policy and ﬁmding cuts to edu-
cation.The students called attention
to the recent reduction in the educa-
tion budget at both the federal and
state levels.

“The worst place to cut the budget
is ourﬁ.1ture,”Altmire saidinresponse.
He said that making cuts to essential
services like education is not the right
way to ﬁx the budgets.

Instead, Altmire advocated closing
“unnecessaryprograms,” speciﬁcally
citingafederal highway program un-
dertheDepartmentof'1‘ransportation
that sent employees abroad to study
billboards in locations like Australia
and Europe. He said he wrote a letter
to the Secretary ofTransportation Ray
LaHood criticizingthe programinline
with public outcry over the taxpayer-
ﬁmded trips. The program was sus-
pended injune.

“Over time, that was millions of
dollars that was being wasted,” Alt-
mire said.

Senior Becky Schroeder asked
Altmire about the controversial

Occupiers make Downtown camp base home

Shaé Felicien
Staﬁ Writer

A._]. Walker is tired. Weary-eyed, the
28-year-old stands at the kitchen tent
with afriend’s dog, Hitchhiker, looking
for a cup of coffee. Saturday night he
was on night patrol, walking up and
down rows of tents in search of any
signs of trouble.

“We’ve supposedly had some ru-
morsgoingaround onthelnternetthat
there are going to be people coming
here to attempt to incite ﬁst ﬁghts
throughout the camp,” Walker said.
“Allwaspretty quietlast nightthough,
nothing happen ”

Walker, from Pittsburgh’s South
Side,isone of morethanzoo occupiers
who took to the streets of Pittsburgh
on Oct. 15 and crafted their residence
on Mellon Green Downtown, birth-

ing the Occupy Pittsburgh movement.
Now, three weeks later, that movement
continues to organize and advance an
at-t1'mes-confused public presence. Oc-
cupy movements have formed nation-
wide to protest corporate greed, social
injustices and disparities between the
rich and the poor.

Walker spends most of his time at
the Occupy camp base, helping out in
any capacity that he can. He’s only left
the camp a few times since it was set

. up, those times to work odd jobs in
construction. He said he hopes to one b

day return to school. ’

Alter afew days atthe encampment,
he adjusted to the cold. Though he said
the hours sometimes begin to blur, he
nevertheless remains committed.

“There’s a good thing happening
here, andlwantto be apart of anything
good that’s happening,” Walker said.

Located between the Downtown
intersections of Sixth Avenuewith Ross
and Grant streets, Occupy Pittsburgh
initially looks like arecovery stationfor
victims of a natural disaster.

But upon further investigation,
the large tents, tarps and cardboard
and wooden pathways each serve a
purpose. Large tents, often covered
in tarps to protect against rain, offer
shelter for a medic, apainting station,
an information center, a library and
akitchen equippedwith hot plates, ﬁre
extinguishers and supplies offood and
water.

The tents have all been numbered
in anetfortto keep acensus. As of Sat-
urday night, 106 tents were set up.

Throughout the day, the kitchen
staifworksto stock and distribute do-
nations that arrive from contributotsto
the cause. Each daya changing assort-

ment of supporters drop off food, sup-
plies, gift cards and cash donations.
Jimmy Blue Thunder, 51, of Ana-
darko, Okla., sipped coffee while wait-
ing to receive one of the sandwiches
donated only moments earlier.

Shouts of “meat” run throughout
the camp.

“We getalot ofvegan and vegetar-
ian food donated, so it’s nice when we
carnivores get fed,” Blue said, smiling
with sandwich in hand.

Blue Thunder, a member of the
Lenni Lenape tribe, hasfound himself
in a puzzling predicament.

Aﬁzerﬁnding outthathe had stage-
three kidney disease, he could notﬁnd
work. “No one will hire me,” he said.

Jobless, Blue Thunder was eventually
forced to spend three months living

the 1999 season. Sandusky was ar-
raigned Saturday in State College on
40 counts related to the sexual—abuse
case againsthimandwas released on
$100,000 bail.

Patemo, in his 46th season as
Penn State’s head coach, will not be
charged, authorities said.

In a four—page release, the At-
torney General’s Ofﬁce said Patemo
was informed by a graduate-assistant
football coach in March 2002 that
he had witnessed Sandusky alleg-
edly involved in sexual activity with
a boy in the "showers of the Lasch
Football Complex, where Sandusky
maintained an oﬂice after his retire-
ment.

Patemo, 84, the all—time win-
ningest coach in Division 1 football,
had no comment Saturday, athletic
department spokesman Jeff Nelson
said. However, Patemo might notbe
completely in the clear. Twenty of the
40 counts ﬁled against Sandusky al-
legedly tookplace duringthe time he
worked for Patemo,‘ including three
counts of involuntary deviate sexual

intercourse, a ﬁrst-degree felony. ' " T

Penn State rep

now troubled  

Events this weekend shone light on
an issue that hits close to home for
us at Pitt.

Former Penn State assistant foot-
ball coachjerry Sanduskywas charged
with 40 criminal counts related to a
child-abuse case against him. Penn
State Athletic Director Tim Curley
and interim Senior Vice President for
Finance and Business Gary Schultz
are both charged with perjury and
failure to report the alleged incidents
to proper authorities following the
charges posed against Sandusky.

One individual typically carmot
bring disgrace to an entire institution,
but the fact that several administra-
tors are under ﬁre concerns us for
Penn State’s future. University Presi-
dent Graham Spanier and even head
football coachjoe Paterno have also
been criticized for how they handled
the alleged situation. No official de-
cision has been made on the alleg-
edly involved parties, and they are
innocent unﬁl proven guilty. But the
scandal has already taken its toll on
what was formerly lauded as a clean,
moral university.

Merely juxtaposing the Penn State
name with child abuse is damaging
enough. Alumni mightthink twice
about their donations. Future ap-

plicants might be inclined to opt for ‘

other schools. The legacy of Penn
State football might crumble.
It’sashame, but ifthese allegations

I are proven true, Penn State’s adminis-

trationwillhave to take steps to better
itself—— not only to rebuild its reputa-
tion, but also its integrity No similar
scandal in recent college history has

I concerned the nation more than this

one. If the university really did try
to cover something up, it could have
caused more damage and suffering
than it would have by punishing the
initial wrongdoer.

And what about other schools?

The possibility of something like this .

happeningwill likely be a blow to uni-

versities nationwide. If it can poten- 7

tially happen at Penn State, where else
might this be going on?

Regardless, we think there needs
to be a strict code of conduct when it
comes to reporting incidents like child
abuse. There is a moral duty — and
an arguably intrinsic one for most of
us —— that one has to go to the police if
he knows of something so serious.

Involuntary deviate sexual inter-
course with aminor, one of Sandusky’s
charges, is a class—one felony. Accord-
ing to the grand jury presentment, a
graduate assistant allegedly reported

. to Paterno that he saw Sandusky hav-

ing sexwithaminorinalocker-room
shower; and that information did not
make its way to police.

What would be your ﬁrst incli-
nation if you witnessed an armed
robbery, another class—one felony?
Without hesitation —- and if our lives
weren’t in danger — we’d take the
information to police and let them
handle it.

If you have the unforumate experi-
ence of seeing something horriﬁc -
be it rape, robbery, assault or anything
else that endangers the well-being of
another person — you have an obli-
gation to report it, if you won’t incur
any harm. And the police should be
the ﬁrst people you speak to. More
harm can come about if these events
stay under wraps. Predators rack up
countless victims because events often
go unreported.

What’s alleged here is vile and
does not reﬂect the values of higher
education. We hope thatwrongdoers
are punished and the innocent are
able to clear their names. Penn State
students, athletes and supporters do
not deserve to see their school’s repu-
tation disintegrate, and justice needs
to be served as soon as possible.

But for now, all we can do is wait
and wonder how something like this
could possibly happen so close to
home.

Think we're crazy?

THE SCHAFFIDAVIT

Libraries can cut costs with
new eBook technology

Matt Schaff
Columnist

College administrators like sniff-
ing for ways to save a buck. Not
like that’s ever been questioned,
but it’s especially true now —
cornered by appropriation-re-
ducing politicians and the rising
costs of providing higher educa-
tion, university budget overseers
are primed to jump at any savings
opportunity.

To this end, many have chosen
to pool resources with surround-
ing schools or outsource their
traditional functions to private
firms. Here’s another seldom-
discussed idea: bringing technol-
ogy into campus libraries.

That’s weird, you might say.
Doesn’t keeping university fa-
cilities in-tune with the latest
technological advancements
carry a hefty price tag? Yes, and
it’s possible — as some econo-
mists have famously argued -
that the ongoing race to equip

might be contributing to the
much—maligned higher-ed cost
explosion. But that doesn’t mean
“technifying” deserves no place
in the playbook of administrators
itching to do “more with less.”
A recent development in library
collection services suggests, at
least in this case, the opposite.
In defense of chopping—b1ock-po-
sitioned academic programs and
professors’ salaries, I think this
library technology is a potential
cost-saving measure that should
be given due consideration.

The online publication Inside
Higher Ed reported last week on
the concept of Patron—Driven
Acquisition, or PDA (although
free, publicly displayed affec-
tion doesn’t improve a college’s
bottom line). PDA is an uncon-
ventional model of large—scale
book collection that a new re-
port published by D.C.—based
consulting firm The Education
Advisory Board projects will
dominate collegiate libraries in
the future. The Board’s report de-

scribes PDA as a demand-based
offering of eBooks, a system
through which publishing com-
panies grant students access to
their entire catalogs of eBooks
but only make schools pay for
books that students most regu-
larly access ‘— not unlike the
pay—per—swipe deal between Pitt
and Port Authority. Grand Valley
State University in Michigan has
test—driven the PDA model, and
according to Inside Higher Ed,
the savings were striking. When
Grand Valley students accessed
6,289 eBooks in 2009, only 343
were requested enough to reach
the purchase threshold. When
applied in a more comprehen-
sive sense, the EAB argues, such
a system could potentially free up
a signiﬁcant amount of cash.
Now I always hesitate when
mortals claim to hold the future
in their hands. Consider once-
popular statements like “housing
prices will increase forever” and
“the world will end on [insert

past date set by a now—discred-
ited religious figure],” and you’ll
get the picture. But whereas the
future role of PDA in libraries
across the college spectrum
should be understood as uncer-
tain, its demonstrated prospect
is encouraging. '

Let’s face it — in the age of
Google and eReaders, monolithic
stone buildings filled with stacks
of paper-and-glue bindings col-
lecting dust over time seem like

excellent candidates for accus,a- -. -'
tions of inefficient use of space 

and energy. In contrast, proper

implementation of PDA would .

require minimal space allotment,
save for a few servers and “in-
formation” kiosks, and the labor
costs needed to maintain grow-
ing physical inventories would
suddenly vanish.

And it’s much more than that.
PDA could protect both admin—
istrators and students from the
risks of speculation. At the mo-
ment, libraries, with limited pur-
chasing resources, are forced to
speculate as to what titles will be
demanded in the future. Like any

gambling activity with deﬁned ’

risk, bets go sour — expensive
books regularly sit on shelves for
months without a single check—
out. Students also suffer from
speculation risk when they have
to wait for desired books to ar-
rive from other libraries when
their own haven’t bet on stock-
ing them.

Although counterintuitive,
by setting the stage for a free-
market equilibrium in books,

the hypothetical scenario where
eBooks are interchangeable with
hard copies, PDA would match
up every. student consumer with
the demanded material, instan-

- taneously. One person’s use of

an electronic document.doesn’t

impede another’s, and thus PDA‘
would avoid the overflow of sup- "

ply and unquenched demand that
characterize current library in-
ventories, saving university dol-
lars along the way. 1

,_.: Surely, there are problems
Iwitihr. PDA. For one, there’s

something to be said about
maintaining a physical record

» of mankind’s accomplishments

— that’s why PDA might fit best
at smaller schools, as opposed to
big research institutions like Pitt.
A related issue is that a market
system could cause books with
low demand but high societal
value —— such as Baruch Spinoza’s
1677 philosophical work “On the
Improvement of the Understand-
ing,” for instance — to fall into
oblivion.

But these problems aren’t_in-(

. surmountable, especially, 
s.idering how, to a certain exten_t,j_
most universities are already do; 

ing this. Whether demand-based?
or not, the subscriptions they pay
for currently provide millions of
students with access to academic
journals and other periodicals.
As cost-cutting zeal continues,
administrators would not be mis-
taken to consider adding “books”
to that list. I

as reasons to explain why relation-
ships don’t work.

“The Boomerang” is the person
who keeps breaking up and then re-

visiting the same relationship, even _

V though nothing has changed. We all
know these people.

“The Detective” constantly

searches for the perfect man (or
woman): the best man, the macho
man, the man with the slamming
body, etc. Any prospective part-
ner has to ﬁt all of those criteria. (I
might ﬁt into this category.)

Finally, the “Picky Picker” is the
person that nags and nags until his
or her partner can’t take it anymore.
It’s exhausting.

If you have commitment issues,
you probably fall into one of these
categories.

Members of both genders and
all sorts of sexual orientations can
experience the fear of commitment,
for multiple reasons —— it doesn’t
have to be because of a desire for
independence. Maybe you just got

out of a emotionally draining part-

nership, for example.

In any case, this is a brutal cycle.
In fact, Dr. Amir Levine, a New York
City psychiatrist, told CBS News that
a fear of dependence is one of the

most common reasons for remain— , _
ing single —. and the only way one

Next, the articlésays you should

you decide they’re worthy, then it’s
time for you to put some effort into
the relationship. You have to work at
it, just as with anything else.

I Finally, and most importantly,
take things slow. You don’t have to
be engaged in less than a year or
meet the parents after three dates.
Your relationship has to move at a

, pace that’s comfortable for both of

you. Don’t be afraid to look at suc-
cessful examples around you.
If you have the aforementioned

' issues — and believe me, many

people have at least one — then you
have to tackle them head-on. If you
decide that you’re not ready for a re-
lationship, period, then that’s your
choice. But for the rest of us, it’s time
to get over this crap and rehabilitate
ourselves. That’s the key to a suc-

..cessful modern relationship. __-A A,-_ . ,

Telefactcelebrates 21 years of being ‘smart’ on the phone

Written By Patrick Wagner

Before the advent of iPhones in
2007, Telefact made every phone
a “smart phone.” Instead of from
Google Maps, directions came from

’a guy with a googol of maps. In-
' 1 ‘stead of Wikipedia, page-turners

ﬂipped through the Encyclopedia

Britannica.

Since 1990, the free question-
answering service has helped both
students and nonstudents in their
quests for bus schedules, news con-
ﬁrmation and even a laugh at the
painfully accurate information the
student operators are compelled to
provide. This year, the organiza-
tion honors its 21st birthday with
a 24-hour session from Nov. 10 to
Nov. 11, celebrating its roots from
a time when information was not
immediately accessible.

u

ing Fact Line to verify information
rather than rumors.
While planning Telefact, Pitt

.student§;and staff toured the Fact

Line“facility, and even today much
of Telefact’s structure still har-
kens back to the ofﬁce on Bowling
Green’s Ohio campus.

“They even put me on the lines,” -

Giangarlo said. From there, the
Board hired then-student Pam Gen-

naula Day as Telefact’s ﬁrst coordi- ,

nator and began putting together a
command center.

“It’s crazy that one little room
can do so much,” Day said.

They stuffed a small space in the
William Pitt Union with encyclo-
pedias, maps and reference books
— particularly those with indexes
— to ensure that Telefact opera-
tors would know the right answer

The best way to get someone to dig
their heels in is to come out and say,
’We don’t need you.’ Never say that
to a group of students.
—Joyce Giangarlo

The Beginning

“Students would have to call
everywhere for information,” said
Joyce Giangarlo, now the coordina-
tor of Telefact. She was the Student
Government Board adviser when
brainstorming for the service began
in 1990. Campus leaders and the
Board met to discuss how to keep
students in the information loop,
since they lacked phonebooks like
those provided for the faculty.

“The recurring theme in those
meetings was that there wasn’t a
central source of information,” Gi-
angarlo said. “You’d have to call ﬁve
places and get put on hold before
you could learn what you needed
to know.”

Fortunately, Tom Misuraca,
assistant director of Student Life,
had the solution thanks to his time
at Bowling Green University. That

school had a system called Fact
Line, a rumor-quelling informa-
tion system instituted during the
counter—culture era of the ’70s. As
time passed, students began us-

  99

to callers’ questions.

“This was the days before the
Internet,” Day said. “So what we
gathered was all hard‘ copy.”

The ﬁrst batch of operators only
had enough room in their space for
three phones and the shelves of ref-
erencegmaterial they relied on. Still,
the call center had more immediate
infortiiation than anywhere else on

‘campus.

“We didn’t know what we were

going to be asked until we answered A

the phones,” Giangarlo said.
“ Telefact wasn’t without its de-
tractors. On the ﬁrst day of classes

in 1990, The Pitt News ran a full? : 
page “perspective” piece, show; ,’
ing that people said it was eithera 
. childish exploration or a waste of .
the Board’s money. The published '

graphic hardened the organiza-
tion’s resolve and ultimately helped
ensure that the students who ran
Telefact would be on top of their
game-, Giangarlo said.

“The best way to get someone tony

dig their heels in is to come out and
say,-‘We don’t need you,”’ Giangarlo

  

 

 sa that to a group of
~ ‘sttidetits-”"

 

' The Questions

The questions at Telefact range
from the practical to the absurd,
and often the organizationtserves
as an important resource for many
Pitt students. ﬂ

During Pennsylvania’s Aug. 23
‘tremors, ‘operator Christine Gar-

rard said that “people called and:

wondered, ‘Was that actually an
earthquake?”’ Students recently.
have asked aboutthe Casey Antho-
ny verdict and Steve Jobs’ death. i

“We ﬁnd out about [breaking
news] through the calls some-:
times,” operator Michelle lwersoni
said. When veriﬁcation was essen—i
tial, Telefact served as a source of:
truth for those too shocked to be--'

“After: 9/11‘ happened, ‘there - V

coverage,” Giangarlo said. » “But i
we received about 3,800 calls that

day. We opened-early: and manned it = .

lief even though itwas everywhere.
Students were still calling Telefact

dents use Telefact — in fact, anyone
with a phone can call.

That really does mean anyone.
Though the vast majority of the
calls concern students’ needs for
accurate information, the nature
of that necessity is ﬂexible.

“We have nonstudents who call
regularly with generally [campus-
life] related questions,” Everson
said. “There’s ‘Boca Raton guy’ who
asks questions about Boca Raton.
There’s a guy who keeps calling
with clueless technology questions.
There’s ‘high school sports’ guy who
wants to know local sports scores
— that’s not always an easy thing
to ﬁnd, either.”

But as far as outrageous ques-
tions go, these aren’t the worst of-
fenders. Everson said that at this
point, questions rarely shock her.

T “I used to work a lot of Friday af-
ternoons, and that’s when we’d get a
lot of inappropriate questions from
guys who would look something up
on Urban Dictionary and ask us to
deﬁne it,” she said.

These calls seem to occur most
often in spring, she said. Giangarlo
mentioned that during May, there
are a lot of high school trips and
these visitors also contribute to
the spike in “inappropriate ques-
tions.” .

“So we get a lot of questions
relating to deﬁnitions on Urban
Dictionary. They want to see if
they can get a reaction, but our
operators can make the most racy
things sound like the most boring.
They’ve got a lot of professional-
ism,” she said.

Though those calls might be the
most memorable to Telefact op-
erators, the service still maintains
pride in its ability to serve basic
student needs.

“We’re at about 10 percent ﬁm
questions and 90 percent serious
questions,” Giangarlo said. “That
might be about anything from oil
changes to piercing salons, but it
ultimately relates to living as a stu-
dent on campus.”

But there are some questions
Telefact can’t answer. . _ .

When now-senior Everson came
to visit Pitt at the end of high school,
her guide recommended Telefact as
a source for homework questions.

“He toldme, ‘You’re not sup-

posed to, -but if you phraseitas a -4 . »

hypothetical you can get away with
it,”’ she said.

Now an operator, Everson quick-
ly points out that answering home-
work questions is something Tele-
fact will not do because it violates

its academic integrity policy.

Twenty-one Years and a Tech
Revolution Later

Since Telefact opened, tech-
nology has changed the way peo-
ple get information. Not only do
computers allow fast searches, but
smartphones give users the ability
to access information anywhere.

Yet despite these advances, stu-

dents still use Telefact.

“Even I would have believed a lot
of technology would have put us out
of business,” Giangarlo said. “But
they haven’t impacted our numbers
that dramatically. We still get over
100,000 calls a year.”

Past a glass window and through
a heavy wooden door sits Telefact’s
command center. Four Macintosh
computers and black headsets wait
for operators to use them while the
gentle hum of computer fans and a
TV ﬁll the room sonically.

The walls are covered in the an-
swers to common questions. Hand-
written bus schedules, phone num-
bers and premade answer sheets all
hang in front of other charts and
aggregations.

Four of the 18 staff members
usually work at one time,’ social-
izing when calls don’t come in. But
when a bright chime calls them to
their stations, they put on their
headsets and respond, “Hello, this
is Telefact. How may I help you?”

Although it might lack the con-
venience of smartphones, Gian-
garlo said that talking to a person
is an important aspect of Telefact

that sets it apart from Google. _

But despite the largely unchanged na-

I ture of student needs, Telefact has tried

to keep up with the changing times by ex-
perimenting with the use of Twitter and

I holding the 24-hour session in honor of
, its birthday.

The service’s normal operating hours
of noon to 9 p.m correspond to the prime
hours a student might need help, Giangarlo’
said. Earlier hours and students might be
in class, and any later might bring more
trivial questions. However, a 24-hour cycle
would allow the center to compete in the
Information Age.

“I’ll let [Telefact]-try it out and see what

  

answer the phone at Telefact’s office.

happens,” Giangarlo said. “If [the opera-
tors] really want to be open 24 hours, we’ll
have another discussion.”

Whether it’s open nine hours or 24, Tele-
fact has transmitted accurate, up—to-date
information and remained a conﬁdent voice
on the other end of the line for 21 years.

“Just picking up the phone and talking
to a live person can make all the difference
in a person’s day,” Day noted. “It’s nice to
have a warm body on the other end.”

Through jokes and tears alike, infor-
mation remains easily available over the
phone. Any questions? Call Telefact at 412-

movementwas organized quickly,” she said.

Currently, Google Docs and Facebookare the
main forums the Occupy Pittsburgh movement
uses to organize and communicate. The group
funnels the contributions of activists through

group headed by a “bottom-liner,” and through
General Assembly meetings.

The working groups formulate proposals

opportunityfor members to place blocks on “leg-

BASKETBALL

Pitt gets win, prepares for season opener

Roger Sepich
Staff Writer

Pitt men’s basketball team’s
play Monday night resembled
returning forward Nasir Rob-
inson’s — it wasn’t pretty, but
it got thejob done.

Robinson returned from his
knee injury to play for the first
time since last year’s NCAA
Tournament in the Panthers’
76-67 victory over Division II
Kentucky Wesleyan College. “It
was a good test,” Robinson said
in a post—game press conference.
“They came out playing hard. We
didn’t execute in certain things,
so we’re going to learn from this
game and get better.”

Head coach Jamie Dixon
looked visibly frustrated with
his team’s play for much of first
half of the team’s last exhibition
game. He used two timeouts and
frequently substituted his play-
ers in and out of the game.

It was Robinson’s play that
managed to keep Pitt in the
game during its competitive first
half. He tallied six points and
four rebounds in the 10 min-
utes that he played of the game’s
initial 20.

“I felt good out there,” Rob-
inson said. “I’m not 100 percent
yet, but close to it.”

However, Robinson was un-
able to play in the second half
because of a persistent bloody
nose after he was hit with an
elbow late in the first half.

“He hit his nose yesterday
and got hit again in the game,
and it just wouldn’t stop,” Dix-
on said. “It wasn’t your typical
bloody nose, let’s put it that way.
We were concerned it might hap-
pen actually.”

On the last two possessions
of the half, Pitt senior guard
Ashton Gibbs drained back—to—
back 3-pointers to give his team
a 42-33 halftime lead. It was the
ﬁrst time Pitt had a signiﬁcant
lead in the contest.

Gibbs then carried the mo-
mentum over the break by scor-
ing the ﬁrst bucket of the second
half. From there, his team main-
tained about a 10-point lead for

the remainder of the game.

Since the game was closer
than many expected, Pitt fans
might have gotten a good idea of
what Dixon’s player rotation will
look like this season. Ten play-
ers, including redshirt fresh-
man guard Cameron Wright and
freshmen forwards Khem Birch
and Malcolm Gilbert, played
more than five minutes.

Birch led Pitt’s freshmen with
six points and added four re-
bounds. '

“He played well,” Dixon said
of Birch’s performance. “He’s

got some good instincts, and

he’s responding well to things

he’s never seen before. He seems

to be picking up some things.”
But it was the performances

of Gibbs and Lamar Patterson
that really made the difference
for Pitt.

Gibbs ﬁnished with 20 points
in 29 minutes, but even he was
outdone by Patterson. The red-
shirt sophomore played his best

game as a Panther on his way to a’

game-high 22 points to go along
with five rebounds.

“Lamar’s been playingreally
well in practice,” Dixon said.
“It’s not a big surprise. We've
been seeing that. He’s shooting,
rebounding and passing well.
He’s been one of our best all-
around guys.”

“I was hitting shots,” Pat-
terson said. “I’m trying to
show Coach I can do whatever
he needs me to do and showing

my versatility.”

Despite giving up 67 points,
Pitt’s defense still managed to
hold Kentucky Wesleyan to just
39 percent’ from the field. The
Panthers also out-rebounded
their opponents by a 40-to-29
margin. , —

Pitt doesn’t’have to wait long
before it begins its regular sea-
son. The Panthers will host the
Albany Great Danes Friday at
7 p.m. in the Petersen Events

- Center in the season opener for

both teams.

“Seventeen practices, two
games, six freshmen —- we’ve got
to get better,” Dixon said. “We’ve
got to get some things done in
these next couple days before we
go up against Albany.” g

 

A GRAIN OF SAUL

Time for
NFL mid-“‘

season
awards

Isaac Saul
Assistant Sports Editor

At the halfway point of the Ngk
season, the success and slumbers
of teams and players are begin-
ning to solidify.

The early weeks of the NFL are
usually forgotten by now, with
teams such as the Washington
Redskins —— who began the year
3-1 —— now last in their divisions
and seemingly out of the playoff
race.

As the true stars begin to
emerge, it’s time for the mid-
season award ceremony. Wigﬂ
all the haters, fantasy lovers and
Steelers fans in mind, here are

I your winners:

Most Valuable Player: Peyton
Manning, Quarterback, India-
napolis Colts

For the first time in NFL his-
tory, the Most Valuable Player
award should go to a guy who
hasn’t taken a snap all season.
Who can argue with this noimg
nation? In his first 12 seasons,
Manning led the Colts to the
playoffs 11 times. He also won a
Super Bowl. Now, after his being
sidelined with a neck injury and.
not seeing a snap this year, the
Colts are 0-9. ‘:""”

Offensive Player of the Year:
Aaron Rodgers, Quarterback,
Green Bay Packers

 In reality, Rodgers shouﬁ
probably win the Most Valuable
Player award, but this guy is an
offensive machine. It’s possible
the NFL hasn’t seen another play-
er in the last decade get as hot
as Rodgers is right now. He has”
the Packers at 8-0, is leading the‘?
league in touchdowns (20) and
is coming off a four—touchdown

was the ﬁrst commit of the recruiting class
of 2012 for Todd Graham, also converted
ﬁve extra points in the victory. The Vikings
won 69-25 and will face Brentwood in the
second round of the playoffs.

Rushel Shell — RB — Hopewell

Pitt’s prized recruit for the class of 2012
carried his team to a 41-13 victory over
Indiana. His 256-yard, four-touchdown
performance put his name in the history
books. It was his 38* consecutive 100-yard
rushing game, tying him‘ for the national

record set by Billy Sims of Hooks, Texas.-~
Sims went on to win the Heisman Memorial"
Trophy at the University of Oklahoma: The

Vikings will face Franklin Regional High
School in the next round of the WPIAL
playoffs, and Shell needs just one more
100-yard game to break Sims’ record. He
also needs just 240 more yards for the
Pennsylvania state rushing title.

Conwell will be a linebacker when he
suits up in the Blue and Gold next year,
but for now he is obtaining most of his

four sacks, and one forced fumble on the
season. - _,
Trenton Coles —— WR —- Clairton 
Coles, a 6-foot-3 receiver who has a4.4
second 40-yard sprint, is the main offen-
sive weapon for a Clairton team that’s won
41 straight games and is looking for its
third consecutive PIAA Class A Champion-
ship. Coles scored twice for the Bears in
their (54-0) defeat of Cornell, with a 5—yard
touchdown run and a 70-yard interception
return. Like Geter, -he also kicks for his
Single A powerhouse, tacking on four PATs
for the defending state champs. V
Alkwan Williams — LB —- John-
stown ~
Williams, a two-star recruit on Rivals,
turned in one of his best defensive per-
formances of the season. He led his team
to a (23-17) victory over Forest Hills (8-1).
The Trojans advance to the state playoffs
as the top-seeded team after the second

1 seed, Bellefonte, ﬁnished 1-9 and will not

participate in the playoffs. Williams had 10
tackles, two sacks and a 33-yard intercep-
tion return for a touchdown. He also ‘caught
three balls for 37 yards on offense. I

Hi haters. Bye Haters.

Joke of the Year:'lThe New England

Patriots defense

As the Patriots continue to seem less

and less superhumanand more and more

beatable, people willlpoilnt ﬁngers at Tom‘ V
Brady. Well,-those people will be wrong.
The Patriots‘ defense is“ ranked dead last’

in the NFL, allowing 416 total yards of of-

fense a game‘. It’s one thing if your offense 

can’t get off the ﬁeld, but the Pats are av-
eraging 437 yards a game on offense (thi"‘
best in the league). They’d be undefeated
if their D could hold it together.

Fantasy Let Down of the Year: Chris
Johnson, Running Back, Tennessee Ti-
tans

CJ has found the end zone once this year
and has only gone for 100 yards one time
— against the Cleveland Browns. People
remain optimistic he will turn it around,
but I’ve given up. He was my ﬁrst—round
pick. C’mon man!

Surprise of the Year: The San Fran-
cisco 49ers

After the NFC West Championship hype
last year, the 49ers started 0-5 and ﬁn-
ished 6-10. The team lost its coach and
its staff and kept a franchise running back
and a mediocre quarterback. After bring-
ing in Jim Harbaugh to lead the troops,
they’re 7-1 for the ﬁrst time since 1997
and have “Super Bowl contender” written
all over them. _’ ’

Free Agent of the Year: Terrell Owens,
Wide Receiver, Nobody

One of the onlylplayers to ever tele-
vise a workout, T.O.l couldn’t draw a single
team scout to his attempt at drawing some
interest in his rebuilt knee. He did look
' good though, and-despite his torn ACL and
troublesome personality, he did have 983

yards and nine touchdowns last season. If 1

somebody would take the chance, he could
be a nice weapon to have. C
