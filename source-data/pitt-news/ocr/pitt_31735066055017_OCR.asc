Revealing your sexuality at work

BiGaLA panel set to
share experiences

By Jennifer Alpha
Staff Writer

Katie Douglass describes her coming out at
her job last summer much like one of those
12-step programs — but not so much for her-
self as for her co-workers.

She said she rarely had to make announce-
ments to’ her co-work_ers about her sexual
preferences.

“I find that sexual orientation comes up
naturally in general conversation,” said
Douglass, the education chair for the
Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Alliance.

The reactions she got when people realized
she is a lesbian usually went through three
stages, she said. They would express disbe-
lief, then maybe embarrassment and, finally,

lots of questions.

Coming out and being out at work is the
subject of the panel discussion sponsored by
BiGaLA to be held in 207 David Lawrence at
8:30 p.m tonight. The discussion will feature
three panelists who will talk about their
experiences of being out at work. One pan-
elist is on staff at the university and the other
two come from the Pittsburgh community,
said Fred Bigelow, BiGaLA’s publicity chair.
Bigelow hopes to have an informal discus-
sion by the panel followed by a question-and-
answer session with the audience.

Bigelow said the discussion is not designed
to tell people that coming out at work is
something they must do, but rather to share,
experiences.

“We- are all in different situations, and this
is to show how different people work in dif-
ferent situations,” he said.

Bigelow,,an insurance billing clerk for a
health-care organization, said he first came

For The Pitt News

Five hundred feet of
black granite, 300 pound
sheets of lead and 43 tons
of broken car glass are
some of the atypical mate-
rials architect and sculptor
Maya Lin chooses for her
structures, and she man-
ages to make them as
monumental as the people
and eras they represent.

Lin is the designer of

the Vietnam Memorial in
Washington, D.C. She
submitted the design in
1981 while an undergrad-
uate a_t Yale University.
The V—shaped monument,
etched with the names of
58,000 veterans who died"
in Vietnam, is unforget-
table both to its observers
and to those who have
only read about’ it.
Ironically, Lin herself
does not give any thought
to this, or any, of her‘fin-
ished work.

“I forget about it the
second it’s done,” she told
her audience at the
Carnegie Music Hall.

Lin discussed her
designs and inspirations
as part of the Three Rivers
Lecture Series, Monday
night.

She said that she consid-
ers the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial to be the “most
influential” work she h_as
ever done. But, she said,
she has spent much of her

career “trying to get past
it.” 1

Initiative and the push for
improved access to the
Information Superhighway.)

America's leaders boast that
by the year 2000 the
Information Superhighway will
offer students a more diverse,
complete learning environment.
There will be class discussions
on the Internet which span the
globe. Bank transactions and
shopping will be done by com-
puter.

Thoughimproved access to
the superhighway and better
technological literacy training
for children may keep America
competitive in the world, the

issues that arise
from working
with it.

While working
on the KickStart
Initiative, Toni
Carbo Bearman,
Pitt’s dean of
SLIS, and the
other Advisory
Council mem-

 

bers posed some difficult ques-

tions about privacy, security

and intellectual property.
“There were a lot of ques-

tions raised on intellectual
property. What
is protected by
copyright? And
privacy, which
we are all very
concerned
about,” Bearman
said.

The Initiative
addresses con-
cerns about
copyrights and

. privacy by
defining them

and then providing scenarios

for discussion.
With improved access to the
Net, any person can reach

copyrighted material and copy ,

it almost instantaneously. The
council worries that if copy-
rights are not respected. owners
may be reluctant to put their
work on-line. Another key
problem is that, unlike with tra-
ditional photocopies where a
person can easily tell work has
been copied. work from the
superhighway is harder to
detect.

WASHINGTON — The
top two officials at the
super-secret National
Reconnaissance Office,
which controls the nation’s
spy satellites, were ousted
yesterday in the wake of
allegations of financial
mismanagement.

The agency built up what
members of Congress
called “a slush fund” of
more than $1 billion before
the unspent money was
traced last year. In addi-
tion, the agency also built a
lavish new headquarters in
Virginia at the cost of $310
million, provoking an earli-
er round of criticism for
giving Congress only the
briefest outline of its plans.

_WASHINGTON — Two

years after the Clinton
administration enacted a

policy of “don’t ask, don’t

the military, Pentagon doc-
uments and interviews
with service members
show that the military is
not only continuing to ask
some troops about their
sexual orientation but is
also asking their parents,
their friends and their ther-
apists.

The documents_suggest
that the administration’s
effort-to help homosexuals
in the military may instead
be harming them, leading
to formal, wide-ranging
investigations in cases that
might have been handled in
the past with little fanfare
and without punishment.

proposals to guarantee ben-

Sfogies reignifing
inferesfin the '90s

By Nate Powers
For The Pitt News

If your image of a cigar smoker
is that of an old fart with a pocket
watch, it may be time to take
another look at who’s smoking
what in the ‘90s. In the wake of
anti-smoking legislation and
increasing awareness of the con-
sequences of smoking cigarettes,
more and more individuals are
rediscovering cigars.

University of Pittsburgh stu-
dent‘Kit Mueller has not let this
resurgence go unnoticed. Mueller
states that his’ recently incorporat-
ed Churchill Cigar Club “aims to
provide a friendly and diverse
atmosphere in which cigar
acolyte and aﬁcionado alike can
come together to share the com-
mon pleasure of a fine cigar.”

Mueller explained that
although cigar smoking has been
steadily increasing within the
general population, much of the
stigma associated with cigars still
remains. He hopes that the
Churchill Cigar Club's weekly
informalsmokers will serve as a
communal safe haven and forum
in which those who enjoy cigars
can get together and discuss their
individual preferences and inter-
ests in a relaxed environment.
Although the club plans to alter-
nate the location of these weekly
Monday night gatherings in the
future, this year’s inaugural sea-
son will be holding the first few

events at The Pittsburgh Deli
Company in Shadyside.

“The Deli Company is a per-
fect establishment for these infor-
mal smokers,” Mueller said. “'Ihe
classy and comfortable setting
allows and encourages everyone
to mingle, and the available food
and drink are delicious.” Kit went
on to add that the club will soon
be expanding its services to the
18-and-older cigar community.

“We don’t want to alienate
those individuals under 21 who
equally share a taste for fine
smokes,” explained Mueller. “In
a matter of weeks, we’ll be hav-
ing these same events at estab-
lishments which welcome smok-
ers of all ages.”

For a modest cover fee, anyone
interested receives admittance, a
deluxe cigar and a complimenta-
ry cocktail at the bar. The
Churchill Club has been able to
keep prices low in its attempt to
persuade smokers of all budgets
to join in the stogie celebration.
In addition to the shared knowl-
edge of fellow cigar connois-
seurs, Mueller added that cigar
professionals from local tobacco
shops will be on hand to sell their
finer brands and answer any
questions.

“I love promoting things that I
trulyenjoy,” sighs Mueller. “If I
can help to further the acceptance
and enjoyment of cigars while
meeting new people, then I’ll be
very content.”

loophole would be to have cer-
tain licenses cover a proposed

more readily available.

“People need to understand

vague. We think it’s unconstitu-
tional. It does raise issues about

turn the Communications_

Decency Act began two days
ago. The act imposes a
$250,000 fine and up to six
years in prison for transmitting
material that can be accessed
by children and that is consid-
ered indecent.

The coalition fighting the act,
which includes Microsoft, the
American Library Association
and the Society of Professional

Internet is similar to a newspa-
per and should be covered by
the First Amendment.

suggested that, “It does raise issues against the act \

describe some violations of
policy, as well as give exam-
ples of common uses within the

According to KickStart,
providers also need to decide
whether to set up their systems
with “audit trails,” which
would capture and retain infor-
mation about on-line activities.
Providers with financial and
data-security services would
especially need the audit trails.

Increased use of the Internet
has also brought into being the
offspring of many of these
questions, questions about
adult materials found on the
Net or about the rights of
schools to monitor student e-

mail.

“There are a lot of questions

Associated Press.

“Information is the most
important resource in our soci-
ety,” Wallace said. “Its control

Nordenberg fights

for state support

Pitt’s ability to help lead Pennsylvania into the 21st century
weighs heavily upon an adequate level of state support, according
to Pitt’s Interim Chancellor Mark A. Nordenberg.

That was the message he carried to the members of the
Pennsylvania State Appropriations Committee in his testimony
about Pitt’s budget request. He told the committee that the state
can’t retain its competitive edge if it lacks a strong system of
higher education.

As Pitt celebrates its 30-year anniversary as a state-related uni-
versity, Nordenburg pointed to a number of examples which illus-
trate the school’s positive impact on Pennsylvania.

. The fact that the number of students enrolled has nearly dou-
bled in that 30-year span topped the list. In 1956, Pitt had approx-
imately 17,000 students, while more than 33,000 attend today.

Quality programs as diverse as transplantation surgery and phi-
losophy have gained national recognition, while the amount of

- sponsored research funds Pitt attracts annually has soared to near-

ly $250 million.

“The university has not accomplished these significant achieve-
ments alone. It has done so in partnership with the
Commonwealth,” said Nordenberg.

He also warned that Pennsylvania’s support for higher learning
lags signiﬁcantly behind the levels received in most other states,
resulting in the state’s low ranking in terms of per-capita support.

“We have endeavoredto do more with less, and we have a
good measure of success. We are, however, rapidlyreaching our
limit,” Nordenberg said. ~ »

The govemor’s recommended budget for next ﬁscal year marks
the sixth sucessful year in which the proposed budget recom-

mends no increase for Pitt in the state’s base appropriation.

general, which he said is
actually the hardest part.
Bigelow said the process
was a natural one. He didn’t
need to make announcements
or send memos. He just
stopped hiding it. When he
moved to a new job in
September, Bigelow said
coming out was easier
because of the experiences
he had at his former job.

my work environment,” she
said.

Douglass said many are
afraid to come out at work
for fear of losing their jobs
or getting harassment from
co-workers. Some cities,
she said, like Pittsburgh,
have ordinances against sex-
ual discrimination, but not
all offer this protection.
There is also the decision to
engage in a legal battle,
should you lose your job
after coming out.

“He set a precedent for
other workers that my sexual
orientation was something to
be accepted,” she said.

Douglass thinks a lot of
the surprise she encountered
from her coming out at work
was because people don’t
expect such openness face to
face.

One day when a cook
made a homophobic com-
ment, Douglass said she
bluntly told the cook, “I’m a
lesbian.”

Bigelow stresses that

“No you’re not,”

Considering the possible
consequences, many may
question whether or not
coming out at work is worth
it, she said.

Douglass said she has had
only good experiences with
coming out at work. What
helps is having a supportive
employer, as she did last
year at her summer waitress-
ing job.

“Anything discussed
was something that could be
worked through,” she said.

Douglass said that coming
out at work did label her to a
degree but that this labeling
wasn’t altogether negative.

“People were able to put a
face to the label and dispell
some misconceptions,” she
said. “That’s what you are
trying to do when you come

Battle of the breweries

Well, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms must have
gotten bored, or it needed something to feel important about. So it

~ found its champion cause in attacking microbrewed beers for label-

ing techniques.

The ATF isn’t alone in its quest. Larger breweries like Anheuser
Busch are prodding the attack along, claiming that smaller brew-
eries misrepresent their products by claiming they are. made in
small towns by small brewers. In fact, many of the “smaller” labels
are contracted by the parent company to a larger brewery. About 90
percent of Sam Adams, for instance, is made at the Pittsburgh
Brewing Company instead of in Boston. Red Dog marketers dis-
guised their Miller heritage with the tag “Plank Road Brewery,”
and a lot of other “micro” beers have their homes in larger brew-
erres.

The point behind the labeling controversy is that larger brewers
are trying to capitalize on what is a growing trend. Microbeers are
“in” right now, and the real microbrewers (who use traditional
brewing methods) are mad. And the larger brewers are trying to
drive small business out of the beer industry.

What a lot of people are apparently neglecting to realize is that
very few people read the labels on their beer unless they are really
bored. No one is going to confuse Iron City for Sam Adams Lager
if they even taste the foam on the top of the glass. And it really
doesn’t matter if a beer is made in historical Boston or plain old
Pittsburgh, as long as the taste is good. The labels don’t matter, and
this extra regulation on the beer world is nothing but an industrial
war tactic.

"O" no, please don't go

i The “O”, the Original Hot Dog Shop, is trying to move south.
Not too far south, only as far as Carson Street in the South Side.
Businesses already existing in the area have blocked the move,
though, since they claim that the restaurant will be a nuisance bar.

Opponents of the move claim that the restaurant will attract
gangs and hoodlums to their neighborhood and will create a prob-
lem withtraffrc and parking. Using a slick (and underhanded) legal
technique hidden in zoning codes, opponents blocked the opening
until the “O” owner can provide a parking lot for at least 14 cars.
Where the lot is to be put was not mentioned.

While the move to the South Side does not necessarily mean the
Oakland restaurant will close, there are rumors of that kind ﬂoating
around. Those who oppose the move really don’t have the right to
keep the restaurant out, but if the rumors of leaving Oakland are
true, we would rather have the restaurant here. The “O” is an
Oakland tradition, and the place is always packed. The restaurant
has a ready-made audience of 30,000 or so people, so it would be
bad business to close the place in an area like Oakland.

The “O” should be able to open in the South Side if the owner
wants to, but, either way, it shouldn’t leave Oakland..

Memory can become paralyzing

Everyone knows that when a
person is involved in a tragic
accident, physical paralysis, to
some degree, is not uncommon.
Yet, mental and emotional paral-
ysis can also do much damage.
This may sound bizarre at first:
How can someone be emotional-
ly paralyzed? The answer, I
think, is made evident upon cri-
tiquing two groups in America:
blacks and Jews. On examina-
tion, both groups (there are
always exceptions to the rule,
but it’s true enough to make a“
generalization) are suffering
from a paralysis of memory.

Throughout history, anti-
Semitism has been directed
against Judaism and its values.
That is why Jews have long spo-
ken of those who have been
killed by anti-Semitism as hav-
ing died al kiddush ‘ha-Shem ——
to sanctify God’s name. Until the
Enlightenment, the societies
Jews lived in were primarily reli-
gious ones: Christian or Muslim."
Thus, anti-Semitism focused on
the Jewish concepts of God and
law. For the past 200 years, with
the breakdown of religion (when
nationalism became the domi-
nant value in the Western and
Arab worlds) anti-Semitism has
focused on the Jews’ people-
hood and nationhood. This is the
reason why Jew-haters often
claim they are anti-Zionists.

With regard toreligious anti-
Semitism, Jews were traditional-
ly the victims of Christian and
Muslim hatred (although intel-
lectual honesty demands the
recognition that religious
Muslim anti-Semitism, in con-
trast with the Muslim and Arab
worlds today, was not as destruc-
tive as Christian anti-Semitism).
From the Crusades, the
Inquisition and Christian-
inspired pogroms to epitaphs
such as “Christ-killer” and the
blood-libel, in which Jews were
accused of drinking non-Jewish
blood in a religious ritual, Jews
have not fared well under
Christian rule. This is particular-
ly ironic in light of the fact that
the Jews were the first nation ,to

Michael

Braitman

outlaw human sacrifice (Genesis
22, Deuteronomy 18:10) and the
only people in the ancient Near
East to prohibit the consumption
of any— — human and animal —
blood (Leviticus 3:17, 7:26,
17:10-14; Deuteronomy 12:16,
12:23-25). Thus, it is under-
standable that Jews have gener-
ally not felt comfortable under
Christian authority.

However, America is not the
same as Europe. American
Christianity has been one of the
most tolerant faiths in the history
of the world. Many Jewish
groups will ignore salute-to-
lsrael rallies because they are
held under the auspices of
Christian fundamentalists. Jews
will mortgage their homes to
send their children to study
under anti-Israel professors at
elite universities, and they will
continue to support institutions
such as Columbia University
despite the virtual absence of
administrative or faculty con-
demnation of a Der Stuermer—
like article by a black student in
the campus newspaper. Yet,
these same Jews will boycott
loving endeavors by conserva-
tive Christians who have never
voiced a single anti-Jewish or
anti-Israel sentiment.

This medieval attitude of
many Jews is also exacerbated
by the fact that (and honesty
demands this be stated) the rea-
son many Jews want to label
leaders such as Pat Robertson an
anti-Semite is that he is the
leader of a movement that is
gradually eroding post—l965 lib-
eralism, the religion of most
American Jews.

This attitude of most
American Jews toward
Christians is a mirror image of
most American blacks’ attitude
toward whites: a paralysis of
memory. Most blacks do not
want to acknowledge that most
whites have changed. For exam-
ple, one of the leaders of the

NAACP said that there is no dif-

_ference between American

racism today and when the
NAACP was founded in the ﬁrst
decade of the 20th century. This
is quite similar to many Jews’
refusal to acknowledge the pro-

found change in most Christians, »

especially in America. Of
course, racism still exists. This
does not mean, however, that
America is racist. To say that
America is racist is as racist as
saying that all blacks are stupid:
It’s equally disgusting and equal-
ly stupid.

Notonly is it not true that
most whites are racist, but there
is an additional price paid for the
mantra of “America is racist.”
Just as a child will begin to think
that he/she is stupid or ugly if
told enough times, I fear that
good people, who are not black,
if bashed enough times into their
heads that they are racist, will
begin to say, “Fine, I’ll be
racist.” The evolution from the
Weimar Republic to Nazi
Germany provides a lucid exam-

ple. Germany had one of the ,

most dynamic and free societies
on earth after World War I. It
dissolved into a sort of anarchy.
brought upon by the Left in large
part, and then the Right said.
“The only way to solve this is
with fascism."

Therein lays thedilemma: if
good people do not speak the
truth, bad people will be left
with the task. When David Duke

ran for public office in_

Louisiana. one of the reasons he
got the votes that he did (it also
must be remembered that his
opponent ran on the campaign
slogan of, “Hold your nose and
vote for me” — not an ideal can-
didate) was because he tapped
into very deep feelings of a lot of
Americans regarding welfare.
This was also the case regarding
the Million Man March. The
messages of taking care of a
family, being a decent citizen.
etc., are all ideas that were stated
by black conservatives such as
Clarence ' Thomas. Thomas

Sowell, Shelby Steele, Larry Elder, etc.
However. they are dismissed as “unauthen—
tic blacks.” As a result, who is left to carry
the message? Louis Farrakhan. When
decent people do not criticize difficult
issues, it will be left to the far Left and
Right. .

American blacks have historically been
the victims of racism. While this is true to
some extent today, if we carmot acknowl-
edge when a group is penitent, all hope is
lost. This does not mean forgiving and for-
getting the past As a serious Jew, I am pro-
hibited by Jewish law from forgiving the
Nazis. I do not forgive, and I will not for-
get. But it is also a basic Jewish principle
not to punish the children for the sins of the
parents (Deuteronomy 24:1-6). Germans
today are not the same people who gassed
Jews. So, too, regarding whites. Yes,
whites have historically been racist. But
this is not true for the vast majority of
whites today. People are to be judged on an
individual basis, not according to the sins
of their ancestors.

Shelby Steele, author of the acclaimed
book “The Content of Our Character,”
relates a story that sheds light on this sub-
ject. When he was buying a newspaper in
an airport, the woman at the counter, who
was white, had a particularly thick
Southern accent. At this point he found
himself remembering the Old South simply
because of a Southern accent. “If she was
anything less than gracious to me as the
lone black in line, I knew my defenses
would come alive  If she put my change
on the counter rather than in my hand, I’d
have all the evidence I needed to close the
case against her and the New Southto
boot”

Steele continues, “I could condemn this
woman, or at least be willing to condemn
her and her region, not because of her
racial beliefs, which I didn’t know, but
because her accent had“ suddenly made her
accountable to my voluminous and vivid
memory of a racist South. Because of this
accent and my Northern lack of familiarity
with it, I was not encountering the woman
so much as my own memory of an
extremely powerful and dreaded enemy --
the Old South.” Because of Steele’s memo-
ry, he was prevented from seeing an
innocuous gesture as simply that '—
innocuous. However, he concludes this
chapter with a very difficult and mature
statement: “It doesn’t really matter what
Southern accents in Southem airports make
me remember. What’s important is that I
can travel.” ,

It is time to do what is not human nature:
to be aware and not forget the past, but not
to let it paralyze you from seeing changes.
The manner in which many Jews depict the
Christian Coalition —— as some monolith,
marching in lockstep like some fascist band
— is disgusting, un-American and wrong.
That, to me, is more frightening than the
Christian Right. Likewise, with regard to
many blacks (and white liberals, I might
add), there is a continuing depiction of this
country as racist. The reason I add “white

' liberals” to the list is because they too have

declared America racist. One need only
look at the ACLU’s war on the entire
police force after the Rodney King beating,
in which it took out a full-page ad in the
Los Angeles Times that read as follows:
“Who do you call when the gang wears
blue?” It was not condemning a few police-
men; rather, it was the whole department.
Yes, if we forget the past, we are doomed

_ to repeat it. If we learn the wrong lessons

from history, however, we are certainly
doomed. ’

Michael Braitman is an extmverted person

Politicians haven't learned when to quit  

Knowing when to quit is a skill which
has always eluded politicians. In recent
years, for example, we have seen Jimmy
Carter and George Bush sabotage both
their credibility and their causes by run-
ning for re—election when they should
have stepped aside.

Unfortunately, it appears we are
doomed to see this repeated yet again.
An unpopular, unelectable president has
announced to run for an office he no
longer deserves. In doing so, he risks
unleashing havoc upon a nation already
embroiled in an intricate array of prob-
lems.

The president of whom I speak is not
Bill Clinton. No, our commander in chief
has once again exhibited the resiliency
and adaptability which earned him the
twin monikers of “Comeback Kid” and
“Slick Willie.” In fact, he has emerged as
a productive, competent president from
the wreckage of his early bumbling.

On. the other hand, Boris Yeltsin has
become mired in political quicksand
from which he will not emerge. The pres-
ident of the Russian Federation has seen

his credibility sink to unthinkable levels;

with him, he is dragging the reforms he
once championed.

The recent Russian parliamentary elec-
tions were a rude awakening to those
who thought that the Communists were
gone forever. The Communist Party, led
by Gennady Zyuganov, surged to 22 per-
cent of the vote. Our Home is Russia, the
pro-Yeltsin reformist party, claimed only
9.6 percent. Even ultra-nationalist
Vladimir Zhirinovsky (who makes Pat
Buchanan look like a nice, thoughtful fel-
low) led his Liberal Democrats to 11 per-
cent.

What does this mean? The Russian
presidential elections, scheduled for June,
are a two-phase affair; the top two ﬁnish-
ers from the first ballot face off on a sec-

ond ballot. If results were to mirror those.

Greg Marchand

of the December parliamentary elections,
the run-off would pit Zhirinovsky against
Zyuganov, a holy fool versus a commu-
nist.

This sort of result (which is entirely
possible) would bring about the collapse
of everything Yeltsin seemed to represent
only five years ago. During his reign,
there have been major steps forward in
Russia’s transition to a market economy.
However, the move has brought with it
the serious human costs of economic
“shock treatment.”

Whether or not the reforms can be
called “successful” at this point, it is clear
that they have been highly corrupt. The
movement of public assets into private
hands has made a few people rich while
society suffered. This has given reform a
bad name among the disenchanted work-
ing class, who have seen their savings,
pensions andsalaries wiped out.

Thus, Yeltsin attained considerable
opposition from those harmed by the
market transition. But he could still claim
a decent base of support until 1994, when
he sent the Russian army to subdue the
rebellious republic of Chechnya. Yeltsin
has now lost the support of the liberal

‘elite, who decry the expense and loss of
life from the disastrous military interven- ,

tron.

Yeltsin has moved further and further
away from his reformist positions. He
has removed the pro-reforrnists among
his cabinet in a search for economic

scapegoats. He fired the head of Russia’s

state television statement, claiming that
his administration was being portrayed in
an overly negative light. As part of a
newly assertive foreign policy (with sig-
niﬁcant nationalistic concessions), he has
appointed a former head of the KGB as
foreign policy minister. His health has
deteriorated as well; when paired with his

Voicing their opinions...

About two years ago, I was actively
involved in the Allocations Committee of
the Student Government Board. I now
will publicly relate a number of concerns
which I have with respect to the operation
and professionalism of this committee.
The first thing which sticks out in my
mind was the initial training we received
as Allocations Committee members at the
armual SGB retreat. During our training,
which was led predominantly by the
chairperson at the time, we were
informed about certain “hints” to follow
when making decisions about whether a
budget request should be approved or
denied. What is of interest here is that she
gave us very clear instructions not to
repeat these “hints” to the student groups
when they ﬁll out requests.

Hence, although these “hints” were
precisely what we used to make decisions

(things which at the time were NOT-

printed in the allocations manual), we
were given clear instructions that they
should not be told to student groups. I
have noticed some improvements in the
manual since then, although I am still
unsure as to whether there are any other
“hints” which the current committee fol-
lows and chooses not to publish. My
advice to the committee here is that if
there are any “hints,” they either should
not be used or should be published.
Another problem I noted when I ﬁrst
participated in the committee was its lack
of professionalism when conducting
meetings. This occurred during the time
when I was ﬁrst exposed to the commit-
tee and was working under “c rson

l,” who happened to be the same one
who told us not to tell the groups about
the “hints.” Speciﬁcally, I was shocked at
the way decisions were made during our
meetings. Despite the “objective” criteria
which the manual so eloquently iternizes,
during our meetings the committee just
looked at the request and assessed how
“good it look .”

Last, but certainly not least, we arrive
to a controversy which I was a part of,
which directly relates to the current com-
puter funding controversy -—— an SGB
retreat for which then-President Jacob
Brody requested $10,000. The board at
the time, like -the current board, chose to
follow the allocations process and
requested the money for its armual retreat.
It was submitted, our allocations process
denied the request, it was resubmitted,
our allocations committee again denied
the request and the board took the retreat
anyway. Sounds familiar, doesn’t it?
Substitute “computers” for “retreat” and
you have the cunent scenario!

The difference between the two situa-
tions is that unlike President Brody,
President Wuertele did submit the request
during the academic year, when the
Allocations Committee was in full opera-
tion. President Brody submitted the
request right at the end of the Allocations
Cornrnittee’s calendar year, so that “chair-
person 2” had to fight this without the
assistance of other committee members.
The administration felt it appropriate to
deﬁne the Allocations .Comrnittee’s role

in an “advisory” sense: It only advises the

SGB, and the board has the ﬁnal say. The

penchant for overindulging in alcohol,
his ability to withstand the rigors of an
election or public life is questionable.
Desperate to remain in power, he is now
a political liability to the reform move-
ment.

Despite having betrayed his reformist
background, Yeltsin still clings to the
label and the foreign support it brings.
The United States and Germany continue
to bestow their monetary blessings upon
Yeltsin, although it is clear that both
would have preferred if he had stepped
aside in the upcoming elections.
Recently, they helped speed through an
International Monetary Fund loan to
Russia of $10.2 billion, money critical to
Yeltsin’s re—election chances. By support-
ing Yeltsin, however, they risk alienating
other candidates whose trust they may
someday need to cultivate.

Yeltsin’s last stand rests upon his abili-
ty to dish out money. By partially co-opt-
ing the Communist programs of social
spending and a greater government role,
he intends to buy votes for the June elec-
tions, where he hopes to withstand a run-
off with Zyuganov. However, by doing
so he further weakens his base among
reformers, who have increasingly turned
to Yabloko party candidate Grigory
Yavlinksy.

In a recent poll, Yeltsin was supported
by 5.5 percent of the electorate, as com-
pared to 11.3 percent for Zyuganov and
7.1 percent for Yavlinksi and
Zhirinovsky. His betrayal of the reform
movement has diluted the reformist vote
to the benefit of communists and nation-
alists, leaving Russia poised to take a sig-
nificant step backwards in June. By
accepting the reality of his situation,
Yeltsin could have saved the movement
which made him a hero. Instead, he is
forsaking everything he once believed in.

Pitt News.

reason, I presumed, was because there
may be extenuating circumstances which
warrant a student group getting funding,
but they can’t get it if the Allocations
Committee follows the guidelines —
these situations may happen occasionally.

While I agree with the process with
respect to that point, I do NOT support
the fact that the board can approve its
own requests — in that context, and with
respect to SGB funding requests. In fact,
the SGB should save some time and just
automatically approve the requests itself.
I had presented this view to the adminis-
tration, and it again maintained its posi-
tion that the Allocations Committee is
merely an advisor. I then suggested that a
“special procedure” be set up for SGB
funding requests, and that was all I could
do.

In business there is a concept called the
“learning experience curve” effect, which

- basically states that in certain businesses

or industries, experience is vital for con-
tinued success in that area. This concept
also applies to the SGB. I would think
that, year after year, the SGB would con-
tinually improve, as a result of culminat-
ed experience. Although the students
change year after year, the advisors
remain. They should be on a continual
mission of improvement and should be
learning from previous incidents (espe-
cially negative ones).

I am available to answer any questions
about these incidents or about the alloca-
tions process and its ﬂaws — write me.

No. 14 and Boston College is
25th in the country.

The Big East also boasts the

No conference can compete with

Towson gets by Panther gymnasts

By Nichole Gantshar
Staﬂ Writer

The Towson State Tigers nipped Pitt’s gym-
nasts 192.5 to 188.375 despite ﬁeshman Janet
Highhill’s tie with a score on the uneven paral-
lel bars that had previously stood for 15 years.

Highhill claimed second place on the bars
with a 9.8. The score tied former Lady
Panther Lisa Shirk’s mark set in 1981. Shirk
went on the next year to win the NCAA
championship.

Also on the bars, senior Brenda Stevens
spun .015 away from ﬁnishing third. She had
updated her routine to include a new release.
Once she becomes more comfortable with the
routine, she will be able to earn higher scores

do two.”

Returning to competition, senior
Michaelene Myers ﬁnished eighth, earning
only 9.225. The low score was a result of hav-
ing been out of the rotation for two weeks and
a fall during a tumbling move across the
beam’s four—inch surface.

Also affecting the team’s total score was a
disappointing showing on the vault and ﬂoor.

Floor leaders Stevens and Calli Bodnar
failed to turn in programs that equalled previ-
ous meets’ perforrnances, which earned 9.8.
The judges awarded Stevens 9.5 and Bodnar a
9.4.

“I left them to speak together after the
event,” said Yohman.

One of the team captains Brenda Stevens
spoke to the team.

“Of my four years with the team, this team
is the most talented, has the most potential and
can easily score 190,” Stevens told her team-
mates. “If we all work together and everyone
hits on each event, we can do it We only need
the conﬁdence.” Other team members agree.

“It’s not an individual sport. It’s a team
sport,” said Buck. “We have to worry about
our performance ﬁrst before we can beat any-
body.”

Pitt has only six more opportunities left in
the season to break the elusive mark, with its
next chance on March 2 at the North Carolina

the highlight of the event was. Highhill’s rou-
t1r1e.

“The bars for a long time has been a weak‘
event,” said Head Coach Debbie Yohman. “I
had told everyone that this was one thing that
would happen this year.”

The record made up for a fall by usually
consistent Lori Buck from the bars. To exe-
cute the release move on which she fell, buck

“She went straight up and down and down
again,” said Yohman. “Her ﬂight wasn’t

But Buck came back on the balance beam.

“I wanted to ﬁnish on a positive note,” said
Buck. “So I wanted to attack the routine and

Penn State finishes
Pitt hockey's year, 6-0

Connie Nigro

Graduating seniors Steve Fisher and Ken Anderson took to the ice for
Pitt in what would be the ﬁnal hockey game of their college career
Saturday as Penn State shut out the Panthers 6-0 in the serni-ﬁnal round
of the Championship Tournament held at IUP.

Pitt went into the playoffs as the second-place team in the West

the serr_1i—ﬁnal round against Penn State.
Pitt fell behind Penn State 2-0 after two periods of play. Considering
that Pitt lost to Penn State eariier in the season 8-2, a two-goal deﬁcit

wanted them to be.

“We were in striking distance to win the game,” White said.

The Panthers knew there was still hope to come back against Penn
State. After all, they came back from a two-goal deﬁcit against Slippery
Rock the night before. ' K

“We were ﬁred up coming out of the locker room. It just went ﬂat,”
Fisher said

The ﬂow of the third period was changed when Pitt’s Travis Wﬂls was
hit behind the net when he't:ried to duck out of a check His head was
caught between the boards and the guy who hit him.

“It changed the whole perspective of the game,” White said. “He had
to be carried off of the ice and taken to the hospital.”

As it turned out, Wills was not seriously hurt and recovered, but the
Panthers never did Penn State added four more goals in the third period
before it was all said and done.

“We were outplayed by a better team with more depth,” Rizzo said

Maybe the Panthers were outplayed, but they faced back-to-back
games, whereas Penn Statehad a week oﬂ to rest.

If the performances of the
men’s and women’s.track and
ﬁeld teams last weekend served
as any indication of how they will
do at the upcoming IC4A and
ECAC Championships, then
things certainly look good for
Steve Lewis and Co.

The Panthers competed in. the

Wilson Invitational in Notre‘

Dame on Saturday and the 1996
Mobil Invitational at George
Mason University on Sunday.
Lewis only sent a few athletes to
the Wilson Invitational with the
goal of qualifying a few more
runners for the IC4As and
ECACS and the‘ NCAA
Championships to be held in two
weeks. Trecia Smith accom-
plished this goal by capturing
ﬁrst in the triple jump to qualify
for the NCAAS. Jay Murphy took
second in the 55-meter hurdles
yet barely missed qualifying.
While the goal in the Wilson
Invitational was mostly business,
the objective for the Mobil
Invitational, in Coach Lewis’
words, was: “A matter of partici-
pating and running in a few
events we don't nonnally run in.

It’s a lot of fun. We have a chance
to see and compete against some
of the elite athletes of the world,
and our performances were good
to carry us into this weeken ”

An example of this would be in
the women’s high jump, where
Najuma Fletcher and UCLA's
A-my Acuff, the runner—up and
champion of last year’s outdoor
NCAA Championships respec-
tively, competed against world-
class competition. Acuff took
seventh, while Fletcher managed
an eighth-place ﬁnish.

One performance in particular
that warranted attention was that
of senior Jay Jones, who “had his
best performance of the year,”
according to Lewis, blazing to a
third—place ﬁnish in the 55-meter
dash with time of 6.33 seconds.

Jones also led oﬂ‘ the 200-meter ,
relay team that took fourth place __
with a time of 1:29.64. Also

included in the relay were Tim
Tyre, Curtis Anderson and Oriel
Green.

-The men’s distance medley

Thomas, Scott Gilpin and Ed
Adarnson also performed well,
taking ﬁfth place.

Tennis trio leads youth movement

  : By Paul Kogut
V . Staff Writer

The hypothesis is this: A youth
movement is in full swing on the
women’s tennis team.

The evidence: Pitt’s No. 1 seed is a
19-year-old sophomore. The No. 2
and No. 6 seeds are 18-year-old fresh-

_ men.

Conclusion: these young women

  are “the future of the team.”

In that case, the future of the team,

 much like the present, looks like a

The successes of Fran Davis (the
tearn’s ace), Erin Shalbrack (No. 2)
and Jen Bible (No. 6) have been a key
to the Panthers’ 6-2 start in team play
and strong showings at four non-team
tournaments.

The trio provide depth to a team
which also starts three “very good”
seniors and a junior, Coach George
Dieffenbach said. Because of that,
they have given the team hope of end-
ing Pitt’s string of last place ﬁnishes at

the Big East Championship -—— every
tennis season’s ﬁnale.

‘The freshmen that have come in
have contributed a great deal,” senior
member Marla Zielinski said. “With
the new freshmen, I think we have a
good chance of pulling out of last
place and into seventh or eighth.”

But even if the team doesn’t, Davis,
Shalbrack and Bible have already left
their marks.

This year, Davis moved up from
the No. 2 slot to No. 1 and has
notched an 8-7 mark in singles com-
petition. As No. 1, she matches up
against the best player from each
opposing school. _

Davis plays what tennis aﬁcianados
call an “all-court game.” She can stay
back and hit hard ground strokes from
the baseline. She can move close to
the net and ﬁnesse her opponent. And
her serve is usually strong.

Still, there is always room for
improvement.

Dieffenbach said: “Her overall
energy and intensity is a key factor in
a game. When her intensity is up, she

is much more effective as a player out
there. She needs to focus on that”

Davis’ intensity was high when she
came within a few good serves of
beating one of the top 60 women’s
tennis players in the nation (Santi
Nalluri of Youngstown State) at the
Pitt Invitational on Feb. 18.

Dieffenbach agreed. “Yes, her
intensity was up nice and high against
Nalluri,” he said .

The ﬁnal score was 7-6 (13-11), 2-
6, 6-4.

Shalbrack is tied with senior Alison
Baker for second place on the team
with seven wins in singles matches.
This is all the more impressive when
Shalbrack’s knee injury, a dislocation,
is considered.

Shalbrack sustained the knee injury
in basketball practice during her
senior year at Upper Dublin High
School in Philadelphia.

Also during her senior year, she
was ranked No. 24 among women’s
tennis players who were 18 years old
or younger and lived in the region
covering Pennsylvania, Delaware and
parts of New Jersey and West
Virginia.

At times, the injury hampers
Shalbrack’s preferred style of play,
that of an attacker. But she makes
adjustments.

Dieffenbach explained: ‘There is
more stress on your knee if you are
moving forward, attacking. She’s
had to temper that style of play this
year. She’s had to hit more ground
strokes” from the baseline.

It should be interesting to see how
well Shalbrack fares after she recov-
ers fully from her injury, which may
be as early as July.

She will undergo arthroscopic knee
surgery in late April.

“I’m going to tough it out for the
rest of the season,” Shalbrack said.
“I think the rehab shouldn’t be

 longer than a month and a half, two

months.

“I’ll be ready for the season in
September.”

Jen Bib1e’s style is Shalbrack’s style
in negative; Bible prefers to pound
at heropponents from the baseline
and shies away from the net. It has
worked well for Bible so far. She is

wins with eight. She has four losses.

Yet Bible would like to get more
comfortable playing close to the net

“I have to work on my serve,” she
said. “It gave me a little trouble at
the Pitt Invitational.”

Dieffenbach recruited Bible from
Beaver Area High School in Beaver,
Pa. There, as a senior, she was
ranked No. 30-in the same region in
which Shalbrack was ranked.

All three —— Davis, Shalbrack and
Bible —- are thrilledwith their suc-
cess, obviously, but they have
remained humble. No trash-talking
on the court here. And they appreci-
ate having the veterans around.

“I think this season we’re going to

Shalbrack said “It was great having

Crew rows South for Spring Break

By Nichole Gantshar
Staff Writer

Pitt Crew leaves for Florida on Friday for spring break
A great week in the sun on the water? Sure, but coaches
leave on Thursday with the rowing shells in tow.

It will be the crew’s first time in the water since
November, because the Three Rivers Rowing Association
Safety Committee will not let crews back on the water
until after March 8.

“Right now we have all these ice shams, and the rivers
are moving just too fast,” said club Vice-President
Suzannah Land. “Two years ago we didn’t get onto the
water until rnid-April, and of course our training suffers.”

Yet, under a new women’s coach, Greg Egnor, training
has been relentless.

“Sometimes you ﬁnd the winter schools dominate the
summer schools because we have such intense winter
training,” said Land. _

Until they reach Tampa Bay, the crew is staying in
shape by using rowing machines (ergometers), nrnning
the stadium stairs and weight training.

“We erg ﬁve to six times a week,” said Land “Greg has
radically changed our training program.”

Egnor, who rowed at the University of Rhode Island
and coached at Wichita State, started with the team in
rnid-January.

“.He’s changed our focus ﬁom primarily a lightweight
team to be more competitive in the heavyweight competi-

tions,” said Land. “We are going to have a [women’s]
heavyweight eight.” Heavyweight races are crew’s pre-
mier event.

Thirty novice team members will also accompany the
varsity crew.

“A lot of them have not picked up an oar before,” said
Land. “It will be novice day camp. They will learn a lot,
and every stroke in the water counts.”

The women’s team will train three times a day, practic-
ing at 6:00 a.m., a break from the earlier times in
Pittsburgh. '

“Once we get there, we have double practices,” said
Conrad. “We usually have a run [a mock race] in between
and a second practice at 3:00.”

Last year the team travelled to Florida to compete in the
President’s Cup.

“We had planned to do this again this year,but spring
break was too early,” said Land. “Instead we will have
match races for two days, [but] there won’t be any
medals.”

Crews from Colgate, Michigan, Simmons, University
of Tampa and Columbia universities will be there to pro-
vide the competition.

Columbia’s crew will also bring along a gift, a new
shell. The new acquisition will ﬁnally replace the boat that
was destroyed in last year’s accident and demonstrates the
broad depth of the crew’s alumni support

“It’s the boat the national team used a few years back,”
said Land. “So it’s a good boat.”

Assistant Coach Mary Allison
Williams, who competed in the
55-meter hurdles and ran the
fastest American women’s time
this year.
As would be expected, Lewis
is excited about the IC4A and
the ECAC championships tobe
held in Boston this weekend.
“Our expectations are pretty high
going into this weekend.”
The Championships will be
held at Harvard for the men,
while the women’s team will
compete at Boston University.
The meet will feature all of the
teams in the Big East, along with

the east —— close to 100 men’s
and women’s teams in all. ’
Lewis expects his team to do

Anthony Dorsett and Jay Jones
both will compete in the 55-
meter dash, while Jay Murphy
and Jay Jones should both be in
the hunt for individual titles in
the 55—meter hurdles and the 200
meters, respectively.
‘On the women’s team,
Fletcher is expected to contend
for ﬁrst-place ﬁnishes in the pen-
tathlon, triple jump and high
jump. Trecia Smith should place
high in the long jump, pentathlon
and high jump, while Angie
Martin will compete in the 1,000
meters.
Lewis feels that both the
men’s and women’s teams will
be able to improve their overall
performances from the Big East
Championships. Although the
team lacks the depth that other
schools possess, it more_than
makes up for it in quality.

. “By the third period, we were tired,”
Fisher said. “Towards the end it affect-
ed us.”

Pitt goalie Pat Kenney said that
before the game in the locker room on
Saturday, everyone was complaining of
soreness.

“We thought we’d slip past Slippery
Rock, but it was a tough game,”
Kenney said. “We came into the Penn
State game with the wrong attitude. We
made all the mistakes’ instead of them,
and they got all the bounces.”

Kenney was an observer for the Penn
State game as Jeff Haduch played in
net. .

“Jeff played a great game,” Kenney
said. “He stopped people on the
doorstep and on breakaways.”

Although Pitt didn’t retain its
championship title, it still had one .

Leonards. Leonards gave Rizzo a pass
in the slot, and Rizzo quickly buried the
puck, giving Pitt a 4-2 lead

Fisher sealed the victory for the
Panthers as he scored with just 3:29 left
in regulation.

“I picked it up in our own end and
avoided a guy,” Fisher said. “I went
down, the right_ wing and faked outside,
then cut inside and went through the
defenseman. I scored on the forehand
through the ﬁveho1e.” _ .

Although Pitt’s season ended in
defeat, it wasn’t all in vain.

“We had a good season,” Rizzo said
“It’s disappointing, but I can’t say we
played bad The season was a success.”

Ewing takes it to the young Wallace early, scoring 10 points
in the ﬁrst ﬁve minutes, all on assists from “The Fear .”
However, Blount goes in to spell Wallace and accidentally
undercuts Ewing, injuring a third knee that Ewing was
unaware of having.

VV1th the All-Tirne Big East squad up 19-4 eight minutes
into the game, UConn’s Allen responded. He hit consecutive
3-pointers to cut the lead to 19- 10. Life was breathed into the
awed youngsters.

The o1d—tirners were in for a war, an epic contest ‘on scale
with the battle of Gettysburg.

Blount got involved with solid defense on Mourning, who
was forced to play the rest of the game due to Ewing’s injury.

Blount surprised the Big East’s all—time leading shot blocker
with his array of inside moves. By the end of the half, Blount
had scored 12 points, and the 1995-96 team led 54-49.

For the half, Blount led the youngsters with 12 points .and

nine points. lverson went 0-for-13 from the ﬁeld.

The old-timers were led by Beny and Marshall, who each
scored 11 points. Washington dished out 14 assists.

The second half showcased some of the most picturesque
hoops ever played. .

With 13:03 remaining, Smith grabbed a board and dribbled
out of trouble. Reaching the time line, Smith saw an open
hoop and took off. He soared through the air with the grace of
Lyrm Swarm and the power of Cory Everson. He dunked it

Just as in the Penn State game, Pitt
was down 2-0 at the end of the ﬁrst.

“They jumped on us early,” Rizzo
said. “We weren’t ready, and they
outplayed us.”

Kermey, who was in net that night,
said the one thing he thought to him-
self was: “Please, God, don’t let me
let anymore shots in.”

Rizzo’s goal with just 49 seconds
left in the second period gave
Kenney some breathing room.
Rizzo’s goal came on a pass by
Carter Leonards out of the defensive

Chris Bickell scored 4:35 into the

Bickell’s goal was unassisted as he
blocked a shot and skated around the '
