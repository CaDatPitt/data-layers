BAS rallies for Black Cultural Cente

By Suzann Gries
Staﬂ’ Writer

Calls for unity and solidarity
rang through the Towers patio 
over 200 black students formed a
human circle to join together for
the first annual Black Cultural
Center “Gathering of Warriors”
rally last night.

“The Black Cultural Center
will be on this campus, and we
need all the black students on
this campus to get ‘together.
That's what this is for!” Black
Action Society Public Relations
Chairperson Vanessa Liles said.

“We need the base for our
community so we can start get-
ting together,” student Brian
Turner said. “Right now is a dan-
gerous time for black people.
We need to get together and
start unifying.”

According to one BAS mem-
ber, Michael S. Barge, the pur-
pose of the rally was “to educate
all students, but speciﬁcally black
students or African students, on
what a cultural center would
stand for, how it would work
and how it would benefit them.”

Students joined forces to
exchange information concern-
ing the development of the BCC,
as well as the need for more
support for black students in
general.

BAS members Darryl Wiley (left) and Tony Scott (center) spoke at last night's rally.

“The need [for the Black
Cultural Center] comes out of the
need to get history straight and
knowing the conditions of your
people,” Daniel Gaines said.

The 1991-1992 BAS Steering
Committee and the current
Steering Committee were major
forces in the development-of the
idea for a cultural center. On
Feb. 12, members of BAS and
the black community marched
from Lothrop Hall to Chancellor

J. Dennis O’Connor’s office. The
march culminated in the presen-
tation of the proposal for the
BCC by members of the BAS
Steering Committee to the chan-
cellor.

BAS Executive Assistant Keith
E. Davis said, “The intent of the
movement is toeducate students
on the important details and the
implications a. Black Cultural
Center would have on the Cam-
pus of the V University of

Pittsburgh  BAS is doing every-
thing it can to continue the
process of educating students on
this issue.”

According to Davis, the money
for the cultural center could

come from a lot of different

sources.

“We want the university to
take responsibility in providing
for the needs and concerns of
black students on campus,” he

Pitt is challenged by ACLU
over censorship of student

By Kelly B. Casey
and John Temple
T be Pitt News

Facing a possible censorship law-
suit, Pitt has its lawyers searching for
a way to legally ban a student’s art-
work from the upcoming Pitt Program
Council’s Student Art Show.

Pitt’s lawyers are debating the case
with the American Civil Liberties
Union, which began investigations
Monday. Both Pitt and the ACLU,
which is representing the student, said
they may go to court if they do not
reach an agreement soon.

“If the university does not come up
with an agreeable response by next
week, we will work as fast as we can
to get it into a courtroom,” ACLU
Executive Director Wiltold Walczak
said.

The PPC Art Committee and the
Student Affairs Office rejected David

' Brown’s painting last week, saying it

was too “offensive” to display. The
work contains a tree in which the
branches resemble penises and the
trunk resembles testicles.

“My position really hasn’t changed
all that much,” Vice Chancellor of
Student Affairs William Harmon said.
“We’re waiting for some kind of
response from [legal] counsel to allow
us to legally reject it.” ’

The ACLU does not believe Pitt will

-beable to reject the work on the

grounds of obscenity.

“I think the only way the university
could keep the work out is to argue
that it is obscene, and that is going to
be difficult,” Walczak said. “They
could say that many people would be
offended by it, but being offended
does not equate to obscenity.”

Pitt General Counsel Lewis Popper
is taking another approach at keeping
the ACLU at bay. He said he thinks
the case can stay out of court if it is
proven the student committee was act-

ing as a private group, not as a repre-

sentative of Pitt.

“Are they the university or not?”
Popper said. “I don’t know.”

If Harmon, a governmental authori-
ty, makes the final decision to ban the
work, the ACLU could sue Pitt for vio-
lating Brown’s First Amendment rights,
Popper said.

Harmon said he is leaving it in the
hands of the students, who may or
may not be subject to the Constitution.

“PPC will make the final decision,”
Harmon said. “If they want it to, the
case will go to court.” ‘

Popper said that only representa-
tives of government institutions, not
individuals, are subject to the
Constitution. Because Pitt is state
funded, it is subject to the
Constitution.

Students caught
in rWorld Trade
Center explosion

By Beth Kovaly
Asst News Editor

Imagine being at the top of the World
Trade Center in New York City -- all 110
floors up.

Then imagine that you can’t take the (9

elevator back down because smoke is
pouring out of it.

Pitt sophomores Deborah Ryan and Beth
Shahade were sightseeing in New York
City last Friday. They were on the 107th
floor of the Trade Center when a bomb
went off in the parking garage over 100
floors below. v

Shahade said they planned on getting
through the tour quickly to go shopping at
Macy’s. They had looked around and were
waiting for the elevator to go back down
when Shahade said she smelled smoke.

“All of a sudden they told us to get back
because the whole upper deck started fill-
ing with smoke,” Ryan said. “We were
like, ‘what’s going on,’ because they really

‘ weren’t telling us anything.”

A fire alarm went off, and everybody
was told to move away from the elevators.
“They told us that there was a fire on
the 104th floor of the other building,”
Ryan said. “But we kind of knew they
were lying. When the smoke got really

There  support available to help the mentaﬂy iﬂ

ental illness in our
M society is pervasive.
As many as one per-
son in five has a diagnosable
emotional disorder that
requires professional help.
This means that almost all of
us have some exposure to
mental illness either in our
immediate family or in our
network of close relatives.
Some college students have
grown up in a household
where a parent or sibling has
had a long term emotional ill-
ness and they sometimes seek
counseling to help them
understand, or work through
some of the personal prob-
lems that can result from this
experience. Others come in
asking how they can help a
family member who is experi-
encing emotional difficulties.
In the case of helping a
family member, it is difficult
for students to know how
severe a problemhas to be
before they should seek out-
side assistance. Sometimes
the behavior cha'nge that is

noted is so dramatic that
there is no question that out-
side help is needed. For
instance, when a family mem-
ber exhibits exceptionally
bizarre behavior, reports see-
ing or hearing things that no
one else sees or hears or
makes a suicidal gesture, the
student usually knows assis-
tance isneeded.

selves that the person is just
going through a stressful peri-

it. If the behavior persists,

Lock it up or take it
with you over break

By Cory Walborn
and John Temple
The Pitt News

Unloading the car upon
your return from Spring
Break, don’t be surprised to
see someone walk by listen-
ing to your Walkman: YOU
DlDN’T TAKE IT HOME
VUITH YOU.

Although the residence
hall security has been tight-
ened recently, criminals find
ways to break in. For
instance, a person with a
master key burglarized the
same four Holland Hall
rooms two Thanksgivings in
a row.

Don’t leave jewelry, credit
cards, computers, typewrit-
ers, stereos or keys in your
room over the break. If you
don’t want to lug everything
home “let your fingers do
the walking” and rent stor—

age space near campus.
Here are other safety mea-

sures to take:

-Close and lock all win-

dows and doors.
°Close all blinds.
-Leave a light on a timer so
someone appears to be
home at night.
-Do not leave anything
flammable on or near the
heaters.
-Make sure you unplug all
appliances and lights (but
don’t forget to leave your
timer plugged in). ,
-Ask a neighbor to watch
your apartment while you
are gone.
-Have someone collect
your mail or request that it
be held until after break.
-Change the message on
your answering machine.
(Don’t let everyone know
you are laying on a beach.)
-Make sure you take your
keys with you.
-Have your valuables
engraved for no cost by the
campus police (Operation
I1)'— For more information,
call 648-2121).

Good luck —— and don’t
forget your \Y/alkman.

New federal studentaid
programs have pros and cons

By Thanita Adams
For The Pitt News

Significant changes have been made
concerning the guidelines for federal
student financial aid (Title IV Federal
Financial Aid Programs) that will be
effective starting with the 1995-‘94
school year.

These changes, which were approved
by Congress in July, 1992, will affect the
management and awarding of Title IV
aid. While many of the adjustments
should be helpful, others may reduce
the award amount for some students.

The most significant changes pertain
to federal Pell Grants and federal loans
including Stafford Loans, unsubsidized
Stafford Loans, SLS Loans and PLUS
Loans.

According to a fact sheet, less—than—
part-time students will now be eligible
for consideration for Pell Grants. In
addition, students may receive a Pell
Grant for as long as it takes them to
complete their first undergraduate
degree. In previous years, there was a
five-year limit on eligibility. . _

As a break for parents, home equity
and family farms are no longer included
in the asset analysis if the family lives
there, said Bruce Neimeyer, a financial
aid counselor at Pitt.

On the down side, the definition of an
independent student has become
stricter. According to Neimeyer, students
will be considered independent only if
they are:

-24 years of age or

Oan orphan or ward of the court or

0a graduate or professional student or

-a married student or

-have legal dependents other than a
spouse. .

Unlike previous years, students will
no longer be independent based on
their income and the fact that their par-
ents did not claim them as exemptions
on their federal tax returns.

Neimeyer said that this loophole was
removed because it was being abused
by families who could actually afford to
contribute to the student’s education.

“I would say about 90 percent of the
students affected by this change fall into
that category,” Neimeyer said.
“Unfortunately, the other 10 percent
who really need the money are being
penalized.” '

Other than students fitting the present
guidelines, only those who can prove
extenuating circumstances may be con-
sidered for independent status. Appeals
can be made to the Independent
Appeals Committee, which is comprised
of senior staff members at Pitt’s Office
of Financial Aid.

“\X/e’re being really sticky about the
situation because the government is,”
Neimeyer said.

Also eliminated from the Pell Grant
program are allowances for medical and
dental expenses, secondary school
tuitions and special consideration for
dislocated workers and displaced home-
makers.

Changes to Stafford and SLS Loans
include raising the limits that can be

borrowed for upper-
class students.
However, PLUS Loan
maximums are now

limited to the cost of
education minus other

financial aid.
Unsubsidized loans
are now available
nationally.

According to
Neimeyer, some of
these changes have
occurred because

Congress has put more
funding into the Pell
Grant and Stafford
Loan programs. He
added that higher loan
limits may seem
advantageous now,
but students will be
burdened by greater
debt when they gradu-
ate.

While these changes
may seem unexpected,
they are quite routine.
Every five years
Congress meets to
revamp the Federal
Student Aid system,
Neimeyer said. The
new guidelines will
stick until the 1998-99
school year when .the
system will once again
be evaluated.

“We had no clue there was a
bomb,” Shahade added.

They were moved up to the
110th floor, the outside obser-
vation deck, where they stayed
for about three—and—a-half
chilly hours.

“It was so cold,” Ryan said.
“You had the snow, the air
and then the helicopters
all around us, but not a
lot of people went back
inside because it was so
smoky."

They agreed the atmosphere
on the roof was relaxed.

“F.ve1yone up there was real-
ly joking around, so we just
joined in,” Ryan said.

It took another hour and a
half to make the long descent
through the stairwells to the
ground floor.

“There were no lights,” Ryan
said. “We were led down by
one little ﬂashlight which died
out about halfway down.”

“We were all holding hands
in a single—file line,” Shahade
said.

They had to change stair-
wells because the one they
were in began to get too hot

up there,” Shahade said.

“We were probably about 15
minutes away from’ the explo-
sion,” Ryan said. “We got off
the PATH [train] and went
right upstairs.”

When they got back to Pitt,
the two sorority sisters of
Delta Phi Epsilon found them-
selves the focus of local media
attention.

The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

first interviewed them
after Shahade’s sorority
big sister called the paper to
say they had been in
the building. Since then,
they have been interviewed
by channel four, 102.5

WDVE and WVTY—FM 96 -
and they are going to be on a
local morning show early
today.

At first, though, when they
tried to tell Pitt friends about
the experience, nobody
believed them.

“They thought we were kid-
ding,” Shahade said.

“I had to show my friend the
newspaper article before he
would believe me,” Ryan
added.

The two students said the
experience hasn’t changed
them much. '

“I want to go back and actu-
ally see New York,” Ryan said.
“I haven’t seen New York at

BAS Political Action
Chairperson Darryl Wiley
said, “The institution doesn’t
want to pay you any damn
respect  it’s proven we can
change things  they won’t
love us but we can change
things.”

In opposition to Wiley’s
statement, Davis said
O’Connor is committed to
creating a positive environ-
ment for African—American
students at the university;

“Currently, the chancellor
has verbally agreed to
improve or increase the reten-
tion rate of African-American
students to 67 percent. The
current rate is 35 percent.
And the hiring of Dr. Nancy
Washington as the assistant to
the chancellor for Minority
Affairs clearly shows his coin-
mitrnent to the improvement
of the conditions for African-
American students,” Davis
said. “Now it is the responsi-

bility of the Black Action
Society’s leadership to
advance the struggle for the
Black Cultural Center.”

Another BAS member said
that it is important for the
issue to be made public, so
that more people will know
about it.

“Everybody will come up
to the office  We need to
generate conversation that
will help uplift ourselves,”
BAS Membership Chairperson
Andrew George said.

According to BAS
Programming Chairperson
Kevin Farmer, every
black student on this
campus has 21 commitment,
everyone owes every other
black person something
whether they believe it or
not.

As the rally came to an
end, the students bowed their
heads in a prayer for the uni-
fication of the black commu-
nity and the development of
the BCC.

PERSPECTIVE

PAGE 7

Cultural center needed

Blacks have a retention rate of 33 percent on the Pitt campus while
their white counterparts have a retention rate of 67 percent.

When Chancellor O’Connor appointed Dr. Nancy Washington
assistant to the chancellor on Minority Affairs he took an important
step toward improving the African-American students’ situation on
campus and improving retention rates.

But while the appointment of Dr. Washington was vital to the uni-
versity community, the administration rnust go further. The troubles
facing minorities on campus are large, and the problems will not
cease simply by gaining the chancellor’s ear. The administration can
now help the Black Action Society in its efforts to establish a Black
Cultural Center on campus.

BAS has been pushing hard for this center, and the rest of the com-
munity should join in. A Black Cultural Center would be an asset to
everyone, although it would have special meaning for African-
American students. More than just a cultural center that celebrates the
achievements of black Americans, it would be a support service for
all students. The proposal includes tutoring services and classrooms
available to the entire Pitt population.

But, as the name suggests, the Black Cultural Center is focused at
black students. And it should be. Making up only 10 percent of the
entire student population, a Black Cultural Center will enable stu-
dents to foster relationships and assimilate much easier into the Pitt
community at large. Cries of separatism will be raised, although it
really isn’t an issue. It is a functional center and not a separatist one.

The question was raised concerning a similar multicultural center
for all students. But the problem with that proposal is its failure to
recognize any culture. It celebrates special interest groups — BiGALA
and the Campus Wornenis Organization among them —— not cultures.
The black cultural center transcends the goals of the multicultural
center and has bee.n undertaken with much greater‘ attention to
detail. Heading the center would be a full-tinre administrator, and
services offered would be diverse. The university needs this center,
and the administration should help BAS push for it.

No risk and no reward

To help alleviate some of the Bosnian anguish, President Clinton
ordered an air drop that would deliver vital medical and food sup-
plies into the war-torn countryside of Bosnia-Herzegovina. It failed
miserably, and it isn’t difficult to understand why.

The flights were more symbolic than they were substantive.
Unarmed and unescorted U.S. C-130 cargo planes ﬂying at 10,000
feet and higher were dropping the supplies in mountainous valley
regions. With the exception of_ Tuzia, the targeted towns are sur-
rounded by hostile Serbian factions. Tuesday afternoon the expected
occurred. Serbian forces overran the Muslim enclave of Cerska in
eastern Bosnia and stole the medical supplies that were supposed to
be for the Bosnians. The Serbian action was both an embarrassment
for the United Nations and the Clinton Administration.

As peace talks prove slow and tedious, the air drop has proved
another mistake for the United States and European Community deci-

sion-makers who are ah'eady at wits end. Thus far, negotiators have

moved slowly trying to keep the risk at a minimal level. But this
recent episode, along with all the others, proves to us that it will be
impossible to accomplish anything in this region without taking real
risks. _

An operation taken on a large scale is now necessary to end these
shenanigans. Enforcement by air, coupled with massive forces of sol-
diers -— British, French, German, Turkish, Danish, American, etc. -
is essential to bring this to a close. Lives will be lost, but more lives
will be saved. However, the United States cannot do it alone, nor can
it just take the lead. The time has now come for everyone — the
United Nations and a post Cold War NATO — to halt Serbian aggres-
sron.

The same old tax and spend Dem

Here’s the new boss, same as
the old boss.

The “new Democrat,”
President Bill Clinton, gave his
long—awaited economic‘ speech
two weeks ago. As I look at the
speech I see major sections on
tax increases, spending increas-
es and helping small segments
of the population- Sounds like
an old Democrat to me.

During the campaign, Bill
Clinton’s policy was that if the
sun came up, he should talk
about the economy. Now that
he is the president, he feels like
he has to do something about
the economy. However, since
November, economic figures
have turned up and experts
have speculated that the reces-
sion ended last May.
Productivity is up, consumer
confidence is up and consump-
tion is up. -

Still, the president looks at
this economy and sees a prob-
lem. He talks about the lack of
job growth in this recovery.
Unemployment is still at the
relatively high 7.1 percent —
never mind that job growth
usually does not come until 15
months after the beginning of a
recovery. He was elected to
make a difference, and by
golly, he will.

The president wants to
reduce unemployment so he
can say he did something to
help the economy. Clinton
wants to infuse over $30 billion
into the economy to give jobs
in rebuilding infrastructure,
making environmental im-
provements and other industrial
areas.

One of the bright spots of
our past recession was the lack

of inflation. The government
adding money to the economy
is inflationary by nature.
Clinton’s stimulus package will
also require more government
borrowing, which will increase
the budget deficit that Clinton
already said was so far out of
hand the middle class could
just forget about that tax cut
and open up its collective wal-
let in the name of patriotism.

Kichline
About those taxes, why not
just let the American people
spend their own money instead
of the government having to
borrow money to increase
demand? The money we give
to the government will not help
the economy. Money spent by
consumers has a greater effect
on the economy than money
spent by the government.

But aside from the practical,
Clinton will have to play poli-
tics and get this through
Congress. There are loads of
regions and representatives that
would love to have this money
brought to their hometowns.
There is likely to be a whole
lot of wrangling going on over
that. If you consider that along
with the normal amount of
time we usually wait for
Congress, we may not see this
stimulus for several months.
Then the question becomes,
how much do the people now
finding work and the growing
economy really need this pro-
gram? Was putting the govern-
ment that much more into debt
really worth it? What about

next year? If infrastnrcture is so
important, will the outlays con-
tinue next year, or will they
cease to be a priority?

On the matter‘ of priorities,
Clinton repeated that health
care reform is the most impor-
tant item on his political agen-
da.

I-le almost cried when he had
to talk about it. If he wants to
provide insurance for all
Americans this will require
more money, which will have
to come from somewhere.
Watch your wallet!

Like Presidents Franklin
Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson,
Clinton believes that if there is
a problem, government must
fix it. Unfortunately, the pro-
grams created by these men
have become too much of a
burden on our government.

Entitlements are killing our
budget, and he wants to
expand some of them.
Roosevelt and Johnson took
care of the problems that were
facing the nation with their
programs.

But the problems facing this
nation have become too large
and we must find more effi-
cient ways to administer the
needs of the American people.
President Clinton should not
perpetuate the growth of our
welfare state or the notion that
government actions are the
best cures for a failing econo-
my.

Bill Clinton campaigned as a
different kind of Democrat. He
wants to fix things. I just hope
we don’t get fooled again.

Autry, Orange gunning for Pitt

By Matt Silverman
Staff Writer

In the days gone by, cowboy
Gene Autry patrolled the wild
west singing songs and win-
ning the hearts of anyone who
came across his white hat and
good-guy disposition. He was
quick to the heart and slow to
his holster.

Unfortunately for Pitt this
Saturday, Syracuse’s Adrian

Autry resem-
bles the for-
mer only in
name.
As the
Pitt Panthers
round
their regular-
season Big East schedule
Saturday at Syracuse, they will
once again have to deal with
the quick-shooting Autry. The
junior point guard out of New
York City nailed six of seven
three—pointers and finished
with 31 points as Syracuse
blew out the Panthers 95-79 at
the Civic Arena in late January.

Hot shooting by Autry and a
solid performance by swing-
man Lawrence Moten (25
points, 4 rebounds) — com-
pounded by a switch to a zone
defense —-— gave the Panthers
severe problems and snapped
their four-game win streak in
their last meeting.

This weekend, after a recent
two-game win streak including
a victory at Villanova, the
Panthers will bring their teeter-
ing NCAA Tournament hopes
into the hostile confines of the
Syracuse Carrier Dome, where
they are 3-7 lifetime, and will
no doubt face more zone and
more of Autry’s “guns a-firing”
style of play.

At stake for the Panthers is
not only a chance to knock off
every Big East team at least
once this season, but, more
importantly, to try and seal a
birth into the NCAAs.

For the Orangemen, other
than sheer pride and a higher
seed in the Big East tourney,
they will be playing the spoiler
since NCAA sanctions from
rules violations prohibit the
‘Cuse from participating in the
“big dance.”

Despite their lack of reasons
for motivation, Coach Jim
Boeheim’s crew has gone 17-8
(9-8) and should pose some
serious problems for the
Panthers.

The Orangemen sport the

The end has finally arrived.

After countless hours in the

season has finally come to an end

Predicting what will unfold
next weekend at Madison
Square Gardens annual week-
end party, known as the Big
East Tournament, is one sure
way to make a sportswriter
look foolish. This particular
prognostication should be
prefaced with a disclaimer,
seeing that just about any team
in the conference is capable of
beating any of the others.
Throw logic to the wind here.

Nevertheless, the probable
bracket setup should produce
some very interesting quarterfi-
nal matchups. Two new
friends, Pitt and Boston
College, will probably be fac-
ing off. After prevailing in a
rugged affair here, Pitt will run
into a raucous Madison Square
Garden crowd in Saturday’s
semifinals against St. John’s.

Meanwhile, the overwhelm-
ing preseason favorite, a surg-
ing Seton Hall crew, should
blow into the semis against a
dangerous Syracuse. The
Orange should survive

Connecticut, the Big East’s
powerhouse of the future, in
an intriguing quarterfinal tilt.
The Huskies, built around a
fabulous quartet of sopho-
mores, have the look of a dev-
astating force two years down
the road.

The Orange were a solid
choice to win this thing a few
days ago, but Monday they
failed to show up against St.
Johns and were blown out by
20. That raises some doubts.
However, the Orange are
clearly a superior club when
fired up, and their intensity
will overﬂow here since there’s
no “big dance” for them.

This is the big one for the
‘Cuse, that has silenced critics
this season. Conrad McRae and
Adrian Autry are two of the
most improved players in bas-
ketball. There was never a
question about the thorough-
bred talentof this pair, but

Grinning, local Thickheads entertain for a better future

By Mike Shanley
Staﬂ‘ Writer

The members of Thickhead Grin
sit in the living room of lead gui-
tarist Patty Pisula. \Vhen the topic
of the bands style comes 
up in the discussion, each
member throws in a
description.

Pisula says the band
sounds psychedelic with-
out intentionally striving for
that style.

In between stamping
postcards that advertise the
band’s next show, bassist
Ellen Faith says, “Its groovy
and its hard, but its beauti-
ful and soft. And you can’t
escape it."

Al Vish, the band’s
drummer, who has been
silent until now, calmly
pipes up saying he hates
how the word alternative is
used so ‘frequently as a
blanket statement for bands
like his who do not easily
fit into a popular musical
style.

“Were not an alterna-
tive,” Vish says. “I hate that
temi.

“I mean Elvis was an alternative
to Glenn Miller,” he says. “Glenn
Miller was an alternative to who
knows what before that. To me, it’s

 

ickhe

just music. Its just something new,
that’s all it is.“

But when it comes to music,
Pittsburgh audiences usually shy
away from something new. At least
they did until recently.

Pisula attributed the

like the Red Hot Chili

garnered popularity
through college radio and
independent labels before
reaching mainstream suc-

career with the Pittsburgh Symphony:
“The man who engaged me as principal

was famous for being very

The Crying Game— Director
Neil Jordan's thriller has
earned six Oscar nominations

the film itself, this effect can
be weighed on various scales,
testing the limits of how far a

means. “It intelligently deals
with identity, love, bonds and
allegiances and the conflicts

that arise from them.”

Enchanted April- Mike

Newell’s film falls somewhere
between predictable and slow
without ever becoming tire-

Vega still paving the femme song style

By Mike Shanley
Staﬂ’ Writer

Since her debut album in 1985,
singer/guitarist Suzanne
Vega continues to rede-
fine the terminology of
folk music and female
songwriters. On Sunday
she returns to
Pittsburgh for a show at
the Rosebud.

Vega started out in
the New York City folk
scene. With each of the
four albums the song-

Records. She combines
her folk roots with
accessible pop struc-
tures, gaining herself an
audience that ranges
from middle-aged yup-

funny and I never
dreamed that it would be
a big hit,” she later admit-
ted. “To me it was like
translating the song inltol
another language.”

99.9 F Degrees, Vegas
most recent album, found
her changing her style
and image. The album
cover pictured her face
engulfed in flames.
Musically, she experi-
mented with elements of
industrial dance music on
several tracks, which cre-
ated a bizarre but suc-
cessful ambiance.

Her deadpan delivery adds
intensity to her songs rather than
taking away any effect. It
enhances the rich, poetic imagery

“Injustice and the idea that

Faced Hemians are here with God Is My Co-
Pilot. Scottish expatriates planted in Holland,
DFH’s melt abandoned ker-punk, ska, jazz
and ethnic folk swing into the soundtrack for
the fractured fairy tale your life should be.
Several imported artifacts are the foundation
of the Dogface discography, but the group
was first heard by Yanks on the “Too Much
For the Red Ticker” 7 inch and the Mental
Bl0Cl6‘ For All Ages CD both on the label of
the poli-left leaning Jonestown, Project A
Bomb Records.

The Dogfaced are fronted by the impish
Marion, weaving encrypted political
metaphors amongst blaring cavalry ch_arges
on her trumpet. The four others construct a
soundbed that is the foundation of panic,
guitar—spitting well—timed dissonant bombs to
the precisely chaotic ignition of the skins; a
rhythm that is impossibly on, yet thankfully
tossed off by the rhythmic sidekick Geit—_]an
on found—sound, proving that the cowbell
has since thrusted light years beyond the
dark ages of Mountain and “Mississippi
Queen.”

The scavenging nature of l)FH‘s style
allows an exploration into divergent musical
territories denied more shackled units. A five-
some that can cover Ornette Co1eman’s
“Peace \X/arriors” ( Project A Bomb split 7
inch w/ jonestown and Honkies) and tour
Eastern Europe with Hungarian folkpins
Mtiszikas, is well, impressive. Yet this squad
is of the global—anarcho brand 0’ F.tu‘o-tune
that bred The Ex and Chumbawamba, so the
multixtult experience is high on the agenda.

complement. God Is My Co-Pilot takes the
varietal and contemporary concerns of the
Dog Faced Hermanns and transplants them
to the Lower East Side. The group’s got that
same rhythmic jaunt, a little less epic, a little
more chaotic, combining elements of
Knitting Factory squonk with nursery rhyme

petulance. Riding on a catalog of four seven -

inches and two CDs, GIMCP captured the
gaze of the of the New Yorle Times, the Voice
and other established rags probably by dint
of Knitting Factory associations like horn-
blower John Zom, who squonks on the new
Speed Yr Tnp CD (Ajax Records).

One could gather that the group ain’t
exactly rock. I mean, it exploits the avant-
garde angle enough to escape that relative
stigma. Craig Flanagin’s guitar approach
recalls the whole lawnmower sound that
came from Aito Lindsay and Marc Ribot, but
you can hear Andy Gill in there as well.
\X/hat breaks it all down is Sharon Topper

bops around the stage, pinballirrg in a mini-
dress, but whats miked is bark, growl and
howl; a ferocious mating call for lovers of
many names “like Senseleigh, or Fly.” Two
dnuiimers too, by default — bang a gong.

Of course the local component is appro-
priately teetering on the edge of self-annihila-
tion. Guitarist M.C. Lingo is out on furlough
from house an‘est so that Swob can warm up
the audience with early Milton Berle style
stand-up noise.

If the Dog Faced Hermans and God Is My
Co-Pilot mangle elder forms into crafted

cranking then The Grifters sculpt a dissonant '

foggy foo into labyrinthine and cathartic
pathways to your pleasure center.

They booby trap traditional pop—r'ock
structure with white noise and pedaled and
pre-recorded effects to write the themes to
every long—distance road trip without a cas-
sette deck. The classic radio station you’ve
withstood for an hour is being overridden by
the control tower of the Air Force base you
are passing on the left while Christian talk
radio comes in undemeath, and you can just
barely make out the subliminals telling you
to kill for Jesus. '

The Grifters are Memphis pariahs. Denied
any kind of following in the town that bred a
whole tradition of useless music, the band
has emerged from that morass into the indie
net while still maintaining a mysterious
anonymity that is reflected in the noise.

Making the scene over the past two years
with a variety of 7 inch on the Doink and
Shangri—La labels, the Grifters evolved into
full-scale rabid romantic raindogs with the
release of the So Happy T@ether CD (Sonic
Noise). A never-ending climaxing mumble, it
slips in and out of musical consciousness like
a dreamy half sleep; alternating fevered
nightmares with galloping rides across the
arena rock prairie, a heady landscape of
weirdness tempered by an underlying stabili-
ty in memories of sanity.

A break from chaos is in order Thursday
from Gaunt — straight ahead garage punk
from Colombus. To date they‘ve got, among

and Whitey the Man 10 inch on the
Datapanik label.

And goddamn! If all that don’t blow your
towers, you get the gem of Pittsburgh rock to
boot. In the afterglow of the Some Girls Lilae
Cigarettm 10 inch, the Karl Hendricks Trio
celebrates the release of the brand new
“Baseball Cards” b/w “Smartypants” 7 inch
on Mind Cure. Karl, as prolific as he is
maudlin, is the only rounder imaginable for
two evenings of rare and deserved rock
sophistication.

Ironically, Pisula planned on
retiring from music around the
same time. After playing with
garage rockers the Pleasure Heads
for three years, she left in 1991. She
had acquired tendonitis in her left
hand, making it painful to play gui-
tar. But things changed when she
met Thickhead Grin.

The band impressed Pisula the
first time she saw them perfomi.
“They were the most beautiful
band I ever saw,” Pisula says.
“Everybody had such a unique

look and it sounded so good.”

But Pisula could hear places
where a second guitar belonged in
the band. Although she never
intended to be the guitarist herself,
Johanson asked her to try out for
the band. Initially the rest of the
band felt uneasy about another gui-
tarist.

“I didn’t really Want anyone
else,” Faith says. “I thought what
we had was really cool and differ-
ent. But then Patty filled in all the

its first show as a quintet in April.

In performance, Thickhead Grin
can cause a sensory overload. A tall
black candelabra stands in front of
the stage and incense permeates
the air, creating the soothing effect
Grosick needs to get in the mood.

The high volume attack of the
guitars offsets the arresting sound
of Grosick’s voice. She stands at
center stage, usually with both
hands grasping the microphone,
her long, curly black hair hides her
eyes.

Faith usually stands at the
singer’s right. She barely
moves, but she provides
the music’s foundation with
her solid bass lines. Next to her

the two women create the most
noticeable aspects of the band’s
sound.

While the rest of the band stands
fairly still, totally enraptured with its
performance, johanson jumps
around his side of the stage.
Behind him, clad in headphones to
muffle the loud volume, Vish ham-
mers away on his skins, jet-pro-
pelling the beat.

Grosick says (lining a set she can
sense the attention of an audience.
“Every crowd we play to is either
sitting there completely attentive or
dancing,” she says. “We always
leave them smiling. People are

Prank phone call from a sports nut

Try calling an unpleasant
acquaintance — someone you
know who you don’t like and
who does not like you. Then
start making idiotic small talk
until the person is ready to kill
you.

Sooner or later, the question
will burst forth from the rather
annoyed acquaintances lips —
“What do you want?”

In this case, nobody really
wants an answer to this ques-
tion. The person wants you off ,
the phone. The only true way to
draw the fullest pleasure out of
this situation is to have a list of
answers ready. Make it a long
list. Let me give you an example.

. -As a sports writer, I want to
be paid like the athletes I write
about. As a co-worker of mine
pointed out, hype from sports
joumalists is a big part of them
getting the big bucks, so like
their agents, I want my cut.

Since I write for a college
paper now I will settle for a full
scholarship until I graduate. I
won’t ask for under-the-table
money, because I want to be
able to take a holier-than—thou
attitude if I ﬁnd out about some
athlete getting such a deal. Of
course, once I go pro, I will
have to ask for a few million a
year and an insane signing
bonus.

The purpose to all this: so

then she'll do it,” Bruce said. “But
she’s always going to be there,
intimidating, blocking shots and
that type of thing.”

In the game that decides who
Miami will face in the quarterfinals,
the St. John’s Express holds a
decided advantage over the
Syracuse Orangewomen, most
notably in their depth.‘

Syracuse features two highly-
proficient players — point guard
Erin Kenneally and center Holly
Oslander. They then drop off con-
siderably.

“St. John’s has much more bal-
ance,” Foley said. “They’ve got
good defensive balance. If they
can stop one of the two big guns
[Kenneally and Oslander] then
they will have the advantage.”

“lOslander‘sl being double and
triple teamed in the post,”
Syracuse head coach Barbara
Jacobs said. “We're going to try to
pull her out of the post and let her
slash to the basket, making it hard-
er for the other team to guard her.”

The Express will look to for-
wards Coleta Brown (9.2 board
per game) and Pam Odom and
guard Patrina Blow (514 three-
point percentage) for not only
scoring but also rebounding and
inside strength.

In the second of the two first-
round games, the host Friars face
the Boston College Eagles and the

This logic is insane, but so is
the logic that makes Pirate third
baseman Jeff King ask for over
$1 million per year. This guy
can’t get a hit in three straight
games without thinking, “Hey,
wait a minute! I’m not good
enough to do this.”

This is the same man who 7799

to as the league leader in self-
doubt. All of a sudden, when it
comes time to get paid, he
thinks he’s a star? The Pirates

While most of Pitt’s stu-
dent body is anxiously
awaiting the opportunity
to get away from the
everyday stress of classes
and homework with the
anticipation of basking in
the sun in Florida or
some other hot spot, the
Pitt women’s gymnastics
team has been grounded
in the gym in preparation
for some key meets tak-
ing place over Spring
Break.

Before getting on a
plane and heading toward
North Carolina State for a
meet at the end of next
week, Pitt is hosting two
meets during Spring
Break. The first is on
‘Saturday, March 6 at 7:50
p.m. against Ohio State
and Towson State. The
other meet is being held
on Tuesday, March 9 at 1
p.m. against West Virginia

Saturday’s meet is cru-

said. “We hope to carry
our positive attitude into
this weekend and
throughout the remainder
of the season.”

Winning on Saturday
will not be an easy task
for Pitt. Ohio State is cur-

until January of this season.

Now McRae is a menacing,
intimidating force in the paint ——
blocking shots and dunking in
eveiybody’s face. Autiy has been
an unstoppable floor general at
times, drilling jumpers, dishing
and running the best fast break in
the league. But Seton Hall still
must retain the role of favorite.

Logic says Terry Dehere, Jerry
Walker and company will prevail
in preparation for an exciting
NCAA run, but logic does not
carry any weight here. Take
Syracuse to reach the finals
against St. Johns, and contrary to
what my fellow hoops gum Jason
Brame says, the probation—1aden
Orangemen will spoil everyone’s
Garden Party by detailing an
overachieving St. Johns club.

So like Memphis State did a few
seasons back, winning the Metro
T oumey when banished from the
NCAA Toumament, Syracuse will
win a championship and negate
the Big East’s automatic bid.

New York —— next week ——
here’s the story.

In the preliminary Thursday
evening matchups, the Big East
tourney began auspiciously as No.

The other matchup pitted a
woeful shooting number eight

allowing the Hurricanes only six
second—half baskets and making

first-year sensation Steve Edwards

tourney debut a miserable outing,
holding him to three of 16 shoot-
ing, including seven misses fonn
three—point range.

Friday afternoons quarterfinals
began with the number four
Syracuse taking on number five
UConn in an intense showdown.

The Orange clinging to a tight.

man defense, score the game’s
final nine points and overcome a
12-point first half deﬁcit to elimi-
nate the Huskies behind John
\Wa1lace’s 15 points and 16
rebounds. The two vs seven
matchup featured hometown St.
John’s laying it all over a weary
Providence bunch who couldn’t
rebound or stop the hot hand of
Derek Brown, who lit up the
Friars for 25 points.

Friday evening matched the
number one Seton Hall Pirates
against a fired up Hoya group
who forced 26 Pirate turnovers
before Othella Harrington and
joey Brown fouled out and Bryan

throws down the stretch to con-
quer Georgetown.

interesting to see how
well the teams match
up against one anoth-
er.

Towson State, on the
other hand, is no
stranger to Pitt. These

two teams compete
against each. other
every year, with

Towson state usually

getting the upper hand-

Pitt did hand Towson
State one of its only
losses in recent years
back in 1991, which
just so happened to be
right here in the con-
fines of Trees Hall. If
history holds true, this
could be a good meet
for Pitt.

West Virginia annual-
ly provides a challenge

for Pitt. The
Mountaineers beat the
Panthers back in

January, and they have
since gotten better,
scoring in the high
180s and low 190s
every week since. IUP
will not be as much of
a threat since it lacks
the necessary depth,
with only five or six
gymnasts in the lineup.

Seniors Kristin Brown
and Karen Jorgensen
will be honored for
their performance and
dedication the last four
years on Saturday,
which has been desig-
nated as Senior Night.
Tuesday will be their
last chance to display
their skills in front of
the home crowd.

These last two home
meets are very impor-
tant to these seniors.
Brown has been out
the previous two
weeks because of the
flu, but Yohman said
she would not miss
these final two home
meets for anything.

“Kristin said she
would compete even if
we had to carry her
out of the gym after-
wards,” Yohman said.
“Kristin’s adrenalin will
help her get through
the meet no matter
how she is feeling.”

Both meets are at
Trees Hall main gym.

1), after demolishing a tough West
Virginia team, is currently 20th
and capable of winning the team
title.

“This team has a special oppor-
tunity, it can win the EWL title for
the first time,” Stottlemyer said of
the Parody in the EWL without
Penn State.

With Pitt poised to wrestle for a
common team goal, there are sev-
eral wrestlers who have the
chance ﬁnishing first at EWIs and
advancing to the NCAAs. ,

Steve Budman and Sean Gibbs
are favorites going into the tour-
nament and should advance to
the nationals at Iowa City.
Budman (35-9-2) should be the
top seed at 150 pounds. Likewise,
Gibbs (34-7), who is a perfect 6-0
in dual-meets against league
opponents, will be at the top of
his 167-pound division.

Stottlemyer also said Pitt.
wrestlers John Richey (126), Jeff
Kloiber (190) and Pat Wiltanger
(HWT) should represent the
Panthers well.

“John Richey has a real good
chance [at 126],” Stottlemyer said.
“Kloiber lost to two of these guys
by one point, and don’t count out
Wilt [Wiltanger]. He could finish
first or fourth.” «

Richey, a first-year wrestler,
compiled an impressive 19-9
record and was solid in dual
meets. His 8-4 dual-meet standing
gave Pitt a strong force at 126
throughout the season.

But Richey will face tough com-
petition. A returning All-Ainerican,
Bloomsburg’s Brad Rozanski, is
favored to take the 126-pound
title.

Kloiber, a junior, finished the
season at 18-8 for Pitt. Improving

the NCAAs for the third straight
year.

In the heavyweight division,
Wiltanger has also been "impres-
sive. At times, Wiltanger (22-6)
has shown he has the potential to
make the NCAAS.

Travelling to Lock Haven for

they better beat us with our heads
up.”

The intensity should be there,
and the fact of wrestling oppo-
nents for the second time around
should also help.

“I think it will help us, but it
will help everybody else too,”
Stottlemyer said of the familiar
faces meeting each other at Lock
Haven. “We know what to expect
and we’re capable of taking
advantage of them [the oppo-
nentsl.”

Stottlemyer said the team to
beat is Lock Haven.

“They have pretty good depth,
two outstanding. wrestlers and a
bunch of decent guys.” He also
pointed out Bloomsburg, West
Virginia and Edinboro as the
teams that followed. Stottlemyer
also included Pitt sandwiched
between these EWL heavy-
weights.

“If we get hot, lookout. We are
capable of finishing first or fouith.
It’s that close,” Stottlemyer said.

Eisley and Gerrod Abrams.
Cries of “Paul must go” return
to Oakland, despite PitI’s admit-
tance into the NCAA toumey as
a number nine seed.

Semi-final Saturday has
Syracuse and Seton Hall the first
to tip off. The Orange come out
hot behind Wallace and
Lawrence Moten’s 12 points a
piece at the half. PJ turns a
seven-point deficit into a 21-3
run behind Teny Dehere’s long
bombs, and the Hall cruises in
the second half, waxing the
Orange by 13.

BC and St. John’s play it
much tighter, going to OT
before Eisley scores seven
points for the Eagles in the
extra frame, propelling BC to
the Big East ﬁnals for the first
time in recent memory. The
win also gives them an NCAA
bid.

Sunday’s final shows Seton
Hall as a five—and-a-half-point
favorite, and they come out fast
behind Dehere and Luther

ning up a nine-point halftime
lead. With six to go, BC’s
Howard Eisley fouls out ending

Who’s going to win the Big East
basketball tournament this year?
Who knows. I sure don’t. But
I’ll make a pick and I’ll proba-
bly be wrong. Here goes noth-
ing.

Well, Georgetown won’t win,
this team just can’t do basket-
ball’s essential skill —— shoot.

Villanova could surprise with
an always—durable Lance Miller
leading the attack.

Pulling the upset is exactly
what Miami did last year to Pitt
in the annual tourney. But the
‘Canes won’t be so fortunate
this time around.

Pitt has had a tremendous
season, but a tough zone can
cancel the Panthers’ hopes of
advancing any further than
round one.

Providence might be the best
rebounding team in the Big

East, but it still has to score, and
score often, to advance in New
York.

Having many people toting
Boston College as a contender
for the national title, the Eagles
and Jim O’Brien have the talent,
Malcolm Huckaby, Howard
Eisley and big man Bill Curley,
but will fall in the Big East semi-
finals.

Connecticut is the Big East
team of the future, but the tour-
nament is in the present and
the youthful Huskies are a year
away.

Syracuse has really nothing to
play for (probation cancels out
its NCAA berth), but the team
will play and play hard. Coach
Jim Boeheim won’t let it quit.

St. John’s also has the talent
to capture the Big East title, but
only one thing stands in the
team’s way, my pick — Seton
Hall.

The Pirates not only possess
the talent, but they have the key
ingredient, an All—American
who loves crunchtime and lives
for the Big East Tournament —-—
Terry Dehere. Dehere will lead
Seton Hall to the title and PJ.
Carlesimo will have a happy
March in New York.

T hat’s my pick. I know Seton
Hall is the favorite anyway, but
who knows? I’ll probably be
wrong.

who averaged 24.2 points per
game this season. “She's a great
foul shooter."

“That team scares me,” Bruce
said. "They’re the type of team
that will hang in there on you,
even though they were at the bot-
tom of the conference."

The Eagles also showcase the
leagues leader in assism —— Kerry
Curran (4.8 per game).

To keep up with the high—scor—
ing Eagles, Providence, a partici-
pant in the NCAA Tournament for
the previous four years, must run
an up-tempo offense. 9

“That’s the only way we’re
going to win this tournament,
even though we’re going to have
to go four straight days to do it,”
he said.

The winner of the game will
face the Georgetown Hoyas in the
quarterﬁnals.

Kris Witfill, arguably the best
player in the conference, runs the
show for the Hoyas.

She leads a Hoya team that fin-
ished the season with a 21-5
record, and 12 wins in the final 15
games.

The Hoyas are one of the most
experienced teams in the touma—
ment, a fact that will prove valu-
able in what has liistoiically been
a battleground as far as post-sea-
son conferences go.

“They’re playing a lot on emo-
tion,” Pitt head coach Kirk Bruce
said. “They play real hard, they
press the entire game so that type
of team is going to be in it.”

“They’re probably the hungiiest
team, and that’s what will make
them so effective,” Foley said.
“They have the best senior leader-
ship in the Big East and I think
that you win with seniors.”

Foley, however, does not fear a
Hoya team team that rolled over
Providence twice, first 105-76 at
Georgetown and then 95-85 in
Rhode Island.

“If we get by Boston College,
which I expect to, we can beat
Georgetown,” Foley said. “I know
our players believe that.”

Voted to finish no higher than
seventh in the coaches preseason
poll, the fourth-seeded Pitt

Panthers have benefitted by the
play of seniors Turia Ransom at
center and Jill McElhinny at guard.

But the obvious star on the team
is _lonna Huemrich. The confer-
ence’s third-leacling scorer and
se.venth-leading rebounder is a
lock for All—Big Fast honors at the
end of the season.

"lHuemrichl is one of the pre-
mier players in the league,“ Foley
said.

A major factor in the Panthers‘
quarterfinal game with Villanova
will be the play of Ransom. When
healthy, the (yfoot senior can dom-
inate a ballgame.

“I don't think that Villanova has
anyone down there who can stop
her inside,” Foley said. “Villanova
is an excellent defensive team, but
if Pitt can get the ball inside to
Turia then they’ll win.”

“It's rug—cutting time,” Pitt head
coach Kirk Bruce said. “T uria is
not 100 percent but were going to
expect her to do the things she’s
able to do even more.”

Ransom’s competition inside will
come from Karen Connell, who
handles the ‘Cats’ interior game.
Nikki Benedix is the Wildcats’
most steady player, a 6-foot
guard/forward who cannot only
hit the open jump shot but can
power inside for a needed
rebound.

 played two different kinds
of games [defensively] against
Villanova," Bruce said. “We’re
looking to play a couple of differ-
ent defenses ancl try to pressure
the ball. Just make it tough on
them to make passes."

“I think Pitt’s going to win but
it’s going to take a hell of an
effort,” Foley said. “Pitt has seniors
that they can go to.”

“When [Ransom] is full strength
we win, it’s cut and dry,” Bruce
said.

The final of the quarterfinal

games is between Connecticut and
Seton Hall, two of the most offen-
sive—minded teams in the league.
Rebecca Lobo, Connecticuts for-
ward, is one of the more versatile
players in the league. At 63”,

The play of Turia Ransom will be a huge factor in the fortunes of the Panthers

rebounding and blocks, with 11.3
and 3.7 per game, respectively.

“T hey’ve been there before,”
Bruce said of the Huskies. “Even
though they have younger players
they know what it takes to get to
that final spot.”

A big factor the game will be
Seton Hall’s team strength on the
boards, with Shamona Marable

leading the way for the Pirates
with 8.8 rebounds per game.

“Seton Hall is a great rebound-
ing team,” Foley said. “If they con-
trol the boards with their size, they
can win the game.”

Miami/Georgetown matchup in

many, is on the minds of very few

of the coaches.

“Do we want to get to the ﬁnals?
You’re dam tootin’ we do,” Knapp
said. “But right now we’re focusing
on Providence or Boston College.”

“I think they’re one of the best
teams in the league, if not the best
team, but I can’t predict them
going to finals through us," Foley
said.
