“———Yee, E0, I wtea I HAD BEEN -ABLE TO GETA ooLLEcaE

One of the ﬁrst tangible signs ofimprovement in-the
quality of education at a University is in the area of grad-

uate fellowships. Thus far, four seniors have received no-

tiﬁcation of award of Woodrow Wilson fellowships. Another

"has received a Fullbright.

-. Other students are still in the running for these and
other equally attractive awards. Before this year, the larg-

est number of recipients of Woodrow Wilson grants was .
: two (last year). Before that, an occasional one. '

,Whether or not ~* this reﬁects general improvement in
the faculty or in thecaliber of students is subject to ques-

tion. It certainly reflects the utility and importance of-‘the

Committee on .Graduate Fellowships. Under the capable

 chairmanship of Dr. Roy Heath, this committee locates and

\

groomspotential fellowship candidates. . . «

It provides some solace to the faculty members on the‘
Committeeto do this work whichnecessitates their inter-
viewing the top students on this campus.‘ , A '

This is for them a vacation after a daily attempt to in-
grain knowledge into generally mediocre students.
pi Interviewing committees grill members of the Graduate
Fellowship Group each semester in a sometimes gruelling
manner which prepares them for the even more rigorous
interviews ‘of ‘Foundations granting fellowships.

-This University already has the largest number of
Woodrow Wilson fellowships in Western Pennsylvania.

The University has made much progress in using the
talent we have. As the level of education in this University
generally rises, this Committee on Graduate Fellowships
willplay an increasingly important role. ' ‘

leiist Support of 5' Ward  

The decision by three men’s organizations-besides IF
to support the S—award wasia wise one. The organizations

‘_ will not only provide the means for a worthy junior to

study and‘ travel abroad, but in the joint support of the or-

,- ganizations, these groupsmay be- brought closer together._

The S-awardee on his return can speak before each of
the groups and perhaps before a joint session of the four.
He can bring prestige to himself, the sponsoring organiza-
tions, and the University.throug\h‘speaking engagements

‘in the community. He can portray interesting facets of his

trip in the University and outside publications.
In short, everyone gainsin supporting such awards. In-
terested juniors should make application immediately.

A. Whitney Griswold, headmaster‘ of Yale Uni-
versity since 1950, holds a well—deserved reputa-
tion-for being one of the most outspoken observers
of contemporary America and American education.

Griswold" is an advocate of an uncompromising"

standard of excellence -in educa— ‘
tion. It would not be rashbto
state that he "considers “big
time” college athletics a threat
to intellectual excellence. No
only has be spoken upon this
subject a number of times, but 5
he took. a leading role in putting
Ivy League athletics into what 2
he considered proper prospec-
tive, several years ago.

 

As one of the authors of the ‘Ivy. League ath-.'
letic code,_ Griswold helped'de'-emphasize eastern
intercollegiate athletics among -"the eight‘ "old boys”
which constitute the Ivy League.

It has had the effect ofinaking football, par-
ticularly, a get-together between friends on a ﬁne
Saturday afternoon. Their football is not the ﬁnest,
but then they aren’t interested in national acclaim
for their skill. This inter-collegiate de—emph,asis

. has generally strengthened intra—mural sports at

the eight schools. _
Attacks American Athletics

Apparently not content with reforming just his
own backyard, Dr. Griswold turned his guns upon
the athletic situation in American colleges every-
where, in an. address at Johns Hopkins University,
two weeks ago. ' _ ,-

Using more trencliant language thanis his cus-
tom, Griswold said ‘the athletic scholarship con-

i stitutes “one ofthe greatest educational swindles .

ever plerpetratedon American youth.’Its aim is not
the education of that youth, but the entertainment
of. its elders, not the welfare of theathlete, but
the pleasure of the’sp,ectator.” _
He‘continued by claiming that the market in
athletic contractsiworks to undermine the structure
of American education. “Whether cause or symp-
tom, it is part of the general collapse of amateur-
ism in American athletics and the hypocrisy prac-
ticed in its name.” he said. He_closed his remarks
on the subject by. saying that the continued pre-
occupation .with the “scholarship “racket” is evi-
dence that neither the cold war nor fear of Russia
can provide the sense of purpose needed in edu-
cation today. ’ J
“Sports lovers” of the nation rose immediately
and almost in unison to bid Dr. Griswold return to
his library in New Haven, and to let them have

_ their fun. Most of—his attackers stated that athletic
scholarships give deserving boys an education they _

could not obtain otherwise,_ that athletic programs
are too ‘popular to curb, and‘ that‘ his own school
gives this very aid under a disguised name.

 

  

cholarshipsi

/Maiorl‘Premise Not Refuted
Signiﬁcantly, not «one took issue with his major
premise that the athletic scholarship bribes ‘the

athlete into entertaining a paying audience, and
furthermore, it invites the athlete to play ball and
do very little else. One of the implicit features of
Griswold’s. argument was that frequently the ath-
lete gets a second-class education, if any, because
of the “easy way puts” which are provided to keep
the boy‘ in school. Perhaps his charges were a
little violent,‘but .a hard core of truth resided in
each of them. - ' . ' O ‘

.. The charge that amateurism has collapsed in
American athletics is a valid one. The big sports
all attempt to ape professional standards, and in
the drive to play? ﬂawlessly and win at all costs,
the fun of competition is wrung out with a dis-
ciplined hand. Football‘ is currently a serious busi-
ness, not to be confused with the local rivalries of
the past. Each year the schedules of the big boys
are studded with intersectional games which‘ guar-
antee a bowl bid. if successfully negotiated. But

‘aren’t 65 football scholarships,- yearly, a rather

high cost to pay for that bid?

It is true that the athletic “free ride” has
changed the lives of many boys who could never
have ; paid the registrar themselves. Admittedly,
however, these ﬁne examples are in the minority.
It hardly seems justiﬁed to give a carload of schol-
‘arships each year with the rationalization that a
few of them will provide the golden opportunity
for needy players. On the other hand, these pro-
vide for anabundance of “hired hands,” nothing
more. than that. J

Education Perverted by Amusement

The time has come for more courageous col-
lege administrators to deal ﬁrmly and realistically
with _a problem which grows in seriousness and
complexity everyryear. It is time to turn aside
the pat and steroetyped defenses of athletic schol-

, arship abuses offered by so-called sports fans and

friends of the colleges. The time is past when edu-
cational policy of any kind, including the regula-
tion of athletics, could be dictated by the public
(or immature alumni). The task of contemporary
education is‘ too important to be perverted by the
selﬁsh desire for amusement on the part of
anyone.

The hypocrisy which Dr. Griswold speaks of is
‘a real threat to the integrity of American ‘educa-
tion. If that education .is an important means
available to us, in" remaining a free people,

.shouldn’t it be the best kind possible? Is it too

much to ask to have its internal weaknesses cor-
rected or removed?

The problemis a general one, as Dr. Griswold
pointed out. Its prevalence can be appreciated
when we reﬂect‘lthat_it exists under our own
roof. Is anyone interested in doing something
about it? Or better, can anyone?

A Letters To The Editor

students are “naive.” I

Press Letter‘ ._ Writer

Again Objects. to Red
, Editor, ‘The Pitt ixfews:

’ Out of your sense of justice.

and fair play, I appeal to you to
printthis letter. I am Writing to
defendmyself, for I am that let-
ter writer to the Press whose
“blood is boiling.” 

I can only say that Mr. Whet-
zel’s method of disputation is
unfair. (YM-YWCA Praised for
Communist Talk, March 2,
1959.) I shall proceed to demon-
strate this.

Mr- Whetzel...’-Accuses me of be-
ing “irrational,” bu_t he does
nothing to prove it. The Y’s
braving “irrational Pittsburgh
public opinion” implies that the
opinion was there beforehand. "

If the ‘Y’ had not "taken the
ﬁrst step, there would have been
no rise of opinion to brave.

Whither goes logic?

Just what is “American Leg-
ion patriotism” and why is it
“hardly creditable?” He makes
charges, but proves nothing. J.
Edgar Hoover, who as head of
the FBI ought to know, says that
the American Legion is one of
the most commendable ant.i—red

_ organizations in the country.

“I did not even imply a solu-
tion to the “Communist menace.”

7- He alludes tomy ffeeding , . .

\

But I said nothing about de-
mocracy. I did not even suggest
that Democracy is diametrically
opposed to Communism.

What I object to was the
Red’s being allowed to speak. I
did not attack his listeners, as
Mr. Whetzel seems to think. The

-fact ( I am told) that he did
not deceive anyone does _not
mean that he might not have.
Perhaps nobody'_ was harmed,
but that does, not give a Red the
right to speak. -

Freedom of speech means
freedom to tell the truth, not, as
Whetzel himself says, tell f‘eva-
sive half-truths.”

He alludes to Communism as.

a “political” party. But it is not,
because when it comes _into
power, it outlaws all other par-:
t.ies. Communism does notieven
fulﬁll the deﬁnition of a “p0li—
tical” party.

I wonder which of my phrases
.are “emotion-inspiring.” What
“mobs” does he speak of? The
Pitt student-body? He reads

merely said “some people” need
to know Communism, and the
way to do so is by observing its
infamous actions, not listening to
its “evasive half-truths.”

He seems to think that I in-
clude Pitt students. in my con-
demnationdof Communism. VVhy,
man, you’re. writing _a romance.
I mentioned Pitt once, and that
merely to identify the place of
the speech. If it were to take
place at Duquesne, I would have
mentioned Duquesne; the Post
Office, I would have said the
Post Office; at the Casino, I
would have said the Casino.

I wonder if the Duquesne stu-
dents, the Post Office employees,‘
or the burlesque dancers would
have ridiculed me if they had
imagined that I attacked them
by merely mentioning where the
speech would take place.
