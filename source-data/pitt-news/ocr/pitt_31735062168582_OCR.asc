  Homecoming

L Few people would judge another person on the basis of one small
0 : error he might make. Likewise students should not condemn this year s
. Homecoming Committee simply because of the ticket mix-up on Monday-

‘ The ticket problems came mostly as a result of .the tremendous de-
. mands for seats. One spokesman for Student Government explained that
flsitudents were waiting for tickets before 8a.m. It was these students
'4 decision to start a sign-up list although sales were not-supposed—;to beglii
‘:—..until 11 a.m. ‘ -

; it There was also criticism not only of method of sale but of the number
' “of tickets available. Only nine hundredycouple tickets could be sold because
i the concert is to be held in Carnegie Music Hall. The Committee had no
H choice. The large halls had been booked months before and the University
‘ provides no facility for such large audiences. — _

;_l;_‘ g The main point that shouldn’t be forgotten in the midst of the ticket
«problems is that this year’s Homecoming Committee has done a superior
 rjob. Last year’s arrangements were hardly first class. Instead of having
 a private concert, students were presented with the dubious opportunity
"o;t_"'~hearing class “B” entertainment at a local night club.

 ,7It’.s Chicken   ”

Homecoming 1966 will include the innovation of a bonfire on Thurs-
day when the Homecoming -Queen finalists will be announced. Two floors
of Webster Hall Hotel have been rented for the Friday" night dance where
two different types of bands will play. The Saturday night’s concert boasts
nationally known enter_tainment—-comedian Dick Gregory and folk-rock
group Simon and Garfunkle. -

' Many of the students who were complaining their heads off while
waiting in line on Monday are quick to forget the work that goes into
preparing such a program. The Homecoming Committee represents a small

‘ but essential minority of students who are willing to work and work hard
for the University even though they know that little praise willbe made
for their efforts. Unfortunately only the flamboyant “goofs” make the

The fact is that when students take on such large responsibilities
slip ups are bound to occur. The meager auditorium facilities in the Oak-
land area made the ticket problem an inevitable one. Students who were
lucky enough to get seats should be glad that their Homecoming program
is at least worth seeing.

A‘. ‘ to me to be a certain attitude
1 I prevalent in our society to-

day, an attitude which might

;. S g be described as a paranoic
A vindictiveness on the part of

some of our leaders that
aims vengeance at those peo-
ple critical of our societyf In
a frighteningly lai'ge num-
ber of public statements re-
cently made by members of
the present administration,
doubt has been cast upon the
patriotism of those persons
_and organizations critical of

.0 the Vietnamese war policy.
What exactly is “un-Ameri-‘

can,” “un—patriotic,” “trai-
torous,” and “cowardly” is
not very clear, but it seems

to resemble closely anything‘

approaching dissent from
current policy.

Indications of this attitude

it The Sun Is Not Yellow

by FrankCouvares

were obvious in President
Johnson’s much discussed
“Omaha Speech.” In that
oration the President made
it very clear that he was
quite unreceptive to dissent-

ing opinions of some of the »

people in the intellectual and
university‘ communities, and
went on to derogate_them
for their lack of patriotism
and courage. Coming from
the Commander - in - Chief,
such an address can only be
described as an harangue.
But more important; it e_x—
hibited the arrogant dismis-
sal of critics and the fear of
anything less than consensus
which has become an unat-
tractive trademark of the
Johnson Administration.
When afraid, insecure, un-
certain, and confused, lash
out violently. Such seems to
be the formula.

ANOTHER manifestation  

of the “Johnson Touch” is the
recent “retiring" of Under-
secretary of State George
Ball. As number two man in
the State Department, Ball
became something of annoy-
ance to the President with
his frequent criticisms of
the war policy. With Ball’s
department, the last vestige
of dissent has been purged
from the important circle of
policy makers, and the Pres-
ident now has his consensus

The danger of this para-

noia should be evident to
anyone moderately interest-.
ed in the functioning of his
government. The semantic
hanky-panky of which the
J o h n s on administrtaion 1S
guilty has accomplished an
impressive redeﬁnition of
terms: patriotism becomes
agreement, Americanism be-
comes super-nationalism, dis-
sent becomes cowardice, or
worse,’ treachery. All those
who dare confront the Pres-
ident on the War issue are
met with the crudest bar-

. rage of demagogic sophistry.

Anyone in the position to ef-
fect policy decisions who ex-
hibits the integrity and cour-
age to criticize the methods
employed in the Vietnamese
War is subtly, but nonthe-
less decisively, silenced.
The stimulating effect up-

on decision-making of criti—.

cism has been disregarded.
The invaluableness of reeval-
uation, reanalysis, of “tak-
ing another look” . at ' policy
has been ignored. The dis-
senters have been removed
or maligned. And the deﬁni-
tion of patriotism has been
distortedso to include this
process. '
THAT THE tenacity with
which the administration

clings to its war policy hints ,

of desperation, that the crass
ibuse it hurls at its critics
iuggests the arrogance of

e .

And as a last note, it might
be pointed out that the sun,

luminating.

ON OCTOBER 21, the list
of allocations made by the Al-
locations Committee (Alcom)
appeared in the Pitt News.
Alcom had initially turned
down MDC’s request for
funds for a Dorm Weekend
for the University commun-

'ity. Many -small organiza-

tions 'received $0 with the
exception of the William Pitt
Debating Union (WPDU)
and Heinz Chapel Choir. The
article summed up the ma-
jor criterion used by Alcom
with a quote by Richard
Thuss, an Alcom member:
“We look very selﬁshly to

I see what will beneﬁt the stu-
dents who pay the activities
fee.” This statement seemed
in complete disagreement
with the facts.

It didn’t take long for the
student body to ﬁnd out that
MDC wanted the money for
a free Lettermen concert
while WPDU was to spend
the majority of its $3,700 to
send two debators to Great
Britain. Also the majority of
the $3,000 allocated to the
Heinz Chapel Choir was to
be spent to send them on
their Spring Concert Tour.
No doubt everyone wonder-
ed liow sending two debators
to Great Britain was going
to “beneﬁt the students”
more than a free Lettermen
concert.

Alcom has no deﬁned cri-
teria by which to judge the
allocations requests. Present-
ly they ai'e using what they
consider to be the only valid
criteria available and that
is the “merit of the pro-
gram.” By that is meant how
well the program is planned
and how well the request is
written as judged by the
committee. The number of
students affected receives
secondary consideration.
This is because, as a member
of Alcom explained to me,.
membership of organizations
overlap and using the num-
ber of students involved as
a main criteria would prove
misleading. Also the num-
ber of students engaged in
an activity is not a true

gauge of its worth to the’

student body. In otherwords
sending 2,000 students to a
free Lettermen concert does
not necessarily beneﬁt the

, student body more than send-

ing two debators to Great

    ‘ll

cations list makes more
sense. MDC didn’t receive

funds at ﬁrst because their‘ "
. request was not well-writ-_

ten. WPDU and Heinz Chap-
el Choir each received an al-
location because they gave

Alcom a well written request

for a “meritorious” program.

‘It's as simple as that.

But how valid is the cri-

’ teria that Alcom is now. us-

ing? Their criteria enables
small organizations to com-
pete successfully for funds
with the largest organiza-
tions on campus and this is
good. But it also enables
small organizations to walk
off with a much higher dol-
lars— to—member ratio than
larger organizations.

If the requests were judged
equally on the basis of the
“merit of the program” as
well as the number of stu-
dents involved, I think the
money would be distributed
more fairly. Thus large or-
ganizations wouldn’t always
get most of the money just
because they have a large

membership, and yet small’ ‘

organizations wouldn’t get
huge sums of money just be-
cause they submitted a well-
written request.

THERE IS‘also the prob-
lem of information. A sim-
ple .list of the alloctaions
published in the Pitt News
is misleading. The students
doii’t know what the organi-
zations who received money

"are going to do with it. The

only way they can ﬁnd out
is to attend the Student Gov-
ernment (SG) meeting where
the Alcom report is given.
Since it’s the student’s mon-
ey which is being spent, they
deserve a complete explana-

tion printed in The Pitt News 

along with the list of ap-

proved allocations, or a

WPGH broadcast of the SG
nleetlng where the report is
given would suffice.
There_ is also a lack of
communication between A1-
com and the organizational

heads who submit allocations -

1'€qU€S_tS._ All organizations
submitting requests are
aware that Alcom may re.
quest an interview with them

but few organizations are.

aware that they may de-
mand an interview with A].
com. Such person-to—person
contact is often needed.

Letters to the Editor

Stevens’ Lawv er Attacks Frick Editorial

Editor, The Pitt News:

In a recent issue of The Pitt
News you devoted your leading
front page story to an interview
with David B. Buerger, attorney
for Miss Helen Clay Frick in her
injunction suit against Dr. Sylves-
ter K. Stevens, who for 19 years
(1937-1956) served as State His-
torian of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania and is now, and
for the past ten years has been,
the _executive director of the
Pennsylvania Historical and Mu-
seums Commission.

The objective of this suit is to
suppres (via a court injunction)
Dr. Stevens’ book, Pennsylvania
—Birthplace of a Nation, simply
because Miss Frick questions the
accuracy of some of Dr. Stevens’

‘ statements dealing with her fa-

ther, Henry Clay Frick, and his
role in the Homestead Strike of
1892. In your only editorial in
that issue you indicated consi-
derable sympathy for Miss Frick’s
lawsuit.

May I respectfully request that
you devote comparable space to
the real issue involved—namely,
the freedom to write and to pub-
lish. '

No one contests Miss Frick’s
right or her ﬁlial duty, if she so
regards it, to publish or ﬁnance

v the publication of any informa-

tion she wishes about her late
father or his activities of 74 years
ago. Every day sees the publica-
tion of ‘books, articles, or other

A material concerning historic ﬁg-

ures, adding newly discovered in-
formation, reappraising old infor-
mation, correcting errors, adding
new insights, and so forth. To
distort this legitimate right of
free expression into a right to
suppress a book or any other pub-
lication is to create the very ar-
gument which dictators and to-
talitarian societies ﬁnd so ap-
pealing.

I ﬁnd it unbelievable that the
student publication of a distin-
guished university would make
the editorial statement: “It is the
duty of our society to provide
legal means by which authors
can be stopped from making un-
founded and malicious state-
ments . . .” What “A” may re-
gard as “unfounded” and “ma-
licious” “B” may regard as well
founded and worthy. Who de-
cides? Is this for judges, good or
bad, to determine?

History is full of controversial
personalities and if 74 years after
the event Mr. Frick’s daughter is
allowed to take legal action to
persuade a judge to suppress a
book about her father we may be
faced with attempts by Alexan-

der Hamilton's relatives, or
Aaron Burr’s relatives, or War-
ren Harding’s relatives, or Wil-
liam Penn’s relatives to seek out
judges who could be persuaded
to review the “accuracy” of what
has been written about their an-
cestors. Can you imagine the
congestion in our courts if they
became tribunals for the vertiﬁ-
cation of historical writings?

In short, your editorial treat-
ment of Miss Frick’s lawsuit re-
ﬂects an extraordinary insensitiv-
ity to one of the major issues of
our time. If her lawsuit is per-
mitted to continue, it would es-
tablish the totalitarain doctrine
that any man or woman, in-
cluding, of course, political per-
sonalities, could try to suppress
anything written about him or
her or his or her ancestors which
a judge “decided” was inaccur-
ate — even 74 years after the
event where there are no living
witnesses. At the very least, an
injunction suit could be started
which in effect would hopelessly
impede historical writing by cost,
expense and delay. Miss Frick
has not yet sought an injunction
pendente lite (i.e., during the
pendency of the litigation) but if
her right to an injunction after
a trial is recognized the request
for a pendente lite injunction
would surely follow in the next
lawsuits of this type.

Never before in the history of
the United States, as far as I
know, has any person, impor-
tant or unimportant, rich or poor,
politically popular or unpopular,
been allowed to suppress the
publication of a book through the
dubious device of a libel-injunc-
tion suit. It is elementary law, of
course, that the reputation of in-

dividuals must be protected, and
for hundreds of years the remedy
for the protection of an individ-
ual’s reputation has been a civil
suit for libel, the remedy for
which is monetary damages as-
sessed by a jury. Money dam-
ages is a very different remedy
than suppression.

The social-legal theory, of
course, is that any attmept to
suppress publication is censor-
ship and that in the subtle inter-
relationships of our social Or-
ganism, a free society must be
protected in its right to dissem-
inate information and to speak
and publish freely. The only way
in which this can be done is to
impose no restrictions on a free
press and, as a corollary libel
for money damages.

Every history book of any con-
sequence dealing with the history
of the United States in the 1890’s,
the coal and coke industry, labor
relations and the like, has some-
thing to say about Henry Clay
Frick. Millions of -words have

been written about hirn—some
are‘ favorable, others are very
critical. Some historians stress
particular aspects of his career
and select the factual information
about the times which they re-
gard as most meaningful; others
stress different data and reach
other conclusions.

The art of history is a subtle
and selective process as every
writer and editor knows. The
need for selectivity is perhaps
most illustrated by McCauley’s
famous statement that it would
take a man a lifetime totally to
report everything he saw, did
or thought in a single day. To
give any person, whether or not

worthily motivated, the right*toV

suppress by an injunction suit
historical comments about a long
deceased ancestor is the most
ﬂagrant of all possible violations
of the right of free speech and

of a free press.

In the meantime, may I com-
mend you for your recognition

of the newsworthiness of Miss
Frick’s suppression suit. May I
urge upon you the importance
of a distinguished university
newspaper doing evrything with-
in its editorial power to preserve
and protect the American tradi-
tion of every man being able to‘
speak and write freely about his-
tory (and, of course, on every
other subject) without the threat
of suppresion by injunction or
the need to justify his historical
writings before any course.
Sincerely,
Alexander Hehmeyer

By Ticket Plans

Editor, The Pitt News:

This year,‘ for the ﬁrst time,
the Homecoming plans are great,
but the insigniﬁcant number of
students that will be able to par-
ticipate will make Homecoming
week-end like every other week- , _
end at Pitt—DEAD!, Every single '
aspect of the sale of Homecoming
tickets was handled poorly! Our
most obvious objection: it had
" been announced in the Pitt News

that tickets would be sold from
11 a.m. to 8 p.m. When we ar-
rived at 10:45, we were informed
that every ticket had been sold.

If making a list was the most
efficient way of selling the tick-
ets, the list should have been
started at 11——the announced
time. Any private lists that had
been started prior to the desig-
nated time should have been
completely disregarded by the
Homecoming Committee. Not ev-
ery student thinks in terms of
undermining a system—and the
Homecoming Committee, those

7 who arranged the system of sale,

“ should have abided by their orig-
inal decision. Those.of us who
patiently tried to cooperate with
their plan were disappointed be-
cause the committee chose to ac-
commodate’ those students who
decided to set up their own sys-
tems for obtaining tickets.

This “each man for himself”
grabbing was unfortunate and un-
fair, but almost understandable
in View of the limited tickets
available. Nine hundreds tickets
for thousands of students is in-
excusable! Every student who
wants to attend his Homecoming
should be able to and should not
have to lower himself to a de-
grading level in order to get a
ticket. Every student is required
to pay an activities fee-—part of
that moneys goes to Homecom-
ing—-—and, therefore, every stu-
dent should be able to beneﬁt
from this money. While we must»
all support Homecoming ﬁnan-
cially, we are not given the choice
of supporting it by our presence.

  

If more money is needed for
. /' larger facilities, we feel that the
students would be willing to pay
the difference. Provisions for ac-
commodating more students at
all of the Homecoming events
must be made if the Homecom-
ing Committee wants to consider
themselves successful!

Four Hr. Meters
Needed at Pitt

Editor, The Pitt News:

In the interest of a more proﬁt-
"',* able City Government I would
like to offer a few suggestions for
revision of the parking regula-

tions in the Pitt campus area.
I think the idea of four-hour

meters in the Oakland area is ab-
surd. Instead of offering students
the opportunity of parking for
four hours at a time, why not
change the time limit to 45 min-
utes. This would give our lovely
meter maids the opportunity of
ﬁlling their quotient of tickets
much earlier in the month.

In fact, why not have street
Cleaning every day of the week
from 7 am. to 4 p.m.? After all,
the same amount of cleaning
would be done and the tickets
would more than pay for the
cost of the signs?

At Ford Motor Company were always breaking
molds. . . when we find a better way to accomplish
our objectives. If you like the idea of finding better
ways, want to apply your imagination to the sort of
problems that haven’t even been facedtill now—you
might be our kind of man!

You know, of course, we build cars and trucks

we design new ones. We're involved with space prob-

lems, ways of improving TV sets, and even a special

“Another Day

1|!!!

Bazylak Seeks Longo,
But He Wasn’t There

By Tom Sacks
Sports Editor

Ilﬂlllll-Illllll

Bob Bazylak was scamper_ing around the backfield Sat-
urday looking for an open receiver. His eyes focused first
on Skip Orszulak, then on Dave Montrella, and finally on

Frank Hartz.

Baz, a junior, hadn’t played quarterback since he was a
freshman. Having only practiced for a week at the now un-
familiar backfield spot, he wasn’t that sure of either his

receivers or their favorite patterns. Ironically, the only .

person he would have felt at ease with had left the game

before Baz entered.

That person is B-ob Longo, who had been Baz’s favorite
receiver in the Big 33 victory over Texas three years ago.
As freshmen the two had also linked up rather successfully.

“I felt really bad about not being able to help Bob out,”
saidlLong0. “I wanted to be in there a lot.”

But Longo, who is the Panthers’ top receiver this year,
had no choice about his inactivity in the second half against
Syracuse. He was sitting on the bench not because of an

injury but because of the coaches.

Dave Hart wrote it all off by saying, “We benched
Longo because he just wasn’t running his patterns right.”

From the way Hart explained it, it sounded as if Longo
didn’t know or didn’t care about his patterns. Since this
was the same athlete who had caught 11 passes in the UCLA
game for a new Pitt record, the coaches must have been a
little less than cool and collected when they made their de-

cision.

“What can I say,” said Longo. “I ran the wrong pattern
when that Syracuse guy ran back the interception for a

touchdown and the coaches
got mad. They were all right
and I was all wrong.” '\

Bob is probably one of the
best professional prospects
among this year’s crop of
Panthers, but somehow he
always seems to get in trou-
ble with his tutors. His ﬁrst
big mistake came as a fresh-
man when he told someone
that he hates to block. The
information reached the
Michelosen coaching staff
and from that point on they
were constantly on his back.

“I always say that the
only difference between me
and the other guys is that I
admit what I don’t like,”
says Longo. “If I kept my
big mouth shut I guess I
would never have gotten into
trouble.

His blocking got him into
trouble in fall camp this year
and with a new coaching
staff. ‘‘I didn’t make _my
blocks downﬁeld one day, so
they put me on the second
team the next day,” recalls
Longo.

“I realize I’m not a devas-
tating blocker, but I don’t
mind it when I have to. My
only objection was against
playing tight end which I’m
not. So I guess I don’t have
any gripes.”

Bob might ‘not have any
gripes this year, but Hart
apparently had one at Syra-
cuse. The Panther offense
isn’t that potent as it is and
without Longo as a threat
it is meek. If the coaches
hope to present a respect-
able offense at Notre Dame
Saturday, it is a necessity
that Bazylak have his favor-
ite receiver back running
patterns. ' P

BOB LONGO
In trouble again.

 

 

BOBBY DYER gets up to the minute instructions
from Coach Dave Hart during the loss to Navy

Wednesday, November 2, 1966 — THE PITT NEWS — Page 9

Bobby Dyer Quickly Realizes

Defense Is Really Promotion

earlier in the season. The Panther senior made the

by JAY ROSENSTEIN
It was a tired Bobby Dyer who left the field after the
loss to Syracuse. He -had a right to be tired. The defensive
unit had played nearly 45 minutes of a bruising football

game.

Not that this was any different
‘from every other game this sea-
son. The Panther defense spends

about as much time on the side- _

lines as Terry Hanratty spends
on his back. ' '

“We’re out there better than
35 minutes each game,” says Dy-
er. “And if they have 100 plays
to run against us, heck, one ‘of
them is going to work. When

they ﬁnd one, you can be sure‘

they’re going to keep it up.”

In order to stop Syracuse's run-
ning game, the Panther defense
frequently had eight men within
two yards of the ball. The strate-
gy paid off. “The secondary had
nothing to do in the second half,”
Dyer points out, “because the line
did the job in stopping the ball-
carriers.”

Dyer didn’t stand around and
look at the crowd, however. “We
still had to watch out for the.
pitch man (Floyd Little) and
their ends kept us busy?’

The secondary is kind of like
a revolving door for the players
who try to protect it. Each has
assignments that change from
game to game and often from
one play to the next. Dyer guard-
ed the outside or wide receivers
against the Orange.

“I found out last week that the
outside secondary man has a heck
of a lot of responsibility,” he-
says. “I’m used to watching the
quarterback all the time. Then all

of a. sudden somebody would zip
right by me and it would be all
over.”

It happened twice, once for a

touchdown and once for a 40
yard gain. Last year Dyer was
the one who did the zipping by
the defenders to haul in a Kenny
Lucas pass.
, As the starting halfback last
season, Dyer is the ﬁrst to admit
that the satisfaction of football
is on offense. “The prestige, the
drive to score makes offense the
object of every football player,”
he says.

When he heard at the begin-
ning of the fall.that he had been
switched to defense, Dyer consi-
dered it a demotion‘. But his mind
changed quickly. He found that
defense was easier on him phy-
sically.

“When you play defense you’re
essentially hitting one man,”‘he
explains. “But on oﬁense, more
than one man hits you all the
time. I'm thankful I’m not play-
ing there now..Those guys are
getting belted.”

Dyer worked with the offense
after Dewey Chester got hurt
earlier in the season. He got to
play a little offense against Cali-
fornia in addition to his regular
defensive duties. And he wasn’t
pleased with either performance.

“Boy, I don’t think there’s a
player in the country who could
go both ways anymore,” Dyer

 

shift from offensive halfback to
fanfare and without difficulty.

 

ék

cornerback withoﬁt

It takes a worried man.
DEFENSIVE BACK

emphasizes. “Specialization makes
it virtually impossible. It’s not
that offense or -defense are terri-
bly complicated by themselves
but learning both together is
something else. And a guy gets
tired enough playing one way.”

Dyer’s exactly where he wants
to be. On a “stacked” defense
and happy to be a part of a tough
unit despite the lopsided playing
time.

All—American N aponick Refused Brother, Va.,
Found Defensive End Assignment Waiting Here

by ROY JACOBS

Usually a- high school foot-
ball player who receives nine-
ty or a hundred college foot-
ball offers can dictate where
he’s going and where he will
play after he gets there.
Freshman Paul Naponick dictated.
where he was going alright, but
he hasn’t had too much to say

about where he’s playing since
he got here.

Paul played offensive end and
linebacker at Norwin High where"
he gained honors ranging from

All-Foothills to All-American and

- 6 s-

 

 

Big 33. He was recruited as a
linebacker and tight end, but
he’s spent his freshman season
‘so far at defensive end.

“I wasn’t too happy about it,”
Paul reflects, “but I want to play,
and I’ll do the best I can.

“Actually it all depends where
they needlyou. I’m not really
worried about it.” His coach,
Steve Petro, agrees.

“I don’t really know what the
coaches have planned for him
next year,” said Petro, “but I
needed him at defensive end.'Po-
tentially, he has what the coach-
es look for. But there’s no ques-
tion in my mind, and I. think in

 

  

his too, that there’s a lot for him
to learn.” Petro also hopes to
uses Naponick offensively this
year, and Paul has been practic-
ing at tight end lately.

“My main problem at defen-
sive end is being outside consci-
ous, anticipating reverses and
sweeps. I want to go inside af-
ter the ball.” Maybe somewhere
else he would have had the op-
portunity.

Naponick had a lot of some-
where elses to choose from. He
turned down Michigan State, No-
tre Dame, UCLA, and others while
narrowing his choice to two-
Pitt and Virginia.  * *

A He came here because “there’s
better football here. Also, for the

and I thought the city would

INTRAMURAL touch football was fast and furious ‘last week. The

gglo _   Nigyys ~_EWednesday, .Novemberi2,l 1966:

Sigma Chi Takes Lead  
In “A” League Football;

dorms, frats and independents all swung into action.
by JAY KAPLAN
Intramural fraternity touch football was at it again
last Monday as Phi Epsilon Pi swamped Sigma. Alpha Mu,
39-0. Sig Chi overpowered Pi Lam, 18-0, and Delta _Tau

Delta narrowly beat Zeta Beta Tau, 19-6, in overtime. _
Perennially powerful Phi Ep, bouncing back after losing its first
game, could not be stopped by the Sammies. Danny Friedman, the

Phi Ep quarterback,. continually riddled the Sammie defense as he -

threw five touchdown passes.

Sandy Warren caught three of the five TD passes and Rick Abrams
the other two in the 39-0 whitewashing. With this victory, Phi Ep stays

in contention in “A” league with
a 1-1 record.

The Delta Tau Delta»-ZBT game
was a real thriller. The Zeebs
scored first on a Steve Mercer
pass to Tom Geiger to take the
lead. After this score both teams
played tight defensive ball until
the last quarter.

With one minute remaining in
‘the game with the score still 6-0
in favor of the Zeebs, Jim Dock-
ey, DTD quarterback, ran for a
touchdown to tie up the game.
With the extra point attempt fail-
ing, the game was forced into
‘overtime. In the overtime period
it was all Delta Tau Delta as Don
Frazina and Jim Materna scored
touchdowns to lead the Delts to
a 19-6 win.

The battle for ﬁrst place in
“A” league turned into an easy
18-0 victory as Sig Chi shutout Pi
Lamb, 18-0. It was Sigma Chi’s
third straight win.

Pete Keler was the ﬁrst man to
cross the goal line when he caught
Sig Chi quarterback Jim Daniel’s
TD pass in the second quarter.
Dave Wiesma also caught a touch-
down pass for Sig Chi. The high-
light of the game was Ralph Man-
ning’s 60 yard kick off return
touchdown which made the score
12-0 at the end of the third per-
iod. Pi Lam was never able to
catch up as the Si Chi defense
held them to only two ﬁrst downs
the whole game.

In the independent league, the
69ers crushed MBA, 22-62 to re-
main in ﬁrst place with two wins
and no losses.

Frosh Boot
Team a Meets

Akron ].V.’s

“A tie is like kissing your sis-
ter,” goes an old sports adage. If
this is true, then freshman soccer
should be charged with incest.
For in ﬁve games, the frosh boot-
ers have tied three times, the
latest being a scoreless tie with
West Virginia last Saturday.

Although disappointed with the
ties, frosh coach George Sommer
is not disheartened by the play
of his team. “In all three of those
games,” says Sommer, “we’ve
had our chances, but haven’t
taken advantage of them.

“In the two ties with Slippery
Rock, we had the shots but miss-
ed them. Against West Virginia,
we had the openings but didn’t
take the shots. But, the boys have
really played well, and I can’t
say I’m disappointed in them."

The frosh get their ﬁnal test
of this season this Saturday,
when they will meet the Akron
JV’s prior to the varsity’s game
with Akron.

_ worst record since 1903 team

 

— for 53 yards and one touchdown.

by GEORGE LIES

Like the hard luck gambler
awaiting that one good streak,
the Panthers face the country’s
hottest card dealer in Notre Dame
Saturday. And coach Dave Hart
wishes he had an ace in the hole.

With the prospects of meeting
the nation's number one team,
Hart can’t say much in regard to
this year’s edition of -the Pan-
thers, who are on the way to the

which lost eight games and tied
one. -

Even the 1947 and 1950 teams
won one of nine games, but this
season the Panthers chances of
ﬁnishing 1-9 are very probable.
After the Irish, they face the un-
derrated Hurricances of Miami
(4-2) and the much-improved
Nittany Lions of Penn State (4-3).

“I was tremendously encour-
aged by our defensive play against
Syracuse,” Hart said. In the third
quarter, the" Orangemen man-
aged only one. ﬁrst down and
were held to their lowest game
rushing total, 104, of the season.
Three players, Jim Flanigam, Greg
Keller, and Tippy Pohl - earned
“Panther Pack” awards for their
defensive effort. Flanigan gained
his fourth blue star for his hel-
met; Keller his second.

Hart has “rewarded” junior
Bob Bazylak the ﬁrst string quar-
terback position since Ed James
is still a doubtful starter for the
Notre Dame game. S
" Playing only the second half
against Syracuse last week, Bazy-
lak completed seven of 14 passes

His one scoring toss went to
sopohomore Frank Hartz, whom
Hart plans to start ahead of sen-
ior Mickey Rosborough at tight

if  . ...,~

strategy, his team still must con-
tend with a powerhouse in Indi-
ana Saturday.

_ “W959 Playing the best team

In college football,” Hart said,

“And the odds couldn’t be much
m0"? against us.

For the season. Rosborough’s
22 receptions for 246 yards is sec-
ond only to Bob Longo who has
caught 34 aerials for 467 yards
and three touchdowns.

,3 Student Union Offers 
Grand Tour of Europ.e

by BERNI MCLEOD
For less than one term’s
tuition for an out-of-state

student, University mem-

be1's may take a Grand Tour
ofEurope, under the Student
Union’s program: European
Holiday . . . 1967.

From April 22 until May 20,
1967, tour members will be vis-
iting England, the Netherlands,
Germany, Austria, Italy, France,
Switzerland, and Belgium. Peo-
ple interested in seeing Europe
without a tour, may take advan-
tage of just the round trip group
rate air fare between New York
and Manchester.

The Tour was organized for
the ﬁrst time last year. John R.
Loch, director of the Student
Union, served as Tour director
and plans to do the same this
year.

Linda Kafel, a graduate stu-
dent under the School of Educa-

tion’s Internship Program, ‘was
one of the University students
to take the tour lastyear.

_ “I saw everything I wanted to
see,” said Miss Kafel, “especially
for a ﬁrst trip to Europe. We vis-
ited the typically famous cities
and got to see outstanding art
and architecture, especially in
Italy.”

Lynne Townsend, another Tour
member, and an English litera-
ture major from Murraysville,
Pa., felt that the Tour was “real-
ly worthwhile.”

“Even under the guided pro-
gram,” said Miss Townsend, “we
had time to meet people, al-
though the Tour isn’t really de-
signed to expose Europe in depth
Iwerything went smoothly and
all the major problems were
taken care of. I can’t wait to go
back.”

Information pamphlets about
the Tour may be obtained at the
old magazine rack by the SU
desk.

Edgar Lewis, a custodian at the
University’s Falk Experimental
School for the past 14 years, was
honored with a retirement party
Monday for his service to the
University. At the time of his
retirement, at the age of 65, Lew-
is had spent more years on the
custodial staff at the University
than any other man. He began

his service here 39 years ago.
The party was sponsored by
parents and teachers connected
with Falk, where Lewis worked.
He remarked at a school-wide

that he “very much enjoyed work-
ing in the University and meeting
all the children at Falk School.”
Lewis is seen above with his wife.

Young Democrats

A national student effort
to actively support the cam-
paigns of 30 freshmen Demo-
cratic congressmen has been
organized by the College
Democrats Club of , America
(CYDCA) announced Na-
tional Chairman Dale E. Wagner.
‘ “Through active student cam-
paign committees and ﬁnancial
contributions, we hope -to help
these freshmen Democrtic con-
gressmen return to Congress next
January,” Wagner stated. “Their
votes and progressive outlook are
necessary to the 90th Congress
if the social and economic goals
of the Great Society are to be
realized.”

Wagner criticized the Republic-
an Party’s “attempt to substitute
the ‘almighty Buck’ in the cam-
paign for the Democratic Party’s
positive programs of action dur-
ing the last six years.” He point-
ed out that ‘this Democratic Con-
gress has a record of forward
looking legislation in the ﬁelds
of education, urban development,
and human rights. Today,‘ there
are more scholarships available
for students than ever before un-
der the expanded National De-
fense Education Act and the

“We want to see this progress
continued,” Wagner emphasized.
"We want to see this group of
freshmen ‘Democratic congress-
men returned, for it is they who
have provided the margin neces-
sary to enact the President’s pro-
grams.”

W. Gary Winget, executive sec-
retary of the CYDCA, comment-
ed, “The national organization
does not have the funds or man-
power to support all ‘those Demo-
cratic candidates who deserve it.
However, local College Young

Democratic clubs will be actively
engaged with the candidates in
canvassing precincts, handing out
literature, and helping students
register and vote by absentee bal-
lot.”

all full-time Liberal Arts stu-“
dents, nurses, and engineers
would be eligible to participate
in a “Gold and Blue Day” at Pitt
Stadium. The women would wear
gold derbies and the men, blue.

As students crusade in

\'Civil Rights and anti-War

demonstrations, one Univer-
sity faculty member is de-
fending his own cause — a
Committee to abolish Var-
sity Football. Vigdor Kava-

ler, economics lecturer, is cur-
rently in the process of prepar-
ing a petition and organizing a
meeting to promote his commit-
tee. ‘
"‘Instead of having the stu-
dents tormented with a losing
football team and the faculty and

‘ administration - tormented with

the ethics of replacing football
coaches, we could tear down the
stadium and construct the play-
ing ﬁelds of Eton,” Kavaler pro-

-- posed.

Kavaler insisted he was an avid
football fan, having missed ﬁve
home games in 21 years. “Things
have come to such a state that I
have concluded we should abol-
ish varsity football,” he announc-

 ed regretfully.

As an alternative to his pro-

“Both the men and the wom-
en have to get one another's
derbies by fair or foul means,
then bring them back to their
respective goal lines,” Kavaler
explained. “What this might do
is to generate spirit; surely, it
would mix up the student body.

“Assuming the men win, each
man who participates gets a
prize from the Dean of Women’s
oifice~—80O minutes with the girl
of his choice. It doesn’t have to
be with the same girl on the
same evening,” Kavaler allowed.
“It can be allocated over the
course of the school year.

When asked about administra-
tive approval, Kavaler empha-
sized, “The students can do it o_n
their own. They can force their

Christian Religious Groups
Unite to Form Federation

For the ﬁrst time on Ameri-
can campuses, students have put
together a major religious organi-
zation taking in all major Chris-
tian denominations.

Last month in Chicago, the Na-
tional Student Christian Federa-
tion (NSCF), formerly composed
of the Protestant student move-
ments and the Y’s, was dissolved
and replaced by the University
Christian Movement (UCM), now
composed of Protestants, Roman
Catholics, Orthodox, and Young
Friends. E

The charter members of the

UCM at the national level are:

Baptist Student Movement, the
Campus Commission of the Stand-
ing Conference of Orthodox Bish-
ops in the Americas, the Luther-
an Student Association of Ameri-
ca, the Methodist Student Move-
ment, the National Canterbury
Committee, the National Federa-
tion of Catholic College Students,
the National Newman Student
Federation, the National Student
‘Young Women’s Christian Asso-
citaion, the United Campus Chris-
tian Fellowship and Westminis-
ter Fellowship, and the Young
Friends of North America. The
new organization offers incent-
ives to campuses where students
are engaged in uniting without
reference to denominational lines
on issues of interest to the uni-
versity as a whole. ’
The UMC will be a meeting
place for students and groups

' who are questioning social and

moral issues such as: the univer-

- sity’s role in the community, the

student's part in civil rights,

peace and justice in the world,
and vocational decisions which
reﬂect society's needs.

Since local groups of the UCM
are not forced to relate to a na-
tional or regional body, each
campus decides the course its
own chapter will take.

UCM, write to: University Chris-
tian Movement, Room 757, 475

The administration couldn't re-

Kavaler's purpose for forming
his committee is‘ “the delight of
seeing students accomplish some-
thing.” He proposed to launch
his committee the Monday fol-
lowing the Pitt-Penn State game.
Even those who aren’t convinced
may take that time for reassess-
ment of varsity football. He sug-
gested the main dining room of
Webster Hall as a possible meet-
ing place. ‘

Although he is engrossed with
his Committee—to Abolish Varsity
Football, Kavaler is already plan-
ning his next project—a search
to ﬁnd an “Official Campus Jes-
ter.”
