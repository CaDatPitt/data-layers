Pitt Writers’Conference Revived  

Halberstam, Kinnell, 

Highlight Revival

By SETH LUBOVEV

Writers, editors, poets, and
publishers——perhaps the largest
and most prestigious collection of
literary figures in the history of the
university—will come together for
the revival of the nationally-
reknowned University of Pitts-
burgh Writers’ Conference after a
four-year hiatus.

Scheduled for Saturday and Sun-
day, Mar. 20 and 21 in the Frick
Fine Arts Building, the conference
“Aspects of Professionalism VI,”
features Pulitzer Prize-winning
journalist David Halberstam,
author of "The Best and the
Brightest” and “The Powers That
Be,” and poet Galway Kinnell, the
recipient of the 1975 Award of
Merit Medal for poetry from the
American Academy of Arts and
Letters and author of “MortalActs,
Mortal Words.” Halberstam will
speak and Kinnell will give a read-
ing at a special Saturday night pro-
gram at Carnegie Lecture Hall.

Also appearing at the conference
are novelists John Wideman and

Barry Hannah. Wideman, one of
America’s leading black writers, is
a native of Pittsburgh’s Home-
wood district and is a former
Rhodes scholar now teaching Eng-
lish at the University of Wyoming.
Hannah, who was nominated for
the National Book Award and
awarded the William Faulkner
Prize for his first novel “Geronimo
Rex,” is also the author of ,“Ray”
and “Airships.” Poet Carolyn
Forche, winner of the LaMont
Prize given by the Academy of
American Poets, will also be read-
ing from her work.

In addition, there will be three
panel discussions: “Selling What
You Write,” featuring literary
agent Ellen Levine, Rolling Stone
magazine editor Terry McDonnell,
and Jane Rosenman, an editor at
E.P. Dutton, Inc. publishers;
“Women in Publishing” with Jeff
Schwartz of Alice James Press, the
women’s publishing co-op, Janet
Sternberg, editor of “The Writer
and Her Work” and program
officer for the New York Council

and nonathletic event, the occa-
sion is almost by definition an
important one.-The debate last
Thursday evening between Cal
Thomas and Birch Bayh had
the potential for a serious clash
of ideas about the state of the
American Republic in 1982.
While the crowd had its share
of cranks and blowhards, most
members of the audience
awarded the speakers a civil
reception. The largest segment

of the audience had come to
listen and learn. Some two
hours later, after the speeches,
counter-responses, questions
and answers, the audience
heard much but learned per-
haps too little. What they did
learn was probably more about
the speakers themselves than
the complicated and explosive
issues that currently divide the
country.

Cal Thomas is an energetic,
articulate and effective spokes-

man for the Moral Majority. He
identifies well the current fears
and frustrations that exist
among a powerful segment of
the nation, people who have
seen their traditional values and
institutions threatened by the
events of the past two decades.

Doubtlessly, most Americans
who lend their allegiance to the
Moral Majority are decent peo-
ple who pay their taxes, raise

DeLuca: Outlook
for Aid Gloomy

By LAURIE MacLEOD

“Gloomy” was the word Student
Government Board President
.Todd DeLuca used at Friday’s SGB
meeting to describe the effects of
federal budget cuts on student aid.

DeLuca traveled to Harrisburg
last week to participate in a state-
wide conference on the budget cuts.
He said the American Council on
Higher Education issued a report
containing these facts on the stu-
dent aid crunch:

0 Over 3.3 million students
receive aid from at least one of the
grant programs.

0 Over 3.5 million students
receive guaranteed loans.

0 At least half of the post-
secondary enrollment receives
somes form of federal assistance.

0 Guaranteed student loans will
be totally eliminated in the course
of three years

0 Reduction of college work-
study funding will eliminate
250,000 students that were eligible
in 1981

0 Elimination of certain grants
would reduce the chance for stus

dents to attend the college of their
choice

DeLuca said these e(hanges will
directly affect the uni ersities and
types of students that attend
college. J

“For the first time I realize how
serious these cuts really are,” he
said.

An “impact report” showing
budget cut effects on Pitt will be
sent to SGB.

Chip Roth, liaison to the
Governmental Relations Commit-
tee, said the committee currently
does not have a strong voice nor
direct channel to the governor, but
is actively looking for ways to
achieve both.

“Then we can speak for students
on how they are being affected,” he
said.

Concerning teaching evalua-
tions, Deihuea said he received cor-
respondence regarding mandatory
teacher evaluations from 10 univer-
sities and colleges. “It seems man-

datory teacher evaluations are a

nation-wide problem and goal

By JEFF RUSSELL

“A nuclear war would make

5-Vietnaim look like a Sunday school

picnic,” warned Sam Day, former
editor of Progressive magazine,
during a speech Thursday before
two arilti-nuclear groups.

Day preceded his speech to Pitt’s
Arms Race Study Group and
Mobilization For Survival with a
film about the protests at the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin during the
Vietnam era, entitled The War At
Home.

“They were speaking the truth,
and weren’t listening-this phrase
from the last line of the film could
be as aptly applied to the current
version of the anti-war move-
ment," Day said.

The protests of the 60s and 705,
though bringing “only a cosmetic
solution” to the war, provide inspi-
ration for the protestors of today,
according to Day.

Day said that although the moti-
vations of the 605 (the vested inter-
est caused by daft eligibility) and
the war prob1;.h are not as visible
today as they were then, they are
still present.

According to him, the U.S. is
making an “invisible preparation
for nuclear war.”

Dazy also noted that university
(‘involvement with the military is
‘got as apparent now as it was dur-

ing the Vietnam era.

“Then universities were directly
involved in the making of wea-
pons, such as napalm," he said.
“Now the cooperation is much
more danderous and is much less
more dangerous and is much less
is a high technology war and that
technology comes from our col-
leges and universities, cooperation

has increased and has become more
dangerous.”

In order to fight the threat of
nuclear war, Day said it is most
important to get to the roots of
nuclear war.

“We have to find the tools to
fight this growing danger of war,”
Day said. “We each should have a
little revolution in our head so that
we can try to make a revolution in
the larger society.”

According to Day, this revolu-
tion involves our concept of
national defense and national
security. He said he believes that
the real threats to national security
are “our own internal contradic-
tions; our own propensity to des-
troy the very society in which we
live” along with “our failure (to
realize) that only after we change
our priorities from defense to
‘human needs can we begin to make
a better society.”

“Europe’s increased awareness
and (its) arising from slumber is
encouraging,” Day said, adding
that he sees Europe’s peace move-
ments and its rebellions against
nuclear weapons abetting similar
movements in this country.

Day concluded the speech por-
tion of his appearance with the
question: “Do we have the time to
spread this resistance before it's too
late?"

During a discussion with the
audience, Day stated that there are
several watchdog groups investi-
gating military research on U.S.
campuses. Day said that he believes
Pitt is undertaking very little mil-
itary research at the moment, while
Carnegie-Mellon appears to him to
be very much involved in war-
related research.

For his audience, made up

mostly of educators, Day had this
advise:

Residents

By LINDA MlLLE_R

Pitt’s proposal to expand and
upgrade its Boundary Street park-
ing lot has a few South Oakland
residents up in arms.

"My neighbors and I are sick and
tired of interference by the univer-
sity in a community where our
forefathers settled,” said Boundary
Street resident Robert Casciato at
last Thursday's meeting of Oak-
land Directions, Inc. (ODI). “We
will fight them all the way on this
one. The university isn’t God.” _

Casciato indicated that there is

_more at stake than the Boundary

Street lot, which will yield 80 park-
ing spaces.
“Who’s to say the university will
make good on its promises to
patrol and maintain the lot?” he
asked. “I heard that before in the
19605 and I haven't seen much
patroling or upkeepdown there
yezlccording to Casciato, the uni-
versity has done more harm than
good on Boundary Street. Among
otner things, he noted that the till
put on the former backfield of
Forbes has caused water drainage
problems in his neighborhood.
Both the university’s Boundary
Street and Bouquet Street lots
(located behind the Annex) are tar-
geted for expansion and paving in

sciousness of the academic com-
munity.”

Day concluded the evening with
a message to his audience.

“This is an unparalleled time in

the history of the world,” he said.
“It may be time to stop business as
usual. The urgency now is far more
critical than during the Vietnam

)!

era.

Reject Proposal

Tuesday for approval.

As part of Pitt’s plans for a new
$6.4 million Graduate School of
Business, the parking proposal is
necessary since zoning laws require
that Pitt provide 98 parking spaces

within I000 feet of the new three- I

story building, which is to be built
at Roberto Clemente Drive and
South Bouquet Street on property
that was formerly the outfield of
Forbes Field.

According to Senior Vice Chan-
cellor Jack Freeman, the university
cannot afford to put the parking
spaces indoors underneath the
building. In order to keep costs
down, the building will be pre-
engineered and economical if only
built on a slab.

“I’m sick and tired of hearing
Mr. Freeman say that Pitt doesn’t
have the money to build indoor
parking,” Casciato said. “Why
can’t Pitt abide by the zoning law?
The Boundary Street lotis illegal-—
there was never a hearing when a
permit was issued, and it hasn't
been renewed.”

Fred just, an official with the
city Planning Department, cor-
rected Casciato, saying that the
nature of the parking permit that
Pitt holds for the Boundary Street
lot is automatically renewed and
can only be dissolved if the lot lays
dormant for a year.

Jay Roling, Pitt Vice Chancellor
for Public Affairs and an ODI
board member, also noted that Cas-
ciato was incorrect in his charge
that Freeman waited until January
to make the parking proposal
known.

“According to the minutes I have
from the city Planning Commis-

sion's meeting on Nov. '18, Dr.
Freeman made a statement about
the parking proposal mentioning
each lot individually,” Roling
said.

Another ODI board member and
Oakland resident criticized the
ODI planning committee for
recommending Pitt’s parking
proposal.

“I’m against that ODI has not
pushed for indoor parking," she
said. “Parking has always been a
major problem and their proposal
offers little relief.”

According to ODI board member
Sandy Phillips, the ODI planning
committee approved the universi-
ty’s proposal on the following
grounds:

I Pitt must pave the two parking

lots, as well as provide lighting,
security, landscaping and upkeep
for them;
f Pitt must establish a sticker park-
ing program underwhich South
Oakland residents (including stu-
dents) would be issued stickers for
long-term street parking;

0 Pitt must assess the impact on
residential streets after the business

school opens.

nomic improvement, are chari-
table to their neighbor, love
their country and pay homage
to their God. But they are cur-
rently angry and frustrated and
the Moral Majority has pro-
vided an organized focus for
their fears.
Former Senator Bayh, by con-
trast, has become identified
with the changes that threaten
the stability of moral certainty
and the attractiveness of pat
answers. Liberal Democrats are
on the defensive these days as_
‘they see their elected numbers
on the decline along with many
of the assumptions that have
characterized much of the
nation since March 1933.

While one could be overly
dramatic about all this, it seems
reasonable to say that America
is at the crossroads where paths
taken now will lay foundations
for years to come. Similar
moments in the past have pro-
duced a Webster and a Hayne, a
Calhoun and_a Clay, a Lincoln
and a Douglas, a Bryan and a
Darrow. While Cal Thomas is

no Ayatollah Khomeini,.

neither is Birch Bayh a Daniel
Webster, the flattering intro-
duction by' the moderator
notwithstanding.

Too few issues were devel-
oped in this debate. Undoubt-
edly most members of the
audience would have declared
Birch Bayh the winner. His
calm Hoosier-s_tyle delivery, his
obvious enjoyment of the whole
event, his moderation and
obvious sincerity, his willing-
ness to remain long after the
official proceedings had ended,
his skillful handling of hostile
questions and his almost natu-
ral ability to identify with his
audience would all place him in
good stead with this academic
gathering.

Thomas, by contrast, was a

defensive, a little too brusque
and a little too jovial‘at the
wrong moments. While he too
is doubtless a man of good will,
his world view is too certain,
too clear and too pat.

Ever since the first Kennedy-
Nixon debate, when Nixon's
attempt to remove perspiration
from his brow communicated
nervousness and the wrong
color suit and bad makeup job
indicated paleness, we have a
tendency not to ask who won a
political debate but rather who
lost the encounter because of a
fatal error.

Gerald Ford made such an
error in 1976 when he declared
Poland an independent nation.

Jimmy Carter made a similar
error in 1980 when he told us
about Amy’s concern for
nuclear proliferation, setting
up a string of Johnny Carson
jokes that even found an
audience in the CBS profes-
sional football announcing
corps.

While no fatal errors took
place in this debate, one inter-
esting moment stood out that
said a great deal about these
speakers and indirectly about
the issues surrounding the
Moral Majority.

An articulate and sincere
young woman, herself a liberal,
could not understand how a
progressive senator with a
strong tradition of concern for
the underdog would not extend
similar compassion for the
unborn child. Her work in
anatomy had convinced her
that life began at the moment of
conception. She had struggled
with her own thinking and con-
cluded that abortion was
wrong. Thus she could not
understand Bayh’s opposition
to making abortions illegal.

Senator Bayh treated the
question and the questioner
with calmness. respect and

K

compassion. He described his
own internal struggleabout the
complicated issue and his ulti-
mate personal conclusion. He
felt he lacked the right to place
himself in the shoes of others.
He added that in his eighteen
years in the U.S. Senate, abor-
tion was the most difficult issue
he had to face in reconciling
moral choices.-

Cal Thomas, obviously refer-
ring to Bayh’s 1980. election
defeat, said with some glee that
he was pleased Bayh would no
longer have to face difficult
choices.

That remark by Thomas was
not only cutting and mean, but
was rhetorically stupid as the
loud chorus of jeers from the
audience indicated. What had

ing it, describing its ugly
moments and ultimately forc-
ing the excesses on the leader-

' 1sh_ipA_itself. Thomas could never

offer an effective rejoinder to
Bayh’s argument that at some
point the Moral Majority lead-
ership must accept responsibil-
ity for the statements and
strategies of its speakers.

Bayh also did an effective job
of defending tolerance as neces-
sary to a pluralistic society, that
one could disagree about means
while endorsing similar values
and that the lack of tolerance
could have dangerous repercus-
sions for the American system.

If Bayh had a weakness, it is
that he did not goifar enough.

been a poignant and touching
moment between a speaker and
a questioner was interrupted by
a bad joke. Worse yet, Thomas
looked perplexed at the
audience response as though to
inquire of himself what he had
said that was so bad.

I believe that moment said a
lot about the whole debate
because in a very real sense the
debate was about tolerance and
mutual respect for differing
ideas. The Moral Majority
argues its platform of life, fam-
ily, ‘morality and Americanism
but does so with an arrogance
that suggests a monopoly on
these values. That arrogance
bothered me about the Moral
Majority before the debate. Not
only did Thomas fail to placate
this fear, but he managed to
reinforce it. Simplicity and
overgeneralization abound in
movement.

threatened by the power of the
Moral Majority. The interpre-
tation of the First Amendment
argued by Thomas is among the
most restrictive possible, almost
as though the Fourteenth

Amendment had never been‘

ratified.

One saw the potential here
for a direct and systematic dis-
cussion of the issue. Birch Bayh,
given his work with the Senate
Judiciary Committee, is fully
capable of holding his own in
such a discussion. Sadly, none
was forthcoming.

Yet in the final analysis, Tho-
mas hurt his own cause through
his own intolerance. Thomas
did this not only in the moment
described above, but in his atti-
tude regarding all the complex-
ities of family life, military
defense, life styles and patrio-
tism. Perhaps that is an effective
strategy on Bayh’s part. Give a
speaker enough rope and the
speaker will hang himself.

Thus Bayh did not win the
debate as much as he allowed

Thomas to lose it. Bayh argued
his faith in the grass roots, that
the people “out there” will
soon see the Moral Majority for
the danger it is. And when that
happens good people will reject
ugly strategies out of a tradi-
tional sense of fair play and
common sense.

Perhaps he is correct, but
what happens then? Where is
the platform for the 19805 that
will allow liberals to reverse
their electoral failures and con-
tinue a tradition of progress
that is momentarily, at best,
interrupted? Bayh argues no
alternative for the disen-
chanted, not even broad hints or
suggestions. He was too much
on the defensive and as success-
fully as he handled it, he forgets
that old ideas do not die by
themselves but rather are
replaced with I16“: ones.

It is in this sense that the
debate lacked a rational discus-
sion of important and necessary

, issues. What is the alternative to V

the Moral Majority? That dis-
cussion seemed necessary to a
real debate on these problems
because, when all the shouting
has died down, the constituency
of the Moral Majority will
remain. Good and decent peo-
ple may soon reject the excesses
of intolerance and make Jerry
Falwell a footnote to history,
but many Americans will still
have the same fears about a new
and different America that they
cannot understand. Progres-
sives like Birch Bayh should
provide alternative possibilities
and new agendas. Others at dif-
ferent crossroads in the past
have done so and our demo-
cratic institutions survived as a
result.

A final remark or two about
the debate is in order. The Pitt
Program Council did an excel-
lent job in arranging the event.
We should have more such
debates at Pittsburgh and per-
haps the popularity of this
gathering will encourage addi-
tional ones. I also thought the
moderator did an effective job,
handling some difficult
moments- with skill and finesse.
Finally, despite what I said
above, I regarded the evening as
a productive and stimulating
one, clearly one of the high-
lights of this academic year.

explained that the conference was

contacts with working profession-
als, especially those Iike Halber-

pinnacle of their careers. Most of
the money comes from student
organizations, such as the Pitt Pro-

The catalyst for the revival and
the largest contributor is the Stu-

Board, consisting of students,
faculty, administrators and outside
journalism professionals, of which
Gutkind is chairperson.

There has also been a large
amount of administrative support
for the conference, especially from
the Office of Student Activities.

“Student activities has decided to
support the writers’ conference
because it brings together activities
that are both academic and cultural
in nature, and it is something that

.the Office of Student Activities is
on campus to do," Smith
explained.

“It’s a program that brings
together a closer association
between academics and activities.
It's one of the only times that we get
to do things like this, the other
being the annual Jazz Seminar, and
that's why I think the university is
supportive of the conference,"
Smith added.

Other persons who have
appeared at prior writers’ confer-
ences include United Press Interna-
tional White House correspondent
Helen Thomas and “A Separate
Peace” author John Knowles in
1974, National Book Award
winner Nelson Algren in 1975,
Washington Post columnist and
author Nicholas Von Hoffman and
Guggenheim Fellow Herbert Gold
in 1976, and George Plimpton,
author of “The Paper Lion,” in
1977, the last writers’ conference

-until its revival this year.

“The Pitt Program Council, as
the major student programming
organization at Pitt, is always seek-
ing to present new entertaining or
enlightening programs, whether
they be concerts, films, lectures or
other events such as homecom-
ing,” said Bill Jackson, PPC stu-
dent coordinator.

writing as well as the student pop-
ulation at large. Students inter-
ested in writing will be able to meet

“There are, of course, many rea-

‘sons why CGS has decided to spon-

sor the conference, one of the
primary ones being the fact that
media-communications and
media-related majors are one of the
largest groups of degree-seeking
students in CGS. As such, we felt
that they deserved the chance to
take advantage of such a program
in order to meet their educational
and professional interests," said
Cheryl Tomko, president of the
CGS Student Government.

“We have great confidence that
the writers’ conference will be
exciting and will be a great oppor-
tunity for many students to meet
first-hand professionals in the field
of writing,” Tomko added.

Profile: Virgil Cantini, Artist

Virgil Cantini

By LYNNE LACEY

In Oakland, there is a huge
sculpture with a single figure of
a man, completely gold—leafed,
surrounded by an ingenious
series of concentric bands.
Located on the Forbes Avenue
side of the Graduate School of
Public Health, it represents
mankind in the infinite
universe.

Downtown, there are two
colorful mosaic panels along a
pedestrian tunnel, with one
wall depicting a cross section of
stratified earth and the other an
abstract cityscape/overview
combination. Both the design
and materials reflect the city for
which it was constructed.

In East Liberty, there is a
large, rust—colored fountain,
with men and women leaning
backwards, joining hands to
form an unbroken circle. The

steel of which it is made has
been allowed to oxidize.

The artist who is responsible
for these peices of art (and many;
more in the Pittsburgh area) is
Virgil Cantini. In 1952, he
joined the faculty of the Studio
Arts Department at Pitt, where
he is currently the department
chairman.

Cantini is seated behind his
desk in a soft, leather swivel
chair in his office, which is
located in the Henry Clay Frick
Fine Arts Building. His craft is
evidenced everywhere, in all
sizes, from the wall-
encompassing tapestry to his
left to the sturdy enamel goblet-
shaped pencil holder in front of
him, to the poster-sized prints
on his right.

Behind him, blocking the
room’s only window, is a stand-
ing wooden sculpture which
resembles a birdb_ath with a v_e£-

 

 

  

 
 

tical basin. Stars and crescent
moons are carved through the
upright disk, allowing
glimpses of light to show
fleetingly.

Cantini works mainly as an
enamelist, an art form which is
as complex as it is tedious to
complete. One piece may
require as many as 10 to l5
separate enamelings and fir-
ings. This intricate method of
production contributes to Can-
tini’s love of the medium.

“I have complete control of
the intensity and placement of
the colors,” he said. “No other
art form offers me such power
so beautifully.”

Though Cantini prefers this
mode of expression, his energy
and vitality find outlet in prac-
tically all art media, and his stu-
dio and home are crowded with
ceramics, jewelry, oils, mobiles,
carvings and sketches.

His techniques are “all of the
accepted ones, and some that I
devise as I go along,” he said.

“When I played football at
Carnegie Tech (now Carnegie-
Mellon University), the coach
used to tell us, ‘I don’t care how
you get the ball over the goal
line—-stand on your head if
necessary——but get the ball
across,” he said. “That is the
way I feel that the creative artist
must work, using any means at
his command to give expression
to his ideas and translate them
into art forms.”

Cantini’s art can be found all
over the Pittsburgh area. Of his
22 major commissions, l8 are in
the immediate area.

Born in 1920 in Roccaraso,
Italy, Cantini came to this
country at the age of ll. His
mother, the daughter of a sculp-
tor, discouraged her 10 chil-
dren’s interest in the arts which

 

had brought her own family
meager material rewards.

“Never become an artist,
musician or poet, or you’ll
starve,” his mother told him. A
widow, she was financially
unable and emotionally
unwilling to help Cantini
secure his art training.

So the d:.termined boy
planned to earn it in the only
way that seemed possible-—by
playing football. Many slchools
wanted Cantini, the outstand-
ing passing halfback, but few
could provide training for Can-
tini, the budding artist.

He eventually chose Carnegie
Institute of Technology. At
Tech, there was no football
scholarship,.though there was a
splendid art school. After earn-
ing his bachelor’s degree, he
spent a year at Pitt earning his
master’s.

Cantini’s first commissions
(from a Presbyterian and a
Catholic church) followed the
exhibition of some of his reli-
gious subjects in one of Pitts-
burgh's ‘Associated Artists
shows. Soon there were com-
missions from other churches
and architects-

But as far as local patronage
is concerned, Cantini is the
exception, not the rule.

“Commissions from projects,
such as the Gateway Towers,
are supplemental income to
most Pittsburgh artists, even
me, and l’ve been fairly success-
ful in securing commissions
from Pittsburgh’s businesses,”
he explained. “No one in Pitts-
burgh makes enough money to
live on their 'art alone.”

Cantini discussed a recent
article in the Pittsburgh Busi-
ness Times that said lately
Alcoa has been buying Austral-
ian art, since that country is a

  

major producer of bauxite, an'
ore they use extensively.

Cantini exclaims, “That's
exactly what the problem is in
this area. Firms like Alcoa and
U.S. Steel complain continu-
ously about imports destroying
their markets, and what do they
do? They fill their offices with
imported art," he said.

“Big business in Pittsburgh
doesn’t support local art, and
neitlier does its residents. Pitts-
burgh is a town of tough people
and heavy industry, which
tends to make its inhabitants
extremely materialistic,” Can-
tini said. “When it comes time
for money to be spent, the art
forms are naturally the last.”

“The public will pay to see
ballet and theatrical perfor-
mances, but who pays to see an
art exhibit?” Cantini asked.
“We’re paid nothing for shows.
We transport the work and set it
up ourselves. The framing for
one show alone can cost as
much as $2000. It doesn’t seem
fair,” he said.

Walking down a sidestreetof
Oakland with a historian and

personal friend, Cantini com- ’

mented on the way the tele-
phone poles and wires
desecrated the beautiful skyline
and sunset. His companion
mentioned how ugly they were
and asked what effect, ifrany,
they’d had on society.

Cantini wondered. He’s tried
to teach beauty by illustrating
it, aesthetics by example. But
still, when it comes to some-
thing as simple as saving a
sunset by placing wires under-
ground, society balks.

“I had hoped that the concept
of beauty was universal. It has
an effect on me, on everyone,
but still the world hasn’t
changed," he said.

SGB members working on the
Student Health Service said the
survey should be completed by next
week and Dr. Connie Kimbo, vice-
chancellor for Student Affairs, will
send them a copy of the SHS
budget.

Board member Greg Powers said
he will contact U.S. Steel, Alcoa
and Westinghouse to gather infor-
mation on other health care plans.

In other business SGB accepted
budget modification requests for
the Pitt Italian Club, Academic
Affairs Committee, Governmental
Relations Committee,Studio
Theatre and Black Action Society.

They also elected to give full or

FROM: Pitt’s Immoral Minority (PIM) . ’
RE: Recent campus infiltration by so-called New Right L ‘ jC““s-_

and Moral Majority

It has come to our attention recently that the infiltration
of the Pitt campus by persons claiming to ‘be members of
the New Right, Moral Majority and other gimcrack organ-
izations has reached alarming proportions, and must be

"stopped, or at least controlled, immediately.

The first step in controlling these organizations that
claim to speak for the rest of us is to recognize the treacher-
ous forms of infiltration that have taken place. Most nota-
ble of recent attempts at infiltration was last week’s debate
between Moral Majority spokesman Cal Thomas and
former U.S. Senator Birch Bayh. This debate, although
worthless in any socially redeeming way, was an obvious
example of the Moral Majority being able to air its crack-

pot ideas at the students’ expense. There are more subtle

ways, however that the New Right is making headway on
this campus.

0 Clipping out of library books and magazines photo-
graphs which in any way display parts of the human
anatomy. If you have ever opened up an Esquire, Modern
Photography or any other magazine of this nature, you
will find a disproportionate amount df torn, clipped and
cut pages due to persons makinga sincere effort to tell us
what we should and shouldn't see. Unfortunately, for
those of us who never looked at the pictures anyways, these
persons have also managed to cut out pages of printed
material. Be warned that these same persons have been
seen lurking about the medical school library, particularly
near the stacks where anatomy books are located.

0 Preaching in public places. It has been common
knowledge for some time now that there are certain indi-
viduals who persist in creating as much irritating noise as
possible in public areas, such as the Tower, the steps to
Hillman I ibrary. and entrances to the Cathedral of Learn-
ing. They often persist in wreaking their verbal havoc
until being bombarded with eggs, garbage, and other fly-
ing objects. Caution should be exercised when
approaching—or avoiding—these individuals, as close
proximity to them may bring on symptoms of
conver.ciori—or deafness.

I Republicanism and the resurgence of other foul
forms of political participation. There has been quite a bit
of controversy recently surrounding the resurgence of the
Pitt Republican Club and members of the Student
Government Board. The possibility that these persons
may or may not have violated their constitution is not as
important as is the fact that Republicans are in the news
for anything at Pitt. Young Republicans can be identified
by their Docksiders, alligator shirts, affinity for jellybeans
and membership in, fraternal organizations.

0 Objection to certain movements performed by the Pitt
cheerleaders at sports events. Since it is only those persons
who belong to the New Right who can see something
obscene in so-called punk movements and sexist actions,
these persons are easily recognized by their malformed
Freudian behavior. Do not take these persons too
seriously, since they are the only ones who seem to care
about anything the cheerleaders do. Everyone else cheers
for Tiger Paul.

Now that some of the forms by which the New Right has
made its presence felt at Pitt have been listed, it is up to the
persons to whom this memo has been directed to combat

-any further attempts at infiltration.

For your convenience, the Pitt Immoral Minority has
made available copies of The Catcher in the Rye and Studs
Terkel's Working and National Geographic, female mud
wrestling events, and autographed photos of Ted Kennedy
to serve as weapons in the ensuing conflict.

JANE HOLAHAN

By CHRISTINA CLINTON

The recent incident involving
membersof the Student Govern-
ment Bﬁard (SGB) and Pitt’s Col-
lege Republicans should serve as a
valuable lesson to the new board in
regard to their responsibilities to
the student population.

The question‘ of whether the
board members involved, Greg
Powers and Jeff Delmontagne,

’ were trying to infiltrate the College

Republicans for their own benefit,
might have been answered more
quickly if only some studying had
been done first.

The student government offices
are located in the old recreation
room of Schenely Hall. The
Board’s office is next door to its
standing committee’s office. If the
time had been taken by one of the
board members to cross that invisi-
ble line, the potential problems
could have been alleviated.

When SGB president Todd De-
Luca came into the office last Mon-

day morning, he went to the
allocations committee to find out
the status of the organization‘. In a
very short period of time, his ques-
tions were answered.

Why wasn't this seemingly sim-
ple step taken in the first place?
Why did the board members in
question make assumptions about
the College Republicans’ status
and constitution? These questions
have yet to be answered.

Powers and Delmontagne were
also unsure whether or not they
were in violation of their own con-
stitution. Why? Is the SGB consti-
tution too complicated that even its
own members don’t understand it?
These serious questions also
remain unanswered. .

The current SGB members have
been in office less than a month.
While mistakes like this are bound
to occur, it’s a shame it had to
happen. The mistake stemmed
from a quality the board members
involved lack: experience.

They were virtually inexpe-
rienced in any form of student
government activity prior to their
election. That inexperience reared

Lessons ol'Flepub|Tcan Revival‘,

its head last weekend. A potential
board member, especially after his
or her election, should know the
constitution by which they must
abide. If because of some reason
they do not understand it, they
should have the enthusiasm and
common sense to seek out a knowl-
edgeable person before riiey
embark on a mission.

Secondly, board members
should know the inner workings of
their own administration. They
should understand who to go to
when questions of recognition and
other student government policies
come up. Once again, if they don’t

know what the neccesary steps are, .9

they should seek a knowledgeable
source.

It was almost lucky for the Stu-
dent Government Board that this
incident happened so early in its
administration. Hopefully, the
SGB members learned from this
mistake. But more importantly,
hopefully they have gained some
experience from the entire matter
so that it will not be repeated dur-
ing the course of the year.

Where Are America ’s Ideals ?

BY SCOTT REX

After having served four years in
the Marines, 16 months of which
were spent in Europe, I entered the
University of Pittsburgh. At that
time I truly believed that we were
the greatest nation that God had
ever permitted to rule the course of
history. We were the torchbearers
of justice and democracy, or so I
thought.

Seven semesters later, I ask
myself what it is that I believe in
and the only thing I know for sure
is that as a nation we have no ideals
to offer others. All we can offer is
money and empty platitudes.

How can we possibly say that we
stand by the ideal of democracy
while we support the junta of El
Salvador? Major D’Aubuisson led a
coup against the junta last May.
For this attempt at overthrowing
the government he was not even
brought to trial. His friends on the
junta just said, “forget it”-—-is this
justice? The government of El Sal-
vador was and remains a rightist
military regime with a civilian
facade. Since 1979, according to
Roman Catholic studies, 10,000
people have been killed in El Salva-
dor, 80 percent of which is attrib-

In the Jan. 17th New York
Times, former secretary of state
Henry Kissinger scolded his former
assistant, Alexander Haig, for his
conduct of foreign policy. Kissin-
ger stated that at best, Haig’s reac-
tion to the crisis in Poland was
empty. Haig then decided to post-
pone the reopening of the START
talks in Geneva. He conveyed this
message to Soviet Foreign Ministei
Andrei Gromyko recently. Haig
made one fatal mistake in listening

to Kissinger—he did it too late

because the damage was done. The .

START talks will be postponeﬂ
because the martial law imposed

on Polish citizens is undemocratic. I

The United States and the Soviet
Union have it in their best interests
to negotiate for arms limitations.
We should both start seeing reality
for what it is, and not what we want
it to be. Our economies can’t afford
an arms race, but more impor-
tantly, we need to communicate to
the Soviet Union our desire to
avoid a nuclear confrontation. You
don t do this by postponing talks
before they even get a chance to
accomplish their goal. While we
support military regimes that tor-
ture and kill its citizens, who are we

to point ‘our finger at the Sovietggr

Union?

As students, it is our duty to
awake the public. The START
talks must continue. To cut off
talks at this crucial point is analo-
gous to taking a step towards con-
frontation, a type of which man
has never known. At times we feel
that history has stopped by forget-
ting the past and not caring about
the future, but history does con-
tinue. Who could have predicted

  Crucial Call

Sinks Panthers,
lrks Chipman

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

— The heart of an entire Pitt
Panther basketball team lay there
at the foul line pulsating with life.
For it was this heart, and this heart
alone, that had brought the Pan-
thers back from a 10-point deficit
and, with 14 seconds to go, had
given them a chance at a tie, then a
win. Two foul shots from Steve
Beatty could seal a Panther victory
in one of the worst-played but most
exciting emotion-packed games at
the Pitt Field House in recent
memory.

But referee Jack Prettyman, with
one brutal call, crushed any chance
o_f_a Panther win.

With Beatty at the line and Pitt
down by one, 44-43, Prettyman
called Clyde Vaughan for stepping
into the lane too early. Beatty’s foul

shot. which was good for _the tie.
brought temporary euphoria to the

capacity crowd until Prettyman
disallowed the shot and gave WVU
the ball. Pitt Coach Roy Chipman,
so angered by the call, received a
two-shot technical foul that
WVU’s Greg Jones converted to
make the final 48-45, West
Virginia.

“It was likeearning some money‘

then having someone steal it,” the
culprit, Vaughan, would say after
the game.

No doubt Vaughan was in the
lane early, as subsequent replays
showed. Going in the lane a half-
second early is usually tolerated,
much like standing behind the
back line of the batter’s box in base-
ball is overlooked. It occurs often
throughout a game and is rarely
called.A lmost never, that is.

  

Pitt’s Steve Beatty gets set for the foul shot to tie! the game. A

‘‘All game long they were going
in the lane early. He never warned
me and then he calls it.” Vaughan
lamented.

Chipman expressed his displea-
sure a little more vehemently.

‘‘It was a gutless call. The kids
had been playing their hearts out
and he takes the game from them
just like that. He’s got to wake up
in the morning and look at him-
self,” Chipman said.

Maybe it was ironic that a
referee-a West Virginia resident
no less—-would decide the game,
for it seemed that neither side
played to win the game.

Time and time again, Pitt would
get easy shots inside and miss.
Time and time again the ball
would roll around the rim and fall
out, much to the disbelief of Pitt’s
players.

There was a missed George Allen
lay up off a fastbreak, a missed
Chip Watkins follow-up off a
missed shot, a missed reverse lay up
by Darrell Gissendanner and
another miss by Watkins. The
chances were there for Pitt.

They were there because of a 1-3-
1 defense that kept the Mountain-
eers away from the basket. The
taller, bulkier Mountaineers rarely
got the ball inside after the Pan-
thers’ trapping defense was
installed in the second half. It was

so effective that the Panthers, the

weakest rebounding team in the
Eastern 8, outrebounded the
league-leading Mountaineers 45-
42. So good was the defense that the
Mountaineers turned the ball over
22 times.

Panthers Shine At Invite

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

junior half-miler Darren
Geary set one meet record and
freshman hurdler Roger King-
dom tied another as the Pitt
Panthers placed top finishers in
eight of the Pitt Indoor Invita-
tiona1’s 16 events Saturday and
Sunday at the Field House.

Although no team scores
were kept, the Panthers, relay-
ing on their fine corp of middle
distance runners and sprinters
Brian Pollock and Kingdom,
were second only to Eastern
Kentucky in the unofficial team
standings. '

Eastern Kentucky, which
placed top finishers in 12 of the
13th annual meet’s 16 events,
was led by high jumper Ken
Glover, whose first-place leap
of 7-0 tied his own meet record
set in 1980.

Pitt’s Geary, with a 1:51.48
first-place clocking in the 880-
yard trials, shattered the former
Pitt and rneetrecord of 1253.3 set
by teammate Greg Conover in
1981. Geary won the 880-yard
final in 1251.8, followed by
Pitt’s Garland Brown in second
place and Terry Gallagher in
eighth.

Brown's time of 1252.9 also
broke the former meet record
and qualified him for the IC4A
Championships in March.
Brown needs to shave nine-
tenths of a second from his 880-
jyard to join Geary in
qualifying for the NCAA
National Championships, also
in March.

Perhaps the surprise of the
meet was Kingdom, a halfback
for the Pitt football team and
former Georgia state champion
in the high hurdles and deca-
thalon. The freshman from
Valdosta, GA., running in his
first meet this season, was
clocked in 6.05 en route to a
first-place finish in his heat of
the 50-yard hurdles. The time
tied the meet record and also
qualified him for the-‘1C4A
Championships. According to

‘Garland Brown became the second Pitt half-mller to qualify for the IC4A Championships
In March, thanks to a second-place time of 1:52.9 at the Pitt Indoor Invitational this
weekend at the Field House-.

Pitt coach Mike Agostinella,
Kingdom’s opening effort cur-
rently ranks as one of the East’s
best times this season.

“I can’t wait to get in some
more work with him. We’ve
only had him in training for
about two weeks now,” Agosti-
nella said. “He’s a great natural
talent with a lot of desire to run
track.”

Kingdom, who was edged at
the finish by Eastern Ken-
tucky’s Sam Bailey in the finals,
may have difficulty competing
the entire season with the track
team once spring football prac-
tice starts. Agostinella says he
plans to approach Pitt football
coach Foge Fazio about work-
ing out an alternate-day prac-
tice arrangement for Kingdom
that would allow him to con-
tinue to compete and work out
with the track team three days
per week and ‘spend the remain-
ing two days on the football
field.

In addition to Kingdom,
other top finishers for the
Panthers included: Todd Colas,
first in the 1,000-yard run; the
1-mile relay team of Dwayne
DeFoor, Rick Asberry, A1 Coles
and Brian Pollack, in first-place
with a 3:203 time; Pollock,
second in the 440-yard dash;
Mario Joyner, second in the
600-yard dash; Bill Moorhead,
second in the l—mile run; and
the Pantber 2-mile relay of
Mickey Rhitarchik, Joyner, Pat
Moran and Artie Gluck, which
finished fifth.

Agostinella, who termed the
invitational “a real good meet
overall” for his team, especially
praised the performances of
Geary, Colas, Moorhead,
Brown, and Kingdom. Think-
ing back, the coach said his
team may have added a few
more high finishes had not
DeFoor and Asberry, a pre—meet
favorite in the 50-yard dash,
been disqualified for false start-
ing. Eoth runners came back to
turn in strong legs for the win-
ning 1-mile relay team.

F Pitt Swimmers Slowed Down A

By SEAN BARNES
Morgantown, W. Va.-—It was at
- well-rested and prepared West Vir-‘
ginia Mountaineer swim team
which defeated Pitt 77-36 Saturday.
The Panthers swam well, but the
Mountaineers withthe home pool
advantage, out-started and out-
turned their backyard rival in a
meet that had their fans on their

feet for every event.
Pitt, the defending Eastern

against WVU’s Dan Grindel and
Bill Treasurer. Nordheimer had to
be patient with the WVU crowd,
whose manners were horrible
throughout the meet. The custom-
ary crowd silence for diving and the
start of a swim race was never
achieved throughout the entire
meet. Pitt Coach Julian Krug com-
mended Nordheimer’s perfor-
mance and the strong practices he

 

champion, usually leads off every
meet with a powerful lineup in the
400-yard medley relay. But this was
not so at -West Virginia, for the
Panthers swam without their
record-setting backstroker, Ed Ber-
gan, due to, disciplinary reasons.
Freshman Tim Brewer took Ber-
gan’s place, but was outswam by
WVU’s Bill Conrad, who had
shaved everything including his
head, to prepare for the tough Pitt
team. '

Pitt’s Sandy Pidgeon had
another triple-winning meet, his
third in a row. Pidgeon, who has

' not lost one individual event all

season, won the 200-yard individ-

ual medlev. the 500_-yard freestyle,
and the 200-yard breaststoke. But
even Pidgeon commented on how

we. slow WVU’s pool is. With it’s shal-

low depth, waves come back
quickly and slow down the
swimmers’ starts and turns as well
as down-the-stretch racing.

Senior PantheL_R_igk__Carter
turned in much slower-than-usual
times. He, like a few other Pan-
thers, are just getting over bad
colds that have hurt them in prac-
tice. Cartertgot points for Pitt, but
considering the fact that he holds
WVU’s pool record in the 100-yard
freestyle and took third-place in
Saturday’s meet with a time two
seconds off his record, he was not
the Rick Carter that had a triple- .
winning meet against WVU last
season.

Pitt’s -Rex Nordheimer had
excellent showing on WVU’s one
and three-meter diving boards, but,
could only manage a third—place

By TIM DINGER

“Everyone wrestled with emo-
tion and a desire to'win,” said a
happy Panther Coach Rande Stot-
tlemyer after a very satisfying 22-16
Pitt win over Lock Haven State last
night. “We wanted to win, and we
were willing to fight back for it.”

The win moves Pitt’s record up

 o 5-4, but more importantly, it

“gives them momentum going into
tomorrow’s -West Virginia match
against a struggling Mountaineer
squad. The Panthers scored four
decisions, one major, and a pin
while holding Lock haven to_two
decisions, one major, and apm.

At 118 pounds, Ken Whitsel got
things started in Lock Haven’s
favor by headlocking Pitt’s Rich
Esswein to the mat and finishing
him off in 18 seconds.

At 126 pounds, Mike Millward
made it two in a row when he
squeaked past Panther Joe Throck-
morton, 4-3, in a dogfight that was
decided by advantage. Throckmor-
ton started on top when he double-

.,:J.leggetl Millward to the mat with

eight seconds remaining in the first
period.

In the second period, all the scor-
ing went Millward’s way as he
scored an escape and a takedown,
stealing the lead from Throckmor-
ton. Throckmorton mananged an
escape in the third -period to tie the
score at three, but Millward’s
advantage time gave him the
victory. _

At 134 pounds, Craig Richey
started a win streak for the i’anth-
ers by handling Lock Haven’s Don
Parsley, 8-4. Rich fireman‘s carried
and single-legged Parsley to the

 to take a 4-1 first period lead.

In the second period, the two
wrestlers traded reversals, and with
three seconds left in the match,

Richey threw aside Parsley for the.

takedown to cap off the victory.

put in the week prior to the meet.

It was the Pitt freshmen’s first
meet against WVU in their swim-
ming careers at Pitt, which will
include at least three more in the
next three years. Freshman Greg
Murphy looked strong in the 500-
and 1000—yard freestyle events, but
did not get the times or the places
he was hoping for.

“It’s hard to believe t.hev (WVU)
shaved again,” said Murphy. “You

could see they knew their pool bet-

ter than we did.”

The West Virginia team had cut
their yardage back two weeks prior
to meeting Pitt by eliminating
their morning practices and doing
quality work off the blocks and on
the turns. Pitt doesn’t cut- this
much yardage nor spend so much
time practicing starts and turns
until the Eastern Regionals in
March. 

The Mountaineers who shaved,
two even their heads for their meet
against Pitt, will be at a definite
psychological disadvantage when
Easterns roll around, for not only
will it be their third shave of the
season, but the meet will be at
Trees Pool, and Pitt will be out to
defend its Eastern championship
in its own pool. ,_

Pitt Coach Fred Lewis and his
Panther swimmers travel to Indi-
ana University Feb. I3 to take on
the fighting Hoosiers in Pitt’s final
dual meet of the season. Pitt will

With the odds against them, the
Pitt Lady Panther basketball team
won their first game on the road
this season, a 62-60 thriller over
LaSalle College last Friday night.

‘The Lady Panthers, playing
without injured forward Pam Mik-
lasevich, traveled to Philadelphia
seeking revenge for an earlier 58-55
loss at the hands of the Lady
Explorers. In that game, it was the
sound of the official’s whistle that
helped stop Pitt.

Once again, the Lady Panthers
were slapped with one personal
foul after another. The difference
this time, though,was that the
Lady Exploreres were also being
whistled. Although the Lady
Panthers were still on the short end
of a 12-10 margin in free throws,
they were able to make up the dif-

ference in field goals, outshooting
LaSalle 26-24.

The Lady Panthers battled back
from a 34-30 halftime deficit, out-
scoring LaSalle in the second half
32-26. Despite the lead changes and
strategic moves by the coaches, in
the end the game was decided on
one shot. Freshman Stephanie Col-
lins canned a 15-footer with two
seconds remaining to give Pitt the
well-earned victory. The win
upped Pitt’s record to 12-7.

It was a different story when the
Lady Panthers visited Cheyney
State. The Lady Wolves, ranked
fourth in the nation,showed no
mercy to Pitt, soundly defeating
them,85-59. The loss dropped
Pitt's record to 12-8 as the team
returned home to host Howard
Debbie Lewis le(lThe Lad.y-Pam
thers with 21 points. Jennifer

Bruce added 11 and Gail Augh-
burns pumped in 10 while pulling
down 10 rebounds, tops for the
Lady Panthers.

It was no contest from the open-
ing jump, as the Lady Wolves out-
shot and outrebounded Pitt, 36-24
and 46-29 respectively. The Lady
Panthers did not help their Caust?
any, turning the ball over 28 times.

. __ .ﬁJan Ulevlch broke two more records as the Pit! Lady Panthers crushed WVU.

Relaxed ‘Lady Swimmers Win

By scorr DELLETT

There were no surprises in
Morgantown on Saturday as the
Pitt Lady Panther swim team
defeated West Virginia 81-59.
The final tally could have been
larger, but Coach Dave Belo-
wich decided to have the final
events as exhibition.

Several pool records were set
by the Lady Panthers. Jan Uje-
vich broke the marks in the 100-
yard and 200-yard individual
medley with times of 1:01.54
and 2:11.36. Ujevich was alsoin
the 200-yard medley relay with
Amy Jackson, Laura Barber
and Julie Terrell and the 200-
yard freestyle relay with Jack-
son, Terrell and Val Murphy.
Both relays set pool records
with times of 1:51.34 and 1:89
respectively.

The best way to guard
against breast cancer is
right in your hands. It's
called breast se|f-exam-
ination. Ask your doctor to
teach you how to do it.
And while you're at it, ask
him about mammography
-—a low dose breast x-ray.

tion, call your local

Other winners included Jack-
son in the 100-yard butterfly
(58.64), Barber in the 100-yard
backstroke (1201.77), Murphy in
the 50-yard breaststroke (33.20)
and divers Yvonne Johnston
and Holly Sluss in the one-
meter and three-meter diving.
Denise Sedlacek qualified in the
100-yard indiviual medley with
a time of 1:03.90.

Belowich didn’t think the
swimmers’ times were very fast,
but that was due to the team’s
attitude coming in to the meet.

“It was a rather enjoyable,
laidback meet," Belowich said.
‘‘It was an emotional dive
swimming West Virginia after
swimming Princeton three days
before. There was a lower level
of intensity.”

After a rough schedule of four
dual meets in two weeks, the

Lady Panthers are off until Feb-
ruary 14, when they will visit
Tennessee. During this hiatus,
Belowich will be changing the
structure of the team’s practices.

"From here on, practices will
be split for the purposes of the

individual," Belowich said._

“The people who have quali-
fied for Nationals will build up
in distance work. While with
Eastern qualifiers, we will try to
have them qualify for Nation-
als. The others will maintain
distance (workouts) in order to
have them qualify for Easterns
against Tennessee and
Syracuse.”

“We are branching out even
further. Instead of just having
three groups for distance, mid-
dle distance and sprints, we will
have individual groups within
those groups,”:’ Belowich said.

At 142 pounds, Panther Jeff Gor-
don used a double-leg takedown,
then combined a half-nelson and a
chicken wing to get a first-period
pin over Wayde Potter.

At 150 pounds, freshman Doug
Haines came back fromn a 11-7
first period deficit to defeat Lock
Haven's Ken Parsley, 14-12. Dur-
ing the high-scoring match, the
lead changed hands several times,
but in the end, it was Haines’ cra-
dles and arm bars that pushed him
to the win.

Jeff Jelic made it four-in-a-row
for Pitt by narrowly defeating
Doug Buckwalter, 7-3, at 158
pounds. Buckwalter scored first by
escaping in the second period, but
Jelic fought back with a throw-by
to get the takedown. and the lead.
In the third period, Jelic Peter-
soned Euckwalter to his back for
the reversal and the nearfall to fin-
ish up the match.

Lock Haven tried to rally when
Joe Baranic downed Panther Eric
Harris, 15-7, at 167. Harris started
strong by double-legging Baranic
for the first takedown, but from
then on it was all Baranic as he
pulled in four takedowns on the
way to his major decision.

Pitt’s Frank Rich stopped Lock
Haven’s comeback attempt in the
177 pound bout by beating Steve
Williams, 9-6. After‘ a 0-0 first
period, Rich took command by
taking down and throwing a half-

nelson in for a nearfall with 18

. seconds left in the period, to take a

5-1 lead. In the third period, Rich
escaped then worked under a Willi-
am’s headlock attempt to score
another takedown. Williams coun-
tered with a reversal and a take-
down, but could not make up
Rich's lead.

At 190 pounds, Frank Vulcano I

finished off any hopes for a Lock
Haven victory by pounding Bob
Duponte, 12-3. Vulcano started the
match by barrel-rolling then arm
barring Duponte for the takedown
and nearfall to take a 5-0 lead.
Second period action saw Vulcano
reverse and again bar arm Dupont
to extend his lead. A reversal in the
third period capped off his, and the
Pitt team’s victories.

At heavyweight, Lock Haven’s
Todd Ribovich tightened the score
by downing Pitt’s Dan Kasper-
koski 3-1.

Panther Coaches Stottlemyer
and Coryea were pleased with the
winning attitude that the wrestlers
showed in the past week’s practice
and last night’s match, and they
hope the team can carry that atti-
tude into Tuesday night’s show-
down against West Virginia.

Coach Stottlemyer will try to
correct the few mistakes made last
night, in hopes of taking another
strong Panther line-up against the
Mountaineers, even though weight
problems may necessitate a line-up
shift. ‘

Bah Besang aglainiledithe Pltt team with a strong second-place

performance in the floor exercise Saturday at Ohio State.

Pitt Near-Record Mark
StiIlLow at Ohio State

ByAMIKE ROSE

The Pitt Panther mens’ gymnas-
tics squad improved its team score
by five points, but it wasn’t enough
to overtake No.7 Ohio State, .or a
strong Michigan team Saturday at

. Colombus, Ohio.

The Panthers (1-1) finished in
the tri-meet with a solid 255.6 score
but still lost by a gaping margin to
the Buckeyes (266.75) and Michi-
gan (266.55).

The Panthers, as head coach
Frank D’Amico predicted, would
not have a chance to win the meet if
the Buckeyes scored over 260
points. D’Amico, with his lineup
still shuffled due to national quali-
fier Frank Kurtz’s slow recovery
from the flu, was hoping OSU
would break in a few routines and
the Panthers could somehow hit a

score of 260 or better to steal the.

ITl€(:‘I..

It didn’t happen Saturday, de-
spite strong showings by ever-
consistent Bob Besong, Dave Smith
and freshman John Garrside who
again filled in for Kratz in several
events. Kratz competed Saturday,
but still showed the weakening
effects of his week-long bout with
the flu.

Besong again excelled in his spe-
cialty, the floor exercise, with a
solid 9.45 score to take second
place, followed by Smith in third

with a 9.4. Besong also took fourth

place on the rings with a 9.10 mark.

The only other top finisher for’ J

Pitt was Chris _Femian_i, who took
fifth on the rings with an 8-95
mark—the identical score that won
him first place at last week’s meet.

Despite the loss, D’Amico, who
wanted the Panthers to hit at least a
255 score in the meet, was satisfied

. with the team’s showing.

“We did a pretty good job,”
D’Amico said. “I was not upset
whatsoever with the performance
of my team.” A few years ago,
D’Amico pointed out, Pitt lost by a
whopping 88 points to OSU.

The Panthers’ next meet is Sat-
urday against archrival Temple at

Pitt’s Trees Hall. D’Amico, who‘

rates Temples talent on par with
Pitt's, expects a close meet in the
Panthers’ home opener. Temple
scored a 256 last Thursday. but
D’Amico said the Owls sl'iouldn’t
score that well going against a
team of Pitt's caliber.

D’Amico claims this year’s team
is his best ever in his five years at
Pitt, and says he hopes to see the
Panther team scoring record of
255.8 fall against Temple. With
Kratz returning, the Panthers
should have little trouble negotiat-
ing the slim point margin that
separates them from the record.

WVU to hurry countless passes and

“We were playing very hard, and
we went at them hard. The defense

in all the bad basketball, in all the
