Druids Chaiige

Selection Plans

A new method of investigation and
interview, which will no longer re-
quire petitions from prospective
members, has been adopted by
Druids, national sophomore activities
fraternity, according to Joseph Rob-
erts. BA41, president.

Used this year for the ﬁrst time,
the new plan calls for members of
Druids to submit names to an inves-
tigating committee. The freshman
having the necessary activities re-
quirements will then be invited in
for interviews.

The plan was adopted to overcome
the incongruity of “petitioning to an
honorary,” Roberts said.

Druids will meet on Wednesday
night. Place of the meeting will be
announced in Wednesday’s News.

Festival Dance

In Circus Style

The smell of sawdust, the cry of
dusty-voiced barkers, plus sideshows
and wild animal cages will greet
dancers at the Spring Festival
“Campus Circus” dance on Friday,
May 12..

To carry out the circus theme, the

ballroom of the Hotel Schenley will‘

be transformed into a giant tent re-
plete with cages and barkers and
circus novelties for the Friday festiv-
al dance.

Instead of the customary ragtime
band, however, “Rin”gﬁ‘ia§tér” Larry"
Rothman, C41, has promised the
“sweet swing” of Owen Peiper and
his orchestra, who played at the Mil-
itary Ball.

According to Pat Cusick, E40, bus-
iness manager, admission to the af-
fair will be included in the Spring
Festival $5 book of tickets available
until May 1 in the oiﬁce of the dean
of men and from campus representa-
tives.

Also included on the committee
are Doris Wacker, C40; Bill Allen,
E42; Betty Oestreicher, C41; Walt
Lovett, E40; Clint Sipe, C39; Bob

Chinese School Trustees Uffer
Fellowship to College Graduates

I:.v JACK BRADY
As a result of the successful ex-
change plan carried out between
American and Chinese universities
for the past ﬁve years, the trustees
of Lingnan university, China, are
offering a graduate fellowship for a
year’s study, according to Olin D.
Wannamaker, American director.
During the last ﬁve years, 70 men
and women undergraduate students
from American colleges and univer-
sities have studied at Lingnan uni-
versity. According to Mr. Wanna-
maker, these students have been
unanimously satisﬁed with the re-
sults of their year in the Far East.
Because of the war conditions ex-
isting in China at the present time,
it was deemed advisable to send one
mature student who has already re-
ceived his ﬁrst academic degree.
The campus of Lingnan university
is given up to civilian relief work. In
November, about one-half of the
American community and a limited
part of the Chinese community were

A
V’

caring for 7,200 refugees. This in-
cluded feeding, housing, medical
care, and elementary education for
these victims of the war.

Mr. Wannamaker declared, “Facil-
ities will be considerably below nor-
mal and the student should go out
with a plan for pursuing a somewhat
special course under faculty direc-
tion and partly according to instruc-
tions provided by his major professor
in America.”

As to the value to be derived from
a year in China, he explained, “The
beneﬁt a student would receive from
this year, would depend largely upon
himself.”

John Baker, BA38, was a student
under the Exchange Plan last year.

Additional information concerning
this plan can be secured from
Thrysa W. Amos, dean of women, or
by writing to Olin D. Wannamaker,
American Director, Trustees of Ling-
nan university, at 150 Fifth Avenue,
New York city.

Syphilis Tests

Lack Response

“Response to the present Wasser-
mann test campaign has been less
than expected,” according to a report
from Dr. H. C". Carlson, director of
the Student Health Service. A total
of 215 students, out of a potential
1,200, have taken the test up to to-
day. ‘ I

Dr. Carlson, who is personally con-
ducting the tests, pointed out that re-
sults of this year’s quota would not
be as high as that of last year be-
cause most of the upperclassmen had
taken the test. He advised all fresh-
men and those upperclassmen who
were not tested last year, to come to
Falk Clinic this week.

Students will not be further con-
tacted by the Health Service unless
results are positive. Reactions are
being analyzed by the City Health
Department, under the direction of
Dr. I. Hope Alexander.

The campaign jointly sponsored by
The News and the Health Service,
will continue this week only, daily
except Friday, from 9:30 until 4:30
o’clock. Similar tests will be given
women today by Dr. Auleene Jami-
son, director of the women’s health
service.

A Release
From the Educators

ELEASED today was a manifesto signed by

2,169 American educators and publicists,
“summoning their colleagues to accept. the respon-
sibility resting upon them to take conscious activ-
ity in (lefense of democracy.”

The manifesto, prepared by a committee of 17
outstanding educators and journalists together
with the New York Committee for Democracy and
Intellectual I<‘reer.lom. is an elaboration, and a
broadening both in scope and content of a .~;ome-
what siinilar manifesto presented last December by
a group of scientists headed by Franz Boas of
Columbia uiiivcrsity. A

\Vc thought that earlier manifesto was "import-
ant. And we think this one even more vital. Not
particular-l_v because of the imposing list of signa-
tories which includes 156 college and university
])l'€‘Sl(lGlll."§, six state commissioners of education,
139 deans, and 30 headmastcrs and principals of
private schools, representing :1 total of -1110 institu-
tions from -16 states.

lut we do think that this is one of the most ad-
mirable statements of its kind we have ever read,
and we believe that every sincere educator and stu-
dent slzould read and follow the outline of ‘die
manifc-sto. if education is to play its part in the
preservation of conditions conducive to academic
freedom and tolerance. We, tliercfore take the
liberty to reprint, i11 full, the text of this . . .

Manifesto of Educators

The present grave threat to world democracy
places a heavy responsibility on those of us who are
entrusted with the education of the youth of our
country and with the channels through which knowl-
edge and truth are disseminated to the Americ.an
people. The forces which would replace democracy
by fascist dictatorship are powerful and unscrupulous.
In order to destroy our American tra.d.ition of toler-
ance and mutual cooperation they are attempting to
divide our people by propaganda. inciting to racial and
religious persecution. ‘We cannot remain passive in
this situation. We must be true to our democratic
American ideals. Democracy can be maintained and
extended only by conscious activity on our part.

Fascism openly despises and, of necessity, sup-
presses the truth. It ruthlessly regiments schools,
press, radio, and movies. It burns books and works
01' art. It ridicules and denies the principle of equal
educational opportunities for all. It forces women
into labor camps. It wipes out the great tradition of
western humanism and replaces humanistic education
with race hatred and religious intolerance. It gloriﬁes
war as the highest human good.

What is our responsibility? Vile must recognize
the threat to democracy inherent in demands for re-
trenchment in education, in attacks on the Bill of
lliiglrts, in gag laws, in censorship of tea-cliers and
journalists, in racial and refigious intolerance, in
those newspapers which make profit or power their
chief goal.

We pledge our supgaort to those measures which
will help to strengthen and preserve our democracy.

1. If we are really to be “one nation, indivisiblc,
with liberty and justice for all," our schools must pro-
vide liberty and justice for all, without discriniination
on account of poverty, sex, race, or religion.

2. Our teachers must be trained with fullest con-
sciousness of their responsibilities; they must. be de-
voted to the principles of democracy and intellectual
freedom and they must be free to inculcate their
eiitlmsiasm in the minds of the young.

3. Our children and our adults must receive full
moral and material assistance in their pursuit of
lmowledgc.

4. Our basic civil liberties of speech, press, as-

5. Our schools, press, an r3.dio must present the
facts, and the truth behind the facts, about our history
and iratliiions, about the world in which we live,
about race and culture, without fear or malice, with-
out suppression or distortion.

We stand squarely behind democracy as the essen-
tial requirement for further human progress. l/Ve have
full conﬁdence in the American people. If they have
the enlightenment which can be developed only in
free schools by free teachers, and by an untrammeled
press. they will do their part to preserve and extend
our cmccratic heritage. Our role is to fulﬁll our
true function as educators and journalists in a demo-
cratic society by keeping free these channels of
lmowleclge so that the people can examine the facts
with the critical spirit necessary for an intelligent
appraisal and choice.

THE PITT NEWS

Keep 0ff The Grass...

By Bill Alazefsky

Cone . . .

Gone is Joe College of the wild twenties. Gone, and
in his place is a serious lad, intent upon an education
that may somehow aid in curing man’s many ills.

Anyway that is an impression left by so many of
youth experts, who ﬁll the pages of the slick magazines
with columns of experting. Too bad that our youth
don’t recognize and live up to these observations—par-
ticularly the college lads and lassies.

For some time now we have been searching for the
sober miens and horn-rimmed glasses that should be"
lurking in the Commons Room according to the vener-
able experts. Cou1dn’t ﬁnd any. Then we read some-
thing about the college men who started swallowing
gold ﬁsh, which isn’t the best way to cure national ail-
ments.

Then someone told us about the invitation that had
been sent to the King of Egypt by the Pitt Cap and
Gown boys. Thesce incidents are contemporary sam-
ples of what Joe Co1lege’s successor occasionally does.
Or maybe Jce College isn’t gene. These experts never
did tell us where he went.

From a recent FPA (Franklin P. Adams) column,
“The Conning Towerz” News item: “Infuriated gold
ﬁsh swallows freshman.”

Hold tight, hold tight foorcedeackasaki want some
sea food mama, shrimpers and rice. they’re very nice.
Isn’t it silly?

 :1:

This suggestion may be a little too late but the fra-
ternity slates might have had an excuse for running on
a platform that included a dry plank. The efficient In-
dependent propaganda machine mailed out instructions
to the voters that included a 1939 schedule of the Pi-
rates with an advertisement of a well known local brew-
ery on the front page. Tch, Tch, boys, the dean of
women's office will get you if you don’t watch out.

J . Stewart Hunter’s journalism class will join forces
with Editcr '1‘om Smith’s “Pitt Panther” and prepare
copy for the May issue. The objective of this avis will
be a take—oif on “Time,” and the result should be nu-
merous chuckles.

Surveys Poll Shows

By Student Opinion Surveys of America.

AUSTIN, Texas, April 24.—-—There are some six mil-
lion young people who within six weeks to several years
will leave college with a pessimistic outlook on their

wn i'utu1"es. _

Almost one-half of the men and women in colleges
and universities in this country believe they are facing
a world that offers less opportunities for success than
it did before the time they were born. These are the
results of a poll just conducted nationally by the Stu-
dent Opinion Surveys of America, the Weekly sounding
board of college youth, of which The News is a member.

A scientiﬁcally-deﬁned cross-section of students was
asked, “Do you think the opportunities for most young
men and women to get ahead today are as good as they
hay have been 30 years ago?” The economic problem of
youth is no myth to 48 per cent of the collegians, while
the rest of them, 52 per cent, have an optimistic view
of the world into which they are going.

Although very few college students today have a
personal l<now1r:dge of conditions three decades ago,
‘heir answers appear to be based on what they can see
now and wliat they have learned about the past. A

slight majority is convinced that opportunities have’

been increasing, like the Pennsylvania student who
points to the greater number of occupations which now
exist. On the other hand, another student in the same
state, in Temple University, answers negatively, stating
that the number of youth has increased, thus reducing
1329 number of available jobs. A Cornell senior be-
lieves that success is there for those with initiative, re-
gardless of conditions.

The growth of the use of machinery, the demand
for more education, and government regulation of in-
dustry and employment are given as reasons for a de-
crease in opportunities to get ahead.

Art Cinema

Filled with subtle innuendoes and a frank picture of morality,
Sacha Guitry’s “Story of a Clicat” brings to the Art Cinema ‘the most

adult ﬁlm fare that the censor board has ever adniitted to this state. i

Depending mostly on the Varied talents of lllr. Guitry—director,
writer, and actor——the picture present a racy philosophy that is so
A

characteristic of the Parisian.
Witty, bold, yet always keeping
this side of the ﬁne line, the biog-
raphy is outstanding if only for its
novel presenta-
‘ tion. Monolog-
ist Guitry in ex-
citin g tone
proves in typical
Gallic fashion
that crime does
pay, and the
wicked do in-
herit the earth.
Following the
Greek dramatic
style, the Cheat
is forced by fate
into a life he
does not really want. But when he

rebels and tries honesty, he is accus-
ed of cheating. Voila! There you
are. And on this original frame is
built one of the most amusing movies
of the year.

Piitshurgli Playhouse

Hampered by a weak book and 9.
dated musical score, the Playhouse
players struggle valiantly.

“Meet My Sister” belongs to the
1930 vintage of intimate Viennese
revues. Such a play lacking the sup-
port of “lags and blackouts” should
have a more meaty plot.

The double indentity theme has
been run ragged by such really out-
standing Lunt-Fontanne hits as “The
Guardsrnan” and “Arnphitryon 38.”
Frederick Burleigh could have made
a much wiser selection for the ﬁnal
play of the season.

Eloise Drake, possessor of a fine
soprano voice and a veteran of “The
Great Waltz,” turns in a really pro-
fessional‘ performance. Personablc
Edward Blaine makes the most of an
inadequate script. Real laurels must
go to Marjorie McCann, Sammy
Schwartz and substitute Fred Bur-
leigh who has temporarily taken over
for ailing Jules Pross. These three
fine comedians inject much needed
sparkle with a hilarious dance
routine.

Chief mainstay of the production
is the ﬁne musical accompaniment
of duo-pianists Leah Cofier and
Ruth Levin. Starting with a
sprightly overture they set a brisk

pace for the show.

Harvard ﬁffers
Training Plan

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. —— (ACP)-—
Pointing the way to what may be-
come a new system of U. S. education,
Harvard university authorities have
declared successful the experimental
plan of training high school gradu-
ates by “undergraduate faculties.”
Designed to aid high schood grad-
uates who cannot attend college, the
nation’s oldest university has created
classes that are taught by students.
Under the new system, 50 Boston
high school alumni have followed
college courses under the volunteer
tutelage of 100 Harvard undergrad-
uates, most of them honor men.
Classes in the unique course meet
at night in the dormitory rooms of
“faculty members.” There they have

relayed on to them the material that
the “teachers” have learned in their
college courses.

The “pickaback scholar” plan is
being continued this semester, and
has interested National Youth Ad-
ministration oﬁicials, who are con-
sidering offering this work to col-
lege students who now receive gov-
ernment aid.

Besides learning in evening class-
es, the “pickaback scholars” watch
experiments in the university’s labor-
atories and have full use of the uni-
versity libraries.

OPPORTUNWY

PITTSBURGH

From the
Shoulder

 

By Leonard Levison

Sports Editor

Nothing has been holding the spring program back more than the
lack of spring. A meagerly-dressed trackinen needs either a place on
the Rand Ranch or at least a warm sun to feel right, and of what con-
sequence is a high-powered outdoor intramural program when the
days are rain-laden and the ﬁelds are mushy‘! No one, not even the
strong voice Independent party, had been praying for an interrup-
tion in the bleakness and a return to calendar orthodoxy more than
the Panther coaching clan.

It was understandable, therefore, when coaching brothers Olson.

Dick the Dandy Cassiano, making every apparent eifort to land

that there was strong ray of hope headed toward the local horizon.
And it appears that the chastened weather-caller is on the bandwagon
this time. Spring is in the air.

This change in atmospherial conditions should add, if addition is
possible. to the ebulliency of Carl “take-a-crack-at-track Olson, who
has something more than a break in the weather. He’s got something
in the way of a track team. Saturday he must have come close to the
bursting point when he realized, along with the district’s cinder fol-
lowers. this to be a fact. In crushing the Owls, the Panthers were
not reluctant to reveal that they have something that approximates
the highest excellency in the matter of sprinters, middle-distancers,
and :1 weightman.

Most strategists are agreed that no effective policy will be de-
viscd in the present movement to “stop ll/Iocdruif.” He has already
shown that he knows how to antidote an encirclement. He showed
this in the Berlin Olympic when he just detoured his encirclers by
stepping around them. And, Saturday, as he lolled around the bends
he showed that he was in the pink.

This indicates that the Panthers should be in for another pleasant
week-end in the Quaker town. They had a. nice time last year at the
Penn Relays when they were able to come back home with three of
those mural-sized plaques that signify a championship in the Carnival.
There is every reason to believe that they should have the same re-
sults this week.

\Voocli-uff, who some of the critics accused last year of “taking
the Penn Relays for his own,” will be willing, ready, and able to trod
the same cinder paths he has so eloquently trod before. Then, too, the
other members of the winning quartets are, for the most part, back. In
the cases where there is a personnel change, there has been an in-
crease in strength. Clyde Graf is a spreading sophomore who will
take junior Al McKee’s place in the mile relay team. This is being
done to make that baton-passing group all the more likelyto win.
Last year they gave anchor man XVoodruff a lead, which is like carry-
ing coals to Newcastle. It just doesn’t have to be done.

l'p on the hill, Chisel Bowser‘s appeasement policy will welcome
the olive branch of ’Ol Sol. The halfbacks will be able to dig their
cleats in ground that has some substantial feel about it instead of
slitliering about in the mud that has been the character of the practice
lot so far this spring.

And of more import. at the moment will be the fact that Ralph
hlittei-liiig will be able to forget about the sunny south and begin to
‘feel that Pittsburgh’s not a bad place after all. There has been a.
well-groiuided report that he will relish any changethat will enable
him to blot out the Easter past. Although the general concensus is
that Dixie isn’t so bad after all, even if it does sometimes snow
in Durham. and that the baseballers did as could be asked from any

group of neophytes. Now that they are established back 011 the home , and three thirds, gave the Winners 21

lot, and the spring exhibition games are over, they the expected to
make everyone forget about the Pirates.

 

that Rhodes scholarship kept walk-9

ing like that dream of which he used 3
to be a part, by scoring the opening
touchdown. It was one of those cut-
backs through tackle that Cassiano
has learned so Well in the past that
accounted for the ﬁrst bit of scor-
ing. This was accomplished in the
first quarter, shortly before the cus-
tomers were seated.

Dick the Dandy came through a
little while later with one of those
arching passes, something on the
order of the one he threw against
Ohio Wesleyan two years ago, Emil
Narick, playing at right halfback
did the receiving. During the course
of the play, 50 yards were consum-

ed and the boys in Blue had their
second touchdown. The pass went

20 yards and Narick went 30. The

customers were still not seated.
Narick, the old dipsy—doodler,

knifed his way 30 yards for the third

and ﬁnal touchdown in the third pe-
riod. The customers were not set-
tled in their seats. Oh, that’s right,
it was a practice game. No custom-
ers, no seats.

All in all it was a pretty good day
for Narick, the old prom-trotter.
Larry Clinton must have loosened
him up considerably. He runs much
easier and more effectively.

Ernie Bonnelli, at fullback, was
the ﬁrst serious casulty of the year.
He had to be carried from the ﬁeld
because of a leg injury after Joe Ret-
tinger had smashed him down to
earth.

Rettinger, incidently, was the star

of the day. He appears to be one of
the best football players on the
squad. He looked that way last year
while taking a second seat to the
All-American ends, Daddio and Hoff-
man. He accounted for both of the
extra points, missing one of his
tries.

Recession Hits 1939 Panthers, ,
Dropping Pitt Froin Leading Role

The recession hit Pitt’s athletic de-9

partment with unusual vigor this
year, and whereas the 1938 season
saw all kinds of championship wall
to the Panthers, the 1939 record
makes unimpressive reading. (But
then things are bad everywhere).

The ’3S squad was conceded the
National Football championship, re-
ceived the Lambert trophy, symbolic
of the Eastern football champion-
ship, and sealed the city leadership
in the trophy case. This year’s grid-
ders failed to retain any of these
‘trophies, but did retain a concession
—they were recognized as one of the
couiitr_v‘s greats- despite the Tech
and Duke defeats.

The Pitt basketball team was just
about on par with the ’38 squad
which was deﬁnitely below par. (Are
you following us). While Duquesne
walked away with the city title cup,
the Panther courtmen were playing
hide and seek with the 500 percent-
age mark and ended the season just
a shade over 500 line.

Olson’s cross-country team saw
plenty of scenery on its ambles over
the country side, but they didn’t win
any particular honors. They turned
in a fair record but never showed
any championship qualiﬁcations.

Pitt swimming team lost its 1938
Eastern Intercollegiate championship
title and lost Coach Pat Corr, who re-
signed as a gesture of protest against
Pitt’s athletic policies. Pitt swim-
mers also dropped dual meets to
Ohio State and Franklin and Mar-
shall.

Perhaps the brightest spot in the
Pitt athletic picture is this year’s
hockey team, which lost the play-offs
in the Ohio-Pennsylvania Intercol-
legiate Hockey Championship to John
Carroll. After placing second to Du-
quesne in the Eastern Hockey divi-
sion, the Panther icers outlasted the
Dukes and skated into the ﬁnal
matches with John Carroll. [I

Olson’s indoor track campaign was '
quite a sad matter. The team, rid-
dled by injuries, failed to hit a Win-
ning stride until the ﬁnal sessions
when the mile relay team started to
reach the tape ﬁrst. With a wealth
of material that has ﬁnally rounded
into condition Olson is expecting to
strike a high peak in Pitt’s 1939 de-
pressive championship chart during
the outdoor season.

Pitt’s baseball team with inexpe-

rienced men, new to the diamond,
has served as fodder for the victory
column of Southern teams in its ﬁrst
four games. Mitterling’s team need
experience before they can success-
fully cope with the other veteran
collegiate nines.

The Panther golf and tennis teams
are just about starting their seasons.
Pitt golfers will probably follow the
unimpressive pattern of the other
teams while the racqueteers may
hi—jack themselves a title or two.

Then there is the unathletic po-
litical situation on campus. Last year
the Fraternities won the game 27 to
3, and this year the Independents up-
set the applecart. Business is bad,
too!

 

Penn State Tennis
Team Beats Pitt

Pitt’s tennis team opened its sea-
son inauspiciously last Saturday
when it fell prey to the Penn State
netters and found itself on the short
end of a 7-2 score at State College.

Only Joe Kristufek, Pitt’s number
one man and holder of numerous dis-
trict titles, and Francis Harmuth
were able to win their single
matches. The other four single
matches were taken by the Staters.

In the doubles Pitt was white
washed. All three double games
went to State. Kristufek and Har-
muth were unable to make any head-
way against the combination of Hil-
debrandt and Weinstein State’s nuin-
ber one and two.

‘While Kristufek won his singles
match from Captain Albert Hilde-
brandt, State’s top man, Malcomn
Weinstein aced Adrain Hartman,

‘Winners Slug Hard
As Dannies F alters

The fraternity mushball race is

now a wide open scramble. Delta
Tau Delta pasted a 13-5 lambasting
on pitcher Bob Dannies, as they
stopped the Phi Delt winning streak
in Thursday's battle. After two
scoreless rounds, the Delts broke
loose with a third inning outburst
which produced seven runs on eight
hits. Six more runs in the last two
frames ﬁnished the downfall of the
previously unbeaten Phi Delts.

Sigma Alpha Mu and Phi Epsilon
Pi kept going with wins over Phi
Gamma Delta and Sigma Chi, respec-
tively. Lew Mendlow pitched the
Sammies to a 6-4 victory, dominating
the game, as per usual, with 12 strike-
outs. Three runs in the ﬁrst gave
the victors a lead which a late Fiji
rally fell short of catching. The Phi
Eps outlasted Sigma Chi in a wild
15-14 slugfest. Nine counters in the
ﬁrst gave the winners a substantial
lead, but they succeeded in the al-
most impossible task of losing this
margin. and had to score the winning
run in the last inning. Both the Phi
Eps and the Sammies, as well as the
Delts and Phi Delts, have but a single
defeat marring their records.

In other games, Pi Kappa Alpha
and Lambda Chi Alpha picked up

7 9-47

By Bill Mazefsky

Pitt’s fast stepping track team
outran Temple's touted thin-
clad’s, 79-47, 011 the Stadium turf
last Saturday, ﬂashing champion-
ship form that resulted in three
new meet. records by Panthers
and one Owl snaring a fourth new
standard.

Olympic Champion Johnny Wood-
ruff resumed his record breaking
proclivities by topping his own mark
in the half mile with a casual 1:56.6
run through the event. He also had
an easy time stepping home ﬁrst in
the mile.

Frank Ohl who three weeks ago
beat Johnny
“quarter,”

in the Butler relay
almost reached world’s

record time in
, the 220-yard dash
after winning the
Turning

‘i om bettered Eul
Peacock’s former

recognized
world mark.
 Johnny Bazyk,

Pitt shot putter,
showed Olympian
form with 16-
pound ball. Johnny ﬂipped the heavy
ball 49 feet and 21/2 inches, which
was two feet over the old meet rec-
ord.

Ohl

“Red” Jensen, ace Temple jumper,
prevented a Pitt monopoly of rec-
crd breaking. Red’s 13 feet, and
43/2 inch zoom in the pole vault dis-
carded the meet’s 13 feet mark. Jen-
sen also tied for ﬁrst place in the
high jump at 6 feet, 2 inches, with
Dave McDowell, Panther sophomore.

Pitt dominated the sprints, half
Graf, Ferrara, and McKee one, two
mile, and middle distances. Pitt men
tliree’d the quarter mile. Boulanger
placed the two mile run in the Pitt
pointage.

Ohl’s win in the broad jump gave
him three ﬁrsts and made high point

Tantlier Golfers

Blank Tartans
For Initial Win

Beaten decisively by West Vir-
ginia in the season opener, the Pitt
golf team reversed its ﬁeld and beat
the Carnegie Tartans, 9-0, in their
annual match at the Pittsburgh Field
club last Saturday.

Paced by Tony Kaye and Bill Dad-
dio, veteran 1-2 combination for the
Panthers and only veteran holdovers
from last year’s powerful squad, the
Pitt team had little difficulty sub-
duing the Tartans. Only one of the
six individual matches went beyond
the 16th green when Pitt’s Bob Sey-
bold had to travel the full distance
to edge out Charles Klimas, 1 up.
Kaye and Daddio led the medal
scoring with 78’s, six over par. None
of the Tartans maintained a pace
that would have broken 80, had they
ﬁnished their rounds.

Other winners for the Panthers
were Bill Reilly, Homer McClintick,
and Charles Mathias.

Two days prior to the opening of
the oﬁicial season the golf team in-
vaded West Virginia to receive a
71:4;-7% drubbing at the hands of the
Mountaineers. The match was play-
ed on sodden links, but that factor
didn’t seem to hinder the West Vir-
ginia pellet pounders in the least.
Bill Daddio, No. 1 man, was the
lone Panther golfer to capture his
match, 1 up, over Graham, top West
Virginia man. Bill Reilly halted
with Hopkins to contribute a half
point to the ﬁnal score. In the three
best ball matches the Mountaineers
capitalized the play.

Placement Head Reveals
Requirements for Work

Sturzlent Will Need
Scholastic Ability,

Job Experience
By n.o.i.P;i K.-u.i.ocK

Vv'hat do employers look for when‘;
they interview seniors for positions? i
Edward B. Williams, director of the.
Placement Bureau for men, points to I
three factors which materially af-f
feet the success or failure of the col- }
lege man to secure the position he‘
desires. ;

These factors are ( 1) scholastici
ability, (2) an activities record which ;
indicates initiative, leadership, andi
ability to get along with others, and!
(3) outside working experience‘?
Even if a man has only driven a[
truck, says Mr. Williams, he shows;
tha he has worked, can work, and 
willing to work. I
DEMAND FOR ENGINEERS

The greatest demand at the present 
is for engineers, approximately 65,’
per cent of all placements made byi
the Bureau being of graduates of the
School of Engineering. Business Ad-i,
ministration students rank second"
and College students third. Mr,
‘Williams explains that the majority
of the College people are "'pre-some-
thing” and plan to enter the profes-
sional schools, a factor which conse-
quently reduces the number of place-
ments made for members of that
school.

In addition to the primary quali-
ﬁcations, Mr. Williams has noted
that during the past year employers
seeking men for sales positions de-
mand, in many instances, that the
applicant have s ome technical
knowledge as well as a general col-
lege background.

FILING SYSTEM

To facilitate the Bureau's place-
ment of students and graduates, a
comprehensive ﬁling system is main-
tained. In this ﬁle is kept the appli-
cation of every senior and experi-
enced graduate who has voluntarily
registered with the Bureau. Follow-
ing registration in September each
senior in the three schools is invited
to make application to the Bureau
for work upon graduation.

Mr. Williams stressed the import-
ance of neatly and correctly ﬁlling
out these applications, and especial-
ly of attaching a good photograph.

“The pictures are important,” he
said, “because they give employers
who look at the cards a much better
impression of the student, and they
assist the man to become more than
merely a name on a card.

The Placement Bureau was or-
ganized on its present basis in 1933.
Before becoming its director in 1937,

Students to (Dbtain
Rhodes Petitions
From Dr. James

Applications are now available for

Rhodes scholarships for the year
19-10, Dr. A. P. James, professor of
‘;1istory, announces. Any students

who are interested should obtain ap-

plications from Dr. James in 2232
Cathe ral.
Requirerrents, stated in the  of

the late Cecil Rhodes, founder of the
scholarships, include literary and
scholastic abilities, qualities of man-
hood, truth, courage and _1'.'ellowship.
moral force of character, and physi-
cal vigor, “as shown by interest in
outdoor sports or in other ways.”

Dr. James, himself a Rhodes schol-
ar, accounted for the fact that Pitt
has never produced a Rhodes scholar
by saying that pupils here are com-
pelled to be specialized; in other
words, in order to excel in athletics,
the student is forced to neglect his
studies.

Sklar Arranges
Parking Rates

Arrangements have been made for
students to park in Ruskin ﬁeld at
reduced rates on baseball days, Wil-
ford Sklar, BA40, chairman of the
SFA Parking committee, has an-
nounced.

Following the city police announce-
ment that parking will be prohib-
ited on the Schenley park plaza on
days that baseball games will be
played, and with the expectation that
parking rates would be demanded at
the usually free Ruskin ﬁeld, the
parking committee made the follow-
ing arrangements:

On days when no parking is per-
mitted in the Schenley plaza the
Ruskin ﬁeld operators will permit
students, who properly identify
themselves to the authorized attend-
ents, to park on the upper ﬁeld at a
reduced rate.

Sklar stated that the rate would
probably be 10 cents, as the regular
rate will be 25 cents.
