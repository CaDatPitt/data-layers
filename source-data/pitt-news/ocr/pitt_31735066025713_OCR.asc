Speaker criticizes Spike Lee,

Tony Fathergilll/TheWPitt News

Dr. Maulana Karenga spoke in the Assembly Room on Thursday night.

 

By Suzann Gries
Staff Writer

Dr. Maulana Karenga, chairman and
associate professor of the department
of black studies at California State
University in Long Beach, Calif., criti-
cized filmmaker Spike Lee for his por-
trayal of Malcolm X in his new movie,
Malcolm X.

“I’m concerned about Malcolm and

how people use Malcolm,” Karenga I

said during a speech at the University
of Pittsburgh Thursday night.

Karenga said Lee is degrading him-
self by using Malcolm X to make
money. h

Hollywood has made Malcolm X into
a commodity instead of a “world histor-
ical being,” Karenga said.

Karenga also criticized rap artists. He
said that rap artists must recognize the
limitations of rap music.

“You can’t just make a revolution by
singing. Make the revolution, and_a
song will come by itself,” Karenga said.

Karenga said that the educated black
community has a special responsibility
to other members of the community to

be positive role models.

He also said African Americans must
be aware of the truth of their history.

“If we have no knowledge of our
own history, then we doubt our own
humanity,” Karenga said.

Karenga criticized the political system
in the United States and the recent
election. He said there is no role in the
Constitution for African Americans or
Native Americans. -

“They can vote all day like they did
[Nov. 3]. It’s not going to change any-
thing for our lives,” Karenga said.

Karenga criticized President—elect Bill
Clinton for discussing racial division
and hatred in this country.

“It is wrong for the oppressor to
stand in the midst of the oppressed and
lecture about hate,” he said.

Karenga said that although some
people’s spirits are lifted by the out-
come of the election, Clinton is not his
hero. And the African-American com-
munity does not have a president yet.

Karenga, an author of several books
and articles, including Introa’uctz'on to
Blacle Studies, is the creator of the
African-American holiday Kwanzaa.

Slovakian Americans celebrated their
heritage yesterday afternoon at the
Slovak Heritage Festival in the
Cathedral of Learning. The event was
sponsored by the University of
Pittsburgh Student Slovak Club.

While men and women posed for
pictures in traditional Slovakian dress,
dozens of dolls, books, brochures and

clothing displayed the ethnic culture of

Eastern Europe.

One brightly—embroidered vest,
belonging to Marge Metsko, was 125-
years old. A white Sunday head dress

met and interacted with poten-
tial employers from companies
in Pittsburgh and other parts
of the United States at the
African-American Job Expo
Thursday afternoon.

Over 70 companies, includ-
ing AT&T, IBM Corporation,
Mellon Bank and .USAir, Inc.,
participated in the event spon-
sored by the Black Action
Society.

“The [job expo] is good
because the companies can get

it’s good because they get to

what they are looking for,”

munications major, said, “I
came here to make some con-
tacts, to learn some important
information and to get an
overview of the present posi-
tions opening up for commu-
nications majors.”

According to AAJE coordina-
tor Alisa Moseley, some ‘com-
panies actively recruit students
at the job expo. .

Moseley said she has had
positive feedback from the stu-
dents and the companies par-
ticipating in the AAJE.

from the same collection belonged to
Metsko’s friend’s great grandmother.
Metsko’s display also included
Slovakian corn husk dolls, painted
Easter eggs and ceramic pottery, in
which the paint color determines from
what part of Slovakia it originated.

Former Slavic language student Mary
Gido and Slavic language department
administrator Chris Metil made replica-
tions of Slovakian textile patterns dur-
ing a weaving demonstration.

“We got a grant from the
Pennsylvania Council of the Arts for an
apprenticeship to learn to preserve the
old—style craft of fabric-making,” Metil
said. “We travel to New Jersey, Chicago

— anywhere they have Slovak festi-
vals.”

Weaving has been part of Gido’s life
for many years. “I’ve made all sorts of
wall hangings, and I’m now working on
a tablecloth,” Gido said. “My grand-
mother made me do this. She had nails
on her back porch with thread hanging
from them and we used to sit there and
make rag rugs.”

On the other side of the Cathedral
Commons, Pittsburgh Slovakian mem-
ber Mary Lipchak spun flax from
konope, a plant harvested in Slovakia
to make cloth.

“In Europe in the old days, people
used to make bed sheets and under-

clothes for men and women out of
konope,” Lipchak said. “But there was a
lot of hard work before these things
were made. The konope had to be
soaked for two weeks, then dried,
raked and bleached with wood ashes
before it could be woven into material.”

The Steel
Corporation also had a presentation at
the festival.

“Homestead has one of the largest
Slovakian populations in the United
States,” Slovak Club member Jeff Cosko
said. “Most of the Slovakian immigrants
worked in the steel mill. The steel mill
has played a big part in their relatives’

Enterprise crew beams
down to tbe Pitt Union

By Frank Porco
Staff Writer

Captain Kirk and the entire crew of the Starship Enterprise land-
ed in the William Pitt Union Assembly Room last night.

More than 200 students showed up for the Star Trek Fest where
fans viewed bloopers from old “Star Trek” episodes and tested
their knowledge about it in a trivia quiz.

Jason McCright, film director for Pitt Program Council, said the
idea was to vary the films to cater to different students’ tastes.

“It was a chance to show something more varied while still hav-
ing a ﬁlm for students. It struck me as a good idea,” he said.

McCright said that a lot of students were interested in it, that
people called after seeing various ﬂyers around campus.

McCright attributes the interest in the Trek Fest to the fact that
there had not been much going on in the area concerning the
interests of “Star Trek” fans. _

“I can’t recall the last time there was a Star Trek convention in
the Pittsburgh area. I thought that there might be some interest in
that area,” McCright said.

McCright said he also thought it would be a good idea to have
the convention to see how interested the students are in “Star
Trek.” If there was a positive response to the presentation, PPC

Underdog film festival

ﬂies into the Bee/aive

By Stephen Liss
Staff Writer

Super Chicken was almost caught by the Zipper. A vicious gang-
ster shot a load at Tennessee Tuxedo. The Canadian Mounties got
their man. Sound like fun to you?

Then you should have been at the Beehive in Oakland Saturday
night when about 40 people gathered to take part in the Underdog
Film Festival. ‘

It was all laughs as the 90-minute ﬂick, featuring the super canine
himself, entertained a crowd filled mostly with students and_older
cartoon fanatics.

Thirty—two—year-old Brian Halgas was so enthusiastic about the
show, he came alone.

“No one wanted to come with me,” Halgas said. “I saw the ad in
the paper for the midnight show, and I just had to come.”

Halgas sat in an isolated corner of the theater with his hands on
his head, laughing non-stop. “You don’t see cartoons like this any-
more,” Halgas said. “I used to sit and watch Rocky & Bullwinkle,
Super Chicken and Underdog religiously when I was a kid.”

The way the crowd participated, people would think it was
karaoke night at the Beehive. Rows of people cheered on their
favorite superhero while-_singing the lyrics to their favorite cartoon

might try to focus future pro-
grams toward science fiction.

Bob Lucas, who ran Pitt’s Star
Trek Fest, travels all over the
country presenting his program
to comic book and Star Trek
conventions.

“The response is really good,
these people are a hard-core
group who are really involved
in it,” Lucas said.

Lucas said that the success of
the “Star Trek” episodes is due
to a very simple plot to follow.
He also said that the characters
are good, and you can become
really involved in it.

The “trekkies” or “trekkers,”

as the devoted fans of the “Star
Trek” episodes like to call
themselves, are drawn to it
because it is fun.

“People just love it, it just hits
home. It’s like a classic rock
station,” Lucas said.

Lucas said another reason
“Star Trek” fans are so drawn
into the old episodes is the
familiarity of the characters.
The set of characters consists of
a diverse group of people and

centers around how theylhan-,

dle situations.

The shows open the eyes of
viewers to the close—minded-
ness that leads to bigotry,
McCright said.

“Anyone who thinks the
show is simply about setting
your phaser on “stun” should
watch the show more closely,”
he said.

E “George of the Jungle is my
favorite,” Dan Hammel said as
he sang a few lines.
“George-George—George of
the jungle, friend of you and
me. George—Geo7ge—George of
the jungle watch out for that
tree!”
The 36-year-old Hammel

reminisced about watching
Underdog when he was
younger. “When I was six or
seven the first cartoon came
out. I fell in love with it right
away. But when I watch them
now, it’s not just for the enter-
tainment. You can see the
political messages and underly-
ing themes in every skit.”
Manager Chris Colpo said he

thinks not enough people real-
ize that the Beehive is featur-
ing Underdog.

“We thought more people
would show up,” Colpo said.
“Friday night we had an aver-
age crowd, tonight we expect-
ed more. You would think
more people would want to
check it out.”

Colpo also said that nobody

seems to understand that the
Beehive is a movie theater that
sells coffee.

“We show movies and clips
like Underdog all the time,” he
said. .

In case some people missed
it, never fear — Sweet Polly
will be calling Underdog to the
Beehive until Thursday. This
week’s shows start at 9:45 p.m.

“We also look for interns, peo-

Marife Ramos, a recruiter
from Teach For America, said
that her company specifically
targets the AAJE because
African-American students are
more aware of the plight of

minority students in the
schools.

“We’re recruiting individuals

said.

When asked for further
explanation, George said
that he was not ready to
comment for The Pitt News.
After intermission, the
crowd whistled and clapped
to Lashawn Conner and
Lamman Rucker’s love song
“If This World Were Mine,”
while Men of Distinction
followed with a slow rap
called “What’s the Plan?”

Then the Assembly Room
grew quiet as Katrina
Williams softly sang “Loving
You.”

Talent show winner
Claudene George received a
standing ovation for her
performance of “God Bless

tion, Harris asked the audi-
ence “Did she kick it?” to
which the crowd replied,
“Yes, she did!”

the audience with both gui-
tar and vocal solos. Missy
Copeland rapped while two

Ready  action

Congratulations President—elect Jacob Brody and all
the other Student Government Board representatives
who won on November fourth. Enjoy the euphoria of
your victories now because the time will sooncome for
action, and we hope that the next board is prepared to
meet the challenges ahead.

The SGB serves a very real purpose on campus -— to
act as a representative for the undergraduate campus
community.‘ Unfortunately, the board is surrounded by

  _two opposing forces: (1) an apa_thetic student body and;

(2) _a university administration which is capable of hold-
ing the role that SGB plays down to a minimum. ’

r We hardly advocate an exchange of power from the
Board of Trustees to the SGB. Nevertheless, this does
not mean that SGB, as representative of the student
body, should accept decisions with only minor inﬂu-

_; ence. On the contrary; when an unpopular decision is

handed down, SGB should be willing to use its inﬂu-
ence and organize protests. Not only will this make the
administration answerable to the general student popu-
lation, but it could also go a long way in reducing the

student apathy that we hear so much about.

One thing that we think SGB should involve itself

T with "is Operation Jump Start. It is a program that

Governor Casey has funded for the enlargement of this
university. A convocation center is to be built,'a class-
room complex and a new mainlibrary. How, where
and why the funds are being allocated where they are is
something SGB should make sure it is consulted on.
Secondly, the university has made massive strides
regarding cultural education on campus. The SGB,
much to its credit, has been an intricate part inthis
development. However, the board must go further. With
all the attention being dedicated to an increasingly inter-
etl1nic campus, SGB should continue to lobby hard for
the establishment of a cultural center on campus.
Cultural issues, however, do not stop with the .devel—

‘ opment of a University of Pittsburgh cultural center.
. SGB should make an effort to find out whatever hap-

pened to the dollar tuition raise for a Study—Abroad
scholarship fund that passed in a student referendum
about a year ago.

Not only is the scholarship fund important in itself,
but it involves a deeper question. To what extent do the
upper echelons of this university listen to undergraduate
concerns? Here is something that was convincingly
passed by the students in a referendum and was virtual-
lyignored by the administration.

We hope that students on this campus will be able to
say, at this time next year, that the previous Student
Government Board had an impact on their life as Pitt
students. Safety is important, and the previous board
made much headway there. But it’s time to get off of
that safety bandwagon and start addressing other issues.

Malcolm X and -his divine message

Why is it that in a European
perspective, Malcolm X, a black
leader, is feared or resented?
Why is it that the political and
spiritual ideology of Malcolm X
and those Africans who are at
union with his struggle are per-
ceived with scorn or disdain by
the majority of the European-
American population, including
the media and governmental
power structures? The answer is
one which is simple. By his very
essence, Malcolm X, who is a
black Muslim, denounced the
racial ignorance, hypocrisy and
economic supremacy of the
European race. Malcolm
achieved this by realizing a true
union with Allah (God). and by
regurgitating this knowledge to
the African mass in America.

Any time someone assumes
the role of leadership for his/her
people, this person is bound to
come under scrutiny of system-
atic powers. This was the case
for Malcolm X. Even further as a
black Muslim, which is deviant
from the Westem-Christian force
which dominates the United
States, Malcolm X was also held
suspicious for his spiritual
stance. By adopting the spiritual-
ity of Islam, Malcolm X asserted
black pride as a divine gift of
Allah. He attempted to show
Africans that their advancement
as a race relied primarily on this
very concept of self. Malcolm
said, “...A race of people is like
an individual man; until it takes
its own talent, takes pride in its
own history, expresses its own
culture, affirms its own S€lll1OOCl,
it can never fulfill itself.”

For the European racist or
supremacist, this statement
poses numerous problems. For

one, Africans who were made '

slaves shortly after the European
colonization of America were
denied any contact or practice of

their indigenous culture as a
method of mental enslavement.
Secondly, the teachings of
Malcolm make a distinction
between the culture of the
African and that of the
European. .
African culture, which ultimate-
ly seeks to unite its people
through love and pride, con-
trasts the intention of the
European Imperialists, who,
with Christianity as their guide,
conquered and divided the
African continent.
Malcolm X wanted Africans to
be aware that they never
crossed the Mediterranean to

Ras Oscar
Eybers  

steal and divide the European
continent, as European culture
had done to Africa. Secondly,
Africans did not cross the
Atlantic Ocean, as Christopher
Columbus did, to practice the
same act of land thievery toward
the indigenous American peo-

ples. And thirdly, Africans, as"

imposed by Malcolm X, did not
enslave millions of human
beings and make extinct certain
human populations, such as the
Arawak of present—day Jamaica,
as acted out by the European
culture and tradition.

Once more, I ask, why is
Malcolm X a threat to the
European population in the
European colony of the United
States of America? With the force
of his religious convictions, he ,
in turn, forces the Europeans to
re-examine the brutal and sav-
age means which they under-
took to attain their power. To
the Africans he said, “All of us
have suffered here, in this coun-
try, political oppression at the
hands of the white man, eco-

nomic exploitation at the hands
of the white man and social
denigration at the hands. of the
white man.” A I ‘

Malcolm X, by utilizing the
events of world history, actually
put the European population in
a state of self-denial. Which
European, other than the self-
proclaimed racist, would admit
to having the brutal colonization
of Africa and the majority of the
world as a part of his/her per-
sonal heritage? Which European
could accept into his/her per-
sonal heritage, that forefathers
enslaved and killed millions of
humans, simply because they
believed these human beings to
be culturally inferior?

If the European conscience is
not clear, this is not an easy task

.-— especially for those who

believe that wearing black

I clothes or growing long hair is

an excuse to sit on the sidelines
of the black struggle.

Through an Islamic spiritual
path, Malcolm X asserts that the
global African population must
look within itself for purposes of
pride and survival.

History has shown that this is
the opposite intention of the
Europeans, for if they were to
aid the Africans in such a
process they would denounce
both themselves and their cul-
ture. As for the prestigious
European psychologists, political
scientists, religious leaders,
anthropologists, educational
leaders, environmentalists and
even the common population,
Malcolm X asks them exactly
what they are doing, who they
are-doing it for and if there is
any-multicultural truth in their
missions.

Ras Oscar Oliver Eybers is a first-
year student majoring in black
studies. ‘

"Everyone on campus knows there is student apathy. I believe there are
several reasons for this: a lack of interest, a lack of knowledge and a
lack of understanding. " .

 KICKED OUT

  Seton Hall ends Pitt ccer’s dream season 5-1



1?.

By Brian Gallagher

Sports Assistant

The dream .season is over.

In just its second appear-
ance in the Big East final four
tournament, the Pitt soccer
team fell to defending confer-
ence champion Seton Hall, 5-.
1, last Friday in Storrs, Conn.,
ending the most successful
season in Panther history.

Five goals from five differ-
ent players powered the
Pirates (11-66), who went on
to lose the league champi-
onship game to St. John’s
University, 2-.1 yesterday
afternoon. .

Pitt ended the year second
in Big East play and finished
with the most wins ever by a
Panther soccer team (12-6-1).
This all came after going win-
less inthe league last year. "

For Pitt head coach Joe‘
Luxbacher, the loss does not
take away from a tremendous
season, but that season does
not make it any easier to
take.

“[The loss] doesn’t take.any-
thing away from the season,”
Luxbacher said, “but we’re,
disappointed to end on, that
note.”

Seton Hall jumped to a-1-O

"lead just 11 minutes into the
game on a goal by. Michael
‘Magarinos. Aftertaking a pass

from forward Carmine
Pascarella, Magarinos fired .a
17-yard blast past Pitt goalie
Adam Spitzer for the score.
Pitt would even the score a
minute later when another
Michael — Panthers’ senior

defender Bacasa — scored off
passes from Carsten Bishop
and Ted Noethling.
But afterthat, it was all
‘Hall.’ '
Goals

by Carmine

Pascarella and Steve McKee

within a three—minute span
staked the Pirates to a com-
manding 3-1’ advantage. Pitt
never recovered.

“The first 25 minutes we
played really  well,”
Luxbacher said. “But as soon
as they scored that second
goal, « the whole game
changed. '

“I don’t know if the word is
panicked, but we played
undisciplined for the remain-
der of the game.”

The second half was more

of the same — Pitt pushing to

get back into the game and
Seton Hall capitalizing on
mistakes for goals.
Second-half goals by back-
up midfielders Steve Whelan
and_ Todd Jacobs closed out
the scoring for the Pirates.
Pitt was limited‘ to five shots
in its last half of the year.‘
Getting behind to a precise,
talented team like the Pirates
spelled. .1-o—s—s for the
Panthers -——, a team that prides
itself on a conservative, disci-
plined style of play.
I “When you’re down a cou-

.ple o_f goals, you have to

open it‘ up a bit,” Luxbacher
said. “They wereimore active
than I thought.”

knee injury, Seton Hall main-
tained strong offensive pres-
sure throughout the game. In
fact, the key to the Pirates’
pressure» was Echeverry’s
replacement ——- Raul Barroso.
According to Luxbacher, the
play of the sub actually made
the ‘Hall a better team. How?
The Pirates did not rely on
the star to get the job done.
“The guy they put in for
Echeverry played much,
much harder than
[Echeverry]/’ Luxbacher said.

For The Pitt News

This past weekend, the Pitt
men’s swimming and diving
teams turned two slow starts
into two more victories as
they rolled over James
Madison University and St.

dual-meet record to a perfect

3-0. .

On Friday night, Pitt hosted
James Madison in its first
-home meet of the year. The
Panthers got off to a slow start

‘ against a surprising James
Madison squad. After five
events, Pitt was trailing by 13
points to JMU. But in the sixth
event, the one—meter diving
competition, the Panther div-
ing team took over.

Led by an outstanding per-
formance from captain Sean
Braud, Pitt -captured the top
three spots and brought the
Panthers even in the meet
with James Madison.

Men's swim and dive

“I was extremely pleased
with our performance
tonight,” Diving Coach Julian
Krug said. “All the guys did a
great job tonight. We are right
where I want to be this early

J, in the, season.”

, The Panther divers not only
tied up the meet, but also
brought the big crowd to life
and seemed to set the tone
for the rest of the meet.

“The large crowd was really
a big plus for us,” swimmer
Matt Brady said. “They got us
really excited and helped us
out a lot.”

James Madison regained the
lead in the next event, but the
Panthers stormed right back
in the 100.yard freestyle..Pitt
swimmers Eric Fortner, Zach
Economos and Eric Stull were
tested the whole way but
went on to sweep the top
three spots and give Pitt its
first lead of the evening. The
Panthers never trailed again.

Pitt’s Matt Brady dominated

takes two

the next event, and the
Panthers led by five points
going into the 500 freestyle,
which would turn out to be
the most exciting race of the
evening. .

The race featured three lead
changes, as Pitt’s Gary Mule
and JMU’s Rich Roland battled
each other from wire to wire.
Roland led Mule with 50 yards
to go, but Mule started gain-
ing on the leader, eventually
catching him with only 25
yards to go. Mule kicked it in
high gear and pulled away
from Roland, taking the victo-
ry and bringing .a roar from
the crowd and the team.

“That race was very nerve-
racking,” Mule said. “He took
the lead from me, but I
caught him at 50 yards..From
there my training took over,
 I knew I could take him.”

. Pitt won two of the last

three events ——- including

another top-three sweep in
SeeM. Swim, page9

 

“Actually, I thought it made
them a better team.”

Overall, Seton Hall ‘outshot
Pitt 15-7. The corner kicks
were even at six apiece.

While the ninth-year_Pitt
coach admits that the better
team won, he doesn’t think
the score is indicative of his
team’s capabilities. He
noticed that his team had a
slight case of the nerves, but
does not ‘use that as an
excuse for his team’sless-

' Riding the record-setting ‘per-
formance of sprint specialist
Becky Okoniewski, the homes-
tanding St. Bonaventure
women’s swim team defeated
the Pitt women’s swimming and
diving team, 164-136, handing

the Lady Panthers their first loss

of the 1992 season.

Despite stellar efforts from its
talented core of first- and sec-
ond—year athletes, Pitt (1-1)
could not overcome the strong
swimming and diving" of the

.entire St. Bonny lineup — in
particular the performance of
Okoniewski.

A junior freestyle specialist,
Okoniewski broke two Reilly
Center pool records Saturday
afternoon — posting record
times inboth the 200—yard med-
ley relay and the 200 freestyle.

For Pitt head coach David
Belowich, the difference in the

weekend. .

“Seton Hall’s ‘a better team,”
Luxbacher said. “They’re not
five to one better, but they
are better. ’ ’

“We’re typically a relaxed
bunch. I noticed before the
game how quiet we were-.
I’m sure there were nerves,
but it’s no excuse [for the

loss].”

“Sometimes you think

not. It just didn’t happen-

ability_to jump out in front in
individual races and hold on for
the wins. ’

“They outraced us, plain and
simple,” Belowich said.
“Overall, we had some races

.where we jumped out in front

and swam hard. But there were
other [races] where we were a
little bit hesitant — coming’
from behind.

“They did a nice job.”

The Panthers stayed within,

striking distance for the dura-
tion of the meet, thanks to the
wqrk of swimmers Christy
Knobloch, Jill Patla and Laura
Zdyb and divers Sunday
Lewandowski and Kara Sixbury.

Knobloch won the 100 back-

stroke, placed second in the '

200 backstroke and took third
in the 100 butterﬂy. Patla — a
sophomore transfer — finished
second in the 50 freestyle and
fourth in the 100 butterﬂy.

Volleyball takes care of
business against Hoyas

By Cory Walborn
Senior Staff Writer-

If a tie is like kissing your
sister, then a tie that takes
days to break might just be
like kissing your dog.

That canine situation is

_ what faces the Pitt_volley-

ball team as it awaits the
decision from the Big East
Conference Commission on
who will be this year’s Big

I East regular season champi-

on.

Pitt, Providence and Seton
Hall are now deadlocked
with 5-2 records in the Big
East. With Seton Hall elimi-
nated by virtue of losses,
both Pitt and Providence are
waiting to find out who will
be the victor in a decision
that will be made today.

“We have to get the final
scores from both schools
[Pitt and Providence] before
we make our decision on
Monday ltodayl,” a Big East
spokesperson said.

That decision is only nec— .

essary because of Pitt’s thor-
ough whipping of

When the pressure was
on, the visiting Panthers
rose to the occasion against
the Hoyas. Led by an array
of players, Pitt soundly
defeated the home-court
hounds of Georgetown 15-
11, 15-9, 15-4.

Heading the cast of char-
acters in the Panthers’ win
was junior outside hitter
Ann Marie Lucanie. Lucanie

had a team-high 15 kills‘

against the Hoyas and only
committed two hitting
errors. "Her hitting percent-
age was also an outstanding

“Am [Lucanie] has just

nomenally well.”

Lucanie continued to play
well in all ‘areas of the

and added two service aces

sive and defensive heroics.

dle hitters. Both Sarah Mikla
and Alyssia Yanik helped
relieve some of the double-
block pressure that Lucanie
faced against Georgetown.
Mikla and Yanik both had
six kills and exploited Hoya
middle hitter Heidi West.

“Our first-year players
continued to improve,”
Braziel said. “And that takes
a lot of weight off of Am’s
[Lucaniel shoulders.”

With Lucanie on the out-
side étnd the combo of
Mikla/Yanik in the middle,
the job of setting was made
a lot easier.

Sophomore setter Annie

"Mernagh had 41 assists and
. changed the hitting schemes

at will. b
Having the offense and
defense motoring of all

cylinders, the games got
easier as the match went on.
But in game one the
Panthers were sluggish.

“In game one we were
very streaky,” Braziel said.
“Our passing and serving
hurt us.”

The score, (15-11) in game

« one, showed the slow start.

But things got better as
Lucanie and Co. took

_ control and slowed down

the Hoyas “big
German import
Kollman. _

The two-time All-Big East
selection was held to only
nine kills and a lowly .167
hitting percentage.

By winning the final two
games (15-9 and 15-4), Pitt
did its part to stake a claim

gun‘, I!
Shnone

to the Big East regular sea-

son title. After the victory, *

the Panthers could only
hope for Syracuse to beat
Providence. Syracuse com-
plied and beat the Friars in
a five-game marathon
match.

With the possible Big East
champion Panthers coming
off the high of beating
Georgetown, they fell hard
yesterday.

Losing to Maryland 15-12,
(8-15), (10-15), 15-6 and
(13-15), Pitt lost the crucial
fifth rally—point game.

Lucanie came through
again for Pitt with 21 kills,
and first-year player Sara
Mitchell added 13 to the los-
ing cause. Lucanieland
Mernagh played well defen-

sively, 14 and 12 digs
respectively, but could not
hold off the hungry
Terrapins.

Maryland, 18-7, was led by
Andrea Oakes and Sherry
Smith. Oakes had 18 kills
while Smith contributed 14.

The loss dropped the
Panthers’.overall record to
13-11 as they turntheir
attention to this coming
we~ekend’s William and Mary
Tournament. After that
season—ending contest, Pitt
will host the Big East
tournament on Nov. 21 and
22.

Awaiting the Big East’s
ruling on the regular-season
champion, the Panthers
could be the top seed or
the second seed in the tour-
nament for the Big East
crown.

Melanie Gustafson and the Panther volleyball team smashed Georgetown Saturday.

took third in the one—meter.
Sixbury took second and third,
respectively, in the two events.

Of the top swim perfor-
mances, Belowich was particu-
larly taken by the efforts of

. Zdyb. The sophomore distance
specialist won the 1,000
freestyle, took third third in the
200 butterﬂy and placed run-

ner-up in her final event — the
200 individual medley;

“She swam really well,”
Belowich said of Zdyb. “Laura

is sort of like a freshman. With .

being out early last year with
mono, she wasn’t able to swim
until [last year’s

Invitational.
“She really took control of
the race — went right out in

Pitt] ’

front and took control.”
Another positive in the Pitt
defeat was the continuing
improvement of the first-year
swimmers. Pitt’s Class of 1996
accounted for three first-place

finishes against St. Bonaventure ’

— one from Susan Poorbaugh
(500 freestyle) and the other
two from breast-stroke special-
ist Jill Fletcher.

Fletcher won both the 100
and 200 breast stroke. She also
won the praise of her coach,

who said that Fletcher’s early-

season success has helped to
fill a void that seemed unfill-
able this summer — namely
replacing graduated Pitt star
Laura—Lee Sullivan.

. “I was really, really happy
with the efforts ofljill and

all our freshmen,” Belowich
said, “When you lose a swim-
mer like Laura—Lee Sullivan,
someone has to step up.

“Jill has embraced that role
[of breast-stroke specialistl.”

SWIM NOTES: The Panthers
open their 1992 home schedule
this Friday afternoon against
Virginia Tech. The meet will be
at Trees Pool at 2:00 p.m.
