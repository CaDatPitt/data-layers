Posvar Scores Shapp ’s

By RICH HARRY

Pitt News S? iff wm '.‘|'

Chancellor Posvar has termed
Gov. Shapp’s proposal to maintain
Pitt’s current level of state
appropriations “another step in a
backward march for the Common-
wealth” that will “obviously” lead
to tuition increases and program
cuts at the University.

Posvar’s statement Wednesday
followed the govemor’s announced
budget recommendations for the
coming ﬁscal year. The proposal
includes hold-the-line funding for
the state-related universities.

The University had asked the
state for $70.9 million, but Shapp
recommended $60.5 million, the
same amount the school was tagged
for last year.

Posvar said the governor's
figures, if approved, would be “a
threat to the very concept of
low-cost public higher education”
in the state.

Budget Recommendation   

“A decision to give the univer-
sities no increase is a decision to

pass along nearly all the costs of ‘

inflation to students and their
families, ’ ’ he said. “Another result
will be to close off educational
opportunities for more Pennsylvan-
ia students of moderate means.

“I cannot believe that the people
of Pennsylvania want to see public
higher education crippled in this
manner.”

Posvar noted that approval of the
budget also would mark the third
consecutive year Pitt would receive
no increase in state funds, which
ﬁnance one-third of the University’ s
operations. During that period, he
added, inﬂation has increased costs
by more than 18 percent.

“Obviously,” Posvar said. “it
will necessitate tuition increases
and further program costs.”

He also expressed concern for
Pitt’s medical school, which has
received no appropriations increase
the past six years.

Baylson Gives
Opinion On
Shapp Budget

By TOM KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer

“Things are not looking good,”
Student Government Board Pres-
ident Josh Baylson told board
members in reference to Governor
Shapp’s proposed budget. The
governor’s budget, announced
earlier this week, was the opening
topic at the new board’s first
meeting last night.

“I fear we as students are being
used in a game of politics, ” Baylson
said.

Shapp’s budget restricts state-

colleges and universities to current
spending levels.

The budget would appropriate
$60.5 million for Pitt this year, the
same as last year’s amount. Pitt
had requested $70.9 million.

» Baylson indicated an increase in
tuition could be expected for spring
session and the coming fall term.-

ROTC Vote Put to Mail Ballot by CAS Council

By MAGGIE McKAY

Pitt News Staff Writer

The College of Arts and Sciences
Council yesterday withheld a

' formal vote on accreditation for

ROTC courses and referred the
issue to a mail ballot. Four of the
11 Council members were absent.

If passed by both CAS and the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the
motion would allow academic credit
limit. This is in accordance with a
current ruling which allows a CAS
student to count 12 non-CAS
credits toward graduation.

ROTC cadets must take 16
additional credits for a total of 136
to meet graduation requirements.
CAS students are required to take a
total of 120 credits for graduation.

Results of the ballot will be
announced at the next CAS Council
meeting in two weeks.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences
voted to abolish ROTC accredita-
tion on December 3, 1968 at the
height of the Vietnam war. Efforts

~to renew accreditation in the past

10 years have failed. Last year,

ROTC students launched a massive
petition drive for accreditation,
collecting some 2,000 student
signatures in favor of accrediting
the program’s academic courses.

Debate at yesterday’s meeting
centered on several issues, includ-
ing whether Pitt’s military science
department is similar to the
department in Pitt’s professional
schools.

“The Department of Military
Science is a different creature.
Pretending it is just another

Two senators and 17 state
represenatives from various dis-
tricts in Allegheny County attended

designed to inform the legislators of

missions procedures, and student

profession isn’t accurate,” Council
member John Townsend said.

“Asymmetry begins with the fact
the department’s purpose in life is
to develop ways of settling disputes
by force, unlimited force if
necessary.

“My comments are not anti-
military. This campus is very
receptive to ROTC and the program
is ﬂourishing without credit.
We’re deﬁnitely against treating it
as just‘ another profession and

that’s what I think academic credit
means,” Townsend said.

Council member Larry Epstein
spoke in favor of ROTC credit
“with safeguards.”

“Let’s be reasonable on this
matter. Let’s act in favor of
students taking these courses.
We’re not letting that much go as
long as we stick to the 12-credit
limit,” Epstein said.

Should CAS pass the measure,
ROTC accreditation will be placed
as an agenda item at the FAS
Council meeting Feb. 28.

Shapp Budget Main
Item at SAAC Meeting

By SUE McFARLAND

Pitt News Staff Writer

Discussion of Gov. Milton

Shapp’s proposed state budget“

dominated Wednesday’s Student
Affairs Advisory Committee
(SAAC) meeting.

The group, which included
Chancellor Posvar, administrators
and student representatives, ex-
pressed concern and disappoint-
ment with an inevitable tuition hike
and $2.5 million program cut that
will be levied in July unless the
Legislature revises Shapp’s pro-
posal, which holds the line on state
appropriations for Pitt and other
state-related universities.

‘ ‘It would be grossly unfair for the
students and their families to bear
the entire burden of this _(in-
c'“rease),"’ said Edward Bozik,
executive assistant to the Chan-
cellor. “We will therefore do
everything humanly possible by
way of program reductions, and
attrition, as well as cuts in travel
and supply allowances.

Bozik said the appropriation
Shapp recommended is $2.8 million
less than what had been anticipated
by the administration. To defer a
tuition hike, he added, there must
be an increase in state appropria-
tions somewhere in excess of six

Brains and Brown
By The Associated Press

PITTSBURGH—Cheerleader Juanita Phillips envied boys with
varsity letters, so she earned one with her brains at the only school
in town where scholars and atheletes earn the same reward.

“I saw mostly boys with varsity letters and very few girls, so I
decided I wanted one,” said the Oliver High senior honor student,
who wears a big, orange ‘O’ on her blue denim jacket.

“Some of my friends call me brainy, but I’m proud of it,” she
added. “It shows I’ve worked to earn something.”

It takes a ‘B’ average for three straight terms in a single school
year to qualify for Oliver’s academic letters. Not too many of the
high school’s 1,250 students qualify.

“Not a lot of people have one,” said junior Steve Tresky, whose
letters for golf and volleyball hang in his room at home while he
wears the academic letter to school.

“I’m really proud to wear it. I think a lot of other people wish
they could have one,” Tresky said.

It was just such pride that counselor Raymond Deiss hoped to
instill when he suggested the letters six years ago.

“We wanted a program that would start kids striving toward
academic excellence,” he said, recalling bitter racial strife that
overshadowed learning at the racially mixed school in the early
1970’s.

“But it couldn’t be something just for the very smart kids. It had
to be something the average student felt he could achieve.”

Eleven Soviets Ordered Out of Canada
for Spy Recruitment Attempt

By The Associated Press

OTTAWA—-Eleven Soviet officials have been ordered out of
Canada for trying to recruit-a top ofﬁcer of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police (RCMP) as a spy, Foreign Secretary Don J amieson
said yesterday.

He told the House of Commons two other Soviet officials who are
out of the country now will not be allowed to return.

The Foreign Office told Soviet Ambassador Alexander Yakolev
yesterday four of the 11 officials still in the country must leave within
48 hours and the other seven by Feb. 23.

J amieson told the Commons the alleged spy activities ‘ ‘represent
a serious set back to our bilateral relations. This incident and the
action we have had to take today will inevitably place strains on our
relations with the Soviet Union.”

Otto J elinek, a member of Parliament, claimed in 1976 that there

were “espionage agents” in the Soviet embassy.

_He said the RCMP had told the government many Soviet secret
police KGB agents were operating in Canada.

J amieson said the high RCMP officer the Russians allegedly tried
to recruit was paid $30,500 for information of “no consequence.”

He said the RCMP officer, who had previous contact with Soviet
officials in the “normal course of his responsibilities,” had been
offered “an unlimited amount of money” to spy for.the Soviet
Union. The ofﬁcer hadcome into “infrequent contact” with one of
the Soviet officials involved in the case during the Russian’s earlier
posting to Canada.

Jamieson said the government wanted to keep the name of the
ofﬁcer conﬁdential, and added the RCMP investigation that led to
the expulsion order began last April.

He said, “The important point for the House to note, however, is
that this case has involved no compromise of Canada’s security.”

The foreign secretary said the Soviet spy activity in Canada had
included microﬁlmed messages to the RCMP officer in a
hollowed-out stick and a specially prepared pack of cigarettes.

He said he was ofﬁcially advised of the RCMP investigation last
month but delayed taking action while the Mounties concluded the
probe. J amieson said the decision to expel the Russians was made
when he returned from a visit to China this week.

Convicted Nazi War Criminal Dead

By The Associated Press

SOLTAU, West Germany—Convicted Nazi war criminal Herbert
Kappler, whose escape from a Rome prison hospital and ﬂight to his
German homeland caused‘ a furor last August, died yesterday of
stomach cancer. He was 71.

Kappler was serving a life term for the mass execution of 335
persons in reprisal for the killing of 32 German soldiers by Italian
partisans on a Rome street on March 24, 1944, a date observed now
in Italy as a national day of mourning. He was the Gestapo chief of
Rome at the time.

He died at the home of his wife, Anneliese, 55, who had helped
him escape. '

West Germany refused an Italian request for his extradition,
citing a constitutional restriction against extraditing German
nationals. That refusal sparked a wave of criticism in several
European countries. Some demonstrations were violent, forcing
cancellations of a long-planned meeting between West German
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and Italian Premier Giulio Andreotti.

The West German government had petitioned Italy several times
to release Kappler on humanitarian grounds but Italian authorities,
under pressure from former resistance ﬁghters and Jewish groups,
refused. Some of the. hostages ordered killed by Kappler at the
Ardeatine Caves near Rome were Jews.

Kappler’s wife said in interviews after the escape that she
lowered him from his Celio military hospital room window to the
ground with mountain-climbing gear. His weight had dropped to 97
pounds because of his cancer.

Mrs. Kappler was quoted in a German newspaper Sunday as
saying she put her husband in the luggage compartment of her
waiting car after lowering him to the ground an.d then drove across
the border into West Germany. She said it was dark at the time and
“nobody could see anything.”

Seven Soviet dignitaries visited
Pitt Wednesday night as part of a

The dignitaries, accompanied by

descriptions of the rooms given in
Russian by tour guide Cynthia Roll,
a senior Russian major.

was to have been on campus early
Wednesday afternoon but a snow-
storm held it up in New York.

The dignitaries are in the United
States for a joint meeting of the
United Nations Association of the
Soviet Union and the United States.

Following the tour of the
Nationality Rooms and a brief tour
of the campus, Chancellor Posvar
hosted a dinner for the group in his
Bruce Hall suite.

The party stayed in Pittsburgh
Wednesday, night and ﬂew to
Harrisburg yesterday to meet with

A proposal currently before the
USSR Academy of Sciences pro-

faculty members between Pitt and

approved, would allow two Pitt
professors to teach in the USSR and
two Soviet educators to teach here.

A high-ranking member of the
USSR Academy of Sciences and

chairman of the Institute of USA

Wednesday’s visitors, and one Pitt

initiated programs as a prelude to
their vote on the school’s state
appropriations.

During the discussion that
followed a presentation of recent
pathological advances, Senator
Paul Dufﬁeld and other legislators
directed questions on the nature
and extent of the University’s
involvement in that ﬁeld to Dr.
Peter J . Janetta, chairman of the
department of neurosurgery. Dr.
J anetta pointed out that Pitt has the
busiest neurosurgery service in the
country.

After explaining the admissions
process, Dr. Paul Gaffney, newly
appointed Director of Admissions
and former director Dr. Francis

Drew ﬁelded questions from the
legislators. Senator Thomas Nolan
questioned faculty and alumni
inﬂuence in the selection process.

“We keep the selection process
essentially free from any pressure
effects,” Gaffney responded.

The question of increasing

enrollment at Pitt's Medical School
was also reviewed. Gaffney and
Drew rejected the idea. They based
this position on the lack of lecture
halls, laboratory equipment and
teachers to provide personal
interactions.
: “We would be graduating
incompetent doctors,” said Gaff-
nev. V

Representative Charles T. Logue

from the Oakland area said the lack
of physicians was a major problem.
A medical student, Vince Lombardi,
pointed out the problem is a lack of
proper distribution.

“Doctors ﬁnd city practice more '

desirable, leaving rural areas
without proper medical care,”
explained Drew. I

The legislators proposed the idea
of state money as an incentive
device to correct this lack of
physicians.

The medical students escorted
the legislators on tours through
Children’s Hospital, Presbyterian
Hospital, _surgica1 observation
domes, gross anatomy lab, self-in-
struction center and research
laboratories.

The State Budget

Blizzard or no blizzard, it is little wonder Gov. Shapp chose to
deliver his ﬁnal budget message from the seclusion of a public

1 television studio.

The $60.5 million appropriation he slated for Pitt is more than

' $10 million less than what the University administration had

requested. If Gov. Shapp’s budget passes the Legislature intact,
Pitt will be saddled with no increase in its state appropriation for
the third consecutive year.

Chancellor Posvar has called the Governor’s proposed level of
university funding “a threat to the very concept of low-cost public
higher education in Pennsylvania.” We wonder what he means. In
view of Pitt’s ranking among the most expensive state-related
universities in the country, there’s really little left to threaten. The
concept of “low-cost public higher education” was obviously
abandoned in this state a long time ago.

Still, we agree with the Chancellor’s basic concern. Tuition, it
has already been announced, will be raised this spring-—perhaps as
much as six percent. Last fall, it went up eight percent, or $50 a
term. This September, if Pitt receives no more than the Governor
has suggested, another hike is inevitable. v

Putting together a few statistics, evidence can be found in the
budget for the unfortunately low priority given to Pitt’s ap-
propriations request. Although total spending under the Gover-
nor’s general budget {would increase seven percent—to $5.78
billion-—there will be no increase for Pitt. While state funding as a
whole will keep up with inﬂation, funding for Pitt (and other state-
related universities) will not.

Put simply, funding priority is not given to state-related univer-
sities. Over the three years in which Pitt will have received no in-
crease in appropriations, inflation will have raised costs 18 percent,
nearly‘all of which must be absorbed by tuition. “More and more,
students with what the Chancellor calls “moderate means” are
priced out of the educational market.

1 "E 8% til‘:-. assets itwalvea til il‘ii§ ‘yearia Budget is a reenact-
ment of last year’s “hostage” situation, in which Pitt, Penn State,
Temple and Lincoln suffered a delay in receiving state funding.
Although the universities were awarded no increase in funding as a
result, some persons may still identify the recent tax increases with
exorbitant appropriations for higher education.

In 1978, Pitt and the others could actually find themselves cast as
villians again, caught this time in a battle for funds with public em-
ployee unions. There is no money in the Governor’s budget for pay
boosts for state workers, even though many contracts are up for
renegotiation. '

Of course, University appropriations may still be raised. Pitt
and the other schools now have the opportunity to go before the
State House and Senate to request more money, but it is too early

‘ to tell how receptive the legislators will be. Because it is an election

year, lawmakers will be reluctant to budget increases in
tuition——but they may be more reluctant to do anything that might
lead to the need for higher taxes. Again, the prospect of a
stalemate, another “hostage” situation, looms on the horizon.

Legislators must be convinced that something more than what
the Governor has proposed should go to the state-related univer-
sities. With inflation, no increase in university appropriations is, in
effect, a six or seven percent cut. Students cannot continue to
make up the difference. -

Much will depend this year on the efforts of Pitt’s lobbying
team.‘ Now is the time for the University’s professional lobbyists to
get moving. And now is the time for the Student Government
Board to gather its forces and start putting what pressure it can on
Harrisburg.

Letters to the Editor

General Peled and the Palestinians

Although Ifully agree with many
of the criticisms of Julie Graham’s
article contained in the three letters
you published on Monday, Jan. 30,
it is regrettable that the authors of
all three letters seemed to feel that
the Palestinian problem could be
disposed of just by showing that it
is not solely the result of Israeli
“oppression.” Regardless of who
did what to the Palestinian Arabs in
1948, the Palestinian issue remains
at the center of the Middle East
crisis, and the Israeli government
has so far shown few indications of
any positive approach to it.

The authors of the three letters
you published on Monday all seem
to assume that Israel is justiﬁed in
refusing to have any dealings with
the Palestine Liberation Organiza-

tion and in refusing to consider the
possibility of an independent
Palestinian state. Yet, as the
former Israeli general Mattiyahu
Peled has argued in an interview in
the most recent issue of the New
York Review of Books, “The
Palestinians may not be strong
enough to bring about their own
solution to the conﬂict, but they
will always be at least strong
enough to block other solutions. ” If
Israel is to avoid cohtinuing to rule
over a subject population of nearly a
million stateless Arabs indefinitely,
some more constructive approach
to the Palestinian problem must be
found.

I unqualiﬁedly condemn ‘the
P.L.O.’s terrorist tactics, just as I
deplore the Israeli bombing raids

on civilians in the Lebanese
refugee camps over the years.
Nevertheless, Peled clearly is right
when he says that the P.L.O. will
not publicly renounce such tactics
as long as Israel gives them no
incentive to do so by promising to
participate in negotiations in which
the P.L.O. is represented. To be
sure, the P.L.O. has never won an
election in the occupied territories:
Israel has rigorously suppressed all
pro-P.L.O. activities there since
1967. Despite heavy Israeli pres-
sure, however, candidates sym-
pathetic to the organization won
the most recent local elections in
the West Bank, and no genuine
alternative leadership has emerged
there in the 11 years of Israeli

Civil Suits Get Expensive

ByMARKMURPHY

Some troubling news came forth
from California earlier this week,
the type of news that observers fear
indicates a dangerous trend has at
last come to its zenith.

An Orange County Superior
Court jury ordered the Ford Motor
Company to pay $127.8 million to an
18-year-old man for damages
suffered when the gas tank in the
Pinto he was riding in exploded.
Take a good look at that figure. You
may not see another settlement
ﬁgure like it again. But, you may
see it again, and that is just the
problem.

The jury awarded the victim
$125 million in punitive damages,
and almost ‘$3 million in compensa-
tory damages, for the injuries he
suffered in his accident nearly ﬁve
years ago. The man’s lawyer called
it “probably the loudest noise that
the jury has made in any civil suit in
American jurisprudence.” Ford,
which will appeal the ruling, called
the settlement “unreasonable and
unwarranted.” Both parties are
right.

The number of large-dollar
settlements has risen dramatically
in this country in the last 10 years.
In 1962, only one million-dollar
settlement was given. In 1969,
there were only three. In 1976, the
number rose to 43. Something is
terribly wrong, and people paying
insurance premiums are picking up
the tab for these bonanzas, while,
lawyers, heirs and dependents of _

. victims are‘, reaping the ‘profits.-

Dontthink all of these. awardlsj;
are for ‘victims of ‘debilitating 
crippling, accidents}. 1 _  

the Ford suit has undergone 52
operations since his accident, and is
entitled to compensation. But one
woman was granted just over $1
million to compensate for her
“depression, anxiety, nervousness,
phobia, fears and nightmares.”
The reason for all this distress? She
was arrested, tried and found
innocent of being a shoplifter.

Never before would someone ﬁle
suit on such ill-defined grounds as
“mental distress” or “depres-
sion.” But this now is a common
practice.

Who wins whensuch awards are
handed down? The ﬁrst person to
turn cartwheels is the triumphant
lawyer. Many lawyers do not work
for standard fees in large lawsuit
cases. If his client wins, the lawyer
takes a hefty percentage of the
settlement. Some lawyers live for
the chance, and work for years on
one case when they get that chance,
to win a whopping case and be set
ﬁnancially for life.

The other winners in the lawsuit
game are any heirs or dependents of
successful] plaintiffs. Take, for
example, the Ford case. How is any
one person going to spend $128
million in his lifetime? His medical
expenses and living expenses, even
after a large settlement to his
lawyer, probably don’t equal $128
million. Where will the rest of it go?

Probably into the hands of
interested parties or shysters who
have done no more than suffer
mentally.

Since a jury found Ford
negligent, Ford must compensate

do? so to the tune of $128 million

:3 ’r.*éj'>r'- -\_. ‘-.~\‘--7"’

ddllars does rnothignpgg buptgopgen the

ﬂoodgates to more big-money
lawsuits, some of which may be
legitimate, but too many of which
will be fraudulent.

A fairer _price for Ford to pay
would be to have it pay all expenses
for its victim. And I do mean all
expenses. The man would never
want for anything, medically or
ﬁnancially. One can live a very nice
life these days on much less than
$128 million. Many countries would
live very nicely these days on $128
million.

To make Ford pay an exorbitant
amount of money does nothing to
serve the ends of either plaintiff or
defendant. The young man still will
carry the scars of 52 operations
along with his fat wallet, and Ford
and other companies will pay
monstrously high insurance costs,
all of which will come back to
consumers in the form of price
increases. Those same consumers
will also see an increase in
insurance premiums.

The greatest good for the greatest
number should be, and can be
invoked here. An entire public
should not suffer because of an
overly sympathetic jury. Give the
young man, and all victims of
negligence, everything and any-
thing they need in their lives. Don’t
extend the same courtesy to lawyers
and heirs. And, above all, don’t
give negligence victims more than
they could ever use in a hundred
lifetimes.

Putting a monetary value on
human suffering and human life is

Student Film-Makers Bring Hollywood East

 

Bv BARB THOMAS
Pin News Staff Writer

“As a student at Pitt, I
absolutely do not have enough
facilities to make ﬁlms,” said
student ﬁlm-maker Sam Choi. “But
through Pittsburgh Film-Makers’
Society, I do.

“Pittsburgh Film-Makers is the
largest ﬁlm cooperative in the
country,” said Choi, a bio-chemis-
try major, who is also assistant
curator at Carnegie Film Institute.
“People come from all over the
country to use its facilities.”

A Pittsburgh Film-Makers mem-
bership is $100 a year. The only
stipulation is that a member cannot
use the society’s equipment to make
a commercial ﬁlm.

Students interested in ﬁlm should
contact Pitt’s Franklin Pangborn
Film Society, according to Choi.

“First off, the Pangborn Society
is an outlet for love of the cinema,”
Cho'i said. “Second, it has a
ﬁlm-making club that offers some
ﬁlm equipment, ﬁlm and process-
ing. The Pangborn Society also
works with Pittsburgh Film-
Makers. It holds commercial
viewings of Film-Makers’ films,
and Film-Makers offer free mem-
bership to one or two members of
Pangborn.”

Choi said he wishes Pitt offered
ﬁlm-making courses. “There are
not‘ that many people who stay
interested in ﬁlm because it takes a
lot of time and money,” Choi said.
“However, there are deﬁnitely
some people at Pi_tt who are very
serious, and who end up going to
different schools.”

Two professors at Pitt who are
working on a ﬁlm studies program
are Marcia Landy and Bruce
Goldstein. There are 15 to 20 ﬁlm
courses, most in ﬁlm appreciation
and theory, offered at Pitt each
term, according to Goldstein.
However, these courses are offered
in a variety of CAS departments,
including psychology, Far Eastern
studies and English literature.

“We are trying to get money to
hire a coordinator, and make ﬁlm
studies a studies just like women’s
or black studies,” Goldstein said.

“Film theory classes are impor-
tant because if a student doesn’t
have background in ﬁlm, he is going
to make something that someone
else made 20 years ago, and still
think he's being original,” Gold-
stein said.

Pitt is a good place for a ﬁlm
studies program because “you can
see as many non-commercial ﬁlms

in Pittsburgh as in other cities,”

said Goldstein.

CAS students
ﬁlmmaking class at Pittsburgh
Film-Makers must pay double
tuition, the lab fee at Film-Makers
and the fee to have their credits
transferred, according to Goldstein.
SGS students must pay only a lab
fee.

who take a

“It would help to have these
credits paid for for CAS students,”
Goldstein said. “I think there’s
room for a good number of Pitt
students at Film-Makers.”

Goldstein, who teaches a psy-
chology of ﬁlm class, said he feels
“Student ﬁlmmakers are trying to
say something. A shot can be very
expensive. You might shoot 60
minutes of ﬁlm and then edit it
down to a ﬁve-minute ﬁlm.”

Student ﬁlmmakers now can use
an inexpensive “Super 8” camera,
developed from home-movie cam-
eras. “Students can make a ﬁlm
using the cheaper camera, than
have it transferred to 16mm ﬁlm.
That is the size. used for
documentaries,” Goldstein said.

Landy, who teaches a ﬁlm course Q

in the English department, said, “I
offer one of two choices—write a
journal or make a ﬁlm. Students
borrow equipment from the audio-
visual room at Hillman Library. 1
am always very pleased with the
results.

‘‘In the course Women in Film,
some theater majors made a ﬁlm
about what it is like for a woman to
be admitted to Western Psych,”
Landy continued. “Some of the
other students made documentaries
that were comic and avant-garde.



They developed a reasonable scope, )w

of women in society.”

Other student ﬁlm subjects have
included a P.J. Lovecraft story and a
motorcycle convention, according to
Landy.

“Every year I sit in the class and
think the ﬁlms are going to be
awkward or amateurish, but they
don’t turn out that way at all,” said
Landy. “The students have no set
formulas for making ﬁlms, so they
are generally quite original. This is
especially exciting for students who
have never made ﬁlms before.”

One problem in ﬁlm classes,

according to Landy, is that students ‘

do not realize ﬁlm can be critiqued,\u‘V'

just like literature. “There’s a great
resistance in realizing ﬁlm is not
just entertainment.”

Butt Out— Woes of a Classroom Nonsmoker

By DAVE MCDONALD

' Pitt News Staff Writer
Dld you ever come home after a

long day and evening with smelly
clothes and hair, sore eyes and a
nauseous feeling in your stomach?

Although this may describe what
one feels like after working a double
shift in one of the local mills or
running behind a PAT bus for ﬁve
miles, these symptoms also may
appear after a long day (and
particularly evening) in — a- Pitt
classroom.

Besides smelling bad and feeling
rotten, the nonsmoker has to put up
with dirty ﬂoors that substitute as
ashtrays, burnmarks on desks,
bumholes in clothes and windows
that have become translucent due to
cigareet smoke. If you happen to
drop your hat or coat in a Pitt
classroom, chances are it will come
up dirty because of all of the ashes
on the floor.

Although smoking in areas
posted with “No Smoking” signs is
illegal, the law is enforced about as
much as are jaywalking ordinances.

According to Thomas Kennelly,
Pittsburgh ﬁre chief, the University
is responsible for enforcing the no
smoking law in areas where
smoking is prohibited.

“The law may be dated, but there
is still a definite ﬁre hazard present
when there is smoking in a room,”
Kennelly said.

If campus police decided to arrest
a law-breaking smoker, the offen-
der would have to appear before
Pitt’s Judicial Board, just as do
other persons who commit offenses
within the University. '

Although the days of high school
bathroom busts are over, and
students can smoke in classrooms

without the fear of having to
swallow cigarettes during a campus

police raid, smokers should realize
that they not only make the
classroom ﬁlthy, but also degrade
the health of nonsmokers.

It has been known for years that
smokers greatly increase their
chances of getting lung cancer (in
1976, 68,000 of the 84,000 deaths in
the U.S. from lung cancer were
caused by smoking), coronary heart
disease and emphysema, but only
recently has research been com-
pleted to show the harmful effects of
tobacco smoke on a nonsmoker in a
closed area.

The greatest physical damage to
nonsmokers from tobacco smoke
comes from the smoke that is not
inhaled by the smoker. This
“wasted” smoke contains ﬁve

times as much tar and nicotine as
inhaled smoke. The smoke
streaming from the end of a
cigarette contains four times the

amount of carbon monoxide as
smoke that has been inhaled and
expelled.

Studies on smoking show that in
closed areas, within an hour (a
period of time equal to a class
period), 70 percent of nonsmokers
feel one or more of the following
effects: eye irritation, nasal
problems, headache, cough or sore
throat. Also, harmful chemicals
such as ethyl, nitrate (a carcinogen)
and carbon monoxide are found in
the bloodstreams of nonsmokers
after they have been in a room ﬁlled
with tobacco smoke. The studies
also proved people who do not
smoke have higher blood pressure
readings and higher pulse rates

after exposure to a smoke-ﬁlled
room.

Smoke from cigars and pipes

often is more offensive to non- 3;!"
smokers than cigarette smoke. This 

kind of smoke can be more irritating
to the eyes, nose, throat and
breathing passages. Pipe and cigar
smoke also contains their share of
damaging chemical compounds,
such as benzopyrene and phenol.
Tests show that the pollution from
one cigar equals that from ﬁve
cigarettes.

. Eliminating smoking of all
k1nds—cigarettes, pipes and cigars
—-is one way to help clean classroom
air. and to protect bodies and

Students smoke because they think
they need to, their bodies know
better. Any exposure to tobacco
smoke is hazardous to your health.

Indian Hopes To Headdress Carter

By The Associated Press

DETROIT——An aging Cherokee
Indian, voiceless because of throat
cancer, is asking President Carter
to change his mind and accept a
handmade feathered headdress
like theone he has given to every
elected president since Woodrow
Wilson.

Chief Redbird, 78, and convales-
cing in a Detroit area nursing home
after surgery last year to remove a
malignant larynx, said he sent a
ieaddress to the White House
shortly after Carter was elected.

But because of Carter’s policy of
accepting no gifts from the public,
:he headdress, made with turkey
feathers, was returned.

Now a group of the chief’s
friends and relatives are trying to
arrange not only for the president
to accept the headdress but for
Carter to receive it in person from
Redbird, if the Indian’s health
improves sufficiently to make a
meeting possible.

There has been no reaction from
the White House on the request.

thinking about presenting the

“This bonnet isn’t a gift. It’s a

“The chief didn’t send one to

Ex-Olympian’ Rudolph: 1
Women Separate But Equal

ByKARENKADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer
Former Olympic gold medalist
Wilma Rudolph, speaking at a
lecture in the Student Union
Wednesday, said the United States

should maintain “separate, but
equal. sports programs” for
women.

Rudolph, who fought back from a
childhood polio attack to become the
first black woman in Olympic
history to win three gold medals (in
1960), referred to a new Ohio law
allowing women in that state to
compete in all men’s athletic
programs.

“Women’s programs today are
becoming better,” Rudolph said.
“I’m all for women’s programs.

“We can’t compete with men in
all sports. We have fought all this
time to establish women’s pro-
grams. We’d be defeating our own

purpose if we competed against the

men.

“We’re feminine,” Rudolph
continued. “We’re taught to be
that way. I feel if women want to
compete against men, they should
be able to do it. They shouldn’t be
denied that right. But we still need
separate and equal programs for
those women who don’t want to
compete against men.”

Rudolph, whose life has been the
subject of both a movie and a book,
said the United States’ infatuation
with the way sports programs are
handled in the Soviet Union and
other East European countries is
overdone.

“We can’t worry about how
professional Russia is,” Rudolph
said. “Our athletes take it (money)
under-the-table. Everyone knows
that.

“It’s a situation that’s portrayed
wrong. We can’t compare our
system with Russia's. They’re two
different structures.”

Discussing the future _of the
Olympics, Rudolph said participa-
ting nations should attempt to keep
“world problems” out of the
games. Rudolph said she could see
no problems like the violence at the
1972 games arising in Moscow in
1980, because “the security there is
so tight.”

“The Olympic Games is one of
the most beautiful things in the
world,” Rudolph said. “The
chance to meet athletes from all
over the world is great. Sharing
these interests is one of the most
beautiful experiences in the world.

“World problems shouldn’t be
allowed to creep into an atmosphere
like this.”

Presidential Rhetoric Not Just All Talk

By LEONARD ROMBERG
Pitt News Staff Wﬂtﬂ’

In an age of supposed political
apathy, the most popular CAS
elective centers on politics.

The class is ‘1Presidential
Rhetoric” (Speech 118), taught by
Dr. Ted Windt, which has grown
from a class of 15 students to an
auditorium lecture of 400 students
in its eight’-year existence.

“The purpose (of the class),”
Windt said, “is to examine the way
in which Presidents persuade us to
believe in them, act upon what they
want us to act upon, support them,

and, conversely, how Presidents
have lost that support,” Windt
said.

Presidential Rhetoric started in
1970, as an offshoot of a graduate
seminar Windt taught on the
rhetoric of the 1968 Presidential
campaign. The speech department
was trying to build its under-
graduate offerings at that time,
Windt said, and someone sug-
gested making his seminar into an
undergraduate course.

Windt initially rejected the idea,
because the 1968 campaign alone
did not provide enough material for

a course. Then, he structured the
course to cover the campaign
speeches of the Kennedy, Johnson
and Nixon administrations.

Windt’s ﬁrst classes consisted of
students who were politically
active, he said.

However, Windt said students
political attitudes have become less
intense.

“When I of

was critical

Kennedy, the Kennedy supporters

would be vocal,” Windt recalled.

“When I was critical of Nixon or

Agnew, people who supported
them would be vocal. In both cases,

I would be called biased.

“Now, I see a much more
academic approach on the part of
students,” Windt continued. “Peo-
ple ask questions, but they are
different kinds of questions.

“Students now are trying to
learn what happened during a
period, rather than support or
oppose a particular President.”

Windt said he feels people today
are tired of politics.

“I have to deal with that, and
respond to the different set of
expectations students are bringing
to my classes,” Windt said. “It

surprises me to see this many
people interested in the class,
especially in a period where there
is not an excessive interest in
politics.”

Presidential Rhetoric always has

been exciting to teach, Windt said, ,

despite the repetition of much
of the same material each term.

“When we started the course,
Nixon had just come into the
Presidency, so we had four more
years of Nixon,” Windt said. “And
we had tremendous interest in
politics during 1973-74 with Water-
gate.”

Teacher Wills Thrusts Fencers Along

By ED BURKE

The room is long, narrow and

the game is no longer played here.
The walls and ceiling are white,
and the room is brightly lit with
ﬂourescent lights. Leaning against
the far wall is an archery target; the
rest of that wall is covered with a
heavy white curtain (for stray
arrows). This is the archery and

fencer’s sword shines and reﬂects
the bright lights above them. For
twenty minutes, Wills coaches his
student on how to parry, thrust and
stab. When this series of move-
ments is executed successfully and
Wills is considered “stabbed,” he
moves back and the student
attempts the series-movement
again.

They move from one end of the
room to the other, the student
advancing and Wills backpedal-
lign. Fencers don’t just strike at
each other’s swords—their swords
“sing” like two violin bows playing
each other. Wills talks to his
student almost constantly, some-
times murmuring, other times
exclaiming. His black eyebrows can
be seen through his mask at close
range; the brows occasionally leap
when the student shows unex-

pected proficiency in a movement.

The thrust (parry, thrust and
stab) must be one ﬂuid movement
requiring constant balance. Mas-
tering the thrust takes much
practice. If you are fencing and
have a sword in your right hand,
you must push aside your
opponent’s sword with you own
(parry), kick your right leg forward
(thrust), and at the same time
extend your sword arm (stab). Your
body will lean forward if the
movement is done wrong, making
you off balance. Leaning forward
can be disasterous because you
cannot backpedal away from your
opponent’s return thrust. In a
“real” fencing duel in which the
loser is either wounded or killed
(duels are illegal today, of course),
losing your balance would cost you
your life.

In a modern duel, the object is to
score points. Each fencer’s sword
has a spring-loaded tip; when a
fencer touches his opponent with
the tip, the touch is registered
electronically on a scoreboard. The
epee (one of the three types of
swords-the other two are the foil
and the saber) has a “blood
gutter” that is deep enough to fit a
small wire that runs from the tip to
the sword hilt. The wire, loosely
wound around the fencer’s arm to
the ﬂoor, eventually connects to the
scoreboard. Four judges look on to
determine if a touch has landed
within the body limits of a
legitimate score. (Any touch is
good with epees——with foils, the
limits are from the groin to the
neck, excluding the arms.) A score
stops the duel momentarily.

Wills, 35, is a fencing Master of
Armes and a coach for the U.S.
Olympic fencing team. The Eastern
Conference of the Olympic team
meets one weekend a month to
practice, in either Philadelphia or
New York. Wills and several other
members of the coaching staff are
training the Eastern Conference
team for the upcoming 1980
Olympic Games in Moscow.

The cost of equipment (sword,
mask and glove) for recreational
fencing is about $75. If your are
serious about fencing and wish to
become a fencing Master, the
equipment cost is higher.

Thin Lizzy and Nazareth

By M. PATRICK MONAHAN
Pitt News Staff Writer

lreland’s Thin Lizzy and Scot-
land’s Nazareth, both with recent
albums, are bands whose ships for
stardom have lately sailed into
rather uncertain and choppy
waters.

Both bands seemed on course for
rock stardom in 1976, when Thin
Lizzy’s “Jailbreak” and Nazareth’s
“Hair of the Dog” were certified
gold albums.

 

Their dilemma is a common one

in the music industry: How do you
please an audience that is willing to
root for you when you are under

 ~ rigs, but that demands more as
‘“ "your fame increases?

Thin Lizzy followed the success of
“Jailbreak” by launching their first
headline tour of America in the
summer of 1976, drawing huge
crowds in every city they played.

Thunder Island

By JIM FARERI
Pitt News Staff Writer
Thunder Island

F»- u-av--
- --g..-.,--

Many people know Jay Ferguson
has a big FM hit in the title track of
his new album, “Thunder Island.”
What many people don’t know is
Ferguson was formerly the key-
board player in Spirit, and this is
his ﬁrst solo album.

“Thunder Island" was recorded
in Coconut Grove, Fla. Away
from the Hollywood-New York
hype, in a lazy, uneventful hamlet
unfrequented by deadlines, insis-
tent managers or obnoxious group-
ies, Ferguson has created the easy
rock album of the 1970's.

That is not to say this album is
ff ‘bout its hooks and foot tappers.

-2-as". ‘

Then, Thin Lizzy’s leader—bass-
ist, vocalist and songwriter, Phil
Lynott—contracted hepatitis, side-
lining the band.

Problems continued into the fall
with the “Johnny the Fox” album.
A clumsy recording, it reﬂected the
friction that had arisen between
lead guitarist Brian Robertson and
the other members of Thin Lizzy.

“Robertson would come into the
studio, play his guitar parts as
quickly as possible, not even listen
to them played back, just so he
could retake his place on a stool
down the street at the local boozer, ”
said Lynott.

While bad luck can be blamed for
Thin Lizzy’s recent problems.
Nazareth’s can be traced to the
inconsistency of their albums.

Nazareth’s “Hair of the Dog”
release, containing the single
“Love Hurts,” built up quite a
following for them. But the band
hasn’t since put out an album that
comes close to “Hair of the Dog” in
quality.

If Nazareth is inconsistent, their
behavior during an interview with
them in November might echo the
reasons why.

Following their stint on the bill
with Kansas, Nazareth’s lead
vocalist, Dan McCafferty, and the
band’s two road managers seemed
more intent on getting back to their
drinks and mates in the hotel bar

“Just put down that we're a rock

On the strengths of their latest

There are two kinds of songs on
the album: straight light rockers
and rock-reggae tunes. The _best
examples of the former include the
title track, “Babylon” and “Losing

to be an apt songwriter of mature
rock when given the chance.

Almost all the light rockers
feature strong melodic guitarwork.
“Losing Control,” the song on
“Thunder Island” most remini-
scent of Spirit, offers some tight
guitar jamming.

The rock-reggae numbers in-
clude “Cozumel" and “Happy

album not written by Ferguson.
Both tunes are executed with the

Crackin’ Shows
Style On New LP

By PHILIP SCALAMOGNA
Pitt News Staff Writer
Crackin’
Crackin’
Warner Bros

One of last year’s premier
groups, Crackin’ came onto the
music scene exhibiting a pleasant
soul-pop sound with strong ele-
ments of jazz and funk. Their latest

album, “Crackin,” reveals
intelligent composition in musical
material, both in vocals and
instrumentals.

The music does not possess a
great deal of innovation or
originality when compared with
other types of soul-pop music, but
Crackin’ has developed a pleasant,
personal style.

Crackin’ features two guitarists,
Brian Ray and Bob Bordy. Rick
Chudacoff plays bass, while Arno
Lucas and Leslie 0. Smith work on
vocals and percussion. Lester
Abrams, in addition to vocals, plays
the clarinet and acoustic and
electric piano.

The two remaining members of
the eight-man band are the
drummer, Peter Bunetta, and G.T.
Clinton on the organ, Moog, and
Fender Rhodes.

The eight musicians that make up
the group seem to have a knack for
organization. Nearly all of their
numbers are integrated well.
Drummer Peter Bunetta and Lucas
and Smith on percussion combine to
produce a crisp, moving beat that
sets the tempo of each song.

The brass is also ~ utilized
efficiently. The horns are not
overpowering, but sharp and

discreet, moving hand in hand with
the beat. The guitars come into the
foreground only in a couple
selections, yet the work of Ray and

Bordy is always discernable. Their .

tight jamming gives body and form
to all the selections, making each
song a cohesive unity. Finally, the
vocalists, Abrams, Lucas and
Smith, show they are fine singers,
giving melody and character to their
music. '

The best tune on “Crackin,”
“The Force Is Watching You,”
exhibits a vivid beat, a lively bass
and ﬂowing brasswork. “Fallen
Dancer,” “Do You Need More
Time” and “You Know Where I
Am” all have a funky sound.
Michael Omartian’s piano on
“Fallen Dancer” adds some spice
to the selection.

The guitar work shines on “Do
You Need More Time,” where the
two guitarists emerge from the
background and play some em-
phatic, rhythmic chords. “You
Know Where -I Am” has a sweet
arrangement of ﬂutes and a rich alto
sax by Stemsey Hunter.

Two other good cuts are “Don’t
You Wish You Could Be There” and
“You’ll Feel Better.” The former
has a nice rolling beat and crisp
brasswork, making for a nice pop
selection. “You'll Feel Better”
reveals ﬂuid guitar work.

Throughout all the selections
Crackin’ reveals a certain sophisti-
cation and organization in its style
that should appeal to many. The
musicians have developed a nice
sound and they would do well to
record another album like
“Crackin.’ ” I

Swan Lake: Flawed, But Good 

By SALLY RAPPEPORT

Pittsburgh Ballet Theater ended
its 1977-78 season with the popular
classical ballet “Swan Lake.”
Though 100 year old, Swan Lake
continues to be performed by ballet
companies all over the world.

Its ﬁrst performance in Moscow

in 1877 was a disaster, causing
Tchaikovsky to believe he had no
talent for composing music for
ballets. After the initial failure,
Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov
re-staged the ballet. For the most
part, Pittsburgh Ballet Theater’s
version follows the traditional
Petipa-Ivanov choreography.

The first act of the ballet opens
with the peasant celebration of the
Prince’s twenty-ﬁrst birthday. Full
of pantomime and peasant dances.
the beginning tends to be boring.
However the Pittsburgh Ballet
Theater livened the scene using a
well-executed waltz, following the
Royal Ballet choreography. The

waltz had varied and interesting
spatial patterns which covered
much of the stage.

Act II began with a smoke-
covered stage creating the illusion
of a misty lake. Here the swans
make their appearance. Though
they danced adequately, the corps
de ballet did have a few problems

Coming after the ethereal

such Queen classics as “Killer
Queen” and “You’re My Best
Friend,” and echoes from the II st
break through in “We Are The
Champions.” The poetry in
“Champions” is not up to par, but

theemphasis on vocals rather than

elaborate musicianship makes for
an interesting variation.

The other song bound for Top 40
infamy is “We Will Rock You,”
such a complete concession to the
new wave that a “Rolling Stone”
reviewer claimed it belonged in a
Leni Riefenstahl footage of the
Nuremberg rallies. “We Will Rock
You” does work well, but lacks the
energy characterizing punk music.
It's ﬁne for Queen to try it once, but
not to build an album on. An
established band can shift styles

successfully——look what disco did,

for the Bee Gees—-but it would be a

mistake for Freddie Mercury to
regress back to the Johnny Rotten
stage.

“News of the World” is an
obvious break from Queen’s
familiar operatic style, but the
transference period (which actually-
started three years ago with a blast
into hard rock in “Sheer Heart
Attack’ ’) is awkward. Queen should
be onto a new and distinctive trend
with their next release, but “News
of the World” sounds too unﬁnish-
ed and transitionary.

Chatham: “The Turning Point."
Anne Bankcroft and Shirley
McLaine as two aging dancers, one
who chose marriage, the other who
chose fame.

Fulton: “Which Way is Up.”

which detracted from their per-
formance.

At times they drooped in their
poses. The shapes and lines were
not always deﬁnite, and, most
importantly, the transitions be-
tween variations were not smooth,
causing the scene to drag.

Eleanor D’Antuono, guest artist
in residence with PBT this season,
played the role of Odette, the lead
swan with whom Prince Siegfried

V falls in love. A member of New

York’s American Ballet Theater,

D’Antuono has received critical-1:3

acclaim for her performances in
many leading roles. But as Odette
in Swan Lake she did not
consistently capture the essence of
the character of the swan.

In Act III her part called for a
complete change in personality.
She played Odile, the daughter of
villainous Baron von Rothbart, who
is disguised as Odette to trick the
prince into marriage. Her move-
ments were more aggressive and
sharper, but almost too harsh.

The third act, the ballroom
scene, had the most colorful
costumes and scenery. A variety of
folkdances—a Spanish dance, a
Mazurka, a Czardas and
Neopolitian dance—gave the scene I
a festive ﬂavor.

In the ﬁnal act of Swan Lake the
swan queen and Prince Siegfried
commit suicide, which is the only
way to break the spell of the evil
Rothbart. Flashing lights and a
ﬂoating swan chariot ended the
melodramatic ballet.

Cagers Come Back to Haunt Mounties, 87-76

ByJIMPANE
Pitt News Staff Writer

MORGANTOWN, W.Va.—Pitt’s
basketball Panthers let the ghost of
-Duquesne past haunt them for only
20 minutes Wednesday before
rallying to upend West Virginia,
87-76.

A scant WVU Coliseum crowd of
4,599 saw the Mountaineers (minus
the ﬂu-sidelined Maurice Robinson)
send chills up the Panthers’ spine
by dominating ﬁrst-half play and
taking an eventual 37-31 lead into
the intermission. As the half wore
on, the display put on by the

‘ball-static Pitt offense was evolving

into a reasonable facimile of the
88-66 . embarrassement by Du-
quesne three days earlier.

“We have to move the ball to be
successful,” Pitt coach Tim Grgu-
rich said after the game. “Sunday
against Duquesne, we didn’t move
the ball and shot 31 percent. In the.
first half today, we didn’t move the
ball and shot 35 percent; in the
second half, we did move the ball
and shot 77 percent.

The Panthers’ second-half a-
wakening allowed them to leave the
Coliseum winners for the first time;
it was a win that capped Pitt’s first
regular-season sweep of a West
Virginia basketball team since 1954.
_Pitt beat WVU, 71-66, at the Field
House earlier this year.

Terry Knight set the stage for the
second half by working the ball
inside and exploding for Pitt’s first
eight points. Knight's one-man
performance quickly resulted in a
39-39 deadlock, and WVU led only
four more times.

‘ ‘We feel we can go inside against
most ball clubs,” Grgurich said,
“and Knight’s four hoops got us
going. We were still feeling the
effects of Sunday’s game up to that
point.” ‘

Much of the Panthers’ success is
traceable to the job done containing
Mountaineer scoring leader Lowes
Moore (21.3 average). Grgurich
shufﬂed his three top guards——
Wayne Williams, Pete Strickland

and Knight— throughout the game
to keep fresh legs on the six foot-one
inch sophomore, which forced
Moore into taking low-percentage
shots. Although Moore was able to
connect for 22 points, he shot an
anemic eight-for-22 from the floor.

Pitt found itself in early foul

Larry Harris looks for an

trouble in the second half, and WVU
began shooting the one-and-one
with over 14 minutes to play.
Luckily for the Panthers, however,
WVU’s opportunities from the
charity stripe wouldn’t play a major
role in the outcome of the game.

Mountaineers for 24. The Panthers’

joining WVU’s Moore and Junius
Lewis.

Lewis had a technical tacked on to
his foul column to go along with two
consecutive technical calls on the
Mountaineer bench. The net result
was an easy five points for the
Panthers, who called on Harris to do
the free-throw shooting.

Besides the rotating guards
Grgurich employed, Pitt received
some much-needed help from its
bench. When Scheuermann found
himself in foul trouble, Wayne
Talbott took to the ﬂoor and
responded with two buckets in two
attempts. Dave Olinger got into the
act with a ﬁve-for-six showing and
12 points, joining three other
Panthers in the double-figure
category.

Harris tickled the twine for 27
points (and grabbed 10 rebounds)
after being shut down by the Dukes,
who allowed Pitt’s second-leading
career scorer (tied with Billy Kight
at 1731 points) only 10 tallies. Terry
Knight and Sam Clancy also hit
double digits, popping 12 and 15
points. respectively.

Clancy put on another startling
show, snagging a game-high 14
rebounds and proving he can play

something other than power[_

basketball——namely ﬁnesse basket-
ball.‘ Just ask WVU’s Tommy

Gordon’s Mat-uration as Wrestler Alive and Well at Pitt

By JIMLEWIS
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt 167-pound wrestler Jim
Gordon’s summer job nearly killed
him.

“The scaffold I was working on
collapsed,” he explained. ‘ ‘I didn’t
tie it right. It collapsed underneath
me and I just started falling, but I
was able to wrap my arm and leg
around the rope—I burned my arm
up pretty bad. But if I, hadn’t done
that, I wouldn’t be here now.”

Gordon is alive, as his first
collegiate pin in Saturday night’s
27-12 Panther victory over Lock
Haven proved. He has won five
individual matches in a row—run-
ning his personal record to 9-3—and
will be needed in Pitt’s two-day,
four-match road tour against
10th-ranked Cleveland State, Navy,
William & Mary and Maryland on
the east coast this weekend.

“A lot of people didn’t think
Gordon would do very well,”
Panther head coach Dave Adams
said. “ButI did. And he's matured
into a real ﬁne leader.”

Gordon’s pin, against Mike
Nauman with only 41 seconds
remaining, led Pitt from a close 14-9

score against the Bald Eagles to a
20-9 lopsided margin. I.ock Haven
never recovered.

But the task is tougher this
weekend. The 10th-rated Vikings
stand in Pitt’s way of first place in
the Eastern Wrestling League;

while Navy (23-14‘ ' losers... to ,
ﬁfth-rankedPenn sate).-Wimm a  _
Mary and Maryland caneasily ruin ‘

the Panthers’ so-far successful 7-3

. season. j V 
And what makes things worsefor ‘

Pitt and Gordon is the ﬂu, which,
coupled with injuries to 177-pound-
er George O’Korn and 142-pounder
Mike Bond, will cause the Panthers
to juggle their lineup to ﬁll the
voids.

“We’re going to have to
maneuver to a point where we have
the best lineup at the time, ’ ’ Adams

said. “We may have to make some
moves, shifting some of our
wrestlers, including Gordon. ’ ’

Last year, Gordon was switched
to the 158-pound ~s1ot—a move
which proved disasterous. He
ﬂoundered with a 3-9 personal
record.

“I had mental problems,”

Gordon said. ‘ ‘A lack of conﬁdence,
Ithink. At Temple this year, I got
very tired and was actually pinned,
against Bucknell. I wanted to tell
Coach Adams that I didn’t want to
wrestle the next match against
Temple. But I did, and won a very
close match, 13-11—I was able to
suck it up.”

Maxwell Improves Emphatically

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Ask Pitt freshman Glenn Max-
well and his wrestling coach, Dave
Adams, this question, and you’re
sure to get the same answer: How
much has Maxwell, who wrestles in
the 118 pound class, improved as a
wrestler this season?

Both Maxwell and Adams
answer an emphatic, “A lot.”

It took a comment by Lock Haven
wrestler Larry Moore, who bowed
to Maxwell, 14-7, during the
Panthers’ win over Lock Haven at
the Fitzgerald Fieldhouse Saturday
to remind Maxwell and Adams just
how much the defending high
school champ from Sharon, Pa. has
improved.

“(Assistant) Coach (George)
Bryant told me after the match was
over that Moore had come up to
him and told him how much
Maxwell had improved since he

" wrestled him in the PIAA semi-
ﬁnals last March,” Adams said.

‘.'The1_1. Moore ‘thought he could
have very easily beaten Maxwell.

Maxwell  just beat Moore by

one - point in‘ that match.

,_ "But, Saturday,” Adams con-

outclassed from the start. He more
or less conceded the match to
Maxwell. That fact more than
anything seems to be some
indication of the way Maxwell has
improved as a wrestler.”

Maxwell’s record also speaks of
improvement-the kind that has
helped the Panthers to a 7-3 record
heading into their home quadran-
gular meet with nationally ranked
Cleveland State, Navy and William
and Mary.

On the season, the ﬁve foot-four
inch grappler has posted an 8-5
record, with wins coming in the last
three matches over top quality
wrestlers from Millersville, Clarion
and Lock Haven.

“I’m a little more conﬁdent,”
Maxwell said. “I’m a little more
comfortable in my moves. Coach
(Dick) Ernst helped me move on my
feet more. I’m a little bit quicker in
that sense.

“I’m more conﬁdent in myself as
a college wrestler,_ too,” Maxwell

— continued. “No matter what you
tell yourself. college, competition is -
tough. You ﬁgure that all college .

-wrestlershave tobe good or they »
'wouldn’t be here. I’m just starting '

tinued,‘ ' “Moore felt he "was * toget used to that fact._’’

Adams sees conﬁdence and
momentum as big factors in
Maxwell’s improvement.

“He lost his match to Lehigh
right before he won those three
matches,” Adams said. “After he
lost that match, he picked up some
momentum. Our whole team did in
fact. This is a tough period as far as
our team is concerned. We know
the rest of the season is going to be
difﬁcult for us. But when you have
a wrestler who’s been improving
the way Glenn has, it makes the
season a little less tougher.”

Although two of Maxwell’s last
three wins have come against
wrestlers he faced in high school
(Moore and Clarion’s Jan Clark),
the freshman doesn’t see anything
special in the situation.

“It helps knowing something
about who you’re wrestling,”
Maxwell said. “But you ﬁgure they
had same kind of advantage in that
they know something about you.”

The weekend is going to be

tough for both. Maxwell and the

restof the wrestlers. Besides their
match on Saturday, the ‘Panthers
travel to Maryland, for a dual

' meeting Sunday.

Gordon has had a history of being
strong in the ﬁrst period of his
matches, earning lots of points and
then tiring in the end, many times
losing the match.

“Conditioning is just about
everything in wrestling,” he said.
“Once I tired in my matches, my

showed it.

technique was horrible—the 

“This year is just the opposite.
I’m 9—3——I’ve won ﬁve matches in a
row—and my conditioning has
improved 100 percent. I kept
working hard, wrestling about an
hour a night, and (former Pitt
177-pounder) Skip Bolin helped me
with my technique over the
summer.”

That practice helped make the

167-pound slot, once one of th ,

weaker points of the Pitt lineup, i

place where a decision could bet;

counted on a majority of the time.

“I’m 2-1 against league competi-
tion,” Gordon said, “ with the only
loss to Bloomsburg at the beginning
of the year. But that was not ‘Jim
Gordon’ wrestling in that perform-
ance. Now I plan to go to Maryland
(for the NCAA Finals) this year.”

Meanwhile, Gordon‘ will be
concentrating on helping out his
team—which will need help on the
out-of-state visit.

’ “I don't want to brag,” Gordog<-3;.

said, “but I feel that if! win, th“e~*"’

 Antics of WVU and Duquesne Fans LeaveA Bad Taste

Yell‘

Friday, February 10, l9‘78—THE PITT NEWS——Page 13

MORGANTOWN, W. Va.—Why is it the West
Virginia and Duquesne basketball fans are at their
obnoxious worst when the Pitt Panthers come to
play? Could it be the creative challenge posed-to
come up with as many obscenities as possible to
rhyme with Pitt? Could it be jealousy over national
recognition the Pitt football team has received? Or
could it be the way Cas Myslinski dresses?

Whatever the reasons, the fact is that a basketball
game with Pitt turns normal partisan fans into a
raucous mob, equally concerned with embarrassing
the Panthers as with the outcome of the game.

Since 1974, Pitt has provided these fans with many
hours of enjoyment, losing five of its last eight
against the Mountaineers and five of six games

" versus the Dukes.

Since each student section has been refining its act
for years, the time has come to evaluate each three-
ring circus and award the winner an autographed
photo of Mr. Tasteless, Larry Flynt.

0 First a look at the players: the Mountaineers en-
joy blasting Pitt as much as does Duquesne, but the
West Virginia players seem less inclined to jump in-
side a bun and spread mustard on themselves than do
the Dukes.

B. B. Flenory is the most recent and blatant
example of ballplayer turned frankfurter for his
taunting of Sam Clancy at the Arena. “Showman-
ship” is acceptable only in cases of justifiable
retaliation or extreme talent (when it becomes enter-
tainment for the fans). Flenory’s actions didn’t fall
into either of these categories. Clancy, however,
doesn’t’ seem to be the type to hold a grudge, and
might even give Flenory his autograph after signing
his pro contract. Because of Flenory, give Duquesne
the edge.

0 The coaches: John Cinicola, a hard worker,

battle, and a series of one-year contracts. Equally
gracious in victory and defeat, Cinicola is a man who
deserves a fate better than the one Duquesne
probably has planned for him.

Joedy Gardner, on the other hand, has been
known to pout after a defeat, perform some in-
credible antics on the sidelines (two technical fouls
were called on the West Virginia bench during Wed-
nesday’s Pitt win) and curse sportswriters for stories
he didn’t like. Gardner rates a bi ed e here.

   
  
    

   

   

 

._ ........ ,  _ 
0 The pep bands: the Mountaineer pep band is
comprised of musicians who keep the fans involved
in the game by playing fight songs and victory mar-
ches. All the music is well-played, and, to its credit,
the band doesn’t accompany the obscene cheers.

For a university that has a school of music,
Duquesne features a “pep band” that is a disgrace.
The six members of the Dixieland band use
microphones to project their sound, but the
placement of the mikes gives center stage to the har-
monic rather than the melodic line. Its rendition of
the national anthem sounded more like Hooterville
High’s alma mater. But, on the bright side, it would
bring a tear to Sam Drucker’s eye. In honor of the
Cannonball, give the nod to Duquesne.

0 The cheerleaders: Randy Newman would have
a field day with either squad, but the Mountaineer
cheerleaders are better organized and
choreographed. Duquesne has the single most attrac-

tive woman in either group, and could be the only
cheerleading squad in the country to have an injured
reserve list; one of the Dukes’ girls has a leg injury,
yet dresses for every game. Since there are far more
West Virginia cheerleaders, (with many more girls to
choose from) and the quality of the squads is not
much different, give the Mountaineers a slight edge
here.

0 The mascots: one must respect the Moun-
taineer for several reasons. He is in good physical
shape, looks the part he is playing and can take care
of himself if necessary, as the many opposing fans
who have unsuccessfully tried to steal his musket will
attest.

Duquesne’s Duke was not even on hand for the
opening tip-off of the Pitt game at the Arena. With
about five minutes gone in the first half, the Duke
came running onto the Arena floor frantically taking
off his topcoat. When he finally was ready for ac-
tion, the first words out of his mouth ordered Pitt to
munch on that inedible substance that composes 95
percent of the Bluff. For crudeness, the Duke comes
away with the vote. '

0 The fans: possibly an unfair area of com-
parison, since fans tend to be more obnoxious in vic-
tory than defeat. Mossie Murphy, Duquesne’s num-
ber one fan, at least keeps the students’ minds off
words that rhyme with Pitt. Mountaineer fans began
to show their poetic abilities nine minutes before the
game started, but turned their attentions to basket-
ball once the game started. Both sections are a mite
crude, but since Duquesne keeps it up for the entire
game, Duquesne deserves the nod.

And so, Duquesne wins the competition by a 4-2
margin. To both universities, congratulations on a
fine competition. To West Virginia, better luck next
year, both on the court against the Panthers and in its
ongoing battle with the Duquesne fans. ’

Illness Leaves Gymnasts Blue After Defeat By Orange

By CINDY NATALI

A wave of illness among the Pitt
gymnasts may have cost the team a
victory over Syracuse at the Field

_,fg;{guse Wednesday.

“Our team was very sick
tonight,” coach Frank D’Amico
said after the meet. “We tried to
do our job, but we couldn’t keep up
due to illness.”

With the score tied at 30.55 after
the first event, Pitt slipped behind
in the sidehorse event.

anther Terry Kniht stops and pops. V

Evangelista photo 7 -1 ’ '

“There were quite a few breaks
on the sidehorse and it just put us
too far behind,” D’Amico said.

The Pitt coach did not feel
Syracuse was particularly outstand-
ing saying it possessed strength in
a couple of individuals, but not in
any one event.

Despite the loss, D’Amico cited
several. team members for fine
performances. Tony Savelli did his
best job of the season in ﬂoor
exercise, and Frank Klein used
what was termed a new “superior

   

move” to finish his routine.

With no major breaks in his
routine, Allan Myers performed his
best in ﬂoor exercise, but received
a low score according to his coach.

“The judging was erratic,”
D’Amico said.

Ken Lunz hit his personal best on
the rings with a 7.0.

“When we bring up points from
our depth people (like Lunz), the
team points will come up,”
D’Amico said.

Dave Rich, also outstanding on

the rings established his highest
mark ever with an 8.05. Doug
Smith, participating in all-around
despite a bad abdominal muscle
pull, added his personal best in the
high bar. He ended his 8.8 routine
with a double somersault. in pike
position.

D’Amico is pleased that the team
is consistently scoring a higher
point total. In the early part of the
season, it was a struggle to hit 180
points, but D’Amico, who stated
this was the team’s worst meet,

believes that it is rewarding to see
the team scoring higher even in a
losing effort.

“We’ve got some tough road
meets ahead of us,” commented
D’Amico, who is expecting close
competition when the team meets
Kent State and Michigan today at
Kent.

“They're about in our league,”
he stated. “lt’s going to be a tough
meet, especially after tonight.”

Panthers Find WVU Heavenly

By BOB LABRIOLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

MORGANTOWN, W.Va.—John
Denver wrote it in a song several
years ago, but Wednesday night
was the ﬁrst time the Pitt Panthers
enjoyed the heavenly atmosphere
of West Virginia and the Mountain-
eers’ beautiful special-events cen-
ter, the West Virginia University
Coliseum.

Pitt’s 87-76 victory over West
Virginia, before a disappointingly
small crowd of 4,599, marked the
first time the Panthers have left the
Coliseum victorious, and the ﬁrst
time since 1954 that the city
slickers have swept the series from
the mountainmen.

The team that was embarrassed
at the Civic Arena by Duquesne
must not have made the trip south,
as the difference in the Panthers’
play was as well-deﬁned as the
broad grin on coach Tim Grgu-
rich’s face.

“They’re celebrating down there
(in the locker room),” Grgurich
said after the victory. ‘‘It’s just like
the Fourth of July.”

The return to normalcy didn’t
take place until the start of the
second half. Pitt remained a
sluggish team offensively in the
ﬁrst half, shooting only 35 percent
and turning the ball over 12 times
as the Mountaineers assumed a
37-31' lead at intermission.

« Terry Knight lit-a fire under» the
Panthers with 5 four lunanswered

.‘_,

baskets to open the ﬁnal 20
minutes, and Pitt was back in the
groove.

“Terry was the key to the second
half,” Panther guard Pete Strick-
land said. “He set the stage. When
Terry started penetrating, every-
one else on the team decided they
wanted a piece of the action, too.”

Pitt’s offense was as deadly as a
pit of cobras, striking quickly and
from anywhere on the court. Larry
Harris (10 of 18) Dave Olinger
(ﬁve of six) refined the Panthers’
outside shooting into an accurate
art, and Sam Clancy, Ed Scheuer-
mann and Knight ruled the area
around the basket. Pitt shot an
amazing 77.4 percent from the ﬂoor
in the second half.

The domination of the back-
boards, which the Panthers had
been able to maintain until
the Duquesne game, returned with
Pitt outrebounding West Virginia,
45-35. Clancy was the game’s
leading rebound collector (natural-
ly) with 14, Harris added 10 and
Scheuermann seven, as Pitt
matched its highest total of
victories (12) since .Grgurich
became coach in 1975.

“The guys really played some
basketball in the second half,”
Grgurich said. “The whole team
was down after Sunday's loss, and
it was tough coming to play down
here three days later. This win is a
credit to the ‘whole team.” ~ ~ A

The Panthers again found

‘L_~.L.- .-

themselves in foul trouble (Knight,
Scheuermann and Harris eventual-
ly fouled out), but the capable
performances of the reserves
negated the potential problem.
Olinger, Strickland and Wayne
Talbott each provided Pitt with
extended periods of quality play
causing the team to hardly miss a
beat in its victory march.

The most noticeable and vital
difference between the Panthers’
last two performances was the play
of Harris. After his Duquesne
sabbatical, the six foot-six inch
senior returned to the form Pitt
fans have grown to know and love,
leading all scorers with 27 points.
Shooting over the defense or
driving through it, Harris displayed
the type of offensive ability that has
pro scouts touting the all-America
candidate as an early second-round
choice in this year’s draft. Harris
may not be the only weapon in
Pitt’s arsenal, but he is undoubted-
ly the most deadly, and games
cannot be won if the big gun isn't
ﬁring properly.

A popular pastime among Pitt
followers has been to speculate
about where the Panthers are, as a
basketball team, after each exciting
victory or disappointing defeat.

“All I can say about the team is
that we're in West Virginia, we just
won a big basketball. game, and
we’re happy -as. heck,” Grgurich
said-" ,- - V  

No one argued with that.

Pantherettes Looking for Bid

By MARYS. HUZINEC
Pitt News Staff Writer

After nipping Slippery Rock State
College, 72-71, Tuesday night, the
Pantherette basketball team is
looking for victory over 11th-ranked
St. Joseph’s College tonight at
Fitzgerald Field House.

“This is a big game for us,” said
Coach Jean Balthaser. “We’re
presently in the process of getting a
bid for the Regional Tournament,
and an upset over one of the big
teams we’re playing in the next two
weeks would help us secure one.”

St. Joseph’s, coming off a win
over sixth-ranked Queen’s College
should be anticipating a good game
against 10-8 Pitt.

According to Balthaser, St.
Joseph's is an explosive team,
capable of scoring a lot of points in a
short period of time.

Mary Sue Garrity, a 5-5 guard, is
St. Joseph’s floor leader, and is
expected to give the Pantherette
defense some trouble.

“They’re a team that likes to
run,” Balthaser explained. “We’ll
have to concentrate on not letting
them set the tempo of the game.”

Balthaser said the Pantherettes
will have the height advantage
tonight and will try to work the ball
inside.

“We’ll have to break the press
and set it up,” she said.

On Tuesday against Slippery

Rock, Wanda Randolph, Barb
Welsh and Debbie Lewis scored in
double figures with 21, 19, and 15
points respectively, to lead Pitt to
victory. The Pantherette defense
was effective in holding off the
Slippery Rock attack in the first half,
but in the second half it was
penetrated and Randolph, Stephan-
ie Stripling, Welsh and Lewis all got
into foul trouble. The Pantherettes
overcame their sluggishness and
defeated the upstate rivals by one
tally.

Tomorrow, Pitt takes on Villa-
nova University at 5:45 in the
preliminary to the men’s contest.‘

“They’re a typical Philadelphia
team,” said Balthaser. “They’re

at the Lake Vue Arena this
weekend, with all procedes being

Winning Spirit Prevails

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writci
Like all athletes, Pitt long

distance swimmer Jeff Trew hates
to lose. Whenever he dives into the
pool for the Panthers’ undefeated
swim team, the freshman from
Shaler Township, unbeaten in both
the 500-and 1,000-yard freestyle
competition, knows it’s win or else.

“I really and truly can say I hate
to lose,” Trew said. “It has to be
the worst feeling in the world when
you do lose.”

DUFFERS MEET

Anyone interested in joining
the 1978 Pitt golf team should
attend today’s meeting in the
Field House at 4 p.m. Meet with
coach Steve Petro at Section A.

 

with Dayton before Navy meets the
9-7 Panthers. Sunday’s action will
include a consolation game at 11:30
a.m. and the championship match-
up between the two first-round
victors.

The tournament, renamed from
the Pitt Invitational, will keep the
same format, but with the
charitable gesture inserted. The
idea for the weekend event belongs
to Pitt assistant coach Bob
Montgomery, who develops the
entire Panther schedule. The

This win-or-else attitude has
taken Trew places in his swimming
career. Trew, who led Shaler
Township to the state champion-
ship last spring, is proud that he
has never competed on a losing
team.

It was a similar kind of urge to be
number one that helped the
flu-ridden freshman in Pitt’s
recent win over Maryland at Trees
Pool. Although he probably should
have been in bed instead of
swimming, Trew hung on in both
the 500-and-1,000-yard freestyle to
defeat Maryland’s top-ranked
swimmer, George Carpousas and
lead the Panthers to their ﬁfth win
of the season.

“I wasn’t breathing in the last
half of the ﬁnal event (500
freestyle),” Trew said. “But once I
got ahead, I wasn’t going to let

   

theme for the tournament, he said,
is that “it’s better to light one
candle than to curse the darkness.”

Each season hereafter, when the
tournament will be held at
Pittsburgh’s Civic Arena, the
trophy-winning team from the year
before will return to defend the top
honor.

The proceeds will be donated to a
different charity each year, with
next season’s receipts already
earmarked for the St. Anthony
School for Exceptional Children.

aggressive—offensively and de-
fensively. Since last year, they’ve
improved a lot, so it should be a
tough game.”

“The key to both games will be
for us to stay out of foul trouble and
to slow down their running games,”
she said.

If the Pantherettes pull out an
upset this weekend, they may find
themselves making arrangements
for some post-season play.

PANTHERETTE NOTES:

The flu epidemic hasn’t avoided
athletes. Several members of the
team, including Diane Zaken,
Welsh and Debbie Murray were
stricken.

RIFLE RESULTS

The Pitt riﬂe club finished
second in a field of four teams
last Friday, accumulating 1289

Jefferson (1181) finished third
and fourth.

Carpousas get in front of me. No
way. I had worked to get the lead
and I wasn’t going to let it slip
away from me.”

In the Panthers’ 68-39 win over
West Virginia Saturday, Trew, still
feeling the affects of the ﬂu, kept
his undefeated record intact as he
easily captured ﬁrst-place in both
the 500-and 1,000-yard freestyle, in
addition to a third-place finish in
the 200-yard freestyle.

With meets remaining against
Cleveland State, Clarion State and
Youngstown State, the rest of the
season will be only tuneup for
Trew, as he and the rest of the
Panthers gird for the Eastern
Regionals to be held early next
month at Trees Pool.

“The Easterns will be important
to me from both a team and
individual standpoint,” Trew

“I think I can do that in the
