Pitt Urban Studies Fate Sinking of Tower  Denied Willi

Nears Ultimate Decision

BY BILL HADUCK

The fate of Pitt’s urban studies
program, which was uncertain last
March after a number of its
requests regarding a wanted
improvement were denied, should
be decided within a few weeks
according to faculty members close
to the program. I A ~

‘(There have been some good
results,” said CAS Dean Robert
Marshall of efforts made to attain
some of the previously denied
requests from FAS Dean Jerome
“Things are going to
happen." —

Dean J eromei Rosenberg

Gubernatorial candidate-

Despite the Administration’s
claim of Pitt's relevancy as an
urban campus, the program had
been stiﬂed, according to its
teachers, through lack of facilities
and support. A senior faculty
member to direct the program,
office space, the appointment of a
full-time advisor, and increased

faculty time from various academic ,

departments_were requested of the
FAS council.

Rosenberg said yesterday much
of this will be attained.

“Though we're not quite ready
with the specifics,” Rosenberg

» said, “arrangements have been

made for administration and
budgetary appropriations.”
In addition, there will be seminar
courses both terms of senior year.
Urban studies instructors had
hoped for both junior and senior
seminars, but urban. studies

‘Director Walter S. Glazer said’,

compared to past years, the set up
was “fine with him.”

Glazer credited -University media
for some of the action taken. “Due

to the publicity in the Pitt News and '

the University Times about the
obvious inconsistencies in the
University’s public relations claims
and the actual truth about the
program, something is being
done." I '
The general optimism does not
appear to have overtaken all
parties, however.

Rumors Tower C will be
uninhabitable within four years
because of an unstable foundation
were labelled untrue and ridiculous
yesterday by University officials.

The rumors were reported to
have stemmed from observation of
cracks in the Tower C basement.

“I have no reason to believe that
it's in the least likely that Tower C
is sinking,” said Physical Plant

-Division Director Hunt Martin.

“The building has a solid founda-
tion. It is built on‘ a precast
concrete foundation." \
Maintenance Supervisor Jack
Miller agreed. “After 12 years
now, the building is pretty well
settled. The small cracks in the
concrete in the basement can result
from the building expanding and
contracting,” he explained. “If

Pocketbook issues--inﬂation and

‘taxes--will be the key ones in

November's gubernatorial election,
according to Republican candidate
Drew Lewis, in a press conference
Tuesday at the William Penn
Hotel.

“These are the things people are
talking most about," Lewis said.’
“The high cost of government is
going to be an extremely important
issue." -

Lewis, a former Montgomery
County businessman trying to

' unseat incumbent Milton Shapp,

criticized his opponent for failing to
create an atmosphere conducive to
business ‘expansion.

“The way to solve unemploy-
ment in Pennsylvania is not to
boost the state payroll, but to

i create a climate which would bring

business _and industry to I_’ennsyl-

agement trainees" offering exag-
gerated earnings for inexperienced
applicants. Students are asked to
attend training sessions, during
which they learn -thejob involves
selling magazine or book subscrip-
tions, pots and pans, cutlery sets,
or other products, and wages are
based on commission.

Although these are usually
legitimate companies, “employee
recruiting methods and salaries
quoted are often misleading,” said
Thomas W.‘ Rush of the Student
Employment Office.

Rush advised, ‘‘If the ad doesn’t
tell you what the company is selling"
and promises more than an
ordinary, weekly wage, I wouldn’t
answer it. If you do call and the
company representative cannot be
direct about the product, don’t go
to see him.”

Commission jobs are not posted
in the Student Employment Office
because, says Rush, “In any sales
job, you’ve got to let customers get
to know you. This can rarely be
accomplished in a four or ﬁve-
month period." ' , _

From December to April, many
coinpaniesprint up booklets which
they call “Summer Employment
Directories.” Posters and adver-

tisements instruct students to send .

ad coupons and one dollar in order

to receive pamphlets listing jobs

available at camps, summer resorts
or in Europe.

According to Rush, these book-
lets contain the same information
individual employers send to Pitt’s
employment office. They do not
guarantee the student a position

Martin. - ‘

Money Allocated.-f
To Organizations

By GENE GRABOWSKI

Budget allocations for Pitt stu-“Q
dent organizations were reviewed
last night by the Student Govern: '
ment Board (SGB). The special’ 1

meeting, held in Dining Room A of
the Student Union, dealt solely
with the allocation of funds -for‘

the programming, operation. and -

travel’ expenses of 16 student
organizations.’  -

SGB voted to provide program-‘if

graduate Women’s Union, $5.103;
the Pittsburgh International Stu; I
dents Organization (PISO). $295;
the B’nai B’rith Hillel Society, $1..‘

cans (CYR), $2,120; Engineering
NSO. $318; Engineering Stu.-

dent Cabinet, $3.625; the Public, _ _

Interest Research Group (PIRG).
$572. ' ‘

The Intercultural Communica-
tion Planning Committee of
YMCA was
ming funds because the organ-
ization is not operated by stu-

‘dents. The Board suggested the
group re-submit its budget under‘ .,

the auspices of a student organ-
ization at a future SGB meeting.

The Top Hat Club was voted no
funds for programming pending

the new group’s ‘success with its  -‘

present operating budget.

include this specific information,
according to Field Supervisor’ Mary
M. Maurath.

Neither the ‘Student Employment
office nor the ESO list organiza-

‘A misunderstanding by the
Board members over whether
SGB could accept parts of a bud-
get and reject others as Keller‘s
motion suggested. dissolved the
meeting for a few minutes into
scattered discussion on the val-
idity of SGB’s action. After con-
sultation. SGB President Mike
Furick ruled that'Keeler’s motion
would stand.

SGB also voted $2.041 for the In-
terfraternity Council operating
budget. and $3.685 for the com-
ined programming. operating
and travel costs of the Pitt Dance
Ensemble.

SGB voted not to fund the op-

Committee for re-investigation of

Board’s stipulation that the com-

is not to hire people on the state
payroll, but to create an atmos-

Pennsylvania."

Lewis proposed a budget sub-
mitted to the lawmakers on a
piecemeal basis which would speed

. legislative efficiency.

“I think we need in Pennsylvania

‘the type of open atmosphere in

state government we had when Bill
Scranton was governor," Lewis
said.

autonomy for municipalities, ex-
pressed sympathy for mass transit

needs, but washed his hands of the.

poor selection of merchandise.
“The state stores are worth
about $150 million in revenue. My
primary concern is not whether
Pennsylvania has the lowest liquor
prices in the country," he said.
“To take it today, we're better off

‘trying to correct the problems

within the present system.” '_

Lewis criticized Shapp for
refusing to accept his challenge to a
series of televised debates... “I’d
like to have them to discuss the
issues of education and highways,-
and I think lay our cards on the
table in terms of this corruption
issue.

“This is how people can see the
issues and see the candidates and
what they stand for." .

Admitting Watergate will have
some effect on him as a
Republican, Lewis found solace in
registration figures, that favor
Democrats in Pennsylvania by only
slightly more than 300,000 Voters.
‘‘I had been anticipating going into
this election with a 600,000 vote
deficit,” he said. . ,

“I do think there's a wave of
sentiment against politicians in
general," Lewis said. “I'm not as
concerned in terms of how
Watergate will affect me as much
as some of you people in the media
are, however. ’

“’l think-incumbents all over the
country will have a difficult time, as
opposed to just Republicans.

“The issue is people starting to
say, ‘Stop doing things for me. I
can't afford it anymore.’ I think
we’ve reached that point in
Pennsylvania."

 1,, Lewis Race for Gov_ Social Frustration Keyto-‘Sugarlandli

BY DREW PORVAZNIK

Two teenagers from Rancho
Cordova. California tried to steal
one million dollars by holding 24
bank patrons as hostages last
Saturday.

The two kids were not members
of any terrorist group nor were-they

- hard core criminals. Instead, they

were deeply distressed individuals
who felt society had ripped them
off. In a television interview that

"the teenagers demanded to plead

their case, the pair complained of
having no money, food or jobs.

Probably this daring robbery~

scheme was more a symbolic act
than a practical solution to their
problems. As stated in their

' interview, they wanted to call their

problems to the attention of society
via the kidnapping-robbery:
Bearing similar parallels is the

m'ovie,The Sugarland bxpress,‘

which is based on an actual event.
The film is about a young woman,
Lou Jean Popkin [Goldie Hawn]
and her accomplice husband,
Clovis [William Atherton] who
kidnap a Texas state trooper in a
desperate attempt to get back their
two year- old son from ‘his foster
parents. I

Like the two teenagers, Lou Jean
and Clovis are neither terrorists not
hard core criminals. Lou Jean feels
she is the victim of an unfeeling
society that has taken her child

away. As in the case of the Rancho
Cordova teenagers. Lou Jean
becomes so desperate tdsolve her
problem she is willing to carry out
this dangerous criminal act.

Lou Jean's attempt to recover
her son also is a more symbolic
than a realistic act. Surely she and
Clovis can't think they can succeed

,in forcefully taking the child from

the foster parents with about 50
police cars following them and their

kidnapped trooper (Michael Saks).

across Texas to Sugarland, a small
town where the child‘ lives.

The comical cascade of squad
cars following the three led by
Capt. Tanner [Ben Johnson]
serves, ironically, as a protective
escort rather than as a deterrent for
the two kidnappers.

In spite of this “comical cascade
of squad cars" there is still tension
felt. Sooner or later Tanner must
carry out the law rather than a good
will spirit and understanding of the
motives of the two which has made
Tanner use the‘ protective escort.

Goldie Hawn is very convincing
as a mother so emotionally involved

with recovering her son-that logic,
reason and common sense just

1 pi e#rI.....I.;‘yi;I .ilunel(li.,l1lt)74+THE_.PITT’NEWSgl??‘gﬁ§

  

don't exist for her.

Ben Johnson also plays a very
good role as a policeman more
concerned with the safety of people
involved than with a dangerous
capture of the law breakers

involved. Common in today’s films  

are law officers more bent on
vengeance than with people’s
safety.
and Walking Tall illustrate this
point. Johnson

Harry Callahan.

In the end. Lou'Jean has.-W’,

succeeded in bringing her problem

to the public’s attention and she T 7 ~

does deserve some sympathy, but
for carrying out the scheme, she
must pay the price.

The Sugarland Express is Di-

rector Steven Spielberg’s ﬁrst ﬁlm 

and it's quite a good start. He is a

director who has something intell- I

igent to say and says it in just the

right manner without offending or  

shocking viewers. ‘ 
The film has also won an award

for best screenplay at the Carmes__.

Trirmgles Broil Boston Lobsters

BY JOHN C. BLACKBURN

Even the blood-chilling glare of
Ion (the Terrible) Tiriac couldn't
stop the rampaging Pittsburgh
Triangles Tuesday night.

Pittsburgh so thoroughly de-
voured the Boston Lobsters that by
the time player-coach Tiriac took
the court in the fourth of five sets,
the average miracle would still
have left the Lobsters short. They
lost. 31-18.

Evonne Goolagong got the Tri’s
started with a tough 7-5 win over
fellow Australian Kerry Melville,

_and Ken Rosewall disposed of

Great Britain’s. Roger Taylor, 6-3.
Pittsburgh blew the match open
in the women's doubles, as

Goolagong and Peggy Michel

whipped Melville and Trish Bos-
trom, 6-1. At intermission, the
Triangles led 19-9, and needed to
win only three games in- the
remaining two sets to close Boston
out.

Two line judges disagreed on a

inexpensive. .

sudden-death tiebreaking point
which’ Tiriac’s partner Grover
“Razz” Reid had served in the
eighth men’s doubles game.
Tiriac’s action resulted in a
forfeited point that
Pittsburgh pair, then Vitas Gerul-
aitis and Gerald Battrick, a 6-2 set
victory.

The evening's most exciting set
was the opening wo'men's singles.
in which Goolagong, wearing
Melville down with her aggres-
siveness and wicked backhand,
recovered from a 3-1 deficit to win
7-5.

Calm Ken Rosewall won the first
seven points of his set against
Taylor. setting up a 4-1 service
break in the second game. He
continued carving Taylor up with
methodical precision (as beﬁts his
nickname, “The Surgeon"), built a
3-0 lead in games. and coasted to a
6-3 set victory.

_ Boston's women’s-doubles team
wilted under an impressive display

gave the '

of togetherness by Goolagong and
Michel. who were not even pressed
into sudden death while running up
a 4-0 lead in the set, and 17-8 in the
match. I

Pittsburgh opened the men's
doubles with Ken Rosewall and
Gerald Battrick, and wrapped up
his team victory by sweeping the
first three games. A brilliant alley
shot by Battrick broke Tiriac’s
service in the second game, and
when Reid's overzealous forehand
sailed over the baseline to end the
third. the Triangles had clinched
the match, leading 22-9.

It was a big win for the Tri's, who
lost a six-"game winning streak
Sunday in Cleveland. It was also
big enough to tie their record for
greatest winning margin set in the
sixth of those wins, a 27-14 romp in
Baltimore Saturday. The win left
the Triangles at 9-7, just one game
behind Detroit and Cleveland, who
are tied for first in WTT's Central
Section at 9-5.
