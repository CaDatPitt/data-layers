Skin
spray S
gun. used
at Pitt .

Tegan Hanlon
Senior Staﬂ” Writer

The latest technology inbum-victim
treatment looks like it belongs in a
society of robots and ﬂying cars ——
it’s a gun that sprays regenerated
skin cells onto damaged skin.

Dr.]i5rg Gerlach of Pitt’s McGow-
an Institute for Regenerative Medi-
cine developed askin—cell gun after
eight years of research. _ i

“As a surgeon, I was looking for
areas where I could apply my knowl-
edge in cell-based therapy develop-
ment,” he said.

The skin gun resembles an air;
brush gun, except the tube feeding
the gun does notattach to a con-
tainer of compressed air. Instead

’ it attaches to a large metal box —

part of an electronically processor-
controlled pneumatic device that
sets Gerlachfs skin gun apart from
others. .

“Skin—cell spraying is not new. It,
was invented around 20 years ago in
Argentina, and it is also performed
in Australia, but with a hand pump
atomizer similar to these window
cleaning sprayers,” he said.

But Gerlach said that, unlike the
hand pump, his electronic proces-
sor “does not injure the cells during .
spraying.”

To begin the skin spray process,
surgeons use a dermatome, a special

. knifethat cuts only a thin layer of the

donor area of the patient’s healthy
skin, Gerlach said.

Skin Spray 4 1

skin stem cells are isolated in an aqueous so-
lution for 90 minutes. The mixture is loaded
into syringes and inserted into the nozzle of
the gun. From the gun, the cells are sprayed
directly onto the wound.

Dr. Alain Corcos, trauma director at UPMC
Mercy, is part of Gerlach’s skin gun team. He
finds patients for Gerlach to treat and has used
the gun before. So far, four burn patients have
been treated at Mercy. He said he couldn’t
discuss the outcome of those cases.

When burn patients are treated with the
gun, it feels like they “are just getting saline

sprayed onto their arm,” he said.

“The gun is used to distribute it in a uni-
form way, at auniform velocity,” Corcos said.
“The liquid is clear, you can’t see skin cells with
the naked eye.” ‘ s -

Gerlach said the entire process takes two
hours, and recovery to close the wound takes
about aweek. .-

“It then takes several months for regenera-
tion of the color and skin texture,” he said.

Currently, the skin gun can only treat deep
dermal wounds, which are severe second-
degree burns. Gerlach said that he and his

team are working on addressing third-degree

vburns.

Deep dermal wounds burn through the
top layer of skin, the epidermis, and deep into
the second layer, the dermis. The burns result
in red-and-white bloody blisters. Burns that
extend all the way through the dermis are
classiﬁed as third-degree burns.

Corcos said that this speciﬁc burn type
leaves a “very small subset of patient.”

Most burns that are superﬁcial will heal

. on their own, and burns that are very deep
will need a traditional skin graft, Corcos said.

/.

Deep dérmal wounds lie between these two

- EXIICIIICS. -

Traditionally doctors would let this sub-
set of burns heal on its own, but Corcos said

' the healing process takes a long time, often

more than two weeks. The skin gun cuts the
healing time. *
Gerlach said using the skin gun treatment

results in less scarringthan allowing the bums C

to heal on their own.

Students stayed in safety

protests broke out, while the remaining student
left the country the next day.

Three of them chose to stay in Istanbul, Tur-
key, to participate in a different study abroad
program, while the other two returned to the
United States. Jeff Whitehead, director of the
StudyAbroad Ofﬁce, said inane-mail thatwhile
it was too late for the students to enroll at Pitt
this current semester, one of the two who came
back to the United States is working on a directed
study.

Administrators in the University Center
for International Studies, of which the SAO is a
component program, also provided the students
with additional assistance. The center identiﬁed
international programs that would still accept
students for the spring term and assisted them
through the enrollment process.

This was important work, as the transfers

required a lot of information to pass quickly be- ,

tween students, theAmericanUniversity of Cairo,
parents, University administration and other
study abroad providers, Whitehead said.

The SAO does not have its own “Pitt in Egypt”
program. Instead, it allows Pitt students to par-
ticipate in an Egypt program run out of Butler
University’s Institute For Study Abroad. Pitt
students can also participate in the American
University in Cairo program ‘

“We maintain avery strongworking relation-
ship with both providers,” Whitehead said.

‘ Pitt students interested in studying abroad
in Egypt in the fall should remain open to other
options because the University is not sure when
the changing political climate will allow it to safely
send students back to the country.

Whitehead said the University might allow
students to return there in the fall, or it could
choose to delay until the spring 2012 semester:

The conflict  the 
Pitt junior Gladys Arias was one of the ﬁve

~ students studying in Cairo when the protests

broke out. Arias said she was not worried at all
when she ﬁrst heard about the protests, as the
Egyptian students with whom she stayed told her
the protests would not amount to anything.

“I witnessed some of the protests but not
much. I was kept very safe in my dormitory,”
Arias said in an.e—mail. ,

The gravity of the protests, which eventually

forced out a government that had been in power _

for morethan30 years, did not really hit her until
the ﬁrst Friday following their start. On that day,
Arias satinthe dorm lobby and watched protest-
ers move on the street.

“Even thoughlwas so close, itfeltas if nothing
was really happening until then,” she said.

Arias thinks the protests were as peaceful as
possible, though she was upset about the loot-

he time to hesitate is
- over.’_
_ . In a staff editorial in

December, The Pitt News chose
to carefully weave through the
issues surrounding guns on cam-
pus, instead of coming down one
way or the other. Our article ad-
dressed a pro—gun resolution
passed that week by the Texas
State University student govern-
ment,'an institution we regarded
as hardly equipped to effect pol-
icy inﬂuence. That might have
been true. But it isn’t December
anymore. . ~

The Associated Press reported
that a majority of Texas House
representatives have co—signed
a bill to force public universities
in the state to allow concealed
carry of handguns. The bill,
which would not allow any pub-
licly funded institution of higher
education in Texas to “adopt any
rule, regulation or other provi-
sion prohibiting license holders
from carrying handguns on the
campus of the institution,” is
likely to pass both chambers of
the legislature. 

The bill must be stopped. Yes
— we said it. A .

As complicated as the con-
cealed-carry debate is, we think
the thought of this bill passing

in such a prominent state tolls '

ominously for American col-
lege students everywhere. Texas

boastsone of the fastest grow-

ing populations in the nation -
Census Bureau statistics, say the
state is 121 percent bigger than it
was 10 years ago. And since the
Bureau gave Texas four electoral
votes afterthe 2010 Census, this
country has yet to fully experi-
ence the cowboy state’s full in-
ﬂuence. Forget Californication;
enter Lone Star-nation.) A

A -so at The Pitt News, we’re not
just fearing for the 500,000 stu-

dents that attend Texan public C

universities, according to the As-
sociated Press. We’re fearing that
the dominos of ‘-‘conceal_ed” bul-
lets willfall on public campuses

fromthe Southwest to Pennsyl— .

Vania. ‘ -

People who learn together
shouldn’t also pack heat togeth-
er. A legislative measure to push
guns into the college atmosphere

' —— despite the wishes of admin-

istrators and police — should
be understood for the danger it
presents. ,

American college students are

finding enough trouble gradu-

ating as it is —- almost half who
enroll in four—year institutions

. fail to complete their degrees in

six years, according to a recent
Harvard study. Distracting stu-
dents further by equipping their
classmates with deadly force is
one more step in the wrong di-
rection (unless, of course, we
enjoy sealing the decline of the
educated U.S. workforce).

Even if we didn’t care about
keeping America educationally
competitive,’ we would at least
agree to keep our campuses safe,
right? Granted, the research on
the effects of concealed-carry on
crime is conclusion-less at best
and ripe for partisan manipu-
lation at worst — the National
Research Council said in a review
article that “the data available
on these questions are too weak
to support unambiguous con-
clusions or strong policy state-
ments.” Without reliable statistics
available, we still can’t fathom

how, in-the event of a violent al— _

tercation on campus, throwing
more firearms at the situation
would make anyone safer.

Look no further than the now-
infamous January shootings in
Tucson, Ariz., where a legally

-gun-c‘arrying« bystander, Joe

Zamudio, almost shotyanother
bystander who was wrestling

with the alleged shooter, Jared I

Lee Loughner. “I could have very
easily done the wrong thing and

hurt a lot more people,” Zamudio, .

who was quoted by several news
outlets, said. . »

of a deranged shooter is a terri-
fying thought, but we shou_ldn’t

Ever since folk herojohn Henry chal-

has clung to a tenuous advantage over
machine.Asyousawon lastweek’s epi-
sodes of “_]eopardy!,” this advantage is
no more. Ithasnowbeenscientiﬁcally
proven that machines are better at
spelling, math,  chess, lasers,
weightlifting, ‘rock-paper-scissors,
writingterm papers, running40—yard
dashes, sudoku and many other ac-
tivities once dominated by humans. In
light of such alarming developments,
we believethatitis necessary to reflect
on the ways in which humans remain

A superior to these robotic upstarts.

First, unless they break down, few

' machines can equal your average hu— _

man being —— let alone your average
college student—— interms oﬂaziness.
Unlike robots, whichwill keep doing
what they_’vebeen programmed to do

until their tasks are ﬁnished, humans '

display airemarkable propensity for

. avoiding-necessarywork.Whilethose

self—righteous machines toil cease-
lessly on one of the few Detroit auto
assembly lines still in operation, hu—
mans can postpone paying their bills

- in order to screen the pie-humping

comedy classic “American Pie” with
their friends. Computer alarms go off
exactly as scheduled, but humans can
miss their 6 p.m. classes to shake off
brutal hangovers, sleep through im-
portant appointments like their own

' graduations and waste entire weeks

cultivating their “Farmville” estates.
In addition to this innate talent for
procrastination, humans continue to
display levels of acquisitiveness far
in excess of any machine. Sure, the
trivia robot Watson won thousands of

dollars on a quiz show by rattling off 4

facts like the population of Novgorod
(216,200 people) and the Academy
Awards’ choice ofBest Picture for 1964
(“My Fair Lady”) — but could it have
invented the collateralized mortgage
obligations that nearly destroyed
the world economic system? Robots
might be brimming with knowledge,
but they lack the cleverness to de-
fraud investors of billions of dollars
or award themselves fat bonuses fol-

lowing disastrous ﬁscal years. Even i

when ordered to maximize gains,
these soulless, socialistic machines
carmot compete with selﬁsh Rand-
ian supermen likejohn Galt. Until we
ﬁnd away to program them with suf-
ﬁcient artiﬁcial intelligence to make
them realize the value of gold hordes,
trillion—dollar oﬁshorebank accounts
and Scrooge 1yIcDuck-style “money
bins,” these machines will never cut,
the mustard on Wall Street.

Machines are also unable to de- '

velop the obsessive association with
hometown sports teams and athletic
idols that many humans possess.
Whether you’re partial to Stephen
“Starbury” Marbury’s gravity-defy-
ing slams or our Pittsburgh Pirates’
record losing streak, you can rest
assured that no metal-brained robot
could ever hope to equal your level
of fandom. Humans are able to take
it personal and make it personal in a
‘way-that the machines cannot match,
bound as they are by rigid rules like
their prime directive not to kill their
masters. _ T V ' a

Cement buckets, trash lids and aﬁre
extinguisher are just some of the
stage props for the plays featured
in the “Trespass,” series at Future
Tenant’s art space.

Every year three performance

‘ artists are given the opportunity to

take a week in the space to put on a
production. This year’s production
features an eclectic group of plays
with topics ranging from everyday

‘ trash to conﬂict in Yugoslavia. The

gallery has put on the “Trespass”
series for three years.

Erin Gough, facilities manager
for Future Tenant, said the shows
for the “Trespass” series are de-

cided through an application and
audition process. She said that this
year there were nearly 30 applicants,
the most applications Future Tenant
has ever received. The applications
came from local theater companies
as well as individuals hoping to be
featured. Gough said that original-
ity as well as performance skill were

— what ultimately decided the three

chosen plays. - . ,
The pieces in this years series are:

In the Basement Theatre Company’s

“Within Distance,” No Name Play-

" ers’ “The Archipelago” and Poof ’s

uStuﬁ'.” .

“Within Distance” debuted this
past weekend. In the Basement
Theatre Company consists of Carn-
egie Mellon students Alex Weston,
Adrian Enscoe,Jessie Shelton, Katya
Stepanov, Jesse Carey-Beaver, Asia
Gagnon and Sarah Gillam. 1

Their play is a retelling of cre-
ation stories from across cultural
boundaries. The characters, XX and

XY, representing woman and man ‘

respectively, encounter several'ele—
ments of life that act as dividers.

“The characters are named XX
and XY so as to remove any religious
connotation. We wanted to personify
the forces that have separated us as
people,” Weston said. ’

The play features a set construct-
ed almost completely out of house-
hold items: buckets, trash lids and a
ﬁre extinguisher make up the drum
set on stage. -

“We basically went to the hard-
ware store and banged on things
until we found what sounded good,”
Weston said.

Enscoe, one of the actors, said the
group chose to go with a makeshift
set to show beauty in simplicity.

“We wanted to say, ‘This is us’
—- to bring about a sort of child-
like imagination in our work,” En-
scoe said, explaining that the group
wanted to make it seem as though

» the set might have been created by

children. ,

The next show in the series, which
will be presented today through Fri-
day at 8 p.m., is “The Archipelago: A

Justin Andrew, a local‘ singer-

doesn’t like to conﬁne himself to

Andrew began his musical ca-

32-year-old has immersed himself _

in as many different facets of the
musical world as possible —— from
playing an assortment of instru-
ments in various local bands to

working in the more ‘technical
ﬁelds of the industry. He has
played professionally for 10 years
and officially been in The Justin
Andrew Band for three years.
Andrew believes these experi-
ences have helped him develop a

three-dimensional understanding ..

of his art.

“Being a sound engineer in
general, especially a live sound
engineer, gives you a little bit of an
advantage as far as knowing how
to behave when you arrive at a club
and knowing how to be a profes-
sional when you’re on stage,” An-

know ‘Oh, you shouldn’t' do that.”’

Recorded in 1997 with the production as-

Celtic—tinged albums the group has produced
as of late, but they do resonate with the expe-

Play surrounds audience with trash

tion book by Pitt alumnus and author Rob-
ert Isenberg. Isenberg performs in the one-
man play, telling the story of his year—long
trip through the former Yugoslavia to visit
an old high school friend. It relates stories
from Greece, Albania, Montenegro, Croatia
and Bosnia.

The piece is a recounting of stories fea-
tured in Isenberg’s book of the same title. His
one-man show is presented by Pittsburgh’s
performance group The No Name Players in
conjunction with the_ publishers of the book,
Autumn House Press.

Isenberg said that there are plenty of
similarities between his one-man approach
and that of Michael Phillip Edwards’ in the

award-winning ‘.‘rimt,”- a-show about a-man’s .

relationship with his father, which was recently
featured at PitIsburgh’s Cultural Trust. Isenberg
said that Edwar ’ introspective look into his
childhood and himself is a good example of
what he wanted to accomplish in his piece.

Isenberg said his work is inspired by the,

playwright Spalding Gray, whose one-man
monologues garnered him fame. . .

“A lot is still happening [in Yugoslavia], the
media doesn-’t really cover that region as much
anymore,” Isenberg said. . A '

The ﬁnal work in the series is Poof’s “Stuff,”
to be shown March 4-5 at 9 p.m.

A series of short documentary ﬁlms by An-

nie Leonard on the website storyofstuffcom
inspired the Pittsburgh performance artist
group Poof ’s production. In the shorts, Leon-
ard tracked how much trash and waste is cre-
ated in everyday life.  I "

“Stuff” features a set comprised entirely

at the same time not spew facts at the audi-
ence. '

“When people hear facts, they tend to not
incorporate them in their lives; Art has that
power to actually impact,” Strauss said.

“Stuff” alsohopes to pull the audience in by

Justin Andrew ( 7

H alienate their audiences or upset the door

person or promoter.

Drawing inspiration from the music of
the ’70s —' speciﬁcally Crosby, Stills,_Nash
& Young, Cat Stevens and Paul Simon —
Andrew prefers his sound to have a simple
“airy” or “honest” quality, deﬁned by a
rougher texture and absence of extensive
production.

Sean Soisson, a drummer in Andrew’s
eponymous band, said the sing-songwrit-
er’s attention to detail and ability.to artfully
compose songs set him apart from similar
musicians.‘ ‘

“He puts a lot of time and care into the
way that he writes songs, and I think that
has everything to do with why‘ his songs turn
out so well. It seems to me like he doesn’t
really skimp on any of the elements of the
song,” Soisson said.

Courtney Brooke Hall, one of Andrew’s
oldest friends, said music allows the'singer-
songwriter a peculiar means of communi-
cation.

“His lyrics come from this place in him
that, if he didn’t have music to say it through,
I don’t think they’re words that would ever
cross his lips. I mean, the man wrote a song

about his dog, and the ﬁrst time I heard it,
I cried,” Hall said.

Andrew said music’s' ability to pro-
voke an emotional response through song;
encourages and interests him enough to
continue his career in music and keep him
driven from day to day. ' h

“I think it’s really neat that you can have
one interpretation of your song and some-
body else can have another one. It’s nice to
be able to share something that I’m feeling
and have someone else relate to it in a to-
tally different way, orthe same way, even,”
Andrew said. A .

There seems to be a niche in the Pitts-
burgh musical scene for performers like

Andrew. Both Soisson and Andrew agree;

thatthe local music scene is heading in a
direction more geared to a folksy, classical
rock atmosphere, and Andrew is perfectly,
happy to ﬁll the niche.

“I think that what’s. going on in Pitts-
burgh is a realsupportive scene for the
kind of music that I’m doing,” he said. “It’s
nice that there’s a scene for what I’m doing
now, and it seems to have come about at
the same time I decided to startforming
this band.” I

For The Pitt News

Senior leadership and freshman
contributions are the name of the
game for this year’s Pitt women’s
tennis squad.

But the team is under some
new leadership this season with
assistant coach and all-time Pitt
wins leader Kristy Borza joining
the staff.

Borza will aid head coach
George Dieffenbach in helping
the team win. Ironically, she might
help two current players, including
her younger sister Kimmy, come

_ close to eclipsing her record.

Throughout the initial seven
matches of the season, senior
Elizabeth Adams rose in the re-
cord books as one of the school’s
premierall-time players.

Beginning the year with 122
victories in her ﬁrst three seasons
(combined singles and doubles),

Adams needed 14 wins to move
past former player Carlie Smith’s
135 career wins and into second
place all-time.

To date, Adams has accumu-
lated nine wi_ns, giving her 131 to-

1 tal and landing her in third place

among all women to play Pitt wom-
en’s tennis. Five more victories in
the team’s 13 remaining regular
season matches on the hard court
would land her in second.

Coach Bor_za accumulated 91'

singles wins along with 85 in dou-
bles play from 2005-2009. With
176 wins, her Pitt record will serve
as a benchmark for current play-
ers.

But her younger sister, a fresh-
man this season, isn’t shying away
from the challenge.

Kimmy has already established
herself as a contributor to the
team, playinga prominent role in
just her ﬁrst year. She already has
seven wins on the season, four in
singles and three in doubles play.

“My older sister.Nikki was
coach before Kristy, and I didn’t

know Kristy was going to be

named coach this year,” Kimmy

Borza said. “But I am extremely-

close with both of my sisters, and
they both know a lot about tennis,
so it did help me choose to come
to Pitt.”

With Adams leading the way
and four freshman players already
doing their part, the team hopes to
gain consistency going forward. *

Last Wednesday, the Panthers
played rival WVU, losing by a count
of 5-2. Adams and sophomore Ga-
brielle Catanzariti won their No. 1
doubles matchup, but the Moun-
taineers won the other.

In singles play, sophomore Kar-
ma Parbhu and Borza notched wins
for Pitt, but WVU took the rest of
singles play to gain the victory and
drop the Panthers to 2-4.

“The loss to WVU was tough
—— we had a lot of close matches

GREGORIAN RANTS

College basketball polls insigniﬁcant   .

Greg Trietley
Senior Staﬁ" Writer

 

We follow college basketball’s Top 25 polls
religiously. We argue over them. We view
them as a reflection of not just how good or
bad our favorite teams are, but also of what
others think about them.

I But someone once told me that the polls
don’t matter, and that person was correct. No
members of the NCAA Tournament Selection
Committee participate in the weekly routine.
Instead, the committee‘, weighs each‘.team’s
strength ‘offschedule and RPI  Ratings’

‘ Percentage Index '—- to determine its March

Madness ﬁeld. , 7    rr ff .

 W The disparity between the polls and tour-
nament seeds_ is surpr'?ising',atVtimes. Last
season, UTEP ﬁnished No. 25 yet received a
No. 12 seed. Unranked Notre Dame earned
a No. 6 seed. I ‘ . -

V Coaches’ don’t pay the polls much atten-
tion either. A reporter asked Pitt head coach
Jamie Dixon at a press conference Monday

about updated polls that placed his team .

No. 4.

/nu./(::' IN a ,_-.,w/1//2

“I haven’t even looked at it,” Dixon said. “I
don’t spend'much time looking at that.”

' In the past, Dixon haspointed to the RPI
to gauge teams. The index measures each
team’s winning percentage, its opponents’
winning percentages, and its opponents’
opponents’ winning percentages with a
weighted formula. As _of Monday, Kansas
was ﬁrst._Pitt was ninth. .

If for no other reason, the.RPI trounces

said Pitt lost to No. 14 Notre Dame, but the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported it lost to
No. 15 Notre Dame.

The difference between No. 14 and No-

15 might be splitting hairs, but when Pitt
defeated Texas in November, the Coaches
Poll had the Longhorns No. 22 and the AP
Poll had them unranked. Before December’s
game against No. 11/13 Tennessee, some
sources wrote that the Panthers had yet to

But someone onee told me that

the polls because the polls can’t agree with
each other. Analysts vacillate between two
separate Top 25 rankings: the AP Poll and the
ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll. ESPN uses
the Coaches Poll because, well, the network
co-sponsors it. Most other publications use
the AP Poll, though — which is why ESPN

play a ranked opponent, while others spoke
of their tough schedule. I

, Every Monday, the AP Poll tallies the bal-
lots of 64 broadcasters and sportswriters
for its Top 25. It awards a team 25 points
for each ﬁrst-place vote, 24 points for each
second-place vote and so on, all the way

(12:52) as: 9 1..

down to one earned point for a single 25th-

, place vote.

Belmont, UCLA and Harvard were this
week’s one-pointers.

Currently Duke is No. 1 and Ohio State’?-‘
is No. 2, but the Blue Devils received just 12
more points than the Buckeyes. They might
as well be No. 1a and No. 1b. ’

Sixty—one of the AP Poll’s 64 voters are
regional sports reporters. The only three
national media personalities involved this
season are Seth Davis of Sports Illustrated,
John Feinstein of NPR and Dick Vitale of
ESPN. Whether it’s a good or bad thing, just
about every television personality doesn’t
contribute —— even ones that you assumed
did.

The AP makes its ballots public. The In’-"5
ternet can tell you where Pittsburgh Tribune-
Review writer Dave Mackall ranked Pitt (No.

.3) or where Vitale ranked Duke (No. 1).

Texas’ lone ﬁrst-place vote this week came
fromjeffrey Martin of the, ahem, Houston
Chronicle, but regional pessimism rings tru-
er on the ballots. John Werner of the Waco
Tribune-Herald had Texas No. 5. Neither
Ohio writer placed Ohio State No. 1.

their chosen sport, we value their commit-
ment to education more.” 1 p .  .
Various members of Pitt’sVAthl‘etic De-
partment announced the team awards, with
Assistant Athletic Director for Student Life

' Penny Semaia serving as the Master of Cer-

emonies.

The softball team won the Most Im-
proved Team award, earning a cumulative
2.92 GPA — last year’s team GPA'was not
announced. 1

The tennis team won the Overall Team
Award, earning a 3.32. The award was the
ﬁrst such distinction for the women’s ten-

nis team. _

“The main reason we are at the Uni—
versity of Pittsburgh is education,” tennis
head coach George Dieffenbach said. “Our
athletes are students ﬁrst. Long after their
athletic careers are completed, their aca-
demic success will have lasting results upon
their lives.”

The men’s soccer team won the Top Men’s
Academic Award _— its second in a row —
with a 2.89 GPA.

A minimum 1.7 GPA is needed to compete

‘in NCAA athletics for freshmen, with that

number increasing by .1 every year. I

. Lady Panthers swept the Bonnies,7—0 to raise

their record to 3-4 this season.

“It felt really good to bounce back against
St. Bonaventure and get some conﬁdence
when we play Nova Southeastern in March,
a team we lost to last year,”. Borza‘ said.

But Borza is only one of four freshmen

because I wanted to experience something

new, and'it’s been a fun year.”

.With Borza, Lu, and others established,
Dieffenbach has a core that will develop and
hopefully produce a few players who will
take their own places in the record books
down the line.

“Our freshman class has been contribut- 3

ing a lot this year, and we are going to be
really strong for Pitt tennis the next four
years,” Lu said. .

Top, 25 doesn’t i mean much

Trietley 4 11

The Coaches. Poll, on the other hand, tra-
ditionally doesn’t make its ballots public.
Thirty—one Division I coaches vote in it. Most
are from so-called “mid—major” schools,

although the notable exceptions in this sea-.

son’s group are Jim Boeheim [Syracuse],

Scott Drew [Baylor], Matt Painter [Purdue]

and Gary Williams [Maryland].
This week, 11 teams have a different rank

across polls. Fans often‘ refer to the higher
one, but then it becomes a Top 30 or so and
not a Top 25. .

You’re supposed to squabble over Duke at
No. 1, Pitt at No. 4/6 or Texas at No. 5. That’s
the point. Just remember: Come March, no-

body remembers who ﬁnished No. 1 in the ‘

polls. People remember who ﬁnished No. 1
