In an attempt to get some direct feed-
back from students on the relation of the
State government to state-related univer-
sities in Pennsylvania, Governor Raymond
P. Shafer has decided to make an all-day
visit to the University next Wednesday.

Governor Shafer’s scheduled trip here
is one in a series of visits that he is mak-
ing to all state-related universities in or-
der to “establish better relations with the

were to Penn State and Waynesburg.

In accordance with the emphasis on
students, the state executive will meet and
-interact only with students and faculty.
He is not scheduling sessions with either
Chancellor Posvar or any other members
of the administration.

The Governor’s itinerary has been set
up as follows:

12-1 p.m.—Lunch in Schenley Cafeteria
with students.

1:30-3:45 p.m.-Question and answer per-

At Greek Week’s Thursday night din-
ner, Children’s Hospital received a~-check
V for $2,730 from the Greek Week service
project “Transplant for Tots.” The dona-
tion will go towards a machine for filter-
ing bloodduring liver transplants. All the
money was collected on campus during
the week.

Tuesday, 155 pints of blood were col-
lected from students for the Central Blood
Bank of Pittsburgh. '

Robin Benson was crowned Greek
Week Queen at the Greek Sing Wednes-
day night. At the Sing, Sigma Chi took
top honors in the fraternity division and

among the sororities.

The Fifth Dimension performed to a
near-capacity-— crowd at the Syria Mosque
Friday evening. During intermission, the
Chancellor’s Cup for best fraternity was
awarded to Phi Kappa Theta, and Chuck
Green, past IFC president, won the Mr.
Fraternity Award.

visit, George M. Lies, contributing editor’,
of The Pitt News, believes that in part
“he’s looking out for the future of they

A SG senator shared this point of view

  hanging
by DAVE TIERNAN
Editor, Pitt News

In this space of Wednesday’s Pitt News,
I offered an optimistic analysis of cur-
rent administrative changes.

Wednesday's analysis was that pos-
sibly the Chancellor had taken steps to
insure students and faculty the most recep-
tive men possible to fill the positions of
deans in Arts and Sciences, or that these
deans “saw the writing on the wall and de-

I-‘

it cided to step down and allow new men

the opportunity to work with students and
faculty in updating academic policy.

Both Dean Kehl and Dean Halliday
responded to the article by saying that

they had resigned for the personal reasons .

which were stated in the University’s news
releases, and that there had been no pres-

sure from the Chancellor to do so.
Although the Deans indicate that there V

was no direct pressure from the Chancellor,

l a look at some of the other pressures they
; faced might well explain why they have re-

signed from their vulnerable positions for
“personal reasons.” Also, this insight is

 necessary to gain an understanding of the

problems the University community will
face in the future.

These men received demands from
Blacks during the past year. They re-
ceived demands from concerned students
and faculty. They received proposals from
Student Government, the Liberal Arts Cab-
inet, The Pitt News, and many other stu-
dent groups. One proposal they received,
however, might shed" some light on the
subject of their pressures more than all the
rest.

This proposal was from certain mem-
bersof the University community for a de-
partment of Religious Studies. In an article
in The New York Times two weeks-ago,
Father William Clancy, provost of the
Pittsburgh Oratory commented on the lack
of a department of theology or compara-
tive religion at the University.

‘ Fr. Clancy noted that “the University
of Pittsburgh is a paradigm of curious an-
omalies. From its beginning the school was

_ private and nonsectarian; and it has been

deeplyinfluenced by the Pittsburgh Pro-
testant aristocracy who were its major
backers. In 1967, however, the University
and while other
state-related universities in Pennsylvania
— most notably Temple and Penn State -
have, in the past few years, developed full,
distinguished and ecumenical departments
of comparative religion and theology, the

. University of Pittsburgh has not.”

_ Fr. Clancy went on to say that “the
only course open to undergraduates that
deals seriously with contemporary issues
appears, as it were in disguise: this is the.
course in Existentialism taught by the Jew-
ish theologian Richard Rubenstein. It is
offered in the French department —- and it is
one of the most consistently over-enrolled
electives in the entire undergraduate cur-
riculum.”

Rabbi Rubenstein informed me that
the proposal for a department of Reli-
gious Thought was made in the fall of
1968, and that no action had been taken.
Rabbi Rubenstein noted that no explanation
had been made by the Administration as to
why or why not the department was fea-
sible.

One possible answer is that they were
too busy responding to the pressure being
applied for immediate action in the area
of Black Studies to respond to the pro-'‘
posals of the University chaplains. Surely
they were aware of the fact that the chap-
lains would not sit in the Computer Center
of the Common Facilities building until
their demands were met. But at the same
time, they must have been aware of the
need for a department of Religion. They
must have felt a moral obligation to the ma-
jority of students who deserve courses in
religious thought that are lacking here.
But they took no action.

An individual can only do so.much,
and evidently the types of problems that
Dean Kehl and Dean Halliday faced with
the proposed department of Relgion were
similiar to many others they faced; It must
have been this type of pressure that caus-
ed them to. resign, not the pressure of
Chancellor Posvar.

by JOHN IIEYDAR .

_The war goes on. The killing continues. The only community before

us IS a community of killers. Our “brotherhood” is nothing more than a cruel

~ bond in blood. . . . . And yet, all too many seem to feel that the war is over,

that it was fought over and lost a year or two years ago.

President‘ has received, by default, the title of “peace-maker. But have we
all forgotten? We are the peacemakers — each one of us. 4

“We used to wonder where war lived, what it was that made it so vile.
And now we realize that we know where it lives, that it is inside ‘ourselves.
For most people, it’s the embarassment, the need to make a choice, the.
choice which makes them go but feel remorse for not having been brave
enough to stay at home,,or which makes them stay at home but regret that
they can't share the way the others are going to die.

‘?It’s there, that's where it really is, and we are looking for it in the blue
sky and the world's indifference. It is in this terrible loneliness both of the
combatants and the noncombatants,’ in this humiliated despair that we all
feel, in the baseness that we feel growing in our faces as the days go by.”

Let us resist that despair . . . On Monday night, March 31, I and per-
haps others, will return draft cards to Selective Service,. and by doing so,
say “no” to that ‘war, the war that has driven us, all of us, apart from one
another. Join us in our hope for a community, in our hope for a comiiigtlo-l

Picture a little boy about four years old
climbing a tree in the front yard of his home.

It’s a crooked tree bent over and wrin-
kled like an old man. The boy is hugging
the lowest branch of the tree with his
arms, legs, and belly. The branch is hard-
ly more than six feet above ground.

But it’s so scary up here! And besides
it’s" so exciting and it’s such a beautiful
day out today . . . look at all the green
leaves all over the tree and oh look up

there, there’s the sky and there’s heaven"

and there’s where God lives up behind that
cloud and . . . down on the sidewalk . . .
who's that standing there? Oh! It’s the
balloon man!

Wow! And look at all the colors (red
and blue and green and yellow and blue and
orange . . .)

“How are you sonny?”
‘-‘Hi Mister. Can I have one? Can I?”

The boy shinnies down the tree. His
pretty young mother steps out onto the
porch. “What color would you like?” she
asks but the boy can’t make up his mind.

Now the yellow balloon is .lying on the
lawn and_ the boy is digging in the bushes a
few feet away..He is kneeling and the cool
of the earth rushing through his knees
chills his little body.

“Qiliet hours”in girls’ dorms are vir-

tually non-existent. Theoretically these,

hours extend from seven pm. to 10 p.m.
and 11 p.m. toseven a.m.

These hours should not have to be en-
forced. Dorm living implies certain indi-
vidual obligations and a great deal of com-
mon courtesy, especially where large num-
bers of girls must live in close proximity.

According to "the student handbook,
“The University requires that there be
established sufficient regulations in both
residence halls and fraternity houses to
provide for safety and to protect the rights
of all for adequate rest and privacy, good
study conditions, and harmonious, con-
structive human relations.”

A major complaint of many girls from
Holland Hall, Tower C, and Brackenridge,
including myself, is the gross inconsider-
ateness and intolerance of those inevit-
able inhabitants of every floor who never

feel rules apply to them. They evidently _

do not realize or care that there are ac-
tually girls on the floor (believe itaor not)
who would at least’ occasionally like to
sleep or study at normal hours without
having to contend with a continuous up-
roar of blaring radios, laughing, shriek-
ing, yelling, loud phone conversations,
overpowering virtuoso song renditions
from the showers, and slamming doors at
all hours of the day and night. To observe
this amazing phenomenon, you need only
to step "off the elevators at practically
any floor at any time.

The rules of the noisemakers seem to
be: 1) shriek, don’t laugh or talk nor-
mally._This way, your voice will go right
through the walls and penetrate the entire
floor. 2) Play the radio or record player
as loud as the volume will go. This will not
only hasten deafness, but it will also an-
tagonize anyone foolish enough to be try-
ing to study.

I firmly believe in the right of everyone
to freedom of speech _and the pursuit of
happiness. But I do not recognize the right
of anyone or any group to disrupt or en-
croach upon the freedom of any other in-
dividual on the floor. We're all paying the
same room and board, but we’re not all
getting the same privileges. The plot thick-

Oh. How ’bout tomorrow? Okay!” She’s
such a nice lady she always likes to see
my toys. But, I only ever see her walkin’
up and down the sidewalk wearin’ her hat
and carryin’ her purse. Doesn’t she ever
stop walkin’?

And after the nap daddy comes home
and the little boy jumps on his back and
pulls his hair. And now it’s Howdy Doody
time. There are the two older brothers
seated in front of the TV. The little boy
sits down to watch, also. After dinner he
will watch Captain Video, Fort Pitt News,
The Lone Ranger, and Hopalong Cassidy
before going to bed.

of studying and concentration. Light sleep-
ers must resign themselves to a doom
of perpetual insomnia.

As a personal example and a case in
point, I have not been able to use my dorm
room this entire school year for much be-

‘ yond a storage bin for clothes and books.

I have been able to do very little uninter-
rupted studying or reading, and I usual-
ly find it impossible to get much sleep.
These aren’t isolated incidences; this is
every day and night. It’s hard to believe
that so many people just don’t consider
others on the floor and exist in a totally
oblivious euphoria of noise. After awhile
this gets oppressive. After two solid terms,
it isinsane. .
The saddest part of this whole mess is
that it’s all so unnecessary. There is sim-
ply no excuse for such continual gross in-
considerateness and intolerance that does
not let up on many floors even during mid-
terms and finals. There are several solu-
tions: 1) Study in the library. This is not
always satisfactory, especially because
the library closes at 11:30 and floor noise
usually doesn’t subside until around 4 a.m.
This also doesn’t answer the problem of
trying to sleep through the din. Besides,
why should anyone be literally driven out
of a room that is supposedly for her occu-
pancy? Dorm life should be a happy ex-
perience, but when it is making anyone
miserable, it is not fulfilling its function.

I am aware that some noise is to be ex-

pected as matter of course when many:

people live together. I am not proposing
that floors resemble the mummy exhibit
at Carnegie Museum. What I am saying is
that when a student must faceva continu-
ous three-ring circus, peaceful co-exis-
tence on the floor becomes impossible.

The only tenable solution that I can see
is to try to get every dorm resident to

realize the widespread effects of her ac-‘

tions. The problem of excessive noise
would not exist if we all tried to relate to
each other as human beings and as individ-
ual personalities. Otherwise, complaints
will continue to fall on deaf ears (liter-
ally) andantagonism will exist that does
not have to exist. And I wouldn’t have to
be sitting here writing this column at 3:30
a.m. with record album afterrecord album
and two different radio stations blaring in
my ears. Thank heaven for small miracles
— it’s almost the end of the term.

‘Pitt News’ Feature

Negro Changed View At Pitt

by DON MARBURY
Staff Feature Editor

Four years ago a somewhat
idealistic young black man
came to the University of Pitts-
burgh with the idea that he had
somehow made it into some
kind of heaven. Pitt then seem-
ed to him like the ideal learn-
ing place. This young man
was just spell bound at the
idea that he was an under-
graduate_ at the great nothern
University _of Pittsburgh. The
thoughts of its eighteen story dor-
mitories, air conditioning in ev-
ery room, and all the food. you
could eat, made him think that
white society and the University
had to be the greatest things on
earth.

In April,, Washington D.C.
born, Joe McCormick, chair-
man of BAS will be graduating
from the University, and he is
definitely not the same awed
young man who came here in
1965.

McCormick reflected on the
type of person he was before
the University forced him to
start soul searching, and change
from a liberal young Negro
man, to the reasoning, race con-
scious, black man he is today.
“When I first came to this
place,” he said, .“I was a firm
believer in integration. I
didn’t even want to pledge a
black fraternity. I refrained
from using the words Black or
racisim,” he went on.

McCormick said that after
undergoing many experiences
with the very subtle form of ra-
cism employed in the University,

that he was soon ready to leave I ‘

his deal University of Pittsburgh.
He said that he started wonder-
ing why there were only about
one hundred black undergradu-
ates. at the University. “In my
freshman year,” he went on,
“I took a course in my major,
(political science) entitled World
Politics. Through the course I
started noticing too many incon-
sistencies in this great country
of ours. So,” he continued, “I

‘LeRoy’, ‘GI’
Loosen Up
For WPGH

That better-than-the—average
roundball five, those incredible
Pitt News Hawks will be prac-
ticing in the Trees Hall Gymna-
sium this afternoon. Coach Roy,
“Jumpshot” Jacobs is getting his
crew ready for another victory
over WPGH’s Owls.

The annual battle will take
place at the Field House Tues-
day night. The Owls have yet to
defeat the Hawks, losing last year
by one point, and forfeiting every
game annually before that.

This year’s Hawks will once
again be led by Jerry “LeRoy”
Gruebel, “Jumpshot,” and Art
“Bubba” Rosengarten.

“We’ll be much better this
year,” shouted “LeRoy,” facing
the wall. “Dave ‘GI’ Tiernan is
going to play for us. He’s not that
good, but he passes a lot. That
means I can shoot more and I
love to miss?”

“LeRoy” won’t be as groggy
Tuesday. “I’ll be up for the
game,” he insisted. “Just remind
me.” ~»

Popes Hopes For Surprise Netters

by BILL NAAB

It’s a little late and coach Ben Pope is worried because he
is still without a settled tennis team.

The first match of the season is Tuesday against the West
Virginia Mountaineers. WVU may already have their lineup
set and ready to go, but Pope still can not name more than two
starters. Pope can rely on number one man, Tom Stromp, and

can only hope that footballer J.
D. Lewis decides to help the per-
plexed netters.

Presently, it seems as though
Pope is more concerned with the
matches that his tennis team is
scheduled to play after the win-
ter trimester. Even when the sub-
ject is the soon-to-be sophomores,
however, Pope only mentions one
name—Dick Wright.

Pope was hoping to hold elim-
ination matches this week to de-
termine who will earn the open
starting berths, but bad weather
may have crushed those expecta-
tions. It will, however, be the
players Pope has yet to evaluate
who will eventually decide if the
season will be profitable or disas-
trous.

“There’s really no purpose in
discussing the boys who haven’t
yet played or even earned a spot
on the team,” said Pope earlier,

   

hoping for some surprise bright
spots.

If by chance one or two of the
crew of fill-ins should prove them-

selves capable performers the ten-
nis season won’t be as long as it
looks like it is going to be now.
As for the first match against
WVU, Pope said, “They almost
always have a good team. I guess
it’s been seven years since we’ve
beaten them.” -
