Pitt wins '88 blood drive
challenge over Penn State

By Adam W. Richter
Staff Writer

For the first time since 1983,
the University of Pittsburgh won
the Pitt-Penn State Blood
Challenge. According to David
Edmunds of the Central Blood
Bank, Pitt received 2,247
registered "votes," 134 more
than Penn State this year.

A registered vote, Edmunds
said, is a pint of blood donated
in the name of either Penn State
or the University of Pittsburgh. In
the past, Edmunds said, Penn
State won because people from
Pittsburgh, including Carnegie
Mellon University students,
would donate and vote for Penn
State.

"Penn State got more votes at
Pittsburgh than at Penn State,”

Edmunds said.

The Pitt-Penn State Blood
Challenge began in 1983.

This year's blood drive was
held from Oct. 24 through Nov.
9. Pitt was announced the winner
of the challenge before the Pitt-
Penn State football game on
November 12.

”We' challenged University
Park [in 1983] to see who could
raise the most blood in a
2‘/2-week period,” Edmunds said.
Since 1984, Penn State has won
every challenge, but Edmunds
said this was due to Penn State's
higher population. Per capita, he
explained, Pitt has always raised
more blood.

This year, the number of votes
was based on the percentage of

 Conspiracy?

Seminar probes JFK assassination

By Brendan Kevenides and
Erik Kridle
The Pitt News

The validity of the Warren
Commission Report, which
describes the nature of President
John Fitzgerald Kennedy's assas-
sination, was questioned this
weekend during a three-day—long
seminar.

_ "This was one of the best pro-
grams we've ever had. I am very
happy about the way things
went,” said Student Government
Board President Craig Jackson,
who was amazed at the number
of people who turned out this
weekend. A

Jackson explained that people
from all around the country were
present as well as many interest-
ed students. He said that he was
"amazed” that about 400 to 450
stayed to listen to thespeakers on
Saturday from 10 a.m. until about
5 p.m.

Jackson commented that things
were slightly confusing when the
seminar began on Friday night;
for example, the light bulb on the
podium was missing. The rest of
the weekend went smoothly.

The seminar was reported as
the first gathering of some of the
most renowned critics of the
Warren Commission's findings

that a single bullet fired from the F

gun of Lee Harvey Oswald killed
Kennedy.‘

Although none of the critics
who spoke this weekend came
out and named Kennedy's assas-

sin, Jackson said that after the

seminar‘ he gained a new per-
spective on the historic event.

"The critics didn't come out
and say who did it," said Jackson,
"but from what I saw, organized
crime played a large role in the
whole thing. There is a lot of evi-
dence missing, but they know
Oswald didn't do it.”

The speakers included Dr.
Josiah Thompson, Robert
Groden, Dr. Cyril H. Wecht,
James H. Lesar, David Scheim
and Bernard Fensterwald Jr.

Pitt Professor Ted Windt,
moderated the event throughout
the weekend and began the semi-
nar-on Friday by giving a brief
history of the Kennedy adminis-
tration.

Windt said that despite warn-
ings that Texas was unruly,

Kennedy decided to go in order
to patch up the Democratic Party
in the South.

"We believed in America that

it couldn't happen here,” said

Windt about the assassination.
"Our innocence died along with
the president in 1963.”

Windt introduced the first
speaker, Josiah Thompson,
author of Six Seconds in Dallas,
who presented the argument that
Kennedy was shot by more than
one person. He also argued that
these shots came from a grassy
knoll area not described in the

‘ Warren Commission's report.

"The single-bullet theory is not
only wrong, it is silly,” said
Thompson. '

David Scheim, author of Con‘-
tract on America, who spoke on
Sunday, said that he believes that
the Mafia killed Kennedy. He be-
lieves that one thing pointing to
this conclusion is that the Mafia
at that time was facing a lot of in-
dictments under the Kennedy ad-
ministration.

Scheim also stressed, "We

need to deal with this, and if we .

don't, I think there is a good
chance that it will happen again."

Approximately ‘/4 of the na-
tion's college and university
faculty are unionized. In Penn-
sylvania, faculty have or-
ganized at Temple University,
Lincoln University and the 14
state-owned universities.

A ‘ group called United
Faculty, headed by English
Professor Philip Wion, would
like to accomplish the same
task at the University of
Pittsburgh.

"This will strengthen the
faculty's role in governance
within the university and give
them an opportunity to look at
the relative priorities and other
kinds of expenditures,” Wion
said.

"There needs to be a more
open budgetary process. Pitt's
[faculty] salaries need to be im-
proved significantly,” he con-
tinued.

Mary Ann Aug, director of
news and publications, said
faculty salaries have been a
"key concern” of the adminis-
tration.

"One of the university's pri-
orities has been getting faculty
salaries up to where they

should be,” she explained.
Aug also said elected faculty
representatives from organiza-

' tions such as the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences and the

Faculty Assembly are given ac-
cess to information’ about sa-
laries.

United Faculty began its ef-
forts in 1982 when the group
was formed from the merger of ’
members of local chapters of
the American Federation of
Teachers and the American
Association of University
Professors.

"By January 1984, a majori-
ty of faculty had signed peti-
tions in favor of an election to
decide whether or not to or-
ganize,” Wion said.

United Faculty then sought
approval of the election from
the Pennsylvania Labor Rela-
tions Board.

The PLRB ruled that, under
state law, Pitt's full-time faculty
were ineligible to participate
in the election because they
"have been found to be func-
tioning in a managerial role."

The PLRB also based its de-
cision on a 1980 U.S.
Supreme Court case involving
a similar situation at Yeshiva
University. The court ruled

UF continues efforts to unionize

that Yeshiva faculty were to be
considered managers, not em-
ployees, of the university be-
cause faculty served on
committees and other organi-
zations which had the power
to make recommendations to
the university administration.

After much dispute, 726
members of Pitt's part-time
faculty and librarians held an
election in late 1987. The
votes of 202 of those who par-
ticipated were challenged as
ineligible by Pitt’s administra-
tion, according to Wion.

Aug said both sides chal-
lenged the validity of some
votes.

"Since that time we've been
involved in trying to deter-
mine eligible ballots," Wion
said.

Wion added that United
Faculty is "quite confident"
that the outcome of the elec-
tion will be a vote in favorof
unionization.

The group also plans to ap-
peal the PLRB ruling excluding
full-time faculty from voting
on the issue. Wion said Unit-
ed Faculty willfile a lawsuit if
PLRB upholds its previous
ruling.

Sunday, shooting and killing a
22-year-old man and wounding
three Arab youths in clashes,
Arab hospital officials said.

In addition, a 9-year-old boy

The leaflet said the PLO had

On Sunday, Egypt became the

it hoped the proclamation would

At least 31 other nations, main-

Teacher recalls Russia’s

policies of expressionism

by Suzanne Sabol
Staff Writer

A Russian writer and educator,
persecuted in her homeland for
her creative ideas, came to Pitts-
burgh on Friday to speak about
how the recent changes in the
Soviet Union have affected her
life.

Elena Makarova teaches at an
experimental school outside of
Moscow. She began working
almost 10 years ago with art ther-
apy to help the students express
themselves. She used a one-on-
one approach with the children
that was considered ”unreasona-
ble.” The government monitored
her closely, because, she said that
in her country, ”creativeness was
identified with crime.”

Makarova tried to work within
the limits set for her by the
government, but she said that
”dealing with the system was
difficult, and it made no sense.”

At one point, as a punishment
for her innovations, her sculp-
tures and other works were de-
stroyed. 1

However, she continued to
teach because the children were
so important to her. Makarova
said that she feels a great sadness
because in her country, ”free

schools, including a school for
poor children in New York, she
thought that ”it was similar to
schools for privileged children in
the Soviet Union.”

During the past few years,
Makarova has begun to do
research on a new book. The sub-
ject of the book is Fndl Brandej-
sova, a Jewish teacher who was
sent to the Terezin concentration
camp during World War II. While
she was in the camp, she con-
tinued teaching the children
there. Brandejsova made her own
textbooks and collected drawings
from the children. Makarova said
that she found inspiration in this
story. ”lf she could teach in such
conditions, why should l
complain?”

The book on Brandejsova will
soon be published in the Soviet
Union. Makarova said that since
the policy of perestroika, or open-
ness, has started in the Soviet Un-
ion, it is easier for writers to have
their books published.

Makarova stressed the impor-
tance of cooperation between the
United States and the Soviet Un-
ion,,because, ”We live; we die;
we do everything the same. We
can compare our situation to

According to Edmunds, the
best way to increase student in-

active in recruiting donors. This
year, for example, the Pitt Greeks
raised 25 percent of the blood do-
nated by Pitt.

The blood donated by Pitt is
received by the Central Blood
Bank, which distributes the blood
to area hospitals. ”Centra| Blood

CHAMPIONS!!!

Volleyball team stays home to win Big East tournament .

By Don Boyd

Staff Writer

Led by tournament MVP
Denise Frawley, the Pitt women's
volleyball team dominated the
opposition in capturing the Big
East tournament championship.

The host and tournament
favorite Lady Panthers ‘met
eighth—seeded Boston College on
Saturday morning in their
opening-round match.

Showing how great the dispar-
ity between teams in the Big East
is, Pitt romped in three games
(15-1, 15-2 and 15-1).

With Al|—American candidate.
Frawley resting her arthritic feet,
the Lady Panthers were paced by

‘outside hitter Julie Shells (seven

kills and two service aces) and
middle—blocker Michele Adam-
son (fourkills, three blocks and
one ace).

In the third game, Pitt coach
Shelton Collier cleared the bench
and went with a lineup of sopho-
mores and freshmen, exclusive-
ly. The results proved that Pitt’s
Big East dominance should con-
tinue in the future.

In other opening-round action,
No. 4 seed Providence beat No.
5 Connecticut. in three straight
games and N'o.“3l'iGeorgetown di-
sposed Q;f:.*'-_'Villanova in like
fashion. F*.l‘r‘st-round action culmi-
nated witah»~.a Syracuse sweep of
Seton Hall.

In the semifinals on Saturday
evening, the Lady Panthers met
Providence University, a team
that had been surprise winners
over Pitt in last year's Big East
tournament.

The Lady Panthers received
standout performances from
Frawley, Adamson, Shells and
freshman Dee MacAulay in cap-
turing three consecutive games
(l5-7, 15-8 and 15-4).

Leading the Pitt offensive fire-
storm, Frawley tallied 14 kills as
well as four blocks for the match.

Adamson played an exception-
al match for the Lady Panthers at

the net. She had 11 kills on
offense while being credited with
six blocks on defense.

Shells totaled six kills in the
match as well as chipping in with
a service ace and a block.

Displaying a poise atypical for
a collegiate freshman, MacAulay
accumulated six kills, had four
blocks and a pair of aces.

In the other semifinal, Syracuse
made short work of Georgetown,
dispatching the Lady Hoyas in
three straight.

So the finals were set. A cohe-
sive unit of Lady Panthers would
meet a Syracuse squad most not-
ed for their height (sometimes
putting four players 6-foot-1 or
better on the court) and their
talented young setter Sherry
Cowling.

The Lady Panthers showed in
the finals that a threegame sweep
over Syracuse earlier in the year
was no fluke.

Led by the offensive fireworks
of Shells and Frawley, as well as
the tough interior defense put up
by the middle-blocking trium-
virate of Adamson, MacAulay
and Nora Mulvihill, the Lady
Panthers repeated the sweep rou-
tine for Syracuse (15-8, 15-8 and
15-9).

Shells exploded for 15 kills
against the Syracuse contingent.

Frawley contributed nine kills
and nine digs for the Lady
Panthers.

The battle between the top two
setters in the Big East was not
even close as Pitt's Jenelle Lan-
tagne clearly outplayed Cowling.

The a|l—tournament team con-
sisted of the Pitt troika of Frawley
(23 kills, four blocks and an ace
in two matches), Shells (28 kills,
two blocks and four aces in three
matches) and MacAulay (17 kills,
six blocks and three aces) as well
as Providence.College’s Debbie
Matejka, Georgetown’s Cathy
Taylor and Syracuse's Cowling.

Lantagne and Adamson.
though not selected to the all-
tourney team, gave standout per-
formances for Pitt all weekend.

Panthers fall apart in 14-3 loss to Wolfpack

By Vince Carey

Sports Editor

RALEIGH, NC — ”We weren't
good enough for a bowl bid,
that's why we are not going,” Pitt
linebacker Jerry Olsavsky said af-
ter the N.C. State Wolfpack
defeated the Panthers, 14-3,
Saturday.

This was Pitt's chance to show
everyone involved that they were
a good enough team to deserve
a bowl bid, but mistakes (four tur-
novers) and penalties (10 for 63
yards) made them look more like
a winless team than a team with
SIX victories.

”What do you want me to
say?” an angry Pitt coach Mike
Gottfried said. ”This was a lousy
football game. We couldn't get
anything going offensively; [we]
didn't do a very good job on
offense today.”

The loss dropped the Panthers

to 6-4 with one game remaining
(against Syracuse on Dec. 3).
N.C. State improved to 7-3-1 and
is headed to a Dec. 29 date with
Iowa in the Peach Bowl.

Pitt started out the game in fine
fashion. Freshman wide receiver
Baron Jackson returned the open-
ing kickoff 3O yards to the Pan-
ther 43 and the Pitt offense was
ready to roll. After a 7-yard Dar-
nell Dickerson to Henry Tuten
connection, Pitt went to the run.

Running back Curvin Richards
and Dickerson switched back
and forth, with a 5-yard Dan
Crossman- ramble mixed in, and
Pitt looked to be on the move.
Then something happened.
Everything just stopped.

The Panthers had a flrst-and-
goal from the 9 and couldn't put
the ball into the end zone, hav-
ing to settle for a 20-yard Scott
Kaplan field goal. Pitt led 3-0, but
that was as close to scoring as

they would come the rest of the
day.

”We came into the game a lit-
tle down,” defensive end Burt
Grossman said. ”It was pretty ob-
vious in the locker room; every-
body just moped around. Sort of
like a spring game or something.
It showed the way we played in
the first half.”

The defense was able to hold
the Wolfpack down on three
plays and forced a punt. Pitt
couldn't do anything with the ball
either and had to give it back.

Buried deep in their own end,
N.C. State started to get their
offense on track. They went
almost exclusively to the option
and rode down the field on the
shoulders of quarterback Charles
Davenport.

The Wolfpack moved through
the Panther defense with relative
ease, and 13 plays later, running
back Mal Crite leaped over the

pack for a 2-yard touchdown. The
extra point made it 7-3.

”Their option was running
well," Gottfried said. ”We were
able to control it better later in the
game, but early they ran right
over us.”

The teams traded a__couple of
punts and an interception (Pitt)
and fumble (N.C. State) before
either offense was able to do
anything. i

The Panthers got the ball on
their own 20 and moved to the
State 48 before having to punt the
ball again,

The Wolfpack, looking like
they had had enough of this,
picked up the ball on their own
17. After mixing the option with
a few pass plays, they were again
in the end zone. Fullback Todd
Varn ran over the left side for a
2-yard touchdown, and Damon
Hartman's PAT made it 14-3.

The second half was nothing

more than a defensive battle;
neither offense could get going,
thus the final score.

’’I think their defense played
well today, and I think, just as
much, our offense didn't play
well,” Pitt center Dean Caliguire
said. ”Offensive line-wise, I donft
think we played well.”

The Panther offense was led by
Richards’ 68-yards rushing and
Dickerson’s 144-yards passing.
The Wolfpack was led by Daven-
port's 124 yards through the air
and Tyron Jackson's 68-yards
rushing.

”We just came out flat,” Tut-
en said. ”You can't come out flat
and hope to wln.”

PANTHER NOTES: Senior
flanker Billy Osborn may have
played in his last game as a Pan-
ther. It is believed that he broke
his right collarbone early in the
fourth quarter.

lt’s not easy to forget about
three players —— Charles Smith,
Jerome Lane and Demetreus
Gore — who were the nucleus of
one of the top 20 programs in the
country for the past two seasons.

But that’s exactly what the Pitt
Panthers are trying to do in prepa-
ration for the 1988 season.

"were trying to erase last year,

- both the good points and the bad

points,” said sophomore point
guard Sean Miller.

The good points are memories
that the team will be hard pressed

to forget: a No. 8 final ranking in
the AP poll; advancing to the sec-
ond round of the NCAA Tourna-
ment for the second consecutive
year; winning the Big East regu-
lar season title outright for the first
time ever; boasting the Big East
Player and Freshman of the Year
in Smith and Miller; falling one
victory shy of tying the school
record for wins at 25... the list
goes on.

The bad points may have been
few, far between and silent, but
they were present: Sophomore
forward Rod Brookin was
declared academically ineligible
for the winter semester; junior

guard Mike Goodson was ineligi-
ble and left school; tempers flared
between Lane and Coach Paul
Evans; an overtime loss to Van-
derbilt in the second round of the
NCAA Tournament that had play-
ers questionin Evans’ coaching
afterwards; a £55 to Villanova in
the second round of the Big East
Tournament two games after the
Panthers wrapped up the regular
season title and after defeating
the Wildcats twice in the regular
season; and more than anything,
the pressure to succeed, consider-
ing the talent the Panthers pos-
sessed.

”We don't have those high ex-

All things must pass

Panthers want to forget last year, concentrate on ’88

pectations this year,” Evans said.
”This year, you don't have the
pressure.” ‘

Or the players who seemed to
make the Panthers a likely Final
Four contender. A preseason
coaches’ poll listed Pitt as the
fourth—place team in the league,
tied with Connecticut.

But the season hasn’t started
yet, and Evans is pleased with
what he's seen.

’’I think our first six players are
pretty good,” Evans said. Beyond
that he notes a lack of depth, par-
ticularly in the frontcourt.

”|t’s a just a matter of some
guys coming through for us,”

center Bobby Martin said.
Evans returns nine of last year's
players, including the foursome
of Miller, Darelle Porter, Jason
Matthews and Martin.

As freshmen last season, those
four averaged 28.9 points, 9.2 re-
bounds and dished out 319 as-
sists, 180 by Miller.

Evans sees promise in that
Hneup.

”Seton Hall learned how to
win last year, and they’ve got a
lot of kids coming back,” Evans
said, noting that his underclass—
men fell into the same category.

But Evans does have problems
this year, most notably the lack of
height at the frontcourt positions.

Martin and reserve for-
ward/center Steve Maslek are the
tallest players on the team at
6—foot—9.

That may seem tall, but com-
pare it to the rest of the Big East
teams, which all have at least one

We don't have those

year. We don ’t ha ve the

Evans

player that tall. 

"’lf we get Bobby [Martin] and
Brian [Shorter] in trouble, we'll
have some problems,” Evans
said.

Evans will pair Martin with
Shorter, a 6-7 forward who sat
out last season under Proposition
48, and eitherjunior forward Rod
Brookin or junior forward Nate
Bailey at the starting frontcourt
positions, depending on the op-
ponent

The only definite frontline start-
ers are Martin and Shorter, Evans
said.

But that doesn't mean Pitt will
be inept upfront. Shorter, Martin
and Brookin combined for 46
points and 23 rebounds — and a
43-32 total rebounding edge — in
a 97-82 victory over team Cibo-
na last week and, although Evans
said Shorter was intimidated by
a Cibona frontline featuring five
players over 6-9, he was effective,
to say the least.

’’I think Brian isgoing to be a
scoring machine eventually. i feel
he's going to be our best player
offensively,” Evans said.

But don't overlook the 6-6
Brookin, who regained his fresh-
man form by hitting three of four
three-point shots and scoring a
team—high 22 points against
Cibona.

”He is surprisingly quick,”
Evans said of Brookin, who en-
tered the season weighing 268
pounds, but is down’ to 238.

Big East tougher frm tp to bottom this year  

By Matt Martin
Sports Editor

If the coaches of the Big East
know anything about each
others’ teams —— which they un-
doubtedly do — then Geor-
getown and Syracuse will find
themselves atop the Big East Con-
ference when the regular season
ends in March.

A preseason coaches’ poll
branded the Hoyas and Orange-
men with with the No. 1 mark,
each receiving 60 points. Geor-
getown, however, received five
first-place votes to Syracuse's
four.

While these two teams clearly
have outstanding talent, -no one
is quite sure if they can hold off
a much-improved league.

’’I think the league, top to bot-
tom, is much better this year,”
said Pitt coach Paul Evans.

Even though five of the top
players in the Big East last season
graduated and are now playing in
the NBA?

”We lost Mark Bryant, but
we've got four pretty good peo-
ple that can do pretty well,” Se-
ton Hall coach P.J.‘Carlessimo
said.

Even though graduation hurt,
that seems to be the attitude of
most teams.

Take a look at the incoming
class and you'll see why.

Georgetown: Alonzo Mourn-
ing is the new savior — read the

next Patrick Ewing — of the
Hoyas. But the 6—foot-10, shot-
blocking monster from

Chesapeake, Va., has caused
more of a media stir than Patrick
E\Aiif1g..,év.éi did. This before he
has played a game for the Hoyas.

Some said he could have been
an NBA draft pick as a 17-year-
old. Georgetown coach John
Thompson disagrees.

’’If he wasn't a lottery pick, he
would have been very close,"
Thompson said _

”Patrick [Ewing] was more of a
runner. Alonzo is strong. Very
strong.”

But there's more to this team
than just Mourning. Olympic
point guard Charles Smith, who
averaged 15.7 points ‘last year,
returns to guide the offense, and
three other seniors and five
juniors also return at every spot
but center. Mourning will take
care of that.

Syracuse: Coach Jim Boeheim
seems to have a problem on his
hands. With the graduation of
center Rony Seikaly, he's not
quite sure who will play in the
middle.

Junior forward Derrick Cole-
man, 6-9, who averaged 13.5
points and 11 rebounds per game
last year, has shown displeasure
at the thought of playing center.
Six-foot-ten Richard Manning is
only a freshman, and 6-11 Erik
Rogers averaged less than one
point and only two rebounds per
game as a sophomore last year.

So what's Boeheim going to
do?

”We’re going to play the best
five players," he said.

And with Coleman, All-
American candidate and point
guard Sherman Douglas (16
points, 8.2 rpg) and super-frosh
Billy Owens, the Orangemen are
capable of doing that every night.

”Owens and Coleman —
they're certainly going to be on
the floor at the same time a lot,”
Boeheim said of the 6-9 forwards.

be On Onswer to some of your problems.

But the scoring doesn't stop
there. Guard Stephen Thompson
averaged 14 points and 4.8 re-
bounds last year, and forward
Matt Roe averaged 9.2 ppg, also
hitting 74 three-pointers.

”Every year it's Georgetown,
Syracuse and everyone else,” Vil-
Ianova coach Rollie Massimino
said at the Big East media day in
New York City.

This year, Villanova is that
someone else. The Wildcats lost
only two seniors, and only one of
consequence — 13-point scorer
Mark Plansky.

Returning are 7-1 center Tom
Greis, the most—improved'p|ayer
in the league last year, guard Ken-
ny Wilson, and forwards Doug
West, Gary Massey and Rodney
Taylor.

Those five combined for 55.5
points, 10.1 assists and 21.8 re-
bounds per game.

Massimino also brought in
highly touted freshman forwaid
Marc Dowdell and a cast of
others.

”Our freshmen are tremen-
dous,” Massimino stated.

With all this to his advanta e,

Massimino still worries.

”The schedule is just incredibly
difficult. Eight of our first nine
games are away.”

Against American University,
St. Francis, Vermont, Penn,
California, Drexel... see you in
the NCAAS.

Connecticut, which didn't lose
a starter from last year's NIT
Champion squad, has been billed
as a team with promise.

Coach Jim Calhoun admits that
is true, but adds, ”We have peo-
ple returning from a ninth—place
team.”

Talented people, coach. Six-
foot-eleven forward Cliff Robin-
son averaged 17.6 points and 6.8
rebounds last year and is a strong
contender for Big East Player-of-
the—Year honors. Senior guard
Phil Gamble, the MVP of the NIT,
averaged 15 points per game.
The remainder of the team aver-
aged a combined 26.6 ppg.

A standout recruiting class will
also help UConn jump to the up-
per echelon of the Big East.

Former walk-on now

wears the

stripes for

the 1988 Panthers

By Mike Rampa
Staff Writer

Backup point guard Pat
Cavanaugh is ready to fulfill
whatever role the coaches have
in store for him this season.

Cavanaugh started the first four
games of the 1987-88 season
averaging two points and two
assists.

This season he has been named
captain of the team, the first

'junior to hold such an honor
since Clyde Vaughan was captain
in 1983.

Cavanaugh appeared in 27 out
of Pitt's 33 contests and made
some key contributions to the
team. Although he didn’t put the
ball up much, when he did, he
was right on target, shooting 64
percent overall from the field and
72 percent in Big East play.

Cavanaugh’s origin with the
team is unusual, considering the

Captain Cavanaugh

type of player he has blossomed
into. Head coach Paul Evans is-
sued a call for walk-ons to sup-
plement his scholarship-depleted
squad prior to the 1986-87 sea-
son. Cavanaugh left the football
team, where he was a walk-on
quarterback, to play basketball.

During his freshman season,
Cavanaugh averaged more play-
ing time than any other walk-on,
approximately 10 minutes per
game. The best game of his
career came during his first sea-
son when he scored 13 points
against Seton Hall to propel Pitt
to its first—ever Big East Tourna-
ment win.

Cavanaugh was awarded a full
scholarship before his sopho-
more season and is willing to ac-
cept whatever role the coaches

want him to play. He does not
view himself in competition with
Sean Miller for the starting spot
because he fulfills a specific role
on the team.

Evans said of Cavanaugh, ”Pat
can be a good floor general for
us. He fits into a specific role. We
don't need him to score,» we just
need him to get the ball to the
right people. Pat doesn't look
pretty or stylistic, but he still gets
the results.”

Cavanaugh is not surprised by
the progress he has made.

’’I think hard work and the faith
I had in myself put me where I
am today,” he said.

,....-....~...

Cavanaugh expressed opti-
mism for the upcoming season af-
ter the Panthers’ exhibition game
against the Yugoslavian team Ci-
bona, which was stocked with
excessively tall centers and for-
wards.

’’I think we looked good over-
all. The first half we came out
pretty strong, but we've got to be
consistent the whole game. If we
didn’t hit the boards as hard as
we did, things might have turned
out different. Overall, I'm
pleased, and I think the coaches
were, too,” Cavanaugh said.

Rebounds will prove to be a
key factor in Pitt's success against
the teams they will face with a
substantial height advantage. Pitt
ran their fast break quite success-
fully after defensive rebounds and
caught team Cibona off guard a
few times.

”The big thing is our rebound-
ing. If we didn’t get the rebounds,
we couldn't execute our break.
But we did, and we broke,”
Cavanaugh said.

Evans feels Cavanaugh is quite
capable of running the Panther
offense. Fans will see a lot of this
constantly improving guard this
season, especially when Miller is
in foul trouble.

Shorter ready to back up lofty scholastic accomplishments

By Vince Carey
Sports Editor

Panther basketball fans have
been waiting a long time for high-
ly touted recruit Brian Shorter to
step out on the court.

Because of Proposition 48,
Shorter had to sit out his fresh-
man season and work on his
studies. He did more than that.
Shorter used the extra time to his
advantage by working in the
weight room and bulking up.

”Brian is just a strong human
being,” teammate Jason Mat-
thews said. ”He was in the
weight room every other day. It
shows in his play at practice.”

Shorter is 6—foot-7 and 235
pounds. He originally hails from
Philadelphia, but transferred from
Simon Gratz High School to Oak
Hill Academy in Virginia for his

senior year. At Oak Hill, he aver-
aged 24 points, 13 rebounds and
three blocked shots a game, but
that was two years ago. How will
he react to playing competitive-
ly again?

’’I’m ready to play,” Shorter

. said. ’’I love the game of basket-

ball. I'm just happy to get the op-
portunity to play again.”

Panther coach Paul Evans likes
what he sees in Shorter so far, but
admits that he has a tough hill to
climb.

”A year off and playing pickup
games is hard to come back
from,” Evans said. "But he has
improved his deficiencies in the
off year. He's improved as a jump
shooter and as a foul shooter.

”From what I've seen so far, I

T can tell he's going to be a scor-

ing machine. When he puts the
ball inside, he's going to score or

get fouled.”

Shorter plays the game similar-
ly to former Panther Jerome Lane
but is quick to squelch any talk
that he is just another Lane.

’’I’m my own player,” Shorter
said. ’’I don't compare myself to
anyone/’

For starters, Shorter differs from
Lane in that he is an outside
threat. He can put the ball up
from anywhere on the court and
have a good chance of making
the shot.

”The outside shot is always
something that I have prided my-
self on,” Shorter said. “There are
a couple plays designed for me
to shoot outside sometimes.”

The year off may have been a
benefit for Shorter. He was able
to get acclimated as a freshman
and get his grades up, but he isn't

Quickness may be the forte ot
this team. ”We’re going to play
a transition game,” Evans said.

Does that mean that the half-
court offense featured for the past
two years wil fade out?

Probably not, considering the
proven inside abilities of Shorter,
Martin and Brookin.

”We’|l play according to what
the defense gives us,” Matthews
said.

But with four possible starting
guards — three of whom made
the Big East All-Freshman Team
in 1987 — the Panthers will be
a ‘quick team.

Miller returns after setting a
freshman record with 180 assists,
while Matthews and Porter will
see plenty of time at the off-guard
spot

Junior team captain Pat
Cavanaugh will spell Miller.

Miller was excited about the
production the guards are capa-
ble of giving.

”The way I look at it, the more
the better,” Miller said. ”We’re
all right at the guard position.”

Providing depth at guard will
be senior Scott’Colombo, award-
ed a scholarship this year after
two seasons as a walk—on, and
freshman walk—on Derrick

Layton.

Junior college-transfer Gilbert
Johnson and Maslek are the front-
court reserves.

Without the benefits of a deep
bench, the Panthers will have to
hustle, do the intangible things
that make up a winning ballclub.

”We do have to get the loose
balls and rebounds,” Matthews
said. ”We have to keep our inten-
sity up."

”We have to get better on the
man-to-man defense and sliding
to the ball, and being in the help-
out positions,” added Shorter.

”We have to improve on
everything,” Miller concluded.

Brookin dropping new
weight and old image

By Matt Martin
Sports Editor

Rod Brookin may not be talk-
ing, but his teammates seem to
know what he is thinking.

’’I think Rod, by not playing last
year, has something to prove,”
said sophomore guard Jason Mat-
thews of Brookin, who has re-
fused interviews. ”He’s really
been a leader for us. It doesn't
look like he's lost a step.”

Brookin, who became academ-
ically -ineligible for the winter
term of 1987-88, is back, and in
his first game, he backed up Mat-
thews’ words, scoring 22 points
— nine on three-pointers —- grab-

shots and dishing out one assist

Four new Panthers

New faces on the Pitt
basketball squad this season:

0 Brian Shorter — After sit-
ting out his freshman season
due to Proposition 48, Short-
er appears ready to thrill Pitt
fans with the moves that made
him one of the most highly
regarded scholastic players in
the country in 1986-87.

Shorter, a 6-foot-7,
235—pound forward, was only

383 points shy of Wilt Cham- ‘

berlain’s Philadelphia city
scoring record at Philadelphia
Simon Gratz before transfer-
ring to Oak Hill Academy in
Mouth of Wilson, Va., for his

senior season.

As a senior, he averaged 13
rebounds and 24 points per
game; as a junior, 15.8 re-
bounds, 31.6 points and 2.6
blocked shots per outing.

Although Shorter was a
.monster rebounder before he
ever came to Pitt, he has im-
proved his strength and abili-
ties during his off year.

”He’s a strong human be-
ing,” said guard Jason Mat-
thews. ”! don’t know how to

Where they are

Where last year's departed
Pitt basketball players are
now:

0 Charles Smith, a 6—foot-10
center at Pitt, is a starting for-
ward for the Los Angeles
Clippers.

Smith, the Big East Player-of-
the-Year in 1987-88, was the
first-round draft pick of the
Philadelphia 76ers and the

Nuggets and the 23rd pick
overall.

Lane, who led the nation in
rebounding in 1986-87, left
school as a junior under the
NBA’s hardship clause.

He had his highest output of
the season —— 12 points — last
Saturday night.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, November 21, T988

Rod Brookin adds scoring stability to the Panther lineup.

Brookin——

Continued from page 12
agreed.

Brookin’s road to returning to
the Panthers has been a long one.
After averaging 10.2 points and
four rebounds as a freshman and
12.6 points and 4.8 rebounds in
five games last season, Brookin
was deemed ineligible to com-
pete for the remainder of the
yeah

He sat out the winter semester,
and after numerous rumors that
he would not return to Pitt, even-
tually enrolled in summer
courses to make up what he
missed.

Brookin entered this season
weighing 268 pounds in October
but has since dropped to 238
pounds. Pitt coach Paul Evans
sees him losing 10 more, noting
that his productivity will improve
once he sheds that weight.

Although Brookin has been
criticized for not speaking to the
press, Matthews is quick to point
out that it's nothing personal.

”He’s not trying to go out and
be Mr. All—America. He just
wants to prove something to him-
self,” Matthews said. ”Maybe
that's why he's not talking to the
press.”

While Brookin himselfwill not
carry Pitt to a title of any sort, the
Panthers are glad to have him
back.

Actually, just glad to see him
back.

’’I’m happy for him, happy to
see him out there,” Matthews
said.

Equally happy is Evans, partic-
ularly due to _Brookin’s first
showing.

”Rod is surprisingly quick,”
Evans said.

”Other times he's standing
around like a big load, though,”
Evans added.

For Pitt to be successful against
much larger teams, Brookin will
have to be at his best both on the
inside and outside game.

Apparently Brookin likes that
chaHenge.

”He likes taking the big shots,”
Miller said. ”He’s always been
like that.”

And this year, Pitt fans should
get a chance to see what Brookin
has always been capable of
doing.

 

Shorter

Continued from page 11
sure if the year improved his
basketball skills.

”l can't really say ifl would be
a better player now if I was able
to play last year,” Shorter said. ’’I
didn’t get to play against the com-
petition needed to get better. I
can tell you this — l am a lot
stronger.”

The inside play of Shorter can
help ease the Panthers’ lack of a
legitimate big man, and his speed
will help the team when they run
with the ball. Pitt's small, quick
team doesn't bother Shorter. In
fact, he feels they may be a little
better because of it.

”lf other teams try to use big
guys against us, we’ll just beat
them with our speed,” Shorter
said. “We have a fast team and
that will work to our advantage.
lf we can control the tempo of the
game, l think we can have a very
good season.”

In his first game as a Panther
(against visiting Cibona last Tues-
day night), Shorter scored 13
points and captured nine re-
bounds. He capped off his night
with a thundering dunk late in the
second half.

’’I think Brian was a little shaky
in the beginning,” Evans said.
”That will just come with time.
Once he gets into the swing of
things, all the butterflies will
leavef’

The part of the season that
Shorter is looking forward to the
most is when Pitt starts playing
their Big East foes.

”l can't wait to get to the Big
East,” Shorter said. ’’I’m going to
play every game the best I can,
but I know I'll be having the most
fun during the Big East season.”

This year, there will be a lot of

highly regarded newcomers in
the league. Syracuse picked up
blue chipper Billy Owens,
Georgetown got Alonzo Mourn-
ing (whom many believe to be
the best college center even
though he is only a freshman),
and St. John's picked up highly
touted forward Malik Sealy, just
to name a couple. Evans feels that
Shorter may have gotten lost in
the rush.

”Everything’s Alonzo and Bil-
ly Owens and the rest of them,”
Evans said.

Pitt center Bobby Martin sees
Evans’ point, but isn't sure if
Shorter was lost in the shuffle of
stars.

”l don't think he's been forgot-

ten,” Martin said, ”but Brian has _

a lot to show. He's going to come
out mad at the world.”

Panthers recruit blue-chippers

After signing only one
recruit in 1988, Panther coach
Paul Evans already has the in-
side track on another fantastic
recruiting class.

During the Nov. 9-16 early
signing period, Evans obtained
the signatures of three players
— forward Jamal Faulkner, for-
ward/center Danny Griffin and
forward Chris McNeal.

Faulkner, 6-foot-7, averaged
18.5 points, 11.5 rebounds
and three assists as a junior at
Christ the King High School in
New York.

He was named a Street &

5mith’s Third Team All-
American last season and was
listed as one of the top 12
players in the country in the
Big East Basketball Yearbook.

Faulkner attended summer
school this past year to keep
his grades up, the Big East
publication noted.

Faulkner was also consider-
ing the University of Texas.

Griffin, 6-foot—8 frontcourt
man from Crenshaw High
School in Los Angeles, verbal-
Iy committed to Pitt on Nov.
9. He is listed as a high
honorable mention recruit in
the Big East Basketball

Yearbook.

McNeal is a 6-8 blue chip-
per from Oak Hill Academy in
Mouth of Wilson, Va., — the
same school that brought Bri-
an Shorter to the Panthers.

McNeal averaged 25 points
and 13 rebounds at Oak Hill
last February after transferring
from Hermitage High School
in Richmond, Va.

He led the league in scoring »

there before transferring.

K 0 Another possible recruit is
Eric Mobley, a 6-9 center from
New Rochelle, N.Y.

quality reserve time in place of
one of the frontcourt starters -
Bobby Martin, Rod Brookin or
Brian Shorter — but has been
hampered by a knee injury
suffered in practice on Oct.
24.

Johnson, a muscular 235
pounds, aIso‘said that he has
a bone spur in his left knee
that juts into a tendon and will
require surgery following the
season. He presently wears a
brace on that knee.

’’He’ll be the big guy who

.will come in and take up
space and get the boards,” ‘
‘g Shorter said of Johnson.

Johnson scored his only two
points against Cibona on a
thunderous, game-ending
dunk and pulled down one re-
bound in seven minutes of
playing time.

Who should it be now?

Porter, Matthews vie for starting off-guard spot

By Matt Martin
Sports Editor

Someone once said that
defense wins basketball games,
but you can't win if you don't put
any points on the board.

In the middle of that cliche
stands Pitt coach Paul Evans and
his two sophomore off-guards, Ja-
son Matthews and Darelle Porter.

With the Nov. 26 season

I opener against Oklahoma State

rapidly approaching, Evans has
yet to name a starting guard at the
No. 2 spot. Sean Miller, of
course, will man the point guard
position, but Evans has a choice
to make for the remainder of his
backcourt.

”lt’s going to depend on who
we feel is playing better at tha ‘

  

time,” Evans said. ,

”DareIle sometimes gives us a
better spark coming off the
bench. Jason has the outside
shot.”

Evans started the 6—foot-3 Mat-
thews in Pitt’s 97-82 preseason
victory over the Yugoslavian
team Cibona on Nov. 15, and
Matthews gave Evans good rea-
son to continue starting him
alongside Miller: 20 points -12
from beyond the three—point

stripe — five rebounds and three F‘

assists in 24 minutes of playing
time.

’’I think all three of the [sopho— ”

more] guards are much stronger
this year,” Evans said. ”Jason has

improved his penetration this
year, and he's improved his
strength where he scores inside.”

What about Porter? The 6-4

guard entered the game against a

Cibona from the bench but came
out with possible starting stats —
six points, five rebounds, eight as-
sists and four steals in 27 minutes.

’’If Darelle could do that every
game, he would be tremendous,”
Evans said.

”He’s probably the best ath-
lete, the most complete player on
the team. He sees the court well;
he's probably our best passer,”
he added.

But who is going to start?

’’I haven't talked to Coach
Evans about it yet,” Matthews
said. ’’I don't know.”

’’If they were at different
schools, both could be starters in
separate lineups,” Evans com-
mented.

Matthews started the first 23
games of last season at the two-
spot, averaging 7.9 points, 1.5 re-
bounds and 1.6 assists per game.

Matthews also connected on
26 of 58 three—point shots.

Porter supplanted Matthews as
a starter on Feb. 27 at Connec-
ticut after Evans said that a long
season had worn his freshman
starters out.

’’I don't think you're going to

‘ see a letdown with these kids as

sophomores as you did [when
they were] freshmen. They had
just never played that long of a
season.”

Porter, who has grown since
last season, according to Evans,
was the starter for the remaining
eight games, averaging 4.9
points, 1.9 rebounds and 2.5 as-
sists for the year. Only three
three-pointers to his name,
though.

Still, where does each player
stand?

’’It’s up in the air,” said Miller,
who gained his starting spot after
only five games last season and
solidified it by averaging 9.3
points and 5.8 assists per game,
as well as being named Big East
Freshman—of—the-Year.

”Dare|le and Jason are players
who can do the job,” Miller com-
mented. ”DareIIe can even play
some three [small forward] if we
need him to.”

”Porter will have to play some
small forward sometimes,” Evans

Center of Confusion

Martin, 6-9, gives Pitt
 height problem against
'larger Big East squads

By Matt Martin

Sports Editor

A Bobby Martin may be Pitt's
center, but he’s even more than
that.
He's Pitt's center of confusion.
At 6—foot—9, Martin is one of
only three starting centers in the
Big East who is not at least 6-10.

0 Only Seton Hall has less height.

So how can Martin compete
against taller centers, particular-
ly with Pitt’s lack of overall front-
line size?

But the entire frontcourt
revolves around Martin, who will
get his baptism by fire on Nov. 26
against Oklahoma State.

The Cowboys sport Prop 48
sophomore Johnny Pittman, a 7-0
center, and 6-7 sophomore for-
ward Richard Dumas, who aver-
aged 17.4 points per game as a
freshman.

And once Pitt enters the Big
East season, Martin will face a
taller center nearly every night in
Georgetown’s 6-10 Alonzo
Mourning, Syracuse's 6-11

Richard Manning, St. John's 6-11

Robert Werdann, Villanova’s 7-1

Tom Greis, 6-11 Connecticut for-

He's not sure, but he's heard
enough speculation.

‘'1 had to earn this spot,” said
Martin, a high school Parade All-
American. ’’It remains to be seen
what I can do,. but people haven't
seen what 1 can do yet.”

Well, some have. Martin

‘scored 11 points and grabbed
nine rebounds -— eight in the first
half— in Pitt's 97-82 victory over
Cibona on Nov. 15.

But Martin's offense is not sus-
pect. Sixty—six of his 120 re-
bounds last season were
offensive, and he averaged 6.7
points off the bench, the best of
all non-starters.

g No, it's his defense that is wor-

*" risome.

Although Martin was second
on the team in blocked shots last
year, he had only 18 to Charles
Smith's 96. He was disqualified

this year. Martin must steer clear

of fouls.

”lf we get Bobby and Brian
- [Shorter] in foul trouble, we'll
have some problems,” Evans
said.

”We have to substitute a lack
of rebounding and defense for
scoring punch when he's not in
there,” point guard Sean Miller
added.

”Withou_t Bobby in there, we
slowed a little bit on defense,”
Matthews said after the game
against Cibona.

Martin has proven that he can
compete on the Big East level. He
was one of five members of the
Big East All-Freshman team last
season and was cool from the
line in the rugged Big East, con-
necting on 85 of 117 free-throw
attempts.

But should he get into foul trou-
ble, Pitt's small lineup becomes
even smaller.

Beyond reserve center Steve
Maslek, Pitt has only junior
college-transfer Gilbert Johnson,
.6-8, to provide any height in the
frontcourt.

Evans said he has been practic-
ing 6-5 junior Nate Bailey at pow-
er forward and 6-4 sophomore
swingman Darelle Porter at small
forward.

”Bailey’s going to help us, and
Porter's going to have to play
some small forward sometimes,"
Evans said.

The Pitt women's basketball
team, led by preseason All-
American candidate Lorri John-
son, is hoping to improve on last
year's 14-15 record and establish
themselves as a power in the Big
East in 1988. .

Three starters and 12 lettermen
return from a team that shocked
1986 conference champion Vil-
lanova twice last year and
reached the Big East tournament
semifinals with only one senior

thers coaching staff). Naturally,
Pitt head coach Kirk Bruce is op-
timistic about his team’s chances
this season.

”Our ultimate goal is to make
the NCAA tournament,” Bruce
said recently. ”There’s some
things you have to do to get there.
You have to either win the con-
ference outright or get an at-large
berth. And the Big East had two
teams in the tournament last
year.”

Johnson, who is switching from
power forward to small forward
this year, shooting guard Jennifer
Shingler and center Tabatha Long
should be the key performers for

Johnson rose to the top of the
game at various times last year,
and has impressed people around
the country enough to be men-
tioned as an All—American hope-
ful and a preseason second team
All—Conference selection. She
averaged 14.6 points and 6.2 re-
bounds last season and led her
squad in rebounds in conference
play, pulling down over eight
boards a game in Big East com-
petition.

Johnson also scored in the dou-
ble figures for 17 consecutive
games.

Bruce thinks that Shingler (9.5
points last year, three rebounds
and 101 assists), who has started
for the past two years, can aver-

”She’s just worked harder than

that's saying something,” the

He will face stiff competition
every night.

One thing might bev~i‘n»-Martin's _

favor: Evans.

While at Navy, Evans molded

a center by the name of David
Robinson as the 1986-87 Player
of the Year, and had somewhat
similar results with Smith at Pitt.

Smith was named the Big East
Player of the Year in 1988.

But if this is to be a learning
season for Martin, the Panthers
will suffer for it. Although Pitt will
have a chance to catch up with
the rest of the Big East pack
should they fall behind early in
the season — five of their final six
games are at home —— Martin will
have to come into his own by
then.

”[The home games] might be
better, if we’re not out of it by
then,” Evans said. ”We’ve got to
play Georgetown and Syracuse in
the first week [both on the road].
We'll know where we stand right
away.”

year playing both forward and
center and will be looked upon
to take over the inside game. She
was one of only five players to
play in all 29 Lady Panther games
last year.

’’If we can get good, consistent
play from those three, we're go-
ing to be tough this year,” Bruce
said. ”Our biggest concern with
them right now is keeping them
healthy and rested as the season
goes along.”

Shingler, Johnson and Long
will certainly be the crux of the
Panther attack, but a major por-
tion of the success of the team
could very well depend on how
well senior power-forward Amy

1 Holman can fill the shoes of

Deidra Baker, who was recently
declared academically ineligible
until at least January. Baker, a
senior, averaged 10.4 points last
year and equaled Johnson's re-
bound total.

”We’re going to miss Deidra

Baker, there's no doubt about -

that, ” Bruce said. ”We could
have her back at the beginning of
next year, but I'm not worried
about that right now. Right now,
I just want to get the girl academ-
ically straight. My whole
philosophy with this is not rush-
ing her back, so that she can
graduate on time and get her edu-
cation.

”|t’I| certainly be a lot tougher

-withouther, but I think there's a

chance we might be able to not
drop much in the quality of play
because of her absence.”

ly do the job offensively, as she.

Due to injuries and inex-

tion: the deficit. ltwill be the first and most important test
that Bush will face in the beginning of his presidency.

The GAO said that an explosion of new costs lies in
the immediate future: the nation's savings—and-loan cri-

sis, cleanup and modernization of the nuclear weapons

plants, and Reagan's SDI plan. ,

If Bush can manage to reduce the $155 billion deficit
without taxation and excess cuts, we must consider him
to be somewhat of a genius and a hero. However, since
he has shown us no clear signs of exceptional ability, we
must wonder if he is simply a fool or a liar.

Bush must seriously consider the recommendations of
the GAO in addressing the enormously difficult deficit
problem. Heroes don't solve economic problems; realis-

tic and honest leaders do.

In a nutshell...

”The.kinder, gentler George Bush is going to need his
best spitballer at the Republican National Committee.”

—— Mike McCurry, communications director of the
Democratic National Committee, on Bush's nomination
of Lee Atwater to head the RNC .

America and doughnuts for sale

There is a tremendous amount
of deal—making going on in the

United States nowadays. Just re-

cently, the management of RJR
Nabisco offered to buy out its

ARI
BUCHWALD

stockholders for $17 billion.
Another company, Kohlberg Kra-
vis, upped the bid to $20 billion
— and so it goes. There seems to
be no end to the spin-offs and
leveraged buyouts being made
on Wall Street. Many of the firms
being taken over or offered for
sale are in the food business.

So it came as no suprise to me
when Al Lentil, president of Unit-
ed Bread Pudding, said to me,
’’I’m making a firm bid for Ameri-
can Cholesterol.”

”What’s the deal?” I asked

him. «
”In exchange for United Junk
Buns, I'm‘ offering the stock-
holders IO billion jelly
doughnuts.”

”That seems reasonable,” I re-
plied. ”ls United Bread Pudding
worth 10 billion
doughnuts?”

’’It is if I sell off American’s
Chicken Fat business, as well as
its Computer Virus division. My
offer is contingent on spinning off
United’s Paper Flower factories,
and dumping our Hamburger

jelly"

Helper plants on the Japanese.”

’’I don’t understand why the
owners of American Cholesterol
would want to see the firm
broken up.”

’’It’s for the good of the stock-
holders. The book value of
American is three jelly doughnuts
per one cup of coffee. We're
offering six doughnuts, which is
much better than if they took
their dividends in Oreo cookies.”

”Suppose someone comes
along and makes a bid to buy
American for one billion animal
crackers?”

”|’ll top their price with two bil-
lion loaves of Wonder Bread. I'll
fight any unfriendly takeover of
my unfriendly takeover. I was the
first one who saw the value of
breaking up American Cholester-
ol, and Nabisco better keep its
cotton—picking hands off it, or I'll
crush every Ritz Cracker they
own.”

”What attracted you to Ameri-
can since you seem to be selling
off most of it?”

”They’re the biggest chewing
tobacco manufacturers in the
world. I figure any food compa-
ny that knows how to merchan-
dise chewing tobacco has a profit
potential.” I

’/What happens if the stock-
holders and management reject
your offer?”

”Then they have to pay me to
get me out of the deal. I won't set-

School, Christmas and credit card blues

Well, now, Thanksgiving is
upon us, and Christmas hangs
thick in the air. The. credit cards’

  

I/VILLIAM

YOUNG

in my wallet grow heavier and
heavier with each fading shop-
ping day. Every other person on
campus complains about how
bad this term has been and how

they can't wait for it to be over.

No doyfungo, it hasn’t.been
snowing yet, but does anybody
really care? The occasional ski-
enthusiast will comment about
how great snow is; occasionally
someone mentions the green-
house effect. .

The furor of the presidential
elections has mutated into end-
less TV shows about JFK. With
Dan Quayle’s becoming vice
president, will anybody dare try
to impeach Bush if he decided it's
time to sell weapons in exchange
for hostages?

The Post—Gazette ran an article
about Jerry Olsavsky the other
day. I wonder: If one of my
friends chased me onto one of the
Towers’ roofs while I was having
a BB gun war with him, would I
have to meet with Brenda Pardi-
ni to discuss disciplinary action?

Isn't it great how successful U2

has become? Bono used to com-
plain that U2 was the band that
was ”always coming but never
arriving.” It's kind of funny how
a band that started out with a dis-
tinctly Irish sound now fits in well
after a Debbie Gibson song and
just before a David Lee Roth
tune.

I guess it just goes to show that
if you dress up like a cowboy,
deny your heritage and sing
songs about Martin Luther King
Jr. and drug addiction, all the
post—punk psuedo-radical wanna-
be’s will jump on your bandwa-

_ gon. Maybe if Bono and the boys

took a bath and went back to
their roots they'd regain their
edge. But, then, the money is
probablymore important.

A special thanks to the person
who sent me a copy of The Gay
Mystique by Peter Fisher. I'm slat-
ed to read it just as soon as I get

to Mere Christianity by C.S.
Lewis and The joy of No Sex by
Swami Bhaktipada of Hare Krish-
na fame.

Football season is almost
over,and I've only been to one
game. Lucky for me I didn't buy
season tickets. This probably me-
ans I won't go to any basketball
games either.

For the first time ever I've
managed to create a schedule
with no classes on Friday. This
sort of schedule has eluded me
for the last 3‘/2 years, forcing me
to use the alternative of skipping
classes.

Last week marked the sixth an-
niversary of the Jonestown,
Guyana suicides, Mickey and
Minnie’s 60th birthdays, and the
conclusion of my 22nd year on
earth —— all on the same day.

key drumsticks, plus a seat on the
board of Eastern Airlines.”

”What will you do with the jel-
ly doughnuts?”

”I’m no fool. I intend to ex-
change them for some b|ue—chips
like Tofu Pizzas. I can't lose on
this because there are a lot of
pension funds that would do any-
thing to have all of their capital
in Tofu.”

”American Cholesterol was a
giant in the industry. Now since
you are spinning everything off,
will you still make a product?”

”The first thing to do when you
buy out another firm is to cut
costs. I intend to do that with a
vengeance/’

’’If you can't produce anything,
where are you going to get the
shredded wheat to pay off your
debts?”

”Once we control American,
we hope to have enough lever-
age to take over Dibbler’s Sour
Cream with the cash we made on
Mother Shapiro's Homemade
Linguini.”

’’Is there really a good chance
you can put this all together?” I
asked in admiration.

”There is no doubt in my mind.
All I have to do is get the bank
to OK my credit card so that I can

buy a shuttle ticket to Boston." ’
