ll/[eager student turnout ,
marks PIRG symposium

by JOYCE GEMPERLEIN

Three hundred and forty-three
red-and-gold chairs were waiting
for students in the Student Union
Ballroom,Tuesday. Counting them
was relatively easy, since about
328 of those chairs were empty.

And some of the speakers were
either late or missing.

and very real.

FASC ponders re/-opening ROTC I credit issue

by CINDY MORGAN

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences Council Wednesday considered
re—opening the issue of awarding academic credit for ROTC courses of-

. fered at the University.

Lynn Alstadt, student chairman of the ROTC Study Committee.
proposed that the Council (FASC) sanction a referendum of the Fac-

ulty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) to be conducted by mail to determine

if opinion has changed in the past few years. '

On December 3, 1968, FAS established the policy of awarding no
credit for courses in Military Studies. The Study Committee contended
that this decision was “strongly influenced by emotion," and "may
have been clouded overby anti-war sentiments.”

Alstadt also maintained that ROTC credit was abolished by a min-

' ority of the faculty (41 per cent votedgn the issue) and that the aboli-
~ tion was “contrary to the wishes of the student body,

in two referenda conducted in 1968'.

The first of these, conducted in January, showed that 69.5 per cent
of the 2,322 students participatingsin the Student Government election

The second referendum in November produced similar results. Of .

In its next several issues, the Pitt News will fea-
ture interviews with the six members of the Student
Government Board. Today's articles feature Dave
Bluey and Walt Wills. ‘

Walt Wills, newly elected member of the Stu— ’
dent Government Board, says that the most impor-
tant job facing the new administration is to organ-
ize both SG and the student body for a coordinated
effort.

"I'm very pleased with my fellow officers,"
Wills said. "I think we are going to be able to work"
together very well."

Wills stated, however, that he did not think this "  I
cooperation would be enough.

 
 

“I don’t think the seven Board members are
going to be able to handle all the student problems
by themselves,” he explained.“I think it's very im-
portant that students become involved in'Student
Government.”

 
  
 

It was pointed out to Wills that this traditional goal of Student Government has

never been realized in the past. Why should this year be any different?

“Mainly, the encouraging turnout'at the polls this year,” he replied. “Of course, it 5
still wasn’t as good a turnout as we’ would have liked, but I think that a certain momentum
was derived from the election turnout. It remains for the Board to develop and coordinate

this initial response by the students."

At the present time, Wills is not committed to any specific programs.

He did make'one statement, however. regarding salaries for members of stu-

dent organizations.

, “I don’t see a reason for salaries for members of Student Government,” he said,
adding, “However, regarding other student organizations, I:would have to examine their
budgets and »become_i,more‘familiar with the services theygpcrform before deciding.” L

At the time of the decision, Dr. James G. Holland, associate pro-

A fessor of Psychology, stated that “the faculty dropped credit for ROTC

not for political reasons, as charged, and not as’a result of student dem-
onstrations, as charged, but because credit for ROTC is inconsistent
with academic freedom and the independence of the University curri-
culum from external control. - '

“Protection of the student’s rights,” he continued, “to modify his
perspective and plans without undue risk (i.e.. to continue his educa-
tion in freedom), might well be an additional reason.”

Alstadt’s committee suggests that if a poll is sanctioned by the

FASC, and its results indicate that faculty sentiment favors the return -

of credit to ROTC courses, a committee be established to insure that
University policy is consistent with the majority view. '

Dr. Jerome Schneewind, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences,
said, “The present ROTC program, so I am told by officers, is richer
and more academically interesting, but most faculty members have
not been’told of this or convinced.” '~

‘Students attempting to eat in the Towers Cafeteria Monday night

BurtProvoznik termed, "a bind as far as production was concerned.”

Provoznik explained that Szabo was hampered by a lack of per-
sonnel which resulted when a number of employees called in sick.

“We didn’t plan far enough ahead in lieu of the fact that we
had so manypeople off," he stated.

Between 5:30 and'5:45 p.m., it became apparent that the.process-
ing system was not functioning atﬂmaximum efficiency.

Officials attempted to remedy the situation by pressing into ser-
vice food runners, managers, and other personnel. This situation was
difficult to implement, however, as many of these employees lacked

Provoznik reported that Szabo was “prepared to avoid this kind
of thing in the future,” but that it is impossible to predict such situ-

  Toffler anticipates rapid decision-milking

by GLENDA MINSHULL

Reflecting on the future, Alvin. Toffler
told a capacity 'Duquesne crowd Tuesday
evening, “It’s no longer simply business as
usual. The change is manifested intthep deep-
est revolution in human history.”

Toffler, author of the best seller Future
Shock, is considered an expert on the revo-
lutionary changes in society.

He equated the "Super Revolution” that
we are now experiencing, with the “Neoli-
thic Revolution”_ in relationship to the mag-
nitude of change involved. -

“The major difference between the two
is_that whilethe Neolithic Revolution was
completed in-a millenium, the Super Revo-
lution will take place within the next de-
.cades,” Toffler emphasized. '

Toffler outlined three basic processes -

which he said will reshape the future: ac-
celeration, diversity, and decline in the
quality of decisions. ’

Future shock will be an era of “in, out ~

and gone,” Toffler said, in which the 'accel-'

erating growth of technology, population,_

and transportation will result in drastic psy-
chological and social‘ alterations, “a sys-
tem of temporary human relationships.”

lasted for a lifetime. Now-a-days, there’s a
tremendous turnover of people, and its not
uncommon for a kid to have a dozen best
friends "during his lifetime. The constant

'pace is even changing our sexual lives. Sex

is a way of getting to know somebody bet-
ter . . . it’s a desperate search for instant in-
timacy.” Toffler said. '

Another problem to be faced, according
to Toffler, is the diversity that technology
offers. He disagreed with the assumption that

machines, in replacing man as the mainstay
. of the labor force, standardize man. Instead,

he sees man as confused in the face of the
technical options available.

“The result is that man is no longer able
to cope,” he said. “The melting pot of. hu-
manity is crack_ing,jand cracking in many
places._’’ i r '

Drawing upon a cause and effect analy-
sis, Toffler said that man’s inability to cope‘
has affected the quality of decision making.

/ Sketching the situation we face, Toffler.
said that as the world moves at a tremen-

dous pace, man must make on-the—spot deci-
sions that will immediately affect _the rest of
society. '

“Society is in a desperate race between .

our growing ability to make decisions and
the complexity of the faster acceleration _of

the decisions themselves,” he said.

Toffler was particularly critical of the.
public decision-makers presently holding of-
fice. He proposed three criteria for anyone
seeking public office, which would include '
a measure of the politician’s attitudes to- ‘
wards education, technology, and nationa-

lism.

Disturbed with the present,educational
system, Toffler sees the studentsof today
being prepared for a_n industrialized society,
which has been made obsolete by the Super

Revolution.

Instead, he would like to see more com-
munity control of the educational system,‘
resulting in a learning experience tailored to

the needs of today.

Despite the grim prospect of a future
which denies “the individual the right to
occupy his place in historic perspective,”
Toffler offers hope to the youth ‘of the world,
if they are aware of the disruptive web in

which our society is entangled.

“Some of my ideas may seem utopian,
but the, utopian course is the only, practical
course. We need Future Consciousness to

prevent Future Shock,” Toffler warned.

by EVAN PATTAK
Associate Editor

A fire hose ruptured on the ninth
floor of Tower A Wednesday evening,
flooding most of the eighth and ninth
floors and propelling a stream of water
down seven’ flights of steps and into the
Towers Cafeteria.

The hose "deposited as much as four
inches of water on parts of the ninth
floor that, in addition to pouring down the

mg.

Joseph Gil, Superintendent of Campus
Security, said that the flood caused

steps, leaked through the eighth-floor ceil-

“extensive water damage.” Articles stand-
ing on the floor, such as shoes and note-
books, were particularly hard-hit. Direc-
tor of Housing John Vrana said, however,
that no major losses had been reported.

Gil said that the rupture occurred be-
cause someone apparently tampered with
the hose.

“Someone closed the nozzle on the l

)7

hose, he said,

"and, then opened the
standpipe valve.” ' I

This, he _ said, caused pressure to
build inside the hose, an accordion-fold-
ed,. rubber-coated implement kept in a
wall cabinet, to 90-100 pounds per square
inch. Normally, the hose can_ withstand
about three times as much pressure, but

Gil said the manner of folding had pro-
bably weakened the hose. A

,“In allvprobability,” he said, “this
(the rupture) was because the hose re-
mained folded in its cabinet for a long
period of time. When this happens, the
folds become weak spots in the hose.”

Gil said that though the hoses weref

checked and backfolded-refolded to alter
the position of the folds-periodically,
neither was done onia regular basis. A

.He said that regularization of such.
actions was now being considered.

‘iIt’s a logical analysis of what should
be done in light of what happened,”_ he
said.

The hose burst about 6:35, shootilngla,
steady jet for roughly 20 minutes. Eighth:
and ninth floor residents moved their:

most valuable possessions to whatever dry;

spots they ,could find and begancarrying

the water to the bathrooms and dumping;
. it down the drains. ' - I

After two hours, most of the excess

water had been removed, though a custo.-I 
dial crew mopped-up throughout the

night.

“We could have used a 40,000 pound
sponge,” said Vrana of the cleaning ef-’ by

fort.

He added that no student had been. 
forced to evacuate his room because of ’_

the flood.

Towers torrent torments tenants

by EVAN PATTAK
Associate Editor

Richard Norris, ninth
floor (A) Resident Assistant,
was at a swimming meet when
they called him back,‘ to his
room. He should have grabbed
a bathing suit before leaving.

Norris found his room, 916
A, under several inches of
water. He was lucky. Though
his rugs, valued at.$80, seem-
ed ruined, a quick-thinking
campus policeman and a friend
from the eighth floor had re-
scued $500 worth of stereo
equipment.

Pat Kader was not lucky.
When the fire hose on the
ninth floor ruptured, it shot
a steady torrent of water at
Kader’s door. The flood dump-
ed about four inches of water
on Kader’s.floor, ruining ev-
erything on it, and leaked to
the floor below.

Which surprised Jimmy Col-
ton, lying on his bed in 815.

‘‘All of a sudden,” "Colton
related, “a whole bunch of
people started knocking, on
the door yelling ‘Flood, flood,’
I 'didn’t think anything of it,
because the guys on this floor
are always doing something
like that. Then all of a sudden
I noticed water coming from
the ceiling. Then it was like a
thunderstorm.” '

"The water drowned a stack
of ._.Colton’s notebooks and mag-
azines and a lab report me-

ticulously ‘assembled the day‘
before by his roommate, Jan’

Ornato.

Colton tried to drag his
rugs to a dry spot, but they
were too waterlogged.

“I tried to lift them up,”
he said shaking his head,”
they must have weighed 70

- pounds apiece.”

Seventh and sixth floor resi-
dents were ready. They dam-
med the by-now dank current

. by spreading dozens of WPGH

blotters and copies of the Pitt
News on the floor aroundithe
doors.

Though rooms nearest the

steps experienced some flood-. A

ing, the stream was stopped on
the sixth and seventh floors.
But it cascaded unmolested
all the way down into the
Towers Lobby, where it lay
in stagnant pools, and into the
Cafeteria.

When, after 20 minutes, the
hose stopped spurting, the mop-
up work began. Kader grabbed

garbage cans, filled them with b
wategsloshed to the bathroom, '

and poured the water down
the drain. Colton swept water
out of his room with whatever
he could find-sheets, brooms,

 

sweepers-while Ornato pushed
a squigee around the eighth
floor. Norris toted the sopping
carpets from "his room and
stretched them out in the
ninth-floor lobby.

Two hours later, thanks-to
a combined; effort from all’
eighth and ninth floor resi-
dents and the custodial crew,
things were almost normal-
genial but slightly mildewed‘:

One ninth floor
complained that the campus‘
cops had acted gingerly for
"fear of getting their uni-
forms wet,” Kader, drenched
to the knees, vowed that he ,
would scale the heights of 
Tower Band C and slash the
fire hoses on the top, floors. _

Usurped facilities irk women

(Editor's Note: The following letter was sent to Professor Carl A. Pe-
terson, co-ordinator of Men's Physical Education, and the Pitt News.)

Dear Dr. Peterson:

‘ A group of. University of Pittsburgh women have been gathering
regularly on Sunday afternoons to play basketball since November 7.
1971. They have experienced repeated difficulty in their attempts to
use the Women’s Gym at Trees Hall, even though the printed recrea-
tion schedule in the possession of Security Guard Dorsey states that
the Trees Hall recreational facilities are open on Sunday afternoo IS.-

At times they have been informed that the Women’s Gym is not
open on Sundays and have experienced difficulty in obtaining basket-
balls. and have had difficulty keeping the men from entering from the
Men’s Gym and taking over all of the courts in the Women’s Gym.

It has often taken as long as two hours to gain access to the Wom-
en’s Gym, its equipment, and facilities. .

The most serious incident. however, occurred last Sunday, Jan. 23.
at approximately 2:30 p.m. While the women were playing basketball.
two men, one of_them Wade Lawson. came from. the Men‘s Gym into the
Women's Gym wanting to play on thecourts. ‘

They were informed by the women of your statement that no men’
were to use the Women‘s Gym while women were playing there. After -

several threats and a great deal of abusive language on their part.
these men left to return short_ly with about 30 other men who proceeded
to play basketball while Wade Lawson argued, intimidated and threat-
ened to have the Women's Gym made into an "Everybody’s Gym."

He stated thathe had the right to go anywhere in the Universityand
refused to leave. ' _ , .

At this point. one of the women went to inform one of the security
guards of what was happening. After somefconversation, Officer Dor-
sey left with Wade Lawson for the purpose of calling Dr. Peterson.

‘ After being informed that Dr. Peterson wanted no men in the Wom- I

en's Gym while the women were there. Lawson refused,as the leader

of the men, to cooperate with Officer Dorsey and Officer Conroy. _who. i

had by now. joined Officer Dorsey. ; V e

Officers Dorsey and Conroy refused to take effective and signifi-
cant action to remove the men from the Women’s Gym, on the basis
that we the women.“didn’t want any bloody trouble did we?”

All they did was turn out the lights,,which had no effect on the
M.en’sGym. They further undermined their own authority in the situa-
-tion by informing the men that it was ridiculous that they could not be
allowed to play in the Women’s Gym and that they were sorry to have to
_enforce this ruling. .

’ In fact, the men stayed until their game was finished and the

' ‘ guards did nothing but stand and wait, while Wade Lawson threatened to

~ come and use‘ all the women’s facilities, including the lavatories and
showers. 5 I '

The Men’s Gym supervisor said that the name of the Women’s
Gym was going to be changed to “Small Gym.” When Officer Dorsey
asked Officer Conroy if he should get further reinforcements, Officer
Conroy said no. So much for equal protection under the law.

There was a woman using the far side of the Women’s Gym for the ‘

* purpose of dance exercises and workout. She was forced out of her prac-
tice area by the men’s basketball game and disruption.

We trust that you will take care of the matter to our full satisfac- -

tion. We would sincerely appreciate an opportunity to discuss with you

the matter- of equal supervision,(in light of potential legal dangers to ,

the University), equal facilities and equal programming for women.

We would also like to tour the facilities at Trees Hall. We also A

would appreciate .4 your publicizing‘ these services as well as the
‘ schedule of events for women’, including women’s basketball on Sun-
days from 1'to 5 pm. in the Women’s Gym.

We look forward to hearing from you on this matter.

;.'§. Earlier this month the Student

‘ Affairs Committee of the Univer-

._l‘ . sity Senate held six hours of open
f 1 .. hearings on registration and bill-

‘ ing procedures. From a year’.s ex-

 .. -perience as a clerk in the Regis-
~"'.i trar’s Office and the information -
‘f__« , -brought forth at the hearings, I
 ‘ would like to share a few obser-
 yations.

The scourge of the registration
system is inaccuracy. Inaccuracy
_ .makes students stand in lines to
. correct mistakes, leaves faculty
. to their own devices to deter-
-mine ,who'is enrolled in their
' classes, and entangles the admin-
4 istration in. complicated editing
__and duplication routines.

" ; The‘ malaise is compounded ‘by

"the slowness of the system. The.

time between‘ a change of ad-
dress being submitted by a stu-

‘dent and the accurate recording

of that change on the computer
tape may span terms. In that time
invoices, grades, and other im-
portant information may be
going to the former address.

The sources of the inaccuracy
range from the student’s illegibly
writing his/her social security
number on the change of address
form to a keypunch error.

Nonetheless,. the output is in-
accurate. Instead of passing the
blame from office to office within
operations and onto the students.
as is the traditional practice,
there should be constraints_de—
signed within the system that
could minimize thechances of in-
accuracies. ’ -‘

-» jA system‘ that“min_imizes’ the

chances» of mistakes and imme-
diately detects the ones thatdo
occur is one that would provide
students with their invoices at the
time of registration. To hook such
a system into the present system
would only tax an already over-
burdened system.

However,. a— small (desk
sized) unit rents relatively cheap-
ly. This small unit could be used
to collect data which would
then be fed into the main compu-
ter.

The ‘students would stand in

line and have their class cards.

pulled. ‘as now. These cards and
the student’s permanent ID

would then be fed into‘ the ma- ~

chine. Ads for such machines
promise invoices at the rate of six

, per minute. Theuse of the perma-
nent ID and the pre-punched cards .

‘would eliminate the writing er-
rors. Any errors that would occur
could be detected immediately

and corrected by keypunching the,

correct information onto a card
that could be fed into the machine.

I would like the Vice Chancel-
lor of Operation’s staff to investi-
gate the costs and feasibility of
such a system and to report their
findings to the Universityvia the
Pitt News _or some other general-
ly available source either by

grade time this term or during the

first month of next term.
. During the course of the hear-

ings, Vice Chancellor Dutton men- .

tioned the existence of a. task
force withinlOperations which is
investigating solutions to g the
problem. What concerns our com-

_mittee is the degree‘ of accoun-
tability, of the ’-‘task ‘force to, the

."

University community. There 

no‘ students or faculty on this task
force. The various schools will
have the opportunity to review
any proposed changes before they

‘are implemented, but, somehow,

accepting or rejecting a ready-
made package short-circuits the

process by which needs are pro- '

grammed into the system.
It is as if the schools and the

I students will be fitting themselves

-into the system rather than the
system being designed to fill the
needsof the schools and the stu-
dents. There should be coopera-

tive development of systems, not ‘

this buying-selling arrangement.

twin addition to the evaluation of O

my present proposal, I call for a
public evaluation of the entire

.,_ system. Such_a general report has.

been made. .. '

An atmosphere of

trust

Triend

by PEGGY VANNOSDEL

Students interested in joining “A
Little Help from Your Friends” can
do so by stopping in at the Mc-
Cormick Annex or by calling 687-
574.5.

I thought when I got there. no
one would say anything.

No one is going to start talking
about their problems. ask ques-
tions, or seek advice when a re-
porter from the Pitt News is pre-
sent. Especially if their problems
are concernedwith drugs.

I was wrong.

Everyone who approaches the
door that reads “A Little Help
from Your Friends” knows that
he will be totally accepted into an

_ atmosphere based. on trust, frank-

ness, relaxed conversation, and
security upon entering the room.

"A Little Help from Your
Friends? begins operating at 8
p.m.. but I didn't arrive until
10:15 p.m. when there were only
three people in -the McCormick
Annex: Bill, Chuck, and Jay.

Bill is the assistant coordina-
tor of the organization, under
Herb Simmons who is the coordi-
nator. Jay is a student volunteer
from Pitt and Chuck is a student
volunteer from Duquesne. I intro-

s’ offering   help 

duced myself even though I had al-

ready met Bill at a previous inter- _

view.

I was greeted warmly by all
three. One took my coat, another
told me to sit where I’d be com-
fortable. I decided to take a seat
on the couch.

They were in themidst of a dis-
cussion about a client. whom-I’ll
call Tom, with family problems.

. Tom is intelligent, but in narrow

fields. He won’t accept any job
except one in engineering, much
to his family's dismay. He would-
n’t "lower himselfito work in.
say. McDonald’s" and keeps shift-
ing in and out of jobs. explained
Bill. ’

Clients’ problems
course, related in confidence.
Frequently, clients are referred
to agencies which are uniquely
equipped to help them.

.»

The conversation about clients
and their problems continued like
this for the rest of the night. But
it wasn’t boring. Even though a
phone call did not come through

once while I was there, a lot of

people came to “visit” the stu-
dent volunteers or just to “drop-
in” to say “hi.” I soon began to
discover what was happening. In

"an indirect way, “visitors” even

receiving help.

JAY offers companionship, positive self-experience."

“Hey, hi! We haven’t seen you
here for a while. How have you
been living?"

"Oh, I’ve been keeping myself
occupied. Right now. though. I'm
kinda‘ stuck for a place to crash
tonight. ‘Know somewhere I could
lay my head?“

Many, I noticed, were just sim-
ply looking for a companion,
someone to talk to, someone to
listen to them.’ A few, I over-
heard, hadn’t,been home since
they were 16.

Especially common are calls or
visits from students with drug
problems. I found that the volun-
teer tries to take each individual
and find out why he feels he needs
drugs. If .he can find out why, he’s
lucky. Usually he can’t.

client toward “positive self—ex-

perience.’-’ This "experience“

The administration and the new
Student Government are anxious
to cooperate closely this year. but
SG will’ resist any possible at-
tempt at control.

Officials in the administration
are optimistically looking forward
to close ties with the newly elect-
ed Student Government Board, in
an effort to avoid the recurrence
of the poor credibility associated
with previous Student Govern-
ment administrations.

Student Government Board
members share the same-goal as
the administration, but they are
not willing to "allow the adminis-
tration to maneuver them,” ac-
cording to Dave Bluey, newly
elected member of the Board.

Alfred Moye, Dean of Student
Affairs, and members of his staff,
including‘ Director of Student Ac-
tivities Bill Markus and Assistant
Director of _Student Activities Bill‘

the Board. .

They hope to meet on a regular
basis to acquaint the Board with
procedures to be followed in or-
der to fulfill their responsibilities,
Lenaghen said.

Board members, however. do
not- recall discussing any such
meetings. Board member Terry
Weaver said that the Board had
tentatively decided upon Tuesday
evenings for meetings, but that
they had not included input from
the administration in their plans.
Instead, they view the adminis-
tration as "source material,” act-
ing in an advisory capacity only.

Both the administration and the
Board are enthusiastic about the
restructured student government.
All concerned are anxious to avoid
repetition of the “anarchy before

Moye described previous student.

Board structure would allow the
members to work towards com-
mon goals. '

by LINDA COOPER ,

._ Twenty-three years is a long

1 time for any relationship to last.
.But though that is how long Pro-
fessor Lawrence Lee has been
teaching English at the'University
 of Pittsburgh, he can still ex-

1 claim, “I’m very happy here. I've .
enjoyed the hostilities as much
as the friendships.” ‘

Lee manages to squeeze every
‘measure of life out of each of his
I '. varied /experiences. He has not
spent his years at Pitt in the quiet
solitude that academita some-
times affords.

Speaking out through poetry,
journalism, and academic policy,
‘ he has contributed an active voice
to University and community af-
‘I . fairs. His opinions are not always» -
popular, but he does not emerge battle-scarred from
encounters with his opponents. Instead he refers
» 1, to himself as a “happy warrior."

His outlook on racism, for example, might be
considered controversial.

A “It is as racist to be pro—Black. pro-Jewish. or
pro-Southern as it is to be the opposite." he said.
"and at the University of Pittsburgh, particularly
on the administrative level. there is this atmos-
phere of reverse racism.”

Although there is a sincere effort and a com-
manding need to make an amelioration to Blacks
_ and other minority groups deprived by society of
equal opportunities, Professor Lee said he does’ not
feel that the solution is reached through a destan-
dardization of admission policies of universities
like Pitt.

, “It does not follow that a degrading of the val-
ues of higher education will aid anyone,” Lee claim-
‘ - ed. “It will only deprive intellectually equipped stu-
dents of their receiving the full value of their ex-I
pended potential.” , _
Instead, Professor Lee sees the solution in
compensatory education at other levels.‘
 “It is easier to bring men up to institutional val- .
 \ ues rather than to bring an institution down to ill-
S ’ equipped men,” he stated. “It is entirely possible to

At the heart of his criticism,
Professor Lee believes that it is
“a social falsehood to indulge the
vanity of shallow administrators
who imagine that they are leading
the revolution.

"The loss of form and value in
education” is what Lee objects to. -
Thus he is also opposed to such
proposals as those enabling a stu-
dent to earn a Master‘s degree be-
fore completion of his Bachelors
degree'and to acquire credit to-
ward an M.A._ degree for "life ex-

{perience equ_ivalencies.“ '
measures." _
only provide students with the conceit that they have
an education on the master's level." ’

Although he has acquired numerous critics,
Professor Lee is most saddened by the cliched
thinking he finds among many indiscriminating stu-
dents. To him, this can only mask the truth.

He said Thomas Jefferson spoke for him in tell-
ing prospective teachers at the University of Vir-
ginia. “For here we are not afraid to follow the
truth wherever it may lead. nor to tolerate error so
long as reason is free to combat it." —

However, as Thomas Jefferson is claimed as
a_ political ancestor. the poetical Lawrence Lee
claims Aeschylus for his literary ancestor. This is
another side of the professor. one that he would
rather be known for than anything else.

"He has published seven volumes of poetry and
has recently taped his poetry for the Library of Con-
gress. He has had a number of books published,
probably the best known being The Cretan Flute.

Lee’s short stories have appeared in American
magazines such as the Saturday Evening Post, the
Sewanee Review, and the Virgina Quarterly Re-
view and in foreign magazines. '

His poem “Heroic Journey" appeared in a vol-
ume of- The.Best Short Stories of 1967. Lee also gave
the University the first Phi Beta Kappa poem from
Pitt. “The Cathedral.” ~

Science-Fiction clubs:

unique sub-cultiire

by STEVE LUBETSKY

Like .most organizations. the
Western Pennsylvania Science
Fiction Association involves col-
lection of dues. regularly sched-
uled meetings. and election of of-
ficers.

Beyond these routine proce-
dures. however. WPSA ceases to
resemble other groups.

“We and all connected clubs
constitute sub-culture, as de-
clared by several
gists,” Chapter President Topher
Cooper remarked. “We are a uni-
que sub-culture, the largest Anta-

critical group in the world that is,

actually working.”

WPSA. according to Cooper. is
“a bunch of people with similar in-
terests. We hold meetings. occas-
sional parties. organize trips, and
exchange magazines."

The groups main project. said
Cooper, is its arrnual convention
called PgLange. held in Septem-
ber. Activities at this event in-
clude lectures.b_v authors, panel
discussions. films. exhibits. and
sales of science fiction books and
magazines. Such gatherings are
held inother cities throughout the
year. though the International is
the major extravaganza.

In outlining the various types
of science fiction -enthusiasts,
Cooper referred to three general
categories: “readers, occasional
readers, and fans.”

"Fans do more than read.“ he
explained. "They are in ‘fanacts,’
which are fannish activities. They
send letters to fannish maga-
zines. write articles and stories.
and attend conventions and meet-

anthropolo-

ings.“

Cooper described people most
inclined to join science fiction
clubs as "strange.“

.“Most fans are outcasts from
normal society and find that
there’s a group of similar out-
casts that they can relate to,”
Cooper asserted. “They further-
more tend to be intellectuals.”

Discussing the structure of
WPSA. Cooper admitted that
"originally there was complete
anarchy.“ The past president.
Ginjer Buchanan. then "took over
as dictator. and now I am the
leader.“

He emphasized. though. that in
his position as "absolute ruler,“
he acts as a “benevolent dicta-
tor." '

“They usually call me ‘den
mother,’ or ‘sargon,”’ he said.

‘The Sargon,” Cooper explain-
ed, “takes care of business. Fur-
ther than that, it’s free-form. and
the members do what they want.“

WPSA’s size, said Cooper, is
“amoeboid, it changes constant-
ly. Usually 10 people come to
meetings and membership is de-
termined simply by who shows
up.”

"People are encouraged to come
to the first meeting, since it is
free. and they can decide if they
like it then.“ stated Cooper. The
members, he continued, bear no
obligation, but simply pay. a quar-
ter-at each consequent meeting.

Meetings are held every Sunday ‘

at 2 p.m. in Skibo Hall at C-MU.

°OldMan’s Place’ houses

by CINDY MORGAN
Entertainment Editor

These days Hollywood doesn't
seem capable of making a film
with a happy ending. It is far more
profitable, they believe. to load a
film with violence, killing off one

, or more of the "good guys."

The formula has worked for a
-long time, too, but the public is
growing weary._ For once they
would like to leave a theater

' laughing, rather than cognizant of

a host of new problems.

Producer Philip Waxman’s The
Old Man’s Place promises. .at
first. to be an exception. Unfor-
tunately ‘the film dramatically
turns, leaving you with a,horrify-
ing conclusion. A

Trubee Pell is a young soldier

He is plagued by his memories,

him of the Vietnamese woman he
killed, a death be partially
blames on his father, a death for
which guilt causes severe intro-
version.

His pal Jimmy Pilgrim is his
foil, possessing the intelligence
and bearing of a cave man. He is
the kind of guy who is puffed up
with self-importance, but one for
whom you feel sorry. Where Tru-
bee-is blond, bitter, and quiet, Pil-
grim is out—spoken' and raucous,
and the brunt of misfortune.

Both arrive fresh out of the
service in San Francisco escap-
ing their problems, and looking
for a couple of friendly girls to

make time go by faster. (Pilgrim~

slaps for their efforts.) They fin-
ally resort to a bulletin board at

Artur Rubenstein, that grande
seigneur of the keyboard, visited
Pittsburgh this past week with
la_udable results. The distinguish-
ed octogenarian presented Schu-
bert, Brahms, Debussy, and Chop-
in to an overflowing audience at

- Heinz Hall with mastery that has

characterized his performances
for half a century.

As a "natural” pianist, Ruben-
stein fills all the qualifications:
broad palms, flexible fingers, a
little finger as long as his mid-

dle one, and an enormous stretch-

which takes a twelfth.

Playing the repertoire since the

age of four. he has concentrated
largely on Chopin, but has hardly
forgotten other composers.

’ Opening with two Schubert Im-
promptus that rippled along like
water in a brook, his “golden
touch” was apparent throughout.

him. and Jimmy Pilgrim, to his
old man’s run-down farm. And
as he so innocently comments
later. “This is the worst idea I've
had all year." '

Poor Jimmy becomes Flood-‘s
private punching bag. Trubee a
pawn. the old man a soldier to be
drilled. Flood runs the whole
show until Pilgrim puts him out
of commissionwith a bullet. Un-
fortunately, this old soldier
doesn'tdie.

When Flood recovers, it seems
as though everyone will .“turn

over a new leaf,” so to speak. It is
then that things start getting

noises mar

wonderful scherzo full of keyboard
gymnastics.

I fear that the charm of this
lengthy work was disrupted by
the gauche insistence of the audi-
ence to applaud between move-
ments. In addition, strange noises.
from the Hall’s ventilation sys-
tem hardly added to the enjoy-
ment of Rubenstein‘s technique.

Three works of Debussy follow-
ed intermission: the very pro-
grammatic Mermaid and Gold-
fish pieces and the sonorous Pre-
lude in A minor. Tone painting is
part of Rubenstein’s art and it
was brightly displayed in impres-.
sionistic compositions such as
these. that were probably the
high point of the evening for
many. -

A Rubenstein recital always in- I

cludes works of Chopin and there
were three Chopin works ‘on the
program: Barcarolle‘ (opus 60),
Nocturne No." 2, and the ever pop-
ular Polonaise in A flat.

a newcomer and does a passable

- job, However, Mitchell Ryan as '

the grim Sgt. Flood, Arthur Ken-
nedy as the grizzled father. and
William Devane as the comical
Jimmy Pilgrim are the film's
key successes. I

The film rolls smoothly, neatly
contrasting the fast—paced down-
town San Francisco life with the
lush countryside of Trubee‘s
home. Grimness is often masqued
with humor to alleviate the tense
atmosphere so efficiently created
with dialogue and camerawork.

Rubinstein

Compared to most renditions of
the last work, Rubenstein’s was
terribly over pedaled, thus dis-
torting much of the vitality of this
composition. It is most certainly
the sort of work that demands
bravura but not to the extent that
the pedal is pushed to the floor
throughout. Other than this. his
spirited version brought bravos
from us all.

It was a memorable evening but
many difficulties marred the
beauty of it all. Strange noises
throughout the Hall, the discovery
that musical sound is somewhat
muffled in the main floor area

Simple-minded indeed. The weak-
nesses of the original play have
been amplified. with the screen-

»play’s revisions magnifying the

constructions inadequacy beyond
the point of even vague accep-
tance.

Harold Ryan (Rod Steiger), kill-
er of menand beasts and missing
for eight years, returns to find his
wife Penelope (Susannah York)
on the verge of remarriage. Ac-
companying him is his buddy,
Colonel Looseleaf Harper (Wil-
liam Hickey), none other than the
man who’ dropped the bomb on
Nagasaki. “I dunno, boy,” he con-

 

 

stantly repeats.

Neither do I. Nor does anyone
else. for that matter. Ryan's en-
counters with his wife. sappy son
Paul (Steven Paul), and Pene-
lope‘s two "lovers," a peace—lov-
ing doctor (George Grizzardl —
her fiance—and Herb Shuttle «Don

uum cleaner salesman. are illogi-
cal. to say the least.

Of course. so is Vonnegut. While

Howe offers superb and imagina-
tive solos on both acoustic and

The following cut, "Cans and
Brahms,“ is where the trouble
arises. It features keyboardist
Richard Wakeman in extracts
from Brahms’ Fourth Symphony
in E Minor. On it he plays electric
and grand pianos. organ, electric
harpsichord, and synthesizer,
substituting for strings, wood-
winds. brass, reeds, and contra
bassoon.

Wakeman performs well and
displays remarkable technique.
Unfortunately, however, the track
is only a minute and 25 seconds,
and one might wonder how jus-
tice can possibly be done to
Brahms in so short a time inter-
val. Certainly Wakeman’s incred-
ible talents merit more time than

ed bya flimsy “personal idea" by
Jon Anderson, “We Have Heav-

Anderson overdubs all of the vo-
cal parts, which overlap in such a
way that it is difficult, if not im-
possible, to distinguish the w,ords.
although he repeats one basic line
37 times throughout the entire
song. -

The close of this track is accen-
tuated by what might be called
the "Iweird-voice technique,” rem- -
iniscent of the Beatles’ “I Am
and “Revolution

“South Side of the City,” which
closes the first side, features
Wakeman in his finest moment on
the entire album, as he performs
a Mozart-oriented piano solo.

Side two begins with a contri-
bution by Bill Buford, “Five Per
Cent for Nothing," which catches
the Yes violating the eighth com-

  

mandment. For the percussion
and organ parts and the bass

riffs seemingly have been stolen

from Emerson, Lake, and Pal-
mer’s “Eruption” on Tarkus.

Steve Howe shines during bril-
liant classical guitar solo called
“Mood for a Day,” reflecting
overtones of Andres Segovia. "’

The final cut on the album.
"Heart of the Sunrise,“ is per-
haps the most outstanding of the
arrangements. It features Ander-
son’s’ gentle vocalslbacked by the
typical Yes hard-rock accom-
paniment.

As if the listener hasn’t put up
with enough torture already, how-
ever. a brief reprise of "We Have
Heaven” has been attached to the
end of "Sunrise.” ’

Despite its deficiencies, Fragile

does contain 38 minutes of listen-

ing pleasure and is guaranteed to
fulfill the musical appetites of any
Yes enthusiast until the next Yes
release in about 12 months. .

dequacies

ance escaped his lips than the
setting shifts and upon the screen
a lisping eight-year-old prattles.
"Hello. I am Wanda June. Today
was going to be my birthday. but
I was hit by an ice—cream truck
before I could have my party. I
am dead now. I amin Heaven.”
Ha-has-ha-heh-he-er-ahem. We are
not amused.

Vonnegut’s Heaven is overflow-
ing with Ferris Wheels and Merry
Go Rounds, and everybody plays

‘ shuffleboard. Quips one resident,

“Jesus Christ in Heaven is just

another guy playing shuffle-
board.” '

Take that as you will. A smat-
tering of banality here. a dash of
irreverence there, slap, slap,
slap..{slap. The genuine sardonic
cracks are blunted by the awful 
excess of the opposite, as Von- 
negut continually undermines
rather than "underlines the intend-
ed message. Harold’s virility
hang-up is clumsily understated.

And the attempted shatteringof
the traditional heroic myth never
materializes.

The cinematic adaptation itself
is stagey and ill-wrought. An al-
ready unconvincing character-
ization of Harold is rendered un-
salvageable, while Steiger’s ad-
ditionally mediocre rendition ver-
ifies his degeneration as an actor.

The Jerry Lewis-ish Looseleaf

So take a deep breath, and form

Some of the East‘s top indoor tracksters will grace the Fitzgerald
Field House tomorrow as Pitt hosts its third annual Pittsburgh’ Invita-

tional.

“It will be one of the best meets we’ve held here." exclaimed Pitt's
track coach Jim Banner. "On Saturday we'll have the highest caliber of
competition in the three years that we‘ve held the meet." .

The Invitational is scheduled to begin at‘9 a.m. with trials and fin-

als in the field events—-—the pole
vault. 35-pound weight, long jump,

and shot put. At 10:30 a.m. trials.

f'or the running events will start,

with the finals slated to begin at '

1:30 p.m.

Sixteen teams will participate
in the Track Classic and Banner
anticipates the most rugged com-
petition to come from Navy, Bowl-
ing Green, Kentucky, West Vir-
ginia, Kent State, and Delaware. ,

The top talent is diffused
throughout the track and field
events and the Pitt squad mem-
bers can be counted among the
best in most every category.

Pitts Bill Rea will provide am-

ple competition in the long jump,

having jumped’24-8 indoor. Rea

will be challenged by Jim Camp- .

bell of Navy whose best ‘jump is
24-2.

Leading the competition in the
high jump is Navy’s Steve Hark-
in, whose best recorded jump is

6-10. Four other performers in
this event jumped 6-6 or better.
Bannermani Steve. Hein and
Navy’s Herb Hribar are the main
contenders in the shot put, both

having hurled the shot overT55-

feet. '

According to Banner, “Al Shot-
terman and Jacques Accambray
of Kent State will threaten the
'world‘s record here in the 35-
pound weight event.” Shotterman

Two months ago, prior to the :

Pitt-Michigan wrestling meet, As-
sistant Coach Dick Slutzky re-
marked that theﬁmatmen would
have six key bouts against the
. Wolverines, implying that a ma-
jority of the ten matches had to

_ be won for a team victory.

Nevertheless, the grapplers
spanked Clarion Wednesdaynight
at the Field ‘House, 21517, despite
only five Pitt triumphs, thanks to
pins by George Bryant (118) and

Kevin Love (150). Clarion is rank ,

ed third in the East. ‘

Avenging last .— year’s 30-5
pasting at the hands of the
Golden Eagles, the Panthers
jumped into a, 6-0 lead on Bry-
ant’s first period cradle. .

Stung by two previous losses to

Pitt, Clarion’s Dale Murdock‘ ral- I

lied from a 3-0 second period def-

 icit to upset Randy Payne, 11-6,’

and Accambray were number one
and two, respectively. in the

NCAA and the world mark they-

will be shooting for is 73-31,2 which
is held by the United States’
George Frenn.

Banner expects to find, it less

easy to repeat last year’s excel-

lent showing in the Invitational.

' Last season Pitt took the unoffi-

cial title in the Track Classic.

"It’s going to be more difficult

this time,” related the Pitt coach.

“The. competition is keener and ‘

we’ll have to be sharper to main-
tain'our good record.”

’ match. _ ‘

".‘The 134 pound bout was

The thunderous noise had abatedand the only sound remaining  "

the archaic edifice known as Alumni Memorial Gymnasium- Was. the

footfalls of, Coach Buzz-Ridl after his Panthers‘ 91

ette Leopards Wednesday night.

_ - The agony of the evening lingered on in the straihed

of the veteran coach’s face as he
triedto digest the fact that'Lafay-
ette had taken 41 foul shots (mak-
ing 31) while the cagers were only

entitled to 14. The humiliation is

not as great as the disgustand de-
jection of being cheated.

"If the other team shoots 41
foulshots and you 14 .you’re not
going to win,” -solemnly related
Ridl. ""You get near them and
they’re gonna call a foul.‘ Psycho-
logically you’re in a tough spot."

The Panthers,’ 8-7 on_ the sea-
son,. suffered tough -spots all eve-
niilg. and‘ were forced to ' play

-catch-up ball from the very outset

of the contest. The Cats never had
the lead in‘ the game, with the
closestgthey came being a 66-64
slate with about eight minutes re-
maining. 7 - ’ ‘
The story of the game was Lafay-
ette’s.»\ pressing defense and the
havoc it played with Pitt’s ball
control attack._ Rarely did the
Panthers have the time or the“
position to get the good shot. as
they settled for second best. Just
getting the ball up court was an
accomplishment.

At the other end of the court.
the Leopards maintained their ag-
gressiveness until the end. They
wasted very little time driving for
the basket or hitting the open man
underneath. Often the big men.
Walt,-Kocubinski or Joe Barkaus-
kas, would take the defensive re-
bound and throw the out pass to

either Jay Mottola or George’

Weaver who would reach the of-
fensive zone‘ before the Cats could
setup.

“Weaver had one of his. better
games of the year,” commented)
his coach Tom Davis after his

12th victory of the season. “I also ’

want to mention that I feel that
Mottola is'a really fine guard. I
think he’s really underrated. He
knows you have to look for the

hole and that’s what he did all

night.” ’ -

_co-captains“. had 18.points in the
contest "with team-mate_s Tracy .

far from‘ enough. Knight's 926

Panthers in the game, while Scott

half with some sharpshooting,-'-

about Knight. "He‘s a great play»-

say enough about him,”- com-ment- ,
ed Davis. “If people want to see a '

-potential superstar, there he is.

Hill has a bad temper which
flairs when he breaks a routine.

Pribis’ chances" against Hill lie
in his ability to be consistent. He
doesn’t gamble during a routine as
he emphasized, “Do what you
can and do it well and you will
never have any problems.’.’

Temple has beatenl some of the

best teams in the East this year,

defeating Syracuse, Navy, and
Springfield and has scored 153
points, some thirty points higher

“ than Pitt has reached any time

this year.

The Owls have strong depth
for all events, something Pitt has
lacked this season due to injur-
ies.

West Liberty, 61-41

Pitt’s women hoopsters romped over West Liberty Tuesday night
to win their first game of the season by a score of 61 - 41. High scor-

ers for Pitt were Rose Smith with 18

char with 16. '

West Liberty took an early lead
but Pitt managed to end the first
quarter with a three—point advan-
tage. By the end of thehalf, Pitt
had increased its lead with the
score 29-22.

The third quarter evidenced an- ’

other slight lead increase with

the score-Pitt 41 - West Liberty 1

31. However, in the fourth quar-
ter, Pitt tookcontrol of the ball
to sail to a 20-point victory.

Both teams used” a press and
“hustle” ywas the name of the
game. The result was an excep-
tionally high number of fouls
by both teams, Pitt with 21 and
West Liberty with 27.

Pitt’s coach Sandyl Bullman
explained why so many fouls
were made.

“Both teams consisted of young
girls who~are still somewhat in-

experienced, yet all the girls-

were really hustling, last night.
This resultedin a large number
of mistakes being made on the

  

1

points and Mary Ellen Klob-

court. And these mistakes caused
the fouls.”

Coach Bullman then added, .
"But even with the hard press on,-

our girls managed to shoot well.
I’m very pleased with the way
they played.” I “
