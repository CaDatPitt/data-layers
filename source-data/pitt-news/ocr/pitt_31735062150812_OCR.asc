Pitt News Again Anriounoes

The ﬁrst sign of spring ﬂoods the

It is pink and green, official
spring colors, and includes. a pic-

Draft Boards
Class Students

All college students enjoying
“blanket” deferment from compul-
sory military service be.‘ ore July 1
will be reclassiﬁed, draft boards
were ‘informed over the weekend.

From‘ national selective service
headquarters state draft directors
received" the instructions, “In re-
classifyihg students, all facts in the
possession of the local board at the
time of the student's classiﬁcation
in 1-D or 1-E should again. be given
full consideration, together with any
evidence of changed status which
may have occurred since classiﬁca-
tion.”

If a student is then found to be
in training or preparation for any
industry, business, agricultural pur-
suit, or governmental service neces-
sary to national health, safety, or in-
terest, he should be given occupa-
tional deferment, the deputy direc-
tor of the selective survice in-
structed.

“In determining whether or not a
student is a necessary man within
the- provision of the regulations,” it
was pointed’ out, “the“loc'al board
should give due consideration to
such factors as the length of time
in which the student has pursued
the course in question, his rela-
tive progress and standing in such
courses and his relative chances for
employment or placement in the ac-
tivity for which he is preparing.”

Of Suppression
Of Newspapers

Guild Man Says
‘Press Is Free’

Economic suppression of the
press in this country was pointed
out at the last meeting of Pitt
Town meeting by Charles L.
Whipple, resident organizer for
the American Newspaper guild
in the Pittsburgh area.

Former rewrite man for the Bos-
ton Globe, Whipple discussed
“Freedom of the Press” from the
point of View of the newspaper'-
man. He stated that in comparison
to totalitarian countries, the United
States has an undoubted freedom
of the press politically but not
economically.

Said Whipple, “In comparison to
totalitarian countries, we can agree
that the press of this country is
free, but although newspapers have

. a freedom of choice as to the po-

litical ‘party they wish to back,
they are subject, to a major extent,
to the pressure of the advertiser.”
Speciﬁc Cases

Whipple then went on to cite
speciﬁc cases wherein stories were
“slanted” to suit the interests of
certain advertisers.

Concerning future government
censorship of news by a central
committee whose duty it would be
to distribute government informa-
tion, Whipple stated that this is by
no means a remote possibility.”
War is no respecter of political
credos and we will see the label
Red applied and the people aroused
against unpopular causes,” ex-
plained Whipple. “Is complete cen-
sorship of news coming ‘to this
country?‘ The answer to this ques-
tion lies with the people.”

When asked to explain the last
statement, Whipple replied that the
people could ﬁnd out the real truth
in the news by reading certain pub-
lications that publish true accounts
of the stories in newspapers, by
learning to read in between the
lines "of new sto”ri"é*s,‘i‘ ‘aha ‘by""i\7v’rit-
ing letters to the editors of their
papers stating their opinions and
requesting unbiased and clear facts.
Labor Distrustful

Another point that Whipple
brought out in his discussion was
the relation of labor and the
presentation of its views in news
stories. He said that labor has be-
come distrustful
and.rather than send its own in-
formation to the newspapers, it
would permit a reporter,\who is
interested and sympathetic to. its
views and aims, to get the story for
himself. ‘ V C ‘

Citing a speciﬁc incident where
the side of labor had been miscon-
strued and “colored” by antagon-
istic factions, Whipple told of many
stories that came out of Washing-
ton following debates over the

As a result of the ASCAP-BMI

ization, has organized Allen Inter-
C011egi€1t€ Music, Inc., to handle all
college songs not ASCAP or BMI
copyrighted.

Allen is trying to make arrange-
ments to get the copyright privileges
for the Pitt Victory Song which was
publishedtseveral years‘ ago by the
University.

Radio rights were assigned to a
non-ASCAP organization, over a
year ago, Theodore W. Biddle, grad-
uate manager, stated, but this organ-
zation has not “pushed” the song,
and the University is considering
Allen’s offer to include the Victory
Song in the AIM catalogue.

The new Allen Intercol.legiate

rights to several important collegi-
ate songs including Harvard Victory
(the theme song of the Harvard
band), Fordham Ram, Roar Lion

Notre Dame, also songs of San Jose

Resigns Posts

In Alumni Association

Review Editor, Acting Secretafry
Leaves to Open Publicity Agency

Vacating the post which he has held since November 1939, Gene
Burkhart, ’36, resigned Monday evening as editor of the Alumni Review

and acting secretary of the General Alumni association.

The resigna-

tion, presented at the regular meeting of Alumni council, was accepted

and will become effective April 1.

Burkhart explairied his resignation in a statement to Harbaugli

Miller. president of the association,
in which he declared that he has
opened his own publicity and adver-
Llolllg agency which will take up
his time in the future.

The posts of alumni secretary and
editor have been subject to several
important changes during the past
two years.

Don Saunders, associated with
the University for 12 years, resign-
ed the post of secretary on April 1,
1939, explaining his seryices to the
association would no longer be of
value because “I have become in-
creasingly unsympathetic to some
policies of the University adminis-
tration which I believe to be detri-
mental to the best interests of the
school and of the alumni.”

Allison Went Second

Upon the resignation of Saund-
ers as secretary of the General
Alumni association, William Alli-
son, who was then editor of the
Alumni Review, took over the post
of acting secretary in addition to
his editorship. Saunders accepted
a position with the American Insti-
tute of Public Opinion and now is
with McCall’s magazine.

Allison’s resignation came in May
1939, just about one month after he
succeeded Saunders. He left to
take charge of publicity for the
Buhl planetarium. There was no
successor to the secretarial and ed-
itorial posts until October, 1939,
when Burkhart was appointed as
acting secretary and editor of the
alumni publication.

Assistant to Graham

After graduating from the Col-
lege, Burkhart was assistant to Rob-
ert X. Graham, director of the Uni-

versity News“service.'”Hew°was later» »-

associated with the Ford Motor
company and the First National
bank.

During his undergraduate days
he was an associate editor of the
Pitt News and Owl, editorial assist-
ant on the Panther, member of Cap
and Gown, Pitt Players, orchestra,
Glee club, and quartet.

It is not expected that asuccessor
to Burkloartwxvillw be appointed" in
the near future. Indications are
that the publication ..of the Alumni
Review will be suspended until a
new editor is selected by the Alumni
council.

A revision of WSGA’s constitu-
tion, requiring a 1.5 quality point
rating of all nominess for WSGA
ofﬁces, Senior court members, unit
advisers, and committee chairmen,
will be among the proposed changes
to be considered at the Friday mass
meeting.

The assembly is scheduled to take

ted for ratiﬁcation is the‘ proposal
that the chairman of the Housing
Board be included in the executive
committee.

The revisions were drawn up by
a committee chairmanned by Eliza-
beth Foster, C42, treasurer of
WSGA. They “represent a need
long-felt by the Woman’s Self Gov-
ernment association.” The resolu-
tions were passed by WSGA com-
mission last Thursday after several
weeks of work.

Ratiﬁcation of the proposals
must be by a vote of a two-thirds

‘majority of all women "attending 

the mass meeting.

Glory Finally Comes
To C. Stanton Belfour

THE NEWS that C. Stanton Belfour had
been elected national president of Omicron Delta
Kappa at the national convention in Baton
Rouge last week was welcome news, but we
must admit that it was not surprising.

University ODK men have been aware for
several years of the work that Belfour has done
for the national organization; they have also
known of the growing sentiment for his election

to the national presidency. Last year, there was
concrete evidence of the esteem in which he is
held when he was elected national vice-presi-
dent. ‘

Since the University ODK chapter is Gamma
circle, second chapter of an organization which

has grown to a position unsurpassed in national
importance by any group but Phi Beta Kappa
we think it ﬁtting that a Pitt man should head
’the national body.

We can think of no Pitt man more deserving
and better ﬁtted for the position than C. Stanton
'Belfour.

Congratulations, Stan. You earned them.

IVSGA Revises Rules

OUR SPIES TELL US that the Women’s Self
Government association is planning to amend its
constitution. This amending would make a 1.5
Jquality point average one requirement for all
WSGA council members, all members of Senior
court, all unit advisers, and all WSGA committee
chairmen.

0 {The announcement that WSGA. has found «

such ‘a move necessary is pretty disheartening.
.We’ve gone along for four years, respecting
WSGA council, respecting Senior court, respect-
ing unit advisers, respecting committee chair-
man.

We knew thatthey all were ﬁne, upstanding
girls, of unimpeachable character, and we sort
of ﬁgured that they were pretty good students,
toof “Now we learn that maybe some of those
girls we admired so much didn’t have a 1.5 aver-
age, that maybe they were just a little less than
the cream of their class.

knew‘ that WSGA often went around in circles,
but we thought that it went around in nothing
but the best circles.

Our’ attention has been attracted recently to the
Strange Case of. the Buried Paragraphs. The whole
bloody business is an example of malicious sedition,
iwhich we believe was created in the gruesome brains
,of_.;Gui1d_ «organizers on the staﬁ of the New York
Times.  I _

, ,For years we have nursed a habit of reading_head-
lines and last paragraphs of articles printed in the
American press. This is one of the best techniques
ever developed to trace the radicalism among news-
papermen, who write good headlines one day and un-
American last-paragraphs the next.

_  '

  

I nfamiliarity Breeds

.The case is just this: on March eleventh there was
printed a good constructive story called “O’Mahoney
Urges Economic Study,” a summary of a report by
the chairman of the Senate Temporary National Eco-
nomic committee. But the reporter who_sent that story
had no reason to include the following paragraph,
whichnot only is non-constructive, but which breeds
discontent at a time when we are striving so hard to
increase ‘revenue with which to ﬁnance the defense
program? ' 0
.':I"‘Mi'T.. O’Mahoney quoted from the many mono-
graphs prepared by and for the committee. They
showed that’ two of the nation’s largest corporations
wer'e’¥richer than all but 10 of the sovereign states;
that agriculture remains the sole industry still carried
omfor the most part by individuals; that great and
powerful business organizations are owned by a nu-
merically insigniﬁcant proportion of the total popula-
tion; that only one family out of every six pays an in-
come tax, and that of these income-taxpaying families
only 1/4 receive corporate dividends; that only a com-
paratively few corporations and h comparatively few
individuals are able to save.”

Another insigniﬁcant piece of malicious writing in
the New York Times was the last paragraph of a very
informative story called “TNEC Finds Stockholders of
U. S. Steel Bore Depression Impact More Than Labor.”
When efforts are being made to unify the popular effort
in the steel program for national defense, we see no
need for the last paragraph of that ﬁne story, showing
the sacriﬁces made by corporate stockholders which
read:

The Price Policy

“In. short, the price policy of the United States Steel
coitp>.ration, has been such, particularly in 1937-8, as
to take from the consumers more in exchange per unit
of output than in any previous year in the twenty-year
period here covered (1919-1938). Stated in another
way, despite all the phenomenal improvements’ in tech-
nology in the steel industry, the effort required by con-
sumers to get hold of a unit of steel is greater at the
end of this period than at any other time during the
-period.”-
We believe the reader should
against these seditious statements during the present
national emergency.

0 By E. Seymour Kerber

Maybe it’s because we’re not bohemian.

We have never submitted manuscripts to Quill club.
In fact, the only thing we ever did submit to was
the SatEvePost, and they sent us a beautiful little
note saying “your material was placed on ﬁle; if we
ever decide to run a story of this type we will com-
municate with you.”

As above said, we have never submitted to Quill.
This is repeated because we don’t want to be labelled
as frustrated. Our theme is: Quill club is going to
ﬁnd it rather difﬁcult to enforce their recently adopted
rules.

According to these new regulations an active mem-
ber must read, and have approved by a majority vote,
some of his own writing once every three meetings, or
else lose his membership until he again submits and
is accepted.

One Club, No Members

This is tantamount to eliminating membership in
Quill club, except for such alumni members who hap-
pen to have read and whose works have been approved
at one of the last three meetings of their undergradu-
ate careers. We say it is tantamount to eliminating
membership, as such, because it requires each mem-
ber to re-petition for membership “once every three
meetings.”

Of course Quill’s regulations are very clear. Quill’s
efforts are being devoted in e (:txi‘e(?!.«0n of consistent,
better writing, more worthy rosters, less politics in the
selection of members. To explain:

When a new applicant petitions for Quill member-
ship his work is read and voted upon without any
identiﬁcation of the author (Quill last year almost
turned down a Shakespeare sonnet). When a mem-
ber is reading under the new’ “every-three” rule this
anonymity ceases: a did-you-vote-for-me-well-I’1l-vote-
for-you attitude comes up.

One Club, No Entrance

Bad as this latter is, some parliamentarian slipped
even more, for Quill has not established a method for
the reinstatement of its “ex”-members; Quill members
are in doubt whether they will resubmit in the anony-
mous group or in the “coalition and collusion” classi-
ﬁcation. ,

We’ll admit Quill was trying to rectify an evil:
the admission of a mediocre writer upon submission
of a chance good opus. But has Quill succeeded in
solving this problem? Or will Quill ﬁnd that it is
banning the Margaret Mitchells, the other single-tome-
ists? And will Quill’s age-old policy of purity give
way to politics?

We don’t care. We were and are not going to sub-
mit to Quill. We are not literary. But we do hate
to see one of the few remaining nice-bunch-of-kids on
campus get into internal squabbles and strangle itself.

[Believing in getting both sides of the story, the
News has asked the president of Quill to speak out
to the charges of the writer of “Inbegrals.”]

0 By Oscar Sheﬂer, President of Quill club

To columnist Kerber, we offer our congratulations
upon his decision not to submit to Quill. We have read
his article and we feel that the decision should go

a down as one of the great humanitarian gestures of the

century.

To the editors of the Saturday Evening Post, we
oﬁer our praise of a well-developed literary taste.

To the reader who has read friend Kerber’s column,
we offer our condolences. Fiction has no place in the
expository essay.

Nibbling at the column paragraph by paragraph, we
ﬁnd that the enforcement of the new regulations “is
tantamount to eliminating membership,” because it re-
quires each member to re-petition for membership
once every three meetings. This, we feel, is inaccurate
reporting and would be unjust criticism if it were
accurate.‘  V

Rfequiremlents

Members of Quill are required to read at least once
every three, meetings. Quill meets every two weeks.
Anyone who cannot write a play, poem, essay, short
story_,'_or novel within the space of six weeks has no
place in Quill. When the member has read his work,

' the vote is taken as to whether he shall be rejected,

notes to whether he shall be kept in membership.
There is a difference. The victim is innocent until
proven guilty (of. Russian military trials). '

The aim of Quill club is to ‘promote and to stimu-
It is
not an honor society. Nor is it a social club.

There will be no reciprocal agreements among the
members. All votes will be cast by secret ballot. The
member oncevejected could not reciprocate, moreover,
if he did know who had voted against him.

tNo Flash Back

As for the chance opus, we think that there is no
such animal as the literary ﬂash—genius. A great por-
tion of excellence lies in consistency. We called the
shot on Kressman Taylor (Address Unknown) and
Pietro di Donato (Christ in Concrete), when we la-
belled them one-timers. Neither has written anything
ofnote since the ﬁrst eruptions. We have read Gone
With the Wind -and are happy at theopportunity to
eliminate potential Margaret Mitchel.ls. If comrade
Kerber knows of any, we will be only too glad for
the opportunity to indulge in mass bud-nippings.

On his ﬁrst submission, Bill Shakespeare was ac-
cepted last year by an unanimous vote of the club, is
still a non-dues-paying honorary in good standing.

Non-Fraternity Afternoon Classes Bring
Postponement of Meet

Pitt Junior Track Aces Reach New
Peaks in Butler Relays Competition

Since many of the boys on the track team have late classes on
\Vediiesday afternoons, coach Carl Olson decided to postpone this
afternoon ’s indoor championships until Saturday, April 5.

The meet, which was to begin at 4 o'clock. is the ninth annual

Swim Experts
Menace Greeks

With thepriiiiarzr hope of dethron-
ing the championship fraternity
swimming teams at the ﬁnals in
April, the Independents open the
elimination meets next Tuesday aft-
ernoon at 4:30 o’clock in the Trees
pool.

Optimism has been circulating
around independent circles this sea-
son, for only three of the prize-
winning swimmers will not be back.

Jackson, Mosko, and Notaro, out-
standing independent swimmers,
will deﬁnitely be competing against
the cream of the fraternity crop, and
should be considered their equals.

l\.’otaro won the 80-yard free style
race, took second place in the div-
ing contest, and was a member of
the 160-yard relay team.

Frank Mosko won a ﬁrst place in
the 60-yard medley race and a
ﬁrst place in the 40-yard breast-
stroke. Jackson ran away with the
ﬁeld in the diving contest, and was
a member of both the winning 80-
yard relay team and the title win-
ning l60—yard relay team.

Independents must take entry
blanks for the swimming meet to
James Potts, athletic director, at
least one day before the meet.

There will be seven events in the
meet: diving, 120-yard medley re-
lay, 100—yard free style, 40-yard free
style, 40-yard backstroke, 40-yard
breaststroke, and 80-yard relay. In
the diving events, the running front
dive, back dive, and front jack knife
dives are required. Then the con-
testant must perform any two op-
tional dives.

Penn State Alumni Club
Will Hear Dr. Farmer

D.. William R. Farmer, Univer-
sity chaplain, will speak on “Toler-
ance” at a meeting of the Penn
county in the Harvard-Yale-Prince-
ton club at noon Friday, announces
Alex E. Hunter, president of the
club.

Among those present at the meet-
ing will be Dr. Carl Schott, dean
of the school of physical education
and athletics at Penn State.

indoor championships.

The suggestion for deferment of the date

of competition met with approval from both the freshman and var-

sity athletes, since Old Man Win-
ter still hadn’t realized that spring
was supposedly just around the
corner.

With high school competition
already booked for Saturday after-
noon. March 22, and Saturday,
March 29, and no week nights ad-
visable, April 5 seemed the best
date.

Juniors Star

With no competition scheduled
for over two weeks, the chief topic
of conversation among track ath-
letes and fans is the work of Pitt’s
junior stars who competed in the
Butler relays last Saturday night.
Competing for the ﬁrst time this
year without his running mate,
Hap Stickel, Bullet Bill Carter-
raced to a successful title defense
in the 60-yard dash and tied a
world's record in the process.

In the trial heats, Carter clipped
off the fastest time he’s done yet
this year in tieing the Butler re-
lays dash iecord of 6.2 seconds. In
the ﬁnals, however, he was out of
his holes like a machine gun bullet,
sprinted to a new meet mark and
equalled the international ﬁgures.

Third Crown for Carter

Carter’s performance marked his
third title winning effort of the
season. He had previously won
the NYAC games title and the CTC
crown. In his ﬁrst meet of the
campaign he lost a doubtful deci-
sion to Harold Davis, the Califor-
nia sensation. Stickel beat him in
the Michigan dual meet, and he
ﬁnished third in the ICAAAA meet
behind Stickel and Barney Ewell.

Pitt’s other junior twins, Dusty
Rhoades and Red Jessup, the pole
vaulting duo, soared to a new high

in the pole vault, 13 feet eight
inches. Although they both went
higher then they ever did before,
the effort still only netted them a
tie for second place with their arch
rival, Decker of Michigan. The
winner, a Nebraska boy, leaped 13
feet 11 inches.

In eastern collegiate competition,
this mark would stand as the best
mark of the season. Inasmuch as
the Pitt outdoor record is 13 feet
71/; inches, it seems very likely
that this acrobatic pair will sur-
pass it.

Two of a Kind

When Rhoades and Jessup jump,
they help each other out up to 13
feet then they really forget all
friendship and team ties. With
them pushing each other all year,
it may be that the combination of
J essup and Rhoades will become as
famous as that of Meadows and
Sefton, the Southern California
pair who placed one-two in the 1936
Olympics. .

Joe Newman, the senior hurdler,
who turned in a great perform-
ance at South Bend, failed to qual-
ify for the ﬁnalsat Butler. ‘New-
man passed :his trials successfully,
but in’ the semi-ﬁnals. he hit the
last hurdle 'after "holding second
place behind Bob Wright, the«~sen-
sational Ohio State sophomore, and
wound up in fourth place.

Dance Group Asks
More Participation

There is still an opportunity for
all girls interested in the modern’
dance to join the group tau-ght by
Miss Gladys Ryland of the physical
education department.

Since the groupis still in the be-
ginning stages of organizing a
spring production, any woman stu-
dent, trained or untrained in the
modern dance, will be welcomed.

A completely equipped modern
dance studio has been opened on
th thirty—second floor of the Cathe-
dral for the use of the dance groups.

All girls interested should apply
to Miss Ryland immediately.

Wisconsin’s Badgers Oﬁer Toughest
Opposition to Panthers’ Title Chance

Q By ART REINSTEIN

For those unfortunates who like
to dabble in statistical debating,
we present a few salient ﬁgures on
Pitt’s basketball opponents to be.

First and probably least in the
line of hurdles to a Pittsburgh na-
tional championship is North Caro-
lina. The White Phantoms, best
team in the Southern conference,
ride entirely on the pitching abil-
ity of all-American center George
Glamack.

“Gorgeous George,” ﬁrst team se-
lection on the NEA and Collyer’s
Eye all-American outﬁts, tosses in
one-handed bank shots from either
side to roll up the points for North
Carolina.

The big Phantom team (forwards
Bob Rose and Hank Possar stretch
6 ft. 4 in.) plays a slow, deliberate
game, working set plays to score
from in close. Other Tarheel de-
pendables are: co-captain Jimmy
Howard, Bobby Gerstein, and Paul
Severin, all-American football star
and sixth‘ man on the basketball
squad.

The Phantoms won 14 out of 15
"i Southern conference play, but

   ‘A’

lost four out of ﬁve non—conference
games.

Probable second Pitt opponent is
Wisconsin, dark-horse champion of
the Big Ten. The Badgers dropped
a 36-34 decision to Pitt in the sea-
son’s opener, as Ed Straloski_ scored
19 points, but have come a long
way since then.

Proof of the great improvement
Coach Bud Foster has worked in
the Badgers is their record against
Minnesota this year. Big Gene
Englund and his mates bowed to
the Gophers, 44-27, in their ﬁrst
Big Ten clash. A few weeks ago
the Badgers smeared Minnesota
with a 42-32 defeat. At that rate
of improvement Wisconsin‘ must be
rated above Pitt in pre-tourney
guesses. ‘

Top man in the Badger’s drive
to their ﬁrst Big Ten basketball
championship in 23 years, was 6 ft.
4 in. center Gene Englund, second
highest scorer in the league, with
162 points in 12 games.

Other Wisconsin passers are
sophomore forward Johnny Kotz,
who averaged 10 points a game in
Big Ten competition, veterans
Charlie Epperson and Ted Strain,

and sophomore guard Charlie Rehm..

After losing to Pitt and Minne-
sota, the Badgeitsrwori .11 straight
marking their title drive‘ with a
victory over Indiana, last year’s
Big Ten and NCAA champion.

More very vital statistics: Wis-
consin won seventeen and lost
three, averaged 43.6 points per
game, and set a new Big Ten scor-
ing record of 536 points.

The team Pitt will probably .not

meet is Dartmouth, ﬁrst round op-—

ponent of Wisconsin. Four-time
Eastern Intercollegiate league cham-
pions, Coach Ossie Cowles’ men
broke their own league scoring
record this year by piling up a total
of 574 points in 12 games.
Captain Gus Broberg, scoring
champ of the _league with 164
points, is a great shot from all
angles, an excellent passer, and an
inspiring leader. Another big
Swede, sophomore center Jim
Olsen, took third place in league
scoring competition. Other tough
men on a big, hard-ﬁghting team
are forward George Munroe and
Guards Stub Pearson and Stan
Skaug. Pitt’s trip to Wisconsin
will certainly be no picnic jaunt.

ured that Stickel was still the top
man of the two, but now the argu-
ment is at a standstill. Coach_Carl
Olson isn’t unhappy that a differ-
ence of opinion exists over their
relative merits; he doesn’t ‘mind
having two of the best sprinters
that ever lived, on his track team.

Bullet Bill becomes the second
man in Pitt track history to ﬂirt
with world and not just national
marks. Immortal Long John Wood-
ruff played havoc with every record
from the 440 to the mile when he

Pilam Bowlers in Form,

Score Triumph in Playoffs

A new champion was crowned
last Monday, as the Pilams came
back to conquer both the Phi Kaps
and PiKA in the bowling play-oﬁs.

After losing the ﬁrst two games,
the ﬁrst to the Phi Kaps and the
second to PiKA, they regained their
form and won the next two and
the championship.

This fact was made possible by
the tournament rule which stated
that the ﬁrst team to win two
matches was to be crowned cham-
pions and the second team to win
two would take second place.

The Phi Kaps were the second
team to win two games and thus
they took second place, although the
Pi Kappa Alpha team had the high-
est amount of pins for the match.

High men for their respective
teams were: Ray Prushnok, Phi
Kappa, 178, Hershey Mattes, Pi
Lambda Phi, 171, and Dick Fair, Pi
Kappa Alpha, 167.

Members of the‘ ’41 champions
are: Burt Englesberg. Hershey Mat-
tes, Lenny Wolk, Norman Fineberg,
and Al Davidson.

The Phi Kaps team lead by Jack
Glenn, one of the most consistent
bowlers in the league includes: Bob
Tyberski, Ray Proshnow, Tom Mur-
phey, and Joe Connell.

Last year’s champions, but a
team which will have to be satisﬁed
with third place this year, are the
Pi Kappa Alpha keglers. Dick Fair,
Abe Williams, Lloyd Carlson, Chuck
Page, and Jim Klingensmith make
up this team.

This year’s champions had during
league competition broken the pre-
vious record for a ﬁve man team
with 823 to better the former mark
by three pins, but they almost lost
the title when PiKA came within

Bowser Hopes to Best Storm,

 rill Panther Squad Outdoors

Despite the snow storm that ush-
ered in the spring varsity football
drillslast Monday afternoon, Coach

.Charles Bowser held high hopes of

taking his squad outdoors for prac-
ticevthis week.
= Lack- _of sufficient outdoor prac-

.. tices hampered the Bowsermen last

year, and again seems to be the
chief headache of the coaching staff.

Indoor drills, which were held
in last Monday’s opening sessions,
are usually conﬁned to light work-
outs for stiff muscles. Poor facili-
ties underneath the stadium cut
-workouts to a minimum and also
takes its toll on attendance of play-

ersl
The appearance of last year’s
freshman squad of 39 lettermen,

varsity holdovers, and the junior
varsity team intact showed the
‘Panther coaches one of the largest
squads ever out for football.

Taking most of the spotlight this
spring will be these 39 freshmen,
who will be ﬁghting for the vacant
varsity posts.

Hitting the headlines in last sea-
son’s intra-squad games were: elu-
sive little Earl Ripple, halfback
from Windber; Marty Rosepink,
Verona High, end; Joe Broudy, bur-
ly guard from Peabody High; Fran-
cis Crytzer, Pittsburgh guard; Jim
Clawes, towering center from Pitts-
burgh; and Tarentum’s Dick Stitt.

These boys should see much serv-
ice this year, although their lack of
experience may hurt their chances.

Guard and tackle posts should be
the strongest units on the ﬁeld for
the Golden Panthers next fall.

Dr. Silverman Receives
Chemical Society Award

Class Authority
Accepts Aiiiiual
Bronze Plaque

llr. r\l€‘X&':ll~;lt‘-l‘ Silverman. pro-
fe.sso1* aiial lit-ad of tile t'll€‘llll;il.l'§'
(lt‘p'cll"[lll'.'ll‘.. lllT:’l‘ll‘i!ll()ll&ll au-
tliority on glass tecl11r1o1og_\', will
receive the 1940 l’ittslm1-g-I1
award of the American Chemical
society at a dinner meeting of the
society in the University club on
Thursday.

Established in 1932, the award is
presented for outstanding leader-

.ship in the ﬁeld of chemistry in

the Pittsburgh district. The recipi-
ent of the award must have con-
tributed notably to the advancement
of chemical knowledge, the promo-
tion of chemical industry, the bene-
ﬁtting of humanity, and the gen-
eral furthering of the aims of the
society.

Service to Education

The selection of Dr. Silverman
was made in recognition of his out-
standing service to the profession
of chemical education and for dis-
tinguished contributions to pure and
applied chemistry, especially in the

, ﬁelds of glass technology.

Dr. Silverman has been a mem-
ber of the University faculty for 36
years, 20 as department of chemis-
try head. In 1930, after completing
twenty-ﬁve years of service, Dr. Sil-
verman was presented with a por-
trait, executed by Ellis M. Silvette.
The picture now hangs: in Thaw
hall.

Recognized internationally as an
authority on glass, Dr. Silverman
has lectured and presented papers
extensively in the United States and
Europe. He has attended interna-
tional chemical meetings as a dele-
gate or councilor, representing the
national Academy of Sciences, the
National Research council, and the
American Ceramic society in Liege,
Belgium, in 1930; in Madrid, Spain,
in 1934; in Lucerne, Switzerland, in
1936; and in Rome, Italy, in 1938.

Twenty Patents

He is a fellow of the Society of
Glass Technology of England, the
American association for the ad-
vancement of science, and the Amer-
ican Ceramic society, of which he
has been chairman of the commit-
tee on honorary membership for
some years. Dr. Silverman has been
a member of the division of chemis-
try and chemical technology of the
National Research council for sev-
eral years and is chairman of its
committee on chemical data for cer-
amists.

The author of nearly one hun-
dred journal articles, several books,
he has over 20 patents to his credit.
He is well known for his collection
of modern glass, assembled over a
period of 36 years, and is said to be
the most representative from the
standpoint of art and technology of
anynin-the world today.

A sincere friend of his students,
his counsel and understanding have
come to the aid of many students in
ﬁnancial and personal distress. Un-
der his leadership_ the department

of chemistry has grown from a-fac-» -

ulty of three members and a stu-
dent body of approximately 100, to
a teaching staff of 30, many of
whom are outstanding leaders in
their respective ﬁelds, and a student
body of 1,500.
Plaque Designers

The award, a bronze plaque, the
joint creation of Frederic}; Fisher
Florig, designer, and Lois Whitcomb
Rhead, sculptor, both of Pittsburgh,
was adopted as the result of con-
test administered through a com-
mittee of the Associated Artists of
Pittsburgh in cooperation with a

committee of the American Chemic-

al society.

On February 15, 1934, the prize
for the design was presented to the
artists at a dinner at the University
club, and the ﬁrst Pittsburgh award
was made to Ralph Emmons Hall,
international authority on water
treatment.

In subsequent years the award
was made to Charles E. Nesbit,
chief chemist of the Carnegie Steel
company; the late Andrew W. Mel-
lon, and the late Richard B. Mel-
lon, donors of the Mellon institute
buildings; Francis C. Frary, direc-
tor of research of the Alumnium
Company of America; Dr. George H.
Clapp, president of the University’s
Board of Trustees, and Edward R.
Weidlein, director of Mellon insti-
tute.

Defense Committee Sets

Aims for Aid to Britain

The slogan “Deliver the goods to Britain now” is the new basic aim of
the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies, according to a
statement by the national policy board of the Committee which released
a new policy statement in New York and Pittsburgh yesterday. The new

policy WS drafted at a meeting at-
tended by representatives of all sec-
tions of the country, including
Frederick C. McKee, chairman of
the Pittsburgh branch, who rep-
resented the Pittsburgh chapter
and the chapter among students and
faculty at the University.

Five Main Points

Five main points make up the
new aims of the “aid to Britain”
group. They are:

1. The full mobilization of
American economic life for greater
production with whatever sacri-
ﬁces are necessary on the part of
business, labor, agriculture, and the
consumer.

2. Congressional revision of leg-

islation in order to permit the re- '
cruiting of Americans who wish to"

serve voluntarily in the armed or
civilian forces of those nations
whose defense is necessary for
American security.

3. Freezing of all foreign assets

' in the United States under the li-

cense system to prevent further
withdrawal of Axis balances and to
control Nazi activities in the west-
ern hemisphere.

4. A ﬁrm policy in the Paciﬁc.

5. Strenuous efforts to combat
Nazi and totalitarian propaganda in
the Americas with care to preserve
civil liberties and the Good Neigh-
bor policy.

,Faculty Advisers
Student representatives of the
‘group endorsed the new plan of the
gcommittee, which: seeks to put the
provision of the" recently passed
lend-lease bill into effect for in-
creasing aid to Britain. It was
pointed out that the action taken by
the United States at this time is as
im'portan't‘l as ‘the actual passage of
the measure.

Five University faculty members
serve as advisers to the student
group. They are: Dr. Charles S.
Tippetts, dean of the School" of
Business Administration; Dean E.
A. Holbrook of the School of En-
gineering and Mines; Dr. Francis D.
Tyson, professor or economics; Dr.
John W. Oliver, professor and head
of the department of history; and
Dr. Putnam F. Jones, associate pro-
fessor of English. The temporary
chairman of the student group is
William L. Klinkenstein, C42.

'IThe,_activiti‘es of the group at the
University, which has not applied
for or received oiﬁcial University
recognition, are directed along the
lines of mobilizing student senti-
ment behind the various phases of
the program of the national com-
mittee.

morial  a
violin. one of three in An1e:ica.

The original Maggini is the prize
possession of Leo I-lar.c:-3, C42, and
is reputedly worth :1 .(>i'.:uie. It
was built in Brescia, lt=.ily, in the
latter part of the sixteenth century
by Giovanni Paolo l\/laggini,
taught the teacher of Stradivarius.
The Harter family secured it in Paris
in 1800 through a professional
trader, Lengio Terﬁscio, whose rep-
utation was built upon acquiring
the violin.

The violin is only 16 inches long,
small enough for Leo to handle
when he was only six years old,
when he studied at the conservatory
at Geneva. The middle bouts have
a long graceful sweep, and the scroll
is carved in the feminine style
characteristic of Maggini’s violins.
Its label of authenticity is the pecu-
liar, sobbingnote of the G-string.

When Harter hands the violin to
Larry Morris, BA44, and reads his
line: “De mosta golden present I
geev heem tonight,” it will have
more than a little signiﬁcance, for

Players have insured the violin for

' $5,000. Leo and the $5,000 insuree
will arrive at the scene of the play
by street-car.

Guild M an

Continued from page one

Smith amendments to the Wagner
Labor act, how not one of these
stories had presented a fair and

accurate account of the position of

labor in the debates.

Whipple also made mention of
the present feud between West-
brook Pegler, newspaper columnist,
and the American Newspaper guild.
Pegler has accused the guild of be-
ing a communistic organization,
and to refute this accusation Whip-
ple stated that in a national refer-
endum of the guild, it was found
that they are no more communists
in the organization than in any
large governmental body in this
country.

Also to deny Pegler’s accusations,, , .

Whipple read several passages from
the gui1d’s constitution wherein it
is stated that membership in the
American Newspaper guild would
be denied to no one, regardless of
race, color, religion, or anything
that he writes in newspapers.

The reasons and results of the
recent strike on a local city paper
were explained to students and fac-
ulty members, and also the guild’s‘
part in the strike proceedings.

The latter part of» the discussion
was devoted to questions that stu-
dents asked Whipple concerning
various statements he had made in
the course of his talk.
