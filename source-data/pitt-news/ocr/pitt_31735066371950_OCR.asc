University of

Chipman seeks    

improved grades

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

Responding to his team’s quality
point average for last fall, Pitt has-
ketball coach Roy Chipman “did
not wait until panic time”to procure
an academic counselor for the
Panthers. .

Tom Price, in addition to the
three full-time Support Services
counselors, was hired specifically for
the basketball squad in January, one
month after last term’s 1.77 QPA.
Chipman said he attempted to
engage a fourth counselor last
spring, but his request was not ulti-
mately approved until the winter
term started.

“We’ve been ﬁghting for it for the

past year,” Chipman said. “I said
here’s what we needed, [athletic
director] Ed Bozik approved it, it
was sat on last summer, and three
weeks into the term, it was finally
implemented.

“We were aware of problems and
aware we were not getting the type of
support we needed, especially with
all of the traveling we’re doing.”

The team’s QPA, listed in a report
by the Senate Council’s athletics
subcommittee last- month, was the
lowest of all 15 varsity sports. Dis-
pleased with last fall’s results, Chip-
man disclosed‘ that his players’
overall average is “2.8 to 2.83.”

Dr. Toby Chapman, chairman of
the subcommittee, said his approval
of the additional hiring was one of
several. Yesterday a spokesman in
the provost’s office said Paul Yuna,
director of Support Services, likely
gave final approval. Yuna, however,
is reportedly out of town until
Monday. .

Despite the one-term showing
Chipman said the team’s seniors,
Chip Watkins, Andre Williams and
Charles Thompson, will all gradu-

ate; two of them, though, will enroll
for the spring term.

“I have to do everything I can to
get them to graduate,” Chipman
said. “I also believe we have to hire a
counselor to maintain that context.
Not that there's a malfunction, but
you need somebody to tutor, set up
study halls and so forth." ’

He added, “I’m not pleased with
the fact that we got a 1.77. Hopefully
the results this term will be a heck of

a lot better. From my standpoint, I,

think if we had an academic coordi-
nator [before January], the results
probably wouldn’t be that poor and
probably would be a hell of a lot
better.” -

Additionally, Chipman cast
doubt on results of a The Pitt News
survey that showed UCLA (2.5),
Texas A&M (2.40), Florida State
(2.0-2.5), Missouri (2.23) and Vir-
ginia (2.15) with higher results
through last fall. — -

“I'll guarantee you - unless I’m
greatly mistaken — that some of
those teams are not as high as is
stated,” Chipman said, “I could be
mistaken.”

Though the athletics subcommit-
tee’s report is completed on an
annual basis, Chapman said that
determination of individual eligibil-
ity will become a semi-annual pro-
cess. Ordinarily, all student-athletes’
eligibility is reviewed only in
August, but Chapman said another
review will begin “probably around
Christmas time,” primarily for those
competing during the winter.

“This exercise should have been
done before," said Chapman, a six-
year committee member who will
step down soon. This has been his
only year as chairman. ’

The basketball players, most of
whom are CAS and CGS students,
must maintain a 2.0 QPA along with
several respective course require-
ments to remain eligible. Otherwise,
the two schools’ deans can impose

‘probation and possible redshirting.

measles on other college cam-
puses around the country, the
Allegheny County Health
Department is urging local col-
lege students to make sure
they're immunized against the
disease.

“Although we have seen no
measles cases in the county so far
this year, the potential for an
outbreak exists because some
college students still are not pro-
tected,” warned Eleanor Streiff,
health department disease con-
trol chief.

“The immunity level among
children in kindergarten through
12th grade is 99 percent due to
the county’s mandatory immuni-
zation law. The level for college

students, who are not covered by
the law, is not known but is con-
sidered to be much lower.”

Health officials recommend
measles vaccine for college stu-
dents who were never immunized
or who were immunized before
their first birthday. Students
who have no record of immuni-
zation and are unsure whether
they received the vaccine should
also be immunized. A second
immunization would not be
harmful.

Measles shots are available
free of charge at county health
department district offices.
Immunization hours and office
locations can be obtained by call-
ing 578-8060.

Posvarshares thoughts on Pitt’s future

By Susan Benedek
The Pitt News

(Editor’s note: The following is an
interview with President Wesley
Posvar concerning reaction to the

‘final recommendations of the Five-

year Plan.)

Pitt News: Why does the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh need a planning
process now?

President Posvar: The planning
process is simply a discipline for set-
ting priorities, for looking at our
resources and deciding which pro-
grams merit expansion and which

Everyone, it seems, has an idea for
getting rich quick by building a bet-
ter mousetrap. The problem lies in
marketing the better mousetrap. A
relatively new, non-proﬁt corpora-
tion with links to both Carnegie-
Mellon University and the
University of Pittsburgh is deter-
mined to help Pittsburgh entrepre-
neurs start their own businesses and
keep them in business once they are
started.

So far, the Enterprise Corpora-
tion, which was founded last year,

can justifiably be diminished. That
sounds simple, but it’s not easy in a
university because it involves a lot of
people and it has to build upon con-
sensus. But it is also the key to
improving quality and prestige. We
have to strengthen ourselves if we
gare going to grow in purpose. I think
that few universities put themselves
through this type of evaluation.

PN: You used the term “streng—
then.” ‘Does this mean we're weak
now? '

Posvar: No. I think this is a uni-
versity that has developed all along.

" lt’s clear that we have reached the

eminence that people were dreaming
about 25 or 30 years ago. This is a
nationally prominent university. It
is one of the 20 or 30 best in the

neurs — some running small firms
already in existence and some just
thinking about starting their own
firm to market a product.

Jack Thorne, chairman and chief
executive officer of the Enterprise
Corporation, had been doing this on
an informal basis from his office as
adjunct professor at the Graduate
School of Industrial Administration
at CMU.

“I would help an entrepreneur if
they could get through to me on the
phone,” Thorne said. “But it got to
the point where I had to turn away
people because I just didn’t have the
time to teach and help people start
their own businesses. That’s when I
came up with the idea of the Enter-
prise Corporation."

country, and it is a world-class uni-
versity. We have a dozen depart-
ments and programs that are highly
prestigious.‘The university is a tre-
mendousasset of which the com-
munity should be proud.

PN: When was the Five- year Plan
conceived or formulated?

Posvar: The actual announce-
ment of participation started about
a year ago. Prior to that, we had
been talking about it for years. We
did develop a comprehensive univer-
sity plan about l0 years ago, and
then about five years ago another

‘version of it. This is just another

version, but this is the most tho-
rough version.

new businesses

The Enterprise Corporation is not
the sort of company where an inven-
tor can just walk in and magically
receive cash to start a business.
“Many entrepreneurs are unrealistic
about terms "in the financial com-
munity,” Thorne said. “We try to act
as a midwife in the birth of a new
company. We’ll give advice to both
the entrepreneur and the venture
capitalist as to what the market will
bear.”

What is provided to the person
with an idea is hands-on assistance
in structuring and organizing a busi-
ness. Typically, the individual must
put his idea on paper before it is
looked at by the Enterprise Corpo-
ration. This enables the three-person

staff to evaluate the venture’s poten-
tial. It also helps both the budding
businessman and a possible investor
to see if an idea is feasible and what
sort of marketing will be needed to
make the product successful. Should
the idea really take off, the entrepre-
neur will also need to know what
management structure will be neces-
sary and where to obtain advise on

tax, legal and accounting matters, as .

well as additional financing.
“There’s a big pipeline of entre-
preneurs," Thorne said. “lt’ll be at
least three years before we see
results. It takes a lot of work to get a

lntrapreneurship, as opposed to
entrepreneurship, occurs when a
manager stays within the conﬁnes of
a corporation to develop a better
way of producing a product for
market.

“Westinghouse is taking the lead,
sending Stan Abramson (an execu-
tive with Westinghouse) one day a
week to work with us in assisting
entrepreneurs. The corporations
look to learn from entrepreneurs,
because they run their businesses
very efficiently,” Thorne said.

There are no hourly fees for the
services the Enterprise Corporation
provides. If the organization devotes
much time and effort to a start-up
firm in the belief that it will mate-
rially add to the success of a venture,
it will request compensation based
on the success of the firm. The share
of the success will usually take the
form ofa small equity holding in the
company. At a future date, the
Enterprise Corporation hopes to be
self-supporting. Currently, the firm
has to rely on funding from founda-
tions to underwrite its operating
expenses. Pennsylvania’s Ben
Franklin Partnership has contrib-
uted $200,000 for fiscal 1984-1985,
and the Richard King Mellon Foun-
dation has donated over $1 million.
In addition, the Enterprise Corpora-

tion plans a fund-raising campaign ,

later this year.

“Our main goal is to give entrepre-
neurs credibility,” Thorne said. “We
want to make it easier for people to
start up businesses."

The Pitt connection

A university has many people
looking to break into the busi-
ness world once that elusive
bachelor’s degree is obtained.
But what happens in the real
world is a bit different from what
happens in the collegiate atmos-
phere. To help eliminate some of
the illusions, the University of
Pittsburgh established a class on
entrepreneurship and new ven-
ture initiation, which was funded
by the Enterprise Corporation.

The class is one of the ways the
Enterprise Corporation hopes to
“build bridges” to the academic
world. When plans forthe course
were drawn up, it was thought
that maybe 40 people would reg-
ister. Instead ll0 signed up -—
forcing Dennis Slevin, associate
professor of business administra-
tion in the Graduate School of
Business and teacher of the
course, to add a second section to
the class.

‘‘I’m amazed at the tremen-
dous diversity of students in the
class,” Slevin said. “Most people
are thinking they can’t plan on
spending a 40-year career in a
manufacturing company, so they -

come here to get the skills needed
to run their own business.”

At a recent class, students
presented business plans for sell-
ing everything from computer
software programs to pepper-
ﬂavored jelly.

“l’m gratified by the motiva-
tion of the students in the class,”
Slevin said. “You can’t teach
entrepreneuring the way you can
teach mathematics. What I try to
do is coach people to take a crea-
tive world view — a mindset that
says, ‘I can do it,’ ” Slevin
explained.

“The information in the course
is exactly what I needed,” said
Jaim Bailey, an MBA student.
Bailey is writing an integrated
telecommunications software
package for the Commodore 64
computer which he hopes to
market.

“I think the Enterprise Corpo-
ration is a valuable resource,” he
said. “They want to see you make
money.”

How
Can You

Worship
in Silence?

He entered the church and sat
in silence. In the encompassing
quiet, as the petty cares of the
day dropped away, he sought
to reach God directly. Another
seeker rose and spoke of love,
of human cruelty and injustice,
of Jesus, of other peacemakers,
of things she was deeply moved
to say out of her sense of com-
munion with God. His mind
enfolded the words, and in the
following reverential stillness
his thoughts cleared, his con-
victions strengthened, his un-
derstanding deepened.

And afterwords, everyone
shook hands.

There was no creed, no priest
or minister, no prearranged or-
der of service. Every Quaker

. meeting for worship is a quiet
search for the peace of mind to
hear the message of that still
small voice within.

Nursing school studies
problems of women

By Joelle Latine
The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh’s
School of Nursing not only educates
nurses, but also has a research
department that has been part of the
school for some time now.

According to Dr. June Abbey,
director of research for the School of
Nursing, the research department is
presently working on four major
studies involving the emotional and
physical problems of women.
Another study involves an improved
CPR Resuscie Annie.

Nursing research, according to
Abbey, has been granted $109,000
from the Nursing Research Empha-
sis Grant, which is supported by the
Department of Health and Human
Services.

One of the three women's studies
is aimed at discovering if breast
cancer occurs more in the left breast
than in the right. The research to
date has shown a statistically signifi-
cant tendency for one-sided breast
cancer in right-handers to develop
again on the same side before age 45.
A recurrence of the cancer is preva-
lent on the opposite side after the age
of 45.

The project is directed by Dr.
Susan Albrecht.

Because of the emotional needs of
many patients, nurses are in a posi-
tion to become personally involved
with patients. Two other studies
being conducted by the School of
Nursing will help equip nurses to
handle any emotional problems of
patients.

One project titled “Elderly Wid-
ows’ Responses to Bereavement,”
directed by Dr. Rose Constantino,
involves studying -elderly women
and testing for depression. The data
obtained from these tests will con-
tribute to the long-term objective of
the project, which is to develop
group sessions with the women.
These sessions, led by health profes-
sionals, will focus on alleviating
depression and loneliness, and
increasing socializing and identity
reconstruction for elderly widows.

Depression and psychological
problems in women are also the
focus of a second nursing school
study. The problems of executive
and military wives who are con-
stantly moving and relocating to
new areas are being studied in a pro-
ject directed by Dr. Kathryn Puskar.

Through psychological tests,
researchers are looking at the effects
a support group will have on these
wives. Because these wives are a
“high risk population,” according to
Abbey, the knowledge obtained will
contribute towards preventing any
psychiatric problems in these
women.

faculty and staff.

PN: Do you perceive a lack of
interest among the students con-
cerning the planning process?

Posvar: Well, I hope students are
mainly interested in their own stu-
dies. That‘s why they are here.

PN: You and Dr. Roger Benjamin
recently went on the air at WPTS,
and now you are doing this inter-
view. Are you attempting to inform
students and the university com-
munity about the recommenda
tions?

Posvar: I am simply responding to
expressed interest. I certainly
wouldn’t be going out andforcing
discussion on people if they didn't

ask us for it. I‘m glad that The Pitt
News and the radio station asked
me.

PN: How do you feel about
responses from the faculty about the
plan?

Posvar: That's a varied response.
The School of Education gave an
extremely thorough self-appraisal. I
think they have a sound plan, and I
think we have to help them carry out
that plan. Schools like engineering
are in the early stages. Concerning
the health sciences, we are looking
very seriously at moving physical
education into the School of Health
Related Professions. We are also
looking very seriously at merging
those programs that have common
provisional training for the clinical
services — that is, pharmacy, health

page 3 I" .0

professions and nursing -— into a
college of health sciences. We are
seeing a lot of support, and there is
some opposition.

PN: What about GSPIA?

Posvar: GSPIA is on a course
now which people seem to agree
should be reduced in size concerning
faculty and staff. The enrollment
and faculty size ratio has been differ-
ent from other professional schools.

There should also be more focus on . .

the idea that the programs of eco-
nomic and social development
should be combined with the
Department of International
Affairs. That's not doing away with
the programs; that’s bringing it
together with a related program. We
should probably be looking at fewer
objectives and more coordination
among those objectives in [GSPIA].

Posvar hosts art exhibit

By Lisa G. Gordon
The Pitt News

President Wesley Posvar hosted a
private art opening entitled “Samuel
Yellin, Metalworker" on March 29.
The show is now open to the public.

The turnout at the opening was
the largest the University of Pitts-
burgh Art Gallery has seen this year.
Despite the cold and rainy weather,
hundreds of people came to view the
metalwork.

The show, traveling through the
courtesy of the Gallery Association
of New York State, features iron
grates, grilles, candleholders, blue-
prints and furniture produced at
Yellin’s studio.

There is also a special exhibit of
local pieces on loan from various
campus buildings, President Pos-
var’s office and a private estate.

The pieces from the president's
office include fire dogs and a fire

screen. The screen is exquisite in
detail, with animal heads that
border the top of the screen. Each
animal is different; they were not
casted. Iron works such as this are
one of a kind and cannot be easily
imitated. Smithsonian Magazine
has referred to Yellin as “probably
the greatest metalworker of all
time.”

The university is fortunate to own
many of his pieces, which can be
seen at the Cathedral of Learning,
the Nationality Rooms, Heinz
Chapel and the Stephen Foster
Memorial. A map containing a
walking tour of these permanent
masterpieces on the campus can be
picked up at the gallery located in
the Frick Fine Arts Building.

Yellin’s son Harvey made a visit to
Pittsburgh to view the show and give
a lecture:

Yellin, who was born in a Polish
village in l885, began working with
metal at the age of seven. At II, he
was apprenticed to a Russian master
and became a master himself at the

young age of l7. In i905, he immi-
grated to the United States and went
to Phildelphia to enroll in the Phila-
delphia Museum School of Indus-
trial Arts. Within a year, he was
teaching at the school.

In 1909, Yellin opened his first
shop, and by l9ll he-had been com-
missioned to design and construct
the gates at the Long Island resi-
dence of J. P. Morgan.

During his life, he also did iron
work for the Federal Reserve Bank
in New York, the National Cathe-
dral in Washington and many col-
leges including Harvard, Yale,
Princeton, Bryn Mawr, Northwest-
ern,‘Oberlin and the University of
Pittsburgh.

The show will be in Pittsburgh
until April 28. Gallery hours are
Tuesday through Saturday, l0a.m.—
4 p.m.; Sunday, 2-5 p.m.; closed
Monday. Additional information
may be obtained by contacting
David Wilkins (director) or Mrea
Csorba (guest curator) at 624-4121.

New Hope

The threat of a heart attack is something that each of us
faces every day. Each year almost three-fourths of a
million Americans suffer heart attacks, and many who do
are often too far away from medical assistance to receive

help in time.

A new genetically engineered drug found to be nearly
twice as effective as the medication now used to halt heart
attacks has been developed by Genentech Inc., a biotech-
nology company in San Francisco. The experimental
drug seeks out and dissolves blood clots, which area
contributing factor to heart attacks.

The drug, tissue plasminogen activator, TPA was
tested against streptokinase, a compound already
licensed by the Food and Drug Administration for use in
treating blood clots in the heart. The study focused prin-
cipally on 214 patients with severely blocked coronary
arteries. Of those, 99 received TPA and 115 received
streptokinase. In 66 percent of patients given the new
substance, the blocked coronary arteries were re-opened,
compared with only 35 percent of those receiving

streptokinase.

Although the initial tests have been very positive, it is
not clear how soon the drug will become widely available.
More extensive testing must be undertaken to prove the
drug’s value in preventing heart attacks. After this, it
must pass Food and Drug Administration approval. This
process is likely to take several years.

According to everything that has been revealed thus
far, we believe that the Food and Drug Administration
should assist Genentech Inc. in any way it can to insure
that the drug be introduced into the market as rapidly as

possible.

While it is obvious that any drug should be carefully
scrutinized, it is just as logical that a drug of this import to
medicine should be put to use almost immediately.

  _L_ett_ers to the Editor

Good job

I would like to congratulate the
administration of the University of
Pittsburgh, and especially Dr. Pos-
var, for the recent coup in acquiring
the Harmarville Research Center
from the Chevron Corporation for
the Univeristy of Pittsburgh. I
believe that it is as important to con-
gratulate our administraion for
doing an excellent job as it it to cri-
ticize them for mistakes.

We all know the benefits to the
university and southwestern Penn-
sylvania that will accrue from this
accomplishment/encouragement of
businesses to stay in and relocate in
western Pennsylvania: initiation of
new enterprises in the area, increases
in employment and enhancement of
the reputation of the University of
Pittsburgh. These accomplishments
will work to better the reputation of
the entire university and will help to
counter the negative publicity and
criticism received (undeservedly) by
some elements in the administra-
tion. Fortunately, Dr. Posvar had

the-wisdom to modify the proposed
elimination of some very academic-
ally fine university schools, most
notably GSPIA, pharmacy, SHRP
and education.

Congratulations are in order for
Dr. Posvar and his negotiating team
for their fine work and for the bene-
fits to the entire University of Pitts-
burgh, southwestern Pennsylvania,
the state of Pennsylvania and our
alumni, students, faculty and staff.

Sanctimonious

Your March 29 edition contains a
letter to the editor from Dennis
Orvosh and a column by Bryan Lee.
I mean no disrespect to these gentle-
men, but I regret that both of them
choose to present their views in such
a patronizing manner.

Mr. Orvosh clouds his statement
with personal attacks on Ms. Burke

and concludes with the petty
demand to know, “What have you
done for charity lately?” Mr. Lee’s
condescending response to those
who disagree with him is, “Let's be
grown-ups here."

This sanctimonious remark has
the dubious distinction ofqualifying
as a “parting shot,” which of course
is what Mr. Lee promises to deliver
in his column. I would prefer to read
something thought-provoking as
opposed to merely provoking.

As a faithful reader of The Pitt
News, I have been frequently
exposed to snide name-calling in the
guise of reasoned commentary
about everything from abortion,
Louis Farrakhan and President
Reagan, to the quality ofthis news-
paper and of the football team. To
help me and your other readers
avoid confusion in the future, could
you please print this material separ-
ately, perhaps under the heading
“Cheap Shots”?

The executive look self-help program

You know, I hate springtime.
Don't get me wrong ~ I like the
warm weather, the blooming flow-
ers, the green grass, and so on. How-
ever, when spring arrives I must shed
my bulky sweaters and heavy coat.

You see, beneath all that clothing
is a somewhat protruding belly. It
drapes over my belt. In other words,
I have become fat over the winter.

This problem prompted me to
seek out something — anything —
that might permanently suck that
roll of blubber back into my waist.
Oh, and I'm really tired of holding it
in.

I asked around for advice and got
the same old story - diet and exer-
cise, my two worst enemies. I guess
you could say I love to eat, butl hate
to inflict pain upon my body.-But
what could I do?'That was the only
answer.

Health clubs were just too expen-
sive for me, and those faddish crash
diets left me with painful withdrawal
symptoms. I need food. So it was off
to the Campus Book Store for my
health needs.

The possibilities for exercise were
endless. I was completely amazed,
perhaps amused. Three long shelves
of books .0ffe_rcd,to shape me_ upgi

minutes‘, hours and, well, years. (I
avoided those.) Each book focused
on a different facet of life — young,
old and  the executive?

I picked up “The Executive
Look," but it dawned on me that I
was only a student. Besides, the only
true way to acquire the executive
look is to spend at least 25 years
behind a large wooden desk barking
out orders and making piles of
money. I really don’t think I need a
book to tell me that.

The “High-Tech Fitness” book
frightened me from the beginning.
You see, I hate computers. The exer-
cise equipment in the book looked
like machines in “Star Wars”! guess
I’m just too simple for that.

“Rock Aerobics“ caught my eye
for a moment. That seemed to be the
“in"direction to go. I could danceto
popular music and lose weight at the
same time. That seemed great, but
there's one problem: I don’t have a
vast record collection to draw from
for each workout. I guess I could
dance to the radio, but I can't quite
get the rhythm of those
commericials.

If I were in the military, the

."Rqy_al Canadian Air... Force. Exer-
.A.J...I. at £3 O‘¢~#»cl.~J ‘AJ&‘J»1&

cise” book might have interested me.
I must admit that the cover photo of
the man and woman fully dressed in
uniform running toward the photo-
grapher did impress me. The U.S.
Army issued a similar book which
offered equal inspiration.

I’m not coordinated enough to
perform the exercises presented in a
Chinese martial arts workout book.
And I really wasn't into “pushing
nine oxen," “parting a horse’s mane
to the left (or right)” and other sym-
bolic gestures.

Then, of course, there were the
multitudes of books by shapely
movie stars such as Raquel Welch
and Jane Fonda. How can I respect
Jane when she has someone else
pose for every exercise position in
the book? Should I assume thatshe
can’t do it herself? .

Bodybuilding books were out of
the question. I was going to have to
deal with reality. Let‘s face it —
blood, sweat and tears is not for me.

Perhaps Ishould just accept the
new me. Look at all the other Ameri-
cans who are fat. I’m certainly not
alone. Besides, don’t you think daily
salads and frequent 200-yard dashes

Flogging a dead horse

by Leslie M. Bennett

Sylvester is the type of movie that
makes you laugh —-— not necessarily
because it's funny, but more likely
because it's ridiculous. Though it's
meant to be a warm, human story of a
courageous young girl and her horse,
no matter how you try, it's tough to
take a horse named Sylvester
seriously. .

In all fairness, a film as upbeat and
American—pie as this shouldn't come
as a surprise to anyone. It fits, or
almost fits, right in with the slew of
baseball, cotton-picking and other
"home of the brave” sort of movies

that have appeared in the past year.
They're films that appeal to our heart
and soul, and they encourageour dig-
nity and morality.

The thing about Sylvester is that it's
far too obliging, beyond the point of
romanticism and almost to the point
of condescending melodrama.

The film, written by Carol Sobieski
and directed by Tim Hunter, portrays
a spunky 16-year-old Texan tomboy
named Charlie (short for Charlene,
of course) who earns a hard living
breaking horses in a stockyard to sup-
port and raise her two kid brothers.
In her determination to fulfill her
responsibilities and to realize her
dreams of training competitive

Olympic horses, Charlie feels threat-
ened from all sides. I

It's not surprising to see Melissa
Gilbert in the role of Charlie, with

her own little house on the prairie —
or little mobile home, as it were.

What's surprising is to hear phrases

like "shove it up your ass" coming
from an actress who will long be

remembered as ”Half-pint." It's fit-

ting that a girl who isn't expected to
be all grown up is playing a girl who
isn't expected .to be all grown up
either.

Sylvester never fails to offer an awful

lot to look at. It's got the big blue skies
and rolling hills of southwest Texas,
complete with goatsand kicked-up
dust. It's got the majestic white-
fenced countryside of eastern Ken-

tucky horse farms.
What the film doesn't give us is
someone or something to care about.

Even Richard Farnsworth, the tried
and true western hero, doesn't have
much to offer in the role of Foster,
the stubborn, drunken but compas-
sionate father figure to Charlie.
Instead, his script is filled with silly
words of wisdom, which quickly
become cliche. "You can't clip an
eagle's wings and put him in the hen-
house," says Foster.

Somewhere in the background,
Michael Schoeffling has the role of
Charlie's understanding and some-
times jealous suitor. His character is
actually a relief because it is relatively
unassuming and out of the way. He
just pumps gas and waits for all this
horse nonsense to resolve itself so
that he and Charlie can settle down
and" live happily ever after.

And in the end, to shatter any
doubts, that's just about what
happens.

Yankton Hatten, Shane Serwin and Melissa Gilbert star in Sylvester.

’'I don't think the film was
made to make money," said
Melissa Gilbert at a recent press
conference about Sylvester, the
movie in which she makes her
motionbpicture debut.

Well  it probably won't.

But it seems that anyone who
had appeared in more than 30
commercials at the age of nine,
and who starred in an enor-
mously popular TV series that
ran for almost 10 years, and had
leading roles in five critically
acclaimed movies for television
(one of which earned an Emmy
nomination), and who even
owns her own production com-
pany ought to have a little bet-
ter insight on the economics of
the entertainment industry.

"I'm not a business person at
all," she admits. Looking at the
freckles, barrettes, false finger-
nails and sheer cuteness that
this 20-year-old displays, who
can expect her to be? After‘ all,
she's an actress, and that's really
all that matters ‘to »-her _—
because she's having so much
fun.

"lt's such a wonderful profes-
sion to be in. It's so creative,"
she says. ”I enjoy watching
myself. I'm having such a wond-
erful time."

Sylvester has certainly been fun
for Gilbert, if not for most
movie—goers. She's full of anec-
dotes about Texas cowboys,
Kentucky snobs and chewing
tobacco. And though she real-
izes that some audiences might
not enjoy it, she's very positive

Home on the range

about the story and particularly
about her role as Charlie.
”Charlie was not a difficult
character for me to play," she
says. "I didn't have to step away
I from myself to find Charlie. But
at the same time, it was very
different. The strength and
belief that Charlie had that she
could do anything to prove to
people that what she thought
was right, that she could train
horses, that she could get over
her parents’ death, that she
could raise the boys — that's a
lot of self-confidence for a 16-
year-old. Me at I6, I wasn't any-
thing like that. I wasn't
responsible for anything except
my schoolwork and my car."
But like Charlie, Gilbert is
still trying to deal with what
people expect from her and
what they don't expect from
her. When asked whether she
was uncomfortable with some
of the less-than-fami_ly-
oriented language in the script,
her response is quick—witted
and to the point: ”Hell, no!"
So it seems that Gilbert feels
ready for more. With plans of
studying acting and possibly
even doing stage performances,
her primary goals are, under-
standably, to grow. ”I want to
play so many different kinds of
people," she says. "So far, I've
been repeating myself."
Considering the actress’ age
and resources, we can expect to
see more of her — but hopefully
not more of the same. '

' Woody deﬂowered

.___._..__page Y.  

by Carrie Stetler

Like many Woody Allen movies,
The Purple Rose of Cairo begins with a
bittersweet premise. Set during the
Great Depression, it revolves around
a clumsy, lonely waitress, Celia
(played by Mia Farrow), who tries to
escape her abuse-filled marriage and
drab surroundings by going to the
movies (alone, of course). As you may
already know, the Hollywood films of
the '30s constrasted sharply with the
economic hardships of the period.
While average Americans wore dark,
moth-eaten clothing and starved in
breadlines, their matinee idols flick-
ered across the screen, arrayed in
silver and white, dancing in ball-
rooms and drinking champagne.

Thus are we prepared for deep
irony and twinges of pathos when a
suddenly jobless Celia is sucked into
the local theater to see — for the
fourth time that week — a roman-
'ce/adventure/musical entitled "The
Purple Rose of Cairo.” As she sits
there transfixed in the darkness, one
of the movie's dashing lead charac-
ters leaves the screen to stand in
front of her and declare his love for
her. Together they run out of the
theater and into a series of events
meant to blur and define the distinc-
tion between fiction and reality, actor
and character, screenwriter and God,
etc. The minor characters remaining
on screen are left stranded” in their

fictitious living room, and soon they
begin arguing with their audience.
The actor who played the runaway

—film character is summoned from

Hollywood to try to find his creation.

Although most of the scenes in Pur-
ple Rose are clever and a few quite
funny, the central joke begins to wear
a little thin. The sad whimsicality of
the film is not as touching — or as
comic — as the pathos of Allen's last
two efforts, Zelig and Broadway Danny
Rose. The film seems to want to be a
bit of a tear—jerker, but it's not affect-
ing enough for that. Why, for
instance, is Allen sympathetic to yet
detached from Celia's.marriage prob-
lems? Her husband cheats on her,
beats her and ends up excusing him-
self with lines like ”I drink. Iget crazy.
It's not me; it's the whiskey." Celia's
husband seems neither funny nor
particularly horrible — he's just sort
of there, flatly occupying space. Yet
we know he is a major source of
Celia's misery. We're constantly
bombarded with close-ups of her
looking heartwrenched, defiant or
trapped. Somehow, there doesn't
seem to be enough contrast between
Celia's reality and Celia's fantasy.
When we are made aware of the sepa-
ration or unity between fiction and
reality, it is usually through didactic
or woodenly clever lines like "Don't
turn the projector off. It gets black
and we disappear."

The movie is also hampered by nos-

 

‘Ea

Purple Rose of Cairo.

talgic sentimentality. The shabby
New Iersy shanties near Celia look
cozy. When Celia's misadventures
have ended painfully and unsurpris-
ingly, we see her watching a Fred
Astaire and Ginger Rogers movie, a
shot which, while a little overbearing,
says more than most of the movie's
droll dialogue about cinematic
illusion.

Woody Allen does not appear in The
Purple Rose, apparently because Mia
Farrow is now able to enact a femi-
nine version of his unhappy, dream-
ing schlemiel (and probably because
she is now able to stammer and apol-
ogize just like him, a strange afflic-
tion to which most of Allen's
showcased actresses fall victim). The
film's many supporting characters
are all good. Particularly funny are

ilo O'Shea, Deborh Rus, John Wood and Edward Herrmann in The

Deborah Rush as a nasally Harlowe-
esque floozy who stars in "The Pur-
ple Rose of Cairo" within The Purple
Rose of Cairo. Jeff Daniels gives a
smooth performance as both the fic-
tional and ”real life" actor who is
charming/idealistic, impulsive/self-
absorbed. The little old ladylfrom th_e
Fruit of the Loom commercial makes
a cute cameo appearance playing the
piano when Celia, in a fit of abandon,
plays the ukelele.

The Purple Rose of Cairo is a charming,
occasionally funny film with a good
early swing soundtrack and some
tricky editing, much like the "docu-
mentary" portions of Zelig. In other
words, it's a disappointment for
Woody Allen fans who have better
things to do than "get" jokes and
admire a stylish, winsome surface.

The Power Station
Capitol/EMI

This is not a band. It's a sound.

Consider: A pair of Duran-
nies get a creative itch to do
something without their glam-
boy frontman Simon LeBon.
They want to express themselves.
They enlist Robert Palmer, the
unsung hero of white Brit-soul
who can sing anything and
make it sound intimate and
urgent. They sign on Tony
Thompson and Bernard
Edwards, drummer and the pro-
ducer (respectively) of Chic and
name the unit after the studio
where it was recorded.

Very apt emphasis here. This
is an exercise of record engi-
neering far more than musi-
cianship or, God forbid,

compositional skills. This record
will make your stereo turn
somersaults and jump through
a hoop. The jagged, angular
lines that make up the album's
cover design could be a meta-
phor for its sound: a lot of dis-
jointed, shard-like pieces
colliding in a vacuum — very
appealing in a stylish, modern
way. Like having the latest hair-
cut, you can toss this around
and feel very cool, very sexy.

The single "Some Like It Hot"
is, I confess, irresistible. The
drums, which sound big and
hollow, have been scrupulously
set apart from the rest of the
mix. Everything else is rhythm
—— from the staccato delivery of
the lyric to the terse guitar and
horn chart. The song is like
being bitten by a snake with
fangs so sharp that you don't
feel it or care.

/\

/\

\ .»\\ \/

\/\.»’

Although this is a.good start,
the rest of the record is mostly
forgettable rock fodder with the
same mix. It gets irritating.
Even though I would be happy
listening to Palmer sing anything,
the Power Station's treatment
of the T. Rex classic "Bang a
Gong” comes off all flash, no
feeling. There's a lazy, humid,
sexy quality to the original that
these boys lost. Palmer's voice is
husky and close-miked —-— that's
just fine, but the rhythm guitar
is in your face throughout the
song and does nothing to war-
rant the attention.

Palmer's writing skills shine
through the arrangement on
"Go to Zero," which carries a
cheery negativism: I do this and I
do that and when it's cold I weara hat/
It pays to advertise they say, I'll keep
my hat on anyway/ Or so I'm told.

This music is very stylish and
might be a good purchase for
the summertime. Buy the single

back and forth from songs that
portray the tenuousness of rela-
tionships in both the personal
and political realm to keen
observations of ordinary
circumstances.

It says here that the unions will
never learn, Billy laments on "It

Says Here," which opens the '

disc in his thick Paul Weller—like
British accent. The song reads
like a down-and-outer perusing
a newspaper full of bad news.
On the other hand, a raunchy-
sounding rave-up, "From a Vaux-
hall Velox," sends Billy almost
out of control recalling the dar-
ing one-man recklessness of
Bob Dylan's "From a Buick Six"
from nearly 20 years ago.

The two approaches are wed
perfectly on the two songs that
provide Billy with instrumental
accompaniment. "The Saturday

head's crisp trumpet interlude,

Blue Note brings jazz legends back to life

(continued from the from cover)

It isn't often that a record label is
born of pure, unadulterated passion,
but in 1925, when 16-year-old Alfred
Lion first heard the soulful and emo-
tional music of Sam Wooding’s
orchestra fill a Berlin dance hall, hot
jazz had won perhaps its most ardent
fan and avid promoter. Lion's love for
and fascination with jazz music ulti-
mately led to the founding of the Blue
Note label in January of 1939, finally
ensuring that the general public
would be privy to the music that had
changed his life. «

Through the years, Alfred Lion
and his friend and partner Frank
Wolff were responsible for bringing

I the best in current jazz to vinyl, help-
-ing artists like Sonny Rollins, Can-
‘nonbaH

Adderley, Stanley

Turrentine and Fats Navarro to make
record store inventory sheets for the
first time. From those days to the

-present, Blue Note’s well-rehearsed

"and carefully engineered sound has
remained in constant demand. It was
and still isunmistakable.

  

Columbia Records president Bruce
Lundvall, after being approached
with the idea by CapitoI/EMI-
America, accepted the task of resusci-
tating the classic sound by making
Blue Note a branch of his new Man-
hattan label. With the able assistance
of archivist Michael Cuscuna (who
was placed in charge of the re-issue
program), Lundvall carefully sifted
through the Blue Note vaults and
chose for release an initial group of 21
original classics, four newly disco-
vered catalog treasures and an auspi-
ciously titled two-record compilation,
The Best of Blue Note.

To preserve a sense of nostalgia, all
of the re-issues sport paper-on-board
jackets with their initial artwork,
making certain to maintain the sensi-
tive and atmospheric qualities_of the
Rudy Van Gelder originals. In addi-
tion to these attractive visual aes-
thetics, the recordings have
undergone rigorous reprocessing -
digital remastering, direct metal and
audiophile pressings — to guarantee

 

In keeping with tradition, former

the best possible audio fidelity. The
albums are also available on high-
quality XDR cassettes and in compact
disc format.

In the '50s and '60s, Blue Note
dominated the American jazz scene.

Even competitive labels such as Pres- _

tige Records admittedly could not
match the care in preparation or
packaging of Blue Note. Due to the
greater financial resources of its
owners or perhaps their superior
enthusiasm (or both), the market, as
it stood, was pretty much theirs.
Given Blue Note’s healthy attitude
with which they approached their
sessions and the freedom for experi-
mentation afforded their artists, Blue
Note produced some of the most con-
sistently adventurous music of the

‘ day.

Whether or not the flame still
burns for Blue Note is anyone’s
guess. If the positive responses from
Europe and Japan (perennially active
jazz markets) are any indication, the
prognosis is good. Nevertheless,
without the loving hands of Messrs.
Lion and Wolff, the label may find
itself hanging by its fingertips above
the viper pit of the music industry.
But to Bruce Lundvall, a confessed
Blue Note fanatic from its inception,
instilling the characteristic passion is

about as easy as talking baseball with -

Mel Allen. The greenback marketing
aspects may, however, prove _to be a
cliff of a larger stature. For now, at
least, integrity is still the root to cling
to.

Blue N ote records are designed simply to serve
the uncompromising expressions of hot jazz or
swing, in general. A ny particular style of playing
which represents an authentic way of musical feel-
ing is genuine expression. By virtue of its signifi-
cance in place, time and circumstance, it possesses
its own tradition, artistic standards and audience
that keeps it alive. Hot jazz, therefore, is expres-
sion and communication, a musical social mani-
festation, and Blue Note records are concerned
with identifying its impulse, not its sensational
and commercial adornments.

Does Ewing tie “precision”

By Jim Urban
The Pitt News

During this period of little sports
action, there is not much to do but
think, so here are some thoughts.

I don’t know ifit isjust me, but did
the CBS coverage of Monday night’s
NCAA ﬁnal seem biased? It got to
the point where if Patrick Ewing
would have.tied his shoe, I think
Billy Packer would have said some-
thing like, “Look at the knot Patrick
tied in his shoe. Is that a precision
knot or what? That‘s why Patrick is
the premier’ player in the nation

’ today."

No fooling folks, I’m serious.

Here are some more of Packer’s
quotes that he actually said on the
air. Commenting on Ewing after he

 Sports,        R 

knotsin his shoes?

grabbed a rebound off a Villanova
fast break, “Here's Patrick Ewing,
all seven feet of him, running the
entire nine feet to grab that
rebound.”

Is Packer implying that Ewing
usually doesn’t hustle or is he trying
to say that Patrick should play the
offensive end of the floor?

In another Packer quote, he com-
mented on the exchange between
Georgetown’s Reggie Williams and
Villanova’s Chuck Everson at the
end of the first half when no foul was
called, “That was a good no-call.”

Come on, Billy! Where is Al
McGuire when we need him?

Speaking of which, I wonder if
McGuire still thinks that the ACC is
tougher than the Big East. With
Georgetown’s victory over Georgia
Tech, St. John’s’win over North

Viewpoint

Carolina State and Villanova‘s wins
over both Maryland and North
Carolina, McGuire’s argument suf-
fered a severe blow.

Getting back to the final, the CBS
camera angles showed just exactly
how Georgetown operates. The best
shot of the night had to be the one
showing Hoya guard Horace Broad-
nax tackling Harold Pressley of Vil-
lanova as Broadnax attempted to
take a charge.

It’s weird ~— before the game, you
see Patrick Ewing tell America’s
youth not to drink or take drugs.

Then you see Williams take ashot at
Everson and Broadnax tackle Press-
ley, who was hurt on the play.

Dirty play such as that is not good
publicity for the Hoyas, nor is it a
good example for America’s youth.
For some reason, I have a feeling
that if I go watch a junior high
school basketball game next year,
I’m going to see kids pulling each
other down as they mimic their
heroes. We shall seejust what type of
effect television has on kids.

On the lighter side of things, for
those of you who didn’t get to see
Jerome Lane in the Roundball Clas-
sic Tuesday night, you have a treat
coming next year. Lane was not
spectacular, the way Junie Lewis
was in last year’s game, but Lane was
fundamentally sound.

Lane, one of Roy Chipman’s top

 

page 13

recruits, will give an added dimen-
sion to the Panther attack next year.
Lane did the little things — boxing
out well, hitting the open man, etc.
Perhaps the thing that impressed me
most was when Lane, in a sprint
down the court on a fast break,
caught a bounce pass at his ankles,

took one dribble and one step and,

dunked the ball — all without slow-
ing down or hesitating. Lane will be
an asset in breaking a pressure
defense.

One ﬁnal thought: A member of
the Pitt rugby team, which is no
longer affiliated with the university
after an incident a while back, asked
me why the rugby team was aban-
doned by the university, but the
football team is not, even though
they have caused some trouble.

The answer? Money changes
everything!

Chaz Pal1a/ The Pitt News

Murray smooth in class, on field

I By Teresa Varley
For The Pitt News

The first time that University of
Pittsburgh baseball coach Bobby
Lewis saw Joe Murray field a
ground ball, he knew he had found
something special.

Murray,- a senior from Plains, Pa.,
has the knack for coming up with
almost any play, no matter how dif-
ficult. That is why he got the nick-
name “Smooth."

“Joe comes justifiably by his
name,” Lewis said. “He is a very
smooth ﬁelder. Mechanically, he
does everything right.”

So far this season, doing every-
thing right has meant batting .278
and making plays as the starting
third baseman that often stopped
sure hits. While his defensive play
needs little work, Murray would like
to improve his hitting.

“I would like to stay above .300,"
Murray said. “The competition we
are up against this year in the Big
East is a lot better and more intense,
but I would like to stay around that

mark. I want the whole team to do
well and for us to be the Big East
champs.”

Being the Big East champs would
mean having to beat powerful teams
such as Seton Hall, Georgetown and
Villanova, but with players li-ke
Murray around, the Panthers have
more of a [chance at the title.

Murray finished last season with a
.339 batting average. He had 19 hits
with three doubles and knocked in
II runs.

Although Murray does work hard
on improving his play, it seems that
baseball is in his blood.

His father Gerald played minor
league baseball in Canada, his older
brother Gerry played for three years
in the New York-Pennsylvania
minor league, and his uncle Joe
played for the Philadelphia
Athletics.

Murray played baseball at
Coughlin High School where he was
a three-year letterman. In his senior
year his team finished second to
Shaler High School in the state
championships, where two of his
current teammates, Ed Bodnar and
Matt Stennett, played.

He spent time at Saddleback
(Cal.) Community College and Lu-
zerne Community College before he
decided to transfer to Pitt.

“The main reason I decided to
come to Pitt was for the physical
therapy program,” Murray said. “I
also wanted to play Division I
baseball.”

Murray, who was admitted to
Pitt's physical therapy program, is
also smooth in the classroom. Since
coming to Pitt, he has maintained
above a 3.6 QPA. He was named to
the Athletic Director's Highest
Honor Roll, and his name has also
appeared on the dean’s list numer-
ous times. Last year he was honored
by being named honorable mention
Academic All-America.

“That has been one of the high-
lights since I have been here," Mur-
ray said. “I was really pleased sincel
was honored for both sports and
academics. I hope to do even better
this year.

“I really like it here. The coaches
have been great. I get along with
them well. Everybody is really
friendly." .

Pitt Football Notes

Four of the first five Pitt opponents this year were ranked
among last year’s ﬁnal Top 20 teams. Ohio State (l3th -
Associated Press; l2th — United Press International), Boston
College (fourth — UPI; ﬁfth — AP), West Virginia (18th -
UPI) and South Carolina (1 1th — AP; 13th —-— UPI) all made
the grade. The other school, Purdue, went 7-5, including an
appearance in the Peach Bowl.

#*##¥##***

Pitt’s senior quarterback John Congemi is currently in fifth
place among all-time Panther passers with 3,042 career yards.
Matt Cavanaugh is fourth with 3,378 yards. I_f Congemi con-
tinues on his current pace, he will surpass Rick Trocano‘s
second-place ﬁgure of 4,219 yards. Dan Marino, the top-
ranked Pitt quarterback of all time, has 8,597 career passing

*####*###I

The top three Panther tacklers from last year -— Troy Ben-
son, Caesar Aldisert and Chris Doleman —— have graduated.
For the second consecutive year, Benson led the team ( l 68 total
tackles). The top returning tackler is senior strong safety Bill
Callahan. He was the No. 4 man lastyear with 65 knockdowns.

A look back:

When TV was the new kid

Ever wonder what The Pitt
News’ Sports pages used to look
like? Say I0, 20 or 30 years ago?
Wonder no more 

On April I3, 1955, The Pitt
News returned from its spring
hiatus.
sports editor Dave Mazer wrote
a column entitled “Colleges Dish
Out TV Gravy.”

“In the past, officials of
athletically-minded colleges
worried over problems of sche-
duling, getting new facilities,
recruiting and the such, but
today’s athletic director has an
additional grey-hair producer —
television.

‘‘It was concerning this latest
problem that I dropped in on
Captain Tom Hamilton Monday

_afternoon to get a better under-

standing of what the National
Collegiate Athletic Association
has finally decided to do with this
coming year’s programming.
“Hamilton, a member of the
NCAA’s television board,
explained that TV has affected
sports in general quite largely,
but only in the colleges and uni-
versities has there been any retal-
iation, that is, in the controlling

In that issue, former‘

I

or restricting oftelevision.

‘‘It is a known fact that the
sports have either compensated
for it by various methods or have
fallen into the mad scramble for
the big money involved in it. Cer-
tainly, the colleges deserve credit
for trying to deal with television
in a manner suitable to the col-
leges ...”

Mazer explained the intrica-
cies of the NCAA’s plan for tele-
vising collegiate football games,
including the fact that no school
may appear on TV more than
twice in one season, barring sell-
outs, playoffs and other specific
situations. This rule was just
changed last season. Mazer
concluded:

“Well, any way you look at it,
the whole NCAA scheme is a
move to give more schools a
chance to get a part of the TV
gravy, and this is a step in the
right direction.”

CORRECTION

It was incorrectly reported in
the April 3 issue of The Pitt News
that Tico Copper, a 6-9 center
from Allegheny Community
College who has committed to
play basketball at Pitt, would sit
out next season because of rules
regarding transfers.

The paragraph should have
read that Cooper would sit out
next season by his own choice.
Junior college transfers are not
forced by NCAA rules to sit out a
year before they become eligible.
