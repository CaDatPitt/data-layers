If the host of high school stu-
dents who crowded ‘(lie balconies
of Memorial Hall }.<"rid-a,v morning,
and swarmed over the campus
walks and all available floors
of the Cathedral for the rest of
the weekend, aren’t sold on the
idea of coming to college, it won’t be
the fault of the lnterschol2:stic com-
1!1lf.l’.(-‘,8.

And if there was anything about the
Spring Festival activitie-s that. wasn’t
quite up to snuff, it went. entirely un-
noticed by the 3,000 high school boys
and girls who received ever_v‘..!1ing

make Interscholastic day a perma-
nent part of the Festival schedule,
.'.:.C(fOI'CllI1Q.‘ to Leslie \Vilkins. C35, chair-
man of the Intersclioéastic aftail‘.

Following an afternoon ﬁlled with
a float. parade, an ROTC review and
fraternity sweepstakes, the visitors
wandered around the campus grounds
until the big event of the two-clay pro-
gram}, Varsity night, got under way
in Carnegie Music Hall at 9 o’clock.

Hcadlining the events on the pro-
gram conducted by James Boyle, C35,
were a talk by Dr. John Bain Suther-
land, head football coach, a frater-
nity sing, several selections by a trom-
bone trio, and the presenting of the
Spring Festival awards.

Delta Zeta Has Best Float

Delta Zeta fraternity was announc-
ed as the winner of‘the annual -wo-
men's ﬂoat parade with their clever
presentation of a Chinese theme. Kap-
pa Kappa Gamma, holding to a Scot-
tish theme in its ﬂoat, was awarded
second prize. The Alpha Epsilon Phi
1.,-'roup’s Lithuanian ﬂoat was accord-
Ml honorable mention.

The University band and the ROTC
group came in for a plaque for their
line services during the Festival day
parade.

The winners of the f1'ate_ri_iity_
,sweep~stakes were announced as Kap-
pa Sigma, first, and Delta Tau Delta,
second.

'l‘hriving'on competition, the Greeks
went at it for the second time in
21 day as they staged an lnterfrater-
nity sing for the scholastic visitors.
Running true to form, the Delta. Tau
Delta. house took the honors in the
.-ougfest, with Pi Kappa. Alpha and
Phi Gamma Delta coming in for hon-
nruble mention.

The major event on the Saturday
program was the 28th running of the
luterscholastic track and ﬁeld meet
at, the stadium. Scott high, of Tole-
do. last year’s champions, scored a
repeat victory with a total of -14
points.

Altoona high was a close second.
with 37 1-3 points, while the remain-
der of the 15 schools which broke in-
so the scoring columns were strung
out well behind. More than 600 schol-
ustic atheltes competed in the 15
events on the program.

We All Over Then

After that it was all over. Back
went the schoolgirls and schoolboys
m the home town to tell those who
1-emained behind just what it was all
about and to reveal whatever there
is to reveal about looking out of a
36th ﬂoor window.

visitors can be thankful to the numer-

League Of Women Voters, Alumni To Sponsor
Opening Performarices; Viehman Directs

.-‘\ltllougl1 fl 9 lientucky _Der.b_v passed into history again Satur-
day. all file glamor of that great turf event will be revived in part
at the Nixon theater tonight as the Cap and Gown club presents the
premiere }leri'ormanee of “in the Soup.”

‘Witli cast, choruses, octette and specialties rehearsed 1'igl1t down
to finest points by Theodore \'jol:1.n1a11, director of the show, and Gene
Kelly, (lain.-lug clii-ector, the musical come.(l_v is all set to show before

the League of Women Voters.
organizatioil is sponsoring the open-
ing night performa11<:e and the alumni
a1‘e«,spouso1'lng tomorrow nigl1t’s event.

Tlgle story of the show is based upon
the invention of a. new kind of al-
phabet soup by a gentleman named,
oddly enough, Alpha Bert. Albert Barr.
C37. will play the part of Bett. and
Jack \Vyeth, 35, will be his socially-
climbing wife.

The girl who causes most of the
heart interest in the show is Bett’s
daughter, June. played by Russell Con-
nolly, C36. And the fellow who takes
the hcro’s role as an enterprising
young lawyer, named Brian, is Alfred
Knauss, C35. ‘

The production, the twenty-eighth
of the Cap and Gown club, is laid for
the most. part in southern settings and
features everythirlg from colonels,
dyed-in-the-wool and oth.erwlse, to
race track tours and jockeys. 

Music for the production has been
written by Gus A. Scllnabel, Dr. Ben-
jamin Levant, John M. St. Peter and
Herbert Cohen, C?-.8. Lyrics were con-
tributed lly Schnabel, Fushan, G. Nor-
man Reis, Jack Allen and Harold
Romm, C37.

Several specialty numbers have been
added to the program, according" to
Viehman. Fred Kelly, C37, is sched-
uled for two song and dance num-
bers, one of which will be executed
on roller skates. Joseph Samson,
magician of the 1932 show, will re-
appear in a similar role; and will add
a tap dance number to the program.

A trio, consisting of W'illiam Berg.
Jack Keller and Sherman Pasekoff
has also been added to the original
cast of characters and will be heard
in. one number. .  ,. . .

The show ‘will contain three acts,
with one scene in the ﬁrst and second
acts and two scenes in act three. In
all, 20 musical numbers will find their
way into the script of the show.

Several of the new tunes wliich are
being booked as pre-show ‘favorites are
“Let me dance into your heart,” “Time
for me,” “I like the simple things,”
“I wants be alone with you.” and “I
ain't foolin’ and it ain’t no lie.”

The last-named song is the only stu-
dent-written composition appearing in

‘Panner’ Appears,
Razzes Leaders

John Tibby, Horse Lover, George
Roll, Pacifist, Take Rides

The Pitt Panner, revived Razz Rag,
appeared again at the Spring Festival
dance, Saturday night, with a leading
story, “Faculty goes on strike, or may-
be it’s students,” or something to that
effect.

Taking jabs at such campus lumin-
aries as Joe Stodgers, chairman of the
Junior Prom, “the most successful in
history,” Major John Tebay, famous
style designer, editor of The Pitt
News, and lover of horses, and George
Roll, president of ODK, and militant
paciﬁst,‘ the Panner ﬁlled four pages
with assorted headlines and unassort-
ed pictures. ,

Somewhere in the paper was a. story
about the ODK tapping which never
took place, all because the members
had taken an oath of secrecy about
new tappees, and had forgotten to set
a time limit to the oath. Elsewhere
were stories of Leonard Mark's vaca-
tion trip—-occasioned by heavy busi-
ness in the senior - announcements
game, and about Joseph Madden’s
brawl with Soho gangsters who had
offended his sensibility when he be-
gan to re_ad a. poem about the daffy-
dils.

Parodies of Herrymon Maurer’s col-
umn, Alan I.loyd’s remarks, and Ed-
win Bank’s observations were also in-
cluded. Somehow the headlines over
each were tied up with Dartmouth col-
lege, even though the connection was
not always clear.

The lead editorial featured a scath-
ing attack on Rupert Brooke's poetry,
and also presented a varied list of
telephone numbers.

Forum To Hear Lecture
On Ii/Iusical Stimulation

If you ﬁnd yourself breathing more
deeply at the strains of the “Blue
Danube” waltz or panting furiously
after a chorus of “Lookie, lookie,
lookie_ Here comes cookie.” you may
ﬁnd an explanation for those reac-
tions this afternoon at the Psychology
forum.

Using classical and jazz music as
examples, Miss Jean Patterson Mor-
ton, graduate student in the depart-
ment of psychology. will present a
study, “Some psychological accom-
paniments of musical stimulation.”

The forum will meet at 4:30 o'clock
this afternoon in Room 308, Alumni
hall.

the show. The music for the num-
ber was written by Herbert Cohen,
C38, while the lyrics were supplied by
Harold Romm, C37, :1. transfer from
the University of Pennsylvania. Romm
also appears in the cast of the show
as “Sher Locke.”

Briefly, the synopsis of tile play al-
lows Alpha Bett, the fellow who in-
vents the soup, to run the gauntlet of
his ambitions to become a. Kentucky
colonel. The arrival into the picture
of a publicity agent, played by John
I-laker, C38, sends the {llI1ll‘llLl()llS into
‘nigh-gear as the entire company
moves on to Louisville.

What happens when they get there
and come into contact with Governor
Schmalz, played by Joseph Madden,
C36, and a couple of Colonels ﬁlls out
the action for the second act.

The third act brings the whole
troupe to a cafe near the race track at
Louisville on Derby Day, and from
there on the plot rushes to a swift con-
clusion in a second scene at the same
spot" in the evening.

Scenery for “In the Soup” has been
constructed by a technical staff made
up of Pitt Players scenery staffs.
This marks the first time that all the
sets for a Cap and Gown show have
been designed and constructed by stu-
dents. Jack Robson, C36, is in charge
of the various committees on the sets.

The show is being billed as “a
three-act extravaganza of mirth, mer-
riment and monkey-shines below the
1\‘Ia.son and Dixon line.” And judging
from the cast which has been hard
at work for almost two months, and
from the G. Norman Reis libretto
which  said to" be the best of the
nine which that gentleman has con-
tributed to Cap and Gown, it may be
that the show will live up to every
bit of its billing.

The show will run every night this
week. with only evening performances
scheduled. The Cap and Gown ticket
exchange will continue this afternoon,
tomorrow and VVednesda.y from 2 to
4 o’clock in Room 801, Cathedral. Ad-
missions may be bought there from
9 to 5 o’clock each day.

Final Assembly
Meeting Planned

Newly Elected Body To Meet
Jointly With Old Group

A week from tomorrow evening, the
ﬁnal SFA meeting of the year is
planned. The retiring Assembly and
the incoming organization will con-
vene jointly at that time.

A report of the past two semesters’
activity will be made by Leonard
Marks, C35, chairman of the Executive
committee. Internal election of a
new executive board will then take
place.

Soon after the new steering group-
is se1ect.ed——probably the next day——
a. special meeting will include choice
of oﬁﬁcers for 1935-36. With the new
heads named, the organization will
immediately begin work on the two
problems which continue into next
year, the preparation of a social cal-
endar and a broadened course of
freshman orientation.

Dr. John G. Bowman, Chancellor, is
expected to announce names of new
faculty Assembly members within the
next week. The selection will com-
plete the roster of the governing
unit.

Although 3. recount of the ballots
for J. Edgar Spitz and Walter Hart
had shown a. serious error in addition,
Marks indicated Friday that there
will be no general re-tallying of bal-
lots. It is rumored, however, that a
movement for a complete review of
the election results is being sponsored
by disorganized groups on campus.
The change in the Hart-Spitz totals is
said to be responsible for the senti-
ment.

Six New Delta‘ Sigma Rho
Members To Visit W. &J.

“Resolved, that six new members
shall be initiated into Delta Sigma
Rho.” This is the latest question to
be considered by 12 campus debaters,
who will leave tomorrow afternoon for
a conference of Delta Sigma. Rho, na-
tional honorary forensic fraternity, at
VVashington and Jefferson college.

The conference, besides the initia-
tion of tappees, will involve a sym-
posium on: “Is Fascism the way out'?”

University students to be initiated
are: John Torrence, C35, Edwin
Banks, C35, Vvinston McConkey, C35,
Frank Doeringer, C35, Betty Glass,
Ed36, and Sarah Reish, C36.

Change Carnival
Date Once Again

Heads Meet Today To Decide
On New Date For Affairs

 

There won’t be any carnival at the
stadium VVednesday afternoon, as was
announced Friday by Robert Willison,
BA35, and Marjorie Reich, C35, co-
chairmen of Spring Festival events.

All the carnival activties which
will be going on up there that day

‘will be supplied by Coach Carl Ol-

son's freshman traok athletes, who
have a big meet on.

‘Thus the carnival, which previ-
ously suffered a postponement due
to the great portions of rain which
fell last Thursday, is given a second
setback. .

Just when those campus organiza-
tions which have been racking their
brains for ideas on booths are going to
get a chance to display the result
of their efforts will be de”t.ermined to-
day at a meeting of the Spring Fes-
tival heads.

The annual Interfrateruity track
and field meet, which this year is to
be opened to non-fraternit_v men as
well, is likewise wiped oil’ W'eo'nes-
day’s schedule.

Miss Reich could not state yester-
day any deﬁnite date for the third at-
tempt to stage the carnival.“ The
whole affair would be threshed out in
a committee meeting today, she add-
ed. In all probability, Thursday will
likely be set aside as carnival day,
Miss Reich prophesied.

In that event, the booths, women’s
sports events, interfraternity track
meet. lemonade, pop-corn and all the
carnival trimmings will come off just
one week later than the original date.
After all-, a carnival is still a. carnival
and the added time for preparation
shouldn’t do a bit of harm.

“And it will still be colossal,” stated
Miss Reich.

 

Amateurs Given
Chance In Public
Speech Contest

 

A contest in original, persuasive pub-
lic speaking will be held. beginning
May 15, according to Miss Theresa
Kahn, instructor in English.

Open to any University student, the
contest requires only that the speech
be convincingly original and no more
than eight minutes long. Any subject
may be selected for this address.

James Boyle, C35, won the contest
last year with a speech on “Paciﬁsm.”-
He urges wide participation and his

advice to the entrants is that the
selection of controversial subjects
would offer the best chance of win-

ning.

Prizes will be awarded to both the
winner and runner-up. Preliminary try-
outs will be held in Room 2220, Alumni
hall, on May 15 at 2:30 o’clock.

Judges in the contest will be Dr.
W. M. Parrish, professor of public
speaking, Carl B. Cass, assistant pro-
fessor of English, Richard Murphy, in-
structor in English, and Miss Kahn.

Museum Curator Speaks
To Collembolae Wednesday

Dr. Stanley Brooks, curator of re-
cent invertebrates at Carnegie Mu-
seum, will be the speaker at the
monthly meeting of Collembolae, hon-
orary natural science fraternity, Thurs-
day an 8 o’clock. His lecture will be
illustrated with slides. The subject is
“Crossing Newfoundland in 1934.”

At the meeting Thursday, members
will be given their last opportunity to
pay their annual dues, without which
payment no one will be permitted to
vote at the following meeting in May.

Himstead Appears
At State Probe,
Cites His Report

Chairman of AAUP Committee,
Dr. Tippetts, Dr. Hallock
Testify At Sessions

More Students Speak

Another weck—end ineeiing of
the State Im'estiga.t1ng commit-
tec closed Saturday after testi-
mony had been offered by Dr.
(‘harles S. '.l‘ippet.ts, dean of the
School of Business Administra-
tion, Dr. John \V. Hallock, secre-
tary of the General Alumni Asso-
(".ldi-.lO]1, and Dr. Ralpll E. Him-
stead, professor of law at Syra-
cuse un.ivers‘it._v and chairman of
the AAUP investigating commit-
tee.

“At our next session, we plan to
call Dr. ’1"_vson, Dr. McKay, Dr. Gab-
bert, and perhaps several other pro-
fessors whose names have been
been brought up at our hearings. it
is-likely, too, that from ten to 20 stu-
dents may be called,” said Chairman
Eugene A. Caputo of the legislative
investigating committee at the con-
clusion of the Saturday session.

Dr. Tippetts told the committee that
academic freedom at the University
does exist, and that there is no fear
and uncertainty among‘ the faculty.

“I have differed with the Chan-
cellor many times, and in many cases
he has graciously yielded,” he said.

“In regard to the sentiment about
the work of new men on the faculty,
Lhere is a general feeling that young-
er men should prepare for a. life of
scholarship and should keep out of
outside activities."

In cross-examination §Dr. Tippetts

maintained that the AAUP report
was very one-sided. “Many faculty
members,” he declared, “are of a

thoroughly liberal type in the Univer-
sity faculty, and are never interfered
with.”
Cites University Advantages

The Business A.dministra.tion head
pointed out that three factors inﬂu-
enced his coming to the University.
The first was the mere ten per cent cut
in salary, as con1p_ared with 25 per
cent cuts in other universities, the sys-
tem of annuities for faculty members,
and the group life insurance plan
which make the life of faculty mem-
bcrs more secure and happier.

There are 26,000 graduates and 40,-
000 former students of the University,
Dr. Hallock brought out in his testi-
mony.

He reviewed the work of the Gener-
al Alumni Association, and showed
that its income from the University
itself had dropped aproximately $4,000
in the past year.

“The desired relationship between
the administration and the staff is
one of partnership,” said Dr. Him-
stead, when questioned regarding the
attitude of the AAUP.

“The national officials said that Dr.
Bowman is not the type of man with
whom we could make an adjustment,”
he continued. “Therefore we felt it
necessary to have our committee carry
on an investigation here. We had con-
ferences with 75 men on the faculty,
and there is no blinking at the fact
that the tenure situation is unsatisfac-
tory.”

What Is University?

“VVe have no desire to injure Pitt,
because if we injure Pitt we injure
every member of the staff. The Uni-
versity consists not only of adminis-
tration members, but every member
of the teaching staff as well. If we made
public the list of faculty members with
whom we talked,” the Syracuse pro-
fessor asserted, “there would without
doubt be some professors on the re-
lief rolls next year.”

“Dr. Bowman has a. contemptous
,attitude toward teachers generally,”
said Dr. Himstead. “Of course, this
opinion is rather widespread. M.ost
college professors usually need inter-
pretation to the public.”

“In the teaching of controversial
subjects. susceptibilities are stepped
on. Teachers therefore need secur-
ity.”

“If the professor has to watch his
step, it tends to make him timid. This
is the direct antithesis of good teach-
ing.” declared the Witness.

“If a man has continuously taught
in e. university for seven, eight or nine
years, we have the feeling that he
should not be removed without due
process of law.” maintained the AAUP
witness.

“we grant you that,” said State In-
vestigator Zappal;-1.

“\Ve do not say that Dr, Bowman
suppresses academic freedom.” de-
clared Dr. Himstead. “We say that
the environment here is not conducive
to academic freedom.”

The visiting professor discounted
religous reasons for Dr. Turner’s dis-
missal, and declared that Dean L. P.
Sieg of the College had told him con-
ﬁdentially that religion had practically
nothing to do with the removal of
the histdry teacher.

A succes-sion of students including
Sarah Reish, C36, Albert Brandon, C36,
Eleanor Brankstone, G, and Katherine
Monori, C36, told the investigators
that -Dr. Turner had told no risque
stories in class, had not hurt their re-

That’s the feeling up on the
ﬂoor of the Cathedral just now.
It seems Governor Ruby 'Laffoon of

Kentucky doesn't appoint as many
Kentucky Colonels as they say he
does.

Following is what this whole thing
is about, a. copy of the telegram sent.
Governor Laffoon:

“Pitt's show this year is based
around three Kentucky Colonels.
Students who will play these parts
are Alfred J. Barr, William J. Ruhe
and Joseph Madden. Will you be
willing to appoint these students
Kentucky Colonels, said appoint-
ment to hold good until after the

ligious belief and had never offended
their sensibilities. Miss Monori said
further that when, last week, she had
attempted to get Judge Musmanno to
speak before the Inquiry forum, ad-
visers of the forum had told her that
other speakers, using other topics,
might be more acceptable, and that it
would be indiscreet to have the
Judge appear only a. short time after
he had testified against the University.

Lester Pearl, E37, member of the
National Student league, charged
suppression of student opinion. at the
April 12 anti-war assembly. and as-
serted that the National Student
league had been unable to obtain a
charter on the campus during the
past year.

During a. four—‘nour cross-ex:-1inina—
tion Friday afternoon, Dr. Bowman
upheld the method he used in dis1niss-
ing Dr. Turner for tho ousted pro-
fessor's alleged “scoffing attitude to-
ward religion.”

r. Bowman testiﬁed that his rea-
son for keeping the discliarged pro-
fessor “in the dark” about his dis-
missal for four months was due to the
effect such an act might have on the
Cathedral campaign, then in full
swing. Also, Dr. Bowman maintained
that a year’s full salary was paid to
Dr. Turner “as a. bargain to keep
peace in the family.”

When questioned further concern-
ing the payment of the year’s salary,
Dr. Bowman offered two reasons for
the action. First was a consideration
of Dr. Turner’s welfare and second
was the confusion which might be
thrown into the Cathedral campaign.
When asked why he was afraid there
would be confusion if his act were
fully justified, Dr. Bowman replied,
“Lord knows, but I knew there would
be.” He contended further that “there
is nothing unusual” in paying a year’s
salary to a man who has left the Uni-
versity.

During the course of the cross ex-
amination by Vvilner, it was brought
out that the Chancellor receives a
yearly salary of $31,500. Efforts on
the part of the liberal counsel to at-
tempt to get information concerning
the salaries of the University pro-
fessors were deﬁnitely balked by
Eugene A. Caputo, chairman of the
investigating committee. The former
Pitt student engaged in a heated
verbal battle with Wilner on the mat-
ter and refused to allow the el'forts
to reveal professors’ salaries.

The question of “diverting funds to
the alumni association” was brought
into the investigation. Dr. Bowman’s
testimony stated that he did not be-
lieve it wrong to divert state funds for
the maintenance of the association.
The Chancellor explained that such
money comes from the general fund
and that the state supplies only 26
per cent of the University income.

Called to the stand on the matter
of the arrest of three students on com-
mencement day of 1932, W. Don Harri-,
son, director of athletics, stated that
some of the testimony delivered by
Common Pleas Judge M. A. Musmanno
concerning the incident was untrue.
Harrison said that Dr. Bowman had
not given him orders to make the ar-
rests. The boys had carried insulting
signs into the Y hut, at the time re-
served for commencement proceed-
ings, and locked themselves into" a
room to which Harrison and a. police
officer were denied admission.

Harrison further testified that he
did not prefer charges against the
boys and that he had twice sought to
bring about the release of all three
of them. Two were students in the
University, Harrison said.

Buying Society To Honor
Member Tomorrow Evening

 

A bronze trophy for inanagement ef-
ﬁciency and cooperation will be
awarded to one of its members by the
Cooperative Buying Association at a
Janquet tomorrow evening at 6 o’clock
in the Pi Kappa Alpha house.

Points -considered in choosing the
winner were the improvement of the
fraternity’-s ﬁnancial condition during
the past three years, the degree to
which the fraternity had cooperated
with the association and the prompt-
ness of the house in paying its obliga-
tions. Cooperation, rather than total
buying volume, was the most im-
portant item in the judging.

 Letters From Readers 

Editor, Pitt News:

An article in \'Veduesday's News
states that the Executive Coniinittee
of SFA has decided that Leah Stark
will be ﬁfth senior woman representa-
tive in SFA. ulthougli Elinor Brown
polled more votes than Miss Stark. In
support of the decision the committee

Illlotes Article VI of the SPA Con-
stimtion,
If the constitution precludes the

acceptance -:11? any names written on
the ballot other than those approved
by the coninlittee, v.'h_\' were the votes
for Miss Brown counted? Her name
should have been <lis1'eg:-nrded and
the complication would have been
avoided. Furthermore, the committee
er1'ed in eliminatingr, Miss Brown's
name from the original list of 184
candidates; the election showed clear-
ly the preference of the students, and
the SEA, pl'P.'5lllll1ll)ly, is supposed to
know and reflect student opinion.

I‘. did not vote for Miss Brown, but
I believe that an injustice is being
done her and I think tl1at‘~it can and
should be prevented. _ »

There has been much talk of stu-
dents i‘avoriu;;‘ a. new constitution for

gPennsylvania: it appears that,-.—the
;SFA const1tuI.ion could stand revision.
galtliough the organization is only ou.--
year old. ll‘ the constitution prevents
the a(.-ceptam-e of candidates whom
the Illdj0l'lt_V of students elect: it
should bc (-l1i1i1;;eLl.

The News article states: “In the
case of .l. l2v.l2’ar Spitz and Walnu-
Hart, junior (-andidates who tied for
tenth place. the committee r(-:com-
mended a recount.”

The ballots should have"‘been ro-
counted immediately upon discovery
of the tie. lf the second count results
in the election of either ca‘nd.i(la1:r.
after lapse of time and possibility of
ballot-stui‘:fin::_, a. question must in-
evitably arise in the minds of the stu-
dents.  .r(lle.=.s of which candiclatc.
if any, is elected, the doubt must still
be there.

It is well known that student activ-
ities at Pitt are dominated by cliques.
and these instances in the election
may hint of possible unfairness. '.l‘l1r-
two cases in question should be re»-
submitted to the vote of the student
body, '

Pittsburgh, Nation-wide Business
Shows Recession For March, April

 

By Reubin Sieslnger
Accordizg to the _.r:eneral review of
business for the Pi‘ciisl)111'gh district
and the United States during Mai-cli

and April, containecl in this month’s_

issue of the Pittslmrgh Business Re-
view, monthly publication of the
Bureau of Business Resc:1rch, it is
shown that business has receded dur-
ing both months.

The indices for these months show
that the spring peak was reached in
l*‘ebr1'=.a.ry. lndustrial curtailnient has
been more pronounced in the past few
weeks and the gain in the volume of
trade has been only moderate, con-
sidering the l.‘-act that Easter was
three weeks later this year than last
year.

5 Billions to Spend

The Review considers the ﬁve billion
dollar work-relief bill from two points
of View ﬁrst, its favorable aspect in
beneﬁting business tlxroagli the huge
expenditures, and second, its move-
ment towards over-extending of the
government credit.

There have been three brief periods
of recovery since 1932, but in eacli
period there was no extensive pickup
in private construction, no large scale
railrozul liuyitig, no a.pprec.iable ex-
pansion in foi'ei.-4'11 trade. nor any gain
of note in new private ﬁiianciug. For
any sustained 1'e'covei'y, the editor con-
tinues, it is iiecessary that there be
improvement in these lines.

In spite of the recent recession, busi-
ness lms improved substantially dur-
ing the past two years. The {LV(3l‘2l.E;l’
total industrial production in the
United State.-7 was nearly 3 per ccni.
greater in 19214 lhaii in 1933, and the
production in the first tln-ce month.<
of 19:35 r-xceedreri that of the 'ﬁ1‘stquur-
ter of 1.933 by 44; pe: cent.

Increase and Draught

Five major x'«.-as-:ons are assigned by
the editor to account for the increased
rise in wl1ole:s.a.l<-2 prices. These include
inflationai-3.-' scar-9, production curtail-
ment anioiigz international p.-rodu(:e;'s
of copper. comfinuanc-.e of the drought
condition in The Middle V‘i-‘est, a.nticipa—
[ion of increased governiiicntal ex-
pendimrcs and reduction of stocks.

The a(l]‘usted index for busine:-is in
the Pit.tsl)1i1':.§li_ district was 72.9 in

Marcli, compared to 72.8 in February.
However, slumps in the zﬁrst. 'l.hre<-»
weeks of April almost completely dis-
counted the entire gain of the first
quarter of 111-15. Drastic curtailmem
in coal produ<:1iion_ and decreased rail
shipments were noteworthy in the dc-
cline of April.

As a. special. feature, the Review
contains an article on “Condition of
dwelling houses in Allegheny co11nt_v_."
by Dr. J. P. \Vatson_. assistant director
of the Bureau. Dr, Watson presents
the thesis tli_-at the collapse of real
estate v:—1ln+.~s' was one of the major
factors jeop:u'<lizing the ﬁnancial Sl.l‘ll('—

cial relief.
