Final. arrangements have ‘been
completed for the immense Cap
Gown production, “The Maxixe Girl,”
which is_‘to be staged in the Schenley
Theatre, on Friday, and Saturday
evenings, February 26 and 27. So
great has been the demand for tickets,
even at this early date’, that the
maiiagémeiit has deemed it advisable
to engage the theatre 1 for an after-
noon" performance, so the production
will also be presented on the afternoo
‘of Saturday, February 27th.

The rehearsals of the~p'ast week have
shown that the show ‘is to, be the
greatest ever presented to any Uni-
versity audience. The talent -has‘ de-
veloped in such a manner as to fulﬁll.
the hopes of-the most exacting of
{dramatic Tcritics. It is hard to desig-
nate the real star of the performance,
all the participants will come in for
their share of the glory._

Among the more prominent of the
cast, John A. Thompson, Ec. ’17, and
C. H. Corbus, Mines '16, are ’real
commedians, and it is predicted that
something rich is in store for. Cap &
Gown patrons when these two appear
before the footlights. Corbus takes‘
the part of Jenkins, the private
secretary and is in a role peculiarly
adapted to his personality. Thompson
plays the part of Alexander, the
negro porter -and it may be said,
without contradiction, that one would
have to go a long way to ﬁnd his
equal. ' g _ . V .

Then, a feature of the performance
will be the work of Palmer K. An-
drews, Col. ’17. He ..takes the part of
a Spanish adventuress and does vitrwith
such reality that op
lieve that he is a real adventuress
and Spanish. It is expected that noth-
ing seen on the professional stage will

“eclipselthe work of Andrews.

Alvin Johnson, Eco., ’17, last year’s
wonderful success, will play the title
role, and possesses the dignity and
ﬁneness of a real character. Johnston
is the man most’adapted for the part
and the club feels itself ‘highly com-
plimented in his interpretation of the
Maxixe Girl. He is a real actor and
it is doubtful _if his proper indentity
can be detected. . .. d

Then there is Emerson H. -- Landis,
Ed. ’16, as Maurice Bostello, the .-¢lead-
ing man. . Landis has a ﬁne personal
appearonce and after beating out many
formidable competitors for the place,
he can claim the ‘distinction of being
the “handsomest ‘leading man” on the
stage. — . ' .

A. L. Wolk, Law ’15, of last ear’s
success and H. K. McDiarmid,
"Dent. ’15, will play parts which will
eclipse all their previous efforts along
these lines and real acting will char-
acterize all their work. -

Dent. ’15, will take parts that demand

the greatest dramatic skill and are

expected to meet with the most.
enthusiastic approval, C.‘ A. McFeel‘ey,
Col. ’18, takes the part of a, soldier
boy and does it with real quality and
military bearing. ' - V ~ ,
Tickets will be put on. sale for
students Monday,‘ February 22nd, in
Schenley, theatre. The tickets‘ due the
students on student activity books will
be distributed this morning fromthe
oﬁices of the respective Deans,‘ and
may be exchanged at the Schenley

failed to score from the ﬁeld. but gave
Pitt twelve points from the. foul mark.
Matson1’s onl score was the result of

next two tries were misses. »McPher-

After Lubic’s third foul, Graham help-

by drooping one in from somewhere
out in the suburbs. McPherson tied
it up, but Hastings, following up' a
iong» shot and taking it on the re-

basket, taking Pitt up to seven. After
missing one try, Lubic made good on

affair. Three hundred’ and ﬁfteen per-
sons were seated at thetables, and
an enjoyable time was had ‘from 6:30
until 10:30 o’clock. I ' '

The chief purpose of the gathering
was to disclose the facts regarding the
University in. its wonderful growth
during the last few years.
course, for. the purpose of indicating
the need of adequate appropriation
from the State Legislature. It"is not
easy for those most intimately con-
nected with, the University to realize

. just what. a group of three hundred

members of the teaching staff look
like. The opportunity was presented
on Saturday evening.
s ena tors, representatives, mayor,
councilmen, ‘even the professors. them-
selves were made to realize in an

unusual way just What the University

has become. The who1e,aﬂ"air,' under
the leadership 2' of. E. V. Babcock, who
acted-ras toastmaster, was most happy-
from beginning to end. Thé- only
matter of ‘regret was that the hour
becamejso late as to make impossible
the exhibit of the moving pictures,
for Which preparation had been made.

"The, University oiﬁcials. pictured C

_vividly the growth of the University

and more. than all," in service to its

constituency. , Addresses’ were" made
by the Chancellor; by Dr. C. E._Zieg-

Professor _C. B. Robertson, for the
Department of University Extension;

‘by Dean H. E. Friesell, for the School

of Dentistry; by Dean W. G. Cham-
bers, for the School of Education; by
Dean J. T. Holdsworth, for the School
‘of Economics; and"by Dr. R‘. F. Bacon,
for the Mellon Institute. Each
speaker indicated‘ the inadequacy of

the present facilities for carrying‘ on

the work which the .Un_iversity is -in
duty bound to perform, and,_th‘e ab-
solute necessity for increased approri;
ations, in order that these facilities

may be enlarged. . . - 
 Representative James ‘F. Woodward,
chairman of the House Committee on
Appropriations, spoke most, effectively,
urging cooperation and .co-ordination
between the University of Pennsyl-

vania, the Pennsylvania State College-

and the University of ‘Pittsburgh. The
eloquent‘ address of Senator Charles
H. .Kline', wherein he set forth the
injury done to the University by the
excessive cutting, down two ‘years ago

of the appropriation made by the

Legislature, will long be ‘remembered.

we shall do what we can to foster
the new dramatic spirit and to train
play-goers rather than actors or
directors. Perhaps in the fullness of
time we -shall produce dramatic
writers as well. Who knows?”
'When.aSked whether tgiere were
enough experienced players’ in the
University to form a company, Mr.
Baird ‘said:

“I hope not! The average college
amateur» has been trained. in- the
‘deestrict style’ of acting and requires
‘untraining’ before he is ﬁt material
for serious purposes. Enthusiasm,
moral intelligence and some‘, degree of.

CAP_NIGHT SET ,
FOR MARCH, FIRST.‘

/ “ . .
“What is Cap‘ Night?” -“What do

we freshmen have to do on that day?”

“Are we relieved of "all the chains and

bonds that the digniﬁed sophomores

have laid down for us?” “Will we be

classed as Sophomores’ after March

1, 1915?” These are the questions

which can be heard around thecampus‘
among the ignorant freshmen. They
‘want to know what sort of a ritual
they are about to encounter on that
memorable» day laid down by the
-sophomores -and sanctioned by the
Board of Control and the student
senate. In order_ that the freshmen
at Pitt may know what Cap Night is,
the following is a resume of the his-
tory and the value of the tradition. »

_ Cap Night originated at Pitt when
there were as yet two buildings on the

‘Schenley Farms ‘campus and 1910

was but new]
cheerfulness;

. The plebes are hustled over all parts
of the campus to secure wood for the
bonﬁres on top of the hill. After the
blaze is high, the party assembled
around thebonﬁre and tap the kegs
of cider which the freshmen ‘are
obliged to furnish, everybody joining
in the great jubilee of the -evening.
Freshmen and seniors alike are called
upon to give speeches, and then im-
promptu westling bouts are arranged.

y dressed in her toga of

class, and the sophomore to make this
college tradition add its distinctive
factor to the campus life of the un-

‘  BOX

Editor PITT V-WEEKLY: _ _
1Dear Sir: ~ - ' - 1
 Complying with your request, I
submit for what they are worth. my
ideas» regarding- the “honor system.”

The honor system is ﬁne and the
finest thing about it is that its adop-
tion can be forced upon the University
whether or not.

‘adopt it for himself and be just as
honorable as he wants to be.V If he
is not desirous of, or intending .to
cheat, why should he vex-l himself
about someone else being watched to
prevent possible cheating? As a
matter of fact, we know that in a
number of individuals, there is a
"certain percentage that are either
weak or crooked;

But,‘you say, there. are no crooks
in our school. Well, in the practical
. world out of which they came and to

crooks enough to make it necessary
to have locked doors and night watch-
men. If I handle other peoples’ money.
. or business, I‘ must furnish bond. All
these things are necessary at present.
How can you expect our ‘students to
differ greatly in human qualities just
because they happen to be our stud-
ents for a time? . ,, t S .
The‘ honor system, as proposed is
unfair to the honest student, it plays
into the hands of the crook and gives
‘him opportunity to make a good_ show-
ing as the honest student. It IS ever
unfair ‘to the crook as he takes ,ad-
vantage of the. loop fhole presented.
and does not become proﬁcient as he
otherwise would in order to pass his
examinations fairly. - . .
But again, you say if there is cheat-
ing, the students will report it to the
student -organization board. _ If so,
then where does the honor ‘part of
.If all
‘the students are honest and honorable

should not be able to see anything
dishonorable -in each other, the very
fact that provisioii is made for such
8.‘ contingency proves lack of faith in
the merit of eﬂiciency of the plan.-

attention should be conﬁned strictly
to his paper‘ and the whereabouts of
the professor ‘or the doings of his
fellow-students should not concern
him in . the least. To divert on him
the supervision of an examination
then implies ﬁrst, improper or rather
ineﬁicient supervision; second, it

creature, 1a “tattler,” or else the un-
willing abetterw of any wrong-doing
-that may come under his notice. a

By all means have the honor system,
but make it real and not a plan for
which “honor .system is but an ar-
bitrary» tearm. -

The law is a terror _to evil doers
only,—-There is plenty of room under
the present system for the exercise
of ‘all the honorable feelings and 11'1-
tentions ‘any student can have.

Mayor Armstrong stated his belief
that Pitt should have greater recogni-

than 1,”. said the Mayor, “the ad-
vantages which you are giving to the
youth of this city and the territory

Garland backed up the .Mayor’s opin-

thealumni. C_harter Daywill be cele-
brated then, with the dedication of the
New Mellon , Institute-- as the prime‘
feature of the occasion. From an al-
umni standpoint, the banquet at the
Hotel’ Schenley in the evening at 6
o’clock is attracting much attention.
The Entertainment Committee has ar-
ranged its plans so that there will be
_,no conﬂict between this aifair and the
reception in the Mellon Institute and
the Cap & Gown show at the Schenley
theater the same evening.’ . ~
During the pastweek, 3500 notices
were mailed to the... alumni of Penn-
sylvania, advising them of the details
of the banquet and enclosing order
cards for tickets.
the response wil be heavy and the at-
tendance "will be larger than at
last Charter Day banq_uet.: ‘
Special. attention is called to the
fact that ladies are welcome. , Alumni,
bring your mother, wife or sweetheart
with you. ‘  .
The banquet will start at 6 o’clolk
and those who expect to attend are
asked to note this fact especially. It
is important thatthere be no delay as
the Entertainment Committee plans to

p. m. . _

A very attractive menu card and
songster has been prepared for. the oc-
casion and all who attend will secure
one. , . _

The list ‘of ’ speakers will include
Chancellor McCormick,’ Dr. Raymond
F. ‘Bacon, Dr. Walther Riddle, and
several of the noted visitors who will
be ‘here for the ‘Mellon Institute dedi-
cation. ‘Charles W. Scovel, ’83, will
be toastmaster. . 1 ~ .

The University orchestra, under the
leadership of" Gus A:-. Schnabel, ’15,
will ﬁurnish the music. . '

Fraternities _and clubs wishing spec-
ial table reservations can secure them
by communicating with the General
Secretary.‘. Out of town alumni are
especially urged to. attend. It is sug-
gested that they devote this entire

THE BEAVER COUNTY CLUB.

1Alumni and students of S Beaver
county will assemble in Beaver Falls,
Friday evening,» March 5th, to organ-
ize 3. “Beaver County Pitt Club” sim-
ilar to the :Teﬂ1'erson county and the
Westmoreland county clubs recently
formed. ;
maqua club, Beaver Falls, at 7 p.1m.",
and will be followed‘ by 1a business
meeting and “get together” time. A
meeting of some of the prominent
students ‘of Beaver county was held
last week and tentative arrangements
made for the affair. It is expected
that the attendance will number‘ in
the neighborhood of 1 one hundred... as
there are several hundred graduates
and undregraduates of “Old Pitt” in

Beaver county. . —
Notices of the meeting will be mail-
ed to all alumni and students whose
addresses are at hand and the “Boost-
ers Committee” composed of promi-
nent student and alumni workers will
follow up the letters and work per-
sonally for a big1 attendance. Those
who d1o not get a letter notice of the
meeting should not feel slighted as
the mailing list is‘ rather inaccurate
and some may be in unintentionally
missed. We want every Pitt man who
lives in Beaver county at this gath-
ering. P 1 1

CHANCELLOR’S LETTER
, . T0 ALUMNI.

Chancellor_ Samuel Black McCor-
mick sent a letter to. the alumni of
Pennsylvania during the »past week,
calling attention to the needs of alib-
eral appropriation from the State for
the University, and also laying ‘ em-
phasis on the remarkable growth of
the institution in all departments dur-
ing the last decade, the consequent

day to the University, attending the T

A,1dinner will be given at the Ta;

needs for more buildings, etc. With
this letter was enclosed a very inter-
esting leaﬂet telling of the relation of
the University to the state.‘ The work
of each school was-reviewed. ' ’
Commenting on the growth of the
University, it was stated that at the
opening‘ of the present year, the en-

rollment of students11wa,1s‘ 754 larger,

than the. same day one year before.
In1 ten years the undergraduate .1en-
rollment has grownfrom 812 to 3494
and the faculty from 1‘41,tol 300.

[Alumni can do much good in the
way'of interesting the legislators in
the University. A letter to your rep-
‘rese'ntative,_ giving some of the __facts
contained in the Chancellor’s,. leaﬂet,
will have its effect. Hundreds of such
letters will be flooded into the law
makers. Why not write one yourself?
You owe this to Alma Mater.

‘A PACIFIC COAST- PITT CLUB.

Ralph E. George, '12, comes for-

ward with a proposition that we ﬁg-
ure on organizing a Pitt club on‘ the
Paciﬁc ; Northwest’ Coast. 1 _,He » writes
the General Secretary for 3 list of
alumni in thatsection and asks if it
would not be desirable -to stir up some
kind of an organization. , .\
.jGeorge is located at Walla Walla,
Washington, being on the‘fac!ulty of
the Department. of Economics and
Business of Whitman college. 1

The scheme for forming a Pitt club
in that-‘section of the United States
may an may not be feasible at this
time. wing to the inaccuracy of the

.records,§ we‘ do not have a very re-

liable list. of alumni‘~located there.
After the Alumni Directory‘ has been
revised, which will be done within the
next six months, such - an organiza-

tion could doubtless be worked out.

We know at this time'of a number
of Pitt men in the state of Oregon.
Drs. Yielding, Van Dorenand Dallen-
