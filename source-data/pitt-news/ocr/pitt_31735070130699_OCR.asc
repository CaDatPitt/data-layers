annual job fair to ﬁnd a position. V
V » A1 yearly event sponsored by the career placement offices,
the Opportunities 2000 job fair takes place today in the
William Pitt Union from 10 a.m. until 4 p.m. Seniors as well ,
as underclassmen of _any major are encouragedto attend to
learnabout companies, network with their representatives and
distribute resumes in an attempt to ﬁnd a job. ‘
The Masonic Temple has hosted networking sessions on
- its fifth ﬂoor since Tuesday night. These sessions are planned ~
so that students can meet and greet potential employers.
Trisha Crowe Gazdick, special events coordinator for the
event, said the networking sessions are good ways for stu-
dents to prepare for the actual fair. ’ _ _i A V
“This isla great way to make the students feel more at
ease for the day of the fair,” she said. “There is some food,
music, a few laughs,.and it serves as a warm—up for the fair.”
With nearly 200 companies planning to attend today’s
fair, last night’s networking event was another opportunity for
students to speak one-on—one with potential employers. The

show, the bus was for Kramer’s

LAUREN RADOM
Staff Writer .

Owning two businesses, running
back and forth to campus between
classes usually on only four hours of
sleep, is a lifestyle most 22-year-
olds would not dare take on.

But people say Ryan Pucevich’s
mind does not function like that of
an average 22-year-old college stu-
dent.

Since the opening of his second
club, Krypto—Nite, on Sept. 15 in the
Strip District, Pucevich has success-
fully managed this hectic life.

“I’m pretty busy right now. I’m
putting in about 85 to 100 hours a
week,” said Pucevich, who is a.mar—
keting major. “I do everything. I’m
here all the time unless I’m at class.”

He said that he is not needed as
often at his other club because it is
only open on Saturday nights.
Alcatraz, an under-21 club, is popu-
lar with young Pittsburgh natives -
he opened it two years ago in

A Allequippa, Pa.

“I don’t need to be at Alcatraz all

the time,” he said. “I have four off- ~

duty police officers and six bouncers
who all know what they’re doing.”
Currently MTV is airing a com-
mercial filmed at Alcatraz, though
the ad can only be seen in Beaver
County. ' »
Pucevich said Alcatraz, which is
also a private club that draws about
400 to 500 guests a night, is a much
easier place to work because there is
no alcohol permitted.  '
“I don’t have to deal with all the
drunks,” he said. 9 1.
1 On the other hand, Krypto—Nite
is still an incredible placelfor meet-

ing young people, hearing good’

mu-sic and eating‘ wings without
spending a lot of money.

“As far as an Oakland bar, it’s
like Peter’s Pub, only about half the
area,” said Pucevich. “It’s good for
people from Pitt who like to go out.
We have pretty bartenders and you
don’t have to spend a lot of money.
There is no cover charge and drinks
are very cheap,” he said.-

Since his high school years spent

working as a DJ at Center Stage, a
club in his hometown of Allequippa,
Pucevich said his success in business
has had a domino effect. ‘Investing

‘ money in stocks helped him generate

enough capital to open Alcatraz, and
with the money he earned from that
venture, he opened Krypto—Nite. .
“As a DJ, I was always interest-
ed in opening up .a club, but you need

a lot of -money and there is a terrible"
risk factor,” Pucevich said. “Things _ ’

just worked out though.”
But’ this wasn’t always his
dream. When he came to Pitt as a

freshman,‘ his ultimate goal was to

work for the Bank of Chicago. ,
“Myuncle is an executive -there,”

he said. -“But now I guess'»I’~m stuck .

here.” ‘ 8‘ _ ‘

Staying close to home near his
family has benefitted Pucevich... In
‘fact, his mother works“ for him at
Alcatraz collecting ‘money.

“I don’t trust anyone else ‘with.

money,” hesaid. _ J -
Jennifer Roble, Pucevich’s girl-
friend of more than two years, has

also been extremely supportive and

a student entrepreneur

helpful by bartending, cooking, set-

ting up for karaoke night 'and’hand- ‘
ing out fliers and menus to people on .

thevstreet.-Roble even serves as the
club’s DJ when Pucevich is at class.

“Busi1’1ess'-has been great so far,” L I

said Roble, who also manages to
keep up with her ‘classes. ‘‘We’re still
getting the word out to companies.
Last Thursday I was off, so I tried to
round up a bunch of people.” ‘
‘Roble added that although

‘Pucevich shares all his ideas with
-her, ultimately, he decides on every-
~ thing. I

“He’s very ambitious’ and I’ve
never met anyone like him,” Roble
said. “It’s very/‘exciting watching
him work. He’s made the 'dean’s list

‘ since -I’veknown him.” . 1
‘Although the only.‘ free 1 time ’
‘Pucevich. has is used; fofjsleep, he is

pleased with the business.

“It’s been good so‘ far,” he said.
“I’m definitely going to ;stick with
this after I graduate.” ’

Pennstate bans Napster on network

ALISSA WISNOUSE

Daily Collegian

(U-WIRE) UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa
—— Napster fans at Pennsylvania State
University found an unpleasant surprise in
their e-mail in—boxes Thursday morning.

Wednesday night and’ early Thursday
morning, all Penn State students were
warned via e-mail that the university can sus-
pend the computer access account of anyone
who uses programs like Napster through
Penn State’s network to infringe copyrighted
works.

The mass e—mail came a week after
Penn State President Graham Spanier

Laga

October 3, 2000 A
Pittsburgh, PA

received a a letter from Dr. Dre and
Metallica’s lawyers asking him to ban
Napster from the university’s computer net-
work. "

Dr. Dre and Metallica‘ feel Napster soft-
ware encourages people to steal copies of
their music, which violates their copyright
and drains money from their album sales.

Napster representatives could not be
reached for comment .

The new policy governs the use of pro-
gramssuchasNapsterthatcanbeusedto
duplicate copyrighted material. Use of these
programs to copy non—copyn'ghted materials
will not be banned, Penn State spokesperson
Steve MacCarthy said. _ '

The Napster Web site does not make it

Appearing at:

  Music X 

clear which ﬁles are copyrighted and which
are not. .
“Although it is not the intent to curtail
legitimate uses of such software, the univer-
sity has an obligation to ensure that its net-
works and computers are not used to violate
the law or university policy,” said Rodney
Erickson, executive vice president and
provost, in the e-mail. V
.Joe Di Cicco, a sophomore ﬁlm and

‘ video major, disagrees with the new policy. ‘

“It’s none of their business what We do

V with our Internet connection,” he said. “I

think people are going to be really pissedoff
about it.” -— .

The e-mail said any computer connect-
ed to Penn State’s network in any way could

‘State’s network" within‘

.
E

be monitored for violations and that users
should be aware that Penn State has a pro-
gram of continuous review of network traf-
ﬁc to identify copyright violations.

I Penn State can scan trafﬁc characteris-
tics of computers on its network, but the
scans will not examine the content of the
computers. ' ;

“We are not Big Brother looking at what
they are doing on their computers,” Erickson
said. ‘We are asking why traffic. is the way it
is. Why it is consistent with that of down-
loading ﬁles?” ‘

About 80 on-campus students and one
staff member were identiﬁed as heavy users
of copyrighted ﬁles during a scan conducted
this week Wednesday or early Thursday
morning, they received e-rnails telling them
to delete the ﬁles or disconnect from Penn

seven days",
 said. A . '

If the users do not respond within one
week, the university reserves the right to
withdraw their access account privileges,

Erickson said. ‘ ' «

Although the university won’t be look-

ing at the content of computers, the idea that
they are monitoring individual usage bothers
some students. _ '
‘”Ihat’s appalling,” said senior Tara
Gemer "~Ihat’s terrible that they can just go

. on your computer.”

_ Users can» also have their access
accounts suspended if a copyright holder?

contacts the university, accusing the user of A

copyright violation. , «_

However, tech-savvy users may be able.
to get around this. ;

“Having it banned won’t stop it ﬁomi
being used,” said senior Ken Pierson. “Youf
can dial into Napster through a remote host.’ ’;

However, university oﬂicials hope the}
policy will cause a decrease in Napster;
usage, which will speed up A the network}
“Clearly, this is something that does eat up a

lot‘ of bandwidth,” MacCarthyl said:

Bandwidth is a term that indicates a system’s
trafﬁc capacity.

9

Ben Frisbee, a junior, agreed with Penn; '

State’s decision to limit’ Napster usageé
because it clogs up the Internet, making 
harder for others to usethe Web for home-ll?
work. ' ' 

“They [Penn State] should shut’ 
down,” he said . ‘

A survey. done by Gartner Group Inci A

released last month found that 34 percent oﬁ
colleges surveyed have banned Napster oni
their networks. ' S 
Some of the other universities that}
received the letter from Dr. Dre andl
Meta1lica’s lawyers are responding 
to Penn State. Massachusetts Institute of;
Technology, University of California at;
Berkeley, Duke University, University oii
Michigan and Stanford University won’t;
prohibit Napster use altogether, but they 
investigate and~take action if they receive;
complaints from copyright holders, saidi
Debra Zumwalt, acting general counsel foré
Stanford ~ . “

E”"°'“A'-   retire rarest
Pitt should not follow Penn?  “T 

On Wednesday and Thursday of
last week, students at Penn State
University received e-rnails from the
university administration notifying
them that they must stop using Napster
immediately or else have their accounts
suspended.

Accordingto the Daily Collegian,
Penn State’s student newspaper, the
university took this action after
President Graham Spanier received a
letter from rap artist Dr. Dre and
lawyers for Metallica, the main group
leading the ﬁght against Napster,
requesting that Penn State not allow use
of Napster on its network.

Carnegie Mellon did something
similar when it banned many students
for a semester from their networks after
they were caught using CMU’s net-
work to transmit copyrighted songs. In
fact, 34 percent of the colleges that the
Gardner Group Inc. surveyed prohibit
Napster on their networks.

What these universities do not
realize, however, is that these progiams
can beneﬁt the music industry. Indeed,
record sales have climbed recently.
Although one could not directly‘
attribute this climb to Napster and other
such programs, they don’t have ascri-
ous detrjmental effect either, as th v
record industry claimed ' r

Rather, programs like Napster
could help the industry by allowing,

State’s lead in banning Napster

people to sample music by diﬁerent
artists. For example, if you hear an
MP3 at a friend’s place and realize you
like it, you’re more likely to go pur-
chase a CD from an artist you may not
have otherwise lcrrown existed.
Programs like Napster can help

many unknown artists gain popularity

and thus sales. Rather than rallying
against Napster, the record industry
should instead ‘work with the people
from Napster for a comprehensive
solution to their diﬁerences. One possi-
bility would be for the industry and

' Napster to cooperate to post songs that

people could download for free. Then
the industry would get free advertising
and Napster would get more_ songs
with better quality. 4

Universities who have banned
Napster should remember that it is not

the only program that allows transmis- .

sion of music over‘ the Intemet.

Programs like Napster themselves are '

not inherently illegal and should not be
targeted in the way they‘ have been
because they have no control over what
their users choose to do with them.

, While we don’t condone the viola-
tion of copyright laws, we also do not
encourage punishing students for using
legal software on their university’s net-
work. We hope that Pitt will not take
the same action as Per_1n State and the
others.

On Sept. 19, I read a very interesting edito- ’
rial in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. This staff edi- -
torial ‘called for the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, and speciﬁcally Gov. Tom Ridge,
toschedule a game between Pitt and Penn State
to continue the Great Rivalry. - ' - .

- We, the students of the University of
Pittsburgh, need this rivalry. Why? If you were
at Three Rivers Stadium for the s ' '
game, you know exactly why —— it C H R '5

How loud were they cheers,
when Rod Rutherford caught John »
T‘urrnan’s pass and ran 62 yards for the garne’s

in the air as the game clock wound down? Did

- you feel the‘ tension of a‘ seven-game losing

streak to Penn State ﬂy away when the ﬁnal sec-
ond ticked oﬁ the clock? There was a certain
relief in the air when it happened: We ﬁnally got
that monkey known as Penn State off our backs.
“ But now where do we go front here? We

don’t really have a rival we all care deeply about ,

Whether we want to admit it, Penn State did
a great thing for us — they gave us something
to rally around, something to unite against. The
student body, along with the rest of the commu-
nity, became one in cheering our team on to vic-

knowing what it’s like to be united with the rest
of this diverse student body against our hated
enemies. It’s a feeling I would not pass up for _
the world. But there’s nothing we can do about
it, so we might as well just accept it, right? ‘

Well, there might be one thing we can do: .
Penn State and Pitt both are state-supported uni-
versities. That means that they get money ﬁom

the state for help with things such as research,
projects, and the like; for us that means lower.

How to freeyourmind in three short days

i H Last summer, I took a break from my
two jobs and just got up and went to a folk
festival. I say_ “up and went” because my
going was somewhat of a sudden, random
event. One of my best friends, Rosalie,
talked three of us into going by reminding

-us it would be our ﬁnal ﬂing together

before we all scattered to dif-
ferent colleges. A week later,
we were off.

 Sure, we were all up for
some good music — we rarely
miss a chance to see Moxy .

,ruv_ous or Vance Gilbert — but initially
we had to balk at the distance. Our friend
Brian, who always drives, wasn’t thrilled
about the prospect of driving from our
hometown, of Philadelphia to somewhere
above Albany, N.Y. However, Rosalie
worked her magic and the next‘thing I

knew, I was stuffed into a tiny car next to

a sleeping bag and some lawn chairs with
my three best friends,-singing along to Ani
DiFranco CDs and heading to the Falcon
Ridge Folk Festival.

, When we arrived there, we received

wristbands to allow for re-entry and went _

in search of a campsite. There was a sign
that said “Quiet Section” and, decidingto
live dangerously, we drove onward.
Eventually we came upon a sign more to
our liking: “Jamming All Night,Section.”
Here, we parked the car‘ and started

unloading. A

After we pitched our tent, Rosalie and
I decided to explore the area and find the
stages. Like most folk fests, this one took

place on a giant farm that some farmer
was cool enough donate to us fest-goers’
for the weekend. We found that, in order to’

get to the stages from the
.campsite, we had’ to climb

down a mountainous hill.

Vfrth great difﬁculty, Rosie

and I made‘ our way down,

checked out thestages and the
vendors, and climbed our way back up to
report our ﬁndings. / .

By this time, the evening had come
and a great many more campers had.
arrived. Adjacent to our tent had popped
up another one pbelongirrgv to four kids
around our age. Fonning an instant friend-
ship with them, we decided to investigate
other campers in the area. ’ '

There were forests" of tarps 20  i

any direction from our tents where musi-
cians gathered and played. Most people
played in a folksy or blues style;.everyone

would listen attentively to one singer play

a song and then do the same when the next
person played. The night was cool and the
stars were brighter than I have ever seen
them, and everything was wonderful; _
The next day, acts began, to take the

stage. We all sat on blankets and listened,

sang and danced under the warm sun. In
the evening, no one cared as it rained
when Vance Gilbert took thestage. We
stayed put and watched the man work his
magic. I cannot think of another musician

who can get a whole audience to sing‘ for

him ‘as heruns out into the crowd and

I jumps around in the middle of it like a bril-

liant madman. _ _
After that, my friends went back up to
the campsite to drink and howl at the
moon, but I stayed down and watched
Janis Ian play her intense solos on her lit-
tle black guitar. I imagined that ‘she must
have spent years playing on imperfect gui-
tars before ﬁnding the one that -ﬁt her so
well. When I ﬁnally climbed the hill and
joined my friends, I was as drunk as they
were, delirious with the love of sound.

The next night, I dancedtwith a boy.

who looked like a rugged Jude Law with
the spirit of Jack Kerouac during Moxy

Fruvous’ and Dar Wﬂliarns’ sets. He was

one of our new ﬁiends ﬁom the adjacent
campsite. We sipped whiskey from a bot-
tle he kept in his back pocket and felt like

hippies, although neither of us are. The

whole crew met up again at the site and

sang songs after the stage music was done A

for the night. People from all over came

and played along with their guitars and

bongos or just sang with us, making up the
words if they didn’t know them. We all felt

beautiful. I looked around at all the dirty
faces around me, and we all really were
beautiful. Everyone who could never sing
before could, and every song we sang was
beautiful.

Sunday ‘evening, my friends and I
hated to go. We stayed until the very last
second, when every remaining musician
there took the stage and sang a goodbye
song. I felt easygoing and free as I walked
up the hill to our car one last time. How I’d
grown to adore that hill! I had found it so
difﬁcult to climb at ﬁrst, but now it

seemed like my great friend, nature’s _

amphitheater for the stage below.

Big music festivals today are nothing
short of disastrous — just look at the mon-
ster we called “Woodstock” If you really
want three days of peace, love-, and music,
go to a folk festival. It doesn’t even matter
if you are familiar with the music. Even if
you hate folk music, no one can come out
of one feeling anything but light and
happy. The Falcon Ridge Folk Festival
was the only place where I have ever seen
people pick up all-of their cigarette butts
before leaving. If the opportunity ever
arises, go — I guarantee it’s worth the
drive.

Melissa Balick believes that every person
should enjoy the peace and love of a folk
festival at least once in his or her life.

Monumental prioritiesfor the mayor

No matter what you may hear to the
contrary, everything happens more quickly
in Pittsburgh. Normally, it takes a long time
to build a monument to a war — just look
at the continued absence of a national World
War II monument after 50—plus years. In the

‘Burgh, hqwever, we are already witnessing-

the construction of another war memorial:

Murphy’s war on democracy, a war that has

gotten aid from former Mayor Sophie S‘

Those of you who are new to the city
may wonder why a mayor would ﬁght

on democratic principles? Well, Murphy is

Stadium mold, a boring park that cost $35

By the mid ‘9iOs, the area paid for the

stadium in such an efﬁcient mannerthat it’

was $45 million in debt _——— not only hadn’t
we paid off the construction costs, but the
interest made us owe more than what the
stadium initially cost. Now, anyone with a

Yet, as elsewhere around the country,

' ﬂiey voted down the stadium tax almost 2- *

to-1 — the ﬁnal tally was 530,706 against
the stadium and only 281,336 for it.

Unfortunately, the democratic will did
not match the will of Murphy and
McClatchy, so they went-to “Plan B.” To
start this off, they had to go through the

And Pittsburghers are now stuck with a

And democracy has been subverted by a
corrupt mayor. ,
However, Pittsburgh isn’t the only city
to‘ get screwed like this. George W. Bush,

‘our Republican presidential candidate,’

almost exactly duplicated our Democratic

  
  

mayor in forcing the taxpayers of Arlington,
Texas, to fund a new stadium for his Texas
Rangers. He even used the democracy-sub-
verting principle of eminent domain, of
which Murphy is fond, to get the necessary
land.

In Boston, polls showed

public funding of stadiums —
yet the Red Sox are trying to

. their money to help millionaire
athletes and owners.

These stadiums make no sense from a
ﬁnancial standpoint. In a Boston Globe col-
umn (Sept. 27), Ralph Nader points out that
a study covering 30 stadiums over 30 years
shows no signiﬁcant impact on the econo-
my in 27 cases, a negative effect in three

locations and a signiﬁcant net positive --

absolutely nowhere. Andrew Zimbalist,
economics professor at Smith College in
Amherst, Mass., has found that the effect of
new stadiums roughly equals the opening of
a new Macy’s branch. Let the good times
roll, eh? ,

Or more accurately, let’s not keep
allowing politicians like Bush, Murphy and
Ridge to roll over democracy in their pan-
dering to corporate whims.

It’s really easy to trick yourself into
believing that everything is going well in
the world. Class schedules tend to conﬂict
with nightly televised news reports, and
textbooks sometimes take the place of
“Time” or “Newsweek.”

‘ Sadly, there are miserable things hap-
pening all around us — so many that a hit
musical can be penned about them, win a
ton _of awards and have international tour-
ing companies picking it up. It’s not
enough to say that “Rent” is a phenomenon
— for some. theater fanatics, it’s become a
way of life.

The story revolves around a group of

Some legends, urban or otherwise, are more safe-
ly pursued on paper or in conversation than in

darkly lit rooms or gloomy back alleys.
Just ask student ﬁlmmaker Amy
(Jennifer Morrison). She is among a
group of promising and ambitious ﬁlm
students at the ﬁctitious but venerable
Alpine University vying for the presti-
gious and proﬁtable Hitchcock award for

student suspense ﬁlms. Amy shows great
promise ——. it doesn’t hurt that she follows in the foot-

steps of her director father.

As “Urban Legends: Final Cut” opens, we see Amy
and fellow students working on various thesis ﬁlm projects
or trying to get speciﬁc projects approved by mentors. One

  
  
   
 
 

 

such student ﬁlm involves an airplane crash scene‘ in which
much of the acting is in worse shape than the disabled plane.

Amy decides to make a ﬁctional terror ﬁlm based on a
composite of real life urban legends. Soon her cast and crew
slowly begins dying violently, one by one, and for real. It is
obvious that Amy has attracted a nemesis that sees no need
to make gore and death ﬁctional.

ed calling “lesbian chic.’’' ,

V “My parents were like, ‘Wow,
you’re doing really well,”’ she con-

-_tinues. “And yeah, I was respected

artistically, but unless you’re Jewel
or Matchbox 20, you’re not rich.”

. Sobule was grateful for radio
stations like WYEP that tlidn"t just
play ‘her singles.

~‘-‘They’re important to musicians‘
like me,” she said._
And as quickly ‘as

Sobule '
beamed ‘into our living rooms, she

was gone.

Technically, she was still

"around, but instead of doing the

solo thing, she opted to hone her

chops a little playing guitar for

Lloyd Cole’s band, the Negatives,
for almost two years.

“I felt like Keith Richards!” she
exclaimed. “I really liked being a

V sideman. When you’re playing solo,

you only think about yourself -—— I
needed_ to take some time to learn

"how to play with others.”

During that tour Sobule also
started writing songs for her newest
release, Pink Pearl. True to Sobule
form, the disc is a collection of
character sketches and commentary
on pop culture. _ A

“Lucy at the Gym” is a diatribe
on today’s —weight—obsessed culture,
while “Mary Kay” is a tribute tn}, the‘
Washington schoolteacher, Mary
Kay LeTour_neau, whoifell in love
and had a child with her student.

_, “There. was a time in high
school when I could have been a
Lucy,” she said. A '

-“I look at songs as short stories

— I’m a voyeur,” she continues..

“Thethird person’ is a safe way to
talk about myself.”

Sobule shouldn’t have any trou-
ble talking about herself tonight —

new song she’s been working on all

Whether relaxing on a comfort-
able couch sipping a ‘martini or-

'dancing wildly near the

stage, the intimate set-
ting of the Beehive
Theater is the perfect-
setting for the innova-
tive jazz and funk
stylings of Schleigho.

Totally instrumental,
Schleigho ‘_(pronounced
sl1lay—ho) creates a sound of
modern jazz-funk that resembles
music from the ‘70s. They have the
skill to set a groove that would
impress the toughest jazz critic as
well as someone who never even lis-
tens to jazz. . .

They are currently touring for
their new album Continent. The
album combines the band’s vast

musical talent with electronics that

help give, it a modern sound.‘ ,
Jesse Gibbon, the jazz pianist, is"

half the songs on the album.

In “Keep It in the Car,” the

Staff Writer

What kind of techno’ album could
make everyday ravers throw down their
glow sticks and start slam dancing? If
such a thing were possible, it would be
the work of Omar Santana.

Santana, a native of Queens, N.Y.,
began spinning after seeing an

by Jellybean
Benitez in the
early ‘80s. Since
then he has

duced ‘ on‘ . the
Tommy Boy; label as
well as others. Santana has
worked on albums for artists such as
Public Enemy, Janet Jackson, New
Order and even the Rolling Stones.

He was an innovator of the “hard-
hop” sound, which is .a combination of
hard—core and trip-hop. '*

Clocking in at 160 beats per
minute, Hardcore for the Headstrong is
not for the faint of heart. The album is a
15-track continuous mix of thumping
bass, predictable breaks and the contin-
uous playback of the same sample.

Santana’s mix of “Omar F'uk It Up

J Kid” starts off strong, but quickly turns

  
  
 
 
  
  
  

into a monotonous thump thump
thump. His mix of- Da Predator’s “Out
of Control” has a peppy refrain of

“Rape and pillage everyone on the

planet,” which may immediately turn
off some listeners. Just be patient
though"—- about three minutes into the
track, the song takes an eerie turn"and

starts to sound like a B movie sound?
‘ track, only much faster. Some might
find this a tasty, treat, with the .

Halloween season looming around the

corner. ‘ _
“Rebel in His Own Mind” is the

high point of the album. Its driving bass

is accented by great breaks and even 

better samples. Santana really “fuks” it

up on this one. The song leads seam-.
lessly S into his mix of Thundergods’ _
‘ “Awesome Power.” It’s a pretty ‘short

track, but equally impressive.

The rest of the album lacks the
chutzpah that the best
tracks have. At 160

beats per minute,
‘ Santana bounces
back and forth
across the line
between innovative
and skull-numbing.

E “Necronomicon”l sounds sort of
like an electronic polka. It’s just as fast
as the other tunes, but it just doesn’t fit
in well with the album. ,

All in all, Hardcore for the‘

Headstrong is a fairly lmixed bag.
There’s no shortage of bass_ on this
album, and when Santana gets all the
ingredients mixed just right',he_makes'a
mean cookie. V .
One warning: If you listen to the

‘album while driving, prepare to get a

speeding ticket. There’s some kind of
mysterious correlation ‘between your
ear and the accelerator. '

With only two seniors in the
starting lineup, Pitt’s women’s‘ ten-
nis team is relying on a youth
movement this season after‘ffi1ish—
ing 10-14 overall last year.

Two freshmen and two sopho-
mores are also in the top six, and as
a result, Pitt head coach George
Dieffenbach is expecting a lot out
of the veterans. .

, “Those two seniors (Dana
Jafarian and Lindsay Carlson) give
us a lot of leadership,” said
Dieffenbach, who is entering his
20th season as; head coach of the
women’s mama: Pitt.

was finalized last Friday, with the

Junior midfielder leads nationally-ranked Pitt in scoring

KAREN BiELAK
_ Stafvfiwriterg

As with anything in life, there’ is
always room for improvement._

Th-is has been ‘obvious through.
the performance of Pitt men’s soc-_'

cer player Mark Sikora, who has
stepped up [this season to lead the

nationally ranked team.
The junior midfielder from Erie,

Pa., is leading the Panthers in s,cor—V

ing so far this year after coming off
two seasonsfin which he "was not
necessarily the .fone: depended on to
score goals. ‘ -

While recording twogsolid sea-A

-sons with the Panthers, Sikora had
just three goals and one assist for
;seven points, during his freshman
year. He saw. action in 17 games but
started in only two of them. In his

sophomore ‘campaign, he managed
two goals, one of which was a
game-winner against Duquesne. He
played in all 19 games during the
season, but ‘was a starter for only
four of them. ‘ P

But times have changed, and,

Sikora has emerged __as one of the
most valuable players on the squad.
Sikora has burst out this season and
has been a major factor in the early
success of the soccer team. ,

He‘ scored the game—winning
goal - in overtime 1 against

_P‘rovidence, keeping the team’s

then-‘unbeaten streak ' alive..

However, he is comfortable with C
 this new" role and doesnot feel any

added pressure, because, as he

pointed out, other people on the

squadcan. score as well.. ' ’ ’
“I think we’re doing really well,

'no‘one has played bad at all this

year,” Sikora said. ‘5A.couple of
guys have "stepped up and every-

'one’s pretty much 'p.la.y.ed to their

“potential.” _

Despite acknowledging the
team’s ‘success and the reasons for
it, Sikora was a bit surprised that
the teamearned the ranking of 18th
its first-week in the poll. He figured
they would be somewhere in the top
20 or 25, but was certainly pleased
that the teain wasranked even high-
er. ‘ ~ . A ‘

A Sikora ‘first got involved with
soccer as a kid when his parents let
him try a variety of sports, includ-
ing baseball and football. But he
was never as interested in » those
sports as he was in soccer. ’ '

Sikora earned three letters while
playing at Cathedral Prep, scoring

because I’m good under pressure. _

arm strength. 

It’s not the Owls’ offense
that head coach Bobby
Wallace is concerned about.

Golfer Casey Martin, 28 years
old, suffers from Klippel-A

disorder severely limits Martin"s
ability to walk as the girth of his

I Martin deals with excruciating

result in amputation.

Martin rides a cart during tour

The PGA has taken Martin to
court twice but has not, been suc-
cessful in keeping the golfer from
riding the cart. The'PGA’s third

The dilemma has sparked many

Dana Jafarian is eight wins  from the 100-victory club at Pih‘.

TENNIS

more Nikki Borza, who will conse-
quently play No. lfor the Panthers.
Borza was voted as: the most valu-
able player by her teammates last
year. In addition, only three Pitt
players have won 100 combined sin-
gles and doubles matches, but
Borza’s total of 29 in her first year
puts her well on the way to a spot in
the 100—victory club.

“Nikki made
improvement over the summer,”
Dieffenbach said. “She still hits the
ball hard, but she is more consis-
tent, more confident and still
aggressive.” _ .

Playing No. 02 for Pitt will be
freshman Jill Williams, ‘who hails
from Media, Pa., which is about 30
minutes -from Philadelphia. If there
wasiever a player who could be
termed an experienced newcomer,
Williams fits the description.

“Jill comes in with a lot of expe-
rience even though she’s a fresh-
man,” Dieffenbach said. “She

FROM PAGE 15

‘played in 10 or 11 tournaments over

the summer.” , "

Williams has a lot of qualities
that make her a good tennis player,
according to her coach.

“She’s tough. She hits the ball
hard and gives 110 percent,”
Dieffenbach said. “She has good
ground strokes, a good serve and
can come in and volley.”

The No. 3 player for the
Panthers will be Carlson, who
comes into her final season with 70

considerable‘

career victories. An outstanding
seasorrcould push her over the 100-
win mark. Carls'on’s ‘play on the
court might not be as important as
her effect on the _team off the court.
. “Lindsay brings us good senior
leadership,” Dieffenbach said. “She
is a very good doubles player and
strong singles player.” '
Jafarian, Pitt’s No. 4 player, has
been a model of consistency in her

‘first three years. She has compiled-

92 wins_ in her career, and
Dieffenbach" says she has an edge
over her opponents because of her
competitive nature. »

“Dana is so tough mentally
when it comes to playing opponents.
She is‘ just so competitive,”
Dieffenbach said. “And she is a

great leader.‘ I” can’t ask for much ‘

more than that.”

V The No. -5 player for ‘Pitt is
sophomore Brooke Yablonski.
Yablonski missed the secondahalf of
last season with shin splints, but she
came back with a vengeance at
Pitt’s first meet of the 2000-01 "sea-
son. - ‘ .
At the Eastern Intercollegiate
Women’s Championships «on,1Sept.
15-17, Yablonski‘ teamed with
Hayley Hughes to win the consola-
tion round of the doubles competi-

tion. According to her coach, that’s 9

a sign that she is on her way back to
a highlevel of play. -

“Brooke had physical problems
that never really healed up too
well,” Dieffenbach said. “This sea-
son should give her a goodichance
to do well. I’m counting on her_ to

Pin NEWS FILE PHOTO

add a lot of depth to our team.”
Hughes, a’ freshman, is Pitt’s
No. 6 player. ‘Hailing from
Sycamore, Pa., Hughes‘ brought an
impressive resume with "her to Pitt.
She played in tournaments spon-

~sored by the -United States Tennis.

Association, and was ranked 21 st in
the Middle Statesregion,

, The seventh and eighth players
are sophomore Jena Fiore-‘and senior

‘Leah Davis. Dieffenbach said that

although the players aren’t in the
top six, they have to be prepared for
competition. '

“Those two~(Fiore _and Davis)
need to be - ready to play,”

 

      

 

Dieffenbach said. “You never know
when we’ll need them for a match.”
1 The doubles teams have been
set, although seeds have yet to be
assigned. One team will consist, of
Borza and Jafarian, who played
together in the 1999-2000 season,
compiling a record of. 11-9.
Another team will be Yablonski
and Hughes, who,as mentioned ear-
lier, have already experienced suc-
cess as a team. . ,_ 1 K
The third team will be Carlson
and‘Williams.  A -
“With that pairing [Carlson and
Williams], I just ‘figured that we

might be successful witha senior‘

and a" freshman,” Dieffenbach said. ‘

One player not returning for Pitt
is Sarah Austin. Austin, who played
No." 1 for the Panthers , last year,

transferred. to the University of

Colorado to becloserto her sister,

, who attends that «school as well;

_ “.That’s going to be atough

loss,” Dieffenbeachsaid. ‘ _i
Dieffenbach said‘ he expects

perennial powers Mi_am_i_ and Notre

Dame to continue tolead the Big);

East Conference, with. new‘ member,
Virginia Tech also making a run for

. the title.

' As a result of the Hokiles’.iadmis-
sion into the Big East, the'Big East

Tournament, held ‘every :year in
Miami, has beenfchanged from all

teams to only six ‘teams.

1 Pitt, which finished 11th injthen.

conference last year, must make.

some improvements to finishin the
top six this season and earn a berth
in the conferenc'e»tournar‘nent. ‘

SIKORA

FROM PAGE 15

62 goals and 38 assists in three sea-
sons of play.’

He earned a number of honors
for his outstanding play, but while
soccer was important, it was not the
only area in‘ which he was _success—

9 ful. ~

Sikora also excelled as a stu-

"dent, becoming a member of the

National Honor Society and being
named to the Who’s Who Among
American High School Students
list.

So when deciding where to play
his collegiate career, Sikora looked
into academics as well as the

. school’s soccer program.

While he received offers to play
soccer for a number of schools,
Sikora said they were not as good

academically as Pitt, and that was a’

major inﬂuence in his decision.

a “I figured I’m getting a scholar-
ship, I like the school, and they
have really‘ good academics,”

Sikora said. “That was the main

reason why I chose Pitt.”

For any college student, balanc-
ing classes and homework among
everything else can be especially

_ difficult.

But for athletes, who spend

a hours on buses or planes traveling-

to and from games, it can be partic-
ularly tough.

jSikora’s solution is to try‘ and
get all‘ of his work done before the
road trips, mainly because unlike
some of his teammates, he is unable

,to study or read or do work on the

bus or plane. A
Typical of many other students

. on campus, Sikora enjoys listening

to music in his spare time and
prefers the mellow tunes of Dave
Matthews or Bob Dylan.

He also tries to find timeto

watch television and follow the_
Boston Celtics, his favorite basket-

ball team, as well as some football
and hockey. ‘

, But during this time‘ of year, I
Sikora’s main focus is on soccer as
-hestrives to reach both personal

and team goals. _

He hopes to finish the season in
the top three in scoringand would
like to finish first in the Big East.

If not, he wants to win the Big

East championship and ultimately-

lead the teamto the NCAA tourna-
ment.

While playing competitive soc-
cer is certainly a key to the team’s

\ success, Sikora knows that attitude

is also a major component.
“Everyone has been positive the
entire year, no one’s really gotten
down or gotten mad at anyone,”
Sikora said. “Everyone has stayed
positive and encouraged each other

A the whole way.”
