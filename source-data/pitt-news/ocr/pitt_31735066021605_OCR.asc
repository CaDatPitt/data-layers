Job market for law school graduates in steady decline,  

By Alissa Smith
For The Pitt News

For many law students, the frustrations
of jobhunting have temporarily replaced
anxiety about passing the bar exam.

John Pease, a third—year Pitt law student
and editor in chief of The journal of Law
and Commerce, has witnessed’ a steady
decline in the job market for law students
over the past few years.

He said 1992 will be the most difficult
year to find a job.

I

“The hardest hit are third—year law
students. They’re trying to find jobs and
aren’t even getting interviews,” Pease said”.

According to Sandra Dolan, director of
Career Planning. for .the University of
Pittsburgh’s law school, the number of on-
campus recruiters returning this year has
dropped an approximate 15 to 20' percent.

Some ﬁrms are satisfied with their present
student interns and plan to hire them after
graduation, Dolan said.

But Pease said that many of the ﬁrms
which have hired interns in the past are

Former ﬁrstlady Rosalyn Carter
and Betty Bumpers, wife of Sen.
Dale Bumpers of Arkansas, kicked
off National Immunization Week
yesterday at Children’s Hospital,

A promoting the immunization of
all children by age two.

They were joined by
Pennsylvania first lady Ellen Casey
in their “Every Child By Two”
campaign.

Both Carter and Bumpers plan
to impress the importance of early
immunization on parents and
advocate long-term policy
changes that will assure full
vaccination for all children by
two years of age. '

“We want to get the program
so secured and set in the country
that it will last,” Carter said. “We’re
going to work with the spouses
of governors, congressmen and
legislators. We’ll' mobilize the
women in this country to save
our babies.” .

acting director of Children’s

Governor to honor Gouldfor Crime Stop

By David T. Welch

Asst. News Editor

Like many of his Student
Government Board colleagues,
Andrew Gould made a campaign
promise to increase campus
safety. Gov. Robert Casey would
say that Gould fulfilled that
promise.

Gould will go to Harrisburg on
Oct. 18 to receive the Governor's
Citizen Crime Prevention
Volunteer Recognition Award for
his “Crime Stop” program, which
began this month. The award
recognizes citizens who make
significant contributions to
community crime prevention. —

“Crime Stop” is a

communication network through.

which the department of public
safety can relay crime information
to and from students. Each ﬂoor
of the residence halls has a captain
who is a crime information liaison
between the students and the
resident director. The RDs must
keep in contact with public safety.
Public Safety Director William
Brennan believes the system will
be useful to the campus police.
“If there is something that has
to be communicated very quickly,
we will call the resident directors,
and they will call the captains,
who will call the students. It
works. in reverse, too. They can

call us, and we urge them to. No
matter how unimportant the
information seems, it may be
important to us,” Brennan said.

Brennan’ nominated Gould
because of his efforts in starting
the program.

“Every year police chiefs from
around the state can nominate
someone who they believe has
done something remarkable in
crime prevention. WhatAndy did
was bang on doors to get people
involved. He had a meeting and
kept communication with people
in the residence halls. At one

point, [he released] a survey to ‘

Pitt GSPIA graduate r

By Franco Bonacchi
For T be Pitt News

Pitt may soon have an alumnus
of its Graduate School of Public
and International Administration
as Pittsburgh’s new city controller.

Independent candidate Edward
Kiely, who earned his Ph.D. from
GSPIA in 1982, is running for city
controller to eliminate what he
describes as the political abuse

' the controller’s ofﬁce has suffered

the past eight years under T om
Flaherty.
Kiely wants to make the

controller's ofﬁce a professional- .

auditing operation.

“Flaherty found himself using
the office as a political platform
to advance his political career
and as a result lost credibility as
an objective watchdog of city
operations,” Kiely said.

Kiely said he can win because
Flaherty’s narrow victory in the

and budget.

has grown unpopular with the

public. The recent lawsuits and
controversy surrounding Flaherty
and his office only increase Kiely’s
chances of winning, Kiely said.
“Flaherty’s being brought to task
now about the lack of ethics and
lack of professionalism. I think
we are reminding people that
things can and must change, and
I hope to be their agent to bring
about that change,” Kiely said.
Kiely said Flaherty won the
primary only because his two
competitors, George Ball and
Michelle Madoff, killed each other
off. If Flaherty had lost, Kiely said
he would not be running for city
controller and would still be
working at the Economy League.
If elected, Kiely plans to reduce
the controller’s staff from its
current 95 employees to a more
manageable number of 60, as
well as reduce the controller’s
budget from $3 million to $2
million in an attempt to cut into
the city’s $35 million budget deficit.

The tour will also take Carter

Bumpers’ immunization
program in Arkansas was adopted

by the Centers for Disease Control

states. '

Aside from her work with the
immunization campaign, Carter

The diversity and quality of
research at the University of
Pittsburgh’s Biomedical Science
Tower has attracted international
attention.

Recently, geneticists from the
BST won a $575,000: grant to
study the genetic cause of
Hirschsprung disease. HRSD is a
birth defect which can be fatal to
infants.

“HRSD has only recently been
considered to have a genetic
cause, mainly based on new
information we have uncovered
in our preliminary studies,"
according to Dr. Aravinda
Chakravarti, principal investigato
for the study. . 0

Another genetic disease,
periodic paralysis, is being studied

. by Dr. Eric Hoffman, whose work
with genetic diseases has attracted
worldwide attention.

Kiely
Continued from page 2

Originally from Lancaster, Pa.,
Kiely first became interested in
politics when, as a 10-year old,
he and his brother finished in
second place in a get-out-and-
vote contest that was sponsored
by a local boys club.

This first taste of politics led
Kiely to became active in political
activities such as student councils,
debates and other political clubs
throughout his high school and
college years.

After high school Kiely earned
a bachelor’s degree in history at
the University of Scranton.

Kiely then traveled to England,
where he studied British law for
one year before returning to the
United States and deciding to
attend graduate school.

At GSPIA, Kiely’s interests soon
shifted in a different direction.

“There my interests tilted very
much in the direction of
professionalism in government
and public administration and
away from the froth of politics. I

found myself more and more
interested in understanding the
issues as opposed to
electioneering,” Kiely said.

Kiely also said that he has a
great interest in making
changes. '

“When I was growing up during
the ‘S03 and ’60s, this sort of
idealism was very much in vogue,
and I guess my development was
sort of arrested in that period of
doing important things as

_opposed to making a lot of

money,” Kiely said.

Kiely was admitted to GSPIA in
1968 but was drafted the next
year and .spent the next three
years as an army lieutenant and
intelligence officer stationed in
Washington, D.C.,
returning to graduate school in
1972. '

After 10 years at GSPIA Kiely
earned his Ph.D. in public
administration. in addition to
winning the 1982 Dissertation

Award of the National Association A

of Schools of Public Affairs and
Administration.

Kiely said his years at GSPIA
prepared him for his Career in
public administration by teaching

before ,

 

him that having a purpose is
more important than power.

“So many politicians seem to
llforgetl they should be driven by
some larger purpose, something
larger than themselves. At GSPIA
we were able to learn the
importance of seeking political
influence in order to advance the
cause of good government,
profess-ionalism, honesty, justice
and leadership.”

Kiely also has been teaching
classes at the university since
1972 and is currently an adjunct
professor at the University of
Pittsburgh.

Kiely has worked as deputy
controller for Allegheny County
from 1977 to '79, manager of the
Public/Private Cooperative
Programs for the Greater
Pittsburgh Chamber of
Commerce and director of the
Pennsylvania Economy League
since 1986.

paralegal while going on to law
school, but her experiences at
Brennan, Robins and Dailey

' changed her mind.

“I liked working there, but I
saw all the financial problems the
law firms were having, and it
scared me. If Iwas having this
much trouble finding a job as a
paralegal, the fastest growing ﬁeld
in the business, I couldn’timagine
how it would be tryingto find a

‘job as a lawyer.”

Pease’s advice to law students
is to “work hard and get good

.grades.” But he admits this is

sometimes not enough.

      
 

     
      
     

said.

“Students in the top 15 percent
of their class are invited to join
The journal of Law and
Commerce or the University of
Pittsburgh Law Review.  Even
some of these students are having
a hard time finding jobs,” Pease
said.

But Dolan said these difficulties
have changed law students for
the better. _

“They are becoming better job
hunters and learning how to
reformulate plans,” she said.

Dolan said students need to do
more than wait for employers
who come to recruit.

At the Career Planning
Placement Office, she
demonstrates a strategically
planned job search that
encourages students to be
assertive and think ahead.

“Don’t get in a frenzy  Don’t
get frustrated by mass mailing
rejections  Do five things toward
your goal each week. Milk all
your opportunities,” Dolan said.

Both Dolan and Pease
suggested that students should
be ready to relocate because
almost half of the recruiters come
from out of state. '

Pease found his future job at a
major law firm in Philadelphia,
his hometown. He jokes about

his friends, who are finally getting .

“desperate enough” to consider a
move there.

Students can also look beyond
law—firm positions. According to

.a 1989 study on law graduates, 64

percent of the students went into
private practices. The rest were
divided among judicial clerkships,
military, corporate and
government positions and legal
services.

With their “analytical minds,
problem-solving skills,
communications abilities and
client rapport," there are still
opportunities for willing and
ﬂexible law students, Dolan

Sophie cuts the costs

In order to ease the fiscal crunch, Mayor Sophie Masloff

announced yesterday her plans to lay off 11 0 city workers.

' The layoffs are part of a plan Masloff is undertaking to cut
$35 million in costs to the city of Pittsburgh.

Along with the loss of jobs, Masloff has also considered
merging three major departments, Engineering and
Construction, Public Works and Environmental Services,
according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

These mergers will supposedly increase efficiency
throughout the city.

Masloff claims these layoffs and mergers will help in her
fight not to raise taxes. To do this, an 140 additional
positions will also be eliminated as well._ ’

The Pittsburgh Aviary will also lose funding due to
Masloffs plans, but the North Side facility will not close
down.

Groups from various North Side organizations plan to I

form a _non-profit corporation to keep the aviaries in
business. '

Admission fees will be increased, and donations will be
sought by the groups so that birdwatchers may still enjoy
their hobby.

The mayor claimed to have “nothing against birds, but
the most important thing I must insist upon is thatl will not
raise taxes.”

Many people do support the mayor’s decision, but for
the wrong reasons. The director of the aviary, Lindsay
Clark, told the P0st—Gazette that she was highly critical of
the city operation and was pleased to get city hall out of the
aviary.

The group to feel the most effects of Masloffs scheme

will be Parks and Recreation. A yet—to—be-named swimming
pool will be shut down, along with “a few” recreation
centers. These closings will prevent the mayor from cutting
back on senior-citizen services or playgrounds for
children. . '
_ If axes are the mayor’s bone of contention and not just
something she wants to put in her advertisements around
election time, then more planning must be done by the
mayor’s office to ensure that budget cuts can be made
without sacrificing the jobs of employees. A

Earlier this month, when Ma-sloffs plans for a $150
million baseball stadium were dissolved, the mayor claimed
that “every once in a while I get carried away with an idea.
I’m not afraid to admit it.”

We hope Masloff has given her latest ideas more
consideration. Masloffs announcing of the stadium plans
just before these layoffs were announced makes us wonder
if there is any foresight at all in the mayor’s office.

Evidence to the contrary is staggering.

Televising capital punishment ' 

I don’t know about you, but for
me television news is a hard
thing to watch. I am an optimistic
college student, and I find all the
violence and killing very
depressing.

Sometimes there’s a human-
interest story about a guy named
Bob who can eat Cornuts with his
toes. Occasionally these graphic

portraits of humanity even have ,

comic relief. It appears that news
shows are trying to lighten up
their programs a little, but in the
process they are beginning to
look like those tabloid news
shows that only have stories on
pregnant five-year olds.

I like comedy. I just have a
problem with sensationalism. I
know the news is representative
of the state of the world, but there
are certain things I just. do not
want to see, such as executions.

A television station in San
Francisco named KQED wants to
broadcast executions. Yes,
executions. This is highly
disturbing to me as it should be to
everyone else. Let us not be
gullible and buy into the idea that
KQED wants to do this as a
public service to deter criminals.
It is my opinion that the only
reason for this tacky display of
human cruelty is to boost ratings.

These same people that believe
in “an eye for an eye” might enjoy
seeing a human being die a
terrible death. Does that mean
that we should think, “Well, Fred
killed someone. I guess we're
gonna have to kill him! Hey, we

I find it outrageous, appalling and outright
disgusting that Dr. J. Dennis O'Connor can sit in
front of education committees and declare that

there is no need for added
openness‘ regarding Pitt’s
finances. [;..l_ » '

Sure, who would want the

students and public to know the things like the
$420,000 he has spent on “presidential perks?” I
wouldn't. Why can we not find someone who is
dedicated to schooling and ethics rather than these
clowns who think they need royal suites for oilices?
Why' can we not have a person willing to have an , ‘

better bring our camcorder!”
What could possibly be the

. purpose of filming an execution?

Perhaps the family of the victim(s)
can tape it from the TV and watch
it on boring Friday nights with
popcorn. ’

“Look, Honey, it’s that bad
person that killedour child. Hey!
This is the part where his eyes
pop out and he pees in his pants.
Let’s watch that again in slow
motion!”

Or maybe some psychotic will
see it on the news and decide that
he wants to die in front of the
whole nation on 60 Minutes,
thereby promoting him to commit
a heinous crime and fulfill his
fantasy. Publicity is just what some
criminals want. I do not believe it
is too far—fetched to think some
mentally deranged person is
going to go on a killing spree so
he can be executed in front of
millions. S’

Showing executions on TV
would not be a deterrent, and I
can not think of any other reason
someone would want to see one
happen. According to Donald’
Hook’s Death in the Balance.-
The Debate Over Capital
Punishment, the death penalty
itself is not a deterrent. He claims
that FBI statistics show that “most
murders are crimes of passion.»

Letters

   

People who kill are neither aware
nor concerned about either

punishment or even getting!

caught.” Therefore, because of
the publicity aspect of showing
executions on TV, they would be
requested more by the criminals
and by the public.

Gary Gillmore, who was found

guilty of first-degree murder,
requested execution because he
did not want to spend his whole

/life i-n prison. After being .
convicted, Gary told his layers .

not to appeal the decision, and
he even expressed contempt
toward those in the American
Civil Liberties Union that tried to
prevent his execution. In 1977,

Gary Gillmore was put to death

by firing squad. -
For proponents of the death

penalty, choice of execution by,

criminals like Gary Gillmore is
very disturbing. This punishment
is supposed to end crime, not
induce it. It is my contention that
by joining showbusiness and

capital punishment together, '

society creates a dangerous
mixture of criminal promotion
and public revenge.

KQED should not be able to
broadcast executions. That will

show a complete disregard for‘.

human life, and although the
murderer was not that concerned
with the life he took,’ even
criminals have rights.

' Keith Hamilton (92) will face a speedy Marquel Fleetwood and the Minnesota offense this weekend.

By Derek Willis
Asst. Sports Editor

The offense Pitt will face
Saturday did not score a single
point last week.

‘In fact, the Minnesota offense
has scored just twice all season.

Still, Pitt head coach Paul
Hackett is impressed.

Hackett, who knows something
about the potential of an offense
as opposed to its realization on
the field, just might be correctin
his reaction. Case in point: The
1990 Pitt offense, whose
production ranged from a paltry
75 yards rushing against West
Virginia to a 194-yard rushing
output versus Temple. Also, the
passing game had results that

‘varied greatly too: 106 yards

versus Miami and 384 against
Notre Dame. »

The Golden Gopher offense
has had its ups and downs, too,
but the consistent factor is
quarterback Marquel Fleetwood.
The fourth—year junior from

.defenses.

   

Decatur, Ga., is the type of
combination player that worries
Fleetwood has
completed 55 percent of his
passes in two games this fall for
368 yards and a touchdown. Also
a threat to run, Fleetwood had
five rushing touchdowns last
season.

“He’s our catalyst,” said
Minnesota head coach John
Gutekunst. “Marque1 is quick-
footed and has above—average
arm strength.” That description
makes Fleetwood a likely
candidate for an option offense,
but he’s more than that, according
to Hackett.

“He’s more complicated than
just an option quarterback,”
Hackett said. “He’s an excellent
passer, not just a good one.”

Hackett went on to compare
Fleetwood to Syracuse QB Marvin
Graves, saying, “You have the‘
threat of the option, which is
tough, but you also have his
ability to be an accurate passer.”

Panthers rely on senior leadersbipfor team success

By Bob Maselli
Staff Writer

. For most of the past five seasons,
the Pitt football team has. gone
through many transitions,

eincluding coaching changes,

administration changes, personnel
changes and players leaving the
team to take their endeavors
elsewhere.

This is enough to make your
strongest seniors fall apart.

But not this years seniors,

namely fifth-year players, David’
. Coleman and Scott Miller.

Head coach Paul Hackett
praised these athletes for staying
focused on what they have to do.

“[David Coleman] has quietly

done a tremendous job for us on
defense, not only this year but
-last year as well,” Hackett said.
“He is one of those seniors that
have really had an impact, in my
mind, on the entire football team
in terms of setting the tempo.”

Colernan, who is making his
presence known in the college-
football world, is a bit more
humble when he speaks about
himself, eoncentra ting on the team
aspeet of the Panthers as his main
concern.

“As a fifth-year senior, I have
experienced a lot of highs and
lows, but this year there is a lot of
senior unity, a lot of togetherness,
and there’s not one man that

V really sticks out,” Coleman said.

“Everybody is fighting together
for the same cause.” _

Coleman knows that this year
is far from over, and even though
the team is 5~O, he is not
completely satisfied with the way
things are. He realizes that at any
time the season can turn around.
He feels this week, though, the
team is ready for the Golden
Gophers and the week off wasn’t
a “slowing” factor.

“Last year was a very down

experience fer. 1.as_.a.11.b¢9au§s=_vye

only won three games, and we
are at the same point now as we
were last year,” said Coleman.
“We’re just trying to fight on. The
week off helped as heal some
injuries we had and get-back
onto our feet. .We worked really
hard, and I don’t think it’s going

" to hurt us physically. “

Coach Hackett has an
experienced player on what was
considered a questionable
offensive line. When it comes to
right offensive tackle, Hackett
can count on Scott Miller to be
the anchor man, and his
confidence shows.

“As a senior [Scott Miller] has ,

been a part of that coming
together of our football team,”
Hackett said. “He was part of that
group that was very instrumental
in putting those guys behind us
who are not part of this now and
who do not want to be 100 percent
with us. He took it upon himself
through his own actions and his
own play to set a standard and
tempo. That has had a lot to do
with the start we’ve had so far.”
When Miller came to Pitt in
1987, his older brother, Ed, was a‘
team captain, and from that point
on he watched how certain
seniors, such as Jerry Olsavsky
and Mark Stepnoski, worked. He
picked up on their work ethic
and their “lead-by-example” style.
Now a senior himself, that is
what he tries to do. _
"I don’t really say anything. I
just try to be a leader with my
actions,” Miller said. ,
Miller noted that he, along with

other seniors, are happy withwthe
way things are going thus far, but
his sentiments are right on line
with what Coleman said. The
Panthers are more cautious this
year, trying to remain more
reserved than last year after a
similar start.

“Last year we started out 2-0.

Team speed will lead Florida State over the Wolverines

By Brian Berger and
Rob Pugliese
The Pitt News

Yo, School Boys Two took a
licking last Saturday as Syracuse
shocked the Gators and West
Virginia ate a fat Terrapin
sandwich, but in the hype game
0’ the week we told. y’all
Washington was dope.

Our record now stands at a
still—smokin’ 11-3. It’s time to
rebound like Sir Charles.

Georgia Tech (2-1) at (-8)
Clemson (2-0).

Want a sleeper for this year's
national champions? Then look
no further than Death -Valley,
where the Tigers face a Pee Wee
Herman—like weak schedule.

Next week’s match at Georgia
is the only tough road game, and
the orange and white face both
Tech and Virginia and even the
surprising Wolfpack of NC State
in the extremely unfriendly
compounds of the Tiger pit.

This is the game of the year in
the ACC. These two clubs
combined for 11 of the 22
preseason al1—conference
selections.

Bobby Ross’ Yellow Jackets
come in off an emotional 24-21
victory over rival Virginia. The
Tigers sputtered early before
smashing Temple 37-7. In the
win over the Cavs, Tech tailback
Jimmy Lincoln ripped it up for
229 yards. ,

Quarterback Shawn Jones is
still one of the nation’s most

exciting and dangerous players.-

The offense looked much

Continued from page 8
Then everything just snowballed
downhill,” Miller said. “We are
pleased that we are 5-0 at this
time, but we have a lot of work to
do. We are far from over.”

smoother against BC and Virginia
than it did in the loss to Penn
State. It doesn’t take a genius to
figure out that the Eagles and
Cavs have soft defenses.

One note here: Tech has beaten
Clemson two years in a row, and
Coach Ross has said that the win
at Clemson two years ago was
the catalyst that turned the
Rambling Wreck football program
around.

Twice is nice, Bobby; three is
revenge. Clemson starts twelve
seniors, and these guys smell
Citrus. ,

The Clemson defense that the
Jackets face this week is one of
the nation’s meanest.

They’ve allowed
touchdown in the last 12 quarters,
dating back to last season’s 30-O
whitewash of Illinois in the Hall
Of Fame Bowl.‘

Last year they were first in total
defense, second in rushing
defense, second in scoring
defense and sixth in passing
defense.

They return their two leading
headhunters, linebackers Levon
Kirkland and Ed McDaniel, as
well as nasty nose tackle Rob
Bodine and mammoth tackle
Chester “the molester”
McGlockton, from parts
unknown, who weighs in at 315
pounds.

The Clemson defense ain't no
joke. The Tech offense will be
forced to do the adjusting in this

one

contest, as the Tigers control the
line of scrimmage. They don’t
call it Memorial Stadium for
nothin’.

Take Clemson minus the 8
as they bury Tech.

(-3) Florida State (3-0) at
Michigan (2-0), Saturday, High
Noon, ABC.

The Seminoles are ranked No.
1, and the Wolverines are ranked
No. 3. Forget that.

What we have here is the two
most talented teams in the nation
right now.

This game is the ultimate in
college football — Ann Arbor;
Mich., with 102,000 maniacs going
insane. Al_l—American candidates
are all over these lineups. Elvis is
in the house, and Casey is at the
bat.

The tomahawk chop has
wielded its mighty blow on three
Saturdays in this young football
season, annihilating Brigham
Young, Tulane (who does the
Green Waves’ scheduling?) and
poor Western Michigan.
Quarterback Casey Weldon is still
undefeated as a starter and has
emerged as one of the two leading
Heisman candidates. ‘

This week, Coach Bobby
Bowden is going to need Weldon
all four quarters against the Blue.
Who’s the other Heisman favorite?

superior athletic ability and team
speed. Junior cornerback Terrell
Buckley is the best in the nation.
In fact, pro scouts say Buckley
might be the best corner to emerge
in years.

His devastating speed makes
him a dangerous threat as a return
man as ‘well.

The ‘Noles are also aggressive
as hell and have’ unbelievable

depth; at running back alone, '

State has four legitimate stars.

Michigan‘ comes in off two
weeks of rest after their 24-14
win over Notre Dame. The
Wolverines strength is, well, their
strength.

Their offensive line is massive;
the defensive linemen are
behemoths.

But Michigan can mix it up as
well, throwing burners like all-
universe Desmond Howard at
you, as well as athletes like Ricky
Powers.

Like State, they can beat you all
ways, which is probably why
these are two of the top three

teams in the nation (Washington
being the other).

Sports Illustrated coverboy
Howard could end the Heisman

race with a big day and Wolverine V

victory here.
He and Buckley are both

capable of breaking a big TD run '
every time they touch the ball. If I
we’re lucky, FSU will have ~

Buckley cover Howard in man-

belt in a split decision. FSU
prevails, as their team speed is
too much for the Wolverines.
Take Florida State -3.

. (-10) Pitt (3-0) at Minnesota (1—
1), Saturday, 3:30 p.m., ABC.
The Panthers are ranked 18th
in the latest polls and come in
well-rested after the open date.
Minnesota defeated the mighty
Spartans of _San Jose St. (not
Michigan State) in their opener
but suffered a 58-0 demolition at
the hands of Darian Hagan and
Colorado last week. That one got

really ugly.
The Golden Gophers’ pro-style
offense features junior

quarterback Marquel Fleetwood,
who has thrown for 368 yards in
two games and is also highly
potent as a runner.

There’s not all that much to
support him, but fullback Antonio
Carter has picked up 74 yards per
game at a 4.1 average per carry.
The line is very inexperienced,
having lost four starters from a
year ago.

Minnesota’s defense is led by
strong safety Sean Lumpkin, an
all-Big-10 selection who has 18

tackles in the first two games, 17_

solo.

Senior Joel Staats leads the
linebacking corps after racking
up 89 tackles a year ago. ‘

This defense has allowed 1,075
yards and 78 points thus far; not
stellar to say the least. Hagan isn’t

known for-his passing but had a
huge day against this club.

Basically Pitt should move the
ball at will. Alex Van Pelt should
have a monster game in the
Metrodome.

Look for the Panthers to use a
lot of play-action; Hagan
exploited the Gophers with that
all day long last week.

Pitt traditionally struggles with
mobile quarterbacks, and
Fleetwood fits thebill. _

This will be a valuable
experience for the Pitt defense,
seeing as how Marvin Graves
and Syracuse will invade Pitt
Stadium next month.

We look for a legitimate rout
here. The Panthers will receive
some big exposure on Saturday,
and hopefully they’ll start to get
the props they deserve.

Ricardo McDonald, Keith
Hamilton and Steve Israel will
show the nation why -they are
legitimate All—American
candidates.

The waves rise higher, the
Panthers continue their ’91 assault
mission, and the Gophers will be
looking for a hole in the dome
turf to crawl into by the fourth
quarter. '

Take Pitt -10.

Offense

Continued from page 8
Like Pitt, Minnesota uses a
variety of receivers and
emphasizes the tight end and
running backs. Tight end Patt
Evans averages nearly 14 yards a

- catch and is an importantweapon

in the Gopher attack.
“He’s not all that fast,” Hackett
said, “but he’s an excellent

blocker, and he’s able to sneak
behind coverage.”

At 6-foot, 6—inches and 255
pounds, Evans doesn’t seem like
the type to sneak behind
anything, but Minnesota finds
ways to get him the ball. “He has
tremendous hands, and we use
him quite a bit,” Gutekunst said.

The running backs are young

but big. The leading rusher is
fullback Antonio Carter, a 226-
pound sophomore who has
chalked up 145 yards in two
games, averaging a solid 4.] yards
a carry. Two other sophomores,
Mark‘ Smith and Chuck'Rios, share
the tailback spot. Those two have
combined for 127 yards on the
ground, but they have also put
up some big receiving numbers.
“All three backs have been pretty
impressive, especially in catching
the ball,” ‘ Gutekunst said.

Rios leads the team in
receptions, with nine, and also
returns kickoffs for the Gophers.
He also has the lone ground
touchdown.

The receivers ‘are small and
quick. Senior Keswicjoiner is the
anchor of the corps, and

' sophomore John Lewis starts on

the other side at ﬂanker. No one
player is the “go-to” man, as
Minnesota spreads it around; eight
different players have caught two
or more passes.

The offensive line is relatively
inexperienced, with four juniors
and one sophomore starting. The
senior center and leader of the
line, Chip Brixius, is out this
week with a bruised knee. In his
place, Scott Hendrickson will start.

Minnesota employs an offense
that is “very similar” to Pi'tt’s,
according to Gutekunst. “We run
more of a two-back offense’ than
Pitt does, and we don’t use the
two—tight end set as often, but
we’re still similar,” he said.

Speaking of last week’s 5&0
loss to Colorado, both Guteku nst

and Hackett‘ felt that the true
Gopher offense never got much
of a chance to show itself. “We
got behind early,” said Gutekunst,
“and even though we had 100
yards rushing in the first half, we
weren’t able to overcome the
half—time deficit.”

Hackett agreed, “Their offense
wasn’t intimidated by Colorado;
they just weren’t able to stay in
their plan.”

All that aside, this is an offense
which has yet to score a
touchdown in the first half of a
game and has also fallen behind
early, forcing a larger passing
game. As a result, the offense
becomes rather predictable and,
as Colorado proved, easy to shut
down. ’ /0

and 65 percent said they were
aware of it,” Brennan said.

“I was very honored and
surprised. I’m the youngest ever
to receive the award. There are
25 recipients, and there were
3,000 applicants,” Gould said.

Gould hopes the program will
help dispel Pitt’s reputation for
crime by showing that the
students are trying to” do
something about it.

“Maybe more students will want
to come here” if they know that
something is being done about
crime, Gould said.

The Department of Public
Safety will honor Gould for “Crime
Stop” on Oct. 30 at 5:30 p.m. at
the William Pitt Union.

Gould and.“Crime Stop” have
also helped initiate the whistle

program and the SGB safety

committee, under the direction
of SGB member Chad Wertz.
“lThe safety committee] is com-
mitted solely to safety on campus,
and it is publishing a campus-
safety manual,” Gould said.
Last week whistles were
handedout to first—year students.
The program was a combined
effort by SGB, Public Safety, the
Book Center and Student Affairs.

Last May a new clinical

treatment for Gaucher’s disease,
which BST researchers helped to
invent, was approved by the Food
and Drug‘ Administration.
Gaucher’s disease leads to an
enzyme deﬁciency.

Dr. JohnBarranger, recognized
nationally as a pioneer in the
study of Gaucher’s disease,
helped to develop the treatment,
which is being administered at
Magee-Women's Hospital.

Barranger and other
researchers are seeking to ﬁnd a
therapy less expensive than the
current treatment, which costs
$10,000-$20,000 per month.

Hoffman said that Pittsburgh
was internationally _famous for
medical research, partly because
of the BST and the Pittsburgh
Cancer Institute. “People all over
the world talk about Pittsburgh,”
he said. '
