A iI‘.EGEND OF:ERIN I

When E'rin’s sons went out to,war
In stirring times of old,

They had no waving battle flag
To lead their heroes bold,

But with them rode a harper gray,
Who bore a harp of gold.

, The army camped at fall of night

Within_ a dewy glade, ,
The harper found a mossy couch,
Beneath the 'blackthorn’s shade,
And on a bed of shamrocks green,
His harp of gold he laid. '

Behold! a square of emerald silk
Next -morn before him ‘lay,
An-d on it, lo! his golden harp

force, clearness and conviction.

B1’S IDEAL

 

A perfect man is hard to ﬁnd. \

So say the men of daysgone by.

But_Bl girls will take but that,
None others need. apply. A

HE must be ‘big; HE must bestrong,
Our paragon of mortal man.

HIS shoulders must be broad and»

square; '
HE must be brown with tan.

HE may be light; HE may be ‘dark.

HIS eyes may be of brown‘, or blue,

Or gray, but merry, and the sort
That looks one through and through.

HE must be quick and full of fun.
HE must be jolly, gay. andfree,
And ‘yet throughout HE must main‘-
tain. . '
A quiet dignity. ‘
And HE must have a bull-dog chin,
Undaunted ﬁrmness in the right;
And yet conceit must never mar
HIS splendid strength and might.

For pity" HE must never ask.

HE must demand our love, our all.

HE must be masterful and big;
Must make us heed HIS call.

Besides, of c.0urse, this perfect man

Must look on us as perfect, too.

HE must be human,———anyhow
Enough to say, “I want but you.”

All this may seem too much to ask,
Bu‘t,we’re all waiting for the man
Who seems to us the perfect one.

, We’ll ﬁnd him if we can.

And if we don’t we’ll be old ,maid's;‘

Nice cheerful ones with little curls

And cats and parrots and old lace
And kindly hearts for boys and girls.

We’re_ not, afraid of such a life;

At least, we’re not afraid to "try,

So. We’ll take only perfect men-
None others. need apply.

When is a blow from a lady wel-
come?
When she strikes you agreeably.

Formed long ago, yet made to-day,
I’m most in use when Either sleep;
What few would like to give away,
And none would like to keep-—

A bed.

OUR THANKSS M '

In this last issue of the PITT
\/VEEKLY under the present man-
agement, the editor wishes to express
his hearty thanks to 3.ll‘tl’lOSC'Wl1O
have in anyway aided in the publica-
tion of the paper during the-present
year. No newspaper is the result of
the efforts of any one person, and
every person who has done anything
for the paper may justly feel that he
has played as great a part in the life of
the publication as have ‘the editors.
The man who'“tips off” the story to
the editor‘ does as much for the pub-
lication a§ the man who writes the
story. '

To themembers of the staff, who
have so willingly devoted their time
and energy to the interests of the
PITT VVEEKLV. the editor wishes
to express his most sincere apprecia-
tion of the Work that_.they have done.
There have been times. when it was
‘hard forthe fellows to come to the
University -and work all evening,
when there were so many ‘other

G things that they might have been do-

ing which would have been “far more
oleasantthan writing stories-for the
University paper—vet not one of the.
‘men ever shirked his duty. , _
The PITT VVEEKLY owes a spe-
cial debt of gratitude to Mr. T. R.
Williams. of the Advisory board, for
the interest, which he has‘ displayed
He was
ever ready to do whatever was in his
power to promote the -interests of the
PITT WEEKLY. His experience as
a newspaper man enabled him to give
advice to the editor from time to
time that made possible many im-
provements in the style and ‘general
policy of the paper.’ He was ever
ready to stop’ in themidst, of his
work on the Pitts>burgh‘Press to an-.
swer-a perplexing question that was
bafﬂing the staff of the Univers7ity
paper. When the edition of the
WEEKLY ‘was a poor one, and this
happened very often. the editor was
sure to get a good call from Mr. VVil-
liams. but when the paper.m'easiired
up to a faif standard the call was
supplanted by a compliment.
good work that Mr. -Williams has
done in his quiet way for the PITT
VVEEKLY can be appreciated only
bv thosewho havebeen in close con-
tact with the paper and are‘in a posi-
tion to understand the beneﬁts that
have been derived from following his
advice. We urge the new editor of
the paper to listen attentively to any
suggestions that may be made from
time to time by Mr. Williams as the
advice which he gives comestfrom Ia
man who has been successful as .man-
aging editor of one of the largest
dailies in the City of Pittsburgh and
is able to speakas one who knows.-'

 

A FEW SUGGESTIONS

It is to be hoped, that if_the retir-
inqeeditor of-THE VVEEKLY gives
a little friendly advice to the new staff
of the paper. that he" will be not
thoughfto be egotistical. Any advice
that is given is ‘simply to makethe
task of. the editors who are coming
into the work of putting out=the
PITT VVEEKLY a little easier.
There are. many things that a person

versity paper that may well’b_e h.ande('l
down to the new men who are taking
charge of the work. "It i-s -in this
spirit that a few general remarks will
be made in this editorial for the beneﬁt
of the new heads of the paper. .,

In the ﬁrst ;place the man who takes
charge of the paper must make up his
mind that he will have to make a
great many sacriﬁces in order that he
may do justice to the publication.
VVhile he is at the head of the paper,
it is his
publication ﬁrst in his thoughts.’ He
must be willing to stick around the

printers until the paper is ready to go

‘get sick and be excusec_l

"learns in a year of work on the Uni- ,

uty to hold the University -

on the press: he must be the ﬁrst re-

porter pon the job every \:\7ednesday_

night and the last man to leave his
desk; other members of the staff may
' from duﬁr, but
the head of the paper must be abso-
lutely sick—proof: he must grow to
love late hours and be able to get up
thenext morning with sufﬁcient pep-
pefuleflf to wrestle with the printers
all day: he_ must be able to get news.
whether .people want to give it to the
paper or not. Above all’. he ‘must be
an optimist of the highest type. for
there are‘ times that test even the
patience of an optimistic editor to the
limit. to say nothing of the troubles
that a pessimist would have in putting
out a college paper. Always believe
that‘things are going to turn out,all
right and then bend every effort to
make things come out as you believe
that they will. In conclusion the
only way to make headway as the
head of the PITT VVEEKLY is
to be on the job all the time, for as

sure as you slow down even for a «

minute, sonieone'“,puts it over on

A Goon ‘MAN GoNE

When Chalmers Hall resigned" from
the position of sporting editor of the
PITT VVEEKLY, that publication
lost one of the best. sporting editors
that ever handed -inecopy for a college
publication. ‘In-the twoyears Mr.
Hall has had charge of the sporting
page of the paper. he has done a

great work for the publication, and

has made the sporting page the most
talked. of department ‘of ' the
WEEKLY. - ‘ '

One"‘thing that made the work of
Mr. Hall a favorite with the head of
the paper was the fact that his Copy
could always be depended ‘on to be
ﬁrst class and to be in on schedule
time. \/Vhen things _ were slow in
sporting circles. Chalmers could al-
ways bevrelied upon to_dig,up some_—
thing of interest to thereaders of the
PITT WEEKLY and have it ready

for them when the paper came out.

The ‘

If Mr. Hall continues to show the

same ambitious spirit and ability to»

make good in the world that he has
diisplayed in his work on the Vi/EEK-
LY, his success is assured. ‘Ne wish
him all success in whatever ‘line of
work he takes up‘. and we feel sure
that he will more than make good if
he foll'ows up the newspaper game.

The large enrollgmentnn the dif-

 Roandz'ng Into Condition

 

‘Coach Edmondson and the 1116111-
bers of the baseball squad of the Uni-

-versity of Pittsburgh have been hin-
_dered in their work during the last
- week on account of the poor weather
P conditions.

During the early part of
the week the wet weather put the
"playing ﬁeld-in such a condition ;that
it. was impossibleto have any satis-
factory practice. The last few days,
however, have been bright and warm,
and have made it possible for the
coach and players to make so.m-e
headway. ' . _

The great question that is worry-
ing Edmondson at thevpresent time is
how to ‘develop enough ﬁrst‘ class
pitchers ,to last through the hard
schedule that"has been arranged by
Manager Grove. There are a great
number of candidates out for the
pitching positions, but to date only a
few. of them have shown the ability
requiredto make good with ,a team
which has to (meet some of the best
Over
and Harensk! of last year’s team seEe(r1n
mondson at the present time. There
«are several likely looking youngsters
who maydevelop into ﬁrst class men,

is but at the present time it seems that
"the bulk of the work on the slab this
season will fall on the shoulders of.

Over and Harenski, with some of the
“new men to work in the minor games
on the schedule. If one or two classy
p-itchers should be found‘ among_ the
men- that ‘are trying for the position
at the present time, Pitt’s team will
be 100 per cent. stronger than they
will otherwise. .

In college ‘baseball especially the
pitcher is one of the greatest factors
in the success of the team.‘ The col-
lege man as a rule is not a ﬁ rid at’
ne or

team has more than a fair chance to
makea‘ good record. If. on the other
hand, the pitching department .‘ 1S
weak and the team goes up against
another team that has a good pitcher

. _' they are at a great disadvantage.

There are plenty of good men out
for the inﬁeld and outﬁeld, positions,
many of them uhaving -been on the
‘team during the 1912 season. “Red”

' Smith, who played the outﬁeld la_s-it
[year and was one of the heaviest hit-

ters on the- team. is out again this

* season and says that he feels con-

ﬁdent he will be able to make good
if given .a chance. .McConaughy, who
was unable to play last season on ac‘-
count of_ the one year residence rule,
will be found at shortstop this sea-
He was one of the best players
that ever wore a Westminster ‘uni-
form. and the writer feels conﬁdent
that if he puts up.the same variety of
‘$1’ for Pitt that he played while at
' ew VV-ilmingiton. he ‘will make
things hum around shortﬁeld. He is

. _not only a brilliant ﬁelder, but a hard

hitter, and knows a great deal of the
inside baseball dope. V

will~be in ﬁrst ‘class shape. Back
stops are being erected andbother ,im—
provementsiare being.made' as rapidly
as possible. , .

Grove of the Pitt team received a let-

ter from the manager of the Alle—«

transferred until later in the season,
saying that the grounds at Meadville
were not in verygood playing con-
dition. Grove replied to this letter,
stating that the game would have to
be played as scheduled or he would
have to cancel the return game sched-

how good the team is unless we stack
up against another college and see
how the men stand the ﬁre. I think
that we will have a good team this
year, although I do not wish to make
any rash statements so early in the
season.” ‘

THE PIRATES’ LEADER ‘

    

FRED, CLARKE.

CO_ACH DUFF GETS BUSY

J. M. Duff, jr., the newly elected
football coach ofvthe .Uiiiversity, tak-
ing the place ‘of Joe Thompson,
‘started a new ‘system the first week
ttmt he was in office. He made a call
for all the football candidates _to re-
port for football .practice. This is
the ﬁrst time -that there has'been
spring practice for the football men
"at Pi/tit. The work will only be light
and -is just to get a line on the men
that are coming out for the team
more than anything else at- the pres-
ent time. _

Coach Duff met all the men at the
gymnasium last Monday afternoon
and gave them a little talk in which
he outlined the work that would be
done during the spring. Speeches
were made by several of the prom-
inent members of last year’s team
and by Captain Wagner, who will
lead the team next fall. Coach Duff
is» anxious to getpan early start next
fall and it is likely that the call for
practiee will be made earlier than ever
before. , ,

Another Princeton man will,be ﬁrst
assistant to Coach Duff, if the
rumors that are going the rounds of
the University have '-any truth in
them. He is said to be one of the
best men that ever played for the
Tigers and will make a valuable man
to help out in the training of the men.

It -is very early indeed to make any
predictions as to the outcome of the
football ,seaso'n,’but the sporting
editor would like to have every mem-
ber of the student -body take this
-little. tip from him at the present
time: :Pitt is going to have one of the.
best teams in the history of the Uni-
_versiity'next fall or all the dope that
can be gathered is wrong.

Many ‘ Students   Attend the    
  _. National League Opening

Many of the students of the Uni-

versity were present at the opening

game yesterday afternoon and rooted
for the Pirates. From now on until
the end‘ of the college year there will

be many cuts in the afternoon classes
while the Pirates are making strides
toward the pennant. There is noth-

ing that the college. student enjoys,

more than .a good. game of baseball
and the Pitt man is no exception to
the general rule in this respect.

Nor is the fever for the game con: -
ﬁned to the ranks of the students, for .

any afternoon during the baseball
season you will ﬁnd someof the pro-
fessors of the University over at the
games pulling for Pittsburgh to win.
Of course, the professors are sup-
posed to be grandstand patrons, while

. the students are more or less bleach-

erites, but even the professors are
often found out in the left ﬁeld stands
along with the students.

There is not a man in the Universi-
ty who does not think that the Pi-

rates have a good chance to make‘

good this_ year, and every man is pull-

ing'hard for Clarke’s band, of tossers. ,.

Ifthe Pirates win the xpennant it
means that every student will have a

chance to see some of the games for .

the championship of the world that
will take place about the middle of
next October. This is something
which in itself is of sufficient interest
to any student to make him desire
that the Pirateswin the pennant, and
then every University of Pittsburgh
man -ought to pull for the Pitts rgh
team for the simple reason that they
-are the Pittsburgh team and represent

the City of Pittsburgh on the base-:

ball ﬁeld.
A number of the co-eds of the Uni-.
versity are rabid fans and can.give

advice "to many of the fellows on the.

ﬁne points of the game. Some of the
co—eds were in evidence at the game-
yesterday and they were‘ rooting for
the home team with the same amount
of vigor displayed by_the fellows.

SEASON
GREAT SUCCESS

A The 1913 basket ball team achieved
the greatest success ever’ attained by
a Gold and Blue ﬁve and great credit
is due Coach Flint, Manager ‘Mac-
Quown and the Pitt players for their
splendid showing. A_ total of 24 games
was played and of this number the
team won l7—_—a‘ ﬁne record.

Among those who tasted defeat at
the hands‘ of Pitt’s tossers.were Penn,
Georgetown, Gettysburg, F. & M.,
Swarthmore and W. & J. (two games).
These teams all played good basket
ball and their showing indicates Pitt’s
strength. The teams that managed to
win over Pitt were Penn State and
Allegheny each two games, Lehigh,
VVestern Reserve and Bellefonte. The
last two games mentioned should have
been won wit'h case, but the players
all took a hoﬂday at once and forgot
how to play the game,.the others
were won byteams that seemed to
have a ‘shade on the Pitt ﬁve. .

Capt. Wal=t Campbell ﬁnished his
second year as captain and showed" a
rare combination of qualities; ability
as a player, good generalship in direct-
ing the movements of his team and
sufﬁclient personality to win the re-
spect and friendship of his men. Walt
occupies the same place intbasket ball
that “Tex” Richards held in football
and that is a high attainment.

Johnny Baker was the individual
star o-f nearly everygame. He -is a
good ﬂoor player ‘and a splendid shot
from any angle. Johnny is as clean
a player as there is incollegiate cir-
cles and is also one_of the best. He
has three more years of competition.
Frishman was Baker’s side-kick in
most of ‘the games and this sagacious
little tosser played a great_ gam'e for
the Gold and Blue. He is a good for-
