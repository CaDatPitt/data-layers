Voting problems unsolve  

Causes .of Pitt students’ voting problems remain unknown

Pitt News staff

The Allegheny County Elections Division
will not look into reports that 50 to .100
people could not vote on Election Day un-
less students ﬁle aformal complaint, and
if they do, the investigation process could '
take anywhere from a week to several

. weeks, a county ofﬁcial said Thursday.

Mark Wolosik, county Elections Divi-
sion manager, said students should con-
tact the Elections Division if they wish to
ﬁle a complaint. '

He said he couldn’t remember the last i

time such a large number of people were
unable to vote.

During this week’s‘ election, up to 100
people who showed up to the polls were
not on the general register in Ward 4 Dis-
trict 7, based in Soldiers and Sailors, said
Blithe Runsdorf, a judge of elections who
was "working there.

The reason is still unknown.

Runsdorf said that most of the people
who couldn’t vote said they had filled out
registration forms intheire dormitories.

She said none of those students re-A

- membered which organization handled

their registration. _

Wolosik said that registered voters I

should have received registration cards
two weeks after they submitted_their
forms. If they hadn’t, they should have
called the county to ask about it.
Although it’s possible the registra-
tion forms were misplaced somewhere
throughout the process, it’s also possible
that it was the voters’ fault they weren’t

put a social security or driver’s license
number, or putting an address down that
is out of Allegheny County, said Diane
Boscia, manager of voter registration for
Allegheny County.

“In those cases we send a letter out
to correct or get the needed informa-
tion to process the form,” Boscia said.
“The forms remain in pending until this
is done.”,

The students who couldn’t vote during

the election on Tuesday should have had ,

the opportunity to file an provisional bal-
lot if they thought they had registered.

‘ Runsdorf said no provisional ballots
were filled out in her precinct, an oppor-
tunity guaranteed under the Allegheny
County Procedures for the Conduct of
Elections.

The workers are supposed to offer pro-
visional ballots to everyone, and election
workers will later determine whether the
person is actually registered, Wolosik
said 1 A I V

“If you’re not registered, the provi-
sional ballot won’t help you,” he said.

Although officials were hesitant to say’

fraud could have been the culprit, they did
mention the dangers of submitting voter
registration forms —— anofficial document
with personal information — to anyone
other than the Elections Division.
.Wolosik said that the Elections Divi-
sion have no protections against people
using voter registration forms to take
people’s personal information. '

For large registration drives, the Al--

legheny County Board of Elections will
give out one to two boxes of voter regis-
tration forms. Each box contains about
1,500 for-ms, Boscia said.

' . Boscia said they have no oversight or '

training for organizations that run reg-
istration drives.

She added that groups doing regis-
tration drives are told to put a group
name on each of the registration forms.
When student groups hand deliver the
registration 'forms,,they are asked to ﬁll
out a form with the approximate count
of registrations they are turning in for
processing. . — -

The Student Vote Coalition and ReEn-
ergize the Vote were some of the organi-
zations on campus that handled many
students’ registration forms, but it ‘is
not possible to trace who registered the
phantom voters.

Alexa Jennings, SGB governmental
relations chair and head of the Student
Vote Coalition, saidthe voter registra-
tions‘ forms they used during tabling and
canvassing were recorded.by partner or-
ganizations, such as ReEnergize the Vote
and PennPIRG.

LE'I'I'ER TO THE EDITOR

To the Editor,

I am writing in response to your two recent
“articles on the drilling in the Marcellus Shale
and students’ involvement. While I’m happy
to see The Pitt News reporting on these is-
sues, you are essentially lying by omission and
misinforrning your readers by not discussing
the statements from both the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection and
the industry.

The DEP secretary’s statement in yester-
day’s article that fracking ﬂuid has never come
back to groundwater (and, implicitly, that drill-
ing is safe) may be true, but there have been
numerous examples ofboth fracking ﬂuid leak-

‘ ing at the surface as well as gas‘ migrating to

groundwater due to poorly cased wells — and
these are impressively serious- risks.
- Similarly, the industry statement that the

fracturing ﬂuid used is greater than 99 per-

cent water and sand is accurate, but we don’t

measure human health risk with percents, we
measure it by parts per million —— and even 0.5
percent is‘5,000 ppm. That’s not to mention
the huge amount of salts, heavy metals and
other contaminants that come back up with
the water during ﬂowback — which make up
5 percent or more of the total volume. Whether
through leaks, dilution or (most egregious)

dumping, that’s a lot of things we don’t want ’ p

to be drinking —— even at greater than 1 per-
cent.

Certainly there are misrepresentations on _,

both sides — but “balancing” spin with spin
in an ‘article accurately informs no one. You

owe it to readers to either explain or provide ,

resources which help people accurately learn
about and discuss these issues. ~

Sincerely,

THAT'S »WI'IA'I' SHE SAID

File sharing is fact  music industry should evolve

Caitlyn Christensen
Columnist

As a generation, we’ll take anything we can
get if we don’t have to pay for it. Recognized
or not, it’s a principle that guides many of
our life decisions, be it booty calls — why
buy the cow if the milk is free? — or dress-
ing up in tin foil to snag a Chipotle burrito
on Halloween. Downloading music off the
Internet isn’t any different.
This week, a Minnesota woman was the
ﬁrst person convicted in the federal crack-
down on illegal downloading. Aftertwo trials,
a jury found Jammie Thomas-Rasset guilty
of willful copyright infringement for illegally
sharing 24 songs online in April 2006. The
jury found her liable for $1.5 million in copy-
right infringement damages to the record
companies — $62,500 per song.
But stealing music has become the norm
—. and not only in the United States. Ac-
cording to the Guardian, the International
Federation of the Phonographic Industry, the
association representing the music industry
as_a whole, released a report that 40 billion
songs were illegally downloaded in 2008 —
roughly 95 percent of all music downloads,

/

_ / l and the/same percentage of downloads as

I I

in 2007.

That’s because once many people learn
how to download, it’s hard to stop —- at least
according to CNET.com, a CBS-run site pro-
viding technology news and reviews. Being
able to access thousands of songs with a click

of a button puts music lovers on a power_

trip that’s difficult to quit. For the musical
omnivore, abstaining from downloading
is as difficult as abstaining from cigarettes
or sex.

The ease of having a free musical jukebox
makes music lovers establish guidelines as to
whether they will actually pay for an album.
Some use what I like to call the “Radiohead
Principle”: If a downloader actually respects
a band, he or she might be willing to pay
money for it. Also, the downloader consoles
himself by attending concerts regularly, thus
demonstrating love for a band through both
presence and pocketbook. New principles
of morality are constructed to compensate
for immorality -— there are inherent moral
guidelines which tell us the “right” way to
perform illegal activity. I

After all, paying for music doesn’t seem to
be in our immediate best interest —— no one
really makes a direct connection to getting
caught by the Feds. Pay to download from

iTunes, and the music lover will have to suffer

/ r I /

with asmaller music library to accommodate
his pocketbook, or, worse, have to select in-
dividual songs to download in the event that
he can’t afford a whole album. Doing it the
right way means we would have to reﬁne our
taste and be particular. We couldn’t download
something just for the heck of it, and that
restricts us as music consumers. .

The way the downloader sees it, he can’t
afford the music he’s downloading anyway,
and so the record company cannot truly be
suffering any great loss from individual activ-
ity. Charles Arthur wrote about this for the
Guardian, where he speculated that people
are choosing to spend their money on video
games over records because they provide
more long—term pleasure. It’s rare that you
ﬁnd an album in which you love every track
or an album you can enjoy for weeks and
weeks on end.

It’s an interesting postulation and one
that makes you wonder why prosecutors are
focusing their attention on a single down-
loader. The federal government is seeking
to make an example of Thomas-Rasset,
essentially placing the record company’s
downward spiral in the hands of illegal down-
loaders. Rather than crucifying music fans,
record companies should focus on evolving

 ﬁndinga way to exist in a world where /

downloading will be a reality. More access
to music produces more fans and more
people likely to see their favorite artists in
concert. V

In the meantime, music listeners should
be wary with their downloading: After all,
no matter the convenience, downloading a
record is not the same as holding an album
in your hands — or earning enough cash
to afford the album you love. And the an-
ticipation of waiting for an album’s proper
release date is far greater than jumping the
gun and having it beforehand. Brendan Can-

' ning of the popular Canadian baroque-pop

group Broken Social Scene would agree with
me. Hisalbum was leaked a month early,
prompting him to release the album digitally

__ himself.

“But you know,” he wrote on the site for
his record label, Arts & Crafts. “It won’t be
like going to your favorite record shop and
getting a copy in your hot little hands 
it merely corrects the situation that is 
a messed up version of my record ﬂoating
around on the Internet, and this is not how
I wanted my record todrop.” No liner notes,
no glossy photos, no old-time music expe-
rience. Let’s hope the era of the untainted
album isn’t dead.

Before theannual Pitt Jazz Seminar be-
came an institution of blue notes, modal
scales and offbeat rhythms, it was just
aninvitation to the visiting Art Blakey
and his Jazz Messengers.

“How about you ‘guys come up to
Pitt tomorrow or the next day?” event
organizer NathanlD'avis said tothejazz
legends while he was playing tenor sax
with them ontheir tour stop in Pitts-

burgh in 1970. “Art "turned to his band’

and said, ‘Let’s go up and help Nathan
get started.’” P .h

Forty-one years and 40 official fes-
tivals later, the Pitt Jazz Seminar and
Concert returns ‘with a downbeat’ this
weekend to help bring this American art
form back to the Pitt community.

A Each artist who participates in the
seminar and concert is a significant
force in jazz.

“Each of these guys are handpicked,”
said Davis, who is also the director of
Pitt’s Jazz Studies Program. “That’s
what’s so hard about this kind of thing.
We’re not calling up an agent and send-
ing a group out with one guy who’s im-
portant and three sidemen. Each one
of the guys are major contributors to
jazz.” »

Visiting instructors began giving lec-
tures yesterday and will continue to
do so today and tomorrow. Davis said

to organize the event: “Instead of me
saying what Dizzy did, let Dizzy say
what Dizzy did. That way you can take
away the truth because it’s coming right
from the horse’s_ mouth.”

Beyond the educational factors for
those who focus on musical technique,
the seminars offer an opportunity for
music students to experience something
they can’t get_inside a classroom.

“I want students to experience the
spirituality of the music,” said Pitt mu-
sic professorjames Johnson.

He encourages his students to at-
tend two seminars as part of his African
American Music course, helping them
connect what they’ve ‘been learning in
class to the incomparable experience
of the music itself. ' ‘

s

The seminars feature a variety of
musicians on an equally wide variety
of instruments -— like a tribute to pio-
neering Pittsburgh jazz drummer Kenny
Clarke by Winard Harper or a similar
salute to guitarist Wes Montgomery and
vibraphonist Milt Jackson by two mod-
ern masters at those instruments, Bobby
Broom and Dave Pike, respectively.

Tomorrow at 8 p.m. at the Carnegie
Music Hall, all the musicians who gave
seminars this week will bring their con-
siderable skill to play a jazz concert
together.

In between seminar sessions, some
of theimusicians will share their craft
with the_Pittsburgh community mem-
bers who can’t make it to campus events
through outreach events. '

“We pair one ofthe artists who vol-
unteers with some Pitt students who
qualify,” Davis said. “They go out and
play together at places like the Ronald
McDonald‘ House to people who wouldn’t

otherwise be able to see them.”

Davis also hopes that locals recog-
nize the importance ofthe Pitt jazz
collectiom.

“We have one of the most important
jazz archives in the country right here.
We have 40 years ofvideo and audio of
everyone from Dizzy Gillespie to Sunny
Rollins. The recordings represent the
major people.”

Though the archives represents jazz’s
part, Davis looks forward to Pitt be-
ing a center oflearning that will affect
jazz’s future.

“Check with the people who come
from Japan and Russia,” he said, “one
of the first things they want to see is
thejazz showcase in the Union.

It has Sonny Rollins’ saxophone,

nal stuff and we’ve got it here  one of

last season.

After losing Levance Fields, Sam Young,
Dejuan Blair and Tyrell Biggs — and with
them, 66 percent of the points scored in the
2008-09 season — the Panthers were sup-
posed to struggle.

They were supposed to ﬁnish ninth in the
Big East Conference, at least according to the
coaches in the preseason poll. They deﬁnitely
weren’t supposed to make the NCAA Tourna-
ment.

But Pitt thrives on being the underdog:
the overlooked and unexpected. The Pan-
thers ﬁnished tied for second in the Big East,
with a 25-9 (13—5 Big East) overall record and

‘ But this season, the Panthers won’tbe the
underdogs.

They won’t be overlooked and none of their
wins will be unexpected. That’s because this
season the Panthers return the core of their
team, including four starters and 86 percent
of the scoring. . ,

The Big East coaches picked Pitt to ﬁnish
ﬁrst in the Big East, and it was tabbed as the
No. 5 teaminthe country intheAP preseason
poll.

Pitt senior Brad Wanamaker said the
returning experience should work in Pitt’s
advantage. p

“It’s a great thing,” Wanamaker said. “Last

year we had a whole season where we played

said. “It feels good to have the same group 3,,

back, the same feel. We’re getting ready to  ‘

play a tough season.”

Wanamaker is one of four returning start-
ers for the Panthers. Their leading scorer (Ash-

Pitt deﬁnes versatility

Isaac Saul
' For The Pitt News

Versatility is a characteristic that might be val-
ued more in basketball than any other sport.

A player who can make an impact at difl'er- ‘

ent spots on the ﬂoor is a precious commodity
for a team striving toward greatness. Players
who can extend themselves beyond what’s_
expected of them are tough to ﬁnd.

A forward who can penetrate into the lane
and shoot from 20 feet out; a guard who can
play defense and lead the offense through its
playbook; a big man who can rebound, pass
and block shots; a shooter who can play the
one, two or three spot —— these are all things

‘ a coach prays for. For Pitt head coach Jamie

Dixon, these prayers have been answered.

The Pittsburgh Panthers basketball team
has more than one of these players, and their
ﬂexibility has not gone unnoticed. This fall,
Brad Wanamaker was ranked among ESPN’s
top 10 most versatile players in the country,
and his coach agrees. ‘

“He’s got point guard skills, he’s got good
size for an ofliguard and the plan is for him to
stick in the two spot,” Dixon said. “But things
can change, and he has the ability to play any-
where.” I

And Dixon — who has tied an NCAA Divi-
sion I record with 188 victoriesin his ﬁrst seven
seasons as head coach —— is a reliable source
for recognizing talent.

‘ But the adaptability goes further than just
Wanamaker. ' ‘

Ashton Gibbs, Pitt’s starting point guard,
has proven he can be an efﬁcient scorer. Gibbs
scored 15.7 points per game last year and did
most of it in the clutch for Pitt. In fact, he was
even named Lindy’s Nation’s No. 12 shooting
guard and recognized as USA Today’s BigEast
Player of the Year —— all while running the point
for most of the season last year after being
known more for playing shooting guard.

Just as the versatility extends beyond Wana-
maker, it extends beyond the guards as well. In
his media day press conference, Coach Dixon
spoke a lot about the big men.

“I like the ability our big guys have —— afew
of them can play both the four and ﬁve spots,”
Dixon said. “We have the ﬁve guys, Dante [Tay-
lor], Gary [McGhee], ].J.'[Richardson], Talib
[Zanna] and Nasir [Robinson] really splitting

. those two spots.”

McGhee will be a big factor in Pitt’s suc-
cess this year. Not only can McGhee be a big
‘ rebounding body, but he has also shown that

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

Pitt looks to bounce back

Ben Litringston
Staff Writer

Thereisa gap inthisyear’s Pittwomen’s basketball
team —not a gap in positions, but one in ages.

The team consists ofﬁve seniors, sixfreshmen
and not a single sophomore or junior; meaning
that unless the team recruits a transfer, the eldest
member on the 2011-12 team will be a redshirt
sophomore. ‘

It’s uncommonforateamto have suchamake—
up, and the situation presents head coach Agnus
Berenato with an intriguing set of challenges.

“It’s a greatopporlunityto see howgoodlam
at bringing the old and the new together,” Ber-
enato said at media day. “I haveareallyold house,

. andl justputanewlcitcheninto it, andlreally like
it. So I_thoughtI’dtIyitwitl1the_team.’’ ;.

The Panthers lost all three of their would-
be juniors — Sarah Ogoke,_ Kate Popovec and
Shawnice “Pepper” Wlson) over the off-season
because of transfers, and Pitt’s two freshmen
last year, Ashlee Anderson and Leeza Burdgess,
redshirted. This will create the perfect storm a
year from now, but Berenato said that she won’t
let that affect her approach this year.

“That’s not an urgency,” Berenato said, “For

Lucas Felak I Senior Staff Photographer me, it’s about practice going on right now.”
jania Sims is one of ﬁve seniors on this year’s team’ hoping to lead the Panthers back to

along the development of the six freshmen, who
will be expected to make major contributions
off the bench. For instance, during practices,
Berenato asks each senior to shadow a freshman
who shares their position, rather than simply
work on their own game. '

Ifthe freshmen create a mess, Berenato ex-
pects the seniors to clean it up for her. i

’ 4 “My philosophyisfreshman cause problems,
sophomores causefewer problems, juniors don’t
cause -problems and seniors solve problems,”
Berenato said. “That’s what it comes down to,
and that’s on the court and off the court, and it’s
their responsibility.Asseniors, they need to solve
the problems before they get to us.”

Thatputs plenty ofpressure on allﬁve ofPitt’s
seniors, butBerenatoisplacingthe majority ofthe
weight on guardjania Sims’ shoulders.

Sims hasn’t hadthe easiest college career. She
missedthe second halfofher sophomore season
because of academic ineligibility and sat out all
but one game the following season because ofleg
surgery. But she made a strong retum last year,
and earned an All—Big East Honorable Mention
selection. '

Berenato said that she always saw potential
in Sims.

“I always tell her she has razzle. She has a
little bit of pizzazz,” Berenato  “I said [this]

Wanamaker averaged 12.3 points per game

more and come together as a team.

“I’ve always counted on how great a de-

' Last’ year, McGhee led the team with 6.8 7

“We’re all leaders in our own vtray,” he said.
“Whetherit’stalkingorbeingleaders onthe court

ofleading.”

Throw in players like freshmanJ.J. Moore,
who looks like he can play and contribute right
away, and redshirt freshman Talib  who
scored 13 points and grabbed nine rebounds in
the team’s first exhibition game, the team has
serious potential.

ButGibbs and the  knowthatnobody
is going to hand them atrophy this season.

“Nobody is goingto back down to us,” he

_ said. “[The Big East] is the best conference in

the country. Each and every game is goingto be
a hard-fought game and with the experience we
have, everybody is going to try and come at us

to [Sims] when she came in her freshman year,
and" nobody believed me. She was quiet, she was
introverted. She didn’t speak. Butl told her, come
her ﬁnal year, her senior year at Pitt, she will be
amongthe nation’s best point guards, and I stand
bythat.”

With a sense of humor reminiscent of ‘Ber-
enat0’s, Sims asserted that she’s ready to take the
reins and do Berenato proud.

“Of course, I’m ajersey girl. ‘Me and Coach,
we've gotthatchemistrybecause she’s also ajersey
girl,” Sims said. “Butl dorfttakeitaspressure. The

V team looks up to me, the coaches have conﬁdence V

in me to be able to take that last shot and know
what to do in clutch situations. It’s exciting to be
inthat position.”

Joining Sims as the team’s senior leaders are
Shayla Scott, Taneisha Harrison, Chelsea Cole
and Brittaney Thomas. '

Harrison and Sims tied for the team lead with
12.9 pointslastseason, followedby Scottwith 10.2
and Cole with 9.1 points per game.

With the seniors leading the charge, the Pan- ,
thers will try to rebound from a rough 2009-10"

campaignthatsawthem ﬁnish 5—11inthe BigEast
after making consecutive Sweet Sixteen appear-
ances in the 2007-08 and 2008-09 seasons.

The downturn hitBerenato hard,tothe point
9 where -she used the words “extremely disap-

pointed” three different times during her press
conference following Pitfs elimination from the
2010 BigEast Tournament.

But just as Berenato isn’t dwelling on Sims’
previous struggles, she won’t allow last season
to get to her.

“I dorft want to go back. I’m not even think-
ingabout last year,” Berenato said. ‘Tmlivingfor
today, andI’mlivingforthefutm'e.” ﬂ
