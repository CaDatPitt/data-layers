Professor Morgenthau is con-
sidered by many to be the father

' of modern world politics and is

the originator of the realist
school of international relations.

The realist school contends
that the foreign policy of the

United States should be concern-

Ragtime-—-Music and. History

,Morath Performs at PM  

By LARRY BEBNFELD
Ragtime pianist Max Morath’s music is
like a ﬁne wine. It’s one. of the few com-
modities that improves with age.
Performing before a P.M. series and As-

A sociation of College Unions (ACU) confer-

ence audience last Thursday evening, Morath
and his Original Rag Quartet amused -and
entertained the gathering with ragtime songs from
the turn-of-the-century and a constant “patter”
which pictured life in the good old days.

If a picture is worth a thousand words, Morath’s
magic lantern series of color slides would ﬁll a
Sunday New York Times with the information and

humor they added to the evening’s musical program.

Expands Style
Morath, who gave a one-man show for a P.lVL au-

dience last year, expanded, his program and style -

to ‘include three other ﬁne musicians who, along
with Morath, make up the newly-formed “Orig-

inal Rag Quartet."

Bearded Barry Knrnfeid plays guitar.“ ave
string banjo and harmonica with the group.
Jim 'I3’1er. Sporting. a Vandyke beard and head

V of very long black hair, adds a. sterling tenor banjo

to the quartet. _ _ -
Playing the guitarron-, . a. huge guitar developed?
by the wandering Mariachi bands of Mexico, Felix

Pappalardi ﬁlls out the foursome with his instru-

ment’s soft bass sounds;
-. Morath hezan thellrotram with “Dill Pickle

Bax.” a, 1:906 number featuring the tlnklinx rep- ' ‘

Spitalny and his orchestra, the
Ames Brothers, Barbara McNair,

Robert Mosley, The Three Houcs,
Manhattan Rockets, and a Holly-

perform at the rally.

Admission is by ticket only. The
Pitt Young Republicans (YR’s)
have received 150 free tickets,
which are available to students
in 511 SU._ The YR’s will sit in a
special 500-seat section with col-
lege students. from the tri-state
area. " ’ ‘ I

etition at three notes moving through a progres-
sion of chords. This number has been recorded on
a 45 r.p.m. single by Epic Records.

Scott Joplin’s “Cascade,” written in honor of
the World’s Fair--St. Louis, 1906, featured. Morath
on the piano backed up by soft strings. When Mo-
rath soloed in the middle of the number, the other
musicians froze in position with their instruments
in hand as if. they were posing for a turn-of-the

,ce_ntury family portrait. ,
Choosingva. song‘ from “the zoo school ofdances” i

which featured numbers such as the “Turkey Trots”
with words explaining how. to do the dance, the
quartet played and sung “Thepcubanola Glide.”
Shortly before the intermission, Kornfeld, Tyler,‘
and Pappalardi left the stage to Morath. He was
back in his true element——a one man show.
Providing, .a piano accompaniment to his magic
lantern slides, Mora-th gave captions toa series of
pictures. A slide depicting ,a group of. stiﬂ’, proper

people sitting at a- restaurant table won the‘ au-;

dience's approval with Morath’s caption--“A young
college couple setting  ohaperones stoned.”
The audience joined in on a» magic lantern sign-

 Down With Meter Maids
Parking Problems

By BOB SMIZIK
 They came in the night. At least they weren't there
one afternoon and they were there the next morning. What

 

 

__to the curb and one parallel to it. Someone said they had
‘xgsomething to do with parking but I didn’t believe it.
 _ After all, why would anyone paint zones in which to
 . park. ‘There s -barely enough room to park around here as
.9 is. What sense would there be to making peoplepark with-
. in a white rectangle. .

But then the idea was explained to me. Someone said
it was a money making idea on the
part of the city of Pittsburgh. I
couldn’t believe that either. After'all,
the city of Pittsburgh makes so much
money on other taxes and other
4 things. Why would they need to make
;_ money off us poor students.

 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
  

. But then the idea was explained
 further to me. I was told that the
f poles out of the ground on Bigelow
‘ Boulevard and Fifth Avenue have
 something to do with it. It seems

* these poles are only stems for some-

I BOB snnzm thing horrible-—a parking meter.

 YES, THAT IS the fate of all Pitt students. It seems
 -. the city fathers are convinced that persons are parking in
Oakland and taking the streetcar downtown to work. They
 want to foil these people by putting in parking meters. They
 apparently feel that only a small minority of the parkers
(1 7 are students.

 _ They ought to come around here some afternoon around
" .4 pm. and that would open their eyes. There are a multitude
of spaces. All of which proves that most of the spaces are
taken up by students who leave here between 3 and 4 p.m.
and not by office workers who wouldn't hit Oakland until
15:30 p.m. or so.

9, Let's examine these parking areas. First of all why do
 they come in pairs. They have two and then there is a space
and then two more etc., etc. Why the space? Why can’t
these parking spaces run back to back. This is ridiculous.
 Just another means of cheating students out of parking
‘area.
*' What about the meters themselves. We understand they
~ will be one and two hour meters. But you can only stay in

  

  
 
 
 
 
   

 
 
 
 

  
  
 
  
   
  
  
  
  
 

 other words, if you put four nickels in a meter for two
 hours and come out two hours later and put four more
 nickels in you are liable for a ticket.

- WHO IS CHECKING on this? Meter maids, that's who.
These dames get me sick. Someone named Margaret Jones
3‘ nabbed me last week. Here I was parked in a one hour park-
. ing zone on Forbes Avenue for four hours. I had been park-
 there for weeks. And then this Jones woman comes along
: and hits me for ﬁve bucks.

, Now don't get me wrong. I’m not upset about this park-
- ing situation because of a lousy ﬁve bucks. That’s small

What about the students, unlike myself, who can’t af-
ford ﬁve bucks. What about the students who are going to

To The Left- March

By IRV GARFINKEL

While working for an overwhelming
defeat of Barry Goldwater, all those who
agree that President Lyndon Johnson’s
program is inadequate must continuously
say so. A concentration on the latter can
also contribute to the former by indicating
that the relevant political discussion on
. . . , 20th century prob-

lems lies to the left
of President John-
son. Goldwater is
thus placed where
he belongs-——on the
fringe. And ‘if a so-
ciety can solve its
problems, it needn’t
worry about fringe
elements. In a series
of articles I will
consider the propos-
GARFINKEL als of individuals

and groups who are to the left of J ohnson.
Senator Joseph Clark of Pennsylvania,
a loyal Democrat actively campaigning for
President Johnson, continues to advocate
policies that are fare to the left of the pre-
sent Johnson program. On October  of
this year, Sen. Clark introduced a piece
of legislation dealing with the problem of
full employment. Unfortunateliy, his pro-
posals received scant attention in the news
media. Yet the proposed legislation, the
result of several months of hearings con-
ducted by the labor subcommittee on em-

 

ployment and manpower, offers a concrete '

way of winning the war on poverty and
beginning to build the “Great Society.”

SINCE NOT ONLY Clark’s proposals,
but those of the other men I will discuss
in future articles, arise out of the findings
of the subcommittee on the extent of our
“manpower revolution” it is necessary to
brieﬂy recapitulate these ﬁndings. Though
employment in industry rose three quar-
ters of a million each year during the ten
year period 1947-1957, from 1957 to 1963
employment in industry actually declined
by 300,000 despite an overall increase in
output. During this six year period, of the
total increase in non-farm employment of
4.3 million, only 300,000, or an average of
50,000 a year, of those jobs were supplied
by the private proﬁt-making sector of the
economy.

In order to merely keep unemployment

   

Letters To The Editor

from rising we would have to create 3.5
million new jobs annually through 1970.
To reduce unemployment to a three per
cent level by 1968, we would have to create
six to eight million new jobs every year.
When we compare the ﬁgures of what is
needed to the ﬁgures of the actual per-
formance of of the private sector of the
economy 1957-1963, we can see the start-
ling dimensions of the problem.

The subcommittee majority consisting.
of Sens. Clark, McNamara, Pell, Kennedy,
and Metcalf stated that on the most fav-
orable assumptions it will take an annual
$5 billion increase through 1968 in fed-
eral spending on public works to reduce
unemployment to three percent by 1968.
They also advocated reactiviating the 1946
employment act. But the majority was too
timid to call for national planning. The
minority on the other hand criticized the
majority report for advocating guided
capitalism. So it was the minority that
made explicit what was implicit in the ma-
jority report.

NOW SEN. CLARK has concluded that
the only way to achieve full employment
is to institute national economic planning.
He proposes that the President submit to
Congress every year a national production
and employment budget and full employ-
ment federal budget. The former would
describe where the economy is as opposed
to where it should be in order to achieve
full employment; While the latter would
stipulate the short and long range pro-
posals designed to remedy the situation.
Congress, by debating the budget as an
integrated whole, would be responsible for
making national economic policy.

Planning in the form of monetary,
taxation, and expenditure policies has in

countries such as Sweden, France, West‘ 0

Germany, and Japan maintained a high
level of production and reduced unemploy-
ment to -below two per cent. Sen. Clark be-
lieves that proper planning can do the
same for us.

Yet many intelligent and responsible
men believe that because of automation,
full employment in the U.S. is now impos-
sible. Hense, they argue, it should not be
a goal. Before evaluating Clark’s proposals
it is necessary to consider the arguments

More Responsibility Sought

 for the length of time they are designated for. In '

Editor, The Pitt News:

This letter is prompted by the
editorial that appeared in The
Pitt News of Monday, October 19,
and even more-so by the actions
which initiated that editorial. As
an individual who has long been
advocating increased student re-
sponsibility on the Pitt campus,
I am delighted to see that other
students are activehr working in
that same direction and meeting
with enthusiasm and support for
their ideas from the University
administration.

The request presented to Hous-
ing Board in regard to off cam-
pus housing and removal of cur-
fews for senior women has a
much greater merit than the
necessity for these single changes
in policy might demonstrate. The
question which they raise is far
more basic and is pertinent to
the specific commitment this Uni-
versity has to the goals its Chan-
cellor outlined for it almost eight
years ago. The necessity for ac-
cepting student responsibility as
a vital goal for a modern Uni-
suggested that in addition to its
versity was a necessity fully out-
lined by Dr. Litchﬁeld when he

tudes, his emotional maturity.”

The object of imparting posi-
tive values and emotional matur-
ity carries with it the require-
ment of giving students respon-
sible positions in society through
which this imparting can occur.

If a University wishes to see
it must give them social responsi-
bility‘ just as it must provide in-
tellectural responsibility if it
seeks to aid students’ intellectual
development.

A University cannot assume
that a sterile intellectual world
where the student has no re-
sponsibility for his own growth
will yield a graduate prepared to
cope with the problems of the so-
ciety into which he will be
thrown.

In the same fashion we cannot
assume that students who have
lived only by rules and whose
growth has been measured by

their compliance with those rules

The

 

will be able to live well adjusted
adult lives‘ where rules will have
to be imposed internally rather
than from without.

This is not to say, however,
that a University must refuse to
assume any role in .a student's
growth process. I would be less
likely to request responsibility
for a freshman woman as I would
be to demand that responsibility
for a senior woman.

I speak not only for myself,
but for the entire Student Union
Board when I welcome the cur-
few proposal with great respect.
We join our votes with those of
many other Pitt students, faculty,
and administrative members in
desiring a renewed commitment
to the goal of educating the Pitt
student as a whole person.

KEY PLAYERS  

WHEN FRED MAZUREK was removed-in, favor of Kenny"

Lucas in the second half of Saturday's football game with
Navy, he had completed ﬁve passes out of eight and
had carried the ball seven times for 23 yards.

It is a tribute to Mazurek that he did "that well with
the entire Navy team keyed to stopping him. Mazurek
is the best quarterback on the football team. He always

moves the team well, especially with the defense keyed‘

to him.

Fullback Barry McKnight and halfback Eric Crab-
tree both played strong games offensively because the

defense concentrated on Mazurek. These backs are less -

of a. threat when Mazurek is out of the game.

ROGER STAUBACH PAID Panther linebacker Marty

Schottenheiiner the highest tribute that can be accorded a
defensive ballplayer when he said, “Number 50 always
seemed to know what I was going to do. Sometimes I,
thought he was calling our plays.”

Eric Crabtree might be the Panthers’ best defensive
back. The Navy coaches in the press box who were
watching Pitt’s pass defense kept yelling. “Whatever
you do, don’t throw to Crabtree’s side. Don’t throw to
Crabtree’s side.” Most of the passes Roger Staubach
completed were to the other side of the Panther defense.

SCHOT'l‘ENHEIMER SUMMED up the game when he said,
“We matched them, mistake for mistake.”

Cubs Show Flashy Plays
But Lose to State, 18 — 12

By TOM SACKS
The freshman football team’s ﬂashy scoring wasn't
enough to counteract its glaring mistakes in the 18-12 loss
to Penn State Saturday morning at Forbes Field.

In the waning moments of the
third quarter and in the fourth,
the Cubs rallied from an 18-0
deﬁcit to score two touchdowns.
In order to keep their momen-
tum moving the freshman need-
ed possession of the ball. Twice
the Cubs forced State into punt
formation,- only to commit a cost-
1y penalty.

Late‘ in the third period,
trailing 18-6, the Cubs held
the Lions to ﬁve yards on three
attempts rushing. A roughing
"the kicker call on the ensuing
‘play gave State a ﬁrst down.

Midway through the ﬁnal quar-
ter, trailing 18-12, the Cubs again
forced Penn State into punt for-
mation. The detensive line jump-
retain-

- “u‘.‘<:~—a::.\~ -i.»..m an-_;.1az.-.:

The Cubs’ two scoring plays
caught the Lions ﬂatfooted. With
a ﬁrst down on the Penn State 40
yard line, Mike Elliott ﬁred a pass
to end George Hawryluk down to
the 30. Hawryluk lateraled to
Gearld Rife, who had been pac-
ing the play, and Rife sprinted to
the end zone, untouched.

On the ﬁrst play in -the fourth
quarter,- the Cubs had a fourth
down and 20 yards to go situation
on the‘ Lion 38. Taking the lateral
from quarterback Bob Bazylak,
Jim'C.atone on the halfback roll-
out option passed to Hawryluk in
the end zone.

The Cubs’ nemesis was full-
back Roger Grimes, who gained

Duel Between Quarterbacks i

Fails To Fully  Materialize

The personal duel between
«Fred, _Mazurek and Roger
Staubach never.8'£)t a chance

to; fully develop Saturday at .
the Stadium where the Pan-‘

thers_ and Navy played to a

" 14-14 tie; ~

Apparently ‘under orders

not to carry the" ball as much ‘

as he had in the past, Ma-
zurek handed off to Eric
Crabtree and Barry Mc-
Knight much more than he is
used to and gained only 23 yards
rushing for the afternoon.

But even if -he had been
carrying the ball _more Mazurek
still did not get a. full oppor-
tunity to match Staubach --
college football’s outstanding
player, in 1963.

Coach John Michelosen felt
compelled to give Kenny Lucas a
shot at moving the team in the
fourth quarter when the Pan-

thers were striving to break a tie -

which had existed since the ﬁrst
half. r

“We wanted Kenny in there
because he is a better passer,”
Michelosen said, apparently for-
getting that Mazurek completed

Little Booters
Beat Rockets;

It was a complete reverse of
the West Virginia game two
weeks ago, as the Freshman soc-
cer team defeated Slippery Rock’s
Junior Varsity, 2-1, last Wednes-
day at Kennard Field.

“There was a complete about
face in the team’s complexion,”
said frosh coach Bob McNulty.
“After the West Virginia game I
felt there was a feeling of apathy-
on the team, but the boys show-
ed their spirit against Slippery
Rock.

“It was if they were a com-
pletely different team. They were
more aggressive and controlled
the ball well, and really had a
tremendous day.”

Gary Foertsch, a left wing from
Monongahela, scored, the booter’s
ﬁrst goal on a set up across from
Pete Snyder. George Nemeth, a
sophomore right halfback, scored

ﬁve of eight passes in the second
half and that his percentage of
completions last year was an ex-
cellent 58.

All the scoring for the Pan-
thers was done in the ﬁrst
quarter. Crabtree set up the
oneyard scoring plunge by Me-

ﬁrst time the Panthers got the
ball and minutes later a dis-
puted play gave McKnight a.
two-yard score.

line from where it took the Pan-
thers three plays to score.
Navy coach Wayne Hardin said,
“I asked everyone on my team if

said they did. I think‘ it should
have been our ball on the two
yard line, not Pitt’s. You can’t
fumble if you don’t touch the
ball and our boys say they didn’t
touch it.”

That proved to be the big break
for the Panthers as Navy came
back for 14 points in the second
quarter including a Staubach to
Skip Orr two point conversion to

Knight with a 50-yard rnnithe-—

A Pete Billey' punt was fum- - -

they touched the ball and no one _

tie the game at 14-14.
The rest of the game was a

‘defensive battle. The Panthers’

top defensive battler was Marty
Schottenheimer. Seemingly in on

every Pitt tackle, Schottenheim- .

er drew praise form Staubach.
“That number 50 is a_ helluva

football player,” the Middie quar-. '

terback said.
It was not just a one man
defensive show by the Pan-
thers, though. Mitch Zalnasky
broke through to block a Navy
-ﬁeld goal attempt and captain
Ray Popp almost matched Schola-

tenheimer’s amazing Derform— _ ,_

ance.

Hardin felt the same way about
Staubach. “Staubach was su-
perb," Hardin said. “Being able
to hold up the way he did was
excellent.” Staubach played his
ﬁrst full game of the season and
completed 12 of 20 passes, while

being checked on the ground by '

the Panthers. ,

Mazurek completed ﬁve of ten
passes and had a total offense
of 78 as compared to 77 for Stau-
bach. Staubach had an advantage.

halfback George Sommer, “and it
hindered our offense. We couldn’t
pull our switches (when a wing

just corner us on the sides.”

Wolverine Field measures 95

Defense,

Field Upend Booters

By BILL CABIN

GROVE CITY, Pa.—GroVe City‘s gang defense and fast
break proved too much for the Panther soccer team as
Grove City downed the booters 6-3 last Friday on the nar-
row conﬁnes of Wolverine Field. r

The narrow ﬁeld facilitated the Wolverine’s attack, and
harassed the booter’s offense. “It was a small ﬁeld,” said

ﬁeld and that it would present
problems, but we had beaten
them on that ﬁeld before. Our
boys just didn’t have enough
width to maneuver well. I
They always use a gang de-
fense on that small ﬁeld, drop‘-' '
ping eight’ or nine men back
around the goal and making it
difficult to penetrate.

_“Since we were able to con-
trol the ball the ﬁrst half,” said
Bemis, “I didn’t feel there was
a need to change our style. The
problem was that we were unable

to hit on several well-placeifl

shots. We should have had at
least three or four more goals in
