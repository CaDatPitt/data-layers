STUDENTS WILL ACT

The historical play, which is to be
one of the features of the one hundred
and twenty-ﬁfth celebration ‘of the
founding of the University, is well
under way, and will soon be in such

shape that a.call will be made for the

‘students to come out and try for
places in the caste. ‘
‘ Dr. Ullman gave out some general
facts about the play when asked for a
statement this week. Dr. Ullrnan 
the faculty representative who is co-
operating with George Siebel of the
Gazette Times in getting the play in
shape.

“Mr. Siebel is preparing the play
himself,” said Dr'.«Ullman. “He has
been at work on the play now for sev-
eral weeks ilnd a general outline of
the play will soon be ready for pub-
licati'on.”

Regarding the general character, and
structure of the play, Dr. Ullman
made the following statement: The
play will be in the form of an allegory
and will be interspersed with tableaux.
The history of Pittsburgh and the his-
tory of the University, will be inter-
woven. “She VVho Knows," an old
Indian woman who gives potions to
all those who visit her, is the central
ﬁgure of the play; The scene is laid

. in the eighteenth century and those

In resigning Mr. Wettach made the
following statement to explain his ac-
tion: “Being on last year’s' debating
team and desiring to take part again,
I am urged by the members of the
team that I would do betteron the

debate than on the Owl work‘. I could"

no-t do both. .I am not adapted to
Owl work and cannot enter into it
with the proper spirit necessary to
such work. Besides, there‘ are other

CHANCELLOR OUTLINES  

ANNIVERSARY PLANS

 

College and University Presidents Wﬂl Attend Conference on
Third Day of CeIebration——Pitt Alumni Banquet

To Be Held on Anniversary Day

Chancellor McCormick, when inter~
viewed on the progress of the plans for
the one hundred twenty—ﬁfth anniversary
celebration, gave out this statement:
“Matters are moving along as rapidly
as possible for the celebration of our
one hundred twenty-ﬁfth anniversary on
February 27, 28 and. 29. Formal invita-
tions to institutions are going out this
week, and those’ to individuals will be

‘mailed at a later date.”

In regard to the entertainment of the
college and university presidents of
Pennsylvania at the celebration the
Chancellor said-:

“The college and university presi-
dents of Pennsylvania will be the guests
of the University on the third day of
the celebration. The University intends
to have as their guests on that day every
college and university president in the
state, just as far as it is possible for
them to be there. Also on this day the
representatives ‘of ' the various high
schools and colleges of the western part
of Pennsylvania will be the guests of the
University.”

. ' I

When asked what the plans were for
the opening day of the celebration and
for the formal program on the actual
anniversary day, February 28, the Chan—
cellor said: I . .

“The program for these two days are
in process, and work has been going on
along this line for a considerable time.
However, at this time they are not yet
ready for publication. It is not likely
that they will be in shape to be an-
nounced for several weeks yet, as it is
desired that they be complete in every
detail before they are given out for pub-
lication. ‘ ,

“However, it is certain that the ﬁnal
number on the program for the 28th
will be a great banquet given by the
Alumni of Pitt. At this banquet the
Alumni will have as their guests the rep-
resentatives of the various institutions. '

“I cannot say,”' concluded Chancellor
McCormick, “just how far the historical
play being prepared by Mr. Siebel is ad-
Vanced, but it is likely that a general
outline of the play will soon be ‘ready for
publication.” I

The society very kindly ex-
tended~this invitation. through Prof. R."

‘TEST FOR GOVERNMENT A ..

OF FIBER RAIL SEATS

Mr. Floyd Rose, of the class of ’o2,

\ has recently completed a test for the
, government of ﬁber rail seats. These
‘seats are of the kind used in the Panama

canal zone by the Isthmian Canal Com-
mission in their construction work.
The seats “sweat” and the moisture in-
creases the conductivity. The govern-
ment is endeavoring to coat these with
a substance that will make them non-
hydroscopic. These were coated with a
substance called “Minerallac,” which, it
is claimed, impregnates the ﬁber to a

-certain depth and prevents absorption of
» any moisture.’ ,

Mr. Rose completed the experiment
with the very best results. It was com-
pleted in the laboratories of the Univer-
sity, which Mr. Rose said were the most
efficient and modern apparatus in this

I district.

The experiment was made in the pres-
ence of R. S. Dallzell, government rep-
resentative; S. R. Zimmerman, presi-
dent of the U. S. Asbestos Co.; Chester
L. Hill, vice president of the U. S. As-

bestos Co.; R B. Montgomery, repre-

sentatives ‘of the Dlewary ‘Hard Fibre
Co.; Mr. Aschman, electric engineer;
Oliver Iron & Steel Co. The test was
conducted by Mr. Rose, associated with
Mr. J. H. Schackne, E. E. of the Floyd
Rose & Co. of inspectingand.‘meta1lur-
gical engineers.

(Continued from Page 1)
The trip through the plant started oii
on schedule time. After an hour’s trip

‘through the rod,‘ wire, fence and nail

departments the visitors weer met by a
Special Interworks train and carried to
the next point of interest, which was the
engine and machine shops and the 18-
inch continuous mills. By this time it
was noon and the works train carried
them again to the center of town. From
here they were shown through the oﬁices
and laboratories of. the company.

At ‘the luncheon the Cambria Com-
pany showed themselves to be royal en-
tertainers, in the lunch that they had
had provided for the visitors by the
Ladies Aid Society of the Methodist

.Church. At each place a carnation was

placed‘, and each plate was already filled
so that the hungry engineers wasted no
time in appeasing the hunger generatei
by their morning’s walk. The menu
follows: ' ,

Roast.Turkey. Cranberry Sauce.

Mashed Potatoes. Gravy. ,
Celery. Olives. * Pickles.
Hot Biscuits. Assorted Jellies. ,
Cake. Coffee. Smokes.-

After dinner followed speeches. Dr.
Riddle, ’92, President of the Engineers
Society, and an alumnus of Pitt, thanked
the Cambria Company for their great
kindness extended to the members" of
the society on this and other occasions
Mr. Price, the President of the Cam-
bria Steel Company, responded, and was
followed by .Mr. Waller, the General
Superintendent of the Cambria Steel
Company. This excellant, meal was
served on the fourth floor of the Penn
Traffic Company, which is the largest
department store in Johnstown. This
company was complimented by many of
the visitors on its facilities for handling
such a large crowd.

The rest of the afternoon up to 4:oc
P. M. was spent in inspecting the rest
of the plant. At 4:10 the" special train
left for home. At the Johnstown depot
the returns from a number of the foot-
ball games was received. Iust before
the train pulled out the visitors lined up
by the train and some old cheer leaders
lead them «through “three times three
for the Cambria Steel Company.” On
the way back alumni of many schools
got together and sang again the songs

of their alma mater. The hospitality of ,

the society did not end even here, how-
ever, as they served to all who wanted it
ginger ale and cakes. On the way in a
collection was taken up for the Ladies
Aid Society, which served the dinner
for the Cambria Company, and on the
ﬁrst round $74.80 was collected, but this
in a few moments was raised to $100
and remitted ‘to the treasurer of the
Society.

MEDICALS ORGANTZF SENATE.

The Medical School is at present
organizing a student senate which
shall -be for that department, as the
various senates of the other depart-
ments of the school are to their de-
partments. It is expected that the
election of officers will take place next
week and that this new senate will
take its place at’ once along with the
other schools of the University.

SCIENCE cL_UB ‘MEETS.

 

Discusses Value of Latin and Greek
as Cultural Subjects.‘

The Science ‘Club on Friday, No—
vember 24th, heard Dr. White" on
“The Value of Formal Discipline.”

' The subject is especially appropriate.

at this time as some of our most con--
servative universities are beginning to

i \doubt the wisdom of a strict insistence

on Greek and mathematics as general
cultural studies. The term “formal
discipline” expresses the idea that
training along certain ‘lines ofvmental

_ effort has an inﬂuence on general men-

tal ability.. Thus mathematics is sup-
posed to give practice in reasoning
which will be of value to the students
in other lines as well, and Greek is
said to train a generalmemory power

" which is easily transferable to other

subjects of study. Dr. White showed
by an analysis of the mental processes
involved in these studies that each
brain center develops independently
of all the others and that consequent-
ly a special aptitude for one study
may even imply a deﬁciency in other
The question has" probably

time in his career, as it concerns each
one directly in his work, in and out
of school. The members of the club
showed their interest by a number of

‘pointed questions which brought out
‘well the application of the rule to ex-

isting cases and made the subject ap-
pear in a more important and personal
light than that in which it is often
regarded. _

After the discussion a‘ business
meeting wasiheld and the soﬁicers for
the coming year were elected. The
officers are Jena, ’l2, president, and
Conrad, ’l4, secretary. Any one de-
siring information in regard to the
club's activities may inquire of these
men or any other member of theiclub.

PITT" ORGANIZES NEWICLUB.

 

Social Service Association Has Been
Formed to Interest Students.

 

Pitt is -to have a new. organization
added to its list. It is to be known as
the Social Service Association of the
Univers-ity—of Pittsburgh. Its purpose

_will be to. bind together those already
‘engaged in social service, to interest

others, and to acquaint all with the
opportunities offered in this ﬁeld.
The association is to be modeled
after the Social Service Committee of
Phillips Bro'oks’ House Association of
Harvard. This organization has be-
tween two and, three ‘hundred mem-
bers of the University, representing
all departments, every year ﬁlling
regular engagements in social service_
while half as many more are con-
nected with periodical forms of it.
Three points are made by the Har-
vard Association: '
1. Any man, if he will, can ﬁnd a
place to invest his special talent, for
the time he can spare it, where it will
ﬁll a large, need otherwise unsatis-
ﬁed. - J
2. Reliability, regularity and sin-
cere interest are the only absolute
requisites,_al.though the largest experi-

-ence and intelligence are unwasted.

3. The satisfaction received is no
less evident than- the service rendered,
and the experience inevitably proves
its worth in later years. _ V

The association here willhave a
secretary who will bring together
deﬁnite students andideﬁnite oppor-
tunities in social service. The demand
for students in social service is ever
on the increase.

A meeting for organization‘ will be
called in a short tirrre. It is hoped
that every studentwho has any in-
terest in social service will beon hand
to give the association an auspicious
beginning.

Attention!  

The ranks having been broken by recent gradu-*
ations, eleven new men are to be recruited from the
various classes of the University of, Pittsburgh, into

‘the University ‘Co. “A,” I8tI1‘In£, in order: that the

membership-of this organization ‘may be brought up

to the required strength.

This company has already won the favorable
opinion _of many by reason of‘ its personnel" and

efficiency.

STUDENT SENATE CONVENED.

 

The Student Senate convened Mon-
day morning at 11:30 with the deans
of the various schools. The chief
topic of discussion was the campaign
to raise $150,000 for the e_rection of
the proposed student building.
Chancellor McCormick presented his
ideas, which, aftensome discussion,
were ‘ﬁnally adopted. . The plants
which will be placed in execution as
s-oon as possible-are as follows:

First, the entire student body is to
be divided by schools, then by classes
and ﬁnally by tens. The ten men
teams will be composed of a captain
or leaderand nine other men. There
are over 1,500 regular students and
each student will be expected to raise
$100. Much competition is expected
between the teams to see who will be
ahead in raising their -amount. Sub-
scriptioncards will be printed which
the subscribers will sign. A publicity
committee has been appointed, which
will keep the campaign before the
public.

THE OWL.

‘According t'o -the statement of the
Junior Owl Board issued this week,

' it will be necessary to assess each

member of the'Junior class aboutﬁve
dollars per man in advance. As stated,
each man would have to pay this sum
It thus becomes a ques-
tion whether the Juniors will pay the
cost of their Owl at the beginning of.
the year or leave the b'ook fail to ap-

'.pear on_account of lack of advance

payments. The new plan of payment
in advance will enable the Owl ‘board
to issue a be-tter book with novloss.
Under the old system, the payment of

, bills was delayed. ‘The plan proposed

‘by the present board will avoid this

» delay. ‘

_ As the board has stated in its cir-
cular, it is absolutely necessary that
-the members of the class pay this as-
sessment immediately. -Every Junior
should show his loyalty by paying this

1 assessment within the next week. ‘We
urge the members .of the class of 1913-

_to «take care of this assessment at the
earliest possible moment.

complete success. It marks the com-
pletion of a long period of successful
work. It signiﬁes thepbeginning of a
great period of expansion and growth.

owL “BOARD APPEALS
TO JUNIOR CLASS

 

At a meeting of .the Junior Class,
November 24, 1911, the following circu-
lar was presented to the members pres-
ent and it was voted to send a copy to
each member of the Junior Class in all
departments 2 V
To all Juniors who.think the Junior

Class ought to publish an Owl this

year: _ '

This is -to explain to you; what must
be done, by all Juniorsiin order to have
an Owl.

At a class rneeting,,some_‘days ago,
itnwas agreed upon, that it ‘was abso-
lutely necessary. for each Junior tr
make an advance payment of $5.50 . I

This will give each Junior two “Owls“
when published and pay for the individ-
ual Junior_ pictures, at the rate of $2.00
per copy for the Owls and the picture at
$1.50. .This is the same as all Junior
classes have paid heretofore. .

We must have this money in advance
because printers'demand either security
or advance, payment. The members of
the board cannot be expected to advance
this security, because the duty of pub-
lishing the “Owl” rests on the class and
not on the board.

Juniors who do not pay this will not
be represented as Juniors, in the Owl.
and if a sufficient number do not pay it
RIGHT AWAY there can be no Owl,
as our printer must be engaged im-
mediately. D

‘We all know how big $5.50 looks to
everyone, but it is either that or no Owl.
It is only once thatlyou will everibe‘
called upon to help publish a year book.
Is this Junior Class going to fall down
on this? What’s the answer?

The answer must come in the form of
payments of $5.50 to the Old Board.

College Juniors pay to F. Brand.

Economics Juniors pay to W. Stam- -

baugh. .
Mining Juniors pay to P. Simpson.
Engineering Juniors pay to C. Dill.

The Alma Mater.

~Editor Pitt Weekly:

Last we-ek an article appeared in
the Pitt Weekly censuring the Stu-
dent Senate in humorous terms for
failing to adopt as the University
“Alma Mater” the song entitled. “Our
“Old Pittsburgh," to the tune of
Heidelberg.” The following letter
will show the attitude of the Student
Senate in the matter: ‘

“November 20, 1911.
“Mr. John O’Connor, Secretary,
“The Alumni Council.
“Dear Sir: '

“In reply to your communication
regarding the adoption of an ‘Alma
Mater,’  would ‘say that the Student
Senate considered the s=on_g which you
proposed and, while favoring it in»
general, found some difficulties with
it which seemed to warrant d-eferring
action until a later meeting. The mat-
ter was consequently laid on’ the
table. ' I

“I might say that the principal ob-
jection stated was that the music was
too difficult for the ordinary student
to sing, embracing, as it does, quite a
wide range and a change of keys.
We believe that an ‘Alma Mater’ song
should be, of all things, ‘singable.’
We have requested the Glee Club to
experiment with’ the piece, transpos-
ing it to a lower key. “vhich they will
probably d‘o for us as soon as the
Thanksgiving Concert is off their
hands. ‘ 0

“When this is done the Senate will
probably take action. -

“Yours truly,
_“THE STUDENT SENATE."

 

Delinquent Officers.
Editor Pitt Weekly:

Dear Sir:-—At a recent meeting of one
of the most prominent societies of this
school, three out of the four officers
were absent. In consequence of their
negligence to fulﬁll the duties of their
office, the meeting was to a large extent
handicapped in its work. Suchconduct
by men responsible for the welfare of
a school organization should not be per-
mitted to pass "without some severe repri-
mand. These men, through their negli-
gence, might well have made the meet-
ing a failure. Such a condition does not
occur very frequently, but some action

should beltaken to prevent any recur-

rence of any similar actions. _ I woulzl
urge the members of the different socie-
ties to adopt rules which will call for
the election of new ofﬁcers when the
officers are absent without excuse. In
this mannerionly can the recurrence of
this negligence sometime or other be
prevented. Please be so kind as to call
attention to this remedy in your columns
Yours respectfully,
LOYAL.

 

The Weekly. .
Editor Pitt Weekly: .

Dear Sir:—As a reader of The Pitt
Weekly, I am taking the liberty to write
to you. I wish to say from what ex-
perience I have had with school publi-
cations that the only method of keeping

The Pitt \/Veekly to its present high

standard is by instituting the competi-
tive system of choosing the editors. »I
have noticed in various issues of the
paper that you are appointing Assistant
Editors. I suppose that these men are
being appointed on account of their
ability. If so, the results from the man
agement of the paper, this yearproves to
be one of the strongest arguments in
favor of a competitive. system. Such re-
sults are ﬁne. The new system would
maintain our high standard.

Yours sincerely,
A READER

The following ode to Dr. Brashear
appeared in the Saturday Critic. It
was written by one of Pitt»’s most
loyal alumni, G. M. P. Baird:

Son of the Toiling l‘.Iany, Brother of ‘

Pilgrim of Starry Trails, far traced

Simple of Life and Aim, Humble in

By Loves that His Heart made warm
and Truths thathHis Soul di-
vined;

Though in -these. Later Years
Tears and the Toils be done,

Though through the Long Day’s Heat
He hath journeyed high and far?

._._:__-

Dr.‘ Sedgewiek, of, the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, addressed the
students at the weekly convocation on
Wednesday.. Dr. Sedgewick is a widely
known sanitation expert, being at the
head of various organizations in. the
United States.

Dr. Sedgewickisaid in part:

“The ﬁrstl duty of every man is to
make an honest living,—the world owes
no man a living. Each person in this
life should be as independent as pos-
sible and hustle for himself, not being
dependent on another for his position in
life.

“There is a higher life than the sim-

ple life of living from day to day,” said

Dr. Sedgewiek, “and this is the life that
should most concern each person.

“The cry of the age is eﬁiciency.
There is much talk of the means that
may be used in the conservation of coal
lumber, and fuel of all sorts, why not
conserve the powers _of man? Steps are
being taken along this line. Germary
considersthis one of the best ways to
gain‘ eﬂiciency, and to gain ‘efficiency is

,to gain the very best. '

“Character is the greatest asset
man can have. It is not what a man
can do,,but what a man is, that counts.
Strength of character never fails to be
of the greatest beneﬁt. ..

“We are our neighbor’s keeper, and
every man should live not so much for
himself as for the good of every one.

“The great aim in, teaching sanitation
is to make men Cable to beneﬁt their
fellow—men._' The course.is not tech-
nical, but is a broad course in public
health with its aim the betterment of
humanity.”

“The call for volunteers to take pant

student body at large. Every one who
has any ability along this line should
turn out and give the play their best
efforts, for it is to be given by stu-

“Auggie” Blair, who refereed a game at

School-Shadyside game at Forbes Field
Saturday. The ﬁeld was in bad shape
due to being frozen hard and covered
with snow, but the game was fast and
interesting throughout.

for P. H. S., but this same dope was
badly upset by the Shadyisde team.

mighty Alle—ghenee burst from the
cheering section that gave great proof
of true Pitt Spirit. V K

Contrary to many adverse predictions
the game tomorrow will be the hardest
ever played between Pitt and her ancient
rivals and Victory ‘may be perched on
the Gold and Blue banner ere the con~
test is over. Much will depend, how-
ever, on ‘the spirit that is manifested in
‘he rooterssection and if every Pitt
man enters into every cheer with all his
heart and with all his strength, the sup-
port will add materially to the chances
of the team. Don’t forget, fellows, that
every man who faces Penn State will

V give all he has to win victory and every
wearer of the ..G0l_d. and Blue owes the

University and Team all he has in the
way of support.

Many who saw the Pitt—State game
last Thanksgiving will remember that
the State supporters quit ‘cold long be-
fore the game was over and much criti-
cism was passed on this point. After

6 the game Pitt men will be proud to Say.

“That was my Team,” and will be

ﬂ

proud of the fact that they gave all they"

had in the way of side line support.

Don’t forget this—-after the whistlehas

blown at the end of the game EVERY-
ONE get into a great, big Alle—ghenee
whether Pitt has won or lost.

VARSITY IN GREAT. SHAPIE FOR
TOMORROW’S' BATTLE
WITH STATE.

(Continued from Page 6)
bination at guards. Bebout is playing
for the first time on the Varsity, as he
was a second string man last year. He
captained the great Pittsburgh High
team of 1909 and is very popular
locally.

Fisher will play center with Lamb,
who played on the Grove City College
eleven last year, as a substitute.

For Pitt,_Captain Lindsay and Wag-
ner will play ends, and a better pair was
never developed’ at the Jniversity.
Lindsay is fast, a sure tackler and a dc—
pendable player on offense and defense.
He will line up against Captain Very of
State and a great duel between these
men-is expected, as Very has nothing on
Lindsay. VVagner has played_brilliantl_v
the whole season and it is a good bet
that State will not circle his end.
“Hube” is tall and heavy, weighing in
the neighborhood of 190, and‘ possesses
wonderful tackling ability. Graves, the
sensational Freshman from the Engi-
neering department, will surely get in
the game and may be depended upon
to give a good account of himself. Big
Jim Stevenson and Ross Feightner will
play the tackles and are sure to show
the goods. The former will play his
last game of football, tomorrow and is
in splendid shape to give his opponent
a gruelling battle. Feightner has broken
up many end runs and blocked many

punts this year and his great nerve and
aggressiveness will prove a stumbling
block to State’s offense. The guards
will be Leahy and either Smith or Blair.
Leahy weighs close to 200 and is fast
and full of ﬁght. His opponent will be
“Red” Bebout. Both Blair and Smith
will play in the game, but it is doubtful
which will start. They are nearly equal
in weight and both are fast and aggres-
sive, but~Blair has had three years of
experience on the Pitt team, which
seems to give him an edge, he played
a ﬁne game at Cornell this year. Smith
is a freshman in the School of Eco-
nomics and played in the backﬁeld at
Bellefonte Academy last year. He has
played in every game this season and
will plove a pillar of strength to future
Pitt teams. “Polly” Galvin will play
center and his punting will be a great
factor in the game. Few people who
saw last year’s game with State have
forgotten the wonderful playing of this
giant lineman, and the game may hinge
on “Polly’s" aggressiveness this year.

“Tillie” Dewar, who is claimed by
many local experts to be the equal of
“Shorty” Miller, will start the game at

quarterback and will put up the greatest,

game of his career, as this will be his
last game of football. “Tillie” is always
in the thickest of the tight and his steady
headwork under ﬁre has won many
games for the Gold and ‘Blue. Con-
nelly, who has alternated with Dewar
during most of the games, will prob-
ably play two of the quarters in the
State game. This is his first year at

Pitt, but he has proved to be the find of
the year and if he ever gets going in
the \open, a rnournful melody will be
played up in Center county after the
game. George Brown and “Roz” Qua;—
ley will hold down the halfback positions.
and “Chuck” Soles will be seen at full-
back, with Kernohan as~his alternate.
George Brown is the best defensive
halfback ever developed at Pitt and is
a steady ground gainer when called
upon to buck the line. He broke down
many forward passes during the Notrc
Dame game and Pitt supporters ‘are
looking for him to play a great game to-
morrow. Charlie Quailey will wear the
Gold and Blue on the football ﬁeld for
the last time tomorrow and hopes to
end his athletic career in ii blaze of
glory. He handles the forward pass
well and also runs the ends to good ad-
vantage. “Chuck” Soles will probably
start the game at fullback, although
Kernohan willvplay in part of the game.
Both of these men have done well in the
games against Notre Dame, Villa Nova
and VV. & J., and are good 'line
plungers.

Gehlert, Campbell, Dillon, Cummins
Ashe and Pratt have played in most of
the past games and may get to face
State. Campbell and Ashe play end.
while Gehlert and Pratt play tackle and
Dillon halfback. The latter did par-
ticularly well in the VV. & J. game when
he took Kernohan's place at fullback.

To get right down to tacks, the
writer thinks that Penn State will ﬁnd
it’ impossible to pierce Pitt’s defense to

the extent of a touchdown and should
State gain a victory it will either be of
a fluke variety or the result of a ﬁeld
goal. The dope handed out on the 
& I. game, and the writer hopes he has
not erred in the State prediction.

SHADYSIDE HANDS DEFEAT

TO PITTSBURGH HIGHS C

‘(Continued from Page 6')

the "second half Wolk, S. S. A.’s right
half back, recovered a forward pass by
Dale Gass and sprinted for a touch-
down. This score seemed to put new
life into theiGold and Blue players and
instead of trying to hold High even they
took the aggressive and did some good
gaining. VVhile their victory, in a way

was a fluke, they outplayed the High"
lads during the greater part of the‘

game and earned the edge.

The particular stars of the game were
Wolk and Matson of Shadyside and

Gass, Meredith and Click of High
School. The ﬁnal score was: P. H. S. ‘
o, S. S. A. 5.
