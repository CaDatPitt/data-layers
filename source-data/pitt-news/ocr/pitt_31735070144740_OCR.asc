‘After snow, slush, wind and
what seemed like endless days

of ‘cold weather,‘ signs of spring-

have ﬁnally started peeking out of
Schenley Plaza, just in time for its
official opening next week.

The park currently features
colorful, overgrown daffodils

made of lights. The ﬂowers have‘.

slowly “grown” over the past
couple of weeks. First, visitors
saw only the stem, then the side
leaves appeared,‘ then the petals.

The electronic ﬂowers will slowly».
come down as the real tulips and

daffodils appear, said plaza man-

_ ager  Grifﬁn, who organizes

the events like the April 1 opening
aswell as maintenance. _ ‘

ceptionally beautiful each sea—.

we prohibit playing even Fris-

The park forbids ‘organized
sports, pigeon feeding, open ﬁres,
alcohol and drug use or any other
act_that would harm the environ-

ment. .

Workers will begin recon-

week. The American—made carou-

Pitt students took a piece of Tan~

Students and community mem-
bers carried water buckets from the
Cathedral of  to Sche_nley
Park Sunday to raise money to bring

clean water to people  in poor

countries. ~

Eric Hartman, the executive direc-
tor of Amizade, one of the event’s
sponsoring nonproﬁt organizations,
said 1.1 billion people in the world lack

‘ access to clean water This means that

3,900 children die per day because of

“That’s a lot of people. It’s hard to

get your head around it,” said Hart—'

people is a sister or brother," maybe a

“It is not possible to identify how to end

“Is malaria correlated with poverty?” and

EDITORIAL —

. Listing race should

be up to doctors

When it comes to health care
for minority patients, Highmark
Inc. has made an innovative yet
slightly radical proposal. The
health insurance company has
started asking its customers if
they want doctors’ race or eth-
nicity listed in their physician
directory. Conducted with an
automated telephone survey,

the proposal raises concerns

regarding racial proﬁling. Some
people, however, support this
act as a measure to reduce health
care disparity. Highmark called
about 3,500 customers thus far
and plans on contacting up to
100,000, according to the Pitts-
burgh Tribune Review.

Highmark chose to conduct
the survey because national stud-
ies reveal that minorities do not
receive the same quality of health
care as white people. The revised
directory would‘ potentially help
minority patients select a doctor
with whom they feel more com-
fortable. According to Dr. Som

No matter the context, race is

ties have lower rates in terms of . ~:i‘;:'

going to the doctor’s. Instead of
relying on a primary physician,
some head to the emergency
rooms of hospitals when they
need medical attention. Assur-
edly, this policy seems slightly

extreme amid our 21st century

sense of political correctness.

But if this plan will truly encour— 

age disadvantaged minorities to
increase their attendance at the
doctor’s office, then its results
will justify its initial impression.

To limit the discriminative A

notion of this plan, perhaps it

would be in I-Iighmark’s best in- j
terest to give doctors the option :

of whether they want their race
or ethnicity listed in the direc-

tory. Those doctors who agree 5
with the real aims of this pro- 1
posal could take advantage of 
its offerings, whereas those who 3
don’t support it wouldn’t have to 1
follow it. There exists the chance 

that none or very few doctors
would list their race or ethnicity,
‘but it’s likely that at least some
would comply.

Aside from supposed dis-
criminative undertones,
critics might say the policy would
unnecessarily categorize doctors.

, If their race is listed, then maybe
their sex should also be marked, 3

for example. There’s some valid-

deals with a difficult subject.

Couch law cramps ‘Burgh living

 
    

by Lewis Lehe
Cola/nnidt

Behold City ‘Council’s recent
commandment: It is now ille-

gal to put a couch on your front
porch in Pittsburgh.

The law sounds ominously like
the climax of an unlikely slippery

. slope argument. Imagine: You’re

talking to some right—wing mili-
tia nutjob about building codes.
“Some basic safety ordinances

; are called for,” you say. And
ity to the critics’ concerns, but L
they forget to take a realistic and 1
holistic outlook on the issue. 
The overall impact of this policy 
shouldn’t be shunned, even if it 

nutjob says, in a fit of paranoia,
“Building codes are ﬁne. But be-
fore long, they’ll make it illegal to
put a- damn couch on your own
front porch!” You throw up your

j hands in_ disgust because the idea
; is so preposterous.

_\X/ell, here we are. -

The newspaper coverage and
the City Council members them-
selves make it clear that the ban
is to prevent couch burning. The
logic is, at first glance, infallible.
But something about it irked me.
So I lit a pipe, put on a tweed

coat, and ruminated all afternoon.
After hours of cold deduction I
came to a surprising conclusion:
You can burn a couch that isn’t
on your porch. Clearly, a porch
couch can be stolen and burned
by someone besides the owner,
but I would submit that the City
Council instead take the radical
step of making theft illegal.

For every infringement on
people’s liberty, the extent of
imposition has to be weighed
against the severity and common-
ness of the problem the infringe-
ment tries to pre—empt. For ex-
ample, we can safely say that the
prospect of desperate crackheads
stealing to get crack, and naive
kids ruining their lives after try-
ing crack just a couple of times,
is severe enough to justify a ban
on crack cocaine. . '

But the couch—burning prob-
lem is not serious. It rarely hap-
pens. Only a dozen or so of the
many thousands of couches that
sit on Pittsburgh’s porches year
round are set afire. Obviously
couch burning should be illegal,
but the act is not especially dam-
aging either. The porch couch

ban is equivalent to putting stop

signs at every single intersection
in Pittsburgh, because statisti-
cally over one year the stop signs
might save a life.

Meanwhile, on
porches form part of a distinc-
tive culture. The weather here is
awful usually, but on sunny days,
I’d rather be in Pittsburgh than
anywhere else. You can stroll
down busy streets and see people
sitting out, sipping coffee, drink-
ing beers and chatting. The beat-
up old porch couches pass from
hand-to-hand over generations
of renters, and provide a charac-
teristic backdrop to these prac-
tices.

Bruce Kraus, Oakland’s coun-
cilman, holds the opposite view.
From the Post-Gazette:

“Rome is burning, and we just
wasted a week,”*he said, shortly
after showing video of a blazing
couch on Semple Street. V

This viewpoint is disconnect-
ed from reality. Oakland is not

couches

burning. All of the damage hap- '

pened in one night, not all week
long. The damage done by couch
burning is also negligible com-

Gandhi's effects given back, India shortchanged

by Hay Thuppal
Calumniat

    
 

Mahatma Gandhi was a man
of few possessions, but somehow
so many of them have found their
way into James Otis’ hands. Otis, a
collector from the United States, is
the owner of several of Gandhi’s
belongings, including his sandals, a
pocket watch and his iconic round
eyeglasses.

Despite possessing such trea-
sured memorabilia, Otis hasn’t re-
ceived any publicity until recently.
He wants to auction the items
through a New—York—based auc-
tioneer. The auction, originally
scheduled for March 4-5, was de—
layed in response to numerous out-
cries against it.

Among the items are Gandhi’s'
eyeglasses, through which he was
given “the vision to free India.”
There is no question that such

objects hold a special place in the
heart of many Indians. According
to a BBC interview with Gandhi’s
great—grandson, Gandhi gave the
items away at various points during
his life. Now that they have resur-
faced, efforts are being made to
bring them back to India.

Indian ofﬁcials demanded that
Gandhi’s personal effects return to
India, and they have vowed to bid
for them, if necessary. They have
also met with Otis in an attempt to
stop the auction and bring Gandhi’s
items back to his homeland.

But upon meeting with Otis,
the t Indian government workers
were baffled by his conditions.
One might expect that Otis would
want monetary compensation.
Instead, he asked that the Indian
government increase spending
on its poorest citizens or cre-
ate an international traveling ex-
hibit about Gandhi that would
feature the items in contention.

During the 19305 and ’40s,

Gandhi was pivotal in the push for
Indian independence from British
rule. His philosophies of nonvio-
lence helped unite a country and
bring about a new age in its devel-
opment. Thus, one could suppose
that India would willingly submit
to Otis’ demands as a means of
bringing a piece of their hero back
home.

But that’s far from the truth
given the reluctance of Indian
diplomats to agree to Otis’ pro-
posals. Though his intentions
with his poverty initiative seem
honorable, the time he’s given to
make such decisions is much too
short. The gravity of Otis’ man-
date and of the items themselves
warrants more time to negotiate,
in the views of Indian ofﬁcials.

Maybe Otis just watched
“Slumdog Millionaire” and was
propelled to make a difference
in the lives of India’s forgotten
people. Maybe not. Regardless of
his motivation, Otis lacks focus

and understanding of the situa-
tion. He has done more to antag-
onize India than actually help it.

Even if India was to spend
more on the developing programs
for the poor, asking for such a com-
mitment from the national govern-
ment is rather foolish. When look-
ing at similar efforts in the past, it’s
easy to see why.

Plans to clean up the Ganges
River in India have fallen incredibly
short of their targets and continue
to be ineffective. The initiative,
started in the late ’80s, was put
into action by the federal Indian
government but has failed to cap-
ture the interest of state and local
governments, rendering it pow-
erless. Clearly, if Otis wants dra-
matic change in India, he shouldn’t
be seeking the aid of politicians.

Perhaps Otis learned that les-
son more easily than expected, be-
cause as it stands, he agreed to stop
the auction in favor of his other
demand. According to The New

York Times, Otis and Indian offi-
cials emerged from their negotia-
tions with a plan to create a series
of events that celebrated Gandhi’s
legacy of nonviolence and included
the items that were to be auctioned.

Although the proposed travel-
ing exhibit will be a memoiial to the
life and achievements of Gandhi,
it also signiﬁes a lost opportunity.
Otis could have used his leverage
to affect change in India. Had he
actually taken the time to deal with
the Indian diplomats and negotiate
a detailed plan, real and meaningful
change might have occurred.

Even though the Indian govern-
ment proved ineffective in the past,
the media coverage surrounding
this story would have guaranteed
the completion of this initiative.
Gandhi still has a strong presence
in India to this day, but Otis could
have turned that energy into a tan-
gible manifestation.

Couch burning, theft, infestation already illegal

Lehe, page 6

pared with the overturned cars,
bus stop collapses and bonﬁres
that people set with trash cans
and wooden debris, not couches.
It is downright amazing what
people can burn when they put
their minds to it. That’s Yankee
ingenuity in action.

Kraus also makes a non sequi-
tur: “One idiot decides to place
an accelerant on the wood of
that porch, and that whole row
of houses could go up.” This is
to say that, if someone covers a
porch in gasoline and lights up a

couch that’s on the porch, then
the porch will catch on ﬁre.

Supporters talk about other
reasons, such as rodents and in-
sects that infest couches. This is a
classic case of a solution in search
of a problem. It’s like people who
argue for lower speed limits be-
cause driving your car fast hurts
its gas mileage, which causes
global warming and terrorism
and supports governments hos-
tile to women’s rights.

No one believes Pittsburgh
suffers from serious rodent prob-

lems, or that any such problems
are due to porch couches. No
one was biting their nails over rat
problems before the Super Bowl.
Besides, the consequences of
vermin infestation fall mainly on
those who possess the couches.
Show me the, upstanding
Pittsburghers who shake their
ﬁsts at fate and cry: “I did ev-
erything right! I keep a clean
household! But my neighbor
has a couch on his porch that
rats use as a springboard for
swarm attacks on my home.”

Those who say porch couches
are a ﬁre hazard forget that this is
only true to the extent that couch-
es in general are ﬁre hazards. The
danger doesn’t go away inside the
house. A ‘couch actually seems
more dangerous inside, where it
is dry, can burn a long time with
no one noticing, and sits among
carpets and other ﬁre—prone up-
holstered furniture. Is a ban on all
couches next? This is a silly, slip-

pery slope. Yet, if you had told -

the average person five months
ago about a porch—couch ban

to stop rioting, she would have
thought you silly then as well.

The important thing about
these complaints —- couch theft,
couch burning, rodent infesta-

—tions, ﬁres — is that they are al-

ready illegal. More people calling
the police, and better police re-
sponse, would solve these prob-
lems surgically.

Sophomores lay the beats and write the rhymes

by Sarah Simkin
Staﬁ’ Writer

All college students have
dreams, some bigger and more
implausible than others. Many
take steps toward achieving them
before they even graduate.

But few have dreams as big as
the members of hip-hop duo See
No Evil. Even fewer have the re-
cordings to back it up before en-
tering their junior year.

When Pitt sophomores Bran-
don Jackson and Johnny Drucker
formed See No Evil last year, they
had bigger plans than making mu-
sic a hobby.

“We mutually came to the
agreement that there’s nothing
important about being here if
you’re not going to be remem-
bered. And if you’re not famous,
you’re not remembered. So we
realized we better do something,”

said Drucker.

The two met the second semes-
ter of their freshman yearat the
fraternity house for Pi Lambda Phi,
where Drucker is now a brother.

Jackson is a master of ceremo-
nies -— or microphone controller,
depending on who you ask — and
raps over the beats Drucker cre-
ates as disc jockey. Jackson’s stage
name, Johnny Knuckles, comes
from the combination of Johnny,

a name he picked for its ordinari-
ness, and Knuckles, which em-
phasizes struggle and hard times.

Drucker’s stage name, DJ Mick-
ey Cake, came from a character in
the children’s book “In the Night
Kitchen” by Maurice Sendak.

“Probably only 1 percent of
our following understands that,
but I like it,” said Drucker.

Only 10 months after fusing
its talents, See No Evil has com-

pleted its debut album, Cellar Door
Dreams. Jackson and Drucker had
a very clear, almost mathematical
concept of what they felt their al-
bum needed before they started
recording.

“Albums have love songs, ag-
gressive songs, fast songs and slow
songs, commemorative songs,”
said Drucker.

Hours were spent attempting
to capture the balance and ﬂow

New bromantic Comedy pits lonesome loser
with hisenew best friend and soul mate

‘by Colleen4Counil1a.n
Staff W/rite/'

“I Love You, Man” I 4 I

Starring Paul Rudd and Jason Segel
Directed tgy John Hamburg
Paramount Pictures

Bromance is in the air. A

Just when the world thought “Bromanc'e”
was only another reality television phase,
consisting of testoste'rone—ﬁlled men ﬁght-
ing for the platonic attention of handsome

’ California dude Brody Jenner, Hollywood

decided it wanted a piece of the action.

“I Love You, Man” is a straight—up ro-
mantic comedy, but the male—female relation-
ship is moved to the background while the
blooming friendship between two men takes
the lead. The predicament reveals itself from
the very beginning. Peter Klaven (Paul Rudd)
and his soul mate Zooey (Rashida Jones, aka

' Karen from “The Office”) decide to get mar-

ried, but they have one problem — Peter has
no friends beyond his brainless, weightlifting
brother, therefore he has no best man.

/.

I.lLi.

‘divorced women, and he. hap-

. ~ for the band Rush.

V/ith relevance to current dating tech-
niques, Peter turns to the Internet to ﬁnd
his male friend match. But when this search
brings him prospects like an old man using a
younger picture for his proﬁle and a gay man,
Peter decides to give up on the “man dates.”

- It is not until Peter, a struggling realtor,
meets someone at one of his open houses

that  begin to turn for the better. Syd- A

ney Fife, played by Jason "
Segel, is a calm and cool ' ‘
Womanizer who‘ only goes to
open houses to meet newly

pens to share Peter’s passion

It seems like a match made
in heaven. Sydney and Peter
spend their days shopping
for tuxedos and jamming to
Rush songs, and Sydney gets the prude Peter
to open up about his sex life, even alluding to
Zooey “returning the pleasure’? to his friend.
The problem is that all this oozing man—love
between new friends makes the new ﬁance
the third wheel.

As expected from director John Ham-

burg, a name behind “Along Came Polly?’
and “Meet the Parents,” the movie does not
fail to make the audience laugh. Rudd’s char-
acter is very  to Ben Stillefs character
in “Meet the Parents,” always trying to please
everyone, but  a complete fool of
himself in the process. .

Rudd plays the lovable idiot well. Inan ef-
fort to sound cool in front of  new fnend,
‘ he uses different nicknames
and slang that don’t make
sense. And he admits with

the best nights of his life
involved Zooey, a summer

I salad, a bottle of wine and

. the movie “Chocolat.” -
' Viewers shouldn’t
pect any new moves from
Rudd, though. His charac-
ter is strongly reminiscent of just about every

CK-

, other character Rudd has played — the calm
and silly type. ‘ -

Segel executes his character, Sydney, with
similar comfort, but sometimes his “cool—

ness” gets a little annoying for an adult man. '

And it might take a couple of hours to get

P

seriousness that one of .

the image of  walking on the beach wear-
ing UGGS out of viewers’ heads.

The unexpected delight was the character
of Zooey. It wasn’t so much that Jones was
a quintessential part of the ﬁlm, as the giddy
yet grounded ﬁance. It was just nice to see
Jones’ ability to conquer a role very different
from ‘the sarcastic  who gets dumped in
“The Ofﬁce” —— the character most people
know her as.

As a whole, “I Love’ You, Man” is enter-
 And it should be, with a star—studded
cast and accomplished comedy wiiters at its
helm. Where it lacks is the plot It’s difficult
to be really enthusiastic about a movie with
its main focus being a man’s hunt for another
man to fall in friendship love.

In recent interviews, Hamburg denies
claims that the movie was inﬂuenced by the
entertainment industry’s new fascination
with “bromance.” He said he hadn’t even
heard of the MTV reality show titled after

‘ the now overused moniker or its front man,

Jenner. Whether Hamburg is telling the truth
or not, this fairly recent idea of matchmaking
as a male friendship tactic is already getting a
little old. ‘ '

Violins, guitars and synthesizers _aren’t
always the smartest of mixes, but some-
times folktronic bands like Efterklang can
"get their quantities balanced in an even
fashion. _ ,

Efterklang’s album,
Parades, hits a sweet note
once people can accept that
the band’s name is a Dan-
ish word for remembrance._
and reverberation, and the
album’s name is plain old
English. Luckily the album
box itself can smooth this
oddball out.

The album is ‘covered
with a bright collage of
building blocks.» Very colorful pathways
and stairs galore lead to buildings that
might as well belong on a child’s play set.
It’s colorful, it’s fun to look at and it in-.
spires smiles with the memories the shapes
might alight.

Does the artwork match the _11 songs,

though?

Well, amazingly, it kind of does. For
“Polygyne” Efterklang uses a violin along
 computer and piano, and completes
the first track with a humming Choir and
harmonizing vocals. This doesn’t mean the
song is meant to have recognizable lyrics
— it soundsla bit like Sigur Ros.

Next up, “Mirador” introduces the

ﬂutes and the brass sitting at the back of .

inarches from speakers

the orchestra and recording room. It’s pret-
ty, and the vocalists continue to harmonize
with theif melody well. Sti1l,it’s a little dis-
appointing to not hear recognizable syl~
lables enunciating their points in time with
the drum. _

Short but fully lived, “Him Poe Poe”
lives up to the “tronic” in folktronic, kick-
ing off with a synthesizer, opening for its

O piano and guitar. Oddly, among the violin

notes there are traces of words — which
might translate into, “For all the world /
they’re ringing now. / Silver bells, / oh the
words they’re singing now.” Of course,
- others might hear
differently.
“HorsebackTen-
ors” might be one
of the most classi-
cally beautiful tracks,
with the plucking of
strings, the singing
of a bow on a vio-
lin and a, long lost
comfortable feeling
that reminiscences
of those years when
everything seemed festively beautiful. It’s
a little weird to hear “Mimeo” right after,
with nothing but a melancholic piano—bass
duet filling the room and begging listeners
to drop a tear for it. Emotionally, these two
tracks are good to mess with someone’s
head. Got it.

At least the album is varied ——- it’s bet-I

ter to hear different emotional levels mixed
in with the instruments than to hear the
same, thing over and overagain. Especially
if listeners really, really want their lyrics. It
probably isn’t going to happen easily — it’ll
take a good car to catch these syllables.
But at least this folk music is not out of
date and impossible to stand — so even if

I the words escape, the chords won’t.

they wanted and determining what order
the tracks, consisting of nine songs and
two interludes, should go in. Both hoped to
craft an album without ﬁller tracks, as op-
posed to the single—driven hip—hop and rap

SCCIICS.

“We did not make a mixtap"e. We did not

make a CD. We made an album,” saidJackson.

They ‘chose the title Cellar Door Dream:
to incorporate dreams with the two words
that many believe to be the most beauiiful
phrase in the English language.

_ “[The album] should be played from
start to finish. At loud volumes. The first
song sounds great after the lastone,” said
Drucker. . .

Though See No Evil is not yet signed
to a label, Jackson and Drucker have been
sending out their album to the labels of art-
ists whose careers they respect in the hopes
of emulating them.

Although their partnership_is integral to

their music, Drucker and Jackson do not
need to be in the same room to work to-
gether. Jackson can record his portion in
his home town of Atlanta while Drucker
works from his home outside of Philadel-
phia. Drucker makes_a beat encapsulating
the emotion the two want, which Jackson
then takes and writes rap lyrics for. They
merge the separate sound recordings later.
Drucker and Jackson were raised with
very different music cultures, but they have
found that they have much in common.
“We can come together because there’s

so much gray area in music,” said Drucker.

Luckily, both had musical and perform-
ing experience before forming See No Evil.
Drucker was a singer and guitarist in a rock
band. ' ’ A .

“My respect for rock has only grown
since I’ve started rapping. I can’t wait until
we’re done working with Cellar Door Dream:
so I can go back to writing other stuff,” he

said. .
_ Jackson has almost one decade of rap
experience since beginning at the age of 9.
Jackson learned to rap from his cousin
Tony, who he said taught him everything he
knows. One of the two memorial tracks on
Cellar Door Dreamy, “Tuffy,” is dedicated to
Tony. _ I
The other commemorative song, “Oli-
ver,” is dedicated to Oliver Hertzel, a" Pitt
student and close ‘friend of the duo’s who
died earlier this year. .
“It’s about him and how he made us think
about our lives, -just generally about what it
meant to us [that he died]. Oliver was our
boy, our biggest fan,” said Drucker.
Drucker taught himself to use an
MPC500, or music production center, to

create his beats by sampling sounds. He _

then adds his own bass and drums, fre-

quently playing guitar over the samples. _

Thanks to his father owning a record label
and a record store, Drucker has more than
10,000 records in his basement from which
to choose samples. '

Drucker described samples as “my own
phrasing with [other musicians’] notes.”

It can take him hours to ﬁnd the right one.

“It’s not a hard thing to do once you find
the right sample, but ﬁnding that sample can

take 25 records. You can turn over every side A

and not find a legitimate sample,” he said.
The ‘chopped but clean beats Drucker

creates through sampling gives his music a‘
distinct style. j .
“You can take sounds that were happy

originally and make them just the saddest

‘thing ever,” said Drucker.

Reﬂecting on their accomplishments so
far, Drucker said, “Last year this was a pipe
dream, and nowAwe’re here. It’s so natural,
it’s not hard to do any of this, and it just
took time. As a life goal, to have _this ﬁn-
ished is pretty cool.” '

  Sheaffer overcomes

injury to earn honors

by Adam Littman
Senior Staﬂ Writer

In order-to become an All—American for
the ﬁrst time in his career, Pitt wrestling’s
Zach Sheaffer overcame not only a loss in his
first round of the NCAA Championships,
but a concussion as well.

The senior heavyweight dropped his ﬁrst
bout of the year—end Tournament held this
past weekend in St. Louis, but won his next
four to make him an All—American. In his
ﬁnal bout, Sheaffer suffered a concussion in
the ﬁrst period against Lehigh’s' Zachery Rey,
but ﬁnished the match, and Tournament,
with a victory.

“It’s a shame he couldn’t wrestle .
[Saturday] ,” said Pitt coach Rande
Stottlemyer.

Because of the concussion, Sheaffer took
a medical forfeit for his last two matches,
but still advanced far enough to earn his All-
American status. This is the third straight
year with an All—American for the Panthers.

“That’s our goal,” said Stottlemyer. “If
you get somebody standing on the podium
at the NCAAS, you’re doing a pretty good
job.”

Pitt ﬁnished the Tournament 38th overall
out of the 60-plus teams competing in the
NCAA Championships.

“It’s very competitive [at the NCAAs],”
said Stottlemyer. “It’s pretty crazy.”

In  opening bout of the Tournament,
Sheaffer faced No. 2 Mark Ellis of Missouri
in a rematch of the ﬁnals at the Midland
Championships from earlier in the season.
Once again, Ellis won, sending Sheaffer to
the consolation bracket.

In another rematch from Midla.nd,
Sheaffer next wrestled Indiana’s Nate
Everhart and won with a 7-1 decision. Back
in December, Sheaffer pinned Everhart for

his 100th career victory.

The senior heavyweight won his next
two matches, including a pin over Dominick
Russo of Rutgers, to set up a bout against
Rey with the winner becoming an All-
American.

After a scoreless ﬁrst period, Sheaffer
jumped ahead in the second, 1-0, on an
escape. Rey also scored an escape point early
in third period to tie it up and send it into an
overtime period. Neither wrestler scored in
the ﬁrst sudden victory period, but Sheaffer
escaped early in the second overtime and
held on for the 2-1 victory.

Sheaffer wasn’t the only Panther to
compete over the weekend. junior Jimmy
Conroy, sophomore Ethan Headlee and
freshman Tyler Nauman also participated in
the Championships.

All three wrestlers advanced past the ﬁrst
day of action, but none placed.

Nauman, who led the team in wins
this season, was the only Panther to win
his ﬁrst-round match, defeating Hofstra’s
Justin Accordino 7-1. Things got a bit more
difﬁcult next as Nauman faced Ohio State’s
J Jaggers, the defending national champion
in the 141—pound weight class.

No. 3 Jaggers defeated Nauman 6-4 with
a takedown in the ﬁrst overtime period on

’ his way to a second consecutive national
title. Nauman then lost his ﬁrst match in the
consolation bracket to Penn State’s Frank
Molinaro to end his season.

“He just wasn’t as consistent as he needed
to be,” said Stottlemyer.

Twelve seconds into his ﬁrst match,
Conroy was pinned by Ohio State’s Reece
Humphrey. It’s the third—fastest pin in
NCAA Championship history. But Conroy
bounced back and won his first match in
the consolation bracket before ending his

Blair named finalist

for Player of the Year

by Mike Gladysz
Sparta Editor

DAYTON, Ohio — Pitt center Dejuan
Blair was announced on Sunday as one
of three players up for the 2009 Naismith
Player of the Year award.

Connecticut’s Hasheem Thabeet and
Oklahoma’s Blake Grifﬁn join Blair in con-
tention for the award, which is in its 40th
season.

Blair, a sophomore and the only unani-
mous all—Big East ﬁrst—team selection this
year, is first in the nation in offensive re-
bounding and fourth in total rebounding.
He split Big East player—of—the—year honors
with Thabeet.

Danger in Dayton

After coming face—to—face with what
might have been its biggest scare of the
season on Friday against East Tennessee
State, No. 1—seeded Pitt knew it needed to
make some major changes on Sunday.

The Bucs had 11 more offensive re-
bounds and 18 more second—chance points
than Pitt did on Friday, nearly giving the
Panthers an early Tournament exit.

But Pitt turned it around on Sunday,
outrebounding Oklahoma State by 14 on
the offensive side and by 20 overall. Those
offensive rebounds led to 21 second-

chance points for Pitt, 14 more than the
Cowboys had.

Pitt, Dixon and Young reach for re-
cords '

Pitt, which improved to 30-4 on the sea-
son, has now won 30 or more games twice
in history. The 2003-04 Pitt team, which
advanced to the Sweet 16, was 31-5.

Sam Young’s 32 points also brought him
into the history books, making him Pitt’s
all—time leading scorer in NCAA Tourna-
ment play with 130 points. He passed Carl
Krauser, who scored 125 Tournament
points from 2003-06.

Pitt coach Jamie Dixon, meanwhile,
passed ex-North Carolina coach Everett
Case for the most NCAA Division I wins
by a coach in his first six seasons. Dixon
now holds the record at 162.

View from the bench

Pitt walk—on guard Ryan Tiesi said he
had as good a View as anyone while watch-
ing Levance Fields’ last shots against
Oklahoma State. Even from the bench, he
said he could feel Fields’ last shot slicing
through the net.

“It was just awesome,” said Tiesi in the
locker room after the game. “Levance is a
gamer, we know that. I knew it was good
before it even left his hands.”

year with a loss to No. 12 Steve Bell of
Maryland.

“He came back [after that ﬁrst match]
and wrestled better,” said Stottlemyer.

Headlee dropped his first bout of the
Tournament, but also won his opening match
of the consolation bracket with 3-1 victory
over No. 9 Brandon Mason of Oklahoma
State. He then lost to Rider’s Jason Lapham
to eliminate him from the Tournament.

Headlee faced Lapham earlier in the
season, also resulting in a loss. \While it didn’t
work out, Stottlemyer’s strategy for the
season was to schedule matches against a lot
of top teams in the nation and compete in
tournaments with the country’s best.

It didn’t help the Panthers much during
the regular season, as they dropped all seven
matches against ranked opponents. Doing
this, Stottlemyer said repeatedly throughout
the season, allowed his team to see the top
wrestlers in the country in preparation for
the NCAAS.

“It didn’t help us like we thought it
would,” said Stottlemyer, adding he wasn’t
sure "how he would make up the team’s
schedule next season.

“We obviously wanted to have four
guys on the podium, but that’s the toughest
tournament of the year,” he said.

Even if he doesn’t create an incredibly
challenging out—of-conference schedule for
the Panthers next year, he thinks at least
Nauman, Conroy and Headlee should build
on their already impressive performances
this year.

“Those guys have had that experience,”
said Stottlemyer, “so they’ve got to go back
and work on what they’ve got to do better
and see if we can get back here next year.”
