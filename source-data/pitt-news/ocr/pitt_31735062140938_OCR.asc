were still front page news but most
of the space in the paper was given
over to a report on the lnternattion-

year and we all went out to cheer
our team after their defeat at Min-

mad rushing was on. Pittites were

tribute to Chancellor Bowman at

October 23——Classes were dismis-
sed for a pep rally the fourth hour
and Rosey Rosewell added his words
of cheer to the affair. We were in a
dancing mood at the time, for three
dances (rifles, soph hop, and mili-

licity. ‘

 A h At the close of every year it has been tradition for the retiring
 editor to publish a farewell editorial. One editor after another has
j Lvpdone this great feat with some success. Recently there came to me a

i copy of an edit printed in the Purple and White of Millsaps College,
7ackson, Mississippi. This edit covers all the points usually brought out

 by retiring editors so well, that I herewith publish it for all students
A _ andfaculty members. ’

V _ Profs can sit crosslegged on the top of a desk; dean’s ﬁrst
, list students can let down their guard; student body presi-
J (dents can fraternize with the masses.

Only aii editor is required to be pontiﬁcal always.

Only an editor is supposed to know everything that
happens, so it is taken for granted that he already knows it,
and nobody ever tells him anything; only an editor is
supposed to keep an open mind always, and at the same time
to make snap decisions for each political impasse; only an
‘editor is required to keep his nose out of politics, meanwhile
keeping tab on the strength of each separate lineup.

Profs have their apple-polishers who ask» questions after

class; dean's list students get their quarterly reports; student

a body presidents hear quarterly reports; student body presi-
i dents hear complaints in SEE meetings.

Only an editor has to guess.

Only an editor has to grope blindly along, trying to put
out a paper ‘for, a student body who will talk‘ only behind
his back, who will never tell him what they like or don’t
like, who will squawk audibly only when they are mortally -

: and irreparably wounded, who never thank him when he

 says anything nice about them or censor anything nasty,

 who have to be tracked down, cornered, and beaten insensi-
ble before they will so much as give him a news lead.

Profs have the satisfaction of seeing their teachings put
 . into practice; dean’s list students are an inspiration to their ,
 vsuccessors; student body presidents can point with pride at
year’s end to long rows of achievements.

Only an editor never accomplishes anything.

Only an editor has to endure the spectacle of 599 of his
600 loyal readers, each and every week, turning immediately
. on receipt of the paper to the Finger of Scorn, ignoring every-
th_i‘n’gf' else in the issue; to ﬁnd the layouts on which he and his
 have spent hours of work, completely unappreciated; to
zfeelfhis editorial campaigns which he has planned for months,
which are his only method of c'riticism of his school and of
‘society, coldly ignored. i

-l , Profs get to sit on the stage; dean’s list students don’t
;i,l1ave to attend class; student body presidents get to introduce
‘visitors.

. Only an editor is damn fool enough not to want to trade
C‘ " places with any of them.

. And, when all’s said and done, only an editor has the
satisfaction of knowing that his thousand words a week are
written down in letters that can never be erased; of feeling
somethingin a way which must have immediate and lasting
“effect; of knowing that, if he knew -how to use it, he has
the whole state for his audience; of sensing that he is doing
» a job for the students which no one else could do in quite
 the same way; and last but not least, of being sure of a staff
V that, no matter how much he is forced _to abuse them, over-
work them, deny them any reward for their work, will be
a driven back for more by pure love of literary effect. Only
7; an editor would gripe about it.

The AE Seniors lunged into top
place in the Engineering League

with six wins and no losses.
Enough games have not been
played in order to establish a
general trend of standings, but
-the IE’s show a very strong team
on the ﬁeld. They walloped the Met
Seniors by a score of 7-0. The
Metsretaliated by defeating the
Civils 3-1. By the way, the Civils
boast of the best dressed second
basema—n—Bob Graysay. You ought
‘to have seen him roll on the
ground with sport coat and pants.
Paul Aller, of the AE’s is consid-
ered the best dressed center field-
er. His combination is a light
green sport coat with grey pants
and white shoes. Wonder what's
next! ‘
_f~’ The League owes Forest But-
pterbaugh a new pair of pants. In
an attempt to get his hands out
of his pocket to catch a line drive
into left ﬁeld he ripped both
pocket seams to shreds. Wonder
how he explained the matter to
‘Mrs. Butterbaugh! _The long anti-
cipated game between the ME
Seniors and the AE Seniors was
terminated by an AR win of .5-3
last Monday.

For the benefit of some of the
Met Seniors--the League schedule
is arranged so as to extend into
the next semester. Every team in

_ the league will play all the other

seven teams three games apiece,
thus winding up the season with

Bureau Reports
Business Slump

Business in the Pittsburgh dis-
trict lost ground on a broad front
in April, according to the Bureau
of Business Research ofthe Uni-
versity. It is true of course‘ that
the decline was relatively small in
most’, lines and it is noteworthy
that the level of business in April
averaged far above normal. Never-
theless, even a moderate decrease
in‘ operations means a net loss
to the war program since a large
proportion of the major indus-
tries here are engaged directly or
indirectly in the production of war
materials.

Activities showing a slight de-
crease are steel mill output, and
bituminous coal production, be-
cause of the strike. With the ex-

scheduled to play the A1975 or any
other team this semester or not
does not matter, for the games will
be evened up during the summer
semester. After all we have only
one ball field and can play one
game at a time, thus one team
can't play every other team in

This Time W/lith Political Scientist Grape

By HERMAN FELDMAN
Plans for post-war world govern-

ments are,’ beginning to mushroom,
from every part of the world. To

shed a little light on the subject

Pitt News’ inquiring reporter has
interviewed »Dr. Elmer D. Graper,
professor and head of the depart-
ment of political science. Aside from
any plan with specific details Dr.
Graper believes that several funda-
mental. principles must character-
ize any successful plan.

“I feel that there ought to be a.
universal world organization with a
number of subordinate federations
to handle the problems of the many
different geographic regions. A
plan, in which the nations of each
region would combine to adminis-
trate that region and to send repre-
sentatives to a world organization,
has great advantages. It would not

face the diﬂiculties brought about‘

by having Chinese peasants, head-
hunters, automobile salesmen, etc.,

under one government. By combin-Q

ing groups of nations whos_efeder-
ations is based on similarities, this
obstacle would be overcome. Ely
Culbertson has proposed a plan with
some specific federations.”
'1?h hlb¢rts<?n '

the Reader’s Digest. Ely Culbert-
son, known for his skill in bridge
playinggproposes with. great de-
tail that certain definite nations
be combined into definite.federa-
tions. He says, for instance, that
Belgium, Holland, and France will
form one federation. His plan will
never be adopted in its present
form because the nations involved
will certainly want to work out
their ownminor details. ’
Dr. Graper stated that most of the
trouble of the world hascome from
Europe and that the greatest
amount of attention would be re-
quired by the European federations.
,“Proba.bly Russia, Britain, andthe
United States will dominate» the
post-war world for some time to
come. These three nations, because

of their size, will not join the Euro-

pean federation. They are out of
the spiritual boundaries of Europe.
It is very important that we remain
on good terms with both Russia and
Britain for these reasons.”

The fate of ‘Germany’, Italy, and
Japan in the world of the future
seems fairly certain. They will al-
most certainly remain _under for-

eign supervision for a_ long-time to.

At the last meeting of ESGC,
plans were made for the future.
It was generally conceded that as
a student government group, the
most that can be achieved is a gen-
eral coordination of all student
activities such as they may be. It
is impractible and improbable that
the group can govern and form
student, activities for the duration
of the war in the light of sur-
rounding weakening activities,
fewer male students, and a young-
er inexperienced student body.

It is planned ' to continue
ESGC"s present program of serv-
ing best, where it can. when it
can, and how i.t can.

Dickens Digest, compiled by

the reader whether he is a lover
of Dickens or just slightly acquaint-
ed with his writings. The works
have been put into one volume with-

A book whose author needs
no introduction, is “Seven Came

The role of the. author in
early aviation history is well

in this book. This is his version
of the first American epic in this

Retail Training

This month the Research Bureau for Research Training
marks its twenty-fifth anniversary, of the founding of one of
the professional. schools, the Research Bureau for Retail

Training.

This Bureaii was started by the retail merchants of Pitts-
burgh in 1918 at a time, not unlike the present, when they
were faced with serious problems due to a war. The armed
services and war industries had drained off most of the stores

personnel, and left them with
people.

a serious shortage of trained

These merchants from Pittsburgh’s leading department
stores agreed to underwrite the Retail Bureau for a five year
period. The Bureau was originally established as a part of
Carnegie Tech. In 1923 when the five year trial period was up,
the stores showed their approval of the experiment by renew-

ing their financial support for

By this time, however, the cur-
riculum of the Bureau had de-
veloped to such an extend that it
belonged in the graduate school of
a University. It was then a logical
step that the Retail Bureau be
moved to the other side of Forbes
Street to the campus of the Uni-
versity.

At first it was housed in a
small brick house near the pres-
ent site of the Cathedral. In 1932
it moved into the Cathedral and
at present it takes up the entire
19th ﬂoor.

Newest department for the Bu-
reau, which maintains ﬂexibility of
operation despite its twenty-ﬁve
years of successful operation, is
its accelerated wartime program
which went into effect on Febru-

classman in good standing may
now apply for entrance into the
Bureau, and may start in June,
September, or February.

why be different today?

But it 's a great life on pub-

something in the ice box that the

dragged across ﬂoors, and the
questions of inquiring “frosh.” rc-
porters; the ﬁghts with the Editor
(-his majesty) about how the front
page should be made, and what we
are going to use as our lead story,
but it always came out in the
wash; the yelling of “two beers
please” when Chirigos called up
one of his many girls; the chris-
tening of Rowbottom. as “paddle
top” (get it Rowbottom—paddle

bottle of champagne--no—we
drank it; the many muttered ex-

KAI-lFIoTATIo}?i§
‘ OF SPORT

By El./°\lNE KAHN, Sports Editor

    

, It has long been the custom for the last column of the
semester to concern itself with nostalgic references to the past
.plus all the farewells and thank—yous adhereing thereto. But
this year we intend to concern ourselves less with the past
and more with the future. And the future is Clark Daniel
Shaughnessy.

Mr. Shaughnessy has been with us for some three months
now and while the only footballs he has handled have been
for publicity purposes,‘ he has not been idle. For one thing

i Mi". Shaughnessy has been making friends. Indeed he has

been making them at such an alarming rate that, in compari-
san, Dale Carnegie must seem like a friendless misanthrope.

And then, too, Mr. Shaughnessy has been making plans--
_ plans for the coming football season. And they are plans that
are all-inclusive. When the Coach says “I want everyone to
come out for football” you get. the idea that he really means it.
For proof he proudly offers the fact that “we had 750 boys
come out for football during the course of the year at Mary-

~ land.” 
9

, The 1943 season promises to be an interesting one even
aside from the fascinating problem in mathematics that is

A ‘going to be involved when it comes to proving that eleven times

nothing equals a winning football team. The new coach is con-
vinced that there is much to be discovered in both the playing
and entertainment ends of football. Not that the “T” will be

.. abandoned. “I guess they’d run me out of town if I didn’t use
it" is Shaughnessy’s way of disposing of that.

Spirit and the will to win will count more with the Shaugh-
nessx teams than mere ‘native skills. “Only two, boyson our
first team at -Maryland had anything resembling tale‘nt,”— de-
clares the Coach, “but we came pretty close to winning all of
our games." ~

: The new coach is a ﬁrm believer in football as a means of
building and determining character. He ﬁnds the perfect argu-
ment for this in the deposed Governor Leche of Louisiana who
was thrown oﬁ the Shaughnessy-coached Tulane team some
twenty-ﬁve years before because he refused to play until he
knegw “what’s it going to get me.”

, The '43 team will be one drilled in deception, speed, and
the pure fundamentals. Shaughnessy is a football artist in a
literal as well as the ﬁgurative sense. When he outlines his
plays, he does them in color. Ordinarily this is pretty effective.
Sometimes it is not. There was the time he went to some
leiig'ths to explain a play to Norm Standlee, one of the most
outstanding of his Stanford players. He carefully charted the
play with vari-colored pencils, finally pausing to ask, “Is every-
thing clear?" “I’m sorry, sir,” came the apologetic answer,
.‘:‘but I’m color blind.”

We have never been too concerned over the size of Mr.
Shaughnessy’s pay check. The problem of whether he is get-
,_ting $20,000; whether he is worth $20,000; or whether any
coach is worth $20,000 has generally left us calm and unex-
cited. But it seems very evident by now that if Mr. Shaugh-
nessy is getting twice that amount and if ‘he never ﬁelds a
single team, he has‘ been more than worth it. Money could
not buy the good publicity, friendship, and good feeling that
Shaughnessy has brought with him.

Clark Shaughnessy came to Pitt tagged as “the greatest

coach in the country.” Today, if you wanted to change the Di-essler 85, Smith 85, and Dunn.

word “coach” to “guy” you wouldn’t have any trouble at all
in commanding a maJority opinion.
1i: >l= >3:

It doesn’t seem proper to close the sports year without

int-lulging in at least one fond memory and so we nominate the‘

second Pitt-Penn State basketball game as our own personal
highlight of the year. -

That was the “freeze” game and we shall ever remember
the looks of stunned perplexity on the faces of the State
rooters as Pitt staunchly refused to shoot for an entire half.
The game in itself was interesting. But even more so was the
publicity that followed. The critics (none of whom had seen
the game) took it upon themselves to accuse the Doctor of
everything from sabotaging the war effort to making a mock-
ery of the noble game of basketball and lowering the national

’ morale. All we thought he tried to do was win a game.

. Looking back, it was probably just as well for Dr. Carl-
son that -the Pitts lost. Considering the furor it caused, they
probably would have tarred and feathered him. and run him
out of the country on a 'rail had we won.

job two weeks ago. Hopkins, like Chester Smith and Eddie
Beachler of the Press, and Gil Remly and Jack Sell of the Post-

It took the Pitt golf team to save
the spring sports program from
complete 'ignomniy.VYes, the Golf
Team won a match. They beat Car-
negie Tech 6% to 2% in Wednes-
day's match. y

The Panther points were scored
as follows: In the first foursome
Captain Jim Butcher won his match
2 and 1 and Norbert Kroen won his

7 and 6. They won their best ball
3 and 2 to record three points for
the Pitt cause.

In the second foursome Dave
Thurbon lost one up. Al Dressler
and his Tech opponent were all
even on the eighteenth hole and so
shared a point between them. They
lost their best ball one up and so
the best Pitt got out of that was
half a point. - 0

Russ Smith won his match 7 and
5 in the third foursome. Jim Dunn
won 3 and’2. They also won their
best ball 3 and 2 to bring the Pitt
total to 6% points.

The individual scores were:
Butcher 81, Kroen 81, Thurbon 85,

90.

The Golf Team played against
Carnegie Tech at the Pittsburgh

is what the tennis schedule refers
to as an “away” game. The ‘home”
game with Tech will be played at

Just when it seemed that the law of averages would ﬁnally
obat for the winless Panther wonders, the elements step-
“ in and spoiled what thus far seems to have been the
inthers remaining chance to salvage something from a very
jmal season. V

W , Although only two innings of Tuesday’s Juniata.-Pitt
intest were completed at the time of the downpour, the Pan-
hers seemed in a fair way to be winning. Bill‘McKee started
hr the Pitts and, aside from a scratchy hit and a walk, sent

' _ ac Juniatans. down in 1-2-3 order. Pitt had a man on second

     
  
  

p th two. outs when the game was called.

 ‘There were some who wanted to. disagree with the deci-
on of the umpires to call the game after the ﬁrst downpour.
, jut‘ the critics were quickly silenced some minutes later when
‘ je real deluge came. Henry Kaiser could have used the Sta-
di-um to launch his victory ships after the second rainfall.

yffTo*say the Panthers were rained out is pure understatement.

They were inundated!
 Judging the records of. the two teams, the Panthers have
about as much chance of beating State tomorrow as the Phillies
‘; have of winning the National League Pennant. Both are pos-

Qisible but hardly probable.

“ } u,The Lions are reported to have a strong team although

’ they were beaten by Muhlenburg two weeks ago. Their game
with the champion Navy team was cancelled and so the obvi-
opscomparisons are out. One person to watch, however, will
be. aptain Whitey Thomas, the Lion shortstop, who is said
to be of professional calibre. ‘

It is likely that Bill McKee will again draw the starting
assignment for the Panthers with Joe Kielb again doing the
catching. _For State either Ray Wardrop or Johnny Stover
will do the hurling, with Oggie Martella behind the bat.

If the Pitts lose to Penn State they will record the ﬁrst
winless season since baseball was revived at Pitt ﬁve years
ago. In 1939, the first year of Pitt baseball, the team won three
games and lost ten. The following year they won two, and lost
ten‘. 1941 saw the best Panther team of all. That was the team

- i t had Edgar “Special Delivery” Jones and Bob Malloy,
-with the Cincinnati Reds, for pitchers and Guy Guadag-
0 who was with one of the Yankee farm clubs before his
uctioninto the army, for catcher. The inﬁield had Ernie
melli at third base, Johnny Brown at first, Eddie Straloski
second, and Johnny Vaiksnor at short.

‘ Pitt losses to date include a 7-1 Navy defeat, the 9-8 ten-
- hing loss to Juniata, a 7-6 drubbing from Bucknell, and a 9-2
ellacking from Army.

Last year an unsuccessful at-

because the engineers who had

for intramuraltilts afterwards and
because outside summer recrea-
