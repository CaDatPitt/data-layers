Acclaimed

An experimental course on elec-
tron microscopy originally planned
for a small number of advanced
students in the Department of
Anatomy has attracted scientists
and industrialists from all around
the country.

scope theory, planned by Dr.
Albert Lansing, head of the Ana-
tomy Department, is being taught
by Dr. A. C. Van Dorsten, a phy-

sicist who heads the Philips Re-
search Laboratories at Eindhoven,

” Holland.

Scientists from Carnegie Insti-
tute of Technology, Mellon Insti-
tute, Westinghouse Electric, Pitts-
burgh Plate Glass, the U. S. Bu-
reau of Mines, the University of

_West Virginia, the University of

Medical scientists now actu-
ally can see viruses, determine
their shapes, and locate their
exact position in the aﬁected
cells. Formerly, scientists mere-

Scholar Swap
With Hawaii U.

Announced 

The University has become
the ﬁrst of 25 American uni-
versities to sign an exchange-
of-scholars agreement W i t h
the U. S. 'g_overnment-spon-
sored East—West Center at the
University of Hawaii. -The pro-
gram will involve approximately
50 Paciﬁc and Asian counter-
part institutions.

The $350,000 program involves
the East-West Center’s Institute
of _AdVanced Projects and the
University’s Graduate School of
Public and International Affairs
(GSPIA). Asian and Paciﬁc schol-
ars will study in GSPIA’s Eco-
nomic and Social Development
Department. 1

Through the agreement which
goes into effect September 1 and
runs until August. 1, 1969, senior
faculty and doctoral students
here will go to the Center or
through the Center to institu-
tions in Asia and the Paciﬁc. At
least one international scholarly
conference on Asian and Paciﬁc
Affairs will be established.

Edward W. Weidner, Vice-
Chancellor of the Center and
head of the Institute of Advanced

McEvilla Wins Grant
For Prescription Study

The United States Public

Health Service has awarded a

three-year’ grant, totaling approximately $221,000, for a study
project to be headed by Dr. Joseph D. McEvilla, professor of

Pharmacy Administration.

Aided by a team of research
personnel, Dr. McEvilla will at-
tempt to develop a model pre-
scription recording system.

Dr. McEvilla said the project
will ‘involve extracting several
kinds of speciﬁc information from
prescriptions, on a large scale, and
in suitable form for storing the
data on magnetic tape for rapid
retrieval. An electronic computer
will provide a‘ printed‘ copy of
speciﬁc data which qualiﬁed re-
searchers will be able to use in
their studies.

An advisory committee also is
being formed for the study. Its
members will represent the medi-
cal and pharmaceutical profes-
sions, public health departments,
and the U. S. Public Health Ser-
vice. Facilities at the University,
at the Washington, D. C. ofﬁces of
the University, and of the Ameri-
can Pharmaceutical Association
will be used.

Lawrence County First

Dr. McEvilla said that the ini-
tial study will be made in Law-
rence County, Pennsylvania. Law-
rence County was selected because
it contains a mixed population as
to sources of income, numbers of
pharmacies and practicing physi-
cians, and other factors helpful to
such a research project.

Scheduled

last week, the University and

Carnegie Institute of Technology described a plan for a
formal sharing of students, faculty and facilities. A

Under the_new plan, graduate students at either school
will be permitted to take courses at the other school in
earth and space-related sciences. A

Forum Series
To Introduce
Mobilization

' “Today’s SUB Forum is the most
important program held on cam-
pus this year,” said Michael Mar-
cuse, chairman of the Forum Se-
ries. The forum “Awareness Isn’t
Enough,” will begin at 3 p.m. in
the supper room. .

Concerned with the education
of Hill district students, the Forum
Series is presenting a panel with
representatives from Harvard,
Vassar, Saint Lawrence, the Urban
League of Pittsburgh, the Pitts-
burgh Teaching Project, the Pitt
Volunteers, the Northern Student
Movement, and the Soho House at
Cambridge, Massachusetts.

The panel will dissect all the
possibilities of a student volun-
teer mobilization in the Hill dis-
trict. The panel will bring the
audience directly into the dis-
cussion. Participants will be
able to join the Pitt Volunteers
at the Forum itself.

The Pitt Volunteers are attempt-
ing to organize socially concerned
students to put in four hours a
week, usually in the evening, to
tutor high school students.

- The tutoring will begin on Mon-
day, J une.24, and will continue for
eight weeks. In the fall the Pitts--
burgh Volunteers headed by Tom
Mellers, aim to expand its hori--
zons with the recruitment of ad-
ditional University students.

In addition to exchanging stu-
dents and faculty, fellowships
held by the two schools will be
made available to students in
either school. Officials have an-
nounced that both schools will
apply cooperatively for National
Defense Education Act Fellow-
ships.

Limited to. Grad Students

At this time, the plan is limited
-to graduate students in one ﬁeld.
However, heads of both schools
hope the plan will be a pilot proj-
ect toward further cooperation-

University Chancellor Edward
H. Litchﬁeld and Tech Presi-
dent J. C. \’Varner stated that
“This program, and others we
hope will come in the future,
shows the determination on the
part of both institutions to pool
top personnel and facilities for
the development of the region
as a leading educational center."

The plan speciﬁcally involves
Tech’s Interdisciplinary Commit-
tee on Earth and Astronomical
Sciences and the

newly named Department of
Earth and Planetary Sciences
(formerly the geology depart-
ment).

Complementary Staff

“We will try to make sure that
we build up staffs that comple-
ment each other,” said Dr. -B.
Richard Teare Jr., dean of engi-
neering and science at Tech, “and
we will try to be sure each school
will have a good selection of
courses.”

According to Dr. David Hal-
liday, dean of natural’ sciences
at the University, there even-
tually may be joint research
projects also.

- l    Science llber Alles

Last week the University and Carnegie Institute of
Technology signed an agreement to pool their resources in
certain graduate departments for the purpose of advanc-

Iing research in the ﬁelds of science and technology.

This is most probably only a prelude to further agree-
ments between the two institutions on the undergraduate

level for the further advancement of the sciences.

This is both a ﬁne and a needed arrangement, for

’ where one institution is lacking the other is often strong,
, and the combination must necessarily be an improvement

over individual research.
However, science is not everything. Why couldn’t such

an arrangement be worked out for the departments ofithe

humanities or of the social sciences? Is English or history of
less importance to the ﬁeld‘ of learning than physics or
chemistry?

' If arrangements of this sort are to be agreed upon by the

: two institutions, then other departments should also be in-
cluded. Although a liberal education is the pronounced goal

of the University, when it comes down to combining re-
sources for improvement, the sciences receive all the gravy.

Froshi Uber /llles

Last week during the ﬁrst of the scheduled summer
orientation programs, the incoming freshmen‘ were bom-
barded with the best image the University has to offer.

»’ Theywere treated to a. dance in the Student Union’, a
romantic sail around the Golden Triangle, and a dimly lit
Hall. Besides these
evening hour festivities, the food in the cafeteria miracu-

’ llously took a turn for the better during their visit. And all

this was done to impress the incoming frosh, and they
naturally loved it. »

What no one seems to realize is that the students who,
are here this summer on a paying basis also enjoyed the
festivities, yet they will see no more of this type of enter-
tainment until the next orientation group detrains on
campus in a few weeks.

Everything is done to make the new freshmen feel that
the University is a place of fun and frolic as well as a place
to learn, yet no one cares about the students who are stuck
here during the long, dull days of the third term. Pittsburgh
during the summer is not the most exciting place in the
world to be, and we believe that it is the obligation of the
University to provide free entertainment for the paying
students similar to the type to which the orientation groups
are treated.

The Canvas-Backed Dollar, Or...

Once More, With Knuckles

 

Picture this scene — if you can. Four men in
a wrestling ring —— an announcer, the referee and
two wrestlers.

The announcer steps up to the microphone and
says in a deep, masculine voice,
“Ladies and gentlemen. The
next event, one fall, 20 minutes
time limit. In this corner,

ing 250 pounds, Bruno San-
Martino. In this corner, also
.we ari n g white trunks and
weighing‘ 250 pounds, Hans
Mortier.” _
The wrestlers come to the
center of-the ring to take in-‘
structions from the referee. _
They part, smiling, shake hands and . return to
their corners to await the bell. And there it is,
the start of the match. The wrestlers approach
each other cautiously, maneuver, lock together,
head to head. A quick movement and‘Mortier is
down, SanMartino maneuvering for the pin. But
Mortier executes a beautiful roll and escapes.
They lock again, and this time it’s Bruno who
ends up looking at the ceilng. But again, a quick
roll,‘a half somersault and Bruno is up.

And so it continues, a beautifully fought,
clean match for 19 minutes and 45 seconds, until
Bruno Sanlvlartino makes a fatal slip, and Mortier
moves in for the pin. Bruno gets up shaking his
head at his misfortune, but, smiling, goes over to
shake hands with Mortier and congratulate him
on his victory. Then he dons his robe and leaves
the arena to the sympathetic applause of the
audience. Meanwhile, Mprtier accepts his con-
quest humbly and acknowledges, the wild cheers
with bowed head.

Imagination" Is Funny ,

g If you now have that exciting and heartwarm-
ing scene ﬁrmly pictured in your mind, forget it.
It’ll never happen. It just isn’t the way to make
money in the wrestling business. _ ‘ '

To be a money-making wrestler, you’ve got to
have two things — a gimmick and a ﬂare for act-
ing. You certainly don’t have to be a very good
actor, but the gimmick is almost essential.

A Problem for VA"  . .

 

By Stan Stein

One of the funniest of all gimmicks, for ex-
ample, was that used by Ricky Starr. Starr, who
no longer wrestles professionally, was a ballet
dancer. Slender, lithe and graceful, he pirouetted
and arabesqued around the ring until his opponent
was too dizzy to put up much of a ﬁght. In a

opponents were usually Goliaths, but he tendered
such a David appearance that the fans, in merry,
uproar over his antics, adored him.

I

The Great Mortier’s claim to fame is, his
magniﬁcent physique. He’s probably the best built
wrestler in the ring today. He also has a well-
known and much—- disliked manager, Red Berry,
a vociferous, cane-wielding, little man who spouts
words as long as your arm, though he doesn't
seem ‘to know what most of them mean. Berry
is occasionally catapulted across the ring by some

has poked with his cane. , '

Even the Good Guy

Bruno Sanlvlartino, too, even though he
doesn’t seem to be anything but a good wrestler,
has an image. He is the big, strong, clean cut
“nice guy.” That's his image and he’s popular be-
cause of it. _

John Ringling.North once said, though not
quite inTthe same words, “'I‘here’s a Ring-side

Rosey born every minute,” and no ‘one learned the '

lesson better than wrestling promoters. They
cultivate ring-.riv‘alries, invent characters‘ and
create personalities with remarkable adroitness.
As a sport, wrestling never amounted to much,
though most wrestlers are in good physical condi-
tion because of the acrobatics involved. It never
will amount to much because it i§ fraudulent

Maybe it’s because there’s always ’a good'.guy and‘

a bad guy, which greatly simpliﬁes the problem of
who to cheer for and who to boo. _

The- biggest ring-rivalry today, of "course, is
that between SanMartino and Mortier. Frankly,
in a non-script ﬁght, I think Mortier would win.

pBut like I said, it’ll ‘never happen.

Racial Flare-Up,  

A Negro -student was walkingin the quad-
rangle toward the Student Union last Friday
evening when suddenly an unknown voice jeer-
ed a violently offensive racism. I

The Negro wheeled toward the dorms, picked
out a shirt glimmering in a
window, and headed for the
racist’s room. Finding the door
locked, the Negro student went
to the ﬂoor counselor and told
him what had happened.

Listening to»the Negro, the
c o u n s e l o r empathized with
him, but after a long‘ discus-
sion, he told the student that it "
would. be better if he, the
counselor, confronted the jeer-
ers. The Negro consented when
the counselor assuredhim that he would be told
what happened and that a report would be ﬁled
with the Dean of Men.

The counselor knew that five people had ac-
cess to the room named by the Negro, and when
he went to this room later all ﬁve were there.

' Stunned at ﬁrst, the ﬁve collectively appear-
ed ignorant but, individually, guilt was, as it
were, written on their faces. They were confront-
ed by ‘a white counselor who had an anger for
them no less than the hurt Negro’s. A few minutes
before, when one of them, who was an athlete,
had looked down at the back of the’ Negro and,
goaded on by the others’, so courageously ﬁred off
that word of hate, he had acted differently than
he would have if he had seen the Negro face to
face. '

One reason for the difference in behavioris
that this athlete wouldnot have had the courage
to chance physical combat with the powerful
Negro.

Another Reason

But there is another reason that is more signi-

ﬁcant, because the offender, as the counselor

 

 

_ {of each person to act
;,"«-y 45:.‘

By Thomas Plat-e

yards “away”: from the Negro, was notﬁring his
ill-considered hatred at one Negro, but rather at‘

some abstract’ Negro. This abstract Negro is the i

one created by his incomplete knowledge, by
what he knows about some Negroes (who live no

more animally than do some whites), and by his =

own frustrations.

Although a psychological analysis would‘ be »
‘pretentious here, the frustration that this athlete

possibly had been harboring has been called the
“second string syndrome.” Thissyndrome is a
way of behaving resulting from frustrations built
up by self—judged failures. 4

The syndrome is not unique to the athlete but
he illustrates it well. When the athlete does not

have the chance to gain recognition, when he ”
' must sit on the bench, then he must, because he

is like everyone else, feel frustrated.

Frustration Outlet ,

If he takes out his frustration by bouncing
around in elevators no one is hurt except those
late for classes. But if, consciously or not, he takes.
out his frustration on the abstract Negro, then he
is doing more than he realizes.

He is not only deeply hurting this particular
Negro in a way which is diﬁicult for the white
to understand, but he is smothering this Negro’s
desire to understand the white, which I imagine
is equally diﬁicult.

I have no cliche-ish aphorism with which to
sum up the lessons to be learned from this inci-
dent. There is no set formula that will resolve
racial tension in America or even in the Univer-
sity. Tension may always exist, but if the indivi-
dual himself resolves to annihilate this tension to
the point where only the idiot would insult a man
because he is black, then we will have come a
long, long way. A man whom I hold in consider-
able esteem said recently that not even the Presi-
dent of the United States can solve racial prob-
lems. No one man can do it. It requires-the effort

‘Rain’ and

Last Lecture

 

_ Soggy Acting

Mars Maugham
By VIJAY JAIN

“Rain,” as brought to the
sta_ge by the University The-
ater and the Pitt players, was
a disappointing and ineffec-
tive presentation of W. Som-
erset Maugham’s' short story
‘_‘Miss Thompson.”

Q Severaladditions were made to
bring the original text to; _a two
and a half hour presentation, but
John Colton and Clemence Ran-

dolph could not have done much
more to spoil the message and

beauty conceived by «Maughaml

h-ad they deliberately set out to
do so.

The production made’ a slow
start and added little in tempo by
its culmination,‘ three acts and

.two scenes later. The feeble at-

tempt to bring rain on the stage
was hardly worth the effort and
the special talent, Gulliver, the

dog imported for the play, seemed
to be injected into the play use-.

lessly. ‘

Hammed-up Sci-.i-pt .

Most of the performers‘ started

with a hammed-up script and

rendered their characters with

great gusto, which provided com-

pletely new characters from the
ones in the short story.

Sharon’Ec«k as -Sadie Thomp-
son ‘led the list of otfenders in
a gaudy costume. and heavy
makeup. She overacted «in the
role of a prostitute. ,

William Power (Corporal Hodg-

. son), Tom Kane (Private Griggs),

Mary Jeanne . Deegan _ (Mrs.
Davidson) and-‘Bob Sestili (Quar-
termaster Bates). all suffered from
the same malady of overproject-
ing their roles.

Misguided Missionary L
The misguided missionary, Rev.
Alfred Davidson, as played by
Howard» Slaughter, was an ade-
quate» performance of a difficult
role. Herb Petley (Sergeant
O'Hara), as love interest for the
woman of ill repute, turned in .a

wooden, stagey performance.

Don Wiechec as Dr. Macphail,
sympathetic towards Sadie, was
more of a philosopher, complete
with pipe, than a professional.

Strangely enough,’ the minor
characters Edwin Paulie (Joe

. Horn,) Esther Mandel (Ameena),

:‘\ 3»,

 

Ardith Jane Regdon (Mrs. Mac- .

phail), and Janice Cimberg
(Islander) performed superbly
and drew attention to themselves
amidst the faltering portrayals of
the more important characters.

One of the revisions made was
that the play ended on a hopeful
note; the viewers were merely
happy that the .conclusion had
come.

Responsibility
Needed Here

By TH‘OMAS PLATE

Bryce Nelson placed the im-
portance -of student action in both
local and international perspec-
tives at the ‘SUB “Last Lecture”

last Monday afternoon. Nelson,
assistant to the Dean of Liberal

Arts spoke to .a .—g8.thering of about

70, mostly students.

Nelson dealt with the University"
student in terms of the student’s

signiﬁcance within the world com-
munity. He said the leaders of
this country do not have a chance
to make this country a worthwhile
-place to live if students do not
ta-ke the individual responsibility
for the condition of our society.

The -responsibility of the stu-
dent is to the world, to the local
‘community, and to the ‘Univer-
sity’. “Where is the student or-
chestra?” he asked. “I would»
think a university of this size
-could support a student orches-
tra. What about the -‘theater?

.There is some theatrical work
done here, but I would think in
a university -of this size there
would be room for a greater
‘number of theatrical organiza-
tions, one -in which the students,
not '-the Speech Department fac-
ult-y members would -do most of

. the work.”

Nelson. turned to a lack of re-
sponsibility by students in the
classroom. “‘Too many students
seem to view education as a num-
ber of lecture series to attend. The
lecturer pores the knowledge into
the hole in the student’s head and,
the student, like Moby Dick ris-
ing to the surface after a long
submergence, sprews it out at the
end of the term.

"Too" often the student views
his total education in terms of
the super market, each course
representing three or four green
stamps, ‘called credits. When he
accumulates 124 -green ‘stamps,
he cashes them ‘in for a prize,
his degree. He regards his edu--
cation as ﬁnished when he ﬁlls
his stamp book.”

- Nelson said he disagreedwith
William Buckley, who, when he
spoke here in the fall, said the
student should be indoctrinated
into the goods of democracy. Nel-
son held that education is a dia-
logue, not a monologue.

Hams’ Radio Relay
To Hit -Three States

From an antenna suspended 200 feet above a sand’_ 0
barge at the junction of three states, the Amateur Radio

Association will begin broadcasting Friday at midnight as
part of the annual American Radio Relay League ‘:‘_Field.

_Usi-ng $150,000 worth of equipment and broadcasting

for‘ A

24 hours, the Ham Radio/Club will‘

be particiupating in a nation-wide
program for all ham operators to
practice for cases of. national
emergency or natural disaster. The
“University's part in the program

- and television.

In order to score a. high rat-
‘ing for their part ‘in the pro-
gram, the Ham Radio Club will
have to operate without a com-
mercial source of power. To
solve this problem, they have
borrowed a ten kilowatt gener- ‘
ator from Bell Telephone Com- '
pany of Pennsylvania.

The barge, which will float in
the Ohio River at the junction of
Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West
Virginia, has been borrowed from
the Dravo Corporation of Pitts-
burgh. -

Besides the antenna to be
suspended above the scow which
0 will be lit with neon lights
hanging from helium-ﬁlled bal-
loons, another of their antennas
will utilize the Ohio River. It
will be the world's largest sky-
wire since the Ohio eventually
connects with every body of wa-
ter in the world!

Further plans for Field Day will
be made at the Radio Club meet-
ing today at 6:30 p.m. in_ 326 S.U.

Exchange of Students Program
Formed With Hawaii University

Fellows who will spend up to
two years here studying the eco-
nomic and social development
p r o b l e m s of underdeveloped
countries. In Field Research one
to three students a year from
GSPIA will do ﬁeld research in
an Asian or Paciﬁc country.

Two or three senior faculty
members from GSPIA’s Economic
and Social Development Depart-
ment will be nominated for the
Center’s Scholars - in — Residence
Program. At least one jointly-
sponsored conference will be held
at the Center. The Center will
help the University develop a li-
brary of Paciﬁc and-Asian ma-
terials rela’.\g to economic and
social development.

The East-West Center was es-
tablished by the U.S. Congress in
October, 1960. Its principal ob-
jective is to contribute to mu-
tual understanding among the
peoples of Asia, the Paciﬁc area
and the United. States. Its. loca-
tion at the University of Hawaii
takes advantage of the island’s
unusual experience in inter—racial
living.

 

FORE VER !
This would notbe an exact answer to
_the _ question of “How - long does »a-

Volkswagen last?” Truly, we just
don’t know, but there are no worn
out ones around as yet. 6,000,000
Volkswagens are‘ now on ‘the road all
over the world. Demand still outstrips
supply. There must be a reason for
‘it. Why not ﬁnd out for yourself and
see how manyjextra built-in features
you get in a VW besides low gas
mileage, low initial cost, and high
resale value. See M. W. Motors, Pitts-
burgh’s Leading Factory Authorized
Volkswagen Dealer. Also good values
