Dr. Zagoria Analyzes
China, Russia Split

by DON MARBURY

“One of the main reasons for the Chinese-Rus-
sian split was a rapid growth of Chinese national-
ism,” said Dr. Donald Zagoria, professor at C0-
lumbia University. “The Chinese communists made
their own revolution without Soviet help, and even
against their warnings.”

Zagoria pointed out that there are so many dif-
ferences in Chinese-Soviet policiesthat there will
have to be a radical change in the policies of each
country for them to again reunite. “Russia will
have to become more militant, while China will

have to grow less aggressive.” He said that what‘

most nations don’t realize is that Mao is not like
the Soviet leaders, that he is a pro-phet of the
Marxian theory as well as a disciple.

Zagoria mentioned Vietnam in relationship to
Soviet, Chinese and United States involvement. He
described Vietnam as a pawn in a “global chess
game.” As for United States involvement in Viet-
nam, he says, “I don’t believe in the exercise of
power for power’s sake, but all problems cannot be
solved by withdrawal either.” He said also that
the Russians will probably continue to walk softly,
while stepping up military aid to Vietnam.

He pointed out that North Vietnam's own inter-
ests in the war are reunification and not letting
down their brothers the Chinese. Their only term
for negotiations is if -America stops its bombing,
while China tells them to hold out for complete
United States withdrawal.

As for the answer to the problem of Soviet,
Chinese, and United States relationships, Zagoria
feels that- Russia is right now too concerned with
their own internal problems to devote as much
concern to foreign matters as they would like. He
asserted that the Chinese will probably go on ac-
cusing the Russians of collaborating with the Amer-
icans on the Vietnam issue.

Faculty Discusses
Soviet Union Policy l

by DAVID BAER

Contrary to American propaganda, the Russians
actually do not have a master plan to spread Com-
munism throughout the world. This was the gen-
eral consensus of' opinion when four members of
the University faculty discussed the Soviet Union
Monday in the Student Union (SU) Supper Room.

Dr. Jonathan Harris, assistant professor of po-
litical science, started the discussion by noting that
the Soviet Union’s foreign policy is strictly oppor-
tunistic; that is, each situation is an individual
case. S

Dr. Carl Beck, a professor of political science
and director of the University’s International Stud-
ies Program, added that the Soviets believe in “ad
hoc-decision making.” To further exemplify his case
Dr. Beck noted the lack of consistency in Soviet
foreign policy in recent years.

While attempting to explain why he thought that
the_Russia.n foreign policy was this way, Dr. Allan
Pollack, an assistant professor of political science,
said that, the ‘Soviet Union is ready to do anything,
anywhere to extend Russian influence, up to the
brink of war. Dr. Pollack does‘ feel, however, that

“if a situation reached the brink of war, the Rus- ’

sians would pull back.”

Dr. Nikolai Poltoratzky, chairman of the Soviet
department noted that there is a difference between
Russian foreign policy, which relates only to the
zountry of Russia, and Soviet foreign policy which
relates to the entire Soviet block. To the Russian
foreign policy, Vietnam is relatively unimportant,
says Dr. Poltoratzky, To the overall Soviet for-
eign policy, however, Vietnam is in the interest of
expanding Soviet interests and is therefore impor-
tant. This is a rather subtle, but important dis-
tinction that is one of the causes of the Sino-Soviet
split.

Clark Probes Vietnam, Selecti

Pennsylvania Democratic Sen-
ator Joseph S. Clark will speak
Friday at noon in the SU Ball-
room. The speech, entitled “Viet-
nam and Selective Service,” is
under the sponsorship of the SU
Public Affairs Committee. A
question and answer session
will follow.

Senator Clark received his
law degree from the Universi-
ty of Pennsylvania, and, in 1951,
became Mayor of Philadelphia.
He was elected to the US Sen-
ate in 1956 and re-elected in
1962. He serves on sevenal com-
mittees including Foreign Re-
lations, Rules and Administra-
tion, and Labor and Public Wel-
fair.

The Senator is a Fellow of
the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences and a member of

the Pennsylvania State Planning
Board. He has written two
books: The Senate Establish-
ment and Congress: The Sap-
less Branch. _

Senator Clark has recently re-
turned from an information
gathering trip to Vietnam. After
returning to Washington, Clark
issued a report on his ﬁndings
and conclusions about Vietnam.
The report was is-sued last
Thursday.

The Olark report of Vietnam
concluded that the United States
has reached a stalemate in Viet-
nam.

The Senior Senator from Penn-
sylvania spoke at the Universi-
ty about a year ago. At that
time he was the guest of a high

NSA Chief Schwartz
Defines Student Power
At University Forum

by KATHY NAGY
“Students trying to develop control over their own learning en-
vironment and their extra-curricular environment is student power,”
said Ed Schwartz, -president of the National Student Association
(NSA). Schwartz spoke at a Free University Forum Monday evening.
“Students must learn to maximize options of student leaming,
i.§. question curricula relevance. Students must be challenged to

challenge. They must learn that they can challenge existing social ’

institutions,” he elaborated.

The basic tenet of student power is that people must be taught
that they can control areas in which they have immediate interests,

he said.

“Student power is not so much tactics as objectives. Student
power is trying to obtain power and legitimacy to pursue the options
you want to pursue, control your activities and your environment.”

Student power started with student activists in the Civil Rights
Movement. These students involved themselves in the movement and
found that the university was, at most, a reference point and in some
instances a hindrance. Later they questioned the relevance of the
university to social issues, Schwartz contended.

There is a paradox between
the real community and the uni-
versity community, he pointed
out. “And ultimately student
power has implications off-caim-
pus,” he said.

Schwartz stated that society
is set up so that people feel
that they cannot change any-
thing. High schools encourage
conformity and this pattern ex-
tends into the college atmos-
phere, he continued. The univer-
sity rewards accepting author-
ity and stands and lacks com-
munity. “The pattern is worth-
while to break down,” he said.
“And the method of breaking
down varies from campus to
campus.”

“The universities now create
a set of analytical tools that are
of almost no help -in ﬁghting
real problems. They don’t help
you ﬁnd your identity,” he said.
“The univensitiies should enable
people to develop a sense of
having power over themselves
and other things,” he said.

The student can begin getting
involved by taking pa-rt in small
issues like dorm regulations, he
stated. “The next stop is regu-
lation of curricula,” Schwartz
said, “and this is the beginning
of political action.

Panel Analyzes
Military Might

(Continued from page 1)

The panel also discussed what
it termed “parity versru-s per-
pond~e;rance.” Dr. Poltoratzky
said that the Soviet Union is
doing everything in it:s capacity
to develop its military might to
the ext-ent of the United States.

To this Dr. Beck replied that
it is also true that the United
States, in turn, continues to in-
crease its destruction capacity
in order to stay ahead in the
arms race. Dr. Harris noted that
while both governments want to
avoid a direct confrontation, the
restraint and pressure on those
who must restrict the capabil-

. ities for destruction grow with

each successive build up.

In -summing up, Dr. Pollack
said, “We are playing 'a very
dangerous game,” and someday,
somebody may just make a 
take.

McGra.nahan stresses that the
credit unions, alhough set up by
volunteers from outside the com-

members of the commimity. He
also states that the setting up
of the credit unions will pro-

Editorial: A Plea For Progress

The tragic death of former Chancellor Edward H. Litchfield
caused us to continue our recollections of the aspirations of our Uni-
"versity and student body four years ago. We recalled a statement_issued
during his ‘tenure of office: “The University is at the halfway mark.
.- Much has been accomplished. Much remains to be done. The prospects
for achievement are bright.”We tried to recapture the optimism of our
freshman year, an optimism we no longer experience. But we cannot
live on past words and deeds. We are wrong to look i‘n retrospect; we
must now moveforward.

Our editorials these past few weeks have reflected the hopes we
members of thestudent body felt four years ago, the promises for new
dormitories, a new Student Center, better parking facilities, and the
maintenance of a cosmopolitan atmosphere. We’ve discussed the now
defunct Pitt Progressive Party’s plank calling for a students’ book
center in its platform four years ago that is still not a reality. We
looked back and saw the encouraging signs of a University on the move,
a feeling we cannot experience any more. But this reflecting cannot
make our University what we felt it could have been; it is merely the
dreams of those of us who remember the Litchfield era. We will be
graduated in a month, though, as the students who came after Dr.
Litchfield’s exit assume our positions of leadership. '

We must now turn to the future and what this future holds for
this University. We must accept that we are a state-related school with

all its advantages and disadvantages. We must accept that we are on
our way to becoming the commuter school We were years ago, as there
are no definite plans for the desperately needed dormitories. We must
accept that out-of-state students do not turn to our University as they
did a few years ago. We must accept the above limitations, because we
are students and cannot change the direction of a University. We have
to accept what we are given, but We urge Chancellor Posvar, our faculty,
and administration not to accept our current course.

Sometimes it takes years for students to realize they cannot change
the course of the world, much less the course of a university. But those
at the helm are responsible for our direction, and they can contend with
the crises facing our University. They can seek more successful meas-
ures to improve our out-of-state ratio. They can make sure that there
are dormitories to house these students from out-of-state. They can
provide for a new Student U;nion. They are the ones who can save us
from stagnation; we are merely victims of their decision.

Dr. Posvar has been chancellor for less than a year, and We could
never presume to judge the course he will take in his new role. All we
can do is implore him to remember the students’ interests and our goals.
We ask him to stand with us in refusing to accept that the University’s’
fate is to go dowmhill. We are a University that made phenomenal

strides in a relatively‘ short period of time. We can do it again. We ask I

Dr. Posvar to give us once more the key to greatness.

  The Search For Identity

by Sheryll Zippany

NO MATTER WHAT we
tell ourselves, no matter how
beautifully we try to phrase
our excuses, all of us are
searching for an identity.
The mechanisms and motiva-

. tions may very individually,

but after cutting through
the thick walls of rationaliz-
«ations, the basic core of ex-
istence is exposed.

I believe everyone probes
life for meaning. All of us
are faced with failures, suc-
cesses, competitions, and
just plain struggles of ‘all
types of names and descrip-
tions. Yet we keep plodding
on, hoping we will ultimate-
ly do the “right thing.”

There are two general clas-
siﬁcations of persons involv-
ed in the search for identity.

..,~ One type is often afraid to

let their voices be heard
above the rest to take _a ﬁrm
stand o-n any issue. Their
convictions may be ﬁrm, but

  News

 

are known only to them-
selves. These are passive
seekers and are relatively
saf‘e from public opinion, be-
cause the public rarely rec-
ognizes that they are seek-
ing anything. Granted that

some inhibitions are neces»

sary, but the passive seeker
lives in a world of his own,
unable to verify his search
to others.

THE OTHER CLASS, the
active seekers, are the ones
who get attention because of
their dynamic identity
search and because of their
constant questioning of ideas
and beliefs, not only of those
they encounter but also of
their own. These are the peo-
ple who oppose status quo
when it no longe-r applies,
who are willing and deter-
mined enough to formulate
new and better solutions to
old problems. These are the

what they believe to be right.

When John Ruskay and
Loren ‘Hershey captured the
podium at the Tap Day cere-
monies a few weeks ago,
they wanted “to give Uni-
versity students a chance to
speak out.” Maybe they were
actively seeking a chance for

expression——a plea for time.

to stop and evaluate just
what individual identity
means in today’s world. I
don’t think the Tap D-ay
ceremonies were the place
for such a discussion, but
such relevant problems nee-d
to be brought out into the
open, talked out, and elim-
inated.

Student leaders all over
the country are ﬁnding it ne-
cessary to examine their
positions on political issues
as well as moral ones. The
identity search is being con-
tinually expanded on cam-
pus after campus, encom-
passing more and more prob-
lems and involving more and
more students.

THIS LEADS to the ques-

tion of group identity. Ev- .

ery individual in a group
faces the conﬂict of his iden-
tity. Group identity on a
comparatively small scale be-
comes national identity on a
large scale. Our current na-
tional identity is largely mir-
rored in the searches of the
youth, who feel it is neces-
sary to establish a society
that will contribute to the
welfare of all.

There is a massive move-
ment involved in the search
for identity; Signs of it are
evident everywhere you
choose to look. This is es-
pecially true of University
life. Students are ﬁnding the
opportunities to challenge
ideas, people, and themselves.
How many of us who actual-
ly ﬁnd the answers to our
questions cannot be esti-
mated.

The question of identity
could be the most important
one we ever try to solve.
When you come right down
to it, unless we can achieve
individual identity, we can
achieve little else.

  

GSPIA Student

Lauds ‘News’

Editor, The Pitt News:

One often hears that Pitt lacks
school spirit. Allow me to dis-
agree. I must confess that dur-
ing my stay at Pitt its friendly
and dynamic spirit has been
rather contazgious. I believe that,
to a large extent, The Pitt News
is responsible for developing
that school spirit. Of course, one
only has to make 'a rruinvor ef-
fort t-o ﬁnd it, but it is there.

As I am about to return to
my country, Ecuador, I would
like to congnatulate The Pitt
News for the ﬁne jo-b perform-
ed throughout these years and
to wish it conntinued success.

I would also like to take this
opportunity to bid farewell to
my friends and classmates and
to wish them good luck in their
studies. Their fniendship and co-
operation shall be kept as cher-
ished memories. And since it
would give me great pleaisxutre
seeing them again, I wouldn't
like to say good by, but merely.
Hasta pronto amigos?

Editor, The Pitt’ News:

As a Greek co-ncerned with
maintaivnring the integrity of the
Greek system on this campus,
I ﬁnd it necessary to write this

in which the recent election for
Greek Week Queen was con-
ducted. My attack is in no way

against the ﬁnalists themlselveus,
but rather against the proce-
dure involved.

I feel that some way rn*u's~t be
instituted to make this competi-
tion more fair and unprejudiced
than it obviously Was. No for-
mal announcement was made in
The Pitt News or any other
place concerning «the daite,«time,
and place of the voting; the vot-
ing was in only one location
which also happens to be an
area highly frequented ‘by only
fraternities and sororities (as
the results show); the voting’
booth was run for most of the
‘day predvominanutly by the same
groups; and of the eight ﬁnal-
ists, six of them belong to the
same sorority, including a ﬁnal-
ist Who happens to be the chair-
man o-f the Greek Week Queen
competition. (I see this not only
as a “conflict of in*te-reset,” ‘but
also as being unfair to many of
the other candidates because of
her controil over many of the
above facts.)

I realize that this letter will
be read and soon forgotten, and
that next year the same thing
will probably happen. Any call
for a re-vote. will, no doubt, be
put down. One answer may be
to vote at meetings. At any
rate, I ask {Pan Hellenic Coun-
cil, Inter-fraternity Council, and
each Greek organization on this
campus to act «so that in the fu-
ture precautions can be taken
to insure unbiased and fair vot-
ing so that all Greeks be given
an equal chance. We must make
sure that Greek Week is a time
for all Greeks to be represented
in all ways.

Taube Criticizes Novel

by DIANE BLOCH
“The Red and the Black is a novel about a young man who be-
lieves that the pattern of Napoleon could be his pattern. It is a man’s
attempt to reach whatever level he can reach with all the class

structure against him.”

These observations were made by Dr. Myron Taube, associate
professor of English at the University, during his talk on The Red and
the Black by Henri Stendahl, “Can every man be his own Napoleon?”
Thursday night at the YM & WHA. This is the first of a series, “Love,
Life and Death: Three Small Themes in Six Great Novels,” which is
held by the Isaac Seder Educational Center Program.

“This is the novel of man's
development,-” said Dr. Taube.
“You’re seeing a man who is
nothing but who believes him-
self better than the other guy.
Ea-ch man has built a wall
around himself to keep others
out. Julian (the main character)
must break through -these so-
cial barriers.

“Julian assumes a. hypocriti-
cal role because he isn't a be-
liever. He does it to get places.
He is nothing. He, having no
place in society, must assume a
role. He realizes you must be
able to present many faces to
the world.

“Julian is very aware of a
need for a uniform. He is al-
ways aware of his external. Ju-
lian sees two possible Ways of
making his way in society. One
possibility is to go into the
Church and wear the black out-
ergarment of the clergy. The
other way is to don the red uni-
form of the army.

 

“Ailthongh Julian turns to the
clergy as his means of attain-
ing social 1""."Slt‘lOl'l, he uses mili-
tary tactics. As he rises in the
world, he realizes he will make
conquests,” said Dr. '1‘-aube. “Ju-
lian equates his ﬁrst sexual con-
tact with ﬁghting a duel. The
day after, he feels a sense of
achievement. Sex takes on a so-'
cial function. It is a way of get-
ting back at peo-ple..As he moves
up in the World, he still thinks
of love as a means to military
conquest. His ambition destroys
his ability to love or be ]ioved.'.’

Dr. Taube explained that Ju-
lian is motivated by his duty to.
himself. “He is too concerned
with himself to notice anything
else. He attempts to make so-
cial conquests and move up in
society just as Napoleon, a. Cor-
sican, did. Just as Napoleon in
exile, wherever Julian (is, he is
in exile. There is a. conﬂict in
the reality that is really there
and the reality in his mind.

by JAY ROSENSTEIN

Charles “Buzz” Ridl, head
basketball coach at West-
minster College for the last 12
years, last night was appointed
head basketball coach at Pitt.

Considered the outstanding
college coach in the tri-state
area, Ridl accepted the position
by long-distance telephone from
Kansas City where his team is
currently competing in the NAIA
small-college championships.

In his tenure as Westminster
coa=ch, Ridl’s teams have won
214 and. lost 89., for a .706 per-
centage, which is the highest of
any collegiate coach in the area.
He has taken six of his clubs
to the NAIA tournament and
his teams have won the West
Penn Conference title ﬁor seven
of the last nine years.

The 47-year-old Ridl was voted
the NAIA Coach of the Year

 

in 19629 when Westminster was
voted the number one small col-
lege in the country by both AP
and UPI. His 1960 and 1932
teams reached the ﬁnals of the
NAIA tournament.

His present club is enjoying
a 20-6 year, including two con-
vincing wins over Pitt. Ridl has
done the job at Westminster
without one full grant-in-aid
balllpolayer on his roster. Earlier
this year, the Titans lost a close
game to Duquesne at the Civic
Arena and it’s Worth mention-
ing that the Dukes have 26 play-
ers in full scholarship. ‘

In announcing the decision,
Athletic Director Frank Carver
said} “Buzz’s selection speaks
for itself because of his reputa-
tion as a man, his experience,
and his record. This Was a unani-
mous decision by the basketball
screening committee and it was

STRAIGHT

TALK

by Jay Rosenstein

Sports Editor

THE LIGHT IN THE TUNNEL
The year 1963 was a glorious one for University sports.

In the fall, football was splashed across the front page week

after week as the Panthers (9-1) ranked number three in

the country. In the winter, the basketball team _earned a

berth in the National Invitational Tournament and wrest-
lingilpasted of_ Eastern champions. ’

When the class of 1968 entered Pitt the following Sep-
tember, it had no reason to- expect anything less. However,
the unsuspecting freshmen were soon to be disillusioned.

Actually “shocked” would be more truthful. The class

of 1968 suffered through the Worst four years in Univer-

sity sports history as Pitt managed to win eight of 40 foot-
ball games and 25 of 92 basketball contests.

The university’s athletic policy became confused, op-
erating under four Chancellors. Chancellor Litchﬁeld had
raised academic, standards, putting the recruiting program
into a traumatic state. For some reason, it took the Athle-
tic Department four years and ﬁve new coaches to discov-
er that it could successfully recruit scholar-athletes for all

sports.

Athletic Director Frank Carver blames himself for not
applying the brakes on the decline sooner. However, the
worst that can be said about Carver is that he is an eternal

approved by the entire Athletic
Board.”
When contacted in Kansas

City, Ridl expressed conﬁdence
that with outstanding local high
school basketball players, “to-
gether we can make Pitt basket-
ball an oustanding success.”

“My ﬁarst -objective,” he con-
-tinued, “will be to recruit some
of this area’s talent to the Uni-
versity. The University offers a
great opportunity for local bas-
ketball talent to compete against
the best college teams in the
nation.”

Ridl made it clear that he did-
n’t believe it necessary to go too
far away to recruit the ‘ballplay-
ers who can make Pitt :a winner,
and he emphasized, “I don’t

like to lose, no matter where
I’m coaching.”

Ridl knows that he must re-
cruit successfully if he's going
to win. He admitted that he left
a secure position at Westmins-
ter to come to Pitt. As he put it,
“I want to tackle collegiate bas-
ketball on a bigger level, and
that’s bascially why I chose to
come.” V

Ridl had gone as far as he
could at Westminster and that
remains to be seen if he can
effectively use the ﬁve grants-
in-aid the University alllots for
rblasketball. ’ Recruiting for the
Titans was a different kind of
job, although it should be noted
that Ridl landed Mike Dresp-
ling,» a senior on this current

team, who was a ﬁrst st-rling
All-Stater four years ago.

There is no «question of his
coaching ability. His teams work
beautiful offensive patterns and
never seem to take a had shot.
If he gets the horses, he can
win. But around here, that’s a
big if.

However, as he said last night,
lhe’s accepting the challenge to
rebuild .P-itt basketball. He ad-
mires the University, having
gotten his Masters degree here,
and he feels there's plenty of

«basketball interest to go around.

“If there’s something there to
see, fans will come,” he predict-
ed. “If there nothing to see, I
won’t blame them -if they stay

away.”

Baseball Team Prepares for

Tougl1CaliforniaTour

by JERRY L. GRUEBEL
If the Temptations depended on men like baseball coach
Bob Lewis to buy their records, their latest re-lease, “I Wish
It Would Rain” would be a flop instead of a hit. The words

don’t -coincide with his wishes.

The baseball team has been practicing for well over a month
now, but due to rain, snow, and typically cold Pittsburgh weather, the

Panthers couldn’t play outside
until last week.

But this past week has brought
optimlilslm into Lewis’ outlook.

“The weater this past week
has been unbelievable for Pitts-
burgh at this time of the year,”
said Lewis smiling. “We’ve play-
ed a couple of seven inning
games and on Sunday we even
got in a full nine innings.”

Lewis is hoping that the good
weather stays here for at least
the remainder of the week. Con-
finement in the Trees Hall gym
and Eielzd House battinlg cage
has no-t given the outﬁeldens
ample opportunity to -practlice.
And the overall hitting has suf-
fered.

“’Dhe pitchers are way ahead
of the hitters in practice,” ex-
plained Lewis. “They weren’t
hitting well over the week-en-d.”

Lewis doesn’t seem to think
that exceptional pitching causv

tice.”

The bad weather has also had
a toll on the ﬁeld. The ground
is still very soggy and there
are numerous lumps scattered
on the ﬁeld.

“The boys hit a lot of pop
ﬂies and ground balls in the
weekend games,” said Lewis,
“but they haven't been able to
get good footing because of the
condition of the ground. You
have to have good footing to
hit the ball solidly.”

Whatever the “exlcuse” ——bad
weather, a soggy playing «field,
not enough practice, etc. —— tlhe
Panther blaseballers are going
to ‘have to take advantage of
these‘ last few practice sessions
this week. You can't win if you
don’-t score.
