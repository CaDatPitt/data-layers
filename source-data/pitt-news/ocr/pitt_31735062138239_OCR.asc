~ THE MclNT‘/RES‘ _ _ .
Lewis Wédse1“l\-Iclntyre, ‘B. ‘S’. ‘in C.
‘ E..’12.  ‘U  ,‘
We ‘know him. as professor now, but
the members of the 19127 class? knew
him as a “darn good ‘fel1ow”J-and a-
prime mixer in all student ‘activities.
During --his Freshman year he played
football’, -basketball and baseball on
his class teams, and during his A ‘senior
year he. was president of his class.
.Like all Mclntyres his aﬂiliation is
with the Phi ‘Delta Theta fraternity,
in which he has been actively inter-
ested in recent years-as an alumnus
advisor and as secretary of the alumni
of the‘ I:ota chapter.  L *
Professor Mclntyre was a ‘member
of Alumni Council during .1916‘ and
1917, and on account of his work in
that capacity he -has been chosen to
represent the School. of Engineering
on the 1912 committee for the Alumni
Building Campaign. He is a member;
of the Society for the Promotion of
Engineering Education and ‘ and asso-
ciate member of The American. So-
ciety for Engineers. L . i
Professor ._Mc‘Intyr_e is an active
Mason andis a member of the Shrine
here in Pittsburgh. During the war
he served -asa lieutenant in coast ar-
tillery, and the information he gained
in -this capa_city‘has been made avail-
able, -without stint, to those in charge
of thenew. Pitt R. O. T. C. ‘ . 
Previous to becoming a memberof
the University faculty Professor Mc-‘L
Intyre was a sales engineer with the“
Keystone Lubricating Company and
an assistant -engineer with the Depart-
ment of Public Works‘ of the City of
Pittsburgh. In the latter capacity he
was actively engaged in‘ city improve-
ment work at the time of the “cutting
of the hump” and similar important
civic improvements. . _
Engineering students of the present
generation have had ample. opportun-
ity to learn to know Professor Mc-
Intyre outside of the, class rooms, as
-he has, during recent years, been “ a
m.ember' of th‘,e“:';staff, of the engineering
.-lcampf; at‘: A Ca‘-mp~ «>W‘indb.er’, _ .

L This is “T.ubby" McIntyre -of the‘
University football squads of 1916, .’17
and. ’18.j As a hammer th'rower_ on the
University track team ‘Tubby has won
many points for the University and
has long been one of’;Andy‘ Kerr-’s
mainstays. , ,
Tubby is a Phi Delta Theta.
The aviation corps claimed his serv-
iceslduring the war and as no plane
was staunch enoughto carry his beef
and brawn aloft, Tubby had -to be
content with serving as a ground man
and making it _po'ss'ible§.'wr those * other
Iightweights to fly r‘wi‘th_Lcom-parative

He‘is -a graduate of Central High
‘School "where he was prominent in
athletic activities as “ a -‘protege of
Andy Kerr's‘ even in those prehistoric
days. Tubby is popular with Pittites
for‘ his ‘jovial’ good humor and his
contention that a man weighing some-
thing less -lh-anaton can do one hun-
dred yards in ten ﬂat.‘

Elizabeth Hazel Mclntyre, Econ. »’21._jt.
Elizabeth is a graduate of Central
High School and has chosen the
School of Economics _as a preparation
for a business career-——she refuses to
be rutted by “the thing g’irls‘ar'e ex-
pected to.” . , ..
Elizabeth is vouched for by the
Economics faculty as an A-1 business

TEACHING -SUB.-TLE my

 ASSEMBLY SPEAKER  
r M 0EElARES  

Teaching wascharacterized as “the
most subtle and absorbing of ‘all arts
known to man” by Dr. Ellwood Hend-
srick, speaker at the M-last general
student assembly in MMemorial Hall.
‘Choosing “Teaching and Business” as
his topic, Dr. -- Hendrick dwelt at
‘length onthe intimate‘ correlation of
the two, emphasizing the ‘point’ that
no instructor can ‘lay claim to any
nM1easureVof success who has failed to
clearly "M impart his own, standpoint A to
2. the student, or convince him of the
usefulness of the, subject studied.
“In teachinggno less than in business,
is persuasion the salient, underlying
feature?’ ,was one of the sentiments
Qexpressedy by Dr. Hendrick. _ His

or severa1‘?I,hium*orous incidents in his
school fPca'i{eei', which f;Dr. Hendrick: as-“
