gtulclents Picket" John Birch Meeting

 

By MATT pswmonic

arade in Protest

 Of ‘Un-Democratic’ Birch Society

More than 200 University students joined in a protest demonstration ‘Wednesday

night against the meeting of the John Birch Society in the Carnegie Institute Lecture-

Hall.

The protest, which was sponsored by the temporary Student Committee Against

Totalitarianism, was viewed by an oﬁicial of the committee as a rejection of the “John

Birch Society as the un-democratic institution that it is.” 9

Robert Welch, founder of the‘
conservative Society, was the
main speaker at the close—door
meeting which began at 8:30 pm.

Maintaned Order

No one was denied admission to
the meeting by the marching
demonstrators but occasional
shouts of “There’s a better movie
playing down town!” and “One,
two, three, democracy for me"
were heard to come from the stu-
dents. ‘ p

Marching past two abreast,
the protestors maintained an
orderly but efficient demonstra-
tion.

As the students paraded by in
an endless circle past the en-
trance to the Lecture Hall they
flashed their signs at the people
climbing the stairs to the meet-
ing. T

‘Quit the Society”

The signs, all home made, call-
ed upon the “John Birchers” to
“Go Home,"«“Quit the Birch So-
ciety,” and to stop trying to make
“democracy .un~American.”

Others said: “Will the Big
Lie work here?", “Hitler isn’t
dead, he just changed his name
to Welch.” and “Supreme Court,

Sii—Welch, Nyet!”

The most popular sign likened
a picture ‘of Hitler to the name
Welch. ‘

The picket line remained uni-
broken except for a few occasions
when the demonstrators grouped
together to have their pictures
talien by the news agencies corn-
ering the protest.

Twenty - one undergraduates,
six graduate students and two
faculty _members will appear in
University T.heatre—Pitt Players’
upcoming production of “Julius
Caesar," John Ulrich, director of
University Theatre, announced
today.

“The University—wide character
of the cast,” Dr. Ulrich said, “is
an implementation of the new
Theatre policy on campus. Pur-
pose of the policy is to encourage
participation in production by all
segments of the University popu-
lation.”

Gilbert Lazier, a veteran Pitt
Player. is cast as Anthony. Herb
Margolis and Tony Lufrano, two
other active Pitt Players, will ap-
pear as Pindarus and Ligarius re-
spectively.

Larry Heller, who played Tess-
man in last winter’s Theatre II
performance of “Hedda Gabbler,”
will play Ciasca and Titinius. Har-
vey Miller. an education graduate,
will portray Julius Caesar. Miller

Campus Seryi«c«c
Set Tomorrow

Dr, Stanley Barlow, director of
the Westminister Fellowship, will
address tomorrow’s Campus Serv-
ice ot Worship at 12:10 pm. in
Heinz Chapel. The subject of his
address will be “The Gospel We
Miss.” / “"

The Heinz Chapel Choir will
sing ”Wonderous Love,” a south-
ern foll~:—hymn.

“The prospect for many
materialized,” Heath explained.
“We reached our high water mark.
two years ago with seven Wood-.
row Wilson fellows. We had one

last year. We hope to have one
this year."

Dr. Heath is chairman of the
Rhodes and Fulbright Commit-
tees at the University and na-
tional representative for the
Woodrow Wilson Fellowship, as
well as director of the University
Counseling Service.

The evaluators are faculty
members who evaluate students
exhibiting mental acuity of a
creative nature who are nominat—
ed by two faculty members. Then
the student becomes a “ward” of
Dr.‘ Heath and his staff and re«
ceives all possible aid and guid-
ance in fulfilling his educational
aspirations.

The ‘letter states that many of
the freshmen in last years pro-
gram have transferred from the
University, while others have
found the higher caliber institu-
tions of their choice ﬁlled. Heath
said that this was especially true
of those in the Liberal Arts.

He urged the evaluators to
make suggestions on the problem
and to help in the identiﬁcation,
evaluation, and guidance of the
students.

Evaluation sessions“ are sched-
uled this year for the fall and
winter trimesters only. Each fac~
ulty advisor was asked by Dr.
Heath to serve the committee on
two occasions in one trimester

only.

In a letter to the evaluators of the special student fel-

of the reasons for the lack of fellowships at the University
is that “the trimester program has not proved to be an at~

gin their careers at one of the best times in the
history of the company. For plentiful oppor-
tunities await them in both engineering and
management.

As we enter a new era of communications,
Western Electric engineers are carrying for-
ward assignments that affect the whole art of
telephony from electronic devices to high-speed
sound transmission. And, in the management
category alone, several thousand supervisory
jobs will be available to W.E. people within
the next 10 years. Many of these new man-
agers will come from the class of ’62. _

Now’s the time for you to start thinking
seriously about the general work area that
interests you at Western Electric, the manufac-
turing and supply unit of the Bell Telephone
System. Then when our representative comes
to your campus, you’ll be prepared to discuss
career directions that will help make the inter-
view proﬁtable.

After a man joins ‘Western Electric, he will

”"*‘Hypnotism, White Magic’ Found
In Theatre ll’s ‘The Hairy Ape’

. ‘J,

t\7'

   

By JUDY MEISLIK

Sometimes it takes pure
hypnotism to make a play
like “Hairy Ape” by.Eugene
O’Nei1l get across to the audi-
ence. The play is outdated, as
social protest plays often are,

and ﬁlled with dramatic incidents 3

which make the Viewer snicker

in spite of himself.

There was hypnotism and
white magic in the Theatre II’s
production. It was supplied by
Rudolph Ricci, who played Yank,
the ‘fhairy ape,”

Ricci dominated and magnetiz-
ed the audience until they sub-
mitted to the idea that he is great
and that he, as the “hairy ape,”
is being beaten down by a mate-
rialistic and cold society. This
happens because, and in spite of,
the fact that he is brute force and
animal vitality.

Acted Forcefully

It took forceful acting to allow
this character to push and claw
his way to the top and then
plummet to his death. Ricci gave
a powerful performance.

He never overacted nor
derplayed, he was there
panding his character into one
which is believable and yet re-
tains all of its symbolism.

p O O O

The “hairy ape” is ﬁghting all
of society that has never felt
strength and life. This portion of

society is represented by the lily-

white socialite, who in an attempt
to see what the other half is like,

George Mazzel played his role
like a marionette going through

stead of characterizing the age of
men who long for the days when
men were free from machines, he
sounded like a machine who play-
ed on endlessly. 

James Chapman as Long
faded into the background as
did all the rest of the charac-
ters. Although he was meant to
be the socialist agitator present-
ing a hope for reform, he didn’t
agitate anyone.

As long as Ricci was on stage 

the play was all it was written to
be. He carried the play to limits
of dramatic intensity and made
it a success.

For a school that is striving for academic excellence,’
the University still lacks enough students who will even-

tually evolve ‘into scholars.

The Special Fellowship Program. presents the strongest-
picture. of this deﬁciency. Designed to screen prospective
Fellowship applicants and to guide the mentally acute stu-
dent, the program ‘currently has very little material with
‘which to work. Of the 5000 undergraduates on campus
_only 73 are now enrolled in the program, including fresh-

men, sophomores, juniors and seniors.

While the problem is far reaching in it.s implications,
chairman of fellowship committee, Dr. Roy Heath, has

for the scarcity. From what Dr. Heath has said, *the tri-
“mester program is not attracting enough good students, and
those who do come are seldom satisfied with the results. In
many ‘cases, students have become discouraged and have
attempted to “transfer up” to what they consider a more
"satisfying aeademic fulﬁllment. I

In the light of these facts, the more immediate prob-

lem is in holding on to the few good students who have

“ﬁltered through as well as in improving standards for ad-

mission and increasing the academic appeal oflthe trimester.

. One’ major improvement would be the reductionof class
sizes.

    
  
 
  
  
  
  
   
    
  
   
 
 
   
  
  
 
 
  
 
  
   
   
 

Granted, the present system has its advantages. By
‘setting up a lecture class of 80 to 150 students, more stu-
dents are able to take advantage of the knowledge and in-
- struction of a good Ph.D. P ’ I ‘

But in the recitation period when the student-teacher
communication is so important, the student is subjected to
I the graduate assistant. There is little opportunity for the
student to get to’ know his academic superior and to ex-

. ' ’ tive level.

t In the same manner, the large class is detrimental not
- only to the studentbut tothe teacher ‘as well. A great part

fecting it into the right channels. Therefore, no student
can beadmitted into the program_ unless he has been rec-
ommended by ‘atleast two faculty members. How can the.
Ph.D. give a" '.valid evaluation when he has had no oppor-
tunity to know the students, except one or two in ‘a hasty
_ conference in his ofﬁce.

So while in the long run, the trimester may be at fault
for the scarcity of student scholars, the present need is to
encourage the potentiality ‘now on campus so that in the
next two or three years the existing 73 students will be
able to grow academically. And one way this can be done
is by going back to smaller seminar classes wherever pos-
sibl in the undengr duate. chool. I’ ‘-

Birch In The Lurch

By NATHAN. FIRESTONE

Robert Welch, a retired candy
manufacturer and leader‘ of ‘ the
controversial‘ John Birch So-
ciety, spoke to the Pittsburgh
chapter last Wednesday evening

at Carnegie In-
stitute Lecture
Hall. ‘
The meeting
began with the
Pledge of Alle
glance and an,
invocation by at
Roman Catholic
priest. Then
Welch started,
to speak, nerv-
ously shuffling *
his notes throughout his ninety
minute speech, ' ~r
, He lectured in a dry monotone
with a slight trace of.a New
England accent. And seeming
“gun-shy” after the controversy
caused by his allegation that
Dwight D. Eisenhower was a
“conscious agent of the Commu-
nist party,” Welch merely in-
ferred that people like Full-
bright, Eleanor‘Roosevelt, Walter
Reuther» and Milton Eisenhower
are “comsymps” (communists or
sympathizers).

The speech itself was Very
difficult to follow because of the
speaker’s long sentences and
questionable logic.

Welch began by saying “the
greatest thing to be concerned
about is the gradual loss of the
sovereignty to the forces of in-
ternational Communism.” He
added, “the Federal government
is controlled by Communist in-
fluences.” ,

Prostitued Art

Continuing his theories, Welch
said: “all art is prostituted to
the service of the communist
conspiracy.” He gave, no concrete
examples of this, but they are
listed in The Blue Book of the
John Birch Society. There, one
ﬁnds listed Arnold Toynbee, Jus-
tice Holmes and Carl Sandburg.

Next Welch warned about our

 

“flight to amorality.” He implied,

that there were people who had
every justification in their be-
lief that “there are certain bio-
logical demons in our.body” that
induce this ﬂight to amorality.
, At this, several old ladies nodded
‘their heads as if saying “Here

Nobody Else Will Do.:.

 

is a man who finally understands
what the trouble is.”
' Welch then launched into the
body of his address as he pa--
tiently‘told the audience that he
wanted to give them “an fnsight
into the strategy of Commu-
nism.” »
Hist. explanation was rather
confusing. Welch explained that

Communist strategy was based,

on the “Principle of Reversal.”
This is his own interpretation of
the Marxian dialetic. Welch
said “the heart of the policy is
to take two steps backwards
and one step forward.” He was
apparently confused by this, so
he ‘further clariﬁed it by saying
“Take two little steps backwards
and one giant step forward.” I
believe that what Welch was try-
ing to say is “give small conces-
sions to get big! gains.”
Three Examples

He explained this by showing
three examples of the “Principle
of Reversal” through the use of
“catch phrases.”

The first was that in 1940, the
most important thing for Com-
munism was to get the United
Statesinto World War II. The
easiest way to do this, obviously,
was to elect Roosevelt. But there
was a distrust of the “great de-
magogue,” according to Welch,
so the Communists invented a
catch -phrase: “I don’t like FDR,
but we need him..for our foreign
policy.” It worked. After FDR
was elected he provoked the
Japanese into attacking us at
Pearl Harbor.-

He “clarifies” this further in
The Blue Book. Welch writes:
“For the real facts not only con-
stituted plain and unadulterated
treason on the part of both
Marshall and himself (Roose-
velt). . . .” ‘

For his other examples, the
speaker showed how the “Com-
munists” hindered Taft and Mc-
Carthy by coining clever phrases
equal to those that the Birchers
used during Rooseve1t’s election.

Welchian Examples

Other Welchian examples of
“The Policy of Reversal” include
foreign aid, the Soviet military
threat, thelie that the .masses
are attractedto Communism, re-
ligion and the Polish and Hun-
garian revolts.

Welch stated that “foreignlaid

 
  

   
 
  

  
  
       
     

is really designed to give aid f
the Communists under the guise
of fighting them.” He concludes:
this by saying “the threatiof our‘
side war is completely pho.
designed to speed us on t
path of Socialism and Com
nism. He explained that the S
viet Union couldn’t even conqu
Finland in 1940. Welch says th

we are so strong that the‘S
viet Union wouldn’t dare attai
us.

Then Welch went on to _§ 
that it is‘ the hierarchy of th
social structure.that is attra I
ed to,Communism, not the loweg
classes. He illuminated thi
statement by a brazen and obv-
ious attack on the President arid;
his advisors: “There are more,
Communists in Harvard accents"
than in overalls.” .

No Evidence . ;

Then Welch, without one piece;
of evidence,,said that 7,000 of,
the 20,000 Protestant clergyman‘
in this country are Communists;
He explained this by saying that p
it is not the ministers who be- gl
come Communists, but Commu-3'
nists who are trained to be
clergymen. \

Finally, he advised that the
Polish and Hungarian revolu-
tions of 1956 were perpetrated
by the Communists to lure the
underground from hiding.

Welch concluded by proclaim-
ing “Our government has been
_the most important single force
causing the advance of Comma-
nism while pretending to be
against it.”

Illogical I Attack

A standing ovation applauded
this illogical attack on our ﬁnest
people and institutions.

Welch is a sincere but pathe-
tic individual. He believes what
he says, but is too colorless to be
a demagogue: His attraction is
even more difficult’ to under-
stand because of this.

One could use Welch’s “Re-
versal” theory to prove"the John
Birch Society itself is :1 Com-
munist front seekingto make us
forget the Soviet military men-
ace. \

This hypothesis is used to
show ‘how, ridiculous Welch's
logic is. But then, the John
Birch Society itself completely
misunderstands the nature of
Communist danger.

The Choice Is

By JIM NELSON

Last week I picked up the Connecticut Daily
Campus from the pile of exchange papers The Pitt
News receives from colleges and Universities all
over‘ the country. The headlines at the top of the
newspaper boldly stated: “Students United; Fight
for Rights.” Centered in the
middle of page one‘, which had
‘no other news stories,. was 5'
paragraph of explanation:

“This issue of the Daily
Campus is being published to,
dramatically illustrate the _sex.'i-
‘ousness of the problems con-
fronting the student body at this '
University.

V 1. Students have been denied
the right to allocate their own
funds. (The Student ‘Activities
Fee) ,0 ,

2. The Associated Student Government has not
been recognized as the representative body for the
students at the University of Connecticut.” There
was not a word of print on any of the following
seven pages.

Our Problems

_ What does this have to do with us? Nothing, as
far ‘as the problems facing the student body of
Connecticut University. But what problems are
facing the student body here at the University of
Pittsburgh? There is a clamor from the dorm stu-
dents that the University Health Service is in-
competent and of littleguse. is this true? ,Have
you had any experiencetwith your h alth ‘ i_

g

 

     
 

   

Have you tried to prove or disprove these charges?

Student Government and Interfratcrnity Coun-
cil are discussing the possibility of permitting the
use of alcohol on campus. What is your opinion
of allowing alcohol? Have you bothered to ask
anyone else’s opinion on the subject‘? It is a
touchy and timely discussion. I

What approach are you, as a part of the stu-
dent body and faculty of this University, taking on
current subjects concerning you? I have seen no
approach at all. -

The Chancellor often asks what students think
about this or that current subject of interest to
UniV9FSity students. He usually gets a blank
“Owing. Students apparently are ,not thinking
about current events. _No wonder many of the
administrators have stopped asking what students
believe‘. Yet, students continually protest that the
administration never listens to anything they have
to say. ‘

Final‘ Decision

It is true that the ﬁnal decisions about Such
Current “—‘V¢hts lies in. the hands of the trustees of
the U“iV91"SilY, but they will have plenty of time
to think about them when and if the matters ever
reach them. You as students and faculty should
be_ thinking about these questions now. These
things must not be left to a select few people to
d1S?“SS_ and take action. You must have an alert
newsmmdedness to know what problems these
leadem are facing and help them remove obstacles
to mak‘? necessary -changes. .

“It Goes On...

PROFILE: JOHN MICHELOSEN
The University of Pittsburgh is not the kind of institution a
‘career football coach would naturally gravitate to. In short, Pitt
is the kind of school chronically in the grip of athletic schizophrenia.
It is in Western Pennsylvania where winning is an obsession, but

I!

 

chronology and geography which prevent it from being a member
of the Ivy League.

Such was not always the case. In the 1930's the Pitt Panthers
were the Beasts of the East, won the national championship, and
jvanquished Washington 27-0 in the 1937 Rose Bowl. Jock’ Sutherland
was the coach then, and Pitt success is synonomous with his name.

During that period a boy didn’t have to be on the dean’s list to
be considered a complete gridder. Then in 1938 when the “Dream
Backﬁeld” was a reality, Upton Sinclair wrote in a magazine: “Pitt
is the only university in America that gives a high school diploma.”

De-emphasis came in, Jock went out. He, merely crossed Forbes

Steelers. De-emphasis and emphasis played leap frog in the suc-
ceeding years, and no one knows what to call the predicament that
Michelosen is in. The quarterback of some of Jock’s most successful
Pitt teams, his successor at the helm of the Steelers, and now a Pitt
coach, it is inevitable that Michelosen is constantly compared to his
old teacher. t
A lot of Michelosen’s mannerisms are identical and his pow-
erplay offense is likened to the old-time method, but John says
there are some sharp differences:__ “I don’t know that I rate to
be compared rwith Doctor Sutherland,” he exclaimed. “In my
mind he’s possibly the best coach that I‘have ever known.‘
“He was a man that commanded respect just by being in his

disciplinarian that he was. I’ve seen boys make mistakes and never
play ball for him again. Still, any comparison I would relish as a
-compliment.” S
"How You Played '|'|1e Game"—Ugh!

At the moment, few compliments are wending Mike’s way. His
ghostly form is presently swaying in the breezes in front of the
Student Union. He has been hung in efﬁgy after three straight losses.
The fans are kindling their ﬁery_ insults to a higher degree, and it
appears that football buffs don’t agree with Grantland Rice’s classic
lines: “not that you won or lost —- but how you played the Game.”

“I don’t care what they say about me. I’ve been burned
before,” Michelosen disclosed during. an hour-long interview.
“But it upsets me when they knock the kids. The kids are young
a.nd it's still a game to them. Too often when they’re slam-
banged around when they’re still young they get bitter.”

“I guess it bothers my family to hear harsh criticism about
me. My wife, Fran, told me once that Marty (now a freshman at
Pitt) used to ggt upset about it. A few weeks ago my youngest son,
Jock, eight, was in the stands during the Baylor game. While he
was bounding about the stands, he heard a fellow yell, ‘Michelosen,
you stink!’ Jock was somewhat stunned by the exclamation, and he
retaliated in defense of his dad. ‘So do you, Mister,’ Jock yelled back.
"Public ls Fickle"

“That’s the general public for you,” Michelosen continued. “It’s
very easy to second—guess after the thing is-done. No one does it
more than myself. The public is very ﬁckle —- they want to see
winners." .

Michelosen has no ‘qualms about the local press, however. “I
get along pretty well with the press. I respect their writing abilities,
and it's important that we work together." .

One newspaper in this area,that doesn’t see eye to eye with
Michelosen, is the “Courier,” Pittsburgh’s Negro daily. Occa-
sionally they cast a scornful glance at the All-Caucasian line-up
that Michelosen has recruited and cry “segregation.”

referring to the owner of the Washington Redskin’s pro outﬁt, which
has the palest huddle and the darkest outlook in the National Foot-
ball League.

“I have called upon the Courier for help several times in re-
cruiting Negro ballplayers,” Michelosen remarked. “We have went
after about a half a dozen boys that we thought would be qualiﬁed
.in the last couple of years.” _ '

“I still consider myself a good friend of Henry Ford, Bobby
Grier and Chester Rice,” he mentioned, speaking of some Negro
ballplayers who graced the line-ups which he inherited when he
first came to Pitt. “We tried to get Curtis Vick of Braddock just
this past year. But I’m not going to recruit a Negro boy just to
prove a point." , V V

“We recruit within a radius of 7,500 miles, and we have
found most of the stars can’t qualify academically. Out of the
WPIAL’s all-star team, only two of the eleven were eligible.”

Chancellor Litchﬁeld is the one who has imposed these rigorous
admittance requirements ‘at Pitt, yet he remains one of the most
ardent Panther supporters. When asked if Chancellor Litchﬁeld has
pressured him any to open up his offensive play, Michelosen replied,
“He has expressed that he likes to watch interesting football.”

Last season Michelosen was elevated to a professor’s tenure, and
his job was like an appointment on the Supreme Court bench. “That

doesn’t relieve any pressures to myself. I still want to win."

T00 LITTLE, ‘too late is the cry ofathe ardent fans in the Stadium
as Fred Cox, Panther halfback, is forced out of bounds on the West
Virginia 38, after racing ‘22 yards with a pass. from Jim Traﬁcant.
Glenn Holton made the stop, and Jim Moss is pulling up short.

Navy Wins, ,20 - 39; it   I
Waslo Second Again

. The individuals

By GERRY MAZO
of Pitt’s- cross—country squad dropped

another decision this past Saturday, as the Navy team easily
outdistanced the Panther harriers, 20-39.

.Dropping their third dual meet of another dismal sea-
son, the charges of Coach Carl Rees now have an overall
ledger of two victories and four defeats. The two wins came

at a quadrangular meet in Ohio,¢

when the Cat runners placed
ahead of both Bowling Green and
host Kent State,
but lost — top
honors to Ohio
University

Despite hav-
ing .the home-
course advant-
age for th e
initial time this
year, the‘ Pan-
ther thin—clads
again allowed STEVE WASLO
their opponents to dominate the
rush across the ﬁnish line. Be-
having like perfect hosts, the
Reesmen ‘politely said, “After
you” to the men of Annapolis.
C Waslo Finishes’ Second

Joel Heine led the Middies to
victory and took individual laurels
as he just nipped Pitt’s Steve
Waslo in an exciting ﬁnish.

Kaliden Smiles At
Black’s Booting

With many problems still to be
ironed out before they take on
the West Virginia freshmen, Cub
grid Coach Bill Kaliden can thank
halfback Bill Black for solving
any difficulties that could have
arisen in the kicking department.

Black, who came to Pitt from
Washington H i g h, consistently
sent his kickoffs inside the five
yard line and punted for close to
a 40 yard average against Kent
State.

The assistants have taken over
the coaching chores of the Fresh
this week as Kaliden helped prep
the Varsity for the West Vir-
ginia game..Ka1iden scouted the
Mounties in two of their games.
Most of the Fresh work has been
on fundamentals and learning
some new. plays.

   

 

Heine’s time of 22:48 was one of
the best times ever on the Schen-
ley, Park course and particularly
good when one takes into con-
sideration the wet and chilly
weather.

The encounter was virtually
decided, however, when Navy
claimed third through ﬁfth
places. After Pitt’s Larry Ro-
binson came in sixth, the Mid-
dies clinched the event when
their last scorer placed seventh.

“The first four Panther‘ runners

are all sophomores,” explained
Rees, “and I guess they’re going
to learn through» experience. They
have good potential, but except
for Waslo they haven’t shown it
so far.”

“Physically they were ready,"

continued the Pitt mentor, “but I

guess Navy was more hungry.” -

“Garbage” .

Quote Fires

,Up Mounties

By JIM O'BRIEN

This department supposed-
ly gave A the West Virginia
Mountaineers a‘ better “pep-
talk” than even the late, great
Knute Rockne of Notre Dame
could have done. The visitors
were given food for thought when

they read The Pitt News which

contained a quote by Panther End
John Kuprok, which read: “Sure
they’re rebuilding, but ‘just like I
said last year, they’re rebuilding
with garbage.” ‘

‘ The Mounties were incensed by
this remark, and went on to tear
up Kukrok and all his Panther

"counterparts. The quote received

wide-spread publicity, and made
for a good romantic tale, but a
quote from Roger Holdinsky, the
West Virginia halfback who scor-
ed two touchdowns, was probably
more revealing-

After the 20-6 victory, Holdin-
sky, a skinny, blonde towhead, re-
marked, “Our blocking wasn’t
particularly good; it was just that
their tackling was awful ba (1.
They (Pitt) were down. They
weren’t ready. They just walked

to and from the huddle."

Colvard Couldn’t Smile

One of the heroes of the win,
Fred (Colt 45) Colvard was the
only Southerner who wasn’t smil-
ing, in the victor’s dressing room.
A Panther gent, aptly known as
“the hatchet,” nearly scalped the
plucky quarterback in the waning

the surroundings.

His left eye had a triple-patch
above it, his blonde hair was
stained with blood, and he was
in a stupor. “What's the score?
Who won?” he muttered to those
nursing his wounds. He buried
his head in his hands and wept
hard.

Everyone else was shouting
about the “garbage” remark, and
delighting in their upset win. Jim
Procopio, a sub halfback, stood on
a bench and shouted, “We’re
pretty darn good for garbage
pickers. Well we picked them.”

Mountie Boasts

Glenn (The Horse) Holton
didn’t think that it was an upset.
“No upset,”.he drawled. We had
’em all the way! We’re just in
better team, tha’s all!” A

A teammate nearby cautioned
Holton about boasting so. He
said. “You shouldn’t say things
like that, Glenn. That Michelo-
sen fella might pick up one of
0"!‘ 5011001 Papers and see that,
and we’d be done next year.”

“Your right,” Holton conceded.
“We’ll justhave to tell the ex-
change editor back home to
scratch Pittsburgh off the mailing

list.”

 

moments of the contest, and Col-,
_ vard was completely oblivious of

 

POOR. JOHN Michelosen was hanging,

at half mast yesterday as
some students hung the coach in eﬂigy. At right is the notorious
garbage can with a PITT NEWS copy appropriately tossed in it.

A SocceriBubble Bursts:

Mich. St. - 4, Pitt - 1

The Pitt soccer team ﬁnallysuccumbed. After two weeks
as the University’s only winning squad, they bowed to
mighty Michigan State, 4-1, at Kennard Field Saturday.

Despite the fact that the Panthers carried the ﬁght to
the opponent in the ﬁrst half, two second-quarter goals sent
the Spartans ahead into a lead that was never threatened.

, Losing Coach Leo Bemis called the Visitors “vastly im-
proved over 1.ast year’s Michigan State team, which I thought
was even better than St. Louis.” Senior Captain Steve Dan-
iels agreed. “They’re the best
team. I’ve ever played against.”

Sprinter Scores '

The sloppy ﬁeld slowed the
Spartans’ forward speed. Mabricio
Ventura, iwho scored two goals
Saturday, is a bona fide 9.6 man in
the hundred, for example.

Add to this three of the best
fullbacks in the nation and a
goalie that represented the West
Indies in last year’s Pan-Amer
ican Games, and one realizes
that Michigan State is a team to
be reckoned with in NCAA com-
petition.

But the local lads weren’t over-
rated by the Spartan phalanx.
“See you in the playoffs,” jeered
one deﬁant Panther. .

Corky Cuthbert, although his

iStaab’s Knife-Like Shots

   

Monday, October 18, 1961 — THE PITT -NEWS -- Page 7‘

  

Goalie Plugs Defensive Hole

By ED HOWARD

At Kennard Field, where the
University of Pittsburgh’s soccer
team does its practicing, one has
no trouble distinguishing Tom
Staab. , _

Tom is the tall, rangy lad
crouched -in front of the net, a
ﬂaming red armpad shielding his
right elbow. The nineteen—y_ear—
old sophomore from Beaver Falls,
Pa. is -a goalie with a bright fu-
ture. I C

After a high school athletic ca-
reer spotted with injuries and
only moderate success, Staab is
beginning to come into his own
as an athlete. Before coming to
Pitt, he had tried his hand at

Squash To Soccer
Pitt squash coach Bill Sum-
mers,, who doubles as assistant
soccer coach, spotted Staab in a
physical education class last win-

‘out
team.
“Tom picked it up quickly,”
says‘ Summers, “and became the
number four man on the fresh-
man team _right away. Then
(head soccer coach) Leo Bemis
. and I began to realize his po-
tential as a soccer goalie.”
Bemis talked the crew—cut lad
into coming out for the soccer

for the freshman squash

team this fall, but St-aab’s chances
for advancement seemed limited

at‘ ‘best. George. Georgakokis, a
veteran net—minder, seemed en-
trenched. The Beaver Falls boy
gave George a run for the posi-
tion, but the coaches decided that
experience was a needed factor,
and Georgakokis was chosen to
start the ﬁrst game, against
Frostburg State Teachers College.

The day before the game, how-
ever, Dame Fate intervened.
Georgakokis got in the way of a
hard practice shot, suffered a
pulled ‘tendon and severe bruise
around the left shoulder. Staab
was put into the starting eleven.

“I was‘ really nervous,” sad-
mits Staab. “It was the s first
college soccer game I'd ever
seen, and I was in the starting
lineup.”

Once the ‘contest started, out-

ward signs of Tom’s nervousness _-

vanished. Before the game “ended
in a 1-1 deadlock, the young
goalie allowed just one shot in
fourteen to slip by him, and
Frostbui-g’s goal wasn’t his fault.

“He had no chance to block that
shot,” says Summers. His own
man blocked his line of vision and
he couldn’t see the ball coming.”

WHY ONLY 11 MEN ON A FOOTBALL TEAM? Because all the other students
are just too busy. Yes, busy doing research, studying, smoking Luckies,
playing bongos, smoking Luckies, dating, partying, praising professors
and smoking Luckies--much too busy for football. Why so many “smoking
Luckies”? Simply this: We try to give an honest representation of college life;
