The GSPIA/Economics library

of digital resources.

the University Library Systems,
said. “Libraries have seen dramatic
changes.” '

or closure, Miller said.

Administration considered
closing GSPIA’s library in the past,
but couldn’t ﬁnd room in Hillman
for GSPIA’s books at those times,
he said. The University Library
System has since shipped some
books to storage, allowing GSPIA
to take the vacancy.

Miller worked closely with

Academic Planning and Resources

Jonathan Livingston: .  
The top 15 - the top 20 -
programs in the country

Miller said the decision to close ~

the library was a combination of
the needto free up space in Posvar‘
Hall and reduce cost, but didn’t say
how much money the Graduate

School of Public and International '

Affairs would save or how Posvar
would utilize the extra space.
This library closing is part of

Federal government extends $2,500 tax credit

Michael Macagnone
News Editor

The federal government will continue to
help families ease the sting of tuition cost
—- at least for another two years.

The American Opportunity Tax Credit, a
$2,500 tax credit for most working families,
will extend until 2012 as a result of a deal
reached between President Barack Obama
and Republican leaders on the Bush era tax
cuts, according to the White House blog.

None of the tenets of the program will
change, according to White House spokes-
man Shin Inouye.

' the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, said the

tax credit will continue unchanged for stu-
dents already in college, and new families
will be able to apply next year. .

Neither Inouye nor the White House blog
mentioned whether the extension of the cuts
was part of the White House’s larger plans
to reform higher education.

Although students who had heard about
the program —— and many hadn’t —— ap-
plauded it, some thought it wasn’t neces-
sarily enough.

“It seems like a good idea,” said Emily
Cohen, a junior Studio Arts and Psychology
major. “But I don’t know if giving tax credits
is the best way to go about that. There are

She also said that she wasn’t sure that the
parents of students who pay their own way
through college should get the tax credit.

. John Coyle, a sophomore Nursing major,
said that the government should take into
account previous children as well.

Coyle is the fourth child, and though the
previous three have gone through college,
he’s now his parents’ only dependent.

“I seem like an only child to them,” he
said.

Coyle didn’t have a suggestion to improve
the tax credit, or higher education in gen-
eral, though.

“I really don’t know what I would recom-
mend,” he said.

The tax credit came about as part of the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
of 2009. It was originally meant to last until
the end of 2010. The Obama administration
has been pushing for an extension for the
last few months.

Maag said that the tax credit goes in full
to individuals making up to $80,000 in ad-
justed income a year, or up to $160,000 for
a married couple.

She said that the tax credit is not a factor
in ﬁnancial aid decisions, and each quali-
fying student in a family will receive the
credit. I ' ’

ommons Room closes for private event

No notice or explanation came from the University before closure

Olivia Garber
Assistant News Editor

University officials were rela-
tively close—mouthed about the
event that closed the Cathedral
of Learning Commons Room yes-
terday afternoon.

Right before 3 p.m., around
zoostudents were ushered out
of the popular study space.

Music for the Holidays, an
annual private University event,
was the reason for the closure,
according to Sharon Malazich,
an employee at the University’s
Office of Special Events.

Malazich did not give any fur-
ther information.

With most of the Commons
Room banned, students were
forced to retreat to surround-
ing alcoves — areas not quite as
conducive to studying. .

Morgan Masci sat hunched
over a wooden chair in one of the
alcoves, poring over a stack of
papers before her night class. A
second chair facing her direction
served as a makeshift table.

 

“It’s not really bothering me,”

she said, referring to the unusual
study position. Masci, who usual-
ly studies at the Cathedral before
and after her night class, said the
closing of the Commons Room
wasn’t a big deal.
’ Lynn Hoelzle andjill Leadbet-
ter were similarly unperturbed.
Although the two freshman
rarely head over to the Cathe—
dral — both are enrolled in Pitt’s
School of Dental Hygiene —— they
were two of the few_lucky enough
to nab a table in one of the al-
coves. _

Both said they didn’t mind
that they couldn’t use the Com-
mons Room.

Jennifer Semans didn’t mind
either, although she was a little
upset over the sudden expul-
sion. '

,“I wish they would have giv-
en some advanced notice,” she
said.

Semans, who normally studies
in the.Commons Room three to
five times a week, also sat at one
of the few tables in the alcoves.
“I got lucky,” she said. I

declined..Detection devices at the library’s
entrance monitored about 35,000 people

entering and leaving in 2006. That number
whittled down to about 20,000 last year.

Administrators were also concerned that
reference transactions, the number of times
students meet with librarians, dropped by
half in recent years. Miller said that GSPIA’s
librarians and their salaries would be better
utilized in other sectors of the University
Library System. 1

GSPIA Student Cabinet memberjonathan
Livingston believes these numbers don’t
accurately represent the value of the library
to students. He said the GSPIA library is far
quieter than Hillman Library —— the GSPIA
co1lection’s future residence. Livingston also

Marie DeAeth:

worried about the sort of effect the library’s
closing could have on GSPIA’s reputation.

“The top 15 — top 20 — programs in
the country have their own libraries,” he
said. GSPIA is currentlysranked 27th in the
country for public affairs by the latest report
from U.S. News 8: World Report.

GSPIA also ranked 16th in the to-p U.S.
master’s programs for international rela-
tions for 2009, according to the magazine
Foreign Policy. l

A Livingsto n’s fellow cabinet member, Ma-

 

Hillman to take books

rie DeAeth, created a petition requesting
that administrators allow GSPIA students
to offer input on how the library space, once
cleared, will be used.

“We weren’t consulted at all, and we are
the stakeholders,” she said.

DeAeth’s petition currently has about
150 signatures. ' ’

‘ “We know that this library is going to
close, but we’d like to be in some dialogue,”
she said. “We’d like to reserve some of th-at
space for a quiet study space”;

Livingston said heheard some prelimi-

nary plans for the space include'expa_nding
a GSPIA classroom and the school’s related

, Center of Excellence. He believes that while

expansions to GSPIA are positive, they don’t

make up for the loss "of easy access to re— ,

i 

  

sources and quiet study space.

Dlejong said GSPIA’s books and resources
will still'be available‘ through the Hillman
Library. Dejong was unable to comment
on future uses for the library space or why
the University needed the space, but said
that ﬁnding quiet studyspace elsewhere
for students is something administration
is working on as the ‘closure process moves
forward. T

“We always want to be sure we are making
the most efficient use of space possible.” Eﬁ

I Opinions  

Don’t overfill

hese days, high school stu-

I dents so commonly com-

‘ plain about overstretched

workloads and underutilized pil-

lows that we often consider their

griping as cliché —— and subse-

quently dismiss it. But as one docu-

mentary suggests, we should per-
haps be a bit more considerate.

The documentary, titled “Race

to Nowhere,” is a ﬁlm that, ac-

cording to an article in The New

York Times, “portrays the pres-

sures when schools pile on hours '

of homework, coaches turn sports
into year—round obligations and
parents pack their children off to
music and computer camps during
summer.”

Focusing on how an increasing
number of parents and students,

_ especially in affluent areas, treat

high school purely as a resumé-
building exercise, the ﬁlm de-
scribes “boys who drop out of high
school from pressure, girls who
suffer stress-induced insomnia”
and students who decide to borrow
friends’ prescriptions of Adderall
.— a psychomotor stimulant —_
to focus on an overloaded plate of

I commitments.

Although sporting a small ad-
vertizing budget, the documen-
tary .has- nevertheless received a
groundswell of grassroots support,
from students and parents alike.
Earning $6.3 million already at the
box office, “Race to Nowhere” has
been privately screened by com-
munity groups and local Parent
Teacher Associations, which sell
tickets alongside the ﬁlmmakers.

Ballooning application rates are
making top-tier colleges more re-
strictive, and school districts are
increasingly forcing higher col-
legiate expectations onto students

your plate . 

so as to boost land value and, by
extension, tax revenue. These
factors, among others, are clear-
ly turning high school environ-
ments into hotbeds of unhealthy
competition, where students are
taught they need to do everything
to “get in.” A

But don’t be mistaken; this ten-
dency toward over-involvement
often ‘does not end by getting ac-
cepted into college.

As a tough job market knocks
threateningly on their door, many

A undergrads struggle to pad their

resumés in the same way these high
school students do. By cramming
activities and classes into their
schedules, some students never
shake the desire to do it all, and
they’re not better off for it.
Though a college education,

especially an undergraduate ex— .

periencein the liberal arts, should

encourage students to explore-

the many facets of their interests
and abilities, in college there is a
point — which can be reached

- very quickly — at which a resumé-

padding exercise just collapses.
Those who approached high
school in a do-everything-until-

"you-literally-drop fashion will

ﬁnd that college activities require

‘ a level of focus, commitment and

zeal that vastly surpasses that of
former activities, and stringing to-
gether too many things is simply
unsustainable. More people should
understand that.“well—rounded”
can also translate into a person
who focuses on one life passion,
performs a few hours of volunteer-
ing on the side and gets nine hours
of sleep per night. Employers and
graduate programs are looking for
excellence in a few key skills, not
necessarily mediocrity in many.I

SOME UNOONVENTIONAL WISDOM

WikiLeaks founder
is no war criminal

   

Jacob Brown
Columnist

In paying attention to the whole
W1kiLeaks controversy that has led to
approximately 900 secret diplomatic
documents beingneleasedtothe public
overthe pasttwo weeks, Ican’t help but
feel bad for the site’s founder, Julian
Assange.

Maybe he showboatedabitwithhis
newfound notoriety, callingfor the re-
movalofSecreta1yofStateHillaryClin-

ton in Time magazine for her alleged ’

espionage assignment overtheUnited
Nations. And maybe his overzealous
grandstanding on the international
stage in newspapers like the Guard-
ian and Der Spiegel has made him a
bit of atarget. I
ButIthinkhisW1kiLeakshavepro-
videdthe resurgenceinreportingthat
journalism needstosurviveinthe 21st
century. His website has also forced
diplomats to adhere to a greater level
of accountability than they have for

-.-.,.._,-,r,

quite some time.
Unfortunately, no one else seems
to agreewith me. ,
AccordingtheAssociatedPress, the
Swedish server that hosts W1kiLeaks
has come under widespread attack

since Assange made the armounce—,

ment last month that his site became
the recipient of more than 250,000

documents. Paypal also cutotfits asso-

ciation with W1kiLeaks this pastweek
after receiving pressure from the U.S.
government. ‘

To make matters worse, Interpol
released awarrantforAssange’sarrest

charges.

Text lingo pervades broader discourse

Katie Azzara
Columnist

 

There is an ever—thinr/iing line be-
tween proper English grammar and
texting lingo.

A friend of mine recently told me
an interesting story involving a re-
quest he made to a young employee
ofhis. After repeating the same direc-
tions many times without aresponse,
he decided thatane-mail mightbe the
best way to get the message across to
her. Thinking he would try to relate
to her youth, he sent her a message
that included the phrase “OMG” and
multiple exclamation points. _

Of course, the young employee
was so upset + there might even

- have been tears involved — that my

friend ended up getting reprimanded.
This story is telling enough in itself,
but my friend’s comments regarding
the situation afterward really struck
a chord.

He wondered how much worse
the employee’s reaction would have
been if he had picked up the phone
and actually yelled at her. Or —— God

forbid —- if he had told her what she
was doingwrong to her face. He pre-
dicted that she simply would have
melted into a ball of goo. V
Have people of our generation
really become so overly sensitive?
More and more, we see this kind of

— thing happening all the time. Our
Vgeneration seems to be especially

responsive to the written word, a
fact that is more than likely a direct
result of constant texting and social

networking on sites like Facebook,

where communication between
peers occurs mainly through typed
messages.

Things such as subtle facial ex-
pression and voice inﬂection, which
are easy to pick up on in spoken con-
versation, must be much more exag-
gerated inwritten form. We overuse
punctuation, capitalization and the
like in our texts andwallposts so as to
avoid ambiguity. But this comes with
the risk ofbecoming overly analytical
about someone’s real intentions.

Today’s youth read into written
words and communication in much
the same way that people have always

read into certain facial expressions

_or vocal intonations. Think about

it. Have you ever assumed that your -
friend or signiﬁcant other was mad
at you simply because he or she didn’t
include any punctuation in his or her
text message? I know I have.

And you can’t say that you don’t
feel at least a little disappointed every
time someone answers a text with a
simple “o ” Not only is it boring, but

~ many people take personal offense to

And while we’re on the topic of
emoticons, there are some people,
and I’m sure you know at least one of
them, who ﬁnd it necessaryto include ..
some sort of smiley symbol in every
text, e—mail or wall post. Though in
the past this may have seemed a bit
over the top, these days it’s common-
place for a smiley to indicate the tone
of the message. Happy face for ex-
cited, sad face for depressed, winking
face for, well, other occasions.

Our generation seems to be

such a concise response.

. Personally, Iialways like to add a
little ﬂair to my wall posts andtext
messages. Itend to overuse exclama-
tion points in order to better convey
meaning. That is, of course, unless

. the tone of the message is somber,

in which case theuse of a sad face
is in order.

eespecially responsive to the
Written Word. A

With all of these changes in punc-
tuation, capitalization and smiley-
face use, texting and Internet lingo
is bound.to carry over into other
aspects of life. And according to a
recent Chicago Tribune article, this
is now happening in college class-
rooms. 7

The article focuses on the idea

, that not only are students becom-
ing unacceptably informal in e-mails '

to professors, but the casual tone of
texts, social networking sites and
even Internet shorthand lingo is car-
rying over into their academic work
and formal writing assignments.

According to USA Today, younger -

teens, who have had exposure to cell
phones and texting for the majority
of their lives, are having even more
issues keeping texting language and
abbreviations from creeping into
their schoolwork.

The fact that written words are
starting to elicit the same responses,
analyses and preoccupations that
face-to—face interactions is just one
indicator of the lessening difference
between texting lingo and English.

Of course, as long as we know
where to draw the line between the
virtual world and the real world,

. these blurred lines should remain

rather harmless. Whether that’s pos-
sible in our ever-more technological
society is another issue entirely.

said Western powers should have no
worries about publicizing materials.
“[They] have ﬁscali[z]ed its basic
power relationships through a web of

holdings and so on,” he said. “In such
anenvironmentitis easyfor speech to
be ‘free’ because a change in political
will rarely leads to any change inthese
basic instruments. Western speech, as

' something that rarely has any effect

on power, is, like badgers and birds,

He added that by comparison, “In

sorship, because speech stillhas power

Assange didn’t hack any websites.

our government should ask itselfwhere
the oversightwas on these supposedly
top secret memos. _
So far, though, no documents have
even posed athreat. The most contro-
versial cables we have seenareafew in-
tercepted rniddle-school-style “I don’t
like you” notes from Middle East and
SoutheastAsian allies directed towards
their uranium-enriching neighbors.
It’s almost as if the government didn’t
think we knew as much anyway.

The cables also uncovered a story
of a75-year-old American doctorwho
escaped from Iran imprisonment on
horseback alter bribing drug dealers
to take him into Turkey. You can bet
on seeingthe story on the silver screen
over the next few years. -

None ofthe cables have been mon -

AChristmas classic revisite

Larissa Gula
Staﬁ” Writer

“A Musical Christmas Carol”
Dec. 9-23 V

- Directed by Tim Gregory

Byham Theater
Tickets: $26.75-$46.75

412-456-6666 or online at pitts-

burghCLO.org

For many actors and audiences, De-
cember means not only the holidays,
but also an opportunity to revisita
favorite reformed miser — Ebenezer
Scrooge.

Pittsburgh CLO presents its 19th
installment of “A Musical Christmas
Carol” this month, with most of its
cast returning to take on new char-
acters or reprise old ones. Actor Tom
Atkins, for example, will reassume
his role as Scrooge. , _

The show is one of countless ad-
aptations of Charles Dickens’ novella

MOVIE COLUMN 

about Scrooge, a curmudgeon who
receives a series of visits from the
ghosts of Christmas past, present,
and future on Christmas Eve. He
begins learning about himself and
what his future will hold for him if
he does not change his tune — “Bah,
humbug!” — and greedy ways.
The story overall captures the

‘ joy of the holidays and .the musical

remains loyal to the original plot,
according to director Tim Gregory,
who has a history with the ‘show,
both acting in it and directing an-
other adaptation for ﬁve years in
Washington. 7 l

“I think families would certainly ~

appreciate this version,” Gregory
said about the production. “It’s pret-
ty loyal. Of course there are always
additions, because the music does
not exist in the novella that Dickens
wrote.”

The theme, however, remains
the power of transformation that
Scrooge embodies, according to

Tybout crafts” surprising movie mashups

Andy Tybout
Assistant Ac‘;-E Editor

“Black Swan” director Darren
Aronofsky may be a director in
profession, but he has the heart of

. a mashup artist.

After all, how else could you
explain the fact that Aronofsky
originally conceived “Black Swan”
and “The Wrestler” as one movie?
To many, this concept seems hor-
ribly incongruous: “The Wrestler”
is a humble, humane drama ﬁrmly
ensconced in real life; “Black Swan,”
if the reviews are to be believed, is a
morbid, Kafka—esque horror ﬁlm.

For the record, Aronofsky had
a surprisingly reasonable justiﬁ-
cation for the hybrid: “They [the
two movies] are really connected
and people will see the connections.
It’s funny, because wrestling some
consider the lowest art — if they
would even call it art — and ballet
some people consider the highest
art. But what was amazing to me

was how similar the performers in
both of these worlds are. They both
make incredible use of their bodies
to express themselves.”

To me, this explanation begs the
question: What really unites ﬁlms?
What makes them cohesive? Is it
theme, as Aronofsky seems to be
suggesting, or something more con-
crete (setting, characters, plot)?

To test the limits of this theory,
I’ve compiled a list of ﬁlm “remixes”
— cinematic pairings that might
cohere based on Aronofsky’s logic.

_If not stitched somehow together
by a postmodernmad scientist, the
below movies should at least be ex-
perienced in succession.

“Fight Club” and “Persona”: This
pairing might offend fans of revered
Swedish auteur Ingmar Bergman,
who usually shudder at ‘macho cult
ﬂicks like David Fincher’s “Fight
Club.” It’s hard to extract a cogent
synopsis from the former, but if
pressed to summarize, “Persona”
is the story of a renowned actress,
Elisabeth, who has abruptly stopped

speaking, and the attempts of her
young nurse, Alma, to treat her ail-
ment in an isolated vacation house
Nevertheless, Fincher’s pulpy, vis-
ceral classic and Bergman’s moody
art house drama occupy-the same
sentence because they both probe
issues of identity, albeit in very dif-
ferent manners.

Not to tarnish these ﬁlms with
spoilers, but at the termination of
both, it turns out that individual
identities are less distinct than ei-
ther set of protagonists would care
to believe — as are the identities of
“Fight Club” and “Persona” them-
selves.

“Apocalypse Now” and “Barton
Fink”: The classic Vietnam epic and
the Coen brothers’ black comedy
about a writer in Hollywood are, as
is also the case with many musical
remixes, superﬁcially incompatible.
However, both chart a joumeyﬁinto
a modern hell — in “Apocalypse
Now” the hell is physical (Kurtz’s
camp); in “Barton Fink,” partly
mental and partly physical (Fink

is in disarray at the end, and in a

somewhat heavy—handed turn of '

events, his hotel ﬂoor catches ﬁre).
And like all good corruption sagas,
both “Apocalypse” and “Barton”
feature some memorably depraved
sequences: In fact, the former can
almost be reduced to a‘ series of
gruesome episodes. To avoid spoil-
ing the latter, I’ll simply say that a
very different side ofjohn Goodman
is on display.

“Being John Malkovich” and
“The Truman Show”: Voyeurism is a
theme that “Beingjohn Malkovich”
—— a ﬁlm in which a downtrodden

man and his co—worker discover a‘

tunnelthat leads directly to John
Malkovich’s mind, enabling them

to control him — doesn’t so much i

explore as it does tackle head—on.
Conversely, “The Truman Show”
can credibly be deemed a movie
about several themes —— fate, in-
dependence, truth. The title char-
acters in both ﬁlms, however, are
the subjects of a people’s unremit-
ting meddling — at the expense

of their own health and sanity, the
desires, dreams and aspirations of
a plurality are channeled into an
unfortunate individual.

“8 1/2” and “Synecdoche, New
York”: Federico Fellini’s 1963 ma§=
terpiece and Charlie Kaufman’s con-
temporary epic abound in similari-
ties: both ﬁlms feature protagonists

‘ struggling quixotically to realize

their magnum opus — in the for-
mer, the protagonist is a movie
director; in the latter, a theatre di-
rector. Loved ones are alienated,
money is wasted and unwieldy,
otherworldly sets take shape.
Naturally, a distinct metaﬁc—

'tional strain permeates both ﬁlms

—— “Synecdoche,” in particular, istx
dense hall of theoretical mirrors -

and to wrap your mind around their

narrative_architecture requires a

discipline not usually demanded of
audiences. For rnind—bending rumi-

nations on the relationship betweeg,
art and life, “8 1/2”..and “Synecdo-

che” make for an impressive — if
imposing — doubleheader.

ALBUM REVIEW

My Chemical Romance takes
on new personas in album

Sarah Simkin
Senior Stajf Writer

My Chemical Romance

Danger Days: The True Lives of the
Fabulous Killjoys

Warner Bros. and Reprise Records
Rocks like: All-grown-up emo
Grade: A-

~ If one band from our high school days has sur-

vived, it’s probably the My Chemical Romance.

But lately, the group doesn’t sound quite the A

same as it did when we listed it as one of our
favorites on MySpace.

My Chemical Romance’s fourth studio album
Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous
Killjoys exhibits stronginstrumental, vocal and
compositional talent belied by its emo roots. It

I isn’t an easy evolution to pull off, but My Chemi-

cal Romance has attacked the challenge with
aplomb. V .

The album kicks off with a brief intro track
that segues seamlessly into the ﬁrst real song, a
technique previously employed on the band’s last
album The Black Parade to merge the album’s
concept and narrative storyline with otherwise
standalone tracks. V ‘

This latest album chronicles the exploits of a
group of outlaws — the “Fabulous Killjoys” — in
California inthe year2o19 and the group’s ﬁght
against the evil corporation Better Living Indus-

tries. It is guided on its crusade by Mindless Self A

Indulgences Steven Montano under the alias of
pirate radio DJ Dr. Death Defying.

Sound like a comic book? This is not a big
surprise considering that front man Gerard

Way moonlights as the writer of the Umbrella
Academy comic book series, but let’s examine
the album’s musical caliber ratherthan its elabo-
rate backstory. ' -

“Planetary (Go!)” and “SING” stand out as
anthems with tremendous riffs, swelling chords
and spooky sound effects.

“Na Na Na (Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na)”
— yes, that’s the real song title — contains
suspect lyrics bordering on psychobabble, but
no stranger or less effective than the ﬁagment—
poetry-esque style the band has previously
employed to great effect. Even “Shut up and
let me see your jazz hands / Remember when
you were a madman? / Thought you was Bat-
man” can be more or less redeemed by a jumpy
catchy chorus. , _

“Vampire Money” is the band’s belligerent
response to being asked to contribute a song
to the “Twilight” ﬁlm franchise soundtrack —
hint: They declined. Lyrics like “Play the game
andtakc the band realfar/ Play it right and drive
a Volvo car” are less than poetic, but the band’s
mockeryis entertaining. ,

The Dr. Death Defying monologue interludes
reel toward the bizarre, and most listeners will
probably skip past them after an initial explor-
atory listen.

My Chemical Romance is never quite the
same band twice, a concept it has  played
up by adapting alter egos: Previously itwas The
Black Parade, now it is —— arnbitiously — both
the Fabulous Killjbys and The Mad Gear and
Missile Kid, whichever -role the album’s story
requires the group to play .

Is it high art? Maybe not. Is it a far cry bet-
ter than what one might have expected? Ab-
solutely. . ,

Gregory.

“You see someone go from one place to
another, into the complete opposite of what
they have been,” he said. “To be redeemed is a
powerful thing to observe and experience.”

Pitt alumna Allison Scarletjaye plays Mrs.
Cratchit, welcomed by the cast and crew for
her debut with Pittsburgh CLO._]aye graduated
from Pitt in 2006 with a degree in humani-

A ties but also with plenty of acting experience,

having aspired to be an actress from a young
age. A

“I felt verymuch a part of the theater
community even though I wasn’t technically
a theater major, and my post—college life is due
in part because of the advice of the theater
department,” she said.

The musical production has offered Jaye

a wonderful experience behind the scenes as

well as on stage, she said.
“Everyone is warm and welcoming and

. ﬁm,” she said. “We’re all peers. Each member

is an integral part of telling the story and this
show wouldn’t be the same without the street
vendor or the last little kid.”

“From behind the scenes, being at re-
hearsal and practicing the songs and jok-
ing around while being focused, the sense
of togetherness we have is also part of the
story and the moral. Without each other we
are nothing, and Scrooge discovers this after

isolating himself off and ruining quite a few
relationships and opportunities because he
wasn’t with anyone.”

And though ]aye’s biggest challenge is
learning all the verses to English carols she
otherwise wouldn’t know all the way through,

Caitlin Elizabeth Reilly:

I think that joy is
a huge strength of
the production.

the music is a crucial element in the produc-
tion. _

“It’s a story everyone knows, told in a vivid
and visceral way,” Jaye said. “We connect to
carols. We’ve been singing them since we were
little. But it’s also new. There are things myste-
rious about the show or even magical. It’s the
way of watchinga private scene we all connect
to and relate to. I say, bring tissues.”

Caitlin Elizabeth Reilly is returning to “A
Musical Christmas Carol” for her seventh run
with the production. She is taking on the roles
of Miss Watkins and Martha Cratchit. With
a family in Pittsburgh that has always been

involved in theater, Reilly acted in the produc-
tion as a child from 1995 to 1998 and took on
other roles every few years.

“This show really is my absolute favorite
show,” Reilly said. “The majority of the cast are

people who have known me since I was a kid. I A

live in Philadelphia, so I come home to do the
show and be with my parents. It’s part of the

V tradition. The family has seen the show a ton

of times. It’s. a major part of the holidays.”

For Reilly, the challenge is to stay in char-
acter —— and not regress and say the lines she
would have said in a different role.’

“I’ve never played these characters, so it’s
kind of interesting and it’s hard to not go back
to what I was doing before,” Reilly said. “There
are scenes I used to do as old characters where
I have to hold bac .” ,

Just likejaye, Reilly has had minimal prob-
lems adapting to the new role and feels a sense
of togetherness with the cast. She’s conﬁdent
that audiences will feel genuine holiday joy

and spirit from the cast as they perform “A

Musical Christmas Carol.”

“The kids on stage are adorable and fun
to work with, and the cast genuinely likes
each other,” Reilly said. “This is clear to the
audience that we’re a big family and we laugh
more than most productions of a show would.
I think that joy is a huge strength of the pro-
duction.” I P

3-point shooting team, Panthers 1
head coach Jamie Dixon took a ‘

aylor leads Panthers to big Win

timeout in order to emphasize the
importance of defense.

“At the timeout, Coach told us
‘Don’t let anybody shoot over you,

_keep your hands up,’ and that’s
. what we did from that point on

throughout the whole game,”

4? freshman JLJ. Moore said after

the game. . i ; I

A series of missed layups cost
the Panthers» some early momen-
tum, and as a result the score re-
mained tied until the last eight
minutes of the ﬁrst half.

Cue Dante Taylor.

In a game. in which regular‘

stand- outs like Ashton Gibbs, Brad
Wanamaker and McGhee were

relatively quiet, Taylor stepped

over Delaware State

up to ﬁll in. .

With a forceﬁil put—back buck-
et, he sparked the beginning of
what would be a 13-0 Pitt run with
just under10 minutes to go in the
ﬁrst half.

Taylor, who ﬁnished with his
ﬁrst career double-double, ‘col-
lected 14 pointsand pulled down
16 rebounds. He had a distinct
height advantage over all of the
Delaware State forwards. «

“This was deﬁnitely the biggest’
height advantage I’ve had so far,’_f
Taylor said after the game. “I’m
deﬁnitely more comfortable. I’m
working hard in practice and -it’s
carrying over. I know I’m not going
to be in there for the whole game,’

so I have to make the most of the

time when I am.”

Dixon has been very encour-
agedby the production he sees
from Taylor. . .

“He is doing a good job of
ﬁnishing around the basket, and.
making free throws. He had a great
freshman year and he’s improved
from there,” he said. ‘‘It’s great
to see his development. He only
played 15 minutes. He is a great
kid and a great player, too,” Dixon
said after the game. _

‘player for the Panthers. Coming

off the bench, Moore played 19
minutes, ﬁnished with 10 points

GiLegorian Rants

Blue Devils will be tough to beat thisseason

Greg Trietley
Senior Staﬁ” Writer

 

Undefeated and the reigning national cham-

_ pions, the No. 1 Duke Blue Devils are the gold

standard of college basketball.

Any team that wants to be No. 1 '— namely
No. 2 Ohio State, No. 3 Pitt and No. 4 Kansas
— has to bide its time and wait for the Blue
Devils to lose a game.

With the darlings of Durham scoring near-
ly 90 points per contest entering Wednesday
night’s matchup against Bradley, a loss might
not come for a while.

The -1975-76. Indiana Hoosiers were the
last team to go undefeated. The ACC is down
this year —— Duke is the only ranked team —

but the idea of the Blue Devils running the V

table is still far-fetched. Head coach Mike

Krzyzewski is the ﬁrst to admit it. “There’s no

way our team would be able do that,” he told

Jason King of Yahoo Sports last week.

That just about covers it: the Blue Dev-

ils will lose sometime. But when? Let’s go.
through the schedule.

Dec. 11 vs. St. Louis (3-3), Dec. 20 vs.
Elon (2-5), Dec. 29 at UNC Greensboro

(0-7)

Duke played Bradley Wednesday night at
9 p.m., and I can only assume the Blue Devils
won to kick off the easiest portion of their

. schedule. Consider it their break. They played

Marquette, Kansas State, Oregon, Michigan
State and Butler all in a row. It’s probably for
the best that they sprinkled some mid—maj or
opponents into their schedule.

rapins beat the Blue Devils in their meeting
last March. They could have beaten Pitt this

' year had they made a free throw in the ﬁrst

half. The 6-3 record is misleading.

A They did lose star player Greivis Vasquez
after last season, and they don’t have the
depth that the Blue Devils have. It will take a
magniﬁcent effort and some great coaching to

. outdo Duke, but they have two chances.

Upset odds: The vertical leap of
Gilbert Brown in inches to 1.

Fun fact: Elon and UNC Greensboro play
in the “Southern, North,” the Southern Con-

ference’s— northern division. Unfortunately, ‘

neither team seems to win often, or in UNC

Greensboro’s case, win ever. _ .
Upset odds: The vertical leap of Gilbert

Brown in inches to 1. ' '

Feb. 26 at Virginia Tech (4-4)

The Hokies were second in the ACC Pre-
season Poll, but they pulled aPitt football and

_ lost every one of their important early games

despite guard Malcolm Delaney averaging
over 20 points per game. They also suffered

4- an ugly loss to Virginia on Sunday.

Virginia Tech doesn’t play Duke until late
February, so the teamhas plenty of time to

_ ‘P
round into shape around Delaney. And with
the game at Virginia Tech, if the Blue Devils
are stillundefeated, you can bet it’ll be a hos-
tile atmosphere for themto play in.

Upset odds: Marc-Andre Fleury’s goals-
against average to 1. . . V

March 5 at North Carolina (5-3)

If the Blue Devils make it this far unde-
feated, they’ll have already beaten the Tar
Heels in February. But you’d have to throw
that game out for the rematch, as well as the
records of each team. When it comes to Duke
and North Carolina, the stats don’t mean
anything, or so the clichéd North Carolin-
ians tell me.

‘The Tar Heels would be playing for pride.
The Blue Devils have blown by them in terrn_,.§,;~_.,
of results since they won the NCAA Tourna-
ment in 2009. They can’t let them stroll into
the 2011 Tournament undefeated. If the Blue
Devils make it to the ﬁnal weekend of the
regular season without a loss, it’s only ﬁtting
that North Carolina will be the team that gives
one to them.

Unfortunately for Ohio State, Pitt, Kansas
and the other top teams that hoped to earn
that illustrious ‘No. 1 ranking, they’ll have
lost by then too. I p ‘
