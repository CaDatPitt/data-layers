With a simple twist of the
wrist, students and faculty
could make it possible to
charge books, meals, gain
access to Pitt events and
possibly draw cash from
automatic teller machines
all with one identification
card.

The‘ new cards being envi-

faculty, staff and students
would contain a magnetic
strip holding a wide range of
information, from social
security numbers to deter-
mining an immediate change

By Sandra Bennett
For The Pitt News

When most students were in grade school,
they didn’t use computers or take a lot of field
trips —— but at Pitt, some do.

These are some of the things children at the
Falk Laboratory School have done this year
along with ﬂying paper airplanes as part of a
lesson on transportation, making silk scarves in
art class and playing games to make math fun.

The school is part of the University of
Pittsburgh’s School of Education. It is located
behind Pitt Stadium, across from the Veterans’
Hospital. ' .

Since 1930, the school has served as a train-
ing facility for teachers, while providing a place
where children in kindergarten through eighth
grade can learn in a progressive environment.
The school’s faculty and staff are employees of
the university, and some teach classes in the
School of Education. ’

Cassie Berarducci is a graduate student at Pitt

-who is currently working for one year as a stu-

dent intern at Falk. As anintem, she is responsi-
ble for teaching a class of kindergarten and first
grade students, as well as attending faculty and
Parent Teacher Association meetings.

Berarducci said she is excited about the envi-
ronment at Falk.

‘This school has such a high enthusiasm and
love for school. You see kids in here that come
in with smiles on their faces,” she said.

Laurie Williams, Berarducci’s mentor teacher
at Falk, agreed.

“The teachers are dedicated and still enthusi-
astic about teaching,” Vtrilliams said.

Class sizes are limited to about 24 students.
Each class is staffed with a teacher and one or
two student interns. This high teacher-to-student
ratio allows each child individualized attention.

Independent thinking is emphasized at the
school. Students are encouraged to make their
own decisions and choose their own activities,
within the teachers’ limits.

they will have 30 days to object to the

team we’re trying to get
viewpoints from everyone,”
said project director Dennis
DeSantis.

The team consists of both 3

the College of General
Studies and graduate student
governments as well as fac-
ulty and administrators.

They’ve been working on
a plan since fall and will
submit a preliminary propos-
al by the end of this month
to Associate Vice Chancellor
of Budget and
Administration Joe Gil. The
goal is to have a new system
intact by this time next year,"
said DeSantis.

For The Pitt News

The U.S. Department of Education
will soon be claiming part of those stu-
dents’ paychecks who have defaulted
on their loans, even if the student does
not surrender it willingly through a new
repayment plan.

Starting as early as next month, the
Education Department will offer stu-
dents who have defaulted on their loans
an opportunity to arrange a monthly
repayment plan based on their income.

Defaulters who fail to arrange a
repayment plan within a few weeks will
receive a garnishment notice in the
mail, said Stephanie Babyak, a
spokesperson for the department. Then

proposed garnishment before it is put
into action and the‘ Education
Department starts collecting on their
defaulted loan.

U.S. Secretary of Education Richard
Riley said the new repayment plan is an
affordable way for students to get back
into good standing with the Education
Department, banks and credit bureaus.
Those who don’t opt for the new repay-
ment plan, Riley said, face “serious
sanctions,” like wage garnisheement.

According to Riley, there are now
very few good excuses fordefaulting
on a loan.

“Some defaulters don’t repay their
loans because they can’t afford the
monthly payment,” Riley said. “We

ble borrowers to make affordable pay-
ments.” -

In addition to wage garnishment,
defaulters, at least in 1995, are still
subject to federal income tax refund
offset by the Internal Revenue Service,

\Babyak said. In other words, the

defaulted borrowers’ federal income tax
refunds will be used to pay off their
debt with the Education Department.
Babyak was unsure whether the
Education Department would continue
using federal income tax refund offset
in 1996 to collect on defaulted loans.
Collecting on defaulted loans through
the Internal Revenue Service has been a
highly successful venture, according to

LONDON — Salman Rushdie,
author of “The Satanic Verses,”
announced on Tuesday that the
world should urge Iran to lift the
death threat placed on him by
the now-dead Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini.

The “fatwa” or death sentence
was placed on Rushdie because
of his book, “The Satanic
Verses,” which Muslims felt
made fun of the prophet
Mohammed.

Rushdie urged the world to
put pressure on the Iranian gov-

WASHINGTON ,
Representatives for both the FBI
and the Drug Enforcement
Agency predicted that the U.S.
crime rate is going to get worse
before it gets better.

Both groups announced their

findings during a Senate
Judiciary Committee, as
Republicans prepare to rewrite
the crime bill.

Their findings are based on
the rising number of teenagers
between the ages of 14 to 17
who commit violent crime.
Violent crime rates for teenagers
are double that of adult levels,
with drug use being more of a
factor.

FBI director Louis Freeh esti-
mated that the number of
teenagers committing violent
crimes is expected to rise 20
percent by the year 2000. —

cancer.

Scientists identified two genes
that are linked to breast cancer
and have managed to isolate one
of the genes, BRCA1.

These genes, however, are not

Advisory committee focuses on women's concerns

By Regan Morris
For The Pitt News

The Provost’s Advisory Committee
on Women’s Concerns has been active
in directing attention to pertinent
issues concerning women on campus
since its creation in 1983.

The committee acts to serve the
provost and the university community
by identifying, exploring and recom-
mending solutions to problems and
issues that affect women at Pitt.
PACWC attempts to draw a broad
range of women for membership.

“PACWC is in an interesting situa-
tion,” said Anna Roman-Koller, exec-
utive administrator of the pathology
department and current co-chair of
PACWC. “We are an advisory com-

mittee, so we have no decision making

power. PACWC’s strength is that it
draws -women from all over campus.
You have 35 women that represent
most of the University of -Pittsburgh.
Other than the faculty senate, you
don’t get that wide representation very
often.”

Professor Katheryn Linduff of the
history of art and architecture depart-
ment is also co-chair of PACWC. '

The committee focuses on issues
such as the recruitment and ‘promo-
tion of women faculty, staff recogni-
tion, career development, salary equi-
ty, sexual harassmentand sexual
assault.

Sexual harassment was PACWC’s
focus issue for 1993-94.

‘ “PACWC was one of the most impor-

tant groups recommending to the

provost that a sexual assault task force
be created,” said Anne Rawlinson,
assistant to the provost. “They recom-
mended that the Sexual Assault
Coordinator position be created with a
budget to go along with it, and the
chancellor approved which was great.”

Mary Koch Ruiz was named last
spring as the director of Pitt’s Sexual
Assault Services.

Current Provost James Maher “has
been very interested in what PACWC
has to say,” said Rawlinson.

“Most provost’s over the history of
PACWC have been very supportive,”
said Roman- '

   

“It’s been very frustrating,” said
Julie Crowell, Student Government
Board president and member of
PACWC. “[Women’s Studies] isn’t
even a department, it’s a program.
There’s no full-time director. There’s
just two research assistant professors.
It’s not even a job, you just have to
teach one less class.”

“A lot of effort has been wasted,”
said Crowell, who has been research-
ing the option of a Women’s Studies
major. “When you do find informa-
tion, there’s no one to give it to,
there’s no director.”

Koller. . . PACWC
“P A C W C focuses on
has never l  I  different
been a token issues and
committee. - c o n c e r n s

“These are not the kind of women
that would just do something that
looks good on a resume. It’s because
they really have a need to see that
women’s issues are heard.”

PACWC is divided into three sub-
committees for students, faculty and
staff.

Special committees are created to
address specific issues, such as the
child care committee, which was
instrumental in increasing the size of
the Child Development Center.

PACWC meets three times'a term
with the subcommittees meeting in
between.

The student affairs committee has
been working with the Women’s
Studies Program to look into hiring a
full-time director for the program.

each year. -
“PACWC has a life of its own,” said
Roman-Koller. “When I was first
asked to chair, I had all these ideas
that we’d do workshops so that
women would understand what they
had to do to get tenure. But the
Faculty Affairs Committee decided
that they wanted to actually look at
what the impact of tenure  has been
on women.” .

“It has got a life of its own and it
depends on its membership,” said
Roman-Koller describing PACWC.
“You can go out thinking that this is
what we’re going to get done this
year, but it really moves with what’s
going on on campusand the interests
of all the women.”

A major issue PACWC has been

, focusing oniin 1994-95 is the idea of a

university women’s center.

“The women’s center is one of the
very big issues this year, and PACWC
is very concerned about it,” said
Rawlinson. “But our feeling is that the
chancellor is not going to approve
something unless it is evident that
groups across the university really
want it to be there, that there’s a very
clear mission for it and that it doesn’t
duplicate other services that are
already at the university.”

Pitt’s Counseling Center in the
William Pitt Union already offers per-
sonal andcareer counseling for
women and a women’s group.

“The women’s center issue is one

A that really has to have a student grass-

root,” said Roman-Koller. “If you look

back over the history of why the

development center became such an
issue and got a really great director is
because it was graduate students who
started it and brought the issue up. It
has to have a big grassroot. Although
PACWC can show an interest in [a
women’s center] and we can help
develop a policy for it, we can’t
implement it.”

A women’s center would “be a place
where women could go and get infor-
mation. There would be a research
center,” said Roman-Koller.

Roman-Koller also said the center
will be hard to do in these days of
“budget*crunches,” but “that’s not to
say it’s not doable. It would have to be
really planned out and have real spe-
cific functions. That’s what’s being
developed this year.” .

Falk

°From page 1
In Williams and Berarducci’s
classroom, the students can
move to different stations twice
a day, choosing between listen-

ing to tapes, working on com-.

puters or reading books.

The administration encourages
teachers to get children out of
the classroom, according to
Berarducci, and the lack of
bureaucracy allows her to take
her class on a field trip when-
ever she thinks it would be bene-
ﬁcial.

“When I feel it’s necessary to
take these kids on a ﬁeld trip, I
mark it on the calendar in the
office. They get the busses and
we go,” Berarducci said.

Currently, Berarducci is teach-
ing her class about transporta-
tion. She has taken the children
on a Gateway Clipper ride to
learn about boats and had a pilot
talk to them about air travel. She
also recently took them on a tour
of the Port Authority Transit to
learn about the city's bus system.

Research is an important com-
ponent of the Falk School.

University students and faculty
who would normally have a dif-
ficult time carrying out educa-
tional research in a large school
district can come to Falk to con-
duct their studies, according to
school director Roy Creek.

“We provide an environment
where research can take place
with a minimum of red tape,”
said Creek.

Tuition at Falk is about $4,500
a year, which Creek said is sig-
niﬁcantly less than other private

’ schools in the area such as Ellis

or Shadyside Academy.

Creek said he tells parents
who are interested in sending
their children to Falk to come in
and look at the school and
decide if the teacher education
and research will benefit their
child.

According to Creek, most par-
ents who choose to enroll their
children are happy to learn that
the school is constantly trying
innovative ideas. _

“Laboratory schools have the
obligation to seek new knowl-
edge,” Creek said.

However, Babyak said

[l'1CI'C WCIC COl'lCCI'IlS that-

some defaulted borrowers
who were aware of the
plan rearranged their
withholdings to avoid a
tax refund. Thus, the
Education Department
had no money from which
to'collect.

Defaulters who estab-
lish and honor a repay-
ment plan with the
Education Department
can avoid offset of federal

income tax refunds,
Babyak said. .
Babyak added that

*defaulters still are ren-

dered ineligible for feder-
al student aid including
loans and grants, have
their default status report-
ed to credit bureaus and
risk being denied credit

cards or other loans.

Last year, the depart-
ment collected $598 mil-
lion through the IRS from
an estimated 780,000 tax-
payers who were in
default on a student loan.

Defaulted student loans
cost taxpayers $2.4 billion
in fiscal year 1994, down
from an all-time high of
$3.6 billion in 1991.

Leo Kornfeld, the edu-
cation secretary’s senior
adviser, said, “I encour-
age individuals who may
have defaulted loans to
take advantage of this
opportunity to repay their
loans at an amount they
can afford and get back

Crowell said, “Any prelimi-
nary models I’ve seen look
very convenient, especially
the debit card system. It’s a
wonderful beginning to
preparing Pitt for the future.”

Many other schools have

- already taken the step into

the future and are currently

using ID’s similar to the one

being proposed here at Pitt.
Design team members

‘ attended an ID conference

run by Florida State
University, one of the fore-
runners in campus ID tech-
nology, and visited Indiana
University of Pennsylvania
to view its new ID system.
The current ID is produced
from a paper application
form and a photograph, heat-
sealing them together in

a plastic. The protective lami-

nation sometimes interferes
with the scanner, and it also
easily loses adhesion to the
card. '

The design team also said
the current machine used to
print the cards is obsolete,
and as of June 30, the current
vendor will no longer extend
the service contract on it.

“The new ID’s will even
have a different feel and will
look more like a credit card,
with a smooth surface. It will
scan more efficiently and be
more convenient,” said
DeSantis. ,

Pitt sophomore Chetali

Deport the obscene

An Islamic group in Pakistan has demanded the extradition
of Michael Jackson and Madonna to stand trial for spreading
obscenity, and asked for writers Salman Rushdie and Tasleema
Nasrin for blasphemy, according to Reuters Wire Service, in
response to the extradition of someone who may have been
involved in a bomb plot against the United States.

While coddling terrorists is not usually a good idea, if
Reagan can sell guns to one of the biggest sponsors of terror-
ism, then there is no reason the United States should not take
this opportunity to do a little house cleaning. The Pitt News,
however, favors freedom of the press, so it cannot in good con-
science recommend the extradition of the authors named
above. There are some figures in our society, however, who
have very little worth. It would probably profit the country in
terms of international relations and domestic policy to give the
following four people over instead of those named above.

The first to go should be John Wayne Bobbitt. He’s the only
man who became a greater man by becoming less of a man. He
has been arrested for allegedly attacking a second girlfriend
and obviously did not learn his lesson the first time. Beating up
women is bad, and for being obscenely stupid, John Wayne
Bobbitt should go.

Since she would probably hit it off with Bobbitt,‘ Tanya
Harding can be sent along to keep him company. Since she can
no longer figure skate, and the jury is still out on whether or
not that counts as a substantial contribution to society, she can
go. She was involved in professional wrestling promotions.
Unlike Frank Deford, who said: “I believe professional
wrestling is real, and everything else in the world is fixed,” the
rest of us do not. Like Bobbitt, being obscenely stupid is her
crime.

For ruining the Motown experience, Michael Bolton and his
Xerox machine can go. No one can listen to the classic
Motown music anymore without thinking of this 40-something
white guy who thinks recycling ought to apply to music. What
he’s done to some classic music is blasphemous.

Finally, Rosanne can go. The show is not funny, no one cares
about her marrying her bodyguard, and if America knows what
is good for it, it will prevent Rosanne from breeding. Maybe

this should be part of the Republican Contract with America:’

the Rosanne Non—Breeding Act. Perhaps they'll accept that as a
new part of the contract in exchange for leaving funds intact
for police officers. The fact that she needed artificial insemina-
tion shows that this is someone who was not naturally selected.

In an effort to promote cross-cultural understanding and to

remove a bit of the dead weight from our own, The Pitt News ‘

recommends that these people be extradited. Not only will this
promote good will, but it will also give this country a chance to
see how a totalitarian, repressive regime handles dealing with
threats to society. It may provide an illuminating suggestion or
two as to how to deal with crime with a lack of police officers.

hook viciously
for 20 seconds
_‘and all but ﬂat-
 . . tened Kobe,
Columnist Japan. What
Tony» had once been a
Dickensheets modern, post-
industrial city
was reduced to rubble. The city
looked more like that of the
Third World or a war zone
instead of one of Japan’s most
metropolitan cities. By the time
the numbers were finally tallied
up over 5,000 people were
dead, thousands were injured
and hundreds of thousands
more were left homeless.
This was the largest earth-
quake in Japan since the 1923

Great Kanto Earthquake and

will likely cost upwards of
$100 billion. The Kobe port,
which is the second largest in
Japan, was almost completely
destroyed. But this column isn’t
about the destruction of the
earthquake, for that has been
detailed more than enough.
This column is about the tri-
umph of Japanese society in the
face of death and the re-emer-
gence of the human spirit.

If it is possible for there to be
a silver lining that can come out
of this disaster, it is that those
who watched the coverage of it
had the rare opportunity to
learn much about Japanese
society, culture and government
without actually being there. I
lived in Japan for part of 1990,
and during that time I came to
greatly admire the Japanese and
their culture. But that was at a
time when the economy was
still booming, and their reces-
sion had not yet taken hold in
the conscience of the country.
And, of course, there had been
no disasters while I was there.
So I was heartened to see how
the Japanese responded when
everything was so suddenly
taken away from the citizensof
Kobe. Anyone who has had the

opportunity to experience
Japanese society firsthand was
not disappointed."

One of the first things that
one could learn from this disas-
ter is how stable Japanese soci-
ety is. Law and order in Japan
is a national ﬁxation that even
the opening up of the earth
couldn’t shatter. Despite lack-
ing food, water, toilet paper,
electricity and other daily
necessities, the Japanese

remained polite to one another. ‘

When some relief supplies
finally did arrive,. people
patiently stood in line waiting
for their turn. There was no
need for store or home owners
to grab their weapons to guard
against looting, because that
type of behavior is not a prob-
lem in Japan. Neighbors were
helping neighbors, not stealing
from one another.

The earthquake also dis-
played a government that is
clearly not prepared to handle

‘national emergencies. Since the

LDP lost sole power in the gov-
ernment in 1993, there has been
talk of a sort of political revolu-
tion._ Social and political
change comes very slow in
Japan, but if there is an event
that has the potential to be a
catalyst for change it was this
earthquake.

To say that the Japanese gov-

ernment was incompetent in _

handling this emergency would
be a compliment that it clearly
doesn’t deserve. It was disgust-
ingly slow in accepting foreign
aid, while at the same time not
providing the people with the
basic necessities of life. The
Japanese Mafia (yakuza)
stepped in to help before the
government did. After a couple
of days, even the patient
Japanese were criticizing the
lack of response by the govem-
ment. When all is said and
done, I believe that this earth-
quake may well have shaken

more than the city of Kobe — 7

it’s possible that the rumblings
of the Japanese citizens will be

quake reveals Japanese culture

felt in the political capital of
Tokyo as well.

With the Buddhist prayer
sticks still burning signifying
the grief over the loss of loved
ones, many mothers were visi-
bly worried about their children
missing too much school. Even
today the main role of Japanese
women is to look after the edu-
cation of their children. In

Japan they are known as kyoiku -  ««

mamas (education mothers),
and much of their lives are
judged by the success or failure
of their children in the competi-
tive education system. It is not
an exaggeration to say that the

Japanese are obsessed with ‘

education. One week after the
quake, some schools in Kobe
were already open and back to
educating the next generation
of Japanese citizens. There are
schools, however, that are still
too damaged to open, and the

children who are students there .

are being sent to live with fami-
lies in other cities so that they
will not fall too far behind in
their studies. The value of edu-
cation in Japanese society is so
strong and is seen as the major
reason for Japan’s economic

‘success that it is inconceivable

to Japanese mothers for their
children to miss even one week
of school.

This devotion‘ to education,
and to the goals of the nation as
a whole and not just a few
interest groups, will ensure that
Japan has a bright and success-
ful future ahead of it as the
world prepares to enter the 21st
century. In 1990 I had the
opportunity to visit Kobe, and I
marveled over its beauty as I
stood on a small hill overlook-
ing the port. In a few years I
look forward to returning to
Kobe and once again marveling
at its beauty and modernity.
Anyone who understands
Japanese culture would expect
nothing less.

Fondrk essence of

sports and the

spirit of competition in all of us.

For four years I have partici-
pated in IM basketball, both as
a referee and a player.

While the system does have
its good points, it has one bad
point that takes away from the
game.

The officiating stinks.

Sure everyone blows a call
from time to time and we are all
subjected to an occasional blun-
der or misinterpreted rule.

But there is no excuse for
incompetence.

Case in point is an ugly
sequence: of events"that~‘
occurred last week in a game
that I was involved in.

With 10 seconds left in a tied
game, I pulled‘ down an offen-
sive rebound. Five seconds
later, I nearly had my head
ripped off by an opposing play-
er. It was a clear ﬂagrant foul,
so clear that the other ofﬁcials
on the next court, who had hap-
pened to see the play, were
crossing their hands giving the
signal.

A ﬂagrant would have given
us two shots and, more impor-
tantly, the ball. ‘

However, the two so-called
referees assigned to my game
saw it as just your ordinary foul,
despite the fact that I was nearly
decapitated.

It got worse when I went to
the line. After missing the first
free throw, a lane violation was
called against my team on the
ensuing free throw when it “
clearly wasn’t. If there was a
violation, it would have been on
the other team, who looked as if
they had jumped into the lane
early.

As my teammates exploded, a
technical was called with ﬁve
seconds left. ,

Two points and the ball pretty
much meant the game was over.
But believeme, I have seen’

much worse.

In the past two years, I have
seen ofﬁcials change calls
because they were intimidated
by football players.

t I have alsobeen involved in
games that looked more like
rugby than basketball.

With freshmen, the biggest adjust-
ment is mentally. The best trait
that this class has is that they are
tough mentally.”

The coaching staff knew what
they wanted and they went after it.
According to Begor, the staff was
looking for four things when
recruiting.

“We looked to improve the ath-

“We also wanted to bring in a

You_ can find ' Jeremy
McClean’s dorm room very sim-
ply — just follow the twang of
the country music blaring from
his stereo. Walk into the room
and it will be hard to miss the

boots, ﬂarmel shirts and cowboy
hats that lie around.

Call him a hick or a redneck,
but you can’t take away the fact
that McClean has become one of
the top divers in the Big East
Conference.

“Even though I came here to
the city, I haven’t lost my small-
town roots,” McClean said. “I
still wear my boots, hat and listen
to my country music.”

You can’t blame him for being
a product of his environment His
“roots” are about 40 miles north
of Pittsburgh in Fombell, Pa., an
area that probably has more cattle
than people.

But McClean managed to
make it out of his rural surround-
ings and become one of the top
divers in the area while he attend-
ed Riverside High School.

He was good enough to
become WPIAL champion and
ﬁnish fourth at the PIAA champi-

moment in his young diving

“Jen is a high ﬂyer,” Begor said.
“She is a very gifted athlete who
may have the least experience of
the class, but she is working on
that by playing on a junior team.
Our hope for her is that she will
be able to compete for a position
next year.”

The second signee is Tara
Haefner, a 5-7 setter from
Rochester, N.Y.

“Tara has spirit,” Begor said.
“She has a lot of personality, she
is aggressive and is very comfort-
able with being in charge. She

will be standout student and mid-

“Jessica is a relentless competi-
tor,” Begor said. “She is as good
an all-around player as any Pitt
has ever had coming in here.”

The fourth and ﬁnal signee for
Pitt is 5-11 outside hitter Anne
Marie Tarara, hailing from

Najuma Fletcher will be taking
her show nationally, as she quali-

_ﬁed for the NCAAs in three dif-

ferent categories to lead the men’s
and women’s track team “last
weekend at the Husker
Invitational in Nebraska.

“Most ninners, if lucky, will get
to the nationals once out of the
four years they run,” coach Steve
Lewis said.

Fletcher, a third-year, all-pur-
pose athlete dropped the bomb on
some _of the nation’s elite teams
with top six finishes in the three
events that she competed in. She
took first place in the long jump
with a 20’8 1/2 jump. In the high
jump‘ she ﬁnished in sixth place
(5’7 3/4), and she landed a third
place ﬁnish in the the triple jump
(42’5 1/4), her career best in that
event, to finish the triple crown
and qualify for the national cham-
pionships in tluee different events.

“Our goal is to get as many
people qualiﬁed [for the nationals]
as possible,”'Lewis said.

major is political science.

There is only one glaring
omission -from her list of hon-
ors and awards — a national
championship.

“Obviously, we want to go
as far as we can, and we’d
love to win the national cham-
pionship, but if a better team
beats us,_ it won’t necessarily
be a disappointing season,”
she said. Then she adds, “Of
course my goal, as senior, I
want to win the whole thing.”

Lobo, an All—American last

team’s chances, but realizes
the. team must work hard to
regain its form from last year
rather than waiting for it to
happen.

“We have to work hard on
being consistent because right
now, we are expecting every-
thing to be the way it was

,. when we ended last March,”

she explained. “We have three
new freshmen on the court,
but the faces on the court are
basically the same. We have to
be more patient and work
hard. Nothing is going to be

For UConn to improve upon

and she feels more focused as

nn into Field House

For the first time in her col-
legiate career, she did not play
for USA Basketball over the
summer. Instead, she worked
only on her individual game,
and as the summer wore on,
her thirst for competitive bas-
ketball grew.

“I think it was good because
when I came back, I was real-
ly ready to play,” she said.
“This summer, I did the most
I’ve ever done in terms of get-
ting in shape, like running and

’ lifting. I think it was good,

because in the past, when I
played all summer, it was just
like a continuation. But in my
outlook this year, I’m a lot
more focused and excited just
to be on the court again.”

This should not be a com-
forting thought to opponents,
as she averaged 19.2 points,
11.2 rebounds and four blocks
per game last season.

In this year’s media guide,
each player gives a quote that
inspires them. Lobo’s quote is

“All I want from tomorrow is

to be better than today.”
Following. her own advice,
each year her statistics have
risen in all categories, and if
that trend continues, she will
most likely graduate with her
name atop the UConn basket-
ball record book.

But that is not her first pri-
ority. She just wants to win
games.

higher expectations,” Lobo
said. “Everyone expects us to
do better, but we expect that
from ourselves. It’s fun being
the underdog, and we’re
going to miss that, but we can
still keep that kind of mentali-
ty, because we have to go out
there and prove ourselves.”

To Lobo, it probably seems
like an eternity since the first

for me in two years. I wondered
what he could do for me in four,”
McClean said. T

So McClean passed up
Clemson, Georgia and a number
of other schools to stay close to
home and attend Pitt.

He wasted no time proving that
he could handle collegiate com-
petition. A

At the 1993 Big East
Championships he shocked
everyone, including himself, with

g a ﬁfth place finish in the l-meter.

“That was one of my best per-
formances ever,” he said. “My
average score for 11 dives was
around 480; I hit 510. The guys
who placed ahead o£..me were the
top four divers in the country.

“The fourth place guy was an
All—American, and he only beat
me by one point. After that, I
knew what I was capable of.”

With a year of experience
under his belt, McClean headed
into the 1994 championships with
a berth to the NCAA champi-
onship in his mind.

He placed fourth in the 1-
meter, fifth in the 3—meter and
third in the platform.

“I was really disappointed in
myse ,” he said. “I didn’t dive as
well as I could have.”

McClean had a chance to

y redeem himself at the NCAA

qualiﬁers.

But disaster struck and he
never got past warm—ups. While
attempting a reverse two and one
half tuck, he hit the board and
broke his ﬁnger.

rapidly approaching, McClean is
ready to make up for lost time.

“He has made the most
improvement this year,” Krug
said. “He is coming on very
well.”

Led by McClean’s domination
in the dual meets, the men’s swim
team has stormed out to a 9-3
record.

But McClean can’t help but
look a little past the regular sea-
son.

“College divers look at dual
meets for the team,” he said. “The
Big Easts and NCAAs are for
ourselves.”

Krug feels that how far
McClean can go will depend on
how well he controls his competi-
tive nature.

“His limitations are not physi-
cal,” Krug said. “His key is that
he must get emotional control.
He’s extremely motivated to suc-
ceed.’-’

McClean’s burning desire to
succeed is clearly positive, but
sometimes it can makes things
diﬁicult, especially for Krug.

“He can be tough to coach at
times,” Krug said. “I’ve had to‘
kick him out of practice. If he
doesn't get something right, he
can get negative and irate. He’s a
bit of a hot head and very intense.
But he’s learning to control his
emotions, and the results are
showing. I haven’t had to kick
him out of practice in a long
time.”

Coming into the Big East
Championships, the Pitt diving
team will be looking to unseat its
old nemesis Miami. The

of the top teams in the nation and
will be the favorites when the
championships begin on Feb. 23
at Pitt.

“I feel much better this year
coming into the Big Easts,”
McClean said. “It is going to be
kind of like pre-nationals for me.

Miami has the top divers in the »

nation. My goal is break up the
their domination of the top
spots.”

After that, McClean will face
his ﬁnal hurdle for the 1995 sea-
Son, the NCAA qualiﬁers.

“He is poised to make that leap.
I think that he can not only make
it, but score,” Krug said. “That’,s
saying a lot as to how far he has

her season best, and she also quali-
fied for the nationals in the
process.

“To make it to the finals is a
major achievement,” Lewis said.

Although everyone on the team
did not qualify for nationals, the
Panthers still had a good showing
against their stiffest competition of
the season.

“That meet gave the kids a
chance to get a look at the compe-
tition and see what they’ll be up
against in the conference ﬁnals.
That was the biggest indoor meet
on the collegiate level,” Lewis
said.

That competition included over

90 national qualiﬁers and some of
the largest schools in the nation.
The competition also had a
chance to look at third-year sprint-
er Jay Murphy's back, as he posted
his best time of the season (7.54),
ﬁnishing in third place in the .

And in the tag team portion of
the meet, Tonya Mullins, Ayne
Allen, Joetta Purter and Lakeya
Smith earned a ﬁfth—place ﬁnish
(3:48.69) in the 4x400 relay.

The men’s tag team of Jay
Jones, Curtis Anderson, Jerel
Williams and Dietrich Jells also
earned a ﬁfth-place ﬁnish in the
4x400 relay (3:l7.64) to finish out
the Panthers’ strong showing at the
meet. ’

pus. The program has grown
by leaps and bounds since her
freshman year, when only
1,606 season tickets were
sold. This season 6,541 season
tickets sold out almost a
month before the Huskies’
first game.

Lobo has been through it all.
She loves the fact that season
tickets are sold out, but said
there is also a downside.

“It’s great that the support is
where it is,” she said. “I just
hope that all the students who
want to come to the games
will still have a chance to,
because they’re still our

‘favorite fans. They’re the ones
who really get into the game
the most.”

That is the kind of thing that
has led Auriemma to say he

' will miss her more as a person

than as a player.

When Lobo graduates in
May, she has hopes of going
overseas to play professional-
ly.

Luckily for UConn fans, and

season to watch a classy ath-
lete doing the thing she loves
most.

It was even worse when I was
an official. At times, I would be
paired with others who would
blow the whistle maybe once or
twice a game whenever they felt
like it It put a ton of pressure on-
me to make every call, which is
seemingly impossible.

In defense of the IM referees,
there are a number of them who
are excellent. They know the
rules, make a quick call and
stick by it. I

It is the ones who don’t fol-
low these simple rules that

make playing IM dangerous.

But where do these refs come

from?

It is known by most involved
with IM that, good or bad, these
ofﬁcials come from a university
class.

The course is run by Al
Liberi.

Liberi runs an excellent class
and is a well-respected individ-
ual who knows the game up and
down.

However, the deﬁciencies in
the system must be worked out.
Maybe three officials should be
at every game instead of the two
that usually work them.

There should also be some
sort of system to make sure that
refs show up to their assigned
games. I have seen way too
