WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 1990

At last evening’s presidential debate, Student Government Board
presidential candidates Michael Cohen and Brent Saunders took
their last opportunity to inﬂuence voters before today’s election.

“I immediately pledge to be responsible, diverse and energetic.
As a candidate for president, it is essential to realize that SGB must
be fully representative of and accountable to
you, the constituency it represents, we the
students. I feel this slogan, representative of
and accountable to you, is the fundamental I
purpose of the Student Government Board,
I propose adding some additional
committees depending on need to better help SGB serve our

Other problems which Saunders described as “still unsolved, but
not unsolvable” include trying to obtain more residence-hall
spaces, improving safety by getting better lighting and more shuttle
services, alleviating the horrors of off-campus housing, possibly
installing a crosswalk between Forbes Quadrangle and David
Lawrence Hall, foreign teaching assistants, computer availability, a
financial—aid board and possibly installing guard rails on the Fiftzi
Avenue side of the Cathedral of Learning to Bigelow Boulevar ;.

PAT fare increases result of higher fuel prices

By Aimee Wolﬁnger
Staﬂ‘ Writer

The Port Authority of Allegheny County
announced a proposal on Monday to
increase fare rates beginning on Jan. 1,
1991, because of the higher cost of diesel
fuel.

According to Debra DeCourcy, assistant
manager of ,media relations at PAT, the
fare increases being implemented in

January are the result of the debt PAT has A-

already incurred because of higher fuel
costs.

“This particular fare increase is proposed
solely on the reason that we are paying
higher fuel costs,” she said. “Normally, we
increase fares because of higher overall

operating expenses.”

Since the Persian Gulf crisis began this
summer, fuel costs have been escalating
rapidly. In August PAT was paying 61
cents per gallon for diesel fuel. When PAT
announced on Monday its proposal to
increase fares, it was paying over $1.09 a
gallon, said DeCourcy.

If diesel fuel remains at its current price,
PAT will have a $3.2 million deﬁcit, said
DeCourcy.

“We use 10 million gallons of diesel fuel
per year. When we determined our budget
for this fiscal year, we estimated fuel as
costing 72 cents a gallon,” she said. “That’s
the most we’ve ever paid for diesel fuel in
the history of PAT.”

Rate increases vary from 15 cents for a

Zone 1 cash fare to $13 for a Zone 5
monthly pass.

Under the proposed fare increases, the
cost for monthly passes would increase by
$5 for Zone 1, $6 for Zone 2, $7 for Zone
3, $8 for Zone 4 and $13 for Zone 5.

“This is the first time we have increased
the cost of our monthly pass since 1984,”
she said.

Pitt junior Christine Langsdale said that
the increase will not affect her ridership. “I
have to get a pass anyway. It’s still cheaper
than driving in to town and paying for
parking,” she said.

“I have to ride anyway, but it’s going to
be a real strain on me. I can’t afford to put
$55 out at one time to buy a [Zone 5} pass,
so I buy weekly passes,” said junior Nancy

Greco.

Because of the difficulty finding parking
in Oakland, Greco will continue to use the
bus. “The bus is the lesser of two evils,”
she said.

Students said that they understand the
need for PAT to increase fares.

“I understand because of gas prices, but
I think that when gas prices go down,
fares should go down too,” said first—year
student Scott Brendlinger: ,

“I understand that fuel costs are going
up, and they need to raise prices,” said
Greco. “I don’t blame PAT. I blame the
fuel companies. They are the heart of the
problem. They see something going on in
a Third World country, and they take

Blacks must liberate themselves

By Mindy Boffemmyer
T be Pitt News

African Americans must
liberate themselves from mental
slavery, according to author and
psychologist Na’im Akbar, who
lectured last night as part of
Black Week 1990.

“The [slavery] process was one
that was necessary to convert
our thinking so that we would
want not for our own well-
being, but for the well-being of
our master,” he said.

Akbar’s lecture, titled “African-
American Education for Mental
Liberation” was held in the
William Pitt Union Assembly
Room at 8:30 p.m.

In his lecture, Akbar equated
the slavery mind set to insanity.

“When people are not
interested in preserving who they
are, we as psychologists and
psychiatrists and even the man
on the bus will tell you, ‘that

man is crazy,” he said.

“lThisl insanity has made us
believe that to be other than
ourselves is correct, and if we
see someone acting like
ourselves, then we become upset
and begin to attack them,” he
said.

“We believe that anybody who
stands out in an affirmative way
for us is suspect-. We’re the first
to label them as militant, the first
to label them radical, the first to
label them as too black. Our
worst enemies become
ourselves. That’s the slave mind,”
he said.

According to Akbar, census

‘figures are inaccurate.

“If they told the truth, [...l you
may not be as minority as they
would have you believe —— not
only here, but in Chicago, in
New York [City],” he said.

“Every large city in the country
seems to have more of us than
anybody else. Now if that's the

case, how then can we be so
powerless?” he asked.

“Because we are still operating
with minds of slaves. l...l How
then do we take back our minds?
How do we begin to restore our
minds to our control?” he asked.

Akbar said that in order to
overcome mental slavery,
African Americans must know
who they are and decide what
they want.

“European Americans l...l
came over to America, swearing
they discovered it, and said, ‘we
want to build this for our home.
[They] ignored the realities here
and proceeded to build it,” he
said.

“Now I’m not suggesting you
go around taking people’s
homes, discovering their houses,
and then killing them off when

they say, ‘get the hell out of my
house.’ But at least be willing to
‘decide What YOU Want and be Todd Ledbetter plays at the jazz presentation yesterday as part of
Black Week.

advantage of the consumer
because they know they can get
away with it.”

Sara Wright, a first-year student,
thinks the higher fares will affect
general ridership.

“A lot of people don’t have to
ride the bus; it’s just more
convenient,” she said. “People
are going to try to burn a ride.
Most people would rather be at
school two hours earlier than pay
more.”

For those who wish to publicly
express their opinions about the
proposed fare increases, a public
hearing will be held on Tuesday,
Nov. 27 at the David Lawrence
Convention Center.

“We encourage [student]
attendance of the hearing,” said
DeCourcy. “Students can find out
how fare increases will
individually affect them.”

£v_overnment Board. I would like
to establish a liaison system; a
direct pipeline between student
groups, no matter what size they
are, and the Student Government
Board so that concerns,
complaints and problems can be
directed. I would also like to

“-Expand the representative student
council  into a stronger student
voice,” Cohen said.

Cohen also will work to create
a security system known as crime
watch in Oakland, to reinstate
self—defense classes, to form a
security committee, and to publish
a “stay safe” guide.

._ Among his concerns are living
conditions for on- and off-campus
students. On campus, he will
work with the Resident Student
Association to improve on-
campus housing conditions. He
also said he will talk to landlords
about changing the lease dates
for students living off campus so
the leases will coincide with the

I school term.

Candidates also addressed
questions from a four—member
panel which included: Katie

Malaspina, current SGB member; V

Scot Ross, editor in chief of The
Pitt ‘News; Lisa Campoli, SGB
governmental-relations
chairperson and Melissa Smith,
co-president of the Bisexual, Gay

éind Lesbian Alliance.

-What makes you the stronger
candidate, and how will you
prevent a _ situation of
irresponsibility and
unaccountability, similar to what
happened this term, from
occurring?

“I feel I have the most concrete
and unique idea on this campaign,
which is the ’student—affairs

ztommittee,” Saunders said. “This

committee  will be a standing
committee of the board  it will

serve as a check on the Student A

Government Board back to the
students The gap of
communication [between
students and the SGB] has to be
improved,” Saunders continued.

Cohen said that he feels the
SGB can work without

Sr

establishing additional
committees. “The first thing I
would like to do is change  the
weekly meeting to a bi-weekly
meeting,” Cohen said. He also
will make the information
discussedat the meetings
available to all students by
distributing it by use of a billboard
system and relaying the
information to the representative
student council.

-What extraordinary powers
does the SGB president have?

“The president has the power
to act in several different ways.
First we act as mediators  The
president is the person elected
as a representative of the student
body to the administration  As
presidentl have the responsibility
to go to the administration and
work as hard as possible to
represent the concerns of
students,” Cohen said.

“The most extraordinary
power of the president lies in his
ability to appoint people to
positions  but the president is
limited by the students’ best
interests and must keep that in
mind. I plan to utilize the student-
affairs committee when making
these decisions. I want
nominations to be open to all
students. I will have an open-
door policy to all students, also
the bulletin/board idea is great
for this,” Saunders said.

-How can you reach out to
gay students?

“Discrimination in any form is
wrong, but the SGB is not a
programming body. It is there to
serve and assist student groups.
I will be very supportive in giving
you any assistance needed  to
help you program better,”
Saunders said.

“I’d would like to have a special
workshop at a retreat to let the
board and myself be better
informed about the issues dealing
with racism and sexism, and in
your particular case, anything
that occurs and is a problem for
bisexual, gay and lesbian students
 We must then work with your
group directly on this problem,"
Cohen said.

3What can be done to combat
apathy on the board?

“Unfortunately, once that
occurs, you can’t make the
situation any better, but you must
first express your criticism to that
board member, then if necessary,
I am not afraid by any means to

go to students, to go to 779e Pitt
News and criticize that member
who is not doing the job that they
are elected to do. If necessary I
will take action to have that board
member removed,” Cohen said.

“It comes down to leadership
skills. The president must work
with the board and make sure
the board members are happy in
what they are doing, and therefore
they will do their job and do it
right. A way “to alleviate this
problem is to have a bulletin
board. If we publish what is
being done weekly, I don’t think
it would come to this. To remove
a board member is atrocious,”
Saunders said.

-What unique qualities do you
possess which best exemplify a
Student Government Board
president?

“Being an understanding person
 but not always in a serious
fashion, it’s not always business
as usual. I want to make students
feel their concerns are being
listened to  I have always been
a concerned student like them,”
Cohen said.

“I feel I have discipline and
determination, as most of you
have seen through my numerous
leadership positions. I am a
competent and qualified
spokesperson for the students,”

Limits set onlelections spending

By Scot Ross
Editor in Chief

In this era of multimillion-
dollar, national—election
campaigns, Pitt’s Student
Government Board’s election
committee has limited candidates
to a flat rate of available campaign
expenditures.

Presidential candidates can
personally spend $200 on the
election, while board hopefuls
are given a $175 cap, according
to Theresa Wilson, elections-
committe chairperson. This
money can be spent on a number
of campaign items but cannot
come from individual donations
and mustbe accounted for before
and after the election.

Recognized student
organizations are allowed to
spend $25 each to support one

presidential and four board
candidates. This money must be
spent on the candidate’s behalf,
not a direct contribution. Wilson
said organization money cannot
come from funds allocated by
the SGB. Organizations usually
buy posters or advertisements
for the candidates, Wilson said.

Candidates are required to
submit forms before and after
the election, documenting
campaign costs as well as where

the money came from.
Organizations must also provide
campaign— expenditure

information upon request.

“From day one we’ve run the
election straight by the code,”
Wilson said. “Because we ran it
straight by the code, there haven’t
been any problems.”

Allocated funds for SGB to run
the campaign total $7,923, said

E---STUDENT

GVERNMENT

Wilson. The induction ceremony
costs $3,565, while approximately
$1,500 goes toward advertising
costs. The remainder pays for
election and poll—operator
salaries, and equipment costs.

To increase voter turnout,
Wilson said the election is being
run differently this year.

“lIt’sl sort of an experiment in
that it’s a one-day process, and
we’ve added several new polling
places,” Wilson said.

These include new locations at
Hillman Library, David Lawrence
Hall, Trees Hall, Pennsylvania Hall
and Scaife Hall.

. Other locations include the
William Pitt Union, Victoria
Building, Benedum Hall, Clapp
Hall and Lothrop Hall. The polls
will be open Wednesday, Nov. 7

Port amt/oority needs /92'/ee. ..

The city of Pittsburgh will soon feel yet another side
effect of the Persian Gulf crisis.

The Allegheny County Port Authority Transit has
proposed fare hikes for commuters. This will mean that
fares for bus rides will increase to $1.25. Prices for
monthly bus passes will also rise for all zones. Rates for
monthly passes in Zone 1 will increase by $5, while Zone
5 riders will have to pay an extra $13.

As much of an inconvenience as this will be for
Pittsburgh commuters, the fare hike is desperately needed.
Diesel fuel prices for PAT have increased by 56. percent
s‘iriC“é ’t‘li“€.L‘(”:ri‘$i's‘ began‘.‘jWhen the fares for‘the new fiscal

’y‘é‘5} ivéié ‘oh ihally %lCét%‘r‘r‘1’ii‘n‘E‘<‘.l', ‘PAT was pt‘e‘di'c't'ing that

it would be paying 72 cents per gallon, already the highest ,

amount in its history.

Monthly fares for PAT have not gone up since 1984. But
becauseof the crisis, budgets have to be adjusted and
therefore the hikes are needed. .

PAT fares are not solely the fault of the transitcompany.
Many oil companies have used this crisis as an excuse for
raising prices. Even before the crisis began, major oil
companies raised the price of oil for questionable reasons.
A good example of this wouldbe the price hike after the
Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1988.

At the moment, there has not been any fighting in the
Persian Gulf region. Once fighting does break out,
however, oil prices, which are already at record levels,
will skyrocket.

Prices for oil are currently running at approximately $37
per barrel, an increase of 231 percent over prices before
Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait. Should fighting erupt in Saudi
Arabia, oil prices will easily break the $40 barrier and
probably go much higher. ‘

This fare hike will also affect Pitt students. Many
studentshave to take the bus into campus to get to classes.
Unfortunately”, this will be just another financial problem
that Pitt students will have to face because PAT needs
these rate increases.

The average driver is not alone in the fight to keep up
with rising gasoline prices; PAT has to deal with them as
well. By raising prices to deal with the situation, PAT is still
encouraging people to ride. People riding PAT during this
crisis will not have to pay as much as those who have to
fill up their gas tanks every day.

Even though there is a chance that the Persian Gulf crisis
will be resolved peacefully, it does not mean that oil and

I gasoline prices will come down. Therefore, commuters

will just have to add more to the cost of their daily
commutes.

A tribute to Rabbi Meir Kahane

because of them. But this did not *’"‘

The Arab—lsraeli conﬂict has
finally been put in perspective
for me. Needless to say, it took an
act of violence for this to happen.

On Monday night after a rough
night of work to get this
newspaper into production, ‘fl
went back to my apartment to
relax. Occasions like this don’t
happen very often, so I wanted to
get away from reality for a while.
I wanted to avoid tension and my
pessimistic views on current
issues. Unfortunately, I also have
this bad habit of turning on the
news every time I’m in my
apartment.

After seeing a story on the
Persian Gulf crisis, the
anchorperson said that Rabbi Meir
Kahane, a radical anti—Arab, had
been shot and killed outside a
New York City hotel. I

Kahane was, in short, a fanatic.
Mind you, he was a respectable
fanatic but a fanatic nonetheless.
He honestly believed that all Arabs
should die because they were,
according to him, irrational and
incapable of attaining, peace.
Because of these views, not only
did Arabs despise him, but many
Jews disliked him as well. They
felt that his views would damage
chances for a prospective
agreement on a homeland for the
Palestinians.

He led a very active life. He had
been a member of the Israeli
parliament for many years and
had even attempted to gain
leadership of Israel. He started
militant Jewish groups with the
sole purpose of defending
themselves against the Arabs.
Kahane also took steps to arm
Jews in this country in an attempt
to defcndjews from anti-Semites.

I had the chance to meet
Kahane during a speech he gave.
Last year he visited Pitt to express
his views on the Palestinian
situation. As a staff writer for this

paper, Ijumped at the chance to
cover his speech —— hey, any “nut
case” would make a great
headline, I thought.

I was completely overwhelmed
by Kahane’s hatred toward the

;, Arab ‘people. I couldn’t believe

that any person could be so

 

Jeff
Tatusko

committed to the Zionist cause
and so committed to the genocide
of an entire religion.

Before the rally, local Arab and
Jewish groups protested Kahane’s
presence, saying that he was a
warmonger and that he should
not be allowed to speak his views.
They believe in a peaceful
solution for the region. He actually
dismissed them and even
condemned both sides, saying
that they couldn't grasp the reality
of the situation.

But the one thing that struck
me about Kahane was his ability
to fend off attacks against his
views and actually use those
attacks for his own defense. He
would let a person speak his
mind and then, once finished
would take apart the criticisms
bit by bit, not allowing the critic
to respond to his rebuttal.
Kahane realized that his views
were radical. He also predicted
that he would be assassinated

stop him from expressing them,
and he kept expressing them
until two bullets ended his life
Monday night. ,
Whether or not his assailant

.. was. an Arab is still a mystery,

although many people highly
suspect that he was. But Kahane
did not just have Arab enemies. 2
He had the tendency to outrage
people, all people, and therefore,
the assassin could have just as

‘ well been Jewish.

Right now Israel is in a
permanent state of uproar. Last
month Israeli police shot and
killed 21 Palestinian rioters who
were attacking Jewish
worshippers. Soon after, three
Jews were killed by a Palestinian
wielding a 16-inch knife. Now
somebody has assassinated Rabbi
Meir Kahane.

This latest act does not surprise
me at all. When I went to that
speech, I privately predicted that
somebody would kill him for his
views. I didn't believe that Kahane
was right then, and I still don’t
believe in his views; all Arabs are
not bad and should not be
stereotyped as such.

But this viole nce does one thing
for me: it makes me realize that
there probably will never be a
solution to the Israeli problem.
Both sides will be so busy
retaliating against each other that
it will soon become impossible
to even negotiate.

One of these days, another war
will break out between the Jews
and the Arabs (the situation in
the Persian Gulf could easily turn
into that type of conﬂict). And
these types of conﬂicts will
probably exist until one side is
completely overwhelmed by the
other.

Women are in men’s locker rooms; the Steelers
are on a roll, and the Penguins are actually playing
well without Mario Lemieux. There are lots of
things to talk about, so you all know what time it
is — it’s column time! So here are some notes from
the sportswriter with too much time on his hands.

-Everybody else has voiced an opinion on
women entering locker rooms after sporting events,

but neither does anybody else. Athletes should be

privacy.

-Speaking of thatwomen’s team, the Pittwomen’s
volleyball team goes to Penn State this weekend.
The Lady Panthers are facing one of the best teams
in the country, and junior Bridget Gary and freshman
Ann Marie Lucanie are both questionable because
of injuries, but they also might have a problem
adjusting to the large crowd. The team is finishing
its longest and last homestand of the season, and
attendance left something to be desired. Penn
State’s home matches usually draw large crowds.

Then again, what else is there to do in State

Wow! There are more budding
young stars on the San Antonio
Spurs than on the cast of “Twin

David Robinson (24.3 points per

them a serious threat to win the
championship. Veteran

rookie center Dwayne Schintzius

The Dallas Mavericks — now
there is a smart team. After being

disappointed with last year’s first-
round pick, Randy White, the
Mavs traded their abundance of
first—round selections for proven
talent. And proven talent is exactly
what they got in All-Star guard
Fat Lever (18.3 ppg, 9.3 rpg, 6.5
assists per game) and versatile
forward Rodney McCray (16.6
ppg, 8.2 rpg). Forward Alex
English was signed as a free agent.

This group of players should more

than make up for the departed
Sam Perkins.

Rolando Blackman (19.4 ppg),
Derek Harper (18.0 ppg, 7.4 apg)
and Lever give the Mavs a guard
rotation that rivals the Detroit
Pistons. If C James Donaldson
(9.1 ppg, 13.1 rpg) can stay healthy
and F Roy Tarpley (16.8 ppg, 15.1
rpg) can stay out of trouble, Dallas
could go far in the playoffs.

No horsing around...

By Spencer Borisoff

A new equestrian club, consisting of 78
members who range from completely
inexperienced riders to seasoned veterans
of the horse~riding circuit, has galloped
into action this semester.

“We became an official organization at
the University of Pittsburgh on May 1,
1990, and our first horse show was on Oct.
14,” said Laurie Scherr, the captain and co-
organizer of the horseback club.

According to Scherr, the club formed at
Pitt largely because of the need for more
teams in one of the competing regions that
make up the equestrian circuit.

“I was riding with the captain of the
University of Pennsylvania’s team, and
she asked if I was interested in forming a
team at Pitt,” Scherr said. “When one of

the 15 competing regions split, it created Scherr said.

The club has competed in two shows petitions for the end of next semester and

to establish its
presence as a club

In its first com-
petition at Keystone
Junior College, the
equestrian club
placed fifth overall
out of nine com-
peting schools and
took seventh in its
next showing at
Seton Hill.

Dickinson College,
Indiana University

and Penn State.
There are 12
events in a com-
petition, and each
event is divided
into sections similar
to heats. According
to Scherr, there are
five levels at which

“As of now, we’ve been incredibly riders compete, ranging from beginner
successful; we’ve gotten all of the other Walk trot to open equitation, where the
universities in the show circuit scared,” most experienced riders take part.

“It’s really neat that we get to go to
shows and compete against other schools,”
club member Courtney Evans said.

In an effort to prepare for upcoming ~

shows, the club holds a team practice
once a week, but according to Scherr,
some members like to get more work in by
riding on their own time as well.

Scherr said that the team has access to
about 20 horses, and practices are held at
two different stables. The beginners, who
have had one semester of instruction, ride
at Fox Hills, and the advanced riders,‘
consisting of those equestrians who can
jump fences, practice at Steven Fords
Stable, about 30 miles north of Pittsburgh.

Pitt is hoping to host a competition ofits
own at Steven Fords sometime toward the
end of the semester.

“Right now, Pitt is trying to make up for
a lot of lost time,” Scherr said.

Continued from page 7
Utah Jazz Coach Jerry Sloan must feel like he is a guest on MTV

because he is on the “hot seat” after his team has been bounced from

the playoffs in the first round for two consecutive years. Thejazz feels .

it has acquired the perimeter scorer it needed in guard Jeff Malone
(24.3 ppg), but he only converted one of six three-point attempts in
75 games last year with Washington.

Forward Karl Malone (31.0 ppg, 11.1 rpg, 56.2 FG percentage) and
guardJohn Stockton (17.2 ppg, 14.5 apg, 2.7 steals per game) are the
NBA’s top dynamic duo. Throw in F T hurl Bailey (14.2 ppg) and C
Mark Eaton (2.5 bpg), and the Jazz has as good a starting ﬁve as
anyone in the league, but where is the bench?

An MVP year by Houston Rocket Akeem Olajuwon (24.3 ppg,
14.0 rpg, 4.6 bpg, 2.1 spg) may be the only thing that can save Coach
Don Chaney’s job. Guard Kenny Smith was obtained to play the point
and has had a great preseason. This means that resigned Eric “Sleepy”
Floyd (12.2 ppg, 7.3 apg) will come off the bench as a scorer and
playmaker.

New coach Paul Westhead’s Denver Nuggets will be setting all
kinds of scoring records in 1990-91. While they should set the mark
for average points scored a game, their helter-skelter offense will also
establish the mark for points surrendered during a game. Some team
is likely to score over 200 points against the Nuggets. Guards Chris
Jackson and Todd Lichti, forwards Orlando Woolridge and Jerome
Lane and center Blair Rasmussen make up what could be the worst
defensive team ever.

The Minnesota Timberwolves should stay out of the Midwest
cellar because of their defense. Now, whether they actually play good
defense or just hold the ball as long as possible is debatable.
Swingman Tony Campbell (23.2 ppg) gives the Wolves a scorer.
Pooh Richardson (11.4 ppg, 6.8 apg) has shown some ﬂashes at point
guard. Rookie Gerald Glass should fit into the guard rotation quite
nicely. Minnesota also selected the most promising center in this
year’s draft in Louisville’sFelton Spencer.

Coach Matt Goukas must come up with a way to improve the
Orlando Magic defensively. Maybe instead of heading down the
ﬂoor in an attempt to get out on the break, the Magic should
concentrate on getting the rebound first. Forward Terry Catledge
(19.4 ppg, 7.6 rpg) comes to play every night. Nick Anderson (11.5
ppg) has the ability to be explosive at small forward. -Former Georgia
Tech guard Dennis Scott is going to have to learn how to create his
own shots in the NBA.

a season that may turn out to
be a great one. Maybe we
should give up on the team
before the season starts next
year, since this team seems to
be unable to play well until
everyone starts giving up on it.

-One key reason for the
Steelers’ success is the
contributions of rookies.
Defensive end Kenny
Davidson gave the pass rush a
lift earlier this season.

More recently, Craig Veasey
(another one of those guys
who Chuck Noll said signed
too late to be able to help the
team this season) has stepped
in and played well on the
defensive line while Lorenzo
Freeman and Aaron Jones are
on injured reserve and Keith
Willis has been nicked up. Last
week, with all~pro Tunch llkin
injured and T om Ricketts

struggling, Justin “Could I
Please BuyA Vowel” Strezlcyzk
played right tackle in the
second half as the offense came
alive.

This is more impressive
because he was expected to
be a project because he played
tight end and defensive line in
college.

for a semester but sat out as :1
Prop. 48 casualty. He has since _
gone on to become an All—‘
American candidate for the
Monarchs and played on the U.S.
national team over the summer.

-About a week ago I heard Lee

Corso say on ESPN that Pitt
regretted ﬁring Mike Gottfried
because of the Panthers’
disappointing season this year,
adding that Gottfried was the fans’
favorite all along. Lee, get a clue.

-Poor Gale Catlett. The West

Virginia basketball coach is
hoppin’ mad because them bad
ol’ Maryland State Police arrested
him for refusing to sign a citation
for failing to wear his seat belt

“Just because you wear a badge

doesn’t mean you can act smart to
people,” said Catlett. “He was a
wise guy, and I didn’t like it.”

Hey, Gale, just because you

coach a college basketball team
doesn’t mean you can act like a
pinhead.
