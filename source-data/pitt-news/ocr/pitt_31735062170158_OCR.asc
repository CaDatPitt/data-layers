Senator Strom Thurmond of
South Carolina spoke to a filled
and hostile audience in the Stu-
dent Union Ballroom Thursday
evening. The audience repeatedly
voiced their disapproval of Sena-
tor Thurmond’s views on militar-
ism.

The Senator said the Anti-Bal-
listic Missile (ABM) System is
necessary despite the belief of
some that Russia does not want
a nuclear war. “We must plan for
a capability and not plan on inten-
tions. We cannot rely on what the
Soviets say.”

The South Carolina Republican
drew the most laughter and hoots
when he said in the question-an-
swer period, “I was in Vietnam
in the Fall of 1966, and I didn’t
see any obscenities when I was
there.” .

Before the ‘night was over, he
expressed views on welfare, ob-
scenity, ABM System, student un-
rest, and Chief Justice-elect War-
ren Berger. Senator Thurmond ad-
vocated a district system which
would give each state the same
amount of electoral votes to re-
place the current electoral sys-
tem. He said, “I feel this takes’ it
back to the grass roots and every
citizen in the country has the
same voting power.” Senator
Thurmond defended his position
by saying that wherever one lev-
el of government has retained too

l=~

much power, tyranny has resulted.

The audience wildy applauded
the Senator’s statement that re-
cent Supreme Court rulings have
“held that nothing almost is ob-
scene." He continued, explaining
that this is not what the “whole-
some people” want and drew sca_t-
tered applause.

The question-answer period was

noisy. A group of about 35 black

students tried to attract the Sen-
ator’s attention repeatedly by
yelling “over here.” When he call-
ed on the group in the back, some-
one shouted “which one?” Another
black student yelled “we all look
alike” causing much laughter in
the Ballroom.

At times people in the audience
became violent in their attacks.
One Pitt student discussed the
atrocities in Vietnam and the
cities in the‘ United States and
said, “It’s people like yourself,
LBJ, and Dean Rusk that are
causing these, atrocitiesx” An-
swering why we had to be in Viet-
nam, Senator Thurmond said the

‘goal of the Communist is “to take

over the world.”

Cathedral Lawn Scene

Of Peace, Racism Rally

by ANN DORN
‘Staff News Writer

While Dr. James Holland, Uni-
versity psychology professor, was
being arrested downtown at the
Duquesne Club (see story, this
page) his wife was taking his}, place
in opening the. Friday afternoon
SDS (Students for a Democratic
Society) rally. .

About 300 people were gathered
on the Cathedral lawn to hear fea-
tured speaker Rennie Davis, co-
ordinator of the National Mobiliza-
tion Committee to End the War in
Vietnam.

DR. AUDREY HOLLAN,

speech professor, explained that
her husband, among other mem-
bers of the University commun-
ity, “went to have lunch and to
talk with the denizens of a well-
known Pittsburgh group” at the
Duquesne Club. She said that they
went to conduct a "teach-in”
about the exclusive club mem-
bers‘ role in the Vietnam war and
in “institutionalized racism."

Davis picked up the points of
war ‘and racism in his address.
“As more channels are closed."
he said. “the minorities look for
new channels. only to meet repres-
sion." Repression exists because
"President Nixon has decided that
the war must continue.“

He explained that the govern-

ment -nee'ds a “smokescreen“. to _

create a public issue to redirect
attention away the war. Young
people “who have questions about
the war,” blacks who are fighting
for their rights, and women who
are aiming for equality, he stated,
“are used a_s that smokescreen.”

Duquesne Club Rejects
10 University Visitors

by BOB BON N
Staff News Writer

Ten members of the University
Community — three of them fac-
ulty members — were ejected and
arrested by police on Friday for
reading a statement of opposition
to the Vietnam war in the Du-
quesne Club.

Noting that many of the mem-
bers of the club are top officials
of businesses such as U.S. Steel,
ALCOA, Gulf Oil, and North Amer-
ican Rockwell, which manufac-
ture materials for the war, the
group expressed the feeling that
these club members do notoffer
sons tmthe war, but contract to
make bombs, powder, jet fuel, and
missile components for the De-
fense Department.

The ten, who marched into the
club without warning, were soon
greeted by police called by por-
ters. They were arrested on
charges of disorderly conduct.

The group, an ad‘ hoc committee
of protesters, called themselves
the Citizens of Pittsburgh Against
War and Inequality. Each was fin-
ed $21.

The philosophy of the group’s
decision to protest in the Du-
quesne Club was based on the fact
that it "is indirectly supported by
the taxpayers, and "thus is not a
private club at all.

As members were filing in for
a luncheon, the group’s statement
went on to say “perhaps you re-

Three new members have been
added to the Board of Trustees.
Recently elected Alumni Trustees
were Robert G. MacDonald, John
M. Arthur,‘ and Arthur J. Brosius.

MacDonald, who graduated in
1931 in the School of Engineer-
ing, is the president of West Penn
Power Company and resides in
Greensburgh. He has been a reci-
pient of the Distinguished Engi-
neering Alumnus Award and an

"active member of the Annual Giv-

ing Fund.

A graduate from the Engineer-
ing School in 1944 and the re-
cipient of a Masters of Science in
1948,’ Arthur is the chairman of

the board and chief executive of- ‘

ficer, Duquesne Light Company,
who resides in Corapolis. He re-
ceived the Distinguished Busi-
ness Alumnus Award in 1968,
and has also been active in the An-
nual Giving Fund.

Both Arthur and MacDonald
were elected to three year terms.

Elected to a two year term,
Brosius graduated in 1935 from
the Business School and received
a Masters Degree in Literature
in 1940. He was a past president
of the Business Alumni Associa-
tion.

The. three new members were
selected by the vote of the Uni-
versity Alumni from a group of
four nominees. Paul N. Kuzmich,
an Engineering graduate in
1948 and vice-president of C-
lumbia Gas Company, failed to re-
ceive enough votes to fill one of
the positions.

MEANWHILE, “THE WAR is

intensifying at an enormous
pace,” even while the government
feeds the public “propaganda” on
"mutual withdrawal” and car-
ries on peace talks. “Every peace

fouled by a military escalation.

He said that the military em-
ploys three methods to win in Vi-

said Davis sarcastically, means
“if you can lock up all the ‘notor-
ious characters’ the struggle in
Vietnam will collapse.” He said,
seriously this time, that there are
plans to assasinate over 80,000
leaders of the Viet Cong. ’

Economist  
Discusses

Ghetto Lite 

by BILL GORMLEY
Staff News Writer

Professor Thomas Vietorisz of-.

the New School for Social Re-» 

search dissected the American
ghetto and focused on the ques-
tion of ghetto development Fri-
day afternoon in 144 CL. Dr. Vie-

torisz, who earned his Ph.D. in’ ’

Economics at MIT, discussed
“Project Selection

uate students.

Dr. Vietorisz shrank the egoes, "iii.

of the economists present‘ as he

emphasized “the primary role. of"  .
social, cultural, and political ef- - ’ '

fects in determining the value of
various ghetto development proj-

ects.” He relegated the econom- f "D 

ic consideration of resource allo-/
cation to a position
importance. »

The urban economist explained  '*_
that a marginally profitable indus-I as .. 
try which ‘enabled ghetto workers :
to acquire valuable skills was _

preferable to a more profitable
one which did not. Hestressed the

need for “an irrational allocation  
of resources in irrational socgi-’ « "

ties which permit ghettos to ex-
ist.” A - ‘

Dr. Vietorisz denied the conten- . ,
tion that ghetto development and .. J
eventual integration were mu- 
tually exclusive goals. He a'r-jp;

gued that ghetto development
would raise the standard of living

of slum dwellers and equip them.  _ "
with marketable skills, enabling‘  "

them to breakaway from the»
ghetto sometime in the future.

, Unfortunately, as Dr. Vietorisz

pointed out, investors shy away. W
from depressed areas. Business-, .

men usually "invest only if expect-

ed net returns are substantial and‘. — ’ I

ghetto projects are seldom very.
profitable. “If you are a-busines's-

/man,’_’ he confided, “the last place

you will want to go is the ghetto.”

He declared, however, that
economic development was “only
one method of improving ghetto
life,” and contended that “poor
neighborhoods need not be cultur-

al deserts as well.” He cited ,the I

civil rights‘ movement as a non-

economic morale booster which ‘

gave slum dwellers a sense of I
community and a measure of hope.

Recalling a year’s experience
in Harlem, Dr. Victorisz, des-
cribed briefly the squalid living‘-
conditions responsible for Har-1.
lem’s notoriety. He also sketched
the dimensions of Harlem’s un-V
employment problem, citing cen-
tral Harlem’s sub-employment
rate of 28.6 per cent.

Accordingvto Dr. Vietorisz, an i
expenditure of $300 million would
eradicate Harlem’s employment"
deficit.
would eliminate sub-employment,

nationwide. However, Dr. Vietorffgi, -

, Pittsburgh Joins “The Conspiracy

Mobilization Key °Point’

BETWEEN 2500 AND 3000 Pittsburgers

' and various out-of-staters converged on the

Point State Park Saturday for a “peace and

~ justice rally” sponsored by the Spring

Action Committee.

They were welcomed into Rennie Davis’
“conspiracy for the future” by
Monseigneur Charles Rice, co-chairman of
the Committee, along with Byrd Brown,

president of the Pittsburgh National
Association for the Advancement of
Colored People.

The marchers gathered at the Civic
Arena at noon before making their way
down to the Point. Colorful homemade
posters and banners marked the procession
as it wound its path by way of Sixth Ave.

and Liberty Ave., downtown. Leading the .

march were Monseigneur Rice, Byrd
Brown, Rennie Davis, coordinator of the
Mobilization to End the War, Donna Allen
of the National Committee to Abolish
HUAC/ HISC, and David Owens of Forever
Action Together (FAT).

THE PEACEFUL demonstrators walked
quickly while chanting phrases like “Join

' Us!” and “Peace Now!” The response of
« _. i the bystanders varied from curious stares

or disgusted looks, to enthusiastic peace
hand - signs waved at the marchers.

  
   

DONNA ALLEN criticized the “mass media
monopoly."

As the march drew closer to the Point, it
passed under an archway which produced
an echo, and one participant began to shout
“More Power to the People!” When the
others heard the resonant effect his voice
produced, they picked up the chant, and
soon the entire area sounded like a vast
echo chamber, throwing the enthusiastic
shouts back and forth.

The dream—like quality of the sound soon
dissipated when the march procession
came out of the dim archway into the bright
sunlight of Point Park. As the group
shuffled through the moist grass, each
person found his “spot” to settle and relax,
look for friends, eat a picnic lunch, or get a
tan until the rally began at 2 p.m.

THE FIRST SPEAKER was Dr. Ernest
J. Sternglass, professor of radiation physics
at the University. Dr. Sternglass warned
the assembly that “we may be the last
generation to witness the process of
evolution.” (See story, page 3.) He
explained that present nuclear fallout may
be the cause of a rise in infant mortality
and congential defects in parts of the
United States.

“Man has produced the most potent

biological weapon he has ever known,” he
asserted, “and he cannot survive a nuclear

 

  am. 3

' war.” He went on to say that if the present

nuclear system were employed, it would
end all human and other life, not
necessarily from immediate effects, but
from effects on the reproductive system.
“We would be saved only to see our
children die before the age of one.” Dr.
Sternglass urged that “we find a way to
eliminate nuclear testing and warfare, or
we may not live to see ourchildren and
grandchildren survive.”

The crowd next heard from Scott Baum,
Student Government president, who read
the “Citizens” statement presented to the
members of the Duquesne Club Friday.
(See story, page one and statement, page
three.) It was one of the more stirring
moments of the day as the participants
gave a standing ovation after the statement
was read.

NEXT TO SPEAK was Al Rojas from the
United Farm Workers. In an almost
screaming voice, he shouted, “Today we
march only -for peace in this country, but

I . also for the right wing so that they may

understand that we don’t believe in their

»  philosophy.”

Dave Owens also boomed his message to

 the audience. “The 1969 peace movement is

not the same as the movement of 1964.
Today, when you move against the peace

 movement,’ the peace movement will move
.—   against you.”

 BROWN, co-chairman of the Spring Ac-
, tion Committeeﬂdisplays a sign of determin-
ation.

    Young People Used

'   As , Smokescreen

(Continued from Page 1)

THE THIRD MEANS has B-52 planes
dropping bombs on hamlets, clearingthe
-rest of the village with bulldozers, evac-

» uating the “people who have survived so

far,” and finally sending them to concen-
tration camps.

He stated that these tactis will continue
as long as the young people are used as

I ...‘.‘smokescreens.” The “principle tool of

_repression” used to divert public atten-
tion from the war is a ru1e.that was intro-
duced by Senator Strom Thurmond in the
Civil Rights Act of 1968, said Davis. The
rule is the “anti-riot law, an essential tool
against the black movement.” The law

‘ would punish with up to five years in pris-
on anyone crossing state boundaries hav-
ing the “intent to create a civil disorder.”

With this law, Davis and seven others
are charged with “conspiracy” stemming
from their actions at the Chicago demon-
strations during the Democratic National
Convention last August. The trial is set for
Sept. 24. “In response to the phony cons-

5"  piracy charges, we call ourselves ‘The
  Conspiracy.’ If we stand against the im-
1, _, Apacted politics in America, we should all
if he conspirators,” cried Davis.

Also speaking at the rally were Cecil

  Birt of the Black Action Society, who sup-

ported the “Vietnamese people throwing
off their yoke of oppression.” ‘

Joseph White of the History Depart-

ment, defended the usefulness of demon-
strations, in which “we experience first-
hand that we are creators of vlitical op-
portunities. ”

He pointed out, however, that “we must

I:  be free to love one another and to build a

world we can pass on to our children. Our"
purpose is not to destroy each other.”

OWENS EMPHASIZED th at “we must
attack imperialism with marches, strikes,

- money, and hard labor.” He urged the rally

participants to “go home and organize 24
hours a day to reach the other 99 per cent of
society . . . we’ve identified the enemy—he
stands around us and destroys our minds,
but we will survive and we will win.”

After he spoke, the entire audience stood,
joined hands and sang “We Shall
Overcome.” They were led in song by an
improvised children’s choir. The children
were taken from the crowd and rehearsed
before the rally began by Sirjohn/from
Hillside House. Sirjohn told the adults in
the audience that “this is not our world
anymore, and we must heed the children.”

Donna Allen of the Women’s Strike for
Peace spoke next. She emphasized that she
wanted her remarks well—noted by the
press, for her topic was the “repression by
the mass media monopoly.” She claimed
that the “mass media monopoly” is
keeping America confused and immobilized
with misinformation.”

SIRJOHN REHEARSES the choir of yoo ngsters from the rally audience.

people.”

  

  

“IT IS THE MEDIA who have been
mainly keeping the war going, helping the
ghettos get worse and larger, and
encouraging some Americans _to. oppress.-
others. Thislis the enemy we should be
concentrating on.”

Miss Allen sees a problem in that the
“media believe they are fairly presenting
the news as they see it. . . . When they tell
Americans we are fighting in Vietnam to
defend the United States from
Communism, that is the way they see it.”
She pointed out that the FCC is specifically
“prohibited by law from interfering with
the content of any program on the air, and
reminded the audience of the basic right of
freedom ‘of speech, but “obviously
something much deeper is wrong here.

Obviously if press freedom in this country’?-.gi,.;

is defined simply as the absence of
government restraint, we need a new
definition, because in no other sense do we
have a free press in America.” »

Miss Allen sees the “breakdown in
democracy” due “not to the
demonstrations but to the monopoly control
of the channels of information and
communication in this country by the
minority, a few wealthy individuals who do
not want all the facts to be heard lest it
threaten the status quo.”

- view of the issue as ‘dissent.’ . . . The media

will backlash us as often as necessary to
keep us respectful of their power and
fearful of antagonizing them.— in other
words: repressed.”

“The revolts here at home,” reasoned
Miss Allen, “are not going to end until we
have regained a free press in this country,
defined as equal access to the mass media
for all Americans._”

Byrd Brown took the podium after Miss -

Allen and switched the topic of discussion

and the monies which may be spent on it.
He stated that there ‘have been no
indications that the ABM will work, or even
if it does, it will make no difference in the
ultimate results of a nuclear war. The
money, he said, could go to finance,
“hospitals, schools, homes” and other
domestic needs. “If anyone says that he’d
rather have that stupid system, he’s a
damned bigot and fool and ought to be run‘
out of the country.”

THE LAST FEATURED speaker was
Rennie Davis of the “Chicago Conspiracy”
(see story, page one). He publicly mused
over the irony that it is not a crime to cross
international boundary lines to make war,
but “it is a crime to cross state lines to pu
an end to that destruction.” '

“The real criminals,” he said, ‘‘aren’t‘’” a‘

under indictment.”

He called on the audience to “grasp the
lesson of Vietnam — the most sensual

I

lesson of the century . . . that peasants and, — ~.
working people can turn every act of '

repression into a workingof repression
into a working strength.”

“If it is now a conspiracy to be against
war, to be for the workers’ liberation and
for the black liberation, and to be against
the racist political institutions, then it is
our task to win millions to an open
conspiracy in America.”

Kevin Donovan, a memer of the Vets for
Peace, expressed the view of a minority of

ex-servicemen when he called the war in

Vietnam 3 “mass murder. _God doesn’t

“With Rally For “Peace andjustice

Pitt Prof Fears Radiation Results

“We are ‘On the Beach,”"lamented Pro-
fessor Ernest J. Sternglass, University
professor of radiation physics. “If there
were a full scale war, there would be few
children born who would live to the next
generation.”

Dr. Sternglass was one of the speakers
at the Point State Park rally Saturday. Be-
fore the rally, he spoke in detail to The Pitt
News about his paper which presents new
arguments againarguments against the ABM
missile), and gives new evidence of the ef-
fect of nuclear radiation.

THE UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR pre-

sented his findings at the May Hanford I

Symposium on “The Radiation Biology of
the Fetal and Juvenile Mammal" in Rich-
land, Wash. The implications for the ABM
will be discussed in June in the Bulletin of
the Atomic Scientists.”

Professor Sternglass stated that nu-
clear weapons, rather than being “large
explosive devices or fire—bombs accom-
panied by a flash of radiation . . . with rel-

_atively minor long-range radiation ef-

fects,” do in reality cause “unexpectedly
serious biological effects produced by low

“The human embryo is ten to 100 times
more. sensitive to radiation. This has been
confirmed on animal studies.” Dr. Stern-
glass cited Russian studies which showed
dogs, injected with radiation when fetuses,

. were less trainable and carried distur-

bances in their nervous systems.

EVIDENCE OF NUCLEAR effects have
already been seen in the United States (see

map). The effects are long-term because .

“the Strontium 90 lives for at least 30
years and gets in the food and water.” The
data that Dr. Sternglass uses in his paper
involve a year by year “detailed correla-
tion between the Strontium-90 measured in
fetal bone and large changes in fetal mor-
tality in the St. Louis, Mo., area, as well as
a close correspondence between Stronti-
um-90 content of milk and infant mortality
changes throughout the United States.

‘-‘The magnitude of these changes indi-
cate that by 1975, almost one out of ev-
ery two infantsdeaths in the US before
age one may have been due to the unex-
pected effect of Strontium-90 on the genetic
material of the human reproductive cells.”

“We are poisoning ourselves,” exclaim-
ed Professor Sternglass.

. CONSIDERING THIS SITUATION, Dr.
Steriiglass thinks that “the ABM is a waste
of money.” As he states in his paper, “the
situtaion can arise whereby many cities
and their existing populations might sur-
vive a-nuclear war as a result of ABM sys-
tems combined with shelters, only to have
the society come to an end as the infants
born to the survivors die in their first year
of life.”

He continues,  . . all past calculations
as to casualties, ‘loss-exchange ratios’ and
chances of recovery from a major nuclear
war in the presence or absence of anti-
missle systems or shelters become utter-
ly and completely meaningless.”

tists submitted papers for the meeting at

burgh. Indeed, your wealth and power extend far beyond our city’s
borders and rest upon control of giant corporations, political par-
ties, legal, religious, educational institutions and, the mass media.
American democracy notwithstanding, your “votes” are more im-
portant than ours, for you indirectly choose those who may run for
President, and in turn the President chooses from among your

4195‘-anks those who shape American policy at home and abroad. We the
people may vote, protest, applaud or mourn, but you decide.

Thus it is not unfair to lay at your feet both the accomplish-
ments and failures of this society. Its accomplishments are well and
often described, and you have rewarded yourselves handsomely for
these achievements. But even as your affirmative rhetoric and re-
wards increase, so the failures appear and accumulate over more
rapidly. War, racism, poverty, domestic and foreign imperialism,
and most citizens having a continuing sense of failure and empti-
ness because of the crude materialistic goals which it is in your in-
terest to inculcate: these too are the fruits of your vineyard and the
society of which you are the elite.

THOUGH YOU DO not offer up your sons to the war, you do con-
tract to make bombs (U.S. Steel), powder (ALCOA), jet fuel (Gulf),
radar (Westinghouse) and- missle components (‘North American
Rockwell) for the Department of Defense. The list is of course much
longer, and you who control the financial, insurance and legal serv-
ices do not have to be reminded of your intimate and profitable ties

Twith these and other war contractors. The same foreign policy
which led us into Vietnam has protected your investments, and your
raw materials, and your marketsthroughout the‘ world. Stand up and

you may not deserve all the credit, but you’ve done more than your
share.

Poverty and inequality, these too you've worked for. How many
of you have gazed idly from your Washington Plaza apartments
down on the lower Hill District? How many of you have driven
through the North or South Sides en route to the airport for a Euro-

migrate to the “better” Eastern schools while many of your fellow

Dr. Sternglass noted that “neither the

He pointed out, however, that the “military

He emphasized that France and Red

Stony Brook Student Offers New

Plan For Freshman Orientation

(Editor's Note: The following article is the last in a

-series from the Statesman, Stonybroolr, N. Y. Limited
 space prohibits running the entire series, but hopefully

this short article will sum up the problems in current ori-

‘ entation programs. , '

- by STEVEN ROTH

State University of New York at
Stoney Brook.

’ The major theoretical fault with the

, present orientation system lies in the fact
— . that is is a nonflexible, static method. This
~”-coming fall, I will be a senior here; and
,‘the differences between myself and the

freshman will be as vast as those between
my parents and myself. The ideas that were
so controversial to us are now simply taken
a-s a matter of fact.

THIS IS MOST noticeable in the area
of psychedelic drugs and even the harder
-stuff. I you do not believe, just pick up a
paper and read about the latest drug raid
“at. your neighborhood junior high school.

In the past, it has been the practice of

' the orientation organization to play a pro-

gram without ever knowing if it really
applies to incoming freshmen or not. It
has not been until weeks after all the orien-
tations are completed that those in charge
had, any real idea about the people with
whom they were dealing. The first part of
my plan consists of a survey to be com-
pleted by the freshmen themselves. The
questions for this survey will be of an ex-
tremely personal nature such as: ’

Are you avirgin?
Have you ever smoked pot?
Was Stony Brook your first choice?

What is your age, religion, place of resi-
dence, political affiliation, and so on?

The purpose of this survey will be two-
fold. It will not only give the leaders the

 _ ‘knowledge they need, but it will also give

the freshman class a good idea what it is
like. The survey itself can be given in a
very simple and easy manner. It can be sent
to the student with a question sheet, list
of instructions, and a self-addressed stam-
ped envelope. Anonymity will have highest
priority. When the reason for the survey is
explained to the student in detail, I believe
that the response will be very high and the

, -results statistically valid. The compli-
-, ation can be done in a few minutes by the

computers on campus and they in turn can
turn out all the facts and classification

A breakdowns desired. With the aid of these

facts, the planners will be able to see just
_where the new class will differ from the

‘goltifones, where it stands the chance.of fall-

.( The University's orientation program is very similiar
to the program of years age: Although there have been
drastic changes on this campus in past year, the incoming
freshmen are still led to believe that college is just a load
of courses, a load of friends, a load of unanswerable ques-
tions, anda load . . . . .)

ing into the same negative patterns as its
predecessors, where it will need intensi-
fied discussion and in what areas discus-
sion can be kept to a minimum. It will
eliminate all the ambiguity that has sur-
rounded the program and its participants.

THE SECOND MAJOR CHANGE will
be in the number and duration of the or-
ientations themselves. At this point, groups
of 150-250 freshmen at a time come up
for a two-and—ahalf-day stay at some time
between late June and early August. This?
system is filled with inherent difficulties and
errors. Last summer, the orientation lead-
ers had six separate sessions to officiate
at. The first time a student asked them where
the gym was, it was just a question, but the
50th time it was asked, five weeks later, it

"became a point of strong irritation. In

other words, the leaders got very stale (and
understandably so) ﬁnd the students’
interest waned porportionally.

I propose that the freshmen arrive in
two groups, one at the end of August, and
the other at the beginning of September,
to be housed in an entire quad for a period
of five days and four nights. This will en-
sure that the leaders are still fresh, there are
enough people to make any dance or dis-
cussion interesting, and that no one is
inconvenienced. The list of formal acti-
vities should be kept out of the banal, benign
and boring vein that it has been in up to
now. The speakers should be taken from ,
varied and polarized areas, such as a mem-
ber of the Black Panther Party, a member
of the Conservative Party and perhaps an
SDS official. These speakers will all be
chosen to make the freshmen think and ques-
tion. It has previously been the case that
freshmen have had curfews and no pariental
hours. This is just another example of the
stupidity present in the current system.

THE MATERIAL OF the leaders’ dis-
cussions should pertain strictly to the grim
realities of life at the hole, with an emphasis
given to their evolution, present state, and
ways and means of changing them. The
freshmen may.not leave after their orien-
tation expecting milk and honey when they
return, but they will leave armed with the
truth and perhaps a new though or an ori-
ginal idea. _ , A j r

. Beauty Of Life: Diversity And People

by BRUCE LEVENSON
Associate Editor

“4O Years you waste to chase the dollar sign,
So you may die in Florida."
—from “The Ostrich" by Steppenwolf

The beauty of life isn’t to wake up
every morning and knowing exactly what
one is going to do all day long. The beau-
ty of life isn’t a secure niche in the world.
The beauty lies in not knowing what is go-
ing to happen next, in being able to im-
provise and be spontaneous.

The complete structuring of life that is
an American (i.e. United States) ideal that
most of us are subjected to is madness.
Grade school, high school, college, and grad
school years — emphasis not on enjoying
yourself but on acquiring some skills with
which to make money. Parents tell their
children, “Do something with your lives.”
Meaning make money.

Parents envision one goal for their
children — make lots of money. They call
it “looking out for your happiness.” But
the definition of happiness is never yours,
always theirs, happiness equals money. A
corollary to that goal is the degree. Make
the degree to help to make the money.
Then there are a lot of other rules. Like
“don’t do anything that will interfere with
your making the degree, that is, making
the money, that is, being happy.” Don't
wear long hair or wild clothes, “talk
obscenely,” etc. etc. ad infinitum. In other
words let everyone else be your model.
Do what they are doing and you can’t go
wrong.

But what the hell good does a lot of
money do anyway? How many more than

' three pairs of pants does one really need?

Is there something wrong with owning a
car that is three years‘ older or more? or
less than $3000? or not owning a car?
How many more than one house can one
live in at a time?

Of what use are posessions‘? Indian
philosophers say that we horde possessions
because we live in the fear that we will
need them tomorrow. And it is that fear
that makes us horde -

The Yogis also tell us that we must ex-
perience life instead of watching it on a
colored TV. set. We Americans (U. S.
variety) have become great spectators. We
live in a sterile world of vicarious thrills.

Peace March Criticized

Editor, The Pitt News,

I went to the peace march Saturday
out of curiosity. It was boring and unimag-
inative.- It_ accomplished nothing. There
were many feebleminded teenagers at the
peace march. They didn’t give a damn about
peace or freedom or anything else. They
cared about how they looked. They looked
ridiculous.

The speakers spoke as though some-
one was listening. Some were, some were
not. The people at whose principles the peace
march was directed were not there. The
principles in question, therefore, were re-
solutely evaded. No minds were swayed,
because no minds that needed to be swayed
were in attendance. And when you take
away the feebleminded teenagers, and the
people with short hair who went to take
pictures of people with long" hair, and the
people with long hair who went to take
pictures of each other, very few minds at
all were there.

Everything at the peace march was ab-
solutely peachy. No one in the peace march
disagreed with anyone else in the peace
march. They all wanted peace and they all
wanted freedom. In this respect they are
part of a very vast majority. To admit one-
self part of a vast majority, though, is
very unfashionable. Condescending to

group masochism is more dernier’ cri’.

People who were in the peace march do
not eat grapes. Someone in the peace
march carried a sign that said “Nixon eats
grapes.” He probably does. I don’t blame .-
. him. If I were he I would eat grapes --

. r

taurant is an exciting evening? (God Pity
us‘.) A friend of mine who has a lot of spend-
ing money is caught shoplifting and is
prosecuted by the law. I asked him why he
steals and he says it gives him “a thrill.”

These are the kinds of thrills that we are
reduced to in 1984 minus 15.

It is better to keep your cool than show
some emotion about anything. The man
who is “cool” pretends that nothing ex-
cites him, the man who is “moral” doesn’t
get excited over anything. Emotion has be-
come “sinful.”

The moralist tells us that sex is base
and anima_l. And we US Americans suck up

re

thatdrivel. So we either pretend that we 

never have nor desire sex except in a “love”
situation which makes the “ugly” practice
acceptable. So we knock off our horns vi-
cariously. We make sex novels best sellers
and great movies. We’d rather watch the
Calgon girl in the bathtub than ball her.
And the purists in a University Department
tell us that they never read the Pitt News
because is has “filthy” words in it. At
the same time that they are telling this to
a staff reporter they are scrutizing the
newspaper for pornos. Passing over the con-
tent of the articles, just seeking out the
dirt.” -

Tuli Kupferberg of the Fugs says that
all the troubles with this country originate
with politicians who are basically “anti-

» fuck.” This statement implies a lot of other

things besides sex. People are more plain-
ly anti-fun. .-

What is wrong with sex? Is the Human
body ugly ? Are parts of it ugly? I think not.
People are beautiful. Everything about
them is beautiful.

The greatest beauty‘ of life and of people
is diversity. Why are people forever trying
to break us down and put us into a mold?

Nothing is more obscene to me than
walking into a downtown restaurant at noon
during a workday. Wall-to-wall black
suits, white shirts, thin ties,.and pointy-
toed shoes. Any number could easily be
mistaken for another.

The greatest sin of this society is to break I
from the white-Anglo-Saxon—Christian-
money-oriented mold.

“Alli ask of livin’ is to hang no chains on me,
And all I ask of dyin’ is to go naturally.”

I —from “And When lDie”

by Blood, Sweat, and Tears

 

I expensive grapes — three meals a day, in-
protest of such an uncreative society. The
peace march was preposterous. I shall not
go to any more.

Reader Calls For Tolerance.

Editor, The Pitt News,

First, I would like to make two things
clear: (1) I respect any persons religious
beliefs, and (2) I do not think it is right to
swear by anyone’s name, whether great or
small, diety or devil. But — if I had to Judge
Mr. Hawk on his one letter, which I don’t
I would suspect he is on the level that Paul

‘ ".l..—.....~.s...-t

-,,_4

._..

llmz‘ .‘

Stoller is allegedly on. I say this, not be-‘'’@ -

cause Mr. Hawk has the courage to express
something‘ he strongly believes, but be-
cause he does it with worn cliches that dog-
matic fundamentalists never tire of V0-
calizing.

Secondly, the use of profanity does not
indicate a lack of culture or education be-
fitting a graduate. “Profane” pharases,
although usually without literal meaning,
often express moods or. feelings best be-
cause their “profanity” gives them such
great impact. I would hope, however,
that an education at Pitt would instill a
sufficient level of tolerance and respect to
discourage blasphemy.

Bram hall Talks Cours

Curriculum Review Com-
mittee Chairman Dave Bram-
hall, an economics professor,
believes that universities
should provide an environment
for learning in which the stu-
dent receives “credit for hav-
ing grown and enriched himself.

Bramhall envisions the Com-
mittee as more than just curricu-
lar review. “It will be more fun-
damental and wide—reaching.” The
committee (which has not yet
been chosen) will rely heavily on
‘feedback to aid it in formulating
its recommendations that will be
presented to the Undergraduate
Council in March, 1970, and ulti-
mately to the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences.

In addition to Bramhall, the
committee will consist of three
students chosen by the Arts and
Sciences Cabinet and four faculty
members appointed by the Under-
graduate Council.

The operation of the Commit-
tee will be entirely open. Bram-
hall will encourage the total Uni-
versity community to participate
in the review. To involve the apa-
thetic masses, he will conduct
’meetings in any place that is con-
venient, on the lawn, in the cafe-
teria, fraternity houses, dorms,
etc. Faculty involvement will also
be encouraged. In addition, parti-
cipation will be welcomed from
trustees, alumni, and legislators.
If anything is to be accomplish
ed,” said Bramhall, “It is critical
that we have wide participation.”

Prof. Lee
Rapped

by DAVE TIERNAN
Editor, Pitt News

One of the best newspapers in
the city has shown .its ardent de-
sire to distort the college scene
by running a half-page story, car-
toon, and editorial comment about
the “oncoming generation” writ-
ten by what they call a “conscien-
tious professor who closely ob-
serves the current turmoil on cam-

pus,” the University’s Lawrence

Lee.

Well, I don’t claim to know ev-
ery teacher here, but I really don’t
recall seeing Lee at any meetings,
confrontations, discussions, work-
shops, or at any Concerned Stu-
dent-Faculty activities. Not that
he must take part in anything to
be the authority he claims to be,
but at least to -hear the real be-
liefs, ideas, problems, and -de-
sires of this generation — not the
distorted rehash of the same in
the local or national propaganda
sheets.

What really struck ‘me funny
was that Lee’s attack of this gen-
eration was aimed at one of the

_ most archaic, conservative, and

unchanging arms of the old gener-
ation — a social fraternity. Surely
if he is the close observer that the
paper claims he is, he would real-

~ ize that the fraternities are sit-

ting complacently on their fat be-
hinds while the University admin-
istration promises and promises
that a row of fraternity houses will
be built.

LEE NOTES in his speech that
in addition to being childish and
irresponsible, this generation has
ruined the lives and careers of ten
to 12 Chancellors and numerous
deans. He fails to note that the
majority of campus “headaches”
have been caused by students who

want to imporve the lives of thou- .
sands, be they blacks, Vietnamese .
V . poor,,students, or. membe_rs of the V
' .'_older,_igeneration._ ' A A "C 

 
 

Bramhall favors the elimina-
tion of the authoritarianism that
is implied by grading. He feels
that it is necessary to blur the
status difference between stu-
dent and teacher. The committee
chairman wants the professor to
keep his authority but relinquish
his authoritarianism.

The classroom atmosphere
would consist of a group of people
“all of whose experience is re-
garded as important.” The teach-
er would also learn from the stu-
dent.

“Freshmen get in the largest
courses,” said Bramhall, “when
they should be getting in the small-
est.” He advocates a general re-
versal of the average class size.

He is not certain that there
should be classes for freshmen
and sophomores. Bramhall sug-
gested that they experience in a
total learning evnironment in
which they are able to choose
from a “smorgasbord of educa-
tion.” Formal and informal groups
of students would meet and util-
ize films, lectures, laboratories,
and existing courses as they’ suit
their needs. They would sit in on
what they want and when they
want.

The wall between curricular
and extra-curricular activities,
according to the economics pro-
fessor, should be broken down.
These activities and social or
community work should be equal
parts of the learning experience.

Specialization would take place
in the last two years, but the op-

I can understand Lee, or any
other person, not condoning the
confrontation politics used by
some campus radicals. But can’t
he understand that the radicals
and their liberal followers believe
in what they are doing, and that

. they merely want to improve the

country for the majority?

He mentions the “Storm Troop-
er tactics” of our generation, and
later advises the younger genera-
tion until we, too, are old. The very
reason his so—called “storm troop-
er” tactics are necessary some
places in the country is-that the
older generation, in the form of
ministrators, teachers, and trus-
tees, will not listen to the ideas of
the younger generation.

LEE OVERLOOKS the fact that
here at the University the stu-
dents have been listened to by
both the administration and fac-
culty and storm trooper tactis
have been unnecessary.

But even greater than his com-
plete misunderstanding of stu-

‘dents here and across the country

is Lee’s basic philosophy about

’ academic life. Early in his ta-lk he

mentions that Universities have
given great opportunities ‘to stu-
dents. He concludes by saying
that all generations need the help
of others, and that his generation
is merely asking ours to be men,
less some frightened tyrant seeks
to make slavesof all of us in re-
action to our irresponsibility.

All Lee seems to say is that he
is an old, conceited, senile, scared
man who has no faith in that which
is not his (ideas, beliefs, etc. ).
and rather than try to understand
or even find out those other ideas
are,‘ condemns a whole generation
for the extreme and violent action
of a few. ‘

This seems to be a very naive,
narrow-minded outlook for a man
who is. supposedly a “conscienti-.

ous professor who. closely ob- .
serves the currentfturmoil‘ on the A

tion would be open for another two
years of “free” education. “Most
of what people need in majors
they could get in two years,” said
Bramhall. He mentioned that
there are a lot of existing models
of similar systems citing State
University of New York at Old
Westbury and Ben Salem College
(affiliated with Fordham Univer-
sity) as examples. This type of
structure might open the possi-
bility of offering a self-evaluative
degree as well as the standard de-
grees that the University makes
available. ~

Must Handicapped (Students Take Over University,-
Building Or(Breai<‘ Law In Order To Be. Heard?

by CARLA SYDNEY STONE
Staff News Writer

How long does it take you to get
to Schenley Cafeteria from the
Towers? Two minutes? Less? In
an interview with David Weir, a
quadapelegic graduate student in
Special Education and Rehabilita-
tion, The Pitt News learned that
that it takes the average wheel-

chair student one hour to wheel

from the Towers Dorms to meals
and one hour back. Consequently,
even they had to pay for a full
meal ticket, most handicapped

students must eat elsewhere.

‘WIIIIIIIjljljljliljljliljljljl

'.-Hz, but in such rm ugly time

The true protest is beauty

the curriculum that they should be
restructured. They should express
what the course means to citizens
and social responsibility, accord-
ing to the chairman. Bramhall
also feels that a first course should
include a history of the subject
and should be related to contem-
porary or future events.

He also mentioned the possib-
ility of a general introductory
course such as social science. It
would answer questions such as:
How_ does a social scientist find
truth? What is the meaning of
statistics? Of observation? How
does a social science differ from a
natural science?

In a speech this May at the
ground-breaking ceremonies of
the Home for Crippled Children,

.Mr. Weir wondered “if the handi-

capped student of the University
of Pittsburgh must break a law,
must take over the computer cen-
ter” in order to make their prob-
lem known: He questioned wheth-
er these students “have to destroy
something or hurt someone be-
fore we can get Chancellor Pos-
var’s ear . . . to have the Univer-
sity become people relevant, rath-
er than urban or suburban rele-
vant or any other catchy name rel-
evant.”

University Is More
Than Just Classes

by MARK DURANKO
Staff News Writer

Gary" Mallinger received his
degree in biophysics from the
University‘ this year. If that
were all he had done, his pro-
file would not appear in the
Pitt News. Gary realized that
there was more to the Univer-
sity than classes and grade re-
ports. He therefore involved
himself in the extracurricular
lif_e of the University, “be-
cause I perceived many things
wrong with Pitt, and I wanted
to participate in changing
them.

From his experience on the
Liberal Arts Cabinet, Gary is
aware of the many proposals re-
garding changes in the grad-
ing system. He feels that before
one can question in the notion of
grades, one must first “define
the University and its goals.”
Particularly, Gary thinks that
the University is too responsive to
the needs of society, and has let
society define it. This respon-
siveness has led to the entire de-
gree system.

He does not, however, advocate
the abolishment of the system be-
cause he fears that “students gen-
erally are not motivated enough”

to pursue an independent program.

He does agree with the general
concept of Satisfactory/Unsatis-
factory grading and would also
like to see the failing grade re-
placed with a no-credit grade.

Generally, Gary is in favor of
the present academic reforms,
though he feels that much re-
mains to be done. He would like
to see the Course Evaluation Com-
mittee strengthened to shwere
“faculty members can be called
upon to defend bad evaluations.”

He also sees less friction between
the newly appointed Dean of the
College of Arts and Sciences,
Doctor Schneewind, and students,
remarking that “he (Schneewind)
will be more responsive to stu-
dent demands, but will be firm if
outrageous demands are made.”
Gary also saw a “tremendous
decrease in student apathy” in
his four years at the University.
In the future, he sees student in-
terest increasing in all phases of
University life,‘ particularly in
the areas of present reform, com-
menting that “while the reforms
have been initiated by a small
minority, the majority will soon
become involved.” To this end,
he wants to see the Student Gov-
ernment reorganized,‘ to encourage
this participation. Presently,
“anyone elected to the senatorial
post has his hands tied,” and this
should end with reorganization.

On the ever present issue of
campus violence, Gary is unequi-
vocally against force or weapons
of any kind on campus, whether
it is tied to the students or ad-
ministration. He forsees in-
mediate state action, though, if
anything does develop, “because
in a situation like that, the Chan-
cellor’s hands are tied.”

When asked about the com-
muter problems, the reasons
that they will get worse before
they get better, due to the fact
that “the size of the problem de-
fies solution.” While he himself
was a commuter only during his
freshman year, Gary is aware of
the restriction placed on the Com-
muter, “since he cannot get back
on the campus inthe evenings.”

Gary was pleased by the recent
Flaherty victory in the primary,
because it “chipped away” at
the party which “denied the nom-
ination to Gene McCarthy last

Tuesday, May 27, 1969-—THE PITT NEWS—Page 7

...Crrr;y Mrtllirtger

year.” He thinks that Flaherty,
if elected, will make the city ad-
ministration more responsive to
the needs and desires of the people,
but he will reserve judgements of
Flaherty as mayor till he is in of-

fice for a while.

Touching on Vietnam, Gary
judged President Richard Nixon’s
recent speech to be “hopeless
because is just reiterates the old
Johnson line.” He believes the
war to be the cause of all or most
of the student demonstrations be-
cause it has caused people to ques-
tion their government more than
they would otherwise. He views

‘the present discussions of the Anti-

Ballistic Missile system to be in-
dicative of’ an upcoming “strug-

 _

gle between thecivilian and mili-
tary authority, with the Congress
eventually winning out.”

He also sees changes in the na-
tional ROTC program being init-
iated to make it more academic.

For the future, Gary sees in-
ceased student influence in the
decision making processes of the
University, and more student in-
volvement in other-areas of Uni-
versity life.

Chishohn

Criticizes

°Older Ones’

Congresswoman Shirley Chis-
holm, appearing before the
House Special Subcommittee on
Education May 19, criticized
“Older persons who seem deter-
mined to misunderstand and over
simplify this ‘student unrest’ as
they callit.”

She felt that if the committee
really wanted to get to the roots
of the ‘problem,’ then it should lis-
ten to the students themselves
“and not so much from college
presidents, state officials, psycho-
logists and federal officials.”

She brought up the incident at
Cornell as an illustration “that
what is happening on our cam-
puses cannot be understood with-
out relating it to all the other pro-
blems of our time — to racism, to
economic injustice, to the terri-
bly mistaken war we are caught
in.” Representative Chisholm
felt that students today are “prod-
ucts of an unjust, racist society that
spends more on war than it does
on education and medicine.

Mrs. Chisholm suggests that
Congress might begin by conduc-
ting hearings on the report of the

Carnegie Commission on Higher-

Education which recommended
that colleges should be open to
every student, however poor,
who is able to learn.

 North In

by ED CONLEY

_ A couple of district base-
ball coaches left the game in
style Sunday, even though one
‘of them was officially a loser.

Both Doc Skender and Owen
Daugherty, outgoing mentors
at Duquesne and Indiana, were

staging of the Tri-State Baseball
Coaches Association All-Star
Game and each was rewarded
with a moment of applause from
the fans.

g.-Daugherty, president of the
coaches group, organized the en-
counter but wasn’t involved with
‘-the actual playing of the game.
‘However, the North-South battle
certainly proved to be a healthy
,‘_fbaby’n’ for the retiring coach.

RON O’GRODNIK did a lot of running- in the All-Star Game at

and drew a walk in three trips to the plate. He was the final starter to
leave the game for the North when he departed in the eighth inning.

Ron O’Grodnik singled in the

a lot of action.on the base paths

A few innings later, O’Grodnik

. Ten racksters Visit Rutgers
  For IC4_«A’s Top Competition

by BOB LEDERMAN

 When Jim Banner’s trackmen pack theirbags and head for
‘ New Brunswick, N. J ., this Thursday, it won’t be for a vacation

of any sorts. The tracksters are headed East for the IC4A’s which _
is this year, hosted by Rutgers University Friday and Saturday.
‘ Although the thinclads number only ten for the All-Eastern school

meet, they are by no means inferior in caliber. The tracksters are aim-
 ing high and have been keeping in shape during the past two weeks by

5‘-5 daily workouts in the Stadium.

 ..“The_, boys have just been run-
hing to keep sharp,” remarked
Xassistant Coach Gary Meckley.
fﬁ“‘We haven’t been running them
 into. the ground. If they don’t have
2 it by now, they never will.”

if G Slated to run the mile relay
T" -are Wally Swiger, Rudy Hufnagle,

Carlos Reisen and,Smitty Brown.
The mile relay has been a consis-

tently strong event for the thin-

clads during the past season,
but Villanova, a well-known track
powerhouse seems quite capable
of providing the men of Banner with
a down-to-the-tape battle.

‘‘Both of them, Solonickne and
O’Grodnik,” Lewis said, “had two
hits. They played nice ball.”

“It was a good baseball game,
overall,” he added. “All they guys
played well.”

There were a few more peo-
ple in attendance than usual for
a college game, but the crowd
was definitely not. a good “All-
Star” group. '

Lewis insisted, however, “It
was a pretty good turnout, con-
sidering it was the first time, and
that there wasn’t much publicity.
We met expenses.”

The coach must have realized
that the gathering wasn’t enormous
though. Particularly, in the seventh
inning when a woman’s cry brought
laughter to the entire throng. Her
voice wasn’t too loud, but every-
one heard her scream, “Hey ump!
Tell the scoreboard to change!”

In the two-mile race, Mark
Vornhagen will be the lone thin
clad entry. Among the field of

ter a face long familiar to local.
track enthusiasts — West Vir-
ginia’s Mark Hatfield. And as al-
ways, Hatfield is expected to pro-
vide a stiff challenge to the thin-
clad hopeful.

Jerry‘ Richey, accustomed to
middle distance running this past
season (one, and two mile races,
will get a “change of pace” this
weekend when he runs in the
three mile competition.

“Jerry prefers a longer dis-
tance in a race,” commented
Meckley. “He’ll definitely be -
one of our stronger entries.” -

ll70n1en’s Rigltts

And The Taboo

 

 

by MARTHA HARTLE
Associate Sports Editor

Women’s rights and freedoms are hot topics -these days
and we gals.have our problems in the sports world as well as
in the realms of business, employment, politics etc.

On a sportscastthe other night, I heardabout a female ten-
nis player from Tulane University. She was the first girl inf”
that school’s history to win a letter in a varsity sport, yet she
still had her problems. Many of the opponent schools refused to
compete against her simply because she was a girl. I suppose
the male ego would be deflated if he would somehow lose to
a female opponent. This Tulane co-ed,_ by the way, is oneof
the top ranked amatuers in the country and plays a man’s game
of tennis. No wonder so many gu-ysirefuised to play!

There’s a female tennis player on the Erostburg State var-
sity, but her problems were a little different. It’s difficult to ’
manage her showers and motel facilities on road matches.
But so far she hasn’t let these obstacles stand in her way. She’s

. having a successful season against male opposition.

The most publicized example of . the woman’s fight for
rights in the world of sports has come in horse racing where
Barbara Rubin fought and won. Through her efforts, Miss Ru- -
bin has opened the way for scores of other female jockeys and
her example will undoubtedly be carried through in other sports A_._
as well. " 

Locally, the varsity rifle team boasted a girl on the squad
this winter and she did an exceptional job. It’s also possible
for the gals to participatein varsity tennis if they choose, but
so far no one has made the effort. Of course, it hasn’t exactly
been made public information that girls are welcome to try
out for the net "squad. But glancing at the current tennis
team’s record (0-11), the netters could have used some help
this spring, male or female. - ’

Very few people knew about the varsity fencing squad on
campus last year. We had one. Rather we had her. Judy Le-
wandowski was a one-woman fencing team and she’ll be back
again next year tackling top flight Eastern competition.

There -seems to be some kind of taboo, however, against a
woman who tries to compete in the so-called man’s world,
expecially in sports. The age-old advice of “naturally you're
going to let him win, even if you can beat him” has been taken
for granted.

V But times, they are a changin.

Girls are playing touch football in the quad, and they" re
jogging in the park. In the state of Iowa, girls’ basketball is
more popular than the boys’ version of that sport. Yes, the times
are a changin’, and maybe next year we’ll seefemale jockeys .
in the Kentucky Derby and femaletennis players on Trees
courts. Maybe we’ll see a female champ. Wouldn’t that be
nice?

Net Squad Loses

Stromp

Again;
I rks Ben Pope

As if struggling through eleven matches without a victory
isn’t enough tennis coach Ben Pope right is faced with yet an-

other crisis.

Pope’s original number one man, Tom Stromp, has decided to for-
sake his team and his coach in all but one of the remaining matches.

He happens to be the only netter
on scholarship, but also is con-
sidered to be the prize prima dona
that Pope has ever dealt with.

Last season Stromp promised
that if he were given a scholar-
ship, he’s devote all his time to
tennis. This season, however, he
has the scholarship but has decid-
ed not to take off from his job for
the few remaining matches
scheduled during the weekdays.

“He’s a crooked politician,”
stated Pope. “He’s not going through
with his obligation and is on his
own, doing what, he wants to do.
He’s getting alot and giving as
little as possible.” In addition,

. Pope remarked that Mike Dza-
dousky is getting off from work
both Monday and Tuesday, and he
doesn’t even have a scholarship.

The coach mentioned that the
spirit that Stromp instills in the
other players does nothing for
the squad’s morale. “He’s our
big problem right now. Stromp
should be the captain and most

-— valuable player, but he turned out
backwards. It’s too bad he got
the scholarship. He doesn’t ap-
preciate it.”

Last Saturday the netters lost
to Allegheny, 7-2 as Mike Riggle,
Pope’s new number one man, won
6-1, 6-3. Gerry l3uden edged past
Jim Johnston 1-6, 6-2, and 14-12.
Stromp did not compete in the
singles matches, but he and Mike
Dzadousky lost in doubles 6-4
and 6-2.

Stromp would have competed as
the number two man in the singles
matches except for the fact that
he stepped onto the tennis courts
ten or fifteen minutes‘ after the ‘
match started. Again Pope’s blood
pressure rose like a streaking flame.

“He knows how‘ to tell time.

Stromp’s a disgrace to Pitt tennis.

He doesnit even come out for prac-

tice. He doesn’t rate playing with

g his teammates-saying that he.

“ can’t get any practice playing

with them. He doesn’t care about

helping them. He’s taken a scho-

larship and isn’t abiding by it,”
growled Pope.

_ Today Pope and his netmen, with
or without Tom Stromp, will give
their all against visiting Hiram

After 7-6 Mark

 
  

Lewis Looks Forward

by ED CON LEY

Some people may give him an argument, but Bobby Lewis
insists his Panther nine had a winning season this spring. The

record was 7-6, wasn’t it?

A poor Florida “exhibition” tour in April places doubt on the ac-
curacy of such a record, though. The critics say that 1-6 in the Sun-
shine State means the work was actually 8-12.

"‘No! ” Lewis says. “I don’t think
those games should count. No-
body up North ever comes out of
a trip like that with a winning
record. It’s too rough, and they
play more games down there.”

The answer to the argument
doesn’t really matter because a’
7-6 mark is a big drop from the
“official” 16-9 finish of last
spring anyway.

“Yes, some games "were dis-
appointing, but some weren’t,”
Lewis decided. “There were a lot
of them that we could of won, and
didn’t.”

The coach said that with thoughts

of the numerousverrors

that hurt the mitters moreithan any-

thing else. Once they lost a game
on seven errors, and another time
they dropped one when they sur-
rendered seven unearned runs.

“But, I’m looking forward to
next year — maybe in the fall, if

‘we can get some games in,”

Lewis mentioned. “We’ll have
everybody back, except a few.”

The mitters will lose only
three players. Relief pitcher Rich
Orpneck, third baseman Ricky
Synder, and catcher Sammy Glass
are the graduates.

All of the others will be back,
and that group’ includes the
squad’s MVP and leading RBI
man, Joe McCain; the new cap-
tain, Cliff Brown; this spring’s
leading hitter, - Frank Gustine;
and a couple of mighty good all-
round players in Bob Solonickne
and Ron O’Grodnik. If these
players come through again next
year there’s no reason why the
mitters won’t be able to continue
the big .290 hi_tting pace that
they’ve been swinging at as a
team.

The pitching looked better-

than-average this year, too. And,
with George Medich and Mike
Niccols being helped by Tulane
transfer, Frank Mincarelli next
spring the mitters should be able

HELP!!!

to have winning season, with or
without an exhibition record.

Of course, like this year, hit-
ting and pitching will not be
enough if the unearned runs begin
to appear on the opposition’s
side of the scorecard.

Golf Team Hosts 
In Final Shannopin Contest

The Golf team hosts Allegheny this afternoon at Shannopin
Country Club. The match, which will start at 1:30 p.m., is the
last home contest of the 1969 season. I ' ’ : i

“We beat them last year,” recalls coach Rex Peery, “I should hope

we could beat them again.”

Peery’s men will have an eas-
ier time against Allegheny than
they did against Navy. At the
Naval Academy Saturday, the gol-
fers were dubbed handily, 7-0.

The only close match against
Navy was fought by Sam Zinger,
competing in. the number five
spot. Zinger missed a 3-foot put
in the eithteenth hole and lost
one-up.

Earlier in the week, the links-
men grabbed their fourth vic-
tory against Carnegie-Mellon
when they copped 5 out of 6

matches. John Meteney, Charles _

Patrick, Mike McGuire, Zinger;
and Ray George each won their
-match. Only Joe Volansky lost.
He was defeated 3-2 by CMU’s
Sam Janis.

The golf team stands four wins,
seven losses going into "this af-
ternoon’s clash. Coach Peery and

his men may not see another victory

after they face Allegheny, so the
Lmksmen will be extra-inspired
to win.

In four days, the golf team bows
out of this long season against
Penn State on the Lions’ home
courses. Peery isn’t over-anxious
because PSU dumped Navy on
the Naval Academy’s home course
earlier in the year.

Orientation Revision

 

 

(See Page Four)

by BOB BON N
Staff News Writer

Most University students re-
member their freshman orienta-
tion session with a feeling that
they were being talked down to,
with a -feeling that they were bor-
ed, and with a feeling that they
really didn’t learn very much
about the University.

To remedy these problems, this
year’s SG Undergraduate Orien-
tation Committee is out to change
the orientation program. The com-

' mittee is sponsored by the Office

 

of the Dean of Students and coor-
dinated by Ronald. Cowell.

According to Dave Guydan,

 chairman of the committee, the
' key is including more participa-

tion of upperclass students.

“In this age of student aware-
_ness,” Guydan said, “who can bet-
ter tell the new freshmen what

I ‘ to expect than a student?”

The new idea in orientation,
which Guydan referred to as a

, f‘personal touch,” is to try to get

the freshmen to talk with upper-
class students about major sub-
jects, such as why they are com-
ing to the University in the first
place, rather than listening to fac-
ulty or administrators talk about
minor questions like where Clapp
Hall is located.

Each host or hostess will have

no more than 15 students under-

his wing.

Many opportunities for discus-
sion to occur are in the program.
A panel discussion known as “Pitt
Issues ’69” will consist of stu-
dent leaders discussing important
questions on the University and
will invite comments and ques-
tions from the freshmen. This
was a big success at last sum-
mer’s orientation.

At another meeting, all orien-
tees will read an article called
“Student Stress and Student De-

velopment,” which talks about
student unrest and reasons for
change on many campuses. This
will serve as another kickoff
point for discussion, this time in
small groups with the hosts and
hostesses.

On the recreational side, there
will be a Sudent Union Night,
with the Ballroom turned into a
Monte Carlo sort of thing. There
will be refreshments, a live band,
and a variety of games such as
roulette and casino. The new
frosh will also get free use of the
pool tables.

In addition, there will be a cruise
on the “Party Liner,” which prov-
ed to be one of the most popular
activities at last year’s orienta-
tion. Both of these will afford an
excellent opportunity for the new
freshmen to mix and get to know
each other better.

Some aspects of orientation will
remain basically the same, how-
ever. Registration is one of the
major reasons for having an ori-
entation session. The various
schools in the University — nurs-
ing, engineering, and the college—
will have their own programming
and registration.

To help with at least one deci-
sion, there will be a program on

whether to take it is sometimes

nar, which consisted of nine ten-
minute speeches, has been re-
placed by a booklet which will ex-
plain the various functions of the
Student Aid Office, the Placement
Service, etc.

A new Faculty Seminar will
consist of 13 lectures by different
faculty members on their respec-
tive subjects. The frosh will have
time to attend about four of these
lectures and will get their first
taste of a college classroom situa-
tion. '

There will also be a parent's
program and a new slide presen-
tation on student life.

  The graduation oar.
  Any questions?

Q. Why did we make it this size?

A. Maverick pinches pennies, not people. We gave
Maverick more leg room. More shoulder room. More
luggage room. Maverick’s front seat offers nine
inches more shoulder room than the front seat of
the leading economy import.

Q. What do I get for the price?

A. You get your money's worth. A complete,
built—for-Americans kind of car. Room. Hot styling.
Co|or—keyed interiors.

Q. What kind of gas mileage can I get?

A. That depends on you as well as the car. You can get
as much as 25 or 26 miles per gallon—if you have
an educated toe and the right road conditions. If you
have a lead foot, or do a lot of city driving, you
will get a lot less. In tests by professional drivers at
our tracks, where we do our best to duplicate actual
driving‘ conditions, Maverick averaged 22.5 mpg.

Q. What kind of power does Maveri/ck have?

A. Maverick’s Six lets loose‘105 galloping horses. That’s

52 more than you get in the VW 1500. Maverick

can cover 417 feet in ten seconds from a standing
start. When you enter a 70—mph turnpike, you

won't feel like a retired bookkeeper thrust into the
middle of a pro football game.

0. If it has an eight-inch longer wheelbase than the
import, does it still handle and park easily?

A. Maverick’s turning circle is 35.6 feet (vs. 36 feet for
its leading import rival); Maverick can slant through
traffic like a halfback. It makes you a better driver
because of the nimble way it handles in traffic, goes
around corners and slides into tight parking spots.

0. Can a small car be safe? And how safe is safe?

A. This small car incorporates all the latest advances
in engineering. Its brakes are as big’ as a standard
compact’s—designed to stop cars weighing hundreds
of pounds more. Maverick gives you weight . . .
power . . . stability . . . designed for greater peace
