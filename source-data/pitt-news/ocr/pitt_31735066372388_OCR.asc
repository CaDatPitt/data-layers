Egypt Journalist: SadatHad Darker Side

By SCOT STONE

There is a darker side to life in
Egypt than the one Americans are
used to seeing in television news
reels. according to the editor of a
prominent anti‘-government journal
in Egypt.

Tajir Abed El Hakim. journalist
and editor of the AI-Tadamon. an
organ of the National Democratic
Movement in Egypt. told a Pitt
audience Wednesday ‘night that
because of wide—spread opposition
to Anwar Sadat’s peace plan with
Israel. thousands of intellectuals.

* students. and politically active reli-

gious leaders have been jailed or
exiled within the country.

El Hakim charged the new
government of Hosni Mubarek with
bringing a “new dimension" to the
repression in Egypt.

He said that a complete state of
emergency. and the recent passage

‘of the so—called “shameless conduct”

law. have increased the dimensions
of arrests. and have led to the open-
ing of two concentration camps»-
one in the Sinai and one in upper
Egypt

A I980 report by Amnesty Inter-
national verified most of El Hakim’s
allegation. especially concerning
arrests. The report further states
that systematic torture and the exe-
cution of prisoners takes place on a
regular basis.

El Hakim began his career as a
political columnist at a Cairo news-
paper called Al-Ghmhourya. When
Sadat ca-me to power inil969. he
required journalists to take a loyalty
oath. El Hakim refused. on grounds
of conscience. and eventually fled
the country.

“First my writing was suppressed.

   
 

then my editor gave me a choice:
either write in support of Sadat. or
we won’t publish your work." El
Hakim said. “Eventually there were
security guards outside my home. I
had to leave Egypt.”

El Hakimcalled Sadat a dictator.
and said that he is responsible for

any factionalism troubling Egypt.

 
 

He said that in Sadat's pursuit of
power. Sadat had an ideological
vacuum that he filled with religion.
“He called himself an Islamic
president of an Islamic nation,“ El
Hakim said. “This went against the
basic pride of all Egyptians in their
tradition of religious tolerance."-

  RUM

A-21: Looking at a Federal Regulation

By SETH LUBOVE

lt may be bureaucratic. it may be
overly intrusive. it may be just a
royal pain in the neck. but the string-
est accounting ‘requirements found
in Circular A-2| are going to rear
their heads on university campuses
nationwide courtesy ofthe Offices of
Management and Budget and
Congress.

Should the faculty go along with
the requirements. albeit grudgingly‘?
Or should they fight A-2| and
attempt to substantially water it
down‘? The Pitt News asked faculty
and administrators these and other
questions. the answers to which fol-
low. edited for length and clarity.

John Armstrong,
Graduate School
of Public Health

There are two contentions: one is
that why should people in academic

‘ life have to report to the government

about what they do with their time
that is not on government-
sponsored activities. That’s causing
a certain amount of argument. And
the second thing is that (the govern-
ment has) decided the categories of
your time and activities.

It seems to those of us who carry
out the activities that the categories
are overlapping and yet have to add
up to l00 percent. Let‘s consider an
example: if you are teaching gradu-
ate students. the whole essence of
graduate teaching is research. and
yet teaching and research are largely

' divided in the classification that they

give you. And therefore the time
spent on one is not supposed to be
time spent on the other--«but of
course it is. --

So. in essence. one has to make
compromises on this which are not

strictly honest in my mind: for
example, putting the time down and
pretending you‘re dividing the time
into this and that. when you’re not
really. And you have to make arbi-
trary decisions: ‘Well. l’ll charge so
much to teaching and so much to
research. whereas really the activity
is not divideable it‘s the same
activity.

So those are the two principle
concerns to the teaching people. I
think to the administrative side of
the university. A-2| isjust causing a
tremendous lot of reporting busy-
work that probably the administra-
tive side of the university could tell
you more about than l can. But they
tell us that it is a real task and an
expensive task to keep up with the
additional reporting requirements.

l’m sure (the administration) will
accomplish something that will be
acceptable to the agency. l don’t
think though that it is profitable. l
think it's really a waste of the tax-
payers money. frankly. Because the
way in which they‘re going to
account for it is more detailed than I
think is required by accountability.
And I do believethat those ofus who
are spending taxpayers’ money must
be acceountable.

l do a lot of research. the money is
given to us for research by the
government. by other people. and of
course we must be accountable. And
we must spend it in the most eco-
nomical way possible. But at the
same time when the accounting part

becomes an obstacle to doing the

work. well. that’s too much. It’s not
helping anyone.

The universities are in a position
where the income is not keeping
pace with inﬂation. and they have
really tightened their belts. They’re
certainly in no position to be spend-
ing extraimoney on something that
is not producing.

l think there’s two things (that
should be done): one of them is so
minor that I can’t think why they
won‘t do it. And that is to simply
make the reporting requirements on
time more consistent with the actual
activities of faculty members who
perform. And it seems to me
extraordinary that they won‘t even
budge on such a minor thing as that.

And the second thing is. I think at
a much more fundamental level.
somebody should be questioning
whether they are not overextending
the appropriateness of government
intervention in the matter of what
you’re supposed to report to the
government; whether they really
should be in the business oftryingto
account for time that is not spent on
government-sponsored activities.

I don't think of it as a personal
burden. l would be prepared to
extend that much burden to myself.
lt's not the burden that I object to. l
don’t like doing things that don‘t
make sense. I don’t like doing things
that l know are unproductive. and I
do really rather resent the intrusion
of the government into areas that I
think don‘t concern it.

But l certainly don't object to
doing whatever i have to do to
remain accountable to the people.

I think the thing is that one has to
get somebody who is politically
important to listen to one and hope-
fully understand what these prob-

lems are.
I think the intention is correct. l

don't see anything wrong with their
intention of reasonable accountabil-
ity. I don’t want to see sloppy
accounting at the university using

the peoples’ money. I don‘t think‘

anybody does. it's simply that
they've chosen methods I think are
inappropriate and time-wasting.

I would hopethat eventuallygood
sense will prevail and that we'll find
a better method of being acountable.

What happened is that a few years
ago the federal agencies responsible
for auditing the expenditure of fed-
eral funds for research and spon-
sored programs changed their
auditing requirements. in doing so.
they applied far more rigorous and
stringent rules to document the way
in which people spent their time and
used equipment and that kind of
thing. And virtually all major
research universities across the
country. including our own. were
found to have inadequate systems of
documentation to support charges
that had been made against govern-
ment contracts.

Here. for example. they brought
into question some $20 million
worth of salaries because the faculty
member or the department had not
maintained sufficiently detailed
records of what he actually did to
certify to the satisfaction ofthe audi-
tors that he had in fact spent that

‘amount of time on the contract. We

followed a general practice here and
at all other universities ofpermitting
secretaries and clerks to file certifi-
cation on behalf of faculty members
and other staff people involved on
contracts.

To make a long story short. that
was simply found to be inadequate
by the federal auditors. And so that
resulted in the disclosure of the
situation nationwide which later
resulted in action in both Congress
and in the agencies to tighten up on
their rules regarding accountability.

In order to prevent that from hap-
pening again. they re-issued Circular
A-2|. providing for far more rigor-
ous accounting requirements in all

areas of research accounting.

lt has to change the way faculty do
business. One of the principal con-
cerns is that as a faculty member you
have to certify the percentage of
your time that you spend on certain
activities. such as instruction and
research. And faculty members are

understandably concerned. becaus{e@,.

if a faculty member is engaged in
teaching with a graduate student
and conducting experiments---what
is it‘? Is it teaching‘? Yes. ls it
research‘? Yes. Which is it‘? How do
you decide‘? And so there's some
concern.

Well. faculty members are simply
going to have to weigh that in the
balance. and we‘ll have to try to
develop some definitional rules.

So that's one of the concerns.

The other concern is simply the
more philosophic concern that this
is a silly requirement. Some faculty
members feel. because it’s bureau-
cratic. it doesn’t recognize how uni"
versities conduct research. and why
don’t we fight it‘?

Well. the fact is that we have
fought it. and we’ve lost. Every
major national organization of
higher education has fought this
thing tooth and nail. And we've lost.

a We haven‘t won yet. We may win

someday. but we haven’t won yet.
And in order to continue to qualify
for research grants. we have to have
the system up and operating by Jan.
l.

So. whether we like it or not. it is a
requirement. and we have no choice

about it. We‘re simply going to hzivg‘

to make the best of it.

lt may be onerous. it may be
bureaucratic. it may be foolish in
terms of the way one really allocates
one’s efforts in an educational set-
ting. But nevertheless. there's no
question about the authority.

Death, Love, Sex And Other
Required Pitt Courses

By GARY ALLEN

A recent investigation of the
University of Pittsburgh's course
description catalog has unco-
vered some strange and remarka-
ble courses being offered by
familiar and quite ordinary
departments.

One such course is found in the
anthropology department.
Titled “The Archaelogist Looks
at Death.” it takes a “look at the
wide range of burial practices in
the world" and includes among
its topics pyramids. tombs. bur-
ial mounds. graves. skeletons
and mummies.

Less macabre but nonetheless
extraordinary is the sociology
departments “Love in the Mod-
ern World." in which “special
attention is paid to...the difficul-
ties those in love encounter when
they try to integrate sexual love
into the intricate system of mod-
ern social ties.”

In the same department are
even more titillating courses like
“Sex and Evolution.”“Sex Roles
and Sex Status” and “Human
Reproduction and Sexuality.”

Those daunted by love and
death and desiring a more light-
hearted approach to life may
enroll in the Comparative Litera-

ture Program‘s “The Spirit of
Laughter.“ The course promises
to answer the eternal question.
“why do we laugh when Charlie
Chaplin slips on a banana peel or
loses his trousers?"Though some
may not consider this heavy
material. the course catalog
warns that “without it (laughter)
we could never get through a sin-
gle day."

Others feel the same way
about religion. and they. too.
have not been overlooked by the
university. From several depart-
ments ofthe College of Arts and
Sciences come such ethereal sub-
jects as "Evangelicalism in the
U.S.," “Religion in ‘Modern
America." “lnquisitions“ and
“Saints and Sinners Among
God's Ordained.” The latter
course explores why “some peo-
ple choose poverty. chastity and
obedience in pursuit of a reli-
gious calling.”

Not to be outdone by the
spirit. the body's interests are
catered to by the physical educa-
tion department. where a student

may. for example. study “Orien-T

teering. This unusual course
teaches students how to “read
maps. use a compass. move
quickly and safely through all
kinds of terrain and how to find
pleasure and excitement in the
outdoor world.”

Even such tried-and-true
school subjects as math. music.
social studies and languages are
not without their more exotic
sides at Pitt.

One course, “The Music of
China. Japan and Korea."
explores “some of the most
important musical genres ofeach
country: the Peking Opera and
the seven—string zither of China.
gagaku and noh drama ofjapan.
the p ’ansori and the ka_va/reum of
Korea.

Students possessing mathe-
matical minds will be fascinated
by some of the abstruse subjects
in the mathematics department.
Alluring titles like “Polymeriza-
tion Properties.” “Stochastic
Process" and “Discrete Mathe-
matical Structure ”entice the cur-
ious into the abstract world of
complex mathematical concepts.

Courses for and about women
also abound. Along with“Urban
Women“ there are “Working
Women.” ‘“l9th Century
Women." “Women in Film.”
“Women in Politics“ and
“Women in’ Law."

I IfSpanish is passe and French
a bore there lies hope in the
Slavic language and literature
department. Who would not be

Other uncommon courses
scattered among the more famil-
iar offerings at Pitt include “Sur-
vey of Para psychology." “Magic
and Magicians." “Scuba." “Afri-
can Liberation Movements"and
“After the Holocaust."

So. for the Pitt student who is
tired ofa meat-and-potatoescur-
riculum. the university has pro-
vided an ample sprinkling of
more exotic fare. adding spice to
what may have become an other-
wise bland academic diet.

Soundness ofLibrary Report Questioned

D By FREDERICK BEERS

Questions have been raised about
the soundness of some of the pro-
posals made by the Provost’s Task
Force on University Libraries.

Jerome Wells. chairman of the
Subcommittee on Academic Ser-'
vices. raised thequestions at a recent
meeting of the Senate Council. The
purpose of the criticisms. he points
out. is to provide “input tothe dis-
cussion process" of the proposals.

“Most questions are in thearea of
what must be centraliled. and what
need not be centralized for the auto-
mation. which we (the subcommit-
tee) believe is critical to the quality
of the libraries." Wells said in a
recent interview.

The points made by the subcom-
mittee include the following:

0 a decision on whether. and how.

to implement automation should,

precede the appointment ofa single
director:

0 some of the task force's propos-

als require more openness than the

_ administration has shown in the

"avast. as tor example with regard to

long term plans for specific pro-
grams:

.0 certain elements of the Task
Force’s recommendations. such as
reassignments. deserve more careful
consideration.

The subcommittee agrees with the

‘Task Force‘s proposals to increase

the acquisitions budget by 50 per-

cent over the next five years. to

develop a central computer catalog
of all university library holdings. to
recommend resource sharing among
the various libraries-. and to give the
right of access to the libraries to all
members of the university
community.

Wells said the issue as the sub-
committee presently sees it is that
there is clearly tension between
decentralized functions ~ those
where the user and the library per-
sonnel are in very close Contact and
where decisions are made on that
basis and centralized functions
where decisions have to be made at a
higher-level basis because you have
to consider the whole university

should be carefully weighed against
the benefits attributed to it— and the
cost of alternate proposals should
also be considered.

The preliminary report puts the
estimated cost of the new office at
S2()().()()() per year.

The subcommittee feels that reas-
signments and relocations involving
libraries or library services should be
“carefully considered." and the
appropriate user communities
should be fully consulted before
such changes are initiated.

They argue that "no estimate of

the impact" of such changes on cur-
rent operations had been made.

The subcommittee believes that
another course must be explored as
an al/‘ternative to ‘the Task Force’s
recommendations. They recom-
mend that decisions on automation
be made at the higher administrative

levels. and then an appropriate indi-‘

vidual be charged-— as a full time

They believe this alternative has

the merit of“centrali7ing theauthor-

Two Pitt students pleaded
guilty to a charge of disorderly
conduct and agreed to pay $207
each for throwing objects from a
lhth floor window of Tower A.

Delhart Dobbs and William
Kerr agreed to pay the restitution
costs to pedestrians they hit with
paint-filled Styrofoam cups
thrown from their windows. The
students were arrested by cam-
pus police on Nov. 3. They were
taken to the downtown police
station and were jailed before
being released on nominal bond.

Campus police Lieutenant
Walter Walters said the students
also threw phone books out the
window. He said‘ two people
were hit with the paint. but
neither was seriously injured.

"But objects being thrown
from the Towers is a real prob-
lem." Walters said. “We're wor-
ried to death about stuff coming
out of these windows. Someone
will be killed.”

One of the students told cam-
pus police officer Kenneth Grey-
son that he threw the objects out
of the window “for kicks.“

Greyson added. “What would

Professor Talks on Reaganomics

By LAWRENCE LEDERER

President Reagan may have one
of the largest deficit budgets since
post-war times, said Pitt economic
professor Richard Thorn.

Thorn. director of Pitt's economic
policy institute. spoke at an honors
program lecture Nov. 10.

Thorn said that Reagan’s admin-
istration believes in the basic philos-
ophy of economic liberalism. This
philosophy states the beliefthat men
are rational individuals; they know
their own best interests and thus
ought to be free to pursue them.
according to Thorn.

“These. though. are unproven
assumptions and thus is a major
problem with Reagan's theory." said
Thorn.

According to Thorn. Reagan
states that if the U.S. is going to
alleviate stagﬂation~—inﬂation com-
bined with unemployment-it n_i_ust'

encourage corporations to invest
more and encourage workers to be
more productive by giving them
financial incentives. such as lower
taxes.

“Yet. none of this has any empiri-
cal verification." he said.

Thorn questioned whether Rea-
gan can be sure that business will
react to his programs. He pointed
out that corporate investment is in
the worst shape of any sector in the
U.S. economy.

The No. I priority of Reaganom-
ics is to cut the role of government
drastically out ofthe lives ofindivid-
uals and corporations. said Thorn.

To get his program passed
through Congress. Reagan used two
arguments, according to Thorn. The
first argument was that by cutting
taxes. investment would be stimu-
lated. Secondly. Reagan said that.

would the Gross National Product.

Thorn said that Reagan wants to
convert federal programs into block
grants.

“This means that federal monies
will be given to the states. Each state
will then disperse the monies as it
sees fit." Thorn said.

Yet. Thorn said. problems result
from this decision because. ‘for
example. Pennsylvania will face an
increase in state taxes. and Pitts-
burghers will have an additional
increase in city taxes. Thorn. how-
ever. believes the decrease in federal
income tax will slightly overshadow
the increases in state and local taxes.

Thorn said that Reagan has a
choice. He can either reduce govern-
ment expansion drastically Or'
increase employment. He wilI~not be-
able to do both at the same time. said
Thorn.

Concerning curriculum reform.
l)el.uca said he was opposed to the
original proposed package becatise

it limits students’ ability to choose -

the classes they want. He said he
does agree with the proposed
requirements regarding writing and
quantitative reasoning.

The proposed reforms would
require students to take at least one
math course. submit required
amounts of writing in designated
courses outside the English depart-
ment. and either demonstrate profi-
ciency in a foreign language upon
entering Pitt or successfully com—'
plete two terms ofstudy of a foreign
language.

The proposals are currently being
discussed by the Faculty ofArts and
Sciences. The Student Government
Board has come out against the for-
eign language requirements. and has
stated it wants to have students
included on the implementation
committees.

Clarke said she disagrees with the
provisions that make the curriculum
stricter.

“Liberal arts students should
choose what they want to fulfill their
own curriculum." she said.

Coleman said he thinksthe idea of
curriculum reform is a good one
because of the emphasis on improv-
ing writing and mathematical skills.
He said however. it should not be
mandatory for students to take
classes that are not necessary for

their future.
Barber is the only candidate to
agree with the proposed foreign lan—

guage requirement. He is in favor of

the whole curriculum reform pack-
age and said that the language
requirement would serve to rcin~
force the idea behind the reform.

“This is the strongest single exam—
ple of how this (curricultim reform)
can benefit students.“ Barber said.

l)el.uea said that Pitt should keep
the foreign language standards that
it already has btit enforce them
better.

Clarke said that she personally
thinks everybody should have at
least two years of another language.
but she said the university should
not force it on people who are not
interested.

Coleman said students should not
be forced to take a second language
if they are not going to use it after
graduation.

Another issue of the cam taign is
the student activities fee and he way
it is distributed to ‘udent
organirations.

DeLu ‘a said the funds gent rated
from the student activities are dis-
tributed fairly. but he is disap-
pointed in the way some student
groups use the allocated money.

“I think many ofthe student activ-
ities are being held off campus and
that should change.“ l)el.uca said.
“The students should benefit from

the activ ities fee since they're paying
for it.“

Clarke also said that the fee is
allocated fairly but that it possibly is
being misused after it leaves the
board‘s hands.

“lf the students ha\cn‘t been using
it wisely. that is where the problem
is." Clarke said.

Coleman said that before that
question can be answered. a survey
has to be done to see where all the
board’s allocation is actually going.

Barber said the money is being
spent wisely but SUB should “learn
from their past experiences and use
it more imaginatively for the univer-
.sit_\ as a whole."

in relation to the activities fee. the
board‘s process of recogni/ing stu-
dent organi/ations also plays a key
part.

l)el.uca turned out to be the most
staunchly opposed to the current
recognition process.

“There should be strict guidelines
set up for the recognition process.
and there should be no exceptions
except in rare cases." Del.,uca said.

Del.uca said there are several stu-
dent groups who have the same
goals and objectives. People who
share the goals ofan existing group
should join it ratherthan form a new
group. in Del.uca's opinion.

He is also opposed to letting the
board recognize intercollegiate
sports. He said the athletic depart-

 

ment should recogni/c these groups.

Clarke said the recognition pro-
cess is a difficult issue because every
student has a right to have a group.

"Unless a group doesn't meet the
criteria or is doing something ille—
gal.“ Clarke said. “there isn‘t a real
way that SUB can’t recogni/e them."

Clarke pointed out. however. that
the recogition process will soon fall
under the_iurisdiction of the univer-
sity and therefore out ofthe board‘s
hands.

Coleman said that the groups who
have similar goals should merge as
much as possible.

"‘lt doesn't matter if they differ. as
long as they are striving forthe same
goals.“ Coleman said. ’

Barber is satisfied with the current
process but said that SOB should
build on it and work together with
the groups for the whole university.

“The SUB is in a prime position to
help groups get in touch with pro-
gressive action." he said.

Lack ofcommunication and coor-
dination between student organi/a~
tions seems to be one ofthe gaps that

all four candidates want to bridge if
they are elected.

Del.uca said that he would like to
see more communication among the
board. the standing committees. and
the student organizations. He also
wants the board members to be
more active with their standing com-
mittee liaisons. P

\
.\ \

 
 

"I expect the board members
know that their constituency is the
student body as a whole and not just
the group(s) that endorsed them."
l)el.uca said.

Clarke attacked the lack of com-
munication and placed some of the
blame on the board itself.

“The organi/ation is internally
split between the board and the com-
mittees. the board and the Sludﬁm
organi/ations. and the board and
the students themselves." shc Said-

She added that it is the responsi-
bility of the board members to go to
their liaisons and to be available to
answer any questions they might
have.

Coleman also said he wants to
bring SOB and the student com-
munity together. adding “there's too
much apathy at Pitt."

Barber also wants to improve
coordination and communication if
elected. but he also wants to make
the projects instituted by the
Governmental Relations Commit-
tee to be made available so students
can get involved with legislative
actions that will affect them.

Still
Searching

Well, we’re back to the drawing board in the
search for a design of the parking lot between
Carnegie and Hillman Libraries.

Which also means we’re back to parking prob-
lems and traffic congestion in the area that serves
museum and library patrons and Pitt students
and faculty. For that matter. we’re not really back
to anything--we’re just where we’ve always been
and probably will be for some time.

The fact that commuters still can’t find a park-
ing space and drivers simply passing through the
area have to dodge the ones who are looking fora
parking space, underscores the necessity that
something be done in the area before the situation
gets more critical than it already is.

Somehow, we felt slightly let down with the
news that the city was scrapping previous propos-
als to put in a two-tiered parking lot to replace the
current facility. lt’s not that we are disappointed-
they scrapped the idea of the two-tiered lot itself.
We held that idea with the same esteem that we
now hold the idea of a shopping mall in Forbes
Ouadrangle——pretty far-fetched. '

We are disappointed, however that there are
still no legitimate answers to the pressing prob-
lem of parking and traffic congestion in the Oak-
land area, and specifically that area between-the
libraries. "

Another thing which concerns us is the $ [(5,000
feasibility study. of which Pitt contributed"$i5,000
to, that determined the two-tiered idea would be
cost-prohibitive. Maybe someone should have
done a feasibility study on the feasibility study. to
determinejust how feasible it was to sink S l 6,000
into a study tht eventually proved nothing more
than the conclusion it would have cost a lot of
money to build the lot.

So, while the city, et. al., go back to the draw-
ing board to figure out a new traffic scheme for
the area, parking spaces are still impossible to
find between the hours of9 a.m. to 9 p.m., Mon-
day through Friday, students are still dodging
swiftly moving vehicles with no apparent success,
and no one seems to have any good ideas on how V
to help the situation. - A

We at Pitt have come to expect delays and let
downs;.the curriculum reform proposals are no
exception. But that doesn’t mean we particularly
accept or appreciate the delays. While we recog-
nize the university’s appropriat.ejudgem.ent in the
face of a cost-prohibitive proposal, we also recog-
nize the value of setting a deadline for finding
some solution to the parking and traffic problem.

Misuntandin 0 Faculty
Code Of Conduct Clarified

Dear Editor:

We believe there has been some
misunderstanding of our purpose
and actions in encouraging develop-
ment of codes of faculty conduct, as
reported in your article (Nov. 2) and
discussed in your editorial (Nov. 4).

In fact, we agree with you that
there need to be university-wide
standards. These already exist (and
do include hearing procedures) in

‘ the Academic Integrity Guidlines,

which perhaps can be strengthened.
The problem is that, to be applicable
in all schools of the university. such
standards must be very general. lt
was belived that there could be
stronger standards and greater
awareness of the standards if. in
addition, each unit was asked to
write its own more specific code.

Our committee had i been
requested by the provost to recom-
mend how to do this; we believed it
was a faculty responsibility to
respond to this request and assist in
the development of a climate that
encourages and rewards proper con-
duct. We do believe, however. that
discipline in cases of misconduct is
an administrative responsibility.
Thus. we accept the responsibility
that faculty misconduct is a faculty
problem, but we are certainly not
claiming that it is only a faculty
problem.

It should be noted the provost has
nor proposed any system to which
we are objecting; the proposals men-
tioned are ones that we and others
have given him. lt is we. for exam-

SPENCER DAVIS

Davis, a junior, said he wants
student government to form a
stronger working relationship
with the administration. He
added that SGB should work as
an agent to transfer information
from the administration to the
students.

Since SGB controls allocation
of the student activities fee, it
should watch how these funds
are being spent, Davis said.
Before an organization is allo-
cated funds. SGB should make
sure that the group is sound and
effective in its programs and
recruitment, according to Davis.

He is currently treasurer ofthe
lnter-Fraternity Council and
Greek Week charity chairman
for Phi Gamma Delta fraternity.

Davis is in favor ofthe curric-
ulum reform package and said it
will give students “a well-
rounded, liberal education.”The

-foreign language requirement,

however, should not be forced
on students, he said.

Davis said he has a good abil-
ity to work with people. He
noted that his past experience as
a member of SGB‘s Allocations
Committee was beneficial in

_ helping him deal with student ‘

problems.

 

 

 

JEFF DELMONTAGNE

Delmontagne, a junior, said
that heiis against the proposed
curriculum reform, because with
students already paying so much
tuition, they should be able to
pick the classes they want to
take.

Delmontagne was a member
of the Resident Student Associa-
tion and Pitt’s Governmental
Relations (now GRC) Commit-
tee.- He is also a member of Delta
Phi fraternity.

He says he does not think the
student activities fee is being
spent wisely because not enough
activities are offered to students.

“We spend a lot of money for

i’ very few services,” he said.

Delmontagne said there needs
to be more commuter»involve—
ment in student organizations
and activities. He noted that
commuters only had the student
union in which to get involved,
and now, with the renovations,
they have nothing. '

sificfation of students.
Although the student activi-
ties fee is being spent wisely,
according to Hausman, she said
she believes it is givenout a little
too freely to student groups. She
admitted, however, that it is
hard for the Allocations Com-
mittee to prove if a group is
maintaining its minimum
requirement of 25 members.

Hausman serves on the Com-
muter Affairs Committee and is
currently its chairman. She is
also the social chairman of
Sigma Delta Tau sororitv.

, Hausman said she is against
the proposed curriculum reform.
She doesn’t disagree with the
writing and mathematic require-
mints but believes the other
reforms, such as the foreign lan-
guage requiremint,should not be
forced on students. She said she
believes the reforms will hurt
departments like black studies
and religious studies.

PAM HOKE

The Pitt Program Council
“doesn’t have enough activities
unite the campus as a
whole," Pam Hoke said, She
said that there should be more
dances and concerts to involve
all Pitt students.

Hoke. ajunior, is president of
Circle K and a member of the
Governmental Relations Com-
mittee. She is also a member of
the Pre-Law Society.

Hoke said her main concern is
the lack of awareness of SGB
“exhibited by the majority of
Pitt students.” She said more
publicity is needed to promote a
greater involvement of the stu-
dent body.

She said she would like to
have more student group assem-
blies because “groups only go to
-SGB for allocations and nothing
else.”

Hoke said that she is in favor
of the foreign-language require-
ment that is proposed by the
faculty. P

She also said that she is op
posed to the proposed frater-
nity housing complex but did
not elaborate on the issue.

LINDA O‘CONNOR

The proposed foreign lan-
guage requirement would make
potential students react nega-
tively to Pitt and decrease uni-
versity enrollment, said SGB
candidate Linda O‘Connor. She
said that instead of implement-
ing new foreign language rules,
the university should enforce its

current standards.
()’Connor is a member of

SGB’s Governmental Relations
Committee and is the student
spokesman to the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences Council. She
said the main issue now concern-
ing the proposed curriculum
reform is getting studentson the
committee that would imple-
ment the reforms.The current

proposal allows only faculty.

members on the implementation
committees. -

O’Connor said that the stu-
dent activities fee is not being
spent wisely and that there is
waste in the way funds are allo-
cated to student groups.

“Even the student government
committees get more money
than they deserve,"she said.

A sophomore". O'Connor has
been involved in lobbying efforts
with the GRC and said she has a
general involvement with stu-
dent goverment. Shealso said
she knows the people “who are
important to get ideas across to."

GREG POWERS

Student organizations should
work together instead of work-
ing against each other. said Greg
Powers.  junior, Powers said

there needs to be a smoother sys-
tem developed between student
government and student organi-
zations.

Powers said that the student
activities fee is being spent wisely
and that the Allocations Com-
mittee is “doing as good as ajob '
as they can.”

Powers is homecoming chair-
man and on the pledge advisory
board for Pi Kappa Alpha fra- ,‘ ,,

The basics of the curriculum
reform package are commend- 
able and should help students
receive a wide span of education,
according to Powers.He said,
however, that it is unfair for Pitt
to require three years ofa foreign

language because many high

schools do not have the resour-
ces to accommodate the require-
ment. »

Powers said that politics are in
his future and that he would
work to meet the needs and

JOHN ROBOSSON

 

The proposed fraternity hous-  
ing complex will take the person-
ality out of fraternities,
according to SGB candidate
John Robosson, a junior politi-
cal science major.He opposes
construction of the complex and
would prefer that fraternities
stay in their present locations.

Robosson said that residents
of homes near the present frater-
nity houses were aware that their
neighbors would be fraternities
before they moved into the
neighborhood.

“lt’s not fair for the residents « ;
to have to put up with things.”  7‘
Robosson said. “But the frats
shouldn't be ousted (from their
present neighborhoods)."

Robosson is a member of
Theta Chi fraternity and has
been involved in Pitt‘s‘karate
and hockey clubs.

Robosson said that the gen-
eral outline of the curriculum
reform package is good and will
be symmetrical with that ofhigh
school programs. Although a
fo-reign language requirement
would help Pitt and the aca-
demic process, according to
Robosson. smaller high schools
would havea tough time meeting
the requirements, which would
be unfair to those students.

CHIP ROTH

, The Student Government
‘Board needs to put more pres-
sure on the university to keep
Pitt’s tuition low, according to
SGB candidate Chip Roth. He
said Pitt basically serves the
Western -Pennsylvania working
class and, if tuition continues to
rise, it will make Pitt no longer
accessible to everyone.

Roth, a junior, is currently
chairman of the Governmental
Relations Committee and presi-
dent of the Pennsylvania Stu-
dent Association for State-
Related Universities.

He said the original College of
Arts and Sciences curriculum

"\‘eform package was too restric-
tive but that he supports the
basic ideas ofthe reform. He said‘
students should have more input
into curriculum decisions and
that students should be permit-
ted on the curriculum implemen-
tation committee.

Roth believes allocation ofthe
student activities fee is “working
out well” once the money is dis-
tributed. but he said there is a
conflict of interest in the process
because the student government
allocates money for itself.

 One of Roth’s goals isto“look

 at the (CAS) advising center

with a critical eye." The advising
center needs to do a betterjob in
meeting student needs. Roth
said.

JEFF SCHAFFER

Students do not realize how
well the student activities fee is
being spent, according to sopho-
more Jeff Schaffer. The Student
Government Board blames this
lack of information on the fact
that many people do not know
what the board does. He said the
lines of communicaton between
SGB and the students should be
more open.

Schaffer is a member of the

’Resident Student Association,

and of Delta Tau Delta
fraternity.

Schaffer said he, agrees with
curriculum reform inthe College
of Arts and Sciences because it
“gives students a wider variety of
courses to choose from.” But he
does not agree with the foreign
language requirement.

“Foreign language will not
make students more knowledge-
able,” he said.

The implementation process
of curriculum reform is now the
main issue, he said, and students

need to be appointed to the com?

mittees that will put the reforms
into effect.

Schaffer said that a board
member should act as a liaison
between the SGB and student
groups. He said he also wants the
board members to be active and
involved with their standing
committees.

JAMES SHELTON

The current allocations pro-
cess is “too nebulous and the pol-
icy too ambiguous,” according

 

to James Shelton. He said the
funds should be spent on pro-
grams involving more students.

Shelton, ajunior, is a member
of the Allocations Comittee and
the Black Action Society. He is
also a member of Phi Eta Sigma
national freshman honor frater-
nity and Druid honoraries.

Shelton said he questions the
need for a curriculum,reform
and said that the debate looks
“like a battle between
departments.”

Shelton said there needs to be
greater enforcement of student
groups’ advertising so students
know where their money is
going. He said the activities fee is
being “wasted” on such things as
regional conferences for individ-
ual groups. He said the money
should instead be used for the
benefit of all Pitt students.

Shelton said that he feels the
current recognition process that
the SGB is a “good system” with
the groups getting partial and
then full recognition if they can
prove to the board that they have
met the criteria.

TOM SHERBONDY

Student organizations with

similar goals should combine
and form a single group, said
junior Tom Sherbondy, an SGB
candidate. He said that, out of
such a consolidated group, sub-
division should be created for
students who want to pursue a
different aspect of that activity.
Sherbondy cited as an exam-
ple, various karate clubs at Pitt
that could form one group with
different internal divisions.
Sherbondy was a member of
the Allocations Committee and
editor ofthe Freshman Register.
He is also a member of Phi
Gamma Delta fraternity._
Sherbondy said he is in favor
of the general education require-
ments in the proposed College of
Arts and Sciences curriculum
reform. but he is againstlthe for-
eign language requirement.
“It will be a financial burden
on the student who does not ful-
fill that requirement,” he said.

Sherbondy said that there
should be more students
involved in SGB and student

organizations as a whole.
Student government should
publicize activities so students
know what is happening in the
university, according to
Sherbondy. '

ROBBIE THE’

There is a need for more stu--

dent representation to the
administration, said Robbie
The’. The’ said that the adminis-
tration, ‘as well as student
government, need to have “a bet-
ter scope to what the feelings of
the students are.”

The’, a junior, is the past -
presTdent of the Resident Stu-
dent Association and is Pitt’s
representative for the National
College Co'ord‘inator. He is also
a member of the Student Affairs

‘Advisory Committee and the

University Senate.

The’ is in favor of the pro-
posed curriculum reform, and
said that students need a variety
of subjects to get a good back-
ground. He said that before any
changes are instituted, however,
the subject has to be examined
more thoroughly.

He wants to examine the Stu-
dent Health Center to make it
run better. He said many people
do not use the center and that the
purpose of the center has to be
examineelr

The’ also said that the SGB
should set up a central informa-
tion center where students could
get the information they need
about groups and classes.

 

REBECCA VERONIS

Pitt students have a lack of
awareness about what SGB

 

actually does, Rebecca Veronis
said. She said she thinks that
most people do not take the Stu-
dent Government Board
seriously.

Veronis, a sophomore, is a
member of the Mentor Program
and is a participant in the Hand-
in-Hand Festival.‘ She also sings
for the Heinz Chapel Choir.

Veronis said she is generally in
favor of the curricﬁlum reform,

but is not too “gung ho” about

the foreign language require-
ment. ‘‘I don’t think it’s right to
enforce a foreign language on
students if they don’t have any

affiliation with that language,” ‘

she said. -

She said the allocations pro-
cess is working well and that the

student activities fee is being

spent wisely.

Veronis said she wants to get
more student involvement in
SGB and student groups.

“Its true you can’t make ever-‘

ybody happy, but to try your

best couldn’t hurt,” Veronis said,

GREG WILSON

There needs to be greater com-
munication between the Student
Government Board and student
organizations, board candidate
Greg Wilson said. He ‘said that
board members should help
facilitatetthat communication by
helping student organizations
with membership recruitment.

Wilson, a sophomore, is Inter-
Fraternity Council representa-
tive and rush chairman for Pi
Kappa Alpha. He was a staff
writer for Showcase magazine
and is an ad display artist for The
Pitt News.

Wilson said the proposed cur-
riculum reform is “very good
and greatly needed,” Hesaid the
current standards do not encour-
age strong academic back-
ground. The candidate does not,
however, agree with the foreign
language requirement; he said
the university should institute a
good foreign culture study
instead.

“Foreign language does not
give the background that a for-
eign culture study does," Wilson
said.

Board members must work to
fulfill students‘ wants and needs
and must do more research into
student organizations. ‘ i

Recruiting Woes Sap Army

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

As ifthe promise offour lost years A

on a football field weren‘t enough of
a recruiting handicap. the U.S. Con-
gress long ago mandated another
one for the”"‘““Army Cadet football
program to battle.

The five-year military service
requirement—a mandatory sen-
tencethat all U.S. military academy
graduates must serve after gradua-
tion. The five-year span has been as
much a detriment to service acade-
mies football programs. like Army.
as the 30-95 scholarship rule has
been to anarchy at the top ofcollege
football. ,

The 30-95 rule limits colleges to
awarding 30 new scholarships per
year. and 95 total scholarships in
four years. lt‘s a rule that has elimi-
nated the big-time football schools
with big budgets from hoarding
players in the wings. often just to
prevent another team from landing
the prospect.

For. while the rest of college foot-
ball steadily approaches parity.
thanks to the 30-95 rule. head coach
Ed Cavanaugh and his Cadet team.
tomorrow's opponent for the top-
ranked Pitt Panthers. rely largely on
patriotism to snare football players.

And while the budding generals
keep coming to Army. the problem
has been they don‘t play football
very well. and the budding pro play-
ers have stayed away. lt‘s an untena-
ble situation for a coach's win
column which Cavanaugh well
realizes.

“The five-year committment after
graduation is the most difficult
problem we have. We can't get the
great athletes and we often have
trouble even getting the good ones."
Cavanaugh sighed. “All the great
athletes are thinking ahead to pro
ball--— that confidence is what makes

-them so good. But we have to sit

them down and tell them there's no
way they can do that here.”
Which leaves Cavanaugh
with...er. to borrow a phrase from
another khaki counterpart a few
good men. Toss in a few ihjuries to
some keyplayers. and one realizes
very quickly that Cavanaugh‘s army
enters Pitt Stadium tomorrow out-
manned. and a sure bet to be outma-
neuvercd, by Pitt by the afternoons
end. A ‘
Likely to miss tomorrow’s game
are two of Army’s top flight
players» tailback Gerald Walker
and cornerback Dale Love.
Walker. who has a pulled hip

muscle. was jogging earlier this
week. but Cavanaugh rated him
questionable for tomorrow‘s
encounter with Pitt. Walker. the
strongest» perhaps only- weapon
in Army’s offensive arsenal. so far
this year. has gained 999 yards. Last
season against Pitt. the 5-H. l92
poundjunior rambled for I25 yards.

Love. a three-year letterman for
the Cadets. has been out for much of
the season with a knee injury. The
junior had three interceptions last
year in Pitt’s 47-3 win.

Compounding Army’s problems
against Pitt are the Cadet offensive
and defensive linemen Pitt fields
some running backs who are bigger.
Army‘s defensive line averages an
anemic 225 pounds. compared to the
Pitt offensive line. which averages a
hefty 265 pounds. So much for the
“battle” of the trenches.

The toughest battle the Pitt team
will have to fight. again. is overcon-
fidence. Maybe we should say ditto
for Panther Head Coach .lacl.ie
Sherrill. who listed his top two goals
tommorrow—as. “keeping everbody
healthy and substituting more freely
than we have in the past.”

Looking back at Army’s past.

Lady Panthers Set
For Opening Meet

By JODY GIDLEY

Friday the l3th. usually a bad
luck omen. should prove to be the
exact opposite for the home debut of
the l98l-82 Lady Panther swim
team. along with the debut of first-
year Head Coach Dr. David
Belowich.

In their first confrontation ofthe
season. the Lady Panthers will host
Kent State University today at 3:30
p.m. at Trees Pool. Belowich sees
KSU as a very important meet
because it is the season opener.

“We want to do well in the first
meet and build from that. Our times
will get faster and faster as we get in
better condition and as the season
progresses. but we want to start out
as fast as possible.” Belowich said.

Belowich said he did not expect

any big problem from KSU. “They _

have a new coach and anew swim-
ming facility which they have not
adjusted to yet. Also. their coach
hasn‘t had the opportunity to estab-
lish the talent that I am fortunate to
have." he noted.

Belowich. who left his head
coaching job at the University of
South Florida to come to Pitt. re-
places l2—year head coach Dick
Bradshaw.

Belowich inherits one of the best.
if not THE top womens’swimming
program in the East. and his expec-
tations for his first season are high.

“Its a brand new season in which
I‘m concentrating on the present and

looking forward to the future. lt‘s ‘

nice to begin with the talent Dick left
behind." Belowich said.

With the return of seven All-
Americas. Belowich does have a
realm of talented swimmers return-
ing. Leading returning All—Americas
is senior three-time All-America
Amy Jackson. lf Jackson succeeds
in her quest for All-America honors
this season. she willjoin ex--Pitt foot-
ball stars Tony Dorsett and Hugh
Green and swimmers Kathy Stellcr
and Suzanne Pulley as Pitt's only
four-time All-America athletes.

Another returning All-America is
junior Jan Ujevieh. Ujevich is alsoa
potential four-year All—America
swimmer. barring any unforeseen
problems in her remaining. two
seasons.

Other swimmers returning with
prior All-America status are this
years co-captains. seniors Julie Ter-
rell and Nancy Henry. and seniors
Linda Frankenbach and Sandy
Taylor.

Sophomore Sue Heon is another
Lady Panther returning All-
America distinction. According to
Belowich. Heon is swimming
extremely well and he is expecting
big things from her this season.

In addition to the array of tal-
ented upper classmen. several fresh-
men recruits will add some depth to
this year‘s Lady Panther squad.

Laura Barber. a high school All-
America. is expected to become a
phenomenal backstroker. Valerie
Murphy will be counted on in sprint-
ing events. and Beth Hitchcock is
expected to excel in the middle-
distance freestyle events.

The high caliber of the Lady
Panther team should be tested as
they encounter a good. solid sche-
dule this season. featuring few weak
teams.

“We will be swimming the better
teams in the East and we’ve picked



up Tennessee. who is annually a {

powerhouse in the South. We also
swim traditional rival Michigan.

The scenario is one that is’

i played out at many high schools

and universities throughout the
country.

The scholastic football star is
recruited by a major football
power. He plays well in hisfour
years. but not well enough to be
drafted by the pros. Unfortu-
nately. he also fails to meet aca-
demic requirements after his four
years of eligibility, and leaves the
school without_a diploma. with-
out much of a future and quite
disenchanted.

There are those collegiate

‘football players who do graduate

and go on to procure success in
business or in pro football. but it
is those who fail that are the
target of Dr. Allen Sack, project
director of the three—month-old
Center for Athletes Rights and
Education in New York City.
“On the whole. playing colle-
giate football today is like trying
to play at the professional level
and. at the same time. be a stu-
dent. It is a very. very difficult
_ thing for a normal human being
to do." says Dr. Sack, whose

 

Pitt Athletic Director Cas
Myslinski calls the Athlete’s Bill
of Rights “a lot of baloney."

The bill of rights is sponsored
by the three—month-old Center
for Athlete‘s ‘Rights and’-Educa-
tion (CARE) in New York City.

The organization says 'it’s
interested in helping athletes
who don‘t make it in professional
sports and don‘t get their
degrees. according to Project
Director Dr. Allen Sack.

In rebuttal to the hill of rights‘

rather have designated as univer-
sity “employees”. Myslinski said
the ideas won‘t' stand up_.

“You can't set up.trust funds
for the athletes for the simple
reason that it would make them

dents not to become students.

controversial Athletes’ Bill of

sion that grants collegiate ath-
letes the right to a fair share of
the revenues generated by foot-
ball and other sports.

It was that provision that
brought national focus upon Dr.
Sack’s organization, and it‘s a

. provision he feels is improperly
interpreted.

“With this provision. we mean
for academic trust funds to be set
up for athletes-especially at
schools where the revenues are
very high," Dr. Sack says. “These
trust funds would not be avail-

four years, and would be ear-

tantly, finishing an undergradu-

Dr. Sack’s line of argument is
that if an athlete is attending a
university on a scholarship, he is
receiving compensation for ser-
vices rendered. Therefore. he
deserves other benefitsand com-

(AP)—-Ex-Pitt quarterback Rick

The Steelers needed backup help
because Cliff Stoudt broke his

Gazette Wednesday. ’“

“Very frankly. it was something I
hated to do. but the guy involved is a
very fine quarterback who will help
our team." he added.

Rutigliano said the Browns have
been “dodging bgllets“ by carrying
only Brian Sipe and Paul McDonald
as quarterbacks. So they grabbed
Trocano. who was drafted by the
Steelers in the llth round of this
year‘s draft.

“Sure it‘s difficult for him to leave
because the Steelers are a great
organization and he played college
ball there. lt’s tough for a young
player, but everything changes." the
Cleveland coach added.

The Steelers had placed_Trocano A

on the injured reserve list before the
season after he tore muscles in his
stomach. Every other National
Football League team had a chance
to claim him before the Steelers
could activate him.

“If they put me on waivers, I pray
to God I don’t get picked up,” Tro-

cano said Wednesday before Cleve- .

land put in a claim.

“It would be a cheap blow to the
Steelers for someone to pick me up
because nobody needs a quarter-
back right now.” he added. “I want
to live here. We come to love this
city.” ‘

The Steelers lost a similar gamble
last year and it cost the-m two play-
ers. They ' tried to activate Thom
Dornbrook and Rick Moser before
the Miami game.

But the Dolphins claimed both of

them and neither lasted this year.

The Steelers re-signed Moser
yesterday.

Moser fills the roster vacancy

created by the shift of quarterback

Stoudt to-the injured reserve list
with a fractured arm.

The4Steelers had hoped to put
Stoudt on injured reserve and aeti-

vate Trocano.

_ PITT’ NOTES: Phil Puzzuoli,
Dwight Collinsand John Hendrick
have been tabbed unlikely partici-
pants in the game. Jimbo Covert is
expected to return after sitting out
last week's Rutgers game...Cava-

F quarterback Bryan Allem for the

second straight game. Allem had
been sharing time with last year's
starter. Jerryl Bennett. a senior who
has been plagued by inconsistency
and interceptions this season.

 

"By AMIN GHOSSEIN

A pivotal weekend for college
football. With bowl bids soon to be
announced. teams with one or two
losses are looking to either upset or
impress bowl officials.

its also a pivotal weekend for my
picks. After a 3-5 showing two weeks
ago. a rest was needed. so my picks
weren‘t published last week. I can
tell you. however. that I went ll-0.

Without a ‘ doubt, this week’s

‘ major matchup isn’t Pitt—Army. The

Cadets boast offensive linemen in
the 220-pound range; high school-
size these days. Army could be the
worst team the Panthers play this
year.

After clearing out the cobwebs
last week, the Panthers should never
really be challenged. unless they turn
the ball over about I9 times.

The betting point-spread is 38. but
don’t take it. Pitt might win by more.
but 38 points is ridiculous. Look for
Julius Dawkins to break Dwight
Collins‘ one-year touchdown recep-
tion record of l0....Pitt 45, Army 0.

Alabama at Penn State: The big-
gest game on Saturday by far. A.
major bowl could go to the winner.
but the loser will be in a minor one.
Penn State, with Notre' Dame after
Alabama and Pitt in two weeks.
could still pull out_ a national
championship.

The Nittany Lions haven't looked
like champions the past two weeks,

    

.. . -.-:-..,§,._,-,_..._,._;'_ .. ,__.
however. One wonders whether the
great offensive line that everybody is
talking about is that good. With star
running back Curt Warner shelved..
the Lions‘ offense hasn‘t been awe-
inspiring. Warner’s status is ques-
tionableifor Saturday‘s game. and
without Warner. quarterback Todd
Blackledge and company have great
difficulty moving the ball.
It won’t get any help either against
a rugged Alabama defense. The
Crimson Tide will be awfully
pumped—up for a chance to get their
Coach Bear Bryant his record-tying
victory.

Alabama is getting four points;
take it. but take the Lions in a
rugged physical game....Penn State
l0, Alabama 7.

Rutgers at West Virginia: How
good are the WVU Montaineers?
Not very good is my suspicion. as
their 7-2 record has been the bene-
factor of Colorado State. Boston

College and Virginia. Get the pic-

ture‘? And you thought Pitt had an
easy schedule.

A minor bowl bid is waiting for
West Virginia. however. if they get
by Rutgers. They will, but notiby
much....West Virginia 24, Rutgers
20.

Auburn at Georgia: Auburn is
getting l3 points. take it. Auburn
isn’t bad at all this year. and after

their emotional win against Florida. r
Georgia will be down. Not down
enough though...Georgia 27.
Auburn 22.-

Arizona State at UCLA: A big
test for the Arirona Sun Devils.
Herc’s another team whose sharp
talent has gone unnoticed. The guess
is that they’re a lot better than peo-
ple think...Arizona State 34. UCLA
28.

Boston College at Syracuse: Poor
Joe Morris. The Syracuse chap is a
pretty decent runner. but he‘s on an
absolutely horrible team. Mean-
while. Boston College has the find of
the year in Doug Flutie. (Don’t say
that name around Pitt players.
they‘re liable to take your head off).
Flutie wasn‘t even on the depth chart
whenthe season started. Syracuse
will find out what it’s like to be
“Flutie-sized"....Boston College 41.
Syracuse 25.

Iowa at Wisconsin: Big game for
the Big Ten race. Wisconsin is tough
at home. so go with them in a good
game....Wisconsin 21. lowa l7.

Iowa State at Nebraska: This is
the bet ofthe week. No doubt about
it. take the lowa State Hawkeyes
and I9 points against the Nebraska
Cornhuskers. As a matter of fact.
bet on lowa State for an upset....
Iowa State 27. Nebraska I4.

Northwestern at Ohio State: So l
look like a genius. l’ll do this every
week until Northwestern wins.
Ready for this‘.’...Northwestern 3.
Ohio State 0.

I Students of ancient and contemporary historyare well aware of the sad truth about I
Turkey. More than 500 years have passed since the fall of Byzantium, on the ruins of whose 1 I
glorious civilization the Ottoman Empire rose and flourished. And for five. centuries,
wherever the Turkish sword ruled — from the Arab countries and Armenia to Greece, I
, Bulgaria. and as far as the ramparts of Vienna — it brought only terror and oppression, I
bloodshed and pillage. Depleting the physical and human resourcesof subject peoples, I
I seizing property and persecuting the people - these did» not seem»to assuage their savage
I appetite. They confiscated constantly and massacred mercilessly, young and old," men and
I women. Arab, Arme_n.ian~, Greek,i~Se.r~b,-:.Alb»anian, Bulgarian~;"-‘Rumanian and Jew, all‘ alike

I For all the 500 years, the Turk never contributed, nor made the slightest effort to arts,

I
subjects, the fruits of theirhard laborsearnedwith their sweat and life-blood, and give them II
in return the rewards of chains, suffering and death.  I
Our generation witnessed two terrible crimesof genocide. In one instance, the guilty
criminals - government and military leaders of Nazi Germany- were brought to trial before I
an international tribunal in Nuremberg, and punished with deathand imprisonment. The
_ survivors of the victims were given, as minimum compensation, not only financial restitu- »
tion, but also the restoration of Israel as theirhomeland. ,
In I9 I 5, the Turkish government conceived the frightful idea ofthe total extermination of
the Armenian, people, and implemented it through its military forces and the criminal
complicity of the people. More than a million and half Armenians, men,women and
I

children, were put to death; another 1,200,000 were deported to the deserts. Turkey’s hope

However, after the armistice of World War I, the victorious allies could not bring the
Turkishwar criminals to trial - among whom would perhaps be. Mustapha I(emal..'More
tragic still was the reluctance of the allies to decree just compensation for the unfortunate
victims of the “Blackest crime in history”, the Armenian people- who were denied their right
to the Armenia mapped by the great American president, Woodrow Wilson.

It will be argued, in all probability, that this commemoration is not intended to honor the
Turkish government or people, but is for Kemal Ataturk and therole he played as a reformer
and founder of a free republic. Although Kemal Ataturk and his regime adopted a few
external elementary reforms, history and the bones of hundreds of thousands of innocent
victims will bear witness that basically they continued the expansionist and genocidal
policies of the Young‘ Turks.

the protection of French forces, thoushans of Armenians were massacred and the survivors,
uprooted once again, fled to find refuge in Syria and Lebanon.

It was Kemal Ataturk who unleashed theTurkish hordes to invade Eastern Armenia and
occupy the provinces of Kars, Ardahan and Alexandropol, killing l00,000 Armenians.
Again, it was the same Kemal Ataturk who, in the disaster of Smyrna, was responsible for
the murders of thousands of Greeks, Jews and Armenians who were burned in the city or

‘ drowned in the sea. ' I

It was the “free” republic founded by Kemal Ataturk, which during the last war collabo-
rated with Hitler’s Germany, and tried to destroy Jewish, Greek and Armenian minorities
imposing fearful taxes on their properties and depriving them of their means of livelihood
and working privileges. And finally, on September 5th and 6th, l956,.a barbaric vandalism

athlete must be at his physical and
psychological best. The psy.ehologi-

his female swimmers is a method
that deals with imagery.

"Each swimmer creates their per-

this form of practicing in their own

Along with the imagery method.
Belowich has also devised a method
of relaxation training in which a
happy medium is sought between
performance and’ arousal levels.
Belowich uses relaxation training
after practices to dissipate fatigue
and also to prepare for meets to
ensure that peak performance levels
can be met prior to the event.

Turkey Trot Sunday; Lady Hoopsterschange Openers.

Turkey Trot Sunda)g....»

With Thanksgiving less than two
weeks away. the Pitt Intramural
office is providing some exercise
before the turkey is carved. The
second annual Turkey Trot will be

held this Sunday. Nov. 15.. starting

at Pitt Stadium at I0 a.m.

“When we started the race. we
awarded turkeys to the winners.”
said Marilyn Ross, director "of
intramurals. “Since there are more
races around. the race has become
more of a cross-country event. Now
the race is offered as a service to the
students."

The men‘s division will run 3.5
miles, while the women's division

runs a l.5 mile course. Unlike pre-

vious years. this year the winners
will be honored by having their
names published in the intramural

handbook.

For more information concerning
the race. call the Intramural office at
624-4398.

Snap... Crackle... Pop

Usingthe popular jingle of Kel-
logg's Rice Krispies, the Pitt sports
information office is pushing three
Pitt football players for All-America
honors.

In a four-color pamphlet. Pitt
Coach Jackie Sherrill says he would
not start a Saturday morning with-
out his snap (center Emil Boures)
crackle (tackle Jimbo Covert) and
POD (quarterback Dan Marino). The
front ofthepamphlet shows Sherrill
with a bowl ofcereal saying,“It’s the
All-American way to start your

day."
On the back, the virtues of the

three All-America candidates are
printed.

Schedule change...

There has been a change in the
Lady Panther basketball schedule.
Instead of opening against Point
Park. the Lady Panthers will begin
their season facing Fairmont State.
The game time and place is
unchanged; it’s still at Fitzgerald
