some druggists with prescriptions.

STATE TICKETS IS GREATEST ON RECORD

 

' Pitt had its. largest representation of alumni. rooters
at the annual game with “Old Penn” at Franklin Field

Saturday, no less than 1,000

boosters, made /up largely of

alumni, being in the Panther section of the stands to cheer
for. Captain Tom Davies and his team. It was a game

long to be remembered and

the alumni, who have made

* the trip to Philadelphia in the past, only to be disappoint-
ed by the Panthers not showing their usual form, were
delighted with the way, “Pop.” Wa1'ner’s proteges came

through, especially in the ﬁrst half. . The work of the var- »

sity_in that half was of the order shown in the Syracuse

contest and the bewildering

game they put up certainly

gave the alumni lots to talk about for many months to
~ come. I

Many of the “grads" came from":

' Eastern points, it being the only op-

portunity many of them have to see

i the Panthers perform. That is one of

the big_ advantages of a game at
Franklin ﬁeld. New York, Baltimore,
Washington and other Eastern cen-
ters sent‘ big quotas of Pittites, they
getting to the .Quaker City by train or
auto. Many got in the night before
the game and spent a pleasant time
chatting with the Pitt boys and the
Pittsburgh contingent at the Hotel
Rittenhouse, Pitt headquarters.
The Old Crowd There
Abig crowd of “grads” went down

. to Philadelphia from the Pittsburgh

district. Some traveled with the team
Thursday night and every train Fri-

-day, up to the last -one that night,

was packed with football enthusiasts.
The usual crowd of “Old Guard”
members, who never miss a football
game, whether it is played in Pitts-
burgh, Philadelphia or any place else,
was on hand--such standbys as Dr.
Walter Riddle, Pitt’s ﬁrst rooter; W.
C. Coffin, now of New York; Bert
Smyers, A-l Hamilton, Pat McParland,
Floyd Rose, and others. Mr. Coffin,
by the way, has eliminated his

._ moustache and looks all the younger

for it. He shook hands with all the
boys on the players’ bench before the
‘game started. ,

Everyone was delighted with the
Pitt band, which was voted one of the
best that ever appeared on historic

,Franklin ﬁeld. The boys were togged

out in their brand new overcoats, the
gift of the Athletic Council, and their
appearance and actions generally were
in keeping with one of the greatest
football aggregations in the country.
The band is certainly a great adver-
tising medium for Pitt,-—in fact, sec-
ond only to the football team. Alumni
who saw it for the first time and re-
‘called the old days when the boys
used to “chip in” 10 cents each to help
hire a band for the football games,

‘_were all the more delighted. When the

band marched out on the ﬁeld before
the game one of the “grads” sitting
near the writer remarked with enthu-
siasm, “That sure is some band-—

sort of makes you feel ‘goose ﬂeshy,’

doesn't it?” That was exactly the

, sensation the writer had.

After the game, the Rittenhduse
was a scene of much rejoicing and re-
unioning. All the Pittites were there
to -congratulate the team and to meet
fellow‘ Pittites.. It was a reunion’ of
the Eastern “grads,” the like ‘of which
we have never had——and which is pos-

. sible only in connection ‘with the big

Penn .f'o'otball game.
Three More Games
Three more big games remain on

’ Tthe Pitt schedule and all of them will

 

attract big. crowds of alumni. -Else-

desired as are available and Iiumer-
ous requests are being received to de-
viate from the rules laid down to the
Distributing Committee. This is ab-
solutely impossible and the rule of
TWO PER ALUMNUS must be ad-
hered to strictly. If one alumnus
would get more than two it would
simply mean that some other alum-
nus wouldn't get a single ticket for
these two big games.

The alumni orders are ﬁlled in sec-
tions 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 of the ﬁrst
ﬂoors and the entire section ﬂoor, in
addition to the boxes on all three
floors. The student orders for mem-
bers of the immediate family have
to be ﬁlled in sections 2, 4, 6, 8 and
10 of the first ﬂoor, which cuts down
the alumni allotment quite a lot. The
students are certainly entitled to this
privilege, however. Tickets for the
W. & J. game will be mailed Monday,
thousands of letters going out ,with
the precious pasteboards. They will
bring Pittites from all parts of the
United States for the big game No-
vember 12.

Won’t Forget Nebraska

The Nebraska game will not be
lost sight of in the excitement inci-
dent to the W. & J. and State games.
The husky Corn.-huskers, boasting of
the biggest team in gallegiate circles
this year, and fresh from an over-
whelmingrvictory over the University
of Oklahoma, will be a worthy op-
ponent of the Panthers at Forbes
Field Saturday. A big outpouring of
alumni will see the game, the demand
from this source being even larger
than for the Syracuse game——and that
set a new record. This is the ﬁrst
time a team has played Pitt which
represents the extreme middle West-
ern territory and it will be a big
event in Pittsburgh football history.
The game should certainly be one of

the best of theyear.

PITT ENGINEERS MEET
AT EIIIIT PITT IIIITEL NIIV. I5

At the annual engineering alumni
luncheon held at the Fort Pitt ‘hotel
la-st commencement week, it was pro‘-
posed that an organization of the
graduates and former students of
that school he formed, to be called
the Pitt Engineering club, its aims
and purposes to be similar to that of
the Yale Engineering club. A com-
mittee consisting of Graham Bright,
'97; Win. A. Bradshaw, '97; C. L.
Wooldridge, '97; W. D. Hockensmith,
’01; F. M. Roessing, ’0O; F. W. Hen-
rici, '05, and K. E. Davis, '10, was ap-
pointed to study the question and
take steps to effect a permanent 'or-
ganization.

This committee has had numerous
meetings and is now prepared to put
the proposition up to the general
alumni body of the engineering
school. For that purpose a luncheon,
followed by a short businesss session,
will be held at the Fort Pitt hotel
Tuesday noon, November 15. At that
time a Constitution will be ‘presented
for consideration and adoption and a
Committee on Nominations will pre-
sent , its recommendations for officers
and an Executive Committee to-serve
during the ﬁrst year. The latter part
of this week all engineering alumni
will’ receive -an official notice of the
meeting, with postal card enclosed so
they can advise if they will attend.
In addition they will receive a copy
of the proposed Constitution, so they
will be perfectly familiar with it and
be prepared to vote on it officially
at the meeting.

A large turnout is desired for this
luncheon and meeting. The business
session will not be lengthy and the
whole affair will provide another op-
portunity for the “grads” of the en-
gineering schoo‘l to get together and
become more closely allied. This or-
ganization meeting is the forerunner

 

alumni to be held under the Engineer-
ing club’s direction from time to time
“to advance the interests of engineer-
ing and engineering education at Pitt

and fellowship among Pitt engineers.”
If an engineering alumnus fails to
get a notice he should advise the
alumni office direct or F. W. Henrici,
the temporary secretary, ca-re Ameri-
can Bridge Company, Frick Building.

its decorations of leaves, fall roses,
prize pumpkins and beautifully col-

for a closely welded body of women

First, that he has only seen three
Pitt football games in the five years

located in the West, and, secondly and
most ’portant of all, that he is coming
on to see the W. & J. and State
games and between those games he is
to get married “to the best girl in

PITT SPIRIT MAIIES Iilli
’ , IIIT WITH ALUMNI

The fine spirit which permeated
the entire student body at the Syra-

cuse’ game has made a great hit with
the alumni and the‘Editor has heard
numerous complimentary ‘remarks in
this connection. The following letter
from a “grad."'speaks for itself.
Another very commendable thing
on the part of the Pitt undergraduates
was the splendid sportsmanship dis-
played toward Referee “Tiny" Max-
well. Tiny” may have pulled a boner
in his decision in the Lafayette game,
but it certainly wasn't intentional,

' and in the heat of a close game such

things are liable to crop up at any
time. Instead of razzing “Tiny" when
he came on the field to referee the
Syracuse game the inclination was to
give him a send off. Maxwell is a
square official and has always done
fine work in the Pitt games.

The “grad’s" letter follows:

“Was most agreeably surprised last
Saturday atthe spirit shown by the
students and especially the way every
last man stuck until the Alma Mater
had been played. The game was too
much to rehash on’ paper, but ‘the cus-
tom of playing our Alma Mater at
the end of each game has at last be-
come a reality. I felt prouder of my

.Alma Mater than I have in a long

time, and have already written to

men), who said Pitt had no spirit,
and for proof always said Pitt didn't
have enough spirit to do this one
thing. I sure made them take back
their statements in a‘ hurry and gosh.

stirred up the alumni last year com-
municating itself to the new Chan-
cellor and the undergrads, and the
guidance of a. real leader like Chan-
cellor Bowman, Pitt is going to startle
the whole world or I'm wrong.”

IIEIIIIIIE M’LAIIEN'S TEAM
MINTENDER FIIII TITLE

Word drifts to Pittsburgh from
Fayetteville, Ark., where the Univer-
sity of Arkansas, Icoached, by Dr.
George McLaren, Dent, '19, is located,
that the “Razorbacks,” as they are
called, are formidable contenders for
the Southwestern Collegiate football
title. Here is what a. story says,
under date of October 19:

“The excellent showing ‘made by
the ‘Razorbaicks’ in their 28-0 defeat
of the Ouachita. Tigers Saturday at
Little Rock has increased the belief
here that the Arkansas team will be
a formidable contender for South
western honors this year.

“So far, icoach McLaren’s eleven has
scored ninety-six points to its oppo-
nents’ nothing, and ‘the total ‘Razor-
back’ score might have been .much
greater had not McLaren sent in sub-'
stitutes during a. great part of the
games played. They ‘defeated Hen-
drix, 28-0 and Drury, 40-0.

“Two outstanding stars, both of
whom are practically certain to make
places on the first All-Southwestern
eleven this year, are VVinkleman,
right end, and Robinson, fullback.
Winkleman is playing the most bril-
liant -football ever seen on an Ar-
kansas gridiron.

“The games) played so far have been
in the nature of preliminary battles.
and the real fight for Southwestern
honors begins Saturday, when the
Arkansans meet Oklahoma A. & M.
at Stillwater."

McLaren is a deep student "of foot-
ball and that he is going real big
at Arkansas is only putting it mildly.
He likes the Southwest and South-
western people and was enthusiastic
in his praise of them while visiting"
in Pittsburgh last summer.

FOSTER IN ST. LOUIS

 

W. J. (Bill) Foster, Econ., '20, ex-
football manager, “Owl” manager,
and all-around Pitt live wire, writes
often to the alumni office from St._
Louis, where he is manager of that
city office of the Standard Statistics
‘Company, Inc—., 1106 Chemical Build-.
ing. “Bill" started with the Babson
Interests while in his !Senior year at
Pitt and gained the necessary exper-
ience ‘before he graduated to take 9.‘
position with that well known firm’s
St. Louis office. Later the opening,
developed with the Standard Statis-
tics Company interests and be shifted
to them. It is, of course, a well-

known fact that he is a. married man, , ’

and best of all, a “daddy.”

That “Bill” isn't losing sight of foot-
ball these days is shown by the fact
that he often sends clippings from the
St. Louis papers where they mention
Pitt team and players. We'll lay a‘
bet that when Foster turns to the
sports page of a St. Louis paper and
doesn't find mention of Pitt in it he
thinks the paper has been “scooped."
How about it, Vvilliam?

COURAGE

 

In the Saturday Evening Post of
recent date appeared the following
statements: “Courage is the product
of familiarity. Contempt of danger
is the reward of facing danger it is
but the sense of security afforded
by travel."

While we do not agree with the
entire thought of the paragraph yet

from. ‘

It is true that familiar things no
longer frighten us. Had the ancients
seen automobiles or aeroplanes they
would have sworn that the gods were
preparing to destroy them. Now,
however, because they are familiar
they cause no comment.

We do not believe, however, that
courage is contempt of danger, but
rather determination to go on in
spite of real or imagined danger.
Every sane man has at some time or
other been afraid. The «coward ran
from the cause of his fear; the brave
man fa.-ced it.

The coward is ashamed of his
weakness and endeavors to hide it.
Often shame will aﬁord the despera-

To win honors in any contest one
must practice. So in the struggle
cowardice and courage,
Search for ordeals. whereby to pro-
tect courage. Go to the mat with
fear. If cowardice tries to thwart
you in any matter, large or small,
accept the challenge.

Make a list of the things you are

to play football, or to punch the
nose of the bully who lords it over
you. When you have completed your
-list take them one by one and do
the things you are afraid to do. You
may break an arm playing football.
The bully may loosen your front
teeth. When it is all over, however,
you‘ will ﬁnd that imagination is a
liar and umworthy of your conﬁdence,

You are then well on the road to
acquiring courage. Practice the
method for a few days and ‘weeks
and you will ﬁnd that you have cour-
age to face any fear conﬁdently.
This is the mark of true courage.-~
The Gettysburgian.

GRAS-SELL IN CALIFORNIA

 

Warner H. Grassell, Ex. Ec., ’17,
who was in Pittsburgh last commence-
ment time, is now attending Sanford
University, California, the Federal
Board having awarded him vocational
training there. He writes, October 7:

“School opened October 1, and we
have had our first week of work. Dur-
ing the short time I have had here I
like Stanford very much. However,
I still have a. warm spot for Old Pitt
and am a‘ Pitt booster first, last and
all the time. The only trouble, at
least in my case, is that Pitt is in the
East instead of out here on the ‘Pa-
cific Coast.

“Received an awful shock last Sat-
urday when I heard that Lafayette
beat Pitt. How did it ever happen?
Stanford has a fair team this year,
-but I am afraid! won’t set the world on
fire. California, so far, seems to
have the edge on the other coast
teams. ‘

“Stanford is to open its new
stadium, which cost $500,000 and
seats 65,000 on November 19. Cali-
fornia is played in the big game of
season. Stanford and California like
each other like Pitt and W. &J. 3

“Please have the ‘Pitt Weekly’ sent
me, care Stanford University, Cali-
fornia, General Delivery.”

CRAIG IS FOLLOWING HIS
FORTUNES OF GRID TEAM

 

If Pittites ever happen. to be in
Washington, D. C., they want to be
sure to call on W. H. (Seeds) Craig,
Col., ’14, who is in Ward 59, VValter
Reed hospital. Craig was one of the
worst wounded soldiers in the World
War and has had a terrible siege of
it, but it has failed to break his fine
spirit one whit. The secretary keeps
up a. regular correspondence with him
and he is as keen in his interest of
Pitt affairs as in the days before the
war. Recently “Bob" Grove happened
to be in Wash.ington and he spent sev-
eral hours with him. .

Here is what Seeds said recently
in a. letter to the Editor:

“Your letter came a day too late
for me to be saved from an awful jolt
‘Bobby’
Grove had told me we would have a
winner and that the team was per-
haps as good as 1916. I. also had a

Bl‘-_'R6QU|ST- morn GUARD.‘ aux: --men-r TACKLE . DEWlTZ- HILL. er-\<.|<

telegram from ‘Bobiby’ giving me the
results of the West Virginia game.
Many thanks 'to him for it.”

Editor’s note~—This information is V

furnished by wire to Craig after each
game. -

“lf business at any time calls old
Pitt friends to Washington, don’t for-
get to tell them that I am at Ward
59 and always anxious to chat with
old pals.”

PITTITES IN HONOLULU

 

.Dr. J. W. Shuman, "10, of Sioux
City, Iowa, football, basketball and
track performer of years ago, sends
along this:

Greetings, Just back from Honolulu,
Where I visited Dr. R. W. Benz, Pitt,
’10: He’s doing great work. His
cousin, Dr. Benz, Pitt, ’20, is with
him. I stopped there two weeks. Also
stopped to visit my parents in Los
Angeles. Found my wife and three
kiddies well on my return.

“It was mighty tough that Pitt lost
to Lafayette. Dave Brown, old All-
American Lafayette end, ’01, is here
and plays golf every day with me.
He naturally kids the life out of me
now. But we'll get them later."

 

A FUTURE PITT GREAT!

 

Wilbur D. gl-Iockensimith, '01, old
time football player and coach some
20 years ago, is a proud “daddy”
these days. Young Wilbur Junior,
pride of his father's heart, is making

a strong bid for a regular end posi-
tion on the Norwin High team and,

‘according to a newspaper clipping.

which Wilbur Senior proudly exhib-
its, he has a good chance ‘to_ make a.
regular position. “Three different
players are trying f6r quarterback
and Hcckensmith seemed to have the
edge.” is the report of the paper.

The youngster, if he develops into
a football player, comes by it natur-
ally. “Dad" played for W. U. P., as
stated, and then his younger ‘brother,
Carl (better know as Dutch), was a
regular lineman and won his letter
for several years under Warner.

WETTAGH TEACHING IN SOUTH

 

R. H. (Bob) Wettaoh, Col., ’14, Law,
’17. is assistant professor in the Uni-
versity of North Carolina Law school,
his address being box 269 Chapel
Hill, N. C. “Bob” is anxious to get
his “Pitt Weekly” there andmade a
special request for it. He wrote earl
in October as follows: '

“It is very warm down here, like
our August weather and the football
squ.ad practices in track suits, except
during scrimmage work. I don’t ex-
pect to see the kind of football that
I have been used to in Pittsburgh, but
they should have some good games.
particularly on Thanksgiving with the
University’ of Virginia.”

CONTINUE THAT SPIRIT!

 

With each succeeding game this season the spirit shown by the
‘student body has improved. iBeginI_1,iI1g with the West Virginia
game and closing with the Syracuse "game a great change has taken
place in the cheering section at Forbes Field, so that these writers
and outsiderswho formerly ‘Vere condemning Pitt students, have

begun to praise them.

Butthis is not the time to let down. The three hardest games

of the season remain on the football schedule.

That with Nebraska

comes next Saturday, then with Washington & J eiferson College and
ﬁnally the co__ntest with Penn State. None of these games can be
considered easy. The members of the team do not regard them so.
There is no. reason for the students to talk of any of them as a

“sine ”_

In the three remaining games, especially those with W. & J.

and Penn State, student spirit will be needed more than ever inas-
 much asf-these are the two big home games of the season and these

schools, being located near Pittsburgh, will be able to bring a large
enough‘ group of students: to compete with our own cheering section.

The students will have to root better than ever.

On Thanksgiving

Day when at "least. 2,'000»State students are expected at the game,
we will need good cheering—-indeed, the best Pitt has ever shown at

Forbes Field. The game on that

day is sure to be one of the best

in the country. Let the rooting duel be the same. There is but one

thing for students to do:
at the remaining contests.

Continue the spirit of the Syracuse game

’DAVIS THEATER

Capacity _ audio-noes twice-a—day are
foreshadowed’ at the Davis Theatei
for the week beginning "next Monday
afternoon, ‘November 7, because for
twelve cotnsecutive performances the
all-headline Keith" vaudeville bill will

Eltinge, the world’s most celebrated
portrayer of feminine characters. Mr.
Elti*nege,' who is playing only a few
weeks’ in vaudeville prior to the - re-
sumption of his motion picture play
engagement, has tfnus far broken all
attendance records -in New York, Bos-
ton, Philadelphia and» Washington. As
the star of such successful musical
comledies ’ as  "‘The Fascinating
Widow,” “The Crinoline -Girl,” “Gou-
sin Lucy,” and several others, Mr. El-
tinge enjoys a vague second to no
contemporary’ artist. In the ﬁeld of
picture plays, he stands preetminently
alone. Vaudeville ’ lcnows him from
seasons past. Prior to his appear-
ances «in musaica1_-comedy, which be-
gan in 1911,-he was one of the most

of! the two-a-day.‘ He has chosen
for his Pittsburgh engagement, a

group of characterizations, each
diametrically opposite from the
others. In these antithesis, he will

reveal his wonderful versatility as
an in.-terprretor of girl types. A song
will he the medium through which
his characterizations will be convey-
ed.‘ In each of these, Mr. Eltinge
will wear a new sartorial cneation
which ‘will be the last word in
ferninine 

In the forthcoming week his asso-
ciates on the Keith program will in-
clude many notable artists. Among
then will be Bill Bailey and Lynn
Cowan with Estelle Davis, in “The
Little Production in One.” This was
written and staged by Mr. Cowan.
He and Mr. Bailey are the composers
at (‘Kisses’)? “Fan San,” “Pals,”
“Love,” “Secrets,” and a dozen other
notably successful songs. They are
also hanjoists extraordinary,

 

GRAND THEATER

 

Two feature photoplays are to be -
offered on the ‘big double bill which
will be pnesented -at the Million Dol-
lar Grand, Pittsburgh, all next week.
starting Monday morning November
7.2 ‘They will ‘be Harold Lloyd in his
latest three reel mirth-quake special,
“Niever Weaken,” and Thomas Meig- V
ham, P.itts‘burg1h’s favorite son, in his

Peter B. Kynels famous novel, “Cappy
Ricks.” The program will combine
in a great comedy week, Eﬂor the
Lloyd picture is original, wholesome
farce, and the Meighan offering is
comedy-drama with thrills, human in-
terest as well as uproarious laughs.

“Gappy Ricks” is.a thoroughly good
story, with broad sweep of plot, con-
taining a fund of '~ingenius ideas and
plenty of pop. It is a sea story. with
many of its ‘thrilling developments
transpiring out on the Paciﬁc, other
incidents taking pl-ace in San Fran-
cisco. Meighan has the role of Matt
Peas-ley, descemdient of ‘New England
Seamen, who lands in San Francisco
and ships as a mate on a large
freigthter. The head of tliie company
is Oappy Ricks, a former sea -dog.
The captain of the ship is killed and
Matt officers the ship safely -to a
nearby port. The company sends an
older captain to take the ship -back
to San Francisco, «and Matt, resent-
ing this, thrashes the new master and
maintains command himself. This
leads into developments of a their-
oughly delightful nature, ﬁlled'with
excitement and amusing qualities.
Pretty Agnes Ayres is the leading
woman and others in the cast will in-
clude Charles Abbe, Hugh Cameron,
John .Szainpolis,  Evienton, Eu-
genie WIOodward,"i‘om‘ 0’Ma.ll'ey, Ivan
Linow, William Wally, Jack Dillon’
and Gladys Granger. The adaptation.
was made by_A. S. LcVino, and Tom
Forman directed.

The most {original and hfilari-ous
situations in which the popular Lloyd
has eviezr appeared are presented in
“Never Weaken.” It is the kind of
photoplay thiat makes, the spectator.
Iaug‘-h. as Well as gasp oneself breath-
 The plot tieills of aybuth who

cides to commit suicide and changes
his mind when he ﬁnds -himself ac-

tial ground-work, which is quite true
to l-i.fe,- is ornamented in the style
of which Lloyd and his associates are
such masters. The story was writ-
ten by Hal .Roach and '-Sam Taylor,
and the comedian is supported by
Mlldlled Dravis, Roy Crooks, Mark
Jones and Charles Stevenson.

“AUTO" RIDE
TO PENN GAME

BY

 

. (Continued From Page One.)
that means. It meant more than a
half hour. The miners caused the de-

. lay. The boys from the hilltop were

congregated around one of the trucks
down in front of, the hut. The picture
takes place in front of Mellon Insti-
tue. Why were the miners holding on
to the truck? You see, there were

1 three trucks——-all big -Douglas trans-

ports. ‘It was decided by those in
charge of the trip that two trucks
would suffice. So one of three was
sent on its way. Two remained, of
course. One of the two was blessed
(or cursed as it afterwards proved to
be) with pneumatic tires. Now guess
which thuck the miners wanted? Cor-
rect! Let there be no misunderstand-
ing of the situation wherein the min-
ers: were centered. Everyone wanted
in the truck with the inﬂated tires.
That was natural’. But here’s the

“oath: There were more miners than

there were men from any other indi-
vidual sch'o'ol and the mine students
wanted to be together for reasons
best known to the miners. ,

The 66 were assigned ‘to the two‘
trucks according to the order in
which they registered for the trip,
with this exception: When the name
of ,'a college, economics or dent was

read" as "being -assigned to the pneu-

matic-tired truck that man was side-
tracked to Truck No. 1 (solid tires)
and a miner given his place in Truck

‘ No. 2 (soft tires). This system, at

first, didn't particularly appeal‘ to the
unfortunates who were. doomed, they
thought, to ride a rough and rocky
road, but at last the din of confusion
subsided and they were off. Inasmuch
as the Mine School contingent was
not large enough to ﬁll Truck No. 2
to its quota, about ten ‘others were
transferred. from the overcrowded
lead truck to the lighter machine. As
mentioned before, they’re off! The
battle’s on!

Did you ever visit the Heinz pickle
factory? You _saw the girls packing
pickles into the peculiar-shaped bot-
tles? Well, some wise crack in Truck
_No. 1 came into a bright idea where-
by all the ‘men could be seated with-
out the necessity of anyone standing.
When the two-truck train passed into

' Fifth Avenue from «Thackery the ar-

rangement of legs and arms was any-
thing but what could be desired. Those
who were ﬁrst into the truck placed
themselves comfortably upon the hay
and by the time twenty souls entered
therein the “standing room only” sig-
nal was waved. The seating system
was installed then, unanimously, and
four rows were formed. The first man
in the row had his back against the
front cab and between his out-
stretched legs was seated another
pickle and so on‘, the length of the
truck body. The system worked won-
ders-—for about 20 minutes, until
someone in Section 3, Row E, decided

I ' that he would like to move an inch or

so.‘ In order that he might move all
those who were sitting on him had to
erect themselves partially. Then
someone else got an itch and in less
than an hour the condition of Truck
No. 1 was pitiful. The men in Truck
No. 2 intended to install the new-
fangled seating idea if it was suc-
cessful in the mother truck. No. 2 re-
frained from attempting the plan. In
both trucks. then. there were men

’sitting and men standing. Each truck

worked two shifts, which shifted oc-

casionally. Compared to stealing sev-

eral winks of sleep in those two
trucks sleeping on a park bench all
night is heaven. -

At-1 a. m. in the morning of the
second day (Friday) the little train
whistled into Greensburg for tea. Tea
was poured in the only Greensburg
beanery that “lost the key.” The driv-
ers kept to the highway the entire
360 miles. The machines made good
time-going down hill. On ‘the up-
grade the big trucks did no , better
than the average 3-ton chassis.

Friday was a. beautiful day——-all
day. The eight wheels were safely
past‘ the gateway to the mountains,
Ligonier, and well into the Coal
Ridge. The fall foliage of variated
shades from rainbow yellow to blood
red, presented a singularly pictur-
esque study of October beauty. To the
observing the nature study oﬂ'ered by
the -truck ride was inspiring, even
more so than could have been ab-
sorbed from the window of a fast-
moving train. The village of McCon-
nellsburg was snugly nestled into the
heart of this Indian summer regalia.
From the top of the overlooking

" mountain the highway winded gently

through the valley settlement "only to
be traced far and high back of the
adjoining hills. At McConnellsburg
Truck No. 1 stopped. The word had
been received from a passing tourist

‘ that a stranded p-arty of Pitt students

were hunting for a lost bearing—or
maybe it was burnt. Something was
wrong with the truck, that was sure.

What could be sweeter! The “I

l'Told Ya‘ So’s” were recalled to life.
>The miners were stranded!

_ It took
more than a little discussion to con-

‘ .. Vince the mother party that inas-

much as one of her children was in
distress, the proper and kindly move

 to make would be a move backward——
' I to‘ rescue and tow the unfortunates to

a garage and a restaurant. And the

 brotherly love stunt was enacted.
 " “Truck No. 1 went to rescue Truck No.
 2. Ah, ha! The plot thickens!

Pitt hit McConnellsburg hard. On

 one occasion the "police force was

inspiring, but nevertheless it was

yond immediate repair) rolled

Mr. Douglas and another party of
Pittsburgh motorists took men from
the truck B into their ,cars and once
more “those who stuck” settled down
for another night hay ride. The
nights were bitter cold and those who
were unprepared shared blankets and
coats with the others. The next morn-
ing dawned with more than one‘ Pitts-
burgh fellow (feeling like the old ap-
ple core that was in the kitchen sink
over night.’

The Hotel Rittenhouse, private bath
with hot and cold, etc., where a morn-
ing paper is left at each guest room,
was Pitt headquarters. The party in
the big red truck was on Chestnut
Street Saturday morning at 10
o'clock, terminating a ride of more
than 37 hours. The quietude of the
Quaker Town was interrupted fre-,
quently by groups.of Pitt boosters.

The story at Franklin ﬁeld you
know. The truck ride was the talk of
the sporting writers in the press box
and several Philly paper related the
ride of -the 66.' The return trip was
not so eventful as the first three days.
However, it did contain several inci-
dents of_note. At Grandview Moun-
tain, west of Bedford, the early morn-
ing fog was so dense that on several
occasions the truck was driven dan-
gerously close to the embankment at
the edge of the road. — The driver
could not see the road in front of
him. Four machines, including two
trucks, met disaster in the smoky
haze. Mr. Douglass trailed the lone
truck to Chambersburg, where the
disabled machine had been driven
after being repaired at McC'o‘n:ie1ls-
burg. -

Not all of the original 66 returned
by the Lincoln Highway. When the
pneumatic-tired truck was brought
into play on the return the men were
made comfortable for the first time,
but even with this addition another
discomfort presented itself. During
the night and early morning of the
last day rain interrupted the sleep of
the Pitt crusaders. The trucks had
been rigged of the tarpaulin cover-
ing early in the voyage, but what did
the 66 care about rain? Pitt won.
That was all important.

beyond the" Penn goal line. First,
Anderson gained ﬁve yards at left
end; then Davies was good for four
at the opposite end. Hewitt, in his
turn«._. calrrried the ball; to mi*dﬁle=1»d'.-
Anderson gave Pitt another first down
by making a ten yard left end run.
Refleree 0’Brien put the ball 15 yards
nearler the Penn goal line when he
detected one of th -Penn players hold-
ing one of our athletes. Davies
gain-ed a yard at right end. Not be-
ing .s-atisﬁed with a single yard gain
by a man of Davies’ calibre, Holleran
decided to let him have the ball again.
This time Davies too-k the ball on a
double pass play to the 14-yard line.

Daviles gained twelve more yards

through tackle, but the referee dis-
allowed the gain for the reason that
the play had begun before he had
blown his whistle. Hewitt, however,
got back that dozen in two plays
through the line. It was now first
down on the Penn two yard mark. It
required two more plays for Davies
to score the ﬁrs-t touchdown of the
game. He scored also this: seventh
point of the game.
_ The second touchdown was scored
in the almost same manner as the
ﬁrst. It was the result of another
steady march toward the goal after
the kickoff had been received. From
the 30-yard line, the ball, was car-
ried down to the Penn 20-yard line
by means of a -well divle-rsiﬁed at-
tack. Holleran sent each of the other
three members of the backﬁeld
through every possible part of the
Penn line. From the 20-yard line,
Holleran threw «a forward pass to
Davies, who was downed .on tllle. six

down. Davies again kicked goal.

Penn elected to again kick off to
Pitt. When Davdes punted from the
34-yard line over ﬁhue goal line, which
gave Pen-n the ball on her 20-yard
mark, the Red and Blue team was in
possession of the sphlerroid for the
ﬁlrst time since the game began.‘

Penn, ‘for «a while, displayed a
strong offen-s-e. In three plays it car-
ried tble ball el-even yards. But on
the next play Stein tackled the quar-
’terback Wray for a ﬁve yard loss.
Wray then punted to Davies, who
was downed on his 40-yard line, from
which place Pitt proceeded to com-
plete th-e unﬁnished work, namely,
the scoring of the third touchdown.
They were temporarily interrupted
by a ﬁvve yard loss, a 15-yard penalty

‘Charles’ V. Vickrey’s summary of
the activities of the Near East Re-
lief shows the disbursement of over

$60,000,000 in -cash and sutpplies con--

tributed by the American people to
the salvaging of the Christian popu-
lations of the Near East. “The work
must be continued,” Mr. Vilckrey,
Says, "else how can the -unfortunate
people regain their feet to help
themselves.”

Mr. Vickreyls report states approx-
imately‘-2,‘790,000 Armenians are still
living in the Near East. out of a
pre-war population of more than
4,000,000 and es.tima;es llitd it not
been for‘ the aid given by the Amer-
ican people through the Near East
Relief, half of those now living
would have perished. ,Food was fur-
nished to 561.970 homeless refugees
dluring--a ‘large -part of 1920 while
300,000 pounds of clothing sent out
from the United States was dis-
tributed to barefoot and rag-clad
wanderers, all the way from the
Mediterranean to the "
mountains. ,

-Commenting on these ﬁgures Mr.
Vickrey continues:

“The tremendous task undertaken
by the American people in saving
the children of ‘-the Near East is one
which cannot be left unﬁnished. We
have an investment of over $60,000,-
000 in human life that America has
saved. If we fail or pause now, that
investment is imperiled, or may even
be lost altogether. Most of the
children we have saved from death
are still too little to take care of
themselve-s and conditions through-
out the Near East still are too un-
certain to let their elders. shift for
themselves. It is- morally sure that
for at least ﬁve years, the American
people who have rescued them must
see them through.

“It is the purpose of the Near
East Relief to do just this.”

This, appeal directed to every
American man, woman and child, is
being well received in Pittsburgh as
it has been in the -‘past. .

For the students, the Y. M. C. A.
will be the receiving station. For
school children and others the pub-
lie and private schools. of the city
will receive contributions. Head-
quarters of the Near East Relief in
Pittsburgh, in charge of the Rev. J.

The following article from Syra-
cuse, N. Y , after the Orange’s dis-
astrous defeat here ten days ago, is
interesting even if ridiculous. To
claim that Herb Stein or any other
opposing player had obtained ‘Syra-
cuse’s signals (it could only «be by
treachery on the part of a member
of that team) is nothing short of
folly. There is not one chance in
ten thousand nowadays of a, team's
signals being stolen; an-d.~.as.;ar matter
0: fasot, ilerb Stein had no more of
an idea what =Syz'acuse’s, signals
were than they had of Pitt's.

The article, however, is certainly
a. mighty big «boost for Stein. When
someone has to go to such extremes
as in the present case, to account
for "Hex-b‘s great. playing. his work-
must have been nothing short of
miraculous. Whoever wrote this ar-
ticle ‘surely was not particularly fa-

'mil_iar with Herbs work ‘in the pas-t

or they would have known that his
greatness is in large measure due to
his uncanny ability to diagnose the
opposing team-’s plays. As a diagnos-
tician we doubt if Herb Stein ever
had a. suipverior. Certainly those who
saw the Syracuse game ‘will stand
by that claim. The article in ques
tion follows:

‘fsyrwcuse, N. Y.—-—W'hile no alibis
are being advanced, therevis a story
going the rounds of the fans-vwho
saw the game Saturday, and the
players that Herb Stein, Pittus‘bnrgh’s
star center, was aware of the Syra-
cuse University signals. A majority
of them really believe it especially
‘after seeing how he played Satur-
day. They say .-wheneveir a signal
was called, Stein would shift and go
to the place where the ‘play was to
go. And he very seldom made a
mistake in picking the point where
the Syracuse backs were to be sent.

“Besides: this, Stein told other Pitt

the line and Whenever he sent. them,
it happened that the play went there.
This is one of the reasons which
many believe enabled him to break
up the Syracuse attack as he did
and smear most of (the plays.”

The Syracuse athletic authorities

this article and. have also branded it
ridiculous.
