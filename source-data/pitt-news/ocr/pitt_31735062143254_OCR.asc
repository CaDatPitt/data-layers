The WSGA activities committee, un- ,
der the chairmanship of Ruth Bowsex-,It
Ed, ’34, met VVednesday afternoon,-
3:30 o’clock, in Heinz House, to or-
ganize its spring program. The activ-
ities committee, which consists of
Ruth Bowser, Ed. ’34, Orpha Leighty,
Col. '35, Mary Blackburn, Col. '33,;
Eleanor Brankstone, Col. ’34, Thelma}

Yetter, Ed. ’33, Ethel Silverblatt, Col, 

'34, and Margaret Klein, Ed. '33. su-
pervises all women's campus activi-
ties.

“The committee will work,” said
Ruth Bowser, at the meeting “not to
carry out a traditional program, but
to study the system in use last year,
and in previous years, and to make
changesdeemed -necessary for the
best interests of women in activities.”
Research will be carried on by sub-
committees in last year's system of
freshman introduction to activities,
the point-scale system, and last year's
Leader’s Institute.

Orpha Leighty, Col, ’34, and Thelma
Yetter. Ed. '33, will test the eﬁiciency
of freshman unit groups. The unit
groups were an innovation of last
year’s activities committee. Fresh-
man women were 11ot allowed to en-
ter campus activities, but entered al-
junior group of the particular activity
in which they were interested. The
juniors groups were trained for en-
trance into the campus activity by a
representative from that activity.
The committee reasoned that besides
training the women, the new system
would keep them from overloading
their schedules while still unorien-
‘rated to the University. The present
committee will test that system by
checking the number of sophomores
w.l1o.have continued in the activity for .
which they were trained as freshmen.

According to tl1e chairman, there
has been much discussion that activi-
ties have an adverse effect on scho-
lastic standing. Eleanor Brankstone,
(‘.01. '34, will conduct a survey of the
standing of all women who are carry-
ing a large number of activity points,
to determine the truth of this asser-
tion.

The administration has agreed to
grant women two full days’ excuse,
from classes to attend the Leader's;
Institute, sponsored by the activities

Tilt With Chain Gang Skit}

 

“Sing Sing, Sing Sing.

Interfraternity sing——sing,

V\'e can't sing but we gotta sing

At the interfraternity Sing.”

Chanting mournfully, in convict
garb even to balls and chains, eight
members of Kappa Kappa Gamma
w-on the interfraternity song contest
with their presentation of “A Sing-
Sing Chain Gang: Panhellenic Ver-
sion.”

Indians, Egyptian mummies and
dancing girls. tintype girls, girls from
the north, south, east, and west ex-
tolled the virtues of the fraternities
they represented with plausible and
1ess-plausible tales of their origins, as
sixteen women's fraternities vied for
the bronze cup ﬁnally awarded to the
Kappas at the annual Interfraternity

Sing, sponsored by President's Coun-
cil, in the Heinz House Monday night.

Despite the depressing dirge offered
by the winners, the contest was the
most lively interfraternity sing ever
held at Pitt, according to Dr, Lotte
Lohstoeter, w11o presided. Presenta-
tions varied from extremely informal
skits and Indian costumes ingenious-
ly fashioned from potato sacks to
serious songs and formal evening
dress.

The judges were, in addition to Dr.
Lohstoeter, Mrs. Robert D. Ayres, di-
rector of the VVomen’s Glee Club, and
Miss Helen P. Rush, assistant to the
dean of women. The decision was
made on the basis of group spirit,
presentation, musical quality, and
originality of music.

By JACK BUNKER

Back in 1918 when all the adven-
turous young blades of the town were
being ﬁtted, or ill ﬁtted, in khaki, and
were awaiting the start for France
there was a popular song, a song that
went like this: “Oh, where do we go
from here, boys, where do we go from
here?” A few months from now, and
fourteen years from '18, it will be
sung again, but this time by a few
hundred Pitt seniors wondering if

graduation was such good luck after}

all.

George T. Ladd, president of the
United Engineering and Foundry
Company, is interested in that ques-
tion, too. He asked, “What are the
engineers, business men, doctors, den-
tists, and teachers graduating at Pitt
this year going to do?” The answer
being obvious, he continued, “Evident-
ly there are no jobs for all of them;
work is scarce enough for the people
who are employed. I often wonder
why American university and college
students have never thought, as Euro-
peans do, of preparing for the great-

est job in our country today. I mean
government.” -
“This depression,” he said, “is

waking the people to the evils of
proﬁteers, partisans, and politicians
at the head of our public affairs. Con-
ditions must be remedied by the peo-
ple and, when they are, the properly
triiined college man and woman will
step in .to -direct the destinies of the

states in a way that is in keeping

Frosh Dance
Head Named

Council Selects Meachem
From 13 Petitioners.

Of thirteen candidates, including
two women, for the position of chair-
man of the Freshman Dance sched-
uled for March 3, Emil K. Meachem,
Bus. Ad_, of Warren, Pa., was ﬁnally
selected for the job by Student Coun-
cil at its meeting Tuesday night.

Meachem, a member of the adver-
tising staff of the Pitt Panther, a
pledge of Delta Tau Delta fraternity,
and a freshman representative on the
Beauty Contest Committee affiliated
with the Owl, was ﬁnally decided upon
by Council after a preliminary prefer-
ence ballot in which he and Charles
Perrine, Bus. Ad. won nominations.
The ﬁnal ballot favored Meachem.

Each of the thirteen who sought
the position was required to present
a petition signed by 25 freshmen, and

also a letter stating why the job was
wanted.

Meachem was chosen over the fol-
lowing petitioners: Margaret Lewis,
Col.; Mary Ann Praegner, Co1.; Frank-

lin Brubaker, Eng. ; Charles Ruch,
Col.; Charles Perrine, Bus. Ad.;

Panhel Announces Dates
For Spring Rushing, Ball

Spring rushing dates for women’s
fraternities have been set for Febru-
ary 23,24, and 25, according to an an-
nouncement made at the Panhellenic
Council meeting last night by Jane
Stover, Ed. '34, rushing rules chair-
man. Mary Garber, Panhellenic presi-
dent, recommended that the practice
of rushing freshman women at lunch
be discontinued, since it discourages
freshmen from attending university
assemblies scheduled during ﬁfth-

Ethel Silverblatt, Col. '34, publicity
chairman of Panhellenic Council and
editor of O Philos, the Panhellenic
handbook, has announced that the
handbook will appear a week before
rushing and wil be distributed to
the freshmen at the annual Freshman
Education assembly.

Lois Boggs, Ed, ’33, social chairman,
has announced April 21 as the date
for the annual Panhellenic Ball, gala
affair of the women’s interfraternity
program.

Library Opens

To aid students having refer-
ence or research work to be com-
pleted before the mid-semester
examination period, the Univer-
sity Library has announced an
extension"of‘its opening hours to
include Sunday of this week and
next. The Library will be open
from 2 to 5 o'clock on the after-
noons of these two days, it was
announced yesterday by Mr. J.

Howard Dice. librarian.

with the enlightenment of the twen-
tieth century.”
Mr. Ladd believes that universities

and colleges should have schools of

government just as they have schools
of medicine or law and should awara
degrees to men and women interested
in entering any of the thousands of
positions as executives in our city,
state, and national governments.

Speaking of technocracy, Mr. Ladd
said, “Technocracy is exceedingly im-
practical, It is only communism
clothed in the guise of a. technical-
sounding word. Even Russia, upon
whom the world is how focusing its
attention to praise or disclaim the
merits of socialism-communism, is be-
coming more capitalistic every day.
They are raising wages, realizing that
their great lack is proper incentive
for the worker, Incentive, you know,
is a basic principle of our own sys-
tem.” _

As to unemployment, Mr. Ladd be-
lieves that industry is realizing that
its welfare depends on the economical
independence of the worker and that
the two will in the future mutually
solve their troubles satisfactorily. He
also believes that our country leads
the world today because of its ad-
vancement in science and that science
will continue its strides in industry,
making work even as it displaces it.

Lastly, Mr. Ladd offered an ex-
planation of our economic troubles,
an explanation that is being accepted
more and more every day. He thinks
that the ‘World War is the direct and
major cause of our p-resent condition.
To substantiate this, he said, “It was
a world-wide war, when everyone
speculated, inﬂated, and expanded
without rhyme. or reason. Conse-
quently, it must bring in its wake a
world-wide slump.”

Figure It: Out:

The Yuletide Festival cost Stu-
dent Council $212.94, it was report-

The Yuletide dance, with a total
income of $324 and expenses of
$428.08, showed a loss of $104.08, ’
it was reported.

Expenses for the play which
preceded the dance were $108.86.
Total receipts for both were $624,
including the appropriation from

Extend Early
Registration

Capacity Crowds Indicate
New System's Success

   

 

   

Capacity crowds engaged in ad-
vance registration activity Tuesday
and VVednesday caused extension of
the advance registration p-eriod, ac-
cording to an announcement this
morning by John G. Quick, registrar
of the University, Mr, Quick an-
nounced that students will be given
opportunity to complete registration
for the second semester in the period
between today and the semester’s ﬁnal
examinations.

The overﬂowing crowd which
jammed Room 3, State Hall, on Tues-
day set a new high mark for daily
registration totals. Three hundred
sixty-ﬁve students completed their
registration that day as compared to
272 for last year's highwater mark.

The unusually successful advance
registration period showed an enroll-
ment total of 2,303 students during a.
period of 1.2 days, a 45 p-er cent in-
crease over the total enrolled at the
same time last year. The oﬂices of
the registrar are enthusiastic over the
success of the system which, in its
second year of existence, has shown
to be of exceptional efficiency and ad-
vantageous to students.

“Because of increased interest in
the new method of registration and
especially because of the large num-
bers reporting on the last days of the
period originally stipulated, it has be-
come necessary to extend the period
for the convenience of the student. It
is for the convenience of the student
body that this new system was orig-

inally set up,” Mr. Quick stated.

Special arrangements have been

' made to facilitate the enrollment of

graduate students who attend Satur-
day classes. Study lists and registra-
tion blanks have been mailed to them
and they have been advised that the
oﬁices of the dean, treasurer, and reg-
istrar will remain open tomorrow aft-
ernoon and the afternoon of Saturday,
January 28. This special arrange-
ment has been made in order that the
number of students to be accommo-
dated during the brief interim be-
tween semesters may be reduced.

PRICE FIVE CENTS

Frat Abuses

Draw Ire Of
Councillors

Charge Fraternities With
“Flagrant Violations”
of Relations Code

Investigate Book Costs

Incensed over Interfraternity Coun-
cil's failure to abide by social regula-
tions in carrying out plans for the re-
cent Interfraternity Ball, Student

Council this week went on record rep-
rimanding the fraternity body for its
negligence and authorized punish-
ment by ﬁne or suspension of privi-
leges for all future violators.

Council heard statements from mem-
bers of Student Relations committee
to the effect that the ball committee
had “ﬂagrantly disregarded" regula-
tions which require the approval or
dance petitions before publicity or
ticket sale is opened for any campus
social event.

John Holbrook, Eng, '34, and Jack
McFarland, Dent. ’34, ,wheu called
upon by President Reed Rose, stated
that the committee had released pub-
licity on the ball without. ﬁrst having
petitioned for “special” off-campus
and time—extension privileges. The
Interfraternity Ball took place in the
Hotel Vvilliam Penn, downtown, and
dancing continued until 2 o’clock, an
hour later than the usual time.

Fraternities Were Reminded

Holbrook charged that when he re-
minded members of the ball commit-
tee of their negligence on December
15, they laughed and said the petition
would be “ﬁxed up." A week before
the da11ce_. he» told Council, the peti-

' tion came in, after all the publicity

was out.

I-Iolbrook further charged that when
he went to a meeting of Interfrater-
nity council to urge the body to at-
tend to the matter of petitioning
properl.y for the ball, he was greeted
by the “razzberry—snickers and
smiles.”

on the circumstances of the violation,
said:

“The general opinion seems to have
been that because there are fraternity
men on Student Council, Interfrater-
nity Council can get away with any
kind of high—handed procedure . . .
If council lets this incident slide, we
can no longer justify the existence of
Student Relations committee. If vio-
lations of fraternity rushing rules
draw penalties, the same should an-
ply here. Council, if it wants to keep
its head up, should go through with
this."

To Penalize Violators

The motion urging penalizing of

violators, as offered by Arthur Gold-
berg, Col, '33, stated:
, “That a letter of censure be sent to
|Interfraternit_v Council for violating
‘the social regulations, instructing
them to warn fraternity representa-
tives that any future fraternity or or-
ganization which violates the social
code as set down by Student Relations
committee shall be either ﬁned or
have the permit to hold their dance
revoked, according to the nature or
the offense, such authority to be ex-
ercised by Student Relations commit-
tee.”

This means that all organizations
.:otller than fraternities can be sub-
(jected to ﬁnes collected by the dean
of men from their University accounts.
Any violations by fraternity groups in
the future can be punished by revok-
ing the permit for the dance and clos-
ing the doors. The motion was
passed by a vote of eight to two, two
members of council being absent.

Ask Cost Investigation

Other business of the session was
concerned with selection of the Fresh-
man Dance chairman, Emil K.
Meachem, Bus. Ad., instruction to the
chairmen of Investigations commit-
tee to investigate basketball ticket ex-
change methods and the prices of
books and writing materials at the
University book store, Nathan Gan-
ger, Bus. Ad. ’34, charged that prices
at the campus store exceeded those
at other establishments in the Oak-
land and downtown districts.

The business of selecting keys for
the councillors was deferred because
of the absence of Franklin Kallfelz,
committee chairman, and the commit-
tee was instructed to obtain further
bids. Secretary Dorothy Lewis drew
a laugh from the group when she In-
quired, ‘I don't suppose we could count
on ﬁnes for payment of the keys,
could we?"

The high spot of the evening was
reached when President Rose was
forced to interrupt the meeting to
answer a telephone call. A moment
later he turned to his curious charges
and said, “She wanted Mary's Beauty
Shoppe!”

Cubes And Triangles
Feature First Art
Show Here

By Don Early

VVednesday, for the first time in its
history, the Fine Arts department of
the University held its iirst public ex-
hibition. It was a wise decision of
the department to devote the exhibi-
tion entirely to modern paintings.
More and more during the fall months,
through various shows about the city,
and through the present show of mod-
ern reproductions in the Carnegie
galleries, modern art has been strong

. .-beforeWthe-»=»public. - So ~a~'cou'-sidera-ble‘

amount of interest was evident at the
opening. .

In comparison with other exhibi-
tions of the sort, this was about as
full and pleasing as any. For the first
time, it gave students an idea of the
excellent resources of the Fine Arts
Department. Full-sized reproductions
from almost every modern artist of
signiﬁcance stood on the long easels
that occupied over half the room. The
whole place was full of color and of a
vivacity which Van Gogh, Renoir, and
Gauguin always lend. In the back-
ground a large brass samovar steamed
comfortably with tea.

Beginning with the paintings of late
nineteenth century French artists, the
work showed the really brilliant sweep
since the close of Romanticism. Ce-
zanne stood out rather as the back-
ground of the whole accomplishment.
Some of his ﬁnest work was on the
easels——several still lifes, and three
splendid landscapes combining abso-
lute new force with the color of old
masters. One always ranks Renoir
close beside him. Renoir’s work re-
called even more sharply the work of
the Italians and earlier French, for
with them, he shows a love of color, a
warm sensuousness, and a I‘enlEl.l‘ka.b1e
command o-f composition that only the
true artist can bring to bear upon his
material.

Then there were the “fauvres,” or
wild beasts, as they were termed by
the French who could not adapt them-
selves so readily to this new sort of

Mexican Consul To Speak
Before Interracial Group

 

Dr. Jose A. Vanzuela, Mexican Con-
sul of the Pittsburgh area, will speak
to the Inter-racial Committee of the
YMCA this afternoon at 1:00 o’clock
in the conference room of the Activi-
tieﬁ Bllildiﬂg. The sublhct of his
talk will be “Mexico’s Solution to a
Perplexmg Social Problem.”

Dr. .Vanzuela, who came to Pitts-
burgh but recently, has already gained
Dopula-.1‘1ty as a speaker. Last Tues-
day msht, Ja-nuar.v 17, he spoke to
the International Club at the Down-
town YMCA on “Mexico, Past, Pres-
ent. and Future.”

He is a graduate of the University
of iMex1co‘and has been in the con-
sular service of his country for over
15 years. His varied background of
travel and study forms an adequate
foundation for his predictions of
Mexico-American relations.

thing being done by the Impression-
ists, Post Impressionists and Pointtil-
istes—at least not so soon after ex-
erting themselves in a successful com-

‘prehensioir of~Delacroi-x. ~ They seem

less fauvre to us, today. Instead of
savage rebelliousness, Van Gogh
brings conviction, strong emotion, and
portraits that strike home with beau-
ty and reality of characterization. His
Portrait of Dr. Gachet and his Portrait
of a Young Man make a direct appeal,
and the -fact that the eyebrows may
be daubed in with green and violet
seems no whit out of place in such a
ﬁne color composition. In the same
way, Gauguin is not nearly so primi-
tive as he once seemed. Though his
materia1 is taken directly from Tahiti
with its golden skinned natives, his
composition shows mature and sophis-
ticate handling, a comprehension of
emotions which only an European
could have. The paintings of forms
in angular postures recalls somewhat,
as he intended, the,carvings of Egyp-
tians, but his use of colors in broad
delicate spaces places him centuries
beyond Karcac.

It is Matisse and Picasso who strikex
one as the “fa.uvres” of today.
VVhether we shall come to regard
them eventually as we now do Gau-
guin and Van Gogh is uncertain. How-
ever, Matisse’s Nasturtiums and his
Odalisque impress us as more or less
violent, sophisticated attempts to
give a rather naive quality. V-Ve like
them tough; for who else today is do-
ing such ﬁne work in color. Picasso
is a bit more confounding. It is dif-
ficult to reconcile his various experi-
ments with a sure, distinctive pur-
pose. His Mother and Child, The Ab-

fourth entry in the ﬁnals was also a

ond place to Bob M"tiernan of the

turing ﬁrst place in every event ex-
cept the hreaststroke. The ﬁnal score

makes its
t‘,ont.uining high liglits,

side slants, and the low down on Dental School 2lctivit_i0S, it is ﬁlled
with a diverse assortment of informative articles of value to Dents
in particular and of interest to the campus at large.

The entire sixty-nine pages of the magazine, with the exception
of four teclmical articles, one by an undergraduate, is devoted to

relating the antics of the Dental stu-6

dent body. There is fraternity news,
each of the four fraternities outdoing
the others in_ an attempt at eulogiZ-
ing themselves, There is class news,
with glimpses at personalities and
activities of even the pre-sophomores.
“Inﬁrmary Inanities” and “Hill-Ari-
ties” set forth accounts of incidents
that are supposed to have happened
in the Dental Inﬁrmary and in Dental
Classes.

Alumni news, written a. la W'inc-hell,
presents a line of breezy ,chatter about
former students and ranges in its
scope from China to Jamaica.

Undergraduate Contributes

A technical article, “From,Pegs to
Perch in Root Canal” by S. A. Styer,
'34, traces various substances used in
ﬁlling the roots. In addition to open-
ing a source of colorful material or
interest to the professional man, it
provides interesting reading matter
for the layman.

The article describes the evolution
of ﬁlling material from coal wedding
or charcoal, through beeswax and

vthem completes the

then metallic compounds, to gutta-
percha which is widely in use today.

There is :1. story about the life of
Antony Leeuwenhoeck, discoverer and
first user of the microscope, in com-
memoration of the. 300th anniversary-
of his death. It is said of Leeuwen-
hoeck that this pioneer bacteriologist
was visited by all the royalty of Eu-
rope at his ti111e—among them Peter
the Great and the Queen of England,

Uplifting The Dentist

From “The Datter,” is printed a.
plea that prescription service be given
to dentists as well as to doctors-
"This,” according to the article, ‘‘will
raise the status of the dentist, and at
the same time will allow for better
oral hygiene. Such procedure will
tend to diminish the number of cheap
{patent medicines on the market.”

Finally, a short treatise on how a
professional man should go about set-
ting his rates, and then how to collect
assortment of
sketches. The assumption of the arti-
cle is, of course, that the Dentist has
something to collect.

Hear Johnson
At Club Forum

Discusses Weak Points of

Technocratic Theory

An address, “The Technocracy of
Veblen and Scott,” by Prof. Roswell
H. Johnson, head of the department
of oil and gas, drew a capacity audi-
ence at the Inquiry Forum ‘Wednes-
day afternoon. Pointing out the de-
velopment .of the theory from its in-
ception, Prof. Johnson gave its de-
tails, its aims, and its possibilities.

Technocracy as a word, said the
speaker, was coined many years be-
fore its present popularity. With
Veblen's book, “The Engineer and the
Price System,” published in 1919, the
idea of technological government be-
gun.

The weakest point in the entire
structure of Technocracy, according
to Professor Johnson, is the ener.9:y
unit of value. “It is so utterly inde-
fensible that it will probably soon be
dropped,” he said. _
adopted, the question Will be raised,
‘Shall a chiropractor receive a larger
fee than a physician? The energy
unit is not even essential to the plan
as a. whole.”

The speaker declared that tecl1noc-
racy is as much concerned with over
and underemployment of machines as
of men, and is thus unlike either
Socialism or Communism. “Veblen
and Scott,” Dr. Johnson stated, “are
scientiﬁc rather than doctrmaire, and
further removed froiu Lenin and Marx
in that they look toward the tech-
nologist, not the worker, for progress."

Technologists favoring the scheme
have made energy surveys of the

and have worked out total production,
population, debt, and “man-hours” by
means of equations. But he admitted
that in this, as well as every other
nationwide craze, there is a large ele-
ment of pure “hokum.”

Concerning the method by which
technocracy will be applied, Dr. John-
son gave several alternatives. “Veb-
len,” he asserted, “believes in the
general strike, but this is likely to
lead to violence. Scott, on the other
hand_. expects voluntary evacuation by
our present leaders. However it

the team title in the Eastern
dual meet tomorrow night.

Pitt’s starting lineup will not be
determined until a few hours before
the squad entrains for Philadelphia
tonight. Out of seven possible
classes. the situation at present seems
to indicate that Pitt will be forced to
forfeit in one class, 175 pounds.
There are plenty of candidates for the
other posts, but the majority of them
are freshmen, and therefore ineligi-
ble for varsity competition.

The battle for the bantamweight
class continues to center around
Herby Pearle and Charles Carmella.
Both boys are fast and can hit, but as
Pearle will be forced to take off
weight to make the class limit, the
chances are that Carmella will get the
nod. Harry Conti, veteran feather-

weight, will ﬁght in the 125 pound‘

class, and although he will likely en-
ter the 1'in,e; at a weight disadvantage,
Pitt money is backing him to win_

Jimmy Giannatti, piano playing
lightweight, will hold the trump hands
in the 135 pound division, and is ex-
pected to turn in a clean cut victory.
The only blot on the otherwise clear
horizon, is the fact that he may be
forced to fight the Eastern Confer-
ence champ, Beloff.

The real fight. for a. varsity position
is in the welterweight class, with Ber-
nie Speigel, Marius Santicola, and Joe
Sabino having a chance to get the
lower berth on
leaves Pittsburgh tonight,
a letterman, is getting a lot of com-
petition from Speigel, and the issue is
not likely to be decided until train
time tomorrow, as Sabino is having
a. few words to say about the matter.

Jack Schricker will have charge of
the 155 pound class, a.nd no more
need be said on the matter.

It has not been definitely decided
whether Captain Seigel will fight this
season or not, and as Seigel has not
had sufficient time in which to prop-
erly train, Charley Gongloﬁf will like-
ly ﬁght in the 165 pound class. Gong-
loff, who formerly threw the shot and
hammer on the freshman track team,
will be donating a few pounds if he
fights in this class.

At the present writing, no candi-
date has appeared to claim the 175
pound job, and Pitt is likely to for-
feit. However, Ed Horowicz, 3. new-
comer to the squad, may ﬁght,

Coach Dave Beloff will have a wel-
coming committee on hand to give the
Panther boxers a "big hand,” liter-
ally, and ﬁguratively. Led by the
classy Bill Beloff and the super-classy
Pete D'Allessand1‘o, the Temple boxers
hold a big edge over the Pitt mittmen.

Intramural Boxing Tournament

Shows Unexpected Latent Power
In Coach Crsini's Ring Proteges

 

Clem Edgar Beats Dave Egan;
Five Picked to Fight in
Finals Monday

 

An interested audience, composed
of the cream of the football crop at
Pitt, crashed the gate to see an
array of leather swinging collegians
ﬁght their way into the semi-ﬁnals,

and ﬁnals in the annual Pitt intra-.

mural boxing tournament held at the
practice ring Monday night, The rea-
son for the ﬁght was the fact that
medals are to be awarded to the win-
ners in each class, and the fact that
Coach Orsini needed ample opportu-
nity to get an advance glimpse at fu-
ture boxing material.

As a whole, the bouts lived up to
pre-ﬁght predictions, although there
were some upsets. The biggest upset,
without a doubt, was the hasty elim-
ination of Vvilliam Schwimmer from
the ranks of the welterweights.

-SCll\Vlll1Il1€1‘, who annexed the 145

pound title last year was the victim
of a. speedy one-minute technical
knockout at the ﬂying fists of Joe
Sabiuo. This was the only bout of
the tourney that ended in a knockout.

Bouts were held in the 115, 125, 135,
145, 165, and heavyweight classes.
No preliminary bouts were held in
the 155 or 175 pound class.

Charley Carmella dominated the
stage in the bantamweight class, de-
feating Charles Junge in three close
rounds. Previous to this bout, Car-
mella had won, by a forfeit from Russ
Vogel. By defeating Junge, Carmella

-elevatedhimself to theﬁnals in the

115 pound division.

Only one bout was fought in the
featherweight class, Fabian Mihelic
easily defeating Henry Torchia in
three rounds. Mihelic, who was run-

ne.r~up in this class last year will meet

Johnny Brailler in the ﬁnals.
The 135 pound class saw the most

jfeated both Roman Lapica and Noel
éljmanuel to gain ‘a. top ranking.
‘Evans defeated Howard Finkel. while
Noel Emanuel eliminated Fuller Hog-
sett from the tourney.

Clem Edgar upset the dope by ;:a.in~—
ing a r@‘eree’s decision over Dave
Evans in three rounds. In the other
bout in this class, Sabine defeated
Schwimmer by a technical K. O. in
the first round. Edgar, Sabino, Pan-
nier, Ackley, and Speigel will battle
in the ﬁnals.

Jimmy Loughran defeated Ed Horo-
wicz in the only bout held in the 165
pound class, and Gene
gained the nod over Al Steineau in
the only lieavyweight bout. Staug—h-
ton will meet Arnold (‘rreene in the
heavyweight finals and Lougliran win
battle Charley G-ongloff for the 165
pound toga.

Although originally scheduled for
‘last night, the ﬁnals of the intramural
tourney have been postponed till Mon-
day, January 23. The bouts will be
held in the stadium pavilion, and will
begin at 8 o’clock.

Ten riﬂe team candidates have re-

shoot 22's at government expense un-
der the tutelage of the extremely ca-
ipable Sergeant Gunther, who handles
the riflers with a mother’s care. In
other, a.nd plainer words, Sergeant
Gunther has charge of an ambitious
Pitt riﬂe team that threatens to es-
tablish an all time record in their
quest for high scores. '

Dating from the instant that the
Pitt riﬂe range was completed, Pitt’s
sta.ndi11g in riﬂe ranks has been high,
and although complete results of the
first week's matches have not arrived,
the scores so far show that Pitt has
won two and lost one.

Pitt, with a score of 1,305, defeated
Stevens Institute, and Johnstown Ju-
nior College, and lost to Indiana Uni-
versity. The score from the Univer-
sity of Florida has not yet been re-
ported. All matches are telegrapliic.

Ten men shoot for each inatcli and
the scores of the first five are sub-
mitted for the match. For the past
week, the varsity ﬁve. was composed
of Captain E. E. Mair,'A. R. Davis, C.

264 points, beating Zoller out for the
first. place by a single point. Closely

For Water Polo
Championship

 

After a. fast and energetic game,
the sophomore women emerged
dripping but victorious from their
ﬁrst attempt at water polo, duck-
ing the freshmen to a 7-3 score
last Monday afternoon. The ju-
niors at the same tournament, an
integral part of the VVAA inter-
class competition, were more
closely contested by the seniors
in a 5-2 game. The sophomore
women now rival the juniors for
the water polo championship.

VVater polo, an innovation to
the women of the University, is
played in shallow water across
the width of the pool in four-min-
ute quarters with minute inter-
missions between each quarter,
Two backs, two forwards, and two
goalies comprise each team.
VI.-‘itli each team protecting its
own goal board perched on the
side of the pool, the purpose of
the game is to toss or hold the
ball against the goal_ If the ball
is thrown only one point is
gained, while if the ba.ll is held
against the goal board two points
are awarded.

Both of the water polo matches
proved speedy and all points
were gained by tossing the ball.
The victorious sophs, Frances
Dent, Elsie Simmons, Helen
Urbanek, Virginia. Citron, and
Martha McCune are captained by
Frances Haddock.

The other contender for the
water polo crown is the junior
team headed by Jane McNamara,
and comprised of Isabelle Mur-
phey, Virginia. Negley, Fannie
Hirsch, Mary Madden and Helen
Roe.

More Than Enough

S IX major dances in seven consecutive weeks of school! What are
we promoting——a semester-long dance marathon, with seven days

of classroom rest period‘ between each Friday night “sprint

Q77

Has this thing we politely call a social program really become a

“contest” for dance chairmen?

If so, perhaps we should give the

enthusiastic gentlemen numbered sweaters, and award a silver lov-

ing cup to the contestant who provides the most elaborate cntcrtain- I

ment, regardless of what it costs.
An examination of the social

calendar for next sciiiestcr shows

that between February 10 to March 31 six ma.jor dances are sched-
uled for University students. In the order of their presentation they
are the College Association informal (lance, the Junior Prom, the Na-
tionality Clubs’ Mardi Gras, the Freshman Dance, the College Asso-
ciation-Formal and the Military Ball.

Add to this list the usual number of men ’s and women’s frater-
nity dances, the usual number of organization parties :-ind teas, and
you have an excellent example of what an “unbalanced” social pro-

gram should be.

Seven weeks of virtually’ unbroken e.ntcrtainmeut—-

for a student body that is wondcrinor where it can get the mono r for
. 1:: to 3

next ::emestcr"s tczztbooksi

'l‘h_e chairmen of these forthcoming dances should have the bone-
fit of an iiumelliatc student investigation of why recent camplis

dances have beenﬁnancial failures.

\Yith the facts from .‘_4uch an

inquiry at their disposal, we might look to them for a courageous

scaling down of dance expenditures and the eventual

so vin g of wliat

threatens to be an unsuccessful social program.

I They Mean Business I

S'I‘UDEl*-T . COUNCIL ’S action in authorizing Student Relations
lommittec to punish any organization for violations of the com-
mittee's social regulations either by ﬁne or temporary suspension of
privileges should convince misinformed individuals that both groups
mean to enforce the rules they have approved. 7
_ Student Relations is not “just another committee” that council
will over-ride at the slightest pressure of opinion from inﬂuential———

or hopefully inﬂuent.ia.l—campus orgaiiizations.

At least, it is rea-

sonable to draw this conclusion from council ’s action 'l‘uesda.y night.

If the University of Pittsbilrgli is to have any kind of an intel-
ligcntly planned and supervised activities program, it must have
.rcgula.tions. Dances and other student gatherings come under that
-classiﬁcation: the regulations are and have been in existence for

Dance chairmen, general social chairmen of fraternities
.a.nd clubs’have received copies of the rules as laid down by Student
‘I-telations Committee, and every student in the Universit ywas af-
forded an opportunity to learn these regulations when they were
-printed, in full, in the Pitt News.

There can be no excuse or reason for such a deliberate violation
ins that with which the committee of the Intorfraternity Ball has
been charged. Now that the violation is past and tile necessary steps
taken to prevent its happening again without drastic action, Stu-
dent Relations Committee should be able to expect some semblance
of adherence to its principles of conduct and regulation.

UDGING from last weck’s report of refund savings by the Inter-

fraternity Cooperative Buying

Association, the fraternities have

been receiving direct beneﬁts that more than justify their member-

ship in the organization.

Savings ofinore than $1,100 for the pastltliree months of opera-

tion werc reported in the last issue of the News.

It was also stated

ihat the substantial refund for that period had induced seven more
fraternities to seek membership in the association.

Looked upon as too much of a “venture” by some of the can-.

didatcs eligible to join last September, the association has gone
ahead regardless, and has been saving money consistently forlthe

houses depending on its judgment.

Mr. Strauss,  graduate :;tudent

and a fraternity man, has been producing results in his so-called
“venture” through intelligent mercliandising. As business manager
and chief promoter of the association since the project was under-

The American Spectator seems to
be taking a ﬁrst-hand share in clear-
ing away some of the intellectual de-
bris i11 literary thinking. At times,
the editors have moments of insight
in which they have actually struck
the stones of a better road. O’Neill
is always certain to offer something
signiﬁcant. In his last a.rticle. which
he devotes to masks and to an expo-
sition of _a symbolic-.11 drama, he
writes:

age-old tlieater, the theater of the
Greeks and Elizabethans, a theater
that could dare to boast———wit‘nout
committing a farcical saci-ilege—that
it is a legitimate descendant of the
ﬁrst theater that sprang b_v virtue of
1nen':-t imaginative interpretation of
life, out of his worship of Dionysius.
I mean a. theater returned to its high-
est and sole signiﬁcant function  a
temple where the religion of a. poet-
ical interpretation and symbolic-al cel-
ebration of life is communicated to
human beings, starved in spirit by
their soul-stiﬂing daily struggle to
exist as masks among the masks of
living.”
Are Realistic Details Life?

Now, this strikes one as about the
II1OSt»Slg'lllIlCiInll idea propounded on‘
the theater by an American. But the
remarkable fact is not that O'Neill
dared to advance such a concept, so
out of keeping with realistic conten-
tions. but that his work shows a
growing embodiment of what be pre-
dicts. His. purpose in Mourning Be-
comes Electra is clear, and no more
signiﬁcant drama. than it has yet ap-
peared in this country. O’Nei1l has
powerfully declared what so-called
“re-.alists” have almost wholly over-
looked, that great drama. must have a
spiritual purpose.

It occurs a.ga.in and again that so
frequentl_v our modern plays are
petty e.*;l1ibitions masking under a de-
lusion that they represent life, mere-
ly because they have successfully or-
ganized El. few realistic details into an
interesting picture. “To are too ab-
sorbed with insigniﬁcant truths in an

ter.”
‘truths—the great problems of the hu-
man soul, the stirring battle of great
emotions, the sweep of tremendous
ideas, the Hamlet mercilessly uncov-

rest. Slialcespeare speaks as accu-

selves? VVhy cannot we have our
Hamlet when the world so much
needs one, when the mind is yearning
for rest and the heart to know what
it shall do? VVhere are the great

'_spiritual truths in our drama?

What Has Realism Done?

In this need, realism, as such, has
helped us little. Vvhat meaning in a.
deep analysis, have the smaller things
of our lives? Vvhat power and beauty
has the picture of a laundry woman
getting supper at the stove? What is
the worth of a teapot? Only this:
Such things can carry signiﬁcance
only when they bear relation to some
greater, more universal signiﬁcance;
for we do not live by the feelings
stirred by a. teapot, but by those deep-
er currents that have long ago worn
their channel-beds into the human
heart. Trivialities may be symbolic
of something larger. The bedroom
scene in Othello, where Desdemona
combs her hair while singing that sad
Willow Song and bids Einclia spread
her bridal sheets. is symbolic of all
the everyday beauty and joy that will
pass, of the ﬂowers that wither under
tlie sun. And througli contrast, the
scene has inﬁnite. pathos. There is
no fault inherent in what the travial
does: the fault lies in what it does
not do.
a siiperﬁcial part, at that. Too often
“realism” tries to give us all the ma-
terials of the picture when it has ac-
tually lost sight of those points of
reference, those contracts with larger
values that give those materials
meaning. For it drama, a piece of
any art which aims to give the accu-
racy of superﬁcial things, must.
through its very nature and intent,
overlook qualities of greater moment.

THE PITT NEWS

So Good In

The proverbial wolf has been
taken from his perch just outside
the door. After lumgiug around
for several months, it is gone, but
that is no omen that it has taken
“hard times” away with it as is
usually the case when the wolf
quits hanging around. It is just
another way of saying that the
name-sign~ outside the oﬁice door
of Dr. E. Alfred \Vo1f, associate
professor of Zoology, has been
pilfered along with the name-
cards of other members of the de-
partment.

Dr. R. T. Hance, head of the. de-
partment, tells us he would like
to get his hance on the guilty
culprits; Dr. H. H. Collins, pro-
fessoix is missing his collin’; and
Drs. S. H. Wil1ia.1ns and P. \V.

V VVhiting have taken up arms in
an attempt to ﬁnd those responsi-
ble.

 

‘Stealing The Wolf Isn’t

This One Case

“It is not so much the idea that
the cards cost any money,” re-
marks Dr. Wolf, “for I would
gladly dig into my own pockets
and pay a. few pennies for their
return. There is too much incon-
venience caused by them. Only
yeste1'day, several people came
rushing into my otﬁce and asked
for Dr. Hance, and it certainly
didn’t enhance my pleasui-e_,t.o_.
have been disturbed from my
work when a. name card could
have prevented it.”

Signs of sign-pilfering are in
the a.ir. First, it was fraternity
plaques that were missing. and
that was attributed to vandals.
Now, the Zoology door cards are
gone ,and nobody knows to whom
to attribute that. If this keep 11D.
the culpritts are liable to bite off ,
more than they can chew and go
after the signs of the Zodiac.
Then. what?

Words Fly as Delegates at Intercollegiate Conference Be-

come Powerful Diplomats; N 0 One Injured

“Mr. Chairman, Italy agrees to the motion of the gentleman
from F1'a11cc, but asks for the privilege of bilatc ‘cl treaties with the

United States.’ ’

“J apan, in this controversy, we believe, has pursued a, policy of
n1isg‘uiclcd nat.ional.ism, and as the delegate from the United States,
I ask that China be given full control over her Manchurian terri-

tory. ”

Such statments as these have noL¢

-been cabled to us from our Geneva
correspondent. Far from it, they
were uttered on the Pitt campus last
week, as ninety—two students became
“delegates” and “diplomats” of four-
teen world powers, and met in con-
clave assembled for the Intercollegiate
Conference on VVorld Problems.

The mock assembly was it hectic
place Sunday morning, as acrimoni-
ous debate between -disagreeing lac
-tions ﬁlled the Faculty Club rooms.
Acting as though sent from Europe
with plenipoteutiary powers, the col-
lege boys and girls took their duties
seriously. Only after ﬁerce discus-
sion were such problems as war debts
ﬁnally settled.

On the debt question, the confer-
ence declared a. ﬁve-year moratorium.
But the delegate from China protest-
ed, and promptly forgot her diplom-
acy as she asserted, “It seems to me
that a group of college students should
not adopt so conciliatory and so pro-
crastinating a policy. Unfettered by
real responsibility, we should meet

That was ihe only lapse of the en-

speeches were as digniﬁed as though
delivered before the World Court; all
as diplomatic as though given before
scheming international bankers. The

weighty deliberation. It was a. para-

China harassed Japan as heartily as
parliamentary rules would permit, and
