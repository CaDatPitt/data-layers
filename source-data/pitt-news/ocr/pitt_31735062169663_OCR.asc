ROTC ‘Dis-credite 

by DAVE KUHNS
Staff News Writer

. It.all began last Spring at a Faculty Senate
meeting with a question-—is the University justi-
fied in accrediting ROTC courses? After months
of heated controversy and debate, that question
was finally answered yesterday when the faculty
of the College of Arts and Sciences voted 106 to
84 to abolish accreditation of the program.

The decision. the culmination of an hour and _

45 minutes of debate. will not affect those students
presently enrolled in the program. However, any-
one enlisting in the program in the future will do
so with the understanding that he will not receive
credit for his work in ROTC.

After opening the discussion on the issue last
June, the Faculty Senate referred the matter to the
Academic Cabinet of the College of Arts and Sci-
ences. The cabinet studied the problem, and con-
cluded its investigation with a recommendation
that the University abolish ROTC accreditation on
the grounds that such accreditation was contradic-
tory to the concept of academic freedom.

This decision was apparently not considered
final, however, and the question was then taken
under consideration by the Undergraduate Coun-
cil at the beginning of the present term. Students
and faculty sitting on the council discussed the
matter at length and, concurring with the previous
decision, resolved that the ROTC program should
not be accredited. The matter was then referred
to the faculty of the College of Arts and Sciences
for further consideration and a final decision.

Yesterday’s meeting, the first such faculty meet;
ing in two years, was held behind closed doors in
CF 121. Persons other than faculty members of the

College, including Pittsburgh Press Newsmen an

Pitt News reporters. were refused admittanceto,

the session. The faculty, however, voted to waiv
the restriction for appointed representatives of th

ROTC Brigade. and the Undergraduate Council and,
agreed to admit two members from each organiza-

tion“ _ g -

After the meeting Jack LaPietra, president of
the ROTC Brigade, commented on the faculty’s_'.
decision saying.“the facts that only 40 per centiof"
the eligible faculty members voted and that the"

vote was so close suggest a very indecisivelsitua‘-s

tion.” David Ehrenwerth, another member of the.
Brigade. stated that he had come to the meeting‘,to';
present the cadet’s viewpoint but was persistently»
refused_ recognition to speak. LaPietra indicated’ ..
that he felt the pro-ROTC accreditation petition, [°_‘~}_,
signed by some 2,300 students. had been “o_ver—w~ 
looked” by the faculty in their deliberation. “This 

was an important factor,” he added.

Joe Kociubes, a representative of the Under-'75.:
graduate Council, stated that he was “very pleased 
with the decision of the faculty. The ROTC cadets.» 
have stated that they would abide by the decision‘  V
of the faculty,” he continued, “so I hope they will 
help to make this decision official if it is not al- 

ready so.” i

A University spokesman indicated that if rnem-V A

bers of the faculty were to participate in restructer-.
mg the program’s curriculum towards academic.

acceptibility, ROTC might again receive academic 

credit.

When Dave Hart resigned as head
football coach, he became just another
man who could not win under the pre-
sent policies at Pitt. Hart, who came
here full of vigor in the winter of 1965,
said he could make Pitt a winner. And,
as he has said off the record several
times, he based this judgment on the
promises he received from the athletic
department that, in effect, he would
have:

———(1) A full-time recruiter.

——(2) A training table, costing about ,

$25,000.
——(3) Football practice fields.

Three years later, Hart had none of
these. He did all the recruiting; thus,
cutting his coaching time. He had no
training table. And his team still had
to practice on Trees Field, a grassless
plain that becomes a mud quagmire
after a few rain drops fall.

Hart, when hired, was asked to pro-
duce a winning team. But in reality,
he was asked to win with a program

that had produced only three seasons.

of seven or more wins since 1938. Since
then, nine other coaches could‘ not win
consistently; and this includes Johnny
Michelosen who from 1955 until he

was fired‘ in 1965 won 56 games and 

lost 49. Hart became another tarnished

coach.

Overall, however, the problem goes
much deeper. It deals not only with
athletics and physical facilities, but
with academics. «

In the winter following the 1967
season which produced another 1-9
campaign, Pitt followers were becom-
ing even more alienated, more inter-
ested in Pitt football. Because the de-
plorable situation, especially affected
Pitt students, a group of student lead-
ers decided to do something. They be-
gan a study of Pitt football.

They researched the problem, and

compared it to the -policies of other
major schools. They interviewed Pitt
administrators, faculty members, and
students close to the situation. They
corresponded with administrators of
athletic programs throughout the coun-
try, and interviewed and phoned other
leading national athletic figures. And
to give a total view of Pitt, as com-
pared to the trend nationwide, the re-
search group did an extensive analysis
of current written material (maga-
zines and newspapers) on the subject.

From the material gathered, the
group drew-up a petition. The group’s
co—chairmen, Jay Rosenstein, The Pitt
News sports editor from Brooklyn,
N. Y., and Mike Brourman, sports edi-
tor of The Owl from Pittsburgh, asked
student leaders on campus to sign the
petition. Over 116 campus leaders sign-
ed the petition, and then it was pre-
sented to Chancellor Wesley Posvar,
Athletic Director Frank Carver-, and
to two other members of Pitt’s Athletic
Committee.

The student group, which came to
be known as the Committee on Uni-

versity - Athletics, urged “that positive

measures be made to end the decline
(of Pitt football), and to restore Pitt
football and Pitt athletics to their pre-
vious place of high esteem.” The pe-
tition, the culmination of the group’s
efforts, made the following proposals:

——(1) That this University move im-
mediately to end the limit on athletic
scholarships, which we‘ (the group)
find totally inconsistent with its aims.
We urge that the number of football

grant-in-aids be increased to at least A

35 a year, a more realistic number.
(Pitt presently is allowed 100 grants
over a four year period in an agree-
ment with Penn State, Syracuse, and
West Virginia. )

—(2) That this University immedi-
ately institute a limited and controlled
program of redshirting; that is, with-
holding a player from athletic compe-
tition for one year in order for him to
gain educational and physical matur-
ity. (Pitt, under the same four school
agreement, can only redshirt a player,
if said player misses a season due to
injury.) '

—(3) That this University move im-
mediately to restore and rebuild its
athletic physical facilities to a condi-
tion befitting Pitt’s status as a major
university, and that the possibility of
using the Bellefield Trust (now call-
ed the Panther Foundation) to finance
other badly needed improvements in
athletic facilities be explored.

—(4) That, inasmuch as the goal of

this University’s athletic program is to
recruit the best scholar-athletes that

this nation has to offer, a full-time ath- ,

letic recruiter should be hired.

—-(5) That this University move to
expand and modify its physical edu-
cation program so as to meet the needs

of the community and regio_nj_for quvagli-;'~

fied instructors, researchers, and ad-.

ministrators. We believe that the Uni-

versity has an obligation in this area--‘ . i 2:
an obligation which it is not fulfilling. . f 

The group presented the petition to
Dr. Posvar and Mr. Carver in March--1}.
of this year, and waited for a reply.:;'

The reply never came.

Whether or not the administration .l;_T‘_:§
wanted to act quickly is one question ‘ 3
which cannot be answered at this time... 

Most of the proposals called for 
long range improvements, and even if , » 
the administration had acted as early 
as September, the proposals probably ,‘_}:'—

would not have helped Hart. »

In his third season, Hart had to
win at least three games reliable .

Hart is now gone.

But the problems he inherited will J 
still be very evident to the next coach;

football policies should be changed.

classrooms. which will remain
decorated throughout the Christ-
mas season. Included in many of

the rooms are traditionally dec-'

orated trees. while other rooms
incorporate very distinct cultural
trappings. In the Polish room. for
example. the most meaningful
part of the decorations is the op-
latek or Holy bread. The bread
is rectangular with pictures of the
nativity impressed on it. Elders
take the bread. break off a piece
and exchange it with wishes for
health and happiness.

The Italian room decorations

center around a nativity scene or
presepion. which is the first vis-

‘ual aid to education. St. Francis

of Assisi first used it to teach the
illiterate masses of the Middle
Ages about Christ’s birth.

A unique feature in the Irish
room is the candle holders made

from hollowed out rutabagas. In ’

the German room, visitors are
treated to St. Nicholas cookies.
In Germany, St. Nicholas comes
on Dec. 6, while the 5th marks
the coming of the Christ child.

In the Norwegian room. the
tree is covered with the country's
flags. There are also baskets fill-
ed with cookies for gifts to the
children who visit a Norwegian
home.

 sons enrolling in ROTC. The passed resolution will not affect
 the students presently enrolled in ROTC.

The controversy had been brewing for a number of

—months. In the spring, a Faculty Senate Committee refer-
ﬁred the ROTC credit situation to the Academic Cabinet of
I the Arts ‘and Sciences. After studying the problem, the
Cabinet concluded that the maintenance of ROTC credit is
[in direct contradiction to the concept of academic freedom.

They argued that any course whose curiculum is dictated by

g the.» Defense Department ‘should not receive University cred-
‘it. The University, they said, has the right to control the con-

tent of the courses taught in its classrooms.
The Cabinet proceeded to present its resolution to, the

The decision of the Council, a representative body of

 I 7-"students and faculty, sparked a great deal of controversy on
 campus. Following the announcement of the Council’s deci-

sion, about 150 members of the ROTC Brigade met with

  _ University Military Coordinator Richard Rose for a mass dis-
‘ .cussion about the implications of the decision. At that time,

__ members of the Brigade said they would accept the ultimate

“decision of the faculty of the College of Arts and Sciences.

Since that time, both sides in this controversy have at-

. tempted to inﬂuence the faculty by debating the issue. There
1 -were radio debates; there were campus debates, and there
‘were some verbal confrontations. To be sure, the issue of

ROTC accreditation was thrashed about inunparalled fash-

V ion. .

The endless. debate is now over. And a reform minded
faculty has, in our view, acted rationally. They have upheld
the very integrity of this institution; they have notbowed
down to alleged outside pressure from the community. In

‘ short, they have stood by the principle of academic freedom.

_ — The most important lesson to be learned from this whole
controversy, is not that members of ROTC are all terrible
beings not fit to participate in University life but that
change. can be brought to this University through rational
deliberation. The ROTC decision was ‘wrought, through es-
tablished channels, not through‘ violent confrontation or le-
gitimate civil disobedience.

possibility of a violent upheaval on this campus; we have
heard that the upward channels of communication are clos-
ed; we have heard charges against the “conservative” ad-
ministration and some charges against a “complacent” fac-
ulty. We have‘ always maintained /that these allegations
were off-base. And now the decision of the faculty proves
this point. The decision to abolish ROTC credit would have
been thrown into the circular file if the lines of upward
communication had been closed. Likewise, the issue would
have never surfaced if the “complacent” faculty had not

‘ ' been concerned with a clear violation of academic freedom.

ing to fact that the “horrible and elitist” establishment is

now use a rational and intelligent method of persuasion-

Year’ 5 First Vacation

    

by DAVE TIERNAN
Staff News Editor

The first vacation of the year.
It all seemed kind of strange. We
all had a chance to relax and feel
the full impact of what we have
learned at college this term.

It was funny, though, how
many people I saw that were in-
terested in the athletic program.
Dave Hart’s resignation, and our
football team rather-than in what
earth-stopping courses I have
had this’ term.

One ‘bright note was the appli-
cation of all the Sartreian and
Camusian ideas I have learned
in French 180. After five days at
home, I have to agree that life is
absurd.

ANOTHER thing I realized
was the females definitely have
a case in their argument against
televised football. The avid foot-
ball fan that I am, I was fed up
after four games Thursday, three
Saturday, and three Sunday.

Hometown people are really
something. My sister made me a
set of beads that I sported for

   
   

b o a st of! Furthermore, P e n n
State’s athletic direction seems to
be the wiser. For after all, they
don’t go scheduling top teams (or_
possible future top teams) in the
country for opening game! In-
stead, they schedule their “proj-
ected” tougher opponents for late
in the season when (1) their own
team will already be used to play-
ing together and ‘probably win-
ning, and (2) when weather might
. be a favorable factor. as was the
case’ this past weekend when Penn

 State entertained the warm»-cli-_

most of the vacation. The ‘looks.
comments and frowns I received
expressed the growing gap be--
tween the establishment and the
non-conformists, be they hippies.
radicals, or those who do not

meet the middle class white stan— .

dards because of race, religion.
or beliefs.

The tragic part of the ‘short va-
cation came when I returned and
found that more of the students
were destined to middle class su-
premacy than to challenging or

. minority roles. ‘Again, I re-
flect on a thought of Camus’:
“There is not progress.”

THIS AL_L leads me to Won-
der why the University doesn’t
require French 180 rather than
German 3 (my personal nemis)
and German 4, or any other sec-
ond year language requirement.
I am sure, an exposure to French
existentialism is much more pro-
fitable to a college student than
thesecond year of a language re-
quirement.

Compared to the relatively
.modern way in which Rabbi Ru-

mate boys from Miami, Fla., who
in the cold found themselves fum-
bling on the field and huddled

around smudge pots off the field. .

It’s too bad you don’t use some
strategy in scheduling! Sure, it’s
nice to schedule some of the top
teams from across the country
occasionally (like two years at a
clip), but to do it year after year
is crazy because you're failing to
keep in mind the easy possibility
(or sure probability). of having a

bad losing, teamsome year or
H another! . ' '

lbenstein approaches French 180,

the language courses seem rather
archaic. Of course, compared to
the modern athletic programs at
otherschools, our whole system.
including the reknown Mr. Car-
ver, is similarly old-fashioned.

Speaking of archaic, one of my
friends asked me if I was in the
school of journalism here. After
I informed him that there is no
school of journalism I had to ex-
plain that the University may be
one of the first in the country to
have a school of communication
before thay have a school of jour-
nalism. But, the money is bet
against either in the next ten
years.

ALL IN all, the brightest spot
of the whole picture either at-
home over the vacation or here
is the fact that Mary Ann Zovco
is representing the Eastern Ath-
letic Association in the NCAA
Centennial Queen Contest. With
the help of all your votes. Mary
Ann could put Pitt on the map

next year as Miss NCAA. I can‘t'

think of any coed who deserves
the honor more than Mary Ann.

 

Besides. it must be demoraliz-
ing for a player to know. being
on a losing team, that he's prob-
ably going to be “racked up"
year after year by the same “top
team"! And you’re only hurting
yourself with those repeatedly
big name schedules. what with
losing and all—because what good

A “Disgrunted“ Pitt Fan

Editor, The Pitt News:

I have always been taught
that the Christmas Season is a
time for sharing, giving, but cer-
tainly not stealing. When a boy
works as hard as he can to buy
himself a second hand car to pro-
vide himself with transporta-
tion to college classes, he expects
as an American citizen to be
able to keep that particular car
as his own.

Last week I had that car stol-
en from me near Trees Hall.
When the theft was report-
ed to the police department, they
informed me that that is the way
of the United States today.

It was interesting to note,
when inspecting the city pound
that there are over 300 cars stol-
en or missing from their right-
ful owners each month. I think
the police department is sincere
when they say their hands are
tied, and can’t do too much about
this unfortunate situation. If an
offender is found he is put

on probation and promptly releas-
ed.

Probably he appropriates an-
other car for himself on the way
home from jail. I was also told
by the police department to do
anything I could do on my own

task.

It’s time we seriously begin to
revaluate what is meant by law
and order before the whole struc-
ture‘ of our American System
falls into a chaotic mess like our
Czechoslovakian friends. Am I
being an alarmist? I don’t
think so. I just don’t like what
I am looking at in our present so-

Grad Clarifies Satire Issue

Editor, The Pitt News:

This is in response to the rath-
er harsh criticism made by asoph
reader concerning your satire is-
sue.

I think it is very interesting .

that the reader equated satire
with humor. He (or she) is in-
deed falling into a tyranny of as-
sumptions. But if he insists
upon labeling your humor, let him
have this freedom. After all,
any argument he uses afterward,
must be based on that assumption.

To begin, the reader used the
words such as “poor taste,”
“over exploitation,” an,d,_.‘*lack
of originality” in describing your
treatment of sex in this issue.
What the reader is, doing is de-
fining his own brand of high class,
pompous, charming, and nause-
atingly aristocratic humor.

I refer the reader to Balzac
and Aristophanes where, ac-
cording to his definition of humor,
he will find a collection .of the
most “tasteless” and “over-
exploitive” humor, which, I'may
meekly add, is considered by
many literary experts to be clas-
sics. Of course, the reader
will be quite content in finding
his type of humor in the Ency-
clopedia Britannica.

The reader also complain-
ed that your humor was not pro-
found enough. I once heard Paul
Simon at a concert say: “The
next song is spiked with social
insignificance.” How

refresh-,

ing it is to laugh at humor which
need not carry any great moral
message nor reach the level of so-
phistication of the House of
Lords.

In short, isn’t the reader
guilty of . stereotyping in
the ROTC article? I think if

many people were a little less
rigid in their definitions of hu-
mor, and hence, there assump-
tions about humor, they would
impose much fewer restrictions
upon it — and they might even

find time to enjoy it!

,‘Shake—Up’
Other Coaches

Editor, The Pitt News:

For what it is worth, I’d
like to put in my two cents worth
concerning Pitt football into view.
Concerning the forced resig-
nation of Dave Hart, I feel
this was the wrong move. For the
past four years since I’ve been
at Pitt, I’ve seen two foot-
ball coaches go by the boards.

This makes me wonder if our
football win—loss record was caus-
ed solely by the men we have had
as head coach. I think not. A
head coach can not do every-
thing by himself, so the question
is “Are the assistant coach-
es doing their jobs?”

In the four years I’ve been
here, I’ve never heard of a
shake-up‘ of the assistant coach-
ing staff. Perhaps its time to
evaluate these people and shake
a few from- their entrenched po-

sitions and try a new combination
of men.

Student apathy has been grow- .

ing season by season and before
it engulfs the entire student body
something drastic should be tried.
I can envision that. in a few
years the only people who will
watch the weekly Saturday .car-
nage in the stadium will be sup-
porters of the visiting teams.
After going through two head
coaches in four years, we should
realize this is not the problem.
It’s time to evaluate the paid
pussy willows in the Athletic
Department and start weeding
them out; maybe even Frank Car-
ver will do for a start. Would-
n’t someone performa complete
operation before the patient dies?

at Cuba Hosts SDS Conference

University Grad Among Delegates

Ross Danielson, who is a gradu-

: ate student here at the University,
has just returned from an excur-
sion into Cuba. The trip ‘ was

- taken with 36 other members of .
r . ‘the SDS from all over the coun--v
. H» try, from August 28 to November

12. The members of the SDS were
officially invited and had all ex-
gpenses paid by the Cuban Govern-
ment. At an interview with the
‘Pitt News Mr. Danielson discus-
sed the trip.
“Arriving in Mexico City the
daybefore the mass demonstra-

, tions, in which 70 people were

killed, the second-in-command of
the Cuban Embassy in the city, en-
sured our passage into Cuba,” said
Danielson. According to Mr. Dan-

‘ ielson the SDS National Interum
Committee advertised the Cuban
invitation in “New Left Notes,”
and considered applications for
the trip from SDS members.

When asked why he went to
Cuba, Danielson replied, “I’ve
wanted to go to Cuba for several
years, but the opportunity and
conditions have not been‘ right
until this year, and-I have always
sympathized with the Cuban Re-
Vvolution. I’m very concerned to

, Dr. Herschel E. Griffin has been named Dean I
of the Graduate School of Public Health. He is
currently chief of the Preventive Medicine Division
of the U. S. Army Surgeon General and will also
be a professor of epidemiology. He takes office in

March, 1969.

Dr. Griffin, a native of Valley City, North Da-

- toward

know what a society must be like
which directs its efforts to the de-
struction of capitalism -and the
negative attitudes and values
nourished under capitalism. That
is, the crude materialism and ra-
cism, extreme individualism, and
of course, economic, psychological
sexual and class exploitation. ”

. Mr. Danielson was impressed
with the people he met. “We were
welcomed as North American Re-
volutionaries by the people. and
were allowed to talk to who ever
we wanted to. The Cubans didn’t
tell us what to do in our country.

They only made it clear how‘they~

felt toward us and expressed their
solidarity with our struggle-in the
U. S. They considered the SDS
to be the most revolutionary
white movement in the country.”

Danielson gave some clues to
what the sentiments are in Cuba
the revolutionaries in
other countries. He said. “The
Cuban International Policy is one
of solidarity with all revolutionary
groups against imperialism. Fun-
damentally the issue is the revolu-
tionaries vs. the imperialists: not
communists or socialists. The
people in Cuba consider the SDS

‘Sax!

work to be the most difficult be-
cause, using the words of Marti.
“We are in the entrails of the
monster.”

“The Cubans think the forces of
oppression are the strongest and
the most highly developed in the
United States. From within it is
doubtful that capitalism can be
overthrown in the near future. The
struggle within the U.S. is accel-
erated as the struggle against im-

rperialism develops everywhere.

We can’t overthrow imperialism
from within, without the defeat of
imperialsim abroad, and vice ver-
said Danielson. “Cubans
believe student riots are an impor-
tant revolutionary sector. Some-
how the Cubans get excellent

news reels of demonstrations and’

violence in the United States. In
face, some of the members of our
group saw themselves on , the
screen.

When they were in Havanna.
the group spent some time with
Cuban students who had just fin‘-
ished their final exams. “Many

The idea is that the theory is rel-
ated to practice, and learning is
related to application. The major
study of a student is inter—related
with his job in agriculture, or in-
dustry. All professionals and ad-
ministrators are encouraged to
participate in voluntary agricul-
tural work. This is especially
true for the members of the Party

and members of the Young Com- .

munist Party, who must be ex-
amples for students, workers, and
professionals," said Danielson.

Also represented in the group
were members-of the Women’s
Liberation Movement. They were
interested in women’s liberation
in Cuba, and their role in Cuban
Society. It was learned that the re-
volution of Cuban women is one
of the most difficult, necessary,
and fastest developing ‘revolutions
within the revolution.’ Today.
women are incoporated in almost
every aspect of work, study, and
national defense. One-half of all
professional students are women.

They are free from home tasks

with the development of Child
Care Centers,” remarked Dan-
ielson.

“The people of Cuba regard
the development of the beaurocrat
elite to be the greatest‘ danger to
be guarded against under social-
ism. Bureaucracy brings a devi-

sion . between administrators and ~

workers, and between students and
non students. Most seriously, bur-
eaucrac_y would alienate the party
from the m_asses. Educational
works in production is directed to
prevent such division. All work-
ers .have educational facilities
available in or ‘near their places
of work,” said Danielson.
Concerning the situation in Cu-
ba Mr. Danielson said, “Nobody
is’ psysiologically hunga_ry in Cu-
ba. Everybody has money. but of
course there isn't an over—abun—

dance of non-essential consumer
goods. Since almost everything
is rationed, money has ceased to
be important. Many things are
free —— telephones, medical care.
education. books, room and
board for students. child care
centers, food in work centers. and
all uti1ities..In 1970 all rents will
be abolished. Universities are open
to all people. Che Gueverawas
once offered an honorary
degree, but he said he wouldn’t
accept it until all universities
ceased to reflect bourgeois in-
terests and allow black people and
workers to attend. The education
system is not bureaucracy but it
is organized. People all over Cuba
are studying. Where there are no
teachers. those who have more
education teach those who have
less.”

Racism is rapidly being destroy-
ed in Cuba. According to Dan-
ielson. Vicious American style ra-
cism existed in Cuba before the
revolution. The intensity of ra-
cism and the degree to which it
has been eliminated is reflected
in the statement by people who
-were unhappy with the revolution:
“The Negroes have all the import-
ant jobs today. they are members

- of the party, physicians, and fac-
' tory administrators.

They are
everywhere. White people are
qualified. too. I also met an inter-

* ICG Debate: Could Firearm

Control Prevent Killing

by BARBARA MARKOWITZ
Staff News Editor

There are two opposing views
on gun control. One side feels
that gun control could not pre-
vent the occurance of another as-
sassination. and that those mem-
bers of society that gun control
is designed to keep from obtain-
ing firearms. such as criminals.
could not possibly be made to
register their guns. The other side

feels that any legislation’ which

could save lives is necessary in
a complex society.

Warren Krien. member of the
National Rifle Association (NRA:
and spokesman for Allied Penn-
sylvania Sportsmen. and Chris
Gillotti,. co-chairman of a local
citizens group allied with the na-
tional John Glenn gun control
group, debated the gun control
question last Thursday at a de-
bate sponsored by the University
chapter of the Intercollegiate

‘Conference on Go_vernment_. _ .
The opponents of gun control

never have an opportunity to pre-
sent theirwview. according to

Krien. He feels that “the media
are trying to disarm citizens"
through selective distortion of in-
formation and statistics. He point-
ed out that firearms are not the
cause of all crimes.

The NRA actually does work
for gun control, contends Krien.
It advocates punishment of crim-
inals, and a mandatory sentence
for use of firearms. in commiting
acrime.

More legislation is not the so-
lution to the gun control prob-
lem. according to Krien. Over
20,000 gun laws exist today. yet
they are not being enforced.
Krien feels that bad laws should
be eliminated and good ones en-
forced to the fullest degree pos-
sible. .‘ .
Any new legislation should be
directed to the individual who
misuses firearms rather than the
“average citizen“ who is just try-
ing to protect'himself and his
property. T

Krien feels that gun control
(gun registration specifically)
would lead to exorbitant taxation
of “law abiding citizens” while
criminals, who would have no in-
tention of registering their guns

would not suffer.

“The figures that exist are
more than enough evidence for
the need of gun control." accord-
ing to Gillotti. "There is strong
evidence that violence and means
of violence begets violence.“

He pointed out that the pur-
pose of gun control is not to dis-
arm “any American who quali-
ties to own a gun." but rather to
protect society from those who
would misuse firearms.

“There is no right” of a citi-

zen to own a gun, contends Gil-
lotti. Hecited as evidence of this

.fact that there has never been

any instance of a court striking
down a piece of gun legislation
as unconstitutional.

Gillotti feels that everyone
who buys a firearm should be li-
censed. in the same way that
drivers and car buyers are li-
censed. He wants to makelaws
strict enough that only those who
are not capable of misusing guns
will own them.

Gun laws. according to Gillot-
ti. will prevent the loss’ of tens of ‘
thousands of needless deaths, and
will insure sportsmen and collec-
tors of the right to own guns.

Campus Towards Glee Club

by DON MARBURY
Staff Feature Editor

One of the most under-rated
and ignored organizations on
campus is the Pitt Men’s Glee

-Club. “This is very ironic,” said
Gerald Schorin, president of the
Club, “because we are a national-
ly recognized as one of the finest
choral clubs, yet on our own cam-

pus we have no reputation at all.”

Schorin said that the groups
metre of excellence could be _de-
termined by the groups that it
sings with. “In the past three or
fouryears, our group has sung with
the womans’ chorals of Vassar,
Wilson, Skidmore, Chatham, and
a host of others,”__Schorin said.

The Glee Club has completed
a very successful tour to the Uni-
versity of Virginia and Wilson
College. They will visit the Uni-
versity of Indiana for -their win-
ter tour, and Vassar College and
Boston University are scheduled
for their spring tour.

Schorin is very concerned over
the apathy of the students toward
the Glee Club. “We have one of
the finest groups this year, that
Pitt has ever had,” he reflected.
“We have fifteen new freshmen
in the group,” he went on.
“many of whom were in-all state

choruses.” Schorin pointed out

that the club sings popular music
as well asreligious, secular, and
contemporary.

Schorin feels that part of the pro-
blem of student apathy towards the
Glee Club, can be attributed to
the fact that the students are just
not informed about the group.
“Part of the problem is due to
our allocations,” he said. “Our
$9500 program must be financed
on $6000. So, we have no mon-
ies for publicity and public re-
lations.

The Glee Clubs annual winter
concert will be held on Friday
December 6, at 8:15 p.m. in Car-
negie Music Hall. ‘They will be
joined by the Pittsburgh Youth
Symphony, and the Woman’s
‘Chorale.

“The Glee club doesn’t blow

nine of ' every ten concerts; we-
' »don’t have conflicts between the

members and our director; we
_don’t intend to blockade the
Chancellor’s office. What we do
have is one of the most profes-

sional organizations on campus.

and I think that it is a damn

shame that we’re unknown,"

Schorin concluded.

Although there are some good cuts (e.g.
the title song) the album as a whole does- _,,

same thing can be said of two other new
releases — Wings (DS 50046) and Orange
Colored Sky (UNI 73031)-. Wings is just
a second rate Mamas & Papas bag and is
really a big bore. A little clipping here
might ground a few birds but would save
a lot of disgruntled ears. Orange Colored
Sky is the epitome of the musical magis-
trate’s “Layin’, the shit on us.” The liner
notes on this album speak in superlatives
which are unjustifiable in view of what’s
inside. Don’t even bother to look.

Two albums which -managed to pene-
trate my blues preferential barrier are
Steve Marcus’ Count’s Rock Band (VOR-
TEX 2009) and Calliope’s Steamed (BDS
5023). Marcus’ record is the best rock-jazz
gig I’ve heard in a long time. Coupled
with Steve Marcus on his demonical sax

‘Dry Spell Hurts

The cagers dropped their
opening game Saturday night
to Rutgers, 74-66, but_ they
-showed signs of a bright future.

“Overall, we could have
played much better,” explain-
ed new coach Charles ‘Buzz’
Ridl, “but at times we looked'
quite good. If we put it all to-
gether, we’ll have some fun
this year.”

A short dry spell in the sec-
}ond half prevented the cagers
from enjoying the typeof fun
,Ridl expects. The hoops-
stees owned a 32-28 lead at
half-time. but in the middle of
the second half they missed a.
few ‘easy’ buckets.

“We shot 40 percent,”
noted Ridl, “but if we would
have made three or four of
"those shots in the second half,
it would have been a 45 percent
performance. If we could do
that, we’ll be hard to beat.”

But high man of the game was

Matmen Loser Opener

By MARTHA HARTLE

Disappointment marked the beginning of the 1968-
69 wrestling season as coach Dave Adams’) grapplers.
went down to a 20-12 defeat at the hands of the Univer-
sity of Michigan last Saturday Iiight. _

“I was disappointed with our performance,” commented Ad-
ams. “Michigan was more agressive and a little more hungry
than we were. Our‘ boys let them bring the fight to us. It.
was a hard lesson, but a good one for our fellows.”

Sophomores Pat Lavery and Bobby Kuhn picked up the
only victories for the matmen, while sophs Mark Payne and Bud-
dy Morris drew with their opponents. I _

Lavery beat Bill Sanger 4-3 at 152, while Kuhn edged
Jessie Ralls 9-8 at 167. Ralls is a former Pennsylvania state
high school champion and a junior college champion. At 145,
Payne tied with Ruben 5-5, while Morris and Charley Riley wrest-
led toa2-2 tie at 160.

“Bobby Kuhn did a fantastic job at 167,” complimented the
coach. “That was one of the best matches I’ve seen in the last
couple of years. They were trading points back and forth all through

“I was real pleased with Pat (Lavery); he looked real good,”
continued Adams, who was a little disappointed with the tie match-
es of Payne and Morris. . \ ‘

“Mark didn’t wrestle near to what he’s capable of. Their
kidiwas playing for a tie and he got it. Mark was-a little sluggish.

“I was disappointed: with Morris too. I thought he could
win. He’s wrestling out of his weight class though.”

In other matches, Tom Grant was pinned’ by Tim Check
in the 123 pound division. At 130, Duff Case lost to Lou Hud-
son 8-1, while Larry Cuba dropped a 7-3 decision to Henson at
In the upper weights, Jack Kuhn was blanked by Pete
Cornell 12-0 at 1.77 and Paul Allen dropped a tough 4-2 decision
to Pete Dreighman at heavyweight. Dreighman is a former
Pennsylvania state high school champ. _

' “Paul was outweighed by 30 pounds, but he did a good job. He
should have won.” , _,

Adams and the grapplers received more bad news last week
as junior captain Bruce Unangst, who had just been declared
eligible academically, may have to miss the entire season due to a

knee injury. Unangst was undefeated in dual competition last year

The matmen travel to Ohio State this weekend for a quad-
rangular meet. The meet will be the last until after vacation.

 

Swimming Team Wins First  

Starts to Beat Depth Problem

By ED CONLEY

Swimming Coach Bill Grant took
his mermen into their opening meet against
Indiana State at Trees Pool,
expecting a lot of improvement over his
-first year. The squad downed the Indians, 63-

'50.

Despite the fact that his team’s final
score was worse then the one rolled up against
the Indians last winter (the score was 73-31),
Grant felt that the performances were up to his
hopes.

“I think it was just that they (Indiana
State) got better. They have the opportunity
of using freshmen, too,” he mentioned.

“But,” he added, “we could havemade it
different if we had used (Dave) Wessel more.”

Wessel is Grant’s best potential diver, but he
injured his back practicing what the coach calls
“one of the toughest dives,” a triple twist. So.
"there was a possibility that he would not compete
‘at all in the opener.

“But we needed him in the three meters."
Grant remarked. “We needed the points to win.”

Diving is one of last year’s problems solved,
though. Grant had only two divers last‘ winter,
one was an inexperienced sophomore. That soph

(Chester Zientek) is back this year as a junior,

and his coach expects his experience to be a big
factor in gaining points in this event. There are
two other present sophs, Chuck Costello’and Bill
Katsur.

The big winners in the swimming events.

Saturday,-

Saturday, were co-captains Howard and Rich
Norris, twin brothers from Yardley, Pa. How-

ard won the 100 yd. freestyle and the 200 yd.

butterfly. while Rich captured top honors in the

200 yds. intermediate and the 100 yd. freestyle"

events. Both swimmers were part of the 400 yd.
freestyle relay team that clinched ‘the meet vic-
tory, bringing across the final seven points.

“That’s the good thing about the twins and
Gene Hoffman — they‘re pretty versatile,”
Grant related. ‘

Hoffman, like the twins, is a senior and won
two races, the 50 yd. freestyle and the 200 yd.
breast stroke. ,

Grant had praise for another winner. Joe
Hayes.

“His brother (a freshman swimmer)
talked him into coming out, and he’s helped fill
things in,” the coach said, referring to the sen-
ior who took first place in the 200 yd. back stroke
event against Indiana State. He also finished
second in the 50 yd. freestyle, .4 seconds behind
Hoffman, and was part of the victorious relay
group. ‘ ,

Dave Smith, a sophomore, was also on that
relay team, and he won the 200 yd. freestyle event.

All in all; it looks like a good line-up for
Grant. “The whole attitude is different this
year,” he noticed. “We wanted to win last year,
I’m sure of that. But. one thing was lacking —
not enough numbers.

"Now. the swimmers and divers know there’s
a possibility of being in there." he concluded.

the Cubs came out of the locker

half." To show just how nervous
they were, the Cubs scored only
seven points in the first six min-
utes.

After closing the early point
spread to one point at,12-11, Bob
Cizmarik, Glen Wolfel, and Kent
‘Scott shot the Cubs into a lead
which they didn’t ‘surrender the
remainder of the game. Cizmar-
ik rebounded a shot off the rim
and flicked it through the nets,
making the score 13-I2. Rod
Schoon sank one of two free
throws after Point Park threw in
a one pointer.

Then after two more success-
ful opposing foul shots, Kansas
City High School star Kent Scott
drove in for a layup to put the
Cubs in front to stay, 16-15. They
increased their lead to. four points
when Wolfel scored on a free
throw, and Scott hit on a jumper

at the top of the key.

Both teams missed some easy"
layups in the first half in addi-
tion to losing possession of sever-
al rebounds which they should
have pulled down. Apparently.
the Cubs shooting and rebound-
ing were both below par in the
first half struggle. Although they
still held a shaky 30-24 lead.

The frosh cagers tossed in 55
points in the second half in com-
parison to th e_ 30 which they
scored in the initial period. Paul
O’Gorek, Steve Lewis, and a few
others corrected the rebounding

situation in the final half.

Grgurich indicated ‘that the
Cubs made several defensive mis-
takes and also hesitated too much
before taking a shot. “They did-
n’t take the shots they should
have in‘the first half. We're get-
ting things together and we’ll be
okay. The boys moved the ball
well and got a lot of shots in the
second half

Guards Steve Lewis and Kent
Scott particularly impressed the
crowd in the second half. Scott
displayed good outside shooting
ability, and Lewis showed that
he could drive for the basket as
well as take the outside jump-
er.

To Blend In

Tim Grgurich" is. entering;
his fourth season as fresh-
man basketball coach. He has
more height to work with than he
has in the past and is pointing to
a good season.

There are six or seven walk-
ons with the squad_ who comple-
ment the six scholarship players.

The boys on aid are: 6’6” Rod

Paul O’Gorek, _6f2” Bob Ciz-
marik, 63” Kent Scott, and
6’1” Steve Lewis. Cizmarik
graduated from Canevin, and
Paluzzi hails from Greens-
burgh Catholic. Scott is from

Raytown. Mo., while the oth-
er three players starred in In-
diana. '

Scott was the MVP in the
Kansas City area and is rec-
ognized as a good all around play-
er. However. Grgurich said.
“There are some guys who are
good players. but don’t get the
recognition. Our guys aren‘t
flashy, but they‘re all good play- ”
ers. They’re putting in a lot of

Ogden Nash once said. "If
called by a panther. don’t an-
ther"; but that hasn’t been the
case in the last week and a half
since the Panthers sent out a call
for a new head football coach.

While rumors about possible re- .
placements have ranged from
Vince Lombardi to an assistant
coach at Ohio Wesleyan. some 30-
35 coaches have formally applied
for the job so far. Others. no
doubt. will join the list. either
voluntarily or by invitation.

Currently. a special “blue-rib-
bon" committeeis screening ap-
licants. but they won’t really get
down to hard work until this week-
end. Panther split end and tri-
captain Skip Orszulak was recent-
ly added to the group to represent

. the players’ point—of-view.

Undoubtedly, the players are
‘looking for a big-time coach to
come and save the day. At this
point they'd be better off with vi-'
sions of sugar plums dancing in
their heads.

Abig-time, winning head coach
would have to crazy to leave his
job or else a big gambler. There
aren’t many coaches around that
would trade security for insecur-
ity. Besides, the sentiment seems
to be in favor of getting a Pitt
man in the job.

l .5! 

. Haute)

That would mean that the front
runners are men like Lou "Bim-
bo" Cecconi and Carl De Pas-
qua. Both were assistants during
t h e Michelosen era. A n o t h e r
name tossed into the hopper is Vic
Fusia.

Fusia is a successful coach at
the University of Massachusetts,
but he wasn’t interested at all
three years ago and he might not
be in the picture this year. Cec-
coni, however, is an offensive as-
sistant at. Indiana State (Terre
and he’s interested in
moving up. He could be consider-
ed an early favorite.

DePasqua is a Steeler assistant.
After leaving Pitt in 1965, he
coached successfully at Waynes-
burg before joining the pros. He
has not yet applied and might be
reluctant to do so.

Other names of coaches have
been fired back and forth in the
newspapers and around campus
in recent days. The most promi-
nent seems to be Ben Martin of
Air Force. Coming off a 7-3 sea-
son. Martin looks very attractive.
and with Chancellor Posvar's con-
nections at the Air Force Acad-
emy. well . . . -

However, in many respects Mar-
tin has it too good at the Acad-
emy to leave. Only some sort of
peeve that’s bothering him might
cause him to switch. For instance,
Air Force’s 7-3 might have been
good enough for a small bowl, but
the Pentagon nixed the chance.

    
  
 
   
 
  

   

    
    

Martins name has also been
suggested as a new Athletic Di- .
rector at Pitt. This has been sort
of hush—hush because there has
been no mention —— at least pub-
licly — of Frank Carver retiring
from his post. It simply remains
speculation.

Continuing t_he guessing game.
other possibilities that have re-
ceived public notice - although
they may not have applied for the
job —- are Tom Cahill of Army.
Frank Kush of Arizona State.
“Doc"
Chuck Klausing of Indiana (Pa. ).

Cahill and Kush are improb-
able because they would be leav-
ing superior programs to come
here. Urich, who has had moder-
ate success, can be considered a

darkhorse while Klausing, despite _

Coaching Job Still Up for Grabs as Rumors Fly

doing an outstanding job at In-
diana, will be hampered by the
fact that he’s from small-time
football. Bob Odell at Penn must
also rate some consideration.

If a Pitt man is not selected.
the choice will most likely be a
top assistant at a school with a
big-time winning tradition. As-
sistants like Cal Stoll of Michigan
‘State and Tony Mason at Michi-
gan will rate heavy consideration
from the committee.

However. while the process of_
picking a new coach goes on. there
are other problems at Pitt that
still need to be settled. There
seems to be a new willingness to
put more money into the pro-
gram. but other changes are ne-
cessary also.

West Virginia: on the verge of
becoming a truly big-time foot-
ball power. has already petition-
ed for 20 more football scholar-
ships over a_ four-year period. This
would break the current agree-
ment which Pitt seems determin-
ed to uphold.
