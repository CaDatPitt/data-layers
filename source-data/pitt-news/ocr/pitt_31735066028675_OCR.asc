Getting

I-esiecl for the disease

Behind the scenes look at HIV test site

By Jackie Duggan

News Editor

(Editor's Note: This is theﬁrst in a two-
part series on HIV testing in Pittsburgh)

Sitting in the waiting room of the
Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force is a lot like
going to confession.

Everyone is there for the same reason
—— because they think they are at risk of
being'HIV positive. But they don’t dare
look at each other because they’d have
to admit they are nervous.

PATF is a free walk-in HIV testing
clinic located in Wilkinsburg. Its waiting
room contains a large bowl of condoms
and various pamphlets that read “Safer
Sex, talking with your partner” and

“What is safer sex?” These support the
task force’s main goal of educating peo-
ple about HIV prevention.

Rich Cummings, program coordinator
for PATF, said the task force consists of
three programs: education about safe
sex, blood testing for the virus that caus-
es AIDS and a “buddy” program for
people who actually have the disease.

The education program, called Project
Life Work, tries to reach out to men who
may not admit they are gay or bisexual.

“We’re trying to reach men who not
only self identify as being gay but also
those who don’t,” Cummings said.
“They might be married, they might be
70, they might be 16 and we need to
reach them.” ‘

The project goes to places in the com-

munity where gay men go to socialize or
gather for sex, and encourage these men
to practice safe sex by passing out litera-
ture on HIV prevention.

After education, the second job of the
task force is to offer blood tests to peo-
ple who fear they may have contracted
the AIDS virus. Cummings draws blood
from about 1,000 people per year and
sends it to the Allegheny County Health
Department, where it is tested for traces
of the HIV infection.

Cummingssaid PATF has a unique
policy which attracts people to come to
the place.

“We are the only anonymous testing
site-in the Allegheny County,” said
Cummings. “Most test sites requite an

Activists say abortion
violence is declining

By Stephanie Ellsworth
Staﬁ Writer

Assistant Pittsburgh Police Chief Charlie Moffatt remembers
arresting dozens of abortion protesters outside Allegheny
Reproductive Health Center in East Liberty ﬁve years ago.

One time, Moffatt and other city police oﬂicers arrested 19 pro-
testers who welded themselves together with metal pipes and steel
plating under and around a car that was jarrrrned in the entrance of
the East Liberty clinic.

That happened in July 1990, and it took six hours for paramedics
to detach protesters from the car.

The largest arrest of abortion protesters was made that same year
at the same clinic, when 75 abortion protesters were arrested and
tried on charges for failure to disperse at a protest.

The trial was so large that it was held at the David L. Lawrence
Convention Center. Forty—eight were charged and the remainder
were dismissed.

Abortion—related violence in Pittsburgh is on the decline. But
pro-lifers haven’t given up the crusade for their cause, according to
Stephany Pritchett, president of Pitt Students for Life.

Many protesters have changed the way they choose to demon-
strate their opposition to abortion, Pritchett said. Protests are
becoming less violent and more geared toward the issue at hand.
Violence is not what being pro-life is all about, she said.

Mary Irwin, coordinator of Project Multitude, said she feels there
is no excuse for violence, especially that which may result in the
death of another human being, such as Dr. David Gunn’s shooting

_Pitt fraternities try partying without alcohol

By Vicky Palombizio
Staff Writer

Greeks drinking two-liter
bottles of soda, Leon Haley
discussing social issues and
Joe Cavalla playing Perfection
isn’t exactly the images you
picture when a fraternity party
comes to mind.

However, this is exactly
what happened at the first non-
alcoholic Greek mixer last
Friday night at the Pika (Pi
Kappa Alpha) house with the
sisters of Delta Delta Delta.

Haley, Pitt’s vice chancellor
of student and public affairs,
sent a memo to all of the fra-

ternities challenging them to
have at least one non-alcoholic
party throughout the year. Pika
was the first to respond.

“I came by to show my
appreciation for the young
men who took the challenge,”
Haley said. “They are setting a
wonderful example of respon-
sible behavior that we’d like to
see more of.”

Cavalla, director of student
activities, said he realizes fra-
ternities aren’t going to have
parties without alcohol on a
regular basis. However, he
said this party is a realistic

approach toward Pitt’s overall 6

goal of moderating alcohol

consumption.

“I realize that all parties
won’t be like this,” he said.
“But you’ve got to start some-
where.”

Cavalla said this response to
alcohol abuse on campus is the
result of unfortunate events
accumulating over the past
few years. He added that
Greeks are beginning to par-
ticipate in non-alcoholic par-
ties nationally.

“This is something that the
fraternities and colleges have
decided on a national level,”
he said. “Many colleges are
concerned about insurance lia-
bi1ities.”

Amy Miller, Delta Delta
Delta president, said she
would participate in more of
these events.

“It’s an excellent opportuni-
ty to show that Greeks can
have fun_without alcohol,” she
said. “It’s not essential at ‘par-
ties.”

Pika brother Mike Teti said
events like these are impor-
tant.

“Everyone has the percep-
tion that Greeks are total alco-
holics.” he said. “People have
tendencies to look at the nega-
tive side of the Greeks. and
this is a chance to show our
positive side.”

Clinton authorizes 700 troops for Bosnia

 Wor|d Events

MADRID President
Clinton officially authorized
the deployment of the first
700 American troops to
Bosnia on Sunday, calling on
Serbian leaders to “take the
appropriate steps” to ensure
the peace agreement reached
last month is followed.

Clinton said the
Americans, part of an
advance force to lay the mili-
tary groundwork for the
arrival of the full 60,000-
troop NATO force in Bosnia,
will be dispatched within
days.

Clinton used the post-sum-
mit news conference to again
explain his actions. He said
that the U.S. leadership in
the post-Cold War era is at
stake in Bosnia. Pittsburgh

Protestant
extremists refused to hand
over their arms in order to
kick-start peace efforts this
week.

David Trimble, leader of
the pro-British Ulster
Unionist Party, made a plea
to the extremists to surrender
their weapons before the
peace talks begin.

PARIS — France’s govern-
ment and its trade union
opponents showed signs of a
protracted test of strength as
the country’s worst strike in
a decade seemed likely to
intensify this week.

Prime Minister Alain Juppe
told a crisis meeting of min-
isters that there could be no
turning back when it comes
to his controversial social
security reforms.

Aides said the government
was pressing for discussions
with union leaders but could
not compromise its aim to
slash the $12 billion annual
welfare deficit.

In an attempt to ease
the strike, which has para-
lyzed transport in Paris for
the past 10 days, the govern-
ment said it plans to install
temporary substitute ser-
vices. Pittsburgh Post-

WASHINGTON —— A sur-

vey shows that 78 percent of
all Americans participate
when given the chance to
save through 401(k) plans
and other employer-spon-
sored investment programs.

The study, released yester-
day by New York benefits

attributes the rise to expand-

educate employees.

But Congress is trying to
change the rules for 401(k)

WASHINGTON —— On the
surface, the Republican-pro-

The discontented include
childless taxpayers, parents

ID to get tested.”

The task force has a 95 per-
cent return rate, compared to
other clinics, where only about
60 percent of the people return
for their results.

Of all the tests, just over half
are given to women, with 45
percent for gay or bisexual
men, and 11 percent for
African Americans.

Overall, 4.5 percent of peo-
ple test positive. Since 1983,
the number of reported AIDS
cases in Allegheny County has
totalled 1,356. Of those cases,
871 have been between the
ages of 20 and 39. That means
nearly 85 percent of all
Allegheny County AIDS cases
have occurred in younger peo-
ple.

Of the gay and bisexual men
who come in, about 23 percent
are positive, which is consid-

level for everyone seems to be
about the same.
“Everyone’s reality is very

different,” he said. “I could-

say [to a person] ‘You haven’t
had sex, you can’t get HIV,’
but they still don’t believe me.
They still have their own anxi-
ety.”

For a person who actually
has the disease, PATF’s Three
Rivers Pal Project, or the
“buddy program,” provides
emotional support. “The defin-
ition of a buddy has changed a
lot in the past 10 years since I
have been involved in it.” said
Cummings.

A buddy’s job is basically to
be thereon a personal level for
the person with AIDS. A
trained volunteer is assigned to
a person with AIDS to listen to
their concerns about coping
with the disease.

“We don’t provide practical

son more gay
and bisexual men come to the
task force to get tested.
Women generally don’t come
here to get tested, probably
because they identify this as a
gay test site.”

Based on these test results,
Cummings believes women at
high risk are going somewhere
else or are not getting tested at
all.

According to Cummings,
there are studies which say
women don’t get tested as
much as men and generally

wait a longer period of time to

get tested.

Generally, the people who
get tested break down into
three groups: people who prac-
tice safe sex but like to be test-
ed regularly, people who have
absolutely no risk for getting
the virus but are paranoid"
about the disease and people
who have no intention ‘of prac-
ticing safer sex and are at high

. risk.

“Basically, anyone who has
had unprotected sex is at high
risk,” Cummings said.

People who come in are
extremely anxious for a num-
ber of reasons. But the anxiety

PATF also provides educa-
tional services to the commu-
nity. It has a program geared
toward teenagers and an edu-
cation outreach program
aimed at African Americans.

In addition, they have a"

speakers bureau that sends
speakers to schools, clubs or
companies that request infor-
mation about HIV. There’s
also a training program that
teaches HIV sensitivity to cor-
porate offices.

PATF provides services to
people whose needs are ongo-

ing but not crisis-oriented, as .

well as intensive case manage-
ment for people who are about
to be evicted or have chronic
medical, food or transportation
problems.

There’s also an advocacy
committee that assists people
with AIDS who are being dis-
criminated against, a legal
committee that provides some
free counseling and a food
pantry where clients can come
and get food twice a month.

Abortion

-From page 1
death in 1993.

“That's murder, plain and sun-
ple,” Pritchett said. “And nobody I
know in this area condones that
activity.”

Other pro-life activists agree
recent violence on both sides has
taken away from their crusade.

“There is violence on either side
of the [abortion] issue, whether it
be among pro-lifers or those who
are pro-choice, and it’s all con-
demnable,” said Booker
Stallworth, president of the

_ Intercollegiate Federation for Life

and member of Pitt Students for
Life. -

Recent abortion protests have
been limited to organized, peace-

. ful demonstrations such as Project

Multitude, in which pro-lifers
picket, pray and provide pro-life
literature.

The demonstration is held one
Saturday every month outside
Women’s Health Services
Downtown, according to Irwin.

- Irwin, a pro-life leader in

Pittsburgh, and her husband Bob
organize the peaceful demonstra-
tion, which, she said, is overseen

I . by city police officers.

“There have not been large
amounts of violence going on [in
Pittsburgh] recently,” Irwin said.
Most of the charges against pro-
lifers in Pittsburgh, according to
Irwin, have been minor, such as

blocking an entrance to a clinic or
the failure to disperse. .

“It’s not as sensational as the
general public has been led to
believe,” she said

According to Irwin, city coun-
cilrnen have attended large pro-
life demonstrations and “couldn't
believe how calm and quiet it
was.”

Abortion protests have become
instances of “civil disobedience
instead of violence,” Pritchett said.

Pritchett has actively participat-
ed with Operation Rescue in the
past. During a rescue, protesters
attempt to blockade aclinic to pre-
vent women from having an abor-
tion. But rescuers never resort to
or advocate violence to prevent
abortions.

Pritchett regrets that, recently,
Operation Rescue has not been

- extremely active in Pittsburgh.

She said she believes a federal
racketeering law may have
deterred protests. In 1994, the
Racketeering Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act was
broadened to include prosecution
for ideologically motivated
crimes. Protesters who do not
carry out their demonstration in
accordance with the law are now
subject to prosecution under
RICO, which carries an automatic
10-year prison sentence.

“Some people are probably
intimidated,” Pritchett said

Moffatt said he thinks protesters
are obeying the laws more today ~-
than they were a few years ago.

“They’re still protesting but-
tl1ey’re doing it according to the
law,” he said

Officers oversee all protests,
regardless of the issue, to “main-_,
tain order,” according to Moffatt
This has drastically decreased the
number of anests of abortion pro-I
testers.

. "I always tell the police, ‘You’re‘
the authorities out here,’” Moffatt-
said. “If we did anything illegal,
we’d be hauled out of there.”

The manner in which protests
and demonstrations are held
reﬂects on the attitude of the peo-
ple involved, according to Irwin.
Irwin, a registered nurse,
described Project Multitude as a
“legal, constitutionally protected
activity.”

She said there is no potential for
conflict because there are no
counter-protesters at Project
Multitude. The demonstration
started ﬁve years ago, and at that
time, pro-choice advocates came
out to counter-demonstrate by
picketing, Irwin said.

“It seemed like they were less
productive to the abortion indus-
try,” Irwin said. “The clinic asked
counter-demonstrators not to
come bac ”

Regarding Pitt’s campus,
Stallworth said he has never wit-
nessed any type of violent protest
regarding the abortion issue He
has seen counter-protests, but they
have all been nonviolent

came out to counter-protest.
“Some people threw things out of
car windows at us,” said CWO
co-president Amy Sitnick.

Members of CWO came out to
protest the Life Chain as part of an
effort to convey. their pro-choice
message.

“[CWO] is predominantly pro-
choice, but we do invite anyone to
join,” Sitnick said.

It may seem the number of
instances involving pro-life vio-
lence in the past few years have
given the pro-life movement a bad
name but, according to Stallworth,
“[Ext1ernists] in no way represent
the mainstream.”

Most arrests of abortion protest-
ers in Pittsburgh were made
between 1989 and last year,
according to Moffatt,

In September 1989. anti-abor-
tionists entered Womc r’s Health
Services Downtown and poured
25 gallons of tar on the ﬂoor and
walls of the clinic. Three were
convicted of criminal mischief,
criminal conspiracy and deﬁant
trespass and received jail sen-
tences.

That same year, students from
Franciscan University in
Steubenville, Ohio, were arrested
for charging into the East Liberty
clinic. '

And, according to Moffatt,
many more anests were made in
response to demonstrations at
both the Downtown and East
Liberty clinics, almost on a week-
ly basis.

At the same time, around the
country, abortion-related violence
is also at its height. In 1993,

Pensacola, Fla., was shot to death
by Michael Griffin, an anti-abor-
tion activist, outside the clinic
where Gunn worked. Other abor-
tion doctors in Florida,
Mississippi and Kansas quit their
jobs for fear of their lives after
Gunn’s slaying.

According to The Plain Dealer,
a Cleveland, Ohio, publication, a
Florida Right to Life office was
torched about a month before
Gunn’s death.

Pro—lifers like Pritchett, Irwin
and Stallworth said they realize
there are anti-abortionists who
resort to radical measures, but
don’t recognize them as represen-
tative of the pro-life movement.

According to Sitnick, resorting
to violence to support a cause, is
“ridiculous on either side.”

During the summer, Sitrrick vol-
unteered as a pro-choice escort for
women going to receive abortions
at a clinic in New Jersey.

“I volunteered the day after
[Gunn] and an escort in Florida
were killed,” Sitrrick said.

Sitnick and other pro-choice
escorts were afraid the same thing
could happen at the clinic where
she was volunteering.

The doctors and receptionists
who worked there received “hate
letters and death threats,” accord-
ing to Sitnick.

Sitnick said she had never wit-
nessed any violent protest at the
clinic or anywhere else.

“[There is] a law against
protesting on the property of the
clinic,” she said.

But women entering the clinic
were often subject to verbal abuse
from protesters, she said.

Sitnick felt the pro-choice
escorts were not there to protest,
but “to protect women going into
the clinic.” Her job, as an escort,
was to shield women from seeing
the protesters near the door.

Sitnick feels it is wrong that
these women needed protection
because of their decisions.

“A woman has thought it over
before going to have an abortion,”
she said.

Doctors and other employees at
abortion clinics are not the only
ones who have received death
threats, though.

Last year, Daniel Mathison, a
pro-choice advocate, was charged
with threatening to kill employees
at a pro-life abortion counseling
service in New Jersey.

According to a report in The
New York Times, Mathison
claimed his reason for the threat
was to “instill fear in the pro-life
movement similar to what pro-
choice people have to deal with.”

Stallworth believes the abortion
issue in Pittsburgh “has quieted
down,” but it hasn’t completely
died. He said the pro-life platform
should always be maintained, but
in away that reﬂects what they
stand for.

And, according to Pritchett, that
platform is based on a notion that
human life is precious.

“Tnre pro-lifers aren’t for vio-
lence,” she said.

Finals are here

For some of you this is a ﬁrst, for some it may be the last. But it
is now that time of year when everyone seems to go into a caffeine-
induced craze in order to stay awake for ﬁnals. Even the students
you didn’t know were in your class show up for this ﬁnal week,
hoping the instructor will give something away or do a semester-
sweeping review of the course in two days. Everyone turns into the
diligent little bee, -hard at his or her studies, no matter how little
they did during the semester. ‘

During ﬁnals week and the week before the inevitable, things
tend to get a little crazy around here. So here’s a few tidbits of
advice.

If you ﬁnd yourself in a situation where you just can’t hold it any-
more, don’t leave things lying around. During these next two
weeks, a lot of books, bags, money, etc. are going to turn up rniss—
ing. This is the peak season for theft, when people are concentrating
more on their studies (for once) than what the people around them
are doing. If you have to go, by all means go, but don’t leave any-
thing you’H miss laying around alone. '

,, When you’re in the computer lab these next two weeks, try to

13 avoid calling up those long lost friends via computer and chatting
for three hours to the person sitting next to you. While that conver-
sation about your earlier phone conversation may seem of earth-
shattering importance to the two of you, it most deﬁnitely doesn’t
seem that way to the 40 people who need to work on their term
papers but can’t ﬁnd an open computer.

Speaking of term papers, you may think you will be able to write
the world’s greatest manifesto on underwater basket weaving in
two hours the night before it is clue, but don’t.kid yourself.

I Underwater basket weaving might have a simply fascinating histo-
ry, but it will take you at least two hours to ﬁnd the right book to
paraphrase from. Regardless, if you want to do something right it
will take more than a couple of hours. (Sorry, osmosis does not
work. It won’t improve your score to sleep with your book under
the pillow the night before the test.)

\ If you are one of Dracula’s children and prefer to work at Oh-

 My-God—lt’s-Still-Dark:3O in the moming, or if you really like the

 aftertaste of four pots of coffee, by all means work at night. Only

} ‘*1. you know what your best working hours are. But don’t forget, you

) can’t pass the final if you sleep through it. If you work better at

t

night, sleep during the day (preferably not when you should be sit-
ting attentively in class).

Finally, relax. Finals can be one of the most stress-inducing parts
of college (even moreso than the day you realized you had been
wearing your shirt backwards all day). If you feel overwhelmed,
take a break. Take a walk, -engage in some primal scream therapy,
juggle, bake cookies — whatever it takes to calm down. If you’re
not sane, you’re not going to do very well on that psychology ﬁnal,
are you?

When all is said and done, ﬁnals will be over and you will have
survived it. Best of luck to everyone in the next two weeks.

Thank you, Ronald Reagan

Although Ronald Reagan’s
presidency took place before
many of us had formulated
all of our views, it remains
the subject of great contro-
versy in current political
conversation. Perhaps no fig-
ure is as hated by liberals as
Reagan. (I’m still trying to
get there.) Conservatives
argue that he caused the
economy to boom and was a

‘ foreign policy genius, while

liberals blame him for
increased debt, excessive
defense spending and harm-
ing the poor. Before I begin

‘my masterful defense of

Ronald Reagan, I will con-
cede that presidents receive
too much credit for good
economies and too much
blame for recessions.

The strongest aspect of the
Reagan administration was
probably foreign affairs.
Since it is well known that
Republicans have been much

more successful in interna-

tional policy (Nixon,
Reagan, Bush) than
Democrats (Johnson, Carter,
Clinton), it would almost be
no fun to defend Reagan in
this area. I will simply note
that when he took office, the
Soviet threat was at its peak,
and soon after he left office,
the Iron Curtain fell.

The only remotely legiti-
mate criticism of the 1980s
is The National Debt
Argument. Many people
trace our huge federal debt to
Reagan’s 1981 tax cut, and
particularly to the reduction
of the top income-tax rate
from 70 percent to 28 per-
cent. This association is sim-
ply inaccurate. First of all,
taxes were raised in 1982,
1983, 1984, 1987, 1990 and
1993. Also, the top 5 percent
of all earners paid more
taxes, increasing their share
of all federal income taxes
paid from 36 percent in 1980
to 43 percent in 1990.
During this period, federal
tax revenues increased by

 

Columnist
Matt Mills

$1.1 trillion. So then why did
the debt skyrocket? Federal
spending also grew rapidly.
President Reagan signed a
couple of “deficit reduction”
tax increases, but Congress
failed to make the budget
cuts it had pledged. Reagan
ought to have been more
steadfast in pursuing lower
taxes and reducing the
deficit, but a spend—happy
Congress deserves most of
the blame for the huge
national debt.

A look at more numbers
provides undeniable proof of
the economic boom of the
1980s. From 1982 to 1989,
19 million new jobs were
created in the United States
(more than the number of
jobs created in Europe and
Japan combined), resulting
in the lowest unemployment
rate in 16 years. Real per
capita after—tax income rose
by 19 percent in the 1980s,
with a real increase of
$4,877 in median family
annual income.

Some people contend that
the new jobs created a nation
of hamburger flippers, which
we will call The McJ0bs
Argument. Two-thirds of the
19 million new jobs were
high- or middle-paying. A
column in The Wall Street
Journal noted,  the per-
centage of new jobs in the
higher skill categories was
much larger in the 1980s
than in the 1970s. The
[Commerce Department]
commissioner of the bureau

testified before Congress in
August 1988 that low—skilled
jobs are not growing as fast
as those that require a lot
of training. The Reagan
expansion created skilled
jobs at a more rapid pace
than our educational system
could produce people to fill
them.”

This leads us to the famous
The Rich Got Richer and
Poor Got Poorer Argument.
Nothing could be more
wrong. Real family income
increased each year from
1983 through 1990 in every
income group (from the
poorest fifth of households
to the richest fifth). The all-
important bottom fifth saw
its real income rise 12 per-
cent during the 1980s. In
addition, 86 percent of the
tax filers in the lowest quin-
tile in 1980 moved out of
that group by 1988, with 16
percent rising to the top fifth
of income earners. Not only
did new jobs assist the poor.
but so did charitable dona-
tions. They rose 57.7 percent
from 1980 to 1989. These
factors helped cause the
poverty population to decline
by 4 million during the
1980s.

This is just a brief look at
some of the reasons why

Ronald Reagan was perhaps a

the greatest president in this
century. A master of domes-
tic and international policy.
Reagan lacked only a conser-
vative Congress in his
restoration of our country.
Clearly, someone with
Reagan’s basic ideas. cou-
pled with an increased
emphasis on tax cuts and
balancing the budget. would
be the ideal candidate in the
1996 election. So, with that
in mind, I would like to give
thanks for Ronald Reagan
and endorse Phil Gramm’s
candidacy for president.

Matt Mills plans to be oh the
ballot in the 2016 election.

Parity,
ﬂashbacks
and o bit
ofBubby

 

Columnist ii
Mike
Kovak

 

WP arity.

Parity, in the sports
world, means every team is

7 ‘fairly equal.

Parity has beensaid to
exist in the NFL this sea-

I. I" son. A few factors might

lead the uneducated foot-
ball follower to believe
such vicious rumors. Here
are a few of those slander-
ous statistics:

Two teams have only
three’ wins, the expansion
Jacksonville Jaguars and
the forever-lowly New
York Jets, despite the pres-
ence of former Pittsburgh
Steeler QB Bubby “Yes,
We Can” Brister.

Let me drift from the
point for a bit, I’m having

.a really good flashback.

Ah, how I enjoy remi-
niscing of the days when
Bubby was at the helm in
Pittsburgh — about that
year when Pittsburgh gave
up 92 points in its first two
games but still made the

' playoffs. Bubby said

Pittsburgh would make the
playoffs after those two

‘drubbings, which resulted

in much laughter from oth-
ers.

Others didn’t know. They
didn’t know Bubby wins
games. Bubby came one
dropped pass away from

C ..the AFC Championship

Game that year.

S'drr‘y about that, some-
times my mind plays tricks
on me.

Those days are over for

 ,.....the Bubster, and now he is

stuck on, by far, the worst

team in the NFL.
Fourteen other teams

have either four, five, or

. six victories, lending to the

public’s belief in parity.
Twenty-one of the

league’s 30 teams have
realistic shots at making
the playoffs. Only two
teams, the Steelers and the
Kansas City Chiefs, have

 clinched playoff spots.

Wrestling mucles up Navy

By Geoff Moak
Staff Writer

Despite “wrestling with one arm
behind our back,” as Pitt wrestling head
coach Rande Stottlemyer put it, the
Panthers won their first dual meet of the
season, a 20-15 victory over Navy at
Annapolis, Md.

“Navy is a good team. They’re not a
great team, but they’re good year after
year,” Stottlemyer said. “They never
lose a whole lot of talent. They always
have experienced wrestlers waiting in
the wings to take over for guys who
graduated.” _

As if facing stiff competition wasn’t
enough, Pitt was in a hole before the
meet even started. Pitt had to forfeit at
190 pounds because Mark Bodo was out
of action due to a skin infection. Navy
got 6 points from that forfeit.

“You have to win two matches just to
make up those 6 points,” Stottlemyer
said. “And then you still have to win 4
out of the 7 that are left.”

“The forfeit is really a 9-point swing,”
assistant coach Dan Payne said. “There’s
6 points Navy wouldn’t have had, plus 3
that Bodo probably would have won.”

With those scoring adjustments, the
final score would have been 23-9 in
favor of Pitt.

“I think that’s more-indicative of how

the match really went,” Stottlemyer said. ,
.“When we lost matches, the scores tend-

ed to be close. It was 4-2 at 118 pounds,
3-2 at 158. When we won, we won big.”
After losing the opening ll8-pound
match, Pitt won at the next four weight
classes. Mike Ziska (126) and John
Richey (134) both won the kind of lop-
sided matches that Stottlemyer was talk-
ing about, 14-5 and 14-4, respectively.

 

118-pounder Chris Stevens lost 4-2 last weekend against Navy.

“We weren’t sure what to expect at
126, but we ended up winning handily,”
Stottlemyer said. “Ziska did a real nice
job.”

At 142 pounds, Pitt’s J.J. Fasnacht
won 5-3.

“The score of Fasnacht’s match was
closer than some of the others, but he
was in total control of the match,”
Stottlemyer said. “Navy’s guy (Alex
Garcia) was just tough.”

The 150-pound match was what won
the meet, according to Stottlemyer.
Larry "The Tattoo Warrior" Sprecher
won the match 10-6 for Pitt.

“That was a toss-up,”‘Stott1emyer
said. “You can look through the lineup
ahead of time and guess who’s going to
win what weight classes. We weren’t
sure what to expect at 150. It was one of

File Photo

those matches that really helps deter-
mine the outcome of the meet. That was
an important swing match for us.”

The importance of Sprecher’s win was
magnified by Pitt losses at 158 and 167
pounds.

Redshirt freshman Jacob Schaus lost
the 158-pound match, 3-2, to Navy’s
Randy Walsh. Despite the loss, Schaus’
showing encouraged Stottlemyer.

“He was hurt last year, so he hasn’t
wrestled for a while,” Stottlemyer said.
“Eventually, he’s going to be tough.”

Stottlemyer was prepared for trouble
at 167 pounds. His fears were proved to
be well-founded, as Joel Girosky was
defeated 7-2 by Navy’s Greg
Gingeleskie.

“We’d rather not have to have.a true,

would dive against another

Michelle Rojohn from
Kansas. Coach Krug knew
that Lewandowski would be
one of the top two, but he
didn’t know if she’d bring
home first or second. Her
win impressed Krug, because
she came though under
intense pressure.

Lewandowski learned
“destiny was not in her own

dives determined the winner.
The judges don’t decide
points just on the execution.
Rojohn possessed a stronger
arsenal of dives. One weapon

was her reverse one-and-a- ‘

Lewandowski only rotated
one-and-a-half times in that

Forget Dicky V., we've got Duncan

By Sean Duncan
Managing Editor‘

Forget the polls, forget the preseason tour-
naments, here ’s the real inside dope on the
college basketball ’s top 10 teams. After hours
upon hours of researching, talking to inside
tipsters and tapping into my fountain of
knowledge, I ’ve come up with this:

1.) Kentucky — If ‘Cat Coach Rick Pitino

 

File Photo
Can Ray Allen of Connecticut lead the
Huskies to the National Championship?

 

Tuesday, December 5th

can’t win it all this year, he’ll never do it. In a
word, Kentucky is loaded. Pitino has 10 guys
who can play anywhere in the country.
Besides having eightireturning players to work
with, Pitino now throws two high school All-
Americans and 6-foot-5 Ohio State transfer
Derek Anderson into the mix.

The only problem with the ‘Cats is they lack
an experienced point guard. With that in mind,
Pitino may be forced to move lights-out shoot-
er Tony Delk to point. Delk, who is
Kentucky’s leading returning scorer with a
16.7 average, has never met a shot he hasn’t
liked. But this year may be different with the
extreme logjam of talent.

With Walter McCarty throwing down seri-
ous nasties and SEC Tournament MVP
Antoine Walker returning at the forward slots,
Gatorade high school Player of the Year Ron
Mercer will have to fight to see some playing
time. But with Kentucky’s hectic pressing and
three-point bombing attack in full swing, all
of Pitino’s studs should see considerable play-
ing time —— and if everything goes right, they
should also bring home the national champi-
onship to Bluegrass land.

2.) Kansas — The only piece missing to the
Jayhawks’ puzzle was they lacked an athletic
scorer. Well, they got one. Freshman phenom
Paul Pierce has arrived in Lawrence with the
label of the next Danny Manning. Whether he
lives up to that billing is another story. But if
things go as coach Roy Williams expects, the
6-6 slasher, along with four returning starters,
which includes possibly the best backcourt in
the nation with dynamic point guard Jacque
Vaughn and slick shooting Jerod Haase, the
Jayhawks should land yet another Final Four
finish. ‘

3.) Georgetown — Allen Iverson, enough
said. As a freshman and out of jaillast year,
the 6-foot explosive ﬂoor general came in and
changed John Thompson’s 24-year shove-em-
down-your-throat low post philosophy. With
the reins in Iverson’s hands, the Hoyas will be

Hockey bottles sickness
to defeat Allegheny

By Connie Nigro
Staff Writer

Last weekend the Pitt
Panthers traveled to Eric to
play Allegheny College.
There was something defi-
nitely unusual in the air. So
unusual, that players on
both teams were sick with
upset stomachs or bad
headaches after the game.

“The Zamboni wasn’t
working properly, and there
was carbon monoxide in
the air. Everybody on both
teams got sick after the
game,” Pitt’s Steve Fisher
said.

Despite carbon monoxide
in the air, Pitt still managed
to play hockey. Although
they didn’t walk away
totally healthy, they did
walk away with an 8-3 vic-
tory over Allegheny.

Whatever was in the air
should be there more often.

Pitt’s Bill Elliott scored
five goals and had two
assists. Elliott has nine
goals total just this year
against Allegheny. Look
out Lemieux, Elliott is hot
on your trail!

“The whole team played
well. That’s what won the
game,” Elliott said. “The
guys weren’t selfish. Brad
Rizzo threw me a nice pass,
and I was fortunate enough
to put it in.”

The win brought Pitt’s
record to 3-2 overall.

Pitt started its attack

early. Ryan Moore got the
first goal of the game. Then
the onslaught began.

Elliott managed to shoot
five shots passed the
Allegheny goalie. One of

those goals was a wrap-'

around. He was checked
really hard as he shot the
puck, but he still managed
to score the goal anyway,
Fisher said.

Fisher added two points

in the game, one goal and
one assist.
C “I got a pass from Bill,
made a move on the
defenseman and then
scored on a backhand,”
Fisher said. He jokingly
added, “It wasn’t as pretty
as Bill’s goal, but it was
close.”

Fisher had an assist on
Matt White’s first goal of
the season.

To balance out with the
offense, the defense played
a strong game and refused
to give up the lead.

“When they scored and it
got close, we just scored
again, so they never got too,
close,” Fisher said.

Pat Kenny stood tall in
the net, making key saves.

“He faced three or four
point blank shots in a row
and stopped all of them.
They were quality shots,
and he saved them,” Elliott
said. “When the goalie
saves a ‘sure goal,’ it gives
me incentive to score.”

Bryan Matusic had a 12-6

the forfeit at 190 pounds, Pi_tt

the heavyweight match. Pat
Wiltanger won the match 4-

“You win with your upper-

“Richey, Fasnacht, Matusic

what they were expected to
do. It came down to the

meet, and Wiltanger came

Isabel Dejo ﬁnished eighth in the 50 at 24.73 and 100 free at 53.96.

‘‘It was great to see the team respond,” said Keen. "They got together
and decided they didn’t want to go home with a third or fourth. I thought
we could race withteams, and it came down to who wanted it more, and
we stood up and raced.” ’

The men amassed 843 points, ﬁnishing 100 ahead of Kansas and 300
points above third place N one Dame.

“We dominated this meet,” said assistant coach Tom Donati. “The last
night of the meet we won every event.”

The team had rested and shaved for the meet, meaning they were try-
ing for season bests. ‘

“We expected to swim fast because we shaved, and we did,” said
Donati. ‘This was a great meet, but we still have a lot of work to do.
We’re one step closer, but we still have work to do if we want to win the
Big East this year.”

This team trains the entire season for one thing — to win the Big East
championship.

“A meet like this isn’t about winning, it’s about getting experience.
This was a three-day meet, and that’s what the Big East [championship
meet] is,” said Donati. “The whole team stood up and swam well.”

Sophomore John Haggerty set a team record in the 200 butterﬂy with
a time of 1:50.39, breaking the record by .02, and also won 100 ﬂy with
a 49.93. Chris Balke made the senior nationals cut in the 100 backstroke
with a 50.65. Freshmen Adam Kotkiewicz was a triple winner in the
200 and 400 individual medleys, with times of 1:51.61 and 4:00.75,

respectively. He also won the 200 backstroke with a time of 1:49.71.-

Sophomore Steve Leuter won the 100 free in 45.59.

Both teams travel to Florida for a nine-day training period to prepare
them for the second half of the season Their first meet after Florida will
be at West Virginia on Jan. 27.

Diving
°From page 6
Lewandowski also gained a
new goal, to master the
reverse two—and-a-half

twists.

“Sunday needs that dive to
really be competitive at the
senior level,” Krug said, “if
she has a chance at making
the Olympic Trials maybe
even the Olympic Team.”

Adding to Pitt’s statistics,
Lewandowski’s teammate,
senior Amy Spinnenwebber,
finished fifth out of 20
divers in the 3-meter and
fifth out of 24 in the 1-
meter.

Another boost came when
senior Jeremy McClean
stood up to the pressure in
the men’s 3-meter. Pitt’s
other entries didn’t place at
the top. Sophomore George
Anderson, still debuting
jumps and gaining competi-
tive experience, finished
10th.

“I anticipate big things
from Andy,” Krug said.
“He’s making the transition
from high-caliber gymnast
to diver.” The pressure had
not been on Anderson, but
Krug had expected more
from Soulakis.

“[Soulakis] was nervous,
not as comfortable as I
would have liked,” Krug
said. “Yet this is the time in
the season to fail.”

McClean took control of
the 3-meter and didn’t miss
any of his optional dives.
Making his mark among the
other competitors, McClean
outdistanced the others in
points, 502.35 to 479.05, to
bring a first-place finish
back to Pittsburgh.

McClean’s streak contin-
ued in the l—meter. He strug-
gled with Chad Hepner from
Michigan State but overtook
Hepner to claim second
place. The fourth-place fin-
isher was almost 30 points
behind. McClean kept his
concentration and finished
with 458.35 to Hepner’s
456.10.

While McClean and
Hepner struggled, Soulakis
got back on track and won
the 1-meter with a pool and
personal season best of
520.55.

Not among the top divers,
Anderson continued to prove
his determination. Despite a
failed dive in the 1-meter,
Anderson still finished 13
out of 18 competitors.

“l was impressed with his
attitude and work ethic —
he’ll pick up the difficulty,”
Krug said.

Sophomore Courtney
Sunseri also had an opportu-
nity to work on her concen-
tration and follow through.
On one dive attempt,
Sunseri’s finger hit the board
causing some bleeding,
resulting in only a temporary
setback.

“We got some key experi-
ence,” Krug said. Freshman
Jill Dolbin joined Sunseri in
building experience for
future Pitt wins.

Hockey——

°From page 7

Kenny got help from his
defense, especially when it
came to killing penalties.

Pitt took a lot of penal-
ties in the second period,
but the penalty-killing unit
played really well.

Elliott attributed the win
to a few things. The main
thing was thateeveryone
played well as a team.

“There were people who
didn’t get any points but
were still key factors in the
game,” Elliott said.

Elliott also mentioned the
lack of mistakes in this
game.

“The last game we got

‘caught with our forwards in

too deep,” Elliott said. “We
didn’t do that this game.
We didn’t make that many
mistakes.” ,

The Panthers will try to
continue its winning streak
as they face off against

Edinboro in Erie this

Sunday at 3 p.m.

on the move. Although

Iverson can score at will
(20.4 ppg.), he can’t forget
the Big Fella down low.
Othella Harrington, a 6-9
senior center, was the forgot-
ten man last year. Harrington
will need more shots in order
for the Hoyas to do anything.
Although G’Town can go as
deep as any team, the pres-
sure is on Thompson to con-
tend for the title in Iverson’s
last year (he’s sure to go pro).
If not, Thompson will have to
start recruiting Rikers Island.
I heard it has some killer tal-
ent.

4.) UMass — When the
Minutemen made an early
exodus from the NCAA
Tournament last year, they
didn’t just underachieve, they
lost workhorse Lou Roe to
the NBA. So how can UMass
still be ranked as high? Two
words — Marcus Camby.
The 6-ll lanky junior can
make any big man in the
country look stupid. He has

-all the tools, he just has to

stay healthy like his freshman
year when he almost shat-
tered UMass’ shot block
record in one season. Former
All—American and much
underused Donta Bright
should step up for John
Calipari and "crew, and reli-
able Edgar Padilla will run
the show. Talent wise, the
Minutemen aren’t as strong
as last year, but they’re a bet-
ter team. Just ask Rick Pitino.

5.) Villanova — Some things
just don’t make sense. How
can a coach who gives proof
to the theory that man actual-
ly evolved from rodents have
such a good team? Coach
Steve Lappas, no thanks to
his rake-like teeth and greasy
black hair, returns all five

er flashback. This one is
more recent, and the
images are. much stronger
than the ones before.

Those Steelers that start-
ed the season 3-4 have won
six in a row and clinched
the AFC Central Division
with a 21-7 drubbing of the
Houston Oilers.

Parity seems evident.
Parity looks apparent.
Parity is nowhere to be
found in the NFL.

Why?

Look at the teams that
were to contend for a spot
in Super Bowl XXX (that’s
30, not a movie rating).

Danny Sheridan, Chris
Berman and all those other
prognosticators said teams
like San Francisco, Dallas,
Pittsburgh, Miami, Oakland
and Green Bay would play
for the coveted Vince A
Lombardi Trophy.

A quick peep at these
teams shows: I L

The San Francisco 49ers
are 9-4, with a two-game
lead over the Atlanta
Falcons in the NFC West.
After losses to the Carolina
Panthers, who at 6-7 are
surprising everybody, and
the New Orleans Saints, the
Niners looked like they
might fall apart. This
pleased the parity gods. But
with Steve Young back,the
49ers once again look like
the bestteam in the NFL.

The Dallas Cowboys are
10-3 but look like they
need heart surgery. The
team now suffers from

‘heart failure after getting

crushed by the 49ers.
That’s what happens when
you talk trash against a
team you never beat_before
the game. After being
swept by the Washington
Redskins, the Cowboys
need a serious attitude
adjustment, but they are
where they are supposed to
be —— on top of the NFC
East with the lead in the
home-field advantage race.

The Steelers are the elite
team in the AFC. The
defense ranks first in the
NFL. The offense looks
better than it has since
1979. Neil O’Donnell looks
better than any QB in the
league, besides Green
Bay’s Brett Favre. Barn
Morris finally has the mojo
working, and that spells D-
O-O-M for the rest of the
AFC.

Oakland, despite a recent
three-game losing streak,
has the best offense in the
AFC, with a surprisingly
strong defense. But they
might fall back into the
ranks of “parity” if Jeff
Hostetler does not return
Sunday, with the mighty
Steelers on the schedule.

Miami, regarded at the
beginning of the season as
the league’s most talented
team, is struggling at 7-6.
However, with a 21-20 vic-
tory over Atlanta, the

Dolphinswrnilght ruin‘ things
around_and run the table. A
10-6 record could put them
in first place in the AFC
East.

Finally, take note of the
Green Bay Packers. Behind
Favre, Green Bay is rolling.
A neat little point: Favre is
26, as was Bart Starr when
he won his first title on the
frozen tundra of Lambeau

. Field.

It seems that the parity
topic arises every season in
the NFL, but it is always
the same five or six teams
competing for the glory,
with the same two winning
it. The scenario looks the
same this season.

Picture in your mind
another team besides the
49ers, Cowboys, Steelers,
Raiders, Dolphins or
Packers winning the Super
Bowl. These teams have
won 20 of the first 29
Super Bowls.

Remember that the K.C.
Chiefs are the luckiest team
in the NFL, andalso a poor
home playoff team.

The other teams can pre-
tend for yet another “pari-
ty-filled” season.

Mike Kovak is the assis-
tant sports editor for The
Pitt News and would like to
apologize to anybody who

starters, including Big East Player of the Year

. Kerry Kittles. Kittles, back for his senior cam-
paign, will make a serious run at Player of the
Year honors. But the question still remains:
after losing to Old Dominion in the first round
last» year, is it actually possible for a team to
rally around a rat?

, 6.) Memphis — Even coach Larry Finch can’t
screw up this talent. And man, does he have
talent. Sophomore center Lorenzen Wright,
who averaged a double-double as a freshman,
will pick up where David Vaughn left off.
Forward Michael Wilson has a 51.5 inch verti-
cal jump, and Cedric Henderson can ﬂat-out
shoot. The backcourt is equally impressive.

_. Blink an eye and you might miss point guard
Chris Garner blow by a defender, and Mingo
Johnson will look to add to his 10.7 ppg. aver-
age this year. This is a team that might. strug-
gle a tad in the beginning of the season, but if
they jell, they could win it all.

7.) Louisville — Maybe what the Cardinals
needed was a change of scenery to snap out of
-their underachieving woes. For years Denny
Crum has lassoed top talent, and each year
they crumble. After leaving the defunct Metro
Conference, Crum and his five returning
starters have new life in Conference USA. If
good 01’ fashion patriotism can’t invigorate
the Cards, maybe Sarnaki Walker can. Walker,
as a freshman‘ last year, averaged 13.7 points
and seven boards as a 6-9 center. But the man
who holds Louisville’s success is point guard

Deluan Wheat. The 6-foot point man was the _

Metro Conference Tournament MVP but
watched his team fizzle by 21 points to
Memphis in the first round of the Dance.

8.) UConn — The Huskies have had a stran-
gle-hold on the Big East for the past three
years, but they're the ones choking when it
comes to tourney time. Is this year different?
Maybe. They do have one of the best back-
courts in the country. The weight of the
Huskies rides on Ray A1len’s 6-6 frame. As a
sophomore last year, Allen averaged 21 points
and became the quickest player in UConn his-
tory to breakthe l,0OO—point plateau. Allen
will be joined by Israeli ace Doron Sheffer.
Sheffer’s the brains of the organization, and
makes sure everything runs smoothly.
Together they may be able to scrounge up
another Big East title.

9.) Cincinnati — Four starters return for
coach Bob Huggins. But two of his best play-
ers, Danny Fortson and Art Long, have a
problem with police horses. This summer,
both of them‘ were arrested for assaulting an
officer’s horse. Not too smart — but man can
they play ball. Fortson’s the linchpin_ of the
crew, as he averaged 15.1 ppg. and 7.6 boards.
If Huggins can harness his talent, he could
bring the ‘Cats back to the Oscar Robinson
days.

10.) UCLA — The Bruins’ senior-laden squad
from a year ago is gone, and now there’s a.
new brand of basketball called I’m-gonna-
dunk-on-your-head. Charles O’Bannon now
takes the reigns from his brother Ed, which
probably means the defending champs won’t
repeat. But sophomore Toby Bailey should
have a huge yearif he spends more time at
practice and less time with his new-found
friend Snoop Doggy Dogg. The key, however,
rests withfreshman center Jelani McCoy.
McCoy can dominate a game, but with a team

"full of fresh young egos, McCoy might have ’

to wait in line.
