Jensen, Black Sepdrdfism PSEA Seeks Faculty Favor

Discussed of

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY
“Jensenism has become a moral,
an intellectual Watergate,” de-
clared Dr. Jeremy Hirsch of the
University of Illinois at the Faculty
Senate Colloquim on Rascism

7}‘. Thursday.

Hirsch’s accusations culminated
in a series of slides outlining
discrepancies in attribution and
‘reproduction of critical test data
used by Dr. Arthur Jensen to
support his theories of genetically-
oriented intelligence.

Hirsch mentioned variations in
presentation of information, such
as deletion of controversial data
from manuscripts submitted to the
Library of Congress.

“I argue that Jensen's errors are
legion,” maintained Hirsch.
“Jensen has been acting out a
classic role, every generation has
one.”

Hirsch concluded that due to

‘ inaccuracies and poor scholarship,

  

Jensen's theories are rendered
ridiculous. “There is no reason to
stop Jensen from talking, he has
nothing to say.”

Dr. Martin Kilson of the
Harvard’s government department
discussed the impact of black
separatism on the mechanics of
social change. Kilson noted the

“rise of the Black middle class” as

cited the

program in universities across the |

nation as contributing to feelings of
black "anti-intellectualism."

“No college curriculum could
ever insure an emergent leadership
would be accountable to a certain
group." Kilson stated.

His main concern was that black
studies were clouding and divert-
ing the energies of black students
from academic achievement.
Kilson summed. up the danger in

black studies programs saying they. anvthing

“replace analytical thought with
mythology.”

Refuting many of Kilson’s points
was Dr. Finley Campbell of
Wisconsin University-, who accused
Kilson of supporting neo-rascism.

Campbell said the concern over
black separatism was a “false
issue” and that the real aim of
black studies was the application of
knowledge for use in the com-
munity.

Campbell sees an end to the

black separatist movement, and A

called for an emergence of a unified
front of all supressed and system-
degraded peoples.

“Spring is coming,” Campbell
concluded, “by any means
necessary.” '

Union Dispute Unsettled;  

BY ED HOLLIN

The Pennsylvania State Educa-
tional Association (PSEA) affiliated
with the National Educational
Association (NEA), became the
third group to seek recognition as a
faculty bargaining unit at the
University. ‘

PSEA-NEA has been operating
out of a Hotel Webster Hall office
since late September. It joins the
Pitt chapter of the American
Assoication of University Profes-
sors [AAUP] and the Pitt Profes-
sors Union [PPU] in the battle for
the position of bargaining agent for
the faculty, if the faculty decides it
wants collective bargaining.

Leaders of the three groups
agreed if a faculty referendum
were held to decide collective
bargaining. the proposal would be
voted down at this time.

To hold an election, a group
seeking recognition must collect
cards from 30% of‘the. faculty

Strike Scheduled Today

BY BILL HADUCK

The labor dispute between the
University and Local 29, University
janitors, continued Tuesday with a
strike still scheduled for Wednes-
day morning.

“We’re striking tomorrow
(Wednesday) morning,” said union
representative Albert Price. “It’ll

affect Scaife Hall, the Field House, A

Stadium crew, Towers, Schenley
Quad. every building on the
campus."

Concerning the meeting Monday
between University and union
officials and the State. Mediation
Board, Price said, “Nothing was
ironed out.”

William Hannan, director of
Employee Relations for the Uni-
vcrsity, concurred. “Nothing

happened at the state mediation
meeting. We didn't come to an
agreement." According to him,
another mediation meeting is to be
held Wednesday at 2 pm.
With‘the strike I‘Cp0I'lC(ll_\'
scheduled for 8 am, it seems likely
the 400 workers affected would be
off their jobs for a full six hours
before the second meeting begins.
Hannan, however, seems cont"-
dent the strike will not materialize.
‘‘It’d be against the law. ,I don‘t
think the_v‘tl violate the law,” he
said. adding. “‘te>u‘ve got to be
optimistic about these things.“
Price saw it a.iil‘fe1entlv. “We'll

far as the union is v.vmcernccl."

must choose by majority vote the

The Commonwealth Labor Rela-
tions Board governs the decision
process. _

PSEA campaign coordinator for
Pitt, Phil Encinio, would not
divulge the number of Pitt PSEA
members “in the middle of an
election drive.” He said his group
is moving cautiously, working with
a caucus that has not yet selected
its own president.

“There is not a university
anywhere where you ean’t get
cards,” Encinio said. “The danger
is holding the election too soon.”
He indicated if the cards were
submitted to the labor board
requesting an election, collective
bargaining would be defeated.

PPU President Van Beck Hall,
history professor, agreed: “The
campaign now is’ not between the
agencies, but to convince the
faculty of the need for collective
bargaining...Once we get into the
labor board, then we can start
among one another.”

Invoice Procedure Reviewed  

BY FELICE NEWMAN

In reaction to student com-
plaints. five proposals concerning
invoice procedures have been
raised by Vice Chancellor of
Operations Joseph Dutton. other
administrative officials and Tim
Ging. a Student Government
representative.

According to Dean of Admissions
and Student Aid Kenneth Wenger.
the December 26 meeting was

called “for Tim to till in the Vice
Chancellor area about problems
Tim had heard of from other
students."

Action could be taken as early as
spring session for one proposal, a
motion to include University
scholarships on the new itemized
invoice. This would permit
students to return invoices to (3-35
without first processing scholar-
ships.

Wenger said this would be a
step in the right direction,” and
that “students wouldn’t have to go
through hassles” inpaying tuition.
He stressed the addition of
University scholarships to spring
session invoices would be an
experiment.

“We won't be able to do this with
loans." said Wenger, “because of
promissory notes that must be
signed by the student. We have
with state scholarships
because of late notiﬁcation.

“For instance. last term notifica-
tion of state scholarships weren't
received until September. We
have to work out a system of

“Most kids who pay in person
don’t have to,” Ging said. Invoice
mailing would be encouraged by
placing portable mailboxes near
G-35 and at other strategic points
on campus.

The renovation of G-35 would
ameliorate some of the problems
associated with tuition paying,
according to Dutton and Ging.
With niere windows there would be
more, and therefore shorter,
waiting lines.

“During peak periods there will
be more trained people working,"
Ging said. “This depends upon the
resources available."

Another proposed innovation is
the placement of permanent signs
near G-35 explaining payment
procedures for students with loans

A “Black politics and white politics

' white government can never fulﬁll
black needs, suggested’ Ebony
magazine senior staff’ editor Alex
A Poinsett. ' ’
Focusing on Watergate, Poinsett
said, “The United States is a nation
" of crisises," listing energy and
' inﬂation as two, “but none is equal
in its severity and intensity as
P Watergate.” He labeled it “the
-I greatest criminal, political, moral
“ scandal in this country's history.”
a» Poinsett speaking to an audience
.1’ in the SU Ballroom, emphasized
Q. that Watergate was a product of a
. ‘white political system and no
blacks were involved. “However,”
he added, “23 blacks were among
200 listed by the White House as
, enemies to be dealt with by the
lntemal Revenue Service.” I
Watergate was no surprise to
black people, according to Poinsett.
While whites viewed it as a quirk or
~ just a third rate burglary, he said,
 blacks saw it as a continuation of
the corruption of a white govern-
ment,

Poinsett stated, pointing out the
current freedom of Spiro Agnew

and John Deal III as examples of '

white jurisdiction over justice.

“Blacks are obliged to.continue
to survive in a society that treats
them as outcasts,” Poinsett con-
tinued. He cited continued
discrimination in jobs and under-
representation in politics as two
areas of black inequality.

Poinsett -listed six levels of
economic-political power over
which blacks had no control: the
military-industrial complex. federal
and state government, the crime
syndicate, organized labor, the 500
largest corporations in the US, and
private wealth.

Poinsett said, “Blacks arenot
going to become politically
separate from whites," But, in
what he called “the crucial issue of
the ‘72 elections," could blacks
challenge, through group politics,
the established parties in the US?
Poinsett cited Shirley Chisholm’s
candidacy and the National Black
Political convention in Gary,
Indiana, as proof that blacks are
ready to make that challenge.

“A party would inspire blacks to

search for new direction,” Poinsett
said. Reaching that goal will be a
black “challenge for the remainder
of this Watergate century.”

Poinsett, an expert on black
education, the presidency, and
black politics, was sponsored by
the Black Action Society (BAS) in
observance of Martin Luther King
Day at Pitt.

would eliminate students waiting in
line at G-35 to find they needed to
go elsewhere to first process their

loans or scholarships.

Wenger felt signs were not the
answer. “Most people don’t read.
This goes for students and others.
You can put up signs, place full
page ads in the Pitt News, but
there’ll still be people who don’t
know what’s happening.”-

A last proposal is staggering
invoice due-dates. Wenger fore-
sees problems in attempting this.
“Seniors register first, and then
juniors. Is it fair for them to have
to pay ﬁrst?”

Wenger cited another problem in
the procedure. “Where do you
send the invoices? Half of the time
they don’t know what the student's
real address is. Students move a
lot and often don’t‘ leave forward-
ing addresses. This is a problem
during the winter term. Where do
you send it? You have to end up
sending it to the family address.”

“There's been a minor revolu-

maybe one or two students in
freshman chemistry classes used
calculators. Now it's the exception
for people not to have them.

“And calculators do confer a
certain advantage to those students

don’t,” insists Dr. Gordon Ryan,

teachers--that the ever-growing

number of calculators may be more
efficient and hence offer an unfair
advantage over the traditional slide
rule.

Already such colleges as UCLA
and the University of California at
Berkeley have banned the use of
calculators on exams where time is
crucial. Carnegie-Mellon Univer-
sity has also limited calculator use
by upperclassmen on exams.

the calculator problem has only
reached the “talk stage".

Biophysics and microbiology
Chairman Max Louffer, said “I
have no policy, and I know of none
in my department, to limit the use
calculators. .

“After all, the slide rule is a
calculator, only the calculator is
more precise. On exams, the time
gained using a calculator would be
a little, but not very much. We’d
be talking about seconds, not about
minutes.”

Physics Chairman Phillip Stehle,
disagrees. “I'm against their use
on most exams. But then, I don’t
believe an exam should be
formulated in such a way as to offer
an unfair advantage.”

Stehle’s view was supported by
mathematics Chairman W.F.
Deskins. He also believes if time is
a necessary factor in an exam, it

.should be resolved to make
_ calculators available to everyone,

but still better, make the exams so
that time is not vital."

Both biology Chairman Charles
Ralph, and biochemistry Chairman
Ron Bentley commented on the
increasingly lower price of the
calculator. Bentley said. “We’re

 

approaching the point where '
calculators will be made manda-' 

tory. xlust as slide rules are.”

Calculators are priced from $40.?

to $400. A good slide rule can cost
as much as a cheap calculator.

Still, many non-science majors, 
who usually need neither a good
slide rule or a calculator are buying _ 

$100 calculators. Why?

u I The next five

By RICHARD SWARTZ
and SCOTT MACLEOD

V The Student Government (SG)
elections on January 22, 23 have
attracted two candidates for pres-
; ident and 14 candidatesfor Board.
_ In a break with tradition, The
f ,‘ Pitt News interviewed each can-
" didate to determine their posi-
tions ‘on important issues. Ex-
cerpts from the interviews con-
ducted last weekend will appear in
.' "a three-part installment ending
1:» -- Friday.

Yaier

Lehrer

Q: What issue are you directing
__ yourself towards in the SGB
 campaign?

 Lehrer: There are two issues that

--are very close together. The first is
that Student Government has been
pumping money into WPGH
(campus radio) for years. I think

- the Board should support the

station in becoming an FM station.

A Quality has to be improved down
there. and when it is it can be very
much self-supporting. The Board
should give WPGH high priority
_to help get it off the ground. The

"entire University could beneﬁt

Q quite a lot from a good radio

.  station.

‘Q: What is the other issue?
Lehrer: It concerns the conflict
between all the publications and
the Student Government Board.

I The Board has no right to tell any

V - publication what to print and what

not to print. The money is not the

 Allocations Committee's--it's the
students’. But the publications are

not entities to themselves. The
student body has the right to look
closely at what they are doing. The

Student Government has the right
to do so also--just like any other
student.

Q: As a Board member, what role

Yaier Leher
photo by Redic

would you play in relation to
publications, including WPGH?
Lehrer: First. I would review the
work in a supervisory capacity. I
would also act as an adviser on
matters which they might ask for
advice in. But I would draw the
line there. Student Government
 doesn't have the right to directly
A censor because in their opinion the
quality isn't good enough.

Ruth
Weinbrom

Q: What in your,opinion, is the
most important issue in the
campaign?

Weinbrom: I think I would like to
see RSA (Resident Students
Association) become a stronger
organization. This year they have
received a cut in allocations for
programming mainly because the

Ruth Wienbrom
photo by Matera

RSA has a lack of strength and
planning. I'd like to see dorm
students represented in Student
Government.

Q: What are some of the problems
with RSA you would like to
remedy?

Weinbrom: Well. there are always
hassles between Student Govern-
ment and RSA about who should
have jurisdiction in the student
food services problem.

Another problem is the program-
ming for dorm students. When
only $2000 goes for programming
for 3000 students it is not planned
very efficiently.

So the issue here is to get Student
Government to actually recognize
how useful RSA can be to it and
vice versa. It's a matter of RSA
presenting worthwhile ideas and
Student Government listening to
them. ,

Q: What other areas are you
concerned with?

(Continued on Page 5)

Mark
Satinoff

Q: What have you made the
outstanding point in your campaign
program?

Satinoff: I think it's important that
Student Government start address-
ing itself to the problems that exist
not only on this University. but also
around it. I believe there's a
fundamental link between the two.
Problems such as unemployment,
inflation. the Mideast and Water-
gate all have a profound influence
on our lives. and it should be the
job of Student Government to keep
the students aware and informed
on these issues, in addition to its
regular duties. , '

 
  
   

 

 

Mark Satinoff
photo by Redic

Q: What do you see as the
problems confronting this Univer-
sity?

Satinoff: For one. there's the
problem of security, and the
inadequate response that has met
it. The answer is not more locks,
more guards, and more guns that
will keep the campus isolated from
the community. We of the YSA
(Young Socialist’ , Alliance) are
interested in some form of
interaction between the two. This
University should be opened up to
the community, allowing the
residents to be part of the
educational programs, to use the
library and medical buildings, and
to receive something in return for
what they lost.

Q: How does a Board member
participate in this.process?
Satinoff: I feel it's necessary to
form some kind of united front
among the students that will enable

them to act as one unit on this

Patricia
Ford

Q: How would you define the
major issue in your campaign?
Ford: I think the University and
Student Government should recog-
nize and deal with the social
problems. especially those that
manifest themselves here, such as
the direction of the country.
racism. and educational impotency.
Q: On the subject of education
impotency,-how do you plan to
combat it?

Ford: In academic matters.
Student Government should have
more involvement with _the devel-
opment of the curriculum. One of
the ways it can really help the
student is to give alternatives to the
present grading system. Student
Government should help the
University establish three alternate
grading procedures. whereby all of
the courses would be categorized
under one of the following three
headings: straight-grading,
credit/no entry. and ABC grading.
Q: How does ABC grading work?
Ford: In ABC grading. the lowest
grades in those particular courses
would be a C.

Q: Who would determine what
those particular courses would be?
Ford: I don’t know offhand.
Perhaps some kind of committee
composed of students and faculty

could determine just which courses
would fall under that heading.

Q: You mentioned racism. Do you
feel Student Government has been
responding to the needs of black

' students?

Ford: I feel there should be more
black student input into Student
Government. Many blacks are
unaware of what Student Govern-
ment is, doing, what Student
Government's function is, and of
the advantages Student_ Govern-
ment may have for them.

Q: Do you believe blacks have
received equitable treatment in
regards to programming?

Ford: No. I don't. I mean Martin
Mull and his Fabulous Furniture is
not my idea of black programming.
Allocations should be distributed in
a way that helps create social
diversity. Even if it means having
a calendar conflict over two
separate events, still they both
should be scheduled, so all
students can have a choice of

- seeing one or the other.

Mary
Heider

Question: What issues are you
basing your race for Board on?
Heider: First of all, I think the
mechanics of this University needs-
to be streamlined. There's too
much confusion in the administra-
tive offices, and this is evident by
the bureaucratic red tape. the long
invoice lines, etc.

These lines are unbelievably
large. and people in authority are
generally nowhere to be found.
The two offices most affected by all
of this are the Student Accounts

power of the chair, actsas 

 

 

  
  
   
  
  

  

Aid

office and the Student
department.
Q How do you propose to eliminate

this confusion?

Heider:- I believe a task force needs

to be set up, with students and 
people who are experts in the/ﬁeld, ‘
perhaps some kind of engineers.

The system has to be redone by

H - investigating it, finding out what

the problems are, and remedying
them. I personally will look into it
myself first, and go out and find the
people who are qualified to help us.
Q And your secondary issue?
Heider: The counseling and
advising system. These people do_
nothing but assign classes, and the
quality of their assistance is
worthless, especially fora fresh-
man or transfer student ,who
doesn't have a specific goal in
mind. .

We could set up a periodic check
on the advisers to make sure
they're doing their jobs. We
definitely would have to set up
some sort of faculty committee to
review their work.

I should make it clear that I don’t
place complete blame on the
advisers, since they have no source
of printed information that they can
consult to help them better do their 
jobs.

Q What is your position on
allocations? Do you have any
priorities?

Heider: The system of allocations
is quite complex. One problem is
that many activities are not geared
forall groups or students. Perhaps
Student Government could take a
poll to determine where their
interests lie before allocating
money.

(Continued from Page 4)
Weinbrom: There are a lot of
students being ihassled about
invoice problems, like not receiving
scholarships and having their
invoices cancelled. And sometimes
you don’t get the invoice in time,
but the University expects you to
pay it by the due date anyway.
Q: What do you intend to do about
it?

Weinbrom: By looking into the
present system to see why it is
running effeciently; why haven’t
the people received their invoices
on time.

Q: What about the programming
issue? f

Weinbrom: Here the priorities lie
in the type of programs that would

possible. It is

or political differences. We can
attract students by demonstrating
that Student Government is an
organization capable of democratic

decision making and coordinating.

important to.

mass, but independent, student

action.

Q: How do you project this image
of democratic decision making?

Satinoff: By finding out what the
students want before we act. This
can be done through a massive
educational campaign on the
particular issue, through teach~ins,
ﬁlms. Pitt News articles, and
posters. We could schedule rallies,
calling fro input from both student
and community organizations. By
making our issue public. we would
be assuring the students of having
a voice in Student Government
activiities.

(C/ontinued from Page 4)

Perhaps Student Government
could draw up some by-laws
stipulating what type of activities it
intends to fund, so that the
problem of allocation of resources
would not have to arise each time a
group asked for money.

_Ietter to the Editor

Dear Sir:

In the article in The Pitt News of
Dec. 3 on Nuclear Power, there was
one misprint-‘-estimates of present
day deaths from air pollution are
between 5,000 and 100,000 deaths
per year. However, more
objectionable were some of the
statements in the article attributed
to David Marshall. The accident
which might cause $70 billion in
damage is not the one that might
happen once in 10,000 years of
reactor operation-—once in 500
million years is a much better
estimate.

If two aspects of the protective
system whose reliability is only
about 98% assured were to fail, the
catastrophic accident would occur
once in 100,000 years; but one of
these aspects will be thoroughly
tested in the next few years, and
the other is under intensive study.
Opponents of nuclear power
constantly make the worst possible
assumptions; if this were done for
the effects of air pollution, one
could easily argue that it is now
killing a half million people per
year in US, and if the electric power
Mar/shall projects for the year 2000
were derived from coal, one could
justify an estimate that it will kill
1‘/2 million Americans per year.

Marshall's statements about
Plutonium are equally exagger-
ated. He says that a billionth of a
gram breathed into the lungs could
cause lung cancer--the probability
for this is about one in 5000. His
statement that there is no known
way of containing radioactive wates
for more than five years is
obviously wrong. This material is
being converted to a rock-like
ceramic. and anyone knows that
such a material is easily contained.
The method now planned is to store
it in carefully guarded concrete
vaults until one of the methods of
permanent burial now under
consideration is determined to be
absolutely safe. (It could be kept in
these concrete vaults indefinitely if
we are willing to watch them.)

There is no basis for his

statement that engineering for‘-

waste disposal must be 99.9999....
percent accurate to avert major
disaster--unless he is willing to
make a similar statement regarding
the Pitt swimming pool because it

contains enough water to drown ab .

million people.
In stating his

future generations will have to live

with, he ignores the fact that our _ i
world has always contained a‘

hundred thousand times as muchg
radioactivity as he is talking about. ’ i I

It is in our bodies, in the air we
breathe, in the ground, and in the
bricks of our buildings. Why does
he worry about such a very tiny bit
more? If he is worried about our
legacy to future generations, why

A not leave them some of the coal and _

oil we are using up so fast. They
may need it to make plastics to
substitute for the metals we are

also using up, or to make medicines ‘V I fl.

and other chemicals. Wouldn’t it
be better to make our electric
power from uranium?

In Oakland people are standing

Somewhere in the murk of a
primordial swamp a silver mist is
parting for a giant. Steaming
tropical reservoirs hiss menacingly
in the distance. Vines overhang
trees, carpet the sky with green.
And, everywhere, everything
smells dinosaur.

How do you stuff a dinosaur in a
phonebooth? In the early days,
man was at a loss. Woman was at a
loss too. Civilization had not yet
attained the ascendancy over the
jungle that we enjoy today. One
small step for dinosaur was still one
giant step for mankind.

And, Man-Woman did not have
many things which time has taken
from us. Man-Woman did not have
Rock ‘n Roll, Pitt Football,
Nostalgia. Man-Woman did not
even have Peace with Honor.

A Dinosaur In A

" weanesaay, January it}, 1974

Nevertheless, experts estimate that
historically, socially, politico-
economically, and with an eye to
sanitation Man-Woman had a place
for dinosaurs. This is good and as
it should be.

Darwin said that a three-winged '
duck with a loaf of bread is cousin
to a turkey. But, Darwin carelessly
overlooked dinosaurs. In the
annals of egg layers, such a
precedent was unfortunate.
Man-Woman is only now breaking
out of his-her shell in an attempt,
as Dahli illustrated, to appreciate
these surprisingly witless beasts.

Consider the dinosaur, as he saw
himself, before Darwin. Certainly
dinosaur was not a sexist creature.
It has been argued that man-
dinosaur woman-dinosaur, to
employ human constructs, pro-
bably evolved out of sexual
awareness and therefore sexisms of
all kinds. One scholar, at the
University of Pittsburgh at Brad-
ford hypothesized that dinosaurs in
an attempt at equality undis-
covered their own sexuality.

Be these spurious attempts at
scholarship what they may, dino-
saur acheived in reality what man
can only hope to approximate --
Extinction.

The importance of these ﬁnds is
unclear. Time and space erases
much. But time will hardly erase
the intrique of the impressive
collection of prehistoric wonders
right next door to Pitt at the
Carnegie Museum.

if The James Montgomery Bond

BY DOUGLAS E. GEBHARD

Johnny Winter, Electric Light
Orchestra, and the James Mont-
the J. Geils
Band...far out! No, the Jimmy
Montgomery Band outa' Boston.'..
wow.

This was a concert before
Christmas at the Arena...amen, of
which I was guest of the band and
Capricorn records. The purpose
was to see this relatively unknown
band on their label (CPOOIZO) and
talk to the boys.

For a small band [or at least
unheard of here], highlighting it
with people like Edgar and Johnny
Winter and Poco they took the

attention of their extremely young
audience and created an energy
level that got them “off their
asses” and dancin’.

...grass sellers...downed hoopies
begging for dope...eighty-ﬁve inch
platforms and no breast wait
huggers and boggie moter boogie
to the warm-up records...

Italked to the band before the gig
and had hea_rd their l.p. so I had a
good idea what was going to
happen on stage. Back stage was
something else...lots of beer...you
know...

The album is a little'less than a
live performance...the engineering
could have been handled either
more towards a live sound [take

Something New, Something Communal?

Neil’s After The Goldrush or a
strong studio sound [any of Al
Kooper’s pieces].

The album opens with “Don’t do
that"..it's the type of tune you
wanna grab your honey and jitter
bug to. James Montgomery sings
and plays harp and Peter Malick is
the lead guitarist. On this tune
they dominate with a sense of
rhythm that forgets all aesthetic
qualities.

“I'm funky but I'm clean" is lead
by rhythm guitarist Peter Bell a
rather...well, big dude. The kinda’
musician who lifts roadies for
exercise. Peter adds something to
the band that most groups have
abandoned for who knows what...

real rhythm (and heighth, ha...)

I hate to say it but this band
reminds me a lot of the old Butter
band before the horns. It’s
because of, the Chicagoness of the
people and some of the members
are from the city.

Chucky Purro is a really fine
percussionist--not just a drummer
whotkeeps the musical bread of
life...the beat... but a person who
knows how and what to do with his
instruments and maintain time.

The other portion of the rhythm is
carried by Billy Mather...whata
whiz kid. I couldn't stop laughing
withhim ﬁlling me with Budweiser
and bad jokes. His personality, if
you can believe it, echoes his bass
lines (or'vice versa). They move
from a swing-jazz to funk...pure
funk...to rock’n’roll. Take “Ready
Teddy”. The title itself gives you
the ﬁfties influence, and the
keyboard work adds that touch of
early boppin’; 4

David Case, the keyboard exton-
dinaire, has a personality that
reaches out and soothes you.
“Love is a thing,” a new song, is a
soul gripping funky love song.
Backstage he’ll curl his beard, but
don't let it fool you...he’s a savage
on keyboards!

This band is a tremendous bunch
of guys. Their attitudes off and on
stage is a communal one that
wishes to‘please you. On stage
they’ll play to and for that
audience...if you’re ready to get off

the gig and didn’t say much until I
found out about his macrobiotic
diet...we babbled on. He has such
a closeness about his music and
person...talking about B. B.,

castors. .

Despite all the good things about
this band and one thing I don't
know if they want leaked out. . .what
the.hell...they have a fantasy of

that’s souped_up with a Caddy grill

HARRISBURG AP -- An attempt

l7'to preserve adult access to alleged
pornography was defeated by a
151-37 vote Tuesday as the House
worked on a proposed anti-
. obscenity statute for Pennsylvania.
‘ The legislation, scheduled for
{final House action next week,
’would ban sale, exhibition or
distribution of books, movies or
other material found obscene by a
jury. .
Judges would have authority to
I issue preliminary or permanent
' injunctions against the material
pending a jury decision.

The House approved five
changes in the measure Tuesday,
including an amendment that
‘directs the jury to apply county

standards in determining whether
books. movies. magazines or other
material offend the community.

The House rejected attempts to
make the bill apply only to
juveniles and to provide for
criminal prosecutions instead of
civil legal procedures.

Rep. Patricia Crawford, R-
Chester. a mother of two who has
been crusading against porno-
graphy for more than a year, said
she would try again next week to
make bookstore owners and theater
operators subject to criminal action
for first offenses of the proposed
antiobscenity law.

Her amendment failed Tuesday
by a single vote. 94-93.

The proposal to maintain a

consenting adult's access to porno-
graphic material came from Rep.
Marvin Miller. R-Lancaster. a
weekly newspaper publisher.

MilIer’s amendment, voted down
151-37 after attacks from Mrs.
Crawford and other lawmakers,
would have directed the bill at sale,
display or exhibition of material to
anyone under 18 years old.

“I care deeply about the
personal freedom of adults to
choose, despite the inhibitions of
any aspiring district attorney who
wants to make a name for himself

“I don't intend to impose my
own personal beliefs on my
constituents."

The bill is designed to implement
the new obscenity standards set out
last June by the U.S. Supreme
Court.

The court ruled that material
may be outlawed for sale or
distribution when:

During several days of hearings
in Harrisburg last fall, book
publishers and movie makers
strenuously opposed defining
community standards as those of
the county.

Backing a uniform statewide
standard, the publishers and
producers said havoc would result
from separate standards for each of
the 67‘counties in Pennsylvania, let
alone the number of counties in all
50 states.

At present, each Pitt professor
decides the limits of calculator use
on exams and in labs, and few
make any limitations.

University of Pittsburgh. High-
lighting the Thursday program will
be Igmar Bergman’s Cries and
Whispers, Bunuel’s The Discreet
Charm of the Bourgeoisie and
Francois Truffaut's The 400 Blows.

Pangborn’s Thursday series
opens January 17 with Claude
Chabrol’s Ten Days’ Wonder

Bargaining Unit Position

Fought for by PSEA ‘ 7

(Continued from Page 1)

different universities has tradition-
ally been the only such data
available to Pitt faculty members.
' - \\ ‘\» - :

AAUP President Ray Richman
photo by Wilson

The major difference between the
groups is one of automony versus
afﬁliation. AAUP’s proposed
bargaining unit would be wholly
automonous, composed of faculty
members on leave who would work
full time for the organization.

The decision of the Law School to
exclude. itself from any bargaining
unit will therefore hurt AAUP
most, since Richman admits it will
represnt a loss in legal consel for
the self directed group.

Richman said, ‘iWe don’t want 

any afﬁliation with any existing

labor group in bargaining...l don’t  

think afﬁliation with organized
labor would beneﬁt
versity."

PSEA’s Encinio criticized the 7
AAUP for its inability to “enforce

contracts” because of its smaller ‘

size. He claimed NEA represents
thousands more than any other
organization, and would have the
power to enforce contracts.

He also said NEA is a bargaining _ 1

agent at 90 institutions (15
four-year colleges), as opposed to
25 for AAUP (22 four-year colleges)
and 48 for American Federation of
Teachers-AFL-C10 (AFT) (12 four-
year colleges).

PPU President Hall, whose group '

is afﬁliated with AFT, sees the
main issue as deciding which group

can best represent the faculty to

maintain faculty input into deci-

sions, by the power of collective

bargaining.

“We feel that PPU with AFL-Cl0- '
AFT afﬁliation can provide the -

faculty with more expertise..and
political connection in Harris-
burg,” said Hall.
especially au_tonomous in AFT.

AFT provides a happy medium
between PSEA and AAUP in terms

of local autonomy. PSEA is much V

more bureaucratic, much more
organizational than AFT.”

The bargaining agent, if selected,

will not include faculty from the 

Health Professions, since in the
past labor boards have excluded
medical faculties.

will take the Fitzgerald Fieldhouse

BY BART MACK
ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR
The ball has ﬁnally begun to roll

for the Pitt Basketball team and
now it’s up to Buzz Ridl to keep it
going in the right direction. After a
two week wait. the Pitt cagers have
ﬁnally received national recogni-
tion, being named 17th in the
country by the Associated Press.
Ridl's first obstacle to overcome

floor tonight in the George
Washington Colonials at 8 pm. who
will undoubtedly be out to see if the
Cats will be resting on their laurels.
If you're planning on making the
hike up to the game, you’d better

Better Late
Than Ne ver

BY RON SIEGEL H
sponrs EDITOR

  

It's a little late for Christmas presents and New Year's wishes, but
with the excuse that the Pitt News wasn’t being published then, I'll
do it now. A

To Johnny Majors: A coaching job opening up and your name not
being mentioned as a candidate for it.

To Billy Knight: A well-deserved All-American selection, and a
healthy pro basketball contract.

To Bill Hillgrove: The negative and all the copies of the picture of
your horseback-riding episode that Sports Information Dean Billick is
so gleefully spreading around the city. 7
To gymnastics coach Ig Perez: A victory, or maybe even more than
one.

To Tony Dorsett: A healthy season, because that’s all you'll need to
repeat as an All-American and Win the Heisman trophy.

To Joe Avezzano,'Pitt offensive line coach: A good recruiting year to
replace the graduates from this year's line so that what I said about
Dorsett comes true.

To Buzz Ridl: A high ﬁnish in -the NCAA basketball tournament that
will show the country that a nice guy doesn’t have to ﬁnish last, even in
college basketball.

To Johnny Majors: Finishing in the top ﬁve, going to a big bowl
game, and winning it.

To the other Pitt coaches: The same thing, so you can get more
scholarships than you ever had before.

To Joe Paterno: A two-million dollar contract offer, because I’m sick
of hearing about the million dollars you turned down.

To Jackie Sherrillz Another year at Pitt, but if you have to leave, get a
job where you won’t have to recruit against Pitt.

To coaches Harry Jones and Bob Roper: A stereo that plays nothing
but country music for the coaches’ locker room.

To Jim Dyar, defensive line coach: That your biggest critics should
again be your wife and this ‘reporter.

To Dean Billick: A new office, the same assistants, and

- unfortunately, a revival of the “DLBU" club.

To “Tiger” Paul Auslander: A straight-jacket, to see how long it will
take you to get out of it during a close basketball game.

To Ron “Rodney” Steiner, Assistant Sports Information Director:

9 People to stop confusing you with the sports editor of the Pitt News.

To Vince DiNardo: People to stop confusing you with the sports editor
of the Pitt News. A

To the Pitt Students: A new ﬁeld house next to the new law school.

To baseball coach Bobby Lewis: A rainless spring, so Penn State and
Buffalo can't avoid playing you. ’

To Carson Long: Recognition as the most dedicated and best
place-kicker in the country, which you should be in this, your
sophomore year. .. '

To Sam Nover: Jan Hutchins‘ quitting WIIC and accusing you of
brutality, prompting some sportscaster to repeatedly badger you about
why you ruined his life.

To Harry Jones: A skinny four-pound robin, quicker than a
small-town rumor.

To Panther guard Reynold Stoner: Knowing what it's like to play
football without wearing a shoulder harness. _

,. To Fran Webster: Indoor tennis courts as part of the new ﬁeld house.

To Bart Mack: a hockey rink as _part of the new ﬁeld house.

To Frank Kush, Arizona State, coach: The ridicule you deserve for
letting your son place-kick tor'a major college team, when he does it so
poorly.

To Cas Myslinski: Success in getting Duquesne on the basketball
schedule. so the question of who the best team in the city is can be
clearly illustrated.

To Keith Starr: Stop growing when you reach 7-1, and change your
position from guard to forward.

To trainer Bob Mangini: A diploma, if youwant one.

To Johnny Majors: One more tailback to go with Dorsett, and a
veer-option offense to use next season. .

To the Pitt football team: Air conditioning in the sweltering
Johnstown dorms for training camp, with the only broken unit in the
SID's room. '

V To Wesley Posvar: Johnny Maiors turning down a million-dollar offer

- 1  and signing an extension to hispresent contract, which has four years

 

 

.80-74 and left them 82 for the

will remain the same--first come,
first serve. The JV’s will take the
court at 6 pm against Slippery Rock
and it wouldn’t be a bad idea to get
there for that affair to assure a seat
for the varsity contest. The JV’s
will meet Duquesne junior varsity
tomorrow night at the Civic Arena
before the Dukes-Stuebenville
game. r

Despite all contrary opinions, the
Colonials are not a team to be taken
lightly. In fact, George Washing-
ton is looking for the tournament
bid that eluded them last year.

The Colonials had gone 17-8 into
their last game of the year against
Syracuse, a team that had already
accepted a bid to the NCAA
post-season tourney. A victory
over the Orange would have carried
an invitation to the NIT for GW. A
two point Syracuse win sent coach
Carl Slone’s season efforts down
the drain and the Colonials were
ignored for the post-season affairs.

The Colonials have even stronger
hopes for this season--with four
returning starters and a pair of All
American candidates. Bob Tallent
and Clyde Burwell will lead GW
and both are juniors. Tallent is
suffering from loose cartilage in his
right knee, and injury he sustained
prior to a trio of holiday
tournaments that the Colonials
played which forced him to miss
those games. Tallent, a 6-3 guard
that led GW as a soph with an 18.8
scoring average, presently carries a

question mark over his playing’

potential.

Burwell is a 6-11 defensive
stalwart who averaged 13 points
and 10 rebounds a game for GW
last year. Also returning to the
starting GW lineup are 6-6 forward
Haviland Harper (12.0 avg.) and
6-2 guard.Keith Morris (7.5 avg.).

As Ridlghas said time and time
again, Pitt doesn't have a starting
ﬁve, they have a starting eight.
And Buzz doesn't hesitate at using
anyone. '

“We have good depth and our
players know exactly what their
assignments are when they sub-
stitute,” Ridl remarked. “In fact,
I’d say we have super subs.”

Usual starters have been All
' American candidate Bill Knight,

who has shown a consistency for

coming through with great per-
formances in the big games, and

Mickey Martin, one of Ridl’s most -

consistant players. Both senior
forwards have yet to let their coach
down deeply on any occasion so far
this year.

At guard, Tom Richards and
Kirk Bruce have played well,
taking up the slack to make the
team perform more as a unit. At
center Ridl has started 6-8 junior
Jim Bolla but has used 6-6 Lew Hill
freely as a substitute and Hill has
responded by averaging 11 points a
game.

“You don't have that frustration‘ I
when you have a number of players";

“Mickey Martin was sick at__
Virginia and we were able to sub
with Lew Hill. Billy Krijght didn't. _
score at Davidson like he usually in
does. but Kirk Bruce took up the .
slack. Those are the kind of things
that give you consistency." 
The biggest loss suffered by the-1
Colonials was that of 6-7 forward ,
Mike Battle, who graduated last‘"f

most likely be replaced by 6-5 Greg-
Miller, who starred for the GW.‘
JV’s last year. 
It’ been a few weeks coming, but TA:-1
it's ﬁnally here. Buzz Ridl has 
grabbed onto a notch in the AP Top ___

with a sly grin on his face. All our

Maryland we led the whole day.
Freshman Dan Betterley started off
at a fast clip with everybody just
building. Our 3:22 wasn’t bad

but the competition wasn't there.

A bettefheat would have brought

out better times. The boys didn't
want to run only against the clock."

Asked who he considered his
best runner in the relay, Banner
again smiled saying:

“I can't say. We have seven
good men, all with just about equal
talent who can run the mile or the
two-mile. Our depth helps us very

much. All seven are progressing.
Chuck Mozingo is a good runner.
He was second in the East last year
in the 440 and should do well again
this year. Rick Weaver is another
good man. He's been running
three years in a variety of events
and has been an asset."

Grapplers Off To ‘
Shaky Start

The‘ Pitt wrestling team com-
peted in a four-way "meet last
Saturday in Annapolis, Md., but
was only able to gain a win in one ot
the three matches. They were
torpedoed by the Naval Academy in
the opening match with Rande
Stottlemyer gaining the only,
victory. After aconvincing victory
over Princeton, the squad suffered
their second defeat of the day at the
hands of powerful Oklahoma.

Stotlemyer, wrestling at the 126

slot w-as the only Pitt wrestler to
gain three victories for the day.

Jeff Minerd, wrestling at 177,
copped two victories.

The team then traveled to
College Park, Md. were they were
defeated by Maryland, 29-8. The‘
loss Monday brings the Panthers

record to a disappointing 2-6 mark, ‘

while Maryland now posts a 8-2-1
record.

The team will be on the road
again this week. They will wrestle
in another four-way meet on Friday
and Satruday at Lehigh College.
Oregon State and Indiana State will
also participate in this meet.

Seeing Chuck Mozingo, Banner
called him over while he worked
with the hurdlers. The sandy-
haired soft-spoken Mozingo was
glad the team was getting some
publicity.

“You know we give away points
in some events because. we just
don’t have any men in them. We
have a good team and a fine track
surface but spectator room is
lacking. The schedule is good and
competition is the best there is and
that's the way to prove yourself.
We ran well at Maryland but
nobody gave everything they had.
Kent State on Saturday has a lot of
sprinters and will be a challenge for
us.”

Rick Weaver, Banner’s Mr.
Everything walked over sipping
Gatorade and dodging joggers in
his bare feet.

‘‘I liked Maryland because of the

peted. But our heat was slow. We

Then he added with a twinkle'in*
his eye, “You know, somebody;

V WHEREAS the office and the person of the President are immersedin a sea of accusations
and contradictory denials, and 7

WHEREAS prominent officials of the Nixon administration have been found guilty of high
crimes and others face indictments, and

WHEREAS there is substantial expert judgment that various actions of the President have
violated provisions of the Constitution of the United States such as the power vested in the Congress

to declare war, to provide for the armed forces, and to appropriate funds for Congressionally en- _

acted programs, and

WHEREAS the integrity of the judicial and police powers of the Federal Government have

been debased thereby putting in permanent jeopardy the rights and liberties of all citizens,

THEREFORE, we, members of the faculty and staff of the University of Pittsburgh, call
upon the House of Representatives to initiate impeachment proceedings against Richard M. Nixon
in accordance with the laws as set forth in the Constitution of the United States. We also urge all
members of the University community to speak out on this issue, and as a first step to inform their
congressional representatives of their position on impeachment of the President.

We, the undersigned, are members of the University community who have chosen the
means of this advertisement to ensure that our position is known to the entire University commun-
ity. We do not speak for any others than ourselves. If you are in agreement with this position, please
