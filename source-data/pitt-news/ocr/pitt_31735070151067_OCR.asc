A celebrated virtue of science is its ability to

produce objective results. Interpretation of the

results, however, often breeds controversy»—

especially when the sensitive public opinion of
animal research is involved. I

Such controversy has rocked scientiﬁc cir-
cles since mid-February when The New York
Times published astory aboutascientiﬁc study
— which involved Pitt faculty —— that questions
the usefulness of certain mouse models for re-
search in the understanding and treatment of
three human inﬂammatory diseases. Scientists
across biomedical ﬁelds disagree over how far
to extend the study’s results, and they worry
about whether the millions of Times readers
could ﬁnd within its pages afair interpretation
of the results.

“There’s a lot of discussion after this
[study] ,” said Bill Yates, a Pitt neuroscience
professor who has chaired theAnimal Care and
Experimentation Committee of the American
Physiological Society.

A tale of two articles

The study in question represents the latest’

installment in a long series of academic papers
since 2001 coming out ofthe Inﬂammation and
the Host Response to Injury research program,
a collaboration between 18 institutions funded
by the National Institutes of Health — thefed-
eral funding agency for biomedical research.
Motivated by the failure of nearly 150 clinical
trials of drugs builtto control excessive immune
responses, the study set out to systemaﬁcally
evaluate mouse models of disease from which
the drugs emerged.

Published online in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences on Feb. 11, the
study looked into the activation of inﬂam-
mation-related genes of white blood cells in
response to three conditions: burns, trauma
and a model of sepsis (a whole—body inﬂam-
matory condition typically caused by severe
bacterial infection). The main conclusion: No
relationship exists between mice ‘and humans
in terms of which genes activate in response
to the damage.

Titling their paper “Genomic responses in_
mouse models poorly mimic human inflamma~ .

tory diseases,” the 39 co-authors concluded,
“The prevailing assumption —- that molecular
results from current mouse models developed to
mimic human diseases translate directly to hu-
man conditions — is challenged by our study.”
Online that day and in print the next, The
NewYorkTimes publishedanarticlebyscience
writer Gina Kolata that tried to translate the
ﬁndings in the PNAS‘ paper for a general audi-
ence. In the opening paragraph, Kolata wrote:
“But now, researchers report evidence 
mouse model has been totally misleadingfgér at
least three major killers — sepsis, 
trauma. As a result, years and billions  ol-

lars have been wasted following false 

  NEWS

Mouse study findings prove contentious among scientists

they say.” ~ _

Shortly after the Times article was pub-
lished, anirnal-rights organizations took the
opportunity to speak out against animal re-
search in general.

The National Anti-Vivisection Society ran
with the Times story in its emailer that week,
and the group’s science director, Pam Osen—
kowski, wrote on the NAVS website, “_This
‘game-changing’ study reinforces the message
that NAVS has long voiced: Scientiﬁc evidence
shows that the use of animals in science can
mislead researchers while it wastes valuable
time and resources.”

On Feb. 20, the Humane Society of the.
_ United States President Wayne.Pacelle, who

represents the country’s largest animal-rights

organization, expressed a similar sentiment .

in The Hufﬁngton Post, which, according to
Quantcastcom, reaches 60 million people per

month. Citing the Times article, he titled the .

post “A Scientiﬁc Indictment of Animal Re-

search and Testing.”

Concerns over public impact .
Given the size of the newspapers readership

and inﬂuence, the Times’ presentation of the

results of the PNAS paper worries scientists.
“I think [Kolata] wentway beyond whatthis

paper actually said,” said Cliff Deutschman,

critical-care physician and sepsis researcher’ -
at the University ofPennsylvania, whom 

quoted in the Times article.

“First of all,” Deutschman said, referring to
the Times article’s claim that mouse models in
the respective areas of inﬂammation research
have been “totally misleading” and wasteful,
“you can always learn something from a bad
example.” *

“To suggest that valuable human therapies
have not come out through mouse models is
absolutely false,” Timothy Billiar, chair of the
UPMC Department of Surgery and a co-author
of the PNAS paper, said of the Times article.

Billiar refers to drugs that blockTNF, a regu-
latory molecule produced by white blood cells,
since these anti-TNF drugs were developed in
mouse models of sepsis but proved effective
for human sufferers of rheumatoid 

“Now they’ve gone on to be blockbuster
drugs and have helped thousands of patients.”

The chance that the public may gather from
the Times article that scientistssuddenly ‘real-

ized they “can’t equate” mice to humans also
concerns Billiar.‘ “We’ve always known the
limitations of mouse studies,” he said. “You

cannot make sweeping conclusions based on '
. mouse studies.”

Wenzhong Xiao, a primary author of the
PNAS paper andagenome scientist associated
with Massachusetts General Hospital and Stan-
ford University, said of the Times article, “It’s
not really a faithful portrait of what we wrote.”

Kolata said that her article accurately repre-
sented her sources. The two other PNAS-paper
authors the Times article quoted were not avail-

able to comment on the record to The Pitt News.

 

“I am not a scientist, so I carmot reply to
scientiﬁc quibbles,” Kolata said in an email. “I
spoke to experts and accurately reported what
they said.” ’

MCT CZlIlI|)tlS

The scientiﬁc debate .
 Outside of the ‘media attention, interpreting
the results themselves divides scientists.

For Olivera Finn, chair ofPitt’s Department
of Immunology, the PNAS paper offers little
more than conﬁrmation that mouse models
carry limitations. “The paper provided hard
data forwhatallofus already assumed to be the

case,” she said in an email. “It is easier to argue '

with data than with assumptions.”

Similarly, Billiar of UPMC thinks the well-
publicized PNAS paper pales in signiﬁcance
next to other papers that have emerged from the
Inﬂammation and the Host Response to Injury
collaboration, for which he led a clinical site at
Pitt. For the group’s magnum opus, he points to
a different academic paper published in 2011,

t which found that injury produces a “genomic

storm” within white blood cells.

‘ “A small subcomponent of [the NIH fund-
ing] was meant to address the comparison with
mouse models,” Billiar said.

But it goes beyond institutional context for ’

Billiar, who did not edit the PNAS paper. He
thinks the article may have overstepped itself
in interpreting the data.‘ A I

For one, “I don’t think the title serves the
paper well,” he said, similafly criticizing the

paper’s discussion section, where results are -
interpreted. He doesnft think these parts ad- _

equately reﬂected the paper’s own limits.

One limit is the difference in subjects — the
study only used one mouse strain, whereas hu-
man samples were pulledfrom heterogeneous

populations (not controlled for age, race, pre-

existing conditions, etc.). _
“We’ve known that mouse responses vary

[considerably by strain,” Billiar said, “Some

pitmews.c_om.

. [strains] would exhibit responses closer to hu-

mans, some would exhibit responses different
from humans.”

Nonetheless, Xiao said, the study chose the
speciﬁc strain because it was the one “used in

this particular ﬁeld” during its long history of «

developing drugs that failed.

Deutschman, who would have preferred
more “rigorous” gene activation assays than
those used in the study, emphasized that the
results apply narrowly.

The study’s conclusion is “legitimate up to a ‘

point,” he said. “It’sIlegitimate in talking about
global white-cell behavior; It’s not legitimate
in talking about lung, liver, heart, brain and
anything else.”

Deutschman thinks it’s an important ﬁnd-
ing that “one organ system — the white cells
— doesn’t behave the same way [in mice as in

humans] ,” but that “‘doesn’t mean that in one
subset on the white cells, that you won’t see
homology there,” he said.

Deutschman also noted the difference

I between endotoxemia, in which the subject’s

immune system responds to a single part of
a pathogen experimentally injected into the
bloodstream, and human sepsis, which occurs
in patients who often have real infections and
other medical conditions. The study focused
on the endotoxemia model of sepsis. :
“Endotoxernia is not correct,” Deutschman
said. “The best model. [of sepsis] is cecal liga-
tion and puncture.” Deutschman refers to a

method of inducing infection by puncturing ‘

the mouse’s colon.

” . — But again, Xiao — a primary author on the
PNAS paper — asserted the relevance of all
models considered inthe study, including endo-
toxemia. “Those were the popular models that
were used in the ﬁeld of inﬂan1rnation,” he said,
referring to the models that produced the 150
failed clinical trials of sepsis drugs.

“What we’re trying to say here is that the
current animal models need to be careﬁilly re-
examined,” Xiao said. “We think a lot of stud-
ies so far maybe conveniently sidestepped this
issue.”

Going forward

“It won’t change my research practices at
all,” Billiar, who works with mouse models in
inﬂammation research, said of the PNAS paper.

But that’s not because Billiar clings to an
equality between people and laboratory ani-

. mals. “Mice aren’t really models — they’re as-

says for very speciﬁc mechanistic questions. ‘

They really representthe mammalian response,
but not a human disease,” he said.

Others see a need for a more aggressive
transformation of the ﬁeld of inﬂammation
research, without giving up animal models.

“I think there’s a lot of value in questioning
the relevance of these animal models,” said;
John Kellum, professor of critical-care medi-

’ cine at Pitt.

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Nate Barnes
Senz'07‘Staﬁ Wrz'ter

For the last time as a member of the
Big East conference, the Pitt men’s
basketball team will welcome cross-
state rival Villanova to the Petersen
Events Center. Adding meaning to

Sunday’s contest will be the celebra- «

tion of Senior Day, which this season
means the celebration ofDante Taylor
and Travon Woodall’s careers.

“For me, it’s deﬁnitely going to be
emotional. I’rn excited. I can’t wait.
I know it’s going to be a big game.
There’s going to be a lot of people
here. I’m just going to come out and
play well as hard as I can,” Taylor said
after Wednesday’s victory over South
Florida. “I’m happy my family’s able
to come out, especially with it being
the ﬁrst time they’ve been able to
come out and watch a game [at Pitt].
That part’s really big. I can’t wait for
[Sunday .” _

No. 23-Pitt (22-7, 10-6 Big East)
enters the contest having won two
games in a row, victories that were
much-needed after the team dropped
two consecutive contests to No. 22
Marquette and No. 21 Notre Dame
in the middle of February.

But Villanova (18-11, 9-7 Big East)
has an agenda of its own, as the W1ld-
cats trail the Panthers by a single
game for sixth place in the Big East
conference standings. Additionally,
Nova will look to exact revenge on

No. 23 Pitt, Villanova tface ff i nior Day clash

Sunday after the Panthers beat the
Wildcats 58-43 on their home ﬂoor

injanuary.

The sixth—place seed in the confer- .

ence tournament is coveted highly
by schools in the middle of the Big
East packbecause it affords thatteam
not only a ﬁrst—round’bye, but also
an opening game against one of die
conference’s bottom—dwellers.

As Pitt needed to do entering last
weekend, the Wildcats have to get
back on track with a victory Sunday
after losing to Seton Hall, 66-65,
Monday evening. The stakes are
high for the visitors from Philadel-
phia, as the time to select the NCAA
tournament ﬁelds draws closer, and
Villanova looks more and more like
a bubble team, unsure of whether it
will make the ﬁeld of 68 or not.-

Lookingforward to Sunday’s con-
test, head coachjamie Dixon seems
pleased with the level ofplaythe Pan-
thers brought Wednesday night in
their 64-44 win over South Florida.

“I watched the ﬁlm of our game,
and I really liked how we played,”
Dixon said. “Especially the defense,
Ithoughtitwas very good allthe way
through, all 40 minutes.”

I Villanova’s offense features a pe-
rimeter-based attack that Pitt saw
ﬁrsthand when it played at The Pa-
vilionjan. 16, notably in the form of
Darrun Hilliard’s 12 ﬁrst-half points,
which came off four 3-pointers. Vil-

forward Jayvaughn Pinkston, who
averages 12.7 points per game along
with 4.8 rebounds. Anchoring the
Wildcats in the paint is senior cen-

ter Mouphtaou Yarou, who leads the
team with 7.6 rebounds per game
alongside 9.3 points per game.

But the real strength ofVillanova’s

attack comes on the perimeter, with

' the aforementioned Hilliard putting

up 11.6 points per game while fresh-
man point guard Ryan Arcidiacono
averages 11.8 points per game and
more than six 3-pointer attempts. -
For the Panthers, Woodall leads
the team in scoring (11.5 points per
game), as well as in assists (5.1 assists
per game)‘. Pitt also will need to rely

s on the efforts of] ames Robinson and

Lamar Patterson to neutralize Vil-
lanova’s perimeter threats.

Playing well against Villanova is
something Pitt must do to continue
to get better and help the Panthers
play their best basketball at the best
possible time as the season comes to
a close, according to Woodall.

“We want to make sure guys are
playing to their best level,” Woodall
said. “I think, as a team, we’re doing
a real good job of getting back to the

4 defensive mindset, number—wise, and

we want to make sure going into the
tournament and going into the post-
season that we are at our best.”

For Woodall, Senior Day repre-
sents a chance to just go out and play
with his teammates once again.

“It’s deﬁnitely a day to look for-
ward to. I look at it as, you know, we
get another chance to play another
game, get another chance to go out

and get another victory,” he said. “It

gives me another chance to play with
the guys and it’ll probably be an emo-
tional day.” I .

BEGIN YOUR ADVENTURE
HERE

 

ou’re a_senior trying to get that ﬁnal OCC credit —
that ﬁnal feather in your college cap of self-motivated
well—roundedness. You open up your OCC dashboard

l and see two items that will fulﬁll your. “sense of sel ”

category. One is an ice-cream socialin Litchﬁeld Tow-
ers. The other is a pizza social at the Cathedral of
Learning.

Are you pizza, or are you ice cream?

     

  
    
 

. Pizza? 11 Ice Cream [> 10

t’s another Tuesday night in Nordy’s, where you
and your Student Government Board colleagues hear
student organizations ask for a slice of the Student
Activities Fund pie before you andfthe Board vote on
whether or not to give it to them. It’s usually pretty
uneventful, but tonight is a special occasion. Nordy
himself is in Nordy’s tonight, rambling on about col-
lege students, their love of free pizza and a plan to
take students onthe experience of a lifetime for OCC
credit. He says he has already.selfrﬁ1nded a majority
of the trip, and only needs, $2,009, for cup holders,

_food and water. .

Do you vote yes or no?

 

    
   
   
   
     
      
   
     
    

ou’ve only come into The Pitt News office to pick

up a voice recorder and want to get out before one of _

your editors catches you and gives you something to do.

As you’re waiting at the elevators, almost hom_e—free, -

your editor walks out of the bathroom and sees you.

V “Hey, you’re covering Pitt Dance Marathon tonight, i
right? We’re looking for a _newVSGBevbeatwriter. You
‘want to shadow the beat writer now attonight’s SGB

meeting? See what it’s like?“

Pizza. Q 8

The pizza party at the Cathedral is in the Ethiopian room. You’re having a good      

time, despite the uncomfortable chairs. There’s just one problem: no one has
swiped you for OCC credit yet. At the very moment the thought crosses your mind,
Chancellor Nordenberg enters the room with a big «smile on his face, “Aw, look
at you college kids with your pizza — like moths to a ﬂame. Anyway, before I can
give you OCC credit, I need to weed out the people who just want the green cord
from the people who want to actually earn it. If you want to earn your OCC credit
and the opportunity of a lifetime: stay. If you don’t want neither, take your
pizza and go.” - R ‘

You vote no. With such a crazy idea, Nordy reminds you of your crazy uncle. When | Q s ' u N G

Yeah, sure. If you become the SGB beat writer, you can take fewer assignments and
get a steady $5 per week for the meeting recaps. Turns out it’s really boring, though,
even if Nordy shows up with some crazy idea and gets denied funding by SGB.

You’re back at the office, writing the article with the current beat writer, when
the editors ask you to go back down to Nordy’s to talk to a few of the Board mem-
bers before they leave. You head down to Nordy’s and see the member you need
to talk to leaving. You ask the question and the Board member responds, “You
must be the future beat writer. Come to Hem’s with us and we can talk there.” Do
you go to Hem’s? A “

You walk toward the new student lounge, pretending you’re interested in this new devel-
opment since you lived in Towers. Actually, you just want to sit on the couch. As you sit,
a blanket of nostalgia falls upon you. Threeyears ago, in one of these very couches, you
saw two people wrestling under a big denim jacket, or so your freshman mind thought.
Now, you look up at the new generation of ﬁrst—year collegians enjoying their ice cream.
They all look so young, and you feel so old. You envy those freshmen. Your envy becomes
enlightenment, as you ﬁnally realize what’s really in store for you after graduation. As you
slurp some of your melted ice cream, you make a mental note to visit the career services
office on the second ﬂoor of the William Pitt Union. Your future is uncertain.

You go, because youjust want the green cord and another lineon your resume. As you’re
walking down the stairs, you start to feel faint and dizzy, which is strange because you
ate a lot of free pizza, but not that much free pizza. You remember a story you heard
about bad pizza at a house party. Your hand goes numb and the pizza you’re carrying
tragically splatters on the ground. You bend down to salvage what’s left, but the world
goes dark. You dream of a green cord dangling in front of you, always just out of reach
as you try to grab it. Eventually, you just shoot the person dangling the green cord, and
it falls around your neck. But, for some reason, you can’t feel it against your skin, as if its
material is lighter than air. A T

group of people gathered in the center around some commotion.

You accept. You follow the president toward the back of Hem’s against the grain of people
leaving after last call. The bartender starts turning lights off. As you and the president get
closer to the back, cut through the kitchen and go down a short ﬂight of steps, the soufi’E:l
of bestial cheers and roars gets louder. You both enter a large, dimly lit room with a large

The president leads you through the crowd. You notice it’s composed of the rest of

before. You ﬁnally make it through the crowd to see The Pitt News’ new SGB beat writer
doingthe stone—co1d stunner on the WPTS news director. The president turns to you and
says it’s your ﬁrst night, so you have to ﬁght. Right now, you’re hoping they make it a fair

Yes. You reach into your pocket for some sand and then throw it in your opponent’s eyes.
As your opponent is trying to clear out the sand, you go for the knees and initiate a sleeper
hold. The crowd begins cheering “Sand! Man!” as your opponent hits the ﬂoor.

The president congratulates you on your victory. “Consider yourself an honorary
member of our mega—slate. I was hoping you’d make it to our side, so now I can give you
the vaccine for the zombie virus we’ve released into Pitt Dance Marathon. We’re going to
need someone who ﬁghts as dirty as you in the coming days. See, we want to make Pitt
the best college ever, so we’ve released an extremely contagious form of zombie juice
into Pitt Dance Marathon. After we’ve contained the virus ourselves, with your help, of
course, the Pitt students will have more Pitt pride than ever in the history of Pitt. And
then Pitt will become more than just a “Public Ivy.” It will be the only public school to be

ranked higher than all the Ivies. I hope you don’t ﬁnd our methods  unsound.” Do you

A person in a red bandana peeks out from a door up ahead and tells you to follow

too easy. You feel a momentary pang of guilt, which quickly fades away when you ask one
freshman to give you a nostalgic tour of a Towers room. The guilt comes back later that

night, though. The guilt morphs into a realization that this ice—creamIsocial shouldn’t be .
worth an OCC credit, because it’s not really preparing you for life outside of college. You _

THE END.

hope career services has something better in store.

Yes Q 13

You voted yes. A tall, skinny guy from the men’s Ultimate team walks into the ring to
face you. The president offers you some juice. You take a long swig, then start cautiously
moving in for the kill. Before you’re even 3 feet away from him, though, your opponent’s
long, disc—catching arms have grabbed your head, pulled it into his sharpknee and tucked

you infor the night. ' _
’ THE END.

G9

Dancers Q. 10

The dancers. You jump into the crowd for some immersion reporting. You make a mental
note of how things are especially dark and sweaty, and how this (one dancer seems to
be getting especially close to you, even though you don’t knowthis person’s name. You
decide this dancer is going to be your ﬁrst interview. You lean in close and ask, “Hi, I’m

. a writer for The Pitt News. Can I ask you a few questions for my article?” The dancer re-

sponds by taking an uncharitable bite out of your neck. You take out your voice recorder
to document yourﬁnal screams- “ ’
’ ‘ TH E END.

Interview Q 14

You’ve had your share of tough interviews, so this one should be no problem. But
these interviewees won’t stop dodging your questions with grunts and groans. So,

‘ you break out the “gotcha” question. They don’t like it at all, but they do like the

taste of your ﬂesh.

THE END.

“Follow Q 15

You follow the person. He locks the door behind you and begins barricading it.
You notice he has several nerf guns strung over his back — those ones used in the
Humans vs. Zombies club. He tells you that you’re in the service tunnel to Trees
Hall, where the club has set up a base of operations. The group can’t hold Trees Hall
forever, though, and are outﬁtting a 10A shuttle for a trip down to the Cathedral,
which will be much easier to defend and has more food and water. Do you join
them or stay at Trees Hall? ‘

Join them '9 19‘ Stay at_ Trees I> 18

Stay <J 11

You stay because you’re still hungry and want to eat more pizza. Nordy starts yam-

. mering excitedly about his “legacy at Pitt and in the stars,” a new Pitt satellite campus,
how ,“his own people didn’t want to help,” and how he was hoping the new Nationality _

Rooms would make for more passengers. So, he’s just going to go on without them in the
Cathedral of Learning that is now the “Nordy V” rocket. You’re only halflisteningbecause
chewing a mouthﬁil of pizza is surprisingly loud. Nordy begins handing out space suits
while apologizing for his use 0 “unsound methods.” You start feeling slightly faint and

dizzy, but conscious enough .to want to_ do exactly as Nordy says. He tells you to don the ‘
suit, and your body moves to_ do so. As he’s strapping you in, he leans in and over a faint, ‘

competing rumble whispers into youriear, “I’m sorry, but this was the only way. Even
though you stayed, I couldn’t know for sure that you wanted the OCC credit that I’m
about to give you.” With everyone drugged up, suited up and strapped in, Nordy takes
a seat and hits a big red button on his armrest. The rumbling instantlyvbecomes all you

;can hear. Gravity pushing down becomes all you can feel, even on your eyelids. You black

out, only to snap your eyes open to the sight of that little blue marble. You get a sense of

how small you really are — how small and insigniﬁcant your daily nonsense is. Not just
yours, though, but the whole planet’s. There are no political parties, borders or cliques.
There is only the human race, and all it has is the planet Earth. Nordy takes one look at
your astounded face and ﬂoats you a green cord.

Don’t Q 14

No, but your opponent does. Your opponent throws pocket sand into your eyes,
then puts you in an arm bar. You tap‘I-but, but your opponent breaks your arm
anyway. Then you pass out. ' F ‘

%4 ‘rd 1 THE END.

Run past  15

You run straight past him, but the undead mob doesn’t. You turn a corner and see .
a ﬁre exit at the end of the hallway. Thescreams behind you get quieter as -you run .

tpward the exit. You excitedly throw yourself through the door, glad you made it
out alive. The party,-though, has moved outdoors. Students with frothing mouths
are chasing students without them. You’re screwed no matter what.

THE END.

They’re unsound  15

You do. They let you go scot-free, because nobody is ever going to believe what
you just went through. 1 -

THE END.

Stay at Trees  16

You stay at Trees Hall, because you don’t feel like covering the story anymore.
You’re probably going to getjﬁred, butithat doesrft matter. There are much better
things to do than write a bad article for a mediocre‘ student paper .—— like getting
in one ﬁnal swole before the end of the world. The mob is banging at the door to
the gym while you’re on your ﬁnal rep of benching two times your body weight.
You’re past 10 on the RPE scale, struggling to push the last one. The sound of the
door crashing down is better than anything a trainer could say. - 1 C

Accept. You could use a drink, especially after sitting through that meeting —— and
sitting in The Pitt News office for more than ﬁve minutes. You follow the Board
member into the back of Hem’s, expecting to see a reserved table. Instead, you’re
led through the kitchen, down some stairs, and into a large, dimly lit room. A good
number of Board and committee members are already there, along with some
strangers. They’re removing shirts andshoes and stretching. The Board member
leads you into the center of the room, and tells you to get ready for that comment
for the story. -

“Everybody, welcome to Campaign Club. If this is your ﬁrst night at Campaign
Club, you have to ﬁght.” Looks like you’re going to have to ﬁght, but who? The
WPTS news director enters the ring, because TPN and WPTS apparently have a
friendly rivalry going on. The news director looks like a ﬂimsy hipster, so you can
probably take this person in a fair ﬁght. The only question is, do you want to
make it a fair ﬁght? ' ‘ ~

Join them  16

You join them. You ride the 10A to the Cathedral with Taylor Swift blasting through
the speakers. You’re decked out in nerf guns and a red bandana. You interview a
fellow passenger, who shares that he’s in Free the Planet. “This is all thanks to
fracking,” he says. You promise to look into it, if you ever make it out alive.

When the shuttle arrives, the violent mob is already there. It has already gathered
around SGB members, who must have had the same idea about the Cathedral. You
and the rest of the club rush outof the bus and toward the nearest entrance. A good
number of dancers notice your group and start running after you. The nerf guns
somehow work against the dancers, enabling your group to make it to the door.
Before you can make it inside, though, the ground below you begins to shake,‘ and
the Cathedral starts to rise toward the sky. The air starts to heat up. You look at

the pavement and you can see smoke rising from the cracks. In the next second, a '

massive explosion, intense heat and burning, then nothing.

THE END.

You don’t. The man is crazy, but he has a point. You reach out for a handshake, and »

he gives one heartily. You can’t help but feel a small part of yourself dying, though,
as if his hand is sucking out who you once were. '

kill, ‘performing a lst?one—cold,stunner — stunning them cold. The. crowd cheers s_

you on as you soak in the victory. V
The Board member you needed to talk to takes you aside and gives you the
quote you needed. You’returning around to leave but remember you had one more
question. The Board member is gone, though. Did the SGB member vanish into
thin air? Did you just interview a brick wall? Maybe you were talking to yourself. ‘
