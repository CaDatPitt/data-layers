Middle-Income Students‘Borrow More

Congress LiftsCeiIing on Income

By JEFF COUCH

Pitt News Staff Writer
Federal legislation changing the

income eligibility for interest-free .

students loans has led to increased
borrowing activity by Pitt students,
according to Daniel C. May,
associate director of student aid
operations. -

The Middle Income Student
Assistance Act, passed last year by
Congress, eliminated the $25,000
adjusted income level—the max-
imum level of income a. student
could earn under previous legisla-
tion and still qualify for a loan.

From July 1 through Tuesday,
Pitt’.s Office of Student Aid

processed 3,019‘interest-free loan,s
Last year,
5,595 students received a total of
$11,193,467 in loans, May said.
Elimination of the income, test
has resulted in more student loan
applications from middle and upper
income families, according to
reports A from the Pennsylvania
Higher Education Assistance.

must assume responsibility for
paying interest after this period, in

May said that as guarantor,
PHEAA is responsible for. repaying
any loan defaulted by a student but
PHEAA documents claim that last
year some lenders said funds for
the students loans would “dry up”
unless they received a higher
return on their investments. D"

SAAC. Hears $1 0.5 Million Plan

For Schenley Hal|Restruc,turing

“By TOMKUKUCKA

Pitt News Staff Writer
A $10.5 million renovation
plan to convert Schenley Hall
“from hotel to student union”
was presented to Chancellor Posvar
and the Student Affairs Advisory

Committee yesterday. _

.‘ Using the present student union
as a base, the uiiiversity plans to
expand the structure in a ;“Time-
phase project,” meaning work will

most likely take place ﬂoor by ﬂoor, ;

thereby keepingthe student union
functional during the renovation
process.

 The expansion would provide
more space for a recreation center,
publication/media center, a 4,000
square foot “organization area’? for
student government committees,
and‘ large lounge areas for
commuters.

Terry Milani, Associate Director
of Student Activities, said a “very
optimisitc projection’’_ for the start
of L the project would be next
summer. Milani said a more exact
estimateis impossible because of
contingencies involving engineers
and architects.

At the same time, Milani said,
funding for the project has yet to be
determined. Funding for

‘renovations could take various
.' forms: ’ ~

—a student union fee, which
would be a separate’ item on
student invoices, an amount not yet
determined -

——money from the state alegis-
lature. Posvar indicated there is
little chance for ther state to grant
Pitt additional for such a project

——gifts and grants. Again, very
little can be expected to be
generated-form alumni and friends
of the university.

—-increased tuition. ‘The “bill”
for the renovation would be
included in future tuition A esti-
mates. ‘

“This (the renovation project)
will be a part of our funding
campaign,” Posvar said. “We can

-at best hope to get only a fraction of

' what we are asking.”

Milani has indicated in the past
that both the student union fee and
inclusion of the renovation costs in
student tuition would be the more
feasible alternatives. ‘Most likely,

the projectyvill be funded to some
degree by state appropriations,
students, altfmni, “and the uni-
versity itself. 1

“You have to realize that
virtually all‘ the things we have
been talking ‘about will be

‘ that had been placed‘-on a special -

completed after you graduate,”

‘Posvar told studewnt leaders at the

committee's first meeting of the

year. 'We are really working for the A

future students. _

The renovation plan will undergo
additional scrutiny by virtually all
student organizations before it is
approved by Vice Chancellor for
Student Affairs Conney Kimbo, the
Student Affairs, Advisory VCom-
mittee and Senior Vice Chancellor
Jack Freeman. Freeman has the
power to veto a Kirr’1bo/ committee
go-ahead.

In. other business, Student
Government Board members Cindy
DeMatteo and Kim Watterson
announced the formation of the
academic_affairs committee and the
expansion of the board’s public and
governmental relations committee
to include local lobbying aifd more
trips to Harrisburg.

Participatio

By KIM GORDISH

Participants in a panel discussion
about security held yesterday in the
Kurtman Ballroom of the student
union stressed the role of students
in maintaining safety on and
around the Pitt campus.

Director of the Office of Resident
Life Joann Woodson, Jackie Rack

. of the housing office, Lt. Charles

Westbrook of the campus police
and Betty Hughes of Pittsburgh
Action Against Rape all said
student participation in any secur-
ity program is essential.
Approximately one quarter of a
million dollars was spent for
renovations, which limited stair-
well access to resident ﬂoors,
re-timed elevators, added an

A additional entrance to the mailroom

and a luandry area on the lobby
level, Rack said.
$250,000 is spent annually for
security personnel, she added.
The majority of desk attendants

, are students, Rack said, and those

wishing to become one must ﬁll out
an application asking for ‘two

  

 

f

s

references, must participate in an
interview and if hired, go through a
one week training period.

Fulltime attendants are referred
to the housing office’ by the
university personnel office._

“We are basically trying to tell
students that their security is most
important and_that we need their
cooperation,” Woodson said in her
introductory remarks.

She urged students to excort
their guests at all times, and to lock
the rooms to their doors whether it
is empty or occupied.

-Woodson -added that crime
prevention tips and statistics are
posted around campus for student
information.

Concerning the new 24-hour
security policy, Woodson said .“If
student are unhappy with this, they
have the option of living off-
campus. _

Hughes disclaimed any apathy
on the part of students toward
rape. . _
“We want people to believe that
this. crime can happen to them,”
she said, also listing situations in

urged purchasing a “shriek

Like previous speakers, West-

to share the responsibility for your

Approximately 92 emergency
phones are located around -thé

Chairmen: Lack of Interest
Causes Course Cancellations

By ROBIN L. LUBIC
/.

Lack of interest ‘caused the
majority of class cancellations this
fall, according to university depart-
ment heads.

“We schedule enough elective
courses to give people choices, but
it seems very few want the-
electives. They would rather have
required courses,” said Patricia
Pond, chairperson of the "Library
Science School. . .

_ Departments with the highest
number of cancellations are Eng-
lish (20), Library Science (9) and
History (10), according to figures
released by the registrar’s ofﬁce.

The. departments are not cancel-
ing courses because of a drop in
department enrollment but be-
cause there are five persons or less
registered for a course.

Linda Tanis, an administrative
assistant in the Library Science
School said, “The real problem, lies
in the fact ‘that schedules are
prepared in advance. Right now

The English department also
uses previous term ﬁgures to

' Dr. Ed O’Chester, chairman of
the English department, doesn't
‘believe that there is a problem with
course deletion but rather with
closed courses that leave some
students out in the cold.

“This problem could be alleviat-

with the tight economic budget Pitt

“Not only did they cancel a
course for my major, but they
didn’t even send ‘me notice until‘ a
week before school started. Surely
they knew before that,” said Jeff
Jobes, a senior.

“I'm mad because they cancel-

experiencing difﬁculty with in-
structors and teaching assistants
who lack proﬁciency in spoken
English. '

' A program designed to eliminate
such problems, currently centering
around teaching assistants, is in
operation. ,

The task force on faculty
proﬁciency in spoken english,
headed by George H. Shames of
the speech and theater arts
department, made a report in
December of last year to the
University Senate. '

The task force's objective was to
“ascertain whether a problem of

and to “make recommendations to

the University Senate Council and
to the Provost as to ways in which
this situation may be ameliorated.”
Figures compiled in the task
force report show that 61 percent of
96 participants in a “linguisitics
interview test”—-designed to show
the level of english proﬁciency-
had superior scores.‘ '
Last January the University
Senate, after little debate and only
minor corrections, adopted the task
force report and authorized imple-
mentation of its ‘recommendations.

 ,   Signs of Hope?  
, e   From  
C  Popular Front

With the agreement of Patriotic Front leaders to
the agenda for the constitutional conference on Zim-
babwe Rhodesia, the London talks among'Britain,
the Popular Frontiand Bishop Abel Muzorewa’s
government have taken a significant step forward.
The front’s leaders, Robert ‘Mugabe and Joshua
Nkomo, decided to discuss the constitution first, in-
stead of demanding action on elections, a cease—fire,
a new military, administrative arrangements and the
maintenance of law and order during the transition
to a new government. ' -'

Page 6—Friday, Septemb_er 14, 1979

Nkomo always have sought a great deal of in-
volvement for themselves in any new government,

' but Smith and Muzorewa probably will be very un-

willing to be generous about the guerillas’ role in any
-Zimbabwe government. .

Since Smith and Muzorewa will be unfriendly to
attempts to give Nkomo and Mugabe significant
power in any new government, it is the responsibility
of the British government, and the United States
government working behind the scenes, to pressure
Muzorewa and Smith to ‘be more receptive to

Q‘!

Popular Front demands. Nkomo and Mugabe both
represent sizeable constituencies within Zimbabwe,
and it is foolish to exclude them from a meaningful

" role in the government because they have resorted to
violencein the past. Although their acts of violence
cannotbe condoned, they are understandable in the
face of the long refusal of Smith to allow any par-
ticipation by blacks in Zimbabwe’s government. ,

Whatever the outcome of the constitutional con-
ference, continuation of the present status quo can-
not be accepted by anyone. Under the current con-

, stitution a white minority holds one-third of the seats

' in the Zimbabwe legislature, and controls the army,

. police, judiciary and other important parts of the
national administration. Any new constitution must
give blacks, who are the overwhelming majority in
Zimbabwe, representation in the legislature that

Can Administration’s Security Campaign Be Serious? .

 

THE ONLY THING FUNNIER THAN OUR SCHEDULE IIS JOE PATERNO‘S NOS/E. - ‘ ' ‘~

A lot still is ‘being written regularly on W '

the rape and murder of Monica Jones.
Now it is written in reference to increased
security measures in the Towers: the-
implementation of 24-hour security and
the relocation of the laundry rooms.
University administrators. it seems, have
become “security conscious.”

However, 24-hour security was never a
demand of students. Instead, Pitt

‘s students demanded that the university

shut down unguarded access routes into
the residence halls. They also asked for
such things as dollar bill change
machines to be installed in Lothrop so
that the person behind the window could
concentrate on checking l.D.'s. In

-addition, they organized voluntary

self-monitoring systems, an escort
service for both black and white sutdents,
and self-defense demonstrations and
lectures.

Students were the first to be concerned
about security. Pitt never supported any
of these things. It chose to make cosmetic

- changes and increase the presence of
, police. They tell us that if we cooperate,

the university will protect us.

Can anyone take this seriously? Last
June, the University Times reported that
Trees Hall would have to be closed to
eliminate the threat of airborne asbestos

falling from the ceilings of the gym and

pool. Asbestos is known to cause cancer.
The university, with all its top
researchers, knew this since last March.
but waited for four months before telling
anyone.

No word was given until the, majority of
students were away, operating by the old
proverb. “What you don't know won't
hurt you." (Asbestos hurts whether you
know it or not.) Maybe the
administration didn't want to inconven-
ience anyone by having to cancel
However. anyone
with cancer will tell you that chemo-
therapy is quite an inconvenience.

It seemsthat security itself is an
inconvenience to Pitt. Last July. at

university worker was “inconven'ienced."

Member of the A nti-Imperialist Student Union

In the basement of Crawford Hall, a

._pipeline carrying contaminated water,
including radioactive waste, had been
leaking. On July 27, the worker was
ordered to clean up the water before
anyone from the Radiation Safety
Department could sample and test it.
Later. it was ‘found that among the

‘ contaminants in the water was radioactive
iodine. whose effects have been linked to
thyroid cancer. However. at this very
minute, Pitt's top researchers are seeking
the cure for thyroid cancer. "-

The University’s method of dealing
with security shifts all of the burdens ahd
inconveniences to students and workers,
overlooking the fact that Pitt itself is the
source of many dangers. For instance,
what did the construction of the Forbes
Quad have to do with the safety of women
and the prevention of rape? The Quad's

stairwellsi and ‘maze-like room -lay-out

thought was ‘given for human concerns.

You can’t even turn off the lights without

shutting off the entire building.

Last summer when the university
suffered power-outages in many build-
ings, staff workers were issued ﬂash-
lights and ordered to continue working.
Where was Pitt’s security then? Were
staff people trained to defend themselves

‘with ﬂashlights in dark corridors'and'

basements? It seems that safety always
takes a back seat to the uninterrupted
operation of the university. .
But, if people can’t take the
university’s, “security consciousness”
seriously, perhaps they will respect the
police. After all. that is why the police
are here—to make you respect the
university. While the administration
trots out its black cop to apologize for
everything. the police continue to beat
and harass people in front of the Original.

To Pitt. security mean’s security-for-Pitt. 
not for people. As Posvar prepares to, '

‘embark upon his Capital Campaign. we

wonder if any of this money will go to
BlackiStudies or Women’s Studies to

, research the causes of rape.

The‘ Public/Governmental Rela-
tions Committee of the Student
Government Board will strive to
develop a “professional” image
this year, according to chairpersons
Jeff Miller and Martin Bertocchi.

The professional approach in-'

cludes widening the scope of the
committee’s action and its training
program. .

The group will lobby strongly in

support of a pro-tenant landlord bill

expected to be introduced to the -

-state house Business and Com-
merce Committee sometime this
fall, Miller said.

“Too many students across the
state are getting ripped off by
people who rent,” he said.

Bertocchi said PGR is concerned
,about the apartment issue because
it “involves 30 percent of Pitt
students.

“We’re trying to get a concerted

effort going,” he added.

The committee will enhance its
public relations by becoming
involved in more local activities,
the Chairpersons said, including’
expanded work with People's
Oakland, a community coalition.

A “walking tour” of Oakland to
familiarize residents and students
with aspects and problems of the
area is tentatively slated for Sept.
27, Miller said. '

PGR will attempt to develop.

what can be called a first-‘name
relationship with state legislators
to facilitate representation of
student views.

PGR wants legislators to base

any decisions on “what the
students are, not what the
administration is . . . to start

having contact with us,” said
Bertocchi. 

The committee’s operating bud-

the city’s past experience in

said Mayor Frank Rizzo.

The mayor, a Roman Catholic,
emphasized that the Archdiocese of
Philadelphia will supply all the
religious accoutrements, including
an altar and throne, that will rest

But that has not satisfied the
American Civil Liberties Union,

that it had been used as a maze.

City Solicitor Sheldon Albert said
Thursday he had talked with ACLU
officials about the threatened suit.
Asked what the upshot was, Albert
replied, “Me making sense, and
them not.”

He said he told the ACLU that
the city was building a platform
which it would do for" any other
head of state. He described it as
‘ ‘a normal governmental activity.”

“I don't see why the pope should
be treated differently than any
other head of state,” Albert said.

Asked why the city just didn’t
accept an offer from the archdio-

answered, “You don't demean the

A labor union also has offered to
build the ‘platform free of charge.
However, City Managing Director
Hillel Levinson said Thursday the
offer was turned down because the
city “didn’t want to set a

NRC Official  

Doubts Ease

To Evacuate

By The Associated Press

HERSHEY, Pa.—Harold Den-

ton, the federal ‘official who
calmed the fear of Pennsylvariians
during Three iMile Island, said

Thursday the accident has changed

his views on evacuation.
“I have had some doubts about

“ the extent to which we sould rely on

9!

evacuation, the Nuclear Regu-
lator.y Commission official told a
radiation‘ and health conference
sponsored by Penn State Univer-
sity. .

“Before TMI I thought. evacua-
tion was relatively simple. Every-
one would just jump in their cars
and leave. ‘But some elements of
the population need much more
attention.” 7 ,

.Denton said ‘members of the
Amish
Three Mile Island told him they
didn’t know of the accident at'the
time it occurred, and would be

unwilling to leave their farms in ‘

any event.

He also commented on the
logistics of evacuating nursing
homes and hospitals. He said
medical officials advised him 700
ambulances‘ would have been
needed to evacuate medical facil-
ities in the area, but only 14 were
available.

“Evacuation has to be the last
resort,” Denton concluded. The
accident has prompted the NRC to
tighten licensing, design and
emergency preparedness require-
ments, he said. .

In addition, Denton said the
accident produced “a remarkable
turnaround” in the nuclear in-
dustry.

“For.the first time, they’re all
cooperating with each other,” he
said of the utilities ‘that own and
operate nuclear plants.

“They've set up institutes, for
operator safety. They're funding
big research projects. Now for the
first time they’re all working

I together attempting to improve the

‘ are planning an ambush.

play a football game at Pitt Stadium
tomorrow afternoon. An aura of
mystery surrounds the game. Pitt

' is gunning for at least 10 wins and a

major bowl bid", while the J ayhawks
They

. were 1-10 last year, and new coach

Don Fambrough has said, “We just
may be a little better than most
people think.”

Such reasoning is understand-
able enough, because Kansas is a
member of the Big Eight Confer-
ence, probably the roughest league
in the nation, and playing a steady
diet of Oklahomas, Nebraskas and
Colorados has instilled the Hawks

I ' with the intestinal fortitude to play

a top-20 team. (Translated; don’t
expect the Kansas players to fall to
the turf ' after noticing alf those
national championships Pitt has

won. courtesy of the stadium wall.) I

/

What does Pitt have to do to beat
Kansas, and how could the

' Jayhawks pull off the first big upset

of the young season?
For the Panthers to win, they will

have to score more points than

Kansas. Simple enough? But to
score those points, Rick Trocano
and Dan Marino will have to keep
mistakes at a minimum, and try to
keep the Kansas defense on the

field for long periods of time. Not

only, will this give Pitt’s two
quarterbacks ample experience in
learning the newly installed’ l-For-
mation, but it will give the Panther
defense a chance to do something it
didn’t get to do last year—relax—
for a while the offense tries to win a
few games.

But when Kansas has the ball,
the Pitt defense should be’ up to the
task of containing the Jayhawks.
Pitt coach Jackie Sherrill has
indicated that Kansas likes to put
the ball in the air, so the Panther
defensive front should be able to
work on‘ its pass rush to rattle

I
I

sophomore quarterback Kevin
Clinton.

There seems little doubt about
the quality of Pitt’s defense. The
Jayhawks aren’t likely to score_ too
many points, in spite of injuries to
Pitt’s one starting linebacker, Jeff
Pulusi, and strong safety, Carlton
Williamson. 0

' Anotherareaof concern is the-

free safety ‘position, where Mike
Christ will be making his first
collegiate start. Barry Compton
‘should also see action at that slot,
and if the coaches are displeased,
cornerback JoJo Heath could move
to free safety, and Terry White

would move, into Heath’s vacated A

cornerback position.

But most of the attention during
the season has been on the offense.
Sherrill has said he will use a
t_wo-quarterback system, but it
might not matter who’s calling the
plays if Pitt’s'pass receiving corps
isn’t healthy or talented enough to
catch the ball. ' ’ .

Kenny Bowles, who has never
caught a pass in a major college
game, and Ralph Still, -who has
caught 13, will probably start
Saturday. ' The most gifted

' receiver, freshman Julius Dawkins,
has been hampered by a thumb

injury, but should see action. It’s

only a matter of time before he

steps‘ into the starting lineup.
After playing behind Steve

‘Gaustad for two years, tight end

Benjie Pryor is anxious to'~show
everyone why he "was considered
one of Pitt’s most prized recruits
from Valley High School three
years ago. Pryor has always been a
good blocker, but some have
questioned his hands and -his

eagerness to get popped by two,
defensive backs after catching a ,

ball over the middle.

Here's how" the Panthers should
line up for tomorrow’s season
opener at 1:30 p.m.

Qn offense, Trocano will start at

0 quarterback, with Fred Jacobs at

halfback and Randy McMillan at

Tough Competition Set as Spikers Head West

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News Asst. Sports Editor
Representing Eastern volleyball
is a tough assignment, but the
Pantherette spikers are doing just
that while on a, 10-day tour of
California and Hawaii.

“The team is really excited,”
said head coach Mike Hebert.

“We feel as strongly about-

repr_esentir'1_Ig‘the east as we do
about representing Pitt.”

“The east‘ and west have had
little competition in the past,” he
said.
contest.” V

The Pantherettes played their
first game late last night against
Southern’ California, and are in
Hawaii today to ‘compete "against
Brigham Young-Hawaii. Results of
the USC game were not available at
presstime.

After" a two-night, two-match
series with BYU, Pitt will play
similar contests with Hawaii-Hilo
and the University of Hawaii, third
in last year's national champion-

Hawaii’s coach is an old team
mate of _Hebert’s, and that will add
to the spirit of’ competition between

‘ the teams,‘ Hebert said.

‘ two successive nights,

‘ ‘Out there (Hawaii), we will play
” he said,
“and ‘we’ll draw four” or‘ ﬁve
thousand people for a dual match.
A crowd like that is almost unheard
of in eastern volleyball circles.”

Hawaii, according to Hebert is
awesome, and could very Well
improve on their third-place finish,
nationally. The Rainbows will have

’ two players back from injuries who

didn’t compete last season.

“It’s a regional credibility‘

“But, we’re by no means going
out there to lose,” said Hebert.
“The gap between the level of
competition in the east and west is
closing, and with this trip, we hope
to close it even more.”

Following their tour of Hawaii,
Pitt will compete in the 20-team
San Diego State Invitational. The

Pantherettes will be in a bracket
with Arizona, UCLA, Texas and
Fresno State.

’Ten Pantherettes made the trip,
and almost all have had some
previous national competition.
Junior Nancy Zentner was forced to
leave the team due to academic
pressures.

“We have had a short time to
prepare, but should be able to
adjust for anything. anyone throws
31 US," said Hebert.

According to the coach, Pitt’s
appearance at last year's nationals
and their 13th-place ﬁnish, along
with this year’s west coast, tour
should have helped his recruiting

Paula Olsen and the rest of the Pantherettes hope to spike their Western toes on a tour which began last night.

  HOLY ERDOLICS!

‘HP makes professional scientific colculoiors students can oﬁord.

49 program lines of fully merged keycodes‘; .a I

Bet that bit of news really elevated your
equations! Hewlett-Packard, the people who
make some of the world’s most dynamic calcula-
tors, now makes models just -for your needs
and budget—Series E. .

' Wow! The first one is the HP-31E

dazzling array of program control keys; arid 8
user memoriesi Never again shy away from a .

sinister calculation!

And listen to this: every Series E calcula-
tor comes with a new larger, 10-digit display

Scientific, now available at a NEW LOW PRICE
——$50.* It’s a real corker of a basic scientific
calculator. It has all the trigonometric, exponen-
tial and math functions you need most. Not
only that, it handles metric conversions. And if
that's not enough, it has both Fixed and Scientific
display modes and 4 separate user memories.
Want more? Then take the HP-32E
Advanced Scientific with Statistics, also at a
NEW LOW PRICE——$70.* It's everything the
HP-31E is—and more! More math and metric,
comprehensive statistics, decimal degree conver-
sions, Engineering/ Scientific/ Fixed display
modes and 15 user memories to boot. Sufficient
to handle any “would-be” brain busters!
And now, for those who meet the
challenge of repetitious riddles, problems, and
scientific equations——the HP-33E Programmable
Scientific! Likewise available at a NEW LOW
PRICE —- $90?‘
Amulti—faceted scientific, math and
statistical calculator with the added punch of
programmability. It gives you at your command:

with commas to separate thousands for easier
reading; diagnostic systems to help you catch and
correct errors; a low battery warning light;
rechargeable batteries and more.

, Surely, there is a Series E calculator that
is right for you. Which one? I suggest that you
stop by your HP dealer for a “hands-on”
demonstration and a free copy of “A buyer's guide
to HP professional calculators? For your
dealer's address, CALL TOLL-FREE 800-648-4711
except from Alaska or Hawaii. In Nevada, call
800-992-5710. Get your HP—and solve another

one for freedom, ingenuity and correct answers! .
