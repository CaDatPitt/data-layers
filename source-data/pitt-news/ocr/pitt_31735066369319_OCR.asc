Wecht Optimistic of Support
Despite Office Fund Investigation

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staffwriter

Allegheny County Coroner Cyril
Wecht and Allegheny County
Commissioner Thomas Foerster
will “optimistically” continue to
seek the Democratic nomination for
county commissioner, despite a
full-scale investigation by County

‘Controller John Lynch into a
private bank accountmaintained by
Wecht. ,

Funds for the account were from
payments for autopsies done by
‘the coroner’s office for other
Pennsylvania counties.

The audit, which was authorized
‘by Commissione" Robert_ Peirce
and Foerster, will try to determine
whether the fund is legal and
whether the money in the fund is
public or private.

Wecht has maintained through-

Maxine Bruhns, director of the

inspect the rooms.

Damaged were the Swedish,

Italian, English, French, Russian,»

Lithuanian, Polish, Norwegian and
Chinese rooms. Bruhns said an
indelible substance was used to
scribble an obscenity in black and
red in and around the rooms.

An inspection revealed damage

The English room suffered addi-
tional damage on the wall above a

Damaged also were ‘six hand-

personally benefitfrom the money
in the fund. Wecht added that the
fund was established originally
under the administrations of his
predecessors, William Hunt/’ and
Ralph Statler.

Hunt has denied there was any
such fund maintained by "him for
the coroner’s office.

Wecht added that the fund was
established in the best interest of
the office of coroner, to buy items
that the yearly budget «did not
provide: ,

“I will cooperate fully with the
audit being conducted in conjunc-
tion with the D.A. ’s'ofﬁce,” Wecht
said in an interview after an
Allegheny County Democratic
Committee workshop held yester-
day in Pitt's Student Union.-

,“Although I am sure/ that the

records will bear out what I have
already stated as the purpose of
the fund.” ‘ ‘

Wecht stressed yesterday that he
did not gain personally from the
fund other than reimbursement for
professional expenses ‘for educa-

SGB Reports
D i Orientation  
Revisions

" .« By JEFF:COUCH~v

The summer freshman orienta-
‘tion "program may undergo
changes, according to a report
delivered by Student Government
Board member Diane Behers at the
Board’s Friday meeting.

Behers said that one of the
changes will be in the \intervisita-
tion rules. Current regulations do
not permit students to visit

in their dormitories. .

current rules are unfair
unrealistic. “It seems ridiculous to
me that if you make friends you
can’t visit them,” she said. “We
believe orientation should prepare
students, as much as possible, for
university life.” i ‘
Another ‘change would be to
move the date of orientation from
Juneto August. Behers said the
date change will help those
students who have summer jobs.;
“It is easier for people who have

summer,” Behers said.

SGB member Jan Medoff dis-
cussed the possibility of offering a
one-credit course speciﬁcally for
freshmen, dealing with college life.
Medoff said that freshmen would

Admissions Steps Up Recruitmet Despite Budget

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Admissions Office has
stepped up its recruitment drive for
next year despite the University’s
continuing budget crisis, according
to new Director of Admissions,
Joseph Merante.

‘‘I don’t word recruit-
ment,” said Merante. “It denotes
a negative attitude, so we'd rather
speak in terms" ‘of identiﬁcation.
That is, being able to. proﬁle
students who did come to ‘Pitt and
let the ,_.high‘ school students

compare their needs and wants to,

those students.’-’ . . L

-The director of admissions, said

Merante, was originally“more of a
gatekeeper who only opened and
incoming
students.

“Today, that philosophy has

changed,” he said. “We try to be
warmer, more caring and more
concerned with the students’
needsf’ A

The Admissions Office inter-
views 25 to 30 students a day,
Merante said, conseling them
about attending Pitt and in what
programs they may be more
successful. -

There have been some real
changes in the whole admissions
process. For instance, there has
been a drastic change in publica-
tions. Merante said that the printed
material should reflect the Univer-
sity itself. '

.“All of our publications have
changed,’-’ said Merante, “and
we’ve added some that we never
had before.”

The Search Program of the
College Board sends out a

chairsiin the French and Russian
rooms._ A handmade brick wall in
the Swedish room was defaced.
The vandal also scribbled on
classroom change notices posted
outside the rooms. A

.Bruhns said she could not
speculate who did. the damage and
said she believed the vandalism
was a reaction to authority and not
an attack directed at the nine

nationalities represented by the

.1'O0l'l'lS.

Repairs, which she stated would»

be costly because of the integral

work necessary to maintain the-

authencity V of each room, are
scheduled to begin at 5 a.m. this
morning.

“This ispthe first time in 41 years
that this has happened,” Bruhns
said, noting no damage of this
extent has occurred since the
opening of the” rooms.

interviews in the

pamphlet entitled “The Reach of
Pitt.’ ’ If a student indicates interest
in Pitt, he receives a booklet with
all the general information about
the University along with an
application for admission. There is
also a pamphlet geared towards
minority students.

There are also pamphlets dealing
with the University Honors Pro-
gram, choosing a major, and the
possibility of taking courses at Pitt
while still attending high school.
One unique‘ piece of printed
material, according to Merante, is
a pamphlet entitled “To the
Parents of a Fledgling.”

“Parents have a great deal to do
with where their child attends
college,” Merante said. “Most
admissions offices forget about
parents, except when it comes time

to pay the bills."

   
   

   

Although the German room was not dela
other nationality rooms in the Cathedral suffered damage.

Another change in the admis-
sions process is the availability of
staff to interview students and
accept students’ questions over the
phones.

“Our reception area is staffed by
paraprofessionals who are trained
to work with students both in
person and over the phone,”
Merante said.

One of the biggest changes in the
process is the fundamental use of
letters to students, comparing the
strengths‘ of certain academic
departments to those of other
universities, according to Merante.
Another function of the letters is to
des/cribe academic life and financial
aid, and to give a general overview
of the University as a whole,
Merante said.

The admissions office maintains
a policy of sending representatives

ced by vandals this Saturda

y, nine
Srakocic photo

   
    

to high schools in New York, New
Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, Ohid
and West Virginia as well as
Pennsylvania.

All of this extra time and effort
has lead to some good results,
according to Merante. This year,
freshmen applications are up 23
percent from last year. Due to a
step-up in transfer student recruit-
ment, the number of transfer
students into the College of Arts
and Sciences has doubled.

The Pitt Host program also plays
a major role in the admissions
procedure. According to Merante,
the Pitt Hosts are a select group of

students who give tours to high ’

school seniors and their parents.

“The high school students and
their parents get to see real live
students,’ ’ Merante .. said. ‘ ‘They
get to ﬁnd out ﬁrst hand about
food, classes and security.”

Merante said that the recent
security problem has had little or
no effect on prospective students.

“Actually, we’ve had more
questions asked concerning the
room lottery than the murder,” he
said. '_

“We at the Admissions Office

are based more on counseling or 

guidance,” Merante concluded,
“to get the students to understand
themselves. Recruitment comes on
its own.”

officials. He said these charges
were a ploy by members of the local
press and politicians to mar his
name.

County regulations make it
illegal for county equipment to be
stored off county property without
_ county
commissioners. Allegheny County
Commissioners never approved the

’ storage of the equipment from the

coroner’ss office at Duquesne. ,
Wecht leveled charges against

1’ /The Pittsburgh Press for sending a
i reporter and photographer to the

Duquesne site without securing
permission from the university. He
added that the existance of county
equipment in the Duquesne lab has
been public knowledge for years.

“For a paper to make this its
headline—to send a reporter and

photographer onto university pr0- «

perty without permission and for
them to run when questioned by
campus security personnel—-I think
actions such as these should best
be left to the days of J. Edgar

question even at this point is ‘What I’

were they after and where are the
news implications in this?”’

he does not believe the allegations

Yesterday, at the opening
ceremonies of the committee
workshop he received a standing
ovation.

“The reponse, in light of the
events of the past weeks has been
fantastic—-phone calls and letters,
from people, black and white. This
was very meaningful for me—to
see this many people moved by the
issue so much that they would write
letters or _ make "phone calls,”
Wecht said.

Wecht’s runningmate, commis-
sioner Thomas Foerster, said
yesterday that he would not run for
the position» of county commis-
sioner if _Wecht were not his
running mate.

“I have full faith‘ and trust in Dr.
Wecht’s personal integrity and.-also
in Controller Lynch’s correct
analysis of ‘the Wecht fund.”

’ Foerster refused to comment on
the media coverage ofithe charges

‘but added that he did not doubt
that some political figures Would-

take the opportunity to capitalize
on these charges to gain ground in
their campaigns.

“This would be an unfair
confrontation,” Robinson. a former
political columnist for The Pitts-

in the media can disseminate
information that can destroy. I can
only hope that cool heads prevail on
both sides during this investiga-
tion. ’

Robinson said that he did not
voice support for or against the
team of Wecht and Foerster.

“Dr. Wecht and Tom Foerster
are very’ much committed to the
Democratic Party and have pro‘ven
that they are winners,” Robinson
said. “But the Democratic Party is
much more open this year, which
makes the appearance of new-

“It is up to the older members of

ALook  
In the Mirror I

It is not a good newspaper that propels itself into
its columns, and we take little pleasure in placing an

t . affair that involves The Pitt News‘ in an editorial,

since rarely will news demanding such attention be
good. ' ”

But we believe it necessary to bring to the attention
of as many Pitt News readers as is possible a problem

we see overtaking the horizon. The problem involves '

the direction of this newspaper, and from what
source the impetus driving any change will come. ‘

It would be simple to hang this piece of ink-soiled
linen in a Schenley Hall closet and attempt to con-
tinue a private course toward the goals any
newspaper should embrace. But, knowing ’a strong

and independent voice only canfaid‘Pitt—and hoping .

those who would benefit :frorn¥i;$u_-- a grge&spaper.will
share out concern that v:itA—.be .—_a; ;. 3f7tof:e$tit“j’*here—we

are taking this space i’to‘-air the issue of where I

authority and responsibilityat Tl§e"Pitt News rest.

We believe a basic requirement of a good student
newspaper is that it be directed bystudents. This
direction precludes blatant censorship, which is
clearlyia dying difficulty in this country and which
has not been encountered at this newspaper in some
time. It also includes student-supplied answers to
questions that do not directly affect editorial presen-
tation but which are intimately linked to reporting
nonetheless.

The Pitt News receives virtually no help from Pitt’s
academic department. This is not as we would wish
it, but it is an arrangement with which we can live,
and perhaps prosper. I

More assistance comes from other University sour-
ces, and, while we always appreciate criticism and a
helping hand,we fear any arrangementthat does not

stress our ability and right to make and implement

decisions.

Each student who works at The Pitt News has a
desire to excel similar to that of nearly "everyone.
But it is difficult to perform well for an organization

that will not--or can not—promote excellence. We
believe the difficulties associated with producing a
regularly published newspaper, tied to certain
problem particular to The Pitt News, can encourage
an atmosphere in which “getting by” is the goal and

1 improvement a dream. We fear this a much as we
, sense it. ‘ ‘

. The best student.ne_\vs,papers in the country--those

‘ whichserve read'ers,..-stfaffiand journalism most faith-

fully-—are »t_"hbse.7w'hose actions and direction are
governed'by_ responsible students. We plan to move
forward in the future and we hope to have your sup-
port as we attempt to place The Pitt News in ;*
position from which it can satisfy its readers, its staff
members and the ideals without which there would be
no cause for continued publication.

Cottam ’s Theories on the Shah and the Iranian Situation

In an interview that appeared

recently in the University Times,

Professor Richard Cottam char-

-acterized the Shah of Iran as a .
‘tyrant and his regime as cruel and
. despotic, conclusions with which I
heartily agree‘. However, he then -
. went on to view with approval and

anticipation the replacement of the

- present secular compromise gov-
, ernment with that of an “Islamic
Republic” which would be more,

attuned to the needs of the people.

It would be governed by the
spiritual and moral principles
espoused by Ayatullah Khomeini,

who he epitomized as a fighter for T

human rights and likened to the
“rabbis and’ ministers”,who were
so influential during the struggle

I for the implementation of the civil

rights of black people in our own

. country.

Though no expert on Iranian
affairs, I, like my sisters and

brothers, have. had to become an_

expert on. religious and ethnic
persecution that has now lasted
over a period dating back to

approximately 680 B.C. As such I
would like to take issue with

‘Cottam on two counts. _
Ayatullah Khomeini’s creden-

tials as a moral and spiritual leader
and thevprognosis for human rights

in any government over which he

will have influence can,be
evaluated by reference to the
following passage t§‘1E‘!ll from the
english translation of Khomeini’s
book entitled “Islamic Govern-
ment.” 4

This passage appeared in the

January 5 edition of the Washing- I

ton Post. “Before us we see the
Jews making a mockery of the
Koran. It is our duty to reveal this
treachery and to shout at the top of
our voices until people understand
that the Jews and their foreign
masters are plotting against Islam
and are preparing the way for Jews
to rule over the entire planet.

“I greatly fear by their own
special methods they will indeed
realize their desired aims. In
Teheran, Christian, Zionist and
Bahai missionary centers issue

1 their publications

in order to
mislead people» and _to alienate
them from the teachings and

principles of religion. Is it not our

duty to demolish these centers?”

My second." consideration stems
from Cottam’s use of, the term
“Islamic Republic”. Webster
deﬁnes republic as a state or nation
in which‘ “supreme power rests in
all of the citizens entitled to vote
and is exercised by representatives
elected directly or indirectly by
them and responsible to them.”
The governments of the world in
which Islam is the state religion are
by and large a collection of despotic
tyrannies that perpetuate economic
servitude for the many and
enormous privilege for the fewby
a racist, sexist, discriminatory
application of religious dogma and
distract the political attention of the
deprived populace by raising and
maintaining the red herring threat
of Israel, triumphant.

The contempt for human dignity
and rights inherent in these
theocratic states can be gauged by

the fact that within the few years
subsequent to the establishment of
the state of Israel, almost 1 million
Jews, inhabitants of Iraq, Syria,
Yemen, Egypt, Morocco, Iran and
Turkey voted with their feet to the
extent that they and their descend-
ents now constitute 60 percent of
the Israeli"popula_tion.
Parenthetically-, it should be
noted that the progenitors of these
Jews as well as of their European
brothers and sisters had once
before in the 16th century been
forced to vote with their feet after
having been subjected to the
tender ministrations of a number of
Christian theocracies, notably
those -in Catholic Spain, Italy,

France and England and in‘

Protestant Germany.
To expect*that any government

born-of organized and entrenched

religious evangelism, .whether‘«.

rooted in Marxist, Moslem, Chris-
tian or Jewish Orthodoxy, will
provide a vehicle for social justice,
human rights and the brotherhood
of man is to disregard the lessons

' of history. - I '

Without trying to patronize
Cottam (though nonetheless suc-
ceeding), I would suggest that he
illuminate his conceptual under-
standing of Iranian affairs in the
light of selected readings from

Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin‘ ._
and David Ben Gurion on the "

separation of church and state.

  NewRoom Lottery
‘Ridiculous’.Game , »

I have been close to the
University of Pittsburgh since I
entered as a freshman in 1954.
Never have I heard of anything as
ridiculous as' the new room
assignment system. “Lottery”
certainly has become a buzz-word.
I expect next to hear that course
grades will be assigned by picking
a normal distribution out of a hat.

This incredulous procedure for
on-campus room assignments is
the easy way out because it gets the
housing office “off-the-hook” for
making decisions. While in the

’ first analysis, the lottery selection’
system will give all students an

equal chance at getting as room, it
places an undue hardship on those
students who live a great distance
from the University}

Commuting from Brentwood was
a way of life for me, but nowadays,
there are far too many students

The overcrowded dorm situation
should be more fairly treated by
giving room assignment preference
in direct proportion to home-of-
record travel distance.

When I was at Pitt (1954-1958), ‘I
never had a course cancelled. I
never had to juggle my schedule. I
was never told belatedly of unusual
prerequisites for required courses.
All these things are now common-
place and what hurts most is that
out-of-state students pay twice as
much tuition for this kind of
treatment. A

High Quality Education and ‘First Class’ Teachers

Recently, CAS Dean Schulman
was quoted in the University Times
as saying the University has made
“a tremendous effort to assemble a
ﬁrst class, scholarly faculty, but
that effort is not matched by the
quality of the student body we have
assembled.” This needs, to be
discussed, because it certainly
represents - the thinking of a
number of faculty in the University,
whether or not it is an accurate
quote which reflects the‘ true

I I ‘feeling of Dean Schulman.

Students, parents and legislators
must understand that when uni-
versity people (administrators and
faculty) speak of high quality or
first class faculty, they mean as
researchers. I am certainly willing
to concede that the University has
made an effort in recent years to

~rec-ruit a first-class research

faculty. Whether or not this effort
has been successful is another
matter of debate (although not in
this letter). But to juxtapose a
statement about the research
characteristics of the faculty with ‘a
statement about undergraduate
students is a little like the mayor of
a city saying ‘‘We’ve made an
effort to buy a lot of modern
garbage trucks in the last few
years, but the buses still don't run
on time.”

Let me be more speciﬁc. The
mathematics/ statistics department
has been deeply involved. in the
recruitment of first class re
searchers at the full professor ‘level
for the last six or seven years.
But of seven of our most productive
(in terms. of research papers
produced) senior faculty (six of
whom havebeen recruited in the

‘ last seven years), only two have

taught, are teaching or are
scheduled to teach undergraduate
courses during Fall or Winter
1978-79 or Fall 79-80. This means
these seven faculty members
(whose combined salaries probably
represent 25 percent of the

department’s budget for salaries)
are or will be teaching four
undergraduate sections to a total of
approximately 40 students during
three semesters. What‘ possible
inﬂuence can they have on the
quality of the undergraduate
student body? The same effect that
garbage trucks have on buses?
In fact, it is worse than a benign
effect. We are left with calculus
classes of 40 to 50 students taught
by inexperienced (but for the most
part conscientious) graduate stu-
dents, and with Math 3 classes (the
very place where students need M
special attention) taught in mass‘
lectures of 400.

In addition to the lack of contact
of our senior level faculty with
undergraduates, there is a’ great
reluctance on the part of some
faculty (I can only speak of my
department) to spend the time
which is necessary for effective
undergraduate education. For
example, we have classes -where
students are supposed to learn
what a mathematical proof is and
how to construct proofs. ” But some
professors‘ will not collect and
grade homework because it takes
too much time to grade 20 papers a
week. Some will collect homework ‘I
and just note that it has been
turned in. There has even been a
case (so the story goes) of a student
who accidently handed in home-
work for another course and
received an A in the homework.

Some junior level faculty (assis-
tant professors) feel so much
pressure to produce more research
that they feel they are risking their
careers if they take the time to
carefully correct homework, pre-
pare coherent lectures or, en-
courage students to seek their help

9 during ofﬁce hours. Then everyone

complains that the students don’t
measure up. I

I am not accusing the senior
faculty of being less than a very
hard working group. They do work

extremely hard. All are involved
with highly complex research
problems. Most teach one-half or
even one graduate course a
semester. Some direct one or more
graduate students in Ph.D dissert-
ation work. ‘

But students, parents, faculty,
administrators and legislators must
address the question of balance.
It is clear from the first part of this
letter that many of our first-class
faculty do not want to teach
undergraduates. In addition,
many of those who do teach
undergraduates are not willing to

put in the time to do a good job.
Some can’t even get to class on
time. Where do we go from here?

Many former students have
come to me to complain about the
quality of the teaching in some of
their classes. I can only tell them
this: try to choose your instructors
carefully. If you get someone who
is doing less than an adequate job,.
document your case and then let
someone higher up know about it.
Talk toithe chairman, to your dean,
if necessary to the chancellor and to
your state legislators. The faculty
will not change otherwise.

Since I first composed this letter.
I have seen a copy of the
Undergraduate Academic Review,
which contains a very interesting
letter from Provost Rhoten Smith.
It is not hard to see from this letter
that the administration is willing to
condone quite a bit of teaching
incompetence in the name or
academic freedom and high quality
research. Perhaps the first place
students should take their
problems is to the legislature.

Suppressing Ideas at Pitt

The Young Socialist Alliance
agrees with and supports the
Anti-Imperialist Student Union in
its exposure of the role the police
are playing by attempting to
supress Iranian students in Pitts-
burgh. The arrest and harassment
of Iranians trying to ‘get out the
truth about the events in their
country and to stop any U.S.
intervention there is criminal. The
right to freely express one’s ideas
is a basic right, one that millions of
Iranians are exercising every day in
the streets, in the face of machine
guns.

It is also one of the best aspects
of the American revolutionary
heritage. As the case of the Iranian
students at Pitt shows, however,

when the ideas expressed conﬂict .

with those of the people in power,
the right of free speech can
disappear. 7' ’
Unfortunately, at Pitt the police
are not the only ones trying to
supress differing ideas. On Friday,

A member of Workers Viewpoint
Organization, which dominates one
of the African Liberation Support
Committees in this country, told
the socialist member not to sell the
paper, made a number of physical
threats and then grabbed a copy of
the newspaper and ripped it up.

The Young Socialist Alliance has
been involved in the movement for
the liberation of southern Africa
nationally and locally. At Pitt, we
participate in and built the Pitt Out
of South Africa Coalition, a group
attempting to force Pitt to sell its
holdings in companies that. do
business in South Africa.

Within. this ‘organization we
sometimes have political dis-
agreements with Workers View-
point Organization over the stra-

tagy and tactics that the movement
should take in order to build the
broadest and strongest ‘ anti-apar-
theid movement. The course‘ of
events and a free and open political

discussion will determine what_

strategy is correct. ~

Physical threats, force and the
ripping up of rival political
newspapers, however, have no role
to play. These tactics go against
all traditions of democratic and
freedom struggles. Such tactics
play into the hands of police,
provocateurs and other govern-
ment agents.

Strong-arm methods are the
weapons of reactionary institutions
that fear political discussion and
they should be condemned by all
supporters of democratic rights.

Searching for Causes of the Enrollment Decline     - 

So long as the search for causes
of the enrollment decline conﬁnes
itself within the bounds of the
campus, blindness to conflicts in
the society to which the University
attaches’on every side creates a
vacuum only a witch hunt can fill.
Blaming poor attitudes toward
students, and blaming poor atti-
tudes of students are ﬂip sides of
one of those divide-and-conquer
coins which ensure that rip-off
victims never tackle anyone head-
on except each other.

' Calling our faculty “inexcusably
poor” is inexcusable nonsense, and
arguing that it adopts an “elitist
grading philosophy” with “mali-
cious intent” is paranoid fantasy,

because students grew fat and lazy

In so doing, we would link our

‘Discriminating ’ Policy at Pitt Book Store .

I am writing about a question-
able policy used at the Pitt book
store, which discriminates against
students. Namely, I am concerned
with the policy that requires a note
from a teacher before a book can be
returned. It seems many Pitt
professors order books they do not
use, or they, just make mistakes on
their book orders. As a result, the
book store has chosen to place the
burden of the mistake on the
student.

When I was trying to return a
text I was told that it was not
possible to do so unless I had the
professor’s signature or a with-

My point is this: why should the
student he inconvenienced because
of someone else’s mistakes. In
most cases the student has bought
a book in good faith and should be
treated acordingly, not sent all over
campus seeking a note.

If Pitt teachers are not living up

then let them deal directly with the
teachers themselves. Students

Book prices are high enough

‘West Side
Story’   Well

By MARY ANNE KUTCHER

West Side Story
Directed by Lehane Gregory
CMU Drama Department

“West Side Story,” currently
playing at the Kresge Theatre,
combines singing, dancing and
acting to form a most enjoyable
musical.

It is a powerful tale of two
teenage gangs ﬁghting to be
number one on the west side of
Manhattan. Amidst all the hatred,
Tony (Brent Barrett) the idol of an
American gang, the Jets, meets
Maria (Carol Burt) ,a Puerto Rican
and falls in love.

Because of their physical appear- 4

ances, Barrett and Burt lack the
ability to portray convincing
characters. Barrett has a whole-
some Ron Howard image that
makes it hard for one to believe
he’s capable of getting angry, let
alone capable of committing
murder. A '

Burt, with her “Miss Teenage
America” image, just does not
make it as an immigrant Puerto
Rican ghetto dweller. Their singing
abilities, however, pull them
through the show,‘ as both
appeared with the Civic Light
Opera last summer.

In the opening scene, the two
gangs dance onto the stage. The
leaders of the gangs, Riff (Alex-
ander Beresniewicz) of the. Jets,
and Bernardo (John Maldonado) of
the Sharks, are strong, forceful and
convincing. They are no doubt the
strongest characters in the musical.

Bernardo is in love with Anita,
played b.y Julia Pollitt. ‘Everything
from her hand movements to her
facial expressions to her total body

movement is done perfectly. She is’

indeed a most impressive actress.

Since rock’s birth in the early
1950s, television has generally not
been very fair to it. It has either
ignored it or sugar-coated it. For an
example of this one needs to look

Anita helps Maria throughout the
play until near the end when she
tells a lie, which ends the romance
between Maria and Tony.

Doc (James Harvey), who runs
the neighborhood drugstore, helps
Tony after he has murdered
Bernardo by letting him hide in the
basement of his store. I‘-Iarvey looks
as if he’s forcing himself onto the

monotone and then drags himself
off again. . *

Destroyers Back
To Basic

Rock’n’Roll it

By SAM ROSSI
Pitt News Staff Writer
Move It On Over
George Thorogood and
the Destroyers

_ Rounder

Along with many of their
contemporaries, George Thorogood
and the Destroyers are returning to
the bare essentials of rock ’n’ roll
and rhythm and blues. There are
no frills here, just gutsy guitar and
vocal work that forms the mainstay
for an assault on rock ’n’ roll.

“Move It On Over” constitutes

the second release for Thorogood‘

and the Destroyers. What’s pres-
ent here is anything but pop music.
The performances are as spontan-
eous,

The group consists of Thorogood
on guitars and vocals, Jeff Simon
on drums, Billy Blough on bass and
percussionist Uncle Meat Penning-
ton.

The first track on side one is the
title piece, “Move It On Over,” a
Hank Williams tune handled
capably by Thorogood. It’s a good
opening number because it show-
cases Thorogo0d’s basic fun
approach to music.

“Who Do You Love” follows.
This tune goes back ‘a bit in time,
written by rock legend Bo Diddley.
Thorogood lays down some tight
guitar lic_ks_ that make this cut
particularly appealing. ‘

“The Sky Is Crying” is a blues
number made particularly effective
by Thorogood’s hard-nosed vocals.

Next is “Cocaine Blues.” The
tune was made ‘prominent by
Johnny Cash and the vocal
phrasing is similar to his approach.

I New Theater Group Offers Interesting Fare  

By MICHAEL McCABE
Pitt News Staff Writer

Friday night, the Fine Line Theatre Company
opened its second production, “3 by 2, a Romantic
Revue” at the Lion’s Walk on North Craig Street.
The program features short works by contemporary
American playwrights Robert Patrick and Tom Eyen.
Each of the three works focuses on some aspect of
male-female relationships. The wry tone that carries
from one piece to another further links the three.

The main piece, “What Is Making Gilda So
Grey?" centers on the disparity between the
imagined ideal lover and the real person that/one
must settle for eventually.

Gilda (Bonnie Gilmore) and Franco (Robert Koch)
run across one another in a bar. Each mistake the
other for his or herdreamelover. When they
embrace, both realize their mistake and break away,
displaying their disappointment with insults and
disgust. 3

This action recurs several times in different
scenes. Gilda and Franco are sketched in farcical

- terms with rather amusing effect. Then, towards the

end. the tone turns somber in an apparent attempt to
attach some greater signiﬁcance to the story.

lt’s very difficult, if not impossible, to take Gilda
and Franco seriously after they have been drawn in
such a ludicrous fashien. Gilmore and Koch give it a

humor throughout most of the play serves to weaken
the ending that much more. The fault lies not in the

performers but in “Gilda” itself.

“Pop People,” a shorter skit that opens the
performance, is not marred by any attempts at

“seriousness.

"Pop People" contrasts the grandeur of past
spectacles, exemplified by a 1940’s backstage
musical, against the mood and films of the Sixties.
It parodies both, but shows affection for the splendor

and magnificance sought after in the past and‘

regards the sixties phenomena with much more
cynicism. _

Gilmore also plays in this one, along with Fred
Donatelli. These two do the musical spoof especially
well.

' The shortest play is “Verna and Artie.”
It is about a man who returns to his wife after almost
nine months’ absence to find she is pregnant with his
child. F i

The skit consists of a dialogue between Verna and
Artie, played by Carinne Carpentier-ri and John
Waterson. The dialogue serves mainly as a vehicle
for clever insults and snappy comebacks, none of
which are very funny. This piece is less enjoyable
than the other two.

Overall. despite theshortcomings, the production
is entertaining and stimulating. ‘This enterprising

  ‘Same Time, Next Year’ Doesn’t Fail as Film 

By BOB LABRIOLA I
Pitt News Staff Writer
Same Time, Next Year
Directed by Robert ‘Mulligan

On the surface, “Same Time,
Next Year” has three things
working against its success before
the film even begins winding

T through the projector. »

Unlike the majority of recent
star-studded release, “Same Time,
Next Year” has only two char-
acters, the extent of the scenery is
simply a room in a seaside hotel in-
northern California and the film is a

takeoff of the successful Broadway .

playpof the same name. In this
case, however, three strikes do not
make an out. I

In order for a film with a limited
cast to sustain the interest of the
audience for more than 90 minutes,
the acting must be superb.

Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn, as
the couple that meets for 26
consecutiveyears for a weekend of
extramarital bliss, are just that.

While Broadway purists might
be loathe to admit that the movie
industry could ‘do anything to
improve a stage masterpiece, that
is exactly what director Robert
Mulligan has done to this play
written by Bernard Slade.

-The stage version, with Ted
Bessell and Sandy Dennis in "the
lead roles, kept the audience in
tears with a steady stream of gags.
Alda and Burstyn are no less witty,
but the tears are saved for the
romantic and touching scenes of
which there are several.

The original one-night stand
between Alda, a happily married
accountant on business, and
Burstyn, a happily married high
school dropout on N the way to

retreat, is complicated by love for
each other and for their spouses.
And so an agreement is reached——
one weekend each year the couple
meets to relive what they’ first
shared in 1951.

The passage of time is handled
well through the use of b1ack-and-
white photo montages that illu-
strate the social and cultural
changes the country undegoes
while Doris and George continue
their annual ﬂing. '

The characters are not unaffect-

ed by the changing morals of the p

country: Doris becomes involved in
the political‘ activism of the late
1960’s, and later takes advantage
of women’s liberation to become
highly’ successful in business.
George has a son shipped off to
Vietnam and eventually joins the
thousands of converts to analysis.

The film is loaded with hilarious
one-liners, but Slade (who also
wrote the movie screenplay)
touches the heart of the audience
with the very real human flaws in
the characters. Each character is
helped to overcome these flaws by
the other, much the same way two
people in ‘love act in real life.
They ﬁght, they grow and once
they even have a baby. By the
film’s end, the audience has come
to know Doris and George better
than most people know their next
door neighbors.

 were necessary. Or perhaps it was

a legal snag of some sort with
copyright laws.

In all probability the show was
simply too short, which was its
biggest failing. The program
should have had two parts or more,
to cover. more fully the artists
involved and to prevent as many

omissions as possible.

Jeff Bridges was a good choice as
a narrator. He carried the show
along well, punctuating the ﬁlmed
segments to inform the viewer with
background material.

And the concerts were not
always pretty either. In -one scene

I the Rolling Stones were doing a

show while the police (or security

guards) were literally throwing‘

people from the stage.

i The show was objective in its
crowd shots also. Instead of
showing nice youngsters attending

‘ a nice concert, there were shots of

pure children were listening to
records by some of those “awful

There were bible-thumping
preachers too. But the important

thing here was that this footage
was shown with no editorial
comment from Bridges, allowing

the viewers to reach their own,

conclusions.
“Heroes” was worth watching.

Hopefully, they will apply it to
other forms of entertainment as

SENIOR YEAR.

If you’re a junior or senior
  majoring in sciences like,
math, physics or engineering,
the Navy has a program you
should know about.

It’s called the Nuclear
Propulsion Officer Candidate-
Collegiate Program .
(NUPOC-C for short) and if
you qualify, you can earn as
much as $650 apmonth right
through your senior year.
Then after 16 weeks of
Officer Candidate School,
you’ll get an additional year
of advanced technical

‘ education. This would cost
thousands in a civilian school,
but in the Navy, we pay you.

It isn’t easy. There are
fewer than 400 openings and
only one of every six
applicants will be selected.
But if you make it, you’ll
have unequaled hands-on

0

responsibility, a $24,000
salary in four years,\and gilt-
edged qualifications for jobs
both in the Navy and out.
Ask your placement

officer to set up an interview
with a. Navy representative
when he visits the campus,
or contact your Navy
representative at 800-841-8000,

Thorogood
and Band
I Rock On

(Coritinued from page 10)
interplay between ‘the lead and
bass guitars.

“It Wasn’t Me" is a ‘rock ‘n’ roll
number penned by Chuck Berry.
Thorogood seems perfectly suited
to _play rock, ’n’ roll and this. cut
illustrates the point to a tee.

Side two opens with a tune
written by master blucsman Willie
Dixon called “That Same Thing.”
“So Much Trouble" is a brisker
up-tempo blues number that
follows.

“I’m Just You’re Good Thing” is
a classically passionate rock ’n’ roll
ballad. It recalls Fifties type
imagery, and an era that saw the
advent of rock ’n’ roll.

“Move It On Over” closes with
two Elmore James blues tunes,
“Baby Please Set a Date” and
“New Hawaiian Boogie.” Both are
very good cuts, the latter being an
instrumental. _

As rock music moves into the
1980s, it’s refreshing to see a
movement back to rock ’n’ roll’s
roots. —

It seems anymore that one who
packs a synthesizer, equalized

Vocals, and lots of media hype is

assured of success. As groups
become increasingly" electric they
tend to move further away from
what rock really is. ”

, Thorogood and the Destroyers
play honest—no frills, no gimmick,
just rock ’n’ roll. “Move It On
Over” is an album that any true
lover of rock ’n’ roll shouldn't miss.

It's Official: Central Quarterback
Dan Marino to Play for Pitt

- By JIM LEWIS
Pitt News Staff Writer
Parade all-America quarter-
back Dan Marino signed a letter of
intent to the University of.
Pittsburgh Friday at Central
Catholic High School-

“I wanted to stay home and let
my family see as many games as
possible,” Marino explained. “It’s.
not too often that a high school kid
can_ play in his hometown.”

Marino, a 6-4, 198 pounder who
led his alma mater to the WPIAI.
playoffs, narrowed his choice to
Michigan State, Clemson, Arizona
State, UCLA and Pitt before
publicly announcing his decision 12
days before the Feb, 21 deadline.

“I made my mind up early to

help Pitt in recruiting,” he
explained.

There is one stipulation in
Marino’s signing—-—he must be
allowed to play varsity baseball.

“I made that a point,” Marino
said. “Coach (Jackie) Sherrill was
agreeable to it.” '

But Marino’s main concern will
be fall football season and cracking
the starting lineup.

“It’s going to take a lot of hard
work,” Marino said. “But
competition is everything. It will
help me and Rick (Trocano) out.”

“But if I can get the opportunity
to play, I’ll give it my best shot.”

The expected change of the
Panthers’ offensive philosophy-

from last year’s option to the “I”
formation——made Pitt even more
attractive for Marino.

“I haven’t ran the option in my
life,” Marino said. “The change to
the ‘I’ deﬁnitely makes Pitt more
attractive—that’s all we ran at
Central Catholic.”

Besides playing quarterback,
Marino also punted for Catholic.

“And I deﬁnitely want to punt at
Pitt,” he claimed.

Despite all the press hype,
Marino isn’t worried about the
pressure of measuring up to the
fans’ expectations.

“There’s going to be pressure,”
Marino relented. “But if you can’t
handle the pressure, you shouldn’t
be in sports.“

. Pitt News Staff Writer

DURHAM, N.C.—Wham, bam,
thank you, Sam. . _ .

Sam Clancy’s 10-second. burst of
length-of-the-court brilliance com-
pleted a ﬁne 40 minutes of Pitt
basketball Saturday night and the
Panthers posted their seventh
consecutive win by dumping Duke,

71-69, at Cameron Indoor Stadium.

Clancy, hiding behind ‘Duke
all-American center Mike Gminski

'(6 foot, 11 inches, 245 pounds) as

Duke attempted to score a
last-seconds basket and break a

69-69 tie, blocked a pass with which.

Bob Bender was“ attempting to
spring Jim Spanarkel for a

back-door lay-in.vClan'cy corralled '

the ball and, with -13 seconds
remaining in the game, began a
75-foot spring that produced:

a a pair of shots by Clancy, the
last of which dropped through the
hoop three seconds before the
game ended; I

Duke’s heralded Gene Banks blocked two shots against Pitt. It wasn’t

enough, as the Panthers pulled an upset, 71 -89.

>Duke’s first non-Athletic Coast
Conference loss at Cameron since
December 1975; and

>Pitt’s most important win since
Tim Grgurich became basketball
coach four years ago.

“This is the greatest feeling I‘ve
ever had,” Clancy said in a locker
room whose walls could not bound
the joy of the Panthers (14-8) after
Gminski’s last-second 35-foot shot
had bounced off the rim and onto a
court where Duke rarely loses. The
only feeling you can have better
than this comes when you win the
NCAA championship.”

' Pitt. had worked toward this
game by winning six'games in 14
days;' four of those wins came
duringa week that ended Wednes-
day with a win against St. Francis.

Duke, 17-3 and ranked third in the
country before Saturday’s game,
was beaten by a group of Panthers
who were smaller but much quicker
than coach Bill Foster’s Blue
Devils.

“I still think Duke is the best
team in college basketball, ’ ’ Clancy
said after scoring 23 points and
grabbing at least 11 rebounds.
“But we..»ﬁ.gured they’d underesti-
mate us.”

‘ “We were very concerned about
Pittsburgh,” Foster said after

. Duke’s loss, which did not affect

the Blue Devils’ hold on first place
in the ACC. “We knew they were

quick—- they had outrebounded
their opponents by an amazing

margin—— and we knew they
weren’t tall. So they had to be
quick.”

Pitt’s press, at times frenzied in
the past two weeks, was not ‘so
tenacious at Durham Saturday
night but it was effective. Pittstole

,the ball from Duke 11 times-
Wayne Williams was accused six
times—and, according to Foster,
“the difference in the game was
that when Pittsburgh stole a pass,
it scored. We didn’t do that at all.”

Another difference occurred at
the foul lines. Pitt scored with half
its ﬁeld goal attempts7(25 of 50)
while Duke earned 30 ﬁeld goals

with a scoring percentage of 53, but i

the Blue Devils hit only 9 of 1.7 free
throws and the Panthers, led by
Clancy (9 of 10), made 21 of 29 foul
shots.

allowed Duke to explode despite
the volatilenature of the 8,564 fans

“We need more tough games
like this,” Pitt forward Sam Ellis
"said after the game, which was tied
11 times and whose biggest lead
came when Strickland’s 15-foot
jump shot gave Pitt a 37-32

folks trudge through ‘sludge and obliterate
their winter-time blahs with the aid of a shot
glass, as Pittsburghers are wont to do during a
year’s first few months. Not in Durham,
North Carolina. ’

The Pitt basketball _team and a few
-stragglers visited Durham this weekend for a
date at Duke, an academic institution whose
alumni have yielded an endowment sturdy as
the stone used to constructthe fine buildings
of its sprawling campus.

Duke’s reputation as an attractive school is
nearly equal to the current standing (fourth in
the nation before it met Pitt) of the Blue Devil
basketball team. But even those accustomed
to the mediocrity at Pitt could not help but
wonder at North Carolina. It is a state stun-
ned and battered into paralysis by a three-inch
snowfall; a state where it still is illegal to serve
liquor by the drink; and a state whose
inhabitants largely do not object to being
labeled Tar Heels.

What is there to do in North Carolina——and
Durham in particular—when a light snow
falls and voters offer fresh opposition to
liquor—by-the-glass, each of which occurred
during our recent journey to the heart of the
revered Atlantic Coast Conference?

reported that the percentage of students who
have gone Greek may approach 60, though no
fraternities occupy a house. .

Football, according to most sutdents, is
“something to warm things up for basket-
ball” at Duke. “Nobody sees the football

Saints Alive! Icers Murder Penn State-McKeesport, 1 0-0

By JIM NELSON

The Pitt hockey team added a
win to its season record of 5-8 with
a 10-0 thrashing of Penn State-
McKeesport on Saturday.

The Panthers,‘who outshot the
Saints 59-11 in the game, took the
early lead when center Tom
Sherwin scored his first goal in the
game at 1:39. Sherwin, who led
Pitt with two goals and four assists,
was set up by a pass from Scott
Kimmick, who also scored two
goals. 4

Pitt increased its lead to 2-0 in
the first period when Paul Kilian
tipped a Bill Gedeon pass into an
empty net after Gedeon drew
Saints goalie Kirk Junker out of the
net.

Pitt News Staff Writer ‘

Saturday was not an easy day
for Pitt's swimmers (9-0), even
though they clobbered Cleveland
State, 83-29, at the Cleveland State
Natatorium.

Problems plagued the Panthers
even before the meet began when

-» the team bus, which had no heat,

was forced to make an emergency
stop because starter Mickey
Termin was sick and needed some
cough medicine.

A delay resulted and the
Panthers, arriving late, did not
have sufficient time to warm up.

Although it amassed one of its
highest points totals of the_season,
inconveniences bothered Pitt
throughout the meet. Only once
this season did the Panthers score
more (90 points against Penn State
several weeks ago), but that did not
impress Pitt swimmer Dale Pflau-
mer.

“The score really was deceiv-
ing,” Pflaumer said. “We were
lucky that Cleveland State was bad
or we may have been in trouble.
Our depth overwhelmed them and

Curt Hetz, robbed three times of
a goal in the first period, ﬁnally got
one past Junker just nine seconds
into the second period off passes
from defensemen Eric Barcaskey
and Russ'Stump for a 3-0 lead.

Gedeon and Kimmick added
goals before- the period ended.
Gedeon beat Junker at 3:04 with
assists fromW'C?Zii“y Fries and
Kimmick ﬁred a shot in at 7:35 with
assists from Vern Shaver and
Sherwin for fn-iinsurmountable 5-0
lead. I  A
Pitt goaltender‘ Larry Newell,
who along with Hetz was offered a
tryout for the 1980 Olympic hockey
team, was replaced by Ken Greb
with about eight minutes gone in

Pitt ﬁnished first in every event
except the 50-yard freestyle.

“No one swam‘that well,” said
Pflaumer, who placed second in
both the 500- and 1,650-yard
freestyles. “We had» a couple of
good swims, but not that many.

“lfthink we’re looking forward to
Cincinnati," Pﬂaumer continued.
“We really want to go undefeated,
and to do that we're going to have
to defeat Cincinnati."

Against West Virginia last week,
Pitt coach Fred Lewis said that “90
percent of the team was on,"
indicating that many of his
swimmers did well. Saturday,
“only 50 percent was on,"
Pflaumer added.

“We did okay, but we can do
better," the swimmer said.

Pitt, undefeated in its last 20
dual meets, closes its season this
Saturday at Cincinnati.

Newell lowered his

Pitt started exactly where it left
off in the third period, scoring ﬁve
times against defenseless Penn
State-McKeesport. Dan Di-
Tomasso began a scoring barrage
at 0:46 on a perfect feed from Hetz
to make the score 6-0.

Pitt Quadrangular

ByJIlVILEWIS
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pitt wrestling team dropped
all three of its matches to Cleveland
State, Navy and William & Mary in
the Pitt Quadrangular at the Field
House Saturday. ‘

The Panthers (5-8) lost an
important Eastern Wrestling
League contest to ninth-ranked
CSU in the ﬁnale, 26-9, after falling
to Navy, 21-16, and W & M, 20-18,
to insure a losing dual meet season.

“I really felt that today was
going to be our day,” assistant
coach Rande Stottlemyer said.
“The feeling was, ‘Man! this is it.
Today’s our day.’ We had great
practices all week. That’s the last
time I go on feelings.

“It’s back to the drawing board
now.”

Pitt got steady performances
from 118-pounder Glenn Maxwell
and 126-pounder Jose Martinez
who both won all their individual
bouts. Maxwell knocked off Guy
Zanti of Navy, 4-1, Indian Jim
Pagano, 6-5, and previously un-
defeated Jamie Reid of Cleveland
State, 9-3.

Martinez decisioned Midship-
man Doug Heimbach, 4-3, W&M’s
Bruce Davidson, 6-1, and super-
decisioned Viking Terry Weigel,
10-2. .

Otherwise, the results were grim
for Pitt.

“We were not getting 100
percent from everyone,” head
coach Dave Adams charged. “We
were making mistakes we
shouldn’t have been making at this

point—technical mistakes that
should be straightened out by
now.”

The only other bright moments
of the day were 177-pounder Jim

Gordon’s two wins—an 8-3 de- '

cision over William & Mary's Tom
Dick and a 9-7 decision over Navy's
Steve Weaver——and 167-pound
freshmap Eric Harris’ close 5-4 loss
to Cleveland State’s strong Jack
Vanadia.

“Our two lightweights did a nice
job,” Stottlemyer said. “Harris did
a nice job when he stepped in and
Gordon did not look too bad.

“But otherwise ‘thumbs
down’—that’s the ﬁrst time in a
while I had to hang my head a
little.’’

Pitt dropped to 1-3 in the EWL,
behind sixth-place Lock Haven
(1-2) but ahead of last place Penn
State (0-4). The Panthers have only
two more dual meets remaining
before the EWL Tournament at the
Field House Feb. 24 and 25. They
meet Penn State Saturday \and
West Virginia next week.

Can Pitt improve in time for
those matches? 9

“_Wef1l ﬁnd out,” Stottlemyer
said. “I want to see what these
guys are made of after today.”

The Panthers hope to peak at the
EWL Tournament, and do not
expect the Pitt Quadrangular
results to affect them.

“Tournaments are different, ’ ’
Stottlemyer said, “A lot different.
And Iihope we can get ready in
time for the EWL Tournament.”

Despite 83-29 Victory

butterﬂy; Stu Swanson, 200-yard
backstroke, and Bob Clemmer,
200-yard breaststroke.

Pitt also won in the relays...The
400-yard medley relay was contest-
ed in four separate events—100—
yard backstroke, 100-yard breast-

and

 

100-yard freestyle—all of which
Pitt won.

Neither Swanson ‘ nor Schuman
qualiﬁed for the National Colleg-
iate Athletic Association Champ-
ionship, to be held early next
month at Cleveland State, although

Panther backstroker Stu Swanson won the 200-yard backstroke at Cleveland State in his team's 83-29 victory.
He didn‘t qualify for the NCAA’s, however, as expected.

Pitt News Staff Writer
Both Pitt’s men’s and women’s
gymnastics teams set scoring
records‘ Saturday at Slippery Rock.

The men defeated the Rockets
194.55-187.90, an all time high for
men’s gymnastics at Pitt.

The Pantherettes scored a
season high 132.55 points to
Slippery Rock’s 122.85.

“We need to consistently score

" 132 or more if we want to be in

good shape to qualify for the
” said coach Donna
DeMarino Sanft. “The pressure
will ‘really be on in the next few
weeks.”

The women were paced by Myra

. Bachuchin, who finished first in the

all-around, scoring 33.35. Bach-
uchin also placed in each individual

event. She was second in the vault ~

and unevens, scoring 8.6 and 8.45,
respectively. Bachuchin took third
‘place in both the balance beam
(8.1) and ﬂoor exercise (8.2).
“Myra really

is pulling

‘ through,” said Sanft. “This is the

first meet since her injury that- ’

she's gone all-around.”

Holly Martino won three of the
events, but placed third in the
all-around. Martino took top
honors in the vault (8._75), unevens
(8.75) and floor exercise (8.65).-

“Holly did a fantastic job, except
for the balance beam,” said Sanft.

“although we were pleased that‘

she hit her new move on the
beam—‘-a_ ‘gainer back ﬂip.’ ’

Alsoplacing in three events was
Bonnie Tressler, who won the
balance beam (8.55), and placed
second in the floor exercise (8.5)

and third iii the unevens (8.45),
Tressler’ placed second in the »

‘all-around with a total score of
33.30.

According to Sanft, Karen Zandi
had her highest scores of the
season in the vault (7.5), the beam

(7.6) and the ﬂoor exercise (7.75). ’

Roxanne Evans competed on the
beam for the first time ‘since her
ankle injury and should return to
competition in the ﬂoor exercise
next week. Jill Morris reinjured
her knee on her dismount from the
uneven bars.  .

“Roxanne is one of the team’s
better vaulters,” said Sanft, “and
we’re really missing her there.”

Sanft said the team looked at the   I

Slippery Rock contest as a tri-meet,
and will continue to take that
attitude next week.

“It will be Pitt vs; William and
Mary and Pitt vs. Pitt,” she said.
“It really gets us. psyched to go out
there and try to beat last week’s
scores. We’ll be looking for a score
of 133 next week.” V

The men’s team, despite being
crippled. by injuries, set a new Pitt
record for scoring. Many indiv-
iduals scored their highest marks in
the individual events.

“Everybody did a good job,”
said coach Frank D’Amico. “I was
very impressed with the team.
Before the meet, I predicted a score
of 194 as well as individual scores,
and told the guys that this is what
you have to do and they went out
and did it.”

The men were led by Bob
Besong, who won the all-around
with his highest score to date of
49.65, narrowly missing the “elite
score” in men’s gymnastics of 50
points. Besong, in the individual
events, won the floor exercise
(8.75) and the rings 68.85‘). He took
second place in the high bar. ’

Doug Smith took first in the high

bar and second place" in the
all-around with a 44.05, his highest
all-around score ever.

In the parallel bars, Pitt took the

‘lead for good after a one-two-three

finish. Allan Meyers took first with
a 9.0 while Cem Akisoglu took
second with an 8.05 and Besong

 :1

ﬁnished third with a 7.85.
Meyers also took second in the
ﬂoor exercise (8.5) and rings (8.55).

(7.6)' and tied for third with
teammate Joe Semiani in the vault
(8.6). _
D’Amico lauded the efforts of

Both the men’s and women’s
track teams were the victims of last
weekend’s sub-zero degree
weather. In both meets, Panthers
versus Ohio Stateand Wisconsin,
and the Pantherettes against
Slippery Rock State College,

Lady Runners Chill Rockets; Men Freeze ate io State  

‘conditions were colder on the

indoor tracks than for any of the
squads’ cross-country meets last
fall.

The visiting women overcame’

the chill in the air and SRSC’s
Rockets by sweeping the 50-yard

. dash and dominating several other

events to win, 57-34. The men fell
to both Ohio State and Wisconsin,
62-58-33. —

Leslie Palmer paced the 1-1
Pantherettes by winning both the
50-yard dash and her specialty, the

jhurdles. Dee Dee Kantner finished

second, followed by Lisa Sciullo.
Kantner and Sciullo later were ﬁrst
and second in the 220-yard dash.

Carmen Scherich won the shot
put with her best throw of the
season and Pitt’s Donna Pangburn
was second. School record-.holder
Peri Jude Radecic outdistanced all
competitors in the event but had
been entered in exhibition.

Other second places were won by
Margie Lee, two-mile run; Sue
Lewis, 440-yard dash; Jane

Strause, 880-yard_run and Karen
Krichko, high jump.

Brenda Chorpenning ‘was the
winner in the one-mile run and
placed third in the two_-mile run.
Louise Carlson, 440-yard run; Barb
Billek, one-mile run; Lewis, 50-
yard hurdles and Karen Bradley,
880-yard run were all third.

The 880-yard relay of Cissy
Wilborn, Bradley, Palmer
Linda Mitchell had "no problem
winning when the Rockets missed a
handoff and dropped the baton.
Nevertheless, Pitt had been fa-
vored in the event and most likely

would have won handily. However,

the mile relay team of Wilborn,
Krichko, Maria . Sciullo and
Mitchell was not as fortunate and
was edged out by Slippery Rock,
losing by less than one hundredth
of a second.

Pitt competed without top

sprinters Gwen Murray and Lisa
Haupt, who are both injured. High
jumpers Marie Ribik and Pam
Gearing were competing in a meet
in Delaware.

The men's team relied upon its
ﬁeld men to score about half of its
33 points. Leading the way were
triple jumper Larry Kinney and
long jumper Tim Blackshear, who
were the only Panther winners in
the meet. Blackshear was also a

Williams corrected his statement
when his attention was directed
toward Clancy, who was swamped
by writers after the game. “Sam is
one heck of a big guy...He.just isn’t
as tall as some of the people we
play.”

tallest starter, were held even-

Finishing third were Gene Roach,

Mike Taylor and Dwante DeFore.

Eric Crist, pole vault; Don

“I would say that the freezing
temperature inside the Ohio State
ﬁeld house deﬁnitely affected our
athletes’ individual perfor-
mances,” said coach Mike Agostin-
ella. “Some of our lighter athletes,
such as Dwayne DeFore, Kinney
and Mike Sapiena, were having a
tough time keeping warm.”

The weather was no equalizing
factor, however. it

“We realized that we do not
have the scholarship base of the
other schools, and that we would
have a depth problem,” said
Agostinella. .“Of course we’re not
happy about losing, but I think our
individual’ performances over-
shadowed our loss.” '
