What is the longest time that you have ever

. Ream did.

He fasted to stand up for something he believes
in.
On July 27, 1995 President Clinton signed the

ronmental laws governing salvage logging on
public lands. This made it possible for lumber
companies tocut down trees in National Forests
that may be up to 1,000 years old. This is why
Ream went.on his hunger strike. ‘

In October of 1995, Ream planted himself on
the steps of the ‘Eugene Federal Building in
Oregon and began fasting. He chose this spot
because a judge inside the building had ruled in

Clearcut Salvage Rider, which suspends all envi- V

the industry’s favor on several Rider-related
cases.

On Monday night, Ream spoke to a crowd at
the Oakland Beehive about his ﬁght to save the
trees and why he feels we should all be a part of
1t.

He said, “All of the places that we are talking
about are public lands. We are all owners of this
land, and we need to voice our opinions.”

Ream spoke of how the rider calls for the
clearcutting of dead, dying or diseased trees or of
trees that are in danger of wild ﬁres. But he also
said that these are not the trees that are being cut
down.

“Most of the trees that I have seen cut down
had no diseases, were not dying and definitely
were not dea .”

He is also in favor of leaving forests that have
burned or ones in danger of burning. “A burned

and will take place this Friday

Critical Mass is basically a
big bike ride. Participants will
ride en mass through the city
during rush hour to make city
council and the public aware
of the necessity of bike lanes
in Pittsburgh.

’ “Stopping traffic and pissing
off drivers seems to be the
only way to get our point
across,” said Elly Glenn, one
of the organizers of the event.
“ltis completely dangerous to
ride your bike here in
Pittsburgh. The unusually
skinny roads make for great
accidents. I know several peo-
ple who have been hit by
cars.”

The reasons that they ride in
a group are pretty simple. First
of all, they do it for the safety
factor of travelling in large
numbers. Glenn said, “If we

Scholarship winners to travel the world

By Beth Fisher
Staff Writer

For 32 Pitt students, this summer is

going to be more than returning home .

for a break from classes. Winners of
Pitt’s Nationality Rooms Summer Study
Abroad Scholarships, these students
will be immersing themselves not in the
neighborhood swimming pool, but in
the cultures of 20 different countries.

This past Saturday, the scholarship-

winners attended an orientation program
and listened to last year’s winners share
their own abroad experiences. Fifteen
graduate students and 13 undergradu-
ates were then presented with checks
that together totaled $59,000. The
money is raised by the same ethnic
groups responsible for-financing the
Cathedral, of Learning’s Nationality
Rooms.

“Their purpose is to raise money to
send people to their country for immer-
sion purposes,” said E. Maxine Bruhns,
director of Pitt’s Nationality Rooms and

Intercultural Exchange Programs.

“They are very proud of their her-
itage, and they want Pitt students to
share this pride,’.’ added Bruhns.

Bill Sharek, one of the graduate win-
ners, will be traveling to Poland this
summer and seemed to have these wish-
es in mind.

“I have hoped for such an opportunity
for over 20 years,” said Sharek, who

 

will study Polish privatization as well as
work at the Institute of Environmental
Protection. ’

“I wanted to find a niche where I
could contribute something to Poland,
and now I feel I have that chance,” he
continued.

This is not the first time Sharek, 43,

~ will be spending time in another coun-

try. The son of a U.S. State Department
diplomat, he has spent about eight years

abroad. He was born in Washington,
D.C., and has lived in nine states and
six different countries.

Sharek earned his undergraduate
degree in Russian studies from Knox
College, after spending time at Case

Western Reserve University as well as '

Georgetown University.

He began his master’s work at Pitt’s
GSPIA this past fall, after starting and
stopping graduate work three times over
the past 15 years. This is understand-
able, however, if you consider the other
things he has had going on in his life.

For two years, he was the regional
marketing director for Ringling Bros.
Barnum and Bai1ey,Circus, where he
handled everything from publicity to
financial auditing. In addition, Sharek
was a marketing and fundraising direc-

tor for four professional entertainment .

companies, and later for the Three
Rivers Shakespeare Festival. ‘
He is planning to return to Poland
after he graduates next spring, where he

Squeeze a stress boll

Dr. Rdhert P. Gallagher

Stress is a normal part of our
everyday life, and, in fact,
some stress, such as the kind
that motivates us to study for

an exam, can be helpful. When '

the quantity or the intensity of
the stressors we encounter
become too great, however, we
may find ourselves faced with
emotional and physical health
problems that can interfere
with college life.

College students are prime
targets for stress overload. The
combined pres-
sures of acade-
mic work, high
parental expec-
tations, intense
and sometimes
fragile relation-
ships,‘ career
uncertainty, the
highs and lows
of the party
scene, and a
variety of value conﬂicts, can
become overwhelming at
times.

Students seem to know when
they are feeling “stressed out”
and generally also seem to
know how they can avoid or
reduce the stress in their lives.
Most know, for instance, that
they can better cope with stress
when they follow a good diet
(especially reasonable caffeine
intake), exercise regularly and
get adequate rest. Many stu-

‘ childhood beliefs that external
5 forces (luck, fate, the good or

 

dents also know that they can
reduce their stress if they orga-
nize their lives better, become
more tolerant of themselves
and others and’ practice relax-
ation techniques (yoga, medita-
tion, deep breathing) for short
periods of time each day.

The problem is that although
people usually know how they
can reduce stress, they often do
not believe that the power to
do so is within their control.
Frequently, they cling to old

bad will of oth-
ers) or
unchangeable
p e r s o n a l i t y
traits (bad
genes) are what
really deter-
mines out-
comes in their
lives.

This is not an
easy belief pat-
tern to overcome, but it can be
done. Look within yourself and
see if you subvert-your own
best intentions. If so, commit
yourself to a process of change
and take back control of your
life. To get started, take one of
your less pressing problems
and determine to solve it,
either on your own or with the
help of a friend or a profes-
sional counselor. Use your suc-
cess to gain the confidence you

—Tim Ream “The biggest prob-

that activists like yourselves have done

less cutting.”

Between his environmental speech-
es, Ream presented a beautiful multi-
media show. It started off with a video
presentation of what the National
Forests were, what they now are and
what they will be if the Rider is not
repealed. ‘

He then put on an informative slide
show that packaged together powerful
music and pictures. Whether it was a
man standing next to a fallen tree that
was wider than it was tall or a picture
of a species that has become-extinct
because of the salvage, it brought tears

— it seems almost a lost cause today.”

The message that Ream had wasthat
it _is not too late. “Our tax dollars are
paying for this clearcutting. Nobody
builds more roads than the National
Forest Service. We can change this by
voicing our opinion to our elected ofﬁ-
cials.”

Ream ended his message by saying,
“Only 15 percent of the lumber used in
the U.S. comes from our National
Forests. Do we really need to keep
destroying them for this small
amount?” ‘ .

a lot_of drivers aware and a part of our
action.” Publicity is the main reason for
Critical Mass, as it is for most action cam-
paigns.

Glenn said that one of the reasons that
bike riding is so dangerous is that drivers
are not aware of how to share the road.
With the establishment of bike lanes, the
drivers don’t really need to know about
this. Or they will receive better instructions

or SEAC. There have been several Critical
Mass events in many other cities around
the country.

This is not only an event to obtain bike
lanes in the city, it is also an event to pro-
mote bike riding as an alternative form of
transportation. It is based on the idea that
as the number of bicyclists in‘ a city
increases, it will eventually reach a “critical
mass,” at which time the city will be forced
to accommodate them.

the use of bicycles as an alternative to
cars.” This is especially true in a city like
Pittsburgh, where nothing is very far away.

Another reason Glenn stated was that
riding bicycles reduces the amount of park-
ing, roads and traffic, which generally
makes a city a better place to live.

“Recently, Pittsburgh was voted one of
the most liveable cities in the U.S. A large
part of this was because of the number of
trees within the city limits. These trees are
dying because of the pollution, a lot of
which is caused by cars.”

need to attack another one of
your stressors. Success
inevitably breeds further suc-
cess. If you pair this strategy
for problem resolution with a
plan for healthier living, and
if you build some quiet or
playful time into your daily
life, ’you will be well pre-
pared to handle much of the
stress of college life. There
will probably never be a bet-

right now. ,

Another way to get a

A con strtutronal joke

The Constitution was once again bastardized to protect criminals
on Monday. According to a three-judge Superior Court ruling in
Pennsylvania, a Liquor Control Board officer does not have the
authority to stop a motorist suspected of driving under the inﬂu-
ence. And because that authority is absent, at least one drunk dri-
ver will probably never see a courtroom.

One Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board ofﬁcer stopped a driver
who (according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, March 26) was
swerving from one side to the other of a state highway with the
front end of his car smashed and who stopped at a green light. The
PLCB officer called the state police, who then arrested the driver
for drunk driving. The Superior court’s ruling, though,‘threw out
the evidence of the driver’s intoxication. The decision was based
on the twisted interpretation that the evidence was gathered in vio-
lation of the Fourth Amendment which protects against unlawful
search and seizure.

There are several serious problems which could arise from this
decision. First, this‘ could present serious complications with sobri-
ety checkpoints. It won’t take long for some moron who was
arrested at a checkpoint to decide that there was no just cause for
his (or her) being stopped, and the Fourth Amendment will once
again be twisted to help someone obviously guilty get off. ’

Of course, the Fourth Amendment is not something to be taken
lightly. Even the worst criminals deserve their constitutional rights
to a fair trial. However, the amendment was not designed to let
criminals get off on technicalities. The fact that a PLCB officer
does not have the authority to stop a driver does not make that dri-
ver any less drunk, and it does not make a drunk driver any less
dangerous to other innocent people on the road.

This leads to the second point. Exactly why doesn’t the PLCB or
its officers have the authority to stop suspected drunk drivers?

‘Their job, as the Liquor Control Board, should not revolve around
simply busting underage drinkers at Zelda’s. They should be able’

to take the necessary action when someone is driving under the
inﬂuence. When it comes to drunk driving, the potential risk to
everyone in the area is so great that a crossing guard should have
the authority to stop someone. -

This case ruled that the arrest of a drunk driver was a violation
of search and seizure laws; many also argue that checkpoints are a
violation of the right to privacy. But if you are not drunk, you
should be happy to come across one of the checkpoints. You can
know that no one will be drunk behind you on that trip. If you are

drunk, your only argument is that you got caught. The benefit to 

society in general greatly outweighs any clever interpretation of
the Fourth Amendment.

There comes a point when Fourth Amendment protection, like
First Amendment protection, no longer applies. Just as you do not
have the right to yell “Fire!” in a crowded theater, you do not have
the right to put everyone at risk by driving drunk. Would the
Superior Court have ruled the same way if the driver had killed
someone before the PLCB officer stopped him?

Backyard boy for ce President

It’s official: Bob Dole will be
the Republican who will try to
dethrone Bill Clinton from the
White House. The next step for
the Senate majority leader
from Kansas is to pick a run-
ning mate. '

Wanting to be vice president
is something I’ve always had
difficulty understanding. Of
course, there’s the underlying

possibility that you could -

become president, but beyond
that its pretty much a figure-
head post.‘

Regardless, the GOP vice
presidential pick is crucial this

year, because the party needs.

to pick up any votes it can get
to remove Whitewater Willie.

And despite the ﬂaws of the
position, there are a ton of
wannabes, people who want to
be on the ticket so they can get
their foot in the door for a
post-Dole run for the presiden-
cy.

Retired Army General Colin
Powell and New Jersey
Governor Christine Todd
Whitman are two frequently
discussed possibilities, but for
every positive they bring to the
table, they have two negatives.

. Some other names that have
been thrown around, such as
former Secretary of Education
William Bennett, former
Secretary of Defense Dick
Cheney, and Ohio
Congressman John Kasich,
have more merit, but none is
clearly better then the other.

But there is one person who
can stand in front of the crowd
and distinguish himself as an
excellent vice—presidential can-
didate. And he lives and works
right here in our own backyard.

' He's Governor Tom Ridge.

The Erie native is the perfect
candidate to run with Dole for
five reasons:

Age:

Ridge turned 50 last year.

Dole is 73, a generation older. ’

Voters are going to have to feel
comfortable that there is a
young, adequate replacement if
Dole’s age catches up to him

 

Mark
Gordon

and he starts running the coun- A

try like a Democrat, or‘ some
other kind of terrible ailment
like that.

Ridge’.s age also lends well
to combating Clinton’s popu-
larity amongst the 40 and 50-
something voters. He could
help the GOP steal some of
those votes.

Non-Political Experience:

Ridge is the perfect opposi-
tion to Clinton, who is pretty.
shaky in this department.
Ridge graduated with honors
from Harvard in 1967 and was
in the top percentage of his law
class at Dickinson in 1972. In
between those academic years,
Ridge served in the Vietnam
War, honoring his country as a
decorated Army Sergeant.

At the same time that Ridge
was serving in the armed

-forces, Clinton “wasn’t inhal-

ing” and was serving his coun-
try by avoiding the draft and
then lying about it.

Political Experience:

Ridge has had a steady rise
in his political career, much
like Dole did in the 1950s and
‘60s in Kansas.-He started as
an assistant district attorney
and worked his way up to a
U.S. congressman.

Ridge is also proving himself
to be an excellent governor of
a relatively large and diversi-
fied state. Under his leader-
ship, the state representatives
recently killed affirmative
action in state hiring practices
and passed a law to try more
juveniles as adults. Plus, the
governor is stimulating real
welfare reform.

And Ridge has demonstrated
the ability to make decisions
that might not go over well
with the voters, if they are
decisions that he believes in.
The recent Pennsylvania gas
tax-increase is a perfect exam-
ple.

Governor Ridge also fits
well with Dole because both
conservatives do something
that the Clinton/Gore tandem
has rarely done: keep .a
promiseu * 

Outsider Angle: T

Ridge is the perfect comple-
ment to Dole,’a lifelong D.C.
“insider.” Sure, Ridge had a
decade in D.C., but the majori-
ty of his career has been out-
side the capitol. The GOP
could use that to its advantage
alongside Dole.

In 1980 and 1984 the
Republicans won easily with
an outsider/insider combina-
tion (Reagan/Bush). This fits
the bill. _

The Pennsylvania Factor:

Ridge can give Dole a big
help in securing Pennsylvania,
which is usually considered a
“swing” state. Sure, there are
other swing, mid-westem state
GOP governors like
Michigan’s John Engler,
Ohio’s John Voinovich and
Wisconsin’s Tommy
Thompson. But Ridge carries
more clout than those three,
and Pennsylvania carries more
electoral votes.

Ridge has proven himself to
be an excellent governor, and
he would be a great asset to the

Dole campaign in 1996. He’s '

not the ultimate of oxymorons,
a “fiscal-conservative/social
liberal,” like New Jersey’s
Whitman, and he’s not a
“Rockefeller Republican.” But
his views are moderate enough
to attract a lot voters who are
uncertain on Election Tuesday.

Dole/Ridge in ‘96. Beats the
hell out of four more from
Clinton and Gore.

A lesson in education for t

At Yale University, a new
breed of leadership has
streamlined the university
with profiteering reform. An
institution once draped in ivy
has been exposed to the cor-
rupting agents of entrepre-
neurship, leaving students to
suffer under a cold, imper-
sonal ivory establishment.

The international commu-
nity has denounced the Yale
administration’s economic
restructuring. The corporati-
zation of the university, led
by profiteering corporate
executives, has resulted in a
downsizing in pay scales and
a devaluation in faculty ser-
vices and clerical and custo-
dial staff. Thisis work essen-
tial to operating the universi-
ty and sustaining a city with
the fourth highest poverty
rate in the nation. Incredibly,
Yale is delivering these

. blows to the local economy

after having earned ,a "record
15.7 percent profit on its $4
billion endowment (compara-
tively, Pittreceives $140 mil-
lion in endowments each
year‘)i How much of this
money did Yale allocate to
funding academics? Four
percent. Yale has become a
corporation reestablished by
the reforms of draconian

Voicing the

On ‘March 19 The Pitt, News
published a letterfrom Jennifer
Clouse and Aaron Masri. The
letter questions certain policies
about the acceptance of volun-
teers by the student-run Hand-
In-Hand Festival. Since 1979,
the students, faculty and staff
of the University of Pittsburgh,

-‘ in cooperation with the com-

munity of greater'Pittsburgh,
have given tirelessly each year
to those less fortunate through
the Hand‘-In-Hand Festival. As

’ for the policy that volunteers

must be Pitt students, that is not
the policy of the Hand-In-Hand
staff, rather it is a policy of the
University of Pittsburgh and is
in place only because of insur-
ance concerns. I agree with
Jennifer when she said that the
involvement of non-student
volunteers would amplify the
experiences gained at the festi-
val. I do not agree with the let-
ter when she said that the lack
of outside involvement “defeats
the purpose of community ser-
vice.” Nor do I agree that the
Hand-In-Hand festival is
“sending the wrong message
about what volunteerism
should be.” Rather, I would say
that she would be pressed to
find a better example of stu-
dents reaching out to help the
communityof Pittsburgh. It
was explained to Ms. Clouse
about the policy and why that
policy existed. Her letter is an
example of how slanderous
attacks can hurt people on a

‘ personal level, especially when

those people are volunteers
themselves. Outside involve-

entrepreneurs who are more
concerned about financing
investments than financing
education. '

One thousand fifty mem-
bers of Yale’s Graduate
Employees and Students
Organization have worked
towards winning respect,
higher wages and improved
benefit packages from their
elitist Establishment.
Exploited as laborers, they
have marched and picketed,
backed by an international
following shocked and dis-
mayed by Yale’-s reprehensi-
ble tactics. The leadership at
Yale has responded with a
deafening silence, exhibiting
of a flagrant disregard for
moral ethics and social jus-
tice. Corporate greed has
transcended academic raison
d’etre at Yale, unveiling the
administration’s total lack of
concern for the advancement
of both the student and the
New Haven communities.

As a result of the silence to
its nonresistant demonstra-
tions, GESO has had to
undertake a more assertive,
consequential campaign. Last
fall, TAs in GESO threatened
to withhold undergraduate
grades until a collective bar-
gaining agreement

ir opinions.

‘r'nent'is encouraged; we accept
donations of food, skills and
money from local businesses
and individuals. It is regret-
table, however, that non-mem-
bers of the Pitt community can-
not take an active role as a vol-
unteer on the day of the festi-
val.

Jason Curtis,—in his March 25
column “Immigration equals
excess,” simply got it wrong.
Immigrants aren’t “parasites”
who deserve to be “executed.”
Instead of attacking the prob-
lem, Curtis attacked the immi-
grants.

Curtis misses the point
regarding illegal immigration.
Illegal immigration is wrong.
We don’t ‘need an economic
reason to justify stopping it.
But instead of stopping illegal
immigrants at the border,
Curtis advocates executions
and confiscations. Such dra-
conian methods are wrong-
headed, immoral and doomed
to fail. Furthermore, Curtis
needs to get his facts straight.
He ignores the temporary agri-
cultural workers already admit-
ted annually and the new
stronger penalties against
employees.

A majority of legal immi-
grants — or “parasites” in
Curtisian — are relatives of
U.S. citizens, and most of the
rest are relatives of permanent
residents (or are sponsored by
employers. If Mr. Curtis mar-

reached. This was successful
in generating intemperate
responses from seemingly
indifferent, hostile managers
—— a sickening grumble of
discontent which de-personi-
fied the leadership at Yale.

It is plausible to believe
that this vocal resentment
will allow all future adminis-
trative indifference to be
regarded as a sort of defen-
sive pretension. It is up to the
unions and the international
community to continue elicit-
ing emotion from the direc-
torship at Yale. It is becom-
ing evident that the further
this breed of leaders strays
from indifference, the less
effectively they can defend
themselves against assertive
opposition. Case in point: the
administration at Yale recent-
ly yielded to a 30 percent
increase in TA wages.

As an undergraduate repre-
sentative of the general stu-
dent body at Pitt, I should
note the adverse conse-
quences a strike would have
on many of us if Pitt’s admin-
istration were similar to
Yale’s. If grad students at Pitt
went on strike, the classes

ried an Australian woman,
would he want the law to man-
date that he live in Australia in
order to live with his wife? Is
she a “parasite”? Curtis’s ceil-
ing would eliminate most
immigration, "including 2/3 of
immediate relatives —— spouses
and minor children of U.S. citi-
zens. That’s unfair to our fel-
low Americans.

Instead of attacking immi-
grants and rewriting the
Constitution, we can come to a
solution which respects both
immigrants and the principles
upon which our nation was
founded. We can decrease
immigration — we just ought
to act like Americans while
doing it.

Andrew J. Kennedy

This opinion is for all those
morons out there, Democrat or
Republican, who want to
ELIMINATE welfare.‘I agree
that there are major flaws in the
system as it exists today and it
should be reformed, but it is
needed. I have an older brother
whose wife worked in the same
shop he did. They had a child
they just adopted, and then
both were laid off. He CHOSE
to go back to college. But in
the mean time, they had no
income. Without welfare and
food stamps, they would have
been in serious trouble. He got
off of it as soon as possible
because he was ashamed to
have to live that way. So don’t
tell me that welfare should be
eliminated. Sure, there are peo-
ple with 31 kids sponging off

he corporate establishment

they taught might not be
held. If professors didn’t
have the time to grade our
tests and papers, they could
have other profs or grad stu-
dents grade our work, regard-
less of whether or not they
were competent in the field.
Things like section atten-
dance, participation and ear-
lier grades would have to be
guessed-or left out of the
final grade.

Once the strike ended, the
grades the TAs submitted
would be subject to change
— but then why have grades?
Supplying flawed grades just
for the sake of having a grade
on a transcript makes a
mockery of the whole system
of grading! Undergrads
should ask themselves,
“Would we dissent or unite
with GSPAN, the Pitt version
of GESO?”

It is in the best interests of
the grad and the undergrad
students to work together in a
show of cooperative solidari-
ty. When administrators
choose to spend conserva-
tively, that’s when we as
undergrads should take
advantage of the situation,
for that’s when grad students
need as much support as they
can get! We give GSPAN our

of society. So reform it. We
have assholes in Congress, so

i should we eliminate that too?

' There _is a real need for pro-
grams like welfare. I’m sick
and tired of people who think
people on welfare are bums or
are lazy. How do you support a
family while you are studying
for your degree? You can’t

. without killing yourself. I’m

sure some Republican out there
will say they supported nine
people, went to college, volun-
teered at the local church,
baked cookies and walked 10
miles uphill everyday to do all
this. But for some people,  is
just not possible. So before you
Buchanan backers jump off-
sides, take aminute and think
about it. I used to think welfare
was for lazy people until some-
one in my family desperately
needed it to survive.

I am writing in response to
the March 13 column on Pat
Buchanan. I was rather amazed
that somebody could write such
an outspoken article without
having a full understanding of
the facts.

It was not that I disagreed
with the whole column. As a
matter of fact, I found the bit
on the sensationalism in the
mass media to be right on tar-
get. More specifically, I took
issue with his comments on the
topics of NAFTA and the pro-
posed “wall” on the border of
the United States and Mexico.

When I read a column in The

support, they give us provi-
sions!

For example, in return for
our active support (organiz-
ing an undergrad student
union to campaign and
demonstrate), GSPAN might
demand that the administra-
tion lower class size and
maintain undergrad financial
aid. TAs would get their rais-
es and benefits; students
would have an environment
more conducive learning.
Perhaps the administration
could reallocate funds from
research departments in order

to prevent an increase in‘

tuition or a decrease in Pitt
financial aid.

Pitt should be grateful that
we have a strong, progressive
union of graduate students
taking preemptive action to
prevent the corporatization of
our university. In the future,
grads and undergrads will
unite together with an
indomitable spirit and soli-
darity, preventing profiteer-
ing administrators from again
empowering themselves on
elitist pedestals that are so
high up that they become
deaf to US, the real indis-
pensables of the university.
Dan Weiss is a columnist for
The Pitt News.

Pitt News, written by the editor
in chief, I expect him to take
his responsibility a little more
seriously. Anybody who has
done the least bit of reading on
NAFTA understands that if
there is one country that has
benefitted from this deal more
than any other, it’s the U.S. I
ask the editor in chief not to
buy into the same “sensational-
ism” in the mass media that he
derides throughout his column.
By that I refer to the constant
amount of false accusations by
Buchanan and the like (Ross
Perot) that jobs will “ﬂy out of
the country.”

“ This brings me to my second .

and final contention. NAFTA
represents the only true long-
term solution to the border cri-
sis between the U.S. and
Mexico. Yes, Mexico will ben-
efit from NAFTA, and that is
anything but a bad thing for the
U.S. Only when Mexico has
developed economically and
there is no longer the incentive
to illegally immigrate into the
U.S. will there be a viable situ-
ation in between the two coun-
tries.

Anyone who believes that a
wall will stop this immigration
probably believes as well that
stopping drugs is best done by
going to the suppliers. As long
as there exists a demand, some-
one will supply. As long as
there are such striking econom-
ic differences in the two coun-
tries, they will ﬁnd a way into
this country.

Baseball begins Big Est season I-3

By Brad Isles
Sports Editor

Pitt baseball carried a six-garne winning streak into 5

last weekend when it took to the road for doublehead-
ers against Villanova and Georgetown in the Panthers’
ﬁrst Big East games of the season.

However, Villanova put an abrupt halt to the

Panthers’ momentum on Saturday, downing Pitt 9-8 in *

game one and 8-5 in game two. »

In the ﬁrst game, the Panthers jumped out to a 3-0
lead in the third, only to be countered by four Wildcat
runs in the bottom half of the inning. Trailing 8-5 in the
top of the seventh, Pitt rallied to re-tie the game at eight
apiece, sending the game into extra innings. VV1th two
outs in the bottom of the eighth, Villanova scored the
winning run.

Pitcher Mike Rohrbach got the loss, dropping his
record to 2-1. Jason Conti led the Panther offense,
going two for ﬁve with a double. He also stole two
bases increasing his total on the year to 17.

Villanova second baseman Steve Young went four
for ﬁve with ﬁve runs batted in to pace the ‘Cats.
Villanova 8, Pitt 5

In the second game, Pitt once again broke out to an
early lead, scoring four runs in the second to make it 4-
1. But Villanova countered, scoring two runs in the
fourth and two in the sixth for the win.

Wildcats pitcher Trevor Pepkowski went the dis-
tance, only allowing three Panther hits the entire game
while striking out 12. ’

‘‘He’s been starting since he was a freshman,” Conti

Two veterans led the Pitt
men’s and women’s track
teams at the first team scoring
event of the outdoor season, the

; weekend at the University of.

Actually, only the relay races
counted in team scoring, but
that’s where Pitt did well. The
men finished seventh with 15

‘Tonya Mullins was the star of
the day for the women. Mullins
was on two first—place relay
teams (400-meter relay and
shuttle hurdles) and another
relay team, the 200-meter relay,
which very nearly won, and she
finished 10th in the pentathlon.
“She demonstrated her lead-
ership and the importance of
her to this team,” Head Coach
Steve Lewis said. “Anything

Mullins ran the anchor leg of
the 200-meter relay team,
which had a victory stolen
from it. Approaching the last
leg of the relay, officials put
Mullins in the wrong lane to

receive the handoff from Ayne

Allen. Asa result, Allen had to
run about 15 extra meters
before the handoff, costing Pitt
valuable fractions of a second.

Lewis said. “The first three
legsran fantastic.” _

Pitt’s 200-meter relay team
of Trecia Smith, Najuma
Fletcher, Allen and Mullins ﬁn-
ished eighth in 1:37.73, less
than one second behind the
fourth-place team from
Mississippi State.

Mullins also led off the 400-
meter relay team. Mullins,
Angie .Martin, Joetta Purter and
Allen won the race by a com-
fortable 2.57 second margin,
ﬁnishing in 3:44.99.

The Pitt women also won the
100-meter shuttle hurdle relay.
Smith, Mullins, Shana Fadis

and Fletcher won the race in
57.12 seconds. Pitt’s B—team
finished fifth in the race.

In the heptathlon, four Pitt
women qualiﬁed for the ECAC
championships. Fletcher won
the event, Smith was second,
Mullins was 10th and Megan
Ferrara was 15th. Naeemah
Withey and Gennifer
Washington were 16th and
17th, and both just missed
qualifying for ECAC’s.

The women’s 27 points put
them only three points behind

Mullins’ counterpart on the men’s
side was Orrel Green. Green ﬁnished
eighth in the 110-meter hurdles with
14.67 seconds and third in the 400-
meter hurdles with 51.42 seconds, beat-
ing the defending national champion in
the event and qualifying for the IC4A
championships. _

Green also worked hard on relay
teams.

“He ran tremendous legs in the sprint
relay and the mile [4x400 meter] relay.
He had a great, great meet,” Lewis said.

Green was on the men’s 110-meter
shuttle hurdle relay team, helping the
squad to a 59.10 second-place perfor-
mance. The team finished second
despite the absence of Curtis Anderson,
who is practicing with the football
team.

The men’s 400-meter relay team of

Tim Tyre, Green, Jay Murphy and Jay
Jones ran the fastest time by a Pitt team
in two years, 3:11.81. They ﬁnished in
sixth place.

Jones also ran strong legs on the 100-
meter relay and the sprint medley.
Murphy lowered his time in the 110-
meter hurdles to 14.18, finishing in
third place.

Several other individuals had good
days, qualifying for championship
meets. Ron Losiewicz qualified for
IC4As in the discus, notching his per-
sonal best throw, 157-8. Ed Adarnson
qualified in the 3000-meter steeple-
chase with 9:16.94, and Jerel Williams,
who has been injured, came back with
a qualifying performance in the 400-
meter hurdles. Williams finished 10th
in 53.06.

Pitt finished_seventh as a team with
15 points. Mississippi State won the
meet with 24.

Villanova.

“We beat them last year,
so we want to do the same
again. As for myself, I’m
working on my consisten-
cy and coming into the net
at the appropriate time,”
said Siegel.

For Davis, Villanova is
important, but she is also
looking forward to the Big
East Championship on
April 18. '

“As a whole, We’re all
progressing well,” Davis
said. “For me, I was in a
slump for awhile, but with
all the practice, I’m get-
ting stronger.

So far, the team’s record
is 8-7, and they have six
more matches to go.
