Funeral Tomorrow

For Dean Friesell   7

H.
School of Dentistry since 1904, willbe held at 2 p. in. tomorrow
at H. Sampson’s Funeral Home, 537 Neville St. Dr. Friesell died
Saturday at his home in Murrysville, Pa.. at the age of 73.

More than any other individual, Dean Friesell has been ‘credited
with r’aising the standards of the University’s dental courses and of,
‘ dentistry,

Edmund Friesell, dean of the

especially
Pennsylvania.

He ‘was born in "Pittsburgh in
1873 and received his degree of
D.D.S. from the Pennsylvania Col-
lege of Dental Surgery in 1895. A
member of the national Dental
Educational council. for more than
25 years, Dr. Friesell was a foun-
der of the American College of
Dentists, has served as president
of the leading dental associations
of the state and nation, and was a
member ofljthe leading dental re-
search committees throughout the
world.

He carried on extensive
search on dental caries and con-

in Western

, tributed widely to dental litera-

ture. He personally ‘collected as"
large part of the University’s den- ,
tal library and museum, one of
the most complete and valuable
in the nation.

Dr. Friesell was a member of

Delta Tau Delta, Omicron Delta”
..Kappa, Scabbard and Blade, past

supreme grand master of Psi

Omega, past president of Omicron-x 

Kappa Upsilon, and a thirty-sec-
ond degree Mason. “

It was largely through his ef-
forts that the School of Dentistry
became an‘ integral part of the

University. In 1905, one year after '

Dr. Friesell had been named the
fourth dean of the dental depart-
ment, the department was moved
from its cramped quarters at 1003
Penn avenue to what is now the
School‘ of Pharmacy building at
the corner of Pride and Bluff
streets.

In answer to the insistent plead-
ings of Dean Friesell that the den-
tal department should be made an
organic part of the University for
the sake of professional standing,
the Board of Trustees ﬁnally
agreed to assume ycharge of the
dental department and its proper-
ty. From that date, October 5,

- by Bill Aul

A most unbelievable thing hap-
pened to me today. Yes, I know
the Owl is coming out in June
this year, but this is -something
else. As I was about to go out of
:Loc_ker Room No. 1, a girlicame
in. She held thedoor open for
me: I said, “Thank you.”

That’s about all there is to write.

about this week. The power strike
is over now, and most everyone
realizes by now that Pitt is a bit
overcrowded, so that phase of our
life (?) ‘no longer interests any-
one. ‘

At one time it was easy. You
just scouted around looking for
something fantastic or sensational.
Now, you have/to look for the
common place. So many abnormal
conditions have become normal
that any normal event seems rath-
.er shocking. In the dear dead days,
,Joe College sat on‘ ﬂagpoles and
ate goldﬁish for publicity—or was
37 it breakfast? Today he goes with-
out a haircutand makes the head-
lines across the nation. Times have
really changed. ,,

That poses the problem: How
does one get to know the import-
ant people, known variously as
BM or WOC’s, BTO’s, or “Sorry-
'I’m—too-busy-to-say-hello” boys?
Well,‘ you don’t, unless you, too,
are important.

Now our problem is easier. All
We have to do is become import-
ant. But suppose—_this is fantastic
--let’s suppose that we have a_
knack for remembering names.
Then we are defeated before we
begin, because it is impossible to

L

 be important with an affliction like

that. Anyone who can remember
‘a person’s name and feel free to
speak to him after only two in-
troductions should forget. about
ever ‘being Mr. Joseph College,

 vHe is doomed to four years,

of being plain Joe School, Nonent.

, The first step is to take a speech‘

course . to improve your diction.
Do you see now why so few en-
gineers are BTO’s?. Once you are
important, you try to forget
speech, and while you are work-
ing..up, you acquire a habit of ig-
noring anyone to whom you have
been introduced less than three
times. Start smiling to them after
they are mentioned in- Pittpourri,
of course, but don’t consider them
”' nds ’til they ignore you.
“C’s got where they are by

, ‘reusing to speak to ‘people who

 

 

spoke to them in their pre-BMOC
d

who ignores you; because, chances
are, he is more important than
you. A

To get serious for about ten sec-
onds, none of this applies to the
true Big Man, the friend of every-
one, he of the sterling charactei*
and the unselﬁsh service, the ODK
man. No, only the would-be BMOC
need follow this routine, only the
guy who’s afraid he isn’t- import-

ant but really believes he is. Now, i-

aren’t you glad you are really im-
portanti

Need a little more material, so
I may as well answer Catrow and
Thompson. They are the best sub-

ject I can think of for this part »

of, the column. Catrow——I_ think

it’s Catrow. He’s the smaller of -the \

two isn’t: he?—-—C.atrow complains
that I have lost what he calls my
sarcastic humor. He just hasn’t
been speaking to any of my for-
mer friends. I can’t understand it

though, I see his former friends. ,1

From the editor’s note that'ac-
companied Pittpoorri last week, I
take it that they are having a
little trouble finding material for
their "colym.” I forthwith supply
them suflicient for the rest of the
semester: Seen in the Tuck shop
last week (any given week) were
—-(here you mention the names of
fifteen" fraternity men and "fifteen

fraternity women. That should in-.

clude about ﬁfteen names——i-n
round ﬁgures. Add to this ‘list 370
others, start a feud with the guy
who struggles all by his lonesome
on Tuesday and your column
writes itself.) By that time you
should be important, too.

Gaeth Speaks Friday‘
On Nurenberg Trials

On Friday at 10:40 a. m. Arthur»

Gaeth, noted correspondent, will
speak on the “Nurenberg Trials”
in the Stephen Foster memorial.

The only radio commentator to
report the recent executions of

top Nazis at Nurenberg, Mr.
Gaeth covered the trials as chief
correspondent of the Mutual

Broadcasting system. Dr. Stanton
C. Crawford, dean of the Col-
lege, in chage of the event, term-
ed it,. “an unusual oppor unity to
hear recent news-of Europe.”

Speaking from a background of
experience extending over two
decades in Europe, Mr. Gaeth has
spent the past year covering the
Peace conference, elections, and
trials, including that of General
Mikhailovic in addition to the
Nurenberg trials.

Mr. Gaeth previoL.sly visited

described the Cathedral of Learn-
ing and its nationality rooms in
two network broadcasts.

During the critical years from
1926 to 1936, Mr. Gaeth was in
Germany, Austria, and Czech-
oslovakia where he became close-
ly associated with government
and educational leaders. More re-
cently he spent two months cov-
ering the San Francisco confer-
ence and this year received the
ﬁrst interview granted by Yugo-
s1avia’s Marshal Tito.

Born in Milwaukee, Mr. Gaeth
began his career by broadcasting
in German over Radio East Prus-
sia and in 1933 began his ﬁrst
regularradio news broadcasts in

the Czech language over Radio

Prague and Radio Bruno. A vet-
eran of the American lecture
platform, Mr. Gaeth broadcast

over Utah’s Intermountain net-.

work from 1939 until 1943 when
he began daily coast to coast pro-
grams over the Mutual Broadcast-
ing system.

Vets’ Wives
Are Lonely

In addition to crowded housing
facilities and a limited budget,
another problem confronting the
wife of a school—going -veteran is
combating loneliness during the
hours her husband spends at
school or studying in the evening.

With the increased enrollment
of veterans this semester, the Vet-
erans association, along with the
YWCA and the YMCA, is spon-
soring a program planned to in-
clude the wives of all the veterans
‘attending the University.
program is designed to arrange for
small groups of women to meet in-
formally during their free time to
discuss" their ‘common problems-—-
home decorating, menu planning,
even ﬁnding “baby sitters.” ,

Information on the program is
available at .the offices of the
YWCA, 12th ﬂoor, and the YMCA,
8th ﬂoor.

10-8 victory. That’s the story of

in stunned silence when a last—second ﬁeld goal gave Purdue 21

Pitt’s loss to Purdue.

Purdue tallied early in the second period when Bob Pfhol slam-
med over from the one—yard line,¢ .

culminating a drive which had
started on the Panther 43. Henry
Stram hustled in to add the extra
point. ’

Midway through the second
stanza, Leo Skladany, Pitt left
end, trapped Bob DeMoss in the
Boilermaker end zone for a safety.

John Lafrankie started the Pan-
thers on their way by intercepting
a Galvin heave and romped to the
Boilermaker 28. A fourth-down
pass, Lee to McPeak, failed and
Purdue took over on downs. Set
back by two penalties they punted
and Pitt set sail from their own 43.

Lee tossed to Skladany for 32
yards and a ﬁrst down on the
Purdue 27. Abraham, Bruno, and
DePasqua» picked up 18 yards in
Bruno banged over
from the nine in three tries. Cec-
coni’s attempt for the extra point
was wide.

With two minutes remaining,
McKay covered a Panther fumble
on the Pitt 43. A DeMoss to Mc-
Kay aerial carried to the 14. Three
tries carried to the Pitt 10 and
then Stram came in again to split

’ the uprights from the 19-yard line.

squad was unable to‘ provide any
serious opposition and succumbed
to the ﬂeet_-footed Panthers by a

Indiana Host
To Panthers
This WeeI<end ’

By John Golightly

Indiana’s anything but hotshot
Hoosiers will ﬁeld a better team
at Bloomington this Saturday than
their record would indicate.

If Coach Alvin “Bo” McMillin
could put a few handles on the
pigskin, his proteges might have
fared better than three wins and
three losses. Indiana has averaged
six fumbles per game, with the
opposition averaging three recov-
eries.

Despite their generosity, the
Hoosiers have amassed a respect-
able offensive record. They show
a net ‘gain of 128 yards per game
from passes with a total of 60
completions in 134 attempts. Quar-
terback Ben Raimondi — the Kid.
from Brooklyn -— now holds ﬁrst
place in the nation with 33 con-
nections on 67 heaves.

On the ground, Indiana has av-
eraged better than 142 yards per
game. The running attack is led
by Pete Pihos, former all-Ameri-
can end now playing his second
season at fullback, and Bob Cow-
an, who in 1940 set a new high
school scoring record in Indianag
Previous holder of the record was
Michigan’s Tom Harmon. Cowan
also handles the punting.

B Squad Sunk?
By Navy JV’s

The Panther junior varsity
football squad is still looking for
its ﬁrst win after last Friday’s
game with the,Navy B squad at
Annapolis. The Middies tripped
the Pitt Cubs, 13-0.

The tussle wasn’t so one-sided.

as the score indicated, according
to Coach Ralph Mitterling.

The game was fairly e“ven until
late in the second quarter, the
two teams battling "each other
around midﬁeld. A few minutes
before the end of the ﬁrst half, a
Pitt pass from deep in its own
territory w_as intercepted by Plebe
Bob Morr and he promptly scooted
over for the touchdown. The con-
version was good and the halftime
score ‘read Pitt 0, Navy 7. -

The second lialf started out to
be a fair imitation of the ﬁrst ex-
cept’ that midway through the
third period, Morr grabbed the
ball and went around end from
the 50-yard line for a touchdown.
Again the Middies converted and
that ended the afternoon’s scor-
ing. Late in the game the Pan-
thers rallied and punched out two
sustained downfield drives. How-
ever, Navy bounced back and
stopped the marches at the three
and later the ﬁve-yard stripes.

Coach Mitterling was especially
lavish in his praise of backs Ken-
nedy and Becker. Both young-'
sters are coming along ﬁne and
according to all indications will
probably move down the hill to
join the varsity before the end of
the season. "
