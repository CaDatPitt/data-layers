General Matthew B. Ridgway

Excerpts of the speech, which

(Quoting the Charter of the
“ ‘We, the people of the
United Nations,’ the Charter be-1
gins, ‘determined to save succeed-

“of war, reafﬁrm faith in funda-

mental human rights, in the dig-
nity and worth of the human per-
son, in equal rights of men and
women, and of nations large and
small, . . . to practice tolerance,
and to live together in peace’.” »

Lofty Concepts Listed

General Ridgway continued aft-
er. reciting part of this Charter,
“These are lofty concepts. They
enable those who believe in them

They contain much

idealism , too much, some cyn’ics

Hardman Tells
Activity Card’-s
Meaning, Uses

Further clariﬁcation ‘is
needed of the use‘ and origin
of the student activity card,
according to Jack Hardman,
assistant to the dean of men.

Unlike most universities,
Pitt» students receive the bene-
ﬁt of the student activity card
without paying an activity fee.
Hardman said that many students
believe the $12.50 University Fee
is their payment for the activity
card, thereby entitling them to the
privilege of transferring the card
to a friend for various events.

' _ Card Is Free

As outlined in the University

Bulletin, 5.73 ‘per cent of the

eral student activities fund.

The card provides the student
with admission to athletic events
and various other activities that
are announced from time to
time. It also includes a subscrip-
tion. to the PITT NEWS. :

The University Fee is applied
only to a special fund for the pur-
chase of land, _ construction. of

ment and other purposes that the
Board of Trustees may authorize.

The Dean of Men's Office. sug-
gests that each student read the

the activity card. By complying
with these regualtions the student
will help the University keep its
present system for providing the
students with the maximum activi-.-

ties from the card’s use.

Ridgway Against Wilson

By Ed Bachmon

The present Russian “Sweet-
ness-and-Roses” campaign seems
to be catching, many of use in a
willing mood. Willing to’ ease up,
willing to forget’ Cominunistic po-
tential, w i 11- —

jump at any chance that the men
who pull the strings in Moscow
may be sincere. But is it worth
letting our guard down? Is it
wise leading with our chins until
we can be more conﬁdent of the
situation in the world around us?
One of the major points of
controversy these days concerns
our‘ national defense. Just how

 

much-—-if anyeshould we cut the‘

strength. of our armed forces at
this time? The answer to this
' just doesn’t appear on‘ the visible
surfa'.ce..
Ridqway. Wilson Split .
Many of our prominent na-
tional ﬁgures‘ have felt that they
have an answer to what deter-
mines an adequate national de-
fense. Probably one of the most
famous “splits” on this issue has
been between General Matthew

.   Letters To The. Editor

B. Ridgway and Secretary of De-
fense Charles E. Wilson..
General Ridgway has strongly
opposed the,.recent Administra-
tion cutbacks of armed forces
strength. As Army Chief of Staff,
he made his opinions known
quite often. He is not the only

'top" level military authority to
‘feel the same way. '

W h il e ., the Administration
naturally . is. concerned w i t h
meeting a budget (a comical at-
tempt, recent history has proved)

A our top military men have com-

plained vehemently about cut-

ting the. military budget in order

to meet other expenses.

Won"! Change Opinion
During the‘ Pitt News inter-

view last week, Gen. Ridgway

renewed his feeling on this sub-
ject. He said he won’t change his
opinion just because someone
objects to spending money on na-
tional defense. He feels it is a

dangerous thing to cut the mili- .

tary budget when there continues

‘such a threat from the Com-

munistic section of the world.
Three days before his retire-
ment from the Army last June 30
Gen. Ridgway wrote a letter to
Secretary Wilson in which he
pleaded -for “stronger ground
forces in, being”, and was. against
“overemphasis on air power.” He
also said that “the time of the
biggest danger will come be-
tween 1958 and 1962,; when Com-

~munists may be able to inflict

Dear Block “P” Members:

Congratulations Pitt! The spirit
of the students shown at the
Nebraska game was a positive
indication of what a cooperative
student group can do.

The credit belongs to the

Athletic Department for its gen- _

critical damage on the US.”
Mr. Wilson pointed out _to the

organization, the Pitt News for
publicity, and to our committee
and row leaders for hours of
work. But we owe our greatest
thanks to each student who par-
ticipated in the “Block”. We hope‘

you enjoyed working as a mem- _

asked for more cooperation and

Vigorous Two Acts ~
‘Set in a resplendent 1890 living room, the play‘
carries on vigorously through the ﬁrst two acts.
The very funny buildup to the third act climax is
handled like clockwork as situations develop-.
Despite some extenuating conversation between pa
and Minister Fieﬁeld in which the sophist de-
scribes his life’s phi1osophy—“Morality is merely _
a matter of geography”—he provides convincing
arguments to spur on robust performances from

We could accept pa’s ideas if one could profess
such a philosophy and still not accept the morality _
of the community in which he lives. ' -S

However, the Playhouse thespians can’t over-
come an author’s defect and they plunge from the
heights of rhetoric as pa’s‘ whole philosophy cracks‘
from the one bland question or a free-thinking
éhild, “Why didn’t you tell us sooner?”
adequacy of the man to provide an answer is a.
considerable let down. _ V v

Gert Gridiron and Paul Pigskin haven’t missed a Pitt
_ _ home. game in two years. At the Nebraska game Saturday,
 ; Gert and Paul were seated as usual on the 35-yard line
,_‘_.{._«4.vatching the proceedings onthe ﬁeld. '
 ~ g It was. early in the second half and Pitt was marching
” : upﬁeld with the ball. After a couple of plays, the Pitt. full-
. back carried the ball into the line for the ﬁrst touchdown.
,.This caused Paul to hop to his-feet and give out with, “Yea
Pitt’,_,”, while waving his pennant. I .
, Gert calmly reached up and pulled him down by the
. sleeve of his jacket. “Don’t get so excited; he only scored
. two yards.” ‘ . , _
. ' At this, brother Pigskin went into an oration as to why
»it was so important to get the ﬁrst touchdown. “You see,
if we don’t get a ﬁrst down Gert, .we’ll have to punt,.etc_.,
*etc.” . , . »
Two -ﬁrst downs later, Gert turned to herexuberant grid
expert and, pointing to the Pitt quarterback, asked, “Paul

orvsomething? He hasn’t lifted it over his head all ‘after-
noon.” - ' _ i a
V This puzzled brother.Pigskin. “No, hisj arm’s’ not
sore.. Whatmakes you think so?” . ' . ' ‘l V
 ‘fWell,_’f came back Gert, ,‘‘If it’s. not, I don’t see why.he
_doe_sn’t-‘ throw the ball sometime‘ insteadof always making
‘those other poorfellows run into the whole Nebraska team
' 'ith it.” . ' V '
aw Paul cleared his throat and launched into a dissertation
on the ﬁner points and strategies of football. _“-Let me ex-
'7" plain Gert dear. You see, the Pitt coaches probably feel’ that
asjlong as they can gain yardage on the ground, theres no
sense‘ in passing.” . . . ‘. ' ' _‘ .
' _' A , And then, leaning over secretive-like, Paul whisper- _
ed, “Besides, we don’t- want __to show Duke anything we
don’t have to. Weill probably pass the devil 0111 Of them

‘deep in Nebraska territory. The fans had taken up the _Ché_111’€,

the 27-30 loss to the Wildcats may
have done more «good for his
proteges than harm. With the
pressure of upholding a 20 meet
win streak gone,‘ the harriers will
be free of tension. ,

Familiar Course \

In addition to this, Olson‘ be-'
lieves that 5 the“ Cadet, course is
more adapted. to the Panther’.s
style of running than the Villa-
nova trail was. It is,__very hilly
which should make the locals feel
right‘ at home. ’

Another. reason‘ for optimism,
Olson believes, is the return to,-
form' of Jack Shubert who was a
sparkplug of‘ last year’s undefeat-
ed aggregation. Shubert had not

"started ‘a meet until the Villanova

tilt and he ﬁnished sixth against
the toughest competition to date.

Shubert’s comeback: has been
the cause of considerable compe-
tition among the team members

Spiess Stuies l*u1t Fly Hre Speaks Here Oct 20 

By JACK OLENDER 6 0

The Atomic Energy Com-
mission, in its broad program
to study the effects of radia-
tion on the heritary genes,
made a grant last February
to this University. The Pitt
project, which is headed by
Dr. Eliot B. Spiess, does not deal
directly with the genetic efforts of
radiation, but does fit into the big
picture the AEC is trying to de-
velop. _

The AEC, through a network of
research projects, hopes to learn
more about radiation effects (such
as result from atomic bomb fall-
outs) upon the heredity of man.
Since fruit ﬂies are more ex-
pendable and breed at a, faster
rate than man, fruit flies are be-
ing used in these experiments as
