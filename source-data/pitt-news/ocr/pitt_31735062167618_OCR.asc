Buckley Denounces

(SW) 1 (’ll‘S .-lllrllysis, l’rl,r_{r* 8.)

by BILL GROMLEY
. Staff Writer

Conservative par excellence
William F. Buckley Jr. deplored
disrespect for the law in the Uni-
ted States. castigated left-wing
students who refuse to allow
other points" of view to be heard.
and expressed alarm at the na-
tio‘n's steadily increasing crime
rate in an address on October 20
in the Common Facilities Build-
ing. ‘ '

Quoting the Federalist Papers,
the prominent editor of the Na-

, tional Review recalled the fears
our Founding Fathers harbored
towards "private licenti'ous-
ness. against which no con-

-stitution is proof." Buckley ex-
pressed confidence in current-

change and,

Gore Vidal‘s frequent sparring
partner made it clear that he re-
gards the recent proliferation of
individual acts of civil diso-
bedience as symptoms of a pro-
found national problem. "The ap-
parent inability of the community
to cope with disorders." he sug-
gested. "may derive in part from
the community's unwillingness to
to so.“

Reserving special opprobrium
for lawbreakers. the author of
seven books wryly observed.
"Lawbreaking has become a life
style for some; individuals}?
Singling out Dr. Benjamin Spock,
the Reverend William Sloane
Coffin-. and those who partici-
pated in last year’s sit-in at Col-
umbia, Buckley lambasted len-
ientcourts and tolerant univer-
sity administrators.

"The reluctance of the com-

munity to move against law-
breakers." the conservative ideo-
logist argued. “indicates a very

serous weakness.” Dismissing the

oftheard cry of police brutality
as-essentially specious and too
freely used, Buckly described
the behavior of Chicago’s police
force at the 1968 Democratic
Convention as “rather good on

'thewhole.”‘ 1 »

Holdup Man Hits SU;
Officer Delaney Shot  

Tuesday evening at about 11
p.m. Officer Richard Delaney and
Sgt. Hank Wrbas of the campus
security force came upon an ap-
parent holdup man in the lower
level of the Student Union. A scuf-
fle occurred and in the ensuing
confusion, the suspect grabbed
Delaney’s pistol.

Turning on Delany, he fired the
38 cal. snub-nose, hitting the of-
ficer in the chest. The assailant
then fled. and Sgt. Wrbas fired a
shot and allegedly hit the man. I

P. ,

Within minutes, over 20 units
of the Pittsburgh Police, including
K-9 and tactical units appeared on
the scene.vHard helmeted officers
carrying carbines entered the Un-

ing, it was found that the suspect’
had fled. According to witnesses,

In The Megalopolis

”-*4-‘*1  A ‘by DR. WARREN T. HILL
 _ Director, University Counseling Center

, For an individual to “make it” in the megalopolis, he must undergo the kind
5 of growth process which is represented at the extreme by the long—haired, bead-'
ed, sandaled hippies. It is apparent that drugs are the central symbol of the hip-
 ie culture. , _
. What is less apparent is that the kind of’ growth process that underlies hippie-
dam is, in milder forms, pervasive throughout our youth culture. One might call
;,tli'is growth process the “Integrity crisis” in order to denote its central theme, an
-attempt to gain wholeness. It is to be distinguished form the older kind of growth
rocess, often referred to as the “identity crisis.”

 ., The identity crisisiis a state of testing, experimenting, and rebelling, lasting
.[various lengths of time, wherein one has the implicit aim of finally being able to
“accept and affirm adult authority together with the prevailing values, roles, and
=..iris_titutions.
* , In the process of doing so one foncorms to or “tries on” some of the conven-
yional identities that are available until he finds one, or some combination, that
"r suits” him. A person involved in an identity crisis never seriously questions the
elevance or validity of officialdom. His acts of rebellion represent unreflective
and non-serious ventures in defiance of official expectations.

A student will cut a class or break a curfew hour both to experience the de-

'light of being bad and to gain perspective on adult identity through obtaining
:.a sense of counter-identity. Since authority is accepted the rebellious actions

 

n
o.

;are usually accompanied by guilt.

‘ The integrity crisis, on the other hand, refers to a stateiof experimentation
" nd rebellion which involves a suspension of behavior directed toward assum-
*ing and/or trying out conventional psychological identies. ‘

..  In this state an individual is obsessed with “doing his own thing” and eventual-
“lily creating his own identity. Hence the integrity crisis is characterized by a di-
ectionlessstate of being — a state of floating, or, as the hippies say, “hanging
loose.”
A person involved in an integrity crisis does seriously question the relevance
.of’officialdom. If he is a student, his rebellious acts are in’ defiance of academic
Ind social forms which he preceives as hypocritical, blind, or needlessly lim-
" iting. ' _ i
an He cuts the class because the professor is dull and irrelevant. He breaks
the curfew because the rule is abritrary and inflexible. These rebellious actions
re accompanied not by pangs of guilt but by feelings of self-righteousness. -

 Few persons _experience a pure or acute crisis either or identity or of. inte-
'ty. Most experience elements of both kinds of concern. What is new is that
iitegrity concersn are becoming more and more salient and hence are increas-

, _i_igly determining the direction of growth.

 A person in a state of identity-suspension is likely to have most of the fol-

wing attitudes or values toward our present society;“he is apt tohave a strong

yriipathy of spirtual identification with those individuals who have beendispos-
rssessed by the system. '

, ‘He’ is acutely aware of, and hence easily hurt by, the impersonal, control-
ling, regimenting atmosphere of our institutions. He is offended by our society’s
bsession with production-oriented, commercialized materialism.

 -He is suspicious of facile categorization, the supposition that the use of words
nd labels is a relevant means of ‘understanding his surroundings. He enjoys mov-
es,'?‘play_s, and stories not so much for their “message,” plot, or form but xfor‘e
or their style, action, momentary impact, and degree of surprise.

 Hence, the"“theater of the absurd” and the underground movie are forms to
xhich is he attracted, for they embody these qualities. He values individuality
iidfexpression for its own sake, as is represented by the art form called the “hap-
ening.”

He is. very much against violence, for he cannot identify himself that ser-
o_usly‘ with any one point of view; taking any onepoint of view too seriously, he
ealizes is likely to result in violence.

“Hanging loose” also leads to an openess to experience, a willingness at
étleast to participate in it if not to be transformed by it". These values tend to
ead an individual temporarily to “drop out” in various ways and to varying de-
es, both intentionally and unintentionally, from conven- tional ways of perceiving
dbehaving. ,

The various ways of dropping out of convention are legion: Young people
re finding the formerly prestigious vocations in the physical sciences less at-,
ractive and are increasingly choosing the social sciences; for the connotation of
hysics presently inclueds “the bolb,” and the connotation of chemistry presently
ncludes insecticides and the general pollution of nature.

‘E Young people are less attracted to industry with its focus on the traditional
motive" of material production for profit, and increasingly attracted to the -more
dealistic social service occupations.

,,,, Individuals young and old are more dropping out of institutions that are per-
vied as comparatively closed or rigid in order to join other institutions that
-more loosely organized and which afford more freedom of expression.

EDUCATION, 

V Theory

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Editorial Editor

Thomas Aquinas, medieval theologian,
once transcribed, “neither Socrates nor
Christ committed their teaching to
writing because the kind of interplay

that is in teaching is not possible by ..

means of writing.”

This observation evolved from the
writer’s intensive sutyd of educaion.
He arrived at a conclusion since develop-
ed by Marshall Mc Luhan: that the de-
pendence on the printed word has left
education an exercise in memorization
rather than understanding.

Our present educational system re-
flects this train of thought. “Getting an
education”_ has come to mean com-
mitting “logical” series of facts, figures
and theory to memory. ‘

Consequently, the words have ceased
to be symbols. but have assumed meaning
within themselves. Thought does not pro-
ceed’ beyond reading; printed symbols
have become an end rather than a means.
(i.e. Try not to think in words).

_ But since we cannot deal withpthe ef-
fect of printed technology on the whole
of Western thought and language, we’rc
stuck with the situation we’re in —- the
American system of education. We have to
dealﬂwith that.

What would happen if you walked in-
to a lecture hall and the instructor" in-
formed you that you could not take notes,
that he was intending to test what has been
absorbedby the mind rather than what has
merely glazed the surface.

Panic would probably ensue. Students
would be robbed of their role of passive
learner. If an example or. theroy were
presented that was not fully under-
stood, they would be forced to question
until the mind were satisfied.

Professors would be stripped, too, of
their traditional methods of examination
and grading. The only way to discern”
what has been taken in through oral com’-
munication is to give it out through oral
communication. This means that indivi-
dual or small group rap sessions would be
the only valid way to test. \ '

Past grading hierarchies would.have
to be ditched. Can a professor validly
grade ‘a student’s understanding? He
would be grading the mind. And is
true learning‘ anything else but under-
standing? r

Necessarily, any attempt at evalua-

tion would have to be mutual. Can a
teacher realistically fail a student whose
mind cannot grasp what he is communi-
cating? Who’s at fault.? »

The stage’ is set for experimentation, ,

experimentation with grading procedures,

' structures and time. It is not possible to

set a time limit .on learning any
more than it is possible to set a compre-
hension limit on the mind.

\

It it takes nine students a three month I

term to understand seventy pages of

Joyce’s Finegan’s Wake, what’s the dif- 7
ference. Understanding does not come in .

by ANNE DORN
Staff Writer

In the area of education, there is
such a great difference between the writ-
ten word, the spoken word, and the word-
less thought processes, that it is frustrat-
ingly impossible to explain that differ-
ence here. Perhaps you need the ex-
perience of a class like ours —- a seminar in
Finnegan’s Wake — to begin to under-
stand this difference. Students and “tea-
chers” could experience a similar effect
if they used the basic structure of our
course.

There are nine of us who meet Tues-
day evenings, but we attend only when
we want to. Most of us go to every ses-
sion.

We don’t actually “begin” to discuss
Finnegan’s Wake; we drift into it. One
of us throws out a thought or a topic of
research he or she has been doing the
past week.

' Like any other good discussion, one
thought leads to another. Going “off on
tangents” isn’t a sin for us. ‘We’ve found
that we may learn from any topic we
choose to discuss. T

We have no requirements’ for this
course. If we care to write a paper, we
may. We have discovered, however, that
we do research because we want to,
and we obtain better results from report-
ing back to the-group, rather than writ-
ing a formal paper for Lili.

That’s another point. Lil Arensberg
isn’t our teacher — she’s a fellow parti-
cipant. She’s part of the group, and the
group collectively decides what it wants
for itself.‘ Though actual decisions are
made,‘ they are informal and unbinding.
Each of - us may or may not follow
them. However — and this is the most im-
portant point — each of us usually follows
group decisions not because we have to
but because we want to. . '

As an example, I’ll take the most
important decision our group has made —
whether or not to do outside research
(other than critics. ) We had been going
along for a time just discussing the book _
alone. We realized that we could get so
much more out of the course if we did
individual research on topics related to
Finnegan’s Wake and brought our find-
ings back to. the group. We found it to‘
work. The individual does intensified
research on what interests him, and the
group benefits from his experience. We

each feel a dual responsibility togour-'

selves and to the group. We want the
group to shre our learning and we want to
learn on our own. There is absolutely
no formal pressure on us. We grade our-
selves with either an A or a B, only for

. the sake of University rules. There is no ,

feeling of competition, and yet we all
have expressed how each of has spent
just as much or more time on this as any
one of ‘our other courses.

Our learning is increased, enhanced,
and encouraged by the lack of compe-
tition within the group and by the im-
mediate‘oral exchange ,of ideas. From
these qualities of the course com the de-
sire to educate ourselves and commun-
icate with our fellow students.

By the time this column is in print,
our group may have changed some part
of the structure of the course. But that
is the beauty of our type of education. It
is open to changes and fluc_tuations.iOur
minds control the course; it does not con-

, trol us. How can we ever be satisfied

with anything else. ?

Cohen’s Rebuttal

Editor. The Pitt News:

I am again writing to the Pitt
News to clarify my positions
some of which may not have been
developed clearly and some which
have been distorted in Jack Sim-

J mons letter on Monday).

First I will clarify what I mean
by institutionalized racism. To in-
stitutionalize, in the sense of my
letter, is to instill values by con-
ditioning. It is taboo in the U.S..
-for example, for a woman to ex-
pose her breasts in public where-
as in other cultures it is perfectly
normal and acceptable- People
learn behavior patterns by imita-
tion. Racism in the U.S. is insti-
tutionalized by seeing Blacks con-
sistently doing what is considered
to be degrading work, such as bus
boys, garbage men, elevators op-
erators, etc. All white people are
racists, myself included (I never
hinted that I wasn’t) to some de-
gree from the reinforcement of
seeing the Black man’s “place"
in society.

Simmons states that “human
nature”_is one of the causes of ra-
cism. Anthropologists vwill tell
you that there is no such thing as
"human nature.” People will gen-
erally conform to ‘the morestof
their society because they have
been conditioned to do so. For ex-
ample,’New Guines is a cultural-
ly homosexual society and the
people_are homosexuals.

The other cause of racism Sim-
mons states to be that the Black
man is a minority in our society.
So are the Irish, Jews, Italians,
Greeks, etc. but none of these
groups have been so systematical-
ly stripped of their culture and
heritage and excluded from the
mainstream of American life.

I object _to Simmon’s implica-
tion that I am a traitor to Judaism.
First let me interject the Jews do
not constitute a race (there are‘
Black, Oriental and whites among
Jews). Let me say that Jews, as a
community, are traitors to Ju-
daism (the concept of being your
brother’s keeper is spoken on but
not practiced outside of the Jew-
ish community). The mentality
that implicates me as a traitor to
"Judaism would probably call
George Washington a traitor to
England.

Opinion

by BOB GINO ‘

The baiting that I am nihilistic

.and fond of violence is a half truth.

It is true that my reaction to the
"American way of life" is nega-
tive. but (as my letter indicated)
I am more interested in building
a society free from racism. pov-
erty. war and exploitation. Where-
as capitalism (an impure form.
to be sure) has failed in the U.S..
I think socialism would succeed.
As far as violence is’ concerned.
is it not violence to let people live
(?) in rat infested dwellings? It it
not violence that Black people
earn just a bit more than half what
whites earn? Is it nohdegrading
and dehumanizing for Blacks to
see that laws have to be passed in
the 1960’s to insure Constitution-

‘al. human rights guaranteed to

all men nearly two centuries ago?
(Excuse me, the Constitution was
not certain that Blacks were hu-
man.) To combat these forms of
violence, violence may be neces-
sary. To ask people to be non-vio-
lent when a policeman (whose job
entails protecting the power and
property of the ruling class) is
cracking his skull with a club is

I to ask a person not to value his

life. That is a bit too much to ask
of me. If this is what you mean,
Jack. by being, violence prone.
then I am, indeed, prone to resort-
ing to violence.

Newsworthy

Editor, The Pitt News: H
I just received the final edition

I of The Pitt.,News. I hope that it is

not the last one. As parents of a
student at Pitt, I find the paper in-
formative and filled with perti-
nent information. .

It keeps me abreast of the hap-o
penings at theschool. As I am. lo-
cated 500 miles from the Univer-
sity, it is very helpful.

I do not know the full facts in
the controversy, but I hope it is
settled soon. .

Your paper is of excellent qual-
ity and shows quite a bit of effort.

Hope to see the next issue soon.

Sincerely yours.

Conviction, Yes;
But Don’t Impcse It

Editor. The Pitt News:

I desire peace in Vietnam. and
in all other parts of the world. at
the earliest moment. I do not
wish the seeking of that goal to be
the cause of an imposition of total-
itarianism on myself or any per-
son. Therefore. may I submit the
following personal views to your
pages for the consideration of the
University community, students
and. faculty and administration.
before there is another decision to
be made by that community:

"Opposition to the Vietnam
war. support of the Vietnam war.
or some position between these
extremes, now appears to be a
matter of personal conscience.
Whatever conviction an individual
may hold, _it is a reasonable sur-
mise that another person. or per-
sons, may hold an opposite view
with equal sincerity. Therefore.
it would seem to be socially inac-
curate and morally repressiveto
represent the opinionof the Uni-
versity or of any of its large sub-
divisions as leading to an action
which must be imposed on all.

whereas it can be,- in any instance,
but the tyranny of a. majority;
therefore‘: be it resolved that in
its departments and throughout
this Uni.versity, each person, of
whatever status; be left ‘demo-
cratically free to act or not to act,
according to the -individual con-
science of each, who. in his or her

-integrity. deserves the respect

and the consideration of all
others.“

I further believe thatfascism‘

may come from the extreme left
or the extreme right, and that in
our time the provocations of the
extreme left may produce such a
result. I am also of the opinion
that a collusive minority rriay pre-
pare itself on given issues in a
way which gives it the power of
manipulating an unorganized dem-
ocratic society. It is my personal
belief that evidence of this has
been given on two occasions re-

cently in our society, the Univer- ’

sity.
Sincerely,

"Sun? Outshtiries :’New.,s’y

Editor, The Pitt News:

Today, the Sept. 25 edition of
The Pitt News was called to my
attention. notably the first page,
where I was surprised to learn
that The Pitt News "can compete
with the best of other student
newspapers.” First’of all, I am in-

ment. Having read several issues
of the News, I feel that there is
little if any truth in it. I admit, I

.may be prejudiced by the fact that

I worked on the staff of The Cor-
nell Daily, Sun last year. but, this
gives me a little basis on which to
make the statement that The Pitt
News is by no means in the same
class as the Sun, which is general-
ly rated as_ one of the top two pa-
pers (college papers. that is) in
the country.

Second. I would like to add the
statistics for the Sun to those
shown at the bottom of the page:

For most of this decade. people have. been in-

approach. \

Many people are becoming extremely frustrat-

strations and protests. little has changed. To many '

people. non-violence is not the answer.

If peaceful protest is not the answer.'there are
two alternatives: get into the system and change it

ASRC: Curriculum

by DON MARBURY
News Editor

There is an organization of stu-
dents and faculty members on
campus who are examining every
facet of the College of Arts and
Sciences (CA5! and how it af-
fects each one of the students in
CAS.

The Arts and Sciences Review
Committee (ASRCl was formed
last spring by the Undergradu-
ate Council of the College. Com-
posed of six faculty members and
three students. the Committee
was given the responsibility of
reevaluating the entire CAS
undergraduate experience — ad-
missions. curriculum. grading.
advising center. intra-class mech-
anics, living space. and extra-
curricular activities; in other
words they were charged with stu-
dying what happens to and ef-
fects the student from the moment
he applies to Pitt. to the mo-
ment he leaves. 4

The faculty Committee mem-
bers include professors- David
Bramhill (chairman). and David

Houston, Economics; Barrett Man-

dell. English; William Loerke,
Fine Arts; Orlando Taylor, Psy-
chology; and John Townsend,
Physics. Students on the commit-
tee were chosen by the Arts
and Sciences Student Cabinet
and include Michael Fabricant
(chairman of the Cabinet). Ev-
erett Bannister, and Ellen War-
tella. ’

The Committee has been meet-
ing with groups of students, fac-
ulty and other members of the
University community, this year
to formulate their evaulation.
Michael Fabricant stated that
only through student opinion
could any educational reform be
made.

The Committee is in the process
of formulating recommenda-
tions. and will submit a formal
report next term to a series of
groups for approval: first to
the entire faculty of Arts and
Sciences for their approval.

"The only way to push our
recommendations through with-
out them being watered down
will be through student support.“
Fabricant emphasized.

Members of the Committee
stated that the felt they were a
very powerful grouping because
of the lack of disagreement on
important issues and solutions.

Their first recommendation has
been completed and concerns
the educational grading system.
“The Arts and Sciences Review
Committee believes." they
wrote in a statement concern-
ing their recommendation." “that

an alternative grading system.

should be introduced immediat-
ely into the CAS. One approach

. favored." they‘ continued. “is
that the student registersifora -
. course and then“ works» out the-

evaluation he wishes, if any with
his his fellow students and the
professor. After he has register-
ed for 40 courses in four years.
he is givenaB.A.”

They also said in the statement.
that under the proposal, students
would still be free to choose
the present grading system. The
position of the student upon
“graduation” with respect to
employers and graduate schools
was cited as one foreseeable
problem. <

Fabricant commented on this
problem saying.. "but concern-
ing this, we ‘must ask ourselves
what is the function of a uni-
versity; to feed the entire so-

 

DAVID BRAMHALL

ciety or to educate. to increase
the levels of awareness. and to
make the student more humane.
It seems to us. the continued that
graduate schools and business
have created their own evalua-
tive processes. and American bus-
iness has often voiced the opin-
ion that college graduates are
just carbon copies of their pro-
fessors. and are not very crea-
tive."

Wednesday, October 22, 1969—THE PITT NEWS—Page 7

Innovation

In a statement concerning the
rationale on the basis of an un-
dergraduate college. David Bram-
hill (chairman of the committee!
stated that it was arrogant. ab-
surd. and hypicritical to pretend
that education is or can be the
injection of a predefined. uni-
versally appropriate body of
facts. skills. principle. or analy-
tical techniques.

“Rather. he said. "education
means the development in in-
dividuals of effective waysnof
understanding themselves and the
world. and of ways to act in
the world as it undergoes rapid
changef'

He also stated that authority
and "requirements" should come
from within each student. “The
choice of_ subject areas. of ways of
learning in each one. of speed
of learning. of depth and de-
gree of competence should be
the students responsibility."
he continued. '

Brahmill also outlined the
-structure of a proposed new ap-
proach in his statement concern-
ing education. "Outside of the
small groups. he said. “the Uni-
versity should provide a nutrient
broth of learning situations and
tools. of cultural medial of con-
tracts beyond the campus the
campus."

Bramhill‘s ideas included

such things as:

A. Series of lectures on parti-
cular theme. which would re-
semble the best of lecture cour-
ses now given. but not be con-
strained to a particular length.
nor necessarily within the
scope of a single intellectual dis-
apline.

B. Courses (whether lecture.
seminar. workshop. or what-

ever) designed to give a parti-L

cular skill such as
French conversation.
logic. or flute playing.

calculus.
symbolic

C. Products of the arts-plays.
films. dances. music. the
graphic arts. creative writing,
etc. Opportunity to participate
in the performing arts and in
free amateur athletics.

D. Opportunities for in-
volvement in the organizations of
society to further the students
view of needed social change
and institutional innovation.

E. Employment in part-time
or full-time jobs without loss of
intellectual and human con-
tacts on campus. Periods of
work can be integrated into the
learning process.

Fabricant expressed some of 
his philosophies on the educa-» 

tional process saying that primary
and secondary schools would
also have to provoke a self dis-
apline. and timulate. internal
processes. _ , 

“We are too answer orient-

~ ed." he said, and would should be

given four years to quest on
those things that exist around
him." It is up to the Uni-
versity to create the question-
ing student." he concluded, “it

is their obligation and their

duty." V '
T h e s e are some of the

thoughts, goals, and solutions

of the Arts and Sciences Re-

view Committees. a group de-'

signed to change this University
in what they feel will be the
most beneficial way for the stu-
dent. Ideas and comments from
the University community are
urged and should be submitted to
the Committee at their office in

In between puffing a cigar
and sipping from a cup of steam-
mg White Tower Coffe, William
 Buckley, Jr., the man whose
verbal labyrinth is virtually un-
scapable, answered my questions
through a cloud of smoke.

“After mildly criticizing the Viet-
nam Moratorium for stressing
‘peace but not the consequences
of‘peace,.” the editor of National
Review continued. “The mora-
torium tended to conscript the
enthusiasm of the people accord-

Q: Will recognition of the views
of young people lead to lowering
of -the voting age to give youth
a voice within the governmental
process?

A: That argument is frequently
used. It’s an argument that may
prove very dissillusioning if
(research which shows that,‘ the
majority of youth between the

-ages of 18 and 21 are conserva-

tives is correct . . It’s one of
those things that is, roughly speak-
ing, inevitable. I see no serious
argument for it because the argu-
ment that. youth are now more
mature than they were strikes

me as the sort of thing that one_

sort of goese along with without
thinking about it. Onehundred
and fifty years agopeople at
age 20 were married and bring-

(Contimwrl from Page 2)

Clutching a pen as he spoke.
the sharp—tongued orator ex-
pressed dismay at the fact that
"liberal rhetoric no longer start-
les people but rather is taken for
granted." Buckley claimed he
found it impossible to understand
how the same people who were so
upset by the late Senator Joseph
McCarthy could indulge in Vic-
ious personal attacks on former
President Lyndon J ohnson.

While ridiculing Vice-Presi-
dent Agnew’s analysis of the re-
cent Vietnam -moratorium, the
one-time candidate for mayor of
New York lashed out at what he
termed “the obtrusive hypocrisy
in much of the rhetoric” utilized
on the occasion. “One doesn’t
hear them criticizing North Viet-
nam.” he complained. expressing
the opinion that “the empathy
should have been nonpartisan.’-’

As he quoted a statement writ-
ten b.y‘President Nixon on youth’s
disaffection with the American
government, the maverick Re-
publican alluded once again to

. the .“discourtesy” he considers

characteristic of left-wing stu-
dents. Encouraging liberal ideal-
ists to listen to other points of
view, ’ Buckley _ concluded, “It
would be dangerous to deny the
idealism of other Americans.”

A noted publisher in Chicago. re-
ports there is a simple technique
for acquiring a powerful memory
which can pay you real dividends
in both business and social ad-
vancement and works like magic
to give you added poise necessary
self-confidence and greater popu-
larity. _
According to this publisher.
many people do not realize how
much they could influence others
simply by remembering accurate-
ly everything they see, hear, 01‘
read. Whether in business, at so-

ances, there are ways in which
you can dominate each situation
by your ability to remember.

To acquaint the readers of this
paper with the easy-to-follow
rules for developing skill in re-
membering anything you choose
to remember, the publishers
have printed full details of their
self-training method in a new

able only from ﬁreﬂies. Luc/ferin,
an organic molecule also found in
ﬁreﬂies, but synthesizable. Adeno-
sine triphosphate (ATP), a common
energy-yielding substance found in
all living cells.

Those are the three main ingre-
dients in /ampyr/'dae’s love light.
And because ATP is common to all
living cells, university researchers
discovered they could produce an

artiﬁcial glow by mixing luciferin
and luciferase wherever life is
present.

Noting that phenomenon, Du Pont E

scientists and engineers went on
to develop it into a practical ana
lytical system. Correlating the in-
tensity of the artiﬁcial “glow" with
the amount of ATP present in
bacteria, they designed a means of
measuring the reaction.

The result is the luminescence
biometer—the ﬁrst really basic im-
provement in bacteria-counting
methods since the time of Louis
Pasteur. Rather than waiting days
for a culture to demonstrate growth
density, a doctor or technician can

now get a digital readout of bacteria

Other potentially lifesaving uses
for the biometer are being sug-
gested every day—such as diagnos-
ing metabolic rates, enzyme de-
ﬁciencies and nerve damage.

to discover the unknown. inventing
new materials and putting them to

gﬂevolutionary "Tom Paine”



Timely Theatre Experience

Ll

. Were you to garrison
the places you might march over,
in order to secure their subjec-
tion . . . your army would be a
stream of water running to noth-
ing . . . (and) suppose our armies
in every part of this continent
were immediately to disperse,
every man to his home . . . and
engage to reassemble again on a
certain future day; it is clear you
would have no army to‘ contend
with . . . 

A comment by Chairman
Mao? A statement by a Viet
Cong? Very possible. But the re-
volutionary who wrote the above
words was far removed from con-
temporary Southeast Asia in
time and distance. He was Tom
Paine, America’s hero-villain,
describing another successful
guerilla war, the American Re-
volution.

The quote is not a typical in
its relevance to today’s world.
Much that Paine did and said
has ‘meaning today. This is illus-
trated no better than in the play
Tom Paine, coming to Carnegie
Music Hall this evening at 8
p.m. in a presentation co-sponsor-

ed by the Pitt and Duquesne Stu-
dent Unions.

A weird collage of fascina-
ting effects, Paul Foster’s play
brings the past alive, making
it the present. Featuring many of
the same talented cast as when I
saw Tom Paine two summers
ago Off-Broadway in New York
City, the play certainly has re-
tained its successful use of sev-
eral interesting techniques.

For one thing, the barriers be-
tween audience and actors are
broken. A pulsating tempo of pro-
vacative dialogue is interupted as
the east dreas the audience into
freewheeling discussions on cur-
rent problems.

Secondly, the actual text of the
play is interspersed with improvisa-
tion, giving each performance an
originality absent from many
productions.

One might at first be confused
by another brilliant technique of
Foster’s. At times, Paine is pre-
sented in sented in two forms at the
time on the stage. Thirty-seven
year old Paine appears simulatan-
eously as a sixteen-year—old street

boy and a man in his deathbed
agonies. Paine’s personality is
divided into a real self and a repu-
tation, one might quip “And
never the Paine shall meet.”

Trying to synchronize the split

image to create the traditional
hero is very disturbing. Finally,
fact and fallacy, present and past
all slide together as Paine’s life
funnels into a teaming explosion
of fate.

These effects, plus the tastefull
employment of nudity, make Tom
Paine one of the best examples of
the latest in theater. The provica-
tive techniques plus the challeng-
ing content add up to an exper-
ience worth participating in.

Tickets are available at the Un-
ion information Center and at the
door, the charge being $1 for Pitt
or Duquesne ID carriers, $2 for
others.

span, and there are a number of"

five-year, and several ten-year,
survivals of leukemia victims af-
ter treatment.

Freireich stated that 90 per
cent of all children can be cur-
ed with four weeks of treat. How-
ever, in nearly all cases, the dis-
ease will eventually recur.

The doctor was asked it re-
search were being done into the
causes of leukemia, to which he
replied:

“There’s no question that vir-
uses can induce cancer and leu-
kemia in a wide variety of ani-
mals. Among humans, evidence is‘
still circumstantial.

Radiation can induce leukemia ‘

in animals and man. It can also
activiate latent viruses.”

Although the causes of many
cancers are still unknown, Frei-
reich was quick to note that “the
cause of a disease and the control
of a disease are not inevitably
related." That is, one can often
cure a disease by simple treat-
ing the symptoms.

The doctor stated that treat-
ment of leukemia “has improved
considerably, and the outlook for
a leukemia victim is much more
favorable than for one who has,
say, lung cancer.”

The newly formed Relocating
Students’ Organization (RSO)
will hold elections at its second
meeting, October 30 at 7:30 in
the Dining Room A of the Stu-

According to Temporary Chair-
man Michael Edelstein, an ex-
ecutive council, consisting of 14
people, will be elected. An organ-
ization founded to serve the in-
terests of relocates and transferes.
RSO will have two representatives
on the board representing each of
the following: students who have
transfered to Pitt from other uni-
versities, students who have re-
located from Johnstown, Titus-

Bradford campuses.

In addition to these twelve,
a Chairman and Vice-Chairman
will be elected. Those interest-

up petitions in the office of RSO’s

The issue, Trellis says, is not
with the drugs themselves, but
rather with the reasons that
cause students to turn to drugs.
As he puts it,- “we should give
more attention to the causes ra-
ther that the witnessed symptoms
in society.” In other words he

considers the increasing amount '

of drug use by the high school
and especially the college com-
munity as an overall symptom of
the pressures and needs for re-
lease of *the youth of America.
And, as such, he feels that one
must search and try to cure these
problems rather than condemn-
ing students for turning to drugs.

Meredith   To Lecture

James Meredith, the first Ne-
grorn to integrate the University
of Mississippi, will lecture here

- tomorrow, at noon in the SU Ball-

room under the auspicies of the
SU Board.

From the first day in Septem-
ber 1962 that he stepped on to
the campus of the University of
Mississippi as an enrolled stu-
dent, James Meredith became the
focal point of nationao and in-
ternational attention. Surround-
ed by U. S. marshals, the U.S.
Army and Air Force, scores of
newsmen’, crowds of hostile ob-
servers, and groups of jeering
students, Meredity began an aca-
demic year that included two
numerous injuries and
extensive destruction of pro-
erty; _the involvement of the
President of the United States,
the Secretary of Defense, the
Attorney General, and the Gov-
ernor of Mississippi;'and the ex-
penditure of millions of_ dol-
lars.

By the time thatvyear had end-
ed, Meredith has been hailed
as a hero, vilified as a scound-
rel and troublemaker, commend-
ed as a patroit _and idealist,
threatened with murder; he had
been spat upon and ignored;

he has been viewed with awe
and respect — and he had receiv-_
edhis degree from the Univer-
sity of Mississippi.

Having been guarded night
and day, neveralone to enjoy
the simple anonymity of student
life, he emerged from this tumul-
tuous year unchanged in one
vital respect:
staunch individualist, relying ul-
timately upon his own judgment,
unintimidated by the terrible pres-
sures exerted upon him by both
white and Negro groups.

Born
Mississippi, Meredith was one of
ten« brothers and sisters. His
father, who owned his" 84-acre
farm and was a registered voter,
taught his children the falue of
free—thinking, independence,
and self-respect. Of -this early
but lasting influence, Mere-
dith has written: “Of course, I
had known that I_ belonged to a
group that was distinctly dif-

ferent from at least one other»

group, but until I was fifteen I
did not know that my group was
supposed to be the inferior one.
Since then I have felt a personal
responsibility to change the sta-
tus of my group.’.’ '

he was still a -

in 1933» in Kosciusko, I

if

For his last‘
school, Meredith went to St.
Petersburg, Florida, where he
won the American Legion Essay
Contest with an eloquent state-
ment on “Why‘\I am Proud to be
an America.” After his gradua-
tion in 1951, he enlisted in the
United States Sir Force and rose
to the rank of Staff Sergeant. He
married Mary Jane Wiggins in

1956, and spent his last three

service years in Japan.

Following his discharge in

-1960, he returned to Mississippi

and entered Jackson State Col-
lege, a" Negro school, to continue
his formal education and seek a
law degree. While there he ap-
plied for admission to the Univer-
sity of Mississippi. "After receiv-
ing his degree, he /studied poli-
ti_cal science in Nigeria at the
University-of Ibadan, lectured at
major *
and toured Europe and the
Middle East. When he returned to
the United States in 1965, he
entered the School of Law at Col-

’ umbia University and set up resi-

dence in New York City with his
wife and young son.

A dedicated man with a mis-
sion, Meredith never ceases in
his efforts to secure the rights
and privileges of full citizen-
ship for all Negroes, and it was
this‘ sense of mission which
prompted him ‘to embard on his

now famous march in Mississippi. '
a He said the‘ returning to Mis-

issippi ‘without Federal marshals
would be a personal test. Survi-
ving the trip, he felt, might help

»other Negroes to see that .*"if I

can do. it, they can too.” He

, hoped that his march" would en-

courage the 450,000 unregister-
ed Negro voters in Mississippi

to place their names on the '

rolls.

The story of his march has of- '

ten been told. Shot by a white
sniper from ambush, he will
probably carry to his dying
day some of the 75 bird-shot pel-
lets which entered his body.
However, discharged from the hos-
pital, he continued his march‘ —
but helwas badly shaken by the
shooting. It has made him more
militant in his approach to the
Negro situation.

In his lecture, “Racial Peace
in America,” Meredith will pre-
sent his views —- his own, indivi-
dual ideas, he stresses, even
though they are often at.variance
with those of the official Negro
organizations. '

F rash Cut Short

Bye. Martha Hartle

Sports Editor

 

ed streak to six in a row,‘the
Pitt harriers have proved that
conscientious training and con-
fident determination go a long
way to moulding a strong squad.
Making up in depth what they lack
in experience, the‘-long distance-
men have gone up against some
of the toughest track schools in
the country thisyear, and have
‘yet to be bested. '

With only 18. scholarship freshmen football players on
hand this fall, Cub coach Bill Quinter did an excellent
job in molding together his team for last Friday’s game
with the WVU frosh. It’s unfortunate, however, that due to
the lean number of bodies on hand, the already abbrevia-
ted Cub schedule had to be cut short again.

-With several frosh suffering from minor injuries
after the West Virginia ‘contest, the Cubs would have been
lucky to suit up 22 players for the scheduled clash‘ with
Penn State this week. Thus, on Monday, athletic direc-
tor Casrnir Myslinski made the decision to cancel the
contest. To this reporter, the decision was a wise one.
With the team as undermanned as it is, there would be lit-
tle point in making the trip to State College.

Despite the loss to the WVU frosh, the Cubs were

impressive in their lone outing and several individuals stood "

out in particular, both on offense and defense.

,- Quarterback John Hogan was slick both as a ball
handler and runner, gaining 39 yards on keepers before
leaving the game early in the third quarter with an in-
jury. Overall, the Cub offense ground out 263 yards against
a highly touted Mountie defense. Fullback Myron Kunka
was the leading ground gainer for the frosh with 57 yards,
while Reg Frye caught 6 passes for 99 yards.

Defensively, linemen Ernie Webster and Rich Olds-
‘hue, along with linebacker George Feher, were standouts.
And kicking specialist Tim Hornish made good on his
first field goal try, a 27-yarder, which put the Cubs with-
in three points of the Little Mountaineers at the half .

* * * * *

Record-book browsers may have to look twice at the
punt return statistics this fall. Defensive tackle John Ste;

? vens currently holds the season high mark inthat depart-
ment after his 42-yard touchdown gallop with a Tulane-

puntlsaturdayn. Charlie Hall had the previous long return,
a 21-yarder against Navy. '

And ‘speaking of the record books, Tony Esposito’s

168 yards rushing on Saturday is the most for a Panther

back in 16 years, notfour, as previously reported. Esposi-

'to,-who rushed for 164 yards total last year, has almost

tripled that figure already.

*#**.

With the college football season hardly at the half- I
way point, basketball is already in the air. The Pan-.

thers started basketball practice last Wednesday-and floor
coach Buzz Ridl has lined-up a clinic this weekend. Three
hundred district basketball coaches and players are ex-
pected to attend, beginning at 9 a.m. Saturday in the
Field House.

Visiting lecturers at the clinic will include former
Penn State coach John Egli, Ron Cygrymus of Cannevin,

Doug Adams of Michigan City‘, Ind; Larry Foust, former .

pro player, and George Cupples of Fifth Avenue High.

The running gameis often

ment of the big pass play in
football. Fortunately for Pan-
ther followers, Carl DePas-
qua is not an excited fan.

When the Jungle Cat coach ac-
cepted his position, he recogniz-
ed the fact that his gridders
could not successfully penetrate
through the air, and he began
to emphasize the squad’s rushing
game. ' .

It’s too early to say that De-
Pasqua’s plans have worked out,
but even the Panther mentor (and
he always insists that a coach is
never satisfied) admits to a cer-
tain amount of pleasure.

“They’ve (the Panther runners)
been looking real good. That’s
confidence,” he said. “But there’s
still room for a lot of improve-
ment.

“The Line’s been blocking
well and we’ve been improving.
You see, it all depends on the
blocking patterns and the execu-
tion, and our line’s been improv-

ing each game.”

Before the Panther season star-
ted, everyone was telling De-
Pasqua that the offensive line
was his team’s weak spot. He
never denied that, but he took a
“wait and see” attitude which he
continues to possess.

Coach Jim Banner is extremely

A bit part of the Panther suc-

 Cub Season Ends Wlth

 Penn State Cancellation

by EVAN PATTAK

The Freshmen Football season, barely underway, came
fto an abrupt halt Monday when Athletic Director Casimir
Myslinski called his counterpart at Penn State and cancelled
..,Friday’s scheduled game. An inordinate number of injuries
sliced Coach Bill Quinter’s squad in half, and if the game
had not been cancelled, it is doubtfulwhether Quinter would

a_nd never gave up, and but for a‘
few big plays against us, we might
have won the game.”

The back-breaking plays that
Quinter had in mind both occurred
in the second half. The first was
a 35-yard pass off the halfback
option that caught the Cubs nap-
ping and set up the second Moun-
taineer score. The Mountaineers
iced the cake later in the half
when on a third and short yard-
age situation, fullback Tom Zak- .
owski_ plunged into the line, em-
erged unscathed from a pack of
blue and gold clad Cubs, and
rambled 67 yards for the touch-
down. ‘

For Friday Battle;

A Morale High--Fibel

by BILL N AAB

_' The soccermen are prepared to bounce back after suffer-
mg Saturday’s thunderous fall. Come Friday, Leo Bemis’
squad will be at war in the mountains of West Virginia in an
attempt to even their 2-3-1 record.

Freshman goalie Steve Fibel, who has allowed only two balls to
sneak past him in three games, is ready to slap on the wat paint.

“We’ll be up for West Virginia,” he said. “No game is a push- I

over. Any game we lose makes it harder to get" into the playoffs, and
meanwhile we’ve got to be impressive in winning.”

Coach Bemis mentioned that
his squad must be ready to fight
back against WVU after dropping
a disappointing 2-1 overtime loss’
to Ohio University over the week-
end. West Virginia has lost most
of their offensive ammunition
from last season, but (according
to Bemis) they’re big and strong.

“They’re the run—over-you type
of team as far as the defense is
concerned. We’ve got the ability,
butwe always haveto hustle. We
can’t dominate anyone with speed,”
Bemis remarked. In the meantime, .
Bemis expects his team to be
mentally prepared to overtake the -
Mountaineers.

If Fibel’s moral, however, is-
any indication of team morale,
Bemis may have few headaches.
“We’ve got a great team and
momentum. We still have a good
team spirit,” Fibel said. And even
through crowds of soccer enthus-
iasts haven’t caused any recent
traffic jams on campus, Fibel
believes thata winning team will
draw the attention. of collegiate
sportsfans.' i . . F F

 
 
     
   

C PARTY CAKES it

ALL,’ o¢ctAsIoNsz  

In his high school days in
Long Island, soccer was a major
sport. Thus, Fibel misses the
roar of large crowds and the back-
ing of his classmates. “Just 100
kids watching us would psych
us up.”_ He noted, “I couldn’t
imagine playing in front of thous-
andsf’ .

Fibel may never play in front
of several thousand fans, but be-
fore the season began he had to

play behind four goalies. And de- l

spite his freshman status and an

injury which knocked him out of ' 7 

action-for ‘two weeks, Fibel has
strived, to gain and capably fill
the starting goalie position.

Originally ‘Kerry Krause re-

‘ ceived the starting, nod. However,

after just a few contests Krause
suffered a shoulder.sepa__ration.

John Giorgiothen took guard of

the nets, but lost his desire and

“quit after the booters tied a sup-

posedly weaker Cleveland St.
aquad.. Then, ‘Fibel came to
the rescue. ‘

Blasts Stratford 41-6

by MIKE MILLER

Random House once again stole the show trampling Strat-
ford House 41-6 Monday to extend their undefeated record

to three games.

The first score came on a pass from Bib Livingston to Jim Madi-
gan for six points. The kick was no good.

Stratford received the ball and advanced to the 40 yard line. On
the next play Lou Frank stole a pass from Carmen De Stanza.

Paul Quarantillo then lobbed a

.7‘-xyass to Van Krause who ran for

i
i

i

a touchdown. The kick netted
another two points.

The Random defense came on
strong, forcing Stratford to re-
treat into their own end zone
giving Random _a two point saf-
ety and control of the ball.

Quarantillo later completed a«

pass to Livingston for another
six points but the conversion fiz-
zled.

Stratford got on the scoreboard
when de Stanza passed to Nick
Gervase. An attempted pass con-
version failed, and the score stood
at 22-6 in favor of Random House
when the half ended.

 Stratford received the ball at

"' z-he start of the second half. Af-

jter several incompletions, Bob
Madtes snagged a de Stanza pass,
but Stratford was forced to sur-
render the ball on the fourth
down.

Quarantille then fired a TD
pass to Lou Frank but again the
kick was judged as no good.

Stratford received the ball
but lost it on the first play when
Jim Madigan snatched a pass to
put Random on the offensive
again.

After advancing the ball with
4 series of runs and passes. Lou

Frank charged across the goal line
for another six points.

Stratford completed two pas-
ses but failed ‘to achieve a first
down. Random tookover and Van
Krause advanced the ball with
passes to Willie Manteris and
Bob Livingston. Lou Frank snag-
ged a Van Krause pass in the
end — zone to put the final score
at 41-6, with Random House on
top.

THIS CAN GET YOU
HEAD TOGETHE

Don’t let life let you down
because of a silly head-
ache. Happiness is as far
away as an Anacin® bottle.
Anacin is twice as strong

in the specific pain re- 1

liever doctors recom-
mend most as the other
well known extra strength
tablet.

Anacin may not bend
your mind, but it sure will
get your head together.

Moog did for Bach?
i Well dig what it’s doing
for “Jumpin’lack Flash.’’

on are going to do it to you again. Hits like
“Hey Jude,” “The Weight,” “Jumpin’ Jack
Flash” and “Yummy Yummy Yummy.” And
because it’s'al| Moog,you’re going to discover
some sounds you’ve never heard before.

JOHN TABOR, Republican mayoralty candidate, ‘‘I am strongly
opposed to any legalization of mariiuana. Eighty per cent of hard
narcotics users started off on marijuana. The.A'merican Medical
Association has concluded that this indeed is a harmful drug
and that the legalization of it would lead to even more medical
and social consequences than now result from its use. Drug abuse
leads to the breakup of families,’ the turning to crime to support
the habit and even to death.”

 

   
  
    
  
   
 

PETER FLAHERTY, Democratic mayoralty candidate, “l will cooper-
ate closely with the schools in educating young people in the
dangers of drugs and also to help teachers spot addicts and ex-
perimenters among their students. The special narcotics squad
will establish programs whereby parents who suspect their chil-
dren of drug abuse can contact these officers with the assurance
that they will be helping rather than harming their children.”

Forum On Drugs”

Forum (In l)ru,:.,rs

No Closed Doors

by MARC HILLER
Chairman, Forum on Drugs Committee

An Openlnvitation to the Pittsburgh Community:

Another first will take place this coming weekend (Oct. 23, .
24, 25) during the Forum on Drugs. Surely, there have bee.J'>
other programs on- the topic of drugs, but this one will be differ-
ent in many ways. This Forum, open to the entire community,
will stress student involvement and participation throughout its '
entirety. There will be no "sessions behind closed doors and 5
above all students are not being. given a “loaded” program.

For all those who attend, they will clearly see the positive
side of drugs will be given as much attention as well as the well
aired negative viewpoint. There will be no bars put up, none by ,»
the administration and none by the outside community (includ- E
ing the police). - .

Hopefully a most informal atmosphere will prevail and any-
one who has something to say will be invited tospeak his mind.
Leaders on the drug scene will be present and thus the student
body will have an unusual opportunity to question these experts
on a face to face basis. Political leaders, psychiatrists, psy-
chologists, medical doctors, clergy, police officials and above
all “students” will be meeting in a most relaxed atmosphere. 1,

Thus at this very unusual “happening” every person and”: _
every viewpoint will have an opportunity to be heard. No pres-M2’  .
sures will be upon students to take, not to start taking, or to 4’
stop taking drugs or smoking grass. "Most of the known facts
will be presented and undoubtedly debated, opinions will be
heard, and probably many tempers will be flaring, but these
are all great signs . . . at long last students might be getting in-
volved.

_ ’The final choice as to the pros and cons concerning the drug
scene must be left up to us to decide and not to our parents or the
police or Mr. Nixon.

After all, we are the ones involved so let us seek our own
answers; if we feel we need help we know we can get help from
them . . . or can we? We are the ones who stand the most to lose”.
and it is only we (each individual) who must make the decision" 
as to which way to turn.

May I make this final request to all those in the Greater
Pittsburgh community who do care-, who want to get involved, 
and -who may want to hear both the experts’ -and the students’
viewpoints to come to the University of Pittsburgh’s first
“Forum on Drugs” this week. '

' I’d like to take this opportunity to end this invitation with
what I feel isa most appropriate quote from one of the Forum’s
participants, Paul Krassner: “In a democracy people have the
right to choose the way they want to go to heaven or hell as long
as they don’t make anyone else-go on their trip.”
