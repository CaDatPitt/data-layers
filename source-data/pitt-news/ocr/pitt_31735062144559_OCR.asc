ready to co-operate with all the
hospitals. Establishment of this dis-
pensary means that the medical cen-
ter now being built at the University
will be, in a ﬁne and true sense, a
great health center as well.”
Maurice and Leon Falk have fre-
quently evidenced their interest in
humanitarian movements. They have
been associated with the Federation
of Jewish Philanthropies since its
inception and are trustees of this
organization which correlates the
charitable work of seventeen social
agencies.

Both at the University and in med-
ical circles it was said that there is
acute need for such adequate, mod-
ern dispensary facilities ‘as. the
Falks have now provided for~Pitts-
burgh and Western Pennsylvania.
Five years ‘ago, the University ef-
fected a co-operative ‘arrangement
with the_Pittsb’urgh -Free Dispensary,
Fernando street. At that time » the
number of patients received at the
dispensary was 5,000 annually. Last
year 40,000 were cared for. Limited
facilities have prevented an even
larger growth. The new dispensary
is planned to care for a much larger
number of persons. _

The work that the modern dispen-
sary does was described last night
by Dr. R. R Huggins, dean of the
University medical school:

“The modern dispensary results
from demand that more time be de-
voted. to the study and care‘ of pa-
tients. Init all manner of labora-
tory. and clinical aids are utilized_In
the» diagnosis of « disease and with
this is associated social service in
all its manifold possibilities. The
dispensary, thus organized, seems
destined to become a great factor
in the maintenance of ' community
health, especially through the early
detection of disease and its preven-

tion. ,

“The greatest appeal that comes
from this work is theknowledge that
the’ service is primarily for the un-
fortunate individuals in the com-
munity. Here they may come, and
receive every beneﬁt known to mod--
—ern medicine. ‘
sciences of chemistry. bacteriology,
pathology and all the specialties
stand ready, in co-operation with co-
workers in medicine and surgery, to
give‘ their best care and attention to
the man, woman or child without
money or without friends.

“Here one finds‘ every kind of a
specialist, every modern aid in diag-
nosis, and all known methods which
may be employed in the care and
treatment of the sick. All this the
_dis ensary established by the Falks
wil do.” ' . _ * , 

Dean Huggins said that the dis-
pensary will be invaluable In the
trainin of physicians for Western
Pennsy vania. “In one year in the
dispensary the young student may
learn as much from observation of
skilled diagnosis and treatment as

OTHERS COMMENT

“The Falk giftsprings from_-ﬁne
humanitarian impulses, a desire to
do good, and from a clear ‘vision of
a need and an opportunity,” declared
Arthur E. Braun, chairman of the
medical committee of the trustees of
the University- “The wisdom and

BLASTERS’ HANDBOOK

_ .1-IE economicadvantagcs of blasting ditches with
dynamite warrant obtaining a practical under-
standing of the methods commonly used. Blasting
ditches cost less; the soil is evenly distributed on either
side of the ditch; no spoil banks are created because
the explosive distributes the earth and makes the
ditch where required; no expensive machinery to locate‘
and operate; there are no overhead expenses for equip-
ment; ditches can be dug with dynamite where 
conditions are too difﬁcult for other methods, and,

ﬁnally, the process is so simple.

Do you understand the propagation method of ditch blasting?
Do you know the proper way to load, the amount of charges, the

kind of explosives to use for each kind of ditch?

All "these questions are completely and practically answered in 
_masters  There are tables of charges, plans for load-
Aug. cross-section views. and concise instructions for every step.

to his mother, hid his head and smarting eyes under the comforting
darkness of her leathery wings, and just against her warm‘, throb-

bing heart.

MORE’ ANENT KEYS
The following parody came
to us from an alumnus, in-
terested as ono who was an un-
dergraduate “all keyed up” and
“wore them all.” A plan for a
standardised key for all stu-
dent activities ‘was presented
several weeks ago to the of-
ﬁoe of the graduate manager o
non-athletic activities, provi -
ing that each student may re-
ceive but one key, inscribed
with the name of his activities
and supplanting individual keys
now awarded.

PITT “NEWSIE,” COLLEGE SENIOR,
PLA YS VIOLIN, WRITES FOR PAPER

Although newsboys are commonly
of grade school age, one “newsie,”
of college age has been found at
Pitt. , '

Charles A. Rohleder, a senior,
maintains a thriving newsstand in
Federal street, Northside, where he
sells many hundreds of newspapers
and magazines each day as a means
of earning his way through school.

Nor let it be supposed that selling
six or seven hundred newspapers a
day and carrying full time work at
the University take all the young
man's time. In addition, he is an ac-
complished violinist and leader of a
six-pleas orchestra, the “Northside
Radlo-Lites”; he teaches Sunday
school, writes regularly for a North-
slde newspa er, and receives ‘rejec-
tion sli rom magazine editors
with amazing regularity. ,

Rohleder is no novice at selling
papers, for since he was in the sixth
grade he was a newsboy. From earn-
ing a few cents a day he has ad-
vanced so far that for the tuition

fees required for his four years, he ~
sells 160,000 papers, or about 120 .;

truckloads.
No gay collegiate life as por-

trayed in_ the humor magazines, not '

for this ambitious young man. He

keeps himself to a strict schedule. f
In the morning and until 1:30 in the ‘-
afternoon he attends school. From '

then until 7 o’clock, he works at
his newsstand and delivers papers

over ;“r‘oute.” From '7 until-10,» '
he studiles in the Carnegie Library, 

213 Mendota L

Northside.

Later at his home,
street, he writes or studies until 1
o'clock in the morning. So to bed

and the ‘next morning the same.
thine: over again, varied, of course,‘

on the days his orchestra is play-

ing; for dances, at the theatres, in

(c1l_zurcl1es,“at plays, or at Polish wed-
m~s.

“I arrange my work,” he declared,
“in regular periods and concentrate
on it. If it were not for that -I
wouldn’t accomplish much. When my
mind ‘gets foggy from overwork, I
~uit and go to bed--or go out and
order coffee and doughnuts.” This is
Ro‘n.l~der’_s recipe for getting done.

Not until an individual poll of
campus organizations shall reveal
that the proposed standard activities
key is undesirable will the idea be
dropped, John R. Johnston, graduate
manager of student activities, inti-
mated. In the meantime, progress
on plans for the choosing of a suit-
able design for the key which, when
accepted, will be submitted to .or-
ganizationsfor approval, is _being
made.

Several leaders in campus activi-
ties have already expressed their dis-
favor of the idea which would sub-
stitute for the individual keys now
awarded by activities, one standard
key. The names of the activities
in which its wearer participated
would be engraved on the back of
each key. ._ .

At present the student activities
advisory fund purchases keys which
are awarded by the Pitt Panther, the
glee club, University band, Pitt
Players and the Weekly.

Student members of the advisory
committee include Harry ecker,

Bang’! Bang!

Muskets were stacked by quiet

wires ceased buzzing long enough
for executives of Pitt and Tech
military departments to leave
their humdrum duties and engage
in a battle, considered by experts
as one of the most gruelling in
the entire careers of these two
strategists '

There were over eighty con-
testants in the thick of the ﬁght-
ing. When the smoke of battle
cleared, Major Lloyd P. Horsfall ,
of the University military depart-
ment and First Lieutenant W. V.
Carter of Carnegie Tech’s mili-
tary department stood supreme.
Their dazzling bravery in ‘facing
huge odds coupled with a preco-
cious wit and intelligence, had
served them to vanquish all be-
fore their oifensive onslaught.

The occasion was the annual
bridge tournament j at the Pitts-
burgh Athletic Association, which
ended last Wednesday. Major
Horsfall and his aide held the
east and west positions, while
Lieutenant Carter and his part-
ner held the north and south
posts. Each won an engraved

gold pen and pencil set.

On Eve Of Meet

BARRED BY LOW GRADES

Wibecan McCullough,
Knobloch To Go

Pete Bowen and Russel Comfort,
crack Panther relay runners have
been declared ineligible because of
scholastic deﬁciency on the eve of
the Ohio State relays, therefore,
Coach Shea will be unable to send
a sprint relay team to the affair.
However, the Blue and Gold will be
represented by individual trackmen:
Captain Gibby Welch, in the discus
event; Vic Pickard, in the pole vault;
Don Gwinn, in the hammer throw;
Ed Knoblock, in the high hurdles,
and Ken Wibecan and Jim McCul-
lough, in the sprints.

Captain Gibby Welch will also en-
ter in the Triathlon Weight Cham-
pionship, in which an entrant must
compete in three of the four events:
discus, shot, javelin, and hammer.
He.will enter in the discus, shot and
javelin. According to the custom of
former years, each event will be
graded upon the basis of 1,000
points, 8,000 points being a perfect
record. Last year Welch placed sec-
ond with a score of 2,600 against

700, but this year a 2,600 score
a ould win the meet, as the distance
for the hammer throw, Gibby’s spec-
ialty, has been len hened to 160
feet, his consistent row.

 

 

 

 

Vic member of the Can-
adian 01 pics in 1924 who took
second e in the pole vault in

garis, will compete for the Gold and
his in the meet and should take
ﬁrst place. I_.ast year, Pickard_ took
ﬁi-st place with a vault of thirteen
feet with the temperature _near gem
and the wind blowing against him.

Another sure winner is Don Gwinii.
the smallest hammer throw man in
the country, and one of the few men
that take four turns in the ring. He
has placed in every_ big meet he
ever entered, and his best throw,
breaking a record, last year, was
foul, as he was forced out of the
ring, ‘s year Gwinn seems
stronger than ever.

All of these star athletes, Welch,
Picitard and Gwinn will be candi-
dates for the Olympic teams. Welch
and Gwinn will compete for Ameri-
ca, while Pxckard Will 30 With the

TRAINING STARTED

Carlson Will Drill Men In
Fundamentals For
Two Weeks

“Holding the ball is more than
nine-tenths of the game," instructed
Dr. H. Cliﬂord Carlson, coach of the
world-famed Carlson “steam-rollers,"
.aui-ing the course of events in the
first day‘: spring basketball prac-
tice, Monday. Dr. Carlson called this
‘paling session, which will continue
for two weeks. in order that he might
‘get a line on the prospects for a
championship team. He ‘desires to

lead the Panther squad through an.-
other successful camp!-Ian. bl?
whether this is possible or not s

expressed his wish to duplicate _the

quintet.

It is the coach's intention to con-
tinue spring drill for at least one
neck and possibly two, depending
upon the amount of fundamental tac-
ti s that the squad needs. “The
dill,” according to Simpson, assist-
ant varsity manager, “is not so much
to give the players practice, as it is
for Dr. Carlson to balance his
chances for the coming season and to
determine what type of work will be
but in order to mould another group
of ‘steam-rollers.’ " With the experi-
enced men who are out for the
squad, there is little doubt but that

TO DECIDE GREEK
TITLE BY TUESDAY

Delta Taus‘, Phi Kappas, Phi
Delta, Alpha Phi Delta
In Eliminations

 

 

After a hectic season that lasted
two and a half months the interim-
ternity basketball season is drawing
to a close. The championship of the
league will be decided within the
next week, and the ‘winning team
will be awarded a trophy. .

Four teams still remain in the
running, but three elimination games
will decide the winner. Two teams,
Delta Tau Delta and Alpha Phi
Delta. are ready for the ﬁnals, but
the Phi "Delta Theta and Phi~Kappa
have yet to meet for the champion-
ship of division three of the league.
The latter game will be played Tues-
day night, and will decide the third
entrant in the ﬁnals. It is certain
to be a thriller as both the Phi Delts
and Phi Kapps are anxious to win

the cup. The Phi Kapps beat Phi
Delta earlier in the season, and the
Phi Delta seek revenge.

The Phi Delts will probably start
their regular team, Brown and Un-
derwood at forwards, Dovergpike at
center. and Donchess and Willard at
guards. Donchess and Brown are two
of the best players in the league, both
are tall and are exceptionally good
shots. The Phi Kappa will probably
start cMahon and Mulvey at for-
wards, cm at center, and Mcstein
and Braddock at guards. Kern and
Mulvey have plenty of class on the
ﬂoor. The P Kapps might have
eliminated all the trouble 0 partici-
patina in the. playoffs had they dis-
covered the floor ability of Mulvey
earlier in the season.

The sexpi-ﬁnals and ﬁnals of the
lo 0 wil be played on Thursday
nig t and the olowin Tuesday.
Just who will play in ese games
cannot be decided until the leader-
ship of section three has been de-
cided. Delta Tau Delta and Alpha
Phi Delta are certain to play in one
of the two arms. A _

There wil be ‘three teem: articl-
pating in the ﬁnal games. T is sit-
uation will be taken care of as it
has been in the past years; one team
will draw a bye to the finals while
the other two teams will meet to de-
cide -the other ‘participant in the
finals. The ﬁnal game for the cham-
pionshlp will be played next Tuesday
evening at Trees ym.

Of the two teams already deﬁ-
nitely in the ﬁnal games Delta Tau
Delta has the most spectacular rec-
ord, having won every game it
ayed thiﬂ Year. Their lineup sounds
ke an all star aggregation—for-
wards, P. McClanahan and Porter,
J. _M<_:C1anahan at center, and Mont-

omery, Edwards or Tully at ards.
his will be a. tough team or any
agire ation to beat.

11) s Phi Delta has one defeat
agalinst it but that tame was lost
ear y in the season when the team
hpd not yet hit its stride. They have
soared more oints than any other
team in the eague and have three
stars that stand out especially
Stptz, forward, Celio, center, an
Paomore, guard. Fenow and Arture,
the other two regulars of the team
always contribute their share of
points and play a clean aggressive
game.

The winner of the league cham-
pionship will probably receive a sil-
ver loving cup as the champions of
the past, but no definite announce-
ments have been made by the com-
mittee.

Harry Feinstein is the newly
appointed chairman of the league.

C-ub Net Candidates

All candidates for the fresh-
man tennis team are requested to
report at the Stadium this after-
noonoat 3:80 o'clock, ready for
practice. Apprentice managers
should report at the same time.

l

Carlson's hope will be realized.

The varsity tennis team will open
its 1928 season Saturday against
Wash-Jeff. Somewhat handicapped
by lack of practice due to the in-
clement weather of late, the team
has not yet had any real practice
sessions, although the men have
peen playing individually for some

ime.

Last week the men reported for
practice, but Coach Stephens was
absent and so little or nothing was
done. At present Coach Stephens is
outof town,vand practice has been
again postponed. It is probable that
the Pitt net men will go into their
ﬁrst match with little or no prac-
tice under their coach's eye.

Nevertheless the Pitt team will
enter the match as favorite. It is not
probable that the Presidents w 1
have strength enough in their ran
to turn back the stars that will up-
hold the Pitt standards. Even though
Captain John 0’LaughiiIi has not yet
made his appearance on the courts,
it is probable that he will be out
later in the week and will play Sat-
urday. His brother Dave has not re-
ported and it is yet doubtful whether
he will come out later or not. Baur,
Cable, Lauler, Baker and Blumberg
are enthused about the opening
match, and have been practicing the

ast few weeks on the indoor court.
t is probable that these men will
take part in Saturday’s match.

The match Saturday and the next
few home matches for the Panther
team will be played on the courts in
the stadium as there are no other
courts available in the city.

Last year Pitt's vars ty tennis
team had only a mediocre season.
The reason for their showing was
that they had little training and

Panther Captain Cops Three
First Places In Pitt

-—p—q——_.

Capt. Bill Wright won three first
places and smashed his own mark in
the 40-yard, free-style to lead the
way in the Pitt championships con-
ducted at Trees pool last Friday and
Saturda . He won the fancy dive,
100-yar free-style and 40-yard free-
style, covering the latter distance in
18 4-5 seconds. Irvin Valentine
broke the mark for e 440-yard
free-style event of 6:08 and hung up

The Peabody High School swim-
ming team iinished victorious in the
fourteenth annual Pitt inter-scholas-
tics. The East Liberty mermen won
in a masterly fashion piling up a
total of 19 points. Perry won second
honors with a total of 2 points and
Homestead ﬁnished third with 10.
Other schools scored as follows:
Schenley 9, South 8, Carrick 6, Al-
legheny 8, Duquesne 3, Westing-
house 1, South Hills 1.

One senior high school record was
broken and one junior mark was
changed durin the rogress of the
meet. John chmei er of Garrick
set the new high school mark when
he won the 100-yard breast stroke
in 1:13, the former mark being
1:13 4-5 set in 1924 by T. Mat-
thews of the Pittsburgh Academy.
The junior mark for the 120-yard
medley was lowered by South's na-
tators by doing that event in the
fast time of 1:26.

The last noise on the cam us con-
cerning swimming that will e made
this year will be the annual banquet
to be held Tuesday evening, April
23, in the Faculty club. Preparations
are all made for this “yearly feed”
and Coach Corr has several sur-
prises lined up for his tankers.

dently the team did not proﬁt by the
experience. They are fortunate that
they meet W. & J. in their first two
matches and not some of their
stronger opponents such as Ohio
State and Notre Dame, whom they
will meet here in several weeks. The
W. & J. team was decidedly weak
last year; they were twice defeated
by the Panther’s, 7 to 0. It is not
probable that the Presidents will
fare much better this year.

PITT DEBATING TEAM
ADMIRED BY EAST

a Audiences Hear Squad
__ in Two, Lose Three To
Eastern Schools

Unusual interest was shown by
eastern audiences at debates in
which ' Pitt's affirmative team en-

in its recent trip, states

' ard Murphy, graduate assistant
in English, who accompanied the
team.

According to Mr. Mu hy the trip
was very satisfactory. “ he interest
shown by the audiences vie met was
most tifying. In every city we
visi T on the trip there were large
audiences in attendance. The aver-

fattendance at debates on the
tri was about 250 to 300, and at
at

Cross, where admission was

arged-there were about 750 people
inisttendance. Everyone was sym-
pathetic with the boys and held
them’ in high esteem. It is worthy
of rnotethat in eastern colleges de-
bating stands high. in the list of ac-
tivities and the debating associa-
tions andaclubs which are sponsored
byfthe college maintain club rooms
and houses.” said Mr. Murphy.

’ The'.ea‘stern team was composed
of.-C; J. -Phillips, ’30; A. S. Levin,
,'29*,_a.nd».R.»F. Young, ’28, all of the
college. ~ The team’s record was two
debates won and three lost.

“Take a bus!”

And the glee club, not content
with trying to go by bus to

- Johnstown’, must go to Eric and
environs again by bus.

It had no snow or anemic

time-—engine trouble was enough.
Soniewliei‘e.near Erie the ‘bus
broke adrive-shaft and its oc-
cupants had to be transferred to

made, a drvie-sliaft over night
and the bus proceeded.

Outside of Warren the same
bus developed a knock in the
motor- It took just five hours to
fix it. While the boys hunted up
a movie‘ and amused themselves
by shouting at a Wild West pic-

Pittsburgh at 1 O'clock Saturday
morning. And the Pan-Hellenic
