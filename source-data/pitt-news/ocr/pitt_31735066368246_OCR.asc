Grant Awarded

A 351.8 million U.S. Depart-
ment of Education grant has

'7 been awarded to Dr. Phillip

Strain of Pitt's Western Psychi-
atric Institute and Clinic to
develop an Early Childhood
Research Institute.

The purpose of the grant, one
of only three in the country, is
to develop a program aimed at
improving the social, learning
and adaptive skills of severely
handicapped children under
the age of five.

For its first two years, the
institute will focus on develop-
ing methods that will change
the severely handicapped child-
ren’s behavior in the areas of
~ disruptive behaviors, language
development, social interaction
skills, independent work and
play and parent training.

The methods developed dur-
ing the first two years will be
tested during the remaining
three years. Children who
receive training in all five areas
will be compared to other

severely handicapped children
who did not

Students Upset With Reform Progress

By LYNNE LACEY

Student members of the Curricu-
lum Reforms Implementation
Committee are complaining that
the curriculum reforms involving
foreign language and writing
requirements are not being imple-
mented properly, with easier intro-
ductory language courses being
substituted for present entry level
ones and with not enough of the

new “W” writing courses being
offered.

However, College of Arts and
Sciences dean Irwin Schulman and
other committee members believe
that this judgment has been made
prematurely. But Schulman
acknowledged that hes been send-
ing memos and will visit individ-
ual department heads to prod them
into moving more quickly on the
implementation.

Linda O'Connor, who was the

student spokesman for curriculum
reform last year and is now the Stu-
dent Government Board coordina-
tor of the six implementation
committees, said that during talks
the foreign language and foreign
culture committee has mentioned
the possibility of instituting intro-
ductory language courses which
will be easier and eliminate the
present quality of education. ‘

“The whole intent of the curric-

_ulum reforms with a language

requirement was to make students
learn something, the discipline of a
foreign language,” she said. “Is it a
reform if a student can go through
two years of the language and still
not read or write it?”

O’Connor also said that so far
only six “W” courses have been
accepted for next year’s\fall term.
Eight were submitted.

“W” courses are to be offered in
all CAS departments with a writ-

Pitt Incident Mirrors Iraq Situation

By RAY WUSLICH

This weekend's clash between
two different factions of Iraqi stu-
dents on campus is “clear evi-
dence” that the Al-Dowah
movement in Iraq — previously
thought to be dead —— is still surviv-
ing, Pitt political science professor
and Mid-East expert Richard Cot-
tam said yesterday.

The aim of the Al-Dowah move-
ment in Iraq is to overthrow the
Iraqi government and establish an
Islamic. republic — a regime sim-
ilar to the one in Iran that looks to
the Ayatollah Khomeini,” Cottam
said. “The movement was active in
carrying out guerilla wars, and
there was evidence that it was
defeated and dead.

“However, the evidence that it
isn't dead is here on campus.”

Two persons were injured and
two arrested Saturday when the
Islamic Union of Iraqi students
attempted to hold a meeting in the
Forbes Quadrangle to discuss
alleged atrocities committed
against Muslims by Iraqi president
Saddam Hussein. The Islamic
Union is pro-Ayatollah Khomeini,
Iran's leader.

About 50 members of a pro-
Hussein group, armed with knives
and clubs, blocked the doors to the
meeting and began battling with
the Islamic Union members. City
and campus police were called to
break up the fight.

International student adviser
Ralph Morrison, who witnessed
the incident, said to his knowledge,

Pitt students were not involved in
the pro—Hussein group. He said he
didn't know where the members of
that groupwere from but will be
“looking into the matter” this
week.

Hushan Husainy, a representa-
tive of the Islamic Union, told The
Pittsburgh Press that the pro-
Hussein group consisted of stu-

dents flown to Pittsburgh to break
up the meeting. He called the
group members “secret police” of
the Hussein regime.

According to Cottam, Husainy’s
claim may be credible.

. “The claim that the Iraqi
government sent them (members of
the pro—Hussein group) here is a
reasonably credible claim that fits a

pattern I have seen in the past,”

Cottam said. “I saw similar events .

happen around the time before the
Shah of Iran fell.”

He said the government prob-
ably flew the students in because
the students most likely wouldn’t
have the airfare, and wouldn't be
aware of the event.

By CHRISTINA CLINTON

Last week, the National Confer-
ence of Catholic Bishops held its
annual convention in Washington,
D.C. One of the most publicized
issues of that conference was
nuclear weapons and the possibility
of a nuclear war.

A wide variety of groups from
around the nation are taking a stance
against the build-up of nuclear wea-
pons. One of these groups com-
prises the professors and faculty
members of many colleges and
universities.

On Nov. 11, educational events
were held at over 500 colleges,
including Pitt, to infonn the public
about the threat of nuclear war.
Although there was an interest on the
part of Pitt's faculty, many students
showed no interest at all.

Liane Norman, an English profes-

sor and member of the Arms Race

Nationwide Campus Nuclear
Forums FailTo Attract Students

Study Group, said Pitt's convocation
was not very successful. Most of the
workshops that were held were
poorly attended, and the coverage by
the l7ittsburgh papers and television
stations was minimal or nonexistent.

The tables set up in Forbes Quad-

rangle, however, were well attended
and considered a great success, Nor-
man said.
, She said she was not sure why the
attendance at most of the events was-
so low, but would have to blame it on
a general apathy, or, more approp-
n'ately, "psychic numbing."

“Some students just can’t tolerate
this issue," Norman said. "They're
more worried about their career
goals or their relationships."

Some people, she said, are so
scared or feel so powerless that they
don't want to even hear about the
issue. let alone get involved with it

The sponsors of this year's convo-

had last year, which may have been
another reason that the convocation
was not as successful as it might
have been.

Most _of the-_\A_/or_kshops and lec-
tures were to inform and educate,
Norman said, and perhaps there
should have been some solutions
suggested instead of just talk.

Bob Nonnan, of the public and
international aﬁairs department, said
a lack of administrative and student
leader involvement could also have
been a reason for the low
attendance.

For example, Chancellor Wesley
Posvar was unable to attend any of
the events because he was out of
town. The Student Government
Board was not involved at all.

The planning for Pitt's convoca-
tion began during the ﬁrst week of

‘Students Upset With Implementation Progress

ing requirement of 20 to 24 pages of
written material, including some
form of revision. The main goal of
a “W" course is to provide a course
outside of the English department,
and of student interest, which
improves writing ability while cov-
ering subjects in another field of
study.

“Everyone seems to agree with
the intent of the reform, but we’re
having trouble getting this thing

-¢‘,=.;.ff the ground. Faculty response

l&

was overwhelming during the
planning stages, but now they

don’t seem willing to make an -

effort," O’Connor said.
According to Natalie Tull, one
of two student members of the writ-
ing implementation committee, all
proposals for “W” courses are to be

submitted no later than Dec. l.The-

committee had hoped to imple-
ment this program by next fall, but
because .of apathetic faculty
response, this doesn’t seem likely.

7Basically, the English depart-
ment is responding, which is
exactly what we don't want. We
want other departments with fields

of interest other than writing,"
Tull said. “The majority of the
departments haven't submitted
anything."

As Dean Schulman understands
the situation, the foreign language
and foreign culture committee is
considering a general introductory
language course for the small
group of students who are educa-
tionally disadvantaged or have no
high school language experience.
Such a course would give students
a vocabulary for discussing lan-
guage by helping them master such
concepts as the parts of speech,
Schulman said.

“This is not a watering down of

the requirement. It's comparable to -

offering introductory algebra and
trig classes. Students still must
complete the upper level courses,"
he said.

Concerning the difficulties of
implementing the writing require-
ment, Schulman said, “If it were
easy, I would be suspicious."

Schulman said that only 20 “W"
courses need be offered next year,
based on College Writing Board
figures.

Let’s clean house!

  Pittsburgh is our home.

To raise the total from the cur-
rent six, Schulman sent a memo-
randum to all faculty members last
week, encouraging them to submit
course descriptions and require-
ments to the implementation com-
mittee for review. His next move is

to visit individual departments.
“I have no means of compelling
them to fulfill this commitment.
All I have is my powers of persua-
sion," he said.
Beverly Harris—Schenz, chair-
man of the foreign language and

sions have been reached.

the events, he said, were held in the
Student Union building and were
accessible to a large majority of
people.

A reason for the success, Hawk
said, was because the programs and
seminars were not onesided. Differ-
ent points of view were presented on
all facets of the nuclear arms
question. .

Suneel Ratan, the political editor of
The Daily Bmin, the student paper at
the University of California at Los
Angeles, said their convocation was
not successful at all.

Called a "Nuclear War Teach-ln,”
Ratan said that only 100 students

showed up at the events sponsored
by the Concerned Faculty at UCLA,
as compared to the 2,50(}3,00_O who
participated last year.

He said the main reason for low
attendance was because there were
no “big names" at the event Last
year, the teach-in had then-California
governor Jeny Brown.

All the people interviewedyagreed
that most students in college cannot
fathom the possibility of nuclear war
because they are more concerned
with their futures in the job market.
That, they agreed, was a major factor
in the lack of interest shown toward
the convocations.

Assessing

Teachers

Choosing courses and professors at Pitt is a lot like
flipping'coins—it’s an expensive gamble.

Often, students must rely on word-of-mouth to
find classes and instructors that suit their needs.
Unfortunately, these personal (and often nar_row)
opinions are seldom reliable. To address these prob-
lems, the Student Government Board (SGB) is con-
tinuing to push for increased student evaluations of
teaching. The SGB wants each professor to be
required to have one course evaluated per term. This
is a feasible and admirable goal, provided that it's
done in the right way.

Currently, teaching evaluations are optional, and
some professors choose never to be evaluated.
Instructors who voluntarily undergo evaluation
may grant permission for the results of their surveys
to be published in The Review of'Course Evalua-
tions. This book, published by the Academic Affairs
Committee, sits neglected and dusty on the shelves at
Hillman Library.

The questionnaires presently used for College of
Arts and Sciences courses consist of 24 questions,
half of which were formulated several years ago by
SGB. The Review of Course Evaluations publishes
responses to only the student—posed questions. The
questions left out were formulated by professionals
in the Office for the Evaluation of Teaching, includ-
ing some of the leading figures in the field of teach-
ing evaluation. If meaningful results are to be
published, then responses to all of the questions
must appear.

Further, the published questions should focus
more closely on the structure of courses and less on
students’ personal reactions to instructors. This
information would be more relevant to students
making course selection decisions.

A large number of professors currently use Pitt's
evaluation system, but making evaluation manda-
tory is necessary to ensure that this record is main-
tained and improved.

Merely requiring evaluations will not cure Pitt's
teaching problems, however. Evaluations must be
one part of a system designed to encourage all faculty
to strive to improve their teaching effectiveness. Spe-
cial care must be taken to ensure that the publication
or other use of evaluation results does not stifle
innovations in teaching. Some teachers might be
reluctant to experiment with new teaching methods
if they expect a flood of unfavorable evaluations to
be published.

If this institution is concerned—as it claims to
be—with the quality of teaching, then no instructor
should be permitted to teach without receiving regu-
lar feedback from both peers and students concern-
ing his teaching effectiveness.

Socrates Bids Farewell

By RON BARBER

Going to work on Saturday
mornings is bad enough. Driving
the Parkway to the airport with my
head itching from a quick shave is
no fun, believe me. But this Satur-
day it rained. And it rained hard!
So I parked as close to the terminal
as Icould and, with my box of cards
and flower-pins, I prepared to
make a dash for it. Bu.t in my haste,

my toga ‘caught in the car door.-

Rats! I had to stand there, cold
raindrops pelting my bare scalp,
and fumble to get the door open
and free my toga.

In the terminal at last, I made for
my assigned area, only to see
another guy in a toga working my
turf‘. At first, I thought this must
have been one of those turkeys from
a rival splinter group trying to hus-
tle in on my prime territory.
Believe me, I was in no mood for
this. I stormed up to him and de-
manded, “Who are you?"

“Why, my name is Socrates."

“What makes you think you can

work my turf, Socrates?"

“I'm afraid you've got the wrong
man. I'm not working, I'm just
Socrates.”
“What’s
mean?”
“What? Haven't you heard of the
oracle at Delphi, The Republic,

that supposed to

 

hemlock tea?"

“Oh yeah," I muttered, “I
remember vaguely. But what are
you doing here?.I thought you were
dead or something.”

“I'm catching a plane out of here
as fast as I can.”

“Whatsa matter? Don't like the
weather?”

“Well, I came here to do some
research for a friend . . . 

“Oh, a scientist, eh?"

“Yes, indeed. My friend, Juan
Coriolis is trying to prove than,
because of the Earth’s rotation, if
you go anywhere in the northern
hemisphere and try to walk a
straight line with your eyes closed,
you'll end up in Pittsburgh.”

you're leaving?"

. “Well, I was going to stay and
watch a few football games—a
most curious pastime—but there's
this kid named Steve who's been
following me around and writing
about everything I do.”

“So, what's wrong with a little
publicity?”

“It's not that. This guy mis-
quotes me all the time. I don't
think he’s even read any of my
books. It's really most aggravating.

. Oh, well, I’ve got to catch a plane.

It's been nice talking.”

As he turned to go, I reached to
pin a flower on his toga. “It’s on
the house,” I said. "

Why Don’t We Care?

By scorr REX

Somebody do me a favor and put
a clamp over President Reagan's
mouth. He's starting to sound like
a broken record. “Foreign agents”
have infiltrated the U.S. peace
movement. Cut me a break. His
evidence: the October Reader’s
Digest article, “The KGB's Magi-
cal War for Peace." Maybe in addi-
tion to Reader’s Digest, Ronnie
should read Mother Jones, it might
help him to balance his mind back
to a sane position. Who is he to say
that people against the idea of
nuclear weapons have good inten-
tions but are nevertheless misled.
With the Catholic bishops joining
the call for a nuclear freeze, Reagan
has his hands full. If communist
agents have infiltrated and influ-
enced the bishops, I belong to the
wrong faith.

With a man like Reagan in the
White House, why are students
wasting time arguing about the
benefits of a liberal arts education?
And why do the same bylines con-
tinue to grace these pages? Are
there only ten students who care
enough to voice their opinions? If
this is the case, it shows us that
there is an intellectual crisis at this
university.

I have been told that The Pitt
News is not The New York Times,
and because of this, there is no
room for editorials concerning for-
eign policy molded by student sub-
jectivity. Why not? What makes the

editorial writers of The New York
Times so qualified? I think that, if
we wanted to, we could do a better
job. We have far more experts on
any given subject than the Times.
It seems that people, higher than
the editor in The Pitt News hierar-
chy are afraid to rock the boat. I'm
no radical, but I believe in being
patriotic.

By patriotic, I mean one who
loves his country so much that he
wants to see improvements. Con-
servatives and liberals who don't
question the motives of their
governments are as guilty of wear-
ing ideological blinders as a Com-
munist Party member. Whatever
happened to the creativity of the
American student? It wouldn't sur-
prise me if today's student had
never heard of The Students for a
Democratic Society. SDS, what was
that? Hippies who gave out free
drugs? Long before 1965, the kids
from SDS were working in the
ghettos of America. Unlike today's
student generation, they believed
in the ideals of American
democracy.

It’s quite apparent to me that
Pitt students care about little.
Nuclear war, they think will never
occur. To these students, I will
only ask: When is the last time man
invented a military weapon——
including nuclear—that he did not
use against his fellow man? Albert
Einstein once said that arms con-
trol is a waste, either you have total

disarmament or you head toward
war. We are notbeing led towards
total disarmament. President Car-
ter once mentioned the possibility
of lowering the stockpile to 200
weapons—the number required for
minimum deterrence. The Joint

. Chiefs of Staff must have thought it

a ridiculous notion.

Tonight, if President Reagan
mentionsforeign agents in the U.S.
peace movement, do yourself a
favor and read the Reader’s Digest
article. You may find out his facts
are based on a foundation of
quicksand.

Looking for
big-time crime

Hey, all you criminals out
there. You want to get into big-
time crime? Here’s how.

No, don’t assault a cub scout
or beat an old lady and steal her
money. That’s not bad enough,
at least according to the Reagan
administration. You would go
to jail for a short time and then
be paroled. Granted, the Rea-
gan administration has been
much harsher than past admin-
istrations on such offenders, but
there is only one thing short of
murder that really stirs their
dander.

Criminals committing this
grotesque offense face a possi-
ble five years in prison and a
$10,000 fine. You can commit

  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
 

this unmentionable act simply  ~ _.

by doing nothing.

All you have to do is fail t i

register with the Selective Serv-
ice System for the standby mil-
itary draft. That’s right—just
refuse to dedicate your life to
any police action or war the
United States might decide to
enter.

If you want to get into even
more trouble, stand up strongly
for your pacifist convictions
and urge others to do the same.
Because the Reagan adminis-
tration holds a special disdain
for people with moral convic-
tions differing from their own.

Ask Benjamin Sasway, a pol-
itical science major in San
Diego, who was sentenced on
Oct. 4 to two and one-half years
in a federal minimum-security
prison. Before his sentencing,
Sasway gave a 20-minute speech
explaining his opposition to
draft registration, which, he
said, “deprives young men of
one of the most important
moral decisions they can
make--to take another life.”

Anyone following the dic-
tates of his conscience, hurting
absolutely no one, supported by
1,000 letters written to thejudge
urging leniency and supported
by another 1,100 people on a
petition currently deserves two
and one-half years in prison.

Or ask 21-year-old David
Wayte of Pasadena, who is in
the midst of his trial. Last week
a federal judge decided testi-
mony from presidential counse-
lor Edwin Meese III is needed to
nail this vicious criminal.

The Reagan administration
has decided to make examples
out of Wayte and 12 other social
deviants. And catch this:
Wayte's lawyers have had the

4

    
 

audacity to claim that Wayte’s
constitutional right of freedom
of speech is violated by the
government's selective prosecu-
tion of outspoken opponents of
the draft.

Where did Wayte dig up these
communist attorney’s?

We're right with you, regis-
tration enforcers. America:
Love it or leave it. '

The Daily Collegian
Penn State
Friday Nov. 5, 1982

Trying to choose courses and
professors at this university us
like playing Russian roulette.
As it stands now, students have
to rely almost exclusively on
hearsay for information regard-
ing courses and instructors.
Last spring, information from
teacher evaluations was
released for only 12 percent of
the courses taught.

To rectify that problem, a
move has been under way on
campus to increase the use of
course-instructor surveys to
make survey results available to
students.

Monday, the Faculty Senate
heard a report from a committee
of teach evaluations. In effect,
the committee's report seeks to
preserve the status quo.

The committee proposes that
no mandatory evaluations be
established “without the
express approval of the faculty
concerned.” Although the
report states faculty members
should be encouraged to parti-
cipate in course-instructor sur-
veys, it does nothing to increase
the chances that they will
participate.

Worse, the report advocates
that evaluations include a space
for students to sign their names
and that students “be informed
that the seriousness with which
their evaluations are taken will
depend on whether or not they

do so.” Any statistician worth
his or her salt will tell you that
compelling respondents to sign

 

On TeocherEvo|uoiions
We all deserve better

a survey will grossly bias the
results. The committee argues
that students needn’t fear repri-
sal for their comments since
instructors don’t see survey

35%

results until after grades have
been submitted, but what if a
student has to take an instructor
twice or wants to take a course
from the instructor’s best drink-
ing pal? 0

Faculty members want to
have their cake and eat it too.

  

They want evaluations, on a
voluntary basis, as long as only
they are privy to the results.
With the exception of the busi-
ness, law and architecture facul-
ties (who have instituted
mandatory evaluations within
their schools), professors aren’t
willing to risk the consequences
of mandating evaluations and
making the results public.
Assisting students seems to be
their lowest priority.

Discussion over evaluations
has always centered around the
problems with evaluations as
they are currently administered.
Faculty members fear statistics
will be misused by administra-
tors who make promotion deci-
sions. But instead of trying to
come up with solutions, faculty
members for the most part talk
only of the current system's
imperfections.

By refusing to help establish
a fair system of evaluation, the
faculty leaves students with no
option but to rely on such oft-
disparaged surveys as U Tmost’s
best and worst faculty poll. We
think students, and faculty,
deserve better.

Cotton Aside, Pitt Eyes Lions

By BRIAN BALK

Pitt coach Foge Fazio answered
with a jubilant “We’ll be there"
after J. L. Hoffines Jr., presidentof
the Cotton Bowl Committee,
extended a warm southern invita-
tion to play on New Year’s Day.
Chancellor Wesley Posvar and
Fazio were then fitted with ten gal-
lon cowboy hats and the entire
lockerroom exploded in celebra-
tion.

The Cotton Bowl is one of the
most prestigious and profitable of
all bowl games. In addition to its
wealth and honor, it will give the
Panthers a second shot to redeem
their hopes for a national title as
they face second ranked Southern
Methodist.

After the rapturous mood died
down, the Panthers returned to

Swimmers

Way MELODY BISH

In a weekend meet with nation-
ally ranked Michigan, the Pitt
Lady Panther swim team lost, 102-
47. Coach David Belowich said he
felt that the score was not indica-
tive of how well his young team
performed.

Belowich was, however, some-
what displeased with Michigan's
tactics. He believed Michigan ran
up the score.

“They (Michigan) could have

’.done exhibition swimming where

the total points would not be run
up," he said.

Despite the loss, there were three
Lady Panthers who were double
winners. Sue Heon won the 100-
yard freestyle in 10:20 and the 500-

yard freestyle in 5:04:48. Pitt’sl

reality. .It was apparent that the
members of this 9-1 squad were
concerned with only one thing. It
was not containing the power of
the SMU “Pony Express” of tail-
backs Eric Dickerson and Craig
James nor was it how the other
bowl invitations would affect their
ranking in the polls. The major
concern of the players was beating
Penn State Friday.

“As soon as we made the com-
mitment to go to the Collon Bowl,
we started thinking about Penn
State,” flanker Dwight Collins
said.

Without a win at Penn State, the
Cotton Bowl—win or lose—will
mean relatively little. Most of the
players shared this attitude.

“For myself, Penn State in itself
is the whole season,” explained
cornerback Tim Lewis. “Penn

State is the national championship
as far as I’m concerned."

Last year's 48-14 loss to the Nit-
tany Lions still haunts the Panth-
ers. Quarterback Dan Marino has a
practice jersey emblazoned with
this score in his locker for
inspiration.

Revenge.

“We definitely owe them for last
year," senior linebacker Yogi Jones
said. “We’re going to work a little
harder so we can make sure that it
doesn't happen again.”

Jimbo Covert sees the necessity
of vengence, but he also realizes it
has limits.

“Revenge-type attitude can only
carry you so far, it then comes
down to ability," Covert
explained. He cited this year’s Flor-
ida State game asan example of

vich. Ujevich won the 100-yard
individual medley in 1:00:47 and
the 100-yard freestyle in 53:50.

Pitt's final double winner was
Alicia Dugan. Dugan had been out
of Pitt’s matches with Syracuse and
Tennessee with a broken ear drum,
and her two victories were a big
boost for the Lady Panthers.

She took first place in the 50-yard
freestyle in 24:81.

Belowich was especially pleased
with the performance of the mile
freestyle relay team, composed of
freshmen Denise Ricketts and
Dugan and juniors Denise Sed-
lacek and Diane Firth. They won
the event with a time of 3:40:12.

"I’m real pleased with the indi-
vidual wins and I see tremendous
improvement in the squad from
last weekend," Belowich said.

He also stated that when one

considers the level of competition
the team has been up against and
the youngness of the team, they’ve
done real well.

“The team is better than the
scores and the record indicates," he
said.

He believes that the team will
have better times later in the sea-
son. Right now, Belowich says that
he's just looking for improvement
in racing strategies. It is his belief
that if the girls get their strategies
down, the results will be seen later
in the season. According to the
second-year coach, there i-s already
appreciable improvement in the
squad in just their first three meets.

If this type of improvement con-
tinues, the Lady Panther swim

team should have a fine season.

Pitt Offense Keeps

Rutgers Off Balance

By Scott DELLETT

Finally, the pieces’ came
together. The Pitt football team,
the one with the mighty defense
and the inconsistent offense,
silenced the critics Saturday by eas-
ily handling Rutgers, 52-6, before
approximately 35,000 who braved
the rainy conditions at Pitt
Stadium. -

The performance came at an
opportune time as, after the game,
the Cotton Bowl Committee for-
mally invited Pitt to Dallas for
New Year's Day. The Panthers will
face Southern Methodist, the
Southwest Conference champion.
The Mustangs clinched the Cotton
Bowl bid by tying Arkansas Satur-
day, 17-17.

From the first time Pitt got the
ball, there was something different.
Using a no huddle offense and a
variety of play-action passes, the
Panthers built up a 21-0 lead in the
first quarter.

“There were a number of things
we wanted to do, one of which was
to keep them off balance right off
the bat," head coach Foge Fazio
said. “That’s why we used the no
huddle offense and play-action
passes.”

“We did some things differently
to keep Rutgers off balance today,"
quarterback Dan Marino said. “We

 

 

Bryan Toas .4.4)"andfthe entire Pltt team are loking

put in some new wrinkles instead
of the same basic plays we run.”

Marino, who has taken the
majority of the criticism about the
lack of continuity in the offense,
had one of his better games of the
season, completing 22 of 30 passes
for 262 yards and three touch-
downs. Most importantly, he
didn’t throw an interception.

“Considering the conditions, I
thought Dan Marino played a great
game,” Fazio said.

The Panthers had good field
position throughout the game. In
fact, Rutgers’ offense never got
inside the Pitt 30-yard line as its
offense was supplied by the small-
est member of the team. Kicker
Alex Falcinelli, a 5-7, 150 lb.
sophomore, kicked two 51-yard
field goals, one with seven seconds
in the first half and the second on
the final play of the game.

“We knew coming into the game
we wouldn’t be able to run the ball,
so we hoped to play well enough to
maintain field position and get
some breaks along the way,”
Rutgers coach Frank Burns said.
“But Pitt started on our 49, and
that set the tone for the ball game.”

As usual, the defense came up
with another stellar performance.
Interceptions by linebacker Yogi
Jones, Rich Kraynak and corner-
back Troy Hill set up three Panther

An All-Around

By JIM O'BRIEN

Carl Rees re-wound the film reel
in a dimly-lit room at Pitt’s Trees
Hall physical education complex
atop Cardiac Hill. He wanted to
watch, just once more, the film of
Arnie Sowell finishing fourth in
the 800 meter run at the Olympic
Games in Melbourne, Australia in
November of 1956.

It’s a result that still causes Rees,
who was the assistant to Carl Olson
with Pitt’s track and field team at
the time, and anyone who closely
followed Sowell’s collegiate career,
to shake his head in disbelief.

“Arnie Sowell was one of the
greatest runners who ever lived,"
remarked Rees, who later became
the head coach of the sport at Pitt,
and remains a physical education
instructor there today. “He had
such great range. He could run
from a quarter to five miles,
Nobody did it all as well."

When needed, Sowell could also
be called upon to compete in the
high jump or long jump, if it
meant more points to the Pitt total
in a dual meet..He anchored all the
key relay teams for the panthers.

At nearby Schenley High
School, Sowell had been a hurdler
and high jumper on the track team,
and an outstanding swimmer.

He turned to track, in the first
place, because he couldn't beat one
of his buddies in swimming at
Schenley, and once he switched
sports he excelled. He was a natu-
ral. Once he realized just how good
he was he dreamed of running in
the Olympic Games.

Sowell was regarded as one of the
greatest middle-distance runners in
the world. Going into the Olympic
Games, he was co-holder of the
world’s 1000-yard run_ record at
2208.8 minutes, had been the lC4A
half-mile champion the past three
years, and the CAA and National
AAU half-mile king the previous
two seasons.

His main competition was Tom
Courtney of Livingston, N.J., who
ran for Fordham. Sowell had
beaten Courtney many times, but
mostly indoors. Courtney had his
number outdoors, however, and
beat him in the Olympic Trials. So
Sowell was seeded second behind
Courtney in the handicapping for

, A The Pitt News, Monday November 22, I982

Track Star Who Specialized In Middle— Distance Running

the 800 meter run at the Olympics.

In “Chariots of Fire,” the inspi-
rational English movie about two
Olympic athletes—that won the
Academy Award as the “best
movie” for 1981, nothing goes
wrong! Nobody gets injured or kid-
napped or broken-hearted before
the big games.

Sowell shared the ambitions of
the real-life athletes depicted in
that movie, Eric Liddell and
Harold Abrahams, who “ran with
hope in their hearts, and wings on
their heels.” Said Sowell: “The
Olympics are all you hope for...and
more.”

But everything went wrong for
Sowell. After he qualified for the
Olympics, Sowell took several
weeks off from his training. He
took a job at a recreation center in

The Hill, and sprained an ankle
playing basketball with the
youngsters.

“He wasn’t able to train and con-
dition himself properly prior to the
Games,” recalls Rees.

“Then it turned up a cold and
rainy day in Melbourne, and they
were running on a crushed-brick
track. A light guy like Arnie—he
only weighed about 135 pounds,
and he was 5-ll—was at a disad-
vantage on a wet heavy track like
that. It’s the same way in a horse
race, I’m told."

Sowell set the pace until the
stretch run, but he finished fourth.
“A blanket could have covered all
four men at the finish line,” wrote
Les Biederman of The Press. “But
Sowell was fourth. It was a heart-
breaking effort for the 21-year-old
Pitt star.”

Upon his return to Pittsburgh,
Sowell said, “I ran the race I
planned just the way I figured it
out. I wanted to set the pace and I
did. I felt when the time came in the
stretch to call on something extra,
I’d be ready.

“But this time, when I called on
my reserve, it just wasn’t there. I
have no regrets. I ran the best I
knew how and it simply wasn’t
good enough.

“Many people now are critical of
me for setting the pace but they
weren’t critical of me when I was
winning back here. I’d rather lose a
race in exceptional time than win a
slow one. If we ran this race again
tomorrow, I’d run it the same
way.”

Courtney caught Sowell in the
stretch and proved stronger at the
finish. Courtney captured the gold
medal.

-Following the Olympics, Sowell
beat Courtney at least eight
straight times on indoor tracks,
including a record-breaking effort
at 880 yards in the Millrose Games
at Madison Square Garden in Feb-
ruary of 1957. But Sowell lost all
fine races they outdoors the pre-

vious year, including the biggest
race of them all at Melbourne.

“I had to admire him for what he
did,” says Courtney now. “It was a
mistake to run the way he did, but
he decided to go for it. He could
have finished second, I’m sure, but
he wanted to win. He made a val-
iant attempt. I think it was worth
the try.”

Courtney resides in Sewickley
these days, and commutes to his
downtown Pittsburgh office where
he’s an investment counselor for
Federated Investors, a money
market fund.

Courtney recalls the race:

“I took the lead intially, then
Sowell took over. He led most of
the way. I had planned on sprint-
ing the last 80 meters. With 140
meters to go, Sowell took off in a
sprint.

“I knew that, at the pace we had
been going at, there was no way he
could sustain that pace. Then I
thought, ‘My gosh, here we are in
the Olympics. I wonder if he could
go all the way.’ So I chased him.
After I went by him, he was tying
up (muscles pulling). He had run
his sprint, and I had run my sprint,
and I was tying up, too. Then
Derek Johnson, from England,

. came up on the inside and went by
us both.

“Somehow, someway I was able
to reaccelerate, though I was totally
spent. I was able to catch Johnson
and stagger across the finish line. I
mis-ran the race, but I couldn’t take
the chance of letting Sowell go.
Sowell was the man I had to beat;
he was my competition.”

Johnson finished second, with
Auden Boyson of Norway third.

“It was a terrible track that day; it
was so soft," recalled Courtney.
“There’s no question it had a more
adverse affect on Arnie. He was 5-
1 1, 135. I was 6-2, 185. He was better
on the boards indoors because he
was such a light runner, in weight
and the way he hit the track. He
had an effortless type of running
style.”

Their competition was a long
and great one, and both gained
entry into the Track 8c Field Hall of
Fame. V

“I first ran into Arnie in my jun-
ior year (1954) in the IC4A Cham-
pionships,” recalled Courtney. “At
that time I had about 10 wins in a
row and was regarded as the favor-
ite. I always thought I had a great
kick. Sowell went by me at one
point in the race, as we went into
the backstretch. I thought, ‘I ought
to go by him now. I’ll out-kick him
at the finish.’ Well, I kicked andl
couldn’t quite catch him. That was
the first of many defeats to Arnie
Sowell.

“I remember being startled by
that. At the time, he was a relative
unknown. But I got to know him

pretty well after that, and so did
everybody else in the world. I had
to revamp my training techniques
to beat him, and by doing so I set
Olympic and world. records.”

In 1979, Courtney joined Sowell
and Lon Spurrier, another world
class American half—miler on that
1956 Olympic team, for a reunion
lunch in San Francisco. Sowell
also recalls the get-together.

7‘I’m pleased with what I accomp-
lished," said Sowell, who retired in
1979 after 23 years of military ser-
vice as a lieutenant colonel in the
U.S. Army, and resides in Pacifica,
Calif., a suburb to the south of San
Francisco. He's working now as a
materials manager with Dalmo
Victor, a firm that makes early-
warning systems for military

aircraft.

“I’m somewhat disappointed in
not going as far as I had hoped to
go. My goal was to become the
Olympic champion, to be what

Tom Courtney became. But we can!-ii‘

only have one of them and he
won,” said Sowell.

Asked about the problems, with
the pre-Olympics injury he suf-
fered, and how the track surface
wasn’t in his favor, Sowell said, “I
always worked as a recreation
counselor each summer, and I got
into a pick—up basketball game. I
was going for a rebound and I came
down hard and tore ligaments in
my ankle. I was on crutches for
awhile, and missed a lot of train-
ing. There was some question as to

Women’s Sports Placed In The NCAA Limelight

By MARK A. SINDLER

Until two years ago, there wasn’t
much fanfare that women’s sports
could muster for their various com-
petitions. Most of the time, sports
that saw participation by female
athletes usually played second fid-
dle to the established regimes of
‘male-dominated kingdoms of foot-
ball and basketball.

Even before this decade, men's
and women's sports were repre-
sented by two different organiza-
tions with different guidelines for
interpreting rules. For the men,
there was the NCAA; the women
had the AIAW — the American
Intercollegiate Athletics for
Women.

This may have been the reason
that women’s sports never received

the recognition they should have.
What with Saturday afternoon
football games to watch on televi-
sion during the fall, bowl games at
the year's end and basketball’s
super-hype Final Four competi-
tion every April, sports enthusiasts
were always inundated by NCAA
and its sports.

With the AIAW, women’s sports
did not have the opportunities to
get their foot in the door and
inherit the golden TV packages
that could easily put them in the
limelight.

Well, a change is in the making,
and the possibilities for women's
sports now can only get better.
Their prospects for success are
quite inviting.

It may have taken the NCAA a
while to notice, but the male-

:I....s..v

oriented organization started grav-
itating toward the possibility of
placing women’s sports under its
umbrella after it realized the
increasing popularity, notoriety

and money that could be had by
women's sports.

There was the encouraging
notion of reaping unlimited bene-
fits should the NCAA take that step
and recognize women’s sports.

That it did now only serves as a
real boon to women’s sports.
Where the now-defunct AIAW
sponsored championships for such
sports as gymnastics, women’s vol-
leyball, basketballand swimming,

. ‘rm; 1 '1 .'t(.\ 1

the NCAA saw potential for
heightened revenue.

Promoting these championships
on television would only serve to
strengthen the NCAA and to boost
many women’s sports programs
across .the country into better
positions.

So the NCAA made its move and
amassed numerous women’s sports
teams under its affiliation. Besides
identifying with the respected
name, complying schools can now
have their travel expenses for
championship competition paid
for by the NCAA.

For women's volleyball coach
Shelton Collier, this is an incentive
he quickly points out, even though
he did give up other fringe benefits
while under AIAW affiliation.

“Last year, the NCAA made a

power play and managed to get
many big name schools. This year
they took over women’s sports
totally-, and now there is more
involvement by male administra-
tors,” Collier said.

The NCAA has different recruit-
ing rules, which, for Collier, means
he can no longer “audition” play-
ers. Now gone is the opportunity to
bring athletes in from across the
country. Now coaches can afford
the chance to watch them play in
their gyms and later show the

Coaches can still bring players
in, according to Collier, “but you
must now compete with other
schools with higher recruiting
budgets.” In short, the NCAA has

whether or not I could compete in
the Olympics. Coach and I kept it
quiet. and I was able to rehabilitate
myself enough for me to compete.

“I have no excuses. I didn't lose. I
got beaten by Tom and the other
guys. I could have done better.
That Tom, though, I always said
he could run a 1:49 in a hurricane.
It made no difference, and he could

do it running across a cornfield. I -

don’t know where Tom got that
kick to win_t_hat day.”

It was one of the few stains on
Sowell’s record, and it couldn't
erase all his remarkable achieve-
ments at Pitt.

“He is,” said Olson, “a good-
will ambassador for Pitt.”

~George Kiseda covered Pitt
sports in those days for the now-
defunct Pittsburgh Sun-
Telegraph, and he cared about
track and field. Kiseda crusaded for
the sport, but to no avail. Only a
few fans, friends and relatives
turned out for track meets in Pitts-
burgh back then, and it’s no differ-
ent today. Sowell was :4 magnate
and often the main draw when
50,000 turned out for a track meet
in Los Angeles, and 20,000 in New
York and Philadelphia, but he
went largely ignored in his
hometown.

Kiseda is still critical of Olson’s
training methods. “He was train-
ing Arnie Sowell the same way he
had trained John Woodruff 20
years earlier,” claims Kiseda, a Pitt
alumnus who works today as a
copy editor in the sports depart-
ment of the Los Angeles Times.
“He didn’t adopt more modern
training concepts, such as interval
training. He thought you ran dis-
tance for endurance and sprints for
speed, and that was about it.

“Sowell was so good, there’s no
telling how great he could have
been if he had been trained better.
But Olson was a good man other-
wise, and more than Pitt bargained

for, considering they weren’t that

interested in track.

“It’s amazing that, in a city «that
iliiilttt sate f<ll?lR_lll task, and at a
school that paid no attention to
track, they had two of the greatest
half-milers of all time——in the

world! Woodruff was awesome. He
did things that were astonishing.
And, if Olson had adapted to mod-
ern training methods. there’s no
telling what Sowell could have
done.”

Rees is too smart, and too diplo-
matic, to get into the middle of that
controversy, and Olson is dead and
can't defend himself. Let it be
known, however, that Rees didn't
always agree with Olson’s
methods.

Rees remembers Sowell single-
handedly—or should it be single-
leggedly?—beating Army in an
indoor meet at West Point.

“They had so much more depth
than us," recalls Rees. “But Arnie
won the 600 and the 1,000, and
scored in the longjump, and then
anchored our mile and two-mile
relay teams to victory. The amaz-
ing thing is that the relays were run
right after each other——back-to-
back—and Sowell still pulled it off.
We had to win the last relay to win
it, and we did. He did. It was one of
the most amazing one-man perfor-
mances I’ve ever seen in track.”

Sowell was so versatile, a coach
could use him in any of eight
events, and as many as four or five,
in any particular meet. Carl
Hughes, who reported on Pitt
sports back then for The Pitts-
burgh Press, often referred to him
as “Amazin’ Arnie” Sowell.

“Pitt has as close to a track super-
man,” wrote Hughes, “as there is
in the world today.”

“One of the things that benefit-
ted me as far as having Olson for a
coach,” says Sowell now, “was that
he insisted I be a well-conditioned
athlete. Maybe he didn’t have all
the modern techniques, but I think
I accomplished as much as I think I
could have under Coach Olson.

“Lloyd Duff was his assistant
when I first got there, and he got
me involved with interval training.
Olson was very team—oriented, but
Duff believed in developing an
individual star, too. He believed
that if somebody could accomplish
something special, he should be
given every opportunity to do so.”

As an 18-year-old sophomore,
Sowell broke the school’s half-mile
mark set by Woodruff in .-1939,

Pitt’s

establishing a new mark at the
lC4A meet at Randall's Island in
New York.

He broke Woodruff’s 15-year-old
record in that event with a 1250.3
clocking. He followed that up by
winning the NCAA 880 at
Michigan.

As a junior, Sowell beat the
seemingly unbeatable Mal Whit-
field in winning the 800-meter
event in the Pan American Games
in the record time of 1249.8.

In April, 1955, he led Pitt to a
72-59 victory over Navy at Annapo-
lis. Sowell won the 440 and broad
jump events, finished third in the
880 with teammates coming in
ahead of him, and then ran a bril-
liant 46.7 anchor leg as the Panther
mile relay team won that event in
3:l6.6.

That same campaign, he tied the
world's 1000-yard indoor record of
2:082 at the National AAU cham-
pionships in Madison Square
Garden. He also won the title in
1956. ~

Sowell won the half-mile three
years in a row at the lC4A meet. As
a sophomore, he set an lC4A record
of 1:503. As a junior, he lowered it

to l:49.6 in the National AAU.

At the lC4A Indoor Champion-
ships at Madison Square Garden in
1956, Sowell won the 1,000-yard,
anchored Pitt to a two-mile relay
win and placed third in the long
jump.

In a victory over Miami of Ohio
at Pitt Stadium, he won the broad
jump, the half mile, anchored the
winning mile relay team and was
third in the high jump.

In a triangular meet against
Army and Ohio State at the Sta-
dium, Sowell won the half-mile
and quarter-mile, then anchored
the winning mile relay team, mak-
ing up a 15 yard-deficit on Ohio
State’s Meade Burnette, a top
runner.

Ohio State’s coach Larry Snyder
cheered Sowell at the finish line.
“We lost it to one of the greatest I
ever looked at,” said Snyder.
“Sowell isn’t only wonderful, he’s
impossible." Sowell had just run
the fastest quarter mile ever
clocked.

An Army cadet came up to
Sowell as he was walking off the
track into the dressing room.
“Congratulations, Arnie, you’re

All~Time Greatest Runner

the best," said the cadet, as he
vigorously shook Sowell‘s hand.
“Thanks, that’s nice of you,” said
Sowell.

He won the MVP awards for
track and cross-country at Pitt in
1956, and was honored by a dinner
held by the Varsity Letter Club at
the Schenley Park Hotel.

Sports Magazine named Sowell
the outstanding track 8: field ath-
lete in 1956. “This kid," said Coach
Olson, “has been publicized until
he seems not human.”

Sowell considers coming back to
Pittsburgh to work. The place still
holds a lot of appeal to him.

“I’m glad I went to Pitt, and I’m
glad I was on the track team there,
even though it never got the atten-
tion that I thought it should have,”
he said. “Under Olson, at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, I was
required to get an education. To-
me, that's bottom line.

“Olson always told me thatfame
is fleeting, that they forget. He told
me you can be a great athlete, and
that was nice, but he asked, ‘What
are you going to do afterward?’
That's what gives me the most
pleasure about my Pitt
experience."

NCAA Shines Light On Women

entered the women’s sports market,
there are some women athletic
directors who refused to make the
transition, Collier said. Some were
left behind because of the AIAW
bent towards identifying under this
organization.

“They strongly sided with the
AIAW,” Collier said. “They are the
ones who wanted women to con-
trol women sports. Now that they
are under the guidelines of the
NCAA they have negative feelings
and animosity.”

Even so, Collier now sees the
chance to slide funds away from the
male sports and inject them into
women’s so “as many female ath-
letes can be helped out as are the
ones in football and basketball.”

Accordingly, athletic director Ed
Bozik and women’s athletic direc-
tor Sandy Bullman are now reas-

sessing their priorities.
Meantime, Collier is quite
pleased over his team's entrance
into the Big East conference, which
has given women’s volleyball -
among six other women’s sports —

a real shot in the arm.

Said Collier, after Dave Gavitt,
Big East’s commissioner, addressed
the coaches at the championships
in Providence last weekend, “He
assured us that the Big East is
excited to have women’s volleyball
and willing to make it first class,
with awards, officials and well-run
tournaments.”

During that weekend, Collier
was appointed president of the Big

East Women's Volleyball Coaches
Association. While in this posi-
tion, he will represent the positions
and needs of associate members
and serves as a group liaison.

“I feel a responsibility tohelp
other programs and coaches to
achieve the level of success and sta-
tus that we deserve,” Collier said.
“The stronger the conference the
better and the more highly
regarded we will be.”

By associating with the Big‘ East
Collier foresees limitless potential.
His Lady Panthers will be aided by
the men’s basketball image and the
media coverage, which he says has
been more important this year than
in any other.

“It will also unify the women’s
athletic department,” he con-
tinued. “There will now bea com-
mon goal and objective — win the
Big East. Before, there really wasn't
a common goal amongst us, but
now the coaching staffs and their
players have a common purpose.”

Panthers Look To Penn State

continued from page seven
how the Panthers’ ability overcame
the “revenge factor."

The Panthers suffered their first
loss three weeks ago to Notre
Dame. On the other hand, the Nit-
tany Lions only loss--_to
Alabama—occurred at the begin-
ning of October. Since they came
from behind two weeks ago to
defeat the Irish, they are likely to
have an edge at Friday’s game.

The general consensus of the
players, however, is that being the
underdog against Penn State will
give them the edge.

“I’m glad we will be the under-
dog, that will make us work
harder,” Julius Dawkins said.
Dawkins’ cohort Collins added, “It
will be good to be the underdog

J because they will forget what we

can do."

Marino throws out the notion of
any underdogs or favorites when
the two rivals meet.

“Any time we play Penn State, it
is a great game,” he said. “There is
no underdog, just two quality foot-
ball teams."

Penn State coach Joe Paterno
constructed a schedule that could
increase the Lions’ edge. It is not
that Penn State's competition is
any weaker that Pitt’s—in fact it
was rated the second toughest sche-
dule in the country—-it is due to the
extra week to get ready for the
Pathers.

“Penn State had last week off to
prepare for us,” tailback Bryan
Thomas said. “We're going to have
to prepare extra hard. We're on an
upswing, and wejust got to carry it

through to next Friday.”

The Panthers agree that a bowl
title will not mean as much as
intrastate braggng rights

“Without a win at Penn State,
the Cotton Bowl will not mean as
much," said offensive guard Rob
Fada. Similar sentiments were
echoed by Thomas, “If we don't
beat Penn State, the bowl will not
have the same meaning."

The Lions will be the toughest
challenge the Panthers face all sea-
son, as Covert said, “We have con-
trol of our own destiny. We're
going to have to play the game of
our lives to beat Penn State."

An invitation to the Cotton Bowl
is a great honor, but without a win
over Penn State this prestigious
bowl will be little more than an
extra game.

Offense

touchdowns. The Panther line
sacked Rutgers quarterback
Jacques LaPrarie five times for
minus 54 yards, with defensive end
Al Wenglikowski getting two.

“The defense was outstanding,”
Fazio said. “The linebackers were
getting great drops and contained
the Rutgers quarterback well."

“()ffer1sively we just gave the
ball away too many times,” Burns
said. “We played a fine football
team, and the combination of the
Pitt defense and our lack of offense
was too much.”

One concern going into the
Penn State game is injuries. Tackle
Bill Fralic sat out of Saturday's
game with a pinched nerve, adding
to the number of Panther
wounded. However, Jim Sweeney,
normally a center, filled in capably
for Fralic. _

Fazio is confident some of the
injured players will be able to see
action against Penn State.

_ Pitt quarterback Dan Marino compiled the kind of sta-
tlstics Saturday that he was accustomed to amassing

regularly last season.

Penn State," Fazio said. “Tim
Lewis might be ready to play; he
sprained his ankle again. Tom
Flynn is still questionable, and
right now, it looks like John
Brown has an excellent chance of
playing.”

Lewis came out of the first play
of the game with the injury while
Fada left later in the first quarter.

There was plenty of celebration
in the locker room about the Cot-
ton Bowl bid; Fazio was grateful to
the committee.

“We want to express our appre-
ciation to the Cotton Bowl people
because they stuck with us and had
confidence in us," Fazio said after
L. Hoffines, Jr., president of the
Cotton Bowl Committee, extended
the invitation. “It means a lot to us.
Our seniors and starters had a
meeting Monday, and at that time,
there was no doubt that we wanted
to go to the Cotton Bowl.”

However, there’s still the game at
Penn State Friday.
