Halliday Reports Pitt
Higher Than Average

In Science Majors

by ANN DORN

Science magazine in a recent issue, reported that the number
of majors in the natural sciences dropped 15 per cent between
1960 and 1965, while college enrollment was up 50 per cent. 
drop occurred in spite of the national campaign to increase the
-interest in science, said the Science editorial.

But, according to Dr. David Halliday, Dean of Natural Sci-
ences, the University stands above the national average in the
number of undergraduates majoring in the natural sciences.

Dean Halliday stated that the number of science majors at

-the University is not in accord
been going up,” he said. Accord-
ing to Dean Halliday’s statis-
tics, the number of majors in
mathematics is 137, in chemis-
try is 121, in physics is 25, in
earth and planetary is nine, and
in biophysics is seven. In con-
trast with the national ﬁgures,
Dean Halliday said that these
areas" at the University have
shown a .“modest growth.”
Dean Halliday stat_ed.that the
greatest amount of science ma-
jors are in biology, with 220, and
psychology, with 210, which have
both shown a tremendous in-
crease in the past few years.
Unlike other areas of science,
he said that “the increase in the
interest of life sciences is a
deﬁnite national trend.”

He continued, “The whole ﬁeld _

of biology is undergoing a rev-
olution. It is changing dramati-
cally, and it is now possible to
do many. exciting things. It
could be compared to the ‘ en-
thusiasm in the field of physics
in the 1930’s.”

He emphasized that although
the interest in physics has de-
clined in the past years the num-
ber of undergraduates majoring
in physics at the University “has
not gone down” and even has
shown a slight increase.

Science's editorial stated that

in science majors has been the
increase in pressure on high
school students. It upheld ‘-that
many college-bound students
could not bring themselves to
face continuing years of the Ad-
vanced Placement work they
‘had received in high school.
Dean Halliday did not agree
with that statement. He said
that although he had no statis-
tics, he believed that the nation-
al decrease was “not generally
caused by high school pres-sure.”

Fraternity Dean Wants
Good Neighbor Relations  

by PAUL STOLLER

Improved neighborhood - fra-
ternity relati-ons will be the most
-immediate goal of Louis McLin-
den, recently appointed associ-
ate dean of men for fra-ternities.
McClinden assumed his position
last Monday.

“There is a problem of the
changing character of the Oak-
land neighborhood,” said McLin-
den. “A number of new apart-
ment buildings have been built
adjacent to many of our fra-
ternity houses. Consequently,
there has recently been an in-
creasing number of complaints
concerning fraternity men from
these new neighbors,” McLin-
den pointed out, ‘

According to McLinden, these
complaints have ranged from
playing a phonograph too loud-
ly tosunbathing on the roof of
a fraternity house.

“These neighborhood relations
could be enhanced,” stated Mc-
Linden, “if the fraternities on
campus set up a program which
would endeavor to invite some

A of the neighbors to the fraterni-

ty houses.” McLinden stressed
that the problem of neighbor-

hood relations should be recti- .

tied.

McLinden believed that hous-
ing is of key importance to- the
future of the fraternity system
at the University. “My long‘
range goal as assistant dean of

_ men for fraternities is to pro-

cure University owned housing
for fraternities.” McLinden, how-
ever, could give no guarantees
that University owned housing
could be procured for fraterni-

' ties.

“I’m looking forward to a year
of expansion for the Greek sys-

tem at the University,” said. Me-
Linden. “The dip in the out-of-
state ratio has no real effect on
the Greek system. What We are
looking for is a student who is
interested in extracurricular ac-
tivities.” From many indications,
the typical student of the in-
coming freshman class has a
good deal of interest in extra-
curricular activities, he added.
McLinden also believes that

“there is no room for hazing in
-the fraternity system.” He made
references to many fraternities
that have nationally condemzned
hazing. However, McLinden
stressed “that a movement to
abolish hazing would have to
come from the campus frater-
nities themselves.” Healsopoint
ed out that some forms of haz-
ing can be positive in that some
“good” can come from them.

Doctor Van Dusen Receives

“Look” Analyzes Student Emotional Problems

by BEVERLY LOY TAYLOR
While only a small propor-
tion of colleges can give their
students professional help
with mental problems, the
number of psychotics on the
campus rises, suicides ex-
ceed 1,000 this school year and
more students drop out for emo-
tional reasons than ﬂunk out.
According to a report in the
current issue of\Look magazine,
only 76 colleges and universities
can give students counseling by
professional psychologists and
psychiatrists in campus clinics.
Meanwhile, for every 10,000
college students, says Dr. Dana;
L. Farnsworth, director of the
Harvard University Health Serv-
ices:
> 1,000 will have emotional con-
Flicts severe enough to need
professional help;

>300400 will have feelings of.

depression deep enough to im-
pair their efficiency;

>100-200 will be apathetic and -

unable to organize themselves;
>20-50 will be seriously affect-

ted by conﬂicts within the
family; 0

i F 15-25 will need treatment in a

 

   

 
 

mental -hospital; V
> 5-20 will attempt suicide;
>1-3 will succeed.

Universities, to their credit will
accept those disturbed young-
sters they can handle. Ten.years
ago some 75 per cent of all col-
leges refused to admit students
who had a record of psychiatric
illness. Now, less than a quarter
still throw up this barrier to
admission.

A psychiatrist for Amherst
and Smith Colleges explains,
“We have students who are
quite psychotic, and this is not
known to their peers or anyone
else. They graduate, sometimes
with honors, The severity of a
student's problem may not be
reﬂected in his work. Emotional
pa-in can'be kept a remarkably
private affair."

The article states that the‘
“range of emotional hurt on‘

campus is broad. It reaches from
the suicidal and psychotic ex-
treme to the kid who can't
study." Their emotional prob-
lems surface when students ex-
perlence their reactions to pres-

sure frorn professors, college,

parents, or to themselves. I ..

7’

These students ask: Who, am‘, _

   

I? What will I become? Why
am I in college? What about the
draft? What do I value? What
are my morals? They go to the
clinics feeling distraught, anxi-
ous, depressed.

The article noted that colleges
strive to keep disturbed students
on the campus and in class.
There is little help available on
the ou-tside. Doctors are scarce
and clinics are crowded. Mental
hospitals and clinics have wait-
ing l-ists of 1-3 years. On cam-
pus, a student will be seen im-
mediately for diagnosis and if
he isn’t in serious trouble, he
will be given an appointment.

T re a t m e n-t at Pennsylvania

State University can include liv-.

ing in the school hospital and
going out to classes. L-ast year
the University of Massachusetts
put 60 disturbed students (out
of 830 treated) in the college
inﬂrmary to help t-hem control
their illnesses.

"Colleges will change exam

dates, alter courses, delay pa».

pers to ease tension. They be-
lieve that the student. gets bet-
ter treatment at the school than
he often gets atlhome. If he's
sent home,‘ that's another fail-

 

ure for him. The student who
graduates from college has a
better chance for long-term ther-
apy. College is one task he's
completed. _ . ‘

Kansas State University -has a
halfway house in a regular
dorm. Some 600 stud-en-ts live
there—-12 of them volunteers
and 12 students who are as dis-
turbed as they can _be and still
function as students. Several of
them have been in the student
health service hospital. Quite a
few have been given medica-
tion. All of the patients are in
psychotherapy and counseling.

College psychologists and psy-
chiatrists know that these dis-
turbed students will be parents
some day. They must be helped
with their. deeper problems as
well as their present difficulties.
It is preventive psychiatry ——
-seeing that the problem is not
carried over into the next gen-
eration.

Unfortunately, too few college
students get help. They'll carry
their ‘problems to their families,
jobs, and town’s.lFor most of

‘them, there is no halfway house. ~

 
 
 
 

 
 
  

“Your scholarship and promi-
nence as a scientist who has ap-
plied the principles of human
relations and psychology to busi-

    .
by the journals which have

sought your ideas and the cor-
porations which have sought
your advice,” the citation also
stated.

On the Friday before com-
mencement exercises, Dr. Van
Dusen spoke at Honors Day ex-
ercises at Duquesne.

Speaking on “The Academy
Walls,” Van Dusen compared to-
day's college students who pro-
test with signs, dress, and beard
to the “free thinkers of yester-
year.

“We can understand the quest
of these young people today
without agreeing either with

that quest or with the methods’

they choose to demonstrate it,”
Dr. Van Dusen stated. -

At the Sunday commence-
ment, awards were also given

to the Rev. Martin C. D'Arcy, _

ber, and Governor Raymond P.

Committee
Investigates

Book Center

Pursuant to an announcement
that he was setting up a Book
Center Committee, Chancellor-

Emeritus (then Chancellor) Da-—

vid Kurtzman recently sent a
memo to members of the com-
mittee, concerning the need to
examine the policies of the Book
Center.‘

The following ﬁve items were
to be discussed: discount poli-
cies; items to be carried; book
return policy; caps and gowns;
and the question of whether the
Book Center should emphasize

strictly University service or,
com-,

broaden its service to the
mun“? s

  
 

. abil- 0

 

 
 
  
 

 

 

ran rrrr‘NEw’s — ‘Fl-1day;‘June‘9.

The initial meeting Wednesday of the Book Center Committee to re-
solve the current policy governing our Book Center ended unfortunately in
a dismal adjournment.

The meeting was dismissed after a 10-minute session ‘because the
chairman, Edison Montgomery, strongly objected to the fact that all mem-
bers were not present. Five of the nine committee members were there
and they did represent a cross-section of administrators, faculty members
and students. T

We do not quibble with this objection. We do object to the lack of
trust on the part of the administration to even engage in an off-the-record
discussion of the problems involved. The key, personnel concerned were in
the room’ and an exchange of ideas at this time would have accomplished
the vital purpose of finding out what the objectives were of all parties
involved.

We are pleased to see that the University administration has desig-
nated as Committee representatives such high-ranking men as Assistant

i to the Chancellor Edison Montgomery and Assistant to the Vice-Chancellor

for Finance David Smith. The participation of these policy makers under-
scores their interest in establishing an effective Book Center policy.

However, the decision to include students on this Committee will only ‘

be worthwhile if the communications breakdown which occurred last

_‘Wednesday morning is remedied immediately. The Book Center Committee

can accomplish a great deal, but before anything noteworthy is done, the
administration should understand the basic issues as we see them.
First of all, we are calling for a re-evaluation of the Monnett-Vrana

agreement, which stated that the Book Center proﬁts should be divided

‘ Faltering   Beginning    

was made with the knowledge that there would be no profits for several
years. The clause in the agreement that speciﬁed that SG would have
access to the profit-and-loss statement has never been reinforced by allow-
mg students who requested that statement to see the profit - and-loss
records. ‘

Secondly, the conflict of interest question concerning Auxiliary Enter-
prises Director John C. Langstaff’s dual capacity as director of the Uni-
versity Book Center and private owner of Your Campus Store has never
been satisfactorily resolved. Langstaff is in a position where he is directly
competing with the University in the sale of such items as those bearing
the University seal. However, Langstaff’s store carries a much wider se-
lection. This policy is rationalized by the argument that carrying com-
mercial items is contrary to the idea established several years ago to main-
tain a “quality” Book Center.

. A third question to discuss is Chancellor Emeritus David H. Kurtz-
man’s statement for the record that he “is in favor of a ﬁve per cent uni-
form discount” and would make every attempt to put this into practice.
This item has to be resolved shortly or -we will not be able to see the dis-

count become a reality for the coming school year, as budgets are now
. being planned. -

Before any of the three items on the students’ agenda can be effec-
tively discussed however, there is an urgent need for an attempt to remedy
the communications breakdown that was so apparent at last Wednesday's
meeting. For unless there is an atmosphere of mutual trust and respect,
we must question whether the pressing problems at hand can be satis-
factorily resolved.

Bemis Hit Again
By Soccer Player

Editor, The Pitt News:

It simply amazes me how Bill
Zursola can suddenly become so
team conscious and pro Mr. Be-
mis where Igycrarlgj clearly remem-
-ber Mr. Zurzola on several oc-

U 1 ca-sions last season describing

Mr. Bemis with unprintable ad-
jectives. As a matter of fact Mr.
Zurzola even walked off the ﬁeld

, during a game at Forbes Field

last year, because he thought he
should have been playing m-ore
than he was. I also can remem-
ber his feelings about Mr. Be-
mxis when he was a sophomore
and riding the bench the year
we went to the NCAA playoffs.
_ To say they were the exact
opposite of what he WI‘0’£e in
his article of May 19 is putting
it lightly, but I guess Mr. Zur-
zola forgot about those things.
I would like to know why.Mr.

_Zurzola didn't attend more

spring practices this year if he
was sqvery worried about next
seasoii? I also wish Mr. Zur-
zola would make up his mind.

.First he tells us in his article

"No coach gets his team aNCAA
berth unless he has something

on the ball” but then he finishes

Letters to the Editor

by saying, “Mr. Bemis isn't a
‘great coach, perhaps not a good
one-— . . .” and “Coaches don’t
win games, they ﬁeld the teams.”
I think his conscience must have
bothered him by then, so as not
to leave us with too high of an
opinion of Mr Bemis’ coaching
abilities, he had to tone it down.

Before I start I have to make
one thing ‘clear, so that in the
following issues of the Pitt News
some “concerned player” doesn't
try to enlighten me. As a hu-
man being, there are few, ﬁner
men than Mr. Bemis. However,
his coaching is another thing
and that is what I want to talk
about. A

Every year there are a fair
amount of seniors that Mr. Be-
mis doesn't get along with. And
every year he tries his hardest
to make those seniors out as
rebels, troublemakers, outcasts
from the rest of the team (dur-
ing my four years here, two of
-the years y his captains were
among t-hose seniors). He tells
them they don’t have team spir-
it and they are ruining his team.
Every year the ﬁrst two weeks
of practice are spent worrying
about team spirit ,(but not by
instilling desire into the players,
but by talking about it). During
every pre-season practice there

is this feeling of uncertainty

around; does this team have a,

strong captain who will keep
the team together, or are there
going to be little factions which
the coach can't handle because
he lacks conviction or because
he just simply doesn't know
what his team is thinking about.

If Mr. Bemis would lead his
team, be a “coach” and not just
by title, he wouldn’t have to say
a thing about team spirit, be-
cause the guys would auto-
matically play their hearts out
for him. It's called motivation.
So to hide his mistakes he needs
a scapegoat every year that he
has a bad record. And every

‘year the seniors that are leaving

and Mr. Bemis doesn’t like are
his lscapegoats. I would just like
to know one thing Mr. Bemis,
did you ever have a bad year
because you blew half, or more,
of the games that you lost?

The few years that the team
had a strong captain who’ ran
things and did Mr. Bemis’ job,
there was no trouble. But when
-it’s someone that doesn't stare
him in the face and says a plain
determined NO (like Jim Cud-
dy did two years ago when Mr.
Bemis wanted to platoon a goalie
who in his ﬁrst year set two
school records, just so he would-
n’t hurt the feelings of the other
one), then the whole team he-
comes as indecisive as Mr. Be-

~mis is. When this occurs there

are always two kinds of team
members.

First those that know Mr.
Bemis isn't a coach, but just en-
dure the whole thing so that
their scholarship won’t be taken
and so that they get to play a
lot during the games. They are
the ones that tell you behind
Mr. Bemis’ back, “Just don’t say
anything, keep quiet and stay
on his good side, you play more
that way.” Second, there are
those players that had good
coaches before and know how

poor of a job Mr. Bemis does‘

and want desperately to be a
member of a team that they try
to change things on their own
(which the coach should be do-

The Colossal Redundancy

The U.N. And War

by Alan Disler

SEVERAL BRAZILIAN and Indian troops, attached
to the United Nations Emergency Force in -the Middle East,
were recently killed during the Arab-Israeli War.

_ They died for an ideal. That the ideal should be unat-
ta_1nab_le, and the faint hope of achieving it cynically kept
alive, is truly tragic.

For. the United Nations has once again demonstrated
that it is somewhat less than The World's Only Hope for
Eternal Peace. ' e '

THE UNITED Nations failed to prevent the Middle
East War. It failed to prevent the War in the Congo. It
failed to prevent the Pakistani-Indian War. It did not pre-
vent the Yemini War, the Vietnam War, or the Korean War.
It was impotent in staving off armed conflict between India
and Red China, and Indonesia and Malaysia. The United
Nations has not done what it was created to do. It has not
paciﬁed the world.

. Furthermore, it probably never will. The United Na-
tions is merely a reflection of the world power relations
that existed after World War II. The structure of the Se-
curity Council, the only body of the U.N. authorized to de-
ploy international troops, and particularly endowed with
the task of preventing the use of force anywhere in the
world, assures the major powers a veto on any action that
that body may take. -

Not coincidentally, this has been the general pattern
of international relations since the end of the Second World
War. No major power could drastically upset the balance
without precipitating another power to move the fulcrum
and right the equillibrium. The counter-thrust of one power
to another’s aggressive thrust can be roughly equated with
the Security Council veto. '

IN OTHER words, nothing the Great Powers would do
anyway is prevented by the U.N. Conversely, nothing the
Great _Powers wouldn’t do, or wouldn’t want done, is not
ventured legally by the United Nations. The Security Coun-
cil is rough, microcosmic, simulacrum of the world rela-
tionships. * .

The United Nations is a colossal redundancy. It would
be funny if men did not die in its name, carrying its flag.
For what could be more ludicrous than witnessing the Sc-
curity Council deadlocked for hours, deliberating on the
Arab-Israeli. War, only to have the ﬁnal proposal agreed
upon outside the Council, in ante rooms and corridors, and
perfunctorily voted for in unanimous agreement. And,
rightly enough, it was not until the Soviet Union and the
United States agreed did the Council finally reach a solu-
tion.

That there have been no wars among the Great Powers
is no testimonial to the U.N. For when the interests of the

Great Powers are critically at stake, such as in the Cuban .

Missile Crisis, the U.N. is craftily by-passed. It was normal
diplomacy that prevented war in that case, and hardly the
United Nations. The Security Council would have been
vetoed out of participation.

THAT THE U.N. was meant to be an approximation of
the world power relationships cannot be doubted. If it was
not meant to be so, it assuredly would not have been_ agreed
to by the Great Powers. But it is a rough approxlmlation
It is artificial, and it does not allow for changing world
patterns. ' ' , _, ' ,

ZBT Captures League Softball Crown

(Special to the Pitt News)

Zeta Beta Tau won the un-
dergraduate league softball
title by downing a previous-
ly unbeaten team of Panther
football players 6 -3 in the
cham-pionship game Wednesday
afternoon.

The Zeebs defeated Phi Kap-
pa Theta Tuesday, 5-3, to reach
the title game. The football play-
ers also gained a spot in the
championship game by winning
an a forfeit by the Commuters.

In the ﬁn-als, ZBT combined
the t-hree-hit pitch-ing of Jay Ro-
senstein and a tight defense to
gain victory. The Zeebs took the
lead for good in the second inn-
-ing when, with the score tied
1-1, Neil Guberman lashed a
oneout single to left. Art Rosen-
garten and Rosenste-in then
blasted back-to-back home runs
to make it 4-1.

ZBT got an insurance run in
the fourth on an RBI single by
Jeff Gerson, but the gridders
came back with two runs in
their hall.’ of the inning on dou-
bles by Skip Orszulak and Al
Nalli and a Zeeb error.

There was no more scoring

until the seventh inning when
ZBT scored a run on a bases-

loaded grounder by Bob Ziff. ‘

half of the inning, but two run-
ning catches by Jeff Heimberg
in center ﬁeld saved the victory.
Both teams’ high-scoring of-
fenses were held in check by
pitchers Rosenstein and loser
Jay McCune, McCune was heard
muttering as he trudged off the
mound after the game, “How
can we beat Notre Dame if we
can’t even beat the Zeebs?”
The footballers ﬁnished the
season with a 4-1 record. Let by
the hitting of Lou Parrott, Ed

Whittaker, and Pete Smith, they '

averaged 20 runs a game until
Wednesday's ﬁnale. With a sol-
id inﬁeld, anchored by third
baseman Frank Hartz, plus the
deceptive pitching of Jay Mc-
Cune, the gridders posed a for-
midable threat on the baseball
diamond. _

In the semi-ﬁnals, ZBT got
off to a shaky start as the Phi

Kaps scored three runs in the 

top of the ﬁrst inning on a hit
and two errors. The Zeebs tied :
it up in the last of the ﬁrst, with I

bats of Heimberg and Bob Grop-

- The winners scored two in
the second on a bases~loaded
single by Gerson and a sacniﬁce
ﬂy by Joel Schlesinger. Both
teams were blanked t-he rest of
the way.

With undergraduate league
play completed, Heimberg clear-
ly emerged as the batting hero.
The Zeeb centerﬁelder socked
six home runs, had 20 RBI’s,
and had a. slugging average of
over 2,000. With the all-campus
championship game with the
graduate league champions re‘-
maining, Zeeb hopes rest heavi-
ly on }Ieimberg’s bat.

reasons for ZBT’s success. Bill

get-her, while the outﬁeld was
more than adequate. With Ro-
senstein’s pitching improving
every game, opponents found it
difficult to score runs. Zeeb bat-
ters, averaging 20 hits a game,
gave the team the oﬁensive
punch it needed to go all the
way.

The ﬁnal standings showed
ZBT in ﬁrst. with the gridders
winding up in second. The Phi
Kaps, paced by long-ball hitting
ﬁrst baseman Tom Sitoski, ﬁn-
ished in third place, while the
Commuters eased into fo-urtlh.

Hallowed tradition
of "pinning" a girl is
up-dated by

Sprite bottle caps.

According to an independent survey (we took it
ourselves), a startling new practice is becoming
widespread on some college campuses.

Suddenly, fraternity men are no longer "pinning"
the lovely young things that catch their eye.

Instead, they reach for a bottle of tart,
tingling Sprite--and proceed to "cap"
their affections.

Why has this
come about?
Perhaps because
«ofwhathappens
. when you go
throughtheceremony ofopening a bottle ofSprite.
It fizzes! Roars! Buzzes! Tingles!Bubbles!

All of which makes for a much more moving moment
than to simply "pin" a girl.

Then, too, the intimacy of two people engaged
in the act of opening a bottle of Sprite in itself
leads to strong emotional involvement.

Capped off, of course, by the sharing of a
few moments of delicious abandon. (Tasting the
tingling tartness of Sprite, that is.)

The beauty of the idea is that if the course
of true love does not run smooth, you don't have
to go to the trouble of getting back your pin.

You just buy another bottle of Sprite.
