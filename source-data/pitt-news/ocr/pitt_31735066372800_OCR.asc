Formed

’ By DEBBIE WEINSTEIN

A special task force designed
“exclusively” to look into finan-
.cial aid for higher education was
established at last Friday's Student
Government Board (SGB) meet-
ing, according to board member
Chip Roth.

“Designed for nothing but an
examination of financial aid poli-

_ cies, we hope to persuade many stu-
dents to organize opposition to

: cuts,” Roth said. One of our goals

.i is to coax students into writing

.their congressmen and state
representatives-—-in short, to let the

voice of student opposition be_

' heard.” '

Une of the first things planned
by the Student Government Task
Force for Financial Aid--a group
comprised of a voting member
from every. recognized student
Speakers’-
Forum scheduled for Friday,
March 19, at noon in room 120

| , David Lawrence.

Guests slated to speak inciuue
U.S.‘ Representative Bill Coyne,
State Representatives
Walgren and Frank Pistella, and

Cyril Wecht, democratic candidate _

for the U.S. Senate. Also, according
to Roth, the task force is awaiting
replies from Governor Dick

Thornburg, U.S. Senator John »

Heinz, U.S. Congressman Eugene

Atkinson, Chancellor Wesley Pos- -

U.S. Needs New Policy

var and Allen Ertel, a democratic
candidate for governor.

Roth said the specific topic of the

_ forum will be financial aid cuts’

effects on students, although the

speakers ‘Twill probably address

funding for other domestic pro-
grams” as well.

SGB President Todd DeLuca
said the task force is needed because
“students ought to become edu-

i cated about the cuts, and what they

4 .can do about them.

"I’m expecting a large number
of students at the meeting because

thosekcutbacks are really affecting
everyone,” DeLuca said. “We want
students to get involved and stop
the threat of financial aid
cutbacks.”

In other business,‘ the board
accepted the resignation of Aca-

‘ demic Affairs Committee Chair-

man Ron Barber, who indicated he
would like to devote more time to
other academic commitments. The
board praised Barber for his pro-
ductive work as chairman and indi-
cated that they will appoint a
committee to find a new chairman,
according to Roth.

Also at Friday's meeting, the
SGB announced it will conduct a
survey of student attitudes towards
the Student Health Center. Accord-
ing to Roth, the survey is designed
to explore ways of countering»the
proposed 43 percent increase in
student health fees announced
recently by Student Health Service
director Franklin Carter.

The United States should
develop a workable policy to deal
with the disintegration of the
Soviet Empire and avoid dangers
that might threaten World Warlll,
according to Pitt Political Science
Professor Richard Cottam.

Cottam, speaking at the Univer-
sity Honors Program Noontime
Lecture Series Thursday, said that
the Soviet UniQ_n__ has Qver—
extended itself in Poland and Af-
ghanistan and cannot hold on to
them for much longer.

U.S. policy dealing with this
“disintegration of the Soviet

empire” should not only be made’

so we can survive but should also
help to make it easier for the
Soviets to surrender these places,
Cottam said.

He suggested two approaches.
The first is to “encourage a trend of
increasing importance or consum-

er bureaucracy.” This can be done.

by increasing interdependence
among countries.

However, this interdependence
between the two countries should
not be increased in periods of crisis,
he said.

A second approach Cottam sug-
gested would be to “cooperate with
the Soviets politically in other

Pitt’s Darrell Gisseanheribegins th
tship win-by cutting down thenet Saturday night in the Civi

e celebration of the P

parts of the world.”

Two areas in which he would
like to see this happen are the Mid-
dle East and the Persian Gulf,
which he said is often termed “the
flash-point for World War III.”

Cottam then gave what he
believes to be two essentially bad
tactics used in dealing with the
problems of Soviet disintegration
and their relations with the U.S.

One is attacking nuclear weap-
ons. He believes this is wrong
because it is an attack on a symp-
tom rather than a cause and
because “it’s the fact of fear.of
nuclear holocaust that prevents us
from having the kind of warfare we
engaged in so casually before.”

Another bad tactic. according to
Cottam, is attacking ULJK deteiise
policy through the budget.

“We are not challenging the
defense policy, we're just saying
that you can do it cheaper,” he said.

A problem Cottam recognizes is
that no one in, the U.S. is really
looking at the Soviet disintegra-
tion problem seriously.

“I don’t see the American public,
the American foreign policy practi-
tioners, the American politicians,
academics or students addressing
this seriously,” he said.

Cottam said this mystifies him
because he sees the Europeans
addressing it and he believes that

they are not superior to us.

While describing the situation
the Soviet Union is in today, he
also gave his picture of what that
country is like.

Describing the U.S..S.R. as “one

, of the most conservative countries

the world has ever seen” and “capa-

ble ot terrible brutality,” Cottam,

said he also sees similarities
between the two “historic empires”
and U.S.S.R.) since
World War II, both have.expanded
out of-fear of one another.

“If this is true, it means that the:
Cold War, with its horrible loss of
resources, was not necessary,” he
added.

“I believe that they, like us, are
badly overextended and that they
are going to have to retreat, and
that Poland is simply a manifesta-
tion of this,” he said.

Cottam emphasized his point by
drawing a“ parallel between the
present situation i_n_ Poland and the
shah’s regimen: iran.

Both regimes cameto power in
part because of involvement of the
super powers, he said, adding that
neither was a legitimate nationalist
regime and that the people in the
countries did not approve of the
regimes.

Cottam furthered his parallel,
comparing the two regimes .in

McDonel|

By WALTER WATSON

"I am always amazed,“ said
Terry McDonell, the managing
editor of Rolling Stone, "by the
number of people who query us,
and don't bother to look tip my
name, or anyone else‘s, for that
matter,‘ in the masthead of the
magazine.”

McDonell, who was hand picked
by Rolling Stone nearly I8 months
ago to change the format of the
magazine that boasts, "All the

as a writer, themyth surrounding
I{ollz'ng,Stone, and his upcoming
visit to the i982 University of Pitts-A
burgh Writers (lonference. in
which he will participate as part of
a panel discussion of how new wri-
ters can become published.

Mcl)onell said that although
guides to where freelance writers
can be published states that Rol-
ling Stone is almost entirely staff-
written. it is a false asstiinpt'on on
the part of the publishers o such
guides, iticluding The ll’. z'ter’.s‘
/llarket.

“We have only three staff writers.

I We actually solicit work from out-

side sources all the time. We’re
completely freelance written,"
McI)onell said. He added that Rol-
ling Stone never answers question-
naires sent out by publications like

Writers’ Conference Participants

"””‘Ste rn berg

By WALTER R. WATSON

Writer Janet Sternberg.
author of “The Writer and Her
Work,” remembers when she
first took writing seriously.

“When I was six years old,"
Stern berg recalled, “my parents

‘took me to see a movie called
Fantasia, and it was.the first

' time that I had ever had a sense

that there was another world, a

 world ofvart and music. I think
‘i’ that if I saw that movie again, I

probably would not like it at
all. But when I was six, I was
knocked on my ear by it. I came
home and just wrote my little
heart out.”

Stemberg works in New York

City as_ creative director of the

Manhattan Theatre Club and
program officer for the New
York Council for the Humani-
ties. Her work also appears in a
recently released anthology of
women writers entitled, “Ordi-
nary Women.” She will be
attending the sixth annual Pitt
Writers Conference, where she
Will participate on the “Women

 In Publishing" panel during

the conference.

“I was one of those awful
child poets who win prizes and
scliolarships—one of the schol-
arships in fact funded my
attendance to a women's col-
lege, which I went to for about a
year and a half. I then decided I
didn’t want to write. I got a
scholarship to be a writer——the
money was specifically ear-
marked for that-—and made
several‘ films for a number of
years. I returned to writing, ba-
sically, when I was SI or so,
because I wanted to reclaim
something that I had lost," said

u , V Sternberg.

Sternberg . has to her credit
over 70 documentary films, sev-
eral of which deal with writers,
many of them have been sold to

‘public television. " Originally _

from Boston, Sternberg received
a bachelor of arts degree from
the New School, the highly

V acclaimed New York-based arts

and communications institu-
tion. ' ‘s
As creative director of the
Manhattan Theatre Club since
1974, Sternberg has written and
produced several programs for

the organization's "Writers In

Performance” series. When
Sternberg took over the perfor-
mance series at the Manhattan
Theatre Club, the programs
were limited to a series of poetry
readings by noted poets.
There were two pt’()gr;uns
this season at the Manhattan
Theatre Club that Sternberg
found “very special." The first

was an opening night event.‘

“An Evening With Raymond
Chandler." in which actors
john Houseman, and Darren

MFGEIVUL and writer john‘

McShane gave theatrical. read-

-ings of the author's work.

McShane is credited with hav-
ing co-written the program
with Sternberg. The second

event was a reading last Mong

day night at MTC featuring
authors David McCullough
and Ring Lardner,i]r.

I very definately wanted to
expand the series to fiction, and
110“-flCU0n. as well as poetry,"
Sternberg said.

Sternberg sees advances,that

have come to women in pith-
lishing, cititig a “classic exam-
ple" from the 19th Century of
the difference between the pres-
ent and the past for women
writers.

“It’s a 19th Century example.
but a perfectly good one: Char-

lotte Bronte sent Jane Eyre to ’

the poet laureate of England
and asked for his comments.

and he just wrote back and said. ‘

‘Literature is not the business of
a woman's life. nor should it
be,’ and that was the end.
Right? The-door closed," she
said.

"The situation is changing
so much ‘now that the doors
aren’t closed in any absolute
way at all. In fact, all kinds of
wonderful things are getting
published. ’

“We wouldn’t ha-ve had this

explosion of the last 10 years, .

which has been across the
board--the_ small press, God
knows, and then things have
been picked up by coinmercial
publishers--if the doors weren’t

_ opening,” Sternberg said.

. “There are some more finely-
honed questions, perhaps, that
we can think about as a panel—-
there are questions like the cli-
mate of reviewing in this
country," she said.

. Steriiberg gave the example
of a recent review which
appeared in the New York
Times Review of Books. She
gives credit to the Times for
having printed the review of a
biography on the 20th Century
woman poet H.D. on page three
of that particular issue, yet she
holds out reservations for what
she sees as too much time given
by the reviewer to H.D.'s love
life, as opposed to the poet's life
work.

"Women are not necessarily ‘

penalized for being women
writers, per se. I think that’s

something that’s changing. -

But,'I think there is a certain
amount of occasional ‘ghettoiz-
ing’ that is going on. There is
resistance to small press work
being reviewed in the mass

-—Page .3

media. There are an awful lot of
women coming up through the
small presses; men as well, but
there is a door that’s cIosed,”
Sternberg said.

As another example of the
advances for women in publish-
ing, Sternberg said that the edi-
tor of her book, The W-rz’terAnd
Her Work, Carol Hauck Smith,
of W.W. Norton, Incorporated,
was ‘made a vice president at
Norton during‘ the time that
Sternberg’s work was edited.

Smith, who may attend the
conference as well, said of

Sternberg, “Janet is a woman '

with a high standard of excel-
lence. Work on the book with
her was a gratifying experience.
I. found her extremely pleasant
to work with. She is a woman of
intelligence, and sensitivity.
She was not onlyiinterested in
the editorial content, but the
design. She was able to work
with so many different people.
She is very multi-talented. In
editing these a'rticles,,,she _was

Reed‘
Resigns

By DIANE SCIULLO
The Progressive Student Net-

sive enough for some.
Dana Reed, the group’s
former co-executive chairman,
-told the PSN it is being “infil-
trated and used” by the Student
Government Board before he
resigned at a meeting
Thursday.

While Reed declined to com-
ment on that statement after the
meeting, other students had
plenty to say.

“I or no one else knows what

that statement means,” SGB
member Chip Roth said.
According to Roth, Reed had
disrupted an SGB planning ses-
sion on Wednesday night. The
session was held, in part, to dis-
cuss forming a task force com-
prised of several student
groups, including the PSN, to
fight federal budget cuts.

Kevin Danyi, PSN co-
executive chairman, said he
considered Reed's resignation
to be in the best interests of his
organization.

“He acted in a manner which
was disruptive, disrespectful
and totally unrepresentative of
any of the involved groups,"
Danyi said.

terms of their ability to continue in
power.

Both regimes, he said, had to rely
on heavy coercion, which included
two fors: (1) internal terror
instruments in each country, and
(2) belief by the people that, should
the regime be in trouble, the “men-
tors” would keep it in power.

Another method of keeping the
regimes in power, Cottam said, was
“through the minimal satisfaction
of material desires of the people,"
with both Poland and Iran being
excellent examples.

(Zottam then suggested that per-

_ haps a closer parallel to Iran is El

Salvador. He believes that the View

ot the Salvadoran people is that
U.S. imperialism in their country
is no less than Soviet involvement
in Eastern Europe.

Also, he suggested that the peo-
ple who are fighting for the regime
in El Salvador view themselves as
“fighting an anti-imperialist
battle."

“The parallel ends because of
geopolitics,” he said, pointing out
the Soviet Union borders
Poland while the United States is
thousands of miles from Iran and
El Salvador.

Referring again to Iran, (‘.ottam
said, “Psychologically, this was
good for us because we didn't ever
understand that the Iranians saw

_US as the Poles see the Soviets."

PittProgram Council:
Offering Films From

Ben Hur tostripes

By NATALIE FRIEDMAN

It takes more than just a vali-
dated ID card to bring a film to
David Lawrence Auditorium.

In fact, providing campus
film entertainment actually
requires considerable amounts
of time and money, as well as a

can be viewed a number of days
throughout the week.

The Wednesday night series
this term features film block-
busters, while the weekend ser-
ies present current films. The
Sunday double features are usu-
ally older films with a particu-
lar theme, or films which

Pitt Program Council Film
Committee, is responsible for
“providing a well-rounded
schedule of films for the univer-
sity community,” said Jimmy
Gilliland, PPC Program
Coordinator.

Located in the Schenley Hall
VPPC office, the 25 member Film

Committee offers everything
from Ben Hur to The Last

Tango in Paris. The films,

feature the same actor or acu ess,
Gilliland said. 

In addition, three times dur-
ing the term the committee
shows special presentations on
Thursday nights. For instance,
last month the committee pre-
sented a Clint Eastwood film
festival, he added.

The Sunday double feature is
a new addition to the Film
Committee’s program, said
Frank Perrotta, the committee
chairperson. “Next term we’ll

show the Academy Awards’ best H

pictures from I979 on down,"
he said.

In the past. the Film Com-
mittee was divided into two
separate cornmittees: foreign
films and contemporary fllms.
Last year, (lillilancl said, they
merged into one.

According to Perrotta, the
committee basically works with
four film companies: United
Artists, Films Inc., Swank, and
(Iinema Five. The companies
send the Film Committee their
catalogs to review the films they

offer, and the committee works
from there. The films are
chosen through a voting proce-
dure within the committee.

Most feature films cost
between $400 and $900.

“If we profit more than the
actual cost of the film, we have
to pay the film company 50 to
60 percent of our earnings."
Perrotta said.

The Film Committee is given
a $7,000 budget to work with,
and this term, Perrotta said, it
has exceeded its costs by
almost $3,000 in profits. This
money will go into the Pitt Pro-
gram Council general fund.

said. are the very comniercial

depends a lot on. the weather.
For instance, a warm Sunday
afternoon will not attract a
large audience to our double
feature,” he said.

The committee enjoyed suc-

of Life of Brian. However, Per-
rotta can recall incidents like
the screening of The Great San-
tini which drew _a very small
attendance because of its airing
on television the same week.

L./1. folded after about six
months, because of a story that was
printed in the paper claiming to
know the whereabouts of D.B.
Cooper, the robber who myste-
riously disappeared back around
the time. ' A 

“It was something between the S
editor, Carl Fleming and the writ-
er, who saidthat they had made
contact with people where Cooper.
was, to be found. The F.B.I. and
others checked it out, and found it
to be a hoax. That was the end of
LA.” McDonell’ said. ‘

After ,L.A., McDonell worked
with a then Rolling Stone owned
West coast magazine called 0ut- .
side, which he claimed was a “radi-
cal recreation” magazine that
combined political with environ-
mental concerns———the outside.

Outside was supposed to serve as
the proper foil that had never
existed for writerslike ErnestHem- ‘~ ._
ingway to express mari’s tie to‘
naturethrough a greater under-
standing of his surroundings. Fic-
tion was published along with e
non—fiction pieces, juxtaposed by
their subjects as a “heady mix,” of

- writingfrom ‘outside the main-
stream. As

editor of Outside,
McDonell says that he doesn’t,
“know if it worked or not, but that
was what it was supposed to be.”

The Hearstecorporation bought
Outside in 1976, renaming the
publication, Outside Mariah. By
this time, McDonnell had moved
on to purchase a ranch in Mon-
tana, where he wrote his first novel,
California Bloodstock.

It took nearly four years to sell.
During the interim, according to,,.‘;’
McDonnell, he started, the Colo-
rado publication, ~Rocky Moun-
tain, which he edited until he_was
hired in November 1980-to help
reshape Rolling Stone.

California Bloodstock is a turn-
of-the-Century look at ‘.‘th€ truth
about the invention of California.”
Author Tom . Robbin said of
McDonell’s first novel: “California
Bloodstock is an oyster of a book,
salty and delicious; a _ pearl-
handled, silverbarreled dérringer
of a book, small, elegant and snap-
py...I was sickened, delighted and
very impressed.’e' , _

McDonell cited his work with
the novel as having one of the wor
experiences of his writing career.

“Before the book was sold, I was
told that no one was buying west-
erns anymore, and then later that
westerns were back yin-all the
while, my novel wasn’t a western at
all. When I came to Rolling Stone
in Novemberlof 1980, MacMillan
bought it. That was almost four
years after I had written it,” McDo-
nell said. _ ,

“Jann Wenner -called me up at
Rocky Mountain and offered me
the job,” said McDonell, who is

" still working new ideas into the

design and‘ content of the maga-
zine. He remembers fi_rst publish-
ing fiction in Rolling Stone
against the wishes of publisher - 

Wenner. - -

  The ‘Pla

Before continuing any'further in their colossal fuss over
historic designations and proposed hotel-and-
condominium complexes in their backyard, the residents

_ of the._Schenley Farms neighborhood might want to go
back to their files and pull out a copy of The Oakland
Plan. The Plan is a study, researched and written by many
of their associates, that tends to go the opposite way on
many of their arguments against the proposed complex.

The Oakland Plan, conducted from 1977-1979, contains
some recommendations that propose, among other
things, that the very area behind the Syria Mosque and
Masonic Temple where the proposed complex is to be
located should be used for just such a purpose. Realizing
that Oakland was going to need a new hotel sooner or
later, the drafters of The Oakland Plan also recommended
a hotel and conference center for such hotly contested areas
as the Forbes-Sennot-Bouquet-Oakland “Two Block
“Area” and the Forbes-Fifth-Halket-McKee block area.

W This suggests alternate choices: Either the groups most
vocal in the fights for historic designation and against the

hotel complex never saw the plan, or they have seen it but '
have somehow dismissed it on the grounds that it might -

open some nasty holes in their argument.

Coordinated by Oakland Directions ln,c.(()DI), an
umbrella group composed of almost every organization in
the Oakland area, The Oakland Plan was, in its own

words, “the first serious attempt to get all interests into a A

planning process together in a climate of mutual determi-

nation todiscuss the difficult problems and conflicting

issues comprehensively and to arrive at agreed goals and
I strategies for dealing with them.”

By any account, the plan is perhaps the most compre-
hensive and ambitious attempt at focusing upon the prob-
lem of institutional development versus residential
concerns. It deals with such controversial issues as park-
‘ing, neighborhood and commercial revitalization, and
expansion of the universities and hospitals in the Oakland
area. - ’ - i

The key point to remember about the plan, however, is
that it resulted from a consensus of all the organizations in
Oakland, including ODI, Pitt, the city, the University

Health Center and the Chamber of Commerce. This A

means, simply, that any recommendations found in the
plan were approved by a majority of all those
organizations. I ‘ -

We do not raise this issue as a means of destroying the
credibility of the Schenley Farms Civic Association.iAs .a
matter of fact, if anyone has made an issue of the hotel
complex story, it’s been The Pitt ‘News. Rather, we raise
the issue as a way’ of remindingthe Schenley Farms people
that no matter how vocal they have been or become, they
are going to have to realize that while they surely should
have some influence inthe project, a hotel is going to have

to be built in Oakland sometime and it may just’ end up

near their neighborhood.

Directly involved in this conflict is the attempt to get
certain locations in Oakland designated as historic dis-
tricts. The Historic Review Commission(HRC), responsi-

. ble for monitoring and approving development in such

areas, heard further discussion on the issue Friday. Joan
Ivey,-chairman of the HRC board, said that although the
commission didn't arrive at any concrete decision on the
matter and probably won’t until ‘April, much of the con-

flict arises from some "misinformation which has been

circulating onboth sides. This, it seems, is the same prob-
lem that seems to affect every conflict regarding develop-
ment in the Oakland area. . '
Should the historic designation be approved for the

location in which the hotel would be located, the residents,
would have some influence in its development. This
would‘ be the best thing that could happen for both sides:
The developer could build his hotel, the residents could
have some say in it, and the fundamental principles of The
Oakland Plan would remain intact and progress as

Dear Editor:

It seems that once again The Pitt
News has gone ahead and run an
opinion column that is based on
incorrect information. It is obvious
that your writers cannot be taking
their solemn and powerful “posi-
tion seriously. I am referring to
Scott Rex’s Mar. 1 -column
(“Motives in Reunifying Ger-

many”). He stated that the Rapallo «

Treaty rearmed Germany with the-
Soviet’s aid. This is untrue. The

Treaty of Rapallo was signed on‘

Easter Sunday, 1922, and it was a
treaty negotiated during the Genoa
Conference on the problem of war
debts of Germany.

It was negotiated in secret, but it ‘

was announced publicly on the day

I , it was signed. The treaty declared

the resumption of full diplomatic
relations between Germany and
Russia, it cancelled the war debts
owed to each country by the other
and it gave‘ most-favored nation
treatment to both, but that was all.
It did not involve any military
negotiations. The error Rex made
isglaring and only reinforces what
I discussed in an earlier letter (Feb.
22), a lack of shown concern for
journalistic responsibility by The
Pitt News. Now I know it is diffi-
cult to put out a newspaper, but it
would only take a few minutes to
check something as simple as the
Treaty of Rapallo. If there is some
doubt as to the accuracyof a state-
ment, simply do not run the story. I
believe this is the policy of most
newspapers.

The treaty or negotiations Rex

Dear Editor;

In his reply to Tim -Kearney’s
column, of Feb. 17, Bruce C. Riley
(“America’s future Sun/{vat
Dependent on Strong Military,”

. Letter to the Editor, Feb. 24) fairly

characterizes national security
issues and international geo-
politics as if it were a scenario from

‘Star Wars. Perhaps Riley really

believes another Hollywood
anachronism, President Reagan, as
be continually rewrites history and
fantasizes dialectical ‘materialism
under every bed. Riley seems to per-
ceive the world in clearly defined
categories of good and evil. Such
tortured analysis only exacerbates
the kind of intelligent discussion

necessary in the campus
community.
Whether Riley addresses his

beliefs regarding El Salvador, per-
ceptions of the draft or what he
learned from Vietnam, he consis-
tently fails to appreciate the com-
plexities and horrors ofa world
populated by people whose dreams
and guts are torn daily by the blasts
of narrow ideological pre-
suinptions.

Riley declares “...that for every

refers to concerning the rearma-
ment of both the Germans and the

. Soviets was negotiated during this

time (1921), but it was not made
public, for if it had, it wouldghaye,
been a violation of the Treaty of
Versailles. The treaty called for the
Germans to secretly build arma-
ments factories in the Soviet
Union. ‘ Fromithis both countries
would benefit; the Germans would
receive armaments and the Soviets
could begin part of their rapid
industrialization, gain badly
needed technology and begin to
train the.Red Army. This treaty
was negotiated independently
from Rapallo by the respective mil-
itary establishments of both coun-
tries. It was not until late 1921 that

. any civilian members_ of the Ger-

\

man cabinet knew of the negotia-
tions and even then it remained in
secrecy. .

The idea of German reunifica-
tion put forth by Rex is not a new
one. It is old (dating back to World
War II itself) but it is still interest-
ing, though I feel far-fetched. I
believe as Rex does_ that the Soviet
leaders would insist onia reunified
Germany bordering on Poland be
communist. But the US. would
not allow a communist Germany.
It would seem to prefer one based
on some form of democracy possi-
bly similar to what exists in the
F RG now. So the situation is stale-
mated. And until. policy-making
orientation changes drastically
within both or one of the super-
powers, it probably will remain a
divided Germany. If “Rex is sug-
gesting that the Soviet-West Euro-

Reply:‘JingoisticOverkill’,

dollar that goes to helping some-
one in need, 50 cents probably goes
to abusing the system.” Apparently
this preposterous and unsub-
stantiated assertion is offered as a
rationalization for spending
increased dollars for military
buildup, vis-a-vis cutting human
service funding. He further arro-
gantly and condescendingly says
that, “...When people in poor

countries embrace Marxist ideolo-
gies, they are simply grasping at
straws.” I would submit that poor
people from any country are com-
pelled to grasp for the necessites of
life and for the alternative political
mechanisms by which to live with
dignity. Ideologies are fundamen-
tally meaingless. One cannot eat or
love an ideology, or for that matter,
an MX missile.

In response to Kearney's article,
an analysis not entirely to my lik-
ing either, Riley seems inclined to
jingoistic overkill and patriotic
paranoia. Perhaps he’s been watch-
ing too many war inovies.

pean gas pipeline is an inducement
to unify Germany, I must offer my
differing belief. Instead, this action
may be an attempt by the Soviet
leaders to lure the West Europeans
and especially the FRG to assume a
neutral or balancer role. This idea
in itself may not be a bad one. If the

‘ ,FRG would strictly play a balancer

role, no inclusion in NATO or the V
WTO, a balanced equal economic

role (as equal as is possible), then ._

the possibility of lessoning the ten-
sion, i.e. the arms race, exists. The
Germans could act as a mediator in
trying to bring the two superpow-
ers together to form some sort of
detente. This sounds like arational

explanation or guessas to what the . is

Soviet leaders may be trying to
accomplish. The Soviet leaders
realize German -reunification is
really old rhetoric and not a reality,
at least not in the foreseeable
future. If only the U.S. leaders
could think of the Soviet leaders as
more rational thinkers and not as
somehuge, unmanageable, mono-
litic bear trying to gobble up the
world with everymove.

(Note) I do realize the negative
nature of communism and its hor-
rible toll on human life. Democra-
cies should not accept communism
as a way of life for some with no

hope for breaking away. They A

Dear Editor: .

I wouldlike to clarify two points
in your “Retention Committee
Study" article (The Pitt News,
Mar. 5). Our recent drop-out tele-
thons were simply a pilot effort
intended to teach us how such
things would work. If this consti-
tuted “research,” it was in that
sense and not inthe sense that we
were seeking to make claims about
the characteristics of our drop-
outs. Secondly, meaningful data
on the numbers of drop-outs is
quite sketchy, and the 3,500-4,00 _.

Heading West for NCAA’s

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

All year long they had raked up
victories by running teams into the
ground. They would lure teams
into their style of run-and-gun bas-
ketball by pressing hard, making
teams play a step or two faster than
they were capable of playing.

They were ninth-ranked, their
leather-lunged fans followed them
religiously and the team owned the
Eastern 8. Not that they were invin-

cible, it’s just that no one beat‘

them. The West Virginia Moun-
taineers won, and won and won.

That is, until they encountered
an angry Pitt team. A Pitt team that
beat them 79-72.

Their record going into the
fipals of the Eastern 8. champion-
ship was a gaudy 26-2. And they
talked cockily. “I feel sorry for
whoever wins the Pitt-Rutgers
game,” star guard Greg Jones said
after the Mountaineers had run
over, what else?-——St. Bonaventure,
76-65, in Friday night’s semifinal
game.-,

WVU seemed to get caught up in
their own success. Heads swelled.
With their legion of boisterousfans
and theirlown play, no one could

beat them. And oh, how the words

kept flying.

“Who are they to dictate to me?
They’re nothing but a mediocre
program, right?” Mountaineer
coach Gale Catlett’s words after a
narrow win over Pitt two weeks
ago turned an already st.eamy
rivalry into an outright feud.

Then there was the incompre-
hensible shunning of Pitt’s Clyde
Vaughan. The coaches of the East-
ern 8 voted that. the league’s lead-
ing scorer and third leading
rebounder was not good enough to
be among the top five players in the
league,

At least Vaughan made second
team. Pitt’s point guard Dwayne

\

 

   

-

Wallace, far and away the leading
assist man in the league, was
nowhere to be found on either
team.

All of this gently simmered in
the Pitt players minds—just wait-
ing to get even with the Mountain-2
eers. lrked is the word.

"“We want to play West Virginia.
That’s our goal. We want them
again,” Boo Kirby said after Pitt’s
narrow first-round victory over
Duquesne on Tuesday.

But first, a tall, talented and
menacing Rutgers team awaited. A
Rutgers team that had done what
the Panthers so desperately wanted

So much was expected of
Clyde Vaughan. He didn’t help

He was overweight.

But, oh! How he could shoot.

Against James Madison, he
scored 29 points; against

Duquesne, his bombs kept Pitt .

from getting blown out. He
scored 21 points against Dela-
ware Slaw’.

And yet, there was criticism.

Sure, they said, he could kill a
zone, but go man—to-man, and
he’s ineffective. He was 6-4. He
was slow. He couldn’t dribble.

the Civic Arena. Wallace was the second-leading scorer in the game with 20 points.

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

It was a lesson in perspective
when Panther point guard Dwayne
Wallace stepped to the microphone
Saturday night, a newly-acquired
basketball net slung around his
neck as a symbol of Pitt’s 79-70
Eastern 8 title conquest of No. 9
West Virginia.

For when the senior co-captain
and game star began his address to
the news media and talked about
the biggest victory of the season for
him, he wasn’t. referring to the bas-
ketball game which had concluded
just minutes earlier. ’

Blinking in the hot white glare
of the television lights, Wallace
alluded rather to the ups and

     

   

downs, motivations and pain that
characterized his final collegiate
season—-even ravaged it for
awhile—-—before ending in a way he
would term, ‘fa tribute to me to be
able to pull through it all. ’

“During one bad stretch, when I
was falling apart, the players held
me together—-the coaches too. I
wanted to give 150 percent. on the
court, not only for my family, but
for my father who died Dec. 4,”
Wallace said. “I dedicated this sea-
son tomv father.”

Wesley Wallace, career military
man, Baltimore city worker and
father of 11 children, died after a
lengthy battle with tuberculosis,
almost three months ago to the day
when his son ap eared in the East-

em 8 semifinal round Friday and
put some finishing touches on a
season dedicated to the man that
reared him.

As Dwayne said, “I’m thinking
about him when I’m out there on
the court. Besides my wife and son,
he was my biggest fan. It affected
me in a lot of ways.”

These are some of the ways.

’X= =X= =ll=

After pulling out of his season
trials both on and off the court. to
help lead Pitt to a'l‘_’-3 record in its
‘ast 15 games, Dwayne Wallace fin-
ished the regular season leading
the Eastern 8 in assists and, to head
coach Roy Chipman’s voiced dis-
may if not his own, was not among
the 10. players named to the
coaches’ all—league team.

On the court, the 6-3 senior
responded with 34 points, 15 assists
and six steals during the Panthers’
semifinal and final tournament
wins, two perfcirmances that Chip-
man used as the cornerstone to
build his case for calling Wallace,
“one of the best point guards in the
Eastern 8, if not the entire East.

“As far as.l’m concerned, Wal-
lace was slighted as much  Clyde
(Vaughan) was slighted,” Chip-
man said of the voting which some
league observers said was adversely
influenced by Pitt"s decision tojoin
the Big East next season. “It’s just
not understandable to keep him off
the all-star team.”

Given his chance to respond to
the oversight. Wallace passed on
the opportunity to vent his dismay
about the all-league team or the
West Virginia players’ and coach’s
degrading pre-game remarks about
Pitt.

“If people think Greg Jones is a
better guard than me, let them
think that," Wallace said. “I really
don't want to get into it. It's just a
ballgame. We come from different
towns or whatever, but we're all
human. Whatever someone says,
no matter what, it’s still just a
ballgame.”

Men Swimmers Finish Secondat Easterns

C5,: SEAN BARNES

The 1982 Men's NCAA Eastern
Regional Swimming and Diving
Championships concluded Satur-
day night at Trees Hall Pool with
West Virginia in first, defending
champion Pitt in second, Penn
State third and Maryland fourth.

The three-day meet qualified 11
Eastern swimmers and divers for
the NCAA Division I Nationals at
the end of March. Seven national-
ists were Panthers, while the other
four were one swimmer each from
Penn State, West Virginia, Mary-

oland and North Carolina.

A The final Eastern scores, WVU-
862.5, Pitt-661.5, Penn‘ State-538
and Maryland-535, can be largely
attributed to a function of team
’ depth, as Pitt had placed a
swimmer over West Virginia in 12
of 18 events; yet, due to the top 18
place finishes getting team points,
West Virginiatook the title.
Leading the East in individual
Nationafquafifications with three
was Pitt freshman Ed Bergan, who
was awarded the Most Outstanding-
Swimmer of the meet. Bergan goes
to Milwaukee in Pitt’s 400-yard
medley relay, and individually in
the 100-and 200-yard backstroke

‘L/dents. “All his swims were out-

nding,” said Pitt head coach
Fred Lewis. “His 100-yard back-
stroke time would have been All-
American'(a top 12 time) at last
year’s Nationals. I’m looking for-
ward to«even better-than-usual
times at Nationals because Ed is a
freshman. Like the other freshman,
this wasitheir first three-day meet
where they had to do four or five
swims a day, when you count pre-
lims in the afternoon. Even with a
National cut on the third day, I
could see he was a little tired. This
will be different at Nationals.”

Coach Lewis was pleased with
his entire team‘which established
five of the meet’s 12 new Eastern
records set in the 18 events.

bu“ Both Lewis and_ senior Sandy

Pidgeon were disappointed, how-
ever, in Pidgeon’s loss to Mary-
land’s Kirk Sanocki in the 200-yard

‘breastroke, but Pidgeon’s’ record-

setting performance in the 400-’

’ yard individual medley had to be

_ hurting to him on Saturday.

“Sanocki swam two 100-yard
breastrokes Friday,” said Lewis.
“Sandy did four times that in
swimming the 400 individual med-
ley (I.M.) in prelirns and finals. But

Sandy still outswam Kirk. It was

the turns where Sandy seemed to be
arched too much and seemed to

‘ drag.” E

Pidgeon will still be going to

d medley relay team. . '
‘Senior Rick Carter, will anchor
two relays for Pitt at Nationals. At

- Easterns, he anchored both Pitt’s

400-yard medley and freestyle

tionals as part of the Pitt 400-_ A

relays to victory. It was a very
happy Carter who drove intothe
finish of the _freestyle relay in the
* meet’s last event.

The same Pitt relay; with three of
the same swimmers, had just
missed National qualification last
year by one one-hundredth of a
second. Their time of 3:01.99 this
year, which qualified them by two-
hundredths of a second, was very
gratifying. Carter went on to win
the 100-and 200-yard freestyle,
while placing third in the 50-yard
freestyle and second as a member of
Pitt’s 800-yard freestyle relay. '

“All we needed in the meet was a
few more bodies,” said Lewis. “If
you take our times versus West Vir-
ginia’s on a dual meet basis, we
won 62-51. It was depth alone that
caused us to lose. With good
recruiting; we can definitely come
back next season.”

But it will have to be an extra
good recruiting job by Lewis and
his swimmers for next year as Pitt
will lose seniors Pidgeon, Carter,
and Greg Pelton. All three are
highly respected throughout the
East. Carter is a four-time NCAA
qualil'ier'and"Pidgeon has quali-
fied three times. —~

Both Carter and Pidgeon are

I greatly anticipating their last
NCAAs and Lewis has been tram-5

ing them especially fo this meet.
“They both still have a goodbit

of tapering left in them,” said

Lewis. f‘We’ll start out this week

with the usual tough background I

practices, and move into quality
sprinting next week.”

Lewis’ reasons to be pleased
helped outweigh Pitt’s overall
second-place finish—the first time
in seven years tha_t_t_he Panthers
have not won the Eastern title. .

Underclassmen J.D. McCrillis,
Ed LaNoue, Tim -Brewer, Doug
Condon, Randy Falck, Greg
Murphy, Geoff Emore and Jerry
Zaleski all_had season’s best times
as they scored valuable points for
Pitt. Some, such as -LaNoue, were
even nationalists this ‘year.

Pitt’s national-qualityiing events
started with the 400-yard medley
relay of Bergan, Pidgeon, Emore
and Carter. Emore was’ fantastic at
Easterns, dropping ‘his season’s
best time by morethan two full
seconds. According to Lewis, how-
ever, the whole relay has the ability
to cut more time, as tapering
continues. A

The meet’s last event, the 400-
yard freestyle relay, really showed

Lady Swimmers Second Best  

By scorr DELLETT

When a swim team wins*l0 of 24
events, and breaks nine school
records in the process, the team
should have little problem win-
ning any meet. '

Oddly enough. such was not the
case for the Pitt Lady Panther swim
team team as it finished second for
the third consecutive year at trre
AIAW Eastern Regionali.Cha'm-
pionships this weekend at Har-
vard. Princeton,
champion, outpointed Pitt 855.5 to
635.

In fact, the Lady Panthers had to
win their final event, the 400-yard
freestyle relay, to snare second
place ahead of Penn State, a team
Pitt defeated, handily in the dual
meet season. I _ '

With all their outstanding per-
formances, why did’ the Lady
Panthers have to struggle just to

the defending,

finish second? As Pitt Coach Dave
Belowich correctly predicted before
the meet, it was the team’s lack of
depth that prevented a title victory.

“Both Princeton and Penn State
had 20 swimmers,” Belowich said.
“Penn State won only two events
and yet were only ll points behind
us. We had to overcome these
numbers. We didn’t with

Princeton."
I Belowic-hi said he would've.

needed even more outstanding per-

formances by his swimmers to‘

overtake Princeton. Several Pitt
swimmers’ put on a showing
unparalleled by the other competi-
tors" in the_th‘ree-day meet which
began Thursday.

. Senior Amy Jackson and junior
Jan Ujevich each had what ranked
among best performances. Jackson
set school and meet records and

. qualified for the AIAW National

Championships later this month

in the 50- and 100-yard butterfly, in
25.38 and 53.67. seconds respec-
tively. Jackson also won the 100-
yard freestyle to qualify again for

"nationals with a time of 51.1.

The three-time All America also
finished second in the 200-yard

freestyle (1252.52) and third in the

200-yard butterfly (2:06.68).

Ujevich also set a school record
and qualified for nationals in the
200-yard _ individual medley
(2:07.33). The two-time All Amer-
ica won .three other events—-the.50-
yard freestyle, 100-yard ‘breast-
stroke, and successfully defended
her Eastern title in the 100-yard
i_n_dividual medley. ‘ «

Ujevich combfriéd with Jackson,
Julie Terrell and Nancy Henry to
break a Pitt and Easternmark in
the 400-yard ‘freestylerelay which

[That was a year ago. Clyde
Vaughan hears these things no
more. He’s lost 20 pounds. He's
begun to handle the ball a little
more. He’s led his team in scor-
ing with an 18.0 points game
average, tops in the Eastern 8.
He's the third-leading
rebounder in the league. He’s
the Outstanding Player of the
Eastern 8 tournament.

“I worked very hard in the
off-season. I lost 20 pounds. I
worked out, put on some mus-
cle. I just imp_roved my all-
around game,"Vaughan said
after garnering the Eastern 8
tournament’s MVP award for
his two-game, 42-point, 23
rebound performance.

Improve? Did he ever. At
times. the sophomore was
dominating. . .

Pitt is playing Rutgers in the

. semi-finals of the Eastern 8

tournament. Vaughan has
missed his first shot of the even-
ing. He has the ball 25 feet from

the basket. He squares his
shoulders, shoots and hits. He
hits four more attempts from
outside.
Then, the 6-4 forward goes
up against Roy Hinson, the
Scarlet Knight’s dominating 6-
9 center. A ferocious inside
player, Vaughan lays it in over
iHinson and draws the foul.
Three-point play. Rutgers is on
its way back to New jersey. . .
It’s not the shooting that
impresses so much. There will
always be great shooters. It’s his

rebounding. Despite his lack of ’

height, Vaughan has the knack
of anticipating bounces off the:
rim. It seems he’s always there,
-just a step ahead of bigger play-
ers, to pull down rebounds,
and, oh the positioning he gets.
“You have to wantthe ball. I
want it and go after it. Nobody
on that court is going to get the
ball from me,” Vaughan says.
But even the impressive sta-
tistics didn’t sway Eastern 8

Gymnasts Travel to WVU  

By MIKE ROSE I

The Pitt Panther mens’ gymnas-
tics team returns to West Virginia
today to face'West Virginia and a
much tougher team, the University
of Illinois. 

Illinois is ranked 13th in the
country and their scores have been
averaging around 270. com pared to
Pitt’s 254 scoring average. Pitt is
going to have to reach out for a
little bit extra and Panther Coach
Frank D’Amico knows it.

“We are working harder for this
meet than we have for any other
meet this year,” D’Amico said.

According to I)’Aiiiico, Illinois
is not quite as good as Penn State.

Pitt’s next opponent, but they are
still an excellent team. DfAmico
purposely scheduled a. good team
so it would prepare his team better
for Penn State,whiCh will be the
Panthers’ last dual meet of the
season.

D-’Amico is hoping his team can
score somewhere between 265-267
total points.

"We are working a lot harder to 0

get two-tenths more scoring per
person. If we can accomplish this.
it will give us a six- or seven-point
increase in our team total,”
D’Amico explained.

He also plans to (tliaiige the order
in which his gymnasts compete in
hopes of gaining a few extra

points.

"in the side horse, I am going to

The PittNews, Monday, March L8,! 

Wallace’s Season

continued from page ten

assistant coach Reggie Warford,
“but no matter how bad he felt, he
wasn't going to rub it in their faces
last night, even when he could
have.”

Wallace know there are different

kinds of games.
i if If

Coming off his finest of three
previous college seasons, Dwayne
Wallace approached his senior year
and co-captain duties seriously,
full of high expectations and the

'€§.ppe of playing well enough to be

chosen in the NBA June draft.

Toward that end, Wallace real-
ized early on that to get the scout’s
notice playing for a team that
started three players in their first
year of major college basketball
would require not only that he play
well, but that the whole team
played well. As co-captain, Wal-
lace wanted to lead the way.

“Dwayne came into the season

with high hopes for a possible pro
career. With the young people
around us, he knew there was no
guarantee of us getting into the
NCAA tournament again and get-
ting the exposure that is so impor-

t," Warford said. “He knew that
if he had anything to look forward
to personally, the team also had to
have a good year.”

After Pitt's 8-6 start characterized
by inconsistency, Dwayne Wallace
was struggling with the burden of
his father's death, the responsibili-
ties of being a student-athlete with
a child and expectant wife, and the
self-imposed pressure of leading a
youth-laden team that appeared it
would lose as many as it would
manage to win.

“It seemed for a while that all his

hopes and aspirations were out the
window," Warford said. “But, you

get a chance to see a person's char-*

acter when he faces adversity.”

¢WOver the last half of the season,
allace emerged as Pitt's floor

general, team leader and patriarch,
protector and confidante, taking
charge and usually controlling a
group of often-tempermental
teammates.

The results? The 8-6 start aside,

the Panthers reeled o_ff_l2 wins in

 

Jiragio, Rewarding

, l5itries—the last two wins coming
Friday and Saturday night as Wal- I

lace played his most inspired, most
complete games of the season.

“He hasn't been as worried
about some of the things going on
around him,” one team offical
said. “It’s helped that he has a taiii-‘
ily of his own. He likes to be leaned
on. He was trying to be strong and
trying to be an example for his fam-
ily as well. It's forced him to grow
up a little quicker.”

“Dwayne is like a father on the
court,” _ said Panther freshman‘
George Allen. “He calms us down,‘
gets us back into the game, tells us
what we're doing wrong.”

“I'm dedicated not only to my
father, but to my players too," Wal-
lace said Saturday night after the
game. “The players
together during my bad stretch. I
still think about that.

“But, when you have a big test,
the question is whether we want it
or are we gonna lay down and die."

Obviously, Wallace believes in
leading by example.

It II II

Wallace, reflecting back on the
past. year, says being a student and
athlete with a family has given him
“a*-‘little more dedication to get
things done." Besides the shot at a
pro career, Wallace lists his imme-
diate'.goals as finishing up his
degree in urban development in
June and taking care of his family.

At basketball practice last Wed-

nesday, Wallace was told he had a

phone call from his expectant wife.
As he left to drive Kim to the hospi-
tal, Wallace ran off the court yel-
ling, “It's a girl! It's a girl!” Later
that day, at Shadyside Hospital, the
doctors informed him that he had
gotten his wish. '

“He had wanted a baby girl in
the very worst way," laughed War-
ford. “I'm sure when he was driv-
ing his wife to the hospital, he
wasn't thinking of basketball. Bas-
ketball and other things seem a lit-
tle more trivial then."

# I C

“Why did I shave my head,”

Wallace repeated the reporter's

question and grinned. “Everyone 0

else was doingit and I thought it

Later, after some more reflec-
tion, Wallace added, “After I dedi-
rated my season to my father and
wasn't playing as well, Ishaved my

my biggest fan."

Later, away from the television

heaved a contented sigh as he
walked back toward the locker
room. “Thank God everything is
working out better now," he said.

“You look tired," someone

Gymnasts

Fall in
Florida

. By BRIAN BALK

in football the losing element is
turnovers, in track it is false starts,
but in the sport of gymnastics it is
falls. The falls that the Lady
Panther Gymnastic Team encoun-
tered last Saturday led to the team's
139.4-145.35 loss to the University
of Florida Gators.

According to the Lady Panther
head coach, Donna Sanft, Pitt
could have scored in the 140's had
there not been numerous falls from
the beam and uneven bars."

The Gators’ 145.35’ score-—
which ranked well above their
season average-—was accomplished
through almost flawless perform-
ances.

One of the finer performances of
the meet was displayed by Gator
Lynn McDonald, who captured
first place in the all-around with a
phenominal 36.95 score. McDon-
ald was followed by her team-
mate, former Elite"-class gymnast
Ann Woods, with a second place
score of 36.55.

- A highlight for the Lady Panth-
ers was the return of sophomore
All-America Lisa_ Shirk to the all-
around position. Although Shirk’s
appearance in the all-around was
marred by two falls, her high-cali-I
her performance still enabled her to
earn third—place with a score of
36.15.

With more practice time Shirk
should make her presence known
again this weekend at-the NCAA-
Eastern Regional championship

. hosted by Pitt.

Another fine performance was
turned in by senior Holly Martino.
Martino caputred fourth-place in
the all-around with an excellent

While the numbers game didn’t
help the Lady Panthers this week-
end, things should be different next
year when the NCAA will assume
sole control over women's colle-
giate swimming.

“The NCAA has an 18 swimmer
limit, with divers counting as half
a swimmer,” Belowich said. “This
should balance things out."

Despite the huge winning mar-
gin Princeton ran up, Belowich
was full of praise for his swimmers.

“The girls did a tremendous job,”
the first-year coach said. “They
made everyone know who Pitt was.
It was also a fitting way to end this
season and the seniors’ careers.”

Certainly they made an excellent

This past weekend was the end to
a hard season for the Panthers. Fin-
ishing 2-3 for the season is not a
typical Panther swim learn finish.
but sending seven swimmers to
Nationals, compared to two com-
petitors last year is a big accomp-
lishment for the Pitt swim team on
the National level.

The experienced Panthers
turned in times that not only kept V
them even with the increasingly
faster National cutoff times, but
that also moved them up the East-

ern ladder. For the freshman, it was .; ,

a big learning experience cappe 
with a bit of icing by the very fast
times they achieved.

Lewis said they have all looked
much harder at their seasonal
training and have assessed what
needs to be improved for next
season.

The seven Panthers who quali-
fied for NCAA Division I- Nation-‘
als will continue practicing until
the end of March. Nationals in Mil-

be shooting as a team to break the
