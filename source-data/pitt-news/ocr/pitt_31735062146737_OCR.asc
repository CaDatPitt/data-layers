This edition of the Pitt News has been issued by the Depart-
ment of Journalism with the cooperation of the Student Faculty
Association and a volunteer temporary staff of students. The
News will continue to be issued on this basis for the next three or
four weeks, pending the completion of plans and the organization
of a permanent staﬁ’ for the current year.

Part of the plan for the current year is the employment of

Mr. Machesney is a graduate of the College in the Class of 1932.
He was editor of the Pitt N-ews for two years as a junior and
senior. Since graduation he ha.s been a special investigator for the
Carnegie Hero Fund Commission with duties which required con-
stant travel throughout all parts of the United States. At present
he is ‘in Alaska and will not be able to assume his duties at the
University ‘until about October 1.

In order not to handicap Mr. Machesney in organizing the work,
it has been deemed advisable to delay the formation of the perma-
nent staff until he has had a ﬁrst-hand opportunity to acquaint
himself with the problems connected with his assignment.

Mr. Machesney plans to organize the student publications on
a basis that will make them as far as possibl-e_representative of
the whol-e student body and a credit to the students of the Uni-
versity, and also afford training to the students of the University
who are interested in reporting and writing for the publications.

The University bespeaks the desire of Mr. Machesney for the
cooperation of the student body through its Student Faculty Asso-
ciation and of those former staﬂ’ members of the publications
who wish to cooperate in an effort to accomplish the purpose

nounced this summer by the Uni-
versity.

ciation of Schools of Social Work,

.made effective this month.

of the University. It is an out-
growth of the University’s Divi-
sion of Social Work which has
been conducted for the last seven
years under Dr. Manuel C. Elmer,
p1‘0fessor and head of the depart-
ment of Sociology in the College.

Society requested classes for its
workers. The following year the
17 social agencies of Pittsburgh
joined in sponsoring additional
courses. ‘

In 1931, the Buhl Foundation
became interested in the project
and made a grant to help subsi-
dize the work. The Division of
Social Work received professional
ranking and a further grant
from the Buhl Foundation in
1934. Last January the Division
was admitted to full membership
in the Association of Schools of
Social Work.

FIRST ASSIGNMENT

Most editorials at the be-
ginning of the school year
are written for freshman.
This one, however, is for up-
perclassmen.

Much has been going on in
the University during your
vacation. Expansion, both
physical and curricular, has
taken place. You, as upper-
classmen, ,ought to be. par-
ticularly interested in these
things.

You will discover that a
new professional school has
been added to the Univer-
sity, the School of Applied
Social Sciences; and, organ-
ized to cooperate with the
department of ﬁne arts, a
department of ceramics has
been added to The College.
Four nationality rooms have
been completed since school
closed, the School of Engi-
neering has taken over State
Hall, and the old Mellon In-
stitute building has been re-
modeled for the School of
Medicine. A new gymna-
sium, to be used especially
by women and for profes-
sional courses in physical
education, is nearing com-
pletion in the basement of
the Cathedral of Learning,
leaving Trees gymnasium
available f o r intramural
sports exclusively.

These and many other evi-
dences of signiﬁcant prog-
ress are apparent through-
out the University.

Why don’t you upperc1ass-
men make it a point to ac-
quaint yourselves with the
University's recent advance-
ment and then tell the fresh-
men? You can do it much
better than an editorial.

FRESHMAN WOMEN

Gazing into the crystal,
the Great Spirite Mystique
sees a haze more mysterious
than she has ever seen be-
fore. She concentrates——the
vision is still obscure. Now
the haze is slowly clearing
and before her the Spirite
sees plainly something con-
cerning freshman women.
Ah! They are from Pitt. The
haze is lifting. A glamorous
glow is forming in the
depths of the crystal. It
grows brighter, brighter,
brighter until it surpasses
anything the Great Spirite
has ever seen. She hears
laughter and fun and gaiety;
and sees a group of women

tion.

But suddenly the glamour,
the fun, the gaiety are shad-
owed by a dark cloud of
warning. The Spirite Mys-
tique must not tell all the
facts. These will be unveiled
at Le Bal Mystique. For the
present the crystal will only
reveal a short message of in-
structions. Listen closely, my
Pitt freshmen. “The crystal
speaks! Dress in your gay-
est summer formals, being
sure you wear a small mask
before you come into the
Commons Room. Your eyes
must not betray all you see.
Be not late for the hour is
set at seven on the evening
of the twelfth day of Octo-
ber. The Spirite Mystique,
who will be made known at
Le Bal, has already beckoned
the Mentors to her side. She
has entrusted them with all
the knowledge permitted.
Seek them for guidance and
an evening of fun and frolic
and mystery is yours. The
crystal has spoken!”

 

‘Pen Pictures’

Off Presses

ohn W. Harpster
s Its Editor

f Publication of “Pen Pictures of
arly Western Pennsylvania,”

structor in history, was scheduled
by the University Press for Sep-
tember 29, Lawrence E. Irwin,
director of the Press said today.

The book, fourth in a series re-
lating Western Pennsylvania his-
tory, was written under the direc-
tion of the Western Pennsylva-
nia Historical Survey and spon-
sored jointly by the University,
the Buhl Foundation, and the
Historical Society of Western
Pennsylvania.

The compiler and editor, Mr.
Harpster, was a fellow with the
Western Pennsylvania Historical
Survey when the manuscript was
prepared, later served as curator
of the Historical Society of West-
ern Pennsylvania, and is now an
instructor in history at the Uni-
versity.

“Pen Pictures” is a collection
of the most colorful and informa-
tive writings left by early travel-
ers and settlers who ventured
west of the Allegheny mountains.
There are excerpts from 37 ac-
counts, including a French sol-
dier boy’s story of life at Fort
Duquesne; Christian Frederick
Post’s own account of his diplo-
matic mission to the French In-
dians; a Quaker trader’s day by
day record of life in the village of
Pittsburgh; and Captain Trent’s
journal of the siege of Fort Pitt
by Pontiac’s savages.

There are 340 pages in the
book, including a bibliography of
travel and description in Western
Pennsylvania from 1748 to 1830.
The book is illustrated with line
drawings by Harvey Cushman,
Pittsburgh artist, who has also
provided a decorative map for end
papers, as well as a reference
map showing roads and settle-
ments mentioned in the accounts.

New Y. W. Secretary

ls Traveler, Artist

A very much-traveled young woman with deﬁnite ideas for the
improvement of college life is the new executive secretary of the
Y. W. C. A. at the University this fall.

Miss Betty Farrow began her duties last week with the opening
of school. She will oversee most of the work and social life of ap-
proximately 300 young women very near her own age.

er is a native Pennsylvanian hav-
ing received much of her public
school education'in Reading and
Carlisle. She graduated from high
school at Shamokin, and also at-
tended Miss Sayward’s Prepara-
tory School and received her
bachelor of arts degree from
Elmira College.

From Elmira College, young, 

attractive Miss Farrow entered
Columbia University where she
took her master’s degree in re-
ligious education.

Art is the executive secretary’s

avocation. She studied that sub- 1

ject while touring Europe with
the American Institute of Educa-
tion for two months. Attending
classes in the mornings, she vis-
ited various famous museums and
galleries in the afternoons.

“College students of today are
realists,” says Miss Farrow. “A
few older persons in opposition to
college educations accuse colleges
of not including extensive courses

on religious life in their curricula.

They say students turn from the
church to other activities.

“These students will accept re- V

ligion enthusiastically if they see
good in it, even though they may
not call it religion. They are not
satisﬁed with nice s o u n d i n g
phrases, but must see ideas put
to action. This is, and should be,
the purposes of the Young Wom-
en’s and Men's Christian Asso-
ciations.”

Miss Farrow thinks the Y. W.
brings a democratic spirit to the
campus that might be_ lost in fra-
ternal associations. She would like
to improve relations between the

faculty and students, having them
meet on a more common basis. A
ﬁve-fold purpose of the associa-
tion is to sponsor high principles
of living, offer a Christian outlook

Miss Farrow served as a‘ coun-.j

associate secretary for the Pe

 Virginia Hopes to Crack
utlierland’ s Record of Wins

-The classmates who selected the nickname for “Sleepy” Glenn,
coach of the West Virginia Mountaineers, were guilty of gross ex-
aggeration. Glenn is by“no means asleep, nor are the Mountaineers,
f’who‘_ come here Saturday to open the 1938 ‘football season, and, as
they ﬁrmly believe, to start the season with a victory.

 And do not be fooled in classifying a West Virginia victory as an
upset. The Morgantown team was one of the best met by the Pan-
,ther last season. Nor have graduation, ineligibility, injury, ﬁre,
-water, or any ﬁckle fates changed the roster much since then. Glenn
will send the same team on the ﬁeld which put up one of the best
defensive games of the year last season against Pitt.

Runners Will
Do Lots Of

Traveling

The ﬁnest cross country sched-
ule in the history of Pitt athletics

only team to defeat Pitt last fall,
comes to Pittsburgh.

The big test will be the I.C.A.A.
A.A.,, championships at New York
over the Van Courtland Park
Course on November 14. The
season ends with another visit to
Lansing for the N.C.A.A.

The Pitt prospects, despite the
schedule, also are the brightest in
years.— Veterans returning from
1937 include Ben and Casmir
Kopec, Albert Zamborski, Bob
Cogeswell, and Allan McKee. In

- ‘addition there are Al Boulanger

Fox Named
First Assistant

Alec Fox, Pitt grid captain in
1928 and serving his second year
on Jock Sutherland’s staff, has
been named ﬁrst assistant coach,
succeeding Charles Bowser, whose
resignation was turned in last
winter.

Fox, one of Pitt's famous
watch-charm guards, was a. reg-
ular on the 1927 team, and in
1928 was captain. In that year
he went West with the All-East
team.

Following his graduation he
coached at Oil City, Pa., and then
at Martins Ferry, Ohio. The next
year he went to the University of
Pennsylvania as line coach for
Harvey Harman.

He remained at Penn until the
spring of 1937 when he rejoined
the staff at his alma mater, being
in charge of the tackles last year.

Fox is the ﬁfth man to hold the
post of ﬁrst lieutenant to Coach
Sutherland. Preceding him were
Guy Williamson; Charley Bowser,
who served from 1927 through
1929, and again in 1937; Andy
Gustafson; and Bill Kern,_ now
head coach at Carnegie Tech.

‘What Recession?’ June Grad,
Sales Promoter, Inquires

If this is a “recession,” then Robert F. Wiltman, a graduate of the
University in June, would like to know what prosperity is.

As a senior at Pitt, Wiltman organized a sales extension company,
Whlch is already an extremely prosperous concern.

Sales promotion, Wiltman says,<«‘

is “not simply a window display,
or a few advertisements, or a novel
publicity idea. It is an extremely
broad term, including any means
to retain sales, increase sales, or
lay the basis for future sales.”

Wiltman was a member of the
freshman football squad and a
member of Phi Kappa fraternity.
.He paid most of his expenses
through four years by working
part-time as a salesman.

He started his sales extension
company last December. So, with-
out a client or even a prospect, he
took L. B. Hollein in. as his part-
ner. It was not until about March
that he had his ﬁrst client. Since
then the client’s sales have tripled.
Another concern, one which sells
to the building industry, soon in-
tends to expand its production,
due to sales increases aided by
Wiltman.

Wiltman started his company
with $100 of borrowed capital. He
sold 24 different types of com-
modities and articles since gradu-
ating from Allegheny high school,
so knows something about the
sales project from the sa1esman’s
point of view.

Games Replace
Physical Ed

Starting this week, the new in-
tramural sports program, de-
signed to encourage wider par-
ticipation in athletics by men stu-
dents, will substitute participation
in intramural games for the for-
mer physical education require-
ment for credit.

The new program, approved by
the Board of Trustees following
recommendation by the Faculty
Committee on Athletic Policy last
spring, will be administered by
the Department of Athletics.

Behind the reorganization of
the intramural program is the in-
tention of securing for a larger
portion of the men students of
the University the beneﬁts de-
rived from participation in ath-
letics. Twenty-eight sports, con-
ducted under competent instruc-
tion and supervision, will be car-
ried on to interest the student in
taking part after his freshman
year.

Every effort will be made to
encourage students to continue
their activity beyond the ﬁrst
year by becoming members of
various teams, fraternity, school,
class, and the like, in their chosen
sports.

Freshmen will take ‘part in at
least two sports of their own
choice with the interest and time
given checked and constituted as
fulﬁllment of the physical educa-
tion requirement for undergradu-
ate courses.

There will be conducted also a
special corrective class for those
physically handicapped and for
those who are not strong enough

“Y” Camp

Calls 250

Meeting with more than 125
upperclass leaders and faculty
members, 125 freshmen spent the
week-end at the annual Freshman
Camp sponsored by the Y.M.C.A.
on the Conoquenessing creek near
."'elienople.

A program of speeches by fac-
ulty members and student lead-
.ers, entertainment, and athletic
events gave the ﬁrst-year men an
opportunity to meet one another
and to get acquainted with activi-
ties leaders.

Serious advice on activities,
fraternities, and studies and
round-table_ discussions were bal-
anced with campﬁre stunts, mu-
sic, and entertainment. Represen-
tatives of the R.O.T.C., S.F.A.,
and various campus organizations
were present to aid the “Y” in
introducing the freshmen to them-
selves and to the University.

Red-Gold

- Vade Mecum
Is Guide Book

By their red and gold covers,
you will know them —— the new
1938-39 edition of “Vade Mecum”.

To the ancient Roman, “Vade
Mecum” meant simply “walk with

Ame” (see message opposite Miss

Amos’ picture). To the Pitt coed,
Vade Mecum means a guide to
who’s who and what’s what on
the campus, a calendar, datebook,
guidebook, and information bu-
reau all in one.

What’s new at Pitt this year?
Look in “Vade Mecum” for the
strange and mysterious tradi-
tions, the diiferent customs regu-
lations, and the turn-about-face
in the weekly calendar. In addi-
tion, all the social regulations
are now listed in black and white;
so that eds and coeds must be
up on their best Pittiquette.

"‘Ari‘tl for the ladies who never

can remember phone numbers

and things, there are reams of

blank paper just inside the rear
flap of “Vade Mecum’s” red and
gold cover!

Adult Study
Consolidated

Consolidation of adult part-
time programs at the University
was effected early this summer.

Frank W. Shockley, director of
the Extension Division and of
Summer Sessions since 1925, will
direct all the adult part-time pro-
grams of study, including the ex-
tension work and summer ses-
sions as before and the classes
held late afternoons, Saturdays,
and evenings.

J. Lloyd Mahony, director of
the Evening Division since 1934,
has been transferred to Erie
where he becomes director of the

University’s Junior College cen- ‘

ter. Dr. W. W. D. Sones, director
of the Erie Center since 1928, re-
turns to the campus as a profes-
sor in the School of Education.
Reason for the consolidation of

V the part-time programs under one

head was the simplifying of the
organization. The personnel of
the groups concerned have com-
mon problems and interests, it is
pointed out. Mr. Shockley has
directed all part-time programs
except the Evening Division work,
and registration in the Evening
and Saturday classes is typical of
that in extension and summer
courses: adults, most of whom
are-school teachers.

Cheering Block

Members of the S.F.A. Dem-
onstrations Block Committee met
yesterday to accept registrations
for participants. The committee
will meet each day this week in
801 C. L. to accept additional reg-
istrations. Heading the committee
are Edwin Ellis C39, chairman,
and Patsy Griﬂith, C40. The block

will see action at the West Vir-

ginia game Saturday.

Students in Edwin L. Peterson’s course in creative writing have

Library Adds
Many Books

Four thousand volumes of the
U. S. Congressional serial set
were cataloged by the University
library and have been made avail-
able to faculty and students in
the public document section of
the library, J. Howard Dice, li-
brarian, reports. ’

The Congressional set offers
source record information in his-
tory, politics, and activities of
governmental departments and
bureaus from the first Congress
to the present.

Of the 9,000 -volumes, 4,000
have been listed. It is hoped that,
in the near future, additions will
be made to the set in order to
complete the series.

One hundred books have been
purchased for the freshman
mens’ orientation program. These
have been placed temporarily at
the lending desk. These books
may be taken to the Mens’ read-
ing room for use. Later, these
books will be placed permanently
in the Men’s reading room.

Dean Holbrook Cites Demand

For Engineering Graduates

Placement of graduates of the
Schools of Engineering and Mines
at the University of Pittsburgh
during the past few years has
been an “excellent barometer of
industrial activity,” according to
Dean E.- A. Holbrook.

Last year of the 35 men who
were graduated from the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh School of
Mines, more than 90 per cent had
positions before June 1, Dean
Holbrook reports. This year only
25 per cent were placed before
June 1, but during July and Aug-
ust others have been given posi-
tions so that all of the 32 men
graduated in June will have posi-
tions this month.

“This demand for young tech-
nical men,” Dean Holbrook says,
“is a deﬁnite indication of in-
creasing industrial activity and
