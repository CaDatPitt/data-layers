EI;t;13N.TNN; TRIBUNAL
  IIREATENSMENAIEERIE

Tin cans, ﬂy paper, red bow ties,
knee pants and all kinds of attractive
signs are to be worn this week by the
Idisobedient frosli, according to the
dictates of the tribunal.

,Mosto___f the Freshmen were‘ appre-
hended for not wear their “dinks,” and
the common excuse, was “I _ forgot.”
One Freshman who was caught with
-his hat in his hand last Friday ex-
plained" at the tribunal that he has
to carry hisahat with him because he
goes home for the week-end. The
jury suggested that in the future he
should wear his “dink” on his "weak
end” where it belongs and further that
he wear a big red ribbon around his
neck to remind him of the fact.

GA member of the Freshman football
squad who was brought before the tri-
bunal for talking to co-eds had to
make a solemn promise to win the
next Freshman game. ‘

One Freshman was ordered
a big question mark in front of him
because he had committed an offense,
which, although it is not expressly
prohibited by the Freshman rules, is
of 'a questionable nature. -

Knee pants and socks are the dic-
tates of fashion issued by the jury
to a tall Freshman. Another ﬁrst

yearling will be seen strolling through
the halls wearing a tin can on his
head a'la Happy Hooligan, One of
the handsome‘Rodo1phs of the Fresh-
man class was said to be so‘irresist-
iblethat he has even attracted ﬂies.

This is, ho,§_vever,’no essay on the vague sub-

rails  for Progress

Research, as we know it, is the guiding hand
upon the purely creative activities of business.
‘Constantly it brings to _ light new aspects of
known laws, new visions. of laws yet to._be un-
covered. But the searchpfor these is not hap-
hazard‘ nor whimsical ; it is organized andplanned .
as carefully and thoroughly as any other busi- , A Q
ness activity. Whether chemical, electrical, or ‘ f‘ 
physical, it is engineering; and it follows engi-  7 V I
‘neering methods‘ andtradition. ' ‘
Many great engineers have been wholly at a
loss in this spedializved activity. For ‘research,
in "a. sense, reverses the usual order. -.I.ts_ en-I"
deavor is to discover unknown laws in the known
facts-a thing which is quiteat variance with
ordinary engineer-ing practice, Yet there is a.
ﬁne type. of engineering mind which ﬁnds its. it
great opportunity in thiskind of work. And to.
that type of mind, and that type of man, re-
search beckons with an unmistakable hand.’
It is "engineering pioneering, it blazes trails for
progress, to new triumphs, in.a wilderness into
whose outskirts man has scarcely penetrated.

_  J.’s.half foot mark. The-.long

- danger from behind its goal line to

- down deep into Pitt territory, the Red

e-ssary is to name the entire Pitt
‘ ‘eleven. However, several v ‘Pitt men
played ,in.,All-American fashion Sat-
urday. 0n~'the line, for instance, never
has there been seen twowmenplay bet-
ter than Jack Sack and Charley Bow-
ser did Saturday. The former played
on the line, while the latter played the
roving center position and backed up
theline. Every reputable and reliable
critic that witnessed the game Sat-
urday‘opined that Sack and Bowser
-both earned "all-American honors that
day. Sack was in every play, tore
holes consistently in the W. & J. line,
hurried the W. & J. kickers and throw-
ers; led interference,and,-in fact, ,did
everything excellently that Walter
Camp wants an all-American man to
do. Bowser showed that he was a
worthy successor to Bob; Peck and
Herb Stein, Pitt's two all-American
centers. He was hurt several times
during the game, but he refused to
leave. After all the regulars had been
removed, he was still in the battle,
playing quarterback. Even at. this
job, The shone, making several-long
gains that alntostresulted in a fourth
‘Pitt touchdown. _

In the backﬁeld all four men‘ per-
formed _brilliantly. Winterhurn han-
dled the team from" quarterback quite
well and gave a ﬁne account of him-
self, although he seldom carried the
ball. The other [three all gained
' steadily and , consistently. Anderson,

who issaid to be”unstop'_pable’,” again
Derformed "a ,la.“'McLaren.” He gained
. through .W. & J.’s line every time he
carried the ball and "many a .time he
-was” seen carrying a.1mQst the entire
.  &..J. line. with him. Flanagan
vc.orntinue.d his ﬁne work of the Geneva
__ and Penn games. Before the game,
“Hoot’_’ was suffering‘ from bronchitis‘,
but in thegame, he showed -‘no signs
of illness. He‘ gained as much ground.
as any’ man on‘ the ﬁeld, punted well,
and played his usual ﬁne defensive
game. L « ’

It took
to convince everyone that she was the
superior .of ill’. & J. Pitt kicked off
to W. «E: J., who, after failing to gain
much, punted to Pitt. Pitt returned
the punt but in a few moments W. &
J. punted back to Pitt._ But this time
'-Pitt“ was not to return {the ball to
W. &' J. From the Pitt 37-yard line
a'.long'march began *which ended on

march consisted of long ‘ gains by
Hewitt and Flanagan through the W.
.& J.‘.line and ﬁve consecutive ,,ﬁrst
downs, _ The ﬁfth first down was made
on W. & J ."s seven-yard". A Pitt, touch-
down now seemed inevitable, On, a
double pass, Hewitt tofAnderson, the
latter ‘made —‘}two, yards at rightjend.
Flanagan gained a yard on~the next
Play and, the quarter ended. Hewitt
carried the ball on the ﬁrst play in
the second. quarter. The ball was
brought to within one yard "of the
W.  -J. goal this time. Hewitt car-
ried the ball on the next play again,
but he failed by inches to score the
touchdown. The ball was now W., &
J.’s on its six,-inch line_. 7 ’ I‘

W. & J. punted out of immediate

the 26-yard line. Andersonlost two
yards on the first play,’ but‘ on the
next play he received a. forward pass.
from Flanagan who had received a
pass from Hewitt.’ No one was near
Anderson, who ran 14 yards over the
W. & J. goal for the ﬁrst touchdown.
“Pie” Williams kicked the goal after
the touchdown.

The second touchdown was made
several minutes later. It was scored
by Hewitt, but -was due chieﬂy to the
ﬁne work of Flanagan. Pitt kicked
off to W. & J. One of Brenkert’s
punts was caught by Flanagan on the
Pitt 37-yard‘ line and returned to the
W. & J. 20, arun of 43 yards. Two
plays -by Hewitt and Flanagan gave
Pitt a ﬁrst down on the W. & J. ‘ﬁve-
yard line, from which point Hewitt
carried it over the goal line" on a play
through tackle.‘ Williams missed the
goal this time. _ ' .

W. & J. received the kickoffthis
time and staged a long march via the
aerial route. ,The ball was brought

and - Black cohorts coming within
seven yards of the Gold and Blue
goal. But the aerial branch of the
game was not to advance W. & J. any
closer to the Pitt. goal, and the Pan-
thers were soon in possession of the
coveted ball. - Pitt held the ball long
enough for the half to end with the
ball still in her possession.

Both teams took the ‘ﬁeld in a de-
termined manner in the-‘second half.
W._ &»J. was determined to overcome
the 13-point lead as itldid two weeks
before against Lafayette. Pitt, on

You know that in a few years certain‘.ofour”con§emporarics,_
whose work is anathema to. the present generation, will-stand’
out like ‘giants. They will be hailed as great artists and geniuses
by those who now lack the critical discernment to understand
~ what they are trying todo. The genius of Swift, Milton, Blake,
Molierc, Ibsen, ‘Shelley, Poe, Thoreau, .Melvillc, and Whitman,’
to mention only a few, went unrecognized, except -by the dis-
criminating minority,‘ in their own generation. 'Don’t wait for
the next generation to see your contemporaries in perspective,

-In addition to the best work by the new generation, The Dial

Each -cheer was. distinct ‘and’ louder-

A LITTLE DOPE    

    

 

‘A COMPLETE vucronv

‘The W. &. J. team was a,co

nfident lot that trotted‘ out on"-th‘e field last

Saturday, It just took three plays to show them they were on the wrong
foot and the time for a, change was past. The spirit displayed by the
Panthers in that game has surpassed anything seen at Forbes Fieldfor a

long time.

It looked like a revival of the champion Pitt teams of a few

years back. The resourceful attack’ of the Panthers had the Red and Black

team completely demoralized after the first‘ few moments of play.

"The

Panthers really won with the visitors’ highly-touted weapon-,-an aerial pass.
It has been a long time since we have seen the massed interference of a

Warner machine work so effectively as in this game. ‘

The statistics really magnify the victory for the Panthers.

In [no department did the visitors outplay us—-the specialized forward

IN A.A.U. CHAMPS-

The Senior Allegheny Mountain As-
‘sociation Championship Cross Coun-
try Run was held Saturday under’, the

 

auspices. of. Carnegie -Tech over the‘

diﬁlcul-t. Schenley Park
course.

Coach_ Beeler’s ﬂrst team harriers
won the team trophy with a score of
26, while the second honors were an-
nexed by the Panther harriers with
a total of 42. Carnegie Tech second
team ﬁnished third with a total of 87
points. V V

The individual honors were taken
by Earl Johnson, the Negro distance
star of the Edgar Thompson Steel
A. A., present national cross country
and National ﬁve and ten mile cham-
pion. _Johnson, who led the entire
race ﬁnished about a. hundred yards
ahead of Howard'Dykeman, the Tech
star, who won the Syracuse Intercol-
legiate race two weeks ago; Dyke-
man fought hard the entire distance,
but his more experienced rival wore
himdowh. Ted Corbett, the ﬁrst Pan-
ther runner came into the Tech stad-'
ium just as Dykeman was ﬁnishing,
and took third honors with a sprint
that placed him safely out of reach

six mile

. of McKelvey, the second Tech man to

ﬁnish the race. ‘Ec.’ Hays, the sec-
ond Pitt man to ﬁnished, _.crossed the
line in sixth place. Folléwing-Hays
were Mendenhall, Tubbs ‘and Green-
law, all of Tech, and close on the heels
of the Tech Captain came’ Brook
Riley, Dale Schroedel and Joe _Wad-
kins of Pitt. The other runners ﬁn-
ished in‘ the following order:

13, Bright, Tech; 14, ‘White, Pitt;
15, Bender, ‘Tech; _16, Moore, Bethany;
17, ‘ Hinderer, Tech; 18, .'Slimpson,

cox, Tech; 23, Follower, Tech; 24,
Pregs, Tech; 25, Liberknight, Tech. _

The showing of ‘the Pitt team
against the veteran‘ and more expe-
rienced Tech team was very ‘good.
Carnegie Tech has had a; good season,-

and the harriers have made "a name

for themselves. Pitt has not had a
cross-country team for several years,
and this year’s squad :is made up
mostly of men who are running their
ﬁrst year at the hill and dale sport.
Corbett displayed splendid“ form when

_he easily headed every Tech runner
«except Howard Dykeman,

who ﬁn-
ished but a hundred yards before him.
Dyken1an'is considered by the East-
ern» critics as a. likely candidate for

New York City,_ November 27. (To,
win the Inter-collegiate Championship,
Dykeman needs‘ only to repeat his win
over the cross-"country stars _of’Cor_-
nell, Columbia, -Colgate, Syracuse and
Penn-State, which be accomplished

Teams to be Primed For An-
nual Clash-—Visitors Have
Lost Several Stars

 

Just _ one more game remains on
the home schedule forlthe Panthers.
The W. & J. clash is sweet history
and last year’s beating has been
avenged. The successful completion
of one great task is accomplished only
to ﬁnd another task to be bucked. On
Thanksgiving Day, the Pitt Panthers
tackle the Nittanyi Lions from Center
County. , '

The meeting of Pittan-d State on
the gridiron has come to be regarded
as the season’s most important con-
testby the followers of the two in-
stitutions. They always clash at the
end of the season and both teams are
generally primed to do their very best
and in past years. the games hav
been real battles. ‘

For the last two years, the two
‘teams ha.ve battled to scoreless ‘tie,
with the Penn ‘State the favorites "be-

‘ fore each contest, but _the Warner-

ites fought their disadvantage off and
the superiority has not yet been set-
tled. This year’s game, the conditions
-are somewhat changed. Pitt with
their slaughter of Wash-Jeff and their
victory over Penn and Syracuse, are
considered to have an even chance
with lsltate who has played a scoreless
tie with Syracuse and was beaten by
Penn and Navy.

Bezdek lost many good players by
graduation, and also two of his stars,
Redinger and Cornwell, went to’Col-
gate. A summary of the annual clash
with State follows: _

 

State“ won 13, Pitt won 9, two tied.
