Majors weeps as
Panthers beat
Temple Owls 53-52
at homecoming

The Pitt football team
pulled out all the stops in
Saturday’s Homecoming game

' against the Temple Owls. The

Panthers needed to pull out
every one of them, as they
squeaked by with a wild 53-52
victory.

The opening kickoff set

‘the tone for the game. Pitt’s

Hank Poteat ran the opening
kickoff back 53 yards to the
Temple 46-yard line, a sign of

’ special teams play that would

last the whole game. Poteat, a
freshnran, would have a total of

 

7 kickoﬁ and punt returns on
the day for 160 yards.

on the game’s ﬁrst play
from scrimmage, Panther quar-
terback Pete Gonzalez threw a
bomb downﬁeld to a wide-
open Jake Hoffart on a ﬂea-
ﬂicker to give Pitt a 7-0 lead.-

This play was typical of
Pitt’s p1ay—calling all day long.
Besides the ﬂea-ﬂicker, Pitt
tried four two-point conver-
sions, a fullback pass, and an
onside kick to open the second
half.

“Ipknew that I was in a
mood to take chances,” said
Pitt Head Coach Johrmy
Majors.

- Billy West (#20) dives ver the goal line for the game-winning‘ touchdown.

A 67-yard touchdown run
by Dwayne Schulters with
2:17 left in the ﬁrst quarter
gave Pitt a 17-14 lead before
the special teams took over
again early in the second quar-
ter. Schulters led all running
backs in the game with 107
yards.

Pitt’s ﬁrst drive of the sec-
ond quarter stalled on their
own 12-yard line. Nate
Cochran’s punt attempt was
blocked and recovered in the
end zone by Deadrake Epps.
Pitt’s Curtis Anderson took the
ensuing kickoff 91 yards to
reclaim a three—point lead, 24-

The Owls went into the locker
room with a 35-24 lead.
Things started to change a
little bit in the second half. '
“We played so much better
defense the second half, it was-
n’t even funny,” Majors said.
Temple quarterback
Henry Burris tore up the Pitt
defense in both halves. On a
day with inﬂated statistics for
all offensive players, Burris
had the most impressive num-
bers. He ran for 50 yards and
two touchdowns, and complet-
ed 25 of 41 passes for 445 .

The Homecoming celebration
looked like something out of Star
Wars.

Bigelow Boulevard was packed
full of people Friday night to see the
Cathedral of Learning explode in its
best Death Star impersonation, as
lasers were projected over the crowd,
and more fireworks blew up overhead.

“If the festivities continue to
improve like they have, more people
are sure to come back every year,”
Kristen Spriggs, a Pitt junior, said.

As “Roc,” the Pitt Panther mascot,
strolled through the crowd, large
speakers blasted music ranging from
Van Halen to Tom Jones, and of
course, John Williams, who wrote the
score for Star Wars, to complement the
chaos.

.“This is a great way to celebrate
Homecoming with students, faculty,
and alumni,” said Ashley Martin, a Pitt
senior.

Joe Cavalla, the director of Student
Activities, gave credit to the evening’s

sponsors and student organizers froml

the Pitt Program Council for setting up
the event.

“It gets better and better every
year. They really outdo themselves,”
Cavalla said. “It’s nice to finally see
Bigelow full of people. This is a great
start to a great weekend.”

After the fireworks, people shuf-
ﬂed under large arches made from bal-
loons to the dance held in the William
Pitt Union’s ballroom.

As the people filed in, the Pitt
Dance team kept up the excitement,
but soon the ﬂoor_was opened and stu-
dents, faculty, and alumni kept up their
own excitement with the “Macerana.”

SCHENECTADY, N.Y. — The
brother of suspected Unabomber
Theodore Kaczynski plans to leave
his job as assistant director at a
youth shelter to help with his broth-
er’s defense.

David Kaczynski, who alerted
the FBI after the Unabomber’s
creed was published, told the Daily
Gazette of Schenectady that he
viewed his efforts in defending his
brother as a ‘‘full—time job.” He
plans to continue working part—time
at the shelter. The Washington Post

WASHINGTON — Today begins
the Supreme Court’s term. Among
the cases being heard is Clinton vs.
Jones, in which President Clinton is
asking the Court to rule that Paula
Jones’ sexual harassment suit would
interfere with the duties of a sitting

until he leaves office. Lawyers for
Jones say that while lawsuits relat-
ing to his official responsibility are
protected, lawsuits stemming from
personal acts are not. The

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. —
Seymour Cray, the man behind the
design of the Cray supercomputer,

died Saturday ‘in a hospital in
Colorado Springs.

He died from complications
arising from injuries he sustained in
a car accident on Sept. 22. The Cray
supercomputers were the most pow-
erful supercomputers of the 1980s.
They were used by the Pentagon
and the National Security Agency,
as well as in such companies as
General Motors and Mercedes-

Benz. They were also used to solve.

problems such as designing nuclear

warheads and analyzing viruses.

Cray was known for hand-build-
ing computers and extensively test-
ing them. Cray was 71. The

SARAJEVO —— The Serb member

Momcilo Krajisnik and parlia-

at the inauguration because they
refused to swear an oath to a united

ambitious program that would make

Silent pro-life protest draws loud reaction from pro-choice group

5?? ..|nfie!d.. .

.
, H‘ /z‘ -*~-  " ' 

It was a typical fall day, surmy and
breezy. For many people, yesterday was a
day to be lazy or to play football on the
Cathedral Lawn. For others, it was a day of
responsibility —- to speak out about abortion,
through silent protest or loud marching.

From Belleﬁeld to Bouquet, men and
women, mostly white senior citizens from
area churches and some Pitt students of
Students For Life, stood along Fifth Avenue
like stone walls. They held signs that read
“Abortion Kills Children” and “Abortion
Kills Women.” ,

Members of the Campus Women’s
Organization and other groups marched
along the sidewalk shouting loudly behind
the pro-life protesters, “Not the church, not
the state, woman must decide her fate!”

It was a small—scale demonstration of the
tension on Capitol Hill and in the nation.
Both groups believe the other is wrong. Both
groups believe they are speaking the truth.

 

Mildred Benner, a senior citizen ﬁem
Grandview Church of God, said, “We’ve just
want people to know the truth. To know we
don’t believe in abortion, killing babies.” She
looked exhausted but cheerfully added,
“Hopefully we can inﬂuence them.”

Kim  CW 0 co—president, said
she felt much different. ‘This is about free-
dom of speech,” she said. “We want to spread
the truth as well. There is no way that white
males and the government are going to tell
women what to do with their bodies.

“Truth is pro—choice, is pro—reproductive
rights. If abortion is illegal, it’s not going to
stop. It will mean more deaths for women in
back-alley abortions.” .

These protests are an armual event.
Mary Lou Gartner, political action director of
People Concerned for the Unborn Child,
spoke for Life Chain, a Christian pro—life
organization.

“This is about the sixth year that [Life
Chain] has done this,” said Gartner. “We feel
that this is the only choice. Choice?
Everything you are today, you were the day

dents to come to Pitt.”

Even with this renewed emphasis on
academics, athletic scholarships have not
sulfered, according to Oval Jaynes, Pitt’s ath-
letic director.

“Fiscal years 1994-95 and 1995-96
have been the two best years in Pitt athletic
alumni giving,” Jaynes said This alumni
giving is used to improve athletic facilities
and equipment, but it is also used to ﬁnance
athletic scholarships.

The Athletic Department has been uti-
lizing this money in an eﬂort to make athlet-
ic scholarships available to as many students
as possible, especially in regard to women
athletes.

“We have added additional scholarships
in Women’s soccer and additional athletic-
based aid in Women’s swimming, track and
ﬁeld, gymnastics, and tennis,” said Jaynes.
“This is to increase the amount of_ ﬁnancial
help we give to our women athletes and to
create an even balance between men and
women.”

The increased amount of athletic schol-
arships awarded is beginning to have a posi-
tive eﬁ°ect on Pitt athletics, especially in rela-
tion to sports that traditionally don’t have a
deep budget. V

Drew Kopp, a sophomore Pitt soccer
player who received a partial scholarship,
said that-Pitt was better in offering scholar-
ship aid than the other schools he applied to,
and that gave him an added incentive to
come here. With this scholarship and the rel-
atively low cost of attending Pitt, Kopp could
afford college.

Even if students don’t receive an acade-
mic or athletic scholarship awarded by Pitt, it
is not a sign to give up the thought of partic-
ipating in higher education. There are schol-
arships available for undergraduate students
in the libraries, and these scholarships are
sponsored by private institutions, organiza-

 

tions, industries, and corporations, and range
from the local Eben Dernarest Trust through
the Mellon Bank of Pittsburgh. _

They award scholarships ranging in
value ﬁorn $9,100 for gifted individuals in
literature, music, art, and archeology to up to
$38,900 ﬁem the Research Corporation
Coltrell College Science Awards, which are
distributed to college students pursuing
research in the natural sciences.

“With these scholarships come the ques-
tion of how to decide which students will be
awarded merit-based ﬁnancial aid. The ques-
tion always involves whether it is fair to bal-
ance need—based aid versus merit-based aid.

“The basis that we in higher education
have rewarded students of academic and ath-
letic talent ﬁnancially to attend our institu-
tions is long rtmning,” said Altomari. “It is
not unique to the University of Pittsburgh. It
is something that has always been about. All
we try and do is ﬁt within that system.”

Some discount the system and claim it is
not fair to give out aid based on merit and not
need. ' I

“I’m not sure there’s a lot about any-
thing that is fair,” Altomari said. “Is it fair that
our academic standards exclude students
who really want to attend Pitt? It may not be
fair, but it is the process that is in place.”

Students who receive aid based on merit
defend their scholarships, by saying they
work on their studies just as hard as students
who work to pay for their own schooling.

“I worked extremely hard up to this
point to get something like this,” said Ben
Senkowicz, a ﬁeshman academic scholar-
ship recipient. “I believe these peopleshould
get [merit] scholarships because they bring
something to the school, whether it be
through athletics to strengthen the athletic
program .-.. or through academics which give
the school a positive reputation for academic
excellence.” ‘

CWO has protested in the past at the
same time. “We’ve done this before. We let
everybody know about it. We found out the
SFL was involved. So we counter-react,”
Christina Douaihy of CW 0 shouted over the
chanting.

“We demand that our freedom not be
taken away. We want to let people know, on
our campus, what we want.”

While the pro—choice group’s goal was
to draw attention, Life Chain was quieter. “I
think silence says more than screaming,” said
SFL member Christy Hough. ‘

CWO was ﬂre rowdy group, shouting
and drawing both supporting cheers and
expletives ﬁorn passers-by. “We want to be

the ones with the voice,” explained Douaihy.
“The anti-choice folks are older; We’re repre-
senting the campus. There are people here
ﬁom other organizations. This is not just a
woman’s issue, it’s everybody’s issue. But
nonconﬁontational. We’re not out to start
ﬁghts.” '
Both groups were pleased with the tum-
out But by around 3 p.m., it was getting hot,
and people were getting tired. Some pro-
choice supporters were hanging back, and
three children sitting on the steps of
Belleﬁeld Presbyterian looked over-
whelmecl ’
“They’re loud, aren’t they?” said Tiffany
Ahwang, 7, whose parents were supporting
the Life Chain, as the CW 0 marched past.

“This is the first time I’ve been to
this festival,” said Pitt senior Alison
Marinak. “At a time when there doesn’t
seem ‘to be much school spirit, it’s nice
to see that there really is.”

The large turnout surprised Rona
Pomerico, a Pitt sophomore. “On a
Friday night, a lot of people showed up
for this,” she said, “It’s really cool.’’

The attitude throughout the union
that evening was positive and ener-
getic. The Red Room had tapes playing
of the 1976 Pitt football team which
captured the national championship
that year.

Pitt junior Megan Zoschg said, “If

here, Pitt will definitely win.”

staff writer for the Post-Gazette, chose to illustrate how
his public crying jags are a good thing and a trend which
should be followed. Thanks, but no thanks.

It is time that we went back to the days where men
were men, and only sissies cried. Can you see John
Wayne, The Duke, shedding a tear over losing a card
game? Hell, no; he’d grit his teeth, pull his gun, and start
a bar—room brawl. The Duke was a man of action. He did-
n’t have the time, nor the patience, for tears. You would-
n’t catch John Wayne with tears streaming down his face,
using the back of his hand to wipe his nose.

The problem with today’s society is that too many
people think it is acceptable’ to use crying as an excuse for
inaction. Instead of taking the mind set of “OK, I didn’t
win today, so I’ll try harder tomorrow,” crybabies usually
just throw up their hands in despair and weep. -

To be fair, we would like to also point out that we
think it is unacceptable for women to weep in public as
well. Women are indeed as tough as men. Therefore,
when it comes to having the resolve to take one on the
chin and keep going without feeling the need to cry,
women should be held to the same social constraints as
men.

The “no tears” rule should apply to everyone over the
age of seven. After the first grade, one should have devel-
oped the social skills necessary to mingle amongst soci-
ety. No more trembling lower lips and tear-stained faces.
It’s time we learned the ultimate lesson from The Duke
and acted like responsible, respectable human beings.

Here's the straight dope on Holland

 

Holland is and always will be a
major part of me. I’m writing these
columns in the vague hope that
somebody’s curiosity will be piqued

s enough that they’ll decide to go

there. I would love to have just a
few more people know Holland.
No, it’s not a paradise. Nowhere is.
However, it has so much more to
offer than what its stereotypical

. image would lead you to believe.

Yes, there are tulips: ﬁelds and
ﬁelds of richly—colored, perfectly-
forrned rows ‘of them. When the
ﬂowers are at the height of their
beauty, they are cut off at the base,
and you see magniﬁcent heaps of
color lying at the edge of the ﬁelds.
This is because the ﬂowers aren’t
what the farmers want; it’s the bulbs
which they sell. This tulip ﬂowering
only happens once a year.

Of course, there are windmills.
Windmills played a major role in the
drying of the marshlands that made
the Netherlands adaptive to agricul-
ture. They dot the landscape, and
you often see them as you travel

. across the land. Since the great land

reclamation was more or less ﬁn-
ished by 1500, they aren’t as impor-
tant as they once were.‘Sometimes
they are in working order, and
sometimes they’re tourist attrac-
tions. In Utrecht there’s one in the
middle of the city that has been con-
verted into a butcher " shop.
Obviously that one doesn’t turn any-
more. But not every glance out
across the ﬂat Dutch landscape will
land on a windmill.

There are indeed wooden
shoes. I saw people wearing them

 

 

while I was there. They are very
practical for working in the garden,
since it really doesn’t matter if they
get dirty and they keep your feet dry.
Construction workers wear them
sometimes. Naturally, there are also
those crazy soccer fans who wear
them simply as an easily recogniz-
able symbol of the Netherlands to
show their support for the national
team. But not everyone wears
wooden shoes.

, Marijuana is legal. If you want
to smoke, you walk" into a coffee
shop and buy a couple of grams of
whatever type you want, and you’ll
get it in a small plastic bag with a lit-
tle green marijuana leaf printed on

it. Written in English, a coffee shop.

sells marijuana. Written in Dutch, a
coffee shop sells coffee. No more
and no less people smoke there than
here. There it’s just safer, cheaper,
better, and the government makes a
lot of money from it. The
Americans, with their usual ﬂair for
excess, are the only ones who
smoke joints without mixing the
marijuana with tobacco. But just
because it’s legal does not mean that
everyone smokes it.

The whole deal with the mari-
juana issue is that it is NOT an
issue, nor is it a big deal. None of
the letters l’ve received from friends
who also spent a year in Holland
have been about how much ‘they
miss the marijuana. There’s just so
much more to Holland. It’s not a
special place because having a joint
is legal. It’s a special place because
it’s unique. There are so many better
reasons to go to Holland.

’ There are the small, friendly
pubs with a candle on every table.
There are the brilliant, stunning,

 

world—famous clubs in Amsterdam. J

There are the cheese stores whose
variety is rr1ind—boggling and would
make any cheese-lover’s heart
jump. The architecture creates an
atmosphere that is like no other in
the world. The local markets, with
their wide range of fresh foods and
pastry stands, are a colorful sight to
behold — always busy, even in the
pouring rain. Train stations are espe-
cially amazing to Americans, who
aren’t used to a clean, functional,
punctual, and well—used public
transportation system. The custom
of getting a cookie with a cup of
coffee or tea ordered in a restaurant

‘or bar is another peculiarity. The

much wider choice of music groups
and genres in record stores is espe-
cially appealing to music .lovers.
The ability of almost all Dutch peo-
ple to speak English and probably a
bit of French or German is always a
point of admiration for people trav-
eling in Holland who don’t speak
Dutch.

I could go on about the many
sights, traditions and habits of the
Netherlands. Obviously, marijuana

- is not a major part of daily life sim-

ply because it’s legal. The Dutch
just decided to be more practical
about the “issue.” There’s no good

reason not to have marijuana be '

legal, and the Dutch government
realized that. So to those of you who
would go to Holland for the sole
reason to smoke a joint: don’t ever
say or imagine that you know any-
thing about Holland. To those of
you who would go to explore anoth-
er culture: have a smoke if you want
to.

Machteld de Waard doesn’t smoke
and doesn ’t care if you do.

SPORTS

 

Feels like the

very first time

 

You’ve all been there before — you
know, when you go through a little
drought.

It’s frustrating. Sometimes you won-
der if you’ll ever get any again. You get
tense, pushy, irritable, and desperate.
There are times when a 300—pound person
looks more seductive than Aphrodite. You
know, you’ve all been there before.

Then you finally get some, and that
night goes great (sometimes the following
morning might come as a shock.) To
quote Chris Elliot in the hit movie Cabin
Boy, “These pipes are clean.”

That black cloud has been lifted, and
you feel like a man (or a woman) again.
You can focus on your studies better, your
thoughts aren’t cluttered, and you can
rejoin your friends’ conversations 5’ with
exciting new insight and knowledge.

The Pitt football team feels the same

-way after winning their first Big East

game in a dog’s age; you know, that good
kind of fatigue, the kind of fatigue that
makes you want to light up a cigarette and
reﬂect on a good night.

You see, ‘Pitt showed more moves
than Don Juan DeMarco in seducing the
Temple Owls. Think about it, Pittput Wﬂt
Chamberlain and Gene Simmons, two
“studs” with numerous stories to share, to
shame.

You have to admire Pitt’s dedication
and desire —— the willingness to go the
extra yard, to tease and titillate the oppo-
nent until the ﬁnal climatic end, complete
with a celebration that resembled some of
Rome’s ﬁnest orgies.

You could say the Pitt defense “went
down” on Temple’s oﬂfense. Pitt drove
Temple quarterback Henry Burris wild,
submitting to his demands, letting him

throw for 445 yards and three TDs. On the ‘

ground, Burris whipped Pitt’s defense for
50 yards and two TDs.

Bunis dictated all the early action. It’s
almost like Pitt pretended to forget con-
doms, secretly knowing that after a few
hours of fun—ﬁlled foreplay, they could

Lytle’s late-
gcime heroics
topple Temple

evin Lilley

   

Somewhere in the shufﬂe, Matt

Lytle got lost.
Pete Gonzalez was named starter for
Saturday’s Homecoming contest.

Freshman Tony Zimmerman was named
heir—apparent. Lytle, starter a year ago
and starter early this season, wasn’t
named anything.

After his three touchdowns in under
11 minutes last weekend, Lytle is back.
And while Head Coach Johrmy Majors
has yet to armounce a starter for next
week’s contest, the name might stick.

“I’m just happy Coach Majors
believed in me,” said Lytle after his
game-saving heroics. “He put me in
there to get the job done.”

Majors put him in there at 10:23 in
the fourth, after Gonzalez racked up 33
points but failed to keep pace with the
Owls’ 52-point barrage. The starter’s 9
for 16, two-touchdown performance
was adequate, according_to Majors, but
the situation called for a new offensive
leader.

“Pete wasn’t pleased with it, but we
were three touchdowns down at that
point,” said the head coach. “It wasn’t
all the quarterback. Sometimes a
change, even wrong, will work for you.”

Lytle’s ﬁrst drive started at the Pitt

 

Matt Lytle (#8) comes off the bench in the fourth quarter, propelling Pitt to victory..

35, with two straight Dwayne Schulters
rushes for seven total yards. It would be
the last time all game that Pitt would run
back-to-back running plays.

The quarterback took over on third
down with an 11-yard first-down strike
to Mark Butler. Pitt gained no yards on
the next three plays, but on fourtl1-and-
10, Lytle found Butler for another 11'
yards and another first down.

The Lytle-Butler team wouldn’t
have to save the Panther drive again, as
the. offense clicked in behind the sopho-
more signal-caller. They did, however,
reunite for a four—yard scoring pass to
end the drive and give Pitt its first touch-

down in the second half. Jake Hoffart

caught the two-point conversion to pull
the Panthers within 11.

“I was in the ballgame the whole
time mentally,” said Lytle, when asked
about his successful late performance.

Patrick Robertson

  

“When Coach Majors made the deci-
sion, I was ready to go.”

The Temple drive stalled quickly
thanks to the Pitt defense, but a Josh
Boies punt pinned the Panther offense
down at the 11-yard line. A quick hold-
ing play after an incompletion gave the
Panthers second—and-21 at the ﬁve, with
just under six minutes left.

Ninety-ﬁve yards away from the
target, Lytle took over. Running a no-
huddle offense, the backup quarterback
ran seven straight pass plays, completing
two to Hoffart and three to Butler,
including another touchdown. The two-
point pass to Billy West fell to the astro-
turf harmlessly, but the Panthers had
momentum and only a ﬁve-point deﬁcit‘
to overcome.

The score ‘gave the oﬁense more

conﬁdence, and according to Temple’s

the 67:51 mark in the second half to hand Pitt (1-10) its V

second straight defeat. The goal was Wood’s second of the
season, and was aided by an assist from forward Michelle
Tracey. -

Pitt opened the scoring at 16240 of the first half when
freshman midﬁelder Megan Beasley tallied her second goal
of the season on a penalty kick. Beasley is second on the
team in scoring behind the injured Mia Mora. _

For nearly 40 minutes, the game remained 1-0, but
Seton Hall midﬁelder Amy McKee tied the score on an
unassisted goal from the right side of the goalie box at the
50:46 mark of the second half.

As usual, Pitt was outshot by the opponent. The Hall
registered 11 shots to the Lady Panthers’ six. Pitt goalie
Sarah Stout made three saves.

Panthers spike Lady Dukes in straight sets

4566/ .u/ /'r.-.- z,- ».A/A3‘

’ After finishing up a long month of
tournaments, the Pitt volleyball team
made a smooth transition into the “sin-
gle match” portion of the regular sea-
son. It came as an easy victory over
crosstown rival Duquesne last week at
Penn-Trafford High School.

The Panthers (7-8) took just one
hour and 17 minutes to disperse of the
Lady Dukes, 15-11, 15-7, and 15-8.
Freshmen hitters,Paula Zemrowski and
Julie Cress led the way for Pitt with a
combined 26 kills and 11 digs.

Cress showed a glimpse of the
future as the tearn’s best all-around

 

player against Duquesne (7-6) ﬁring 12
kills, 10 digs, four block assists, and an
ace. The freshman is third on the team
with 12 service aces this season.

Zemrowski continued her impres-
sive showing in the 1996 campaign,
ﬁnishing with 14 digs and a .500 kill
percentage in the victory. The
Michigan native leads the team with
3.35 kills per game. She is also second
on the squad with 131 spikes.

Only senior all-star Jennie
Driscoll has more kills this season
(166), contributing seven more in last
week’s victory at the neutral sight in
Trafford, Pa.

Head Coach Cindy Alvear’s
squad dominated Duquesne, holding

them to a .122 kill average over the
three games. Only two Lady Duke
players ﬁnished with over 10 kills.
Katie Michalski led Duquesne with 12
kills and 15 digs. q

The Panthers get set for a com-
fortable week at home with four match-
es at the Fitzgerald Field House. Pitt
takes to the court against local oppo-
nent St. Francis tomorrow night before
hosting Kent and Big East opponents
Seton Hall and Rutgers this weekend.

Henry Burris, it spilled over.

“When Pitt made that play, when
they scored that touchdown,” said Burris
of the second Lyt1e—Butler score, “they
became a completely different team.
That was a completely different team on
defense.”

The Pitt defenders stonewalled
Temple on the next series, taking the ball
on downs after stopping the Owls on
fourth—and—short. Lytle was the beneﬁ-
ciary of good ﬁeld position (the drive
started at the Temple 43), but the gain
came with a tradeoff — the defense had
taken Pitt’s ﬁnal two "timeouts when
preparing for the Ow1’s fourth—down
play.

While the team ran a two—minute
offense for most of the fourth quarter,
they now had an excuse — the clock was
stopped at 2:44. Lytle tossed two quick
incompletions before hooking up with
Butler again for a Panther ﬁrst down. He
would complete two of his other four
passes on the drive, amassing 21 addi-
tional passing yards and setting up Billy
West’s six-yard scoring dash into
Homecoming history.

“That was one of the most outstand-

Men's soccer
record drops
to 3-5-1

phlvaﬂ Townsend

 

The men’s soccer team lost Saturday
to the Georgetown Hoyas 2-0. With the
loss, Pitt continued its winless futility in
the Big East, dropping to 3-5-1 overall
and 0-5-1 in the conference.

“We’re all frustrated about what’s
going on with the team,” said sophomore
midﬁelder Drew Kopp. “We had our
chances to score, we just didn’t put the
ball in the net. We played well, except for
a few defensive lapses that ended up in
goals.”

Sophomore forward Eric Kvello of
Georgetown scored at the 15:49 mark of
the first half. Brandon Lieb began the
play with a pass to sophomore Bill
Bednarz, who headed a pass to Kvello,
who then one-timed a shot from 10 yards
out.

The Hoyas scored their second goal
less than ﬁve minutes later on Tom
Greaser’s goal from six yards out. Senior
midfielder Gil—Ignacio Ascunce and

. freshman midﬁelder Kevin Shaw picked
. up assists on the goal. Ascunce started the

play with a pass to Shaw in the penalty
box. Shaw then fed Greaser for theigoal
and a 2-0 lead.

“It was a disappointing loss. I felt we
were starting to get back on track, but this

was a step backwards,” said Head Coach 1

Joe Luxbacher. “'Ihe difference in the
game was that we had chances and didn’t
convert, and they did. We didn’t play as
well as we can. We were missing some
players to injuries, but the guys who ﬁll
in should be able to play at the same
level.”

The difference between last year, in
which Pitt ﬁnished second in the Big
East, and this year is that Pitt won the
close games last year.

“We are not coming up with the big
plays this year and last year we did,” said
Luxbacher. “We aren’t getting dominat-

Pitt’s foreplay worked. Temple
became giddy late in the first half after
Van Johnson scored on a 30-yard strike
from Burris to give the Hooters, I mean

Owls, a 35-24 lead. Temple gushed with‘

ecstasy, fantasizing about defeating Pitt
for the second straight year, an accom-
plishment that would make Pitt the
utmost of subrnissives, clearly a partner
that would be dominated for years to
come. .

However, Pitt found that path too
kinky and needed an assertive, take-
charge player to enter the playing ﬁeld
with a willingness to stimulate and arouse
Pitt’s curiosities towards winning. That

back Matt Lytle, who last week was third
on the depth chart, but found the condom
in the fourth quarter and got to partici-
pate.

Lytle put an end to the foreplay, he
wanted to deliver the ﬁnished product.
He led Pitt’s offense to three scores in less
than 10 minutes of quick, hard, punishing
action that drove Pitt people into a heated
tizzy, at least the ones that didn’t leave at
halftime because the alumni’s collective
buzz was dying down. -

Pitt pulsated through the openingsof
the Temple defense. They shoved crucial
ground strokes, I mean runs, down
Temple’s throat and penetrated the sec-
ondary with aerial maneuvers that would
make the nimblest of porn stars proud.

Finally, as Pitt reached a level of
excitement that they hadn’t experienced
in quite some time, Billy West erupted for
a six-yard explosion that climaxed an
exciting, pu1se—wrenching conquest for

ter. On Temple’s ﬁrst possession of the
quarter, Josh Boies punted to Poteat. Poteat
fumbled, and Temple recovered. That set
up a touchdown that gave Temple its
biggest lead of the game, 52-33.

At that point, Pitt’ savior entered
the game. Matt Lytle, who as recently as
last week was Pitt’s third—st1ing quarter-
back, engineered three touchdown drives
in nine minutes during the fourth quarter.

Majors said of Lytle’s work, “That
was one of the most outstanding come-
backs that I’ve been involved with. In the
locker room, I was still a little bit dazed and
shocked. It brought tears tomy eyes.”

In less than one quarter, Lytle was
12 for 20 passing for 155 yards and two
touchdowns.

“I was ready to go. I was in the
ball game the wholetime mentally,” Lytle
said. “The only thing that was going
through my mind was to get the ball in the
end zone.” -

Lytle’s entrance into the game also
sparked Mark Butler. Butler ﬁnished the
game with eight catches for 84 yards and

two touchdowns. All but 18 yards of
Butler’s total came from Lytle.

Still, the deﬁning moment in the
game came from Pitt’s defense, which was
almost nonexistent for most of the after-
noon. On fourth-and—one from their own
43, Temple faked a punt. Backup quarter-
back Pat Bonner took the snap and was
tackled for no gain by Marlin Young. That
stop set up Pitt’s garne-winning drive,
capped off by a six-yard run by Billy West
with 1:10 to play.

After the game, Temple Coach
Ron Dickerson went to extremes in blam-
ing himself for the loss.

“I wouldn’t blame the University
if they ﬁred me right now,” Dickerson said.
“I told the team I’m resigning at the end of
the season. I lost this football game today.
This team deserves more. They deserve a
smarter coach than myself.” _

For Pitt, the first conference win in
two seasons was ﬁnally reason to celebrate.

“I want to sit back and enjoy this
victory,” Majors said. “There haven’t been
too many lately.”

ed, we just need some people to step up
and make plays.”

The Big East is one of the most high-
ly skilled leagues in the nation, boasting
four top—25 teams ’

“Playing in the Big East means you
have to play well every game and if you

 

don’t, you lose,” said Luxbacher. “We
have enough talent to win and we’re not,
which is frustrating.”

Kopp says the pressure is beginning
to mount on the Panthers.

“I think we can turn this around,”
Kopp said, “but we better do it soon
because we are running out of time.”

The team will try to rebound at home
Wednesday against West Virginia.
