UNIVERSITY OF “PITTSBURGH

Seminar
addresses
racism,
sexism

By Milt Klopfer
Staff Writer

Dr. Manning Marable
remembers an incident several
years ago at Purdue University
when a cross was burned in front
of the university’s black cultural
center and a racist death threat
was found carved on a black
graduate assistant’s door.

“The university administration
was prompt in its response,” he
said. “They sent a man from
maintenance over with a sander
to sand down the door. That was
its response to this death threat.”

The need for truly effective
responses to the problems of
racism and sexism in the academic
community was addressed by

Marable and others at Saturday’s

“Sexism and Racism in
'lniversities” conference at the
ririck Fine Arts Auditorium.
According to Marable, a
distinguished scholar and author
from the University of Colorado,
racism is the systematic
exploitation of a group and the
subordination of their culture.
“African Americans, Latinos and
native Americans can be many
things, but they cannot be racist.
For the simple reason that people
of color, and African Americans

~ in particular, do not have any

power structure to impose their
collective perceptions about
whites into a set of institutions
that limit or discriminate against
whites as a group,” said Marable.

“What we ﬁnd occurring in the
19803 and into the decade of ’90s
in higher education is a ‘new’
type of racism. A kind of racism
thatis ‘more acceptable,’” he said.

Marable points to a new
generation of white students who
believe that the absence of racial
violence means that interracial
harmony has been achieved.
Those who believe this are wrong,
said Marable.

He quoted a recent Newsweek
poll which stated that only 57
percent of all white students asked
believed that colleges should
increase their efforts to recruit
more minority students.

Only about 20 percent of those
polled strongly supported

...a-attempts to hire minority faculty,

he said.

“The vast majority of white
students take very few or no
courses which explore the
heritage or cultures of non-
Western peoples or minorities
within American society. Outside

Pulitzer winning journalist Neil Sheehan talks about the Vietnam War experience in the
Assembly Room of the William Pitt Union last Thursday.

By Lou Grieco
News Editor

Unless Americans realize that the Vietnam War
was unwinnable, 52,000 men died in a “wasted
war,” according to former war correspondent
and prize-winning journalist Neil Sheehan.

“We must learn from the experience,” Sheehan
told an audience in the Assembly Room of the
William Pitt Union last Thursday. “If you look at
Vietnam honestly and-. coldly, you have to see
that the war was unwinnable. The truth is
uncomfortable, bitter and disiliusioning, but we
must confront it.”

Sheehan, who recently won a Pulitzer Prize
and the National Book Award for his book A
Bﬁgbtsbininglie, ]obnPaul Vann and/lmen'ca
in Vietnam, said that one of the main reasons the
war was unwinnable was because ‘US. military
leaders “ignored the phenomenon of national
communism.

“We had a simplistic view of the world. It was

the forces of darkness, communism, against the
forces of light, which was us. [Truman Secretary
of State] Dean Acheson felt that all communist
countries were controlled by a switchboard in
the Kremlin.”

He added that the United States refused to
change this view, even after Tito broke away
from Stalin’s Iron Curtain, viewing Tito as an
“aberration.”

Sheehan also told the story of the capture of a
friend, Doug Ramsey, in Vietnam to illustrate this
point. One of Ramsey's captors, a 16-year-old
Viet Cong member, changed Ramsey's ideology.

“The boy asked Ramsey, ‘Why have the
Americans come to make war on us?’ “ Sheehan
said. “Ramsey then tried to explain the domino

S/oee/oan urges Pitt staalents to
accept Viemam as /a7/zwz'm/table’  

theory to him, and this 16-year-old boy looked
at my friend Ramsey and said, ‘You’re crazy.
Don’t you know the Chinese are our traditional
enemies? Just because they are a socialist
government doesn’t mean we want to take
orders from them.’

“Ramsey said that he never heard such fervent
nationalism. He then decided that this nationalism
was the best barrier against Chinese expansion.”

Sheehan added that North Vietnam leader Ho
Chi Minh became a member of the French
Socialist Party because it was the only party in
Paris that advocated Vietnamese independence
from France. N

Another reason Sheehan said that the war
effort was doomed from its beginning was the
arrogance of the American military leaders, who
felt infallible since the end of World War II.

“The miracle of World War II made the leaders
essentially irrational. Their sense of reality had
been replaced by arrogance. They had become
men who were stupefied by too much success
and money.”

Sheehan cited the forms used during Vietnam
to report the events of battle. The forms were
only capable of recording success. “[The leaders]
did not want to be told that what they wanted to
do would not work. There were no forms
marked ‘Failure Reports,"’ he said.

In 1963, Ho ChiMinh predicted that Americans
would not waste theirlives in Vietnam to a Polish
diplomat
Sheehan said “he was giving us more credit than
we deserved. We had lost the ability -to realize
that we could lose a war.

“In 1965, [Marine Corp Lt. Gen.) Victor Krulak

Professor
discusses
Pitt hate
crimes

By Suzanne Sabol 0
Staff Writer

A Nigerian professor pointed
to an attack on one of his students
as an illustration of the problem
of racially motivated violence at
Pitt while speaking about campus
racism Friday. »

Addressing the Pitt International
Student Organization, Dr.
Emmanual Anise of the political
science and black studies
departments. told the story of a
Nigerian student who was
attacked three weeks ago after a
weekend movie.

The student, heading toward
Forbes Quad after leaving David
Lawrence Auditorium, walked
past two white men. He was
attacked from behind and woke
up in Presbyterian-University
Hospital with a broken jaw and
three missing teeth.

“What was his crime?” Anise
asked, “That he was black and
spoke with a foreign accent.

“The police did nothing about
[the assault]. The student couldn’t
identify his attacker, so that was
it. Case closed,” Anise said.

“He’s lucky he lived. If he [had]
been killed, it would have been
an international incident,”
between the United States and
the Nigerian governments,
according to Anise.

Anise spoke angrily of other
schools where there have been
racial problems. He talked of the
racial riots at Penn State last
winter. _

The University of Michigan also
had racial problems last year.
Because of the many racial slurs
written on windows, bathrooms
and walls on campus, black
students went on strike, and black
faculty refused to teach, said
Anise. .

Another racial incident involved
an Ethiopian student in Montana.
He was beaten to death on the
street in broad daylight, according
to Anise.

The Pitt campus is just as
dangerous, said Anise._“lf you
walk on the street at night from
Bouquet Street to McKee lPlacel,
you’re taking your life in your
hands, especially if you’re a
foreign or black student or a
woman."

Anise deﬁned racism as “the
attribution of negative
connotations to a person solely
because of belonging to a
particular race.”

He said, “People think blacks

Gay rights activists protest FDA for lack of AIDS drugs

By Jennifer Calabrese
and Jeff Tatusko
The Pitt News

In response to whatthey call
the neglect of the government
and the Food and Drug
Administration to make AIDS
drugs more readily available,
members of the gay and lesbian
rights group Cry Out! protested
outside of the Federal Building
on Friday.

Pittsburgh

By Chris Studebaker V,
For The Pitt News

Fifteen Western Pennsylvania
hospitals, including five from the

 Pittsburgh area, will combine their

V participate

services to form what is believed
to be the first ‘hospital-based,
independent healthcare network
in this area. I

The network, known as First -

Health Alliance, includes Western
Pennsylvania Hospital, Central
Medical Center and Hospital,
Harmarville Rehabilitation Center,
Divine Providence and Ohio
Valley Hospital. . . ,

According to Donald Doyle,
the president of the network, the
concept‘ was developed by
Western Pennsylvania Hospital,
Central Medical Center and

Hospital and the Pittsburgh
HCA .

District Office of

cl‘/lanagement Co.

“Networking is a concept
whose time has come in this
region,” said Doyle. “There are
tremendous ‘pressures on‘
hospitals today to deliver
healthcare that is of first quality,

» yet affordable and accessible. It

is virtually impossible for an
individual hospital to do it all on
their own,” he added.

The hospitals in the network
will share clinical and
administrative resources,
in physicians’
continuing education programs,
build a regional physician referral
system and take advantage of a
variety of group purchasing
arrangements.

Also available to the
participating hospitals will be

shared medical arrangements, I

such as temporarily staffing a
hospital’s emergency room,
mobile technology, specialized

gclinics and part-time physician

coverage.

The new alliance is a “natural
response to the area’s rapidly
changing \ healthcare
environment,” said Eric F.
Rieseberg, district vice president
of HCA Management. Rieseberg
etllded that the basic goal of the
alliance is ‘to help individual
hospitals enhance the overall
quality of care.

“Time isn’t the only thing that
the FDA is killing," read the bold
letters on some of the signs carried
by the protesters.

“People are dying because of
the red tape involved in getting
much-needed AIDS drugs
approved. It is a disgrace, and
something has to be done,” said
Bill Hileman, president I of Cry
Out!.

The Pittsburgh protest was just
one part of a network of AIDS

protests and civil disobedience
actions that took place on Oct. 6
across the country. About 25 Cry
Out! members and several
members of Pitt’s Gay and Lesbian
Alliance rallied from 4 to 6 p.m.
to demand that the FDA hasten
the approval process for new
AIDS drugs.

These multi-focus actions were
timed to‘ coincide with the final
unfolding of the Names Quilt in
Washington, D.C.

“Pittsburgh’s Cry Out! is joining
other groups in several cities in a
National ‘Day of Anger’ regarding
the government’s response to the
AIDS crisis. The snail’s pace with
which new drugs move through
the FDA’s approval process is a
genocidal outrage, ” Hileman said.

AZT is currently the only AIDS
drug which has been approved

by the FDA since the start of the

U.S. epidemic, and Hileman said, U '

“While it may help some people,
it is a poison for others.

Mark Smith, president of GALA,
agreed. “It’s time for them to kill
the empty rhetoric and start
worrying about the people in this
country who are
needlessly. ”

are all lazy, thieves, ’ drug
addicts,and they’re not supposed
to be intelligent.”

Anise said many black students
run into this kind of prejudice,
even from their professors.

He said, “If a black student
takes a class like physics,
chemistry or
mathematics, the professor may
ask, ‘Are you sure this is the class
you want?’ while thinking, ‘Your
kind is not supposed tobe in
advanced math.’ This is racism
among your eminent professors; ”

Anise himself has run into this

type of prejudice. He said that
although he has been teaching at
Pitt since 1975, other faculty
members have asked him if he’s
a graduate student.

“Why? Because my white
colleagues can’t believe I’m a
faculty member,” said Anise.

According to Anise, professors
should help break racial
stereotypes instead of “using their
intellectual capabilities to
empower their racist perspectives.
Many professors, as bright and

highly educated as they are,

believe that black students can’t
get better than Cs.

the classroom, there are few
structured opportunities for
people of color to interact with
other white students,” he said.

Marable suggests that “students
should create a pluralistic
environment for education. In
order to understand someone,
we must first accept his or her
culture,” he said.

“The student organizations
should be aware that the fact that
Pitt has so few faculty of color
undermines the quality of their
education,” he said.

The importance of minority
faculty members in the academic
community was further stressed
by Dr. Emma Lucas of Chatham
College.

“Students must be made aware
that other cultures have values as

valid as their own cultures,” she
said.

Lucas also believes that minority _

faculty serve as important role
models and mentors for minority
students.

“lBlack students] Can’t always
find a black faculty member just
to talk about the problems they
have,” she said.

To those minority students that
feel that they don’t need the
support and guidance of a
minority academic community,
Dr. Laurence Thomas of Syracuse
University offered a different
perspective.

“With the right history of one’s
past, one can do anything,” said
Thomas.

“White males tend to
underestimate the power of their
cultural past, yet they live and
work with a backdrop that
includes Plato, Aristotle and Kant.”

Thomas sees the need of
minorities to develop their own
rich sense of past and culture.

Such a sense should both affirm *

and give confidence to members
of the group. L

“To do this, [minorities] must
become authorities on things that
people don’t expect [minorities]
to be authorities on. If we would

do that, we would wrench
authority from the status quo, ” he
said.

According to Thomas, once a
minority becomes an authority
on a non-rninority issue, more
attention will be paid when a
minority issue is being dealt with.

“You can do something
tomorrow morning,” said
Thomas. “That’s very important
to realize.”

Thomas suggests to minority
students that they bring elements
of their own cultural experiences
and history into their standard
course work. Papers should be
written to explore the political,
historical or social aspects of their
own unique cultures and how
they relate to the subjects of the
course.

“Without making a fuss,” he
said, “you have the power to shift
[perceptions of] the past, and by
doing so, you’ve forced the
professor to take a different view
seriously.”

Sheehan

didn’t make sense to him. He
realized that this strategy would
create tens of thousands of
American casualties. Itwould run
up costs in lives and money, and
Americans would turn on [the
war effort].

“Presidentjohnson didn’t heed
him because he could not believe
that the army generals did not
know what they were doing.

Sheehan added that General
William Westmoreland, who
headed the war effort, was “not a
liar. He deluded himself. He
believed he was winning.”

A Bright Shining Lie tells the
story of the Vietnam War through
the experiences of John Paul
Vann, a soldier that Sheehan said
personified the war effort. While
covering Vietnam in the early
1960s, Sheehan felt that Vann
was the model soldier.’However,
when he began researching
Vann’s past after his death in
1972, Sheehan found that there
were darker sides of Vann that he

did not know about.

“He was illegitimate. His mother
was a part—time prostitute. He
was a compulsive womanizer
who hurt his family and those
close to him,” Sheehan said.

“It is ironic. Vann mirrored fears
and insecurities. Qualities of good
and bad existed side by side in
this man. He became even more
of a metaphor of Vietnam.”

Sheehan said that Vietnam
ruined the presidencies of Lyndon
Johnson and Richard Nixon,
noting that he doubted that there
would have been a Watergate
scandal if Nixon hadn’t been
paranoid about the war’s effect
on his chances for re-election.

He added that he felt that the
United States was headed toward
a greater catastrophe had it not
been for Vietnam because he felt
that the checks and balances were
no longer working in the
government, and “we were
headed to an authoritarian
government in this country.”

Sheehan also said that he did
not think “you could declare a
statute of limitations on Vietnam,
even if you wanted to. We must
never forget these lessons. We
must never again play god with
another nation that wishes us no
harm and only wants to be left
alone.

“To forget Vietnam is to forget
our capacity to do evil as well as
good, and I hope that this is
unacceptable.”

Sexism and Racism:
Pitt: Students apathetic

Racism has always been a burning topic among Pitt
students ——- and judging from the suprising apathy shown
towards any attempts to lessen the tension ——- it will be for
quite a while. ‘ . I .

Aserninar on sexism and racismwas held Saturday;
however, turnout was far from satisfying to those who had
organized the meeting. . ; T

The organizers of this event had hoped to draw atten-
tion to the severe lack of blacks and women who hold

, _ important positions at Pitt. All they succeeded in drawing

attention to is the abundant apathy on the part of the
students and faculty to these problems.

Dennis Brutus, the exiled South African poet who is
chairperson of Pitt’s Black Studies Department, and

_ Manning Marable, a professor at Colorado University and
head of the Center for Studies of Ethnicity in the Americas, .
P were both on hand to speak and answer questions, along

with many other well-qualified speakers. ,
According to Marable, “The worst thing we can do to
African.American studies is to think that African American
studies is for Afro-Americans only.”
After seeing the scattering of faces -—- very few of them
black —— Derrick Darby, a graduate student in Philosophy

‘who helped to coordinate the event, expressed his utter

disapointment in the number of people he was able to
reach, while tears streamed down his face.

“What upsets me is —— look around you. There are about

63 people in this room... Is that an indication of how we
feel? It upsets me. Is it hopeless? How much of the campus
is going to know about what happened here today? I’m
not blaming anyone, but this is our world. Is it left to just
a few to decide how our world is going to be?”
I Although it may be too late to do anything about missing
this event, the University Honors College has organized
a new student group known as the Student Coalition
Against Racism and Sexism open to any interested stu-
dents. Pitt students have been given another chance to do
something about these problems — let’s not blow it this
time.

Don't go Greek, join the Scouts

“Are we allowed to wear our
letters this week?" squeaked a
giddy, bleached-blonde sorority
girl who planted herself directly
in front of me during class. I had
to restrain myself from asking her
if she was a little sister from
Lambda Lambda Lambda.

While the professor’s lecture
drowned in the ,constant.war-
bling of this girl, I sat and won-
dered if everyone exposed to

sorority life was a reﬂection of
what sat in front of me. I con-
cluded that the answer was actu-
ally yes and no.

The movie Revenge oftbeNerds
(ring any- bells?) may help to
clarify the situation. It idolized
the Greek system while simulta-
neously spray—painting obscene
graffiti all over their beloved let-

ters. That particular ﬂick of yester- ,

year could easily be mistaken as
the biography of the Greek sys-
tem today. The main theme was
acceptance, orin the case of the
Nerds, lack of acceptance.
Unfortunately, many things that
some people consider important,

such as presidential elections,’

running for Homecoming King
or Queen, or just rushing a frater-
nity or sorority are basically
popularity contests just like in
the movie. If you ’ve got the look,
you’ve got their bid. But a lot of
people just don’t have. that eye-
catching look — it takes a little
more than a few parties and a few
drinks to determine who is going
to be “in” or who is going to sit in
a corner and veg.

In today’s fast-paced world,
one doesn't have the time to

open up to everyone they meet.
Many people act differently in
front of strangers than they do in
front of friends. But Greeks have
to be quick with judgment of
character because “the last keg
just kicked, and we needanother
one. Gotta go ...”, So,,if brother
Nick thought you were cool while T
he was still conscious, you might‘
get his vote later (if he can still
remember who you are). If not,

 

well  ,

So in thatlight, you will have to
play hardball if you want in —
Personality Concentration. If you
really want a bid, you might find
a sober Greek with a personality
that matches yours -3 or you
might not. Then, of course, you
always run the risk that you won’t
fit the ideal fraternity portrait.

So I ask, why waste your hard-
earned money to buy a couple of
new “friends” in a superficial
organization? These groups base
themselves on too many outside
appearances. If you really want
to be involved in something,
invest your money in the local
troop of Boy or Girl Scouts. It’s
not half as expensive, and you
can be appreciated for your skills
at things more practical than being
the first pledge class to drink a
quarter keg dry in under 12

 Why can’t qualifications be
based on community help? “Well,
if we want community help, we’ll

recruit Rob Lowe,” ejaculates,

brother Nick. Funny — if Greeks .

worried more about local chari-
ties instead of their Alphas,’ Betas
and Phis, maybe they would be

seen in the public eye as helpful —

organizations instead of Harmful
Hazing Havens. I
“But we’ve done away with

hazing,” frat bro’ Nick barks. Ha! .

Ha! No, really, we believe you.
A university is supposed to
diversify our thinking and
broaden our horizons; that’s the
main reason we came here to the
city and didn’t attend Shunk U. in
the badlands of North Dakota.-_
The diversity of the people gath-
ered in an urban university is

attractive; at least it was to me.

So why defeat the purpose of
being unique by admitting your-
selfinto an organization that bases
qualifications on too many simi-
larities instead of individual at-
tributes? Then there's no reason
this integration should end when
you leave the classroom. lWhy
can’t it be adopted into the Greek
charters too? After all, it is legal
to spellout the letters of a new
idea ——- and you won’t even lose
your driver's license

This letter is in response to
Paul Kengor’s column, “The
Vietnamese War was the Lesser
of Two Evils,” of Oct. 5. Where is»
your sense of patriotism and
concern for domestic welfare?
The protestors of the Vietnam
War in the ’60s were not “bash-
ers” and did not “cry.” They ral-
lied for peace and expressed
concern for themselves, their

 

lent war, thousands of American
soldiers were brutally slain, and
they were not even defending
their own country. In addition,

many survivors bear permanent
physical as well as emotional
scars from such a horrible, detri-
mental experience. While it is
true that the initial U.S. intentions
were indeed noble, to avert the
spread of communism, the re-
sults of U.S. interference were
disastrous to the troops sent to
Vietnam and to the citizens of the
United‘ States who were home.

There was rampant domestic and
social turmoil in our nation, from
dissention amongst family mem-
bers, to unsettling rallies and
marches, to conﬂicts that caused
undue death, such as the killings
at Kent State. What would you
have suggested our government
do? Keep our troops in Vietnam,
allowing the slaughter of our own
to continue, while the social cli-

mate at home further deterio-
rated? It is sad that two million
Cambodians were murdered and
granted, the situation in Vietnam
is far from ideal. But it is our
government’s responsibility to
worry about the safety and well-
being of its own citizens first.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, October 9, 1989

Americans are suffering from the loss of pride

Many moons ago, our found-
ing fathers came to America with
hope in their hearts and pride in
their spirits. They fought for what
they believed‘ in —- and won.
They then worked to show that
what they’d won was worth
winning. It was a hard time, but
it was a time when you could be
proud to be an American. And

 

we were. .
Nowadays, with the Japanese
taking over our corporations and

auto dealerships and our increas-_

ing dependency on foreign prod-
ucts, America is slowly losing its
identity. Today’s generation of
statesmen is hard at work telling
us to return to homeland goods
and services. They want to usher

in a resurgence of that great
American feeling because the
truth is, we just don’t have it
anymore.

This is the age of convenience.
in America. We are _so content
with our former prestige that we
forget we have to keep working
at it. All we are concerned with
today is how to make things
easier on ourselves. We are per-
haps unsurpassed in thisrespect.
Where else but in America can
you find a product like a cereal-
box holder or, my personal
favorite, Clzﬂ’s Notes?

The malaise that has gripped

_the minds of Americans has

deeply affected our national

honor. And all the ﬂag—waving in «

the world isn’t going to get it
back. Because ﬂag-waving is part
of the problem. It’s easier to say,
“Let’s show some pride,” than to

find a way to be deserving of any.

Therein lies the problem and the

No woman as/es to be

.43,  It’s been my experience that

women — not all, but quite a few
—— are born to ﬂirt. They have the

means and ability to turn a bar

A full of men into a school of sharks
in a feeding frenzy.

Of course, much of that has to

do with the mind—set of the men.

. Still, take away the means, and

you have no end.

' But nowhere in the mating and
dating handbook does the simple
presence of a woman make her
fair game. Her perfume could
taunt a man’s nostrils to no end;
her skirt could be cut so high that
a man might think she’s all legs.
But not one man has a badge or
permit that allows him to slip an
arm around a woman, forcibly
remove her from her place of
residence and sexually assault
her. Ethically, morally and le-

gally, you just don’t do it unless

you‘ care to be branded a rapist .

and hauled off to the slammer.

 

A Broward County, Fla., jury
feels differently, however. A 26-
year-old Georgia native drifting
through Florida raped a 22-year-
old Florida woman, brandishing

.a knife on her at times. The jury
decided that her provocative A
clothing — a white—lace miniskirt ,

and bright green tank top, no
underwear —— warranted the
man’s abduction and sexual as-
sault of the woman. The jury
acquitted the man.

answer. ,

Our founding fathers meant
what they said and said what
they meant. Watch a few com-
mercials, and see if you notice
any of that trait anywhere. Also,
the pride in their country was
reﬂected in the work they did for

their country. Now, inspect some.

of today's American products.
Would you buy them? Of course
not! Not when you can get a more
reliable, more efficient and more
advanced Japanese version for
less. Our apathy has even seeped
into the most routine parts of our
careers. A recent story by The
Associated Press is - a perfect
example: I -

In Tiltonsville,‘Ohio, a leak in
a gas furnace nearly led to trag-
gedy. The harmful vapors traveled
throughthe ventilation system at
Buckeye Southwest High School
and sickened some 300 people.
Although 256 people were re-

leased after treatment, 32 were
kept overnight and three were
listed in intensive care. An inves-
tigation into the source of the

leak led to the discovery of a ’

crack in one of the four basement
furnaces. These furnaces had just
had their annual inspections in
August, and nothing was discov-
ered. Ann Stephens, Buckeye
superintendent, said, “It was in-
side the furnace. You can’t see it
without totally tearing the fur-
nace apart.” I

Well, excuse me! I thought that’s
what inspectors were supposed
to do! Assistant Fire Chief Gary
McHugh verified, “If they’d have
been in there for at least two

more hours, it could have been

worse.” He said, “A few of them

-could have died.” Try to explain V’

to some mother that the reason
her child didn’t come home‘ from
school is because somebody
didn’t feel like going that extra

9

yard to inspect the furnace ade-
quately. I bet she'd understand.
She’s an American, too. I

.With this in mind, it’s obvious

that the lack of pride in our work-
has crossed the line from some-
thing for the patriotic yahoos to

stand on their soapboxex and
preach about to something that is
dangerous and potentially fatal.
The problem cannot be ignored
any longer. It should never have
been ignored in the first place,
but now we just have to deal with
it.

In a few months, an awful lot of A

people will be graduating from

Pitt. They will become tomor- p

row’s work force. It is to them
that I direct this urgent plea. Take
pride in your work. Do what you

do to the best of your ability.‘
Give us all a reason to be proud. , , I

“We all feel [that] she asked for
it [by] the way she wasdressed,”
jury foreman Roy Diamond of
Fort Lauderdale told the Miami
Herald. “The way she was dressed
with that skirt, you could see
everything she had. She was
advertising for sex.” Her clothing
was too enticing, the rest of the
jury said.

It’s no wonder Fort Lauder-
dale, the site of the trial, is a
. popular, spring break location. If
the police act as irresponsibly as
the jury did, they could rename
the town Fort Libido.

The defense attorney told the
jury that the woman was a pros-
titute who agreed to have sex
with the man for $100_and a snort
or two of cocaine. He said the
woman went along with the man

at first but changed her-mind and
tried to back out of the arrange-
ment. «

Prostitute or not, the woman
decided she did not care to take
up with the man. He held her at
knife-point to voice his opinion
and then abducted her from a

restaurant parking lot on Nov. 6, ’

1988.

But the woman deserved it, the
jury decided. No doubt about it,
she was too darnappealing for
the man to turn away from.

As the man, now cleared on all

‘ counts in Florida, turns away

from one court case, he enters
another courtroom asthe defen-
dant in separate rape and sexual
assault cases in Georgia. Maybe
the magnolias, palms and Span-
ish moss grow a-little thicker in

ently spent too much time in the’

But they can return to their
suburban homes now, their mis-
sion accomplished. The suspected
wrongdoer was proven innocent,

Burning the ﬂag is   a Way to express our freedom H

- The American ﬂag, an icon that
represents the unity of the United

felt by Francis Scott Key's “Star
Spangled Banner,” expresses one
individual’s pride and patriotism
for this country.

In an act of adverse expressive-
ness, Gregory Johnson‘, a repre-
sentative of the Revolutionary

Qyommunist Brigade, set fire to a

:13 ' ﬂag during a political protest

outside the 1984 Republican

National Convention in Dallas.
Ironically, the flag whichjohnson
destroyed symbolically stands for
the freedom to express such
contempt for it.

As offensive as it may seem to
many, Johnson's demonstration
of desecration was ruled by the
Supreme Court in June to be a
protected form of expression.

Counteracting the Court’s rul-
ing, the House of Representa-
tives recently approved a bill that
would make such acts of ﬂag-
burning illegal. In addition to
enacting the bill, President Bush
is pushing for a constitutional
amendment that would also
protect the ﬂag.

How does one approach the
issue of ﬂag-burning? °

From a patriotic point of view,
one could argue that the flag
should be protected under a
constitutional amendment be-

cause of the sacred ideals for
which the emblem stands.

‘ A logical rebuttal that focuses
more on civil liberties than patri-
otism would be that in doing so,
freedom of expression would
come under attack, and the ﬂag’s
meaning is lost because the
people in this country are subject
to oppressive, legislative manipu-

Pitt overcomes pesky Owl defense 27-3

By Mike Rampa
Assistant Sports Editor

PHILADELPHIA, Pa. —— Even though Pitt
came out of Veterans Stadium with a
commanding 27-3 victory over the Temple
Owls on Saturday, the Panthers have still not
totally recovered from the emotional energy
expended during their spectacular come-
from— behind tie against the West Virginia
Mountaineers in Morgantown only last week.

The Panther offense was sputtering all day
as Alex Van Pelt and his usually accurate

aerial assault completed only 10 of 22 passes _

for 181 yards. Pitt tried’ to establish its running
game throughoutthe contest and Wound up
with only 165 yards on 44 carries.

“Coming off an emotional week like last
week, we didn’t prepare like we should have.
We came out ﬂat, and our running game was

5 hurting because of our mental attitude,” Van

Pelt said.

Pitt head coach Mike Gottfried was quick
to agree with his quarterback. “I’m happy to
get out of here with a win. We made a lot of
mistakes. We need to play better, and we can
play better.

“We had a very emotional ball game last
week and a very emotional game the week
before that. Our schedule is one where
there’s going to be a lot of emotion spent, but
we’ve just got to regroup and go out and
play, ” Gottfried said.

Pitt’s defense was the biggest factor in the
game as they forced six Temple turnovers,
five of which led to 20 Panther points.

Senior defensive back Robert Bradley was
chosen as the player of the game as he picked
off two passes which set up the first Panther
touchdown and a late second—quarter field
goal.

Bradley also led the team in tackles as he

brought down seven Temple players
unassisted. He was extremely pumped up
going into this game because he knew the
Temple offense would be gunning for him.

“I knew they would be coming after me,”
Bradley said.

“lThroughout the] game, they kept trying to
throw deep on me; they kept trying to set me
up for the hitch and go, butl just had to come
up and make the plays.”

The Panther defense did not seem to be as
affected as the offense by the emotional blahs
as they stalled the Temple attack 10 times and
allowed a mere three points on the day while
recording three sacks. ‘

Temple drew first blood at 6:55 of the first
period as quarterback Victor Lay, an Aliquippa,
Pa., product, led the Owls on a 12-play, 70-
yard drive which culminated with a 24-yard
field goal by kicker Bob Wright.

Steelers
improving
despite

Cincy loss

By Chris Bosak

Sports Editor

What a difference three
weeks makes. Just 621 days
ago the Pittsburgh Steelers
were beat 41-10 and were
ridiculed by the winning
team after the game.

Yesterday, in front of over

, 52,000 people in Three.

Rivers Stadium, the Steelers
proved to the same team,
the Cincinnati Bengals, that
the jokes weren’t deserved.

In fact, one or two breaks
late in the fourth quarter

‘ could have meant a Steeler

victory, instead of a 26-16
defeat.

One such break could
have occurred halfway
through the fourth quarter
when the Steelers, who
trailed 19-13 at the time,
drove inside the Bengal 20-
yard line. On a third down
play, wide receiver Derek
Hill couldn’t come up with
a Bubby Brister pass in the
end zone, so the Steelers
settled for a 54-yard ﬁeld
goal by Gary Anderson, to
draw within three points.

On the next Bengal drive,
Boomer Esiason threw to
Tim McGee along the
sideline. Steeler cornerback
Dwayne Woodruffstepped
in front of the pass and
dropped what could have
been a 42-yard interception
return for a touchdown.

But Steeler head coach
Chuck Noll doesn’t like to
look back at what could
have been.

“You can play the ‘what-
if’ game if you want to, but
that’s not reality and you try
to stick with reality. The
reality is where we are right

’Brotl9erZy love’ Temple at distant cousin to winning teams  

By Ed Kuznik
Staff Writer

At least Temple can see light at the end
of the tunnel.

Owl coach Jerry Berndt and his players
were not exactly enamored with Pitt’s 27-

3 victory at Philadelphia’s Veterans Stadium 5

on Saturday afternoon, but compared to
the previous portions of the season in
general and last week in particular, the
game against the Panthers was almost like
a victory.

“A lot of people didn’t think that we
even deserved to be on the same field with
Pitt, but I think we did,” Berndt said after
the contest. “I think that we at least proved
to ourselves that if we cut out some of

these mental mistakes that we have a
chance to win.”

Berndt was referring to five turnovers
which led to 20 Pitt points and took the
hosts totally out of contention for an
upset.

But when looking at last week’s contest,
Berndt had to be thrilled that his squad did
not give the scoreboard operator a heart
attack from overexertion. Last week,
Houston quarterback Andre Ware threw
for 467 yards and seven touchdowns
against the Owls defense in a 65-7
demolition of Temple.

Temple held Pitt to 346 total yards in
the game; and an offense which had been
outscored 20465 in its first five games
actually showed signs of moving the ball

against Pitt’s powerful defense. In fact,
Temple had three more first downs than
the Panthers.

In short, there could have been an
extremely competitive game if the Owls
had not handed the ball to the Panthers
and let Henry Tuten and Reggie Williams
get behind their secondary for two first-
half touchdown passes from Alex Van
Pelt.

“Our coach told us that this one game
was the first game of the season for us,”
said Temple running back Ventres
Stevenson, who rushed for 69 yards on
Saturday. “I feel a lot better compared to
what we did last week. This was the
number eight team in the country, and
they didn’t play the way I expected them

‘players for taking a sigh of relief that they _

to — the thing that just hurt us was the
turnovers. Other than that, we were in the
same category as they were today.”
That may be stretching things just a
little, but you will have to forgive Temple

now. It wasn't much of a fun day
for us," Noll said.

If it was a fantasy world, the
Steelers would probably like to
take back the last two minutes of
the game. On the first play after
the two-minute warning Cincy
running back James Brooks beat
a Steeler blitz and took a third
and 27 play 65 yards . for a
touchdown to put the game out
of reach.

“It was an off-tackle play. When
we called it, the linebacker went

on the other side. I told the wide

receiver if he can stop one strong
safety, I can deal with the other
one. We talked about it before
the play happened and it worked
just right,” said Brooks.

before the injury.

But Pittsburgh’s offense was
led by its running game. Tim
Worley and Merril Hoge
combined for 142 yards rushing.

“We’re very confident that we
can run the ball on anybody,”
said Steeler tackle Tunch Ilkin.
“There’s nothing better for an
offensive line than to be able to

‘run the ball. Bubby and the

coaches did an outstanding job
calling plays. It was just a tough
hard—nosed game”,

The Steelers took an early lead
in the game when Brister hit
Rodney Carter on a 22-yard
touchdown pass.

“I got around the defender and

when I“ turned, the ball was

already in the air,” said Carter. “It

came to play. They’re good
players and have a lot of pride.”

The touchdown drive was set
up by a Rod Woodson fumble
recovery. Woodson hit Cincy
running back Eric Ball and caused
the fumble before he pounced
on it.

Woodson gave the Steelers
good field position all day with
his kickoff returns. He averaged
over 30 yards per return, including
a 45—yarder in the second quarter.

The Pitt defense gave Lay 18 of
his yards on the drive as they

. amassed a late hit and an

unintentional face mask penalty.
The consecutive infractions gave
Lay two first downs in Pitt territory.
However, Lay could not put the
ball in the end zone from the Pitt
16-yard line and had to settle for
three.

No harm i done as the
homecoming crowd of 24,362
was to see all the scoring of its

afternoon. V '

On Temple's second drive of

his first pass and returned it nine

[Van Pelt went to the air and hit

Henry Tuten in the end zone on
an outstanding catch which Tuten
juggled in the air before gaining
possession and hitting the turf.
Pitt went up 7-3 as Van Pelt threw
only two passes in the entire first
period.

Temple was driving in the
beginning of the second quarter,
only to wind up with a missed
field goal attempt by Wright from
37 yards out. .

Pitt took over on its own 20-

1, Pitt decided to go for the; 1

touchdown. Van Pelt proceeded
with a play-action fake to Adam
Walker which fooled about
everyone in the stadium,
including the TV cameramen.
Walker dove into the end zone,
drawing nearly every Temple
player to the tackle, and Huebner
scooted over to the left corner of

the end zone’ where Van Pelt

dished him the pass forthe score.

And that was all the scoring to
be done for the day as Pitt won
27-3. -

Gottfried may have been lucky
to" walk away from Veterans
Stadium with a win because of
last week’s emotional game with
the Mountaineers,
Virgina head coach Don Nehlen
was not as fortunate on his home
turf against Virginia Tech.

Nehlen admitted the game
against Pitt was a major factor in
his team’s recent defeat. “You
know, that game last week was a
beating. We were practicing
Wednesday, and everyone
[players and coaches] was still
talking about the Pitt game, and
you just can’t go into the nexg
game like that,” Nehlen said.’

Thus, it looks. as if Pitt has
overcome the psychological
torture and gained a new
psychological advantage as a
result. The Panthers face Navy
this week for Pitt’s homecoming.

Will the Panthers make the
same mistake of not being

opponent?

“I guarantee you we won’t,”
Van Pelt said.

NOTES: Ed Frazier was perfect

in PAT s and field goals, gﬁing,

three for three on his extra points
and two for two in field goals. His
longest was from 32 yards out.

Reggie Williams caught the
longest pass of the day for 38
yards and a touchdown. Henry
Tuten led in receiving yardage
with 89 on the day.

Van Pelt was 10 for 22, with 181
yards and three touchdowns and
no interceptions.

Temple’s Victor Lay complete!
21 of 38 passes for 199 yards, no
touchdowns and three
interceptions.

Adam Walker led the Panthers
in the rushing department with
82 yards on 13 attempts. Walker
also had the longest run of the
day, a 17-yarder. Henry Tuten
did not fare so well on Pitt’s only

reverse attempt of the day as hag

gained only three. Curvin Richards
had 54 yards on 1.4 rushes.

Brian Greenﬁeld averaged 35
yards per punt, and his longest
was a 45-yarder.

Robert Bradley had my

Stevenson said, “Its been
rough because the fans are
demanding,” Stevenson said.
“You hear a lot of things like ,‘Oh

practicing for — so you can just
get killed again?’ That's in
classrooms and around the
campus, but thatisthe way it is.
Everyone loves a winner
regardless of anything else.

“A lot of people make these
kind of comments, and I get
uptight about that sometimes. I
just brush it off, though.

0 “I just want to run around and
bash some people in the face, but

   

how is that going to look? That
would make even more
problems.”

So Stevenson, Bemdt and the
entire Temple program simply
grit their teeth and look forward
to what they hope will be a far
better second half of the season.

“We’re looking forward to
playing Boston College next
week. We’re looking for a definite
win there.

“We believed all day long,
and we played hard all day long.
Before we went out for the game

‘today, we had a real nice

We said that we have nothing to
lose, and we just pulled together.
We’re going to stay like that for
the rest of the season." .

Maybe Cosby should have
launched into one of his famous
comedy routines for Berndt,
whose face was as pale as the
white walls in Temple’s press
room after the game. V

“I can't be anything else but
optimistic. If I’m not optimistic,
then the kids won’t be optimistic.
We’re just going to get ready to
play Boston College tomorrow,”

“I know what its like to not get

' any work for awhile and all of a

sudden you get work,” said
Blackledge. “I understand that
role, I’ve been there before. You
have to stay prepared as a back-
up.”

Blackledge has over 5,000
career yards passing, while
completing 49 Percent of his
attempts. ,

Buck was called for a personal
foul following the play that hurt
Brister, which brought up
accusations that it could have
been a cheap shot.

“All that happened is [the tackle]
grabbed me by the shoulder and
yanked me down. I got spun out
and I hit him with my back. I was

, out of control on that,” said Buck.

“I've never been involved in a
cheap shot in my life. I play
football with total class and I
don’t accept that, not at all.”

Cincinnati head coach Sam
Wyche defended his defensive
end.

“That was not a cheap shot by
Jason Buck and it was not even a
penalty. When that is reviewed,
they’ll see that the left tackle
threwjason into the quarterback,”
said Wyche. “The tackle wasn’t
doing that on purpose either, but
this was not a defensive lineman

0 going after a quarterback. I hate

like hell that it happened, he’s a
fine player and a fine person, but
that’s part of the game.’’.

Brister completed 19 of 51 yards
for 169 yards, including a 22-yard
touchdown, before the play.
