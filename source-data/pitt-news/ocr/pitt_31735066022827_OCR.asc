The issues in Harrisburg concern- .

appropriations to Pitt and other
state-related institutions are not at
all concerned with higher education
according to Dr. Wesley Posvar,
Pitt’s chancellor. '

But what is concerned with the
cuts in appropriations is a $41
million budget deﬁcit for which
Governor Thornburgh failed to
raise ‘enough funds to reduce. The

deﬁcit was created when the Liquor -

on price increases, or a 10-cent-a-

said at Monday’s Senate council
meeting. “As a matter of fact there

and unanimously in the Senate.

“Ane the leadership of both par-
ties is very concerned, very anxious

ed. _ ' _

Posvar also cited “a political
fight going on,” and. “the desire to
embarrass the administration.”

Smith Assigned Commuter Services’

By CLARE GLEASON

- Pitt News Staff Writer

The vice chancellor for student
affairs has reassigned the duty of
establishing an offiC€"f0f C°mmU1¢1'
services to the director of student
acitvities as of July 10.

The original proposal for this
ofﬁce was drafted by Mary Lou
Sasso, director of Off-Campus
Housing, in the office of special
student services under the student
affairs division. Sosso’s proposal
entitled “The Need for an Office of
Commuter Services at The Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh" was “deferred”
according to Dr. Conney Kimbo.
vice chancellor for student affairs,
for further review until the

. required Planning Resource Man-

agement Information Systems
(PRMIS) proposal can be drafted to
requisition the necessary funding
for the offiice."“‘" '3 ""

S_osso's proposal “will be fully
considered when a more concrete
proposal is drafted,” according to

Robert G. Houston, executive assis-
tant for student‘ affairs. ,

“I feel moving into Student
Activities will put the proposal
closer to the Commuter Affairs
Committee (CAC) of the Student
Government Board (SGB) because
Smith works closely withthe SGB.
Until we can get funding for this
office we have a larger staff to deal
with these problems,” Kimbo said.

Glenn Walsh, special commuter
advocate for SGB, believes there is
an immediate need for a permanent
ofﬁce for commuters that would
ensure continuity as opposed to the
present system that depends on
student‘ volunteers. Walsh ques-
tioned whether student affairs has
the “quality and quantity of time
and resources to supportthe needs
of commuters effectively.”

Walsh disagrees with the defer-
ral and postponement of the offices

’dicts will occur in the next fiscal
year. Walsh said the matter

Prof Appointed To Minority Panel

By DIANE R. POWELL '

Pitt News Staff Writer

A Pitt professor was recently ap-
pointed to the College Board’s Ad-
visory Panel on Minority Concerns
and he is the recipient of an $8,000
Spencer Fellowship. .

‘Dr. Lloyd Bond, assistant pro-
fessor of psychology and research
associate at Pitt’s Learning
Research and Development Center
(LRDC), was ‘one of ten persons

‘ named t9 the College Board’s Panel

on Minority Concerns to serve a
three-year period. ‘

The panel is comprised of pro-
officials,
students and parents representing—-
black, Hispanic. oriental and native
American minority groups.
Members were chosen from
Cleveland, Baltimore, New York
and several other cities.

The purpose and function of the
panel is to advise the College Board
on the educational, needs of
minorities and the College Board’s
role in addressing those needs
through research, recruitment,
financial aid services, professional
training opoportunities and ongo-
ing and developing programs and

. v 4 J a u a r 4 . .

According to College Board
President George ‘ Haaford, the
panel “is a renewed commitment

, toward strengthening minority in-

volvement and improving programs
and services for the minority
population.’ ’

Bond said the panel
established to allow an “informed
point of view” and to allow people
“external to the College Board” to

- have some input and to recommend

some direction for the future.

‘‘It -is my belief that this panel
grew out of a concern with the
California l.Q. test and college en-
trance test. Many felt these tests
were biased against minorities,"
Bond said.

The panel will meet twice a year,
“to recommend programs of
research involving alternative cri-
teria for the admission of minority
students to college,” said Bond.

Around the same time Bond was
informed of his appointment to the
panel, he was also informed of his
selection as one of the five 1980 Na-
tional _ Academy of Education's
Spencer Fellowship recipients.
Bond was chosen with four others
out of more than sixty applicants.

The fellowship, in the amount of
$8,000, is . aid in the.form.of a

grant to the recipients’ home in-
stitution. The grant is to be used
over a three-year period to assist the
fellow in the field of education.
Criteria for the fellowship is pro-
mise as a scholar and not more than
five years past the Ph.D. degree. It

was created to encourage outstan-'

ding young researchers at the post
doctoral level to.pursue research on
topics related to education.

‘‘I know. that I will use it to at-
tend conferences, travel purposes
and for some equipment and maybe
a portion for students to help me
with my research, but I've got three
years to think about it,” Bond said.

Bond is the second person at
LRDC ‘to be awarded a Spencer
Fellow. -In 1978, Dr. Michele_ne
Chi-Chase, research associate, was
awarded a fellowship.

Bond received a B.A. degree in
Psychology from Hillsdale College
and M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in
Psychology from John Hopkins
University. He joined the Pitt
faculty in 1976. In addition to his
work at Pitt, Bond serves as consul-
tant to "organizations such as the
National Urban League, and the
Minority Caucus of Drug and

The deadline for students to
remove personal information from
Pitt’s “In House Directory,” an in-
formation source on students,
through the “Privacy Rights of
Parents and Students Act,” is July
21, 1980. “‘

The “Privacy Act of 1974” also .
known as the “Buckley Amend-
ment” guarantees the students’
rights of access to personal medical,
academic and financial records and
the protection of them from misuse.

All records containing a student's
personal information are to be
maintained in a manner that
prevents their availability to “peo-
ple who don’t have a right or need
to know them,” according to prac-
ticing attorney’ Pat Capolupo.

The “In House Directory” will

Office, with the campus police and

would build support for whatever
difficult steps they had to take,”
Posvar said. , -

Posvar attempted to instill a
sense of confidence into the
members of the Council, urging
members not to “suffer profound
condem or loss of faith in the in-
stitution.

“This is a very strong institution
and we’re going to make it, even if
the situation gets very bad.”

Posvar emphasized that the
“prime concern” in any program of

austerity would be to protect the

compensation of faculty and staff,

and he cited “parallel concerns” to

protect‘ the students and minimize
tuition increases.

coordinator of the campus judicial
system. . v

The directory ,is needed by the
campus police, for instance, “when
there is an emergency and a parent
wants to get in touch with a
student.” '

The Buckley Amendment covers

A the release of personal information

permission is not‘ needed by Pitt
staff or faculty to gain access to stu-
dent records. ~

“If your professor wanted to see
your transcript for legitimate
educational reasons he could,” said

to know who has seen his records;
therefore, “All requests for infor-
mation are documented by the

Lovers Leaping From Six Thousand FeeiAbovei

By NICK ARNETT
Pitt News Staff Writer

SOMEWHERE ON THE WEST
COAST——I was six thousand feet
above sea level, but only the last
hundred and twenty mattered. That
was the distance I would fall if I
didn’t find something secure to
grab or stand on. Below me was
talus—hundreds of sharp pieces of
granite. I was clinging to a sheer
rock wall, Lover’s Leap, in the
California Sierra. My climbing
rope was hanging uselessly from my
waist. There were three hundred
feet of rock above me and a reluc-
tant partner below. My right hand
was clutching a narrow crack and
my left toes-were balanced on a very
thin ledge. The rest of me was try-
ing to fall. ‘ ‘

Lover’s Leap is the side of a
mountain abouta half-mile long
with almost 34 established climbing
routes. Three of them are closed to
preserve an eagle’s nest. Although
it’s sumnier, there’s snow on many
of the surrounding mountains. As
it melts, it forms cascading streams
which look like white ribbons cour-
sing through the granite. ’

' An enthusiastic salesman in a
mountaineering store told my
roommate and I about the Leap and
we decided it might be less crowded
than other areas ‘on the Fourth of
July. We drove from our apartment
near San Francisco afterwork the
day before and arrived in the dark.
Some folks in a nearly lodge said we
could camp anywhere in their
woods. _We unrolled our sleeping
bags under tall pine trees near the
American River and tried to sleep.

The river was shallow but fast-
running. ‘ Its
soothing. The sky looked darker

 than -usual, the stars were brighter
and twinkling less. I guessed it was .

due to the altitude and clarity of the
air. I smiled under my tree, a grin
so big it would have embarrassed
me had anyone seen it. My chest
felt tight, perhaps it was the lower
air pressure,Zmaybe the chill. I snif-
fed the air. Sometimes there wa§a'

. strong pine scent, but the air~—seem-

ed clean. It occurred to me that this

rumbling was —

was a cliche-the kid enjoying
the clear country air. I smiled
anyway.

My sleeping bag narrowed at my
feet and felt confining. It reminded
me of sharing a narrow bed which
made me recall a woman I’d hardly
met who I hadn’t wanted to leave in
Pittsburgh. I fell asleep remember-

ping another cliche—holding each
other on a cool spring night, look-
ing at the stars over Oakland. We
said goodbye for the summer and
hoped we "wouldn’t change too
much so things could be the same
in the fall.

Bright sunlight reflecting off a
mountain woke me. I could see

.horses through the pines and the

river was still rumbling. The air was"
‘ chilly and I was sure I’d be cold

when I left my sleeping-bag. My
roommatesfs bag was wiggling
‘ about thirty feet away and I knew
he was awake. I rolled over and
saw the Leap through the trees.
Pointing to the immense rock wall,
I grinned at my climbing partner.
He smiled and said, “That’s the
' first thing I saw.”

We changed clothes quickly, our
hands stiff from the chill. It was a
short drive to a parking area near
the Leap, then we hiked up an old
jeep trail. A few minutes later we
met another climber who asked us
where we were going to climb.
When we said it was all new to us,

I he recommended the East Face
climb. '

“I’ve done it seven times and I’ll
do it _seven more,” he said.

We wished him good climbing
and headed down the road, to East
Face. We arrived at the base about
eight o’clock. My partner set up a
be1ay—a safety siystem—and I
began to lead the climb. It was
tougher than I expected until I
relaxed and began to feel warm. In
about 45 minutes I was at the first
ledge, 140 feet up. I couldn't

understand what my partner was ’

yelling, so«I tied myself off and
climbed down a little. He had
decided he wasn’t ready to climb
the big wall. _

After a brief discussion, I decided

l

sea \LeveIl

 

it would be foolish to try to talk him

. into it, so I began to climb down. I
doubled the rope around a’ secure-
looking tree stump on the ledge and
went down about 75 feet. When I
stopped on a narrow rock near the

_ end of the rope, I discovered I
couldn’t pull the rope down. I had
to climb back up to the ledge and
retrieve it. .

Climbing down with the rope, I
had to protect myself from falling
by putting nylon slings around rock
horns. Climbers call such slings
runners. There were plenty of horns
most of the way, but just above an
especially smooth part, the only
horn was gently rounded-—-not the
sort of thing I’d trust my life to, but
I clidn’t think I had a choice.

About halfway down the twelve-

'. foot smooth part, I put some weight

on the rope—-I think I had slipped a
little. The sling, my rope, and the
hardware which held them together
fell into my face. In climbing

;' jargon, that stuff was my»pl'0-

tec'tion,—until it "fell. ,
Iremember telling myself I had to
relax. If I tensed, I'd lose what lit-
tle friction I had with my left toes.
With my free left hand, I worked
the sling around a more secure
horn. When I had it safely in place,

I clipped myself into it three ways. I
still didn't want to fall on it, so I
dug my right hand into a tiny
depression and somehow "pulled
myself up.

With the sling on the lower horn,
climbing down was easy and I re-
joined my partner about three
o’clock in the afternoon. When I
explained what had happened, I
realized the reason I’d used the

smooth horn was ﬁnancial. I didn't
want to leave the sling in a place
where I wouldn’t be able to get it

back. For a piece of nylon worth a

$1.50, I nearly fell 120 feet.

Crime Report

Nine dorm size refrigerators were
stolen from the lounge in McCor-
mick Hall sometime over the
weekend of July 11. There was no
apparent forced entry. The
estimated loss was $810.

A 1977 Ford truck had its win-
dow smashed in the Y lot on Dar-
raugh Street on July 8. An
estimated $850 worth of camera
equipment, fishing rods, and a
Panasonic radio were taken.

On July 9 at 5:40 p.m. a Tower B
elevator got stuck beween ﬂoors.
Paramedics were called when one of
the 16 passengers lost consciousness
in the elevator. The medics
evacuated the elevator through a

T 14-inch space between the top of

Finally, the Supreme Court has
made a ruling’ reinforcing press
_ freedom and the people’s right to

know. The high court, by a 7-1’

vote, decided July 2 that the public
and press have a constitutional right
to attend criminal trials.

Up until this recent case, the
Supreme Court had made three
decisions which placed ‘ restraints

‘ «and obstacles on journalists and
' .. their reporting.

The recent deci-
sion, however, tells judges nation-
wide they can conduct trials or por-
tions of trials in secret only as a last

’ v.’ _.

. ~.h

Previously, the high court had
ruled that public figures suing for
libel may inquire into a journalist’s
“state of mind” and the editorial
process behind an allegedly libelous
statement; ruled that police have
the right to obtain a warrant and
make unannounced searches of
private property—particularly
newsrooms—to look for evidence
of a crime; and ruled that “The
Progressive” could not publish an
article that included adescription of
the design of a hydrogen bomb. All
three decisions are a definite threat
to press freedom and the people’s
right to know. -

The new ruling reaffirms the

olumn/Peoples RightTo Know:

decision stems from a 1978 murder
trial in Virginia where a judge clos-
ed the proceedings “because I don’t
want any information being shuffl-
ed back and forth when we have a
recess as to what—who testified to
what.”

Two reporters from the Rich-
mond Times Dispatch and the
Richmond News-Leader were
ordered to leave the courtroom, and
their employer, Richmond
Newspapers, Inc., sued and
challenged the action. The Virginia
Supreme Court upheld the judge’s
decision, but the recent Supreme
Court ruling overturns Virginia’s
high court.

the nature of a disaster averted than

a great victory won.” Saying that
the high court has only upheld the
inherent public nature of trials
themselves, he adds that “still very
much under attack by some at-
torneys and judges is the inherent
public nature of pretrial pro-
ceedings—the arraignments, the
hearings, the motion sessions that
precede the formal courtroom pro-
ceedings. . .” The same guarantees
that these proceedings will be open
to the press and the public have not
been made.

It is important that these pretrial
hearings also be open because this is
when the vast majority of plea bar-

small percentage of these cases ever I‘)
actually reaches the formal trial‘ '

stage that it is important for the
public and the press to be allowed
to ascertain that the administration
of justice has been conducted fairly. «
Even though the recent ruling is
welcomed, it is still disappointing to
know that such a decision to reaf-
firm press freedom and the people’s
right to know had to go all the way
to the Supreme Court. The ad-
ministration of justice should be
under the scrutiny of the public and
the press, and the challenges to this
right are frightening and present a
grave danger for a public which
demands the right to know.

When asked about possible con-
'frontations between postal workers
and anti-draft protesters, Lynn said
he had already considered the
‘ possibility and had cautioned the

regional CARD offices.

" ‘‘I talked to the president of the
postal clerks union and the‘General
Counsel of the Postal Service and I
made clear that we have tried to let
people understand what the regula-
tions are,.at least for the post of-
fices.” Lynn said.

“We’ve also tried to make it clear
that peoples’ hostility to the Selec-
tive Service is, not supposed to rub
off on postal employees. We do
what we can, but we can't

_, guarantee that problems aren’t go-

ing to emerge because of some
hos_t_ility or confrontations,” Lynn

added. .
it was agreed by both l-Ieeterman

and Lynn that civil disobedience
and the breaking of any laws is up
to the individual, but the practice is
not frowned upon. A

“We can't tell anybody what they
should or shouldn't do. . but we’re
encouraging people of any age or
sex. to be involved in civil disobe-

. dience and to attempt nonviolently ‘

to disrupt and protest, the whole
regT”st.ration.~ »proeess,,’”’ I-leeterrnan
said, explaining such actions were a
..“"crirtiieal part in opposition to regis-
trationb.."'

“"CAR'~.D dloesn"t urge people to
break any laws at all. At  con-
ferences we had a workshop on 
ﬁsohedlience and we explained all
that. But we don’t promote it in
that sense,” Lynn 

Looking ahead to the future,
Lynn said he anticipated a return to
the draft sometime next‘ year,
the Carter administration

has made assurances that registra-
tion is all that is planned. I

“I think there certainly are going
to be efforts next year to bring back
the draft,” Lynn said. “The ques-
tion is- how serious. I think it
depends on what happens with the
hostages, and whether Carter is
desperate enough to start a war in
order to possibly reassure his
weakening re-election. If we can
get through October without a war,
I think we can get through to 1981
without a draf .”

(Editor's note: following, in ques-

tion and answer form, is vital infor-

mation for registrants)

Q. When will registration begin? ,

A. The registration program will

take place during the two-week

period beginning on Monday, July

2], and concluding on Saturday,

August 2.

Q. Who is required to register?

A. All men born in the years~l960

and i961 must register. The only

persons not required to register are

nonirnmi-grant aliens (for example,

members of diplomatic or trade

missions and those on student or

visitor's visas), members of the ac-

tive armed forces, and cadets or

mildshiprnert at the service
academies. All others are required
to register.

0. Where and what special times
during the two-week period must
individuals register’!

A. At each of the 34,000 post of-
fices in the country during normal
business hours. Men born in 1960
should register during the first
week. Those born in 1961 should
register during the second week. In
addition, specific days of each week
have been assigned for registering.

individuals depending upon the
month in which they were" born, in
order to avoid long lines at post"of-
fices. Men born in January,
February, or March should register
on Monday. Men with birthdays in
April, May, or June should register
on Tuesday. Those with July,

August, or September birthdays _

should register on Wednesday. And
men born during October,
November, or December should
register on Thursday. Friday (all
day) and Saturday morning are
make-up times for those who can-
not register on the day indicated by
their birth dates.
Q. Give me an example. When
would I be required to register if my
birthday happened to be on August
22, 1961? '
A. Your registration day would be
Wednesday, July 30. If for some
reason you were unable to register
on that day, then Friday, Aug. 1, or
Saturday morning, Aug. 2, would
be your make-up day. You will not
be turned away if you appear on
another day however.
Q: What if I am 18 years old now,
but will turn 19 years old in the fall?
Should I wait until my birthday to
register?
A. You should register this summer
along with everyone else who was
born in 1960 and 1961. Your year of
birth is the de_termining factor, not
your age when registration takes
place.
Q. What is involved in registration?
A. The registrant simply reports to
any postal clerk and request the
brief registration form. ‘He then
completes the form with the re-
quired information at the post of-
fice and returns the form to any
postal clerk. The clerk checks the
form to ensurethat ithasibeen filled

out legibly and completely. and
returns it to the registrant to be
signed and dated. The postal clerk
then checks some standard form
with the cancellation stamp of the
post office. and the registration
process is complete. - '
Q. What happens next? A
A. The information is forwarded to
the Selective Service System and
placed in computers. Approximate-
fly 90 days after registering, each
registrant is mailed an acknow-
ledgement letter which includes the
information entered into the com-
puter. 'If the information is inac-
curate, the correct information
should be recorded on an enclosed
change of information form and
mailed to the Selective Service.
Q. Can an individual who is re-
quired to register send someone else
to- register for him?
A. No. Each individual
register in person.
Q. Are military reservist or
members of the National Guard re-
quired to register?
A. Yes, if they were born in 1960 or

must

1961 and are not on active duty.
Q. It is unlikely that disabled or

handicapped individuals would be ‘

drafted into the military service.
Are they ‘required to register? _
A. Yes. An individual’s physical
condition has no bearing on the re-

quirement to register. Those confin- ,

ed to’ institutions are required’ to.
register upon release from conﬁne-<
ment. _ ‘

Q. What provisions are being made

forethose who wish to register as

conscientious objectors?

A. The determination of a

registrant's classification is made by

members of his local draft board.

Because the local boards are not in '

an active status at- this time,. no
classifications of any type are being
issued to registrants. Therefore,

those who consider themselves con- -

scientious objectors are required to
register. If they wish, they may
write “CO” on their registration
forms. Such action will not in-
validate the registrations, nor will it
confirm conscientious
status on the individuals.

first of its kind inthe United States.

Allegheny County Soccer Coor-
dinator, Chris Wright, decided to
create this mini-soccer Olympics for
the Allegheny County fans. Wright,
who was hired by the county Parks
and Recreation Department first
began to conjure up the idea of an

international tournament that

would unite these youngsters in a
game that is sweeping the country.
It has already swept the rest of the
world so‘Wright is seeing just what

he and “Allegheny 80” can do to ‘

put Western Pennsylvania on that
map of soccer greats. In fact, when
Wright was hired, his long term
goal was set down. to make
Allegheny County the number one
soccer area in the United States.
And so the birth of “Allegheny
80.”
““‘Allegheny 80’ shall prove to be
a showcase for youth soccer,”
Wright said. “There will be a very
high level pf quality soccer being
played for two weeks that area en-
thusiasts will have the opportunity
to see.” i

There are some very impressive
credentials that the 28 teams field.
For example, a team from

Scotland, called Ayr Boswell has
several players with professional
contracts awaiting them in their
homeland upon their return. A
similar situation is found on all the
European teams. After “Allegheny
80” these boys will soon become
16-year-old professionals—some-
thing not at all unusual for‘Euro-
pean youths.

Turning professional as a

youngster is a reason that Wright‘

thinks that “Allegheny 80” will be
so important for all teams involved,
especially local ones.

Since Wright took his position,
youth soccer registration has grown
from only 2,000 to nearly 'l5,000.
Wright hopes to see that figure rise
to 20,000 by the end of 1980. But
now that the registration has risen,
local soccer officials and enthusiasts
believe it is time to step back and
look at just how far the area has
progressed in the style and quality
of play. A reevaluation time for
local teams shall be a part of
“Allegheny 80.” '

“We are certainly beginning to
show the Western Pennsylvania

area what soccer is all about,”,

Wright said. “We know that we
have ‘made strides, now we must
reevaluate just what those have
been. We can use this competi-
tion to gauge our play.”

B)’ DYLAN WILLIAMS

A favorite quote of producer
David Brown is “The safest way to
produce a hit movie is to take a
chance.” This is from the man who
produced two of the top ten money
making movies of all time,- Jaws
and The Sting. He feels that his
latest movie, The Island, despite
author Peter Benchley’s attraction, '
is alsoua chance. “Firstoff,” said
the 64-year-old producer and part-
ner of Richard Zanuck, “Jaws was
an incredible chance. We were deal-
ing with a mechanical fish and we
were expecting people to be scared.

V There was every possibility we

could have been laughed off the

screen. The Sting was a chance
because - at any moment people
could have seen through the com-
plicated plot and discerned that
those really weren’t real FBI agents
and so on. If they would have got-
ten onto the idea of the picture, the
picture would have been over. The

Island outrages a lot of people who_

have seen it. We get two kinds of
.. reactions from audiences. Some
people will «storm out of the theatre
after the first 17 or 18 minutes and
say they've had enough; it’s too
violent. Other people will think it’s
gross, though kids will frequently
like it. It’s either a love it or a loathe
it kind of movie and we knew that
going into it. We’ve found» that

most of the older people who like
the movie like for the filmmaking

itself, butthey find the violence is

very rough and disturbing. We had
one person who passed out during
one of the previews because ‘of
shock. So it’s a chance in that it’s a
well-made movie that you wouldn’t
recommend to either your parents
or your five-year-old brother.”
That leaves only one group, as"
Mr. Brown says, leaning back with
his martini and cigar, “The only au-
dience for movies is the younger
crowd, yo/ung adults and young
dating couples. Now we could have
copped out and made it a PG
movie, a Disney type of movie. But
then we wouldn’t have had the ef-

fect of the story we wanted to-

make. So we realized that we nar-
rowed our audience, although in the
process we achieved the same effect
that was in the book.”

One thing the young"”c"'rdwd en-
joys, as well David Brown, is the
movie’s use of stunts. The ‘most
notable stunt in the film is the ac-
tual wreck of an old DC-3 on an
island. “First of all you have to get
an old DC-3. Then you have to get a
stunt pilot who is willing to risk his
neck, as well as his life, to fly it. In
this case the pilot was a man by the
name of Dean Englehardt. Then
you put about ten cameras around,
hoping you can get a shot, taking a
chance on that one event, knowing
that you may not be able to try. it

Alley Cats Out Punk Pgh.

THE ALLEY CATS/COMBO
TAC'I‘IC

The Decade

June 30, 1980

By SAM MATTHEWS

Punk is alive and well and living
in Los Angeles these days. With
hardcore extremists like the Germs
and X around, new wave wimpouts
(i.e., 20/20 or the Pop) tend to stay
in their place. However, most of the
hardcore bands don’t have con-
tracts with major record labels yet
(unlike the latter), and are forced to
play the limited amount of clubs
that will have them. The Alley Cats,
who made a Monday night Decade
appearance recently, are no excep-
tion. After three years of constant
81881118 and ‘having various songs
released on sampler albums, the
Alley Cats finally got an opportuni-
ty to tour the American heartland-
hence a Pittsburgh appearance.
As a power trio, the Alley Cats

throughout the night, drummer Mc-

inspired bashing since Sex Pistol

encore to cap the final set.

again. Or, what’s worse, sometimes
these things come out of film as be-
ing so tame that they don’t even ap-
pear to be a crash. Now, that pilot
took a chance. But he took no more
of a chance than the man who
jumped off the schooner or the man
who walked around with his hair on
fire.”

Along with stunts, the producer
feels another element is essential in
making a good suspense film.
“Comedy,” he says with a smile,
naturally. David Brown used to
write comedy years back, and he
still feels that it is important in his
movies. “Jaws had many funny
episodes in it, and so does this ﬁlm.
They're primarily used as a type of
relief or irony, and the ’ve been.
used for centuries. or in-
stance, in the ﬂying scene, we have
the flying ‘Maynard and his son in
the plane -along with a pet pig. It’s a

very funny scene. And after they

crash and barely escape with their
lives, they’re greeted by a guard
who demands twenty dollars from
them. They ask what for and he
says it’s for landing fees.”

David Brown enjoys talking
about the good old days and about
youth as much as he does his own
success in films. “The youth is very
important to the film industry,” he
says, “They always have been. I
noticed a drastic change my own
movie-going habits once I turned
20. I started to go less and less. It
wasn't until I was older and actually
became involved in film that I
started going to movies again. But
even going to movies has changed
since I was a kid. It used to be that
movie theaters had reserved seats.
But now kids don’t want to do that
anymore. They’d wait out in the
snow because there is something
about the total movie going ex-
perience that fascinates ‘people. Me
too.”

As he tours around the world do-
ing interviews for his movie, David
Brown sees a variety of censureship
at the theaters. “The English, for
example, are more inclined to have
sex in films than violence. In
America, for some strange reason,
people are more sensitive about sex
and less about violence. Some
countries won’t show a film if it’s
too pro-American. Others won’t
show it for the opposite reason.
There are many different cultures
out there and each one reacts
differently to the same film.” Be
that as it may, THE ISLAND? As
David Brown sees.it, is a chance
that can go either way, though it’s
a chance he has gladly taken.

ucer:i Taking Chances

THE ISLAND
Directed by Michael Ritchie
Written by Peter Benchley

By DYLAN WILLIAMS

Only in the summer, when minds
grow mushy form the heat, and lack
of school" work makes the
youngsters idle and ‘undisciplined,
could a film like The Island even
have a chance. The film is obviously
banking on the young crowd who,
with both time and money to waste,
looks for a socially acceptable way
to get their stagnant brains
stimulated and functional. A good
dose of violence down at the local
theater usually. does the trick. It
recharges their minds, so therefore
they are satisfied and go home to
tell their mushy-brained ‘ friends
what a great film it is, who in turn
take their grass-cutting money and
go to the theater, etc. Thus, a movie
like The Island becomes somewhat
of a summer success.

Fortunately ' for the country,
though, and unfortunately for The
Island, there are people who don’t
find * violence xfor violence’s sake
very enjoyable. [Thank goodness
there are also people who.are not
necessarily inﬂuenced by the name

‘Peter Benchley, who, after flaws '

and The Deep has really hit the pits,
though he’d prefer to call it “the
depths.” These people will make
sure, at least, that the movie
doesn’t return for a rerun next sum-
mer.]

It’s hard to decide whether
Benchley had a neck or a gun fetish
in this story. As Maynard the
reporter- (played admirably by
Michael Caine) and his son Justin
(played by the brattyxleffrey Frank)
find an island of pirates who have
been ravishing ships in the'Carib-

bean for a couple of hundred years, ‘

the audience is treated to several
blatant throat slashings and piano

wire stranglings. (As a warmup ‘to’

this, we get to enjoy an ax .in the
head.) Later on, however, Benchley
goes with guns. they’re quicker and

‘ great for the blood bath at the end.

To add, to the physicalviolence,
the film also ‘presents the viewer

with some psychological violence.
The idea of patricide enters as Nau.
the pirate (David Warner) brain-
washes Maynard’s son into believ-
ing he’s the next pirate king, that
Nau is his real father, and that he
must get rid of Maynard. this is
really one of the sicker dimensions,
as the boy does end up killing some-
one. _,

One would think that with such
an exotic setting as Antigua, West

Indies,‘ any sex scene might be/,,:

enhanced by the surroundings.
Nope. Director Michael Ritchie

preferred to keep it inside a dirty '

tent in the middle of the pirate
camp. The woman who gets the
honor of raping Maynard is
newcomer Angela Punch
McGregor. This movie is the wasted
debut of the Australian who‘ has
won both the best actress and best
supporting actress in Australia in
the same year. In Australia she
played Juliet. In America she gets

to play a filthy grunting pirate

woman. » , .

The two performances worth
mentioning are that of Maynard,
who is played by Michael Caine,
and Nau, played-by David Warner.
‘Caine is good because he is not the

, macho-type hero with whom the au-

dience is secure with from the onset,
but rather a character of fallibility
that today’s audiences seem to be

looking for in their heroes. Warner '

is always good, as his unique per-
formances in Straw Dogs, The
Omen, and Holocaust show. This
versatile actor, who never seems to
get the Mr. Nice Guy part, settles
into the role as naturally as the fish
in the water and the axes in the
heads. The only problem that both

.. men have is that they actually

wanted to make a film like this in
the first lace.

The Isllmd won’t keep you out of
the water like Jaws did." It won’t
even make you worry about going
boating in strange waters with
strange legends. what it will do is
give‘ you some jolts," some nervous
laughs, and leave ‘you disgusted
enough to swear off Benchley for
the rest of your life. And it serves
‘him right.

NATALIE COLE/ ,
MANHATTANS
June 19, 1980
Stanley Theatre "

By DAVID STUBBS

If your tastes call for soul, this
particular’ Thursday nighthad a
good menu for" you. ',The
Manhattans and three-time
Grammy award-winner Natalie
Cole provided the Stanley’s au-
dience with full-ranged vocal
paintings, while their well-
coordinated bands were more
than adequate.

The smooth Manhattans did a
ten-tune set, with the kind of
vocal harmony and
choreography which soul fans
have come to expect. Highlights
from this show were: an acapella
version of “Goodnight
Sweetheart,” “We Never Dance

To A Love Song,” “Feels So
' Good,” their latest hit “Shining
Star,” and “Kiss and Say Good-
bye.” The gem of the perfor-
mance was lead singer Gerald
Thompson’s solo on “The Way
We Were.” Truly an un-
forgetable performance of a
classic tune.

If you saw Natalie Cole in
either of her last two stops in
Pittsburgh. you probably felt
that ‘she owed you one.’ This
time around she gave her fans
the kind of show an artist of her
experience and reputation ,
should. »

* Cole’s Sweet Soul    

, dience’s delight and awe.

The set began with her
talented band performing a brief
medley of several of Cole’s hit
tunes including excerpts from:
“Inseparable,” “Mr. Melody,”
“Lucy In The Sky,” “Sophisti-
cated Lady,” “Can’t Say No,”
“Love On My Mind,” and
“Thankful.”

During her ten-song set, Cole
showed a lot of versatility,
strength and class. After open-
ing with “Sophisticated Lady,”
followed by “Getting Into
You,” and “Love .On ‘My
Mind,” Cole did an intense and
very-well controlled version of
“Hold On,” much to the au-

Cole has been performing the
Beatles’ classic, “Lucy in the
Sky,” for some three or four
years now and it never really
sounded like it was made for her
(remember the sloppy rendition
of her live lp). But now she has
really perfected it. The band
goes through rhythmic changes,
coupled with some very in-
teresting vocal coordination bet-
ween Cole and background
singer Anita that really made
“Lucy” a show stopper-.
“Lucy” also’ shows improved
strength in Cole’s voice. The
evening was topped by Cole’s
first hit, “This Will Be,” the
gentle and artistic “Someone I
Used to Love,” “Our Love,”
and a powerful performance of

“Much Too Fast.”

Jackson Browne does not belong

FESTIVAL OF REGGAE
Stanley Theatre
June 24, 1980

By SAM MATTHEWS AND
‘I scorr MOWRY

They were all there. Jamaicans
and Rastafarians, blacks ‘and

.whites, hippies and punks--creat-

ing one of the most diverse concert
crowds of the year. The purpose of
this wide-range congregation of
people was to- witness the first ap-
pearance of honest-to-God reggae
in Pittsburgh in over two years.
The bill was impressive»
Pittsburgh’s own Rastafari, the

charismatic Toots and the Maytals’

and the instrumentally adept Third

.World. However, sadly, the Stanley

Theatre was barely half-filled. _

It might be a -bit pretentious to
name a band after a movement, do
versions of other people’s songs,
and not have those songs relate to.
your nitch in life, but Rastafari did
justlthat and somehow it worked
appealingly. A home-grown outﬁt,
Rastafari -did tunes such as Bob

' Marley’s “Exodus” and sang of

life in Jamaica. Reggae’as a

.religious and social expression

deals inrelationships to one’s place
in life and Rastafari’s.songs didn’t
relate well to ’ life in Pittsburgh.

~Alright, these guys don’t know

album went into his concert at the
Arena, and he was able to transcend
the problems it poses and produce a
good, fairly intimate show.

Backed by his cracker jack band
(basically the “Running on Empty”
band, but also including Bob Glaub

and Billy Payne), Browne opened,

with a rousing version of “Rock Me
On The Water” and moved easily
th_rough old and new material. He

seemed eager to please and included _

all his older, popular songs.

ae Got Soul: Do

their ideology too well, but their
short 25-minute set was still mighty
impressivel Hope-fully they'll start

displaying themselves at local rock »

venues soon. ~

Atthis point, the audience was, A

thanks to Rastafari, ready to dance
and Toots and the Maytals were
more than happyn to provide the
soundtrack. Frederick" “Toots’_’
Hibbert, a Jamaican analog to Otis
Redding, hadthe crows instantly
on their feet with the opening of
“Pressure Drop” to the closing of
“Reggae Got Soul.” In between,
Toots and his Maytals delighted the
fans with a rastafied version of
John Denver’s “Take Me Home
Country Road,” and other
numbers that indicated that the
Maytals listened heavily to
American soul. Although at times a
little slick, the reggae of Toots and
the Maytals was. energetic and
authentic. -
Where Toots and the Maytals
relied on the hard-driving, bare
bones of soul, Third World leaned

heavily on brilliant musical exper- _
‘tise. Each one of the six-member

Third’ World were exceptionally ac-
complished and versatile musicians,
switching from guitars‘ to bass,
drums and a variety of ‘purcussion
instruments, at will.

The messages of Third World’s

music were more religiously sen-

Highlights included “You Love

and “Fountain of Sorrow”, with an
astonishing solo by pianist Craig

_,Doerge, who was the highlight of

the show behind Browne.

The only wrong turn of the entire
show was A during “Before the
Deluge,” Browne’s anti-nuke song.

' The slides of nuclear power plants

and cute little faces was pretentious
and inapropriate. Otherwise
everything was perfect.
timentalized than the raw dance
bandness of Toots and the Maytals,
but “96 Degrees In the Shade,”
“Cold Sweat,” and others created a
moody, atmospheric concert ex-
perience. Appearing like Caribbean
revivalists, dressed in white from
head to toe, Third World blended
hard-rocking instrumentation with
laid-back, serene rhythms.

‘F By MYRLE KAYE “\

Tom Petty’s excellence in. live
performance has been kept secret
long enough. The loose-armed,
bandy-legged guitarist sauntered in-
to the spotlight at the Stanley
