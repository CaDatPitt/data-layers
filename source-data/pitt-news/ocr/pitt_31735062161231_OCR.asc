*Student Congress picked up the threads of the semester’s
business at last Monday’s meeting, after a lay-off of more than a

month.

An-atmosphere of calm prevailed. Time‘ was spent discussing

I the various committee reports.

Dale Hooper, who has been investigating the possibilities of

‘organizing a council of honorary
fraternities, reported there is much
sentiment favoring such an organi-
zatiorr among the undergraduate
fraternities.

He suggested
assist in the
council.

Green Gets Green Light

The lawmakers approved the re-
port, and President Howard Green-
berger appointed Bill Green as SC
“representative and organizing
force” of the council.

Betty Douglas then announced
the setting-up of a program of SC-

Hal McIntyre and his orchestra

P Due to a clerical error on the part
the William Penn Hotel, which had
previously scheduled another affair
for the same evening, the IF Ball
has been switched from there to the
first floor of the nearby Schen ley.

In consequence, the invitations
per fraternity have been reduced,
since the accomodations will not
be sufficient for the original number

Student Draft Up in Air

Now, General Admits

By JOHN KULAMER

Stop worrying.

That’s what Selective Service'Direct,or Louis B. Hershey tried
to put across to an audience of approximately 2000 Pitt students
who turned out to hear him in Carnegie Music Hall yesterday

_  _,,  {_ morning.
Shrginded’ in Sectiecy.  ‘A

“Mobilization Plans and
Manpower Needs.” He related his

 more right to security than
‘those of the preceding generation,”
he said, and added that, “uncer-
tainty should not make us hysteri-
cal.”

That there are a lot of people
doing a lot of worrying was evi-
denced by the size of the crowd.
The Pittites filled The Music
Hall to capacity, and many had to
be turned away at the doors.

Gen. Hershey urged them to
adopt an optimistic attitude to-
ward the future, and said, "I’m
going to hang on to the? slim shred
of hope that we are not going into
total war.”

Manpower Pool Low
A service force of 3‘/2 million

men is now being planned, he
said. A pool of 7 million is avail-

The younger men of today have ,

able between the present draft age
limits from which the force must be
raised and maintained.

Since most of the men in the
pool are at present ineligible by
reason of previous service, de-
pendency, or physical unfitness,
the question of where to draw from
is a difficult one.

He said he did not know just
how much of the responsibility for
maintaining the armed forces would
be placed on college students, or
on what categories of students.

He was inclined to think that
those in medical, and engineering
schools and in the ROTC had a
better ‘chance of deferments than
those majoring in the social

science s._ _
Wisecracking Speech

“Engineers are easier to sell to
the public than psychologists,” he
said. -

At one point he said that he
favored keeping more men in col-
lege and admitting more women in-
to the services in their stead.

‘”And I have no doubt whatever

about the combative capacity of
women,” he added.

He went on to say that high
scholastic standing may not ne-
cessarily be grounds for defer-
ments, "but it won’t hurt.”

levenlllen Tapped to ODK Fraternity

The University’s highest extra
curricular recognition award went
to 11 students and a faculty mem-
ber when Omicron Delta Kappa,

Cards Now--

Registrar

Pre-registration for the spring
semester ends today when the re-
mainingnon-continuation class cards
are picked up this afternoon.

According to E.A. Batchelder,
assistant registrar, pre-registration
kits may be handed in Monday and
Tuesday of next week since it is
probable that some students will be
absent today. .

Mr. Batchelder hoped that students
would return the kits today to facili-
tate the early distribution of final
registration appointment cards.

Registration In Foster

Final registration will be held
Feb.“ 7, 8, and 9 in Foster Memorial
and in the Cathedral cafeteria and
gymnasium. “All registrants must
enter the Cathedral through the two
Bigelow Boulevard entrances,” Mr.
Batchelder stated,” since the Foster
Memorial doors will not be open.”

The reason for this requirement
was to eliminate the necessity for
students to stand in line outdoors.

Mr. Batqhelder said that all stu-
dents shouldconsult their study lists
for complete instructions pertaining
to registration. Students who re quire
schedule adjustments should con-
sult the departmental heads in their
offices.

Departments at Sea Level

The following departments will
have representatives in the Commons
Room today for courses which are
not continued after the Fall semes-
ter: biologicalsciences, economics,
education, English, history, political
s cience, psychology and sociology.

Here for Commencement

Approximately 800 graduating
seniors will hear Dr. Franklyn B.
Snyder, president emeritus of North-
western University, speak at com-
mencement exercises Feb. 2 in the
Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall.

The exercises begin at 10:30 a.m.

Dr. Snyder’s topic has not yet
been announced.

Students from nine schools, in-
c ludingthe College, Graduate School,
School of Education, School of Bus-
iness Administration,School of Law,
School of Nursing, School of Social
Work, School of Engineering, and
School of Mines, will receive di-

plomas.

The number of seniors graduating
is almost 200 less than the 989 who
received sheepskins last February.

Each senior is entitled to three
tickets to distribute to his family
and friends.

Acting in his official capacity,
Dr. Rufus H. Fitzgerald, chancellor,
will confer the degrees on the grad-
uating seniors.

treating trench mouth and other
associated mouth diseases.

Doctors Stewart and Roth start-

plication to such diseases

kinds of streptococci
and virus-like

Sensing that aureomycin might
be applied to dental work, the two
men obtained a supply of the drug
and went to work on the problem
at their Dental School laborato-
ries. The first patient on whom the
drug was used had necrotic gin-
givitis. Results were favorable.

Results Pleasing

Assisted by Doctor Gerald J.
Cox, director of Pitt dental re-
search, the two doctors have pre-
pared several reports of their work
with aureomycin. A preliminary
paper was published in the Ame-

On Monday, students, faculty and employees arrived in the
Cathedral to find that the usually jammed elevator corridors were

, now overﬂowing. The situation remained that way all day, with
* resulting delays in appointments, classes, and work schedules.

This was a situation affecting everyone who has business in

 the Cathedral, yet notone word was given out in advance, and
when News reporters tried to get an explanation Wednesday, they

were bucked right up to the Chancellor's vacant office.
Just what is going on around here? Is the Chancellor the only
person capable of answering _a few simple questions? Can no one,

formation on matters involving the ‘University family?’
Evidently. not, since this is standard operating procedure on

Frankly, we, as the supposed collectors and disseminators of

our breaths) we're DAMN’ fed up with it.

Whether University underlings (and this means people as high
as Bursar G. S. Rupp) are mistakenly afraid to make statements
without running to the Chancellor or whether the Chancellor him-

V All this lack in our decade of
collegians of what is expected of
youth in exuberance, non-conform-
ity, and high aims, Handlin finds

in sharp contrast to the two pre-
ceding decades. x

In the 1920's, the students, like-
those of today, were a post-war
crop. They were disillusioned,
starkly realistic, but they had an
enormous degree of faith in them-
selves.\They were individualists,
according to Handlin, and their
work was worthwhile to them-
selves because of it. ~

Socialism Pushed in '30's

The collegestudent of thel930-’sv
inherited the previous realism.
While bucking the tight-belted
depression years, these young
men and women embraced the
‘cause of humanitarianism as ex-
emplified in New Deal policies.
Man as a social being was their
concern, and ‘they energetically
set about obtaining a basic secu-
rity through liberalism so that in-
dividual ‘powers would be freed
ffom economic fears_to work for
the benefit of all.

This is the tradition whichwe
of the l940’s were about to inherit,
when war came. Handlin, wonder-
ing why, finds that it never got
inherited. Somewhere, social the-
ories and individualism got lost,
and we have instead, “conformity”
and “inertia.”

Well, are we the spineless

I Pitt Poll - I
By ISABEL LUBOVSKY

“Do you think that the Uni-
versity ought to permit a leading
exponent of communism address
the student body?”

Edward Ascenzi, Col. '52: “In
order for a true democracy to exist
you have to see both sides of the
story.”

Patrick Peters, Grad. School: “I
think that’ not enough people re-
alize what communism is. Maybe
with a realization of it, we can
get rid of it.”

Ernest Tretow, Col. '51: "All
views should be represented.”

Dr. Joseph Macek, lecturer in
Economics: “Yes, I believe in free
discussion on the University plat-
form. I don’t fear’ that a communist

gvould win in free discussion about

socialism.”

Karl Moritz. Engr. '52: "I don’t
think they should permit it because
the student will get the wrong idea

,of communism because a commun-
ist would dramatize his cause.’_’

 

Robert Haddad, Col. '52: “Many
men of intellectual caliber who
subscribe to communist and so-
cialist dogma cannot possibly
be dismissed as men having
nothing at all to present to an
audience._”

Andrew Glagala, Bus. Ed. ’S3:
“Why certainly, I’d like to hear all
about it. The more informed we are
the better we will be prepared to
combat it.”

Dr. Raymond Brittain, assistant

professor of history: “I think they
should be permitted to speak un-
der the proper auspices and if the
right person were selected. It
would be a matter of education to
all of us if we could hear someone
discuss communism fairly.”
‘ Alfred Bartolacci, Col. ’52: "I
don’t think we ought to have them.
come here and make speeches.
After all that’s what we’re fight-
ing against.”

Carl Freismith, Pre Med. ’5l:
“I think they should be permitted
to speak. After all no one will be
forced to go, only those interest-
ed.”

George Murphy, lecturer in
sociology: “If the University is to
encourage students to think they
must permit them to see both sides
of every issue." '

Arden Dunkle, Nurs. Ed. ’52: “I
think they should, because we
have to know both sides of the
story before we can understand the
whole situation.”

Melvin Silver, Col. ‘S1: “Yes,
because I feel that college stu-
dents ‘should have the ability to
hear and discriminate both sides
of any question.”

Monty Monoriti, Engr. ’51: "Def-
initely not. The less any student
in the University has to do with
anything or anyone associated
with communism the better off will
be the University standards.”

Marcia Sachs, Ed. ‘S1: “It will
permit us to see "both sides of the
issue.”

 

 

 

No Guts?

By JACK MARKOWITZI 

xi

Has the University lost its guts? One is inclined to think so. - ’

~l

In days like these, with the world moving inevitably toward a’
full-scale war, it is reasonable that a student should,be able to‘,
expect his school to go out of itstway to aid his thinking on im- \ V

m ediate world problems .

And, in the modern university,
this aid should not and cannot be
confined to the classroom, but
should come in large measure from
visiting lecturers, experts on the
world situations.

But, keeping that in mind, con-
sider the kind and number of guest
speakers we have had here since
September. -

There was Mrs, Induk Pahk, who
outdid a whole corps of cheer-'
leaders with a Korean pep rally.

There was Sir Osbert Sitwell,

Few and of little V

And rhat’s all. Not very impres-
sive, is it?

Look again over that list, and
you will find. one transcendent
characteristic of all the speakers--
they are all so ‘safe.’

You could not squeeze from any
of them a single original or (I
hesitate to use the-word) contro-
versial statement. I

Both Dean and Hershey are of-
ficials of the govememnt. Mrs..
Pahk is an employee of the State
Department’s ‘Voice of America.’

No severe critic have we had.
This is not to say that any of the
three lecturers were not, or, in the
case of the Dean, would not have
been, worthwhile.

But you get only half an edu-
cation from public relations men.
Spokesmen for present national
policy are, of course, in order,
but the true value of lectures lies
in making students think, in mak-
ing them worry, “Are we really
right?,” rather than in sending
them away with the firm convic-
tion that we are and always have
been on the side of goodness and
light.

When powerful debate is needed
--now--the lack of backbone in -a
lecture series is perhaps most evi-

, policy if ever there was one.

easily the most detached man ‘,
you'll ever meet, who discussed
‘The Civilization of Angkor Vat.’

And yesterday there was Gene-I
ral Lewis B. Hershey, head of the
Selective Service, the first man
who has had anything important
to say all year.

Around Thanksgiving we were
to have had Gordon Dean, chair-
man of the Atomic Energy Com,-
mission, but his talk was snowed’ 
out.

alue

dent. But the- University has‘
flubbed in the past. ii-

For instance, during the last ‘
presidential campaign, when Henry —‘
Wallace was a very hot potato, E i
that hapless candidate was denied I
the speaker’s platform here.

While the University was not
madly in love with Wallace's ideas,
the excuse given was thathis
speech would be a political one,
and politics is taboo. _

But for that excuse itself, there 
is no excuse. For a University to‘ ,
refuse the platform to a man who . ..
may be the next president, or -,
governor, or sheriff is a muddled I’

n.

Perhaps the students would
like to hear the ideas of the men ~ V
in whom the national fate is’to be  L
trusted. ‘ ‘

Where is the sense in rejecting ‘
‘politics’ as tainted, when politics 
is the molder of nationalpolicy? I A

The simple fact is, ironically,‘
that the University will exert‘ter- '
rific energy to keep from offending L
the powers that be -- ‘whether they »
be trustees or contributors to the
building fund or state legislators
or the men in the street, I can’t
say.

Extremes Give Meaning to Ideals, E!

To use the most extreme case,
what would be the objection to in-
viting say, the Editor of The Daily
Wbrker to lecture here?

It is an appalling idea, I know,
but keeping in mind that the Uni-
versity is dedicated to a free ex-
change of ideas; isn’t he as elig-
ible to speak as any other man?

His ideas and opinions, no mat-
ter whether honestly held or just
the echo of the ‘party line,’ are
certainly important. Half the world
believes in them. They are the
ideas against which ours contend
in the world bar of public opinion.

It follows that they are worth
hearing, especially since we are the
future leaders of society, or so I’m
told, and should be able to choose
between valid and invalid ideas, and
in fact to justify our own ideasiin
the arena of free debate.

An extreme case it is, I know,
but if educational ideals are more
than just platitudes for the suckers,

if we are confident that the modern

student can choose between the

good and the bad if the pros and
cons of both are presented to him,
then there is no speaker in the
world who should be exempt from
appearing at the Foster Hall I ’
lectern. - ‘_ ‘

In fact, I submit that the stu-  A
dent who embraces Communism,
does so just because ..,,of the ar-.' .
bitrary barrier placed between him- 
self and the ideas of that faith.

If the things we live by are real I
champs, they don’t have to beghjseint - 3
into the ring with brass knuckles.‘-A  ‘i

In times of stress, the dangers 
faced on the battlefield are no
more important than those faced by
the national welfare at home, when,‘ “
in the heat of the moment, we are ,
prone to shut off the flow of hon- if
e st, and even dishonest criticism.

The national welfare” is not.
served by setting a course and re- i- ‘7
garding it henceforth as sacro-

formist line.

‘Closely Associated’

By MYRON KOPELMAN‘. -

. _L-. L '. . -

...;;,r . _ .« .-  - -.   , -,1  ,_

Attorney General Charles J. Margiotti, whose free work probe
has constantly been under fire as being politically inspired, has‘
now further weakened any public confidence which he might have
possessed. I am referring to his flimsy charges of “Red associa-
tions” against Asst. District Attorney Marjorie Matson, and his
involvement of Dr. Marion fHathway, Pitt professor.

In his demands that District Ac-
tomey Rauhauser fire Mrs. Matson,
Margiotti presents no evidence that
she is a Communist or a member of
the Commie-front organizations. He
merely implies -- and implication
is becoming an increasingly popu-
lar method of discrediting persons
-- that Mrs. Matson is not a desir-
able member of society.

Listing his charges, Margiotti
declares that Mrs. Matson

is
“closely associated” with Dr.
Marion llathway, professor of
public welfare here. So what?
Hounded by Gunther

Dr. Hathway has no police re- v
‘ord. True, she has been hounded ‘

t 

from time to time by the politically
ambitious Judge Blair F. Gunther,
who accused her of being connect-
ed with Red-front groups. But judg-
ing from the support which Dr.
llathway received from her fellow
instructors, there are a good many
respectable people who do not
mind being “closely associated”
with her. ,

Typical of the tactics used by
the Gunthers and Margiottis was
the _judge’s statement that Dr.
Hathway “is teaching the young
folks here that there is something
wrong’ with this country.” It was
an appeal to morons, and morons

V‘ are voters, you know.

Obviously there is a good deal
wrong with the country as long as
irresponsible men continue -to hold A‘ 7
high public offices, such as judge , ‘
of state superior court or attorney
general of the Commonwealth.

Stassen Reprimandedi

I see where Hal Stassen, the
globe-trotting college president,
is finally catching it from the‘-
State Legislature, which appro-
priates funds to Hal's University

of Pennsylvania. I

Representative Hiram G. An-
drews, Johnstown, makes the same
point stressed in this column se- ,
veral months ago. His advice to
Penn’s trustees is that if they
“are unable to endow Mr. Stassen ,
with a sense of propriety, they 
should for his good and their-‘
good dismiss him so that he will
be able to travel the earth on his
own time.”

Well‘ said ,_ Mr. An_drew’s.

Tankers Host Strong Rutgers Bearcats Lead Nation 
r=wo~»«vm>oc-< In Point-Getting   

Areal treat is in store for Pitt swimming fans tomorrow night. For at
BY WILL DOERGE

8:15 the Pitt tankers will host the perennially strong Rutgers University

natators at the YMHA pool.

"It will be the best dual swim-

ming meet that we have had around
here since the 1942 Michigan State
meet which ended in a 42-42 tie,”
remarks Pitt’s swimming coach
Ben Grady.

Last year Rutgers handed Pitt
its only setback in dual competi-
tion, 40-35. The Scar1ets"l949-50
record showed nine wins and three
defeats. Coach James Reilly’s
team opened its campaign this year
with an easy 50-25 win over Colum-
bia.

Pitt likewise started off the sea-
son in fine style whipping Franklin
8; Marshall, 52-23, but Grady re-
alizes that F&M was no power-
house in swimming circles like
Rutgers.

Five veterans and seven sopho-
mores will bear Pitt’s hopes tomor-
row night. Jim Zentgraf, Eastern
Collegiate Swimming 440 yard
Champion and Al Ciocca, holder of
the diving title in 1949.

"Rutgers’ reserve power may be
too much for us to handle, but win,
lose, or draw, there will be pool re-
cords shattered with the calibre of
swimmers participating,” says
Grady, whose teams have lost only
two dual meets in the past two
years.

Pi Lams Nip
Theta Chi

Flashing more bounce than an

India rubber ball, Pi Lambda Phi
squeezed out a 32-39 comeback
victory over Theta Chi at the
Trees gym on Wednesday night.
_ The Pi Lams, operating slug-
gishly in the first half, trailed a
fine ball-handling Theta Chi team,
17-10, at intermission.

The _hectic second half showed
an entirely rejuvenated Pi Lam
five. The Lams, aided by fresh,
late-arriving reserves, rebounded
with 22 points, finally forging
ahead with less than a minute left

to play.
In another Wednesday night
match, Delta Sigma Phi upset

Cincinnati has a 7-1 record, los-
ing only a one-pointer to DePau-l
last week. Duquesne was the most
recent victim of the speedy Bear-
Cats, bowing 86-74 here this week.

Larry Imburgia, (6-0) the Cincy
sophomore sensation, leads his team
with a 24.1 point average a game
on the phenomen_al field goal per-
cenatge of .622. However, he may
be sidelined for the Pitt game.

But the Bearcats still have the

You’ll remember Luchi for his sen-

at the University of Washington.
That’s because the Union Building
is a friendly place, always full of

By MYRON KOPELMAN
Sports Editor

Frank Carver, Pitt’s gra-
duate manager of athletics, sel-
dom watches a. Pitt basketball
game anymore. “I can’t watch a
man the likes of Doc (Coach
H.,C. Carlson) take the stuff he
does in these games. ’

Well, the Doctor’s team lost to
Tech by more than 20 points Wed-
nesday, and the howling reached
fortissimos. All of which
makes it more ironic that a man
of immense capabilities should.
‘be mixed up in sports - _a busi-
ness which produces more lunacy
and less usefulness than any
other enterprise except war.

Strange to say, there are a, good
many brilliant men involved in
sports because it has a clever way
of snatching a man’s affections
while he is too young to know
better. Once he gets in deep, he
finds it hard to divorce himself.

If, somehow, we could recon-

vert all the sports figures of bril-
liance to the status of human
beings - if we could make them
useful members of society - this
old universe would undoubtedly
be the better for it.

No Respectability

On the face of it, "Dr. H.C.
Carlson” is a very respectable,
businesslike name which might
belong to an archaeologist or a
philosopher or even a physician

(which its owner happens to be).
But no, Dr. Carlson is in sports,
so his name can possess none of
the respectability which goes with
these jobs.

To the sports writers his.name
is the makings of H.C. (Hot and
Cold) Carlson, H.C. (How Come?)
Carlson, H.C. (Hopeless Cause)
Carlson, or just plain “Doc.”

Now maybe it is to the credit
of sports that it moves on in a
light, informal fashion. Being at-
tached to sports as he is, how-

_.. ever, Doc Carlson will never be

anything more than a source of
Hot Copy, as in II. C., and a
thinker in a business in which
thinking is taboo.
Carlson should have
Congressman. '
Physically, he possesses that
overstuffed look which at one
glance assures you that he can
measure up to the qualifications of
a senatorial windbag. As New York
Herald-Tribune columnist Red
,.Smith put it, he is a “chubby,
cherubic gentleman whose fringe
of white hair sits like a halo atop
a complexion that is old rose in
repose and becomes a violent ma-
genta within sight of a basketball
court.” . '

Outdoes Sen. McCarthy

Thus with plenty of character
color and a neon vote‘-getting smile
for the ladies, he looks as- though

been a

he belongs n_o other place in the -

world than on a soapbox. Toss in
his crisp diction plus his alternat-
ing wit, satire, and sugary charm,
and you have a Senate floor or
probe room orator who would pack
them in’ so tightly they would have
to relegate Senator McCarthy to
the men’s room.

In debate Carlson would dis-
pose of his adversaries as neatly
as he has been disposing of bas-
ketball officials through the
years.

During the course of a game
last year, an official was crouch-
ing in front of him, with the seat
of his pants staring the Doctor

right in the eye. Carlson could not
see the play so he reached out and
gave the official a gentle push. It
being a flagrant foul to touch an
official, the man with the whistle
wheeled around and shouted, “I

  

warn you, Carlson, I’ll call a
technical foul.”
\"hereupon the coach tartly re-
plied, “Then will you kindly
quit sticking your brains in my
face, sir?”

In election years adequate news-
paper coverage of Dr. Carlson’s
campaign stunts would have to run
over into the sports pages where
sports editors would be forced to
wrap up Dimaggio’s contract par-
leys into a handful of para-
graphs. A spontaneous stunt
would take place at every whistle-
stop -- at least if Carlson ran true

‘ to his reputation.

Conga Line

Once, when he became disgust-
ed with the ladylike mannerisms of
a referee, he sent his players out
for the second half in a conga line
with their jackets tied skirt-like
around their hips. As they one-
two-three-kicked their
said official, their
happened to be leading the line,
was ordered off the floor for the
night.

A futile banishment it was,
though, for he Dmmptly put on a
babushkas and joined a sorority
in the sixth row, from which
point he and his new-found sis-
ters nearly drove the official
out of his mind.

With his resources applied to the
political field, Dr. Carlson’s en-
thusiasm and readiness to do the

way past

unpredictable could turn Republi-
cans or Democrats against Democ-
rats. _

Down at West Virginia Univer-
sity where a capacity crowd of
7000 was booing his players in-
cessantly, Carlson suddenly leap-
ed to his feet and led the booing
with ‘twice the vitality of any man
in the crowd. Completely startled,
the booers ended up cheering the
Doctor and his young men.

Enthusiasm Contagious

As for his enthusiasm, it is no-
thing short of contagious. At peak
spirits he once called upon one of
his players, Paul Zehfuss, to get
into the ball game and give his
all,

Zehfuss bounded from the
bench, cast off his leggings, and
dashed onto the basketball floor.
At first the crowd gasped. Then
it roared. Zehfuss had really
given his all.

With his spirit- and wit carrying

him into senatorial office by a
landslide, Carlson would waste
no time justifying his consti-

tuent’s faith in him. For several
decades‘ he has sat on basketball
rules’ committees, and anyone who
can understand the tangled rules
of basketball would have no
trouble fathoming federal law.
Most Diplomatic

Make note, moreover, of .his
diplomatic manner which would
probably reduce explosive si-
tuations to a peep. He would more
than likely confront‘a filibusterer
at the opening of session with a
request that he “please sit down
and be a good boy today.”

I can remember himbeaming

down on a Penn State coach
who had assailed him in the

)

Drill Night

K

papers all week and extending
that very same request. The
State coach looked more puz-
zled than annoyed. Darned if.
he didn't sit on the bench like a
good little boy all night. ’

No, there is not a Congres-
sional situation all the way up to,
and including the cry, “Is there‘
a doctor in the house?” which.
Carlson could not meet. Here is a
man whose brain bulges from a5
furor of activity raging inside,l
and he is spending his timeon‘
a game in which a bunch of skinny
lads in their underwear try to
loop an inflated piece of leather
through a stringed basket. ;

There is no justifying this ar-l
rangement. If the institution ofl
sports is serious about wanting
to contribute to our way of life,
it should kick out all the Doc
Carlson and tell them to go make
full use of their capabilities.

But, of course, Doc Carlson will
never even run for alderman. He.
is too deeply involved with Dame
Sport, and she is a leechy com-
panion who knows how to holdl
her man. E
