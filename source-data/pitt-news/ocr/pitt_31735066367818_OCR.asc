Dr. Shepherd L. Witman, dig-P

rector of the University’s Office of

Monday and began three weeks of

participation in educational con-'

Witman’s first stop is in Paris,
Where he will be the moderator
for a six-day World Conference on
International Houses and Centers.

Attended by some 90 representa- ,
tives from 20 different countries,

the Conference will hear Dr. Wit-
man report on the University’s ed-
ucational exchange program and
Pittsburgh’s progress toward be-

C0ming . an international commu-
'\

nity. -

Pollowing the meetings in Paris,
Witman will journey to Zurich,
Saarbrucken, and Cologne, There
he will confer with officials of uni-
versities located in those cities on

criticism that Union programs

Editor, The Pitt News:
In my four years as a part-

time evening student at the Uni-

versity it has been my experi-
ence that the University Admin-
istration cares little and does
less in providing the scholastic
needs of the part—time student.

The University’s system of
student counseling and registra-
tion has long been cause for

       

 

y’ 3

laughter, except for those un-
fortunates who are forced to en-
dure its ineptness. Now, how-
ever, the Administration has
reached a new high.

If I may, I would like to use
a personal example to illustrate
my point. After accumulating 88
credits toward .a Bachelor of’
Science degree in I’sy'chology, I
have been informed‘ that_..the re-
maining required courses in my
major ﬁeld will no longer be
offered in the evening school
and my only recourse _is to
transfer to the n‘ewly—founded
School of General Studies as a
social science major.
In these competitive times
the

Bachelor’s degree becomes in-

when signiﬁcance of a

creasingly less with each suc-

ceeding class, of what value can
such a general degree be?

If the institute of higher
learning exists for the student,
as it says ‘in large print, why
aren’t the students given a voice
in their destiny as well as a few
pseudo-intellectuals who have
been sheltered behind their
“Hallsof Ivy” for such a long
time that they are no longer in
touch with the outside world?

I realize that I am only one
case in thousands but I feel
certain that my situation is be-
ing multiplied many times over.
The question I would raise is:

Does the Un,i,,\/ersit.y have the
legal right to ignore its prior
committment to the evening stu-
dent and can the Administration
justify its action?

Examining the Press. . .

 

 

College Communications

By Harriet Weliner ~

Put three communist, three western and six
neutral correspondents together in one room, ask
them if their nation is a democratic one, then
wait for the great clash of ideas.

I found myself thinking along this line when I
recently attended a press con-
ference held by the Office of
Cultural and Educational Ex-
change for visiting foreign cor-
respondents. I had never met a
communist. I could only antici-
pate the type of journalist that
a communist nation would "per-
mit to wander around the United
States.

I waited, but the clash never
came.

An open—shirted man from
West Germany with a perpetual ﬁve o'clock shadow
smiled at a pale-faced Polish fellow while dis-
cussing the Oder-Neisse border problem between
their countries; a long-winded, yet entertaining,
representative from the’ United Arab Republic
laughed, louder and more enthusiastically, than
anyone else when the British representative, en-
dowed with a wit characteristic of that island,
crisply exclaimed, in reference to Kuwait, that
the British should not go about sticking their noses
into other people’s business. Then she added that
petrol was too damn expensive anyway.
Personalities Emerge --

Amid the light humor that prevailed through-
out the discussions, the personalities behind the
vague titles of communists, westerners and neu-
tralists emerged. Each tried to communicate their
views to the others. 2

Possibly the only thing I saw accomplished at
this meeting was some insight into humanity —
the natural bonds between men and their similar
desires. But even a renewal of this ancient insight
was refreshing to me.

This experience,’which I prefer to consider not
a by-product of my hopeful imagination, illus-
trates a great art .— "communication. At this press
conference, it dissolved those intangible man-made
barriers between individuals of different nations,
even if only temporarily.

The imperative need to improve the communi-
cations seems to be the most difﬁcult task facing
our nation. Striving for some perfection in this
field, however, cannot be limited to the diplomatic

This ls What We Are...

 

corps of our National government. The advance.
ment needed there depends on the amount of sup-
port that society’s organizations give.

I I left the press conference, wondering why the
University has not stressed the value of communj-
cation in its undergraduate school.

I must admit, however, that this press confer.
ence merely assembled some of my thoughts from
the past few months, focusing more poignantly on
the area of communication.

My concern arose originally when Pitt’s jour-
nalism department was dissolved. As editor this
year, I had an editorial staff more than 80 per
cent of whom were journalism majors. _I’ve been
informed that this is a rarity in Pitt News staffs,
Dissolved Departments

This doesn’t seem to be as rare, however, as
dissolving departments. The fact that there is no
journalism department has cast a rather demoral-
izing effect on members of the’ Pitt News staff,
mainly because they’d hoped that this department
would be expanded.

It is true that technical skills such as photog-
raphy, editing, layout and design can -be picked
up quickly outside of class, but at the same time
they can be learned with more understanding‘ in
class. Such courses as political writing, analysis
of propaganda techniques, radios and television
broadcasting, aid in interviewing, and news con-
cepts surely cannot be adopted by the Englsh de-
partment.

Expand Journalism

An expanded journalism department is a ne-
cessity if students are to obtain the educational
background necessary for working in the realm of
communications. A curriculum which would in-
clude a journalism department could not possibly
deviate from the long’ range plan of a liberal arts
education with greater depth in one ﬁeld while

still maintaining sufficient background in related

areas.

If this is done, the University would be show-
ing that it understands the need for improvement
in this ﬁeld as much as political scientists and for-
eign correspondents do. Maybe the statement that
the representative of the United Arab Republic
made -- “the people in this world can exist side by
side in peace as long as they can discuss the issues
of greatest importance to them, like we are doing
now” — will be reconﬁrmed by University educa-
tors capable of realizing that journalism as a com-
municative art cannot be condensed into two or
three courses in the English department.

It is easy for someone writing a “last” column to take "
advantage of the opportunity to blast the administration or,
in .my case, the'Athletic Department. I choose rather to
glance at the entire Pitt athletic program as I have seen it
develop under the present trimester system.

There is no question aboutlthe trimester system effect-
ing Pitt sports. Under present rules any student wishing to

 

to attend the third trimester.

 

In baseball and track there are only a few games that are

played
Thus any athlete playing spring
sports “pays” for those few

games with 12 credits of work.
This is a bitter pill for the re-
cruiter to sell to the better athlete.
But there are two possible al-
ternatives. The NCAA could
waive the rule requiring “spring
athletes” to attend the third
term, or Pitt could give more
scholarships in spring sports.

Few sports fans will dispute the
fact that Peery rates as the Casey

The University has raised it’s
entrance requirements. This.

this stand will pay off in rich ,

University Seminar Proves Advisors Human

Counselors Meet at University

Group Studies
‘Helping lAble
Youth Learn’

By JUDY MEISLIK

Guidance counselors are
human. Forty-ﬁve of the
species are proving this at
the Third Annual Guidance
and ' Counseling Institute
sponsored by the National De-
fense Education Act.

Their purpose is “to contribute
to the competence of secondary
school counselors and guidance
workers in identifying able
youths, assessing their special ta-
lents, aiding them to define oc-
cupational objectives commensu-
rate with their talents, and per-
suading them to seek high-level
attainment through wisely plan-
ned educational experiences.”

Representing a general sample
of the local junior and senior
high school populations the one
hundred students participating
have undergone a week of intense
testing and counseling.

This program headed by Adolph
Bluemenfcld of Taylor Allderdice
High School and Howard Mc-
Cracken of Chartiers Valley High
School has attracted participants
from a four state area. In order
to enroll each must have had
three or more years of experience
in secondary teaching or coun-
seling.

In the midst of all this serious
work these students, like all of
the others at the University,

have found time to behave like .

idiots.

In fact one member of the in-
stitute stated that “the one test
necessary for admittance to the

session is a sanity test which must
be failed.”

As far as failures go, these men
and women have proven them-
selves a success in counseling.
Judy Duffala, sophomore atBeth-
e1 Park High School stated that
“the whole thing was pretty in-
teresting. Even more interesting
was seeing the teachers behave
like high school students."

The reason that she feels this
way is the habit that the coun-
selors have of writing notes like
“the leader is a madman,” “I
wish that I had a Tom Collins,”
and “except for the sex dangle
there’s nothing a high school kid
can’t do.” “Wanna bet?”

But the Leader, who is not a
madman, contends that the pur-
pose of all this is “to create _a
relaxed atmosphere which can

Robert A. Bernhoft, counselor
from Marcellus Central School in
Syracuse, New York, believes that
“this is a highly stimulated group
which has received a great deal

the constant exchange of ideas
and the excellent teaching by a

‘Cafe’ Ends

Dorm Council

Summer Plans

Inter-dorm Council concluded
activities for the year last week
by sponsoring the Cafe Quad-
rangle, a free dance in an in-
formal French atmosphere. This
was the third and ﬁnal of ‘the
Council‘s programs for the spring
trimester.

Previously, the Council had
sponsored the Faculty-Admini-
stration versus Students softball
game and the picnic at Cripple
Creek State Park. According to
the Council, the Cafe was an at-
tempt to establish strong relations
between men’s and women’s dorm
systems.

The Inter-dorm Council, con-
sisting of Joel Patrick, Fred
Kunken, Dennis Kritsky, Sue
Goldmeier, and Judy Rockwell,
was set up to provide informal,
non-date affairs for on-campus
students.

According to the Council, no
plans have been viewed for the
fall trimester, “because we aren’t
sure we’ll be in charge in the
Fall, and then it’s up to our suc-

Expansion  

A medical research unit for pa-
tlents who have diseases requir-
ing special study will be esta-
blished within the next year in
the expanded Presbyterian-Uni-
versity Hospital. The new four-
teen—bed unit is being made pos-
sible by an establishing grant of
$450,000 to the University by the
Division of General Medical Sci-
ences of the National Institutes of
Health.

Dr. Jack D. Meyers, professor
and chairman of the department
of the University
medical school, will serve as in-
terim director of the program un-
til a fulltime director is appoint-
ed.

The funds from the grant will
be used to remodel an area in
Presbyterian-University Hospital,
to purchase new equipment, and
to ' cover operating expenses.
Plans call for laboratories, social
service facilities, a diet kitchen,
and a recreation room.

In addition to the normal
number of hospital employees
assigned to a unit of this size,
the new facility will have a spe-
cial staff consisting of a direc-
tor, two medical technicians, one
social worker, two research die-
titians, two research nurses, and
a secretary. ,

Presbyterian-Uni_versity Hospit-
al will be reimbursed for operat-
ing expenses through the grant
on a per diem basis. Eventually,
the hospital will receive about
$250,000 annually from the Na-
tional Institutes of Health to sup-
port the program. Patients, who
will be selected by a faculty com-
mittee from the medical school
and the Graduate School. of Pub-
lic Health, will not pay for this
specialized care.
