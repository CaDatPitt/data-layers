‘ B Druids
sit on
Allocations
a Committee

lMatt Singer
Staff Wrz'ler

When students discuss the
responsibilities of the Student
Government Board, its role in the
allocation of the Student Activities
Fund is always at the top of the list.

The Board, responsible for allo-
cating the $2.3 million that makes
up the Student Activities Fund, has

V faced signiﬁcant scrutiny over the

past week because of its reported
association with the Druids, a se-
cret society on campus. But in ad-
dition to the six_members of the
Board who are part of the exclusive‘

group,_the Druids have also been ,

well-represented in another sig-
niﬁcant body on campus —— SGB’s
Allocations Committee.

Arguably the most consistently
active of the eight committees that
report to the Board, the Alloca-
tions Committee is responsible for
evaluating requests for allocations
of the Student Activities Fund from
student organizations looking to
use the money for group activities.
The 13—person committee docu-
ments and discusses requests at
a private meetingeach week and
then presents its ﬁmding recom-
mendations to the Board, along
with the allocations requests at
SGB’s _weekly public meeting.

According to current Allocation
Committee Chair Alex Majchrzak,
the committee has no conﬂict of
interest policy, and members are

Climate change expertjoseph Romm
delivered an apology to the Pitt com-
munity. yesterday afternoon.
“From your generation to mine,
it’s not pretty what is going to hap-

pen in the coming decades,” he said. ~

Pitt’s Honors College holds lec-
tures each year to educate the Pitt
community about global warming
and climate change. This year, the
Honors College hosted Romm, an
expert, authorand blogger in the
ﬁeld. He delivered the lecture to
about 300 people at 3 p.m. yester-
day in the].W. Connolly Ballroom in
Alumni Hall.

Articles in national publications

such as the New York Times and Na-
tional Geographic have cited Romm,
and Rolling Stone mentioned him
among the “1o0 People Who Are
Changing America” in 2.009.
Romm, a principal deputy assis-

. tant secretary in the U.S. Depart-

ment of Energy’s Office of Energy
Efﬁciency and Renewable Energy
from 1995 to 1998 and assistant
secretary in the same oﬁice dur-
ing 1997, came to better prepare

the Pitt community in regard to.

the challenge of global warming.
He said that since many audience
members have already heard the
basics of global warming, he would
speak about “what you can’t easily
ﬁnd on the Internet.” A

. f‘The current generation of peo-

_ple running this country have set

up a system that is not sustainable
so that your generation will not be
able to consume as we consumed,”
he said. .

Edward Stricker, dean of the
Honors College, said that educat-
ing the community about climate
change is important because global
warming is not a subject of universal
attention such as other challenges
in the past. if

He explained that every genera-
tion has faced a distinct challenge.
For his generation, the Cuban Mis-
sile Crisis was a time of uncertainty
about the future. Before that, Ameri-
cans dealt with the Great Depression
and the Cold War.

Stricker said that although we

can now look back on those events
with insight and understanding, it
was not clear during the time what
was actually happening, what was
going to happen and what individu-
als were supposed to do.

Romm said that the DOE used
the term “sustainable development”
to describe a method of economic
growth that would take ﬁiture gen-
erations into consideration during
his tenure there. A _ '

“I remember going to UC Berke-
ley and telling students that sustain-
able development is like teenage
sex. Those who say they’re doing
it aren’t, and those who are doing
it aren’t doing it very well,” he said.

 Administrators“ have final authority over SGB decisions. 

Natalie Daher
Stqff Writer

When the Student Government Board gathers
in Nordy’s ‘Place to delegate or not delegate
money to student organizations during Public
Meeting every Tuesday night, its decisions
seem ﬁnal. In reality, the ﬁnal call actually
lies inthe hands of certain administrators.
While’ University officials attest that the

Board is properly informed to makecapable

_allocations decisions, any blatant violation of
written guidelines would necessitate admin-
istrative intervention.

Not many students know that three admin-
istrators reserve the right to make the ﬁnal
decisionregarding any allocated money. Those
administrators include Kathy Humphrey, the
dean of students; Kenyon Bonner, the associate
dean of students and adviser to the Board, and
Terry Milani, the associate director of student
life and Allocations Committee adviser.

“The budget that is allocated to our Student
Qovemment Board is under the jurisdiction

I of the Division of Student Affairs,” Humphrey

said in an email. “Therefore, I am ultimately
responsible for how_the ﬁinds are used.”
There are also documented guidelines
that illuminate administrative supervision
of spending in the SGB Constitution. Accord-
ing to Article II, Section IV of the allocations
process, “As necessary, the budgets of any or
all student organizations shall be reviewed
by the President of the Board, the Allocations
Chair, the Student Government Board Adviser
and the Allocations Committee Adviser.”
, Additionally, the section titled “Arbitration
of Disputes Regarding SGB Funding Decisions”

allows student organizations to appeal a fund-
ing decision to Milani, Bonner or Humphrey
if they deem it to be outside of the Allocations
Code. '

“We have checks and balances in place to
ensure that resources are being used appro-
priately within established parameters,” Hum-
phrey said. “If SGB or a student organization
steps outside ‘of those guidelines, there are
procedures in'place to rectify the situation.”

‘Bonner said he carmot recall any organi- '

zation issuing the “formal appeal” of an SGB
decision during his past three years as adviser
to the group. When it comes to allocations
decisions, Bonner said that it is his respon-
sibility to override any decision that violates
the guidelines. But this issue has never arisen
during his time at Pitt, and to his knowledge,
beforehand.

, While he does offer advice to the Board’ on
programs and ﬁinding, Bonner emphasized
that it is just that — advice. He does not expect
the Board to utilize all of his advice, although
he said that the members typically do.

“Our role as administrators is to advise .

them and help them and, if necessary, step
in to address any issues of malfeasance,” he
said. “In my time, I’ve never seen [an] instance
of malfeasance on behalf of the SGB. They’re
well-rounded and well-grounded in what their
purpose is on campus.” '

Board member Michael Nites said that
he frequently met with Milani for advice on
allocations decisions while he acted as allo-
cations chairman in 2012, and on occasion

-they would “fundamentally disagree.” While

he valued Milani’s input, Nites said that the
administrators do not generally get involved
unless they are asked, and the Board does not

always take their suggestions.
For instance, in November of last year, the

Allocations Committee and the Board clashed '

on afunding decision regarding Plant to Plate
— a student—run urban farming organization
that grows produce to donate to area‘ food
banks and clubs. The group requested $1,800
for seeds, and debate stirred over whether

funding the seeds violated the disposability

precept of the Allocations Manual. ,

Nites recalled that Milani recommended
to fund the request because the seeds were
“necessary for the group to function.” But the
majority of Allocations’ Committee members
— who Nites said were aware of Milani’s advice
—— rejected the request. The Board approved
the request nonetheless. ' _ -

Allocations Chairman Alex Maj chrzak in-
dicated that Bonner stays rather “hands-off”
at meetings and decisions, believing that SGB
allocations decisions are “very ﬁnal.” A

“At the end of the day, [Milani] under-
stands, and he believes that the students

should be the ones making those decisions,” .

Maj chrzak said.

Every year, each non—College of General
Studies undergraduate pays an $80 activities
fee. This money becomes the Student Activi-

ties Fund, which ‘amounted to over $2.3—mil-l
' lion for the 2012-2013 school year. SGB then

allocates the money to student organizations.
Certain organizations called “formula
groups” receive a guaranteed percentage of
the fund each year. According to the SGB Con-
stitution Resolution 0001 passed in February
2009, the formula groups include Panther
Prints (1.6 percent), Pitt Program Council (33.5

percent), Student Volunteer Outreach (3.9 . '

percent), Telefact (3.4 percent) and WPTS--FM

Radio (6.1 percent). L '

The constitution states that these groups
receive the allotted percentage because they
“are recognized by the Ofﬁce of Student Life
as serving an integral role in enhancing the
student experience at the University of Pitts-
burgh.” Before the formula existed, the groups’
funding was excessively inconsistent.

A revision to Resolution,’O001,.passed in
December of last year, removed Telefact from
the list beginning in the _f_'allof 2014'. '

After SGB gives money to the formula '
' groups, the Board reserves the remaining
ﬁinds to allocate to student organizations on ‘

a request basis throughout the year.

Groups planning to request funding must I

ﬁll out the necessary paperwork and then at-
tend,SGB’s weekly public meeting Tuesday
nights in Nordy’s Place of the William Pitt
Union. At the meeting, the group pitches its
request, the Allocations Committee members
7 offer their recommendation, and the Board de-
cides whether to approve or reject the request;
In order to make ‘recommendations and
decisions, the Board refersto documented

policies‘ in the Allocations Manual. For .in- '

stance, rules forbid SGB from funding events
that compete or duplicate PPC programs, do.-
nations, alcohol or tobacco products, salaries
for coaches, ﬁrst class airfare, personal gifts
and travel expenses for advisers or nonstudent
members. The rules also forbid reimbursing

clubs for expenses they have alreadypaid for ,

before submitting their requests.

SGB President Gordon Louderback said
these regulations are not necessarily set in
stone and that the Board operateson a case-

Nowthe people who are behaving like «

teenagers are the parents of current students,
Romm said.

“They’re living like there’s no tomorrow,”
he said.“You’re in college and thinking long-
term, but your parents aren’ .”

According to Romm, many people ignore .

the subject or think about it so much that they
begin to believe that the ﬁiture, is hopeless.
Though he did notpredict that world leaders
will tackle the issue in this decade, he said
that he is certain that within 20 years they
/will invest a great deal of effort to confront
this climate change. .

Once the world becomes serious and

- decides; to deal with the issue, it will spend

between $1 trillion and $2 trillion a year on
climate change, Romm proposed, suggesting
clean energies as a result.

“The great activity of the entire world and
universities will be ﬁguring out how to stop
things from getting much worse and dealing
with how bad it already is,” he said.

The irreversibility of climate change,
Romm said, sets it apart from other environ-
mental problems.

“There is no impact on climate change that
can be reversed in hundreds of years,” he said.
“The trick is to stop it.”

Romm suggested that individuals consider
two things. First, he said that climate change

will affect many decisions. thatoccur in our A

lifetimes. Second, he said there’s‘ hope.
Romm said that other nationslhave already

begun adapting to global  referenc-

ing ﬂoating schools equipped  solar panels

in Bangladesh. Coping with rising sea levels

‘ and biannual ﬂoods, the country has begun

building schools that" ﬂoat and function as a.
combination of a school and a bus.
“It’s going to take a lot ofsmart people to

ﬁnd clever ideas to adapt to what we were too .

dumb to stop,” he said.

In his presentation, Romm said that the
most measurable impact of climate change has
been the loss of Arctic Sea ice. He said that the
Arctic Seahas lost 80 percent of its ice volume.

Romm explained that the amount of heat

released from the Arctic Sea as a result of melt-

ing ice is equal to the energy that the U.S. will
consume in ﬁveyears. _ «
“We can’t release that much energy without
changing the climate,” he said. .
He compared this problem to a medi
issue. ‘ . ' ~ ‘
Romm saidthat if one were to receive "a

    
 

1 medical diagnosis fortreatment —- even if

it took a lot of effort ‘——' most people would .
choose to receive the treatment. In the same
way doctors inform patients when they are
sick, he said that climatologists speak about
.; the unhealthy state of our planet. I ' V
“The people that are trying to convince
you that climate change isn't a_big problem
aren’t scientists,” Romm‘ said. “Your biggest
iregret will be not listening to the specialis .”

l Senior environmental studies major Hope
Comden said she agreed withthe validity of
Ro‘mm7s ideas. Shesaid that the most irnpor—

tant thing she -tookfrom the lecture was that
climatechange will affect us, regardless of

our actions. ' V

“It makes me nervous when I btjng climate

 change up, and rnyfriends sweep it under the

carpet,” she said; ‘‘It’s scary to think howsoon

' he andlquickly  happen.” ' ; ;

by-case basis.

“There are certain precedents that aren’t
necessarily written down,” he said.

Louderback explained that these .“gray ar-
eas” can be justiﬁed based on the nature of the
request, history of the club and standpoint of
the Board in ofﬁce at the time. For instance,
he indicated that Pitt Feel Good — a student
organization that sells grilled cheese and do-
nates the proceeds to the World Hunger Project
—— presents a “unique request.” The groups
request of food supplies to sell sandwiches
and then donate the money earned to a global
initiative is not in line with the Allocations
Manual because food is a disposable entity.

“It’s not as typical as a conference request
or a club sport competition,” he said. “It’s not
something we can generalize in the Alloca-
tions Manual.”

N ites identiﬁed provisions for alcohol and
deﬁcit spending as “black-and-white rules.”
But, he said, if the Board does not respond
to a request in the appropriated time, com-
pensating a group for deﬁcit spending could
be an option in order to rectify the Board’s
mistake. Deﬁcit spending occurs when a stu-
dent organization requests funding ‘beyond
its yearly budget. ,

For instance, last semester Nites called
off a meeting, delaying requests. Because a
group had already submitted a request for
funding and the cancellation was the Board’s

fault, the Board agreed to fund the event after
it had occurred.

Another rule exists regarding conﬂict
with the PPC. A student organization cannot
request funding for a Valentine’s Day event
because of an annual event hosted by the
PPC. This past February, the council offered
a screening of “Magic Mike” and distributed
100 roses. If another group had asked for mon-
ey for a Valentine’s Day event and the Board
chose to follow the guidelines of the manual,
it would deny the request and encourage the
organization members to attend the screening,
according to Nites.

But the execution of the same rule can be-
come murky. While the PPC hosts several ski
trips each year, Nites said that the Board funds
the Ski and Snowboard club because members

“fulﬁll a speciﬁc role on campus.” The Board _

justiﬁes these exceptionsbased on the value of
and need for the group as well as the organiza-
tion’s overall purpose.

The authority to allocate the funds. falls
in a hierarchical order similar to the way the
U.S. judicial system hears cases. First, student
organizations can appeal an SGB decision to
Milani, followed by Bonner and then lastly,
Humphrey. ‘This order of appeal cannot be

_ reversed. For instance, Bonner does not have

the ability to override a decision that Hum-
phrey has ﬁnalized.

“We don’t have that much policy,” said Maj-
chrzak. “It’s more of an advocacy. At the end of
the day, if Kenyon Bonner or someone were to
say that ‘that just can’t happen,’ then it can’t.”

<lFROM PAGE 1

DRUIDS

never forced to abstain from voting on a
funding request because of their afﬁliation
with a certain group. Rather, Majchrzak
said, committee members are customarily
all aware of each others’ involvement on
campus, enabling the group to self—police
in order to keep biases from inﬂuencing
its votes.

But Majchrzak noted that if a group
chooses to keep its membership a secret,
the resulting imbalance of information could
potentially lead to problems for the com-
mittee. '

“I think not disclosing all things you’re
involved in is wrong,” he said. “If you want
to be transparent, then you tell people what
they need to know, and you disclose it be-
cause that’s about being honest.”

Members of the Allocations Committee
serve as liaisons to assigned student orga-
nizations, working with and advising them
as they submit their applications request
for funding. The liaison then represents the
request when presenting it to the other 12
members of the committee who will vote
on it. If the request is less than $500, the
committee’s decision is ﬁnal. For requests
greater than $500, the committee presents
the proposal before the Board for ﬁnal ap-
proval.

In the past few years, students reported

as Druids have consistently sat on the Allo- ‘ ~~

cations Committee, although their presence
isn’t well—known by those who aren’t deeply
involved with the group.

Current Board member Thomas Jabro
and former Forbes slate campaign manager
Kate Malekoff were both on the'Allocations
Committee in the past and are believed by
some to be involved with the Druids. For-
mer Allocations Committee member Rosie
McKinley has stated that she was formally
involved with the secret society, but has since
left the group.

This year’s Allocations Committee in-‘
cludes Shivani Patel and Mimi Frisch, who
have been identiﬁed as Druids according to
earlier reports from former members of the
organization. ' -

“Considering all the information that

was ﬂoating around before I became Chair,
I already knew,” said Majchrzak in regard
to Patel and Frisch’s involvement.
V Majchrzak stated that although he is
aware of their involvement, he has never
observed them display any conﬂict of inter-
est or fail to show the objectivity required
of committee members.

Patel said allegations linking her to the
Druids have had no effect on her decision
making. .

“I have always acted on my own accord
based upon [my] own opinions, and- any
bias I may or may not have is left behind as
soon as I enter the conference room,” Patel
_said in an email.

Frisch echoed similar sentiments.
“I do my best to eliminate all bias I may

DRUIDS

have towards any group I am involved with
during allocations meetings,” Frisch said in
an email. “I am member of the committee
because I believe that it is important to help
student groups through the allocations pro-
cess and receive as much funding as possible.
Nothing stated in any Pitt News article about
my supposed affiliation with any group will
affect that belief and my dedication for the
rest of my term.”

But although their affiliation with a secret
group has complicated the process of inner-
group pressure helping committee members
avoid bias, Majchrzak said he doesn’t believe
it has had any negative effects on the com-
mittee or its members’ objectivity thus far.

“I truly believe this year and last year
didn’t have any problems with bias,” he said.

Board member Dave Rosenthal agreed,
saying the network that one gains from
being in the secret group is similar to the
networks that students make from being
involved in other student organizations.

“Having an association alone does not
mean that you should remove yourself from
the voting,” said Rosenthal, recalling his
time on the Allocations Committee. “For
instance when someone in my fraternity
presented a request, I would still vote on
it because I had nothing to do with his or-
ganization.”

Board member Michael Nites agreed that

the impact of the Druids on the allocations
process has been minimal. But he noted
that ethical concerns exist when members
do not publicly disclose their involvement.

“I think that in an ideal scenario, any time
that you’re making a decision, you would dis-
close what possible perceived biases might
exist that might make people question [your]
ability to make such a decision,” he said.

Majchrzak affirms that although he has
not witnessed any instances of bias affect-
ing his committee’s decisions, committee
members should nonetheless be upfront
about their involvement with any and all
organizations.

“As someone involved in Student Govern-
ment Board, I think you are a representative
of the University and all of the University’s
students,” he said. “For someone to under-
stand that responsibility and obligation,
they should be honest in answering ques-
tions openly, not just behind closed doors.”

Majchrzak acknowledged that the ab-
sence of voting based on bias within this
year’s committee does not eliminate the
future possibility for involvement with the
Druids to affect future Allocation Committee

' members’ actions and appointments.

“There is groundwork for it,” said Maj-
chrzak, “And that fact would be addressed
if that groundwork became more than just
groundwork.”

Board President Gordon Louderback,
who has denied his membership in the Dru-
ids, according to an article published in The
Pitt News Wednesday, said that he thinks the

Allocations process “in general, is pretty
transparent.”

“Literally, everything other than the
brieﬁng that chairman Majchrzak gives to
the Board during our presentations, it’s all
out in the open,” said Louderback.

Members of the committee are not
mandated to share their involvement with
student organizations on campus. The com-
mittee, while aware of each other’s public
involvements, relies on the sharing of infor-
mation that takes place informally between
committee members or bases its knowledge
on what members put on their resumés as
applicants.

Louderback said that although there is
no explicit requirement in the Allocations
Manual or SGB Constitution for members
of allocations to make all of their involve-
ments public, the Allocations Committee
and its members do a good job of mitigating
any conﬂicts of interest or potential biases.

“The Allocations Committee is educated
enough to know when they should abstain,”
said Louderback, going on to state that the
committee handles it “very maturely.”

Members of the Allocations Commit-
tee, to whom allocations requests must be
submitted, are not required to disclose their
involvement with student organizations or
potential conﬂicts of interest once they be-
come committee members.

Although as committee chair, Majchrzak
cannot enforce policies that forbid speciﬁc
committee members from voting, he cited

_ a “pressure” that is put on committee mem-

bers by other committee members to abstain
from voting when their interests are too
closely aligned with those of the requesting
group. He said the policing of committee
members is limited solely to suggestions.

“It’s usually either because they’re good
friends with someone in the organization or
don’t know well enough about the request
to vote,” he said.

Majchrzak approximated that the com-
mittee votes on 15 requests per meeting,
estimated that only one or two of those re-
quests see abstentions.

Rosenthal, who served on the Alloca-
tions Committee this past academic year, de-
scribed the committee members’ autonomy
similarly, saying they weren’t required to
disclose membership in student organiza-
tions.

Louderback related the Allocations Com-
mittee’s system to that of the Board when a
vote is called for and a member might have
a conﬂict of interest.

“I take the same approach with the
Board,” he said. “You can’t force them, but
you can recommend.”

While several current and former SGB
members as well as the Allocations Chair
acknowledge that Druid aﬁiliation does
not affect the allocations process, there is
potential for involvement with the society
to impact other aspects of the committee’s
nature.

Nites, a former chairman of the Allo-
cations Committee, said that the problem
might not be with the committee’s decisions,

The ﬂaws in this documentary
are numerous and severe. First,
every woman reacted to the ﬁrst
drawing as an image of “how she
sees herself,” when she’s looking at
nothing but an artist’s rendering of
vague, subjective statements such
as, “My mom says I have a big jaw.”

It’s problematic that the art-
ist is a man because he not only
draws the women, but he walks
them through the experience of
describing themselves. His ques-
tions and prompts guide their re-
sponses. And he walks with them
as they View their portraits. He
participates.in their emotional re-
sponses. It is clearly problematic

launched various media cam-
paigns, including commercials
showing how the modeling ‘in-
dustry uses bright lights, make-
up, styling tools and Photoshop
to transform ordinary-looking
women into fashion models.

; It seems that Dove, a large
beauty product company, has
genuinely attempted to improve
the beauty and fashion industry’s

. portrayal of women while simul-

taneously sponsoring programs

Healthy body images and self-
gsteem. In the nearly ten years

started, it has called attention to «
_,a lot of issues — including the

widespread use of Photoshop
and other technology to create
ﬂawless images and thelack of
diversity among models featured

in advertisements -— that pervade

mainstream media.
However, Dove’s‘new, highly
publicized video does more to

their own appearances, varied,
but none of their comments were
particularly positive or conﬁdent.
One woman says, “My mom told
me that I have a big jaw;” another
woman sheds a tear as she de-
scribes her most distinctive fea-

ture as her “fat, rounder” face. But "

the strangers’ descriptions were

bones and expressive eyes.

Also, the women portrayed
in this video are conventionally
rather attractive. I doubt that most
of them have, for example, faced
appearance-based discrimination
when applying for jobs. The video
does not include women who are
overweight or who have visible dis-
abilities. While it’s true that people
who are conventionally attractive
can have insecurities that strongly
impact their lives, the airing of this

. sole narrative is marginalizing.

Finally, Dove's attempt at help-
ing these women discover their
“natural beauty” does exactly

a the opposite.. Instead, it portrays

appearance-focused insecurities
and self—consciousness as a part
of all women’s experiences. Feel-
ing insecure about one’s looks and
needing affirmation to feel beauti-
fulis not necessarily a normative

experience. There are so many

people who are conﬁdent and happy with
their appearances and their identities, just
as there are so many people who experience
insecurity over other issues. _

It is highly insulting for Dove to suggest
that women need help discovering they’re
attractive, thus, allowing them to feel happy.
There are so many people who do not need
‘to be told by a cosmetics company —— or any-
one — that “you’re more beautiful than you
_think you are.” The inclusion of women who
only harbor negative feelings about their
appearances sadly enforces the stereotype
that the company seeks ‘to change.

Finally, I must clarify that it is my last

intention to mitigate any person’s struggle
with building self—conﬁdence or establish-
ing an identity. We all must contend with
these challenges in some way during our
lifetimes. I also do not mean to seem judg-

V mental about these women’s reactions and

responses when describing their appear-
ances and viewing images of themselves.
In order to affect real change, Dove needs
to change its strategy regarding this portion
of its campaign. The company should start
by asking all types of people about what
makes them feel happy, proud and conﬁ—
dent. Our lives are not free of insecurity or
pain; however, identity and sense of worth
must not depend on judgments of physical
appearance.I . . _

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

To the Editor,

I was glad to see The Pitt News re-
porting on the current mayoral and City
Council races. As the Editorial Staff and
Rohith Palli have mentioned, very few
students tend to vote in the Pittsburgh
local elections. This is a_ sad truth, but it
is one that we can fix. There are tens of
1,0005 of students who are registered to
vote in this city and in an election that
will be determinedby a few thousand
votes —- if not less. It is important that
we take part in this civic duty.

A majority of college students will
head back home before the election.

That should not stop us from voting. It
only takes a few minutes to request an
absentee ballot and even less to fill one
out. You can request a ballot by ﬁlling
out a form found in Panther Central or
at the information desk of the Union. If
students start voting in local elections
in greater numbers, our concerns about
the city will be taken seriously. So once
again, let’s get out to vote and fill out our
absentee ballots.

Sincerely,
Noah Tankin

"The Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre will bring

the classic “Cinderella” to life this weekend at

sullied pastime in Brian Helgeland’s “42.”
Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) crawling
through the trenches of baseball’s traditional
segregation and prejudice makes for an in-
spirational and heartening story, even if the
often awkward, unwieldy dialogue slows it
down considerably. .
Dodgers owner Branch Rickey (Harrison
Ford) recruits Robinson, and after a short
stint in the minor leagues, the swift-footed,
hhot—tempered inﬁelder becomes the ﬁrst
African-American in professional baseball.
As the only black player in a league of more

ographer Septime Webre. The ballet tells the
story everyone knows and loves: Cinderella
overcomes a life of servitude, an evil step-
mother and stepsisters to ﬁnd her one true
love, Prince Charming.

Despite her rags and wicked stepfamily,
Cinderella deﬁnitely receives aﬁin upgrade
from her original portrayal inthe time-hon-
ored tale. - 7* ‘

“Everybody loves a love  and this one '

in particular is very family friendly,” said Ter-

While the traditional story remains for the

country play out on the diamond.

Some clever camera work makes for
powerful baseball action scenes. Baggy
jerseys are caked in mud. Players throw
with hunched backs and dropped elbows.
The line drives and small-ball—type’play that
once dominatedthe game replace the home
‘run-oriented, sluggish hacks of today. Social
commentary aside, the movie is nothing if
not authentically “baseball.”

For sports fans, “42” hits on many levels,

being made of glass, they’ve transformed into
enchanted pointe shoes. 1

Perhaps the biggest, and funniest, transfor-
mation is the portrayal of the evil stepsisters.
Though they’ve never been an attractive pair,
Webre has cast two male dancers —— at 6-foot-
2 and 6—and-4 inches— to play the villainous
duo. Webre plays on the tradition of dancing,
“en travesti,” which uses a gender—bending
role reversal to further characterize the out-
rageousness of the characters. Dolled up in
overﬂowing hoop skirts as well asloud, garish
makeup and wigs, the two men will supply a
heavy dose of laughs for the audience.

“Septime Webre incorporated a lot of great
comedy and has done an amazing j ob with the
stepsisters,” said Amanda Cochrane’, who plays
the part of Cinderella-. “N 0 matter how many
times people watch this ballet, there’s always
giggles throughout the entire studio when the
stepsisters are dancing.”

Cochrane has danced forthe past 20 years,
since the age of three, and noted just how im-
portant this role has been for her.

“Cinderella has always been one of my fa-
vorite fairy tales, so this is kind of like a dream
come true for me,” she said. “It’s a very touch-

and they will appreciate it for its adherence
to history. But Helgeland’s unwillingness to
drift from that history, while admirable, can
at times be frustrating. Several details -
such as the abrupt departure of manager Leo
Durocher (Christopher Meloni) before the

 

V team enters “the tempest” of a season —— feel

forced and out of place. Some concessions

for the sake of evenness and ﬂuidity wouldn’t .

have damaged the ﬁlm as Helgeland feared.

of Cinderella’s character. She’s very kind and

R giving despite what she’s surrounded by and

is a great role model for audiences of all ages.”

On the surface the production is beauti-
ful, chock full of humor and accompanied by
a talented orchestra and sweepingscore. An
unbelievable amount of work goes into a ballet

' performance such as this one — sometimes 1-
more than anyone might imagine. Cochranev

said that, at this point, the dancers are com-
pleting two run tl1roughs of the show per day,
ﬁve days a week.

Orr said audience members should be
prepared to see multiple pirouettes and big,
impressive jumps fromthe dancers, who cer-
tainly will not disappoint. ‘

“Ballet dancers have changed a lot in gen-
eral over the past 20, 30 and 40 years, and
it’s become a very physical art form,” he said.
“These dancers are surprisingly better than
most athletes in Pittsburgh because they use
all parts of their body, not just muscles, and a
lot of people are usually just in awe of the grace,

skill and strength that they have when they -

see the shows. It makes for very interesting,
unique [and] exciting performances.” ﬂ

Goats give listeners insight into pop music’s formulaic nature

Matt Singer and Ali L’Esperance
H/PTS Contributors

By now, any internet-savvy person keeping
abreast of the times is familiar with the
screaming goats making their viral rounds
on YouTube and other video sites. They’re
worth a chuckle, sure, but when they’re
cut into a popular song, they provide even
more laughter. Music videos featuring goat
screams shouldn’t be regarded as just an-
other outrageous Internet phenomenon,
but rather, as a chance to peer into the inner
workings of pop music through memes.

The best known goat of viral Internet
recognitionis the now infamous “screaming
goat” that made its breakthrough musical
appearance in a resampling of Taylor Swift’s
“I Knew You Were Trouble.” As she sings
about “lying on the cold hard ground” and
the bass gets ready to drop, the goat makes
a sharp interruption. T—Swift’s vocals fade
-out, and the goat’s high-pitched shriek ﬁlls
the aural range. ' I

The original screaming goat video boasts
a whopping 8 million views — more than
the combined view counts of the 2013 State
of the Union, the skittles walrus make-out
commercial, a video of a slow loris eating
a rice ball and Dom Mazzetti’s “Harlem
Shake” video. '

Each unique goat video meets differing
amounts of success. Some samples — such
as Whitney Houston’s “I Will Always Love
You,” in which the slight reprieve before
the chorus’ “and” sets the stage for the
synchronized duet of Houston’s high note)
and the goat’s scream —~ fall on the more
well—executed end of the spectrum. But a
staggering number of different goatvideos

‘Vb  I 
The ease with which go

still garner thousands of views —— even in
instances of mangled attempts to sample
goat sounds into a song. It’s a testimony
to the. incredible popularity of goat videos,
as its diffusion into the mainstream speaks
volumes regarding the original content.
It stands to reason that the most com-
mercially successful music can be dissected
and then patched back together with goat
sounds because the songs themselves are
not carefully constructed pieces of art or
ﬁnely tuned musical creations. The vast
majority of Billboard hits follow a formulaic

algorithm meant to produce noninvasive,
indiscriminate sounds that pander to the
largest common denominator possible.

Songs such as Carly Rae Jepsen’s “Call
Me Maybe,” which has its own goat remix,
are able to serve as canvasses because all
the bubblegum pop components that in-
trinsically make up their DNA are wholly
alterable. Almost any song that plays in
Market Central could be spliced with goat
screams, and the average freshman would
probably be none—the—wiser, still using the
Akoo request service to dial it in.

Even. though the goat screams are offen-
sive and unnatural to the ear, their absur-
dity strikes the same chords as formulaic
pop music. It isn’t meant to necessarily
sound good or showcase any sort of mu-
sical talent. It’s supposed to get stuck in
someone’s head, ﬁnd its way to a ringtone
MP3 or rack up YouTube views. Whether

. it’s goat-infused music videos or top hits on

the radio, the goal is the same. Both merely
represent different means to the same end.

sad day

Holo Pleasures, the latest EP from the ever-
mysterious entity and Coma Cinema side
project Elvis Depressedly, might be the
group’s most maturely formed release to

date. Fully embracing the dirty, bedroom-
style recording that characterized its earlier
releases,»the band ﬁnally found a way to get

out of the way of its own sound. Instead of .

masking their rudimentary recording meth-

_ ods, lead singer Matt Cothran and friends

use the gritty acoustics of their surround-
ings, and perhaps their circumstances, as
instruments on the EP.

It'doesn’t hurt that Cothran continues
to deliver some of the most stingy simple
lyrics out there. “Pepsi/coke suicide” rides
a brooding, noise-heavy guitar lead while
Cothran haunts listeners with lines such as,
“You have haunted my desire.” In the con-
text of a moody ambience set by the lack of
any professional mixing, these lines strike
a nerve that lingers for the duration of ‘the

God—fearing, cigar—smoking Rickey works
because only the most eccentric owner
would even consider desegregating base-
ball. And Boseman’s balance of ﬁerce stares
and disarming grins —— moments of con-
straint and moments of implosion —— do
well to reveal just the tip of the complexities
and conﬂicts that make up the iceberg of
Robinson’s character.

Not only does he have to play under the
thunderous roars of racist crowds at ev-
ery ballpark — not -to mention the ﬁling
cabinet full of received death threats —
Robinson contends with prejudice in the

locker room. It takes an entire ‘season of

grit, guts and stolen bases for Robinson to
win over some of his teammates and some
of the country. . ’
“There was something unfair at the
heart of the game I loved,” Rickey says in
a rare moment of composure and grace.
“You let me love baseball again.” '
It’d be doing the legend a dishonor to

portrayjackie Robinson as anything but a _

hero, and'Helgeland rises to the task with
a passionate and loyal biography. But, al~
though perhaps true to the "time, the pe-
riphery characters, such as teammates
and fans, are decidedly one-dimensional.
Without nuance you have no choice but to
love anyone who isn’t overtly racist.
Robinson’s at—bats in Philadelphia, un-
der an avalanche of racial slurs from the

Phillies’ manager, are painful and actually
infuriating to watch: in a word, effective.
Helgeland sacriﬁces ‘any opportunities to
subtly hammer in just how hostile white
Americawas to the game’s ﬁrst black player.

Only when Robinson’s wife, Rachel (Ni-
cole Beharie), wraps her arms around him
and puts" her chin on his shoulder, does
Robinson’s guard seem to drop. You see a
man, worn, weathered and in need of his
wife, rather than the immortal Jackie Rob-
inson. These moments, peppered diligently
throughout “42,” help temper theweighty

message and tone that dominate Rickey’s

office, the locker room and the batters’
box. Beharie’s elegance in every scene is a
nice break from a movie drenched with the
ugliness of segregation. You’ll welcome the
breathing room.

The movie has the spirit and vitality-
you’d expect from such a pivotal moment
in the Civil Rights Movement. Although
it could have beneﬁted from a smoother
script, “42” plays with your senses of shame
and hope, embarrassment and buoyancy —
not to mention frustration and fulﬁllment
— not unlike how Jackie Robinson got in
the heads of every pitcher he tormented.

entire EP until each track oozes with a sort of
dejected embrace of the lo—ﬁ nature. It’s hard
to deny that the tone of the album contains a
hint of sweet misery beneath it all, as though
Cothran is learning to smile sadly and accept
his misery. .

N 0 song proves this point more poignant-

course, until the lyrics set in. “Your purity

This song is a downer in the very best way.

The record lasts only about ﬁfteen min-_

to track and frankly, can only go on a single
rotation. Whereas you and your friends could

requires contemplation. Cothran’s dry and
to—the-point wit drowns listeners in a sort
of welcome sadness.

it previously bore. Yet the genre has survived,
albeit with an understanding that emo musi-
cians must overcome public perception in
order to gain a semblance of respect. Even
Elvis Depressedly’s name is a play on the
pop-culture association with the sound. But if
this release says anything, it’s that the artistic
merit of the genre is alive and well.

Holo Pleasures ﬁnds the band morphing
its 10 —ﬁ sadness into something fully formed.
It’s a complete project instead of a collage of
different sentiments crudely pasted together.
It’s no secret that these guys are sad, but
overthe span of their multiple EPs, they’Ve
found way to explore a seemingly tired motif

O‘ The /nw-S/we Way by LOW T T’ g i , generic, predictable sounds that welcome_

the goat screams with open arms. 4
Because the songs that viewers see spiced
up with goats are essentially propped up on
the same tropes ,that allow such songs to
be digested en masse, the goat sound can
take the place of another musical variable.
The scream ﬁts in because pop sounds are
combined and designed for broad appeal.
Since this music plays it safe and doesnit
utilize any sort of experimental production
that breaks away from the norm, count-
less hits constructed on the basis of mass-
‘ marketability are perfect for goat samples.
Just as the typical Internet viewer doesn’t
search for the meme with authentically
intelligent wit, choosing instead to favor
something with‘ more shock value and
general share-ability, pop music listeners
don’t look for the most uniquely talented
artists. Conformity to popular culture isn’t

rather, a happy coincidence that one’s pre-
ferred music is the most apt slate on which
to add some random audio sample -4 such
as a goat. ' T ’

On any given Saturday night, the replace.-
ment of Taylor Swift’s original “I Knew You
Were Trouble” with the “I Knew You Were a
Goat” probably wouldn’t disrupt any of the
general bump—n-grinding going on at a frat
party. People love pop music because it’s
simple and fun to share, just like goat videos.

Winning strea ends as doublde

Jasper Wilson
Asszstant Sports Editor

  
 

Pitt baseball snapped its winning streak
with the conclusion of the second game of ,
its doubleheader at Cost Field Wednesday
afternoon. , , ' ‘

The end of the streak, which began last
Tuesday and spanned six contests, came at
the hands of Coppin State (11-23). _

Game 1: Pitt 10, Coppin State 4 s 7-

The Panthers’ (26-10) offense had suc-
cess from the start, scoring the game’s ﬁrst
two runs in their ﬁrst turn at bat. As one-
half of a double ‘steal, junior Stephen Vranka
stole home to break the seal and put his
team up a run._ Not soon after, Casey Roche
crossed the plate thanks to a ﬁelder’s choice
hit by Steven Shelinsky.Its next time at bat,
Pitt tallied seven more runs. First, singles
by Vranka and Roche scored one and two,
respectively. The big contribution, though,
was a grand slam by Shelinsky, a redshirt
junior. . -

The Eagles would respond an inning
later with four runs hit off Jeff Kelly, who
went on to record his ﬁrst win of the season
in a complete game effort.

The senior did not_ allow any more runs
for the remainder of the game.

C-ABLER STYLE

NHL’s excess Winter Classic
games a bad idea

Dustin Gabler
Senior Stcyff Writer

‘ For most hockey players, especially Canadians,

there exists a fond memory of playing outside
on a frozen pond.

' “Each and every guy always remembers
back to those days [of playing outdoors] be-
cause they were so much fun — probably be-
cause if you won it was no different thanif you
lost,” Wayne Gretzky said in 2009 to ‘NHL.com.
“It was over and done with, and you got ready
for the next game the next day.” .   .

' 7 . So it shouldn’tl1av,e”vtaken 90 yearsrifor the
NHL to realize that huge potential exists in

expanding the game to the outdoors.
“Growing up, I played a lot outside,” Sidney

Crosby said in 2008. “When you see 70,000

people jammed into a stadium to watch hockey,
it’s a good sign. The atmosphere and environ-
ment, I don’t think you can beat that.”
Although it took the league so long to real-
ize this, itbecame apparent not only to Cros-

than 114,000 people have ﬁt in the stadium
before.

In addition to the originally planned Winter
Classic above, two games in New York City
— one at Yankee Stadium and one at MetLife
Stadium —- in preparation for the Super Bowl
in the metropolis and a game during Hockey
Weekend Across America between the Black-
hawks and Penguins. A

The second official Heritage Classic — the
Canadian versiomof the Winter Classic —— hav-
ing ﬁrst taken place in 2003 before its resump-
tion in 2011, will also be held.

And, as for the sixth game, here’s the kicker:
An outdoor game between the Los Angeles
Kings and Anaheim Ducks at Dodger Stadium
is set to take placejanuary 25.

Dodger Stadium is in Los Angeles — sunny
Southern California: Hockey is played on ice.

Now, I’m sure —— at least I hope — the
league has the technology to preserve the ice,
but some things just aren’t meant for everyone.

Doesn’t Los Angeles have enough? Beautiful
weather, beaches and two hockey teams that

“Each and every guy always
remembers back to those days [of
playing 0utd00rs].”

Wayne‘ Gretzky

by, but to all of the NHL executives that this
event could bring the sport out of the dreaded
fourth-place position it occupies in the eyes of
Americans. Hence the creation of the annual
Winter Classic game on New Year’s Day for
the 2008 season.

A yearly regular—season game, which draws
more than three times theamount of fans as a
regular-season game, gave the NHL an event
that no other major league can offer. It’s better
than the NBAfs Christmas Day games or Open-
ing Day in Major League Baseball.

‘ After the initial success, NHL commis-
sioner Gary Bettman made a no-brainer de-
cision and signed off on more Winter Classics
-— 2009 in Chicago, 2010 in Boston, 2011 in
Pittsburgh, 2012 in Philadelphia and they ulti-
mately canceled the 2013_ game in Ann Arbor.

The league canceled this year’s game be-
tween the Detroit Red Wings and Toronto
Maple Leafs because of the lockout. Since the
cancellation, the NHL’s greed has shown as
major media outlets reported that anonymous

sources claimed the league will have six games

in 2014..

Ann Arborwill host the 2014 game in front
of what will likely be the largest crowd to ever
watch a professional hockey game — Michigan

Stadium’s oﬂicial capacity is 109,901, and more

aren’t supported.

Plus, are the small number of Los Angeles
hockey fans really going to be excited that they
experienced an outdoor game if one of their
stars goes out with an injury because of the
poor ice conditions? I doubt it.

And how does this expand the NHL’s brand?
Nontraditional teams playing a winter sport
in a city with an average high of 68 degrees

. won’t attract hockey fans. The NHL has a better

chance of attracting people looking for a di-
saster, such as the people who watch NASCAR
races for the wrecks.

You can have too much of a good thing, and,
in typical NHL fashion, the league is taking
one of its few leg ups over the other leagues
and removing the signiﬁcance.

I think I can live with the NHL ruining the
signiﬁcance ofonly having one outdoor game a
year, but a game in Southern California makes
no sense. '

But why shouldl be surprised? This is the
league that won’t move teams out of south-

_ ern cities that don’t support the team when

average-sized Canadian cities would sell out
nightly. . ~

Best of luck handling the fallout, Mr. Bet-
tman. ﬂ ‘

PHILADELPHIA _ Sports is where we’re
supposed to be able to go to get away from
all this.

After September 2001 came October
2001. Baseball playoff games in New York
City were transformed into cathartic events

. _ places to gather and share the pain while
deﬁantly showing that our way of life was
not going to be changed.

Not by terrorists, not by bombs, not
ever. _

Even Monday’s Boston Marathon was
supposed to help heal a still-open wound.
Organizers scheduled 26 seconds of silence
before the start in honor of the 26 victims
of the school shooting in Newtown, Conn.
Parents of some‘ of the Newtown victims
were invited to sit in the VIP stands near
the ﬁnish line.

The ﬁrst bomb went off just across the
way. Normalcy was transformed in a literal
ﬂash into chaos and confusion and agony. . ..

As always, the best of us ran toward the

The Panthers evened the score the next

Coppin State an incredible amount of credit,

tors can’t ﬁgure out.

The Boston Marathon is an insidiously
perfect target for the kind of twisted mind
that wants to create maximum shock valu-e.
What makes the event so special is what
makes it so vulnerable.

It is a sporting event on the grand scale,
like the Super Bowl or the Kentucky Der-
by or the Masters. But unlike all of those,
where only the elite ever get to compete,
a marathon includes both world—.class ath-
letes and regular folk. There are profession-
als looking to set world records and those
on life journeys looking to prove something
to themselves. _

. It is held out in the open, turning one
of America’s great cities into the venue and
the scene of the post—race celebration. That
makes it great. It also makes it, by its na-
ture,impossible to secure completely.

It is held on Patriots’ Day, a holiday in
Massachusetts that will now forever be
celebrated with a minor chord of sorrow
in the mix. ~ = »

But it will be celebrated. There will be

a BostonlMarathon in 2014, and the guess .

is here that record numbers will run the
race. Because that is the ﬂip side of all this
brutality. It hurts. It maims. It kills. But it
can never be allowed to win.

After Sept. 11, it was impossible to play
NFL and major—league baseball games for
those ﬁrst few numb days. But then it was

not just possible, it was necessary. There
are a million ways to measure that life goes
on, but nothing that engagesjso many of us
simultaneously as our sports teams.

Of course, sports hasn’t always been
sacrosanct. The Olympics will never be
conducted without the shadow of the 1972
Munich massacre hovering. The Olympic
Park bombing in Atlanta attempted but
failed to derail the 1996 Summer Games.

After Sept. 11, 2001, there was a dread
that our sports venues could become tar-
gets. The Super Bowl in New Orleans the

’ following February was played under heavy

security. Going on 12 years later, we are still
accustomed to having our bags checked
on the way into an arena or ballpark or
stadium. g

. In 2004, the Knight Ridder newspapers
required everyone assigned to cover the
Athens Olympics_to travel to Washington
for special terrorism preparation training.
We learned what to do if a bomb went off,
if there was gas attack; the word “nuclear”
was used. Those Games, played in range
of the Middle East in the early going of
the Iraq War, felt like the world’s largest
bull’s—eye.

I remember covering the ﬁnal competi-
tion, thinking it was the ideal target _ wide
open, conducted all over an enormous city,
impossible to secure.

The marathon.

Nothing happened, and we all took one

~ more step toward returning to the day-to-

day complacency we consider normalcy.
