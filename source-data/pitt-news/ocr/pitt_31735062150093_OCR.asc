Early Deadline
For Students A

Announcement of “the openingg
rejuvenating gun” for the work of
the next-year’s Student Faculty As-
sociation came last Monday when Pat
Cusick, E40, newly-elected president,
called for candidates to work on
SFA committees.

Students wishing to apply for work
on the 14 SFA-sponsored committees
do not have to be members of the as-
sembly. They must have their ap-
plications in by Wednesday, May 17.

Petitions for committee assign-
ments are to be made in the form
of a note or letter to Cusick, in care
of the dean of men’s oﬁice. These let-
ters should indicate. preference for
general type of assignment and the
experience the applicant has had in
the ﬁeld in which he wishes to work.
14 COMMITTEES

At present, the 14 commi.ttees func-
tioning include the SFA social com-
mittee, the SFA Appointments com-
mittee, the football demonstration
group, parking and trafﬁc, concert,
forum, movie, senior memorial, pep
assemblies, student directory, build-

high school relations, and the schol-
ars’ day committee.

Cusick pointed out that this list of
committees may be modiﬁed by either
dropping some of the existing groups
or adding additional committees.

Asserting that the “success or fail-
ure (of the coming SFA projects) be-
gins now with the formation of em-
cient and hard working committees,”
Cusick asked that students desiring
to participate in the various phases

of student government apply for
work.
QUALIFICATIONS

He emphasized that much depends
upon placing the students with the
proper qualiﬁcations upon the proper
committee. _

Nature of the work to be done by
the various groups is shown by the
following partial listing duties. These
duties include “. .
of the routine work of social f«1nc-\
tions . . . the interviewing of appli-H
cants and the recommending to thes
Executive Committee the best of the»:
candidates for various comniitteel
chairmanships - . and the planning’
and conducting of pep meetings be-

About the time high heels and
skirts were being shed by University
“danseurs” in the Nixon theater last
Saturday midnight, a telephone was
ringing in the Princeton, N. J., offices
of the American Institute of Public
Opinion. “Station-to-station for Mr.
Don Saunders,” the operator said.

Speeding by airplane to the Mageev

“Best in many a year,” the slogan¢

attributed to the 1939 Cap and Gown
show, “At Your Service,” by its pub-
licity staff before presentation, and
the statement made by critics, stu-
dents, and alumni after seeing the
show, was borne out by the boxofﬁce
ﬁgures, according to Theodore Biddle,
graduate manager.

10,768 persons saw “At Your Serv-
ice” during its seven-day run. The
total ﬁgure includes, besides six
nights at the Nixon theater, an at-
tendance of approximately 2,900 at
the Shriners’ Syria Mosque preview‘.
Approximately 1,100 Westinghouse
employees appeared for Westinghouse
night on Tuesday.

“We mightn’t have broken any ad-
mission records,” Biddle said, “al-
though the 1,604 ﬁgure for Friday
night is the largest Cap and Gown
attendance in my recollection.”

Wednesday night, with 1,438 ad-
missions, was closely followed by
Alumni night, Thursday, 1,398, and
Saturday, 1,361. Inasmuch as the to-
tal seating capacity of the Nixon, ex-
cluding the second balcony, where
few seats were sold, is only 1,380, “At
Your Service” averaged an audience
of 97 per cent capacity.

l‘l:1_\'c1~s’ fourtli presentation of
the season, will be at 8:30 o’clock
toni,c'ht in the Stephen Foster Mo-

the Spring Festival Week events.
The Thornton Wilder Pulitzer Prize
play is being given by an amateur
audience for the first time. The pro-
duction is under the direction of
Buell Whitehill, instructor in speech.
NOVEL TREATMENT

Several features of the show are
combined to make it an “attractive
part of the festival week,” both the
Players’ and Spring Festival staffs
declare. The novel treatment by
Wilder calls for a bare stage on
which, with the aid of authentic cos-
tumes, subtle lighting, a choral group,

and pantomine, the actors present’

their theme.

Action of the play takes place from
in Grover’s Corners,
New Hampshire. Here, described by

' stage manager Earl Riley, C39, the

audience sees much of the home life
in the families of the Gibbs; William
McElwain, C41, and Alice Jahn, F-d39,
and the Webbs; Georgetta Davis,
136.40, and Frank Miller, C41.

Peggy Megee, C40, plays Emily
Webb.
TICKET SALES

Other characters, besides the off-
stage choral group of a dozen voices,
and a large number of extras, include
Edna Kauffman, BA40, as Mrs.
Soames; Ed Ravick, BA42, Joe Cro-
well; Joseph Burkley, C41, George
Gibbs; mid Bud Shapiro, C42, as
Wally C-ibbs.

Tickets will be available for
p—e1’forinance at the
floor tit:-ke‘t booths until 3:30 o’clock
today. and at the performance this
evening for 50 cents each. Two tick-
ets are included in each Spring Fes-
tival Week booklet.

In conjunction with Spring Festival

Cashdollar, BA39, student chairman.

Campus “queens” will circulate

With a take-off on “leading na-

Carnival Night and on Friday.

Slightly embarrassed by the un-
timely end of Scribner’s, which
ceased publication last week, and
is one of the “leading magazines”
receiving Panther recognition
through parody, the Panther sach-
ems hope that the other magazines
being imitated; Time, Reader’s Di-

at least until after the Panther hits

The music column will be done

Editor’s Diary I

l According to headlines in our daily paper, witnesses
before the Senate Committee on Education and Labor,
now holding hearings on proposed amendments to the
Wagner Act, are calling the Act and the National Labor
Relations Board everything from an “insidious evil” to
“public enemy No. 1.” It seems that every time we
pick Llp the “Final Stocks” edition, somebody is publicly

‘F laying’ the Poor Labor Board . . .

and its membership of three, headed by ex-Pitt law
professor J. Warren Madden.

Knowing Dr. Madden, we somehow can’t believe all
these wild statements. To us, he is neither the wild-
eyed radical some would like us to believe, nor is he
the tool of “unscrupulous labor interests.”

We remember Dr. Madden as a quiet, unassuming
sort of person, doing his work efficiently, in the most
unobtrusive manner possible. In
fact, before he became associated
-with the Labor Board in 1935, he

servative by some of his faculty

We can remember that hot Sat-
urday afternoon in May when, we,
as a sophomore reporter, climbed
the long flight of steps to And-
over Terrace on an assignment to
interview Dr. Madden. We found
him in old pants and sweatshirt,

 

Dr. Madden
digging in his background ﬂower garden.

He was a hard man to interview, because he was so
quiet and hesitant to talk about himself. But between
jabs at the Schenley terrace hillside with his hoe, we
recall how Madden told us that he thought “a spirit of
industrial democracy” was pervading America.

We couldn’t quote the rest of the interview very ac-
curately, but we have never forgotten that “industrial
democracy” statement. Now, two years later, it seems
to us that every attempt is being made to prohibit any
furthering of such an ideal.

For, in the Washington hearings, the reactionary U.
S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of
lvlanufacturers, and the American Federation of Labor
are gauging up on the Board and the Wagner Act, be-
cause of recent policies, which, the opponents claim,
have been biased in favor of labor, and especially in
favor of one labor group. To us,

The ‘Bias’ A.i'g1ii11e11t . . .

indicates an ignorance of the very purpose of the Wag-
ner Act. If any of the law’s critics would take the time
to read the text of the act, they would discover that the
purpose of the act is plainly stated to safeguard the
right of EMPLOYEES to self-organization and to select
representatives of their own choosing for collective bar-
gilllllllg or other mutual protection without 1'esti:'aint or
coercion by the employer.

Thus, the act is deﬁ.nitelj biased to begin with, and
i"igli‘:;‘i;-,7 so, we think. For it is obvious that, in these
days of large—scale industrialization, the individual
wo:rkei3 is no longer the economic or bargaining equal
of the employer . He must bargain collectively, that is,
tl‘ir<:>u.gli unions free from employer domination, if he is
to have any voice in the conditions of his work.

Evert the Supreme Court (in 1937, before it had 
present liberalized makeup) recognized that fact.

The theory behind the act is, that by giving cm-
ployees legal recourse to settle their grievances with the
employers, the great majority of strikes and other “labor
trouble” may be averted.

It is, therefore, interesting to note that AFTER the
Supreme Court’s favorable decision in 1937 (and em»-
ployers, consequently, decided it was futile to di;si'egai'd
the law any longer), there has been a decided -:1ecreas-e
in the number of strikes.

Public Opinion . . .

has been cleverly molded into anti-labor board senti-
ment by a minority of the six per cent of cases which
come up for hearing. Generally unknown however is
the fact that 94 per cent of the 16,000 closed cases since
the inauguration of the board in 1935 have been adjust-
ed before reaching the stage of formal hearing. Forty-
two per cent of these cases, either dismissed for lack of
evidence or withdrawn, deﬁnitely favored the employer.
An additional 52 per cent were settled by voluntary
agreements.

Another charge, mainly attributed to the A <L, is that
the board has shown favoritism ‘toward the CIO. Since
the board’s inception ﬁgures show that in the 48 most
important cases over the a_op':opriate bargaining unit, 2-}
were settled in favor of the AFL, 19 for the CV0, .:-ind
the remaining five were compromises with the Al-‘L
ga.iniii.g slight advantage in four of 'Llici.n.

We’re really concerned about all this. It seems evi-
dent that the real intent of a 1'.-ugge number of ‘die
Wagi1er:—‘-i4t‘ct’s critics is not to amend it, but to minuscu-
late and thereby kill. it.

We also feel that Chairman lV'la.dden and the board
haven’t been given a fair 13 ‘e-ak. They have really per-
formed a man-sized job which will remain in the history
books long after the vittipeintive speeches of some un-
reasoning reactionaries have been forgctteiz.

they ﬁrmly maintain that this eco-

they think that the Allied powers

To F iii Crown

Tomorrow afternooii in Pitt,
Stadium is the big moment in this '
_\'ear‘s fi'aternit_\” athletics—the
annual spriiig festi *al track meet.

Phi Gaiiiiiia Delta is det’eiie_liiig'
champion. but Delta Tau Delta,
victor in last winter"s indoor ineet,.
should be conceded the edge now.

From their indoor team, the Delts
return champions to competition in
the shot put and high jump, as well
as a host of other sure point winners.

Phi Ganima Delta, title-holders in
last year’s festival meet, will be a
deﬁnite threat. The Fijis, who placed
second to the Delts indoors, took four
ﬁrsts last summer.

Earl Pressel, who copped the high
jump and 220 yard dash, besides run-
ning one leg on the winning 880 re-
lay, will be the Phi Gam’s main
threat; while the Delts, nothing but
also-rans last year, are now bolstered
by the addition of several new men,
notably footballer Benghauser.

Last year’s feature was Peace vs.
Konetsky in the shot put; both boys
are still with us.

Past I-F track meets have gener-
ally granted nothing to the form
sheet, however, and this one promises
to be no different. Besides the
natural turnover of winners (only
one frater, Frank Engel of PiKA,
successfully defended his title last
year), another factor may change the
ﬁnal result. Along with the “bigger
and better” spring festival, there has
developed a new spirit toward all of
its events, and not the least of these
is the Interfraternity Track Meet.

Nearly all the hats are entering
full teams, with the result that this
year’s meet should be better than
ever.

I ndiania Squad Saturday

since his sudden collapse last Satur-
day against the West Virginia nine.
Haluska coasted along with a 4-0 lead
during the first ﬁve innings, but fell

apart in the sixth to yield three dou-
bles and a home run before being
lifted in favor of Joe Triola.

The other half of the Pitt battery
is still uncertain although Gabby
Hartman is the likely starter. Hart-
man had caught steadily until the
second Mountaineer match, when he
was replaced for the day by Guy
C-uadagnino, erstwhile ﬁrst baseman.

Gu.adagnino’s contribution was
three wild throws and deﬁnite defi-
ciency in base hits, but he showed
erugugh in his first start to warrant
the belief that he may give Hartman
a stiff fight for the job during the
rest of the season.

Eddie Straloski is gradually devel-
oping in the Panthers’ chief offensive
threat. His eft‘o_rts last Friday netted
two singles, a double, and a run
batted in, while on Saturday he
sinaslicd  single and homer to drive ,
in two runs. l

Defensively too, he is on the up-
grade, liaiiclliiig nearly everything on i
his side of the diamond. With relia-
ble Bob Foliart on third, the Mitter-
lingmeti have a close to i.inpi‘cgiiabl.e
defense on the left side of the dia-
inc-nd.

Joe Gillespie will probaoly be be-
hind the bat for the Statei's, and Walt
Kniaz, Captain Ray Brake, anrgl Gerry
Gates will make up the outﬁeld,
Menzie will be on third, Hairbreadth
Harry Harrison at short, sophomore
Eddie Sapp at second, and Art Seibel
on ﬁrst.

Still seeking their first win of the
season, Pitt’s varsity netmen duel
with Duquesne University’s tennis
team at 2:30 o’clock today on the
Trees Gym courts.

The Blue and Gold netters have
their racquets loaded for today’s bat-
tle with Duquesne, since Pitt’s
chances for retaining the city net title
would be considerably enhanced by
a win over the local rivals.

The line-up will be almost the

Anti-Tuberculosis Sests

Estimates Total

Response at 300

“Tubercu1in test response has been
under par,” telephoned Dr. Paul Zeh-
fuss, assistant director of the men’s
health service, to The News yester-
day. “Only 45 men were injected
Monday.”

By 4:45 o'clock Monday, a four-day
total of 300 men had taken ﬁrst
strength anti-tuberculosis tests. The
injections will continue throughout
today.

Second strength tests will be given
tomorrow and Friday. X--ray exam-4
inations are going on continuously.

Athletes and all would-be-athletes
are advised by Dr. Zehfuss to take
the tests. “The disease is particularly
destructive among these groups of
students who indulge in strenuous
activities,” he said.

Women’s health service has post-
women until next
Monday.

No appointments are needed for
these free tests conducted on campus
by the health services and The News.
X-rays, however, can be only made
for two dollars, a price set by the
Clinic as approximately one-seventh
of the professional charge, and much
less than even the cost of niateriziis

Federal Education Office Claims

College Graduates Do Find Work

WASHINGTON, D. C.—(ACP)——¢
Despite the popular surveys to the
contrary, college graduates are not
so bad off as many have you believe
according to a report just issued by
the U. S. Oﬂice of Education after a
year of intensive research.

Following are excerpts from the
report:

During the eight—year period of the
survey, about two-ﬁfths reported
that they had been idle for one or

more months since graduation. But
57.8 per cent of the men and 60.7
per cent of the women reported that
they have not been idle since gradu-
ation.

More than 98 per cent of the alum-
ni reported that they have never
been on public relief, but the typical
period of relief is only six months.

Eight years out of college, 31 per
cent of the men graduates own their
own businesses, while less than one
per cent are employed as unskilled
laborers.

The average salary, after eight
years of employment, is slightly more
than $2,400 for the men and more
than $1,600 for the women who are
graduates of institutions that have
more than 3,000 enrollment. Grad-
uates of the smaller schools earn
less.

Exactly 64 per cent of the men
and 55 per cent of the women in-
cluded in the survey report a close
connection between their present em-
ployment and their college major.

Those surveyed indicated that “the
most advantageous way for a gradu-
ate to ﬁnd work after college is
through an active personal solicita-
tion.

Collegiate Polls
Reveal Opinions

That college students are think-
ing about something else besides the
current international situation is re-
ﬂected in the results of polls taken
on many campuses. Here are the
results of a few of the most interest-
ing:

On goldﬁsh gulping: Tulane Uni-
versity students voted 5 to 1 against
the current wave of eating stunts
that has swept over the nation’s cam-
puses.

On a third term for President
Roosevelt: College of William and
Mary undergraduates 80 per cent
strong voted against the idea, al-

tough 63 per cent indicated that
they believe he has been a good chief
executive.   '

On politics: Manhattan College
seniors voted the Republican party
their favorite political organization
and named Thomas E. Dewey as their
candidate for the presidency.

On business: Gettysburg students,
by a vote of 206 to 185, believe that
business should not be restricted so
much by government.

On favorites: Fordham University
seniors paired up Hedy Lamarr and
Robert Browning as the most popular
of all men and women.

On old age pensions: University of
Maine students voted 4 to 1 against
the Townsend plan.

On dance orchestras: Iowa State
Teachers College undergraduates, by
a 5 to 1 majority, believe that Kay
Kyser is the tops. Those polled voted
overwhelmingly in favor of Hoagy
Carmichael’s “Star Dust” as their
favorite tune.

Five Addresses
At High Schools

Dr. Samuel H. Williams, professor
of biology and South American ex-

plorer, will deliver commencement
addresses at ﬁve high schools in the
Pittsburgh district during the next
three weeks.

Dr. Williams, who is a member of
Phi Delta Kappa, honorary profes-

nationally known for his work in the
ﬁeld of education. He has been men-
tioned as a possible successor for
George Ade. former State Secretary
of Education, who retired May 1.

Speaking on the subject, “Educa—
tion, the Individual, and Society,” Dr.
Williams will address the students of

 

Rimersburg-Madison high school,

Durkiin Revises
Scholars’ Day

Requirements

In the future all students tapped
on Scholars’ Day must have a min-
imum quality point average of 2.0
for all subjects, announces Francis
Durkin, BA39, chairman of this
year’s Scholars’ Day program.

This ruling was adopted by the
committee after consulation with the
deans of the various schools and some
of the faculty advisers of the hon-
orary fraternities.

“This means,” said Durkin, “that
all scholastic honoraries wishing to
participate in the Scholars’ Day pro-
gram must have a minimum require-
ment of a 2.0 average in all subjects
for all tappees.”

This question was raised recently
by honorary groups that had been
participating in the Scholars’ Day as-
semblies. Several of these fraterni-
ties have a high minimum scholastic
requirement for members in their
major subject, but a requirement be-
low 2.0 in their minor.

This plan of a minimum 2.0 general
average attempts to correct this sit-
uation, according to Durkin. Hon-
crary fraternities that wish to only
require a 2.0 average in their ma-
jor subject, will not participate in
the tapping ceremonies in the fu-
ture.

BBR Attributes Slump
In Business to Strikes

Because of the almost complete
stoppage of bituminous coal produc-
tion in Pennsylvania, business in the
Pittsburgh district slumped severely
during April, according to the Uni-
versity Bureau of Business Research.

The index of industrial production
fell from 86.7 per cent of the 1923-25
average in March to 65.5 per cent in
April.

Closing of the mines was indirectly
responsible for most of the drop in
the volume of originating freight
shipments and retail sales, no doubt,
were adversely affected through re-
duced payrolls, the Bureau reported.
