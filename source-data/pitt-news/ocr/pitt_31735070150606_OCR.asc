For The Pitt News

A Pitt social work professor is
among 5,000 individuals named
on a sexual predator blacklist
put together by the Boy Scouts of
America.

The Boy Scouts blacklisted Rod-
ger L. Beatty in the organization’s
“perversion ﬁles” after accusations
of Beatty sexually molesting ﬁve
members of Troop 222 —— ranging
in age from 13 to 14 — surfaced
in 1976. In these ﬁles, the Scouts
organization compiled names of
the accused persons between 1947
andjanuary 2005.

Beatty, 66, is recovering from a
stroke and subsequent coma suf-
fered in late September. With the
reports coming in, his family asked
family friend and fellow professor,
David Korman, to speak on Beatty’s
behalf.

Korman directed questions to
Shayla Anthony, a relative of Be-
atty. She said that he is now awake,
but not able to communicate.

“Rodger is slowly recovering,”
Anthony said. “We’re hoping to get
a second side of the story soon.”

The ﬁle was made public by
Portland, Ore'., attorney Kelly
Clark, who used the ﬁles in a sex-
abuse lawsuit against the Boy
Scouts. A judge deemed the ﬁles
proper evidence. '

The Boy Scouts released a state-

ment that said, “the ﬁles are a list
of people who do not meet the
BSA’s membership standards be-
cause of known or suspected abuse
or other inappropriate conduct ei-
ther inside or outside of scouting.”

Obama, Romney battle over foreign policy

   
 

President Baracklobama (right) and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney spoke about for-

eign policy at the final campaign debate Monday night. MCT Campus

Pat McAteer
Assistant News Editor

President Barack Obama peppered
Republican presidential nominee
Mitt Romney with accusations of
“ﬂip-ﬂopping” on his foreign views
during their third and ﬁnal campaign
debate Monday night at Lynn Uni-
versity in Florida.

A week after Obama’s campaign
adopted the term “Romnesia,” which
refers to what they’ve called political
opportunism on the part of Romney,
the president brought the assault
on the former Massachusetts gover-
nor’s record to a national audience.

The ﬁnal debate was dedicated
to foreign policy, and it served as
the ﬁnal opportunity for the two
candidates to challenge each other
face—to—face before Americans will
cast their votes on Nov. 6. And with
unrest in the Middle East and China
continuing to emerge as a power,
the next country’s leader will have
various issues to deal with in inter-
national relations.

“You’ve said that ﬁrst we should
not have a timeline in Afghanistan,
then you said we should,” Obama
said. “Now you say maybe or it de-
pends, which means not only were

you wrong, but you were also con-

fusing and sending mixed messages

both to our troops and our allies.”
Romney largely shrugged off

-Obama’s attacks and criticized the

presidentfor attacking his stances as
opposed to establishing a concrete
plan for the Middle East.

“Attacking me is not an agenda.
Attacking me is not talking about
how we’re going to deal with the
challenges that exist in the Middle
East and take advantage of the op-
portunity there and stem the tide of
this violence,” Romney said. ,

But more so in their previous de-
bates, Obama and Romney seemed
to be in a agreement on many issues
offered up by moderator Bob Schief—
fer of CBS News — most notably on
the issue of relations with Iran, a
country that has come under ﬁre
by U.S. officials for its hard—line ap-
proach with Israel.

Romney said he advocated for
the economic sanctions placed on
Iran by the U.S. and other nations,
but proposed “tightening” the sanc-
tions already in place by preventing
cargo ships carrying Iranian oil from
entering U.S. ports.

His views largely aligned with
those of Obama’s, who said the eco-

nomic sanctions caused the value of
the Iranian currency to drop 80 per-
cent, leaving the country’s “economy
in shambles.”

Despite the agreement in their
stances on Iran, Romney blasted

~ Obama for a proposed budget plan

that he said eliminates $1 trillion in
ftmding toward the military. Romney
added that the U.S. Navy’s ﬂeet is at
its smallest since 1917, with only 285
ships remaining.

In jest, Obama said the U.S. mili-
tary also had fewer “horses and bay-
onets” than they did in the past, and
the government needed to focus on
retooling their forces.

“We have these things called air-
craft carriers, where planes land on
them. We have these ships that go
underwater, nuclear submarines,”
Obama said. “And so the question is
not a game of Battleship, where we’re
counting ships. It’s —- it’s what are
our capabilities.”

The two men also continued their
ongoing debate over trade policy
with China. Taking a ﬁrm stance on
the issue, Romney said he’d declare
China a “currency manipulator” on
his ﬁrst clay in ofﬁce. When Schieffer

local bar

reopens to

can breathe a sigh of relief af-
ter one popular Oakland bar’s
reopening.

' Pittsburgh Cafe, a bar located
on Meyran Avenue, reopened
last week following its closure
because of an alleged failure to
pay the county’s tax on alcoholic
beverages.

The bar originally closed on
Oct. 3, according to ofﬁcial court
documents, because the estab-
lishment owed the county nearly
$13,000 in fees and penalties.

Bob Miecznikowski, the man-
ager of Allegheny County’s Spe-
cial Tax Division, conﬁrmed that
the bar reopened sometime last
week. He said that the county and
Pittsburgh Cafe had settled the
issue, and the bar was allowed
to reopen.

However, he declined to
elaborate, saying that his office
keeps any information related to
taxes conﬁdential. He added that
such information could be used
by competing businesses.

He declined to state specifi-
cally when the bar reopened, say-
ing only that it happened some-
time last week, and also would
not say whether the bar paid the
amount in full or worked out, an
agreement with the county to pay
in installments.

Attorney Jake Lifson, of the
law firm Goehring, Rutter and
Boehm — which represented
the county in the case —— also
declined to comment.

Correction: In Monday’s article “Students help community on PMADD,” The Pitt News incorrectly reported the increase in turnout for the event since last year. There were 500
more participants this year than last. Also, this year’s participants did not assemble safe sex kits for the Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force. The Pitt News regrets the errors.

DEBATE

followed up his question by asking Romney
whether an aggressive move of that nature

_ would cause a “trade war,” Romney pointed

toward the trade imbalance that already exists
between the two nations.

“We have an enormous trade imbalance
with China. And it’s worse this year than last
year. And it was worse last year than the year
before,” Romney said.

But Obama dismissed Romney’s classiﬁ-
cation of the trade relationship between the
U.S. and China, saying that currency value and
trade balance have improved during his four
years in office.

“With respect to what we’ve done with Chi-
na already, U.S. exports have doubled — since I
came into oﬂice — to China,” Obama said. “And
actually, currencies are at their most advanta-
geous point for U.S. exporters since 1993.”

The topic of the use of unmanned drones,
which received major attention after The New
York Times released an article revealing ram-

pant drone warfare on the part of the Obama
administration in Pakistan, surfaced for the
ﬁrst time in Monday’s debate.

Schieffer didn’t direct the question to 4

Obama, but instead asked Romney if he sup-
ported the use of drones. He responded that
he “supported entirely” the use of the weapons
in the Middle East to prevent the deaths of U.S.
military members.

Although the debate focused on foreign
policy, the back-and-forth between Obama and
Romney reverted back to the state of the U.S.
economy on multiple occasions. Obama touted
his administrati_on’s credentials, saying that
his policies have helped revive the economy
and add jobs. P

But Romney said his policies as president
would generate a more robust economic re-
covery as well as reduce the nation’s national
debt signiﬁcantly. '

“I’ll get people back to work with 12 mil-
lion new jobs. I’m going to make sure that we
get people off of food stamps not by cutting
the program but by getting them good jobs,”
Romney said. I

til this point, Wayne Perry, the organization’s
national president, admitted that sexually
inappropriate acts did take place and were
not properly handled by the Scouts.
“Where those involved in scouting failed

to protect, or worse, inﬂicted harm on chil— I

dren, we extend our deepest and sincere

apologies to victims and their families,”
Perry said in a statement released fromthe _

Scouts. -
Even though one-third of the incidents

‘ go unreported, the organization still ﬁnds

the lists useful. Many blacklisted members
were accused of pedophilic acts ‘in more
troops than just their own. '

Since then, a statement released from the
Scouts assures that national scout leaders
prohibit scoutmasters from being alone with
a scout, and that the Boy Scouts of America
have implemented stricter policies than
those that were in place in the 1980s.

The press release listed the current po1i- .

 

cies, which require any suspicion of abuse
to be reported and background checks and
screenings for all adults involved in the or-
ganization. 9

One of the accused who went under the
radar was Beatty — at the time a drug and al-
cohol abuse counselor —— who victims allege
picked up and left town after the victims gave
detailed, written statements to the troop.

Beatty picked back up again by working
for the state Department of Health beginning

in 1978 and helping found an_AIDS assistance A
« group in Harrisburg, Pa., in 1982, according

to his biography on Pitt’s website.

Beatty received a master’s degree in social
work from Penn State in 1983 and a doctor-
ate from Pitt in 1997. He settled in Pittsburgh
as a Pitt social worker and AIDS researcher.
He was known as an activist among the LG-
BTQ community. H \

Andrew Kaback
C'0lumnz'st

Thank you. Thank you. Please be
quiet because my hand is starting
to hurt from waving. Thank you
and welcome to the Political Con-
vention of Politics. 1 was so happy
when I was asked to come speak,

S because I was a little worried that

people didn’t think that I was an
important ﬁgure anymore. Luckily,
you guys do, so I am very relieved.

Tonight I am here to pretend
to endorse a candidate. I don’t
actually believe that this is the
best guy we can put up in the race
because, as is obvious, I exist. I
will be a great president once you
all understand how effective my
speech- giving skills are. I will em-
phasize the use of hand gestures
and rhetorical questions, so that
you can all understand how'iVncred-
ibly passionate I am about my own
abilities. ‘   ‘I

I think that it is also important
for you to know that I am a loving
mother, father and grandchild.
Look at these shots of my children

and elderly relatives. You can tell
that I am a strong candidate be-
cause they are so cute. My grand-
mother used to tell me as a child,
“Use me for your political gain,”
and I decided that it couldn’t screw
up the kids any to just expand on
that principle.

It’s also important for you all to
know which state I am from. I was
born on a Colorado ranch before
attending university in Ohio, I now
divide my time between my “out-
side the Beltway” home in Virginia
and my Florida vacation home that
is impressive but not ﬂashy.

So what is this election that we
have here? Well, there are some
policy differences between our
party and that of our opposing
one. We disagree on social issues,
regulation of ﬁnancial markets,
tax rates, entitlement programs,
foreign policy and overall direc-

g tion of the country, but that doesn’t

really matter. What does matter is
this out-of-context quote from the
other guy that was said 7 years ago.

a Yes, he really did say that!

Luckily I have been blessed with

the unique quality of understand-
ing exactly what every Founding
Father intended to say. Not try-
ing to brag here, but the ghost of
George Washington and I are on a
nickname basis. You should have
seen his tweet the other night; hi-
larious guy. Upon close inspection
of the Federalist Papers, it’s pretty
clear that our party is the one that
will make this country what it was
supposed to become.

I also believe in a little thing
called the American Dream. It’s the
greatest thing that we have —— the
hope that tomorrow will be better
than today. Let’s be real, though,
the only way that this could pos-
sibly happen is if you vote for my
candidate. If you vote for the other
guy, everything that you now own
and love will disappear the day af-
ter the election.

Now you all know that America
is at the greatest crossroads that
this nation has ever faced. Your
history books might have talked

ACOLUMN

Celebrate the season by
increasing computer security

Tiemoko Ballo
For The Pitt News

When you think of October, you
probably think of the colder au-
tumn weather or deciding what
to wear on Halloween. You prob-
ably don’t think of beeﬁng up your
computer’s security settings. Since
2004, October has been National
Cyber Security Awareness Month,
a time to become more educated
about cyber threats and evaluate
security practices. Given last se-
mester’s use of Mixmaster soft-

' ware to email bomb threats and

this semester’s threatened attacks
on two University sites by hacktiv-'
ist group Team Ghostshell, cyber
security is a Very real concern for
Pitt and for every one of its stu-

dents.

The University of Pittsburgh
has enterprise-level systems and
policies in place to protect its net-
works and keep your personal in-
formation safe, but you also have a
responsibility to secure your own
computer, and now is a great time
to look into it. The following ﬁve
measures are absolutely essential
to keeping your ﬁles, your identity
and your system out of the hands
of hackers and cyber terrorists.

1. Install one anti-virus
program. A surprisingly large
number of students do not have
any sort of anti-virus software
installed or neglect to obtain one
after their free trials are over.
Mac users in particular tend to be

guilty of this, tinder the assump- ’
tion that Macs are highly resilient 7

or completely immune to viruses
by default. Every computer con-
nected to the Internet absolutely
must have anti-virus software
installed in order to detect and
remove threats. That doesn’t mean
you have to shell out beer money:
All Pitt students can download Sy-
mantec Endpoint Protection di-
rectly from software.pitt.edu. The
program is free for the lifetime
of the computer and available for
both Macs and PCs. Other free and
highly rated alternatives include
Microsoft Security Essentials,
AVG Free and Avast. But be sure
that you have only one antivirus
application installed; having mul-
tiple antivirus programs running
simultaneously often causes them

sas or even that time the states of Ohio and
Michigan literally went to war, but those
were all mincemeat compared to the greatest
issues of our time. You see, if we don’t get it
right this time, there won’t be a next time.
It will be too late to salvage the hopes that
this beautiful country once had.

We are one country. We are the best coun-
try. Having said that, half of this country
is nuts. They want to take away all of your
freedoms and steal your jobs. If we don’t
win, the world will go to chaos without any
hope of a future.

I also want to address some inaccuracies
of the other campaign. They are running this
advertisement that says our candidate isn’t
good with animals. What our man actually

October 28, 2012 I The Pitt News I vvvwv.pittnevvs.eom

said was that he didn’t like being around ani-
mals. He’s perfectly ﬁne with them, and they
all love him. This is a totally misconstrued
media bias because my candidate always has
to be wrong intheir eyes. V
Over the next few months, you will have
a lot of promises made to you. Let me make
this clear: There is only one promise that
you have to listen to. If you vote for the guy

on the other ticket, everything that you hold .

dear will die. If you’re okay with that then,
yes, you should vote for him. I don’t know
about you, but I’m not willing to leave my
family out there like that.

to interfere with each other’s operations.

2. Put effort into multiple strong
passwords. Your simple passwords might
be easy for you to remember, but they are
also easy for brute force software to crack.
Good passwords are long — eight or more
characters —— and contain uncommon let-
ters, punctuation, symbols and numbers.
Never use words that can be found in a dic-
tionary, and don’t use the same password
for multiple sites you access. Change your
important passwords regularly, especially
those related to banking. A little variety
and complexity can go a long way. If you
have trouble remembering your passwords,
don’t write them down or keep them in a
Word document. Instead, use an encrypted
password management software such as
KeePass (also available for download from
the Pitt software page).

3. Always keep everything updated.
Windows, Mac and Linux machines are set
by default to check for the latest operating
system updates and prompt you to down-
load and install them. Do not blow these off
as bothersome system pop—ups. Updates
don’t just ﬁx minor bugs; they patch major
security vulnerabilities that hackers will
try to exploit. An old version is an exposed
version. This applies for all applications
installed on your computer, and it’s particu-
larly important to keep web browsers up-to-
date. You can run update checks yourself,
as well, and should do so regularly.

4. Use only trusted applications and
sites. Even with the previous measures,
it’s absolutely crucial to visit only repu-

. ftable websites  in§t;i1m1iy7 programs I

you trust. Common ways college students
break this rule include watching movies or
TV online from free sites, pirating with tor-
rents and clicking links in phishing emails.
Sites that host free movies or shows are
often created to attract mass traffic so that
they can bring in ad revenue while distribut-
ing malware, and many of the deceptively
placed play buttons on such sites actually
download and install malicious programs.
Stick with trusted services such_'asHulu or
Netﬂix. Piracy through torrent clients is
particularly dangerous, as it connects you
to hundreds of other random computers
simultaneously, some of which could be
distributing malware. Torrents themselves
can include any ﬁles the maker chooses to
bundle, including Trojan viruses. Emails
that appear to be from a legitimate business
but ask you to visit another site and enter
personal information are often identity
theft scams. Carefully review all messages
before you click on any links, only open
attachments from sources you trust, and
don’t ever send out Social Security or credit
card information by email.

5. Back up all of your data regularly.
Be prepared for the worst—case scenario.
Many viruses will render your computer

inoperable or erase important files. The

majority of external hard drives come with
software that allows you to make a complete
backup of your entire computer, including
most settings, and later restore it to your
computer from the drive. You should also
consider backing up key documents such
as your resume and important assignments
using a cloud service such as DropBox, Sug-
arSync or Google Drive. I

Red Oak patrons enjoy morning brunch in a relaxing atmosphere. Kenny Ong |Visual Editor

Amanda Ford
For The Pitt News

It starts every morninglwith the
ﬁrst buzz of the alarm. Maybe it’s
the gentle hum of a lightly vibrating
phone or the commanding ting of

ananalog clock or the calming lull‘

of a song from an iHome gradually
going from soft to loud to unbear-
able.

But without fail — sometimes
within seconds of shutting your
eyes to wait for the auspicious mo-
ments leading up to unconscious-
ness — the plan to steal extra sleep
is foiled. ' ‘ .

Brunch — the culinary fusion
of breakfast and lunch —— is a nice
meal with which to welcome the
ease of a weekend, away from the
buzzing alarm of each weekday,
and in Pittsburgh, there is a host
of restaurants that residents can
frequent for a midday food fest.

ly have time for or access to brunch.
During the ﬁve-day school week,
the command of the alarm signals a
busy day without time to relax in a
local restaurant. The portmanteau
of breakfast and lunch rewards the
laziness of sleeping in and nurtures

'the'hunger that results from hi-

bernation. It simply allows what
wouldn’t and couldn’t occur with

a 10 a.m. class looming overhead. V

Zenith

Zenith, a vegan and vegetarian
restaurant combined with an an-

tique and thrift store in the South

Side, embraces the idea of chaos
and uses its scattered and eclectic
environment to entice its typically
college—aged patrons.

Rob Trakoﬂer, who works at Ze-
nith, said the “charm of the place
is all the different bric-a-brac and
knick-knacks and antiques and bi-
zarre stuff that we have  and our

customers [that] are college—aged
are naturally attracted to that kind
of stu .”

The off—the-beaten-path art,
sculptures, worn and old-fashioned
clothing and battered record play-
ers strewn around the antique and.
thrift store that serves as the res-
taurant’s waiting room — a sort of
conjoined. twin to the small kitch-
en, separated by two unimpressive
doors — parallel the deliberately
“carefree” attitude of Zenith.

Amy Callusen, a customer of
the restaurant and an artist, de-
scribed Zenith’s environment as
“weird” and “artsy” and, by exten-
sion, “inspirationa ,” stating that
when brainstorming for her “artsy-
science” project, she decided to
bypass a “sterile, Panera-Bread-like
environment” for one where she
could talk to some eccentric and
creative people. ‘

Sunday brunch, the restaurant’s
most popular meal, was 7‘originally

about getting rid of leftover food,”
Trakoﬂer said. But it has now trans-
formed, and “we take a different
approach, we make stuff for it,”
providing a reminder that embrac-
ing individual ﬁitility and unavoid-

. able confusion can help people

learn to manipulate it in order to
generate art, comfort and food.

Zenith serves french toast and
pancakes, as well as stews and more
lunch-based foods.

“If you’re vegetarian, you should
try Zenith, because they’re vegetar-
ian and amazing,” Amanda Leon-
hard said about why she visited
the restaurant, words that she said
seem to also be the driving factor
of Zenith as an entity.

However, Zenith still attracts
people of the carnivorous demo-
graphic. Cameron Parkin and
Morgan Suity, neither of whom are
vegetarians, come for the buffet,
which a Zenith employee said has
a “wide variety.” The entrees even

“change weekly,” he said.

Zenith began changing its menu
weekly in order to attract people
beyond the vegetarian sub-division
and also to satisfy vegetarians who
have few other options.

“When we started that, there
were only like two other restau-
rants in the city that were vegan,
so, with that in mind, we wanted to
keep a variety so people would have
options every week, something dif-
ferent,” Trakoﬂer said.

Red Oak Cafe

David Gancy, co-owner of the
Red Oak Cafe, believes that eating
a certain way is more than a mat-
ter of taste.

“Healthy [eating] is more than a
trend; it is a way of life,” Gancy said.
This idea drives his Oakland res-
taurant, one that revolves around

VIDEO GAME REVIEW

Game evolves from predecessor, “XCOM” action creates classic

Thomas Visco
For The Pitt News

“XCOM: Enemy Unknown”
Designer: Firaxis Games
Publisher: 2K Games
Rating: A-

Pros: Accessible, engaging turn—based ac-
tion. Open-ended gameplay allows for limit-
less play time.

Cons: This game is extremely difficult —
newcomers to strategy games, be warned.
Camera angles can be unwieldy at times.

A good video game makes your heart
race. Graphics, sound and atmosphere all
play a role in the excitement. But truly great
games don’t excite you in a superﬁcial way.
Instead, they worry you, making you fret
every decision in the game.

And no contemporary game makes you
reconsider every decision like “XCOM: En-
emy Unknown,” a new release developed by
Firaxis Games.

Firaxis’ new game builds off the success
of its spiritual predecessor, “UFO: Enemy
Unknown,” which was developed by Mi-
croProse and released in 1994. “UFO” is a
classic in the turn-based strategy genre — a
game that relies on a turn system for players
to make their moves around the game world.

Today, “UFO” is universally regarded as
one of the top 10 games of all time. One of
the founding games of its genre, “UFO” suc-
ceeded as a turn—based tactics game because
of its keen sense of risk and reward. This
equation of risk and reward revolves around
time units, a limited resource players use to
move their squad around the game. Once a
player runs out of time units, no more ac-
tions can be taken in the turn, and the squad
is at the mercy of the opponent until the end
of the turn. How many time units to save or
spend — how much risk to take — is the

central point of this game.

Like its predecessor, “XCOM: Enemy Un-
known” capitalizes on this basic equation.
“XCOM” centers its plot on a ﬁctional alien
invasion in the not—so—distant future. The
player is cast as a nameless, faceless com-
mander of a special operations group intent
on defending Earth from extraterrestrial
invaders. This group receives its funding
from a council of 16 countries.

The game is separatedsinto two parts —
base management and missions. At the start
of the game, the council of countries gives
the player a basic base to manage. It is the
player’s job to deal with alien encounters
in such a way that the panic level in each
of these countries does not pass a certain
threshold. Failure to do so triggers panick-
ing countries to withdraw funding. Panic
level is just one of a host of issues to micro-
manage at the base.

While this backdrop isn’t especially
compelling, players have never ﬂocked to

“XCOM: Enemy Unknown” gives gamer a nel online experience. CT (is A

the turn-based tactics genre for the stories.
What matters is the gameplay. Base manage-
ment is not the selling point of this game,
but the pleasant user interface and straight-
forward objectives it provides ensures that
players’ main focus can be their missions.
Accordingly, the fun of “XCOM” takes
place out on missions, not at the base. These
missions operate on the turn system, the
core game mechanic in “XCOM.” Each turn,
you have the opportunity to move your squad
aroundxthe map, ﬁre their weapons at op-
ponents, or use items to aid your squad.
What follows is a series of difﬁcult deci-
sions about which of these actions to take.
Placing your team around the map foolishly
will lead to a quick and deadly ﬁnale for
your “XCOM” experience. But taking risks
with your squad — say, exposing them to
an opponent’s line of sight — may lead to
a greater reward, such as luring the enemy
into a trap. N o matter what, after your turn
is complete the computer opponent’s turn

unfolds without any opportunity for you
to rectify mistakes, so the game forces you
to think deliberately about every decision.

Ad think you will. “XCOM” is nothing
short of excruciatingly difficult, and the
challenge forces players to learn constantly
from past mistakes. While frustrating at
times — particularly when your whole squad
is wiped out due to a single error — the
game is fair. Although you may lose often,
it is always evident where your mistake was
and how to ﬁx it in later missions.

The turn—based tactical goodness of
“XCOM” is a delightful reimagining of the
classic “UFO.” The graphics and sound are
stellar for a game in this genre, capturing the
sci-ﬁ setting of the game while not being too
unbelievable. While it might be frustrating
at times, the game keeps you coming back
for its addictive risk-reward system. Overall,
“XCOM” is an action-heavy jaunt through
turn-based tactics and a deﬁnitive classic
of the genre. H

Pitt splits pair of crucial conference matchups at home

Torie Wytiaz
Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt volleyball team rode a season-high
hitting percentage to a signiﬁcant Big East
match victory last weekend, sweeping St.
John’s (17-7, 4-4 Big East).

The Panthers (13-11, 4-6 Big East) con-
nected on 49 of 101 attempts and produced
their fewest number of hitting errors this
season, 12, to defeat the Red Storm at the
Fitzgerald Field House, 3-0.

For head coach Toby Rens, the match
offered a chance to see his team’s potential.

“The attitude and effort of the entire
match was a good indication of what this
group is about and what they are capable

of doing,” Rens said. “We had exceptional .

focus from start to ﬁnish.”

Despite a season-best performance in
that match, the Panthers were unable to
carry the momentum to Sunday and fell
to conference opponent Connecticut, 3-1.

Pitt 3, St.]ohn’s 0

The Panthers set the tone for the match
in the first set as they held the lead from
start to ﬁnish and earned a 25-21 victory.
Senior Jasmine Dittrich led the way on
offense with her six kills in the set, and
on defense, the Panthers collected four
blocks.

In the second set, the score ﬂuctuated
and saw eight ties and ﬁve lead changes,
but the Panthers took a 12-8 lead that they

never relinquished. While the Red Storm-

came within two points down the stretch,
a kill by Dittrich secured the 2-0 set ad-
vantage with another 25-21 win.

The third and ﬁnal set was level at 10-
10 before the Panthers surged ahead on a
10-1 scoring run comprised of six kills, a
serving ace and three Red Storm hitting
errors. The Panthers ended the match with
a dominant 25-14 set victory to complete
the sweep.

Sophomore outside hitterjessica Wynn
acknowledged that the team’s success came
from focused preparation.

“We came off a really good week in prac-
tice,” Wynn said after the match. “We just

, tried to carry that over into the match.”

Wynn led the team with her 12 kills in
the match, while Dittrich contributed 11.
Setters Lindsey Zitzke andjennajacobson
contributed a combined total of 39 assists,
withjacobson recording a career—high 19.

Rens expressed his pleasure with the
efforts of both of his setters and their abil-
ity to run the offense.

“Both of our setters did a great job ex-
ecuting our game plan,” Rens said. “I was
pleased with the set distribution, and we
did a good job getting St. John’s out-of-
system.”

A GRAIN OF SAUL

Houston only dominant team in lackluster AFC this season“

Isaac Saul
Senior Staff Writer

The National Football League has experi-
enced a shift in power this season.

For much of the last decade, the Ameri-
can Football Conference has dominated
the National Football Conference. But this
season the AFC has struggled, allowing the
NFC to command the league with several
teams appearing to be Super Bowl worthy.

After looking through the NFC’s divi-
sions last week, let’s take a ride through the
four divisions that make up the traditionally
tough, but recently mediocre, AFC:

AFC East

As always, the New England Patriots
are in control of the AFC East early in the
season. A

Quarterback Tom Brady and the Patriots
have suffered a couple of uncharacteristic

losses, but with a 4-3 record after construct-
ing a come-from-behind victory over the
Jets on Sunday, New England proved it still
knows how to win. .

Quietly biting at New England’s heels are
the Miami Dolphins, who have managed to
stay at .500 this season but haven’t seen
any good teams yet. With the Jets, Colts,
Seahawks and Patriots coming up in the next
six weeks of their schedule, the Dolphins
are going to have to pick up a few signature
wins to stay in the race.

In New York, thejets and Buffalo seem to
be lacking the talent to get it done.

The Tim Tebow experiment could be on
the horizon for an inconsistent Jets team
that has struggled with poor quarterback
play and an average defense. If thejets and
Bills don’t turn it around soon, they could
ﬁnd themselves eliminated from the playoff
race in the near future.

AFC North

The North seems to be a strong division
again this year.

The parity is there, but there is no clear-
cut dominant force among the Ravens (5-2),
Steelers (3-3) and Cincinnati (3-4).

Pittsburgh picked up a big win Sunday
night when it knocked off the Bengals, but
the Steelers still trail the Ravens by two
games. However, Baltimore is banged up,
and in its first game without linebacker Ray
Lewis, the team was obliterated by Houston.

For Baltimore, success will require run-
ning back Ray Rice to continue to domi-
nate and to get more carries than he did
last week. But it’s going to be all about how
quarterbackjoe Flacco performs in the play-
offs, assuming the Ravens get there.

AFC South

This year, the AFC South is one of the

most compelling divisions in the league.

Houston was an early Super Bowl favor-
ite, and the Texans have gotten off to a good
start. At 6-1, their only loss is to a Pack-

ers team that was desperate for a win, and 

they have three big in—conference victories
over thejets, Broncos and Baltimore. If this
team can stay healthy, they’ve got as good a
chance as anyone to make it to the playoffs.

Behind Houston in the standings are
the Andrew Luck-led Colts, who at 3-3 are
trying to get back to their winning ways. 4
Luck, has proved he can get it done at the
end of a game, especially after out-dueling
Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers in
the fourth quarter a couple weeks back. But
aside from the Packers, the Colts don’t have
any impressive wins and narrowly escaped "
losing to a terrible Cleveland Browns team
last weekend.

With Luck playing well, this team always
has a shot.
AFC West

The results of this division are going
to come down to the last few weeks of the
season.

Last week, Denver got a look at why Pey-
ton Manning is the right choice for any team
at quarterback as he dominated the second
half against the Chargers and completed one
of the biggest comebacks in NFL history.
Returning from injury, Manning has thrown
14 touchdowns — good enough for fourth
in the league — and his 105.3 quarterback

The Houston Texans proved their conference dominance with an impressive home win

   
   

rating is the second—best in the rankings.
The aforementioned Chargers are still in
the competition. They’ve lost two straight
games, but San Diego proved it can score
with talented quarterback Philip Rivers,
who constantly seems just on the brink of
greatness. If San Diego gets hot, this could
be the year he breaks through to an AFC
Championship game or Super Bowl.
Behind both these teams are the Oakland
Raiders, who, despite being 2-4, have proven
they have some talent and are still not out of
the running. With an easy upcoming sched-
ule, the Raiders could pull off a winning
season if they can improve their running
game — currently 31st in the NFL — to
match their solid passing attack. I

VOLLEYBALL

Fitzgerald Field House, and the Huskies
defeated the Panthers in a tightly contested
3-1 match with set scores of 25-21, 25-27,
26-24 and 25-21.

In the ﬁrst set, Connecticut maintained
the lead from the 3-3 mark and out—hit the
Panthers 17-12. The Panthers managed to
come within one at the 22-21 point, but
a kill and a block by UConn ended their
comeback attempt.

Set two was just as evenly matched, as
both teams battled to a 25-25 tie. A block
by Zitzke and a kill by sophomore Kate
Yeazel gave the Panthers the set victory
and tied -the match at 1-1.

However, the Panthers could not close
out the third set. Two Pitt errors allowed
the Huskies their ﬁnal two points in the
26-24 set win.

The fourth set secured the overall match

victory for Connecticut, as the Huskies
ended the set with a 4-0 run from the 21-
21 mark.

According to Dittrich, the Panthers
lacked the consistency needed to earn the
match victory.

“We showed a lot. of energy at times,
especially when our backs were against
the wall,” Dittrich said. “Unfortunately,
it was too late in the match to come back
and win.”

Fellow senior outside hitter Alexa
Campbell agreed, noting that the Pan-
thers had an opportunity to close out the
contest.

“We learned that ﬁnishing is important,
and there is no time to let up,” Campbell
said. “We needed to continue pushing to
finish all 25 points.” "

Pitt will return to action when the Pan-
thers travel to face conference opponents

matches on Friday, Oct. 26, and Sunday,
