Natalie Petesch, 1974 Iowa School_

along‘ Squirrel Hill avenues, her
latest sealed and packaged manu-
script in hand ready to be whizzed
to New York quite like one of her
most striking characters ﬂies in and

_ Social paradoxes, timelessness,

 ‘First Death There is No Other.

A deceptive straightforward man-
ner, along with sharp insight to the
subtler_ aspects of our vast and
gloriﬁed oppressions on this earth,
reveal the plight of the characters
in this short story collection--
their cruelty, their evil charm or
pathetic ignorance, insanity, or

';f\'l;-t,g.r‘netimes bungling ineptitude.

“Each character must fulﬁll his or

resolving or ‘failing to resolve,
private dilemmas, which by the
imagination of the reader are
enlarged and enriched into exis-
tencial choices -for the survival of
humankind.”

Jazz Making Home in Pgh.ip

' BY B. LAMBL

They say’ Pittsburgh is not a jazz ‘

town. Not because it doesn’t have
the musicians. It does, but they all
have to leave to make it big. The
trouble with Pittsburgh is the
audience. There is none. And
without the audience there’s no
incentive to set up clubs that will
bring the musicians and the crowd
together.

But since 1956, Bobby Davis has
been booking jazz at the Encore.
Harold Betters is Davis’s main
man, but Davis is constantly
bringing in nationals or giving
newcomers a chance. In 1961, he
opened the downtown Encore and
between the two clubs, he gives
jazz a pretty fair spin.

For a club with a slick reputation,

things can get pretty funky on.

Walnut Street. Last Friday was
one of those nights.
The show started at 9:30 and the

trio ran everything from sambas to ‘

Black rock trying to reach the
crowd. But» for a while nothing
happened. The crowd turned over
a couple of times. Luther de
Jarnette hung his_.head over the
chords he picked, while blind Keith
Stabler stared straight into the
light over the organ. '

Around 11:30 pm a new crowd had
settled in. Mostly Oakland and
Shadyside people‘. They looked like
they were going to stay awhile and

Then it clicked.

Keith, who’d been I skittering

He was the mainstay of the group.
The organ he played had been
picked up from an old lady “who
used to play church music on it.”
But he made it carry the missing
bass line as well as the improvisa-
tion and the harmony. By the end
of this piece he ‘was straddling the

Hazo, directorof the Poetry Forum,
when it was established through a
grant from . the A. W. Mellon
Educational and Charitable Trust
in 1966.
According to Hazo, the Forum fills
[a need. “Poetry is an oral art--that
is, it is meant to be heard. You
don’t get that in newspapers.”

Of course, some poets read better
than others. “Stanley Burnshaw, a
native-born Pittsburgher and poet,
made the point once that poets
attempt simply to get their mean-
ings on paper. The saying of what
";.‘~ey’ve put on paper requires a

"different kind of ability."

Hazo considers, “Anthony Hecht

is a superbreader. Another fine
ireader is Stanley Kunitz. William
Jay Smith, Richard Wilbur, and
Adrienne Rich read well.”

SAUEL HAZO

Since '66, the Forum has ex-
panded its ﬁeld beyond the sim-
plicity of the poetry reading.

“The definition of poetry as verse
is really at most about two hundred
years old. Fundamentally, it’s not
true." Hazo explained that poetry
is anything that comes from the
imagination, art, music, drama. “I
have not gone to the extent of
sponsoring appearances here by
architects, although I could, in

_ Volunteers read poems in several

schools in both the public and
parochial school systems.

Several years ago the state of Ohio
went bankrupt. Because of it, the
Forum acquired Mundus Artium, a
semi-annual journal of poetry and
arts, now being distributed in 27
countries. ’

“The state universities were told
to pare their budgets. The ﬁrst
things to go when 'you have a
financial stringency of that kind is
the so-called ‘cultural ornamenta-
tion." Hazo explained, g‘,‘/Football

Ohal Ienges the Audience

The Pittsburgh Film-Makers,

occupies a second story ofﬁce and it
appears they have until sundown to
get out of town. Half completed
ceilings, cartons ﬁlled with books
and magazines all point to that
conclusion. Fortunately for the city,
they are here to stay. ' -
“We’re renovating the place,”
executive director Robert Haller
explains appologetically. “The
Film-Makers will have the only
non-commercial photo gallery in

the city. And our ﬁlm library will be ‘

quite extensive.” _
But galleries and libraries aren’t_
the Film-Makers main attraction.

People in the area can’t'afford the ' ‘

expense of _film making. ‘TWe  

provide the equipment to cut
personal costs,”~ Haller said.
“Making a film can cost as much as
$3000.” .
Pittsburgh Film-Makers not only

work to make their own ﬁlms, but I

also study techniques and‘ theory.
Haller expressed distress over the
“Hollywood” type ﬁlms. “They

slip into boring formulas that don’t ’

challenge the audience. Those
movies demand nothing of you.”
But with an “artsy” attitude, the
masses often scream, “Elitist!”
“Oh no,” Hallermcontests. “It’s

not an elitist approach we7re after. ,

' the hands of Joseph Papp.

 

Chomping on his cigar that only

i Mitzi I. Newhouse managed to

extinguish, he spoke not pompous-
ly, but with commanding presence.

 Referring to Broadway with dis-
 dain, Papp spoke of the writer with
.  lovjn-g warmth.

‘ “As far as Broadway is con-

’ ' » _ce_rned, there are no serious writers
 , -- American writers -- on Broadway

today. Most of_ the Broadway
producers either bring in plays
from England or they originate

’ ' ' musicals. I can think of very few

new plays, except the Albee play
(seasifape) which is now being
rehearsed to go onto Broadway;

" foutside of that, nothing.”

With a darting glance he quickly

‘reconsidered. Now; he pondered

his thoughts. “Well, there are

 

 

some producers working primarily
with the writer -- Cafe Le Mama is
interested in working with new
writers...and, I'm trying to think of
others. Not many.”

Papp patented the key to success.

Simple and straight. For it is just
this play that may be important to
the development of the playwright.

These are the hands of Joseph Papp.

He realizes his limitations as an
artistic talent. He is not a
playwright, nor does he profess to
be. “That’s an art in itself,” Papp
explains. I

In his New York Shakespeare
Festival, the playwright commands
the lead. Papp has often said he
backs the playwright rather than

the theater.” Papp explains. “It
starts with the play, and I’m
interested because these are
original thoughts, original theatre.
He makes possible jobs for
directors and actors. Without a
writer, you don’t have theatre.

Unless you want to do dead writers,

but there are still plenty of modern

ones.”

This is Papp’s second shot at
filling the Lincoln Center theatres
with new writers’ works. In his
statement of play policy, “New
Plays for Old,” printed in The New
York Times on July 4, 1973 he
concluded:

New writers, men and women
with special sensibilities [victims of
our times], are responding with
special insights, having the cour-
age to probe deeply within
themselves, to bear the pain of this
search, so that we can understand
ourselves in these times. No other
tool of civilization can provide the
kind of -perception that the writer
brings to bear on the crisis in its in
our society. The living playwright
therefore is a resource we must

treasure, nourish and produce. He,

speaks to us and for us.”

Papp also speaks to us. He speaks
in an atmosphere ﬁlled with
creativity and expansion, commo-
tion and activity. From a well-lit,
plant-ﬁlled CMU drama depart-
ment office, he felt at home. The
works of Shakespeare, Albee and
countless others towered above.

“I start with plays I like. The
ultimate choice depends -on a
combination of certain people. A
very good director and an
interesting actor may hasten! the
choice. Look, "you see there’s the
notion that there’s a foolproof way
-- there isn't any. You’re operating.
from total instinct, and taste, and
judgment which is fallible.”' ~

 

   

You can do it, too. So far over 550,000 other people have done it. People who
have "different jobs, different I05, different interests, different educations have
completed the course. Our graduates are people from all walks of life. These

BY BILL HADUCK

A big gold Eldorado burned its
way up a cindered road to a tall
white apartment building sitting on
a hill behind downtown Pittsburgh.

The tailpipes were throwing out

./ ‘fare steam than exhaust because

it was a very cold morning and the
man behind the wheel was all
bundled up in a costly looking
fur-collared coat and a ‘scarf and
leather gloves. He brought the car
to a quick stop where a red carpet
stretched from the door of
Washington Plaza Apartments to
the curb. In the lobby, the house
electrician was searching his tool
box for some tape when he looked
out the big glass doors and asked
the doorman, “Who’s that?” The
doorman looked at him, not too
surprised. It was a good ﬁfty feet
to the curb. The electrician just
didn’t recognize him.

man. It was a reasonable answer to
a reasonable question. He put one
foot forward and leaned against the
wall. But then the electrician
asked,

“Who?”

Walt Harper, you dodo.
what the doorman’s face said, but
he himself didn’t because he had to
open the door. It was true. This
guy was from Pittsburgh and he
didn’t know who Walt Harper is.

resident pro laughs as he knocks
stray balls off the court. He’s
young and has a German accent
which echoes strangely off the
smooth walls of the balloon’s
inside.

“Aah, I’ll show ya,” Walt replies.

Peeling his sweat pants down to
the tennis shorts beneath, he whips
a few balls into a shopping cart on
the sidelines, basketball style. His
brown legs are rippled with-muscle

behind his piano on stage.

“Okay, let’s loosen up a bit.” He
begins’whacking balls across the

his whole face tied into one big knot‘
of “I’m gonna get that ball,” it’s
hard to imagine him under his
circle of lights at the Attic giving
the audience a low, almost under
his breath “Thank you, ladies and
gentlemen.”

The action goes on. Toonk Toonk,
Toonk,...The ball sails onto Walt’s
half of the court, and as if his
raquet had no strings, he misses.

“Goddamn!” he screams, push-
ing his raspy voice about as far as it
will go. The rich upstairs ladies on
the adjacent court look over,
expecting to see a murder or
something, but Walt just turns and
chases the ball. It gets lost among
all the other balls laying in the out
of bounds, but Walt ﬁnds the same
one and smacks it back across the
net. He hates to screw up at
tennis. Kaufman catches it.

“Listen Walt,” he says with just
enough authority to let him know
who’s the pro, “Here’s what you’re
doing wrong. You’ve got to spin
right after your return and get

lot of his groups.. That leaves his
open, he says, to a lot of good
music. Naturally, a lot of bad
music has also passed through the
Encore. You take your chances.
But the combination of skilled
musicians and an open audience
gives spontaneous music. And that
is sometimes known as jazz.

The scene at the downtown
Encore was a lot different. ‘ There
the crowd was coats and ties.

Natty Harold Betters introduced
the act. '

“lxwant you all to meet a friend of
mine from Squirrel Hill. Now this
friend of mine’s in love with a
married woman.”

A little man bounces up from the
bar and bends the mike to the
audience. .

“Have you ever had the blues?
The blues, like the blahs, I mean
the blues...”

The audience is cold.

“Like all I want to know is, have
you ever had the blues?" He really
means it. Finally someone says:

Audio-Visual Services will present
Orson Wells’ famous classic,
Citizen Kane in Room 324 of the
Cathedral of Learning on Thurs-
day, February 6 at 8:00 pm. The
screening is free and open to the
public.

“Once in a while.”

“Oh yeah, oncein a while,” he
picks up the line and starts singing.

And Betters is right behind him,
wheeling his trombone around.

He is a showman. ’His act is
polished from the first smile to the
last glint of setting trombone. The
music is big, the style flashy. And
after all these years in Pittsburgh,
he still packs a crowd.

As Bobby Davis sees it, jazz has
changed over the past nine years.
It’s come down from the Hill into
Oakland and Shadyside. And
people have begun turning away
from hard rock into jazz. But with
its popularization it’s sacriﬁced
some of the esoteric charm. As
Bobby put it, “People don’t want to
be taken out somewhere in the
middle of a song and left there. A

player can’t sleep on the horn‘
_, anymore.

People want to know
where they started from and where
they’re going. The guys can only
take them so far. ..then they have to
bring them right back.” Davis has
managed to work both types of jazz
into his place.

In a week, Harold Betters will be

in Shadyside, and in a month or so,
Nathan Davis. Downtown will
feature Anita O’Day and then
Teddy Wilson, both classic jazz
performers from the 40’s-50's
period. There is usually no cover
and drinks run from $1 to 1.50.

Must Be 21

BY HARRIS LEVY '

Most theatres in Oakland are now
empty. But while audiences are at
home, Oakland’s theater groups
are busy preparing a full series of
shows. Oakland's upcoming
theatre activities are described
below:

STUDIO THEATRE

According to Studio Theatre
President Marily McWilliams, the
Studio is designed to “give
directors with relatively little
experience a chance to try out their
ability. It gives them a chance to

use the space in an innovative .

way."

The directors are always students,
McWilliams said, and the Studio is
funded by Student Government.

About ﬁfteen productions are
presented each calendar year, she
said. “A lot of them are original
productions written by students or
plays that have never been
published.’ ’ -

“The trend is toward more
original shows,” McWilliams ad-
ded.

The next Studio Theatre presen-
tation will be the Music Show, on
February 14 and 15. Women at
Play will be presented on March
13, 14, and 15 with The President
and Purgatory playing together on
March 26, 27, 28, and 29.

On April 4 and 5 German Reader’s
Theatre will be performed and

‘Everyman will ﬁnish the season. on ,
April 10, 11, 12, and 17, 18, 19.

The Studio Theatre drew praise
from student directors David Lear,
Toby Beckwith and Jeff Chapman.

“,It’s awfully. ﬂexible,” Beckwith ,

said.

“You can use the whole space,”
Lear remarked.

“It’s a free space,” Beckwith
said. “There’s no pressure on you
other than what you put on
yourself."

Lear lauded the Studio because
directors can try new ideas. “The
audience can participate -- you can
bring the audience into what you're
doing. The physical structure is
ﬂexible enough for any kind of
design.”

According to the students, the
Studio is like a company developing
ideas from what they’ve learned.
“While you’re directing, you feel
as if everybody’s on your side,”
Chapman said.

“We learn from each other,"’ he
added. -

According to Lear, the Studio idea
will explore other areas. “The idea
is to go outside and work on the
concrete stage in front of Carnegie
Library. Maybe a puppet show in
the spring.”

“In past years,” Chapman said,
“improvisational shows have been
more popular. Through our clown
class, we've learned about more
free forms.” '~

The Studio Theatre, whose ﬁrst
season was 1969-1970 according to
Theatre division coordinator Dr.
Attilio Favorini, was designed by
faculty member Ned Bowman. “It
was the child of his mind,” Lear
said. ’

SOUTH OAKLAND ARTS O
I COUNCIL

“The South Oakland Arts Council
is more of an experimental

. theatre,” according to Kathy Ken-

nedy.

Local Theatre Alive and Well

“We try to do shows that haven’t
been done in a long time or original
plays.” The ‘Arts Council’s next
production, George S. Kaufman
and Marc Connelly’s Beggar on
Horseback, a “surrealistic comedy
from the l930’s is scheduled for
April. ..

Beggar on Horseback concerns a
conflict between the arts and the
business world. ,

“We’re like a semi-professional
community theatre. The people
involved are more interested in
theatre than in just meeting
people." This year the Arts
Council has presented’ Loves and
Lovers and The Sty of The Blind
Pig at the Paul Younger Commun-

‘ ity center located on the Boulevard
. of the Allies.

The South Oakland Arts Council is
funded by the Model Cities pro-
gram, Kennedy said. “We try to =

 

get people in the Model Cities;-§\,_

neighborhood involved. They like‘

musicals like Inner City. A- lot of
them have never seen a live theatre
performance before. We get a lot
of response from students.”
General interest ﬁlms are also
shown by the Arts council at the .
Paul Younger Community Center.
“We also had a class in mime and
we take kids to the Playhouse,”

‘Kennedy said as she noted other

Arts Council Activities. The ‘Model

‘Cities Grant runs until April but

Kennedy said that she was hopeful
that the Arts Council wouldn’t die
as she speculated on its future.

PITTSBURGH LABORATORY
THEATRE 4

“We’re an experimental theatre.
We’re as interested in the process
of creation of the theatrical event as
in the ﬁnal performance,” said,Bill
Royston of the Pittsburgh Labor-
atory Theatre.

The Lab, which this season lfasgf

presented Arrabal’s Orison: Panic
Ceremony and Prologue, an an-
thology, performs most of their
work in a renovated building at
Fifth and Craft. “A lot of our work

, is stimulated by our environment,”

Royston said.

The Labyrinth by Fernando Arra-
bal is the Lab's next production. It
will be performed on Fridays and

19th.

  Foreign Films

Saturday from March 14th to ,, 

‘Pittsburgh's Fifth Annual Inter-  

i Delightful Odds n’

(Continued from Pay? 4)

Royston elaborated the Lab's
philosophy. “A lot of our time is
spent with different theories and
workingwith them in the labora-
tory situation. We’re constantly

~=~’-/F‘:,'2,luating ideas from ourselves

2

and others.”
The cast of Prologue recently
performed their work at the Uni-
' tarian church at Fifth and Ells-
worth. ' Pitt’s English department
was responsible for it. “We did
prologue around the people. When
Buffalo got up at the pulpit to
deliver the Beckett speech a
woman looked at her husband and
asked ‘Is this the sermon?’ They
interpreted the structure as being
the same.

“In a sense, we’ve become more -

performance oriented,” Royston
said -as he discussed the Lab’s
/-6-4} coming subscription series. This
' “simmer the Lab will present Hot
ice by Charles Ludlam and Jack
Gelber’s The Apple.
Shows for next year include
‘ Ionesco's Exit The King, Albee’s
Box/Mao/Box, Stoppard’s The
-Real Inspector Hound, Beckett’s
Endgame and The Tooth of Crime
by Sam Shepard.
Performing Dutchman on a PAT

I, bus is one of Royston’s long range

goals. “We would have the ‘special
bus pick up people at Fifth and
Craft and drop them offthere after

the play is ﬁnished.” Royston
would also like to perform Waiting
For Godot in the country.” Act one
would be performed on Friday and
then the cast and the audience
could camp out. The second‘ act
could be done the next day.”

CARLOW COLLEGE

Carlow’s productions complement
the shows performed elsewhere in
the area, according. to faculty
member James Berry. “Our policy
is somewhat limited by our circum-
stances.

‘_‘In one way, that’s rather nice.
Other places with larger halls do
bigger productions while we’re
doing Shaw, Ibsen and Strindberg.
It gives students an opportunity to
see classic plays,” Berry ex-
plained. “I don’t think Strind-
berg’s The Father, which we did
last year, was ever seen in Pitts-
burgh before.” -

“There are enough straw hat
theatres if people want to see
Shakespeare or Broadway shows.”

Gaslight, a “Victorian thriller”
will be performed on March 5-8.
"‘In terms of acting style we try to
re-create a period. For Gaslight
the actresses will have to learn how
to move and sit in hoop skirts.”

“We’re not attempting to train
actors,” Berry said. “We consider
actor training a by-product to

POINT PARK COLLEGE PRO-
DUCTIONS AT THE PITTS-
BURGH PLAYHOUSE

As You Like It will be the next
Point Park College production at
the Playhouse. According to Alan
Clarey, _Point Park faculty member
and producer, the show will be
faithfully performed in modern
dress. “Shakespeare wasn't writ-
ing a period piece,” Clarey said of

the play which will be performed

from February 28th through March
15th. V

. “The selection .of our shows is
based 90% on the educational
value for the actors. Of course,
consideration is given to the aud-
ience and the marketability of the
show but the primary concern is the
education .of the actor. Our
secondary concern is the education
of the audience.” .

Story Theatre will close’ the season
for the Playhouse, Jr. as well as the
adult program. “It’s ideally suited
to both audiences,” Clarey_ said,
referring to the production planned
for April. — y

“We like to prepare a variety of
material for the actors to tackle.”
Emphasizing the diversity of this
year’s works by authors ranging
from Shakespeare to Pirandello,
Clarey said, “we try to include at

Ends   ofﬂaklantl theatre

least one musical and one classical
play so the performers will get a
crack at many kinds of shows.”

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH
THEATRE

“There are only two activities of
the University that the general
public comes in contact with:
sports and theatre. Only one is

really in line with the University's

mission.”
“Theatre is the only place where

the general public gets a look at the —

University at work. Students do
their work and the faculty does
their job. I V I

Dr. Attilio F avorini, coordinator of
Pitt’s ‘Theatre Arts division, dis-
cussed the department’s philos-
ophy and activities.

“Last year we began the practice
of choosing mainstage shows about
a single theme. Last year it was
love, marriage and sex. This year

"we did plays of social revolt.” —

Cabaret, performed in November,

_will be followed by Michel De

Ghelderode’s Pantagleize which
opens on March 6. Look Back in
Asnger by John Osborne will follow
in May and June. V _
“Next year’s theme is the melting
pot, alien cultures in America.”
F avorini ‘elaborated the reasons for
the choice. “For the bicentennial

year, we wanted to do something‘

with an American ﬂavor.

 
  
  

"We also had to consider. what,“
kind of town Pittsburgh is. One of 1'.
the guiding philosophies" of the 1
Theatre department is"'tlia't” it’s ;,
geared to Pittsburgh. 

“Our aspirations
Broadway,” he said. V V _ A

“The best possible theatre e,_duca-"'_f  Li 3;.
tion should not be apart from the 
community but immersed in it.”".‘f~:: -.
Theatre Education should be 3 ,_
colored by humanistic ideals,”_ hell’-P" 
said. I I

Favorini mentioned the different:-.:
programs’evolved by the theatre 7
division. “There’s our children’s; 
company, the workshop out. in 
Western Pysch and the Instruc-' 
tional Performance Company which  ;  
tours classrooms.” . ' v I 

The purpose of the University" 
must also be considered. “If 
possible we try to devote our
practical and theoretical work.” '7 \

Serving the university community ".5
is also important. “Ideally, "the *
production program serves the 4-" 
community, and provides the Stu’.-‘."__,.,
dents and faculty with opportuni-- I
ties -for artistic growth.” ' .‘ -

Dr.-Gillette Elvgren of the departs, I
ment conceived the idea to produce  "
an original documentary playabout‘ _ V
some aspect of Pittsburgh. “We .' ~
settled on steel. No single facto g
has been as influential.” ‘ '1  3

“The steel industry not only:-r—
employs many people but iaffects'f;‘.*R'

Just What
Do These
Wonderful 

BY DOUG GEBHARD
“And the Lord said, ‘Let there be light...”’

And not only was there light, but sound and screaming rock’n’roll
crazies with ‘popcorn and grass, pillsssss...and trips...wow, zapp. So
now where do we go? .

To walk’ on stage, plug in a wood contraption called an electric guitar
and play on and know, yes deep down in your heart know, that any little
young girl in the audience will pull her skirt up so you can take a
peek...what power, what thrills, what fun...what insanity.

America has helped breed a special type of person who makes
millions, drives expensive and expansive cars, smokes all the dope
they wish and drives teenagers wild. We call him “Rock’n’roll Star”.

It’s been said better by others in song and story, but the image doesn’t A

seem to be disappearing from the nation. . .in fact the stardom business
is rapidly becoming, if it isn’t already, big business’ competition. Look:
you don’t need to cut your hair or even have any particular skill (as is

1 evidenced by many bands today). All you need to have is wide range

appeal. With the right promotional people we have seen that just about
any one can make it in the music ‘industry without much knowledge
about music. ‘

The classic was the Monkeys, because all they were in the beginning
were an assembling of people from a newspaper ad. The hype and
training put them into business. Alice Cooper, America’s number one
son, was schlock but made it with a little help from Frank Zappa. And
now we have the ever popular Bachman-Tumer-Overdrive. By Randy
Bachman’s own admission he runs the band like a business adventure
-- putting together the right tunes with enough commercial potential
that will make them sell. ‘

To attend a concert is more than just going to hear the music...what
an understatement. Do you realize what goes on at shows nowadays? It
may sound stupid to ask that, but there are lots of folks who haven’t
been to a show in a while because of the very things that happen there.
Lets take a look at this phenomena: , S

First off a ticket has to be purchased. So you save up enough cash, not
eating at Winky’s for a month, to hop on down to National Record Mart
’cause you heard that Fleetwood Mac’s coming into town. Tickets are
$4.00, $5.00 and $6.00. When you get there the tickets are mail order
and there is a $.25 charge for service of tickets anyway. Next week
‘you’ll have to skip the strawberry milkshake and buy a stamp. Fine.
You send in the cash and in return you receive seats in the second
balcony on the far left...what the hell, you say, I paid top price! Tough
shitl ' ~

The salesend has put the promoter and consumer so far away from -

each other it’s incredible. By doing this they don’t have to confront you
as a human being, rather you are down to that dollar sign that made
America famous. It’s the American way...who needs to see your face

 
 
  

:To Do With

and talk to you...it’s the best way to outpsyche you...diminish your
importance. Who is more important, you or the artist, to the promoter?
Bet your sweet ass it’s the artist, because he’s making the bread for the
promoter. In its own insane way it makes sense.

It makes all the sense in the world. Who told you that you were
important enough to be reconciled with? You are a nobody and don’t
forget that, because you live in the United States of America and it’s
1975 A.N. (after Nixon). If for one moment you begin to think that
anything you do or think would make a difference in this country...well

, atthat point you become real. And to be real, to feel, is unethical.

Listen:

Led Zepplin, Bob Dyland, CSN and Y, Joni Mitchell, Allman Bros.,
Beatles, Band, Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Stevie Wonder,
Weather Report. . .any of those names ring a bell? Well if not then I love
you because you have been fortunate enough to seclude yourself from
the rock’n’roll machine that has been devouring the country for the
past four ‘years. 4

It’s really been the past four years that the thing went out of
control...the star rnaker machine that ate the World...it’s a new movie
and ‘everybody, just everybody, has seen it. Haven’t you seen it

dahling? It’s utterly mahvahlous. There is one part where all the kids in
the nation spend exorbitent amounts of cash to see and hear mind
bending, ear-splitting music that drives them into a frenzy...wild
enough. to make them do just about anything including throwing vast
quantities of speed and qualudes down their gullets along with alcohol
and who knows what else.

Dr. Faustus sold his soul to Mephistopheles for eternal life. I’d sell
my soul to any promoter for an.eternal ticket to every‘ rock show that
will ever come about. But me thinks that it might be short-lived...eh,
what say? Considerthe tact that many of our gods have been killed by
their own gods. Their voices have been slowly going to hell and musical

* dimensions are expanding to the point where rock will no longer be of

any value. .

Jazz is the new kick. If they could only bottle it, it would go over much
bigger...well now if they could grind it and you could smoke it...holy
shit I can see it now...mentholated Stanley Clarke or new Kool Brian
Auger.-..outasight... -

Don’t think I’m mad...I’ve been bitten by the bug too, you see.

' Tonight I'm going to see the Led pulverize the Civic ‘Arena. But I’m
going for frreeeeeeee...wow, there ainit no way I’m paying anybody »

that much to destroy my hearing and digestive tract. I hope you've

“The mainstage productions are

Favorini also explained the mini--

festival program inaugurated this
year. “The mini-festival for
Cabaret included an art show, a
film and a seminar.”

“Given the dearth of professional
theatre, our audiences have
jumped,“ Favorini said.

best attendance in years. Cabaret
broke all records. Sixty-ﬁve hun-
dred people went to Cabaret’s 13
performances, more than the aver-
age run at the Playhouse."

Next year, there may be four

mainstage productions. In addition ’

to the steel play, which will run for
possibly 30 performances, another
of the shows may be original. “In
all likelihood, one of the plays will
be A Touch Of The Poet by Eugene
O'Neill.” ,

The budget for the ‘mainstage
productions is approximately a
third of what it was in the 1960’s.

THE PITTSBURGH 99 CENT
FLOATING THEATRE FESTIVAL

The Pittsburgh 99 Cent Floating
Theater is only in its first year. But
according to executive director Dr.
Richard Mennen, “the idea’s be-
ginning to catch on.”

“More and more people know it
exists,” he said of the program
which has presented four shows
with two more scheduled for Feb-
ruary. “I hope that people start
looking for announcements with
confidence that the festival will
present interesting and different
stuff in theatre, music, and
dance." '

“The 99 Cents has arisen from a.

need _for. performances free from
the expectations enforced by high-
priced tickets, free from the buy-
and-sell minded set” according to
the statement of principles issued
earlier this year. Theifestival is a
ﬂoating theatre because perfor-
mers will be matched with avail-
able places. Thus far, including
the two shows this month, no two
festival productions have appeared
in the same hall.

Mennen hopes to have five more
groups appear by May. “We’re

going to try to organize a summer‘

festival; say about four groups in a

month period, each here for a,

week. A’I hope to generate enough
support from‘ students and the
community.”

-The 99 Cents Theatre is now
connected with similar Eastern
groups in an informal circuit. The
groups met» in Philadelphia last
month to coordinate bookings and
expand cooperation, according to
Mennen. ' _

“The existence of a circuit will
make it more and more possible to
bring groups to Pitt,” Mennen
said.

Mennen was inspired by the
success of the Theatre Project in
Baltimore. “Phil Arnoult has been
producing free theatre in Balti-
more, running all kinds of work-
shops. If it could work in
Baltimore, it could work in Pitts-

burgh. Rather than being free, it's A

practically free.”
Mennen hopes to build a regular
audience and get a total attendance
of 1000 for each group. “We will
need our own space in the future.
He hopes to be able to subsidize
performances of local artists and
possibly present them on the same
evening with visiting groups.

 Quoting a recent issue
I The New York Times, “Even the
on‘-profit’ theater has found that
touch of star power never hurts,
specially at a time when the
“eater-going public, nursing its
iiuhflation-deflation pocketbook,
meeds very little encouragement to

the use of great talent wherever

get the rights. Tried very, very
hard.” Papp rebounds with several
other prospects.

“I have some ideas for ﬁlms. I
was going to do Boom Boom Room.
But we couldn’t get an agreement,
so it fell apart.” i

“That Championship Season is
being done.” Playboy Productions
lifted it off his hands. “If I had
known then what I know now, I
probably would not have sold it.
We would have gotten a better
production out of it.” I

But on stage, the Public Theatre
ﬂourishes with activity. Papp and
several assistants comb through
fifty or so scripts received weekly.
Once that rapport is developed
between artistic talents, it is
difficult for either to break away.

“Some of them --
(Alfred) Antoom. Soon as he left,’
he went into doing that (Neil
Simon) The Good Doctor. They
replaced him, but I have his
replacement working‘ for ; me, too.
The choreographer, Michael Ben-
net. He’s doing an original musical
with Marvin Hamlish. They"re
working on it now.-”

At this point in Papp’s career,
dream productions have vanished.
A man who occupies nine stages
(including the Zellerbach Theatre
at the University of Pennsylvania)
doesn’t have to dream. He can turn
his dreams into reality.

“I don’t have big dreams.” Papp
states demurely. “Any play Iwould
dream about, I would do. I mean,
I’d always do a Chekhov play
without hesitation. And there’s a
theater-play I've always loved. It
was Trelwany _ of the Well --
marvelous‘ theatre-play. ‘Oh, I love
old plays. But if I have to make a
decision whether to do an old play
or a new one -- if I must make that
choice -- I'll do a newplay. Because
then, I'm furthering the present
life of the theatre.” »

Broadway dead? Perhaps. But
those restless hands of Joseph

star’s name for drawing power is
not his style.

“Liv Ullmann, (who plays Nora in
Papp’s upcoming production of A
Doll’s House) is a very fine
actress...who happens to be a star.
Do you have some kind of prejudice
against stars?” he barks.

Today, “stars” don’t carry the
sole responsibility for increasing a
play’s drawing power. Playwrights.
have paved their own way to
ccstardonhas

“Neil Simon sent me a script of
his, and he's the most produced
playwright in professional theatre.
I read his play and didn't like it,
and I wrote him an analysis. He
says ‘You're right. I’m going to put
the play away. But just out of
curiosity, I don’t understaml why
you didn't produce it, because
anybody would just love to produce
my p1ay.”‘ .

Papp gently muses. “I said ‘I
didn't like it.’ And he was kind of
surprised. That would be exploita-
tion. If I did his play just because of
his reputation, I’d be doing myself
a disservice; -that ' would b'e
opportunistic...But if I did his play
because Iliked it, I wouldn’t care if
it were Simon’s play -- just asrlong
as I thought it were an excellent
play, I’d do it.” Sjncerity with a
capital “S”. “ _

After a somewhat disastrous
ordeal with network politics con-
cerning David Rabe’s Sticks and
Bones, Papp is venturing back onto
the T.V. screen.

“We were supposed to have two
specials.” Papp explains rather
matter-of-factly. “I’ve been play-
ing ‘around with a number of
things, but- they have to be
right...I’m trying to do_ originals
based‘ on_ novels.” Papp made
reference to one in particular --
Ross and Tom. I

' went through the news.

’ BY JIM OPPENHEIMER

it’s very “in” today to bemoan
the “fact” that our culture is going
to ‘hell, our language‘ is being
corrupted and demeaned, and that
the art forms in general have
become a mere shadow of what
they once were. This is certainly
the case with music.

I can understand some of the
feelings behind these pessimistic
remarks when I consider some of
the music being produced today.
Many pieces are literally, or so it

would seem, thrown together for an

occassion, performed once, and
forgotten. There is a lot of music
composed by “c0mmittee”--by
more than one composer. Some-
times, the different contributors
have no idea what the other is
doing. The height of sterility is
reached‘ when we have music

Thoughts on Opera

written by computer. A consider-
able amount of music is now being
written with tongue in cheek--
sometimes subtly humorous, and
sometimes very blatant. Obvious-
ly, the critics conclude, , music is
going downhill fast. Composers
just don’t take their work seriously
any more. Tsk.

I, for one, am getting goddamned
sick and tired of hearing this
garbage. Today, in spite of
anything any person can say to the
contrary, man is treating man
better than ever before in all
history. Training and education in
the arts are available to far more
people than ever before, and
people in the arts are working to
find ways of opening it up even
more to people. Music is no longer
the fat cat’s diversion, but is played
and listened to in the concert hall

by people -from all classes. I don’t
have statistics on it, but I would
imagine that there is far more
music being written today than
ever before. If some of it is trash,
that is nothing new.

What we forget is that our musical
heritage from the past, as we hear
it today, represents only that part
of the music which has. survived.

a Of course it’s pretty good, but even

Beethoven wrote some bombs.
One composer, Meyerbeer, was the
darlingiof his time. His name is
listed, along with the great mas-
ters, along the top of the Carnegie
Museum Building. Yet today, he is
largely forgotten. His music didn’t
last, but the critics of the time were
sure it would. '

works which were condemned as
tripe when’ they premiered. His-

would love it. _

The solution: expose the masses
to better music and the only way to
do that is to make the price of

records and especially concertslow
enough, that people will be willing
to pay. to hear groups that aren’t

outrageously popular; a condition '

which, more often than not, rules
out any possibility that the band
has any talent.

' Similar is the problem with Pitts-

burgh opera. There is not enough

and therefore, a knowledgeable
opera audience is .nearly non-

they have a sensitive director. I’m
real glad that the Pittsburgh Sym-

glad to have heard some of the

have seen some. incredibly fine

away with all these unsupported

some of those younger rich ladies

I'm not very happy with the
reviews that Pittsburgh opera gets

Today, there are a number of

been true in the past, some haven’t

Maybe so. But do we want to pay

most of the really great composers.
Most of them were unbelievably
miserable people who made those

esteem, she is at once isolated and
bombarded. Lonely, but crowded
by too many rules of socialization
and too many messengers of those
rules mascarading as ‘critics.’

But Ellie’s author, Natalie
Petesch, has in mind a particular
model for this character. “I had
just read Gladys Schmitt’s Rem-
brandt,” Petesch recalls, “and I
thought it was the greatest. I had
never met her. I wondered, ‘Who
is this Gladys Schmitt? Where is
she?’ So I ran to the library and
looked her up and found, y’know,
gibberish...what was wrong with
this book, and how she had tried so
hard butqnever quite made it in that
book...all the things that critics do.
And I became so‘ angry. I thought
she deserved a Nobel Award. Later
I found out she had died during this
time, that she had lived in Pitts-
burgh and had taught at CMU.”

So Petesch wrote a story about an
artist and then a novel...And Ellie?
Ellie returned to her High School
Reunion late in her life where the
empty chatter and memory games
terrified her. Later, she was

dismissed as a Representationalist

and forgotten.

Arts Editor

Note: You can count this article as one more disappointment for the
Gods of Columbian Journalism but let’s forget it...enough’s soon going

. to be said of pathetic types.

Heh -h eh .

It has been long enough of a year such that at this end of the black and I

white, a few impressions have been formed. Personally, many of them
call for release and this issue seems appropriately releaseable as any,
This chore of mine, so’called Pitt News Arts & Entertainment Editor,
is a mixture, as is most of life’s activities, of the good and the bad.
I suppose the best of the good is that the activity is cheaper than beer

and twice as time consuming...although the results are not nearly as-

pleasing. Also, the position or whatever one labels the joke, entitles me
to a free ﬁlm or a cup of coffee every so often...so delightful. And
ﬁnally, the position helps convince my parents that I’m not quite the
bum I actually am (which is of upmost importance in terms of ﬁnancial
reality).

The bad of it all isn’t really a matter of work, time or effort but people.

     

 

Now as far as this. job goes, it seems to me that there’s two types of '

people I’ve been exposed to, one type which is easily dismissed and _

one quite pathetic. ,

The first, the dismissable, is the type who has no ability to
comprehend that just perhaps, perfection doesn’t exist and also that
(especially-when the arts are being considered) there’s such a concept
as personal taste. Usually this dismissable type’s rather low and seedy
so therefore quite easy to smell out and merrily send away.

The second miserable type, the pathetic, is the type who is intelligent
and open -minded enough to recognize that others’ tastes and
imperfections exist. But to the second type, this recognization does not

I . carry over to any consideration of the Pitt News. For in the pages of the

Pitt News should lie the glorifying heighth of their own tastes. Each

, word and suggestion should abide only by their highly self-valued

feelings. Oh sure, there’s such a concept as other’s tastes, but in the

Pitt News, they should be ignored. Evidently, each and every writer on .

the Pitt News staff should be in every sense perfect, never -without the
hours to treat each word as if there’s no end to time.

As I've said’, they’re pathetic creatures...permit meta name a few:

--the fool who threatened to savagely cut off my testicles and roll them
down Forbes Avenue because of his personal hatred for ellipses.

--those who complain; bitch and criticize but are too firmly grounded
on their Godly throne to step down and mutter a pleasant, constructive
bit of practical criticism. ' .

--the local film distributor who expects their every film to receive rave ,

reviews but refuses to advertise in any great amount.

--all those in theatre who understand the essence of diminishing time,
the student learning process, flu, lack of money and depression but
can’t comprehend that the same ‘factors exist across the road.

--hewho is so utterly ignorant ‘as"to not understand the difference
between a press release and a review but has the gall to write a letter
insisting that a particular release is a “short sighted” review.

--thosewho fail to recognize that press space is limited and therefore
their asses cannot be excessively kissed and licked inch after inch and
issue after issue.

--and especially those of you who expect me to bow down
apologetically and kiss a few self-righteous feet because you’ve been
insulted by my yet undefined attitude.-

To all of the above, from all of me, Ionly ask that you take this article,
mix it with bits and pieces of glass and then, with all your might, shove
it up your ignorant, pathetic assholes...thank-you.

To Poetry Forum

(Continued from Page 1)
Perhaps, the pet project of the
Poetry Forum is the United States
Award for poets not yet published
in book form. The award has been

A given annually since 1967.

It started with submission of
approximately 500 manuscripts.
Last year the number reached
nearly 1700. .

The award is considered the best
in the country. The Poetry Forum,
through an arrangement with tile

University’ of Pittsburgh Press,
underwrites the publication cost of
the winner's first book. He is
awarded $2000, and receives an
invitation to _appear before the
Poetry Forum audience.

It seems strange that the Poetry
Forum is growing and expanding
while the Pittsburgh Playhouse is
struggling for survival. Hazo
statedthat the theatre needs many
more people’ than the Poetry
Forum, staffed by himself, coor-
dinator Barbara Carlin, and sec-
retary Mary Kay Quillen.

Hazo said, “We work awfully
hard at administering our respon-
sibilities, but on the other hand, all

‘ that we are confronted with finan-
, cially are poets’ fees, hall rentals,

and some miscellaneous costs.”

was first conceived when Hazo
invited W. H. Auden to Duquesne
University to speak about “The
Poet and the City.”

Till that time poets had to be
hosted by universities and the
audience was primarily academic.
Poets wanted to reach a greater
audience. The audience didn’t just
happen, though. It was built up
through nine ‘years of hard work.

“Now poets know about the
International Poetry Forum and

 

like to come here. A poet who
comes here knows he has an
audience.” Hazo explained. “I’ve
had‘ many people tell me that.”
Since its conception, the Inter-
national Poetry Forum has brought
many artists to Pittsburgh. Among
them, Kurt’ Vonnegut-, Jr., Joyce
Carol Oates, Russian poet Yevgeny
Yevtushenko, John Barth. .
Evidently, great poets in poetry’s
“boom town” exist only because of

' the work of the International Poetry

Forum.

In an unprecedented move,
Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre is adding
one performance of Romeo and

three performances in Heinz Hall
Feb. 21, 22, and 23. Restaged for
the third 1 time because of the

PBT is adding a matinee at 2:30
pm, Saturday, Feb. 22 to accom-
modate the overﬂow crowd. (Tic-
kets for this performance are now
on sale.) The move was precipita-
ted by completely sold out houses
of the company’s last two produc-
tions, Nutcracker and Swan Lake.

pro is pleased with his pupil, and

- something like this:

business doesn’t wait for a tennis
game.

Although Walt denies it, some
other jazz musicians around Pitts-
burgh feel he’s more of a
businessman than a jazz pianist.
They don’t feel his arrangements of
contemporary artists’s work like
that of Stevie Wonder and Carole
King meet their own deﬁnition of
jazz. But they don’t fault him for it.
“It might be a bit too commercial
for my taste,” says Nathan Davis of
the University of Pittsburgh’s jazz
program, “but Walt is providing
something the city definitely
needs. And if nothing else, he’s
sure one of Pittsburgh’s most
successful business men, and
there’s nothing wrong with that.”

Walt comes back into the locker
room. The sweat produced by, the
tennis workout still hasn’t com-
pletely driead up and his tee shirt
sticks to his damp body as he pulls
it off. It's in good shape, his body.
Jazz musicians, you know, have a
tendency to get fat. Louis
Armstrong, Charlie Parker, Can-

nonball Adderly. Those guys ain’t'

string beans by no /means. The life
of a jazz musician, it seems, goes
L play, drink,
and smoke all night, then sleep all
day. Walt loves his life, though,
and he tries to take care of it.
“Cigarettes,” he says, “I only
smoke them down at the club, and
even then I try to keep it at a
minimum. I’m into tennis too
much to do anything that’Il slow me
down. Even when I go down to the
islands, that’s about all I do.” He
was born in Jamaica and now owns
a condominium complex down
there. He’s been all over the
world, but its the island he likes
best, he says, “under the palm

trees.” Of course, owning a
condominium helps.

Hisfamily left Jamaica when he
was three and wound up in
Pittsburgh’s Hill District which was
about the only place black people
could go to if they moved into
Pittsburgh in those prewar years.
“It was bad,” he says as he shakes
his head and leaves it at that. He
got an early start on his career,
though. His father was an amateur
honky tonk piano player and his
mother was a singer in the church
choir. “Music just kind of ran in
my family,” he says, and appar-
ently it still does. His older brother
Nate plays saxophone,~ﬂute, and
percussion for Walt’s quintet every
night at the Attic. “The whole Hill
was kind of jazz oriented,” he says,
“Errol Garner comes from the Hill,
and Nate used to play with him
quite a bit. Notprofessionally, but
you know,just fooling around. Of
course there wasn’t much else to
do.”

Walt gets into the shower, but the
water isn’t coming out right. What
the hell,” he says, and gives the
nozzle a yank. Satisﬁed, he
continues.

“When I was in high school was
the first time I guess I decided to
get a band together. That’s where
I got into tennis, too. Up at
Schenley. But anyway, we started,
and before ‘too_long we had some
club dates and then we played on
the college circuit. We were on the
road for about a year. I’m glad we
did it, you know, it was part of the
process. But in a wayll was glad
when it was over.‘ I kind of like to
be settled down.” The steam from
the shower begins to cloud up
the mirror and the chrome ﬁxtures
on the sinks. “I guess the ﬁrst
time lrealized we were going to

    
   
 
 

best.”

make it was about ’58 up at the
Crawford Grill up on the Hill.
People began coming just to hear
us. Man, it was a really nice
feeling.” _The last line comes out
sounding somewhat like part of a
song and the words resonate on the
walls of the small steamy room.
“And then we became the steady
band down at the Hilton,” he
continues, “Seven years we played
down there. New York, yeah, I
thought about New York, Chicago,
but I guess we’re just a native
Pittsburgh band and I figured it

was about time Pittsburgh people-

got a taste of something different.
A place with a little sophistication.
A place downtown that would
swing. And that’s why Iiopened up
the Attic.”

He reached from ‘ behind the
shower curtain for his towel. You
can tell he’s a busy man, he takes
quick showers. He rubs the towel

.over his brown skin, and goose

“The thing iih Walt IS, if It s something he cares about, expect the

» bumps cover his arms. “I gotta get

going,” he says taking a swat at
the fogged up mirror while running
a'comb through his kinky hair.

Dressing quickly,_ he puts on the
same clothes he wore earlier‘, save
the bright blue sweat pants, and
hurries out the door, back through
the garage. He doesn’t seem too
pleased that the elevator doesn’t
come down as soon‘as he touches
the button, and his foot taps a
steady rhythm on the oily concrete.

“You ask if l’ll ever get tired of all
the things I do. Wel1,‘all I can say
is I’ll keep doing them as long as
they keep me happy.” '

He could have said it the way he’d
sung it the night-before. His hand

“Pin gonna swing,...Until I satisfy

. my soul.”
