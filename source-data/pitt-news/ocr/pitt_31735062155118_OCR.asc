Reactions to Election Given

Faculty Members React
Favorably to State Races;
Approve National Results

By DEVRA LEE DAVIS

Members of the University faculty ex-
pressed approval of the national election
results. Most reacted favorably to the out-
comes of the Pennsylvania and New York
senatorial contests. .

Chairman of the Department of‘ Physics,
Professor Frederic Keffer, backed Demo-
cratic candidate Genevieve Blatt for Pennsylvania
Senator. He supported Miss Blatt in order to pre-
vent‘ the demise of the Pennsylvania Democratic
Party. He strongly felt that ‘her vicious primary
struggle with Justice Michael Musmanno, supple-
mented by Senator Clark's diatribe against Mus-
manno, endangered the Democratic party's internal
solidarity.

Professor Keﬁer explained that “if Genevieve
Blatt lost, she lost it herself in the ineffectiveness
of her campaign. The only thing she ever men-
tioned was her opponent. I suspect she lost a lot
of the intellectual vote by failing to discuss speciﬁc
policies.”

The victory of Robert Kennedy over incumbent
Senator Kenneth Keating of New York was prac-
tically inevitable, according to Irvin J. Schulman,
instructor of political science. “Ordinarily -if you

York State, he will win. The failure of previous

Students Discuss Future
Of GOP; Senatorial and

O O
Gubenatorial Elections
By FRED FRANK

The landslide victory of President John-
son was expected by most University stu-
dents. The day-after discussion centered
around the major senatorial and gubena-
tori'al elections and the future of the Repub-
lican Party. ‘

Even_ though students had expected John-
son to win handsomely, some were surprised that
Johnson had failed to carry the more moderate
deep south states such as Georgia and South Caro-
lina. - 4 .~

President of the Young Republicans Bill Valen-
tine admitted that “most of the workers (the Young
Republicans) had expected Goldwater to loose. But
few of us expected him to loose by so much.”

After Goldwater’s and‘ Miller’s concession
speeches at noon on Wednesday, much speculation
began about the future of the Republican party. Most
of the students felt Goldwater could not maintain
the control he now has over the Republicans. Some
felt moderates such as George Romney would gain
control of the natiohal committee.

 Other students felt the substantial victory of

Goldwater Republican George Murphy in Califor-

nia might help the more conservative forces main-

tain.eontrol. Valentine felt “that in the next few
weeks or months there will be an intr.a-party battle,
Goldwater ‘will: come out on, top.?_’

has known for 40 years, in Edge-
wood Presbyterian Church.

When Mrs. Pickering assumed

T her position in 1957, she had 15
' minutes coaching for the job. Her

duties were so light, she explain-
ed, that “for the ﬁrst three years
I "took graduate courses at night
and was able to do one-half of
my reading on the job. Now,
however, I can’t read a page of
anything.

Mrs. Pickering’s job has in-
creased to such dimensions that
she believes her office on the
ﬁrst ﬂoor of the Cathedral is “the
busiest spot in the University.
She has memorized the exten-
sion numbers frequently called

Because the University does not
have a replacement for Mrs.
Pickering yet, she must return to
work Thursday after the wed-
ding. “I expect to be working
through November at least, but
I hope it will not be any longer,”
Mrs. Pickering explained.

Mrs. Pickering graduated from
the University and considers her
family a “Pitt family” because
several generations have passed

through the halls of the Univer-‘

sity. Mrs. Pickering and her pros-

pective husband each have two.

daughters. “Both of us have a
daughter in Texas," Mrs. Pick-
ering commented.

When she leaves, Mrs. Picker-
ing will depart from what she
calls “the most interesting posi-
tion in the whole University.”

Wilkerson Outlines Pressure Tactics

MDC Hosts NAACP Lecturer

By DENNIS BLAZIEB.

Herb Wilkerson, the executive
secretary for the National Asso-
ciation for the Advancement of
Colored People (NAACP), spoke
on “The Goals and Purposes of
the NAA ”
night group of students in Tower
A.

The Cultural Committee of the
Men’s Dorm Council sponsored
Wilkerson’s address.

Beginning his lecture with a
short history of the NAACP, he
stated that the group was found-
ed in 1909 by citizens from all
walks of life. Today the NAACP
is a national organization and has
its main headquarters located in
New York City.

Wilkerson next outlined the
employment tactics that his group
uses, He stated that the NAACP
uses arbitration, demonstrations
or even boycotts to impress in-
dustries with the Negro employ-
ment problem. Wilkerson explain-
ed how the NAACP was forced to
boycott the Duquesne Light C0,,
pay light bills in pennies and clog
telephone lines with employment
questions.

Wilkerson then explained the
group's educational goals. Rep-
resentatives act as school advi-
sors, consultants to boards of

Wilkerson added that the riots_

last summer were caused by bad
housing in large city areas. Tight
quarters combined with frayed
nerves to produce trouble.

Schulman also rejected the New
York Times editorial arguments
against Kennedy. “As Attorney
General, Kennedy had as much
constructive legislative experi-
ence as Iieating. The carpetbag-
ger charge is really not vital, be-
cause the concerns of a senator
are not that parochial.”

“Great senators are national
ﬁgures, not state ﬁgures.” Schul-
man cited a certain inconsistency
of the Times position against car-
petbaggers. When Adlai Steven-
son was considered a possible
candidate for the New York Sen-

  

ate race, the Times endorsed 

“The ultimate criticism of Ken-
nedy as an ambitious politician is

admirable thing in a politician.

.r In its commuter days, the University had little personality to offer its students
. i so some created their own. Student activities and the fraternity system offered some

“outlet but not a common meeting place. So before the Student Union, there was Gus-
4 , tine’s.
Frankie Gusti'ne’s establishment provided for these people, and still does for our

generation, some of that identity we spoke of in our last editorial because it stands,
along with a few other select spots like the Tuck Shop, as a traditional hang-out.
And a hang-out, despite the imagery it conotes of West Side coolness, fills a distinct

ture as well as within themselves.

It is a place to which you can retreat and dim, for awhile at least, the academic
tension outside. It can be a prefab social life, a place to e seen and to ﬁnd a friend.
A place like this is a personality and a security — you know who is down there at
10:30 on weekdays and that the lady will play the organ Friday night while the little
man croons “Way Down Upon the Swanee River.”

But Frankie's will be cleared along with much of the Oakland personality when
the new towers are builtiand construction call for grass growing in Pittsburgh. The
expanse and impact of OakCorp cannot but be admired. If the present seniors wonder
at the change they’ve seen in the past four years, they’ll be lost at their 1970 Home-

coming.

I L need on a campus, where students are still seeking an identiﬁcation within that struc-

But innovation means a loss of tradition, and in this particular case, there seems
to be no substitute. Oakland will be beautiful, a description that now seems a ‘juxta-
position of absurdities, and it will also be cold.

It will be difficult for the students to ﬁnd another hang-out when Oakland is
beautiful, and this is unfortunate because the need for the intimacy and personality

of Gusti'ne’s will still be there.

The Tuck Shop has its function, the new Student
L Union will have its, but we think a great number of students would -like to see the

University _consider leaving some of this personality around—-in its present location

or a new building —— but to salvage some of atmosphere.

Conseriaatism Costly

  Goldwater Brings Disaster

by Allan Schlosser

The two major political
parties in the United States
have traditionally been coali-
tions of diverse groups and
interests. Together, the Re-

' .. .,pu‘blican and Democratic par-

ties constitute what has been

 1/variously labeled the “vital
‘ center,” the “mainstream,”

“consensus,” into
which the
great major-
ity of Amer-
icans fall and
upon which
our uniquie
. political sys-
tem is found-
ed.
I n S a n
. ‘ ~ Francisco,
SCHLOSSER however, the
Republican Party chose to
‘revamp itself along strict
ideological lines. Negating
the mainstream principle,
the spokesmen of Goldwater-
ism resited all compromise
and sought only the support
of those willing to swallow

or the

    

I their doctrine of ultra-con-

servatism. Despite the warn-
ings of party progressives,
the Goldwaterites gleefully

‘ embarked on a one-way jour-

ney to disaster. These mod-
erate Republicans were vin-
dicated in Tuesday’s humili-
ating general election.
‘ Throughout the presiden-
tial campaign Senator Gold-
‘Water claimed to be march-
\ingunder a banner of con-
-servatism, yet he was sin-
gularly unsuccessful in cap-
turing such traditional con-
servative states as Vermont,
Maine, Nebraska, Kansas,
Wyoming, and Utah. Gold-

 ‘- water’s only real strength
' was found in the Deep South,

where his calculated attacks
upon the 1964 Civil Rights
Act were greeted with rare
zeal and affection.

 ,~ THE UTTER weakness of

 Goldwater-Miller ticket
In northern industrial states
led to the defeat of countless
candidates for state and na-

 stionalr office.-i  , both New ‘_

York and Pennsylvania the

. Democrats seized control of

the state legislatures. The
demise of Senator Kenneth
Keating is, of course, the
unavdidableg consequence of
President Johnson’s record
plurality of some 2.4 million
votes. In Illinois, a Johnson
sweep crushed the ambitions
of the Republican candidate
for governor, Charles Percy.
In Ohio (as of this writing),
Robert Taft, Jr. was still an-
other casualty of the Gold-
water debacle.

In the Senate, the Demo-
crats increased their major-
ity to 68-32, while in the
Ho u s e of Representatives
they enjoyed a net gain of
nearly 40 seats. This addi-
tion of 40 representatives
would seem to assure the
Democrats of a workable ma-
jority in the House, the most
signiﬁcant result of which
would be the crippling of the
obstructionist coalition be-
tween Southern Democrats
and conservative Republi-
cans.

This is not, however, a
mere exercise in scapegoat
hunting, in which Senator
Goldwater’s candidacy be-
comes the primary cause of
every Republican downfall.
What does emerge from the
current ruins of Republican-
ism is the fact that a right-
wing candidate cannot win a
national election, and that
the future of the party lies
not with the ultra-conserva-

The

    

I

I¥L

tives but with the moderates.

THE OVERRIDIN G tasks
confronting Republican pro-
gressives is to organize a
concerted drive to recapture
control of the party ‘ma-
chinery from the reaction-
aries. In the Republican Na-
tional Committee, for exam-
ple, an attempt could be
made to force a no - conﬁ-

.dence vote, in an effort to

oust Goldwaterite Dean
Burch. Although such a mo-
tion would probably fail, it
would hopefully trigger a re-

construction of local andi

state organizations by re-
sponsible Republicans.

The party of Abraham
Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt,
and Dwight Eisenhower has
been transmuted into the
party of Barry Goldwater,
Bill Miller, and Strom Thur-
mond. The Republican Party,
if it is to survive, must redis-
cover. its Lincolnian heritage
by committing itself unswer-
vingly to its raison d’etre
civil rights; it must shed its
paranoid distrust of the‘ fed-
eral government by reviving
Teddy Rooseve1t’s progres-
sivism in domestic affairs,
and it must commit itself
anew to multilateral diplom-
acy and restraint in interna-
tional relations.

Reconstruction of the Re-
publican Party must begin
with the painful admission
that Goldwaterism is in fact
antithetical to the tradition
of the Grand Old Party.

Letters To

Homecoming
Rules Suggested

Editor, The Pitt News:

Since Homecoming is this‘ week-
end, the student body ought to
go all out in getting ready for
the big football game of the sea-
son. Now, rm not referring to
cherring loud at games or school
spirit. I realize that Pitt students
are known for their sportsman-
ship and. spirit, and that any
derogatory remarks in connection
with behavior at games is not
well received. My object is to
get the student body organized
so that everyone in the student
section can have .a blast tomor-
row.

The ﬁrst thing that should be
done is to have the concession-
aires only ﬁll the 25 cents cokes
halfway so that no time is wast-
ed gulping down a few swallows
before putting in the rum. This
would not only give the conces-

. sionaires more of a proﬁt but it

would also lessen the chance of
spilling coke over the person
next to you.

In regard to the passing of
empty liquor bottles from the
top of the student section to the
bottom, the person who kicks the
bottle into the row below should
warn the person in front of him
that a bottle is coming down. In
t1;.~.~ way the chance of getting

, cut by broken glass is averted.

Also, no bottles should be passed
during the kick-off, the “Alma
Mater” or the “Star Spangled
Banner” because everyone has to
stand up and a student landslide
might occur.

That's enough on school spirits.
The next point to make Home-
coming a rousing success is the
tunnel on the ﬁeld. If a student
has a weak heart, he should re-
turn to the bleachers before the
football players go all the way
through the tunnel because he
might be trampled in the stam-
pede back to the seats. For the
same reason it is also not a good
idea to stand in front of the
band’s seats before the band sits
down.

I must praise the student body
for its cheering. Not only have
they mastered the words to Pitt’s
complicated cheers— “First and
Ten, Do It Again!” and “Fite Pitt
Fite”—but they have shown great
originality in making up their
own. The best A examplexof this

is that great cheer “Kill! Kill!
Kill!” which reminds me of those
glorious days in the R.oman Col-
osseum. ‘ _

Also, the way individual fra-
ternities start up cheers praising
themselves as bigger drunks than
the fraternity next to them is
appreciated. It’s always a nice
idea to know_who are the loudest
drunks on campus. . I hope the
practice continues for this rea-
son. A _ .

I hope my suggestions are
taken to heart, so that everyone
can have a good time at the
game tomorrow. If it works out,
perhaps next year even more im-
provements can be made such as
having two spirit awards -— a
trophy for banners and another
for liquid spirit consumption.

Keep Sports
On Sports Page

Editor, The Pitt News:

I notice you have ﬁnally given
coverage to coed athletics (Pitt
News, Oct. 30). Thanks to a far-
seeing news editor, such cover-
age has ﬁnally appeared in your
paper. Unfortunately, coverage
for the girls’ hockey team does
not belong on the news pages.

Possibly the sports staff is prej-
udiced against female writers (I
notice no female sports writers
listed among your» reporters).
This, however, is no reason to
prohibit coverage of female ath-
letic activities on the sports
pages. I commend your cover-
age Of girls’ hockey, but in the
future, put it where it belongs-—
the sports page.

Elegant Suggests

  

a

Policy for Leaders

By LINDA GOLDSTEIN

Foreign correspondent Robert
S. Elegant, addressing a sparse
audience in the Student Union
Supper Room Wednesday, depart-
ed from his topic, “America
Votes: How a New Administra-
tions Affects the World,” to speak
on how the administration should
affect the world.

Elegant, who is chief of News’
week’s Central Europe Bureau,
said that he was disturbed about
America’s over-concern with mir-
ope and the belief that as long
as Europe is running smoothly,
all problems are solved.

“Europe exports goods, but the
export of ideas comes from Asia,”
Elegant declared, adding that
“unfortunately, most of it comes
from Red China.” He described
Red China’s philosophy as a be-
lief that the spirit is more im-
portant than the ﬂesh. Starting
with armed revolution, China’s
plan is to create a state of so-
cialism which would soon make
a transition to communism.

Red China’s grand design, said

 

ROBERT S. ELEGANT
Newsweek journalist

Elegant. is that out of the chaos
in the underdeveloped world will
come control. The capitalist world
will soon be isolated from its
Sources of raw material, the peo-

ple will revolt. and China will . ‘

be able to step in and dominate
the scene.

Elegant claimed that the Unit-
ed States should open channels
of communication with the Chi-
nese. He emphasized that the Red
Chinese are unaware of what is
going on in the rest of the world,
and to illustrate his point, he de-
clared that Mao Tse-tung believes
that people are starving on the
streets of Chicago.

He proposed that we must rec-
Ognize Red China, even though
it would not be accepted without
Formosa. It is now a major de-
feat when Red China is recog-
nized by other countries. If the
United States offers recognition

1‘

GBOUNII ELOOR

and it is refused, then we can
play the role of a martyr, Ele-
gant said, adding that this might
be a very beneﬁcial role to play.

If Red China accepts our rec-
ognition, the ﬁrst beneﬁt of the
gestures would be admission to
the United Nations. This mem-
bership, Elegant noted, would be
beneﬁicial to our ‘point of view,
for it would serve to enlighten
Red China on the state of the
outside world. '

Elegant conceded that “Red
China is a. dangerous country,
which is exactly why we should
recognize her. There is the grow-
ing fear of atomic confrontation
which could be set off by the
Chinese.”

We cannot afford Elegant said,
to continue our present policy
of ignoring Red China.

 Interview:

ByJOEL BEELR

(Robert Elegant, author of the
book “The Center of the World”
visited campus Wednesday to
give a midday series lecture.)

 

>Mr. Elegant, as you know,
last week’s Midday speaker Dr.
Hans Morganthau stated that the
only way to win in Viet Nam,
short of the extermination of the
Vietnamese people would be war
with China. Do you have any
comments on this?

I don’t propose to get into a
debate with Hans Morganthnu
particularly when I didn't hear
what he said. . . . However, I
don’t think he knows What he is
talking about, and I don’t think
he possesses the credentials in
this case and the experience to
give us a valid statement on it.
. . . As far as I’m aware he has
not made and particular study
of China or of any Communist
guerilla movements in Asia. I
think he’s completely wrong. I
would reverse the situation, and
say that unless we are prepared

 R Robert Elegant

to engage in a continuous guerilla
action in order to contain them
we will ﬁnd ourselves sometime
in the next ten to 15 years faced
with a real war against the
Chinese.

>Do you have any practical
recommendations as to how we
can stop them in South Vietnam?

No Asian Communist or Guer-
illa revolt has come to success
except when it has had a con-
tiguous border for supplies. I
think that supply line, which at
the present time runs through
Laos has to be cut. And we have
to use American troops to cut
that line. Secondly, I think we
ought to employ counter guerilla
action.

> You refer to counter-guerilla
action. By this, do you mean use
of Vietnames troops or also so
called American .advisors?

I don’t desire to see American .

troops engaged on the soil of a
Communist country. If the South
Vietnamese can be convinced
that there is a hope in this, then
they can do the job themselves.

    
   
  
   
         

> Can you access the two re-
cent secretary of states, John
Foster Dulles and Dean Rusk?

Oh Dear — Dulles made an
awful lot of noise. That was his
prime characteristic, On the other
hand, at least you felt that some-
thing was being accomplished.
With Rusk, you don’t have the
same feeling of action. However,
because of policies instituted un-
der Dulles and Achenson, Rusk
has been able to reap a number
of scuccesses. It’s hard to com-
pare the two because Dulles was a
ﬂaming extrovert whereas Rusk
is a terrible introvert.

> Can you tell us who are the
architects of our Southeast Asian
Policy?

I have often Wondered that my-
self. I think seriously that these
things just happen.

Thank you Mr. Elegant.

PETE BILLEY

(Continued from Page 12)

ANOTHER REASON Bil-
ley is currently playing
with the fourth team is the
way he worked out for his
halfback position this year.
“I conditioned myself very
wrong,” he explained.” I
was always runnin’ or lift-
in’ weights. What I shoulda’
been doin’ was playin’ bas-
ketball, and doin’ the kinds
of things that would sharp-
en my reflexes.”

YOU GET the impression
from talking to Billey that
he thinks he should be high-
er than the fourth team. He
doesn't say it, but he still
feels it necessary to make
excuses for his coaches. “I
can't blame the coaches for
playing me on the fourth
team,” Billey said. “There
are younger guys on the
team who are faster and
bigger than me. I’m a sen-
ior with no future here.

SA TU RDA Y’S FOOTBALL
GAME might not give the
Panther fans much to cheer
about. The defense will be
out to get Notre Dame quar-
terback John Huarte. If
they don't, it will be a long,
long afternoon. Take Notre
Dame i'n an easy game, .32-6.

‘Fighting Irish’s’ Statistics
A Back Up Undefeated Slate

A look at Notre Dame’s statis-
tics, shows why the Irish have
6-0 record and are rated number
one in the country.

In six games the Irish have
held the opposing team to 0.94
yards rushing per attempt. They
have outgained their opponents
on the ground, 1,177-183. Bill
Wolski has accounted for 468 of
these yards on 94 attempts, scor-
ing eight times.

At end, All-American candi-

A date Jack Snow has matched

Notre Dame records in passes
caught and touchdowns passes
received with 41 receptions of
which seven were carried for
scores. He has already shattered
the Irish all-time passing yard-

age gained with 741. He has
averaged 18 yards per catch.

Quarterback John Huarte has
completed 72 of 128 attempts for
1,273 yards and 12 touchdowns.

Defensive standouts are back
Tony Carey, who has intercepted
seven passes, and linebacker Jim
Carroll, who has been credited
with 91 tacklse.

To See Panthers Meet Notre Dame

(Continued from Page 12)

Number 85 that Michelosen was
referring to is Jack Snow who
has already broken Notre Dame
pass receiving records. He has
caught more passes after six
games than any Irish end has
caught in a whole season.

The defensive line is the other
reason for Notre Dame’s success.
They are mostly sophomores.
Parsehlan put the four biggest
men whom he could ﬁnd on the
line and taught them what to do.
They average 235 pounds.

To counteract the Irish’s
strength the Panthers should
have three seniors returning to
the line-up. Bill Howley, Bill Bo-
dle, and Ron Linaburg all have
been running with the “A” unit
in practices.

A change which was instituted
in the Syracuse game is Michel-
osen’s decision to play two pla-
toon football. He has all but dis-
carded the A and B teams and
has used several specialists.

He has used Tippy Pohl‘ and
Bob Dyer in the defensive back-

ﬁeld. Also Ray Popp and Bernie

La Quinta have -been playing de-
fense and Josh Uovegratz and
Bob Sorochak have been playing
offensive guards. Marty Schotten-
heimer plays defensive lineback-
er replacing offensive center Paul
Cercel.

the beginning of the season has
been Pohl. He plays defensive
safetyman and with Notre Dame’s
great passing game he will be
one of the key men in the de-
fense.

“From what we have seen
from the game movies I would
say that Huarte is as good throw-
er as Bob Berry or Roger Stan-
bach,’_’ said Pohl. “He throws a

great long pass and always has

a lot of time to throw the ball.
Our line will have to put up a,
good rush.

“Either Dale Stewart or Jim

. I

Dodaro will take Jack Snow if he
rims a sideline pattern or a long
pattern, but if he does a hook
pass or a post pattern it will be
my job to watch him for we play
a zone type defense.

“They specialize in throwing
long hook passes of about 15-20
yards because Huarte has a lot
of time to pass. It's also my job,
however, to stop the long bomb
or easy touchdown. Against Bob
Berry one got by me (Ed.—-for a

touchdown), but actually I did
almost intercept it.”

The Panther basketball team is
still holding daily practices at
Fitzgerald Field House. Coach
Bob Timmons has tried several
combinations and still hasn't
come up with the line-up he is
sure of using at the beginning
of the season.

His line-up in a practice game
against some of the old Pitts-
burgh Rens Team was about as
expected. He had Stan Falenski
and Larry Sykowny at guards,
Bob Lovett at center and Daryll
Ruby and Tom Roantree at for-

wards.

DALE STEWART
Defensive Skills Will Be Tested

’ByFR.ANKSMIZlK

The number one team in the country will be the Panthers’ OP-
ponent tomorrow before .a near sell-out Homecoming Day C1‘0Wd-
Notre Dame coach Ara Parsegian has revitalized last year’s team
which posted a 2-7-1 record into a national powerhouse which now
sports a 6-0 record. ‘

What does coach John Michelosen think the big difference is in
Notre Dame football? “Probably the big thing Parseghian has done

 J is to instill a new spirit into the team. This new spirit has Onﬁe

again brought pride in the football tradition that has been lacking

it  at Notre Dame.”

“A11.isn’t pride, however, that quarterback and No. 85 have

it ‘i played terriﬁc football as has the youngdefensive line, which is the

biggest we will face all season.” 6

Quarterback John Huarte, as Michelosen said, makes the offense
go. For the two years he wasn’t a letter winner. “He was always their
best thrower, but he inst never got a chance,” explained Michelosen.

(Continued on Page 10)

With It

 By Marvin Zelkowitz

THE HAND THAT STOPPED THE MAN
HALFBACK PETE Billey held up his right hand. He
closed his hand into a fist. When he opened it again, his
index finger remained crooked. “I only have 95 per cent
retraction in that finger,” Billey said.

 

    

Billey looked down the back of his hand. It was a
a jumble of brown scar tissue and white, unmarked skin.
He had almost lost that hand in an accident two summers
ago. He was working trimming a tree with a chain saw
when the saw slipped and sliced through Billey’s hand. “I
shouldnta’ been up there with the chain saw anyway,” Billey

 said. “I guess it was really my fault.”

’ VBILLEY HAD missed spring practice the preceding year

for a knee operation. Billey also missedthe next year’s

spring practice. He feels that missing that much work :
" has hurt his football instincts, and blames his lack of

work for his present fourth team position.
