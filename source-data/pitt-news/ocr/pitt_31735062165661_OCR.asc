August 1963 will be conducted by
the University Placement Service

.-_during the week of January 7.
Seniors are required to attend at

Designed to explain the func-
tions of the Placement Service
and distribute information about
campus interviews, these sessions
given by Dr. Ritenour,_help pre-
pare the student for the coming
job interviews.

Seniors were to have picked up
employment forms, ﬁlled them

than 400 companies from all
parts of the United States will

age 2 _--,'rH_ PITT.NEVI’S -

Preliminary steps are now be-
ing taken to establish a program
of linguistics at the University.
The project is under the guidance
of Dr. Gerd Fraenkel, a newly ap-
pointed associate professor of
English.

More than the learning of lan-'
guages, linguistics is the scienitﬁc
study of language involving struc-
ture and form. “It is,” says Dr.
Fraenkel, “the most scientiﬁc of
the arts.”

Linguistics Helpful

A knowledge of linguistics is
helpful to both the student and
the teacher of language. Intimate
knowledge of the structure of

French, for instance, makes it
easier for an instructor to teach
English to a Frenchman. Students
who understand the form and
structure of a foreign language
are helped to grasp it easily and
accurately.
-"Now that the University is
stressing international dimen-
sions and is planning to expand
its services to include such a
country as Equador, the need
for a sound linguistics program
is greater than it was even a
decade ago,” said Dr. George
Crouch, chairman of the De-
partment of English.
Trainedilinguists are called for
in academic, governmental and
private organizations. Increasing
numbers of people who speak
other languages wish to master
English and therefore have to be
given expert training. A
Taught at Indiana
Dr. Fraenkel, chairman of the
U n i_v e r s i t y’s Interdisciplinary
Committee on Linguistics, came
here from Indiana University
where he was a lecturer in,lin-
guistics. At Indiana he was also
assistant director of the Air Force
Language Program, a project In
applied linguistics. He was
brought to the University to start
a linguistics program-
Fraenkel was born in Ger-
i many and spent 21 years in Is-

Educational

kFunds Set Up

Five scholarships and fellow-
ships for. teachers and other edu-
cation personnel have been es-
tablished by the alumni of the
University’s School of Education.

Applications for the awards are
now being accepted for summer
and fall of 1963, according to Dean
Paul H. Masoner and Mrs. Ber-
tha Gifﬁn, president of the school
of Education Alumni Association.

The scholarships were made
possible by alumnicontributions
and were provided “to encourage

educators of ability to develop
their potential more fully through
graduate study,” Mrs. Giﬂin said.
Applicants need not be graduates
of the University or residents of
this area, but they must meet Uni-
versity standards for graduate
work. The awards will be made
by a faculty committee.

The following awards were es-
tablished: three graduate fellow-
ships offering students $950 sti-
pends per trimester, plus three-
fourths of their tuition and fees;
one scholarship, renewable for
three trimesters, carrying a $500
‘stipend each term; and one $250
stipend for study during a sum-
mer term.

rael. He is the author of a text-
book on Israel to be published

next year. Proﬁcient in He-
brew, German and English,
Fraenkel also .reads Turkish,

Azerbaijani, Arabic, French and
some Russian, Hungarian and
Japanese.

The program eventually may
become a formal department of
linguistics. “We may decide,”
Fraenkel said, however, “that a
more ﬂuid program is /to be de-
sired rather than a department.”

Few Departments

Only a handful of institutions,
among them Columbia, Harvard
and Indiana, have formal depart-
ments in the ﬁeld. The ﬁrst aim
of the 11-man committee which

Fraenkel heads will be to set‘ up
minor in the ﬁeld.

Courses in ﬁeld methods of
linguistics, types of /linguistics
structures, language and cul-
ture, phonetics, the psychology
of speech, and the history of
various languages are now given
by a group of departments. in
the University. Their offerings
will be expanded as the pro-
gram grows. —

~-The departments particularly
concerned are anthropology, Eng-
lish, romance languages, Slavic
languages, "speech, theatre arts,
and C h i n e s e. Complementary
courses are also offered by the de-
partments of philosophy and so-
ciology. The Linguistics Program
at the University will also sched-
ule work in the emergence of new
national languages.

the students interested in the var-

 letters to the Editor

iChap|ains Question
.Ncoho| Article

Editor, The Pitt News .

The last issue of The Pitt
News (December 12, 1962) car-
ried an article by Matt Swetonic
and a letter by Robert K. Meyer
concerning the question of the
University’s sanction of the use

' of alcohol on campus.

The writers object to the fact
that churches (in this case the
Meth od i st and Presbyterian
Church are involved) have tak-
en an absolute moralistic stand
on an issue that is,,in many
ways, ambiguous and relative.
Inasmuch as the stand is inter-
preted as absolute we believe
the criticism of these writers
‘to be valid.

It is not the responsibility of
the church to determine Univer-
sity policy on this or any other
issue. The church, however,

' must be concerned abou' moral
. al»th ou gh moralistic .
preachments which do not deal

issues,

realistically with actual condi-
tions are less then helpful.
The response of Mr. Swetonic
and Mr. Meyers seems inadequate
since they seem to take great
delight in ascribing to a strange
kind of moralism of "their own.
Mr. Swetonic speaks of a Uni-
versity’s “rightful share of al-
coholic relaxation.” Mr. Meyer
proclaims it “impossible” to run
a society without the “greatest
medicant for the relief of ten-

A V lion known to man.”

Some of the churchmen writ-
ing University ofﬁcials concern-
ing this issue are undoubtedly
naive moralists who do not un-
derstand the issue at stake or
the need for realistic solutions.
It appears, however, that the
;writers in your last issue are
also somewhat naive.

be rejected. Letters should be
addressed‘ to: Letters to the
Editor, 407 Schenley Hall.

The main points of contro-
versy before University officials
are not, in our judgement, mat-
imposed ‘moralism or
radical individualism. Rather,
the officials University
have two far more important
problems. The ﬁrst is the legal

problem of serving alcoholic
beverages to persons under’, 21
years of age. This is a particular
problem because most under-
graduates are under 21.

The second. problem is that
alcoholism is a serious disease
in our society today. As a for-
midable institution in that so-
ciety, we believe the University
should exercise a concern for
this and any other problem that
plagues society. ‘

We_realize the University is
facing a difficult decision which
only can be made by the Uni-
versity itself. _However, we
would suggest the above factors
be considered in the fo"mation
of a decision.

Tattered, frocked and bearded is the order of
the day at Portuga1’s oldest and most well known
university — The University of Coimbra in Coim-
bra, Portugal. The University sits on one of the
hills overlooking the city and A
goes down to the River Mondego
that runs’ through the city.

The male students, unlike
American students, dress in long,
black ‘capes worn over black

also wear these capes -although
they are not mandatory. _These
frocked ﬁgures capture one’s in-
terest immediately but their
tattered T hemlines fascinate the
average V onlooker. Each- time a

I

Coimbra student passes a course, he is permitted to
make a six-inch ‘slit in the hemline of his cape.
Therefore, by the time the Coimbra student gradu-
ates, his cape is so tattered that it no longer repels
the cold but ﬂutters in the brisk, chilly breezes of-
Portugal’s rainy winter" season. -

In the capital city‘ of Lisbon, the students attract
particular attention through ‘their ﬂagrant gal-
lantry. These students have been known to throw
their capes. down before women and ladies crossing
the water-eddied streets. The unsurpassed tribute
for a girl ‘to receive from a Coimbra student is to
have a rose thrown before her, Generally, if the
student has a girl friend, he wears a rose beneath
his cape in her honor. If not, one could be among
the chosen few, to have a rose thrown at her feet
by a Coimbra gallant. -
‘I8 at Handball , —

Sports activity in this institution is highly
spirited through ,a form of court handball which is

one of the fastest moving games ever to be wit-A

nessed. A small ball about the size of a hockey
ball'is batted across the court in the air by two
teams ofunine members. Therespective goalies
provide unprecedented entertainment through their
theatrical defense action.

Social “life for the University students is full A

and spontaneous. The Coimbra student traverses
through the various “Tascas,” which are dark,

small wine cellars in a red-checked tablecloth

‘V .
Cripple

Wandering through streets she has no place

similar to our American coﬁee houses, replete with
singing on table tops, dancing and general revelry.

establishments are called, “Casa da Cha” (Tea-

' Another ‘tradition is,‘ the celebration entitled_
“Quema das Fitas,” which is a celebration of rib-

students to indicate their "proximity to graduation.

Simultaneously, thisvis a celebration’ of ‘much se're-

Medics Receive

$23,290 Grant

A special research‘ grant of
$28,290 from the U. S. Public
Health Service will enable path-
ologists at the University to em-
ploy a reﬁned technique of study-

diﬁferent normal and diseased
cells.
Called the “Histochemica1 Lo-

calization of Oxidative Cells,” this
research grant will be re-awarded
in similar amounts for ﬁve addi-
tional years.

Dr. Emmanuel Farber, the
principal investigator for the
project, said the new technique
-supplements older tissue meth-
ods, and may have certain ad-
vantages. The new method will
permit the study of enzymes in
a normal location
structure, a study which was
not possible in older methods
because the tissue is ground up.

Dr. .Farber and his associates in
the Department of Pathology in
the University’s School of Medi-
cine have done considerable work
thus far using the new technique.

s.c..1.g...H.... Reporters

BY J0 NELSON

“It is ironical for me to discuss
aspects of American society and
culture with foreign reporters who
have been here for as long as
twelve years,” said Dr. Burkhart
Holzner, who came from Germany
in 1957. Dr. Holzner, of the Uni-
versity’s Sociology Department,

however, has, on several occasions, ‘

addressed foreign correspondents
visiting the University.

The group of reporters, coming
from New York and Washington,
D.C., ‘attend seminars in univer-
sities all over the country. At the
University, these seminars are
sponsored by the Government Af-
fairs Institute. , _ G

His remarks concern Ameri-

can "values and the dominant
themes underlying our society.
These he summarized as equali-
tarianism, liberalism, and the
desire for accomplishment and
efficiency. Also, he outlines the
basic American institutions,
government, education, ‘econom-
ics, and religion.

Most of the correspondents, ac-
cording to Dr. Holzner, are well-
versed on America, but there is
a small minority who seriously
attack the stereotyped ideas about
American society. They think that
Americans are hypocrites for not
living up to the standards they
profess. ’Conformity is attacked
vic'iously.’The minority is horri-
pﬁed at the non-religious functions
of the American churches.

. Dr. Holzner has also address-
ed students at the University.
He talked with a group at Hol-
land Hall about such topics as
the conditions under which
ideological movements arise and
the ; factors which ” determine
their direction. They also tried
to determine. why Fascism and
Communism have become im

portant world forces. ’

“I really enjoy talking to_stu-
dents about matters of major in-
tellectual importance,” comment-
ed Dr. Holzner. He added that he
was pleased to discover how in-
tense students were about major
sociological .problems. “Students
show more interest than they are
generally supposed to have in
American society.” According;to
Dr. Holzner, students are willing
to really work to develop solid
concepts about society.

Dr. Holzner feels that social
scientists are "under some-what
of an obligation’ to act as inter-
preters of society. He feels that
it is their dutyto give students
a workable interpretation of, the
world around us.

He concluded that “it is im-
portant for social scientists of all
kinds to be aware of their obliga-
tion to act as interpreters and to
discuss with students issues of
public importance.” *

 

S E N I O R COMPREHENSIVE
examinations in ‘major subject
areas are, being adopted at
Hartwick College. Thenew sys-
ten will not change the present
method of testing a student at
the time he studies a subject
but will require him to synthe-
size all of the knowledge which
he has accumulated during four
years at college.

“It Goes On..."

 

A MATTER, OF PRIDE

Fred Lewis’s inheritance falls a little shy of what was
left to Nelson Rockefeller. , V

Lewis inherited a Syracuse University basketball team
that won two games last year while losing 20. Lewis was
imported to reverse the situation. He had enjoyed consider-
able success at Southern Mississippi University.

Syracuse is already a better team. They have won
three games so far while dropping five-—including a hor-
rendous 87-51 -shellacking here.“

‘ But Lewis, wants no part ofthe achievement. In fact, he
apparently wants no part of the team. Although they tra-iled

the‘Panthers by as’ much as 40 points at one period the

Orangemen were only down, 34-29, at halftime.

“We just shot way _over
our heads, that’s 'all,” Lewis
opined. “We were wide open
and we just happened to
score..’,’ A ,

Too Much Discipline? V

He then explained wh
his team uses what is known
as a “discipline-shot” offense
wherein a team plays control

cally for the sure shot.

“We use it because we
“don’t have any ‘shooters on
the team,” Lewis said. “You
know I . don’t really "have
much to 'work with out
there.” . .

 This coincided with

the remarks .-Lewis had

_ made at courtside the day

_. Fred I-°W|$ , before, during a practice

, drill. “These are the poorest excuses for athletes that I’ve

ever seen,” he told Coach Bob Timmons. “And the shame
of it is that they’re all on full sc_holarship‘s.” _

Lewis is a" good basketball coa“ch_and, he doesn’t want to
assume any blame for the lacklusterclub he has. The fresh-
man team he recruited for Syracuse this year is reportedly
better than the varsity already. They have beaten them in
scrimmage sessions.

Lewis Cautions “anthers

Lewis lent a word of caution, however. “Pitt better not
let this affect their outlook next year,” he exclaimed. “When
they come up our place things will be different because none
of these guys are going to be around then.”

The Panthers meet Syracuse on a home-and-home basis
in. 1964. . V ~ . .
Lewis was also quite vocal during the game. “That

officiating would make Dr. Naismith.turn over in his
. grave,” he spouted at one interval. He accused brawny

Brian Generalovich of “moving around out there like a

Sherman tank.” , " . '

Referee Petey Gallo was in Lewis’. face_once. “You sit
"down and just shut up,” Gallo cried. This was the second
instance in a week where a local official had silenced a visit-
ingcoach. Joe Sariscak, ﬂushed red in the face, put a halt to

the histrionics of Princeton’s Bill van Breda Kolif on New
Year’s Eve.

Van Breda Kolff cried about officiating throughout
the Tiger affair and fell off his chair once in the excite-
ment. -

Perhaps Gallo and Sariscak bothtreadthe recent story
in The Saturday Evening Post called “Basketball’s Bullies”
in which veteran oﬁicial Al Lightner blasts reckless coaches
“who disgrace our colleges.”

Si-iiiing Voices

“Coaching from the sidelines should be dropped,” argues
a much-maligned Lightner. “I don’t believe in gluing a man
to his bench, only in stilling the voice that’ sparks riots.

“Rowdyism in basketball,” says Lightner, “contri-
butes directly to a deeper and more serious problem, one
that basketball has so far been unable to solve—the
‘fix’ scandals that keep breaking out, season after season.

. “When gamblers see open deﬁance of authority, officials
held in contempt, coaches stirring up trouble and colleges
making no move to_ control the situation, they ﬁgure it’s a
logical step for them to move‘ in. _

“A gambler in Kansas City told me,"You know why kids

can. be bought? They‘ watch their coach panic" and go crazy ‘

when he’s losing and they feel awful. By the_ time they’re
seniors, they’ve seen so tmuch daffy stuff they. think the whole
game‘ is nuts‘ and why _shoul

dn’t they make money. out of.

By BOB SMIZIK

Its toughest week of wrestling in many years faces the
Pitt wrestling team this week as they take on two nationally
ranked teams, Iowa State and Syracuse. ’

Their loss to Michigan makes the Panthers a poor bet
against these two powerhouses, but don’t be too surprised if
the team pulls an upset in at least one of these matches.

The Panthers have the kind of‘
team that is capable of doing this. ' -V ' »

expected to ﬁeld its best team in

The unlikely prospect of a Panther wrestling team hav-

Peery’s charges take on two of the country’s top ranked-
teams, Iowa State and Syracuse. ,

The Iowa State match, to be held in the Washington, Pa.
high school gym tonight, pits the wrestlers against the
number ﬁve team in the country‘

performers. I

Carl Poplar will work the par-

sophomore Sid Oglesby will
probably work the still rings.

The Panther team, with one ex-
ception, is in good physical shape.
The exception is John Franchuk,
ace parallels man, who has an
aggravated pulled chest muscle
and will not be able to participate
in either the Syracuse meet or the
Springﬁeld meet on Monday.
Team captain Ed Zamecnik will
replace Franchuk on the parallel

Zamecnik on the horizontal bar,
Roland James on the side horse

Review of ‘Brother to the Enemy’

Memoirs of Chase

Of Benedict Arnold

By JIIVI O’BRIEN

Light Horse Harry Lee wrote
the story of his gigantic Sergeant-
Major and his attempt to capture
Benedict Arnold in his memoirs,
which was published in 1869 with
a foreword and annotations by
his considerably more famous son,
Robert E. Lee.

The Sergeant-Major’s name was
John Champe. Bart Spicer has
taken this material, the facts are
much the same, and written pow-
erful historical fiction, Brother to
the Enemy (Bantam Book; 246
pp.; 50c).

Dynamic Hero

Spicer‘s hero is ingeniously
called John Champion, a dynamic
leader with the build OI a black-
smith, a violent temper, and a
stinging, caustic tongue. Spicer
is sensitive both to the environ-
ment oi the story and the dia-

logue of his characters. It makes
for a powerful mixture.

After the defection of Bene-
dict Arnold, the unrivaled mil-
itary leader of the time, Cham-
pion is told “to go to New York
and bring him back.”

“The only fighting General
worth a damn in the whole stupid
Army,” Champion declared. “And

he went sour. I can’t believe it.
There must be more to it."

The Hard Way

And there is. Champion found
this out when he seemingly de-
serted the American forces and
pursued his quixotic mission. He
had misgivings; he admired Arn-
old. And even General Washing-
ton didn’t give him much of a
chance of succeeding.

Champion was the Sergeant-
Major of Washington’s best cal-
vary unit. For four years he
had waited for a promotion that
had never come. His opportu-
nities with Arnold seemed un-
limited.

Arnold was sincere. He had a
disdain for Congress which he
claimed had sold out to France.
He said no one wanted independ-
ence from England in the begin-
mng.

Based on Bad

He said all his actions were
based on a love for his country,
however, “it may appear incon-
sistent to the world, who very
seldom judge right of any man’s
actions,” he said.

Champion’s task was further
complicated by a time element
when he was supposed to get
Arnold soon so they wouldn’t have
