Presents

On  Town  

It’s ,“On -The ~Town” for the
Nixon “benefit Monday, March 4.
“But'it"sA.not “on the house”_as
far as tickets are concerned,” says
Muriel 1’Gu,sky, ticket Cll£ll.FlTla'll.
“Tickets ion. the ‘benefit will be

“On The Town" ‘ which ran for
sixty weeks on Broadway is the
work of ‘, Betty Comden and
Adolph Grgéen (authors of “Mil-
lion:Dollar Baby”) with music by
Leonard Bernstein. I H

The -plot of this musical revue
centers around three sailors on a
week-end‘ leave in New York.

pon arrival there they see a
picture of “Miss Subway.” They
decide that the one thing they

want to dois find and date her.=

Withj..thre_e sailors on a wild dash
to ﬁndone beautiful woman any-
thing _is liable to happen, and
does. ' ‘

,In spite of. the booking difﬁ-,

-culty, thecommittee ‘has gone on
with p1a,r1s. According to Nancy
‘Graper, chairman, “On The T-own”
is a. show everyone‘ will. like-
stu»d..ents,V parents, and A- alumni

The use of the Link trainer will
-be two-fold. Flrs.t., those taking
elementary ﬂight training
desire a few Link trainer lessons
as an adjunct to their lessons in
the air. Second, those who al-
rc;.1cly c<)nsidc’:'a,:ble ﬂying experi-
ence may use Link trainer time
in. partial fu.lfill.m.ent -of C. A. A.
rcqurements for in.~_-<tru.mc.nt rat-
ing.‘ a

The Pitt Link trainer rates are
also relatively low, $6 per hour.

St.udcn.t.s desiring only a few Link.

trainer lessons without University
credit may secure them in multi-
ples of half hour units. For those
who desire a. regular Link trainer

course two one—crcdit courses are. _ ‘ A V‘  _

prerequisite is a knowledge of
navigation or flying experience.
In addition to the $10 tuition fee,
each one credit course involves a
laboratory charge of $60 for the
10 hours of Link training included
in the work. The 20 hours of Link
obtainable in the two courses,
when combined with 20 hours of
instrument training in the air,
available through Miller Aviation,
constitute the number of instru-
ment ﬂight training hours required
by the C.A.A. for instrument rat-
ing.

"Stanton C. Crawford, dean of

the ‘college and chairman of the‘

university’s Aviation committee,
commenting on this latest devel-
opment in Pitt's Aviation pro-
gram, stated: “For some time we
have felt that ﬂight training should
be made part of the curriculum.

Vet Sketches 

Demeter doesn’t remember ex- ”
actly why he joined the Navy,
other than that times were hard
in '.fDecember, 1934, with jobs
scarce and ‘the future grey and
‘doubtful. ‘It just seemed the only
tlri.ng“to.:do. The Navy was be-
ginning ‘.=tO e-expand and offered,
penhaps,.the most. secure future to
a young ‘man just out of high
school. " _\
.-After he had received l'iis,yeo-
'm.an.training .at Norfolk, .VirgFnia.
he «was assigned to the battleship-
Corloradoattached to the Paciﬁc
Fleet. When, shortly atte:‘w;‘§rd.
the,;.cr'.uiser Vtncennes was -co-m-
m«iss,ione,d, he was tranisferred to
her;-and sailed on her shake—down
cruises to wscandanavia -an"‘d Europe.
Later,‘ he asked for and got a
year’s .duty;,.in the P-.anama Canal
Zone aasga inachinistwithﬂ an avia-
tion patrol squadron.
-Despite all;his travel, the change
of .scene, and ..diversiIie.ation of
duty, iﬂemeter was restless and
dissatisﬁed. When, after the Jap-
anese ..had bombed .Pearl Harbor,
he ..W.;a_s still doing desk ‘work on a
receiving ship . in i New V York Har-
bor,'.;_he could stand it_.»n—o longer

got the actionhhe craved. "It was
in t'Dctoher,  E943, aboard the sub-
-marine Puﬂer in oneof the n-ar-
r-ow.«:st:x=.a'its rthat dividéi the many
 .;around Australia. ‘The
Builder xwas -surfaced fwhen the
crew spotted a Japanese‘.-minelay-er
about 2.1500 yards oﬁitheir bow.
The skipper ordered. an§~emergenc:y
dive and the sub rplnnged down-
ward. .""§You "open -the emergency
ballasts, .the ‘ocean iﬂoods in and
ym1;;go.;id.own'lilce av'rock’,’, Demeter
explains. * “We .-.got down 150 t feet
before-the first charge" caught us,
springing leaks in the ‘lines and
sct:‘tilrgg'u.;rp;.‘.air.. and oili This was
the worst fthing that could "have
happenédl outside of ' being. crushed
by the charges, because when the
Japs saw the oil on the water they
knew right where we were.
“They kept pounding us and

drove us to bottom in 1400 feet of
water. We lay there for 72 hours
while the Japs charged us every
hour on the hour with such pre-
cision that you could have set
your watch by the charges. By
the end of the third day, the depth
charges had stopped coming and
our oxygen was nearly gone; so
the Skipper decided to surface and
make a break for it. This we
did and made good our escape.
I was never so glad to get out of a
place in all my life!”

It was just sixty" days from the

liine the l-‘u;,{f<:r put out from Dar-

win on the first patrol in her re-

turn t:- port. While on patrol, the

»Puj]'e'r and her crcxv had  re-

ported lost three times and dur-
ing the three long‘ days at the
bot‘.,oi'n of the strait, it must have
seemed that the report could only
come true. But. dodging death
soon .became cornmo~nplace to
It was not long until
the Puffer was again out on pa-
trol, prowling for Jap transports
and warships.

The sou-b’s next assignvment was
to pick up some ﬁyers shot down
in a raid. on iS3:‘J'el'a~buju, Java. They
were, however, unable to reach
the men, but the -daring of the
exploit is no less common-dable for
its 1'ail~ure. Soeralboja lies at the
end of a narrow, shallow channel
eighty or so miles long. For most
of the way the channel is only
twelve fathoms deep (72 feet)

which is so-ant water in which to

maneuver a submarine. To the
danger of -detection by surface
craft was added the very probable
danger of -mines. Yet, the Puffer
managed to burrow sixty miles up
the channel and boldly remained
in the enemy-held harbor for two
days and nights. On the second
night, when the ﬂyers had still not
appeared, they began the long,
tedious trip out. Figuring that the
danger from surface craft was less
than that from mines and that
they could make better time on
the surface, they started out that
‘way. Before they had gone far,‘
they ran into a Jap convoy of
three ships, sank one in less than
a minute, and ran a successful race
to the open seaxwith‘ the other two.‘

Al: Boston A. A. Indoor Meet

By A1‘ Roth

Mentor Carl Olson and his band of undcrtrained tmcksters made their first start of 1946

indoor ‘season an auspicious occasion.

The Olson thincladstaccepted their invitation to the Bos-

iton ‘A:A. meet last Sa,turclay* evening in ﬁne -fashion by gainingisecond place in their heat in the‘
On'e—Mile Relay and placing Herb Douglas in a fast ﬁeld of 50-yard dashers.

Nothing would ‘please Doc Carlson and his lads more than to have
the presence of “Dodo” Canterna on the Stjadium floor for Wednes-
day night's fracas with the sharpshooters riibm West Virginia. The
former ‘Pitt star, who broke all previous Stadium records scoring
37 points against West1ni.n.ster’;¢ ' ‘ ’
Titans during the 19%-45 season,
is now hitting the hoop t‘r,~.r Uncle
Siimﬂs boys in the European the-
atre. _ N

The Freeport Flash at-present is
stationed at the Furs;tei1teldb2.‘ucl;,- ,
Airﬁeld ‘in Germany. ‘ . An article’ .
from‘ that Posts newspaper states
that Canterna holdsdown a guard 
position with a ;,=;roup of casuals’
from his outﬁt. “Dodo” has been
a sparkplug all season long, and
in a recent encounter with the E a
company of the 47th Infantry,
Canterna led his team to a 47-20
win over the foot soldiers. Scor-
ing 114 "points on three field goals
and«eight free throws. Canterna
lfielpéd turn a closely-contested
battle ‘into’ an almost near rout.
His accurate shooting and play-
making ability has proved a valu-
able asset during the entire sea-
son.

At present it is doubtful that
“Dodo” will receive an immediate
discharge; although it is expected
that he will be around at the start
of the.1946—47 season. CAanterna’s
excellent condition should not be

st‘et‘e,,West Virginia, Penn State,
arid”‘thé’rest"of ’em would do well
to" ‘sit up and take notice.

   

The Panther thinclads who have
been laboring under trying condi-
tions in their poorly lit, unheated,
furrow surfaced track house pulled
a surprising stint by measuring so
favorably against such wcll-sea-
soned opposition.

Douglas proved to be the lone
ccllegian entered in the short
s.print as he 'pla.ced :3 comfortable
third to such veteran performerrs
as Ed. Conwell of the Shore A._.C.
and Tom Carey entered by the
"Pioneer A.C. of New York City.
Both men are ex~co11-Gaze
pions-. The event \\'a.:-‘ marred by

ch am -

‘ seven starts and recalls but Doug-

las was not an offender on any of
these occasions. Conwe1l’s win-
ning time was clocked at :05.4.

In the one-mile relay event, the
Panther quartet consisting of Tom-
my Carr, leadoﬁ man who passed
the baton to Ed. Sudzina, followed

_. by Herb Douglas, and anchor-
’ man Clarence Doak. In their heat,

the Pittites were drawn against
N. Y. U. who are reputed to have
one of the ace mile relay outﬁts
in the nation. The local four

    

placed second to the superior
squad who stopped the clock at
3:27 minutes, which proved to be
the ﬁnest effort in that event that
night. The‘ Olsonmen pulled
through with a time of 3:33. The
Pitt‘ time was exceeded only by
Harvard Univ. who copped their
"section with a 3:32, a second bet-
ter than the Blue and Gold.

The Panther spiked stars will
continue workouts in anticipation
of an invitation to the New York
A.A. invitational festivities this
Saturday eve at Madison Square
Garden. The locals will repeat
their entries as of the Boston meet.

‘What s In A Name

A point of great confusion and
frequent amusement to novices at
Pitt is the preponderance of names
that would suggest qualities that
are not always descriptive of their
Owners, Take Drs. Boer and Dull
for instance. What an unfortu-
nate circumstance that they are
besought each new scmcstel‘ With
worn-out puns on their names.
Let it be said right now that there
is nothing new that can be dream-
ed up in the clc-‘.-ver remarks de-
partment on Drs. Boer and Dull.

To win the award, Mr. Bassler

Mr. Bassler’s sentence read: “We

news about free tests and new x-ray

As a means of locating possibly one
and a half million undetected cases of

I tuberculosis, the U . S.’ Piiblic Health
Service plans to offer chest x-ray tests
to nearly every American during the
next five years. This survey is made
possible through the use of new equip-
ment which produces chest x-rays on
small ﬁlm, thus permitting mass exami-

The development of the new ﬁlm and
the special ﬂuoroscopic screen was not
accomplished overnight. Organic chem-
ists, physical chemists, physicists, and
other technically trained men were re-
quired to make exhaustive studies be-
fore the problem was solved. Special
sensitizers had to be found. Phosphors
and activators had to be formulated for
the screen. Both screen and ﬁlm had to
be of ultra-ﬁne grain, and the spectral
emission of the screen had to be adjusted
to the spectral sensitivity of the ﬁlm.

Men of Du Pont are proud of their
part in the development of this new aid

efforts helped to contribute a new bene-

Dr. Peter Gray

Acts As Head :
Of Departnleiit

Dr. Peter Gray, a professor and V

director of research in biology,
was recently appointed acting‘
head of the department. '

Born“ in London in 1903, ‘Dr.’
Gray received hisldegrees at the
University of London. After lec-
turing at various schools through-
out the Bitish: Isles, he came to
the United States in 1937 1:as a
Traveling Fellow of the Rocke-
feller Foundation. Dr. Gray’s
interests have ibene diversiﬁed
and extend into the ﬁeld of ﬁne
arts, including actual work in
metalcrafts, wood carving, and
booklbinding. Last year he _-pre;
sented a 15-minute news com-
mentary nightly over Station

During the was, Dr. Gray was
almost wholly occupied with “re-
search in the ﬁeld of" biology for
the Office of Scientiﬁc «Research
