Angry sorority women stormed
last night’s Student Government
Board meeting, demanding
improved campus security in
response to the sexual assault of
a Kappa Kappa Gamma sister.

“As you know, we’ve had a
sister who was attacked in Forbes
Quad,” said Mary Nugent of
Kappa Kappa Gamma. “We have
attempted to get in touch with
President I]. Dennis] O’Connor,
and he hasn’t accepted our calls.
We’ve had parents call, and he
hasn’t accepted their calls.”

Concerned students rapidly
fired questions at Public Safety

campus police Sgt. Charles Grier,

William Harmon and the Student

“Forbes Quad is supposed to
be one of the safest places,” a
female student said. “Isn’t that
the headquarters for our campus
police? It’s really hard to have
faith in this campus when some
girl gets attacked near the
headquarters. It makes me so
upset. I don’t even want to leave
my house anymore, it’s so
frightening.” A _ l

A female student was sexually
assaulted at gunpoint Nov. 5,
when a unknown assailant forced

her to leave Forbes Quad, where “

she had been studying around
midnight, and go to Mazeroski
Field. ' I

Students repeatedly
complained that there aren’t
enough campus police officers:
“I hardly see them. Public safety
is ignored at this school.” '

Two_—time Pulitzer Prize-

advice to unpublished authors is,

He pointed out examples of the
Eurocentric influence in education and in
textbooks, among them Shakespeare, Van

“It is essential that African people claim
their own space,” Asante said. _

If the African community were to set up
its own cultural communities (such as

Chinatown), people‘ will react by calling ‘

them separatists, Asante said.

Asante believes thatAfricans must accept a

“The ripping of Africans from their
continent was the first violence Europeans

did to Africans. The second violence

happened in the middle passage on the

crocodiles rather than have them grow up
in slavery. And the third violence was

The aim of this article is to
familiarize you with some of the
services available at Student
Health and to assist you in making
the best use of these services.

Student Health is staffed by
five full-time physicians, two full-
time clinical nurse practitioners
and 10 full-time nurses. The staff
also includes two “in-house"
consulting dermatologists and
one sports—medicinc specialist.
We also have four gynecologists
working part-time in the evenings,
as well as an additional part-time
clinical nurse practitioner and
several part-time nurses.

There are over 250 appointment
slots each week with full-time
physicians, over 50 appointment
slots with the dermatologists and
over 20 appointments with the
sports-medicine physician. There
are 240 appointment slots
available each week for
gynecology and 137 appointment
slots for allergy patients.

Appointments may be made
over the phone (648-1250) or in

 

With FRANKLIN

Appointments are scheduled
between 9 am. to 9 p.m. Walk-in
patients who want to be seen by
a physician or clinical nurse
practitioner must first be seen by
a nurse in triage.

The purpose of this step is to
most expeditiously assign the
patient to the appropriate

Mailer said he hears
“discouraging words” all
over America. America is
becoming too corporate,
now that “we now put much
more into marketing
products than into making
them.”

“The problem with
America today is that the
nature of work is getting
more bland and
generalized,” Mailer said.
“You very often go into a
bookstore, which is usually
part of a bookstore chain,
and you encounter a young
clerk who would rather
work at the Gap."

Mailer even told his wife
that he was going to suggest
Warren Beatty run for

Pitt researchers find current y pm‘ Beta Kappa more than grades“

head injury treatment can
worsen patient’s condition A

By Jackie Estkowski
Sta_ﬁ"W'r1'ter

Current treatment methods for
severe head injuries can worsen
the effect of the impact and
possibly cause death, Pitt
researchers have discovered.

The National Institutes of
Health has awarded the Medical
Center more than $1 million to
study head-injury treatment.

Traumatic head injury is the
most common cause of death for
people between the ages of 14
and 25, and about two million
Americans sustain head injuries
each year.

Many physicians have head
injury victims breathe rapidly to
reduce the swelling, but
hyperventilation can actually
worsen the injury because it
reduces blood flow to the brain,
said Dr. Donald Marion, director

of Pitt Medical Center’s Head
Injury Research.

Marion said no progress in the
treatment ofsevere head injuries
has been made in the past 10
years.

“Head injury accounts for more
life lost than cancer,” he said.
Most head-injury deaths are
caused by motor vehicle
accidents, falls and assaults.

' Pitt is the only center in the
region and one of only 12 in the
country to receive NIH funding.
The center at Pitt treats about 40
to S0 severe head-injury patients
a year.

“Our goals are to support the
development of head injury
research and to provide a clinical
study of hypothermia or cooling
of severe head injury patients,”
Marion said.

It takes more than good grades to become a
member of Phi Beta Kappa.

Although the national liberal—arts honor society
requires a 5.5 quality—point average, “achievement
of depth and breadth in liberal arts” is also
required, said economics Professor llerbert
Chesler, the president of Pitt’s Phi Beta Kappa
chapter.

Last April approximately/10 Pitt seniors were
invited to become members of Phi Beta Kappa.
They are now lifetime members of the chapter,
which is not only known for its prestige but also
“as a symbol of a high degree of literacy and
concern with the quality of culture in society,”
Chesler said.

The “depth” includes 15 credits in three liberal-
arts divisions: natural science, humanities and
social sciences. The credits are arranged in a 9-
3-5 pattern. For example, if a student has nine

credits in psychology, three in math, and three
in chemistry, then his or her natural-science

requirement has been filled. The 9-5-3 pattern .

can apply to any courses in the three liberal—arts
divisions.

The “breadth” includes two years of foreign
language and culture at a college level. Four
years offoreign language at a high school level
is also accepted. Finally, three credits each in
two additional departments are needed for
acceptance into Phi Beta Kappa.

Phi Beta Kappa was founded in 1776 at
William and Mary College. The total alumni
since 1776 is 582,687 members, ofwhich 430,000
are living. =

Phi Beta Kappa was founded at the University
of Pittsburgh in 1953. Since 1988, there have
been 92 members inducted into the society.

“What Phi Beta Kappa looks for is a liberally
educated person,” Chesler said. He encourages
students to present their credentials to Phi Beta
Kappa for an invitation to become a member.

 Safety

THE PI'IT NEWS, Wednesday, November 13, 1991

 

Continued from page 1

Pam Price of KKG asked
Brennan for the exact number of
campus police officers.

Brennan said the university
employs about 100 police officers
and security guards combined,
the fourth largest police force in
Allegheny County. He cited Pitt’s
“dedication to campus safety.
There’s always an officer assigned

‘to every area of this campus
I ‘ , everyhouroftheday.Nowwhere
‘ that officer is at a particular time,

I can’t tell you.”

A Campus police respond quickly
to calls, he said. “There’s always
somebody available within a
matter ‘of minutes. This area of
Oakland is extremely well
policed.”

The students demanded
immediate solutions to the
problem of inadequate campus

safety, and Brennan and SGB
members cited Crime Stop and
the distribution of police whistles
on campus as preventative
measures.

Brennan advised students to
use campus whistles to ward off
attackers, but students said the
whistles were ineffective.

“The only thing we can depend
on, aside from our police officers,

is you. God, listen! Ifyou hearthe .

whistle, call us! And encourage
your friends who take the whistles
out on the corner and blow them
not to do that,” Brenﬁan said.
‘But SGB member Brock
Hamula’s comment that the
whistles are being used — by
students playing with them in the
Towers lobby — drew loud
applause.
Brennan disagreed that the
whistles are worthless; “If one

person is not a victim of a crime
because of this whistle, it’s worth
it.”

SGB President Brent Saunders

addressed student concerns that

O’Connor is insensitive to safety
on campus. The first meeting of
a task force on public safety will
be held today, Saunders said.
Students said they need to
know more about campus crimes
and asked Brennan why crime
reports aren't publicized. “It’s our
right for us to know what
happens,” a KKG sister said.
Although police flyers
describing the sexual assault were

distributed on campus, some.

students claimed they hadn’t seen

,the reports.

Students asked that campus
police reports be open to the
public, so they wouldn’t have to
rely on secondhand information.

Rumors circulated this week
about sexual assaults occurring
on campus over the weekend,
but these reports were denied by
city and campus police.

An improved shuttle system
was proposed as a way to
decrease campus crime.

Saunders described the existing
campus shuttle system as “kind
of crazy” with “shuttIes running
everywhere” after students
explained that they often couldn’t
get rides.

“Evensomething as simple as
waiting for the shuttle to come,
something could happen then. I
have waited 15 minutes for one
of those shuttles to come, and
within that time I could have
been dragged into a field and
raped,” a student said.

“The whole shuttle system is a
problem,” Saunders agreed.

Brennan. “Is this place 100 percent
safe? Unfortunately no place in
America is 100 percent safe. It’s
as safe as we want to make it,”
Brennan said. “And notice I Said
the word ‘we.’ And that means us
wor-king jointly together —
because we need your help. And
that's why I’m here. I'm asking
for your help.”

Brennan also recognized the
limits of the public safety
department.

“Unfortunately we can’t be
everywhere at once. Can there
be another crime on campus?
Certainly there can 
know unless you tell me” about
people who don’t belong in an
area, he said.

Pitt students also have not
participated in campus safety
events, Saunders said. “It’s
unfortunate that such a horrible
thing had to happen to get people
to come and voice their opinions.”

Bender added the attendance
at the meeting was “the most I’ve
seen in a long time. We usually
have trouble evenlfilling up that
room.” A

Brennan said he tried to bring
South Oakland students together
to talk about safety and the effort
was unsuccessful.

Students also haven’t shown
an interest in the SGB public-
safety committee, according to
Saunders.

“Things aren’t going to happen
overnight but things will happen
quicker if we get more student
involvement,” SGB member—elect
Bryan Bender said. ‘ ‘

“We are willing to make the
Change. We just need the input
and the ideas to do it,” Saunders
said. '

"Harmon suggested better off-
campus housing for students as a
solution to the problem.

SGB member and president-
elect Gil Golden put it bluntly:

. “We live in a slum.” Golden called

Oakland a “scum-filled pit hole”
and demanded that the university
start an escort service to protect
students from attacks.

process to turn the African people into slaves.”

Asante urged members Of the black community to implement
African culture into everything they do.

“There is nothing that is not culturally constructive. Everything
you wear, read and do comes from a certain culture.

“When you examine the system Offalsification and fabrication,
you will see that it exists in the imagination Of Europeans and
Clarencized [Clarence ThOmas—like] ‘black people,” Asante
said.

Asante’s speech was preceded by a libation ceremony,
“which calls for all the black people to come together in unity.”
The ceremony invoked Malcolm X, Jesse Jackson and Harriet
Tubman, among other black leaders, to join the audience in
unification of the black community.

The African Drum and Dance Ensemble and the Mojah
(Swahili for “unity”) Dance Company performed and sang
African songs as well.

Asante is the professor and chairperson of the department of
African-American studies at Temple University. He is the
author Of 30 books, one of which includes his bestseller
Afrocentricity. Asante’s work on African culture and philosophy
has appeared in many national publications, including Newsweek
and the New York Times. '

students, so that we, the students,
can get back to basics — an
education,” Golden said.

As well students are often
unsure ifthey should call campus
or city police. According to
Brennan, the two work closely
together.

“We’re concerned about the
crimes that happen Off Our
jurisdiction,” Brennan said. “I have
a system set up with Pittsburgh
police,-where every day we go
down there and review all the
reports that go into the Pittsburgh
police — so I can pull out those
reports that may have involved
Our students Or may have an
impact On our students.”

Crime Stop, a communication
network between public safety
and dorm residents, was
implemented last year “as a
tremendous effort from [SGB] as
well as student affairs and some
people in public safety,” Brennan
said.

“From my experience I’ve seen
that crime watch/crime stop
programs wOrk,” Brennan said.
“In Philadelphia, people on a

crime watch helped catch a rape
suspect. It does work. I urge you
to become a part of it.”

Brennan said he sees doors
and windows unlocked when he
drives Off campus in the early
morning.

“Crime is opportunity. If you
give someone the opportunity,
you'd better believe they’re going
to take it.” he said.

“Crime Stop is an example of
what students can do when they
sit down and say we need
something and this is our idea,"
Saunders said. Students need to
form a committee and “take it to
the administration,” he said. \—

Mark Rosen, chair of the SGB
public safety committee, said he
surveyed students in the Towers
who ranked overall campus safety
5.91 On a scale Of 1 to 10.

Student concerns included an
escort service, abetter shuttle
service, more police and security
and better self defense programs.

SGB members also passed Out

Bender said the woman

In an interview after the

‘Some of the best things in life are free. Who
said -that first? I’m not really all that sure, but I
do know that it is true.

The other day while I was supposed to be
studying my Greek history, I was thinking

I ‘(something I have done a lot of in the past).

.What are the best things in life?

Now it isn’t necessarily the new bike your
parents bought for you on your 12th birthday,
and ‘it isn’t necessarily a solid piece of mer-
chandise. ‘

It’s something that makes you feel good. It’s
something that makes your day.

It’s something that excites you, and it’s some-
thing that makes you jump up and say, “This is

. the best!”

I've compiled a small list of some of life’s finer
pleasures.

Maybe you'll agree, and then again maybe
you won’t. But I’m sure you’ve either heard or
witnessed some of these gems, or you might
have discovered some of your own.

_ -Best song to listen to at 3 a.m. when you
can't sleep or you’re in your car driving: “Sul-
tans of Swing” by Dire Straits.

'-Best food: any food eaten after 2 a.m. that

complements a night of drinking.
' 0 Best late-night (or early morning — however
you say it) television show: “Trump Card.” It’s
hosted by Jimmy Cefalo, for you sports buffs,
and it's a tough game show, so you might learn
something for once at 3:30 a.m.

0 Best late-night television show theme song:
the beginning of “Hawaii Five-0.” It’s great, and

 

everybody knows the words.

-Best beer: one that is free. But everyone
knows that already.

-Best chuckle: when some schmuck takes
the elevator in the William Pitt Union from the
main floor to the first floor. Get some exercise,
for God's sake.

-Best theft of services: receiving HBO,
Cinemax, Showtime and Encore over your
cable system, even when you haven't subscribed
to it. (I’m not saying this is happening in my
apartment, but I’m not saying it isn’t, either.)

-Best revenge: finding out the girl you made
yourself crazy over all though high school and
got dumped by got pregnant, dropped out of
high school and is living with her unemployed,
longhaired, will-never—make—it musician boy-
friend in a single room apartment without any
assistance from her parents, who loved you and
have since disowned her. Lovely news.

0 Best time to go to church: Saturday evening
with your older brother, so you can leave early
and your parents will never know. The Catholics
should know what I mean.

0 Best three things to have at your disposal: a

refrigerator full of food, a car with a full tank of
gas and a clean, fully equipped bathroom — all
things you can have if you go home for a
weekend. The third one is most appreciated.

-Best college major to get you a job: I don't
know. A A

-Best college major guaranteed not to get
you at job: psychology. The only problem with
this one is it isn’t one of the best things in life
that’s free. ‘

-Best actress of all time, who deserves an
Oscar but will_never get one: Tori Wells. You
might have to look into this one or ask Ernie and
Butcher. -

0 Best state to make a joke about: Newjersey.

0 Best city to make a joke about: San Francisco.

0 Best movie to tell your friend with a VCR to
rent so it's free for you: Caligula. Ask questions’
later. I ‘

0 Best underage feeling: not being ID-ed at a
bar and/or liquor store

-Best overall general feeling; reaching into a
pair of jeans you haven’t worn in some time and
finding a dollar bill. Five bucks is better. Ten
bucks is even better than that, and 20 bucks,
which is almost unheard of, is orgasmic.

Well, I hope you have enjoyed my brief list.
Like I said before, you may have experienced
one of these, or you may have some of your
own. . ’

But always remember:
Some of the best things in life are free.

Arms cuts to satisfyliberals completely irrational

  Gary
Houston

Times are changing. Five years
ago, who would have thought that
the Soviet Union would fall apart?
Not me. The Wall has fallen, and
Germany is once again reunited.

The United States has fought a
well-justified war against a dictator
with grand ambitions and scored
one of the biggest military victories
in history. It has finally put to rest

, the Vietnam syndrome.

And for the biggest surprise
George Bush announces massive
unilateral cuts in U.S. strategic and
tactical nuclear forces. Guess who
we have to thank for much of this?

Ronald Reagan. Oh, the liberals
will pout and, as usual, put on their
reality-blinders, but the facts can-
not be refuted.

When Ronald Reagan came into
office in 1980, this country's armed
forces were in sad shape due to the
neglect ofjimmy Carter. The Soviet
Union enjoyed tremendous ad-
vantages in conventional and
nuclear arms thanks to typical
Democratic ignorance of anything
not related to whatever pet cause
the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People,
the National Organization for
Women or the AFL-CIO was cur-
rently shouting about. So here
comes. Ronnie, and he says,
“Waitarninutel If we continue on
this route, the only thing we’ll have

left to defend ourselves with will
be the Coast Guard.”

Reagan then proceeded to em-
bark on a massive military buildup.
Now Soviet leaders have always
had a healthy respect for the U.S.
military. ' (Vietnam doesn’t_ count
because we never lost a single
battle. Check the facts. That war
was lost politically.) So when
Reagan gave the military a much-
needed shot in the arm, it was
pretty much over for any Soviet
military ambitions. The buildup,
combined with dire economic woes
in the U.S.S.R, brought to power

men like Gorbachev, who could _

see the writing on the wall. All the
kudos to Bush and Reagan.

It was Republican action that
permitted George Bush to drasti-

cally downsize our nuclear arse-
nal. I am usually quite hawkish in
my thinking when it comes to the
military, but even I can see that
there is no need for many of the
weapons that are going to be taken
out of service. Bush made his de-
cision’ based on the assumption
that Gorbachev would match U.S.

efforts, which he has. So the world

will be shy of thousands of nuclear
warheads, and one can only say,
“Good riddance!” Being as pre-
dictablelas they are, the Democrats
are now demanding massive cuts
in the military budget. They have_
their minds on some imaginary pot
of gold called the “peace dividend.”
The last thing this country needs
is to waste billions on social pro-
grams that would turn this country
into some overtaxed welfare state.
Any and all extra money should go
toward reducing the budget deﬁ-
cit. Recent Democratic attempts to
render the U.S. military impotent
and undersized sure won’t help

_ them in the eyes of the mainstream

voters.

Bush’s nuclear—arms cuts are just
the latest‘ chapter in his outstand-
ing foreign-policy record. And for
those who criticize him for a sup-
posedwdisdain of domestic issues,
please remember that it is the
Congress that passes legislation and
that it has been controlled by
Democrats for most of the past 25
years. I sincerely hope that George
Bush receives another four years in
office because the prospect of a
Democrat is too scary to think

Racism aﬁects all facets of aniversity and society  

An interesting development occurred during
my efforts to support a column on racism. I had
a hard time coming up with statistics. News-
papers, magazines and books all offered little in
terms of hard facts on the existence of racism in
society or on campus today. But does that mean
that racism is a myth? Hardly.

If anything it helps to show the indifference
people have to the subject. Is it truly possible
to document every single race—relatedincident?
Every assault, every harassment, every denied
opportunity? With hiring based on pleasing the
government and impersonal laws, the exist-
ence of numbers bears little toward the insti-
tution of discrimination. .

So instead of rebuking what I perceive a
causes, I’m forced to dance’ circles around my
lack of mathematical information. The liberal
press denounces vehemently the conservative
stance on civil rights, yet it also plays the role’
of racist, as the press declares the mundanity of
petty discriminations and buries it.

Joe R. Feagin comments on “a general per-
ception among white journalists and white
social scientists that racism is all but gone —
except for a few bigots.” Thus the concept that
something does not exist unless it can be

Joe Babinsack I

proven by facts. And that is, I'm sure, the reason
behind Feagin’s follow—up, which calls such
actions a “cover-up.”

. ’ So where can this racism be found? Let’s look

at the top. Bush obviously adheres to the “if you
can’? show me racism, it doesn't exist” camp.
Note_ his reactions to the existence of the

homeless and the unemployed. As Manning _

Marable claims, any attempt to make even “the
slightest difference” with affirmative action is
denounced as unnecessary, and attempts
“making up for past injustices are labeled as
reverse discrimination.”

The new, silencing fervor of racism was very
apparent to me last year on campus. The Black
Action Society tried its best to change the way
the university was operating. Many of these
effects did not and would not affect the average
white student, but these and those which could
have beneficial aspects were soundly denounced
by any white person I spoke with. Considering
the recent inanities of JD. O’Connor, I’m glad
some people had the sense to make some

waves. It’s too bad no one else on campus has
the guts to say anything controversial.
Whitesupremacy does exist. The fact is that
whites run the major banks, corporations and
the government in this so—called democracy.
Remember that power corrupts. And in a society
run by whites, anyone white has little to com-
plain about, except for minorities.Yet every

year thiscountry loses ground to others in its

ability to run itself. We are saddled with tre-
mendous debts; the government ignores it like
it ignores civil rights. The discrimination goes
on and on. -

Meanwhile the minorities, who hold the
potential of new blood, are denied complete
infusion into this stagnating, decrepit society.
What kind of pride can be taken by an innate
ability in whites to mismanage and corrupt,
keeping out new sources of insight and denying

rightfulattainment of positions just so someone’s ,

stupid relative can hold consistently mean-
ingless job? The racist claim that society is dying
because of the intermingling of races is the
stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.

Nuclear weapons necessaryto prevent war

Nuclear weapons are good.

By saying this I am not advocating
the use of nuclear weapons. I am‘
only stating that their existence
serves a useful purpose in the
international system. I fear a nuclear
war as much as anyone, but I
believe such a war is improbable if
the proliferation of weapons is‘
properly managed. That is the key
to the successful role of nuclear
weapons.

Since the end of World War II,
we have seen the emergence,
progression and probably the end
of the Cold War. This war pitted the
United States and the Soviet Union,
the world's two great nuclear
powers, against each other. Each
nation had troops and nuclear
weapons stationed in Europe for
this period of about 45 years. The
prospects, for war looked much
greater during this time than they
did during the periods before the
two world wars, but did they fight

this time? No.

Ed Kichline

This lack of fighting helps to
demonstrate the deterrent power
of nuclear weapons. Ever since the
United States bombed Hiroshima
and Nagasaki, the world has been
aware of the destruction _involved
with nuclear arms. Nations have
been trying to make their weapons
more effective and to build as
many as possible. This continued
development of the bomb and the
mass production of the weapons
ensures that a nuclear launch by
one country will cause the other to
react by launching its own missiles.
This idea of mutually assured de-
stru ction keeps the nu clear powers
from using their arsenals.

In order for the nuclear world to
remain safe, nuclear capability must
only be possessed by those coun-
tries who can hold it responsibly.
The United States at-i_d the Soviet

Union have proven their responsi-
bility with the non-use of arms, but
the sharing of technology and
knowledge is another question. A
country like Iraq should not be
trusted with the bomb, yet through
the help of both superpowers, Iraq
was close to having a nuclear
weapon. This prospect would make
the Middle East more of a trouble
spot than it already is.

Israel's ‘nuclear capability is de-
scribed by Pulitzer Prize—winning
author Seymour Hersh in his new
book, The Samson Option. Hersh
condemns the U.S. for allowing
Israel to develop the bomb while
keeping the other states in the
Middle East from doing the same.
He believes this situation creates
great instability, as the Arab nations
live in fear of a nuclear Israel.

If Israel did not have the bomb,
it would be forced to defend itself
with its conventional weapons,
which are superior to its neighbors’.
Even so, the Arab nations have

shown their willingness to test the
Israeli army. But if the Arab nations
perceive an Israeli nuclear threat,
they will be less inclined to fight
out of fear of destruction. Because
Israel is a nation which ‘can be
trusted with the bomb, this uneven
situation can work in the Middle
East. ‘ _
There are many people in the
world who seek the elimination of
all nuclear weapons, mostly be-
cause of the fear of their killing
power. This is a legitimate concern,
as is the problem with the billions
of dollars spent to build arms.
However these issues are out-
weighed by the positive effects of
nuclear weapons. The more you’
fear the repercussions of your ac-
tions, the less likely you will be to
act. The fear of destruction in a
nuclear world keeps nations
peaceful.

Panthers pulverize Villanova 3-0 in powerful show Tuesday night

The Pitt basketball team plays
its second and final exhibition
game tonight, when Marathon
Oil comes to Fitzgerald Field
House.

Pittsburgh is the eighth stop on
Marathon’s Big East tour.

After tonight’s contest, the team
will ﬁnish its exhibition schedule
in Miami on Thursday.

Pitt will open its regular season
by hosting Manhattan in the
Preseason National Invitation
Tournament on Nov. 20.

Normally, an exhibition team
like Marathon is good for a light
challenge but eventually is routed
by the home team, like the
Canadian team was last
Wednesday in the Panthers’ first
game.

But this team is different.

First, Marathon Oil has actually
beaten a Big East team, and it has
come close to beating others.
Marathon overran Providence last
week, 108-93.

Since then they have lost to
Villanova by just six points and to
Seton Hall by one, 87-86,

compiling a 1-5 record thus far.

Their most recent game before
last night was a 97-92 overtime
defeat at the hands of St. John’s.
The Marathon team was at
Syracuse last night.

Their roster features several
players who faced Pitt last year,
when the Panthers beat Marathon
Oil 75-70.

Todd May, from Pikeville
College in Kentucky, is one such
player. -

The 6-foot, 9-inch May is college
basketball’s all-time leading scorer
and a smooth shooter.

He collected 22 points and 14
rebounds in a loss to Boston
College and 29 points and 14
boards at St. John’s.

The rest of the roster has big-
time, college—hoops name
recognition as well. Virginia guard
Richard Morgan, a veteran of the
Cavs’ 1989 Sweet 16 team, and
former Michigan standout Eric
Turner comprise a solid
backcourt.

In Marathon’s victory over
Providence, the two combined
for 36 points and 11 assists while
making three of seven three-point

Using very efficient play, the
Pitt volleyball team ended its
regular season by soundly
defeating error-plagued West

Virginia 15-8, 15-2 and 15-9.

The Panthers were led by a
multitude of players. In all, seven
players had three kills or more.
Topping the list was sophomore
Ann. Marie Lucanie, 10 kills;
seniors Sue Zonneville and Linda
Zols, seven kills each; senior Dee
MacAulay, five kills; senior
Heather Hollands and first-year
player Chelsea Hemingway, four
kills each and senior Shelly
Seanor, three kills.

This offensive variety coupled
with setter Anne Marie Mernagh’s
consistent play helped the
Panthers roll to a 3-0 triumph.

In game one, Pitt darted out to
a 2-0 lead. Then the Lady
Mountaineers came back to take
five straight points, as the
momentum swayed. However it
shifted back to Pitt, as Lucanie
blistered several spikes that West
Virginia’s defense could not
return.

West Virginia, led by the
blocking of junior middle hitter
Wendy Mills, then took a slim
lead at 8-7. But Pitt again fought
back with the serving of Mernagh,
the blocking of MacAulay and
Zols and thehitting of Lucanie.
All three helped in scoring eight
straight points, as Pitt rallied to

win game one, 15-8.

Game one exemplified the
Panthers’ efficient play. Head
coach Sue Woodstra said that this
kind of play has marked the
team’s season.

“We are playing really efficiently
and consistently right now,”
Woodstra said.

More efficient play in game
two led to a whitewashing of the
Lady Mountaineers. Dashing to a
12-1 lead, the Panthers never
looked back. MacAulay anchored
Pitt’s offense with an impressive
.417 kill percentage. Senior
Heather Hollands contributed
several key offspeed shots in Pitt’s-
15-2 win.

West Virginia found several
bright spots within its losing effort.
Junior Jen McCuen had six kills
and an attack percentage of .667,
while senior Cathy Folger
contributed nine kills and
constantly provided ample
blocking and serving. ' V
‘ In game three, Pitt got on track
from the very beginning. On the
first serve a perfect set from
Mernagh led to‘ a thunderous

. spike from Lucanie. That spike

set the tone for the entire game.
After West Virginia fought back
to a 4-4 tie, Woodstra started to
insert a couple first—year players
into the Panther lineup. Carrie
Thornton, Tracy Komar, Melanie
Gustafson and Hemingway all
received quality playing time.
The play of middle hitter
Gustafson and outside hitter

Hemingway sparked the Panthers
in the middle of a tightly played
third game. They made the most
of their chance to play and lifted
Pitt to a 15-9 win.

Woodstra was happy to have

the younger, inexperienced
players come through in that kind
of game.
V “The younger players are
getting quality playing time and
are learning to play efficiently,”
Woodstra said.

These first-year players are the
future for Pitt volleyball. Woodstra
has been slowly working them in
when she can, and they are
definitely holding their own on
the court. That is a positive sign
for a team that loses six seniors
after this season.

With this win the Panthers look
forward to the Big East
Tournament. “We are working
on different plays [for the Big
East tourney], and we are trying
to stay sharp,” Woodstra said.
“We are now playing like a Top
20 team.”

Speaking of the Top 20, Pitt re-
entered the ranks at No. 20. It has
been almost two months since
the Panthers have been counted
in the nation’s elite.

Woodstra pointed out that it
was a determined Pitt volleyball
team that fought back from a
sluggish start.

“The girls fought hard to come
back and earn the respect they
thought they had lost,” Woodstra
said.

Dante Calabria is the best
high—school basketball player
to come out of western
Pennsylvania in a long, long
time, but he won’t be staying
at home.

The Pittsburgh Press and the
Pittsburgh Post—Gazette
reported that Calabria will
announce his intention to
attend the University of North
Carolina and sign a letter of
intent during the NCAA’s early
signing period that begins
today.

The 6-foot, 5-inch swingman
from Blackhawk High School
was western Pennsylvania’s
most highly recruited player
in years. .

Pitt did make Calabria’s list
of final choices along with
North Carolina, Iowa and
Villanova, but after visiting the
Tar Heels’ campus in Chapel

decision.
He considered taking a ﬁnal

Hill, N.C., Calabria made his

Smith outduels Pitt’s Evans; gets
Blaze/ehozw/e’s Calozbrtafor ”Heels

visit to Notre Dame, but he
changed his mind because the
Irish had only started to recruit
him after John MacLeod w‘as
.named coach last spring.

“I decided to stay with the
people who were recruiting me
from the very beginning,” Calabria
told the Press.

"I thought that was only fair.
[The Tar Heels] have been
recruiting me since I played on
the 16—and-under AAU team in
San Diego one and a half years
ago. [North Carolina Coach] Dean
Smith has come up to see me five
times.”

Calabria was The Pittsburgh
Press’ Player of the Year last
season while leading Blackhawk
to a 30-1 record and its second
straight WPIAL Class "AAA
championship.

He averaged 27.3 points, 9.5
rebounds and three steals per
game and hit 47 percent (59 of

126) of his three-point attempts.
He was recruited as a shooting
guard by North Carolina.

The Tar Heels’ starter at that
spot, 6-4 Hubert Davis, is a senior.

Donald Williams, a 6-3 first-
year student; Brian Reese, a 6-
5 sophomore and Henrik Rodl,
a 6-7 junior will provide
competition to Calabria for
the starting job.

‘He should have no problem
adjusting to Carolina’s offense
since Blackhawk Coach John
Miller uses many of Smith's
plays.

Calabria will be eligible to
play as a first—year student.

He has a grade—point
average above 3.0 and has
already scored well above the
NCAA’s required minimum of
700 on the Scholastic Aptitude
Test.

Prior to Calabria’s verbal
commitment to North Carolina,
Pitt had already received a
commitment from another
player that plays Calabria’s
position.

Garrick Thomas, a 6-4
swingman out of Aldine High
School in suburban Houston,
Texas, announced his
intention to attend Pitt two
weeks ago.

THE PI'IT NEWS, Wednesday, November 13, 1991

Marathon

Continued from page 8
attempts.

The frontcourt has May, former
Butler star Chad Tucker and
former Iowa State center Phil
Kunz

Tucker is a solid offensive
player who can also shoot the
three—pointer.

If there is a glaring weakness
among the starters, it is post
defense.

Boston College’s Billy Curley
victimized Kunz and company
for 35 points and 20 rebounds in
the Eagles’ 85-75 win.

Seton Hall’s 7-2 Luther Wright
had 14 points and seven boards
in 19 minutes of action against
Marathon.

Pitt’s Darren Morningstar had
19 points against Canada and
could be in for another big night
tonight.

Two former Auburn players,
Zane Arnold and John Caylor,
will be seeing their first action for
Marathon Oil tonight.

They are roster replacements
for Peter Gabriele and Barry
Munger. ~

This game will provide a stiffer
test for Pitt than the weak
Canadian team which succumbed
to physical play and tough
rebounding work.

Pitt grabbed nearly half of its 43
rebounds against the Canadians
on the offensive glass.

This next opponent has also
been struggling on the boards.
But where Canada’s starting gmard
combination of Eli Pasquale and
Al Kristmanson shot 5-13 from
the floor, Morgan and Turner

provide a real challenge to the
Pitt man—to—man defense.

One deﬁnite advantage, at least
on paper, is the Panthers’ superior
depth.

Then again,’_Marathon ran up
its 108 points against Providence
using just eight players. May and
Tucker are capable of playing 40
minutes a game.

Pitt should be able to test its '

pressing defense and transition
game tonight, for both teams are
comfortable with a baseline—to-
baseline game.

Only one Panther (Morningstar) .

saw over 21 minutes of playing
time against the Canadian team
last week, and this trend will no
doubt continue.

Chris McNeal played 20
minutes, but foul trouble limited
his effectiveness and he had only
four points.

The Panthers also attempted

16 three-point shots last
Wednesday, making five.
Marathon is a good three—point-
shooting team (10-16 versus
Providence’s 14-21) and will rely
heavily on a perimeter game.
Tonight’s game might also
provide Pitt with practice against
a zone defense, which left its

offense stagnant at times against

the Canadians.

The Panthers’ offense last week
consisted of layups, dunks and
three-pointers,

Medium-range jump shots were
not a big part of the scheme, and
Pitt will need to add them to its
offensive game in order to
succeed.

 

Jason Hillman/'1" he Pitt News

. Darren Morningstar (shown .against the Canadian National Teain) will look to have a big game tonight.

Staﬁ“ Writer

Excitement: The Steelers
actually won another game. Yes,
it was a dramatic win and a‘great
comeback, but remember the
Opponent. There are college
teams with tougher defenses than
the Cincinnati Bengals. A lot of
them.

Let’s get one thing straight: It is
going to take a minor miracle for
this team to make the playoffs.

Most likely this team needs to
win the rest of its games (or at
least five of six) to make the
playoffs. That is about as likely as
the perspective editor of 7776 Pitt
News figuring out the playoff
system in the NFL. The undefeated
Washington Redskins come to
Three Rivers Stadium this
weekend, and the 9-] Houston
Oilers come in the next week.
They also have to play at Houston
and have a Thanksgiving Day
game versus a solid Dallas
Cowboy team. The easy part of
the schedule was the past four
weeks, and the Steelers won only
One.

No, they should not give up
and worry about losing enough
games to get a high draft pick. A
wide receiver like Desmond

Howard or Carl Pickens could do ‘

wonders for an offense thatseems
to be coming together. So would
a blue chip offensive lineman to
take the place of the aging Tunch
Ilkin. (I am really going to miss

that name.) Still, beyond the
ethical considerations involved,
losing is a bad habit to get into
and a hard one to break. That is
a lesson the Steelers should have
learned very well by now.

What this team does need to do
is find out who can play. One guy
who is showing he can is the
major reason for the offensive
improvement: quarterback Neil
O’Donnell. He has changedthe
minds Ofsome ofhis worst critics
(myself included) with his play
since the second—half
performance against the Giants.
I-le has shown the ability to bring
the team from behind (something
Bubby Brister was not able to
do), and he finally got a win
against the Bengals. The request
by Brister’s agent to trade the
former starter has probably only
served to solidify O’Donnell’s
position. Coach Chuck Noll is
never happy with players rocking
the boat. _

The most important thing is
how the team responds to
O’Donnell. It seems to play harder
when he is on the field. The
Steelers seem to believe he can
bring the team back no matter
what happens. They used to
believe in Brister that way, but
not any more. Maybe becuase he
seems to have lost that endearing,
daredevil style trying to fit into
Joe Walton’s offense. It shouldn’t
‘matter who is on the field to the
other players, but it does.

Another player finally getting a

  3-'-—'STUDEN T
GVERN MEN T

 

Student Government Board

    

  Steelers Win comes too late to salvage lost seaso

chance is rookie receiver Ernie
Mills. He caught two passes
Sunday for 65 yards and a 35-
yard touchdown. This is only a
beginning, but at least the third-
round pick is getting a Chance —
more than second-rounder Jeff
Graham is getting. ‘

This team needs help at
receiver. Dwight Stone is having
a solid season, and Louis Lipps
has been showing that he can still
get it done. But Lipps is the only
consistent threat. Graham was
supposed to fill that gap, but he
held out and then missed some
time with injuries. It is time to see
what he can do.

Defensively, outside linebacker
Jerrol Williams is getting to play
a lot, but he needs to be out there
more. Whether he is better than
starter Brian Hinkle or not is
debatable, but there is no question
that Williams will be around a lot
longer and could become a much
better player. He and Greg Lloyd,
who is having an outstanding
season by the way, could develop
into a great pair ofbig-play outside
linebackers. Defensive end Kenny

Davidson and offensive tackle ’

Justin Strelczyk are other young
players who should be given
opportunities.

Actually, speaking of things that
should be done, I should say
something, I don't really totally
understand the NFL playoff
system either, and I would
probably be worried about myself
if I did.

to gather pilot data to see if hypothermia is
effective,” he said. “We hope to find a
treatment to improve the outcome of severe
