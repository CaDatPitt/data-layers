The objects of the Trainingcamps are

military instruction 1 in the ﬁeld under
olfioers, and with troops, of the Regular
Army. (2),To foster a. patriotic spirit and
spread among the citizens of the coun-
try some knowledge of .i,mi1itary history,
military policy, andLmi1Lary needs. (3)
To instill in fourori ﬁve Weeks of healthly
outdoor life-1.theL habits, of obedience,

are the I)t‘e.l"f;‘L"1\‘liSiteS of efficiency in
every business or profession, and to send
men back from the camps better pre-
pared toitakecare of themselves and of
others. ‘ ‘
There will be four senior Camps held

has been supplemented by business or
professional training. ‘ L

‘The finals. of the elimination tourna-
menit at the Tr-afford courts could out
be heldﬁlast Saturday onhiaccount of
bad weafher, but preliminary matches
brought out several" very good men.
The matches held Odurinlgé the l week

were hotly’ contested.. and some good
. playing was necessary in order to de-

cide just who was who. Couth and

Mohn are consideredthe pick of the

lot with McGrew"and Williams push-
ing them ‘rather hard. “ From these
four together with the old men,Burg-
win, Ebe, Maines, Myers‘ and Wilbert,

and three‘-‘others who showed up well,’
’l‘.ho-mas, Foster and V Spindler, the .

Varsity probably will be chosen. An-
other team. will also be selected to
play matches with local clubs while
the Varsity will play all collegiate
matches. -In this way new men will
be better developed for next year and
in case of ay accident‘ to a member
of the Varsity they will be in good
condition to replace him. ; .
The. ﬁrst .match of the season is
with Grove City and will likely be
played at the Trafford courts, as the
University and .P. A. A. courts are
not in conditionyet. , .
The fair ones will have achance to
