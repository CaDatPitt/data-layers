Of Time And Three
Rivers Is Theme

CF Senior Swan Song

By MELVIN nooow, BA,
and HERBERT RACKOFF, BS

There can be no progress if
there is no change.

And so we seniors can be ex-
cused for getting sentiinental,
looking back at the lfnivcrsity
as it was in 1.934, comparing‘ it
with the University as it is to-1
day. A lot of water has passed
under the bridge -since then; mud-
dy and clear.

Four long years ago, and it
seems onlyyesterday, there were
87 steps up which we climbed to
class. In fact, the leaf-bound
walks to Alumni Hall represent to
us a great milestone in our career
of the University.

Four long years ago, as we en- I
tered these great halls of learning,
picked up a Pitt News (free),
bought our ﬁrst Pitt Panther!
(10c), we had very little concept
of why we were here. And now,
four long years later, we are still
wondering.

Of School Life

‘We shall never forget that om-
inous day four long years ago,
when we read with trepidation the
news that Governor George Earle
(Pennsylvania’s great liberal Gov-
ernor), was about to probe the
University’s education set-up. Ah,
if we only knewl

And then, four long years ago,
just before the football game with
U. S. C., we, at assembly, were
shocked when a man introduced
as the captain of USC’s 1915 team,
insulted the glories of Pitt wo-
manhood, trampled the Blue and
Gold in the dust, and aroused the
ﬁghting instinct of the University
to their highest pitch.

Oh Time! Oh Lost!
hevvinsake). ,

A distinctive part of our col-
legiate lives, four long years ago,
was the inevitable box ‘lunch,
eaten each day ﬁfth hour. Those
succulent pies, that delicious sand-
wich, that satisfying piece of
candy, those luscious grapes, that
rotten apple, all are but memor-
ies. Yeh!

PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, WEDNESDAY, MAY 25, 1938

Coronation

Of. course we went in for ac-
tivities, four long years ago. Our
BMOG upperclass advisers told
us, “If I knew four long years
ago what I know oday, I would
have been the biggest MOC.” (Oh,
I don’t know).

Debating was a pretty big thing
in those days. Dick Murphy (re-
member?), elucidated the ins
(and outs) of University life, then
introduced us to that distinguished
gentleman of the silvery tongue,
Dr. W. L. Parrish, persona non
grata (Eng: In the doghouse).

Then (f. l. y. ago), that great
literary institution, The Pitt
News, attracted us. We first con-
tacted Bill Maulsby (see Latin
above). Something named Mc-
Cready Huston took Maulsby’s
place the next year.. In one year’s
time, the Latin applied to him, too.

yYes sir, ,a lot of things . have
happened in those f. l. y. Profess-
ors have come. The Commons
Room has been completed. Pro-
fessors have gone. The Cathedral
greensward has taken on a new
and brighter hue.

There was life at Pitt before we
came (f. l. y. ago); there will be
life f. l. y. after. Professors will
still come and go, students will
continue to walk the halls of high-
er learning (sans cigarettes), and
the seniors of 1941 f. 1. y. from
now, will have memories as poig-
nant, as nostalgic, as sweet, as
those wfﬁth which we conclude
these f. l. y.

speech and director of Men’s De-

bating Association, will leave the
University June 1 to take up
studies for his doctor’s degree at
Northwestern university, it was
revealed at last week’s debate ban-
quet held in his honor.

Presented with gifts from his
student-debaters at the Graystone
Manor dinner, Mr. Lomas con:
cluded his farewell speech by an-
nouncing that he intended to start
work on his degree immediately.

A graduate of Carroll college, he
has been aﬁliated with the speech
department of the University for
three years. Coming here in the
fall of 1935, he first assisted Dr. W.
M. Parrish in coaching men’s de—.
bates. -Following Dr. Parrish’s de-
parture to the University of Illi-
nois two years ago, M'r.iLomas'
took over complete direction of

He has served in this capacity
ever since. directing both freshman
and varsity squads, and compiling.
an enviable record. In the season
just concluded, his men performed
before a larger aggregate audience
in more debates than ever before.

His freshman squad alone set a
new recordin the number of con-
tests. Meetings for this group
were scheduled with Western
Pennsylvania college teams from
varsity as well as first-year groups.

Mr. Lomas has also received

recognition recently through his

effort to evaluate the aims and
purposes of debate. His newly
published “l\/Ianual of Debate
Standards” and his ballot for
grading speeches have been adopt-
ed by the Pennsylvania Fo'rensic
League and are being considered

by many other leagues. -

Voluntary Donations
To Student Committee

-Postcards have been sent to
graduating seniors requesting
contributions to the $500 goal
set by the SEA Senior ltlcmorial
coinmit.tee headed by Jack
\Vitlit1i1i, C38.

From the proceeds of the
contributed fund, the SFA
committee will erect a special
window in the Forbes street study
nook on the first floor. This nook
overlooks the Josiah K. Lilly

court at the end of the Fifth ave-
nue-Forbes street corridor.

CONNICK DESIGNER

The senior memorial window
will be designed by Charles J.
Connick, designer of all windows
in the Frick acres buildings. The
windows .are part of a series which
will be erected in the Cathedral.
The series will present in its en-
tirety, a theme appropriate to the
Cathedral. The method of the
series will be similar to that used
in designing the Stephen Foster
memorial windows.

Last year’s senior memorial was
the sesquicentennial cornerstone
(1787-1937) in the Commons
Room. Senior memorials of pre-
vious years included funds for
placing special windows in the li-
braries. Due to designing changes
in the libraries, the windows have
not yet been placed.

CONTRIBUTIONS VOLUNTARY

Contributions to the fund are
entirely Voluntary. The money
will be accepted at the time the
seniorsreceive their caps and
gowns. .

“I feel sure that every senior
will be more than glad to take
this opportunity to make his con-

tribution to. his own class memor-

ial,” Withum said. “Seniors will
have the opportunity of seeing
their memorial in place and in use
by this time next year.”

Members of Senior Memorial
committee assisting Withum are:
Thyrsa, Agness Amos, C; Beverly
Childress, Ed; Irene Maroney, Ed;
Albert Felder, E; and Nicholas
Spanos, C.-_

The itleals which the editorial board has had
in mind were not new or origiiial to its mem-

student tliougliii and eitort were to be contahied
within mei‘el_\' iuiechaiiical realiiis.

Since that time, webelieve that the News has
been directed by liberal thoiiglit on events in :3.
fast-ino\'i1ig local, natioiial, illltl iiiternatioiial
world.

lt has been our privilege to think along‘ ‘these
liberal lines and to ol)j<-ct- to liide-bound cou-

This is the one ‘reasoii why we believe ;i col-

of the graduating staff i“_ll'z.l.l. this freedom of

one of the prime assets in the -;‘leiiiocratic state

under wliicli we live.

What To Do
On ‘M ’ Day

FROEI time to time during the past year

we have bad the opportunity to uphold a.
cause, radical to some of our critics, which,
in brief, urged Paciﬁstic relations between
the people of all nations.

The movement was clixnaxed, you may re-
call, in a. Peace Rally at Soldiers and Sailors
Memorial Hall where all of two hundred stu-
dents attended to hear a national authority
on the subject.

'* But don’t get us wrong; we - backed
' the wrong horse only fifty per cent of the
_ time: That same afternoon two tliousand stu-

dents shcwed up for The Pitt News style

show and dance at the Schenley.

It is our fervent wish that on Mobilization

‘Day, which may or may not be far in the
future, there will be another Pitt News style
show, a. big one, to keep the nation out of

War.

And Thanks"
For The Memories

N THE first issue of the year during l’i-esh- A

man week, we can recall telling the new re-
cruits to campus that behind the facade of
speeches and exhortations of what the Univer-
sity had to otter to them, there was much that
remained uiisaid about the things which would
really mean something to them after the year
had passed-.
.-._Sei:iior staff members of the News have seen
Euiuch that has disillusioned them catthe Uni-

;versity during the past four ye2ir's,ibut they‘

30'-liavc also "seen nuich t.liat' lias b_eei'i- otggenuine
Qiservice to them educatioiially -and socially.
'l‘o the members of the student body and fac-

iilty who have shown ziii iiiterest and willing-
iiess to help us in our efforts dui-iiig the past
year, we say thanks in our oflicial capacity,
knowing‘ xhat they will uiiderstaiid whom we
inezin without being named. And we add it
sincere wish that we inay continue to know
tlicni in the future.

From Graduation-
To Unemployment-Lines

ODAY the g'ra.cles of seniors are due at the

l’tc;i'ist1'ar’s otlice where lists of graduates
.‘-ire already in the process of being publislied
in ofi‘icia.l form.

Arid the Seniors tlieiiiselves, looking bcyoiid
the cap and gown line of the graduatioii pro-
cession to the i‘ag'g‘ed lines of the nation’s un-
employed, are jiistiﬁeil in their question “'\.'\*'h.‘cit
iiext 1'1?” .

\‘-Re. have hezird that seniors who have jobs
wziitiii;-; for them when school oiiicially ends on
June 8 will be fewer this year than in the
years 1936 and 1937. The drive to end the de-
}_.')l"CSSl.()l'l which had just gotten underway when
the present gi'aduatin.gz; class were freshmen.
seems to be destined to be unsuccessful.

The commentary on the richest country in
the world, whose reserves of physical and
human energy have never been called upon
to produce a minimum standard of health
and decency for the majority of its popula-
tion, has been repeated so often that we won-
der if it is any longer taken seriously.

From gradiiation lines to relief lines seems
to us to be an unprogressive step but a. step
which seems to be parcel and part of the
present economic system in which our lives
are bound.

Mrs. Walls Gets
Ph D Degree

By Anna May Durkin

As usual there will be the procession of eleven
hundred candidates for degrees on "Wednesday,
June 3. ', ’ -

But :;inion.g them will be  woman whose achieve-
ments nre of special signiﬁcance. She is Mrs. Ray-

tnond A. Walls, ::"irst negro woman to be graduated

and receive’ her Ph.D. degree from the University.

Jean Hamilton Walls was born in Old Allegheny.
She attended grammar school -and high school there.
Her early childhood was spent studying art and at-
tending concerts at the Nortli Side Carnegie Music
Hall.

In 1910 she received her bachelor's degree from
the University. During her undergraduate clays
she majored in mathematics and zninored in physics.

- “Life at the University,” said Mrs. Walls smiling,
“was much dilferent than it is ‘today. Activities
were not many zior very important. There was :10
dean of women and no organized activities for
women as you have now,” continued Mrs. Wells.

Active In Social Work

After Mrs. Walls was graduated she taught in the
Fort Valley junior college. She’ also studied voci-
ology and received her master’s degree from _T.-Iow-
ard college.

In the ﬁeld of social work, Mrs. Walls has been
active. Over a perio_d of six years she was general
secretary of the Center Avenue YWCA.

“Hobbies,” said Mrs. Walls, “I have not had much
time for ‘them for the last three years. However I
did ﬁnd time to Visit the Carnegie International Art
Exhibit.

Mrs. Walls doesn’t like Modern Art.
soft or soothing, she explained. “But it is alive and
fresh” and makes one think. “Yet it gives me a
feeling of familiarity to Walk into the permanent
collection from the Romantic Age.”

“It’s not

Loves Classical Music
The theme of Mrs. Walls’ thesis is “A Study of .73

-Negro Graduates of the University of Pittsburgh

For The Decade 1926 to 1936.” From her study Mrs.
Walls has found that teachers and social workers
are the most numerous occupations._ There are also
a few physicians and housewives. ’ ‘ 1 V V

THE PITT NEWS

By Shorty Long

‘Witli wistful eyes and a triste
heart we select the plumper
typewriter in the corner and
pound out this, our final story
for The News.

VVc are rt-nicmberin,2' the shy
little girl who tripped bashful-
ly into the News ofﬁce three
years ago to tell Helen Rose Gib-
son, worn:-in’s editor, with charac-
teristic charm and understanding,
did not hesitate to take us under

her wing. We became one of her
many “little rascals.”

Too, we are remembering some
of the morsels of fun that have
'rne.d.e working on the News so de-
lightful. There were the luscious
toasted cheese sandwiches we built
on the oliice toaster; the funniness
of Iz Goldberg imitating a dancer
in “The Mikado”; the immense
kindliness of Socky; the surprise
of Helen Rose to ﬁnd our gym
shoes in her desk along with a
loaf of bread, wax paper, :1 Hal-
loween hat, a pound of butter, and
a box of pink Kleenex.

WILD NIGHTS
We shall never forget the night
Sidney Shore, Bill Murray, Sam
Carini, and us rode wildly down
the eighth ﬂoor hall on a go-cart.
All was well until Sam, carried
away by the excitement of the
ride, forgot to steer, and we sailed
blithely through the doorway of
801 by the skins of our teeth .
both of them.
' About to don the traditional cap
and gown this June are several
young men and women about
whom something should be said.
First, by virtue of his being the
editor, we shall talk about Leo
Koeberlein. He, despite the handi-
cap of being the “pride and joy of
Millvale,” is one of the most pop-
ular gentlemen of the college
Press. He has been through the
Mill as well as the Vale of experi-
ence on the university publications,
having contributed his share of
blood and thunder to “The Jour-
neyman” as well as headlines to
the News. His charm lies in his
unassuming, friendly manner.

across the street to the portals of
the PAA to ask the doorman for a
match and was evicted. Racky
was the voice you heard over KQV
this winter reciting “all the news
that’s Pitt to print.” Goombye,
Rack.

Jimmy Donoghue, who divides
his time between editing The Oak-
land News, writing an occasional
political column for the News, and
studying constitutional law, is a
delightful person. Naturally, if
one were an Irish O’Donaghue, one
would be delightful, witty, shrewd,
and discriminating.

ROGOW TESTS

Mel Rogow is the lad responsi-
ble for all those people taking their
Wassermann test. He was running
all over the place with test tubes
and things. And he took care of
the tuberculosis campaign and tore
about talking about positives and
negatives all the time. In his
spare time he entertains Pittpourri
columnists.

Jean Barnes, we predict, is a
‘nationally-known writer of the fu-
!ture. She has written a column
for the News, a column for the
,Panther, worked for the Bulletin
Index last summer, and recently
won honorable mention in the con-

test sponsored by Vogue maga-
zine. Barnesie is an authority on
swing music, besides being a popu-
lar young lady because of her
charm, sense of humor, and her
enormous heart of gold. Barnes,
we love you! ‘

GOONS LIKE COOPER

Dick Cooper, he of the Byronic
hair, is a man without a country.
Just what he is on the News staff
no one knows, but we shall call
him zi Reporter Emeritus, just for
the heckuvit. He has dallied about
the copy desk and written some
feature ‘stories. Dick is a quiet,
congenial lad and is well-liked by
all the goons on the staff.

Marion Mehlman is the girl who
is always calling McKesport on the
phone and making our business
manager mad. She is a history
major, is going to be a very capa-
ble schoolteacher, and is one of
the friendliest of people. Marion
reigns over the copy desk when
Bill Murray goes to concerts and
things. Goombye, Toots.

Ray Maclntyre is another “pride
and joy of Millvale” only he
doesn’t live in Millvale. He lives
out in the provinces north of there,
as we do. He, erstwhile copy
desker that he is, and Leo and us
are thinking of starting a Pitt-
Millvale club. Mac has a fondness
for orange covered peanuts, lis-
tening to police calls on the radio,
and playing hopscotch in the cellar
of the Maclntyre country home.

AND THEN—SPANOS

Nick Spanos, notorious for Cap
and Gown shows that he and
friend Saffron wrote, was the guy
wot wrote “Stop and Go,” the
News movie review. He is still
mad at the Penn and the Stanley
because they are not lavish with
their passes.

Hay I-lay, here comes Austin!
Austin, the pride and joy of the
Sigma Chis, is the handsome gen-
tleman who interviewed Lily Pons.
Also he is a photographer of some
renown as well as an active mem-
ber of Pitt Players.

What does one write about one’s
self? Mon Dieu! Well, we are
5 ft. 2 in. tall, with blue eyes and
tou-sled hair, and we love every-
body.

Mrs. Starrett
Writes Booklet
On Library

Marked by beautiful typogra-
phy, ﬁne hand-made, deckled-
edged paper, a booklet, “The
Darlington Memorial Library,”
was issued this week by the Uni-
versity Press.

The booklet‘, of 128 pages, set in
Caslon Old Style type, is by Mrs.
Agnes Starrett, assistant profes-
sor of English.

Prepared with the cooperation
of J. Howard Dice, librarian; and
Mrs. Lois Mulkearn, Darlington
room librarian, the booklet is a
statement of appreciation for what

the Darlington Library is in con-
tent and in meaning.

The history of the Darlington
Library, a description of its pres-
ent quarters on the sixth ﬂoor of
the Cathedral, and some comment
on some of the rare Americana in
the collection together with a re-
production of one of the ﬁrst
maps of the world, published in
the 1532 edition of “Novus Orbis
Regio” by Simon Gyrnaeus; and
reproduction of a holograph letter
by Major Robert Stobo, an engi-
neer in Washington’s army, show-
ing the design of Fort Duquesne
make the booklet a valuable con-
tribution to the background of the
Darlington Library collection.

Kralil Awarded
Scholarship

First of the scholarships to be

lae, natural science fraternity, was

to have men such as Carlson, Ol-

also has Sutherland, the finest

Rose Bowl Refusal, Penn Relay
Triumph Among Year’s Highlights

By JIl‘VI DAILEY

October 4——Not much hap-
pened in the way of sports for
Pitt fans until the Panther foot-
ball squad swung into serious
action against \Vest Virginia.
(“‘ur]y Stebbins picked up two
touchdowns in the last quarter
to pull a tight game out of the ﬁre,

October 18-—One of the year’s

great disappointments was the
third successive scoreless tie with
Fordham at New York. Goldberg
ran for a nulliﬁed touchdown,
called back because of lVIatisi’s al-
leged holding.

November 8—In the biggest
game in the nation on this par-
ticular Saturday Pitt waited until
the ﬁnal quarter to smear through
for three touchdowns against
Notre Dame, who had visions of a
win. The Irish lead until then,
6-0.

indignant over -— Jim Dailey’s
mock interview with Barrett Mel-
vin.

I’m no kith or kin of Barrett
Melvin’s. To be truthful, not even
a very good friend. We don't get
along. At our first meeting, I
cordially disliked the fellow. He
had a way about him that I con-
sidered rather arrogant and con-
ceited. But after I became bet-
ter acquainted with him I realized
that he meant nothing by it—that

,%that were apt to be misread at
[first acquaintance.

} I’ve known him for two years—-
fbeen around him a lot in the same

he simply had certain mannerisms

‘crowd. And I must admit that
I’ve never heard him boast of his
golf game. And you’ll admit he
has a game worth boasting about.
But even when he was asked
questions and given a chance to
“shine” he passed them up. Any
one who knows him will know
this.

And anyone who has conversed
with Melvin knows what a real
admiration and liking he has for
Bill Daddio. He might make such
a remark as Jim Dailey wrote if
he and Bill were kidding each
other, but otherwise—no!

In my opinion Dailey either has
a ba-d case of “sour grapes” or else
he simply does not know Melvin.

I don’t know how Barrett took
that piece——he probably laughed
it off but I imagine it “hit home”
and I wish he knew my reactions
because I’m sure they are identical
with those‘ of any one else who
knows Barrett, and who happen-
ed to read that utterly untrue
article. Boo!

condition, didn’t start winning un-

and hasn’t yet quite recovered.

SOPHOIVIORE SHINE

Mason and Bennett were unable
to do their best indoors. All this
kept the squad from reaching its
full potentialities until the ﬁnal
indoor sessions. However, the
sophomores were the bright spots
of the indoor festivities and are
largely responsible for Pitt’s suc-
cessful outdoor results.

Sophomores A1 McKee, A1 Fer-

I tered.

‘men were ready to walk off with

honors. Pitt beat West Virginia in

[a dual meet, won a Quadrangular

affair from Minnesota, Purdue, and
Northwestern, scalped Temple,
‘and won from Penn State in the
only home meet of the year.

HIT STRIDE

They broke the monotony of
dual meets and made a brilliant
showing at the Penn Relays. Dur-
ing these meets Woodruff won the
half and mile; and captured the
quarter mile at the Penn Relays.

Mason started to break the tape
first in the 100 and 220, and Ohl
broke the tape ﬁrst in these events
when Mason missed out. Pete
Bennet won the high jump; Bazyk
the shot put. McKee or Ferrara
scampered in first in the 440. Ohl
won the broad jump. Walter
Sterner started to show promise as
a two miler and captured this
event against Temple.

Behind all this winning the
thought of the IC4A in New York
on June 3 and 4 was a steady un-
dertone. Last year Pitt won the
IC4A title and a successful defense
of that title would make this sea-
son the greatest in Panther history.
Meets are not won on pencil and
paper and yet sometimes pencil
and paper ﬁguring may prove an
index of what can be expected.

Pitt will go into that meet fairly
certain of 15 points. The mile re-
lay and Johnny Woodruff’s capture
of the half and quarter will send
Pitt off to a good start.

Bennett .has jumped high
enough to. capture a first or sec-
ond in the high jump. Mason or
Ohl should score pointage in the
clashes. Bazyk in the shot put and
Ohl in the broad jump are other
Panther potentialities. The com-
petition will be tougher this year
because some of the California
squads will be East. Yet there is
more than a bare possibility that
Pitt may; make it two in a row.
And when they do, a review of the
1938 track season will be more

men in the East.

March 2—They won the city ti-
tle. Pitt’s quint beat Tech, 36-30.

March 12——Swimmers sweep to
EISA championship in Metropoli-
tan Club meet.

March 14-—Football men laid
down the window-smashing para-
phcnalia for sterner stuff as Jock
announced spring ‘practice. The
hockey team beat Tech, 1-0, but
were bruised slightly.

March 23—The hockey team lost
the ﬁrst play-off game to the
Dukes on Vance’s lone goal, 1-0.
The Bluff went wild. Two days
later they were laughing out of
the other side
as Pitt won the
series with a
t h r e e g 0 al
splurge, 3-0.

April 6--Pitt’s
h o c k e y team
lost the cham-
pionship play-
offs to a bruis-
ing John Car-
roll sextet, 4-1

 

.and 2-1. Ar-

senault and Co.

smashed up the

Wood;-uff Pitt team so
badly in the first game the Panth-
ers had to play the second game

with three reserves.

April 25—Intramural baseball
hit the campus with a bang, entries
coming from every branch of the
campus. The Varsity football
team beat the Alumni, 21-0. Thur-
bon starred.

May 2—Spor_ts Editor Levison
sent back glowing dispatches from
Philadelphia telling how Pitt won
the Penn Relays. Woodruff, ably
assisted by Ohl, Ferrara, McKee
and Mason, took the country by
storm. Baseball began in earnest
as the schedule was announced.
Everybody from the Faculty down
to the Rover Boys had a team en-

appropo.

Following
The Greek  
Sports

By BERT JAFFE
Dear Boss:

Well Len, this is the last issue
of the year. Mr. Corley is tired
seeing me come into his office to
ﬁnd out what the Greeks have
done of late. It has been a lot
of fun.

Interfraternity sports won’t
seem the same without Micheloson,
Hensley, Delich and Moffatt of the
Kappa Sigs, Dalle Tezze, and Ur-
ban of Phi Kaps, the Reiter Twins
of SAM, Adams and Patrick of
SAE, Tack and Wilson of Lambda
Chi, Wright of Phi Delts, Bricker
and Byers of Theta Chi, Berg of
the Delts, Danton and Grennen of
Phi Gams, and Grossman and Sig-
mon of the Pi Lams. I’m positive
the loss will be felt by both
their respective and the competing
houses.

Just for the sake of the record
I will put down the winners so
that you may have a list of them.

Touch Football . . . . . . .Lambda. Chi‘

Volley Ball . . . . . . . ..Kappa Sigma.

Basketball . . . . . . . . .Kappa Sigma

Indoor Track . . . . . ..Kappa Sigma

Outdoor Track . . . . . . . . . .Phi Gams
Sweepstakes. . Sigma Alpha Epsilon
Bowling‘. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Theta Chi

SAE also won the interfraternity
sing held at the annual Yuletide
festival.  The Phi Eps ﬁnally set-
tled the ping-pong tourney by tak-
ing over» the Lambda Chi’s. The
Pi Lams won the first semester
scholarship trophy.

At the‘ present time, the Greeks
are in the midst of a hot mushball
race. Phi Kaps, last year’s. win-
ners, look like a repeater.

It 1ok_-s like Kappa Sigma will
win the All-Point trophy after all.
The PhitGams can’t possibly catch
them in mushball and the ﬁnal
scholarship award.

Yours faithful,
BERT.

and the winners of the regular
season.

Four clubs are still very much
in the running for the champion-
ship. The Scotts, Phys, Ed.
Sophs, Faculty, and Pharmacy are
at this writing undefeated. One
team will be eliminated this after-
noon at 3:30 when the Sophs face
the Pharmacy on the football
practice ﬁeld.

The Scotts seem to be the

league’s outstanding team, if there '
1S one. They have cleaned up all!

opposition, including the danger-
ous Olson Swedes. With Scarfpin
and Kish doing mound duty, and
Micheloseon, Fullerton, and Dad-
dio punching out base hits, the
Scots look unbeatable.

Probably about 20 boys will be
included on the All Star roster,
which will be available in Frank
Carver’s office today or tomorrow.
Several outstanding candidates
will be eliminated from conside: ex-
tion regardless of who wins the
league crown.

In addition to the Pharmacy-
Sophs game, three other scraps are
listed this afternoon. At 5 o’clock
the Starks battle the ROTC on the
football practice ﬁeld.

Stadium games have the Dents
against the Engineers at 5:00 and
the Scrantonians meeting Kappa
Alpha Phi at six-thirty.

Tomorrow the Faculty faces a
severe test in the Frosh Football
crew at 3:30 on the practice ﬁeld.

All team managers should con-

there is a change of schedule.

be formed are now being complet-
ed, accordin to the General
Alumni Association office.

Membership in this club will be
exclusively for alumni who grad-
uated from the Western Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania, as the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh was then
called, in the class of 1888 or
classes preceding 1888.

Members of the 50-year club
will be celebrating at least the

who meet this requirement, and
are therefore eligible for member-
ship.

Organization of this new club
is under the direction of Alexan-

Cromwell and the Commonwealth
government in England, has been
unearthed by Theodore Parker,
lecturer in history at the Uni-
versity, it was revealed today.

‘The document, ordering the con-
ﬁscation of land belonging to gen-
try and noblemen hostile to the
Commonwealth, is dated February
21, 1651. It was obtained by Mr.
Parker at an Ohio auction sale
last week.

According to Mr. Parker, only
two other committee reports on
the confiscation of lands during
that period in English history are
in existence. The contents of his
recent discovery, he believes, have
apparently never been published.

Scrawled in age-faded ink on
yellow-frayed pages are PTOV1‘
sions approved “at the Commit-
tee of Parliament for removing
Obstructions in the sale of delin-
quent lands and estates,” of the
noblemen siding with the cause of
the beheaded Charles I and the
Stuart kings. Reason given for
the action is treason.

little by the fearless political re-
porting of Herbert Rackoff, who
embarked on a one-man muck-
raking crusade, which shook the
campus from its spring lethargy.

Prominent news ﬁgures, how-
ever, are more numerous. News
editor Leopold Koeberlein con-
tinued as top man in the ﬁeld of
publications, guiding the news
along the far-sighted, progressive
course of the more stormy ﬁrst-
semester. (We say this with the
hope that this laudatory bit will
slip past the weary eyes of ye
editor, modest soul).

Versatile A1 Barr kept up his
fast pace in a long string of ac-
tivities to merit the officially be-
stowed title of outstanding senior
man ‘ In the ﬁeld of student gov-
ernment, E. Ernest Rose deserves
much credit for a sincere, though
fruitless attempt to do a little
much-needed reforming.

William Stark again stands out
for his ability as a debater, his
work in SFA. And brother Ber-

With Delta Sigs

Some interesting reports from
the Theta Chi’s of N. Dithridge
Street concern a big merger
which these fraters experienced
recently. It seems that the na-
tional social fraternity Delta
Sigma Lambda merged not long 1
ago with Theta Chi. This meant
no additions for the local boys
but the ’1‘ech Theta Chi’s were
increased on Sunday by the ini-
tiation of ten Delta Sigs from
that campus.

May, 19———Pitt Players hold an-ii

pleasure than any cigarette
I ever smoked—bar none.”

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Mbre smokers every day
find a new brand of smoking
pleasure in Chesterﬁeld-’s refresh-
ing mildness and better taste.

It’s because Chesterﬁelds are ‘
made of mild ripe tobaccos and
pure cigarette paper—the ﬁnest
ingredients a cigarette can have.
