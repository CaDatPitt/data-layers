More than 250 students attending ‘yesterday’s SGB Forum seemed divided on the issue otreinstituting a draft

registration.

By COLLEEN MCDONALD.

Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt officials are requesting
an 18.2 percent increase in
state appropriations, to a total
of $79,916,700 for fiscal year
 in their ‘annual budget
',:J:sentation to the General
Assembly on Feb. 5.

“This is a very reasonable
and conservative request,”
said John Yeager, budget
assistant to the Office of
Budget and Planning.

He said the increase includes
no new programs. Its purpose
is to cover inﬂationary in-
creases, salaries and expenses.

Yeager also mentioned that

"It's Belt-Tightening Ti

competes with such programs
as welfare and state highway
repairs. He emphasized that
there must be continuous
pressure on behalf of higher
education for the Common-
wealth to recognize it as an
important funding priority.

The university received an I
appropriation of $67.6 million '
in the fiscal‘ year 1980, $7.4
million less than it requested.

Thomas Lamb, assistant vice
chancellor for public affairs, is
very pessimistic that there will
be any sizable increase in this
year’s appropriations because
of the" governfnent’s present
revenue problems.

' -“Revenues are off and it’s

me" At Pitt

belt-tightening time,” said.
Lamb. '

The only two major sources
of funding available to the
university to offset inﬂationary-
cost increases are the Com-
monwealth’s» appropriation and
student tuition, according to

Chancellor Posvar’s April 1979
statement to the General
Assembly. a
The chancellor’s statement
concluded that “if the Com-
monwealth does not appro-
priate funds sufficient to cover
cost increases due to inﬂation,
rising tuition will result in a
tragic ‘fall in the number of
Pennsylvania students who can
affordto attend our publicly-

supported institutions. ’ ’

is-irregularities in Earning Credits Topic a

By TERESA SOKOL
Pitt News Staff Writer

Irregularities in earning credits
for independent studies, self-
designed majors, internship and
the inclusion of new certiﬁcate
programs were discussed by the
College of Arts and Sciences (CAS)
Council during its ﬁrst meeting of
the new decade.

Dean Irwin J. Schulman asked
the council. to look into what he
termed, “the irregular way that
people earn credit” at the
-4' niversity. Speciﬁcally, Schulman
cited independent study,
designed majors, and internships
for. credit as areas where there

appears to be some discrepancy as‘

self-‘ -

to the academic value of various
student projects. ‘
The value of the programs as
‘ more student centered and ful-
ﬁlling'student’s needs is not under
question, according to Schulman.
In _fact, Schulman explained,
some previously self-designed maj-

ors such as psychobiology and-

womens studies have evolved in
certified university programs.
Psychobiology was approved last
term as a”new major for the college
and discussion on a Womens
Studies major is ongoing, noted
Schulman. _.
Schulman stated that in the self-
designed major students maytface

When the self-designed _ major
began in 1971 only juniors‘ (58-75
credits) could apply, said Schul-
man. ’ —
“Now we find some seniors
pulling together an ad hoc
self-designed major because they
have difficulty meeting the major

added. » t

Students Divided on
Draft Registration Issue

’ By JEFF COUCH
News Editor

Pitt students are divided on the
issue of mandatory draft registra-
tion,- if yesterday’s Student Gov-
ernment ‘Forum on the draft
represented an accurate cross-sec-
tion of the student‘ body.

Students were given an oppor-

'tuﬁity yesterday to -express their
views on draft registration and the
current international situation, in a
packed Student Union Lower
Lounge. ' '_,

The Studen. Government Board,
who sponsored the forum, will use
the view points expressed by the
students to arrive at a “concensus
on the draft registration and maybe
even on the draft itself,” according
to SGB president Bill Abraham. A

resolution‘will be formulated by the ~

board and sent to Washington next
week.

Students both for and against
registration were divergent and
often emotional in expressing their
views. »

Some students supporting the
registration did so out of asense of
duty or patriotism. .

One student said that many other
countries of the world, both
democratic and communist, require
citizens to serve in the armed

,“Going down andlregistering for
the draft is not too much to ask,”‘
said Tim Kearney.

Another student said that United
States vital interests are threatened
by the Soviet presence in Afghani-
stan. Instead of “turning the other
cheek as, in the past,” said the
student, President Carter is trying
to show the Soviets some strength.

The «student claimed that the
U.S. government will not try to take
control of the oil ﬁelds, as some

peoplesuggest. Rather, the U.S.:

will try to stop another country (the
Soviet Union) from taking over.

advisor to a student. '

In other academic areas, council
postponed voting on a certificate.
program in Film Studies until the
members have more time to
research the proposal.

Dean Schulman said that al-
though he was enthusiastic about
the proposal it would be necessary
to regularize an agreement ‘CAS
has with the Pittsburgh Film
Makers.

A three credit course in practical
ﬁlm making labeled CAS 100 is
currently offered to students at the
Pittsburgh rFilm Makers. The

- course has a $100 stipend because

it is not. taught by Pitt faculty,

’ according to Schulman. —

Students opposing the rein-
statement of draft registration
believed that it would lead to

inscription (the draft) and possibly '

World War III.

“Registration will be the first '

step to World War III which will
wipe out the whole’ world,” said
one student. A .

Jeff Miller, warned that draft
registration will lead to inscription
which will intum lead to war. “It
is the obligation of the people in
this country to stand up against the
draft,” Miller paid. '

The United States should _ be

cautious and not overreact, accord- .
ing to Todd C. Park. Over reaction

to the current Afghanistan situa-
tion may lead to‘ a situation “like
McCarthyism and the Korean
War,” Park said. °

“I, for one, don’t want to die for
Jimmy Carter "to be re-elected.

president,” Park said. '
Ellis Cannon, another student,

- said he could not believe Park took

such a stand.
Carter would never jeopardize

the lives of ‘,‘millions and millions
of ' Americans in
.order to be re-elected, according to

and millions’ ’

Cannon. ‘

“This is simply registration, it is
not‘, a draft—it is registration,”

Cannon said.

Kerry. Warren said that since
Carter’s discussion of draft regis-.

tration began, many people have

wrongly assumed that war will

result. .
“My analysis of Carter’s move to

reinstitute draft registration is that I

towards the Soviet Union,” she

' "said.

‘necessary, in defending the Per-
sian Gulf area, reinstituting draft

t Meeting   .

Schulman called the program
“uniquely situated” in terms of
active interest on the part of both,
students and faculty.

CAS Council unanimously ap-
proved the revised certificate,
program for Womens Studies,
raising the certification ‘require-
ments Trom 15 to 18 credits.
Although a vote on the Womens
Studies proposal for a major was
expected at this meeting, Cynthia
Sutherland, Womens Studies co-

gordinator, asked that the council’s

vote be postponed until next month
since she is preparing an extensive
presentative for the council, noted
Schulman.

Bob Donnorummo of Pitt’s
Center for International Studies
has been one of the recipients of a

-recently released Presidential

Commission Report on the inade-
quate programs of foreign lan-
guage and international relations
studies in the United States.
“The number of students who
reach the job market with these
skills and knowledge have been
steadily decreasing. The report
also attributed the responsibility to
the employers .as well as the
students for waiving these require-
ments or training the‘ students
themselves," Donnorummo said.

Pitt News Staff Writer -

After more than 16 months in
production and an unusual amount
of problems, the 1979 edition of the
Owl (Pitt's yearbook) will be on
sale by mid-February, according to
Rita Tate, editor of the 1980 Owl.

Tate said her staff not only had to
contend with work. on the 1980
yearbook, but had to complete the
1979 edition as well.

“There wasn’t as much time and
effort put into last year's book as
there should have been,” said

However, the 1980 staff is not
taking any chances. They have
already completed work on the fall
activities section, the senior por-
traits section, promotional events,
and are presently rounding out the
winter term. 

All of the sections will be tied
together with a futuristic 80s theme
of looking through a crystal ball,
Tate said.

For the first time ever, the Owl is
sponsoring Pitt Yearbook Week to
be held sometime in March or
April. »

“We want to bring the yearbook
out into the open and let the
students see what’s going on,”
said Tate.

Some of the week's activities will
include a discount coupon distri-

bution, a shoot-your-own-contest

where students will be able to take
their own pictures for the book,
candid shots of the “average Joe”
around campus and various other
activities.. If successful, the week
will become an annual event, she
said.

Since last year's book had so
many difficulties, ﬁnancial as well

K.

as operational, many believe the
Owl could be in danger offolding.
Tate doesn’t believe this will
happen.

She noted however, that ﬁnan-
cially, much rests on the increase of
the student activities fee.

“I’ve seen a turn—around in the
Owl,” she commented.‘ “My staff
is good and industrious.”

“Hopefully though, we’ll . be
around for a couple of years yet-,”
she said. '

Views At Draft Forum

(Continued from page I)

A ‘registration adds strong credibility

to thispdoctrine,” she said. “I feel
such credibility is essential.”
Another student said reinstate-

. ment of draft registration will not._

scare the Soviets and may speed up
the “processes to ﬁght a war.”

“I do not think an actual threat
on .paper.- (draftcards) will do
anything,” he said.

"In attendance at the forum were
ﬁve aides to local Congressmen,
two aides to Senators Schweiker

, Vjand Heinz, representatives‘ of the
‘ .Kennedy campaign, and a candi-

date for Congress.

. Herrmann said Soviets may have
reacted to U.S. strengths in the

area rather than our weaknesses
(Iranian situation) coupled with the
fear that the Afghanistan govern-
ment was unstable.

The U.S. decision to sell
technology and award most favored
nation trade status to China also
poses a threat to the Soviets while
reinstating the draft may not be as
important in the Kremlin’s view,
he said. '

Also attending were several
professors who served as refer-
ences for students with questions
concerning draft registration and
the current international situation.

Rick Herrmann, an expert on
Soviet foreign policy, offered his
views on the situation in Afghan-
istan.

Some Food
For Thought  

During the fall term, residence hall students’

expressed their concern about the quality of the food
service in the Lothrop and Towers cafeterias.
Complaints were widespread, as evidenced by the
approximately 1,200 students who signed petitions
complaining of dissatisfaction with the preparation,
sanitation and taste of the food served in the
cafeteria.

Specifically, students complained of cold or
undercooked meats and poultry, starch, fatty food,

blase menus, glassware with ragged edges, fragments V

of bone and other foreign substances in the food, and
sour milk in the dispensers. _

Throughout the term, meetings were held by the
Resident Student Association’s . Food. Service
Committee, pertinent administrators, Student

Government Board members, and many of the ‘

student complaintants to discussand try.to solve the
problems. Some of the students, privately and
publicly, expressed their doubts about resolving all
the "problems. Those students were afraid that the
adminstrators’ attempt to let the matter die with the
status quo poor food service would remain intact.

There is now an indication that all the complaints
and countless discussions have begun to pay off. In
particular, two items of discussion at the RSA Food
Service Committee meeting last Thursday show signs
of change—positive change resulting from the
student complaints. '

The first positive development was the '
‘announcement that a survey, designed to ascertain

student opinions about the food_ service would-be
distributed to cafeteria patronsin February. The
second development is that Key Management’s
contract is up for renewal in April. Key is the

independent food service operating at Pitt.

.     on: raw’ News

Page 6—Wednesday, January 30, 1980

In the case of the food survey, students may have
real input into what types of fo_od are served in the
cafeteria. Students and groups, this ‘newspaper
included, have complained continuously about the
lack of student input in determining university policy
and changes. We hope that students take the survey
seriously. It is a rare opportunity when Pitt actually

uses student suggestions in policy formulation. Do °_
_ not pass it up. ‘

The status of the current food service’s contract is,

F:

perhaps, an even more important developmengégj

Many of the student complaints last term centered on
areas for which Key Management was responsible.

We do not lay the blame, however, solely on Key
Management. The university administration is also
responsible for what students are fed, and under
what conditions. But some of the blame does rest
with Key, and something must be done about it.

The university administration has offered Food
Service Committee ‘members the chance to sample
other food services at other universities. This will be
a perfect opportunity for students to have the
experience necessary to have a_ say in the operation of
the cafeteria.

.Do not be mistaken. We do not necessarily
advocate changing food services. If students find a
more attractive type of food service, Key
Management may .be able to accomodate student
wishes by changing its mode of operation.

If, however, Key finds it impossible towork under
a new system, perhaps it is time for a change inifood
services. . ,'

We commend’ the’ university administrators
involved in the management of the cafeterias for
providing students with an opportunity to help
institute changes in the cafeterias’ operations.

_Perhaps a precedent has been set, and now other

university operations will be open to student
scrutiny, in the future.

Stockholder Impact Being Felt By Corporate Upper Echelon,

By JOSEPH C. HEIM

Pitt News Staff Writer

senior level personnel.

Often, at least in the public
stereotypical view, corporations are
perceived as acting mainly in the
interest of proﬁt maximization; in
spite of much of the media blitz
mounted by many multinationals,
Mobil Oil perhaps being the "most
proliﬁc.

However, to view the corporation
as “one” is a gross distortion.
There is a very real difference in
many cases» between management
and stockholders. In fact,
relatively unknown to the public,
stockholders have been more open,

and many have injected an ethical

component in corporate decision-
making. This is a change that is
having wide implications, and no
longer can it be assumed that
stockholders will limit their con-

 

According to the Securities and
Exchange Commission, a resolu-
tion at the stockholders voting must
receive three percent of the total
stockholder vote if it is to be
introduced in the following year.
Thus, if a vote on a resolution gets
but three percent, it is law that it
must be included on an agenda.
And the fact that a resolution is on
the agenda inevitably leads to a
discussion and examination of the
area under consideration.

In recent years, a surprising
number of resolutions have been
introduced by “ethically” minded
stockholders. Let us for the
moment look at a few examples. At

,the annual meeting of Bank of

America’s stockholders, the issue
of South African loans made by the
Bank of America was discussed. In

votes favored the stopping of loans,
to South Africa. Since the vote was

over three percent,«it is guaranteed
to be an agenda item at the next
stockholder meeting. A similar
event happened at Citibank, and
Citibank changed its policy to the
effect that Citibank pledged to
make no more loans to the South
African government, but rather to
limit “its credit selectively to
constructive private sector activi-
ties that create jobs which benefit
all South Africans." General
Motors spokesman admit, accord-
ing to Harvard Business Reviews
that shareholder activism had a
large role in the desegregation of
facilities in South Africa.

The issue is not South Africa.‘

Shareholders of power companies
who introduced resolutions against
nuclear power plants received 11%

‘. ..¢¢fJ1.5. ;t.°. °°1'I?.<>!?te. . pr..0ﬁts_ and .thé voting-«.8.-4% .o.fthe,= shareholder .o.f.t.h_e.v<_>t.e. at. .C.e.n.tra1.H.udSon .and..

10.1% of the vote of the
shareholders of ‘Detroit Edison.
Other resolutions have been
introduced dealing with issues
ranging from television advertising
to children to labor policies. Other
areas, especially those reﬂeeting
ethical concerns, would never have
been on stockholders agendas, now
they are‘ increasingly found there.
_The impact on management is
often indirect, though. The
shareholder's desires are not easily
translated into direct action. How-

_ ever, the effect is that management

must respond toisuch concerns.
Managers themselves are increas-
ingly aware of the social implica-
tions of their policies. The major
advantage of this “shareholder
activism” may lie in the fact that it
is forcing attention to be devoted to
these social implications. Often

\

holders, as was. the case in 1978
when Gulf Oil
resoultion to adopt-.»a policy pro-
hibiting political contributions in
South Korea. General Motors
Sullivan proposals were introduced
by a board member.

As Allen Nelson, a senior ofﬁcer
of Connecticut General Life Insur-‘ '
ance states, “I believe the "effec-
tiveness of the shareholder move-
ment has been demonstrated in
several different ways—through
the higher levels of management
involvement, the significant num-
ber of companies dialoging with
shareholders, the increased sophis-
tication of the resolutions them-

impact the resolutions are having

on the companies themselves.”

A major area of concern is that

are held by institutional investors,
such as the trust departments of
major commercial banks. , These
institutional investors are often the
largest, or'majority shareholders,
taken all together. However,
pressure is being brought on them,
often by their own shareholders.
The bank, for example, may ﬁnd it

The government itself is also
involved. ' Just recently, the
Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion adopted rules that call for
increased, accountability and cor-
porate disclosure in a broad
spectrum of areas. The role of the
government cannot-be overlooked.

In conclusion, one should not
assume that corporate stockholders
have’ become champions of ethical
considerations above the more
traditional corporate concerns‘.
However, it is signiﬁcant that
ethical issues have become a major
concern of the stockholder, and

that such concerns are having an

impact on corporate policy and
operations, if only indirectly. It is a
major change that such ethical
issues have ‘become a major
concern of the stockholder. ' In
essence, such corporate ethical
stockholder concern is not a fad. An
increasing number of stockholders

0" want the ethical issues of their

corporation addressed also.
Whether such ethical concerns are
easily correlated with other areas is
difficult to state clearly. What is
important is the fact that the ethical

 component has become ﬁxed as

one of the stockholder - investor’s
demands, and not only the general
public's, and this fact is signiﬁcant

and will become increasingly

adequate. There are some 2900
dormitory residents who just
recently signed a petition to the
same effect. If the'task force truly

wants student input they should
seriously consider -this petition.

' Allowing just four students on a

task force suggest policies for 4000
students to follow is absurd. The

“hush—hush” attitude surrounding
this entire incident leads many of

us to believe that resident_ students
will have very little say, if any, in

_' the ﬁnal decision making process.

If a drastic change is made in the
visitation policy, waiting lists for
local apartments will far excede the
waiting list for university housing.

Obscuring
The Problem

I strongly agree with James
Pickett when he wrote in the
January 21 issue of The Pitt News
that “...Tests Unlimited (a distri-
butor of tests used in university_
classes) seems to subvert...the

spirit if not the letter, of the
guidelines set down by the
University...” However, our agree-
ment ends there.

Ibelieve that young 'Pickett’s
harangue against The Pitt News for
running Tests Unlimited’s adver-
tisement was unjustified. Lopping
off the head of thelbearer of bad
news may make Mr. Pickett feel
better yet the bad news remains.

The temptation to cheat will

always exist as long as we place”

students in a competitive situation.
The key question is do we hide -the

problem or deal with it in the light _

of day? Asking The Pitt News to
drop such ads only serves to
obscure the problem.

~ Instructors have many ways at
their command to reduce test
fraud. Instructors can have multi-
ple tests and decide to use one at
the last.minute; they can design

_ new tests for each term; they can

use essay type tests; or they can
simply tell the students exactly
what they need to know and test
just that. Any number or novel
approaches can‘ be taken to
eliminate the problem gnd not just

mask it.

If The Pitt News refused Tests
Unlimited’s ads, copies of exams
would still float through dorms,
students would still have notes on
their wrists, and morals would still
be put to the test. The answer to
the problem lies not wtih ignorance
but with ‘recognition and action.

I have known Mr. Pickett for
some time and have found him to
be ‘deeply concerned with his

* teaching responsibilities. His letter

is a reflection of that commitment.
However, onthis issue I beg to
differ.

The Panthers are back in action tonight against Westminster

ByMARIE
Pitt News Staff Writer 1
Coaches have always said that

.statistics don’t necessarily win

games. Such was the case in
Pittsburgh as the Maryland Lady
Terrapins invaded Fitzgerald Field-
house and handed the Pantherettes
a tough 67-66 loss. ‘The
Pantherettes now sport a season

record of 15-7 going into tonight’s
contest with Syracuse. A
The first half found Pitt
struggling with Maryland’s zone
defense, a particularly effective
one because of Maryland’s good
height. "However, Pitt’s own
defense kept them in the game.
This may be due to the fact that the
team did not seem to key on
Maryland’s all-America Kris
Kirchner. A

“There was just no way to stop
that kind of talent,” remarked
Coach Jean Balthaser. “We

couldn't shut her down inside
because she can swish them from

ﬁfteen feet out.” s

Thus’, the Pantherettes stayed
close by shutting off everyone else
At half, the Pantherettes went to
the locker room trailing 36-30.

The second half was ﬁlled with
tension and excitement as the
Pantherettes rallied slowly but
surely, only to fall one point short
of upsetting a nationally ranked

_ (15th) team.

Rebounding was the key to the
game as "Maryland dominated the
boards. The Terrapins grabbed 48
stray shots, ‘many of which went

« time is 5:45.

right back up for two points. Pitt
managed 35 rebounds on the night.
The fact that Maryland was
putting their offensive rebounds in
the bucket after several tries was
evident in the shooting percent-

ages. Although the Pantherettes 1

were hot-handed; sinking 50
percent of their shots, they only
managed to take 52. Maryland got
off 83 shots, so their dismal 37
percent shooting ‘didn't really hurt
them.

It can safely be assumed that the
Pantherettes did not lose it at the
charity stripe, where they dropped
in 14 of 18 shots. Pitt also did not
give Maryland the game at the foul
line, for they only had nine chances
and put in ﬁve ‘of them.

Game-high scoring honors went
Kirchner, who pumped in 31 points
for the Terrapins while grabbing 17
rebounds. Pitt’s Pam Miklasevich
topped Kirchner in the rebound
category with 18, while tallying 20
points. Debbie Lewis added 19,
Gail Aughburns 15, and Penny
‘Welsh 10 to round out the

Pantherette scoring.

“The girls really played well,
both offensively and defensively,”
said Balthaser. But it wasn’t
enough to win, and nobody is
happy when you lose.

The game ‘is history now.
Tonight’s opponent, Syracuse,
showcases a 12-4 record and brings

with it a slight height advantage.

This will be the last home game for ‘

the Pantherettes, as they hit the
road for the next two weeks. Game‘

 

Gail Aughburns was consistent a

Pitt Rebounds For
‘Flashy’ 56-51 Win

By SAMUEL SCIULLO
Pin News Staff Writer
The Pitt basketball team pro-
vided itself with a much-needed
emotional lift Monday night in a
56-51 win over the St. Francis Red

'Flash, at Loretto, Pa. The win ran V

the Panthers’ record to 13-5 on the
season. Pitt is 4-1 in Eastern Eight
play. ‘ .

The most pleasant aspect of the
game had to be the play of Pitt

' center Sam Clancy. After a sub-par

performance in last week’s upset
loss at Cleveland State, Clancy has
come back with two consecutive
strong performances, 16 points and‘
17 rebounds against Duke, and 22
points and 6 rebounds, plus four
blocked shots Monday night.

Clancy’s big game came at a
much-needed time, because the
Panthers’ other regular players
slumped. Sammie Ellis, team
leading scorer, hit only one of six

shots‘ from the ﬂoor, and ﬁnished"

with ﬁve points before fouling out
of the game in the second half.

Pitt’s most consistent and
dependable player this year,
Carlton Neverson, scored 18
points, including a short jump shot
which gave Pitt a 48-47 lead which
it wasn’t to relinquish. 8'

For the night, Pitt could connect
on only 36 percent of its shots, but
after two tough losses, all they.
wanted was a win, and come
season’s finish, when tournament
bids are extended, representatives

could care less about who and by
how ‘much you beat a team. All
that counts is the won-loss record.
Tonight at the Field House, Pitt"

hosts little Westminster College.

The game takes on an added
meaning because it will mark the
return of former Pitt basketball

ﬁx
in

Coach Buzz Ridl, now the athletic r

director at Westminster.

Ridl came to Pitt in 1968 when
the Pitt basketball fortunes were at
a distinct low. 7’ When he left after
1975, he had produced two
consecutive tournament teams, the
25-4 NCAA Eastern Regional
Finalist team in 1974, and the 18-11
team which went to the quarter
ﬁnals of the National Invitational
Tournament in 1975'. ’

Westminster has ‘ been a long
time ‘NAIA power, and went 22-4 .
last season. But graduation losses
were heavy, and Coach Ron
Galbreath’s team is struggling this
year. Westminster lost to Point
Park.

To describe Pitt’s wrestling

word, it would have to be hectic.

Saturday. Last, but probably least,
Pitt withstood a 32-4 setback
against the Terrapins of Maryland.

It would appear then that
Panther head coach Rande Stottle-
meyer and his team would welcome
the three days .off prior to
tomorrow’s match against Millers-
ville State College.

“Well, we're trying to lick our
wounds and heal some of our
injuries,” said Stottlemeyer, “but
we’ll try to be-as prepared as we
can for Millersville and Lock
Haven.” ' -

Although Pitt trumped Millers-
ville last year 25-11, Stottlemeyer
is in no wayoverlooking them.

“There’s no doubt that Millers-
ville’ is going to hustle us. We're
not just going to step out on‘ the

trauma to think seriously about a pro career. »

“They’re pretty solid the whole
way up, said Stottlemeyer. We
won’t be ableto rely on just one or
two wrestlers, we’ll need everyone
in our line-up—all ten men.”

Two big pluses that have come

along with the victories last’

weekend are the return of two
injured Panther starters, Glenn
Maxwell and Mike Bond. Maxwell
came back after the Lehigh match,
while Bond returned against
Syracuse.

According to the Panther head
coach, some of the more important
weight match-ups against Millers-

heavyweight.

- Sammie Ellis Adjusted

Looks for ‘Eight Title

By ANNE OSIPER
Pitt News Staff Writer

To thousands of Pitt basketball
fans, the tall slim ﬁgure of Sammie
Ellis hitting a ﬁfteen-footer from
the base line has become a familiar
sight. I

Like many I future stars, his

talents went undetected when he

was cut from his school’s basket-
ball team as an eighth-grader. The
following year, Ellis’s basketball
'career‘began in earnest. In his
junior and senior years, the
McCrae, Ga. native, helped the

Telfair County»High School team to .

27-2 and 24-3 records, respectively.

Both years, Telfair County finished

third in the state. ..
Next, Ellis went on to,play ball_at

‘Middle Georgia Junior College,

which won the Georgia State Junior
College Championship and went on
to the Nationals. -

Georgia is a long way from
Pittsburgh, so why did he choose
‘Pitt? ..

“I wanted to play ball in the east
arrd I wanted to go -somewhere I
could step right in as a junior and
help the team;” sais Ellis. “Right
now I think I couldn’t have made a
better choice.‘ I think we have as
good a chance as anybody to make
it to the tournament.

“It took me a while to adjust to
the weather but the people are the
same here as they are back home,
the senior added. “All the guys on
the team are really close.” ’

Head Coach Tim Gr'gurich’s,
guiding hand is greatly appreciated
by Ellis. -

“He’s a good coach. He’s helped

me alot with fundamentals to make ‘

my game even better, ‘he said.
“Fran Webster, Cleve Edwards,
the whole coaching staff is good.”

The basketball team has practice
every day for two to three hours. _

uring practice, the team works on
its various presses: 2-3, 1-3-1, and
2-2-1.- The .team_ usually uses a
man-to-man defense.

“In man-to-man, everyone has to
help the weak side. You help out
the weak side because you know
sometime you’ll need help your-
self,” he said.

What about offense?

“I’m nice on the baseline,” Ellis
said. “The baseline is good

because you can either drive or
shoot and I can drive and shoot
with both hands.”

Ellis, who is attending Pitt on a
full basketball scholarship, is
planning on getting a degree in
business.

“My most important goal _is to
play pro ball. I think I could play
either forward or guard in the pros
because I ca-n rebound well
underneath and I can handle the
ball outside,” he said. “It 'doesn’t_
really matter which position I play
as long as I get a chance to play.”

Ellis’s most memorable moment
was when he .received the Most
Valuable Player Award during the
Connecticut Mutual Classis. He
-scored forty-seven points in two
games as the Panthers won _the

"Classic. Free throws played a key
role in the‘ outcome of the
tournament and Ellis hit clutch free
throws in the ﬁnal minutes.

‘fI’m not ' nervous when I’m
taking free throws. I don’t hear the
fans, I just concentrate on "the
basket,” said Ellis._ g

. Concerning the latter part of the
season, he said, ‘ *1 think we’ll get it

all together and play better ball. All’

of the upcoming games are
important because a win is a win,
but the league games are the most
important because there are a lot of
good teams in our league.”
Having ‘five brothers and five
sisters, Ellis is used to having
someone cheering him on. Accord-
-ing to Ellis, the large Pitt. crowds
help a lot. . '
“Both this year and

J‘?

last yeaazﬁ

there have been great crowds,”~

Ellis said. “It’s great the way the
people of Pittsburgh stand by the
team.” .
