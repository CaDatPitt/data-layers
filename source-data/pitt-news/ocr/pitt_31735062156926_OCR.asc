At their recent meeting, it was

sociation, if they. desire, will par-
ticipate on the panel.

This action was admittedly tak-
en with the recent criticisms -of
Congress lethargy in mind. Stu-
dent feeling in .certain quarters
has run high concerning the pro-
posal as it changes the balance
of power from balanced represen-
tation to a ten-to-five ratio in
favor of the men.

Originally, the amendment came
to Congress as a petition from
the student body with approxi-
mately ‘600 signatures on it.

No organization or group of or-
ganizations was given credit for
fostering the bill, according to

"George ’Lynn, ' president of Con-

In the face of criticism for “being a tool of the adrnini.<;tration”
and lethargic, Student Congress is taking measures forwbeneﬁt of the

student body.

Before an audience consisting of one lone student, the members
of Congress registered disappointment over the fact that students
will not be represented at a coming meeting of University admin-
istrative oflicials reviewing the policy of the school concerning poli-

tical speakers.

Frank Blackstone felt that the student body, through -Congress,
should have someone to present student views. His opinion seemed to
meet with the approval of the rest of the Conggrcss for an effort,

' This week, Student Congress put through
one of its,most prized bills, the» Pitt Chest.
Certainly, the Congress deserves praise for its
prompt work on a ticklish job. George Lynn,
Mr. President of the student legislature, along
with his committee, spent much” time and
thought before presenting the plan to Congress.

As such, the proposed Pitt Chest will re-
move incessant demands on the pockets of the
student. It incorporates all campus wide drives
into one unit. On the basis of past compilations,
the money collected from this one drive will
be allotted to the various groups. Evidence
shows that thissystem has been advantageous

' to all groups on other campuses.

Congress has made another step forward.‘
With the origination of the athletic probe, es-
tablishment of relations with NSA, and an in-
telligent attempt to correct a muddled publicity
situation on campus, this year ’s group sparkles

‘ in comparison.

C Try Chapel

Heinz Chapel services are non-denomina-
tional. No particular creed is preached, unless
it be the creed of living a good life. Somehow,
we eel that even college students might bene-
ﬁt from adopting such ‘a creed. The speakers
are all persons of recognized standing in their
ﬁelds, while the subjects of the talks arechosen

V ‘particularly with student appeal in mind.

Add_to these the chapel choir and the or-

gan music and you have a half hour that for ‘

knowledge and quiet relaxation cannot be
matched anywhere on the campus.

At smaller universities and colleges, away

»from the noisy metropolitan districts, the

_DonEw

chapel and its services are a source of com-

V plete pleasure to the students. They are a very

important. part of their college life. There is
no reasongwhy this cannot be solhere.

what Independent ideals should

on the basis of my experience
during the years 1940-43.

I References to difﬁculties with
the administration were with re;
gard to my own undergraduate
days about which I have knowl-
edge—'as to present conditions of

' University policy I am not quali-

ﬁed to speak.

However, the same deﬁciencies
in facilities, the same lackadaisi-
cal disinterested attitude exists
today in your Student Congress
as it existed in my days in our
student government. 0

Lack Facilities

As to deﬁciencies, I refer to the
lack of recreational space (this is
not the same as social facilities
though closely related) game
rooms, card rooms,’ light athletics
such as ping pong, billiards and
bowling, adequate light lunch fa-
cilities. All the things that go
with Student Unions, of which we
have nothing, not even an unsat-
isfactory substitute.

We did not want, nor can you
expect to have an imposing stu-
dent‘ union building in your day;
BUT, .there should be an effort to
provide some. TEMPORARY fa-
cilities. We ‘should be able to say,
weltried; it was not possible; Can
we say that? A recommended
place for temporary union facili-
ties is the banquet hall of the
Soldier 8: Sailors Memorial, which
goes unused most of the daylight
hours; or the social room of the
Stephen Foster Memorial. Y

Frat Control Lethargic

It appeared then, as it seems
to be now that for some’ reason
fraternity controlled student gov-
ernment is lethargic, disinterested
and unwilling to bring up cogent

quiring action on the part of the
administration.

Now this matter of bucking the
administration is one which is
too often misunderstood by those
outside looking in and also by
those inside dealing with the ad-
ministration. It is my feeling that
the ills as to student welfare at
the University are not the fault
of the administration. They may
be at fault for not coping. with it

Last Caution

One last caution, to Independ-

more can be accomplished through
Va‘ clear, concise, concrete plan,

‘New Look’ Shorf
For Indian Miss

_PALTO ALTO, Calif. (IP) -
Even if American women ﬁnally
solve their great controversy of
ankle length, knee length, and
points-in-between lengths for their
hemlines, they will still be in-
correct, according to Miss Meha
Yodh, 20, first Indian woman stu-
dent to enroll at Stanford Univer-
sity. '

“The length for a lady’s dress,
if she cares to be truly correct as
well as feminine, is ﬂoor length,”
the black-eyed Miss Yodh said.

A Hindu of Brahmin caste, Miss
Yodh intends to stick to her tra-
ditional Indian dress during her
stay in the United States-—with
the hemline of her gracefully drap-
ed magenta and gold sari sweep-
ing"the ground. ~

Stiff Drills Prep
Pitt for Opener

Culminating a week of stiff drills
and a light workout Thursday, Dr.
H. C. Carlson prepared his 1947-
48 edition of the Pitt basketball
squad for their season opener Fri-
day against Wisconsin.

“Civil war” battles between the
squads raged throughout the prac-
tice sessions as the ﬁght for reg-
ular berths continued.

The ﬁve survivors of the com-
petition will start against the
Badgers tonight. Bill Cieply and
Dodo Canterna will go at forward,
newcomer Mort Lerner at center,
and Ed Latagliata and -Sammy
David at guard. Cieply and Latag-
liata are co-captains.

Monday evening the Panthers
held the last of their pre-season
practice games when they met the
Altoona r,Ed.wards, local profes-
sional team, at the Stadium Gym.

' The game was‘ used by the Pitt-

men to develop their under-the-
basket attack and no long back-
court shots were tried.

’ Although restricted in their
shots, the cagers were able to keep
astride the Edwards until the ﬁnal
whistle. They were vanquished by
a two-point margin, 47-45.

Au Benefits of College

Education Available Free

by Lois Sidler

How would you like to go to
college without spending a single
penny for tuition?

Several students at Pitt have
devised a way of getting a com-
pletely free education without
having _any required home-work.
Furthermore, they miss the hectic
rush at registration.

The students believe that with
classe§ so large as they are at Pitt,
a person not registered could at-
tend lectures and remain unnotic-
ed. No one, as far as can be as-
certained, has tried the system,
but it appears workable.

Let us take the hypothetical
case'of Joe Smoe. Joe could have
attended classes in biology, so-
ciology, psychology, history, and

many of the other large lecture
sections during the fall semester.

Joe could buy his books at the
bookstore and “cut” classes on

 

days of exams. He would have
unrestricted use of the Tuck
shops, the Mess hall, the libraries,
the smokers, and could attend al-
most all assemblies.

Mr. S., however, could not cash
his checks at the treasurer’s office,
take out library books, obtain an
activities card, or belong to any
school organiations. He would not
receive any credit or get a de-
gree.

He could mingle with .the stu-
dents on the lawn or in the Tuck
shops. Joe could even play bridge
on the twelfth oor, sip tea in the
Commons room, and sharpen his
pencils in the information room.

It remains a mystery if there
is a Joe Smoe, although certainly
it is possible that there could be
one. ‘Look around in your classes,
especially the large lectures. Per-
haps he’s that nondescript char-
acter with the horn-rimmed
glasses and the red tie sitting be-
side you.

Indiana Protessor_\B;ewails
Labor's Political Position

BLOOMINGTON, Ind.—Improvement of the political and eco-

nomic status of labor in. the U. S.

is hampered by the fact that the

average American worker is not content to improve his own posi-
tion in labor, but wants to get out of the labor category altogether.

This was the View expressed

by Prof. Roy V. Peel, of the de-

partment of government at Indiana university, in a meeting of the

AVC in Town hall here.

“Only a few can get to the top,”¢

Mr. Peel said. “Most railroad
crossing watchmen never get to be
president of the railroad.”

Prof. Peel cited the role of la-
bor in the Scandinavian countries
as ample evidence that the worker
can be an important member of his
society, both socially and polit-
ically. In Sweden, he said, metal
workers. and carpenters have an
enviable standard of living and

are an integral part of their com- .

munities.
Prof. Peel said that labor can

become a strong political faction.

only by instituting a strong educa-
tional program for labor itself.
“We have a School of Business
on ,,this campus,” he continued,
“but we don’t have El’ school of la-
bor.”
He added that labor should form

a strong political party. Gallup
poll results indicate, Prof. Peel
said, that neither the general pub-
lic nor labor itself favors using
labor funds for partisan political
purposes, but a strong labor party

with its own money could do much
toward improving the position of
labor. .
