Rege Cordic, Pitt sophomore,
member of the Panther Magazine
staff, and radio announcer for
WWSW, has distinguished him-
self in another ﬁeld——the stage.

The versatile Cordic is making
his ﬁrst appearance in the Pitts-
burgh Playhouse production of
“Command Decision.” In this
play, Rege portrays Sgt. Evans,
the tart-tongued General’s aide
who has ﬁnished his gunner’s mis-
sions, and has taken a job as the
General’s man to improve his own
food, drink, and amusements.

His performance in “Command
Decision” earned him exceptional
notices from the critics. “The best
role in the play, that of sardonic,
‘wise-cracking Tech Sgt. Evans,,
gets a crack going-over from Mr.
Regis Cardic.' He gets all the jokes’
and never misses a beat” (Cohen,
Post—Gazette) . i

“As Sgt. Evans, young Cordic
is especially gratifying and we
cheer him without reservations”
(Ward, Press).

Rege is also one of the import-
ant, cogs in the wheel-of: the

- Panther Magazine. He is a mem-

ber of the art staff and one of the
‘chief contributors to the Panther
Overseas Rage.

gives Pitt student Regis Cordic a chance to show his versatile
talents to theatre-goers ‘throughout the city of Pittsburgh.

again pinned his Tech opponent.
He did it in 1:38 of the ﬁrst round.

Snow Drives  Rusebnllers Inside,

 _..~".V-/ ._

Coach Ralph (Sarge) Mitterling last week began to carve

away at the outer edges of a 65-man baseball turnout. Several -

pitchers and ﬁelders were included in the list of men dropped

from the squad so far.

The ﬁrst outdoor workout was held by The Sarge ‘on W/Ved-
nesday in the stadium, but rain and snow drove his “boys"
back to the bullpen under the Stadium Thursday and Friday.

Mitterling hopes to hold the ﬁrst‘-r

intra—squad game sometime this
week. It will give him his ﬁrst
real look at the team. since spring
training began two weeks ago.
One or two new men showed pos-
sibilities at the plate during Wed-
nesday’s practice, driving several
pitches high into the Stadium
stands. '

The early cuts in the squad are
necessary, Mitterling said, in or-
der that players more developed
would not beheld back and thus-
ly retard the collective develop-

,ment of the team.

The opening game with Waynes—
burg at the ‘Stadium. on April 9
is less than a month away.

Du Pont research has

available to industry what may :be-
come one of America’s key structural _ ‘
materials, titanium metal. Midway
in density between aluminum and
iron and with an especially high
melting point, silvery-white titanium
olfers an extraordinary combination
of strength, lightness, corrosion

sistance and hardness.

Titanium is the ninth most com-
mon element. But it has been slow
in coming into its own as a metal be-
cause of the diﬁiculty of separating
it in pure form from its ores.

Du Pont scientists ﬁrst began to
probe the possibilities of metallic ti-
tanium in the course of their long
experience with the titanium oxide
pigments. Their research was inter-
rupted by World War II. Meanwhile,
the U.S. Bureau of Mines laborato-
ries succeeded in producing the metal

for research purposes.
