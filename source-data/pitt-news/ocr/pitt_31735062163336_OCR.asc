to the metropolitan university it now is,” responded with only two
words to the explanation, at last Monday's SU Forum Series’ Ad-
ministrative Coﬂfee Hour, that nothing can be done about leveling
curbs for wheel chair students because the city —of Pittsburgh will
not approve the project. _. '

“Why not?” Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld retorted.

“If someone wanted to take an automobile up there, there
wouldn’t be any trouble at all; but if it's a student in a wheel chair,
it’s a problem of pedestrian safety!

‘‘I wouldn’t give up on this problem,” Litchﬁeld prompted.

Questioned on Discrimination ~

Besides the possibility of installing more mechanical devices to
aid handicapped students, the Chancellor was questioned at the Coffee
Hour about steps taken by the University to stop discrimination on
the campus and in “the University City,” as Litchﬁeld prefers to
call the Oakland area. 

“If there is any discrimination here, I wish someone would

Speaks ‘Today,

Bernard Maggin, an aeronautic-

o‘f‘the Associate Administration of
National Aeronautics and Space

The address will be in Soldiers

vmorrow..Dr. A. C. Ackenheil, a
professor in the Civil Engineering

audience of 1500 engineers.

Maggin will talk about the role
of engineers in the space pro-
grams of today and tomorrow. The
title of his speech is “The Na-
tional Aeronautics and Space Ad-
ministration’s Space Flight Pro-
gram.”

2, Wayne University Grad V

He is a graduate of Wayne Uni-
versity, and is connected with the
overall aspect of NASA Technical
Programs.

These p r o g r a m s include:
Space Orbital Rendezvous, the
lunar mission, the life sciences,
and a manned space platform.

From 1942 to 1947, Maggin was

Committee on Aeronautics . (NA-
CA), working in the Langley Field
aeronautics lab. ’

Worked on Technical Programs
From 1947 to 1958, he worked

dealing . with the aerodynamics

missiles.

In 1958 he joined NASA, and
worked with the Flight Me-
cha-nics Group, involved with
manned and unmanned space
craft. He continued in this ca-
pacity until l961, when he as-
sumed his present position ‘with
NASA. '

Or Ackenheil pointed out that
Congressman James G. Fulton, a
member of the House Space Com-
mittee, was largely responsible for
setting up this engagement.

Ackenheil also said that plans,
to get one of the astronauts to
speak were thwarted by the fact
that they are not allowed to make
any public speaking engagements.

E&M Cabinet
Changes all Ball
To Fall ixer

This year the Engineering and
Mines Cabinet has transformed its
annual Fall Ball into the Fall
Mixer to be held in the Student
Union Ballroom on October 25
from 8:30 to 12:30 p.m..

, The E&M Cabinet has initiated
these changes in an effort to im-_
prove the low attendance of pre-
vious years by trying to make the
dance more appealing to the stu-
dents.

-To eliminate the transporta-
~ tion problems that holding the
event off campus proposes for
resident students as well as for

commuters, and to brin g the
freshmen into closer contact
with the members of their de-
partment, the dance has been

moved to the more readily ac-
cessible Student Union.

By making it a more informal
affair, dates will not be necessary.
While men will be charged a fee

mitted free. Girls from the sur-
rounding schools have also been

to bring dates.

‘tending the Fall Mixer the parking
lot across from the SU will be

10 Teams Argue F ecieral Obligation to Education

/ WPDU Opens Season

\

‘ﬁfo

The ﬁrst intercollegiate de
this area will be conducted
Union with the University’s

bate tournament of the year in
this Saturday in the Student
William Pitt Debating Union

acting as host, according to WPDU president, James Joseph.
Teams from ten colleges and universities will debate the
national intercollegiate topic for 1963-64: “Resolved, that the

education to all qualiﬁed high
school graduates.”

The University of Akron, Ball
State College (Indiana), West-
minster College, University of
West Virginia, Chatham College,
Duquesne University, C l a r i 0 n
S t a t e College (Pennsylvania),
Penn State (Men's Division),
Johnstown campus, and four
WPDU teams will participate.

Debating affirmative for WPDU
will be Dorothy Kiefer and Ted
Danielson, James Moyer and
Merrily Kodis, Alan Kaufman and
Bonnie Meikrantz, and Jean
O'Hara and Carolyn Tira. '

The negative teams will con-
sist of Carol Szolis and Carol
Durant, Wolf Swoboda and Tom
Zaucha, Al Vescio and Michael
Smith, Wolf Swoboda and Tom
Zaucha, Al Vescio and Michael
Smith, and Gerald Dzura and
Marty Engels.

The ﬁrst of the four rounds will
begin at 9:30 a.m. Room assign-
ments for the clashes will be post-
ed at the tournament headquar-
ters, Dining Room A, SU. The

' debates are open to the public.

Cross-Examination Style. '-
J The tournament will be con-
ducted in cross-examination style,
which is rather unique in inter-
collegiate debating. “We” are one

- of only two or three universities

in the country that use the ‘cross-

.antee an opportunity for highei¢

examination A s t yl e consistently,
and one of the half dozen that use
it at all,” remarked Joseph.

“The style we use approaches
more of a legal format, almost
touching on a British type de-
bating,” he continued-

In the more widely used ortho-
dox style, the presentation con-
sists of ten-minute arguments by
both speakers on both sides; and
the rebuttal, of ﬁve-minute argu-
ments by allthe speakers.

Th e cross-examination style
differs from this in that each pre-
sentation is only eight minutes,
followed by four minutes of cross-
questioning by the opposing team.
The rebuttal lasts only ﬁve min-
utes for each team, rather than
the ten minutes allowed by the
orthodox style. _

The advantage of the cross-
examination style, according’ to
Joseph, is that it requires a de-
bater to be better informed on

— the topic in order to react spon-
taneously under questioning‘.

The cross examination period is
“crucial” in a lot of debates, Jos-
eph claims, “You may get an ad-
mission from the other team un-
der cross examination that com-
pletely unravels them,” he ex-
plained.

1 Alumni Groups VVant Dry Facts

 

" (Continued from Page 1)
University a “traditionally dry
campus,” and it was “understood
this applied to the fraternities.”

It read in part: L

—Alcoholic beverages. shall
not be sold or served to stu-
dents under the age of 21 on
any property of the University
or at any University-sponsored
meeting or function . . .

——Fraternal organizations_ re-
cognized by the University are ex-
pected to observe the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
in the conduct of their social af-
fairs. Failure to observe the‘-laws
governing the furnishing or giv-
ing alcoholic beverages to any
minor may result in the discon-
tinuance of recognition of the or-
ganization and disciplinary action
against its _members.

.Unwise To Drink
“I certainly t ink it unwise for
members (of raternities) under
21 to drink,” said Dr. Rankin.
When asked if he has received
any complaints from neighbors
of fraternity houses, Dr. Rankin
pointed out that. his oﬁice has
received none.

Mark Bebko, president of Inter-
fraternity Council, was quietly re-
served in his comment On the
matter. He said:

V No Issue
. “As long as the University has
not changed its stand, We have
no issue to discuss.”

Bebko stated an IFC policy
was drafted to go into effect
this fall would be adhered to.
The policy is in compliance with
University regulations regard-
ing the use of alcoholic bever-
ages. Fraternal organiaations
recognized by the University, it
says, are expected to observe
the laws of the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania in conducting
their social affairs. .1

It further speciﬁes that alco-
holic beverages shall be restricted
to weekends, which “shall be
construed to mean the time be-
tween 4:30 p.m. to 1 a.m. Friday

and noon Saturday to 1 a.m. Sun-
day to 1 a.m. Sunday of the same
weekend.” * '

Must Drink Downstairs
According to the policy, use of
alcoholic beverages will be con-
ﬁned to the interior of the fra-
ternity house below the second

ﬂoor. No alcoholic beverages are
to be served at rush functions. ‘

Violations of the IFC policy
ruling are subject to ﬁnes, social
probation, dismissal from par-
ticipation in IFC activities by
vote of council and dismissal
from campus by University
authorities. ‘

As stipulated, the IFC policy is
intended for those fraternity
houses in which the use of alco-
holic beverages is permitted.

Enwright Comments
Parker Enwright, assistant dean
of men and fraternity adviser,

commented: ~

“C e r t a i n l y the individual
housing corporations (fraternal
landlords) could restrict drink-
ing in houses if'they so wished.”
He explained that the matter
of drinking was one to be settled

Second Letter Follows ,

On the heels of the letter from
the TAlumni Association to Dr.
Rankin -came another letter, this
one authored by Chzfrles H.
Boehm, superintendent of public
instruction. .It emphasized. a
crackdown on procuration and
consumption of alcoholic bever-
ages by minors.

Act 465, now section 675.1 of
the Penal Code reads: ' “

It is “unlawful for a person
less than 21 years of age to at-
tempt to purchase, consume,
possess or to transport any alco-
hol, liquor or malt or brewed
beverages within the Common-
wealth.”

The letter warns that any per-
son violating provisions of this
law shall, upon ‘conviction, be
sentenced to pay a ﬁne or not less
than $25 nor more than $100 and
costs of prosecution; or he may
undergo imprisonment for a term
not exceeding 30 days, or both.

Once in a Tree will be held this
evening in Room, 1126, CL. at
8:30. Dr. Barbara ., McIntyre, di-
rector of the Theater describes
the production" as_ “unusual.”

“This particular show will pre-

sent" a departure from our usual
routine. In the past we have
toured our children’s plays to the
handicapped Within t h e- Pitts-
burgh area. This season, however,
we are going to hold every plier-
formance of our play in Step en
Foster Memorial.”

Dr’. McIntyre continued, “We
are playing at Foster ‘because.
we feel it is ‘time , once again
for a production of our Chil-
dren’s Theater Division to draw
far flung communities we
tour back towards the center
from’ which our services emen-
ate. During our travels last year
many people asked us «how our
shows fare when presented at

- Foster.

“Indeed, certain oﬁicials V from
the schools of the handicapped
we travel to requested that we
do a show at ‘Foster so that their
boys and girls could make" the
trip in to see what a real theater
looked like.” V ~

She added that “since there
may be children involved in the
play itself, rehearsals will last
only as late as 9 p.m.,” assur-
ing those who are concerned with

‘overloading their academic sched-

ule that Once in a, ‘Tree will not
take up excessive time.

Coffee Without Meat

 

Well, the Chancellor came to speak to the student body
on Monday in the Student Union and was greeted: with a
nice crowd and a nice hand. Unfortunately, that was about

The questions which the program committee prepared
in advance were only intended as -an introduction, and it

lwas up to the students to carry the discussion from there.

No one, howeverﬁ saw ﬁt to carry anything.

Of course, it did have one or two interesting moments.
The ﬁrst came when someone asked, about the amount of
freedom which students should be permitted at an in-

nstitution like the University: “Is there a state law which
requires females to be in the dormatory at a speciﬁc hour?”.

This brought gales of laughter and a hundred straining
necks as students turned to stare at Dean Helen Poole
Rush, the person to whdm the question was really directed.

Dean Rush, however, laughed it off and replied that
she would answer such questions on November 11 when
she would be the guest of honor.

From that point, the discussion went on to less speciﬁc

problems until a handicapped girl asked what things were

being done to further assist the crippled -students in the
school. ,

The Chancellor referred the question to Dr. Alan C.
Rankin, assistant chancellor for student and general affairs,
who is head of a committee appointed to investigate the
problem. The Chancellor was stunnedjbylhis reply that the
city would not permit certain improvements to be made.

Discrimination was brought up, but the questions were

once again of too general a nature ‘to be of any real in-

terest. There was a veiled reference to Dean Rush, but Dr.
Litchﬁeld did not catch the implication. And that wa
about the extent of the coffee hour. _ '
The problem with the whole affair was that no one
asked any speciﬁc questions. It was all too general. There
was no meat to the meeting. Except for the one question
by the handicapped girl, and the discreet arrows at Dean

Rush, there was nothing said which could not be read in“

some University report.

We can only hope that students will come to the next _

coffee hour featuring Dean Rush with prepared questions
which will add a little more life and interest to the proceed-
ings. ’ I

The rah-rah football . era is dying —
thank God. Won’t somebody please bury it?
The dignity of a school no longer reposes

in the right arm of "a quaiterback. And the
height of student creative achievement is

no longer manifested in a few vivid obsceni— .
. ties scrawled on a stadium wall. Universities are

no longer evaluated in the trivial terms of yard-
age gained and touchdowns scored. The rah-rah
age is dying.

But it is not yet dead. Although barred from
trustees’ meetings and locked
out of administrators’- offices, -the
aura of the era will not sulk off
to some corner‘ to die in peace.

Like the banished dictator
not content to waste away from 1:
sclerosis in some Florida cock— ;
tail lounge I on expropriated "
funds, it tyrannizes over one last
stronghold in the mountains. Its
demands that value be measured
with a yardage-stick are still .
complied with there. Won’t.
somebody please bury the dictator esconced in the
Mountains of School Spirit? '

As long as the height of School Spirit is mea-

, sured by the number of arms uplifted in a"‘.Pitt

tunnel” through which the football players run
onto the ﬁeld, the rah-rah era will still wield its
yardage-stick sceptor. As long as school spirit is
considered synonymous with a hoarse voice or is
confused with the spirits that come out of a fifth
secreted into the stadium, the last rites of the
rah-rah era’s frivolous value—standard will be
postponed.

Still Useful _

The rah-rah yardage stick is still, of course, a
useful measuring device —- as long as one re-
members not to try to measure pounds with a
ruler. As a measure of student enthusiasm‘ for the
football team, it is a good standard; but surely
school spirit transcends confetti throwing.

Some students may not like football. Is this
to imply they don’t like the University? Some
students do not delight in stomping their feet and

yelling themselves hoarse. Is this to imply that
they don’t delight in their University?

Students with limited amounts of free time
may prefer spending it tutoring a high school stu-
dent so that he will be able to graduate, rather
than spending it painting a panther on a sheet
and yelling “Go, Pitt, Go!” Is this to imply that
they lack school spirit?

_ ‘Of course many students here do lack school
spirit. But they are not merely to becriticized
for lack of enthusiasm over the football team.
Why not criticize them as _well for notsupporting
the soccer team, or for not taking pride in an
outstanding debate union, or for not buying ,3
yearbook? ‘ V

Other Criteria _

Why not criticize them for answering “Why?”
when they’re asked to buy" a_' copy of Ideas and
Figures? Or for lack of interest in University
Or for not being proud
of their school? Or for not urging their parents
to attend Parents’? Weekend if ‘ they live within a
reasonable distance? Or for indifference to. aca-
demic excellence? Or for not listening to WPGH
or attending Forum Series programs?‘ Or for not
serving on the Undergraduate Committee?

Why should the student who cheers for the

- football team be lauded for his school spirit above

the student who works for the Hill Educational

Project? Why should we feel more praised when

an outsider points to a packed cheering section
than when he remarks that we have a responsible
student body concerned with the problems of the
community and the world? .

Of course there is too much passivity at the
football games. But the real problem is that there’
is too much_— "passivity everywhere.
school spirit is not evidenced by students’ refusal
"to cheer those who represent the University well,
but rather by their refusal to represent the Uni-
Spirit trophies should
really be awarded to those students who are
awakening to their responsibilities.

vThe rah-rah football era is dying. Why not
bury it? Why not criticize students for not caring
about their responsibilities_and about the Uni-
versity, rather than for not caring about the
football team? / ‘

Spirit of Responsibility . . .

   Hide and Seek  

I guess you might call me the typical
transfer student. It took me two to three
‘weeks to ﬁnd my way to class without the
aid of my student invoice. I, too, have
found the library maze befuddling.

And, of course, there is that one moment
of realization —— that subtle indication which
strikes with the impact of a Webster’s Unabridged
dropped from the top ﬂoor of the Cathedral --
that tells a newcomer everything is not on the up-
and-up in administrative circles. .

An aura? of top-level apathy
pervades._

When a VIP calls the ofﬁce
of'a certain administrator and
the latter’s secretary asks her
taskmaster if he chooses to be
“in today” or not, one begins to
draw a sneaky suspicion all that
glitters‘ is not a generality. In a
pleasant, rehearsed monotone,
the secretary informs the caller ..
that “Dr. islnot in
today; _I’m sorry.” And her sorrow lasts about as
long as a collegian’s paycheck on registration day.
Secret Entrances _ ~

Then there are those administrators who dally
with the idea of secret entrances to their working
chambers. Hence, they are able to conduct a
shuttel system, taking. in and excusing guests via
the “back door,” while their 10' o’clock appoint-

modic babbling of a_ secretary (or two).

Jack_B. Critchﬁeld (not to be confused with
Litchﬁeld), director of student aid, is an adminis-
trator. He is’ respected by students and faculty
alie kfor what he is, a sincere individual who
speaks his piece even if the ‘truth should hurt.

“And the truth is,” said Critchﬁeld, “that some
administrators are unable to give their undivided
attention to student channels simply because of
the C0mP1eXity aild bigness of the University --
or because some just don’t show interest.”

In dropping. -his verbal sudgel on the wall

existing between administration and students,‘

Critchﬁeld said he himself might have to plead v_

guilty to some student accusations. But at least
he is making an attempt to salve constrained rela-

tions between administration and students and

administration et al.

Through Cﬂhcmnels

I’ve-come to accept the fact that to do any-
thing at the University requires noe’s going
through channels. What makes things interesting
(and at times perplexing) are the myriad of ways
the University family selects to botch things up.
Can we honestly ask ourselves which is worse:

Getting caught in a revolving ‘door, or being"

maneuvered about in a vicious circle?

It seems satiating that the University can be
patterned somewhat after the military in opera-
tion( no offense to Uncle Sam) and still maintain

' a deﬁnite pattern of Ivy League costs. At least

it’s gratifying to know that my tuition money is
watering the University lawns. ’

I’ve yet to see a University student (transfer
or otherwise) plucking petals out of a daisy and
muttering to’ himself, “The University loves me;
she loves me not.” But then again there aren’t too
many daisies to be found in Oakland.

Something keeps gnawing at me; it seems to
be saying, “I pledge my allegiance to the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh.” And to its administration, its
faculty, its students, its classrooms, its green
grass, its bulging till, and more.

And I repeat, “I do.”_

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Grad Student Defends

‘Not Guilty'_ Column

The Editor, The Pitt News:

Stan‘ Stein’s_ column “Not
Guilty," in the September 23
edition of The Pitt News, is a
ﬁne example of the kind of
clear, sensible thinking needed‘
at the present time.

Like Mr. Stein, I honestly
feel I have done what I can
to make our society free and
open to all./That I have not
been completely successful is
quite obvious, but I am trying.
I have chosen to be a Christian,
with all that implies, especially
insofar as my neighbor is).con-
cerned. It goes without saying, '
then, that I want to see justice
and equality accomplished for

_both Negro and -White, as well

as others. .
I empathize with the. man

‘whose name nobody knows,

and, in e an individual way, I
hope I can help to make things
better for him. But I cannot
successfully do this if I must
carry around a burdenof guilt.
In the ﬁrst place, I don’t feel

guilty, and, in_the second place, I

I thing this society of ours could E
do well with fewer feelings of
guilt and more feelings of con-
ﬁdence, conﬁdence to achieve‘
marvellous things for all citizens.
It would be convenient to ﬁnd
so vast a scapegoat as an entire
race for all the ills which beset
another race, but it isn’t real-
istic, nor is it fair to blame an

entire people for the crimes of a

few.

I strongly- feel that it is for
all those who are in favor of
freedom and equality to stand
up and be counted, and I think
also that it is time to stop blam-
ing others for one’s faults. Fi-
nally, and before it is too late,
I think it is time to work to-.
gether to make our wonderful
country, and our world pleas-
anter and nicer in which to live,

-and I mean really live!

The Editor, The Pitt News: ’

, Marvin Zelko'witz’s' r e c ent
c o l u In n entitled “Professional
Loafers,” which paints the life
of the. D.P.W. recipient to be
a “bed of roses,” is a grave dis-
tortion of the facts and ﬁgures.
I have never heard of a D.P.W.
recipient with a wife and two
children being allotted $60 per
week, or $240 per month. Per-
haps if this were true, such
families might make their homes
in decent dwellings where they
could provide their growing

‘ children with a healthy diet.

Your assumption seems to be
that these people are content
with their lot, which may in-

,clude sub—standard h 0 u s i n g ,

poor employment opportunities,
unhealthy diets, p oor medical
care, and” many other disadvan-

. tages which you and I are for-

tunate .enough to have bypassed
by some saving grace.
Ah, my friend, one salient

point you do present. It’s‘true,
proportionate reductions a r e
'- made from a recipient’s check if
he is able to ‘earn more than

ance because part-time work
which could lead to full-time

-employment is discouraged and

the recipient is forced ‘to be
maintained‘ on a subsistance in-
come.

You devote your entire article
to destructively criticizing the
efforts of the D.P.W. Perhaps
you_ might h a v e accomplished
something by offering some con-
structive innovations. For_ a

Social, Work

Zelkowitz Rapped
By LA Senior‘

The Editor, _The_ Pitt News:

It_ seems that The Pitt News
editorial staff has once. again
taken a stand on an item that
they know very little about.
Such appears to be the case with
Mr. Zelkowitz’s article entitled:
D.P.A. Vacation. With Pay —-
Professional Loafers.

As a member of the Univer-
sity community, u p on what
sources have you based your ob-
servations and statements? Have
you.ever had any‘ contact or
dealings with people on D_PA
or are your ideas and opinions
those of most uninformed peo-
ple regarding the ﬁeld of public
welfare?

I am /not denying that a “new
breed” of people has come into
existence as a result of our
democratic system, or that there

‘are chislers on the relief rolls.‘

What I am trying to do is in-
form a seemingly uninformed
member of the University.

In case Mr. Zelkowitz doesn’t
know or _didn’t bother to ﬁnd
out, the D.P.A. allowance for a
single person over 18 is $69

A monthly. This is about one—half

of your $35 weekly ﬁgure. Did

‘you’ ever stop to think how far

$17 a. week goes when you have
to eat, sleep, and cloth yourself?
Do you happen to know one of
the basic eligibility requirements
for D.P.A.iis that you must ac"-

tively seek and accept any em-.

ployment offeredtq you? The al-
ternative to this is discontinu-
ance of assistance. How naive
can Mr. Zelkowitz‘ be‘ if he
thinks that people_ just have
children to increase their assis-
tance checks? With every addi-

tion to a family the increase in

allowance is barely enough to
feed or clothua growing young-
ster. You can’t blame D.P.A. for
illegitimate children, you can

only blame the environment and .
lack of education. It must be _.

wonderfulto sit back and watch
TV in a room or so-called house
where there is little or no fur-
niture and a lack of food.
According to Mr. Zelkowitz’s
statement, “A person with two
children gets about $1.50 an hour
for the 40 hour week he did-n’t

rwork,” if my calculations are

correct this is about $250 month-

ly. This is only about $120. over
the actual allowance.

Does Mr. Ze_lkowitz have any
idea about the actual policy, of
placing a lien on property? Does
Mr. Zelkowitz know the re-
quirements for receiving public
assistance, or the income limits
for public housing. « Or ‘is he
aware‘ of the safeguards against
relief chislers of which there

are few ‘in comparison to the’.

total relief rolls? ' ‘ '

If Mr. Zelkowitz thinks it’s' a
vacation? to be on D.P;A., try
working with" these people" for
a summer and“ see how.the other

‘ half of the world looks and lives.

Student Questions
_'|nter-Faith’ Logic
The Editor, The Pitt News:

Quite frankly, Mr. Swetonic,
I do not share your rather strong

opinions concerning’ inter - faith‘

marriages. You believe that the
danger of loss of faith is not
as great as one might expect,
that love conquers all. Well tell
me, what’s going to happen on
issues where ‘there —can be no
compromise? ‘

What’s "going to happen when
the one party is forbidden to
practice birth ‘control and the

' other party is permitted? What

kind of effect do, you “ think it
will have on both partiesvwhen
week after week they go to sep-
arate , churches, or worse yet,
when one remains home in bed?

What’s going‘ to happen when
the one tells the "children that
Christ is God, and yet the other
party thinks that the children
should be told-eopposite? Should
the children be brought .up in
Catholic ‘or public schools?
Whose church should they at-
tend? Should theyiattend at all?
Even more basic — whose
church should the parties them-
selves be married in?

These considerations are but
a few of many and cannotbe
ignored by any intelligent per-

-son. Trusting that~you are in-

deed intelligent, I think you

ought to consider these points i

in your column so that you are

not completely biased.
Furthermore, you believe (and

are perhaps leading others into

your false conclusions) that love"
“is '

is the answer, that love
an essentially selﬁsh emotion."
Mr .Swetonic, come now! An-y-

one knows that real love con-_

sists not in taking, but in giving.

It is essentially selﬂess, not sel-- “

ﬁsh. Real love is a dedication

Not Disgusting Blatant

This film is not the disgusting
blatant, ugly clinical portrayal
shown in practical nursing classes
and college courses in marriage
adjustment. It is told with the
simple amazement of that involv-
ed and left—out. Observer, the
father.

Pain is there, anticipation is
there, fear is there and the
whole is played in a study of
contrasts. The camera is used
by Brakhage to rationalize the
fear and pain with the hope and
beauty of birth, by contrasting
his wife’s labor and birth an-.
guish with her whimsical and
contended anticipation as she

‘amazed and the viewer is too.

enough to provoke an audience.
Goes on Excursion

‘Willard Mass takes his camera
on an excursion through a land
of terror and splendor. The
camera moves, slowly or in start-
ling leaps over this mysterious
landscape, frighteningly alive be-
cause it is alive. The continent be-
ing explored is the human body’
with a travelogue by the British
poet, George Barker.

Barker's dry but not-humor-
ous commentary keeps the ex,-
ploration within the realm _ of
good taste but never interferts
or exaggerates the sexual im-
plications of the analogous pil-
grimage. ’ ‘ '

The trip is worthwhile and the
extreme magniﬁcation is not
really so’ surprising to‘ someone
used to viewing the enormous
puffy lips of a baby taking its
ﬁrst solid food in the Heinz com-
mercial. Geography of the ‘Body
is also in supremely better taste.

More Surprises

It is admittedly hard to follow
a scene of birth and a microscopic
exploration _of the human body

with anything nearly as exciting,

but the series had another sur-
prise for the viewer. I

back shots of dancers. Maya

graphy for Camera which is just

that: The camera dances with

created world. .

. Movement is the theme and
vitality of the film and the move-
ment is constant. The film is bet-
ter viewed as an experiment with
cinematography than the presen-
tation of a dance. But it is short
enough so that all the possibilities
are not exhausted and neither is
the viewer.

the series winds up fortunately

For the young systems engineer there is no more rewarding I
work. You associate with the ‘top men in your ﬁeld. You
work in an atmosphere that allows you to extend your
capabilities professionally and academically.

At MITRE, men trained in single disciplines are encour-
aged to grow beyond their original ﬁeldsof interest. Systems
designers learn to work from an increasingly broad base.

You may work in such diverse areas as information
theory, computer design, display techniques, propagation,
or human engineering. You may analyze. You may syn-
thesize. You may deal with systems or individual compo-
nents. At the highest levels, you may have to consider

— political, economic and social factors. . . as well as the
available and predictable technology.

Requirements, B.S., M.S., or Ph.D. in these disciplines —
electronics, physics, and mathematics. MITRE is located in
pleasant, suburban Boston and also has facilities in»
Washington, D..C.vand Colorado Springs. If an interview
will be inconvenient, inquiries may be directedin conﬁdence

For Saturday

Folksinger Ailene Goodman will
make a returnvisit to the Uni-
versity Saturday, when she will
sing at the Men’s Council and As-
sociated Women ..Students-spon-
sored hootenanny.' The program
will take place at 8:30 p.m. in the
SU lower lounge. -

Miss Goodman entertained Uni-
versity students last May and was
acclaimed by many to possess a
“delightful” voice. Thomas Plate,
who reviewed her performance
last year, said that “Miss Good-
man has a clear and sparkling

voice. She was at her best in
singing the lighter humorous“
songs.

“Her serious ballads were very
much professional and at mo-
ments captured the audience with
their ﬁne nostalgic references.”

Appeared on Radio and TV

In addition to performing at
major nightclubs and giving con-
certs, she has also appeared on
radio and television in New York
and Pittsburgh.

Miss Goodman acts as mis-

tress of ceremonies for. the
Regional ‘Folk Festival Associa--
tion, singing folk songs of

twelve c‘ountries.in the native
languages. The hand-woven and
embroidered costumes which
she wears come from many
parts of.’Europe and America.’

This program is the ﬁrst in a‘

series of activities sponsored by
M.C. and A.W.S. These events will
be scheduled throughout the fall
and winter trimesters. A
Plans Other Events
Other events planned by the

two groups are movies, dances,

and other variety entertainments.
There will be no charge to the
University community for any of
these programs. .

The main goal of M.C.- and
A.W.S. in sponsoring these pro-
grams, is to promote -more week-
end activities for the University
students.

and administrative families.

During the spring trimester,
faculty and administrative tama-

Monday through Friday from 6
to 9 p.m. in addition to the regu-

This trimester, the committee had

“There were so many inquiries
as to why this was cancelled.”

Since joining New Jersey Bell in l960, Paul Forgie
(B.S.M.E., 1960) has handled four important research
studies to improve engineering techniques.

The ﬁrst was a feasibility study to test the company’s
system of outside plant cable records. Paul investigated
a new system of record-keeping that could greatly reduce
engineering and drafting time required by current prac-
.tices. Paulwas invited to presentnhis ﬁndings to the com-

_ pany’s District Engineers.

On later assignments, Paul developed an engineering
quality rating system, analyzed his company’s ready access
cable facilities, and conducted a cost study on conduit.

‘Paul’s analytical approach to tough problems has
opened up a bright future for him at New Jersey Bell.

Paul Forgie, like many young engineers,"is impatient to
make things happen for his company and himself. There are

rewarded than in the. fast-growing _telephone business.l

moves, the University’s Ecuadorian Projectxis ‘weathering the storm.

One recent event is the naming of Lowell Day as new Project Desk Oﬁicer, with

headquarters at the University. The other is the arrival of the ﬁrst contingent of Ecuador-‘

ian students, who are now, enrolled in graduate study programsin the Pittsburgh area.

As the new deskofﬁcer, Day replaces Robert Bailie, who headed the project on —a .

temporary assignment -as part of?‘ .

. his duties as assistant to the Chan-

cellor.
‘ ‘ Interesting Scene

_“I,t.’s been .a rather interesting
past few months watching the
scene down there,” said Bailie.
‘_"l_‘he government was overthrown
and sornen ew administrators
came to the University at Quito.
Fortunately, this has had no effect
on our project.”

Four men comprise the ﬁrst
group of students from Ecuador
now studying in this area. Juan
Sevilla, Ernesto ‘Perez, Herman
Zambrano and Douglas Munoz

H are immersed in their respec-

tive curricula of study under the
program, which gives worthy
students in that Latin Ameri-
can country an opportunity to
earn graduate degrees at promi-
nent American universities.
'.The project is conducted by ‘the
University and Central Univer-
sity at Quito,’Ecuador, under an
Alliance for Progres contract with
the Agency for International De-
velopment (AID). -
' Three at Carnegie
Presently, ‘one of the studerits,
Ernesto Perez, is enrolled in the
Graduate School of Public & In-
ternational Affairs (GSPIA) at
the University, studying Public
Administration. The other three
men are enrolled at Carnegie In-
stitute of Technology in graduate
engineering courses. ~

_Queried as to the reasons for
enrolling the students at Car-
negie Tech, Bailie said that the
AID contract suggests that
member schools place individ- _
guals in those schools that most ‘
suit their backgrounds. For the
Ecuadorians, Carnegie was best
suited. He emphasized that this
placing of students in schools
other than the contractee was
“no departure from previous
-AID programs.

“Aid students are also studying
at‘Ohio State and Louisiana State
Universities, among others,” said
Bailie.

-AID Pays University

Under the three year/ contract
period, AID will pay the Univer-
sity over one million dollars to
cover costs incurred here. The
university at Quito provides fa-

, cilities in Ecuador. ~

At this moment, ten Univer-
sity faculty members are teach-
ing and administering in Quito
for two year terms of work. In '
addition, 12 others have or will
spend one to four months there

‘ on short term assignments.

tually enroll 100 Ecuadorians in
the program." But, according to
Bailie, there is a deﬁnite problem
ﬁnding more than a small number
of eligible students. He said that

“relatively few” are equipped to"

transfer immediately, the language
problem being the major difficulty.

_ 7/Iuch Potential There

“There is so much potential
down there and facilities-for the
most part are just not adequate,”
Bailie continued. “The Univer-
sity wants to help them help
themselves,” said Bailie.

As one of the means of ac-
complishing this end, the AID
program requires .those students
who have completed their
graduate work in the U.S. to
return to Quito and teach for
a certain number of years.
Sevilla, for one, regards this
stipulation as an advantage of
the program not a- condition.

.All four of this ﬁrst contigent ,

of students applied for Fulbright
Fellowships before hearing of the‘
new University’ program. They
never received’ word ' from the
Fulbright officials and were ad-
vised to speak with Dr. AWendell
Schaeifer, the dean of the. fac-
ulty at Quito for the project and
assistant dean of GSPIA at the
University. Dr. Schaeffer certiﬁed
their eligibility and soon the men
were on their way to the U.S.A.
No Stranger Here
Day, the new desk -officer, is
no stranger to the University.
He studied here in 1958-57 work-
ing .on an M.A. in political sci-
ence. At present he is studying
for his doctorate at the University
while working with the project.
Day came here fresh from a year
spent in Santiago, Chile, on a
grant from the Doherty ‘Founda-
tion of Princeton University.
He is a native of Western
Pennsylvania, born near Union‘-
town. Previously Day taught for
two years as an assistant pro.-
fessor in political science at
Baldwin -Wallace College in
Berea, Ohio. At the moment, he
is busy setting up new oﬁices
for the project in 1628 lower C.
Los senores are getting to know
the city of Pittsburgh and impres-
sions are generally favorable.
“The people are the best part of
the city, they all are so friendly,”
said Sevilla. He especially likes
the idea of being, able to work in

.th¢.-.°..i*¥~ an ﬁsens‘ Ping .hs>me. to

a quiet suburb only minutes away.
Half the Population

Though Quito, his home, (has
only one half the population of
Pittsburgh, Sevilla considers
Pittsburgh a small town; “It is
so spread out,” he said.

The men attending Tech call
themselves “Pitt students who
go to Carnegie.” They live next
to a fraternity house and Zam-
brano, in particular, says that
he cannot understand how the
fraternity’ boys can ﬁnd so
much time to’ play tennis and
football. He claims he can never
get all his work done and can-
not even think of sports.

Sevilla apparently manages. He
attended the Pitt—Washington
game and says, ‘fl think I will
go to them all.” «
I" Wants Exchange Program

What is the eventual aim of the
University in this program? Bailie
says that the University wants to
exchange teachers and students.

'-“The program gives these stu-

dents exposure to our advanced
state and the opportunity to gain
by our knowledge. _ .

“The function of the University

is that of an institution with an

interest in helping the interna-
tional situation. It beneﬁts these
students while it_ enhances our
own program by exposure to peo-
ple of a completely different back-
ground.” .

Jazz   Concert Perks

Hall, the Modern Jazz
Quartet (MJQ) came to life and
found itself a real" jazz groove.

This famed foursome, composed
of John Lewis, piano, Milt Jack-
son, vibes, Percy Heath, bass, and
Connie -Kay, drums, for all its pro-
fessional” competence and slick-
ness, was lackluster in its per-
formances before intermission.
The playing was mechanical, “go-
ing through the motions.”

Admittedly, few, groups exist
that can go through the “mo-
tions” of this quartet, but the jazz
audience had‘ come _to expect a
great deal more than it got in that
ﬁrst portion of the concert.

Just Warming Up
‘Apparently, the MJQ was just
warming to the task, for the re-
mainder of the concert was a joy.

Jackson, who hasno peer on
his instrument, was superb. His
improvisations ‘were robust
though always lyricle and the
haunting timbre of the vibes
was never more effectively pre-
sented. He was especially im-
pressivze on the old reliable, “I
Should Care,” and “Skating in.
Central Park,” a. John L_ewis
composition. . ~ -

“Lewis gave his usual lessons for
budding pianists as he led the
group through tunes of varying
colors and rhythms, omnipresent
though_ unobstrusive in support
of the Jackson solos. Lewis is a
marvel to watch as he, seemingly
thinking out loud, pickshis notes

and weaves intricate solos before‘

the eyes of the audience.

Chose Notes Carefully

His playing is lean, his ‘notes
carefully. chosen, and his overall
impact is that ofgcomplicated but
never. saccharine sweetness. ‘He
played especially well on “One
Never Knows,” “Winter Tale,”
and “Bag’s Groove.”

 

Heath and Kay were faultless
in their support of the two
soloists. Heath, flashing a warm
and toothy grin after each num-. '
ber, played his instrument with‘
obvious affection. His short solo
on “Ralph’s New Blues” was a.
standout. V

v,Kay, destroying once and for-
ever the myth that drummers are
metronomes, supplied color -to the
quartet’s music as he ticked the
triangle ever so gingerly, went ‘to_

After a dull ﬁrst half in its Sat-
urday night concert at -Carnegie

sional “bomb” on the bass drum.
He also took a brief but interest-
ing solo on “Ralph’s New Blues,"
named after jazz critic Ralph J.
Gleason." I ‘

Didn’t Sound Tired "
The quartet, after all these
years together, did not sound
“tired” as has been the recent
claim. The ﬁrst half of the con-
cert was listless but was thorough-
ly redeemed by that second por-
tion.—

The audience, composed mainly

of young people, warmly received

the music. The quartet performed
two encores, one. of which was
Jobim’s “Carnival,” a Bossa Nova
composition, which would deem

' that most lyrical idiom as ﬁrmly
‘established on these shores. For
when one of the most successful ,
groups incorporates a relatively. ‘

new idiom into its material, ac-f,

Future Grid Decline

 

  

Denied by Carver J

A prediction of rapid decline for Pitt football was
made in the,October 7 issue of the Pittsburgh Weekly
Sports, a new and worthy edition to the ﬁeld of sports

publications.

In an editorial the paper listed three reasons why
the decline is imminent. It cited recent sub-par freshman

teams, the abandonment of

trance requirements as reasons for the demise of top—rate

football here.

, About the low caliber freshman teams the paper said,

5 “Pitt’s ‘last three frosh squads have been
The 1963 team has just 21 scholar-
ship players, and although some of .
the ‘athletes are top-ﬂight _stars, the

- quality is lacking.”

. This was one point that Carver
. ' had to agree on. “We have not had
_ outstanding freshman teams re-
cently,” he said, “but I do not feel
this is a trend. We’re allowed to

- take 25"boys each year. If half of
’ those come on to be good players

we’ll ‘be in ﬁne shape.”

Varsity coach J ohniMiche‘losen __ . _ .
will have to scrape to get 12 good men off of this year’s
team which was humiliated, by Navy last Saturday, 32-0.

Carver could not agree on the other points. —“I
don’t feel that cutting out red-shirting ‘will hurt us,”
the athletic director said.‘ “I’ve seen kids unhappy be- 9
cause they were re-shirted. When it "came to‘ their
senior year they didn’t feel like playing.‘ I think
we’ll be better off in the long run now that we don’t

hold our boys for a year.”

Carver had to admit though that four members‘ of
this year’s starting line, Joe Kuzneski, John Maczuzak,
Ernie Borghetti and Ed Adamchik, were red-shirts.,Mac-
zuzak and Kuzneski probably would have never made .
first string status if they had not been held out for a year.

Higher entrance requirements are bound to pose a
problem, but Carver felt that since 25 candidates were al-
lowed to be brought in each year that would be enough to _

supply the team with talent.

' Undoubtedly the strongest point brought up by the

Pittsburgh Weekly Sports is

that have been brought in recently.
Of the frosh who .were brought in 1961, only’
Fred Mazurek and Bill Bodle are regulars. Even
‘worse, only Bill Howley, Ron Linaburg and Marty
-Schottenheimer are running with the second unit.
' Only ﬁve men out of a‘ class‘ of over 20 are able to run '
with the second unit or better in their junior year.

It’s too early to tell about last year’s freshmen. Only
three, Kenny Lucas, Jim Jones and Eric Crabtree, are
playing consistently. There are reputed to be other good
prospects, but they have’ too ‘much talent in front of

them to see action. -

This year’s frosh have only a few big names and they

did little in losing to Navy;

Perhaps the Pittsburgh Weekly Sports is right. We

_ hope not.

remaining, the Panthers with

West Virginia can almost deﬁn-9

ately be counted on for a victory
over the Panthers, in view of its
decisive win over Navy.

The Lions won last year’s meet
by a one sided 18-43, taking ﬁve
of the ﬁrst six places. With only
three of the ﬁve returning, the
Lions appear to be much weaker

than last year. This is their sec-‘

ond meet of the season, they lost
their opener to Cornell 25-30.
Last Away Meet
The meet is the last away for
the Panthers this season. The
course is ﬁve miles and is located
around the University Park golf
course. Last year Larry Robinson
took third place on this course
with a time "of 27:02.
Already this year on the more
‘ difficult course in Amiallolis
d: .

 

with times of 26:09 and 26:42.

.According to Rees, “the team is
ﬁnally starting to get into shape,
this is especially true of Eichen-
laub and Robinson. In the Navy
meet Steve Waslo ran the best
he has in quite a while. He led
for the ﬁrst two miles."

“Our- best chance in ,.winning
lies in Bailey being able to get his
ﬁrst win of the season and the
rest of the team backing him
up with a small spread,” Rees
commented._ '

ami of Ohio before losing.

’ Couldn’t Get Fourth .
Panther teams have ,won three
straight in 1952, 1954, 1955 in
addition to 1958 since then, with-
out being able to come up with
the elusive number four.

j The inability of the Pan-
thers to win four -in a row be-
came a. conversation topic‘ dur-
ing the 1950s spurred on by a
former Pittsburgh sportswriter
George Kiseda, who said Pitt
could not “win four games be-
cause they lacked .the proper
desire. The statement was billed
as Kiseda’s Law and grew in
stature as year after year the
Panthers were unable to win
four in a. row, although they
had two bowl teams during the
50s. ‘ '

Michelosen dismisses the wis-
dom of Kiseda’s Law. “The only
thing. that will stop us from win-
ning four in ‘a row is West Vir-
ginia,” he said. “And: not Kis-
enda’s Law. I don’t see where

, Kisenda ever made anything out

of it either. It just happens we
lost to good football teams. It
wasn’t and isn’t a question of how
badly we wanted to win.”

IF alters Again

In Yogi Race
I I Miss Smith '
Bob “Sage” Smizik, for the

‘second week in a row, was i
‘humiliated by the girls in the

Yogi contest. While the girls,
in the person of Gussie Smith
piled up a robust- 11-4 record,
the sports editor could only man-
age. 7-8.

I To avoid Smizik’s being humili-
ated again, the yogi writer chose

. Stephanie Angerman to pick for
,the girls. Smizik hopes she doesn’t

know anything about football. He
isalready searching for a girl to
pick next week’s Yogi. “I’m out

‘looking for a girl who doesn’t

know anything about football,”
the Sage said. ’

Miss Angerman, however,
doesn’t expect to let the girls
down. “We’re in 'ﬁrst place and
I’m goingto keep us there,” she
said. “Ina way, 1 feel‘ sorry for
Smizik,” she said. .“I think he
should give up trying to pick all
the losers. At least, it-looks like
that’s what he’s doing.”

Girls Forget O’Brien

Miss Angerman never mention-
ed’ Jim “Juggernaut” O’Brien. All
the girls seem to have forgotten
him, especially since he is wal-
lowing in last place for the third
week in a row. He even seems to
be comfortable there.

Like Casey Stengel did two
years ago, O’Brien has plum-
mented from last year's cham-
pionship to this year's cellar.
“The girls have been most un-
fair,” O’Brien said. “When, we
go out on dates, they "always,
ask me who I’ll pick. Then they
pick the other teams.”

One person who has had little
trouble picking the winners I the
past two weeks is Marvin “Isaiah”
Zelkowitz. The prophet has climb-
ed in two weeks from last place to
a tie for second. Thus spake he
unto Smizik,'O’Brien, and their
multitudinous following: “Yea, the
fair ones still lead the contest.
But behold, they shall falter, and
stumble into your murky depths
. . . And behold, there shall be a"
great holocaust among you.

r Isaiah Won't Falter

“But I shall not falter, and my
ﬂaming chariot still rises on to-
wards that promised land, the
number one spot in the Yogi,” the
prophet said. '

Carl DePasqua, Panther» de-
fensive coach, picked for the
coaches this week. The coaches,
who now trail the girls by ﬁve
games, are counting on De-

‘ Pasqua to bring them back.

To come back, however, the
coaches must catch their players.
To do this, they tried to send in
picks from the bench, but Chan-
cellor Litchﬁeld intercepted the
message.

Because of Litchﬁeld’s move,
Panther tackle John Macuzak had
to make his own picks for the sec-
ond place players.
