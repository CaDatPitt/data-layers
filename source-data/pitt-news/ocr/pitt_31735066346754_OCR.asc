Fall Freshman Class
Of 1000 Expected

Everard K. Pinneo, director of admissions, announced
that he expects a freshmen class of about 1,000 _students
for the fall trimester. The University had a freshman class

of 1,350 in 1960 and a little under 1,100 last fall.
The three main reasons for the drop in enrollment ac- .

cording to Pinneo are; there is a national dip in the num-
¢ber of 18 year-old students, many

WPDU to Face
Cornell Team

‘ d   F '
At Mid ay r1.

The William Pitt Debating
Union will oppose the Cornell
Debate Association at the
Midday Series scheduled for
Friday, noon in the SU Ball-
room. Topic of the debate is
“Resolved: That the House Com-
mittee on Un-American Activi-
ties should be abolished.”

The commitee on Un-American
Activities is a standing organiza-
tion of the House of Representa-
tives, consisting of nine members:
four are from the minority party
and five are from the majority
party. Members of the committee
are elected by the House.

The Cornell team will present
the affirmative side of the debate,
represented by Nancy ’Rosen,
freshman from Long‘ Island, and

Alan Berkeley, a sophomore from‘

New Rochelle, New York.

Local Debaters

The University’s team, consist-
ing of Larry Profan-t,_ a junior
English major who has debated
for a year, and Alan Cazen, a
sophomore English major, will de-
liver the negative view.

The House commitee on Un-
.American activities was started
on January 3, 1945. Prior to
this. other special committees
were set up to investigate Un-
‘American activities. The first
of these committees was organ-
ized June 9, 1930.

Duties of the committee include
investigations of the extent and
character of Un-American activi-
ties in the United States and of
the diffusion within the United
States of subversive activities in-
stigated from foreign countries.

a .

students from this area choose to ‘

go away to school, and the Uni-
versity no longer offers an under-

graduate program in Business Ad— '

ministration.

Pinneolthinksthat the dearth of
18 year-olds will continue up to

1963 and the World War 11 baby '

boom will begin in 1964. He ex-
plained that the University has
eliminated the undergraduate
Buisiness Administration school
because University personnel feel
that Business Administration edu-

cation belongs at graduate level.~

Nc more freshmen will be admit-

ted to the School of Business Ad-

ministration‘ this fall.
Acceptances Dropped

Based on the present rate of ap-

plications, the University will re-

‘ceive 3000 applications, of these

about 2000 will be accepted and

the freshmen class will depend on

how many of ‘those accepted
‘choose to attend here. In 1960 the
University got 61 percent of the
high school seniors it accepted, last
year the figure dropped to about
47 percent. ‘

Pinneo believes this is due to
thefact that the University is
competing with prestige colleges
in the East. Students apply to
the University asvsecond or third
choice to Ivy League colleges.
The University would rather
have a small freshmen class than
acept students with little,chance
of surviving academically. The
University does take a chance on
some “late bloomers” but only if
College Board scores indicate high
potential.
5 Estimates Enrollment
The University gets 48 percent
of its freshmen class from Alle-
gheny county, 25 percent from
other counties in Pennsylvania,
and 27 percent from out of state.
Pinneo commented that the
freshmen class enrollment is
just an estimate as the students
can apply till May 1 and then

Orville prescott of New York Times commented, “Bar-A

lf that she has ‘a horrible fa-
the most challenging and in-

fluential of contemporary writersé

jects.

“Her industry,
learning and earnestness are all;
impressive. An editor ,of the Lon- ;
don Economist, a specialist in both 
economics and foreign affairs, the
author of three superior books,
a popular radio commentator in
her native England and an elo-
quent performer on the lecture
platform, Miss Ward seems almost 3
unfairly talented.”

versatility, ‘

Born in Yorkshire

Miss Ward was born in York-
shire, England and educated at the
Sorbonne in Paris. She also stu-
died in Germany and at Somer-
ville College, where she took a
first class honors degree in philo-
sophy, politics, and economics.

Harvard and Smith Colleges
have awarded honorary degrees i
to Miss Ward. ‘In 1939 she be-
came ‘assistant editor of The
Economist and has been associ-
ated with the paper ever since.

She has been Governor of the

BBC, London’s Sadlers Wells
and Old Vic Theater.

Miss Ward is known to millions
for her appearances on “The
Great Challenge” and “Meet The
Press.” Her articles appear reg-
ularly in the New York Times
Sunday Magazine. Her books in-
clude “Faith and Freedom,” “Five
Ideas that Change the World,”:
“India and the West.” “The Westl,
at Bay" and “Policy for thef
West.” 3

Society Exists For Man I

“This century,” says Miss,
Ward, “is not the century of thef
common man. It’s the century‘
of man, like any other century.
The Western world has never
known any belief other than that;
society exists for the protection of
the human individual; that the‘
human individual in society can
achieve goodness and wisdom and
freedom.”

“If we lost that faith, then we
shall not survive whatever we
do, because it is that faith which
is the tap-root of democratic s_o-
Ciety. We can build up our de-
fenses. VVe can build up our L
armaments. We can multiply
our material satisfaction. In the

end we shall fail because if
there is no vision, the people
perish.”

Last year U.S. Justice Earl
Warren had been the speaker atl
the convocation. He was awarded
an honorary degree in Doctor of
Civil Law and was given an hon-
orary membership in Druids.

Warren served as Chief Justice
under the Eisenhower administra-
tion. He was vice-presidential
candidate in 1948, and is a past

Recruit Plans

Everard K. Pinneo, director
of admissions, has announced
that plans are underway for
a new program for “selling
the University to prospective
high school seniors.”

Although no formal plans have
been set, Pinneo stated that-the
basis of the plan will involve
certain University students who
will return to their high schools

.to introduce the school to the col-

lege-minded seniors.

“We have been working with
the alumni and some students to
form an ‘Undergraduate Schools
Committee,’ the director said.
“We ‘plan to have some students
go with the officers of the admis.
sions office and encourage the
seniors of their school to visit the
University campus and spread the
word about the University.”

Pinneo added that this plan is
based upon activities of the
Alumni Association and, although
not new, will need much clariﬁ-

students to participate in the

  
 
 

cation before it can be “utilized

to its ‘ fullest extent.” , 5

New Student Government Meets;  
Olofson Discusses Responsibilites

BY JOSEY GROSSMAN

SG president Tom Olofson and
V i c e-president Judy Diethorn
opened the first meeting of the
newly elected Senate with a dis-
cussion of the duties and objec-
tives of the new_ administration.

Olofson explained first the duty
of the senators. “In order to prop-
erly represent the attitudes of the
student body,” he told the group,
“you must understand the wants
and needs of the students. You
must delve into these areas and
convey your observations to SG.
As leaders you must find out
what’s going on: you must be ac-
quainted with all campus incidents
and activities.”

Miss Diethorn cemented, "This

is the beginning 01' a difficult year ‘

and a very important one. To be
strong we must be truly represen-
tative. Keep your eyes and ears
open and bring back any problems
and constructive ideas.”

“Our biggest problem last
year,” she continued, “was lack
of communication. Work on this.
We want your ideas, your think-
ing, and your co-operation. Re-
member that you are a senator
and let other people know it.
When people start coming to
you with ideas and questions.
then we know we've succeed-
ed.”

Miss Diethorn announced that

she and Olofson will meet withi

have not set up cabinets to con-
summate this part of the Repre-
sentative Plan.

She explained that investigating
committees, composed entirely of
senators, will file their minutes in
the SG office after every meeting.
Complete reports of each investi-
gation will also be ﬁled and may
be used as reference in the final
committee report.

Asked to define the difference
between investigating commit-
tees and service committees,
Miss Diethorn said that investi-
gating committees deal with
specific problems whereas ser-
vice committees, headed by
members of the student body
appointed by the Senate, con-
centrate on certain jobs and
events, like the Book Store and
pep rallies.

Under new business, the Senate
first approved five members of
the executive cabinet: Richard
Minker, director of finance; Al
Schlosser, director of public rela-
tions; Beth Baumgart, director of
major events; Vicki Israelsky, re-
cording secretary; and Linda Be-
saha, executive secretary. The di-
rector of student organizations has
not yet been appointed.

Miss Diethorn said that she
wanted the three permanent in-
vestigating committees - Saga,
Human Relations, and Health Ser-
vice ~ to start their work immed-

It was also passed to set up an

voices in the fall. Volunteers for
this committee were Donald
Hamilton, Pete Bijur, Elayne Dar-

N. Ronald Pease, SG adviser,
made the finalcomment,” There
is usually a great deal of fire in
new student governments in the
spring; in the fall, there are still
some hot coals; in the winter, all
that’s left is a lot of smoke. I hope
this flame will continue to burn.”

some drop out for numerous
reasons. Pitt Preview is held to
provide further insight for the
applicants about the University
and thus help them in making
their decision about attending
the University.

"Applications and enrollment
are on schedule,” Pinneo said.
Asked if in his opinion the tuition
raise would afect fall enrollment,
Pinneo said, “we have not turned
down any promising student due
to lack of funds; we are ready to
give financial aid to all deserving
-cases."

Pinneo agreed that high tuition
may keep some mediocre students
from attending college but said
that "tuition is not out of line in
any way" and is on a par with

other private institutions with

which the University is competing.

hoops. and Mu.rlboro Clg‘2iI‘t’t-t.(‘S.

And we all know how l'a.milia.r that is-—I mean Marlboro ciga-
rs‘-tt»cs. And why should it not be familiar? Why, where learning
is king, where taste is sovereign, where brain power rules
supreme, should not Marlboro be everyone’s favorite? The same
good sense that gets you through an exam in Restoration Poetry
or solid-state physics certainly does not desert you when you
come to pick a. cigarct-te. You look for a ﬂavor that is ﬂavorful,
a filter pure and white, a choice of pack or box, a lot to like. You
look, in short-, for Marlboro-—a.nd happily you don’t have to look
far. lVfI'arlboro is :i.\'a.ilable at your friendly tobacconist"s or vend-

But I (ligrcss. We were speaking of the new c:unpu.s phenome-
non-— the artist-in-residence—~a man or woman who writes,
paints, or composes right on your very own campus and who is
also :1 vnilable for occasional consultations with superior students.

' ‘nkc, for example, William Cullen Sigafoos, artist-in-residence ,

at the Toledo College of Belles Lettres and Fingerprint Identiﬁ-
cation.

As we all know, Mr. h‘ig:il'oos has been working for many years
on an epic poem in rhymed couplets about the opening of the
Youngstown-Akrou highway. Until, however, he went into
residence at the Toledo College of Belles Lettres and Finger-
print. Iclentificntion, his progress was not what you would call
rapid. He started well enough with the immortal couplet we all
know: They speed along on ll.?}l0(’[S of rvubberr, r11.sln7n.g home in
time for subbcr . . . V

Then Mr. Siga.t'oos got. stuck. It is not that his muse deserted
him: it is that he became involved in a. series of time-consuming
episodv..-r—a prcfrontal lobotomy for Irwin, his faithful sled
dog; fourteen consecutive months of jury duty on _a very com-
plicated case of overtime parking; getting his ceattail caught in
the door of a jet bound for Brisbane, Australia; stuff like that.

He was engaged in a very arduous job in Sandusky—posing
for a sculptor of h ydrants—-when an offer came from the Toledo
College of Belles Lettres and Fingerprint Identification to take
up resiileiice there, ﬁnish his mo.gm:m opus and, from time to
time, see a few gifted students.

Mr. Sigafoos accepted with pleasure and in three short years
com plcted the second couplct of his Youngstown -Akron Turnpike
epic: The higl1,21'ay is mmlzi of solid concrete and at the toll station you
get 0. rriecipl.

Then a few gil'ted'students came to visit him. They were is
prepossessing lot—the boys with corduroy jackets and long,
shaggy beards; the girls also with corduroy. jackets but with
beards neatly braided.

“What is truth?” said one. “What is beauty?” said another.

“Should a writer live first and write later or should he write
and do a little living in his spare time?” said another.

“How do you find happiness—and having found it, how do
you get rid of it?” said another.

“Whither are we drifting?” said another.

“I don’t know whither you are drifting,” said Mr. Sigafoos,
“but as for me, I am drifting back to Sandusky to pose for the
hydrant sculptor.”

And back he went, alas, leaving only a fragment of his Youngs-
town-Akron Turnpike epic to rank with other such uncom-
pleted masterpieces as Schubert/s Unﬁnished Symphony, the
Venus de Milo, and Singer’s Midgets. o ma Mn sh-nun

Soapbox Seelrer  

No one is questioning George Lincoln Rockwell’s right
to speak as head of the American Nazi Party. What does
concern students is the question, should we extend an in-
vitation for him to use that right on our campus?

Before making a ﬁnal decision, it is necessary to con-

sider that area which will bear most heavily on the out-
come of the speech——-student and speaker motivation. In

a democracy such as ours, all. philosophies are granted
means for expression in the belief that the weaker ones
will die of their own accord.

‘But judging from reactions to the article which ap-
peared in Monday’s Pitt Ne,ws, such high ideals have given
way to a more realistic attitude that “someone should get
that maniac Rockwell.” Open hostility tinged with an hon-
est curiosity have aroused cries of freedom of speech. in
order to bring the enemy within ﬁring ‘range. It is not un-
likelyithatr emotions will weigh heavily in audience re-
ception should Rockwellbe invited to speak here.

And emotionalfsm is just what Rockwell is looking for.

. It is thevfoundatio-_n for his own illogical arguments aimed
‘to. stir up reaction. But if_ this is the sole purpose of Rock-

w‘ell’s deliveries he would not need a university audience.»
His appeal to "the intellectuals is more deeply rooted in the
prestige connected with speaking at a big name univer-
sity.’ The fact that he was “invited” to speak is also a major

‘factor in Rockwell’s subtle searchfor a‘ soapbox, for pro-
« -paganda is deliberate truth turning. B

ButRockwell’s success in a university‘ such? as ours
Seems somewhat precarious, and his very approach could
easily. reverse the desired outcome. It’s often stated that

exposure to the performance of a demagogue known only-’
through history books is an education in itself. Yet this is

exactly the way a demagogue works; he attracts a crowd
of cynics who give him the publicity he so seeks. It seldom
matters to him t.he exact reasons for their attendance as
long as they are there. V

It is the same trick pulled in Germany not -so long
ago when thousands of curious people went to see “that

crazy ‘Austrian paperhanger.”

At least two professors have introduced an-
other of those revolutionary new concepts of edu-
cation, the ﬁrst being the trimester, pioneered
weekly by the University. The latest in a long
series of modernized teaching
methods is a variation ona tired
old _theme called the "term
paper.” '

Apparently, it isn’t enough to
spend a trimester in the library

some “chairman” or “director”
‘has borrowed for the entire term
or to sacriﬁce opportunities for
supplementary ’c o u r s e-related
readings in order to write a
paper on a subject so‘ narrow in
scope that it has -little signiﬁcance with core ma-
terial. Term papers waste the undergraduates
time and effort.» The research familiarizes him with
library facilities and makes him an “expert” in his
microscopic ﬁeld. But required readings are ig-
nored because the ‘teacher demands ﬁfty pagesof
text or twenty books in the bibliography or a
minimum of"100 note cards.

Discussion Suffers

The conscientious student, however, should not

Such mediocre procedure ciheapens the Uni-

Team Title

Mat Coach Rex Peery will 7

take an abbreviated six man
team to the National Collegi-
ate Athletic Association
Tournament this weekend at
Stillwater, Oklahoma.

Representing Pitt in the tour-
nament will be Rich Martin, 123,
John Zolikoff, 137, Daryl Kel-
vington, 1-47, Jim Harrison, 167,
Ken Barr, 177 and Tom Jeffries,
191. V

The best the Panthers have ever
done in this tournament was sec-
ond pla-ces in 1954 and 1957. This

position appears to be the best ‘

even the most ardent Panther fan
can hope for this year.
Champs Return
Not only will the team be han-
dicapped by having only six men,
but perennial champion Oklaho-
ma State is an overwhelming
choice to take the team title.
Peery said, “I can’t see anyone
but Oklahoma State coming in

ﬁrst.”
The Cowboys have defending
champions at 157 and 177

pounds in Phil Kinyon and Bob
Johnson plus a trio of title con-
tenders. Masaaki Hatta, a two
time runner-up at 123 pounds,‘
will be favored to win his class.
At 167 pounds the Cowboys will
be represented by Ronnie Clinton,
8. runner-up in 1960g_,_an-d a third
place ﬁnisher last year. Sopho-
more heavyweight Joe James also
has a shot at the title.
Seek 23rd Title
These ﬁve plus ﬁve more top
notch grapplers should give Okla-
homa State their 23rd NCAA
crown in the 30 years the tourney
has been held.
Among the Panther entries,
Martin has the best chance of
winning. He lost to Hatta in
the semi-finals last year, 7-3.
The Japanese-born wrestler
scored three take downs for six
points in that match. Under
the new rules three take downs
are only worth four points.
Martin is out to prove that his
loss in the Eastern ﬁnals was all
a big mistake and there would be
no more convincing way of prov-
ing it than by besting Hatta and

taking National honors.

Serious Threat
Kelvington is the only other
Panther with a chance of being
seeded. His win in the Eastern
ﬁnals over last year’s National
runner-up, Ron Pifer, makes him

Hall Finishes 92nd
In F roshEvent

A small freshman wrestling
team performed creditably in the
‘Freshman Invitational Tourna-
ment held last weekend at West
Point, New York.

Due to the fact that five ofvthe
Cubs are ineligible, only three
Pitt grapplers entered the meet.
Lee Hall, a 177 pounder, made
the best showing of the group.
The muscular former state cham-
pion lost to Lehigh’s Joe Glad-
dish, 3-2, in the ﬁnals. He had
scored easy decisions over three
opponents before going down to
defeat.

Don Caslowtooka third ‘place
in the 137 pound bracket. Caslow
lost to the champion-to-be Bart
Henderson in the semi-ﬁnals, but
came on to win two consolation
matches and gain the third spot.

John Irving, who was entered
in the 130 pound class, won his
first match but lost a close 2-1
decision to the eventual cham-
pion, Doug Moffatt of Cornell in
the next round.

Syracuse lead in the unofficial
team standing with thre: first

a serious threat for the title.

Besides Pifer, Kelvington will
have to get by Jerry Frude of
Wyoming’. Bob Marshall of Pur-
due and Mickey Stewart of
Iowa State.

The chances of Zolikoﬂ“. copping

a National crown were severely’

darkened when he lost to Mike
Harman in the Eastern ﬁnals. He
still can be considered a contender
and on a good day is capable of
beating any 137 pounder.

The competition appears to be
too stiff for Harrison, Barr ilnd
Jefiries, but they are capable of
placing. .
Attitudes Count

According to Peery, “a lot de-
pends on the mental attitudes of
the boys. If they go in with the
right frame of mind, conﬁdent of
winning, they» could go a long
way.”

The Engineers will send a full

The mentor doesn’t feel that the
optimism of the Lehigh followers
is not well grounded. “Like I
said I can’t see anyone beating
Oklahoma State. ~Lehigh’s best
chances lie with Kirk Pendleton,
Dave An-gell and Jim Detrixhe.

ment. The expected -grudge match
between Martin and Lehigh’s Bill
Merriam may not come off. Mer-
riam is attempting to get his
weight down to 115 pounds, and
if he can he will enter that weight
division.

The National title seems out of
reach, but individual honors are
available for the Panthers. Beat-
ing out Lehigh in the team scor-
ing would also be a major conso-
lation for the Eastern drubbing.

Mile Relay Quartet Posts Fast
‘Clocking In Cleveland K of Us

Classiﬁed as the second-best
mile relay quartets at the Cleve-
land Knights of Columbus‘ indoor
track meet last weekend, Pitt and
Yale upstaged the supposedly ‘bet-
ter teams in their own private
race.

The Eli’s outstretched the Pan-
thers in the winning time of
3219.9 on the 12-lap boards, as

’ Coach Carl Rees’ team pulled up

second in the fast time of 3:2l.5,
with Notre Dame just behind.
Villanova, one of the nation’s
best track powers, was clocked in
3221.9 in topping Michigan and
Western Michigan in the ﬁrst-
rate class. The Panther clocking
proved to be the fastest since 1960
for the Pitts when Mel‘Barnwe1l,

Joe Friend, 5l.4;. Mike Slutsky,

Jay Moody, Vince Wojnar and
-Zinneford Smith set an IC4A
standard —— 3:18.-6. '

The individual legs in respec-;:
tive order for the thin‘-clads were:

50.4; Vance Carter, 49.3; and
Steve Munter, 50.0. “It was really
encouraging,” Rees said, “and the
boys were happy to get back at
Notre‘ Dame. They beat us in a
dual match when we didn’t have

NCAA Title Honors

By non sivnzrx ,

If Daryl Kelvington continues the outstanding wrestling
that he showed in_the recent Eastern Wrestling Champion-
ships, a new picture may be added to the Gallery of Cham-
pions that adorns the vestibule of the Field House. There is
only one spot remaining and Daryl will be doing his best
to see that it is his likeness that gains the honored position.

. It will be noieasy task for theO
veteran Panther star“. Standing in
his road will be a formidable ar-

Kelvington to say
an easy match
at Nationals.” ‘ ,

lKelvington
never
in Na-
tionals in two
previous tries
but the chances
may be better
now that he has 
moved up to 5
the -147 pound
class.

 

“I’ve never had

   

 

placed

Daryl Kelvington.
Enjoys Change

“I think the move up to 147
pounds has helped me greatly,”

I didn’t have the sense to realize
that I couldn’t do my best at 137
pounds. I tried so hardpbut I just
d.idn’t have the physical ability t0 y
do what I wanted.

_ Even though he believes that
he wrestles better at 147
pounds, Kelvington was the vic-
tim of two dual meet losses,
both upsets. this year.

“Wrestling is a sport in which

you can’tmake mistakes,” he ex-
plains. I made mistakes in both
my matches and they cost me
dearly.

Mistakes Costly

“Mistakes cost us an undefeated
season too. I made one against
Michigan and Tom Jeffries made
one against Lehigh and they cost
_us a perfect record.”

Although an undefeated sea-
son wasn’t theirs, the Panthers
had a fine 7-1-1 mark. Kelving-
ton attributes this to teamwork.
“Every one helps everyone else
on this team. Our sophomores
came through so well partly be-
cause everyone worked with
them and -showed them what
they were doing wrong.

“Another thing. The spirit on
this team was great. When I, ﬁrst
came here we had some ‘doggers’
on the team. But not now. Every-
one works hard.” ‘

Needs. Work

Hardwork is what it will take
for Kelvinton to Win Nationals
and hard work is what he puts
forth. He recognizes his weakness-
es and works to improve them.

“I’m not too good on my
feet,” the Trinity High grad
states. My opponents know this
and are always trying for leg
take downs. I’ve found that the
best way to counter this [is ‘with
my whizzer.”

With his whizzer Kelvington
does more than counter any take
down attempts, he just. about com-
pletely nullifies them. This is
amplyproved by the sparse num-
ber of takedowns, four, that have
been scored against Daryl in his
dual meet career.

“I don’t see where he gets that,”

what he’s going to do and that’s a

' great advantage.”

l Baseball   Team Anxious I 
pTo Get Outdoors Soon

BY BOB SMIZIK

The. beautiful Monday morningl
weather that lapsed into rain and
snow in the afternoon postponed
any plans that Coach Bobby Lewis
might have had of getting his
baseball team outdoors for some
much needed ‘work.

The confines. of the Field House
are not the ideal place to play
baseball but Lewis makes the best
of it. “We’ve been trying to get
as many of the things that can be
done indoors out of the road. We
can work on our pick-off plays
and hunting indoors almost as
well as outside so that’s what
we’ve been concentrating on.

“Of course, we give the boys
turns in the batting cage,” the
coach continued, “and we give
them some fielding practice, but
you can’t judge batting and field-
ing until you /get outdoors.”

The inclement wheather is not
causing Lewis as much worry as
in past years. True it is ‘still a
large problem, but it should -be
somewhat eased by the trip to
sunny Virginia that the diamond-

“If we play gamesin the after-
noon well also be able to get some

The three exhibition games
against the Army teams on April
19-21 will also give the coach a
chance to use some of his fresh-
