Council

proposes

CGS fee

— increase

By Lisa DiMeno
Staff Writer

After “penny-pinching” all
year, the College of General
Studies Student Govern-
ment Council is looking
into raising its Student Activities
fee.

Just as its counterpart in
the College of Arts and Sciences
is facinga fee increase, the
council said it’ may have to ask
for one as well. The proposal
was made at last night’s council
meeting. 4

‘‘We’ve been penny-pinching

I all year,” council President Mary

Anna Smith said.

Blaine Feeser, director of the
budget andlfinance division
of the council, encouraged
council members .last night to

consider raising the Student

Activitieslfee. ‘ ‘
“It would be in our best inter-

est to jump on the bandwagon ‘ 0

and increase when they do,”
Feeser said.

Demand for existing CGS
services and new. programs has
been rising, making the
fee increase necessary, accord-
ing to Feeser. Also, a decrease in
CGS enrollment is leaving less
funds for the council to work
with.

“We want to encourage the
growth of new programs,”
Feeser said.

corporation controlled by a vol-
untary board of directors. The
purpose of Family House is to
create an atmosphere of com-
fort while allowing the guests to
create the home. I
“This is the most wonderful
home in Pittsburgh. They
should call it family home
because it is the most cozy,
amazing place in the world.
The walls hold every emotion
ever expressed by a human
being,” said Patricia Deegan, a
former guest of Family House.
Locatedhin Oakland, Family
House is made up of two hous-
es that serve the needs of long-
term patients and their families
and the Residence _Inn, which
extends help to short-temi fami-

House’s first home at 233
McKee Place opened and in
July 1989,_514 North Neville St.
became the second Family

House. The Residence Inn was
opened in May 1991. This year
marks Family House’s tenth
anniversary. They" have accom-
modated over 16,000 guests
from all 50 states and numerous
foreign countries. ,

The administrative staff is
comprised of an executive
director, director of business
and finance, director of devel-

ations, director of volunteer ser-
vices, three house managers
and office support. There are
over 200 volunteers that help
the house managers from 10

Some University of Pittsburgh students will have the oppor-
tunity to work hand-in-hand with some older members of the

community Saturday.

Generations Together, a group interested in bringing
together students with older adults, is sponsoring an improvi-
sational acting workshop this weekend from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.
at the Stephen Foster Memorial Social Room.

Dr. Sally Newman, executive director of Generations
Together, said the goal of the workshop is to organize a small
theater group that will begin rehearsals this spring. 4

“We hope to bring the players together through a series of
work experiences,” Newman said. “The participants will be
involved in every aspect of the production.” 9

Newman said no acting experience or training is needed to
participate in the event, and any undergraduate or graduate
student is eligible to attend the workshop. Newman said
space is limited and reservations are strongly suggested.

A series’ of three improvisation workshops are scheduled
and will continue through May. The improvisations will focus

Robert C. Roach called home
for the past two years. '

Solemn faces have. replaced
the, “upbeat” attitude of the the
rest of the house’s residents.

And‘, according to Scott
McKnight, the 38 brothers of
Delta Sigma Phi are taking a
more -serious look at life.

The death of Roach has had a
major impact on those whose

- lives he touched and according
to Pat F.annace_, Delta Sigma Phi

is making sure the memory of
Roach will live on. Roach, a 21-
year-old senior at Pitt and
brother of Delta Sigma Phi. was
killed early Saturday morning
in a single-vehicle accident
nearhis home in Burgettstown,
Pa. .

“You take for granted the

people around you in a frater- '

nity will be there everyday and
when -they aren’t, it is very
tough,” McKnight, treasurer of
Delta Sigma Phi, said.

An avid hunter and member
of . the National Rifle
Association, Roach had
planned on going hunting on
Monday with his father and
brothers. As a tribute to their
son and brother, they followed

they got to Roach.

Roach’s brothers at Delta
Sigma Phi are paying tribute to
him in various other ways.

“We are planning to set up a
scholarship fund in his name
and possibly plant a tree in his
memory,” McKnight said.

According to Eannace, frater-
nity members wore their letters
on Wednesday in memory of

‘Roach, an act which he said

may become a tradition.

“We are trying to keep his
memory alive,” Eannace said.
“We’ve been thinking about
wearing letters every year on
Dec. 1 to honor Rob. He was a
well-liked person at the [frater-
nity] house.”

“Everyone in the house cared
a great deal about him,”
McKnight said.

According to Eannace, Roach
was Delta Sigma Phi’s rush co-
chair for the winter semester.
“He was an easy-going type of
guy; I think he would have
been successful with rush,”
Eannace said.

According to McKnight, more
than 60 brothers and alumni
from Pennsylvania and
Ohio attended Roach’s viewing
in Burgettstown Monday
evening.

“All of the brothers gave

symbol of the_ fraternity,”

Montefiore hospitals. Cleaning services
are provided as'well as linen service.
With so many beneﬁts, Family House
still only costs an average of $18 per
night. The inn costs $25 because the
rooms are doubles and have much more
space. Pat Siger, executive director of
Family House, said, “We have never
turned a needy family down if they
couldn’t afford to pay the S18.” There is
a waiting list to stay at Family House and
therefore, Siger said choosing who will
get to stay at Family House is difficult.
Siger said they base their decision on
both the severity of the illness and who
is geographically furthest from home.
A “If we have only one room left and a
kidney transplant patient from
Monroeville wants to stay at Family
House while a kidney patient from State
College also wants to stay there, we’ll

[choose the State College patient because

we have to draw the line somewhere,”
Siger said. Patients and their families are
referred by physicians, the American
Cancer Society and the American Heart
Association.

Manuel Rivera came to Family House
in 1989 while his wife Maria, had three
liver transplants back to back in 36

hours. She then remained in the hospital
for ten weeks. During. thistime, Manuel
stayed at Family House. He said that at
first he was quiet and kept to himself.
However, after a few days, the people
who had been at Family House for
months were teaching Manuel to deal
with life. They taught him to concentrate
on what was important, which wasnot
wallowing in self pity, but rather concen-
trating on helping his wife survive. Soon,
Manuel said he was the one helping new
families deal with their sorrow, and
through Family House, Manuel found a
deeper sense of family.

Since Family House is a non—profit
organization, it thrives off of charity
fundraisers, according to Siger. The
biggest money makeris the annual

We_stinghouse-Family House golf tourna-

ment which raised more than»S290,000
last year. Tliesecond largest money-
making event is the Polo Matches at
Hartwood Acres’ which raised over

S163,()O0 last year.

Pitt students have also contributed a
great deal of time and money to Family
House. The Chi Omega Sorority will be
decorating the three family houses this
weekend in the spirit of the holidays.

‘-‘Since'these families will not be home
for the holidays, we like to help them

feel as‘ at home as possible,” said Susie

Schuller, community’ service chair of Chi
Omega.

Other Greek organizations have also
contributed their time to Family House,
including Kappa Psi, Phi Kappa Sigma,
Alpha Tau ‘Delta and Theta Phi Alpha.

‘A 22-year-old boy dressed in blue
jeans and a tee shirt walks into Family
House McKee. He introduces himself to
Audrey Lazar, a volunteer. She smiles
genuinely and shows the boy to his
room. His timid body walks upstairs
where he is greeted by other guests. His
brother is in Presby recovering from a
transplant. He begins to ask Lazar ques-
tions about the inner workings of Family
House. Lazar extends answers in a gentle
manner. Slowly, he introduces himself as
Chris and the two talk about his -brother.
Lazar listens with complete patience as if
Chris were her own child.

The volunteers at Family House are
determined to make Family House into a
home-like atmosphere. Even the board
of directors is comprised of volunteers
dedicated to making Family House the
most comfortable home in Pittsburgh.

“Most people don’t realize what a
huge portion of our world comes to
Pittsburgh for complicated transplants.
Family House gives families of these

patients a place to gain strength that will,
in turn, help their loved one survive,”
said Gayland Cook, president of Integra
Bank-Pittsburgh and member of the
Board of Trustees at Family House.

Deb Hartman, who is the executive
assistant, is a mother of two, works full
time and goes to school. Whenever her
day seems to be going terribly or when
life seems too hectic, she said she simply
looks around her and realizes that noth-
ing can ‘be that bad. “When we’ll get a
call from a former guest I think ‘this is
what it’s all about’ and I realize, I’m an

individual who’s helping to make peo—-

ple’s lives run a little smoother. There’s
no better feeling in the world,” she said.

She also said that she has great respect
for the board members who ”are very
busy in their own lives, but somehow
make time to roll up their sleeves up and.
give Family House their all!”

Family House’s original partners
include the University Health_Center of

Pittsburgh, American Cancer Society, ’

Frank B. Fuhrer, R.K. Mellon

T each the young to protect themselves

Yesterday was World AIDS Day, which coincided
with the release of a report by the World Health
Organization, encouraging sex education for young
people. This report said, “Sex education frequently per-
suades young people to delay the start of sexual activi-
ty, have fewer partners and to use condoms”
(Pittsburgh Post-Gazette). While abstinence is the only
100 percent sure method of protection, education will
enable people to make the right choice and begin to

I protect-themselves at whatever age they become sexu-

ally active.

It is time for the opponents of sex education in
schools to re—examine their stance. Although Values
must be taught in the home, oftentimes all the informa-
tion necessary for young people to make intelligent
decisions is not available in the home. Since sex educa-
tion seems to delay the start of sexual activity overall,
the time has come when a consensus can be reached.

This education should take place outside the class-

room as well. It is time to use the media to reach‘

young people through mediums to which they pay
attention. ' ~ .

Musicianshave already begun to join the fight against
AIDS along with such media giants as MTV. MTV aired
videos related to AIDS awareness throughout yester-
day. Many pop and rock artists have contributed to the
fight against AIDS by playing in benefit concerts and
performing educational songs. For example, Salt ‘n
Pepa revised their song “Let’s Talk About Sex” to “Let’s
Talk About AIDS.”. .

The’ general public’s awareness about this epidemic
has increased in the past few years, but the young

‘appear to remain ignorant or are just careless. Dr.

Michael Merson of the WHO’s Global Program on AIDS
was quoted by the Pittsburgh Post—Gazette as saying:
“In many ways it is youth which are driving this epi-
demic. We don’t want our youth to die of ignorance.”

AIDS doesn’t discriminate, but people do. It is impor-
tant that the young people who will be tomorrow’s
leaders have the information to deal with this epidem-
ic. Even before they take charge they can help by one
of the most effective means, the inﬂuence on their
friends. _

They will need the knowledge to protect themselves,
and they can pass this knowledge "on to others. They
will also need to understand AIDS in order to treat its
victims with compassion. I

Education is the best way to deal withthe AIDS epi-
demic. Past experience shows people have waited too

long and known too little. The key is to let the young‘

people of the world know the truth. In this way, they
will be able to survive the epidemic and deal with it
sensibly. ’ '

Women should think for themselves

Catherine Mackinnon’s new
book, ONLY WORDS, is an
attempt to portray all women
as pitiful victims and all men
as merciless brutes. To her,
male-female relationships are
about an oppressor class ver-
sus a subordinated class.
There is no in-between.

Mackinnon is dangerous
because she couches her radi-
cal feminist argument in an
agenda of ridding the nation
of pornography and sex
crimes against women.

While the issue of pornog-
raphy is shaky because of its
many definitions, there is no
doubt that this nation must
take concrete steps to elimi-
nate all crimes, including
those against women.

But Mackinnon’s agenda
is not the equality of women
(which has largely already
been achieved), /but the
victimization of them. Some
passages from her book clear-
ly demonstrates that this is
so. A

The second sentence of
ONLY WORDS is: “You grow
up with your father holding
you down and covering your
mouth so another man can
make a horrible searing pain
between your legs.”

In her twisted and dement-
ed tale of lies, Mackinnon
attempts to link heterosexual
sex, male—female relationships
and childbirth all as part of a
male-dominated society which
leaves women in a meek and
subordinated role.

She says that women are an
oppressed class who have
bought into the male “plot”
that heterosexuality is enjoy-
able for both partners and are
still dominated by men
because of it. According to
Mackinnon there is no differ-
ence between rape and con-
sensual sex which is exactly
the kind of stupidity that is
fueling the unsubstantiated
and exaggerated nonsense
that one ‘out of every four col-

lege women is a victim of date
rape.

Rapeis a horrible crime and
it is disgusting th_at Mackinnon
demeans those women that
have actually been raped by
trivializing the act by saying
that women are “raped" if
they have sex with a man. It
sounds to me like this lady
needs a good psychiatrist.

Mackinnon continues to
spin her ‘web of deceit
by claiming that some doctors

Tony
Dickensheets

“enjoy watching and inflicting
pain during childbirth”
and raging on that sexual
harassment “begins in your
family.”

As to the issue of‘ pornogra-
phy, she says that magazines
such as Playboy are violence
against women and should be
banned.

First of all, these young
women are of the age to
decide what they want to do
with their lives, not what
some pompous, self—serving
law professor wants for them.
Many of these beautiful young
women use this’ money to
educate themselves and better
their lives. '

There is no doubt that some
magazines do cross the line of
what is art or at least done in
good taste, but even in those
the women still have a choice
(a word that Mackinnon
doesn’t seem to know) as to
what parts of their bodies they
show or what acts they per-
form.

Furthermore, do women
also “exploit” men when they
buy and look at Playgirl? Of
course not. The enjoyment of
admiring the nude bodies of
the opposite sex is as old as
civilization itself and if done

«rational decisions.

tastefully is anything but
pornography.

It is obvious that Mackinnon
doesn’t think that women in
this c'ountry are intelligent
enough to determine who
they want to date and sleep
with nor are they rational
enough to determine to pose
nude or do some other form
of “exploitive“ work.

I believe that this is non-

sense and, moreover, if a male '

were to demean the mental

‘ capacities of women the way

that Mackinnon does, they
would be branded as some
sort of sexist
Mackinnon and people like
her are attemptingto portray

WOITICU 21$ (lOCll(;‘ C1'C2l[Lll‘CS K

unable to live their lives with-
out their warped ideas.

Women need to take
responsibility for their actions
just as men do, not just make
a wrong choice and then cry
that they are victims of male
oppression.

But Mackinnon is wrong to
think that women don’t have
minds of their own and the
ability to use them to make
Women
certainly have abilities and
intelligence equal to men and
are not just helpless pawns_in
a “male-dominated” society.

To say otherwise is to set

women’s mentality back to the

days when it was thought that

women weren’t intelligent
enough to vote. That’s not
the kind of message that we
want to teach our children.

It is clear that Mackinnon is
advancing her career and
making money by betraying
and misleading twomen
instead of teaching them the

V truth — that women who‘get

an education and work har_d
are accepted into mainstream
America and succeed on their
merits. Not as victims, but as
equals.

. Dazed and Confused

Written and Directed by Richard
Linklater

With Jason London, Rory
Cochrane, Milla Jovovich,
Deena Martin, Wiley Wiggins
and a cast of hundreds.

If Dazed and Confused
wants to be a rock’n’roll movie,
,it’s.a sort of candy-assed Easy

_ Rider for the middle-America of

the ‘70s, a high school melodra-
ma where rebellion resides
mostly in the refusal to sign an
anti-drug pledge to remain on
the football team.

With kids too young to be
hippies, too middle-class to be
counter—cultural, it’s tough to
elicit anything like compelling
drama. Dazed and Confused
doesn’t even bother to try. It’s
just boys and girls with too
much time on their hands and
an endless supply of booze and
grass. Sound like a fantasy?
Yeah, you ain’t kiddin’. Dazed
serves up a slice of ‘70s teenage
life that’s so damn sugar-coated
it’s sometimes too sweet to
swallow.

The film can claim some of

the best cast bodies on ﬁlm in a

M TVS Beavis and Butt—Head Ibis Boole Suc/es
Created by Mike Judge

Written by Sam Johnson and Chris Marcil
Pocket Book, 810

Heh Heh Mmm Heh Heh, this book sucks.

No, really the title of the first book by MTV’s most
obnoxious duo, Beavis and Butt—Head is This Boole
Suc/es.

For those of you who thought the two were becom—
ing a little too tame, have no fear: in this book anything
is open for commentary by the little weinerheads.

' The “introsuction” beginsby telling who these two
dudes are (as if anyone didn’t know). _

The “Family Bush” gives an idea of where these two
came from, but very little is learned from examining
this complex diagram of people who look curiously
like Beavis and Butt—Head.

The photo album section of the book is an opportu-
nity to trace the roots of Beavis and Butt-I-lead’s behav-
ior back to birth:

°Butt-Head at “Age 0” sticking his bottle up his nose.

-Beavis at age 4 rockin’ to his ABCS.

-Beavis and Butt-Head taking their first fishing trip
together at age 4 and using M-80s to catch carp.

-Beavis at age 5 pouring lighter fluid on the candles
on his cake.

-Butt—Head at age 7 standing in front of a trap he set

up for Santa at the bottom of his fireplace.

Those who don’t like the references the show makes
to fire should definitely not read the book. Beavis is as

 obsessed with fire as ever.

When illustrating “The Hysterectomy of the World,” a
special note is made of the year 20 million B.C. when
fire was invented.

The two can be found destroying everything from

each other’s heads to smashing in a mailbox with their .

always handy bats.

On a lighter note, a section of the book entitled “Hi
Koo” is devoted to poetry written by the two.

Just a little teaser:

“Heh Heh Mmm Heh Heh

Butt—Head cracked a big stiffy

Looking at Baywatch.”

Throughout the book other characters from the TV
show make guest appearances, including Daria,'Stewart
and Mr. Anderson. These other characters play their
usual support role, mainly to be the target of classic
Beavis and Butt—Head jokes. '

The book spends more time dealing with the inside
lives of Beavis and Butt—Head than the TV show and
attempts to show who these two really are. In other
words, it gives the characters more depth than people

Mrs. Doubtfire

Starring Robin Williams
With Sally Field

Directed by Chris Columbus

Tony Curtis and Jack
Lemmon did it in Some L2’/ee it
Hot, Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie.
Now Robin Williams gets his
shot at laughs via cross—dressing
in the Chris Columbus (Home
Alone)-directed Mrs. Dozthzﬁre.
As farlas comedy goes, it’s an
ancient and oft-used ploy, but
Williams manages to make it a
big darn guffaw.

Williams plays Daniel Hillard,
an out-of-work actor, father and
recent divorcee who is forbid-
den to see his children. Out of
desperation, Hillard dons the
disguise of a typical frumpy, but
sweet British nanny and gets
hired by his unsuspecting ex-
wife (Sally Field) to clean house
and babysit. This premise pro-
vides the stage for two hours of
Williams’ best har—de-har com-
bined with the usual which
bathroom should I go in and
giant bra—on—a-guy jokes.

Like most comedies, Mrs.
Doubtfire relies on types for its
laugh generation, _ which works
as well here as it does any-
where else. However, reducing
all your characters to ﬂaky c_ari-
cature shells does have its ﬂip
side of negative connotations.
Daniel’s gay brother Frank
(Harvey Fierstein) and his lover
are presented as generic quee-
ny novelties. The entire point of
making these characters gay
seemed to be for laughs, a
reminder that the folks with the
funds are still uncomfortable
with a gay character who is just
an average Joe.

Sally Field’s career—oriented

‘mother character is a hard— _

assed, humorless near-villain
with little time for her children,
an obviously less than ﬂattering
picture of working moms. Mrs.
Doubtfire herself is someone’s
inﬂatedly prissy idea of spins-
terdom. Although these stereo-

Mrs. Doubtfire also gives a
brief nod to the pain children
caught in the middle of divorces
have to endure, but this aspect
is a mere afterthought to
Williams’ performance. The bla-

decidedly out of place in light
of the rest of the picture.

Now that you’ve read about

' Tiger Trap

Sour Grass
K Records

When one of my roommates
first brought home the new

' Tiger Trap EP, Sour Grass, we

predicted that a video for the
title track would surely soon fol-
low. ' _

Songs just couldn’t be as
catchy and poppy as “Sour
Grass” and not be released as a

. single and. immortalized for pos-

terity in video. Sure enough, the
band has made a video and
with the recent ﬂux of MTV air-

play Unrest’s “Make Out Club”
has been getting, it won’t be
long before everyone’s favorite
four young women from
Sacramento are singing their
way into your living room.

The super-hyped girl rock
sensation have overcome their
second-release slump with a
five—song EP packed with catchy
guitar r-iffs and caramel—covered
vo_cals; Last year’s "self-entitled
album was a favorite on campus
airwaves. With songs like
“Puzzle Pieces,” “Words and
Smiles” and “For Sure,” Rose,
Angela, Jen and Heatlier kicked

sounclsouncl

their way into our hearts with a
cheerful repetitive sound that
makes you wanna crawl in bed
with Fluffy, throw the covers
over your head and hum along.
Tiger,Trap’s sound is mostly
modern lullaby and Sour Grass
delivers more of the same mate-
rial that the first album
spawned.

The opening aforementioned
track has all the traditional trim-

mings of a pop song.

A blissful tune about seeing
the glass as half full, it cele-
brates euphoric love and

Pearl lam

Pearl Jam
Vs.
Sony

Jim Morrison is dead.

F—king gone.

Eddie Vedder lives.

Vedder lives — Pearl Jam's front man and resi-
dent tortured soul positively sits atop the rock
music world that simultaneously turns his stom-
ach and fuels his creative fire.

The two icons have been compared and con-
trasted by the same people, it seems, who have a
habit of grilling the band unmercifully because of
their commercial success: both are dark, mysteri-
ous, poetic and controversial 

But a big difference — one much greater than
their similarities — exists between them: Morrison
drowned himself in a pool of a self—obsessed obe-
sity and self-indulgent sickness.

' Vedder, however, is caught in a whirlpool of
the sorrows and problems of Generation X —
problems he experienced throughout his child-
hood and now bears upon his miniscule shoul-
ders. .

Those problems keep cropping up, it seems, in
a different form — in a total lack of respect from a
hypocritical media that tries to not only label the
band and their music, but also criticizes them for
their success and record sales.

Are they sell-outs because millions of people
have bought their records andflock to their

shows? Or do they take themselves too seriously
because of their obvious lack of desire to appear
on every television show and every magazine
cover?

No and no.

The lyrics on Pearl Jam’s latest, Vs., drip with
this malaise that Vedder, through tired interviews
and countless evaluations, communicates to his
followers with an undeniable feeling of “We’ve all
been there, man.”

The album ‘establishes itself early with a pair of
intense numbers, “Go”, a warm-up for later rock-
ers and “Animal,” a song which the band per-

. formed live on- MTV.

The latter epitomizes the conundrum that exists
in Vedder’s poetry. .

At first glance, the album — superior to its pre-

decessor musically with a mix of wah-wahs and
improved drumming -—‘— seems to be lyrically
weaker. But, after repeated play, the words take
on stronger meanings.

While Vedder screams “1-2-3-4-5 against one,”
he also, with a simplistic beauty, bemoans to his
enemies: “Why do you want to hurt me?/So fright-
ened of your face.”

“Daughter,” which some have argued is the fol-
low-up to Ten’s “Why Go,” enters with Stone
Gossard’s acoustic guitar and is quickly kick—start-

ed by Dave Abbruzzese’s drums, which echo. V

through this album with an unquenchable fury.

Vedder sings: “Mother reads aloud/ Child tries to
understand it/Tries to make her proud.”

Gossard’s soothing acoustic underneath under-
lies Mike McCready’s wailing strings.”

“The shades go down in her room/You can’t
deny there’s something wrong 

Vedder, who connected with “Alive” —- a song _
he often introduces in performances with the ,
phrase “It’s a great time to be alive” — connects

The show spends a lot of
its time with the two watch-
ing videos and making their
famous opinions known —
“this sucks” or “this is cool.”

‘The book spends a lot of its

time giving background
information on the two from
the time they were born all
thelway up to when they are
overweight adults looking
back on the way they
became pop icons.

The book tells the critics of
Beavis and Butt-Head who

say they are bad role models
to kids, “She said model.
Does she want to see us in
our swimsuits?” This
response in the book is a
perfect way to tell those peo-

two for their kids behavior
that they should get off their
backs and let them sit in
their couch in peace.

once again with the suicidal
“Rearviewmirror.” _

Maybe the most driving song on the
album, “Rearviewmirror” begins several
notches above “Alive”. — Gossardis
rhythm and Abbruzzese’s drumming
keeps the flow tight throughout as
Vedder wails: '

“I took a drive today/Time to emanci-
pate/I think it was the beatings_made me
wise/I’m not about to give thanks’ to
apologies.” _

The band misses with “Rats” and

I “Gloriﬁed g,” a pair of songs that, by Pearl

Jam’s standards, just don’t measure up —
lyrically in the case’ of “Glorified g,” musi-
cally in the case of “Rats.” ~

But the two take nothing-away from the
power and substance of the album, as it

grows increasingly stronger with each

song.
“Dissident” indirectly showcases
Vedder’s power vocally, while

Abbruzzese’s tribal, almost primal beats
highlights “W.M.A.” — a song about
police brutality that strikes at the very
chord most of the lives of Pearl Jam’s lis-
teners are built on: “He won the
lottery/By being born/Big Hand slapped
a White American,” he sings. “Police
stopped my brother again.”

Combined with the self-pitying
“Blood,” in which Vedder questions the
motives_ and actions of the media, “Leash”
seems to sum up the attitude the band
has with it’s.fans:

“Troubled souls unite/We got ourselves
tonight/I am lost/... But I’m by your
side,” Vedder screams atop a tough Jeff

Ament bass line. ,

“Drop the leash, drop the leash/Get out
of my f—king face.’’»

The albumcloses with “Indifference,”
the album’s most powerful song.

A little bass, a laid back guitar, and
Vedder, pouring his heart out with an atti-
tude of “f—k you” defiance:

“I will make my way throughone more ‘

day/I will hold the candle, until it burns
up my arm/I’ll keep taking punches, until
their will grows tired/‘I will stand the sun
down until my eyes go blind.”

It’s this unmistakable resilience that dri-
ves the band and tlieir music, and keeps
comparable groups just a step behind

Dazed

Continued from page S-3

wraps this cast inside a package
of music from Foghat, Deep

.Purple, Ted Nugent, Black

Sabbath, GTO’s, Chevelle’s,

Roadrunners and hopped up El

Camino’s and lets it roll. It’s cars
and guitars big enough and-
loud enough but with the
annoying habit of muting the
volume before the first verse in
a song ends in favor of some
ridiculous pothead dialogue.
Play the music, Dick. Linklater
does give a glimpse of a deeper
wit, :1 la Tarantino, as “Why
Can’t We Just Be Friends”-plays
over top of a hazing scene
where the seniors work over a
group of freshman.

This hazing business is basi-
drives
plot,though more like a Pinto
than 21 Mustang. And in this
world the seniors terrorizing the
little ones’ are basically just nice
kids carrying on some asinine
tradition that Linklater spends a
lot of film stock on. Hell, even
the one real jerk inthe movie,
O’Bannion (Ben Affleck), gets
his comeuppance and things
stay nice and just.

Too bad for Linklater that his ‘
film is so well cast. The kids
look real enough, act real
enough, they just exist in some
candy—assed reality.‘ Oh, there’s
one fistfight and some name-
calling, but there’s a lot of vio-
lence missing from this picture.
Nobody gets ripped off or
arrested, nobody overdoses or
wrecks a car. At least give
somebody: a damn: speeding:
ticket. Worse yet there’s really
no sex. Maybe that’s Linklater’s

cally what the

‘experience, but with all the

innuendo, bodies and hor- ‘
mones that flash through this
film, combined with an exag-
gerated sense of the permissive
society that reached middle-
America in the ‘70s, somebody’s
gotta get laid.

Maybe, like other mythical
summers, Linklater’s summer of
drugs is remembered as he
wants it to be,‘ and I’m sure at
times was. But without the risk

there ain’.t much glamour and

things begin to look silly.
Dazed just completely denies
any down side. Maybe there’s
some wisdom in that seeing as
how sexual permissiveness and
the establishment of a drug cul-
ture in the ‘60s and ‘70s has left
us with AIDS and 12-step pro-
grams in the ‘80s and ‘90s. But
that’s much too heady and infi-
nitely debatable a proposition
to pull from a film like this.

. Besides, rock’n’roll is about

youth, excess and consumption.
Dazed and Confused sure has a
little of this and there’s always a
healthy dose of those cars and
guitars to guarantee you a little
teenage fun. Who the hell
doesn’t need some of that?

Panthers plunder Red Flash, 88-69

Pitt's starters
too much for
Deon George
and St. Francis

By Brian Gallagher

Sports Editor

Five against one.

In ever—changing pop culture
(circa 1993), it’s the “us against

‘ the world” battle cry of Toe Jam
— that quintet of bitter Seattle
grunge known to most teen
angst folk as Pearl Jam.

On 94 feet of stable hard-
wood — a.k.‘a. basketball court
— it’s a surefire way to an
embarrassing, one-sided defeat.

Such was the case last night
at the Field House, where Pitt
improved to 2-0 on the young
season with an 88-69 pasting of

. Northeast Conference staple St.

Francis. 2

Spurred by the sporadicbut
ultimately effective play of
its starting five, the Panthers
hammered a Red Flash squad
that survived much of
the December night on the
efforts "of one man —— Deon
George.

George, a 6-foot-5-inch for-
ward, racked up a game high
25 points for St. Francis (0-1).
Unfortunately for the senior
slasher from Canada, his one-
man show ran smack into. for-
wards Chris Gant (17 points, 17
rebounds), Orlando. Antiqua

  Bulked-up

By Jason Brarne
Asst. Sports Editor

Will Cauley came into
Pittsburgh with the pomp and
circumstance of a vaunted talent
and the position of power for-
ward virtually guaranteed to
him by media and fans.

Chris Gant didn’t. The resi-
dent sixth, seventh, or eighth-
man of last year’s Panther squad
was now the forgotten man —
the “oh-yeah, him” guy that
people thought could throw
down a couple of dunks and
yell real loud.

Guess what? Gant has done
more than dunk. After playing
well against Youngstown St.,
the senior erupted for a double-
double game (17 points and 17
boards) against St. Francis last
night and, for all intents and
purposes, snared the power for-
ward position like such a
_rebound.

“This was probably the best
that Chris has ever done -
most minutes, most rebounds,
most points,” Pitt head coach
Paul Evans said.

“He’s in much better condi-
tion thanfhe ever was. He
showed some spurts his first
couple of years that he could do

' some good things — he could

rebound — and now he’s in

Mart Serlin/The Pitt News

Jery McCullough manuvers for two of his 20 points.

(11 points, 12 rebounds) and
the rest of Pitt’s starting five.

The results? But for a few
tense moments ‘ midway
through the second half, as pre-
dictable as the aforementioned
five-to-one matchup: one-
sided.

Pitt sprinted out to a 14-2
advantage just three minutes

into the game, gettingsix early

points from center Eric Mobley '

(20 points, 10 rebounds) to go
with a pair of buckets each
from Ahmad Shareef and Gant.
The lead grew to 21 at the half
(47-26) on a pair of free throws
by Jerry McCullough (20 points,

11 assists).

“The first half, we played

 

pretty well, we executed pretty
well,” Pitt head coach Paul
Evans said.

Then came the tense
moment, midway through the
second half.

With Pitt ‘comfortably ahead
65-45, George and the Red
Flash did its best*Vinnie
Johnson impersonation, chalk-
ing up 14 unanswered points

.team in a three—minute span —

“In the second half, we
became the aggressor, we took
the initiative e the fear went
out of our game,” St. Francis
head coach Tom McConnell
said. “Good things started to
happen.”
- Coach Evans had a different

take on the second 20 minutes.-

“In the second half, I think
they must have thought it was
too easy,” Evans said.

Things got back to the pre-
dictable plotline moments after
the run as Evans put his starters

back on the floor to finish what.

the subs couldn’t.

Pitt closed the remaining 6:30
on a 23-10 gallop led by
McCul1ough’s eight point out-
burst.

Game, set, match.

Almost as expected.

“The subs didn’t do us any
good when they went in, but
the first group did a goodjob of
coming back,” Evans said.

much better shape.”

.“_I’m not really surprised,”
Gant said of his immediate
impact. “I knew I could do it
but over the summer I did a lot
of things to better myself. My
first two years I knew I was
behind [former power forward]
Chris McNeal and now I know
it’s my turn and I’m trying to
shine.

“I took everything a lot more
-seriously this year. Before the
season even started and I ran
around Oakland so -I was ready
to get in shape this year -— I
was looking forward to the sea-
son.”

Center Eric Mobley agreed: “I
don’t think [that’s it’s a big sur-
prise] because in pre-season he
seemed like he was really seri-
ous about getting in shape,” he
said. “Plus he knows the offense
-a lot better from last year.”

That might be the bigger rea-
son Gant is seeing more min-
utes this year than he did his
previous two.

Cauley was long awaited as
the climactic successor of Brian
Shorter, Pitt’s last true dominat-
ing power forward. But for
whatever reason — a lack of
shooting touch, lack of knowl-
edge of the offense or confu-
sion about his position — he

In the finals of the Big

against Seton Hall, Pitt’s
volleyball team (23-10)
rallied from a 2-0 deficit
to a five-game victory.

' Last night in the first
round of the NCAA
Tournament at George
Washington (28-7), the
Panthers rallied again, but
lost a tight fifth game, 15-
13. ’ ’

The same problems that
hurt Pitt all night were
costly in the fifth game.

“Serving and ‘serve
receive —— we did not
have one of our stronger
matches in those areas,”
Pitt head coach Cindy
_Braziel said. “Serve
receiving was our biggest
ﬂaw in the match.”

In game one, the
Panthers used a balanced
attack to build an 11-3
lead, but could not hold
it. The Colonials chipped
away" and pulled within
13-9 when 2
Washington’s Liu Li went
back to serve.

Li has a unique side-
arm serve that Pitt had
trouble returning all night.
She had six aces in the
match, three of them
coming in a six-point run
that gave the Colonials a
15-13 game one victory.

“That was probably the
match in some regard,”
Braziel said. “That was a
big psychological swing
on both sides.”

The Panthers did a bet-
ter job holding their lead
ingame two, a 15-10 Pitt
victory. Sarah Mikla-and
Sara Mitchell stuffed top

GW attacker Svetlana

Vtyurina for the game-
winning point.

Despite solid blocking
at times by Pitt, Vtyurina
was dominating at times
for the Colonials, pound-
ing out 29 kills in the
match.

“When you have some-
one with that kind of
physical size — you can’t
stop somebody like that,”
Braziel said.

The teams split the next
two games, setting up the
rally-scored fifth game.

“Who made the fewest
unforced errors [won,]”
Braziel said.

Despite a hand injury,
Ann Marie Lucanie ended
her career at Pitt with a
27-kill match.

THE PI'I'I‘ NEWS Thursda December 2 1

Swim hopes to cap strong first half at Pitt Invite

By Brady Slater
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s and women’s
swimming and diving teams try
to put exclamation marks on
impressive first halves of their
seasons at the eighth annual Pitt
Invitational beginning tonight at
Trees Pool.

The men are undefeated in
duel meets at 5-0 and are trying
to win their second consecutive
Pitt Invite.

The women haven’t won the
invite since 1988, but are 3-2
under new coach Marian
Cassidy, a record that includes
somewhat surprising wins over
Big East rivals Syracuse and
Miami.

Joining Pitt at the invite are:
James Madison, Buffalo, Miami
of Ohio, Kenyon and Oberlin.

Not exactly big-name schools,
but Cassidy insists name isn’t
everything. ,

‘‘All the schools have very
strong teams,” Cassidy said. “We
want to bring in. strong competi-
tion.”

The men’s team will be swim-
ming a little lighter, but not
because they shaved for the
meet. .
Senior captain Matt Brady,
sophomore Aaron Fortner and
head coach Chuck Knoles will
not be at the invite and under-
standably so — they’ll be at the
U.S. Swimming Open in Ann
Arbor, Mich.

“It definitely takes something.

away,” assistant coach David
Amato said. ' \

“Matt and Aaron probably
would have won their respec-
tive events.”

Amato said he’s looking for
other swimmers to step up in
the wake of their stars’
absences, in particular sopho-
more Chris Perry in the individ-
ual medley and sophomore
Chris Balke in the backstroke —-—
races that Brady usually wins —
and junior Jeff Novotny in the
butterfly, which is Fortner’s
stroke.

Regardless of the slimmer ros-
ter for the invitational, Amato
said he expects the team to do
well.

Cassidy doesn’t ‘appear to be
as conﬁdent as Amato regarding
her team’s chances.

‘‘We’re at a disadvantage in
numbers,” Cassidy said.

“For example, Miami’s roster
is double the size of ours, 31 to
16.”

And since the rules_of the

invite allow for each school to
enter an unlimited number of
swimmers into each event, she
may be right.

But it’s not as if her and her
swimmers are conceding any-
thing. -

“This is the second biggest
meet of the year for us,” Cassidy
said.

‘‘We’re rested, not a full

-taper, but tested, and we should

be sharper than we were in the
duel lT‘.«f‘.€[S. We want to do our
best.”

The invite begins at 7 p.m.
tonight with the finals of the
1650 freestyle and the 800
freestyle relay. C

The schedule for Friday and
Saturday mirror each other with
preliminaries beginning at 10
a.m., finals coming at 6:30 p.m.
in the evening.

has not had the impact that
many thought he would.

“I thought [Cauley] could
shoot the ball,” Evans said. “I
think he’s lifting too much or
something but we’ve got to
get him stretched .out
-because he’s got to make a
one—foot shot. He’s maybe
trying too hard at this point.”

“I’m not going to knock
anybody — I knew lCauleyl
played my position so I said
to myself that I would work
for it,” Gant said. “I thought
that there would be a big
battle so I just wanted to
work harder at this position.”

“I. think that Will, lCauleyl
has to know the role for the
position and right now Chris
[McNeal] really knows and
he’s getting the, go—ahead,”
Mobley said. “I think that if
Willie can watch film and
know that he’s going to play
the four [power forward] the
whole time he can see what
Chris Bennett’s [Gant] doing
and maybe get some more
playing time. That’s the only
problem that I think he has
— he just doesn’t know what
the four’s supposed to do
and Chris knows what he’s

. doing.”

Unfortunately for Cauley, if
Gant keeps putting up the
numbers those minutes just

won’t be there.

-This weekend in men’s
basketball:

When Pitt faces the
Providence Friars come
Saturday, they will see what
is possibly the best front
court in the Big East confer-
ence as Dickey Simpkins
and Micheal Smith, a pair of
rebounding machines, tram-
ple into Fitzgerald Field
Hose for the Big East opener.

“It’s like gut—check to see if
we’re really ready,” Gant
said. “I think the next two
days that’s something we’re
gonna work on as far as
rebounding and post-
defense because they have
one of the best, if not the
best, front lines in the Big
East. »

“In practice we’re gonna
try to minimize some of the
stuff, look at the film and see
what mistakes we’re making.
Hopefully we won’t make as
many turnovers against
Providence.”

Mobley said that neither he
nor the team is not playing at
optimum level: “I don’t think
I’m where I want to be,” he
said. “I don’t think we’re
where we should be. I think
it’s important that we focus
in practice -- we can’t let a
team like St. Francis come
back and get into the game.”

  Panthers

Continued from page 7

“They played some good
defense.”

Pitt retums to action Saturday
when Big East foe Providence
comes to Fitzgerald. Michael
Smith, Dickey Simpkins and the
rest of the Friars tip it off with
the Panthers beginning at 12

 

noon.
PITT NOTES: Pitt out
rebounded St. Francis, 67-31,
but committed 30 turnovers to
just 10 by the Red Flash.
McCullough reached a career-
best with his 11 assists. He also
had 11 turnovers.
Walk-on Shaun Koontz

played the final minutes and hit
a lay-up.

Frosh Sotiris Aggelou had a
rough night from three-point
range, hitting just one of eight
attempts.

Pitt shot 49 percent from the
field. St. Francis? Just 29 percent
