Medical students get
forum on specialties

By Brendan Kevenides
For The Pitt News

Medical students had no formal
counseling concerning a path to
follow toward specialization, un-
til now.

”Emergency Medicine
Specialty Night,” presented by
the University of Pittsburgh Af-
filiated Residency in Emergency
Medicine, recently presented a
program designed to educate and
inform medical students about an
area in which they might choose
to specialize —— in this case, emer-
gency medicine.

”This is a pilot of an experi-
ment,” said John Mahoney, na-
tional liaison from the American
Medical Student Association to
Emergency Medicine Residents’
Association/American College of
Emergency Physicians. ”I hope
that this trial program can serve
as a model for other medical
schools to sponsor similar
events.”

Mahoney explained that, in the
past, usually a few students al-
ready interested in a specific
field, i.e. pediatrics, would gather
at a physician's home and discuss
the topic of interest. He said that
the disadvantage of this process

is that a small, anonymous group
would feel ”trapped” and only
get one physician's point of view.

According to Mahoney, the
presentation offered students the
opportunity to listen to and ques-
tion a large number of residents
at different levels in their careers.
It also provided first— and second-
year medical students with an
awareness of opportunities in
fields that they would not or-
dinarily encounter until their
third or fourth years when it may
be to late to pursue them.

Mahoney also said that pro-
grams like this make students
more competitive and that the
free food and large forum pro-
vides a relaxed atmosphere for
students.

Dr. Paul M. Paris, program
director of the University of Pitts-
burgh Affiliated Residency in
Emergency Medicine, stated that
before this program, many peo-
ple may not have even recog-
nized emergency medicine as a
specialty.

’’In the past, emergency rooms
were staffed by misfits,” com-
mented Paris. He said that this
kind of program will help
residency programs dig up the
better students.

Tax bill meets stiff
opposition in house

By Rod Snyder

Associated Press Writer

HARRISBURG —- Floor de-
bate on tax reform legislation
moved into its second day in
the House as Democratic lead-
ers on Wednesday attempted
to thwart a flood of proposed
changes to the package.

The House rejected several
of the roughly 50 amendments
to the legislation that is a fine-
tuning of Gov. Robert P.
Casey's tax reform plan. The
lawmakers started their session
an hour earlier than usual af-
ter getting through about half
of the amendments during five
hours of debate Tuesday.

Under the proposal, many
so-called nuisance taxes
would be eliminated and
property taxes would be tar-
geted for reductions. It would
let local officials substitute
other taxes —— such as a sales
or income levy — for a portion
of the property tax.

The House debate included
extensive consideration of a
provision in the bill that would

allow municipalities to impose
a 0.1 percent services levy on
the wages of commuters who
work in their community.

Opponents of the proposed
tax have complained it
amounts to a ”commuter tax”
because it would be imposed
on people who live outside a
municipality but travel there to
work.

Current law allows all
municipalities except Philadel-
phia to collect a $10 occupa-
tional privilege tax on
commuters. Philadelphia col-
lects a controversial wage tax.

On Tuesday, the House
defeated an amendment that
would have eliminated the
municipal services tax from
the legislation, but supporters
of that proposal said they
would attempt to bring it up
for another vote.

Another amendment,
defeated I56-39, would have
replaced the percentage tax
with a flat) $20 levy.

Washington County Democrat

chosen as the first site of this ex-

BETHLEHEM, Occupied West
Bank —-— Israeli soldiers shot and
wounded six Palestinians, and
Arabs with slingshots, stones and
marbles injured five Israelis in
battles Wednesday in the West

Bank, witnesses and officials said-

Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
rebuffed a call from Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak for a
six-month freeze on Jewish settle-
ments in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip as a prelude to
peace talks.

During a visit to a West Bank
settlement, Shamir told Jewish
settlers he hoped their communi-
ties ’’will grow and prosper.”

Asked what advice he would
give to Jewish settlers to deal with
the unrest, Shamir said: ”Be
strong." Asked what he would
advise Palestinians, Shamir said:
”Be quiet.”

At least 42'Arabs have been
killed since clashes broke out
Dec. 8. The latest death occurred
Tuesday night when a 24-year-
old Arab woman shot in the head

that Pittsburgh has "a great medi-

”Pitt’s friendly. Pitt cares.”

’’It is really nice to have a

Christopher White, M.D., a chief
resident for the University of Pitts-

hem used slingshots to fire metal
scraps, marbles and stones at
soldiers. The army fought back
with tear gas, rubber bullets and
live warning shots before impos-
ing a curfew.

One soldier was injured when
he was hit in the nose while ad-
vancing on protesters.

Arab residents said the trouble
started after soldiers beat people
during a raid on the camp.

The army said two Israeli
civilians were hurt when stones
were thrown at passing cars on
the outskirts of Bethlehem. The
army said Israeli passengers got
out and threw stones back at Arab
protesters.

Three Arabs were shot in the
legs in the village of Silwad near
Ramallah, and three others were
slightly wounded in Duraa near
Hebron after Arab youths tried to
break into a municipal building,
the military said.

Mohsin Salah, 19, told The As-
sociated Press from his bed in
Ramallah, Hospital that the Sil-
wad clash occurred after several
hundred Palestinians rushed to
the village's high school when a
rumor spread that Israeli settlers
were trying to take five boys.

Salah said, the soldiers opened

Elsewhere, Israeli commuter
I)uses and a passenger train were
pelted with stones, the army said.
A civilian and a border police-
man were hurt.

In a separate incident, Arabs
hurled rocks at a bus carrying
Jewish settlers past the Dheishe
refugee camp on the way to
Jerusalem. ”Every window was
broken. Everybody made the rest
of the trip lying on the floor," said
Rabbi Yechiel M. Leiter, a settle-
ment leader who lives in Hebron.

Leiter told The Associated Press
that settlers also were making
”citizens’ arrests,” by picking up
children they thought were
throwing stones and dropping
them off at military headquarters.

Israel Radio said Jewish settlers
in the West Bank sent a message
to Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin, threatening to retaliate for
Arab attacks on Israeli cars.

Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna,
commander of troops in the West
Bank, told reporters during a tour
of Nablus that he would not toler-

Court rules payment for surrogate mothers illegal

TRENTON, N.J. — New Jer-
sey's highest court ruled Wednes-
day that hiring a surrogate mother
amounts to illegal ”baby selling”

and said that the mother of the 1

child once known as Baby M
cannot be denied the right to visit
her daughter.

The New Jersey Supreme Court
said that the child’s father, Wil-
liam Stern, can retain custody of
the 22-month-old child but that
Mary Beth V\/hitehead-Gould
maintains her rights as a parent.

”Our law prohibits paying or
accepting money in connection
with any placement of a child for
adoption," the court said. ”Baby
selling potentially results in the
exploitation of all parties in-
volved.”

The. court, in a 7-0 decision,
said that payment in a surrogacy
contract is ’’illegal and perhaps
criminal.”

3 U.S. soldiers arrested

after cocaine found

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -
Three Americansoldiers and a
Panamanian were arrested after
77 pounds of cocaine were found

in a U.S. military plane they flew
from Panama, a customs official
said Wednesday.

The four, all wearing U.S.
Army uniforms, were detained at
Roosevelt Roads Naval Station af-
ter the drug was found Saturday
during a routine customs check,
Mamie Pollock, U.S. Customs
regional director, said.

She said the probe was in the
hands of the Drug Enforcement
Administration and the U.S. At-
torney’s office.

Customs agents, assisted by
drug-sniffing dogs, seized about
77 pounds of cocaine with a
wholesale value of $350,000 to
$420,000, DEA Special Agent Ar-
thur Barnes said in a telephone
interview today.

A spokesman at Roosevelt
Roads, on Puerto Rico's east
coast, said no Navy personnel
were involved, and the pilot and
crew were not arrested.

Pa. Senate committee

HARRISBURG — With law-
makers’ offices taking hundreds

NEWS BRIEFS

tee approved a bill Wednesday to
block the proposed 200 percent
increase in the annual fee
charged by the Catastrophic Loss
Trust Fund.

The bill, approved unanimous—.

ly by the Senate Banking and In-
surance Committee, would keep
the fee at its current $8 for the rest
of 1988. The CAT Fund board
would have to set the fee by Jan.
1 of each year beginning in 1989.

Committee chairman Edwin
Holl, R-Montgomery, said the bill
will move quickly through both
the House and Senate.

”The bottom line is we're go-
ing to get quick action on retain-
ing the $8 fee," Holl said. ”The
Legislature can no longer
procrastinate.”

Committee members said their
offices have received hundreds of
calls opposing the new $24 an-
nual fee since it was approved
5-3 Monday by the CAT Fund
board. The fee, to take effect Oct.
1, still must be reviewed by the

Commission.

Pa. examining mishap
at local nursing home

PITTSBURGH — The state
Welfare Department said Wed-
nesday it is investigating severe
burns suffered by a 79-year-old
woman who apparently fell out
of her bed at a boarding home
and lay against a hot radiator.

Adeline Napolitano was in seri-
ous condition Wednesday at
Mercy Hospital, where she was
admitted Jan. 26, said hospital
spokesman Kris Mamula.

Napolitano was burned at Lim-
berg’s Personal Care Home in
Carrick, which Welfare Depart-
ment spokesman Leroy Hedg-
epeth said is under investigation.

”From the depth and severity
of the bums, it appears that she
lay against the radiator for at least
an hour or longer,” said Dr. Mary
Jeanne Krob, director of the
hospital’s burn center. ”Some of
the bums go through her muscles
and to the bones.”

Hilda Limberg, 72, who oper-
ates the home, said she provided

Murphy paid law bill
with campaign funds

WASHINGTON — Rep. Austin
Murphy, D-Pa., used $19,000 in
campaign funds to pay legal fees
associated with the ethics hear-
ings that led to his reprimand by
the House, according to cam-
paign finance records.

Murphy, who Iast December
became. the first member dis-
ciplined by the House in more
than three years, also used his
own money on his legal defense,
aides said Wednesday.

Even after Congress tightened
the guidelines on campaign com-
mittee expenditures, the FEC has
granted members leeway in cases
similar to Murphy's.

, Exploring other /.
information sources

Recently, there has been considerable discussion in the public *’
sector about the ethics and limitations that should apply to the

media.

, Last week, the incident of choice was the CBS Evening News
segment containing the verbal give-and—give between anchor
Dan Rather and Vice President George Bush. Depending on
your source of information, either Rather was serving a valua-
ble function for the benefit of his viewers, or Bush was show-
ing that the media should not have as much power and prestige

as it currently enjoys.

This week, the word from the front lines of the media vs.
everybody war is the decision by three major networks (NBC,
CBS and ABC), not to carry President Reagan's speech urging
Americans to supportthe Contra aid package. There were cries
that the media was censoring the information available to the
public, something any news organization does possibly
hundreds of time each day when it decides on its editorial con-

tent for the day.

From the vantage point of a television viewer, who depends
solely on the tube for his or her information, each news pro-
gram is an exercise in censorship. Before complaining too loudly
that the public is subject to the whims of the media, perhaps
the current critics of the television news should explore other,
and more complete, information sources.

In a nutshell 

The third party made its avatar in Wallace, three
goose-steps to the right of Nixon.

Once upon a time, there was
a neighborhooddivided intotwo
sides that got into a lot of fights.
One side consisted of a loud-
mouthed bully named Ivan and
a bunch of pipsqueak friends
who loved to beat up other peo-
ple. The other side was made up
of a bunch of guys who only
wanted everyone to have as
much fun as they could at no-
body _,e|se’s expense. The fun-
loving guy's leader was named
Sam. Sam was a pretty big guy
who just loved to help other peo-
ple out when he could — he
didn't want anyone to get hurt.

One day, both sides got into a
pretty big fight and beat each
other up pretty badly, so that
most of them had to go to the
hospital and get stitches when the
fight was over. The altercation
really didn't settle anything, but
it made both sides hate each
other even more.

Sam felt really bad that his
friends had been beaten up, so he
started collecting some rocks and

He told his friends that if the bul-

Ivan saw what Sam was doing,
so he started collecting his own
rocks and giving them to his co-
horts, telling them that if Sam's
friends started throwing rocks,
then they should throw them
back. ,

The parents of Sam's friends
were shocked when they found
out that Sam had passed out
stones because they could really
hurt someone, so they told their
kids that they should get rid of the
stones. Sam went to each of his
friends’ houses and told the par-
ents that the stones were only for
self-defense, and they weren't go-
ing to throw the stones unless the
bullies started a fight. Besides,
Sam told them, no one had got-

Watching George Gee conduct
the Make-Believe Ballroom Or-
chestra is similar to observing a
whirling musical dynamo. The
pleasant but powerful King of
Pittsburgh Swing regains his right-
ful throne this Friday night at 9
p.m. at a free show in CMU’s Ski-
bo Ballroom.

Gee retains a certain nostalgia
about playing his alma mater.
The original lineup of his band
formed as a result of competing
in and handily winning a gong
show at the 1980 Carnegie Mel-
lon Spring Carnival. Gee also
hosted the ”Make-Believe Ball-
room” radio show on WRCT. Af-
ter graduating, George expanded
his orchestra into an T8-piece
swing band with two vocalists.

He gives a great deal of credit

IOIOIOO

to the wonderful people of the
city of Pittsburgh who, represent-
ed by the readers of In Pittsburgh
magazine, voted his group the
most popular jazz band of 1986
and the best big band in 1987.
He lost the title of best overall
band by only a few votes to the
college—oriented Affordable
Floors.

”Pittsburghers are supportive of
what we do and consider us their
pride and joy. We appreciate that
immensely,” said Gee.

Local accolades are only the tip
of the iceberg for the Make-
Believe Ballroom Orchestra,
which has played regular engage-
ments at respected New York
venues such as the Cat Club and
the Apollo Theatre, where ex-
posure is important.

Constant live appearances have
led to a series of '80s firsts for a
40’s—sty|e hand. Two years ago,

' ' ' ' LAO
LLAAOLOLLOLOA
A

the orchestra was filmed in Pitts-
burgh for the first big-band per-
formance on MTV. Gee is also
behind the first big-band video to
be aired on MTV, promoting his
debut album to be released this
summer.

The video was supervised by
Bob Finkel, a prominent Holly-
wood producer and fellow CMU
alumnus. Finkel and Gee are cur-
rently under contract with NBC
to develop a situation comedy
based on a big band trying to
make it in the '80s.

Major interest in his orchestra
would seem to indicate a gener-
al resurgence in the popularity of
the big band, but Gee empha-
sizes that appearances can be de-
ceiving; it is his band that has a
particular appeal.

”Everyone’s in that Lawrence
Welk/Guy Lombardo mode.
That's not a true representation of

AAAaaaa."'
o

the big-band sound. The au-
diences need a band that can
properly present the music,” he
said.

The presentation of the music
has to appeal to a wide range of
listeners, which poses a problem
for a style of music that reached
its original peak of popularity
over 40 years ago. Gee recog-
nizes these obstacles but attempts
to conquer the generation gap
with boundless enthusiasm.

’’I know we're all misplaced in
time. I personally think i live in
1943 instead of 1987. I'm roman-
tic and old-fashioned, and I love
jazz and big band. But the video
offers a better idea of what we're
all about — not just a group of
musicians but individual charac-
ters who enjoy each other’s
company.”

Gee’s current band, which in-
cludes some of the finest jazz mu-

sicians in Pittsgburgh, has been
together for almost four‘ years.
“But then, Pittsburgh is notorious
as a jazz breeding ground,” he
added. ”Billy Eckstine, George
Benson —- a lot of stars have
direct or indirect ties to this
town.”

Though he has the ambition to
become one of those big stars,
Gee warns against ”bastardiza-
tion” of the big-band sound. ”l
want to do a pop presentation
with the big-band sound on the
Grammys, but I'd also like to be
recognized in the jazz com-
munity.

”People might scoff at these
goals, but 10 years ago, in high
school, no one believed l’d ful-
fill my dream of starting a big
band. Count Basie once told me
that these’s no magic formula for

Eurythmics turn to savagery

Eurythmics
Savage
RCA

One of my favorite new groups
of the 1982 British synth invasion
was the Eurythmics because of
their haunting Sweet Dreams
(Are Made of This) album. I be-
came an instant fan. What im-
pressed me so much was that
they were using synthesizers to
accent well-written songs and not
letting the synths use them to
produce mindless dance drivel.

Their next two albums, Touch
and the ill-fated soundtrack to the
movie 1984 (for the Love of Big
Brother) were equally daring and
interesting. These past successes
seemed to promise that Be Your-
self Tonight would surpass any of
their other albums. It did, but in
sales only.

Be Yourself Tonight and
Revenge were well-calculated
and boring examples of how a
band can be trapped by a formu-
la. Out of both albums, only
”WouId I Lie to You” sounds like
it has any life. Dave Stewart and

Annie Lennox had come up with
a slick sound to cover their stag-
nant ideas.

I was cautious when I heard the
first single from the Eurythmics
new album Savage. Sure,
”Beethoven (I Love to Listen to)”
is weird, but what does the rest
of the album sound like? Lucki-
ly, Savage is the Eurythmics great
return to music. I knew it would
be good when Pete Bishop of the
The Pittsburgh Press said it was
trite, experimental and too artsy
for their own good.

Savage is 47 minutes of solid
Eurythmics picking up where
7984 left off. Annie's lyrics are
seemingly an artistic attack at her
vegetarian guru ex-husband. In
the acoustic ”I Need You” she
spits:

I need you to pin me down so
I can live in torment

With the release of Lennox’s
frustration comes a release of the
creativity that Eurythmics effec-

tively sheilded on their last two‘

”efforts.” The sparse music pro-
vides the perfect atmosphere for
Annie's lush multitracked vocals.

She is at her vocal peak on this
album . Her range extends from
the angelically enticing ”You’ve
Placed a Chill in My Heart” and
the dissonant ”Beethoven” to the
uninhibited belt of ’’I Need a
Man.”

Musically, Savage is filled with
catchy hooks, weird sounds and
irresistable melodies. David
Stewart and Annie Lennox are
back to performing as a duo.
Amazingly enough, their perfor-
mances far exceed any of those
on Be Yourself Tonight or
Revenge, where they used a full
band to accentuate their sound.

In a musical age in which an al-
bum usually has one or two good
songs, Savage is a tour de force.
Out of the albums’ 12 songs, only
two sound underdeveloped. For
a group that almost sold out com-
pletely to the mainstream on their
last two albums, Savage comes as
as unexpected surprise. It is a tri-
umphant and welcome return of
the Eurythmics to creative and in-
triguing music.

For The Pitt News

I wanted my first newspaper
review of a theater production
to be a good experience. I
wanted to be able to go to the
Pittsburgh Playhouse produc-
tions of You Can't Take It With
You and come back and write
things like: The set was beau-
tiful, the staging and script
clever, the acting true to the
moment.

However, this was not the
case. Yes, the staging was
balanced and picturesque. The
dancer's movement was used
to offset larger groups of peo-
ple and the focus of the action
on the other side of the stage.

The script, though dated
lI930’s pro-socialist), was
delightfully funny. Unfor-
tunately, the problem was at
the heart of the production —
the acting.

This play was supposed to
affirm understanding and em-
pathy in human as well as
familial relationships. But, the
actors often didn't play the
relationships that the script
was trying to affirm.

This was the greatest
problem in the play because it
was even missing from the
relationship between the male
and female leads. Tony and
Alice were supposed to be in
love with each other but ap-

You just can't
take it to heart

peared to fall into each others’
arms accidentally.

Alice seemed sure from the
beginning that her allegiance
was first to her family. She
does not appear to need to
convince herself of that even
when the man she loves is in
the same room proposing to
her.

The only relationships the
actors actually played and de-
veloped on stage were those
of the mother, Penelope, with
her daughter Alice. Penelope
really seemed to care about
her daughter, especially when
Alice had broken her engage-
ment and was leaving for the
mountains while Mr. Kirby
seemed genuinely offended by
his wife's free associations.

These were the good mo-
ments, but the scarcity of these
moments abounded, robbing
the production of its life. Much
of the movement seemed un-
motivated except by the re-
quirement of balancing the
composition on stage. Many
times the humor simply did
not play; the appropriate tim-
ing and genuineness just were
not there. ,

The beauty of the set and the
compositions as well as the
delightful script could not car-
ry a production in which the
actors did not develop and
play the tensions in their rela-
tionships.

Television game sh

By David Ballarotto

I Staff Writer

CBS apparently has high hopes
for its new daytime game show
Blackout. This new show, hosted
by Bob Goen, is replacing one of
TV’ history's most venerable
games —— The $25,000 Pyramid.

As game shows go, this one

‘isn't half bad. The idea is for one

member of a contestant-celebrity
learn to record a description of a
~»(‘( ret word that somehow fits
into a computer—generated puzzle
phrase. However, one. member of
the opposing team has seven sec-
onds during which he can selec-
tively ”black out” part of the

-tlescri ption.

Once. a contestant has solved
two puzzles, he has 70 seconds
to play the bonus game. Here,
there is a series of words he must
watch come over a video screen.
When he thinks his celebrity part-
ner can solve it, he yells ”Solve
it!” If the celebrity does not guess
the word, the team has to make
up for the word and solve
another. "

OK, so it's not exactly Master-
piece Theatre, but it's good
enough for 10 a.m. in the morn-
ing. Topping it off is the host. He
is not obnoxious (the hilarious
Gene Rayburn), bland (Pat Sajak),
nor is he trying to be a comedian

(everyone else except Bob
Barker).

However, one of its fine points
is its set. Unlike most game
shows of the '80s (a good exam-
ple is /eopardyl), its set does not
look like it just miraculously
sprung up out of one of those stu-
dios at CBS Television City. It
looks like it was constructed to
please the eye, rather than to
please some set designer's ego.

All in all, it’s not that bad a
show. Nothing worth skipping
class for, but not half bad.

Grade: B

One of the hot trends in TV has
been the revival of old game
shows with slight modification
from the original show. Often,
the title will have a slight change
in it as well. -

For example, one of the longest
running game shows on televi-
sion (the second longest after The
Price is Right.) is Concentration.
Last May, it returned to NBC day-
time as Classic Concentration.

Although this new Concentra-
tion is just about as good as the
one most of us grew up either
watchingor playing, that exciting
Milton Bradley home version, not
many of the retreads are worth
making a special effort to catch.

Among the better shows are

ows —just for the fun of it

Pyramid, Card Sharks, and The
New Newlywed Game. Each of
these manages to capture the ap-
peal of their namesake. Alex Tre-
bek is not Art Fleming, but
today's Jeopardy! has the same
erudite appeal as the original.

But a good example of a flaw-
filled rehash is the new Holly-
wood Squares. Although John
Davidson’s hosting abilities are
similar to Peter Marshall's on the
original, the stars on the new one
just aren’t like those on the old
one.

The old Squares had a hilarious
set of stars on the board: the late
Paul Lynde, the great George
Gobel, the witty Rose Marie. To-
day's show does have Joan
Rivers, but her talents are being
forced to share the same studio
as the unfunny JM J. Bullock (an
interesting spelling of ”Jim”),
Shadoe Stevens and guest stars
sharing the magnitude of the
great Audrey Landers or the in-
imitable Joe Carcione. '

Unfortunately, a lot of these re-
hashes sound good on paper, and

somehow they always manage to

get airtime. However, as Sade, s

that wise sage, once said, ”It’s
never as good as the first time.”

Grade : A for effort. D for result.

Also worth pointing out is that
one game show has the notorie-
ty of never seeming to be the
same as it used to be. Sale ofthe
Century has changed its format
once more.

I've seen A.T.S. a couple of times over
the past two weeks. WOW! They are real-
ly good. They must have gotten anxious,
waiting for their bass player to come back
from an extended trip to Finland. The
energy they built up has been coming out
in terrifically tight spurts. See ’em 

New records you should hear: 63 Eyes,
Look In For Mothmen. Post, post—punk
from our neighbors in Parkersburg, W.Va.
Especially hot are ”A Hell that Looks Like
an Open-Pit Mine” and ”Cavewoman
with Dishpan Hands.” -

The new flREHOSE record lf’n is cer-
tainly less bombastic than their first one,
Ragin’ Full On. Mike Watt pegs Michael

&

Stipe perfectly in ”For the Singervof S

REM.” And Phranc, the most famous of
Jewish lesbian folksingers, assists Ed

The Lola Fee

"fromohio” Crawford on another stan-
dout, ”In Memory of Elizabeth Cotton.”
 Echo and the Bunnymen do some fine
live covers on the flipside of their new
”Bedbugs and Ballyhoo” 12-inch. Includ-
ed are The Velvet Underground's ”Run,
Run, Run”; the Stone's ”Paint It Black”
and Televisions’ ”Friction.” Surprisingly
hot.

Double Veteran from Animal Time
should be on your Valentine's Day gift
list. Georgia rock ‘n’ roll that really rips-
it-apart!  Live music you should miss
only if you are suddenly dismembered by

falling space debris. Crowflies, Bbronk,

and th Pleasure Heads. We all know how
I feel about the Crow Flies! A very in-
teresting Bbronk reunion (minus two key
members, Hmmm ...) and the debut of the

Na

Peel Session  A

first all—girl band Pittsburgh has seen in a
long time, The Pleasure Heads. New
blood is always good. They all play on
Saturday, Feb. 6 at the Squirrel Hill
American Legion  A.T.S., tighter than
ever, is at The Decade on Sunday, Feb.
5 .

Look for Camper Van Beethoven on
Virgin Records real soon  Did you
mourn the ninth anniversary of the tragic
passing of Sid Vicious? On Feb. 2, 1979,
society claimed one of the most influen-
tial icons of the popular underground.
Bow your head in silence for just a brief
moment  In conclusion, this week in
1949, RCA Victor introduced the 45 rpm
record. It was designed as a rival to
Columbia’s 33 ‘/3 rpm introduced the year
before. Now you know who to blame.

like puzzle board, now contes-
tants are playing the game for a
chance to win a prize and are
given a chance to win money in
a new ”Winner’s Game.”

The new game has the winning
contestant choose among three
puzzle packs to solve five word
puzzles of six words. The contes-
tant has 25 seconds to do this,
and the words come on at the
rate of about one per second.
Therefore, the ' player should
guess fast.

The puzzles usually aren't that
hard either. For example,
TV/Dad/of/Rudy/andflheo is ob-
viously Bill Cosby.

The first chance at the game is
worth $5,000 and increases by
$1,000 each time the champion
wins. When the player has
played for $10,000, he tries for a
car and then for $50,000.

All in all, it's interesting, but it's
also one of many changes the

‘ program has made since debut-

ing on NBC in the early '80s.
Originally, contestants would try
to accumulate money to buy lux-
urious merchandise at bargain
prices.
For example, an expensive car
could be bought for $575.
Then the show decided to have
the ”Winner’s Board” where the
winner tries to match prizes.
The end game is not the only
thing that has changed either. The
”Fame Game” used to have nine
stars, and the contestant who got
the question right could pick one
to see what was behind it. Then
the stars were replaced by num-
bers. Then they decided to have
the board have flashing lights
which were stopped by having
the contestant hit his buzzer.

However, there is one wel-
come change on daytime game
shows.

Bob Barker has decided to pa-
rade the Price is Right stage with
his hair naturally gray.

In a society obsessed with
youth and adolescence, it's
refreshing to see somebody look
his real age.

Here's hoping Dick Clark will
follow.

If you're wondering why you
didn't see a silver-haired Barker
during Christmas break it's be-
cause those episodes were
reruns.

music by David Shire and lyrics
by Richard Maltby Jr.

The musical, orginally per-
formed at Broadway’s Barrymore
Theatre in 1983, focuses on three
couples who, at various stages of
their lives, are contemplating
parenthood.

New to the university, and
making their Pitt Theatre debut,
are Jane Gentry and Michael Soli,
who portray the youngest expec-
tant couple.

Gentry has a bachelor’s degree
in musical theater from Kent State
University and is a first—year
master's acting candidate at Pitt.
Whileat Kent State, she appeared
as Titania in A Midsummer
Night’s Dream, Babe in A Cho-
rus Line, Rose in The Wool-
gatherers and Ingrid in Peer Gynt.

Soli, a musician, composer and
freshman pre—law major at Pitt,
has recorded several of his songs
and won a battle-of-the—band con-
test on WJET-FM in his
hometown of Erie, Pa. He has ap-
peared as the Gentleman Caller

tfretlits aside, Soli didn't mxgiect
to get the part. "i wanted to see

what a college audition was like.
ldidn’t think I'd get in the show,
and I thought l’d }LiST work behind
the scenes."

Gentry, on the other hand, -was
afraid she'd get her part for the
wrong reasons. ”At first, I
thought, ’They’re going to cast
me because I'm an MFA.’ I was
worried that I would get preferen-
tial treatment, but that’s not how
it is.”

And now that they have the
parts, there’s not a moment's rest.
Not only are Gentry and Soli
busy with rehearsals, which be-
gan in December, but also with
other job responsibilities. Gentry
teaches and works in Pitt's
costume shop, and Soli handles

the ”Calendar of Events” for the ‘

University Times newspaper.

The show, which will be staged
in Pitt's intimate Studio Theatre
located in the Cathedral of Learn-
ing basement, is also the first full-
scale production that master's
directing candidate David Weid-
man has directed.

success —— just perseverance. I'm
fortunate enough to live that
dream as a successful leader of a
band I’m proud of.” .

Gee has special praise for the
band's two singers. The sweet
voice of Sandra Dowe, a recent
Duquesne graduate, is beautiful-
ly complemented by the talents
of Shorts Davis, a jazz veteran
who toured with the orchestras of
Count Basie and Tommy Dorsey.

Davis is an exceptional dancer
as well, performing a tap routine
that should baffle shufflers half
his age. ”He taught Gregory
Hines how to dance,” beamed
Gee. Davis should definitely add
inspiration to the dance instruc-
tion, which will provide a short
lesson before the ballroom begins
to swing.

However, there’s no need for
Astaire-like expertise in order to
enjoy the big band. ’’I love to say

Baby

Continued from page 13

Gentry said working in the
small space is more of a
challenge because ”it’s like being
at dinner with your audience.
You want to look at the audience
to see their reaction, and you
can’t.”

Another interesting first for this
production will come on Feb. 4
at the last dress rehearsal. Expec-
tant parents and childbirth class
instructors from seven area hospi-
tals and health agencies have
been invited to attend. Prizes, do-
nated by local retailers and hospi-
tals, will be distributed through
drawings at intermission to the
parents-to-be in the audience.

Gentry, who has never been
pregnant, is a little nervous about
this final rehearsal. ”l’m terrified.
I'm not too worried about the

fathers because they don't know
what's going on, but the mothers
have one up on me because they
know.”

It sounds like everyone is hav-
ing fun with this production. Soli
expressed his feelings: ’’I just love
the show. It has a universal theme
to it. I couldn't ask for nicer peo-
ple or show or department.”

If you've had difficulty getting
tickets for Studio Theatre produc-
tions in the past, you may find
them easier to obtain for Baby.
Tuesday nights and an extra week
of performances have been ad-
ded making the new run dates
Feb. 5 through 28.

So, if you've never been to a
Studio Theatre production before,
why not make the Pittsburgh
premiere of Baby a first for you
too?

Wrestling team preparing for Bloomsburg

By Vince Carey

Assistant Sports Editor

There is an upcoming battle of
Top 20 teams at Fitzgerald Field
House.

The 18th—ranked (National
Wrestling Coaches Association)
Pitt Panthers take on the No. 14
Huskies of Bloomsburg Friday
night in what looks on paper to
be one of the most exciting

wrestling matches to hit these

parts this year.
This is not the biggest news,
though.

Panther All-America Pat San-
toro came away with the cham-
pionship at Tuesday's All—Star
Classic. Santoro is currently
ranked No. 1 in the nation at 142
pounds

Edinboro’s Sean O’Day was
the latest victim of the Santoro
Splash, losing 16-10. O’Day went
into the match ranked No. 2 at
142 pounds.

From those who saw the
match, it was described as atypi-
cal Santoro match. He dominat-
ed from the beginning and never
let O’Day get into his groove.

The attention now shifts back
to the upcoming Bloomsburg
meet.

”We expect a very close one,”
Bloomsburg coach Roger Sanders
said. ”It should be very competi-
tive at most weights."

The Pitt coaches see it shaping
up the same way.

”They certainly have a good,
solid Iineup,” Pitt assistant coach
Stan Mousetis said. ’’It’s hard to
say who will win this one.”

The biggest match may be at
150 pounds. Pitt's Scott Hovan is

-Team effort

slated to take on Bloomsburg’s
Dave Morgan.

‘'1 think this should be a pretty
tough match," Hovan said. ”I
hope that I can do well. Being in
my position, I really have noth-
ing to lose against a guy like him.
For us to win, we are going to
have to pull off a couple of
upsets.”

This is a hard one to pin down.
Pitt boasts a solid lineup an-
chored by Santoro, while the
Huskies key is with Morgan.

‘'1 think that we can take either
142 or 150,” Sanders said. ”That

is wherever Santoro doesn’t show
up. Other than that, it is up in the
air.”

”Bloomsburg has been shuf-
fling their Iineup around for
awhile," Panther assistant coach
John Hartupee said. ”We have to
be ready; there is no doubt about
that. But it's hard to say what will
happen until it does.”

The first match is slated to be-
gin at 7:30 p.m. Although there
is no championship at stake,
there may be more excitement
than the Hulk and Andre can
muster up.

Seven double-figure scorers lead Pitt past Redmen

Sports Editor

JAMAICA, NY — Before last
night's game against St. John’s,
the Panthers were 0-5 in Alumni
Hall. But Pitt wasn't concerned
with any losing streaks, for some-
thing more important was at
stake. First-place in the Big East
Conference.

The Panthers knew it. St. John’s
knew it. The only difference was
Pitt did something about it,
defeating the Redmen 88-71 in
front of a sell-out crowd of 6,008.

”This is the time of year you
want things to come together,”
Pitt point guard Sean Miller said.
”We’ve won all our home
games, which is what you want
to do. We have to knock off a few
other teams on the road.”

The Panthers [ranked ninth by
The Associated Press] improved
their record to 16-2 overall and
6-1 in the league. St. John’s
[ranked 20th by AP] fell to 14-4
and 5-3.

”I don't think we missed that
many shots,” said Pitt freshman
Jason Matthews, who added, ”I
knew our big guys could beat
their big guys down the floor.”

Pitt shot 58.3 percent (35-60)
from the field and (14-16) 87 per-
cent from the foul line.

St. John’s took control early in
the game, running up a 9-2 lead
by mixing up the scoring. Shelton
Jones, Greg Harvey and Jayson
Williams each hit jumpers during
the run.

The Panthers retaliated with a
10-2 run, highlighted by Charles
Smith's consecutive buckets and
a 3-pointer by Sean Miller, giving
Pitt a 12-11 lead.

The lead changed hands eight
more times in the half.

With St. John’s leading 27-25
following Harvey's 3-point shot,
Pitt went on another run. The
Panthers scored seven straight
points on Miller's second
3-pointer, a Jerome Lane jumper,
and two free throws by Bobby
Martin. That gave Pitt a 32-27
lead.

Miller was pleased his three-
point shooting came back to
form. ”It felt great, the greatest
I've felt in two weeks," he said.
”I needed to bust a couple to get
me feeling good."

Pitt led at halftime 45-38.

The Panthers took matters into
their own hands early in the se-
cond half. 2

After the Redmen scored two
quick baskets, their offense went
to sleep. St. John’s managed only
eight points in the next seven
minutes as the Panthers went on
a 19-8 scoring binge, increasing
thei_r lead to 66-50.

Demetreus Gore scored nine of
his game-high '19 points“during
that stretch.

But St. John’s refused to give in.
Pitt led 70-53 at the 10:17 mark
when St. John’s made its last run
of the game. The Redmen scored
11 of the game's next 13 points,
narrowing the margin to 72-64 at
6:32. .

Pitt's Darelle Porter countered
with four points to quiet the
crowd. After Williams hit a free
throw and Matt Brust scored on
a layup, Matthews hit two straight
baskets, giving Pitt an 80-67
edge.

St. John’s could get no closer
than 11 points the rest of the way.

In an unusual occurence, all 12
players who scored in the game
were in double figures.

Pitt placed seven players in
double figures. Following“Gore’s_
19 points, Smith scored 18
points, Matthews had 11 and
Lane, Miller, Martin, and Porter
each chipped in with 10.

The Redmen were led by
Michael Porter’s 18 points. Jones
added 17, while Harvey had 14,
Williams had 12 and Brust scored
10.

Lane led all rebounders with
10 .

The key down the stretch for
the Panthers was Porter and Mat-
thews. Both scored on pivotal
possessions which took away
some of the Redmen’s
momentum.

”[The win] felt good for Darelle
and me. We tried to get on the
break. If we had the layup, we
took it," said Matthews.

"Me and Jason play real well
together. If he doesn't do some-
thing, then I come in and do it,”
Porter said. ”We both came in
and had a good game together."

PANTHER NOTES: Pitt's next
game is Feb. 10 against Syracuse
at the Civic Arena.

Lady Panthers peak
at right time, ready
for rest of season

By Matt Martin

Assistant Sports Editor

If the recent play of the Pitt
Lady Panther basketball team is
any indication of what lies ahead,
the rest of the Big East teams bet-
ter be prepared for some all-out
wars.

The Lady Panthers, riding a
two-game winning streak and 4-1
in their last five games, seem to
be peaking at just the right time.

After losing seven consecutive
games, six in the Big East, Pitt has
won two out of three league
games and now stands at 2-7 in
the conference, 10-10 overall.

”I think we are [peaking at the
right time], I really do,” said Lady
Panther head coach Kirk Bruce.
”IfI had a crystal, I hope I would
see us going undefeated (in the
last seven games, all Big East con-
tests). We’re gonna go after it.”

If the consistent play of Bruce’s

seventh leading scorer in Pitt
history.

Junior forward Deidra Baker,
an All-American at Hilbert Junior
College in Hamburg, N.Y., last
year averages 9.4 ppg and leads
Pitt with 33 steals.

In the seven remaining games,
the Lady Panthers will be facing
league competition for the sec-
ond time around. ”I think I know
how to beat each of these teams,
and I think the girls know how to
beat each of these teams,” Bruce
said. '

However, the Lady Panthers
will have stiff competition as
each team they will face has al-

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, February 4, 1988

PITTSBURGH (AP) — The
Pittsburgh-based WPIAL, which
fought last weekend's approval of
Pennsylvania high school football
playoffs, now is concerned its
Quad-A champion may not
qualify.

Because the Western Pennsyl-
vania Interscholastic Athletic
League will not realign to accom-

odate the state playoffs, 20

PIAL Class AAA teams will be
classified Quad-A by the PIAA.

If the WPlAL’s Quad-A cham-
pion has a record such as 9-4 and
an AAA team is 12-0 or 13-0
without playing any of the top
4-A teams, the Triple-A team may
advance to the big-school
playoffs if it has a higher PIAA rat-
ing. The P|AA’s playoff teams will
be determined by a rating system
that awards a team points for
each defeated opponent.

GREEN BAY, Wis. —- Lindy.|n-
fante, the offensive coordinator
who helped the Cleveland
Browns to consecutive appear-
ances in the AFC championship
game, took over Wednesday as
head coach of the Green Bay
Packers.

’’I didn't take this job to be here
two or three years and be a
loser,’' Infante told a news con-
ference. ‘

Infante, 47, signed a five-year
contract, the details of which
were not released.

Tom Braatz, Packers executive
vice president of football opera-
tions, said lnfante’s expertise on
offense is what made him at-
tractive.

Many coaches are glad Penn-
sylvania, traditionally one of na-
tion's top prep football states, will
no longer be one of only seven
states without playoffs.

Others are pleased the playoffs
were approved last weekend
despite the vocal opposition of
the WPIAL, which has been con-
ducting its own highly profitable
playoffs for years.

”We started talking about this
12 years ago, it seems like an
eternity,” said District 3 chairman
Ed Brunner. ”Now that it is a real-
ity, it's very exciting.”

”lts time has come,” said
Robert Buckanavage, the state
athletic directors’ representative
to the PIAA Board of Control. ’’In
all fairness to athletes in Pennsyl-
vania, they should be given the
opportunity for a state champion-
ship. The PIAA has state champi-

”Over the last four or five years
 he's been highly regarded as
one of the best offensive coordi-
nators in the NFL,” Braatz said.

Infante said he would call the
plays next season, and did not ex-
pect to name an offensive coor-
dinator.

Green Bay struggled on offense
last season when it finished 5-9-1,
but Infante said that didn't worry
him.

’’we’ll be as multiple an

offense as the players allow us to A

be once we get a system in-
stalled," he said. ’’I believe a
wide variety of things on offense
will get the jolnione.”

Infante was the Packers’ second
choice to replace Forrest Gregg,
who resigned last month after
four years to become head coach
at Southern Methodist University.

”We in the WPIAL have had
district playoffs for years without
any help from the PIAA. We have
always been left on our own,” Ar-
butina said. ”Now the PIAA
wants to change something that
has been going on for years. We
will still hold our playoffs.”

The WPIAL playoffs won't af-
fect the PIAA championships,
since they won't start until all dis-
trict playoffs are completed.
Some WPIAL administrators com-
plained the state playoffs will ex-
tend an already too-long season.

Four teams —— two from the east
and two from the west —- will
qualify for the playoffs in each of
the PlAA’s four classes: A, AA,
AAA and Quad-A. The playoffs
begin this December.

‘Infante takes Packer job

Michigan State Coach George
Perles last week turned down a
reported five—year contract worth
$2.25 million. 7

Before he joined the Browns in
February of 1986, Infante was
head coach of the Jacksonville
Bulls of the United States Football

League in 1984 and 1985. Her

compiled a record of 15-21.
Infante was named the Cincin-
nati Bengals’ offensive coordina-
tor in 1982 and for two years
before that was the team's quar-
terbacks and receivers coach.
The Packers have had only four
winning seasons since they won
two straight Super Bowl champi-
onships in 1967 and 1968. There
have been four coaches since
Vince Lombardi resigned in
1968, and none have brought the
Packers to a championship game.

Continued from page 16

Pitt beat the Pirates 85-79 for
their first conference win this
yeah

But even if Pitt should go 0-7,
they should definitely challenge
each of these teams. And when
the Big East Tournament rolls
around, the Lady Panthers should
be ready for any squad they face.’

The Championship Tourna-
ment will be held at Fitzgerald
Field House March 3 through 6
this year. It is the first time Pitts-
burgh has hosted the event. The
winner receives an automatic bid
to the NCAA Tournament.

But Pitt still has a chance to
challenge for the regular season
title if they play well in the last
leg of the 1987-88 season and are
aided by losses to league-leaders

Syracuse and Villanova.

We've gotta play our game,”
Bruce said. ”We have to beat the
teams that are ahead of us, like
Georgetown, Seton Hall and
Connecticut."

"We can't worry aliout Wl1r)'s
heating who when V./1' rr- :2 tlw
middle of a }.’,dITtt‘. \\’ti'vi.- _«.:otm
play our game, and afterwards,
we can look in the paper and see
who helped us,” Bruce con-
tinued.

The Lady Panthers will get their
first chance to continue their late-
season winning streak when they
face Boston College at Fitzgerald
Field House at 3 p.m. Saturday.

The Eagles are 5-4 in the
league, 10-8 overall, and beat Pitt
70-44 on Jan. 7 in the Lady Pan-
ther’s worst shooting perfor-
mance of the year.
