ﬂedgling Owl In A Flurry

 

Annual Flight Of Fowl

 

Busy days have fallen upon
the Owl staff. Letters pour in
from the printer, the engraver,
the photographer, the cover
con-rpan . Queries from stu-
dents, “When will the Owl ap-
pear on campus?” harass the
overworked editor. Life has be-
come a round of W0I'k- The
snapshots simply must 8'0 05 10-
(lay and those two pages of
write-ups can’t be held over any
longer.”

Monday, Tuesday, Wednes-
day, Thursday, Friday and Sat-
urday—-Sunday is the only day
of rest. Oﬁice hours mean nary
a thing. It's a matter of snip-
ping, pasting and typing-then
subjection to approval--and fi-
nally oﬂ to the post-oﬁice.

It surely will be one grand
Owl if the staff doesn’t weaken.

Panther Goes Feminine

 

Cover For Last Issue Drawn
By New York Artist

 

June number, Pitt Panther will pre-
sent a smart, altogether chic, maga-
Zllle.

Forsaking the conventional funny
cartoon covers, the Panther will
startle the campus with a “girl? cov-
er. The cover will be graced by _a
beautiful henna haired beauty. The
painting was done by‘ a New_.'York
artist. ' ’

Panther feature writers before
setting off for the wilds with ﬁshing
tackle or glns, have contributed fea-
tures decidedly above-par. “The-
ater,” by Marvin T. Herrick; “Catch-
ing Everything,” by Eddie Hirsh-
berg; “Eavesdropping On Sports,”
by Morris Cohen; “Dressing Up,”’by
Charles Goldstein, ‘and others make
their farewell until September. In
addition there will be a short story
the writer of which, thus far, has re-
imained anonymous. «

Dean Clothier Addresses
Y.W.C.A. Luncheon Meeting

Due to the inability of Mir. Rob-
ert C. Cil-othier, dean of men, to
speak to the members of  W. C. A.
at the Monday noon meeting, May 4,
Mr. W. W. Mendrenhall, secretary of
the Pitt Y. M. C. A., spoke to the
women on the question of “How
Public Opinion I-s Formed.”

Mr.’ Memdenhall emphasized the
fact that average opinions are nega-
tive and stereotyped in form, draw-
ing an example from the w-ay most
people select their religious prefer-
ence. “Instead of examining the va-
rious religions, and studying their
adaptability to it, most persons ac-
cept the faith of their parents with-
out ques_ti~on,” he stated.

Dean Clothier will "speak Monday,
May 11, on the question of “The
Place of Religion on the Campus.”
The annual installation of oﬂicers
for the Y. W. C. A. will take place
Monday, May"18. The following of-

-ﬁcers will be installed: president,

cool, slow-burning quality of this
favorite smoking tobacco.

It's the same story everywhere-

DRIVE CLOSED

C r a d u-at i on Announcement
Orders Placed With Com-
mittees; Record Made

 

The campaign for June, 1931,
graduation announcemeils came to
a close last ’I‘u_e_sday, with seniors
from all schools placing their orders
with the committee.

More orders than -have ever been
placed before were made this ear,
according to report by I. M. rei-
mer, Dent. '31, chairman.

The drive has been carried on for
the last month at tables in State
and Alumni halls, and in Walter
_Rome’s office in the Activities build-
ing. . .
This year's announcements carry
heretofore unpublished views of the
Cathedral and are greatly distin-
guished by a new process of en-
graving. The design for the leath-
er booklets features the Cathedral
on a background of blue grooved
leather. The design was repeated
on the cardboard booklets which
were also available to the students. A

The Charles H. Elliot Company,
Philadelphia, largest college engrav-
ing house in the world, was granted
the contract by the committee, which
is as follows: I. M. Kreimer, Dent.,
chairman; Betty Knapp -and Ben
Sufrine, Col.; Russel Braund, Bus.
Ad.; Franklin Felker, Eng.; Berna-
dette Connolly, Ed.; J. F. McDon-

Ed. '31; Elinor Smith, Ed. ’33; Mary
Dyke_, Ed. ’34, and Mrs. Tracy, phys-

a double play in which Martha
Wfathe. Ed. ’34, was put out at the
‘home plate by Virginia Negley, Ed.
34, who then threw to ﬁrst base
lgéocking out Gretchen Brooks, Ed.

 

At present baseball is the most

riding has only a few less followers.
When the tennis tournament opens
next week, it is quite possible that
the tennis fans will outnumber those
coming out for baseball.

Anyone interested in any of the
spring sports who has not yet come
out, may sign up at the Gym. Those
who have already signed up are
asked by the managers to watch the
bulletin boards for news of their fa-

Those who attended the Annual

stimulating concert. If it had een
perfect, one would have felt that
these young singers could not pos-
sibly be students. As it was, the
poor spots served only to emphasize
those which showed good voices and
intelligent direction under Mrs. Rob-
ert Ayars. -

Those of us who were skeptical
of the real musical value of any
women's chorus (most of them are
so stu id) received a pleasant shock.
Mrs. s in her first year at Pitt
has we ded so many untamed and

‘untried young voices into a respon-

sive instrument.
Julia Jarvaise, who has been in
this country only one year, sang two

numbers from her ‘native Turkey v ~

“Seragli Odalisque” and “Dolma'
both of which have been arranged
by occidental musicians to" suit our
scale system. Even then, they struck-
a note that was strange but pleas-
ing to an ear used to our familiar
do-re-mi.

world materializes.

The octette in, bright Polish cos; ,

tumes brought some of the. sunshine

of Slavoc people to our Anglo-Saxon -
Pittsburgh. They were pleasant to '

the ear and charming to the eye.

also played accompaniments to sev-

eral of ‘the chorus pieces, was the

really unusual event of the evening.

Talk To Coed Juniors

Mrs. L; H. Cretcher, author of “An

afternoon at the annual tea ten-
dered by the "women of the Junior
class to those of the Senior class at
Heinz House. '

Mrs. Cretcher told of the first ‘de-
tective story ever written, that of
Solomon proposing to divide the baby
between the two contesting women.
Soloman as the original Sherlock
Holmes, Philo Vance or what you
will, used psychological means to
discover the real mother.

 

“Detective tales might be divided

into two classiﬁcations,” Mrs. Cret-
cher said, “those which are intellec-
tual and those which are sensation-
al. The perfect yarn is somewhat
between the two,--it should be in-
tellectual enough to explain all oc-
currences and sensational enough to
hold the reader's interest."

IN THE MAD rush of these ﬁnal
days it doesn't take long to slip
down to Kookley’s Tearoom on
Forbes near Oakland street and get
a cool sandwich and a cooler drink
of milk to tide you over the hectic
days of aﬁairs, teas, exams, etc. And
the eﬁicient service is exactly what
busy students like when they're in
a hurry.

LETTER WRITING is the only
way lots of University students can
keep in touch with one another in
the summertime; and what could be
nicer than a letter-case from the
Techbound Studio on Bouquet street
to remind the girl you took to all
the dances this year that a letter
would be greeted with joy. At the
Studio you will ﬁnd writing cases in
all shades and kinds of leather.

(0‘¢

George Lott, third ranking player
last year; and Johnny Doeg, who
was ranked ﬁrst last year, has not
been playing much this year, the
burden of supporting a wife requir-
ing all his time.

Eddie Jacobs has never fulﬁlled
the promise which he showed during
his career as a junior player wh-en
he and Frank Shields led the parade
continually. This year his form has
improved, and if he is fortunate in
escaping the injuries which dogged

‘him last year, he should go a little

farther than his present standing in-

dicates.
* * Ill

EDDIE HAS ALWAYS had the
Indian sign on Johnny Doeg, who, as
mentioned above, was ranked ﬁrst
nationally last year. In 1929, when
Eddie was a sophomore at Pitt, he
met Doeg twice and beat him both
times in two straight sets.

One of these matches occurred in
the intercollegiate championships in
the second round. Eddie reached the
semi-ﬁnal round of the tournament
that year and was ranked fourth
among the collegiate players. John-
ny was ranked tenth.

Later in that same year, both boys
entered the national championships.
Johnny, fortunately, was seeded in a
bracket other than that in which
Eddie, was competing. Eddie was
eliminated in one of the early
rounds, but Johnny won his way to
semi-ﬁnals. Johnny was ranked
third nationally that year, while Ed-
die’s name was left off the list.

It ‘seems -strange that a man who
was ranked seven places lower in
one classiﬁcation than an opponent
was placed third nationally while his
rival was not mentioned; but such
was the case.

Inconsistency is the life of sport,
but such inconsistency as mentioned
above calls for some explanation
which we feel is impossible to give.
But. Eddie can probably avert a rep-
e[t1t1_on of such occurrences by con-
tinuing the great form which he has
shown to date.

Utterback Sets New
Jump Record

At the Ohio Relays last week the
Pitt team entered in three events
was‘ able to place in two of them. Ut-
terback,’ in winning the broad jump,
set a new record for that event; and
Kopnicki, competing for the first
time in high-class competition, was
third in the javelin throw.

Utterback succeeded in getting
into last year’s form when he broke
the Ohio Relays record for the broad
jump with a jump of twenty-four
feet. The previous record of 23 feet
and 7 and 7-8 inches was set by
Portmess of Northwestern last year.
It seems queer that the week before
the Ohio Relays, Utterback compet-
ed in the Penn Relays and was un-
able to even place in the broad jump
at Philadelphia. Then last week he
went to Columbus and was able to
set a new record. Queer guys these
athletes.

Kopnicki, the man who came
through, was third in the javelin
‘throw. The winning mark of 177
feet was not far from Kopnicki’s
best previous mark.

The mile relay team was unable

FIVE TEAMS
ENGAGED IN
DISPUTES

Protests and counter protests by
the teams ﬁnishing in the leading
positions in the-interfraternity track
meet and sweepstakes have so befud-
dled the committee in charge of the
events that no decision has been
reached as to which teams are de-
servin.g of the championship cups.

S. A. E. was announced as being
the winners of the track meet with
Delta Tau Delta and Theta Delta
Psi ﬁnishing close behind. The lat-
ter, however, protested the ﬁnal
standing due to the fact that one of
their men was not allowed to com-
pete in the broad jump although he
had been entered in the meet.

Their protest was- followed by an-
other advanced by the ‘Delts, one of
whose men was not allowed to com-
pete in the shot put for the same
reason the Theta Delta Psi man was
not permitted to participate in the
broad jump.

The argument started over the
question as to whether or not a
man entered in one event could fore-
go it to compete in another. Gene
Pry, chairman o-f the track meet wht
was in charge of the track events,
permitted entrants in these events to
switch whereas Art George, who was
in charge of the ﬁeld events, would
not permit any man to take part in
an event in which he was not en-
tered.

JUMP CONTESTED

Miller, Theta Delta Psi star whose
mark in the broad jump was not
counted, would have placed second in
that event, as ‘he jumped over 18
feet during the meet while the sec-
ond place winner was not quite able
to touch his mark.

The committee in charge of the
meet‘ decided to count the points
scored in this event for Theta Delta
Psi and also to have_the contestants
in the shot put repeat their perform-
ances and to permit a Delta Tau
Delta man to participate in the
event. The Delts won ﬁrst place in
this event which entitled them to
first place in the meet. A

S. A.’ E. who ‘were announced as
the original winners, protested the
action of the committee. A confer-
ence was held in the office of the
Dean_ of Men Wednesday afternoon
in an attempt to thresh the matter
out, but no decision could be reached.
The committee plans to hold an-
other meeting before deciding the ul-
timate winner of the track meet.

Phi Delta Theta which ﬁnished
second in the sweepstakes behind the
Delts protested the ﬁnal standing
between them on the gro-und that
one of the latter’s men was inelig-
ible. No decision has been reached
on this question either.

What appeared to be aweak. sister in intramural ncompeti-
tion has turned out to be P1tt’s most popular, pastime for non-

varsity men.

After one week in which no games were played, the en-
trants in the Weekly rnushball tournament came through with

a bang.

matches, another game has ended ino

a tin, while the remaining tilt was
played last night. I0
The teams are all set for the sec-
ond round games, all of ’which will
be played next week, and if the
present interest continues, several

. fights and brawls are expected to

enliven the loop.

The best game layed to date was
that between the Ilia pa Nus and the
Phi Gains which en ed in a 1-0 vic-
tory for Fishkin’s team.

.The game‘ was close throughout
the greater part of the battle until
the seventhand last inning when the
Kappa Nus ﬁlled the‘ bases with two
men’ out. The next manpwalked, forc-
ing in the only run of the game.
OMEGA. DELTS WIN
. Omega Del-ta. was the most impres-
sive »winner in the ﬁrst round. They
defeated the Phi Delts, 14-2. Every
man on the winning team with the
exception of Whitaker who played
right” field scored atileast one run.
Art George, who pitched, led the
scorers by crossing the plate three
times. V

The Omega Delts sewed up the
game in the second inning when they
scored four runs. They did not score
again until the sixth innin-g when
they scored two more. The Phi
Delts in the meantime ‘had scored
theirtwo runs.

.. The big blowoff came in the eighth
inning when the Omega Delts more
that batted around to score- eight
runs, Carl Distelhorst, accounting
prof, was the winner’s choice’ ‘for
robber". The other umpire refused to
reveal his name. . -

-The Kappa Sig-s won over Pi
Lambs Wednesday night, 13-8. Hard
hitting and poor ﬁelding featured
the part of the battle.

S. A. E. had an easy time with
the boxing brigade from the Delta
Sig "house in a seven-inning game.
The ﬁnal score was 13-3.

S. A. E. had a 13-0 lead going into

._the last half of the sixth inning

Six winners have been decided in the ﬁrst round

when Dave Rogers, Johnny«Luch,
and Clarence Rodgers, the first three
men to bat for the losers, slugged
out homers for their team’s only
scores of the day. . '

PHI EPS PULL MERRIWELL
Phi Epsilon Pi pulled a combina-
tion Dick Merriwell and Garrison ﬁn-
ish to win over the Delta Tau'Delts,
16-15, after ﬁfteen innings .of‘ hard
play.  * ‘ ' I
The game between" Sigma Alpha

Mu and the .History All-Stars was‘

won by the latter team, 9-8. I
DISPUTED GAME

The Theta Chi-Phi Kappa game
ended in a 3-3 tie. Arguments
arose over whether or not a play-
er shbuld be allowed one baseon
a wild beg over the catcher’sInea.d,
but no protest was registered by
either team. The two teams must

play their game off before midnight .

tonight or be dropped from the tour-
nament.

Sigma Chi and Theta Delta Psi,
two late entrants into the league,
played off their ﬁrst-round game last
night. The winner was not known at
the time when the Weekly went to
press.

The second-round schedule has
been drawn up by the committeein
charge of the event. All these games
must be played by Friday, May 15,
or the teams will be dropped from
the tournament.

W..V| GINIA
MGEIS
lllll

The Pitt Panther tangles with the
Wat Vinginia Wildcat tomorrow in
a dual track and ﬁeld meet on the
Mountaineer ﬁeld gt Morgantown.
Pitt is all set to .0 er a real ﬁght
to the well balanced West Virgum
team and to gain revenge for the
78-28 drubbing handed“ them earlier
in the year in an indoor meet. _ .

P:L1:t’s..cha-nces are not very bright,
and their hopes rest, as they ha“?
all year, in Captain Everett Utter-
back, whose versatihty has for _so
long been the mainstay of the Pitt
track teams. Utterback 1s entered
in the 100-yard dash and the__]umps.
He is expected to have no dlfﬁculty
in taking the broad jump In which
he has been intercollegiate indoor
broad jump champion for two years.
In the high jump, Utterback teams
up with 'Ki.rpatr1ck, who has re-’
turned to track after two months
layoff.

MOUNTAINEERS FAVORITE I

West Virginia should take most
of the points in the track 6V?-‘nits.
particularly in the distances where
the Mountaineers are strong. In the
A. A. U. meet held in Pittsburgh

vey Zimmerman and Claud Price ﬁn-
ished one-‘two-three in the mile.
Brand and Zimmerman are also run-
ning the half-mile for West Vir-
ginia. Watkins is Pitt's best bet in
these events and may win one of
them. . _

In the shorter runs, Harris, V1-
tulla, Monheim and Utterback am
competing for the Panthers. Gor-
dan Fr‘a:ser,.-wh-o took ‘the 70-yard
sprint in the indoor meet, is back
and he is favored to take both the
100 and 220-yard dashes. However,
the Panthers should sweep the 440-
yard run.
LUCH OPPOSITION

Captain Charley Hill, winner of
the triathlon weight test at the Ohio
Relays, ought to win all the weight
events. Luch and Carver will fur-
nioh his main opposition. Knopnicki,
javelin thrower and place winner in
the Ohio Relays should be able to
toss the spear farther than any of
the Mountaineers. A

West Virginia seems to have the

loway, who has been going over the
timbers for West Virginia for four
years now, and who took fourth
place in -the Ohio Relays, seems al-
most sure to win these events. Mar-
shall Lewis is running for Pitt. _

Galloway is also high jumﬁin but
Utterback and Kirkpatrick s ou dbe
able to beat him. In the broad
jump, on which Utterback has a
stranglehold, Waggoner is represent-
ing the Mountaineers.

Manager Plan Urged
By Boots In Speech

The Exchange Club of Pittsburgh
heard Dr. Ralph S. Boots, acting
head of the department of Political
Science, speak on “The City Man-
ager Plan” Tuesday, May 5, in the
William Penn Hotel.

Dr. Boots has gained a nation-
wide reputation as an authority on,
municipal administration, and has

With more than 1,200 athletes
from about 75 high schools of Penn-
sylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio
entered, the twenty-fourth annual
Pitt Interscholastic track and ﬁeld

meet, being held tomorrow at the
Pitt stadium, promises to be one of
the best in its history.

The Pitt meet is one of the oldest
hi h school events in Western Penn-
sy vania. First held in 1908. it has
become a ﬁxture which furnishes
the younger athletes from here-
abouts an opportumty .to show what
they can do. It also gives the spec-
tators more thrills than is forthcom-
ing in most college meets.

Meet Uncontested

Due to the scarcity of rival meets
in this territory tomorrow, the P_1tt
meet has a greater number of In-
dividual stars than ever before. In
previous years such meets as the
West Virginia Interscholastics. the
Geneva College Interscholastics. the
Beaver County Interscholast_1cs,- and
several others drew outstanding per-
formers to their competition. his
year, however, the Geneva Collegtea
meet has already been run off, t
West Virginia meet has been can-
celled, the Pennsylvania State meet
will be held at some future date, and
onl the Beaver County meet is fur-
nis 'ng a rival attraction. _
It is expected that several rec-

order will be _broken _ tomorrow.
Among those which are likely to fall
are the hundred-yard dash, the shot
put, the discus and javelin throws.
and possibly the 440-yard run.

The century run this year looks_ to
be as good a. race as last year, which
is saying something. In the dash
last year there were four runners
competing who were all given, an
equal chance to win and also to break
the record of ten seconds. These men
were Milligan of Peabody, now at
Pitt; Bohlender of Grove City, Pry-
or of Ford City,‘ and Dooms of
Uniontown. The race, which was
bring forth a new _.recor_d,: did fur-g
nish the expected thrills. .

100 A -Thriller ’

This year two of the above four
are entered along with several oth-
ers who will take the place of Mil,-
ligan and Bohlender. Pryor and
Dooms, both colored boys, are again
favored to ﬁght it out for the victory
with added competition from Greens-
berg of New Castle, Anderson and
McBurney of Washington, Redd of -
Uniontown, Siegel of Bellevue, Arne-
man of strong Vincent, and Schei—

Eddie Jacobs, Star of Panthers:
Team Shows Exceptional
Ability On Trip

The Panther tennis team returned
home from their Eastern trip with
a clean sweep of Victories.‘ Thurs-
day they defeated George Washing-
ton University and Friday they de-
feated Georgetown University. The
match with Navy was called off be-
cause of a heavy rain that had fallen
the day before.

The best. tennis that has been
played by the Blue and Gold squad
was played on this trip. The com-
petition was thekeenest that can
be given in intercollegiate tennis
and Pitt kept their slate clean in
great style.

JACOBS WINS

Eddie Jacobs encountered two of
the best men now playing collegiate
tennis beside himself. In his ﬁrst
match with Frank Considine, runner-
up of the National Public Parks
championship, he had things quite
-his own way and won very handily
with the scores of 6-0, 6-4. His well
earned victory was against Gregory
Mangin, sixth ranking player in the
country. In all of his other e.n-count-
ers with Mangin he has always come
out on the short end, but last Fri-
day he played superb tennis and de-
feated him 6-4, 3-6, 6-2.

Eddie paired with Goodman, won
both of their double’ matches, play-
ing great tennis together, especially
in their match against Gregory Man-
gin and Dooly Mitchell, third rank-
mg player in the middle West.

feat since he has been representing

Injuries sustained in the inter-
fraternity track meet may force the
Pitt Frosh tennis team to meet the
Duquesne plebes this afternoon
minus the services of Nate Ganger.
The number two man of the team,
fell as he was going over the hur-
dles and sprained his right arm.
Kulczycky may substitute in his po-
sition.

Tomorrow the Washington and
Jefferson Frosh netters will meet the
Gold and Blue Yearlings at Wash-
ington. The game was postponed
because of the inclement weather.
OPEN SEASON “

The Pitt freshmen netters opened
their delayed tennis season against
the Wilkinsburg net team by play-
mg a tie match.

Billie Jacobs opened the match by
trouncing Oetting 6-0 and 6-1. O.et-
ting_wa.s no match for Jacobs who
continually had his opponent run-
ning around the court. In the first
set, “Billie” lost only three points.
GANGER WINS

N-ate Ganger playing position
number two opened his collegiate
tennis career by deefating Grier 6-0,
6-1. Ganger’s back hand was work-
ing‘ exceptionally well and Grier, the
Wilkinsburg netter, did not have a
chance for victory. In the second
set, Ganger and Grier had som-e nice
volleys but Gangexr’s ﬁnishing drives
were too much for Grier who ﬁnally
was beaten.

John DeWitt playing number
-three for the Pitt fxro/sh could not
cope with Elliot who won 6-2, 6-2.

Burnett of Wilkinsburg defea
Goldstein 6-2, 6-2. '

The Pitt number one doubles team
of Ganger and Jacobs crashed
throng-h the Wilkinsburg team of
Smith and Maxwell for two love
sets. The opponentsof this Pitt net
doubles team did not have a chance
against the two famous junior ten-
nis stars. Jacobs’ dynamic service
worked perfectly and Gang-er
backed him up with that smooth
driving fore-hand. These two net-
ters could give many a college var-
sity team a stiff ﬁght for net hon-
ors.

DOUBLES TEAM LOSES

Kulczycky and Schwartz closed
the net program by losing to Elliot

and Burnett. Tho-ugh the scores of

7-5, 1-6,.4—6 does indicate that the
Pitt second team put up a strong
ﬁght.‘ Kulczycky showed great-
promlse and much can be expected"

HE SPRING FESTIVAL is
‘ ‘over, successful, and thor-
f . oughly enjoyed; From an enter-

’ tainment standpoint, it was a com-
-,, plete triumph. The events were
 well" attended; they were sulfi-
- ciently varied and a spirit of gay-

ety predominated over the _entire

campus. George Boggs, chairman,
,M.a.ry Munsch, co-chairman, and

the members of their committees
are to be congratulated for tne
‘ease with which the whole pro-
v gram was conducted. _
' Now to sound a dissenting _note
. . .faint but we believe entirely
in order. The Spring Festival
took the time of every student,
particularly. those who partici-
pated in the events. It is a ques-
.tjo.n whether it is wise to sacriﬁce
this time with the end of school so
. near at hand. Examinationis are

_to be taken, term papers com-
pleted and back work brought up
 to date. A week-end lost in May
makes everything just so much
1 more difﬁou-lt.

‘ ﬂ Tlliose in charge of the Festival
 advocated it becazuse they opined
that Senior week never proved a
" success inasmuch as‘ school had
closed. The earlier date for the
events would make them much
more successful. Last week-end
proved that these persons were
correct in their assertions.

Yet, when plans for the Festival
were first discussed. there was to
be no elaborate program extend-
,ving over three days. The events

were to be comparatively few and

conﬁned to one day.
‘_ May this then be the ord-er next
‘year! Let there be a May day
"celebration, for the early date _in-
», sures’ la‘ greater display of inter-
 est in the events. Let there also
,. fewer events, that the distrac-
 ‘ tion from study be not so strong
' at this particular time of the year.

..',,Staid old Ca/rnegie Music Hall
«must have received the shock of
/its life on Varsity Night. What a.
_“-rowdy-dowdy, hunky-panky get-

together that u'a.s.". .but hurm.les_s
.' withul. It was just about the bést

--time Pitt ‘has had since the

. Tech game pep pa/rode. A special
so/lute . goes to Ben Sufrine, ener-
getic chairman.

Players Take Bow

~ , IT’I‘ PLAYERS ARE about to
;_; ‘conclude another year of pro-
fduction activity next Thursday
with the presentation of Barrie’s
_‘_‘Al.ice Sit by the Fire.”
i , For fifteen years, this organiza-
' -tion. of ambitious and talented
_thespians has had scores of stu-
dents included among its mem-
bers. During that period the group
" has attained a broad gI‘0W¢l1 and
has developed much latent ability
gin its members,
, . This year, the first under the
 supervision of a full-time director,
it? has been the most auspicious one
 . since the Players were established
i  the campus‘. Three well acted
~ and adequately staged full-length
ﬂdramas, and a host of one—act
plays and sketches, many of which
 directed by students, have
comprised the program of the
Players for the present school
term.

v.There is place for such a dra-
. ‘Vmstic organization as Pitt Play-
 jers. at the University. Once the
’_ xgroup has gained a little more con-
 ﬁdence in itself and a little more
umpport from the student body,
r -. even more ambitious efforts may
be expected. Perhaps Shakes-

peare! Maybe even Tolstoi! As

min

B’ mounted policemen rode into the’

it is now, Cap and Gown is not
the only student organization that
is doing commendable theatrical

work.

It seemed like a fraternity con-
vention on campus this week.
Everybody went floating about
with impormnt looking tags at-
tached to themselves. Two my
days within a. week make a col-
lege education pretty much of a.
luxury.

Coeds Play Host

NIVERSITY COEDS again

play host to women of other
Western Pennsylvania colleges to-
monrow in the sixth annual Play
Day sponsored by the Women's
Athletic Association.

Pitt women have taken a lead
among coed groups in seeking to
establish more friendly contacts
and associations with their sisters
in other institutioris. Play Day
brings together several hundred
students, the interests of whom
are primarily the same, whether
it be in studies, recreation or the
problems with which the modern
young woman ﬁnds herself con-
fronted. Play Day affords an op-
portunity for exchange of ideas
and experiences. This is where its
value lies.

A survey of the program for to-
m:or-row also shows that college
women are a.ppar.ently leaving lit-
tle in the sport line to the exclu-

 

  
 

sive use of their brothers. H-_ockey, -

mushba.ll, tennis and jumping are
some of the events on the Play
Day program. In another half
dozen years one may well expect
to see football added to this list.
It is typical of the freedom and
independence of the present day
college women.

Tomorrow should be a ﬁne get-
together day and Pitt extends its
full measure of hospitality most
gladly.

Athletics are not the only
things over-emphasized in college
according to the demon student
relations committee. The under-
graduate is too much of a social
butterfly in the opinion of this
group, ever mindful of the stu-
dent’s well-being. The committee
Irecom-mended this weak a. curtail-
ment of the University social cal-
endar. In answer, ﬁve fraternities
and three sororities blossomed
forth with announcement of coun-
try club formula next Friday. Just
. one of the little whimsicalitics that
make college life what it is.’

Sociology Professor
Gets Research Post

Frederick F. St_e—phan, assistant-

professor of sociology, has accepted
a position as director of the newly

his duties on July 1. He will con-
tinue to teach his course in Methods

Hatless girls and knicker-clad

who proudly ﬂaunts a yellow
0. D. K. ribbon, wears a gray
knicker suit, and calls every-
body else who does a “sissy.”
PATTY MCLEAN, who looks
very Janet Gaynorish with her
permanent, looks trimmer and
sweeter than ever in her blue
and white boucle suit and her
black and white sports shoes.
Various outdoor sports are be-
ing t en up by the leisure set
who, cording to BUD REED,
are getting their education by
reading the Harvard Classic ﬁf-
teen minutes a day. TOMMY
SAVAGE and TOMMY MUS-
GRAVE wile away their free

' hours by tossing quarters and
half-dollars against the curb
back of Alumni Hall; all in fun,
of course. GILDAS METOUR
has a spring racket all his own;
he is rushing around getting all
the Kappas to take a chance on
his punchboard. ELEANOR
KNAPP on spring days likes to
assume an ancient Cileopatrian
posture on the back of a road-
ster, gallantly supporting her
head on the hand off a gentil-
homme in the front seat.

The Sports’ Dance at the Ur-
ban_Room was one of the best
dances this year; w-e heartily
agree with BOB MACHESNEY
in endorsing the Urban Room
for more Pitt dances, especially
the formal ones. About the best
looking couple on the ﬂoor was
JIM McCULLOUGH, last year's
Senior Ball chairman, who
looked smoother than ever i-n his
white lineln suit, and DO'I'I‘IE
GETZING-E-R, who looked sweet
in her pretty. blue -lace dress.
One novel feature about the

‘ dance was the doughnut feast
provided by a dance in the ball-
room. We saw CARL DIS;TLE-
HORST, of the Accounting De-
partment, WILMA MACKEY
of the College oﬂice, ART
GEORGE‘and HOWARD
STONEIMAH, students, helping
themselves.

Friday was a busy day. No.
classes axfter second hour, but
Tapping Assembly, Parade and
Sweepstakes from 10:30 on.
JEAN STOTLER wants to be
congratulated as the only one
honored at Tap Assembly by not
being tapped. We’re so glad
about the honor bestowed‘ upon
R0-SEMARIE DEMESTICHAS;
there is one time-in the whole
school more worthy. In the Pa-
rade’ of the Pamtherettes, the
TRI-DELTS had their usual
misfortune. They had hired
costumes, and for a, week, DOR-
OTHY BIDDLE and GLADYS
PYLE had practiced driving
horses and carts as “Ben Hur.”
At the last minute the horses
proved too wild even for Dot
and Gladys, -and an Austin had
to be , entered as “Ben Hur
1931.” In the Sweepstakes, the
S. A. E.’s‘ didn’t do so well ac-
cording‘ to RAY MONTGOM-
ERY, judge; due possibly to the
sprained ankle of REDS WO-
MACK who usually was great
help at the last lap. ’

Varsity Nite had great possi-
bilities. The acts were very
good and well executed; the au-
dience should have been. BOB
KLEEB makes a tricky mas-
sacre’ of ceremonies, especially
when he tells us how he “made
the pledge.” The best acts on
the program were, of course, the
Marx impersonation, by SUN-
NY WESLAGER, the Panther
advertiser and the trio, THREE
SHADES OF BLUE. Inciden-
tally, a man who hwrd BU-
ENTE, WEISMAN and
HATCHER .8lt Varsity liked
them so well that he has signed
them up to sing at a Whoosis
Banquet at the Central Y. M.
C. A. GENE KELLY deserves
commendation for his “Waiting
for the Ships that Never Come
I-n,” even more than for his tap
dancing; Gene, you know, has
worked on Keith Circuit during
the -summer.

Well, keep your chin up.

Last week before the parade of
the Pantherettes, the ﬂoats were
lined up preparing to go; The T.
P. A.’s “Tom Sawyer," the Delta
Zeta’s “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” the Z.
T. A.’s “Byrd at the North Pole,”
etc. Suddenly one of the witty gir-lies
spied an old rag man laboriously
whipping ‘his bony horse and yelling
“Rags, 01’ iron.”

“Wait,”_yelled the waggish femme,
“here comes the ﬂoat from the
School of Business Administration.”

An old lady was passing as the
boys whizzed by on their “whoopees”
in the Sweepstakes. Curiously she
craned her neck. shaded her eyes
and looked aston-
ished. “I can see why they have a‘
boy driving,” she said, “but who is
that lazy fellow on behind?”
“Madam,” we bowed obsequiously,
“that is a stowaway.”

This department and Charles Beck
wish to thank you and you and you
for the tolerant way you received
the act at the Varsity Night Affair.
The applause softened these hard-
ened hearts, and we did it all for
the love of the stage and to make
you (sniﬂ, sniﬁ) happy. Also Pitt
Players are grateful for the won-
derful way you received their oifer-
ing, and for all the money you
threw!

Since the Pitt in China Camrpaign

Paul Kulick tells us about how
Abe Savage would fill his column
without any arduous labor when he
penned for the “Weekly.” It seems
that Abe would need about 4 para-
graphs to complete his material,
and he would be at a loss for ideas.
Simply and efficiently he would
leave the space blank, and write at
the top, “Picture of a Snow Storm.”

, The place smelt of clean starched sheets, dried lavender, and wild
crabapple perfume of which Gra.nd’mere was extremely fond. From, the .
west window the last orange rays of the sun gave this transplanted bit
of France on old world warmth and friendliness. It outlined the fat,
stiuatty plumeau on the foot of the bed that promised the warmth of
many sacks of goosefeathers. Wavering‘, it struck thecarved prie-dieu
on t erother side of the bed, bringing out the polish of the black-walnut
and making Christ on his black cross sag more pathetically. Across ’
the room the cream-tinted walls and the drapes of dull gold looked brighte
