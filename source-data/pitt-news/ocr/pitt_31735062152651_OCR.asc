hoax ‘since, the ‘Senior Engineers turn;

"a faculty cemetery in‘190‘8;in being‘is-

ded expose of the fraternities proves

to" _be. a pure burlesque of the Univer-

thing. beneath the froth of the fake
attack it isva» real boost for the fra-
ternities. ' A _ ' V _ '
Fear that something antagoriistic
to fraternities _would appear in this
issue caused several of the fraterni-,
ties in the medical and dental.depart-
ments to pass boycott ‘resolutions

members were asking if the exposures‘
would be. ofa; serious. nature. '

Now. that it is known that nothing
serious has been attempted, and that
the policy’ of the Panther is strictly
one of amusement, those who were
taken ’in byvthe neat bit of advertis-
ing are having sighs of relief and buy-

tions are brou ht from the- press. A

With. everyone of the half—hundre
men, present taking an active part in
the service of Thanksgiving. held by
the Young," Men’s Christian Associa-
tion last Monday morning, Thaw hall
chapel, was the sceneof the most suc-
cessful meeting that the association
has held this year.

Although Rev. A. H. Ackley, who
waste. have played a cello solo, was
unable tobe present, the musicfwas a
«feature, on ‘account of the‘ splendid
"chorus , singing of the crowd, which
was -under the leadership of E. B.
Hurrell, and a quartette, “Saviour,
With~Thee,” by James Ma-yne, ‘H. N."
i.Mawhinney, K. M. Gould, and E. B.

ing towardthe general topic ‘of “Grati-

the privilege of attending an institu-

-tion of higher learning; the 'year’s

good harvest; and theppeace of Amer-
ica, the only nation of any consequence
