Student Senate
Discusses

Many Topics

Senators discussed topics rang-
ing from concern about ‘student
knowledge of campus life to -an
extension of the student section
in the stadium at Monday's Stu-
dent Government meeting.

Jacque Wertheimer, expressed
a fear that the average student
does not know enough about the
University and its administration
and asked if any steps have- been
taken to further communication
in this area.

Bernard Adams, SG administra-
tive advisor, replied that a dis-
play is planned for the fall which
would show students how the

’University will look in the near

future.

Beth Baumgart registered a
complaint about the size of class-
es with.“the best professors.” She
also disagreed with lecture-recb
tation separation. V

Elect President Pro-Tem

Jay Fingeret was elected presi-
dent pro-tem of the Senate, and
Ruth Maguire was elected chap-
lain. Three more open seats were
also ﬁlled by election. Bob Row-
ley was elected senior senator,
and the two new freshmen sen-
ators -are Ralph Kassou and
Claude Lair. Engineering
Mines senators are still needed.

Pat Teeters, current president
of the Senate, announced that
due to personal circumstances
she would give her gavel to the
newly elected ‘president pro-tem
for an ensuing short time.

Ruth Maguire, chairman of the
Pep Club, reported that the second
quadranglepep rally showed stu-
dent spirit to be improving.

She announced that almost three
buses arefilled for the Syracuse
game in Syracuse. It is emphasized
that no, one who goes to the game
in these student buses may stay
overnight.

Bob Slotkin announced that Dr.
John Geise, Assistant Chancellor
for Student Affairs, has approved
an addition to the area allowed
for the student section in the sta-
dium. Senators felt that this is
definitely necessary.

WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1961

Chancellor to Speak  

Monday in Ballroom

Residence Council Encourages

Closer Ties With Administration. ‘W

Men’s Residence Council

announced today that Chan-

cellor Litchﬁeld will speak to the student body at .8‘ pm.

Monday in the SU Ballroom.

Ed Hall, a Men’s Residence ‘Council representative, said
that “the purpose of inviting the chancellor in to speak is to
encourage a closer relationship between the student body

and the administration, and to aid¢

the students in knowing the chan-
cellor as a person.

“It was feltthat most students
know the chancellor only as that
powerful man who sits in his of-

ﬁce making important decisions
and announcements to the press.”

The Council stated that the

chancellor is interested in .en-
couraging closer relations be-
tween the students and the ad-
ministration, and feels that in-
viting other administrators in
to speak will create a stronger
school spirit and greater under-
standing of the University and
the men who take part in its
operation.

Council saidthat, although the
Chancellor has not devulged the
topic of his speech, they are sure
it will be of “great importance
and interest to‘ every student,”

The address was planned this
past summer and _the ararnge-
ments were made by Inter—Dorm
/Council. it

Dick Jones, a Holland Hall
representative, commented "“I
think that it will bring the
chancellor in closer with the
students. Otherwise they
wouldn’t get a chance to meet
him, except to hear him at Con-
vocation.”

Men’s Residence Council has
also planned dormitory discussion
groups for Monday evening. The
possible topics for discussion in-
clude “What does the University
expect of its students?" “Advan-
tages of dormitory living on the
trimester plan,” and “Of what
value is residence hall living,
both for a social and academic

education?”

Yearly Plans Discussed

The first organizational . meeting
of this year’s Men’s Residence
Halls Council was held last Thurs-
day evening. The purpose of this
meeting was to discuss plans for
the coming year.

It will be the responsibility of
the council to plan, approve, and
coordinate social and recreational
activities within the residence
halls. I

As one of its objectives, the
council intends to go beyond the
usual business of planning so-
cial functions by becoming a
voice of student opinion on an
unlimited range of subjects.

During the past two weeks, each
residence hall elected a president
and» other oﬂicers who will plan
and organize activities. Each pres-
ident automatically ‘becomes a

member of the council, which is

Dorm Councils Organize

the official representative group
for all on-campus students. I

An executive committee will be
chosen by the council in order to
facilitate its own operation.

The newly elected members of
the council from Holland Hall are
Leroy Henry, Al Schlosser, Pete
Bijur, Dick Jones and Ron Billy. .

In Schenley Hall they are Wal-
-ter Smith, John Cardot, Donald
Osborne, Steve Kessman, and Ed-
ward Hall.

The representatives from Salk
Hall are Fred Schmeisser and
Schuyler Houser. Al Ricciuti rep-
resents Varsity Hall and the Dith-
ridge House representative is Andy
Markus.

The council will work with the
representative body of the Wom-
an’s Residence Halls on any mat-
ter that concerns both groups. 1 A‘

IF Open Rush  
Starts Today;  
Ends Oct. 11 I

Open Rush for men started to-
day and ends at 4 pm. next Wed-
nesday,
President Art Pape announced.

Any fraternity wishing to pledge
a man may do so by turning a bid
card in to the Dean of Men’s Of-
fice, 801 C1. Rusheesl may pick up
bids there during Open Rush. I

This fall, 204 new pledges joined
the 16 fraternities. This is a
marked decrease from last year’s
total of 275. But Pape said that
“considering the cut in the num-
ber of freshmen this fall, we’re
still pleased with the total of those
accepting bids.” ‘

‘Pleased’ With Rush

Pape continued. “We feel that
the longer pre-rush quiet period
of three weeks enables the fresh-
men to make better decisions."

“Voluntary observance of the
regulations was much better this
year than last,” he added. ,

The number of pledges for each
fraternity is as follows:

Alpha Phi Alpha, four; Delta
Sigma Phi, 19; Delta Tau Delta, 16;
Kappa Nu, 23.

Phi Ep Gets 23

Lambda Chi Alpha, six; Omega

pense of the publication of the In-
terfraternity Rush Handbook.

rushees-who picked up bids from
a fraternity was made available

Paren ts ' Weekend .

Next weekend parents of at least 150 upperclassmen
and women will visit the college of their oﬂsprings’ choice
-toenjoy three days of university life with them.

The depth shown by initiating such a program at a
university of this size does creditto Jane Batchelder and
her Parents’ Weekend committee. For the first time the

" important relationship of students and parents as well as
students and university has been recognized.

_ In the past, organizations on campus have emphasized
better student- relations with faculty, administrators and

sity family. Discussion groups were set up to encourage in-
formal roundtables on all phases of the university, its ef-
fect on students and vice versa. 7

Such programs were stressed especially for freshmen
' who. must make the transition from home to campus in one
easy orientation week. To continue the program, adminis-
trators and student leaders then guided the adapting fresh-
‘men through a series of panel shows designed to absorb
the’ lost souls into the University family and to make them
./-feel‘ at home away from home. The emphasis was on the
‘maturing student, gaining his independence in the univer-
sity world.

And once the student reached his sophomore year, the
assimilation was complete. He was completely at home on
this large campus. But something was lost in the transition.

Dorm students often became» strangers in their par-
ents’ eyes and the wonder of modern day_ colleges and
their mores shocked many of the older generation. In like
manner, commuters often used home only as a place to eat
and sleep before they were off to the library, the Student
Union, or the mysterious Tuck Shop. I

With the introduction of Parents’ Weekend many of
these mysteries will be solved in part at least, and stu-
dents a.nd parents will be given the opportunity to ex-
perience a togetherness seldom known on a university
campus.

On. Folk-Singing

By Matthew Nesvisky
Folk—singing is “in.”

As a matter of fact, folk-singing is just about
the “innest” form o.f entertainment ,for today’s
young v sophisticated set. Collegians are packing
the most spidery espresso par-
lors and the classiest concert
halls every night to caterwaulv
along with the many guitar-
plunking, tub-pounding trios,
quartets, quintets and, if you
will pardon the term, sextets on
stage. ' i

The popularity of folk-sing- V
ing is easily explained. Every-
body likes it. 1

But more difficult
plain is the

to ex-
folk-song it- I -
(Leonard, the SU
janitor), a‘ folk-song is a melodic ballaid_which
originates in the heritage of folk. Folk, of course,
are "those people who, in addition to being con-
stantly old and at home, invent songs.
Janitorial? ,
In rare cases, howeverﬁa janitorial deﬁnition of
a ‘word is inadequate. In order to feel the intoxi-
cating magic of this musical phenomenon, it is
necessary to look at a sampling of a genuine folk
lyric:
There’s three gates to the east, /
Three gates to the west,
Three gates to the north,
Three gates to the south,
Twelve gates to the city.
Oh, what a beautiful city,
Oh, what, a beautiful city,
Oh, what a beautiful city,
Twelve gates to the city.
Doubtlessly, you were moved to tears. One can-
not help but receive the song’s intrinsic Message;
that exhilarating, inspiring, passionate, soul-elevat-
ing, arch-lifting outcry’ to the world: There’s lotsa
gates to the city.

Student Concerned
About Handicapped

This year there has been a-

noticeable increase in the num-
ber of disabled students attend-
ing classes at Pitt. Has the Uni-
versity adapted itself to accom-
modate these students?

Now that the fall term has
begun, Committee Cora, Ollie
Organizer, Colleen Columnist,
Executive Ed, Dottie DoGooder.
Adolph Administrator, and Poli-
tician Paul are pondering the
possibilities for purposeful plans
to propose. ~

Perhaps they could turn their
attention to the problems which
result from lack of provision
for students who are unable to

push their way_thro1,i_gh revolv-,

the University of Pittsburgh; it
is nation-wide. Among the 3,-
910,000 students either entering
or returning to the nation’s col-
leges and universities this fall,
the number with physical dis-
abilities is the highest in history.

The notable school from which
to take example is the University
of Illinois which has adapted it-
self to meet the needs of these
students. Their specialized facili-
ties and programs for the handi-
capped include s e v e n t y - ﬁve
ramps leading into university
buildings, four buses with hy-
draulic lifts which go around
the campus on a regular sched-
ule, specia‘l parking facilities and
modiﬁed apartments for married
whcel—chair students.

Similarly, at the University‘ of
Missouri all of the University
services have been modiﬁed in
such ways that the handicapped
can. attend with 31 ‘minimum of
inconvenience. The emphasis
t.here has been toward modiﬁca-
tion of testing and counciling
services, men’s ‘dormitories, the
student union, and student health
services. '

Several other universities have
embarked on similar programs
with success. Among these are
the Kansas State Teachers Col-
lege, the State University of New
York, the College of Education
in BufTalo,.and the University of
Florida.

In a nation that is committed
as a public policy—to the prin-
ciple of providing higher _edu-,

handicapped students. Much can
be done to aid these students in
adapting to life at Pitt.

Tough Scheduling to

Bear Down on Cats

Starting this Saturday, with a
contest against Akron University
at Akron, the Panther booters get
into the meet of the toughest soc-
cer schedule in Pitt history.

On successive weekends the Cats
face Akron, Michigan State, St.
Louis, Howard U., and West Ches-
ter, with Slippery Rock and Grove
City thrown in on weekdays.

Akron gave storm warnings of
its potential power last week by
downing St. Louis, defending na-
tional champion, 3-2 in areally
exciting game. I

The Zips have a three—time All-

American, Fritz Kungl, cavorting ‘

American at center-forward
Frank Abel.

“They’re -good all around—-
speed on the wings, good full-
backs, and a ﬁne goalie.” This is
Bemis’ appraisal of the Akron
team that he saw in action Sat-
urday afternoon, after guiding
his charges to a 4-0 win over
Ohio U.

The Zips Whipped Pitt 8-0 last
year to‘ even the all—time series
record at 2-2 between the two
schools, and the Panthers are anx-

in

feat. “We had ﬁve regulars out
with injuries last season,” says
Bemis, and that isn’t likely to
happen again.”
Few Injuries

In fact, the squad is in top phy-
sical condition. for this Saturday’s
battle. Minor injuries to Sam Don-

and only Alberto Sichel isn’t ex-‘
pected to see action.

Coach Bemis was satisﬁed with
his team’s showing at Ohio U. last
week,.but he realizes that to beat
Akron “the boys will have to play
the best game of soccer played
around here for a long time.”

downtrodden turf of a sad

Pitt Stadium. Now they have to
revive .themselves to meet the

The task will not be an easy
one, and neither will the game.
Some of the Panthers have vir-
tually discounted the defending
Rose Bowl champions as a threat.

But their convincing win over
Illinois on Saturday should con-
vince the doubtful Cats that they
are formidable, especially in their

A Huskies Play
Possession Ball

defeated Illinois, the Huskies

showed almost complete disdain?

of the air lanes by attempting
only four passes and completing
none. _ .

If Coach Jim Owens decides to
cross up the Panthers and go to
an aerial game the burden will
fall on the shoulders of Quarter-
back Kermit Jorgenson. He has
proven himeslf to be an adequate
passer but his main forte is run-
ning.

Mitchell Poses Threat

The big thorn _in the Panthers’
side on Saturday should be Char-
lie Mitchell. He ranks as Wash-
ington’s fastest back in the last
five years, and as a sophomore
last year he led the team in rush-
ing average. Mitchell ranks as a
standout on defense also.

Joining Mitchell and Jorgen-
son in the backﬁeld are Soph-
omore Dave Kopay and Junior

Fullback Bob’ Monroe. Kopay

relies on power to produce his

yardage, while Monroe, small
for a fullback, at 180 pounds,

depends on speed. K

The line is ‘anchored by All-
American candidate Jim Skagzgs.
Skaggs returns to guard this year
after having served at end last
year due to a lack of depth at
that position. He is a standout on
offense and defense.

Chief Targets Restless

If the Huskies should go to a
passing game, the other targets
of J orgenson’s aerial artistry will
be Glenn Kezer, Lee Bernhardi

and Andy Alkire. Alkire is the C

only ‘one, with previous experi-
ence at end, which probably! ac-
counts for the Huskies’ lack of
passing. Even he spent part of

played both center an halfback
last year-

Tackles John Meyers and Rod
Scheyer team with Guard Dave
‘Phillips and Center Ray Mans-
ﬁeld to join Skaggs, Alkire and
Bernhardi in forming a line that
averages 213 pounds.

The game shapes up as a battle
between a strong Panther defen-
sive line against . an explosive
Washington ground attack. The
much-maligned Pitt pass defense
does not ﬁgure to have too much
work to do on Saturday. If the
line can hold up it will be a long
afternoon for the Huskies.

trying out for the frosh wrest-

Hold Key To
Upset of Lions

As the _Pant:her harriers busily
prepare to invade the lair ofthe
Nitanny Lions of Penn State,
Coach Carl Rees is convinced that
his team will put up a good show-
ing against the defending ICAA
champions.

Pitt’s primary hope for an upset
lies on the results of last year’s
frosh encounter between the two
squads, a meet in which the Pitt
yearlings downed the Lion Cubs,’
22-33. '_

Bill Mocnik took individual
honors in that race, with Larry
Robinson, Steve ' Waslo, Bob
Henry, and A. J. Rice copping
positions four through seven.

“If our men run like they’re
capable of running,” remarked
Rees, “there should be some sur-
prises.” The Pitt mentor believes
that Waslo, who has led the Pan-
ther runners i.n both meets this
season, will again come through

inson, Mocnik, an d Tarkany
should also be near the top.”
Nevertheless, the Lions, a peren-
nial track and cross-country pow-
erhouse, have their second, third,
and fourth varsity runners return-
ing to a team which outclassed

Pitt last year, 19-40.

A casual observer might
think that Freshman Coach
Bill Kaliden was carrying
sportsmanshipa bit too far
by pasting a Kent State decal
on his red Oldsmobile con-
vertible. However, Kaliden has no
love for his team's opponent of

there by his sister who is a stu-
dent at the Ohio‘school.

The Golden Flashes of Kent
State will be vieing for their first
win over the frosh since 1955
when they entertain them tomor-
row. Last year the Pittsburgh
crew triumphed 48-O.

Kent State is suffering from the
same malady as the Cubs, lack
of practice among themselves.
Coach Dick Paskert cites his
team’s biggest asset as backﬁeld
speed. He has two ﬁne quarter-
backs in Bill Lee and John Sarsen
to «run a split T offense, he said
during a phone conversation.

Kaliden may have to leave

Kaliden has not named a start-
ing lineup and said, “The starting
lineup won’t mean anything ‘since
everyone is going to get an equal
Chance to play. '

Sees Extra Duty

‘One boy that may see extra
duty is Bill Bodie of Deerﬁeld,
Illinois. Kaliden has Bodie slated
to see action at left and right
halfback besides fullback.

Neither Paskert or Kaliden
would predict a winner for the
game. Results since 1949 show

that the Panthers have a 10-1

edge. Kaliden and his crew hope
to make it 11 out of 12 tomorrow.
