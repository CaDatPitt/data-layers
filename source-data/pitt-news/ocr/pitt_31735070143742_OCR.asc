Along with easy living, the
summer breeze blew in easy

breathing. .

Through June, July and Au?

gust, in particular, Pittsburgh ex-
perienced a peculiar weather pat-
tern, according to Rich Kane of
the National Weather Service.

As a result, the number of
air quality action days indicat-
ing harmful concentrations of
ground-level ozone decreased,
and people at risk from ozone
and ﬁne particulate pollution —
children, the elderly and those
with respiratory diseases ——~— were
better able to enjoy the warm
weather without worry.

cially during August. when the av-
erage temperature was less than
average at 69.7, and the rain left
town for days, Kane conﬁrmed.

1 “There were less air quality ac-
tion days, in part because it was a
generally cool summer,” said Sean
Nolan of the Southwest Pennsyl-
vania Air Quality Partnership. “It
was a much better summer than
last summer.”

From June through August,
there were 13 ozone action days,
down from 25 in 2007, and four
ﬁne particulate action days, down
from 14. August experienced only
one air quality action day.

“Ozone is a summertime phe-
nomenon,” said Nolan.

networking

their loans

by Caitlyn Christensen
For T /96 Pitt New

A newly formed company has
combined the powers of social
networking, microﬁnance and
the Internet with the ambition
of making student loans efﬁcient
and attainable.

GreenNote, an
online alternative loan company,
now offers students another
lending option for ﬁnancing their
educations.

“My business philosophy is
very simple,” said Akash Agarwal,
co—founder and CEO of Green-

exclusively

-Note. “I believe that there is a tre-

mendous amount of money out
there, and students should be able
to get that money without credit
ratings or high interest. Through
the power of the Internet, tech-
nology and joining small amounts
of money together, we should be
able to help them.”

Pitt’s Ofﬁce .of Financial Aid
reported that 3,700 students at
Pitt applied for alternative loans
during the 2008-09 school year.
Alternative loans usually cost
more than federal_loans and typi-
cally have variable interest rates.

students also designate how much
money they need to ﬁnance their
educations —— this can be as little
as $1,000 or it can be the entire
cost of four years of schooling.

The sun_ long set, embers ﬂared
up against the chilly air, brightening
the small area around a hookah pipe
on a table outside Litchﬁeld Towers
Tuesday night.

r A group of‘ students huddled
together around the table, passing
the pipe and exhaling honey melon
fumes. V

“I’m not invincible, it’s just I’m

_not worried right now,” said Chel-

sea McCune, a freshman hookah
smoker. “If the time comes and" my
health is compromised, I’ll have to
quit smoking, but right now I’m not
worried about it.” A
McCune, who also smokes
cigarettes, said she started smoking
hookah when she turned.18. She

said that the taste of the tobacco

and the social aspect of smoking

, aretwo ofgthe  that turned
' her onto hookah. ’ .

“It feels better [than smoking a
cigarette] because, for whatever rea-
son, you don’t taste all those chemi-.
cals,” said McCune,

But whether‘ smokers such as
McCune taste the chemicals or not,
Brian Primack, a doctor and pro-
fessor at University of Pittsburgh

School of Medicine, said that theyfre .

there. ‘ . 
Although the medical commu-

nity doesn’t know the exact health ‘

effects of hookah use, Primack said
that the same tar and nicotine found
in cigarettes is found in hookah to-
bacco.”

“The information that we do
have suggests that [smoking hoo-
kah] is going to be equivalent to a

cigarette habit,” he said.

Primack conducted a smoking
study last April in which he surveyed
3,600 randomly chosen students at
Pitt Via ‘e—mail. University Comput-
ing Services provided the students’
e—mail addresses and demographic
information, such as age, housing
situation and race, to the study with
the permission of the University
vice provost. T

responded. Forty percent of the
respondents said that they had

ily members, friends and community lead-
ers. The lenders pledge a certain amount
of money to contribute toward the lump
sum. * .
Students don’t need a credit rating to
determine their eligibility, because they
borrow from friends and family members
interested in helping them. For this same
reason, GreenNote has no co-signer re-
quirement either, Akash said.

After a six—month grace period follow-
ing graduation, students pay off their loans
to family and friends, not to banks or con-
glomerates.

When it comes time for repayment,
students send the money to GreenNote,
which repays the lender.

GreenNote/carries a ﬁxed interest of
6.8 percent for most of the nation and 6
percent in Pennsylvania and Washington,
D.C. These areas are exceptional because
they have a maximum rate on consumer
loans. Other lenders typically range from
8.5 percent to 20 peicent. _ . ,

GreenNote makes its proﬁt by collect-
ing a documentation fee of 2 percent from
the student during his pledge drive, or the
time when the student is requesting money
from the social network.

GreenNote also receives a management
fee of 1 percent from each loan payment,
and this comes out of the pocket of the
lender. According to GreenNote’s Web site,
there are no additional hidden charges.

“These small fees mean that most of

' the money raised goes toward the student,”

said Agarwal. “Our fees are transparent in

comparison to those of alternative ‘lend-
ers.”

At state schools, the gap between the
price of tuition and the average federal
loan is about $33,000. Besides federal loans,
students can ﬁll their ﬁnancial disparity in
paying for higher education by getting al-
ternative loans from private companies,

‘according to the Web site FinAid.org, a

public service guide to students’ ﬁnancial
aid. Nationwide, the number of students
applying for alternative loans is on the rise.

Families typically turn: to ‘alternative-

loans when federal loans provide‘ too little
money or when they need more ﬂexible
payment options. 0 ' ' '
Major providers of private loans in-
clude Sallie Mae, PNC_ Bank, MyRichUn-
cle.com and Wells Fargo, FinAid.org said.
Top lenders, such as America Corp and

Citigroup,» have slowed alternative lending.

by giving out fewer loans to students, and
the government has reduced the subsidies
provided to lenders. 0

GreenNote was co-founded in 2007'

by Agarwal, a Harvard-educated business
management executive with experience at
companies such as Oracle and Hewlett-
Packard, and Ben Sharma, who gained
experience operating Web content while
working on Speedera‘ Networks. Today,
they are the company’s CEO and chief
technology ofﬁcer, respectively.

Year-round exposure to particle pol-
lution can cause asthma complications,
damage to the lungs and increased risk of
death from lung cancer and cardiovascular
disease, said Nolen.
“Residents in the Pittsburgh area should
be very concerned,” said Schaeffer.
Schaeffer estimates that 30 to 35 per-

cent of Pittsburgh’s ﬁne particle pollution
comes from coal—ﬁred power plants. The
hundreds of companies, schools, hospi-

part of Pittsburgh’s ﬁne particle pollution
problem. _

Scientists,

meet 'AliCe'

A by Christine Black
For T be Pitt New

Sophomore engineering student Jamie
Richardson used to believe that computer
science was ajob restricted to the conﬁnes
of a customer service counter. _

“My initial picture of a computer sci-
ence person was someone just sitting behind
a desk and answering help desk questions,”
said Richardson.

After taking a course in intermediate Java,
however, Richardson’s opinions about the
ﬁeld changed.

Worries over nerdy classmates and dull
material were ushered out of -the picture with
the introduction of a programming instruc-
tional tool called “Alice.”

The difficulty of computer science cours-

es created a need for Alice. The program

makes learning the fundamentals of pro-
gramming easier for students by generating
easily modiﬁed animations. Java and other
commercially used languages are often diffi-
cult for new learners to understand, but__ Alice
helps translate.

W/ith Alice, students can visualize all of
their efforts in coding right on their computer
screens. Three dimensional objects and char-
acters that students can work with‘ include
graphics from ancient Egypt, an amusement
park, a city or a fairyland, among others.

Created by the late Carnegie Mellon pro-
fessor and widely known presenter of “The
Last Lecture” Randy Pausch, Alice was intro-
duced partly in response to a decline in fresh-
men computer science majors nationwide.

decade also inspired the software.

One Pitt professor who uses Alice in
his classes regularly, Daniel Mosse, said that
“the computer science department is 
to target all students” by integrating a more
user—friendly teaching tool. -

“The problem with a stigma in computer
science, or any ﬁeld, is that it attracts a large
populadon of a certain type, rather than
diversifying the population. I believe that
everyone is capable of understanding com-
puter science, and I believe it’s a mattervof

ful drag—and—drop editor to alter commands,
Alice was made for the masses.

Asirn Jamshed, a graduate teaching assis-
tant currently using Alice to teach students
introductory level programming, thinks that
the tool is “easy for students  because they
can see the results of whatever they’re cod-
ing through animation.”

jamshed has taught many computer sci—_

ence classes and sees how Alice is working.
“In the previous semesters, we used
Java programming language and the stu-
dents were not really interested in the mate-
rial. They thought, why are we learning this?
Now they are seeing animations and using

 

   
   

objects to get more out of the material,” said
Jamshed. «

Pitt student Frank Baranyai has used Al-
ice in seven of his classes within the depart-
ment. A pupil of Jamshed, Baranyai learned

programming techniques prior to starting at .

Pitt this year, but refuses. to believe that com-
puter science is a nerdy field.

“It depends how you look at it and who
you are. I think we’re always going to need
computer science in the future  and it’s not
that nerdy,” said Baranyai.

Students and those interested in basic
computer programming can download Alice

to broaden their skills at home or at work.

smoked hookah, a number on par with those
who had smoked cigarettes, said Primack.

Roughly 50 percent of respondents said
that they considered smoking hookah to be
less addictive than smoking cigarettes, a per-
ception that the study suggested might be
linked to the use of hookah by those who
don’t smoke cigarettes.

“[1-Iookah] is reaching a new group‘ of
people who may face addiction later in life,”
said Primack.

But the data on the health effects of hoo-
kah smoking a.nd on its prevalence is not en-
tirely ﬁrm, Primack said. He said that it will
be important to do two  in the future to
better understand hookah use: Look at hoo-
kah smoking on other university campuses
and do more qualitative work.

‘We really need to get more people’s in-

. put,” said Primack.

But, as the study revealed, many hookah
smokers are not as concerned as Primack
about the impact of smoking on their health.

Freshman Dan Murray, who recently
bought a hookah, said that he is not worried.
“I’ve done a lot of research on hookah, and I
think it’siultta puriﬁed,” said Murray

However, Primack cautions that such re-
search can give people a false sense of security.
He echoed the warnings of many Pitt profes-
sors, saying that just because a Google search
turns up sources doesn’t mean they’re correct.

“Information is such a tricky thing these
days,” said Primack

Even though hookah is a subject of re-
search for some smokers and professors, for
others it’s a part of their college experience at
Pitt. ,

pect,” said sophomore Adam Niederle.

Niederle sat with five of his friends just a
few tables away from McCune smoking or-
ange crush and vanilla flavored tobacco from
a recently repaired hookah. -

Although he smokes hookah twice a night
on average, it’s not because it’s addictive, he
said, but rather because it’s a social experi-
ence.

“[Smoking hookah] is how we’ve been

meeting kids. I don’t know most of Tower C,‘

but I know a lot of kids in other Towers be-

“It’s deﬁnitely 100 times cooler than it
was last year,” said Lynn Sudik, a sopho-

 

more who lived without air conditioning as
a freshman and is braving the heat again this
year.

Sudik said that the weather this year has
had its cooler days and its warmer days, but
overall, her dorm room has been cooler.

She credited this change to new fans in
her residence hall, Lothrop Hall,, but also to
the weather, which has been cooler. “This
week in particular, I’ve been keeping my
window closed because it’s been cold,” said
Sudik.

She is not the only one who noticed fall’s
early arrival.

Lee Hendricks, a meteorologist from the
National Weather Service in Pittsburgh, said
that he would describe this summer to be
“incredibly mild, not extremely cold or ex-
tremely warm.”

It has been slightly cooler than

normal, but not significantly.

The meteorologist said that August and
September are normally the hottest months,
but this year, the trends have changed.

\X/hile ]uly’s average temperatures were
“dead on,” the temperature of the hottest
day in August was only 89 degrees on Aug.
24, cooler than the other summer months,
said Hendricks.

In June, there were three days higher than
90 degrees, but since then, temperatures have
stayed relatively cool, said Hendricks.

The National Weather Service said that
summers average about 8.4 days that reach
more than 90 degrees. This summer, we have
only had three of those 90—degree days.

In 2007, the average temperature for
August was recorded at 74 degrees, but this
year’s August average was only 69.7 degrees.

“It has been slightly cooler than normal,
” said Hendricks, “but not signiﬁcantly.”

He contributes the lower temperatures to
normal weather fluctuations and agreed that
fall might be coming early this year.

policy, Pitt took a huge step in
the right direction. The Univer-
sity will soon add “gender iden-
tity and expression” to the list
of protected items.

Currently, University policy
prohibits discrimination based
on race or color, religion, na-
tionality, sex, age, marital or
familial status, disability, sexual
orientation and veteran status.

The change will protect stu-
dents against discrimination for
expressing their gender iden-
tity.

This means that whether
students View or present them-
selves as male or female, their
rights would not be impaired.
Pitt’s Rainbow Alliance, a stu-
dent group advocating gay,
lesbian, transgender and queer
concerns, had been pushing for
the change for two years.

The group’s vice president,
Kelly Coburn, told The Pitt
News, “It seems to me that Pitt
is very willing to make impor-
tant changes once it’s pointed
out they’re important  I think
most students won’t even no-
tice the change, but my hope
is that a lot of students will be
impacted by it.”

Coburn said that the change
can affect any student, but will,
above all, apply to the lesbian,
gay, bisexual, transgender and
queer community.

Based upon the University’s
actions, it is clear that the cul-
ture of fear surrounding equal
rights to the LGBTQA com-
munity is gradually diminishing.

“It is a policy change that had
been made during the summer,
building on a recommendation
that had come from the Student
Government Board last year,”
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
told The Pitt News.

We applaud the University

for its decision. Acknowledging
and protecting the rights of ev-
ery student makes Pitt a much
more open and accepting uni-
versity.

However, there's still the
small possibility that the policy
inclusion might not become an
official reality when presented
to Pitt's Board of Trustees.

While Chancellor Norden—
berg conﬁrmed the change and
was enthusiastic in speaking
about it, he also said he didn’t
think it had been passed for-
mally.

Other Pitt ofﬁcials have not
confirmed the change. In fact,
many University ofﬁcials were
not aware of the change.

University spokesman John
Fedele said talk of the change
was “bad information.”

Whether this is miscommu-
nication or disorganization is
unclear.

But, either way, University
ofﬁcials should make it one
of their priorities to come to a

_complete, official decision on

the matter —— maybe even as
soon as when the Trustees con-
vene in October.

Inconsistency of thought
and information between Pitt
ofﬁcials makes it seem as though
Pitt is not serious about imple-
menting this change quickly.

As a result, it is difficult to
say, at this point, when the pol-
icy will formally include the ad-
dition.

We hope that Pitt officials
will end any rniscommunication
or disorganization and start act-
ing on the same page, especially
where students’ rights are con-
cerned.

Only then can the University
officially send the message that
discrimination will not be toler-
ated and that all students, fac-
ulty and staff will receive equal

treatment 011 campus.

Understanding both sides of the gun control debate

by Giles Howard

C'olum/ziot

 

I’ve never been well acquainted
with this nation’s gun culture. Like
all Americans, I’m familiar with
the Second Amendment, and I’ve
studied it as a history major, but
it’s never been a personal issue for
me. I

For me, it’s always been an an-
cillary political issue that I really
only think about during election
years or when a tragedy occurs
and the news is swamped with the

reactions of both pro— and anti- '

gun pundits. _ . _
Up ‘until last month, I hadn’t_
even ﬁred a gun before.

”‘ That changed ltrwﬁeartiwen-n-o?‘
a shooting range at the Wexford V

State Game Lands with two mem-

bers of Pitt’s Student’s for Con-
cealed Carry on Campus.
This in my mind,
~ stripped away all of the rhetoric,
controversy and political postur-
ing associated with gun owner-
, ship. ’

event,

The people around me at the _

shooting range were responsible
men and women, owning guns for
personal protection, hunting or

recreation. They exuded an enthu— .

siasm for their hobby similar to
_the enthusiasm any golfer would
display at the driving range on a
weekend afternoon. .

.But unlike golfers, these people i

and their hobby are at the center

of a national debate in this coun—.i
 j try; a debate that _ignores»the.moti~ .
vations of t'h‘e‘peopl’e *that'I“met at "

the range last month and instead
focuses on extremes.

Extreme rhetoric such as for-
mer president of the National Ri-
ﬂe Association Charlton Heston’s
famous exclamation at the 2000
NRA convention that a potential.

Al Gore presidency would take .

away his gun rights “from 

cold, dead hands” does nothing.

to ‘advance the debate over gun
control._ Instead, it "makes it easier
for opponents of gun ownership
to stereotype the other side as
a collection of militia members
chomping at the bit to get their

hands on the newest, most dc-I

structive ‘military hardware.

I know that when I used to
support strict gun control, I did so
with the belief that guns were/only
meant to people andithat-those

you don’t want’: to be accused~of
being a sexist bigot. “Ybu knoziz/you
can put lnzstiek on apzg, but its still a
pig, ” said Obama of MeCain spolieies.

7. “experience” n. —— at least
one day in public office. This trait
is highly prized in the political

world and is thus a great compli-

ment. “[Palin] bas executive eaqterienee
and a real record of aeeomplisbmenzg”
said McCain of bis running mate.

8. “America” n. — the great-
est place in the world. Politicians

_use this word as much as .possible,
. and it is often used to imply a bi!

partisan voting base. Frequent use
of this word is a great way to lure
in independents. ‘Tberes not a liberal

America and a conservative America —
tberes tbe United States of America, ”
said Obama. _
9. ‘‘\Washington’’ n. —a place of
evil and corruption; adj. describing
those associated with Washington;
corrupt; evil. This word achieves a
greater effect when spoken in a low
hiss. Politicians seek to avoid asso-
ciation with this term at all cost.
‘z‘4nd let me oﬂer an advanee warning

10. “small towns in Pennsyl-

gun—loving folk. One step above

towns in Pennsylvania, and like .a lot of
small towns in tbe ll/Iidzvest; tbe jobs bave

, tben tbgjr get bitter; tbgr cling to guns or '

religion or antzpatby to people zv/Jo aren’t
like tbem . . ., ” said Obama.

11. “very, very healthy” adj. —
endangered.‘ “We are suing t/Jeﬁvderal

gered Speties Art is not a plate to kinda

. 12. “Moll}f’ n. —— the greatest

There was nothing antiquated
about the attitudes of the gun
owners ‘at that shooting range in
Wexford. Instead, the attitude of
today’s gun owner strikes me as
more realistic than that of anygun
control advocates.

Think about it, the idea be-
hind gun control is that making
it harder to legally purchase a gun
and banning the sale of certain
weapons entirely will reduce 

violence in this country. It is ideal— P
I istic rather than realistic because it A

assumes that eventually the more
than 250 million privately owned
firearms in this nation will disap-
pear. ' j» I ,
‘ Time, it appears, has been on
the side of  owners in this
country. A ‘
There are more states with
right—to-carry laws today‘ than at

any other time in our history, and
rates of gun ownership have been
increasing annually as well. Such
statistics [would have only unset-
tled me in years past, but now that
I have faces to attach to gun own-
ership, such facts are much easier
to accept. V

Don’t get me wrong, I still have

some mixed feelings about the,

availability of guns in this country.
Ithink that they’re too easy to buy
and that the licensing process for
concealed carry should be more
rigorous.

However, understanding both

‘sides of the issue better now than

I did before, I am much more
comfortable with gun ownership
in general and with concealed car-
ry on this campus in particular.

thatthey would like to’ wear.” ‘

Pace’s own line features mostly dresses
and has been inspired by her background
in musical theater, “Everything is cos-
tume-y. Everything is girly, but funky and
edgy.” Pace also draws inspiration -fromthe
“edginess of rock ’n"roll and the dramaof
anything Tim Burton does.” As a second-
year participant, Pace said, “Last year I just

wanted to get my name out there asia de-

signer. I’ve owned a clothing store for four
years now, and over the last two years my

.mother and Istarted making clothes, so I

just_thought itiwould be a fun way to get
my name ‘and my clothing line’s name out
there.” ' A

I Her clothing, which you can find exclu-
sively at Bombshell Boutique in Sewickley
by appointment only, has been featured in
about 20 fashion shows in the Pittsburgh
area. W/hile Pace is relatively -established,
Pitt Lstudent Ciara Simon is just starting

‘ out.‘ Her line, Kitchie,-is made up entirely
F" of aprons. ’

“Right_now this is -a brand new line.
It hasn’t even gone into production yet,”

i said Simon. “I’m waiting to see people’_s

responses from the show  If I could sell
it in boutiques in Pittsburgh, that would be

amazing.”

Simon is participating for the ﬁrsttime

in this year’s Local Motion show. “I think

for Pittsburgh, it’s something totally dif-
ferent,” she said. “I think it allows people
with not a lot of design experience to show
their pieces to Pittsburgh.” _ V

5Simon’s inspiration for this line came

from her personal experience. "I come
from a family where there’s a lot of enter-
taining and cooking. A couple years ago,
I needed an apron and the one we had
was just a drab piece of canvas,'so I went
searching for pretty vintage ones.” , I
But then she _realized she could create
them herself. Inspired by the 19505, she
said her line is‘ ‘;‘a little more modern, but
aprons in general are a thing of the past.”
However, don’t expect her lineup of 12
aprons in Thursday’s show to be anything

but young and fun. “I hope it has a lot of

energy,” said Simon of the show. '

She cites her time spent this summer
taking classes at Parsons The New School
for Design in New York City as ‘the event
that jump-started her to finally” create her
own line.‘ “There’s so much inspiration. I
got the majority of my fabric while I was
there.” - V _ ‘

' This December, Simon will be graduat-

, ing from Pitt with a degree in exercise sci-

ence, but she feels that her future plans are

still up in the air. “Because graduation was _
around the corner, I decided to give some-

  

thing else a try,” she said.’ _  _j

help to expose ﬂedgling designers to the Pittsburgh
scene — it also beneﬁts local charities. This year, the
beneﬁciary is Family Services of Western Pennsylva-
nia’s Educational Assistance Program, which provides
secondary education resources for youth.

Vreck elaborates on the inspiration for the event,
‘A‘It started _out as City Paper wanting to do a local
beneﬁt. We try to keep the money in Pittsburgh
rather than going with a national charity.” The show
will be ‘held at the James Centre for the first time, an
old schoolhouse in Pittsburgh’s West End. “This is
the first year we’re having an auction,” added Yreck.
“It’s something additional we’re doing for the char-
ity.” Pace, who considers the area to have a lot of
undiscovered talent, said, “A lot of people would
be surprised. Not too many people know about the
Pittsburgh fashion scene.” M

Simon, however, feels it’s lacking. “I think it’s wait-
ing to be tapped, I hope,” she said. “At least in my
experience with Pittsburgh people, they’re a little less
‘open to new ideas, especially-when I came from being
in New York for a month. In New York you can wear
whatever, in Pittsburgh you get funny looks.”

   

Collection: Thursday's Local Motion fashion show features the designs of-local art-

Dr. House returns for
season five, still cranky

Courtesy FOX

The curmudgeonly Dr. House (Hugh Laurie) shows that he has a heart after all. Season
five of the award-winning drama premieres tonight on FOX.

by Larissa Gula
Staff WrL'ter

“House”

Starring: Hugh Laurie, Robert Sean Leonard, Lisa
Edelstein
Season Premiere tonight at 8 on FOX

    
   

W  Tonight marks the return
i\‘‘' of one of TV’s most sarcastic
an  and rude characters created
/' to date — the one who’s ap-
L parently never ﬁred from his
job because, as his boss puts it‘, “The son-of-
a—bitch is the best doctor we have.” Dr. Greg
House (Hugh Laurie) returns for his ﬁfth sea-
son on FOX, and missing the premiere is not
recommended.

“House” is a medical show that combines
the best of the best. In each episode, a pa-
tient is wheeled into the ﬁctional Princeton-
Plainsboro Teaching Hospital with an array
of symptoms that could belong to multiple
diseases. A group of young doctors, under
supervision of a man who happens to be a
prescription painkiller addict, must combat
the disease with an arsenal of tests and treat-
ments. '

The patient is almost always cured in the
end —— but don’t worry, the plotline is excit-
ing, albeit predictable. The writers deliber-
ately make up for this repetition by creating
character conflicts relevant to controversial
social debates.

The new season of “House” is complete
with both old and new characters and will
pick up two months after last season’s shock-

ing ﬁnale. Previously, one of the hospital’s
doctors was killed by an unlucky series of
events, leaving the people who knew her to
deal with her death.

House’s best friend and doctor sidekick
_]ames Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) in par-
ticular suffers, as the deceased was his girl-
friend. He struggles not only with dealing
with her death, but coming to terms with the
role that House played. His method to deal
with her passing leaves House, top boss Lisa
Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) and most of Wilson’s
associates stunned.

Of course, as the doctors continue to
deal with relationship drama, a hardworking
feminist is wheeled into the hospital with hal-
lucinations. What was thought to be a B12
deﬁciency turns into the typical string of
symptoms and health problems stemming
from one unknown cause.

\While waiting for a diagnosis, viewers can
witness a controversial gender focus — just
where does a hard—working woman ﬁt into
society? Can she truly be anything, or can she
merely aspire? Even the language turnsicon-
troversial in parts (thanks, House).

House’s previous apprentices all remain
in the hospital, playing their roles in each
episode as moremature doctors who have

' learned from the sarcastic House. One of

them ﬁnds that her reactions to patients are
constantly altered by the fact that she has
Huntingtorfs disease and will, in fact, die her-
self  l2 years.

Despite that, the newcomers are stepping
up to take over the small roles that House’s
original team left empty. This season should
show if they are able to grow into their ﬁelds
as much as the other doctors.

Sign Ups will be Wednesday, September 17, 2008 at 10am in

Struggles Continue

for volleyball in L.A.

by Randy Lieberman
Staff Wrder

The Pitt women’s volleyball
team’s struggles continued this
weekend in Los Angeles, Calif.

The Panthers (3-8) did not win
a single set during the Sheraton

,,Four Points LAX/ Loyola Mary-
mount University Volleyball
Classic, losing 3-0 to host Loyola
Marymount, UC Irvine and San
Jose State.

“There’s no doubt it’s frus-
trating, [but] we were up against
very good competition,” said
head coach Toby Rens of the
three tournament losses. “Loy-
ola Marymount and UC Irvine
will most likely be in the NCAA

:aeTournament this year. Our big-
gest challenge remains that we
are implementing new things and
playing a different style than what
we’ve been playing in the past.
We’re trying to do that under the
pressure of a match situation.”

Rens said that a five-hour ﬂight
the day before the match, coupled
with the most difficult schedule
of the four tournament teams,
took a toll on the Panthers.

Pitt will look to end its five-
match losing streak tonight at 7
at Robert Morris, then again this
weekend in the annual Pitt Clas-
sic, hosted at the Fitzgerald Field
House. Pitt hosts VCU, Gonzaga
and Eastern Michigan with the
games starting at 10:30 a.m. on
Friday.

‘We have the ability to play
much faster than Robert Morris
offensively. Our game-plan is go-
ing to be to play fast and push the
tempo of the match,” said Rens.
“As far as the tournament, the
field is very competitive. All three
of teams are off to decent starts.
VCU in particular has some pret-
ty talented kids that are very ath-
letic.”

Rens did take some positives

out of the three losses in last
weekend’s tournament.

“Senior jessica Moses played
very consistently throughout the
-weekend, and Nicole Tourence
set a great match against UC Ir-
vine. She was sort of like the
quarterback for our team,” said
Rens. “Megan Dooley moved
over to a right side hitter from
middle blocker and had some
great highlights.”

Sophomore Amy Town re-
corded 10 kills in the first match
against Loyola Marymount on
Saturday, which the Panthers lost
in three sets, 18-25, 13-25 and 19-
25.

Town led the Panthers with 10
kills, eight digs and a .269 hitting
percentage. e

The Panthers gave LMU 24
points in the match on attack er-
rors.

Senior Kelly Campbell ﬁn-
ished with eight kills and five digs

fantasy lesson No. 2: buying high and selling low

by Tony Ferraiolo
Se/zior Staff W/rite/'

   

There is no better time than early in the
"season to shake up your fantasy football
roster.

The first few weeks are the optimal
time to maximize the value of players off
to a fast start and, adversely, dump guys
that have uncharacteristically jumped out
"to blazing starts.

Do your best Scott Boras impression.
Try to trick the managers in your league
and:

Sell Ben Roethlisberger —— The Steel-

0 ers are 2-0. That’s all the matters to them.
Roethlisberger is a highly efficient 25 of 33
on the season (75 percent). That’s, perhaps,

all that matters to him. But it has nothing
to do with what matters to me. For Roeth-
lisberger owners, it’s painstaking to‘ watch
the Steelers offense. Run on ﬁrst down,
run on second down, run on third down
and kick on fourth down.

The most frustrating thing about watch-
ing Big Ben and the Steelers offense oper-
ate is that it seems blatantly obvious that
if they wanted to, the Steelers could open
up their offense and throw all over teams.
Yet Big Ben has not attempted 20 passes in
either of the Steelers’ first two games. A

Sell Big Ben high before it’s too late. He
had 32 touchdown passes last year. An in-
credible total for anyone not named Brady,
Manning or Romo. After the aforemen-
tioned three, Roethlisberger seemed to be
the guy to draft.

Then it happened.

\Willie Parker scored more touchdowns
in one game (three) than he did all last sea-
son. So far Pittsburgh has run the ball 70
times and thrown it just 37. That’s not a
quarterback-friendly distribution rate. If
the first two games are any indication of
the Steelers’ offensive game plan for the
year, Roethlisberger won’t do enough _sta-
tistically to carry your fantasy team.

Remember when Rothlisberger’s 9-for-
21, 123-yard, no—touchdown, two-inter-
ception performance was good enough to
win the Super Bowl?

‘ Managing an offense can win football
games but not fantasy matchups. Not to
mention the likes of Jason Campbell, Trent
Edwards and ].T. O’SulliVan all scored
more points than Big Ben through the first

two weeks and are probably available on
the waiver wire.

Oh yeah, and then there’s that separated
shoulder thing. 0

Sell Matt Hasselbeck — It might be
too late, but if he still holds value in your
league, dish him off. Hasselbeck is headed
for a disastrous season. In the preseason,
his own brother, Tim, said that Hasselbeck
would not have a good fantasy year. Looks
like he got it right.

So far Hasselbeck has completed just 45
percent of his passes with just one touch-
down and three interceptions.

' Hasselbeck hasn’t eclipsed 200 yards
passing in either of his ﬁrst two games
against two defenses (Buffalo and San
Francisco) that gave up more than 240

Pitt men stay hot, earn best start since '

by Sergei Feldman
Staﬂ U7/‘iter

Pitt 2, Bryant 1

Neither Bryant University nor
the pouring rain could steer the
Pitt men’s soccer team from what
turned into a 2-1 Victory Friday
evening atthe swamp-like Found-
ers Field, as the Panthers struck
in overtime to jump off to their
best start since 2002.

The contest was part of the
second annual Pitt Invitational
and was the ﬁrst of two sched-
uled matches for Pitt, which irn-
proved its record to 3-1-1 on the
year.

In its first season of Division
I play, Bryant University survived
many Pitt chances before ulti-
mately falling prey to a persistent
Panthers club.

Pitt coach Joe Luxbacher ex-
pressed mixed emotions about
the team’s performance.

“We played well and had a
lot of opportunities. But we just
missed a lot of good chances,”
said Luxbacher.

Sophomore midﬁelder Joe
Prince-Wright, however, would
not miss his. The England native
capitalized for his second career
goal to deliver the game-winning
tally after receiving a gorgeous
cross-feed from senior forward

 McCormick.

Almost as impressive as the
goal was the celebration that fol-
lowed by a jovial Prince-Wright,
as he removed his jersey and slid
into and across a muddy ﬁeld be-
fore ﬁnally being joined by team-
mates.

Pitt played like the more com-
fortable team, controlling play
from the outset.

Freshman forward Wils Alp-
ern registered his ﬁrst career goal
in the game’s 38th minute after
receiving a pass from junior mid-
ﬁelder Matt Baker and shot the
ball past Bryant’s goalkeeper.

Bryant’s Ben Mello showed
his ﬂare for the dramatic, knock-

Left: Senior defenseman and midﬁelder Eric Jaeger  controls the ball.
Right: Sophomore midﬁelder Justin Boehm (14)

bacher.

The same could not be said
for the offense, however.

“We’ve got to ﬁnd guys who’1l
put the ball in and score some
goals. We haven’t really been do-
ing that. That’s where we have to
improve,” said Luxbacher. \

Originally scheduled to play at
Founders Field, weather condi-
tions reared their ugly head yet
again, forcing the logistical shift

, to Rl\/fU’s Moon Township cam-

pus.
Pitt, however, would not make
any excuses.
“The weather was a factor for

everyone. Actually, the wind was
worse than the rain. It really af-
fected the throw-ins and especial-
ly the play for the goalies,” said
Luxbacher.

Much of the game’s excite-
ment came from the Western
Michigan bench area, as its head
and assistant coaches did not
shy away from exchanging sport
pleasantries with the ofﬁciating
crew regarding a few allegedly
questionable calls.

For their behavior, both
coaches were rewarded with yel-
low cards.

While Western Michigan’s

coaches argued calls, the Pitt play-
ers focused on coming away vic-
torious. In the 41st minute of the
first half, sophomore midﬁelder
Ian Farnsworth almost scored the
game’s first goal, as he hit a lethal
strike off the crossbar.

The suffocating Pitt defense
prevented its opponent from
creating any chances, essentially
tilting the ﬁeld in the direction
of the Western Michigan goal. At
one point, Pitt outshot Western
Michigan 12-0 before ﬁnishing
14-3. In fact, it took just more
than 70 minutes for WMU to reg-
ister a shot, which was beautifully

ing in an 88“‘—minute goal to tie
the game at 1-1 and send it into
overtime.

Disappointed but not de-
ﬂated, Pitt approached overtime
with a tangible fervor, getting
chances from both McCormick
and Baker before ﬁnally register-
ing the game-winner off Prince-
Wright’s foot.

Pitt controlled play through-
out the game, outshooting Bryant
23-11 and earning nine corner
kicks to Bryant’s four.

The victory matches Pitt’s to-
tal from all of last season.

Pitt 1, Western Michigan 0

snagged by goaltender Jordan
Marks, who earned his second
shutout of the year.

Early in the second overtime
period, junior forward Chris Wil-
cox hit a blistering shot to the

upper left-hand corner for the

game-ending goal after catch-
ing sophomore midﬁelder Justin
Boehm’s throw-in.

The goal earned Pitt the tour-
nament title, as the Panthers went
an undefeated 2-0-0. Robert

Morris ﬁnished 1-0-1 for second’

place. Bryant came in third with
a 0-1-1 record, while Western
Michigan ﬁnished in fourth, go-

Heading into its ﬁnal match
of the Pitt Invitational, the resil-
ient Pitt men’s soccer team im-
proved to a 4-1-1 record with a
1-0 double-overtime victory over
Western Michigan Sunday after:
noon at Robert Morris’ North
Atlantic Complex.

Luxbacher said he was not sur-
prised with how far the team has
come along in the young season
but also won’t take it for granted.

“We expected to be good this

season. Sure, the four wins are

good, but the focus was playing
solid defense, which we’ve been
able to do. We have room to im-
prove, but we’re definitely happg
with where we are,” said Lux-

ing 0-2-0.

Pitt’s Connor Malone, 

Kalas, Eric Jaeger and Chris Wil-
cox snagged All-Tournament
Team honors.

Though it was no doubt a
successful weekend and start
to the year, the Panthers must
keep things in proper perspec-
tive as they begin their toughest
challenge yet, embarking on the
demanding Big—East Conference
p1ay- . ,
“We’re happy with the win, but
we can’t look too far ahead. Ev-
ery game in the Big East will be a
huge battle,” said Luxbacher.

Pittsburgh quarterback Ben Roethlisberger is hit in Sunday night's game against the
Cleveland Browns. This season, Pittsburgh has run the ball 70 times and thrown just 57.

yards passing per game last year.

Like Roethlisberger, Hasselbeck has an
injury (bulging disk) that nobody seems
to know much about. To combat that, Se-
attle is playing without its three best wide
receivers for at least another three weeks.
Hasselbeck had a ﬁne year last season. Per-
haps you can ﬁnd somebody who believes
Hasselbeck’s slow start is an enigma. If you
can, exploit that manager. It doesn’t look
good for Hasselbeck.

Sell Lendale White —— White owners
should be thrilled that they have gotten a
touchdown out of White in each of the
ﬁrst two games because now he has some
value that really isn’t there. Yes, White
rushed for more than 1,000 yards and
scored seven touchdowns last year, but he
didn’t have Chris Johnson to worry about.
Johnson, a rookie from East Carolina, ran
a 4.24 40-yard dash at the NFL scouting
combine, which tied the record for the fast-
est time ever recorded at the combine in
Indianapolis.

White might, and I stress the might,
still get goal—line carries for Tennessee, but
even that won’t be enough for him to re-
main a formidable option at running back.
Johnson already has games of 93 and 109
yards. With Vince Young out indeﬁnitely,
it’s going to be hard for Tennessee to keep
Johnson’s explosiveness off the ﬁeld. It’s
hard to imagine that White will have any
legitimate fantasy worth by the end of the
year.

Buy Maurice Jones-Drew —— Perhaps
only Tom Brady owners have second-
guessed themselves more. Jones-Drew
was typically drafted in the second or third
round in fantasy drafts. When he’s actu-
ally gotten and opportunity so far, Jones-
Drew has looked awful carrying the ball.
Through two games, he has just 12 carries
for 30 yards. However, Jones-Drew has al-
ready scored a touchdown, something he
hadn’t done in the ﬁrst three games of the
last two seasons.

There are deterrents. Jacksonville’s of-

Issac Bruce, 57, could

be a steal in your league J

Fantasy, page 16

fensive line has been decimated by injuries,
and as a team the Jaguars are averaging a
pathetic 65.5 yards rushing pergame this
year. That could be a major concern ‘since
Jones-Drew has to -split touches with Fred
Taylor. But Jones-Drew has big play poten-
tial, and if Jacksonville can’t get its inter-
mediate running game going, it _will have to
put Jones-Drew and his big play potential
on the ﬁeld as much as possible. It might
take a couple weeks, but expectJones-Drew
to see more and more touches. Strike now
while Jones-Drew owners are still mulling
over selecting him early in the draft.

, Buy Anthony Gonzalez -— I highlight-

ed Gonzalez as a preseason sleeper a few-

weeks ago, and I’m sticking with him. With
the absence of Dallas Clark, Gonzalez took
over as the Colts focal point from the slot,
catching nine balls for 137 yards. Although

Clark’s knee injury isn’t being viewed as se—..

rious, his absence Sunday gave Gonzalez
the opportunity to showcase his ability.

Gonzalez won’t score a ton of touch-.

downs this year, but, especially in leagues
that count receptions, his value is good
enough to be your third wide receiver or
your wr/rb ﬂex.

Buy Roy Williams —- It doesn’t look

L

‘ had under the tutelage of Martz at the turn

like there’s much doubt that Calvin John-
son has emerged as Jon Kitna’s go-to guy in
Detroit. Not to mention the Lions drafted

Johnson second overall andzgave him $27,

million guaranteed, so they have no choice

but to throw him the ball. However, Wil— J
liams (6-foot-2, 220 pounds) is unbeliev-

ably gifted athletically, and he’s also in his

ever-enticing contract year. You can’t ig— '

note the fact that Detroit "fell behind big in
both of its first two games and was forced
to‘. throw the ball for the majority.

Even with Johnson as the guy in De-
troit, there  bemore than enoughballs

_ to go around. \Williams, who is averaging
‘ three catches and just 47.5 yards after the

ﬁrst two weeks, should be relatively cheap.

_ Buy Isaac Bruce — That’s right, buy
the soon to be 37-year-old that didn’t catch
a single pass in San Francisco’s opener.
Mike Martz is calling the plays in San
Francisco, and who could forget the majes-
tic passing game that St. Louis and Bruce

of the century. After being shutout in week
one, Bruce caught four passes for 153 yards
in San Francisco’s week two  over Seat-
tle. J.T. O’Sull.ivan looked formidable, and,
for lack of a better option, Bruce could see
enough balls to garner consideration.

in the match.

I Freshmen Hannah Swysgood and Ally-
son Hodnik both played critical roles in the
Pitt attack.

Swysgood, who redshirted last year and
- is starting for the first time this season, had

a career-high three block assists in the third
set for Pitt. Hodnik set 13 of the Panthers’
28 kills. _

Despite getting nine kills each from
Campbell and Dooley in the second match,

Pitt fell in three sets to UC Irvine by the
J scores of 20-25, 16-25 and 24-26.

Following a timeout  the final set with
the Panthers trailing by four, Campbell
notched two kills and a block with Moses
to cut the deﬁcit to one point.

’ Moses then blocked a UC Irvine attack I

with senior Nicole Taurence to tie the set
at 18 points. A

. After even play, Swysgood gave Pitt a
24-23 lead with a kill, but UC Irvine called
a timeout, knotted the set with a kill and
eventually won on two blocks of Panther
attacks.

Pitt dropped its ﬁnal game of the tour-
nament against San Jose State by the scores
of 19-25, 18-25 and 21-25.

Campbell paced the Panthers with 10
kills and eight digs, while Town added sev-
en kills and two blocks in the match.

Rens acknowledged the losses, but said
he told his team they have not played a Big
East opponent. ,

‘ “Even though we’ve lost some games,
I told the players it’s the conference games
that we really need to focus on,” said Rens.
“I wanted them to recognize that we haven’t
