GUESTS AT yesterday's reception (Chancellor Wesley Posvar in-
included) crowd around one of the punch-tables.

Reception  
Introduces

Chancellor

Here's the way it lined up for
the big event yesterday on the

"‘Heinz -Chapel Mall.” William

Rea, chairman of the Board of
Trustees, ran interference wi-th
his Wife next to him formoral
support, and Chancellor Wesley
Posvar, accompanied ‘by his at-
tractive wife, stood ready to de-
liver the ﬁnal blow.

The event wasn't a Kennedy-
style football game ‘but a -giant
reception thrown by the trus-
tees to introduce _the new chan-

‘ cellor to the community. The foe
’ consisted of almost 2,000 guests
.who lined up to shake hands

with the Reas and Posvars. In-
ciuded on the -guest. list were
many community leaders, indus-
trial’ executives, alumni, and
University administration and
faculty.

’ Allmost 4,600 invitations were
sent out for the affair, most of
them to couples. Though every-
one did not accept, enough peo-
ple came that the reception last-
ed a -half hour more than the

' alloted two hours.

the people at the reception didn’t

Engineering Dean Elaborates

by ANN DORN

Dean Harold E. Hoelscher
of the School of Engineering
discussed the new Engineer-
ing program of studies at a
Pitt News interview yester-
day. The change; involves a
common study program for
the ﬁrst four terms and a
selected ﬁeld of concentra-
tion chosen in the sophomore
year for the remaining terms. “I
hope the students ﬁnd the pro-
gram to be acceptable,” stated
Dean Hoelscher. “It is a signi-
ficant improvement for all stu-
dents.”

Dean Hoelscher noted that
“there is a deep involvement of
the faculty in this project.” He
also emphasized that there has
been a “signiﬁcant input from a

- variety ofother Pehple. “We've

been helped by Dean Kehl, Dean
Wadsworth, Dean Kline -and As-
sociate Dean Evert, who are sup-
portive of this program.”

Dean Hoelscher explained what
led to the change in program:

DEAN HAROLD IIOELSCHER
Explains Engineering Change

“The engineering curriculum
had been changing rapidly across
the country. The engineering
program is almost always under
revision, Ou-r society is always
changing, too, and there is a
close link between engineering
and society. The engineering stu-
dent must be prepared.” '

Rockefeller President Sees

‘Plug In’ Education Ahead

“The pres-sures on ‘all the
world’s educational facilities con-
tinue -to grow apace even though
the differences maybe extreme.”
These pressures were discussed
by J. George Harrar, president
of the Rockefeller Foundation,
in an address given recently at
the California Institute of Tech-
nology.

“In our own country,” stated
Harrar, “the pressures that We
originally ascribed to the. post-
war baby boom have now be-
come a permanent fact of life.

“Each year,” he saidﬁ “vastly
larger numbers of students must

be accommodated throughout the‘

educational network.” According
to Harrar, 'today’s society heeds
the primacy of the baccalaureate
degree.

Harrar also stressed that the
modern climate of education is
one cause for student protest.
“Students who experience the in-
tense pressures of modern life,

V and who are witness to the suc-

cession of failures in man’s ef-
forts to promote world peace
and prosperity, inevitably be-
come" concerned and feel that
they must rise in protest.
“Some of this activity (pro-
test), conceived in perplex-ity but

announced that Abraham Sing-
er of the University chapter of
Phi Epsilon Pi was awarded the
Joseph L. Moorse Scholarship
for the amount of $250 by the"

founded on intelligence and car-
ried on in good faith," he stated,
“is a healthy sign of the stu-
dents’ interest in the world
around them. inevitably, how-
ever, some of this rising tension
and confusion is utilized advan-
tageously 'by those‘ who would
destroy our form of society
rather than work constructively
to improve it,” Harrar pointed
out. ~ ' A
“Current evidence suggests,”

- Harrar concluded, “that in the

education of -"burgeoning num-
bers of ou-r youth we are going
to face more rather than less
difficult situations in the fu-
ture.”

  ()n Recent Program Change

He continued, “For instance,

_ in computer hardware, a multi-

million dollar advancement sev-

eral years ago may be obsolete
today. Things change pretty

quickly. The engineering grad-

uate must be able to not only

work with the changes, but lead '
the changes.

“The difficulty,” stated Dean
Hoelscher, “was ‘how to go about
the change and in What direc-
tions to take. Simultaneous with
our own beginning, the Ameri-
can Society for Engineering Ed-
ucation (ASEE) -started a study
of its own, called the "Goals
Study Reports.’ It suggested a

      

 

direction for engineering educa—  V

tion that we don’t agree with:
that a four year bac'helor’s de-
gree is a pre-engineering degree.
This is totally wrong.”

Dean Hoelscher believes that
the _ bachelor's degree is “very

important for men and women” s

as a base for three types of ac-
-tivities: those who enter indus-
try for a career; those who plan
graduate «study in engineerin-g;
and those who plan graduate
study in another ﬁeld.” He -said
that a problem of the -bachelor's
degree is creating a “depth of
understanding in four years.”

“We believe that students .0

emerging from this new pro-
gram will be better educated for

one of the three career goals I‘ I

outlined. They will, if we suc-
ceed, understand, appreciate the
important problems which con-
front our society. Many students
will continue to specialize in one

of the traditional ﬁelds while  -

growing numbers will choose
problems which cut across tradi-
tional departmental lines and
even across traditional .school
boundariesu Whatever their
choice, they will, we hope, he
better educated engineers.”

Dean Hoelscher concluded that
“we as a faculty feel that this is
likely to set a pattern for un-
dergraduate engineering educa-
tion.”

pg University Scientists Join

In Food Preserving Study

The University's Graduate
School of Public Health has an-
nounced a long-range study to
determine the biological effect
of -ionizing radiation in food
preservation.

‘The ﬁrst year contract with
the Atomic Energy Commission
will provide $65,000 for the proj-
ect, “Radiation Chemistry and
Radiobiology of Medium Ef-
fects.” A second project’ of Ion-
-izing Radiation of Food and
Food Components,” will be al-

lotted $44,261 ‘by the Food and’

Drug Administration.

Dr. Jack Schubert, professor
of radiation chemistry at the
University, will head the pro-
gram. Collaborating with him
will be Dr. E. R. White, assis-
tant research «professor of radi-
ation chemistry. Carrying out
parallel studies on’ the cytogene-
tic effects will be Dr. Niel Wald

and Dr. Sylvia F. Pan, both in

the ﬁeld of radiation health.

   

,A;lso‘, Dr.-Joseph A.’Wat-sen 

  

 

be in charge of the microbio-
logical aspects. Post-doctoral re-
search associates and graduate
students will ass-i-st in the work.

The researches in the exten-
sive program will seek to corre-
late the chemical changes in-
duced by radiation of food com-
ponent solutions such as sugars,
amino acids and vitamins on the
biological properties of 
ated solutions.

Dr. Schubert stated that the

irradiation is conducted with a '
12 kilocurie self-contained co- '

balt-60 gamma-ray unit. which
has the equivalent radiation
strength of 26 pounds of radium.

PUBLICATICN NOTICE / ‘

This is the last issue of the
Pitt News for this term. Pub-
lication will resume with a
special _36-page edition at the

, beginning of the fall term.

 

      
  

  

 

As The Pitt News draws to a close for the Spring trimester, it
is hard to fathom that so many changes have occurred during these past

few months.

The highlight of the term was, of course, welcoming our new
Chancellor, Dr. Wesley W. Posvar, who took office June 1. Dr. Posvar
replaced Dr. David H. Kurtzman, who then assumed the title of Chan-
cellor Emeritus and more recently was selected by Pennsylvania Gov.
Raymond P. Shafer to serve as our state’s Superintendent of Public

Instruction.

Dr. Posvar’s selection en-ded a two-year assignment by a Search
Committee to choose a new chancellor. Since Dr. Kurtzman had achieved
so much for our University, it was not without regret that we viewed
his leaving. However, a man of his calibre does not have to seek out
challenges; the challenging tasks somehow have a way of ﬁnding him.
Chancellor Emeritus Kurtzman’s successor is certainly a worthy one,
and we are looking forward to a year of continuing progress for our

Another change, one that directly affects our student population,
is former_ Dean of Admissions Jack Critchﬁeld’s elevation to the position

Off-Campus Housing

(This article concludes a series
dealing with the initial planning
of the Student Government Off-
Campus Housing Committee. Any
further columns will report the
findings and. the progress of the
committee "in its drive for Uni-
versity - owned apartment build-
ings.) ‘

THE ODDS are unfortun-

ately against establishing an

effective off-campus housing
program at the University.

C‘ These odds must be changed.

The Student Government Off-
Campus Housing Committee

.refuses to accept the conse-
 quences of a weak off-cam-
 pus housing service.

The problem of housing
shortages is not restricted to
Oakland. This very problem
has prompted President
Johnson to appoint Robert

 ‘ B. Weaver head of Housing
- and Urban Development. The

mayors of all the major
cities, moreover, have ap-
pointed directors of housing.

 This problem has been rec-‘
‘ » _ognized by both the Federal,
, state, and urban govern-
 ments of the nation. The sit-
-‘, uation must also be recog-

nized by the urban univer-

  sity-. This certainly includes
‘ the University of Pittsburgh.
 i If the problem is to be rec-

ognized by the University,
an effective off—campus hous-
ing service is a necessity.

IF A housing poll were to
be taken among graduate
and undergraduate students
at the University, it would
reveal a critical need for
rooms and apartments. Not
only is there a shortage of
housing but also a shortage
of housing at reasonable
prices, in adequate condi-
tions, and within walking
distance to the University.

Presently, the Off-Campus
Housing Office prints lists of
available "dwellings. These
lists, however, are a weak
answer to a snow-balling
question.

A second important result
of the ineffectiveness of the
University Off-Campus Hous-
ing Office ~may well be the
admittance of fewer students
from outside the Pittsburgh
area due to housing short-
ages. In addition, there may

. be students within commut-

ing distance for whom off-
ca.mpus housing would save
time, money, and inconvi—
ence. These students needs
are unfulﬁlled at present.

of Dean of Students Affairs. The choice of Dean Critchﬁeld was a wise
one, as he has worked with students in the past and has shown an aware-
ness of the student’s role at this University as perceived by the student.
_ Countless other changes have occurred, such as the excellent re-
vision of the engineering curriculum as announced by Dean of the School
of Engineering Harold E. Hoelscher last week. One conclusive point can
be drawn from all of these changes, howe-ver: the students can certainly
benefit by these actions. ‘ l
The transition period for our new Chancellor and Dean of Student
Affairs was fortunately during the summer, for this has enabled them
‘to deal with the potentiality of their positions in a period of relative
quiet. We can make no such guarantees for the coming school year. In
fact, we are hoping that just the opposite will occur. We hope that our
student groups will recognize their potential and develop programs and
plans that will enable so many of them to ceasefrom being the paper
organizations they too frequently are. '
All the tools for a productive year are there; the next step is ours.

Let our student body rise to the occasion of fulﬁlling their responsibilities

by Jack LaPietra

ment Off — Campus Housing
Committee has cooperated
with Louis K. McLinden, di-

rector of ‘off—campus hous-

ing, in relieving the housing
situation, to a degree. We
are working, however, with
nearly a ﬁxed number of
dwellings. The demand for
these dwellings is ‘continual-
ly increasing. Thus, efforts
such as surveys and articles
printed in newspapers soli-
citing housing will become
less signiﬁcant in the future.
Granted the new dormi-
tories will have a consider-
able short term effect on the
undergraduate populace, but
this does not help the grad-
uate student or the under-
graduate student who desire
to live off-campus. Further-
more, the University, on
both graduate and under-
graduate levels, is expanding
and will continue to expand.
Does it not follow that the
amount of off-campus hous-
ing should also increase?

.The committee is current-
ly occupied with assembling
a collection of plans and es-
timates of University-owned
apartments in Oakland. The
committee has also sent let-
ters ‘to other urban universi-
ties located in areas similar
to Oakland to determine how
their respective administra-
tions are handling the prob-
lem. ~

IT IS hoped that, after col-
lecting this data, applying it
to alternative proposals, and
presenting to the University,
the committee will have stim-
ulated the interest and co-
operation of the Administra-
tion. The committee will then
be prepared to offer assis-
tance and opinions in the se-
lection and reﬁning of a plan.
Its opinion will be derived
from a survey of present and
potential off-campus students
to ascertain their feelings on
possible questions. such as
price and facilities.

All of these actions are at-
tempts to commit the Uni-

versity to the housing prob- ‘

lem-——a problem which it can

‘, no longer afford ‘to ignore be-
causeof the growing demand

THERE MAY be “Perils
of Transferring” but most
of them are self-imposed. I
was one of the “transfer stu-
dents” two years ago. At
that time the University was
accepting a couple hundred
relocates and other students,
and unless a person did not
want to become an active
member of the University
community he would have
found it difficult to feel ig-
nored. ’ .

Last fall was -different for

several hundred students‘

came to the University. Still
the school provided transfer
parties for all these students,
but unfortunately less than
one-third of the eligible peo-
ple attended. Inaddition, the
Offices of the Deans spon-
sored transfer forums for in-
terested students. For the
girls in the resident halls,
the senior assistants helped
transfer girls in any way
they could.

ON THE whole, a trans-
fer student is given a lot of
attention. '

I /cannot make excuses for
the Office of Student Rec-
ords or the Advising Center.
Certainly one can complain
about disadvantages in reg-
istering, but about the only
thing anyone can say is that
courses do get ﬁlled up quick-
ly and that a student may
ﬁnd it necessary to do a lot
of his own registering and
orientation. This is especial-

. ly true for those who come

to the University in the

during the coming year. For if we falter, we will have no one to blame.
but ourselves. ’

spring for the ﬁrst time. This
must be understood because
during this term, transfer
students are the only “fresh—
men” on campus.

THE BIGGEST problem of
the transfer student is him»-
self. Each person must de-
cide whether he is going to
participate or hibernate for
the duration of his stay at
the University. If he decides
to do the latter, no one will
or should bother with him.
However, if he chooses to
become a contributing mem-
ber of the University, he will
have no trouble in doing so.

Activities abound, and the ,

student need only send his
name to a club president or
member. As for the critical
bystander, people who parti-
cipate constructively in the
campus program are the only
ones who have any right to
criticize any of the aspects
of the University. Those who
complain and yet offer noth-
ing to remedy what they
criticize are doing no one
any good. No university, no
matter how perfect, could
suit such people.

To paraphase a recent col-
umn in The Pitt News, “If
my experiences with the Uni-
versity so far prove to be
typical I shall never regret
my choice to leave Goucher
College to attend the Uni-
versity.” All the University
wants from any student is
a fair chance to function the
best it can with the help of
every student. .-

‘Pitt News’ Review

Cloud y Turning to A Clear Day

by ROBERT L. HOROWITZ

Some shows are so bad that I
feel like leaving before the ﬁrst
act curtain falls; yet I usually
stick -it out. One reason is you
can learn, if you're alert, just as
much from a bad performance
as you can from a good per-
formance. Another -reason is

that if the ﬁrst act is miserable .

the second act can’t be much
worse (or so I hope).

Before the end of the ﬁrst act
of this weeks Civic Light Opera
production, On a Clear Day You
Can See Forever, I had that
“urge” to leave. I’m glad I didn’t.
The main problem with the ﬁrst
act is that the songs are very
difficult to sing. Because lead ac-
tors Shirley Jones and Bill Hayes
were having singing diffculties
they could not concentrate on
their acting. The chorus’ and the
corps de ballet’s awkwardness
were no help. In fact, the only
enjoyable thing about the ﬁrst
act’ was that the orchestra (for
the -most part), was still on key.

While my “id” and “ego” were

deciding if I would leave or stay, .

my “superego” brought in the
deciding factor and “I owe it to
the actors, my readers, and the
newspaper to see this show to
the end.” This selfless feeling
doesn't often happen to me, so
I acted «immediately (I might
have changed my mind). I re-
turned‘ to my seat. I made the
right decision. (I won’t brag.)

‘ The second act was great. In
fact, it was one of the best jobs

awkward, young lady of «her ad-

diction to cigarettes. Miss Daisy
Gamble, the young girl, has ESP
(extra sensory perception) and
is capable of reading Dr. Bruck-
ner’s mind, tell where peoples
car keys are, inform one that
his phone is about to ring, etc.

While Daisy is under hypnosis, ’

Dr. Bruckner discovers that
Daisy is (perhaps) the reincar-
nation of a wonderful girl of the
18th century—Melinda. Daisy
falls in love with Bruckner, and
Bruckner falls in love with Mel-

Linda and a weird triangle.

Bill Hayes is excellent as Dr.
Bruckner. Despite some weak

moments in the ﬁrst act, -his

portrayal is by far one of the
best performances ever done for
the CLO. When singing such
beautiful songs as On a Clear
Day and Come Back to Me, his
well modulated voice rings true.
Shirely Jones, who got her start
in musical comedies by perform-
ing for the CLO Association,
had some great moments. Her
rendition of What Did I Have
That I Don't Have was her best
number. By the end of the show
her performance went from
“fair” to “very, very good.” Des-
pite difficulties, her return to
Pittsburgh was most enjoyable.
Especially because of Bill
Hayes and the Civic Light Opera
Orchestra, Alan J. Lerner and
Burton Lane's ﬁne show made a
good day On a. Clear Day.
