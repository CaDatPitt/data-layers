.0 Ignorance Cited

 Despite Price F reeze

by non LOZOWSKI

 ‘A number of Oakland landlords

rolling ‘again after. that is very

   

have raised rents in violation of
President Nixon’s wage-price
freeze, according to Ron Cowell,
director of the Off—Campus Hous-
ing Office. r

Cowell said that the majority of
violations are due to ignorance on

the part of the landlord—unaware-

ness_of the freeze, or a lack of in-

. iformation—not completely under-
, standing the order. Howeyer, he

added, “I.wouldn’t be surprised if
___.a few (landlords) are just trying

to,see how much they can get

g away with."

The freeze prohibits any in-

' :crease in rates, and also prevents

landlords from demanding ten-
ants pay for utilities if such pay-
ments were not previously re-
quired. .

.Cowell noted that “four or five” .
. inquiries had beenreceived thus

far. In one case, Cowell said “a
large. property owner." increased
a student’s rent and was reported
by the tenant. When the office in-

-- vestigatedhthe owner claimed ig-

norance of the freeze.

In another instance, said Cow-
ell, a landlord suddenly required
that tenants pay for utilities, when
previously this had not been the

» case. The-landlord explained that

his lawyer had informed him that
such a move was permissible.
Cowell remarked, “We told him
he’d better check again with his
lawyer, or ask the Internal Reven-
ue Service.”

In an attempt to prevent simi-.
lar occurences, Cowell said that
the office is distributing freeze in-
formation to landlords and stu-
dent tenants, in the form of {:1

series of questions and answers
provided by the Public Informa-
tion Office of IRS. Announce-
ments are also being placed in
such local-publications as the
Forum and Oakland News.

Press Strike 123 Days Old; 
Teamsters, Janitors, Hold Out

PITTSBURGH (AP) —- The
Pittsburgh Press and Post Gaz-
ette, newly beset by a Tea.-aster
strike in addition to a janitors’
strike, remained shut down Fri-
day—the 120th day of the city’s
newspaper blackout.

And no immediate end to the
blackout was" in sight. A spokes-

-man for the PHSS said it would .

be sometime this week at the ear-
liest before either newspaper
could even hope to resume publi-
cation. ‘

The janitors’ strike, which in-
volved 47 members of Local 29
of the Building Service Employees
Union, was begun Thursday over
a contract dispute.

The Teamsters’ strike was
started less than 24 hours later,
and it also involved contractual
differences. The Teamster drive
the trucks that distribute the
Press and Post-Gazette.

The Press planned to ask a fed-
eral judge today for ‘an injunction
that would prevent either striking
local from disrupting work at the
newspapers any further. I

“But that‘s completely a "gam-
ble, in a sense,” said one Press
executive Friday, “and whether
we’ll -be able to get the presses

- honoring another labor

questionable.” ‘
The two newspapers were first

shut down by a printers’ strike-

May 14. The employees worked
for the afternoon Press, but since
the Press prints the morning Post-
Gazette under contract, both
newspapers were blacked out.

The printers’ strike was settled
Aug. 29; everything seemed ready
for the newspapers to resume
publishing again. In fact, two ed-
‘itions of the Post-Gazette were
printed Wednesday night -— but
they never left the Press and
Post-Gazette building because the
Teamsters, though not onstrike
then, refused to distribute them.

(For a feature on the papers that
no one read, see page six.)

Violence flared briefly on the
Teamsters and janitors’ picket
line Thursday night when the now
nonstriking printers tried to re-
port to work.

Police quelled the clash with
police dogs, and there were no ar-
rests or injuries. -

Officers said the printers de-
cided to try to report after their
union leaders said that they could
not receive anyunion benefits for
organiza-

til3.n’s picket line.

HARRISBURG (AP)—Penn-
sylvania’s estimated 400,000
college students can vote
where they attend school.

A ruling Friday by Atty. Gen.

IJ. Shane Creamer put Pennsyl-

vania in the same bracket with
more than a dozen other states
which have decided through the
courts or via’ attorney general’s,
opinions to permit students to

vote where they study.

Whether Creamer’s opinion can
be fought in the courts remains to
be .seen. The Supreme Courts of
California and Michigan have up-
held campus voting in much the
same manner that Creamer did.

The matter has not come before

the U.S. Supreme Court.

Ron J. Pettine, deputy secre-
tary of the Commonwealth, said it
was -his understanding that
Creamer’s ruling meant that stu-

' dents who already had registered

in the community where their
family lived could reregister. in
the college town.

Filibuster Threatened

Draft Debate Resumed   

WASHINGTON (AP)—-Between
20,000 and 25,000 young men are

likely to be drafted during the rest"

of the year once Congress ap-
proves the new selective service
act, say Pentagon officials.

This would put the total num-
ber. drafted in 1971 at fewer than
120,000, lowest since 1964 when
104,500 men were called on duty.

Authority to draft men into the
Army ran out June 30 with expira-
tion of the old selective service
act and legislation to extend the
draft two years has been tied up
in Congress over a Vietnam troop-
withdrawal amendment.

A compromise House.-approved
bill was scheduled to come be-
fore the Senate today, but con-
gressional sources say it may not

” pass until sometime in October.

The bill faces a possible filibus-
ter by anti-war Senators, and its
provision for a military pay boost
may be struck down by the Presi-
dent’s wage-price freeze.

Senate Democr-atic Leader Mike
Mansfield of Montana, author of
the controversial amendment, has
said that while he cannot accept
the watered-down version of the
amendment prepared by a Sen-
ate/House conference commit-
tee, he will not himself obstruct
Senate action on total bill. 11

Before the draft was suspended
in June, 88,000 men were called
up during the first six months of
the year. Secretary of, Defense
Melvin R. Laird said in April the
Army would need about 10,000
draftees a month to meet its man-
power needs for the remainder of
1971.

But Pentagon sources say there
are no plans to make up lost
ground this yearwith high draft

calls in November and'December

 

However, they must do this by
the Sept. 13 deadline unless a fed-
eral court ‘rules otherwise in a
case expected to come up next
week in Philadelphia. The Ameri-
can Civil Liberties Union is seek-
ing to extend the registration per-
iod on the claim that students are
being disenfranchised. C. De
lores Tucker, secretary of the
Commonwealth, is defendant in
the action.

Creamer has had the contro-
versial matternnder advisement
for some six months. He reported-
ly shied away from issuing any
opinions pending a survey of simi-
lar actionsin other states.

One of the principal thrusts of
his ruling was that no special bar-
riers can be erected to the exer-
cise of the franchise by younger
citizens. This was-the case in vir-
tually all other rulings by the
various states to date.

Among other things, Creamer

ruled, the obtaining of “special .

burdens,” such as absentee bal-

once induction authority in rein-
stituted.

They say, . however, monthly
draft calls may be slightly higher
than anticipated during the first
few months of 1972.

An increase in enlistments help-
ed ease the shortage resulting
from. draft suspension and kept
training posts busy this summer.

“A study of ‘the lottery num-
bers of the. new enlistees show
they're still behaving as‘ if the
draft was going to be renewed and
figure once it starts again they’ll
get called anyway,” said one Pen-
tagon manpower specialists. “But

corollary facilities, improved ter-
minals, and general improvement
of cities’ arterial streets. With-
out such improved systems, he
said, the nation’s expressways
would rapidly be unable to fulfill
their functions, and. more and
more people would be unable to
use their cars on these highways.

According to the Mayor, mass
transit should be judged by the
benefits which it affords society,
not by its ability to pay its own
way, as happens today.

Daley said that Chicago has-
long been aware of this. The Chi-
cago Transit Authority (CTA) is
being continually expanded, he
said, even though the CTA is un-
able to stay out of the red. The

Mayor emphatically stated that

“Chicago’s position as a great
central city could not have been
possible without an excellent
mass transportation system.”

Daley expressed optimism in

S the ability of the nation’s cities to
.overcome the problems facing

mass transit systems. The pessi-
mism of those ‘who have I little’
faith in the future of the systems
arises, the Mayor said, “from ac-
cepting a trend as an unchangable
condition.” 0

SAIGON—President Nguyen Van Thieu will step down if here-

Thieu, the lone candidate, announced a week ago that he would step
down if he and his policies did not receive a “vote of confidence” from
the people on Oct. 3, but failed to explain what percentage he would con-
sider a mandate.

He also didn’t explain on what base the percentage would be fig-

PHILADELPHIA—President Nixon's new wage-price tax policies
‘‘‘definitely?’ will slow inflation and reduce employment in 1972'but
will not spur “exceptionally large changes,” University of Pennsyl- S
vania economists saidThursday in the prestigious Wharton Forecast.

The economists insteadexpect modest gains in the nation’s gross I
income, an improvement eventually in the international trade balance,
and the need for new restraints when the current 90-day freeze expires.

They called their forecast “one of the most significant ever made.”

“The administration will try to get away with as little firm con-
trols as possible,” predicted Dr. Lawrence R. Klein of the Wharton
Economic Forecasting Associates. ,

_ "‘Controls will be gradually lifted on prices, but wage rates will be
subject to guideline policies, and restricted to moderate increases of _
four to five and one-half per cent throughout the remainder of 1972.

The forecast, interpreting the new Nixon policies over the next
couple of years, said “the chances are stronger” the economy will im-
prove more swiftly on the domestic front than the international.

by NANCY RUTHER

One of the basic ideals of the
Intercultural House (IC) is to ex-
port the racial and cultural un-
derstanding they attain within
their group. As a result of their
efforts, many community projects
have been initiated.

Most recently 10 members of
the House spend the summer
working in Ghana, West Africa.

' The trip originated over dinner
one night last year, when William
Tiga -Tita, the Assistant Director
of the House, proposed the idea
of a summer in Ghana. The guys
,were enthusiastic and started
working on it. _
The major stumbling block
was financial, but support was
forthcoming from ._ many places.
According to Tiga Tita “the stu-

‘ dents contributed‘ heavily from

their own limited resources.
The University" helped us both
in kind and cash_—the Chancel-
lot and his‘ assistants: Dr. Carl
Beck. Director of the Center for

Heinz Hall Enjoys Gala openin

Pittsburgh (AP)— Heinz Hall
for the Performing Arts enjoyed
a gala inaugural performance
Friday" night, ' launching a new
era for the center which for years
"rocked to the tunes of vaude-
ville and "served as a motion
picture theater as well.

There was general critical ac-

claim for the dedication con-,

cert which featured the Pitts-
burgh Symphony Orchestra

under the direction of Dr. Wil-
liam T Steinberg, the orchestra's
world renowned musical direc-
tor.

The audience at the concert

iwas comprised of over 2,700

guests and included such Alumin-
aries as Nancy Hanks, chairman
of the National Council on the
Arts and the National Endowment

. for the Arts: Adolph Schmidt;

U. S. Ambassador to Canada;
Leonard Garment, special assis-
tant to President Nixon; and ac-
tors Gregory Peck, Charleton
Heston and James Earl Jones.

All joined in a standing, eight— A

minute ovation for the perform-
ance, which ‘began with Bee-
“Consecration of the
House” Overture, written more
than a century and a. half ago
to open Vienna’s Josephstadt
Theater.

The Heinz center, named for
the prominent food company
family, was built originally in
the 1920’s to house what then
was Loew’s Penn.Theater.

The Pittsburgh Symphony
acquired the then run-down build-
ing two years ago and set
about refurbishing it.

Acousticians who have worked
on the structure, which is adorned
with plush crimson chairs, car-
peting and drapes, have said -it
will rival Boston’s Symphony
Hall, generally regarded as the
best-sounding hall in the’ United
States. '

The concert, and those attend-
ing it, bore out their predictions.

  Obscure ‘Constitution
_Provokes ‘ Stalemate

I _Student Government is deadlocked again, and we who recall last
January’s impasse between the Allocations Committee and the~Senate

iltlirorial    

     

are appalled by the deja vu’. .

 Late last year, the student body approved a constitution that was
rsiipposed to preclude a crippling power struggle between the Alloca-
tons Committee and the Student Association Social Commission.

 But structural problems linger, compounded by personality prob-
‘flenis that are not likely to vanish until January, 1972, when new elec-
»tio_r_is_,are held. ’
V Asthelcritics of the constitution forecast, the document has been
.proven too vague. ' ~

—.th_§constitution, the Allocations Committee has refused to conduct fur-
-t,he,'r' business, until the four Student Association Commissioners sit

idown to discuss structural problems. '

 In the meantime, several student organization budgets remain un-
touched by the Allocations Committee and the Social Commission,
which‘ together must consider them. i

5 Who has the right l) decide on budgetary procedures? Does the
"Allocations Committee have the right to enact its own bylaws? Can the
'foilr»Commissioners override the,Allocations Committee on a Committ-
"s_~'roner.’s budget?. The consiturion only hints at answers to these ques-
jt_i'ons.  - ' _ - .

“f,As}Programs Commissioner Dennis Concilla points out, “No one in
tliéfstudénlt Association has been stepping outside. boundaries.” That’s
because clear boundaries simply don’t exist. '

__'-"-.‘Over the summer, the administration and the four Commission-
e'r's‘='devi§ed procedures to cope with the problem: they decided that
three of four Commissioners canoverride the Allocations Committee
on_'any: budget, except a Commissioner’s budget, which requires four-
of four-Commissioners tooverride. ’

‘ Unfortunately, no one invited’ members of the Allocations Com-
. mittee to the summer meeting, and the five members are understand-

Attracts Showoffs, Enthusiastsf

by ELLEN GANLEY
Night Editor-

Thursday’s Voter Registration
Rally was one of the most inter-
esting experiences I’ve had in a
long time. The many speakers
were interesting, though rather
repetitious (register, register,
register . . ..vote, vote, vote) and
the singers were excellent with
their message music. But, most
of all I enjoyed the crowd.

On entering the rally site, Point
State Park, we made our way past

the people already settled on the.

hot field and finally found a place
to sit within 20 feet of the speak-
er’s platform. —

The first person I encountered
was a black womanwho turned
out to be the oldest VISTA volun-
teer in Allegheny County. She told

us that she was working. for the‘

county welfare system and, at the

same time, was one of the leaders ,_

of the Welfare ‘Rights Organiza-
tion of Allegheny County.

After telling us that, she chuck-
led ‘and added, “They don’t like

CA to the Rescue!

Project 

 

5%

me too much at the welfare of-

fice. ”

Surprisingly, the crowd around
us wés made up of many people
who weren’t old enough to vote.
It seemed that their main pur-
pose there was to smoke a few
cigarettes and listen to Peter
Yarrow and John Kay. But even is
that was their only reason for be-
ing there, they couldn’t help but
soak up the optimistic atmos-
phere that prevailed at the rally.

Another person present is found
at any large gathering of young
people. He (or she) is the crowd
idiot, so obviously high (the con-

sensus of those around me was

that he was tripping), and that you
know he doesn’t care how big a
fool he makes of himself orwhom he
harasses.

I first noticed him when he
came up behind me after Peter

A Yarrow’s last number. He shout-

ed, “Is that Peter Yarrow?" and
’when someone told him "he had
guessed right, he yelled, “Far
out! and charged the stage. _ ‘

ring at the speaker,
“Bullshit” to everything Lindsay .

After shaking hands with Peter,
he returned to the crowd and sat
quietly for a while. When Mayor
Lindsay began to speak, the clown
rose again and stood there»point-
shouting,

said. Finally someone pulled him
to the ground, gave him a cigar-
ette and the clown fell asleep.

Last Thui-sday’s rally can be

summed up in one word . . . opti- P

mistic. Most of the people were
there to hear what some of Ameri-
ca’s brightest political .stars had
to say, and a large number of
them took the speakers’ advice
and registered. -Many were there
to listen to the music. And a few

-were there to make fools of them- "

selves.

But all of us came away from
the rally convinced that we real-
ly could change America’s politi-

calsystem‘ simply by usingvour -  i
right to vote or by campaigning  -’ ,-

for a favorite candidate.‘ If that .

isn’t optimism, what is?

by MICHAEL G. 0’LOUGHLIN “The Right Time and the Right Place" are clues‘

' “Hey, did you hear that Peter, Paul and Mary
are playing down at Pitt tomorrow night?’ Would you

like to go?”

f‘That would be great! lDo you have a car?” 
“Uh. . . no. Iwasihoping that you could drive."

“Well, I guess that takes care of that idea. I can’t
get a car and our bus won’t be running by the time
the show is over.” -

‘ “Yuk! Why does this always have to happen?"

Sound familiar? How many times have you been
in this type of situation? ' '

For ‘commuting Pitt students‘, this situation is
quite frequent. Many commuters spend their four
college years traveling to classes and retreating
home, unable to return for the evening events be-
cause of transportation problems. Rarely do they
become involved in any social activities.

Without social involvement, a student misses a
very important part of the college experience. This
social interaction, besides just having a, good; time,

is crucial to an individual’s intellectual and emo-

tional growth. V . A _
A person "can mature intellectually.only by dist-

cussing his ideas with other people who will pro— ‘

vide the necessary feedback. Likewise, to evaluate
his emotions, he must have an opportunity to share
his emotions with other young people.

The lack of social interaction is particularly poig-
nant in relations between the opposite sexes. For
examplehthere is probably a girl in Churchill who
would love to be out with some guy from the North
Side, but instead both sit at home on weekends be-
cause the right time and the right place never ma-
terialized.

to the problem. The comrriuter’s schedule is usual-

ly arranged on an exact timetable enabling him to_"‘ 

catch a bus or to beat a meter maid to his car.vHis_
free time is often limited because of these trans--

portation problems. ; T A
Even if he attempts to stay for evening activ-

ities, he is hindered by_the problems of catching a’ "
late bus or returning the car home at a reasonable‘

hour. ' V ‘

Besides living on a strict schedule, the commuter In

also lacks places conducive to meeting people dur-

_ingethe day. Although Schenley Hall and the Com- P’ ‘
mons Room offer some places to relax,-they are '

often quite crowded without a seat available.

Basically. then, the commuter’s lack lofysociall ’
~- involvement. stems from his scarcity of free time J
and the lack, of a place where he has the opportunity '

to meet newpeople. s '

In an effort to help ‘resolve this dilemma, them? .
Commuter Association (CA) is sponsoring “P.ro- , ‘ ‘T

ject Meet-a-Person,” ‘ which includes eight social
' events with an invitation to all Pitt students.

The majority of events are scheduled from about
2 to 6 pm. in an effort to offer'commut.ers ,a ‘con-

venient opportunity to get involved. The program’ ‘V  

offers a Variety of activities including two dances,

four coffee houses, and two picnics. All of these ac- '

tivities, including refreshments, are free of charge.
Obviously, these eight events are not going t.o

solve the commuter problem. However, it ‘is a be-’

ginning. If the events.are. well-suppoijted, the pro-
gram could be. expanded next term. ..

Why not come, and meet some people? They ‘=

probably would like tomeet you. i

 Military Justice?

"s 
lﬁ



 

by MICHAEL SIMON
Night Editor

Shortly after Washington’s first inauguration, the U.S. _army
numbered a mere 672 of the 840 authorized by Congress. Since that
time, the number has grown to 26,820,000 veterans and 3.8 million
men in uniform, according to Robert Sherrill. ~

The vast numbers of the military establishment, almost a sep-
arate nation within a nation, thereby necessitate a separate code
of justice to control itsown. The type of justice used, in fact, is
practically alien to a person who has not had extensive experience
with the military.

Sherrill emphasizes that the military justice system has ad-
verse effects on soldiers. “If they, by their experiences, have de-
veloped a tolerance for unconstitutional trial procedures and for
inhumane punishment, it means that the minds of nearly one—half
of our male population above the age of eighteen have already
to some extent been polluted by militarism, a militarism that is

_much more dangerous than the economic brainwashing that the

militarysindustrial complex has found so successful.”
By “unconstitutional trial procedures,” Sherrill refers to the

extreme differences between military and civilian justice codes. By '

civilian standards, military trial procedures would be considered un-
constitutional. , _

Certainly, the multitude of military trial cases with extraordinary
punishments would indicate a dichotomy between civilian and mili-
tary justice. For instance, refusal to wear a uniform has resulted

in puniishment varying between a simple discharge to three years .

in prison; refusal to obey an order, regardless of what that order
was, merited sentences of a few weeks in confinement to sixteen
years. —

The ‘Trick’ to military, punishment, Sherrill writes, is to make
“trial and punishment not only arbitrary but unpredictable.” This
is obvious in the cases cited, but more important, the guinea pigs
in these instances, the defendants, served their time or were con-

victed with the highlyprobable motive of ‘exemplary justice.” That‘

is, they served as examples to their peers. -
A The Army even admitted to Sherrill’s charge of inconsistency.

Discussng the arbitrary convictions, Lieutenant Colonel Theo-
dore E. Hervey, a high officer in the Pentagon's military Personnel
office’,'reported, “The varied responses our commanders make to
the dissidents, are going to keep them off balance. Whereas if our
commanders always attacked at dawn they would know. what to
expect.”

,, At least, those who still face the military can look forward to
some revisions in its code of justice and its punishments. However
the branding, flogging and summary execution’ of the 19th century
are not far away from some of the more modern methods of dis-
cipline. ~ ‘- w

..For example, the ‘-‘Ice Box”, a special punishment facility of
six. cages set on a concrete slab in the open. The cages were cov-
ered with canvas that was lowered duri g the sunn.y hours to par-
boil the prisoners and raised at night so they would freeze.” The
“Bull Pen”, some-what primitive by comparison was a “fenced-
area with neigher toilets nor water_fountains” in which prisoners
were held for up to eight hours.

At least the infamous ‘Ice Box’ and ‘Bull Pen’ were retired
from service when Dr. Larry McNamee, the Pendleton brig phy-
sician until July 1969 reported these conditions to the September
15, 1969 issue of The Nation. _ I

In dealing with these problems, the military, in some instances,
has tried to modernize. If nothing else, many feel that the re-
visions could clear out the overcrowded military prisons.

The sad fact of the matter, is that until 1950, the United
States had used practically the same system of justice as the Brit-
ish military. Recently, it was discovered that John Adams in 1776
had copied this code from the British, who in turn, had copied from
sterner European codes. ' '

Editor:

Friday’s Pitt News carried an
attack by Evan Pattak on Social
Commissioner Lenny Klavonic.
According to Pattak, Blood,
Sweat, & Tears was shaky. Ike
and Tina Turner hadn’tbeen heard
from in months, and one college

administrator (not named) said"

we’d be lucky to get the Fifth
Dimension because of sixteen
pages of riders.

Friday evening at the free con-
cert, it was announced that Blood,
Sweat, and- Tears is indeed com-
ing on the 23rd of this month.

A telegram was read from the
management of Ike and Tina
Turner attesting that signed con-
tracts would be -sent back short-
ly. We were also told that ad-
vance publicity had been sent
out and -that the date was sche-
duled in the trade magazines.

According to Klavonic, the six-
teen pages of complicated rid-
ers for the Fifth Dimension were
.successfully negotiated a week
and a half prior‘ to Pattak’s ar-
ticle. The only thing which had
been holding that up was a
meeting with the Engineering
Cabinet to transfer funds, which
took place Thursday, Contracts
signed by the University would
be sent back on Monday.

Something puzzling me is who
is telling the truth, Evan Pattak or
Lenny Klavonic? If Klavonic
really doesn’t have B-.S. and T.
and Ike and Tina Turner signed,
why does he insist he does, or is
the kid crazy?

Whoever the college adminis-
trator was, he should be fired.
If he‘s helped the last couple

V years to book groups, he should
get out of the business. The en-
tertainment was never worse.

Klavonic campaigned that he
would bring in a major group
monthly and he seems to. be on
the way to doing that.

However, if Pattak is not tell-

, ing the truth or is guilty of poor

journalism in what seemsdlike
a personal attack and some cheap
politics on the part of the “Pitt
News”, I question his compe-
tence as associate editor.

Pattak claims Pitt will not
see much in the way of quality
entertainment this year. I’m glad
he can see the future and knows
what will or will nothappen. It’s
one thing to judge a person
after something has not come
off, but Pattak is guilty of jud-
ging before it’s ever happened.

Klavonic got three out of 12
dollars for entertainment and
Pattak complains. I’m complain-
ing because the other nine dol-
lars goes to organizations which
90 percent of the students don’t
even belong to.

It’s an activities fee and I
want activities, not $3 worth,
but $12 worth. There could be
more entertainment (two major
monthly), cheaper
ticket prices, and a lot more free
shows, as the one on Friday
night. ~

The Pitt News has a responsi-
bility to the ‘students at this
school to report the news, not to
distort, manufacture, or out-
right invent it. If cheap politics
and muckraking are the trade-
mark of the paper, then it should
not be funded until it grows
upalittle-

Perhaps Pattak‘s attack‘ can be
‘explained by a similar attack
last. winter. Klavonic recalled
$4,000 of our activities from the
Pitt News account that the staff
would have paid itself for salar-
ies. This action was followed by
a violent editorial condemning
Klavonic and the social com-
mission.

If that is the case, the power
of the press is a dangerous one
indeed, especially when it serves
itself instead of the students of

this University. Ed Gmbstein

« The anti-tumor properties of
camptothecin were first identi-
fied in the 1960s when the drug
was shown to double the survival

' time of leukemia-stricken mice.
camptothecin has
been administered on an experi-
mental basis to patients with in-
testinal or rectal cancer and has
successfully reduced tumor mass-

- However, the drug is not consider-

A University professor has dis-

N.,~...sizing a scarce drug being used
experimentally in the treatment
' of advanced cancer of the intes-

‘Dr. Samuel Danishefsky, asso-
ciate professor of Chemistry, an-
nounced his synthesis of the drug,
-- camptothecin, after four years of

The natural source of campto-

tion of promoting them as an or-
namental plant. When camptothe-
cin was identifed as an antican-
cer agent, thousands of the seed-
lings were cultivated.

It was found, however, that,
some of the camptotheca tree
were required to process a mere
600 grams of camptothecin, and
this ratio, combined with the ex-
pense of processing the drug kept
camptothecin in constant short
supply. As a result, at least 18
scientific teams around the coun-
try have been engaged in recent
years in the attempt to synthe-
size the drug chemically.

The first successful synethesis
of the drug was reported a few
months ago by Dr. Gilbert Stork
of Columbia University, with
whom Danishefsky was associ-
ated on another project in the ear-
ly 1960s. Both men arrived at
their syntheses via different, in-
dependent routes.

Danishefsky’s research will
now be expanded in an effort to re-
fine the -process of synthesis and,

.more importantly, to‘ produce an-

alogs-variations on the basic
molecule——that are more potent
and less toxic than camptothecin.
Danishefskysaid that the toxicity
of the drug, which.must be admin-
istered in the relatively large dos-
es 'to effect tumor regression,
could eventually kill a user.

Cancer Drug Synthesized

The different methods of syn-
thesis arrived at by‘ Danishefsky

and Stork open up paths to en-_

tirely different analogs. ’

Though Danishefsky said that
his  . . synthesis of camptothe-

cin does not yet radically change
the availability” of the drug, he
predicted that a low-cost, toxicity-
reduced analog of the drug could
be on the market “in a year, with
luck.” '

DANISHEFLSKY: Four years bear fruit.

Gazette Lahored Hard

For News Unread

PITTSBURGH (AP)—“Way is Cleared for Publication of City’s Two
Dailies.” ‘

That was one of the headlines of Thursday’s Pittsburgh Post-Gaz-
ette, a headline almost nobody got to see because the papers never left
the loading docks. L

For while the way had been cleared for “publication,” it had not
been cleared for distribution, and members of Teamsters Local 211 re-
fused to circulate the paper for the 119th straight day. A few copies did
leak out.

The Post-Gazette editorial staff spared no effort in putting the edi--

tion together, even though they knew it probably would never reach the .

newsstands or doorsteps.

In-depth stories on Mayor Flaherty and the recent shakeup in the
city Stadium Authority, the police witness fee probe, the state income
tax, Vice President Agnew’s visit and a variety of other topics high-
lighted the 50—page edition. . . -

Sports Editor Al Abrams turned out a piece on rumors which are
sweeping the city about dissention on the Pittsburgh Pirates.

And he quoted Manager Danny Murtaugh as saying, “It never fails.

Let a team lose a few_games and someone pops up with the weird stuff
Remember in 1969 when Elroy Face and Roberto Clemente were sup-
posed to have cut each other up in a fight.”

There were also baseball scores, standings and pieces on Pitt, the
Steelers, the Condors and the Penguins as the paper’s staff went all out
after nearly four months of idleness. ‘

The magazine section featured an illustrated story on the sched-
uled opening of Heinz Hall for the Performing Arts, and inside were
the sorely missed comics and television program listings.

There were even brief summations under the title “What You
Missed in Story Comics,” covering everything from Dick Tracy to
Gasoline Alley.

TV Critic Win Fanning seemed to have never lost stride as he lead
off with “Good Morning” and tackled the TV programs of the day.

Full-page advertisements were scattered throughout the paper, an-
nouncing a variety of sales and bargains. _

As City/Editor James Alexander put it,_ "‘Our job is to publish a
paper and that is what we did. What happens to it after that is some-

body else’s business. We’ll keep doing our job until we’re told to do
otherwise.” A » .

Robin Hood’s Merrie Band, .Pitt’s outdoors club, will meet tomor-
row night at _7:30 in room .306, SU. Persons interested in any outdoor
‘activity are invited to attend. . '

The Student Union Board Public Affairs Committee will meet

tomorrow at 7 p.m. in room 506, SU. All old and new members are in-
vited to attend.

YAF Dumps N ixon,

by POHLA SMITH
News Editor

The Young Americans for Free-
dom have withdrawn their sup-
port of President Nixon as their
Presidential
candi.,dat_e_. ,

Declaring that Nixon has de-
serted the conservative faction to
move to the left, the group has an-
nounced its support of Vice Presi-
dent Spiro T. Agnew.

Agnew won the vote of confi-
dence in a mock nominating con-
vention during the Young Ameri-
cans for Freedom’s (YAF) bi-
yearly national convention held in
Dallas last week.

According to Frank Donatelli,
delegate and local YAF leader,-
the election was held to “see if it
was the feeling among grass roots
conservatives that young conser-
vatives are more anti-Nixon than
the older ones.”

YAF also passed a motion to
raise $75,000 to challenge the
President in the primaries. Don-
atelli said he was not sure if that
would mean actually. placing
someone in nomination or if the
motion was meant to help push
Nixon to the right.

The YAF expressed disappoint-
ment at .Nixon’s domestic policy
failures. But their primary objec-
tions were to his foreign policy,
among other things.

—“Overtures to Red China, done

in the absence of any public con-,

cessions by Red China to Amer-
ican and Western causes” and

—“His failure to call public at-
tention. to ‘the deteriorated

American military position, in I

conventional and strategic
arms, which deterioration, in
the absenceﬂof immediate and
heroic _counterm'easures, can
lead to the loss of our deterrent
capability, the satellization of
friendly governments near and
far, and all that this implies.” ’

Donatelli said the group will
probably take no further political
action until they have a response

from Nixon. Donatelli expressed I

 Votes Agnew Support

confidence that Nixon would try
to appease them.

“Goldwater found out in 1964
that he couldn’t win with only con-
servative backing,” he said, “but
in 1968 Nixon learned he could-
n’t win without it.”

In all probability, Donatelli said,
Nixon’s appeasement will come in
the form of support for a new de-
terrent system. The question of
building such a deterrent system,
Donatelli says, will be the pri-
mary issue of the 1972 election.

DONATELLI: Conservative Cadre.

How much influence YAF has
on the national voting public is un-
answerable. But conservative
sources say that it ranks only be-
hind the National Review in in-
fluencing American conserva-
tives.

Asked to define the role of YAF,

_ Donatelli said, “We consider our-

selves as a cadre of young conser-
vatives who will during their life-
time, ‘ through their professions
such as law, communications, and
politics mold public opinion.”

At present YAF has a nation-
al membership of 70,000 in a total
of 822 chapters. Approximately 40
belong to Pitt’s chapter.

New Ms. America

Monday, September 1:>;,1971—THE PITT NEWS-eagle 7--:-

Mom Tops byLaurie

ATLANTICCITY, N. J. (AP) —
Laurie Lee Schaefer began her
first full day as Miss America
1972 Sunday, outlining conserva-

tive views on politics, fashions.

and morality she believes are
shared by most young Americans.

Miss Schaefer, 22, of Belray,
Ohio, was crowned Miss America
at Convention Hall here Saturday
night. '

At her first formal news con-
ference she said:

“It would be good to end the war
but I believe we have a right to be
in Vietnam.”

- She also said she didn’t believe
in pre-marital sex, that mariju-
ana leads to “hard drugs,” abor-
tions should be illegal and that
women aren’t discriminated
against in America.

“I think the majority of young
people think the way I do on just
about everything,” she said.

Miss Schaefer, an auburn hair-

"ed, green eyed University of Ohio

graduate, replaced Phyllis
George of Texas as Miss Ameri-
ca at Saturday’s selection cere-
monies before 19,000 .persons.

Miss Idaho, Karen Herd, was
named first runner up. Second
runner up ‘was Miss Massachu-
settes, Deborah Ann O’Brien;
Miss'Pennsylvania, Maureen Vic-
toria‘ Wommer, and fourth run-
ner up Miss Maine, Allyn E. War-

‘ I161‘.

Miss Schaefer-said she hoped it
wouldn’t be necessary but that

she looked forward to making a
tour of Vietnam to entertain the
troops. She said President Nixon
was doing a good job of trying to
end the war. '

She said she was active in a
conservative youth group that
holds mock political elections, but
declined to name the organization.

“People will think, well, she’s
closed minded,” she said of her-
self.

She said she likes to dress con-
servatively and doesn‘t own a
pair of blue jeans.

As for premarital sex, Miss
America said, “It’s not_for me.”

Saturday, about 30 women picket- '

How long had she hoped to be

sister always telling me that some
day I’d be Miss America.”

She has one sister and two
brothers. Her father is deceased.’
When asked toname the person
she admires most, Miss America

,Today’s world is full of fads.
_ Many people consider en-

: ‘counter groups and places such
'as_ the Pittsburgh. Center for
.1-“Human Development to be here
_'today and gone tomorrow insti-
ﬂtutions, eventually doomed to
ffdeath because of lack of inter-
" est. After all, that’s what hap-

pens to all fads. »

But the Center for Human De-
« velopment has some very sub-
stantial reasons for its existence.

[ Shelley, the“(Tenter’s secretary
i , and part-time spokesman, explain-
" ed that with all the technology
‘ that has released man from his
. tasks," the individual has much
* more time to reflect on himself.
it Sometimes an individual cannot
 find his answers himself. The
,;.~.Center is here to help him find

‘these answers.” '-

“The Center was established
 three years ago by people who
’ 'were interested in the needs of
._ people in the world today and
in human growth," Shelley
9'1:==s,tated. The founder was ‘_a

  
 
 

    
 

psychologist who had been asso-
ciated with California’s Esalin
Institute and his first assistants
were people with knowledge
of encounter techniques and with
money to start and support the
Center.

The Center for Human De-
velopment, located at 217 North
Craig, sponsors a wide variety
of programs. The activities can
be divided into three groups,
eight session encounter pro-
grams, weekend encounter ses-
sions and a miscellaneous group
consisting of a camping trip,
a micro-encounter, yoga classes,
and the Center party.

There are six different types
of eight session encounters offer-
ed in the Center’s recent program
calendar. Some, such as the
Sense of Self, Totality, Beyond
Basic Encounter, and Intensity
programs, help the individual
learn to accept his own feelings
and at the same time, help him
in his dealings with others.
The Pittsburgh Melting Pot
and the Community Encounter

what isirequired to make a real
community.

The weekend workshop is call-
ed Pulling Together and . will
take place at the home of one
of the leaders. As the program
calendar explains, “The group
will work to turn a ramshackle
cabin into a livable home for
itself. The shared work experi-
ence will then serve as a jump-
ing- off point for an encounter.”

The miscellaneous events on
the program include a weekly
Hatha Yoga class, a Micro-En-

counter to acquaint people with.

encounter methods, and a Safari,
which will be an unstructured
out-door get-together. The Cen-
ter also holds a weekly Open-
house on Sunday night for any-
one interested in the Center’s
program.s

Shelly explained that, “Great
emphasis is put on self respon-
sibility at the Center. The_indi-'
vidual must realize that he is
responsible for his own actions,
even if they are
risky. But he may find himself
through these actions.” The goal
of the Center is to help the indi-
vidual learn to become honest
with himself and to associate
with others in an atomosphere
of trust and freedom.”

Presently, 75 people are en-
rolled in the Center’s program.
Groups are kept small, usually
12-14 people, to keep the ses-
sions as imtimate as possible.
Only half of the Center’s par-

ticipants are studentswith the

other half being made up of

professional and non-profession-

al people. The fees charged by

the‘ Center are graded into four

categories; students, simiprofes-

sionals, ' and persons with in-

comes of over $12,000. For the"
eight session encounter groups,

the student ‘pays $30 and the high

income individual pays $60.

The Center for Human Devel-
opment’s motto is “Reaching,
sharing, understanding; To-
gether.” The Center’s purpose is
to alleviate some ofthe pressures
that burden present day man.
If it succeeds, it is more than a
fad.

"Like I said on a pre-game show,
‘for the first time in three years
were gonna win.’" '

Sports Editor

“West Virginia was great, but
this is the greatest—because it’s
the first."

It was in this manner that Carl
DePasqua .described the 29-25
thrashing that the Pitt Panthers
dealt the Bruins "of UCLA before
36,205 people Saturday night in
the Los Angeles Coliseum.

“A lot'of hard work went into
it,” ‘the beaming. coach added as,

It’s been three years since De-
Pasqua has won on opening day,
but it’s been seven since the Pan-
thers have turned the trick. Six
of the seven losses have been to
the UCLAns with the seventh at
the hands of Oregon.

   Long Time
Comin’  

by JERRY MYERS
Sports Editor ' .
Beating UCLA on opening nightmeans a lot of things to
lot of people. To Carl DePasqua it means the first time in three
years he can kick offa football season with a win. .

For _the sophomores and juniors on‘ the team there’s the

  
  

;-glamour- of openinglnightat the Coliseum and a victory over the

14th ranked team in the country. For the seniors it means sweet‘
_ revenge-for a crushing defeat at that same Coliseum two years
gage. 1 2 —  

"But for Ralph Cindrich, Dave Havern and Howard‘Broad-

  head‘ it means more ‘than that. It means the first timein four
' . _years.that the-Panthers didn’t have put up with the clowns, the
jeers, and the hecklers. They finally had a chance to raise their

headsup as they _walked off the field.
‘. Cindrich, Havern and Broadhead have one thing in com-

‘mon. Theyewere all red-shirted for one year so they’ve been
"around for four years. This is the fourth time they’ve met head

on with UCLA in as many years at Pitt, but it’s the first time

; ' that the laugh was theirs. ‘

In 1968, Pitt fell to the Bruins, 63-7’. Cindrich got, hurt onlthe

, first series ofdowns and sat out the rest of the season_. The hum-
 iliation at the loss was only equaled one year later when the
g‘ Bruins again reigned supreme, 42-8. Pitt gave them afight last
 year but again_UCLA pulled it out, this time in the Stadium, 24-
 15. That adds up to a lot of humiliation. ‘

. . “I_ guess it means a little more for Dave, Howie, and me,”

J said Cindrich after the game. “This is the fourth time we’ve

gone against UCLA. ”

The desire was there._ You could see it in the Panthers’

movements. It was probably more than a coincidence that Cin-

drich was named the outstanding defensive player of the game, '
_ It was also more than just coincidence that turned Dave Havern

into the _“Mouse that roared,” Havern, incidently, was named

‘ the game’s outstanding offensive player.

(Havern wasn’t even listed on the pre-gamedepth chart in
the quarterback slot. Bob Medwid was. Havern on the other

I S . hand was buried beneath Jim Parros in the flanker position. But i

when John Hogan failed to move the’ team early in the second

‘ '1 . half, the “Mouse” got the call.

With thepoise that was shown in games like Baylor and
West Virginia, last year,’the seasoned veteran read defenses,
called audibles, and generally riddled the UCLAn defense.) When
the Panthers were down with a few minutes left, Havern kept

-his cool and tacked the winning points onto the scoreboard with
V nine ‘minutes 'left_in the game.’ ' "

. (On the other side of the slate, Cindrich and Broadhead com-
bined to silence the Bruin attack. Cindrich came up with a key
«fumble recovery late in the fourth quarter to helpice” it.

Coach DePasqua’s been in search of 60 minutes of solid

-football since he came to Pitt.VIn the Cats’ victory over UCLA

he finally found just‘ that.

At the same time three veteran Panthers found-something
they’ve been looking for, for four years now. Satisfaction. The
kind that comes. from a job well done. . '

proved that they were there to
play and there to win as they rid-

Bruin defense for 29 points.
John Hogan directed the first two
scoring drives, and then the old
veteran Dave Havern picked up
the slack in the second half to ice
the victory. 1

Everyone in California seem-
ed shocked except the Panthers.
Danny Lynn, who received, six
stitches across his nose was em-
phatic in his confidence.

“We "made a decision yester-
day,” said Lynn. “We didn’t come
all the way out here to lose.”

The hero turned out to be the‘

man who wasn’t even listed in the
quarterback slot on the depth
chart, Dave Havern. Havern (10
completions for 93. yards) direct-
ed two sustained drives in the sec-
ond half to pull the game of the
fire. . _ 1

But Havern wasn’t the only
hero. As Ralph Cindrich com-
mented’, “Even if we hadn’t won,
we gained something -out there.
Wewereatéam.” ' V '

John Moss echoed the lineback-
er’s sentiments‘ stating that the
game was “the greatest team ef-
fort since I’ve been here.” Moss
is now a senior and went all the
way at halfback.

John Hogan started at the helm
for the Cats taking them in from
their own '33, 67 yards for the
score. The 17-play drive was high-
lighted by three short first down
passes to Steve Moyer followed by

g STEVE MOYER
Injured Shoulder

 .(_1’{:r_1isleynkick),"_f‘, - '

 
 

a four yard run around right end
by Hogan for the score. Moyer,
who suffered a slight shoulder
separation only played half the
game. He caught six passes in
that time and is only 21 away
from the Pitt record.

Early in the second quarter the
Panthers hit paydirt again when
Hogan found Doug Ginden on a 21
yard pass. Ginden leaped for the
ball and then fell backward into
the end zone on top of 5-9 defen-

sive back Ron Carver. The Pan-

thers were ahead 14-0.

UCLA got their offense
in gear late in the first half, fin-
ally managing to push a touch-
down across with only 30 sec-
onds left in the second quarter.
Marv Kendricks, a 5-11 senior
from Mount Vernon, Ill.; "swept
left end for the three yard TD run.

Mike Flores, a‘6—0, 180, pound-

junior from Culver City, Calif.,
started at quarterback for the
Bruins and went all the way. He
managed to pick apart the Pan-
thers secondary completing 15 out
of 22 passes in the contest. He
did have troublesustaining the
long touchdown drives.

Much of the credit for UCLA’s’
lack of scoring punch goes to the,

Panther defense,‘ "who kept. the
pressure up for the entire game.

Ralph Cindrich, who was named
the game’s outstanding *
fensive player, regained the form
that made him an All-American.
candidate one year ago. Jack
Dykes grappled with Bruin Dave
Dalby all night and only came out
with his “head ringing; a. little.”
The important thing was that his
legs stood up under fire. Dykes,

shut off the middle forcing the ‘

UCLAns around the ends for short
yardage plays. ' ‘ ‘

Two sophomores, defensive end
Jim Buckmon and defensive tac-

kle Glenn Hyde turned in top-._

notch performances in their var-
sity debutes. While veterans How-
ard Broadhead, Any Mollura and
Joe Carrol kept up the pressure
on the struggling Bruins for the-
entire contest.

The defense only gave up 15

points in’ the course of the eve--

ning as UCLA cashed in on an in-
tercepted Hogan pass and a con-
troversial safety early in the sec-
ond half. “ -

The Bruins took the leadafter
the. halftime show and it looked
like Pitt was faltering. The of-

_ The Pitt soccer team faces its

first preseason competition
against Alderson-Broaddus tomor-
row at_ 4 p.m. at the practice
field behind Trees Hall.

 Pitt‘s Coach Leo Bemis has
already selected the varsity and
junior varsity players for the
' f_7l season.

‘Gary Midock, Fernando Carri-

Vquiry, Jerry" Kruth, and Mike
Pincus will fill the fullback posi-
tions.
' .Halfbacks for the bootersﬂwill
be Dennis Kozak, Tony Nichol-
aeouponlos, Dennis Kohlmyer,
Len Raffa, Larry Skalski, and
Gus Theofilous. '

Linemen for Pitt will be
Chucho Valencia, Joe Lux-
bacher, John White, and Bill
Rex.

; Steve Fibel will tend goal and
* Bill ‘ Haines’ will be the back-
up goalie.

Ali Rdissi. the sixteenth mem-
ber of the varsity squad, has de-
cided to leave the team for aca-
demic reasons. ‘

“Ali elected to go with his
, studies,” related Coach Bemis.
, “He's carrying a heavy load in
engineering and he couldn't

us.’ NAIA Champs

Boaters In irst Scrimmage

 

afford the extra time needed for.
playing soccer.”

All four fullbacks and four
lineman will start in the exhibi-
tion game. The starting half-
backs will be Kohlmyer and
Raffa unless Theofilous, who is
having eligibility , problems, is
given the OK. to play.

“And as it-stands now, Steve
Fibel will be the starting goalie
and Bill Haines will play back-
up,” said Bemis. “Haines could
be the number one goalie but
we’ll have to wait iintil after
the scrimmage~—then we’ll be
able to see who looks the better
of the two.” .

Bemis is expecting a highly
competitive game against Alder-
son-Broaddus who last year was
the number. two team in the
N.A.I.A., National Association of
Intercollegiate Athletics.

“I’ve never seen them play
this year and I haven’t ex-
changed rosters with their coach
because it’s only a scrimmage
game,” commented Bemis. “But
Iknow their personnel is good.”

“Alderson-Broaddus hasa lot of
western Pennsylvania players
(approximately 50 per cent or 12-
15 players) and they will try to
gain prestige in their own back-
yard by beatine Pitt.”

Makes Stennett Starter

by STEVE ZYCH

“I’ve been very lucky; I’ve got-
ten some very -good pitches to hit
at” is the way Pirate second base-
man Rennie Stennett describes his
astronomical .407 average (tops
on the Bucs) and his current 18
game hitting streak.

Stennett, though only 20 years
old, is hitting so well that Dave
Cash (.303) and team captain Bill
Mazeroski have been relegated to
subordinate roles. Cash is split-

ting the chores at third base with ‘

Richie Hebner in the meantime,
while Maz is being used primarily
as a pinch hitter.‘

“Of course, this won't last for-
ever,” stated Stennett in reference
to his high batting average. “Why
I didn’t even expect to make this
team back in spring training. I
was content with being moved up
to Charleston (International

Sjeague) after having played last
year for Salem of the Carolina
League.” ’

And what a year Stennett had at

A Salem last season. He not only led

the loop in hitting, but also_i’n at
bats, hits and triples. At the time

he was called up to the Pirates
(July 9) from Charleston he was
also leading that league in hitting.
Rennie was to stay only two weeks
with the parent club as a tempor-
ary replacement for the reserve
duty bound Dave Cash.

RENNJE STENNETT
Cashes In

Originally an outfield, he was
converted to a second baseman
last fall during Winter Instruc-
tional League..

“I like second base better any-
way,” says Stennett. “It’s just a
matter of getting experienceand
proper timing on such plays as the
double play pivot and how to posi-
tion myself ‘in respect to the hit-
ters. I might as well admit it. I'm
here because of my bat and not

my glove.”

How does the young Panamani-
an feel about all the sudden glory
surrounding his overnight star-
dom: “What’s the fuss all about.
It’s no big thing. All I really care

I about is that the Pirates win the

divisional title first and then go on
from there, and I honestly feel
that we _have a very good chance
to do that.” ..
“I just hope I can play my part
in that effort well,” adds the stel-
lar second basemanof the Pirates;

With his fine defensive play and
his hitting, Stennett has filled the
bill and is destined to be a major

' contributor to the Pirates of the

future.

Sparked by a punishing defense
and the quick hands of linebacker
Jack Ham, the Pittsburgh Steel-
ers romped to a 20-3 victory over
the inept New York Giants yester-
day at Yankee Stadium. The Steel-
ers finished their exhibition slate
at 3-2, while the Giants ended up
a dismal 0-5.

In preparing for their NFL open-
ernext Sunday against the Chi-
cago Bears at Soldiers’ Field, the
Steelers’ offense failed to gener-
ate the’ consistent attack shown
against the New York Jets last
weekend. Quarterback Terry
Bradshaw played the entire game,
and though he did not appear as
overpowering as-in previous con-
tests this season, he came up with
the big play when it counted.

After a scoreless first quarter,
the Steelers broke the ice early in
the second period as -halfback
Preston Pearson hit paydirt on a
one yard plunge. This touchdown_
was set up by wide receiver Dave
Smith’s reception of a Bradshaw
pass and the former’s subsequent
broken field running after the
catch.
