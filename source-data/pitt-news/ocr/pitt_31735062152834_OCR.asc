Local Chapter Has Made Prepar-
ations for Large Number of
Delegates.

NOTED WORKERS H E R E.

Men of Highest Rank in Associ-
ation Circles to Speak; Con-
ference Open to Students.

On Friday, Saturday and Sunday of
this week, the twenty-fourth annual
conference of the Pennsylvania Asso-
ciation of Student Y. M. C. A. Presi-
dents will be held at the University
under the auspices of the local Young
Men’s Christian Association. The
delegates to this conference, who con-
sist of the leaders of the local as-
sociations in the various colleges and
other educational institutions of the
state, will come to the meeting, each
with the problems of his own institu-
tion well in mind, and will then work
out the difficulties and consider the
possibilities for solving these prob-
lems.

The students from all the prepara-
tory schools, the normal schools, col-
leges, and universities of Pennsyl-
vania have been invited to send dele-
gates to Pittsburgh, and these men are
due to arrive Friday afternoon and
evening. The entertainment of all
these men is being provided by the
faculty and students of the University
and they will be taken care of from
the time they arrive in Pittsburgh
until they depart for their respective
Alma Maters. By this plan, the only
expense of the delegates will be that
of carfare.

In orden that the greatest good
may be derived from the conference
and also to help in the solving of
difficulties incidental to student Y. M.
C. A. work, many of the country’s
most prominent association workers
will be present and will speak upon
the various problems which the men
are most likely to face in their work.
Among these conference leaders due
to arrive Friday are: Richard H.
Evans, of New York, Social Service
Secretary of the International Com-
mittee; Harrison S. Elliott, Bible
Study Secretary; Dr. N. J. Exner, Sex
,Education Secretary; Paul Micou,
Eastern Field Secretary, all of the
same committee; Walter J. Campbell,
director of the County Work Course
of the Y. M. C. A. College at Spring-
ﬂ_eld; Frank N. D. Buchman, the Gen-
eral Secretary of State College; Dr.
Robert S. Calder the minister to Grove
City College; J. B. Carruthers, Penn-
sylvania State Secretary; and J. H.
Ehlers, State Student Secretary of
Pennsylvania.

Chancellor McCormick of the Uni-
versity will open the conference with
an address on Friday evening. Later
on the same evening a reception will
be tendered the visitors by the mem-
bers of the Y. M. and Y. W. C. A.
The remainder of the sessions will be
occupied with the addresses by the
leaders and the open discussions of
the delegates.

The ‘program in full is printed on
another page of the WEEKLY.

W. Li. PLANS“

I The young women of the University
are planning a spring /festival for

Commencement Week. -

The , Woman’s Activities Associa-
tion, of which every girl in school is
a, member, has appointed a commit-
tee to arrange this al, fresco enter-
tainment. Miss Helene Reed is chair-
man of this committee. The other
members are Miss Agnes Ferguson, a
student in the school of medicine, and
Miss Hulda Kenley, instructor in

ed for her. She will head the pro-
cession, which will open the spring
festival. All co-eds will be in this
march. Spring songs will be sung

lish and other folk dances.

The committee has as its advisers,
George M. P. Baird, instructor in
English; Carl Heinrich, instructor in
aesthetic dancing; Mrs. Laura Franz,
teacher of physical training for girls,
and R. W. Burckhalter, head of the
department of physical education.

Mr. Baird has been delegated to
Write a play for outdoor presentation.
It probably will require eight actors.
He also will plan the scenic effect.

The entertainment by the young
women, however, will not be all of the
commencement festivities. The exer-
cises of the week will begin with the
baccalaureate sermon by Chancellor
Samuel Black McCormick, in First
Baptist Church, Sunday morning,
June 13.

Commencement exercises with the
awarding of degrees will be held in

PHYSICAL A EDUCATION
CLASSES ON STADIUM.

Since the beginning of last week
physical education classes have been
held on Trees Stadium.

The students take part in three or
four track and ﬁeld events each day.
The classes are divided into squads

after they have become familiar with"

all events.. Each squad then takes
up the work which they prefer. Any
men showing marked ability in any
track or ﬁeld athletics are recommen-
ded to the varsity coach; thus the
work is a school for the varsity teams.
Relay races are run and competitive
games are played.

This work has been started with
several objects in view. Every college
man should have some knowledge of
track and ﬁeld athletics. It also
shows the best coaching methods and
also teaching the rules of the A. A. U.

It is believed that outdoor work is.

more beneﬁcial than indoor work.

which closes the regularseason of the

The seat sale will open next Mon-
day morning at 10:30, and will con-
tinue until 4:00 P. M. The same hours
will be observed on Tuesday. Students
may exchange their tickets received
last week for reserved seats at this
time. All seats will be distributed at

this time, except those for the mem- .

bers of the faculty. They will be pro-
vided for through mail service, since
it is impossible for the faculty in the
professional schools to be at State
Hall at the hours stated above.

After Tuesday, the remaining tick-
ets will be removed to a down town
store, where they will be open to the
general public. ’

Last Friday, the Glee club traveled
to Uniontown, where they gave a joint
concert with the Uniontown :' High
School Mandolin club. A large and
enthusiastic audience greeted the
club and the numbers were well re-
ceived. V p

This is the second time in as many
years that the Pitt club has appeared
at Uniontown, and so well were the
people pleased with the entertainment
provided that they assured another
return engagement next year. .

MGMASTERIS A POINT
BETTER AT PENN MEET

Pitt Man Features in Pentath-
lon and,_Makes Points in Other
Events. ’

 

Finishing third in the pentathlon at
the Penn game last Friday, Louis Mc-
Master made. an individual. record
equalled by a few men. in Pitt’_s ath-
letic history. Competing against_ a
ﬁeld of stars who outclassed him
hopelessly in size and weight, the
slender Varsity representative had the
crowd .with him from the ,_time, he
made his ﬁrst leap in the broad 'ump
until the 1500-metre race close the
all-round contest. ,_

Berry, of ‘Penn, took ﬁrst place in
the competition, with; 9’ points.
Worthington. of‘ Dartmouth, _just
nosed out McMaster with 15 points,
“Loiu” coming third with 16. Lamb,
the Penn State monolith, amassed 17,

and Creighton, of Pennsylvania, 21.

points. _ _

The Pitt man took. second in the
broad jump, with a..leap of .20 feet
111/2. inches. He was third in each of
the next three events, and ﬁfth in the
ﬁnal number, the 1500-metre run. His
marks were as follows :_ Javelin throw,
136 feet 51/2 inches; Discus throw, 93

feet lé inch; 200-metre dash, 21 2-5

seconds. .

- One feature of McMaster_’s per-
formance which appealed particularly
to Pitt men was his victory over
Lamb, the only other Western Penn-
sylvanian entered. McMaster weighs
but 135 pounds, as against Lamb’s
21 5or 220, but the Sewickley product
heldhis giant rival almost even_in the
weight -events, and beat him ‘in the
jump and the shorter run. During the
1500-metre grind “Lou” was nearly
all in, but managed to keep up -until
the tape was reached.

After a short rest and .a nub-down,
McMaster came out again, this_time
in the running hop, step. and jump,
and took down another third prize.
His mark in this event was 42 -~ feet
215, inches, almost two feet below his
performances in practice during the
week. Had he been fresh, instead of
just coming through the gruelling in-
cident to the all-round contest, ﬁrst
place should have come his way.

DISCUSS PERSONAL WORK
AMONG FACTORY GIRLS.

“Personal Work Among the Factory
Girls In and Around Pittsburgh,” was
the topic taken by Miss Esther Breed,
at the regular meeting of the Young
Womans Christian Association, -last
Monday morning. Her address was
extremely interesting for those who
are especially interested in social serv-
ice work.

The news was given out at this
meeting that in the near future some
interesting and instructive speeches

will be heard along special lines of,

work. The ﬁrst "of these speakers
will be ‘Miss Edna Russel who will
speak next Monday, on the subject,
“What Is In Thy Hand.” ,

CALL DFOR COLLEGE MEN.

Speakers Emphasize Fact That
the Trained College Man is
Necessary.

George Sherwood Eddy, Y. M. C.

' ;A. Secretary for Asia, who has given

much of his life for the advancement

of Christianity in China and India,

gave a. stirring address before the

student assembly last Friday in which

he showed the necessity of teaching
‘Christianity in the Orient and the

‘ [need of workers in that ﬁeld.

Mr. Eddy said in part: “ We owe
much to the Roman, the Greek and
the Hebrew. We owe our religion to
the East and we-are under obliga-
tion to carry Christianity back to the
East in their hour of need. The Ori-
ent is very much in need of Christian
inﬂuence and Christian workers.

“A country of vast natural re-
sourcesignorance and‘ heathenism
have caused it to be little developed.
There are immense stores of iron in
China and in the province of Shan
Si alone there is enough coal" to sup-
ply the World for years, but these
have not been developed;

“In the last 25 years however, there
has been a great awakening, political,
intellectual, and commercial. This has
been caused by the religious advance-
ment which they have made. Their
old religion which prevented develop-
ment and change, but caused them to
follow exactly in the footsteps of their
ancestors is giving way“ to Christi-
anity, with its uplifting inﬂuences.

“But the work has only begun; '

there are about four hundred millions
of people in China today and only a
small part of them have been touched.
More workers are. needed, and ‘there
is an excellent ‘chance for any person
who desires to consecrate his life to
the Christian service. These mission-
aries must work in unison, without
regard to ‘church denomination, and
the best results can be obtained by
ﬁrst winning the hundred thousand
powerful inﬂuential leaders in China.

“Half the world is without medical
knowledge, and many cruelties are
committed by so-called medicine men,
who pretend to cu_re. Half the ‘world
IS without physical, intellectual, eco-
nomic, social and moral life.‘ Many
people in India are always on the
verge. of starvation and have poor
unsheltered places to sleep. Natives
of China are bought and sold as cat.
t e.

“The only practical solution to
these problems is Christianity. There
is a big chance for a man who places
Godly success before worldly success
and devotes his life to the advance-
ment of the Christian religion in the
heathen countries of Asia.”

Mr. Davis, who is interested.in mis-
sionary work in Constantinople, spoke
of the success which has attended his
efforts and of the need"-of help in his
chosen ﬁeld. He said:

“When one becomes acquainted with
the Turks he ﬁnds that instead of the
terrible, unjust, cruel oppressor which
he has pictured in his mind, he ﬁnds
a man very humane, and very much
like , “the American, except for_ his
language and "his dress. He is not
hard to convert to the Christian faith
and workers have large possibilities.

“The strong, virile, energetic man

is the man the Turks revere, and re-
spect. The_ University of Pittsburgh
should add her name to the list of
colleges and universities that are
sending this type of men_ into for-
eign ﬁelds.”
. The assembly next week will be in
the hands of the board of control,
and will be taken up with the dis-
cussion of student affairs.

PITKIN CLUB TO
ELECT OFFICERS.

In the absence of the leader, Dr.
Hugh T. Kerr, last Wednesday, the
mission study class of the Pitkin club
was conducted by the president, H.
Norton _Wawhinney.

Election of officers will be held ‘May
19. "A nominating committee composed
of J. H. McKee, Vivian Mool and P.
J. Cook, was appointed to report at
the next meeting.

reel ﬁlm which is the biggest and
most costly motion picture made in
America, and shows Jwith complete
accuracy how the work of the various
departments of the United States gov-
ernment is carried on. At the same
time it is an entertainment, for it
shows many things which amuse, ab-
sorb and thrill.

Among the scenes are views of the
departments at Washington, ﬁghting
forest ﬁres, making ‘money, battle-
ships in action, the revenue cutter
service, cavalry maneuvers, Bureau of
Standards, postal service, life saving
crews, public health service, etc.
These pictures with their full mechan-
ical effects are explained by an ex-
pert.

method maps representing geological

Convention This Evening in’
204 State—Amendments to be

Acted Upon.

The political cauldron of student
government in the University, which
has been simmering gently for sev-
eral weeks past, suddenly boiled over
last _week, when the proposed new
constitution, which had been drafted
by the Constitutional convention, was
reported out of committee to the stud-'
ent body at large, through the columns
of the WEEKLY, an election author-
ized for Monday, by the student sen-
ate, at the meeting of that body on‘
the previous Monday and that elec-
tion as suddenly called off by the stud-
ent board of control at its meeting of
last Wednesday evening. The board
gave as its reason for such postpone-.
ment that the time set was too short
for proper consideration of the new
system and with the end in view of
discusing and amending the consti-
tution as draftedcalled a special meet-
ing for Friday evening at which -the
members of the convention were in-
vited to be present. ‘ At the time set,
a quorum of the board of control was .
not present, and no official busi-
ness could be transacted, the
members of both bodies being unable
to arrive at any satisfactory adjust-
ment or compromise on the matter,
in their unofficial capacities.

The latest developments in the case
have aroused the interest of the stud-
ent body to a high pitch. President
G. Fred Ashe, Ed. ’15, of the board of
control and the student senate, hasrs-,
signed his position as the official head
of those bodies, his resignation ‘being

board. A meeting of the board is set

Simultaneously, a general

student body are cordially invited "to
be present and express their views,

subject of the new code.

tion will take ﬁnal action at "this

body, and students desiring changes
in any of ' its articles are urged by
the convention to submit amendments
to-night.

The University assembly on Friday
morning is expected to furnish fur-
ther developments, as the program is
announced to be in charge of the stud-
ent senate, and it is understood that
some form of discussion or vote will
be taken upon the question of the
new constitution.

THE WAY OF THE
REFORMER IS HARD.

Rocks have risen in the path of the
proposed constitution which was pub-
lished as drafted by the constitution
convention, in last week’s issue of the
WEEKLY. The rocks are not in the
nature of valid ﬂaws or objections to
the content of the constitution itself,
but are rather the fulminations of cer-
tain individuals who, though declaring
their innocence of . ersonal motive,
yet criticise the thods and the
legality of the body which framed the
document.,

We will endeavor to dispose of their
arguments and objections in as brief
space as possible. In the ﬁrst place
it is claimed that the whole proceed-
ing is radical and revolutionary and
therefore to be condemned. To the
first portion of this statement, we
gladly accede. It is radical and revo-
lutionary, and the times and condi-
tions call for just such action. Any
fairminded individual who has -read
constitution under which the present
semblance of student government is
carried on, cannot help but remark
that there is absolutely no basis there
for any constructive program of leg-
islation or execution. From alpha to
omega there is not an article or a sec-
tion in the old constitution which
would not proﬁt by restatement, and
we say this with all due deference to
the gentlemen who composed the com-
mittee, which, back in 1910, convened
to draft it. The present convention
is censured for abandoning the old
and creating the new. It is censured
for not presenting its recommenda-
tion in the form of amendments to
the old. We ask candidly, would it
be possible or practicable to present
an amendment to take the place of
every article and section of the old?
The only proceedure which was at all
feasible was that which the conven-
tion took, of framing an entirely new
document. The resolution which the
convention passed at its ﬁrst meeting
was to the effect. that it was the con-

' sensus of the body that an entirely new

revision would have to take place, and
that such revision was not being made
with any intent to antagonize any ex-
isting body or member of such body.
The senators and members of the
student board of control who are loud-
est in their opposition to the new con-
stitution, must be absolved from any
oflice-holders or seeker’s ambition, in-
asmuch as they either have already
expressed their intention to retire
from politics, or are expecting to

I .graduate within the ensuing year.
. Neitiier can similar charges be made

against the members of the constitu-
tional committees, for the latter have
agreed not to become candidates at
the coming election for any of the
governing offices. which, in some cases
prohibits them from ever attaining
such office during their stay in the
University. We must look, then, to
some other element for the cause of
the storms that have arisen. As it
looks to us, it is simply a case of peev-
ishness on the part of the members
of the board of control and certain
members of the student senate, be-
cause their valuable experience and
judgment was not consulted in the
matter, before that of the student
body. It is once more the old ques-
tion, whether the common man or the
chosen servant of the people is the
possessor of the greater authority and
acumen. Carlyle and R/uskin were
hero-worshippers, doubting the ca-
pacity of the populace which com-
posed the electorate to pass upon
weighty questions of government.
Divine right meant to them a point
of expediency. The mob could not
be trusted and therefore kings and
oligarchies are justiﬁable, inasmuch
as they know better than the people
themselves what is best ‘for them.
When a child disobeys a parent’s com-
mand, we .grant the parent’s superior
wisdom and prerogative of laying
down the child's .1-u_les__of conduct. The-
person of _religious temperament
grants to a just and omnipotent God
the r1ght'to govern, trusting that “all
things will work together for good.”
But when it/comes to the studentbo y‘
of an American University, are we go-
ing to claim that they are too_ much
swayed _by demagogism or rash and
hasty vision to be allowed to deter-

a mine whether a constitution under

Whid! the are to be governed shall
stand or all on its own merits, and

" *---

not to constitute a ﬁnal and sufﬁcient
authority on the point? We do not
think so. Without “spread-eagleism
or waving of star-spangled banners,”
which is apparently so much feared
by some of _.the objectors to the pro-
posed method of proceedure, we be-
lieve that the electorate of this Uni-
versity is so qualiﬁed and should not
be placed upon the same plane as the
commons of England or of any demo-
cratic nation. What, indeed is the
function of education, if it is not to
develop the individual’s power to
adapt himself to new conditions, his
faculty of discrimination,’ his civic
and social consciousness? Are not the
college graduates of the country ex-
pected to furnish a high percentage
of her brains and her leadership? Is
not the testimony of “Who’s Who in
America” sufficient upon this matter?
We continue therefore to maintain our
original position. The constitutional
convention was authorized under reso-
lutions passed in meetings of the four
undergraduate classes of the student
body, which despite the meager at-
tendance at class meetings, a thing
certainly as much deplored by us as
by any, are yet considered ample and
sufﬁcient to transact all other official
class business, of whatever degree of
importance, including matters like the
Prom and the Owl which vitally ef-
fect the entire University. The con-
vention did its work, and the election
which they asked for was approved in
a regular meeting of the student sen-
ate, and yet we have still with vusthe
archaic methods of government by the
few which ‘has characterized and
weakened our student government for
the past year. What are YOU, as a
component member of the student
body of the University, from whom
comes all authority, and in whom re-
sides the power to revoke all dele-
gated authority, going to do about it?

THE OLD GUARD.

The death on March 15 of Samuel
Bowles of the Springﬁeld Republican,
and that on April 13 of William Rock-
hill Nelson of the Kansas City Star,
markedthe passing of almost the last
exponents of the grand old school of
“personal journalists,” whose names
were synonymous with their publica-
tions for the last half-century—-Gree-
ley, Dana, Grady, Medill, Bennett,
Pulitzer, and the rest. Only “Marse
Henry” of “Courier Journal” fame,
remains to give eloquent testimony to
the ravages of Father Time’s terrible
batteries in the editorial “Old Guard.”

Of Bowles and Nelson it may well
be said, as Colonel Rooseve t, in
speaking of Mr. Nelson's death, voiced
it: “We have lost literally two of the
best and foremost citizens of the
United States, men whom our republic
could least afford to spare.” They
were men of opposite type, the one a
true New England patrician, of the
lineage of the Pilgrim, the other a
democrat with a little “d,” of broad,
expansive mold, and.,Lincolnian sym-
pathies. And yet both were MEN-—
the all-important and essential stuff
from which are fashioned the destin-
ies and civilizations of nations.

Samuel Bowles was bred and born
in Massachusetts, the product of a
long line of Puritan ancestors, the
last three of whom had borne the
name Samuel before him. Of that
phase of his personality, “Collier’s”
characteristically r e in a r k s that,
though he could have written “IV”
after his name, he did not do so. He
was an aristocrat Without the osten-
tation of aristocracy, of the blood
royal without the snobbery of kings.
He was educated privately, at" Yale,
and in Europe, and was trained from
the beginning to succeed his famous
father at the helm of “The Republi-
can.” The paper was started by his
grandfather, the second of the name
of Samuel, in the twenties, as a feeble
weekly. His son, the’best known of
the family, made it a daily, and raised
it to the plane of national journalism
by his magniﬁcient business acumen
and far-sighted editorial policy, cre_-
ating by his own effort “The Republi-
can’s” splendid reputation for accur-
_acy, sanity, and wide culture. His
son, Samuel, whose death we are now
mourning, trod every round of the
ladder of publication before he ascen-
ded the throne. He was ﬁrst an as-
sistant in the editorihl department,
then business manager, then editor,
and ﬁnally sole owner. Bowles was
a reserved man, though possessing a
remarkable talent for the kindlier
graces of social life, a man of a few
rare and privileged friends, a _man of
exceedingly broad interest in the
realms of civics, municipal govern-
ment, philanthropic advancement, art,
literature, and the higher branches of
learning. He was not a public speak-
er, but on.- one of the rare occasions
when he could.be persuaded  mount
the platform, in an address in 1913,
before the Pulitzer School of Journal-
ism of Columbia university, he gave
expression to his journalistic creed in
words which will stand for all time
as an enduring monument to his own
character, and that of the newspaper
which he guided: _

“The primary duty of ~21 newspaper continues
to be to chronicle accurately and truthfully the
events of consequence in its own environ-
ment and to promote there. earnestly and
persistently, the public good. Consider for a
moment how essential it is for the peace, and
order and normal healthy development of any
community, that its daily life and movement
shall be correctly set forth to its responsible
members. How otherwise can they act intel-
ligently for the individual and the common
welfare? The agency of information upon
which the very structure of the community
thus necessarily rests in our modern society,
is the daily newspaper.

“To my mind, there .is no occupation in
which men engage, none even of the so-
ealled learnedprofessions, law, medicine, theol-
ogy, which demands a higher standard of
ethics in its pursuit than journalism-and this
because of its extraoardinary powers and op-
portunities in aﬁecting public welfare."

William Rockhill Nelson was pri-
marily a great editor, too. iHis meth-
ods in the conduct of “The Star” were
as individual as everything else he did.
His interest in the paper extended to
the smallest details. But of late
years, he had paid little attention to
the business routine, becoming largely
absorbed in the editorial duties. He
almost never wrote anything with his
own hand. .He was too busy for that.
But never a day passed that he did
not outline to his subordinates articles
of some sort, giving striking sentences
which could be used verbatim. He
was _a master of terse, epigrammatic
English, and had a wonderful facility
for constructive criticism of things

 

read to him. ' He was impatient of the ‘

. Notre Dame was proud to confer (upon

illustrate this quality: “I don’t enjoy
travelling in a. well-trodden pat ”
“ ‘The Star’ should pioneer; what the
other fellow does doesn’t interest me.”
He never made concession to yellow
yellow journalism, but kept his paper
constantly_ on the. highest possible
typographical and literary level. “So
long as I have anything to say about
it," was his declaration, “William
Randolph Hearst isn't going to edit
‘The Star.’ ” “The Star” was a pas-
sion with him. Nothing hurt him so
much as to see it do things in a com-
monplace way. Nothing delighted
him so much as a piece of work that
showed distinction in treatment. He
considered extracts from standard
authors, commonly utilized as “ﬁllers,”
highly important. “Plato and Emer-
son and Carlyle,” he said, “are just as
good correspondents as chroniclers of.
dog-ﬁghts in San Francisco.” -

_ Hispersonal traits were unconven-
tionality incarnate. Apparently he

from several institutions of learning,
and although his parents were Episco-

that the strict discipline of the fath-

on the wayward son. At the time

LETTER BOX

April 26, 1915.
The Editor of the PITT WEEKLY, '

Dear Sir:—In the midst of the con-
fusion which has attended the pres-
entation of the report of the Consti-
tutional Convention, it may be well
for «us to consider carefully and estab-
lish ﬁrmly in our minds the truth as to
the causes underlying the calling of
this convention, the owers given it,
and the legal status 0 "the body. Much
has been said and done, intentionally
and otherwise, to cloud the issue.

_The_ Constitutional Convention was
established by_ authority of the stud-
ent body, acting through classes, in
the case of the undergraduate schools,
and by schools, in Dentistry and Medi-
cine. Its purpose was the considera-
tion of plans for changing the exist-
ing organic law of the student body,
and a report to the students as ‘to the
measures which it deemed advisable.
It consisted of eighteen students, who
may be fairly said to -represent
welelll dhe ability and judgment of the
sc oo .

This Convention gave careful and
extended consideration to the old
constitution, and after due delibera-
tion deemed it advisable to complete-
ly rewrite that document, which was
in many ways quite inadequate.’ All
written and verbal suggestions, from
whatever source, were fairly consider-
ed before the new constitution was
puplicly - presented.

The General Senate at its meeting
on April 19th, authorized an election
at which time the students them-
selves, the body from which the au-
thority of the Convention came, should
vote, article by article if they wished,
on this report of their representatives.
The student body is the source of all
poiver in student affairs and they by
ch ir own action evidenced the desire
for a change in their systemof’ gov-
ernment. To the student body alone
is the Constitutional Convention re-
sponsible, and it is little short of
ridiculous for any body of representa-
tives, actual or alleged, to demand
that they be permitted to modify or
destroy at will- the constitution so
carefully prepared by the committee
chosen for that purpose.

Let us see to it that we understand
just what we are talking about in
this matter, and that we do not per
mit ourselves to be deceived by lou
discussion of matters which have
nothing whatever to do.“with the mat-
ter in hand.

Very truly yours,
INTERESTED.

Editor PITT WEEKLY:

The high-handed action ofthat self-
appointed, aristocratic, despotic body
of students, legally called the Board
of Control, privately called unprint-
able things, in calling off an election
duly authorized by the direct repre-
sentatives of the student body, is the
culmination of a long list of question-
able acts that have characterized
their actions for the past two years.
Their acts of omission and commission
are so well known that they need no
repetition here. Once they presumed
to represent the student body, but
long since have they degenerated into
a gang (no other word expresses“ it
so well), of cheap, jitney-minded poli-
ticians seeking their own authority at
the cost of school spirit and to the
discredit of the University. The soon-
er these mistaken individuals realize
their positions, which is doubtful, the
better it will be for everyone con-
cerned. ‘

A MEMBER OF THE STUDENT .

A Defense of the Lazy Man.

It was whispered about in high
places last week that there are to be
compulsory examinations in all sub-
jects this year. No exemptions, think
of it! For one I have always cherish-
ed 'a dreadful fear of work, and I as-
sure you that I did not receive this
sad news without a shudder. Surely
the faculty does not appreciate the
value of the lazy man. What, indeed,
would the world ever do without its
amiable idlers? »

Lacking evidence to the contrary, I
am quiet sure the inventor of the
wheelbarrow was a very lazy man.
Who but such a one would have
thought to save so much labor? And
this appears to be true of all the great
inventions of the world. Although
the invention may be a step ahead in
the search for efficiency, it still helps
the lazy man for less work has to be
done.

The only thing that seems to con-
trovert the claim that all inventors
are lazy men, is thefact that work
must have been done in order to make
these inventions. But this is a cap-
tious argument, since it is highly
probable thatgthe real inventor never
received credit for his contrivance. In
all likelihood he told someone of his
discovery, and the latter then claim-
ed the originality of the idea; in which
case the true inventor would be in-
disposed to contest the impostor’s
claim in court as this procedure would
entail far too much work and sus-
pense. Baut supposing that the in-
ventor did do all the work himself,
there is still some excuse for him.
Perhaps the great and unceasing in-
dustry about him worried him insane,
and he forgot his principles against
labor. Hence whatever the means,
the incentive was certainly the lazy
man’s love of ease.

The industrious man, on the other

hand, works incessantly until he be-

comes nothing but a human machine.
Most of his work is mechanical; all
of it in time becomes monotonous. Let
him hear sixty seconds tick past with-
out having learned a new date or an
obscure fact and he groans in awful
anguish.’ While shaving, he wields
the razor in one hand whereas in the
other he holds his Ovid, French gram-
mar, or Calculus, to which he devotes
the full attention of one eye, and what
is the result of all this work? Sim-
ply this: the industrious man per-
ceives that everything about hini is
far from perfection; he becomes an
Utopian dreamer; he seeks to rectify
conditions; and when he fails, as he
invariably does, he becomes an irrc
claimable pessimist. '
Now the lazy man does not waste
his time building air-castles; he is
too indolent for that. Instead he takes
the world as it is; and when he has
anything to do, he gets the industrious
man to do it for him. The lazy men
are therefore the most successdul
n-
deed, I know of one lazy man, who,
when his house was burning down,
suggested to his industrious neigh-
bors that they risk their lives in order
to save his property; with the result
that, though his house burned to the
ground, very few of the furnishings
were even damaged.

CHINA AND COSMOPOLITANISM.

ments and requests have been received upon
the speech of Mr. Chan at the University

FOOTBALL RESTORED AT
COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY.

 

‘ By the decision of the university
council, students of Columbia Uni-
versity again are allowed to play in‘-
tercollegiate football under certain re-
strictions. Football was abolished in
1905.

The conditions under which the

sport is restored provides that no{

freshman or graduate students are to
participate, that all games are to be
played on college grounds and on Sat-
urdays and holidays and that games
for the present are not to be played
with Princeton, Harvard, Yale, Cornell
and the University of Pennsylvania.

A schedule of games will be made
at a meeting of the athletic commit-
tee this week.

students we have found the opportuni-

ty to learn what previously had been
considered defects (we have found

them to be traits of personal char-:

acter) which when understood allow a
greater degree of intimacy and ap-
preciation than could exist in the day
when the walls of prejudice and fear
circled the min ‘*».._of the nations of
the world. 

It is that state of mind which calls
for this mingling and resultant under-
standing of the different people which
is the spirit of the cosmopolitan
movement; repreiented by our organ-
ization here. I is a movement of
college men, men who will attempt
to understand the uselessness of the
eternal war for the personal commer-
cial monopoly and who can see in that
race which differs from his own those
similar traits of home and race con-
nections which mark them as a part
of the human family; those differ-
ences which mark one man from an-
other—the physical differences, the
historical differences. the differences
of custom and creed are to the re-
stricted mind impassable barriers.

These differences are not barriers.
Rather they are what we term in the
individual personality.
a barrier, it is a form or recognition
—rather’ than an impassable some-
thing, it is, when recognized, the
stimulus for racial friendship.

What we know as a race is of value

to what you have experienced. What?

you have been as a people is of value
to what we may be. Yourhistory
bears on our history.

the future. Our sacriﬁce of the pres-

ent is made with the knowledge of ‘

the past in view. Our relation to you

in the coming ages is made strong or .

Weak as we are known to be members
of the one human family. And in
that human family we can ﬁnd those
bonds which will give foundation to‘
the future of the human race—when

friendship is the only power which‘

rules.

' In the understanding of the people" 1
will form the friendship of one nation-
for another; the desire of - the Occi-;
dent to help the newest nation of the.
world; the altitude which will tend to‘-

obliterate the boundaries of one nation
from another and will emphasize the
possibility of the truth of our motto-—
Above all Nations is Humanity.

This is our aspiration. It is o-ur
desire. It is the hope of the cosmo-
politan minds of the world.

CORNELL‘ SYSTEM SIMILAR.

With the idea of acquainting mem-
bers of the General Alumni Associa-
tion with the various nominees for
officers of the Association, members
of Alumni Council, etc., and also for
the purpose of introducing some of
our best known alumni workers to
the graduate and undergraduate body
generally, we have arranged to devote
between now and June some of the
valuable space alloted the Alumni
columns of THE WEEKLY to person-
al write ups of these gentlemen.

It has been our contention that in-
terest among the Alumni in these
elections and, as a result, in alumni
affairs generally, will be enhanced if
the rank and ﬁle of the Alumni Asso-
ciation are brought into a little closer
contact with those for whom the bal-
lots are cast. If every man who
is entitled to vote knew every
nominee personally——his characteris-
tics, capabilities, etc.—it would be an
ideal ‘situation. As that seems im-
possible owing to many of the nomi-
nees graduating years before some
voters attended the
vice versa, the next best plan appears
to be to acquaint the voters with the
nominees by publicity in these
columns. At Cornell University, a
Jmultigraphed history blank is sent
voters for each nominee when the bal-
lots are sent out. This is a very good
plan although the one we are following
seems just as good, at least, as it
serves the- double purpose of‘acquaint-
ing the voters with the men who have
been selected for the ballot, as well
as informing the undergraduates and
readers of the student and alumni pa-
per, in general, about the men who
are working, as graduates, to put
Old Pitt on the map.

It often occurs that a man may be
a loyal worker for his Alma Mater
and may be an ideal man for mem-
bership on Council. Circumstances
may be such, however, that he isn’t
particularly well known to the gener-
al list of voters and would not be able
to be elected for an office. For this
reason Council would lose a valuable
man. It was to overcome this ob-
jection principally that the Nominat-
ing Committee plan was adopted to
govern the annual election. That Com-

'mittee, which is composed of promin-

ent alumni representatives from the
nine schools, vouches for the ability
of any men put on the ballot. Any of
the men named by them are workers
and no mistake will be made by vot-
ing for any of them. For Council 31
men have been nominated, of which
25 are to be elected. After reading
the personal write ups of the candi-
dates, you should know pretty well
what 25 you want to vote for.

The Alumni Secretary wishes to
explain right here that he stands «re-
sponsible for this method of advising
the members of the Association, re-
garding the candidates and that the
nominees aren’t “playing politics.’’
The fact is that many have been re-
luctant to rush into print and it has
only been by the strongest kind‘ of
persuasion that we have been able to
get them to relent and furnish the de-
sired information.

Our eventual aim is to make the
Alumni Council a more efficient organ-
ization made up of snappy, aggresive
workers who have the time and en-
ergy to devote to boosting Pitt. The
Council was originally organized as
the WORKING BODY of the General
Alumni Association and that is what
we want to make it. ‘

Nqminees who haven’t sent in their
questionaires, with photographs, are
asked to mail at once as we want the
entire 31 for THE WEEKLY. Be-
tween now and election time-—June-—
we also hope to run photographs of
the nominees for officers of Council,
Honorary Vice Presidents, Alumni\
Representative on the - Board of
Trustees, etc. '

This is addressed specially to the
younger a1umn'i—the men .who have
graduated within the last ten years,
or so--although, of course everyone
is invited to participate. We feel that
it will appeal to the younger fellows
—those who have an hour at lunch
every day from, say, 12 to 1 o'clock,
and who would like to eat with a con-
genial bunch. of Pitt fellows whom
they know and where the tax is reas-
onable—-25 to 50 cents, or even less.

For the'last year or two, Miller’s
‘restaurant, on Smithﬁeld street, has
been a gathering place for the young-
er Pitt men. Usually, from six to
eight fellows lunch there and they
have a large table to gather around.
The rates are very reasonable and
would suit the pocketbook of even the
younger “grads” who are making
their ﬁrst attempt at the money-mak-
ing game and whoacan’t stand more
expensive lunching places. The pro-

  « IECH GAME

Pitt’s heavy artillery had no trouble
whatever in getting the range of the
Tech fortiﬁcations last Wednesday,
and the Blue and Gold athletes tired
themselves out chasing round the

bags, chalking up a grand total of 18

runs. All this while, Hart and Lang-
don were the 'fpr(i;7eI‘l1))l1aldenlgI&1aff0£
the wearers o t e ai an i i
hadn’t been for a ﬁt of niental aber-
ration on the part of “Ty” Engel-
hardt, which let in two counters, Tech
wouldn’t have put one_ across yet.
ﬂ From the 1’§i_i£i:ed“Jign(rin3;h Dcilfifart,
rst up or 1 ene e ci in
middle with a hbt shot, the Varsity
held the situation well in hand. Tech’s

scoring brought the Skibos within-

reach of Pitt at one stage, but Healy’s
followers came back with a ﬂock of
runs, and from then on the Carnegies
were lost. Hines, Ryan and Wean
were in turn sacriﬁced to the Pitt
Juggernaut, but, like Chinamen, they
all looked alike to the Varsity.

The ﬁrst chapter resulted in only
one score for Pitt, though three hits
were made.. A pair of tallies came
across in the second, but the third was
scoreless. In the fourth two runs
were dragged in by virtue of Hines’
wild and woolly throw over ﬁrst base,
and the total was raised to six in the
nextinning. From this point on the
carnage became frightful, twelve
juicy runs being added to the Pitt
collection in the last four rounds. In
the ninth inning, driven by pangs of
hun er, the Varsity representatives

E and swung at anything, in order
to get a start for supper.

. Tech’s only ray of hope came in the
third, which opened 'th Engelhardt’s
bobble on Lain’s sof ﬂy. Things
looked even more squally when Healy
adn Engelhardt got twisted in going
after Hines ﬂy, the result being two
men on and none out. Middle ﬁelder
Walt ‘anchored Doherty’s ﬂy, after
which McClure advanced the two run-
ners with a sacriﬁce, Hastings getting
the assist to Peck.- The clouds had
begun to break, with two strikes on
Dawson, the next hitter, but the Tech
man caught the next one and shot it
past DeHart to left ﬁeld. Dillon’s

throw to catch Hines, coming in from

second, passed Matson when the Tech
pitcher spilled the Pitt catcher on the
line. Healy, backing up the plate,
took the ball and threw to Hastings,
who caught Dawson sliding into sec-
ond, ending the inning.

The real ﬁreworks in the ﬁelding
line was contributed by Engelhardt
when, in the sixth, McClure started
one on the line for Oakland and points
west. Walt put on a few extra pounds
of steam and pursued the pellet for a
mile or so, ﬁnally reaching out and
taking it in over his shoulder. This
play got the biggest hand of the after-
noon. Engelhardt was also guilty of
the longest hit of the afternoon, trip-
ling to right in the eighth inning.

On‘ the whole, Pitt’s showing was
pleasing, though there were a few dis-
plays of ivory on the bases and in the
The hitting looked especially
good, the twenty-four safe bingles in-
cluding ten doubles and a three-bag-
ger. DeHart’s speed was largely com-
mented .on especially when the Kiski

FIRST coli
,TEAM‘WlN8
GREAT FAME

When the ﬁnal whistle trills out the
ending of the Margaret Morrison
game tomorrow evening the closing
note of the ﬁrst and singularly suc-
cessful season of the Pitt basketball‘
girls will be sounded.

From the very ﬁrst the girl’s team
has been a marvel in playing ability
and adeptness at scoring. This is
rendered the more remarkable by the
fact that the team was late in prefect-
ing its organization. The secret of
their success rests in the unbounded
enthusiasm of the individual players,
the expert and scientiﬁc coaching of
E. H. Landis, and the skilful manage-
ment of Miss Louise Moye, who suc-
ceeded in arranging a ﬁne schedule
despite the fact that the organization
began at a time when it was difﬁcult
to secure ﬂoor engagements.

Precluding the possibility of defeat
in the ﬁnal game tomorrow, the Blue
and Gold girls will have played thir-
teen games and have lost outof the
entire number but one. That one was
dropped to Fifth Avenue High early
in the season, before the team had
been fully blended into the °machine
which came through so magniﬁciently
in the latter part of the season and
literaly won the championship of
Western Pennsylvania on the home
stretch by dishing up a beating to the
Edgewood High School, the title hold-
er of the high schools of the section.
The worth of the Pitt aggragation
was proved beyond a doubt when they
humbled the Fifth Avenue sextet by
a score that completely set aside the
result of the earlier game. -

In the same manner that the Junior
Championship was gained, the College
sectional title was won by the victory
over Margaret Morrison late in the
season. The “Better Half” of Tech
had succeeded in wresting the super-

-iority from the other colleges of the

section but lost it to the Pitt six.

The games with the Margaret Mor-
rison School together with the con-
test with' Wilson College constitute
the only Varsity games played for in
all the other games the team played
under the title of the Pitt Freshmen.

The ﬁnal art of the season will be
the victory-celebrating banquet at the
Gym tomorrow night, when the girls’
sextet and ‘the boys’ Freshman team
together with their friends. will gather
to pay homage to the ﬂoor work of
the two ﬁrst-year teams during the
season just ﬁnished. On this occa-
sion the letters will be presented to
the members of the girls aggragation
but at present it is not exactly known
whether or not the letters will be at-
tached to sweaters. There is also a
rumor aﬂoat that the coeds will like-
wise be presented with a silver cup as
a mark of appreciation for their work
of the year.‘

Though the team was possessed of
the most excellent combination work
there were some of the members who
starred over their team mates. To
Miss Wehmeier belongs the stellar
honors of the season for beside play-
ing an astonishing game she made a
record at shooting fouls that all but
equaled that of Ben Lubic. Miss Weh-
meier’s record was closely seconded
by that of Miss Vohr, who was as-
signed the responsibility of the cap-
taincy. _

Meanwhile the members of the
team are looking forward to an ex-
ceedingly bright ﬁuture. The one dis-
turbing element in their rosy out-
look is the fact that the services of
Coach Landis may not be available to
the team of next year, and it was to
his expert and skilful coaching, more
than any other factor, that the suc-
cess of the team was due. Yet all the
members of this years team are ﬁrst
year people and it needs no very great
gift of foresight to predict that, be-
fore the next three years have be-
come history, Pitt will be gifted with
one of the most formidable girls’
basketball organizations in the coun-

McMaster against the world; or, as
Vergil once told us, contra mundum!
.._.0....

Hines, of Tech, was minus about
ﬁfty-ﬁve of his varities last Wednes-
day. His offerings were either good
or bad; the bad ones he couldn’t get
over the plate, and the good, ones he
couldn’t get past it »

...o.....

What we wan to know is this: If
Ochsenhirt’s team ‘holds the State
championship, and if the University
girls hold the Western Pennsylvania
title, who are th echampions of Pitt?

The next’ time Pitt sends any sort
of a team against Allegheny, we hope
they keep their ﬁngers crossed. This
Meadville jinx is getting to be some-
thing else than funny; it’s .an odd
sense of humor that can appreciate
that 2-1 blow last Saturday. Still, as
Mrs. Noah saidgtother husband, “The
rain will be‘ a good thing for the
crops.” ~ , .

Tech students must be accustomed
to early supper, judging by the num-
bers of them that left the game last
Wednesday after Pitt became pernic-
iously active. Varsity rooters stuck it
out longer; perhaps the ﬁfty cents
admission’ fee made‘ it the part of
economyto stay to the end.

Those unbeatable feminists have
been awarded a silver cup by the Ath-
letic Committee for their clever work
on the basketball ﬂoor during the past
season. The Committee was quite al-
truistic in its motives, too; there’s
hardly a single man among them.

 

EASTERN JOURNEY
HARD TEST FOR -PITT.

 

On Sunday morning the Varsity
nine leaves for the annual Eastern
invasion. The trip includes a game
with Mt, ‘St. Marys, at Emmitsburg,
Md., on Monday, the next one on Tues-
day with Princeton University, and
the last engagement with the ‘sailors
at Annapolis on Wednesday. Of these
three, Princeton and the Navy have
very strong ‘ teams on the diamond
this year. However, the Varsity has
been practicing hard all week, inorder
to ﬁx up the weak spots that were
noticeable at Meadville. The team
has real ability and these three games
in a row will tax this ability to the
utmost. .

-The same line-up as ‘has been used
in the ﬁrst two games will probably
be «used -in this trip. The twirling de-
partmentis giving Coach Wilson a
little trouble, as playing three such
hard games in as many days will pre-
vent the using of. the same pitcher
twice. Kennedy wil probably open the
game against Mt. St. Marys Monday.
Langdon will be saved for the Tigers
on Tuesday. He pitched a good game
against them last year, but lost out
on errors. “Al” Hart will face the
Navy on Wednesday. Twelve men will
be taken along on the trip. Besides
the pitchers DeHart, Captain Healey,

NEW IEAGUE
FORMED IN
    BASKETBALL

‘ Three big home games will be
added to Pitt’s basketball schedule
next winter by the reorganization of
th e Pennsylvania Intercollegiate
Basketball League, which accurred in
Philadelphia last Friday night.
Plans~for the new league call for
an organization of six teams, to be
decided upon by the Executive Com-
mittee of the League. In all likeli-

hood these six will be Lehigh, Lafay-

ette and Swarthmore from the East,
and State, W. & J., and Pitt from the
West. It is possible that either Sus-
quehanna or Gettysburg will be given
one of the places in the new body. '

Each member of the league will be

I called upon to meet every other mem-

ber twice during the season, at_home
and abroad. This will do much to
stimulate basketball interest, bringing
the eastern teams to this section and
taking the western ﬁves to the other
end of the state. This will eliminate
the post-season games which have
been a feature of other years, but the
net result will be beneﬁcial to the
whole league. Playing dates will be
announced just as soon as arrange-
mentsrran be completed.

The sectional winners in the season

HELAYTEAM
TAKES THIRD
m PENN MEET

Pitt’s relay team, consisting of
Burwell, Cook, Grumbling, and Mays,‘

won third place in the\one-mile college’

relay at the annual’ intercollegiate
track meet held at the University of
Pennsylvania last Saturday. The
meet was marked by the exceptionally
fast time in all the events and several
records were_broken. Pitt’s men run-
ning against the star relay team of
State, showed up remarkably well
well. The time made in this event
was the third best made in any of the
The Quakers in their event
ran the mile_ in the record-breaking
tiem of 3 minutes 18 seconds, break-
ing the world’s record fbr that dis-
tance. In Pitt’s class Penn State
running true to‘ form took ﬁrst, and
Swarthmore second, with Pitt right
behind them.

Cook was on the start for Pitt. At
the end of the ﬁrst quarter White of
Penn State was leading the ﬁeld by
about eight yards, with the Swarth-
more and Pitt men running neck and
-neck. Mays then took up the. race for
the Blue and Gold and by a ﬁne exhi-
bition of running gained a few yards

, on Post, who ran second for the

Center County boys. Mason was too

much for

yards in the rear. By a wonderful
burst of speed he came to within a
yard of the Swarthmore man and only
a few yards behind Dolbin, State’s
star man. The race was one of the
closest events run and the time 3:29
1-5 is quite good.

The time made by the team aver-
aged about 53 seconds. Biurwell made
the distance in the best time when he
traveled the quarter in 51 3-5 seconds.
Cook was second, making itin 53 1-5.’
Mays and Grumbling each covered the
distance in 53 3-5. This is the fastest
time made by a University relay team
in any of the Penn meets. All the
men who ran Saturday will be in
school next year. .

McMaster was entered in the pole-

vault, but tired out by his exertions.

of the day before in the pentathlon,
he dropped at eleven feet. His record
for this event, 12 feet 3'inches would
haveﬁtaken second place in the event
this year. However, it was thought
best not to take any chances.

and Pitt—were awarded each a trophy
in the shape of a large silver basket-
ball. 1 In addition, Pitt received a large
cup symbolic of the state champion-
ship, won by the victory over Swarth-
more. .

The University was represented at
this meeting by Downing,
basketball manager for the 1915 seas-
on. Mr. Downing was elected a mem-
ber of the Executive Committee of the
League, together with Ray Smith, of
State College, Chairman, and E. C.
Hummell, of Lehigh, Secretary-Treas-
urer.

Pitt’s track prospects suifered a
severe blow this week when it was an-
nounced that Stanley L. Scott, ’I6,
captain and crack hurdler, would be
unable to compete on the cinder path
this season. The blow is all the hard-
er because of the fact that the Syra-
cuse meet is but a few days off, with
other meets each week until the end
of the year, in which Scott would be
almost invaluable to the team. '

Scott has been ill all winter,'so that
the announcement is not a complete
surprise; but it had been hoped all
along that he might get into shape for
competition. The last examination
disclosed the fact that “Ike” was in

spring, and he was ﬁnally ruled out.
Whether he will be able to come back
next year is an open question, with
every Pitt man rooting on the affirm-
ative side. ’

Until two years ago Scott had never
gone over a hurdle; but since enter-
ing Pitt his development has been
rapid, and last spring he broke lo ig-
standing records in both the low and
the high hurdles. The 120-yard record
was twice broken, being brought down
ﬁnally to 15 4-5 seconds. The longer
distance Scott negotiated in 25 ﬂat.

er reduce these marks, but this is all
off for at least a year.

In the situation, it will be neceslsariy
to elect a man to Scott 5 place as ea -
er of the track squad. As yet, no can-
didates are actively in the ﬁeld, though

The election will be held within a few

days, deﬁnite announcement to

to every old graduate, the «name of '

Frost at once calls. (up the". memory
of that guardian of his college days,
who was far better Iknown as
“Mother.” In those days, not only
the name was known, but also the
habits and characteristics of each in-
dividual student. His work was ever
of a veryxconscientious nature-,. and
many .a man still cherishes a paper
covered with red ink characters and
