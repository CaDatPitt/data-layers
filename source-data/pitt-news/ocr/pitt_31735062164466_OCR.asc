Proposed Ellwo od City
Campus Dropped at
Education Board Vote

The University is abiding by the State Board of Edu-
cation’s decision to let Pennsylvania State University es-
tablish a “Commonwealth Campus” in Beaver County, there-
by abandoning its plans to build a campus in neighboring
Ellwood City. _

In response to requests from citizens’ groups, the Uni-
versity had agreed to erect a branch in Ellwood City, which
is located in Lawrence County. Penn State had been .approached by
the county commissioners of adjacent Beaver County to establish a

campus in Monaca. The State Board ruled that it. could not approve

both requests. V

Commenting on the decision that was reached, Joseph G. Colan-
gelo, Jr., director of Public Relations, remarked that University was
disappointed in the respect that citizens’ groups had made a concen-
trated effort to raise money in preparation for the branch in Ellwood
City and ﬁnancial committments had already been made.

The decision of the State Board was the culmination of the testi-
monies of the State Council of Education, which had created the idea
that the University and Penn State were directly contesting one an-
other for the right to establish .a campus in the Lawrence-Beaver
County area. '

In response to his belief, Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld held
.a press conference at which time he emphasized that “there is no
competition between Pitt and Penn State” in the establishment of
regional campuses. He added, “It is the very deﬁnite policy of this
institution that there be no competition. The state cannot afford it.
We have two few resources for it.”

The Chancellor also pointed out at that time that the University
has established branches only in those areas where its .aid was re-
quested by local leaders, where there was a clear need, and where
feasibility studies indicated that such a campus would be self-sup-.
porting.

Crriffin Speaks at Midday

Coffee Hour on Experience

' The University is offer-
ing 64 more courses in the
spring trimester of 1964-65
than it did in 1963-64.
Spring trimester enroll-
ment is about half that of

the ﬁrst two trimesters so‘

the entire range of courses is not
offered. The Dean of the School
of the Liber.al Arts, the Deans
and Department Chairmen of the
three Divisions, the Office of Stu-
dent Records, and the Office of
the Vice Chancellor of the Aca-
demic Disciplines plan the sched-

, ule of courses according to cur.

ricular patterns, graduate pro-
grams, previous student election,
potential conﬂicts of courses and
availability of faculty.

This spring 472 courses are of-
fered in comparison to the 408
given during the last spring tri-
mester. The greatest increase
next trimester is on the grad-
uate level (numbered 200-299)
where 54 additional classes are
planned. Last year’s spring tri-
mester offered 133 courses while
this spring there will be 187.
Also added are subjects on the
upperclass (100-199) and night
underclass (700-799) level. The
former has ten and the latter 11
more offerings,

Underclass courses (0-99) de-
creased from 113 to 112 _.and up-
perclass night courses (800-899)
fell from 37 to 27.

show a full understanding of the
role. I

The only example of poor pro-
duction technique that was really
garing occured during the ﬁrst
act during the duet in which Al-
fredo was oﬂ’-stage, Dr. Karp, the
conductor, -who is usually known
for his musical horsesense had
Romani sing through the loud-
speaker system. The effect could
have been catastrophic, though
fortunately it was only unpleas-
ant. -

The man who really stole the
laurels for the evenings’ perfor-
mances was Manuel Ausensi, Mex-
ican baritone, who played Ger-
‘mont. Ausensi, the possessor of
a ﬁne voice used it as only a

master would. His Germont was-

a forceful interpretation which at
-no point ceased to be lyrical.
The secondary characters were
simply routine except for the
notable exception of Anne Strauss
in the role of Ammia. Hers was
the perfect maid and it is a tri-
bute to Miss Strauss that she was
able to bring a character to a
role that is usuallyla shadow.

the dance went to

After an excellent start the
opera steadily improved. Act II
was ﬂawless. Act III was a _wel-
come change from what so many
times is only just so much loud
singing by three principals and
chorus; it~\had true dr.amatic im-
pact. I _ _

It was Act IV, however, that
.was exceptionally well done.
However, I’m afraid only a hand-
ful of the audience were able to
hear it. One person put it -very
well. “There was more consump-
tion in the audience,” he said-,
“than there was on the stage!”
They ‘were competing with New
York for “Worst Audience in the
World” title.

Dr. Karp is an excellent con-
ductor. However, there were

. times (during the Last act parti-

cularly) when a good healthy
“Shut up!!!” would have done
more than an equally healthy
downbeat. Fortunately, however,
thepoor manners in the audi-
ence did not creep over the foot-
lights onto the stage. Every one
sang together and in the same

. key.

William and Mary last Saturday.
The leading rebounder in that
game was Bob Lovett who only
pulled down ﬁve rebounds.
Lovett had been leading the
team in rebounds averaging ‘close
to ten a game and also in points
-1.. per game with a 16 point aver-
age. In the last ﬁve games, how-
ever, he has been Way below par

cause we need his scoring and he
can hit from ‘anywhere on the

If Lovett has regressed since
the season has started Larry
Szykowny has begun to show
Signs of becoming steadier and
more consistent on the court. “He
played one of his best games of
the season both offensively and
defensively,” said Timmons, “and
he is important also in our scor-
ing potentia .”

Throughout the season the Pan-
thers have been having trouble
not only with rebounding but
with defensive play. “They don't
have the experience that last
years team had and they can’t
play the aggressive type man to

Timmons has changed his tact-

We slow down the other teams
