Nicaragua invades Honduras

By Merrill Hartson

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON — President
Reagan said Wednesday that
Nicaraguan troops had attacked
Contra rebel positions in neigh-
boring Honduras and his spokes-
man said the United States was
considering ”everything  short
of invasion" in response.

The White House said the
president of Honduras, Jose Az-
cona, asked for American as-
sistance in trying to repel, the
Nicaraguan forces, but White
House spokesman Marlin Fitz-
water said he could not say
whether that request included a
plea for military help.

The Honduran ambassador put ’

the number of Nicaraguan troops
in his country as in the thousands.
Nicaragua, which at first said
there had been no invasion,
Wednesday said it was "looking
into the reports."

Reagan, asked whether he was
considering any use of U.S. mili-
tary forces, replied, ”We’ve been
in consultation with the Hondu-
ran government but I can't com-
ment on anything.”

He said that ”the information
we have is that Nicaragua has
crossed the border into Hon-
duras. Obviously we're con-
cerned.”

Speaking separately, the Hon-
duran ambassador, Roberto Mar-
tinez, said that here a had been
a ”penetration into Honduran ter-

troops.”

He said his government hoped
to avoid military action.

of state and others ”have con-

The 1988 University of Pitts-
burgh Honors Convocation
was conducted yesterday at
the Carnegie Music Hall.

This year, honors were con-
ferred on 717 students who
represented the top 2 percent
of their respective schools. A
total of 176 faculty members
received honors, 15 of which
were the bestowment of
emeriti appointments. In addi-
tion, 390 other awards were
given, including post doctoral,
Omicron Delta Kappa and
seven distinguished teacher's
awards.

Also, 80 high school honors
students from 23 different high
schools were recognized for
their academic achievments.

Reverend George Appleyard
administered the invocation,
followed by the greeting from
Pitt President Wesley Posvar.

”Today, we honor students
who have displayed academ-
ic excellence,” said Posvar.
”We also focus special atten-
tion on our faculty.

”This convocation is a
[reaffirmation of] the values
and principles of our universi-
ty as a concept,” Posvar ad-
ded. ”A university is a
sanctuary for ideas, whether

Pitt faculty and
students honored

they are strange or unusual.
We teach and learn because
we have an innate desire to
further knowledge.”

Posvar went on to say that
”we are 201 years old, a force
for wisdom as we head into
our third century. Within a
mile from here are supercom-
puters and museums and phy-
sicians striving to extend life.
We have a special responsibil-
ity to the community.”

Undergraduate academic
honors were given by Provost
Rudolph Weingartner, who
said, ”This is a continuation of
a tradition that has gone on
since 1385 in Heidelberg, and
before that in Paris, Oxford
and Bologna.”

Undergraduate Bonnie
Kartzman was awarded the
Chancellor's Scholarship and
the J. Steele Gow Congression-
al Internship.

The presentation of graduate
and professional honors was
given by Thomas Detre, senior
vice president of health
sciences.

The Emma W. Locke Award
went to Michael J. Murawski
for recognition of high scholar-
ship, and this year's Omicron
Delta Kappa ”Senior of the
Year” Award went to Sharon

invasion of Honduran territory.”

Fitzwater did not spell out what
options were being considered.

Fitzwater said Secretary of State
George Shultz, national security
adviser Colin Powell and White
House chief of staff Howard H.
Baker Jr., were being dispatched
to Capitol Hill to brief congres-
sional leaders.

House Speaker Jim Wright said
he could not immediately evalu-
ate reports that Sandinista troops
had crossed into Honduras.

Wright said he still does not be-
lieve support exists in Congress
for any kind of renewed military
aid for the rebels, and repeated
that congressional Democrats re-
main willing to talk about a fur-

ther package of purely
”humanitarian" aid.
Fitzwater said that 1,500

Nicaraguan troops were inside
Hondruas and that an additional
4,500 appeared to be in a stag-
ing area to cross the border.

Fitzwater told reporters that
’’all options are under consider-
ation. At this moment, everything
is being considered short of (U.S.)
invasion."

Symposium
looks at a
future, free

South Africa

By Mark R. Brown
Staff Writer

A three-day symposium on the
subject of a future South Africa,
after apartheid has been
abolished, begins today.

Sponsored by the University of
Pittsburgh and organized by Den-
nis Brutus, chairperson of the
Department of Black Communi-
ty Education Research and De-
velopment, the symposium,
according to Brutus, ”is the third
in a series of symposiums, the
climax.

”We’re looking at South Afri-
ca after racist apartheid is disman-
tled,” said Brutus. ”We’re
anticipating what form their soci-
ety will take and how their con-
stitution and economy will
develop.

”But we're not dictating what
will happen,” he added. ”We're
interested in a free, democratic
South Africa."

Brutus was imprisoned with

Library of
discussed

By Brendan Kevenides
Staff Writer

Librarian of Congress Dr. James
H. Billington kicked offa nation-
wide series of forums to chart the
future course of the Library of
Congress yesterday at the Car-
negie Library of Pittsburgh.

The purpose of the forums is to
search for the best ways in which
the Library of Congress can best
serve and relate to branch
libraries throughout the country
by the year 2000, when it will
celebrate its 200th anniversary,
according to Billington.

The library serves both the
government and the public, ex-
plained Billington, and it is uncer-
tain which course should be
followed to serve both sectors
adequately. ,

”We’re subsidized by the tax-
payers, but it is uncertain as to
whom we should serve,” said Bil-

Congress
at forum

lington.

He also said that he is uncer-
tain what the role of the Librari-
an of Congress should be in this
attempt. Billington said that the
creation of a leadership position
to guide the ”complex network”
of libraries has yet to be worked
out.

”How can you exercise leader-
ship if you can't exercise con-
trol?” he concluded.

Billington said that the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh could be affect-
ed by a reformation in at least
three ways. The ”most impor-
tant" advance that may be made
available to students is through
installing databases throughout
campus with which one could
simply plug directly into
resources available at the Library
of Congress via an 800 number.

Reagan remarks:

WASHINGTON — In a remark
he immediately regretted, Presi-
dent Reagan on Wednesday said
he sometimes doesn't tell Con-
gress everything it wants to know.

The subject arose when Reagan
was asked about his former na-
tional security advisor, Robert
McFarIane, who pleaded guilty
last week to four misdemeanor
counts of withholding informa-
tion from Congress.

”He just pleaded guilty to not
telling Congress everything it
wanted to know. I've done that
myself," Reagan said, responding
to reporters’ questions during a
photo-taking session in the Oval
Office with Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir.

He immediately told reporters,
”Now don't distort that. No. I just
mean  I just think Congress
would like to be asking questions
about almost anything, anytime.”

Trying to cut off the conversa-
tion, Reagan said, ”This is in the
courts. Let's wait and determine
whether they say the law has
been broken."

As reporters were escorted

from the room, Reagan turned to
Shamir and said in a whisper:

”Oh boy. Just for that careless
remark  they'll go wild about
Reagan wants to lie to Congress
or something.”

The remark was picked up by
a microphone.

U.S. hostage Anderson
honored at ceremony

LORAIN, Ohio — A small
group of people dedicated to Ter-
ry Anderson’s release from cap-
tivity in Lebanon Wednesday
hoisted an American flag and tied
a yellow ribbon to the flag pole
at City Hall.

The ceremony marked the third
anniversary of the capture of An-
derson, who was born in Lorain
and spent the first seven years of
his life in this northern Ohio city.

Anderson, 40, chief Middle
East correspondent for The As-
sociated Press, was abducted
March 16, 1985. He is the
longest-held of 22 foreign
hostages in Lebanon. There has
been no word of him for three

months.

A dozen people, including
some of Anderson's relatives, at-
tended the ceremony in cold, dry
weather.

Jack LaVriha, chairman of the
town's Free Terry Anderson Com-
mittee, spoke briefly and accused
the Reagan administration of
dragging its feet and doing little
on behalf of Anderson and other
hostages in Lebanon.

Gwen Jones, Anderson's aunt,
said after the ceremony that the
family is ”finding it very hard and
frustrating.”

Man offers 10 grand
to cure his hiccups

MINNEAPOLIS — A 94-year-
old man's offer of $10,000 to

otic nostrums —- dill seed, mag-
nesium phosphate, holy water

and Indian hemp, among them —
but the man hiccups on.

”Unbelievable,” Lucretia
Peterson of rural Aitkin said as
she sifted through some of the
more than 5,000 letters, cassettes,
and parcels that have poured into
her home from Europe and North
America since her father, Charlie
Osborne, offered the reward in
January.

”People really care. Even
though the $10,000 is a big deal
to some of them, a lot say keep
the money and spend it in good
health. It's unbelievable for that
many people to write in this day
and age,” she said.

Suggested remedies have
ranged from homespun concoc-
tions involving sugar and vinegar
to scientific nerve-treatment regi-
mens complete with detailed di-
agrams. Others endorse the
healing powers of the mind.

A Santa Monica, Calif., mas-
sage therapist explained how she
cured a 75-year-old woman of a
life—long burping problem and
offered to work similar magic on
Osborne.

’Brother Dan’ church *0

is safe from seizure

PITTSBURGH — A federal jury
deliberated Wednesday on a
punishment for a Pittsburgh evan-
gelist convicted in a $5 million
fraud scheme, but his church is
safe from seizure no matter what
the penalty.

Jury deliberations began Tues-
day after U.S. Districtludge Alan

Bloch ruled that only cash or.

bank accounts could be taken,
not the suburban Pittsburgh
Revival Center developed by
Daniel R. ”Brother Dan” Of-
chinick.

Ofchinick, his son, Daniel R.
Ofchinick Jr., and four others
were found guilty Monday of 58
counts of fraud. Prosecutors said
they defrauded Mack Financial
Services through bogus truck
financing.

Pitt budget request much higher than Casey proposal

‘ By Mindy Boffemmyer

Staff Writer

Governor Robert Casey's 1989
budget proposal for Pitt and other
higher educational institutions
has received criticism from the
Common Research Universities
(Pitt, Penn State and Temple), Pitt
officials and state legislators, in-
cluding members of Casey's own

Q Democratic Party.

Casey's budget proposes a 4
percent increase in subsidies to
Pitt, but the actual increase is
only 2.1 percent due to a $2 mil-
lion cut fr()m Pitt’s Applied
Research Center, which is also a
part of Casey's budget proposal.

The budget request Pitt sub-
inittted calls for at least a 10 per-
cent increase in operating funds
in order to keep tuition rates
down against inflation. ()ne of
the assumptions of Pitt's proposal
is that there will be no tuition in-
crease in 1989, but Pitt President
Wesley Posvar warned that an in-
crease in tuition by 10 percent or
more may be necessary if Casey's
budget is passed by state legis-
lature.

Pitt is requesting state funds
totaling $128,914,000 for the
1989 fiscal year, a 20.1 percent
increase over the 1988 budget.
The proposal includes a base
budget of $1 .2 million and an ad-
ditional $5.7 million for high-tech
programs.

The two largest budget expen-
ditures proposed by the universi-
ty are for instructional purposes
($136,621,000) and research pro-
grams ($74,681,000).

 
     
   

One of the goals stated in Pitt's
budget proposal is to promote
economic development. Pitt offi-
cials object to Casey's proposal to
cut $2 million from U-PARC be-
cause it has created nearly 300
jobs during its two years in
operation.

Pitt employs more than 20,000
people, and Pitt's proposal in-
cludes a 7 percent increase in
employee salaries in order to
compete with the Association of
American Universities for quali-
ty faculty and staff members. Pitt
faculty salaries have declined in
relation to the other AAU univer-
sities over the past seven years.

According to Pitt's budget
presentation, state support has
not been available to meet the
needs of repairs and maintenance
of state-owned buildings, the
renewal of laboratory facilities
and the replacement of academ-
ic instrumentation.

In each of the previous two
years, the state provided special
funding of over $1 million to up-
grade laboratory and scientific
equipment for undergraduate
education at Pitt. More money is
needed to continue the upgrad-
ing process; however, no funds
were provided for this purpose
for fiscal year 1989.

It is estimated in Pitt's proposal
that to provide a state-of—the-art
scientific environment, the
university must spend in excess
of $20 million over the next five

years.

In fiscal year 1985, Pitt ranked
28th among all colleges and
universities nationally in federal

After Illinois, it is
all an uphill battle

At long last, the 1988 presidential campaign is beginning to

take on some shape. Illinois, whose primary went pretty much

as expected -— Bush running away with the Republican vote
and Simon and Jackson competing for the Democratic -— proved
to be the turning point for a number of reasons.

Among the Democrats, Gephardt needed at least a showing
to remain a serious contender, and Gore, popular on Super
Tuesday, spent nearly $250,000 on television ads that added
up to nothing. Both candidates received less than 10 percent
of the popular vote and no delegates. Dukakis, the previously
acknowledged front-runner, also received no delegates.

For the Republicans, Bush's decisive victory came as no sur-
prise. After his Shermanesque march through the South, Bush
was practically a shoo-in. With 771 of the 1,139 delegates need-
ed to secure the nomination, Bush has spoken already of shap-
ing a campaign for the November elections. Dole, with 181
delegates, has only a slim chance of overtaking Bush. The other
Republican contender, Robertson, received only 7 percent of
the popular vote in Illinois and no delegates, and has begun
to speak of the 1992 election.

Barring a distasteful disclosure from the Noriega affair or from
the ongoing investigations by Lawrence Walsh into the arms-
for-hostages-for-money—for-Contras scandal, Bush can expect to
see his name on the bumpers of Republican autos. Dole,
.although he had stated a desire to remain in the race until the
convention, said Tuesday that he would ”consult friends” about
the possibility of dropping out.

In left field, the picture, though coming into focus, is far from
complete. None of the candidates currently has sufficient
delegates to be assured of the nomination. Should the current
trend of erratic wins in the primaries continue, Atlanta promises
to bear a striking resemblance to Wall Street. The brokers with
the most delegates will negotiate for the nominee.

For the Democrats as a party, failure to come into the con-
vention with a clear-cut nominee would seem to spell almost
certain defeat. Most of the current criticism of the party is that
it is factioned, and that the factions together fail to produce a
candidate who can win.

Happily, the largest states and the biggest contests are still
to come. Pennsylvania, New York, California and Michigan,
states with much less predictable voters than the southern and
mid-western states, will contribute a large portion of the
delegates and an even larger portion of the winning image. A
clear victory in one of the larger states would go a long way
toward influencing remaining voters.

In a nutshell

realm, the knower of all the secret ways and the words

Log huts and hog gluts

The executive parking lot locat-
ed between the Cathedral of
Learning and President Posvar’s
favorite symbol of frugality and
scholarship -- namely, the log
cabin — has been completed.
This new parking area, which
desecrates about one half acre of
some of the most precious
ground in Oakland with a two-
inch layer of asphalt, stands as a
symbol of the selfish, unaccount-
able and arrogant administrators
who sit in the Cathedral and de-
termine how the precious re-
sources of this great university
will be squandered.

The parking lot cost more than
$100,000, the equivalent of
about 40 undergraduate tuitions
or the combined research bud-
gets of the French and English
departments for the next 20
years.

The reader might recall that five
years ago, for the want of
$60,000, President Posvar dis-
solved the geography de-
partment.

In asking not what they can do
for the campus but what the
university can do for them, these
grand poobahs of the University
of Pittsburgh have answered by
constructing this asphalt abortion
that will accomodate no more
than 15 BMWs, Mercedes or
Lincolns.

Several months ago, in
response to questions from the
faculty about the wisdom of con-
structing the executive parking
lot, the administration lied to us;
they informed us in campus pub-
lications that the parking spaces
would be used by visitors. The
truth is that only three of the
spaces have been set aside for vis-

itors; the other one dozen spaces .

are guarded by a gate through
which only ”carded” drivers can
pass. It wouldn't be a difficult task
to list the names of the uncon-
scionable walruses who will hold
the passes to these executive
parking spaces.

The Cathedral parking lot is a
symbol of the degree to which
President Posvar and his courti-
ers are out of touch with reality.
While the administrators of this
university appeal to Governor
Casey for an enormous increase
in state support, they either waste

LETTERS

or let pass through their hands
millions of dollars.

It is time for the trustees to say
to President Posvar: no more ex-
ecutive parking lots! Better yet, it
is time they dropped the presi-
dent in a blue and gold parachute
into the Great Executive Pasture.
And while they are about the task
of cleaning the Augean stables,
the trustees should entertain the
idea of dispatching some gray-
haired administrators to the land
of caribou and moose.

How entertaining it is to watch
Posvar’s aides de camp bolt to
the Cathedral from their autos in
the executive parking lot; the
ones I have seen have the appear-
ance and demeanor of men
sneaking out the back of a whore
house. And so they should! They
deserve the scam and ridicule of
all those who cherish and respect
this university and who under-
stand how important it is for us
to provide quality higher educa-
tion to as many people as possi-
ble in the Pittsburgh area.

Olympic obfuscation

Editor's note: The following
letter was sent to the late Naked
City. It is printed here instead.

Isn't it a shame that the Winter
Olympics are over? At least there
were some good stories to come
out of the games. For instance:

The United States hockey
team's all offense/no defense ap-
proach to their games. Sort of
reminiscent of the San Diego
Chargers’ or Miami Dolphins’ ap-
proach to football. Needless to
say, they didn't make post-season
play either.

Elizabeth Manley's perfect
long-program routine in figure
skating was a spectacle to see.
Yet, Miss Witt’s flirtatious but
hardly impressive routine got her
the gold. I guess there are some
things even a coach can't teach
you; you just have to learn it on

the streets.

Rodeo was a demonstration
sport in Calgary. I can't wait for
the summer games and tadpole
catching.

Once again, the Soviet Union
more than surpassed the medal
total of the United States. It goes
to show you that government-
supported athletes will always do
better, or is that blood-doped ath-
letes will always do better?

I think I will close now, so I
[can] practice my tadpole catch-
ing. [...]

A vote of non-support_____

Please allow me the opportuni-
ty, as an alumnus of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh and a fellow of
the Republican persuasion, to ex-
press my outrage and contempt
for the activities of Pitt's College
Republicans in opposing the in-
clusion of a sexual-orientation
clause to the university's Equal
Opportunity Statement [The Pitt
News, Feb. 23].

It's bad enough mainstream
Republicans must tolerate this
sort of narrow-minded thinking in
the National Review; there is ab-
solutely no place for it in a cam-
pus organization.

The discrimination is real, and
it must stop. Jeers to Roan Con-
fer and Kyle Bates for their un-
warranted screechings about
quotas. Cheers to Joel Rapoport,
GALA and the 5GB for support-
ing a measure whose time has
come. I urge Republicans and
Democrats alike to support GALA
and the 5GB on this one.

Since I'm by no means at
liberty to grant rhetorical amnesty
to those of us who have commit-
ted crimes of verbal crucifixion,

‘Can only try my best to be for-

giving.

Looks like a certain Pompous
Pilot should prepare to steer his
astro—ship clear of the female
population of the world. Houston
Astros pitcher Bob Knepper must
have mistakenly slipped a little
vaseline on one of his feet be-
cause it slid into his mouth real
well when he said that women
shouldn't do certain things be-
cause God doesn't want them to.

Now, I don't want to pick on
God here, so considering that
Knepper knows firsthand what
God wants, I'll pick on him. I sup-
pose even God has to go out
drinking with the boys once in a
while, which is when I figure he
sat Knepper down to set the
record straight.

Knepper said that the first and
only female pro umpire, 33-year-
old Pam Postema, does a ”great"
job. But, Knepper said, in God's
society, women shouldn’t be um-
pires, and that in general, wom-
en shouldn't be in leadership
positions because they're sup-
posed to be ”submissive" to their
husbands.

The first question that came to
my mind was how much the
dues are to belong to God's soci-

ety. Knepper should start saving
his money (or pray for pennies
from heaven, which might make
more sense considering that he
can count God amongst his cro-
nies) so that he can maintain a
lifetime membership, being that
he's lost about a yard and a half
on his fastball and his knuckler
doesn't move anymore.

As someone who is expected
to be a submissive, inferior mem-
ber of the human race, maybe I
should pay greater heed to the
ramblings of Knepper. Maybe he
does have a point. A pointed
head, that is. But we have to
remember that even pinheads
can go around bursting other
peoples’ bubbles.

WALKING BY MOONLIGHT

After two weeks of delibera-
tion, I settled on this title because
it describes one of my favorite
pastimes, and it describes what I
attempt to do in, these columns.

Moonlight allows one to see
everyday objects and scenes in a
different way; shadows are differ-

.ent, buildings and trees are differ-

ent, and in seeing them in the
light ofa full moon, one can bet-
ter appreciate these things as they
are in the day-to-day. It's all a
matter of perspective.

Normalcy gets boring after a
while, but in a different light, me
excitement comes back. Hokey,
I know, but true.

It will be spring on Sunday. As
I write this, it's still snowing. But
even through the snow and cold,
it will still be spring on Sunday.

I spent this afternoon thinking
about the coming spring, and
figuring out how many geraniums
I will need to fill my window box-
es come May.

Thinking about geraniums
made me think of summer, and
summer makes me think of vaca-
tions, especially August vacations
with my brothers in the glory of
the Canadian woodlands.

I ‘got so excited as I remem-
bered my Canadian experiences
that I went into my bedroom and
found my maple-leaf lapel pin
and affixed it to my shirt.

I bought that pin during the
same summer when I saw the

PAUL ANATER

Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights)
for the first time, which brings me
back to my original point of see-
ing things from a different per-
spective.

In August, it will have been
three years since I first saw the
Aurora.

I had spent most of that day out
on the lake with my brothers,
trolling for Northern Pike. I don't

~ remember if we caught anything

that day or not; it really doesn't
matter.

At dusk, we stopped fishing
and headed for home. In Ontario,
the mosquitos get really bad just
as the sun goes down, and we
thought it best to be ashore be-
fore their arrival.

As the sun set, we noticed that
the sky was filled with gray
streaks. "What's wrong with the
sky?" we thought.

We got back home, cracked a
few Molsons and recounted the
day's fishing stories.

I walked out to the fire pit and
started the night's fire.

I sat there, slapping mosquitos
and staring at the streaks in the
dusky sky.

As darkness fell, the streaks re-
mained and started to move.

By the time the sun had com-
pletely set, the streaks were no
longer gray, but pink, purple and
blue.

It's so hard to describe how
they looked. It's even harder to

Pam Postema has been booed,
spat on and called a whore be-
cause of her job, and she's still in
A-I shape, so I doubt if she real-
ly cares what Knepper says.

The male-dominated arena of
sports has particularly been an
area off-limits to women. While
there are a lot of men who don't
care one way or the other if a fe-
male sports reporter wants to
come in the locker room for post-
game interviews, there remain
many who do. That's fine.
There's nothing wrong with a
man not wanting a woman to see
him in the buff, but it's different
when he doesn't want her there
because he doesn't think she can
possibly comprehend sports.

Knepper is entitled to his
views, warped as they may be.
He probably thinks bigamy is OK
too —— as long as you're a man.
On second thought, a harem
might be more in order for a guy
like Knepper.

But any man who would sub-
scribe to such an opinion, in my
opinion (if I may be so honored
to give it), should be forced to un-
dergo an irreversible sex change
operation and then marry a man
exactly like him/herself.

Perhaps Bob should start using
the pin on his head and learn a
little needlepoint.

new era

describe how I felt as I watched
the sky turn into a neon am-
phitheater.

Shafts of flourescent color leapt
across the sky. These shafts were
coming out of a black rectangle
directly above me. They turned
and changed color endlessly
while tongues of shimmering
blue-green flames clung to the
horizon.

The loon-call soundtrack made
it complete.

In Norse mythology, the
Aurora Borealis was believed to
be the souls of fallen warriors be-
ing carried to heaven by the
Valkyries. In modern science, it
is known to be particles passing

belts.

Who cares about explanations?
The sight of the Aurora is as mys-
tifying as it is humbling. People
have seen what I saw on that cool
night since the dawn of man. In
the light of one of the master-
pieces of the universe, my life
seemed to be inconsequential.
Yet at the same time, the fact that
I was seeing something few peo-
ple ever have made me feel im-
portant.

Whenever I look into a night
sky, I search for signs of the
Aurora and remember.

Everybody’s seen the sky more
times than can be remembered,
but when it's seen in a different
light, such as with the Aurora, it
will never be the same again.

That's the point of ‘Walking by
Moonlight. If you look hard
enough at the everyday, you're
bound to see something spec-
tacular.

A sneak preview
of their methods

Mike Dukakis and Jesse
Jackson. The manager and
the messenger. The man
with the campaign and the
man with the charisma.

We have two proven na-
tional candidates now, two
Democrats with the politi-
cal legs to take them from
|()wa to Atlanta to Illinois.
And it turns out that they're
as distant on the political
spectrum as they can get.

Jackson, a day late and a
dollar short, has become a

. 
classic example of how far

GOODMAN
you can get in this country  

with a strong pitch to values, and an ability to bond with voters.
Dukakis, aversive to emotion and weak on message, has be-
come a classic exampel of how far you can get with a good
organization.

Jackson has been able to put his mouth where his money isn't,
talking his way into the televised public eye. Dukakis has kept
his eye on the meter, less a marathoner than a dogged racewalk-
er, with an eye on avoiding potholes.

Yet they both show the same thing: how a campaign can be
a mirror of the candidate. The two men are shining examples
of style as substance.

To those who live in Massachusetts, the advance of Mike
Dukakis from unknown to the head of the pack isn't surpris-
ing, although the ”liberal" label is. (It may say more about Mas-
sachusetts than Dukakis, but his is no lefty in Bay State eyes.)

Those who knew him as a candidate for state legislature
remember a guy who worked harder and smarter. He is not
without warmth, the man who married a young, divorced wom-
an with a baby long before the days of ”blended” families, the
governor who got home for dinner at night. But the Dukakis
who climbed the acropolis in his wingtips has always looked
akward without a jacket, and uncomnfortable rousing a crowd.

Asked by out-of-staters what makes Mike run, this Bostonian
has answered: He thinks he can do the job. The governor of
Massachusetts has the confidence — maybe irrational faith ——
that the country can be governed well. It's clear he wants to
DO it. It's a lot less clear what IT is he wants to do.

The national campaign reflects that part of the candidates
strengths and weaknesses: He's long on competence, short on
vision. The Dukakis campaign is not using money and organi-
zation to hide a lack of message. In a way, this is the message.
The message of management.

Those attracted to Dukakis are in large measure attracted to
the promise of competence in making the economy, and the
country, work. Massachusetts is one only mini-model for these
voters. The campaign is another.

Jesse Jackson, way on the other side of the style spectrum,
is the other surprisingly strong candidate. He is the one with
star quality, the man who speaks in a language that stirred even
the most taciturn of Maine voters into chants.

Those who've watched Jackson don't find his appeal surpris-
ing either. Continually behind schedule, he can make an au-
dience forget how long they've been waiting. Continually
underfunded, he can make up the deficit with his own energy.

Anyone who has, like this journalist, been singled out by Jack-
son at 6:30 a.m. on a pre-breakfast, pre-coffee ferry in New York
Harbor for a sermon on the drug threat, knows something about
hte power of the candidate. To the constituency of the left and
the left-out, Jackson's success is reassuring evidence of the
primacy of message over the paucity of a pocketbook.

But if Jackson knows what he wants to do, it's not all that
cle.ar he knows how to do it. In Boston, there is an old saying
abouit incompetent politicians. That guy couldn't run a two-
car funeral. Those who doubt Jackson's skills at managing any-
thing, let alone a country, find these doubts reinforced. His can-
didacy isn't a management team; it's a one-man band.

Among all the candidates, these two front-runners make the
oddest couple. The manager and the messenger. They're as
different in style as any on the campaign trail.

But they do illustrate one value of the endless endurance con-
test called the 1988 presidentilal campaign. Eventually, mys-
teriously, any campaign takes on the persona of the candidate.
If you look hard enough, you get a preview of what it would
look like if that man moved into the big headquarters, the White
House.

The total annual economic im-
pact of the University of Pitts-
burgh on the local economy is an
estimated $525.8 million.

These facts were presented in
the proposed budget to demon-

Pennsylvania students but also
works directly to enhance the
economy of western Penn-

sylvania.”

In addition to State appropria-

a $225 million private fund-

This effort will build upon State
funds by expanding endowments

Dr. James Billington, the Librarian of Congress, at yesterday's

at yesterday's lecture on the Library of Congress in the
Carnegie Library.

Congress

Continued from page 1

is through a national fellowship
program in which students could
be offered the opportunity to visit
the Library of Congress to use its
wide range of facilities.
Billington further explained
that a system could be set up in
which a student could insert a
laser disc containing 50 pieces of

’’visual information” which
could be printed out on paper.
Right now, the only way a Pitt
student can obtain information
from the Library of Congress is
through an interlibrary book loan.

Billington explained that this
national forum will be traveling
to other colleges and universities
throughout the country, but they

are not the primary targets. All
libraries may, in part, be in-
volved. Librarians from systems
throughout Allegheny and West-
moreland Counties plus scholars
from local universities participat-
ed in the forum yesterday and
proposed their suggestions for
making the Library of Congress
more effective.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, March I7, I988

By Patty Pisula

Staff Writer

Johnny Rhythm thinks that
American music in the 1980s has
just been too serious. His band,
The Dimestore 45s, takes a
healthy, irreverent look at popu-
lar culture in 1988.

His humor is blatantly apparent

‘in songs like ”If I Were Tiffany's

Boyfriend” and a little more sub-
tle in tunes such as ”| Don't
Remember Girls,” lamenting the
fact that although he can recall a
lot of stupid things from third
grade, the melody to a popular
Dwight Twilley song just escapes
him.

I must say that I have seen near-
ly every incarnation of Johnny
Rhythm and the Dimestore 45s,
so I feel qualified to say that there
is a definite constant: FUN! Take
a healthy dose of Gene Vincent,
add a pinch of Skid and Mojo, a
tiny hint of Nick Lowe and top it
off with Morey Amsterdam icing,
and you done got yourself a
crispy batch of Johnny Rhythm
and the Dimestore 455.

Q: Knowing your reputation
for, shall we say, short-term rela-
tionships with members of your
band, is it very safe to ask where
your bass player is this evening?

J.R.(guitar and vocals): We
have a bass player named Jerry,
but we lost his phone number.

Slim (guitar): He does send his
regards.

Q: Do you foresee a semi-
permanent lineup in the near
future?

J.R.: This is a permanent

,,Hangin’ out with JohnnyR

Hneup!

Slim: Absolutely!

Q: How did you find these
people?

J.R.: I guess it was that night
downtown ()n Liberty Avenue 

Slim: No sir! I just kept bother-
ing Johnny until he let me join.

Q: Originally, the 45s were
you, Mike /\/lichalski (Heretics)
on bass, Steve Heineman (ATS)
on drums and no lead guitar.
That lineup seemed pretty stable.
I mean, you recorded a single
and all that. Is it safe to assume
that the increasing Dimestore 45s
workload made it difficult for the
original members to make com-
mitments to more than one band,
to balance their priorities?

J.R.: Well, the biggest thing is
that we lost their phone numbers.

Slim: Yeah. We're really bad
with phone numbers.

J.R.: They just went on to differ-
ent pastures.

Q: Your current drummer, lim-
my, is what, your ninth, tenth
drummer?

J.R.: In the past week?

Q: In the past hour.

J.R.: Spiritually, Jimmy was al-
ways our drummer. We just phys-
ically stumbled on to him a few
days ago.

Jimmy: It was  destiny.

J.R.: We should really come up
with a better ”how we met”
story.

Slim: Well, just tell the truth.
You know, how we met on the
European tour. We were blowing
up our amps at that French club.
That's when it dawned on you
that we should change our image

Why, it's Johnny Rhythm.
and clean up the act.

J.R.: Oh. Oh, no.
remember.

(After a brief discussion about
how I often ask local bands their
impressions of other local bands
 )

J.R.: I have nothing against any
Pittsburgh band.

Jimmy: That's not what you say
at rehearsal.

Slim: We love everybody and
everything. I never met a band I
didn't like.

J.R.: There are a few Pittsburgh
bands whose records I wouldn't
rush out to buy.

Jimmy (while shuffling through
my records): Could we just drop
acid and listen to The Dark Side

Q: Speaking of records, you ’ve

fit into this picture?

J.R.: In the not-too-distant fu-
ture. Unfortunately, we lost the
record company’s phone num-
ber; We're waiting for them to
call us back. No, really, we have
a deal to do a record, but we
have five months to decide. In
that time, we're going to keep our
eyes open for any better deals. If
we don’t get any, we'll go with
this offer. The record, of course,
will include all of our smash hits.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, March l7, T988

It's Freaky Friday,

By William Young

There aren't any surprises in
Pictures latest film
release, Vice Versa. If you’ve
seen Freaky Friday or any other
of the ”personality change" mo-
vies, you’ve seen this one. This,
however, is not 11(‘( estsarily bad.

The plot is fairly simple. Mar-
shall Seymour (luilge Reinhold)
and his girlfriend/c‘oworker Sam
(Corrine Bohrer) travel to Taiwan
to purchase oriental parapherna-
lia for a sales promotion their
department store is going to start.
Coincidentally, a pair of art
thieves steal a mystical head from
a temple and need a way to get
into the United States without go-
ing through customs.

Needless to say, the skull
winds up in Seymour’s samples.
Strangely enough, while fighting
over the skull, Marshall and his
son Charlie (Fred Savage) argue
over how much easier it would
be to be the other person. Presto,
Marshall becomes Charlie, and
vice versa.

Although Brian Gilbert's direct-
ing doesn’t offer any new per-
spectives on the topic, he does,
at least, manage to use all of the

cliches of personality switching
without making the movie bor-
ing. it is mostly the lodge hein-
hold’s talent that offsets the
predictability and allows the film
to maintain some semblance of
reality.

Reinhold seems a little mis-
matched for the role of a
divorced, junior vice president of
a department store who must
babysit his 12-year-old son for a
week. l.)e.spite this impression,
l\’einhold takes the character of
Marshall Seymour a la son
Charlie and turns in a mostly be-
lievable performance.

Except for a few scenes, Rein-
hold manages to catch the es-
sence of a 12-year-old caught in
and adult’s body without over-
acting or looking totally stupid. In
fact, the possibilities ()f Rein-
hold’s ”changed” character are
not even touched on. Director
Gilbert seems satisfied to remain
within the safety of the bound-
aries laid down in previous films.

This is also true of Fred
Savage’s character, Charlie Sey-
mour turned father. Gilbert chose
to restrain the possibilities to the
usual scenarios: the father's intel-
ligence getting his ”son" good

0 I C ?
I s n t I t .
grades, trying to reason with
adults as an ”adult,” etc 

In neither case is the acting bad
(Reinhold and Savage), but both
instances abound with missed
opportunities to brealc new
ground with a scenario that has
been done the same way for a
long time.

it appears that Gilbert was so
interested in showcasing judge
l\’einhold in order to bring in big
bo>t-office returns, that he failed
to realize he was merely rehash-
ing old material --- and doing it
poorly in some cases. The film's
plot is executed just well enough
to carry the characters from scene
to scene without any incongrui-
ties to throw the viewer off track.
But it is precisely this that flaws
the movie.

Although the movie is perfect-
ly enjoyable in its present state,
a sense of deja vu pervades ev-
ery scene, while many scenes can
be predicted 10 or 20 minutes
before they show up on the
screen. In trying to make a cute
and enjoyable film, Gilbert
missed the boat on the number of
possible variations he could have
used to make the film an interest-
ing, as well as enjoyable, film.

including the hypnotic and eerie
atmospheric backdrop.

By far, the best track on this al—
bum is ”You and Me and Rain-
bows." The title nearly sounds
corny, but the song is a fabulous
compilation of six smaller ones,
each distinct and different. This
track is a long sucker; it con-
sumes most of side two. It's an
electronic feast of strange sounds.

There's‘ someone screaming like
the Sugar Cubes; some clanging
noises sound like a trip through
the kitchen; and there's even a
peaceful acoustic guitar thrown
in. Key is busy providing key-
boards, rhythym box, guitar, ra-
dio, tapes and voice on this
project. Finally, in some weird
way, this song sounds like

”Major Tom.”

”Deja Vu,” the first track on the
album, opens with a great refrain:
the same, the same/it's always
quite the same. This is certainly
not your typical memorize-the-
lyrics-since—they’re-included al-
bum. There's a lot of fine, but
really strange poetry in these

ABCNBCCBS: decoding the network jargon

By David Ballarotto
Staff Writer

See, you can trust me. I said I'd
be back in two weeks. It's been
two weeks, and I'm back. And
they say you just can't depend on
our generation.

One thing you can depend on
these days is terrible television
programming. CBS and ABC
seem to be specializing in this
with their midseason replace-
ments on Tuesday nights.

Let's start with ABC. After my
last column, a friend of mine told
me I hardly ever review ABC pro-
grams. The Wonder Years is a
good reason why.

This program is about Kevin Ar-
nold, a man of this decade
remembering his youth and
growing up in the suburbs of the
19605. ‘

Now, if you're into programs
about the 19605, growing up or
the suburbs, then this program is
for you. I'm into none of the
above and hated this show.

First of all, young Kevin is over-
played by Fred Savage._lt seems
either the producers or the net-
work wanted a cutesy-type, intel-
ligent kid. This kid's neither.

Instead, he overacts. You know
the type of kid you always see
when game shows have ”Kids'
Week"? The kind who thinks he's
a star? Watching annoying brats
is not my idea of an evening of
television.

And |'ll tell you what else I
hate, too. TV shows such as Trial
and Error and Coming of Age.

Both of these programs exem-
plify what's wrong with most CBS

sitcoms. They have funny situa-
tions and unlikeable characters.

Take Coming of Age and Paul
Dooley’s portrayal of the main
character, Dick Hale. He's an ir-
ritating, exasperating, unlikeable
character to whom we, the au-
dience, are supposed to devote a
half hour of our precious time.

First, this guy is rude and
comes off as rude. He insults his
neighbor Ed Pepper (Alan
Young), and we're supposed to
think the joke is funny. Dick Hale
complains about everything and
anything.

True, you can say Archie
Bunker did this, but the differ-
ence is this: when Norman Lear
was transferring Till Death to Us
Part to American TV, he knew
enough to portray Archie in a
way that no matter how ignorant,
prejudiced, opinionated or stupid
he was, the audience would still
like him.

This is far from the case with
Dick Hale. Hopefully, this unin-
teresting, unlikeable character
will, along with Coming of Age,
be canceled.

And while we're at it, Trial and
Error stinks, too.

Here we have Eddie Velez and
Paul Rodriguez playing two Los
Angeles roommates. Velez plays
a lawyer and Rodriguez plays an
entrepreneur.

In the first episode, Velez got
a job at a prestigious law firm,
complete with a sassy secretary.
Velez got into some funny situa-
tions, but -there was never any
reason at all to like his or
Rodriguez’ character.

For instance, Velez breaks the

boat on his boss’ desk. Embar-
rassing in real life, but ifwe don't
like the character, who cares
what he does?

So listen and listen good, all
you TV producers and network
programmers: If you're going to
give us more of this garbage, ex-
pect your ratings to go down.

The secret (and it should be ob-
vious) is to have likeable charac-
ters. Ricky isn't the only one who
loves Lucy. If the audience cares
about the character, then we can
care about his situations.

Why should we waste our time
watching these boring characters?

Mini Reviews

There are two good shows now
on the air. CBS’s Eisenhower and
Lutz and NBC’s Aaron's Way
make you like the characters,
even if they're creeps or extreme-
ly wholesome.

On Eisenhower and Lutz, we
have one of the biggest creeps to
hit the airwaves ever. Scott Bak-
ula plays Bud Lutz Jr., a struggling
young lawyer with the morals of
a tomato.

But here's the key. Although
he's rude to the next—door sushi
deliveryman, hasn't paid his
secretary in months and has his
calling cards complete with a
hole for your Rolodex, he's
funny.

Although he's similar to the
Richard Rodgers-Lorenz Hart-
John O'Hara Pal loey protagonist,
Bud Lutz is actually a creep.
However, he is presented with
some sort of redeeming value.
I'm not exactly sure what it is, but

it's there.

If you're not doing anything
Monday nights, catch this pro-
gram. It's pretty good.

Grade: B

Merlin Olsen's Aaron's Way
is surprisingly good. The premise
sounds boring: an Amish family
goes to California to help their
dead son's pregnant girlfriend.

But here's why this show
works. The Amish characters are
fairly Amish, and the Californians
are fairly Californian, yet the two

families like one another.

I think this is an important area
of TV writing. If the characters are
likeable and like one another,

"then you're going to care about
them and their predicaments.

This series doesn't play up the
extremes of either the Amish or
Californian way of life. It's not, af-
ter all, a sitcom. But rather, both

families represent something in

each of us; the struggles between

the two ways of life are similar to

internal struggles of conscience.

They were to be at CMU on March 23.
However, the Pixies will be here that
night at The Decade. Opening for them
will be the latest local big thing, The

grow on you until they become
quite appealing. This song is very
much along the lines of Skinny

The recent promulgation of lo-
cal music on Pittsburgh radio sta-
tions has perked a few ears, but
as any businessman kn()ws,
quantity does not necessarily
mean quality.

Clubgoers could stare up and
down the streets of Oakland at
the endless succession of bland
synthpopsters pawning their
souls for a record, the thrash
metalheads strutting behind span-
(lex facades or the rock ‘n’ roll
denim dinosuars still professing
that imaginary working class
ethic, and never hear a single
note of interest.

The situation _is different at the
American Legion in Squirrel Hill.
For over a year, free-thinking au-
diences have been able to fork
over minimum bucksfor maxi-
mum original shows featuring the
likes of Special Ed, Crow Flies,
Cynics, Heretics, Banner Day,
and ATS, while shirking the club
owners and designer poseurs.

The flagship band of this decla-
ration of independence is Car-
sickness. Yes, that's right, these
are the guys whose independent
natures never tolerated commer-

cial exploitation and whose ener-

getic style has lasted through over
eight years of lineup changes to
become a Pittsburgh legend.

Carsickness is now so integral
to the scene that their failure to

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, March 17, 1988

Tired of the cure? Get Carsickness!
Expect no disappointments in 1988

produce new recorded material
in 1986 was noted by In Pitts-
burgh to be the ”biggest disap-
pointment of the year.”
Previously, they had satisfied
their fans with several singles,
two albums and a compilation.
Their 1985 cassette, Re/ease,
naturally garnered enough votes
to capture the best local release
award in In Pittsburgh's poll that

year.

llungry lrequenters of the
legion need fret no longer as Car-
sickness has released a new bom-
bast called Tattoo the Wic/(ed in
/\(/vance of the (frinie. The title
refers to their concern for the hys-
teria over AIDS in this country
and the secret plans, revealed as
part of the Iran-Contra scandal,
that contained the intent to
quarantine high-risk groups such
as homosexuals in "treatment
centers” (read concentration
camps). Included with the cas-
sette is a lyric sheet, a condom,
a stone and a booklet detailing
AIDS prevention methods. All the
goodies come in a spiffy hand-
decorated bag.

Obviously, elaborate packag-
ing means nothing without good
music, and Carsickness has never
failed to please. The tape leads off
with the whirling funk of ”Scis-
sor Man” and abruptly plunges
into their well-known tune, “I
Don’t Think So.” The recording
of a televangelist confessing his
sins begins a set of three newer
songs — ”Fundamentalist.”

"Hypnotic Narcotic” and
”Mother of Pearl” —— always re-
maining intricate while
danceable.

Two more new songs are fol-
lowed on side two by their most
famous work of late, "Fallen An-
gel,” which was originally
planned for release on a single.
Carsickness has always per-
formed “Fallen Angel" with a
long improvisational break in the
middle, showcasing in ttirn the
considerable talents of guitarist
Joe Soap, drummer Dennis
Childers, the horn section and
new bassist Scott Martin. The
unique improvisation on the cas-
sette spirals into rather spacey
hallucinations before returing to
the backbeat of solid ground.

The amalgam of jazz-punk-
funk—rock that is Carsickness
keeps their music head and
shoulders above all the makeup-
ridden pretenders of Pittsburgh,
and people are recognizing their
creativity. Tattoo the Wicked
placed at No. 13 on CMU radio
station WRCT one week after its
release, and it should shortly soar
to No. 1. The original 50 copies
were all sold at the tape release
party on March 5, so 50 more
cassettes have been produced for
their next show with the Crow
Flies on March 25 at the Legion.

There's no better way to dis-
cover what all this Carsickness is
about than to see them live. Feel
the bomp; it is happening.

Panthers take NCAA Tournament in stride

By Matt Martin

Assistant Sports Editor

”We’re Final Four bound,"
6-foot-10 senior center Charles
Smith boldly proclaimed at Pitt
basketball practice Wednesday
morning. ”There’s no doubt
about it.”

While Smith may have staked
his claim a little early, most of his
teammates share at least some of

his sentiments.

’’I think if we play, we can beat
them with our personnel,” fresh-
man point guard Sean Miller said,
referring to the Panthers’ opening
round opponent, Eastern
Michigan.

This holds true for the entire
tournament, though. If Pitt plays
up to its potential, the Final Four
and the championship game are
not out of the question.

Lady Panthers’ strong
finish may be sign of
better times to come

By Matt Martin

Assistant Sports Editor

The Pitt Lady Panthers basket-
ball team has just wrapped up its
most successful season since
1984-85, finishing 14-15 and ad-
vancing to the semifinal round of
the Big East Tournament.

Pitt made a late season run,
defeating Seton Hall 83-67 and
Villanova 75-73, to move into
seventh place in the conference,
the first time Pitt has not been
eighth or ninth since the '84-85
season.

‘ 

We finished real
strong, with two upsets
in our league. We did
what we had to do 
You definitely don't
want to finish weak.

— Kirk Bruce

This was also the first time Pitt
had won back-to-back league
games in three years.

But the Lady Panthers did the
statistics one better: they defeat-
ed Villanova 54-51 for the sec-
ond time inside a week in the
quarterfinals of the league cham-
pionships.

”We finished real strong, with
two major upsets in our league,”
Pitt coach Kirk Bruce said. ”We
did what we had to do.”

For some truly scrambled-eggs
reason, the NFL has set out to
prove the following illogic: East
is not always east but is some-
times a lot farther west than you'd
think, and west is not always west
but is sometimes considered to
be located in areas that mapmak-
ers describe as eastern sectors of
thecountry.

And as for pinpointing what is
described as the mid-section of
these United States, well, the
league would probably have an
easier time winning a race for
folks with no sense of direction.

Confused? Give me a few more
paragraphs.

son on the same high note that
they finished on, winning six of
their first eight games. Pitt last
only to the University of Nevada-
Las-Vegas and Penn State, both
nationally ranked teams at the
time.

But somehow the Lady Pan-
thers lost all momentum after
that, losing a team-record seven
consecutive games, including a
70-44 pasting by Boston College.

Pitt got back on track with an
85-79 conference victory over Se
ton Hall on Jan. 23 and went 8-6
from then on, including the tour-
nament victory.

Third-seeded St. John's
knocked the Panthers out of the
championships with a 93-73 vic-
tory March 5 at Fitzgerald Field
House.

”We had three different types
of seasons,” Bruce said. ”We
played pretty good until early De-
cember.

”But after Christmas, we start-
ed with the West Virginia loss
[63-62 at Altoona High School] 
and we stumbled,” he said.

”But we finished strong. You
definitely don't want to finish
weak," Bruce concluded.

The Big East finished strong as
well, sending three teams (St.
John's, regular season champion
Syracuse and runner-up Villano-
va) to the 40-team NCAA Nation-
al Women's Championship
Tournament.

Bruce is optimistic about next
season. ”We’ve got virtually the

owners, meeting this week in —
coincidentally enough —- Phoe-
nix, AZ., have unanimously ap-
proved the St. Louis Cardinals’
move to that fine desert city. So
now the team will be appropri-
ately called the Phoenix Cardi-
nals, and St. Louie pennants
hanging in the bedrooms of fans
both young and old will have to
be de-”Fun-Tac”-ed and stashed
protectively away in crammed
cubbyholes alongside pennants
bearing the names Oakland Raid-
ers and Baltimore Colts.

Maybe one day those pennants
will bring in a couple of dollars
at some old-timer's sports
memorabilia auction, but for

Smith put it all in perspective:
”We cannot think ahead; we
have to take them one at a time.”

Pitt, 23-6 and ranked eighth in
the final Associated Press poll, is
the second seed in the Midwest
regional. Only Purdue, the
favorite to win the tournament at
4:1 odds, is ranked ahead of them
in their section.

The Panthers are optimistic
about their chances in this year’s

now, they basically ain't no good.

The problem at hand is not the
Cardinals’ move to Phoenix. That
franchise could peacefully flutter
anywhere it wants,-and it would
still, to be blunt, stink worse than
the bottom of Andre the Giant's
-laundry hamper.

The Cards are not a good
squad, never really have been.
They flirted with the playoffs this
past season, but only because the
rest of the league's play was any-
thing but inspired. The team's

tourney, particularly since there
are no other Big East teams seed-
ed in their regional.

’’I’m glad to get out of the Big
East,” Miller said. ”We’re like
starting over again. No matter
how well they [Eastern Michigan]
scout us, they don't know
everything.”

”Seton Hall had our plays like
the back of their hand,” Smith
added.

owner, Bill Bidwell, claims he'll
make a lot more moolah in pro
football-starved Phoenix than in
baseball-crazed St. Louis. And in
the short run, he will.

The new stadium, Sun Devil,
it's called, has a much heftier
seating capacity than Busch
Memorial, the team's old home.
If the Cardinals are even semi-
competitive, Sun Devil Stadium
should have its share of weekly
sell-outs. _

What is so ridiculous about this
move is that the league plans to
keep the Cards in the Eastern di-
vision of the NFC.

Tell me, what is eastern about
Phoenix?

But it's not an impossibility that
the Panthers could once again
match up against a league rival —-
Georgetown and Syracuse are
both seeded in the East Regional.

The East and Midwest semi-
final winners meet in the Final
Four on April 2.

But for the time being, Pitt

For that matter, what is western

The divisional lineups in the
NFL are in dire need of a good,

"They play hard," Gore said.
”They like to run.”

Eastern Michigan is led by 6-8

MAC Player of the Year. Long
averages 23.2 points and 10.6 re-

Freshman off—guard Lorenzo
Neely also keys the Huron
offense. Averaging 1 1 points and
2.7 rebounds per game, Neely
was voted Freshman of the Year
in the MAC.

Coach Ben Braun was also vot-
ed Coach of the Year.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, March l7, l988

Other than in terms of height
(E. Michigan has no starter above
6-8), the Hurons and Panthers
seem to match up on paper.
Smith finished the season averag-
ing 18.4 points and 7.5 rebounds
a game, garnering All-American
and -Big East Player of the Year
honors in the process.

Miller was voted Big East Fresh-
man of the Year after averaging
9.6 points and 5.6 assists per
game for the Panthers, who won
the regular season league title
with a 12-4 record.

Also, of course, there’s Jerome
Lane, the ever—present rebound-

ing force.

Miller is not bothered by the
credentials of his foes, particular-
ly Neely. ’’I’m just going to play
like I usually do.”

But for Smith and Gore, this is
the final hurrah in their Pitt
careers before the NBA draft.

’’If both have great NCAA
Tournaments, their stock [in the
draft] will go up,” Miller sai<t'°>.
”|t’s their last go-around.”

Core seems to be more con-
cerned with the present situation
than the June draft, however.
”We know if we come out over-
confident, we lose. That's it. It's
over,” he said.

Women ’s track team

places 7th

By Don Boyd
Staff Writer

l_ed by a first-place finish in the
mile relay, the Lady Panthers
finished seventh out of the 126
teams which participated in the
Eastern Track Championships.
The championships were held at
Yale University on March 5.

Cyndi Randolph, Gloria Azeke,
Ardythe Hope and Keisha Demas
recorded a time of 3:45.35, set-
ting a new school record in the
process of winning the mile relay.

Pitt's distance medley relay
team of Hope, Pat Cupid, Cathy
Chrissos and Azeke finished third
in their event as another Lady
Panther record was set
(1 1:46.01).

As far as individual perfor-
mances, two Pitt pentathletes dis-
tinguished themselves. Freshman
Clarissa Dudley finished a strong
fourth with 3,530 points while
teammate Hannah Russell took
sixth (3,482).

Misfortune dogged the Lady
Panthers’ Demas. The freshman
sensation from Brooklyn was dis-

in N CAAS

qualified after finishing fourth in
the quarter-mile race (54.54).

Pitt coach Steve Lewis ex-
plained the controversial deci-
sion to disqualify Demas: ”Keisha
was leading the race when the
girl running behind her threw up
her arms as though she did not
have enough room to run.

”There was no contact, and
there was no lane violation by
Keisha. Unfortunately, Keisha is
a freshman and not an estab-
lished name in track circles. The
other girl's protest was upheld,
and Keisha was disqualified,”
said a disappointed Lewis.

Not only did a fine race by De-
mas go for naught, but her time
would have enabled her to be-
come the first Lady Panther to
participate in the NCAA champi-
onships.

Despite the Demas disquali-
fication, it is important for the
Lady Panthers to keep things in
perspective. They are a young
team that is going to get better
and better.

Finishing seventh in the Eastern
Championships has earmarked
Pitt as an ut}and—coming team.

It's time for a bit of divisional

Ney diving into NCAA Tourney,
hopes for All-American status

By Debbi Edwards

For the Pitt News

Reflecting on our past is often
sobering. It has forced most to ad-
mit personal disappointment and
weaken to an ’’If I'd only known”
position.

It touches defeated athletes,
who often feel they could have
worked a little harder at practice
or better followed the advice of
a coach.

It is the atypical person who
understands this attitude. It's the
determined and c()urageous who
can over(:ome obstacles on the
way to what they really want.

Tricia Ney, a senior (liver at the
University of Pittsburgh, has be-
come that type of athlete.

”When Tricia is down, she
doesn't give up,” explained
Julian Krug, Ney’s (living coach
at Pitt for the past five years. ”She
just works that much harder.

”l’ve always tried to teach that
once you learn something, you
can never forget; things you've
worked hard for can never leave
you.”

Ney applied those words to her
own fight to return to competitive
diving.

What she had to overcome was
a completely separated, anterior
cruciate ligament. It forced her to
have total reconstructive knee
surgery.

That injury was seemingly go-
ing to rob Ney of years of work

l

that would have paid off later.

Krug and Ney decided that a
medical redshirt would be best.
She accepted the decision as only
a delay in her plans.

’’I knew I'd be back after sur-
gery,” Ney said. ’’I knew inside
that I could return stronger than
ever.”

6 

After all the hard
work, All-American
would be a dream, but
I'd be happy with
honorable mention.

— Tricia Ney

Ney not only returned to the
boards within one year, l)ut she
proved herself the very best in the
Big East. At the recent champion-
ships at Pitt's Trees Pool, she cap-
tured both the 1- and 3—meter
(living titles, breaking conference
records and maintaining her hold
on Pitt and Trees Pool records.
She was distinguished with the
Most Outstanding Female Diver
Award.

She has proven her abilities
again at the prequalifiers for the
NCAA championships, winning
first place on the 3—meter board
and third on the l—meter. Ney
qualified on the 3—meter two
years ago and finished at 22. It

was enough to fuel her desire to
return and focus on becoming
All-American.

All-America honors belong to
the top eight in each competition;
honorable mention All-America
goes to the ninth- through 16th-
place finishers.

”After all the hard work, All-
American would be a dream, but
making honorable mention
would make me very happy,”
Ney explained.

Just a week before the pre-
qualifiers, Ney had placed sixth
on the l—meter and second on the
3-meter at Easterns held at
H a rva rd.

”Tricia faced a lot of pressure
coming into the prequalifiers,”
Krug said. ”The competition is
much tougher. She is a high-
(‘aliber athlete who has ma(le a
remarkable comeba(‘k. Tricia is
(living stronger than ever.”

Ney maintains that dedicated
effort in all her endeavors. She is
an above-average student in her
education major, maintaining a
3.0 QPA.

It's not simple to balance a
practice schedule and classwork,
especially considering that Ney is
(leaf. She is forced to understand
classes and lectures by reading
lips.

Ney is indeed a special student-
athlete. She has managed to han-
dle all of life's obstacles in the
same manner she dives into the
pool — effectively and with style.

I said, minus senior forward Sally
Sheerer, Pitt’s leading scorer in
1986-87 and second this year
with 13 points per game.

But the rest of the league teams
also lose valuable seniors to
graduation. ”lt’|l be wide open
next year,” Bruce said. ”We’re a
team not hurt by graduation.”

’’If it only takes 20 wins to get
into the NCAAs, we can do it,”

‘re added.

With his returning players,
Bruce definitely has a shot at the
tournament.

Returning are four starters, in-
cluding leading scorer freshman
Lorri Johnson, who averaged 16

points per Big East contest.

Also returning are point guard
Denise Becher, forward Deidra
Baker and two—guard Jennifer
Shingler.

The Lady Panther starters are
also complemented by a deep
bench that includes former start-
ing center Tabatha Long, 6—foot-4
reserve center Connie Hurt,
guards Jill Sitlinger and Shaunda
Byrd and center/forward Amy
Holman.

Bruce has also recruited Sandy
Baker, a forward from nationally
ranked Altoona High School, for
next season.

”We’ve got a good team to
build from,” Bruce said.
