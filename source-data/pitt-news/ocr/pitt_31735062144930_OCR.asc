4 A "_Ai_d In Distinguishing Guﬁy Triplets

’l‘Jim iand‘Bi/ll are the twins, and
rm the triplet,” "0 says Lowery
Giiifey gin relating the experiences

' “But we think it’s not so different
being one?'of three as it is to be only
one,’ ‘he continues with a smile.
When the three boys are together,
people naturally stare; but the Gut’-
feya-have grown accustomed to this.
The fact that Lowery has brown

and ‘.,that the resemblance to each
other is becoming less marked as the
menﬂgrow older, has helped people
identify -the triplets.

';However, much trouble still
arises indistinguishing Jones and
Williams. From the back, they show
no difference in appearance, for they
even walk alike. Mrs. Lindsay, regis-
trar at the Law School, has learned
to tell the boys’ apart because Bill
has'a‘ broken tooth and_James has
a larger head. In addition he combs
his hair straight back from his'fore-
head,“ while William wears his
pagrted. T V

of the Lowerys. ‘A country girl.
who had written to William, told
him among-other things how many
cows and pigs were on the farm;
what her chores were, etc. , V

But a triplet does have an advan-
tage in the class room. Since uni-
versity instructors address students
merely by letters. The. Guffeys
made an agreement somewhat to the
disadvantage of their profs among
themselves that only the one -who
best knew the answer should recite.
While the boys were in high school,
the teachers .commonl—y complained
that “the two are all ‘right, but the
third is a rascal.”

The Guffey triplets, James, Wil-
liam and Lowery, registered at Pitt
this fallffor the second time in th.Vei_r
college careers. They are the only
triplets ever to have enrolled at
Pitt. Four years ago, they registered
as, freshmen, and this year, after
c‘ o m p lVe ting their undergraduate
work at the University of Michigan.
they are back at Pitt in the graduate

Speaking as an ex-editor in good
amateur standing, I’d say that this
football number is a good Panther.
Of course, I’ve‘seen better ones. And
then, "there have been worse. Not
for a long time, it’s true, but much
worse. . V

I‘ especially - liked the cover, al-
though theidea of posing without_ a
collar seems, tome, rather naive.
Perhaps it is intended to create an
informal effect. Or, maybe it was
posed in the bathtub? At any rate
it was a good idea, although I must
confess that I was somewhat startled,
to see a p,orti'ait of the editor on
the very front cover. Back in my
day it. would have been considered
rather daring; but, then, this boy
V: Savage has already achieved a repu-
gtation for being willing to go to any
llengths to give his readers a laugh!

about 15 miles from the Vheart of

there. A number. of the Pitt grads

basketball at both institutions. Both
schools have big gymnasiums which

   NVELCH owes TALK»

; .'I'O Y. M. c. A. mos

Gilbert L. Welch, better known as
_Captain Gibby of Pitt’s undefeated
1927 football team, is a success in

» other lines than dodging opposing

tacklers. Standing bravely on a
platform before six hundred boys in

 I . the Henry Clay Frick School audi-

torium last Friday evening, he de-
livered the most inspiring speech
that youthful football fans have
heard in many years. An idol in
the heart of every boy that sat be-
fore him, Gibby held his worshipful
audience spell-bound while he told
them about his early life and mem-
bership in the Y. M. .C. A.

The meeting was held by the
Oakland branch of the Y. M. C. A.
and was for the purpose of arous-
ing interest in Y work. No better
speaker could have been selected
than Captain Welch, for the enthusi-
astic crowd of boys between the
ages of eight and ﬁfteen devoured
every word and every move of their
hero. Gibby stated that he joined
the Y when he was eight years of
age and has been a member ever
since. He attributes much of his
success on the ﬁeld to ‘the encour-
agement for clean living -that he re-
ceived during his Y afﬁliation.

R. W. Kost, boys’ work secre-tar
of the Oakland Y; and who was in

, charge -of the meet, has many words

of praise for Welch. He states:

“Gibby was at his best last Friday

evening and gave a wonderful talk
to my boys. He has an enviable
way of putting pep into his talk and
makes a decided hit with -every one
that hears, him.”

Pitt has always considered -the
carrying of excess credits 3.. sort of
scholarship by which a student is
granted more than the ordinary‘
number of credits‘ for the same
($300) tuition. If a student carries
excesszcredits during his first years
at Pitt, he may shorten his‘ course

and save both time and money.

Often, in deciding irregular cases,
the chairman must laugh silently
whenthe door closes behind some
poor student who -begs‘ for excess
credits, for no one ever heard such
naive explanations. for scholastic
records. Everything from a half
credit in geology to a four credit lab
course are requested and the stu-
dents invent the most , ingenious
reasons» for wanting these courses.

And the chairman must ever re-

that he may help the earnest student
