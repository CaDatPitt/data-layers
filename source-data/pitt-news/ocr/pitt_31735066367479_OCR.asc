(Editor’s Note: The following ’
distinguished members of the

to the Pitt News concerning the
charges against Dr. Robert G.
Colodny and the position taken
by the University in this m.at-
tcr.)

Dr. Albert B. Martin, dean
of the School of Liberal Arts:
“It is worse than unfortunate
that those persons responsi-
ble for the charges made
against Professor Colodny
chose to sit as judges on ,a man’s
good name without the beneﬁt of
an investigation. Irresponsible
charges growing out of guilt by
association are a serious threat to
the integrity of the academic
community and to the essential
vitality of democratic society.
They are particularly unfortunate
when directed against a man such
as Professor Colodny '.'ho has the
reputation of being a stimulating
and effective teacher.

“I am in complete agreement
with the position taken by Chan-
cellor Litchﬁeld.”

Dr. Max A. Lauifer, dean of the
Division of Natural Sciences: “The
Chancellor's statement was mag-
niﬁcent!”

Dr. E. R. McCluskey, vice chan-

cellor for the Schools of the
Health Professions: “I do not
know Dr. Colodny personally.

observations to make, having

Students Give Vent to Feelings
On Academic Policies, Politics

(Editor’s Note: Universities include members of the administra-
tion, faculty and students. At the University of Pittsburgh the
former two have already taken their stand on the “Colodny Case.”
We feel that students also should be given an opportunity to ex-
press themselves’ on this issue so pertinent to their academic life.)

Ralph Hallow, graduate student in History: “Student
opinion seems to be that Dr. Colodny is one of the ﬁnest
teachers here. Whatever his poli-O

tical convictions are, it’s nobody’s
business but his own. Academic
freedom means the right to have
beliefs contrary to those of the
majority. Should this freedom be

abrogated in any way, the Univer-
sity as a center for inquiry into
truth would dry up and wither
away. All students who believe in
freedom of speech hope that the
administration, and everyone con-
cerned with teaching will stand
unequivocally for the principles
of free inquiry.”

’ Pat» Piccola, Arts six: “The
chancellor is to be commended
for his statement supporting
academic freedom in general as
well as defending a professor
whose scholarship and dedica-
tion is, in my opinion, unques-
tionable. Having studied under
Dr. Colodny, I feel a great debt
to this man whose search for
truth has been inspiring and
challenging.” 1

Investigating Group

By HARRIET A. VVEHNER

PA three—man

committee is now investigating Dr. Rob-

ert G. Colodny, associate professor of history, who was
recently charged by Rep. John T. Walsh of McKeesport as

being pro-Communist.

The members of the committee appointed last week by
Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld are Philip Powers, assist-
ant chancellor for development, Dr. Robert E. Olson, pro-
fessor of Biochemistry, and George D. Lockhart, member
of the board of trustees. Mr. Powers is chairman of the group.

The law firm of Eckert, Seamans and Cherin, an inde-

SCRO Plans
For Religious

EInphasisWeel<

‘ by TOM MGGOVERN

Why should religious organiza-
tions exist on the campus of a
modern university? What part, if
any, can a belief in God play in
the life of intelligent and educat-
ed people? V

It is to call attention to these
and other questions that the Stu-
dent Council of Religious Organi-
zations has scheduled next week
as “Religious Emphasis Week.”

The purpose of Religious Em-
phasis Week is to increase student
interest in religion and to encour-
age thoughtgon the subject. As
James Diggs, publicity editor of
SCRO, expressed, “We want to
provide students with information
on different religions and what
they stand for.”

This will be the first such pro-
gram scheduled at the University
in several years.

The general plan of the week's
events calls for a series of ad-
dresses by speakers of various

(Continued on Page 2)

‘all concerned.

. ‘ Study Charged

‘Dr. Litchﬁeld stated that the
purpose of the committee is “nei-
ther to blackmail nor to white-
wash” but to make a “complete
study of the charges” against Dr.
Colodny.

Rep. Walsh's resolution to the
state assembly requested that a.
joint House-Senate investigation
be made in all state institutions
-—with emphasis on pro-com-
munist philosophy being taught
in classrooms.

In an interview with Herbert G.
Stein, Post-Gazette reporter, last
week, Colodny said that he was
conﬁdent that the three—man com-
mittee’s investigation will reveal
nothing detrimental to the secur-
ity or welfare of the United States.

The impetus for the many at-
tacks against Dr. Colodny was the
news story appearing on the front
page of the Jan. 15 issue of the
Pittsburgh Press. The news story,
an interview with Dr. Colodny,
concerned the present Cuban con-
ﬂict.

Investigation Demanded

The immediate result of this ar-
ticle was a stir in the state con-
gress. Dep. Walsh, who will run
against Mayor Andrew Jackomas
in the May 16 Democratic mayor-
alty primary, brought the subject

Interpreter of Pantomime Set W/ednesday

Franz Reynders to Appear at Midday  

Franz Reynders, considered by
many critics to be the most talent-
ed interpreter of pantomime on
the American scene, will appear
before the Midday Series on Wed-
nesday in The Stephen Foster
Memorial.

Born in Holland, Reynders was

‘a member of the Dutch under-

ground during World War II.
After the war he studied at the
Amsterdam Academy of Art and
later under the leadership of Eti-
enne Decroux, foremost master of
the modern pantomime, in Paris.

Reynders toured Europe and
Great Britain with Decroux for
two y e a rs‘ before returning to
Holland, where he starred in two
musical comedies. He came to the
United States after his marriage
in 1955.

“Children and deaf people are
among my most responsive audi-

. ences,” says the tall Hollander

.~.,...,

who has performed before many

elementary school children and

the Students of Gallaudet Col-
lege for the Deaf in Washington,

D.C.

’Early in 1960 he joined with
lthe Springﬁeld, Massachusetts,
[Symphony Orchestra in present-
ing a world premiere performance
of mime and orchestra. Reynders
pantomimed the part of Till in
“The Merry Pranks of Till Eulen-
spiegel,” by Richard Strauss.

Commenting on this production,
critics acknowledged that Reyn-
ders “rose nobly to the world
premiere challenge with a per-
formance marked by agility, flex-
»ibility and wit.

“Poignant illusion, delicate hu-
mor. wit and beauty are inherent
in pantomime. But these qualities
cannot be interpreted and con-
veyed to an audience without con-

(Co’n.ti‘nued from Page 1)
to the ﬂoor, re—emphasi2ing parts
of the article concerned with C01-

‘ odny’s past. He then demanded

an appropriate investigation.
The next day Dr. Litchﬁeld
issued a statement to the press
regarding the University posi-
tion in the matter. He said, “By
law, by charter, and by convic-
tion, the University of Pitts-
burgh is committed to resist
Communism in every possible
way.

“If anyone ever has concrete
evidence that any one of our fac-
ulty members is engaged in activi-
ties subvcrsive to the Constitution
of our nation or our common-
wealth, is is his responsibility to
come forward with that evidence.

2 At the same time, we deplore all

forms of’ unfair and defamatory
accusations leveled against any
man. Such attacks are in reality
attacks on our democratic proc-
esses and freedoms, and have no
place in in society such as ours.”
In regard to Colodny’s past,
Litchfleld said, "We were aware
that Dr. Colodny was among the
non-communist Americans who
actively resisted the Axis Powers
in Spain in 1938. We also know

3 that heiserved in a British infor-

mation service in Mexico, when
the Allies were fighting fascism’s
entry into Latin America. Dr.
Colodny volunteered in the U. S.
Army during World War II, re-
ceived secret security clearance to
serve in a unit controlled by Army
intelligence, and later was deco-
rated and received a commenda-
tion.”
Attests to Loyalty

In conclusion, Dr. Litchlield
said, “We have attested to Dr. Col-
odny’s loyalty to democracy, and
we have found nothing substan-
tive to date which would cause us
to doubt his loyalty now.”

Another statement issued to
the press last Tuesday was that
of the University’s chapter of
American Association of Uni-
versity Professors. In this, they
protested the personal attack on
their colleague, Dr. Colodny.

In relationship to the Pittsburgh
Press’s news story, they said, “The
article in question, though in the
guise of a news story, was inter-
spersed with editorial comment,
and employed the techniques of
innuendo and guilt by association,
and could serve no purpose other
than to injure the reputation 01.‘
Professor Colodny. The style and
tenor of this article constitute a
threat to academic freedom in this
community.”

Two days later, after Walsh’s
resolution had been presented to
the General Assembly in Harris-
burg, this group issued another
statement.

Eisenhower Quoted

In it they quoted President
Eisenhower’s warning to the na-
tion concerning the domination of
the nation’s scholars by govern-
ment. Pres. Eisenhower felt that
this was something which “is
gravely to be regarded.”

The statement to the press
then read: “His warning came
none too soon. On the same day,
day, a resolution was introduced _
in the Legislature of our Com-
monwealth calling for an inves-
tigation of opinions held by fac-
ulty members at state-aided col-
leges and universities-—a resolu-
tion prompted by one newspa-
perman’s personal attack upon
the reputation of one of our col-
leagues, Professor Robert Col-
odny.”

They stated that such an inquiry
into opinions undermines those

Kaufmann Sets Four Point Plan

Midday Speaker
Offers Ideas On.

O—wn. Principles

By JULES ZACHER
Humbition, tempered , with
love, courage and honesty,
are the cardinal virtues of the
ethic of Dr. Walter Kauf-
mann, Princeton philosopher.

Dr. Kaufmann delivered his

lecture “Ethic of a Heretic” be-
fore a large audience at the Mid-
day Series last Wednesday.

“Humbition, the philosopher
said, is a word fused from humil-
ity and ambition, a virtue that
makes a person humble but not
meek, ambitious but not over-
bearing . . . One without the other
is ineffective.” \ A

“Judge yourself as you judge
your neighbor,” is the true mean-
ing of humbition. The faults that
one notices in others should more
clearly bring out the faults of the
viewer, he explained.

Offers New Idea

A second part of his ethic was
love. A different interpretation
was offered by Dr. Kaufmann than
that which is commonly thovr*ht.

This love is not physical, but a
deep emotional feeling which can
bring on despair and misery. These
feelings arise when a person loves,
yet at the same time can see, and
sympathizes with, the suffering
and misery of the person loved.

Courage, another of Dr. Kauf-
inann’s virtues, will not permit
stagnation which might result
from ‘the misery one has after
accepting the responsibilities of
love. n

“Hamlet, Caesar and Othello all
demand sympathy and admiration”
because they had the courage to
lead full lives after they realized
the tragic position that they were
in.

Dr. Kaufmann also pointed out
that if these heroes had withdrawn
into ‘themselves, then these famojus
classics would be just ordinary
plays.

Honesty Necessary

“Without thorough honesty, my
final virtue, the other three fail,”
the eminent philosopher continued.
Ilonesty is the basis for the other
morals because humbition is the
honesty to face one’s imperfec-
tions, love is honestly facing the
hurts of others, and courage is
honestly confronting risk. .

Dr. Kaufmann’s honesty should
not be confused with sincerity.

This point was vividly brought
to mind when he referred to the
speeches of prominent politi-
cians. Often, these speeches re
presented with all the sincere
effort that the politician pos-
sesses, though he knows that the
speech is not entirely true.

Dr. Kaufmann brought his four
virtues to bear on a current Amer-
ican problem, segregation. “If
humbition, honesty, courage and
love were practiced by the people

summate skill in the performer.
The mime never really imitates a
character, but rather he. suggests
or caricatures.

Behind each nuance in the in-
terpretations of Reynders, there
a.re—in addition to his obvious
talent——many years of training,
constant exercise and discipline,
close observation of people and
things, a thorough knowledge of
theatre and music, and his in-
dispensible understanding of hu-
man nature.”

His performance at the ‘Uni-
versity may include, from his
original repertory such favorite
selections as Park Bench, Blind
Man, The Bird, Marionette, The
Tree, The Cello Player, Horse,
Noah’s -Ark, The Tailor, Surgeon,
Samson and the Lion, Boxing

With this point, Dr. Kaufmann
Eontradicted what he had said
previously about absolutism. Ab-
solutism is represented by the
statement, “I am right.” Dr. Kauf-
mann refuted this philosophy and

cademlc -Freedom 

Since we have adopted the trimester system, universi-
Ieso throughout the nation have been observing our prog-
ess. We are recognized as an educational leader establish-
ing a system which many universities will eventually be
orced to adopt because of the increased number of students
pursuing higher education. A r

e : These same universities are now watching us even more
closely‘ because of “the,Colodny case”-—-a case which in-
volves a threat to our academic freedom.

   
  
   
   
  
  
  
   
   
   
 
   
 
  
  
  
  
   
   
   
   
  
  
   
  
 
   
   
 
   
   
   
  
   
  
   
   
  
 
   
   
    
     
    
  
   

’-jstudents realize the seriousness of this situation and what
., -it demands of us as intelligent people. _ '

i We must be strong, uhited and most of all just in what-
‘ ever action we pursue. If we attempt _to'handle this matter
dogmatically or if we’ submit ourselves to irrational beliefs
for if we let ﬁnancial matters influence our decisions, we
have not only failed as a university but we ‘have also failed
‘as individuals. ~ ‘

‘For example, if a student drops a course taught by Dr.
,Colodny, he not only reduces the strength of the University
but he shows his stupidity in accepting the views of our ad-
A versaries as truth before this truth has been established.

yestigate the possibility of Dr. Colodny’s active participa-
tion in a subversive group discover that he is presently ac-
H tivein such a group, then we cannot help but accept the
‘consequences. *

 At the present moment, however, Dr. Colodny’s pwn__
.:strength as a person and the conﬁdence in him as expressed
scholar and an instructor) indicates that Dr. Colodny does
by his colleagues (the best judges. of his ability as both ‘a
hot ﬁt the description that the University’s opponents are
Suggesting.

Concerning the ﬁnancial matter involved in this,‘case,
. these seems to be some fear that being practical may con-
flict with being just._ This may be true. '

At the present moment, the state aid to the University
amounts to $4,000,000. Public opinion, however, is now be-
_ng aroused by outside sources to such a degree that polit-
ical hysteria is resulting. The state, of course, can be pres-N
sured by this group. I S it

Now under the condition that Dr. Colodny is freed from
accusation of a subversive nature“; then one of two things
‘could happen. The public could accept the University’s po-
sition in upholding the integrity of Dr. Colodny as an in-
structor. Or if the University ha.s not remained strong in its
pursuits, the public may pressure the state into, refusing
state aid unless Dr. Colodny is dismissed.

If the second of these two were followed and the Uni-
versity dismissed Dr. Colodny, the University, would com-
mit academic suicide. Since the American Association of
University Professors has stated that they will‘ defend any
‘professor, regardless of his associations, against any at-
tack upon his expression of ideas, from whatever source
_"and however unpopular these ideas may be, they might
back this statement up with mass resignation. The Univer-
sity would immediately be placed on the “black list” of
this organization. The University‘ would then not be able to
get the better professors to come to Pitt. Therefore, the Uni-
versity would most likely not pursue this action, since their
:true'Wealth resides in the upholding of an academic stand-
,ard.

~ g The chances of his conflict arising between being just
V and being practical do exist, but can be avoided if all mem-
ibers of the University support Colodny and the position
that the University has taken in this matter.

The Right to /Crificize  .

By John- Lowenfhol
Thursday: ,  _

L’aifaire Colodny is now in its ﬁfth day, and
for the first time we have had an opportunity to
hear the historian’s views without the intercession
of a newspaper reporter. Dr. Colodny appeared on
the seven o’clock news of KDKA-
TV and answered questions: He
was misquoted and quoted out of 
context by the Press, he said. As i
an historian, it is not his func- 
tion, he said, to pass judgment on 
the Castro regime or any other  
regime, but to try to understand  '
them all. In his opinion the facts_~
about Cuba as reported ‘in the 
American press make such un-.
derstanding very difﬁcult. He _
feels that history may vindicate

   
 
 
 
 
 
  
  

the efforts of Castro, and that Castro’s”feanings, to-

ward Moscow. may have been a result of past

Western mistakes. He feels that historical judgment
of Castro will be passed neither by himself nor by
the respectable forces of ,Rep. Walsh.

Despite this common attitude among conscien-
tious historians, we, a very self-righteous, public,
politic we. have set ourselves up as judges of what
is a proper and what is an improper conclusion for
an historian to draw and state. Dr. Colodny’s views
on Cuba are in marked opposition to ‘the views held
by my teachers, my mother, father, wife, friends

‘neighbors, and myself, and yet Dr. Colodny’s ,views

are wrong only as we are able to prove them wrong
on their objective merit. If, on the other hand, Dr.
Colodny lacks theaopportunity to state his views,
then we, the very respectable and patriotic public,
have no standard by which to judge ours right.

Favors Liberalism

I will indulge in a personal reference. My own
political views are what could be described as “very
liberal”; i.e., I favor big central government, strong
civil liberties, and so forth. Very few local organi-
zations evoke such feelings of disapproval from ,me
as the Society for Conservative Studies. I disagree
with virtually everything they advocate. Neverthe-
less, I recently contributed money to the Society,

,PedaE,gogue,.-Not Anarchist . . 

 

 

simply because I feel that it is vital that conserva-
tive views be heard. My point is that without oppo-
sition from all possible sides, a philosophy soon goes
stale and dogmatic. / _

This danger faces the very philosophy of “Amer-
icanism” today. '
Love of Country

I love America for her material wealth. I love

America for a_ great people. Most of all, though, I =

love America for her staﬂu/nch defense of the liberty
of the human mind and its freedom to communicate
its thoughts to .others. The destruction of these
liberties is to me the destruction of America, for
without these liberties America differs from Russia

only in economic scheme. Encroachments, gradual _

encroachments, upon these liberties is as greatna

“danger to this country,‘ only more insidious, than

(the danger of Russian missiles. I would despise
‘America if her ruler were Hitler or\St_alin.

A It is common sport among us to believe that
while we are wary and sophisticated, our neighbor
is stupid and gullible. While we could’ be “safely”
exposed to any idea at all,.our’neighbor must be
sheltered like an infant. Do we so lack faith in the

appeal of the American system that‘ we fear that-

exposure to another mode of thinking will make
anti-Americans of, all of us? Or even all our

_ neighbors?

Accepi-ed if wise

We have in fact survived many types of ideas

since 1789, and we have found that the great apolo-

gists for America are among the most eloquent and

persuasive men in history. We are in“the great, -'

powerful, and unique position of being able to in-
vite all men to submit their critique of our way.of
life. ‘If the critique is wise it- can be accepted, “if
foolish, rejected. But no critique is to .be feared.

Ifquestionable ideas appeal to the hungry, let
us combat hunger. If they appeal to the ignorant,
we must educate.‘ But liberty, liberty-fora man of
any activities or any associations to speak seriously
on any subject from any point of view, cannot be
denied. For the denial of liberty there can be
no apology.

Freedom's Defense  

By Ina Amdul‘

The real issue of the unfortunate squabble be-
tween thoseiwho wish to keep the youth of Pitt
free from unorthodoxy and the professor, Dr.
Colodny,‘who is accused of being the vehicle of
such unorthodoxy has been ob-
scured by much verbiage and»
little thought. There ‘is a simple
principle involved which‘ was
stated clearly by a professor at
the University. It is repeated
here because it is probably the
most rational point of View
which the writer of this column
has yet heard. We must consider
two things. ‘ V

First, what is the job of the 1
professor? The professor has
been recognized as a member of the academic com-
inunity because he is properly accredited. His main
job is the demonstration of academic competence in

‘ the ﬁeld which he has chosen. The second question

which must be asked. is who is to judge his aca-
demic competence? The answer is, those who have
similar accreditation, in short, his "colleagues. He
is not to be judged by reporters, by seekers of
political office, or by the public. He is to be judged
only by those who work with him and who are in
a’ position to evaluate him.

Entitled to Beliefs .

The question is not what Dr. Colodny believes
at all. It is whether he is teaching well. VA pro-
fessor is not exempted from the dubious privilege
of being a member of the human race. He can be
a Zen Buddhist, an atheist, a radical or a con-
servative. As long as he teaches his subjects his be-
liefs are of no concern to anyone else. It is solely
upon his teaching competence that he should be
judged and the judging should be done by those
who are most equipped to do it. This is a summary
of the professor’s reasoning; the rest of the column
is the 'writer’s opinion.

It must also be remembered that if this con-
flict does not subside it is very possible that a cam-

rhittee‘ will investigate the situation-.~ If the uni-

ti;

 

dents and faculty should be aware of what such a
move would mean to the future of the University.
Many years, ago. the University ﬁred several of its
professors for espousing unpopular views. This
resulted‘ in the placing of the University on the
black list of the American‘ Association of University
Professors.

Should: Dr. Colodny be forced to leave the Uni-
vers-ity, its academic standing will regress to a point
which will obliterate all of the progress made in
recent years. No professor of any stature will set
foot in a university that is on the black list

Disasfrous‘ Outcome \

‘ Another reasonable consequence of Dr. Colod-
ny’s dismissal would be the resignation of the most
outstanding professors at the University. With no
professors here and no professors coming here, the
dark ages would not be far away.

It is up to the students and the faculty, should
the occasion arise, to jeopardize their own positions,
to do everything in their power to make sure that
Dr. Colodny is given the fair treatment which he
deserves. The future of the University is at stake,
not to mention the future of Dr. Colodny. 1

The ‘whole case of the peopleivs. Colodny would
not have arisen in the ﬁrst place were it not a
symptom of the general nature of the society from
which it arose. Again this has nothing to do with

_'"the beliefs of Dr. Colodny of which the present

writer is completely ignorant. It does concern the
fact that the people of thislcountry manifest irra-
tional reactions when they hear the word Commu-
nist, atheist, and the like. They react emotionally
to both of these words and are not content until
those who have shattered’ the naive optimism and
ignorance of their Rotary Clubs have been put in
the proper places, that is, out of sight.

Those who are criticized for being deviants from
the religious and political norms are consistently
victims of those with little religious or political
sophistication. We must rid ourselves of the cliches
which dominate the Americaneclimate of opinion.
We must not forget that should the opportunity ever
come‘ to defend Dr. Colodny, all are responsible for
his defense. Only’ in this way will—anyone’s freedom

Raymond Krotec, Arts ’62: “The

Itzhak Epstein, Arts Sr.: “The
merits of Colodny’s viewpoints
are irrelevant in this case. The
really important issue is that- a
legislator spoke in an officials ca-
pacity without any investigation,
about a man of whom he knows
very little. The same legislator is
trying to force his own prejudices
upon the academic community
through the control of the purse.
It is the academician’s duty to

‘seek the truth and express it de-

spite any popular opinion to the
contrary.”

Ron Caplan, Arts soph: “The
freedom that the Pittsburgh Press
hasrtampered with is the freedom
of responsibility —— it’s responsi-
bility to itself and its readers.”

Janice Horn, Arts '63: “Dr.
Colodny is the most brilliant
professor I’ve ever had. In: his
class, Dr. Colodny‘ did not at
any time advocates communism
or any other form of govern- ‘
merit. Even if he did advocate
it, the student wouldn’t accept it
unless he already had ‘these
leanings.”

Dave Bergholz, Arts sr: “Dr;

Colodny is one of the“ finest teach-

ers I have ever met. Aside from
the article in‘ the Press the com-
promising by the Pitt administra-
tion is hard to understand. The
administration madeithe statement
that Colodny had been investigat-
ed thoroughly before coming‘ to
the University and now the Uni-

versity, under pressure, is being-

forced to re—investigate him. If he

is suspended teachers and stu-

dents will leave the University
in droves.” F

Sy Landy, graduate student in
History: “The University is a
place where all viewpoints should
be ‘expressed and explored. Dr.

HOW SMALL CAN YOU GET?

Today let us address oui'se.lve.< to a question that has long rocked
and roiled the aczidemic world: Is a .<tu(lcnt better off at a
small college than at a large college‘?

To :uisuer this question‘ it is iicce.s.<:ii'y ﬁrst to define terms.
What, exactly, do we mean by a small college? Well sir, some say
that in order to be called truly small, a college should have an
enrollment of not more than four students.

I cei‘ta.inly have no quai'i'el with this ;~:tat<~incnt; a four-
st-udent college must unquestionably be called sinall. Indeed,
one could even call it ’L'/1f’f7II(’ if one knew what intime mcaiit.
But I submit there is such a thing as licing too sni-all. Take, for
iiistance, a recent uiifoi'tun:ite occui'rcnce at Crimscott A and M.

(‘riniscott A and M, situated in a pleasant valley nestled

between Denver a.1idBa:ltimore, vvas founded by A. and M. 

Ci'im.<.cott, two l)l‘0lll€l'S'Wll0 left Ireland ‘in l7()(i to escape the
potato famineof l84l. As a. result of their foi'esiglit,'tlie (7rim-
scott bi‘othe1's never went without potatoes for one single day of
their lives-—a.nd mighty grateful they wore! One night, full of
gratiitude after a hearty meal of French f rics, cottage fries, hash
browns, and au gratin, they decided to show their appreciation
to this bountiful land of potatoes by endowing a college. They
stipulated th.'it enrollment should never exceed four students
because they felt that only by keeping the college this small

\§ .

could each student be assured of the personalized attention, the
cainaraderie, the feeling of b,eloing'iwg, that is all too often lacking,
in higher education.

Well sir, things went along swiimningly until one Saturday a.
few years ago. On this day (,‘-riymscott had a football game
scheduled against Minnesota, its trziditional rival. I*‘ootba.ll was,
of course, something of a problemat Criiiiscott, what with only
four stiideiits enrolled in the entire college. It was easy enough
to muster a. backﬁeld, but ﬁnding a good line~or even a bad
line-- baffled the most resourceful coaching minds in the country.

VVell sir, on the morning of the big game against Minnesota,
its t1'adit-ioiialrival, at capricious destiny dealt Crimscott a cruel
blow——in fact, four cruel blows. Sigafoos, the quarterback,
woke up that morning with the breakbone fever. Wrichards, the
slotback, was unable to start his motorcycle. Beerbohin-Tree,
the wingback—tailback, got his necktie caught in his espresso
machine. Laiigerlians, the fullback, was stolen by gypsies.

Consequently, alas, none of the Crimscott team showed up at
the game, and Minnesota, its traditional rival, was able to score
almost at Will. Crimscott was so out of sorts that they immedi-
ately broke off football relations with Minnesota, its traditional
rival. This latier became known as the Dred Scott Decision.

So you can see how only four stuclents might be too small an
enrollment. The number I personally favor is twenty. How
come‘? Because when you have twenty students and one of

them opens a pack of Marlboro C‘iga1‘et.tes, there are enough to

go around for everybody, and no one has to be deprived of
Mai'lboi'o's ﬁne, mild ﬂavor, of M:.ii'lboi‘o’s easy—di'awiiig ﬁlter,
of’ I\larlboi'o’s joy and zest and steadfast companionship, and
as a i'e..<ult you have a student body that is ﬁlled with sweet
content and aniity and harmony and concord and togetherness
and soft pack and ﬂip—top box.

Yearlings Extend Streak to Six Straight;
Sheﬂield, Generalovich Lead Cuts to Wins

By BARRY EPSTEIN
The Fresh hoopsters stretched their winning streak to six
games as theyrtrounced Kent State, 96-61, Saturday. The
young Panthers, leading 21-17 with seven minutes remaining
in the half, then opened a gap of twenty—four points, taking

a half time lead of 49-25.

Throughout the second half, Coach Carl Peterson rotated

eight men. Six of these reachedO~

double scoring ﬁgures. Topping
the scores were Brian Generalo-

.vich with 18 points, Calvin Shef-

ﬁeld with 17, Dave Sauer with
16, Al Riccuti with 13, and Paul

Krieger and Paul Martha split-
ting 24 points.
In Wednesday's encounter

with the West Virginia Fresh-
men, the Blue and Gold year-

lings received a standing ova- ,

tion from the crowd as they
knocked off an unbeaten Moun-
taineer club 87-79. High scorers
for the Panthers were General-
ovich with 25 points, Sheﬁield
with 21, and Sauer with 17.

Throughout ,the ﬁrst half, the
young Panthers struggled to keep
even with the Mounties. Lacking
offensive rebounding, they were
forced to settle for only one shot
at a time as Mike Berger and
Tom Lowry controlled the boards
and the ball game for the Moun-
taineers. The Cubs were able to
close the half with a seven point
deﬁcit, 42-35.

The second half began and the
freshmen came alive. Generalo-
vich scored twice as he stopped at
the foul line and fired quick jump-
ers. Sheiiield scored on a lay up

Neiger Optiinistic
After Opening
Loss to Navy

When a team gets beat by such
a wide margin as 66-30, as was
the case with Coach Warren
Neiger’s Panther gymnasts in
their opening meet of the season
aganist Navy, the season would
likely be considered a lost cause,
but such is not the case with Nei-
ger and Panther gym followers are
hoping he’s right.

“I feel that we had an awful
lot of tough luck against Navy
and the sophomores had a real
good case of the jitters too,” an-
nounced Neiger right after the
Navy disaster.

At the moment Neiger and his
assistant, Jim Zailey, are busily
preparing their forces for the Pan-
thers' second meet Of, the cam-
paign against Army. This battle
takes place at the Field House on
Saturday afternoon at 2 p.m.

break as both teams traded bask-
ets. Then with Iess than three
minutes remaining, Cal Sheffield
broke through on a drive and the
Cubs were ahead to stay.

With two minutes and twen-
ty-nine seconds left, Sheﬁield
fed off to Sauer who hit with a
long jumper. Mike Barger scored
six straight points for the Moun-
taineers asthe yearlings coun-
tered with two shots by John

throws by Al Riccutti.

Tom Lowry for the Moun-
taineers converted two free
throws, Sheffield hit a basketfrom
the foul line. Jenkins, who was
fouled by Lowry who left the
game with ﬁve personals, con-
nected with two more free throws.

With the cagers leading 84-71,
Riccutti rebounded Barger’s shot
with 11 seconds left. He passed
down court'to Generalovich who
drove through three defenders,
scoring as he was fouled. “Gen-
eral" converted the three point
play. The game ended with a
long jump shot by WVU’s Jaye
Deitz. making the score 87-79.

their main performer. Army is
tutored by Tom Meloney who
coached the 1960 USA Olympic
team in Rome.

“Army just did get by Syra-
cuse 49-47, and this has me a bit
confused,” Neiger stated. “I don’t
know if Army is weaker than
they were last year or if Syracuse
had a good day, which no doubt
was the case,” added the Panther
boss.

Victory Comes In Overtime

Spotlight in 80-75

Victory

By JIlVI O’BRIEN

The underdog Panther roundball party staged two rallies‘

this past week, neither having
incumbent West Virginia ﬁve

any political afﬁliations. The
was obliged to retain their

supremacy over the Cats to uphold Mountie tradition, best-
ing their hosts last Wednesday at the Field House, 73-68.
But in the shadow of Independence Hall in Philadelphia,

the birthplace of American in-Cb
dividual rights. the Panthers re-
Volted against Temple. 80-75, to
attain equality in the record books,
7-7.

The Panthers were trailing at
the Palestra on Saturday night,
67-57, with 6:54 to go, but they
refused to submit to the Owls,
and they fought into a 67-67 tie
wtih 3:13 remaining. The strug-
gle was tied at 71-71 when Don
Steinhart made a ﬁeld goal with
1:18 left. Neither team ‘scored in
the remaining moments and the
ﬁlibuster went into overtime.

‘ Foley Hits

Jim Foley, an infrequent visitor
to the cage wars, hit a jump shot
with 1:37 remaining in the over-
time to push the winners ahead,
75-73. Then John Fridley rose to
the occasion and blocked two
straight Owl shots from bending
the nets.

Ben Jinks and Steinhart each
added two more points and
Coach Bob Timmons _was dis-
playing his banquet grin. Stein-
hart was the leading patriot of
the hour, canning 23 points-—
his season high.

The Carnegie senior, who could
be the key to the second half of
the season, also snatched 15 re-
bounds. Jinks and Fridley totaled
.19 and 14 points respectively, and
Tom Maloney added 12.

Relenting Efforts

Late minute rallies do not al-
ways succeed, however, as shown
by the relenting efforts of the
Mounties a few days earlier. De-
spite a poor start, which prevent-
ed the Panthers from getting a
big advantage on the southern
visitors, the Cats played probably
their finest game of the year, yet
had to submit to the favored

was tabulated. \

Although the game was oili-
cially an away game for the
winners, they actually had more
support in the stands than their
hosts, with one particular boost-
er yodeling from the crest of the
bleachers. ' _

The Panthers succeeded in stop-
ping the highly publicized Rod
Thorn, holding the prolific scorer
to a mere 8 points, but that wasn’t
enough as Lee Patrone and Jim
McCormick assumed the leader-
ship roles with 19 and 17 points
respectively. With only 3:25 re-
maining, the Cats trailed by two
points. 64-62.

Then the game was officially de-
cided. Coach George King had his
team maneuver the L‘-all for two
minutes before shooting. McCor-
mick grabbed a pass and hit on
a driving hsot, but it was clear-
ly evident that he had taken too

didn‘t.

Coach Rex Peery’s matmen
got back on the right track
Saturday as they held oil‘ the
Wildcats of
20-6. Again Coach Peery
shifted his wrestlers around
to diﬁerent weight classes and this
time he was successful. ‘

Peery moved Daryl Kelvington,
John Zolikoﬂ, Jim Harrison and
Augie Arrigone up one weight
class and the first three did not‘

Dave Osmun was inserted in the
137 pound class and came up with
a 4-3 win over Tom Wonders.
Osmun, a sophomore, now has a
2-1 record. ~

Match Sewed Up

The 157 pound battle sewed up
the match for the Panthers as
Zolikoif remained undefeated by
beating Don Millican 5-4. This
was Zolikoff’s fourth win of the
year and 12 straight dual meet win
without a loss.

Dick Martin got the Panthers“

Larry Lauchle kept the Cats on
the winning trail by shutting out
Mick Sawyer, 5-0'. Lauchle, who

He downed Northwestern’s John

In the next two bouts the Wild-
cats gave the Peerymen a little
trouble. Arrigone, who unde.r nor-

in the 147 pound class, lost a close
3-2 decision to Al J::l<liCl1 in the
177 pound class.
Then in the heavyweight clash,

Rory Weber, the Wilkes tourna- ‘ .*

The Panther matmen now have
a 3-1 record with only two

By TED COLTON
Sports Editor

 

Ditka, Pitt’s great All-American end, was honored at a
hmcheon last Thursday at the Hilton Hotel. The Associated Press
presented Mike with the AP All-American awardpand WIICH gave
Mike a special plaque which listed all of Mike’s achievements dur-
jng the’ past year. .

Besides these two awards the big end was subjected to lavish
praise from such dignitaries as Governor Lawrence, Mayor Barr,
Chancellor Litchﬁeld, Frank Carver and John Michelosen.

As Mel Alberts, the toastmaster, was introducing each speaker
who in turn"would heap words of praise on the Hammer, Mike’s
head would get -lower and lower. It looked as though the big end
wouldhave rather been out on a football ﬁeld pulling a 220 pound
guard than be sitting there receiving all those words of praise-

There was one member at the speaker’s table, however.

whose head was not bowed. That was Mrs. Ditka, his mother. In-

. deed. she was a very proud woman. When called upon to make a
‘ speech she femininely declined.

' Alberts did a good job as toastmaster, at one point he ‘intro-
duced Coach Michelosen as one of the faculty and asked him what
subject he was teaching. A voice from one of the tables chided “de-
fense.” Michelosen just smiled.

Others on hand to honor Mike were former All-American Joe
Walton, now with the Washington Redskins, Coach Bob Timmons,
Carl Aschman, Mike’s high school coach, Ed Conway, WIIC news-
caster, and Gib Staley, AP director.

' When it came Mike’s turn to speak» he very humbly said.
"I guess you people get tired of hearing me say thank 370“ but
again I would like to, say it. Thanks. You know all of this
wouldn’t have been possible if it weren’t for the people in this
room. \

,“In order to be an All-American you have to have people writ-

,__ing about you. You people’ wrote all. those stories about me and I

At

guess somebody believed them. ,

Mike went on to thank‘ his mother and Coach Michelosen and then
commented, “But everything, that I am today was made possible by
a bunch of fellows who deserve a lot of the credit. My teammates.
No player can become an All-American alone. He needs the help of
everyoneihe plays with. These guys are a great bunch of fellows and
I consider it an honor to play with them.” _

He concluded, "And you know, out of all the honors I have re--
ceived, the one that thrilled me the most was being selected captain
by my teammates.”

«The applause broke out for a great football player, a firie gen-

tleman and a tremendous representative of the University. If ever a

3Pitt athlete deserved to be honored, it was Mike Ditka.

tory for the mermen.

The only other Panther group
to win any first place points was
the Blue and Gold 400-yard

Warnes, Barry kent, Dick Rush,
and Bart Haas, teamed up to
capture the only other victory.

“Although the boys tried hard,”
commented Coach Grady, “Mary-

They have a strong team with
depth which is our main weak-
ness.”

Although the Panthers captur-
ed the majority of the second and
third place points, the Terrapins
first place_honors were too» much

decidedly bigger and supposedly
better than ever. Almost eighty
teams are entered in nine differ-
ent leagues, each pointing toward
winning the A1l—Campus -Cliam-
pionship in the post-season tour-
nament.

A ‘full nine-game schedule is

set for tonight in the stadium;

gym, with three games Starting ;gave the Panthers high hopes but

at 6:30, 7:30 and 8:30 Monday
through Thursday. Each week will
show a similar card.

Three fraternity leagues,
three independents, and one
each from the dorms, Engineers
and Public Health complete the
circuit.

“The increase in teams,” says
league director Dave Starrett, is
probably due to the increase in
resident students. At any rate,
we’re doing our ‘bit to curb juve-
nile delinquency.”

 

Consideration for the other fel-
low always pays dividends in the
long run.

against communism. and all new-
comers to the faculty are screen-
ed caret'ull_v. ,

“When the loyalty of a faculty
member is questioned, we should
take cognizance of it. At the same
time, we should protect the inter-
est of the general public, the in-
terest of the University and the
interest of the accused individual.
An independent fact - ﬁnding
group should be appointed to sift
the accusations thoroughly, yet
promptly, so that all concerned
will be protected fully.

“In regard to the questions
raised concerning Dr. Colodny,
the University is moving in this
direction. A fact—ﬁnding commit-
tee of respected and distinguished
individuals and « outside legal
counsel have been appointed to
collect facts. The rights of all are
being protected. I believe this is
the fairest method upon which
sound judgment can be based. In
the meantime, until the committee
reports, let no one pass judgment
on Dr. Colodny."

Dr. Wilbur I. Newstetter. dean
of the Graduate School of SOClal
Work: “I feel Dr. Litchﬁelds re-
cently released statement regard-
ing the Colodny incidmt is most
commendable and appropriate. In
view of the action in the State
Legislature, the appointment of a
suitable University Committee to
go into the matter is timely and
appropriate.”

Dr. James A. Crabtree, dean of
the Graduate School of Public
Health: “I agree 100 per cent with
the steps Chancellor Litchﬂeld has
taken to deal with the Colodny
incident. I agree because it is the
only sensible and digniﬁed way to

deal with a matter of this type. .

Namely we ﬁrst should determine
what the facts are and what the
charges are. It is dangerous to try
to settle this issue in the news-
papers. The concept that we live
under is that everyone is inno-
cent until proven guilty.”

Dr. F. S. Cheever, dean of the
School 01' Medicine: Chancellor
Litchﬁeld has my wholehearted
support and commendation for
his forthrightand fair statement
concerning Dr. Robert G. Colod-
ny. The Committee (Mr. Powers,
Mr. Lockhart and Professor Ol-
son) which he has appointed to
investigate the matter has my
complete conﬁdence.”

Dr. D. Richard Wynn, assistant
dean of the School of Education:
“Lord Macauley observed sagely
that ‘Men are never so likely to
decide an issue wisely as when
they discuss it freely.”

“Our universities, like our
newspapers and legislatures, must
remain citadels in protection of
this free discussion.”
