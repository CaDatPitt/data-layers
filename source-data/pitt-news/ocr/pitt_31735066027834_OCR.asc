The Panther Prints yearbook is in critical condition, and
somesaythetimehascometodecidewhethertocontinue
supporting it or dispose of it altogether.

Despite an aggressive new marketing plan, the year-
book’s debt continues to increase, and the position of editor
is still vacant for next year.

While eliminating the yearbook is “highly unlikely,”
funding problems and lack of student interest have prompted
concern that a traditional yearbook may no longer be viable.

The Student Publications Board, made up of journalists,
students, faculty, staff, and members of the Oakland oom-
munity, oversees both Panther Prints and The Pitt News.
Some fear that because the Publications Board oversees

The first people to arrive at the site
of Satu-rday’s KKK demonstration and
the counter protest were the police, who
had been on the scene since about 8
a.m. While the day was tense, most of
the officers were hoping for a quiet day.

“l was hoping it would snow, since

I have to work today,” one officer said
as he was watching the crowd. “The
level of political commitment goes
down with the wind chill. An unseason—
able storm would be right handy."

ing before the Klan. Standing on Forbes
Avenue were members of the Workers
World Party holding signs for Mumia

Some say that conservative view-
points have been ignored at Pitt for far
too long. One student, Mike Long, said
he’s taken it upon himself to change
things.

This change was Long’s goal when
he, as vice president of the College
Republicans and newly appointed
assistant chair to the SGB Community
Relations Committee, stood up at a
CRs meeting and called for more con-
servatives to get involved in student
government.

Long spoke to the CRs in late
February about the Community
Relations Committee and its plans for a
diversity week at Pitt.

“Frankly, I don’t see what [the
SGB’s current plans for diversity week]
have to do with the vast majority of the
campus population, and I would like to
see more CRs active in this so it does-
n’t end up celebrating male lesbians;
not a slim minority in the name of
diversity, because diversity never

seems to include conservatives,” Long
said.

Since then, it seems his caustic
remark has been heard loud and clear at
Pitt, especially by the groups targeted
in his rhetoric. BiGaLA President
Christian Baker believes that Long’s
sentiments are fueled by the fact that
Long feels “threatened” by the homo-
sexual lifestyle.

Reaction from SGB was more var-
ied, including that of the then chair of
the Community Relations Committee,
Shanna Blau claimed that Long “did
not have the authority to speak for the
Community Relations Committee.”

Long would not back down from
his statements, though. Instead, Long
said he was using them as an exaggera-
tion, to demonstrate the dangerous
effects of continuing to ignore the con-
servative voice in a hypersensitive
political climate. According to Long,
this is especially true on a campus like
Pitt, which he said caters to the needs of
left-wing diversiﬁed groups.

Police 

_ Abu-Jamal.

the police [are supporting the Klan],”

A older, balding man inside the
counter protest compound began shout-
ing that Abu-Jamal was a cop killer and
deserved the death penalty.

“He’s pro-police,” a police photog-
rapher said, “just mouthy.”

As police ﬁnally escorted the short,
balding man away the photographer
told her cohorts, “That was probably
our one supporter in the whole group
and they took him out.”

This sense of siege seemed to be
shared by all of the approximately 300
Pittsburgh City and Allegheny County
officers who were covering the down-
town area in an effort to avert a riot.
While no federal agencies were
involved, police intelligence ofﬁcers
from other cities around the country
were in Pittsburgh to look for profes-
sional agitators and others with out-
standing arrest warrants.

When one counter protestor began
shouting about the fourth amendment, a
county ofﬁcer on the outside of the
buffer zone told one fellow inside that
he was scared by that
kind of talk. The ofﬁ-
cers joked with one
another about who
would make a speech
in response to the

‘ fourth amendment
shouting.

The Klan was
delayed for an hour
before it arrived.
During this time, the
officers watched the
counter rally grow and   
tried to prepare for the coming trouble.

“And ladies, this is called the hard
hat with the clear face shield,” one
female officer said as she mockingly
modeled her riot helmet for her fellow
officers.

Despite some joking on the part of
the ofﬁcers, the three-foot riot batons,

L flak jackets, and helmets gave them an

imperious appearance as they formed
the line before the protestors. Another
officer asked her superiors for rubber
gloves, and a box was placed on a
garbage can in the buffer zone. On
either side of the protestors, the police
stood by in riot gear with clear plastic

T shields and batons. The Pittsburgh

police do not ordinarily issue pepper

ii spray to their officers, but every other

officer on the line within the buffer

zone was issued pepper spray to give

them an option other than their clubs.
When he was brieﬁng the press

' before the rally, Chief of Police Robert

W. McNeilly was almost prophetic in
predicting the behavior of the protestors
and Klan.

“People on both sides try to use the
police to their advantage. The Klan will
thank the police to make people think

   
 
 
 
   

THE PITT NEWS 3

 

McNeilly said. “In other cities counter
protestors will chant things like ‘Police
and Klan go hand in hand,’ and we get
stuck in the middle.”

Although McNeilly did not know it
as he was brieﬁng the press, the crowd
had already set up that chant in one sec-
tion of the counter rally.

At the end of their rally the Nazis
and the Klansmen did indeed thank the
police. Edward Foster, the grand dragon
of the Klan, apologized to the police
because they had to deal with blacks,
and Steven‘ Bowers of the American
Nazi party called the police “good peo-
ple” and told them that they had done a
“good job.”

This was the only place that the
Klan and the city government were in
agreement. With only three arrests
made and only minor injuries report-
ed, the police accomplished their stat-
ed mission of ensuring everyone’s
safety.

As the rally wound down, some of
the police who were standing on the
line between the counter—protest and the
Klan rally were con-
fronted by the counter
protestors.

Two black men were
asking two black offi-
cers how they could
protect the people who
represented an organi-
zation that lynched
their ancestors. The
cops just listened sto-
ically to what they
said, not giving any
- -- - response.

When asked what they thought of
the lecture they had just received, one
of these ofﬁcers said “I’ve heard it all
before.”

Another officer, sitting to smoke a
cigarette after the crowd dispersed, said
that he was glad the day went the way
he thought it would.

“I didn’t expect much trouble. I
think it was a pretty good crowd under
the circumstances. I think they did real
well,” he said.

The chief of police, the mayor, and
the sheriff of Allegheny county were all
happy with the performance of the offi-
cers. When asked to assess the perfor-
mance of his officers, McNeilly said,
“My officers behaved themselves well.”

Officers who were stationed on the
streets between Grant Street and
Market Square were in good humor
after the rally.

“I think they were expecting people
to come through and break windows,”
said one Allegheny county police offi-
cer. “We didn’t have any of that. It was
a good day.”

At about 3:40 p.m. the officers said
they expected to be on for another 10
minutes or so. The crowd dispersed
quickly and quietly, for the most part.

every year. Panther Prints has never been
able to support itself on sales alone, but it is
still trying.

This year,’ the Pub Board and Panther
Prints launched a ﬁve-year plan to market
the yearbook. The plan involves direct mail-
ing to parents, advertising on shuttles, ﬂyers,
posters, newspaper ads, sale tables on cam-
pus, a banner over Forbes Ave., T-shirts, and
contests.

The plan managed to raise sales from
420 books last year to 630 this year, but that
is still far short of the goal of 1,100 set by the
plan. Tom Waseleski, the board’s Panther
Prints committee chair, said that goal was
unrealistic, and he doesn’t know where it
came from.

VV1th the revised goal of 700 books, the
projected deﬁcit is $22,000. In recent years,
the subsidy has dwindled, while the deﬁcit
has increased.

Jackson said he is concerned that if
administration forces the Publications Board
to come up with money on its own, the board
will use funds earnexl by The Pitt News,
which is able to support itself on ads.

Waseleski, board member Harry
Kloman, and yearbook adviser Jim Tynen
said that while such action is theoretically
possible, it is highly unlikely, and they would
not support it.

Jackson said that thinking Pitt’s admin-
istration will never cut the yearbook is naive.

“Whatmakesthemthinkthatanadrnin—
istration that is willing to cut graduate pro-
grams isn’t willing to cut a yearbook to save
money?”l1e said.

Yolande Campbell, the Pub Board’s
chair, said the real problem facing the year-
book is not the funds, but that the personnel
committee has not found an editor for next
year.

“It is disappointing to know the com-
mittee didn’t believe in [the yearbook] and
didn’t try to ﬁnd someone to do the jo ,”
Campbell said.

Jackson, who is also chair of the per-
sonnel committee, said there is no new edi-
tor because no one has applied for the posi-
tion.

“Yolande likes to dump a lot of this on
my shoes, but as I understand it I can’t spend
the Panther Prints money [for ads] to get new
people to apply, and I can’t give out free
advertising in my newspaper,“ Jackson said.
“I thought standard procedure, what I was
supposed to do, was recruit from within.”

Jackson said no current staff members
wanted the job of Panther Prints editor, and
ﬁnding someone from outside the staﬂ° has
not worked, either.

He said two people came forward say-
ing they would take the job if no one else
would, but when they saw the dept the pub-
lication had sunken into, they retracted their
offers. - -

Another part of the problem is the year-
book does not reach many students any-
more, according to Jackson and Tynen.

“We want to give people a yearbook
they can believe in,” Jackson said. “Now we
have to get this idea past an apathetic publi-
cations board”

Tynen blamed a large part of the year-
book’s troubles on a “tremendous lack of
interest” on the part of the student body. Few

are interested in buying it, and even less want
to put the time into producing it, he said.

Every year the staff starts with 20-30
members and dwindles to only a handful
who put most of the work into the book’s
production, Tynen said.

Waseleski said he is not panicking about
the fate of the yearbook just yet. He said the
lack of an editor is not unprecedented. He
believes the yearbook will have an editor in
time and that the marketing plan just needs
more time and work.

“I think the book is doing as well as it
can, facing the kind of obstacles it does,” he
said.

Pitt’s yearbook is not the only one fac-
ing personel‘ and debt troubles. All over the
country, particularly at large, urban universi-
ties, yearbook popularity has drastically
decreased

Tynen said students don’t have the same
sense of community anymore, and anyone
can buy a camera to take pictures of their
ﬁiends so they don’t need to spend $30 to
$40 on a book of people they don’t really
know.

‘The market and the interest just aren’t
there,” Tynen said.

Campbell said it is too soon to judge the
success of the ﬁve—year plan, pointing out
thatsalesareup andthe plan is onlyinits ﬁrst
year.

But Tynen, Jackson, and others still say
they have doubts.

Panther Prints increased sales by a large
percentage, but only with great effort and a
high cost. Tynen said the plan was excellent
in that it revealed selling is much harder than
the Panther Prints staff suspected

“Marketing isn’t magic,” he said. “Huge
corporations spend billions of dollars in mar-
keting, and still their products sometimes
fail.”

Tynen and Kloman said they believe ‘
only a permanent source of ﬁmds for ﬂie

yearbook will save it. Even then, changes in
the fonnat may be necessary.

“Ithinkallofushavetobeconcemed
about whether this book can continue in the
traditional format,” Tynen said.

Waseleski said he would be receptive to
changes so long as someone within the
Panther Prints organization proposed them.

He said he is reluctant to impose them on the

staﬁ° outright.

Jackson said the problem with that is
that students do not know they can make
those proposals.

He has suggested plans for alternatives
to the traditional hard—backed yearbook, but
he said the Board has not been receptive to
them. His ideas include a “best of the year”
paperback which would include senior por-
traits and highlights from The Pitt News.

This idea, he said, would not require
separate staff and could be sold in the book-
store at a much lower cost than the tradition-
al yearbooks.

Jackson also suggested yearbooks cus-
torrrized to the different schools within the
University which he said would increase the
book’s marketability since it would cater
more to speciﬁc student interests.

Other ideas considered included a
paperback traditional book, a yearbook pro-
duced by the University’s in-house duplica-
tion service, video and CD—ROM year-
books.

She cites as an example the refusal of
the CRs to participate in MTV’s “Choose
or Lose” voter-registration campaign last
fall in front of the Student Union. Long
was quoted in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazett
as saying, “[Choose or Lose] is shrouded
in the name of voter registration, but it’s
something else altogether.”

Long said the refusal of the CRs to
participate in this event emanates from
the message behind “Choose or Lose.”
He said it is arming students with the
tools needed to vote without educating
them about the issues. He said that the
participation in this event by Michael
Stipe, the lead singer of REM, is evidence
of the hidden agenda of this campaign —
a mechanism that spouts liberal voters.
He also points out that the founder of this
event is Ann Lewis, one of the managers
of the Clinton-Gore election campaign.

The cost of the crusade

Long’s “crusade” and his comments
made in a public forum may have been
costly. On March 31, the selection com-
mittee, composed of four SGB members,
voted to replace Blau — who resigned in
mid—March —— with two co-chairs, Kelly
Meyers and Ralph Dunniehigh, both of
whom have no previous experience on
the Community Relations Committee.

: Long had been acting as interim
president until a replacement for Blau
was found. Long, acting under the
assumption that he would be named to
replace Blau, prepared a proposal for the
committee for next year and submitted it
to SGB board member Marquette
Bowman, the SGB liaison for the com-
mittee.

Long said his assumption that he
would get the job was based on a conver-
sation he had had with SGB President

Personal History

Long, a junior at Pitt who commutes
from Zelienople, said his values were
shaped more by his Catholic religion than
by his parents. He maintained that it is his
own self-education that has shaped his
political views.

“I think I’ve shaped my own ideals.
I’m a political junkie. I love reading
about it. I love watching political shows,”
Long said.

He can speak extensively on a wide
variety of issues that face students, not
just at Pitt, but at campuses everywhere.
Long said the liberal bias that is present at
many university campuses is part of what
has fueled his campaign at Pitt.

Long said he was also inﬂuenced by
his membership in the Young Americans
Foundation, a group aimed at helping.stu-
dents fonn conservative groups on carn-
pus. Their guidebook, “The
Conservative’s Guide to Campus
Activism,” is what Long plarmed to use
to counteract student apathy at Pitt and
get more students involved.

The book describes in detail the lib-
eral inﬂuence that is pervading college
campuses across the country and, in par-
ticular, the efforts of one professor at Yale
to inﬂuence the political ideologies of his
students — to make them liberal. It is
also a guidebook for students looking to
form their own Republican groups.

Long said proof of this trend is the
efforts by students at Penn State to form
the group STRAIGHT, a group aimed at
countering homosexual activities on the
campus. Long said the group was denied
funding by the Penn State allocations
committee because it was viewed as a
dangerous entity that might lead to anti-
homosexual discrimination or even vio-
lence.

“I can’t understand how the alloca-
tions group has the right to say what

_ political stance, includ-

 

groups should and shouldn’t exist based”

on what they think is going to happen,”
Long said. “That group had the right to
exist.”

Long said he relates to the battle at
Penn State. He claims there is also a dou-
ble standard at Pitt with regard to free
speech in that, if liberal groups were to
stand up and call conservatives names, it
would be regarded as free speech, but if
the CRs made comments about groups
like BiGaLA or the Campus Women’s
Organization, it would be an infringe-
ment on a student group’s speech codes.

Intimidation in the classroom

Long said he first became aware of
“liberal bias” at Pitt during his freshman
year, when he and other CRs showed up
at a rally against the Contract With
America and began shouting, “Newt,
Newt!” -

“I saw a lot of animosity directed
towards us when we did that,” Long said.
“People tried to have us arrested. From
that point on, I saw that for a college carn-
pus to say that it’s open to all viewpoints
and ideologies  it’s really not towards
conservatives.”

Long said that he and other CRs are
intimidated in what they believe are the
mostly liberal classrooms on campus and
that conservatives are
afraid to speak up in
classroom discussion
because once people
ﬁnd out that someone
is a conservative, that
person is often
harassed.

“I’ve been called
every name possible on
campus because of my

tron.

But Baker disagreed.

“Homosexuals are the victims,”
Baker said. “During the Holocaust, Jews
and gays had a triangle [sic] put on them
that said, ‘They are inferior; treat them
worse.”’

Long contended that part of the rea-
son that conservatives feel intimidated on
campus is that there is a small sector of
students on campus who have a control-
ling inﬂuence over everything and that
many Pitt students are apathetic and
unwilling to get involved.

“The vast majority of the population
either doesn’t care, or they don’t like it.
There’s a small number of groups on
campus that run activities and really

they’re the controlling ideology. Groups ‘

like [Campus Women’s Organization],
groups like BiGaLA,” Long said.

He cited the planning of events like
diversity week as an example of their
inﬂuence. “Diversity seems to only apply
to ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation,
and gender, and it
doesn’t apply to ideol-
ogy.”

Baker agreed
but said that there is a
controlling ideology on
campus. However, she
continued the string of
victimization claims by
saying the dominant
ideology is conserva-
tive, not liberal.

contradicted what “Look at all the money
Long said about the that is given out for
political climate at Pitt. Greek Week.”

Both turned the issue 1nto a contest to
see who has been victimized more.

Baker said that she, too, has been
harassed on campus and called names,
not because of her political stance, but
because of her sexuality. She describes
one instance on campus when, while
walking in front of the student union with
her girlfriend, she was harassed by two
men, who called them “dykes” and used
other derogatory terms. She reported the
incident to the campus police, but no
charges were filed.

Long said he disagrees with the polit-
ical tactics employed by groups like
BiGaLA and Act Up, who, he said, por-
tray themselves as victims and target the
Catholic Church because of its stand
against homosexuality.

“I caution those who say homosexu-
als should start comparing themselves to

CWO Co-President Margot Douaihy
was equally perplexed by Long’s
remarks.

“That’s just absolutely not true,” she
said. “It’s amusing. We don’t really have
a lot of ﬁnancial pull on this campus.”

Baker said she feels strongly that the
University should continue sponsoring
events that celebrate diversity because “at
least 10 percent of the people on this
campus are gay and lesbian.”

Despite Long’s description of the
struggle of conservatives on a liberal
campus, he said he plans to continue his
crusade. Long plans to apply to law
school and said he hopes to pursue a
career in politics. For now, though, he
said he plans to spend his next few years

Yearbook must pul
in the sails to save
  the sinking ship

The Panther Prints yearbook has amassed a
$17,000 debt. A pitifully small number of students
buy it, and an even more pitifully small number of
students work to produce it.

What can this ﬂailing publication do to pull itself
out of the hole? .

First of all, the yearbook needs to come up with
an effective plan to become self-sufficient within the
next five years. The current plan’s a start, but relies
solely on marketing to increase sales and the money
from those sales to bring the yearbook out of the
hole. That plan is naive. What the yearbook needs is
a new format and a new approach to business and
finance.

A new format would include changing the year-
book from a clunky, hardbound volume to a snazzier
paperback edition. This softbound volume should
include senior photos, candid shots of campus life,
and highlights of the year pulled from top stori_es in
The Pitt News. ‘

The yearbook will need a strong editorial staff,
including an editor for next year and a strong staff of
photographers and writers to put together a yearbook
that students and their families will want to buy.

There is no proposed editor for next year, and
there hasn’t been any visible effort to find one. The
personnel committee of the Publications Board needs
to quit postulating on how to find an editor and get
off their butts and do it. If they do not have an adver-
tising fund to run ads in The Pitt News, there are
inexpensive ways to advertise. Post fliers around
campus, set up a booth in the Union, and talk to the
art and journalism departments to find people inter-
ested in going into publishing.

If the Publications Board approved a new format,
it would make the personnel committee’s job of
attracting people to work for the publication much
easier. The yearbook’s current format is outdated.
Make it into something that people can use to gain
marketable work experience.

From the business end, the yearbook should be
easily -accessible for students to buy. Instead of forc-
ing students to buy a yearbook sight unseen, the year-
book should be sold by actual copy ——as opposed to
idea form — in the bookstore and at graduation.

Financially, there should be a business staff
which handles the money end of the yearbook. It
would be the responsibility of this staff to find spon-
sors and ways of bringing money into the yearbook
that would be separate from the revenues brought in
strictly from sales.

The yearbook is a sinking ship in need of a great
deal of repair. With the proper direction and focus,
the yearbook could become a marketable entity which
both students and their families would be more than
willing to buy.

SGB should see
students don’t care

I’m tired of the SGB citing
student apathy when it comes to
trying to get support for the clos-
ing of Bigelow Boulevard.
Maybe they should get the hint
that the closing of Bigelow is a
big deal for them but not for the
rest of the University. That could
be the reason why only seven
people took the bus down to the
City Council meeting to voice
support for the closing of
Bigelow.

Parking and driving are bad
enough in Oakland without
blocking off a street. If some of
the students don’t like crossing a
street to get to their classes,
maybe they shouldn’t have come
to an urban campus.

Student's rebuttal
not CGS council's

Thank you very much for your
attendance at the last three CGS
Student Council meetings and for
your coverage of our discussions
regarding the possible restructuring
of CGS/SGB. In addition to our
monthly information line, “The First
Degree,” The Pitt News gives the
entire Pitt community the opportu-
nity to keep abreast of our Council’s
concerns and interests on a day-to-
day basis.

However, the article appearing
in the March 26 issue, which reports
our March 24 meeting, contains
serious misinformation. I would
appreciate your publishing this cor-
rection. The CGS Council DID
NOT make a statement concerning
the opinions column written by
Nena Ansari and printed in The Pitt
News Tuesday, March 18. The

Union, Pittsburgh, PA 15260. Letters should be kept to 250 words and must
include the writer's name, phone number, and university affiliation (it an ).

 

rebuttal to Ms. Ansari’s column was
composed and read by Marjorie
Carlson, one member of the

Council, as her personal statement.

The rebuttal only officially reﬂects
Carlson’s feelings regarding
Ansari’s column. I PERSONALLY
applaud Nena Ansari for having her
own opinion and being forthright
and brave enough to voice it pub-
licly. I wish more of us would have
the integrity to care so deeply and
take a public stand more often. Nena
Ansari spoke out without first
checking to see who her allies were
or how many would support her.
She had strong personal convictions
and publicly stood up for what she
believed to be right. We all have the
right of free speech. We need more
people like Nena Ansari who care
enough to exercise that right. And
the following is from me PERSON-
ALLY... thank you, Nena, for setting
such an admirable example and for
keeping us all accountable.

Two weeks, folks — that’s all
we have left this semester. Two
weeks to ﬁnish that term paper (or
should I say to start it?), two weeks
tocatchuponallthereadingthat
wasn’t covered on the midterm (or
that we hadn’t done in time for the
midterm), two weeks to try and
remember " everything we
crammed for and then forgot right
after the midterm, and for many of
us, two weeks before saying some
goodbyes.

It seems to me a wonderful
paradox that two weeks can seem
so brief, and at the same time, can
seem an eternity. If your past year
has been anything like mine, it
probably seems incredibly long,
and at the same time, it couldn’t
have started but two weeks ago.
Whenltlrinkofalltlretlringstlratl

haven’t done in the last year, I

wonder how on earth I can do
everything that I have left in the
two weeks that remain.

On the other hand, if I think
about what it would be like to be
locked in a closet for the next two
weeks, it seems like forever! VV1th

ime shoiulclforce us to jog to

nothing else to do, I might like to
sleep for two weeks, and that
might pass the time pretty quickly.
But forgetting about hibemation
for now, because it is, after all,
spring, two weeks in a closet
would be unirnaginably long.
Time is funny that way:
Forever is brief, and this moment is
an eternity. We all
say we’d like to
have more time,
but how many of
us are willing to
lock ourselves up
in a closet for two
weeks just to feel
like we have an
eternity to do our
work? Not many.
We’d probably go crazy if we did
it. (Although, now that I’ve put the
idea out there, don’t be surprised if
you see a few closet-dwelling cults
popping up here and there! Well,
come to think of it, maybe you
won’t be able to see them.)
Besides that, who needs eter-
nity? The most inﬂuential thing
about this universe in our lives is
time. It forces us to move, to jog if
we want to keep up, and if we want
to get ahead, to run every now and

then. Many people see time as a
kind of predator who will eat us
alive if we’re not careful, but that is
a very unhappy view of things.

Time should be our closest
companion. It should remind us to
keep moving, not because we have
to, but because there is so much to
see in this life. Trrne should remind
us to cherish
every moment,
because we will
never have that
moment again.

“Okay, Kris.
Lots of metaphys-
ical mumbo
jumbo just now,
but what are you
trying to tell me?”

Well, I have just a few sugges-
tions to make our next two weeks,
and possibly our whole lives, real-
ly, really good:

First, don’t get caught up
mourning how little time there is.
There’s plenty of it if we use it
well, and the less time we spend
mourning its brieﬁress, the more
we can appreciate its precious rari-
ty by using it.

Second, live in the moment,
but don’t try to live in the moment.

 

I only recently realized how, in this
case, trying and doing are mutual-
ly exclusive options. You can’t
appreciate these times if you’re
already sad that they’ll be over one
day. I ﬁnally ﬁgured out why
Adam Duritz sounds so sad when
I heard him sing, “I can’t remem-
ber how many times I’ve tried to
tell myself to hold on to these
moments as they pass.” You can’t
hold onto these moments, and
you’ll waste them by trying.
Third, even in the face of an
insurmountable pile of things to do
and no end of work in sight as
ﬁnals approach, don’t forget your
ﬁiends. College is an amazing
place; you can meet people here
who become like family. I have
found it almost frightening that
some people here could come to
mean so much more to me in four
months than most people did in
high school in four years. Whether
you’re saying goodbye to someone
you may never see again, or just to
people you won’t see until the fall
term, remember your friends now.
Remembering them now is far
more important than remembering
them when they’re gone, because
at least now you can share more

 

Tuesday, April 8, ‘I997

with them to remember later on.
Of course, I’m not saying to
neglect your classes in the process;
ﬁiends and classes both need atten-
tion now, but it is very easy for
some people to neglect classes in
favor of friends, and easy for some
to neglect friends in favor of class-
es. We should all try not to fall into
either category, because if we do,
then one day, we will regret it.
And ﬁnally, be happy. I’ve
had many graduates and teachers
tell me that these are the good old
days that I’m living in right now.‘
Elders often say that it only gets
harder after this. The Hindus say
that, in general, everything just
gets worse with time. And my
11th—grade physics teacher used to
say, “Cheer up! Things aren’t as.
bad as they’re gonna be!” So,

remember to play hard, ﬁght;

entropy, and enjoy every moment
of it, because moments are all we
have, and like Soul Asylum sings, '
whether you realize it yet or not,
you’re gonna miss this when it’s
gone.

Kris Kissel would really like to
hibernate for the next two weeks,
but he is afraid he might miss some-
thing.

Hey Republicans, it's Congress —  not the WWF 

 

Stop me if this story sounds a mite bit
familiar. An American political party was in
desperate need of cash for 1996 and came
up with a cynical and unethical, if technical-
ly legal, strategy for collecting money. Have
an extra quarter million bucks to spend?
Well, for that amount you can sit with party
VIPs at a fundraiser. For $100,000, big shots
in the party will let you have breakfast and
then get your picture taken with them. But if
you only get an allowance of $45,0()0, don’t
wony at all. For that much, you can have a
little lunch with the party leadership and
“Senate and House committee chairmen of
your choice.” I know what you’re thinking:
It’s the Democrats and the Clinton White
House right. Wrong! It’s an example of the
tactics that the Republican Party’s fundrais-
ing machines uses to shake down donors.

When the cunent scandal broke after
the ‘96 election, the Republicans were fast
to get on the attack. Despite having won
continued control of Congress, they were
sore at having lost to President Clinton.
Prior to the election the Republicans point-
ed triumphantly to the fact that they had
won ﬁve of the last seven elections and con-
ﬁdently wrote off Clinton as Jimmy Carter
II, just a brief anomaly in what they saw as
their era. Now with President Clinton’s vic-
tory, they were forced to explain why since

Watergate they have split the last six elec-
tions. When word came out about the presi-
dent’s dubious fundraisin g tactics, they were
given a golden excuse to explain the failure
of the American people to support th.eir ide-
ology: Clinton stole the election!

Unfortunately for the Republicans,
facts began to leak out to the American pub-
lie about their‘ shady fundraising tactics.
GOP Senator Don Nickles led the attack on
President Clinton until it was disclosed that
in 1990 Senator Nickles had sold a visit to
Vice President Quayle’s oﬁicial residence
for $1,0()0. Congressman Dan Burton, the
chairman of the committee investigating the
Clinton White House, might be in serious
legal trouble when it was disclosed last
month that he had threatened to cut oﬁ
Capitol Hill access for a lobbyist unless that
individual gave $5,000 to Burton’s re-elec-
tion campaign.

These ethical disclosures have severely
embarrassed the Republicans and taken
away their ability to raise serious ethical
questions about the president’s fundraising
tactics. “Republicans need to recognize the
fact that this is perilously close to the kind of
thing we’re criticizing President Clinton for
doing,” noted one Republican congressman
who is critical of the hypocrisy of the GOP
leadership.

It is ironic that despite all of these scan-
dals and the media's jackal-like pursuit of
investigating any and all perceived viola-

tions of the law, President Clinton’s
approval ratings are as high as they ever
were. Fifty-nine percent of the American
people approve of the way the president has
done his job. Whenever my Republican
friends express amazement to me about the
fact that the American
public doesn’t seem to
care about President
Clinton’s ethical woes, I
point out to them that the
Republican Party leader-
ship has only itself to
blame. In its single-
minded (and somewhat
paranoid) quest to por-
tray President Clinton as
an evil yuppie bent on
destroying the United.
States, its leaders have
taken innocent blunders
by the administration
and blown them up into
sinister plots. As a result,
when a real ethical viola-
tion by the Clinton administration emerges,
everyone simply thinks that it’s more GOP
hot air. The Republicans have become the
boy who cried “Wolf!”

The word “Watergate” has been used
more times in the last four years than it was
all during the 1970s. Just a few weeks ago,
Newt Gingrich called the White House’s
fundraising efforts “the most systematic,

large—scale effort to get around the law that I i
think we’ve seen, certainly since ‘
Watergate.” Gingrich is contradicting him— 1
self slightly, since he declared last July that 
the “scandal” involving missing FBI ﬁles at 7
the White House was “going to be a bigger I
scandal than Watergate ‘
was.” Senator Alfonse
D’Amato, a man not
exactly known for his
sense of integrity and
ethics, said in 1994
about Whitewater, ‘This
is worse than
Watergate.” Gee, do you
think that because the
Republicans are so tired
of having Watergate
thrown in their faces that
they want to ‘try to
impeach Clinton and
even the score? No, that
can’t be it. Nobody
could be that childish.

I have a message
for the Republicans: Govemment is not a
sport. You guys are, for better or worse, the
elected representatives of the American peo-
ple. You are not a bunch of gladiators in blue
suits out to battle the Democrats in a C-Span
version of WWF wrestling. Grow up and
act your age.
Michael Berquist wants Congress to grow
up and get a life.

SPORTS

 

They're not
here to

pump us up

 

Like many people, my 1997
began with a resolution.

Admittedly, many of my past
resolutions failed by the time
February rolled around and then
were forgotten by early March. I
tried giving up swearing when I
was 9, candy when I was 11 and
drinking when I was 21.

But this year, I pledged to keep
my resolution for the whole year. I
made a conscious effort to getback
in shape this spring by working out
at Trees Hall four times a week.
For the first time in years, I have
been able to keep up with my reso-
lution and I actually have been
working out.

Yet no matter how much blood,
sweat, and Gatorade I pump into
my workouts, I won’t be able to get
any bigger.

Unfortunately, my size doesn’t
have anything to do with my body
fat or my body weight or my
r.p.h.’s (that’s reps. per hour).

No, I won’t be able to get any
bigger because of the simplest of
problems: Trees Hall doesn’t have
enough weights.

It’s ridiculous to think that a
University of Pitt’s size has only
one major workout facility with a
severely limited amount of weights
and aging machines. I can’t under-
stand how Trees, which is designed
to serve all 22,000 students at Pitt,
can have only two equipped bench
presses. And how many times have
you had to wait 10 minutes in line
to do one rep., or been able to find
only one wobbly dumbbell when
they are supposed to come in sets
of twos?

The University of Pittsburgh’s
official homecoming may be in the
fall, but for many of Pitt’s track and
field athletes, last weekend was a

homecoming weekend.

Most of the Panther track ath-
letes competed at last weekend’s
Colonial Relays at the College of
William and Mary in Williamsburg,
Va. Pitt has 11 athletes who went to
high school in Virginia, most of
them in the tidewater area, where
William and Mary is located. As a
team, the Pitt men finished fifth and
the women were second, but the
spotlight was on the Virginians.

The spotlight was also on the
relay events. In the women’s 400-
meter relay, three Virginians, Joetta
Purter, Kianga Lee, and Jennifer
Williams, led Pitt to a fourth-place
finish. Pitt’s women’s two-mile
relay team was also led by three

Mary Lou Retton in

in 1992. Very few people

the team competition in
any of those years, and if
it weren’t for a munchkin

THE PITT NEWS

' The Pitt baseball team ended
their longest losing streak of the
season by beating Rutgers on
Sunday. The 6-4 final marks the last
time the Panthers have won since
they shut out Villanova on March
29, a span of six games. The win
came after the Panthers (15-13, 5-7
B.E.) played two double-headers
against Rutgers and Seton Hall in
two days.

Pitt playersScott Lobaugh and
Lou Melucci each recorded two hits,
while Chris Delsignore had three
hits, two RBIs, and scored once in
both of Sunday’s games.

In the first contest on Sunday,
the Panthers could not overcome

 

Rutgers’ two three-run innings to
open the game. Starting pitcher
Chris Gallic.k (4-4) was hammered
in those two innings for six runs,
five of them earned, on seven hits.
His replacement, Rob Shaffer, fared
much better by allowing only one hit
in the next five innings. The
Panthers managed to scatter 10 hits
among eight players, but their come-
back effort fell short, and they lost
6-5.

Despite four errors, the Panthers
won thesecond game thanks to three
runs in the ninth inning and with the
help of Delsignore’s two doubles.

On Saturday, the Pirates of
Seton Hall crushed the Panthers 11-
0 in the opener, but could only
squeak out a 2-1 victory in the sec-
ond game.

w‘ Baseball ends 6-game losing streak

The losing streak and the week-
end had been rough on Panther

pitchers. Gallick (4.95 ERA) and"

Eric Rosing (7.76 ERA) each suf-
fered two losses during the previous
seven games. Luckily for the
Panthers, their bats did not do as;
poorly as their arms. In this contest,
Pitt tallied 12 of their 32 hits in their
weekend road trip to the Garden
State.

Sunday’s victory was proof that ‘

the Panthers could come from
behind and win a close game. Three
of the previous six losses were by
one run. Another loss was due to
nine runs scored by a tough West

Virginia team. The Panthers’ next"

game is Wednesday against the same
Mountaineer team that shut them out
a week ago.

Trac k 

and Lee finished in 3:52.01, a time

, which would have placed them third

in the supposedly faster heat.

In team scoring, based only on
relay events, Pitt finished second of
18 teams with 42 points. James
Madison won with 52 points.

“The women had an outstanding
day,” said Pitt Head Coach Steve
Lewis. “Every event the women
entered, they were in the top six.”

The news was less pleasant on the
men’s side. Senior Orrel Green start-
ed out having a fantastic meet for his
hometown crowd. He anchored the
shuttle hurdle relay team, leading
teammates Jeremy Ward, Jack

Jeffreys, and Jerel Williams to a vic-
tory in that event. Green also won the
400-meter hurdles with a time of
51.84 seconds and ran the 400-meter
leg of the sprint medley relay, which

 

finished fourth in 3:23.70.

Then, during his l00—meter race,
Green severely strained his hamstring
and did not finish. He did not com-
pete in the remainder of the meet and
will not compete in the Duke Relays
next week. Green hopes to be back
for the Penn Relays during the last
weekend in April and in top shape for
the Big East championship meet the
weekend after that. ,

“The men were hampered with
the injury to Orrel,” Lewis said. “He
would’ve been in the mile relay. He
would’ve had a strong shot at the top
three in the hurdles.”

With Green gone, Jack Jeffreys
stole the show. Jack Jeffreys was
fourth in the ll0—meter hurdles, but
first among collegiate athletes, with a
time of 14.61. The three runners who
beat him were all unattached runners

 

 FROM PAGE 9  

who are out of college. Two of them
are former all-Americans.

The men finished fifth of 23
teams in the meet, scoring 24 points
in the relay events.

Five Panthers, all throwers, went
instead to the Gatorade Invitational at
the University of Miami.

“We wanted to ensure that they
would have good weather and an
opportunity to be in a place where‘
they could do their best,” Lewis said.

“They don’t always have the best sit- 

uations to perform in.”

Ron Losiewicz placed third in the
men’s discus and second in the ham-
mer throw, with distances of 147-8
and 147-6, respectively. The top
women’s performance in Miami came

from freshman Gwen Knorr, whose .

throw of 119-10 placed her third in T

the javelin event.

 

Column  

Granted I am not an athlete at
Pitt, and I won’t be raking in mil-
lions of dollars that our world-class
athletes do. But I am pretty sure the
football players don’t have to wait
10 minutes to do one set of bench
presses.

I also seem to remember that
«millions of dollars were funnelled
into the football training facilities
to improve their weight rooms dur-
ing the last three years. Judging
from the condition of Trees’ facili-
ties, I doubt that Trees received one
Abraham Lincoln penny to upgrade
the facilities for non-athletes.

If the University wants to
ignore the 20,000 non—athletes at

 

 '  FROM PAGE 9 ’

Pitt, then maybe the students
should take some initiative. Maybe
I could place an empty Polar water
jug outside of the Trees weight
room and accept people’s spare
change as donations for improve-
ment.

If everyone puts in a penny, we
would at least have $200. That way,

I would be able to keep my New ;

Year’s Resolution. And everyone
else could enjoy a brand new bench
press. '

Women's rugby splits
pair of home matches

   

‘Eric Knopsnyder

 

The Pittsburgh Angels women’s
rugby team limped into North Park for
Saturday’s games with Fairmont State
and Rochester missing three starters.
They lost another player in the first
half of the 10-0 loss to Rochester but
rebounded to trounce Fairmont St, 32-
O.

The Angels were without wing-
forward Phyllis Long, ﬂanker Allison
Moore, and scrumhalf Althea Rodgers.
Moore has mono and will probably
miss the rest of the season, while
Rodgers will likely sit out the remain-
ing games in order to concentrate on
her studies. Long has a sprained ankle
and is expected to be back next week.

The Angels faced an experienced
Rochester team in the ﬁrst game.
Rochester, like the Angels, is a club
team, which is a step above the college
level. The game was fairly evenly
played but Rochester scored the only
two tries of the game.

“They won, basically, because of a
breakdown on defense on our part and
not taking advantage of offensive
opportunities when they were there,”
said Angel Kim Nestor.

“We should have beaten them, or
at least made it closer,” said ﬂanker
Erica Love. “We have more speed. I
just think it was an experience factor.”

“Smart decisions come with expe-
rience,” Nestor added. “That is our
biggest problem — not making smart
decisions. We have a lotof offensive
ability, but offensive ability doesn’t
always win games.”

The Angels suffered another loss
when Allison Smith, the hero of the

team’s win over Clarion two weeks
ago, injured her shoulder in the first
half. Smith, who was taken to the hos-
pital, said she does not think the
shoulder will require surgery but she
will probably miss the rest of the sea-
son. ~

The second game pitted the
Angels against Fairmont State, a col-
lege-level team, which had just recent-
ly begun playing women’s rugby. This
gave the Angels a decided advantage
and allowed them to use some players
who would not normally play.

“We put our inexperienced team in
against them, but they were even more
inexperienced than we were,” said
Nestor.

Love scored the ﬁrst two tries of
her career in the game and Lori
Altenderfer and Kim Kluse each
added a try.

“Fairmont was very inexperienced
so we played with uncontested
scrums,” said Love. “With a regular
scrummage there was a chance of
someone getting hurt.”

The decision to have uncontested
scrums was made by the referee. An
uncontested scrum does not involve
the pushing that is characteristic of a
normal scrum and the ball automati-_
cally goes back to the team which put
it into the serum. In

The game will help the team in the ,
future, in that it allowed some younger ,
players to gain experience.

“When we get an opportunity to -
put the less experienced players in, it’s ,
a positive,” said Nestor. 1

The Angels will travel to

Columbus, Ohio, next week for the
Ohio Classic, where they could face
either college or club-level teams. 1

From local and wire services

Pro Basketball

0 The Dallas Mavericks haven’t
been one of the NBA’s best teams
over "the past decade, but they reached
a new level of futility Sunday night as
they set a league record with a two-
point third quarter in their 87-80 loss
to the L.A. Lakers.

Veteran guard Derek Harper’s
two free throws were the only points
for the Mavs, who led 51-37 at the
half. The Lakers went on a 24-0 run to
open the second half.

“I don’t know if there is anything
to say,” Mavs Head Coach Jim
Cleamons said. “I’ve never seen an
exhibition of basketball like that in all
my years in the league.”

- The Chicago Bulls (65-10)
clinched home-court advantage
throughout the playoffs with their
110-94 win over the Orlando Magic
Sunday. '

Michael Jordan, who scored 37
points, including 16 in the third quar-
ter, passed Oscar Robertson on the
NBA’s all-time scoring list. Jordan
currently stands at fifth with 26,726
career points. .

College Basketball

- Colorado guard Chauncey
Billups became the 13th underclass-
man to leave college and declare him-
self eligible for the NBA draft. The 6-
3, 202-pound guard was an All-Big-
l2 selection this year as he led the
Buffs to a 22-10 record and their first
NCAA berth in 28 years.

The sophomore is projected as a
lottery pick by draft experts.

- The Person tradition at Auburn
may be on hold with the recent devel-
opments surrounding junior—college
star Adrian Person, nephew of for-
mer Tiger stars Chuck and Wesley.

The leading scorer from Southern
Union Community College, who aver-
aged 30 points per game, turned down
offers from Kentucky, Alabama, and
Minnesota to walk on at Auburn.

The Tigers are not allowed to
recruit junior—college players as a
result of NCAA violations in 1996.
Chuck Person has offered to help
Adrian financially until he can be on
scholarship. The assistance is legal-
based on the fact that Adrian does
have a relationship with his uncle that
dates back to before he entered the
ninth grade.

- Lamar Odom, the Parade
Magazine Player of the Year, has
decided to hit the books rather than
head straight to the NBA. The 6-9 for-
ward, who has attended three high
schools this academic year,

. . . . . . . . . . . » . . . . » I . . — ~ . . — . . . ~ . - - a . . . . . - . - — I - — v - - o - -

announced Sunday before the Magic
Johnson All-Star Game in Michigan
that he will play at UNLV next sea-
son.

Odom averaged 25 points, 15
rebounds, eight assists, and three
steals while playing for St. Thomas
Aquinas High School. He scored nine
points in the East’s 94-81 win over the
West in the game held at The Palace in
Auburn Hills.

- Idaho wasted little time in
replacing men’s head coach Kermit
Davis, who hopped down south to
take over at LSU last week. Assistant
David Farrar will be the new head
coach.

Athletic Director Oval Jaynes
said, “ I am pleased that we had some-
one on our staff with David’s proven
ability to lead our program. I feel our
program needs stability and we need
to build the enthusiasm that presently
exists in the program.”

0 Providence Friars fans are beam-
ing with the announcement that
sophomore guard God Ghamgod will
not leave early for the NBA. The AP
in Boston reported last week that a
source close to the program heard that
the 6-0. 165—pound guard who aver-
aged 10.4 points and 6.7 rebounds last
season would forego his final two sea-
sons in the Big East.

Baseball

- New York Mets right-handed
pitcher Pete Harnisch, who was sup-
posed to start the Mets’ game in San
Francisco Sunday, will meet with Dr.
Allan Lans, a psychologist and the
team’s director for employee-assis-
tance programs.

Harnisch, who has been battling
an addiction to smokeless tobacco,
contracted Lyme Disease in 1995 and
has recently suffered from insomnia
while trying to kick his habit.

Pro Football

-The Dallas Cowboys finally got
some security in their secondary after
they signded safety Brock Marion.
The 26-year-old had been headed to
Baltimore but the Ravens nixed the
deal due to Marion’s injured left
shoulder. The safety fractured his
shoulder in November against San
Francisco.

Hockey

-New York Rangers Captain Mark
Messier will miss the team’s final
three regular season games as a pre-
cautionary measure. The center suf-
fered a deep charlie horse last week
and wunderwent an MRI Monday.

The Rangers are competing with
the Pittsburgh Penguins and the
Florida Panthers for the fourth
through sixth spots in the Eastern
Conference Playoffs.
