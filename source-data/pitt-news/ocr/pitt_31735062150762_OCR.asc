(giiestion: What happened to Stark’s third

Again, nutmeg is not the correct answer, but.
somany crazy things have happened that any.
thing may be responsible.

Solution: Ernie Rose is chairman of the 1937-
38 exe_ci,itive' committee of SFA. He is a dental
2',‘-.ltl(l.f.’i‘lV_l. He pulls molars in his spare time. Next
year ti‘. molars will take a back seat, may even

Educating The Politician
IT IS.most depressing to view the state of affairs
in our University political circles. A student
government isn’t expected to do much in the
form of legislation, for most of the “business"
could be even more efficiently taken care of by
a dean’s committee that would dole out the com-
mittee and sub-commit-tee positions that a stu-
dent government goes to such lengths to effect.

There is, however, one thing that a student gov-
ernment could do, and that thing is to teach a few
of the better political ideals and practices that
the graduate will face when he steps out into
United States government circles, whether it be
state, local, national, sewing circle, or lodge elec-
tions.

First on the agenda for today's discussion is
the matter of party allegiance. If a man or woman
belongs’ to a party, it is understood by virtue of
that fact alone, that he will support the policies
and act for the best interests of that group. When
he ﬁnds he is no longer in agreement with those
policies and standards, then he should leave the
fold, and ﬁnd a group more to his liking. We
operate on. the principle, at least, of majority
rule. That majority rule usually ends in minority
rule, we do not care to argue at this time.

However, the point we wish to make is this:
that under a democratic government we must
have organization at election times, between elec-
tion times, at all times. “Democracy” means peo-
ple working together, acting in the interests of
the general welfare. If it is dictatorship or an-
archy that you prefer, then you may say, to quote
the words of a person we talked to the other day,
“I'm not in favor of politics. I think a person
should vote according to what he personally
thinks.” That person was a member of a student
political party, and was put into office on the
votes of that party. Such a statement is nothing
short of dictatorship.

' O ANALYZE: when the person in question
was elected to that position it was done en-
tirely by virtue of the support of the people who
had the conﬁdence and assurance that the person,
if elected, would act in their interests. In short,
the successful candidate represents the people
who make the election possible. A public servant
cannot rationally represent himself. There is a
deﬁnite pledge and understanding that he or she
(the elected candidate) will serve the best inter-
ests of the particular public welfare in question.
It has happened before in really important elec-
tions that after the candidate has been elected,
he or she forgets all about campaign and election
promises or “understandings” and acts in his or
her own interests. It’s happened here at the ni-
versity more than once. One year ago there was
a classic example. Before that, during the
Bracken era, a Lennard Marks was deprived of
the presidency of student government when one
of the Independent executive committeemen
“switched” sides at the last minute after the can-
didate had clearly been elected by the Indepen-
dent party. There was ultimate justice in this
case, as is the general rule in the long run, for
Marks ascended to the presidency on the resig-
nation of the elected man early in the year and
the man who switched parties saw himself de-‘
feated for reelection in the general elections the
subsequent spring.

We repeat once more, it has happened many
times at the University. It happened last night
in at least two instances. P e r h ap s it was
through ignorance of the code. If that is true,
then we, much like the average American poli-
tician, need education along the best democratic
lines. Can a University admit that it produces
men and women who intend to enter the political
ﬁeld ut_1sc_‘ho,,ole_d in fundamental rules and ethics
ofthe ganiefwhen we boast ﬁne political science
curriculums? How can we expect our average
citizen to use his vote intelligently if our future
reputed leaders and voters are receiving advanced
training that misses ﬁre on some of the funda-
mental principles of living well with men in the
particular neighborhood?

FA, AFTER IT has educated its members in

-political fundamentals, should do the follow-
ing things:

1. Elect its officers by straight majority rule
(a vote of the entire assembly).

2. Organize its members into a party or parties
that will be supported by a few planks that will
hold its members aﬂoat, whether the planks be
social, political, or scientiﬁc in nature.

3. Then gradually attempt to educate the peo-
ple who surround them in all forms of activity.

>3: S: a:

Campus NOllC€
ALL PROSPECTIVE and past office seekers

should understand that by campaigning for of-
ﬁce though it be merely the placing of a name on
a ballot that candidate places himself in a posi-
tion for both the censorship or acclaim of the
constituents. Newspapers and other forms of
publications carry this even further to the extent
that laws of libel are virtually ignored in regard
to the publicization of political personages. It is
most difficult, if not impossible, to defame the
character of, or otherwise libel, any man who runs
for public office.

Journalists Get

Keys, Hear Talks

By NICK SPANOS

Last Monday evening the Cathedral Mansions was the
scene of what was genera.ll.y conceded to be the most
riotous publication's banquet to date. Chief purpose of
the annual publications banquet  to recognize out-
standing members of business and editorial staffs. How-
ever, the affair usually turns out to be a “Gridiron”
event with heckling and good-natured disorder running
rampant.

Keys for members of The Pantlier staff, campus humor
magazine, were passed out by Miss Irene Matveak.
chief 6?-(—l1l11‘t101‘lSt. Miss Ma.t.veak gave awards to Irene
Matveak, John Glasser, Martin Barrett, and Sanford
Anderson. These particular keys were of reputed gold
and were given in e:>;cl1a.ugc for three years service on
the P3.IllCl1£‘:1‘.

Others who received silver Panther keys for two years
work were: Robert Saffron, Robert Ruttencutter, Ben
Wayne Baskin, Dick Cooper, Joseph Resnick, Leo Grif-
fith, }.‘}1‘nes't. I-lolmok, Juno Greene, Tom Smith, and
John N. Downic.

Dave Racusin presontml the keys for the Pitt News.
The News gives only one type of key and those to re-
ceive it were: Herb R.ackofI', Loo Kcberlein, Janies

Yesterday’s election of Ernest Rose as president of
SFA marks the first open extrance of administrative
officials into student politics.

When two large groups of students elected to the
assembly chose the present executive committee, they
attempted, to the best of their ability, to select the most
capable and outstanding members to do the actual work
of student government.

But they left to these “outstanding” men and women
the job of choosing one from their membership to be
their president. Eacli party chose the man who it knew
would be its most representative candidate, being willing
to leave the final decision to the “unbiased wisdom” of
the administration.

It therefore came as an unwelcome .;~11!'pri.’-'3 that
Theodore W. Biddle, assistant dean of men, should nom-
inate a third candidate, a man who was elected as an
Independent, to be sure, but who had the support only
of a small minority of the Independent minority group.
To put it plainly. two of the thirty students in SFA
favored R034‘, and our of them was Rose liiniself.

It was even more of a siirpise when Rose, a member
of the third, or Biddle party, actually was elected. Now
what?

From now on, it appears that future Boss Barrs, Ham-
burgs, and McQuades will have to reckon with a new
opponent in Doss Diddle.

500-Page Book
Represents Two .

Years’ Research

By MILTON G. LEHMAN
On October 4, 1935. the following
article appearerl in The Pitt News:

"In preparation for the coming ses~
quicentenuial anniversary on Febru-
ary 28, 1937, of the founding of the
University. Mrs. Agnes L. Starrett,
assistant professor of English, has
been asked by Dr. John G. Bowman,
chancellor of the University, to organ-
ize and write a detailed history of the
University from its beginning as Pitts-
burgh Academy, through its re—estab-
lishment as the Western University
of Pennsylvania, and concluding with
the development of the University on
its present site.”

In ‘two weeks (publication date has
been set for June 1), Mrs. Starrett’s
500-page volume, “Through One Hun-
dred and Fifty Years: The University
of Pittsburgh” will be placed on sale.
Dr. Bowman, in his introduction to
the history, says:

Facts Almost Lost

“The author has recorded facts,
many of which were upon the verge
of being ﬁnally lost. Far more impor-
tant, she has recaptured from the
facts the seeking to know life. She
has written with understanding that
education is learning to live in the
world of youth ﬂooded with curiosity,

wonder, and gladness . . . ”

Divided into four parts: “lnto the
Wilderness, 1787-15519;” V “In the
Smoke, 1819-1890;” “Above the

Smoke, 1890-1937;" and “Schools
and Research Divisions,” ‘the volume
is as complete as all the letters, dia-
ries, and documents could make it.
Besides being a scholarly production,
the volume has that ﬂavor and vitality
that can come only from a deep inter-
est and understanding in the work.
Mrs. Starrett, who seems to be
half-interpreter, half-historian, has
culled the romance of 150 years, bur-
nishing the de'tails with a lucid style
and a keen perspective, and presented
the first complete history of the Uni-

Banquet
Ends Debating
Season

The University debating season
will officially come to a close next
Wednesday evening, May 26, at the
College Club, when members of the
Men's and Women’s Debating Asso-
ciations gather for their annual ban-
quet.

Toastmaster for the affair, which
will begin at 6:30 o'clock, will be
Miss Theresa Kahn, instructor in Eng-
lish and coach of the Women’s De-
bating team. Three students, sched-
uled to speak during the evening are:
Marcella Leyton, C37 ; Ruth Shapiro,-
C37; a.nd Robert McKee, C37.

A series of skits will be presented
by Lea Goldstein, C39, and Mary Jane
Patterson, C39; Milton Lehman, C39,
and Bernard McKenna, C39; and by
Ben Siegal, C37.

Miss Leyton and McKenna, both
of whom have been active in varsity
debating during the past season, are
co-chairmen of the affair.

‘Barn Murder’  
To Be Given
Tonight

In the Cathedral's penthouse this
evening a man will be murdered.

John Weisbrod, C38, will be the
murderer. The motive behind the
crime will be the German Club’s pres-
entation of the melodrama, “Murder
in the Old Red Barn” at 8 o'clock
tonight on the 36th floor of the
Cathedral.

Besides playing the villain, Weis-
brod is in charge of the direction,
make-up and costuming for the play.
Assisting him in roles of corpses and
other parts are I-lerbert Parties, C39;
Gertrude Broido, C40; Lillian Shriner,
C40; and Albert Kock, Ed38.

Villain Wcisbro~d has had a great
deal of experience with the melodram-
iner. Last summer he was a member
of the company that kept the Hotel
Schenley lawn theatre busy for over
two months.

Although the club’s version of
“Murder in the Old Red Barn” will
be in German, only an elementary
knowledge of German is necessary
for comprehension. The exaggerated
gestures used in a melodrama also
are used by the club actors to bridge
any language diﬁ'icul'ties the audience
may have.

Dancing and refreshments will fol-
low this evening’s performance.

Alumni Hold
Final Meeting

The Business Administration Alum-
ni Association of the University will
hold their ﬁnal meeting of the year
on Thursday evening, in Room 144,
Cathedral, according to the announce-
ment made by E. A. Batchelder. sec-
ret.a1*_v. Installation of offit-ei*s for the l
year 1937-38 will be held at the meet- 
ing. ‘
Dr. Daniel Jamison, head psychia-3
trist at the Mayview City Hospital,9[
will speak on “Psychiatry and thel

Criminal.”

"“rversity after two years‘ research and.

composition.

“Through One Hundred and Fifty
Years” appears to be just that: an
exacting resume that seems to be all-
inclusive. The volume takes us up
from the one-room building, when
Judge Hugh Henry Brackenridge
made his first plea for the chartering
of the Academy, to the Cathedral with
its ramiﬁed curricula and extensive
faculty.

‘More Than Just Elements’

“The real beginning of the history
of the University of Pittsburgh,” the
author begins, “is in the plans and
hopes of the men who assembled in a
log house near the Point to talk about
a school that would teach ‘more than
just the first element.s;’ . . . Notices of
trustees’ meetings printed in the early
newspapers, a few letters, and entries
in diaries are the only records of their
deliberations.”

The men who met for the meeting
of incorporation prepared the first

«plans for the Academy that was to be-

come the University. Judge Bracken-
ridge preceded their activity by ob-
taining a charter for the Academy on
February 28, 1787.

Students in the Academy,” besides
noting the election of George Welch
to "the office of principal, a legend
that has appeared in the student hand‘-
book for years, traces the history of
the school up to 1819, including the
literature and principles of education
of the period.

Master Writes to Pupil

Introducing chapter four, “The
University of Pennsylvania West of
the Mountains,” is a letter dated July
16, 1819, from Joseph Stockton, prin-

timony,” the author points out, “t6

‘the relationship between master and

pupil and a challenge to the Universi-
ty today.” On February 18, 1819, the
Academy became ‘the Western Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania, or WUP,”7re-
ceived its charter. A  .

From chapter ﬁve to eight,;;.i. the
history brings back the names of R_ob’-I
ert Bruce, John -Black, Father Mal-,

pranks, the ﬁrst commencement cere-

monies, and the; addition of new
courses to the school. _

burnt the school to the ground is cov}
ered in chapter nine. “The fire of
1845 started at noon, April 10, when
a shed on the east side of Ferry street
was ignited by a spark from a ﬁre
over which a woman was boiling her

disastrous than the first, made it nec-
essary for the school to suspend ac-
tivity for ﬁve years.

“Pittsburgh, at the turn of the cen-"

tury, with bank ﬁgures that no other

community of its size could equal, 1,

wealth measured in hundred millions,
was not a sophisticated city," Mrs.
Starrett writes. The beginning of “so-.
phistication” may have been fur-
thered by the opening of the Carnegie
Museum and Library in the Schenley
acres. And, without much doubt, the
advent of William Jacob Holland and
Alfred Brashear as chancellors of
WUP helped to raise the standard of
culture in industrial Pittsburgli.

School Develops Rapidly

From that time on, development
in the school was rapid, and the his-
tory of Mrs. Starrett becomes more
detailed. Highlights are the terms of
Chancellor McCormick and Chancel-
lor Bowman; the departure of one at
the time when the University needed
more room for its classes and more
economy in its budget, and the advent
of the other who solved both prob-
lems, conceived the idea and saw the
construction of the Cathedral of
Learning.

The book is too complete and com-
pact to list any‘ but the primary dc-
—.ta1ls. If we may dare to pass’ judg-
ment, we might say that Mrs. -Star--
re.tt’s history will never be the book
of the month, but it most certainly
will be the book of one hundred and
ﬁfty years. ' ' A V’
