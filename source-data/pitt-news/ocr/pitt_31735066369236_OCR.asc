Stan Galanski, a member of Pitt
Student Government Board, has
been elected A president of that
organization by ‘a 60.vote margin
over Drew DiMaccio.’ I ’

Galanski, who pulled out the
1061 to 1001 victory over Di-Maccio
will take office on Feb. 1. Galanski
lead throughout the race with the
exception of the first day, when
DiMaccio lead 216 to 193.

“It was a good race,” Galanski
said. “Because of the close margin
between Drew and myself, it was
easy for the voters to see the

difference in the candidates.”
Galanski said that his first
priority will be to sit down with the

- board. members to see what their

priorities as a board will be. For
the first time in some years, the

7 board is two-thirds female.

“I’m very happy to see four
women on the board,” Galanski
said. “I’m not being sexist, but I
think it presents a diversity that is

i really needed.”

During his campaign Galanski
said that he would work for
changes in the Pitt Union Program

"Council but only after studying the

entire council and the areas that

-most need restructuring.

‘ Galanski also advocated the

\ iﬂi

“73 Years of Collegiate Journalism ”

Student Union rennovation project
but said that students should not be
forced to pay for any of these

rennovations, noting that many

ﬂoors in the building are occupied
by university administrative off-
ices.

Throughout the campaign, Gal-
anski has also been a stringent
supporter of the ' Public and
Governmental Relations Commit-
tee and its lobbying efforts.

The president-elect also continu-
ally cited how the "Undergraduate
Academic Review had been distri-
buted to the students. Galanski
believes that the review would be
far more effective ‘if it were
distributed in a hardcover edition

 

and placed in major distribution
points across campus such as the
libraries.

Galanski’s running mate, Todd
Park, won his position on the
Student Government Board in a

" landslide victory over the other

board candidates with an un-
precedented 1205 votes.

“It’s now my job to sit down with
the board candidates and get these
people oriented to the job of being
a board member and to adjust
myself to the role of president,”
Galanski said. ‘ ‘It’s a different role
for me because I don't only have to
be representative of the students. I
also have to be representative of
the board.

Todd Park, Rita Cordisco, Helen
Gianella, Kim Watterson, Tom
iunkel and. Cindy DeMatteo will

join Student Government Board
M-president-elect«Stan Galanski on

the 1979-1980 board.

The results, announced early this
morning, give the board an
unprecedented two-thirds female
majority.

The shoo-in candidate was Todd
Park, whose 1205 votes out of 2058
cast totaled 136 votes more than
Galanski.

Park’s overwhelming victory
gave the election an ironic twist
since he was originally declared
ineligible for the ballot by the
board’s Elections Committee after
turning in hisacademic transcript

ﬁve minutes beyond the 5 p.m.,
Dec. 11, 1978 deadline.
‘An appeal before the SGB
Judiciary by Park was won on
Jan. 5, placing his name on the
ballot almost four weeks into the
six week election campaign.
“I’m very pleased with the
outcome -of the race,” Park said
after learning the results. “I’d like
to thank everyone involved in my
campaign.”
“My first priority upon assuming
board membership will be the
renegotiation of the Pitt Union

said. “Secondly, I will talk to Josh
(Baylson, present board president)
to take a realistic look at
Undergraduate Academic Reviews
and see what improvements can be
made,”Park said.

Many of the elected board
members, gathering in the SGB

office after results were announ-
ced, said they were happy to see
four women included. V 1

Helen Gianella, finishing third in
the tally with 747 votes, stated,
‘‘I’m very happy to see four girls on
the board.”

Also given the voter’s okay in the
election were several amendments
to the board’s constitution.

Of New Course Offerings Counci|Approves

with an interest in the field an
opportunity for exposure.

Dr. James G. Lennox of the
department of History and Philo-
sophy of Science proposed a course
titled, “Between Myth and
Science.”

An addition was made to the
newly-formed Religious Studies
major, with the acceptance of two
courses, ‘ ‘ ‘Early Christianity’ ’ and
“The History of Catholicism in the
United States.”

These additions were welcomed
by the council following discussion
by the administration -that the
present major did not incorporate
enough study of the Christian

religion into the program.
Dr. K.J. Kansky of the depart-

‘ment of Geography proposed a

course titled, “Comparative World
Urbanization.” This course will be
aimed at introducing students to
patterns of urban development,
planning world-wide strategies and
policies, and understanding econ-
omic problems that are concerned
with rapid, unbalanced urban
growth.

The final course that was
approved was submitted by Dr.
William Hans of the Speech and
Communications department.

the Pittsburgh area. It will be
limited to those junior and senior
students who receive special
permission from the instructor.

CAS Dean Irwin Schulman also
discussed with the council the
future of _ the ’Altemative Cur-
riculum program. Schulman said
that the program cost his ofﬁce
approximately $10,000 last year,
excluding faculty salaries. At the
present time there are 20 students
enrolled in the Alternative Cur-
riculum program, _a drastic drop
from the enrollment at the

inception of the program.

Members of the council sug-
gested that Schulman ask the

Alternative Curriculum advisors, *
Hanson Kappleman and Gail.

McGloin to address the council on
the pros and cons of either
continuing or terminating the
program. Such a move would be
required by the administration’s
push for a massive cut in spending
by. the Faculty of Arts ‘
Sciences.

If all budget cuts thatihave been
the College would be operating

with approximately $1 millionless
than it operated with last year.

Area Fast Food -—
” Something For All

By VINCE ORNATO Jr.

Editor’s Note: In the search for
the best lunchtime restaurant in

‘ Oakland, Vince Ornate Jr. visited

the area links in the local franchises
of Roy Rodgers, George Aikens,
McDonalds, Burger King, Burger
Chef and Arby’s. Conclusions are
based on food quality, customer
services and cleanliness.

If speedy service is a prime
consideration at lunch, the best
place to eat among the restaurant
chains in Oakland is Roy Rodgers
Family Restaurant. But if you have
a few minutes to spare, try George
Aikens.

“The food quality at Roy
Rodgers is excellent compared with
other fast food chains. We buy
better quality food,” said Robert
O’Connor, vice president in charge
of Pittsburgh area Roy Rodgerses.

The major difference is that Roy
Rodgers uses fresh products, not
frozen. They spend over two
dollars per pound for their beef,
which is from the inside round,
according to assistant manager
Gary Sita. The meat arrives in a
sealed plastic bag and isn’t
removed until it is to be cooked.

Roy Rodgers has had the reputa-
tion of being a roast beef place, but
the chicken and hamburgers are of
matching excellent quality. The
chicken is fresh and prepared in the
store. ' i

The chicken did not sell well until
two years ago when Pitt’s football
team won the national champion-
ship. The store gave away two
pieces of chicken to any Pitt
student and sales skyrocketed
afterwards, according to O’Connor.

The Roy Rodgers hamburgers
are made from fresh ground beef,
not frozen patties. One popular
item is the Double R sandwich It
is a hamburger, chipped ham and
cheese combination with delicious
results.

Roy Rodgers also butters all
buns for extra ﬂavor, something
the other chains do not do.

The popular dessert item is apple
cheese crisp. This is baked apple
mixed with cheese and cinnamon.

Roy Rodgers has delicious fresh
food in its burgers, roast beef and
chicken for approximately two
dollars per dinner. The service is
fast and the workers are friendly.
A hostess is always on hand to
clean the tables and help customers
with any problems.

The major selling point of
George Aikens is its staggering
variety of fresh food. According to
manager John Baverso, the huge
selection is at the expense of
loosing some speed in the customer
receiving his order but the overall
result is worth it.

The daily lunch menu includes

fried and barbequed chicken, at

least four types of seafood, a large
variety of sandwiches, vegetables,
at least five different salads,
beverages and fresh pies, among
other choices.

“At least 90 percent of the food
is fresh daily,” Baverso said. “All
of it is prepared in front of the
customer. The fresh : is prepared
from scratch.”

The prices are reasonable.

“If you want a full meal, buy the
platters or the daily $1.35 special,”
Baverso advised.

George Aikens strives -for a
friendly, informal atmosphere -
among its workers and encourages
them to take the time to know
Customers on a personal level,
according to Baverso.

“We want you to think you
walked from your kitchen to your
living room when you get your
order and sit down,” he said.

This is not shelved philosophy
but is carried out daily by ‘the
employees. Although the service is
not as speedy as other places, it is
not for a good reason.

“We do a constant business,”
Baverso said.“Look, if you want
that fast 60 second hamburger, I
wouldn’t eat here. But if you want
anything else at all for lunch, this is
the place.”

Among MacDonald’s, Burger
King and Burger Chef, the raw

O quality of their burgers is the same

because they all sell 100 percent
U.S. grade A meat shipped in a
frozen patty. The difference in the
restaurants is found in customer
service.

Experiment

The circus is over.

At 1:45 a.m. today, the results of ‘the Student
Government Board elections were known.
Board member Stan Galanski was elected president

, The
Noble

in a close race against Drew DiMaccio. The six new
board members are Todd Park, Rita Cordisco, Helen
Gianella, Kim Watterson, Tom Kunkel and Cindy
DeMatteo.

It was not only a victory for the winners. The Of-
fice of Student Activities adopted a new course of ac-
tion this year to increase voter turn-out over the
dismal 1978 showing of approximately 1,500 studen-
ts.

Student Activities’ strategy for increasing the voter
turn-out for the Student Government Board elections
paid off. Some 2,058 students voiced their opinions
during the four—day voting period—roughly a 19 per-
cent increase over last year’s.turn-out.

However, we wonder if Student Activities’ means
justifies the ends——namely a board where only two
members have previous experience in Student Gover-
ment. 1

In an effort to increase the number of voters,
Student Activities began with an avalanche of adver-
tisements which billed the campaign as a gift that the
possible candidate deserved. Retribution for public
service is certainly desirable but putting an elected of-
fice on par with snatching the brass ring on a merry-
go—round is tasteless--to the candidate,
student body, and, most of all, to the office involved.

Friday, January 26, 1979--Page 3

What defines a winner is a question that has posed .

countless theories and evaluations. There are no
more easy answers there than when one ponders what
inspires a candidate. In past editorials, we have
deplored the lack-lustre line-up that was offered to
student voters this year and we wonder if, in part at
least, Student Activities’ crass way of pushing
students to the polls was not responsible.

It is too late to criticize the 1979 election and too
early to determine if an inexperienced board will in-
deed prove incompetent. But now is the time to ask
Student Activities to plan to add a little class by way
of dignity to next year’s election. «

But, we have a sneaking suspicion that if free cokes
and halftime get students to vote, next year, we can
look for anything from dancing bears to A the
Goodyear Blimp.

And so, in a field of 15 candidates, only Park and
Gianella could be judged by past performances. This
is not meant to criticize the remaining 13 candidates
whoshould be commended for their initiative, but
still, it makes us wonder on what criteria they were
‘ judged by their peers and, more importantly, what is
the future of the board with four totally inexperien-

bers?

Voting Fraternities Out—at Dartmouth .

~ , .. By LARRY LUNSFORD

A drastic backward step was
taken recently by the prestigious
Dartmouth College when they
voted 67 to 13 to close down the
college’s 20 fraternities and two
sororities. ' The move by what
supposedly is one of the top schools
in the country is simply unbeliev-
able.

According to “The Chronicle of
Higher Education,” education’s
reputable professional journal, a
faculty spokesman said a majority
of professors want the fraternities
closed because the groups encour-

age heavy drinking and mis-

behavior. “James Epperson, a
professor of English who‘ led the
anti-fraternity drive, said the
groups’ values were ‘antithetical’
to academe,” the “Chronicle”
reported. _ ‘
On the surface, it would appear
that the faculty resolution is illegal.
The proposal will go to the college
trustees for a ﬁnal vote next month.

Should it pass there, my views
ai?91.1t.it1,1¢, .prestige of. Dartmouth-
will decline sharply. , 1
‘My defense of Dartmouth’s
Greek system is by no means an

‘ attack on Epperson’s assertions. I

would be the last to argue that
heavy drinking and misbehavior
does not occur among Greeks.
However, is it not true that heavy
drinking and misbehavior exists in
residence halls and apartments in
the community? Should residence
halls and apartment living also be
banned and students forced to
commute from home? What
impact would this have on an
institution like Dartmouth, which
attracts“ students from all over the
country and world?

The Greek system at Dartmouth
is old and strong. Psi Upsilon came
to the college in 1842, when the
institution was 73 years old. The
1976 edition of “Baird’s Manual of
American College Fraternities”
reports that the college had 22
fraternities‘. Twenty of them
owned their own houses on their
own land and one rented a

college-owned house in 1976.
“Bai,rd’s”_, shows 34 inactive
fraternities on.»-cam.pus.. ,From. a
combined number of 56 fraternities
over 136 years, there exists
thousands of Greek alumni.
Undoubtedly, these alumni are
concerned about the fate of
Dartmouth’s Greek system.-
Alumni play an important role in
policy decisions at most insti-
tutions, especially at private ones
such as Dartmouth. Alumni have
been known to be successful in
ousting college presidents and

Letters

athletic coaches. Money talks and
undoubtedly manygalumni-who look
forward to going back to Dartmouth
for homecoming and stopping by
their old fraternity house for a visit
will not like thepossibility that the
chapters may not be there next
year. I expect the latter to play a
vital role in the trustees’ decision
next month.

The controversial move also has
been the topic of discussion at
various professional conferences
throughout the country this year.
Not only has fear been expressed

about the system at the New
Hampshire school, but an ‘alarm,
has been sounded that similar:
action may occur elsewhere should
the system be abolished. L

The means to solving problems is
not by abolishing the sources. By
refusing .to work toward viable
solutions to alleged problems in
Dartmouth’s Greek system, the
faculty has abandoned its foremost
role as administrators. One can
only hope more professional
concern will be expressed by the
college trustees.

More Questions About Security

The murder that took place a few
weeks ago of a female student had
a very shocking effect on me and
I’m sure the majority of all Pitt
students. Ever since this took place
Ihave never really felt reassured of
the fact that precautions were

being taken to prevent something V,

so tragic from occurring again.

Sure there were extra policemen on
duty in the Towers for a few days,
but what after that? I believe that
the administration and Campus
Police did not take the situation
seriously enough.

'An incident which occurred on
Monday night reinforced ‘my
feeling concerning this matter. I

was returning back to my suite in‘,
Bruce Hall at approximately 12:30

p..m. when I noticed four campus
policemen in the lobby. As I
procededitoi the elevator the desk
attendant stopped me and told me
that a prowler was reported to be in
the building. I did not take the desk
attendant seriously because of the
relaxed atmosphere in the lobby. I
thought if this was true there would
have been more concern for my

safety and that one of the four.

campus policemen would have
offered an escort back to my suite.
This they did not. They just
continued to stand in the lobby and
ﬁnish smoking their cigarettes.
After I was in the elevator, I
became frightened over the fact
that this could possibly be true.
What could I have done to defend
myself if the elevator had stopped
before my ﬂoor and the prowler
was there? By the time I got off the
elevator and ran to my suite,
locking the door behind me, I was
petriﬁed. So much had entered my

mind on that seemingly endless
ride to the sixth floor.

I had not been in the suite for
ﬁve minutes when the ﬁre alarm
had gone off. But this was not our
usual ﬁre alarm. Someone overpthe
intercom was instructing the
students to go to the Student
Union. There were no ﬁretrucks

outside. When I reached the lobby-

with my suitematesi the desk,
attendant veriﬁed that there was
indeed a prowler in the building,
We, the students, were never

informed whether the prowler was .
apprehended or not, but wewere

allowed to‘ re-enter the building
within 15 minutes. Personally I do
not think this was sufﬁcient time
for a thorough search of the
building. 

My purpose for writing this letter
lies within the fact that I do not
think there is adequate concern for
the safety and well-being of? the
student body. Although I was
unharmed, the possibility of
something terrible happening to
me was signiﬁcant. I hope my
purpose will be fulfilled by
awakening the administration and
law enforcers to the fact that there
is indeed a deﬁnite problem and
steps must be taken to secure our
safety. Or where does this leave
the student body of Pitt?

‘Once Upon A Mattress’

By COLLEEN‘ MCDONALD

Once Upon a Mattress
Directed by Henry Heyman
Studio Theater

Ever been to a kingdom where the princess swims the
moat and the king is a mute, where the queen is a
calculating shrew and the prince has yet to learn about the
birds and the bees?

Well, enter into the Studio Theater’s production of
“Once Upon a Mattress.” A comic take-off of Hans
Christian Andersen’s fairy tale, “The Princess and the
Pea.” The play was originally produced on Broadway in the
late 1950's with Carol Burnett as the princess.

The plot deals with the problem of ﬁnding a genuine
princess for Prince Dauntless (Mark Brertempfel): The
girls competing for his hand in marriage must go through
rigorous tests, ordered by his mother, Queen Aggravain

(Caryn Ronis), and her right hand man, the Wizard (Robert
Walker). In the meantime, no one else in the kingdom can
marry before the prince. . \

Enter Princess Winifred (Casey Brown), dripping wet

from ' her recent swim in the moat. The prince falls
hopelessly in love and vows to help Winifred pass the royal
test. After much consternation over the test’s subject, the
queen decides on sensitivity.
‘ She proclaims that a real princess could feel a pea under
20 mattresses. Secretly, the queen sends her wizard to mix
a sleeping potion while she gets the smallest pea to be
placed under the 20 downy mattresses.

Various subplots include Lady Larken (Barb Matson) and
Sir Harry’s (Geoffrey Thompson) determination to be
married within nine months and the real reason for the

ENTERTAINMENT

King's Court Plans Special Events  

By FORREST BUFFENMYER

Pitt News Staff Writer
‘ It gives you kind of a good

a feeling to know that a merchant

cares, not just about people's

money, but about people.
Herman Hartman, manager of

the King’s Court Theater in

‘Oakland, is such a person. He is

attempting to relate to the
surrounding college crowd by
running his theater in a way geared
to people, not necessarily proﬁt.

Hartman, manager of the King’s
Court since March of 1978, believes
that a movie should be fun to go to.

The theater’s gothic castle-like
appearance is unusual and draws
attention to itself but the inner
lobby’s walls are contemporary,
decorated with Roger Dean art-
work, Steelers news clippings, and
various rock group posters.

“I try to make this theater
different from others, someplace
people will remember when they
leave,” Hartman said.

In addition to making the theater
look different, Hartman does
things to promote his ﬁlms that are
a bit different. Actually quite a bit.
If you walk past the theater some
weekend late at night and see
transvestites or superheroes in-
side, don’t be alarmed. This is the
weekend midnight showing of
“(Rocky Horror Picture Show.” A
costume judging is just one of the
things Hartman does to make going
to the movies fun.

“I try to make every week
something special,” Hartman said.

Anyone who wears a costume
gets in free, and the winner usually
receives a free “Rocky Horror”
soundtrack LP and passes for the
normal evening feature. Hartman
stressed that a personal interpreta-
tion for a costume is very possible.

Upcoming promotions will in-
clude Super Heroes Night on Jan.
26-27, and a Movie Star contest on

‘You Had’ To Be There’

Feb. 2-3, where patrons may dress
as their favorite movie stars.
“Valentine’s Night,” where Cupid-
like attire will be the norm will be
Feb. 9-10, and “Coneheads Night”
or “Saturday Night Live” night,
where participants are to dress as
Coneheads or their favorite ‘ ‘Satur-
day—Night Live” characters will be
Feb. 16-17.

“Watership Down,” the movie
based on Richard Shardik’s best-
selling novel will open on Feb. 2,
replacing the current “Lord of the
Rings” as the evening feature. On
that evening, the staff (not the
customers) will be dressed as
rabbits, and ﬁlmgoers will have to
cross a grassy lobby and go
through a rabbit-hole to enter the
theater. Inside will be a bar with ‘a
rabbit bartender, who will serve
carrot juice. -

The rock group “Rygel” will
perform on Valentine’s Day before
the ﬁlm’s showing..

7 Buffett Live ——— Just Like Being There

By HARRISON C. STACKPOLE

Pitt News Staff Writer
You Had To Be There
Jimmy Buffett

L ABC Records

When the words country and
western are associated with music,
most people automatically assume
that the perfoi-mer is either a

I cowboy (in the tradition of Roy

Rogers, Tex Ritter, and the like) or
some sort of Ozark Mountain

hillbilly who manages to come to
Nashville to play his soulful tunes
about -nature and lost loves.

If you are one of those people,
shame on you. There is an element
of country music that involves
another realm or image other than
the stereotypes mentioned above:
the sailor. It's been a long time
since the men of the sea sang the
dreary, “Yo Ho Ho and a bottle of
rum.” Good riddance to them.

Today’s sailor sings country
music, and probably the biggest
name in the sailor-singer business
right now is Jimmy Buffett.

For about 15 years, Buffett was
roaming from coast to coast
gathering a small following who
learned to enjoy his special style of
combining enthusiasm and the sea
under a country music melody.
When Buffett ﬁnally reached the

big time with his _hit album
“Changes in Attitudes, Changes in
Latitudes” (which included his
biggest success, “Margarita-
ville”), sailors all over the country
ﬁnally had somebody who sang
their songs.

This latest Buffett release,‘

“‘You Had To Be There” is a very
special album for two reasons. It is

_a live album (more importantly, it

is a very good live album, similar in

album is a collection of Buffett’s
greatest hits.

~ The two album set has them all,
from “Margaritaville” to “Son Of

only Buffett can supply, Buffett’s
rapport with the crowd combined
with his music is, to say the least,
quite an experience.

Fabulours Fox in Atlanta.and the

crew, the Coral Reefer Band,
consists of Kenneth Buttrey on
drums, Deborah McColl on back-up
vocals, Harry Dailey and Barry

Mike Utley on keyboards and Greg

All are ﬁne musicians and a
deﬁnite credit to the Buffett style.

The best way to sum it all up is
by saying that the best part of

Wrestlers Wary as They Travel To Columbus

.. By JIM LEWIS

Pitt News Staff Writer

COLUMBUS, O.-——After a promising
24-17 loss to eighth-ranked Lehigh, the
Pitt wrestling team travels to Columbus
for a triangular meet with Ohio State and
Notre Dame Sunday at 1 p.m.

The Panthers, who came back from an
18-0 deﬁcit to challenge the heralded
Engineers at one point, 18-14, face two
potential Top_Twenty teams while trying
to up their record from 3-3.

“We’re not going to let down against
them,” Pitt head coach Dave Adams said.

“It’ll be a hard time going against both
teams in the same day.”

The Buckeyes, winners of the Ohio
Tournament over 18th-ranked Cleveland
State this week, are coming off a 22-18
upset of 12th-ranked Clarion, and have
suddenly emerged as one of the best
teams in the nation, thanks to the

resurrection job head coach Chris Ford 

did to their program.

“They got him three years ago,”
Adams explained, “and Ohio State has
been improving ever since. This year,
they said they had some recruits that
really are outstanding.”

This season, the Buckeyes hope to

challenge third-ranked Wisconsin, ninth-
ranked Minnesota, 14th-ranked Michigan
State, and 16th-ranked Michigan for the
Big Ten Conference crown.

Notre Dame, led by football All-Ameri-
ca Bob Golic—the Irish heavyweight
wrestler—climbed to an 18th-ranked spot
in the ﬁnal standings last year. Golic
returns this season, leading the Irish to a
pre-season 18th national ranking.

“Notre Dame has had respectable
teams right along these past years,”
Adams said. “It’s not like Notre Dame’s
football team, of course—but respect-
able.”

Pitt is still eliminating at different
weights, as injuries to 142-pounder Steve
Gouletas (back problems) and 150-pound-
er Ed Bredniak (torn tendons in his right
thumb) have put the two Panthers out of
the lineup. Otherwise, the starting 10 will
be the same that challenged Lehigh:
Glenn Maxwell (118 pounds), 4-2-2; Jose
Martinez (126), 6-4-1; Glen Nacion (134),
0-3; Steve Carter (142), 1-2, or Kim

Smith, 0-0; Mario Mancini (150), 0-0, or

Carter or Smith; Tom Jones (158), 10-2;
Skip Bolin (167), 3-0-2; Jim Gordon (177),
8-3; Pat Connor (190), 5-7, or‘ John
Chendy, 0-0; and Steve Smocharski
(heavyweight).

Swimmers
Tuning For
Terrapins

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

When meeting George Washing-
ton and Maryland this weekend,
Pitt’s swimmers (4-0) will see
dissimilar opponents.

George Washington probably
has one of the weakest teams in the
east (its swim program is only ﬁve
years old) and should be no match
for the Panthers. 9 , 

On the other hand, Maryland
(4-2) is one of the east’s top teams

— and is expected to contend with Pitt
for the area’s top honors.

Consequently, Pitt has been
paying little attention to George
Washington and instead has been
concentrating on Maryland’s Ter-
rapins.

“We really aren't worried about
Friday’s meet,” Pitt coach Fred
Lewis conceded. “George Wash-
ington has-an extremely new team
and doesn’t have much depth.
They’re deﬁnitely in a building
stage.” ‘

Maryland, however, is a dif-
ferent story. The Terrapins, ac-
cording to Lewis, will be extremely

difﬁcult to defeat at their home. A

Pitt has not won at College Park in
the past 20 years. V

Maryland, in fact, was the last
team to defeat Pitt (in 1977). The
Panthers are undefeated in their
last 14 dual meets. A

“lt’s going to be tough,” Lewis
said. “From what I understand,
Maryland’s going to be tapered
and rested. We’re expecting some
extremely good performances. Our
kids better be up for this meet.”

Making things more difficult,
according to Lewis, is the fact the
Terrapins lost their last two meets
and are “anxious to rebound.”

“They want to win,” the Panther

, coach said. “They don’t want a
losing season.”

Maryland lost to North Carolina
State and North Carolina, two,,.of
the toughest teams in the Atlantic
Coast Conference.

Pitt, meanwhile, defeated North
Carolina last December.

Maryland is strong in every
event except the 200-yard breast-
stroke and backstroke, Lewis said.

“We’re pretty much assured of a
win in those events,” the Pitt coach
added. “Otherwise. the meet is
going to be awfully close.”

Swimming for the Panthers in
the 200-yard breaststroke will be
Eastern leaders Bob Clemmer,
Mike Connor, and Orlando Catin-
chi. Another Panther—freshman
Sandy Pidgeon—isp ranked fourth in
the East, but will not compete
because only three individuals from
each team can be used in an event.

Sammie Ellis" had little trouble scoring Inside against Mercyhurst last

night.

Cagers

Survive

Scare, 91-85

By MARIA SCIULLO
Pitt News Asst. Sports Editor

For a while last night, it was
uncomfortably evident that the Pitt
basketball team might in fact lose
to Mercyhurst College, a scrappy
bunch of little guys who comprised
perhaps the best of the small
college squads the Panthers will
have faced all year. And at the
time, that possibility turned reality
would have seemed to be just about
the worst thing that could happen
to Tim Grgurich’s cagers until...

With 4:10 remaining in the game
and Pitt up by seven points, center
Sam Clancy drove into the key for a

layup and upon scoring, was sent

crashing to the floor. Clancy,
thought by many to be practically
indestructible, grimaced as he lay
ﬂat on his back, and clutched his
left leg. Suddenly, the possibility
of playing any of the next-three
games (all Eastern Eight match-
ups) without the services of the
Panther’s inside mainstay took
precedence in the minds of the
1700 or so spectators. A

But once again Clancy arose
unscathed, and after a brief rest
returned to the game, thus putting
both fears to rest as the Panthers
pulled out a 91-85 win over the
visiting Lakers. ,

“If that had been anyone else.”
said assistant coach Cleve Edwards
after the game, “he would have
been out.”

Along with Sammie‘ Ellis’ 24 6

points and 13 rebounds, Clancy's
contribution of 22 points and 19

4-1 Swimmers Hope ToRise

By LINDA VENZON
Pitt News Staff Writer
The last thing most students
would welcome at 6 a.m. is a dip at
Trees Pool. But for members of the
4-1 Pantherette swim team, that

early dip. is each morning’s first ,

appointment.

A pair of reasons for such
pre-dawn punishment comes this
weekend, when coach Dick Brad-
shaw’s swimmers meet George

Washington tonight and Maryland”

tomorrow afternoon.

Pitt not only will be attempting to
defeat two opponents this week-
end; Bradshaw also is concerned
with the number of swimmers his
team will send to March's Eastern
regional championships.

“Our goal is to qualify for 26
more spots in the Easterns this
weekend,” Bradshaw said. “We
need them to be in a strong position
at the Easterns.”

One way in which Pitt seeks to
prepare for post-season competi-
tion is the amount of work the
Pantherettes are asked to do.
Bradshaw plans to ask less of time
in the future.

“The team is mentally and
physically run down now,” Brad-
shaw said. “But good athletes ﬁnd
something to keep them going.”

All-American swimmer Kathy
Stetler, Bradshaw's best per-
former, says she is naturally
motivated when competing but

uses special techniques to make the
most of practice.

“I use something of a displace-
ment theory,” Stetler said. “If
something is on my mind, I try to
concentrate on other things that
will help me more in the long run.”

Balfhaser Not Upset
Despite Loss To Maryland

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staffwriter

The Pantherette basketball team
fought fifth-ranked Maryland
nearly to a draw before the
Terrapins took advantage of Pitt
problems Wednesday night during
the last minutes of their 81-74 win.
/ “We came so close to upsetting
Maryland,” Pitt coach Jean Baltha-
ser said. “We had them right

. where we wanted them but we just

didn’t have that killer punch to win
the game.”

Turnovers, fouls and an injury to
guard Peggy Dugan plagued Pitt
during the second half, and
Dugan’s injury--it was the fourth

suffered by a Pitt guard this
season——could hurt Pitt more than
it did Wednesday evening.

Two Pantherettes—Gail Augh-
burns and Stephanie Stripling—
fouled out late in the contest.

“The loss of Peg, Gail and
Stephanie hurt us very much,"
Balthaser said. “We were only two
points down when Gail and
Stephanie fouled out.”

Wanda Randolph led Pitt scor-
ers, with 25 points, and captain
Robin Fry added 18.

Pitt will entertain Penn State’s
nationally ranked Lady Lions
tomorrow at 5:45 ‘pm.

caroms were enough to almost
literally lift the now 8-8 Pitt squad
above a well-coached Mercyhurst
lineup.

From the start, the Laker
starting five (which averaged
slightly over six feet in height)

proved that they did not travel

more than four hours over
treacherous roads from Erie only to
put up a decent fight against the
big-city guys and then go on home.
Instead, 5-8 guard Sherrard Ben-
nard snagged the opening tipoff
and raced to the Laker basket” for a
quick two points. Bennard, who if
not for his ﬂashy blue and green
Mercyhurst uniform, could have-
been mistaken for some local junior

high kid who just happened. to.

wander onto the court, sparked his
team with 19 points and eight
assists, while 5-10 teammate Dan
Brown and forward Bill Link each
contributed 15 points.

The Lakers went as far as to look

intimidating. On two occasions 6-1 ‘

guard/ center/ forward Bruce Hen-
nings forcefully alley-ooped in
shots that woke up the usually
lackadaisical Fieldhouse crowd.
Pitt came back with such a play of
its own later in the game, a Pete
Strickland to Clancy number.

Both teams shot well during the
ﬁrst half. Mercyhurst’s 59 percent
allowed the Lakers to pull even
with Pitt at the halftime buzzer,
47-all, even though the Panthers
made almost 56 percent of their
shots. But then the home team
took advantage of an offensive cold
spell by the Lakers to run off nine
straight points after ﬁve minutes
had elapsed in the second ‘half.
Although Mercyhurst pulled within
six points with less than two
minutes to play, the game was
never really in question after Pitt
maintained that margin by showing
it could break the quicker Mercy-
hurst team's press.

Laker coach Dan O’Connor
explained that his squad knew it
had to do the. obvious and pressure
the taller Panthers if there was to
be any chance of an upset.

“We knew Pitt had good talent
and that we couldn’t possibly
match them on the boards, so we
tried to be quicker, O’Connor
said. “I think our kids did a great
job. We have the guards, now all
we need is the height.”

Fortunately for Pitt, the Panthers
didn’t lose six feet, six inches of
theirs last night. ’

PITT NOTES—The Panthers
boosted their rebounding ﬁgures
by pulling down 55, while
Mercyhurst collected 22...Carlton
Neverson contributed 12 points and
eight rebounds, while Wayne
Williams posted the same amount
in the scoring column, but had
three rebounds.

G mnasfs Meet
ichigan State I

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer
Pitt’s women’s gymnasts,

ranked 15th nationally, will meet
11th-ranked Michigan State Sun-
day afternoon at Trees Hall.

Michigan State is undefeated
after three meets, while Pitt (2-1)
suffered its lone loss two weeks ago
against defending national cham-
pion Penn State.

“It’s going to be a really, really
close meet,” said Pitt coach Donna
DeMarino Sanft. “Michigan State
has an excellent team. In some
ways, they’ll probably be tougher
for our girls than Penn State was.

“Every 10th of a point will
count,” Sanft continued. “There's

_ alot of pressure when you’re in a

situation like that.” I
The Pantherettes, according to

A Sanft, will need to score at least 132

points if they are to win. They have
yet to score that many points this
season. Their highest point total
was 130.15 against West Virginia
several weeks ago. _

Sanft added that her team could

be able to score at least 135 points a

A, meet. But injuries have prevented

the Pantherettes from achieving
that goal.

Hurt are three of Pitt’s top
performers. Myra Bachuchin, Ali-
son Hoburg, and Roxanne Evans
all have seen limited action

V because of foot or leg injuries.

Evans probably will miss Sun-

day's meet because of an ankle,

sprain. The freshman from Read-
ing was the third-leading scorer in
Pitt’s win against Maryland Tues-
day.
Because of the injury situation,
Pitt will rely on specialists Dawn
,Reimer (all-around competition),
Karen Zandi, Diane Debich, and
Cindy Solyan (vaulting, balance
beam and ﬂoor exercise) to pick up

p the (scoring slack.

Debich and Solyan collected

I career-high scores against Mary-

land and are expected to improve.

Sunday’s meet begins at 1 p.m.
though the schedule says it starts
at 2:00. '

made January 11, 1979. The proposals concerned if either or both of two cons-
titution issues were to be placed on this week's elections ballot. The first proposal,
a complete new Student Government Constitution, will appear on the ballot.
The second, an amendment involving the allocations process, may be sent before

5.)

Terrance Milani's recommendations to alter the PUPC contract wm reviewed for
the second time by the SGB. Two students attended the meeting, representing
the Lecture Committee and the Recreation Committee, to express their support
for the contract. The SGB approved the list of six alterations. Mr. Milmi feels that
these changes will allow more students to effectively participate in PUPC de-

6.
Mike Seitz, representing the Allocations Committee. presented the second recom-

mendation for Elections Committee funding. Last week, the SGB had rejected

certain items concerning salaries and printing of ﬂyers. The second A. Com.

\.a

recommendation allowed for full funding for pollworker and overseer salaries and
no funding for flyers. The SGB accepted this recommendation. Further Alloca-
tions business included the passage of a new Policies and Procedures for the
committee to follow.

Board member, Bernie Popco reported on. the Energy Advisory Committee
meeting. The utility company has effected a retroactive rate hike causing the
University a compounded cost of approximately $250,000 plus the effective rate
hike from this day forward. The Committee is now reviewing ways in which to cut
electric consumption such as. enforcing the building entrance hours, however, no
decisions have been reached to date.

A student from the Young Socialist Alliance attended Friday's meeting seeking
Board support for Hector Marroquin, a Mexican Socialist activist who is thus far
making an unsuccessful plea for political asylum in the U.S. The Y.S.A. also re-
quested the Board to co-sponsor a meeting Thursday. January 25, 1979 to inform
students of Hector Marroquin’s positions. The SGB voted to co-sponsor the
meeting, but to delay consideration of support until further understanding of the
cause is reached.

The next Student_ Government Board meeting will be held Friday, January 26,
1 979 at 3:1 5 in room 305 S.U. Meetings are open to all students. Further infor-
mation concerning the January 19th meeting may be obtained in 305 S.U. during
regular office hours.

Attention all student organizations wishing to apply for funding in fiscal
year 1979-80. The Allocations Committee is holding its annual
Business Managers meeting Monday, Jan. 29, 1979 at 7:30 p.m. in
