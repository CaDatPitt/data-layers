  Posvar Says Student Union’s Name May Not Change

streets) on which they are located,

By BRIAN BALK

Schenley Hall may not be tagged
the “Pitt Union” after all, according
to Chancellor Wesley, Posvar. The
new name was only a' “suggestion”
brought up at a staff meeting.

“No decision has been made as of
yet," Posvar said.

The name “Pitt Union” was pro-
posed to change the second-hand
hotel connotation of Schenley Hall

» and to aid Pitt’s “university image"
‘ ‘as a whole.

“It will be a union,” Posvar said.
‘‘It will not be a hall in the sense of an
academic building or dormitory.”

Posvar said the university wants
to promote the excitement and
modernity the new facilities will pro-
vide. Schenley Hall has been under-
going an extensive renovation at a
cost of $12 million—-—six times more
than what Pitt originally paid for the
building. A

“We want to change the image of a

C second-hand, run-down hotel that

Pitt bought and has renovated at an

'<Q.extensive cost,” he said.

If the name Pitt Union is
approved, it may only be a tempo-
rary title. . .

“We want to keep the name fairly
ﬂexible," Bernard Kobosky, vice

chancellor of public affairs, said. «-

I ,«l

Pitt is hoping to arouse enough
interest in the new student union so
that a major contributor, such as an
industry or foundation, will donate
funds for the upkeep and maintain-
ence of the building. The renovated
student union would then be named
after the contributor.

Many students have voiced their
displeasure at the proposed name
change. The campus radio station
WPGH as well as the Resident Stu-
dent Association (RSA), have both
been circulating petitions protesting
the renaming.

“The name ‘Schenley’ has
no historical connection to
the university. ”

A large part of the disgruntlcment
stems from a belief that the student
union will lose all of its historical
significance once it is dubbed with
the new name. Posvar, however,
thinks differently.

“The name ‘Schenley' has no his-
torical connection to the university
at all,” Posvar said.

He exlained that the name “Pitt
Union,” derived from William Pitt,

\\\the founder of the city of Pittsburgh,

holds more historical significance to
the university. '
Posvar also added that the Hotel



Administration Enrages SGB  

By CHRISTINA CLINTON

The Student Government Board
is enraged that the university admin-
istration went over its head and re-
appointed a student as a
representative on the Board of Trus-
tees without contacting the board,
and it plans to take strong actions if
the situation is not rectified.

The board will be sending a letter
to Chancellor Wesley Posvar this
morning saying it feels “slighted and
abandoned" because the administra-
tion did not consult with any student
leaders before reappointing Tom
Hajduk of CGS to another term.

The whole problem started in
November, 1982, when former
board president Todd DeLuca
wrote a letter to Gov. Richard
Thornburgh stating that SGB was in
the process of putting together a
nominating’ process to put a student
on the Board of Trustees. It is prac-
tice for one of the four common-
wealth representatives on the board
to be a student. _

DeLuca received no respons
from the governor’s office. Instead,
Thornburgh wrote a letter to the
university administration in
December, 1982, saying he needed a
recommendation. Dr. John R. Qua-
troche, the secretary of the univer-
sity, submitted Hajduk’s name for

' reappointment without consulting

any of the three student government
‘bodies——SGB, the College of Gen-

Schenley was never officially

‘named-—its name was taken from
the owners of the farm on which the ‘

hotel was built.
According to Posvar, the Board
of Trustees approves all the new

- eral Studies Student Cabinet and the

Graduate and Professional Student
Association. i

Newly-inaugurated president
Mark Downs wrote a letter to Pos-
var, Thornburgh and other govern-
mental officials on Feb. 14 saying
the board was getting ready to start
the search.

Downs then approached Qua-
troche with the situation later in the
month only to find that Hajduk had
been reappointed. When asked why
DeLuca was not informed, Qua-
troche said, “It was a loophole that
Todd was not contacted and that
there was not student input in the
process,” Downs said.

Quatroche told Downs during a
student affairs luncheon on Feb. 17
that he was following normal nomi-
nating procedures and Downs was
misinformed about the procedures.

Downs received Act 306, which
outlines the nominating procedures,
from state legislator Frank Pistella.
The procedures, however, apply to
state colleges and universitites. Pitt
is a state-related university.

Downs then wrote a letterto Qua-
troche after that meeting and said he
was “appalled to find that the uni-
versity has taken this unilateral
action without the consent or even
the knowledge of the student consti-
tuency which this student member of
the Board of Trustees is to
represent."

He also demanded that Hajduk’s

names for buildings. In the past,
buildings have been named for a
practical scheme and for historical
significance. The Victoria Building,
Forbes Quadrangle and Thackeray
Hall were all named for the area (or

nomination be withdrawn
immediately.
Senior Vice-Chancellor for

'Finance and Administration Jack
‘ Freeman contacted Downs and told

him there was misinformation about
the procedures and iiivited Downs,
DeLuca and board member Kathy
Brown to discuss the policies.
“More or less, what Dr. Freeman
expressed to uswas that, yes, some-
one had made a mistake by not con-
tacting students, but that any public
action on our part would jeopardize
the credibility of student govern-
ment, would cause severe political
implications for the university and
would embarrass the university
administration,” Downs said.
Freeman then suggested that
Downs and Brown talk things over

with Hajduk and submit a proposal ‘

to Posvar that would initiate a
search committee for student repre-

sentatives the next time a position 

opened.

The board discussed the options
available to them and decided to
write documents that would outline
the duties and responsibilities of the
student representative and “pursue
the matter on a professional level.”

Downs and board member Jeff
Schaffer then set up a March l8

~meeting with Quatroche to discuss

the board's decision. They had to
cancel that meeting but rescheduled
it for March 23.

Brackenridge Hall, Litchfield Tow-

were all named after prominent indi-
viduals who contributed to Pitt in
some manner.

By KAREN TRAEGER

Pitt’s lnterfraternity Council
(IFC) says the, days of wild
rushes are over, after the council
passed a proposal in favor of a
new dry open rush policy.

IFC President Greg Wilson

-said that starting next fall there
will be I0 days of open rush with-
out any type of alcohol followed
by 10 days of closed rush, short--
ening the annual recruiting scene
by a week. .

I The new policy also states that
there will be no rushee in the
houses during brotherhood
events.

“It's a relatively new idea to
us," Wilson said. “Something we
have just introduced in the last
two months, and we have done a

IFC Passes Dry Rush Policy.

The idea for the proposal was
the result of an IFC retreat,
round table discussions, that
were held at the Mariott in Mon-
roeville last January,

In the old rush schedule, the
first two weeks were open and

alcoholic beverages were gener- A

ally served, followed by a two
week closed period where
pledges attended fraternity par-
ties by invitation only.

Along with the shortened and .
partially dry rush, the new ruling
may require fraternities to sub-
mit a list of the pledges invited to
the closed parties. Limiting the
number of parties is another
foreseeable possibility.

“Smaller parties will induce
better rushing because brothers
can concentrate their efforts

more on a one to one basis rather
than be distracted with the party
and beer,” Wilson said.

Wilson sighted several pros
and cons associated with this
new proposal which he will be
spending all summer working on

to ensure its success.

A Partial dry rush will save the
fraternities the expense ‘on alco-
hol and reduces the risk of
liabilities.

If a minor at a party gets into
an accident after drinking, the
fraternity, the person giving him
the drink and the university
would all be liable. Depending
on the suit, the national heiid-
quarters of that fraternity could
also be liable, -Wilson explained.

No_alcohol would generate a

lot of ‘investigation?’

By PEGGY FERRI

Since President Reagan’s recent
speech in which he suggested more
satellite weaponry research, atten-
tion has been focused on the feasi-
bility, necessity and utility of.
space-age military technology.

This week’s Forum focuses on
these aspects and how they might
affect the nation's future.

Dr. Wilfried ‘Daehnick, a Pitt‘

physics professor, stressed he could

‘ not speak as an expert but said he

viewed enthusiasm for such space-
age research with great concern.

“Research on particle beam las-
ers [for example] is possible in.prin-
ciple, but the money involved would
be astronomical,” Daehnick said.
“And even if effective weapons
could be developed——it would be at
least a decade.” He added his per-
’sonal enthusiasm for such weapon-
ry is not high;

“Scientists are always concerned
with the use of scientific knowledge
for war,” he said. “They speak out
all the time.”

Board

By PAUL CORREA

The Student Government Board
(SGB) passed four budgets and
rejected three during yesterday's
meeting. All budgets heard yester-
day had been previously rejected by
the SGB.

The Resident Student Associa-
tion’s (RSA) budget request for
numerous Pitt News ads and funds-
to send l0 people to two national
conferences was again rejected. The
Committee recom-
mended, as before, that the requests
for the ads and the trips be rejected.

“I think we were quite Tair in giv-
ing ads,” Allocations chairperson
James Shelton said. “I still think
they should look into alternative
means of advertising.”

Regarding the conferences, Shel-
ton said the board has an unwritten
policy that states a maximum of four
people can be sent.

An RSA spokesman who had
been in contact with Penn State, the
site of this year’s national RSA con-
ference, said dther schools send
between l0-l5 people to the
conference.

Board member Jeff Schaffer said
that there is no written policy that
states a maximum of four people can
be sent. According to Schaffer, Allo-
cations had been operating on a
“gentleman’s agreement“ when they
referred to the policy.

Board member Mindy Goldberg

  Forum:     
.,,Should (LS. Conduct Space Weapons Research?

The use of science, however, is a
decision that is ultimately in the
hands of those elected, accoding to
Daehnick. As a result, he said, it is a
citizen's responsibility to see that
this knowledge is not abused.

He added, however, that many
scientists will work for defense pur-
poses provided they are assured of
the weapon’s ethical operation.

“Ever since World War II, abuses

W of [scientiﬁc] knowledge have raised

many concerned voices in the scien-
tific community,” Daehnick said.

Scientists, he added, are no differ- ’

ent from any other loyal citizens.
When elected government offi-
cials are found not to be trust-
worthy, the recourse is to work to
elect someone else, but scientists
are at a slight disadvantage, accord-
ing to Daehnick. ‘
“Scientists are not very good
salesmen,” he explained‘, “and this is
a problem _with the profession.” He
reasoned that this exists because
scientists are hesitant to make clear-
cut decisions because they usually
see both sides of every issue

Rehears

said, “RSA is showing a desire to
work harder for the~students-—they
should be afforded the opportunity

‘ to do so.” She added that four peo-

ple were not enough to send to the

-» conference.

’ ‘The SGB rejected the RSA budget
by a voteof 7-1. Since the budget
was rejected a second time, the SGB
has two weeks to restructure it. If,

within the two weeks, the SGB has “

not restructured it, the budget will
pass as it stands.

The Engineering Student Cabinet;

(ESC) also had its budget rejected a
second time. ESC requested a
Senior Recognition Nightand the
Allocations Committee recom-
mended that it not be funded.

Shelton said the program is basi-
cally a duplication of the graduation
ceremonies at the Civic Arena.

An ESC spokesman said that it
was not a duplication of programs
but an opportunity to recognize gra-
duating seniors for four years of
hard .work.

The SGB voted 7-l to reject the
budget. The SGB has two weeks to
restructure this budget as well.

The third budget rejected by the
SGB was the Pitt Men's Glee Club.
The Glee Club had originally asked
for two retreats by which to practice
for performances. The Allocations
Committee originally had recom-
mended that only one be funded.
This week, the Allocations Commit-
tee recommended that neither

clearly.”

He urged people‘ to take a hard
look at the new weapons proposed
by Reagan.

“They should look at the implica-
tions and what they would do to the
future of peace or the escalation of
war,” he said. “I am pessimistic.”

Pitt history professor Dr Robert
Colodny is more than pessimistic-
he said he is appalled.

He said he views it as “an
immense diversion of scientific tal-
ent into a meaningless activity.”

“lt is part of [man’s] yearning for
the ultimate weapon of defense that
goes back as far as history,”
Colodny explained.

Referring to . Reagan’s recent
proposals, Colodny called them
part of Reagan’s comic-book men-
tality of ..watching too much Buck
Rodgers as a boy. V

“lt appalls me to see this shrinking
pool of talent, which is badly needed
for social projects, be diverted into
this grotesque nonsense,” Colodny
said. -“University talent will also be
diverted into this research—it will

be f_und_ed.”

Lt. Colonel Joseph R. Kolek, Pitt
professor. of aerospace studies,
stressed that he cannot comment
on the weapons’ feasibility but said
that research is needed to see if it is
feasible.

“The bottom line is that if we [in
the Air Force] are in the business of
defending the country, then we
should defend the country,” Kolek
explained. -

Pointing to several publications
and recent speeches, Kolek said
estimates indicate the Soviets have
taken the lead in high-energy laser
programs. He added that he agrees
with a speech given before the

Senate Foreign Relations Sub-_

Committee on Arms Control by
Undersecretary of Defense Dr.
Richard DeLauer in which he stated
his reasons for continued research.
Primarily, that “the Defense Depart-
ment conducts research and plan-
ning efforts to support those
national security interests of the
U.S. by developing those military
capabilities required to respond to

If--Page3’ W V 

threats to the national security.”

Further, the speech states that 5

given the alarming rate of Soviet
spending for space activities, it
would be imprudent for the U.S. not
to be prepared to defend its
interests.

Although this is peacetime, Kolek

urged thatthe U.S. pursue such ' if 

research to ensure stability.

“Oil companies drill a lot and get
dry holes,” Kolek explained, “and
they keep drilling because they

aren’t sure what they're going to. -

find.

“We can’t just wait around for-

something to happen,” he said. “I
don’t see anything wrong with it
[research] or trying.”

He further agreed with other
speeches which stress the impor-
tance of constant awareness as the

best technical course for the U.S. .

military space systems by which to
maintain pre-eminence.

retreat be funded.

“The retreats are simply practice
sessions which can be done on cam-
pus,” Shelton said. “Based on this
information, we recommend not
funding any of the retreats."

’ A Glee Club spokesman said that
the facilities on campus are not very
good. He said a retreat is necessary,
especially in a commuter school like
Pitt". The spokesman said, “We need
the time to practice in order to put
on a quality performance."

The board voted 5-2 with one
abstention to reject the Glee Club’s

budget.

Quo Vadis requested $2,058 for a
“Toronto, Canada Excursion. inc
Allocations Committee recom-
mended that it not be funded.

A Quo Vadis spokesman said
Toronto is an international city with‘
both ethnic and cultural attractions
and the club wants to bring some of
the city's international flavor back
to Pitt.

She added that Pitt’s Nationality
Room tour guides act as ambassa-
dors to the rest of the world and such
a trip would help them improve the
tours they give.

The board voted to accept the
Quo Vadis budget unanimously.

.They received $785 out of the $3,019

requested.

Society, Masada, Legal Awareness
Committee and the Student Rela-
tions Committee were passed

more positive fraternity image
among the community and the
university. Neighborhood prob-
lems, including traffic, drunken
vandals and noise, would all
decrease.

“No longer will alcohol, asso-
ciated with that first week, be the
central activity," Wilson said.
“That first week will now be a
time to introduce the fraternity
and for meeting the brothers.“

Barry Greene, a member of the
executive IFC board, agrees’that
this measure will increase coop-
eration from the university
administration, which in the past
has often complained about
alcohol related incidences.

But losing the party atmos-
phere may not attract the fresh-
men to rush Wilson says, since
the absence of alcohol will take
away from the social aspect.

“Beer tends to break down the
pledges inhibitions and makes
them more comfortable," he
said. “Now, in order to introduce
ourselves we're going to have to

reeducate ourselves to coming up
with new aggressive programs in
our rush." P

Fraternities who do not
comply with the ruling could be
assessed a $100 to $300 fine and
will be barred from intramural
sports for one term. A second
offense could result with a $500
to $700 fine. In both cases deci-
sions are made by the executive
board.

“lt‘s inexcusable for a fratern-
ity to want to sneak around this,”
Greene said, “because it is such a
positive goal we're striving for."

The only problem Wilson
anticipates will be with people
who do not understand the pol-
icy. Other than that, both Wilson
and Greene expect everyone to
comply.

To ensure that the fraternity
adheres to the new policy, Wil-
son wants to create the vice presi-
dent patrol.

“We would like each house to
be represented in the new moni-
toring system by using the vice
president from each of the

Dry Rushed Policy Passed

houses."

Although still in the rough
stage, ﬁve regions have been
categorized for the patrol. On
any given‘ night, each region will

' be policed by two people from
the patrol during rush, making
spot checks and monitoring the
parties. ‘

During open rush the primary
concern will be to make sure
alcohol is absent from the par-
ties. Loitering, garbage and noise
level will be the emphasis during
closed rush.

In addition, the patrol will also
check guest ‘registers to ensure
that the number of people inside
the house does not exceed fire
law limits.

In the past, policing was done
on a small scale by the five execu-

Board Angered

continued from page one

During the course of that meeting,
Schaffer said they felt good about
the process because Quatroche told

, them he saw no problem with the

two proposals the board drew up.
He said he had to go through the
proper administrative channels to
finalize.

Yesterday Downs and Schaffer
contacted Pistella in Harrisburg to
thank him for his help and found
that Pistella had a copy of a letter
that Quatroche wrote to Robert
Wilburn, the secretary of education,
on March l8 reaffirming Hajduk’s
appointment. ‘

Quatroche’s letter said the invol-
vement of the SGB was an “unfortu-
nate misunderstanding on the part
of student leaders" and was a “result
of their lack of familiarity with the
trustee reappointment process.”

The letter further stated that the
student government bodies were
“personally briefed” on the reap-
pointment procedures and. that
“Downs does not intend to pursue
this matter further and that the Stu-
dent Government Board has agreed
to work with Mr. Hajduk to ensure
his understanding of the interests of
all our students.”

.The letter, however, was dated
five days before the actual meeting
between Quatroche, Downs and
Schaffer took place.

Downs and Schaffer found out
about the letter by coincidence and
are upset because it was written

behind their backs.
“This letter is not in good bargain-
ing faith,” Downs said.

“The letter is completely false,” V

Brown said. .
Both Downs and Brown called the
whole process a “cover-up” because

the university made such ‘a big deal ~

about the Tncident when they told
SGB it was not.

The board is now demanding the
resignation of Hajduk and the
acknowledgement and acceptance
of its proposal for a search commit-
tee to ﬁnd a student representative
of the Board of Trustees.

Brown said if the demands are not
met by Friday, April 8, the board
will:

0 Send brief letters to the
members of the state house and
senate notifying them of the
situation; -

0 Write a letter to The Chronicle
of Higher Education expressing the
board's concern; 8

0 Call a press conference with the
major media in the city outlining the
incident;

_ 0 Send letters to all student groups
and urge them to immediately stag-
nate all programming;

0 And, finally, withdraw all stu-
dent representatives from all univer-
sity committees, councils and
governing bodies.

The board is unsure about the
response it will receive from the
administration but said it feels sligh-
ted, hurt and deserving of better
treatment.

Opinion

  Liberty  
Or Security? 

About two centuries ago, a document was published
that set out a surprisingly durable plan for a govern-
ment. It embodied thethoughts of a number of Ameri-
can and European writers by emphasizing the need to

T restrict the power of government to make people do
things they don’t want to do. ’

One way that power was to be kept in check was by
opening government ‘policy to public scrutiny and
debate. The First Amendment rights of free speech
and a free press were keystones of this plan.

The world has changed a lot since the U.S. Constitu-
tion was written. Most importantly, external threats to
our freedoms--from the Soviet Union and other ,
countries--have become much more dangerous and
have increased the need to keep our defense plans from
our enemies. ‘ G »

Citing this need for secrecy, President Reagan
recently issued a new rule concerning government offi-
cials who deal with “national security information.”
Under the new directive, officials who have access to
sensitive information must sign an agreement never to
say or write anything on matters of national security
without first seeking official clearance.

This is the sort of thing that tempts many newspaper
editors to pull out their standard “free speech defense,”
but in this case, an important point would be missed by
giving in to a knee-jerk reaction.

Some exceptions to First Amendmentrights for
“national security” reasons are justified by the argu-
ment that if Americans don’t give up a small portion of
their freedoms, their enemies will gain dangerous
opportunities to strip them of all liberties. This is why
few people would want the plans for a hydrogen bomb
to be published in The Pitt News.

The argument, however, only works to a certain
point. It would be wrong for the government to ask
Americans to give up significant freedoms when only
small security benefits are expected. Such a “bomb
shelter mentality" would steal American liberties as
surely as would the Russians. In the case of Reagan’s
new secrecy directive, Americans should ask what
gains are expected. What past leaks from former top
government officials have threatened American
security?

Answers to these questions that would support the
president's rule are not apparent. This point having
been made, it’s‘time for editors to bring out those free
speech defenses.

Letters To The Editor

What’s In   A Name?

Dear Editor:

During the present renaissance at
the University of Pittsburgh, it
seems the university administrators
are striving to make many changes
to bolster the look and prestige of
the campus, the system and the
academics.

‘The Hotel Schenley
was the center of
Pittsburgh's finest
establishments and
institutions.’

I personally feel that the majority
of these changes will greatly benefit
the university community as a
whole, although some changes are
totally irrelevant, unnecessary and

‘even damaging. In particular, the

proposed name change of Schenley
Hall to the Pitt Union is one which
fits in the category of unnecessary
and damaging changes. Before writ-
ing this letter, I felt obligated to
learn a little of the history of Schen-
ley Hall in order to substantiate the
credibility of my stand on this issue.

I found two materials which were
of help in the Special Collections
Section of Hillman Library. I would
first like to articulate a brief history
of Schenley Hall, which is all but
gone and forgotten now, except for
the name of the hall itself, of course.

On Jan. 24, l79l, John Penn
deeded 354 acres of what is now

known as Schenley Farms and
Schenley Park to Edward Smith. On
Oct. 6, 1802, Smith sold 170 acres to
General O’Hara, who bequeathed

the same to his daughter Mary

O’Hara, who married William Cro-
gan. He died on Oct. 25, l827, leav-
ing his estate to his daughter, Mary
E. Crogan, who afterward became
the wife of Captain Edward H.
Schenley of the British Army. So the
Schenley dynasty began.

In 1889, Mrs. Schenley gave the
City of Pittsburgh severai hundred
acres of what is now Schenley Park,
the deed for which was delivered to
the city on Oct. 30, .1890. This gift
was the result of the efforts of E.N.

’ Bigelow and Colonel W.A. Herron.

On Oct. 19, 1897, three and one-half
acres of the present site of Schenley
Hall were deeded to the Bellefield
Company. Subsequently, the ele-
gant Hotel Schenley was built and
was renamed Schenley Hall after

acquisition by the University of-

Pittsburgh. . _

The Hotel Schenley was the center
of Pittsburgh’s finest establishments
and institutions. It served the Syria
Mosque, the. Pittsburgh Athletic
Association, Forbes Field, the
Schenley Theatre, Soldiers and Sail-
ors Hall, Carnegie Technical Insti-
tute (now CMU) and last, but by no
means least, the University of
Pittsburgh.

The Hotel Schenley was also a
congregating place for such Pitts-
burgh legends as Andrew Carnegie,
George Westinghouse, H..l. Heinz,
A.W. Mellon, H.C. Frick and Henry
Buhl, just to name a few. All ofthese
outstanding entrepreneurs had a

‘ vested interest in the Hotel Schenley

and all contributed to its national

‘Taking away the

‘name of Schenley

Hall is a slap in the
face to the elegant

A great injustice is done by strip-
ping Schenley Hall of its name; an
injustice to Pitt, its students and the
city of Pittsburgh as a whole. Pitts-
burgh has a proud and modest heri-
tage which, in this day and age, is all
too easily forgotten. Schenley Hall is
one of the few reminders of Pitts-
burgh’s past that continues to live
on; it is something which is very u-
nique to the university and can be
looked on with pride by Pitt stu-
dents, faculty and administrators
alike. .
Taking away the name of Schen-
ley Hall is a slap in the face to the
elegant Pittsburgh that was and a
great injustice to its university.

The Pitt News, Friday April 1. 1983

Taking the Wrong Road To Immortality

Dear Editor:

From the talk around campus and the
numerous articles published in your news-
paper, it appears that the majority of the
students, faculty and admininistration are
not too fond of the proposal to change the

“name of Schenley Hall to Pitt Union (P.U.).

If this change does go through—and I pray it
doesn’t-——it will merely add to the list of
issues railroaded by the Board of Trustees. I
am not sure who has the last say on the
change, but it seems that the initial idea for
the new name was brought forth by our
Chancellor Wesley Posvar. This brings up
some interesting points. i

I cannot think of any valid justifications
for the name change, but I can come up with
endless reasons for keeping Schenley Hall
_,'l1St that—~Schenley Hall. Why, then, would
Posvar want this landmark building's name
changed? If he has any reasons, I urge him to
let them be known if he cares at all about
public opinion. Making a major decision
like this cannot slide by without telling us
why!

The changing of Mervis Hall to Thacke-
ray Hall was not very controversial, but the
changing of a building’s name that was here
before Posvar was even thought of, I feel,
takes a lot of guts. Besides, it shows no
respect for the heritage and tradition that
Schenley Hall carries with it.

For example, what if the president of the
United States decided he wanted to change
the name of the White House? This, of
course, would be a much more difficult task,
for the separation of power here at Pitt (we

all know that)—but it is the same idea of not
destroying heritage and tradition.
for the powers in our federal government is
greater than the separation of power here at
Pitt (we all know that)—but it is the same
idea of not destroying heritage and
tradition.

With the- changing of‘ these buildings’

names, it seems to me that Posvar wants to
be remembered for something for a long
time—‘much like the president of the United

. States likes to appoint Supreme Court justi-
ces and have them credited to his adminis-
tration. However, while the justices will '
eventually resign or die, the new P.U. name
will probably never change again.

But would this move by Posvar be a wise
one? I think not. Our chancellor has more to
lose in the long run by allowing this absurd
name to be initiated. Its abbreviation says it
all—P.U. It stinks. ,

Why, then, does Wes want to engage in
this sacrilegious act? That's right, sacrile-
gious. Everybody talks about how royalty
and presidents have stayed in our Schenley
Hall—Pitt’s very own building. Just because
Posvar has the power to make certain

J

changes on campus doesn’t give him the

right to destroy a heritage that took so many
years to build. I wouldn’t.dream of it, and
cannot see why our chancellor would either.

The timing, however, is perfect. Right at
the end of school when students and teachers
are pressured by with finals and those who
speak out will most likely be gone for the
summer when the final decision is made.
Good politics, Wes. Way to go!

So, if Posvar wants to be remembered, he
should find another way, for this one surely
carries with it more bad than good precedent
for Pitt and all of Pittsburgh. If the name

change goes through, someone had better ,

come up with. some good reasons. And let us
know about them. Take a poll—-I’m willing
to bet on who would win.

Let Schenley Hall's name remain
unchanged forever. Just because we change
the inside doesn’t mean we should change its
name. _

Would you want your name changed?

The American Family;

- 1

The conflicting needs of Americans
to be on the move while still clinging
to a sense of belonging somewhere,
or to somebody, is lamented in Mobile
Hymn, a new play being performed by
the City Theatre Company through
,April 17. Playwright Robert Litz
doesn't seem to think thereis any
hope for these conflicting forces to be
reconciled except in fleeting
moments whenthe characters of his
play adopt surrogate family members
as they search for their place in the
world. So much of what Litz says has
been said so much in recent years
about the American Family and way
of life that the subject matter

‘ becomes tedious after awhile. How-

ever, it is not the theme of this play
that is original, but thestructure.
Presented out of sequence, time
has way of escaping at a horrendous
pace yet mirroring itself over and
over._Director Jed Harris has done a
good job dealing with the difficult
script which demands fast-paced and
‘split-second timing. All the kinks
were not worked out by opening
night, but it is a credit to the abilities

’ of those involved with the production

that it worked as well as it did.
Another interesting feature of the
play, besides the flip-flop time for-

mat, is that the cast of four play
numerous roles, a Jed Harris feature
this season (he directed Howl Got That

T Story in January in which one actor

playes 20 different characters).

The most consistent performance
is given by John Hall, who plays Moll,
the son of the family in question, as
well as a hitch-hiker and a tow truck
driver. Hall's adorable air pulls in our
sympathies as Moll, in his 205, out of

work and not particularly ambitious,
is kicked out of his house by his intol-
erant and impatient father.

This situation brings up a minor
criticism of the script: The father,
played with a combination of Richard
Nixon and Archie Bunker manner-
isms by Larry John Meyers, was a jerk
and nothing but a jerk. American
society has not left time for Ozzie

ful as Bill, the mobile home salesman
who buys Mom and Dad's house after
selling them the trailerthey take off

Tony Ferrieri has once again done
an amazing job with the set, a mas-

States that expands from the back-
drop over the entire set floor.,

ness of these characters, the produc-

its unique form, awesome setting and

Key Exchange

Plagued last season by artistic and technical problems, the Fine Line
Theatre Company has been doing a much better job this year, holding its
own and making positive contributions to the Pittsburgh show scene. They
have given us the musical, Foxy, featuring Bingo O’Malley (you can't go
wrong with Bingo) and a rather good version of True West, their most recent
offering. Key Exchange, a comedy by Kevin Wade, represents an unfortunate
backslide into old habits and old problems.

The biggest of these problems is simply the choice of the script. Key
Exchange is the first playwriting effort of former actor Wade, and it is not a
bad one. It is not good, either, and director Robert Koch gives us a produc-
tion that, as a whole, is merely competent. A weak script can be salvaged by
exciting acting and directing; a lackluster production can be saved by an
excellent script. A so—so interpretation of a so-so script, though, produces
only a so—so evening in the theater.

Set entirely on a New York City bicycle trail, Exchange examines the
romantic problems of three cyclists. The novelty of watching the actors
make their entrances and exits pedaling furiously on their bikes wears off
quickly, and we are left with Wade's ‘observations about life and love,
roughly on the same level of profundity as an episode of love, American Style.

Richard Willing, a recent import into the Pittsburgh theater scene, gives a

 

’Theatre, Oakland, through April 3.

performance that almost rescues Exchange from its relentless banality. As an
advertising copywriter whose dancer-wife has left him for her composer
lover, Willing is touching without being sentimental. His sense of comic
timing is deft and thoroughly professional, and we come to genuinely care
about him and his marital problems. Most of Exchange’s laughs (and there
aren't enough of them) are generated by Willing,fmost notably in a wildly
energetic monologue about the joy of flying down the bike trailnin the
second act. But Willing’s talent, formidable as it. is, evokes Custer’s last
stand. Despite the obvious courage, there are simply too many Indians.

Curt DeBor, who did a fine job of directing True West, plays a would-be
mystery writer who can't give his love to his number one lady unless he has
room to move. Eclipsed by Willing, DeBor’s work is generally good, and he
does hold his own in the production.

Bonnie Gilmore is largely a liability as DeBor’s lover, trying vainly to
pressure him into a lasting commitment. Gilmore has enormous problems
with concentration; she acts for only minutes at a time, sliding for the most
part into a superficial recitation of her lines.

Koch's direction is uninspired but competent, with one big ‘exception. He
has blocked much of the action with his actors sitting or lying on the stage.
Since the audience is seated higher than the playing area, those without
front row seats spend large portions of scenes studying the hair styles of
those sitting in front of them. V

Koch at least has faith in his work, and is offering the money back
guarantee policy he initiated last season for his Modigliani. If you don't like
the play, you don't pay. Under these circumstances, it isworth the risk to
see Richard Willing’s work. Key Exchange continues at the Famous Rider

JOE JACKSON

March 23, 1983
Stanley Theatre

By I-‘RAN K DIGIACOMO

Joe Jackson is no traditionalist-—he
has never let himself get that lazy.

His music, his lyrics and his whole.

attitude toward performing have
always . been impassioned with an
unquenchable spirit to be different at
any cost. He has stretched his talents
to transcend rock-n-roll and has
grasped a musical universality that
few artists have the guts to attain.
Jackson's concert at The Stanley last
week was a beautiful and inspired
affirmation which proved that no one
can mar this spirit of his.

Fromthe moment he and his ba_nd

doled out the chords to ”On The

Radio,” Jackson snarled, quipped and
grinned his way through a two—hour
knockout set thatdelved into each of
his five albums. Whether stuffing his
lanky, six-foot frame underneath the
piano or jiving upstage at the mike,
Jackson always let on that he was
having a good time with what he was
doing—there was fire in his eyes, but
the smile, .whether it was a smirk or a

leer, never left his face.

After a percolating version of

"Another World,"Jackson stepped up
‘to the mike and delivered one of the

many satirical comments that would
pepper the set like Parmesan on a
well-crafted pizza. ”lt’s a pleasure to
play to a half-empty club,” he
prodded, kidding about the nearly
sold—out crowd. ’’It’s more of a
challenge—for you!”

The dare had been issued. Jackson

didn't‘ want screaming masses beat-
ing him with idolatry measured in
decibels. He wanted people to listen,
not just hear—he so much as said so
during another one of his banter
sessions. This would not be easy,
though, as a small portion of the
audience insisted on yelling and
screaming through Jackson's quiet
songs. Eventually,’ Jackson got his
wish, largely ‘through the help of
audience members who "sshhshed”
the loudmouths into silence.

The most striking element of Jack-
son's live performance is his refusal
to reproduce the songs as they appear
on his albums. His live arrangements
innovative and——at times-
shocking, though always done with
the same verve that sets his albums
apart from the melting pot of vinyl.
This tour utilizes no guitar, only bass,
drums, keyboards and percussion.
Still, the arrangements offered no
compromise, only some fresh ways of
hearing old songs. "Is She Really
Going Out With Him?” was done a
Capella in a doo-wop style, ”Sunday
Papers” with accented bass and some
Vibraphone tinkering by Jackson, and
even ”Look Sharp" made everyone
forget the absence of six more
strings.

Part of the credit for pulling off this
guitar-less feat goes to Jackson's
crack band of musicians. Bassist Gra-
ham Maby, the only original member
of the band, is Jackson's foundation.
Maby’s playing is simple but defini-
tive, while percussionist Sue Hadjo-

puolos adds salsa spice with her

whirlwind polyrhythms.
Nonetheless, Jackson carries the

weight of the show with his talents.
Whether it was the Vibraphone, the
saxophone, the piano or just vocals,
this skinny man with the swollen face
and receding hairline puts his all into
every minute of his performance. It
was his honesty that made ”Real
Men" the most poignant song of the
set—a true cry against sexism that

was his cool that made "Beat Crazy
so incredibly funky; and it was his
style that made the old ”Tuxedo Junc-
tion” sound so new. It was Joe Jack-
son's soul set to music.

”A Slow Song" was to be the final
song of the set, and once more Jack-
son asked for quiet. ”This song has

well, consider that 1984 is less than 8
months away and our president has
gone on TV to talk about laser wea-

this, right? Joe Jackson and the
Thompson Twins played the Stanley

bothered to bring that pioneering
instrument along, which really isn't
that startling considering that the
former has gone to a piano-based set

about what they think——it's about the
last dance of the evening, the most
important dance." With that, Jackson
entered into a heart-clutching rendi-
tion that seemed to sum up the
night——a wonderful one, indeed.
The single encore was to contain
’'I'm The Man" and a Motown/Tamla
medley that included ”Uptight,”
’.’Tears Of A Clown," ”Heatwave"
and "How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By
You)." Everyone was still dancing as
the band, except for Jackson, left the

that one instrument and dismissing
the genre, even for a night, will take
some getting used to.

In the case of the Thompson
Twins, what prevented a genuinely
well—played and performed concert
from succeeding fully wasn't the
breaking of any tradition or the pre-
tensions of some save-the-world cru-
sade, it was simply a lack of room.
Seeing a dance band within the con-
fines of this or any other theater is
like listening to Motown in the back
seat of a Fiat, one can't help but
become claustrophobic. Sure, you can
venture out into the sloping aisles,
try to move your feet on the cheap
red carpet, get hassled by the promot-
er's thug squad and then retreat to
the beer line, but is it worth it?

TOM PETTYINICK LOWE 8: PAUL
CARRACK

March 28. 1983

Civic Arena

By TODD ERKEL
Tom Petty has fought, and won, a

lot of battles of late; whether contest-
ing his record company’s profit

 motives or struggling with a crippling

throat ailment, he has persevered.
Performing live presents Petty with
yet another conflict—deciding how
to pacify his sometimes restless
mainstream audience and still -main-
tain a level of musical integrity.
His last appearance here failed
disastrously—Petty and Co. were
blown off the stage by the opening
act, a country—western, blues, rock-
n-roller named Joe Ely. With the likes
of Paul Carrack and Nick Lowe on
this bill, the chances of history
repeating itself were good enough to
ask why Petty didn’t‘just go it alone.
While Carrack and Lowe did a more

than adequate job, their set, which

enough dramatic touches, using the
screens and back lighting to create
shadowy figures of the various band
members, to cover any thin spots.
”Lies" arrived about midway through
the show, just in time to get everyone

’ out of their seat and dancing, and the
Twins sustained the excitement until
”In The Name'Of Love” could bring
another surge.

The Thompson Twins returned to
do another rendition of "Lies” before
calling it a night, and the brevity of
the concert seemed amiable to all.
This new sound, rhythm-heavy and
guitar-less, reaches the saturation

point after more than an hour, and
any attempt to prolong it, (could you
imagine a synthesizer solo?) would
only cheapen the effort. Like the title

alternated between the two's mate-
rial, rushed by too quickly. Carrack’s
vocals shined nevertheless. The sway
of his R& B melodies on songs like ”I
Need You” and "How Long” con-
trasted nicely with Lowe’s shaking

rockabilly.
Petty creeped out onto the stage

looking half like the law and half like
its breaker; his loose-fitting shirt and
black leather vest lacked only a badge,
but his straggly blond hair and chi-

seled features were those of an out- ‘ ’

law. Three things immediately
became evident: the volume had been
cranked up way too loud, the
audience had no plans of sitting back
down, and Tom Petty still wasn't sure
what to do in front of 7,000 people.

After ripping through the opener,
"One Story Town,” he tried to loosen
up with a little dance step, some-
where between a flamenco and the
twist, but it didn't work. It got a roar,
as did the line "her money and her
cocaine" in the next song, ”Listen To
Her Heart,” but these were kids of

wanted it quick, they wanted it uni-
form and they really didn't give a shit
of what it was made. For the first half
of the set, that's just what was deli-
vered. ”Thing About You," from the
Hard Promises album and the smash
single "You Got Lucky" had fleeting
moments of diversion, mainly involv-

ing Benmont Tench’s organ, but then

Petty would quickly get back to the
song and when it ended, hevwould
start fidgeting again, raising his arms
in the air, scratching his head or just
staring at the audience.

The audience returned the favor by
pelting Petty throughout the night,
mostly with women's lingerie or
flowers, but in the absence of those,
anything (Frisbees, discarded con-
tainers, etc.) would do.

Fittingly, it took ”The Waiting” td
lift Petty out of this rut. The song

The most common problem
with syntho-pop is that, while
the music may be smooth and
soothing, it often lacks an
edge—there's no flesh and
blood, so to speak. The Human
League, for example, has bright
melodies, scintillating rhythms
and great vocals, but, put it ..ll

' together and it sounds weirdly

off. Real passion is missing in
the likes of The League,
Orchestral Manoeuvres In The
Dark and Depeche Mode,but
bands like -Roxy Music (the

grandfathers of the genre) and
now Heaven 17 have overcome
this artificiality.

Marty Ware and Ian Craig
Marsh left the Human League
in its pre-Dare days and formed
Heaven 17 with vocalist Glenn

Gregory. Their debut British a

on this album, is indicative of
half of the group's identity:

. . . and now it's 1983 and time
for . . . a new Ramones album, of
course! ‘Just like their other
seven U.S. releases (their stu-
pendous double live album is
import-only) Subterranean jungle
is heavy on two-chord guitars
and light on thought. Thank
God for minimal rock and roll.

The band have undergone a,

change, though, after nine
years: Markie Ramone is gone
and, Richie Beau is now taking
care of the drumming chores.
(Note that Richie hasn't adopted
the usual surname; according to
the original Ramones,'that joke

saIary.") But, as far as the eye or
ear can tell, that is the only
change. The songs, of course,
have different titles and lyrics,
but they're still the kind you
don't have to think about for a
week to understand. Dee Dee
Ramone’s "Psycho Therapy,”
for example, is about as deep as
the Ramones get when com-
menting on life: "I like takin' Tui-
nal/It keeps me edgy and mean/I am a
teenage schizoid/I am a teenage dope
fiend.”

‘One cut's as good as another,
but personal favorites are
"Time Bomb" ("I'm gonna brag
about it/Gonna kill my mom and
dad/I won't be sad about it/'cause they
treat me so bad."), "Outsider " and
especially, the very creative

« "Everytime I Eat Vegetables, It

Makes Me Think Of You."

So if you like loud, fast, simple
music that you honestly believe
you yourself could singlplay,
get a copy of Subterranean ]ungle,
or any of the Ramones‘ other
albums, for that matter. There's
no discernable difference.

release some new vinyl to the

‘local record scene that ‘merits

some attention, though not too
much.

This is Ground Zero’s first
release on, apparently, their
own label. It is a four-song
maxi-single that hearkens back
to the band's old days as a Clash

cover band (though a good one I
at that). While the group seems ‘

to have come up with some
decent original material, they
are still dwelling in the Strum-
merllones shadows of raw-
throated vocals and break-neck
guitar runs. That's all fine and
dandy, but some of this material
sounds awfully similar to Give

"You Talk" and "T.V. Land”

play, this single a couple more
times. I

The F-Models aren't much of
a different story. Coming off
the release of their br_illant
"Nobody Loves MeIRussia

These two songs just don't have
the hook and the moronically
irresistible chord structure that
"Nobody” had. Singer Ig
Nition’s evil imp vocals are still
so interesting, but they don't
stand up to the noisy arrange-
ment of the title song.

In view of both these bands’
past efforts, these two singles
are not up to par——-both are cap-
able of much better.

FOR ONE WEEK ONLY: THE
WORLD OF EXPLOITATION
FILMS

By Richard Meyers

New Century

No doubt, for most people “going
to the movies" means either the old
classiscs (Wizard of Oz, Casablanca, etc.)
or the new, big-budget technical
showcases (E.T., Star Wars, etc.). But
beneath (often far beneath) the
world of these films there lives
another cinema, an often rank, bes-
tial, unbearable cinema: the cinema
of exploitation.

Exploitation films exploit every
aspect of the film-going experience:
its audience (through posters that lie
about a film or through the renaming
of films to bring in more viewers); its
subjects (one of the basic rules of the
exploitation film is to target specific
-audiences by appealing to their most
base desires and dreads——-
unfortunately, too often this means
films that exploit women for the
sake of male spectators) and its tech-
niques (many of the films seem to
have been made on the most minis-
cule of budgets; the stories make no
sense, the photography is murky, the
editing appears to have been done
with a vegi-matic). The point of the
exploitation movie is to move in on a
topic that's hot (even if it's hot with
only a very specific kind of

audience—how many people are
going to Mother, Flesh Feast or The/Liver
Eaters?) and try to make a fast killing
(pun intended). Yet the very success
of many exploitation films (and the
fact that big studios have entered the

exploitation market) suggests that

these films shouldn't be dismissed
but analyzed. They have the power to

reveal a side of humanity that we _

would no doubt like to disavow but
which vibrates malevolently beneath
our benign surfaces, showing up the
limitation of our pretensions.
Richard Meyers’ For One Week Only
is a coffee-table book introduction to
the exploitation film, and it simul-
taneously bears all the virtues and
weaknesses of the coffee-table var-
iety of writing. On the one hand,
Meyers has begun an important task
for our understanding of popular
culture by unearthing a mass of

-exploitation films and chronicling

the details of their production (a for-
midable task since the films are often
renamed rereleases of European pro-
ductions completely changed by a
dubbing that keeps nothing of the
original story). just learning that
people ever made films like Satan's
Cheerleaders, Vampire Hookers or The
Toolbox Murders can be an enlighten-
ing experience for anyone interested
in the potential boundaries and
dimensions of human taste.

On the other hand, the coffee-
table format prevents Meyers from
any kind of extended analysis of the
films. He gives us beautiful repro-
duction of movie posters (my favor-
ite is the poster for the triple feature
of Revenge of the Living Dead, Curse of the
Living Dead and Fangs ofthe Living Dead
that announces that "If you lose your
mind as a result of viewing this
explosion of terror, you will receive
free psychiatric care or be placed in
an asylum”), but for such fascinating
material, Meyers offers only the
most minimal of insights, the most

T"

cliched conclusions (do we really
need to be told again that movies
exploit violence more than sex?).
Meyers begins with a history of
exploitation that is laughable in its
inaccuracy and its ‘reductiveness.
Thereafter, the book is composed of
blurbs on individual films of impor-
tant directors; these blurbs are,
unfortunately, little more than
assertions of Meyers’ taste (a taste,
moreover, which seems to change its
criteria and values from moment to
moment).

It's saddening to read a book like
this, a book which could have said so
much. Meyers did his homework
(how many people can boast of seeing
both Harem Keeper of the Oil Sheilcs and
Ilsa, She Wolf of the 55?), and he seems to
possess that kind of critical distance
from the exploitation film that could
have led him to significant observa-
tion. But the book is, finally, a mess,
an intimation of a world worth
exploration, but little more than one
more exploitation in itself.

ering. You Can Write A Romance.’ won't
tell you, although it lures you into its
pages with ”stop wishing and start

writing,” a basic, step-by-step guide!’
to writing your own successful.ro- "L

mance novel!”

The content is unsurprisingly and
generally simplistic, far from the
anticipated, detailed model-airplane
kit type instructions. The "Nitty-
Gritty of Writing a Novel” chapter
comes closest to revealing the actual
processes.

As a neophyte author, you should
first choose a publishing house to
which you'd like to send your com-
pleted manuscript. After reading fiv”é
or six of that company's typical books
and diagramming the plots, you
should get a general idea of the
procedure. Then, outline your own
plot, basing it on the company's for-
mat. Next, some decisions about
viewpoint and the names and des-
criptions of the characters need to be
reached. Finally, feed a sheet of paper
into your typewriter and write a
romance. ”Good luck,” MacManus
says.

She offers some useful informa-
tion about techniques of dialogue,

narrative and characterization, bu-3'1:

it's rather sketchy. More than half of
the book is devoted to the
aftermath——what to do with that
manuscript you've just finished. The
submission and acceptance and edit-
ing processes are thoroughly and
optimistically detailed.

As a successful romance novel edi-
tor and author, Yvonne MacManus is
qualified to write a book like You Can
Write A Romance’, and it's well-
intentioned but inconclusive. Mac-
Manus will not generate much
competition from new writers using
her book as a road map.

Panther spikers Bill Rubosky [left], Tim Rakovan will play key

starting roles in Ball State Classic.

By scorr DELLETT

Pitt baseball coach Bobby
Lewis wished he could have put
the wonderful weather Pitts-
burgh had in late February and
early March in a bottle. Now,
Mother Nature has betrayed the
Panthers, releasing the cold, wet
weatherthat typifies this time of
year and causing the postpone-
ment of a doubleheader slated
for yesterday.

No one enjoys this weather less
than Lewis. Cold, damp weather
means postponed games, which
in turn makes late April and
early May a hectic time for the
baseball team as coaches try to
find open dates to reschedule
games.

The benefit of the earlier
weather and the Florida tour
may be neutralized by the time
lost now.

“There's no doubt that the
time off will disrupt the flow of
the team," Lewis said. “That’s
why we didn’t schedule many
games early."

The Panthers aren’t scheduled
for another game until next
Thursday. Also, the team is not
holding formal workouts until
early next week so the players
can catch up in school.

Lewis looks at the break with
optimism, though.

“It will give a coupleguys a
chance to heal, receive treatment
and get better for the rest of the ’

". id.  . .

Another problem Lewis has to
face every year is the odd term
schedule Pitt has. When most
teams are in the meat of their
schedules, Pitt is holding final
exams, which obviously limits
the number of games they can
play. With the backlog of games
caused by the weather, the
Panthers run into the problem of
scheduling games before the
middle of May—-when the other
schools break for the summer.

“We have to reschedule games
like that,” Lewis said. “There’s
only so many weeks to the sea-
son, and we have to get all our
games in before May l4.”

However, Lewis doesn’t look
at the situation disfavorably.

“Ending the semester early
gives the kids a better chancein
the job market,” he said.
“Besides, only three players live
outside a 30-mile radius of the
campus, so most can commute to
games and practice.”

When the Panthers do return
to action next week-weather
permitting, of course-—they will
have to play six games in a span
of four days. Pitt will play dou-
bleheaders with Carnegie-
Mellon on Thursday, West
Virginia on Saturday and Frede-
nia State on Sunday, all at Trees
Field.

But those are the difficulties a
baseball coach in the Northeast
must face. Besides the oppo-
nents, he must battle Mother
ture.  L

Stiffcompetition, Nationally-Ranked T
TeamsTo Be Featured In Tourney

By MARK A. SINDLER

No one player stood out individu-
ally, but each one got the job done as
the Pitt volleyball squad waltzed to
an easy three-game sweep of Robert
Morris on Wednesday night at Trees
Hall.

Itiwas the third meeting of the two
teams in the last two and a half
weeks, and again, the ‘script called
for the same outcome. The Panthers
controlled the first-year Colonials
throughout the best-of-five match
15-0, 15-5, 15-7.

Assistant coach Mike Gordon
elaborated on the team effort and on

the nearly ﬂawless play of a Panther ~

team that dropped two crucial
matches to Penn State and George
Mason within the previous week.

“They executed really well,” Gor-
don said. “It was a pretty easy match
with’ the one big difference being
that the players didn’t let themselves
go. They didn’t fooliaround.”

Perhaps that may have been part i

of the reason that Pitt succumbed so
easily to PSU and GM, but Gordon
said the matches “were two different
ballgames.” t

The Panthers will meet the Nit-
tany Lions for the~third time this
season when the squad travels to
Muncie, Ind., for the Ball State
Classic. Only in its second year as a
four-school round-robin, the tour-
nament will also see Ohio State com-
peting. .

This is a weekend that will most
likely see coach Ray Reilly and his
freshmen-dominated squad row
through some very turbulent waters.
Reilly’s players have not shown, at
least record-wise, that they can

defeat the better-established teams.

With only one league win over
East Stroudsburg to boast about, if

that can be called boasting, the
Panthers have already turned soft
against George Mason (two losses),
Penn State (three losses) and Ohio
State (two losses, one tie).

Against these tea-ms, only the
records really count. For all intents
and purposes, though, Reilly’s
troops have been able to play“deuce
ball” with the top—caliber players
that earmark such worthy
opponents.

When it comes down to the crucial
moments, when the line must be
drawn between a win and loss, the
Panthers cannot put the match
away. Maybe the freshmen overpop-
ulation is too much of a mountain to
climb.

One thing is for sure,“-though. If
prior experiences are any indication,
and ‘there is no reason to think they
shouldn’t be,/ the Panthers should
complete the Ball State Classic in the
pre-determined fourth spot. '

How does a coach deal with such
circumstances? Knowing. that the
possibility of winning is so weak and
that his team might be lucky to get
out of town with its neck still in
place, what can a coach do to help
his players dismiss these facts?

Gordon, still an assistant to
fourth-year man Reilly, admits that
it all comes down to a matter of what
the players know lies. ahead and
what can be accomplished with the
tools at hand. ‘

“It all comes down to a question
of pride,” he said. “every athlete has
it, and sooner or later they come up
against those big guns of a Penn

State or a Ball State. But it’s not
whether youwin or lose-—you just
have to play as well as you can.”

Gordon will also attest to the fact
that the Panthers\haven’t done that
in past matches. Consistency has
been the foremost casualty in the
team’s play.

“The team has been inconsistent,” ,

Gordon said. “There have been
flashes of brilliance, then there have
been times we've been in a. deep rut.
That’s hard to deal with.”

It would be easy to blame all of
Pitt’s problems on the large number
of freshmen on the squad, but, Gor-
don said, “The freshmen have been a
definite factor, but in a differet way.
We have maturefreshmen. It has to
do with the fact that there are so
many. C '

. “They have to deal with that and
are doing, I think, pretty well.”

Once in Muncie, perhaps their
thoughts will turn to Feb. 13, the day
the squad lost a tough match to
Penn State in five games and came
that close to defeating a then-ﬁfth-
ranked team.

The team will get all the chances it
wants this weekend as it goes head-=
to-head with three nationally-

‘ranked schools. In the Ball State

Classic, it hasn’t always been that
way. Up until two years ago, Cardi-
_nal' coach Don Shondell used to
invite up to eight schools to his
annual pow-wow.
“The format was changed,” Shon-
dell said, “because we just think it’s
fairer when every pair goes at it with-
out the subjective approach. What
usually happens is teams don’t
always like where they’re slotted at

Open Season For Harriers

By CHARLIE O‘HARA

The Panther track team opens the
outdoor season this weekend at the
Colonial Relays in Williamsburg,
Va.

The meet attracts as many North-
eastern schools as Southern schools.
“There are usually somewhere
around 70 to 75 schools,” Pitt head
coach John Vasvary said. '

“It depends on the year. Many of
the big track schools attend, like Vil-
lanova, Virginia and Maryland, but
as far as this year goes, I’m not sure
what teams will be there.

“The Dogwood and Penn relays
are more prestigious, but there are
several reasons for that. Many of the
teams enter the Colonials with the
idea of getting a race under their
belt. This way, they will have some
indication where they are at as well
as where the other teams competing
are at.“ '

“This is our basic intention behind
this meet. We, as well as many ofthe
other teams competing, are in train-
ing and will be running off of the

B strength that we have built up over

the past six months.”

Fourteen Panthers are entered in
10 different events. On the track,
Brian Mitchell will run the I00-
meter dash. Darryl Shepherd will
compete in the ll0-meter high hur-
dles while Brian Pollock and Mario
Joyner will run the 400-meter inter-
mediate hurdles. In the l,500-meter
run, Todd Colas will represent the

us if Photo

am Moorhead - pan of may team.

The Panthers will also field three
relay teams——the 3,200-meter team
of Darren Geary, Terry Gallagher,
Garland Brown and Bill Moorhead,
the sprint-medley team of Rich
Baderinwa, Rick Asberry, Joyner
and Geary and the distance-medley
team of Gallagher, Pollock, Colas
and Moorhead. '

In the field events, Ralph Mitton
will compete in the triple jump, and

- Andrew (Berry and Andy Monaski

will participate in the discus event.
Berry is also scheduled for the

The outdoor is another chance for
Panthers to regan that respect
that has" been missing for the past
several years. They would like to

prove that their accomplishments“

during the indoor season were not a
fluke. Though this weekend's meet
will not have a tremendous influence
on the remainder of the season, it
will be a confidence-builder if they
can get it off to a good start.

“We want to be compctitve,” Vas-
vary said, “but we won‘t‘be disap-
pointed with less-than,-spectacular

'mes." . ' A B

bigger tournaments and the host
team is known to schedule matches
against weaker teams to get to the
ﬁnals—-it's all a very subjective
approach.”

With this in mind, Shondell
sought more fairness in scheduling
invitationals as well as the addition
of a bit of excitement to the competi-
tion between top-ranked schools.

“The trend is to have less teams,’
Shondell added, “and a more dra-
matic tournament where there's only
one game going on at a time and all
the matches are played on our main
court. From the spectators stand-

I

point, it’s a much more interesting

tournament to watch."

One very interesting thing to
watch for in the classic will be the big
matchup toni_g_ht between Shondell’s

Cardinals and OSU coach Jim
Smoot’s Buckeyes. Smoot is 0-3
against Ball State, a team that plays
in the same league, this season.

“It's definitely a big match,”
Smoot said. “It’s not necessarily
which team wins the league, but
which one is the NCAA representa-
tive (come playoff time). We have to
beat them at least three times out of
our next four meetings to win the
league.”

What makes Smoot so sure of
himself, in light of three straight
losses to Ball State, is his team’s
transition from a group playing‘ as
individuals to a group playing as a
unit duringthe last several weeks.

Smoot could not overly stress
tonight‘s matchup. “Its a pretty
important match for us because
that's our first match of the tourna-

ment and anything we do after that
agianst Pitt or Penn [State] would
be gravy, I guess,” he said.

Beating Ball State even takes
precedence over the Buckeyes’ win-
ning the classic’s championship.
'“That’s the most important thing for
us right now—beating them.”

According to Shondell, tonight
will probably be OSU’s most oppor-
tune moment to reign victorious.
Cardinal hitters Brian Hyde and
Tom Pingel——both key starters——are
out with various injuries and won’t
start, Shondell said. i

“If OSU can‘t beat us with Hyde
and Pingel not in there,” Shondell
said, “how are they going to beat us
two weeks from now when they’re
back in there? So it puts more pres-
sure on them than it does on us. We
know we’re in trouble, so from a

 Stiff Tourney Competition Ahead For Spikers

psychological standpoint, we’re just
going out there and give it all we’ve
got.”

Shondell is reluctant to make any
predictions about the weekend. He
recalled last year’s classic, one com-
prising the same field with Grace-
land College in place of Pitt.

“The only really predictable thing
about it was that Graceland finished
fourth,” Shondell said. “OS U, who I
thought would probably finish
third, ended up winning it, and Penn
State, who I thought would win it,
finished third. The thing was really
weird.

“So, it's really hard to say, but I
would be really surprised if it turns
out to be Penn State, Ball State,
OSU and Pitt, finishing in that
order,” he said.

Conference Calling....

After I2 years as an independent,
South Carolina may join a basket-
ball conference. Athletic Director
Bob Marcum favors a conference
affiliation for the school, but would
not specify which league the Game-
cocks might join. The most likely
choice seems to be the Metro
Conference. ‘

Marcum said the only possible
conferences for the school to join are
the Southeastern, the Atlantic
Coast, and the Metro.

He dismissed the likelihood of
joining the SEC and ACC. The
Metro comprises Louisville, Mem-
phis State, Cincinnati, Virginia
Tech, Tulane and Southern
Mississippi.

NBA Ratification

O’Brien yesterday announced at a

players association. The four-year

pact, if ratified by the players, will
avert the strike proposed by the

~ players for Saturday, April 2.

“It is a landmark agreement in
professional sports,” O’Brien said.
“The contract contains many unique
aspects that will be enormously
helpful for owners and players." ‘

The union has been playing with-
out a contract since last summer; if
the latest areement is ratified, it will
take effect starting next season.

T hree-Point Demise...

It appears that the three-point
play in college basketball may be
remembered as just another
experiment. .

According to Dr. Edward Steitz,
athletic director of Springfield Col-
lege and the head of the NCAA rules
committee, the three-point play will

Also, the shot clock may go into
still another year of experimen-
tation.

In a poll given by the NCAA, 87
