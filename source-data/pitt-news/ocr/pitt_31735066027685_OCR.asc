Pitt students, faculty, and staff could
only watch in silence as efforts to save their
votes on Pitt Trustee committees were
ignored at Thursday’s full Board meeting.

The committee investigating the struc-
ture of the Board recommended that stu-
dent, faculty, and staff committee members
be reduced to non-voting representatives.

The Board voted unanimously to
implement the change, effective July 1,
1997.

Justin Da1Molin and member Christa
Douaihy expressed outrage that their peti-
tion with more than 800 signatures to save
the votes was not mentioned in the meeting
until after the Board’s decision was ﬁnal.

The Trustees’ refusal to release the
investigation results caused the SGB to
begin the petition among undergraduates to
save the votes.

The signatures were turned in to

Trustee Secretary Robert Dunkleman on
Wednesday, and, fearing a large protest
from members of the Pitt community, the
Trustees stationed Pitt Police at the doors of
the meeting. V

But no protest occurred.

“Representation and support are good,
but I didn’t want to rally a million students
here if their support would not be viewed as
positive,” said SGB President Justin

Pittsburgh City Council President Jim Ferlo announced Friday
that he and Mayor Tom Murphy will reach a decision on the Bigelow
Boulevard permanent closing proposal later this week.

Murphy voted in favor of the trial closing last year, while Ferlo
has vehemently opposed the idea of a closing from its inception, call-
ing it an “absurd proposal” at a public hearing last year.

“We are attempting to resolve what the city’s position will be,”
said Ferlo last Friday in a phone interview. He went on to say he
expects a press conference on the joint stance by this Friday.

Neither party has hinted to what type of compromise will be

made in their new allegiance.

Ferlo’s aides said the announcement will be based on the city’s
own Bigelow study report. They also expect that Pitt’s separate report
results from an independent contractor will be considered in the

announcement. A

The Athletics Debate

Having a number like $9 million
ﬂoating around while academic units
may be getting fouled has led many peo-
ple to say that Pitt officials need to
watch the instant replay and deﬁne the
university’s priorities.

In a Jan. 16 letter to the provost, the
Graduate Student Organization criti-
cized administrators for a “lack of
vision” about the direction of the school
and the University as a whole.

“This lack of vision is particularly
dismaying in light of recent public
events and statements which indicate
that the administration regards a nation-
ally-ranked athletic department as cen-
tral to its mission (despite the millions
this non—acadernic pursuit loses annual-

Harrisburg, PA — Faculty in the state uni-
versity system ratiﬁed a contract settlement
that limits the hiring of temporary instruc-
tors but freezes salaries through this year.

Negotiations for the state system of
higher education and the faculty union
armounced a tentative agreement on the
three—year accord last month. The union
rank and ﬁle cast ballots this week, and it
awaits management approval.

One—third of the more than 3,000 union
members who voted on the pact opposed it.

Union leaders said that this incident repre-
sented the most votes against a tentative
contract since the faculty began collective
bargaining in 1971. 
The pact retains a cap on the numbero

part-tirne temporary faculty members who
may be hired which the union demanded.
Faculty members will have to wait until the
1997-98 academic year for a raise. They’ll
have a 2 percent increase next year and
three percent the following year. Associated

SGB gives $1,

THE PITT NEWS 3

536 for three

more to go to conference

‘Megan Borofski

Three more students will be on
their way to Washington, D.C. this
April, bringing Pitt’s total delegation
at a national conference to fight for
access to higher education to eight.

The Student Government Board
voted last Wednesday to provide
$1,536 in funding to the
Governmental Relations Committee
for an additional three students to
attend the United States Student

Association’s Ledgecon Conference

in April.

The decision was made after SGB
President Justin DalMolin broke the
board’s 4-4 tie vote.

“I’m disappointed,” said USSA
board member Aisha Anderson.
“They knew how important it was for
us to have the full. delegation of 10,
and I believe that decision will affect
Pitt. I don’t think that we are going to
be able to fully represent our
University. However, I’d rather have
three extra spots than none at all.”

Before the decision, SGB had
already provided funding for five
spots. Three of those spots are
reserved for the three USSA board
members at Pitt: ‘Anderson, Adam
Neary, and Keith Campbell. Neary
said the fourth will probably go to the
head of the Federal Relations section
of the Governmental Relations
Committee, Flora Sweeney. That
leaves four spaces open.

“For an extra $300, they could
have sent all 10,” said Neary, the
GRC chair and USSA’s Keystone
Garden regional chair, which covers
Pennsylvania and New Jersey. “It

«IIIOTC 01° 1688 SCCIIIS IO have COIIIC

down to cost. For a conference that
brings together students to share their
ideas and fight for their rights, [the
decision] is a denial for more students
to have that opportunity.”

The USSA is a national group that
fights for the rights of students in uni-
versities across the country. It is the
largest and oldest student association,
and members from different delega-
tions around the country come togeth-
er in D.C. to lobby for access to high-
er education programs.

The money allocated to the
Governmental Relations Committee
for the trip includes the $120 registra-
tion fee per student, rental of a van for
the transportation to Washington,
D.C., two hotel rooms (one male and
one female), and $20 per person for
food for each day of the four-day con-
ference.

“When I sent in the request for the
money, I wanted to find a way to

 

make the conference trip the least
expensive in order to get as many
people to have the opportunity to go
as possible,” Neary said.

Anderson thinks that Pitt students
will be directly affected by the
board’s decision.

“We could have brought so many
strong leaders back to campus with us
when we returned,” she said. “I think
we are depriving students and our stu-
dent groups of those leaders.”

Board member Brandi Miller was
against allocating the money for the
trip.

“I think that ﬁve students was
plenty for a lobbying effort,” she said.
“And I also think that five students
was sufficient enough to represent
Pitt on a national level. I didn’t see
the necessity to send extra students.
But now that they are going, I think
they will doa fine job.”

Miller said that her vote may have
been different if the board was told
who the extra students would be.

“The Governmental Relations
Committee does not currently have
the three extra people. I would have
liked to know who they were,” she
said. “I don’t know if those who are
going to be selected [for the confer-
ence] will be effective. I could justify
better going with three if I knew the
candidates, when I think that five
people would do just fine.”

Board member Christa Douaihy,
the president pro tempore in control
of the board while President Justin
DalMolin is away on business, went
to USSA’s Ledgecon last year.

“I would not have gotten involved
in student government if it were not
for USSA,” she said. “Because of
Ledgecon, senators know the
University of Pittsburgh students by
name, some students become experts
at lobbying for financial aid, and
other student needs are met. We need
USSA.”

Douaihy also commented that
there had been some controversy
regarding whether Pitt spends too
much time lobbying at the national
level.

“My answer is this: How can a
university survive if it doesn’t pro-
vide adequate financial aid? How can
a university be successful if there is
no student activism? That’s what
USSA does for this university.”

Students interested in applying
for the conference may stop in the
SGB office in room 639 of the
William Pitt Union and talk to Neary
or Campbell. Neary said that he is
currently making up the applications,
and they will be ready at the end of
this week.

Pitt’s Department of Neuroscience is one of the top five in the nation
among departments that offer a systems approach in this multidisciplinary

new athletic director is going to imple-
ment, is going to get revenue-producing
sports to be self-supporting soon,” said
Maher. “They are very serious about
that.”

_ Phillips said the difference between
his $4.8 million and the total $9 million is
made up in administrative overhead and
that “you can apply that percentage
against any unit.”

“The $9 million number you’re hear-
ing is the fact that the Higher Education
Act requires a full-costing of athletics,”
Phillips said.

Phillips said that every area of the
University has indirect expenses that
include things covered by the central
administration like processing purchase
orders and other costs the core adrninis-
tration incurs on the behalf of individual
areas.

“These aren’t real cash items,” he
said. “Some don’t affect cash ﬂow  You
could do that with any department on
campus.”

Indirect revenue and expenses in
sports are “uncontrollables,” such as
physical plant expenses like improve-
ments to Pitt Stadium and the Field
House or depreciation costs. Under a
recent Pennsylvania. law, athletic depart-
ments must include depreciation to stadi-
ums in their books. -

“We can’t control depreciation
expenses,” Phillips said. “There’s a value

THE PITT NEWS

placed on the building, and it’s depreciat-
ed over its life.”

According to Phillips, once the stadi-
um’s value and the number of years it
would take to pay it off were set, the
numbers were divided to get the annual
depreciation expense amount. Phillips
added that, had the state required depreci-
ation when the stadium was built in 1930,
it would be paid off by now.

“The indirects and the $9 million
isn’t a great number to say, ‘The
University is putting out this much
money for athletics.’... If athletics went
away, university costs in indirect would-
n’t decline in any signiﬁcant way. The
[$9 million] is a function of full costing
of the athletic department.”

According to Phillips, the athletic
department, like any other department in
the University, is budgeting what it can
control, including things like phone costs,
mailings, and travel on top of its revenue-
producing sports.

Progress?

Nordenberg said in a Feb. 3 inter-
view that progress had been made in get-
ting the athletics program into the black.

“The overall athletic program that I
inherited, which included both revenue-
producing and non-revenue-producing
sports, was operating at a substantial
deﬁcit,” said Nordenberg. “We have
made real progress in turning that situa-

 

tion around. There is more work to be
done, but all of our efforts in athletics are
geared both toward the pursuit of quality
and budgetary responsibility.”

On Feb. 19, Pederson said that no
changes had been made yet and that the
planning process was not over.

“We’re gonna start to unveil plans as
we go along,” said Pederson. “I’m not
ready at this point to start unveiling those
plans. What we want to do is build a
long-term plan, not a short-term plan, and
put the athletic department on solid fman-
cial footing over a period of many years.”

Pederson said those plans would be
ﬁnalized “over the next several months.”

“Since I’ve got here, we’ve been
intently working on our plans to go for-
ward,” said Pederson.

The chancellor could not be reached
for comment about the department’s

progress.

is the Athletics Budget Too Big?

A $9 million athletic budget has
prompted the GSO and others to raise
questions about possible budgetary real-
locations from non-academic units to
academic programs.

“Perhaps some of the problems fac-
ing FAS require a re-exarnination of
spending priorities at a higher level; i.e.,
perhaps it is the status quo of the
University-wide priorities that must be

changed,” the GSO said in a letter to the

advisory committee doing the evalua-
tions. ’
Pederson said that the athletic depart-
ment’s budget is not too big, even con-
sidering the win-loss records of some
sports. —
“I don’t think our problems at
spending too much money by any stretch.
We’re probably in the bottom half of
schools in the country in terms of spend-
ing,” said Pederson. “Our problems are
on the revenue side, selling tickets to
games, sponsorship. . .
“To compete in the Big East confer-
ence, you can’t continue to just cut and
cut away at the bare bones of a program.
We’ve gotten good at expense cuts, but
[we’ve] fallen short on revenue side.”
Pederson said some ways to generate
revenue are through ticket sales, TV con-
tracts, and getting corporations to spon-
sor games. According to Pederson, they
will be recruiting “any myriad of differ-
ent kinds of companies.” .
Phillips said that the non-revenue-
producing sports should not be expected
to turn a proﬁt. A
“On a material basis, those sports
probably will never turn any amount of
revenue that is signiﬁcant,” Phillips said.
According to Phillips, these sports
aren’t money-makers because they have
no strong fan base or TV agreements, two
things Pederson said he wanted to
improve in Pitt’s revenue-producers.

Connolly announced this at
the meeting and followed it by
saying, “Students will NOT be
representatives on all 11 commit-
tees of the Board. There is no
question about that.”

DalMolin said that kind of
unilateral decision makes him
feel a vote is necessary, because
the Trustees do not appear to care
about students’ needs.

“Students are treated like
consumers or clients at Pitt, but
they don’t get what they need or
pay for, and this is just another
example,” DalMolin said.

‘ : Brian Hart, president of the
Staff Association Council, said,
“The greatest changes in this uni-
versity over the past few years
occurred when there was an
openness of community and a
willingness to hear all sides of an
issue. But this top-down, ‘I
say/you do’ approach the
Trustees used to decide this issue
makes me worry.”

But not everyone at the

"meeting saw the vote loss as neg-

ative.

« - Trustee Ralph J. Cappy said
the new representative position
can still allow the students, facul-
ty, and staif to inﬂuence the vote,
if not participate in it themselves.

“This non—voting status par-

allels that of the Special
Trustees,” he said to the Board.
“As a Special Trustee myself, I
think this is very positive, and the
new resolution is consistent with
the way we have operated in the

,9

past.
Cappy said he approved the
vote loss because those members
of the Pitt community were not
legally responsible for the deci-
sions made by the Trustees.

“We are held responsible, so
we must function solely as

Trustee committees, and I think‘

keeping students and faculty as
representatives is a reasonable
compromise. It allows for an
extraordinary amount of partici-
pation from them.”

Connolly said he thinks the
committee votes undermined the
authority of Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg.

‘Too often in the past, lead-
ers of institutions like this are
conderrmed by people through
channels to get around the chan-
cellor,” he said. “I will not toler-
ate the various communities of
Pitt trying to circumvent the
chancellor by using the Trustees.
They have their respective gover-
nance outlets, but Mark
Nordenberg runs this institution.”

University Senate President

THE P_l'l'T NEWS

Keith McDufﬁe said he planned
to speak before the Trustees on
behalf of the faculty, but after see-
ing the resolution, he decided
there was no need because the
faculty maintain a representative
on almost all of the committees.

“The vote really was sym-
bolic, because the Trustees are the
majority on those committees,
and they make the recommenda-
tion,” he said. “If a-representative
can’t convince them of a certain
need, then the vote wouldn’t have
done anything more.”

Brian Hart said he will wait
and see how this decision affects
his constituents, but DalMolin
said he will continue to ﬁght for
more student representation.

“Unfortunately, Mr.
Connolly is misled if‘ he thinks
we are just going to accept this
decision and forget about it,”
DalMolin said.

-In other action at the meet-
ing, Provost James Maher
armounced a plan to unite career
counselors and academic advi-
sors in the hopes of providing stu-
dents with better services. He said
this new move will acquaint stu-
dents better with the campus, and
push them towards a speciﬁc

The mayor’s ofﬁce was
reluctant to comment on the prob-
ability of a Bigelow stance
announcement this soon, stating
only that they “anticipate an
announcement within the next
several wee .”

They did, however, indicate
that Pitt’s results will probably be
included when an official position
statement is ﬁnally announced.

Peg McCormick, a
spokesperson for the mayor, said
the announcement “will involve,
hopefully, all of the parties.”

During the .30-day closing
which began on Sept. 15, 1996,
the University hired an indepen-
dent contractor, Trans Associates
Engineering Consultants, to per-
form an impact study on the clos-
ing. Trans Associates has since
created a preliminary report based
on the collected data ,

The City Planning Ofﬁce
also received the data from the
study and began work on a sepa-
rate impact study report.

Sidney Kaikai, the Pittsburgh
senior transportation plarmer,
acknowledged that the city ﬁn-
ished its report last week and has
shared its ﬁndings with the uni-
versity.

Mark Magalotti, Trans
Associates’ principal-in-charge,

 

 

FROM PAGE 

said that his company has only
submitted their preliminary results
to the University.

If an announcement includes
Pitt’s results, the release of a ﬁnal
report would be much sooner than
Pitt recently intended.

A joint review of the reports
was held Jan. 13, according to Pitt
Spokesperson Ken Service. But
Service said last Thursday that it
was premature to talk about the
issue and that there is still “a lot of
data to look at.”

Service would not give an
expected release date for the ﬁnal
report results but indicated it
would not be until after the city
and Pitt have had sufﬁcient time to
thoroughly compare their reports.

News of a proposed joint
position statement came as a sur-
prise to mayoral candidate Bob
O’Connor.

“We haven’t heard a word
[about an announcement],” said
O’Connor.

O’Connor said he expects a
stance assumed by the mayor and
Ferlo would be in favor of keep-
ing Bigelow open. O’Connor has
supported keeping the Boulevard
open, as well.

“IfFerlo andthe rnayorarein
it,” said O’Connor, “it has to be
left open.”

Board of Trustees must encounter cr united Pitt

The Board of Trustees has made it
official. Students are no longer members
on its committees. Students can no
longer vote or attend executive sessions
of Board of Trustee committees. ‘

This is not necessarily a bad thing.
The student positions on the Board’s
committees allowed the Board to hide
behind the excuse that students had rep-
resentation, while actually doing all of its
business behind closed doors and
excluding those students from knowing
what was really going on. The Board
never gave our representatives enough
power to be effective and to protect our
interests; now, the pretense that we had
adequate representation no longer
stands.

Kicking students out at the very
least lets us know, without a doubt,‘ that
the Board doesn’t want to deal with us
directly. Instead, it wants us to go
through the chancellor.

If tlrat’s the way it’s got to be, then
the chancellor needs to make an effort to
communicate directly with students.
Meetings with student leaders would be
a start. Chancellor Nordenberg should
also make an effort to get out and mingle
with the students on this campus. He
should eat dinner in the dining halls, lis-
ten to the complaints of the students, and
ﬁnd out what the lives of the students are

‘ti
ﬁt:

 

like ﬁrsthand.

Just because students can neither
vote on the committees nor be present at
executive meetings does not mean that
they shouldn’t play an advisory role to
the committees. We still need to attend
the general meetings and voice our con-
cerns and opinions. The students who
were on the committees should still
attend the general meetings and serve as
an informational source to the comrrrit—
tee.

In addition, these students must
report back to their fellows and the rest of
the University. This way, students, facul-

ty, and staff know what happens at the
committee meetings.

Board members need to get out and
about in the Pitt community and see what
we deal with and are concemed about.
VVrthout students, faculty, and staff, there
is no University of Pittsburgh. The Board
needs to show us whether its “rnembers-
only” mentality will foster greater coop-
eration or wider schlsms between the
Board and the rest of the University.

When issues do come up, students
need to get together with faculty and staff
and present a united front to the Board.
The trustees need to realize that those
whose interests they are entrusted with
can produce a united front to protect
those same interests.

Is it time to get rid of nuclear
weapons? Just a few years ago, this
question would have been dis-
missed by most as a naive one.
Nuclear weapons, most people felt,
were essential to preserve the secu-
rity of the United States of America
from communist aggressors like the
USSR. However, with the collapse
of the Soviet Union, we face no
threats abroad that necessitate main-
taining our awesome nuclear arse-
nals.Itlrinkthatitistimewerethink
the role nuclear weapons play in our
defense.

In a statement issued a few
weeks ago that sttmned many mili-
tary and foreign policy drinkers,
General Lee Butler, the fonner
commander of U.S. Strategic
Command, and former NATO com-
mander Gen. Andrew Goodpaster
jointly argued in favor of rethinking
America’s policies towards nuclear
weapons. In their joint statement,
Gen. Butler (who had responsibility
for two-thirds of America’s nuclear
arsenal during his time as comrrran—
der of Strategic Command) and
Gen. Goodpaster argued: “The roles
of nuclear weapons for purposes of
security have been sharply nar-
rowed in terms of the security of the
United States. Now and in the
future, they basically provide an
option to respond in kind to a
nuclear threat or nuclear attack by
others  They are not needed
against non-nuclear opponents.”
Gen. Butler even went so far as to
suggest that the United States ought
to work towards eliminating nuclear
weapons across the globe altogeth-
er.

I think that a worldwide ban on
nuclear weapons is a little unrealis-
tic. Enforcement of such a ban

 
   

would be very difficult, given that
there are dozens of third-world
countries that lust for nuclear tech-
nology, and we simply cannot de-
invent these weapons. Also, the
world’s superpowers would be
reluctant to give up weapons that
they regard as a symbol of power
and prestige. But I agree that we
ought to drastically reduce the num-
ber of nuclear weapons in our arse-
nal. Today the United States has a
completely uncontested superiority
in conventional weaponry. No other
nation on earth has as advanced
tanks, missiles, jet ﬁghters, or war-
ships as we do, or as well-trained
personnel as we have.

In any case, nuclear weapons
don’t provide the same security they
once did. The fact that we have
nuclear weapons and Iraq didrr’t did
not dissuade Saddam Hussein from
attacking Kuwait irrAugust of 1990.
Nuclear weapons play practically
no role in the defense of the United
States. Today’s threats to American
security come primarily from terror-
ists (both domestic and foreign) and
from smaller countries like Serbia,
who cannot match America’s con-
ventional military supremacy. I once
saw a humorous cartoon that
showed a bunch of expensive
American weapons systems like the
B—lB bomber, the 0hi0—class ballis-
tic missile submarine, and the MX
missile with their price tags (all well
into the billions) attached. Next to
them was a picture of a terrorist dri-
ving a car bomb. The caption under-
neath read: “Which of these has
killed more people?” Nuclear
weapons are no longer a viable
detenent to the villains of the world.

Much has been made, for good
reason, of the frightening possibility
of renegade groups hostile to the
United States gaining control of
nuclear weapons. Practically every

Nukes are outdated relics of bygone era

action movie made today features a
plot about stolen nuclear weapons,
and novelist Tom Clancy even
wrote an entirely plausible novel
about how a single nuclear bomb
almost causes World War III. Sen.
Richard Lugar of Indiana based
much of his doomed candidacy for
the Republican norrrirration for pres-
ident of the United States in 1996
(he had the supreme misfortune of
declaring his candidacy for
President on the day of the
Oklahoma City bombing) upon the
need to ﬁght the threat of nuclear
proliferation. It is a subject that is in
the public eye for good reason. The
Russian police have stopped several
attempts to steal nuclear material,
but there will almost certainly be
more attempts to steal these
weapons in the not-so-distant future,
and what if that attempt succeeds?
Thanks to the hard work of the
Clinton administration (and in par-
ticular Vrce President Al Gore, who
has made disarming the Russian
nuclear arsenal one of his top prior-
ities as vice president) and the
Russian police, no nuclear weapons
have rrranaged to fall into hostile
hands. The possibility of renegade
nuclear weapons poses an intolera-
ble threat to the security of the
United States of America, and by
reducing both our countries’ nuclear
stockpiles, we can also reduce the
possibility of nuclear weapons
falling into the wrong hands.

President Clinton has made it
clear that he wishes to begin to work
upon his legacy now in his second
term, and I think that one of the
ways in which he can do so is if he
works towards eliminating the
threat that nuclear weapons pose to
the people of the world.

Michael Benquist thinks that we
should begin to get nd of the bomb.

Sophomores Cummings and Blount ead
Pitt to Senior Day win over Boston College

Eric Mosley

 

The last time Pitt faced Boston
College, the Panthers’ big men were intim-
idated by the Eagles inside, resulting in a
BC blowout.

Yesterday, in front of 6,583 fans at
Fitzgerald Field House, Pitt went with a
large lineup, playing 6-foot-10 senior for-
ward Gerald Jordan and 7—foot sophomore
center Mark Blount together for most of
the game. The duo combined to score 29
points in the 75-71 Panther victory.

“We’ve been toying with the big line-
up for a while,” Pitt Head Coach Ralph
Willard said. ‘‘[The lineup] sent a message
early that we were going to battle on the
backboards. That was the key against this
team. Up in Boston, they really hurt us on
the backboards, but Mark did a good job of
blocking shots, and Gerald came in and did
a real good job inside.”

“It was a typical Big East game,”
Boston College Head Coach Jim O’Brien
said. “Both teams played hard, but it
comes down to certain guys making big
plays. They had a good combination with
Blount and Jordan inside. That makes
them really big.”

Seniors Jordan, Chad Varga and Jason
Maile were honored before the game with

a senior day ceremony. The feelings they
got from the ceremony spread throughout
the team, and the Panthers played with
emotion, something they have lacked for
most of the season.

“I’m happy for the three seniors,”
Willard said. “I’m happy they went out this
way.”

Boston College got the game got off
to a fast start, taking an early 6-2 lead.
However, at the 17:36 mark of the ﬁrst,
Blount blocked a Duane Woodward shot
(his ﬁrst of six rejections on the day), then
dished the ball to sophomore guard
Vonteego Cummings, who slammed
home a one-handed jam.

On the ensuing BC possession,
Currrrnirrgs stole the ball from BC big man
Danya Abrams and threw down another
one-handed dunk that tied the game at 6-6.

Pitt then went on an 11-0 run that
increased the Panther lead to 30-19, their
biggest lead of the game.

Pitt led at the half, 40-32, while shoot-
ing 54.8 percent from the ﬁeld.

Whatever O’Brien said at halftime
must have worked — Boston College
came out in the second half and cut the Pitt
lead to two at the 16:00 mark. The
Panthers missed some easy lay-ups that
would have stopped the momentum, and

grapplers over

K'h

   

When the Panther grappling team
lined up for their ﬁnal dual meet of the
season yesterday, a familiar face
glared at them from across the mat.
Pat Santoro, Pitt’s all—time wins
leader, is now Lehigh’s assistant
coach.

“It’s great to come back. I love
being here in Fitzgerald Field House,”
Santoro said. “I don’t really think of it
as coaching against Pitt, just coaching
against our opponent.”

Lehigh probably wishes Santoro
could have suited up for the match.
Pitt won the contest 20-17 — espe-
cially impressive considering the
patchwork team the Panthers ﬁelded
due to the barrage of injuries the team
has suffered in recent weeks.

Chris Stevens’ takedown at the
end of the first period went unnoticed
by the official, leading to a 8-7 Lehigh
win at the 118-pound weight class.
Pitt’s Rob Loper responded immedi-
ately with a 12-4 win at 126. His last-
second takedown bumped the margin
to eight, which meant a major decision
and a 4-3 lead for Pitt.

Chad Jesko’s pin at 134 kept the
momentum rolling for Pitt and
increased the lead to seven.

Lehigh cut the Panther lead to
four with a minor decision victory by
Chris Ayres at 142. Pitt’s Kevin
Johnson got those three points back
with his 3-1 victory at 150.

Lehigh won three of the ﬁnal ﬁve
matches, including a technical fall at
177 and minor victories at 158 and
heavyweight, but Pitt had built up
enough of a lead to hold off its oppo-
nents.

The Panthers’ John Withrow
earned a 13-4 major decision at 167,
and Mark Bodo contributed a tough 9-
3 win at 190.

“With all the injuries we have, we
really had to come together as a team
for this win,” Withrow said. “Pretty
much everybody wrestled well, which
is important for us heading into
EWLs.”

It was also Senior Day at
Fitzgerald Field House. The Panthers
honored six graduating wrestlers:
Marc Johnson, Eric Knopsnyder, Ben
Maynard, Rick Vettorel, Chris
Stevens, and Bryan Matusic.

Panthers is the EWL Conference tour-

BC buries Lady Panthers, 84-69

.___Z'o“cl1...r:riah Bloh‘

......................... . ~

Coach Kirk Bruce should be happy
that he has a player as dependable as Latia
Howard, who has led the Lady Panthers
in scoring for 11 of the last 12 games
while averaging 17.2 points per game
during that stretch. Unfortunately, the
team has won only one game in that peri-
od. 3

The Panther squad continued those
trends at Fitzgerald Field House on
Saturday afternoon in an 84-59 loss to
Boston College, in which Howard led Pitt
with 17 points.

Howard has been forced to carry the
load since the team’s Jan. 6 win over
Miami, when former team scoring leader
Gina Montesano was lost for the season to
a knee injury. Howard’s been averaging
17 points and eight rebounds per contest
since then.

As a team, Pitt was held to two points

below their season average of 61 by the

Eagles’ defense. Led by Cal Bouchard’s
three steals and center Whitney Steele’s
two blocks and a steal, Boston College’s
defense forced Pitt to turn over the ball 20
times, including 10 steals by BC, and
comrrritted only 12 fouls. Pitt was put to
the free-throw line nine times, connecting
on a mere four attempts.

Boston College’s offensive game was
a balanced inside—outside attack. Forward
Holly Porter paced the Eagles with 19

 

points and seven rebounds, including four
offensive boards. Starting guards
Bouchard and Alissa Murphy combined
for 17 points and seven assists. Mandy
West and Paula Basco added 11 and 13
points, respectively, off the bench.

Pitt’s offensive attack was quite lirnit—
ed, though. Howard, Melissa Thompson,
and Michelle Katkowski lit up the score-
board for 44 points, 75 percent of the
team’s scoring. This has been a continu-
ing trend for the Panthers — since the loss
of Montesano, the trio has contributed
close to 50 percent of the scoring. Pitt is
1-9 when scoring less than 60 points,
quite a problem for a team averaging only
61 points per contest.

The game was out of the Lady
Panthers’ hands not even 10 minutes into
it. With 12 minutes left in the first half,
Boston College already had built a 24-12
lead. The Eagles kept the rout up and
ended the half with a 44-27 lead, holding
Pitt to a .353 shooting percentage.

The largest lead of the game came
three minutes into the second half from a
Holly Porter basket that widened the gap
to 52-29. Over the next six minutes, Pitt
cut the lead down to 58-45, only to watch
Boston College score the garne’s next 11
points.

' Pitt’s ﬁnal game is this Tuesday at the
Field House against St. John’s. The game
begins at 7:30 p.m. The Panthers dropped
the season’s last road game Wednesday,
losing 103-71 to national power UConn.

 

Pitt tennis shows no Mercy

9‘ ‘Y.

   

Coming off their ﬁrst—ever wins at
the Pitt Invitational, the Lady Panther
tennis squad steamrolled Mercyhurst,
6-1, in a Friday non-league contest.

The Panthers won ﬁve of six sin-
gles matches, sweeping the bottom
three seedings with 6-0, 6-0 victories.
Alison Bucher, Beth Gang, and Pitt
Invitational winner Tamara Kalesnik
dispatched their opposition with little
difficulty.

Third seed Amanda Hoffman took
home a 6-1, 6-0 victory, while Erin
Shalbrack won the second-seed
matchup, 6-2, 6-0.

“They were competitive enough to
get us prepped for spring break,” said
Shalbrack of the Mercyhurst squad.
“[The win] helps our record a lot.”

Pitt’s only loss on the day came
from Fran Davis, who dropped the ﬁrst-
seed matchup.

The Panthers swept the event’s
three doubles matches, starting with
Davis and Shalbrack’s 8-3 win in the
ﬁrst-seed contest. The victory is the
team’s 13th of the season.

“We’ve been pulling off some real-

ly, really good wins,” said Shalbrack of
her team, the ﬁrst Pitt pair to take the
Pitt Invitational. “We can go really far.”

Shalbrack said that the Mercyhurst
pair “wasn’t much of a problem,” and
that tougher competition was on the
way later in the season from Big East
opponents West Virginia and
Georgetown. With some success
against the conference rivals, Davis and
Shalbrack may earn themselves an
International Tennis Association rank-
ing among East coast schools.

Kalesnik and Bucher teamed up at
second seed and earned an 8-0 shutout
over the Mercyhurst entry. Third-seed-
ed doubles squad Jen Bible and Diane
Mulligan took their match 8-3.

All three doubles victories counted
towards the Panther team’s six points.
Gang’s and Bucher’s wins in the low-
seeded singles contests were not used
for team scoring.

Friday’s action was the last for the
Lady Panthers before a three-match
swing through Florida over spring
break. The team returns home Mar. 14
and 15 for matches against Youngstown
State and Eastern Indiana. The two Cost
Center events will be the team’s first
home performances since October.

BC took a 47-46 lead on an Abrams lay-in.
However, Pitt would answer with a

~ Blount spinner in the lane and a Cummings
_ steal that resulted in a lay-up and a ﬁred—up

Field House crowd.
The Panthers tortured the Eagles down

‘ low for most of the afternoon with stiﬂing

defenses. Abrams was double—teamed by the
Panthers big men and was held to 16 points.

Boston College threatened to tie the
game again when 6-foot—9 center Mickey
Curley tried to throw down a two-handed
shot, but Blount stepped up and swatted it
away.

“That was huge. They don’t get any big-

‘ ger than that,” Willard said of Blormt’s rejec-

“Everybody knows I’m not a center,”

vcforwand Gerald Jordan said with a smile.

“Just knowing Mark will be there to block

the shot — that gives me a lot of conﬁ-

The Eagles eventually did tie the game,
but Cummings stepped up again. He hit a
three-pointer at 4:29 and then nailed a leaner

Do You Skip or Miss Periods
Due to Stress?

Researchers at Magee-Womens Hospital in Pitts-
burgh are conducting a study to determine if stress
causes women to miss their periods (menstrual
cycles). Eligible women must have only 4 or fewer
periods in a year, be between 18-35 years old and
a nonsmolcer. You will be compensated for your
time and inconvenience. Women with regular pe-
riods are also needed for the study. For more in-
formation, please call (412) 641-1602.
