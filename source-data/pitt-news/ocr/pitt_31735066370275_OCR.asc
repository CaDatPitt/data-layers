Presby doctors implant J arvik—7 heart

By Michelle Zollner
Staff Writer

Presbyterian—University Hospital’s
surgeons have implanted a 39-year-old
western Pennsylvanian man with the
Jarvik-7 artiﬁcial heart.

The patient, whose name and iden-
tity have been withheld at the family’s
request, developed heart problems in
July of 1985. He has been diagnosed
as having ischemic cardiopyopathy, a
deteriorating condition of the heart
muscle caused by hardening of the
artery.

Two weeks ago, the man suffered
cardiac arrest and was admitted to a

local hospital. The patient was stabiliz—
ed. However, his condition then began
deteriorating because of resulting em-
bolisms, blood clots and pulmonary
edema.

After consultation with Presby
surgeons, a decision was made that the
Jarvik-7 was the only option for the pa-
tient’s survival. He was transported
Sunday to Presby and then prepared for
the surgery.’ The doctors said they
welcomed the collaboration with the
other hospital.

Dr. Bartley Griffith, Dr. Robert
Hardesty and Dr. Alfredo Trento were
the surgeons who performed the
implantation.

Athletes take stand
against investments

By Kathy Stahl H
Staff Writer

At the Nov. 25 nationally televised
Pitt-St. John’s basketball ‘game, Pan-
ther players wore red, green and black
ribbons to protest Pitt’s investments in
companies that do business with the
Pretoria government in South "Africa.

“Pitt is the most televised basketball
team around,” said Rashid» Soundiata,
a member of Students for a Free South
Africa. “Getting the team players to
wear the ribbons has raised the divest-
ment issue. We’ve had feedback from
Philadelphia, New York and Massa-
chusetts — the whole East Coast is
fired up.” ' '

The three colors that constitute the
make-up of the ribbon are symbolic of
the colors of South Africa. Red stands
for blood, green for the land and black
for the people. Since 1984, when the
South African government imple-
mented a state’of emergency giving
total control to 4.3 million whites over
23 million blacks, there have been over
l,l00 people killed — the majority o
whom were black. ‘

Getting the basketball team to wear
the ribbons was a group effort from a
number of people. The idea began with
Donald Frazier, Tony Baldwin and
Soundiata. All three students belong to

Students for a Free South Africa and
Black Action Society.

“I had a dream that the basketball
players were leading cheers at halftime
for divestment,” said Frazier.

Frazier, Baldwin and Soundiata liked '

the idea of getting the basketball team
involved because of the national atten-
tion that they receive. They talked with
Keith Tinsley, the spokesman for
Athletes Against -Apartheid, who in
turn talked to basketball player Charles
Smith. Smith approached his team-
mates with the idea, and they, along

with Panther coach Roy Chipman,

agreed to wear the ribbons.

“Everyone on the team‘ supports
divestment," said Matt Miklasevich, a
Panther basketball player, “and as a
general consensus we all agreed to
wear the ribbons.

“I personally am for divestment,”
he continued, “but after all, we’re here

to play basketball, not to make a‘

political stand. Also, the ribbons were
only worn for the nationally televised
game. If we’re going to wear them,
then it should be at all the games.”

Baldwin said that he would like to see
the team wear the ribbons at all the
games but that it was up to the discre-
tion of the players.

ment of surgery in the division of car-
diothoracic surgery and an assistant
professor at the University of Pitts-
burgh School of Medicine. He is na-
tionally known for his research in car-
diac transplantation surgery. He recent-
ly led the surgical team at Presby that
performed a “piggyback” heart
transplant which involved inserting a
second heart to assist the old one in
pumping blood.

Hardesty is chief of cardiothoracic
surgery and an associate professor of
surgery atthe University of Pittsburgh

Trento is a member of the surgery
department and is an assistant professor

burgh School of Medicine. He is a
graduate of the University of Padua in
Padua, Italy.

This operation is the second use of
the Jarvik-7 artificial heart as an in-
terim life-saving device. The doctors
hope to find a human heart to replace
the Jarvik-7 in the near future.

They could not specify the exact date
of transplantation because they must re-
ly on the patient’s condition and also
the availability of a donor. The donor
might be difficult to ﬁnd due to the fact
that the patient has type 0 blood; but
the doctors were optimistic, they said
that “the media could help in the search
to find a compatible donor." ’

A WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 5, I986

The first Jarvik heart implant at‘.

Presby was completed on Thomas
Gaidosh, 47, of Sutersville, Pa., on
Oct. 24, 1985.-Gaidosh recieved a
human heart four days later and was
discharged from the hospital 18 days
afterwards. Gaidosh has displayed an
excellent recovery to date. In a phone
conversation with The Pittsburgh
Press, he said, “I feel great. ”_He also
said that he would like to visit the

Jarvik-7 patient to assure him and his 4

family that they should have faith.

Doctors said that even if a human . I. - 

heart were available the day after the
surgery was performed, the transplant
could not take place. An indeterminate

was a strong statement,” said Baldwin,
“and I hope that the university realizes
how strongly we students feel about the
issue.” _

Soundiata feels that the administra-
tion will “probably not” change their
stand on divestment because of the
team wearing the ribbons.

“The board of trustees are people
who exploit others, and they are not go-
ing to be concerned with a basketball
team," said Soundiata. “There are
over 20 universities that have divested,

and it has been proven that the highest
case of loss experienced by any of them
was less than one percent. I would like
to see evidence from the board that
divestment would financially hurt the
university, and how much.”

Tinsley has already started a petition _

with the signatures of 130 athletes to
protest Pitt’s investment, and he feels
that the involvment of the entire stu-
dent body is going to increase.

attention,” Tinsley’ said. “We just

Pan-Africanism, according to Kwame

Toure of the All-African Peoples’

Revolutionary Party. Toure is known
to many as the black power activist of
the 19605, Stokley Carmichael.
Toure is now a member of the cen-
tral committee of AAPRP, and he
spoke last Monday night as part of the
Black Action Society’s celebration of
Black History Month.
“Pan-Africanism is the total libera-
tion and uniﬁcation of Africa under
scientific socialism, ” Toure explained.

1 . .

I Under Pan-Africanism, all the coun-

tries of the African continent would
become united under a socialist govem—
ment. The AAPRP seeks to accomplish
their goal through the organization of
people of African descent all over the
world, the “diaspora.”

“Pan-Africanism as a sentiment
among black people in this world is
very strong,” said BAS Political Ac-
tion Committee chaimian Rashid Soun-
diata. “Not everybody, but many peo-
ple, see black unity as the only way to
solve the problems blacks face in this
world-, because from the Pan-
Africanists’ perspective, when you
look, at who is suffering in the world
the most, black people are always at the
bottomof the socio-economic ladder,”
Soundiata said.

Tangential to the goal of Pan-
Africanism is the elimination of
American and European imperialism
around the world, according to Toure.
“We seek the active destruction of
American imperialism,” he said, call-
ing the United States “a filthy coun-
try.”

A primary theme of Toure’s message
was the need for organization among
the African people ofthe world. “Our

capitalism, which he called “a satanic
system.” According to Toure, the
capitalist system forces people to live
like animals by implementing a soci-
ety “of survival of the fittest.”

“-A man should not strive for his own
advancement, but for the advancement
of all his people,” Toure declaimed.

Toure called for the black members
of the audience to join the AAPRP,
which accepts as members only those
of African descent.  '

Soundiata explained that Toure was

No policy

By Michael Ashford
Assistant News Editor

At 8 p.m. last night. President
Reagan presented his State of the Union
address to both houses of Congress
after one week's delay in response to
the space shuttle catastrophe last
Tuesday.

Reagan opened his address with a
positive assessment of the economy,
citing figures that show inflation hav-
ing dropped from 12 percent to four
percent since 1980, lower interest rates
and constant growth — without refer-

~ ring to real growth rates.

“Family and community,” Reagan
said, “are the costars . of this great
American comeback.”

The policy proposals Reagan allud-
ed to or explicitly stated were in accor-
dance with administration policy since
Reagan took office. Urging the nation
in an effort to “break free from failed
policies,” Reagan called for a redeﬁni-
tion of social policy “to create a lad-
der of opportunity to full employment
so that all Americans can climb to
economic power and justice on their
own." ‘

In reference to potential budget cuts
under the Gramm—Rudman Act,
Reagan declared that taxes would not
be raised. He said that such tax in-
creases would burden the poor work-
ing family.

change

."Let‘s reduce the federal budget and
leave-the family budget alone.” Reagan
said.

In addition. Reagan called upon Con-
gress to grant him a line item veto and
said,“I'll take the heat."He also urg-
ed the passage of a balanced budget
amendment to the Constitution.

“The most powerful force we can
enlist against the federal deficit is an
ever-expanding American economy,
unfettered and free,” Reagan said in
calling for the passage of tax reform
which would limit the personal rate to
35 percent and raise personal exemp-
tions to $2,000.

Reagan appointed the White House
Domestic Council to research new
policies for the poor, while quoting
Franklin Roosevelt as having said,
“Welfare is a narcotic, a subtle
destroyer of human spirit.” Secretary
of Health and Human Services Otis
Browen is also to develop a private-
sector insurance for the catastrophically
ill.

As concerns social policy, Reagan
pledged to continue efforts to legalize
prayer in" school and to illegalize
abortion.

At the same time, Reagan promised
to “hold ‘real growth in defense spend-
ing to a bare minimum," yet promis-
ed the “freedom fighters” of the world
continued material support in direct
allusion to the Nicaraguan contras.

Libyan jet forced down

  

.,-_..V I Israel — Israel confirmed that its
warplanes intercepted and forced a
private Libyan executive jet to land in
Northern Israel yesterday. Israeli radio
said the plane was ﬂying over the
Mediterranean to Syria from Tripoli,
Libya. and left Israel after a five—hour
detention at an Israeli military base. In
addition to the crew, there were nine
Syrian politicians aboard. No shots
were ﬁred during the interception of the
jet by" Israeli warplanes over Cyprus.
Israel said it took the action because of

_ the belief that “persons involved in
‘planning an attack against Israel" were
aboard.

Bomb defused in
Eiffel Tower

PARIS — A spokesman said police
found and defused a bomb that was
high on the Eiffel Tower in Paris, just
blocks from where another bomb went
off outside a luxury clothing store and
injured eight people. Security guards
evacuated the popular Eiffel Tower
Monday night when the bomb was
found. The spokesman said the bomb
had been set for 1 a.m. — one hour
after the tower closes.

Fighting continues
across Green Line

Lebanon — Lebanese troops and
Christian militiamen fought with tanks
and heavy machine guns across
Beirut’s Green Line yesterday. The
heaviest ﬁghting in several weeks along

the Green Line came amid tightened
security in East Beirut in the wake of
a bomb attack which killed as many as
nine people. Military sources said the
fighting in Lebanon’s capital was ac-
companied by similar clashes on the
_ hills overlooking Beirut. Dozens of
shells crashed into densely populated
Christian and Moslem residential
neighborhoods on both sides of the

P: Green Line-.

The escalation of violence triggered
fears of an all-out return to civil war.
There has been a two—week deadlock
in factional communications accom-
panied by Moslem militiacalls for the
resignation of President Gemayel. The
situation was further complicated by
reports that Syria, which backs the
Moslem camp, has no intention of stop-
ping military action by the anti-
Gemayel forces. Syr_ia’s vice president
was quoted as telling a Christian
parliamentary delegation that Syria will

not undertake any military action but

cannot stop others from resorting to

military action.
Soviets to begin

nuclear test bans

GENEVA ~— The Soviet Union
challenged the United States to begin
negotiations on banning all nuclear
tests. The Soviets took the initiative at
the opening of the 1986 session of the
40-nation disarmament conference be-
ing held in Geneva, Switzerland. A

Soviet delegate said the United States :

should “confirm. in deeds" its declared
commitment to ridding the world of
nuclear weapons.

Search continues

for shuttle wreck

CAPE CANAVERAL — The Coast
Guard scaled back the search of the
surface of the Atlantic Ocean for the
wreckage‘ of the Challenger. The
search for pieces of the shuttle is turn-
ing to the ocean floor today. NASA is
trying to recover 17 objects from the

bottom of the Atlantic that might be
fragments of the spacecraft. Two other
large items spotted on the bottom turned
out to be a helicopter and a light
airplane.

Lawmakers protest

South Africa — Some_30 mixed-race
lawmakers staged a sit—in for a second
straight day at a dining room reserved
for members of the white House
Assembly. Waiters denied service to

‘the lawmakers, who are attempting to

integrate the parliamentary restaurant.
A white opposition legislator refused
to eat his own meal when waiters
declined to serve the mixed-race
lawmakers. Calling the incident “a
disgrace,” he said he would boycott the
parliamentary room until it was
integrated.

of the author and not of The Pitt News staff.

Gay Rights  

It seems likely that a homosexual rights _bill,

similar to those already passed in 75 American com-
munities, including the state of Wisconsin, -will soon

be passed by the New York City Council. What
makes these bills significant is that they are impor-
tant first steps toward ensuring the protection of
homosexuals from unfair discrimination in the work
place. _ '

Opponents of this bill in New York City contend

, that it, in effect, legalizes sodomy, that it will fur-

ther undermine the rotten, decaying foundation on
which America’s morals rest and that it will en-
courage and give license to homosexual
schoolteachers and others working with our children
to seduce and sodomize our young and otherwise
defile their innocent persons. Such ignorant,
backward thinking is typical of those individuals too

v- fearful to face what they cannot understand.

The bill under consideration in no way sanctions

‘or advocates homosexuality. What it does is to pro-

vide a largely misunderstood segment of our society
with the assurance that they cannot be denied a job
because of their private sexual practices. Moreover,
the bill does nothing to set employment quotas,
therefore, the rights of employers are not trampled
upon; it merely stipulates that qualified individuals,
whether homosexual or heterosexual, will receive
equal treatment and consideration . when seeking

A _ employment. This strikes the fair—minded as a large-

ly equitable measure.

One would hope that the adoption of these bills
will set precedents for other communities to do
likewise. Further, one might hope that the city coun-
cil of Pittsburgh would take" such a measure into
consideration. It would be folly to allow ourselves
to be bamboozled by the squeamish, sanctimonious
moralists who spew self-righteous, judgmental
bluster invoking the name of God, and evincing no
compassion for those individuals whose difference,
often regarded as aberration by sneering observers,
is already a sufficiently great burden. '

Divest Now

While white South Africans continue
to live better than anybody in the en-
tire world, over 1,400 of my brothers
and sisters lie buried in South African
soil! Why? Because they wanted
freedom! They wanted to vote! They
wanted to have a voice in the govern-
ing of their own country! They wanted
to provide proper, nourishment and
health services for their families! They
wanted to own their own lands! They
wanted to live with their families and
not be divided and relocated by the
white racist government which en-
slaved them! They wanted the chains
of bondage removed from their bodies
and minds! They wanted respect! They
wanted proper education! They wanted
dignity! They wanted to be treated like
human beings. not like brainless
animals!

Now you might be saying to yourself
that they wanted too much. too fast; but,
which of these liberties that you take

a day?

rush" (The Pitt News, Jan. 27, 1986).
After all,.aren’t all fraternities here at
Pitt just like the ones shown guzzling
beer, chasing women and getting
drunk? Yeah, right.

This could not be farther from the
truth. Here at Pitt the Greeks are well-
established and community oriented.
They have helped the community in
many ways: Greek Week. Sigma Chi
Derby Days, Fiji’s Brothers Against
Drunk Driving and others are com-
munity projects. Greek Week last year
raised $58,000 for Eye and Ear
Hospital. Greek Week is a time when
all the Greeks come together and raise
money for a good cause. Personally.
I think that is pretty impressive.

Even though a dry rush is being
pushed upon the Greeks by the ad-
ministration, it is not the first time the

Greek system has been forced to
change. In the '70s, fraternities were

made by the courts to stop hazing. At J

first people were against the change and
thought the system would be brought
down; but that hasn’t been the case. I
believe that a dry rush, while not cur-
rently popular, will eventually help and
strengthen the Greek system.

Brotherhood is learned during pledg-
ing, and it is not very easy; ask any
fraternity member and he will tell you
that no one just “booin“ becomes a
fraternity member after signing a bid.
There is a long process of pledging.

During pledging, there is only one 6‘

night a week when partying occurs.
The rest of the time is given to either
studying and other activities which help
broaden a person. Activities such as of-
fices in the fraternity. being a member
of Student Government Board and
many other campus—wide activities give
people experience in responsibility and
leadership.

Fraternities help to develop a well-
rounded person who is ready to step out
into the working world. Greeks take
with them friendships that last a
lifetime as well as leadership skills.

I chose to be in the Greek communi-
ty, as have many before me. It has
helped me to grow and mature. The
Greek system is strong at Pitt, and it

would take more than the loss of a tool ,

such as beer to harm it.

Ramblings From The

The Gaping Cavity Of Death

Re: history‘s most recent spectacle
of catastrophe: They blowed up. they
blowed up real good. Hey mama. I‘m
on the shuttle to doom and there just
ain't no room so don't bother to wait
up ‘cause I might not be home.

It reminds me of the time I saw an
autospy at the morgue downtown. The
stiff was a car crash victim. caucasian
female. approximately 30-32 years of
age. cause of death unknown.

This gore ritual gave me a strong
whiff of life and death at its cheapest.
I walked through the antiseptic room
with organs. limbs and fetuses in jars
of formaldehyde hovering strangely on
shelves above and below eye level. The
subject was lying in a contorted posi-
tion on the last table. Her chest cavity
was already exposed when I arrived.
and scrubbed medical vultures pro-

ceeded to cut and saw vital organs
which one would hold up to us. us be-
ing the class I was attending this
bloodfest with. and intone blandly
“liver.“ and then toss the organ onto
a meat scale and give a clipboard—toting
lackey the figures. Within minutes (ac-
tually after the first cut). I was suffi-
ciently numbed to the sight before me
to look as deeply and from every angle
possible into its chopped and dripping
innards. They continued to remove.
identify and weigh organs. stopping to
scoop up the intestines and random
minor guts and throw them into a
plastic garbage can.

Meanwhile. two other MEs (that‘s
Medical Examiners) went to work on
the head. To get to the brain. they pulled
the facial skin all the way over the head
making the woman‘s face resemble

those of the underground race in
“Beneath the Planet of the Apes“ —
all veins and blood and vague indenta-
tions where the eyes and mouth belong.
Then they whipped out the circular saw
and cut through the top of the skull.
And there it was. in all its grey. con-
voluted glory — the human brain. very
dead but quite impressive. It almost
dropped right out of the head. It seemed
like they just made a couple little snips
and out it came.

When the body was completely gut-
ted. I looked into it and saw just a
backbone surrounded by a pool of
blood. one or two inches deep. It would
have made a nice wading pool. Then
I noticed that the MEs were no longer
occupied with the body and were busy
tending to the organs and such. So I
reached out and touched the body’s

iWhere Have All The Good TimesGone?

For years I have envied the legen-
daiy Huckleberry Finn and his youthful
freedom. Here is a kid with few press-
ing responsibilities and all the time in
the world to float aimlessly down the
Mississippi River on a raft. And he
never had to face adulthood.

For that matter. I never wanted to
face adulthood. and I‘ve fought for
years to avoid growing up. However.
I‘ve never found the key to eternal
youthfulness and. well. I couldn‘t even
build myselfa raft. So I decided to try
my hand at growing up.

What should I do with my life?.That
is the troubling question that relentless-
ly nips at the heels of young people to-
day. Sure. we know we should gradu-
ate from high school. earn a college
degree. find a career that pays well. get

married. raise two—and—a-half children
then retire. Oh. and somewhere be-
tween the career and retirement we
should buy a house, a car and a family
dog. Then. I suppose life would be
fulfilled — right‘?

That's what I thought at first. The
way I figured it. one had to be a
businessman to make money. so I
entered Pitt’s business school. I would
then graduate from Pitt. work in a cor-
poration. make lots of money. make
even more money. then retire. I was
set for life — until I was confronted
with the harsh realities of calculus.
COBOL and accounting. Perhaps I
could do without the car and the dog

. and the business school.

Without further adieu I dropped out
the business school and right into the
lap of my wife. She helped me back up

on my feet. encouraged me to pursue
a career that I would enjoy and then
proceeded to buy me a dark suit.
yellow tie. wing—tipped shoes and a
briefcase.

I got the hint. and I told her. "Lisa.
this is all very nice. but I won‘t be
needing these things as a bum.“ She
wasn‘t amused.

“You‘ve got to get a goodjob." she
insisted. "You just have to be realistic
about life.“ I say phooey!

Thoroughly confused, I have taken
a step back to examine my interests.
talents and skills. I’ve found that I like
to write. sing. paint. hunt. camp. bake
and collect country antiques. My as—'
sessment is that I would make an ideal
game show contestant — but I‘m not
into jumping around and screaming.
And besides. I ‘m supposed to be grown

chalk-white arm. It was very cold.
Then I touched a beefy piece ofthe soft
white underbelly and licked my fingers.
A girl saw me do ‘this. put her hand
over her mouth and dashed from the
room quickly. Nausea of course is no
hinderance to the man who wishes to
taste death.

If my seemingly gruesome fondness
for death and its trappings seems
demented. it‘s nothing compared to
America‘s overwhelmingly pathologi-
cal fear of death. Most people are con-
tent to let the media give them their
much needed death fix. Inundated with
cop show mayhem. big screen disaster
mongering and the latest morbid litany
from some sphincter ofthe world like
Beirut. people think they”ve seen it all
and are numb to death. But when it
comes close to home. there is a pro-

up. Really.

Why must people sacrifice all their
interests for the sake of practicality
and. well. reality‘? What is so exciting
about working every day at a job you
hate so you can live the good life. work
late every night. come home. eat din-
ner. lounge on the sofa watching televi-
sion. then go to bed‘? All interests sud-
denly become pushed into the file that
is reserved for retirement.

Not that retirement is so terrible. but
at that point. things change. I won‘t
even have to collect antiques because
the furniture I had purchased while
working will undoubtedly fall into that
category automatically. By the time I
retire I will have become used to store-
hought cookies. so why bother baking‘?
And did you ever try to hunt with a
cane‘? As for my voice. well. George
Burns still sings.

soap operatic display of grief which
Reagan smeared all over the tube when
the astronauts blowed up.

In African tribal societies. it is a no-
no to cry over the dead because this im-
plies that their demise has imposed on
and interrupted life. While death often
seems like a disruption of life. it is real-
lyjust a part of it. a big part. The death
of that car crash victim enhanced my
life; and the explosion of the shuttle
enhanced the life of the sensation-
starved American public as well as
ABC. NBC. CBS and CNN. It inspired
me to write this and is now enriching
your lives. Cheer up. Wipe away your
tears. Wear black. cultivate a healthy
pallor and walk with death on your
side. It‘s the only wav to go.

Such a sacrifice of interests seems to
be the way of life for adults in today‘s
society. The pursuit of money is sup-
posed to supersede the pursuit of. shall
we say. happiness. Admittedly. money
can certainly have its benefits. but so
what.

You know. maybe growing up real-
ly isn‘t the answer. Perhaps those years
between childhood and retirement can
actually be fun. When pursuing a
career. more people should find a job
that makes them happy. one that
doesn‘t require major sacrifices.

Although I'm just as confused as
ever at this point. I feel relieved that.
just maybe. there really is life between
childhood and retirement. And who
knows. maybe someday I'll ﬁnd myself
on that raft — or at least a small boat
—— living carefree and maybe even hav-
ing fun.

Need for child care grows
 as work and family conflict

By Pam Marvich
Staff Writer

The structure of the American family
is changing. With the increasing
number of women in the work force.
along with the rising divorce rate. in-
flation and the rising number ofsingle
parents. the issue of child care has
become an increasingly urgent one.

According to a panel of labor. cor-
porate and academic leaders in a study
they conducted last month, “The ma-
jority of Americans are finding that
their work and family lives increasingly
come into conflict."

On one side, there is a growing
number of American employers that
have made an effort to help their
employees through different types of
child-care assistance —- from voucher
plans to discounts, and from child-care
options in benefit packages to corporate
child-care programs. More than 1,800
companies are now doing so, as com-
pared to 600 in 1982 — according to
a study conducted last year by the Con-
ference Board, a non-profit business
organization in New York.

Since affording child care has
become a problem for many employ-
ees, corporations are increasingly pro-
viding assistance, according to the
study.

The other side of the child-care issue,
however. is not so optimistic. Accor-
ding to the Family Policy Panel in a
study conducted last month, jobs in the
United States continue to be fashioned
as if the typical family was still com-
posed of a man in the workplace and
a wife at home with the children. On-
ly 10 percent of American families still
fall into this category.

“Most children today have a work-
ing mother,“ stated the report. Seventy
percent of the women with children
from six to 13, and about 50 percent
of women with children under three are
in the workforce. The panel conclud-
ed that the American workplace, as it
is inﬂuenced by the attitudes of govern-
ment and industry, has failed to adjust
to dramatic changes in the family
structure.

“Working parents are increasingly
unsure of how to balance the competing

   

pressures." wrote co—chairman John
Sweeny, president of the Service
Employees International Unions. and
Alice llchman. president of Sarah
Lawrence College. in their groups
I79-page report.

The report states that: "Major in-
stitutions in our country. from the
federal government to the workplace.
have not fully recognized or respond-
ed to these changes. Most industrial-
ized countries have implemented fami-
ly policies to accomodate the changing
economic and social environment. The
United States has not.”

As child care becomes a national
concern. it has grown to be an increas-
ingly important issue to the universi-
ty. College women. in particular. are
a target customer group for the child-
care business. _

In an age where traditional family
patterns have not changed. it is the
women who are expected to sacrifice
college or career plans where children

“Guilt is the one reason
we ’ve been so successful.
Working parents feel guilty
that they have to work, and
more guilty having to leave
their children in someone
else '5 care. ”

Perry Mandel
Founder of Kina'er—Care
Learning Centers

are involved. Also, with more women
re—entering the schooling system. the
availibility, cost and quality of child
care is of great importance.

The United States has provided day-
care services to its citizens for over 100
years. The establishment of New York
City’s Nursery for the Children of the
Poor in 1854 marked the beginning of
day care as we know it. The nursery’s
purpose was to assist poor families
through the provision of supplemental
day—care.

Through the years, day care has ex-
panded and the way in which cities and
companies are dealing with the issue

has evolved. The Depression and ear-
ly l940‘s brought a large growth in
day—care services, with the government
supporting such nurseries under the
Federal Emergency Relief Administra-
tion and the Works Progress Ad-
ministration programs.

National recognition of the need for
day-care services remained at a stand-
still until the passage of the 1962
amendment to the Social Security Act.
It authorized federal grants—in—aid to
state public welfare agencies for day-
care services, thus encouraging states
to improve standards for day—care facil-
ities and to develop broader day—care
plans.

Basically, there are four categories
under which day care falls. The first
is private day care. which is not fund-
ed by state, local or federal govern-
ment. This is usually a more flexible
type of care, since there is no minimum
enrollment to keep federal funding.
The child—teacher ratio in a private set-
ting is usually low, although the cost
of the care is quite high and is based
on the number of hours, days or weeks
a child attends the center.

Some day—care centers operate on a
sliding fee scale. where cost is depen-
dent upon the amount of income com-
ing into the home of the child. Fee
scales vary, with some centers incor-
porating a scale that slides to zero while
others have a minimum base fee which
everyone must pay.

A variation of the sliding feelscale
program is the Four P’s Program —
Pennsylvania Pilot Providers Project —
a state—funded program to help mothers
pay for day care. Assistance from the
program is based upon need (i.e.,
women who have to work will receive
aid before women who are attending
college). To acquire help from the Four
P’s funded program one must first
secure a placement for their child in a
Four P’s funded center. After applica-
tion they are placed on a waiting list
within that center to receive funding.
Four P’s grant aid is based on an in-

come scale. and because of the way it‘s '

set up, most single parents get a full
grant for care. Once the child is placed
in the center, it may take some time for
a Four P’s opening to become availa-

ble. and until that time you must pay
the fee yourself.

Institutional day care takes two main

forms, which are generally referred to
as "centers" and “home care.
Centers look after large numbers of
children and often have elaborate
facilities. Some are commercial opera-
tions; the three biggest chains are La
Petite Academies, Children’s World
Inc. and Kindercare. Other centers are
non-profit operations run by civic
groups. employers, labor unions or
churches.

Home care is usually offered in
private houses, sometimes by child-
care professionals and sometimes by
unskilled mothers who want to earn ex-
tra dollars. Home—care facilities may
or may not be licensed by the state. and
are usually limited to less that 10
children.

“Guilt is the one reason we’ve been
so successful,” said Perry Mandel, the
reigning king of day-care—for-profit. In
September of ’84, he told Newsweek,
“Working parents feel guilty that they
have to work. and more guilty about
having to leave their children in some-
one else‘s care." To some people,
Mandel’s 900 Kindercare learning
centers resemble fast—food establish-
ments, with their clean, well—lit rooms
and red tile roofs. Currently, the chain
handles about 100.000 "units" (chil-
dren) in 42 states.

The question of what to do with
America’s children is an ever-
increasing problem. Estimates show
that nearly five million American
children under the age of 10 have no
one to look after them when they come
home from school. Studies also show
that nearly 500,000 preschoolers under
the age of six are in the same predica-
ment. Today, most parents of young
children work outside the home. Two-
job couples have become the rule rather
than the exception, and according to
U.S. Census statistics. the number of
single parents has doubled in the past
decade. Many parents. because of
relocating in order to find work. have
no friends or relatives they can rely on
to watch their children and therefore
must depend on some type of day care.

Advocates of day care insist that in
a well—run center. children benefit more
from day care than they do from stay-

a.

ing home. In a recent Newsweek arti-
cle. Carol Jones. who runs a 220—unit
Kindercare in southeast Atlanta, said.
"You can see all the difference in the
world between a child who has been in
a quality day—care program and one
who hasn’t. Most four-year—olds who
haven’t been in child-care programs
can’t do all the things our older two-
year-olds can do."

Nancy Finnessy agrees. She has her
two-year—old son Scott enrolled in a
Mother Goose day—care center in
Orlando, Fla. “Everyday when Scott
comes home. he shows me the artwork
he’s made at Mother Goose, and sings
the songs he’s learned — he's always
singingl! He seems more social than a
lot of the neighborhood children who
aren’t involved with day care; he seems
to make friends easier [and is] more
willing to share.”

Day—care experiences seem to help
children deal better and feel more com-
fortable in group situations early on —
almost like “knowing the rules of the
game before they get to elementary
school."

There are some people who don't
agree with this notion ofday care. Dr.
Burton White, the director ofBoston’s
Center for Parent Education. feels
children need large doses of “custom-
made love.“ White. has no patience
with the- idea that families need two
paychecks these days to get by. He told
Newsweek. “That's a typical middle-
class statement. Both parents don’t
have to work — they both want to work
to maintain a house or a lifestyle. They
put their desires above the welfare of
the baby."

Another criticism of day-care centers
is that they are breeding grounds for
disease. Dr. Gary Stanlan of Children's
Hospital in Philadelphia. said studies
have found day—care centers to be a ma-
jor source of hepatitis. Children tend
to pass colds along with their toys, in-
cluding other infectious bacteria that
cause meningitis and giardiasis, a sever
form of diarrhea. Health department
officials claim that proper hygiene can
alleviate such problems. and also that
exposure to other children helps tod-
dlers build up their immunity to disease
before they enter elementary school.

P.a'g'e.8 '. . .

PMS confronted finally...

By Nancy Quick
Staff Writer

I'm experiencing uncomfortable anx-
iety today — it started this morning. I
woke up feeling extremely bloated.
especially my face. My head felt six
sizes too big and my sinuses were
stuffed up — it was as if someone had
wrapped a giant wad of cotton around
my head. I figured I was catching the
ﬂu. Everybody has the flu these days.

But then a really strange thing hap-
pened. I became suddenly enraged
because neither one of my parents had
change for the parking meter for my
trip in to Oakland. I was staring at the
dimes and nickels in my father‘s open

hand. laughing with him. Plenty of

change but nothing to fit in the slot.
Then all ofa sudden this wave of anger
swelled up inside of me. It carried me
right out of the kitchen and slammed
the door behind me. Feelings of anger
and frustration and pain intensified. I
stormed out of the house. Then I found
myself standing in the middle of the
garage. having forgotten my car keys
and locked myself out of the house.
"I’ll never find a goddainned place to
park in Oakland anyway!“ I screamed.
Then. as if from outside myself. I
looked at what I was doing and
wondered what was wrong with me.
Mom said the cosmos was out of
whack because of that minor earth-
quake in Ohio. I don’t know. My
period's due in a week or so. Maybe
it’s PMS.

cramps. the discomfort of childbearing
and labor pain. postpartum anxiety and
depression. For centuries these symp-
toms have been regarded as the unfor-
tunate consequences of being the
childbearing sex. The Curse of Eve.
And until recently. a female was ex-
pected to suffer some pain associated
with menstruation and childbearing.
It's part of being a woman.

Part of being a woman means that 40
percent of women today suffer physical
and emotional stress symptoms
associated with a hormonal disorder
called Premenstrual Syndrome. accor-
ding to the estimates of Dr. Katharina
Dalton. a leading expert on PMS. The
disorder is not associated with
menstrual cramps or menstruation
itself. and 60 percent of women do not
suffer from it at all. Yet for 10 percent
of those who do suffer. PMS is severe

enough to cause serious disruption of

their personal and professional lives.

According to a recent article pub-
lished in The Wall Street Jourmil on
premenstrual distress, PMS triggered
bouts of uncontrollable trembling and
memory loss in one woman’s case,
caused severe abdominal cramps,
fatigue and depression in another.
Dalton‘s studies show that PMS costs
U.S. industry eight percent of its total
wage bill.

PMS has become a popular topic
among women today. According to
Connie McCarthy. program assistant
for the St. Francis PMS Clinic in Pitts-
burgh. 75 percent of college women
have it or think they have it.

"Young women are experiencing
physical and emotional trouble before
their periods begin.” said McCarthy.

“The pressures during finals week.
those associated with meeting
deadlines, and other academic and
social pressures can seem overwhelm-
ing and out of proportion to the women
suffering from PMS."

Not all women with PMS suffer
severe symptoms during the weeks
before menstruation begins, so it is not
unusual for them to go on for years.
withstanding monthly discomfort and
never connecting it to their menstrual
cycles. Menstrual problems are
generally associated with the menstrual
flow itself. but symptoms of PMS can
occur two weeks before the beginning
of a period or one week after its end.
That means that some women are suf-
fering physical and emotional pain.
sometimes great physical and emo-
tional pain. three weeks out of every
month. During the remaining week of
every month. they are menstruating.

WHAT IT IS
“It is not true that life is one damn
thing after another — it '5 one damn
thing over and over. "

— Edna St. Vincciit MI//(l_\'

Premenstrual Syndrome is a
physical. not a psychological condition.
a complex hormonal disorder thought
to be linked to the cyclical activity of
the hypothalamic —— pituitary —— ovarin
axis. Symptoms are both psychological
and physical. and can be specifically
attributed to PMS if they occur regular-
ly at the same phase of each menstrual
cycle and are followed by a symptom-
free phase each month. Symptoms in-
clude: abdominal bloating and cramp-
ing. accident proneness, anxiety, ‘back

pain. fatigue, irritability, suicidal
thoughts. sweet cravings. nasal conges-
tion and withdrawal from others.
McCarthy said. “Symptoms of PMS
cross so many lines. are applicable to

-many different psychological disorders.

But by the time a woman contacts us
[at the St. Francis PMS Clinic]. she has
already noticed a pattern in the recur-
rence of her symptoms associated with
her menstrual cycle. It is this pattern
that constitutes the main criteria for
diagnosis of PMS."

WHAT IT ISN’T
“But it is always i'izterest1'ng wlieii
one doesn’t see. If you don ’t see
what a thing means, you must be
lookiizg at it the wrong way round. "
— Agatha C/’H‘1'.8‘II'(’
In 1931, the PMS disorder was first
described in a paper by Dr. Robert

Frank. Today, it is difficult to find a
doctor who will treat a PMS diagnosis
seriously.

According to Dr. Ronald V. Norris
and Colleen Sullivan. authors of
"PMS,“ the medical community is vir-
tually ignorant of the diagnosis and
treatment for Premenstrual Syndrome.

“Today medical-textbooks ignore or
barely mention the syndrome and its
multiplicity of syndromes." said Nor-
ris. “As a result. most physicians —
male doctors who haven’t studied PMS
in medical school and never ex-
perienced a menstrual cycle — either
dismiss it as a psychosomatic
phenomenon or misdiagnose it."

Yet, more than 100 research studies
on PMS and cyclic disorders related to
menstruation have been published over
the years. proving that the condition
does. in fact, exist.

Women with PMS often seek help
from social service agencies and
fellowship programs in an attempt to
treat the symptoms of an undetected
PMS disorder. According to the find-
ings of PMS Action, a non—profit
counseling organization in Madison,
Wis.. these women are in Alcoholics
Anonymous because ofdrinking prob-
lems, in Overeaters Anonymous
because of PMS—related food binges,
or in bulimic clinics. Therapists treat
women who suffer psychological
trauma and yet are unaware of its
cause.

Diana joined Overeaters Anonymous
in an attempt to ﬁnd a solution to PMS-
related food binges. It was only later
that she made the connection between
her eating patterns and her menstrual
cycle and started working with the St.
Francis PMS Clinic.

1960

“Not everyone was willing to accept
it," she said. “They told me I wasjust
using PMS as an excuse to eat."

WHAT TO DO
“Oar .s‘tLicl1'es at Harvard suggest
that the average plzysieian knows a
little more about nutrition tlzan the
average secretary zuzless tlze
seei'etar_\' has a weight problem.
Then she probabl)‘ knows more than
the average [)li_\‘.8'f('l(lII. ”

— Jean Mayer, M. D.

At the St. Francis PMS Clinic, treat-
ment begins with a three—hour orienta-
tion meeting explaining the program.
McCarthy describes the orientation as
a kind of screening.

“The treatment is tough," she said.
“The women have a lot of things to do.
The orientation serves as a screening

LQELI J '

...as myth becomes reality

process, singling out those who are
really seeking help. Many don’t need
further medical treatment after the
orientation. They learn about the
disorder, take our suggestions on diet
and exercise, and PMS.“ said McCar-
thy. "Optivite contains a balance of a
number of vitamins and minerals, par-
ticularly the B—complex and
magnesium, which we have found to
be very effective for treating PMS
symptoms.”

Exercise is also prescribed. Recent
studies have shown a connection be-
tween the body’s production of en-
domorphins and its threshold for pain.
Practical observation proves that exer-
cise helps to reduce the symptoms of
PMS in most women.

“All of these prescriptions constitute
lifestyle changes," said McCarthy.
“It’s going to take a number of months
for a woman’s body to adjust."

If basic changes in lifestyle are not
enough, and a woman still suffers the
primary psychological or physical
distress symptoms after the first part
of her treatment, she undergoes pro-
gesterone therapy.

Progesterone is one of the two main
female hormones, produced during the
second half of the menstrual cycle —
from ovulation on — and in large
amounts during pregnancy. According
to Da1ton’s findings, a progesterone
deficiency causes PMS. The connec-
tion was made because so many women
suffering from both physical and
psychological complaints responded
positively to progesterone therapy.

Although progesterone therapy is a
proven effective treatmeni for PMS,
acquiring the hormone in its natural

form can be difficult. Doctors tend to
be uninformed about the uses of pro-
gesterone because of their relative ig-
norance of PMS. And because pro-
gesterone suppositories are not mass-
produced in the United States, phar-
maceutical salespeople aren’t inform-
ing doctors of its availability, as they
do with many other drugs. A further
obstacle is the confusion that exists be-
tween natural progesterone and syn-
thetic progestogens.

For years, physicians have been us-
ing synthetic progestogens as a less ex-
pensive substitute for progesterone.
Originally, researchers believed that
the two were interchangeable, and syn-
thetic progestogens began to be
marketed as “Progesterone.” More re-
cent studies show a significent dif-
ference between natural progesterone
and synthetic progestogens, particular-
ly in the treatment of PMS. While pro-
gesterone therapy is extremely effec-
tive, synthetic progestogens are of no
value as a treatment for PMS. In fact,
according to Dalton, synthetic pro-
gestogens (which are found in the con-
traceptive pill) usually make the syn-

‘ drome worse.

Although natural progesterone sup-

positories have been widely prescribed _

and used in France and England as a
treatment for PMS, they have not yet
been approved by the FDA here in the
United States. According to PMS
Action, the causes are economic as well
as social. In order to receive FDA ap-
proval, the company manufacturing
progesterone would have to conduct
extremely expensive “double—blind
studies” proving the effectiveness of
progesterone for the treatment of PMS.

Most drug companies are willing to
spend the money for the studies as long
as they can obtain long-term patent
rights to the drug they are testing. The
patent rights for the process of extrac-
ting progesterone ran out 20 years ago.
No company would therefore be able
to manufacture the drug exclusively, so
no company is particularly anxious to
assume the costs of the double—blind
studies. '

NOW THAT YOU KNOW
“It '3‘ sort oflike a roller Coaster to
hell. ”

— David Letterman on PMS

The Curse of Eve. The grossly
misunderstood phenomenon that
separates females from males.
Whatever one may call it,
Premenstrual Syndrome is a treatable
physical disorder that need not be suf-
fered by women just because they are
women. Symptoms of PMS leave
women feeling weak, negative and
vulnerable. The disorder causes them
to doubt themselves, and prevents them
from seeking the help they need.

“The most damage done is to a
woman’s self—esteem," said McCar-
thy. "If she suffers from PMS and ar-
ticulates that suffering, she is labeled
a weak human being. I believe just the
opposite. Women who have suffered
with PMS are the most extraordinary
copers in the world. They know like
clockwork they‘re going to fall apart
every month, and they live through that
for years until it gets too bad.”

Untreated women will continue to
suffer the emotional and physical pain
associated with PMS. But they need
not accept that suffering as inevitable.

Child abuse at day—care centers is
also a worry of parents. Within the last
five years, horror stories of day—care
centers that were run by child molesters
and former sex offenders have been
revealed. In fact, though, more
children are sexually abused in their
own homes by relatives or friends. than
in day—care centers or anywhere else
(Newsweek. May 14. 1984). In May
of ‘83. Senator Paula Hawkins of
Florida stressed that child abuse is
"society’s problem, not that of day
care." It was then that she publieally
described how she. herself, was
molested as a child.

Here at the University of Pittsburgh,
there are three types of day care which
are offered to students. faculty and
staff. Each center is affiliated with the
university. but is also open to the
general public.

The newest addition to Pitt’s child-
care facilities is the University Child
Development Center, located at 315
Bellefield Avenue. The center, which
opened in August of ’84, is run by Dr.
Jerlean Daniel and her staff oftrained
professionals. According to Dr. Dan-
iel, “You can‘t run a center with
volunteers.”

The Child Development Center has
an enrollment of approximately lO0
children ranging in age from six weeks
to nine years. The center is open daily
from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. for both part-
time and full-time care. Parents can
enroll their children anytime, and are
invited to stop by the center and see
how it operates. There is no Pitt dis-
count, nor is there a discount for sib-
lings. Parents pay for the day care on
a monthly basis, though fees do vary
for part—time and full-time care.

At the center. the teaching staff
prepares various activites for the dif-
ferent age groups. The environment
helps the children practice previously
learned skills, while helping them
develop new cognitive. psychosocial
and motor skills.

According to Cynthia Vanda, assis-
tant to the provost here at Pitt. the
Child Development Center was opened
because of the need for “adequate and
reasonably—prieed child care for the
university students. staff and faculty."
The Provost’s Advisory Committee on
Women’s Concerns keeps pressure on

the administration to provide scholar-
ships for the people who run the
centers. Many centers throughout the
city of Pittsburgh provide grants to
low—income people who are working or
are in training programs. Many such
programs are headed by the Urban
League.

Vanda said that many parents are
very excited about the new center.
"I‘ve heard very. very good reports
about it — people are happy with the
staff and the space. The Cathedral lawn
is the kids‘ playground; the only prob-
lem is that they have to cross the street
to get to it."

The final option affiliated with the
university, and the oldest of the three,
is the campus nursery — which has
been around for nearly 15 years. Ac-
cording to Vanda, the nursery resulted
from pressure by the Chancellor’s Ad-
visory Committee on Women’s Ser-
vices to provide some type of afford-
able child care to students and staff.
When the nursery originally opened.
the university provided a subsidy, and
the remaining funds came from tuition.
It always operated under the School of
Education, which employed trained
staff, along with student interns. When
the administration changed though, the
nursery came under the direction of the
Falk School, and is now headed by Dr.
Barb Murphy. The nursery is located
at the top of the stadium hill, by the
Veterans’ Administration Hospital.

As observed, the quest for affordable
and dependable day care is unending.
It seems there will always be parents
who have to work. and along with these
come children who must be cared for.
Joan Emerson. a San Francisco coun-
selor who helps families place their
children in day care. told Newsweek.
"Parents tend to be desperate, and that
is the basic thing that leads to low-
quality care and child abuse.” In any
case, day—care is not a substitution for
the love and attention of the natural
parents. You can’t buy that. But
nowadays, it seems that parents are
paying more attention to where and
with whom they leave their children.
No longer is the only. question, "Is
there enough room and how much does
it cost?” Finally, in a country that
depends on day care so heavily parents
are asking, "What are you going to do
with my child?”

When the center was being planned,
a committee was put together com-
prised of students, staff and faculty, to
decide what the center would include.
They put together a proposal for tradi-
tional child care. and though the center
that evolved was different than the pro-
posal, the proposal laid the foundation.
The university said that the center must
pay for itself. so when Dr. Daniel plans
the budget —— the cost of staff, equip-
ment, meals and special programs —
she must make sure the tuition covers
the debts. When examined, the prices
are comparable to other centers in the
area.

According to Vanda, Dr. Daniels
had been in charge of the child—care
center at Carlow College before com-
ing to Pitt. “The Carlow program sort
of moved to Pitt," she said. “When
their center closed, Jerry brought with
her most of her staff and a lot of the
children.”

Another option for students and
faculty is the Matilda Theiss Center,
also known as the Day Care/Child
Development Center. This center has
a contract with the government to pro-
vide subsidized child care, and is only
open to those people who qualify for
benefits under Title XX of the Social
Security Act.

To be eligible for assistance under
this act, parents must be enrolled in a
certain vocational program, or if they
are students, they must work at least
20 hours a week —— among other things.
The cost of the care is on a sliding fee
scale. and at present, there are 109
children — ages six weeks to six years
— enrolled in the program. The center
offers both institutional and home care.

According to Dr. Frank Jones. direc-
tor of the center. only about 25 percent
of the parents that have their children
enrolled in the center are affiliated in
some way with Pitt. Thecenter is open
from 7:30 a.m. - 5:30 p.m., Monday
thru Friday, and is located at 753 Bur-
rows Street, near the Terrace Village
housing project. Dr. Jones said,
"Though Dr. Daniel (of the Universi-
ty Child Development Center) and I
belong to the same professional
organization and we collaborate with
each other, our programs are very dif-
ferent. There is really no comparison
between the two.”

The Pitt News, February 5, 1986

By John Enright
Staff Writer

The Lady Panthers won their second
straight game Monday night. defeating
the Robert Morris Colonials 69-61 at
the new Sewall Center in Coraopolis.
The win marked the first time the Lady
Panthers have won consecutive games
since the first week of January when
they defeated Georgetown and Seton
Hall.

Pitt improved its record to 9-10 while
Robert Morris fell to 10-10.

The game was tied at halftime 28-28.
In the second half. Pitt took command
of the game. Head coach Kirk Bruce
explained how. “In the second half. we
got it in gear." said Bruce. “We got
the ball inside on them and we fouled
out two of their big girls."

The key factor in the game was the
foul shooting. Pitt went to the line on-
ly 15 times compared to the Colonials
31 attempts. But the Lady Panthers
were able to convert from the foul line
while Robert Morris wasn't. Pitt shot
87 percent (13 of 15) while the Colo-
nials struggled at 61 percent (19 of3 1).

In terms of the foul situation. the
Lady Panthers did an outstanding job.
"It‘s very frustrating when the of-
ficiating isn't up to par. but we did
what it takes to win." added Bruce.

Once again. Pitt was led in scoring
by Kim Gannis. Gannis. who scored 19
points. has led the Lady Panthers in
scoring 1 1 out of 20 games this season.

Thoug

Thoughts that are worth pondering

on a rainy day in Oakland:

0 Has anyone out there wondered if
Pitt basketball coach Roy Chipman
would be around next season had he not
resigned in December‘? This was to be
the year Pitt would make strides from
the middle of the pack in the Big East
and surge to the upper echelon. The
Panthers are currently a disappointing
4-5 in the league. having lost two con-
secutive home games. the latter at the
hands of the Least of the Big East —
Seton Hall.

0 When the Chipman era ends. will
he be remembered as a great recruiter?
It seems to me that once upon a time.
a not-so-popular Pitt football coach left
with the label of good recruiter.

0 Why hasn‘t freshman point guard
Mike Goodson been given a shot?
Goodson has looked impressive in the
few times I‘ve seen him in practice. He
is the true point guard that Pitt lacks.
With Joey David graduating this year.
Goodson will probably start the next
three years for the Panthers.

0 The quote of the year thus far came
from Pitt‘s backup center Tieo Cooper.
While in Cincinnati the morning of the
Pitt-Xavier game. Pitt assistant coach
Joe DeGregorio asked Cooper if he
slept well last night. Cooper‘s reply
was: “Yeah. man. I had 10 hours
sleep. I went to bed at midnight and
woke up at 8 a.m." Hmmm.

Sally Sheerer added 17 points and 11
rebounds while Kim Tirik chipped in
with 14 points and nine assists.

Robert Morris played the final two
minutes of the game with only four
players. and was led by Betsy Puskar
with 24 points. Lee Repasky added 16
points.

The Lady Panthers continue their
road trip tonight. travelling to Univer-
sity Park to play Penn State. The Lady
Lions are currently 15-4 overall and
9-1 in Atlantic 10 league play. Penn
State. is led in scoring by 6—2junior for-
ward Vicki Link. Link averages 13.3
points per game and 8.4 rebounds per
game.

Sophomore sensation Suzie McCon-
nell averages 12.6 ppg for the Lady
Lions. McConnell. who is from Pitts-
burgh’s Seton—LaSalle High School.
leads the nation in assists with 9.9 per
game.

"They’re always good," commented
Bruce. “They have a good bunch of
ballplayers and they play well together.
This is a good challenge for us. They
don’t make a lot of mistakes and
they're tough at home. Most teams are
confident at home. but I think this team
is especially confident at home."

It will take an exceptional perform-
ance by Pitt to pull off an upset tonight
and Bruce pointed out the key areas the
Lady Panthers will have to excel in:
“We don’t want to get in an up tempo
game. It’s just like any other game in
that we want to control the tempo. We
can‘t get turnover happy and lose our
confidence because they're such a good
team.“

tson

0 My vote for the next Pitt basketball
coach is Jim Satalin of Duquesne. He
is a good recruiter who knows the X’s
and O’s.

0 I have attended quite a few basket-
ball arena’s this season. and the Fitz-
gerald Field House. when it is rocking.
is the loudest. Syracuse’s Carrier
Dome can be deafening when the
33.000 fans are cheering. and the
19.000 locals in Louisville’s Freedom
Hall can produce a whale ofa roar. but
Fitzgerald is the king of noise.

0 Curtis Aiken is Pitt‘s most im-
proved player at this point in the

Randy Miller

season. His outside shooting has gone
from poor to great in just one season.
He is the single reason Pitt has won
four games in the Big East this year.
Without him. it would be an even
longer season.

0 Pitt will come back from the em-
barrassing loss to Seton Hall to finish
at 9-7 in the Big East. There is too
much talent on this team to finish any
VVOTSC.

0 Despite what some Pin News staff
writers believe. there‘s nothing I love
more than to see students intimidate

visiting players. I believe that’s just
another reason why college basketball
is so much better than the pros. The
student can actually be a critical part
of the game. By the way. I have yet to
attend a game at another school that has
students harass players like Pitt
(although I‘ve never attended a game
at Duke University, where the students
attack visiting players like a vampire
does blood). St. John’s Walter Berry
said he didn‘t hear the crowd chanting
“W—a—l-t—e—r“ when he touched the ball
in the first half. Right. Walter, that’s
why you shook your head and looked
at the crowd after missing shots early
in the game. Perhaps St. John’s Ron
Rowan didn’t hear the chant either. but
he did point at the Pitt student section
for at least 10 seconds after the Redmen
came from behind to beat the Panthers.

0 Walter Berry is by far the best
player in the conference. He gets his
25 points game in and game out despite
the fact that he is double- and triple-
teamed. He will be a great pro player
someday soon.

0 Pearl Washington is the most over-
rated player in the conference. True.
he is a good point guard and can make
the unbelievable pass. Butjust as often.
Washington will make a dumb play to
turn the ball over. He is exciting.
however.

0 I hope the Pitt fans verbally harass
Villanova’s Doug West more than
anyone. He accused a Pittalumni of of-

fering him megabucks to play basket-
ball here. Can you imagine a Pitt alum-
nus offering a player (who wouldn’t
even start) $10,000? If he was offered
money. do you suppose We$t received
a better offer or do you suppose he

turned the money down and said. “No
thank you Pitt. I‘ll play for Villanova
for free." Maybe We$t is just a nice,
honest boy from Altoona who grew up
telling the truth. Doug We$t and Abe
Lincoln. two of a kind. Sigh.

Villanova freshman Dia-
mond Doug West will make
his first appearance at Fitz-
gerald Field House on Friday
night.

West, a 6-5 freshman for-
ward from Altoona, Pa., is
scheduled to appear in
Holidaysburg Feb. 25 to give
a deposition in a suit filed
against West by Dr. Joseph
Haller.

West claimed that Dr.
Haller, a Pitt booster, offered
him $10,000 to play basket-
ball at Pitt. Haller is suing
West for defamation of
character.

Pitt’s men’s track team paid a visit
to the University of Florida last
weekend, where they took part in a six-
team meet. Going in, the Panthers were
not so interested in running away with

the meet as they were in trying to im—vp

prove the performance of some of their
runners by moving them around.

As the results show, the overall per-
formance was not that bad: they were

qualiﬁed included Calvin Holmes in the
55—meter hurdles. Zeke Gadson in the
55—meter dash, Bob Wciner in the
l.000—meter run and Kim Chichiano in
the 3.000—meter run. As an added
bonus, the mile relay team of Jesse
Mikell. Dorrell Hilliman. Lee McRae
and Alan Laws set a new school record
of 3: 10.24.

Head coach John Vasvary was
pleased with the overall performance
turned in by his team. “We could have
done better if we had moved people
around,“ he said, "but we got done
what we wanted to get done."

Once again, the track events went
very well. but the field events hindered
the team’s ability to score. “We ac-
complished what we wanted to by get-
ting the mile relay to run well, and by
getting some of the other guys to run
well against "strong competition."
Vasvary noted. "We did as well as we
could with no field events.”

copy of the-Administration's
letter to the IFC, a copy of the

As such her letter to the
editor, of 2/3/86, requesting
the arguments of both sides,
