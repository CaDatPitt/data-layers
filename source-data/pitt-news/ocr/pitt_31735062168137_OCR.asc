Students at Pitt and Carnegie-
Mellon University (CMU) protest-
ed President Nixon‘s decision to
send American troops into Cam-
bodia in demonstrations Tuesday.
A major impetus was clearly the
slaying of four Kent State Univer-
sity students by Ohio National
Guardsmen the day before.

 

The protests were largely peace-
ful, but a few hundred students
abandoned non-violence Tuesday
afternoon, immediately after a
rally on the CMU campus. March-
ing on CMU’s Reserve Officers
Training (ROTC) building, the
students broke windows and toss-
ed training manuals outside. Af-

, terward,.they helped clean up.

Simultaneously, approximate-

ly 300 students and faculty mem-

bers met in Clapp Hall and passed
six resolutions which have been
submitted through mail ballot to
the Faculty. of Arts and Sciences
(PAS). Among them were a con-
demnation of "the National Guard
at Kent State University" and a
call for the United States to "unil-
aterally_ and immediately with-
draw all forces from Southeast
Asia." - .

Earlier in the day. Dr. Jack
Matthews. president of the Uni-
versity Senate Council. announc-
ed the cancellation of Tuesdays
classes at Pitt in memory of Kent
State's four dead students. The
decision was made with Chancel-
lor Posvarfs approval.

The University Senate Council
also dispatched Matthews and
Student Government President
Lenny Klavonic to Washington,
D. C., in order to meet with Penn-
sylvania’s congressional delega-
tion-and advise the men that .“the
safety and welfare of the Univer-
sity may well be threatened un-
less the present escalation of the
war in Southeast Asia is revers-
ed.” ’

At a morning rally -on the Cathe- ‘

dral lawn. about 500 onlookers and
s_vmpathizers listened as speak-
ers denounced President Nixon
for widening the Vietnam war and
took occasional potshots at Vice-
President Agnew as well as
American society in general.

Protest '0verrem:ti0n’-Stokes

by POHLA SMITH

 The tragedy this week at Kent

State University is a product of
the same mentality that caused
the bloodshed at the National
Democratic Convention and the
farce at the Chicago Conspiracy

"Trial. Such was the opinion of-

Robert Stokes. Newsweek corres-
pondent. who spoke on the Chicago
Conspiracy Trial Wednesday in
the Student Union. '
Elaborating. Stokes identified
this mentality as overreaction. or
overkill. as the military calls it.
and went on to explain it as "the
last resort to a problem when in-
telligence fails tofind an enlight-
ened approach." Overreaction. he

,.,,\c0ntinued to say. as exhibited by
‘Z-“Jim/Iayor Daley at the Democratic

Convention. President Nixon in
his crackdown on disorder. or
Judge Julius Hoffman at the Chi-
cago Conspiracy trial actually.

.causes more problems than it

solves.

"Overreaction." said Stokes.
"initiated by Judge ‘Hoffman and
cultivated by the defendants. cre-
atedthe stage for the trail. which
appeared to be a one ac_t play of
ego tripping.

Stokes‘explained that the main
question surrounding the trial was
“Who were the courtroom provo-

;;’*;§ateurs?” 'I_‘hough_ the defendants"

stoke felt ha -‘ti

    
 

government were “psyched up
from the onset," that they were‘
“spoiling for battle.”

"Judge Hoffman." the report-
er commented. "had boiling wa-
ter in his veins"-—he took each
gesture as an assault to his digni-
ty. Because Hoffman's overreac-
tions such as shackling and gag-
ging of Bobby Seale and his sen-

tencing ofthe defense for con-

tempt engendered many addition-

al problems for the .trial. Stokes‘

felt Hoffman came to represent
all the New Left wanted to tear
down and caused a radicalization
of many previously emotionally
uninvolved people. Stokes includ-
ed.’ '

Stokes declared many lawyers
felt that a little open-mindedness
on the part of the judge and prose-
cution would have enabled the
Conspiracy Trial to -be a true case
of the nevglconspiracy laws. rather
than a "radicalization process.-
“The‘ point is." be emphasized.
"that the authorities would have
it no other way: they will not give
an inch. Laws cannot be broken." -

The young correspondent com-
mented that the trial was clearly
of a political. rather than a crimin-
al. nature. "Because of the word-

ing of the law." he noted. "it dealt ‘
' with words and ideas. rather than

deeds." He found the trial to be a

_ repudiation. of the jjdgefendants life _.

 

-mes

   
  
 

 

Referring to the dubious con-

-stitutionality of the conspiracy

laws, Stokes asked rhetorically
why the government chose to pro-
secute eight men by a question-
able law, one that threatens the
right of free speech. “All it ac-
complished,” he declared, “was
a further polarization of Ameri-
can society.

The mustached journalist

stressed that "all were involved V

in the legal farce." and went on to
give examples of the slapstick ac-
tivities in the courtroom. He com-

'mented. "Judge Hoffman opened‘

a Pandora's box of wisecracks."

Stokes accused Hoffman of us-
ing the contempt charges as a
_weapon instead of a deterrent by
waiting until the trial's comple-
tion to hand out the sentencing. He
found the contempt charges a
"vindictive striking out" by Hoff-
man that- added credence to the
belief that Hoffman was "out to
get 'em.“

Though Stokes had previously
declared that he had "doubts from
the obset of the trial that Dame
Justice could emerge with her_
chastity intact." ‘he concluded by
saying. "the trial had administer-
ed a black eye wholly undeserving
to our judicial system." His con-
viction was that Hoffman's con-
duction of the trial was "not nor-
mal.“ ‘but an aberration. which in-

APPROXIMATELY 500 interested and concerned students gathered on the in
Cathedral lawn Tuesday morning to hear speakers denounce the war in

South East Asia.
were received with enthusiastic
cries of "Right On!"

A memorial service at Heinz
Chapel followed the rally. Rev.
Charles Carlson spoke. express-
ing sympathy for the four dead
Kent State students and deplor-
ing the war in Southeast Asia.
"God has never sanctioned any
war." he declared firmly.

Approximately 1.500 students
attended a 1 p.m. rally at CMU.
between Skibo and Warner Halls.
They listened as a CMU student
called for a strike "against the
war and the official murder of stu-
dents. .

“To continue ‘business as us-
ual’ on our campuses,” the speak-
er maintained, “would be an ab-
dication of our most elementary
responsibilities as citizens and hu-
man beings .‘. . we've got to show
our numbers, solidarity, and de-
termination to end the war.” .

Dr. H. Guyford Stever. CMU
president, drew a mixed reaction
from the crowd as he read from a
prepared text. "We have closed
our University‘s normal events
today in commemoration of the
students who were killed‘ yester-

_ day."lhe declared.

Stever.-who said he feels the
war in Southeast Asia “is serious-
ly dividing our nation and not ac-
complishing any worthwhile
goals," nevertheless called for a

a special trip to Washington, D.C.,

Wednesday to meet with Penn--

‘ ators with the intent of conveying

the critical situation on campuses
today. especially at Pitt. A ‘

Klavonic was accompanied by

Dr. Jack Matthews. president of‘

the University Senate Council.
According to Klavonic. the main

point.-. stressed to the legislators

was the feeling of frustration
which the events of the past week,
have ‘caused in many students.

rational discussion of the war and .
urged that it “be conducted in a 1 _
free atmosphere. without vio- .- __
lence, without coercion." * 

The University's Dr. David
Montgomery followed Stever and
pleaded -for unity. "The time has
come to bury all sectarianism and
division" among us." he argued. .
All Americans, he contended, , ‘
should unite in their opposition to
the widening of the_ war and the .
events at Kent State.  ‘

Harr of Stanton Heights, there-.

of the Kent State‘ protest, em-- "
phasizing repeatedly that demon-
strators at his school were not" _
militants‘ but students who felt 
they should be allowed to express
themselves on their own campus.

Denying that National'Guards--
menwere provoked by a student‘  ‘
sniper. he said he heard no shots
until the Guardsmen opened fire. 1:?
Describing the changed attitudes V _
of Kent State students as the int  A
cident unfolded, Harr explained '
that the issue was at first "Amer-.
ican aggression in Cambodia" but
later became the presence of the
military at Kent State. ' '

Directed by Dr. Leland Starnes,
it is a story of Venice in the early

comedy, revolves around the fol-
lowing: “Beatrice, a woman cap-
able of any ruse to get her lover,
has arrived in Venice disguised as
her dead brother in order to find

. her lover, the tempestous Florin-

do.

“Florindo has killed Beatrice‘s

"All in further complicated by

‘University professor Lawrence

Lee, essayist and poet, wrote a
three-page article in The Pitts-

. burgh Press last Sunday which

condemned the “Now Genera-
tion” (of being) deluded and
vain, and which claimed that
student activists are generally
insincere in their goals.
Dramatically opening by say-
ing that American universities
are under attack, Lee spends
most of his article reviewing
some major_ issues which he
feels point to the “glibness”
‘and “hostility” of today’s youth.

The issues: Vietnam, racial
inequalities, and relevancy in
education.

According to Lee, the rea-
son that the “Now Generation”
is deluded into thinking that
they have the answers to these
problems is very simple: parents,
especially fathers, and school
and government officials have
“abdicated” their authority over

young people during their for-

mative years.

by PAUL LeBLANC
RSU Treasurer

The war in Southeast Asia is
spilling over into our own coun-
try. We are rightfully shocked
that four students were killed
and many more wounded by
troops in nearby Ohio.

._ We are also rightfully shocked
that the President of the United
States has justified these deaths
and, in effect, givesa go-ahead
to further violent supression of
impassioned protest and social
discontent.

-But we must not forget that
the same use and justification
of brutality and killing has for
many years been the standard
government attitude toward the
people of Southeast Asia, to-
ward those of other Third World
areas. and toward black Ameri-
cans.

We must not lose sight of the
fact that this is part of a larger
violence used'around the world‘
‘to maintain an oppressive status
quo.

the world or human nature. And
it might make senseif one hasn't
read anything else in his entire
lifetime. Otherwise, it is as
transparent as a piece of Saran
Wrap. _

According to Lee’s article.
it makes perfect sense to be-
lieve that the reason young peo-
ple are articulate about the Viet-
nam war (a war which many
educated men of Lee’s own gen-
eration seriously believe exists
only for economic reasons) is
because the traditional authori-

ties “abdicated" their power
over them when they were
young. '

“FATHER-RAPERS’ ’

In more simple terms: the rea-
son a young fellow can talk
about the war so easily is be-
cause-his father didn't have
strong authority over him. That
made him vain and deluded
and now he thinks that he can
dare think of a solution to end
a war. Foolish boy!

Lee makes a strong appeal
through his use of patriotism.
He notes that there are many
legitimate channels for change.

It might have been nice of him

What In Hell Has Happened To T

Cambodia is another manifesta-
tion of this violence. We see the
same pattern which entangled
us in Vietnam emerging again.
With CIA support, right-wing
Cambodian army officers have
established a new regime com’-
mitted to fighting against "our“
enemies (i.e., left-wing national
liberation forces) in Southeast

Asia.
Yet as Newsweek lMay 4.
1970) notes. the "Viet Cong“

is more popular among the ma-
jority of Cambodians than is the
new regime. which has been
saved only by the invasion of
U.S. and South Vietnamese
troops. '

NO MORE DEMOCRACY

The widening of the war
indicates that the content of
American "democracy" has

drained away. According to a.
recent Gallup Poll. 35 percent
of those surveyed oppose send-
ing even arms and material to
Cambodiaand 58 percent are
opposed to sending U.S. troops.

to mention, however. that young
people cannot vote on the issues
which they vainly persist in
having solutions for.

Lee ‘does not seem to under-
stand that it is extremely diffi-
cult for a young person to "seek
to change what he does not
truly like while supporting even
the errors until they can be
changed without defection" when
most /legislators. and adults in
general. have no requirement
or inclination to listen to the
suggestions of young people. »

One wonders. for example.
what Lee himself would do if
he were of draft age. if Presi-
dent Nixon were threatening to
end his college deferment. and
if he realized that. by the time
the errors were solved. he might
be underground in a wooden
box. having received a nice mili-
tary funeral and the playing of
"Taps" on the bugle. And re-
member. he couldn‘t use his
voting rights to end any of it
because he wouldn‘t have any.

One-would think that. under
such circumstances._ Lee would
come up with a solution in his
own mind to avoid such an un-
fortunate occurrance. I. for

believe that the United States
would not "be able to avoid a
major involvement of our troops
in the Cambodia situation!"

That is. although a majority
of the people oppose the widen-

.ing of the war. they recognize

that they have no say in major
foreign policy decisions.

We believe that there is a
clear relationship between the
widespread investments of U.S.

corporations in Asia. Africa, and _

Latin America and the nature
of ‘American foreign policy in
these areas: we note that the
key U.S. policy makers come
from the upper ranks of (or
closely identify with) the major
corporations.

Moreover. we believe that
there is a relationship between
the fact that a) the American
people exercise no democratic
control over the vast concentra-
tion of corporate economic
power in the United States and
b) the American -people exer-
cise no democratic control over
U.S. foreign policy. (All of this
is documented in: G_ William

or deluded for having done so.

LEAVE MY PARENTS
OUT OF IT

I do not care one bit for the
slur that Lee made against my
parents. I'm not an activist.
but I happen to hate war.
hate racial inequalities. and hate

the other evils he mentions in “

his article.

And I think I have. in my own-
mind at least. an opinion on how
these problems can be solved.
That does not mean that my par-
ents did a bad job. does it‘? In
fact. I think they did a great
job; for this I will always re-
spect and love them. A

_And there are quite a few
other parents like them. may

I add; parents who raised fine.

children whether they “abdi-
cated their inherent authority"
or not. '

The same goes for teachers.
In fact. Lee even says himself
that "there could be no more
important assignment‘ than that
of seeking to develop indepen-
dent thought and just values in
the natures of other‘people’s
children.”

_ And. just to show that the
government hasn‘t abdicated any
of its authority. look at the ma-
jor newspapers of last Monday.
Under the headline that has

there's a little authority left
in government. Unfortunately.
in thiscase.

Admittedly. Lee made some
good points in his article: he
gave some ligitimate facts. But
it is my firm opinion that there
is absolutely nothing to be gain-
ed by the vicious criticisms that
he gave to some of the activi-

ties of the "Now Generation." 

It certainly seems clear to me
that his role as a University pro-

‘ fessor is to provide guidance to

the “Now Generation." which
definitely still has a lot_ to

Racked Agahi

Dearest Mr. Rosenberg:

How good it was to hear from
one of the many long—suffering
campus cranks about the Tuck
Shop food!

“The Tuck Shop is perhaps the

worst place to eat on the entire
campus." Why. you are percep-
tive. Mr. Rosenberg!

You could have noticed the

starchy. over-cooked meals so
frequently remarked upon by
dorm rats.

You might have recalled the
Tuck Shop last year, when it was
a dingy. dirty hole. But no, the
contributing gourmet attacked
this year's Tuck Shop. probably
the best operation on campus.

Maybe I just see things a little
differently. I've worked behind
the line for Saga Foods for three
years. spending time at every
one of their campus operations. '

I've carried '18 credits and
worked 20-40 hours a week, be-
cause I believe in paying all my
own expenses.

I've taken all the garbage from

‘A other students I could stomach,’

because many student-snobs treat
hired help like dirt. Oh, when they
found out I was a student, they
were sweet enough . . .

And you,’ Mr. Rosenberg are
probably the sweetest of all.
There are many among the 5,000
daily customers who c.ome
through and vent their academic
venom and socially hang-up spleen
in cracks about the Tuck Shop.

They’re usually the same ones
who steal’ sandwiches and stuff
their faces with.-donuts so they
can get something for free.

Oh, I respect your complaints.
dear Arthur. By the end of the ‘day
salads on any counter look vague-
ly wilted; steps have been taken
to keep the hot dogs and ham-
burgers fresher since your com-
plaint. x

Youg might not like the chili,
but if we do not serve it at least

once a week. the other Greater 1

You should also know that the 1

criticize most.

Dear Majorie:

I reply to your response be-
cause I find it refreshing — and
above all a different point of view.
Being a worker in the Saga Food
operation — your viewpoint is in-
deed perceptive in a different way.

Your criticism, however, leaves
the realm of my critique rather
quickly and delves into quite an-

_ other matter.

I have witnessed every type of

reaction which you have mention- -

ed and I join with you in deploring
those who are rude and downright
vicious to workers such as your-
self—who in fact have no control
over the food Saga serves.

Perhaps the more immature of
the student body have not yet ad-
justed to leaving mother.

If they steal from and abuse
their parental guardians — I sup-
pose we will see it on campus.
Perhaps though —— it is imma-
ture — yet just anger at some-
thing that cannot be tolerated.

I still, however. maintain that I

the Tuck Shop has the facilities
for a grill and deep frying equip-
ment, etc‘. — and could establish
a_ food operation similar to the
Hunt Room.

It’s terrific that the Tuck Shop
has improved — but let it not stop
there . . . it's not completely all
bad — and not yet . . . close to be-

. ing what it could.

Editor. The Pitt News:

Undoubtedly. those who are a
part of the business world. daily
encounte_r bizarre situations. Hav-
ing recently emerged from the
unreal wgrld of academia, I am-

' both shocked and sickened by the

regression shown by society.

Two incidents, occurring in one
day,.more than serve to illustrate
my evaluation.

Situation No. 1-1 am sitting on
a neighborhood bus. A young boy
enters with his mother. He is
wearing a ski jacket with an army
camouflage design. On the back
of the jacket is written, "Da
Nang"; beneath this is written,
“Vietnam.”

The glorification of an immoral.
ridiculously inane war was be-
yond my comprehension. until I
realized that it was just another
way to make an “honestbuck. "

Situation No. 2——I am sitting on
a subway on way downtown. Sud-
denly. a policeman enters from
another car and begins pacing up

_and down my car —— eyeing each

passenger suspiciously.

It seems as though he is about
to strike someone — anyone — at
any second (of course, the thought
that he might strike me never en-
tered my mind).

My first reaction was an in-

tense feeling of fear. (Fear of the

though I was on my way to a con-
centration camp. and this ape
was in charge of keeping order.

Law and order . . . law and or-
der . . . while these words ran
through my mind. I looked around
at the other people in the subway.
Some expressed fear; “ most ex-
pressed apathy. These people
have gotten used to it!

Team Faces Buffalo
And Syracuse Nines

By MARTY HELLMAN

After posting _a 7-4 record against area opponents in the first
‘month of the season. the baseball team packed its bags and headed
to upstate New York thos weekend. The imitters will meet the Buf-
falo Bulls today and the Syracuse Orangemen tomorrow.

The Panthers will see a lot of action during the two‘ days as
two doubleheaders ’

ing a 2-1 victory over Syracuse.
Half of their games were play-
e_d during a Southernxtrip early
in the Spring. ‘

Coach Bill _Monkarsh has

‘ twelve returning lettermen from

last year’s squad which recorded
a 14-16 mark. Leading the...,Bulls

is_. third baseman Don Jok, who.

batted .313 last season. Jokhas
pitched upon occasion, and also

plays all three. outfield positions}, 2

He is presently hitting .484.

The Bulls have great depth in .

the pitching corps with a staff
of eleven‘ hurlers. sJok’s older
brother, Stan, 7Paul Lang and

V Steve Nelson, are the top pitch-

ers., , . 3  _

"but I won’t know until game time
who the pitcher" for the second
game, will be.” I'd like to have
Mike Fedoris start the second
game." he continued, "but. right
now he has a slight sore arm:” 

If Fedoris is. iiiiahie -to pitch".

either _Frank_lMinca’relli or -Al-

The Westminster match was
fought right down to the wire,
with the deciding match being the
lastdouble.

_The teams split the singles. 3-3.
Westminster took’ the first ‘dou-
bles match, 2-6, 6-2. 6-2.

Pitt captured the second dou-
bles match with Mike Dzadowsky

and Joel Hurwitz coming out on '

top with 6-3, 6-0. Hurwitz has the
team’s best individual record, 6-3.

Coach Fran Webster attributed T

theloss to a lack of experience on
the part of his squad. -

"We lost in the doubles match-
‘es. We need to work on our dou-
bles.“

’ Theiteam also lost to West Vir-

ginia in the last doubles match.
"They have a real fine team.

We hoped we‘ could sneak it out

but we didn't make it,” said Web-

. ster. _
1The wind was also a factor in
‘Wedn_'esday’s match.

“It affected both sides,” the
coach stated, “but the way the

 wind _blows determines points. ”
