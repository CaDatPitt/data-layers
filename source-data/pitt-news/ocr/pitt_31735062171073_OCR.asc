Dean Rusk Discusses
SE. Asia Water cite

I

by RITA VITOLO

Dean Rusk, Secretary of State
under Presidents Kennedy and
Johnson, held a short news con-
ference in Pittsburgh Friday.
Rusk was scheduled to speak at
the University’s School of Gen-
eral Studies that evening.

"I would be very much sur-
prised if we would go back to
Southeast Asia in any way," Rusk
said.

He admitted though the peace
agreement “in itself was a good
one.” Rusk felt, however, that
the efficiency of the treaty would
depend on the extent to which
Moscow and Peking also intended
to honor the spirit of peace in
Southeast Asia.

Rusk sees no chance for peace
in the Middle East until there is a
return to conditions which existed
before the Seven-Day War.

When asked if the Watergate
affair would prove to be a "mor-
tal wound for the Republican Par-
ty, Rusk avoided a discussion of
the situation by saying, “I was
never much involved in partisan
politics.“ As for impeachment
proceedings against President
Nixon, Rusk commented. “Any-
thing that dimishes a President
in the eyes of the people he was
elected to represent, diminishes.
moreover, their confidence in his
ability to act in matters of inter-
national importance.

“Still, if the proceedings in-
volved in a study like the Penta-
gon Papers could continue with-
out my awareness, I have com-
plete sympathy with how an af-
fair like Watergate could contin-
ue without President Nixon's full
awareness," Rusk concluded.

$5 Add-Drop Fee ‘Unfair’

by DREW PORVAZNIK

Student Government (SGi met
Thursday, May 3. to discuss items
including the $5 add-drop fee. pro-
posals from the Pitt PIRG organ-
ization, poor lighting in the Com-
mons Room, and discrimination
against commuters.

SG announced that the Univer-
sity agreed not to use the $5 add-
drop fee for the fall term. It was
felt that the $5 fee would be un-
fair for the fall because students
had registered for the term be-
fore the fee was announced. SG
also fears the fee will penalize
students who have legitimate
causes for add-dropping and
would be discriminatory to the
poor and under-privileged.

The SG Board stated there are
also problems with registering
that the $5 fee doesn’t solve, such
as situations where teachers
aren’t listed for a particular
course which cause students to
add-drop, or situations where ad-
visors tell students to register
for any course to get the minimum
12 credits hoping that via add-
drop, the students eventually can
get into the courses they want.

A representative from the Pitt
PIRG chapter, Brady Moore. de-
fended three proposals that the
PIRG organization made. The
propositions were that the annual
PIRG fee that some students pay
be placed on the invoice. that
PIRG be allowed to have mater-
ials placed in the invoice packets
and that the organization receive
a direct proprotion of the activ-
itiesfee.

A motion was made to table the
proposals until next weeks meet-
ing. SG said that it would prob-
ably be legally impossible to have
PIRG annual fee placed on the in-
voice and physically impossible
for PIRG to have information

placed in the invoice packets be-
cause they are to be discontinued.

Board member Bob Heister dis-
cussed his meeting with Joseph
Dutton, Vice Chancellor of Oper-
ations, concerning the poor light-
ing in the Common’s Room. Dut-
ton agreed to study the prob-
lem. Heister said the lighting sit-
uation needs to be greatly im-
proved. He said that it is a “mir-
acle if you can see in the Com-
mons Room.”

Heister also discussed two
areas of concern to commuters—
transportation and registration.
He insists there is discrimination
against these students by placing
high rates for parking near the
University and by having meter
maids tag cars ‘more frequently
in the Oakland area, as compared
to East Liberty.

Heister believes there should
be openings available in classes
to avoid situations where a com-
muter gets closed out of a week-
day class and must instead come

on Saturday, despite the fact that

he or she may live as far away as

by GEORGE ZRUST

The fifth session of the Labor
Education Workshop series was
held Thursday. Ma_v 3. at 7 p.m.
in Cathedral of Learning.

Speaking on collective bargain-
ing and contract negotiation were
Ann Lepsi of the Pennsylvania
Federation of Teachers IPFTI
and Robert Housholder. com-
missioner. Federal Mediation
Service.

Housholder explained that the
Federal Mediation Service was
set up under the Labor and Man-
agement Relations Act of 1947 and
deals with contract expiration
problems. The service presently

‘employs a nationwide staff of’500

people, 260 of whom are media-
tors. _ ‘

Housholder then pointed, out
that the Mediation Service can
only be called into a labor-man-
agement dispute if both sides
agree to it. and they can ask a
mediator to leave at any time.
Housholder, however. noted‘ that
Federal mediators "can work all
night" at ironing out differences
if the parties are willing to set-
tle.

  Negotiations Discussed

Lepsi outlined the collective
bargaining process. beginning
with union determination of rank-
and-file sentiment and continuing
through the actual negotiating and
voting on aggreements.

For the past three years Lepsi
has been a PFT staff representa-
tive, working in organizing teach-

. ers and in colletive bargaining.

The Pittsburgh Federation of
Teachers. ,local affiliate of the
Pennsylvania body. represents all
Pittsburgh city school teachers.

Lepsi said that collective bar-
gaining is "the only time that em-
ployer and employee become
equals" and that they try to
achieve an agreement both sides
can live with. .

Housholder also showed a mo-

vie of a mock mediation session
to further demonstrate the ne-
gotiating procedure.

Both Lepsi and Housholder an-
swered audience questions after
their ‘speeches.

The workshop series is spon-
sored by the University's Office Ql
Urban and Community Services.

he woke he knew every word in
the book. . . {At 12 he saw an an-

"Cayce." Davidson continued.
"could predict future events . . .
wish sick people back to health

A few months ago the Israeli
government arrested four Jews

   One Were A Footballls Scholar

By MILLIE HENRY

Everyplace you -look the past couple of weeks. '

you see that the new coach of the Pitt football

.-team has been "recruitingaggressively" again. "He ” ‘

has been getting better football players than any-
one in the recent past to come to Pitt for their
athletic and academic careers. According to

some stories Mr. Majors has been convincing
-young men who ‘ would ' have gone to other
schoo1s..some of which are athletic rivals of Pitt,

to choose the blue and gold uniforms of the Pan-

-thers.

~ As a’ coach, {Mrs Majorsis -doing just what

the people whohired him ‘wanted him to do, and.

he seemsto .be doing it well. He only seems to
have onereal complaint. He cannot recruit _as

many football players as he would like to.

There are rules in_-‘the intercollegiate athletic
organizations about what can be offered to a pros-

’ pective student who knows how to play football.
" Outright offers of cash are not permitted, but they

can be reimbursed for laundry expenses. Gifts

of a conspicuous sort are discouraged. _In' effect. ‘
all the, coa-ch can-offer is’ a full scholarship, in-_

cluding tuition room and board. and about twen-

‘ ty-five dollars a month in cash. Besides that, he

can offer a chance toplay on.the team heis
coaching. If the team doesfwell. this can be the
key to a long andrich career inprofessional foot-
ball. ‘ ‘ - V ‘

.Any young (man who plays football well in
high school is almost sure to have his choice of sev-
eral colleges. He will be .offei_‘edscholarships. . ‘

Mr. Majors only “has about fifty scholarships

, to offer. This means he can‘t afford. to‘pick any

young men who.will not return his investment -in

I them.

»_ l
This sounds like Mr. Majors_is spending his

«own money—he is not. I-don’t know where the

money comes from . Thesports budget at Pitt is
confidential. Only the‘ Chancellor can release the
exact figures, according to the Director of Ath-

. letics in a recent question-and-answer session.

I‘ only started thinking about the athletic
scholarships when I saw an item in the daily
newspaper. It said that ‘the University of Pitts-
burgh was providing more Merit Scholarships than
ever in its history.-. There were fourteen of
them. i ‘ , P‘ -

If we can afford fifty scholarships for the foot-
ball team alone. and god knows how many for the
basketball. baseball. tennis. hockey. golf. swim-
ming. track. gymnastics. frisbie and chess teams.
why are there only fourteen scholarships available

for scholars? i ~ P _ P . PP »P

the word the way my "dictionary "suggests: “ex-

‘_ clusively devoted to one gender.”

)  is not a very good argument. If the other

‘ teams are made up“ only of men,—and the ‘largest

men at that, we would have no advantage in send-

P ing women ‘out on the_field.‘ Most women are
smaller than _most men. .I only wonderabout one .

thing. " .
Why do they call them scholarships?

P “Obviously, every '.uni_versity needs ‘ scholars."
They are an ornament -to the institution, and with-

out them the university would soon die. If a pros-

I -pective student shows great promise as a scholar._

it is to the universitysadvantage to invitehim.

The remission of tuition is a ‘symbol of the mu-
tual advantage to the scholar _and the university
_of the scholars presence there. I

Now we have the athletic scholarship. There is
nothing about the game of" football, for instance.

_ to prevent those who play it from being scholars.
Thereis even less about the way college football’ '

works to make scholars of the players. '
If you are a man,'— the art of kicking, throwing,
or catching a football can get you a freeride.

If you can notafford an education, youmight
get a free ride. but the chances are not so good.

A Need is the main criterion. If you are only a

scholar. forget it!

The university can ‘only afford fourteen schol-
,ars-peryear. . i ‘ -—

4 At least the scholars are more or less evenly di-
vided as far-as their sex is concerned. You do
have‘to be a man to Pgeta Merit Scholarship.

I don't mean that football f players are auto-
mically dummies. There are two standards" for this
k_ind of scholarship. and I_ think Pitt uses the high-
er one. The lowerone requires a "predictor" that

‘ the athlete can maintain. a 1.6 (yes, 1.6!) average.
. The highercalls for a likely average of 2.0.

Bywthe way. I understand that the football
team was orginally organized to provide exercise
and a spirit of healthy competition to men of the
university: it didn‘t say anything about recruiting.

It'doesn‘t matter. but why do they call it
scholarship‘? I I ‘ ’

And what would happen to a man or woman al-
readyﬁenrolled in the. university if he or ‘she ap-
plied to the football team for exer'cise'_in_ a spirit

. of competition?

-Even if we don’t ha"ve‘~“’scholarships”, ‘maybe
we. should all apply to Mr. Majors. , I ‘

I101 P

by DAVID J. MAJERNIK ‘

It has often been said that a
housewife‘s work is neverdone.
This old cliche is even more ap-
propriate for the work of Conrad‘
Neuner.
window washer.

Conrad claims he washes over
200.000 of the University's 2 mil-
lion windows each year.

“If I were to wash every win-
dow in every building on cam-
pus,” said Neuner, “it would take
over three years.”

Conrad was hired by the Uni-
versity in 1968 to wash the win-
dows of the Cathedral of Learn-
ing. The windows of other cam-
pus buildings, at that time. had
been contracted to an outside
firm. However. in 1970, the out-
side contract was cancelled in an
economy move. and Conrad was
charged with washing all the
windows on campus.

Neuner said he ‘vividly remem-
bers his first day on the job.
Thinking that he would start on
the lower floors of the Cathedral
and work up, Conrad was -led to
the eighteenth floor.

“I was horrified — I was scar-
ed to death,” chuckled Neuner as

’ he reminisced. “The first day I
washed just four windows be- '

cause I used only one hand. With
the other hand I was holding on
for dear life because I didn’t

trust the supporting belt.”

Conrad then explained that he
hangs out windows. supported
by a belt attached to hooks on

each side of the window.

The Cathedral,_ with its 3000
windows, said Neuner, is still
the most challenging building.

"There are more different

its price.

 
      

the University‘s sole—

opus one

kinds of windows in the Cathe-
dral than in any building I
know." claimed Conrad. "The
windows of Nationality Rooms
have the most unusual shapes and
I have to wash most of them by
hand.”

It takes three months to wash
all the windows in the Cathedral,
reported Neuner.

Conrad lives in the Elliot sec-
tion of Pittsburgh with his wife
and two little girls. He is in his
thirties. about average height.

with short brown hair and a mus-_

tache. and a mischievous twinkle
in his eyes. Before coming to
Pitt. Neuner said, he had no ex-
perience washing windows. He
had been an automobile mechan-
lC.

“Someone told me they needed
a window washer at Pitt. I ap-
plied for the job and got it,”
said Conrad.

Neuner takes great pride in his

» work.

"I‘m just like a mailman." he
said._ "No matter what the wea-
ther." the windows must get
washed."

In the winter. Conrad explain-
ed. he washes windows on the in-
side. However, he claims to have
worked outside when it was only
20 degrees and also during a
blizzard.

One of the advantages of his
job, said Neuner, is that he gets

to meet so many interesting peo-

pie.

‘'1 probably meet everyone who
works here at Pitt. Curious peo-
ple often come up to me and
ask questions aboutmy job."

Conrad said he even met Chan-
cellor Posvar once while wash-

$69.00 is the cost of a loudspeaker that
is so wide in frequency range and so
smooth and natural in sound that
substituting it in your sound system
(mono, stereo, or quad) will make a
dramatic improvement. The smaller
advent loudspeaker not only outper-
forms every speaker in its class but
many other speakers three times

The smaller advent loudspeaker can
also be driven by-low-priced amplifiers
and receivers. Its 4 ohm impedance is
designed specifically for present solid
stateunits and can be driven most
satisfactorily by the better receivers
in the $200 - $300 class.

The smaller advent is the only speaker
in its price range that can reproduce

ing the bullet-proof windows of
the Chancellor's first floor suite
in the Cathedral. Posvar question-
ed him about the difficulty of his
job and asked if he liked what he
was doing. said Neuner.

Shortly afterwards, he said, he
was informed never to wash the
Chancellor’s windows without first
making an appointment for a time
when the Chancellor was out.

A Window Wosher’s Work is Never Done 

while washing windows on the
fourth floor of the Cathedral.
Conrad said. he took off his
shirt. But some modest soul. who
peaked out of a fifth floor win-
dow. noticed the bare-chested
window washer and reported that
he was walking around the roof
naked. Neuner‘s boss rushed to
the scene and ordered him to put
on his shirt and never take it off
again while on the job.

Conrad, it was discovered that'”*“’

cial crisis at the University. C0n- 
rad said. he has been told to . 
wash only those windows in pub- 
lic areas. while windows of pri-- 
vate offices are neglected. 
Neuner said he fails to under-
stand this reasoning since the
University is paying him the
same salary "no matter what
windows he washes. But the ex-
perts believe they are saving mon- 
ey. K
Benedum Hall has. the dirtiest , '—;—-2
windows on campus, said Conrad,
because they have never all been 
washed since the building was"
completed three years ago.

_.*_~.j::‘.   .""“‘f.:».\‘,-,1 is}.-V '

Also because of the financial
crisis,‘Conrad said, the only sup”-_
plies the University provides him
is a bucket of water. He gets
no window washingvsolution.

  
  
    
    
    
  
    
      
    
     
  
   
    
   
   
      
       
 
   
   
   
   
   
   
    
 
   
   
   
   
   
     
    
 
   
   
   
     
     
  

“'I’ve experimented with dif-
ferentvkinds of cleaning mater- -
ials we have available (at the]
Facilities Maintenance Depart-‘
ment of Physical Plant), and have ,
found that the floor cleaner cleans
the windows best.” said Neuner.

He explained that University
windows are so filthy from ne-
glect that a strong solution must -
be used to get them clean. '

.When the window washing con- v. .__.;
tractors were discontinued, said-

he could clean windows more
cheaply than an outside firm.
So plans were made-to hire sev-'
eral additional window wash-=
ers to help Conrad. But the bud-
get cutbacks came, and the idea .
was scrapped. -

So it looks like Conrad Neuner 
will still be the only washer we'll‘ 
see hanging out of campus win-I 
dows for at least the next few « '
years. '

Posvor Speaks of

Women's Assoc. Lunch

' (Continued from Page 1)

"Unlike other universities."
Posvar began, "we are under-

 _ built -in .housing. Too many stu-
 dents are forced to live in sub-

standard tenament dwellings. We

 need more housing to compete
’ with the private market.”

The Chancellor said the num-

 ber one non-academic need is the

  improvement and renovation of
 the Student Union. “A new wing

 for added space would make Pitt
 one of the finest physical cam-
"i . puses in the United States.”

Posvar concluded his report

 saying the University must be-
I. come‘ concerned with social engi-
 neering to harness and place
 technological advances in service.

 

‘. Preceding the. Chancellor‘s ad-'
 dress, Frances J. Roland, presi-

dent of the Women’s Association.

 presented two checks totaling $1,-
 000 to representatives of two stu-
- dent loan funds.

Thanking the Women’s Associa-
tion, Rege _ Kaufman, Student

cepted the second check for the

Pendrell Cose Evokes Second Suit

(Continued from Page 1)
James Diggory has also said in
an interview with The Pittsburgh
Forum, that Pendrell was not per-
mitted to appear in person at his
committee to discuss her case.

Dr. Fred Adelman, Chatham an-
thropology professor and treas-
urer of the Nan Pendrell Defense

istrations actions. “Chatham Col-

how the College helps young
women to ‘realize their potential

and King Crimson shook the Alpine Arena with their

. The show was late in starting, but nobody real-

grass being passed around to turn on half the city.

No city policemen marred the scene by their
presence-only a couple of private dicks, who stay-
ed well out of sight. The scene was definitely in
distinct contrast to the enforced security/no smok-
ing/no drinking/no nothing at the Mosque and
Arena.

Spooky Tooth opened the bill and were quite
impressive. It wasthe first time I had ever heard

' Spooky's musicis basically rock, but they get
into some Moog-sounding things without actually
employing -one. It’s a “wall of sound”-type situa-
tion, carrying the crowd along on its front. Their
hour-long set was well—received, but apparently
the crowd was half Foghat-freaks, and shouts for
their group downed out the applause. —'

content merely to do their little rhythm numbers. _

His exchanges with David Cross’ electric vio-

Hair sfy/isf discovers

  Heady Lease on Life

by STEVE LUBETSKY
Sometimes nothing less than a dramatic overhaul in one's mode
of living is the solution to a quest for peace-for mind. Such was the
conclusion of Julian Gil. a hair stylist at Weitzner's Beauty'Salon.
when he decided on his present pursuit.

A native of Cuba. Gil came to this country shortly after the Castro

regime assumed power. and from the Cuban branch was transferred

to local Pittsburgh Plate Glass. "1 went to Puerto Rico ‘and worked
there two" years. I then returned to Pittsburgh and worked at Gateway."

It wasat this time when Gil discovered that something was lack-
ing. “-I was bored, and I wanted‘ to change my life style. I never touch-
ed hair before, but I went to.Pitts_burgh Beauty Academy, took a tour,
and I became interested.”

So the industrious Gil attended night classes at the Academy. still

keeping his routine position at Pittsburgh Plate Glass in the day.

"When I was at the end of my course. I quit my office job." as he be-
gan his search for fresh pastures. -
, Regarding his current employer. Gil relates that "I just love it.
I'm ableto travel and do anything I, like. "

 Describing his method, Gil admitted that basically, he is conser-
vative. “I’work according to features of the person, such as texture
and abundance of hair, and pliability. -

'-"I do thingsdifferent-ly with young people. or if I know a person

A for a whi1e,‘but I never ‘experiment on ones first visit. I'll do things

unusual if it's the trend.

» Now styling hair for three and one-half years. Gil observes rev-
olutions in a variety of techniques. such as rolling. and teasing.’ Refer-

‘ ring to the approach to creating a permanent" wave. he explained that

"-before it was _done with electricity. Now it is done with a chemical.
which takes less time. and is less harmful to hair.“

Gil feels that “the ‘now thing’ is maintaining the natural look. Since
ayear ago,” he notices, -“the style is towards softer, healthier hair,
and more people come in for treatments.”

Among the various changes which have occurred in recent years.

_';perhaps the most profound revolution_has been in the field of men‘s

hair s.tyles_.  , , , y I ,
"Meniare more conscious." according to ‘Gil.."*They’re‘.wearing

-their hair longer, and it must be styled.-1' Moreover. he stressed.

“men are more particular than women.” and he accordin-gly_._st_vles
their hair differently. , ._ = _ ”
Adept at working with both men and women. in either case Gil
evokes the praise of his clients. Said one woman, "He is great. He has
more styling ability than the average hairdresser." whereas a gen-
tleman’s comment was that "he does a greatjob on men's hair."

By JOHN SMITH
Arts Editor

A fine theatrical event hap-
pened last Thursday and Friday
nights at CMU. This was a pre-
sentation of Brendon Behans
The Host_age—the Drama Depart-

ment's senior project. My only re- -

gret is that it‘ wasn't running
for a week or two instead of
just three performances.

The play itself is the last of
two Behan wrote, and deals in a
burlesque way with a very ser-
ious topic. Set in war-torn Ire-
land in the late 50’s it opens with
a rowdy demonstrationiprotesting
the scheduled execution of an Ir-
ish soldier by the British.

It is learned. however. that a

young British soldier has been-

captured and will be held until
the release of the'Irish boy. or
killed as a reprisal. His prison is
a boarding house featuring both
male and female prostitutes. a
border and his evangelistic girl-
friend, and the houses owner. the
kilt-clad. bagpipe blowing Mon-
sewer. Also there is Theresa. the
young housekeeper
who provides romantic interests
for Leslie. the soldier.

In this microcosm Behan liber-

ally doses out his satirical
commentary on the state of Ire-
land and the state of the world.
Thrown in for extra spice are
songs ranging from Irish ball-
ads to half—breed bawdy num-
bers.

Couple this with a very ser-

_ ious examination of the dilemma

of death and love, and you have
what I consider a modern mas-
terpiece of the theatre. It was a

pleasure to see it performed’

again—the Playhouse did a ver-
sion two years ago.

As for the performance itself~
first rate. Excellent interpreta-
tions were given by James Moni-
tor as Pat and Barbara Knowles
as Meg Dillon. These. were the
older leads.’ Pat being a semi-
crippled retired soldier and Meg
his "almost wife.“ Both showed
themselves as skilled actors in the
handling of these dualistic roles
a sensitive cynicism which could
have easily become maudlin if
done by lesser talents.

Unfortunately. the roles of

Leslie (the hostage) and Theresa _

(the young maid) were not quite
as eft'ective..For support. a bet-
ter troupe couldn't have been
found. Notable here were Rich-
ard Ericson as Mr.#Mullheady

Also excellent. although their
speaking parts were minimal.
were the whores and queers.

The serious flaws I found were
the music and the ending. The
music was not from the original
production which used familiar’
tunes for the songs Behan creat-
ed. The replacement of these
tunes with other arrangements took
something from the original which
seemed to be intentionally famil-
iar but with the addition of ab-
surd lyrics. -

The ending (also a song) was
not at all in keeping with Be-
han‘s apparent purpose. It is
sung by Leslie after he is killed
accidentally in a scuffle with
the police. and is titled. "The
Bells. of Hell go tin-ga-ling-a-
ling for you but not for me." Only.
instead of a kind of glorious
transcendance of Leslie‘s good-
ness over the evil of those around
him (Behan was quite an optimist
despite his sradonic view). it was
spat at the audience in a very bit-
ter manner. This was the lowest
point in the play.

Deep Throat

“hear bells ringing, rockets go-
ing off, fireworks exploding“
when she has sex. Her mother.
a swinger if there ever was one.
is concerned for her daughters
happiness, and——after staging an
orgy of unbelievable proportions
that solves nothing but the moth-

er‘s horniness—se'nds her off to a,‘

psychiatrist, Dr. Young.

The good doctor, while perform-
ing an “internal” examination
with a telescope, finds Linda’s
clitoris is missing. Further ex-
amination proves it to be at the
base of her throat. Thus her only
source for happiness and bell-
ringing is to find a man with a
large enough penis (nine inches)
to reach her clitoris.

The doctor fits the bill. but
doesn’t want to get married, so
he makes Linda a "physical ther-
apisti’ and sends her on house
calls. Through these calls. she
meets an assortment of men;
none of whom make her happy.-
"They just don't measure up."

/‘L:-5--*’

-1

she tells the doctor unhappilyw 1:

Finally she meets Wilbur.
whom she loves and who loves
her. and with him she ultimately
hears her bells, rockets, and fire-
works. It's kind of a trick end-
ing. but really an old joke and
satisfying only to Linda.

The male actors seem to have
been ‘chosen merely .for the size

of their equipment, though their -

acting ability is superior to Lin-
da’s. Her talent is unquestion-
ably in_ her mouth, and she avid-
.ly devours every attempt to prove
it.

The photography is excellently
explicit (color)—there is no hesi-

’ tancy about showing everything-

tribadism. sodomy, fellatio. cun-
nilingus. plus a couple I dont
even know names for.

The film does have its hum-
orous moments—Linda comes
home to find the grocery boy
performing cunnilingus on her
mother. who asks Linda for a
cigarette. saying to the boy "Do
you mind if I smoke while you
eat?" '

The question of Deep Throat
is not its obscenity. but the right
of people to see what they want
to see. Although the movie is
far superior to most of its gener._
it's still pornography. and it":‘:J
“redeeming social value."’ if any.
is thin veneer over the excuse of
showingas many sexual acts as
possible.

But let those who want see
this movie—~it’s definitely one to
go to with a member of the
opposite‘ sex-—as it does tend to
get one a bit worked up (which
is the idea, I guess). Duggan
should worry about his own office
and not what’s playing on Lib-
erty Avenue. It’s an adult fea-
ture (they do require I._D. on
those who don't seem to be of
age),and to each their own.

"Its a ‘good thing we played

football coach Johnny Majors, af-

the Gold,‘ 21-7, in Pitt's annual in-

spring drills. ’ P , 6
Majors wasn't really upset with
the playhe had’ seen out on the
field. .He~was cracking too many
jokes. "If I thought the. game was
going to end in a tie, ITd have

a safety. There was no way Iwas

' suffered a 7-2 loss at the hands of
,.West Virginia.‘ It left the netters A

with a 2-3 ‘mark, the first time

~ they have been below .500 in two

years.‘ _

y "The match could have gone
either way,“ said coach Fran
Webster. ‘_'It was. the first time

~ Second seeded Joel Hurwitz lost

‘.‘.George and Joe (Kantor) played

White defense kept the Blue team
out of the end zone as the clock
ran out. "Not scoring in those sit-
uations canlose football games."
said Majors. ’
Melvin Howard. a transfer from
Macon. Ga.. was instrumental in
the two fourth quarter touch-
downs that the Blue scored. al-
though he wasn't involved in ei-
ther -scoring play. Throughout the
day. Howard carried 12 times for
84 yards to lead all rusherswith
a seven yards per carry average.
Howard will have to sit o_ut this
coming season. ‘

The second Blue touchdown was
an 81-yard, 13 play drive, culmin-
ated by quarterback Rich Wash-
inko’s- one-yard plunge for the
score- The final Blue TD came

on-another_ Englert to Bolognese .
pass, this one from 10 yards out,"

and Bolognese didn’t fall short
of pay dirt this time-

Engler't‘s 52 , yards rushing was
second high, and the Gold's Clair
Wilson ‘netted 49 yards to pace the
losers.

Freshman quarterback Anthony

Kozak led all passers with 78"
,yards gained, while Gold team-
mate Bill Daniels had the most .

completions, hitting on six of 12

‘_ attempts.

Washinko completed three of 10
passes for ‘50 yards to lead the
Blue in those departments. Lead-
ing Blue receiver was Bolognese,

‘who pulled in ‘three passes for'42
‘ yards.

Stan Ostrowski caught
three for 43 yards for the ,Gold
squad, and Bruce Murphy netted
51 yards on just two passes. '

'."'I,was pleased to see the boys
out there doing the job." com-
_mented Majors. “We have some
people that can play football. but
notenough.” ' . .

Employing a virtual constant
offensive attack. the Panthers
rolled up their second victory of

" the young summer hockey season

by bombarding the 'l‘igers. 9-0.

Thursday night.

For a team that lost the ma-
jority of their high scorers. the
Panthers appeared no worse for

I the wear. Except for a brief mo-

merits’ in the first ‘and third per-
iods. the puck was constantly kept
in the Tigers end. The Tigers

in the first and third periods.

Ron Siegel. Duke Schaeffer. Joe
Testa. and Jim Sipes all scored
twice while Rich Baginski notched
a lone tally. After a close check-
ing first period that ended with
the Panthers clinging to a 1-0
lead. the pace of the game switch-
ed and it turned into a one sided
affair. to say the least.

Mack was tested late in the first
period when he turned away two
Tiger skaters that were in alone,
successively. After that, however,
the Tiger's offense sputtered un-
dér the constant checking of the
Panthers and‘ few of . their re-
maining shots on goal were much
of a threat to find the back of the
nets.

The Panthers will be in action
tonight at the Alpine Ice Chalet

at 11:30 p.m. against the Wash— '

led by Buzz DiGiavonni. who plays

2-0. this third contest should be
more of ’a real test of the Pan-
ther offense.

On the other hand. the Panthers
have perhaps one of the best blue
crews in the summer league.
With Duke Schaeffer. John Finney
and Kerry Browne all back from
the regular Pitt squad. the Pan-
thers boast a solid defensive unit
which may prove to be their
strongest point as the season pro-
gresses.

One problem that still faces the
Panthers is the lack of financial
backing. The team still does not
have a sponsor although there are
a few possible‘ candidates are be-
ing contacted. Each game costs
the skaters $43.75 but the team is
looking for enough financial sup-.
port only to purchase jerseys and
to pay for part of the ice fees.
