CMU computer center hailed, protested

Protesters
disrupt
ceremony

By John Zaphyr
Staff Writer

The government officials meeting
at Wednesday’s ground-breaking
ceremony for the new Software
Engineering Institute building were
greeted by some uninvited guests.
Protestors, armed with picket signs
and chanting for the funding of lives
and not the military, lined the roped-
in boundaries of the building site
and tried to make their presence
known.

The protestors were members
from the Carnegie-Mellon Univer-
sity Peace Alliance, The Thomas
Merton Center, The River City
Campaign, and the Performers and
Artists for Nuclear Disarmament.

“We’re not going to stop SE1,”
said CMU Peace Alliance member
Daniel Rosenblum, “but at least by
raising the level of consciousness, we
hope to reach the faculty at CMU so
they can try to control the goings-on
of the military."

The protesters, who were led by
CMU members, said they were not
against Carnegie-Mellon’s cooper-
ating with the military to build a
software installation, but they did
say they disagree with what might go
on there. _

“The SE1 program is supposed to
create methods to make program-
ming easier for computer operators,
and that is fine,” said Roscnblum.
“But the military will have some
control over what is being pro-
grammed, and some people will
have access to classiﬁed informa-
tion, and that is unacceptable in
acedemia."

According to CMU president Dr.
Richard M. Cyert, the handling of
classiﬁed material will be left to the
military. “We don’t expect to have
any classified research,” said Cyert.
“This is a project to improve produc-
tivity. No CMU staff member will be

allowed to work on anything
classiﬁed.” _

The protesters also believe that
the funds going into the software
project could be better spent else-
where. “I believe the government is
spending too much money on
defense,” said one protestor, “while
they’re ignoring other necessary pro-
grams that need funding.”

Director of Software Installation
Col. David Luke said that the cost of
the institute will be outweighed by
the benefits to the surrounding com-
munity. “The biggest effect of the
SE1 is going to be a bigger growth in
the community — even more so than
the military end," he said.,“When-
ever you establish a center of
growth, you’ll get a spin-off to the
private sector.”

Although possible benefits to the

community have been cited, the pro-
testors still said they do not agree
with the building of the center. “The
200-odd jobs that will be established
by the institute will not be filled by
people from this area,” said Rosen-
blum. “And even if they were, would
it still be worth it?” _

“If technology was going to be for
the advancement of the people, that
would be terriﬁc,” said Liz Hughes,
Consumer Party chairman. “The
military doesn’t seem to be going in
that direction, though.”

“The institute should be dedicated
to life —- not the military," said Eliza
Critchlow, a protestor bearing the
sign “To protest is to hope.” “Ger-
many was doing just this very thing
before the war, and you know what
happened there.”

while

demanding quality cadets

By Nancy Quick
Assistant News Editor

Pitt's Reserve Officers Training
Corps changed this year. Under the
leadership of Lieutenant Colonel
Donald Kirchoffner, professor of
military science, the organization is
striving to increase its visibility on
campus while demanding a high
standard of quality.

“Before Colonel Kirchoffner’s
plan was instituted last year, Pitt’s
ROTC program focused on quan-
tity, not quality,” said Captain
Bruce Hart, assistant professor of
military science. “Now we feel

responsible for maintaining a cer-
tain standard level for our cadets.
What used to be a two-year program

‘is now a four-year concept central-

izedron turning out good quality
officers."

“The Pitt ROTC program
improved across the board after the
establishment of Colonel Kir-
choffner‘s plan,“ Hart said.

Yesterday evening, for instance,
the cadets lowered the ﬂag outside
the Cathedral of Learning in a
ceremony that will become a regular
campus event. “We treat the ﬂag as a
living representation of the United
States," said Kim Smith, cadet com-
mand sergeant major. “Neither the
Army, Air Force nor ROTC have
ever taken this kind of responsibility
here before."

This year, the ROTC will be
involved in various other activities
around campus as part of a program
that will create more visibility for the
organization. _ .

“We're running .a platoon of

. . .,”-?'.T.'.‘.';;

cadets in the Great Race,” Smith
said. “We'll carry a guidon [ﬂag] and
sing jodies [chants] so as to draw
attention to ourselves as an
organization."

The drill team also tentatively
plans to perform precision marching
maneuvers with weapons at the
homecoming football game, and a
riﬂe marksmanship team is being
organized to compete with teams
from other universities.

“We do offer classes in riﬂe
marksmanship through the univer-
sity," Smith said. “A lot of people
don't know that. Trees Hall has a
riﬂe range used for that purpose. A
lot of people don't know that either.
We want to make people aware of
what ROTC is really about. They
don't know, and what they do see,
they don't take seriously.”

“The ROTC is in every movie,”

Groundbreaking held;

construction begins

By John Zaphyr
Staff Writer

A ground-breaking ceremony
Wednesday marked the beginning of
construction of the Software Engi-
neering Institute building at
Carnegie-Mellon University. The
$103 million Defense Department
computer ‘software development
project was awarded to CMU last
January following a national com-
petition.

“Having been awarded the SE1
gives us (CMU) the advantage we
need to be the foremost placefor
research of this,-kind in the world,
surpassing MIT and Stanford,” said
Dr. Richard Cyert, president of
Carnegie-Mellon.‘ '

Construction of the 152,000-
square-foot facility will begin Sept.
23 and is expected to be completed
by June 1987.

“1 think we’ll see the real benefits
of this institute coming in about four
years. As with any research, the
impact. comes a while down the
road,” said University of Pittsburgh
President Wesley Posvar.

The Regional Industrial Develop-
ment Corporation of Southwestern
Pennsylvania is responsible for the
construction and management’ of
the building, which is expected to
cost $18.5 million and will provide
‘office space "for more than 270
employees.

“SE1 is one of the most significant
new job growth opportunities to
enter the regional economy in a long
time,” said RIDC President Frank
Brooks Robinson.

Mayor Richard Caliguiri said he

conducted, ”

is optimistic that SE1 will spark the

Pittsburgh economy. “Pittsburgh's

economy can beneﬁt from this cen-
ter because it will attract computer
software ﬁrms to the area. They’ll
want to be where the latest advance-
ments in their ﬁeld are breaking,”

» said Caliguiri.

Cyert said he is confident that SE1
means jobs for Pittsburgh. “The
center will bring more jobs into
Pittsburgh.

The University of « '

Maryland, which was in the compe- '

tition for SE1, predicted that it
would bring 25,000 jobs to their
area,” said Cyert. _

Officials of SE1 said they hope
that the institute will earn: Pitts-
burgh the reputation of one of the
up-and-coming high-tech cities in
the nation.

“What this institute will do for
Pittsburgh is show off the engineer-
ing and technology that it has to

offer, but which has been left unno- ‘
ticed' outside of the city,” said.

Caliguiri.
Altliough SE1 was awarded to
CMU, both Cyert and Posvar said

they see Pitt's computer research_
benefiting from the project.

“It’s going to be to our advantage
having the research center right
down the street. It will be attractive

where research of this scale is being
said Posvar. Cyert
added, “We can work with Pitt in

software engineering by giving,

members of their departments
access to the center by doing joint
faculty work.”

“I’m proud of this accomplish-
ment made by our sister university,”
Posvar said. “This will really benefit
our high technology research.”

 The Pitt News - September 13, 1985

Around the World  

Parker accuses ex-teammates in drug trial

(UPI) — Reds star Dave Parker
has supported earlier testimony that
former Pittsburgh Pirate teammates
Willie.Stargell and Bill Madlock dis-
tributed amphetamines in the Pirate
clubhouse.

Parker testified yesterday during
re-direct examination at the trial in
Pittsburgh of Philadelphia caterer
Curtis Strong. He acknowledged
that he received the drugs from Star-
gel], the long-time inspirational
leader of the Pirates and currently
their first-base coach. He also
claimed to have received drugs from
Madlock, recently traded to the Los
Angeles Dodgers.

Drug
dealer arrested

(UPI) — A prosecutor in Connec-
ticut says authorities plan to arrest
the alleged ringleader of a cocaine-
smuggling scheme in 1983 and 1984
at one of the nation's most presti-
gious prep schools. U.S. attorney
Alan Nevas says cocaine use at Cho-

' ate Rosemary Hall in the city of

Wallingford was “very widespread.”
The late president John F. Kennedy
was among the exclusive school's
graduates.

Satellite tested

(UPI) — The first test of a‘U.S.
anti-satellite weapon against a satel-
lite target in space apparently will go
on without a court fight. A federal
judge in Washington said no to a bid
by four congressmen and the Union
of Concerned to delay the space test.
U.S. District Judge Norma Johnson
says the issue is “a political ques-
tion” that should not be determined
by the court. Published reports say
the test is set for noon today against
a U.S. satellite called Solwind.

Train crashes

(UPI) — Rail spokesmen are
blaming “human error” for the
deaths of at least 49 people in the
worst train disaster in Portugal’s his-

tory. Authorities say railway station
managers gave a green light to two
passenger trains at almost the exact
same time, sending them onto a sin-
gle track in opposite directions.
More than 150 people were hurt in
the crash some 200 miles north of
Lisbon. Earlier authorities said they’
feared the death toll would hit 300,
but today they say many bodies were
cut to pieces, making an exact death
count difficult.

Democrats
retaliate

(UPI) —— Democratic Senator
Edward Kennedy calls it “an abuse
of the Senate rules.” He’s talking
about yesterday’s Republican parlia-
mentary move that blocked any
further attempt to call up a bill for

.sanctions against South Africa. The

maneuver forced the Democrats to
scrap their direct challenge of Presi-
dent Reagan's limited sanctions.
Now. they’ll try to attach harsher
measures to other bills during“ this
legislative session.

AIDS ignorance

(UPI) — U.S. Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop says there is a problem
of public ignorance about AIDS and
he thinks the federal government
should try to solve it. Koop is dis-
turbed by the ﬁndings of a (New
York Times-CBS) poll that said
more than half the Americans ques-
tioned believe AIDS can be trans-
mitted by casual contact. Those

surveyed rank it with cancer and ‘

heart disease as the most serious
diseases.

Meanwhile, the attorhey of a 7-
year-old born with AIDS pleaded
with a New York State Supreme
Court justice yesterday to allow the
second-grader to remain in class.
Parents, in-the borough of_ Queens
are keeping some 10,000 children
out of schools in thefourth day of a
boycott because city school officials
allowed the AIDS-afﬂicted child to
attend school.

Student volunteers gain valuable

An introduction

By Kim Ingram
For The Pitt News

Are you a people person? Do you
enjoy teaching? Do your future
goals lie in the psychological or med-
ical fields? If your answer is yes to
any one of these questions, then a
volunteer position at the Western
Psychiatric Institute and Clinic may
be just the thing for you.

WPIC has a wide variety of volun-
teer positions in many ﬁelds open to
students. These include eight inpa-
tient units, two outpatient units,
tutoring programs and involvement
in child-related research. The volun-
teers interact with psychiatric

Pitt’s Department of Public
Safety is stepping up its efforts this
fall to educate students about crime
prevention on campus.

As part of the effort, the depart-
ment has begun a series of student
workshops which deal with specific
problems throughout the campus
and Oakland area.

This past Tuesday, Community
Relations Officer Sgt. Charles Grier
conducted the first session, which
was geared primarily for freshmen
and resident students, although oth-
ers were also welcome.

“It is the departments hope that.

all students and faculty would be
aware of the opportunities they have

of preventing crime on our campus, i

before it occurs,” said Grier.

 

ment with recreational planning.

According to Millie Sucov, the
director of the WPIC volunteer pro-
gram, volunteers enhance the effi-
ciency of the hospital. “The
volunteer students provide a vital
asset for the treatment of the
patient,” said Sucov. “By encourag-
ing a more friendly environment,
they help the patient to feel less
troubled by his or her own problem
and more accepted into the social
stream.”

In addition, a volunteer program
can enhance your resume. Sucov
emphasized that the volunteer pro-
grams work very favorably for the
studentiwith a future in clinical
psychology. V

“Real-life exposure is what psy-
chology is all about,” said Sucov.

“Most students are in a good posi-
tion to protect themselves,” Grier
said. “At the workshop we tried to
emphasize steps that can be taken to
lessen a person’s vulnerability to
crime. .

school, you need this exposure. "The
valuable experience gained from
first-hand observation of different
types of mental illness and their
treatment programs at one of the
largest university-based clinical,
educational and research institutes
in the United States is a plus for any

according to Sucov.

The volunteer options include
several programs. There are two
child inpatient programs, where
volunteers participate in activities

a shame that we have crime on our
campus, but it is reality,” he said.

At the workshop, UI'1CI' spoke in
length about the many simple steps
that can be taken to prevent crime.
He emphasized such things as the
locking of dormitory doors and pay-
ing close attention to one’s personal
valuables, which, he said, could dis-
courage thieves before they even get
a chance to strike. ‘

Grier singled out Trees Hall as a
“hot spot" for crime.

“In the past there have been a lot
of ripoffs in and around Trees Hall.
We suggest that cars not be parked
in the rear of that building, and that
students not place their valuables in
the locker room lockers.”

The many libraries of the univer-
sity were also a targeted area at the
workshop. Grier pointed out that it

' is in the library that many thefts

occur. ‘‘It is best _if_ students_ never

with the children, and inpatient pro-
grams concerned with schizophre-
nia, geriatric, mood-disorder and
depression treatment.

In the adolescent program, a
volunteer can be involved with
recreation or tutoring math, science
or foreign languages. Schizophrenia
and mental retardation outpatient
programs give the volunteer a
chance to help patients with com-
munity resources.

If you would like to teach, a liter-
acy program is provided for helping

leave their book bags and purses
lying on the library tables,” said
Grier. “That way thieves don’t have
a chance."

He also promoted what he termed
as the “buddy system" which means
to travel in groups. He said the
buddy system has been proven to
deter possible assailants.

“We now have a program called
Operation Crime Watch that gets
the student involved,” he said. “We
would like the students to be an
extension of the campus police.
That's not to say that we want them
to become physically involved, how-
ever, but we do encourage them to
be on the lookout for possible
crime.”

The subject of alcohol consump-
tion also was addressed by Grier at
the workshop. “We want the stu-
dents to realize the responsibilities
involved with drinking,” he said.

adults learn to read, and there is also
a tutoring program for children with
learning disabilities. In the research
field, there is work being done with
psychiatric disorders, particularly

sleep disturbances, depression and _ T '

schizophrenia.

The qualiﬁcations for the volun-
teer positionsrequire that you be at
least I8 years of age and in good
physical and emotional health. The
program begins with an interview
with the volunteer program supervi-
sor, and work requires approxi-
mately four hours per week. The
time may vary, though, depending
on the program. .

According to Sucov, WPIC has a
special need for volunteers during
the evening and weekends. This
could be the ideal situation for those
caught up in busy schedules during
weekdays. For more information
concerning the volunteer programs
or for an appointment, call 624-

Just because we’re on a college cam-
pus does not make usexempt from
state law. Students that are not 21
should not be drinking, and those
students that are of legal drinking

has plans of holding future semin-
ars, but at the present time no dates
have been selected.

Coke's not it  

A recent federal investigation has exposed an alarmingly
widespread use of cocaine within professional baseball. While
this case focuses almost exclusively on the narrow world of
baseball, we should bear in mind that the type of behavior
observed there may indeed mirror what is to be found in society
at large. ‘

Attorney General Ed Meese recently reported to a Senate

' committee that cocaine use in America is likely to remain high

in 1985, even though the use of marijuana and heroin will
decline. The federal government has been waging a war of sorts
against drug producers and suppliers alike, destroying crops
domestically and exerting diplomatic pressures on drug-
producing nations abroad. Unfortunately, although its inten-
tions are noble, its efforts seem a futile gesture.

Federal anti-drug efforts are not likely to be effective so long
as there is a consumer demand for cocaine and other drugs. So
what can be done to curb the demand? Some may suggest that
we educate our youth, making them aware of the dangers of

. drug abuse. But, as we’ve seen in the past, this course is doomed

to failure. Most of us have seen Reefer Madness and found it
hysterically funny. No, curiosity, peer-pressure and thrill-
seeking will continue to inﬂuence teenagers to experiment with
drugs, regardless of the dangers.

There is one possible solutionto this nagging problem, an
idea that has been overlooked and remains untested. If reality
could somehow be altered to make it less of a threat to individ-
ual security, then perhaps drug abuse could be eliminated, or at
least sharply curtailed. We could begin by outlawing boredom
and by making it a federal offense to exhibit unkind or threat-
ening behavior. Everyone could be required by law to be lov-
ing, understanding and patient, and warm embraces, food and
shelter could be guaranteed to all. Failing to appreciate beauty
and truth could be punishable by death. If these measures
should fail to produce a drug—free society, then it would proba-
bly be just as well to continue to indulge our excesses until we
are afflicted with the collective belief that Pete Rose (already
touted as immortal) is, in actuality, God, at which point our
condemnation would be assured.

Undergraduate teaching troubles

I have a class with a teacher who
cannot teach.

This professor is brilliant, but he
cannot explain the simplest of con-
cepts to his students. He comes from
another nation, probably recently,
because his ;_English is spoken in
choppy sentences, and his words are
often enunciated incorrectly. He
mumbles to himself during most of
the class, so I frequently can’t under-
stand what he is trying to get across
to his students. He scribbles his
notes in disorder on the blackboard,
so I do not know what they repres-
ent. I have gained little insight on the
subject of his class. ,

Students in this professor’s class
sit in the back row making obnox-
ious comments about the professor
or talk among themselves. Many
sleep. Others have dropped the class
because they lost interest in the class,
and the few of us who wantto learn
are frustrated because we have
learned nothing from him. We pry

answers from the textbookjust to_

prepare for the tests.

I have expressed my frustration
about this professor to my friends
and roommates. “Teachers like him
have been a problem for years,”they
tell me — apparently they have had
many similar professors at Pitt.
“Why have you tolerated it for so
long?” I ask. “Transfer to another
class,” they respond.

President Posvar was quoted in
The Pitt News as saying “No univer-
sity can claim to be great if it doesn't

_ have an international dimension. ”A

noble goal for the University of
Pittsburgh. But how is this univer-
sity to remain great if it cannot fully
educate its students, the fundamen-
tal task of any educational institu-
tion — the reason Pitt exists?

Should not Posvar’s priorities be to
insure the quality of education at his
university? What good is an interna-
tional reputation when the core‘ of
this university, its students, rot away
intellectually?

Finding the answers to this prob-
lem will not be easy, but they are
needed. The solutions for improving
the teaching of a professor or teach-

ing assistant may be complex and ’

controversial, but tolerating a class-
room where students are being
taught poorly should not be the
option chosen. I suggest some ideas:
First, a blue-ribbon committee
could be formed to discover the per-
centage of instructors who are poor
teachers, those who are somewhat
better but could still use improve-
ment in their teaching methods, and
those who teach well. This commit-
tee should determine how “good
teaching” should be defined —
somewhere along the lines of “the
ability to instill a sense of knowledge
and appreciation about a subject
being taught,” even though “teach-
ing” is a very difficult term to define
— and what measures can be taken
to improve an instructor's teaching
methods. Such a committee should
consist of members of the adminis-
tration, representatives of the Pitt’s
faculty, experts in the field of educa-
tion and students.
- Second, Pitt should encourage the
reviewing of an instructor's ability to
teach by students and member
faculty and make the instructor
aware of the quality of his teaching.
Ability to communicate and the
effectiveness of teaching methods
should be especially covered. Such
observations should be shared with
the instructor along with strong
recommendations to make changes

or improvements. Good teaching
should always be acknowledged and
rewarded.

Third, videotaping an instructor’s
lecture has already proven to be a
helpful method at other schools in
making an instructor aware of his
teaching methods. Pitt should look
into this and other methods of help-
ing an instructor realize his wea-
knesses and strengths in teaching.
The use of such equipment on a reg-

ular basis should be strongly
encouraged.
Fourth, the university should

offer classes, perhaps mandatory,
for improving instructors’ teaching
methods. For those - instructors
whose spoken English is still diffi-
cult to understand, language lessons
should be made available and
attendance strongly urged.

Fifth, and most controversial,
those instructors who contribute lit-
tle to the class because their teacliing
is so inadequate should be dropped
from all teaching responsibilities
and assigned elsewhere. Ifa working
person, for example, does not con-
tribute at all to his job, why should
he be employed in that position? Re-
moving a teacher from his class is a
drastic measure. It may also be the
most effective. "

Pitt is responsible for guarantee-
ing its students a quality education. I
worked hard to earn the money and
make the grades to come to school. I
deserve good teachers, as does every
student who attends this university.
With the national concern over the
American education crisis, would
not resolving the problem of
teachers who teach poorly be a step
in the right direction? Pitt’s reputa-
tion for offering quality education is
at stake.

Student credit cards are made available by Citibank

By Kelly I. Shaffer
Staff Writer

Students and credit cards. In most
cases this is a relationship that has
not been developed, yet one that
could make college life so much eas-

lCI'. /

Whether it isbeing able to rent a
car, to go home in an emergency,
purchasing an airline ticket, making
phone calls or shopping two days
before payday, having a credit card
would simplify the situation.

But it’s not easy for college stu-
dents to obtain a credit card. Little
or no income and the absenceof any
credit history make it almost impos-
sible for students to shop VISA-

_. style.

This situation is beginning to
change, however. -Citibank has
recently established a 24-hour, toll-
free College Credit Card Hotline to
make it— easier for a student to
acquire a MasterCard or Visa.

Citibank started a college credit-
card program three years ago
through the establishment of appli-
cation centers on college campuses.
The on-campus program and the
hotline were implemented in cooper-

‘ '~ation with the College Credit Card

Corporation. This Philadelphia-
based company-designs programs
and campaigns that enable large
credit companies to reach the.colle-
giate market.

“We are dealing with agroup of '

consumers that was virtually over-

  

.‘-x‘--'4 ,_ .‘ I ,

 

looked a few years ago," stated John
R. Post, vice president and director
of bankcard acquisitions for Cit-
ibank. The collegiate market
includes l2 million people and a col-
lective income in the area of $20

The collegiate market
includes 12 million peo-
ple and a collective
income in the area of $20
billion.

billion.

The student (who must be a jun-
ior, senior or graduate student)
initiates the process by calling a spe-
cial hotline number, where his name
and address are taken by an opera-.
tor who sends information and an
application. The hotline number is 1
(800) 824-4000, extension 421.

The guidelines for a student are
different from those of a normal
applicant. First, he must be a stu-
dent, full- or part-time. “This is to
show that he is making an invest-
ment in his future," explained

Michael Fromm of College Credit '

Card Corporation. The applicant
must also have a bank account.
“The student must also have some
form of income," he continued.
“This can be an allowance from his

parents or money earned from a pre-
vious summer job. Scholarships or
guaranteed future employment after
graduation is also sufficient. The
amount of money earned is not a
criterion; merely having a source of
income is the requirement,” he said.

“In order for a student to apply
for a credit card normally,«he would
have to have a bank account, a set
income and a credit history,”
explained Kathleen Cooper, a sales
representative ofThe Credit Bureau.

A person’s credit ‘history deter-
mines his credit rating. By beginning
and continuing to pay back a small
loan (or college loan) according to
its pre-determined repayment sche-
dule, a person initiates a favorable
credit history, and begins to acquire
a good credit rating. Credit card
companies usually don’t give credit
cards to anyone under the age of 17,
because they are minors and not
legally responsible for _debts
incurred.

Cooper suggests going to a large
department store to get your first
credit card, such as Sears or Hornes.
“They often have a student applica-
tions campaign. Mellon Bank will
send letters to card holders asking
them if their children want a card in
their own name, with a $500 limit,”
said Cooper. The cardholder is then
responsible for his own debts.

Through Citibank’s student

.hotline,_a student would not need a

credit history. .“A student usually
can’t receive a credit card unless he

has developed a credit history, but
one needs a credit card to establish
the history. It’s the original Catch
22," said Fromm.

Since it does not require a credit
history, many students can be con-
sidered eligible under the College
Credit Card Corporation’s plan.

Upon receiving the credit card
from Citibank, the student is treated
as a regular cardholder. If he abuses

his credit privileges or doesn’t pay

his bill, he will receive a series of
notices from Citibank. And if the
cardholder does not respond to the

Hart said. “We're the guys living in
the house next door in ‘Revenge of
the Nerds,’ but standards are chang-
ing. The army can assure a person an
occupation after college. The ROTC
program does not create Rambo-

type personalities. We’re more like‘

IBM — looking for quality people
who'll meet physical and mental
requirements. Military experience
has become a marketable item."

“As cadets, we symbolize the
Army," Smith explained. “ROTC
helps us to become officers and to
establish pride in ourselves. Even if
we decide to move 'on to a civilian
career, we’ll take with us the sense of
self we learned there.”

notices, Citibank will turn his name
over to a collection agency, and the
name goes onto a collection sheet.

“Any problems are listed and stay
listed for seven years. That’s seven
more years of bad credit,”according
to Kathleen Cooper.

Why is Citibank sponsoring the
hotline and trying to attract the col-
legiate market? According to
F-romm, the banks will have the bus-
iness and interest for three extra
years. They are hoping to make stu-
dents lifelong customers of
Citibank.

Today, the Army can afford to be
more selective because the improve-
ment of the ROTC programs makes
their offer more attractive to pros-
pective cadets.

“When I was in college in 1977,
nobody wanted to be in the Army,”
Hart explained. “ROTC wanted
people so badly, we didn’t care how
long your hair was or whether you
went to class or not. Now, we’re on
the other end of the spectrum. It’s a
market system, and we’ve got one of
the best deals going.”

“People may still look at ROTC
and say, ‘By God, ifl do that, l’ll end
up right next door to “Revenge of
the Nerds.” The people don’t see
the progressive organization that the
Army is.” '

 Dry heave!

Off-Forbes Festival stumbles off the blocks

By Carrie Stetler

The Pittsburgh Filmmakers’ Off-
Forbes Festival (three consecutive
weekends of performance art events)
opened last. Friday at the_,New City

Theat:'re'.Nwith'Drywall, a garb,lé_d"an_d~ '

‘ inflated’multi-meﬁa‘/piece’
, artist" Stephen.‘ Pellegri_no. -f"For

membe"'-rsof.-the;audience whodid not '

know what. "drywa'lling,” was, the '

I

playbi-I-I informed (us that-__it wasa
building construction _t_e'chniq,ue

. whereby a ”gypsum sheet’ rock is fin-

ished with a plastering process." This
bit of blue-collar labor was symboli-
cally re-enacted during the play to
create for the audience a ”historical
and anthropological context.”
Already skeptical about Pellegri-

no’s- need to explain his intentions in _

the playbill, I knew that I was in for
more oblique and weighty symbolism
when I attempted to find a seat on the
floor of the small and crowded New
City Theatre and was told by a stage-
hand, ”You can sit anywhere but in
front of the refrigerator.” A glance at
the playbill hinted that I was near no
or inary appliance but ‘ rather a
"Refrigeolith.” This turned out to be
one of the central metaphors of Dry-
wall, which persistently tries to make

analogies between ancient a"_'ndmod- _
, ern symbols and rituals. '

Within five rninutesof ‘the play’s

onset",-I discovered that its dialogue I

was as mystifying and heavy-handed
as the names for its" props’. Three
characters, the .Explainer (a gro-
tesquely made—up college professor),
th_e Taper (a construction worker)
and the Celtic Earth mother (a philo-

1bY‘loc.al'_  '

sophic barfly) each took turns making
confusing and impassioned solilo-
quies about various personal expe-
riences and social observations.

The "historical and anthropological

contextt‘ of Drywall was established ‘

I’

with references to popular culture.
The multi-media aspect of it con-
sisted of a screen showing slides of

ancient monoliths while the
Explainer (played by Richard Wad-
dingham) gave a lecture _on cultural
shapes" and symbols. A piano player
behind the screen provided an occa-
sional score while the actors ranted
with such painful. earnestness that
one almost, felt badfgrimacingat some
of their ‘more outstandingly awful
lines; '

Pellegrino was perhaps the best
performer of the three. He has a

great singing voice that was quite

moving when he moaned a sort of
mantra while being symbolically
crucified beneath a shape that he had
drywalled. His best moment, though,

5 , was his resurrection from the Refrig- _

'eol_it'h;' he burst from it singing Willie

_ D'ixon"s " Wang Dang ;Doodlé"j and .
‘ l kicking Tuppe{r_Wafe...out of his path.“
.M_ary _  Shea,_- the; Celtic Earth

A  mother, demonstrated all the embar-

'l lrassing sincerity and flourishes of a

high school thespian. A little tongue-I
in—cheek' would have greatly
improved lines like,l"I was slapped" in
the face by the Beatles. How could I
dance with another?”, spoken when
she was bitterly lamenting her
puberty. A

No one would accuse Pellegrino of
not being ambitious enough. He
attempted to say quite a lot with Dry-
wall, but the clumsy grandiosity of
this production sat ill on the rather
cliched and trivial revelations of its
characters. That Johnny Weismueller
grew old and became a businessman
in Florida may be unfortunate, but I
think it's one of life's little disillusion-
ments that can be accepted without
the rictus of agony it seemed to
inspire in the Taper. ”]ohnny, did you
really think you could save the world
from communism by ripping the guts
out of alligators?” he begged of the
dead film idol, .

American pop culture is indeed a
curious thing, and many would argue ..
‘that the feelings and rituals it inspires
are almost religious. A little more lev-
ity and the absence 'of'a Christ-figure
would have made Pellegrino’s thesis
more convincing.

Although it appears that the film
openly satirizes film noir seriousness
and Hollywood frivolity via black and
white cuts to_ Molina’s embellished
bedtime narrations, it too seems to
fall into the formula plot it criticizes.

Based on the novel by Manuel Puig,

fantasies only to keep peace, until the
two lives finally weave into one sym-
pathetic and sometimes pathetic web.

The main success of Spider Woman is
the development of these two charac-
ters. Arregui and Molina spend three
quarters of the film talking—and
talking about their realities and fan-
tasies. Their experiences evolve into
a believable relationship bringing
some interesting, if not unpredictable
results.

Quentin Crisp brings  

MANNERS I-‘ROM HEAVEN

(A DIVINE GUIDE TO GOOD
BEHAVIOR)

by Quentin Crisp '

Harper & Row

By Michael Fay

During the 1960s, this country
ushered in a new age, an age obsessed
with youth, youthfulness and any-
thing even remotely related to being
young. Such things as exercise, diet-
ing and trendy fashions gained

boundless acceptance. This is well.

and good, and the test of time will
undoubtedly find a solid niche for all
of them. However, says 70-year-old
Quentin Crisp in his book Mariners
From Heaven (/1 Divine Guide to Good
Behavior}, this age has also washed in
many bad habits of the young. This
book offers an argument in favor of
restoring maturity and ‘mutual
respect to their rightfully high lofts
in our society. Until society changes

its course, here are the hows and

whys of being well—mannered in a
rude world.

The point Crisp makes over and
over is that although it is nice to
reflect on the wonders of one’s
youth, it is best to leave it behind.
Youth, he says, more than anything,
is a period of ”constant self-centered
turmoil” and ”moral indigestion.”
That is something, he says, to which
the young are entitled, but it is a
phase that is best abandoned as soon
as possible. One should make a con-
scious effort, he says, to give those
around him respect, even if it's unde-
served. There is no excuse, says
Crisp, for confronting anyone with
the ugly ”truth,” even if one must lie
in order to avoid it.

In his own words: ,

”To say what we think to our
superiors would be inexpedient; to
say what we think to our equals
would be ill-mannered; and to say
what we think to our inferiors is
unkind  The lie is the basic building

"""""""—_"""'|

  
  
  

block of good manners.”

According to Crisp, ”The differ-
ence between a well-mannered per-
son who chooses not to react to every
human foible he encounters, and
someone who can't keep a bitchy
temperment under control, is not
that the former is unobservant, but
that he has achieved a certain mea-
sure of inner calm. He doesn't feel
compelled to build himself up by tear-
ing others down.” '

If it is starting to sound as if this
book is just one long lecture on self-
effacement and other forms of men-
tal masochism, it's not — really. His
strident cynicism is contrasted well
with a relentless wit and an underly-
ing sense of purpose. Actually it's
very amusing. The book is filled with
anecdotes from a flamboyant 70-
year—old homosexual’s point of view,
very much in the vein of Oscar Wilde.

observation.

Toward the end of the book, Lrisp 

tackles the subject of sex in relation
to good manners and fares quite well
(something Emily Post would cer-
tainly not have delved into). His con-
clusion about sex is that it is highly
overrated in this society, and that it
thus creates some absurd social situa-
tions. He suggests that parties not
interested in engaging in sexual
activity think ahead and avoid put-
ting themselves in a situation where.
even the subject might crop up.

This is a practical, funny and well-
conceived guide to manners in mod-
ern society. It is also, in Crisp’s case, _
the culmination of a life of observa-
tion and experience. The rub is this:
all of the self-effacement and under-
statement in keeping in touch with
the generation at hand is ultimately
self-serving. Manners, Crisp says,
are ”a means of getting what we want i

WIDE AWAKE IN AMERICA
U2
Island Records

When American radio stations
began recently to play cuts from an
import EP by U2, the group's fans in
the United States clamored for its
release. Island Records responded

. quickly with a slightly different ver-

sion of the import, released under the
title ”Wide Awake In America.” The
result is a listenable, though seriously
flawed, mini-album.

A live rendition of ”Bad” opens the
records. The calm, swaying verses of
the song gradually build into a driv-

. ing chorus. Vocalist Bono’s tense,

hypnotic vocals soar above the music.

recording, gives this version of ”Bad”
more impact than the song originally

‘had. However, the live version still

lacks the flair that the band eventu-
ally added to the song. The explana-
tory introduction and vocal
improvisations by Bono at the song's
mid-point, (which included excerpts
from ”Ruby Tuesday” and ”Walk On
The Wild Side" among others) that
were included later, provided
strength that is missing here.

The first side's other song proves
to be the EP’s strongest track. ”A Sort
Of Homecoming,” also live,. sounds
clean and engaging. Flowing guitar
picking replaces the plodding syn-'
thesizers of the thick, muddy studio
track. Also, Larry Mullen ]r.'s crisp
drumming and the bass lines of Adam

Clayton are given well—deserved

prominence in the live mix. Finally, -

Bono’s varied vocal lines and well-
timed dynamics make the song an
engaging anthem for peace through
community.

Side two provides the record's
worst failings with its ”outakes” from

”The Unforgettable Fire." ”Three

Sunrises” features verses filled with
noisy guitar ramblings by The Edge,
and is only partly redeemed by its
bright-sounding chorus. Even then,
the vocals sound thin and poorly sup-
ported by the music.

The slow, even ”Love Comes Tum-
bling” fares slightly better. The
instruments blend well, creating a
solemn mood for the vocals to work
within. But the song varies little and

expectations

never ends up going in any direction.
Had the band had more time to com-
plete side two’s songs, the pieces
might have become worthwhile.
With their incomplete sound, one
could easily see why these songs
never made it onto ”The Unforgetta-
ble Fire.”

”Wide Awake In America” does
have good moments, most notably
during ”A Sort Of Homecoming.”
But by hastily releasing the record,
what could have been a strong, acces-
sable work ends up sounding unfin-
ished. Island might be wiser to wait
for U2 to fully realize their recording
projects and not rush us filler in
between.

Once upon a time Yngwie 

MARCHING OUT
-9, Yngwie I. Malmsteen’s Rising Force
Polydor/Polygram

As I slept a vision came unto me.

Before me was laid a vast forest.
The rain had left a mist in the trees,
and as I found myself walking among
the tall black spires, I came upon the
Knight of Immaculate Death. And
unto me he spake: Follow, and to afar-off
land will I take thee, and there thou will find
strange and fantastic treasures beyond thy

k.,»‘},- wildestimaginings.

GT?’ He led me through a dark and terri-
ble glade filled with beasts of every
description. It was there that I did
battle with the Thing-With-Twenty-
Million-Eyes, and only by the
Hammer of the Gods did I emerge

Victoriously. The Knight of Immacu-

late Death smiled, and spake to me:

Thou hast done well. Thou shalt be richly
rewarded.

And before me appeared a maiden,
lovely and fair as the purest dew of
spring. Flaxen was her hair and like a
gentle waterfall to her shoulders did
it fall. Around her shone a radiance
like the Light of Heaven, and she
gazed upon me with a tranquil beauty
that smote mine heart in twain. Sud-
denly did she disappear, and the
Knight laughed. Poor fool! Dost thou
expect such treasure for the work of a lcnave?
Ha ha ha ha haaal.’

And I found myself catapulting
through time and dimension. Hur-
tling through space, I saw a light, far-

off and distant, and to that light wasI _

directed. The Knight laughed and
attacked me with his Sword of Doom.
But in the end did I prevail, and vic-
tory was mine.

The maiden appeared, and in her
hands held she a glowing box. To this
box came I, and opening it I saw that
there lay inside a Gift. With quaking
hands and heart did I pick up this Gift,
and I saw then that it was called,

Marching Out, by Yngwie]. Malsteen’s .

Rising Force. And I knew that it was
good. And I spake: Yea, though I walk
among the Apostles of Grace and bathe in the
Spring of Eternal Glory, here, here is the voice
of God. And I wept. '

Then I woke up and realized it was

just another wretched heavy metal ‘

album.

BY STEVE MORRISON

A great new song from a
couple of old pros, a lousy one
fr_om a defrocked teen icon and
a lot of stuff in between is what
we're dealing with this week.
After an exciting spring and
summer musically, we seem to
be winding down into a very
an-exciting autumn. There are
highlights, though.

A-ha: "Take On Me"

Though Iliked this song a great
dealat first; it has gotten old on me in
a hurry. A-ha is a troupe of pretty-
boy" Scandinavian synth noodlers
who seem to be banking on the
Duran Duran pre-adolescent market.
They have a bit more substance than

most synth bands, but only a bit. It's I

too soon to write them off, but ”Take
On Me,” while displaying the band's
talent to good advantage, does not
sound like the work of artists who are
going to go on to contribute anything
significant to the annals of rock—n—
roll. But they have their shot; that's
more than most bands get.

Ieff BecklRod Stewart: "People Get
Ready"

Given the negligible amount of
quality material that either of these
men have recorded during the last,
oh, 10 years, one would not expect

' much from their collaboration. I'm

happy to report, however, that the
first single from this new team is
wonderful. Stewart's voice sounds
better than ever before, and it has as
much real soul in it as any voice in
contemporary music that you care to
name, black or white. Beck's guitar
work is restrained but emotional, fit-
ting in somehow in what is essen-
tially a gospel song. If you're getting
tired of AOR vacuity, listen to this
song. It's good to hear inspired music
getting airplay.

The Affordable Floors: ”Walk Into the

Night"

Though not as yet available on
vinyl, heavy rotation on WPTS quali-
fies this song for review in this
column.

A slow, moody sort of minimalist
art-rock daydream, the Floors’ latest
release works as a result of a sus-
tained tension between the brooding
synthesizers, the bobbing funk bass
line, and vocalist Harvey Coblin’s
understated yet commanding vocals.
”Walk Into the Night” has a ghostly,
atmospheric texture not unlike Phil
Collins’ ”In the Air Tonight.” A solid
song from a promising band.

Eddie Murphy:l"Party All the Time"

Eddie Murphy is a talented guy. He
is a good comedian and a good comic
actor. He is no genius, however, no
matter what the trade papers say, and
he is also no singer. "Party All the

Time" was written, arranged, pro— —

duced, played, (yawn) and features a
vocal appearance by, none other than
funk-junk purveyor extraordinaire Rick
James. That means that the result is a
passable piece of glossy, state-of-the-
art urban ”soul,” though wholly
devoid of anything like joy or inspira-
tion. Murphy's voice is OK, if a bit
thin, but this song just isn't interest-
ing. So Eddie wanted to make a
record. Fine. So they let him. Fine.
But that doesn't mean I have to listen
to it.

Adam Ant: ”Viva Le Rock"

Kings of the Wild Frontier, Adam and
the Ants’ first record, was an absurd
collection of songs about Indians,
pirates and cowboys, but it managed
to be great nonetheless. By the time
Adam Ant went ”solo,” however, the
campiness of his songs had gone stale
— sour, even — and he became a

teen-idol farce. He then faded away A

gracefully.

Or so I thought. .

Now he's back with an awful single
that isn't half as good as even his lat-
ter music. Why he’s trying to make a
comeback at all, let alone with such a
lame song, is beyond me. For having a
contemptuous attitude toward his
audience, he's been docked a letter
grade.

best single he's had in a while. Until

Billy starts singing, the song is really‘

engaging, with a reggae-flavored
groove and crisp, clear production.
Unfortunately, the chorus is a big let-
down: it sounds like the verse andthe
chorus were written by two different
people. Where is this man's songwrit-
ing sensibility? This could have been
a terrific little tune. As it is, it gets
tired halfway through the second
verse. He's trying, admittedly, but a
wimp he remains.

Sting: "If You Love Somebody Set Them

Free" (extended mix)

I confess that I have a natural pre-
disposition against ”dance" mixes.
They can be entertaining if you're out
on the floor ”_feeling the beat” and not
really listening to the music, but most

often they take a good song and des— _I -I
troy it by changing around the struc-

ture and adding painfully

out—of-place instrumental sections,

echo effects and so on.

In the hands of dubmaster ”]eIly-
bean” Benitez, however, Sting’s hit is
transformed into a mesmerizing
showpiece of modern re—mixing tech-
nique. This is what's know as a "hot
mix." Even at eight minutes, it

doesn't get boring — it flows along --

without any one section going on too
long or seeming unnecessary. This is

a rare instance of an already-good —

song benefitting from a re-mix.
Still, though, it is a re-mix.

Orchestral

O.M.D.
Syria Mosque Ballroom
September 6, 1985

By Geoff Day and Mark
Daniels _

On Friday night, September 6, the
Syria Mosque Ballroom played host
to a band which is continually rede-
fining synth-pop music. Orchestral
Manoeuvres in the Dark delivered
their brand of heavy, symphonic
dance music to a record Mosque
crowd.

The set opened with the somewhat
somber sounding ”Crush" and the
”Native Daughters of the Golden
West,” two tracks from their latest_
album. As the concert became more

upbeat, it was apparent that lead
singer/ song writer, Andrew McClus-
key, was the focal point of their stage.

While the rest of the band

members — Paul I-lumphreys, Mar-
tin Cooper and Malcolm I-Iolmes —
were content to sit while playing,
McCluskey added a physical dimen-
sion to the performance by dancing

and stalking the stage like a true
showman. As one female teeny
bopper noted, "He's an incredible
dancer, and , like, I almost fainted
when he took off his shirt." But
McCluskey was far from the only one
whose feet were on fire; in fact, the
huge majority of O.M.D. fans danced
the night away.

This crowd not only danced along
with McCluskey ‘but also screamed
out a good majority of the lyrics, even
to some of the less familiar tunes. It
must be noted here that McCluskey
and the boys were impressed with the
Pittsburgh O.M.D. crowd, not neces-
sarily because of the uniqueness of

their response but by their intensity.’

Among the many high points of the
one—and-one—half hour set were
three of their more danceable tracks

— ”Secret,"' from the Crush album,

Culture.
It was with apprehension that we

went to see .this band perform live.  g
However, these initial fears were S’

quickly dispelled. Although their
sound is complex, they were able to
bring out the finer qualities of their
music without losing the polished
sound established on their albums.
Will O.M.D. be the Duran Duran
of the late '80s? Perhaps this kind of
mass appeal is not even what the
band is seeking. Who knows, but itis
our opinion that the potential for huge
success is certainly there, and that it
will take an aggressive sales effort for

their advanced sound to be accepted .

by the American mass market.

AC/ DC
Civic Arena

Sept. 10, 1985

AC/DC’s Fly on the Wall tour passed
through Pittsburgh on Tuesday, with
a 7:30 p.m. show at the Civic Arena.
The veteran heavy metal band turned
the volume up as high as it would go,
as lead guitarist Angus Young put on
an impressive show. Unfortunately
for the small crowd that turned out
though, lead singer Brian Johnson
left a bit to be desired.

By Michael Fay

On Thursday, Sept. 19, a group
representing rock ’n’ roll artists,
broadcasters and industry officials
will offer testimony before the
Senate Commerce Science and
Transportation Committee chaired
by Sen. Dan Forth (R-Mo.). The pur-

' pose of the testimony is to preclude

the Parent's Music Resource Center's
proposed standardized ratings for
records, tapes, videos and live perfor-
mances: Frank Zappa, the infamous
musician/composerlsatirist, will lead
the testimony. His work, needless to
say, will be cut out for him.

Why? Because the fact that a few
well-endowed and well-connected
people can introduce a piece of sub-
jective moral legislation and see

"Tickets at

the death of former lead vocalist Bon
Scott, either had a severe case of ton-
silitis, or he swallowed part of the
microphone. Throughout the con-
cert, fans had to guess what Johnson
was saying between songs. When he
was singing, it was even worse.
Ironically, though, the concert
turned out pretty well. The perform-
ance began with a weak version of the
title track off their new album, ”Fly
on the Wall." The crowd remained
sedate until a version of ”You Shook
Me all Night Long” brought them

way

back to life.

Young took center stage for the
rest of the concert, and the fans were
ever so appreciative. Young electri-
fied the crowd through versions of
"Highway to Hell,” ”Whole lotta
Roses” and ”TNT.”

The band ventured back to the days
of Bon Scott several times, but unfor-
tunately, Scott was not there to sing.
Johnson simply is not Scott and never
will be.

AC/DC had two high powered
albums following the death of Scott,

down

and should stick to them in concert.
Both ”Back in Black” and ”For Those
About To Rock, We Salute You” were

successful albums with Johnson at -

the microphone. ACIDC should stick
to these albums in concert because
Johnson's attempting to sing Bon
Scott's versions of AC/DC tracks is
not only an insult to the fans, but an

L insult to Scott.

What the Parent's Music Resource

that the vile rantings and gyrations of
Madonna and Motley Crue, like por-

legislation. Projecting their fears and
anxieties‘ about their children's moral
standing onto a piece of paper is going
to do nothing but irritate the situa-
tion. Anyway, as they should know
even these days, artistic oppression is
tacky. ,

If the "parents” really want to help
their children, perhaps they'd be bet-
ter off listening to the music they like
and to their problems and fears and
deal with them on a more intellectual
level, to stimulate thought and to
work out with them a set of real
values that will transcend the whole
issue.

Pitt defense holds the k
Ohio State

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

When a football team loses a
player who accounted for 47 percent
of the team’s total offensive output.
during the previous season, it is
bound to have an effect. That is the
case with the Ohio State Buckeyes.
The kind of effect, positive .or nega-
tive, remains to be seen.

We are referring to, of course,
Buckeye All-America running back
Keith yars, who is out with. a
broken. bone in his right foot. No
one really knows what will happen
when Ohio State takes the field
against Pitt this Saturday night in
the Buckeyes’ season opener, but
one thing is for sure: Byars will not
dress for the game.

“What can you say?” asked Ohio
State‘ head coach Earle Bruce. “He
was the leading rusher last year in
the country, he was the leading all-
purpose runner, the leading scorer,
the leading pass receiver on our foot-
ball team, and obviously, he's a great
football -player. Keith was having a
great fall camp. He was setting the
tempo for us. We will miss his play,
and we will miss his leadership.”

Now the burden shifts onto the
shoulders of 5-11, I90-lb. .junior
John Wooldridge. Wooldridge saw
considerable action as Byars’
backup last season and even aver-
aged ‘more yards per carry than
Byars, but he now faces the position
of focal point of the Buckeye attack.

“I’ve always wanted to be a star-
ter, but I didn’t want it to happen
this way,” said Wooldridge, who is
well aware of the task at hand. “I
have to be the best football player I
have ever been until Keith gets
back.”

One of Wooldridge’s biggest
advocates is Byars himself. Byars, a
Heisman Trophy candidate, said,
“[Wooldridge] could start for any
other team in the country.”

Bruce added, “He is a great tail-
back in his own right.”

So that poses the question: What
kind of game plan will Ohio State
attemptto utilize against Pitt? Will
Bruce stick to the same type of game
plan that took the Buckeyes to their
13th consecutive bowl game last
year, or will he switch and attempt to
mix it up more?

The Buckeyes have the capability
to mix it up, with talented people at
all the skilled positions. Junior quar-
terback Jim Kartsatos went unde-
feated in two starts as a fill-in starter
when Mike Tomczak was injured
last year. His receivers, including

The Pitt women’s tennis team
opens its 1985 campaign this after-
noon with a home match.against
Carnegie-Mellon. The Panthers will
send a veteran lineup to face the vis-
iting Tartans.

Returning from last year’s 9-5 Pitt
team are Carrie deVera, Colleen
Driscoll and Julie Gress. In l984’s
opening match with CMU, Pitt
eased its way into a 7-2 win. That
match was held at CMU.

George Deiffenbach is set to open
his fifth season as Panther head
coach. Deiffenbach said of this
year's schedule: “We'll want to get
off to a fast start, build up steadily

do from what they did last year,”
explained Fazio. “He was going to
run the ball 40 times a game, so he
was a pretty good guy to key on.
Now, with him not in there, I still
think their tailback is going to carry
the ball 30 times.” He added, “How
much passing they are going to do,
or how many different formations
they will use, we are not quite sure.”

So it will be up to the Pitt defense,
a unit that yielded 464 yards in total
offense against Purdue in the season
opener, to sustain the Ohio State
offensive attack.

“[The Panthers] are a very physi-
cal, defensive football team," said

Bruce. “They seem to attack the line i ‘V

of scrimmage and dominate it.”'

Commenting on the personnel on ,  

the Pitt defense, he added,“When I‘;

looked at Bill Sapio, I saw afine‘-.

Johnson and Dennis Atiyeh. I think  

they were tested tremendously in the

Aslsee it

 

By Jim Bruec'kner 

Pete Rose sets the standard for how baseball should be played

On Aug. 21 of this year, Pete Rose
and his Cincinnati Reds were at
Three Rivers Stadium playing ‘the
Pittsburgh Pirates. In that game,
Rose showed why he will go down in
baseball history. It wasn’t because
he banged out his 4l78th career base
hit en route to breaking Ty Cobb's
record. It wasn’t even because he
once again placed his team’s
accomplishments above his own by
deliberately hitting an easy ground
ball to the right side of the inﬁeld —
although it brieﬂy prolonged his
assault on Cobb's record, it enabled
a man on third to score a run.

No, what Rose did on that night
has probably already been forgotten
by most of the fans in attendance
that night. Except me. Allow me to
take you there to witness baseball
the way that it was meant to be

_ played:

It is the bottom of the seventh
inning. The Reds are leading the
Pirates by a score of 6-3. The Pirates
have not been/a comeback team in

recent times. {The Pirates’ Denny

Gonzalez is at the plate. The count is
two and two. There is nobody out,
nobody on base. Gonzalez hits a pop
foul near the Pirates’ dugout. It
looks like it's going to come down in
the crowd. -But Rose isn’t taking any
chances. He explodes from his posi-
tion at first base, running full speed
after a seemingly meaningless foul
pop-up. If the ball is not caught (and
odds are. it won’t be), then the Reds
will still have what seems to be a safe

three-run lead. But Rose is giving
chase, nearer and nearer to the
dugout, which is always a danger
zone for fielders. There is only one
player who, so near to breaking such
a monumental record, would risk
injury in this fashion. An injury
could delay breaking the record
indefinitely — maybe permanently.
With nothing but helping his team
win a game in his mind, Rose crashes
full ‘force into a waist-high fence
near the end of the Pirates’ dugout
and ﬂips headfirst onto the ground
below. A hush falls over the crowd.
Could this be the end for Pete Rose?
The seconds seem like minutes. Will
he get up? Can a 44-year-old man
withstand a blow that could put a
man half his age on the disabled list?
Who could possibly accuse him of
mere hanging around to break the
record? Rose knows only one
record, his team’s won-lost record.

Just then, Rose springs back onto
the playing field with the bounce of a
22-year-old rookie. As if nothing
had happened. A great career might
have come to an end over that foul
pop fly. But such is the incredible
intensity of Pete Rose. His will to
win is unmatched. His only thought
was probably one of disgust over not
catching the ball.

Rose has always placed team
accomplishments over his personal
accomplishments. That has never
been more in evidence than this year.
Despite the fact that he was chasing
Cobb’s record, Rose always started

Tony Perez ahead of himself against

a left-handed starting pitcher.

because Perez has a better batting
average against lefties than Rose.
Even when he had tied Cobb and
was one hit away from breaking the
record, Rose would not make an
exception. How many others would
have done the same? I'll give you a
hint. It’s the same number of people
that we've landed on Mars.

The number of records. that Rose
holds is astronomical. He holds
records for a career, for a season and
some for streaks. But the one that
Rose has said he is most proud of is
that he has been on the winning side
of more games than any one in
history.

One win that will be long remem-
bered by Rose and others was the
seventh and deciding game of the
1975 (what some call the best ever)
World Series. For that series, Rose
was named the MVP. The single
most remembered play of that series
will always be the extra-inning home
run by Carlton Fisk as he bounced
down the first base line waving for
the ball to stay fair. But it was Rose
doing the little things that win

games.

He won the MVP based on his
usual hitting in the clutch, but it was
one play late in game seven that I
will always remember.

With the Red Sox leading, the
Reds were batting with one out and
Rose on first base. A routine double-
play ball was hit in the inﬁeld. Rou-
tine, until you figure in the Rose

factor. Pete Rose, in typical fashion,
barrelled into second base and broke
up the double play. This enabled the
Reds to put together a two-out rally
that put them in the lead to stay.

That is vintage Pete Rose.’ He
does all the little things that go
unnoticed. Rose knows the game
better than anyone. Perhaps that’s
why he has beccme such a good
manager in such a short time. This is
probably his most overlooked
achievement. All the attention has
been focused on his records. But he
has taken a team that was a fixture in
last place, and has, in one year (less,
actually), turned it into a contender.
If the Reds continue at the rate they
are going, they should be the favor-
ites to win the Western Division next
year. Who knows? There might still
be time for a miracle finish this year.

One reason that Rose can never be
counted out is, as his nickname says,
he’s Charlie Hustle. There has never
been a more appropriate nickname
for an athlete than Charlie Hustle
for Pete Rose. No player in history
has put more effort into the game
than Rose.

Who played the game better than
anyone is an argument that will go
on forever. There are so many crite-
ria by which to judge the greatest
baseball player of all time that there
may be no true answer. Babe Ruth,
Willie Mays, Roberto Clemente,
Josh Gibson and of course, Ty Cobb
and Rose are generally considered
the leading candidates. But there are

those who might argue in behalf of
someone else.

Many people argue that Rose's —

breaking Cobb's record is invalid,
because Rose has had more at—bats'
and has had the advantage of play-
ing on an artiﬁcial surface, which
permits more hits on groundballs.
But Cobb had sufficiently more
advantages that are rarely discussed.

Cobb never had to deal with relief ‘
pitchers. I wonder how many hits E

Cobb got off pitchers in late innings
when their arms were ready to fall
off. Rose, when a pitcher got tired,

has had to face the likes of a fresh -

Rich Gossage or Bruce Sutter. What

about the fact that players are

scouted? Now, when Rose comes up,
the players shift to where he usually
hits. In Cobb's day, once the pitcher
had a count of two or three balls,
Cobb could sit on a fast ball, while
today pitchers have the control to
throw any pitch on any count.

The most crucial of the changes in
pitching is the development of the
screwball (which most pitchers can
throw) and the deadly split-fingered
fastball. Cobb never had to deal with

any pitch as bafﬂing as these two. If .

he had, who knows just how many
hits he would have gotten?

Like I said, it's next to impossible.

to pick out the greatest player of all
time. But if I were starting my own
team and could have any one player
in the history of baseball with whom
I could start my team, I would select
Peter Edward Rose.

The Pitt soccer team raised its
record to 2-0 by defeating Mercy-
hurst Wednesday evening by a score
of 1-0. Victor Hugo scored the lone
goal of the game, a rocket shot from
about 10 yards out on the left side of
the goal.

“Victor scored a great goal that
got as fired up," said Panther head
coach Joe Luxbacher.

Panther goalie Dave Torrence
finally broke the school record for
shutouts with his performance
against Mercyhurst. Torrence
recorded the 15th shutout of his
career and broke the previous record
of 14, held by Frank Bucci.

The Panthers are "ranked 10th in
the region, and Mercyhurst came
into the game ﬁred up for an upset.
“It was a hard-fought game," said
Luxbacher, “but neither team could
play pretty because both teams
played tough defense.”

The Panthers will host Slippery
Rock tomorrow afternoon at Pitt
Stadium. Game time is 1:30.

  Tennis
continued from page 19

Most people have at one time or
another come in contact with the
sport of tennis. Most have, if not
played the game themselves, at least
seen a professional match on TV.
And most have probably been dazed
and confused by the scoring used by
the pros. Well, the scoring is a little
easier in college tennis —— sort of.

A college tennis match is actually
composed of nine matches. There
are six singles matches (played con-
currently) and three doubles
matches (played after the singles
matches are completed).

The scoring within each match is
done either one of two ways. A pro
scoring system can be used — that is,
four points equal one game, and the
first person to win six games in a set
wins the set (provided there are no
tiebreakers needed, but that is
another whole story). The other
scoring system, a kind of tennis
shorthand, is to do away with the
idea of points within a game. That is,
to play simply 1-2-3-4-5 rather than
15-30-40-l game, 15-30-40-2 game,
etc. This shorthand is used in college
with the agreement of both coaches
and is often necessary in late season
matches when dusk comes earlier.
