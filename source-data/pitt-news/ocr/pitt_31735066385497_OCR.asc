The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization has been a
stabilizing political and military
force in Western Europe since its
creation in 1949. Manfred Worner,
NATO’s secretary-general,
believes that the alliance will
become more important than ever
with the reforms taking place in
Eastern Europe.

On Friday, Worner was at the
Westin William Penn Hotel in
Pittsburgh, where he gave a
speech deﬁning the organization’s
role as it heads into the 1990’s.

“The dominant role of NATO
today is to keep stability for the
process of change,” he said. “But
a more important role is stopping

” Soviet expansion, which we have

been successful so far.

“NATO is a stabilizing force in
the region and must continue {to
do be]. It must survive for the
stability of Western Europe.”

According to Worner, the Soviet
Union actually wants the United
States to stay in Europe. “[Soviet

Foreign Minister Eduard]
Shevardnadze, when he visited
me in Brussels, [Belgium] said
that he wants to keep U.S. troops
in Western Europe to help
stabilize the region,” he said.

With the growing tide of
democracy in both Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union,
Worner attacked communism and
proclaimed its
“Lithuania, the Ukraine, and
[Soviet Republic] Georgia are in
turmoil,” he said. “It is an example
that communism is a failure. The
system is in almost total disarray,
and it has lost its competitiveness.”

But he then warned the crowd
of becoming too complacent.
“The Soviet Union is still a big
military force in the area,” Worner
said. “We cannot let them use
their military power to defeat us.
We must make them understand
that military intervention is
senseless and useless.”

Worner expects that a new
SALT treaty will  hammered
out by the end of the year. He
said that approximately 100,000

On yesterday’s anniversary
of Roe U. Wade,‘ pro—choice
advocates linked hands from
the state office building,
downtown, to the headquarters
of the Pittsburgh Catholic
Diocese to symbolize the need
to separate church and state
on the Pennsylvania abortion
issue.

Flo Gaskill, a pro-choice
activist, explained the
significance of the chain. “The
general tone was to emphasize
the need to separate the
domination that the Catholic
Church seems to have over the

Casey,” she said. “We all linked
hands in a chain to symbolize
that connection. We have to
break that chain.”

Some supporters who
participated in the evening rally
carried signs that read,
“Governor Casey is a Papal
puppet”, and “We don't need

building on Liberty Avenue to
the Wood StreetYWCA, where
several local women leaders
gave short presentations.

Debbie Gould, president of
Pitt’s Campus Women’s
Organization, spoke regarding
the role that students have in
the abortion issue.

“Students have grown up
under the protection of Roe v.
Wade. We have never had to
face the tragedy of a friend
dying from a back-alley
abortion, but women can no
longer be complacent,” she
said.

The 1973 Roe v. Wade
Supreme Court decision gave
the mother the right to
terminate a pregnancy during
the first trimester after
conception.

Gould said that students
have an obligation as the
nation’s future leaders to speak
out on this issue.

“We have been taught that
this nation is based on freedom
and that includes freedom of
choice," she said. “Not only
are the so—called pro-lifers

Lead exposure harmful to children

By Sandy Paul
For The Pitt News

A study done by a University of
Pittsburgh professor of medicine
concludes that low-level lead
exposure in children has long-
lasting, damaging effects.

Dr. Herbert Needleman,
professor of psychiatry and
associate professor of pediatrics,
Harvard
University and the Children’s
Hospital of Boston have
completed an unprecedented 11-
year study of 132 children from
the Somerville and Chelsea, Mass.,
areas. The children were
originally studied in 1979 as ﬁfth
and sixth graders.

“This study tells us for the first
time that the effects of low-level
lead exposure in children are
permanent, and that they have a
profound effect into adulthood,”
said Needleman.

Needleman and his colleagues
report that lead significantly and
seriously impairs life, specifically
a sevenfold increase in failure to
graduate from high school, lower
class standing, greater
absenteeism and reading skills
that are two grades below
average. In addition, the young
adults in the study have
vocabulary deﬁcits, poor motor
skills, slower reaction times and
weaker hand-eye coordination. A

Children, whose central-
nervous systems are still
developing, are most susceptible
to lead poisoning.

In 1979, research conducted
by Needleman and his colleagues
related low-level lead exposure
to deficits in IQ, speech and
language skills and attention span.
These findings precipitated the
removal of lead from the nation’s
gasoline and tighter restrictions
on lead in paint products.

“Many people assume that with
the lead—paint law, which now
prohibits lead in household paint,

houses are no longer dangerous,”

said Needleman.

Seminar outlines aid strategies

By Jacinta Dvorak
Staff Writer

Questions concerning student financial aid were
answered last night at the Financial Aid Seminar in
the David Lawrence Auditorium, which was
sponsored by the Offices of Admissions and
Financial Aid and the Student Government Board.

“We’ve never done this before,” said Sandy
Bishop, a ﬁnancial aid counselor with the Office of
Financial Aid. “This seminar gives students some
background on financial aid.”

Bishop started the seminar with a brief
presentation, which highlighted some important
points students should be aware of when applying
for aid.

“Maybe a divorce or a death can change a
family’s income,” said Bishop. “This change must
be documented.

“We have no individual applications here, but we
do tell students how to fill them out,” Bishop said.
Things Bishop said that students should remember
when applying for aid included:
0 FAF, FAS and Tax Forms from the student and
parents should be completed. These forms are due
April 2, 1990.
0 Keep copies of all financial records.
0 Read all the information that is sent from
university and government aid offices.
0 If any information is unclear or not understood,
setup an appointment with a ﬁnancial aid counselor.
0 Be accurate with all information. Make sure that
any change of family income is documented.
- Student loans take 60 to 90 days to process. Plan
now for the 1990-91 school year.
0 Students should check their own backgrounds to
see if any other sources of financial aid are available.

The 41st annual National
Hockey League All—Star game was

12-7. But for Pitt sorority and
fraternity members, the most
exciting part was not the score
but the fact that they were chosen
to assist the NHL associates.
The Panhellenic Association
and Inter-Fraternity Council were
chosen to work with the NHL
Weekend because Drue Carney,
project manager of Del Wilber
and Associates, had heard of the
community service that the Pitt

I Greek system is involved in. Del

Wilber and Associates is a sports-
management firm that handles
mostly NHL contracts. They also

place over the All-Star weekend.

“They are the fastest growing
sports-management firm, ”
according to Xana Smith, internal
vice president of the Panhellenic
Association. Because of the work
that Smith did to coordinate this

hockey weekend, she received.

an internship from the company.

“Basically, he [Carneyl was
looking for a group of 25 to 30
girls who could be hostesses.
They would greet [the players] at
the airport and be involved in
other guest services,” said Smith.

Some of the other services that
the Greeks were involved in
included assisting with baggage,
coordinating transportation,
running errands, working the
information booth and being on
call to drive those associated with
the NHL around‘ the city.

The number of people involved
grew quickly. By the time the
project was underway, about 100
people were involved.

“We were very excited. It turned
into a large project. Not only is it
excellent job experience, it’s also
very good [public relations] for
the Greek system,” said Smith.
“There was a real enthusiastic
response. I was getting calls in
the middle of the night and being
attacked on the street by people
to see if they could become
involved.” 8 —

The most enjoyable part of th
whole event for the Greeks was
being surrounded by hockey
players. “There were players

everywhere,” according to Smith-

“The NHL employs friendly
people. The weekend went
excellently. It was very enjoyable.”

r Careers for the 90’s...

Job outlook unpredictable as new decade commences

By Diane Wolf
Staff Writer

Forget about the surveys and
T op-10 lists. The hottest careers
of the 1990s are unpredictable,
according to university placement
and career counselors.

“The days of passively choosing
a career from a list [of jobs] that
looks’ good are over,” said Marti

_ Moore, coordinator of A career

counseling at Pitt’s counseling
and student development center.
“People are going to have to
become their own career -
development experts.”

_ Robert Perkoski, associate
director of the University
Placement Service, believes

changes in today’s job market
make the best opportunities of
the future uncertain. ‘V

“A blurring of the lines is
occurring between careers,”
Perkoski said. “For example,
people with good communication
and writing skills can’t be put
into niches, but will be able to
use their skills for a variety of
jobs.” W

But keeping in mind that there
are no sure-fire keys to success,
several career areas are good
bets for the next decade.

With an aging population and
constant advances in technology,
careers in health and the health-
related professions look very
promising. “We’ve seen an
increase in health-related services
in the last 10 years, and that trend

is going to continue — no

question about it,” Perkoski said.

According to Dr. Pamela
Hepple, assistant dean for student
affairs at Pitt’s School of Nursing,

growth make nursing an attractive
career for the future. Nursing

vehicles would be destroyed,‘
including some 30,000 tanks. “If
you pu.t those ‘tanks end to end,
they would make a line from
Paris to Bonn,” he said.

Another
addressed was the reunification

of Germany. Worner, who was’
born "in Stuttgart, and was the

West German minister of defense

before he took over as secretary- »

general, said that he supported a
united Germany. “The people in
Germany should be allowed to
chose what's best for them,” he
said. ~

“The Soviet Union is jealous of
us,” Worner said. “We have a
stable alliance, and they don't. In
fact, they have said that ours is
the best stabilizer in Europe.” He
also said that the Japanese look
towards NATO as a stabilizing
force of the world.

“The people of Eastern Europe
are discovering the true meaning
of freedom, one that the West has
never known,” Worner said.
“People who have never lived
under a dictatorship do not know

‘ what it means to be free.”

of Labor Statistics’ list of
occupations with the largest
growth by the year 2000.

“What that means in terms of
career opportunities,” Hepple
said, “is that nurses with a four-
year degree can go just about
anywhere in the country and be
in demand.”

Opportunities in dental
medicine and pharmacy also are
expected to increase, but the less-
publicized careers in the health-

related professions, such as
‘physical and_ occupational
therapy, health records
administration, medical

technology and clinical dietetics
and nutrition, may be the real
gold mines for job-seekers.
According to data from the

The great demand for medical
technologists also is expected to
continue in the next few decades.
Career opportunities in other

a rash of retirements and a
shortage of younger professors
will open the doors to the halls of

“virtually closed for the past 15

Measles is a very contagious disease, spread by
coughing and sneezing. The early symptoms
appear approximately 10 days after infection.
These symptoms are fever, cough, and eye
irritation or sensitivity. About 3 days later, the rash
begins to develop. It usually appears behind the
ears first, then progresses to the face and body. If
this happens, stay at home and call the Student

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Tuesday, January 23, 1990

Liberal arts majors predicted to be in demand in 1990's

By Sandy Paul
For The Pitt News

Many liberal-arts majors
wonder what they will be able to
do with their degree in the 19905.

. The most popular answer to this

question seems to be: Anything!

Yet it is the openeended quality
of the ﬁeld of liberal arts that
proves to be both its strength and
its weakness.

Robert Hopkins, director of the
University of Pittsburgh’s
Placement Service, describes
liberal-arts majors as “non—tech”
and lacking a direct career focus.
Majors such as political science,
English, philosophy, liberal
studies and chemistry fit into this
category.

Instead of risking uncertainty,
many students opt for
professional or technical majors.
The demand for engineers,
accountants and computer
programmers can be very
appealing to a student dreaming
of success.

However, according to
Hopkins, liberal—arts majors are
at no real disadvantage when
searching for a job.

“There is a misdirection that
occurs when people look at the
career opportunities in terms of
the first job out of college,” said
Hopkins. “[Studies show] their
successes and achievements are

sex education and they want to
cut off funding to poor women
who have children to support.

“They want to turn women into
nothing more than baby
machines,” she said,

Dr. Barbara Shore, a professor
in Pitt’s Graduate School of Social
Work, spoke on behalf of the
Pittsburgh Coordinating
Committee of Jewish
Organizations for Reproductive
Freedom.

“They’ve gone too far and it is
now up to us to take the energy
that we have now and try to turn
this around,” she said.

Shore said that the recent
Supreme Court decision, which
gave leeway to the new
Pennsylvania state laws limiting
abortions, has had a tremendous
impact on religious freedom. “We
are offended when people say
‘you can’t make your own choice’.
This is an issue that a religious
woman has to decide on her
own,” she said. '

Shore said that the pro-life
advocates often try to make pro-
choicers look as if they are anti-
family.

“We love children and that’s
why we know that children have
to be wanted, supported and
cherished,” she said.

John Lugo of Bethel Park
attended the rally with his three
young children.

“I am for family. Wexall are. But
we are for a family by choice.
That’s why I brought my kids
here today,” he said.

Shore repeated a recurring
slogan of the rally at the end of
her speech when she said, “We
will prevail..’’

at least as good and sometimes
surpass those of their
professionally or technically
trained colleagues.”

Unfortunately, it takes more
effort for the liberal—arts graduate
to get his or her first job after
college than it takes for a
professionally or technically
trained graduate. More planning
and job searching need to be
done because as little as 35 to 40
percent of the on—campus
recruiters hire liberal—arts majors,
as opposed to the 60 to 65 percent
of recruiters who hire technical
majors.

Hopkins emphasizes, though,
that the ratio of technical and
professional recruiters to liberal—
arts recruiters does not represent
the reality of the job market.

“There may be four, five, eight or
10 jobs that do not require a
technical background for every
one that does,” he said. “But non-
technical students are not
recruited in the same way, and
that’s the imbalance that appears.”

Despite their seemingly foggy
paths to the future, liberal—arts
majors are essentially limitless in
their career possibilities. “But not
being limited is scary and
threatening,” Hopkins said.

The jobs are out there for the
liberal—arts major; they just have
to be found. According to
Hopkins, the key to finding a job
is that a student studying in the
liberal arts has to decide at some
point what it is he wants to do.
Hopkins suggests visiting Career
Counseling on campus to “start

weeding through those
opportunities that fit and those
that don’t.”

Also, gaining experience in a
part-time job, internship or other
opportunity, in addition to the
academic work, is important.
Lastly, the placement center,
though limited in on—campus
recruiting possibilities for liberal-
arts majors, can help students
devise a job-search strategy for a
specific field of work.

A few of the ﬁelds that hold
jobs for liberal—arts majors include
health and welfare, social-secu rity
administration, government,
sales, public relations,
management, the media,
advertising and customer service.
Also, a liberal-arts major is an
ideal preparation for a graduate

5

program in education, law,
business or medicine.

Hank Lerner, a junior at Pitt, is
a liberal-studies major who plans
to attend law school upon
graduation.

“I chose liberal studies because
it’s a good preparation for law
school. Also, it gives me the
chance to take the courses I’m
interested in instead of following
the requirements of a specific
major,” he said.

Other liberal—arts students are
not so sure of the future their
current major holds. Juliana
Ratkiewicz, a senior theatre-arts
major, said, “I tried a few more
practical majors — business and
pre—med —— and although I feel I
could have achieved in them

W/ben tbe stno/ee clears 

Last Friday District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry was
arraigned on federal narcotics charges. FBI, agents and
Washington, D.C. Police videotaped the mayor and a
female acquaintance smoking crack cocaine — which he
had purchased earlier from a friend.

Along with the fact that this now proves something that

’ ‘most of America already assumed — that the mayor of our

nation’s capital smokes crack — this episode also brings
the Jesse Jackson factor back into the D.C. spotlight. Will
Jackson now decide to run for mayor of D.C.? 2
Jackson has" previously considered running for mayor.
The only thing that has stopped him is the upcoming 1992
presidential race, which he couldn’t dedicate as much

time to if he were the mayor of D.C. He had a very good 1

chance ofwinning the office before Barry’s arraignment,
now he could probably walk in.
But the mayoral position of D.C. won’t be an easy one.

‘Barry’s legacy for our nation’s capital includes the highest

murder rate in the country, one of the highest infant
mortality rates on the planet (even higher than the Soviet
Union), a severe drug crisis, and many other problems.

One of Jaekson’s goals if he becomes" mayor is to push
for statehood for the District of Columbia. Surely, if he

' accomplishes this insignificant task, it could mean that the

capital might then be entitled to two senators and a
number of representatives —— Jackson could then leave
the office of mayor and cruise right into the U.S. Senate.

We don’t know whether Jackson would be good for_
2 D.C., or vice versa, but let’s hope that if he does choose
. to take (it’ll be that easy for him) the mayoral position that

he takes it for the benefit of the city, instead of for his own
personal aggrandizement. “

 Pz'tt’s new nationality room

The city of Pittsburgh is a model example of a melting
pot of diverse ethnic groups. The Nationality Rooms in the
Cathedral of Learning of this university are a fine tribute
to the people who personify this city. However, although
nearly every ethnic group has a classroom dedicated to its
culture, black Americans —— one of the largest ethnic
groups in the city — were not previously represented.

On Dec; 17 the black culture was honored by the
dedication of the 22nd Nationality Room. 0

Establishing this classroom was not an easy task. It took
much dedication and hard work by such people as Nancy
Lee. Since 1972, Miss Lee has voluntarily helped to collect
the $250,000 needed to make this achievement possible.

The African Heritage classroom contains examples of
African art and represents the 52 countries of Africa. It
embodies the courtyard of an 18th century Ashanti village
‘in Ghana, West Africa.

The classroom is located on the third floor of the
Cathedral of Learning.

Let’s say that I spray graffiti on
the side of my house. Certainly
I have a right to do this. After all,
I do have a right to free speech.

Now let’s say that I spray graf-
fiti on’ someone else’s house
without permission. But the
police come by and make me
stop. Would this be censorship?
Doesn’t this violate my First
Amendment right to free speech?
Absolutely not! This is not a
question of free speech. It is a
question of my vandalizing
someone else’s property. Simply
put, I can spray messages on my
own house, but not on someone
else’s.

Likewise, let’s say that I have
some paper and some ink. By
golly,.I can start a magazine. And
I can decide exactly what goes in
it, because it is my magazine.

Now let’s say that I mail a letter

O to the editor of -Time magazine.

The editor decides not to print it.
Isn't this censorship? Doesn’t this
violate my First Amendment right
to free speech? Absolutely not!
Again, I can decide what goes
into my magazine, but not into
someone else’s.

The point that I am trying to '

make is that I never look at
anything as just an issue of free
speech. I look upon the afore-
mentioned situations as issues of
“property rights.” Simply put, the
owner of any piece of property
has a right to use it however he or
she desires, just as long as it is not

used to harm or threaten to harm
someone else or their property.

Thus, I can cover my own house

in graffiti, but not someone else’s.
I can decide what goes into my

» magazine, but not someone

else’s. The only way that free

speech can properly be defined
is by the existence of property
rights. 0
Currently, some politicians are
trying to pass laws that would
require obscene records to be
labeled as such. Some say this is
censorship; some say it isn't.
However, based upon the above
theory of property rights, such
laws would clearly be wrong.
The government should not
decide whether or not a specific
record or tape should be labeled.
W/ho should decide such a thing?
The owner. If the owner of a

record store wishes to label, the
records in his store, he should be
able to do so. It should be his
decision, not the government’s.

What about flag burning? Per-
son/ally, I love the U.S. ﬂag. The
principles of freedom upon which
our nation was founded are ex-
tremely important to me. I would
never burn a ﬂag. However, if
somebody else wished to burn a
ﬂag that he or she owned, then
they should be allowed to. Re-
gardless of my feelings about
flag-burning, I have no right to
decide what someone else should
do with his or her property.

When Salman Rushdie wrote
The Satanic Verses, many Mus-
lims were calling for his execu-
tion. Most Americans, however,
defended Rushdie’s right to free
speech. But later, when the issue
of ﬂag burning came up, most
Americans seemed to have al-
tered their opinions concerning
freedom of speech. While most
U.S. citizens had believed in
Rushdie’s right to publish his
book, a majority wanted laws
against flag burning. This seems
very inconsistent.

But I choose to remain consis-
tent. I feel that property rights
and free speech should be in-
separable: if you own it, then you
can do what you want with it;
then again, if it’s not yours, leave
it alone.

Grad student Voices complaints

In reference to the article,
“Safety precautions in Pitt sci-
ence labs questioned,” which
was printed on the front page of
The Pitt News on Jan. 10, 1990, I
feel the need to clarify some
points.

First of all, the comments that
I made to Jim Tezak were made
under the assumption that any
article written would address the
general safety and student aware-
ness of all Pitt labs. Instead the
article wrongfully pitted myself
against my department and the
administration. A combination
of misquotes and information
taken out of context and embel-

lished with the reporter’s own
opinions has caused potential
hardship not only to myself but
to other co-workers who sup-
port the article’s underlying truths.

Comments in the article from
within my department ranged
from, “It is about time something
was said; people seem to forget
about safety,” to who cares,
“Everyone’s going to die eventu-
ally.”

The point is that I care, as do
many others, and students should
be aware of the potentially haz-
ardous substances and situations
that may be present in Pitt’s re-
search and teaching labs.

Academic organizations should
be responsible for the safety
education and enforcement of
today's science career majors. It
is this safety education that will
be carried into industry and
possibly have a tremendous
impact on the health of future
generations and our environment.
Hopefully, responsible journal-
ism will remedy the situation and
an article can be written concern-
ing general safety guidelines and
their impact on students and all
university employees.

Tracksters sprint past  
Ohio State, lose to PSU

By Ron Ledgard
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s track and field
team defeated Ohio State 57-55
and lost to Penn State 59-57 this
past weekend at Ohio State.

Pitt Coach John Vasvary said,
“The [Pitt] team was running
aggressively, and we were able
to accomplish some things to
help us the rest of the season.

“With a little luck We would
have been able to beat Penn
State." —

The team lostin the ﬁeld portion
of the meet to Penn State 22-5.

“We just don’t have the facilities
to practice the field events. We
still enter the events, but it’s very
difficult without the ability to
practice,” Vasvary said.

Pitt had five first—place finishers

including three members
qualifying for the IC4A
Championships at ‘ Harvard

University, March 3 and‘4.

It’s not as serious as the type
of revenge that Charles Bronson
sought in the Death Wish movies,
but tonight the Pitt basketball
team will be trying to avenge
Syracuse’s early January come-
from-behind win in the Pittsburgh
Civic Arena.

What made that last game
especially hard to take was the
way Pitt lost it. At the time,
Syracuse was the No. 1-ranked
team in the nation, and the
Panthers led throughout most of
the game. With just under three
minutes remaining, Pitt held a
comfortable 10-point lead. But
the Panthers failed to score again,
and the Orangemen shocked the
crowd and wonit 80-78 on a
Stephen Thompson break—away
slam with five seconds left.

So getting a little revenge will
be on the minds of the Panthers,
who are 1-4 in Big—East play.

“I think our players feel we
owe them one,” said Pitt’s 6-foot-
10 center Darren Morningstar.
“They beat us down here in a
game we felt we should have
won. We want to win the game
more than anything, and we’ll
definitely go up there and try as
hard as we can to bring back a
victory after they beat us here,”

,Having already faced them,
Pitt has an idea of what Syracuse’s
game plan will be.

“I expect them to try to pressure
us with their ful1=court press,
because they were successful

’ with it last game. I also expect

them to get the ball inside,” said
Darelle Porter, Pitt’s versatile
guard. “We need this game to

Ellis in the 55—meter hurdles,
Wayne Smith in the 600, Chris
Nauman in the 800 and the 4 x
400 relay team (Neil Malobicky,
Chop Burton, Brian Whitley and
Ellis). Rice, Ellis and the 4 x 400
team qualified for the IC4A.

Among the second—place
finishers, Rice in the 55 and Keith
Dowling in the 3,000 qualified for
the IC4A. ‘

“It was a good team effort
because of some injuries we had.

The freshmen and sophomores‘

were especially impressive. They
filled some holes we had and did
a great job,” said Vasvary.

Two weeks ago, the Panthers
dominated the University of
Windsor team challenge, The

Panthers scored '0 a 144 over.

Windsor with 71, Western Ontario
with 61 and York with 38.

They had 12 first—place finishers
including five meet records.

In winning the 60 and the 300
races, Rice was voted meet MVP
for the second year.

See Track, page 14

move up in the Big East. We
want to get some kind of winning

. streak going.”

Syracuse’s tough full-court
press forced Pitt into committing
15 turnovers in their last meeting.
The press also held Pitt to just 50
shots to Syracuse’s 86.

Derrick Coleman is the
Orangemen’s main man inside.
At 6-10, Coleman leads Syracuse
in scoring in the Big East with
19.8 ppg. and in rebounding
with 14.3. Billy Owens
complements Coleman inside,
adding 14.8 points and 8.5
rebounds a game. Point guard
Stephen Thompson scores over
18 points per game.

But Syracuse has fallen upon
hard times of late. After going
undefeated in their first 10 games,
the Orangemen are on a 2-3
streak, including losing their last
two games to Connecticut and
Providence. The Providence

game was a rare loss in the.

Carrier Dome, Syracuse’s huge
home court which averages over
30,000 fans for Big—East games.

“The Carrier Dome is probably
one of the best facilities in college
basketball for a school to play
in,” said Morningstar, who has
not played there yet. “A lot of
players on our team talk highly
of it and the different feeling you
get from it, and I’m looking
forward to finally getting to play
in it. Hopefully we can play Pitt
basketball in '.he Carrier Dome.”

Morningstar added that in this
case, Pitt basketball will force
Syracuse to take outside shots,
get the — ball to the Panthers’
shooters and get the ball inside.
“I think the game up there will be
another physical inside" match-
up,” said Morningstar.

The Lady Panther
gymnastics team’s spirit was
not broken when they took

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Tuesday, January 23, 1990

 

Warning: Sports addiction sweeping through USA

One of the most serious
problems threatening American
men going into t.he 1990's can be
categorized as an addiction. Not
narcotic or alcohol addiction.
Not cigarette addiction. Not sex
addiction, nor caffeine addition.

Be wary of... sports addiction.

Throughout American cities —
particularly those with
professional sports teams, such
as Pittsburgh —— sports addiction
is becoming a greater and greater
problem among men between
the ages of 13—50, and a greater

I. and greater threat for women of

the same age bracket who are
interested‘ in these men.

It seems the days of “Not
tonight, honey, I have a
headache,” are being replaced
in the touche fashion of “Not
tonight, honey; it’s Dick Vitale
and a triple—header night on
ESPN."

With the massive expansion
of sports coverage by the media
in the 1980’s, sports addicts are

becoming more and more
commonplace than ever before.

“If I don’t get to read the sports
page on any given day, it seems
like something is missing,” says
Jim, a 22-year old Pitt senior.
“You know, like the average
person eats breakfast, lunch and
dinner, I have to have the sports
page of the Press, Post-Gazette,
and USA Today, or I’ll be in a
rotten mood all day.

“Once I went to the beach for
two weeks, and had my sister
back home save all the local
papers. When I came back, I
read all the sports pages of the
past 14 days in one day. It was
almost, well, ecstasy.” ,

“Sports can be better than sex;
it sounds strange to say, but it’s
true,” says Tim, 21, another Pitt
senior. “I get more of a thrill
when my roommate walks into
the room with the day’s Press
sports page than I would if he
walked in with the latest Playboy.
I become aroused, but in a

E-'--‘STUDENT

GVERNMET

Stuent Government Board

different way.”

That’s scary. Kind of sick in a
way, too.

Says Jim, “I particularly love
watching basketball on TV. I’ll
watch the NBA, the World
Basketball League, the CBA,
college games on BET, as long as
its basketball. I'm lucky Pitt doesn’t

carry cable television in the dorms,
because ESPN would help me
flunk right out of school.”

Paul, 23, is a school teacher
living in Atlantic City, NJ. His
favorites of the sporting world
are Louisv_ille’s college basketball
team and the Pittsburgh Steelers
of the NFL. What makes Paul so

 

unique is his astronomical phone
bill — the product of hundreds of
long-distance telephone calls for
hours upon end to friends
concerning the play of Louisville,
the Steelers and sports in general.
And his explanation is even more
frightening than the size of his
bill each month.-

‘‘I love the ‘Ville.”

He loves the ‘Ville. That’s all

~ there is to it. So simple, yet so

deeply—rooted. Yet it’s responses
like these that have psychologists
all over the world tied in knots
trying to solve the secrets of this
disease and unravel the
complexity of its origins.
“Sports can be overaddictive;
it can be used as an
overcompensation a lot of times,
to be a crutch for some sort of
inner character flaw or
deficiency,” says psychology
expert Joe Turturica of the
University of Pittsburgh and the
North Oakland Sports Junkie
Rehabilitation Center.

“The real danger comes when
these addicts become so absorbed
in the sports world that they
begin to identify with a particular
sports person or team. When
these sports groups do well, the
addict is lifted to an emotional
high. Likewise, when these

groups fail, theaddict drops into

an emotional abyss. They literally
take wins, losses, trades and
retirements in the sporting world
personally. It can be devastating.
I’ve seen the results — excessive
hair-pulling, depression, loss of
weight, fatigue, broken television
sets, upset bowls of Pringles. You
wouldn't believe the amount of
cigarette burns I see strictly from
guys cheering aloud and
forgetting they have a smoke in
their mouth.” I

Turturica has supplied a list of
symptoms to help identify a
possible sports addict:

-Gets out of bed in the middle
of the night to buy the ﬁnal
edition of the Post—Gazettesports
page.

-Comes home drunk from a
bar and jumps into bed with a

THE PI'IT NEWS, Tuesday, January 23, 1990

Miller forced to look

on as team struggles

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

All Sean Miller can do for the
rest of the year is watch.

He can’t bring the ball up the
court. He can't move closer to
Pitt’s career assist record. And he
can’t contribute any more three-
pointers to the Panther offense.

When Miller first injured his
foot before the season started it
was thought to be a stress fracture
and many believed he would be
ready to play for Pitt’s opener.
But weeks passed and the foot
didn’t heal. It was determined
that it wasn’t a stress fracture and
it would take longer to heal than
initially thought.

“It’s like a genetic thing, I have
two bones rubbing against each
other, and they shouldn’t be
doing that,” said Miller. “The
only way to correct that is through
surgery. It’s coming along good.
I have two more weeks on
crutches and then I start my
rehab.”

Miller said his rehabilitation
will consist of swimming, running
in a pool, running in straight
lines, and other light manual
exercises.

Not being able to practice or
play with the team makes Miller

feel like he doesn't have an
identity with the 1989~l990 Pitt
basketball team, that is now 1-4
in the Big East.

“I really don’t feel like I am that
much a part of things because
I’m not practicing," said Miller.
“I'm still a good part of what’s
happening as far as the guys, I
mean I have some real good
friends on the team. But I would
be lying if I said I felt like I was
part of the team. I wish I was out
there, I think I could deﬁnitely
help the cause.” v

An exclamation for Pitt’s 1-4
start is that without Miller the
other players had to move to
positions they are not used to.

“It seems like everyone’s just

Bulls drop under .500 With loss

By Geoff Moskowitz
Staff Writer

The Pittsburgh Bulls are
finding out just how hard it is
to be an expansion team in
any league. In front of a crowd
of 12,327 atjoe Louis Arena in
Detroit, the Bulls (1-2) lost
their second consecutive game
of the season to the Detroit
Turbos by a score of 12-11.

The Bulls were led once
again by rookie Brian Nikula.
Nikula, who joined the Bulls
from Whittier College in

California, contributed four
goals and an assist.

The Bulls have a brother
combination of Mark and Jay
Gold both who had standout
games against the Turbos. Jay
had two goals and three assists,
and Mark contributed three
goals and four assists. Both
brothers played at the University
of Maryland at Baltimore County
and are residents of the
Baltimore area. Like many of
the Bulls, Mark and Jay played
their last three seasons with the
disbanded Washington Wave.

Other contributors for the
Bulls included Pat Hanley and
Brenden Kelly. Hanley, a
former member of the Wave,
had one goal and one assist.
Kelly, a rookie, was a member
of the national-championjohns
Hopkins squad last year. Kelly,
who earned All-American
honors in 1988 and 1989, had
one goal and one assist against
the Turbos.

The Bulls will attempt to even
their record at the Civic Arena
on Feb. 3 at 8 p.m. against the
Baltimore Thunder.

Big East in assists and scoring
over 10 points. Last season Miller
