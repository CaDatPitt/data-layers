  Mitters After 1 st Win
Saturday With Kent

By JACK SNIITH
After the basebal1»team’s three losses to Ohio State last

~.F

<5‘

 
    
 

weekend, Panther followers

are questioning the power

hitting Coach Bobby Lewis claimed to have. The mitters

‘will get a chance to bounce

back, however, as they play

their ﬁrst away game this Saturday at Kent State.
Although the Panthers stopped Kent State. last year,

State is rated as a strong team; '

Earlier’ this seas-on they split a
doubleheader with_Ohio State, the
team the Panthers lost to 5-3, 1-0,
and 3-2.

State ‘ has an All-American
candidate in the second baseman
Dick Rollins. Lewis rates Rol-
lins tremendous and other are
comparing him to the Pirates
Bill Mazerowski. “This boy
does eVel‘ytl_1_ing,” Lewis says.

The Panthers main problem is
in the hitting department. The
hitting was off against Ohio State
and the only player who consist-

 _ently got on base was Corky

Cuthbert, a boy in his ﬁrst year
of college ball. Lewis has been
playing him at short. _“He has
good moves on the ﬁeld and at
-bat.” Lewis said,’ “He should. be-
come a top player.”

Mike Ditka is alternating in
right ﬁeld with Zeke Zanico-
poulos. Pete Suder has been

« moved into left along with Jim

Donahue another addition. _

Before playing the Panthers,
Ohio State had played 11 games.
Both the batters and pitchers
were ahead of the unpracticed
Cats. _

“Our pitching looked goodand

our hitting will come, around,’’—

Lewis commented, “,it’s just a

matter of time. We will get plenty.

of batting practice thisweek and

‘may _make lineup . changes.

Panthers Look
To Geneva for

Racket Match

Coach Bill Summers’ tennis
squad was squashed by an unde-
_feated Toledo team by a -score of

8-1 at Wildwood last Saturday.,

The match scheduled with Geneva

last Monday has been postponed
to this Friday. ,

‘A wel1—balanced g r o u p of
T o 1 e do sophomores played _ a
“forcing game,” making the Pan-
thers commit errors. The Cats put
up a‘good ﬁght as they took most
of the sets into extra games.

Bill Hinkle, playing number
one, defeated his opponent 6-3,
6-2. -

Ted Martens, number four, en-
gaged in aimarathon, which ended
in a l4-12, 7-5 loss. _ V

The doubles matches were also

. close, as the number one team of

Martens and Kochman were edged
6-4, ‘2-6, 6-4.

Coming "up on the schedule are
the rained out Geneva match and
Penn State, winless, so far .this

year.

Miami Victory

Goal for Truck

There are only two weeks
left before the Penn Relays
in Philadelphia, but the
Panther trackrnen are only
looking to this weekend for
they have a dual meet with
Miamr of Ohio at home on Friday
and the Ohio Relays in Columbus
on Saturday; « '

With the loss of Jim Donahue,
their second’ fastest man, to the

baseball team, the Panthers will’

once again lack point getters in
the sprints as well as losing a
valuable man in relays.

The meet with Miami, which is O

scheduled to begin at 1:30‘ p.m.
should give the trackmen their
ﬁrst win. Although Miami is one
of the top teams in the Mid-Amer-
ican Conference, the Panthers
have managed to squeeze by them
in past encounters.

How well the Panthers will be
able "to do in the Ohio Relays is
still a question. Since the Cats
will run in a dual meet on Friday,

they can’t be expected to be too‘

strong. The dual meet along with
the loss of Donahue will hurt the
Panthers on Saturday. ‘

Golf Plans to Win ‘
With Sub-Par. Play '

The golf team will meet In-
diana State Teachers College, at
Wildwood today and travel to
Juniata on Saturday. ,

The team will consist of cap-
tain Tom Treese, Don Dermit, Bill
Hoffman, Gary Stuart, Bob Mc-
Kenzie,‘ Dale Long and Larry
Haggerty. '.

Last Saturday the Cats lost to
Penn, State 5-2. Dermit led both

"NO PARKING”.

As everyone knows, the most serious problem facing American ‘

colleges today is the shortage of parking space for students’ cars.

Many remedies have been offered to solve this vexing dilemma.
For instance, it has been suggested that all students be required
to drive small foreign sports cars which can be carried in the

purse or pocket. This would, of course, solve the parking prob- .

lem but it wouldlmake double dating impossib1e—unless, that
is, the boys make the girls run along behind the car. But that
is no solution either because by the time they get to the prom
the girls will be panting so hard that they will wilt their corsages.

Another suggested cure for our parking woes is that all
students smoke Marlboro cigarettes. At ﬁrst glance this seems
an excellent solution because we all know Marlboro is the
cigarette which proved that ﬂavor did not go out when ﬁlters
came in—and when we sit around and smoke good Marlboros
we are so possessed by sweet contentment that none of us
wishes ever to leave, which means no gadding about which
means no driving, which means no parking problem.

But the argument in favor of Marlboros overlooks one im-
portant fact: when you run out of Marlboros you must go get
some more, which means driving, which means parking, which
means you’re right back where you started.

Probably the most practical suggestion to alleviate the cam pus
parking situation is to tear down every school of dentistry in
the —cou_ntry and turn it into a parking lot. his is not to say

that dentistry is unimportant. Gracious, no! Dentistry is im-
portant and vital and a shining part of our American heritage.
'‘ But the fact is there is no real need for separate schools of den-
tistry. Dentistry could easily be moved to the school of mining
‘ engineering. Surely anyone who can drilla thousand feet for g . i

oil can ﬁll a simple little cavity. ‘

This experiment—combining dentistry with mining engineer-

ing—has already been tried at several colleges-—a.nd with some ~

very interestingresults. Take, for instance, the case of 9. dental
student named Fred C. Sigafoos. One day recently Fred was

, out practicing with his drilling rig in a vacant lot just off

\

campus. He sank a shaft two hundred feet deep and,.to his
surprise and delight, he struck a detergent mine. For a while
Fred thought his fortune was made but he soon learned that
he had drilled into the storage tank of the Eagle Laundry.
Walter ‘P. Eagle, president of the laundry, was mad as all get-
out and things looked mighty black for Fred. But it all ended
well. When Mr. Eagle called Fred into his oﬁice to chew him

-out, it so happened that Mr. Eagle’s beautiful daughter, Patient

Griselda, was present. For years Patient Griselda had 
patiently waiting for the right man. “That’s him!” she 
upon spying Fred—and today Fred is a full partner in the Eagle
Laundry in charge of pleats and ruﬂles. °“’°° M“ "““'*l“"

Speaking of laundries reminds us of cleanliness which in

The students checking cards
found that their work went more
smoothly than usual. Ellen Bog-
dan, LA ’62, one of the checkers,
said, “Everyone had his cards in
order, and things went much fast-
er than ever before.” V

There were a few cynics in the
crowd. Jim Emert, LA ’61, saw
the same old confusion on a
smaller scale. “There was more
confusion than people.”

Emily Kaiserman, LA ’62, stat-
ed, “I’ve,never had suchva bad
schedule./I thought we’d. get our
choice of class times the _ third
trimester.” This opinion was re-
peated by several people who
were disappointed with their
spring schedules.
