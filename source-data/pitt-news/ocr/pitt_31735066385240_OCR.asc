Of D. H. Bertenthal & Sons.

Noschese testified that Musko
was arrested as he left a dinner
meeting with Bertenthal, who
wore a concealed tape recorder.

the FBI had given Bertenthal, ac-
cording to Noschese. ’

Pitt named host of regional conference

By John Enright

The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh
has been namedthe host school
of the Association of College
Unions-International (ACU-I)
Region IV Conference which will
be held Oct. 27-29 at the William
Pitt Union next year.

Joe Cavalla, Pitt's director of
student activities, said the empha-
sis of the conference will be
educational programming for stu-
dents and professional staff in-
volved in student activities.

’’we’ll do a lot of programs that
gear themselves to the union and
student activities,” Cavalla said.
”The conference_is primarily for

— students. Probably tvvo—thirds will

be here versus [one]-third profes-

sional staff. We hope to get 275
people.” .

ACU—I has 16 regions across
the country. The region Pitt is in
consists of approximately 90
schools in West
Maryland, Washington, D.C..and
all areas of Pennsylvania west of
Philadelphia.

The Region IV Conference has
never been held at Pitt. Du-
quesne, however, hosted the
conference in 1980.

CavaIIa’s own involvement
with ACU-I spearheaded the ef-
fort to bring the conference to
Pitt. Cavalla is in the second year
of a three-year term as vice presi-
dent for regional affairs for ACU-I.

This is CavaIIa’s second year at
Pitt. He hosted a similar confer-
ence for Region III when he was

Virginia, I

director of student activities at
Rider College in New Jersey.

”I got to thinking when I came‘.

to Pittsburgh that this regional
conference has not been out in
this neck of the woods for eight
years,” he said. ’’In Region IV,
western Pennsylvania has not
been the hot bed. It's mostly been
the eastern part of the region and
Maryland.”

”We decided it would be nice
to try to bring it back to western
Pennsylvania, and since I have in—
volvement on the national level,
it would be nice to have it at the
University of Pittsburgh,” he
added.

Cavalla said no official confer-
ence agenda has been set. He did
say that program topics would in-

Philadelphia mayor opposed to white pride rally

PHILADELPHIA (AP) ~ Mayor
W. Wilson Goode wants the Na-
tional Park Service to reconsider
its decision to allow a ”white
pride” rally near Independence
Hall Nov. 5 and if the rally oc-
curs, he wants counter-
demonstrators to stay away.

The United‘ States League of
White Christian Patriots, a coali-
tion of white-supremist groups
that includes the Ku Klux Klan,
will probably get its permit to
hold the rally sometime this
week. Two anti—Klan groups have
already received rally permits for
the area, according to park ser-
vice officials.

Park Superintendent Hobart
Cawood said he could ”not see
any alternative but to approve” a
permit for the White Patriots
group.

Courtdecisions have said the
government cannot refuse a per-
mit merely because officials be-
lieve that violence is possible,
Cawood said. He said the permit

" would likely be approved by

Wednesday or Thursday.
Goode, at a City Hall press
conference Mondav, said he be-

lieved it would be ”a clear and

John Weiss, Klan spokesman in
Philadelphia, said the KKK was
joining with the Skinheads, the
White Aryan Resistance Move-
ment and at least 15 other simi-
lar groups for a white pride rally.
He has requested permits for
Nov. 5 in the name of the White
Christian Patriots group.

Launch of the space
telescope now 1989

WASHINGTON (AP) ~ The
space shuttle launch of the Hub-
ble Space Telescope will be
moved up from February 1990,
to December 1989, the National
Aeronautics and Space Adminis-
tration announced today.

A NASA release said the
change was made possible after
a ”reassessment” of the space
shuttle launch schedule and
payloads.

Experts believe the telescope

NEWS BRIEFS

will be able to study stars and
galaxies more than 14 billion
light years from Earth and to cap-
ture images of the universe that
are much clearer than those seen
by ground—based telescopes.

NASA originally planned to
launch the Hubble in 1985, but
the date slipped to the fall of
1986 and was then delayed be-
cause of the January 1986
Challenger accident.

A space shuttle will carry the
telescope into an orbit about 360
miles above the earth.

The telescope is designed to
transmit its observations to Earth
for about three years. A shuttle
would then visit the observatory
to replace batteries and to make
repairs if needed. The telescope
would also be boosted into a
higher orbit as needed to keep it
from falling to Earth.

ly 10 years after the accident at
Three Mile Island, a panel of
citizens and scientists said Tues-
day that the contaminated
nuclear reactor should not be
mothballed next year as planned
because the cleanup is not
finished.

But a spokesman for the Penn-
sylvania p|ant’s operator said TMI
managers hoped to go ahead
with the plan to place the crip-
pled Unit 2 reactor into ”moni-
tored storage” by the end of next
yean

Under the plan, the reactor
building would be locked up, un-
needed systems deactivated and
the plant would sit for perhaps 30
years while radiation decays in-
side. Although the damaged
nuclear fuel and loose radioactive
components would have been re-
moved from the plant, radiation
would remain in piping and other
areas _of the reactor building
basement. _

Arthur E. Morris, the panel's
chairman who is the mayor of
Lancaster, Pa., said many in the
group felt thegplan was too vague.

_Amyloidosis\ research fund set up in name of Caliguiri

By Suzanne Sabol
Staff Writer

In memory of the late mayor,
Richard Caliguiri, Pittsburghers
are contributing money to a fund
that will support research of
amyloidosis, the disease that
Qaused his death.
The Richard S. Caliguiri fund
was started by Mrs. Caliguiri
when she asked for donations to

'.v‘..

the fund in lieu of flowers at her
husband's funeral.

Since then, the fund has grown.
The total money raised is over
$100,000, according to Hetty
McCiinnis, the development
officer for the Pittsburgh Foun-
dation.

Although the Pittsburgh Foun-
dation manages the Caliguiri
fund, the money comes from or-

ganizations in the city that have

raisers in the late mayor's honor.

”We’ve had over 1,900 gifts to
the fund  from a few coins to
thousands of dollars," McGinnis
said.

She added that this weekend,
money was raised from a run and
walk in Schenley Park. Recently.
the Art Institute of Pittsburgh had
a fashion show, in which the pro-
ceeds went to the Caliguiri fund,

”Groups all over the city are
plugging into this.” McGinnis

commented.

Local businesses are helping its
well. Giant Eagle is selling au(;io
cassettes, which contain special
music written for the occasion,
and video cassettes, which
remember the years that Caliguiri
was mayor of Pittsburgh. All
money received from sale of the
cassettes will go to the fund.

The Richard S. Caliguiri fund is
also attracting attention from out-
side of Pittsburgh. McGinnis ex-.
plained, ”There was a woman in

Calitor iia who died from amyloi-

and gifts to the fund.”

All of the money raised will be
given to a research center for
amyloidosis in the Pittsburgh
area. The center hasn't been
chosen yet, but it should be an-
nounr ed later this month.

Amyloidosis is a disease that
causes protein deposits to build
in the vital organs, leading to or-
gan failure. As of now, there is no
cure

However, as contributions con-
tinue to come into the Caliguiri
fund, researchers may soon be
ableto better understand the dis-
ease and eventually find a cure.

Those who are working to
build up the fund, like McGinnis,
feel that ”this is a fitting tribute,”
to a man like Richard Caliguiri.

Kickback

Musko put up his house as a
surety to be released on a
$10,000 bond.

Musko was suspended from his
job without pay pending resolu-
tion of the case, according to The
Pittsburgh Post—Cazette.

Noschese said Bertenthal told
him that Musko began demand-
ing money in return for orders
when the company's business
started to increase in 1982.

Bertenthal said that he and

a kickback after Pitt paid the bill.

Bertenthal said that prior to
Musko’s demands, Bertenthal &
Sons had been doing business
with Pitt for 19 years.

According to Noschese, Ber-

The I00th Congress adjourned last Saturday, finishing
a surprisingly strong final year in session when they passed
major legislation such as welfare reform, arms control and
trade policy. I‘

A lot of the fighting that usually occurs between
Democrats and Republicans was subdued as both parties
tried to get some major bills through before adjournment.
The two most impressive were the welfare reform bill and
the Omnibus drug bill. The welfare reform was a good
example of how both parties compromised to get a much

. needed bill passed. - -

The last two years, with Iran-contra and the Wall Street
crash, gave this Congress a lot of incentive and ability to
move this kind of legislation, and they took advantage of
the opportunity to work with the executive branch and
their compatriots.

Now that the 100th Congress has convened, all con-
gressman can be proud of their work down to the wire.

Of course, a lot of the incentive came from the fact that
it is an election year, since both Democrats and Republi-
cans want to look good for their individual campaigns.
It is unfortunate that Congress doesn't work this well all

the time.

In a nutshell...

”|f Dukakis goes to bed at night and doesn't hate me
a little more, I'm not doing my job.”

litical director for Bush's campaign.

And was I shocked to read how
upset both the newspaper and the
Pitt community are about having
only one candidate running for
SGB president.

In last April's election of Point
Park's United Student Govern-
ment, only one president/vice
president team ran.

Anna Kloska and Lisa Dick
were the only two who took the
time and cared enough to apply
to run and obviously, are the best
for the job.  Anna, Lisa and their
board have turned our former
semi-apathetic school around.
Functions are we||—attended, and
USC posts are now filled with a
cross-section of the -col lege com-
munity.

So, don't rule out write-in cam-
paigns, and don't despair about
having only one candidate. He
very well may turn out to be the
president you need, and your
worrying may have been useless.
At least wait until after the elec-
tion, and see what happens then,
to worry.

At Your Service?

It was Saturday afternoon, Oct.
8, when my II-month-old son
and I were walking around Oak-
land. It was very cold and the hu-

midity was very high. By 5:40 __

p.m., a strong rain came sudden-
ly, and of course we did not have
an umbrella. So we waited on the
sidewalk next to a store's door
while I covered my dear first-born
with my coat. It was on Atwood
Street and the rain did not stop
before 6:50 p.m. At that time, my
son was placidly sleeping in his
stroller, and I was very concerned
about the rain. I

Finally, a police car came with
the well-known logo “At Your
Service,” and my happiness was

completed. But, when I asked the

officer to call a taxi for me, she
answered, ”Sorry, I can not do
that.” After that kind of answer,
I really did not know what to do.

I remember the news about a
police officer off duty who saved
a man in the Allegheny River two
months ago. After that, I thought
all the officers in Pittsburgh liked
their fellow citizens and were
concerned about them - but I was
wrong.

It was a bad experience that
Saturday afternoon. I believe that

‘some police officers must change

their job or change the logo on
the side of their cars.

Blurred Images of Abroad.

Congratulations. You have just
printed one of the most pathetic
articles I have ever read. This

\ masterpiece from your ”|mages

Abroad” section was written by

Michele Quinn and entitled,

”Voyager student participates in
English pub chicanery.” It must
have been assumed that the aver-
age Pitt News reader would not
know the meaning of the word
”chicanery” and therefore be-
lieve the article was about some
form of charity work. This as-
sumption is false.

It is the story of how an Ameri-
can student went to England and
got drunk. Nothing else. Is this
really such a newsworthy event?
I guess so. After all, why publish
an article about a student going
overseas to discover a fascinating
and different culture, when in-
stead you can publish an article

about getting sloshed?

Some of the critical questions missed at the debates

I am sad that there will be no
more presidential debates. The
reason for this is that there are so
many questions left unanswered.
The panel members for the three
debates did what they could to

draw the candidates out, but I be-
lieve that they should have been
tougher. Here are the questions
I wish they had posed to the con-
tenders:

”Sir, if you were a gypsy moth,
what kind of gypsy moth would

, you be?”

”Name the last three Dead Sea
Scrolls you have read in the origi-
nal and why you would recom-
mend them to every American

child.’’
’’If you wife were knocked

down on a dark street, brutally

kicked and her purse snatched
away from her, would you still
pardon Ollie North?”

”Do you believe a man on wel-
fare, who refuses to look for a
job, is entitled to a ZIP code?”

’ ”Would you recommend three
good restaurants in the Boston
area to a convict who is going on
a weekend furlough?”

”If you were a guacamole dip,
what kind of guacamole dip
would you be?’’ ,

”Do you believe that card-
carrying members of the ACLU
should lose their driving
privileges on federally funded in-
terstate highways?”

”|f someon-e took all the gar-
bage in Boston Harbor and
dumped it off the beaches of
New Jersey, would the people of
New Jersey consider that a cheap
shot?”

’’Please give me four dates on
which the Japanese might have

bombed Pearl Harbor.”

”|f Sen. Bentsen gets elected,
will those lobbyists who could
not affor $10,000 for breakfast in
his office be entitled to meet with
him for $5,000 in the Senate
cafeteria?”

”If you were a Scotch-tape dis-
penser, what kind of Scotch-tape
dispenser would you be?”

”Would you advocate the
death penalty for any pregnant
woman who does not believe in
the right-to—life movement?”

”Governor, when you play
baseball with a kid for the TV
cameras, do you ever put pine tar
on your glove?”

”Mr. Vice President, do you
think Mike Tyson and Robin
Givens represent the family
values that you hold so dear?”

”Sen. Bentsen, if Dan Quayle
is no Jack Kennedy, does that
make Mrs. Quayle no Jackie
Onassis?”

”Sen. Quayle, if we refues to
embargo American wheat and
sell it to the Russians, won't they
become healthy and want to kill
us?”

”Governor, the polls indicate
that the only way you can win the
election now is to tell us how you
made Massachusetts one of the
great states in the Union. Are you
prepared to break your vow of
secrecy and tell us how you did
it?”

”Sen. Quayle, would you
agree to enroll in the Electoral
College if you father made a large
donation to the school?"

”Please tell us the names of all
your heroes, and whether any of
them has done TV commercials

for Wheaties?”

”Do you think a gun is the best
answer to poor grades in

”If you were President of the

England's lack of Halloween forces traveler to find substitute

When my friends and I tried to
buy a pumpkin for Halloween in
Durham last year, we surprised
the vegetable vendors by saying
we wanted to carve it into a jack-
o’-lantern.

”But usually people buy pump
kins to make soup!” exclaimed
an old lady with a thick northern
English accent.

x‘\./

”We don't have many pump-
kins. Do you want to carve a
squash?” asked another woman
as she pointed her gloved finger
at a pile of green and yellow
squash in the corner.

I politely refused the squash,
chose two medium size pump-
kins and almost dropped them
when she said the cost was

university more difficult to plan.

Where were we going to find
the popcorn, candy apples and
apple cider? Not to mention the
orange and black balloons and
streamers.

We started searching at the lo-
cal grocery store. We guessed
that, despite being Halloween
cuisine, most of the food we
needed would be found on the
store's shelves.

I scanned the aisles for cider
among the bottles of beverages
while Linda and Laura — two
other American girls in charge of
the party’s decorations — looked
in the produce section.

We finally met at the checkout
counter and asked an employee
where we could find apple cider.

”In a pub, of course!” he said,
laughing andshaking his head.

We tried to explain that we did
not want the English version of
”cider” — which is an alcoholic
beverage that tastes like turned
cider. He shrugged his shoulders,
said he didn’t understand and
quickly returned to pricing cans.

Giving up on the cider, we

i went to the local movie theater

in search of popcorn. We dis-
covered that although they sold
popcorn, they did not butter it. In-
stead, they coated it in sickly
sweet sugar. '

We quietly left the movie the-
ater, carrying the pumpkins close
to us — our only link with Hal-
loween.

As we walked toward the
health food store, younger chil-
dren stared curiously at our
pumpkins. I wanted to stop in the
middle of the old stone bridge,
put the pumpkin down, and try
to explain to all of those kids how
much fun it was to carve a pump-
kin and then roast the pumpkin
seeds.

Instead, I clutched the pumpkin
and ignored the little children —
realizing they probably wouldn't
understand.

Finally, we found popcorn.
With a slight smile, the man be-
hind the counter at the health
food store said that he had heard
of the strange American custom
of eating popcorn with butter.
We paid him for the popcorn and
walked out of the store.

We carefully carried our pur-
chases back to the college
cafeteria, deciding on our way to
forget about the streamers and

black and orange balloons. |n- .

stead, we would improvise by
coloring toilet paper with black
and orange markers and buying
multicolored balloons.

In the cafeteria, we popped
popcorn and carved pumpkins
while the cafeteria workers
laughed at us. They kept peering
over our shoulders as we tried to
scoop the insides of the pump-
kins out. A few of them said we
should make pumpkin soup in-
stead of wasting our time carving
something that would just rot.
Another cafeteria worker brought
over a bag of sugar for the pop-

corn and didn't understand when

we politely refused.

Many of them laughed when
we asked them to take our picture
as we proudly held the carved
pumpkins and large bowls of
popcorn. Though exhausted from
our attempts at trying to celebrate
Halloween in England, we smiled
cheerfully as the woman snapped
our picture.

Olympic diver Louganis
wasn’t always on top

_ By Matt Martin

Sports Editor

His teachers called him lazy.
They said he didn't apply himself.

His classmates called him
stupid; ”retarded.”

But after returning from Seoul
two weeks ago, Greg Louganis
has proved all his critics wrong,
winning two gold medals in the
XXIV Olympiad to add to his col-
lection of two other golds from
the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics
and a silver from the ’76 Games.

’’It’s taken me this long to real-
ize that I’ve deserved everything
I got,” the.28-year—old Olympic
champion told a sold—out au-
dience last night in the Assembly
Room of the William Pitt Union.

Louganis, who suffers from dys-
lexia, was not the most popular
boy in school until he returned
from the 1976 Montreal Olym-
pics as a 16-year-old silver
medalist.

”l was quiet and shy when I
was younger,” Louganis said,
although last night's casual dress
— a white polo shirt and khaki
trousers —— and easygoing manner
would lead you to believe
otherwise.

Dyslexia, which caused Louga-
nis to jumble words as he read
them — ’’I honestly believed I
was retarded,” Louganis said —
could be considered the catalyst
for Louganis’ success. -

”The success I did have wa
physical — I would get up on
stage and ‘perform and people
would applaud, so“| did have
something positive in my life to
keep me going.”

Sheils becomes top player for Lady Panthers

By Don Bo.yd
Staff Writer

Julie Sheils has emerged as a
standout player for the Pitt volley-
ball team. Combining powerful
spiking with a top-spin serve that
has frustrated opponents, she has
become a potent offensive force.

Sidelined by a severely
sprained ankle which occurred in
training camp, Sheils worked
hard at rehabilitating it and came
back three weeks later with a

How good can the Pitt basket-
ball team be this year?

Look no further than the front-
court. Last year, when Pitt had
Charles Smith, Jerome Lane and
Demetreus Gore, the question
was, ”Who will get the big men
the ball?” Freshmen guards Sean
Miller, Jason Matthews and
Darelle Porter answered that
question soon enough.

This year the Panthers are near-
ly equally adept at the scoring po-
sitions — ”We’re a little better at
outside shooting, and the re-
bounds will come,” Coach Paul
Evans said —— but the defense may
be suspect. The question may
very well be, "How can Pitt keep
opposing team's big men from

One dive in particular captured
the hearts of audiences around

the world — Louganis’ turn in the

three-meter springboard in Seoul.

”All I remember is hearing
something, and it was my head,”
Louganis said referring to the fate
ful dive in which he cracked his
head on the board.

”I knew I probably cut myself,
so I climbed out of the pool and
talked to my coach. He stood be-
side me as they put stitches in my
head.

”I talked to my coach, and he
said, ’We’ve worked a long time
for this,’ and we decided I'm go-
ing to try my best.”

Of course, Louganis went on to
capture the gold in the event, but
not without effort.

”lt,was more difficult to come
back the next day. That night I
didn't sleep. I had nightmares.
This would really be ridiculous if
I did this again.”

He didn't. Without missing a
dive, the second and final three-
meter gold of his career was
secure.

Louganis had recovered from
his injury just in time to face an
even greater challenge in the
10—meter platform competition -—
a 14-year-old Chinese team mem-
ber by the name of Xiong Ni.

”The Chinese kid,” as Louga-
nis called him, pushed Louganis’
gold medal hopes to the final
dive, where Louganis executed
what will be remembered as his
most famous effort — a 3‘/2 som-

ersault and tuck — to put the.

most famous diver in the world
in the record books forever.

But fame and a probable for-
tune have not gone to Louganis’
head. As he has done in diving
for the past 14 years, Louganis
has goals.

vengeance.

”The sprained ankle was
almost the worst time of my en-
tire life. I hated watching my
teammates and being unable to
help out,” said Sheils.

Sheils has saved some of her
best performances for the Lady
Panthers’ matches against tough
opposition.

When Pitt hosted West Virginia
on Oct. 1, Sheils led the way with
seven kills including a backrow
spike which stunned the Lady

Of course, Paul Evans’ suspect-
ed starting tandem of 6-foot-9
sophomore center Bobby Martin
and 6-6 sophomore small for-
ward Rod Brookin have proven
that they can play in the Big East.
Brookin was an offensive terror
his freshman year, averaging 10.2
points per game off the bench.

Before being declared academ-
ically ineligible last winter,
Brookin averaged 12.6 points in
five games.

Martin, also a reserve, averaged
nearly seven points and four re-
bounds per game in the Big East
last season, and also played 17
minutes per contest. '

Additionally, her serve proved
effective as she registered three
aces in the Lady Panthers’ three
game sweep.

On Oct. 14, Pitt upset the 15th-
ranked Lady Wildcats from the
University of Arizona in a five
game thriller (7-15, 15-13, 16-14,
14-16 and 16-14). Sheils accumu-
lated 21 kills in the match, sec-
ond on the team to All-American
candidate Denise Frawley’s 30.

Lady Panthers did not occur over-
night. She was recruited out of
Southern Cayuga High School in
New York state three years ago
by Pitt Coach Shelton Collier but
she wasn’t interested in a four-
year school and opted for Onon-
daga Junior College (near
Syracuse).

While at Onondaga, Sheils im-
proved her hitting ability and de-
veloped her top-spin serve. She
improved her game to the point

After sitting out last season due
to Propostion 48, Shorter is ready
to make an impact on the Big
East, and Evans thinks he is ready.

”I think he's real hungry,”
Evans said.

But even with the considerable
talent Evans has at his disposal,

dominated by big men?

would have it, her final two
choices were Pitt and Penn State.

I liked the team and the coach

And without Smith, who is the
career record-holder in blocked
shots at Pitt with 346, including
at least one blocked shot in 51
consecutive games and 1 1 1 of his
last’1 13 contests, that could be a
problem.

Smith blocked 96 shots last sea-
son, not closely followed by Mar-
tin's 18.

Of course, Martin came off the
bench. He has a quick step and
can get off the ground, and the

an inherent shot-blocking ability
that can make up for the height
he gives up.

Paterno stands by freshman QB after loss,

By David S. Martin

Associated Press Writer

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — Penn
State Coach Joe Paterno said
Tuesday he didn't think freshman
quarterback Tony Sacca lost con-
fidence in the Nittany Lions’ 8-3
loss to Alabama last Saturday.

’’I think Sacca came out of that
game understanding what hap-
pens in a big-pressure game. I
think this team understands,”
Paterno said at his weekly news
conference. .

’’I thought it was a learning
process. It was something he

as a result,” Paterno added.
Sacca, starting his fourth game,

completed eight of 28 passes

against Alabama for 98 yards.

In the second half, Sacca com-
pleted only one of 12 passes and
was sacked five times, once for a
safety. His only completion of the
half was a 16-yarder to Michael
Timpson on the Nittany Lions’
last possession.

Paterno said the Alabama game
provided Sacca with a good
primer on the blitzes and crowd
noise to expect in Morgantown,

ranked Mountaineers, 7-0.

’’I feel better about this team
than I have at any time this year,”
said Paterno in his twenty-third
year as Penn State's head coach.

Although Paterno said Sacca
played well, the coach didn't rule
out the possibility of senior Lance
Lonergan or redshirt freshman
Doug Sieg starting at quarterback
if they outplayed Sacca in prac-
tice this week.

’’I think we have to constantly
evaluate the situation,” Paterno
said.

Lonergan was sidelined for
several weeks with a thumb inju-
ry, while Sieg until recently has
been recuperating from presea-
son back surgery.

Tom Bill, Penn State's starting
quarterback at the beginning of
the season, will not recover from
a dislocated kneecap until next
week's game against Maryland at
the earliest, Paterno said.

Sacca took over for the injured
Bill in the 21-16 loss to Rutgers
Sept. 24 and has been the Lions’
starting quarterback since.

Sacca led Penn State to victo-

ries over Temple and Cincinnati
before losses to No. 16 Syracuse
and No. 19 Alabama. The Nitta-
ny Lions haven't scored a touch-
down in six quarters.

Penn State has defeated West
Virginia 28 of the last 29 years,
but Paterno said the Moun—¢
taineers were the big favorite
Saturday.

”This year, West Virginia has
much better personnel. We have
potentially good personnel, but
we're a year or two away.
They're there. They're there right
now,” he said.

LaRussa
named AL
Manager of
the Year

By Rick Warner

AP Sports Writer

NEW YORK 4 Tony La Russa,
who piloted the Oakland Athlet-
ics to a club record 104 victories
and the American League pen-
nant, was named AL Manager of
the Year Tuesday by the Baseball
Writers Association of America.

It was the second time La Rus-
sa wonthe award. He also was
honored in 1983, when he led
the Chicago White Sox to the AL
West title.

La Russa, 44, edged Boston
managerJoe Morgan by 14 points
in balloting by a committee made
up of two writers from each AL
city.’ La Russa received 103
points, compared with 89 for
Morgan and 37 for Sparky Ander-
son of the Detroit Tigers. '

Evans said he is,

”An injury obviously would
put us in tough shape,” he,added.

Enter the injury. Gilbert John-
son a 6-8, 225—pound forward
from Lees—McRae Junior College
in North Carolina, sprained his
knee in practice Monday, and his
condition will be re-evaluated at
5:15 p.m. today. Pending the out-
come of the examination, Evans
said Johnson could be out for the
rest of the year.

Johnson has the size to com-
pete in the Big East and would be
a valuable asset to a team limit-
ed in its number of big men. But
even if he is given the OK to play,
Johnson said that a previous in-
jury — a bone spur in his left
knee that is jutting into a tendon
— would definitely alter his play.

So Evans has been experiment-
ing with his frontcourt in practice,
putting Porter, 6-4, at small for-
ward and bringing 6-5 Nate
Bailey off the bench to the. pow-
er spot. Although the combina-
tion would allow Shorter and
Brookin to rest, it would also sig-
nificantly decrease an already

small lineup.

”The obvious problem is lack
of depth, and no size in the mid-
dle,” Evans reiterated. ”I think
Bobby Martin will be OK offen-
sively, I just don’t know if he can
stop Tom Greis, or stop some-
body 6-10, or 7-foot. Everybody
in the conference has got some-
body that size.”

The Panthers will find out ex-
actly how good their inside game
is even before the Big East season
begins. Pitt will play the likes of
Oklahoma State, which sports 7-4
center Alan Bannister, Florida,
with 7-2 Dwayne Schintzius, Ar-
izona and All-American forward
Sean Elliot and West Virginia,
featuring forward Chris Brooks.

Last year, the question was
”How far can Pitt continue into
the NCAA Tournament with the
play of their big men?”

This year, it may be, “How
many games can Pitt win in the
regular season without the
benefits of depth in the
frontcourt?”

”Now that I'm retired, I want
to be an actor. I've been studying
drama for 10 years, and I've been
dancing longer than I've been
diving,” he said, noting that he
read scripts between dives to re-
lax himself. ”I enjoy performing
on stage or on camera.”

And last night's audience obvi-
ously enjoyed Louganis, who dis-
played a humor and candor not
often associated with a world-
class athlete (Asked what was go-
ing through his head after crack-
ing it on the board in Seoul,_
Louganis said ”The diving

”You’re only a champion for a

the audience.

But the record book doesn't lie,

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, October 26, I988

Steelers flashy offense could change this week

By Alan Robinson
AP Sports Writer

A week ago, the Houston Oil-
ers taunted the Pittsburgh Steel-
ers with kisses, and Steelers
quarterback Bubby Brister criti-
cized his team for being too con-
servative and unimaginative.

Former Steelers quarterback
Terry Bradshaw questioned
whether the game had passed by
Chuck Noll,’who is 56 and in his
20th season as Pittsburgh's
coach.

So imagine Denver's surprise
on Sunday when Noll, who
-usually has no tolerance for tricks
and gimmicks, unveiled gadget
plays, wide-receiver reverses, the
no—huddle offense and a new
offensive backfield as the Steelers
beat the Broncos 39-21, ending

a six—game losing streak.

”This game was fun,” quarter-
back Todd Blackledge said. ”We
haven't had much fun for a
while.”

Noll, at his weekly news con-
ference Monday, said the gadg-
ets and gimmicks weren't
designed to loosen up the screw-
tight Steelers, 2-6, but were incor-
porated ”because we thought
they would work.”

Work they did.

Rodney Carter, usually a third-
down wide receiver, ran 64 yards
for a touchdown on the third play
of the game, his second carry of
the season. Carter, who ran for
110 yards and scored twice, set
up another score with a 16-yard
pass to fullback Merril Hoge.
Wide receiver Louis Lipps ran 23
yards on a reverse, and was sup-

posed to pass on another reverse.
These definitely were not the
same old, blase Steelers.

”We’ve had a lot of that stuff
in the game plan, but sometimes
you don't get to it,” Noll said. ’’It
wasn't just to have fun, because
fun is winning.”

The Steelers haven't done
much winning lately, either. They
were coming off consecutive
blowout defeats to Phoenix
(31-14) and Houston (34-14), a
loss in which several Oilers
ridiculed punter Harry Newsome
and tossed him kisses after block-
ing two of his punts.

”We were a down football
team, a depressed football team,”
Noll said, prompting him to tell
his players that ”the roads to
championships aren't smooth

roads, but bumpy roads.

”Their mental state was down,
and we had to do something to
pick that up. It was like heat-
treating steel.  It [losing] makes
you tougher and harder.”

The losing, and the criticism,
apparently fired up the Steelers.
They played with abandon and
aggressiveness against Denver,
and celebrated afterwards by
presenting Noll with a game ball.

”We gave it to Coach Noll be-
cause of all the flak he was tak-
ing, all the stuff in the papers that
he's not a good coach anymore,
that he's living in the ’70s,” safe-
ty Thomas Everett said. ”We
were mad.”

”We knew we were going into
a hornets’ nest,” Broncos coach
Dan Reeves said.

LaRussa—

place votes were Anderson, with
three, and Milwaukee's Tom Tre-
belhorn with one.

Each first—place vote was worth
five points. Second-place votes
were worth three points each,
while a third-place vote counted
as one point.

The A's improved by 23 victo-
ries in 1988 and won the division

i by 13 games over the defending

World Series champion Minneso-
ta Twins. They were heavily fa-
vored to win the Series, but were
upset in five games by the Los
Angeles Dodgers.

Oakland finished first in the
league in pitching with a 3:43»
earned run average, second in
homers with 156, and third in
defense. The A's won a franchise-
record 14 straight games in April
and May and set a Bay area atten-
dance record, drawing 2,287,335
fans to the Oakland Coliseum.

La Russa has a 752-683 record,
ori.524 winning percentage, in
10 seasons as a major league
manager. 2

Like a lot of successful
managers, La Russa was a medi-
ocre player. He had a career bat-
ting average of .199 in 132 games
as a utility infielder in the major
leagues.

A native of Tampa, Fla., La Rus-
sa made his big league debut at
age 18 with the Kansas City A's
in 1963. He played with Oakland
from 1968-71 and finished his
career with Atlanta and the
Chicago Cubs.

His managerial career began in
1978 when he took over the
White Sox's Class AA team in
Knoxville, Tenn. The team went
53-25, earning La Russa a promo-
tion to Chicago's coaching staff.

He was named manager of the
White Sox's Class AAA team in
Iowa in 1979 and took over the
Chicago job in August. The
White Sox finished -fifth that year
and the next, third in 1981 and
1982, and first in 1983.

The White Sox were tied for
first at the All-Star break in 1984
before plummeting to fifth. La
Russa was fired after the team
finished third in 1985 and start-
ed the next season 26-38.

La Russa joined the A’s on July
7, 1986, managing the team to a
45-34 record that season and
81-81 in 1987. He makes
$350,000 a year on a contract
running through 1989.
