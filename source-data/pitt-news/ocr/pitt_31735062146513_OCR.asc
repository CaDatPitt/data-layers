  PIIET, VISITS mam:

. “The Pittsburgh, Chronicle Tele-
graph,” of May 19, had the following
to say regarding Hervey Allen. Who
is probably best known to Pittites
of ‘his day as “Bill” Allen, (W, H.
Allen, Econ. ’15):
Hervey ~ Allen, the poet, spent
the week-end here as the guest
of Mr. and Mrs. Frank Moore
and -other friends; Since the
war, Mr. Allen has been living
in Charleston, S. ‘C., and while
tliere has published the books of
poetry and magazine articles
that have put him in the front
rank of American poets. His
“Blindman" and other war
poems were written in France,
where he was wounded while in
action. A

This poem was issued as a
special edition’ by The Yale Uni-
versity Press last year. It was
also commemorated by an an-
nual prize called the Blindman
prize, established through the
Poetry Society of South Caroli-
na. Mr. -Allen's “Wampum and
Old Gold,” one of the Yale series’
of younger poets, has had a rec-
ord sale, as has "Carolina Chan-
sons-,” which stood second in the
‘sales oi'_ books of poems publish-
ed in 1922-_‘

Other of Mr. _Al1en’s booksare
“Ballads of the Border Soldier,”
pomes written on the Mexican
border; “The Bride of Huitzi1l,”
an Aztec poem, and a new vol-
ume, now forthcbming, called
“Earth Moods.” Mr. Allen’s
work hasnot been entirely con-
ﬁned-to publishing. books of
poetry. His poems have also ap-
peared in the leading American
magazines, one of, them called
“Moments,” taking-“a, first prize
oﬁeredi by Contemporary Verse,
in 1922. ‘ _

9 Mr. Allen is at present assist-
ant editor of The Nleasure, and is
on the staff of -Columbia State
and other magazines and news-
papers as a reviewer. Mr. Allen
is also associated? with Robert
Frost, Vachel'g.Lind,say and Pad-
raic Colum‘ in The Open Road
Press, a unique endowed publish-
ing company, whose avowed ob-
-ject is to publish imaginative
interpretations of the home life,
physical, intellesctiial or spiritual,
of American individu'a-ls, either
in prose orpoetry. -Itsgaim isto

PITT PLAYERS CLOSE
SUCCESSFUL SEASON

The curtain that spread across the
last of the Pitt Players’ 1923-24 pro-
ductions last Wednesday’ evening

marked ‘the end of a Pitt dramatic
season that, according to authorities,
has had no equal. Enlarged member-—
ship,» a more extensive program, im-
proved stagings, ,a coach of ability,
and increased interest have all been}-
features of a yearthat has brought
the Pitt Players to the position -of a
major activity. A 9 ' T - ,
“Mr. Pim’ Passes By”, A, A. Mi1ne’s
brilliant three-act comedy. was the
vehicle Tuesday evening for a cast
that displayed unusual", ability, sus-

Paul C. Rupp-recht, -as Brian

Strange, a young lover, and Doris ‘
Rigby, as Anne, the maid, completed I

the cast. Both of these s.‘..1ould prove

useful in next year’s plays. 0
Wednesday evening's program of

three one-act plays included the first

play written by a Pitt student to be,

produced by the Pitt Players. This
was “The Magniﬁcent .Gesture”,"byL
Lucy Kennedy ’27. -In this play of

the French Revolution, [Richard Ha.-i

ka.nson, who played as Mr. Piiu in
“Mr, Pim Passes By”, achieved. an
artistic success as -the.-Vicomte do

Elmer G, Klaber as thelmagistrate;
and Betty Kammerer as Mother Ro-

work of merit.” 9' _ L

Alice Gerstepber-g’s “Fourteen”,
however, was the best -of the three
plays as far as acting was concerned.

version to the student. In addition

Education‘ Graduates
Can Receive ‘Positions

. Through Local Office

Correcting the general impression
that Pitt prospective teachers are
entirely dependent upon outside
agencies to secure positions, it has
been announced‘ from the School of
Education Office, that there , is‘ a
University Appointment Oﬂicef’ This
department undertakes to place
teachers "with the _various -high
schools in Pittsburgh and its en-
virons. I

Dr. C. W. Hunt of the Schoolof
Education has been in charge of the
Appointment Office as its director
for a number of years. Duringthe
last ‘year Douglas Waples has been
assisting Dr. Hunt in various phases
of the work. Mr. Waples has fur-
nished the following statistics as
evidence of what the Appointment
Office is accomplishing.

Since June 23, 1923, over 83 men
and women have completed the
course in the School of Education
and have practiced teaching. Of this
number, 40 have been placedto date
in junior and senior high schools,
chieﬂy in the suburbs of Pittsburgh.
Another twenty have come from
other colleges or are, for some other
reason, not dependent upon the Pitt
Appointment Oﬂice — for their posi-
tions. Others, numbering about
twenty more, have not yet been
placed, and of these half will prob-
ably enter some other ' profession,
while it is expected that the other
half will be placed within the next
few weeks.

The, Appointment Oflice also has
frequent occasion to place teachers
with previous experience.

CO-EDS OF 1927 ELECT

Lysbeth Hamilton received the elec-
tio of president of the‘ co-ed class

.HAso IT BEEN wean-ii WHILE?

As we depart from the campus this
year to take up our labors‘ elsewhere,
and probably never, to return as stu-
dents again, we ask ourselves the
question: Is’ a university education

personal and inquire: Has our period
of study at Ohio University better
ﬁttedus for our place in the world?
To such a query we unliesitatingly re-.

precious in actual achievement and

cries. Not for a moment have we re-
gretted -the «time we have spent at the
University. ' - * ’ . ‘

One of the most valuable accom-
plishments-to be secured from a uni-
versity education is the development
of‘ a sense of values.
there are numerous things to be done
on the campus. _‘ He cannot be- every:
where and cannot do them all. So he
must restrict himself and ask him-
self, ‘which--of these to apply. himself
to. ,5 If he is serious-minded and inter-
ested in doing, those things which will
cor.tributeKto his personality, he will
follow the paths that mean most to
him and thus develop a correct sense
ofvalues. Thatis the problem of a
lifetime-—to know what to do and what

‘ to neglect 'to do.

_ Another quality -to be gleaned from
a college education is i-poise. When
one comes’ in as a Freshman, he is
oftentimes confused and embarrassed
when he meets people/‘or stacks up
against problems. He may be enthus-
iastic, but he cannot direct his en-
thusiasm. He --applies himself but
still he wastes his time. He becomes
easily ﬂustered. He has little system
or organization to his worik- As he

however, he learns how to meet emer-.
genc-ie's,. and ﬁnds that a clear «head.
and a. deﬁnite plan are the greatest
assets to an. individual-that mere
energy is not sufiicientr ' » v
A person's - enthusiasm is not dulle

but increased by a college education.

It is. true that scientiﬁc explanations
tear‘ away the coat of romance that
covers several beliefs; but when mat-
ters are reflected on, the road is more
inspiring, than the old, because it rep-
resents truth and real achievement.
And somany new avenuesof interest
are opened up that have remained dor-
mant before.
real sense, a real romance. 'Onc’s in-
terest may be deepland yet more or
less universal. As a result of a ‘col-
lege education, a personcomes to.ap-
preciate the vastness of problems to
;be solved; and1i1'. he has the “stuff”
in him, his enthusiasm isincreased
thereby. ’ ' , ‘

There are many-other accomplish-
ments that a college education can
supply. But these aregthe ones which
stand out for us. And they certainly
are sufficient to justify a. college edu.

cation.-—Green and White.
LEARNING AND EARNING

‘fThe aim of a.-college education,”
declares‘? President Lowell of Harvard,

«inhis annual report, “should be some.-

thing ‘larger than a preparation for,
earning a living——it should be, not to
give students the technical ‘training
and tools of their future occupation,
but ~ra.ti1erto ﬁt them to be citizens,
to develop those qualities that lead.
to the better life both for -themselves
That this hu-
manistic conception of the purposes
of higher education is not confined -to

'H31'Vai't_1 alone among the great Amer-

ican un"ivel‘sities is borne out by the
following quotation» from  Henry
van Dyke of Princeton, who stated;

1“The ‘object of a college education is

not to enable a man to make a living,
but to teachghimphow to Ienrichhis
mental and moral life, to be more of
‘a man...-to be areal person and not a
mere cog in the machinery of indus-
try or trade.’’ Such deﬁnite state-
ments as these, coming as they do
from sources of the’ highest authority,
are offgreat signiﬁcance. They mean
thatthe demands of commercial suc-
cess and business” efﬁciency are not
to be allowed to destroy, the.__educa-

-tional stimulus of culture and the ,,lib- .

‘eral arts. = , . .
-There »are,. however, extremes to
which the -adherents: of this‘ (point of

commercialized outlook to which they
are opposed; A love, of lIe“ar.ning and

a cultural study of -the humanities
