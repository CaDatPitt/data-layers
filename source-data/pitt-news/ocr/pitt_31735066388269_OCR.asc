\\"hile a student group sold T-shirts with peace signs printed on
the front, former Attorney General Ramsey Clark told of the
horrors of a devastated Iraqi nation, demanding that President
Bush be impeached for being an imperialist.

Speaking last night to a full Teplitz Memorial Auditoriunt in the
Law School yesterday, Clark called the Bush administration an
“imperialist presidency" in violation of the Constitution.

‘An imperialist presidency violates the spirit of the Constitution
of the Ifnited States," he said, “and like war crimes, is an equal
offense. We must process an impeachment resolution against the
president of the ljnited States."

Clark said that the president was guilty of war crimes for
intentionally targeting civilians during the six—week~long war. lie
told the crowd of his trip to Iraq in early l’c-bruary.

“The. ljnited States delibc-ratelv attacked every urban center in
Iraq," he said. “'lhey were systematically breaking the country
down."

Although he said that nobody could be sure of the total count,
Clark said that over 25,000 Iraqi civilians were killed in the first
three weeks of the war.

“That is a violation of/trticlc S1 oftlic ljnited .\‘ations, statingthat

RSC not Worth ﬁnancial burden, SGB says

By Tammy Stradley
Sla_0’ Writer

The termination of the Representative
Student Council was discussed by the
Student Government Board at the SGB
meeting last night.

‘After a cost-benefit analysis and
assessment ofthe c0uncil’s effectiveness,"
said SGB member Gil Golden, “it is my
belief that RSC has brought about its own
demise.

“I-Iowevcr, I do believe that it’s a strong
indication of the current lSGB’sl successes,

and I feel that if there was a need for the
Representative Student Council at this
time, that it would, in fact, be strong.

“For now, I believe IRSCI has yet to
establish a current purpose to show their
interest in the board," Golden said.
“Without a doubt, the financial worth and
investment of this committee is just not
worth ISGBI time.”

Golden also announced the Commuter
Resource Center would cooperate with
the SGB to protect students from dishonest
landlords.

Plans may include a blacklist ofla ndlords

against which students have filed
complaints.

The final proposal for a professor and
cou rse~evaluation guidebook will be
presented to Provost Donald llendcrson
next week.

“I think there are a lot ofstrong arguments
in here,” said Golden.

“llopefully, we'll be able to win the
provost over to lSGI5’sl side, which I think
is the students’ side,” he said. Golden said
he wants the guidebook to be published
within a year.

In other business, SGB member Andrew

Gould finalized plans for the first off-
campus Crime Stop organizational
meeting, which will be held April 2, at 7
p.m. in I-‘orbes Quad Room IP36. The
residents of the 200 to _’>(>() block of
Oakland Avenue are asked to attend.

Crime Stop will also be introduced in
the freshman-orientatirin program to make
frcslttnan awa rc‘ of (TIIIIC—pf(?VCllll()3'l steps
taken by the university.

Results from a survey evaluating Crime
Stop were announced by Jenifer Crook,
student-relations committee chairperson.

Members of the Shriner fraternal
organization will vote March 25
on whether to accept an offer of
$10 million for the purchase of
the 81-year-old Syria Mosque.

The mosque is currently owned
by the Syria Temple, a branch of

known as Shriners, whose

The first week of late-night
study in the William Pitt Union
offered by the Student
Government Board was
successful, according to the SGB
president.

‘So far it looks positive,‘ said
SGB President Brent Saunders.
‘Students are using lthe union],
which is good. Not as many lused
the union for late-night study} as
we had hoped, but its right after
midterms, and it’s Greek Week,
so a lot of people are busy doing
other things.‘

Between 20 and 25 students

members total 13,000.

The Shrincrs, who are now
looking for a new location for
their meeting halls, have been
attempting to sell the mosque for
approximately 22 months.

National Development
Company, which has made the
$10 million offer, was one ofthc
first firms to express an interest in
the property when it was placed
on the market in June 1989.

showed up each night, which is
a good number of students,
according to Saunders. But he
would like to see more because
more rooms will be open up if
more students use the union for
late-night studying.

'I‘d like to see more people
using it because that way we
open the Schcnley Cafe area.
Then we can have a quiet room
and a group-protect room.”
Saunders said.

Saunders suggested that people
studying in the Cathedral of
Leaming use the union to study
now. ‘A lot of people start
studying in the cathedral, and it’s

Because the potential sale of
the mosque involves a fraternal

organiution must be the ones to
vote on the outcome.

Funds have been approved to
keep the union open for late-
night studying until April, The
university has offered to pay the
cost of keeping the union open,
according to Saunders, He said
that since the students pay tuition,
the administration feels that a
late—night study area is a basic
cost.

‘If students don't show that
they want it or that they need it.
it’s not going to be there,‘ said
Saunders. "\$*'e‘re not going to

Greeks race through area
in annual scavenger hunt

By Karen D. Speece
Senior Stalf Writer

Motorists driving through Oakland last evening had to stop
for more than the numerous red lights on practically every
block.

Cars screechcd to a halt as Greeks flocked across Forbes
Avenue, eager to be the first to return to David Lawrence Hall
with their bag of “treasu res” from the evenings scavenger hunt.

A clue which read, "Ihc only place on Forbes Avenue where
you can buy music in the desert,” led teams to the Oasis music
store on Forbes Avenue. “The preceding letters for this
establishment are SBAX" led them across Forbes Avenue again
to TCBY Yogurt.

Other area businesses involved with the pre—hunt chaos were
C]. Barneys, Roy Rogers and Metro Pizza. Hillman Library, the
Towers lobby and the home plate located in Forbes Quadrangle
were also stopping points for the Greeks as they raced through
the stations to get their list of 40 scavenger-hunt items.

A sample spoon from Baskin Robbins, an unbroken egg, 2
pool ball, a Snoopy pillowcase and the Sports Illustrated
swimsuit issue were among the items on the list that teams
dodged vehicles to gather.

The team of brothers from Phi Kappa Theta was the first to
return from the search. The actual winners of the event,
however, will be the top three point-scorers in each fraternity
and sorority

Two points were awarded for each item on the list that was
in the large. black garbage bags which members of each house
carried The first house to return was also awarded an additional
15 points.

Medical students learn future at Match Day

By Andrew S. Bruno
sagrwmer

Fourth-year students at the
University of Pittsburgh School
of Medicine learned yesterday
what the future would bring them,
as residency assignments were
announced during Match Da_y
activities

"This is the mother of all
parties,‘ saidjohn Waltz, a fourth-
year medical student at the
L'niversity of Pittsburgh.

The Association of American
Medical Colleges operates a
national computer program to
place students in residencies

pertaining to their interests.

Fourth-year students interview
at the hospitals of their choice in
the fall. The hospitals then rank
the students who are interviewed
in order of preference. The
students also rank their choices.
and the Association of American
Medical Colleges joins these two
lists and distributes the outcome
on Match Day.

Medical students throughout
the country amriously awaited
this day to see ifthey received the
residency of their choice.

Waltz received his first choice
as a radiology resident at the
L'niversity of Pittsburgh.

‘This is the happiest day of my
 Waltz said

Kevin Cregan received his first
choice of radiology at the
ljriiversity of Vermont.

‘This means that the past eight
years of hard work has really
paid 021'. All of the studying and
long hours has culminated into
this assignment,‘ Cregan said.
‘Sharing this day with your
classmates makes it even more
special.”

The feeling ofcamaraderie was
evident in the lecture room of
Scaife Hall, as the students
applauded when classmates’
names were called and their

assignments were handed out.

Phil Saba received his first
choice of child psychiatry at
Westem Psychiatric Institute &
Clinic.

‘This day is more important
than graduation. It determines
where you will live for the next
three to seven years,’ Saba said.

According to Suzie Hunt ofthe
Health Sciences News Bureau,
most students are paired with
one of the hospitals they prefer.

"Over the last three years, app-
roximately 80 percent ofPitt med-
ical students have received one
of their first three choices for res-
idency assignments,‘ Hunt said.

Study

Continued from page I
Saunders said there is another

reason he would like students to
use the study area.

‘If we can show a real good
support [in the union], we might
be able to put pressure on getting
the library to stay open longer,"
said Saunders. "That's my main
purpose."

Students are satisﬁed with the
new late-night study area.

‘I think it's a good idea,” said
Michael (Iuddy, a junior
psychology major. “I think once
it catches on, a lot more people
will participate. It's a good idea
to have something open later
than 11:30 [or] 12."

The library closes early, and

the cathedral is too dark for
studying, according to Marc
Battistone, a junior mechanical-
engineering major. Battistone
lives in a single room in Tower C,
but he went to the union on Mon-
day and Tuesday nights to study.

“I plan to use it every night,"
said Shelly Picard, a junior
political-science major. Picard said

civilians are not to be the object of attack,‘
he said.

Clark said that the L'nited States was
more guilty to invade Panama than Iraq
was to invade Kuwait.

‘During their occupation of Kuwait. the
Iraqis killed about 500 civilians.‘ he said.
‘The Americans killed at least 2,500 civilians
during their invasion of Panama.‘

Clark criticized Bush for his uncaring
attitude toward the Iraqi civilians. ‘The

president cares more about arms than he
does about infants.‘ he said

He said that during a tour of Iraq. he saw
several civilian vehicles in ruins, as weli as
Iraqi casualties. ‘But there was no military
presence to  seen," Clark said He said
he saw this during a trip from Basra to
Baghdad with a camera crew.

During that trip, Clark said that civilian
and public buses ‘littered the highway,
but there were no military vehicles
damaged." Clark said that this was one of

Bdshs ‘war crimes.‘

Clark said the cities and the Iraqi troops
were defenseless against American bomb-
ing raids ‘livery American knows that,‘ he
said. ‘IltI3,0-.10 sorties were flown over six
weeks. yet only 30 planes were lost.‘

According to Clark, no clean water could
be found in Iraq because ofthe bombings.
‘After Feb. 3, some 3,000 civilians had died
in im dysentery,‘ he said. ‘More than 20,000
had at least seen a doctor because of
dysentery and nausea.‘

Clark, who was the attorney general
under Lyndon B. Johnson. campaigned
heavily agaimt the Vietnam War as well.
He toured Vietnam in l‘)”?., but he said
that the destruction was nothing like that
in Iraq ‘In places like Hanoi and Haiphong,
there was only an occasional bombing
raid.’ he said. ‘In Baghdad and Basra, the
air raids were constant.

‘During the heaviest week of bombing
in Vietnam, 850 sorties were ﬂown. In the
first 33 hours in Iraq, 2,600 were ﬂown.‘

property last April, but according

to Tim Ziaukas, director of
communications for Pitt, the
university is ‘no longer
negotiating for the property."

According to Arbes, Pitt had
never been competitive in its
offers.

“lThe oilersl never developed
into full-blown negotiations
because the numbers just weren't
there,” said Arbes.

“I will say this, though. The
Syria Mosque has been very

Arbes added that there are
several ‘beautiful sites‘ in the city
and county under consideration
as the future home of the Shriner
organization, but he declined to
identify any of them.

In addition, the current sales
agreement states that National
Development has the option to
void the sale if it is discovered
that within seven months of the
closing, the cost of eliminating
hazardous materials, waste,
petroleum or asbestos materials
from the site exceeds $700,000.

The Syria Temple has agreed
to reduce the price to $250,000 if
the environmental-correction cost
is over $500,000.

The current agreement allows
the temple to remove such
personal propeny as the Sphinx
outside the building, selected
pans of the marquees, stained-
glass windows, a chandelier and
other items.

If within two years of a sale,
National Development decides
not to develop the property l)ut
instead sells the site to a third

party, it has agreed to equally
share any proﬁts it obtained from
the sale of the temple.

The Syria Temple has also
agreed to eliminate all leases,
including one currently held with
DiCesare I-ingler Productions.

DiCesare Iingler books concerts
and various other events at the

mosque.

The I)iCesa re Iingler lease runs
through July 1, 1993.

The lease requires the temple
or a buyer to pay it a penalty of
$200,000 if the Syria Mosque is
sold and/or demolished prior to
the termination of the lease
agreement.

The original ollcr made by

December 1989 was to demolish
the mosque, replacing it with a

   guilty of war crzmes .7. ..
 a last evening, former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey
  Clark called for President George Bush's impeachment,
 based upon evidence of war crimes and imperialism
  during the Persian Gulf war.
 Clark said that “an imperialist presidency violates the
   spirit of the Constitution of the United States, and like war
,;gcrimcs, is an equal offense.”
. S During a recent tour of Iraq, Clark witnessed severe and
  intentional destruction of civilian areas. This included
if  with heavily damaged civilian vehicles in places
where there was no sign of the Iraqi military. He said that
 thedcstruction of the civilians in Iraq violated the Geneva
1; 5 [f Convention. Clark's plea for impeachment really has no
 z . overall effect on U.S. policy, but he is correct that Bush's
 actions and the resulting casualties and atrocities of this
. _  { war must be investigated to find if any violations occurred.
 Bush apparently caused the unquestionable deaths of
{many innocent Iraqis without the slightest remorse or
 forethought in his ﬁght to liberate the oil fields of Kuwait.
 Therefore, we feel it is important that nationalism does
1] not silence objections to Bush's human-rights violations.
I S lt is up to the American people to demand this
llttvestigation of our country’s role in the war. The brave
soldiers who fought in the gulf are not at fault, nor should
their courage be questioned. ’Ihe ramifications of the
orders they were given by our military leaders should be.
 , The media of our country must also find the backbone
 and ethics they lost during the bombing. The media's
  McCarthyesque fear has pervaded the coverage of
, sittaations in the gulf. Instead of presenting what happens
5 to a city when it is bombed continuously, the media have
been content to sit back and let Nomtan Schwarzkopf
spoonfeed them charts that show why it was militarily
beneﬁcial to blow up a hotel. The military’s censored
media-pool agreement didn't help matters; the media
 seem to even question the president on this
violation of our right to know.

recommended  has ‘fun

 

This is in response to the letter
in the March l3. 1991, edition of
The Pitt News from Mr. Jim
Mc(Iann, concerning the 14
demands made by the Black
Action Society to the university.
’lherc were many things in Mr.
Mc(Iann's letter that disturbed me,
reading them as a concerned
black student, as an active
member of BAS, as a mentor for
incoming freshmen and as a
facilitator for the university's multi-
cultural exploration program.
Firstly, Mr. McCann, you stated
that BAS made demands, not
requests or suggestions, to the
university. Had you done a little
rcsca rch before writing your letter,
or had you even asked one of the
officers of HAS, you would have
discovered that on many
occasions [MS has made requests
of or suggestions to the university
concerning how to make this
racist institution -—-~ and believe
me, it is racist -—— a better place for
black students. If you would like
an example, look at the current
situation surrounding the
presidential-search committee.
BAS started off by pointing out
that noone student could properly
represent the diverse concerns
and interests of our large
undergraduate population and
requested that at least three other
undergraduate students (not just
black students) be placed on the
committee.‘IheBoardofTrustees
refused to see the importance of
such a request and BAS, as well
as the entire undergraduate
student body, was brushed off.
BAS then followed the same plan
you recommended in your letter,
‘... try a different approach,‘
which resulted in a march of over
200 concerned students. Yet and
still, even though we followed
the ‘proper channels and
procedures‘ (sending letters to
john Marcus and the former SGB
president, meeting with other
university officials, and voicing
our disapproval in a nonviolent

something‘ about the lack of
cultural activities for black
students, like ‘start new programs
on campus‘ and asked, ‘Is the
idea of actually doing something
on your own instead of whining
and complaining about it that
disturbing to you?‘ Well, Mr.
McCann, it is obvious that you
know little, if anything, about the
work that BAS has done this year
as well as in the past. BAS
organizes and implements
programs throughout the entire
year for its members, within
restrictions placed on the
organization by outside forces,
of course. However, I fail to see
how one week in November, and
one month, February, of activities,
with a few sprinkled in between,
is enough to provide any person
with enough cultural activities to
cover an entire year. ‘this year
BAS tried to increase the number
and variety of programs
sponsored, but there are financial
factors to be considered. BAS is
not asking that the university be
solely responsible for the activities
for black students -—— merely that
it become involved by helping
Bltswhenitcandonomore.
Another point you mentioned
wastheideaofthevantogofrom
Pitt to Homewood and East
Liberty -- you referred to this
demand as arrogant. Well, Mr.
McCann, there are no black
fraternity houses on University
Drive,inwhidtcasetheuniversity
does provide a shuttle for
smdents’transponation,andlhere
are none in North Oakland, in
which case the university also
provides a free taxi for students’
transportation. The same
treatment you may see as
‘preferential,’ I see as equal, but

isn’t that always the case. l...l

BAS applauded for its actions

remarks during the teach-in on
Feb. 20, as covered by Renee
Crcspy: I always thought joining
the military was a good dung if
one had no other options but still
wanted to have a ‘better life.”
Dennis Brutus scents to feel that
blacks are the only people who
joined the military as a last resort
to make an honest living or get an
education. I think not. There are
whites who have joined the
military to improve their lives as
well. The fact that Brutus says the
‘number of blacks in combat [is]
too‘ high‘ strikes me as racist. Is
Brutus insinuating that there
ought to be more whites in combat
than blacks? If all the people in
combat volunteered to fight in
the name of the United States of
America, than what does color

matter? ‘

Photography not impressive
l. ..l I enjoyed your showcasing
of the photographic artistry of
Jason Billings in your March I3,
1991, article about spring break.
What is difficult for me to
understand is how this amounts
to being ‘newsworthy.’ The
photos do not add to the article,
except perhaps to demonstrate
the quoted insight that much of
the entertainment in Florida (and
apparently in me Pm News) is
geared to males.l...l Like I said, I
don't mind the pictures, but your
paper should not be attempting
to emulate ﬁaorrslﬂuslmtai Nor
does it have to be dry, humorless

direct its news and entertainment

After a disappointing performance
against Slippery Rock on Tuesday, the Pitt
baseball team responded with a 843 victory
over Division II powerhouse Indiana
University of Pennsylvania.

The victory, the Panthers’ seventh in
eight games, lifted Pitt's overall record to
9-9 as the team readied itself for Saturday's
Big East opener against St. John's.

But the real story of the day was the story

Sprinter Ellis earns All—Amerz'ccm borzors at NCAAS

By Greg Wallace
sag Writer

As Pitt students were dragging themselves off the
beaches and heading back to Pittsburgh from
spring break two weeks ago, senior Elbert Ellis was
in Indianapolis at the Hoosier Dome competing in
the NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships
in the 55-meter hurdles.

Although Fllis’ time of 7.24 was not enough to
beat Washington State's Tony Li, his second—place
ﬁnish continued Pitt's tradition of excellence in the
hurdles.

Li tied former Pitt star and Olympic gold medalist
Roger Kingdom's NCAA-record time of 7.03 to take
the title. Many athletes would be happy with
second, but not Ellis.

‘Elbert wants to win," said track coach John
Vasvary. ‘I wouldn't say that he was entirely
happy, but he did what he could. Ile goes into
every event believing that he can win it all, and he
seems unsatisﬁed when he doesn‘t. There is no
reason for him not to feel that way, because he has
proven himself ." 1,

For his performance, Ellis became an All-American
again this season, making a clean sweep of the
honor all four years at Pitt. Last year he placed sixth
in the 55m event in the NCAAs.

Ellis is an eight-time Big East champion with
titles in the indoor 55m and the outdoor 400m
hurdles. Although he holds several school records,
the NCAA championship has always been a goal.

‘I knew that I wanted to win the event, and I
trained hard all year for it,” l-Illis said. ‘Everything
was together, including my concentration. When
the race came, I don't know ifl panicked a little or
maybe I was pressing too hard. It was frustrating.

‘Sometimes I get a little too relaxed,‘ Ellis said.
‘According to my coaches, I wasn't really into it
when the Big East Championships came around,

Despite recent criticism, Pitt seniors will always be winners

that never developed, as Pitt cancelled the
second game of a scheduled doubleheader
because of a lack of rested pitchers.

‘We are really beat up right now,’ said
injured pitcher Fred Iriti. ‘We've had eight
games in a week, and that really takes its
toll on a team. One of our pitchers quit,
and I'm iniured, so that limits our staff
considerably.’

The staff is so drained that Iriti said he
would test his knee this weekend, a week
before his expected return.

‘I'll try to give it a go,’ said Iriti, who

win in relief.

and it cost me. When the competition is better,
there is a difference. I seem to be a lot more
focused.‘

‘His competitors have to face him, and they
respect him,‘ Vasvary said. ‘He's a great athlete,
and he has worked hard for it because nothing
comes easy. One great thing about the
competitiveness in him is that he is always looking
to improve, and the good athletes do.‘

‘I feel very proud,‘ assistant coach Steve Lewis
said. ‘We're always pursuing excellence, and
excellence is first place. But Elbcn's effort was
excellent. There is a difference between losing and
getting beat. The potential that he demonstrated as
a freshman has tumed into actual fact.‘

Ellis’ experience and success have catapulted
him into the position as leader of the team. Although
he tends to shy away from leadership, here he
accepts it.

‘I usually don't like to have the leadership role a
lot of times,‘ Ellis said. “I've always learned from
everyone else. Some of the other athletes may look
up to me, but I look up to them at the same time.
I don't put myself above anybody else on the team.‘

‘He shows by example,’ Lewis said. ‘He reinforces
his experience in the younger athletes. Helping the
underclassmen is a tradition in our group, and he's
accepted the position as teacher, athlete and person. "‘

Ellis’ work ethic is not only seen on the track, but
in the classroom as well. The sociology majors
name has graced the Athletic Director's Honor Roll
on several occasions, and his sights are set on going
to graduate school to study education. ' H e '5
great to have around,” Vasvary said. ‘I Ie doesvcry
well in school as well as track. He's just a really
good person. Now, many people say that all the
time, but in lilbert's case it‘s really true. When
anybody on the team has a problem with track or
school, Elbert is always there to help out.‘

I didn’t get the opportunity to
watch Pitt's 77—66 loss to Kansas
last Saturday. Work, y’know. But
I'm not particularly upset.
Actually, it doesn't bother me at
all.

On Thursday afternoon, I sat in
the William Pitt Union ballroom
with a couple hundred members
of the student body, a few
administrators and faculty
members thrown in for good
measure. The nine~by-I2-foot
screen television there was as
close as I could get to Kentucky,
where the Panthers were playing
Georgia in a first-round 
Tournament game. And for better
or worse, this would be the last
go-around for Pitt's ﬁve seniors
(four plus Sean Miller, a junior
who redshirted last year).

I Sowiththetestoftheassembled

Panthers took a one~point

Georgia grabbed a 10-point lead
midway through the second half.
Even when Coach Paul Evans
inserted freshman guard Tim
Glover, who hit four NBA-length
three—pointers to put Pitt back in
the running, I still felt numb and
even a little angry. Evans had a
game to win, and he felt Glover
would best aid that end I saw
four years coming to an end, and
I felt cheated

Obviously, the Panthers won
the game. They could have lost
just as easily. And bearing that in
mind, I couldn't help but lean
over to a friend and ask, ‘Why
hasn‘t Evans put in all his seniors?‘

I suppose that might have been
a sign of defeat, a pink slip to
Jason Matthews, Bobby Martin,
Brian Shorter, Darelle Porter and
Miller. ‘This is probably your last
game, so get in there and end
your careers together,’ Evans
might have said. But. wherever

the Pitt basketball team has gone
over the past four years, it has
traveled with those five at the
wheel. And it should have been
those five who propelled the
Panthers to the second round or
back to Pittsburgh.

I'm not the coach, which I'm
sure bothers the playersand fans
very little. I didn’t have to deal
with Martin's four fouls, with the
presence of three or four seniors
on the bench at one time, with
Matthews’ poor shooting. I didn't
have to wonder about job security.
about the media scrutiny, about
the ‘underachiever" label so
readily leveled on this team.

Rugby is back after I 0-year absence

By Christopher Block
Suﬁ Wran-

Welt rugby fans. the waiting is
over. After a 10-year absence
from action at the Pitt campus.
rugby has returned to Pitt as a
Club-level sport with the
formation of the Panther Rugby
Football Club.

'I1'tis year’s team has already
played six games, and it has a
record of 1-5. In their victory, the
Panther players defeated a club
team from Carnegie Mellon

‘We are just trying to get
established. We have sortie
advanced players, but we also
have a lot of novice players too, "
said ﬂanker Jerry Harper “We
are currently trying to obtain
NCAA status."

According to john Lewis, a
back on the team, collegiate club
teams must have several years of

playing experience before they
are eligible for varsity status by
the .\'CA;\.

The team practices every
Tuesday and Thursday and has
games on Saturdays. This Saturday
zhe Pitt team takes on Indiana
I..'niversit_v of Pennsylvania

The practices are held on the
Cathedral of learning lawn, and
the team welcomes any potential
players who want to drop by and
watch.

HarperdescnbedthelL'Psquad
as a “well-established team.”
Besides this spring term, the team
also plans to have a summer
schedule. During the summer the
squad hopes to compete in a city
league.

One of the problems the team
has run into this year is that its
home games are held at Frick
Park.

Lacrosse team slumps ,

The Pitt Panther lacrosse team has stumbled into hard times
over the past week, dropping three of its last four games.

The Panthers journeyed to a tournament at the L‘niversity of
Butfalo last weekend. coming oil‘ a 13-4 shellacking of Kent
State and holding a perfect +0 record.

By the time Pitt left Buffalo, however, its record had

In their first game, against Division III power Genesso State
University. the Panthers w ere downed 12-8.

'Genesso was one of the better teams we've faced all
season,‘ Weber said "We played them tough  but they blew
us out in the third period," he said.

In its second game, Pitt fell victim to Fredonia State, losing

‘We started our third—stringers," Weber said. “Fredonia got
off to an early lead; [it was] fired up, and we couldn’t get back

In the final game, Buffalo outplayed and outhustled Pitt,
beating the Panthers convincingly 13-8.

‘We weren’t ready for that caliber of play,” Weber said.
"These three losses humbled us a little," Weber said.

ready."

liven though lillis shines now,
early in his career he needed the
encouragement of others to
develop in track.

“When I first started out, I
thought I stunk at track," I-Ellis
said. “'I'he pain was different
because I was a basketball player
and [had] a totally different
concept to understand. I had to

lfyou talk to I-illis' coaches and
peers, they would say that there
are two Iilbert lillises: Iillis the
mnner and Ellis the person.

“As a person, lilbert is
concerned about others," Lewis
said. “A teammate could be in
any situation, and Iilbert would
be there readily to offer any
assistance that he could."

“The coaches get on me
sometimes atxiut being a little
too nice,” Ellis said. “But that’s
just part of me. Sometimes I put‘
others’ problems before my own,
and sometimes that does hurt
me. Sure, there are times when I
can be mean, but that’s when the
athlete side of me pops out."

Heading into the outdoor
season and the commencement
of his career at Pitt, Ellis feels
everything is beginning to come
together.

“I'm getting there,” Ellis said. “I
ﬁnally feel to the point where
everything is starting to fall into‘
place. I don't get many injuries
anymore, and nothing hampers
me. All the hard work I've done
has been continually paying off.
I finally feel good."

amid the music of the Beatles and

born of the satin-jacketed disco-

“Its the nation's largest teenage
dance party. \3t"e’re in syndication
throughout all 50 states and some
of the Pacific Islands, like
American Samoa," said Chuck
Morris, the tall one.

“And Guam. All of the L'.S.—
owned territories,” said Chuck
Van Keuren, the cynical one.

'lhese two Chucks are the men
behind the controls of the only
talk-show/’music;tl head wound
at \\"l"l‘S.

“\X'e technically celebrated our
25th anniversary last year, but we
really started doing it last winter

infamous show aired on
Wednesday evenings from 9 to
11 pm. 'lhat’s 98.5 on your l~‘M

noted, “Chuck Squared is like
any other show at \‘t7’l"l‘S, only we
like to have fun, and we like to
play some fun things in addition
to the alternative format.”

These two cynical, satirical and
sarcastic guys derive a lot of

material from Pitt itself.

The typical Squared fan
envelops the same satirical nature
as the shows hosts and would
most likely wear the new Cher
cologne “or ‘.\'ew in Town,

Both Chucks snagged new
positions at \‘t"P'lS for next year:
\'an Keuren as music director
and Morris as program director.

“The only changes I plan to
make is to lincludel more
variation. \\"e‘ve had a very
narrow musical taste representing
our station," said Van Keuren.

“All groups are going to be
represented That would include
hardcore, industrial, standard
punk and popprogressive, which
has really been the most neglected
aspect of the station the last two
years. I personally don't like The
Cure, lll-ZM, the Smiths or any of
that ilk, but I think we should
have the opportunity to play it,”
he said.

Morris would like “something
you're not going to hear
anywhere else, like, say this
\\'restling record or the Styx
‘Domo Arigato’ record,” he said.
“livery other station is pumping
out the same four songs over and

puts very real problems and

Because this is a play about

well. It is witty, amusing and
moving, it builds very iiiteitsely.

movement she makes,
whether it is looking
hopelessly at a deck of
cards for her future ortrying
to balance her body on an
imaginary cliff to avoid
falling.

As Linda Rotunda, Eye
Piccioni relies heavily on
the stereotype of the fertile
ltalian girl from the Bronx.
Stereotypes are usually had,
but Piccioni takes a fresh
approach, adding sarcasm
and contemporary voice
inflections to her lines.

Overall, the actors have
mastered the dialects, and
with each line I felt more
like I had entered an actual
bar in the Bronx.

So if you want the
atmosphere ofa Bronx bar.,
the Point Park Theatre
Company has brought it all
to Oakland complete with
an lrish bartender and a
slew of life's more obvious
losers.
