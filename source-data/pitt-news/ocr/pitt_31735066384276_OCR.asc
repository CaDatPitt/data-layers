Tax Increase Passed

By MARK MURPHY
Pitt News Stall‘ \l\ rttcr ﬁnance
State Senate ended a
six-month legislative stalemate
yesterday by easily passing a
tax-hike bill needed to raise part of
the funds for state-related institu-
tions.
The bill, narrowly approved by
-the House Wednesday, will gene-
rate $157 million in new revenues,
which, when added to the pending
new tax on gross utility receipts
(worth $47.5 million) and cuts of $82

million.

the bill next week.

some $285 million in
appropriations to state-related uni-
versities. Pitt would receive $61.

Gov. Shapp is expected to sign

Rep. Fred A. Trello (D-Corao-
polis) cast the decisive 102nd House
vote on the measure, which will
raise the personal income tax rate
from 2 percent to 2.2 percent, and
the corporate net income tax rate

Shapp to Sign Next Week

After the first tally fell one vote
short, 101-98, dissenter Trello was
the subject of almost an hour of
intense pressure from House
leaders and other Allegheny County
lawmakers. When the second vote
was taken, Trello switched his vote
from “no” to “yes,” giving the
House its constitutionally-mandat-
ed two-thirds majority.

Chancellor Posvar was unavail-
able for comment, but his executive
assistant, Edward Bozik, said
yesterday:

‘,‘We are pleased the Legislature
passed an appropriations measure
that will go a long way to solving our
ﬁnancial problems. We
delighted the Legislature has acted
in the spirit of compromise in
settling part of the problem.”

Besides Trello, 10 ‘other House
members changed their votes on the
tax matter, helping to end the
deadlock that has forced.Pitt, Penn
State, Temple and Lincoln to go
heavily into debt. By last week, Pitt
had borrowed $14 million.

are‘

Allegheny County Democrats
joining Trello in voting “yes” for
the first time were George
Miscevich of Elizabeth, Bernard
Novak of West Mifﬂin and A.J.
Valicenti of North Versailles.
County Republicans joining the
pro-tax forces were James W.
Knepper of Carnegie and H.
Sheldon Parker of Mt. Lebanon.

‘ ‘The spirit of compromise ﬁnally
was agreed upon,” Bozik said, in
explanation of the vote changes.

Dave Hesidence, Jan Medoff, Sam

Popko, Sharson Starzynski and Cleo
Sumpter.

Max Lash and Dave Garger,
despite turning in peitions before
the deadline, will go before the
SGEC today to learn whether they
will be officially placed on the
ballots.

The meeting will center on
whether Lash, a presidential
hopeful, and Garger, a current
board member seeking re-election,
meet election code requirements
that mandate candidates be enrol-
led as full-time undergraduates for
at least one year after the SGB
election date (Jan. 19).

According to transcripts filed by
Garger and Lash, each could
accumulate enough credits to
graduate before their SGB tenure
would expire in January 1979.

Should Lash be denied a ballot
position, it would change the
makeup of one of two slate of
contestants: Lash, Behers, Brown,
Galanski and Sumpter. Also
running jointly will be Baylson,
Hesidence, Berl and Starzynski.

Of the eligible candidates,
Baylson, Berl and Hesidence are
incumbents. Sumpter ran unsuc-
cessfully for the board last year.

Campaigning officially begins
today. Elections will be held Jan.
18-19. Polling areas are the Student
Union, Towers Lobby, Benedum
Hall, Cathedral ground floor,
Lothrop Hall and David Lawrence
Hall.

Inauguaration will be Jan. 30.

Payne: No Second Term

By RICH HARRY
., re 1- Pill News Stall‘ Writer
7 Student Government Board observers were surprised recently by a
signature appearing on the list of students planning to petition for
positions on next year’s SGB.

Among the two dozen or so signed names was that of Bernie Payne,
who late next month will be succeeded as president of Pitt’s
undergraduate student body. .

“I seriously considered re-running for president,” Payne said
yesterday. “I promised sonie friends I’d take out a petition. I talked to
several persons about it, including my family in Donora.” I

Payne saw his chances for re-election as ‘ ‘excellent, ’ ’ due in large part
to his incumbancy.

But after week-long consideration, Payne vetoed the idea, opting for
what he sees as ‘ ‘new horizons,” and a political career he hopes will lead
to a government position at the state or county level.

“I left my mark. I left my contribution. Now it’s time to move on.”

Reﬂected in Payne’s tone is his belief he has been effective in his
year-long tenure as SGB president.

_ Payne, who said he would have postponed his graduation and taken
. ‘iifﬁough credits to make himself eligible, said SGB now is a ‘ ‘legitimate’ ’
 student organization in the University’s decision-making hierarchy.

“Our programs are moving—the Undergraduate Academic Review,
the faculty English competency requirement, our relations with the city
and Harrisburg. '

“I think I showed how dedicated I can be to something...no’one can
say I didn’t put myself into what I was doing.”

And, as to what he considers to be the ' board’s principal
accomplishment this year} “Student government has expanded to
working with student organizations inside and outside Pitt. We’ve dealt
with people who affect us, state and city government, for example.
“Before, student government was considered an afterthought,” Payne
said. “But now, it’s a forethought.”

Students, Architect Talk

By SUE McFARLAND
Pin News Stall Writer

Urban Design Associates, arch-
itectural ﬁrm, discussed possible
remedies to problems of trafﬁc
congestion, poor parking and
neighborhood-University relation-
ships at a Wednesday meeting with
Pitt student representative.

At the meeting, several Pitt
students were asked why they chose
to attend an _‘ ‘ Oakland institution, ’ ’
where they go for recreation and
what they believe to be Oakland’s
major problems.

Student Government Board
member Josh Baylson cited what he
believed to be major problems from
the students’ point of view,
including overcrowding, transit and
high rent.

“But number one on the list,”
Baylson said, “is the fact students
are not respected in Oakland. In
Shadyside or Squirrel Hill, you are
appreciated, and are not looked
upon as someone who is trying to
take away something.”

Baylson said this is a possible
reason graduating students relocate
to other areas of the city, rather than
remain in Oakland.

To alleviate the problem of
unattractive buildings and dirty
streets, Baylson proposed a pro-
gram whereby the city would clean

- up and rebuild one Oakland block in

the hopes other residents, landlords
and businessmen also would
improve their properties.

Former Inter-Fratemity Council
President John Powers spoke on the
relationship between the Bayard
and North Dithridge Street fratem-
ities and their neighbors.

~LocaI Urban Problems

“We have had problems in the
past, such as the recent ones on
Bayard Street. But in this case, you
are talking in terms of maybe ﬁve or
10 people complaining from a
community of thousands. In my
opinion, the sense of rapport that
exists on the fraternity streets does
not exist anywhere else in the
community. ”

The information compiled from
this and over 100 similar meetings
with students, residents and
businessmen from Oakland will be
incorporated in a “Plan for a Better
Oakland,” to be submitted to the
City Planning Department in April
1978.

According to Raymond L. Gind-
roz, a partner of the Urban Designs
Associates: “In these early stages,
we are trying to reach out to and
meet with the people to see what the
real issues are, so the ﬁnal plan of
the city will not be ours, but will be
that of the people.”

Gindroz said in early September,
a rough copy of the plan will be put
before a public forum for amend-
ments and alternations. At this
time, representatives from each of
the involved groups (students, resi-
dents and businessmen) will be
asked to serve on task forces
concentrating on one area of
interest under study.

“We don’t want community
groups to be against each other, or
the community to be against the
University,” Gindroz said. “The
single most important factor in
making this plan is cooperation and
talk between the students and the
community.’ ’

 

Oakland’s urban woes was the subject of a meeting Wednesday between Pitt
student representatives and a local architect firm.

Many students have begun to eat hot soup—-even at local
bars as in this case—in an attempt to battle the cold

days.

Tax Bill Clears Senate;

“The Legislature wants a solution,
and the state needs a solution.

on House members.”

For his deciding vote, Trello was

From his
new position, Trello said he would
investigate expenditures by ranking
adminisitrators of Pitt and other
state-related universities, citing the
“gross injustice” of college presi-
dents having “free summer homes,
mansions, chauffeur-driven lim-
ousines and exorbitant ‘salaries of
$100,00 or “more.” (In 1975, Pitt’s
Chancellor Posvar was reported to
be earning $65,000 annually.) Trello
also criticized universitites ‘for
spending large amounts of money

“We have been accused of not
being good enough lobbyists, and,
on the other hand, we’re told we are
spending too much on it. All the
universities have legislative lai-
sons, and that is an importar’
function, if only for informational
purposes. The Legislature depends
on it.”

Should Pitt soon receive its
appropriation, the first order of
business would be to pay back its
massive ‘loans. But before the
University can receive its money,
the House" must approve the
Senate-passed utility tax and
budget cuts, and the Senate must
ratify university appropriations.

“We would pay off the debt
immediately with the money that
comes,” Bozik said. “That would
include interest charges, too. The
appropriation makes no provision
for money borrowed or interest-

paid. We’re hoping the Legislating A

comes up with some extra money.”

CAS P|us/ minus Grades
To Appear Th is Term

By DAVE STERN

Students in the College of Arts
and Sciences may have a surprise
in store when they receive their
grades for this term. A grading
system allowing faculty of the

College to attach a plus or minus.

sign to ﬁnal grades will go into
effect for the first time in a decade.

1 Last winter, the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences voted by mail ballot to
reestablish the plus/minus grading
system.

At a meeting two years ago, CAS
Council rejected plus—minus grad-
ing system.

“It's one of the cases where the
CAS Council rejected an idea
principally to student- inﬂuence,”
said CAS Dean Robert Marshall.

“But the faculty can overturn the
council’s decision,” Marshall said.

According to FAS Dean Jerome
Rosenberg, FAS supports the

plus/ minus grading system be-
cause it better indicates a student's
academic performance, and curbs
grade-inﬂation.

“Some faculty members felt the

JEROME ROSENBERG

need to have a ﬁner grading
system, because the five-point
system is not enough,” said
Rosenberg. “It’s clear it will
beneﬁt the students in giving a
more detailed picture.”

CAS Council had opposed the
plus/minus grading system on the
grounds it would intensify grade-
consciousness, and that its usage

by some faculty members might.

result in bias.

“I voted against it,” said
Marshall. “I don't want to increase
grade consciousness, for true
growth is something that takes
place without it. I believe in the
evaluation of students as -an
importantpart of development, but
too much grade-consciousness can
get in the way of education.”

Nine of 16 colleges in‘ the
University incorporate a plus/
minus grading option. FAS grad-
uate programs, the School of
General Studies and the School of
Law (beginning with the class of
1981) are inacting the option this
term. B

The system will continue in
CAS, although it could be
discontinued by a future vote.

“ 72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

Try to Remember

yesterday, the state Senate approved a tax hike previously
passed by the House and Christmas came a few weeks early for
students, faculty and employees at state-related.universities. But
before Santa can deliver the goods—in Pitt's case, $61.7

.million—-both chambers of the Legislature must approved $82

million in budget cuts and a tax on gross utility, the Senate must

‘approve the actual university appropriations. Fortunately. these

final measures soon should be on the governor's desk for signature.

The months-long process of budgeting appropriations for state-V
related universities has been a bitter and damaging struggle. in
August, the Legislature succeeded in severing so-called non-
preferred appropriations from the general state budget, effectively
casting the universities in the role of villian in the tax hike scenario.
Since then,.a minority of legislators have held Pitt, Penn State,
Temple and Lincoln hostage, forcing the schools to borrow and
pay interest on vast sums in order to keep classes open. The result
will be higher tuition next year. t

As this year ends, another election year begins. During the past
several months, more than a few legislators decided to make them-
selves attractive to their constituents by taking stands that were not
in the best interests of higher education. We only hope Pitt studen-

Letters To The Editor

Black Studies a Different Kind of Department

The letter written by Martin
Staniland appearing in the Dec. 7,
issue in my estimation raises some
serious questions. The letter was
written in response to charges
made by Curtiss Porter concerning
the racism that exists at this

‘institution and that have surfaced

repeatedly in his interactions, as
chairman of the black studies
department, with Dean Jerome
Rosenberg. These interactions
have included the Dean’s decisions
and procedures in the tenure
review cases of two of the
department's members. Mr.
Staniland has completely dis-
regarded the examples of racist
behavior outlined by Mr. Porter.

By stating that the _department
demands to be dealt with by a
different set of standards in its

tenure decisions, he has overlooked
two very important points concern-
ing the black studies department:
1) The department has been in
existence for a mere eight years.
Its formation and development as
an academic discipline has
required great time and effort. 2)
The department is not only an
academic branch of CAS, but has a
direct responsibility to the black
students at this university as well
as to the black community.
Because of the differences in the
goals and aspirations of the
department and its level of
involvement with the community, it
does not seem outrageous that
considerations be made for the
tenure qualiﬁcations of its faculty.
Mr. Staniland also states that the
black studies department “has

said, and that was that. Bridge
game in hand, she ﬂipped the cards
on the table and leaned back in her

chair, grinning.
Later, sitting in my parents’
living room and listening to music

' for the dentist's office on WSHH,

there was time to reﬂect on the
day. Prior to the bridge game, the
four of us——my parents, Patsy and
I—had spent the entire Saturday
afternoon wandering through
downtown Pittsburgh, Christmas
shopping. It had not been a bad
day, as days spent shopping go.
We even had found a few things.

Now, the sound spilling from the
radio demanding no entry into
consciousness, my thoughts were
drawn to something I had observed
time and again that day. At Saks

“deferred billing.” In nearly every
large store, consumers were
encouraged.to buy now, pay later.

“It’s getting to be a celebration
of credit down there,” I said,
noting that a few weeks earlier
Gimbel’s had called Patsy and
asked whose name we would like
on the charge account they wanted
to send us. “Nobody’s going to tell
me those stores aren’t turning a big
proﬁt by offering these so-called
conveniences to customers.”

My father, having heard this sort
of thing before, responded quickly
and predictably.

“Of course it's proﬁtable. That’s

the system.” Having let loose the

prospect of another long and’

fruitless argument over the relative
merits of “the system,” he leaned
back on the couch and looked at me
out of the corner of his eye.

As usual, I took the bait. “And
it’s a perfect example of what's
wrong with the system,"- I said.
“Charge accounts, deferred billing
—-all this buy now, pay later
crap—it just encourages people to
spend money they don't have.
More than that, it encourages
over-consumption. It’s the Ameri-
can Dream to get something for
nothing, even if ‘nothing’ really
mans ‘pay later.’ People snap it up.
They buy non-necessities like
crazy, resources get used up, we’re
up to our ears in discarded junk,
and the bills come in a month too
late to stop it."

Dad just sat there, perhaps
thinking I was beginning to get
carried away, perhaps waiting, as
he sometimes does, for me to talk
myself into a comer.

“You’ll probably say nobody’s
forcing anyone to buy," I con-
tinued, trying, in the midst of his
silence. to anticipate the objections
of a believer in the system.
“You're right, or at least half right.
Advertising and our consumer
culture do exert some pressure,
you know. But nobody’s twisting
any arms. If nobody used charge
accounts, the stores wouldn't have
them. The people must like them.
Freedom of choice and all that."

He just kept staring at me.

“But that implies a rather
limited view of responsibility,
doesn't it?" I was pressing..taking

visi-

advantage of my uninterrupted
monologue. “Why should the
development of responsible con-
sumption patterns be left solely to
the customer? What about the
stores? If over-consumption is
irresponsible, so isover-production

-and over-marketing. Sure, a buy

now, pay later policy is a
convenience, but it’s over-market-
ing. Hell, it's marketing‘ materi-
alism. And as far as I’m concerned,
materialism is not a very healthy
basis for economic interaction,
even if it is the one we use.”

The expected response still was
not forthcoming. I had lectured him
about charge accounts and de-
ferred billing, and he’d hardly said
a word. Now the ideological
generalization was out—“material-
ism is not a very healthy basis for
economic interaction”-—and he
usually jumped on that. But
instead, he said, “Just because you
won't get a charge account doesn’t
mean you’re not paying for the
privilege just the same.”

“Yeah. I know," I said. not sure
whether he was supporting me or
arguing with me. “And people a lot
worse off than me. people who
couldn't get a charge account if
they wanted one, they're paying
too. Some freedom of choice. How
good is a system that makes the
poor pay credit costs for the
bourgeoisie?"

Then it came. It had been waiting,
like it always does, like a stone set
up on the tracks; waiting to derail
my argument. Simply. directly, his
eyes ﬁxed on mine. he asked,
“What's your alternative?"

And that was that. It was all

all tactical sense.” He does not,
however, substantiate this sarcasm
by naming any of these instances.

Finally, he wants to know how
many white faculty members exist
in the black studies department.
The answer, quite obviously, is
none. After all, how many men
teach women's studies? But Mr.
Staniland labels this as “reverse
discrimination.” A more concrete
issue is how many blacks exist in
other departments of the Univer-
sity. The answer is 10. Now if you
want to discuss discrimination,
let’s be for real!

there in those three nagging words:
trickle-down theory, utilitarian
arguments of the greatest good for
the greatest number of people, jobs
generated by consumption, con-
sumption generated by marketing,
even the force of tradition. I had
heard it before—economic interac-

you don't have an alternative. And
neither does anyone else.

revelation of sorts. It was one of
those moments when, for no
apparent reason, some dim half-
thought suddenly breaks into bare
and gleaming lucidity. It's a lie, the
revelation said. That old conceptual
scheme is a lie. You call youselves
beneﬁcent, with your enlightened

After returning from Harrisburg
on Tuesday, Nov. 15, I intended to
compose a letter blasting the
legislators for screwing up this
year’s state budget and criticizing
the combination of student govern-
ments from the four state-related
schools for their seemingly low
level of cohesion and effectiveness
in lobbying for state appropria
tions. I began drafting the letter
while some frinds and I were
talking about the budget crisis.
When I told them I had finished
they asked to hear what I had
written, and Iobliged them. As it
turned out, their commemts and
proved to be more
interesting than my letter.

One of the first criticisms raised

was that the students of Pitt, Penn
State, Temple and Lincoln do not
really have strong leverage over
the legislators and that this
handicaps any effort to push the
legislators into making a decision.
It seems as if all those persons
living in Pennsylvania with a
concern or vested interest in the
institutions of higher learning have
urged a speedy resolution to the
appropriations problem. After
much discussion of this issue, one
of the remaining problems in my
mind is, what else can be done to
get money from the state if a
strong, ongoing effort is indeed
being made? After all the pressure,
why hasn’t a decision been made,
and how much longer can we afford

to wait for it? I want to provide an
answer that would end this
problem in a day or a week, but
what can I say that hasn't been said
already? I only can offer sugges-
tions.

Both my friends and I agree that
the only tangible power students

have, in terms of state appropria-'

tions, is the power of the vote
(somewhat premature as this is not
an election year, but perhaps still
valid). The three of us are fairly
sure that money for the 1977-78
ﬁscal year is forthcoming, but we
also are thinking ahead. We

reasoned for next year’s appropria-
tion decision and those in the
future. -

In our attempt to arrive at viable

solutions, my two friends and I also
discussed the semi-violent type of
student radicalism rampant during
the 1960’s. It was felt that in the
long run, this technique might lead
to no beneﬁcial end and only would
serve as ammunition against
student lobbying efforts. Besides,
who the hell wants to tangle with
the National Guard if our actions
become misperceived or distorted?
Unfortunately, our lack of leverage
will be our greatest handicap, now
and in the future. I

If the only leverage students
indeed have is the power of the
vote, let them take special note of
the legislators and where they
stand. The Task Force's student
lobby coordinator has been asked

to compile a list of this information.
If students do not know who their
legislators are, I urge them to ﬁnd
out. One of the friends involved in

the discussion of my intended letter"

suggested a mass voter registration
of University students in an effort
to create a statewide voting block. I
ﬁnd this an excellent idea, and

encourage students to keep it in _

mind. Another suggestion, I aimed
at both present effort and long
range goals, is to upgrade our
methods of stressing the impor-
tance of institutions such as Pitt,
Penn State, Temple and Lincoln,
and to educate Pennsylvanians as
to why their tax money should be
directed to these institutions.

Aquettes Syncronize

By ANGELA VAVITHES
The Pitt Aquettes, a syn-
chronized swim club, held a

demonstration of basic skills
Wednesday night at Trees Pool.

The demonstration acquainted the

public with many of the strokes and
stunts (ﬁgures) of the sport.

Synchronized swimming is much
like ice skating or gymnastic ﬂoor
exercises, except it is performed in
a liquid environment. The object is
to combine stroking, body patterns
and ﬁgures with music.

Until about seven years ago,
synchronized swimming was a
varsity sport at Pitt. At that time,
the athletic department withdrew
its financial support of the team.
The Aquettes then became a club,
relying on the Student Government
for support.

Last year, the Aquettes com-

Swimming Endeavours

peted with colleges from Pennsyl-
vania and Ohio. Despite a very
good year—they ﬁnished second in
the state meet—they will not
compete this year, due to ﬁnancial
obligations.

Finding enough
always has been a problem for the
Aquettes. Each routine involves up
to eight people; the club needs
more swimmers to execute the
routines that will be featured in its
winter water show. It now has ﬁve
returning swimmers: Mary Ellen
DeMay, Susan Wheeler, Wendy

Bissel, Gin Sweeney and Michele :

Landy, and two new swimmers,
Cris Andreas and Kathy McCauley.

After the pre-season demonstra-
tion, advisor Virginia Grindle said,
“The girls looked very good, and
handled themselves professionally
when we had trouble with the
sound. We just don't have enough
people.”

Hall and Oates -- Two Nights of Great Blues

By PHILIP SCALAMOGNA
Pitt News Stat‘t”‘Wriler

The weather was cold, but it did
not freeze the enthusiasm of the
fans who ﬁlled the Stanley Theater
Wednesday to see Darryl Hall and
John Oates.

The fans cheered when the sax
player opened and the low, rich
sound ﬁlled the theater. Then
Oates came in on the guitar, clad in

lustrous gold-colored slacks. Hall
and the rest of the band emerged,
and they swung into gear.

The band created a spectacle of
color, music and motion. The lights
changed colors and reflected on the
big metal star on stage, while Hall
moved and twisted with the
intensity of the sound, reaching
way back to hit the soprano note"

The song “Rich Girl” was well

Pitt News Staff Writer

This space was to be ﬁlled with a
“best LPs of 1977” piece. But, with
all due respect to this year’s best
albums, this writer feels a need to
make a more pertinent end of ’77
comment. Besides, it is useless to
heap more laurels on the likes of
Fleetwood Mac or Linda Ronstadt;
they are top-heavy with them.

The record industry is booming.
More albums are being produced
and sold than every before. More
new artists are recording and more
new record stores are being built.

And the success of the record
industry ‘is mirrored by a diverse
and dynamic array of recording
artists. The bounds of marketable
contemporary‘ music are swelling
with new and different genres of
music. Rock’n’roll has blended with

. other musical forms, while some of

    
 
    
 

those forms have found wide
audiences of their own. ‘

In general, the record market-
place has been left intact by a
sluggish economy, and album
purchases continue on the up-
spring. However, all this good
fortune is a two-edged sword.

The record industry’s success
has created a funneling effect in FM
radio. Once bastions of the new,
progressive and experimental, FM
stations today are the promoters of
an increasingly closed set of
musicians.

The new FM philosophy is simple
(and simple-minded): people want
to hear what is big. What is it to be
big? To sell a lot of records, to be
well-liked, to satisfy the type of
audience that is listening to -FM
these days. Yes, the FM stations
ﬁnally have ﬁgured out who has

received by the audience, as was
the bluesy-sounding “Do What
You Want to Do.” The guitar work,
headed by Oates, was crisp and
sharp. Oates’s vocals had a
character altogether different from
Hall's, yet when the two sang
together, they produced a nice
harmony.

The two musicians received
ovation after ovation as they swung
into their greatest hits. During
“Sa.ra Smile,” a girl struggled
through the crowd to hand roses to
Oates. while two fans displayed a
Hall and Oates banner.

On “Back Together Again” Hall
urged the audience to clap along,
and they obliged. The rich
saxophone work shone here.
Another hit, “She’s Gone” also
was well-received by the crowd.

Toward the end of the concert,
the band let loose with some hard
rocking, jumping and moving. The
spotlights changed, the metal star
ﬂashed, and the fans responded.

The crowd stood and cheered for
two encores.

On the whole, the band put on an
impressive show, showing the
musicians’ expert fusion of rock
and soul. Hall V and Oates’s
Pittsburgh concerts (Dec. 6 and 7)
were recorded and will be placed
on a live album.

Also appearing was Lake, a
relative newcomer to the music
scene. The group displayed a hard
rocking sound,with heavy empha-
sis on guitar. Its rendition of “I’ve
Got the Music in Me” got the
biggest response from the crowd.

been listening to them all these
years. The audience may have been
younger in the past; today, it is an
older (20 plus) audience with
conservativetastes and an intoler-
ence for divergence from the norm.

The FM programmer says, “X
sold 2 million copies of his album, so
the people must like X, and
therefore will like X’s next release,
(and musicians who sound like X,
too).” Radio has forgotten that its
own assessment of what will be
played ﬁgures considerably in the
success or failure of the musician in
question. This makes for’ a vicious
circle: to be played you must be a
success, to be a success you must be
played. Consequently, struggling
new musicians remain struggling
new musicians. Few new acts are
broken.

Additionally, FM radio is in the

JOHN OFITQS

bind of being more responsible to
sponsors than ever before. This
means FM radio fears losing
listeners and is apprehensive about
deviating from a ﬁxed type of
programming. Playing it extra safe
has become the rule.

Then, there is the FM program-
ming service, whose southern
California “expert” decides what
people around the country want to
hear and will hear. (Imagine the
uproar this would have caused 10
years ago!)

The fall of open and progressive
FM radio has been sadly witnessed
in our city. Old stations have
adopted tight programming sched-
ules (some suscribing to the
services described above), while
many new Pittsburgh-area stations
have been rigid programmers since
their inception. Two of the

Entnmet Guide

newcomers easily could be mis-
taken for AM stations; it isn’t hard
to imagine an FM top 40.

It is the end of 1977, a year that
has been musically exciting from a
variety of perspectives. But FM
radio has failed to monitor that:
excitement. Instead of the new,
they have given us the old. Instead
of the fresh, the recycled. Instead of
the genuine, the imitative.

FM radio now has committments
to sponsors, pet artists, and the
ﬁctitious average listener. Until FM
radio realizes that its duty is to
music, not to a certain audience or
to lucrative advertising deals, music
lovers (particularly rock lovers)
should dig in with their favorite

albums, and use their tuners for,

news and sports only. In its presell; _
state, FM radio isn’t worth wasting
electricity on.

Oh, God. Chatham. God (George
Burns) appears to a store manager
(John Denver). Good.

Will Camegie-Mellon Spit Into the

ByJIMPANE
l’itt News Staff Writer

With six games played this year,
the Pitt Hockey Club has yet to raise
its head above water. Though the
Panthers’ inability to crack the .500
barrier has turned a few heads,
coach Len Barcalow isn’t ready to
push the panic button.

“Sure We’re ashamed of our
record (2-4) thus far,” he said, “but
then again, we’ve played some
tough teams. We’re not ready to
rush things at this point, though. I
said before our last road trip that
we’d be happy with a split, and
that’s what we got. We’re coming

along nicely, and I’m conﬁdent
we’ll win our next one.”

Pitt’s next one—or four— will be
crucial in setting the stage for the
remainder of the season. After
tangling with backyard rival
Carnegie-Mellon at the Civic Arena
Sunday (1 p.m. faceoff), the
Panthers will begin preparations for
their annual three-game stint in
New York City. Last year's trip
netted a three-game sweep, thanks
to Curt Hetz’s goal with one second
left in the third contest.

But Barcalow isn’t looking ahead
to New York, yet. His emphasis
remains on the C-MU encounter,
which in the past has resembled

nothing less than a pro wrestling
battle royal.

It all started three years ago,
when Tartan Dave Cormelias’ split
somehow found its way to Panther
Charlie Hagan’s face. Pitt won the
ensuing ﬁght, as well as the game,
but Barcalow still had some things
on his mind after the war was over.

“I went into their locker room
after the game,” Barcalow said,
”and I told them, ‘You guys have a
good team, but just remember—
there’s a school on the other side of
Forbes Avenue, and you ain’t never
gonna beat us.”

Such a bold promise is usally fuel
for the other team’s emotions when

the next match-up rolls around, but
C-MU hasn’t come close to beating
Pitt since. The last three games
ended in 5-1, 9-2 and 12-2 decisions
for the Panthers.

“We’ve never played rough with
those fellas,” Barcalow explained,
“but they’ve always played an
unethical type of game against us,
with the spitting and such.”

Pitt has run into problems with
spitters wearing other than Tartan
uniforms. Earlier this year, Miami
(Ohio) gentleman Tom Maletic
“expectorated,” as Barcalow said,
in the general direction of Pitts’s
Gary Fries.

Friday, December 9, l977—THE PITT NEWS—Page 13

Wind—Again?

“He just spit at Fries,” Barcalow
said at the time. “I oouldn’t believe
it. I don't know if that’s a disease
that came over from Camegie-Mel-
lon or what.”

Though the Panthers lost that
game to Miami," 6-5, they put up a
much» better battle than the night
before, when they lost to the same
team, 15-2.

So if spitting at the Panthers is
what it takes for Pitt to get
motivated, maybe a Tartan or two
will do Pitt a favor and do just that.
It just might start the Panthers on
their quest for that elusive .500
mark.

No Place Like Home for the Holidays

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer
Panther reserve linebacker Des-
mond Robinson has a special wish
for Christmas. So do Hugh Green,
Fred Jacobs, Laverga Walker,
Elliott Walker and Gary Silvestri.
They all want to be home for
Christmas. Of course, due to

"circumstances beyond their con-

trol, none of the Pitt football
players will get their wish. They’ll
be spending their holiday in
Jacksonville, Fla. where they'll
begin preparations Dec. 21 for their
Gator Bowl encounter with Clem-
son Dec. 30.

Although none of the Panthers
will be spending Christmas Day at
home, several have made plans to
get a little of the holiday feeling a
bit early.

Several are leaving Saturday
after practice (the last day of
practice at Pitt Stadium before
ﬁnals begin next week), while

‘(V-}‘3everal others will be going home

 

right after the Gator Bowl.

“I’ll be spending an early
Christmas with rpy family in
Atlanta,” Robinson said; “I’ll
have three or four days to spend
some time with my family because
I’ll be leaving when my finals are
over next week.”

Hugh Green, the freshman
standout from Natchez, Miss.
wants to go home, too, since he
hasn’t been home since June.

“Just as long as I’m home
sometime during the holiday
season,” Green said, “it doesn’t
really matter when I go home.”

Green plans to leave Saturday,
and will rejoin his teammates in
Jacksonville Dec. 21.

Laverga Walker is one Pitt player
trying to get home for Christmas
Day.

“It depends on the practice
schedule," Walker said. “If we
don't practice on the 24th or 25th,
I'm going to ask coach Sherrill if
he’ll let me go home for Christmas
Day. I’ll have to get clearance from
the coach first.”

Miami, Walker’s home town, is
about a ﬁve-hour drive from
Jacksonville.

Elliott. ‘ Walker, Laverga’s
younger brother, now recuperating
from a sprained ankle he suffered
in a pickup basketball game, also
plans to get home for the holidays.
Unlike his brother, he doesn’t plan
to be home for Christmas Day
itself.

“Of course, I want to be home
for the holidays,” Walker said.

Page l4—THE PITT NEWS—Friday, December 9, I977

Schubert Psyched for South

- The day Mark Schubert was interviewed
for this column, the wind chill factor in Pit-
tsburgh was about 20 below zero. In
Jacksonville, on the northern tip of the’
Florida Atlantic coast line, the temperature
was about 70 degrees. _

Jacksonville is the place where the Pan-

thers will meet Clemson in the Gator Bowl I

‘ Dec. 30.

 

 

It was only logical that Schubert, the Pan-
thers’ extra-point and short-yardage field
goal kicker from Springdale, Pa., be asked
whether the difference in weather will have
any effect on the way Pitt kicks the ball Dec.
30.

“It could,” Schubert said before practice
Wednesday, “if we were practicing longer at
Pitt Stadium. We’re only practicing here for

three more days, then we’re taking next week

off for finals. Right after that, we’ll be
heading down to Florida, so the cold won’t
affect us. I

“But if we were up here longer, it just
might have,” said Shubert. “It’s hard to get
your timing down practicing in the cold
weather. The timing just isn’t there between
the center, the holder and the kicker.

“What will make a difference,” Schubert

continued, “is the way the wind blows down

there, and the altitude. In Florida, or
anywhere in the South for that matter, you
have different altitudes than you do up here.

The wind blows straight out. Even when the

wind blows right into your face, it’s usually a
dry wind that’s not going to hurt your

distance at all. We’ll still be able to kick the '

ball.”
This difference in wind and altitude,

Schubert contends, is the reason there sup-
posedly are more good kickers in the South
than in the North. The flatlands, good wind
and good altitude just could be the reason
why kickers, like Oklahoma’s Uwe von
Schamann, Russ Erxleben of Texas and
Texas A&M’s Tony Franklin consistently
have been booting 50-yarders this year.
“Their altitude and wind direction helps"
them,” Schubert said. “The kickers in the
North have to contend with buildings and
hills; down South, they’re dealing with flat
land," where the altitude’s considerably bet-

- ter. The kickers in Texas; for example, are
' good, but they aren’t supermen like they’re

cracked up to be.”

Pointing to the Panthers’ game with
Florida earlier this season, Schubert said he
thinks the South brings out the best in Pitt
kickers, too.

“My gosh,” Schubert said, “Dave (Trout)
kicked one field goal into the stands, that’s
how good he was kicking that day. It was
unbelievable. The altitude certainly helped
us.
“It’s also easier to kick in the warm"
weather, because the football is so much sof-
ter,” Schubert continued. ‘‘In the cold
weather, it has a tendency to be harder. I
don’t know about the conference Clemson
plays in (Atlantic Coast Conference), but I
do know that some of the southern schools
play with used, bloated balls. Here, we use
new balls that have a tendency to be trim-
mer.

“Florida, for instance, played with used
balls. I know their whole conference does
(the Southeastern Conference), which makes

_ a difference too.”

The next logical question to ask
Schubert~—what’s the scouting report on
Clemson and its kicking game? ,

“Really, we don’t know too much about
it,” Schubert said. “But you have to figure
that, to get as far as they did, they had to
have a pretty good kicking game, or a good
return team or a good kick or punt return
coverage team. They had to have something
to do as well as they did.”

‘Question of Self-Confidence
Pitt's Bill Bailey Battling

-. '-:-

Rande Stottlemyer
Still Not Satisfied
Despite Record

By KAREN KADILAK

Pill News Stall” Writer‘

Pitt News Slaffwriler
In a ﬁnal 190-pound match at the
Penn State Invitational last week-
end, Pitt wrestler Bill Bailey,

behind 4-0 in the last minute of the

contest, fought his way out from
under Lehigh’s Brown for a
two-point escape, knocked the
Engineer to the mat for a two-point
takedown, and rode the fallen
wrestler the rest of the way for the
one-point "riding time advantage
and a 5-4 victory.

‘Not only did the Panther senior
earn his weight championship title,
but something he had been lacking
in previous good seasons as
well——conﬁdence. .
’ “Conﬁdence is what has helped
Bill the most, ’ ’ Pitt head coach Dave
Adams said. “In the past, he’s not
realized how really good he could
be. The tournament helped
him—-Brown plays the bottom, well,
and Bill had to beat him at his
best.”

“The first period I was very
cautious,” Bailey said. ”he (Brown)
put me on my back for four points
and it made me wonder just what I
could do. Last year, when we met
them during the regular season, he
pinned me. But the Penn State
crowd was behind me because they
didn't want him to win and have
Leigh take the team championship
away from Penn State. I could hear
them. I was able to beat him this
time‘.

“You’re thoughts can change

me out there from now on.”

From now on begins Friday night
when Pitt travels to Lycoming, and
Saturday afternoon when it visits
17th-tanked Bloomsburg, one of the
Panthers’ Eastern Wrestling Leag-
ue (EWL) rivals.

‘ ‘I think of Lycoming as the same
as Akron (which Pitt beat, 33-11),”
Bailey said. “While Bloomsburg is
a solid team, they have no
outstanding wrestlers, but all of
them are good.”

Adams, whose club is coming off
a ﬁfth-place ﬁnish against a good
crop of teams in the PSU
tournament, believes that his
squad, which out-distanced 10th
ranked Michigan and 11th-ranked
Syracuse at State College, could
break into the Top 20 with two
victories this week, despite having
no healthy heavyweight wrestlers
after injuries to starter Mark
Stepanovich and his replacement,
Mike Palko.

“We have to be careful,” Adams
stressed, “not to move a good
wrestler to another weight and
possibly deny him from contribut-
ing to the team the way he does in
his own weight class."

“I don’t know about Blooms-
burg’s heavyweight," Bailey said,
“but it doesn't matter tr. me—I’ll go

. where they need me. We have no

heavyweight now—-we have to
move someone. after Christmas,

everything will be back to normal.

Pitt’s Bill Bailey and Rande Stottlem yer.

Stepanovich and Palko will recover
from their injuries.”

And when they do, they may add
talent to what. could be a nationally-
ranked club that may challenge Pitt
basketball for student fans.

“A lot of people ask me, ‘What
weight division do you ﬁght in? We
don’t really ﬁght, but a lot of people
don’t realize that and think we
"wrestle like they do on Studio

1 Wrestling because they don’t see us

perform,” Bailey said. “But those
who do go tell me they would never
miss a match. For them, this will be
a good yer because we’re going to
do well—we won’t have to worry
about a .500 season like last year
(6-6). This year we could be in
contention with Penn State (EWL
team ranked 14th nationally) and
Clarion (EWL team ranked 20th:."

Listening to Pitt wrestler Rande
Stottlemyer, you’d think he lost
every one of his lightweight
matches during the Penn State

Invitational this past weekerigﬂ

instead of winning them all.

Stottlemyer, along with Panther F
light heavy weight Bill Bailey (190)
swept his individual weight class to
lead Pitt to a sixth-place showing in
the tournament. He was happy he
won, yet unhappy with the way he
won.

“I could have been more
aggressive,” Stottlemyer ex-
plained. “Technique-wise, I can
get a‘ lot better. Conﬁdence-wise, I
can do a lot better than I did this
weekend. I didn't wrestle well at/'

'all." 5

In the competition, which in-
cluded six teams r_ated in the top
twenty, Stottlemyer downed grap-
piers from Navy, Clarion State and
Michigan State to “win his weight
division.

“The first match, I felt all right
about. Stottlemyer said. “The
second match, I felt the same. The
third match, I didn't really want to
go out at all. but I did some running
before the match to get my
metabolism up. The running must
have helped, because I felt a lot

better during that match than I did-if 

during any of the others.

"In the first two matches,”
Stottlemyer continued,» “I was
lucky to get by. I won the first two

CINCINNATI-——For Cincinnati,
there’s none of the gnashing of
teeth and hand wringing this week
that normally occurs when the
Bangals prepare for the Pittsburgh
Steelers, their long-time national
Football League enemy.

Forget those six straight losses,
growls combative Bengal defensive
end Coy Bacon. He says the
“new” Cincinnati Bengals “have

decisions on riding time, both of
them by one point. It’s all right to
win on riding time—there’s an art
to it. It’s just a hard way to win.

“‘In the ﬁnals, I had a ﬁve-point
move that helped build up my point
total, and helped me get by more
points than what I did in the ﬁrst
two matches.”

Both Stottlemyer and Pitt wrestl-
ing coach Dave Adams dismissed

_ .the theory Stottlemyer, who has

practically unbeatalbe, even on off
nights.

“I’m far from where I want to
be,” Stottlemyer said. “I’d like to
think I can wrestle a lot better than
Idid over the weekend. It’s hard to
explain, but just because you win,

it doesn't mean you’re wrestling.

half-stepping on the mat, I would
feel pretty decent about it, but I
wasn’t doing either.”

Adams said he thinks Stottle-

gpyer has off nights because he is
0 ‘starting to peak for the Nationals in

March.

“The year-long layoff hurt him,”
Adams said in reference to the
medical redshirt Stottlemyer took
last year following knee surgery.

“His moves are not as sharp. His
timing’s not coming yet, and he
wasn’t as aggressive as he should
have been. Still, he showed me a
lot in that ﬁnal match. He wasn’t as
‘hesitant as he was in the earlier two
matches. Rande has a head on his
shoulders, so he’s thinking about
the Nationals. He knows there’s
bigger and better things ahead.”
Stottlemyer agreed with his

Nationals," the lightweight said.
“I would like to be undefeated
during the season, but if I lose, I'm
not going to be heartbroken. I’d
rather go undefeated during the
Nationals than during the regular
season.

“I guess I shouldn’t be so critical
of myself,“ Stottlemyer said. “It’s
just getting over that first step, I
guess. We have a tough weekend
coming up (Lycoming Friday and
‘gith ranked Bloomsburg Saturday;

 both matches on the road). If I

don’t get on the stick soon, I could
easily get beaten.”

“We know what we have to do to

“Fearsome Foursome.”

And what would that be? . H

“Contain Franco,” replied
Bacon.

He was referring to fullback
Franco Harris, who last week
topped the 1,000-yard mark for the
ﬁfth year in a row.

Bacon said Cincinnati must keep
the punishing running back to short
yardage gains. 4 .

“We did it last game. He didn’t
get loose,” said Bacon, pointing to
the earlier meeting in Pittsburgh.
The Steelers won 20-14, surviving a
blocked punt in the ﬁnal minutes
and a passing barrage by backup
quarterback John Reaves.

Cincinnati tries to cover such

drawbacks by throwing short

If the Bengals win by less than
six, they must then defeat Houston
next week in the regular season

Bacon, who joined the Bengals
last year, detects a ﬁerce, new
pride on a team which has not
defeated Pittsburgh in three years.

“You’re not talking to the same
team this year,” said the 270-
pound veteran who led the National

sacks last year.

“Last year when I ﬁrst came
