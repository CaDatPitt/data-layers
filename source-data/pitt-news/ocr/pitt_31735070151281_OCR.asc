  Federal
student
loan rates

is double

Danielle Fox -
Staﬂ Wrz‘ter

Lawmakers’ inaction will cost
students receiving federal loans
substantially over coming years.

On June 29, 2o12,.Congress
voted to extend the 3.4 percent
interest rate on subsidized Staf-
ford loans for an additional year,
preventing the rate from rising

to 6.8 percent as previously .

scheduled -after budget cuts
shrunk funding for the loans.
The rate was set to double on
July 1, 2013, unless Congress
took further action. The doubled
rate took effect on Monday.

The additional year was
meant to allow Congress time
to find a solution that beneﬁted
students without raising fed-
eral debt, but the year came and
went. On Friday, Congress ad-
journed for a one-week recess
without passing any legislation
to halt the increase. Although
the House of Representatives
approved a Republican-spon-
sored bill in May that was de-
signed to keep interest rates on
some federal loans competitive
with market rates, the Senate
did not approve the bill before
the recess.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele
said the University would not
speculate on whether the in-
crease in loan? rates could affect
admissions for the coming year.

Pitt community weighs in on chancellor's legacy

Mahita Gajanan & .
Gideon Bradshaw
The Pitt News Staﬁ’

Pitt Chancellor Mark A. Norden-
berg announced on Friday that
he intends to leave his current

position in the summer of next A

year, capping a 19-year career
highlighted by signiﬁcant prog-
ress at the University.

Stephen R. Tritch, chairman
of Pitt’s Board of Trustees, an-
nounced that the Board must
now begin the search for the
next chancellor during a Board

of Trustees meeting Friday
morning in Posvar Hall. ‘When
Nordenberg steps down in Au-
gust 2014, he will have served
19 years as chancellor, making
him one ‘of the longest-serving
top administrators at a major

American research university}

Faculty members and students

V will remember Nordenberg

fondly as a personable and dedi-
cated administrator.
' “My short-term goal is clear,”

A Nordenberg said in a University‘

press release. “I intend to work_
as hard as I can during my ﬁnal

year as chancellorto make cer-
tain that it is another great year
for Pitt.” V

Nordenberg, who said that
he intends to remain available
in Pittsburgh and at Pitt once
the next year has concluded,
went on to say that he expects to
teach and involve himself in pub-
lic service projects, but would
wait until he -had more time to
plan before he could announce
his specific intentions.‘

Pitt spokesman John Fedele ‘

said that Nordenberg, a tenured
law professor, would probably

teach in Pitt’s School of Law, but
said it’s unknown what speciﬁc
courses Nordenberg will teach.
Nordenberg said he is proud
of the contributions he has made
over thelast 18 years.
“Emotionally, it’s_ hard,” he
said at a press conference fol-
lowing the meeting Friday. “It’s
been my life, so it’s something
that is difficult to leave behind,
but I do feel it’s the right thing
[to retire], so I feel good in that

. sense.”

Health care programs might save federal funds with generic meds
Raechelle Landers
For The Pitt News

According to a new study con-
ducted by researchers at Pitt and
Dartmouth College, Medicare
missed an opportunity to save
more than $1 billion.

The researchers compared
the prescription drugs of pa-
tients with diabetes who were
being treated in the Department
of Veteran Affairs and in the
Medicare system and conclud-
ed that Medicare beneﬁciaries
with diabetes use two to three
times more brand-name drugs
than a comparable group in the
VA health care system, which
saved the latter $1.4 billion in
2008. But a policy attorney for
Medicare said that the agency
cannot adopt the VA’s practices
for prescribing medications.

Medicare is a federally fund-
ed health insurance program for

0

senior citizens and some Ameri-
cans with disabilities. The VA
is a federal government agency
that oversees benefits for U.S.
military veterans.

Walid Gellad, an assistant
professor in Pitt’s School of
Medicine and Graduate School
of Public Health, was the lead
author on the study, which was
published online June 11 and will
appear in the July 16 print edi-
tion of the journal “Annals of
Internal Medicine.” _

The study analyzed four

.medication groups commonly

used by patients with diabetes,
including oral hypoglycemics
and long-acting insulins,_ both
of which are used to treat diabe-
tes. The researchers calculated
the proportion of patients using
any brand-name drug of interest
on a national level in both the
Medicare Part D and VA systems.

The team of researchers fo-

cused on patients with diabetes

over the age of 65 because they
are more common, and there is a
wide variety of brand-name and
generic medications available
for treatment. Gellad said the
cost of these medications is also
expected to rise in coming years.

The patients withinlthe Medi-
care system were receiving pre-
scriptions through Medicare
Prescription Drug Coverage, or
Part D, a program that covers

N some Medicare recipients’ pre-
scription medications.

The researchers analyzedthe
systems’ respective formularies,
or the lists of drugs.prescribed,
and their report addressed
how the differences in these
prescription practices affect

, the rates of generic drug use.
While the VA has one national
formulary, Medicare contracts

with several different insurance ’

companies, each with a different
formulary. This meansthat the
VA has ‘more ability to manage

prescribing within its system,
Gellad said.

According to the report, the
main reason for the VA’s relative-
ly infrequent-use of brand-name
drugs is its ability to promote
“therapeutic substitution,” or
substituting generic drugs’ for
brand-name drugs that are in the
same class as, but not identical
to, the generic medication. This,

as well as other regional factors,

could have saved Medicare more
than $1 billion on certain diabe-
tes medications in 2008 alone.

The report addresses the po-
litlcal feasibility of changing leg-
islation to make Part D function
like the VA, saying that a legis-
lative change is not warranted
when there are other ways that
Medicare could leverage for
lower costs.

But where Gellad hopes to’
see changes in how Medicare
physicians prescribe, one at-
torney who advises people on

navigating the Medicare system
said that any structural change

in Medicare would in no way be .

expeditious. ~

“The systems are structured

very differently,” said David
Lipschutz, an attorney for the
Center for; Medicare Advocacy
since 2010: The Center for Medi-
care Advocacy is a national non-
proﬁtfnonpartisan organization

* based in Washington", D.C., and

Mansfield, Conn.

Lipschutz, who read Gellad’s
and his team’s report, said that
one system does not translate
directly into the other. But 'the
study accounted for this, accu-
rately comparing the two sys-
tems by compensating for dif-
ferences between them.

“The Part D program would .

probably have to be significantly
restructured to reach the same
levels of overall drug saving as

Nordenberg attributed his
greatest accomplishment as
chancellor to creating a culture
at the University that is char-
acterized by high ambition, a
commitment to the strength and
future of the institution and high
levels of respect.

Other notable accomplish-
ments during Nordenberg’s ten-
ure include Pitt moving into the
top five of all research universi-
ties in terms of federal science
and engineering research and
development support, students
and faculty receiving numerous
academic awards and the Uni-
versity’s endowment increasing
6.5 percent, from $463 million
in 1995 to $2.99 billion at the

end of last quarter.

, Nordenberg said dealing with
the bomb threats that plagued
Pitt in 2012 was among the big-
ger challenges during his time as
chancellor along with the issues
regarding state funding.

Paula Grabowski, a Pitt pro-
fessor and chair of the Depart-

Chancellor Nordenberg announced his plans to retire Friday morning. Pitt News File Photo

said.
Grabowski said that although

Nordenberg is a busy man whom
she does not see very frequently,

she has always been impressed

by how much he remembered
about her when they did speak,
including details about her re-
search and at which universities
Grabowski had been before com-
ing to Pitt.

pany, announced that Board

lor to name some qualities required of
a successor, saying that there was no
substitute for logging a lot of hours.
Further, Nordenberg said that the job of
chancellor would be satisfying only to a
person who feelsgood about contributing
to a process. that puts others in a better
position and can deal with a wide range
of constituent groups on a number of
important issues.

Student Government Board President
Gordon Louderback recalls the SGB in-
auguration injanuary 2012 —— right after
he was elected to SGB — as the earliest
instance he can recall talking to Norden-
berg. But even before that, the chancellor
was familiar to Louderback as a presence
at athletic events, the annual Pitt Make a
Difference Day, at the Freshmen Convoca-
tion and around campus.

Louderback said that he has found
Nordenberg receptive and personable
whenever he has dealt with him as an
SGB member and president.

“For the amount of work he does, he’s a
very visible chancellor,” Louderback said.

He went on to say that some of his
friends who attend other universities
can’t name their schools’ chancellors or
presidents. s

Louderback pointed out that since
Nordenberg took over as chancellor, ad-
missions applications have increased by
about three times to their present num-
bers. Louderback said he thought this
has raised the quality of applicants to
Pitt and improved academic life.

He said he wanted Nordenberg’s suc-
cessor to be someone as dedicated and

adept at dealing with conﬂict, pointing
to the way Nordenberg handled the 2012
bomb threats.

Both Louderback and Grabowski ada-

_, mantly said they-could'n’t think of any-

thing negative about Nordenberg.

Nor could professor of anthropology
Jeffrey Schwartz, who has been at Pitt
since 1974 and who called Nordenberg
the best chancellor he has worked un-
der at Pitt. He described his relationship
with Nordenberg as both professional
and personal. '

Schwartz said N ordenberg has main-
tained a trajectory of increasing the vis-
ibility of Pitt, including its branch cam-
puses.

He also thought Nordenberg has over-
come a “stagnant reputation” that outsid-
ers held for Pitt when_Norderberg became
chancellor.

‘Schwartz also said Nordenberg has
done an outstanding job with community
engagement.

At a time when many other universities

have drastically cut humanities programs-

or changed the focus of many programs to
favor hard sciences, Schwartz said, Nor-
denberg has maintained a broad range
of academic growth. He hopes the next
chancellor does the same.

“I think it would be short-sighted to
truncate the breadth of intellectual op-
portunity available at the University,”
Schwartz said.

Both Schwartz and Grabowski said
they were glad Nordenberg would stay
on as a faculty member. ,

“[Nordenberg] has done as much for
the University as anyone could,” Schwartz
said’. I l

the VA,” Lipschutz said.

Gellad said that the formularies of the
systems differ signiﬁcantly, but Medicare
could use generic medication more fre-
quently without changes in the legislation
that directs the program.

“There are ways to incorporate what
the VA is doing into the Medicare system
without completely changing Medicare,”
Gellad said in an email.

For instance, Medicare could offer new
incentives for physicians to prescribe
more competitively priced drugs when
possible.

The private Part D plans available in

Medicare compete with each other to en- ‘

roll members so it is beneficial for them
tomake more drugs available. Physicians
then have the ability to prescribe-generic
or brand-name drugs.

Lipschutz said that whether Medicare
physicians can achieve the same levels of
generics as the VA or not is “deﬁnitely
worth exploring.” -

“It’s a worthwhile cause to push for
generic drug use,” Lipschutz said.

The study was funded by grants from
the VA, National Institutes of Health and
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The
researchers said in their report that the
sources of funding had no role in the de-
sign, conduct or analysis of the study.

“I think shrugging off these results
simply because Medicare will never have a
national formulary is missing the point,”
Gellad said in an email. “Any individual
physician can easily change their own
prescribing to use more generics. You
can change nothing about the Medicare
system and achieve the same levels of
generics as the VA if physicians change
how they practice in Medicare.”

Gellad said that there are misconcep-
tions about the quality of generic drugs.
In his research, he and his team found
nothing to indicate that generic drugs
were more or less effective than their
brand-name counterparts. '

While the study focuses on an older
generation, Gellad said that anyone, in-
cluding college-aged patients, could save
money by avoiding brand-name medica-
tions whenever possible.

“The lesson is  ifyou’re given a pre-
scription for an expensive brand name, to
ask for a generic alternative,” Gellad said.

Fedele said in an email, speaking for the
University.

Federal legislators bemoaned Con-
gress’s inability to pass a bill preventing
the doubling of loan rates, though they
emphasized that it would not go into ef-

that Democratic lawmakers might at-
tempt to reverse or decrease the rise in
the rates of interest when Congress re-
sumes its session next week.

The students who received subsidized
Stafford loans received an average of
$3,385 in the 2013 ﬁscal year, according
to a Congressjoint Economic Committee
Democratic Staff issued last month. If a
student borrowed at that rate for four
years, he or she would borrow $13,540.
If the student paid the loan off over a
10-year span, he or she would pay a total
of $5,000 in interest at the new interest
rate of 6.8 -percent, more than twice the
$2,400 in interest he or she would have
paid at the rate of 3.4 percent.

According to the same report, a
student who received the maximum of
$23,000 in subsidized Stafford loans
would pay $8,600. in interest over 10
years at the new rate, compared to $4,100
at the previous rate.

Republicans in the House passed their
proposal on interest rates for federal
student loans, but Democrats were un-
successful.

On May 23,’ 2013, the Republicans in
the House approved the proposal, The
Smarter Solutions for Students Act,
which addresses the student loan in-
creases. s

Although the proposal is designed to
keep interest rates on federal student
loans from doubling, it caps the interest
rates on subsidized Stafford loans at 8.5
percent, even higher than the current 6.8
percent rate. 1

In a press release issued June 18,
about two weeks before the interest
rates increased,‘Speaker of the House
John Boehner, R-Ohio, accused fellow
Democratic lawmakers of playing politi-
cal‘ games instead of taking steps to help
students.

“It is stunning that Senate Democrats
would leave town having done nothing to
prevent interest rates on college loans
from doubling,” Boehner said in the state-
ment. “Earlier this year, the president
called for a market-based interest rate
for student loans. House Republicans
responded by passing one.” |

, High-—speed Internet providers:

Stephen Suss
Coglumnist

I "realize my apartment is
cramped and, knowing that a
Comcast representative was
coming over, I should have
considered moving some things _
around to make his job easier.
But still, islthere any excuse for
the cable guy, while searching
for my wire, to kick back and

scratch my new classical guitar‘ '

that I had saved up almost a year
for? ‘

What really vexed me, though,
was not so much the scuff on my
instrument, but that I wasn’t the
one to cause it,—.. that -was my
prerogative.,Comcast and other
cable and Internet providers
have left many people feeling
similarly cheated or with the
feeling that they have no idea
what they’re getting themselves
into, especially when it comes to
Internet speeds.

But this, of course, was only a
minor annoyance. My issue with
Comcast and other internet ser-‘
vice providers is a much more
complex one.

We all know that when you
buy a car you receive two mile-
age ratings: city and highway.
Although your car’s perfor-
mance will still vary depending
on how and where you drive,
most people find that their ve-
hicle will fall somewhere within
these reported ranges. However,
the accuracy of this rating has
little to do with the manufac-
turer’s honesty and more to do
with government regulation.

Fuel economy is tested in
laboratory conditions thatare
highly regulated by the EPA.
Although every car manufac-
tured isn’t tested, a representa-
tive model — based on class or
size — is required to be tested
against a standard condition.

In the world of broadband
providers, though, there is no
equivalent to this type of testing.

Although the Federal Com-
munications Commission com-
missioned SamKnows — a third-
party Internet speed tester —- in
2010 to run accurate tests of the
Internet speeds experienced by

‘ Americans, transparency in ad- .

vertisement of Internet speeds

untruthful at  speed

is something that really has yet

V to emerge.

Taking a glance at the FCC’s
website and its bar graphs, one
can observe that, at face value,
it appears that companies are
advertising the services they
provide accurately, with the
exception of AT&T and Wind-
stream, who only'provide about
90 percent of the peak speed
they advertise. Many providers
might even seem to advertise
conservative peak speeds, but
this overall picture doesn’t tell
the whole story.

‘ On graphs further down the
webpage it becomes apparent
that, across the board, most In-
ternet companies’ peak speeds
become accurate only when
they are advertising download
speeds 30 megabits per second
or more. This is an obvious at-
tempt to provide a little moti-
vation for people to “upgrade”
their speeds. DSL download
speeds, especially, only peak at
85 percent of maximum speeds
advertised. Essentially this is

Suss D

false advertising — no company should
be able to falsely represent its basic ser-
vices in order to get customers to pay
more.

From personal experience, I can tell
you my upgrade from “Comcast Basic”
to “Comcast Blast” was more like a puff
than a blast. I’ve been testing my Inter-
net speeds for a while now, and I was
supposed to go from a peak of 20 mps
of download to 50 mps. On average, my
jump has been more like a move from 18

mps to 20 mps —— on a good day. I am still ‘

hardly able to stream through my PS3,
and I haven’t bought any more devices

such as an Xbox, which use the Internet.

The FCC plans to conduct a test on
mobile broadband this year as well. The
results should be interesting, considering
how most mobile companies have altered
both how they provide and advertise data.

For example, with,Verizon announcing
last year that it is no longer providing
unlimited data plans, some companies,
such as AT&T and T—Mobile, portrayed
themselves as the last bastions of unlim-
ited data, neglecting to tell customers
that their data speeds would drop sig-
niﬁcantly after the customers reached
a certain amount of usage — a process
known as throttling. This might be all
well and good ifthe speeds were reduced
to where they didn’t,rend'er your phone’s

EdlI:orlalPollcles

Internet unusable.

AT&T had to eventually back away
from its plan because ofits lack of popu-
larity,’but then Verizon began to throttle
its unlimited data users as well. This oc-
curred after the company forced custom-
ers who already had unlimited data plans
to buy new phones at full price just to
“keep” this service, unlike most custom-
ers who pay a lower, subsidized price for
their phone with each new contract.

Free-market capitalism has its pitfalls,
and dishonesty is definitely one of them.
Technology is one field that is growing
far faster than government regulation
can catch up with.

It’s true that multiple factors affect In-
ternet speed, such as distance from your

ISP, number ofpeople using the connec-
tion, etc. But companies have the ability
to report and advertise a range or aver-
age speed, rather than promoting what
their present download speed “speeds
up to,” which is rarely ever attained and
frequently spurious. Additionally, cell
phone companies shouldn’t make cus-
tomers jump through so many hoops to
barely keep services they already have.

Regulations need to be placed on re-
porting data rates, and that’s the bottom
line. Dishonesty shouldn’t ever be ac-
cepted just to prevent government regu-
lation where it’s needed because, as we
see with car manufacturers, just a little
regulation never hurt. I

Run the Jewels

Run fhe Jewels
Grqde: B+

Sounds like: El—P and
Killer Mike wrote
0 Mortal Kombcit
soundtrack

‘On Run the jewels, hip—hop’s

most surprising superhero-style
duo comes out strong with 10

tracks of combative and ﬁercely ,

produced — but one—dimen-
sional — hip-hop.

Last year, El-P and Killer
Mike announced their return

E to relevance in hip-hop with

the release of two .of the year’s
best-received albums. After the
dissolution of his storied record

label, Deﬁnitive Jux, and nearly
ﬁve years of relative silence, El-
P’s Cancer 4 Cure was a brilliant
return to form.

The album demonstrated
El-P’s unrivaled penchant for
spinning mesmerizing, para-
noid tales that often bridge the
gap between hip-hop and sci-
ence ﬁction. At the same time,
his production work for Killer
Mike’s R.A.P. Music allowed the
Atlanta rapper to put together a
politically conscious, pugilistic

- album that separated him from
s the crowd of middling southern

rappers with whom he had be-
come synonymous. 9
The collaboration between
the two rappers is a strange one
to say the least: Ifthe combina-

tion of Kanye and Jay-Z on Watch _

the Throne was the hip-hop
equivalent of a Batman-Super-
man crossover, then Killer Mike
and El-Pjoining forces for Run
thejewels is more like Deadpool
and Cable. While jay and Ye will

always have more heft as indi-
vidual superstars, the El-P and
Killer Mike combo is something

V altogether different. It’s two dis-

tinctly stylized rappers creating
music with a style all its own.
That style, it turns out, is
futuristic, pugilistic and down-
right fun. Throughout the course
of the album’s 10 relentless
songs, Run thejewels announces
the duo’s presence as a force in
hip-hop with all the affability
of a drunken haymaker to the

jaw. The album explodes from_

track one, spewing hostility in
all directions on some of the
most threatening dystopian
beats El-P has ever concocted.
As El—P quips on the ﬁrst verse,
“These motherf*ckers are all
thorn no rose.”

Despite the album’s outward
brutality, it’s hard to shake the
feeling that the duo had a hell of
a time writing it. Each song pro-
duces more and more ingenious
descriptions of inﬂicting bodily

go for the throat on Run the ]eWeIs

harm, ranging from Killer Mike
“taking grip pliers to the top of

your teeth” on “Banana Clipper,” ’

to El—P warning that “[he] and
Mike’ll go Twin Hype and do a
dance on your windpipe” on the
track “Twin Hype Back.” The al-
bum takes the battle track men-
tality and pushes it to borderline_
comic-book limits. The artists
crafted lines such as these for
maximum impact, forcing listen-
ers toisit and shake their heads
in awe.

The fun the two had on the
album is perhaps best evidenced
by the previously quoted “Twin
Hype Back,” in which they re-
cruit renowned D] and produc-
er Prince Paul to perform his
weirdest impression ofa smooth
seducer as “Chess Rockwell,”
crooning creepy lines such as,
“we can go over to Long John

Taking a
ride on the

John Lavanga
AC°J’E Editor

Every day-to—day bicyclist knows
that choosing a comfortable,
bike-friendly outﬁt is imperative
to enjoying an eveningjoy ride.

The ideal look combines prac-
ticality with style —- something
that will turn heads ‘without
slowing you down.

I ignored this bit of conven-
tional wisdom last Thursday eve-
ning and opted for nothing more
than my favorite pair of red and
blue gingham boxers.

Boxer briefs would have un-
doubtedly been more pragmatic,
but it’s not every day that one re-
ceives the opportunity to attend
an event such -as the Pittsburgh
Underwear Bike Ride.

I ﬁrst heard rumblings of
the event several weeks ago,
when a friend mentioned that
he planned to spend an upcom-
ing evening in nothing but his
skivvies and invited me along
for the ride. I

Naturally, I was all in.

I’ve had something of an aver-
sion to pants my entire life and
try to take advantage of any op-
portunity to be rid ofthe restric-
tive garment, much to the cha-
grin of some of my roommates.

I circled the date on my calen-
dar and counted down the days
until we would finally attain
liberation from the oppressive
force of our daily vestments,
praying that my freedom would
only arrive sooner.

After painful weeks of con-
tinuing to ride my bicycle fully
clothed, the day arrived, but
things didn’t go quite as planned.

After a mix-up and a last—min-
ute bicycle breakdown, I made
the trek to the event’s starting
point at 46th and Butler.

mate’s barely passable purple
bicycle, each pothole and road

Brad Pitt’s performance ancho

Though his performance was a bit muted at times, Pitt‘ once again came through in the slightly generic ‘World War Z’. MCT Campus

Brett Murphy
Stcyj" Fﬁiter

“World War Z”
Starring: Brad Pitt,
Mireille Enos

Directed by: Marc Forster
Grade: B- ’

Since Hollywood has, all but decided
that mankind will face any of a seem-
ingly endless reservoir of apocalyptic
scenarios, it’s interesting to see the actual
lengths our doomed species would go to
in order to “solve the problem” rather
than just survive. “World War Z” follows
humanity’s last-ditch efforts to find the
origins of and, subsequently, the cure

‘to a worldwide pandemic that has killed

billions.

At times bogged down by plot prob-
lems, “World War Z"’ ultimately claws its
way back to being the summer thriller
audiences expect, mostly by riding on
the back of Brad Pitt and rapid, though
at times overwhelming, CGI work. _

Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a United Nations
ofﬁcial turned stay-at-home dad. The
movie wastes no time in establishing what
is “normal” for theanchor characters, as
they’re immediately tossed into survival
mode when a swarm of zombies chases

them out of Philadelphia in an explosive .

opening sequence.’ It takes a while for
anyone to say the “z—word” but, come
on, people are sprinting around eating
each other. v

As opposed to many zombie thrillers
thatfocus on_an averagejoe who fell into
survival by happenstance, WWZ assumes
an angle that focuses on a much more

privileged citizen. If Lane didn’t have‘

high-ranking connections, he and his

rs mediocre ‘World War Z’

family would’ve suffered the same fate
as the-billions of casualties who fell dur-

ing the first few days of ‘the undeﬁned '

outbreak. From the onset, the movie up-
holds an elitist air about it, and it’s hard
to imagine that most of us‘wouldn’t die
within the first 10 minutes. Still, it’s easy
to shake thatinitial feeling of class—based
extinction — and ﬂeeting moment of

career evaluation — and trudge ahead»

With WWZ.

Once safely on board an aircraft car-
rier serving as the headquarters for the
militarized resistance, Lane secures his
position of importance despite an at-

me with butter all on my neck.”
Who exactly are the targets of El-P

and Killer Mike’s barrage of threats and ‘

insults? From the album’s title and lines
such as, “I stand on top oftowers like Ei-
ffel/ I rifle down all your idols/ Ni**as will
perish in Paris,” it’s fairly clear that hip-
hop’s more conventional superstars are
in their sights. It’s a shame that El—P and
Killer Mike would bother taking shots like
this because to compare Run the Jewels

to Watch the Throne does neither album
justice. Both are successful exercises in
braggadocio, but hip—hop’s audience and
style has become so varied that any com-
parisons between the two albums won’t
hold up particularly well. I
The album’s tunnel vision, however
cleverly packaged, does limit its scope.
Unlike the duo’s 2012 releases, Run the
Jewels lacks any sort of dynamic narra-
tive. The last track, “A Christmas F*cking
Miracle” has a storytelling element to it,
but, ultimately, this is a free collection of
hostile and well-executed battle tracks.
Though this hardly ruins the album -

in some ways, a narrative might have
been worse for an album such as this -
it certainly dampers its impact. Instead
of maintaining the deep resonation of
a nuanced and complex album, Run the
Jewels sounds more like a collection of
kick—ass bonus tracks.

In a sense, though, it is a collection of
kick—ass bonus tracks. After a fantastic
2012, El—P and Killer Mike decided to
release Run the Jewels for free as a thank
you to their fan bases and an announce-
ment of their presence in rap. To that
end, the album is a smashing success and
certainly exceeds conventional expecta-

- tions for what a free album should be.

It’s rare to see two established rappers
put this sort of time and effort into an

album that won’t earn them a dime, and p

for that reason alone, Run the Jewels is
something of a marvel.

El—P and Killer Mike will certainly
leave their mark on this era of hip—hop.
Ultimately, though, Run the Jewels is like
a good summer action ﬁlm: lots of ex-
plosions, gratuitous violence_and clever
lines, but lacking the sort of depth that
would make it memorable. I

bump jarring my entire body and giving
me a painful reminder that I was com-
pletely bereft of the protection an ex-
tra layer of pants provides. Suffice it to
say that a typical road bike seat, which
consists oflittle more than unforgiving
metal and the bare minimum of cushion-
ing, was not designed for joy rides in a
l0ose—ﬁtting pair of boxers.

Once I reached the starting line, my
mood began to brighten.

I saw a small constituent of men and
women —— most of them in their 20s
and 305, though the ages varied a bit
from that ,—’— milling about in all sorts
of There were boxers, bras,

 ‘colinp‘rés7sion'.,shorts, boxer A 
briefs and a man named Chris wearing a 

pair o_f black shorts, though he seemed
to be planning something. I

While we waited for the 9 p.m. start
time, Virginia McGrath, the organizer of
the event, ﬁlled me in on what exactly I
was getting into.

“I’m originally from Milwaukee, Wis.,
and one of my friends organized an un-
derwear bike ride there,” McGrath ex-
plained. “When Imoved to Pittsburgh,
I didn’t know a single person here, I
had never been to the city before, and
I figured I couldn’t go an entire summer
without riding my bike in my underwear.”

Thus, the Pittsburgh event was found-
ed last year. Though the basic premise of
the event is to “promote positive self-
body image,” it’s ultimately about meet-
ing people and making new friends.

The event occurs on the last Thursday
of “every month we can bear to ride,” said
underwear bike ride veteran Casey West,
who was on his fourth ride.

West also put to rest my concerns of .

tempt by the same officials who saved him
to deem his family “nonessential person-
nel” if he doesn’t agree to try and save
the world. He cooperates, thus, quickly
becoming “essential.”

The inherent problem with this bar-
gain is that Lane suffers no real loss, and
his globaljourney in search ofa cure —
which he will apparently discover if he
locates the epidemic’s origin — feels low-
stakes. His family is safe, which is all any
normal father and husband would care
about, and at times, Lane looks detached
from the moment, with the audience ex-

periencing a similar distance.

Nonetheless, he wraps a shawl around
his neck — pulling off the look as only
Pitt can —— and says goodbye to his wife,
Karin (Mireille Enos). As in many other
moments throughout the movie, the two
express, in their quick embrace, what
could be construed as shock, feigned col-
lectiveness for their kids’ and each other’s
sake, or simply confidence in their ability
to survive. Either way, more than once in
WWZ, Pitt looks a bit too confident and
Enos a bit too placid.

The movie succeeds with a zombie
epic’s usual grit. Lane survives everything
and anything thrown at him. At times,
in fact, it seems that he puts himself in

harm’s way after a lapse in judgment
that he ultimately overcomes with one
self—sacriﬁcial act after another. They’re

'absent—minded mistakes the averagejoe

would make, but probably not the astute,
miraculously vigilant Gerry Lane. You’ll
shake your head, twist your hand upward
and wonder, “Why would he go in there?”
Still, Pitt plays the lead with enough
poise and urgency to make for a compel-
linglhero, mostly because he appears to be
the only one on the ground trying to solve
the issue —— perhaps a nod to the United
Nations’ efforts worldwide, even at times
without a pending zombie apocalypse.
What WWZ doesn’t have is the zombie

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Several Pitt basketball players partici-
pated in the third evening of the Pitts-
burgh Basketball’ Club Pro—Am held at
the Greentree Sportsplex, and Panther

fans once again saw the formative stages '

of the 2013-2014 squad, as some of the
Panthers’ incoming freshman put on
impressive scoring performances and
showedimprovement from the first week
of league play. .

SPK Law 96, Oliverio’s Peppers 79

SPK Law, led by Lamar Patterson, Mike
Young and Mike Lecak, delivered a blow-
out win over Oliverio’s Peppers to start
the evening. SPK held a 56-32 lead after
one half and led by 20 points or more for
the majority of the second half.

SPK started the game with Patterson
keying two separate 8-0 runs, which put
his team up 16-5 early in the game. Pat-
terson knocked down a pair of triples and
assisted on a few other baskets, including
a dish to Lecak in the corner on a break
that forced a timeout from Oliverio’s.

Patterson was the star of the first
game, as he put up 21 points on 8-for-16
shooting to go with 10 rebounds and four
assists. Although his individual perfor-
mance demands merit in its own right,
Pattelrsonfs play holds more valuefor his
teammates, Lecak and Young.

‘_‘I kind of consider myself still new
because last year I redshirted. So that’s
why I like playing with Lamar because I
do learn a lot every game,” Lecak said.
“Especially with Mike [Young], a big-
name recruit coming in and everybody’s
expecting a_ lot, that’s the best person
to look toward, that’s a great person’ to
play with. I‘ enjoy it, and I know Mike
does too.” ' .

Young also contributed to his_team’s
victory, notching 14 points on 4-for—13

A shooting, but also pulling in seven re-

bounds.
“Played a good game, missed some

i« shots. I probably could’ve got a" couple

more foul calls,” Young said. “When I
come out here, I try to work on my motor,
get a lot of rebounds, and that’s about it.”

Young played alongside Patterson and
benefited from the reclshirt senior feed-
ing him multiple times.

“As a team, we’re split up, so we’re
talking about it’s me and L.P. on my team,
so we try to get some pick and rolls in.
He tries to work on some things, I try to
work on some things,” Young said.

PAT’S —:f'lEiI’NSE

Nostalgia generates unrealistic expectations for James

Patrick McAteer
Editor 2'72 C/lief

Sometimes you have to wonder
if nostalgia is_a dangerous con-
cept.

Two weeks ago, LeBron_Iames
and the Miami Heat took home
their second NBA championship
in a row, beating the San Antonio
Spurs in a classic seven—game
series that piqued the interest of
even casual NBA fans. Undoubt-
edly, this widespread interest
was fueled by the multitude of
storylines. A

Could James cement his sta-
tus as the world’s best player?
Could Tim Duncan, Manu Gino-
bili and Tony Parker bring home
what was foreseeably their ﬁnal
championship as teammates?
Are the Heat a so—called sports
dynasty? I

All of these questions were
answered, and yet, much of what
you hear from those aged 18 to
22 is that James and his Heat
teammates can’t hold a candle
to the Chicago Bulls of the 1990s
and their leader, Michaeljordan,
an icon of the era.

Yes, icon is the only way to
describe Jordan at this junc-
ture in history, and, clearly, he
deserves this status. Jordan’s
legendary status transcended

sports, and calling him a cul-
tural phenomenon is almost an
understatement. Although it’s
often cliche to say,]ordan was a
brand. Whatever he marketed ——
whether it was Gatorade, Wheat-
ies or Big Macs — it sold.

But it’s this iconic status

that has made it almost unfair.

to compare any modern athlete
to Jordan.

Think about it: Sports in
the United States are no longer
simply a pastime, but a 24-hour-
a—day, seven—day-a—week busi-

.ness. ‘Although it existed dur-

ing ]ordan’s peak years, ESPN
had yet to monopolize sports
broadcasting.

Now the network, which is
owned by Disney’s broadcasting
conglomerate, has the ability
to set the agenda in the world
of sports as well as provide a
frame through which viewers
may think about sports.

Take, for instance, Brett
Favre’s indecision regarding
whether or not to end his re-
tirement and return to the NFL

- in 2009. Under most circum-

stances, this would have been a
relatively uncontroversial deci-
sion. Favre was a future NFL Hall
of Famer and beloved ﬁgure in

Pitt to retire Fitzgerald’s jersey at home opener  

Patrick McAteer
Editor in Chief

The Pitt football team an-
nounced that they’ll retire for-
mer Panther and current Ari-
zona Cardinal Larry Fitzgerald’s
jersey Monday evening during a
ceremony celebrating Pitt’s en-
trance into the Atlantic Coast
Conference at Stage AE,on the
North Shore.

The jersey will be retired dur-
ing Pitt’s game against Florid
State on September 1 at Heinz
Field. .

Fitzgerald, who played wide
receiver at Pitt during the 2002
and 2003 seasons and worejer-
sey No. 1, is widely regarded as
the top receiver in the football
program’s history, winning the
Biletnikoff Award, given to the

nation’s top wide receiver during

the 2003 season. - .

The announcement, which
came as a surprise to Fitzgerald,
places him in a small group of
legendary Pitt student-athletes.
Other former players whose
jerseys retired include quar-
terback Dan-Marino, tight end
Mike Ditka, running back Tony
Dorsett, offensive lineman Bill

Fralic, running back Marshall

Goldberg, defensive end Hugh
Green, offensive lineman Mark
May and linebackerjoe Schmidt.

Pitt’s retirement of Fitzger-
ald’sjersey is yet another accom-
plishment for a player who has
achieved success at both the col-
legiate and professional levels.

In the.2003 season, Fitzger-
ald was considered college foot-
ball’s best receiver, compiling
92 catches for 1,672 yards and

22 touchdowns.

His NFL career with the Car-
dinals has been characterized by
similar success, with Fitzgerald
almost immediately asserting
himself as one of the league’s
top receivers. Last season, he

became the youngest player in‘

NFL history to record 700 catch-
es, joining Randy Moss as one
of only two receivers to record
10,000 receiving yards before
age 30. _

4 Steve Pederson, Pitt’s athletic
director, lauded Fitzgerald’s ac-
complishments during the cer-
emony, calling Fitzgerald one
ofthe best to°ever play the wide
receiver position.

“Larry Fitzgerald is the great-
est receiver in Pitt history and is
well on his way to future Hall of
Fame enshrinement in Canton,
[0hio],” Pedersori said. .

PAT’S TENSE

the eyes of Green Bay Packers fans who
had conducted himself with class and
dignity on and off the field throughout
his career.

But as soon as the events began to
unfold, ESPN’s talking heads started to
criticize Favre for‘ his indecision and
what they considered to be selﬁshness
or, in other words, his holding the Pack-
ers hostage.

It’s no different with James. The net-
work has transformed him into a polar-

izing figure by providing him with allies ~

such as Stephen A. Smith and enemies

am

July 3, 2018 i The Pitt News I vx/v\A/vpitthevvscom

such as Skip Bayless, and they and the
network’s other personalities usejordan
as the main figure of comparison.
WhenJames has a great game, his play
is considered Jordan—esque rather than
simply astounding because of the prec-
edent he has set for himself. Conversely,
when he plays poorly, especially in‘ the

_ ﬁnal minutes of a game, the naysayers

claim thatJordan would have always per-
formed well during crunch time.

Because ESPN has framedJordan’s ca-
reer as the measuring stick for all suc-
cessful NBA players, fans judge similarly.
And this framing has given Jordan and
his Chicago Bulls teams an almost god-
like status.

For example, James has received his
fair share of criticism for joining Dwyane
Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami rather
than remaining with the Cleveland Cava-
liers. The fans who criticizejames for that
decision sayjordan won championships
by himself and didn’t need the help of
other superstars.

I guess that’s true if you don’t con-
sider Scottie Pippen a superstar. Pip-
pen, an NBA Hall of Famer and one of
the league’s top 50 players of all time,
was right alongsidejordan during all six
of the championships their team won; In
fact, Jordan didn’t win a championship
until four years after Pippen joined the
Bulls. V

This isn’t to say that Jordan isn’t still
the greatest of all time, as he clearly still
is. His championships and scoring titles
speak for themselves.

But allow James and his teammates
to carve out their ownlegacy..It’s what’s
best for the future of professional sports.
