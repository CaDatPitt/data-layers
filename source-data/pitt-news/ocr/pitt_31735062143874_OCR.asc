case of “Pitt versus Pit.t”,- Jock be-
ing opposed-to. his old‘ time pal, Herb‘
Mccracken, new coach at Lafayette
College. The game presents some .un-
usual features other than the “Jock
versus Herm” end of it. » Jock, is send-

utation sufficient to attract the ‘atten-

when they ‘were looking for a‘ _suc-
cessor to Glen Warner. ~Sut'herl‘and
had unusual success at Lafayette, get-
ting an even break in the gamesjwitli
the Panthers, and also trouncing La-
-faMyette’s old rivals,-’Lehig_h, ﬁve““’suc-
cessive years. . __ f ;
Herb Mccracken, old -Sewickley as-
sociate of Jock Sutherland. andpal of
his‘-beforethey‘ even entered Pitt’,
won, fame as .a c_oach at"A11egheny
College and wasrecommended to La-
fayette by the Pitt‘ authorities when
Jock came here. M‘.Despit,e "all this,
friendship will be forgotten ‘Satnrclay
until after the game. It will be a bat-.
tle to ‘death between the Sutherland
Panthers [and Herb’—s Eastonians. La-
fayetteis now looked on.as a time
honored rival of Pitt in football, and
the annual games -also, bringout high’
class football. Last year Lafayette
adopted the‘ one year.'residence..rule
and is playing no freshmen, thereby
making the game an" equal one as re-
gards eligibility restrictions. "
ManMy’Alumni Out. M
Lafayett-e.-— alumni are very s'tron_g in
’Western Pennsylvania and hundreds
‘of them will be out to the game-Sat
urday-. It‘ is very likely that the La;
fayette band will be here with the
team to ﬁght with the Pitt band. The
Lafayette rooters will be, stationed in-
the 1 left wing or the‘ stands. .
. Pitt alumni orders for the Lafayette
game have been very heavy,‘ and at
large crowd is expected for the game.‘
Tickets ‘were mailed outfearly. this
week to all who ordered, and the pub-
lic sale is now in progress. Alumni
desiring -additional tickets can get
them at the public agéncies","Spald-

of Directors,’ class agents and a rec-
ord ‘of the contributions by classes
and by individuals. It also included

by-laws as of Ju1y_1_, 1923, including
{the provisions of-tMhe:Alumni Giving

The report showed that during the
first year of the‘Fund’s existence the

Camp Hamilton, VVindber, Where
the football team trained was, as
usual, the Mecca of alumni during the
early part of -September. Sunday was
always ,a‘ popular day for visitors, and
on- the second Sunday there‘ were no
less than 25 automobile loads of peo-
ple, who paid their respects to the
camp, many of these coming from
'Pitts‘bu1*gl1. A good “feed” was pro-
vided for everyone who came up.
Chancellor John G. Bowman,‘ accom-
panied by‘ Dean Manley and several
members of the University Faculty
were among the visitors.

Camp Hamiltonis one of the beauty
spots of the mountains around Wind-
ber and Johnstown and is ideally sit-
uated for football training purposes‘
Improvements have been added from
year to year until it is now well nigh
perfect from a. standpoint of football
conditioning. This was emphasize-d
during the past training season ‘when
som’e- rather disagreeable weather was
encountered and the nights were very
cold. Notwithstanding-_ these incon-
veniences, the squad was able to get
in‘ excellent condition and none of
the boys Msuﬂered on account of.being
out in the open.

Assisting Coach Jock Suth-erland at
camp‘*‘were “Cl1alky”_VVil1iam~son and
Floyd ‘Rose.-"The latter makes it a
point to spend his vacationat camp
"each ‘year when he can render» this

give the beneﬁts of‘ his man
experience in football. .

The Johnstown Pitt Club ' had Athe
football ‘coaching and managerial
staff as their honor guests ata dinner
:at the Ft. -Stanwix. Hotel’ one evening
during the training season.‘ ,About 75
attended the dinner and everyone had
something to say from ‘Head Coach

enormous, and every little deviation  _

Panther Eleven  Victory on

 ‘Fashioned Football-—Players’ Bitter Spirit Results in
;_  of Two Forislugging ‘

 7 By WILLIAM s.LAM1=E  

 The University of Pittsburgh‘ football team, playing its gﬁrst

A game under Jock Sutherland, proved itself a green outﬁt at Grove
City. Saturday by defeating Grove City College 14-0, witha pair of

.",tfou_chdowns.made in the ﬁrst and second quarters by consistent
"iackﬁe1d_1ine.plunges., There Was no Jakie Bohren to pull off sen-,
 sational dashes around the ends there was no Hoot Flanagan to cut

viciously ‘through the line, but Brown, Harding and Gustafson, 1923
substitutes, directed by Quarterback Amann,,last year’s Freslinian,
'.”haxs,1rea. at the Crimson line and acted as though they were used to it.

From the start until the ﬁnish, Pitt-5

shaped, up as the better team, the
Grovers plainly failing with a consist-

C‘ ent forward passing attack‘-and never.

di~ivin‘g closer than 25 yards to the
Pittsburgh goal. In the ﬁnal period

nderson blew a. placement. kick from '

tlieguarter way mark, but in the first,
thiﬁlosers only, fought
“the second to. the 33, and in the

V iiid

eiiter of the ﬁeld. The threa.tened
ﬁeld-f.‘go,a1,was only a’ shadow of the

Crimson 1923 feat of crossing thei“

Panther goal.

 Grove _City Far Outgained.
--The Gold and Blue outgained the
Grovers in yardage by piling- up 13

Aﬁrst, downs to six. Althougli Pitt
‘claims a ‘better record! for the aerial
game; neither eleven seems to have

it-_.jwell in hand, as Grove City’coIn- _

eted four and muffed 17 out of 23.

It  hi-lei. Pitt completed ,,four and dropped
three-tout of eight. On the other hand, 2
Pitt ;interce-pted two and Grove Cit?’

-_‘P‘ittsburgh’s. ﬁrst tally‘ came in the
in-gddl-e _ of the opening period,
nine‘1p1"ays after Grove City had
iailediat the ﬁrst of its two attempts
’-atzplacement. An exchange of punts

gave’,-the Pitt backs the ball on their

wn_44 yard line, when Jack Harding,
.lei’.t'fha1f, brought back memories of
‘ leis, by crashing through the C-rim.-
-_§'oi1,.cent_'ei', squirming past the secon-
dary defense, and dashing 56 yards for
chdown. Marsh Johnson, leading
the way through the ‘line, cut down

By WILLIAM s. LAMPE

S i_ LOCAL FOOTBALL authority, looking over the University of

. ' Pittsburgh~’s layout at Camp ‘Hamilton, punched a typewriter

. » long enough to inform an —a.nx;icus public that this year's situa-
tion ﬁnds Jock Sutherland, anew coach in an old school, with a. large
crowd of budding sattelites, but he forgot to keep» going until he
mentioned that’ the‘ entire squad, ‘with the exception of only three of
the 1923 real regulars, is‘ unusually green for this school. No one

can do justice to the taskconfronting Sutherland he is going to »

paint prospects so rosy that even the student backers might forget
the departure of"Nick Shuler, Hoot Flanagan, J akie Bohren and Nick
Golonna, who with Red Byers,’ leave ﬁve gaps in afour-position back-_
ﬁeld. . From theline, W_arner’s last, Captain J ordan,‘ Red Seidelson
and Templeton, all three ﬁghting -demons in the W. 85 J. and State
games last‘ year, graduate and lea.ve“Horse Chase, Zeke Wissinger
and Marsh Johnson as the centerfoundation for this year's machine.

In the backﬁeld, Jess Brown, Spike Harding and Andy Gustaf-
son, all regular subs‘ under-‘Pop, are holding‘ down three’ of the posi~.
tions; Of course, there -are the rising candidates from the Freshman
eleven, Donovan, Reister, Amann, Joe Schmidt, Tiny Linn, Mills‘,
Joe Archibald, Da-ve v Archibald, Vislay, McMillan, Clarence Ash-
baugh, Coulter, Harrington, Hank Schmidt, Meyers and Ollie Harris

- going into their ﬁrstvvarsity years." i

. Some oﬂicial connected with the,Pittsburgh team mentionedithe
football situation, but one authority '>n Western Pennsylvania brand-
ed it pessimistic propaganda. During the late Warner regime, when

Pitt had the team that could‘ have conquered Rome, Pop wouldn’t,
-se‘a.son’s opening, that he had a real player on the’

admit, at the
squad. ’

_ PANTHER AND THE CRlMSON
As the Pitt Panther lined up to face Charley Bo_wser’s Crim-
son at Grove City last-Saturday. two of last year's Freshmen
found their ways into the fray. Tuffy McMillan, a Wilkinsburg
High School sensation two Years ago, took Lloyd Jordan’s place
a.t~le~ft end, while Amann, a Bellefonte Academy product, worked
on the quarterback’sposition. From the outset, Amann. threw
play after play at the center of the 'Grove'rs’ line, not fruitlessly,
though, because Brown, Harding and Gustafson,"\vorking their
first game as a combination, ripped.h_oles as big as a roll top
desk. - . . '
Both of the Pitt touchdowns, coming in the first and second
quarters, on straight plug-down-the-‘ﬁeld football, came from a
man, Harding in one case with a mad 56-yard dash and Gustafson
with. a single yard lunge, crashing the Crimson primary defense.
Stories from the press box criticize the ‘quarter for allowing
‘ his mind to run in the same channel for the whole game, but
heearns the credit of tallying both scores “in the same channel.’’,
He took no dangerous risks, but when victory favored he. called
for -more diversiﬁed attacks which didn’t get big gains. Such _a
condition may be laid to the early season a.nd the inexperience
of the team as a whole. ' . ‘ ‘ "
‘By cracking the Grove City line so consistently. the Panther-
proved he is strong. The side-line spectator "could fairly. see the
power in the drive of the backﬁeld and in the crunching backs of p
the linesmen. The test that’Char1ey‘Bowser gave the first
Sutherlanders brought to light the strict training and condition-
ing in the weeks at Winber. At the win'd-up, the'players were
_ still in excellent physical shape instead‘ of. presenting the ap«»
'‘pearance- of the worn-out cigarette ﬁend who has tried to give
his best to his Alma Mater. Where Warner contented himself
with issuing orders, verbal instructions, Sutherland hit his own _
' = line and-fought his own backs, -physical instruction.
,_ . , WEST _VlRGl_NlA _ - ’
Last‘ ‘Saturday at Morgantown, West Virginia University took on West
Virginia Wesleyan to ded‘ic”ate ‘the Mountaineers’ new stadium. Tubby
Spears’ outfit won the verdict, 21- to 6,‘of course, with its crack lot of
stars; Nardacci, the back who tormented Pitt last- year at Forbes Field, -and

Armin, Mahrt, the kicker whose placement defeated the Panther the--year .

befor.e,~ both droppedjoff the squad a- weekago, but a horde of ,oth‘ers"‘re-
main to take their places. ~ _ U

_ Pitt this year. gets three of the
best young lawn tennis players
in. Western Pennsylvama. Two
of them are" the famous O’Laugh-
lin boys of Johnstown-—Davy and
',John. Davy Vvas the boys’ net
champion of the United States in
1922,. and has entered the school
of medicine at Pitt. His brother,
John, also ‘a coming racquet star,
has entered'the dental school,
both lads coming from Wes.tmo_nt
High school, Johnstown. ‘They
have taken part in numerous ten-
nis tourneys hereabouts in the
past year or "two, and are well
known in this city.

Another tennis star who is en-
tering Pitt this fall, is Byron
Bauer, who." comes from Eric
High. Helis the junior cham-
pion of Western Pennsylvania
and one of the youthful stars of
the state. ,

These lads; will, all be eligible
for the Pitt Freshman net team
next spring, and will give the
Panther yearlings a team th"at
will be mighty hard to beat.

that it can be double-decked when de-
sired,'giving -an additional capacity

team for over-"30 years, having played
at old Exposition Park, Allegheny,
