Orders Effective July 23

Captain Donald C. Tredennick, as-
sistant professor of Military Science

visit before taking up his new duties.

“As a younger officer of the staff,”
Captain Tredennick commented Fri-
day, “my stay at Pitt has been both
interesting and exciting-—and will be
a long-remembered one." He implied
that he would miss the social contacts
afforded by the University, but that
his new commission would mean an
advancement in his career as an of-
ﬁcer.

ﬁcers’ training schools at Fortess Mon-
roe, Va., in 1923-24 and in 1929-30'.

As drillmaster for the 120-piece
ROTC band, Cptain Tredennick has
done and outstanding piece of Work,
as recorded by the success of the man-
uevers at the Fordham game last an-
tumn when the crowd waited after the
game to watch it perform.

One of the ROTC men in the band
characterized him with a brief: “He's
one of us; we enjoyed working with
him.”

Captain Tredennick is also faculty
adviser of Pitt Riﬂes and of Phi Delta
Theta.

He holds membership in Scabbard
Blade, honorary military society;
Druids, sophomore honorary; Kappa
Alpha Phi, commerce fraternity; and
Phi Delta Phi, social fraternity. He
is a native of Youngstown, Ohio, and
now claims Johnstown as his home
town.

Annual YMCA Report
Reveals Year’s Data

Organization Experiences Increased
Membership Despite Moving

Exactly 34,215 students attended the
603 YMCA sponsored meetings on the
University campus during the past
year, according to the organization's
annual report submitted at the recent
installation service of the group's of-
ﬂcers. It was also estimated that ap-
proximately 10,000 more people were
reached through the social service
branch established by the organiza-
tion.

As was expected, the transfer of ex-
ecutive headquarters from the Activi-
ties Hut to Room 801, Cathedral, re-
stricted for a time certain phases of
the YMCA program. However, be-
cause of the central location, the add-
ed use of Room 821, Cathedral, for
recreational use, and the acquisition

‘of the Oakland Club rooms for the use

of luncheon clubs, put the program
back on a normal basis and consider-
ably boosted student interest and par-
ticipation in the unit’s activities.

In examining the report, it was
found that the project which proved
most popular with the student body
was that type which emphasized
recreational and social affairs. Into
this class fall Freshman Camp, which
had a considerable rise in attendance
over previous years, the joint Asso-
ciation nights, the faculty-student
home events, and the recreation room.

Other activities which experienced
added membership were the Monday
and Thursday freshman clubs, the In-
uiry Forum, and the engineering and
pre-medical groups.

Board To Begin
Interviews Today

Five Campus Publications Heads
To Be Chosen After Sessions

Twenty-three members of publica-
tion staffs of the University Will be
interviewed for prospective positions

by the Publications Board today, to-
morrow, and Thursday.

Cap, Gown May Show
In Foster Memorial

According to Theodore W. Biddle, as-
sistant to the dean of men, the next
prodiiction of Cap and Gown, the 30th,
might be given on campus, at the Fost-
er Memorial. If the Memorial is the
site for the show, students will see
it either in February or March. How-
ever, if plans do not work out, the
Nixon will be used as in the past
and performances will be given‘ in
April or May. ,

“No matter which plan is followed,”
said Mr. Biddle yesterday, “books
must be in by October 1. All students,
who want to write the scrip-t for the
next show, should come in to see me,
or make appointments with other
Graduate Cap and Gown men.”

He advised students to join in writ-
ing the books, for co-authors have
turned out the best material. Music
will be asked for by October 15.

Saturday Brings
Close To Spring
Festival Affairs

Track Meets, Carnivals, Tapping,
Floats, Sweepstakes Are Over
For One More Year

By ‘Herbert Rackoff

Amid a whirl of track meets, carni-
vals, happy tappees, dances, and high
school girls with an eye for an ROTC
uniform, the University's annual
Spring Festival came to an end Satur-
day.

According to all reports, the carni-
val held behind Alumni Hall Thursday
evening was by far the most success-
ful and popular event. Enveloped
with the “real carnival spirit,” a large
crowd had the time of its life as it
roamed among roulette wheels, quin-
tuplets, balloons and barkers, or
danced to the music of Herbie Cohen
and his collegians. Margaret Lewis,
Ed36, was chairman of the carnival.

But unique though the carnival was,
it could not favorably compare with

the fact that the four consecutive days P
of Spring Festival week escaped rain. 

Previous to this year, every Spring
Festival, especially when managed by

a Delt, has been at least slightly mar- »

red by rain.

Beginning the festival was a well-
attended tea da.nce Wednesday after-
noon at Webster Hall. And Thursday
afternoon the interfraternity track
meet took place in the Stadium. Kap-
pa Sigma, with its highly-touted “track
team,” had no trouble pacing the ﬁeld
and led with a total of 42 points._Phi
Kappa, in second place, could. obtain
no more than 24.

Friday Big Day

Tap Day, always the most colorful
assembly of the year, had a perfect
setting Friday morning. Held outdoors
under a boiling sun, it was attended
by more than 1,500 students, and con-
tained all the elements of suspense

House! Gets, Then
Breaks University
Spoon On Tap Day

Battered many times during its 64-
year history, the University Spoon
took another one on the chin, or

rather on the handle, right after it
had been presented Friday to Lois
Follansbee, Ed37, and William Housel,
C37.

Housel, after having been thorough-
ly impressed with the importance of
his job in getting the spoon safely
back to the University safe, was walk-
ing carefully up to State Hall, all the
while casting furtive glances about
him and watching for possible spoon-
snatchers.

At the corner of Parkman and Uni-
versity Drives, he accidentally bump-
ed the spoon against his knee, and
then there were two parts to it—the
spoon, that is, not his knee.

With much fear and trepidation,
Housel approached the registrar’s of-
,ﬁce, official harbor of the‘ award, and
learned that little session with a cab-
inet-maker would put the broken
‘spoon back in shape.

Then he started breathing again.

if Panther Wits To Gambol C
' In Spring Edition,
Out Wednesday

 

Reﬁecting the spirit of spring, the
ninth- issue of the Panther will appear
on the campus Wednesday, decked in
_a green cover, it was learned from
-several executives on the Panther
’editorial board today.

Statements about the contents of
the magazine were a. little vague, but
from a compilation of quotations it
appears that the articles will have the
starkness of Poe, the satire of
Voltaire, and a little softer stuff
thown in for. those who like it.

Milton Lehman is the one who goes

and" surprises’ calculated‘ to sustain -in-"#°??‘a. la Poe’ with a “Stephen Leacockney

terest to the very end.

E. A. Holbrook, dean of the School
of Engineering, delivered the main ad-
dress at the assembly, discussing ac-
tivities and their value toward the
building up of a real University. He
encouraged the younger generation to
continue wholeheartedly in college ac-
tivities in the “new way it has set for
itself.”

The Sports Dance Friday night was
in keeping with the rest of the Fos-
tival. Held at the Hotel Schenley, it
was highly colored by the ribbons and
medals of new tappees, and its some
275 couples got a great big kick out of
“Razz Rag,” edited by Israel Goldberg,
C36. Satirizing and ridiculing a great
many prominent people on campus,
it made statements which were almost
‘rash, and which were not vouched for
by their author, In fact, Goldberg has
waived all liability for libel.

An athletic Saturday, in which Pitt
tangled with Notre Dame in a track
meet and staged an exhibition scrub-
varsity football game, brought the Fes-
tival to a ﬁnish.

Business Research Figures

Show Third

For the third successive week, busi-
ness in the Pittsburgh district has
continued to rise and reach a new
high level for recovery period, ac-
cording to the weekly summary of
business condidtions in the Pitts-
burgh district, for the week ending
April 25, published by the Bureau of
Business Research.

Most of the increase was credited
to continued industrial expansion and
substantially heavier freight ship-
ments, especially in the steel indus-
try where gains were reflected in near-
1y all branches of operation. Large
increases in this industry were noted
in tin plate production and in sheet
production.

Week Of Gains

Other industries showing gains on
the index were coal production and
industrial electric power production.

The heavier shipments of coal and
coke raised the total carloadings to
a much higher peak than they were
at the same time last year, and the
index of originating shipments reach-
ed its highest point in the district
since the middle of April, 1931.

Deviation from the general indus-
trial rise was noted in the index of
trade, which ‘continued to show a
slight decline. The drop was account-
ed for by the larger-than-seasonal de-
crease in department store sales. New
motor registrations probably account-
ed for its cost dropping farther, says
the summary.

Engineers Plan Dance

Chemical engineering students are
planning a dance to be held Friday at
the University Club. The affair is In
honor of the alumni, and student
members of the Pittsburgh chapter of
the American Institute of Chemical
Engineers, according to Thomas A-
Napier, president of the AIChE stu-

Figures Indicate
Faculty Stays Longer

Critics who have assailed the Uni-
versity for not insuring its profes-
sors greater security were given
something of an answer by figures
recently disclosed which indicated
that the average length of service
for University professors is now 16
years and four months.

This -represents an increase of
more than seven years over the nine-
year service average recorded at-‘ the
time Chancellor John G. Bowman
came to the University in the fall of
1920.

Additional figures reveal that the
average increased to 10'/2 years by
1925-26 and to 12 years and eight
months by 1930-1931.

Dice Bids Students, Faculty
‘Come Into His Parlor’
At Friday Dinner,

By Richard Cooper

The University Library in the Ca-
thedral is open today.

After a month of planning from
architect’s drawings and working late
into the night, the most important
part of the general collection has
been transfered from State Hall and
is now ready for use.

At a dinner in the Cathedral on Fri-
day evening, J. Howard Dice, Univer-
sity librarian, opened the new li-
brary to the students through their
representatives in the Student-Fac-
ulty Association, the campus publica.
tions, and the Downtown Student As-
sociation.

After the dinner, the group made a
tour of inspection of the new library,
in what Mr. Dice called a “preview.”
William Harvey, C36, chairman of
SFA, officially opened the library by
taking out the ﬁrst book, a seven-
teenth century copy of the New Testa-
ment in Greek and Latin.

informality In Arrangement

The Library, covering the entirel
fourth, ﬁfth, and sixth floors of the
Cathedral, is one of the most up-to-
date and best equipped university li-
braries in the country.

“We have tried to get away from
the old barracks-room type of set-up,”
said Mr, Dice, “The most distinctive
feature of the library’s new quarters
is its informal arrangement. The fur-
niture is the most beautiful and the
most comfortable that could be
found.” ‘

Facilities in the new library are
many times greater than those of the
old rooms in State Hall, according to
Mr_ Dice. In addition to the 120,000
volumes which the stacks are design-
ed to hold 20,000 volumes can be ac-
comodated on shelves in the reading
rooms. ' '

The combined seating capacity of
the reading rooms is 650. On the
sixth ﬂoor are the Men’s Reading
Room, the Darlington Memorial
Room, and the Browsing Room. The
Darlington collection of 14,000
volumes is kept on display in glass-
enclosed walnut shelves, and on the
shelves of the Browsing Room are
3,000 volumes from the Alldred col-
lection.

Electric Book Conveyor

An important feature of the new li-
brary is the electric book conveyor,
which carries books from the stacks
on the fourth ﬂoor to the charging
desk on the fifth ﬂoor. Call slips are
sent down to the attendants in the
stacks through a pneumatic tube. The.
whole procedure takes about three
minutes.

The moving of the library to the
Cathedral was carried on last week
under the supervision of J. E. Mc-
Lean, superintendent of buildings and
grounds. During the daytime the
library staff packed the books into
pine boxes in preparation for the act-
ual transfer of the books, which was
done at night in order to avoid inter-
fering with. classes,

Only books of minor importance re-
main to be transferred. Among those
now in the Cathedral are the Alldred
and Darlington collections, reserve
books, reference books, periodicals,
and books about literature and educa-
tion. No deﬁnite date has been set
for the moving of the rest of the
books.

Because of the greatly increased
size of the library, Mr_ Dice said, it
will be necessary to make the library
staff many times its present num-
ber. As one of the ﬁrst new members
on the staff, Mr. Carroll Reynolds has
been made curator of public docu-
ments and stacks-supervisor.

Educational F”i;ternity
Plans Supper Tonight

Several events for May have been
planned by Delta Delta. Lambda, com-
mercial education fraternity, begin-
ning with a supper meeting for grad-
uate and undergraduate members to-

school day, on May 15, will be com-
mercial students from about 30 high
schools. Following refreshments and
addresses by various speakers, the
group will make a. tour of the campus.

Later in the month an informal tea
will be held at the home of D. D.
Lessenberry, director of commercial
education and faculty adviser for the

More Street Fairs

street fair on Alumni Hall driv6- , . . on

A more one thousand D80Dle, which estimate We c

dancing; and then, perhaps, ascending the grassy terrace
to sit quietly and look down on the gay affalh ,

No one expected so large an. attendance. Tlllle If‘a1rt-v::.1s

turned out, the addition of a few more couples would
have made dancing other than a mere hip SW33’, Well‘
nigh impossible. The herd of unattached males which
suﬂounded the dancing area, and which threatened at
times to surge in and over it was truly unprecedented-

ta ’ .
VVe can only thank the extreme humidity of the evening
for the happy decision which about half of the couples
made to sit half of the time on the terrace. .

what does all this signify? simply that the drlveway
was small and the thing to do next yeal‘ is to ﬁnd 3 bet"

Scale Vve should have several times as many booths,

if‘ our HANCOCK, N. J., is to be congratulated. for it
is t.l1e'University’s loss and the 52nd Coast Artil1ery's
gainthat Captain Donald C. Tredennick, assistant pro-
fessor of Military Science at the University since 1931.
has been transferred there. '
1 Captain Tredennick’s work as drillmaster of the fa-
mous Pitt ROTC band has made that organization one of
the best drilled in American universities. Add to his
ability to command the conﬁdence and respect of the
band and of the ROTC unit the fact that he has been
one of the most popular instructors at the University,
and it will be seen how great will be Pitt’s loss with his
transfer.

AS adviser to Student oyganizatiolls and as a member
of a number of campus societies and fraternities, Captaln
Tredennick has won many friends Who Will Wish him as
great a measure of success at Fort Hancock as he has
enjoyed at the University.-—R. C. M.

We cmhd All Be Tapped

.- E SEE BY THE PAPERS that 98 undergraduates

~ were tapped to honorary fraternities at the ceremo-
nial in front of Memorial Hall Friday. This is ﬁns We
'-are‘ sure that those selected 1‘eD1'eS€Ilt the Very best 111
young manhood and young Womanhood, and have the
‘necessary 15 dollars (or whatever it is), and we feel they
ought to be honored for their accomplishments.

File heard a brilliant suggestion the other day! that We
should organize on campus an honorary unhonorary fra-
ternity for those who have never been tapped. There
would be no initiation fee; there would be no dues.

You would just belong.——R. C. M.

A Great Year Ahead

ROBABLY NO STUDENT in Pitt is saddened by the

thought that we have one month of school, and then
comes summer. He might conceivably be a triﬂe anx-
ious about examinations, and might worry about ﬁnish-
ing a political science term. paper and reading six chap-
ters in economics, but he sees beyond the cloud the clear
blue horizon, and beyond that a summer of hopes and
expectations.

Beyond the summer is something just as good: the re-
turn to school, when one begins to hunger for activity
and life after a hot and sultry, though highly enjoyable,
summer. The return will mean more next Fall than it
usually does. We shall be returning to read in a magm-
ﬁcent new library, open for the ﬁrst time today.

And. in addition to the new library, we shall return to
see a. completed Foster Memorial. Pitt Players will per-
form there next year. The stage will be the most mod-
ern and the most completely equipped in the City- With
a seating capacity of only 1,000 people. there is, h0WeVeI‘,
no limit on the number of nights a show may run. The
next Cap and Gown performance will likewise be pre-
sented in the Memorial, and will I‘1111 fol‘ ’£WO Weeks, ac-
cording to present plans.

In June a year from now, Chancellor Bowman expects
to have the great Commons Room and the Heinz Chapel
finished, he informed a group of students at a. dinner

No, the waiting isn't hopeless.——R. C. M.

 

 

After hearing a few comments, we might suggest to
someone for a college ambition: To write a razz sheet
that is more funny than bitter.

Among The Faculty

By Reuben Slesinger

DOCTOR JOHN H. McFADDEN, professor of psychol-
ogy . . A Dixie man . . he was born in Savannah,
Georgia . . His high school days were spent in Jack-
sonville, Florida . . . In 1912 he graduated from Emory
University, in Georgia In 1922, he received his
Masters degree from the University of North Carolina.

The same university gave him his PhD in 1930

. He began his teaching career at the Emory Uni-

versity in 1923 and stayed till 1926 . . . He came to the

University of Pittsburgh in 1928 and has been here ever
since, teaching psychology all the time . .

As far as personal interests are concerned, Doctor Mc-
Fadden admits that he has no special inspiring one . . .
VVhile in college he mixed in everything . . he was
cadet captain of the ROTC, and senior class president

. His Alma Mater boasted of but one varsity team,
the track team, and Doctor McFadden was the man-
ager .

Likes to rea.d but not in the expected ﬁeld of psychol-
ogy . . . In fact he likes to read anything but the ﬁeld
he teaches, particularly ﬁction, biographies, and plays
. . . Likes the movies, has no favorite actor, with the
questionable exception of W. 0 Fields .

He regrets that music does not in any way move him——
he claims that he is tone deaf and can not appreciate
the beauty of tone and harmony of the classical music

Active sports do not appeal to him very much
. He likes to lie on the sands beneath the sun, is
however fond of swimming . . Doctor McFadden ad-
mits that the faculty of the University is very demo-
cratic and he also admits that he likes Pittsburgh .
Since the South means home to him he prefers the South-
land to any other section of the country . . . Regarding
the tradition of the Southern belle, he believes that the
difference between the Northern woman and the South-
ern woman lies not in the actual features but in the at-
titude adopted towards the stronger sex . . . the North-
ern woman is much more independent .

Doctor McFadden has no intense likes or dislikes .
he does admit however his objections to superﬁciality
and to the covering up of real meanings . . . He is also
annoyed by the misuse of terms such as communism
and socialism He is interested in the function
rather than the appearance of things . . He also be
lieves that if war does come, the complexity of civiliza-
tion will make the participation of the United States in-
evitable .

Doctor McFadden is married and is the father of a
three-year old son.

The First Year

Now that the ﬁrst year of the new marriage course at
Syracuse is nearly over, students who have attended
some or all of the lectures are asked to ﬁll out a ques-
tionnaire from the paper and drop it iii the campus mail
box.

There are ten questions on the blank: Have you found
the course helpful? Should it be conﬁned to seniors?
What aspects emphasized have been most valuable?
What have been least valuable? Do you think the course
should be given with assigned readings? Should the
course be conﬁned only to marriage? What points
should be emphasized more than they were? Could the
course be more valuable if conﬁned to smaller groups?
Do you favor conferences between "students and pro-
fessors in regard to questions discussed in the course?
And what are your suggestions?

   

They Had A Flood, Too

At the Johnstown center of the University, laboratory
classes in chemistry have been conducted by blackboard
illustrations since the ﬂood but are now back in their
former quarters. Seventy-ﬁve per cent of the glass in
the lab rooms was found intact and able to be used. In-
dividual lockers are not in use. Equipment is placed out
for all chem students. Breakage fees will be levied ac-
cording to the average breakage of the classes.

Doing It Up Written
Brown University has eliminated mid-year examina-
tions and semester grades in full-year courses.

Seems Rather Strange

Lehigh claims to have an absent-minded professor. One
story about him says that after lecturing for an hour
be assigned problems in “the text.” Upon remonstrances
from the students, he learned that no text book was used
in that course. After examining his notes he discovered
he had delivered the wrong lecture.

Well, Well, Well!

Dr. Victor E. Levine, head of the biochemistry and
nutrition department of the Creighton University Schoool
of Medicine at Omaha, Nebraska, says that “Men are
deserting nicotine because they consider smoking to be
effeminate since so many women have taken up the habit,
a.nd in thirty years only the fair sex will smoke.”

Registrar Welcomes
High School Seniors

Substituting for Chancellor Bowman,
John G. Quick, registrar of the Uni.
yersity, welcomed the high school sen-
1OI‘S assembled in Memorial Hall, Fri-
day afternoon,

Stressing the ideals for which the
University stands, Mr. Quick pointed
to the Cathedral, the Foster Memorial,
and Heinz Chapel as examples of beau-
ty, music, and religion.

Dr. John B. Sutherland, coach of
the football team, was the main speak-
er. He told the visitors of sportsman-
ship, another phase of University life.
William Ha1‘V6y. C36, president of
SFA, gave a student's viewpoint of
the meaning of college life,

Following the assembly, ROTC men
served as guides in showing the guests
the ROTC parade, the ﬂoat parade,
and the Sweepstakes,

They then conducted the visitors to
the Cathedral, where they viewed the
new library, and watched the Pirate-
Bee game from‘ the 36th ﬂoor.

High School Day was under the
chairmanship of David Racusin, BA37.

J. Fisher, instructor in accounting,
who has been investigating the prob-
lem of currency and stabilization, and

study.

Mr. Fisher feels that three groups
of countries will have to be recon-
ciled in regard to: attitudes and plans
before a deﬁnite program of stabiliza-

May We

tion can be established. These Arrange Your
groups include: Great Britain, and

other countries whose currencies

ﬂuctuate with the pound sterling; 

France, and other countries of the
gold bloc; and the United States.

The British authorities talk much
about stabilization, but have failed to
take deﬁnite steps leading to such an
end. Britain’s monetary policy seems
to look toward a higher price level
than the present level, before stabil-
ization would occur.

Only those business groups whose
operations are directly disturbed by
ﬂuctuations in exchange rates are
especially desirous of establishing im-
mediate stabilization. The internal
business groups prefer to allow the
price level to take its natural course -
rather than take steps toward stabil-
ization,

Great Britain's failure to stress im-
mediate stabilization may be attribut-
ed to the fact that Great Britain is
still mindful of the result of the re-
sumption of the gold standard too
hastily in 1925. They do not wish to
repeat the mistake, according to Mr.
Fisher,

‘The gold bloc is strongly in favor
of a currency stabilization which
would assist them in defending their
present currency, that is, to retain
the gold standard.

France, particularly, does not wish
either to abandon the gold standard,

Kappa Sigs Walk
Away With Greek
Track Meet Title

Phi Kappa Gets Second Place, 18
Points Behind Pace-Setters;
Phi Delts Place Third

When better loving cups are to be
won, it seems that Kappa Sigma will
win them. Thursday, the Dithridge
Street athletes ambled up to the Sta-
dium, put on their track suits, and
hot-footed it way out into the front
of the Interfraternity pack to break
the tape with such regularity that
team honors in Spring Festival’s track
and ﬁeld meet belonged solely to Kap-
pa Sigma.

Six ﬁrsts and four second places ag-
gregated a total of 42 points for the
Red and White. This placed them
fully 18 points above their nearest
rival, Phi Kappa, boasting 24. A
slight indication of their supremacy
may be had by noting that they had
six winners in 11 events, three of
which were won by independent en-
tries. In the 220-yard dash, McMunn
of Kappa Sigma crossed the ﬁnish
line ﬁrst, but was later disqualiﬁed for
stepping out of his lane.

-M arty Groat Stars

Individual honors went to Kappa
Sigma’s chief point-maker, Marty
Groat, He is the brother of track let-
terman Charley Groat. Although he
isn't a letterman himself, he cuts a
fancy ﬁgure on any man’s track and
ﬁeld. His three ﬁrst places account-
ed for exactly 15 of Kappa Sigma’s 42
points. Two jumps won ten points.
In the high jump he went 5 feet, 7
inches above grass level and in the
running broad jump he hurtled him-
self into the pit over a distance of
19 feet, 1% inches.

His time of 56.7 seconds in the 440-
yard dash beat out the Kappa Sig
prexy, Gordon Rauck, by six yards and
captured the event.

Runner-up distinction went to bas-
ketball player Eddie Spotovich. A
newcomer to track and ﬁeld events,
he showed that he could do more than
just heave that basketball around the
Stadium pavilion.- He tossed the
baseball 229 feet, four feet more than
his basketball team-mate, Bill I\lickel,
and a good many feet more than the
other tosses. After that he won his
second medal by shotputting 44 feet,
9 inches.

Monopoly In Cent‘ury Dash

Another Kappa Sig ﬁrst place was
in the three—legged race, won by the
team of McMunn and Bernie Sum-
mer. Their time of 8 minutes, one
second, for the. 50-yard event was bet-
tered in a prelimina.ry heat by the Pi
Lam team of Gluck and Berlin. Their
time was 7.7-, but in the ﬁnals the belt
connecting their legs fell off and put
them out of the race.

The 100-yard dash was almost a
Kappa Sig monopoly, Former Olson-
man, Mclllunn, was ﬁrst and McMoni-
gle was second. Nape Hepburn, the
Delt speedster, ﬁnished third.

Joe Garcia, another one of the good
Dr. Carlson’s boys, became an individ-
ual star in his own right, by winning
the pole vault and placing second to
Great in the high jump. He may get
that jumping spring from jumping
center on the Panthers basketball
team.

Grosscope’s pole-vaulting and Cash-
dollar's shot-putting were instru-
mental in earning a third place rating
for Phi Delta Theta. Delta Tau Delta
was fourth with 10 points, followed
by Sigma Alpha Mu with 6, Phi Gam-
ma Delta with 4, and Pi Lambda Phi
with 1.

An Old Story,

The Pitt News

Same Ending

History repeated itself when Bob Madden took over Ralph Bald
Friday afternoon to complete the University tennis tournament, begun
last fall and postponed for a matter of a few months while snow flurried

and days were too cold for raoquetmen.
He’s at the right in the above picture.

Bob Madden’s Tennis Shots,

Wisecracks Lead To Crown

 

Under a sweltering sun, Bob Mad-
den defeated his playful doubles part-
ner, Ralph Bald, 6-4, 6-0, 11-9, for the
singles championship of the Univer-
sity at the Stadium courts Friday.
Play was hindered by the scorching
condition of the courts and the wise-
cracks that ﬂoated around between
the two contenders.

Madden, his serve working perfectly,
rushed Bald off his feet to take the
ﬁrst four games of the ﬁrst set with
ease, Bald staged a comeback to
bring the scor'e in games‘ to 5-4’, but
this was of no avail as Madden put
on the pressure to run out the set,
6-4.

In the second set, Madden display-
ed his best form of the year to bewil-
der Bald completely with cross—court
shots and a sizzling backhand that
just nicked the baseline to capture a
love set. ;

After a brief rest, Madden and Bald
changed courts for what proved to be
the third and ﬁnal set of the match.
Bald started slowly again, dropping
the ﬁrst three games, but rallied to
bring the count to 5 all.

With both boys exchanging court-
length drives and snatching the
other’s service, the score was tied at
8 games apiece. Madden’s experience
proved too much for his Mount Leb-
anon rival, as Bald dropped the ﬁnal
set, 11-9, to give Madden his second
all-University singles championship.

The match wound up the all-Univer-
sity tennis tourney which started late
last October with 72 entrants.

Pitt’s new‘ tennis champion is well-
rounded as far as activities go. Be-
sides his tennis-playing, which takes
up all the time he devotes to athletics,
he is a footlight performer of some re-
nown. In the Pitt Players ﬁrst pro-
duction this year, “The Show-Off,” he
played the leading romantic role. In
this year’s Cap and Gown show, he
covered his muscular limbs under a
pair of silk stockings and took the
part of a swell-looking girl. He is
the smaller portion of the Madden
brother act which has played a. prom-
inent part in Pitt activities.

Ralph Bald, the runner-up, is a grad-
uate of Mount Lebanon High School,
Where he captained the tennis team to
several titles. He is only a sopho-
more and played number one on last
year’s freshman team.

Freshmen Begin
Tennis Tourney

Elimination Will Decide Make-Up
Of Season’s Yearling Team

 

Under the direction of Coach David
O’Loughlin and Manager Eugene
Cohen, a freshman tennis elimination
tournament starts this afternoon to
determine the starting lineup for the
Panther yearlings in their inaugural
match against the Duquesne fresh-
men.

Well over 20 candidates will be
stroking for positions o11 the Sta-
dium courts, Several outstanding
scholastic stars will resume from
where they left off last summer to
capture new honors.

The ﬁeld is headed by Blatt, PAA
netman, who is seeded No. 1 and
Adrian Hartman, who was the city
scholastic ﬁnalist for the last three
years. Not to be overlooked all: the
erratic Bob Culp and Ray Ligert, Ohio
scholastic sensation.

The pairings for this afternoon are
as follows: Blatt vs. Sage; Schultz
vs. Kunkel; Calloman vs. Bright;
Johnston vs. Culp; Light vs. Bellas;
McLaughlin vs. Markey; Robb vs.
Kairys; Mugianis vs. Hartman; Shel-
ton vs. Lewis (bye).

An attractive schedule has been
drawn up for the little Panther net-
men, The yearlings pry open the lid
with the Duquesne Dukes across the
Stadium courts Monday, May 11. The
team then takes to the road, meeting
the Tech plebes, the Mount Lebanon

Mushball Schedules Released Today

Set back a week because of the
Spring Festival activity, mushball is
now ready to take its place on the
Intramural program Play will be-
gin either tomorrow or Wednesday.

With the entry dealine having been
extended, the size and the number
of the various leagues has not been

«deﬁnitely decided. At least one thing
is certain, that the fraternity en-
tries, totaling 13, will be divided into
"three leagues.

Entries from the Independent com-
petitors include ﬁlled—out blanks from
the Kappa Alpha Phis, champion last
year, the Chem Engineers, and a new
entry, the Student Alliance.

Five ﬁelds have been engaged for
the competition. ' Schenley Oval,
Trees Field, and the leveled ground
behind the Trees gymnasium will
serve as the respective battlegrounds.

Schedules will be released today
by Martin J. Feely and William
Housel, chairman of Interfraternity

athletics.

Pitt Net Team
Downs Dukes, 9-0

McKenna.-Thompson, Locke-Helm
Click As New Doubles Teams

That Pitt athletics is booming along
to the 1935-36 season's high point is
being daily borne out by each day of
spring sports competition. That this
year’s crack tennis brigade is one of
the chief factors in that spring
splurge is being brought out by each
court match. Thursday, the Pitt ten
nis team cannonaded its second com-
petitor, Duquesne, by -the top-heavy
score of 9-0.

So relentless was the attack of the
Panther racqueteers that the boys
from over on top of the bluff were
able to win only one set in the best-
out-of-three set matches. Even that
was somewhat of a ﬂuke. Joe Mad-
den, playing Celio Cappeli in the num-
ber three match, won his ﬁrst set,
6-2, and was well on his way to
clinching the match with a 5-1 lead in
games and a 40-love, set point advant-
age. He wanted to win the set with
an ace, and in so trying, wasted six
balls, which meant the game. Event-
ually, this meant the set, 6-8. He
won the next set, however, 6-0, to win
his one point for the team total.

Ba'ld, Madden Invincible

Bob Madden had little diﬁiculty in
trimming Harry Milton, 6-2 and 7-5.
Even better stroking was shown by
number two man, Ralph Bald, who
goose-egged, Ben Allison, 6-0, 6-0.
Bald and Madden teamed together
to form an invincible doubles combin-
ation. They defeated Milton and Al-
lison, 6-1, 6-0.

Other singles engagements were
won in the same convincing manner

by the three other singles players of

the powerful Pitt aggregation. Roy
Heckler shellacked Bill Weber, 6-1,
8-2. Irv Solow didn't have to turn
the pressure on to defeat Larry
O’Leary, 63, 6-0'. And Johnny Mogan
competed the victory parade with a
6-3, 6-2 triumph over Rodney McGuin-
ess.

Two experimental doubles duos
were tried for the ﬁrst time Thursday,
and they clicked as well as the re-
mainder of the team. McKenna and
Thompson trounced McConnell and
Weber, 6-4, 6-0. Locke and Ed Helm
defeated McGuiness and O’Leary,
6-3, 6-3.

Phi Gamma Delta
Wins Sweepstake
Event At Festival

Delta Tau Delta Takes Second;
Two SAE Racers Injured
As Pushcart Upsets

 

The Phi Gamma Delta entry, con-
sisting of a four-horse parlay and one
jockey, roared down the stretch to
ﬁnish ﬁrst in the Pitt Asphalt Derby
just about 24 hours before the winner
galloped home in the Kentucky Der-
by, and was just about as winded.

With Fred Edwards, Panther cheer-
leader, resorting to all of his best
yells to coax a little more push out of
the pushing power behind him, the
Fiji cart crossed the ﬁnish line in 4
minutes and one second. The time
did not come close to previous rec-
ords, despite a fast track and perfect
weather conditions.
Art Williams, Henry Sawin, Paul
Jennings, and John Danton were the
boys who donned shorts and the Phi
Gam basketball shirts to supply loco-
motive power for the winning entry.
Guided by Charles Bucher, the Del-
ta Tau Delta cart squeaked home in 4
minutes and six seconds to cop sec-
ond honors in the sweepstakes. Al
Duff, Don Thompson, Fred Hurlinger
and Nape Hepburn did the pushing
behind the second-place energy buggy.

Those interested in statistics might
be comforted to learn that this was
the second successive year in which
the Delts ﬁnished second. Kappa Sig-
ma took ﬁrst honors last year.

Upset Features

The crowd gathered at the “suicide
corner,” which on all other occasions
is, referred to as Bigelow and Bayard,
didn’t get much of a treat.

Instead, the excitement took’ place
at the corner of Center Avenue and
Belleﬁeld Street. Here the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon cart, with Oscar Sim-
mons at the controls, ground-looped as
it was rounding the turn with all
speeds forward. Simmons was hurled
from the driver’s seat and Bob Alston,
pushing the cart, ma.de a three-point
landing on the pavement.

Both boys suffered only brush
bruises in the falls, but the Sigma
Chi pushmobile, following close be-
hind, was not able to avoid the pair
and the light buggy hurtled over Sim-
mons and Alston as they lay on the
ground.

Both In Good Shape

Latest reports indicate that Sim-
mons has completely recovered from
his injuries, while Alston still is nurs-
lng a few cuts and bruises.

Otherwise, the race, run in two
heats and against time, was as free
from thrills as a chaperone at a house
party. _

Cups were presented to the Phi
Gamma Delta ‘and Delta Tau Delta
repgresent-atives during an intermis-
sion at the Spring Festival dance.

bookstore, the course of the race ran
down Bayard Street to Belleﬁeld, up
Belleﬁeld to Center Avenue, then
came the long grind up to Bigelow
Boulevard, followed by the wild dash
downhill to the corner of Bayard and
Bigelow, and ﬁnally the home stretch
to the ﬁnish line at Parkman Drive.
Motorcycle policemen, who loosed
more sirens than a \Hol1YW00d P1‘0d11C‘
tion manager, drew spasms of ap-
plause from the gallery of University
and high school students.

Golfers Go Into The

Maybe it was stage-fright or maybe
it was just the superior playing of
the Penn team, but whatever it was,
the debut of the Pitt golf team in the
Eastern Intercollegiate Golf Confer-
ence was not as auspicious as had
been expected.

The Panthers were defeated in their
ﬁrst league match Friday by the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, 6-3, at the
Columbia Country Club, Washiiigton,
D. C.

It was the lower end of the Pitt
golﬁng order that fell down, account-
in for the defeat. Pat Symonds,
the dependable number one man, a.nd
Frank Souchak, whose prodigious
driving makes him a capable number
two man, defeated the one and two
of Pennsylvania's golf squad. Sym-
onds won his match on the 16th hole,
3 and 2, while Souchak was carried
to the 18th green where he triumphed,
1 up.

These two victories scored two of
the three Pitt points. The other point
was also made by the Symonds-Sou-
chak duo. They teamed together
against the top two Penn men to win

Tri-Delts Capture Float Prize

With Mary,

Imported Lamb

 

According to the awards lnade at the Spring Festival dance, two
young ladies named Mary and a stray gray lanlb adopted by the Tri-
Delts proved the hits of last Friday ’s ﬂoat parade. The ﬁrst prize
trophy was given to Delta Delta Delta for their interpretation of the
rhyme, “Mary Had A Little Lamb,” a.nd the second award went to
Kappa Kappa Gamma which presented a garden with ﬂower-covered
fence, and lady—like sunﬂowers to the theme of “Mary, Mary, Quite
Contrary.” Zeta Tau Alpha’s pastry picture, “Sing A Song Of Six-
pence,” received ﬁrst honorable mention.

Women of the campus .
world encountered unexpected dlf-
ﬁculties Friday for their annual Float
Parade when only nine of the 14 char-
tered trucks appeared at the corner of
Bayard and Belleﬁeld at 11:30 o clock,-
the time designated for the a1‘r1Va1
of the undecorated trucks.

And so, women of at least four fra-
ternities were warm not only because
of the weather but because it was ap-
parent that there would be no ﬂoat
for any of these slsterhoods when
parade time arrived.

In order to have all entries appeal’-
the chairman, Margaret Sheer, Ed36,
arranged for a parade in two sections,
one before the ROTC Parade and
Sweepstakes, the other to follow the
latter. Thus it was that 13 ﬁnolatﬁ
ﬁnally passed before the Judges: 1S~
Emily Irvine, Mlss Thyrsa W. Amos:
Dr. Florence Teagarden, Dr. ‘d1 .
Andrew Cleven, and N. Robert Sel e.

The ﬁrst shift of the Mother Goose
Parade to turn down BaYa1‘d Street
included “The Queen.of Hearts’ and
her court of Beta Sigma Omlcrons,
then the Kappa Kappa_Gamma ‘fer;
sion of “Mary, Mary, Q_u1te C0I,1t1‘6}}Yv

Women Debaters
Hold Last Dinner

Work Accomplished During Year,
Banquet With Men Discussed

Tentative plans for next year’s pro-
gram and a review of the past year’s
work were discussed at the Women’s
Debating Association’s ﬁnal dinner
meeting of the semester last Thursday
night.

Following a report on the upperclass
intercollegiate and extension debates
held since September, Phyllis Burger,
C39, summarized the work done
by Pitt Parlance, freshman debating
unit. The unit this year has held dis-
cussions on the relative values of the
panel and the formal debate, has made
voice recordings for all its members,
and has brought to the campus as
guest speaker, John Henry, authority
on the Supreme Court.

In a feature debate, members of the
unit pretended that they were the of-
ﬁcial tasters of America and argued
to a tie on whether or not they should
taste alcoholic beverages in the regu-
lar routine of their work.

Discussions on coeducation, the Su-
preme Court, types of speech, and how
to speak were also held by the unit.

Plans were also made at the meet-
ing for the annual banquet held joint-
ly by the Men's and Women’s Debat-
ing Associations, at which the yearly
awards to debaters are made; the tap-
pees to Delta Sigma Rho, national
honorary forensic fraternity, are an-
nounced; and the Delta Sigma. Rho
gavel is presented to someone who has
done outstanding work in the ﬁeld of
public speaking.
