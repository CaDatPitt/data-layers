Dr. King's wife speaks

By Ed Abolins
Staff Writer

Coretta Scott King shared some
personal feelings and memories
about her involvement in the Civil
Rights Movement as she spoke to
a crowded chapel on the campus
of Chatham College yesterday.

She said it was her destiny to
meet Reverend Martin Luther
King, Jr., and that together they
were “called to be in the forefront
of a movement that made this
country more democratic and
more inclusive.”

. A Her speech was part of
Chatham College’s observance of
Black History Month, a month
that King said is important to all

races and cultures in America.

‘The impact of the Black expe-
rience in America has an inﬂu-
ence on every aspect of American
life,” said King, as she addressed
the capacity crowd at the
Campbell Memorial Chapel. “If
we can build bridges of knowl-
edge and understanding between
races, we can build a better soci-
ety.”

King said that Black history
should be studied at all times
because it is a vital part of
American history. She added that
all races in America should learn
about each other’s histories in
order to overcome racism, a phe-
nomenon that King identiﬁed as
the source of many of America’s

current social crises.

- “Racism hurts all Americans. It
divides people of all races who
would otherwise share common
interests. It is turning many of our
cities into ghost towns,” said
King.

She recalled her husband’s
belief that “racial understanding is
not something we find, it is some-
thing we create,” and she stressed
the importance of maintaining

contact between’ different races in ..

order to achieve racial under-
standing.

According to King, the Civil
Rights Movement was a first step
towards this goal.

the three most important
goals in achieving his
vision:

°To ensure that all busi-

the primary academic
mission of the university.
°Instill the belief that we

African-American display featured at Hi//man

By Erica Glasspool
Staff Writer '

Showcases filled with brightly col-
ored books, dolls and pictures were
set up by the School of Library and
Information Science to pay tribute to
African-American librarians and
authors during black history month.

Two different exhibits, one located
on the third floor of SLIS and the
other in the lobby of Hillman library,
contain biographies, music and games
set up by Stephanie J. Johnson,’ Sheree
White and Veronica A. Davis, alumni
of SLIS.

The display at Hillman library hon-
ors past, present and future librarians
from different parts of the country
who are in school, have just graduated
or “who have already made their con-
tribution and paved the way for future
librarians,” said Johnson.

The registered theme above
the many pictures and biographies
reads, “A Salute To Cultural
Keepers.” In the middle of the
three cases, Dr. E.B. Josey is
paid tribute for being a pioneer in the
field of library and information sci-
ence for co—founding the Black
Caucus.

The Black Caucus is a special
group of the American Library
Association made up of African-
Americans. ~

At SLIS, children’s literature is fea-
tured not only regarding African-
American ancestry, but also African
and Caribbean with the overall theme
— “The Future of'Our Community
Lies in Our Children.”

Besides popular books such as
E.B.White’s “Charlotte’s Web”'and
Julius Lester's “Brer Rabbit,” the
showcase holds other popular chil-

' dren’s toys. -

Underneath a fan of posters display-
ing “Poems from Nigeria” and
Caribbean Literature, cases are
lined with dolls like Marimba,
an African-American Raggedy
Ann, and a Monopoly-type
game called Uptown Squares, featur-
ing squares such as Zulu arts
and crafts and Sanford ‘and Son
Furniture.

Dr. Carter G. Woodson started the
annual observance of past and present
achievements of African-Americans in
February ofl926 which was called

_ Negro History Week.

In 1970 the observance was changed
to Black History Week and in
1976 it became Black History

Month. Woodson, who earned a’

Ph.D. in history, is considered
the Father of Black History, said
Johnson.

°From page 1

The actual report, entitled
“Meeting the Challenge to
Change”, was distributed at
Monday’s meeting and outlined
the areas in which “meaningful
change” had been accomplished.

“Make no mistake about it,”
Tuchi said about bringing
change. “That’s what my inten-
tion was coming in, and it’s my
intention now and will be.”

In the cost savings/revenue
enhancement category, the
report indicated that business
and finance had taken steps that
saved the university $16,901,257
over the past two years.

“The people of business
and finance fooled me nicely,”
Tuchi said. “In the past year I
estimated at the beginning that

the second year would yield

about $3.5 million, and the result
was $8.5.”

According to this report, a
large factor in these savings was
the renegotiating of agreements
with, or changing of, vendors.
This process saved the university

   

$2,473,263 - in 1993, and
$2,304,455 in 1994.

Additional investment income
gave the university an additional
$3,015,500 in 1993, and
$455,000 in 1994.

Energy conservation programs
saved the university $452,000 in
1993, and $1,075,651 in 1994.
These figures indicate an
increased amount saved over the
previous year’s savings.

According to the report, busi-
ness and finance has placed a top
priority on customer service.

“I have a belief that says when
one prioritizes, there is a number
one, and a number two,” Tuchi

said. “Our first clientele as we

see it is the student. Second is
that of the faculty and staff.”

Tuchi said the changes in cus-
tomer service were made with
an emphasis on the student. He
mentioned the construction of
Schenley Cafe in the William
Pitt Union, and Eddiefs beneath
Tower A. .

“I find Eddie’s, as a food
court, the best I’ve ever seen in

the world,” Senate Council
President ‘James Holland said. “I

' ﬁnd food courts ordinarily very

unappealing and unappetizing.
Eddie’s is just great. It’s fun to
eat there, and attractive.”

Other improvements in stu-
dent services include the renova-
tion of Brackenridge Hall
toward suite-style living similar
to Sutherland Hall, computer
training for freshmen, the expan-
sion of the university’s trans-
portation from one bus and one
route to five busses and three
shuttles and eight routes,
improved lighting throughout
the campus and the ability for
the student to access up-to-date
registration information on ISIS-
INFO.

According to the report,-

improvements for faculty and
staff have also been made.
Available staff positions can be

accessed via Pittlnfo. In addi- ‘

tion, there is an early retirement
plan, and a program in which

"faculty/staff members receive

financial incentives for utilizing

implemented.

According to the report, busi-
ness and finance also focused on
making productivity improve-
ments and challenged personnel
to findbetter ways to’ get their
jobs done. These changes also
result in cost savings/revenue
enhancements. ,

The report indicates that all

productivity improvements are '
customer-service oriented in that '

they either save business and
ﬁnance’s customers time, or free
and finance
resources to be dedicated to bet-
ter serve its customers.

The report goes on to mention
other changes in the university
and ends with some changes
expected to takeplace in the
future. -

Among these changes are the
completion of the
Environmental
Agency sponsored Green Lights
Program, which could save the

university $600,000 by the end

of fiscal year 1997.

Opinions  
The power of plastic

Consider the power of your I.D. card for a moment. With it, you
can get into a residence hall or two, get meals, buy food on choice
dollars outside the cafeterias and check out books from the hbrary.

What if that power could be expanded to such tlungs as buying
books, withdrawing cash at automatic teller machines and holding
information about your student status? These things may be possible.
A team of CGS and graduate student governments, along with facul-
ty and adminsitiators, are working to expand the power of the I.D.
cards.

The current I.D. production system is obsolete, according to the
team, and after June 30, the current vendor will no longer extend the
service contract on it. So the change over to a different type of card
would come regardless.

Currently, CAS’s student government is not part of the team,
though SGB President Julie Crowell told The Pitt News that she
thinks “It’s a wonderful begimiing to preparing Pitt for the future.”
SGB should get involved with this project to make sure that under-
graduate interests are represented in the new design.

The new I.D. cards, if they are to have a debit function, should be
able to be used with vending machines and photocopiers, replacing
the current venda-card system. They could alsopbe made to function

.with security doors by means of a magnetic stripe. Finally, there
should be some way to connect the student record to the cards so that
registration’ could be made easier.

Mccarthyism revisited Lierol bias in American m

McCarthyism is not dead in this country. In the bombing trial of
Shiek Omar Abdel—Rachinan and his alleged co-conspirators, prose-
cutors have released a list of “possible unindited co-conspirators”
according to a report in USAToday. The list, releasedby the U.S.
attorney’s office, has 172 names on it, including the Sudanese
Mission to the United Nations. This is a ﬂagrant example of guilt by
association. The list is being used so that prosecutors can enter
remarks made by these people which would otherwise be hearsay
evidence. '

If there is enough evidence to justify their being named as co-con-
spirators, then why aren’t they being indicted? Terrorism is a fairly
serious crime, especially when the terrorists are on American soil.
Merely naming these alleged co-conspirators is not enough. They
should be jailed so that they cannot engage in any further conspira-
cies to disrupt the American way of life. Listing entire Sudanese mis-
sion to the United Nations is going a bit overboard. Terrorism is a
serious problem, but if those who would protect us from it would

. destroy our way of life to do so, then the point is moot. With com-
munism gone, is the country so desperate for a new enemy—of-the-
monthgthat it has to begin singling out a new group for camps in
Arizona? Remember the madness which prevailed during World
War II, when this country jailed a population whose members proved
their loyalty ? Those named are considering a lawsuit against the
United States. In the light of Korumatsu v. the U.S., blanket accusa-
tions like this should not be made.

uring a
recent
interview

«I did with
Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette colum-

' V   nist Brian
Coluniinst O’Neill, he said
Rick that he occa-
~ Nowlin sionally listened
to right-wing

radio talkmeister Rush

Limbaugh in part to get material

, for his columns. One thing that

Rush does (I only know this
second-hand, since I refuse to
waste my time listening to him)
is to preface a particular news
item with, “You won’t hear this
in mainstream media!”

Which, Brian said, is just not
true.

You have undoubtedly heard
for years from conservatives
that major news media are
hopelessly liberal and that cor-
rective “balance” is needed to
save them from themselves.
One conservative activist (Tim
LaHaye, I think) even suggested
that reporters’ political affilia-
tions be registered. This may be
hard for some of you to hear,
but people who tell you that
there is an intentional “left-
wing” bias in the news media
are lying. The myth of the liber-
al news media is just that — a
myth.

So why doesn’t the right like
the news media? Simple —
control. The people who say
that they want the media to
reﬂect their values really mean,
“We want it to reflect ONLY
our values.” They only want to
politicize the news, to slant it in

a way that they feel comfortable.

with. (For example, I had to
stop watching the 700 Club
about nine years ago because
that program did reports which
were either just plain wrong or
didn’t tell the whole story.)
Such calls for what I consider
outright censorship have been
around since, ironically, the
1960s, when journalists became
more independent and reported

whatever they felt to be a good
story no matter how embarrass-
ing or controversial. That inde-
pendence apparently threatens
conservatives, who are admit-
tedly in the majority but certain-
ly have no monopoly on the
truth.

I was surprised to learn that in
the earliest days of the United
States (a time some conserva-
tives would love to return to),
most newspapers were actually
little more than mouthpieces of
political parties; there was no
such thing as “objective joumal-
ism” as we know it today. And

while all news reports are at

least a little biased even today
(as human beings dealing with
finite information, that’s
inevitable), as a source of infor-
mation, today you’ll still get
more of the truth than before.

/1 recall one poll that was
taken to gauge the political
leanings of certain reporters,
and it noted that 44 percent
were Democrats and just 16
percent were Republicans, com-
pared to 30 and 25 respectively
about 25 years ago. But conser-
vatives, most of them registered
Republicans these days, tend to
overlook that, until the 1960s,
the media were made up almost
exclusively of white men. (It
took the Los Angeles Times up
to the time of the 1965 Watts
riots for it to hire a black
reporter, for example.) The vast
majority of racial minorities in
the media are there because of
liberal activism.

Working women tend to be
less liberal than minorities but

still are more so than the gener- '

al population. Some conserva-
tives have the concept that
women should get manied, stay
home and have children and
therefore don’t belong in the
newsroom or anywhere else in
the workplace —— ridiculous for
some and downright economi-
cally unrealistic for others. For
this reason feminist ideology
gets more coverage than it may
warrant.

eciio is a mylh

But so much for reporters.
What about owners of major
newspapers and television sta-
tions, most of whom are conser-
vative? Wouldn’t that, in a
sense, give some sort of balance
to the news? Or is balance what
the right really wants?

That partially explains the
recent rise in talk radio shows,
three-quarters of them conserv-
ative, which is no surprise to me
because, as O’Neill said in that
interview, “people don’t want to
think for themselves.” Indeed,
Rush is so popular not because
he’s right (most of the time he
isn’t) but because he tells peo-
ple what they want, rather than
need, to hear. To “dittoheads”

and those of like mind, liberal- I

ism only serves to provide a
convenient target. I remembered
that last year, when I had the
misfortune of being a guest on
conservative campus activist
Booker Stallworth’s radio show
“By the Book.” I knew ahead of
time he would probably try to

make an idiot out of me,

Fortunately, I was ready.

Not all “right-wingers” are so
closed-minded, though. Once in
a while, some fair-minded con-
servatives actually try to pro-
mote dialogue. For example,
once a month I do “altemative
commentary?’ for “Pittsburgh
Talks,” a daily talk show on a
Christian-oriented" radio station
mentioned below. And while
the show is conservative, liber-
als do make appearances from

time to time. (Kudos to host '

Mark Elfstrand for recogrnzing
other views.)

I once told a friend of mine
who maintains that the media
lean to the left, “The problem
isn’t so much that the media are
biased — it’s that you are.”
Once we understand that, and
check out the information for
ourselves, the complaints
should stop.

Mexico deserves no more

Upon hearing the recent news that
President Clinton plans to give Mexico 20
billion dollars without approval of
Congress’, only one question comes to
mind —-— how much more?

How much more do we have to give
Mexico and its people? This is a country
that has never repaid a loan to us. They

have terrible credit and have had to sus- *

pend payments on the interest of their debt
many times. They then refinance their
loans at lower interest and thus go further

into debt. Do we really expect to see this .

money again in any form, be it repayment
or in economic stimulation. '

This is the same country whose illegal
immigrants cost us billions each year to
take care of them. When they come here
we manage to educate them at no cost to
them, and give medical treatment. But in
their country to-get an education you must
be born Mexican, and prove it. Mexico
does not cooperate with our law enforce-
ment agencies — they have never extradit-
ed one criminal.

Mexico is not that important to us eco-
nomically that we have to bail them out.
One must wonder where the money will
go in a country that is politically corrupt as
well. If Clinton is so worried about our
economy, then why doesn’t he "pump it into
ours. Better yet, give it back to the
American people, thus creating a boom.
Mexico should not get, nor do they
deserve, more help from the United States
until they give something back.

Penal system unjust

Your editorial of Feb. 7, “Neighbors
aren’t jailers,” left a lot of unanswered
questions, and only contradicts what the
editors try to convey at every opportunity.

Does The Pitt News believe that the cur-
rent penal system is fair_and just? That
anyone who enters _and leaves it — will not
commit a crime again, and has truly been
punishedand that the system completed its

job? That is what your editorial leads to
believe. '

If The Pitt News has done any research,
it will be shown that criminals do not com-
plete the time that they were sentenced to
in jail. It will show that the criminals are
not counseled. It will also show that prison
overcrowding and lack of funds are the
biggest forces behind paroles — especially
early paroles.

Furthermore, the editorial stated that the
parole system leads to a police state. If The
Pitt News knew anything about the parole
system, no comment like that could be
made. The editorial also wants us to
believe that if communities innocently
lived together without suspicion of poten-
tial danger,repeat offenses from individu-
als will not occur and communities will be
free of crime. That is pure silliness.

What really solves the alleged problem
of the popular notiﬁcation laws is a justice
system that makes sure criminals do the
time they were sentenced, longer sentences
and less paroles (which The Pitt News sup-
ports), which means, more money and
more jails. '

BLOCKS can't be easier

My first response to “BLOCK Plan to
Undergo ‘Changes’? (2/7) was anger. I used
to believe college prepared us for life in the
real world and that we were to be treated as
adults and the future of our country.

The future looks bleak if the next
generation can’t even manage their food
intake. .

Last year I ate l0-ll meals per week on
the l4—meal program, and my case was not
uncommon. Also, a student could only use

a certain number of blocks per meal, day _

and week.

The BLOCK plan is better than the old
system, but that is what we will revert to
because some moaning “college students”
can’t follow a simple chart that is posted in
every cafeteria, mailed to students and
published in The Pitt News.

I can’t think of any other way students
could have an easier time with BLOCKS

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

unless someone held their hand and calcu-
lated everything out for them.

I understand that freshmen must buy 250
or 280 BLOCKS, but the only real differ-
ence from the weekly plan is at the end of
the semester students see exactly how
many blocks were wasted. -

Isee nothing wrong with the current
BLOCK plan. The first semester was a
test, and all the major problems were
ironed out.

The plan does call for responsibility on
the part of students, but that is what college
is all about. How will the future generation
ever balance a checkbook if we can’t even
budget our BLOCKS?

Pilt doesn't want harmony

Erika Kendra’s diversity article has been
a very hot topic of conversation in The Pitt
News and it’s time that someone defends
her ﬁne writing. When I was a freshman at
orientation, I was truly color-blind, which
is supposedly what we are all to be. I came
from a town in Texas which was mostly
white, with a handful of Hispanics and
blacks. We had no segregation and no
racial tension. After a few months at Pitt, I

. realized that students didn’t even want

racial harmony.

Marcus Gray may have been offended
by Ms. Kendra, but he also proved her
point. Mr. Gray “was raised believing I can
do all things with an extremely Afrocentric
background,” but without that background,
children are “bred an attitude of conformi-
ty.” Sounds like segregation to me. Gray is
in love with his Africana Studies classes,
African cultural center and Afrocentricity.

After centuries of discrimination, our
laws protect all races fully. What more
good can moaning and complaining
achieve besides angering everyone? Gray
tried to pull other racial minoriti_es into the
“fight against inequality” in his article.
However, I have yet to hear of a Latino
Action Society. In a letter to the editor,
Bridget J akub wrote that people should not
be denied the rights to champion pride in
their culture. Until we have a White Action

Society with university funding, true diver-
sity must be a myth. [People] insist on say-
ing African—American, but don’t say
Caucasian-American; they want black pro-
grams and classes, and they certainly favor
affrnnative action. We’ve obviously gone
too far with our “diversity.”

Campus safety improving

On February 6, 1995 an article entitled
“Violence increasing on Campus” was
printed on the “Opinions” page of The Pitt
News  The author, victim of a simple
assault, raises several issues revolving
around this university’s commitment to
student safety which warrant a response.

Pitt has made a major commitment in
tenns of a time, money and energy devoted
to policing the campus. In an area with
over 120 law enforcement agencies, the
University Department of Public Safety is
the third largest police department in
Allegheny County, and operates on an
annual budget in excess of $3,000,000.
The school has invested considerable
expense to make improvements in its
transportation system, campus lighting,
and emergency telephones — all designed
enhance personal security.

The entire university is working hard to
establish programs  to reduce the threat
of crime on campus while promoting safe-
ty  We live in a world where violence has
become all too commonplace, and that is a
reality from which we cannot hide — no
matter where we are the University of
Pittsburgh is taking all reasonable mea-
sures to protect you  from becoming a

victim. If you are victimized, we will do all .

we can to identify those responsible.

One thing we cannot do is to guarantee
an officer will be physically present every-
where you’d like to see one. Vtrrth a total of
132 acres to cover and over 90 buildings,
the officers must keep moving to make
certain the entire campus get coverage. I’m
proud of the care and professionalism rou-
tinely displayed by Pitt police personnel.

Big East -
basketball

returns to ~

its old form

r the
last ﬁve
years or

so, Big East
basketball was
said to be in a
rut. That the
fast-paced,
up-and-down
style of play
the Big East
was known
for has turned into shove—em-
down-your-throat, roughneck
style of basketball.
‘Well, forget it.

as ‘strong as ever. There are cur-

rently three Big East teams in the
top 15. And before Georgetown
went on a four game skid, the
Hoyas were in the top 15, also.

The No. 15 Vrllanova
Wildcats (18-5) are sure to move
up after they beat the No. 9
Syracuse Orangemen (-17-5)
Tuesday night.

Also, the Big East powerhouse

’ Connecticut Huskies (19-1) hold

the top spot in the polls, while
winning 17 consecutive confer-
ence wins, dating back to last
year.

With UConn moving up to
No. 1, it joins the undefeated
Lady Huskies squad (21-0) at
the top spot, where they have
been since they beat Tennessee
Jan. 16. This signifies the first
time teams from the same
schools have occupied the’top
spot in both polls.

The reason for the Big East
boost is the conference possesses
some of the best talent in the
country, like it's had in the past.
The Big East had a rich tradition
of big-time gamers who were
known to take over a game at
any time — players like Patrick
Ewing, Chris Mullin and Derrick
Coleman, to name a few.

Love and a .45

Written and directed by C.M.
Talkington

Starring Gil Bellows, Renee
Zellweger and Rory Cochrane

Something like the clerk,
the thief, his wife and her
trucker, Love and a .45 begins
with a ho|d—up at a conve-
nience store which tells us
everything we need to know
about this latest true romance
caricature. In the beginning,
Bonnie and Clyde begat Sailor
and Lula. Sailor and Lula
begat Clarence and Alabama.
Clarence and Alabama begat
Mickey and Mallory. Mickey
and Mallory begat Watty and
Starlene- who are the natural
born offspring of this on-
screen, white-trashlineage.
Watty (Gil Bellows) and
Starlene (Rene Zellweger)
offer everything we'd expect
from a stylized, talk-talk bang-
bang On the Road; it’s cops

’n’ robbers and other robbers,

hot-rods on hot asphalt,
blown-offheads and lots of
John Woo-style Mexican
stand-offs.

From the get-go, with
Watt-y’s convenience store
heist, it’s Tarantino, Texas. A
cheap movie about movies
about movies, Love and a .45
is a mish-mash of the genre
diet, film intertextuality and
mock filmmaking. Takingas ,
much time to _-parody
Hollywood conventions as to
indulge in them, Talkington’s
loaded camera lifts references
to other cinematic moments
with post-modern, ‘smart-alec
-sensibilities. At times the cam-
era goes noir with Watty’s
existential voice-over rambling
into a dissolve ofthe high-
way‘s yellow-"lines, then it car-

Surfers video “Who was in .my
Room Last Night?”, then wind-
ing up as hyper-noir with lush
rear-projection images. When
Watty purchases film for his
Polaroid at a video_ store,
Talkington acknowledges his
film is little more than a cheap
snap—shot of film history.

The narrative is about as
conventional as stories can
get: Watty teams up with
super-slimey
numero-uno Billy Mack (Rory
Cochrane, see Dazed and
Confused) for another conve-
nience store job. Only Billy

breaks Watty’s cardinal rule, T

A fairly strong anti-drug'state-
ment_prevai|s throughout the
film, and Fonda’s role is prob-
ably the strongest indication 0
such. '
Bearing in mind Talkington’s
method, it would be hard to
disregard Starlene’s invoca-
tion of Warren Beatty and
Faye Dunaway, or, her obser-
vations that they can’t get
caughtbecause “we’re movie
stars.” But, Watty reminds her
their brand of criminals are
always killed in the end.
Equally difficult to disregard
are the direct references to
Reservoir Dogs, ‘a movie’s
movie itself. Once smitten by
Watty, Billy Mack adopts a

T he moment itself is an ironic
reference to Robert ‘Altman’s
Vincent and Theo in that Tim
Roth played Van Gogh. And
what's interesting is that all
three movies were made with-
in the last 10 years, indicating
an on-going dialogue between
contemporary directors and
pointing to the growth of a
post-modern genre.

Like Natural Born Killers,
Talkington’s film presents a
media-fascination with sex
and violence by offering The
Crime Channel (slog-an: “all
crime, all the time”). However,

V Talkington substitutes Stone’s

preaching with a more slap-
stick-‘style parody, -and turns
the Crime Channel into.a run-
ning joke instead of a blunt,
obvious thematic. . A

But, the film does drag at
times and delves into Beavis
and Butthead-style humor.
Obviously, the intertextuality
bit is played to full—tilt which
often becomes little more than

a geeky joke. And for a couple ’

of cartooned lovebirds,
Talkington offers little by way
of on-screen sex, tip-toeing
unnecessarily through Wild at
Heart’s steamy * sass.
Originality lacks, which is the

point, allowing Talkington to ,

What can possibly be worse
than doing something you hate day in
and day out? Wouldn’t it be nice to
vent all of the trivialities which over-
come you and find a way out? Well,
the Church of the Subgenius may be
able to help you. First though you must
embrace Bob. That is, J.R. “Bob”
Dobbs, Jr.

Reverend Ivan Stang, film-
maker, spokesperson for the Church of
the Subgenius and author of the newly
released,Fteve/ation X, "will be making
a stop in Pittsburgh this Friday to hold
a “Deviva|” in order to help all the
unfortunate ‘killing yourself to live’
types get things together and WAKE
UP! Rev. Stang along with other
Subgenius representatives, Father Jo
Mama and the dangerous Dr. Legume,
will be ranting their Subgenulne talk at
the Eye of Horus, a new mystical-type
store on the South Side where, if for
some reason you aren’t quite mesmer-
ized by the Rev. Stang, you can sneak
a peak at the deprivation tank, check
out some great William S. Burroughs
hardbacks, or leaf through ‘a coloring
book of women’s genitalia.

For those of you not familiar
with “Bob,” the spiritual guru of the
Church in the 50s, he first took the
form of the ultimate salesman who
could sell anything. “Bob” is really a
superhuman whose followers share
that certain something which separates
them from the average, run 0’ the

 

    

muck, law-abiding bland normals. The
plastic smile, pipe bearing salesman is
the eternal incarnation of slack.
Perhaps the slackmeister himself or his
ministers may convince you to buy into
his eternal salvation spiel.

“Bob” is willing to guarantee
you, the abnormal misfit that you are
(no normals allowed), a- position as a
Subgenius minister and eternal salva-
tion for the measly price of $30, or O
triple your money back. “Bob” won’t
haunt you, or punish you. This ‘slack’
on “Bob’s” part is one of the nice things
about the Church of the Subgenius.
This religion is different than any other,
as Rev. Stang says, “pew packing”
beliefs. There is no guilt, no commu-
nion, no altar, and no confessing of
your sins. There is only “Bob.” And the
King of Slack does not care about your
sins. He brings to the believers the one
thing that most people want instead of
a confession: an excuse.

“Bob” and the members of the
Church will not accept you if you are
part of the big conspiracy: the conspir-
acy of normal people robbing others
(the less normal) of Slack. And for ‘
those who are still a bit puzzled about
the Texas Death Cult, Slack is some-
thing which you want to obtain. When
you achieve Slack you can live guilt
free and everything you ever wanted
can be yours. Slack is a Subgenius
paradise.

Rev. Stang, “Bob,” and all

join the Devival you’ll be better off if
you don’t wear one of those things that
control time, you know a watch. Rev.
Ivan and the gang are not too crazy
about thesehandcuffs and you can bet
yours may be smashed.

   

members of the Church cordially invite
all those who feel smothered by nor-
mality and emptiness to partake in the
Devival. You can expect to hear the
wise words of “Bob.” and also be pre-
pared to participate in the Church’s

Bettie Serveert
Matador Records/Atlantic

Amsterdam’s fame is
mostly derived from their drug
culture, but slowly sneaking
into the scene is unexpected
Bettie Serveert. Carol van
Dijk’s raspy voice whispers
underneath the autumnal
sounds, like reading Adrienne
Riche’s stream-of-conscious-
ness to serene oceanic
waves.

Their first effort, Pa/omine,
was conventionally described
as a Neil Young and Velocity
Girl offspring, and so this mar-
riage continues. “Kid’s Alright”
and “Tom Boy” were pro-
nounced hit_s, but can their
new album produce the same
instant love?

Lamprey’s “Bay Bay Ftain”
gives Bettie Serveert another
opportunity to top the chart of
alternative radio and MTV’s
120 Minutes.

While lying down on my
bed, hands behind my head,
and staring at a blank white
wall, the song placed several
pleasing images in my head.
Almost like staring at a bunch
of clouds and describing what
they are. I was drawn into
lyrics and her voice as she
sang. Appealing to my lighter
sense of conscience, it kinda
tingled.

On “Crutches” and
“Cybor*D”, Dijk becomes ,the
author of an emotional music
dialogue. Trading feelings and
riffs, the blend is great. ‘

Bettie Serveert is becoming
a marketable tool because
they offer something unique,
like the Velvet Underground
and Nico, with clever lyrics
and music. Taking a distance

Farce: (noun) 1. (an) exag-
gerated comedy based on
broadly humorous situations.

2. an absurd or ridiculous
action, pretense, etc.

In the case of Chemin de
Fer, I hope Pitt Theater choos-

’ es to interpret Websters’ defin-

ition number one, since defini-
tion number two is so much
easier to perform with such a
stretch from their past produc-
tions. Feydeau’s (Hotel
Paradiso) challenging farce is
like nothing modern audiences
are used to. While it has sit-
com shtick for perhaps the



 

raciest period of French histo-
ry, to really understand the
innuendo one has to look hard-
er for it than in a modern pro-
duction of one-liners. -Pitt
Theater has to make this dated
script clear, and make good
use of the physical comedy
this production allows without
making it seem unrealistic.
Chemin de Fer is a turn-of-
the-century story of restless
marriages and, appropriately
enough for‘Valentine’s Day,
games of love. Madame
Chanal (Laura Smiley) has it

all: an ardent lover in Fedot»

a clueless husband. What's a
hot-blooded Frenchwoman to

Obviously, take advantage
of the situation. But when her
once-devoted husband finds
out, all hell breaks loose. The
lives this couple reeks havoc
with are turned upside down.
Lost in themselves, Mme.
Chanal and Fedot do them-

selves in when a rendezvous»

lasts one night too long and is
interrupted by a drunkard with
too good of a memory.

Hold on it hurts
Cornershop
Merge

Eastern sou_nd meets
Western sound and gives
birth toa bastard child by the
name of Cornershop. How

shall I describe a band that
surpasses all descriptions?
Sensational? Yeah, that’ll
work. Cornershop, not only
are they utterly original,
they’re the best!

Their debut album, Holdon
it Hurts, is a sure shot for

:.spring sound. Cornershop is
a perfected male version of
Shonen Knife. If you are not
’a Shonen Knife fan, you'll still
love ‘em. They use a sitar,
for pete’s sake! Their sound
is Americanese millennium
rock with a Japanese animat-
ed flair. Pretty cutesy, huh!

T.-Singh and Ben Ayres
are the lead vocalists, and I
want their phone numbers.
Their provocative voices are
sometimes obscured by their
devastational times 10,
melodic tunes. One of my
favorites is “Skin,” which has
this pleasantly cheesy, late
‘60s sit-com sample frolicking
in the background.

And distortion? Oh yes, "

they’ve got plenty of it.
“Jason Donovan/Tessa
Sanderson” has a few psy-
chical Hendrix riffs and chalk-
*-board scratching distortion.
in “Readers’_Wives,” T. Singh
lazily echoes in with “all our
lives are like Readers’
Wives” (and we all know
what Readers’ Wives are like
— if you don’t know, buy the
album). Although the lyrics

are repetitive, the music will i

have you “trippin' therlight
fantastic.” And that sitar!!! I
want one. "

That quavering sitar is one
of the highlights of the album.
It gives the album a hypnotic,
Eastern flair, especially in the
speedy, go-go, trembling
rawk sound of “Summer Fun
in a Beat Up Datsun” (one of
my personal favorites —
along with all of the other
songs)

In “Trip Easy,” well the
name pretty much says it all.
“Born Disco; Died Heavy
Metal” is a high pitched,
dancey tune, which also
reeks of full-fledged indie
rock and twisty sitar tones.

I haven't been this enthusi-

astic about a band since‘

Gish . I'm going to leave you
with a little hint: the sitar is on
the rise and so is

. Cornershop. I can’t wait to

see their first “buzz c|ip."

But it was second half ball

ended up putting the the

Gant came out in the sec-

were complemented by a

after a BC score, Gant turned
inside for another layup a
minute later, making it 46-
38.

“[Gant] stepped it up
tonight and gave a strong
performance on the offensive
end and on the defensive
end,” Willard said.

On -Pitt’s next possession
Gantwas fouled by Danya
Abrams and in the melee,
Orlando Antigua and Bevan
Thomas received technical
fouls for unsportsmanlike
conduct. Gant knocked down
his two foul shots and Maile
and Marc Moli_nski eachqhit
one of two for the technicals,
making it 49-42._ Gant ended
his run, taking it to the hole
for another two at 12:33.

However, as long as BC
forward Abrams was on the
floor, there was hope for the
struggling Eagles. Abrams
ended up with 27 points and
13 rebounds, but not before
shooting himself in the foot
and sealing the Panthers’

‘ win with a technical foul

with 5:21 left.
The technical led to a 73-

. 57 Pitt advantage and practi-

cally rendered the sopho-
more useless until fouling
outwith 2:54 to go. "~

“We play every game with
confidence,” Abrams said.
“[But] we just didn’t get out
the blocks right away
tonight.”

After the tip-off, Pitt wast-
ed no time pushing BC back
on its heels. After the Eagles
crept out to an 8-7 lead, the
Panthers responded with a
series of three—pointers
which had them up 29-20
and shooting 64 percent (7-
11) from three-point land
with 6:31 left in the first
half. .

Pitt clearly has much more
at stake in this gamethan
Connecticut. As short as five
games ago, the Lady Panthers
were on a roll and thinking
about an NCAA berth, but a
recent rough_ stretch has left
them in a precarious position
at 13-9.. '

“I think that we need 19

NCAA,” he said. “Seventeen

State’s Kerry McCoy.

Last season Penn State and
West Virginia both easily beat
Pitt. This year the Panthers are
expecting a very different out-
come.

“We’re at home this year,”
Stottlemyer said. “I think we’re
very capable of winning both
matches.”

Although unranked this sea-

Pitt and Penn State, is tradition-
ally ranked in the Top 20.

' The reason for these three

schools, as well as other area
colleges such as Edinboro and
Clarion, for being powerhouses.
in collegiate wrestling is the
type of scholastic wrestlers
Pennsylvania turns out.
“There’s a rich tradition that’s
indigenous to this state,”
Stottlemyer said. “The WPIAL

has done a tremendous job“

since ‘84 in producing quality
collegiate wrestlers. A majority
of collegiate All-Americans
come from the WPIAL.”

The answer to the test question

the junior high level.

Many of the members of Pitt, ,

Penn State and West Virginia
were teammates or competitors
at ‘the scholastic level, which
makes a victory all the more
special.

The hatred that shows itself
on the football field doesn’t
really transcend to the wrestling
mat. The rivalry, is strong for
sure, but also very friendly.

The Panthers are hoping for a
strong finish to catapult them
into the Eastern Wrestling
League tournament the first
weekend of March.

A strong finish this year
could set up a 1995-96 season
that might be one of the most
exciting in recent years. With
many sophomores and juniors
returning next season, the
future for Pitt wrestling looks
bright.

scored on a double-pump
from Antigua the next time
down the court. But it was
Antigua who topped off the
Panther run. After sinking a
l0-footer, Antigua stole the
ball back at mid-court and
ignited the near capacity
crowd with a two-handed
dunk in the open court,
boosting the Pitt lead to 35-
22.

Pitt’s scoring streaks,
along with pressure defense,
kept BC out of its game plan
all night.

“The press kept them out
of their rhythm,” Willard
said. “If I look at it now, I
wish I would have pressed a
little more down the
stretch.” _

Willard said he told the
Panther players before the
game they had a six game
season left and they should
make the most of every
game.

“I want these seniors to go
out with their heads held
high, that’s our objective
right now,”'Willard said. “I
want them to know they’ve
helped establish an attitude
in the program.”
