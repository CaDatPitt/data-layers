Pitt blows aaouth Florida

Luc Felakl Senior Staff Photographer

Running back Ray Graham had 268 all—purpose yards last night: 226 rushing yards and 42 receiving yards
on 26 carries and four receptions. Pitt beat South Florida 44-17 Thursday night at Heinz Field.

’ This time when the fourth quarter

came around, the Pitt football team
held on.

In the ﬁrst four games this
season, the Panthers developed
a habit of dropping off in the last
15 minutes, losing leads against
Iowa and Notre Dame and allowing
both Buffalo and Maine to tighten
the scores.

But after scoring two touch-
downs in the third quarter to build
a 34-17 lead against No. 16 South
Florida last night, Pitt added a
touchdown, a ﬁeld goal and forced
two fumbles in the fourthto upset

 
  
  

the previously undefeated Bulls
44'17. .

The win marked the Panthers’
ﬁrst victory over a ranked team
since they defeated then—No. 10
South Florida 26-21 on the road
in 2008.

“We just felt that if we could
come in and execute our offense
 and clean it up, then we could
really score some points and stop
some people,” Pitt quarterback
Tino Sunseri said. “A lot of people
have been talking about how it’s
been coming and we’ve been get-
ting closer and closer, and we ﬁ-
nally did it.” _

It seemed that just in time for
the Big East opener, Pitt found the
ideal game plan: Give the ball to

Public not barred

newspaper

Kelly Lyons
For The PittNews

Pitt’s Collegiate Readership Program
provides quick, easy access for Pitt
undergraduate students to two na-
tional newspapers, both on campus
and online. So easy, in fact, that the
program does not stop non-students
from picking up the papers.

Pitt’s Student Government Board
implemented the Collegiate Reader-
ship Program this past February, and
although the pick-up rate of the news-
papers shows apositive reception, the
open newsstands do not stop passers—
by from picking up the newspaper.

The campus—side subscriptions to
USA Today and The New York Times
cost undergraduate non—College of
General Studies students $30,500 per
year, which comes out of the Student
Activities Fund. Each student pays an
$80 Student Acﬁvities Fee each se-
mester into the fund. The copies of
the Pittsburgh Post—Gazette available
on campus at some dorms are not af-
ﬁliated with the Collegiate Readership
Program.

SGB President Molly Stieber spoke
insupport ofthe Readership'Program
inSeptember2o10 asaboard member,
whenthe Board approvedthe proposal
to bring 300 printed copies each of
USA Today and The New York Times
to campus each business day.

Until recently, a paper stop sign ’

taped on all seven newspaper stands
that distribute the papers informed
people that the copies are only for un-
dergraduate students at Pitt. Thesign

Program’s newspaper stand inPosvar
Hall.

The man, who declined to give his
name, said he was unaware that the
newspapers were onlyfor non—College
of General Studies students at Pitt. ‘ -

“I have been [picking up the news-
papers] for the past three years, and
nobody’sever said anything,” he said.
The manhas been picking up copies of
the Pittsburgh Post— Gazette, but now
he’s adding USA Today and The Times
to the newspapers he picks up from
the stands.

On Tuesday, the stop sign was
missing from a stand in Posvar, but
the signs are still intact in the Litch—
ﬁeld Towers Lobby and the basement
and ground ﬂoors of the William Pitt
Union. -
Stieber acknowledged that this is a
problematic part of the system, but a
solution likely will not come soon.

Stieber said that she will make a
“hard recommendation” for the next
Board to not only continue the pro-
gram, but alsoto install boxes onwhich
students would swipe their Pitt IDs to
receive newspapers. These “swipers”
will be able to tell which undergradu-
ate students are not studying in CGS,
in the same fashion that the ID swip-
ers in residence halls can distinguish
whether or not a student lives in a
speciﬁc building.

Stieber said that it’s important that
boxes are installed, especially in public
places, so other people aren’t taking
advantage of newspapers being paid
for by non-CGS undergraduates. She

Two Pitt students start Tanzanian orphanage

Gideon Bradsaw
For The Pitt News

Jack lives in a one—room shack
with his mother and four siblings.
At 6 years, he is the oldest of the
children. His father is often ab-
sent, only returning home every
nine or 10 months.

Uneducated and unable to
speak any language other than
the tribal language of Masai,

]ack’s mother cannot ﬁnd work.
She gets food wherever she can
to support her family. At night,
the six share one bed.

Months after her visit to Tan-
zania, Pitt student Pooja Patel still
beams as she talks about Jack.

“Jack was one of my favor-
ite kids. He was just incredibly
bright,” she said.

jack is a student .at Green
Hope, the orphanage founded by
Patel and fellow Pitt sophomore
Robert Snyder lastjune in Olgilai
Village, Tanzania. The orphanage
teaches reading and arithmetic to
children like Jack from poor fami-
lies in the village. The students
learn English and Swahili - Tan-
zania’s ofﬁcial languages.

In addition to teaching, the
school provides meals to its 22
students, who range in age from
2 to 6 years.

In mid—May, Snyder and Pa-
tel began volunteering at Last-
ing Bless, an orphanage on the
outskirts of Arusha, a regional
capital in Northeast Tanzania.
Snyder said he found out about
the orphanage through Interna-
tional Volunteer Headquarters,
an organization that pairs vol-
unteers around the world with
nonproﬁt projects in developing
nations.

At Lasting Bless, Snyder, who
majors in philosophy, political
science and economics, and Patel,
a political science and molecular
biology major, met Herieth ja-

at the orphanage with a formal
education.

by the teacher’s energy and the

Pitt sophomore Rob Snyder co—founded Green Hope in Tanzania this

performance level of her students.
The children were performing at
levels comparable to those of stu-
dents in the same grade level in
the United States.

This was no small achieve-
ment, Snyder said. According
to the CIA World Factbook, the
nationwide literacy rate is almost
70 percent; yet among the poor
in Tanzania and in villages like
Olgilai, the rate is lower.

“Unlike the other teachers,
not only did she make her chil-
dren excel, she never once hit or
abused them,” Snyder said. He
said that teachers in Tanzania of-
ten used corporal punishment.

He said that he included an
article in the contract for Green
Hope teachers that forbids them
from striking students.

The idea for Green Hope came
about whenjacobs, 29, told Sny-
der and Patel of her dream to
open her own orphanage. The
team of three found the perfect
location in Olgilai, where Jacobs
lives with her husband and three
young children.

A‘ man named Babu (“grand-
father”) sold Snyder land with a
building on it. Babu spoke only a
tribal dialect, andjacobs’ grand-

 

summer with Pooja Patel.

mother interpreted for them.
Babu signed the land contract
while holding the pen with both
hands.

Green Hope’s classes began
Sept. 5, after the three ﬁxed up
the property. Private donors cur-
rently fund the school, though
Snyder and Patel’s goal is to even-
tually have the school become
self-sustaining.

they expect that the teachers in
Olgilai will be able to manage the
donations coming in and the op-
erations of the school.

Green Hope received full non-

sions'of Pennsylvania Nonproﬁt

enabling it to raise funds more
effectively.

“It’s a long way from a North
Carolina golf course,” she said,
referring to how the trip must
have seemed for Snyder, who
grew up in Raleigh.

Snyder said he had to learn
how to wash laundry by hand
and take showers from buckets.
Traveling the 15 miles between
the village of Olgilai and the more
urbanized Arusha usually tookan
hour and a half on dirt roads that
cut through forest.

One day, Jacobs’ husband
taught Snyder how to ride his
motorcycle so he could explore
on his own. .

“I drove through this little tiny
village, and half the people there

had never seen a white person, ‘

and the other half had never seen
a motorcycle,” he said. “It blew
their mind.” _

Snyder and Patel both said
that they miss their experiences
in Tanzania and care deeply about
improving the prospects for chil-
dren in VTanzania’s lower class.

‘ “Living among and working to
help orphans and street children
opens one’s eyes in a way I’m not
sure I can put intowords,” Sny-
der said.

Counseling Center director
plans outreach, changes

Tiffany Grossi .

For The Pitt News

After the school shooting occurred at Virginia
Tech on April 16, 2007, Tevya Zukor was there
as a staff psychologist to help students cope.
Now he plans to use his ﬁrst-hand experience
with crisis situations to implement changes
at Pitt.

Zukor took over as director at Pitt’s Coun-
seling Center on Sept. 19, succeeding James
Cox, who will now teach ﬁill time in the School
of Social Work. Zukor plans to expand group

therapy services, implement crisis counseling ‘
for students and extend the center’s evening A

hours.

“I consider it quite an honor to be selected
to lead the outstanding group of profession-
als who are already in place and provide the
highest level of service for Pitt’s student body,”
Zukor said. “My ﬁrst week and a half has been

fantastic, and I’ve really enjoyed it. I’ve just-

been getting acclimated to the campus and
getting things set up for the fall semester.”

Zukor said he has been working with the
staff to prepare new fall-semester initiatives.
His staff consists of 10 full—time social work-
ers, psychologists and counselors, as well as
two full—tirne and ﬁve part—time staffers and
ﬁve interns. g

In accordance with the national trend in col-

’ legiate mental health that said group therapy

is highly effective, Zukor plans to expand Pitt’s
group counseling services.’ In group therapy,
six to 10 people meet with-a group therapist,
and the feedback and overall improvement
requires a team effort from each person.

“Group therapy is not only an opportunity
to gain input from psychologists, but also to
connect with other students of similar or dis-
similar issues,” he said. ‘

Stieber wants ID—actiVated
newspaper boxes installed

Newspapers 4 1

Alex Zimmerman, an SGB member, provided
statistics on the number of newspapers bein
picked up. ‘

He said that 98.1 percent of all of the news-
papers deliveredto campus have been picked up
since the program beganinFebruary ofthis year.
Ofthis percentage, 31.47 percent of papers inthe
residence halls are picked up from newsstands.

SGB does not pay for the newspapers that
aren’t picked up. None of the 4,500 copies of
The New York Times delivered to Posvar since
the program’s initiation have been left behind,
and only eight of the 5,034 copies ofUSA Today
have gone unpaid for. ‘

However, the data does not indicate whether
only undergraduate, non- CGS students are pick-
ing up the newspapers.

She would also like to see co-sponsorship take '

place inthe ﬁiture between those already paying
for the program and students in Pitt’s graduate
schools and College of General Studies.

Nicole Rehberg, a senior anthropology ma-
jor, picked up a copy of USA Today in Posvar on
Tuesday. '

“If it’s free, then I ﬁgured I’d pick it up,” Re-
hberg said.

Ian Kenny, a psychology major, picked up a
copy ofThe New York Times from the newspaper
stand in Posvar on Monday.

“I know how much it costs for normal mortals
to buy,” Kenny said.

Aaron Bemer, an undeclared freshman, and
Wesley Davis, ajunior history major, could not in-
clude themselves inthe group of students reading
the newspapers.Davis said that he doesn’t read

USA Today or The New York‘ Times in print.

Bemer said, “I picked one up acouple of days
ago, and I didn’t read it, so I didn’t want to waste
the paper. I can just read it online.”

Zimmerman and Stieber encourage students
to subscribe to an online PDF provided by the
newspapers, nottobeconﬁisedwiththe subscrip-
tion to The New York Times’ website.

Zimmerman said that since students have
to log in to my.pitt.edu to subscribe to the PDF,
which differentiates between non—CGS students
and the rest of the student body.

Stieber said that about 600 students are
signed up for the online replicas of the news-
papers.

V The Readership Program also gives Pitt an
advantage in planning journalistic events. Ifa
journalist from The New York Times is on tour
in the area, Pitt is put to the top of that person’s
priorities. -

Stieber has emailed a number of event ideas
to Kandace Rusnak, coordinator of The New
York Times Readership Program, who will try
to accommodate those ideas.

One journalistic event is guaranteed through
the program per year, and that event has not

happened yet at Pit The New York Times web-

site says that journalists “can appear either in
person or via Internet” through the readership
Program-

Stieberhopes that the new Board, to be elect-
ed in November and inaugurated injanuary, will
continue to implement the Collegiate Readership
Program at Pitt. She said there is “no reason why
we shouldn’t contributetothis.” I °

Zukor < 3

Zukor said that the Counseling Center’s
current group therapy services are good but
that there is a lot of room for them to expand
and become more robust.

The Counseling Center has also extended
evening hours for students until 9 p.m. on
Mondays and Wednesdays. Previously, the
center closed at5 p.m. Zukor said that it hired
a number of part—time, highly skilled clinicians
forthese evening sessions, and it hopes to hire
more in the near future. ‘

' .The outreach aspect of the director’s po-
sition is the part for which Zukor said he is
most excited. He looks forward to talkingwith
students in their classes or in other areas on
campus because the more they know him as
a person and as a licensed psychologist, the
less hesitant they are to stop by the Center

. for services.
One speciﬁc focus of counseling Zukor '
J staff here, and he has a lot of ideas  a lot of

talked about was depression. He said that in-
cidences of the illness have increased in recent
years on college campuses, and he believes that
the condition of the economy has something
to do with it.

“Nothing happens in a vacuum,” he said.
“The economy has been particularly harsh
on the job market, and this leads to higher
stress levels.”

During his session on depression, Zukor
said he does address the issue of failure.

“The idea that everyone gets a trophy
doesn’t help in certain ways,” Zukor said. “It’s
important to stress to students that no one is
going to be perfect at everything that they try.
We need stumbles to make progress.”

“We really appreciate the service and lead-
ership James Cox provided for our students
and staff for many years,” Kathy Humphrey,
vice provost and clean of students, said. “At the
same time, .we’re thrilled to be able to bring
Tevya on board as our new director  He is
going to provide excellent leadership and con-
tinue the ﬁne work for which James and his
staff are known.”

Sharon Young, the Counseling Center’s as-
sociate director, commended Zukor for his
enthusiasm and experience.

“I-think that he is a great addition to the

good suggestions about making some changes
to help us better meet the needs of the students
and just continue providing high-quality ser-
vices,” she said.

Before coming to Pitt, Zukor served as the
director of the Counseling and Psychology
Services Center at the University of Mary Wash-
ington in Fredericksburg, Va., for one year.

He began his tenure at Virginia Tech as a
psychology intern in 2004 and later ﬁnished
his postdoctoral residency in clinical psychol-
08Y- . S

In 1999, Zukor earned a B.A. in psychology
at James Madison University. He earned an
M.A. and a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from
George Mason University in 2002 and 2005.

In addition to beinga member of the Ameri-
can Group Psychotherapy Association, he is
both a certiﬁed group psychotherapist and a
licensed clinical psychologist. '

Thanks to his previous education and work
experience at a number of institutions, Zukor
conﬁdently stated that a student who has any
issue, big or small, causing a disturbance or
interference in his or her life is welcomed at
the Counseling Center for services. I

A Banner Year for Gravity

Our school spirit took a

ground. Although no one was
injured, we at The Pitt News are

cert. We, on the other hand, got
a sign that won’t even stay up.

Computer game demonstrates

 
  

Abdul-Kareem Ahmed

The silence after a stereotype is
challenged is something I haven’t
enjoyed in quite some time.

Stereotypes are easy to apply
— they allow us to compartmen-
talize members of society in a
manner that suits our biases. For
example, when I think comput-
er gamers, I think heavy metal,
Mountain Dew and basements.
And that’s all.

But recently, I discovered how’

terribly ﬂawed my conceptions
were. As reported in Scientif-

ic American magazine, online.

gamers, in playing a competitive
3-D protein folding game called
Foldit, have unlocked the three-
dimensional structure of an en-
zyme involved in HIV infection.
Researchersat the University of
Washington originally released
the game on the Internet hoping

Columnist V

for just such a development.

There’s more room in our
society for the sharing of intel-
ligence and skills. This is proof
that it works.

The enzyme in question was a
protease, which cuts other pro-
teins. HIV infects a host human
cell in an effort to commandeer
it for producing more copies of
itself. Viruses lack the cellular
complexity to replicate without
a host. HIV protease; then, is
necessary for viral progeny —
without cutting a few proteins,
new copies would never reach
potency. .

It follows that drugs that
could block this enzyme would
be of interest to researchers, and
they are. However, they can only
be created when the shape of the
target is well known. To a certain
extent, scientists already know
how to elucidate the structure of
proteins. X-ray crystallography,
nuclear magnetic resonance and

value of public participation

circular dichrolsm spectroscopy

are common techniques that pro- ’

duce starting templates. Refin-
ing these templates is a matter of
computer algorithms. When the
algorithms fall short, however,
human visual intuition can fill
the gap. It did so with the afore-
mentioned protein, resolving a

- problem that had confounded

scientists for a decade.

Tapping a demographic whose
members exercise their visual in-
tuition on a daily basis was both
pure genius and common sense.
It’s genius because it breaks bar-
riers. In the academic world,
specialists are averse to admit-
ting that a “non-specialists” can
do «what they do, or maybe even
more. Now that someone’s done
it, it seems like common sense. .

There are plenty more pro- '

teins with their own implications
for our health that could use a
few keystrokes from gamers.

Economics, cryptanalysis merit general input  

Ahmed< 5

And not just gamers: What other
members of society can contrib-
ute to science? Or perhaps more
broadly, are there people with
other skills that can assist us on
a mass scale?

Economics might be another
such frontier. People both inside

-and outside academic circles are

masters at creating economic
models; some could probably
manage federal ﬁnances better

than Capitol Hill-dwellers. The
New York Times was probably
thinking along these lines when
it released the Budget Puzzle
last November — a simple ex-
ercise wherein users customize
how they’ll balance the budget.
Though it did not lead to legis-
lation, one could easily imagine
a more elaborate, more serious
poll, available to anyone with
Internet access.

Another example of particu-
lar skillsets applied on a mass
scale is cryptanalysis. In 1999,
a murderer deposited two en-
crypted notes beside a body.
When, earlier this year, the FBI
‘s skilled cryptanalysts decided
they couldn’t crack the code by
themselves, the organization dis-
played the notes onits website.
Now, the country’s best code-
crackers are on the case.

Budget balancing and cryp-
tanalysis might be very particu-
lar subjects. But if solutions are
sought for many different prob-
lems on a mass scale using the
power of the Internet, is there
anything to lose? We should make
use of all the availableresources,
and the experts out there that are
simply in hiding.

I can’t help but wonder if

commonsensical and genius
measure we just haven’t yet
identified. Sharing intelligence
across specialities has proven its
use. Lest we forget, it was a doc-

tor, John Gorrie, who invented

the first mechanical refrigera-
tor and the framework for air
conditioning.

SOCCER

Syracuse and Pitt face off  
in future C rivalry game  

Collin Flanagan I Staff Photographer I

Senior Panther midﬁelder Ryan Brode handles the ball against Duquesne. Pitt will face off -with Syracuse

Sean Corrado
Staﬁ” Writer

After Syracuse and Pitt left the Big
East in turmoil last week, the new
Atlantic Coast Conference accept-
ees will ﬁttingly face off on the soc-
cer ﬁeld Saturday night at 7 p.m.

After a 3-1 loss at Rutgers ‘last
Saturday, the Pitt men’s soccer team
begins an important four-game
homestand looking for its ﬁrst Big
East victory. Pitt is now 2-6-1 and
looks to improve its record against
a struggling Syracuse team. I’

The Orange have a very similar
record of 2-6-0, after most recently
losing 2-1 to Binghamton on Tues-
day. Like Pitt, Syracuse dropped its
Big East opener. Marquette took
the Orange down, 3-2, over the
weekend.

Pitt freshman defender Derrick -

Smith started three of the last four

games for Pitt and is excited for the
challenge that Syracuse —— and the
ACC —— willbring.

Smith understands that a win
will come by putting high pressure
on the team’s back line and paying
attention to dangerous Orange play-
ers, such as forward Lars Muller.

“He will require some defensive
attention, just so he doesn’t start

a scoring streak or anything like '

that,” Smith said. “Overall, we will
adjust to whoever appears to be
dangerous on the ﬁeld.”

Despite their respect for Syra-
cuse’s talent, don’t think the Pan-
ther squad is intimidated by them
or the ACC.

“We all are ready to take on the
challenge of playing the top college
teams in the country,” Smith said.

The matchup could not be more
perfect.IBoth teams have just been
accepted into the ACC.; both are

es; both are looking to capture their

"ﬁrst conference wins.

In preparing to face the Orange,
the Panthers plan to showcase their
young talent -— the team members
who will be affected by the confer-
ence shift.

Sophomore Matt Aberegg made
his ﬁrst start in goal this season and
could be back in the net against the
Orange. The 6-foot-4 keeper had

three saves‘ last. weekend against .

Rutgers’ high—scoring attack.
Sophomore Nico Wrobel —— who
has scored ﬁve of the Panthers’ sev-
en goals this season — continued to
demonstrate his value earlier this
week. Wrobel had a strong drive
to score Pitt’s only goal and lead
the Panthers to a 1-0 victory over
crosstown rival Duquesne. ‘

Softball fusing fall
season to prepare

Roger Sepich
Staff Writer

Opening day of their regular
season might be more than
four months away, but the Pitt
women’s softball team is already
preparing for the 2012 season.

With a 3-1 fall season re-
cord after a tournament at
Youngstown State under their
belt, the Panthers will host their
first fall ball tournament ,this
weekend.

“It’s exciting that this will be
the first time we play fall ball

at home,” senior inﬁelder Niki .

Cognigni said. “And it’s even bet-
ter that we get to play some of
our rivals.”

Pitt will host local schools

before taking on Ohio State in

Ryan Samson I For The Pitt
News

Senior Niki Cognigni eyes up a
pitch last season. The Panthers
will host fall games this week.

both games of a doubleheader
Sunday.

“These fall games can give
us some kind of an indication
of what we will have heading
into the spring,” Pitt head coacbu
Holly Aprile said.

The games will be the first
time eight freshmen, including
two pitchers, put on the blue and
gold on their home field at the
Petersen Sports Complex-.

“It’s a really good opportu-
nity to see how the younger play-
ers adjust to this level,” return-
ing junior and starting catcher
Holly Stevens said before the
Youngstown tournament. “We
have a lot of returning talent and».
good freshmen coming in, so I’m
excited to see what we can do.”

The Panthers are coming
off a record breaking season
where they had more wins (34),
Big East wins (13). runs scored
(236), home runs (51), and shut-
outs (14) than ever before. The
Panthers lost some of the ath-
letes that led them to those num-
bers, namely Reba Tutt (all-time
career runs leader at Pitt) and

pitcher Alyssa O’Connell _(set the-

single season win percentage
record at .750). Fortunately, ear-
ly signs are that some.of those
shoes might be ﬁlled.

First—year pitchers Savan-
nah King and Alexa Larkin both- _
picked up wins in the first fall
tournament, against Cleveland
State, Eastern Kentucky and 1UP
and held their opponents to a
combined four runs in the three
games.

B-ut the bats didn't explode "
like Aprile would’ve liked, as Pitt
only managed to score 10 runs
in four games.

“We’re looking to hit the ball
better this weekend, that’s for
sure,” she said. ..

from last season’s 34-17 team,

FOOTBALL

Roger Sepich
Staﬁ Writer

Despite Pitt and West Virginia’s
losses in the biggest games of the
weekend, the Big East fared well

overall. Big East teams won every‘
other game they played, to finish,

with a respectable 5-2 record in
week four of the season.

This weekend marks the begin-
ning of conference play for half of
the league’s eight teams: Pitt beat
South Florida last night, and Rut-
gers travels to Syracuse Saturday.

 \. Here are my rankings of the Big

East teams heading into confer-
ence play:

Pittsburgh — After blowing two
straight fourth quarter leads, the
Panthers rebounded big last night
when they destroyed South Florida
44-17. Before the game, the previ-
ously No. 16 Bulls were the clear-
cut top team in the conference,
but Pitt has to jump them in my
rankings with the way the team
played last night. Ray Graham

r mlooks simply unstoppable —— av- _

eraging nearly 10 yards a touch
and rushing for more than 200
last night. This could just be the
beginning for the Panthers, who
have been trying to adjust to head
coach Todd Graham’s new offense
and might ﬁnally be getting the
system down.

South Florida — Heading into
Pittsburgh last night, the Bulls
were in a position to dominate af-
ter another decisive victory over

UTEP. But the Panthers humbled
quarterback B._]. Daniels and the
rest of the USF offense, which
could only manage 17 points at
Heinz Field last night. This could
be a fluke game for the Bulls, but
their run defense has been ex-
posed and their offense proved to
be stoppable. The Bulls will have
to regroup quick with a road game
against Connecticut around the
corner.

West Virginia - Turnovers and
special teams did in the Mountain-
eers during their Saturday night
primetime 47-21 loss to now-No.
1 LSU. The game was much closer
than the score suggests, as WVU
outgained its opponents with
quarterback Geno Smith throw-
ing for 463 yards against one of
the nation’s best defenses. Head
coach Dana Holgorsen’s team
hosts Bowling Green this weekend
in what should be a tune-up for
their conference opener against
Connecticut next week.

Cincinnati — In their Thursday
night nationally televised game
against NC State, the Bearcats
manhandled the Wolfpack on their
way to a dominating 44-14 victory.
Cincinnati’s offense, led by quar-
terback Zach Collaros and running
back Isaiah Pead, continues to put
up some big numbers as it’s scored
over 40 points in all three of the
team’s wins. It’s crucial that the
Bearcats do n’t have a letdown this
week when they travel to in—state
rival Miami of Ohio.

September 30, 2011 I The Pitt News I WWW.pittnews.com

Syracuse — The Orange continue
to do things the hard way. Despite
picking up their third win of the
season against Toledo in overtime
this week, Syracuse needed some
luck to do it —— the referees gave

~ them credit for an extra point that

was clearly wide. Whether this win
will stand up remains to be seen,
as Toledo is protesting the game.
Nonetheless, this week was just
another example that the Orange
are built to play — and usually win
— close games.

Rutgers — The Scarlet Knights

the Big East is completely strug-

gling this season, it’s hard to say
which is the worst team in the con-
ference. So consider UConn and
Louisville 7A and 7B. The Huskies,
who, like the Panthers, have lost
two close games, returned to win-
ning ways on the road this week-
end at Buffalo. UConn’s defense
completely shutdown Buffalo’s
spread on the way to a 17-3 victory.
A win against Western Michigan
this weekend will be key for the
Huskies’ conﬁdence before they

moved above .500 this week as
they beat previously undefeated
Ohio 38-26 at home. This week’s
trip to Syracuse will say a lot about

_ the quality of both teams, but with

quarterback Chas Dodd and wide,
receiver Mohamed Sanu playing as
well as they are, Rutgers could be
a sleeper team throughout confer-
ence play.

Connecticut — Since no team in

Louisville — Charlie Strong’s
Cardinals surely enjoyed their bye
week after last week’s win against

rival Kentucky. Louisville still has ~

two weeks to wait until its Big East
season begins as the team hosts
Marshall this week before traveling
to North Carolina. A split appears
the most likely outcome and would
have the Cardinals at 3-2 heading

Rutgers — The talented junior pass

yards (176) and touchdowns (2) in
the Scarlet Knights’ win over Ohio.
Rutgers might not have very much

talent or depth at a lot of positions, ,

but the Scarlet Knights deﬁnitely
have one of the best receivers in
the conference. I

Defensive Player of the Week: .

Toledo as he picked off his second
pass of the season on the Rockets’

ﬁrst play of the extra period. Scott.
is one of the best players in a Syra- S

cuse defense that is expected to
make big plays at the end of close
games.

Coach of the Week: Greg Schia-
no, Rutgers — By far the longest
tenured coach in the Big East,
Schiano has made a habit of doing

_ more with less at Rutgers. With the

Scarlet Knights projected by many
to be the worst team in the Big
East this year, Schiano’s team sits
at 2-1 — and don’t be surprised if it
pulls off the upset at Syracuse in its
conference opener this weekend.

“I expect to have a record-

“With the players we have on this
team, I think we can be better
than we’ve ever been.”

Besides using the games to
allow-the freshmen to jell with
the rest of the team, senior third
baseman Kelly Hmiel says every-
one on the team can use fall ball
as an opportunity to learn and
get better.

“This is a chance to see where

look to improve their overall play

tough 3-2 loss to Marquette after
letting up a goal in the 88th min-
ute.

“If we continue to play like that,
the winning will take care of itsel ,”
Syracuse head coach Ian McIntyre

Clark echoed his coach’s conﬁ-

‘.‘It’s just putting the ball in

said after the Orange fell to Mar-

we have.”

This game will begin a stretch of
four consecutive home games for
the Panthers, who will be at home
for six of their next seyen games.

This will be the 18"‘ meeting
between Pitt and Syracuse’s soc-
cer teams. The record is currently

can turn and go.” -

And as Graham went, everyone else
seemed to go, too. Pitt ﬁnished with 523
yards and ran 91 plays.

“We’re improving every game, getting
better every game,” Ray Graham said. “Tino
is feeling more conﬁdent, I’m feeling more
conﬁdent, and they are even feeling more
conﬁdent in this offense now.”

Sunseri looked more comfortable in
the no-huddle offense, completing 22 of 33
passes for 216 yards and one touchdown.
The quarterback got the chance to quiet
his critics.

“N 0 one is a harder critic than my father
 My mom and my dad havelbeen around
football their whole lives at the highest
level,” Sunseri said. “Believe me, I wasn’t

getting anything sugar-coated.”

Head coach Todd Graham said Sunseri
executed the system, looked decisive and
got the ball out quickly — something he’s
struggled with this season.

Sunseri said that he feels more com-
fortable. I

“This was the ﬁrst time I ever ran this
kind of stuff in my life,” he said. “I was
always a drop-back guy. I never had to do
anything post-snap with the reading of the
defensive ends.”

Pitt’s defense held the Bulls scoreless
in the second half.

“We just imposed our will,” Pitt defen-
sive tackle Chas Alecxih said. “I felt for the
ﬁrst time all season that we just clicked on
defense. We were able to do exactly what
we wanted. There was nobody doing their
own thing. We just came together and it
was super exciting.” _

After going into the break with a 20-17
lead, the Panthers increased the lead on
their ﬁrst drive of the third quarter when
Sunseri found tight‘ end Hubie Graham
twice at the end of the drive, ﬁrst for a
pick up of 18 yardsand then for a 12-yard

touchdown. After the extra point, Pitt led
27-17.

“That really set the tone for the rest of
the half  We just said we’re shutting the
door on them,” Alecxih said. “This isn’t
going to be another Notre Dame, another
Iowa.”

And Pitt didn’t stop there. Ray Graham
continued his dominance by breaking free
for a 29-yard run and then adding three
yards to get to the 2—yard line. Zach Brown
ran the ball in for a touchdown to put Pitt
ahead 34-17.

Graham moved more than 200 yards in
the fourth quarter with an 8-yard touch-
down that gave Pitt a 41-17 lead. Harper
added a 46-yard ﬁeld goal to produce the
ﬁnal score.

After right guard Lucas Nix went down
in the ﬁrst half, Pitt redshirt sophomore
Ryan Schlieper entered the game for his
ﬁrst appearance as a Panther.

South Florida took the lead on its ﬁrst
possession of the game on a Daniels rush
into the end zone, but Sunseri answered
soon after to tie the game at 7-7.

The Panthers took a 10-7 lead in the ﬁrst
quarter when Kevin Harper hit a 47-yard
ﬁeld goal. Then on Pitt’s ﬁrst possession of
the second quarter, Harper added a 39-yard
ﬁeld goal to make the score 13-7. 3

The Bulls took their ﬁnal lead of the
game, 14-13, as running back Demetris
Murray found the end zone for a 7—yard
touchdown. Soon after, Sunseri and Gra-
ham led a drive that ended with a Graham
rush into the end zone to put Pitt ahead
20-14.

South Florida drove down the ﬁeld in
the ﬁnal minute of the ﬁrst half, cutting
Pitt’s lead to 20-17 with a 34-yard Maikon
Bonani ﬁeld goal.

“We are winning every day with these
players,” Todd Graham said. “We are de-
veloping something really special, but we
have along way to go.” ﬂ
