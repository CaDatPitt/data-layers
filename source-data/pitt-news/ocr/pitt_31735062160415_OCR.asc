BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
WASHINGTON AP -- The
Watergate crisis escalated Sunday

with congressional talk of impeach- V

ment proceedingsias the House and
Senateprepared to confront Presi-
«-dent Nixon's abrupt ﬁring of
special posecutor Archibald Cox.
The President’s Watergate law-

‘ yer J. Fred Buzhardt, said he was
'-"“—working on a court presentation

that he hopes will gain approval

from the federal judge’ who ordered.

Nixon topsurrender his Watergate
tapes. He predicted the impeach-
ment talk “will pretty much go

iaway” when the public under-

stands what was involved in
Nixon’s decision. ’ .

There" were reports of possible
mass resignations from the Justice
Department following the de-
parture of its two top men and their
eight closest advisers. ' _-

A spokesman for Cox's abolished

’ special prosecution force announ-

ced that the investigating team was
determined to carry on under the
mantle of the Justice Department.
But that resolve remained uncon-

firmed by acting Atty. Gen. Robert .

H. Bork, who is to announce the
future of the Watergate probe

. Tuesday.

Despite calls for impeachment
proceedings by more than 20

,.system of laws,

’ .House members, mostly libe_ral

Democrats.,presidential adviser
Melvin R. Laird predicted ' Con-
gress _would'await the outcome of a
White House ‘compromise ‘ plan.

‘The plan, to provide partial

transcripts. of Watergate’-related

White House tape recordings’

authenticated by a senior senator

was rejected by Coxrbut accepted“ ._ V
at least initially, by the leaders of

the Senate Watergate committee;
Meanwhile AFL-CIO' President
George Meany was reported ready

 to demand the President’s resigna-
tion or impeachment and seek the—
support of his 13.4 million member

unions for a congressional lobbying
campaign. '‘ i .

Sen. Edmund S. Muskie, D-
Maine, said the House should
consider holding impeachment
hearings. “What the President has
done threatens to. destroy our
it smacks of
dictatorship.” Rep. John J. McFall
of California, the House Democra-

tic whip said “ljsuppose we’ll have V

to take .a serious, look at
imp’eachment.”» ‘ .
Sen. Edward Brooke, R-Mass.,
said, “This act on the part of the
President, under the circum-
stances, is sufficient evidence

BY LARRY PANSINO

Robert J. Price, a black City

Council candidate who was top

vote—getter in May's Republican‘

primary, will seek his first elected
political office in November. Price,
a Pitt undergraduate from the West
End, wants to provide the City with
a representative more
with the City’s needs.
“The people are dissatisfied with

Price said. “It has rendered itself

anything. I would like to increase
the input of people ‘into City
government through Council.” i
If elected Price plans to form an
advisory board of private citizens
who could help make their needs
more visible. He feels councilmen
are too remote from their-con-
stituency and should attend neigh-
borhood meetings and talk to
individual citizens regularly.
_“Thc West End hasn't had a
councilman in 30 years and has
been neglected." said Price. “The

When asked why he chose the

Republican Party, Price said‘ after»

surveying the political climate in

progressive black. “TheiDemo-

“We need a competitive second

as a watchdog to the Democrats. I
don't subscribe to the myth that

a position to do something in the
City, they would work for benefit of
black people. too.”

Price 'is optimistic about his
chances of winning in the Novem-

racial and partisian minority status.

Another supposed disadvantage is
his campaign treasury of $1300,
5% of the figure quoted as being
necessary for victory.

Revision of, Pitt Policy

or soon MACLEOD

The‘ Pitt United Farmworkers.

Support Committee (UFWSC) have
altered the University's proposed
policy statement
lettuce andpigrape boycott.

They will submit the statement.

S with their suggested revisions, to

the Chancellor's office sometime
today. '

University officials drafted the
proposal Thursday following a
Wednesday meeting with the
UFWSC and othericoncerned
University citizens. It stated Pitt's
recommitment. “in the interest of
social justice, to the United
Farmworker's boycott."

‘Peace. With Its Citizens’

Viet Amnesty Discussed A

BY BILL HADUCK
“What we need to say to
America is that ,a country that can
make peace, with ‘other countries
ought to be able to make peace with
its own citizens." Henry Schwarz-

child. director of the Project, on V

Amnesty of the American. Civil
Li-berties Union, (ACLU), ex-
pressed ‘these sentiments Saturday
at a working seminar on amnesty.’
Speaking to an audience of about
25, Schwarzchild defined’ amnesty
as “the discretionary’ act of a
sovereign state 'of deciding to
abstain from prosecuting groups of
citizens who may be in conflict with
the law for political reasons.” /

He said pardon and amnesty are
' closely related, but, “Pardon

pertains to a single individual. while
amnesty includes an entire class of
people.” '

BY MARY BETH KENNEDY ,

A dispute between Bobby's of
Oakland and Union National Bank
brought to attention the .former's
check-cashing-policy, initiated in
August. Bobby’s is now cashing
checks for anyone with a student
l.D. with the exception of students
with Union National accounts.

The conflict with Union National
developed when a student with an
accoupt at that bank wrote a. check
to Bobby’s which bounced. Robert
Schall, owner of Bobby's,
quested that Union National hold
the ‘check until more money was
deposited to the ‘account, ‘rather
than process the check a second
time. This I second processing

re. .,

According, to Schwarzchild,
amnesty is not a new idea.
“Seventeen or eighteen presidents
have granted ‘some form of
amnesty after almost every military
conflict in our history." '

The type of amnesty needed for
war resisters of the Vietnam era,
Schwarzchild says, is “universal
and unconditional”. Discrimina-
tion would arise if conditions were
set by “Amnesty Boards”, who
could review each case. “The
articulate people would be better
off than ‘the less articulate.”

Although there has never been a
universal, unconditional amnesty
of the type advocated by the ACLU,
Schwarzchild counters ‘‘We’ve
never had a warlike “Vietnam.”

(This is the second article in a

A series on Landlord Tenant Issues to

be published each Monday in the

 Pitt News.)

Once a,tenant has signed a lease

and begins paying rent to the
.'_landlord.

he is held legally
responsible for all the conditions
speciﬁed in that lease.

But there are other codes of law,
not outlined in the contract, which
protect the tenant from various

 problems which may arise as the
 tenant fulﬁlls the conditions of his

..The Allegheny County Health
Department has developed a code
of laws which provides for

that dwellings are safe. sanitary
and fit for human habitation.

’ The statement of policy of the
rules and regulations declares that
inadequate provision for light and
air. insufficient protection against
ﬁre. unsanitary conditions. im-
proper heating, overcrowding.
dilapidation and ‘disrepair of
dwellings and premises, and the
occupancy of dwellings unﬁt for
human habitation,‘ endanger the
health. safety. morals, welfare and
reasonable confort of the com-
munity.‘ Therefore. the establish-
ment and maintenance of proper

tation of housing are essential to
the public health, safety and
welfare.

Ever have a bad day? “Holy

pate’ those days when you should
stay in bed. Tell me, more. you.

shout. Bernard.Gittleson. repre-
sentative for the Time Pattern
Research Institute. can do that

Tuesday at noon in the Student
Union.

There are three basic bio-rhythm
cycles, the Physical bio-rhythm.
the Sensitivity bio-rhythm, and the
Intellectual bio-rhythm. The three
cycles begin at birth and continue
with precise "regularity throughout
the life of the individual. These
cycles are similar to what has been
called the biological clocks. those
body rhythms which regulate
sleep. heartbeat and respiration.

It is’ hypothesized that the
combination of factors makes one
feel energetic, sharp minded, and
cheerful can be charted. A
bio-rhythm chart looks like the

I

pattern of an oscilloscope. The

‘ different cycles are charted against

the days of the bio-rhythmic year.

I You may be thinking that this is
an interesting fancy. but the truth
is that people are buying it. Safety
experts in this and other countries
are drawing-up charts for their
employees. If employee X is to
have a bad day. he may get a
reminder to be ‘careful. A bus
company in Japan did this and
‘reduced accidents by 50% over a
year.

Bio-rhythm experts report in-
stances where mishaps could have
been predicted. On October .16,
1972, the day Rep. Hale Boggs’
plane crashed in Alaska the pilot of
the aircraft was scheduled for a
critical day. Ted Kennedy had his
Chappaquiddick Island accident on
a double critical day.

Is there something to all of this?
Maybe yes and maybe no. But if

Gittleson at noon tomorrow. ’

according to Schwarzchild.
percent of the people who turned
18 in 1972 didn't bother to register
for the draft. That makes 200.000
or our young men criminals with a
possible five years in a federal
peniteniary and a $10,000 fine."

Another problem Schwarzchild .

says, “is the 465,000 ex-Vietnam
veterans with less than‘ an
honorable discharge. Almost all of
these are by the arbitrary decision
of some officer who says ‘this kid is
a trouble maker, he’s out.’

“Bad discharges victimize peo-
ple for the rest of their lives," said
Schwarzchild. “In addition. well
over half of all military trials
involve absence of obedience.
Charges which don't even exist in
civilian life." 7 '

Schwarzchild said h
quently asked, “What do you as an
amnesty advocate tell the parents
«of one who has died in Vietnam?”
He "feels that question “is properly
addressed to the government, not
the amnesty people. As pathetic as
it sounds, the death was useless.”

. Schwarzchild also contends alter-
nate service is a form of
punishment. “These people have
suffered enough either in exile or in
jail or underground. and who" the
hell can tell me that people ought to
suffer?"

If you qualify for rent with-
holding. your rent is paid into a

special escrow account at Mellon.

Bank until the landlord makes the
necessary repairs. If the required
repairs are not made within a
stipulated time period, the owner
may be prosecuted. _

At the end of six months, if your
accomodation is still unfit, the
money will be returned to you, less
any amount you withdrew to make
necessary repairs yourself.

To find out whether or not you
are eligible for rent withholding,
you must have your house
inspected by either the County
Health Department or the Pitts-
burgh Bureau of Building Inspec-
tors. After, being inspected, the
official inspector will notify- you of
his, decision on the condition of
your housing.

If you are apprehensive about
your eligibility for rent withholding
or possible inspection of your
housing, the Tenant Union has
devised a program called Operation
Homesick, which will assist you in
making a decision concerning your
housing problems.

Operation Homesick has been
established as a'service to those
tenants who do not want to risk

Health Department.

 
 
 
   

‘Members of the Tenant Union
are available 24 hours a day

It should also be noted that if you

once you go into rent withholding,
any lawyer will be able to assist you
in clarifying points of law with the
landlord. .

 Students.for Israeli

Reply to   Socialist Alliance

BY STUDENTS FOR ISRAEL

In the Friday, October 19 issue of
the Pitt News we came across a’
host of adjectives such as “colonia-
list," “racist.” “Elitist'-’ and
“imperialist," ‘all lavishly be-

-. stowed on Israel by representatives
I of the YSA.

Barring outright
cynicism of unprecedented magni-
tude. we find in these exclamations

-a‘sad abuse of socialistic terms.

We shall therefore point out
succinctly what we consider to be a
decisive refutation of the above
claims. We hope that some
socialists will study the problem
more closely and will realize the
utter disanalogy between the case
of Israel on one hand and thoseof
Vietnam,_A_ilgeria, and Rhodesia on
the other. A

Israeli “Colonialism”. The
essence of any colonialism is the-
economic -exploitation'_ of econo-
mically backward societies (“Na-
Itives") by- various offshoots'of

'world capitalism. This feature is

lackingin the case of Israel. Thus
‘Maxime Rodinson, a Marxist critic
of Israel whosex works are well

appreciated by the young socia-,

lists, asserts that ‘‘...It does”not
seem that Israel participates to any
major extent in the system of

exploitation of the third world by -

the industrialized’ world...Israel’s
membership of the western world
is more a matter of political choice
than of economic structure.” More
important, every Israeli Arab will
‘confirm that until 1967 there were
very few Arab workers in the

/Jewish economy. There are more

Arab .workers in Jewish areas
today,’ but they get the’ same
salaries as Jews working on the
same jobs. Last year half a billion
pounds was spent in industrializing
Arab cities taken in the Six Day

\

inefficiently. Duplication of ser-
vices, intense specialization, over-
concentration of‘ man-power and
facilities in a few areas, and
uncontrolled or non-existent price
and quality control standards‘ all
contribute to this inefficiency.
And the inefficiency wastes
valuable time and money. Doctor

bills skyrocket, hospital charges V

increase, and unnecessary oper-
ations are performed in excess of
two million per annum.

_All the while t_he American
people suffer. We are denied
medical services if we live in small
rural areas or if we are unable to
afford the price of hospital care.
Medical insurance ‘coverage is

shared by few, and it is usually’

inadequate. Those of us who are-

-fortunate‘ enough to be able to

afford health care find we spend
more for less as time goes on.
Americans die while waiting for an

ambulance. -Americans die while
waiting for treatment in emergency

rooms. And Americans spend
billions of dollars for unnecessary
appointments, in-patient care, and
medication.

If we are topreserve our health
this must all be changed. The
health related professions and the
insurance companies have not been
able or willing to initiate the
reformshon their own. And it is
time the consumers of this

War in order to create jobs for
Arabs in their own /cities, thereby
minimizing the Israeli dependency
on Arab labor, a potential threat to
the political independence of both
nations.

“Imperialist” Israel and world
capitalism. Israel has very little to
offer to world capitalism. Unlike
the Arab world Israel cannot lure

‘western imperialism by any vast_

resources of raw materials and
cheap labor. Unlike most Arab
states Israel offers no military
bases to any kind of imperialism
(whether western or easternl). In
fact, the oil lobbies and other

-capitalistic interests were often

effective in blocking aid to Israel.

It was the Soviet Union, in 1948,
whoback Israel and procured arms
for her, while the U.S.A. declared
an embargo -and while Britain
saved the ‘Egyptian army from
complete collapse. It is high time
that the young socialists recognize
‘that the identity of that superpower

which happens to back Israelvis '
not a function of capitalism, ..but'

' rather a matter of power balance in
the context of political contingen-
cies. '

Israeli “expansionism” and
“capitalism”. Historically, Israeli

military expansion invariably fol-'

lowed blatant military attempts at
decimating Israel and ' liquidating
her Jewish population. Even our
Arab colleagues admit that this
was, up to 1967, the official line of
propaganda and the seeming
course of action. Syria and Iraq
‘have yet to retract one iota of these
“progressive” ideas while Egypt-

, ian leaders are still explaining to
their masses and chums alike that‘

their recent, more humane tone is
just a matter of “tactic”. ‘

important service be given a voice
in the matter. Our discontent with
the present system must be
vocalized. Our health care needs

must be made known and our‘

suggestions must be integrated
into a new system that would

provide each of us with compre-

hensive health care benefits.
Legislation has been presented

'on "all levels of government

concerning every possible aspect of
theihealth care delivery problem,
So far, only one of the proposed
major reform plans even app-
roaches what this country really
needs.
Known in the

Con gree as

, Kennedy-Griffiths Health Security

Act of 1973, this bill would provide
a total, com,pr_ehensive,.and com-
pulsory system of national health-
insurance. It would “Establish a
system of universal national health
insurance which covers all Ameri-
caps with a comprehensive set of
benefits including preventive medi-
cine, mental and emotional dis-

orders, and complete protection \

against catastrophic costs, andiin
which the rule of free choice for
both provider and consumer is
protected. The program should be

federally financed and federally

administered.” V

Health care is something needed
by every American. We must work
together to promote reconciliation

‘gressmen.

Despite all this the “reaction-
ary" Israeli leaders have offered
time and again (in vain), to trade
their conquests for peace.

To the young socialists, the most
important myth is the claim that

. Israeli military expansion springs

from economic needs. Nothing, in
effect, could be more grotesquely

fallacious. From a capitalistic point ’
of view the Israeli military posture  ,

in the deserted occupied territories
is most wasteful and unproductive;
it arrests significantly both capital
and manpower utilization. Fur-
thermore, to date almost the entire
Israeli industrial structure (owned
mostly by laborers and
government) is located in an area
admitted to be Jewish by the UN in
1947. Capitalism is a matter of
markets, not of areas. Thus Israeli
“capitalism" will stand to gain
everything from a peace which
would open the Arab markets--

even if it operates from a New -

Jersey-sized base.

McDonald's Beauty a Bit Sleepy

BY HARRIS LEVY
SLEEPING BEAUTY
by Ross MacDonald
271 pp. New York:
Knopf ‘ $5.95

Crime doesn’t pay--unless you
write novels about it. Ross
MacDonald (a pseudonym for
Kenneth Millar) the author of
approximately twenty novels re-
cently issued Sleeping Beauty
which, like most of it’s predeces-
sors is a detective novel featuring
Lew Archer. MacDonald, the most
noted living author of detective
novels, has this time turned out a
book which, while not up to some of
his others, is still fast-pacing,
interesting and entertaining.

Sleeping Beauty. like the other
Archer Novels. is set in California.
Lew Archer, a private detective,
meets a very distressed and very
beautiful young woman on a beach
where there has been an oil spill.
Archer takes the girl, a member of
the family owning the oil well, back
to his house where she calls her
husband to pick her up. He refuses
and the woman leaves the house
abruptly. Archer's search for her
uncovers the solution to a murder
committed 25 years ago. He also
meets the woman’s family, a group
of wealthy and outwardly success-
ful people torn by inﬁdelity and the
ruthless use of power. The novel.
which is narrated by the detective
contains several murders and ties
together seemingly unrelated

Alfred "A.

4 events that happenedmany years

apart.
The book, even though it is

engrossing, is hardly -perfect. It is

marred at the beginning by ‘some
surprisingly trashy writing and the
ecological aspects of the case are
introduced in the early part but
merely thrown aside later on as the
book grows increasingly complex.

MacDonald draws a variety of
characters who by and large are
plausible but at least one minor
character is a stereotype. The
conclusion is a triﬂe melodramatic.

5* Beauty aﬂere heat by
oouparieoa with MacDonald's
oﬁer aeveh and the work at other
where. ‘lﬂavorllenotaawell
planned as MaeDonald’a The

Uodergleeld Man (1971) or the
marvelous The Goodbye Look

(1969). In Sleeping Beauty
MacDonald reuses several types of
incidents from his last two novels.
They include murder witnessed in
early childhood and teenagers
running away from home for a
brief, wild spree.

MacDonald suffers from over-
praise. A quote from the New
York Times on the back of the
jacket of the book suggests that
MacDonald is a better novelist than
Dashiell Hammett and Raymond
Chandler. This is simply untrue.
Hammett is the author of books like
The Maltese Falcon (1930) and The
Thin Man (1934) and the creator of
detectives Nick Charles and Sam
Spade. ChandIer’s character Philip
Marlowe was featured in books‘
such as The Big Sleep (1939) and
the recently filmed The Long
Goodbye (1954). These pioneered
the genre of books about cynical,
wise-cracking detectives.

MacDonald's books. which
follow in this tradition, are more
realistic but are far less fascinating
than Hammett’s and Chandler's.
Archer is less tough and cynical
and for this reader is a less
interesting ﬁgure than Spade or
Marlowe. Like Chandler's books
(to which they are more similar)
they are set in California: the
California of beautiful birds and
trees as well as junked cars and
outlandish houses which both
vividly describe.

MacDonald is good. but to this

reader not quite as good as
Hammett or Chandler. He is
however probably the only Ameri-
can detective novel writer who
deserves to be discussed with his
great predecessors. And like
theirs. his novels should not be
relegated only to readers of genre
books for they are worthy of serious
considerations by the general
public.

crises in America, “It's Enough to

I can evaluate my success in obtaining a

I can identify with many.of the spe-

offer to us. .

As Homecoming Queen, I would try
to better understand the students and
their ideas. But, most of all I would try
to generate enthusiasm for life which
leads to involvement, both in the Uni-
versity and community settings.

Can a Homecoming Queen contri-
bute anything tangible to the University,
to other students, or the community?
Probably not. What she may contribute
is something intangible. She can, in
some measure, represent the spirit of
the institution and it's students. She can,
through the way in which she lives, rep-
resent the values of integrity and dignity.
If she is fully aware of her responsibil-
ities as a representative of the University
community and the students, she may
well make herself a better and more re-
sponsible person. If e|ected~Homecom-
ing Queen, I would hope to hold the

position in a way that would bring cred-

it to the University.

My perception of a Homecoming
Queen is one who is a representative of
the entire student body. In a University
the size and diversity of Pitt, this has; be-
comes extremely difficult. However,.this
role provides one the opportunity to ad-
dress a major problem of the student
popu|ation—apathy. Pitt has a wide
range of students. I feel involvement is
essential for ones personal growth. I
have found the more involved I am, the
more I have gained. One of my primary
goals as Homecoming Queen would be
to foster more interest among students

. in the University community.

I feel that as Pitt's 1973 Homecoming
Queen, I would try to carry on the image
in a traditional manner, but I would also
like to bring to the students and the
community the idea that a Homecoming
Queen can be an aware and caring hu-
man being. She does not have to be the
’-'cute," sterotyped coed who has but lit-

' tle intelligence, and cares about noth-
ing but hair-‘styles, make-up and cloth-
ing. As Homecoming Queen I would
like to be a true representative.of the
women of the University of Pittsburgh.

Being chosen Homecoming Queen
would be a great horfor, for I would be
representing the entire University of
Pittsburgh. As a representative I would
present several qualities the University
life fosters-namely as independent, re-
liable person questioning the impossible
and searching for new knowledge. To
the students I would contribute time-—
time to listen to their problems and to
help them if possible. I would give to
the community a smile or a little ’'hello’’
to let them know they are important.
And to myself I would gain more self-
confidence and poise resulting fr‘om so-
cial interaction.

As a commuter I could serve as an
example to other commuters._By being
active in student events I could show
them that the University belongs to
them and that they-will miss a great part
of their education by not becoming in-
volved in the University. The University
holds much more in terms of friendship
and activities than many commuters ex-
perience.

My friends in the dorms could help
me better relations between dormers
and commuters. This way, both groups
will experience more in terms of views
others and friendships.

In the role of Homecoming Queen, a

qualified woman experiences much in- '

volvement with people, and a lot of spir-
it and energy is needed in such a posi-
tion. I feel confident that I will be able
to contribute to this role.

As a member of sorority I know how
important and necessary interpersonal
and intergroup communications can be,
therefore, as a representative of the
whole University, I hope to spread
greater meaning between the Universi-
ty, the student body, and the surround-
ing campus community.

As a student in SGS, I feel that I am a
needed representative to act as Liaison
between evening and day students. I
feel I could make many of the people in
SGS, through my University activities,
become more a part of life at Pitt.

It has been my experience that the
average night student finds it difficult to
relate‘ to Pitt's general «atmosphere.
Leading a diverse life, working by day,
studying by night, the students tend to
remain out of the main stream of Uni-
versity activity.

Pitt gives me the opportunity to en-
joy the benefits of academic and person-
al growth.

of working commitments during the
day, General Studies students are seldom-

able to participate in activities asso- w

ciated with college life. Being elected

contribution to the University of Pitts-
burgh would be a twofold by bringing a _'
new identity to the evening students
and making the University community
more aware of these students who pur‘-..

ple around me is the best way to under-
stand myself, my school, and its com-

is not just for good times. I want to know

The key to spirit and devotion in the’
University is enthusiasm. In a time when
it is fashionable to be negative and apa-
thetic, I believe that an enthusiastic
voice like mine is needed to lead the
student body to a greater pride and de-
votion. Through my activities in sorority,
pre-med, and as presidentof CWENS, I
am an active member of the University
community. Stephen 5. Wise once said,
”An unshared life is not living.” By fol-
lowing this idea, I as a woman would

and enthusiasm with the student body P355l"8 "W attitude on to the many 5351973 Homecoming Queen. 10:00 a_m_ _ 7:00 P.m__

The most that anyone can contribute
in any given situation is one’s' total self.
When'I came to Pitt, I had,two paths
from which to choose, I could have sat
back and watched the world go by or
become involved in a few of the many"
organizations Pitt has to offer. Because I
feel that college should prepare one for
life, not only through books,. but
through everyday living situations, I
choose the latter path. The responsixil-
-ity of Homecoming Queen would give
me more of a chance to carry out this
hope.by allowing me to come in con-
tact with many new people and situa-

our interaction, I can successfully convey
the goals and objectives of the Univer-
sity to the surrounding Pittsburgh com-
munity. I also believe I can participate in
television‘ and radio interviews and pro-
ject a viable positive impression of the
University.

I feel I can further the working re-
lationship between the University com-
munity and the responsible working
people. As Homecoming Queen, my ef-
fectiveness in dealing with the commun-
ity would be vastly enhanced.

I believe that the major contribution
I could make to the University commun-

be the time and conscientious effort re-
quired to represent the University in the
best possible way. I do not ’’collect’’ ac-
tivities; instead I take pride in careful
selection of meaningful responsibilities
and in the devotion of all necessary time
and effort. I see the title of Homecom-
ing Queen, as, of course, an envious
position warranting an enormous
amount of pride, but also as a serious
responsibility that I would be careful to
.fulfill.

Contribution by one person to the
University atmosphere and community-
.of Pittsburgh is small, but to the individ-
ual it is a part of growing and fulfilling
other lives. Being in General Studies has
not only enlightened by ducation
through books, but also through inter-
action with the student found there. The
students are unique by their experiences
in designated occupations and their in-
terpretation of education. Through my

_ experience as both a day time and night

BY BART MACK A
ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR

The pregame indications called for a battle of the running backs here
at Chestnut Hill, Mass. Butso far, the highly touted offense that
Boston College boasts has yet to come off as anything even
approaching the Pitt JV’s. The second half has just begun and it has
been Pitt all the way, taking a 21-7 lead into the locker room at the half.

In fact, the score could very ‘well have been 28-0. The Eagles broke
onto the scoreboard only through a “ﬂea-ﬂicker” that saw" BC
quarterback Gary Marangi throw a pass behind the line of scrimmage

  Eagle—Eye

to split end Dave Zumbach, who suprised the Pitt secondary by lobbing —
the ball downﬁeld. The play carried to the Pitt one and the Eagles -

easily put the ball over. _
The match to decide the most improved team in the East has shaped
up so far so nothing more than a display of the Pitt Panthers offensive

and defensive capabilties. With the third quarter almost half over it .

seems that the days of inconsistency are over for the Panthers. Johnny
Majors has certainly made that obvious, but then again, Pitt fans could
get their ﬁrst view of it next week. “‘\> .

, The Cats are at their best on the road. The record to date proves
that. The question is, can Majors have his boys ready for the next
home game, or is the pressure playing at home too much for the Pitt
players to handle? - ' ' ,

For the Cats to come out with such an impressive overall display

against a Boston College team that was rated highly, following close A

defeats at the hands of Tulane and'Miami, is certainly something to
behold. To watch Pitt runthe ball up and down the field, completely
dominating the game, withoutthe cheers and support of the home
crowd, one has to wonder why they haven't put on such a show at Pitt
Stadium. « ' I V
Of course Tulane and Baylor can be. considered better teams than
Boston College--at least from this reporters view of all three teams.
Their showing against Boston College obviously indicates that the
Panthers have jelled into a ballclub that can be relied upon for results
in the performance department. What they didn’t do against Baylor

they have done today. What they did do against Tulane, they didn’t do T

today. _ A X -

The battle of Mike Esposito versus Tony Dorsett never really
developed, Dorsett is enough alone to make Pitt a power, or at least a
team not to be taken lightly in the next four years. That Bill Daniels
has shown today that he is a leader and can carry the Panthers through
the rough times. _

Majors said that Boston College was one or two touchdowns better
on their home field. Well, that rational seems to be reversed. It is Pitt

"that has" taken the liking to playing on its opponents gridirons.

With the play now in the final quarter, the score Pitt 28, BC 7, the
Panthers are on their way to winning the most important game in the
last four or five years. If what Majors predicted turns to be true, the
win against West Virginia followed by a trouncing of Boston College
should mark the turning point. ' -

The Panthers now ha_ve only to live up to their own credentials,
‘which they have'displayed’on four occasions so far this season.

The pressure of playing at home shouldn't be so great next week,

With a pair of back to back win and a rather easy opponent in Navy_,,

there should be no reason for a sub-par performance. If Boston College

was the toughest test for Pitt, then a repeat performance will roll ‘next _

Saturday - at Pitt Stadium. ,

Chestnut Hill, Mass.--A methodi-
cal Pitt Panther football squad went
a long way in showing they are for

highly touted Boston College team

Really, the 14 point spread was no

were more outclassed on the stat‘

the game was billed as a showdown

of the East’s most improved teams. ,

Johnny Majors, who had referr-
ed to the game as the “crossroads_"
for both teams, now finds his team
with a chance to register the first

As it stands now, the Panther's

3-2-1 record‘ is the best since they

were 5-1 under Carl DePasqua in
1970, '

quarterback Bill Daniels, the Cats’

Chestnut ‘ Hill, Mass.--In the
tiny, steam-ﬁlled locker room here
following Pitt's 28-14 thrashing of
Boston College, the excitement of
the players was quite evident.
Among the many cheers that were
heard after the game, the most
repeated one was, “We're number
two in the East."

The Panthers knew that the
winner of this‘ game would hold
that title. Boston College had‘ been
ranked second,‘behind Penn State,
in Sports Illustrated, and it seems’
obvious that Pitt will move into that

‘ second slot.

“There's no doubt in my mind
that we're number two in -.the
East." said Cat guard Ray Olsen.

“We just have to keep working to . ’

get that number one spot.”

‘Monster Back Mike Bulino, a
mile long grin plastered on his face
said, “I think we're number one in
the-East and it feels great.“

A bit more mundane was
Panther quarterback Billy Daniels,
who ran for 71 yards and scored
two touchdowns, in addition. to
completing nine of 14 passes. “We

can’t say. we’re number two.«"

Boston College was and ‘we beat

Pitt head coach Johnny Majors

echoed Daniels’ sentiments about

the Navy game. but is not hesitant
about saying that Pitt is number
two. ,
“This game was a challenge to
see who really is number two.‘ The

‘real number two stepped to the

front."
Majors will not be satisfied with

‘ being second though. “We’ve got

"to work to be number one, butyou
can’t be number one until you’re a

“Our” team will not be over-

conﬁdent if it listens to its head

:In a game that “saw the starters

_as.:'1,the subs. and maybe slightly

the‘ Pitt booters registered their
thirdpshutout of the season against
the Point Park Pioneers by a score
570. ' I ,

';It's a shame that Coach Bemis
wasn't on hand to see John Morhan
have possibly his best game in a
Panther uniform picking up an
u'n,assisted— goal plus-assisting on
_t_wo_ other ones.

“I think that one of thereasons I
played so well was that I was
dropped from the starting lineup
before this game." said Morhan
afterhthe game. Bemis might even
reinstate him next week after that.
‘.".The Panthers came out charging
hard .and applying a lot of pressure

/

.. the Pioneers could rarely get the
A ball out of their own zone. The
Cats had a few early scoring
opportunities but couldn’t cash in.
"With ﬁfteen minutes gone in the
opening period, Joe Luxbacher
raced to meet the ball in front of the
net but could only get off a weak
hjgead shot that found its way into
he goalie‘s hands.

dropping the ball off to Morhan.
Morhan then passed the ball to
John Curley who dribbled around

the goalie and shot only to have his

shot blocked by a defenseman. but
Luxbacher picked up the blocked
shot and,put it into the net. giving
Pitt as much of a lead as it was
going to need all afternoon.

It was only a few seconds later
that John Morhan picked up the
ball on the left hand corner of the
field and passed it to a waiting

net to account for the hooters

Panthers had more opportunities in

The Pioneers had given the Cats
a corner kick and John Curley was-

chosen’ to put the ball into play.
Curley shot a beautiful lob right in
front of the net, but none of the
Panthers could reach it and the
Point Park goalie had only to wait
for the ball to drop into his hands.
If it seems like the Pioneers
weren’t ‘doing anything during the
opening half, it's true. The only
evidence that‘ the Point Park
players were even onthe ﬁeld were

. came out charging, putting pres-

sure on the Pitt defenders. Steve
Risak of Point Park got around the
Cats’ defense and shot, only to be
thwarted by a save by Bill Haines.
Haines stopped another Pioneer
rush minutes later.

Tim Tremont then got in
between Haines and Risak to stop a

potential Pioneer score and had to

repeat that performance again as
Risak continued to pour on the
pressure. . -
The game seemed to seesaw
after that with Pitt mounting
pressure. and Point Park coming
right back with an occasional rush
on the Panther net. With all the

‘pressure that both teams were"

exerting on one another, neither
team could put the ball into the
opponents net "for a score.

It was then that the subs came in
off of the Pitt bench and John
Morhan this time took charge of the
corner kick. His kick found its way
in front of the net with Joe
Luxbacher heading the ball. John
Curley picked off the Luxbacher
head pass and put it in the Point
Park goal for his second score of
the afternoon. This marked the
first time that the hooters have
been able to score from the corner
kick all season. _' .-

handed their University of Pitts-

loss ofthe current campaign in a
contest that is vital in_ both football
programs.

.Greg McCray was Pitt's biggest
weapon of the day as he returned
four West Virginia kick~offs for a’
total of 218 yards. The Chicago
specialist took the opening kick-off
on his 7 yard marker and danced 90

yards behind a pair of key blocks

only to be pulled down 7 yards from
the score.

Pitt's offense wilted when ‘two
dives. a tailback sweep. and an
incompletepass w-as unable to

Coach Jim Youngblood's defense
indicated that it was going to be a
long day for the Panther Cubs,
which it certainly turned out to be-

Little Mountaineers began their
second scoring drive that required

Pitt's one yard line. Hardy dived
for the score and the conversion
was’ good.

' The contest was plagued by 12
fumbles, eight for the Mountain-
eers and four to the junior

Panthers. Only a pair of fumbles
were caused by hard tackles, the
remaining ten fumbles appeared to
be the result of a lack of execution
and poor cohesive play.

(tops Series

-OAKLAND AP -- The much

maligned Oakland A's--a team that

always seems on the verge of
splitting at the seams with

dissension, pulled itself together
‘Sunday long enough to erase the

last remnants of the “Mets'
Miracle" beating New York 5-2 in
the seventh and decisive World
Series game. ~

The heroes were Bert Camp-l

anoris and Reggie Jackson who
ended a week of power drought and
frustration for the A’s by ripping’ a
pair of two run homers in the third
inning that triggered‘ the vic-tory.
Afterwards the celebration both
on and off the Oakland Coliseum
ﬁeld was interrupted by the
expected negative note that

-seemed to surround this team at all

times.

Dick Williams formalized the.

worst kept secret of the Series, his
resignation as manager of the club.

It was.a resignation he had told.
his, players in the: midst of the

'~Serie_s that he would. deliver to A’s
« owner Charles 0. Finley at the end

of it-.-“win or lose."
Williams said he was leaving the
A’s- because of family considera-

tions “and personal considerations‘
that have no reflection on — the

Oakland A’s and that I’ think I don't
have to discuss. _ ‘ ' j ‘
Losing their manager was a final

ironic twist for the world champion ‘

A’s, who survived all kinds of
problems on their way to the title.
