Gibbs goes f, Pitt wins lirstame 21

Senior guard leads P
team with 22 points

R] Sepich
Stajfwriter

Late in the ﬁrst half of Wednes-
day night’s game, Ashton Gibbs

decided that he’d had enough.

With the men’s basketball team
up just six points against Provi-
dence, the senior guard and Big
East Preseason Player of the Year

. took over the game by ﬁnally do-

ing what he does best: He started
making shots. « V

Gibbs drained five straight
shots on consecutive "possessions
— including four 3—pointers — to
blow the game open and" help end
Pitt’s eight-game losing streak as
the Panthers (12-9, 1-7 Big East)
defeated the Friars (12-9, 1-7 Big
East) by a score of_86-74 at the
Petersen Events Center.

The victory marks Pitt’s ﬁrst
win sincethe team defeated St.
Francis in December. With the
win, the Panthers avoided a ﬁve-
game home losing streak at the
Pete — what would have been the
longest in the building’s history.
It’s also the Panthers’ ﬁrst Big East
win since last March.

Gibbs, who ﬁnished with a
team—high 22 points, wasn’t the
only Pitt player making shots.

The Panthers ﬁnished the con-
test shooting 49.2 percent from
the ﬁeld, their-best percentage
since their last victory more than
a month ago. A

“We got some good shots early,
got in a rhythm and got some con-
ﬁdence,” head coach Jamie Dixon
said in a post-game press confer-
ence.

Senate

‘By Pat McAteer
For The Pitt News

Students might have to make men-

tal notes to bring their college IDs V

or licenses to the voting polls with
them if Pennsylvania House Bill

- 934 gets passed.

The bill, sponsored by state
Rep. Daryl Metcalfe, R-Butler
County, requires that all voters
provide a valid government-issued
photo ID — from either the state or

’ federal government —— before they

vote at the polls. The language of
the bill has recently been changed
to permit college IDs as an accept-
able form of identiﬁcation.‘

The bi1l’s critics say its terms
have the potential to disenfran-
chise historically marginalized
voting groups, but its support-
ers think it could decrease voting
fraud. '

The bill is an amendment to the
current Pennsylvania Elections
Code, created in 1937, which es-
tablished standards such as dates
and procedures for elections in the
state, but doesn’t currently require
Pennsylvania voters to show ID at

the polls unless they are ﬁrst-time.‘

voters.

The House passed Bill 934 in
June, and it currently sits in the
Senate Appropriations Committee.
Once the committee amends the
bill, the Senate will vote on it. If
the bill passes in the Senate, Gov.
Tom Corbett must sign it in order
for it tobecome a law.

The bill was proposed in the
House over the summer, and its

House Bill > 4

By Amy Friedenberger
Contributing Editor -

Whenjeffrey Shucosky was a soph-
omore, he would sleep from 5:30
p.m. to 2 a.m. because he had to host
a radio show on WPTS during the
dreaded late—night time slot.

He’d make the walk into the si-
lent William Pitt Union, bypass the

early—morning cleaning crew and

play some jams from the deserted
studio for anyone who happened
to still be awake between 2 and 4

' a.m.

“Occasionally, I’d have to wake
up the security guard to let me back
in,” the current senior said about
his predawn dorm return. “I think
she wondered where I went for
those two hours.”

Nate Hanson, the station man-
agerfor 92.1 WPTS—FM, a24/7 non-
commercial station owned by Pitt
and funded through the Student
Activities Fund, referred to those
time slots as “a rite of passage.”

Some traditions never
change.

But this year, WPTS, composed
of roughly 100 staff members,
decided to “go against the status
quo,” as Hanson called it, adding
a host of new components to the
radio, including a variety of new
programming and projects, such
as a magazine.

When WPTS formed at Pitt in
1957, 12 students made up the staff
of the radio, which was on the AM
dial and only reached students in
the William Pitt Union and nearby
dormitories. Since its inception 55
years ago, the students who make
up WPTS have transformed the

station into one that engages all of .

Pitt’s campus.

Pitt alumnus Adrian Cronauer, a
former U.S. Air Force sergeant and
radio personality, spearheaded the
creation of WPTS. Cronauer would
later serve as the inspiration for
Robin Williams’ character in the
1987 ﬁlm “Good Morning, Viet-
nam.” Williams plays Cronauer,
who arrives in Saigon to DJ for
the Armed Forces Radio Service.

Cronauer gained popularity for his
humorously witty shows. ‘

just as Williams’ ‘character
challenged the strict guidelines for
music selection he was expected
to follow, WPTS has similarly been
challenging the mainstream music
scene. ‘

“We’ve been on air for avery long
time,” said Hanson, who puts in any-
where from 30 to 35 hours a week
at the radio. “We are specialized in
progressive programming.” "-

Expanding on progressive
radio

The term “progressive” is one .

that Hanson believes encapsulates
WPTS.

“Essentially, anything you hear
on WPTS is going to be progres-
sive,” Hanson said. “Really what
that means is that it’s cutting edge,
fresh, something’you;can’t get any-
where else on an FM dial.”

In order to produce the station’s
wide variety of progr_amming, each
WPTS staff member is required to
put in two staffhours a week. Tasks
for the hours can range from re-

viewing CDs to participating in “The ,

Morning Show” from 7 to 9 a.m.
Students can play music from
the automator, CDs, records, iPods
or personal collections. The station
houses more than 10,000 CDs and

Januaryii 26;  1 The‘ Pitt News a wWW.pittneWs:com

"receives about 50 new ones each

week from musicians looking to get
air time. ‘

To get their shows out to listen-
ers, the WPTS staff members use an
auto mator system and streaming
options on their recently revamped
website. A turn of the radio dial to

92.1 FM brings WPTS’s progressive ‘

music to the public.

But Hanson didn’t want the radio V

to just stick to music. ,
WPTS launched a new website

that includes podcasts and displays .

shows that go on the air. New shows
include “Ex Post Facto,” a discussion
about political happenings; “Earth-
lings Talking Earth Things,” a show

about environmental issues; “The ~

Pitt News on WPT_S,” on which the
newspaper’s staff members host
discussions about news issues; and
“The Oakland Zoo Show,” an im-
mersion into the Oakland Zoo that
serves as a pregame show.

“One of my biggest initiatives
was reaching out to different stu-
dent organizations and having

_a greater presence on campus,”

Hanson said.

Dan Scullin, the radio’s program '

director, approves what goes onthe
air. A new show he approved is the
“Super Slot,” which gives D]s an
hour to play whatever they want, but

Amlmny Gimn I ‘-ax.-1ll'li’l1<.:1.n;x' ‘aplltw

» ~ l‘ilLI:.--. lm ~'1‘;aI’n V“

with the hopes that the material be
“radically unique.” In the past, “Su-
per Slot,” which airs on Wednesdays
at‘10 p.m., has featured yodeling
cowboys and grindcore —— music
that draws inspiration from genres
such as death metal and industrial
music.

.“I’m excited about this year be-
cause I think we can really leave our
own ﬁngerprints on WPTS,” Scullin
said. ‘ l

was spurred by his examining other
professional media and ﬁnding that
radio broadcasting didn’t need to
keep the staff locked  in a studio
all day. .

So when he hired managers,‘ he‘

looked for the same innovation and
creativity that he had at the back of
his mind. The staff set up a projects
board, and one idea that emerged
wasthe creation of a magazine.

The 19—page_magazine booklet
included stories about the impor-
tance of progressive broadcasting.

And on March’12,immediately
after students arrive back on carn-
pus from spring break,.WPTS will
host the group No‘ Age for a spring
concert.

The radio staff members also

the partnership, WPTS staffers con-
tribute stories to the Magazine and
Weekender sections of the paper on
Tuesdays and Thursdays, respec-
tively, and Pitt News writers and
editors take part in the weekly news
show on the radio.

“It’s_ given us a lot of opportu-
nities we wouldn’t have had oth-
erwise,” said Michael Macagnone,

' the editor—in-chief of The Pitt News.

He noted that allowing writers to

Byjoe Chilson
Staﬁ Writer

On Tuesday night, fraternity members from
Phi Kappa Theta and Delta Phi and soror-
ity sisters from Delta Phi Epsilon met at a
fraternity house for dance practice. A
After an hour of jumping, stepping and
twirling, the group had gotten down about
one minute of a 10-minute dance routine.

E The 20 Pitt students have not embarked
on a three—month-long practice regimen for
fun. Instead, they will commit their dance
routine to memory by March 30 to compete

in Pitt’s annual Greek Sing performance and '

competition at the Fitzgerald Field House,
where§11 teams of fraternities and sororities
will bust their moves for charity.

“If you’re in Greek Life and you can dance,
you’re in Greek Sing,” said Hannah Urick,
Delta Phi Epsilon’s Greek Sing chair-.

Last year, Pitt’s Greek Life completed
its ﬁve—year goal to raise $500,000 for the
University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute.
The students’ new goal isto raise $300,000
in three years for the Cystic Fibrosis Foun-

. dation. ' - .
Urick said that all proceeds from-the sale
_ of Greek Sing tickets, which will most likely

_ I, remain priced at. $10 each, will go toward _ ’
 {the charity.

To put on a show like Greek Sing —— in
which participants compete for titles like
best costume, best set and ﬁrst, second and
third placesfoverall — takes some coordi-

G , nation.

Each of the 11 sororities on campus is
paired up with one or more fraternities,
depending onthe size of the fraternities.

The teams then have three months to
create a 10 -minute choreographed song and

dance routine set to a theme, complete with p

vocal solos‘, sets andcostumes. T

Urick said that most fraternity and soror-

ity teams practice two times a week inJanu—
ary, three times a week in February and four
or ﬁve times a week after spring break.

‘Their hardwork breeds ﬁerce competi-
tion. Each team brainstorms a theme for its
routine and keeps.it a well-guarded. secret
for as"lo‘ng as possible. ‘

 7 _In "fact, Ian=M‘eGrath, Greek Week chair ‘
for Phi Kappa Theta, said that only 10 people

in his fraternity even know whatits theme
is. ‘

But Urick said. that the ideas don’t stay se-
cret forever. “We’ll know probably in March
what other people are doing because people
start blabbing,” Urick said.

When it comes to talent, every team de-'

cides differently how to select performers.

Some host tryouts for dance positions, while ’

others take anyone they can.

  

Ryan ‘—i-a.r.n=um

McGrath said that he promised his part-
ners in Delta Phi Epsilon that he would get
one brother, who happens to be a talented
gymnast, to do a few ﬂips on stage come
showtime.‘

But contributing is about more than just
athletic ability. “We have ‘Builder Joe,’ he’ll
just build a bunch of stuff,” the sophomore
said. “We have another kid who’s a studio
artist, so he’ll paint too.” ~

For Rob Kiernan, a junior in the Delta Phi
fraternity, Greek Sing is an opportunity for
campus involvement.

“It’s just another way to get involved with
campus in general. I mean, that’s a big reason
to join a Greek organization, to get more
involved on campus, and this is one of the
biggest ‘Greek-only’ things that they do,”
he said.  '

state college students might not have Penn-

about college IDs' being anacceptable form

The "legislature amendedthe bill, and it

Frankel said that the bill is simply an

ity IDs at the polls. .

Across the United’ States, bills similar
to House Bill 934 have risen in prominence
in response to perceived increases in voter
fraud. The U.S. Department of Justice re-
cently overruled a bill requiring voters to
present photographic identiﬁcation cards
in South Carolina, saying that the law would
make voting more difficult for minority vot-

ing groups. F

Krieger said that the U.S. Department of
Justice’s ruling on the South Carolina voter
identiﬁcation bill was “aggressive” and add-
ed that he did not know anyone who did not
own some form of photo identiﬁcation.

The bill also received criticism from pri-
vate organizations not associated with the
Pennsylvania State -Legislature. . 4

Andy Hoover, legislative director of the
American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylva-
nia, said that Republicans in the state House

I were using “urban legends” to make their

case for rampant voter fraud in the state.
“There is bipartisan opposition to the bill
in the state Congress,” Hoover said. “Legis-
lators know that they are all responsible in
allowing citizens to vote.”
Hoover said that voter fraud in the state
of Pennsylvania is extremely rare, and added

that in states with similar voter identiﬁca-
- tion laws, on average, the cost to the state

is increased by 50 percent. .

He also said that unlike South Carolina,

Pennsylvania does not include a mandate
that requires clearance from the federal de-
partment prior to altering election laws.
' While the battle over the bill rages on in
Harrisburg, academics turn their attention
to the implications of mandatory identiﬁca-
tion at the polls. V '

Mimi Marziani, an adjunct assistant pro-
fessor of public policy at New York Universi-

ty, said that NYU’s Brennan Center forjustice .
found that 11 percent of voters nationally do
_ not have photo identiﬁcation. .. . . ~

Marziani said that requiring photo iden-

I tiﬁcation only remedies in—person voting

fraud, a form that is rare because those
found guilty face up to a $10,000 ﬁne and

I jail time. She added that it wouldn’t make
3 sense for voters“to_do,this since their vote
’ is seemingly"inconsequential. She also said
' that Pennsylvania. does not have a problem
' with voter fraud by any means. ‘ ‘

‘ “I don’t think that four cases of voter
fraud over six years presents much of an
issue in the grand scheme of things,” Mar-
ziani said. I ' I

Proposed transit

By Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

If you listen to the folk song “The
Farmer in the Dell,” chances are
you’ll have no idea what the ﬁfth

_ word means. Nobody farms any-

more; our knowledge of thingslike
dells disappeared long ago, along-
side our understanding of harvest
times and soil conditions.
Another song might soon share
a similar fate if Harrisburg doesn’t
ﬁll the Port Authority’s expected
$64 million budget gap: “The
Wheels on the Bus.” Indeed, the

and ’round may soon seem foreign
to inhabitants of a city whose pub-
lic transportation will have nearly

' halved since 2011.

d When the ﬁrst wheels stopped
turning about two and a half years
ago, it was a good thing. The Port
Authority sponsored reductions as

part of a reform program known

as the Transit Development Plan;
it streamlined decades-old_ routes

and cut wasteful lines to improve _

service. Remember the notori-
ously unreliable 59U, anybody?
If the old Port Authority had been

, a mullet, the new eﬂicient version

was a fashionable bob.
Then, last March, as the reces-

V sion and rising fuel prices took

their toll, another round of cuts
occurred. This round was a lot less

. desirable; the bob was hacked into

an uneven crew cut. Still, few rid-

ers were left stranded; most were V

just inconvenienced.

But with the new expected
reductions, the whole scope of
the transit system could change.
The wheels will stop turning in
many of the suburbs. Even some
urban areas like Troy Hill and A1-
lentown would be cut adrift. The
crew cut will become a thinning
comb—over: A good haircut when
looking for dells, but inadequate

for carrying a region through the _

21st century.
What’s especially sad is the

precedent this sets. With each ,

cut, the public good that transit
provides becomes a seemingly
smaller reason to ﬁll budget gaps;
instead, budget gaps become mere
symbols of wasteful bureaucracy.
For some agencies this might be a
good outlook, but for public tran-
sit, it’s harmful.

We should ratherlview co1lec— _

tive support for transit the same
way we view collective support
for textbook purchases. Ignoring,
for a moment, that textbooks cost
way too much to begin with, think

how many fewer people would buy '

F\"lL”E Lampus

systemilike a had comb-over

books if everybody were forced to
pay full price. Their beneﬁts —-
the knowledge they. impart, their
smell, the back strain —-— would
disappear because the entry price
would be too high.

Thankfully, we collectively
purchase textbooks by buying and
selling them used. Students know
they’ll be able to sell the books
back and are thus willing to pay a
high initial cost. Somebody else
then beneﬁts from the used book.
The process continues, and by the
time an edition becomes obsolete,
many people will have enjoyed it
at a fraction of what they would
have otherwise.

Sadly, for transit, we have no »

mechanism to buy and‘ sell the
beneﬁts of bus and rail service.
There is no'Chegg.com for the
71C. Bus users, of course, can pay
higher fares, but for many, this"
would be the equivalent of forking
over. the full price of a textbook:
The price tag would push many
people out, and we would all be

deprived of the beneﬁts.

Instead, the state —-— or, if nec-
essary, the county — must inter-
vene to ensure non—users pay more
of the fees. This means more taxes.
This is justiﬁable only because
non-transit—users enjoy the ben-

To The Editor,

In regards to thejan. 24 article titled “Pitt
Shouldn’t Let Us Suffer From Bus Cuts,” I ask
the author, Matt Schaff, when was the last
time he rode a bike or spoke to a cyclist? As a
bike commuter, I cannot disagree more with
the author. Bicycles are one of the most time-
honored traditions in a university. Taking a

a bike to class is not a burden, as Schafl’ has
written; on the contrary, it is a pleasure. I do
not know a single bike commuter who does
not enjoy his or her daily ride. In fact, most
would say it is the highlight of their day.

I do, however, agree with Schaﬁ' that bike

While it may be more work, itbwill=lprovide'

you with endless enjoyment. A bike — like
a dog — will only break — or get sick —

when it is not properly cared for. Yes, a bike

may cost a little more than a college student
would like to spend, but with proper care a
bike will last as long as it is cared for. '
While I do agreethat bike owners regu-
larly defy traﬂiclaws, I ask Schaff when was
the last time he jaywalked or crossed an in-

’ tersectionbefore he had the green light?

I implore Schaif to actually speak to‘cy—
clists before making assumptions about bike
commuters.

The smoke has cleared.

After years of reigning as the
go-to makeup look, the smoky
eye trend is now over. In The New
York Times article “You can fall
out ofabed and look good,” lead-
ing makeup artists declared the
end of an era. Smoky is out; sim-
plicity is in.

1 Terry Barber, director of
makeup artistry for MAC Cos-
metics, told The New York Times
that this year’s style is more about
looking like you’re “coming home
from thelparty,” .not “going out to
the party.”

But I think I speak for most
women when I say that how I look
when I fall out of bed is not how I_

look when I’m trying to look like I_

just fell out of bed. The effortless
look that’s growing in -popular-
ity isn’t effortless, but it is fairly
simple. ‘

So put away your charcoal eye
shadow and jet-black liner and
reach for some lighter fare. If

- you’re raring to gogout this week-

end, here’s a quick tutorial for

an au naturel look with a little

shine.

Face

Unless you’re in a ﬁght club
and constantly sport black eyes,
lay off the foundation. For the

most part, I prefer to use just"

moisturizer because it saves time
and doesn’t leave streaks on my
clothes. But if you want to. give
your complexion a little boost, try
lighter products like tinted mois-

turizer and beauty ‘balm cream.-

These even skin tone while giving
the face a natural glow. Follow up

A with some concealer if you want,

and you’re ready to go.

Now that you’ve got a base,
it’s time for a little blush. Allure
magazine’s article “The 10 make-
up colors you’ll want in 2012”
recommends blending pink and
peachy colors for a ﬂushed effect,
but stick to colors that work with
your skin tone. I like applying
berry.-colored cheek stain to the
apples of my cheeks and blending

two shades: a shimmery nude and

slana Del Rey persona
change too criticized’

Gabriela DiDonna
WPTS Contributor

Let’s ignore the talent,_or lack
thereof, of Lana Del Rey for a
minute.

To summarize -a long and
complicated history of this
buzzy singer: She used to per-
form under her real name,
Lizzy Grant. She looked plain,
and made considerably plainer
music. A‘

Grant has since reinvented
herself as Lana Del Rey, 21 mod-
elesque songstress who de-
scribes herself as a “gangster
Nancy Sinatra,” which doesn’t
mean anything when you actu-
ally think about it. She may or
may not have had signiﬁcant
plastic surgery.

Her popularity derives from
an initial PR campaign target-
ing bloggers in the summer of
2011. The hype surrounding her
.ﬁrst single “Video Games” is_n’t
entirely undeserved, although
the song stretches two minutes
too long. Her debut album Born
to Die is set to be released on
Jan. 31 on Interscope Records, a
"major label. _

Then there’s the now infa-
mous “Saturday Night Live”
performance of two weeks ago.
It was bad. She warbled like a
drunken alley cat, moved awk-
wardly due to her ill-ﬁtting
dress and alternated between
touching her hair and her hip.

The conﬁdence of Lana Del
Rey that emanates from videos
like “Blue Jeans” was gone and
what was left was Lizzy Grant,
the shy singer struggling to ﬁnd

- her niche. Celebrities and blog-
gers immediately took to Twit-
ter to critique the performance,

. with veteran newsman Brian
Williams calling it one of the
worst in SNL’s history.

The problem with Lana Del

Rey is not her actual musical‘

ability but more so the man-
ner in which she has become

a lightning rod for criticism.
The fact that we, as listeners,
are still searching for an au-
thenticity in our pop stars is
perhaps a little sad, but it’s not

surprising. If there’s anything ‘
‘ the MTV age should have taught

us by now, it’s that everything is

‘ manufactured.

Some of the greatest musi-
cal stars have been created, not

.born: Punk innovator Iggy Pop

was born James Osterberg, Ma-
donna’s constant reinventions
long ago lost their shock value,
and even Lady Gaga herself
aimed for a career as a tradi-
tional pop singer before creat-
ing her now-infamous persona.
In a way, that’s the point of per-
forming —- the theatrical adop-
tion of a character.

To be absolutely clear: Lizzy
Grant has always been upfront
about the creation of her “Lana
Del Rey” persona. There is no
attempt to pull the wool over
our eyes. She recognizes that

.“Lana Del Rey’? was the con-

certed eﬁbrt of a hired market-
ing team. ,

Indie music blogs and—crit-
ics preserve their own image
of credibility —— and in turn,
authenticity — by cannibal-
izing the very musicians that
they’ve previously championed.
Pitchfork discovers a band; two
months later it’s trashing their
debut album. If there’s one
thing people love, it’s the inevi-
table fall from grace.

The cycle is no different with
Lana Del Rey, although her high
proﬁle brings this process_to the
forefront of our media aware-
ness. She has only performed
live a handful of times, lacking
the road—tested credibility that
comes with the long years of
touring that enable many indie
bands to feel holier-than-thou.

In the realm of indie music,
authenticity is seen as a ne-

heavy. ‘ g
Using an angled brush, take the darker
shade and lightly trace around the corners
of your eyes, going only about a‘ quarter of .
the way in on the bottom lash line and into
the crease. Blend the dark color with the

nude — this willcontour your eye, giving

it more depth.

You can stop here, or line the lash line
with a dark eye shadow. The line will make
lashes seem fuller, and shadow provides a
softer ﬁnish than gel or'liquid' liner. Avoid
lining you waterline — the inside of your
lashline -— with jet-black liner. It doesn’t
work with a natural look, and it closes-in
eyes without making them look larger. 4 j

Finally, finish up with a couple coats of _
mascara on the top lashes only. To avoid
getting rogue specks anywhere except your
lashes, grab a hand mirror and look down
while swiping. When your lashes dry, grab
a eyelash curler and clamp for about 10 to
15 seconds. Curled lashes make eyes look»
more open. If your lashes are too stubborn
to curl, take a hair dryer and blast the curl-
er for about 5 seconds. The heat will help

lock in a curl.
Lips T ’ _ e

To keep the look understated, just swipe
on some lip balm. But if you want a pop of

color, make sure to keepit light. Cosmo-

Final touches . » .

If you have skin that’s prone to being
oily, dust some powder on your T-zone and
any other trouble spots. This look should
last for most of the day, and unlike with the
smoky. style of old, you won’t have to keep
checking the mirror for errant raccoon
eyes.

To transform this natural look into
something edgier for nighttime, use black
liner on the upper lash line and ﬂick it out
for a ’60s look. Or you could use a brighter
color on your lips. The key is to pick one
feature and make it stand out. Keep it sim-

ALBUM REVIEW '

Heems makes socially aware mixtape

Patrick Wagner
Staff Writer

' Three years ago, Heems and the rest of

Das Racist unleashed a style rooted in
mainstream rap but decidedly close to
their progressive multicultural roots in
Brooklyn. A 4

With his first solo mixtape, Nehru

jackets, Himanshu Suri, aka Heefns, has .

taken both ofthose elements and chan-
neled them into a collection that reflects
his deep commitment to hip-hop, A his
hometown and himself. _ V
. The opening track, “Thug Handles,”
readies the listeners’ ears with the
words, “Real talk, real talk, real talk,”
over an ’80s drum machine and darkly
choppy synthesizers. When Heems actu-
ally gets to his rhymes, he delivers them
with an incredible sense of cunning that
will make you laugh and then think about
what you’ve heard for half an hour. '
“I don’t got love handles,” he raps, “I
got thug handles.”
Heems is at his most scathing on
tracks like “NYC Cops,” on which he bru-

tally outlines his views on the New York.

Police Department. Sampling the Strokes’
“New York City Cops,” it transcends that
track to become a lyrical juggernaut.
Throughout the song, Heems makes spe-
cific references to people killed by New
York City police, such as Timothy Stans—
bury, an unarmed 19-year-old who was
shot to death by police in 2004. b
“That was ’94, he was one of three
bodies,” Heems raps about- another
death. “Under Giuliani, well, they had
them a party.” In addition to his own
lyrical push, Heems employs a few oth-
er gifted rappers’, including the talents
of Kool A.D. and Childish Gambino, the
stage name of actor Donald_Glover of
NBC’s popular series“‘Community.”
Danny Brown, a Detroit emcee, ap-
pears on “You Have to Ride the Wave”
and almost steals the show. Brown’s‘
unique ruminations on cunnilingus and

cocaine are delivered in a tone that mir-
rors his off—kilter persona and instantly
stands out as something that’s a little un-
usual in the rap game.

The two—part “Womyn” is a quasi-'

feminist highlight. Over. an innocent
beat, Heems explores ideas about the fe-
male sex with his own self-reﬂexive com-
mentary, skipping between binaries and
‘‘9o21o.’’ , ' ’
“They like to watch shows,” he raps.

“Some of them don’t — they like to read.

prose / Some of them like to date pros.”
Though the song oscillates between light
and heavy issues, it clearly has some-
thing profound at its heart.’

Co-released through Seva NY, a group
that seeks to unite neighbors and ad-
dress common critical needs throughout
New York City, the mixtape is more than
a token gesture. Tracks like “Chakklo”
feature young members of the organiza-
tionrapping in Punjabi. Though English
speakers likely won’t understand what
they’re saying, their recitation is consis-
tently entertaining and their presence is
powerful in and of itself.

Throughout the album, _ the produc-
tion by Mike Finito incorporates Indian
and“American elements in a synthesis

- that strengthens both musical cultures.

“Coca Cola Freestyle” sees‘ Heems ex-

temporaneously rap, “Three shots of

whiskey with no Coca—Cola,” while an
sultry voice sings Bollywood tones for
the hook.

It might only be a mixtape, but Nehru
Jackets is a testament to Heems’ hip-hop
integrity. This isn’t alternative rap, it’s
mainstream rap that does its own thing. .

Illear Heart Full E yes Can't lose

Brian Dollard
Staff Writer

Prince of the power chord and champion of
the arena—rock chorus’ Craig Finn embarks
on a dark lyrical journey accompanied by
a new downbeat sound for his newly re—
leased solo album, Clear Heart Full Eyes.
The Hold Steady — as the band’s name
might suggest — has built a legion of fans
over the past decade with its consistent,

hard-rock sound and storytelling lyrics,

penned by lead singer Finn.

In his first album without his band,
Finn’s dark lyrics do.not differ much from
those of his prior work. But when it moves
away from his familiar distorted guitar
sound, Clear Heart shines brightest.

, The outstandingly rough but still—mut-
ed blues found on openingetrack “Apollo
Bay” could easily be mistaken for a song
from Neil Young’s haunting Ditch Trilogy
albums.

Finn’s hard-rock-infused catechism is
on full display in Clear Heart. “No Future”
alludes to lessons learned from Freddie
Mercury. And the enjoyable folk track
“New Friend Jesus” talks about the narra-
tor’s ﬁctional summer hanging out with
Christ. “It’s hard to suck with Jesus in your
band,” Finn sings.

Musically, Finn diverges from the big
choruses and catchy hooks a Hold -Steady
fan might expect to ﬁnd on the frontman’s
solo album.

The building intensity in the song “Jack-
son” is custom made for a large,‘explosive
chorus, but it stays mellow. Such a change
from what’s expected is a refreshing aspect
of the album.

Unfortunately, Clear Heart - contains
a number of forgettable songs, including
the underdeveloped “Honolulu Blues.” A
jangly, excruciating “Terrified Eyes” will
hopefully mark Finn’s first and last venture
into the country—western style of music.

But these few tracks pose only a minor
distraction to the otherwise enjoyable lis-
tening experience of Finn’s experimenta-

_ tion with a new depression-rock sound.

FILM REVIEW

‘The Artist’ a whimsical, silent world 

Natalie Bell
Magazine Editor

Though a black—and-white silent ﬁlm
might seem a grandiose and almost
pretentiousdisplay of nostalgia, “The
Artist” manages to craftily skirt these
presumptions with ease.

Instead, it comes across as a creative
and beautiful rendering of a story. It’s
the product of writer and director Mi-
chel Hazanavicius playing with ﬁlm the
same way that surrealists dabble with art:
to make something like life — only more
whimsical. And it’s success is evident in
the ten Academy Award nominations the
ﬁlm received.

The story of Peppy Miller and her
one—time idol George Valentin pulls the
audience in without the aid of conven-
tional dialogue. Utilizing a sort of slap-
stick sensibility to get themes across and
sparingly relying on white—on—black dia-
logue screens to convey complex conver-
sations, the story is not at all lacking for
the silence of its actors. The period mu-
sic perfectly accompanies the action to
indulge the audience with sound despite
so little talking.

The ﬁlm begins with silent—movie ac-

Hazanavicius

Starring: Jean Dujardin,

Grade: A

tor George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) at
the peak of his career, meeting adoring
fans —- including the young and strik-
ing Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo). When
Peppy ﬁnds her way into the production
of one of Valentin’s movies, their attrac-
tion is undeniable, and her gregarious
personality — paired with a mole George
dots on her to set her apart from other
girls — lay the foundation for her inevi-
table fame.

George and Peppy’s luck is paradoxical
though. Just as her star rises with the new
hot trend, talkies, his plummets as silent
ﬁlms go out of fashion. As George stum-
bles pitifully into obscurity and his life
begins to unravel, Peppy leaps into the

Panthers find thems

By Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editor

The beginning of the game felt like
an early nonconference matchup:
the kind of contest that happens
over Thanksgiving break when
all the students are home and
more worried about turkey than
basketball.

But this game didn’t take place

over a holiday. It took place in the

middle of the Big East season.
It should have been a game that
— even with an opponent like

‘ Providence — Pitt students would 4

be lined up for hours before tipoff.
Normally, the Oakland Zoo would
have overpowered the booming
voice of the announcer and the
squeak of basketball shoes on the
arena ﬂoor.

But nothing about this Pitt
men’s basketball season has been
normal, or at least not the kind of
normal Panther fans have become
accustomed to. _

This time last year, Notre
Dame and  its burn offense
snapped a nine—game Panther
win streak. The Pitt community
got a little concerned — or as
concerned as a fan base can be
when its team just lost its ﬁrst
Big East game after rattling off
seven consecutive conference
wins. Pitt quickly put its followers
back at ease, winning ﬁve straight
contests and eventually taking
home the Big East regular season

_. championship and earning a No. 1

seed in the NCAA Tournament.
This year, the - Panthers
achieved the reverse. ’
They ﬁnally snapped an eight
game losing streak with an 86-74
winoverProvidenceonWednesday
night. At times, the Panthers
looked like the team many fans

expected them to be this season"

— minus some spotty defense. At
one point in the ﬁrst half, Ashton
Gibbs drained four 3-pointers in

‘ just under two minutes. Starting

point guard Travon Woodall -
back from his injury — scored his
ﬁrst points since suffering a torn
abdomen and groin strain on Nov.
30 against Duquesne and ﬁnished

the game with 17 points.

The biggest worry of the Pitt
fan base last season was whether
the Panthers would earn a No. 1
seed. For over a decade, talk of the
Pitt basketball program has been

about the NCAA Tournament,
seeding, championships 4 and
‘reloading —i not rebuilding.
But even with the victory over
Providence — Pitt’s ﬁrst Big East
win this season — the Panthers
are still 1—7_ in the Big East and
staring at’ three words they
haven’t seen in a while: National
Invitation Tournament.

In the midst of their worst.

season in more _than 10
years, the Panthers probably
wouldn’t mind going back to
those nonconference games in
November when the season still
stretched ahead of them —— before
the eight straight losses, before
the winless conference season,

before Woodall’s injury and before _

words like National Invitation

Tournament started circling the .

Petersen Events Center in hushed
tones.

At this point, the NIT might
be all the Panthers can hope for
—? and a few years ago, Pitt would
have been in danger of not even
qualifyingfor a bid to the NIT.
Until the rule was abolished in
2006, teams couldn’t qualify for"
the NIT if they ﬁnished under
.500. ‘

With the win on Wednesday,
the Panthers moved to" 12-9
overall and, if they can ﬁnish the
season strong, should earn a bid.

' If they don’t ‘use the victory to turn
the season around, the Panthers '

could still struggle to make the
NIT, despite the new rule. Even
with the change, no team with
a sub—.5o0 record has madethe
NIT since 2006.

The Panthers appeared to be
getting back on the right track on
Wednesday —— or at least getting
near it. Gibbs looked happy to have
his backcourt mate Woodall back
as the two combined for 39 points
and nine 3-pointers. Woodall also
dished out nine assists, a high stat
for Pitt this season. Gibbs said
Woodallopens up more space for
him on the ﬂoor.

“He’s an extra playmaker and, '

at the same time, he’s a scoring
option, too,” Gibbs said. “The
defense has to respect him  the
best is to come for him _and this
team.” . .

It remains to be seen if the
balanced scoring -— six players
scored at least seven points --
and lack of turnovers — Pitt

. . - ,.,s~—--5-v .~
  léjl Wei: Li, l,._mD .»:’

turned the ball over just 10 times
— can follow the Panthers for the '
remainder of the season.

A lot of the improvement can
be attributed to Woodall’s return,
something that Providence head
coach Ed Cooley acknowledged
when he called the Panthers a
“totally different team” with’
Woodall on the ﬂoor. Pitt head

‘coach Jamie Dixon seemed to

agree. ,

“Most teams are more
conﬁdent when they have their
point guard on the ﬂoor,” Dixon
said. “I think you could do a
general survey .2. and have a
consensus on that one.”

But Woodall’s return might‘
be a little too late to salvage

Pitt’s season, even if the NCAA V

Tournament selection committees
take his injury into consideration.
If Wednesday’s win was the

- ﬁrst step toward the Panthers’

improvement, there seems to be
one lone hope of Pitt reaching
the NCAA Tournament, and

‘t_hat’s running the table at the
Big East Tournament in March.’

But Pitt could still end the season
on a positive note, and if the
Panthers hold it long enough, that
momentum could extend into
next season. .
Although Gibbs and Nasir
Robinson — who scored 14
points and grabbed six rebounds
on Wednesday — will be gone
next year, Woodall will return

along with freshman guard John’

Johnson, who was forced to grow
up fast this season. Add in.1~.amar
Patterson and ].J. Moore with
another year of experience as well
as a top—5 recruit in center Steven
Adams and a standout high school
point guard in -James Robinson,
and Panther fans could quickly
ﬁnd themselves talking about
NCAA Tournament seeds and
championships again.

The Panthers certainly aren’t
the ﬁrst major program to
experience a down year.

North Carolina was the NIT

Tournament runner-up in 2010,
just a season after winning the
National Championship. Ohio
State won the NIT in 2008 after

going tothe Final Four in 2007."

West Virginia, nearly as consistent
as Pitt, won_ the NIT in 2007, while
Baylor - in the talks for a No. 1
seed in the NCAA Tournament

this year‘ —— ﬁnished as the NIT‘
. runner-up in 2009.

Still, the NIT isn’t where the
Panthers want to be, and it’s
certainly a long way from Pitt’s
version of normal. But if Woodall
really is the answer, then the
Zoo Could be ﬁlled again by next
week. .

Even if the Panthers’ season
doesn’t end where they wanted
it to, at least they can ﬁnish out

' the year strong and build toward

reclaiming the program’s near
unbeatable consistency. Maybe
Pitt fans will look back one“ day
and view this season as no more
than a hiccup in the grand scheme
of normal. g l

This week, Tim Thomas made headlines

when he became the latest athlete to 4

express his political views and decline the

president of the United States at the White

While sport is often said to hold
political weight (see Mandela, Nelson; Ali,
Muhammad; and U.S. Hockey Team, 1980
for examples), few individual athletes
(save for “The Gre‘at'est‘”:) have held enough
political sway that it mattered. Thomas, the

Atlantic Division surpriseof the NBA thisseason

for this season. Rumors abound that,Celtics’
General Manager Danny Ainge will be active at
this year’s trade deadline, especially for deals
that involve moving Paul Pierce or Allen for
young talent.

Also in the_Atlantic Division, the New York
' Knicks have not fared as well as the team’s fans

had hoped. After New York’s front office ac-
quired Carmelo Anthony at last year’s trade
deadline and signed free-agent center Tyson
Chandler to help shore up the defense, fans
looked toward this season with high expecta-
tions.

Unfortunately, neither the offense nor the
defense has lived up to expectations so far. In
New York’s game Tuesday against the Charlotte
Bobcats, ateam with a record of 3-15, Carmelo
Anthony scored just one single point on 0-7
shooting, a career-low. But the Knicks won the
gameto break a six—game losing streak that
leaves their record at 7-10, third place in the
Atlantic. .

.At the top of the division is one of the teams
that has improved the most in the NBA since

last yearr—— Philadelphia. Currently, the Sixers"

are 12-5 and own the third-best record in the
entire Eastern Conference.

The way this team iswinningactually makes .

a lot of sense. No one player dominates theball;
instead, the rock is passed around early and

often to ﬁnd open shots for players. The Sixers-

also do something not a lot of teams do in the

V NBA: They play defense. —

Both factors are evinced by Philadelphia’s
numbers. On defense, the _76ers only give up‘
88 points a game, the second-lowest total in
the league. Additionally, the team is fourth in
rebounding, at 43.9 rebounds a game. The im-
portance of rebounding well goes a long way
toward defensive success. The better a team
rebounds, the fewer chances the opponent has
to score. Both of these factors become huge
come playoff time." _

Offensively, the 76ers are third in points
per game, scoring 99.9 percontest on average.
Assisting that total is the 76ers ﬁfth-ranked
passing game —— they average 22.2 assists per

MEN'S BASKETBALL

FROM PAGE l

“Getting good shots early is a big differ-
ence-maker. We shot the ball well and that
was something good to see,” said Dixon.

Not only did Pitt shoot well, but it also
took better care of the ball and only com-
mitted 10 turnovers.

With the losing streak now behind them,
the Panthers are looking forward to moving
on and trying to build upon their ﬁrst Big
East victory.

“It feels good,” Gibbs said in a post—game
press conference. “But at the same time,
we’ve got to move onto the next game. We
can hold our heads high, but we have another
game on Saturday.” . .

Following a back-and—forth start to the
game, junior point guard Travon Woodall
— starting for the second consecutive game
after returning from his groin and abdomen
injuries — drained a 3-pointer to give the
Panthers a four—point lead and spark an
11-3 Pitt run.

The basket was Woodall’s ﬁrst since
returning from injury. After struggling
against Louisville last Saturday, the junior
point guard looked more like his old self
and ﬁnished the game with 17 points and
9 assists. . »

“I just didn’t feel like I had enough legs
under me Saturday,” Woodall said in a post-
game press conference. “Tonight, I just went
out there and played basketball.”

  
  

“We’ve got a lot
more work to do
and a lot more wins

  to go.”
-Travon Woodall

Providence head coach Ed Cooley said
Pitt is a transformed team with its point
guard back in the lineup.

A “They’re a totally different team [with
Woodall],” Cooley said in a press conference.
“Everybody’s in their roles. Everybody’s in

their comfort zone.”

_ Dixon agreed and said that plenty of
teams would struggle without their start-
ing point guard.

“Most teams are more conﬁdent when
they have their point guard on the ﬂoor,”
he said. “The players have conﬁdence in
him.”

Just as the Friars were beginning to
slowly cut into the Panthers’ lead, Gibbs
exploded.

By the time Gibbs ﬁnished scoring 14
consecutive points, Pitt’s lead burst to 15.

“I was feeling it,” Gibbs said. “Once one
shot went in, I just felt good. They gave me
open opportunities, and I took advantage
of them.”

After the break, Providence tried to battle
back with the help of guard Vincent Council’s
game-high 26 points and got the deﬁcit to
as few as seven points midway through the
second half. But every time the Friars got
close, the Panthers responded.

“When we went into the locker room, we
talked about sustaining the lead,” Woodall
said. “Coach Dixon made some great calls,
and we wanted to get the best possible shots
up, and that helped us get the victory.”

The Panthers will try to begin a winning "' ’
streak when they ﬁnish up a three-game
home stand and host Georgetown Saturday
afternoon at the Petersen Events Center.

“We’ve got a lot more work to do and a
lot more wins to go,” Woodall said. i

make as an INDIVIDUAL. This is-the only
public statement I will be making on this
topic. TT.”

1 I’m not at all sure if Thomas is trying
to prove something or just express his
opinion. Either way, at least he actually had
a reason for skipping the White House visit,
unlike Pittsburgh Steeler James Harrison,
who snubbed former President George W.
Bush in 2006 and President Barack Obama
in 2009. Harrison’s reasoning was much
more, uh  well, you decide. About his
skipping the trip, he said, “If you want to
see the Pittsburgh Steelers, invite us when
we don’t win the Super Bowl. So as far as
I’m concerned [Obama] would have invited
Arizona if they ,won [the Super Bowl] .” Yes

James, that’s how this thing works.

However, if I were one_ of Thomas’
teammates, I would have told him to suck
it up and be with his team. Trying to make a
point with an absence and a Facebook post
only becomes a distraction. Not everybody
gets to meet the president, after all. If
Thomas wanted to make a point, he should
have gone and talked to the guy and maybe
even aired his grievances. ' '

I’m not saying that this route would
work any better than the player’s chosen
one. But really, discussion has to be better
than a Facebook post, right? "3

~ game. What astounds me is that seven players on

this team average more than 10 points a game.
The leading scorer, Lou Williams, at 15.4 points
per game only plays 24.8 minutes per game and
has not started once. The team’s success so far
is a testament to what Coach Doug Collins has
instilled in his players: the importance of re-
bounding and sharing the basketball.

Allthree of these teams presentpotential for
intriguing storylines later on this season. I expect
Boston to blow up its team, since the current run
of this “Big Four” seems to be over.»Rumors over
the summer said that Ainge looked to deal Rondo
straight up for guard Chris Paul, who ended up
in Los Angeles with the Clippers.

New York has a much better chance thanthe
Celtics to get its season together. The Knicks’
backcourt issues should subside slightly now
that rookie guard Iman Shumpert is back from
an injury and playingwell. Baron Davis will also
help. When motivated, the 14-year vet is a solid
ﬂoor general. i A " '
