aging them, to consult with the in-
structors of their children following
his speech.

‘Women's choral will render several
selections while the parents are be-
ing escorted to the third -ﬂoor. There

New Railroad Pensions Bill S co red
  As ‘Added Expense’By Dr. Fitzgerald

 

“If the private pension system had
been mismanaged, if the employes had
complained, if there had been any
criticism at all, then the new railroad
pensions law would be justiﬁed,”
stated Dr_ Thomas Fitzgerald, presi-
dent of the Executives’ Conference of
Eastern Railroads, before the labor
problems class Wednesday.

Dr. Fitzgerald vigorously opposes
the new railroad pensions bill which
was passed in the ﬁnal 10 days of the
last Congressional -session. The bill
provides for a retirement board of
three, which is required to deduct 2
per cent from each employe’s pay and
double that amount per capita from
the payroll. It applies to employes
on all railroads. An employe may re-
tire at 60, but he must retire at the

age of 70 after 30 or more years’ serv-
ice which need not necessarily be
continuous,

The objection which Dr. Fitzgerald
voiced was that the government is
aiming to administer the railroad
pension law which for years has been
managed successfully by the employ-
ers at no expense to the emp-loyes.

“The government has never loaned
the railroad companies a dollar that
hasn’t been paid back," stated Dr.
Fitzgerald. Although the Reconstruc-
tion Finance corporation loaned them
$400,000,000, all but $1,000,000 had
been returned with 6 per cent inter-
est, The loan had been approved by
the Interstate Commerce Commission;
and had collateral backing to the,
ratio of 4 to 1. he said,

DirectdrmA,tt-ai:ks
NRA At Inquiry

Dr. Koch Decries Suppression Of
1 Opinions. In Colleges

Dr. Lucien Koch, director of Com-
monwealth college at Mena, Arkansas,
discussed the advantages of workers’
education and the effect of the New
Deal on the laborer before an enthu-
siastic Inquiry audience Vvednesday.

“The only way we can get out of
our present slump is by striking out
boldly and radically for ourselves,”
Dr. Koch said. “Our present school
system does not advocate this. There
are many liberal thinkers among our
teachers but they cannot express their
opinions because the universities are
controlled by vested interests which
have proﬁted by the present economic
system.” ‘

In discussing the condition of the
worker, Dr, Koch ﬂayed the New Deal
a.nd its provisions.

“The ﬁrst measure of the NRA,
which was to raise real wages, was a
farce and an empty gesture,” he said.
“T-he wages of the working class as
a whole are lower since the New Deal
came. The proﬁts of industry have
increased, and instead of greater dis-
tribution of wealth there is greater
concentration, The Federal govern-
ment has come to the aid of industry
rather than the common laborer.

“Education in workers’ leadership
challenges the present school system.
These workers’ schools stand for a
change inthe economic system.”

Informal Dance
Tomorrow Open

To All Students

Ches Walters’ Music Scheduled
'For CPSF Affair; Hours
Will Be From 9 To 1

 

By Charles B. Holstein

Too long have the boys who really
care about it heard the beautiful
“Sweetheart of Sigma Chi” number
ruined by amateur and professional
singers who just‘ didn’t feel the right
spirit of the thing.

Tomorrowv night, Cliff .’vicLain’s
boys from the Sigma Chi house are
scheduled, to do it justice at the an-

-nual interfraternity dance and sing.

They promise to inject the right feel-
ing into certain lines, to quaver at the
appropriate times, and to come
through with a whooping “She's the
sweetheart of Sigma Chi” at the
ﬁnish,

Twelve other fraternities, however,
stoutly maintain that Sigma Chi won’t
win the ﬁrst prize loving cup award-
ed to the sing winner. Delta Tau
Delta will exclaim melodiously, “It
takes a good man to be a Delt,” and
will close with a touching presenta-
tion of “Delta Shelter’? (pronounced
“Shelta” for the sake of rhythm.)

’I‘o1norrow night’s affair is the most
elaborate planned for this annual
event. Ches Vvalters’ 14 piece ABC
broadcasting band, which won a big
hand from 1,000 dancing guests at the
fall style show sponsored by the Pitt
News,-., has been booked to play-from
9 to 1 o’clock in the main ballroom of
the William Penn hotel, Roberta
VVelch, Texas torch singer who was
recently featured at the -Chatterbox,
and Dick Stern, attraction on the En-
right theater stage this week, have
been contracted to take up the sing-
i_n..;’. where the fraternity teams leave
off.

The sing will take place from 9 to
10 o’clock. The whole affair is, of
course, informal. And although it is
primarily a function of fraternity
members, all. students in the Univer-
sity are invited. Last year, the non-
fraternity attendance was almost as
strong as the Greek attendance.

From. comments heard immediately
after the affair last year and those
tossed off this week on campus, the
sing and dance of the CPSF seems to
be perhaps the most pleasantly an-
ticipated event on the social calendar.
The general informality and intermix-
ing of patrons which features this
event appear to be unique, observers
say.

Tickets for the affair are priced at
$1.50, and are on sa.le by Miss Alice
Beatty, Room 801, Cathedral, as well
as fraternity men.

Clifton McLain, C35, Sigma Chi
president, is general chairman
of the dance; Henry George,
E35, Pi Kappa Alpha, is in charge of

the sing; Leslie Wilkins, C35, Delta.

'l.‘au Delta, heads the CPSF, which
sponsors the event.

Tropical Heat Battles Polar {Cold
As Students Wander ‘Lost In A Fog’

 

By Ray Maclntyre

VVhile students wandered around in
a heavy fog on Tuesday, unaware that
anything unusual was taking place,
L. B. Sisson, of the Smoke Abatement
fellowship of Mellon Institute, was
taking pictures and making observa-
tions from the top of the Cathedral.

It appears that tropical heat and
polar cold met in a terriﬁc battle, and
Pittsburgh was located in the war
zone. The meeting of these two
caused an inversion of temperature:
that is to say, it was warmer at the
top of the Cathedral than it was on
the ground,

Mr. Sisson explained the situation
involving fog, smoke, and tempera-
ture inversion thus: “The wet air
was warmer than the ground, and
upon contact with the chilled earth
tended to lose its moisture, which ap-

peared as fog. At the same time, the
layer of warmer air developed at
about 1,500 to 2,000 feet above the
ground, This warmer upper air acted
like a ceiling, holding the still, lower
air close to the ground.”

According to Mr. Sisson, the situa-
tion was made dangerous by the
smoke, which was not dispelled be-
cause of the stillness of the air in
the lower strata. It was a similar
haze in December of 1932 to which
was attributed the epidemic of inﬂu-
enza and pneumonia that followed.

“The most available remedy for
keeping smoke out of the air during
fog periods is the use of smokeless
fuel. This could be done by most fuel
users as an emergency measure, if
they would keep small amounts of
such fuel on hand,” remarked Mr.
Sisson.

Free—For Whom ‘.7
HE DAILY PRTNCETONIAN has some l11ter-
esting observations about tl1e noble, selt'-sacr1ﬁe-
ing publishers who guide American newspapers 10-
day. It writes in part:

. Although a ceaseless clamor for “free-
dom of the press” has rent the air since tl1e be-
ginning of the Roosevelt administration, the
self-imposed censorship which is eating a.wa_v
at the prestige of journalism is one of ‘the
crimes of this age. As Heywood Broun point-
ed out, in his recent address before the fresh-
man class, all the newspapers in California,
during the recent strike, met under a hirehng
of Mr. Hearst and decided what the editorial
policy of the next day should be. The deal‘
which Upton Sinclair received at the hands of
western papers is of such a. nature as to turn
any righteous man ’s stomach.

If one should ask newspaper owners “Free-
dom of what?” a. rational answer might be
difficult. Perhaps it may be freedom to sup-
press the most important news stories of the
day; freedom to pay their employes the same
disgraceful salaries, while they pursue a hypo-
critical cry for the social justice in their edito-
rial columns; freedom to be controlled by self-
seeking interests. . . .

Lethargy In Louisiana

UEY LONG SAYS that Louisiana State univer-

sity owes him mone,v. Huey lent all the un-

dergraduates in L.S.U. $7 for that memorable trip
to Tennessee, and now he wants it back.

Now $7 per man might not be a high price for
the good feeling of Louisiana ’s Kingfish. \Vhat
Huey can do to state appropriations might almost
indicate the funding of the debt by the university
itself. But the creditor-debtor relationship, down
in Louisiana, is not bringing the college boys and
girls flocking to Huey ’s program for a third party.

The Senator says he believes university grad-
uates are going to sweep his third party into the
federal government within two years.

College graduates, he believes, may have been
educated for leisure, but they have not been edu-
cated for unemployment and hopelessness.

Louisiana l1asn’t become excited about the idea.

. Maybe Huey is a little ahead of his time.

‘General, Loose,’ Banks Finds Reply
Of Hearst To C o l 1 e gi a t e Editors

By Edwin Banks

ILLIAM RANDOLPH HEARST, publisher, whose

front page editorials bristle with as many capital-
ized phrases as columns by Florence Fisher Parry, has
clariﬁed his position on internationalism and disar1na-
ment, for the beneﬁt of perplexed editors of American
college newspapers in a. statement dated the day ‘follow-
ing a Pitt News interview with Arthur Brisbane on the
question.

Blessed with the intellectual energy to tackle the
“laborious nature of the questions” presented to him by
the Association of College Editors—questions left un-
answered by the noted English publisher, Lord Beaver-

brook——Mr. Hearst ha.s drafted a reply. Not answering-

the questions directly because he feared they were “pro-
pounded on the recognized ‘have you stopped beating
your wife?—-Answer yes or no’ basis,” the American pub-
lisher has stated his beliefs in very general principles.

First of all, Mr. Hearst believes “in nationalism AND
internationalism each in its proper place.” No thinking
person could object to that opinion whether he were a
nationalist or an internationalist. It is a profound atti-
pttlde-like believing in justice or truth.

‘Secondly, Mr. Hearst believes in policies which beneﬁt

‘every nation “VVITHOUT SACRIFICING THE INTER-

ESTS OF OUR OWN PEOPLE.” No internationalist, no
economist who advocates lowering our tariff barriers,
the publisher may remember, maintains that free trade
will promote the p1'ospe1'ity of foreigners at the expense
of the United States. These internationalists, rather,
point out that the adoption of their program by our gov-
ernment would assist in restoring our prosperity AND
the prosperity of the rest of the world. (Capitalizations
mine—the result of Mr. Hearst’s inﬂuence.)

Thirdly, Mr. Hearst believes “that honest debts. should
be paid,” that the war debts, consequently, should be
met by the owing nations. He compares this great inter-
national transaction to an ordinary business contract,
which even Mr. Hearst should realize by this time is not
quite so simple. The principle is a commonplace in
economics that international debts can be paid off
virtually only by importing goods from the debtor to the
creditor country By loudly favoring the continuance of
our tariﬁ policy, Mr. Hearst has shown that he is cer-
tain Americans don’t want European goods. If Ameri-
cans don't want their war loans. paid back in the single
method by which Europe can pay them back, perhaps it
might not be a. bad idea for the United States to cancel
the obligations. This solution to the dilemma of Mr.
Hearst's position, the publisher has not yet considered
editorially.

Finally, Mr. Hearst believes “in sustaining efforts to
persuade nations to disarm.” But he does not believe in
disarmament until “nations are willing to disarm.” Here
again, Mr. Hearst seems to have entangled himself in a
dilemma. He has consistently boomed for a big army and
navy through the media of his newspapers and his news
reels. He has constantly been stirring up trepidation
over the supposed imminence of an attack by some Euro-
pean government, In the pa.st he has conjured up “yel-
low perils” and “red perils.” If he keeps on ur ing
America to increase her armaments, how can he expect
the Japanese and the Nazis, for example, to curb their
own military preparations? How can he assist in mak-
ing any nation willing to disarm when his efforts to make
debt-burdened America spend even more on instruments
of slaughter are unceasing? How can his militant mili-
tarism be reconciled with his belief in attempts toward
disarmament? Mr. Hearst has not attempted to har-
monize these apparently conﬂicting principles.

So the speciﬁc questions submitted by the Association
of College Editors to William Randolph Hearst have been
answered by the publisher in generalities that have a
“more laborious nature" than the questions themselves.
And so college editors will be able to write long editorials
about Mr. Hearst and his principles just as this column-
ist has done. V

C. .3. Shaw Play
Pointed Today

—Maurer

 

By I-Ierrymon Maurer

N THE DAYS VVHEN Einstein and his ‘theory of rela-

tivity were sharing honors with Bernard Shaw as a
popular subject of cartoons, Oliver I-Ierford featured long,
lank Shaw bending solicitously over short, stout Einstein.
The cartoon carried a bit of dialogue:

SHAW‘. Say, Einie, do you really think you understand
yourself?
EINSTEIN. No, Bernie, do you?

There is no need today for anyone to shout. down the
illusion that Shaw is incomprehensible. Today we say
that Shaw is frank a.nd open. We dismiss him in an-
other wa.y. The theory of Man and Superman, for in-
stance, we unhesitatingly relegate to the distant period
of before the war. Indeed, we have become so accus-
tomed to dating Shaw's plays that we arch our eyebrows
in blase disdain at a play like “Heartbreak House,”
whereas the whole series of Heartbreak House plays is
as effective today as yesterday. Tolstoy wrote “Fruits of
Enlightenment” in 1889. Shaw composed his play during
the war. Both are as alive today as are Edmund Wil-
son’s recent “Beppo and Beth” and Thomas Mannie “The
Magic Mountain.”

Heartbreak House is a house of delirium. Ellie Dunn,
romantically in love, is at ﬁrst ﬁrm in her conviction not
to marry Boss Mangan. The name betrays the man.
But when she has drunk a few droughts of the insane
intoxicated atmosphere of Heartbreak House, s-he tum-
bles down the steps of illusion, and in cool oppressive
fashion assures Mangan that she doesn’t care if he did
ruin her father’s business. There follows insane, calcu-
lating dialogue until:

MANGAN (clutching at his bursting temples).
this is a crazy house. 01' else I’m going clean off my
chump. Is she making a swap with you she to have
your husband and you to have hers?

ELLIE. Well you don’t want us both, do you?

MANGAN (throwing himself into the chair distra.cte(l-

Oh,

1}’). ‘Iy brain won't stand it. My head’s going to split.
Help! Help me to hold it. Quick: hold it: squeeze it.
Save me.

At this moment our heads begin to swirl; the blood
begins to pound in our temples, and we are about to re-
quest the use of a. corner of l‘vIangan’s chair. We feel the
proud disillusion and the forced dramatic unconcern of
Ellie. And, over and above these rea.cl'.ions, adding to
them and explaining them, are feelings of hysteric mad-
ness, of dozens of people running around waving their
arms in a darkly-lighted house.

There is Hector Hushabye, the handsome man, the
dashing lover. Hector is really brave: “He has a dread-
ful trick of getting out of one third-ﬂoor window and
coming in another, just to test his nerve.” He is a great
poser: “Hector, left alone, contracts his brows, and
falls into a day-dream. He does not move for some time.
Then he folds his arms. Then, throwing his hands be-
hind him, and gripping one with the other, he strides
tragically once to and fro. Suddenly he snatches his
walking-stick from the teak table, and draws it; for it
is a sword-stick. He ﬁghts a desperate duel with an
imaginary antagonist, and after many vicissitudes runs
him through the body up to the hilt. He sheathes the
sword and throws it on the sofa, falling into another
reverie, as he does so. He looks straight into the eyes
of an imaginary woman; seizes her by the arms-; and
says «ina deep and thrilling tone, ‘Do you love me!’
The captain comes out of the pantry at this moment; and
Hector, caught with his arms stretched out a.nd his ﬁsts
clenched, has to account for his attitude by going
through a series of gymnastic exercises.”

BUT IHAVE SLIGHTED THE CAPTAIN. The cap-

tain is somewhat sane. He says, “I’ve stood on the
bridge for eighteen hours in a typhoon. Life here is
stormier, but I can stand it.” Captain Shotover alone is
solid and sane enough to keep us from mingling our own
howls and shrieks with those of the Heartbreak House in-
habitants.

But, however stable the captain may be, the tempo
beats madly on. T'here is the self-satisﬁed, blase self-
criticism of Hector: “In this house we know all the
poses: our game is. to ﬁnd out the man under the pose.”
And, “There is no sense in us. We are useless, danger-
ous, and ought tobe abolished.” And the action be-
comes madder and more hysterical.

This Soul's Prison

Finally Captain Shotover diagnoses and prescribes:

HECTOR. And this ship we are in? This soul’s prison
we call England? _

CAPTAIN SHOTOVER. The captain is in his bunk
drinking bottled ditchwate-r; and the crew is gambling in
the forecastle. She will strike and sink and split. Do
you think the laws. of God will be suspended in favor of
England because you were born in it?

HECTOR . . . What am I to do?

SHOTOVER. Do‘? Nothing simpler.
ness as an Englishman.

HECTOR. And what may my business as an English-
man be, pray?

SHOTOVER. Navigation. Learn it and live; or leave
it and be damned.

But before anyone is able to decide what the prescrip-
tion means a. “dull, distant, explosion is heard.” Bomb-
ing begins. Hector, true to character, turns on all the
lights in the house. Shotover announces: “The Church
is on the rocks, breaking up. I told him it would unless
it headed for God’s open sea.” Mangan runs for the false
safety of the gravel pit. A terriﬁc explosion is heard.
Mangan is destroyed.

But the inmates of Heartbreak House, who have main-
tained during the bombing——in somewhat forced fashion,
perhaps——their reckless proud disillusion, say only, “But
what a glorious experience! I hope they’ll come again
tomorrow night.” Heartbreak House had forgotten Shot-
over’s prescription. Perhaps they didn’t listen to it.

There is little comment to be made. The play’s the
thing. And any discussion of what Shaw has not said
in the play, together with ampliﬁcations of what he has,
overﬂows into one of his most successful prefaces.

Shaw succeeds in making us feel the madness of the
house, the uncontrollable irresistible madness that moves
inevitably towards disaster. His analysis is thorough.
He is not content with unveiling the vanity, the silliness,
the amorality of his characters. He goes a step further
and shows the self-contentedness of their self—criticisms.
His scene is not England alone.

Very good, some of you say, very good. But is it true?
A friend of mine once asked this question and answered
it in the same sentence. “I hope it isn’t true,” he said
in a tone of vast regret. .

In the preface Shaw analyzes the factors which pro-
duced the dirty stiffling atmosphere against which Heart-
break Houses weakly battle. He discusses at some
length the social and scientiﬁc attitudes which have
taken “conscience from human affairs,” and “mind from
the universe.”  describes the madness of the war
times, But his essay should be read after the play, not
before it. We listen to the causes more carefully, if we
have felt ﬁrst the horror of the effects.

--Pearlman Says

Columnist Replies To Letter, Denies Daniel Webster
Can Soothe Our Contemporary Fevers

 

By Raymond R. Pearlman
AM TAKING the liberty of answering a “letter for the editor
of the Pitt News,” about the speech of Daniel \Vebst.er in which
he upbraided persons for their constant clamor against how unjust
things are. The writer of the letter believes that it is “proper that
Daniel VVebster’s opinion should be more highly regarded than the
many irrational doctrines of persons who believe that to be radical
is to be brilliant.” At the onset, may I say that “to be radical is to

be brilliant” is not always true, but¢

I most dogmatically believe that the,
reverse of that is: to be brilliant is to .'
be radical!

Furthermore, I should like to ask,
the writer of that letter what Daniel}
Webster has to do with coeval condi-l
tions, Thank God, he is dead, buried,
and that worms have had their ﬁll!
People who would resurrect him are
provoking, and the tragedy of the»
whole matter is that there are all too,
many. They are afraid to cast off:
obsolete ideas and institutions which,‘
at this very time especially, are the.
bane of our existence. Do I need to
remind the reader of our senile con—;
stitution and, to be more at home, of;
Pennsylvania's ow11 state rights? 0*
mores! O temporal is the only ex-,
clamation I can think of.

But let me revert to the brilliant!
sophistic speech of Daniel VVebster.|
I plan to tear it apart that I might.
open up this person’s eyes so that she}
can see the sham, the untruth of thisl
piece of oratory. Had we a. victrolal
record of this speech, I would surely|
have not a chance: As far as VV-eb-i,
ster’s oratory is concerned, no one is}
able to deny his eloquence; as far as;
his ideas on social aspects are con-‘
cerned, especially when viewed apart
from his dynamic and persuasive per-
sonality, Vfebster is nil_ “Men do not
convince by their arguments, but by
their personalities.” Of another
orator this statement was never more
true.

I know it is easy to tear down.
Why , not? Tearing down for con-
structive motives is a noble thing to‘,
do, and we need more of it. I dislike
M,.encken’s type of criticism. His is
sheer iconocla.sm_ This I believe is
not. But let us see what the states-
man Vv'ebster—-—“the proper authority”
——expounds:

66 N A COUNTRY of unbounded lib-

erty”——need I go further. May
I ask what liberty? “In a country of
perfect equality”-——Wha.t equality be-
tween, negro and white, between on-
trepreneur and laborer? “They cry
out loudly against all banks and cor-
porations.” I say, we have the right
to cry out loudly; yes, we should
howl, scream, ululate-——we who are
witnesses of Insull’s intrigues, Kron-
ger deceptions, Stavisky scandals.
“In a country where property is more
evenly :livided"'—Utter -foolishness!
Every freshman in economics knows

that half the families in America are
propertyless; that seven-eights of the
l'a.m.ilies hold out one-eighth of the
national wealth, while one per cent
of the families hold more than the re-
maining ninety-nine. “In a country
where wages of labor are high beyond
parallel, they would teach the laborer
he is but an oppressed slave." VVho
cares of the relationship of wages be-
tween the United States and Japan?
That is beside the point, Here’s the
straight goods: Average wages in all
industries and for all employees range
from $500 to $600 per annum. The
average wage of the adult worker in
the leading American industries is
seldom less than $450 and seldom
more than $600. In short, the range
is from an average daily wage for the
year of $1.50 to $2.00, In 1909 the to-
tal amount spent in wages was $3,-
‘-34,734,000. If we divide this number
by the average number of wage-earn-
ers, we secure a quotient of $517.91.
“These dissatisﬁed people can want
nothing, sir, but to enjoy the fruits of
other men’s labors.”
would dare lie——would dare distort
the truth as he! Look at these ﬁg-
ures: In 1890 the income from capi-
tal for the aggregate wealth of the
nation was 65 billions of dollars. The
poorer classes, of which there were
five and one-half million, had only an
aggregate wealth of 800 million;
while 56 billion was distributed among
one and one-half million rich, Is not
Webster’s statement an utter distor-
tion of the real facts? Is not the re-
verse true?——that the rich are living
from the fruits of other men's toil.
Rather had I lived in a barbarian
and savage civilization! This damned
Sympathy of ours! Itkeeps a.1ive and
fosters all the various forms of our
contemporary incompetence —— the
blind, the dumb, the deformed, the
idiotic, the imbecile, the lazy. At
least in a savage society these were
wanting.
ES, VVHAT VVE NEED is more

No honest man -

defects of his society but to die, if
necessary, on the cross for them!
What respect for a man like Web-
ster can we have? In him, I recog-
nize no sense of “law and justice that
have made his fame enduring.” I
have only contempt for him and for

-all people like him who see nothing

but “wonder in this glorious civiliza-
tion of ours.” If it is radical to work
to improve society, then we need
more radicals! If it is radical for
one to desire to eliminate the shanty-
towns on Seventeenth and Liberty
avenues, on the wharf of the Alle-
gheny river, and the putrid and ﬁlthy
shacks on top of Mt. Washington hill
—then what we need are more radi-
cals and agitators. However, I see
nothing radical in a desire to improve
society, Vvhen he mentioned agita-
tion to improve society, Webster
meant disturbance a11d disorder.
When one stands in the corner of
Fr-ankstown and Penn avenues and
attempts to instill propaganda into
the minds of the poor, to arouse them
from. their wretched poverty and ig-
no1'ance——tl1is Webster calls the diffu-
sion of corrupt principles and the
destruction of the moral sentiments
and the moral habits of society.

To sum up what I have said: There
are all too many people who have the
wrong conception of radicalism. They
are afraid to cast aside the old when
it has been proved to be destructive.
They appeal to us with the national-
istic sentiments of our statesman of
bygone clecades—with opinions which
have no bearillg upon our own condi-
tions.

Panthers Center Attention
On Game With Tech Skibos

One week from today tl1e last vestiges of a glorious 1934 Pitt
football season will have passed into history.

rumors of post-season ball games

dope at present has it that Pitt’s squad will hang shut the locker
doors for the last time after the Tecl1 battle on Thanksgiving.

The last hurdle on the track ﬁnds the Panthers stepping high and
packing plenty of drive to clear the Tech obsta.cle.

True, there are still
which may involve Pitt, but the

Carnegie Tech,

however, is a team which is mightyé

hard to ﬁgure out. This point may be
referred to Duquesne Duke’s, if neces-
sary.

A mere process of considering the
comparative scores of both outﬁts
against Notre Dame gives Pitt a gen-
erous margin, inasmuch as the Irish
licked Tech and Pitt made the South
Benders look pretty bad.

But they’re still saying that nothing
which has gone before matters when
Pitt meets Tech and it’s a pretty safe
hunch to follow. Tech can recover
any prestige she has lost by hanging
one on the Panthers; that’s a lot of
incentive. Pitt is out to hang on to
that city trophy and to give the world
one ﬁnal picture of what a really good
ball club is like.

Sixteen To Graduate

For 18 Pantliei‘ players the Thanks
giving Day game will be the ﬁnal one
they shall play while wearing the Pitt
colors, barring any of this p. s. (post-
season) -stuff. An entire first team,
with the exception of two positions,
will line up for diplomas in June and

be. heard from no more on Pitt
rosters_
Captain Hartwig, Ken Ormiston,

George Shotwell, Bob Hoel, Stan
Olejniczak, Harvey Rooker, Miller
Munjas, Mike Nicksick, and Izzy
Weinstock are the men of the ﬁrst
team who are saying goodbye. Henry
Weisenbaugh, foremost of the re-
serves, and Karl Seifert, Les Wilkins,
Frank Kutz, Art Ruff, Lou ‘Nojcihov-
ski, John Valenti, Cha.rley Gongloff,
and Vlfalter Balasia, will * also be
through.

Some of these men will, in all prob-
ability, be invited to play with the
city all—stars in a game against the
Pittsburgh Pirate professional team
for the cause of charity. It is a cer-
tainty, however, that none of the Pan-
ther boys will turn anything but a
deaf ear to such invitations until it
is deﬁnitely known that Pitt will not
play a post-season affair.

A strange malady, perhaps known
as the “bowl-weevil,” has spread over
the country and caused numerous
“bowl” attractions to come up. “Sugar
Bowl,” and “Orange Bowl” are now
being placed on the market to vie
with California’s “Rose Bowl.” The
first-named idea may be just a lot of
Huey Long, but the “Orange Bowl”
affair seems to be gathering a lot of
support down Florida way. As yet
none of these stunts has offered Pitt
a bid.

Post-Season Ideas Galore

Meanwhile, the lull of the season
has sports writers concocting all
sorts of post-season games. Aside
from compiling huge volumes of sta-
tistics to show how many quarter-l
miles the backs have traveled on Sat-
urday afternoon, these gentlemenhave
seen ﬁt to suggest Pitt-Colgate, Min-
nesota-Ohio State, and Alabama-
Stanford as great attractions.

What the writer would like to see
is having six of these outﬁts in the
same stadium on the same afternoon
in a round robin affair to determine
something or other. Any price at all
could be named on the seats and six
people would be after each one for
that series. It is perhaps just as
well that such an arrangement is im-
possible. The folks who were lucky
enough to see the game would stay
home on Saturdays for the rest of
their lives—tl1ere would be nothing
greater to see.

Meanwhile the Panthers are hard
at it again and are endeavoring to
polish up still more on the attack to
throw against Carnegie, The Navy
would be surprised to hear that.

Meet Buckeyes at Columbus

Announcement was made Tuesday
by the Ohio State authorities that
Pitt would play the Buckeyes at C0-
lumbus in the 1936 season. The game
has been hanging ﬁre as a return con-

here in 1932. The meeting in 1936
will be the fourth between the two
schools, the series score standing at
one loss, one victory, and one tie for
each team.

Nuts To The Swimmers

Members of the Pitt swimming beam won-
der if Coach Pat: Corr, one of our Pittsburgh

Panther Harriers
Close Season In

Senior AMA Run

Wagenhouser, McDonald, Howe,
Kirkpatrick And Albright
End College Careers

Five members of the cross-country
team will make their last appearance
in the hill-and-dale sport for Pitt with
the running of the annual senior AMA
championship Saturday afternoon over
the six-mile course in Schenley Park.

Charles Kirkpatrick, Bill Albright,
and Kenneth Vvagenhouser, veterans
of three seasons, will be bringing to
a close three years of brilliant achieve-
ment in the cross-country ﬁeld. The
trio has been main factors in the suc-
cess which has accompanied the rec-
ords compiled by harrier teams for
the past few seasons. Along with
them Charles Howe and Emmett Mc-
Donald will be wearing the Pitt colors
for the last time. ‘With the excep-tion
of M;cDonald, who is a track letter-
man, the four seniors were responsi-
ble for the ﬁne showing made in the
IC4A by Pitt last Monday at New
York. -

The ﬁve seniors will comprise one
of the four teams that Coach Olson
is entering in the meet tomorrow aft-
ernoon. Kirkpatrick will act as cap-
tain for this outﬁt.

Enter other Teams

Besides the __seniors competing,
Coach Olson is entering three other
teams, one made up of sophomores
and juniors, another composed of the
freshman “A” squad, and the last-
made up of the freshman “B” team.

Musico, captain, Tost, Groat, Leggin,
Loncher, Prosnik, Vvalmsley, and John
Albright will comprise the soph-junior
outﬁt. The “A” team will have
Theriault, Turchik, Emens, Nord-
strom, -Crawford, and Blean represent-
ing it_ Competing for the “B” squad

will be Horvath, captain, Heller,
Ottie, Roberts, Howell, and McCon-
nell_ Several other hill—and-dalers

from Pitt will be running unattached,
those being Connelly, Kopp, Montroll,
and Cummings.

VVagenhouser will be defending his
title won last year in the local meet,
while the Pitt teanrwill be striving
to keep ﬁrst honors acquired last year
in the same event.

Shortly after Thanksgiving vaca-
tion, the harriers will transfer their
activity to the ﬁeld house where in-
door track will hold sway during the
winter. Changes have been made in
the winter quarters which will im-
prove conditions for running indoors
considerably. ,

News Reviews Record Compiled By Coach

‘Skip’ Gougl:er’s Freshman Football Team,

Yearlings Close Season
With Victories Over
Tech And State

By William K. Trosen

With Thanksgiving just around the
corner, which means that the college
football season is in its last stages,
now is the time that cub reporters
dig into the past records intent on
writing a season resume of some par-
ticular football team, In this case
that particular team is the Panther
freshman team.

When the record is written in black
and white, Coach “Skip” Gougler‘s
boys are credited with two wins, one
tie, and one defeat, inferring that the
team had only a fair season. But the
season, if looked at from a personal
contact view, was much more than
fair. In fact, it was a highly success-
ful season. Even if the record
could have been improved, Coach
Sutherland of the varsity can‘ be
certain that the players coming to the
varsity next year are players that have
been taught some football, and who
own a never-give-up spirit_

In the ﬁrst game of the season, the
Panther Cubs trekked just across the
hollow to whip the Carnegie Tech
plebes, 12-0. In this game the Pitt.
frosh showed that they possessed pow-
er and a real backﬁeld man in Bill Sta-

pulis. Stapulis tossed a pass to Shaw,
early in the ﬁrst quarter, for the ﬁrst‘

touchdown and later, in the ﬁnal pe-
riod, ran 23 yards for the other Pan-
ther touchdown.

The ﬁrst year Med teams are
the Golombs, Phi Bets, and Nu
Sigs. Dead Beets and Slaphap-
pies represent the second-year
men. Each team will play four
games. The winner will be de-
termined on the basis. of 1.000.

On Tuesday, the Golombs out-
played the Phi Bets to score of a
14-6 victory. At the same time,
the Nu Sigs nosed out the Dead
Beets 12-6 on the Practice Field.

VERY
IN THE TWENTY-THIRD
 DYNASTY. WHICH WAS ,
. TANITE. on ,\/E5 3155,

The following week the little Pan-
thers journeyed to Saltsburg to take
on Kiski. Before the game, the Pitt
frosh loomed as huge favorites to win,
since the Tech plebes had previously
defeated the Kiski eleven, 18-0. But
when the battle was over Kiski sport-
ed 13 points while the Panther Cubs
had to be content with nothing more
than the trip to Saltsburg. The
game marked the ﬁrst time that Kiski
had been on the long end of the score
this season, although the Little Pan-
thers did make it an interesting aft-
ernoon, driving twice in the last quar-
ter to the Kiski 10-yard line, only to
ﬁnd the necessary ﬁnal punch lacking.

At Morgantown, two weeks later,
the Pitt team played a tie, 14-14, with
the West Virginia freshmen, after a
thrilling, story-like comeback in the
ﬁnal quarter. West Virginia led, 14-0,
up until that time, In the fourth quar-
ter, the little Panthers drove 50 yards
for their first score, with Stapulis ﬁn-
ally taking it over. Nine minutes
later Urban intercepted a Mountain-
eer pass and romped 88 yards for the
second touchdown. Souchak, regular
end, booted both extra points, assuring
at least a tie game.

As the climax to a thus far only av-
erage season, the Panther -Cubs trav-
eled to State ‘College and atoned for
their early season mistakes by deci-
sively whipping an undefeated and
conﬁdent Penn State frosh team, 13-0.
For the ﬁrst time during the season,
the team clicked together both offen-
sively and defensively. Again Bill
Stapulis walked off the ﬁeld wearing
the laurels. Time and time again he
would rip through the line, or sweep

around the ends for long gains. The

Pitt team scored ﬁrst in the middle of
the initial quarter when Patrick dove
across the goal from the 3-yard line,
after the Panthers had made a sus-
taned drive from the 50-yard line to
the three. The second score came late
in ﬁnal quarter when Stapulis threw
a 20-yard pass to Souchak, who raced
17 more yards for the touchdown.

For the major of the season the team
that started the games lined up with
Frank Souchak and Walt Miller at
ends, Ted Schmidt and George D.
Delich at tackles, Lou Richards and
George Yokas at guards, II-Ienry
Adams and ;Don Hensley alternating
at center, John Michelosen at quarter,
Bill Stapulis and John Urban at half-
back, and Frank Patrick and Bill
Dwyer alternating at the fullback
post. Paul Shaw, end, and Tony
Matisi, guard, were in the regular line-
up at the start of the season but were
forced out on account of injuries.

Other members of the squad that
contributed to the team’s success
were: Eddie Spotovitch, Ted Huish,
George Musuli.n, Dan Dilaconi, Bob
Daufenbach, John Rose, Bill Mc!Clos-
ky, Bob Silverman, Al Walton, Jack
Kelleher, Jfoe Morrow, Russ Steele,
Dan Dalle Tezze, Buck Herzog, Paul
Studt, Albert Barr, Dave Freed, and
Robert Delaval. The freshman man-
ager for the team was August Iurlano.

The Retort Courteous

After the Pitt-Navy game last Saturday, the
Panther cross-country men, who had watched
the game following their meet with the Navy
1'1mne!‘S. Went over to Baltimore. Their inten-
tions were to go from there to New York for
the IC4A meet.

As one carload was driving along with
Coach Olson, Baltimore came into view and
Olson began a search for the Pennsylvania
station. Having little success, Olson spotted
a cop on a corner and drove up to the fellow.
Rolling down the car window, Olson boomed
out to the copper, “I want to go to the Penn-
sylvania station.”

The copper looked the coach over for a
second, shifted his quid of tobacco in his
mouth, and replied, “All right, go ahead.”

What would life be without these stories
about policemen?

Pi K A’s Defeat
Kappa Sigs, 6-0

Pi Kappa Alpha advanced to the
semi-ﬁnal round at the expense of
Kappa Sigma in a 6-0 touch football
game on Wednesday. The Pi K A’s
scored late in the ﬁnal period on an
end-around sleeper play. First downs
stood 1-0, Kappa Sigma.

Long punts by McMunn kept the
Pi K A’s completely bottled up the
ﬁrst half, An interception and pen-
alty twice placed the Kappa Sigs
within scoring distance, but they
failed to have the punch to push it
over the last white line.

With but four minutes to go, Teats
took the ball from center and started
around left end. He took just two
steps and fumbled the ball. Recover-
ing, he spied George, his teammate,
running toward the goal line after
blocking the Kappa Sig end. He
whirled and looped a high, wobbly
pass to George who was free on the
‘two-yard stripe. McMunn tagged the
receiver just as he was crossing the
goal line, too late to prevent a score.
The place kick for extra point was
bad. Great and McMunn of Kappa
Sigma spent the remainder of the
game vainly attempting to score on
long passes and wide end sweeps.

The Tuesday game between Phi
Kappa and Phi Delta Theta was de-
clared no contest in the middle of the
third period with score tied 0-0 in
points and 1-1 in ﬁrst downs. Furrie,
of the Phi Kappa, sustained torn
muscles in the right leg when he
faded back to pass midway in the
third quarter. He was carried from
the ﬁeld and treated by Dr. Kowallis
at the stadium. Both teams agreed
at this time to pla.y the game over on
Saturday at 2:00 p. m.

House Established '

A clearing house for campus
musical talent is the function of the

pointed by Margaret Doescher, Ed35,
president of Women’s choral. A sug-
gestion of Dr. Lotte Lohstoeter, as-
sistant professor of modern langu-
ages, made at the choral banquet last

spring resulted in the establishment
of the committee.

According to Miss Doescher, the
ﬁrst duty will be scouting the cam-
pus to locate all personss who have
talent which is not being utilized at
present. This will include vocal and
instrumental talent of both men and
women,

The committee will then offer its
ﬁndings to all campus organizations
who wish to secure musical entertain-
ers.

Plans for sponsoring an hour of
group singing at Heinz House will
also be considered by the committee.

Dr. Lohstoeter; Mrs_ Robert Ayars,
director of the choral; Miss Helen
Rush, assistant dean of women; and
Miss Doescher will work with the
committee which includes Amelia
Braun, C37; Elinor Beight, BA37;
Roslyn Burnat, C35; Rosemary Grime,
C37 ; Bernadine Kittell, C35; Ola Mc-
Grail, Ed36; Jane Kahler, C37; Jean
Kulcycki, C37; Jane Lentz, C35; Vir-
ginia Luckhardt, Ed36; Jeanne Mac-
Masters, C37; and Kathryn Markley,
