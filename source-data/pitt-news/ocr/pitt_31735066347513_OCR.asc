  NewNyden.ReviewDenied  

BY BILL MOORE

Rejecting the recommendation by
the Faculty of Arts and Sciences
Tenure and Promotion Hearing
Board (TPHB) to appoint another
committee to review the case of
assistant sociology professor Paul
Nyden, FAS Dean Jerome Rosen-
berg has sustained his earlier
decision to dismiss the Marxist
scholar at the end of the current
school term.

Nyden, after receiving Rosen-
berg’s nine’-page opinion yester-
day, said he was “amazed,” and

expressed hope the TPHB members .

wouldshare his disapproval.
Rosenberg justiﬁed his decision
not to convene an ad hoc committee
by quoting portions of the TPHB
report which supported the socio-

' logy department’s decision last year

not to renew Nyden’s teaching
contract. “The ﬁndings of TPHB
itself that reasonable grounds for
the stated cause. for non-renewal——_
Dr. Nyden’s inadequacy as a
scholar in the ﬁeld of Sociology-
exist in fact rule out the need for an
ad hoc committee,” Rosenberg
wrote. i
Nyden, however, accused the
FAS dean of “very selectively
quoting the report.”
“It was a mixed report, but I felt
in many ways it favored me more

than the department,” Nyden said. '

He said he had already spoken to
one member of the TPHB who was
“_disturbed” by Rosenberg’s deci-
sion. .

Although the TPHB did not say in
their report that political motives
deﬁnitely did or did not play‘ a part
in Nyden’s dismissal, Rosenberg
said in his response that the failure
of the TPHB. to “make an
affirmative conﬁrmation” of Ny-
den’s charges showed that Nyden
had “failed in his appeal.”

New GPSA
Chairperson
Elected p

The Graduate Professional Stu-
dent Association (GPSA) unani-
mously elected Steve Williams,
representative from the Graduate
School of Public and International
Affairs, as GPSA chairp.erson.

Williams will take ofﬁce on
March 1, succeeding current
chairperson Sandra DeBourelando.

‘.‘ The role of the chairperson is to

happen. GPSA is going through a
large amount of change which I
want to watch, not get involved in,”
Williams said. A
Williams, who intends to main-
tain GP_SA’s “current level,” says
his major concern will" be the
 University's» state _funding._ 1

  

" the facu

Rosenberg rejected two major
objections of the TPHB to the
sociology department’s original
vote not to renew Nyden’s contract.

The TPHB had criticized the
department’s negative review of
Nyden’s work because it followed
by only 15 months a favorable
review by the same department.

_ Rosenberg rejected that criticism,

and said it was not “unreasonable”
for opinions to change in that
amount of time, and that the FAS
had recodiﬁed its procedures for
reappointment during the period
between the two reviews.

Rosenberg also rejected the
opinion of the TPHB that the
department had made “scarcely a
single substantive statement” con-
cerning the revised version of
Nyden’s dissertation.

In a cover letter to Nyden,
Rosenberg invited him to ask
Chancellor Wesley Posvar to
appoint yet another hearing board,
the next step__,,,,in. the,_of-ﬁcial
University appeal procedures.

Nyden, however, said he would
not do that immediately, and would

Discrimination Charged.

At Pitt Bias

BY RON NYSWANER

f

Professor Ottie Andrius, formerly
a faculty member of the School of
Dental Medicine, charged the
University of Pittsburgh with
“drastic sex discrimination" and
“character assassination” in Wed-
nesday’s public hearing on discrim-
inatory practices at Pitt.

Andrius was one of ﬁve people
who testiﬁed at the hearing during
its session concerning Pitt's alleged
sexist practices. Testimony was
also given on alleged anti-union and
unfair labor practices, political
repression and racism at Pitt.

The discrimination hearing was
sponsored by the Student Commit-
tee to Defend Paul Nyden.

Andrius, who has ﬁled a class
action suit against Pitt, based her
charges of sex discrimination on her
removal from the School of Dental
Medicine, the manner of that

Law Grads Get Gown Option

BY DEANNA LOUISE

Some Pitt Law School students
will don the traditional graduation
regalia their predecessors waived in
recent years due to a controversial
garb option instituted by the
school’s dean, Edward Sell.

The decision, for some, to wear
the cap and gown on May 28

A" followed a statement by Sell that ‘ ‘it

would be an interesting and
desirable experiment to resume the
traditional practice for the 1977
ceremonies.’ ’

Since the class rejected the
regalia by a narrow margin during
two successive votes, Sell said
“under no circumstances should
any graduating senior feel compel-
led to wear an academic costume to
graduation.” Faculty, however,
must wear the cap and gown, Sell
said.

“About 60 percent of the class '
rejected the idea of wearing gowns
when we discovered the book store
would not rent them to us and we’d
have to buy them for $35,” class
vice-president Jeanine Arnold said.

“The second vote was on renting
the outﬁt elsewhere for $7.50,”
Arnold said. “That vote was
substantially even.” According to

makethe wishes ofthe organization 1 Sell’ the second V°te was 70'65

against the gowns, until “a few
people changed their minds and
some late votes came in” making

. the count 70-69 against. There are

approximately 185 members of the
1977 class. - .

When the first vote was taken at a
class meeting, Sell reportedly said
I Z lty would

 

  

honor the" wishes s

 
  
 
  

of the class in regard to wearing the
regalia.

With the virtually split class
opinion on the issue, Sell said, he

,The referendum would have
established six different areas each

sible for: ‘ﬁnancial, academic,

“The idea behind the referendum

was forced to carry.

Associate provost David Powers,
who was not at the hearing,
responded to the charges yester-

day. “Dr. Andrius had a hearing- ' - l‘
"before a board approved by the *

University Senate (and) composed
of professors elected to it,” and
that, after hearing Andrius’ char-

ges. “they spoke their view” and I i 

decided to terminate her employ-
ment. .

Andrius said she was given
tenure without promotion and
began employment with an annual
salary of $5,600 and 11 years later
was making only $5,900 per year.

Her charges of character assass-
ination stem from the University's
alleged compilation of a “confiden-
tial ﬁle" which she called a “secret
weapon. conﬁdential only to the
victim.”

Law School Graduates
To Get Gown Option

(Uontmued from Page 1)

“The law school student govern-
ment only asked the Dean not to
make his decision mandatory
because, no matter what, 50 percent
of the students would be angry,”
Arnold said.

Some students said they will wear
the regalia for tradition’s sake or to
please their .parents, while others
believe the special dress is a
frivolous expense. Advocates from
both sides generally agree their
stand is inconsequential in light of
the option’s outcome.

“If the dean told us at the

beginning we had to wear them,
nobody would have said much,"
one graduating law student said.
“What happened though, was that
we voted it down twice and now we
have to wear them anyway.”

“What are the guests going to
think of those students who aren't
wearing caps and gowns if others
are wearing them?” another
student asked. “Even those who
voted against it will be compelled to
wear them out of peer pressure and
a general sense of propriety. I can
just imagine my mother wondering
why I’m not wearing a cap and
gown.”

“We should mobilize the campus
about the share of money we receive

"71’ Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh "

  Short Changed Again  

, Governor Shapp’s budget, and the meager amount of funds it
allocates to the University of Pittsburgh, hammers the ﬁnal nail on the
lid of the coﬁin of the liberal image Shapp tried toproject.

For the second year in a row, the state legislature is being called upon
to bail out higher education in Pennsylvania as the govemor’s ﬁnancial

J 1 plans fall fatally short of the amount needed to maintain the vital signs of

state-related schools. _ _

One wonders how a budget that raises the gasoline tax two cents per
gallon and increases the sales tax from six to seven percent can cry
hardship because it was short on revenues.

So for the second straight year the Peimsylvania Higher Education
Assistance Agency has received no funding increase. For the fourth
year in a row student aid money for Pitt has remained at the same ﬁgure.

The Medical School has received no funding increase for the past six
years. The Chancellor has expressed ooncem about the future of quality
education there.

The general education appropriation increase was far short of what
was necessitated by cost increases and budget deﬁcits over the past few
years.

And the dental medicine clinic, a community service provided by Pitt,
is being eliminated—percentage points at a time.

How democratic a man can Shapp be if he willingly creates a situation
where dental clinics and rriedical schools will be reserved for the upper
class in a state-related institution?

There goes a chunk of the American Dream, and yet part of his budget
reserves $30 million for a boondoggle project like the Pocono Arts
Center.

Administrators and student leaders alike will be spending many a
night burning the midnight oil over a budget deﬁcit that will necessitate
wielding the ax onto many important projects.

The Pitt News calls upon state legislators, our area ones in particular,
to step in and save higher education from Governor Shapp’s budget.
They are the only people left with the power to do so.

court-appointed counsel (Gideon v.
Wainwright, 1963) and that coerced
confessions are inadmissible evi-
dence (Escobedo v. Illinois. 1964).

Then in 1966, the stage having
been set, Cheif Justice Earl Warren
unveiled a 20-odd page opinion in

Miranda v. Arizona that carefully

delineated the exact Constitutional
rights and guarantees of a criminal
defendant. e accused may
remain silent during interrogation,
he is to be afforded the presence of
counsel at every step of the
proceedings and he is to be
informed of his rights.

Today, many worry about the

continuing force of Miranda and its .

sibling decisions. Warren has been
off the bench for eight years,
William?O. Douglas retired in 1974
and to replace them we have such
Nixon appointees as- Justices
Warren Burger and Harry Black-
mum. The country as a whole has
shifted to the right.

In Michigan "v. Tucker (1974), the
defendant identiﬁed a witness
whose testimony proved incriminat-
ing because he was never informed
of his rights. . - Afﬁrining ‘the

conviction and sidestepping .Miran- ,

da. Justice William Rehnquist
noted that ,poli‘ce’men are fallible

human beings and emphasized that ‘

we “mu-st consider society’s

- interest in the effective prosecution

of criminals.”

Accused  

Such reasoning beﬁts Rehn-
quist’s political orientation. But he
is not wrong. If we are to talk of a
defendant’s rights, we must also
consider the rights of those he has
injured. A notable example is
Anthony Kiritsis’ abuse of the
mortgage company executive last
week. Aren’t we all being denied
our rights when the streets are
unsafe to walk at night? Say all that
you want about the failure of our
prison system and the injustices
afforded innocent defendants. It
remains that society, viewed as a
living organism, must protect itself
from those who would injure it.

Douglas said of Miranda that it
would have an “unsettling inﬂu-
en"ce” on policework; undoubtedly
it has disturbed the work of the
present Supreme Court. Unable to
retreat from the Miranda decision,
yet certainly fearing to overrule it,
the justices trod a case by case path,
wherein lies the real problem.

Ever since high school civics,

Americans have been schooled in
the belief that the Supreme Court
decides landmark cases—that it

always decides landmark cases, and ‘

that it only decides landmark cases.
It is a lighthouse piercing the fog on
the uncharted waters ahead with
the light of progressive truth.
Witness Gideon's reply to the
Florida judge that denied him an
attorney—“The United States
Supreme Court says I am entitled to
be represented by Counsel.”

But this is not to criticize. such

naivety as wrong or unrealistic. In ,'
fact, it is correct and quite healthy-. 
We are entitled to know the state-of _
the law in "this country. _ If "the _’

present Court in good faith truly
believes the Miranda holding is -a
practical impossibility, then it
should incorporate its judgment
into an equally deﬁnitive state-
ment. . . .. .

  Sound Out Prices

Before Audio Buy

BY DAVE MCDONALD

I Now that you know the audio
lingo and have in mind how much

you want to spend on a stereo _

system, the next step is to look
around for the best buys. To ﬁnd
good buys in stereo equipment,
check Consumer Reports and
Consumer Magazine lists for
recommended picks. If the same
brand and style was on both lists,
try to price it in stores.

For this article, the four audio
stores surveyed were AFC Elec-
tronics in East Liberty. The
Listening Post in Shadyside, Toyko-
Shapiro’s Audio Warehouse in
Oakland and Sound World in
With 26 components
surveyed. The Listening Post came
out on top for having the most, with
12. AFC was second (11), Toyko-
Shapiro third (9) and Sound World
had 5. This tells a little bit about
selection. AFC had the biggest
selection in turntables and receiv-
ers, Toyko-Shapiro has the most
offerings in loudspeakers and
cassette recorders. The Listening
Post had the largest selection in

. components.

reel-to-reel tape recorders, head-
phones and ampliﬁers. Sound
World didn't have too much
selection in much of anything.

All stores were helpful in quoting
prices and discussing the various
Toyko-Shapiro’s
salesman was particularly helpful in
showing his products and the best
components for certain price
ranges.

AFC had just about all prices
clearly marked, Toyko-Shapiro had
most prices marked, The Listening
Post had some prices posted and
Sound World had very few of its
audio products marked with prices.
It is much easier to shop when
prices are clearly marked.

It is hard to do a good price survey
in audio stores for the simple reason
that stores carry different brands
and none of the stores carry all the
same brands. But for the brands
that were carried by two of the
stores compared, there ususally
was a difference in price, some-
times as large as $40. So it does pay
to shop around.

As for the best picks in receivers
and their prices, this is the way it

went: Harmon Kardon 330c($189 at
AFC), Sherwood 7010($155- at AFC
and $179 at Toyko-Shapiro),
Kenwood 4600($270 at AFC'and
$300 at Sound World),
JR5525x ($297 at AFC), Pioneer
sx650 ($300 at Sound World),
Marantz 2275($559 at AFC).

.x.\‘.\\ .

JVC

Consumer Reports rated EPI 100

speakers as “best buys” and both
AFC and Toyko-Shapiro had them
for $89 each for vinyl cabinets and
$99 a piece with wood cabinets. The

EPI 200 was sold for $218 at
Toyko-Shapiro. AVID 102 speakers
were also “best buys,’ ’ according to
Consumer Reports, and they can be
yours for $250 a pair at the Listening
Post. If you really want to blast the
person living next door, a good pick
would be the JBL L100. They cost
$566 a pair at the Listening Post and
normally they are $589 a pair at
Sound World, but they will be on
sale there for $499 next week.

FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD

Ihnliilkmpﬂh i
i J :'....l  ‘

BY KEITH BRIAN

When the United States Supreme
Court ruled a state may enforce an
obscenity statute against sexually
oriented materials or works, it held
that local contemporary community
standards should be used to decide
what is prurient and offensive.

It was under this ruling that Larry
Flynt, publisher of Hustler maga-
zine, was found guilty of pandering
obscenity and engaging in organ-
ized crime in Hamilton County,
Ohio. This is the county in which
Cincinnati is located, and also
where Hustler magazine entered
the market in January, 1976. The
issue sold 7,000 copies, at $2.25
each. Hustler's distribution in the
Cincinnati area was stopped in July,
1976, when an indictment for
pandering obscenity and organized
crime was brought against Flynt;
his wife and co-publisher, Aletha
Flynt; his brother and co-editor,
Jimmy Flynt; and associate Al
Vanshrieker. All but Larry Flynt

' were acquitted. The publisher was

‘convicted and sentenced to seiven to

 ._.25. . years.«...in_.,prison. and I ﬁned,

  

’ $11,000:

   

. v‘ EA". 1977 $1.95

 
    

When asked why the other
defendants were found not guilty,
especially of the organized crime
charge, a spokesman from the
Hamilton'County prosecutors’ of-
fice said, “ask the jury.” Ohio
Statutes deﬁne organized crime to
be “whenever ﬁve or more people
conspire together and commit an act
of crime for proﬁt." Though
Hustler is not the only men's
magazine sold in Cincinnati, Flynt
was the only publisher tried. “He
was prosecuted because it was
against federal law," said the
spokesman. “I don't make the
laws, if you don't like the way the
law reads, write your legislator.
Everybody thinks this man was
arrested for putting out a magazine.
He was found guilty by a jury of 12
strangers for breaking a federal

‘ law."

In July. 1976. 22.600 issues of
Hustler were sold in the Cincinnati
area. From January to July. 78.600
“obscene" periodicals were sold.

Larry Flynt‘ (released on $55,000

bondpending appeal) contends his,
V . r.naga.zin._e. .dePi¢t.i.xig-mlde Women in

me_n)._, _Noreen Cor_mell,_._ said, “We .

    

erotic and explicit sexually available
positions, is not obscene. He said
he" believes other commercially
available magazines having photo-
graphs of people with thiir heads
split in half, eyes falling out and
dismembered babies are closer to
being obscene. , '

“There's damn little pretense
about ‘Soldier of Fortune’ (a
magazine designed for mercenar-
ies). lt’s about death, hate and
pain. There’s also damn little
pretense about the kind of erotica
found in the pages of Hustler,”
Flynt wrote in his January, 1976
“Publisher’s Statement.”

"There is much in Hustler that is
tasteless, but to prosecute a man
because his taste happens to differ
from yours or mine is far more
outrageous than anything publish-
ed by Larry Flynt. This conviction
should be protested by every
American who values his own
personal freedom ofexpression. For
as long as it is possible to arbitrarily
and capriciously limit one person's
expression, it remains possible to
limit the expression of us all,”
Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner
said.

Hustler. by its nature, is
considered degrading by many
women: therefore. it puts feminist
periodicals in a sticky situation.

Ms. magazine: “No Comment.”

Cosmopolitan: “No Comment."

BIC 980 and 960 come out on top. In I

the BIC 980 line prices varied very

little: at Toyko-Shapiro, $194; AFC,

$199; and Sound World-, $200. The
Dual 510 and 502 semi-automatic
turntables also rate very high with
consumer magazines. Toyko-Sha-
piro had the 510 for $179 andthe 502
for $188.

. The TEAC A400 came out tops in
cassette tape player-:. Its ‘price was
$295 at the Listening Post and $319
at Toyko-Shapiro. In high-priced
reel-to-reel decks the consumer
guides gave good marks to AKAI’s
6X63O ($995 at the Listening Post
and the TEAC 2300SD which was
$602, also at the Listening Post.

In ampliﬁers, Phase Linear had
some high ratings. The 4000 model
is sold for $600 at the Listening Post
and the 2000 model goes for $300 at
the same store. In power amps, the

Q Hollywood in Oakland

"1. Local Lab Re- Shoots Stars

*0

BY LESLEY SAYELL
About 30 persons swarmed
through the motion picture lab.
Some were developing “The French

. Connection, Part II” in one room.

Others frantically worked on
reprints of the original “King
Kong.” Lorne Greene came
through the main door and waved to
some employees as he entered the
sound studio with Jack Napor, the
lab’s president.
Hollywood, right?
New York? .
Try Semple Street...
The WRS (Warren R. Smith)
Motion Picture Laboratory on
Semple is the scene of motion
picture ﬁlm developing for a variety
of clients across the country:
Paramount, Columbia and Screen
Gems, to name a few. Columbia
Pictures contracted WI3A to dev-
elop additional prints of the old
“Three Stooges” and “Bewitched”
series. ’ '
“When the series is running on
television, there is one print made
that goes on network from either

Burbank?

New York or Los Angeles, where
they feed all the stations who
subscribe to it,” Napor explained.
“After that series goes off the air,
additional prints are made and
licensed to individual television
stations throughout the country,”
he said, “which is what we do.”

Three years ago WRS reprinted
the original “King Kong” movie
negative for the re-release of the
ﬁlm. This negative was restored for
the Library of Congress which is
another of their clients.

“Dennis the Menace,” “Bat-
man,” “Harry and Tonto” and
“Krazy Kat” have seen the insides
of the lab on Semple Street. All of
them were reprinted and distribu-
ted across the U.S.

“Mandigo,” “Murder on the
Orient Express” and “The War of
the Worlds” are Paramount ﬁlms
caption titled under a contract with
the Department of Health, Educa-
tion and Welfare (HEW). Caption
titling, which is much like
coordinating foreign subtitles on
ﬁlm, is done to beneﬁt the deaf.

another good power amp, the
Marantz 1060, for $189. If 1t’s an
integrated amp you’re looking for,
try. the Marantz 1150, which costs

$§20 at the Listening Post and $344
at AFC .(see, AFC can be undersold)

A good pick in a cartridge is the

t~‘-"*'shure M91ED, which is $19 at the

Listening Post and $30 at AFC.

In headphones the Listening Post
had the largest selection. Good
picks in headphones at the
Listening Post went to the AKI 240
for $69 and the Sennheiser 400 for
$30. As for special package deals,

As for special package deals,
AFC combined the Harmon Kardon
330c, the EPI 100s and the BIC 980
turntable with a Shure 91ED
cartridge all for $516. Toyko-Sha-
piro combined the EPI 2005, the
Sherwood S7210 and the BIC 960 for

$769.

When you do go shopping or
decide to buy, there are certain
things you look or watch out for.
One thing to look out for is- sales.
Stereo components are always
going on sale. If you are interested

. in a particular brand ask the

salesperson if that brand will be
going on sale in the near future. It is
also a good idea to check discount
stores for good buys in name
brands, sometimes you can get
good discounts. Another thing to
check before buying is the warranty
on the component. Most warranties
run for a minimum of 90 days while
others extend for one full year or
even longer. Also check the store’s
return policy. Your system may

sound good in the store but it may ‘

be a different story when you get it
home.

“As part of their ‘ﬁlms for the
deaf’ program, HEW requested our
caption titling,” Napor said. The
dialogue of’a ﬁnished ﬁlm is written
in white letters boxed within a black
border to make it easier to read.

Black shadow captioning is
“something only one other outﬁt in
the country has," Napor said.
“Other countries lack the techno-
logy to reproduce this captioning.”

Also, ﬁlm can be edited, sound
tracks cut and narration and music
can be coordinated with a film at the

WRS sound studio. Lorne Greene,
WTAE television‘ broadcaster Paul
Long, the Vogues and jazz musician
Harold Betters have either narrated
or recorded music before WRS
microphones. ‘

Locally, WRS has processed

some of Pitt’s medical department’s
films.

“It’s an unusual business for this
area,” Napor said of the 24-year-old
lab. “It just happens that the
business started here and we
developed it here and fortunately,
we were able to attract enough
business from out of town to make it
work.”

So much business that when a
studio like Screen Gems calls it a
day, the Semple Street lab goes to
work. -

It doesn’t seem to be the same

Pittsburgh annual Associated Art-
ists Show was a boost to our town's
low aesthetic morale. This year's
show, though hung in the same
Museum of Art gallery space.
captures but a faint echo of the
previous show’s excitement.

The exhibition in the Heinz

Galleries is tired and lean of robust‘

works with many pushing little
beyond classroom exercises.
Happily, Pitt is represented with
a few good pieces. Three studio arts
professors and two graduate
students entered the exhibition and
though their works, like the show
tend to be low-keyed, most are
good—-standing solid under scru-
tiny. -
Graduate art student Mildred
Cohen won the Jury Recognition
Award for her rather somber-toned
but delicately executed realistic

acrylic, “The Wicker Chair.” She
pictures an unoccupied wicker
chair, a lamp behind it, with a veiw
of another sitting room as
background. Empty. All empty,
but with a ghostly sign of previous
activity portrayed by an open book

' laying on the ﬂoor.

The understatement of her work
is absorbing, the subtle shading of
expression is beautiful here.

Fellow graduate student Thomas
Lacey presents pure, simple beauty
in the softly curving marble
sculpture called, “Georgian Land-
scape.” Though chiseled from a
hard medium, his femininely-
rounded form belies its material,
seeming as softly shaped and
pliable as if wedged in porcelain.

Done in the style of 1950’s
modern art, therefore not innova-
tive completely, it captures utmost
simplicity and beauty, with an
appreciable depth of feeling. A

Wings Over America
Capitol Records

The live album has crawled from
rather humble beginnings to be the
popularly acclaimed form it is to
listeners of rock music.

Take any poor quality recording
--tinny vocals and the musical
richness of a transister radio—and
add to that some intermittent
applause and hoots. some flubbed
lines or witty ad libs by the star, and
you had a record on which the
performer’s music was captured
amid the alleged “freshness” of a
live concert. ,

So then, what makes a great live
album? Good song selection, tracks

that are enhanced by the live _

atmosphere, songs that are revised

. or improved upon sincethe original

 

advantage of being at least based on
fact.

“Damned” concerns a little
known incident just prior to the
outbreak of World War II. A ship
with nearly 1,000 Jewish refugees
escaping Nazi Germany ﬁnds itself
refused entry to any free ports-
including the United States. With
fuel and supplies running short, the

studio cut.

How could a guy with a name like
McCartney go wrong then? By
trying very, very hard.

His hand has been steadily
improving, and though I’ve never
heard the former Beatle in person,
he's acquired quite a reputation as a
live performer. “Wings Over
America,” a two-and-a-half-hour,
three-record set, was reportedly
culled from some 30 hours of

concert tape, quite a nip, and tuck .

splice job.

With that much known, we could
expect a first-rate live rocker. Not
so.
Wings plays faithful reproduction
after faithful reproduction, which
satisﬁes the concert-goer who’s just
paid $10 or $20 for a ticket, yet
disappoints the stereo junkie who’s
got every song on other albums. and
yet hears, no ,signiﬁcant difference

past year subdued her usually
active canvas into almost minimalist
surfaces.

In her painting entitled “White”
she presents viewers with just that.
Her surface is white, with only
slightly relief blocks and swirls of
«directional movement activating
‘her plane.

Floyd usually does serial paint-
ings which depend on an interaction
between one another to complete
her statements. It is unfortunate
that the judges only included one in
her series submitted for this show,
because the viewer gets a sense of
unﬁnishedness in her work. All in
all though, “White” is beautifully
quieting, almost as if the artist has

lain a blanket of stillness over light

activity. _
Studio arts professor Warner
Wada also implemented changes in
his familiar oily-squiggles-on-
metal-surfaces works. In “Variable.
Angle Construction,” he reduces
his painting surface to that of the
frame area, rather than the space it
encloses. Moving off the gallery
wall and onto the ﬂoor, “Construc-
tion" is a wooden sculpture that

looks like a barn-yard gate without
the customary ‘X’ that blocks off the
middle area of the wooden frame.
In short, he is left with a large
wooden frame that is empty in the
middle.

The work is confusing. At times.
when its rough material forces the
association (barn-yard gate) too

vividly, the piece seems to lose any ,‘

aesthetic fullness.
Wada incorporates an intriguing
fullness of space within the angle
his pieces cut. In fact, his painting
scribbles around the frame, espec-
ially the angularly running strip of A
blackness running along the frame
that seems to ﬂoat in a dimension of
its own". i

I’m confused by Paul Glabicki’s
“Flight,” also. But here, it’s_
because the studio arts instructors’
work seems to incorporate too many
images that ‘make my eyes tired
looking at them, without jelling into
a congruent, uniﬁed statement.

“Flight” is a multi-medium
collage of feathers, paint and paper.
The images repeated are symbols of
flight—birds,, airplanes, etc.——in
different mediums. Usually,
Glabicki’s works synthesize into a

ship begins its return to Germany—-
with concentration camps, at best
awaiting its passengers.

The ﬁlm looks at the many
personalities involved, including
both the political machinations
making this mess possible and the
private traumas of the people. The
latter, of course, makes up the bulk
of the movie, which occasionally
gets bogged down in soap opera,
but still some interesting character
studies emerge.

Primarily, “Damned” is a story
of how people cowed into behaving
like trapped animals ﬁnd their
humanness again as the possibility
of freedom becomes more and more
certain, and then how they react
when this hope is threatened. At
the beginning of the ﬁlm—and the
voyage—the passengers’ behaviors
range from anxious to neurotic to
near-catatonic.

Some, like Dr. Kreisler and his
wife (Oskar Werner and Faye
Dunaway), speak bitterly and
somewhat ironically about lost

in the live version.

Another, even more glaring, fault
of the package is that the tracks
cover McCartney’s last three
albums heavily and offer little else.
“Venus and Mars/Rock Show” is
blasted beautifully and its absence
would leave a sorry gap, but what
justifies the plastic given to ‘ ‘Spirits
of Ancient Egypt,” “Bluebird,”
“Magneto and Titanium Man" and
“You Gave Me the Answer?”

Alive McCartney record would
seem to‘ promise fantastic versions
of “Tomorrow,” “Smile Away,”
“Too Many People,” “Big Barn
Bed” and “I985” that would turn
up.

The only things McCartney
touches from the old stuff in this set
is “Maybe 3 I'm Amazed” (a

torturous rendition—my favorite):

and “My Love” (which « in
retrospect is onljrabouti midway

positions and the Germans mad-
ness. And there’s Carl Rosen (Sam
Wanamaker), ready for a nervous
breakdown any minute, as his wife
(Lee Grant, who won a deserved
Oscar nomination for the role) tries
to hole the pieces together. Finally,
at the nadir, are the concentration
camp refugees like Aaron Pozner
(Paul Koslo), who are so fearful they
cannot even make a choice from the
dinner menu and will not make a
whimper to defend themselves or
their friends from attack.

As the ship gets closer to Cuba,
where all on board are promised
landing permits, lives begin to
mend. Married couples begin to
behave like, well, married couples

and even-the camp victims find they —

can raise their heads and speak in
almost normal tones.

Of course, the audience knows
that the trip-is simply a propaganda
tool and a cover forgan espionage
mission. Knowing that no nation
would take in these refugees, Nazi
Germany planned it so that no

through his solo career).

Some of the better cuts are
Beatles tunes, as one would expect.
“I've Just Seen a Face” is more
bristling, “Lady Madonna” is more
ﬁerce, “The I.ong and Winding
Road” is more sorrowful and
“Yesterday”-—well, what can you
say about “Yesterday?”

It’s not all spoonfed, though. A
couple of surprises turn up, like
Danny Laine singing “Go Now,"
the first Moody Blues hit (he sang it
then, too); the old protest staple,
“Richard Cory,” done in a Dylan
parody; and “Soili,” a new
McCartney rocker that deserves
some studio polishing.

—The album's not bad. It’s

surprisingly full for a live record. It V

just does no service to the claim on
freshness that live music has and
will always have, whether done by
former Beatles or the Taylor-Allder-

   

country could complain about the
necessity and methods-of dealing
with these people.

Much of the political action
concerns Cuba, where a combina-
tion of corruption and political
ﬁnagling keeps the passengers
from disembarking. The story here
sometimes gets confused, as

“all-stars” (Orson Welles, Jose

.Ferrer, James Mason. Katharine
Ross, Fernando Rey, Ben Gazzara
et al.) come out of the woodwork to
tug and pull over the fate of the
passengers.

The feeling we are given is that
Cuba isn’t the most honest country
around and, since that government
(1939) is gone, it’s an easy enough
cheap shot. A little more about why
the U.S. ‘ likewise refused the
refugees entry would have put more _
meat on that side of the story, but
the ﬁlm glosses over the American
role in the incident.

Besides the huge international
cast, which includes Max von
Sydow as the ship's captain torn

McDowell as the captain's steward
in an occasionally overdone subplot,

“Damned” has taken great pains to
present authenticity, even to the
point of clothing the women in silk
or rayon stockings (nylon was later)
and the correct hats of May, 1939
fashion. Costumes alone for the
huge cast (the screen is always
well-peopled) must have been
considerable, since the clothes for
even the extras drip of authenticity.

Probably the most memorable
scene is Lee Grant’s. With all her
fragile hopes dashed to despair, she
decides to _“punish" herself by
cutting her hair, in anticipation of
the shaved head at the concentra-
tion camp.

“Voyage of the Damned” is a

Return of the Disaster Film

/Continued from Page 8)
the incident really happened, and
is ﬁnally being told—and told quite
well—makes for a solid, commercial
but thought-provoking movie.

The Cassandra Crossing
Directed by George Cosmatos

“The Cassandra Crossing” is
likewise commerical, and it at-
tempts to be thought-provoking,
but it doesn’t have the advantage of
history to let us forgive its sins.

It’s a contemporary tale, but
evokes much of the horror of
Nazism—not as a temporary

ginsanity that found its place in

ﬂ

.‘

history, but as an ongoing
phenomenon that allows what;
amounts to mass murder under the
excuse, “I was only following
orders.”

For some reason, a couple of
terrorists (or pacifists, depending
upon your definition) plant a bomb
in“ the U.S. sector of the
International Health : Organization
in,Geneva. While trying to escape,
they break into a lab. and are

accidentally doused with a deadly

serum, contracting a. man-made
plague. One of the terrorists is
captured and dies quickly from the
new disease. The other man
escapes and boards a train carrying

. about 1,000, all potential victims.

Needless to say, the disease
spreads, no cure is known and the
train is sealed—at Nuremberg, no
less, as if the Nazi symbolism
wasn't heavy enough already. The
passengers are to be sent to an

’ ~ '~U.“isolation camp” (read: old concen-

{O

Q.

tration camp) in Poland. To get
there they must go over the
Cassandra‘ Crossing, a rickety old
bridge not used since the end of
World War II. The people who lived
near it moved away long ago,

because they feared its imminent
collapse.

Looking at the bridge, one would
hesitate to let a chicken walk across
it, not to mention a fully loaded
train. But orders say the train must
go, so...

In case anyone wonders, Cassan-
dra was the famous Trojan princess
who could, and did, foretell events
with deadly accuracy—but no one
ever believed her (thus Troy fell).
Although doom is predicted con-
cerning the bridge, no one—or at

least not the right people—believes_

1t.

Unlike “Damned,” “Crossing”
is pure disaster movie, with
irrelevant subplots, black-and-
white characters and clear delinea-
tions of the good guys and the bad
guys. In this corner is Burt
Lancaster, the gruff American “just
following orders. ’ ’ The good doctor
rebuking him and the U.S. for germ
warfare, among other things, is
Ingrid Thulin, stuck in that
well-known role of concerned but

helpless observer.

On the train, there just happens
to be an eminent doctor, played by
Richard Harris, who enjoys requir-
ed romantic subplot with Sophia
Loren as his twice-estranged wife.
Ava Gardner is less ridiculous than
her “Earthquake” days, again as
a pampered, sex-starved matron,
Martin Sheen is badly used as her
lover and someone, somewhere,
had the bright idea of putting in O.
J. Simpson under the delusion that
he could act at least in ﬂuff. He
gives ﬂuff a bad name.

As expected, there’s an old
Jewish man, victim of the very
concentration camp to which the
train is heading. There are also the
expected small children (necessary
for added pathos) and young lovers.

The characters, and characteriza-
tions, are shallow and too many of
the process shots look cheap. While
the subplot of Harris and Loren at
least seems interesting, too many of
the others have no bearing on the
plot, making for a splintered story.

Recruiting Crop Reaped

BY CRIS HALL

Pitt football coach Jackie Sherrill
has signed at least 26 potential
Panthers—leaving him only four
NCAA-sanctioned vacancies—but
still spent last night scouringithe
South for signed letters of intent.

While the names of 26 ballplayers
were gradually spreading through
Pittsburgh, Sherrill and two assis-
tants—defensive coordinator

1, Jimmy Johnson and offensive line

coach Don Boyce——were reported to
be visiting both Georgia and
Mississippi in pursuit of at least two
players.

Atlanta's attraction for Sherrill is
quarterback Carlton Williamson,
while Mississippi’s draw is defen-
sive back Phil Freightman, who was
erroneously reported in yesterday's
Pittsburgh Press .as having signed
with Pitt.

Both players are among the group
that “should make up the final
four,” according to a source close to
thesituation. Meanwhile, however,
“26 letters of intent are either in
this office or in the pocket of
someone who's headed here,” a
spokesman from Pitt’s sports
information office said last night.

running back touted by scouts as

Batch Bocci Idea?

BY STEVE SYBERT

The water polo team made it, and the Hockey Club has been
struggling for five years, so just what are the chances of bocci
(pronounced boch’ee) ever becoming a varsity sport at Pitt?

Offhand, not too good. /j

At a university where King Football takes so much precedence that
the baseball team several years ago had to play a number of games with
only one ball,you have to wonder if the athletic department would dig
deep enough to come up with the dough to buy the nine required balls for
bocci. L ,

Rekindled on the Pitt campus by Casanova and star athelte Giuseppi
Ajinnapeppi, a direct descendant of Cristopher Columbus, and his
roommate Francesco, the shoemaker, bocci is an ancient game
originating from northwestern Italy and southeastern France.
Ajinnapeppi himself starred as a youth in the “Little ltaly” sectionof
New York City.

“l’ma gonna do to bocci whata Anthony Dorsetti dida to footaball here
at Pitta,” Ajinnapeppi bragged at a recent practice session at the Italian
nationality room.

Though Ajinnapeppi has yet to take his demands to Athletic Director
Casimir Myslinski, a non-Italian, he said he is not asking for an
expensive rink as is the Hockey Club, but only a two-million dollar Bocci
House with 20 alleys and a mora room. ‘

In Ajinnapeppi’s long-range plans is the staging of the world bocci
championship in Pittsburgh for the first time since the initial event was
held in Genoa, Italy in 1951. - .

But the outspoken Italian’s dream may never come true. Sure football
is getting the most attention in the athletic department circle—as you
might expect for the national champions—and basketball is close
behind. Admittedly, football and basketball are the top money-making
sports at Pitt, but the minor sports are suffering in spite of that.

Football, for instance, can offer as many as 30 full scholarships every
season, while men's gymnastics can offer about two and a half
scholarships every four years. In another contrast, Pitt hockey players
pay to play and represent the University on the ice. And the icers have
yet to suffer a losing season.

What Pitt needs is a Robin Hood within the athletic department-—
someone to “take from the rich and give to the poor” among the various
sports. Yet four years ago, it seems with the case of the lone baseball,
the opposite action began to hold true. For another example, according
to a source,'the Panther track program lost one of its lanes in the Field

House because ofa high athletic department official’s wanting ‘to center R

the new basketball floor.

With those kinds of decisions it seems impossible that a varsity hockey
team, or bocci team for.that matter, would ever be recognized at Pitt. It
was surprising that the water polo team gained recognition during their
last season, but of course there already was a pool for them. \

Ajinnapeppi is a fictional character. But if he were real and was
indeed trying to form a varsity bocci team at Pitt, it would not be worth
his while—there would be too much prejudice against minor sports in

the athletic department hierarchy to get that first jack (target ball) in
motion.

Pitt’s athletic department should not rest on its football laurels, but

should strive to build the entire athletic program uniformly. as in theory _

is its real purpose.

Also included in those committed

to Pitt are: defensive back Lynn
Thomas of Pascagoula, Miss.,
Rooster Jones’ hometown; North
Natchez, Miss. linebacker Hugh
Green; Portage, Pa. fullback Mike
Chobany; Baldwin fullback Wayne
DeBartola; 6-5, 240-pound Altoona

back Terry White.

Also announced were: 6-3 Pea-

Trocano; 6-2, 220-pound linebacker
Hugh Green of Natchez, Miss.; 6-3,
255-pound Scranton lineman Jeff
Boyarski; and Mt. Lebanon defen-
sive lineman Steve Tate.

A source said last night that
Sherrill was particularly concerned
with signing Williamson, the
Atlanta quarterback. “Jackie really

wants him,” admitted a Pitt
spokesman, “he’s an excellent
athlete.”

As for Rooster Jones, he was
doing his own talking. “I can’t
count how many schools have told
me I'm one of the best in the
country,”_he said last night. “Ijust
want to be myse1f———but I want to be
known like Tony Dorsett and have a
chance at the Heisman Trophy.”

Pitt was to learn last night
whether Artrell Hawkins, a record-_
breaking back at Johnstown High
School who has spent the past two
years at a Kansas junior college,
would enroll here, according to la
realiable source. Also, 6-2,

Field House Scene  ‘
Panthers- Lions Catfight 

Pitt’s 4-18 basketball Panthers
will entertain Penn State's Nittany
Lions tomorrow evening (8 p.m.
tipoff) at the Field House. Pitt is
winless in Eastern Collegiate
Basketball League (ECBL) play,
holding down last place in the ECBL
Western Division with an 0-8 league
record, and is the only team behind
third-place Penn State.

Larry Harris’ recent scoring

spree has been one blessing coach
Tim Grgurich is hoping will

continue. The 6-6 junior forward
has scored an average of almost 31
points per game in Pitt’s last five
outings. His last two performances
have yielded 35 points against
Duquesne and 38 points at
Maryland.

Sonny Lewis, suspended at
Maryland because of tardiness at a
practice session, should play
tomorrow night, as should Mike
Rice, who is nursing a dislocated
little finger on his left hand.

Snapping the cord at an incredible pace in the last several games,
Panther forward Larry Harris [24], shown in action in Pitt’s upset of
Cincinnati February 2, will try to keep it going tomorrow night versus

Penn State.

Gannon Lumbers to Pitt    

BY JIM PANE

The Pitt Hockey Club (10-3-1)
travels to Erie today to square off
against Gannon (12-6) in a 7:30 p.m.
game that could refresh many
hostile memories. I ,

The literal had blood that exists
between the two teams dates back
to their last encounter two seasons
ago at the Alpine Arena. Pitt was
cruising along with a 4-0 second‘-
periodglead when tempers ﬂared
and ofﬁcials lost control of the
game.

“Gannon put a lot of lumber on
our guys,” Pitt coach Len

Barcalow recalled. “You just can’t
stand around and let them belt you
over the head, so a few heavy ones
were thrown back at them.” '

The trouble began when former
Panther defenseman Russ Stump
found himself on the short end of _a
Gannon stick, leaving the defense-
man with several teeth loosened.
Retaliationon the part of Pitt led to

further outbreaks by both teams;

with the climax coming at 11:48 of
the second frame when Gannon
coach Bruce Kravis, who has since
transfered to Atlanta, grabbed a
referee by the shirt.

Kravis’ action apparently pushed

Pitt’s last two roadtrips, will take his hot streak to Erie tonight when the

Barcalow is making no predic-

When track coach Mike Agostin-
ella realized that Chuck Mozingo,
p3Nick Martin and Rich Markley had
“graduated _and that Don Betterly
was ﬁnished running due to
injuries, he ﬁgured he had better
recruit some half-milers. But the
problem with recruiting is that it
takes time for a freshman to develop

A good half-miler is essential to a
team that wants to have any

q,

BY JIM LEWIS
Q

When you fall off a horse, the best
thing to do isjump right back on. At
least Pitt wrestling coach Dave

Adams thinks so.

‘‘ Adams’ team lost a29-15 decision
‘ to battling Navy at the Field House
last Saturday and host ninth-ranked
Eastern Wrestling -League (EWL)
Rival Penn State (10-1) tomorrow at
After. losing by such a
margin last week, one would think
the Panthers would be saddle-shy."

2 p.m.

But such is not the case.

“I would like to think we always
have a chance to win,” Adams
stated conﬁdently. “We always try

to give it our best shot.”

 A “best shot” is what Pitt will

need to make theﬁnal score close.

The Nittany Lions, coming off an
18-17 victory over fourth-ranked
Lehigh (aiteam that wallopped the
Panthers, 41-3), are a shoo-in this
season for their third-straight EWL

— title.

Despite throwing some of their

best scores of the season, the .

members of the Pitt bowling team

again learned the strength of the

competition in the Western Penn-
sylvania Intercollegiate Bowling
League as they placed 13th of 16 in
theleague tournament at Beaver
\_ Community. College last Saturday.
The ﬁrst three-game set of the
nine-game tourney saw the Pan-
thers at their most donsistent form

9’to date. Led by sophomore captain

Geoff Joseph's 599, and with good

support from freshmen Mark».

Suekoff, Rich Louden, Mark
Randall and Kevin Fleischood, the
youthful _team’s 2,582 pin total was
good for only 11th place.
Reflecting the inconsistency
which has plagued them this
season, the Pitt bowlers’ perfor-
~"mance fell off in the second set

 

Despite his team’s disal 4-_l8 record, a win over rival Penn, State‘

respectable relay squads. The
880-yard runner is the backbone of
the sprint medley relay and an
integral part of both the two-mile
and the distance medley relays.
Since Agostinella waited until

1976 to bring in any good half-mile ‘

talent, he didn't expect his relay
crews to come of age for at least
another year. But one runner’
Agostinella overlooked in his search
was Rich Moore.

Just a sophomore, Moore sur-

Pitt, meanwhile, looks headed for
the glue factory, having lost ﬁve in a
row the last ‘month. As far as
consistency in performance goes,
the Panthers (5-5) are stranded at
the gate.

“Our biggest problem is that we
get a good performance out of one
guy, but not the others,” Adams
conﬁrmed. “We must have
consistent performances all the
way downthe line.’’

And the grapplers are training for A

that consistency.
“We’re sort of gearing our

practices for tournament‘competi- g

tion,” Adams explained. “We’re
working on situations, moves and a
lot of- Weight training.”

But it will take a lot more than
that to defeat ‘the thoroughbred

- Lions. Almost ‘all of the Penn State

starters have winning records,

’ compared to the three winners Pitt

has—Skip Bolinc (167 pounds)‘, Bill
Bailey‘ (190) and Mark Stepanoyich
(heavyweight).

- , Bowlers Unlucky

their sub-par 2,344 pushing them
even further behind the league’_s
powerhouses. During this set, Pitt
shared a pair of lanes with
Montgomery College, the eventual
tourney winner, whose second set

_ _ score was 2,629.

Perhaps the most discouraging
aspect of the day for Pitt was the
realization that, even at their best,
they are a long way from the top at
their present stage. The 2,582 they
threw in the first set was
realistically the best that can be
expected from them, yet a look at
this year's match scores shows that
2,582 in every three-game match
might put the Panthers at the
mediocre .500 mark. _

Still, the team members take
hope in the fact that each of them
will be returning for another two or
three years,
development is largely a matter of
theirown dedication to the sport.

prised fans, teammates and himself
with a 1252.8 half-mile in last year's
Pitt Outdoor Invitational track
meet.

"Before that race my best time in
the 880-yard was 1:56 at the West
Virginia Relays three weeks be-
fore," Moore explained. “The last
time I had run the half-mile
outdoors before that was in high
school when I ran a 1:58.8."

Moore's progress was also a
delightful surprise to Agostinella.

Grapplers Spurred On

p 1 he best bout of the day should be

at 190, where Bailey, the Panther
co-captain, goes up against State's
Bill Bertrand. Both wrestlers
visited Tuscon, Arizona, last year
for the NCAA Championships.

But that’s not to say other
matches will be a one-horse race.
The 118 bout between freshmen Bill
Clark (Pitt) and unbeaten Mike
DeAugustino should be quite
interesting. *

“DeAugustino has done a
fantastic job as a freshman,”
Adams_admired. “We tried getting
him here—he lives in nearby North
Allegheny.”

Others starting for Pitt are Jose
Martinez (126), Steve Carter (134),
Kim Smith (142), Kevin McNamara
(150), Jim Gordon (158) and either
Rich Kostka or Don Amdt (177).

Can the Panthers upset heralded
Penn State?

- “We’re going to try our best,”

Adams answered.

But is that good enough to cause a
photo-ﬁnish?

13th

Perhaps in an effort to serve notice
on the rest of the league of their
determination, the bowlers saved
their best- single-game score of the
day for last, a solid 911, which is the
kind of production needed all the
time for a winning program.

Pitt’s next match is with Beaver
on Friday at 3 p.m. at Strand Lanes.
The bowlers will need to be at their
best—-or even better, since Beaver
is led by Mark Evrette, a pro-caliber
lane-burner whose nine-game total
in the tournament was well over
1,800.

‘Cal, Quarterback
In Cancer Batﬂe

SAN FRANCISCO (AP)—The
University of California’s Joe Roth,
one of college football's top
quarterbacks the past two seasons,
was ﬁghting his battle against
cancer Thursday as ° patient at the
University of California Medical
Center here.

Roth. 21, entered the hospital a
week ago Wednesday for further
treatments.

He had a malignant growth
removed from his neck three years
ago when he was attending
Grossmont Junior College near San
Diego. and early last month it was
revealed that Roth was again
afﬂicted with cancer.

The Cal star. who passed for more
than 3,500 yards in his two seasons
with the Bears. began receiving
chemotherapy treatments soon
after the recurrence was detected
late in the 1976 football season. He
was unable to play in the Shrine
East-West Game on Jan. 2 but did
play in the Hula Bowl and Japan

Bowl g_a_ll-star games,  _. _. .

 

“I was surprised by his time, but I
knew he had it in him,” he said.
“Rich had run in the sub—ﬁfties for
the 440-yard run before the
Invitational, so I knew he _had the
speed—all he needed was the
strength.”

Tom Herrmann will be one of the
four runners who will try to qualify
the Pitt distance medley relay squad
for the NCAA ﬁnals when the
Panther tracksters attend the
Central Collegiate Conference meet
this weekend in Ann Arbor,
Michigan. '

ge Runner

Moore has been getting plenty of
strength work recently, prior to the
indoor season. Along with the rest
of the half-milers, he has been
running much more distance than in
years past. It seems Moore has
beneﬁted from the longer distance
workouts, along with the strength
work on the track, for he ran a 1:53.6
in last month's Pitt Indoor
Invitational.

“l have been pleased with my
progress thus far this year,” he,
claimed. “I have more conﬁdence
to run with the big names since I
have more background work.”

Assistant coach Dan Sullivan
echoed the fact that Moore has
deﬁnitely gained conﬁdence along
with the progress he’s been
making. '

“Rich is beginning to realize he
can run with the big boys, ’ ’ Sullivan
said. “He won’t be ﬁnding himself
surprised when a 1:50 half-miler
like Pat Rextroat (Penn State) is

near him at the ﬁnish (which is what . .

happened at the indoor invita-
tional)."

Moore and the rest of the squad
are traveling to Ann Arbor,
Michigan, to compete in the
two-day, 51st annual Central
Collegiate Conference meet at the
University of‘ Michigan tomorrow
and Sunday. Moore and the rest of
the distance medley relay squad-
quarter-miler Willie Walker, three-
quarter-miler Tom Herrmann and
miler Mel Boyd-—will be shooting to
qualify for the NCAA Indoor
Championships.

Women Tracksters Not
Dover- Looked at Invite

BY MARIA SCIULLO

NEWARK, Del.—The Panther-
ette track team competed in last
Sunday's University of Delaware
Invitational and came away with
some helpful experience in the area
of pack-running.

Delaware has a beautiful indoor
track complex, but it seems that
somewhere along the line, they
neglected to mark lanes all the way
around the track. As a result, any
race longer than 60 yards was run by
having the athletes cut in toward the
edge of the track as quickly as
possible. Therefore, it came as no
surprise when more than a few
runners were jostled, elbowed,
spiked or forced to break stride.

Pitt's Marie Ribik and Karen
Krichko found the high jump pit to
their liking and finished second and
third with 5'6” and 5’4”, respect-

ively.

The team's second-best showing
was turned in by the 880-yard relay
of Pam Shaw, Sue Lewis, Krichko
and Janice Irwin. Their time was
1:49.8, good enough for fourth,
overall.

Two Pantherette individuals were
ﬁfth in their events: Carmen
Scherich (shot put, 33’2‘/2”), _and
Lewis (60-yard hurdles, 8.8).
Irwin’s 400 time of 61.6 tied her for
sixth place with Cordy Ingram of
Temple and Minnie McPhotter of
East Carolina.

Tomorrow the squad will run
against rival Slippery Rock in a dual
meet on the Rockets'_ home track.‘
