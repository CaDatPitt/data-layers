Senior Staff Writer

Students enrolled in a
-medieval art and architec-
ture class at Pitt can now
study the floor plans and
history of the Chartres
Cathedral in France without
going near a $50-plus text-
book.

And high school students
thinking about attending
Pitt can taste the university
atmosphere without coming
close to Pittsburgh.

While travelling on the
Internet, speakers at yester-
day’s Founders Day»
Symposium showed how
students can stop at a site
that lets them browse
through layers of images
that guide students through
the Chartres Cathedral —
and to another site that
shows a short video high-
lighting the different facets
of Pittsburgh.

The Internet’s multi-
media talents have trans-
formed the way teachers
teach and the way students
learn, said James Williams,

goes on
the road

By Jennifer McGinnis
Staff Writer

How did you spend this
past weekend? Watch a little
TV? -Do some studying?
Members of Pitt’s Student
Environmental Action
Coalition traveled almost
eight hours this weekend to
give Bill Clinton and Newt
Gingrich mandates.

SEAC was one of over
1,000 student groups repre-
sented at the “Free The
Planet Emergency Campus
Environmental Conference”
in Philadelphia. -

The conference was meant
to help organize student
activists for Earth Day, held
on April 22, and to encour-
age students to abandon cor-

 

professor and department
chair of Information
Science at Pitt. '

“It’s changed the way we

ing and solving problems,”
he said.

Before the Internet invad-
ed the classroom, a student
learned by ..“passive absorp-
tion.” By connecting to the
Internet, a student can learn

go about researching, think- ,

by “dynamic participation
and apprenticeship,”
Williams said."

The old teacher-student
relationship held the teacher
as omnipotent, whereas in a
class that uses the Internet
as a teaching tool, the
teacher assumes the role of
coach and advisor, he said;

Three Pitt faculty mem-
bers displayed the results of

their experiments with elec-
tronic teaching techniques
at the Symposium. Graduate
student Jane Vadnal told of
her conversation with pro-
fessor Alison Stones a year
ago, when they discussed
the limitations that tradi-
tional teaching methods

impose in their art classes.

SGB attends student government convention

By Nathan Hughes
Staﬂ Writer

Members of the Student Government
Board spent three days at Texas A&M

University discussing student—related-prob-V

lems with other student government mem-
bers from various universities.

The retreat was sponsored by the
Conference On Student Government
Association and is in its 15th year. SGB
President Julie Crowell, board member Julie
Clouse and Allocations chairperson Heather
Davis represented Pitt.

The meetings took the form of daily work-
shops that consisted of roundtable discus-
sions regarding problems and concerns made
by the students of the various universities.

“It was more of a give-and-take talk group,
where we were giving other universities
information about Pitt, and we were taking
infonnation that they gave us to adapt to our
university,” said Clouse. .

One of the major themes was student apa-
thy as it relates to student government.

“We have some ideas now ’on ways to
make our student government more visible

to the student body,”_ Clouse stated. ,_

For example, after spring break, Clouse
and Crowell plan to walk around Eddie’s
Cafeteria, introducing themselves to the stu-
dents as well as ﬁelding any questions stu-
dents may have. ‘.‘We’ll just go around hap-
hazardly, introducing ourselves to every-
body, and get their input through that,” said
Clouse. ’ ' A

There were also~a number of speakers who
spoke primarily on topics such as motiva-
tron. '

“There were just ‘some really, really won-
derful speakers that got you motivated, and
made you realize what your purpose was,”
said Crowell.

Both Crowell and Clouse were pleased
with the results of the retreat.

“It [the retreat] was very beneficial and
educational and extremely motivating,” said
Clouse.

“It was absolutely incredible —. the
resources you are able to pool from all the
other student leaders around the country,”
Crowell stated.

Board member John Capriotti stated that
the SGB radio talk show will premier March

16, the Thursday after Spring Break.

During the open ﬂoor, James Zambroski, a
Pitt student, expressed his dissatisfaction
with some of the language used in various
articles dealing withsexual assault at Pitt in
The Pitt News. '

“I strongly object to the ‘graphic, anatomi-
cally correct description of what was done to
the victim of the assaults,” stated Zambroski.

He went. on to provide an extended argu-
ment on why the type of language in ques-
tion is unnecessary.

“The language contributes nothing to the
telling -of the" story and creates a tone that is
cheap, unprofessional and distinctly unwor-
thy. of a major university daily,” Zambroski
added. _ _ ,

He then asked‘ the SGB to make a strong
statement concerning the quality of language
being used in The Pitt News. _

Crowell said that a statement will be made
after spring break regarding the whole issue.

“We don’t have jurisdiction or authority
over The Pitt News, but if it’s something the
student body is having problems with, we do
have to attempt to rectify the situation,” said
Crowell.

Steelers nutritionist Bonci teaches at Pitt

By Nicole Walz
Staff Writer

Maybe, just maybe, if the
Pittsburgh Steelers would
have had a better breakfast
the morning of their playoff
game against the San Diego
Chargers, the Steelers would
have won the game.

At least that is what Leslie
Bonci thinks. Bonci is a reg-
istered dietitian and the
nutrition consultant for the
Steelers. She is also the out-
patient coordinator for the
University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center.

Her work with the Steelers
began in April 1993, when
she was hired to counsel one
player so that he could lose
some weight.

“I think they were putting
me to the test and saying,

‘What can she do?’ It was‘

very successful, he ‘did very
well, and he lost the weight,”
Bonci said. “So I met with
trainers and the strength
coaches, and we‘ sat down
and mapped out a plan and
said this is what we would
like to see happen.”

Since then, she has devel-
oped on— and off-season pro-
grams and lectured at train-
ing camp.

Bonci is available to the
players during the entire sea-

son. Some players page her,

on the weekends and the
evenings with questions like,
‘‘If I eat this, will I play bet-
ter?” The coaches call when
the players are getting colds

and need to know what they.

should tell them to eat.

‘?My motto or my creed for
working with these guys is
the best athlete is the best

nourished athlete. There’s no

doubt about it,” she said.
Bonci also added that good
nutrition can help prevent

injuries and reduce sluggish- _

ness.

Bonci said there is a differ-
ent focus when working with
professional athletes than
with someone modifying a
diet because of illness.

Because of their size and
their amount of exercise, the
players need to consume
around 4,600 calories a day.
The average person needs
only 2,000—2,500 calories.

Bonci stressed not only the
importance of the calorie
intake, but what type, of
food, too.

“I think one ‘of the prob-
lems with professional ath-
letesin general are all the
misconceptions they’ve been
exposed to through their

tration exam to become a
dietitian. She called it “a
very crazy couple of years.”

Bonci also coordinated
outpatient work in Wheeling,
W.Va., at a cardiac and well-
ness center for two-and-a-
half years. When she became
pregnant with the first of her
two sons, she and her hus-
band, Fred, decided to return
to Pittsburgh, where Bonci is
from originally.

Bonci was offered a job at
a long-term care facility and

years of playing, where the
emphasis has been that one
should be eating a high pro-
tein diet,” Bonci said. “The
research certainly indicates
that the high carbohydrate
diet works better.” -

Bonci’s interest in nutrition
began in graduate school.
She received her undergradu-
ate degree in biopsychology
from Vassar College.

She was unsure what to do
with that degree, so she
entered the public health pro-
gram at the University of
Pittsburgh for her master’s
degree.

“As.I was taking the cours-
es, something about nutrition
was very intriguing to me,”
she said-

Bonci decided to take the
undergraduate requirements
for the clinical dietetics and
nutrition major while simul-
taneously working on a can-
cer research study.

When she was finished,
she held a six-month dietary
internship at Mercy Hospital
so she could take the regis-

“One -of my professors
said, ‘There’s an opening in
Falk Clinic. Are you interest-
ed?’” She was.

For nine years, she has

held the position as the out-
patient coordinator of nutri-
tion services for the medical
center.

She oversees the program
that counsels patients at

downtown and in Squirrel
Hill and anything that is
affiliated with the medical

patients about nutrition, this
was her first experience for-
mally teaching.

“I love it; being able to
teach students about nutri-
tion, because it is so impor-
tant to me and I think it is
important to everybody,” she
said. “Whether or not they
are going into this field,
[people] at least have an
understanding for the fact
that it is not so hard to eat
well.”

Bonci’s approach to teach-
i_ng is to make it fun and
enjoyable to learn. It seems

to be working. Many stu- I

dents have complimented her
on her style.

“She uses a lot of examples
like working with the
Steelers, which makes it
interesting,” said Lisa Adam,‘
a senior clinical dietetics and
nutrition major.

Bonci is interested in‘ edu-_

cating anyone who wants to
learn about nutrition. For
example, she is now devel-
oping a program for the play-
ers’ wives, because good
nutrition needs. to be the
whole family’s approach for
it to work for the players,
according to Bonci.

She will continue her work
with the players during the
year, preparing them for the
next season and stressing the
importance of their nutrition.

“You can never say a good

thing too many times,” she
said.
V As a faithful fan, she will

are eating right, so that
maybe, just maybe, the
Steelers will win the Super

nity,” Curry said. “It’s meant .

to encourage action.”

The conference featured
speakers from many national
environmental groups,
including Barbara Dudley,
executive director of
Greenpeace USA, and
Randy‘ Hayes, executive
director of the Rainforest
Action Network.

“Ralph Nader spoke, and it
was quite empowering,” said
Josh Knauer, a Carnegie-
Mellon student who belongs
to SEAC. “He said students
need to truly make a com-
mitment to being environ-
mentalists, not just in col-
lege, but all their lives. We
need to make it a career.”

Friday evening, during a

_panel of speakers, a group of

students took the stage and
organized a demonstration.
“We weren’t scheduled to
speak, but we did it any-
way,” said Curry, one of
three students from
Pittsburgh area schools to
gain the stage.

The students announced

plans to support a local com- ’

munity in a non-violent
demonstration against
Sunoco on Saturday. A
Sunoco owns two of the
five largest oil refineries in
the country, Curry said. One
of the plants is across from
housing projects in
Southwest Philadelphia and
has no emergency plan,
Curry said. Sunoco self-
reports that 60 percent of its
emissions are fugitive emis-
sions and are not regulated

at all, said Matt’ Peters of
SEAC.

“Eighty people showed up
to help plan [for the demon-
stration],” Curry said. “There
were people from as far as
Wisconsin and California.”
Students made banners and
prepared a street theater skit
in which the earth confronts
Sunocu officials and ‘con-
sumers. “Peacekeepers” were
trained to deal with the police
and make sure that nobody
got out of hand during the
demonstration.

On Saturday, between 800
and 1,000 students gathered
at Drexel University and
marched into downtown
Philadelphia. Students held
banners that read “Sunoco is
poisoning the poor. Sunoco:
Environmental Racism” and
chanted “People united will
never be defeated.” As stu-
dent actors performed the
street theater, the crowd
chanted the word “guilty.”

“It was fantastic,” Peters
said. “We sent a really clear

message that the needs of the.

biosphere need to come
before the ‘needs of multina-
tional corporations and other
special interests.”

Kim Catanzano, a Pitt stu-
dent who participated in the
skit, saw the event as a confi-
dence-building_experience. “I
got up in front of all those
students, and I felt really

' strong doing that,” she said.

, On Saturday night Pitt stu-
dents held a benefit concert
for the Allegheny Defense
Project, an organization
which works to preserve
Allegheny National Forest.

Peters performed at the con— _

cert along with Pitt alumna
Candy Gruver. “We raised
almost $300 for the ADP and
created a lot"of awareness
about public land issues and
involvement,” Peters said.

A second demonstration
took place Sunday afternoon.
About 300 people turned out
to march from the University
of Pennsylvania to
Independence Park. After the
march, activists spoke about

the successes they have had,
including Pitt’s decision to

avoid the Mt. Graham tele-,

scope project last spring.

At this rally, a Student
Declaration of Environmental
Rights was issued.

The declaration demanded
such things as a biologically
diverse world and the right to
break laws that are unjust
with direct action and civil
disobedience. *

An environmental petition
was also drafted and signed
by all the students. The peti-
tion will be sent to Newt
Gingrich, and will ask for his
support on 25 environmental
issues.

“This weekend was a really

-good chance for a whole

bunch of students to realize
that they can become leaders
and take action themselves,”
said Catanzano.

“We as individuals can
change this world — that’s
what the weekendwas all
about”

ed to explore how Internet
resources could help. They
scanned over 600 images
onto the network from over
35 placesin France and sev-
eral in England.

They concentrated on the
Chartres cathedral in France
to see how far they could
stretch Internet resources. A
student who digs beyond the
introductory page can burrow
into more detailed images of
the early Gothic cathedral,
which contains artwork and
structures spanning the 11th
through the 13th centuries.

A student can study the
location of the cathedral by
clicking into maps and pic-
tures of the wheat field where
it sits.

Internet resources allow
teachers to “imitate the struc-
ture of knowledge itself,”
Vadnal said.

If students bump into terms
that they don’t know, such as

“lintel,” they can click on that“

word. Not only will a
description appear, but so
will a diagram with an arrow
pointing to a lintel.

Vadnal said she and Stones
wanted to use the visual qual-
ities of‘ the Internet pages
more than written words. In
art, ‘students should come to
their own conclusions about
structures by looking at them,
not just by reading about
someone else’s conclusions.

“You have to learn to look,’’
Vandal said. “We purposely
tried to keep the text down to
a very minimum.”

Not only can Internet
resources help enrich teach-
ing techniques, but they also
give writers a broader audi-
ence and stronger voice.

“Free speech is about who
has the press,” said Bruce
Dobler, a Pitt‘English associ-
ate professor. “And it looks
like we’re going to have a lot

V of free speech going on.”

the World Wide Web, one
facet of the Internet, can post
their fiction, poetry and other
work onto the network.

The World Wide Web is “a
gigantic engine for publish-
ing,” Dobler said. As a writer,
that is what attracted him to
the Internet, he said. Now, he
teaches a class in which stu-
dents learn to create their
own home page, as well as
translate publications such as
The Pitt News into electronic
format.

At the symposium, Dobler
clicked into information post-
ed on the network by'the
English Department. One Pitt
professor had written a poem
on the network and had
recorded her reading of the
poem. During Dobler’s pre-
sentation, the professor’s
voice read the poem to the
audience overthe World
Wide'Web.

Soon, the amount of traffic
on the World Wide Web will
exceed the entire voice com-
munications traffic.

“It’s meaningless to talk
about what’s after the
Internet,” said keynote speak-
er -Anthony Rutkowski, exec-
utive director of the Internet
Society. “It’s as useful as say-
ing‘, ‘What’s after the tele-
phone?”’

“In its ultimate extrapola-
tion, it’s the ultimateopen
society,” he said.

The Internet boasts rapid,
low-cost, large-scale informa-
tion sharing among people
regardless of their geographic
location. It has obliterated
geographic boundaries, he
said.

In 1990, less than 5,000
networks were connected to
the Internet in the United
States. Now, more than
45,000 are connected,
Rutkowski said. A network is
a system of computers con-
nected by communication
lines.

In January 1995, less’ than 5
million individual computers
were connected to the
Internet. Based on chartsthat
have traced the growth of
Internet usage over the past
decade, 100 million comput-
ers will hook onto the
Internet by the year 2000.

“There is arguably nothing
in human communications
that has grown
at those rates,” Rutkowski
said.

        
     
   

  Opinions  

No real progress

On Wednesday, America reached its 50th day under the
Republican Congress. This was, according to Newt Gingrich,
the midpoint of “that historic commitment to change our coun-
try.”

While the Republicans ﬂaunt their success in passing such
measures as the balanced budget amendment and the line-item
veto, to claim victory is premature. Ail those who would point
to these and other items as real accomplishments should remem-
ber that Newt and the rest of the amphibians have done little in
actual terms.

These measures have yet to pass in their current form through
the Senate. The Senate majority is not as cohesive as its inexpe-
rienced cohorts in the House. Gingrich and Bob Dole are not the
best of friends by all accounts, for example.

Even if this so-called progress moves throughout the Senate in
the form passed by the House of Representatives, it still has to
go to the president’s des‘k,While President Clinton as struck a
conciliatory note with Republicans in recent weeks, he will. not
rubber-stamp everything they send his way. The Republican
majority is not so largethat it can override his vetoes out of
hand. ,

Now, as we move into the second half of the GOP’s 100 days,
it is targeting social programs. These include everything from
assistance to homeless youth and veterans to school lunch pro-
grams.

According to The New York Times, the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting got away without any cuts this year, but will face
cuts in future years. Other departments, however, were not so
lucky.

The Republican cuts will eliminate $1.3 billion for the Low
Income Energy Assistance program, which helps the poor buy
fuel oil. Perhaps they will be able to justify higher defense bud-
gets for oil wars in the Gulf after this.

They want to replace the federal support for the school lunch
system with a lump sum of money awarded to the states. The
goal of this is to cut out layers of bureaucracy, according to
Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Bill Goodling. Yet the system
itself seems to work well.

These changes are either window dressing or attacks on
groups which are not politically viable. In their mad dash to pre-

- sent a front of balancing the budget, the Republicans have

removed social security, defense and national debt interest pay-
ments from consideration, according to the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette.

The GOP claims it is going after “burdens” to the American
people, yet they are usurping this country’s future by attacking
programs which help students and children and contributeto
the cultural life of this country.

As John Kenneth Galbraith said in a Feb. 6 editorial in The
New York Times, “Basically something is a burden when it is not
for the rich, not for the merely affluent, but for the poor.”

Webster never knew these definitions

 

 
  
  
   

ave found
that many
embers of

the left have lit-
‘ tle pet terms that
they spit out
every so often.
Many of them
are words, or at

Columnist least deﬁnitions,
Erika Mr. Webster
Kendra never even con-

templated"when

compiling his lexicon. So here is
a little list of some favorite liber-
al catch phrases, along with
what they are intended to mean.
(Keep in mind that these words
are not intended to mean what
the dictionary says they do.)

1. Ultra-conservative (inter-
changeable with Radical Right)
-— One who espouses two or
more conservative beliefs.
Liberals consider these people to
be worse than plain “conserva-
tives,” and some effort should be ‘
made to eliminate them. Have
you ever heard of “ultra-liber-_
al”? Rarely, if ever. The connota-
tion of “ tra” is inherently nega-
tive, therefore the prefix is
attached to people with conserv-
ative viewpoints in order to
make those people sound exces-
sive. Has anyone ever heard of a
“Radical Left”? No. Members of
the political left are referred to as
liberal “activists;” only conserv-
atives are “Radical.”

2. Religious Right (inter-
changeable with Christian
Fundamentalist)
Conservative who espouses one
or more religious beliefs. The
liberal left holds the First
Amendment close to his/her
heart, but free speech does not,
apparently, encompass religious
speech. The terms religious and
fundamental themselves do not
suggest a great amount of nega-
tivity, but the context in which
they are used strongly suggests
that religion should be consid-
ered bad.

3. Fascist (interchangeable
with Nazi) — Anyone who ﬁts
the description of terms 1, 2, 3 or

,4;thistermcanbeusedasasyn-y

onym .of “conservative.”
Historically, however, Fascism
was A based on National
Socialism. True Fascism encom-
passed such things as socialized
medicine (such as that pushed
by President Clinton and his lib-
eral cohorts) and mandates on
who would be employed (quotas
based on various categories, i.e.
affirmative action.) I don’t recall
the conservatives in our govem-
ment supporting nationalized
health care or quota systems for
hiring. So which side is really

closer to true Fascism? Not con- »

servatives.

4. Racist, Sexist and
Homophobic (all interchange-
able with Bigot) —- Label given
to anyone who does not feel the
need to give special privileges to
groups based on race, gender or
sexual preference. Liberals love
these words because they spark
anger almost immediately.
Anyone with white skin, specifi-
cally men, are automatically
given one of these labels until." it
is deemed that he has served a
sufficient penance for slavery,
colonialism and oppressing the
female gender. No attention is
paid to the fact that you (or even
your ancestors) had nothing to
do with slavery, colonialism or
oppressing the female gender.

5. Limbaughesque (inter-
changeable with Dittohead) —
Any person who espouses a con-
servative belief. It is assumed
that if a person espouses such a
belief, he or she does so only

because that person has listened

too much to Rush Limbaugh’s
show. The term is intended to
mean that a conservative belief
could not possibly be something
someone really believes, only
something we parrot. But has
anyone ever heard the term Dan
Ratheresque? or Ratherhead?
No. (Actually, this adjective
could be taken as a great compli-
ment, as one described by it is
associated with a man of
Limbaugh’s stature and tenaci-
W-)

6. Ignorant (also
Unenlightenedand

Uneducated) — This term is
used to describe anyone who
carmot be persuaded or indoctri-
nated into the liberal view.
Members of the liberal front take
the term “liberal arts” quite liter-
ally and feel the purpose of
schools is to “enlighten” every-
one as to their viewpoints.
Therefore, a person is consid-
ered “uneducated” if he or she
does not accept that goal of edu-
cation.

7. Politically Incorrect —
Anyone who refuses to comply
with set standards of speech or
belief. Members of the liberal
front often forget that the First
Amendment guarantees freedom
of speech. There is no sub-
clause to the amendment that
speciﬁes what speech is protect-
ed, just that freedom of speech is
guaranteed. The liberal interpre-
tation of the First Amendment is
what has created speech and
behavior codes on college
campuses, in public schools
and in public facilities. Political
correctness encompasses saying
and doing what the liberal
front dictates. The term, there-
fore, implies that opposition to
political correctness is really
opposition to America.
However, which more corre-
spondsrto the Constitution:
speech codes (liberal) or free
exchange of ideas (conserva-
tive)? L

Liberals continually embrace
the policy that “everyone is enti-
tled to his or her own opinion.”
The fact is, however, that they
believe everyone is entitled to
their opinion, as long as it agrees
with the politically correct, liber-
al opinion. If your opinion does
not agree with the liberalone,
‘you will most likely be lucky
enough to be given one of these
labels.

The point is, this is nothing
more than name-calling,
resorted to by liberals when they
run out of meaningful things to
say.

Erika Kendra is sick of political
name-calling.

Excuses

for home

coo/<i n ’
Thg1t’s the
number of
fans who
were in atten-
dance at
Saturday’s
final home
men’s bas-
ketball
game.

Most of us
know that a sellout at the
Field House is 6,798, and
in big games that number
rises as a large standing
room only crowd is packed
in, seemingly to the raft-
ers.

But Saturday was not a
big game, and the crowd
was 200 short, despite the
fact that it was senior recog-
nition day.

At other schools, anything
less than a sellout would be
an embarrassment.

Not here.

At least not anymore.

The basketball team is 8-
16 and is clearly not oneof
the top draws in town. But
these days, what sport can
be considered a top draw at
Pitt?

The old staple used to be
the football team. Anything
less than a bowl bid was
considered a disaster a few
years ago.

Now, it seems that there
are more opposing fans
at home games than Pitt
fans. .

Wins are few and far
between.

The days that we used to
contend with Penn State are
a distant memory. I’m one
person who didn’t cry when
they were left off our sched-
ule.

Getting smacked around
by West Virginia is enough
for me. .

I can also remember the
days when the.Charles
Smith-led basketball team
was one of the top teams in
the country.

In the 86-87 and 87-88 '
seasons, the men won two
consecutive Big East regular
season titles and got 24 and
25 wins as they were ranked
as high as second in the AP
poll.

It wasn’t that long ago
when every game at the
Field House was a sellout
and, more importantly, an
automatic win. I

But times change, and the
biggest thing to get excited
about this season is next
season.

And that’s how it’s been

Panthers stun 72-O Penn State en route to title

By Tom Schneider
Asst. Sports Editor

Thank goodness the mail-

‘man doesn’t deliver champi- _

onships.
If he did, Penn State would
have been accepting its tro-
phy about a day after joining
the league, which is right
about the time that it was
deemed invincible.
‘Unfortunately for the
Nittany Lions,'the West Penn
College Hockey Association
designated a sheet of ice on
-the IUP campus as the prov-
ing ground for greatness.
So it wasthat Penn State’s
incredible regular season run
' guaranteed little more than an
extra week of self-indulgence

before having its ego deﬂated .

by an underdog, underesti-
mated Pitt team.

The Panther hockey team
shocked the masses at Indiana
Ice Center on Saturday,
trouncing Penn State, the
league’s vaunted juggernaut,
in the semifinal round of the
WPCHA playoffs. A

Pitt followed up the
momentous victory over Penn
State with a shellacking of
host IUP in Sunday’s champi-
onship game, giving the

Gant doesn't disppoint in on farell

By Michael Kovak
Staff Writer 4

Nothing describes Chris Gant’s per-
formance Saturday against Providence
more appropriately than the old cliche
— save thebest for last.

Gant ended his Fitzgerald Field
House career with a career-high 21
points, while adding 14 rebounds and
four steals to his statistics.

“I tried not to think about this being
my last game,” Gant said. “The begin-

~ning was so emotional, it was hard to
stay focused.”

Staying focused seemed tobe the
least of Gant’s problems before- the
game. Lying ahead of him was the task
of guarding the Friars’ best player, Eric
Williams.

By the end of the first half, it was
clear that Gant came to dominate and
that Williams did not.

Gant, with the help of his front—line
buddies Jaime Peterson and Orlando
Antigua, shut down Williams on one of
five shooting, no rebounds and just
three points. '

Gant had eight points, seven rebounds
and two steals as Pitt jumped out to a
25-22 halftime lead.

“Chris, Orlando and Jaime did a great
job of stopping Williams,” head coac
Ralph Willard said. i

“I think people overlook us some-

times,” Gant said.

“They see all those little guys during
opening drills, and think they’ll kill
us.”

The second half continued the
same story for Gant. His defense
neutralized Williams. Williams went
zero-for-five from the ﬂoor in the sec-

nobody talked much about it.
We just did it.” i

_The Panthers thoroughly
dominated the weekend tour-
nament, trailing for a grand
total of under five minutes
while dispatching Allegheny
College, 9-4; Penn State, 6-4;
and IUP, 7-3.

What made Pitt’s remark-
able playoff run all the more
astounding was the "road
which the Panthers travelled
on their way to the throne.

Women '5 gymnastics finds solace in a thi

By Ed Ziegenfuss
Staff Writer

The women’s gymnastics team

may not have won the meet, but the
Lady Panthers scored 186.325, their
highest score i-n almost two years,
and the 10th highest score ever at
Pitt.
' “I was really excited for the kids,”
head coach Debbie Yohman said.
“These kids did not go there to
watch the other teams compete gym-
nastics.” .

The University of Massachusetts
won the meet with a score of
190.925. The host West Virginia
Lady Mountaineers finished second
(l90.725), and Pitt finished third.

In the all-around competition West
Virginia’s Kristin Quackenbush
,(39.250) took top spot, followed by
UMass’ J.J. Tolhurst (38.675) and
Tara Swartz (38.575). Pitt’s Brenda
Stevens (37.650) finished in seventh
place in the all-around competition.

Pitt began its day on the vault

where junior Michaelene» Myers had
the performance of her career and
.scored a 9.70. That score placed her

two more steals.

With the Panthers leading
40-27, Providence embarked
on a 7-0 run, and the
lead was down to 40-34
with 12:00 remaining in the
game.

It looked as if another
should-have-been win was
slipping away from Pitt.

After a missed shot
with 10:52 remaining, Gant
grabbed the rebound and
viciously dunked the ball to
end the Providence run. The
dunk succeeded in waking
up the 6,598 fans at the Field
House.

“Gant’s rebound was a
huge rebound,” Willard said
of the play. “It was probably
the turning point of the
game.”

Gant continued to clamp
down on Williams defensive-
ly, and the rest of the
Panthers kept feeding him
the ball on offense.

Over.the last 9:45, Gant
went to the line eight
times, making five, and his
inside play opened up
the shooting for the Pitt
guards.

“He played really well, a

 

I

really physical game,’
Peterson said. “I’m really
happy for him.”

The 6—foot—7 senior for-
ward from Houston, Texas
was averaging 9.6 points per
game and 7.5 rebounds for
the season.

“Chris has gone through
a little more than the
other kids this year,” Willard
said.‘

Willard was referring to
the stress fracture in Gant’s
foot that caused him to miss
the first five games of the
season.

“Since his return, he has
stepped up big time,”
Willard said.,

Gant, who scored Pitt’s
first and final points of
the game, said everything
was made more special
because this was his final
appearance at Fitzgerald
Field House. Plus, his par-
ents were able to see the
game. '

“I had a wonderful time
here at Pitt, and if I could, I
would do the same thin

over again.” 4

Willard said he would
gladly welcome Gant
back.

Every year, the
excuses mount. “We

“we’re young” or
“we’ve got a new

popular ones that have
been ﬂoating around.

pionship required three victo-
ries in three straight days -—
something Pitt was never
evenfaced with during the

regular season.

These three games, as it
turned out, would pit them
against two teams that had
each defeated the Panthers
earlier in the year (Allegheny
and IUP), as well as a Penn
State’ team that had barely
broken a sweat while rifling
through the WPCHA East.

Instead of succumbing to
the pressure and becoming
just another of Pitt’s postsea-
son ﬂops, this Panther squad
used the adversity as a spring-
board to success.

Panther co-captain and
leading scorer Bill Elliott
paired with Chris Bickell to
lead Pitt in the title clincher,
as Pitt jumped out to a 7-0
third-period lead before sur-
rendering three late goals.

The annihilation.of IUP
(which embarrassed Pitt. 12-4
toward the end of the_regu1ar
season) in its own house was
the perfect finishing touch to
a ﬂawless postseason.

However, the defining

I moment of Pitt’s 1994-95

campaign undoubtedly came
on Saturday night, when the
Panthers.pu11ed off the shock-
er of the year.

Penn State was among sev-

captain Steve Fisher said.
“This is championship hock-
ey. There are no easy games.”

“Penn State took us too
lightly,” Pitt head coach Dick
Rizzo said. “Coming in unde-
feated, they were a little
cocky. We just needed to play

At 4:19 of the period, a
Panther defensive breakdown
gave Penn State a two-on-one
break. Lion winger Brian
Martin led the rush down
right’ wing and wristed the
puck over Panther netminder
Dan Bratkovich to give Penn

“It’s an incredible feeling that is really hard to put into-words.

schools on a regular basis.
The team in the WPCHA is
made of players just waiting
to jump up to the bigclub.

As expected this season, the
Lions were in a class above
their WPCHA competition.
They finished with a regular
season record of 12-0, scoring
an average of 10.25 goals per
game, with an average victory
margin of just over eight
goals.

The playoffs were almost
inconsequential to these

The Panthers looked to set
the upset tone right from the
opening faceoff, as Pitt took
possession of the puck and
bombarded Penn State goal-
tender Brad Bujdos through-
out the first four minutes of
play.

Pitt kept the puck in the
offensive zone for almost that
entire length of time, pepper-
ing Bujdos with six shots,
almost all of which were
quality scoring chances.
Bujdos, however, was up to
the task and thwarted the
Panther onslaught.

State a 1-0 lead on its first
shot of the day.

“I was a little nervous when
we gave up that goal,” White
said. “That was just a simple
defensive slip, and they capi-
talized on it. Still, we were
getting our shots, so I knew
[the goals] would be there.”

Indeed, the Panthers would
finally find a way past
Bujdos, and it was WPCHA
playoff Most Valuable Player
Bill Elliott who got the train
rolling.

Just under five minutes
after the Martin goal, Elliott
caught the Lion defense

sleeping and snuck past cen-
ter red to accept a lead pass
from Carter Leonards, bear‘
down on Bujdos, deke once
and score behind the Lions’
befuddled goaltender to tie
the score at 1-1. ’

“After those first few shifts,
we really started to realize
that we could play with these
guys,” Elliott said. “We nor-
mally come out a little slug-
gish, but our whole team was
playing so hard  we felt we
could win the game.”

Pitt continued to add pres-
sure throughout the opening
frame, and with less then five
minutes remaining, had a 12-
3 edge in shots.

Elliott kept the train rolling

at 12:35 of the period when

he buried a perfect centering
pass from Travis Wills to give
Pitt its first lead of the day at
2-1.. .

Perhaps the most crucial
point in the game, and the
defining moment for Pitt’s
extraordinary penalty killing

unit, came with just under ‘

three minutes remaining in
the first.

After two Panther penalties
within a span of 26 seconds,
the Panthers found them-

selves shorthanded by two

men for 1:34 against the
deadliest scoring machine in
the WPCHA. A defensive
stand here could inexplicably
dictate the course of ‘the
game. Bratkovich would have
to stand on his head like he
never had before.

He didn’t need to.

The three-man penalty
killing unit kept the Lions so
busy trying to enter the Pitt
zone, and to control the puck
once they crossed the blue
line, that few shots ever fell

. on Bratkovich, who denied

every one.

Panther defenseman Ken
Anderson dominated those 94
seconds when the Panthers
held the key to their own fate.
Whether it was pinching the
play against the boards and
freeing the puck to a team-
mate or stopping the play at
center ice, Anderson con-
stantly found his way to the
puck.

His play, more than any-
thing else in those waning
moments of the opening peri-
od, set the real tone for a
Panther upset.

“Anytime you can kill off a
two—man advantage, it’s going

to give you a mental boost,”
Rizzo said. “It was certainly a
key point in the game.”

“We really started trading
blows [during the two—man
advantage],” Anderson said.
“We were pushing them back
and were able to deal with
their offense very well. We
just needed to stay disciplined
and keep our heads in the
game.” i '

At the onset of the second
period, it appeared for a while
as if the ice was tilted to one
end. The same goal the
Panthers were bombarding in
the first 17 minutes they were
now desperately trying to
defend from a rejuvenated
Penn State attack.

The Lions opened the peri-

. od with five straight shots on

goal, the last of which found
the back of the net at 4:02 to
tie the game at 2-2.

Penn State continued to add
pressure, swarming the
Panther net at every opportu-
nity, managing lO shots on
goal with over six minutes
left.

Bratkovich buckled down
after the tying goal and stood
up to the relentless Penn State
offense- His performance
against the Nittany Lions —

along with that of Pat Kenny,
who got the victories against
Allegheny and IUP — was
critical to Pitt’s postseason
success.

“In any league, you’ll only
go as far as your goaltending
can take you,” Fisher said.

Finally, with less than three
minutes remaining in a sec-
ond period dominated by the
Lions, the Panthers began to
regain control. After crossing
into Penn State territory and
keeping the puck in the zone
with excellent forechecking,
Pitt’s Brad Rizzo put
the Panthers back on top 3-2
with a goal at 14:13 of the
period. 0

With a huge upset in the
making, the Panthers knew at
the start of the third period
that they needed to give them-
selves some breathing room.

They didn’t have to wait
long, as Rizzo took a lead
pass from Elliott, moved in
and scored the goal that not
only gave the Panthers their
first two—goal lead, but also
broke the Lions’ backs.

Just’ 1:38 after the Rizzo
goal,.Pitt’s Leonards took the
puck near the left wing face-
off dot and whistled a slap-
shot over Bujdos’ stick hand

tomakeit5-2.
Elliott capped off the

Panther scoring with a short- ‘

handed breakaway goal to
complete his hat trick. Penn
State added two late goals to
make the final score closer
than the game was, but those
in attendance were notfooled.
They knew what they had

- SCCI1.

What they saw was a team
nobody expected to win by
less than 10 goals manhan-
dled by a team that got no
respect, even as they held
aloft the WPCHA champi-
onship trophy a day later.

Alas, none of that mattered
in the least after the final horn
sounded on Sunday and IUP’s
players declined to shake
hands with the team that had
bested them.

The Panthers and their fans

. understand and appreciate the _

magnitude of their accom-
plishments, and that’s all any-
one can ask for. .

As the WPCHA champions
paraded their trophy on
Sunday, they not only ended
years of personal frustration
for their senior players, but
also brought considerable
warmth to an otherwise cold
winter for Pitt sports.
