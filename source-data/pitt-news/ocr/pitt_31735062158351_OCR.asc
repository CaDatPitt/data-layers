2 Awards

Two national. scholarships
for college senior girls are of-
fered for 1959-60 by the Kath-

sonal and character qualiﬁcations,
ﬁnancial need, and potentialities

' for success in business.

Each college and university may

‘recommend two candidates, and

each candidate must have ‘this
oﬂ’icial endorsement. Students in-
terested in competing for one of

Hello again . . .

Thanks for the long chatty letter
A-it was almost as good as a visit!
Daddy says you've vastly improved;
it's such a pleasure to get some-
thing besides weather reports and
complaints about your allowance!
«I knew you'd love your Cellini
Bronze lipstick . . . but honestly,
dear, I don’t see how you can let
every girl in the house try it on!
If you think I’m going to buy you
another one, you're wasting your
blossoming epistolary‘ talents. ‘
Yes, of course Juliette Marglen
has a Nail Glacé to match—in fact,
I've just had the most gorgeous
manicure you ever saw! And who
do you think suggested it? Your
father! Soon as he ﬁnished read-
.ing your letter telling about the
sensation your Cellini Bronze Oval
Lipstick was, he asked me if I was
wearing it to the Country Club
dance this evening and wasn’t I
going to do my nails to match? This
from the man .who doesn't even
_know what colour my eyes are!
Now my nails look’ like sparkling
jewels- and with my new cham--
pagne chiffon and that metallic
Cellini Bronze lipstick, I’ll be 9.
dreamboat, as my darling daugh-
ter says.” _
. Please give me credit for 9.
motherly instinct or two; I did
want to send you some Cellini
Bronze Nail Glacé to matchyour
lipstick—‘but thought better of it.
Your nails are such a disgrace-
when are you going to do some-
thing about them?
I feel a lecture coming on_, so.I’ll
stop while I still have you. Every-
. one sends‘ love, in spite of your un-

glamorous nails, especially me . . .

Lions Break Game
Open With 2 Goals

In Third Quarter

By TED COLTON

Th_e Panther booters closed
out the 1958 soccer season at
Ellsworth Center Saturday ‘
when Penn ‘ State handed
them their seventh defeat by
by a 5 to 2 margin.

The Nittany Lions were sparked
by Gary Miller who tallied three
goals. The ﬁrst period went score-
less as both teams showed good
defensive strength.

Thén in the second period the
Lions took the leadwhen Miller
scored the ﬁrst of his goals to put
them ahead, 1-0. With about three
minutes remaining in the ﬁrst half
the Staters scored again on a goal
by Bill Rodgers.

The Pantherscame back early
in the third period when Bob-
Murdock sent a shot past the
Lion goalies to make the score,
2-1, with the Panthers still trail-
ing. '3

However, the rivals from State
College. were not to be "denied.
Jim Wadsworth and Miller scored
quickly for the Lions to put the
contest out of the reach of the
Panthers.

In the fourth period Chuck Kane
scored the Panthers second goal.
To round out the scoring Miller,
who was convertedfrom a full-
back earlier in the season, scored
his third goal. ‘

Leo Bemis, coachlof the Pan-
thers stated, “Our boys played a
good game and could have won
if they would have taken the_
shots instead of passing. How-
ever, the Lions have a ﬁneteam‘
and -we’ll be looking forward to
meeting them again next year.”

The Panthers ﬁnished the sea-
son with a record of three wins‘
and seven losses, while the Lions
ﬁnished with a record of ﬁve wins
-and four losses.. ’

event to open the Bicentennial

Six-man séjuads from the Pitt

legian will clash at Ellsworth Cen-
ter at 9:30 am. tomorrow morn-

“Blood Bowl” by the Panther’s
thirsty publicity director, Beano
Cook.

have been practicing quite faith- ‘
fully for their encounter with
the boys from State College.

Invitation to Gator Bowl  

Thanksgiving Meeting First In 28 Years;
Locals Still Plagued by Number of Injuries

By LARRY HAGGERTY

The Panthers will conclud

e their 1958 home football sea-

son tomorrow when they encounter the Nittany.Lion_s of
Penn’ State. The game, the 58th renewal of the traditional
rivalry between the two teamsfwill get under way at 1:30

p.m. before a Stadium crowd

.This time, however, may not be the Blue and Gold’s last --

of approximately 45,000.

contest of the year, for there is¢

still a slight chance that Coach
John Michelosen’s gridders may
wind up in the Gator Bowl in
Jacksonville, Fla., on Dec. 27.

The winner of ‘this battle can
also claim two other distinctions.
First, the victor will be the third

best team in Pennsylvania since
both elevens have lost to Syra-
cuse and Nebraska.j Syracuse an-‘
nexed the crown by beating Ne-
braska. '
. Cats Have Eldge

Second, the victorious team will
gain. possession of “Old Iron-
sides,” emblematic of the-mythi-
cal championship among, the
Panthers, Nittany Lions, and West
Virginia.~ Skyscraper U. has a
slight edge in that they defeated
the Mountaineers while the Lions
were held to a tie by the boys
from Morgantown.  .

Last Saturday’s results helped
to clear up the — cloudy bowl
situation ,for _i sgveral major
teams. Syracuse, by‘vi1-tue of
its 15-12 triumph over .VVest
Virginia, received and accepted
a bid to the Orange'Bowl where

they will meet powerful
Oklahoma. '
The . Air Force 9 Academy

trounced New ‘Mexico, 45-7, and
will probably be asked to provide
the opposition for TCU in the
while. Clemson’s
34-12 rout of Boston College will
no doubt put them into the Sugar
Bowl against LSU on Jan. 1.
Gator Bowl?

It appears then that’ the
Panthers still have a 50-50 chance
to meet either. a Southern or
Southwestern‘ team in the Gator
Bowl providing they can beat the
Lions of Coach Rip Engle.

If the Jungle Cats can tame
the boys from Centre County,
their ﬁnal record would be
6-3-1. The Panthers have de-
feated UCLA, Holy Cross, Min-
nesota, West Virginia, Notre»
Dame, and tied Army while B
losses were to Michigan State,

Long, Long ‘Season Finally Comes to Close

Thanksgiving Meaningful for Seers

Tomorrow is Thanksgiving, a
day to express thanks. And to-
morrow six Yogis_ will be doing
just that. They will be expressing
their thanks that 1) this is the
last week of thelfootball season,
and 2) this is the last ‘time this
year that they will have to select
these games, especially against
the, “expei"ts,” the Yogae.

It’s always a long season, but
the one concluding Saturday has
been extremely long, too long in
fact. Maybe next year, the Yogis
hope, there won’t be anyone

of having ‘women choose grid

the lines, you may, get the point."

x The rest of the 'Yogis have

agreed to elimina_te_,one Murray
Chass from the ranks. Because’ of
his weakne‘ss—-‘giving in to the de-
sires of women, the local prog-
nosticators have had many years
taken off their youthful lives.
As ‘could be expected, this
past week was no different
from any. of the other weeks '
‘since the Yogae started selects,
ing._ The individual Yogae were
only mediocre ’(that’s all they
are at anytime and in any-
thing), but‘ their consensus
somehow_ proved wiser- than
