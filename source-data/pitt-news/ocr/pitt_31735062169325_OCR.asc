(The following is an official University
statement by Joseph Colangelo, Director
of University News and Publications. The
issue of Mr. Langstaff’s ownership of
Your Campus Store. will be discussed
further in Friday’s edition of The Pitt
News.)

In its story on Monday, March 13, con-
cerning ownership of Your Campus Store
by Director of Auxiliary Enterprises John
Langstaff, the Pitt News left the mislead-
ing and totally erroneous impression that
his association with that business was ei-
ther unknown or unapproved by the Uni-
versity, or that he was able to gain some
advantage in his private "enterprises as a
result of his University position. This
simply is not so, and in leaving that im-
pression, the student newspaper may have

done both Mr. Langstaff and the Univer-

' sity an injustice. ' ‘

Mr. Langstaif’s investment in the Oak-
land business was long standing at the
time of his appointment as director of
Auxiliary Enterprises, and it was well
known to the University Administration.
Further, he has been scrupulous about
calling this matter to the attention of suc-
cessive administrations and about segre-
gating his private and his official Univer-'
sity activities. The fact that he insists on
receiving mail associated with his P1‘iVa'€e
business either at that business or at his
home rather than his University office,
for example, is an indication of the atten-
tion to detail with which, the administra-
tion has found, he keeps the two activities
separate.

Your Campus Store receives no pref-
erential treatment from the University,
in fact, there has been no occasion when
the University has had any dealing what-
soever with that enterprise. No Oakland
business holds an exclusive or preferen-
tial franchise to sell novelty items bear-
ing the University name or seal. Any
store owner may purchase these from
the suppliers who manufacture them with-
out payment to the University, and may
offer them for sale in competition with
the University Book Center or any other
business in the city.

Further, any statement to the contrary
no-twithstanding, Your Campus Store has
never purchased any discontinued or sur-
plus items from the Book Center.

The University’s own decision not to

  University Issues Statement On   Langstaff

stock a large variety of such novelty items 

in the University Book Center was made
prior to Mr. Langstaff’s appointment as
director of Auxiliary Enterprises and was
an academic, not a business decision. It
was the University’s feeling’ that such
items detract from the academic purposes
of the Book Center and take up space
that is better devoted to not highly com-
mercial, but academically extremely im-
portant items such as textbooks.

Thus, there has been no occasion, to
the administration’s knowledge, when Mr.
Langstaff has gained privately because of
his University affiliation, and when he
says there is absolutely no relationship
between his work at the University and
his ownership of Your Campus Store, he
is speaking the literal truth.

Political Science Professor -
Runs for County Treasurer

Political Science Professor
Edward  Cooke, whose
course in political parties re-
quires students to partici-
pate in campaigns, is taking
his own advice——-he is cur-
rently a candidate for Alle-
gheny County treasurer on
the Democratic ticket.

Dr. Cooke was recently en-
dorsed for treasurer on the offi-
cial Democratic county, slate
which will be 1‘ led by former
State Sen. ‘Leonard C. Staisey and
State Rep. Thomas Foerster, coun-
ty commissioner candidates. This
year, the Allegheny County Dem-
ocratic Policy Committee -refused
to nominate several incumbents
on the grounds that there were

younger and more qualiﬁed men
to -serve.

When asked to comment on
this development, Dr. Cooke re»-
plied, “I estimate our chances as
very good. Ours is a young, ag-
gressive, dynamic ticket, yet our
slate contains men who have had-
a wide variety of government ex-
perience. We’re bringing in new,
fresh ideas, new perspectives.”

Currently serving as the ﬁrst
Democratic mayor in Oakmont
Borough’s 77-year history, S Dr.
Cooke is also chairman of the
Oakmont Democratic Committee.
When asked why he decided to
run for wunty office this year,
Dr. Cooke answered, “I am in
the race because I feel that coun-
ty government is important and
becoming increasingly important.

In an interview after the con-

the misery of the American In-
dian today is her chief concern.
“The Indian’s legal rights, guan-
anteed in treaties signed by Pres-
idents, are being violated,” she
said‘. “Indian lands, such as those
of the Passamaquoddy tribe in
Maine, are being ilegally expro-
priated by state and local govern-
ments, which lease them to white
businessmen for proﬁt.”

According to Miss Sainte-Marie,
the Indians never receive reve-
nue from these lands, nor are the
records of such transactions open
to them.

“In other cases,” the artist
went on, “the government will
take over parts of Indian reser-
vations to build a road or a proj-

.ect such as the Kinzua dam. Yet

the Indians in many states can’:-,
even vote on these or any other
issues and are never repaid ado.
tluately. Nor are jobs provided
by these projects, for the con-
tractors bring in. white labor,
Therefore, in addition to Josing
their lands, the Indians become
unemployed.” _ ‘
According to Miss Sainte-Marie,
the end results of these actions
is incredible poverty for the In.
dians. “They're  literal-
ly Starving, and they’ve had no
help.‘ The Bureau of Indian Af-
fairs was established in the In,-
(Continued on Page 3,) ,

I think I have a few ideas to
contribute, and it is important
that people in the professional-
academic world, particuarly, par-
ticipate in local government.”

Dr. Cooke felt that “too often
the focus is on national and inter-
national events, and we tend to
overlook the problems of our 10-
cal communities.”

His decision to run for the post
of county treasurer was based on
the reason that “this is a pmi-
tion that no one has- a vested in-
terest in . The treasurer only
serves four years, there is no
incumbent, and it would force
me, if I were successful, to make
a further decision in four years.
I don’t want to get‘ into the rut
of holding public office for the
sake of holding public oﬁice.”

Dr. Cooke intends to keep his
affiliation with the University if
he is victorious and will teach

The answer to these problems,
Miss Sainte-Marie feels, must

come from the majority of Amer- '

sees students as being vital to
the Indians’ struggles. “The "rea-

the truth. They’re Willing to cri-
ticize when something is Wrong
with society rather than to deny
its existence as their parents
did.”

In Miss Saint-Mari-e’s opinion,
the current civil rights move-
ment cannot really help the In-

idian because, unlike the Negro,

the Indian could be economically
self-sufficient were government
treaty obligations honored. The
Negro, however, must contend
with irrational racial 
tion. She also feels that the Amer-
ican Indian does not want to be
integrated into white society, but
wishes to maintain his own cul-
ture without interference.

Miss SainteMarie said she hopes

that “once the public knows the
truth about the Indian situation

the government will be so em-

barrassed it will have to act.
“The things most important for

the Indians today,” she insisted,

“are that the government allevi-
ate the poverty it has ignored
for so long and that it honors its
treaty commitments. The oppres-
sion and exploitation of Ameri-
can Indians must be stopped.”

opinion on the matter was asked. Dr. Posvar’s reply in effect was that-
Pitt can still be a great.Universi'ty, even though it served the immediate
region. He reminded the students that it isn’t really so important to have
students from different states coming to the University. After all, he said,
9 how different is it to room with a person who comes from Cleveland
from rooming with a person who comes from Philadelphia. He seemed
to evade the “melting pot” principle which has been in the back of the
minds of the admissions officers of the top colleges of the nation for
several years. They believe that it is of value to have students from the.
backwoods of Montana, from the farms of Georgia, from Shaker Heights
and- from Watts all mixed up into the same freshman class. Also they
feel it imperative to attract students from all the continents of the world.
We have no doubts that the University will continue to attract

Editor, The Pittt’ News:

I have recently becom.e aware
of a practice of so-me ‘professor
in this University of allocating
the task of reading, evaluating
and grading student essays, to
beginning graduate stmdents in
the respective dep_artm,ents. Pro-

fessor Tobias’ excellent letter of _

March 1, 1967, regarding the pass-
fail option expressed some very
important attitudes, which I
quote. He says, “A student sub-

share this feeling with him.

For a serious student, essay as-
signments provide the opportun-
ity to practice the -art of think-
ing clearly through hours of in-
dependent thought, organization
and revision. He has every right
to expect and demand that his
efforts receive “a thorough pro-
fessional evaluation” requiring
“energy and drive” from his in-
structor.

The same dilemma facing the
dedicated professor subjected! to
the pass-fail system, confronts

Letters to the Editor

is about to announce s-ome faculty appointments that will excite the col-
legiate world. But we do wonder about the worth of-this effort to attract
good teachers and to construct new facilities if the cosmoplitan nature
of our studentbody is so clearly in jeopardy. It is the most crucial ques-
tion before the University community and one which the new adminis-
tration must face up to if there is to be any hope for Pitt.

Illlillillllllilllli

the serious student deciding
whether or how well his efforts
will be evaluated.

Professor Tobias writes, “If the
professor knows that a large per-
centage of his class does not need
‘evaluation, then he will notdo
it for any.” When then should
the student spend the extra time
and effort on an assignment if
it is not going to be scrutinized.
by‘ the trained professional peo-
ple whom he pays and whose
knowledge and skill he respects.
Rather it may be skimmed over
and graded by a well-intentioned
graduate student not much old-
er or more highly skilled than
himself, who- is pressured by his
own exams, papers and other
scholastic obligations.

In as_much as a professor can
evaluate precisely work which
will “disappear into a pass,” the
student can seriously devote him-
self to creative workwhich will
not be given “a rigorous and thor-
ough analysis” by his instructor.

Have we reached the point
when the faculty are too busy
with their publishing deadlines
and extra curricular obligations

to ‘attend to the business for _
‘which they are employed and to

which they have‘ pledged service?

Last year the bowling team ﬁnished ﬁfth in the na-
tion among colleges, and they may have a chance to repeat
or better that effort this season.

This Saturday the bowlers meet St. Vincent and Car-
negie Tech to decide the championship of the Western Pennsyl-
vania Division of the National Intercollegiate Bowling Association.
The winner is in line for a bid to the nationals.

The bowlers, Tartans and ‘Bearcats reached the roll-offs by
ﬁnishing as the top three teams in regular season play.

After getting away to a. 10-6
start, the bowling team ﬁnished
strong, winning 11 of "their last
12 games, to ﬁnish with a 27-7
regular season mark.

In addition they downed Ak-
ron in a non-league match, and:
won the Student Union Cham-
pionship Match at the University
of Maryland, downing Villanova
for the title. '

3 Wrestlers End Worst’ Year Ever;   

Future Bright With Nine Returning

The recently completed
wrestling season will long be
remembered in the Univer-

versity’s sports annals, not be-
cause it was outstanding but be-

_ cause it was the worse season

in history at a school which used
to have an outstanding wrest-
ling‘ reputation.

Brieﬂy, the matmen posted a
2-10 record in dual meets, de-

, feating only St. Francis, 24-8, and

Franklin and Marshall, 17-14. The
season ended on an equally dis-
mal note as the wrestlers ﬁnish-
ed 15th in the_ 16 team Eastern
championships.

Before the_season began, coach
Dave Johnson said he‘expected
to break even against the aver-

age teams. Losses to Cornell and;

Sryacuse dispelled even these
hopes.

Now the hope" for the wrestlers
is that nine of this year’s starters
return next season. Only Al
Traunsteiner, at 167 or 177, will
be missing and his loss will be
more than made up for by three
promising freshmen.

Greg Unangst won the fresh-
man Easterns title at 123 and:

Joe Kulm and Mark Stephenson
ﬁnished third in their weight
classes.

The’ leading returning letter-
men look to be Rich Shildt at 123,
Ron Schuchert at 137 and Terry
Hoover at 177 and 191.

Refounding—a climate in which

Business has no time for Dullsville   \

Dear Mr. Byman:

. A college senior at a recent Chicago-area vocational
_ seminar put into three words an attitude which.

each of you six students writing these open letters
with me alsohas expressed. _”Business,” he said,
”is Dullsville.” '

~l In one of your letters, you wrote that ”business

lacks g|amou_r.’.’ Mark Belnick of Cornell spoke of
business as ”the evaporator of creativity.” To

Ed Kokalas at Michigan State, business wants ”the
square peg for the square hole.”

Larry Warner at the University of Texas felt that
business looks ”boring” and ”unimaginative” to
students. Harvard's Jim Hill was concerned that,

in business,_”competence is clouded by acute
boredom/’. And, from the University of Southern
California, Tom Fehn wrote this about the
businessman: ”His distinguishing mark is sameness.”

There is no denying that dull executives and dull
companies do exist. This does not prove, however,
that business and businessmen are dull, any more ‘
than. the acorn which hit Chicken Little proved the
sky was falling.

In reality, no top-notch company today could
afford to waste time or people in Dullsville even
if it wanted to. ’

You can find the excitement and challenge of
business in countless examples. But in this letter I'd
like to go into some detail with all six of you
dialogists on the same one business situation which
mostclearly illustrates my point. I call/it refounding.
Refounding is a corporate process in which the
thrusts and challenges are forceful and far reaching.
You will find it in all kinds of alert American
companies today. There is no more personally
rewarding experience in business than taking

part in refounding.

Whatlis refounding? What is so remarkableland
exciting about it? Refounding essentially is the

‘ ‘- formingof a whole new business right inside a

corporation which already is established. It is
a more complex matter than ordinary growth; it

 

 

/

can demand more sophisticated effort than the

original founding.

You ”refound” when your company makes its first
entry into a market which is new to it (a lumber

‘company comes up witha facial tissue), or when

you develop a product or service which creates
its own new’ market (an industrialelectronics
company designs a computer for the home). You
refound, in short, when your company sets out

to fill a need which is distinctly different from the
one for which it was founded.

Youstart by selecting a group of your best men to

do the job. Doing the job calls for changes—changes,

in established research techniques, production
methods, financial policies, marketing procedures;

~ changes in business functions which may continue’

to serve your old business admirably, but just would
not stand the strains of the new fields, new
products, and new problems of refounding.

Refounding calls for that combination of
determination, skill, flair, and vision which has been
called ”the founder's touch.” It offers a founder's
sort of adventure. No books have been written to
guide you. No directives from topside are offered
for youlto lean on. You must feel and think your
way through the uncharted.

Incidentally, your efforts and objectives often affect

' the whole organization because, through all the

experiments, failures, false starts, sudden set-backs,
and snow-balling expenses, the regular business
must continue to thrive.

My own most direct knowledge of refounding

‘ naturally comes from Motorola. We were founded

in 1928. The company's development of the first
mass-produced car radio got us through the
depression—and led to our corporate name.

We still make radios and other consumer electronic
products. But we also make semiconductor
products, control systems, industrial and hospital
communications systems, automotive electronics
hardware, and aerospace equipment. These may
sound like brothers to a‘ radio, but they're more like
seventh cousins. To bring each new product group

 

 

on stream called for changes in the way we
thought and worked—from basic research right on
through to shipping. Whether it was our first police
communications system or-our first involvement

in semiconductors, it called for refounding.

Refounding in any company tests and retests the
professional capabilities and the spirit to succeed of
the men who are involved. There is no room for
gray—fIannel yes—men..Refounding calls for men who
can grow with the challenge—'the men who will
determine the future of that company.

The men of your own generation will accomplish
more refounding faster than any other generation.
This is because new technological discoveries and
new consumer needs are multiplying—and each one
of these can spark a refounding.

It is generally the younger men-the restlessxones,
the bright ones—-who set the pace in refounding, for
refounding calls for fresh thinking. For vision. For
creativity. Dull men or dull thinking will fail. If a.
business cannot afford to fail, it cannot afford

to be dull.

l

If you want this kind of excitement and challenge,
then, look for a company that is searching new
horizons. You will find companies like that in every
industry——and you will not find them dull. Both
men and companies flourish in the climate

of refounding.
