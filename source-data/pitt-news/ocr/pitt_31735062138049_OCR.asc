A change in the capacity of 1‘e._2‘iS-

midyear registration after Christmas
vacation will be discussed and proba-
blv be approved today by the mem-
bers of the University registration
committee at its meeting in the Fac-

According to John G, Quick, Univer-
sity registrar, the discussion will cen-
ter uround a new proceduietliat has
as its central idea, a change in the du-
ties of the faculty adviser_

If approved, the adviser in the fu-

provided and the students will be
kept advised of closed sections.

The beneﬁts to be derived from this
proposed plan are threefold: ﬁrst, that ;
the adviser will be given more tilne
to serve as an educational counselor
when he is freed from the clerical la-
bor involved in working out schedules.
Secondly, the student in constructing
his own schedule will naturally be
more careful to avoid coiiﬂicts.
Thirdly, it is expected that the time
required for future registrations will
be reduced because the usual delay
that occurs when a. 1'01-atively small
group of advisers are required to con-
struct the schedules of many students
will be eliminated if each Student
makes his own schedule.

Mi‘. Quick was doubtful if the new
plan, if adopted, will -be used for any
of the incoming freshmen during the
formal February registi'a.tioii.

Dramatic Trends

Mrs. Parry Cites British Talkie,
As Too Slow For Americans '

Mrs. Floreiice Fisher Parry, Pitts-
burgh Press columnist, summarized
the recent theater and movie move-
ments at the meeting of Inquiry forum
Wo'ln_esday. ,

l‘frs_ Parry c iscussed the uniﬁcation 
of the theater and the movies “The”
fact that motion picture stars are be-
ing used for dramatic productions,
and that the motion pictures are using
dramatic stars has resulted in the pro-
duction of ﬁne plays,” she said.

“'l‘he result of the talkies,” Mrs.
Parry said, “is tli-at pictures do not
have to cater in an acute way to the
mass taste, and so the ‘tlieater is get-
ting an adult, reﬁned, cultured and;
discriiiiiiiative audience. Caution
shoulrl be taken, however, that the
pictures do not become so distinctive
that they lose their touch for the
masses for whom they were created.”

In regard to the “Legion of decency"
whit-.11 was created within the Cath-
olic cliurcli, Mrs. Parry advocated that
it should be regarded more from a
religious viewpoint. She declared:
"While I do not agree that all of the
pictures which they place on their
condemned list are bad, if I were a
Roman Catholic I would realize the
justness of their list.”

Mrs. Parry, in comparing the British
ﬁlms with American said, “The Eng-
lish producers trust nothing to the
imagination of their audiences. VVe
quick thinking Americans, who are
usually a jump ahead of the actors,
ﬁnd the English pictures slow for this
reason.”

PublicArt Choice: .

Lacks Enduring
Touch-Hovey

 

“Art is always just a little ahead
of the public,” says Walter H, Hovey,
professor and acting head of the ﬁne
arts department, in commenting on
the choice of the popular prize at the
Carnegie International Art exl1ibition_

The popular winner was “Tropic
Seas” by Frederick J. Waugh.

“A depicting of actuality, an inter-
est in detail, and a perfect rendering
of texture———a.ll these are in ‘Tropic
Sea.s’,” said Mr. Hovey. “But still it
lacks the touch of enduring greatness,
An enthusiasm for creating an origi-
nal idea or thought and a complete
attainment of the step forward, it is
these rather that make a painting
great. While the public is learning to
understand and appreciate an artistic
standard, artists are always engaged
in forging trends on a higher level.
As a result the popular taste is never
an indication of the ‘best in art move-
ment, but rather an indication of the
general level of taste which, in itself,
inﬂuences the work of the artist.”

Mi‘. Hovey considered that the ﬁrst
prize winner was quite in keeping
with the public’s usual ﬁrst choice.
The public seemed to be captivated by
the realism of the green sea rolling in
savage breakers on a rocky coast. As
usual, the story element in the paint-
ing suggested something connected
with their own lives_

The fact that “Dinner for Tl1-resh-
ers" by Grant Wood received the third
largest number of votes was gratify-
ing. to Mr, Hovey. He stated, “The
public is inclined to think of art as
beautiful and idealistic. The plebeian
quality of the painting might have
obscured its merit.”

Carlson Invites
Students To Cage
Clinic Tomorrow

Duquesne, Carnegie Tech Teams
To Stage Demonstrations
For District Coaches

“An open invitation” is what Dr. H.
C. Carlson, head basketball coach, of-
fers to students tomorrow when vis-
itors from Pennsylvania and nearby
states come to the stadium for his
ﬁfth annual basketball clinic.

Students will be admitted to ses-
sions beginning at 9 o’clock, when
prominent ‘basketball men will dis-
cuss features of the contemporary
game, M. R, G-lover, commissioner of
United States basketball officials, is
listed to speak on “Changes in rules.”
Dr. George Kowallis, assistant basket-
ball coach at the University, will ex-
plain the “Correlation of physical edu-
cation and student health programs.”

The Carnegie Tech basketball squad,
in attendance with Coach Max Han-
num, and the Duquesne squad, with
Coach Chick Davies, will demonstrate
typical ba.sketba.ll formations during
an afternoon session, to illustrate Dr.
Carisoirs explanations of “An, offensive
system” and “Correct shooting.”

The practice of inviting teams from
other city schools to take part in the
demonstrations dates from the fall of
1930, when a Pitt basketball team
spent a hectic afternoon going through
formations for the enlightenment of
clinic visitors, only to lose that even-
ing to a physically fresh team from
VVeste-rn Reserve. Neither the Tar-
tans nor the Dukes have scheduled
games for tomorrow night, however,
and their coaches are willing to let
them frolic tomorrow afternoon.

A special edition of The Pitt News
will be distributed to visitors, and
dinner will follow at VVebster Hall.

As a climax to both clinic and din-
ner, the Panthers will meet the Buck-
iiell I-lisons in the first game. of the
season, in the stadium pavilion at 8
o’clock.

'Entry Of Women
Into University
Commemorated

 

Campus, Local Musical Talent
Participates In Program
Titled “Music In Life”

All University women iiuite today
at 12:30 o’clock in Memorial hall to
celebrate the annual VVomen’s Day,
commemorating the entry of women
into the University.

This year, the tenth in which Wo-
inen’s Day has been observed, marks
the 39th year since the admittance
of women into the University’s aca-
demic life.

’l‘he University ﬁrst became coedu-
cational in 1895 when VVilliam J. Hol-
land, then Chancellor, presented favor-
ably to the trustees the request of

the Misses Margaret Lydia Stein and
Stella Mathilda Stein for permission
to study in the College. These two
young women lvere admitted more
than 100 years after the founding of
the University.

“The finest way to express apprecia-
tion for these pioneer women is to
attend the VVonien’s Day progra.m to-
day,” says Miss Thyras 'W. Amos,
dean of women.

Anne June Elmer, C36, chairman of
the Traditions coininittee of VVSGA,
which has Planned the event, has an-
nounced the theme of this year’s pro-
gram “Music in life.” “Shakespeare
in ‘As you like it’ said that there were
seven ages in the cycle of life,” says
Miss Elmer. "and since music is man’s
only universal language, we have
chosen to give the interpretation of
life in a program of music.”

For babyliood, the ﬁrst stage of life,
Bernadine Kittell, C35, Louise
Loughner, C35, and Caroline ‘Hall,
Ed 36, will sing a trio number, Brains’
“Lullaby.”

Lucille Hamilton, C35, will sing a
grgupyof A, A, Miliiefs_,_poe_nis set to
music to represent childhood, the sec-
ond stage of life. _For young man-
hood, the Men’s C-lee club under the
direction of Dr, Walter H. Wright is
to sing “La Marseillaise,” and Baclrs
“Grant us to do with zeal."

Courtship, the fourth stage of life
will be presented in a solo “Rispetto"
composed by VVolf-Ferrari and sung
by one of Pittsburgh’s best known
singers, Helen Bell Rush.

The Woman’s choral directed by
Mrs, Robert Ayars sings the “Bridal
Chorus” from Lohengrin by VVagner
for “Ma.rria.ge,” life’s ﬁfth stage.
Handel’s “I know that my redeciner
liveth” is the song chosen for Miss
Rush’s solo for the next stage, ma-
turity.

The ﬁnal stage, contemplation of
death, will be Cliopin’s “Etude in
Csharp minor” played a.sapiano solo
by Mrs. J ames H. Greene, well known
in Pittsburgh musical circles. After
she has played for the last stage of
life, Mrs. Greene will begin Brahms’
“Lullaby” signifying the beginning of
life again and the end of the program,

This morning women are wearing
blue and gold tags saying “I’ll meet
_vou at Women's Day Friday at 12:30
o’clock’’ as a reminder of the occa-
sion.

Members of Mortar Board, senior
women's honorary activities frater-
nity, will usher.

Virginia Boyd, C37; Eleanor Fedi-
gaii, C37; Margaret Lewis, C36; Agnes
VVilson, Ed35; Martha Bedsworth,
C37; Janet Dague, C37; Margaret
Marcellus, C37; Ruth Tonkin, Ed36;
Harriet Dittmar, C35; Eleanor Mance,
C35; Betty Seamon. C37; and ‘Mary
Ann Grohol, C37, are the members
of the Traditions committee which
planned the program.

Students To Hear
Polar Explorer

Stefa-nsson To Speak On Trend Of
Civilization Northward

University students and members
of the faculty will re-discover the Far
North VVednesday morning at 10:30
o’clock along with Dr. Vilhjalmur
Stefansson. All third hour classes will
be omitted to provide time for the
lecture, which will take place during
the third hour in Memorial hall.

With Admiral Robert E. Peary,
Stefansson is recognized as one of the
two greatest of all polar explorers.
He has spent more winters above the
Arctic circle than any other Arctic
explorer, and during these winters
has explored and mapped out over
100,000 square miles of hitherto un-
known polar territory. Stefansson
says the “t‘rozen North” isn’t frozen,
and that present beliefs about it are
antiquated and not warranted by ac-
tual facts.

In his lecture “The northward
course of empire” Dr. Stefaiisson
plans to point out a new and habitable
North, tracing the uninterrupted
spread of civilization northward from
its cradle in the tropics, and showing
why that 'northward trend will not
stop untilthe Arctic is opened up and
I developed. He is credited with being

the first explorer to point out methods
§b_v which transpolar commerce is go-
;ing to mark a new era by uniting
‘temperate zones with the Arctic,

Academic Freedom

HAT HE SAW’ in “some sec-

tions” of the United States
prompts Dr. Carl 'Wittke to warn
the American Association of Uni-
versity Professors that academic
freedom is in danger.

The Ohio State professor, chair-
man of the association’s Commit-
tee o11 Academic Freedom, de-
clined to say what speciﬁcally in-
spired the prediction.

His report to the association
laments:

“The democratic way of life is
on the defensive everywhere, and
there are few countries in Europe
where it has not become unpa-
triotic to think. This depressing
picture of European conditions is
not without its counterpart today
in some sections of America.”

At the very time that Dr.
lVittke’s gloomy conclusions were
being distributed, the wire serv-
ices of the American press were
sending out conﬁrmations.

At Weimar, Germany:

Dr. Hans Leisegang, philoso-
pher of the University of Jena,
had just been convicted by a sum-
mary court and sentenced to six
months’ imprisonment for an af-
front to Reichsfuehrer Adolf
Hitler.

The Jena professor was charged
with having remarked, during
Hitler’s speech at the funeral of
Von Hindenburg, “Really, Hitler
ought to quit talking, for he can
only make election tirades.”

At Baton Rouge:

Students testiﬁed that Dean
James F. Broussard, acting presi-
dent of the University of Louis-
iana, told suspended members of
the student newspaper staff that
they would learn by the time they
had reached his age, that “prin-
ciples don ’t mean much.”

“The Reveille,” Louisiana stu-

dent weekly, was suppressed fol-

lowing the publication of a letter
criticizing Huey Long, dictator of
the surprising state of Louisiana.
‘  -'3\'< =li=

There is no peace of mind in
reflecting that ll-Teimar and Baton
Rouge are a good many miles

‘IV HlTl<1-FLAG-GED PEGS on the

Cathedral lawn last week marked
in outline the space that will be used
for the Stephen Collins Foster Me-
morial theater. Ground will be
broken during the month, it is expect-
ed, and the white-pegged outline was
for the purpose of deciding whether
the new structure shall be built with
its axis parallel or diagonal to the
base of the Cathedral.

Students will be interested in the
progress of the memorial, and whether
it is ultimately built facing Carnegie
library or facing Forbes ﬁeld, will be
a question for esthetic controversy
only.

A most encouraging thing is the re-
ﬂection that the planning group was
willing to consider an alternate sug-
gestion so shortly before construc-
tion. '”

Perhaps -the group will ﬁnd it not
too late a. day to reconsider its deci-
sion to deny space in the Cathedral
for a student eating place.

Inasmuch as the new (Faculty club
rooms will, provide such advantages
for faculty members,

And inasmuch as students are now
permitted half-hearted luncheon fa-
ci1ities—in the stands on the eighth
and tenth ﬂoors of the Cathedral—-
where students are nourishing them-
selves every day from a selection of
sandwiches and pie.

Dr. Daugherty To Study
Effects Of Steel Code

Dr. Carroll R. Daugherty, assistant
professor of economics, has been
given a leave of absence to study the
effects of the steel code on labor for
a special research project now under
way in the Bureau of Business Re-
search_

The Bureau is cooperating in this
project, with the Brookings institu-
tion, of Washington, D. C., which is
engaged in a general study of the
effects of NRA on the nation’s eco-
nomic structure, An intensive analy-
sis of the effects of the code for the
iron and steel industry will be made
by the Bureau.

By Raymond Pearlman 

N AN INCREASING number of magazines there have appeared:
articles about the rise of proletarian culture—-especially proleta- 3
ri-an literature——and also about the decay of capitalistic culture.
More and more we read of revolutionary poetry, of workers’ dra-
matic groups, of liberals going left, of intellectuals joining the ranks
of the Communists, and of entire apostasies of capitalistic writings.

Phases Of Proletarian Literature

espousing the cause of proletarian lit-9

erature. These articles, moreover,
bear headings such as, ‘“£Literature
Goes Left,” “Sinclair Lewis, The Last
of the Literary Liberals,” and recent-
ly in the “Nation” of November 28,

titled “The Last of the Liberals.”
And, today, contemporary writers
of forethought are grasping the mean-
ing and importance of this movement.
True, writers like H. L. Mencken 11&V€

no sympathy for such a movement...

VVhen he recently discussed the move-
ment of proletarian literature in “The
Saturday Review of Literature,” Mr.
Mencken mocked at it, and called it

‘the creation of inferior minds and a

result of prosaic imaginations. How-
ever, such men as Sherwood Ander-
son, Theodore Dreiser, and Albert
Halper have declared themselves en-
thusiastic about the movement. Rob-
ert Herrick writing recently in “The
New Republic,” said that the sudden
emergence of this new labor literature
is signiﬁcant and prophetic.
The New Proletarian Movement

But what is this new movement of
proletarian literature about? “Pro-
letarian literature,” says V. F. Calver-
ton, “is working class literature in-
spired by revolutionary purposes. It
is concerned with the working class
not as an object of sympathy or com-
miseration, but as the creative source
of» a new society.”

Its characters are not doctors,
lawyers, inerchants, and preachers,
but are miners, milkhands, and factory
workers. In its incipient stages, to-
day, revolutionary pcetry, drama, and
prose all revolve around one central
axis: the oppression of workers by
capitalists. The workers are all
heroes; the capitalists, all bad men
and villains. This movement has but
one fundamental objective——to teach
to all. and to the workers especially,
the historic destiny of the proletariat,
as a class which will ultimately ob-
tain the instruments for the means of
production,

Roots In Soviet Regime

It is diflicult to trace the origin and
growth of this movement because it
is so young. This, as any other move-
ment, did not suddenly make its ap-
pearance, and emerge in full bloom.
No doubt the impetus has come from
the Russian revolution of 1917 and
the emergence of the Soviet regime.
But the movement can be traced back
much further. Amable Tastu, the
nineteenth century poetess, asserted
during the political revolutions of her
day that “It is to the proletariat .
that now belongs the creative and
primary role of poetry.” George Sand,
inspired by the workers’ poetry of the
day, declared that “the elements of
the future ought to be a race. of pro-
letarians, wild, proud, and ready to
claim the rights of mankind by force.”

In England, perhaps the first ex-
pression of proletarian writing is that

Another Harvard Poll

Of the 800 questionnaires distributed
among the non-residents of Harvard
by the Brooks I~'iouse Investigation
committee, preliminary returns from
100 of them showed that 83 men

“Are you satisﬁed with the present
facilities at I-Iarvard for the men liv-

of D_ H_ Lawrence. This Nottingham-
shire miner was obsessed with class
relations. The same theme recurs
over and over again in his novels: A

worker is the hero.

The best expression of the prole-
tarian movement in America ﬁrst ap-
peared in 1906 with the publication of
Upton Sinclair’s “The Jungle,” giving
an horrible but true picture of labor
conditions in the Chicago stock yards.
This was followed by “The Goose-
step,” about conditions on American
education and the "G0slings,” on
American schools. Then came “King
Coal,” about the coal mining camps
of Colorado.

Cynics Change Attitude

The cynicism of the ’tw‘enties
stopped the progress of the proletarian
movement for a short time. It is in-
teresting to note the change in atti-
tude of the “debunkers” rampant in
the ’twenties, and to note where they
stand today on proletarian literature.
It is dead ‘because it had no purpose.
It was their personal criticisms for the
sake of sheer criticism. It had mere-
ly ridicule and mockery in mind, but
what it lacked was reform and con-
structive censure. It tore everything
apart, and offered nothing in its
place. True, that might have been
in keeping with the post-war psy-
chology_ But has not the outlook
changed? In other words, as V. F.
Calverton puts it: We are now see-
ing the individual in terms of society
instead of, as before, society, through
the individual.

Lewis Hails Labor Novel

Even Sinclair Lewis—and this
change of his has been most recent—-
has enthusiastically hailed the novels
of Albert Halper, one of the outstand-
ing proletarian novelists; and he ad-
dressed himself not long ago to the
task of writing a labor novel. Whethe1'
this attitude is due to insight -into the
above situation, or whether he has
been compelled to yield to this move-
ment because of pressure by his co-
intellectuals, is hard to say.

One can say with a good deal of
certainty that the stubborn and effete
Mr. Mencken will never be ranked
with the proletarian writers. This
fact certainly tests the sincerity of
his former harangues. We can now
see him in his true light. He reminds
the writer of many professors who
shout, and declaim, who wave their
arms madly, who become upset and
emotional about the injustice of pres-
ent conditions, yet who stop there,
and are afraid to do anything about
it. They are diagnosticians, but have
no prescriptions!

In closing it is of great iniportan-'.*.e
to point out that the present crop of
proletarian writers are not of the pro-
letarian ranks, but are recruited from

S e c o n d Presentation
Of “Fashion” Received

to ten cents per “cuss” word.

Vigorously

 

By Alan Lloyd

A week or so ago, I sat with Carl
Swartz in the balcony of the YM-
WHA auditorium and listened to the
second presentation of “Fashion.” 1
did more than listen; I practically put
on a show myself, just as the rest of
the audience did, Everyone, from a
student with his bag of vegetables
and pocketful of cigars to the Mc-
Keesport school boy with a bag of
iron washers, threw things on the
stage, material or verbal.

The players deserve special praise
for this second performance, for they
faced a. terriﬁcally disparaging audi-
ence.

Instead of entering with 1850 spirit
into the play, with a logic to remarks
and sympathy for players, this audi-
ence was there to ridicule the play
and merely to have 3.. good time.
I/Vitness to the fact is that many of
these had seen the ﬁrst presentation
and had returned to lead the barrage.

The remarks were funny, not humor-
ous; the boos and hisses were mis-
placed; the cheering lackadaisical;
the. aim of throwers appalling; and the
general attitude was of smartness, not
interest. Yet despite this, the play-
ers carried on. “When that onion
nearly smacked Inc,” Elbaum—the vil-
lain to you, and a darn good one———
began, “I didn’t know whether to
break my pose or not.”

“And I nearly lost my lines a dozen

times,” Kit Hall added, “And besides,
iron washers instead of pennies- tsk
tsk!” Nelson Mills, who had the diffi-
cult role of Papa Trueman, and who
had many long lectures to give in the
course of the play, admitted to me
that it was hard to carry on many of
the monologues before such competi-
tors as the audience offered.
- Our friend the cook, alias Count
Joliemaitre and Marquis Patterson,
told what a time he had had. In the
script, those who saw either presenta-
tion of “Fashion” will recall, the
Count admits his disguise, and tells
what wonderful dishes he could pre-
pare. Patterson rattled off a list that
sounded like a liquor menu, and when
he paused for breath someone far in
the rear chirped out, In other words,
‘I-Iash’.” The audience appreciated
the remark, while the dear count
“took it.” ‘‘It was all I could do not
to" laugh,” Patterson said, in the dress-
iug room, as he pulled off his French
beard, “And if I had . . . Boy!”

Yet that he did not laugh, that the
players all carried on is indicative of
the caliber of the group They did
well; the audience enjoyed itself; so
who could dare to say it was not a
success?

Carlson Quintet Begins Quest For Third Consecutivef
Title In Eastern Intercollegiate Conference

 

Rounding out Dr. H. C. Carlson ’s ﬁfth annual basketball clinic,
the Golden Panther varsity basketball team meets the Bucknell
Bison ﬁve in the season’s opening game on the stadium ﬂoor to-
morrow night. Wlith this game the Panthers will begin the quest
for their third consecutive championship in the Eastern Inter-

collegiate Conference.
o'clock.

VVhen the Panther varsity lines up?

for the game, only two men from last
season's ﬁrst team will be present,
Skippy Hughes and Claire Cribbs, co-
captains and forwards of this year’s
varsity. Hughes and Cribbs were the
leading scorers on the squad last
year, thus giving two sharpshooters
at the forward positions.

At the center post Pete Noon, un-
derstudy to Cribbs last year, will start
the game. Noon ﬁnished last season
by replacing Cribbs, who had been in-
jured, and as a result of his steady
play was given a starting position this
year. The move sent Cribbs up to
forward.

Teaming at the guard position will
be Ted Roderick, a substitute forward
last year. and Ross Emrick, a sopho-
more. Roderick, although used as a
forward replacement last year, earned
his starting berth because of his ﬁne
defensive work in the pre-season prac-
tices. Ross Emrick, the only sopho-
more on the ﬁrst team, starred on the
freshman team last year and looms as
a ﬁne prospect at the guard position.

Bucknell will send four sophomores
into its starting lineup, the only let-
terman on the team being Joe Rez-
nichak, captain and star guard on this
year’s Bison varsity, Besides star-
ring on the basketball team, Rezni-
chak also has been a standout perform-
er in both football and baseball, The
Bucknell varsity, as it lines up for the
starting tipoff. will have Kanengiser
and Fitzgerald at forwards, Monahan
at center, and Reznichak and Filer at
the guard positions.

As a feature of the initial g‘a.me,
both the Golden Panthers and the
Bisons will sport new uniforms. The
Panther suits are of a golden color,
with the letters and numerals in dark
blue. The sweat suits are also gold
with blue letters, and feature a new
design in the ma.keup of the suits.
The shirt is a. tuck—in zipper shirt,
the trousers being on the order of or-
dinary men’s trousers, including the
cuff at the bottom.

The game is scheduled to begin at 8:15

‘Boxers Prepare
For First Match

Boxing Fundamentals Stressed;
Issue Call For Candidates

 

There is a distinct smell of resin

and a sound of leather-clad ﬁsts
thumping on punching bags now that
the boxing candidates have set up
training headquarters in the stadium
; dressing room.
If The extra ﬂurry of ﬁsts is due to
fthe fact that Coach Schrick-er is put-
iting the boxers through the funda-
mentals at an exceptionally fast clip
owing to the fact that he has to as-
semble a ﬁrst—class squad for the
opening meet of the season on Janu-
ary 12 with Syracuse, at Syracuse,
New York.

Coach Schricker, with the Syracuse
match in mind, is making sure that
all candidates learn the boxing busi-
ness from the ground up. The ﬁrst
three nights of practice he stressed
proper stance, arm motion, and foot-
work. In order to round the candi-
dates into condition a deﬁnite train-
'ing schedule has been arranged. It
consists of shadow-boxing, road work,
bag-punching, ropeskipping, and three
rounds of sparring.

Any students who are interested in
trying out for the boxing squad are
requested to report to the stadium
dressing room any week day after 3
o’clock. Coach Schricker is especial-
ly anxious to have all freshman stu-
dents, whether they have had any
previous experience or not, report for
the workouts.
