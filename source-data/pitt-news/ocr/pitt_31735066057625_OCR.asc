Alcohol task force created to get ahead of problem

By John B. Moore

Asst. News Editor

Just a little over a week after the alco-
hol-related death of University of
Pittsburgh student Atif Bhatti, a task force
has been created to assess alcohol abuse
on campus.

According to Vice Chancellor for
Student and Public Affairs Leon Haley,
the task force was in its early stages the
first week of November when he asked
Dr. Bob Gallagher from the counseling
center to head the group.

Haley said a need for the task force,
which met yesterday for the first time,
was brought to his attention shortly after
he took his present job and saw the num-
ber of alcohol-related problems at Pitt.

“[A1cohol-related problems] became
apparent to me after meeting with my
senior staff, reading police reports and

- Resident Student Life reports,” Haley

said.

Gallagher pointed to a U.S. News and
World Report article that came out in
September reporting alcohol problems on
college campuses as another indicator for
the necessity of the task force.

“The article talked about problems on
campuses with alcohol and the linkage
between alcohol and sexual assault,”
Gallagher said. “Alcohol spills into a lot
of other problems  including sexual
assault and vandalism.”

Gallagher and Haley both agreed that
while alcohol ‘is becoming an increasing
concern on other campuses across the

country, Pitt should be above rather than
on par with other schools.

“This is a concern that hasn’t been
looked at for a while, and we shouldn’t
settle for the norm,” said Gallagher. “We
should do better.”

Haley said he wants the task force to if

find out what they can do to get ahead of
the problem.

“We want to see that we are doing all
that we can be doing and all that we
should be doing,” Haley said.

The 16-member board is made up of
faculty, staff and three students, represent-
ing the Student Government Board,
Resident Student Association and the
Interfratemity Council.

SGB President-elect Julie Crowell said

“When I saw the finished
product I thought ‘Wow, you
mean we did this? A bunch of
stupid college kids put together
something this good?”’ said
Chris Chirdon, a member of the
Thirst editorial staff.

' Chirdon said he had bought a

‘The mag is open to diverse

He said the real value lies in its
attention to events and stories
rather than issues, lessons and
political stances. Thirst is an
opportunity for undergraduates
to get some of their best stuff in

poem of a series of six dealing
with meditations of anger.

After seeing the ﬁnal product
in print, Chiusano said, “It’s a
great magazine. It fills a gap at

ary publication for an undergrad

There are so many students that

Miracle, dedication
pay off for director

By Stephanie Wright
Staff Writer

Everybody has a story, and
some stories have a happy
ending. For Anna Marie
Roman-Koller, a happy end-
ing includes a miracle baby,
a doctorate after 17 years of
night school and the honor of
receiving the “Outstanding
Woman of the Year Award
for the Spirit of the American
Woman.”

“I don’t think I did any-
thing special,” Roman-Koller
said.

Not so,
according to
three of her
former col-
leagues who
nominated
her for the
award. They
cited her
i n t e g ri t y ,
intelligence, courage, friend-
ship and determination.

Roman-Koller rose from a
secretarial position at Pitt to
administrative director in the
Department of Pathology at
the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center.

During that time, she
attended night school, taking
17 consecutive years to
obtain her Ph.D. Her daugh-

/

ter was only one year old -

when she received a notice
that her statute of limitations
for her doctorate was up.

“I had to petition [for extra
time], and they only gave me
a one-semester extension,”
she recalled. She finished her
dissertation between July and
November.

When asked about the
recognition she received as
Outstanding Woman of the
Year, she said, “I was really
embarrassed by [all the atten-
tion],” but also added that “I
was so moved.”

Roman-Koller was profiled
on WPXI—TV for her accom-
plishments.

She said winning the award
was a great opportunity to
publicly thank her parents.

As a parent herself,
Roman-Koller said her
lifestyle of working 55-60
hours a week, volunteering
and remaining active on sev-
eral committees is “mar-
velously healthy” for her
daughter.

She said that three-year-
old Alex is well adjusted.
She attributes part of this
adjustment to Pitt’s Child
Development Center where
Alex spends her day.

Roman-Koller said, “Every
working mother has mommy

guilt. It’s just a reality to
raising a child.”

Roman-Koller said she
calls Alex her Magee-
Women’s Hospital miracle
baby. After experiencing
three miscarriages and the
loss of a son who lived for
only 20 minutes, Roman-
Koller was hospitalized for
three and a half months of
her fifth pregnancy.

She transfered that experi-
ence into something positive.
Now she volunteers her time
at Magee-Women’s to coun-
sel women who have high-
risk pregnan-
cies and need
to be hospital-
ized.

During her
hospitalization,
she continued
to work on her
doctorate and
managed to
stay on top of her job with
the aid of the phone, fax and
lap-top computer.

Roman-Koller said her
husband Kevin has been very
supportive through every-
thing, and that Alex is her
biggest influence.

Roman-Koller said she
grew up with the inﬂuences
of June Cleaver. She said,
“We have to hope that our
daughters do not have that
stereotype.”

“I think it’s terrible that
there's a tension between
working mothers and those
who stay at home,” said
Roman-Koller. She added
that “there are wonderful
roles for both.” She said both
sides need to support one
another.

She said she remains posi-
tive that attitudes about the
gender issue will change, but
that “it will not be my gener-
ation.” She said, “I’m sur-
prised that people don’t get
over it.”

When asked if she is a
feminist, she quoted the
famous line: “If being a fem-
inist means I’m for equal
pay, for equal work and equal
recognition.”

She said she feels bad that
the word feminism inspires
such negativity in people.
“I’m disappointed that peo-
ple are afraid of that word.”

Roman-Koller chairs the
Provost’s Advisory
Committee on Woman’s
Academic Concerns, helps
with the fundraising efforts
of the Rainbow Kitchen in
Homestead and is treasurer
of the Parents Association at
Pitt’s Child Development
Center.

NAPLES, Italy — U.N.
Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali branded orga-

and urged govemments to join
forces to fight off the growing

Opening a three-day minis-

from the U.S. and 137 other
countries that the tentacles of
“crime multinationals” had
spread across the globe.

The conference takes place
at a time of mounting alarm at
the speed with which tradi-
tionally clannish organizations
such as the Hong Kong-based
Triads, Italy’s mafias, the
Japanese Yakuza and Russian
groups are beginning to make
deals with each other.

U.N. experts say internation-

which is more than the eco-

tries, and much of it “laun-

Students balance classes and jobs for extra mone

Part- time
jobs affect
stress, energy

By Kathleen Scanlon
Senior Staff Writer

As Gwen Young took apart
and cleaned the Roy Rogers
shake machine at closing time,
she could only think of the
chapter she had to read that
night for her history recitation.

She rushed home after work,
but fell asleep with her
Western Civilization textbook
open and a highlighter in her
hand.

“It seems like I’m kind of
smothered, like I don’t have
time to do anything,” she said.
“I don’t feel I accomplished

anything at the end of the

2020 EYECARE

"We’ve Changed Our Name"

 

 

 

day.”

Like many Pitt students,
Young must balance a part-
time job with full—time studies.
Some part-time jobs, like
Young’s, leave students worn
out and push them to race to
get schoolwork done. Other
jobs provide students with
study time or, at the least,
don’t sap a student’s mental or
physical energy.

Young said she feels tired
after a day of classes and
working, but she has learned
how to stick to a schedule by
holding a job. She works about
20 hours a week and takes 12
credits.

“Time is very valuable. I
know that,” she said.

Sometimes she relies on
Mountain Dew to maintain her
energy level, but even this
source of caffeine has its limi-
tations. “You’ve got that pep,

oun meezsr sus EVER!

but then it wears off,” she said.

Young does most of her
studying over the weekends,
which crowds out any kind of
a social life, she said.

During mid-term and finals
week, she uses her time wise-
ly, she said. She starts writing
papers long before they are
due and studies whenever she
has a free moment.

“I’m really proud of myself
—-— I haven’t failed any class-
es,” she said. “My grades seem
to stay up pretty well.”

Young said her job can even
be relaxing because she has
learned to stop thinking about
her studies in order to concen-
trate on waiting on customers.
She can’t think about how
much work has piled up in her
classes, because it may affect
how she treats the customers,
she said.

The Pitt News, Tuesday, November 22, 1994

     

Gwen Young works at Roy Rogers part time as well as being
a full-time student like many other students at Pitt.

her shift is usually the most
stressful part of the job, she
said.

“Coming into work is really
stressful because I think, ‘I
wish I didn’t have to work,
because I could be studying.’”

That thought doesn’t cross
sophomore Phil Rice’s mind
when he comes into work, he
said.“This is my study time,”
Rice said as he leaned back in
his chair behind a desk in the
Music Building.

Rice sits at this desk for 12
hours a week and hands out
keys to students who need to
use the practice rooms. Rice
also opens the building on
weekends.

The job gets boring when he
doesn’t have any studying to
do, but the time goes by quick-

ly when his friends come to
visit him, he said.

Rice said he has gotten to
know a lot of people who
work at the Music Building, as
well as students who frequent—
ly come to him for keys to
practice rooms.

Rice got the job through the
work—study program. The
money he makes goes for car
payments, which cost him
about $220 a month, he said.

Sophomore Kevin Myers
said he relies on his summer
savings to pay for living
expenses. He worked at
Cocalico Builders where he
served as a laborer, and saved
about $3,000, which he now
uses to pay for rent and food.

Now, Myers works in the

third ﬂoor stacks at Hillman
Library. He stacks books and
makes sure they are in order
on the shelves.

“Sometimes it gets boring 
because it’s repetitive. You
just do the same thing over
and over again,” he said.

But the job’s stress-free
qualities attracted him to
apply for the job. A friend of
his told him the job was easy.
Myers needed something to
do with his extra time and
needed some spending money.

“I needed the extra money
because it seems like I’m
always tapping [the] MAC
[machine],” he said.

As Myers stood on a ladder
and studied the call numbers
of each book on a shelf, he
said the job doesn't challenge
him.

“You just basically [have to]
know your alphabet,” he said.

But sometimes while shelv-
ing books, his mind dwells on
the things he has to get done

when he goes home, he said.

much I have to study tonight
because I have two exams
tomorrow — Physics and
Calc.”

Myers, an electrical engi-
neering major, works about 12
hours a week and has a 16-
credit load, but said he can
usually get all of his studying
done.

Sonia Ratnaparkhi, a junior
biology major, also said she
doesn’t have to struggle to
balance work and school.

“It’s not like I’m running
around or rushing to wor ,”
she said. “It’s balanced. I have
time to get ready to come to
work. I have time to do my
studying.”

Ratnaparkhi works at the
information desk in the
William Pitt Union 10 hours a
week and has 13 credits this
semester.

Robin Humphrey, a junior
nursing major, also has 13
credits this semester, but

yesterday's meeting focused
on organization and subcom-
mittees.

“People are under the
assumption that overnight
we’re going to make changes,”
Crowell said. “And we’re
not.”

Crowell said the task force
would meet at least two more
times before the end of the

term.

Realizing the university is
not an island but a part of the
community is one of the solu-

tions to the problem, Haley
said.

Therefore, a subcommittee
will branch off of the task
force to look at how Pitt can
collaborate with the communi-
ty.

Other subcommittees will:

0 Come up with a program
of intervention.

- Try to identify other
problems throughout the
country and learn from
them.

0 Seek input from students
and faculty.

works about 24-32 hours a
week.“It’s hard,” she said.
“It’s really tough  because
there’s not a lot of time at
work to do school work.”

Humphrey works as a nurs-
ing assistant in the schizo-
phrenic unit at Western
Psychiatric Hospital. She
observes patients and assesses
them by asking them ques-
tions such as “How has your
day been?” She also makes
rounds to make sure she
knows where all the patients
are.

Humphrey said her eight-
hour shifts drain her energy,
but she re-energizes by taking
a half hour nap after work,
and she makes sure she gets
enough sleep every night.
She usually goes to sleep at
9:30 p.m. and gets up at 5:45
a.m.

Meeting with friends and
comparing notes help her to
keep up in her schoolwork.
And the money she makes by
working helps to keep her in
school. Humphrey is responsi-
ble for her tuition and other
expenses, like rent and food.

Even though Humphrey has
no choice but to work in order
to pay the bills, and she would
like to raise her 2.2 QPA, she
said working has mostly bene-
ﬁtted her.

“When I don’t work, I feel I
have too much time on my
hands,” she said. “And I feel
that working at Western Psych
gives me a lot of experience
which, in nursing nowadays,
is something that you really
need and might even be more
important than a QPA,” she
said.“I’m hoping [that’s]
true.”

Thirst

°From page 1

Thirst aims to become a part of
the rich cultural life of Pittsburgh,
Coers said.

“Pitt has a vibrant culture,
whether realized or not, and there
is no reason not to get something
started that can build a reputation.
There are so many literary mags
out there, but no one seems to stay
around long,” said Coers.

Copies of the first issue are
being mailed to all English writing
and ﬁlm majors and can also be
found at local coffee houses,
including the Beehive. If you
haven’t got your hands on one, the
staff said it’s because their first pri-
ority was to basically “just get it
out there.” They are hoping that
the next issue’s distribution will be
broader.

Thirst is funded by SHAC, the
Student Honors Activities
Community.

Grant

°From page 1

Wipf is the first teacher to receive this honor at
Pitt as of yet. He said, however, that he feels “Pitt
has a tradition of excellence in synthetic chem-
istry,” and he is sure “others will get more of these
awards in the future.”

Vlfipf was bom in Zurich, Switzerland, where he
received his doctorate in chemistry from the
University of Zurich in 1987.

He said he feels it is very important to widen
one’s horizons and that the best way to do this is
to go abroad. This belief led him to the United
States to do research under Robert Ireland on syn-
thesizing F K-506 at the University of Virginia.

His original plan was to stay in the United
States for about a year, but he decided to stay on
once he received several job offers. Explaining
why he picked the University of Pittsburgh, he
said, “Pittsburgh is a great city to work in. I really
liked the chemistry department at Pitt. I felt it was
a very active and stimulating research environ-
ment”

With the fellow award, Wipf will be developing
new methods of synthesizing naturally occurring
molecules that have anti-viral and anti-tumor
compounds. One of the many outcomes from his
research is that his methods could be used in all
science ﬁelds and would enable a person to come
up with new reactions. This would enable one to
make new things more efficiently. something that
once took ten years to make could then be cut
down to two.

Early this year, Wipf received the Ruziczka
Prize from Switzerland, which recognizes pub-
lished works in chemistry.

In June, he received the American Cyanamid
Junior Faculty Award, which is an industrial
award given to those who have published research
which is viewed to be very important in that ﬁeld.

Other awards he has received include the A.P.
Sloan Fellowship, a very prestigious award, and
the 1993 Eli Lilly Frontier Award.

Assistant professor Peter Wipf is the first pro-
I fessor at Pitt to receive the $500,000 grant.

Wipf is currentlyteaching two classes this
semester at Pitt. He is teaching one undergraduate
and one graduate course.

Students find him very hard working, dedicated
and driven.

Graduate student April Cunnighan said, “[Wipf]
loves what he does, and you can tell. He loves his
research and the type of research he does. He

pushes us a lot, but no matter how many hours we

put into the lab, he is always their longer.”

There wiH be a ceremony given by the White
House in which Wipf will be receiving the
Presidential Faculty Award officially, although no
date has yet been set

Scholarship

°From page 1
English literature and phi-
losophy double major and
also works for Pitt part-
time in the educational
department, where he said
he has found a lot of sup-
port.

“My boss hired me
knowing full well that I
was HIV. They have been
really supportive,” said
Ricketts. .

Ricketts has known he is
HIV-positive since 1990
and said sometimes this
conflicts with his-school
priorities. ,

“I have to pay attention
to my personal life as well
as my academic life, and
sometimes staying up
all night and typing a
paper really isn’t all that
healthy for me,” said
Ricketts.

The scholarship he
received will help him to
stay concentrated on
school and put away some
of his worries about
money, according to
Ricketts.

“With this scholarship,
now I can really focus on
school. I’m not in it for
the piece of paper; I want
to enjoy every class I’m
in. It makes me sad to see
students who aren’t enjoy-

ing their education,” said
Ricketts.

Ricketts said he will
continue with his educa-
tion after graduating; he
plans to go to graduate
school for English, cultur-
al studies or dance.

Thirty-three-year-old
Ricketts is no stranger to
dance or writing. Before
attending Pitt, he danced
with the Pittsburgh Ballet
Theater for six years, and
he still does freelance
writing for In Pittsburgh
magazine.

All those experiences
helped him to get the
scholarship, but he said he
feels a lot of gratitude for
the faculty at Pitt, who
wrote letters to help him
win the scholarship.

“I received tremendous
support from faculty,
friends and the school.
The faculty were really
terrific in writing letters to
help me get the scholar-
ship,” said Ricketts.

But Ricketts, who said
he doesn’t easily give up,
is not planning to stop at
this scholarship.

Ricketts said, “I’m
going to try for many
more grants so that I can
attend graduate school
next year.”

Opinions

The Pitt News

Tuesday, November 22, 1994

Republican officials split

Another revolution? Lost in the shuffle of the huge
Republican gains in Congress has been the also huge
Republican gubernatorial gains, giving the party a majority of
governors and their largest number in 25 years. So this means
the Republicans can work together on the national and state
level to enact their agenda for the nation, right? Wrong!

At the annual conference of the Republican Governors
Association, the governors made sure to distance themselves
from their party members in Congress. They brushed aside two
centerpiece issues of soon-to-be Speaker of the House Newt
Gingrich’s agenda for change: his proposals to overhaul the
welfare system and a constitutional amendment allowing school
prayer. Gingrich was not directly attacked by any of the gover-
nors, and some embrace his call for a balanced budget amend-
ment — but only on the condition that the federal government
does not “pass the buck” to the states.

But the majority of the governors clearly asserted their inde-
pendence from Washington, even if that meant distancing them-
selves from the new Republican congressional leaders. “We’re
balancing budgets, we’re reforming welfare, we’re ﬁxing health
care, we’re dealing with crime,” said Gov. Mike Leavitt of
Utah, the new president of the Republican Governors
Association. He expanded by saying, “Our message will be to
congressional leaders, people of this country: ‘Give us the ball
and get out of the way. We can solve these problems.’”

Sounding like a southern governor of the ‘60s, California
Gov. Pete Wilson said, “We believe the states  are sovereign,
proud states of the United States. They are not colonies of the
federal government.” And Gov. John Engler of Michigan
received applause when he commented on the need to empha-
size economic stability rather than social issues: “If we don’t
deal with the economic issues, we’ll need more than prayer to
solve our problems."

So what does all this mean? First of all, it is another sign of
the splintering of the Republican party which The Pitt News
predicted would happen after the election results earlier this
month. But more than Republican splintering, it is a sign of
state and local dissatisfaction with the federal government, dis-
satisfaction so great that it is disrupting party lines when they
should be at their strongest. We predicted the Republicans
would splinter, but it is surprising that it is occurring this early,
before congressional sessions have started.

But it is not all doom and gloom. Several governors said they
would work with the congressional Republicans to try and take
this country forward. The writing is on the wall, though. People
are tired of the failure of the federal government, and state lead-
ers are ready to step in and take over. But like the American
people, the state governors want to have their cake and eat it
too. They tell the feds to get out of their way, but they also want
to keep all the money the federal government funnels to the

states .

Real cash beﬂer than all-purpose I. D.

( :onsider your I.D. card for
. a moment. It has your

picture, your name, your
social security number, a
Camegie-Warhol pass and a bar
code. The little red square on the
back is probably the most
important bit to most Pitt stu-
dents. That’s how you check out
books from the library and
where you keep your blocks or
choice dollars. There’s a lot of
money in that red square.

Let’s say the power of those
cards could be expanded. For
example, at the University of
Michigan you can swipe your
card into vending machines
instead of using real cash.
Choice dollar vending could be
the wave of the future at Pitt.

But wait, that’s not all. What if
we could register using the
cards? It would be the same as
using the library. Your card
would be read by a scarmer, and
all your vital statistics would
come up on the screen. Your
advisor could register you from
the terminal in his ofﬁce. He’d
punch in the course numbers,
and you’d be registered or know
immediately if the class was
closed. There would be no more
three—hour waits in Thackeray
Hall, straining to hear your name
called.

It all sounds rather spiffy,
doesn’t it? Now, imagine if you
could carry one of these cards
throughout the rest of your life.
Assuming that we all have to
graduate some time, we must
leave the ivory tower of the uni-
versity and begin fumbling with
the thousands of plastic strips
which will soon be our lives.
Keys, subway tokens, cash —
all are being converted over to
magnetic stripes.

Picture this, one card could be
a debit card, credit card, identiﬁ-
cation, a passport and a ﬁle for
your medical and financial
records. This is not some science
ﬁction dream, but rather a fast-
coming reality. AT&T advertises

that this will be possible through
them. Under the Clinton health
care plan, one of the ideas was
to provide an insurance card to
every American which would
not only act as an insurance
card, but also a receptacle for
medical records.

Along these lines, we could
soon have a cashless economy.
This would reduce crimes such
as muggings, which are mainly
quick grabs for cash.
Underground economies would
ﬁnd it difficult to function. Drug
dealing by credit or debit would
be hard to cover up, if the police
could access financial records.
You’d never have to worry
about having enough quarters
for the laundry. Finally, wallets
would be a lot thinner or obso-
lete, depending on the whims of
fashion. .

Experiments toward this end
are already under way. In the
August issue of Scientific
American, programs which
provide electronic welfare bene-
ﬁts are described. The current
presidential administration has
estimated that up to $112 million
in federal beneﬁts — everything
from welfare checks to veteran’s
beneﬁts —— could be distributed
electronically. In Maryland,
electronic distribution of welfare
benefits come through what are
called “Independence Cards.”

Now while all this may sound
rosy to the technocrats, civil lib-
ertarians are made slightly
uneasy by this prospect of
everything being on-line. The
idea that everything about you is
down-loaded for easy access
ought not make you sleep better
at night. VV1th this system, smart
thirteen-year-old computer
geeks can dig through your life.
And if political candidates and
figures think they have no priva-
cy now, wait until their lives are
at the mercy of a few key
strokes. Howard Stem’s run for
governor of New York ended
when he refused to give his

financial records over to the
election committee. If a comput-
erized economy were in place,
then chances are his financial
records would have been auto-
matically scrutinized by the gov-
ernment.

All of this is not as nearly far-
off as it seems. Currently, the
upper classes do things through
electronic transfers of frmds and
credit. The poor are being forced
to use the “Independence Cards”
mentioned above. Most folks in
the middle class have at least
one credit card. How hard would
it be to issue a few extra cards
and create a debit system? It
would be like trying to get
Oakland retailers to accept
choice dollars on a national
level. Only a few would sign on
at first, then gradually all would.

The other electronic devices,
cards with personal information
and the machines to read them,
will come along soon enough so
that everyone can be plugged
into the information super—high-
way. Yet, not everyone is
equipped to handle this sort of
thing. People not as aware of the
potential power of the informa-
tion superhighway will be at the
mercy of the hackers. While
there are people who are adept at
manipulating the system now, a
person can always take his cash
elsewhere. If you’re plugged
into and dependent on the
Department of Treasury's sys-
tem, then you’re at their mercy.
It will be a new kind of mug-

ging, but it will be a mugging all '

the same.

Instead of bar coding every-
one at birth, things are best left
as they are. It makes tipping eas-
ier, for one. Real cash is more
tangible. Despite the inconve-
nience involved, we ought to
keep it. '

Saliba glimmering
shade of green.

No, it’s not money (although it
will prove relevant), but that’s a
hell of a guess. It’s Irish green
—— Notre Dame that is.

The luck of the Irish has once
again proved to be exactly that.
With one game remaining this
Saturday at No. 17 Southern
Cal, the 6-4 Fighting Irish are
forecasted to appear in either
the Sugar Bowl or the Cotton
Bowl.

Is it really due to the luck of
the Irish? Not exactly.

Though that damned little
green leprechaun may have
sprinkled some magic over
South Bend, head coach Lou
Holtz and the Notre Dame
administration signed a contract
a few years back with NBC.
The end result is week-in week-
out coverage of the Irish.

It is true genius on the part of
Notre Dame. A perennial pow-
erhouse in past years, the
Fighting Irish have sunk to
mediocrity of late, but their
audience following has not.

By being nationally televised
on a regular basis, the revenue
and attention that Notre Dame
receives is second to none. For
Holtz it was, and is, his master
plan.

Picture it: before the days
when Notre Dame ran NBC
affiliation, the tiny man that
scarnpers up and down football
field sidelines knew that one
day his mighty Irish would be
no more. With feet a’blazing,
preparations for the future
churned smoke from his over-
sized ears.

Relying on tradition, which is
the foundation of this football
program, Holtz and Notre
Dame proceeded to allow NBC
to carry their games. With dollar
signs in the administrators’ eyes
and bowl hopes in coach Lou’s,
the Fighting Irish have made a
mockery of college football.

Understandably, revenue is a
key factor in the lives of these
programs, but to have your own
station is pushing the limits of
an amateur program.

What it has done for Holtz
and Notre Dame is unbeliev-
able. Because of the audience
they attract and the revenue they
can produce, two of the top
bowls are willing to invite them

Lady Panthers fall to Russian team, 3-61

By Michael Kovak
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s basket-
ball team opened its exhibi-
tion season on a down note,
losing to Rossianka
(Moscow) 63-61 Saturday
night at Fitzgerald Field
House.

Leading all scorers was
Anna Masalova of Rossianka,
as she fired in 25 points,
including five three-pointers.
Leading the scoring for the
Lady Panthers was senior co-
captain and leading returning
scorer Jenine Joyce and
freshman Latia Howard with
14 points a piece. ‘

Howard’s performance
pleased everyone around the
team, despite the loss.

Coach Kirk Bruce said,
“Latia is that good. It doesn’t
surprise me at all that she
came in and played as well as
she did.”

Howard also led the Lady
Panthers with seven
rebounds.

“I was pleased with my
performance,” Howard said.
“I didn’t expect to score that
much.”

The first 10 minutes of the
game was basically a see-saw
match with both teams trad-

ing buckets. However, a
three-pointer by Masalova
with 5:00 left in the first half
sparked a Rossianka run, and
the Russians led 27- 16.

Pitt rallied, sparked by
Howard and junior forward
Stephanie Petho, who fin-
ished the game with eight
points and five rebounds. The
13-5 Pitt run narrowed the
halftime margin to 32-29.

The Russian women came
out on fire to start the second
ha-lf, once again sparked by
the three-point shooting of
Masalova. Masalova hit a trio
of treys during the Rossianka
run to put them ahead 47-34,
five minutes into the second
half.

The Rossianka lead
remained in double figures
for the next 10 minutes until
the Panthers made their run.

Sophomore shooting guard
Erin Miller drained three
treys of her own, and a three-
point play by Howard
trimmed Rossianka’s lead to
63-60 with 1:01 remaining.

A foul was committed by
forward Larisa Jeldacheva,
who fouled out with 16
points, Rossianka’s second in
scoring.

Defeat bitter
for Rut ers,
bright or Pitt

By Brett Fondrk
Staﬂ‘ Writer

Ask Rutgers head coach Doug
Graber about Saturday’s loss to
Pitt and you won’t get much.

“It was a bitter defeat for us,”
he said as he stormed oﬂ°. “They
have a team that is certainly bet-
ter than 3-8.”

Not many people would beg
to differ with Graber as Pitt’s
1994 season came to a close.

Few teams in the Big East
conference possess the offensive
weapons that Pitt has.

On paper, the Panthers look
much better than 3-8.

They will end the season with
the top offensive lineman, top-
rated quarterback, leading rusher
and touchdown reception leader.

I And unfortunately for Graber,
Pitt’s offense showcased its arse-
nal of talent in Saturday’s 35-21
win over the Scarlet Knights.

Reuben Brown, who was
named to the 1994 coaches’ All-
America team before the game,
led the way with the kind of per-
formance that got him the honor.

Despite being hampered by a
cumbersome cast, Brown threw
his usual assortment of crushing
blocks as the Pitt line allowed
running back Billy West to rush
for 188 yards.

Brown, a senior, will surely be

John Ryan connected with Billy Davis for four touchdowns.

a first-round NFL pick. VVrth the
way that the offense has been
playing, he may not want to
leave.

“You could tell at the end of
the season that we were coming
together as a whole offensive
unit,” he said. “We wanted some
respectability, and I think that
we got it.”

Brown’s play led to another
big performance by West. West,
who finished the season with
over 1,300 yards, captured the
Big East conference rushing
title. From back-up to starter,
West ﬁnished a stellar season as
one of the top backs in the
nation.

Men's,
women's
swimming
sink at
Princeton

By Ed Ziegenfuss
Staff Writer

After having to
endure a grueling
seven-hour ride, the
men’s and women’s
swimming and diving
teams stepped off the

_ bus in Princeton, N.J.,
and were defeated in
Saturday’s meet by the
host Tigers.

The men lost 170-
131, and the women
were beaten 180-124.

“We weren’t quite as
good as we were the
week before,” men’s
head coach Chuck
Knoles said. “I think it
was because we had to
travel.”

“I was real pleased
with how we swam,”
women’s coach Marian
Cassidy Keen said.
“Sometimes it is diffi-
cult to get up and swim
when you’ve sat on a
bus for seven hours.”

On the men’s side,

°From page 8

“Billy West is Billy West,”
coach John Majors said. “He’s
become a whale of a football
player.”

Another big success story was
the play of junior quarterback
John Ryan. After losing his job
in the preseason, Ryan won his
job back against West Virginia
and never looked back. He led
the Big East in passing efficien-
cy coming into the Rutgers
game and certainly didn’t hurt
himself with Saturday’s perfor-
mance. On the day, he complet-
ed 20 of 31 passes for 255 yards,
including four touchdowns. 8

‘‘He’s smart, he makes the
right calls and after last year, I
know he can take a hit,” Majors
said. “He is a winning quarter-
bac .”

“I don’t think that it’s all me,”
Ryan said. “The whole offense
has just come together.”

“Everyone will be real excited
in the off-season, because we all
know what we can do.”

One of the leaders who won’t
be back next year is wide receiv-

er Billy Davis. Davis, who has 8

always been a reliable posses-
sion receiver, had a career day in
his last game in a Pitt unifonn.
Davis hauled in 10 passes for
135 yards and four touchdowns.
His nine touchdown receptions
on the season leads the confer-

ence. He also led Pitt as he ﬁn-
ished the year with 50 catches.

“The day I had, there’s not
much you can say,” he said. “We
felt really good going into the
game with our passing attack.
We have the league’s leading
rusher. That just makes it that
much easier to exploit them
through the air.”

And during the last parts of
the season, the Panthers had
been exploiting a lot of teams.
Pitt ﬁnished the season winning
two out of three and was only 38
yards away from beating Miami.

With West and Ryan retum-
ing, there is optimism that the

program is not far from tuming L

the comer.

“When building a program,
you have a lot of peaks and val-
leys,” Majors said. “We’ve cer-
tainly had more valleys than
peaks. Our record speaks for
itself.

“But I really believe that this L

football team, in the last one
third of the season, has
improved as much as any that I
have been involved with.”

But unfortunately for Pitt, the
season has ended. On the heels
of the late—season performances,
optimism is the key word.

“This program is turning
around,” Brown said. “It’s not
going to be ,a quick ﬁx, but you
can see it happening.”

in January even if they lose
Saturday and ﬁnish the regular
season at 6-5.

It is not NBC’s fault. They
know that much like the British
Empire of years past, the sun
does not set on Notre Dame
football. NBC is in a business to
produce and succeed, and on
Saturday afternoons in the fall it
has ﬁlled the slot.

Don’t blame Notre Dame

either. Rich in tradition and mar-
keted as America’s college
team, they have taken advantage
of a business opportunity, and
obviously it has proven quite
successful.

There is no other program
anywhere else that can get away
with what the Irish do. Fair or
not, they look on in another
shade of green —— envy.

with 36 seconds remaining
put Joyce on the line. After
draining the first foul shot,
Joyce missed the second one,
and Pitt trailed by two, 63-
61.

A steal by Joyce with 20
seconds left gave Pitt the
chance to win or tie. A costly
throw—away by senior point-
guard Carol Morton gave the
ball back to the Russians.

Pitt still had one more
chance when Tatiana
Astalieva missed a foul shot
and Morton grabbed the
rebound and dribbled the
length of the court before
getting called for travelling.

“The Russians kept driving
to the basket,” Howard said.
“We kept fouling them
instead of taking charges.”

Coach Bruce did not seem

as concerned about the
defense.

“When you only give up 63
points, you should be able to
win. It was not a bad defen-
sive effort,” Bruce said. “Our
offense needs the work.”

The offensive work will
come this week in practice as
Pitt gears up for the 7Up—
Desert Classic over
Thanksgiving weekend.

Pitt will face Arkansas in
the first round and will face
either UNLV or Texas-
Arlington in the final or con-
solation match.

Bruce said, “We have a
pretty good chance against
Arkansas. They play a tough
schedule and will be a good
test for us.”

Before the contest, the two
teams exchanged gifts of
goodwill. Pitt gave the

Russians T—shirts, while the
Russians gave the Lady
Panthers food items.

The Rossianka team,
which has already played
seven games against Big
East teams, has an average
age of 24. Masalova, the
oldest player on the floor, is
30.

Pitt is coming off of its
best season in 13 years. Last
year the Lady Panthers went
21-l0. Nine letter—winners,
including two starters, are
returning from last season’s
team. Two redshirts, fresh-
man JoJo Guzman and Julie
Fornadel, also return.

“We should have a good
season,” Howard said. “We
were all really nervous
before this game. We should
play well the rest of the
way.”

senior Matt Brady led the way
by winning three individual
events and one relay. Brady
won the 1,000-meter freestyle
with a time of 9:31.37, and
placing third in this event for
the Panthers was senior Gary
Mule.

Brady also won the 200-
meter butterfly in 1:52.61.
Senior Jeff Novotny finished
fifth in the event, six seconds
behind his Pitt teammate.

The third event that Brady
won was the 200—meter back-
stroke. He completed the dis-
tance in 1:49.38. Freshman
Pete Hezky finished the race
in third position with a time of
1:53.69.”

“I was content with how I
swam,” Brady said. “I am
swimming fast, and I am
happy with that.”

In his last swim of the day
Brady led the 800—meter
freestyle relay team to victory.
Joining him on that relay were
Mule, Jonti Bacharach and
Sami Vartiainen.

“Princeton was better than
we were and at that meet they
deserved to win,” Knoles said.

Other winners for Pitt were
freshman Steve Lewter, who
by winning the 100.ﬂy'won
his first event as a collegiate
swimmer. John Soulakis won
both the one-meter and three-
meter diving events for the
Panthers.

“I was pleased with the way

«we stood up and raced,”

Knoles said. “We didn’t have
anybody who didn’t try. The
guys really did the best job
that they could at this point in
the season.”

Other noteworthy perfor-
mances by the Panthers swim-
mers were junior Chris Balke
who finished second in the
100 backstroke. Junior Chris

Perry finished third in both
the 100 and 200 breaststroke
and junior Tony Sunseri fol-
lowed Perry by finishing
fourth in both events.

Bacharach and senior David 1

Williams finished two and
three in the 200 free trailing
Brady by only a second each.
Junior Jeremy McClean fin-
ished second in the one-meter
and third in the three-meter
diving events.

“We are going where we
want to go,” senior Keith
Bodnar said.

“I think that we are swim-
ming faster than anyone has in
Pitt swimming history,” Brady
said.

“These guys have done
everything that I’ve asked of
them,” Knoles said. “The only
thing that we are short on now
is experience. We are going to
keep our noses to the grind-
stone and work right on
through to the Big East
Championships and see how
many guys we can get to
nationals.”

On the women’s side, sever-
al swimmers had good days.

“We had many season—best
times all the way across the
board,” Cassidy Keen said.

In the 200 fly, junior Jenny
Doran won the event with a
time of 2:09.07 and senior
Christy Knobloch finished
second.

Senior Vicki Geubtner won
the 50 free in .24.6. Finishing
third, fourth and fifth were
Isabel Dejo, Chrissy
and Alicia
Tymes, respectively.

The 400 freestyle relay team
swam what Cassidy Keen said
was, “a really nice swim.”
Freshman Dejo led off and
was followed by fellow fresh-
man Kim Billen. Tymes and
Geubtner brought home the
victory for Pitt.

“I was happy with my per-
formance,” Knobloch said.
“Everyone on the team is
where they need to be for the
Buffalo meet which is coming
up in a week and a half.”

“It was a good experience
for us,” Cassidy Keen said.
“We were in the meet. The
girls never lost their incentive
to step up and race, which
shows a lot of maturity in this
team. It was easy for them to
get intimidated by Princeton
but they didn’t.

“I am pleased with where
we stand going into our
Buffalo Invitational.”
