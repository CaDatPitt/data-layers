160,000,000 years distant relatives
living on the stars ma «attempt to
collect -ﬁre insurance‘ or the com-
plete. destruction of ’ both life and
property of the earth. In discussing

possibilit of “the world coming’

to an-end,” . Heber D. Curtis, di-
rector of Allegheny Observatory,
points out that the astronomer, who
mustbe unorthodox for the consid-
eration of this question, is able to

. ﬁnd.reason.for both those who speak

negatively or affirmatively of this
plienomenon. A
Science has studied the apparent

' continuity of our universe in a num-

ber of aspects, ﬁnding that although

‘the continuity of the basal material

is; alnolutcythere is a gap between
the-mere structure and motion. A
pgonally,” admitted Dr. Curtis,

A‘ A y thatthere. is another gap which
orthodox scientists are prone to dis-
miss as insoluble. That is, the
simple chemical -action-the ﬂame,

own’ ’ﬂaming'.’I’ I

" “With space, energy, matter and

doubtless time apparently continu-
ing, with no atom lost, are we our-
seves the only manifestations that

astronomer. “I take a tablet of as-

Dr. Curtis compares the possi-
bility of the earth's destruction with
that of some stars which have al-
r_eady"been visited by the “ﬂaine.”~
These‘. ‘outbursts come suddenly and
without warning, and _a distant sun
goes’ through an experience‘ which
can only "* 2 described as tremendous.
No theo of these sudden outbursts
is entire y satisfactory, Dr. Curtis
explained. Neither do we know just
the-characterand the age ofthe
stars -to which the catastrophe has
happened. “But it is evident that
should such an accident happen to
our sun, so that it would send out
ten thousand times its present light
and heat for a few months, simply
nothing would be left of us on this
earth,” Dr. Curtis believes.

That the interesting aspect of this
astronomical irregularity is this,
the scientist showed-——it has been
estimated that at least six such cat-
aclysms happen per year among the
stars of the Milky Way. Assume
that there are a billion suns in the
Milky Way, also, assume that this
sort of explosive outburst could hap-
pen to any star. Then the simple
division of one billion by six indi-
cated that this‘ disaster might hap-
pen to any star once in about 166,-
000,000 years, which is relatively
short in the life of a star, calculated
the observer. '

Again it is necessary to assume
that it might or might not have hap-
pened to our sun; then the assump-
tion of our entire continuity is not
an absolute one. “With this very

LEACOCK’S ADDRESS

SET FORNEXT WEEK A

“F renzied Fiction” ls Subject
Of Canadian Humorist’s
Student Speech ‘

Dr. Stephen Leacock, known as
the “Canadian Mark Twain,” will be
the speaker at the generalassembly
next Wednesday. He will speak on
“Frenzied Friction." '

Dr. Leacock has attained interna-
tional recognition as a leading hu-
morist of the day. His knack of
story telling and his gift of carica-

ture have won for him favorable D9

criticisms from the various maga-.A
zines and newspapers. He talks just
as he writes, with a humor‘that is‘-
at the same time innocent, delicate
and yet full of satire. According to
the Detroit Saturday Night, Dr.
Leacock “makes you laugh without
being ashamed of it.” . I
Dr. Leacock’ was born in Englan

but in 1876 he came with his parents
to ‘Canada. He received his doctor of
philosophy degree in 1903 and since
that time has been connected with
McGill University where he is at
present head of the department of
political science. ’

Graduation Requirement Will
Be Discontinued At End
Of This Semester

‘A thesis will no lon r be a pre-
requisite for graduation from the
school of business administration,
Dr. Louis K: Manley, dean‘of.the
school‘ of business. administration,
has. announced. 9

After a ﬁve-year trial during
which submission of a thesis was a
requisite for $r‘dliation,. the prac-
tice will be discontinuedbeginnin
with the .-ﬁrst semester in the schoo
year of 1928-29. Students who
take a special interest in the work
may: substitute work on a thesis for
class work, Dean Manley states.

Concerning the ‘ change, Dean
Manley states, “It is the general
opinion that students of the school
of business administration will get
more from the systematic work in
the classroom‘ than from required
research work on a thesis. It must
be noted, however, that those stu-
dents who are specially interested
or adapted for the writing of a the-
sis may write a thesis and thereby
receive special assistance and in-
struction from the instructors.”

STANDARDIZED KEY

Adoption Of Lone
Pitt Pendant

Ca.mpusA- opinion does not favor the

proposed plan of a standardized ac-
tivities key if comments of heads of
the various TPitt activities mean any-
thing, it is revealed.
. .The adoption of the lan will mean
the abandonment of t e practice of
awarding individual keys for service
in campusi organizations by the
awarding of a standard key to each
student‘ engaged in activities. The
standard key would have engraved
on ‘its back the name of the activity

ticipated, according to plans. already
presented. '

R. Johnston, graduate manager of

DREAMER, IDEA LIZING CA THEDRAL,   
THINKS OF RISING STRUCTURE;

dows ~ at students laden with’ brief
cases, climbing the hill. but he W011”
call _by name the ten thousand who
hunt bacteria under the mics in the
Biology and Dental Buildings, who
come evenings to_ study ethics and
accounting and higher mathematics.
And he has the trees and the shin-
ing asphalt and the lamp-lit ways
of Schenley Park. On these paths
he wanders, thinking of the moon-
light on Iowa cornﬁelds and of
white grain elevators that stand
like ghosts in the night. A

He has his dreams of stone that
are mounting above the clay of
Frick Acres; he has his dreams of
quiet ' libraries and of music-ﬁlled
halls. But he does not always live
in The World That Was or in the
world which he is creating. _He
walks across the mud of Frick
Acresand watches the _boys who_ sail
boats on the pond behind the piles;
he discusses plans and ﬁnances with
Mr. Weber; and over his desk he
talks of poetry to the students who
wander into his ofﬁce.

He spends his hours at the many
duties that are those of a leader of
a large university. Since he recog-
nizes the diversity of the interests
of the students, through the facul-
ty and administrators of various
schools, be coordinates the. prob-.
lems of the ‘university. He has vi-
sion that .sees beyond careers and
huigppiness and money-making, that

tee .tlie ideals of the doctor, the
man, and theteacher.

from his spring vacation, bought a case of
‘ - “Canada Dry” and to his friends said, f‘Coino .
around to my rooms, this evening. . .” ‘

‘There was a sound of revelry by night,” as 3
Lord-Byron put it. And if you don't believe me,
look it up in some canto or other of Childe

This is not a story of ﬂaming youth. Or any-.

But just this: “Canada Dry” is the ‘smooth-
best, mellojwest, most-palatable ginger ale you’ve
ever tasted. It queiichesyour thirst. _ It has a

erages. It contains no capsicum (red pepper).

I once Hunters At It Again

 

 AMPUS‘ politics‘ are beginning slowly to take on 
’ an air of importance‘. and} studentpollticians are
preparing maneuvers for the elections coming.

the week of Me! 7. ,
Scrambles for the much-coveted oﬁcce of Student
Council, school association and class governing bodies
will be the order‘ of the day. And, unless the unex-
, pected(h_eppens,- e week after." elections _cs.mpus wise-
crackcrs. including" .defested- and successful candidates’,
f.-will be complaining-..eboutu  leek of.-llnterest shown
by the student body in school elections.
When student olllcers realise that their cities: are

as important as they themselves are able to make‘

them, only then will they be able to call‘ themselves
"interested" oﬂlcislemintcrcsted in the student groups
they represent, not in what they can garner as proﬁts
or glories of their impoverished holdings. And if these
to _be elected are interested only in being elected, stu-
dent voters need show no interest in voting-and they
will show no interest. Why westevtimel casting ballots
when it makes no, apparent difference‘ in election
results. ‘
-Throughout the campus, emcee will bejsought after
ffot as many .1-casons as there‘ will be candidates. Out-
standing gin-1. the 'eomingQelectione will be the Student
; Council balloting.
For‘ twoyears the calnpus  enjoyed itself over
;-a more -or  iunuslng spectacle. _,fAnnually a body of
 sixteen juniors and seniors, Student Councillors act-
fingss the governing body—-with executive, administra-
fcive, judicial-and legislative powers-—-represent six un-
Tdergraduate schools on. the Oakland campus, including
dentistry, education, business administration, engineer-
ing, mines and the college. Apparently, with such
vest powers, Student Council shculd- hold a position of
importance on the. campus. C
But if members of that body run for oﬂice simply
because they are dental students, and the school of
dentistry feels highly elated for some "mysterious rea-
ison in showing the rest of the Pitt world that it holds
half of the oﬂlces in the highest student governing
body on the campus; if members run because a fra-
ternity wishes to send to its national office the glori-
ous. news that its standards are of the highest calibre
‘since it numbers some of its frsters among the big

man on the campus; if candidates’ petitions are passed ‘

around by charitable friends or fraternal brothers, and
the candidate does not realize he is running for omca

until he sees his name in the list printed in The ‘Weekly.

or on the ballot; if students. want to be members of
Student Council for the social beneﬁts derived from
leeml-monthly dinner meetings-—if Student Council
candidates will persist in running for office merely be-
cause it means another oﬁlce and it is the thing to do,
then Student Council‘ will continue to‘ be the laughing-
stock of the campus, of no more importance than as
.3 group of detail assistants to the dean of men's and
dean of women’s oﬂices, working. out social calendars
and squabbling about petty details that committees
-could decide upon and with which I governing body
need not as a "body worry itself. ‘

Responsibilities cannot. be shunned by the council-
lors; they cannot merely sit around and acquiesce with
their administrative advisers, because -they do not care
to think through their own problems. The courage
expressed by a student. body's governing group will of
necessity be taken as representative of the student
group. What the group of councillors shows itself
capable of doing is what will be taken as its ability-—
Ind nothing more. '

Student Council rests under the somewhat peculiar
notion that student-administration and faculty relations
are limited to social eevnts; they never think of the
peculiar aspects of Pitt's complex life with the prob-
lem: of student interests, of curriculums, of courses
of study that might be desirable, of student scholarship,
and the many affairs pertaining to the purpose of the
university: training of a student body for future so-
tivlty.

The main reason for Student Counci1’s weak posi-
tion is undoubtedly the fact that the councillors them-
selves are not interested in work before them, have
no desire to think but only to assent to anything
brought up, and most important, of all, have no pre-
Vlous knowledge of the possibilities of s. Council or
ef its duties or of its problems.

Student Councillors themselves must know wlw
they wish to be members of the Council; must know
what they may do once they are chosen members;
must realize that the strength of the body depends
upon the joint strength and courage of individual
members.

The Weekly throws its columns wide open to the
ofIce—seekers, to bring before the voting students their
thoughts on student affairs at Pitt, what they know of
Ihdﬂlt tovernment and its problems, and why they
are desirous of holding omce,

Man's quest for his vanished youth,
I have endeavored income fashion
to recapture the glamour and the
confusion of the history I read,
chieﬂy in romantic works of fiction,
in my grandfather’s library,"

In 1843, Francois Villon, before
he died, told Cristofero Colombo of
an island of enchantmont, Bimini,
where ﬂowed a fountain of perpetual
youth. Columbus failed to and it;
Ponce de Leon failed; but one of de
Leon's lieutenants, guided by a map
stolen from Villon’s corpse, filled a
vial with the magic ﬂuid. Because
he loved the King’: Wife, he fell
victim to the Inquisition. The vial
became the property of a priest who
later gave it to Rabelais. From
this point on appear Don Quixote
d’ Artagnan, Cyrano dc Bergerac,
A1exander'Popo, John Silver, Major
Andre, and Edgar Allan Poe, all in
relation to the little vial.

Seaports in the Moon belongs on

perhaps The Haunted Bookshop.

. PROGRAMS

A month or so ago this column
had some remarks on programs-—
and here. are a few more.

HE season is practically over,

and in reviewing the programs

I ﬁnd things that are seriously
objectionable. Although there are
many ﬁne compositions, either new
or little heard, that just shout to
be played, the visiting artists give us
things that are played until their
titles are anathema. Practically
every violinist has pleyed Lalo’s
Symphony Espagnole and every
pianist the Moonlight Sonata. Three
orchestras played the ﬁnale and pre-
lude from Tristan and Isolde. I
don’t say s. thing against the indi-

lng them thrown at my ears at every
concert. . Every violinist, further-
more, has his pet group of arrange-
ments of popular novelties-—s.n’d I
think they're terrible.

OW THAT Spring has sprung, it seems inevi-
table that Greater Oakland should be peopled
with feverish llocts eager to set their tortured
yéamings into words. Unless we invoke Commander-
ln-Chlef Walsh, 11 . can be done to prevent the
ink-rash epidemic, but it is a natural right of man
to exude some spleen at such crises.

Down in West Virginia, a constant reader, men-
tioning the vernal script-urge, stated ' in the
Athaeneum that students had no more rlght to print
their naked verses than they had to bathe in public.
While we have always staunchly defended the right of
any man to bathe in public, we, too, are forced to
draw the. line . at promlscuou verse-emeerlng. Some
students inscribe facts that would shock a women Inex-
ried ﬁve years, and call it poetry. What is more, they
are proud of the stud’, and if you bell them it is "lousy,

Philip stood at his window, smiling half-sardonlcally, 'half-wist-
fully. The Timml. across the street, were shouting goodbyes to an
automobile which had Just disappeared "from Philip's sight. The
youngest Timms girl had been married and the guests were seeing
the bride and groom off.

lie had been standing at the window some ten minutes, watch-
ing the fun. The bride, all in white, and the groom, uncomfortable in
a teilcoat. had come running out, followed by a crowd of friends
throwing rice and goodluck shoes, and had tumbled into a taxi. Every-
body was shouting and laughing, happy beyond momentary worry.
Philip felt both amused and a little saddened by it; everybody seemed

so young and carefree and he felt scold and worried. Yet he wasn't. .

old--thirty-ﬁve isn't really so old. _

As he watched the last of the guests go back into the house
and hang the door, the rain began to slap the window in front of
him. His eyes shifted to the pane and he watched the course of the
drops running down the glass. He rather welcomed the rain; the
resulting dreariness fitted in better with his mood. He turned away
from the window and went back to his table where a green-shaded
lamp shone on a pile of papers. _

“Second ﬂoors (his room was a‘ second ﬂoor one) and window
panes," he thought as he ﬁlled his pipe, “they seem to be _mY Jinx-”
Yes. . . . .all his life ﬁgurative second ﬂoors and spiritual win-
dow panes had nteddled with his destiny. And it had all begun with
a real second ﬂoor and a real window Pane-

Whcn he was a boy of seven or eight his family had a second
ﬂoor ﬂat In an apartment house. He had always been partially crip-
pled, and that winter a dose of measles followed by pneumonia had
left him entirely helpless. When spring came he was able to be out

’ of bed, but he couldn't walk. I

In the corner of the kitchen, between the wall and the cupboard
and by a large window, was a space to be used as a breadboard. It
was big enough for a boy of seven to curl up in, and he had sat
there many a day through, eatlnﬁ his lunch from a tray. It kept him
out of his mother's road, and it was pleasant enough in the sunny

,0 ‘

d.” During the mornings when all the neighbor children were at
school Philip sat and read or drew pictures on paper his father
brought home from the bank. Often when he had ﬁnished a book
or had’ used all his paper he would sit, leaning his forehead against
the -window, and watch the freight trains pulling up the valley or the
boaters rowing on Panther Hollow lake. He liked to sit that way:
the window pane was so nice and warm with the sun shining on it.

I But in the afternoon it was all different. The neighbor's chil-
dren always played in the apartment yard under Phi1ip’s window.
He wasn’t old enough then to k1'|°W about 8¢1f-Pity 50 he Was just
envious. Often he imagined himself down with_ them playing hi-
spy or soccy or tag, running and shouting. Sometimes one of them
would notice him at the window and would shout up, asking about
his bad leg. That hurt him. . .he hated being conspicuous.

As he grew older the window panes and the apartments changed,
but the relation between him and the rest of the world remained the
same. It looked up to him because he was a little brighter, perhaps,
than the average, but it never considered him part of it. He was
3 story above it, and behind a glass. 1

, When he went through high school he was second highestln his
class and much complimented by the teachers, but the students hardly
spoke to him. One thing that kept him back was his bad leg. That
prevented entering any sports or even dancing. His spiritual win-
dowpane to the world, though, was nothing but “stuckupisbness.”

In college it had been a little diﬂerent. There he found other
people who lived on second floors above the playing crowd and who
had spiritual wlndowpanca that distorted things when they tried to
look through. When he considered it now he realised-he had enjoyed
himself more there than ever before. . . . '.or since, for that mat-
ter. Perhaps, that was because of Marion and Maurya.

He had met Marlon in his second year and had fallen in love with

fher. . . . .as far as his wlndowpanc would permit. But there must

have been a Pullman wimlow in front of him then, for he could
never bring himself to thinking of her asmore than ‘a jolly good
friend who was worth going "broke on. He was naturally unanno-
tlonal andthatseemedtosuithensotheyweregoodpalsuntil they

3 both graduated.

A year after he had met Marion shciintroduced hlxnto Maurya.
Ifaurya was neither good looking nor brilliant socially, but she did
have a nice smile and she never told him he was crazy when he
wanted to be serious. And that’s where his window pane mcddled
with things.

Aperson behind a glass has to be digniﬁed. If he is digniﬁed,
he can't be emotional, and those who can't be emotional never get
very far with affairs d'amour. Many times he would have liked to
smash that windowpane. . . . .but it had been there too long and
he couldn't do it.

“Damn second floors and windowpenes!" he thought, as be lit

With a sheaf of red and blue
graphs depicting the blunderings of
the seniors and as many more puz-
zling charts with low scores, Dr.
Sones says the results were “per-
fect.” “The results show a group of
normal distribution and satisfy the
expectations that I had,” he said.
The same test was also given to a
group of graduate students and a
group of high school seniors. The
highest score on the graduate group
was 52 and the lowest 29. Almost
the same questions were missed by
this group as by the senior group.

the graduate students showed a
greater homogeneity and a narrower
range of scores than did the high
school or college groups. - ~ - » ~

rent events gives the student a wider

he stated.

The Pitt riﬂe team ‘has broughti

another year of successful competi-
tion to a close. A great deal of the
success of the team is due to the
efforts of Coach Harter, who worked
wonders, considerinf that he was
handicapped by a ack of veteran
shots and insufficient facilities for
the training of new men. In spite
of these difficulties the Pitt sharp-
shooters won most of their matches,
and tied with the University of
Pennsylvania for third place‘ in
Pennsylvania and West Virginia
League. Outstanding on the credit
side of the ledger are wins over the
United States ‘Naval Academy, Car-
negie Tech, City College of New
York and Virginia Military Academy.
The Panthers lost hard -fou ht
matches to Penn State, West ir-
ginia and Virginia Polytechnic In-
stitute.

The sharpshooters topped it their
season with an informal lunc eon at
the Faculty ‘Club. Various trophies
and honors won by team. mem-
bers durin the season were present-
ed to the ocal sharpsl.-oters. Hor-
ner, who copped third lace in the
recent~shou1de‘r-to-shoul er match at
Carnegie Tech, won the handsome
trophy for averaging better than 272
out of a possible: 800 for the entire
season.

-FROM GRID PRACTICE

Shift Fox To Center Position
In Effort To Find Cutler
Successor

 

As the s ring training gets’ under
oach John B. Sutherland’s
hopes. seem to be dwindling at each
practice, as the number of men pres-
ent continues to grow less.- In spite
of_ Jack's decision not to drop any
willing man from the squad, the hun-
dred and seventeen men who re-
ported the first day of tactics, have
_een cut almost in ha by voluntary
absences from the ﬁeld. Dave
Stuart,-football manager, says, “We
will not tolerate continual lack of at-

1 A tendance from practice, and three
' such-offenses without legitimate ex-

cuses will result in the suspension
of the culprit from the team.”
The drilling. of the remaining

1 ‘squad, however, will continue for six

more weeks. It is the coaches’ in-
ten_t_ion1..to drill the new men con-'
in the fundamental tactics
of the Sutherland game-—.-the game
that took the Panther tothe Paciﬁc.

 Due to the graduation of Cutler,

P-itt’s center’ of last year, and as no
successor looms in the horizon, Cap-
tain Alec Fox, guard of last year,
has shifted his ppsition to the mid-
dle of the line, 's own place being
filled by Tully, tackle of last sea-
son’s freshman’ team. .

..In the tentative lineup of the ﬁrst

‘squad, Dr. Sutherland has placed

Fox "at "center, Montgomery and
Tully as guards, Getto and Klinger
as. tackles, and Donchess and Gua-
rino on the ends. In the backﬁeld,
he has chosen Edwards to call sig-
nals,‘ Walenchas "and Parkinson as
halfs, and Hood as full. The line-
up means little as the practice is
young, and no places are. ever as-
sured on a football squad. '

Anthony ‘ Czierwinskl, president of

the Polish Club, addressed the mem- 11

bers in the absence of Paul F.
Shupp, assistant professor.‘ of his-
tory, at the last meeting, March 30,
in the. Vocational Building.

The next meeting of the club will
be held in«.the International Insti-
tute, 3525 Forbes street, April’27.

APPROVE LIBERAL,
POLISH BY-LAWS

Constitutions for the Liberal and
Polish Students’ clubs were unani-
mously approved at a meeting of the
student‘ relations committee of Stu-
dent Council at a meeting in Heinz
house last week. These clubs had-
previously submitted drafts of their
constitutions, but committee approval
was withheld. until changes advised
by the committee were made.

Changes in the constitution ofthe
Liberal club included an amendment
by which the group will. annually
elect a faculty committee of five,

to supervise investigations. and sur-
veys the club may undertake and.-. in
addition approve all speakers who
speak on programs of t e
tion. The faculty committee. elected
for the remainder of the semester ‘is
Dr. Colston E. Warne, assistant pro-
fessor :of economics; _Dr. Ralph’ _S.
Boots, professor of political science;
Dr. B. J. Hovde, associate professor
of history; Dr. O_liver L. Reiser, as-
sistant professor of philosophy, and-

professor of sociology.

Because theconstitution ﬁrst sub-
mitted by the Polish Students’. club
was not in ﬁnal form and group. or-
ganization incomplete, the commit-
tee had denied it recognition. An-
thony Czevenskie, Col. ’29, is presi-
dent and sponsor of the club.

A petition of Phi Kappa fraternity
to ho d a formal dance April 18 was
granted at this meeting. The com-
mittee further decided to include the
pamphlet of “Rules and Suggestions
