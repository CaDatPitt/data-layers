We landed at Colombo in the
early morning and started’ immedi-
ately on a trip inland by automo-
bile to the ancient and modern town
of Kandy. situ- ' '
ated seventy-two

highlands.
This was our
ﬁrst long ride in
a, tropical, ‘coun-
try. We ‘passed
through" a _suc-
cession of stately.
cocoanut palm
groves . and ' rice
paddies, every
1 i t t 1 e. valley-
where water was
abundant ‘having
these paddie-s
stretched . out in
terraces. ‘ . V
- At first the" road ran through
comparatively v level country, then
,we~began ascending ‘scenic moun-
tain roads with sharp . hair-p.in~
curves, and were soon_ passing the
picturesque tea‘ plantations, the best
‘tea being grown on the hill sides
at comparatively high_.elevati_ons'.
The green rice paddies in the little
valleys and the groves of cocoa
palms were to be seen everywhere
to the .end of our journey.‘ We
passed; through many interesting
villages and the entire. road was
lined on both sides with the charac-
teristic _mud} huts, most of them be-
ing picturesquely situated in the
cool shade. of the palm groves.
Coming directly from India,
where the country people seem woe-
begone an‘d melancholly, and where
we never heard pa laugh, or seldom
saw a smile, and where the children
never learned:-: to play, we expected
to have a similar experience here‘.
But to our great surprise, the peo-
ple of this island are entirely dif-
ferent. - They seem to be well fed,
prosperous and cheerful. 1 shall al-
ways remember. the children of Cey-
lon because of their cheerfulness
and their courtesy; to us. They gave
us an almost continuous greeting‘ of
joyous smiles, Awhile waving their
little brown hands and calling to us
in a language which we" could not
understand.

We spent the next; day . driving‘ to

other. These hotels are situated on
.the coast, about seven, miles apart
and are luxuriously modern.
of them has a ﬁne bathing, beach
and; is situated in one of. Geylon’s

We drove for about ten, miles’
along" a hard-surfaced boulevard
which paralleled the coast, and
which was. lined by the residences
of rich foreigners. They call them
bungalows, but the, name seems to
me to be‘ a misnomer for a resi-

in grounds so spacious. '

The native quarter of the city is
known as; the, Pettah where‘ we saw
petticoated Sing-alese and shaven
headecd Tamils. Here. we found the
native shops called; ‘_bontiques”

squatting “chetties; or money-lend_-

strips of palm-leaves.

_ers_ Q at his death;

can -even talk about as" ‘artists. ‘
This exhibit" shows
some of his best moods,.tlie whimsi-

have
ever possessed greater strength of
line,; and no one, to our estimation,
could handle massesiof light -and
shadow by meansV'of line quite so"
well. _We haven’t had -much Davies

The‘ script‘ of.a_" most amazing‘
playcame into our hands the other
day. The chief - charact"e1'sV are
Mole (,Who/calks surprisingly like
V and
Toad of Toad Hall (“Jac"o‘bean_res-
idence——with bits of Tudorl Finest
house on‘ the‘ 1*iver.”) ' -With ‘the. vil-V
lains, headed . by" Chief "Weasel/,

Chief Stoat and Chief, Ferret. The

Play is A. A; Milne’s Toad_’of_ Toad
Hall, a dramatization ‘(lg I ‘l l) "of
Kenneth Grahame’s The Wt'iV1.cl"'z'7z
the _W2'llows._ V .  -

_Now, to- us, who know and love
The Wind.‘ . .it .might. seem a
mountainous impossibility: to ‘trans-
mute "the -wistfulness and whimsy
"ofthis fantasy into stuﬁ“.of drama.
 Milne, in a highly Milnish in-
t1'oducti_on, says he’ hopes .to_ have

ment, with enough of Kenneth Gra-
hame'in it to appease. _his; many

‘admirers and enough of __me' in it

to .just"ilr'y- my "name upon"theftitle

enough to omit the most. ‘beautiful

ts’ecti_ons- of The-"Wind. ._ .such ‘as

Dulce’-Domum' and The ‘Piper. at

the Gates of Dawn, for they are .. "

not dramatic stuff. " We can no

more conceive of the ‘Frz'cncl- and‘

_Helpe'r being representedv on". -the
stage than we can of Va‘ talkieaof

'Keat’s'-Ode to’ at Grecian Um,-V or a

dramatization ~ of ' Emily -Dickinson.‘

 _Milne has Wisely written." only
‘comedy, even omitting’-much of that

from the original, and-replacing ‘it
by scenes, all indubitably his ‘own,
with their delightful _whimsy._- The
court scene V (which,' by the way,
makes good satire) is all Milne; it
is.far too active for Kenneth Gra-

‘.h_am'e. .But weV‘VfolloW theﬂboaster

eree for the big tussle.

All who witnessed this encounter
must surely have been impressed by
the splendid manner in which this
game was handled by. Sarraf. It
was .a fast, important contest and
every decision meant something,
that is whjthey chose Walt‘ to per-
form such a task. He never once
lost sight ‘of tlie-importance of ac-
curate decisions and both teams
were satisﬁed with the brand of of-

: ‘Nineteen Cinderpath Men.'l'o

Compete Against. Ohio.
Team

 

Old man Dope and“ the. weather‘
man have conspired against the
Panther spikersg, and it looks‘ like a
long, week-end for Frank Shea’s‘
boys. All the predictions are to the

' effect that Ohio State will kind of
trample the boys from the Oakland

University under the proverbial

Now along comes plenty of April
showers and holds. up training plans
something scandalous.. It would be
enough on Pickard and" company to
stack‘-up‘ against the Buckeyes, with
severalgoods weeks of training be-
hind’ them, but this has "been im-
possible. Tomorrow is the day, and
there hasn't been two decent suc-
cessive training days for the past

_two weeks.

Despite the fact that they have
been picked to lose by a rather de-
cisive score, and even if the weather
man has a. grudge against them, the

,Pitt team will‘ put"up a real scrap.

Pete Bowen and Ed Knoblock are
the two gentlemen on the team who

are’ going to have the toughest day-

ahead of them. Reg-gie will ‘stack
up a. ainst Simpson? and Kriss, both:
of w om have reputations of being.
pretty fair sprinters. In fact, they
3;:-e just about the best in'~the Big
en. _ \
Ohio Boastslsprinters
. Bowen has several victories to- his
credit over Kriss, but he has never

faced Simpson, who is the better of j

the pair. He will have to race these
boys. in the 100 to start the day,
rest a few _minutes,and"'then. be’ sent
against the Buckeyes’ best in the
quarter. mile. This, by the way,
isn't going to be, a lot softer. pick-
ings“ than the 100.. They have a
long, disconnected Western Pennsyl-
vanian out there by the. -name of
Strother, who will probably run
about a 49 plus quarter. That means
Perle will have to at‘ right down
around 49 flat to ta 9. him. After‘
this rather mild exercise Bowen will
stack up against Simpson. and Kriss
again in the 220. ' .
Knobloclq has to face’ Rockaway
and Crooks, two very good hurdlers,

0’Loughlin has decided-to glve all

Jacobs is_ now the recognized
champion of the school," ‘having
beaten By Baur in theﬁnals of the
Seymour cup tournament this fall.

The-youthful Panther "star has also A

the distinction of beingthe former
national boy champion, and now
holds the'Virginia and Maryland
state championships. With Jacobs
at the -top of his game, he will be
hard to*beat, and at this time‘ there
is no outstanding Panther oppo-
