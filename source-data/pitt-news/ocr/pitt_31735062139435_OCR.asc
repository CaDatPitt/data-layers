Far Eastern War
Imminent, States
Chinese Leader

"Dr. Koo Finds Non-Recognition

Method For Averting War;
Warns Against Japan

“The situation in the £F‘ai_' East is
drifting toward War. You may ex-
pect something critical there by 1936.
Japan has laid down a challenge.”

These words were spoken by Dr.
T. Z. Koo, -Chinese religious leader,
Friday before the noon luncheon
forum groups under the sponsorship
of the YM-VVCA and the YM-WHA at

the YMHA building on Belleﬁeld ave-
nue

“Concerning the situation in the
Far East, there are three aspects
which stand out. The aspect of China
versus Japan is a situation which al-
though quiet now shows unmistakable
signs of ﬂaring up due to the open
wound in Manchuria. Between Russia.
and Japan there is a heightening ten-
sion of fea.r. But the European and
American attitude toward Japan is
the most important, especially with
regard to the Washington treaty.”

“What can we do to avert war?”
Dr. Koo asked. "Can we develop
any method of attack that will be ef-
fective in stopping a nation bent on
war? Personally I believe that a
great deal may be attained if nations
would pursue a policy of non-recog-
nition in cases like the Manchukuo
episode or a policy of economic isola-
tion of a country which refuses to
work in concert. We- shall only be
successful in our ﬁght for peace if
nations recognize the necessity of
working together,” the _speaker de-
clared.

“The people of the United -States
have little real interest in world
events.” Dr. Koo said. “The foreign
policy of this nation changes from ad-
ministration to administration."

The -Chinese are preparing silently
for a conflict with Japan, the Oriental
leader believes.

Technological Advance, Opportunities
For New Leisure Stressed By Dean

Leaving bombast and blast to
others, Dr. Herbert L. Spencer, new
dean of the College, in a quiet, un-
ruffled talk loaded with innuendo, ap-
peared for the ﬁrst time before a
group of students from that school
Friday morning.

Dr. Spencer discussed “The college
student of tomorrow” before an audi-
ence of about 300 students at Memorial
hall during a free third hour.

“The student of tomorrow must be
better prepared for leisure,” Dr. Spen-
cer declared. “Industry, though call-
ing for a. full share of trained men,
is now rapidly approaching a condi-
tion in which leisure is increasingly
becoming thrust upon its workers."

The speaker traced the tendency
toward extreme curtailment of the
labor demand through technological
improvements and cited a case in
which machine operation had re-
moved the entire labor force of a
large New Jersey rayon factory,

“But I have no fear that the machine
will swallow mankind,” he stated.
“Rather, man will continue to master

Cap, Gown Loses
Director Marlatt

Former Chorus Leader Unable To
Produce Sixth Show

William Marlatt, New York stage
iinpresario, Junior League play di-
rector, former Broadway star, and di-
rector of "Cap and Gown for the past
ﬁve years, will not be back to in-
struct the male and “female” chorus
of Cap and Gown this spring.

The dance director, now producing
a Junior League show in Newark, New
Jersey, refused the offer in a letter
to Theodore W. Biddle_ assistant dear.
of men and member of the Graduate
club of Cap and Gown. In his letter
he said:

“I am extremely sorry that I will be
unable to be in Pittsburgh this spring.
An already full schedule has me tied
up until the middle of May. I have,
needless to say, always enjoyed my
engagements with Cap and Gown and
will really miss not being with the
fellows for the next production. Best
of luck.”

This statement was officially re-
leased at a meeting of the Graduate
club a.t the Hotel Schenley on Wed-
nesday.

A new director was not named at
the last meeting of the Graduate club.
the business being delayed until the
next meeting Thursday at the Hotel
Schenley.

“Manhattan Preferred,” hit show of
1930, was Marlatt's ﬁrst production at
Pitt. He siiccessively directed “VVhat’s
Up.” “The Silver Domino,” ‘‘All to the
Point," and “Hello Again,” last year’s
niusical revue.

Mr. Biddle, in charge of the student
submittances for the Cap and Gown,
show, has asked that all students}
writing books have their manuscript?
completed and turned in t.o the office'
of the dean of men, Room 801, Cathe-
dral, by "Thursday instead of Frirflay,
the previous deadline date. This;
change in date was effected so that:
the manuscripts may be discussed at
the Graduate club meeting.

Disapproval was voiced by the Grad.-
uate club at its last ineeting regard-
ing the lack of student interest in
Cap and Gown. To date there has.
been but one manuscript submitted for
approval.

The Assembly was sponsored by the
College Association, an organization
which conducts dances each semester,
the receipts of which go to make a
student loan fund, and occassionally
presents a number of assemblies for
students in the College. George
Gehres, '36, member of the Associa-
tion cabinet, introduced the speaker
Friday.

The need for more general and
broad subject matter in College
courses as opposed to the present set-
up of speciﬁc information was men-
tioned by the dean. Dr. Spencer told
of new developments in “Big Ten”
schools where more courses on the
nature of this University's freshman
survey course are conducted in an
effort to graduate more cultured stu-
dents.

In the slightly more than half hour
that he spoke, Dr. Spencer touched on
the increasing armament expenditures
of the major countries. this year. He
drew no conclusions from this fact
but left the thinking on the subject
.o his individual listeners.

° ' socially without breaking the bud-
Coeds And Consututions get

AMPUS COEIDS are looking at

SFA with questioning eyes. But
the query concerns next year's S-FA
and women’s chances of obtaining
seats on it. Only four women stu-
dents are seated this year, a. propor-
tion of one to ten. According to reg-
istration ﬁgures representation should
be approximately one to three. The
present constitution makes no special

provision for the election of women
to the body, The entire question of
representation has been given to a
constitutional committee for investi-
gation.

At present the committee is con-
fronted with the question of whether
women should be guaranteed repre-
sentation by constitutional provision,
and if so, should this representation
be based on registration, or should
women be given equal representation
with men. As the chances for equal
representation by constitutional
amendment are remote, practical com-
mittee discussion is revolving about
the question of whether women should
ask for a speciﬁc representation, or
remain content with seating as many
women as draw sufficient votes at the
regular campus election to merit the
appointment.

If women get their registrational
quota, they will be still be a minority
group, outvoted and outnumbered
three to one. If they don't ask for a
deﬁnite representation by constitu-
tional provision they may be outnum-
bered 40 to 0, or they may do the
outnumbering and outvoting. At least

‘they will not be doomed to perpetual

minority, nor will they owe eternal
gratitude to the men for what they.
have allowed them.

If they are guaranteed nothing but
what they go out and get, they may
seat any number from zero up. It
would be a gamble certainly, but a
gamble in which the odds would be
well worth the trouble. M. R.

Another Bankruptcy!

 UP ANOTHER business
failure, but this time it’s Cupid
and not Old Man Depression who is
to blame. The date bureaus estab-
lished on the University of Tennessee
campus as a means of aiding socially
inept swains is a thing of the past.
So many friendships were established
through the bureau that students
were able to get dated without its aid.

For a nominal fee, men students
could look over a list of girls, accom-
panied by pictures, and negotiate for
an engagement. But the coed mana-
ger was too zealous. She became a
Tennessee cupid, following up each
date with suggestions and encourage-
mcnts, and as a. consequence the hu-
reau defeated itself. Tennessee stu-
dents will have to fend for themselves
hereafter.

Many such bureaus have been es-
tablished on campuses throughout the
country during the last two or three
years. The reason generally given out
by the proprietor is that in large com-
muting schools, students have little
opportunity to make social contacts
outside the big campus formal and
informal dances which are too expen-
sive for depression budgets, So as a
panacea for the lonely girl, lonelier
boy and emptiest pocketbook, date bu-
reaus have sprung into being.

Institutions of higher education
which require dating bureaus to give
men and women a chance to become
better acquainted are faulty institu-
tions. A university or college which
fosters a coeducational enrollment
should hold itself morally responsible
to set-up natural, inexpensive occa-
sions at which men and Women may
meet.

Date bureaus set up an artiﬁcial
system which should never be forced
into being, let alone tolerated by a
university. Our own University, by
sponsoring free mixed dances for
freshman men and women to which
outstanding upperclass leaders are
hosts, endeavor to provide channels
for acquaintanceships in the ﬁrst year,
Individual women’s classes continue
these mixers for low sums of a dime
or 15 cents, and upperclassmen and
women can therefore meet and be-
come better acquainted. Dances are
supplemented by numerous teas and
assemblies of a purely social nature.
The Pitt Players, C'wen-Druid and
Mortar Board tea dances all offer op-
portunities for men and women on
campus to become better acquainted

These affairs are only what is right
and expected of a coeducational insti-
tution to offer to its members. So date
bureaus don’t go bankrupt on the
Pitt campus. ‘We don’t need them
now, and there is no sign of a need
for them in the future. M. R.

Twelve Young Men

From The Pittsburgh Press

A dozen young fellows of tender age
and low rank in Wall street, a few
days ago drafted a statement on the
present opportunities for poor but am-
bitious youth.

They sent. their declaration to a
dozen or so of the biggest men in
Wall street and to some others of
the biggest men in American life, and
they got answers. Most of the big
men saw only the safe and sane
avowal of loyalty to American institu-
tions and traditions, and not one com-
mented on the crucial paragraph,

Said the 12 young men: “There is
an undercurrent of resentment in
youth today. In a way there is being
built up an aristocracy of American
business leadership, because the op-
portunities of business leadership are
fast becoming closed avenues to youth,
with an exception to those of Wealth
and social standing.”

We believe that the big men should
have marked that paragraph well_ It
was born of the heartbreaks of eager
and able but impecunic-us youth. Re-
stricted by passing frontiers and en-
tering great brokerage, banking or
business houses in America, these
have seen themselves passed up by
a steady succession of sons of wealthy
families, many with inferior qualifi-
cations but pull, on their way to the
top.

A question the 12 young men might
have asked was: How much of cur-
rent failing of quick, aggressive
adaptability to changing demands of
business leadership is due to the
presence of too many pampered hands
and of too many reactionary-class
minds in control positions which, un-
der freer conditions of other days,
might have been manned by bolder
leaders?

The Mail

Editor, The Pitt News:

‘The current clamoring of Senator
Huey’ Long for a new political set-up
may be of paramount interest to
many. At least the recent fraterni7.-
mg of the digniﬁed Senator with stu-
dents gives it a local ﬂavor.

Ida.ho’s Senator Willian1.A. Borah’s
interpretation of a third party is
one made up of men and women
pledged to the policy of destruction of
monopolies and the distribution of
wealth. It seems that the Senator is
a bit late for not only have the two
major parties given lip service to the
doctrines, but there have existed and
will continue to exist certain groups
to whom these doctrines have been
an old, deep-rooted conviction. Now
the man in the third row inquires
why with such a splendid idea no
group has come to the front.

The simple truth of the matter is
that there always has been a third
party. Its policies are spoken by
many today. Only its deﬁance to or-
ganization deprives it of permanent
unity. On election day it sometimes
votes Republican, on the other hanal
It may vote Democratic. zsometimes
the thoroughly irked rebels vote So-
cialist. Their ranks are numbered
by the scattered few in the rural dis-
tricts to vast numbers in the cities.
Any untenable move on their part 
commonplace, but their force is felt
on the tally sheets at the polls. Pub-
lic affluence or political dominance
never smirches their standing; they
remain the plain John Doe of national
parties,

Small organizations are their forte.
If the local public school needs a new
sidewalk or the bandstand in the park
needs to be painted, the backing usu-
ally comes from these small uniﬁed
groups. The instant any political
principle is brought forth by these
small adherents it is discovered that
the Republican or lDen1ocratic party
has usurped it, and they slowly assim-
ilate into their major organization.
Any analysis of our major political
groups shows relationship with each
other so that the welcome mat is al-
ways out for the non-party recalci-
trant whose choice is limited due to
the nature of major platform collu-
sion. The time may come when or-
ganization may permeate the rebel
ranks and lead it on to political vic-
t01‘3'. However this uniﬁcation is a
thing of the future for the goodwill
and strength of the Third Party lies
in its independence of thought.

Dealers In Death
Instruments
_ May Win .’

By Edwin P. Banks

 

HE BIG GUNS of Senatorial inves-

tigators are being turned on Am.o:--
ican munitions makers, and those
“merchants of death” seem to be hav-
ing a hard time perfecting weapons;
for the defense. Revelations of the‘
sordid activities of Du Pont, the Elec-
tric boat company, and similar con-
cerns have had their repercussions.

America and even across the water‘
to Great Britain. l

In the latter nation there is strong
probability that the English will

own—-——t0 Sir John Simon’s chagrin and 3
embarrassment. :
Masses Pay

The hoi polloi who have to pay the;
taxes to purchase cannon and poison-
ous gas, and who have to furnish the
blood are apparently becoming peeved
at the gentlemen who thrive glorious-
ly on the misery of the victims. 1‘or_.$-
ular response to the Senate inv'est.iga-3
tion indicates just how peeved they}
are. The dealers in. destruction are‘
slightly perturbed.

VVhat -Congress will do about the
private manufacture of arms is diffi-
cult to predict. There have been al-
most a dozen proposals. Some groups
have advocated drastically slashing
the proﬁts of the munitions makers.
Some favor an international embargo
of arms shipments across national
boundaries. Others have suggested
nationalizing the whole business.

Takes Profit Out Of War

Of these plans, the last appeals to '

me as the best. Nationalization would
take private proﬁt out of the arms
racket. It would eliminate the incen-
tive for spreading propaganda through
the press, for organizing such super-
patriotic groups as the Navy League,
for bribing government. officials, for
selling government patents to foreign
manufacturers, and for the rest of the
long line of malpractices of which the
munitions makers have been guilty.

But I doubt very much whether our
rugged individualists will permit Con-
gress to pass such a measure. Busi-
ness men would raise such a howl and
wave so many red ﬂags that our na-
tional representatives would probably
be frightened into adopting a com-
paratively innocuous—to the Du Ponts
and their ilk-—-alternative.

And if the alternative’ is some sort.
of proﬁt ta.x on the arms industry, the
administration of which l'>1‘0P0Sa1
would not be like taking candy from
a baby, Congress might recall that
munitions men are not the only peo-
ple who pile up wealth from war_ Con-
gress might well move to have strict
control of the proﬁts of all the indus-
tries which begin to charge fabulous-
ly high prices as soon as internation-
al conflict breaks out.

Theatre Guifd’ Fails To Present Vital
Themes In Pfays Of Year--Maurer'

By Herrymon Maurer
NUMBER. OF YEAR-S ago—ﬁvo or six, I bclieve——the Tlieatre
Guild brought to the Nixon a series of plays which still stands.

out prominently in my nieiuory.
memories: perhaps you remember

Perhaps it stands out in your
from “\Ving-s Over Europe” the

,terror produced by machines running amuck in a world unable to-

control them. And in “R. U. R.” the
robots revolted and carefully pushed
out men. There was not enough room
in the world for both men and the
machine. Again the scheme of the-
machine out of control.

Memorable Plays

OTI-I these plays upset me six
years ago. When I walked away
from the theatre my legs seemed of
the consistency of jelly. For a num-
ber of weeks after the plays I shud-
dered when I thought of them. I felt,
perliaps, that I hardly enjoyed those
pliays. But I 1'en1embered them; I
would not be willing to lose them
from my memory.
I guard also memories of “Porgy.”
I didn’t understand the play alto-
gether, but even now‘ I have impres-
Sions of dramatic tension, and of a
stalwart, lightning-lit Porgy.

Season Of Weak Plays

UT enough of recollection. The
Theatre G-uild is at the Nixon
again this year. It presented its ﬁrst
play several weeks ago. I regret to
report that that play has deserted
my memeory. I. regret, too, that few
of the plays at the Nixon this winter
are likely to be any more effective
than “Valley Forge.” Perhaps it will
be necessary for us to construct this
year’s dramatic season in memory
rather than in fact. Indeed, downtown
tlieaters will be quiet for many weeks
this winter, and the few plays that
have been announced may be pleas-
ant enough for a few hours, but they
will be ineffective the next day. The
announced list suggests that the sea-
son will be weak. Certainly today
the Theater Guild—it seems to be a
different Theater Guild from the in-
stitution of some years ago-—plays
are ﬂabby.

HERE are two signs of hope, how-
ever. First of all, there is a pos-
sibility that the Theatre Union may

Pittsburgh (16), Pa.

bring to Pittsburgh in February or-
March its play, “Stevedore,” a thor--
oughly effective presentation of race
problems. Then, too, the Pittsburgh
Playhouse has announced a series of‘
live plays, to be presented in the
auditorium of the Frick Training"
school. The plays are strong p1ays,.
not plays written with an eye on the-
box ofﬁce. They have already achieved.
a reputation. Vvhat is more, three
of the group of ﬁve are signiﬁcant in-
that they are concerned with social
problems, problems which are treated
in these plays broadly, t.horoughly..
And, not to overdo the problem play,
the playhouse presents two plays.
which have no particular connection.
with problems of society or civiliza--
tion. A well-rounded group of plays.

The list follows: “Art and Mrs. Bot—-

tle,” by Levy, will be presented this
week. In this ﬁrst play art and busi--
ness battle each other; business comes
out ahead. In January, “Meteor,” by‘
Behrman. In February, “No More-
Ladies,” by A. E_ Thomas. In March
“Chilzlren of Darkness,” by Justice»
Mayer; and in April “Spread Eagle,”
by Brooks and Lister.

The Pittsburgh Playhouse, one-
might say, is the only institution which
is likely to prevent the theatre sea-
son of this year from being as com-
plete a flop as the season of last
year. The list of plays suggests, per--
haps, that they may be of a strength
sufficient to remain in the memory.
The actors are competent. Those who-
will attend to the stage sets and to
the details of production are well--
trained. VVe may expect, then, a.
ﬁnished production of what appears.
to be an excellent series of plays_

The Pittsburgh Playhouse is an in--
stitution which deserves support and
which is likely to do more than re--
pay its supporters Let me suggest.

quite boldly that we all get on the-
bandwagon.

Panthers Show Power

in Outclassing Bisons
At Wind-Up Of Clinic

 

Loucks Leads Scoring

Spree With 18 Points;

Skip Hughes Gets Six Field Goals

By Charles A. Ruch

After Coach Carlson had told the visiting players and coaches
just how a basketball may best be put through the basket nets, his
Panther cagers illustrated his talk at the expense of a Bucknell Bison
outﬁt which showed no signs of creating a stampede at any stage of
the game Saturday night at the stadium.

Vhen the adding machines had ceased operating, the Panthers
had a grand total of 52 to show for their eiforts while the Bisons had

a not so grand total of 22 points. The

victory gives Pitt the lead in the
Eastern Intercollegiate conference
standings.

In its ﬁrst showing before the pub-
lic, the new edition of the Panther
quintet proved to one and all that the

“Win ’ein all” slogan may be no idle
thought. The boys were penetrating
the Bison defense at will and only the
fact that the shooting from close-in
was a bit erratic kept the score down
to fairly respectable ﬁgures. -
Panthers Score Early

The hands of the electric time clock
had hardly started upon their journey
when Claire Cribbs counted a basket
to put Pitt into the lead_ Thereafter,
the only problem at hand was deter-
mining just how high the ﬁgures
would go. Hughes got three baskets
and Cribbs slipped in three more to
help swell the total to 23 at the half.

Davis and Kanengiser, meanwhile,
were doing the plugging for Bucknell,
accounting for nine of the 10 points
the Bisons had at half—time_

The start of the second half
brought the start of Frank Loucks and
the Loucks Basket Barrage. In six
minutes this Little Washington soph-
omore sent the ball through the hoop
no less than ﬁve times making a total
of 10 points in six minutes. Then,
just to prove that there was no trick
to it at all, Loucks added two fouls in
succession. By this time Pitt was
sporting a 40-13 lead over Bucknell
but everyone wanted to see Loucks
make baskets.

. Gets High-Scoring Honors

Twice more the blond guard got
close enough for ﬁeld goals before he
left the game. Adding in the two-
pointer he made in the ﬁrst half,
Loucks had 18 points registered on the
books and this count gave him undis-
puted high-scoring honors for the
evening. _

Skip Hughes was getting three
baskets from the ﬁeld," meanwhile,
boosting his total to 12 for second-
place honors. Monahan, who tried
hard to keep Bucknell in the ball game
during the second half. by arching. in
four. ﬁeld goals and a foul, led the
scoring for the visitors with a total
of nine points.

Dr_ Carlson used his entire squad

in the ball game which produced

-nothing oih-or than more baskets dur-

irg the latc-r stages_ At one point
UK’ l3‘3f’S indiilgcd in a tricky session
of "i-olleo," wherein the ball was
rolled rather than passed from man
to_ man. The brief exhibition was
quite a novel introduction to the Pitt
system and caused not a few of the
Oakland district marbles champs in
the stands to look to their laurels.

In the preliminary to the varsity
encounter, Coach Dockey Kowallis
presented his freshman team in a
game with McKeesport high school.
The little Panthers .came out on the
long end of a 35-19 score.

Miles Zeleznik, former Duquesne
high star, scored ﬁve ﬁeld goals to
lead the attack for the yearlings.
Rags Radvansky, also from Duquesne,
followed Miles in the scoring race,
getting seven points from three ﬁeld
goals and a foul.

For McKee-sport Petacli, at forward,
played best. He counted eight points
on three ﬁeld ﬁbals and two foul shots.

‘Everyone of the starting combina-
tion of Zeleznik, Radvansky, Jones,
Johnson and Ed Leech had his name

Only one month remains for Earl

candidates for the varsity wrestling
team the nelson and half-nelson,
headlock, and any other grips that the
matmen may ﬁnd necessary to down
the Carnegie Tech grapplers on Jan-

The squad has been working out for
one week. The practices consist
chiefly of calisthenics and the rudi-
ments of wrestling. Some of the
veterans" of last year’s team are aid-

Sigma Alpha Epsilon Places Three Men On First Team;
Delts, Pi Kappa. Alpha Rate Two Positions

By Edwin H. Beachler

Before the lid is deﬁnitely closed on
any gridiron season, all the wise boys
get their collective heads together to
pick the perfect all-star team. Here
at Pitt, the Athletic Department rath-
er attempts to shy away at such trou-

ble. Finally, however, Mr. Feely and
his band of referees, in conjunction

-with the four semi-finalists, took the

chance. Now, these combined forces
offer the all-star Interfraternity touch
football team of 1934 for the approval
or disapproval of Greek football fans.

Here it is!, At the terminal posi-
tions are Al Truescli of Pi Kappa
Alpha on the right side, and Wayne
I-Iibbs, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, on the
left. Truesch is undoubtedly the ﬁn-
est pass-receiver in the championship
tournament. Hibbs combines receiv-
ing ability with a ﬁne defensive game.

Backfield ls Strong

Backﬁeld material was exceptional-
ly strong. Four ﬁne backs in the
Delt backﬁeld, working smoothly in
every round, were responsible for
Delta Tau De.lta’s superiority in the
tourney. Al Duff at full and Bob Da-
vis at quarter get the call over many
other aces in the backﬁeld. Dnff’s uii-
canny ability to be Johnny-on-tl1e—spot
defensively gave him an average of
better than three interceptions per
game. Davis played smart football at
quarterback for the champions. Both
were excellent passers and knew how
to handle the ball.

At the halves, Feely’s combined
forces chose Bob Detlinger, ﬁery SAE
leader, and Phi Delta ’l‘heta’s ﬁne
passer, Bill Grosscope. Detlinger was
also an accomplished kicker, while
Grosscope’s shifty running aided the
Phi Delt offense considerably.

Competition for the center position
was also hot. Paul Keiser got the call
over the others because of his accu-
rate pas-sing for Pi K A. Defensive-
ly, he rated with the best.

Material for the guard positions of-
fered only two standouts: Jack VVyeth,
of Kappa. Sigma, a 220-pounder, teams
up with another b-ig man, Jack Ruff-
ner, of the runner—up SAE combine.
Wyetli’s blocking was the class of the
tournament. Ruffner, a converted cen-
ter, not only passed the ball and
successfully took care of his man each
time, but occasionally strayed into the
ﬂat zone for a pass.

Pick Second Team

On the second team, Feely chooses
a-ﬁne pass receiver in Bill Housel of
Delta Tau Delta and Phi Delt Mar-
shall Kochman. It was Kochnian who,
in the ﬁrst round Phi Delt-Pi Lani
game, snagged the longest pass of the

tourney, a long spiraling 50-yard heave
to advance the Phi Delts to the quar-
ter-ﬁnals.

The backﬁeld contains line passers,

and runners in Ilepburn, Delt Tan,
and Kappa Sig McMunn at the
halves. Teats at quarter and S-axnian
at full represent Pi Kappa Alpha and
Phi Delta Theta, respectively, on this
team.

Louise Reizenstein, Pi Lam, and
John Roman, Pi Kappa Alpha, hold
down positions at guard. Dick lZ)a1igh-
erty of Kappa Sigma rates the second-
string center assignment.

I-Ionorable mention goes to the fol-
‘owing: (;‘-enters: Bud Baker, Delta
Tau Delta, and Bob Prince, Phi Delta
Theta. Guards: Schweppe, SAE, Gar-
man and Burtt, Phi Delta Theta, Ber-
man, Phi Epsilon Pi, and Andy Wat-
son, Phi Gamma Delta. Ends: Bill

Greek bowlers swing into action to-
morrow at the Center and Neville al-
lies as the Interfraternity champion-

Indoor Track Candidates To Start
Training In Improved Track House

 

Due to the extensive repairs that
workinen are applying to the track
and ﬁeld house, the practice sessions
slated to start last w'eek will not
get under way until the latter part
of this week.

For the last few days, carpenters
have been very busy with their ham-
mers, saws, crowbars, and other
equipment giving the track house re-
pairs which will improve conditions
for the indoor sport considerably. In
place of the old three-lane course for
the 50-yard sprint, the track has been
widened to twice that distance, per-
mitting the dash men to use. a six-
lane path for the half-century sprint.

The side of the building bordering,

the practice ﬁeld has been shorn of
weak and decayed boards, airholes,
and broken windows; the walls have
received a fresh coat of whitewash;
and the roof has been repaired.

With these improvements to help
running conditions, Coach Olson will
start work for the coming season with
the varsity relay, hurdle, ﬁeld, and
pole-vault events.

For the one-mile relay, three of last
season’s championship outfit will re-

turn. Kiger, Connelly, McDonald, and
Keller made up the team that last
season broke existing records in the
Notre Dame and Armour Tech invita-
tion meets, Of those four mentioned,
only Keller will be missing. However,
material will not be lacking for the
composition of this year's team, inas-
much as Coach Olson is well supplied
with quarter-milers with Mclvlunn,
lvlenaker, Groat, Leggin, and Tost due
to report.

In the longer distance relays, the

two and i’oui'—mile events, this year's
successful cross—country team will be
ready to display its wares on the in-
door cindr--rs. VVagenhouser, Albright,
lviusico, Kirkpatrick, Howe, Tost,
Groat, Leggin, and Connelly will bat-
tle for the four positions.

Fleming, Good, Sowiski, and Blair
will top the timbers in the hurdle
events_

Plenty of weight men will be around
to toss the shot and the 35-pound ham-
mer. Boiiavita, holder of the indoor
track record lfor the shot, Gongloff,
Hanley, Wilkins, and Avizienis, star
ﬁeld perlormer, for the fresh last
spring, will all be available.

outstanding work in industrial educa-
tion, and for her public speaking abil-
ity. I consider it a privilege to have
her speak at the University.”

tend the American Vocational Asso-
ciation convention being held this

as the introductory speaker to a se-
ries of vocational discussions sponsor-

choice of a career seriously rather
than drifting aimlessly. The. commit-
tee will give vocational information to
women about the various careers
which a woman may choose.

The discussion will begin next Mon-
day and continue from 2:30 to 4:30
o'clock at Heinz House. Betty Rie-
ger, chairman of the committee will
announce the details of the discus-
sion later.

The vocational information commit
tee is one of the sub-committees of

W’CEL transfer c.on11nittee is at work
now placing transfer women in activ-
ities. Mildred Morrow, C35, is chair-
man of the committee.

versity, will take place Saturday eve-
ning at 8 o’clock in Room 1309, Cathe-
dral. The University will uphold the
affirmative side of the question: Re-

Marguerite Swank, C35, president
of the Debating Association, will act

sion so that all interested students
will be able to attend,” says Miss
Theresa Kahn, adviser of the VVo-

search Bureau for Retail Training.

dents in the class from now until Jan-
uary 3,

off, while the six women and one man
go into service at ﬁve city department
stores in the most rushed sections of
the buildings.

As ﬂoor managers and trained as-
sistants, the retail students are put-
ting into actual practice the informa-
tion they have learned in class about
handling customers, giving informa-
tion on merchandise and managing a.
department or store. Experience thus
gathered will be used by the class
members in departmental analysis, on
which they will write their theses for
degrees.

Since the toy, gift. clothing and
stationery departments get the big-
gest rush at the Yuletide season, the
students have been assigned to handle
complaints, adjustments and irregu-
larities and arrange lunch hours.
