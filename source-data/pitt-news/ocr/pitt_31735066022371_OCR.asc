Three people were hit in a drive-by
shooting in front of Capri Pizza early
Thursday morning.

At 2:18 a.m., a suspect described as a
male in his 203, drove a beige 1991 Nissan

' gs. Maxima down the Arby’s driveway by the

ForbesAvenue Club and fired five shots,

all of which hit their three targets.
Harold Berry, 22, of Chaske Street, was

sitting by a yellow pole in front of the club

when he was hit by three shots. One shot

\hit his side, another hit his back and a third .

struck his buttocks.

Berry was hospitalized and is listed in
fair condition, but he may become .a
paraplegic, according to the police report.
Police could not interview him because he
was sedated.

Alexis Cooper was talking to Berry
when the shots were fired. She ran between
two parked cars for cover, but not before
being hit by a bullet in the hip, according
to the report. Cooper was later released

   

\.

from Presbyterian-University Hospital and
could not be reached for comment.

The third’ victim, Anthony Haughton,
was picking up bottles and cans when he
heard the shots. He ran from the scene and
was hit in the wrist and hip with shell
fragments; Haughton was " also released
after treatment. The phone number given
to police was incorrect.

According to the police report, witness
Twain McKnight saw an Enterprise Rent—a—

Police did, however, pull over a white

The car did not have a bumper sticker

Candidates

Democrats
By Kiin Palmiero
Stajf Writer

Pittsburgh School Board
candidate Liz Healy and County
Commissioner candidate Pete
Flaherty discussed ideas and
changes that need to be made in
Pittsburgh at Thursday’s meeting
of the University Democrats.

Healy, who is running against
University of Pittsbu rgh Professor
Barbara Burstin, said, “In a public
school we can have both
excellence and equality, but we
have some tough challenges
facing us.”

Healy’s concerns focused on .
improving the quality of education
in Pittsburgh public schools‘ and
encouraging children to accept
peers who are disabled. Healy,
who is the mother of a disabled
child herself, said she knows
firsthand the problems special-
needs children face.

“We exercise segregation for
children who are disabled. We
should foster opportunities for
children to be a part of the
community,” Healy said.

Another major concern targeted
by Healy was “lidentifying] high-
risk children before the third
“grade.” According to Healy,
identifying children with problems
early on would save both the
gr schools’ and the families’ money

and increase the child’s chances
for a better education.

Healy, who has a degree in
child development, noted, “We
don’t apply what we know about
kids’ development to structure

the problem of public safety in
the Oakland area “critical.”

Harmon said, “We’d like to_do
some things in terms of
developing a sensitivity within
our Pittstudents and helping them
understand or realize that they
are guests within the Oakland
community. " /

Scanlon added, “What we'd
ideally like to do is try to get
some merging here between off-
campus students with the
permanent residents to try to get
some crime watches going that
will help safety.”

According to Cannon, students
and residents need to
communicate more and-‘watch
out for each other to improve
safety.

“We've become a society where
we barricade ourselves in our
homes. We often-times don’t even
know who our neighbors are,”
Cannon said.

Although efforts to save the Syria Mosque
failed, it’s now possible to keep at least a part
of it living on. W

Beaver Valley Demolition, the company in
charge of the destruction, is selling pieces of
the Mosque. Prices start at $5 and increase
depending on the size and detail of the stone.

According to Rich DiCicco, project

supervisor, “We’re trying to save what we can

so people can have a remembrance of the

Syria Mosque.”

He said a variety of people, including art
students, contractors and neighborhood
residents have been buying the pieces.

Pieces have been selling for a variety of
reasons, but according to DiCicco, garden
stones are the most popular use. Mantel
pieces are also popular, he said.

The Pittsburgh Athletic Association has a

piece on its mantel in memory of its former
neighbor.

First—year student Jeff Long said he would
buy a piece because of the stone’s detail. “I
had never been inside, but I came to one of
the rallies before they tore it down, and that
was the first time I had seen it up close. The
work on it was so intricate. It’s quite amazing. ”

Security guard Warrenjackson said business

Deroy identified underage

in the area. He noted that the
“problems are getting worse.”

Coalition holds fair to incrse care

I By Chrissy Cullen

Staﬂ“ Wﬁter

Children, parents and giant
stuffed animals attended the fall
fair held by the Coalition for
Child Care at Pitt on the William
Pitt Union lawn last week.

“"Ihe primary goal of the fair is
to make kids visible on campus,”

said Lori Shorr, chairperson of

CCCP.

Faculty, staff and especially
students need child care that is
ﬂexible and affordable; child care
shouldbe able to fit into a parent’s
schedule, Shorr said. '

Shorr also said the fair is an
opportunity for parents to get
acquainted and support one
other.

Although Pitt does have a child-
care facility, it is not able to
adequately meet the need for
child care at Pitt, Shorr said.

Shorr said the Pitt facility, which
is located in the Bellefield Annex,

 
 

almost every other university has a
good child-care program.

Shorr and other coalition members
traveled around the country this
summer observing programs at other
universities.

Shorr said she is very hopeful
improvements will be made since
Provost Donald Henderson said he
would put child care on his agenda.

One political goal of the coalition
is to keep child care in the spotlight
so needs are not overlooked, Shorr
said.

Marcie Roberts, president of the
CGS government council brought
her son Matthew to the fair. There is
a strong need for a comprehensive
child—care program to be available,
especially for students, Roberts said.

Some of the activities at the fair
were storytelling, apple-bobbing,
face—painting, mimes, gymnastics
demonstrations, sing-alongs and a
miniparade with a pep band.

Greeks race to m ise

By Leon Fuksman
Staff Writer

Pitt Greeks raced through tires
and cones carrying caskets during
a Halloween fundraiser for
Children’s Hospital sponsored by
\X/RRK—FM, 97 Rock.

The 14 fraternity and sorority
teams raised over $300 for
Children’s Hospital, the charity
chosen by the winning team,
Theta Chi.

“It was great to see the whole
fraternity come together and help
out the kids at the hospital," said
Pitt senior Mike Cuchran, the
community—service chairperson
for Theta Chi.

Cuchran said his entire
fraternity sacrificed watching
football on a Sunday afternoon
to build the caskets for the race.

Dr. Don, the morning disc
jockey on 97 Rock, got the idea
for the race while working at
anotherstation. “This is something
I tried before, and it worked very
well,” he said.

The 97 Rock team ran the course
first. Disc jockey Kelly Pidgeon
tapped himself on the head as he
circled the cones inThree Stooges’
fashion. . .

Heinz hosts Halloween horrors

By Mike Laughlin
Staff Writer

Smoke poured onto the altar and into the
congregation as Heinz Memorial Chapel took on
a different look for its Halloween presentation
entitled, “Gothic Ghosts, Goblins and Gargoyles.”

The show was a combination of theatrics,
recitals and music enhanced by special effects.

The chapel’s organist announced the show
was about to begin by playing “Phantasia, Frei,”
from Paul Hindemith’s “Organ Sonata l”.

As the lighting rigs colored the stage a bluish
hue, three actors portrayed the cauldron scene
from.Macbeth. The scene was followed by an
actor who did a pantomime of Edgar Allen Poe’s
“The Raven,” which was read simultaneously by
another actor.

The next story was Poe’s “Tell-Tale Heart.” The
organist added to the drama by creating a
heartbeat sound on the organ. A red spotlight,
pulsating to the sound of the organ, added to the
effect visually. The story ended with a piercing
scream coming from the back of the chapel.

Bach’s “Toccata in D Minor,” also known as
the theme from “Phantom of the Opera,”
accompanied by a light show, was the evening’s
finale. I «

Patricia Gibbons, the chapel docent, spoke
before the concert about how the Gothic design
of the chapel and the organ provided the

opportunity to put on this type of show and to

appeal to a different type of audience."

Dave Patterson, an employee of Allegheny
School District, was a volunteer for the show. He
contributed and managed the special effects and
was credited by others involved, for making the
show as good as’ it was.

“It lends the chapel to other capabilities, such
as theater, music and recitals,”‘Patterson said.

David Mitchell, assistant university organist
and a doctoral candidate at Pitt, provided the
idea and the music for the show. -

“I was the one who proposed the idea,”
Mitchell said. “I’m trying to change the image of
the chapel as just a wedding mill. The building

and organ provided the possibilities for the’

show.”

their days in school.”

She explained that in an urban
school, “you get many different
kinds of children."

“Their initial, educational
experiences mustbe good ones,”
Healy said.

One issue which the Pittsburgh
public school district is likely to
face in the next year is budget
cuts.

“If we have a budget deficit,
we will lay off administrators,
not teachers,” Healy said.

She noted that in recent years
the number of administrative
positions in schools has
increased and the administrative
positions should be the first to
go.

According to Healy, the quality

THE PI'I'I‘ NEWS, Monday, November 4, 1991

of children’s education is already
suffering.

“We have kids who are
graduating that can’t spell and
read,” she said.

Healy said size is an issue in
improving the quality of
education.

“Larger schools often hurt
children. It’s easier for them to
fall through the cracks,” Healy
said.

Healy, who is supported by
both the Pittsburgh Press and
Post Gazette, said, “I’m
committed to bringing the whole
community together, not just a
few. I’m committed to working
tirelessly for education.”

Former mayor of Pittsburgh,
Pete Flaherty, addressed the
issues he would be facing as

county commissioner as well as ‘

the campaigns of Democrat
I-Iarris Wofford and Republican
Dick Thornburgh.

Flaherty explained that as a
county commissioner, he would
focus on several aspects of the
city, such as the airports, taking
care of neglected and
abused children, operating
some hospitals for the
elderly and maintaining a police
force.

“One thing we want to do is to
cooperate with the city,” Flaherty
said. I

Flaherty explained what his
duties would be as county
commissioner, describing the
post as “the executive branch
and the legislative branch
combined.” 1

When asked by UD President
Joel Leonard how the
Democratic ticket is shaping up,
Flaherty replied, “When the race
first started, the Democratic
ticket was largely vulnerable,
and I was targeted as being
vulnerable."

However, according to
Flaherty, the Democrats are in a
stronger position now.

"1 don’t think they’re going
to take an office from us. We
have an excellent ticket,”
Plaherty said.

Flaherty’ also expressed
enthusiasm for Harris Wofford’s
campaign. '

“Wofford started out 30
points behind, but now they are
just about even,” Flaherty
said. ’

 

Lee Slusser, a member of UD,
said she was impressed by
Flaherty’s personality. '

“He’s practical, and he’s down
to earth. He knows what
Pittsburgh politics consists of
on a city level, and he knows
what needs to be done,” Slusser
said. ,

said. '

Although Scanlon said she has
hope for the future and wants to
work with students to “enrich the
fabric of the community,” she
also laid down some rules for
students.

“We don’t want you to view
this as your personal pi gpen. We
don’t want you to view this as
your personal playground. We
don’t want you to view this as a
place where you have
complete disregard for your
neighbors and for the safety of
other people and yourselves,”
Scanlon said.

The seminar also included
booths set —up by campus
organizations to pass out literature
and speak one on one with
students and residents.

Literature was available about
topics ranging from sexually
transmitted diseases, rape and
alcohol to fire prevention, the
SGB’s Crime Stop program and
drug treatment.

Those who sponsored the
event expressed concern that
only 25 people attended the
seminar.

“I’m a little ticked that there
aren’t enough students and
residents here,” Scanlon said.

Andy Gould of the SGB Safety
Committee also remarked on the
poor showing. I

“I’m here representing the
students. It’s definitely not the
students representing this
program,” he said.

Candidates go head to head

A North Oakland Shuttle. A North Oakland computing

lab. Better food services. Self-defense classes. Decision
‘1991 has begun.

The campaigns for the 1991 Student Government Board
hopefuls were debated at last week’s Meet the Candidates.
Out of the 10 running, The Pitt News has chosen to
endorse the following students in their race to better
student life at the University of Pittsburgh.

Barbara Rodriguez, who intends to improve on food-

‘ service convenience for Pitt students, proved that she is

responsible enough to fulfill the commitment of her
desired position. Claiming that Roy Rogers in the Cathedral
of Learning could be opened on Sundays may sound
unrealistic, but Rodriguez’s report that she did in fact
speak with the manager of Roy Rogers concerning the
extended hours shows that she understands the importance

‘A of researching her ‘promises before making them —

something that is often painfully lacking in SGB candidates.
During his speech at Meet the Candidates, Jacob Brody
honestly stated that although he would like to organize a

V -‘student assembly to work with the Pitt administration

(much like the University Senate), realistically, the project
would not “be completed in my board term.” Candidates
in the past have often expected to be able to complete
long-term programs ‘within their terms. An explicit
understanding of the “red tape” involved in these decisions
is most often not acquired. Obviously Brody, who has the
experience necessary to improve student life, knows that

‘knowledge is better than ignorance.

Joseph Foner’s policy of “non-annoyance” also deserves
respect. For those of you who have ever attempted to

enter the Towers lobby on past election days, you know

- how difficult in can be to pass through the glass doors

without accepting at least one piece of paper from the
dozens of people scattered about soliciting them. Student
opinion is vital in order to better serve the university
community. In the tradition of present SGB President
Brent Saunders, Foner has promised to poll students as a
basis for the creation of SGB policies. Foner’s desire to
include .all students in these decisions should be
commended. Often—times, policies are designed by SGB
members to suit what they believe are students’ needs.
This is not representation‘.

Candidates Foner and Brody have contributed articles
in the past to The Pitt News. Our experiences with their ,

performance here allows us to endorse them as responsible
‘candidates. .

Gil Golden, the only running candidate for SGB president,
like the I aforementioned hopefuls, possesses qualities
which are necessary to control the SGB. Responsible and
dedicated, Golden has proven with his past experience

. that Pitt students will not be ignored by the SGB, and their

opinions will be taken into careful consideration when
decisions must be made. '

The time has come for actual student representation on
the SGB. Rodriguez, Brody and Foner are the candidates

» who we feel can make our voices be heard.

Why is the Student Government direct support of the SGB.

indifferent to the average student?
The Inter—Fraternity Council,
Panhellenic Association, Engin-
eering Student Cabinet, Pharmacy
Student Association and Nursing
Student Association all have their
own agendas, which are removed
from the concerns of the average
student. So we have the BAS and
the RSA to voice concerns. The
BAS has a valid focus, but it
represents less than 10 percent of
the campus. Will the RSA voice its
opinions on anything important?
They can’t even defend the rights
of residents. (Care for a smoke?)
How does a president of an
organization numbering close to
' 1,000 take the time to fully

If all they do is say OK, can we be
sure of -their intentions?
Accountability relies on an
outside check. The SGB has
merely built its own controllable
device to give the illusion of being
backed by the students. Student
involvement is no more apparent
in the governance groups, so to
use these groups as a basis of
student opinion is wrong. The
President’s Council is a farce of
accountability and a bluff of
student representation.

Student Council was initiated last
year in order “to allow all student
organizations the opportunity to
express their concerns” to the
SGB; existing as its own entity.
Now Gil Golden claims, “The

Visits by Brent Saunders revealed
that the RSC would be supported
if it supported the SGB. But many
wanted to voice their concerns
over the ‘SGB; Apathy grew.
Advertising stopped.

So Saunders and Golden
formed the President’s Council in
order to have “more student
opinions.” The RSC, according to
Golden, had “maybe_ 20 people”
showing up. At the last meeting of
the President’s Council, five
people attended. The RSC was
disbanded because in a span of
three months and more than 10
meetings, it had an average
attendance of 20. In three months
its replacement has had a total of
three meetings (which were all
called on short notice by the SG B)
and could only hope to have eight
people in attendance.

This may be “more efficient and
practical,” but it is not the way to
gain more student opinions.
Saunders claims that “some
groups are afraid of criticism” and
that the President’s Council will
offer constructive criticism to the
SGB. Why?

Unlike the RSC, which would
be a large coalition of small groups
uninfluenced by the need for
monetary approval by the SGB,
these larger groups must have the

Joshua Silverman’s column, “Communication Vital
for Society,” published in the Oct. 24, 1991 issue of
The Pitt News.

While I agree with the author
that our society has become S
increasingly litigation happy, I feel
it is necessary to look at the reasons behind this
trend. Mr. Silverman states, “We all complain about
how bad things are but do nothing about them.” On
the contrary, what does he think people are trying
to accomplish with some of these lawsuits? (I state
“some” because I agree that there are needless
lawsuits out there, such as in the People’s Court case
mentioned in Mr. Silverman’s column.) The main
reason these cases are filed is to prove a point and/
or covey an important message, and unfortunately
the only way to get any attention in our society is to

The SGB did not form the RSC.
Chris Wilhelm, an interested

With a ﬂourishing middle
attack, the Pitt offense rolled and
the Georgetown defense cracked,
allowing the Panthers to thrash
their Big East rivals in three straight
games.

Winning by scores of 15-10,
15-1 and 15-9, the Pitt volleyball
team used its middle hitters, Sue
Zonneville and Dee MacAulay,
to riddle the Hoya defense with a
combination of spikes.

Throughout the match, senior
co-captains Zonneville and
MacAulay combined for 21 kills
and not a single hitting error.
Zonneville had an outstanding
kill percentage of .765, and her
mixture of spikes kept
Georgetown back on its heels.

“lZonnevi1le] is really excellent
in mixing up her shots,” said
Panther head coach Sue
Woodstra.

“She played very consistently
in the middle.”

In the first game Georgetown
had its only lead of the entire
match, a quick 3-1 start.

However Pitt fought back. Led
by Zonneville’s off—speed shots,

 the Panthers took a 10-5

advantage.

Stringent defense by MacAulay
and sophomore Anne Marie
Lucanie allowed Pitt to close out

the game, 15-10.

Despite losing game one,
Georgetown played its best
volleyball of the match.

The Hoyas had good
performances from German
import Simone Kollmann and
junior Miek Weaver. Each had a
team— leading 10 kills, and
Kollmann also led the Hoyas with
10 digs.

Pitt ran off 13 straight points in
game two and won easily, 15-1.
Again Zonneville and MacAulay
dominated the middle. Both
blocked well, and both supplied
the Panthers with offensive
firepower in the middle.

With the middle attack working
so well, the outside attack also
opened up.

Lucanie had 13 kills and a kill '

percentage of .440, enabling her
to dominate the left side of the
court. _

Seniors Linda Zols and Heather
Hollands also played well on the
outside.

Zols had 10 kills, while Holland
contributed three key kills to the
winning cause.

By the beginning of game three,
the Panthers were powered by
efficient play.

Good passing, good setting and
spiking had put them in the
position to send the Hoyas home
early.

Rugby Club dominates

By Derek Wﬂlis
Asst. Sports Editor

The Panther Rugby Football
Club overpowered rival Penn State
on Saturday, coming away from
State College with a 20-3 victory.

The win upped the Panthers’
collegiate record to 4-0. Pitt has
one loss overall, at the hands of a
men’s club team. The win should
also boost the team in the
Allegheny Rugby Union ratings,
possibly to third or fourth.

Penn State scored the only
points of the first half on a penalty
kick, giving the Nittany Lions a 3-
0 halftime lead. But the Panthers

roared back in the second period,
physically dominating the ﬁeld
of play.

“I don’t think they expected us
to play that hard throughout the
game,” said ‘Pitt’s John Lewis,
who tallied a try Saturday. The
other scores were provided by
Brian Hannen, Doug Pastor and

' captain Bill Reed. Pastor added

two after tries.
“They really expected to just
come in and win,” Lewis said. “I

think they expected us to give up ,_

after they ‘got the lead, but we

stuck it out, even with some of

the calls going against us.”
Several Pitt players voiced their

opinions about the referees,
saying that they were biased
toward Penn State. “It was really
bad," said team member J. R.
Winterhalter. “Since Penn State is

really the only team in that area,

it seemed like the officials wanted
to give them the’ calls, to show
them that [Penn State] needed the
ofﬁcials.” I

Lewis agreed, saying, “Some of

S the calls were really outrageous.

They took away some of the
momentum.”

Still, Pitt overcame the
officiating and numerous injuries,
which have depleted the squad,
to win. “Last year we wouldn’t

Penn State in 20-Bwm

have beaten them,”. Lewis said.
“The credit really has to go to our

coach, Tom Miller, for the way he _

organized us.”

The .Panthers were scheduled
to compete in a tournament in
Radford, Va., next weekend, but

the club is looking into the _

possibility of playing West
Virginia at home instead. Lewis
said injuries and the loss of some
players make it tough.for the
team to take a full squad to
Virginia.

Since the club is not financially
supported by the university, the
team members provide their own
transportation to matches.

Few bright spots for 5-4 Panthers after

Oh, what a difference a month makes.
Four weeks ago the Pitt Panthers were
undefeated, ranked and appeared headed
for a winning season, which was something
that eluded them last year. Now the 5-4
Panthers are unranked, and it looks as
though they won’t even get a bowl bid.

When Pitt, played Syracuse two weeks
ago, several bowl scouts were in
attendance. Representatives from the Gator
Bowl, Hall of Fame Bowl andJohn Hancock
Bowl were impressed with a Pitt team that
rebounded nicely from a devastating loss
to Notre Dame only to lose to Syracuse in
the final seconds. The next week Pitt
played a good East Carolina team and
once again lost the game in the last
minute.

Last week the Panthers seemed assured
of receiving a bid if they could beat both
Boston College and~Rutgers, the two teams

 

appearing on their schedule before bowl

‘invitations were handed out. After

Saturday’s 38-12 loss to BC, which was 2-
5 heading into the contest, Pitt’s chances
of receiving a bowl invitation don’t look
that great. Slim, at best. '

Brandy L.  
Simms

Besides the possibility of not getting a
bowl bid, the Panthers are also staring at
the possibility of consecutive losing
seasons. That hasn’t happened since the
1971 and ’72 seasons, when the Panthers
finished under .500.

This year Pitt wasn’t expected to do
much of anything, let alone win five

football games. This was seen as a
rebuilding year for a team that had gone 3-

 

7-1 the previous one. .
The Panthers opened the year with a

impressive win over West Virginia on
national television. They then proceeded
to beat four more teams, culminating with
a 24-20 win over Maryland. In the process,
Pitt moved into the polls, where they were

-~-ranked .as high as 12th by the Associated

Press. The outlook for this team seemed
promising. ' V

Notre Dame was next on the gchedule.
This team was looking forward to playing
the Fighting Irish, whom they hadn’t beaten

since 1987. Spirits were high. After the 42-.

7 loss to Notre Dame, a New Year’s Day
bowl game was out of the picture, but at
least a bowl game was still possible. Then
a loss to the Orangemen for homecoming.
Then the East Carolina game made slim
possibilities even slimmer.

Saturday against‘ Boston: College Pitt.

faced probably the best 3-5 team in the
country._The Panthers got an outstanding

perfomance from Jermaine Williams, He ‘

rushed for 156 yards on 20 carries and was
Pitt’s lone bright spot on offense. On
defense, Sean Gilbert played his finest
game of the season. Other than that, there
wasn’t much to shout about.

The Panthers must now try to pick up
the pieces and move on. As tough as it
may be, they have to forget about what
has happened these past few weeks and
prepare for Rutgers and then— you know-
who. When the bowl invitations are handed
out in a couple of weeks, Pitt likely won’t
be among the several schools receiving
one. But at least they provided fans with
excitement for the first few weeks of the
season and made believers out of
nonbelievers. That’s certainly something

they can be proud of.

- The Pitt soccer team ended its
roller-coaster season last Saturday
with a tough 2-1 loss to nationally
ranked Seton Hall in South

_ Orange, NJ. The loss left the

Panthers with a league-worst
record of 0-6-2, reflecting the
conference coaches’ poll that
predicted such a finish.

Pirate forward Carmine
Pascarella scored the game-
winning goal with a little under
20 minutes left in regulation,
getting an assist from sophomore
forward Gerson Echeverry.

The game marked one of the
Panthers’ best efforts against Big
East opponents, efforts that were
few and far between for this
team.

For the first 45 minutes of the
game, Pitt played Seton Hall to a
scoreless tie, thanks to the play of
senior TimySobelman. Playing in
his last game at Pitt, Sobelman
made eight saves and held the
Pirates in check until the middle
of the second half.

“Tim played a solid game,” Pak
said. Sobelman ended the season
with six shutouts and a goals-
against average of 1.4 goals per
game.

.Seton Hall opened the scoring
10 minutes into the second half
on a direct-kick goal from
defending Big East scoring
champion John Silva. Silva, a
diminutive senior forward from
Kearny, N.J., peppered the Pitt
defense all afternoon. He
registered five 2 shots on goal.

The Panthers responded to the
Pirates’ goalwith a goal of their
own, courtesy of senior defender
Carsten Bishop, who scored an
unassisted goal with 22:47 left in
the game.

The euphoria over that goal
was short-lived, as Pascarella
added the decisive goal just three

minutes later.

For the game, the Pirates
outshot the Panthers 17-8 and
bettered Pitt in corner kicks 11-6.

The frustrating, season-ending
loss brings to a close an up-and-
down season for the Pitt soccer
team, a season that unfortunately
parallels the season of the Pitt
football team.

After defying preseason
expectations that predicted a poor
season by winning four of their
first six games, the Panthers
digressed to playing erratic soccer
down the stretch.

Pitt finished their ﬁnal 11 games
of the season with a 2-6-3 record,

In reflecting on the outcome of
the season, Pak said he felt “kind
of disgusted.”

“In looking over the season,
we started well and then struggled
a bit for the last half, or rather
two-thirds of the season,” Pak

first-year swimmer Matt Brady.
“The freshmen produced last

Brady took two first—place

Saturday.

‘Knoles was satisfied with his
team’s effort, despite race times
that were higher than desired.
“\We’re really, really tired, and the
times were not good. But our
concentration, our focus, is
extremely sharp,” Knoles said.l“It
makes it worthwhile watching
them swim slowly if I know that
they’re concentrating more.” I

The Pitt "women’s team didn’t
fare as well as the men this past
weekend. After defeating a pesky
St. Bonaventure team on Friday,
136-107, the Panthers were
soundly beaten by Big East foe
Syracuse 138.50-104.50.

After taking the first event of
the meet (400-yard medley relay),
Pitt watched the Orangewomen

PITT vs. PEN STATE
BLOOD DRIVE

Where: Forbes Quad
When: November 4th-8th

reel off eight straight swimming
victories. Syracuse was led by
sophomore Laurie Kasch, who
won both the 500- and 1,000-
yard freestyle events, and placed
second in the 200—yard butterﬂy.

Brilliant in defeat for the
Panthers were the team’s divers,
notably junior Donna Flatch and
first-year diver Kara Sixbury.
Flatch swept the one- and three-
meter events in decisive fashion,
with point totals of 238.05 and
263.25, respectively. Sixbury
placed second and third in the
same events.

“The divers did a great job,”
said head coach David Belowich.

“They did the absolute best they i

could.’’

Bel owich added that the team’s
subpar performance can be
equally attributed to fatigue and
lack of concentration.

“It’s mixed. There were some
people who swam extremely well,
timewise. And then there were
others who in one event did a
good job and then in the next
event, it was like there was
another person there,” he said.

Those comments, Belowich
said, take nothing away from the
performance of Syracuse."They
took it to us," he said. “They swam
perhaps the best dual meet that
I’ve ever seen them swim in ‘my

 11 years [at Pittl.”

Saturday’s loss put a cloud over
the Panthers’ victory over the
Lady Bonnies on Friday. In that
meet, Pitt was led by senior tri-
captain Laura-Lee Sullivan and
sophomore Jennifer Burns.
Sullivan won both the 100—yard
breast stroke and 200-yard
individual medley.

Burns, who took firsts on the
50-yard freestyle and 100—yard
back stroke, was.p1eased with

her victories. “To get two wins 

here is a big deal for me,” Burns
said.

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Monday, November 4, 1991

 

Volley

Continued from page 7

Playing fundamentally sound
volleyball, Pitt darted out to a 10-
1 lead. First-year setter Annemarie
Mernagh was solid throughout
the match. Her setting was
concise, and her hustle on the
court was nonstop.

With the middle and outside
attacks helping the Panthers,
Georgetown did its part, too.
Many hitting errors, service errors
and a low kill percentage of .123
culminated in the Hoya’s
frustration and Pitt’s victory. Good
games by junior Heidi West and
Kollmann were overshadowed
by mistakes.

Elections Committee

   STUDENT
GVERNMENT I

In game three, Pitt had good
performances from first—year
players Carrie Thornton and
Melanie Gustafson. Both played
well and got ample experience
from their subbing roles.

The Panthers won their ﬁfth
consecutive match and raised
their record to 20-6 for the year.
But Woodstra was not impressed
too much by the way her team
played.

“We played consistently and
fairly efficient,” Woodstra said.
“We did not play inspired.”

_ Woodstra explained that
Georgetown had many injuries
and was not playing at full

strength.

“Georgetown is really beat—up, ”l
Woodstra said.‘ “It’s hard to
evaluate how well we are
playing.”

Evaluating Pitt’s Big East record
is easy, as it is undefeated at 6-0.
This sets up a crucial Big East
showdown between another
undefeated conference team:
Villanova.

The Wildcats have a good
defense and should be the top
challenger for Pitt’s Big East
crown. The Villanova match is
scheduled for 2 p.m. next Sunday
afternoon at Fitzgerald Field
House.

was the team leader and most consistent all—around performer
at both ends of the ﬁeld.

On the positive side, Pitt will return several young players
who showed promise, including: Eric Prex, who led the team
in scoring in his first season at Pitt, sophomore Ted Noethling,
who worked well with Prex and finished the year as the
Panthers’ third—leading scorer, and Bob Dyer, who as a first-year
defender frequently shut down the opposition’s top scorer.
