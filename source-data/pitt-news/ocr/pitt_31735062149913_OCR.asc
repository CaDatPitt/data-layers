gifts, symbolizes the “richness and
beauty of the Lithuanian tongue,"
while a delicately carved wayside
cross represents the intense faith
of the Lithuanian people.

Presentation of a rue, the nation-
al plant of Lithuania, is symbolic
of honor. One of the children will

Will Top Last
Year’s Totals

Professional Schools
Show Highest Rise

Contrary to the belief that im-
mediate demand for skilled labor
may bring a decrease in college
enrollment, present ﬁgures dealing
with registered students in the Uni-
versity point toward a ﬁnal total 2
to 3,per‘ cent higher than last year’s.

total registration if 9,639 as compar-
ed with the 9,594 total for the ﬁrst
semester last year._

V Most noticeable increase in en-
rollment is in the professional
schools, usually considered institu-
tions which train for overcrowded
fields. The School of ’Dentistry

shows an increase of 20 per cent

.and the: School of Medicine is_up

‘ 10 per‘ cent. ~ -

‘The freshman class of 1940'has

"increased 1 percent over the pre-

vious year. The total of all under-
-'g_rauate' classes,‘ however, "remains

:the same as", last year.   .-

tion of 1,779, equal to last year’s
enrollment, but ﬁgures show .a

slight, increasebin freshman regis-

tration this year. ’‘

Registration total of the students

ment _req'uir..e’d an addition of six

niCian_ -_. ,. . . . .

Freshmen in the School of Busi-
ness Administration total 177, a
slight increase over last year’s class;
but the school total of 625.is under
the 1939 ﬁgure.

Substantial increases are noticed
in the Graduate school, and After-
noon, Evening and‘-Saturday Divi-
sion enroll-mcnt.’ The 967 students
inﬂthe Graduate school .. represent 2

VVith everything to gain and very little to

RICHARD FRANKOVICH

Kicking off the shackles of the
ﬁrst weeks of school, Richard Frank-

of Blackstone college, Virginia, will
lead the annual College association
Kick-Off dance this evening in Ho-
tel Schenley.

Dancing to the music of Neil
Buckley and his orchestra, the cou-
ples will take part in a pep rally
during the intermission. The affair
will last from 9 until 1 o’clock.

Chairman Frankovitch plans to
have Charles Bowser. whose Panth-
ers meet Missouri tomorrow after-
noon, speak at the rally. Carrying
over the enthusiasm and color of
the afternoon pep rally, the eve-
ning dance will emphasize informal-
ity, sports clothes, and a blue and
gold color scheme.

A special soft drink bar has been
set up in the supper room of the

Schenley to accommodate students
who cannot be admitted to the reg-

ular bar because of strict enforce- V

ment of the state law that minors
may not enter a place where liquor
is served primarily.

One downtown hotel was ﬁned
$100 for serving a soft drink to a
minor at its bar, and the state liquor
board agents have indicated that
they will continue to impose stiff
penalties for non-observance of the
hitherto-ignored part of the law.

Voting registration cards or other
means of identiﬁcation proving
that the student is above the legal
age must be shown to gain admit-
tance to the bar.

Tickets, priced at $1 per couple,
may be obtained from officers of the
College association or from mem-
bers of the ticket committee.

We Accept the Gift
0f :1 ‘Big People’

Appearing on the souvenir program for the (led-
icatibii of a University classroom tonight is the
legend,"‘Lithuania—-Her Gifts to \Vorld Culture.”

There 's something about this motto that makes
us put‘ aside such cracks as “another room with-
out a country” and obliges us to lean back in our
chair, to grow very grave, and to spout forth some
eyeshade philosophy.

Somehow” we feel that tonight ’s dedication isn’t
so iitnportant because it is the tenth nationality
room to be dedicated here at Pitt or because it is
theﬁrst of "four rooms which are to be completed
thisi',yea1' and thrown open for student use. I

Instead, we wonder whether this room is not a
challenge made by,a people that a culture, "a

language, and a way of life cannot be erased from “

theuworld simply-by changing the label of.a;j,c_0*un-
try'_o'n"th'e map of the world. In fact‘, wethink it is.
‘ .'.iVVcithi1ikl that t.o_night credit’ lines on the inter-
national v picture will: become obscure; that
Eufrfonpean politics and economics will be laid aside,
olvler.-shadowed by. a little room in Pittsburgh, Penn-
sylvania, mirroring on its decorated walls the en-
during culture of a lot of’-big people from a little
nation. , ‘  . ., V ’
All of which inakcs. us hope" that teaching in
this classroom be not lim.ited.t0 the energies of pro-
fcssdr and textbook, but that jtheigliithuanian Room
itself .be”sy_mbolic of what‘ nationality "rooms ad-
viser:R11th.Crawf.ord Mitchell calls “the power of
simp‘l'e things ‘to teach gracious,"intelligent 1iving.’.’

\Vell, s’long, fellows!

l  O O O by Robert Hamilton

We are a peaceful egg, but lately we have been
meditating declaring a war of our own. Not on any
nation, but on the lads in our own country who go
around sowing the seeds of fear, as the Senator would
say. .
Everybody we meet nowadays seems to have the
idea that all Hitler must do after conquering Britain,
whenand if, is to make a nasty face at America, say
“Boot” and then move in to mop up the remains.

Now we resent that. In the ﬁrst place it is a
damned insult to the capabilities of American men,
andsecondly, although we may be scared of some-
thing, we resent being toldowe are scared and to go
ﬁnd a hiding place quick.

T This defeatist attitude which has been nurtured for
some years is inﬁnitely more dangerous than any true
ﬁfthipcoluinn. If we meet anyone we know is a ﬁfth
colurniiist we will give him short shrift and a quick
burial and risk our chances with a jury. But when
we meet someone scared to death there’s nothing we
can do about it except swear. When a near majority
of the people you meet feel that way there’s nothing
you can do about it. Not even. a case-hardened tongue
like ours could take the blistering incident upon swear-
ing at each and every one of them.

Actually, we don’t think that America has much to
fear, at least not from abroad at the moment. (Think
that sentence over. It is supposed to be weighted with
signiﬁcance.) Put in round numbers, the U. S. has a
population of 125 million people approximately, while
Germany has an approximate population of 62 million.
Assuming that the ratio of ﬁghting males in each na-
tion is the same, say one to ﬁve, that gives us 25
million warriors to Germany's twelve and a half mil-
lion.

Again, assuming that the ratio of these that must
remain at home to operate essential industries, etc.,
is the same, we ﬁnd that we have approximately two
ﬁghting men to Germany’s one. This is not taking into
account the German soldiery necessary to occupy al-
ready conquered territories.

The way we feel, we have lived a very full life,
and had a lot of fun, and we sometimes think that if
we kicked off now we wouldn’t have much to Squawk
about. There are a lot of things we’d like to see and
do yet, but we feel we have experienced the essen-
tial, elementary things, and enjoyed them. Our chief
regret would be that we have not yet bred any sons
who could carry on our name and enjoy the good
fun, the good work, and the joyous responsibilities to
be found in a representative democracy.

Come to think of it, it would almost be worth the
price of admission just to see Senator Ziskind lugging
a rifle and swearing at Adolf from the front line
trenches in polysyllables.

“What’s this about this life drawing class?” Rugy
asked me with one of those knowing winks.

“Why there’s nothing about it: every Monday night,
seventh ﬂoor studio, seven-thirty to ten-thirty, ﬁfteen
cents covers costs . ”

But Rugy kept on looking
his knowing look.

Well, now, really——

That’s the way everybody
is about life drawing——that is
everybody except those bodies
who are in the class. Espe-
cially fellows look those
knowing looks when you men-
tion the subtleties of hip line
or the fullness of bosom.
And young ladies flush with
dubious delicacy when you
mention the nifty young lady
who posed in the nude.

“his knowing look . . .

I know one girl (and I’m no bragging)——her name’s
Janet-—whom I invited to come along up to the studio
the other night. When I refused: “Oh, heavens, you
mean they don’t . . . ”

And she wouldn’t think of it. I ﬁgured maybe it
was because she was a freshman, because Janet is
that, but other’_people do it too. '

People just don’t understand I guess. I remember
when I had life, class in the daytime a year or so ago
the instructor had a lot of trouble with those boys
who wash the Cathedral windows. Funny how the
window washing schedule ﬁts. inwith life classes. And
those windows didn’t need washing every week!

The way people act! The7’mod’el always faced the

‘ c1ass——not always of course, butlthis is for the story-"-

from the same side of the room as the entrance to the
studio. This made the light better and was more con-
venient. . So when people entered the -studio, every-
one was facinglthe door» ‘People were always visiting
the Cathedral, and nowrand then a couple would pop
into the studio. They=’d -saunter into the room and
shuffle along to about the‘-"middle where they’d stop

Suds Club Tryouts Now

Going 011 . . . Some Foam
By Roy Ruanc

The ﬁfth, sixth and seventh columnists were at work
at the recent. IF tea dance, or there has been a failure
to announce the pledging of independents Fred Robie,
Dick Harmon, Dave Boies and Jack Hoeveler. Frank
Miller sat across the hall at Webster Hall and listened
to the reports of the scurrying espionage agents.

The antiquated Suds Club is due for a rejuvena-
tion. Tryouts for new members and let downs for the
old are scheduled for this week-end. . . Peggy and
Sylvia, Boot and Saddle ’4() servers, expect a record
turnout, judging from the large crew of pre—season
trainees.

Larry Hugo is dc-emphasizing college football in
his own peculiar way. . . His intellectual gal, Ruth
Anne Skeehan, who teaches at “Five Points,” has Larry
trudging past the stadium to go to watch her little
local lads tussle.

But Ohio .9. Won the Game

A few of our hard-sleeping independents personally
avenged Saturday’s infamous football defeat at Ohio
State by invading Ohio’s Phi Gam house. The
brothers, including some Ohio football men, slept on
the ﬂoor.

On the hooked list is Dick “Congo” Fullerton,
who is throwing a ring Madeline Mooney’s way, come
Oct. 19 . . . Fred Schaefer, after living along side the
gal for twenty years without knowing her, and for-
getting her name on the ﬁrst ten dates, ﬁnally de-
cided he could remember her name better by giving
her his name. . . Fran Walker of Concord, Mass.,
is now Fred’s bride. . . Roland Pierce speeded his
slow talk enough to have Kay Stultz, a Delta Zet,
wearing a sparkler. . Bob Ryan shall promptly
be supplied with handkerchiefs.

Beating the Band

Being ardent sadists, we wish to inform the band
that Bob Totten is complaining of the lack of regula-
tions and the number of loop holes to the hellish

week The band, as everyone should konw, is

doing a bit of initiating this week. Easy land-
ings, Bob!

It is a secret, we are told, so do not let it

out. . . Anyone wondering why dancing was stop-

ped on the upper deck of our local river night club
might ask “the Dots.” . . D. A. Carrier and Dottie
Ridsdale, of course . . . During a summer heat wave
a Pitt lassie jitterbugged from the top deck into the
wetness below. The jit looked like a premeditated
swan dive. . . Need we say dancing was lowered
to another level.

Analysis 0f I   
B u sine sips  

By Edgar Beige! 

Last‘ month‘ many students began ,

resources for their tuition and ex-
penses. Hundreds of seniors who
will get diplomas next February are
cynically discussing the spring of
1941.

jawing about the
gram.” All of these people want
the “inside story” on unemploy-
ment; most of them hope the de-
fense program will “open a job” for
them.

Anticipating the signiﬁcant dis-
cussion of unemployment, the Uni-
versitty Bureu of Business Research
has devoted part of the October is-
sue of its monthly summary of busi-
ness and economic conditions in the
Pittsburgh district, the “Pittsburgh
Business Review,” to an explanation
of questions on unemployment.

Five Leading Questions

In a lead story, Dr. J. P. Watson,
acting director of the bureau and
professor of economics, asks and
answers ﬁve leading questions. For
dejected students hunting part time
work, only to ﬁnd that new work-
ers are not wanted, despite the in-
crease in production for war ma-
terials, Dr. Watson reveals that a
large share of the additional work
has been done by people who were
already on payrolls but who were
not fully employed. In addition
more can be made by working pres-
ent employees overtime, or employ-
ing as yet unused labor-saving ma-
chines, or more fully utilizing work-
ers now being paid for so many
hours, yet not fully using all of
those hours. Present workers will
now take up the slack, thus elimin-
ating the neccssity of hiring addi-
tional workers, to a greatextent.

Production Rises

For those who expect to clean off
the unemployment slate by voting
Republican in November, Dr. Wat-
son reveals that while production
rises to 1929--boom year—levels,
there is still unemployment. Many
forget that there was substantial un-
employment even during the 1929
high production levels; the employ-
able population has substantially
increased during the past ten years;
and “labor-saving” machinery has
been greatly improved.

Finally, the “realist” sees the na-
tional defense program as a solution
to unemployment; a substantial
number of men will be diverted
from civilian liife to military train-
ing, and provisioning the new en-
larged army will turn wheels in
many new plants. Unemployment
should decrease.

But Dr. Watson comes through
again with the rebuttal, showing
that the growth of employable pop-
ulation, and the reduction of in-
comes of families of men entering
the army, will increase the number
entering the labor market, especial-
ly the number of women.

Less Covemment Necessary,

Bowman Tells SFA at Dinner

By Jack Brady

Prospects of a bright future for
the Student Faculty Association
were both dimmed. and brightened
at the.Chancellor’s annual dinner
meeting for‘ ‘members of the asso-
ciation, when he explained that “the
 government there is, the better
people get along.”

Dr. Bowman believes that if
each of us was busy in what he
called the fulﬁllment of the per-
fection of what he or she saw best
in He, then there wouldn’t be any
question of government, conduct,
morals or manners.

“But,”. he continued, “there has
never been any university like that
because the places in which we live
make it impossible to set up such
a thing.” ,

President Joseph L.‘ Roberts. BA-

also featured reports of_the_stand-
ing committees by their chairmen.

Pitt Team Seeks Upset

Over Missouri Eleven

‘Battle of Backfields’ Predicted
For Tomorrow’s Home Opener

Continued from page one
cart, and has worked towards an improved pass defense, the department

so woefully weak last Saturday.

A great battle for individual prominence is anticipated between
Passin’ Paul Christman and George “Crack-em” Kracum. Christman’s

forte is slinging touchdown aerials,
while Kracum specializes in pound-
ing through enemy lines. Big
George also boasts of a pitching
arm of no mean ability and will
help launch the Pitt sky attack.
Jones in Shape
Pressing this duo for headlines,
are Edgar Jones, the heralded
Pitt sophomore in 1939 and Bill
Cunningham, battering ram of the
Missouri backﬁeld. Jones has still
‘to live up to the press notices that
have accompanied his presence on
the Pitt team; consequently his as-
cendant star is ﬁrst to blossom
forth in the football ﬁrmament.
Last week the Scranton ﬂyer en-
tered the contest with an injured
ba-ck, but is reported in excellent
shape for tomorrow’s battle. Cun-
ningham teamed» with Christman

in the Mules’ 40-26 triumph over
St. Louis.

Fife Ready to Go

Ralph Fife, the clean-tackling
junior guard. who missed the -en-
tire second half against the Buck-
eyes, also takeshis post at left guard
in tomorrow’s test. Several times
his shoe-string spills might have
saved some yardage i.n that ﬁasco,
had he performed at his favorite
stand.

At quarterback, Mike Sekela is
slated to hold his old position, but
junior Tommy Murphy and soph-
omore Walt West arepressing him
for the starting ber'th.'_‘ ,Murphy’s
Irish temper and ‘West’s inexpe-
rience block their promotion to the
varsity. V

Bob Thurbon’s punting should
match Christman’s despite the fact
that the latter is listed as a triple-
threat man. His value in a game
that features an aerial battle is al-
ways more evident than his kicking
worth.

Probable Lineups

The probable. starting lineup for
the Pittites shows’ Joe Rettinger
‘and Stan .,Gervel=is at ends; Captain
‘Ted Konetsky and Jack Benz again
will do close to 60-minute duty at
tackle. At guard File and Rudy
fGradisek, the veteran senior plug-
_ger,, play. alongside burly Steve
Sinco. The backﬁeld lists Sekela at
quarter, Thurbon at right half, Jones
at’ left half,” and 1<racum*a't"ru11. ‘

For the Missourians, Steuber and
Lister ﬂafnk‘ the line; Landers and
Wakemani a pair of real play-wreck-
ers ﬁll th, tackle slots; Mobile Jack
Crocker, ﬁghting tiger captain, and
senior George Ellis are at the guards
on either? side of robust Don Du-
chek, center.

Triple threat plus-—this embodies
Christman’s ro].e- at quarterback.
Cunningham bucks and blocks at
fullback _and at left half is hip-
swinging Ralph Carter. Right half-
back is in the ‘capable hands of

Panther Harriers Will Launch

Season Against Purdue Team

Pitt’s second major athletic team
to open its season will be the cross
country squad which travels to
Purdue October 12 to meet a strong
Boilermaker outﬁt.

The Panthers are expected to rely
mainly on veterans to carry the
battle to the Purdue harriers. In-
cluded in the list of standbys are
lettermen Frank McCabe, Walt
Sterner, and Al Boulanger.

The Panthers will be out to du-
plicate last year’ performance
against the Boilermakers when they
virtually swamped their opponents
by a 23-32 score. Returning from
last season’s triumph for the Blue
and Gold harriers will be Sterner
and Boulanger who ﬁnished second
and fourth respectively. Lew
Manuwal, who ﬁnished third, has
dropped out of school.

According to -coaches Olsen and
Potts, the Pitt team is rapidly round-
ing into shape and should make
their season debut in the best pos-
sibl-e condition. The outstanding
ieature of the practice drills is the
fact that a sophomore prospect has
been discovered. Although no po-
sitions are deﬁnite as yet, many fol-
lowers of the Pitt harriers expect
to see Marcus Allias, freshman ace,
pace the Panthers to a successful
campaign.

To bolster the varsity team, 01-
sen and Potts have a wealth of re-
serve material including several
members of last year’s frosh squad.
Sophomore Bob Davis and juniors
Foote, Brosky, and Saunders ap-
pear to have the necessary experi-
ence to handle the job.

More Guesses, as Though itMatters

By Phil Lynch 
The thou,ght—“Words -  are ‘ like
leaves; and where they most abound,
much fruit of sense beneath is rare-

1)’ i'ound”—is one of -gthe senile‘

quips of Alexander Pope-,2’-rehashed
by his contemporary, Phillip Lynch,
in expression of. humiliation -and
defeat of ego.

Saturday past was a glorious day
for football. It was a glorious day
for everyone . . . but me. Tulane
was a cinch to take Boston College
over the coals. Big North Carolina
had the Wake Forest game in the
bag. The Huskies had the drop on
Minnesota.

Bosh! Humbug! Dame Fortune
looked down and glared, overlooked
my lucky birthright, and snarled
with all the vengeance and wrath
of a tyrannical high school teacher.
The best that I could do was three
out of eight games, and don't think
that life has been worth living since.
But such are the trials and tribu-
lations of a prognosticator.

Football passes into its second
week today and tomorrow, and all
eyes will be on the cottonlands
where Tennessee and Duke fire
away at each other for supremacy
of the South. Another important
battle pits Nebraska against Min-
nesota.

Pitt 27—Missouri 14

Both teams have sieves for a de-
fense. The mighty Paul Christman
should have fun trying to squeeze
the pigskin through Pittsburgh’s
secondary. Pitt’s all around run-
ning and passing power should
overcome a stubborn Mule resist-
ance.

Minnesota 14—Nebra-ska '7

A real football classic. A break
may decide the game one way or
another but somehow the Gophers

from Minnesota“ have a ‘knack of

"making?-their own breaks, .The

Bierman: team has tastéd victory, a
well deserved tine against Wash-
ing,tor1."‘E?"_-».‘It is the Huskers’ initial
contest,;g-and they may still be a
little green.
Duke 7-—Tennessee 0

Wallace Wade has his Blue Devils
four deep in every position. Bob
Neyland’s Tennessee outﬁt has lost
ﬁve regulars from its Rose Bowl
squad. Bob Foxx and Butler
should harass Duke’s forward wall
but not quite enough.

West Virginia 14-—Fordham 6

Bill Kern had an uncanny knack
of tripping the best, and his mys-
terious technique, plus a darn good
Mountaineer team, are going to
score a major upset.

Texas A&M 21—Tulsa 0

Even without the mighty John
Kimbrough, the Aggies could cop
this one. But it is a pleasant
thought knowing that Big John is
in there tearing at that forward
wall.

Cornell 28—Colgate 7

This game should be a breather
for the Big Red. lt’s a senior team
and it seems that all senior teams
are subject to jinxes. Cornell is
the best in the East, and Carl
Snavely has th-em in tip top con-
dition.

Ohio State 2l—Purdue 0

Scott, Strausbaugh and Lang-
hurst. That’s about all that need
be said of the Buckeye team, hold-
ers of the Big Nine championship.

the-title. All three of these teams
have the mainstays of their last
year’s winning combinations back
to plague their opponents.

“Snuify” Hughes’ loss to the Phi
Delt team will be tremendous as he
was their offensive star, and played
outstanding ball on the defense in
the safety position. His passing
mate, Del Anderson will be back,
but the Phi Delts must have a good

Del to score points as freely as
he did last year. Lou Cox and Bob

though the hulking sophs may be
willing, they may not be able.

Clemson 14-—N. Carolina State 0

Losses of McFadden and Bryant
dim the possibilities of Frank How-
ard’s Clemson gridders. It would
take a pneumatic drill to punch their
line however. Wolipack is unex-
perienced and raw, too light to offer
any real threat.

Holy Cross 20——Louisiana State '7

Holy Cross is too fast and ex-
perienced for Bernie Moore’s Ben-
gals. Not since the “Kingfish” has
Louisiana been any threat. The
Crusaders lost but two last year
and with a little luck this year, they
may go through undefeated.

“I want all the mildness I can get,” he says. “Camels burn slower
and give me extra mildness.” Yes, Camels give all the qualities you

of costlier tobaccos preserved by slower burning. The natural mild-
ness of costlier tobaccos plus freedom from the irritating qualities
of too-fast burning. Extra pleasure—and extra value (see right).
