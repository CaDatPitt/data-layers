Expected release of Mandela viewed with caution

By Milt Klopfer
Asst. News Editor

Recent announcements of the
impending release of South

African government opposition

leader Nelson Mandela and the
legalization of his organization
were met with guarded
enthusiasm’ by concerned Pitt
faculty and students.

Dennis Brutus, Ph.D.,
chairman of the black studies
department and an exile from
South Africa, said that he was
“cautiously hopeful” about his
country's future.

“It’s fine to say that ‘we’re
going to free [Mandela]. ’ The truth
of the matter is that he is not yet
free,” said Brutus of South African
President F.W. DeKlerk’s
announcement regarding the

Congress.

More dramatic, in Brutus’
opinion, was the fact that
Mandela’s release was described
as unconditional, a point that
Brutus had been initially
suspicious of, ‘and that bans on
the ANC and 30 other opposition
groups are to be lifted. The ANC
has been outlawed since 1960,
and Mandela was jailed in 1962
for advocating a sabotage and
bombing campaign.

Dr. Ladun Anise of the political
science and black studies
departments said that DeKlerk’s

announcements “indicate a
substantial shift in the practice of
apartheid.

“The shift is welcome, even
though they are simply public
statements,” he said. “The
announcements do not touch on

leadership [of South Africa] and
the people.”

A scholar of African ‘politics,
Anise was not particularly
surprised by the announcements.
“The situation in Eastern Europe
is a signal that any government
that will not respond to the wishes
of its people is in trouble.”

Anise compares DeKlerk to
Gorbachev and sees the
announcements as an attempt to
stem the rising unrest among
South African blacks and young
people andgthe pressures from
the clergy.

One such clergyman,
Archbishop Trevor Huddleston,
a South African exile in London
and a friend of Mandela, asked
Brutus to organize a Pittsburgh
celebration of Mandela’s release,
when and if it should happen.

Brutus, call for an evening of
short speeches and refreshments.
“Anything from coffee and donuts
to champagne, depending on the
number of sponsors and
contributions,” said Brutus.

Brutus said that he plans the
celebration not only for Mandela ’s
release, but also for the progress
made in the struggle made toward
a democratic South Africa.

Celebration is not the attitude
ofjohn Merritt, group coordinator
of Pitt’s Amnesty International
Student Affiliates.

"I believe [Mandela’s] cause is
right, but I.don’t believe in_his
advocation of violence,” said
Merritt. “Amnesty International
never supported Mandela,
because he advocated violence.”

Merritt worried that the
legalization of the ANC would

government reprisals against it,
once its members are in the open.
“I doubt that the state of
emergency will be lifted, ” he said,
referring to the governmental
declaration that allows the
indefinite imprisonment without
trial of suspected criminals.
“There’s stuff happening there
every day,” he said.
Both Brutus and Anise said
that the lifting of the state of
emergency would be a necessity
for real change to take place.
Once this happens with the
release of Mandela, what Brutus
calls “the biggest fight of all” will
take place: forming a new society.
, “It would be a serious mistake
to think that the fight is over,
“said Brutus. “In some ways the
fight has begun, only now it will
take place around a conference

Book centers upset that professors use Kinko's services  

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

Many professors are knowingly violating
university policy by having instructional
materials reproduced at Kinko’s Copies,
according to Mary Bonach, director of
book centers at Pitt.

“The problem is that a lot of the faculty
aren’t going to Central Printing to have
class materials copied, and that is making
things very difficult for ‘students who are
on scholarship,” Bonach said.

Bonach said that she has received many
complaints from students on scholarship
who have credit lines at the University
Book Center.

“These students would normally just
use their credit lines to buy materials.
When professors send things to Kinko's
for copying and require that students go

there to purchase them, these scholarship
students have to put their own money
out,” she said.

Sophomore Scott McCurry said that
buying materials at Kinko’s does not
present any inconvenience to him, even
though he does have a book scholarship.

“Whenever I have to buy something at
Kinko's, I just take my receipt up to the
stadium and get reimbursed for the money
I spent. It doesn’t upset me at all when I
have to go there,” he said.

Bonach sent a memorandum to all faculty
members in December informing them of
the university’s policy concerning

instructional materials. The memo states

that “all instructional materials that are to
be sold to students must be printed in
Central Printing and sold in the Book
Center or the Health Book Center.”

"The biggest problem was that many of

the faculty members needed to be
reminded of a policy that has been in
effect since 1972,” Bonach said.

Assistant Communications professor
Sally Murphy said that she knows that
copying through Kinko’s is against
university policy, but she has continued
anyway. _ B

“I have continued after I received the
memo because it is not nearly as convenient
to copy at Central Printing as it is at
Kinko’s,” she said. “I think that there ought
to be a competitive system regarding
selling materials.”

Murphy said that she is aware of the
problem that scholarship students may be
experiencing.

“That is a real issue, and it is not one that
I takelightly. I do encourage students to
borrow packets if they cannot purchase
them, but there isn’t much else thatl can

do,” she said.

Murphy said that Central Printing is not
able to_fill copy orders as fast as Kinko’s
does.

“I tried to get my things copied at
Central Printing once, and they were not
able to prepare my materials in time. It
also seems to be cheaper for students to
go to Kinko’s,” she said.

Arthur Shuker, director of Central
Business Services, disagreed about the
costs and waiting time involved at Central
Printing.

“We have seven copy centers, and we
should be able to provide service as
quickly as Kinko’s. Some of the faculty just
need to learn to do a little bit of better
planning,” he said.

“It is not at all cheaper to copy at
Kinko's. We have compared the prices

PPC sponso rs spring

brea/e trip to Daytona

By Andrea Barczykowski
Staff Writer

For $230, the Pitt Program
Council has an incomparable
spring—break trip, according to
Dave Kadylac of the Pitt Program
Council.

“I don’t think that any other
school’s [spring-break] trip can
compete. It's an experience,
whether you drive, walk or take
our bus to. Daytona, you should
try to make it there at least once
during your four years at college,”
said Kadylac, chairman of the
PPC travel committee.

The trip, whichlasts from March
2 to March 11, includes quality
transportation , and
accommodations, free deck
par-ties, discounts from local
merchants and optional
excursions.

“We allow about 20 hours for
the trip, although last year we
made it in 15. We use the widest
buses, the most modern and
newestbuses available. [They’reI
equipped with VCRs, monitors
and stereos,” said Kadylac.

Students will be staying at the

Howardjohnson in the Clarendon’ -

Plaza, the hotel chosen two years
ago when Pitt started its spring-
break program.

u“’Ihe only thing that’s different

I is that the balconies will be open;

they've always been locked
before,” said ‘Kadylac.
According to Kadylac, another
advantage is that the hotel has a
sponsor. This year, like the last

one, Chrysler will provide for the »

students’ activities such as
volleyball and prizes such as t-

shirts. Students taking the trip
receive an I.D. card which enables
them to attend the deck parties.
Free beer is given to students
who are 21. The I.D. is also used
for discounts at certain stores as
well as clubs which sponsor “Pitt
Nights.”

As far as discipline is concerned,
there have not been any
problems. The students have not
damaged the buses or the rooms,
and they are informed that no
one under 21 can drink alcoholic
beverages. I

“The reason that we can offer
the quality hotel and buses that
other schools don’t have is that
we are a responsible group of
students,” said Kadylac.

The one problem that does
occur, especially during the after-
in May, is
overexposure to the sun.

“You have to be smart in the
sun; you’re not going to getaway
with a seven [sun protection
formu1a],” said Dana Keefer,
program coordinator for the PPC.

The PPC estimates that around
250 students will attend the spring-
break trip, and around 300 will

take the after-school trip because I

it is less expensive, and the
weather is more predictable.

“For $230, I don’t feel that
there’s a trip that matches it,” said
Kadylac.

Shuker said that his department
is also concerned about student
complaints regarding taxes and
potential problems with copyright
laws. I

“A lot of students are upset
because they have to pay tax

“Basically what we are trying to
do is to make sure that members

instances where these quick copy

following the copyright laws.”

Sara Pile, manager of Kinko’s,
said that Kinko’s fully adheres to
copyright laws.

“All of the materials and packets

problems. We have a full—time,

copyright issue,” she said.

Pile refused to comment on the
university’s policy and directed
inquiries to Kurt Koenig, vice
president for copyright and
trademark counsel.

“It is clear that Kinko’s is the
most responsible of any copy
center as far as copyright
permission goes,” Koenig said.
“Through a variety of friends that
I have in the publishing industry,
I found out that Kinko’s makes 90
percent of the requests for
copyright permission. Now, we

don’t copy 90 percent of all.

materials, so that must mean that
we are very stringent about asking
permission.” I

Koenig said that he thinks the
university’s policy is unfair to
Kinko’s.

“What they are doing is using
the copyright issue as a guise so
that they can keep the business

‘to themselves,” he said.

“It is like the university opening
a computer store and saying that
students aren’t allowed to

purchase computers anywhere
else besides at their store,” he
added.

Koenig said that the university
may be violating state competition
laws.

“It is a possibility that such a
policy .would constitute. unfair
competition, but I am not sure
that Kinko’s would pursue the
issue because it is very hard to go
up against a large university,” he
said.

Koenig said that Kinko’s is.

“The reason we add a surcharge
is because we have to pay

surcharge is there because we
are complying with the rules,” he
said.

“The truth is that I think we do

hinder it. We do ourubest to

Historical   changes in 19905

The 1980s revealed some significant changes in the
political structure of Eastern Europe. However, the,1990s
could reveal some astonishing changes in the political
structure of the world.

In 1979, as we were embarking on the 19803, the Soviet
Union —-— firmly entrenched in the policies of the Brezhnev
doctrine — began its invasion of Afghanistan. At that time,
no one knew ‘what was lurking ahead in the ’80s;

‘ certainly, a sane man would have never guessed that the

’80s would bring the demise of communism and Soviet

. control in Eastern Europe.

However, upon entering the 1990s, we already know of
some remarkable historical changes that will occur. V
Already, we have seen history made in the ’90s. A

¢ historical event occurred yesterday, which, just one year

ago, many of us could safely claim would never have
happened in our lifetimes: Sovietlleader Mikhail Gor-
bachev proposed rejecting the dreadful Article VI of the
Soviet Constitution, which monopolized Communist power
and control of the Soviet government. Merely one month
ago, Gorbachev was habitually reiterating his adamant
stance in defense of that same article. What prompted the
historical change by Gorbachev to end the 70-year

V Bolshevik legacy of Communist control in the Soviet

Union is a very intriguing question, as is the future for
Gorbachev and the Soviet Union. The 19903 may hold
more revolutionary changes for the Soviet Union than did
the 1910s and 1920s. ,

In 1992, the countries of Eastern Europe will collaborate
to join the European Economic Community, from which
a common European currency will emerge among the
participating. European nations. This could lead to the
most monolithic scenario within that continent in recent
times. ’

Also, in the ‘90s, the prospect of German reunification
is inevitable. The only remaining question is how soon.

In 1997, Hong Kong will be returned from British to
Chinese ownership: a scenario which couldshock the
world by bringing back shades of Mao's Cultural Revolu—
tion or Tiananmen Square, not to mention _a possible,
crucial diplomatic standoff between the British and the
Chinese. 'T hat potentially volatile situation will surely be
a major campaign issue in the 1996 U.S. presidential race,
as will the turning over of the Panama Canal from the
United States to Panama in 1999.

And remember, unlike the surprises of the ‘80s, these
critical events of the coming ‘90s are ones which we are
already aware of. I

If you thought the changes in the ‘80s were amazing, just
hold on —- you ain’t seen nothing yet.

I would like to point out some
of the fallacies in the anti-choice
arguments ofjoel Garrett printed
in Thursday’s Pitt News. First, I
would like to strongly agreewith
Mr-. Garrett’s position on sex
education and the need for an
increased willingness to discuss
sex in our culture. I also believe
that this would decrease the
number of abortions in this coun-
try, a desirable outcome indeed.
I would like to point out, how-
ever, that among anti—choicers
this is very much a minority opin-
ion.

In opposing Mr. Garrett’s views,
I would especially like to take
issue with his arguments that
deal with the health of the mother.
Mr. Garrett states various statis-
tics that indicate that mothers are
physically and psychologically
injured by abortion. First, one
must realize that to have an
abortion is the choice of the
mother. She can know the risks
before the procedure and make
an informed decision after weigh-
ing her perceived risks and bene-
fits. To outlaw abortion on these
grounds would be akin to out-

lawing all surgery, for all surgery‘

has many risks associated with it.

\Also, a study in this country (not.

in Britain) performed by the
Surgeon General found no evi-
dence of an increase in psycho-
logical problems after abortions.
This is in direct disagreement
with the study cited by Mr. Gar-
rett. Finally, if health is the real
issue, Mr. Garrett, then you favor
the legalization of RU-486, which
greatly increases the safety of
abortions? Right? 0   s

The second point that I would
like to make deals with the ques-
tion of “When does life begin?” It
is my contention that this is a
meaningless question. It seems
that in this country we constantly
want to make things black and
white which are in reality only
shades of gray. The point atwhich
life begins is not a matter of fact,
but only an arbitrary deﬁni-
tion. As such, it is useless to
argue about when “life” begins;
there is simply no fact of the
matter. It is like trying to decide
if something in a room is light or

not; there is no definitive answer,

, but rather it is a matter of degree.

. I would like to thank The Pitt
Newsfor impartially printing both
sides of the abortion debate in
the Thursday, Jan. 25 issue. I
found both articles, by Joel, Gar-

rett and Debra Gould, to be very’ V

informative. However, as a pro-
lifer, I am certain that many of the

L points brought up in Gould’s

   

 

article are inaccurate. For in-
stance, in her article she states

that pro—lifers’ “concern does not ,

extend to the lives of the moth-
ers.” This statement is false. I am
a member of Students for Life, a
pro-life group on’ campus which
is currently involved in’ a fund

raiser to benefit the Genesis

House. of Pittsburgh. The Gene-
sis House is a nonpartisan or-
ganization which provides coun-
seling and a -wide variety of
support services for women fac-
ing the problems of an unplanned
pregnancy. People involved in
the pro-life movement are con-
cerned with protecting the lives
of pre-born babies and their
mothers. They are aware of post-
abortion trauma and of lifelong
guilt feelings which many moth-
ers of aborted babies suffer from.
Gould goes on to state that, “There
are people in our society who
want women to produce babies,”
as if that is some horrible thing.

Actually, I am looking forward to
“producing” a few babies of my
own. She then says that, “[Pro-
lifersl want to force women to
bear unwanted children.” From
my experience volunteering at a

crisis- pregnancy center, I can

tell you that when a woman first
discovers that she is pregnant

with an “unwanted” baby, she
wants to get rid of it. After further

thought many realize that the

nine months it takes to allow the

baby to continue life shrinks into

comparison to a lifetime that an

Heated abortion debate rages on -

abortion will haunt them. I could
go on to state other examples
from Gould’s article which illus-
trate that she is grossly-misin-
formed about what pro-lifers truly
believe. But I would prefer to
ask her to become, educated
aboutwhat‘ being pro-life really
means before she tries to act as
an authority on the subject again.

homelessness. Currently, the U.S.
government spends just 1 cent of
every tax dollar on low-cost
housing (they used to spend 3
cents on every dollar). SAU, in
conjunction with Pittsburgh
Housing Now! and several na-
tional organizations, is petition-
ing the government to restore
the federal housing budget to its
previous levels. l...l
. So far, well over 2,000 Pitt stu-
dents have signed our petition
demanding that the government
spend 2 cents more of every tax
dollar on low-cost housing. SAU
will continue our quest for signa-
tures this Wednesday in the
William Pitt Union basement
between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. If
you cannot make it then, please
come to cubicle 2A on the fifth
ﬂoor of the Student Union and
sign the petition.

The  mysterious disappearance of the Sparrow Lady

Have any of you been reading
Calvin and Hobbes lately? Calvin
duplicated himself, see? He
thought it would be a great idea

A because he could send Duplicate

Calvin to school while he stayed
home. Well, it was fine until Du-
Cal got loose. While Calvin was
getting in trouble for something
Du—Cal did, Du—Cal duplicated
himself another four times. (Are
you getting all of this?) Now,
there are Calvins everywhere!
Hobbes stays with the real Calvin,
if there is such a thing, so that we
know which one is the real Calvin.
Mom and Dad Calvin are getting
really frustrated, because every
time they turn around ‘there is
another Calvin causing a prob-
lem.

Well, as we all know, there was
a distinct personage in the city of
Pittsburgh who appeared to have
that same teleportation ability:

Prison pen

Are any of your profs really
getting on your nerves? Why don’t
you just take care of them for
good? Yeah, that's right; just get
reeeal close to Dr. Detestable
and part his skull with a lump of
lead.

It’s kind of grotesque, but come
finals there will be more than one
of you out there who will be

yourself. I

Now, I know you’re out there
saying, “Hey, it's got potential,”
but the big question is how to
make it work. The answer is
simple: become his/her pen pal.

Yep, that’s right. Establishing a
correspondence with your pro-
fessor may be one of the best
ways to remove him from the
rosters. This is your chance to
break into the murdering busi-
ness and maybe even make a

Rededicozting our worldly values

Big Brother is dead. Or is
he? i I
Nineteen eighty-four is long
past, so we look through our
power windows to the future.
Televisions project the many
things we have to look forward
to: robot maids, new Ford, Es-
corts with space shuttle-like
dashes, computerized houses that
are “smarter” than we are and
talking toasters. The ’90s have
just rolled in and are here for
roughly 10 years, but what will
these years to come bring?

The United States is a kinder,
gentler nation that looks as
compassionately on Latin Amer-
ica as much as a vulture does on
lunch. Panama's Christmas pres-
ent was U.S. Invasion: the game
the whole world can play! And
the Soviets are out of Afghani-
stan, but now they’re perforating
people in Armenia.

The ’80s brought Orwell’s
1984 to mind. Crazed people
scurried about probing for the

Sparrow Lady. If you went to the
Igloo for hockey or a concert, she
was there, proclaiming the end
of the world within thenow leg-
endary “three days.” You might
have listened politely before slink-
ing away, or you may have
laughed and poked fun at her.
Maybe you ran for cover. Then
you got on the PAT bus and came
back to the Towers, thinking you
had escaped. Yet, there she would
be —- on the corner, or in front of
the stairs — saying the same
thing: “Get inside! In three days
the world will end! Repent! (etc.,
etc., etc.).”

So, why am I speaking of her in
the past tense? It’s because she

hasn’t been around since Christ- ,

mas break — or, at least, I haven't
seen her. I quizzed the newsroom.
The staff of reporters we've got
here at The PittNews should have
been able to track her down. But

nobody had seen her since Dec.
20. Curiouser and Curiouser, I
called the campus police and,
through a mouthful of donut

    

 Ji
Wechsler “

crumbs, I was told that it wasn’t

their duty to track down missing

Sparrows (juuust kiddingl).
Then, I got worried. What if

she decided to “get inside?” Did
that mean  naah! Couldn’t be.
She’s been missing for well over
three days. But, if the sky _wasn’t
really falling, where did she go?
The “O”? Probably not.

At first I laughed it off. I fore-
saw her. disappearance as na-
tional news. It would start slowly;
supermarket tabloids at the Giant.
Eagle would have interviews with
people who swear they’ve seen
her with Elvis at the Subway.
Then, somebody would organ-
ize a Sparrow search, complete
with ectoplasm meters and fed-
eral funding. Eventually, Maury
Povich would get the story:
WbateuerHappened to the Spar-
row? And then, she would end
up in a “This Day In History”
column in The Pitt News itself.

That’s when it occurred to me
that she mightreally have gone
for good, and things weren't so

funny anymore. Sparrow Lady
never failed us. Through rain,
sleet, snow or hail, she was al-
ways there to remind us of hell
and how to avoid it. She’ never
missed a beat. Never. And now
she’s gone. That’s not like her. Is

she sick? Dead (God forbid)? Or, _

is she just gone, having left Pitts-
burgh with reluctance and dis-
gust, realizing that nobody paid
attention to her message. If the
latter is the case, it sure makes
Pittsburgh“ look bad. She; who
had the patience of Job, had ﬂed
to another city to spread her
message — somewhere where
there might still be hope for the

inhabitants, if she could just get 

there within the next three days.
I don’t know which situation is ,
sadder.

Just ask ex-con Keith Eugene
Goodman or Granville H. “Pete”
Jones, an associate professor of
English at Carnegie Mellon Uni-

This sick, twisted tale spanned
the country from New York to
Mississippi to California, but it all
began in Indiana. Goodman,‘who
resided in Anderson, Ind., was
sent to prison for the burglary
and sexual assault of an 80-year-
old woman.

While in prison, he placed an
ad in a magazine asking for cor-
respondence. Goodman played
on the sympathies of his 20-some
“pen pals,” relaying prison-life
horror stories, asking for (and
receiving) money.

Jones was one of the do-good-
ers who sympathized with
Goodman and responded to his

NBC’s The Day Aﬂer sent chills

people wondered about that one
too. “How long?” we wondered.
The ’90s. Spaceships, alien
visitors, V, Space 1999, lunar bases
and planetfall. Will the new
decade be that different from the
fading ’80s? Naw, We’re stuck in
a rut. We’re chewing up the planet
for oil and raw materials to make
plastics that don’t even break
down when we dump them in
our backyard landﬁlls. The term
“nuclear waste” leaves a bad taste
in my mouth, and the words
“New Jersey” and “toxic waste”
have become the center of one-
too-many jokes. It’s _ getting

Millenium...

Panther squad could
boast four over 1,000

By Scott Campbell
Staff Writer

Scoring 1,000 points in college basketball is often considered a
crowning achievement for four hard years of work on the court. Only
a handful of players ever reach the 10—century mark, and to do so is
to be mentioned among the school’s all-time greats.

Entering this season, only 16 Pitt players had achieved such status
in 8-4 years. Less than one every five years.

This year, however, as many as four Panthers could reach the 1,000-
point plateau. Jason Matthews has already reached the mark, Jan. 13
in a 71-70 loss at St. John’s. Brian Shorter has 992 points and should
reach 1,000 this Wednesday at Georgetown. Rod Brookin and
Bobby Martin are also approaching fast, with 924 and 864 points,
respectively. Naturally, the quartet is honored to be in such
exclusive company, but they really don’t find it all that exciting.

“To be honest, I don’t think it matters all that much to any one of
us,” said Brookin. “The most important thing is to win ball games.”

Heck, Matthews isn’t even sure how he got his 1,000th point.

"I think it came on a three—point [field goal], but I’m not really sure,”

said Matthews.

ActuallyJason, it came on a free throw with 10:47 left to tie the game

at 55.

Matthews wasn’t even aware that he was close until Pitt’s sports
information department told him before the St. John’s game.

“I thought I was about 200 points away,” Matthews said. “In fact,
I didn’t evenknow 1,000 points was a great thing until I saw Jerome

_lLane] do it.”

Matthews should move into eighth place before the season ends,

passing Lane (1985-88).

“I wasn’t even thinking about it,” Shorter said when informed of his
total, “but I’ll just keep ﬂowing along. I don’t want to put any extra

pressure on myself.”

Based on his season average thus far, Shorter will end the season
in 12th place on the Pitt all—time list, but many feel he could pass

Matthews before season’s end.

“He could pass [Matthews] in two games if he wanted to,” said
Brookin, “Brian can score on anybody at will.”
“He’ll probably catch me,” Matthews said almost assuredly. “He’s

a great scorer.”

When Shorter reaches 1,000, he will only be the third Panther to
reach the mark in two years, equalling former All-Americans Don
Hennon, who did it in 1959, and Billy Knight in 1973.

“That doesn’t surprise me, he had over 2,000 points in high school,”
said Martin. “He’s capable of doing anything he wants to.”

See 1,000, page 9

More than a defensive line coach was lost in D’/llonzo

“Sweet 01’ Bill! Wake up! Hey,
Bill, you’re on in 10 seconds!”

“Talk about poor timing,
sweetheart. You, unintentionally,
I’m sure, broke up a whale of a
dream where Kathleen Turner
and Raquel Welch were fighting
like alley cats for the right to ride
shotgun in my chariot.”

...Three ...Two... One... [Cue]

Ahem... Now, over in that
lightning rod of education in
Oakland known as the University
of Pittsburgh, we find a
controversy brewing among the
ranks of the football faculty that
would give the time cousin Clara
Lou ran off and eloped with her
handsome, third-cousin milkman
a serious run for the money in
terms of divided houses.

What happened over there at
Pitt is that the popular new head

V football coach —- a fella by the

name ofHackett— pulled what is
now being called a BuddyHackett

by some folks at and around Pitt.
What he did was go ahead and
ﬁre a fella by the name of
D’Alonzo, who was regarded
simply as Pitt is best recruitersince
Zelda’s Greenhouse opened its
doors. And a lot of fellas — no,
make that a lot of big fellas ——
aren’t too happy about it.
Now the first disgruntled big
fella to voice his antithetical
disapproval was Keith Hamilton,
a defensive lineman from Virginia
who did his job well enough this
season to be named The Sporting
News Freshman DefensivePlayer
of the Year —— no third-string
long snapper here. Hamilton said
he’d consider jumping ship if
D’Alonzo wasn’t reinstated or
even ﬂat—out jumping ship with
him. Of course, hesgone back on
that threat of defiance, but I'm
sure it’s still safe to say that Mr.
Hamilton is still unhappy with
the situation, as are quite a few
other Panther footballers, like

was supposed to have surfaced.)

And now the latest casualty is
Marc Spindler, who has
proclaimed he is aborting the
collegiate life forthe luxuries of a
supposed first—round contract

with theNationalFootballLeague. ‘

He claims his decision is also
based on the infamous “Departure
ofD’Alonzo, "which sounds more
and more like a Shakespearean
tragedy as we progress here.
Now, my question to the general
public, orany football swami with
any respectable inside
information, is what was so
consummately appealing about
thisM r. D’Alortzo, so much that it
is now at the point where his
dismissal is causing moreground—
level turbulence than when the
former head—man Gottfried
himself was dismissed?
I took the liberty of asking one

of his recruits.

"He was a friendly type of guy, "
Riddick told me. “He treated you
when he was recruiting you like
he treated you when he was here.
He got along great with my

. parents; he got along great with

me.

”You could talk about anything
with him. He was one of the guys.
You could sit around and get
drunk with him, and when it
came to teaching football, he
could do that ... He touched some
guys personally. Hell, he touched
me personally. But the sooner its
all overand done with, the better. _
Its causing too much of a
disturbance within the team.”

Now, Lou, has Coach Hackett
given anyexplanation to the team
for his action?

“No, he's a professional. He
hasn’t said anything about it to
anyone. I ‘m sure he had his
reasons, though.”

Wrestlers

By Geoff Moskowitz
Staff Writer

The 16th-ranked Bloomsburg
Huskies wrestling team (12-6)
mushed into Fitzgerald Field
House Friday night and put a
chill over the Panthers by beating
them 51-6.

The only Panther victory was
recorded swiftly by Bob Simpson,
who pinned freshman K0 Matsui
after amassing a 15-5 lead.

The Huskies are current, and
last year’s, champions of the
Pennsylvania State Athletic
Conference.

Simpson dropped to the 118-
pound weight class, and left sixth-
ranked Dave Kennedy (24-2) of
the Huskies for out-manned Sean
Moffit at 126. Kennedy recorded
a major decision, and the Huskies
proceeded to roll off 31 straight
points.

The Panthers’ Brian Shaffer (9-

Uncharacteristically, Alan Utter
(26-8-1) wrestled an uninspired
match against Huskie T om

“Alan’s the kind of kid who has
got to show up every match to
win. He has a tendency to get
tight, then he can’t relax and
wrestle like he’s capable of
wrestling,” Pitt Coach Rande

The backbreaker for the
Panthers came in the shape of
two consecutive 5-4 losses at 158

wrestled tough, but were unable
to score in the ﬁnal seconds of
their matches to escape defeat.

In response to Spindler’s
decision, Hacleett told The
Pittsburgh Post—Gazette, “Any
time there’s a change of that
nature, there are going to be
feelings of individual players one
way or another. Marc and I have
talleed for hours about it. And I
understand his standpoint.
Obviously, I’m disappointed.
We ’re disappointed.”
Everyone’s disappointed, it

seems. Being around all of this
disappointment, I ’m gettin’ to be
a little disappointed myself.

Riddicle’s hit the railroad spike
smack on the head — the best
ointment to end all of this
disappointment is for Hacleett to
appoint a new, friendly recruiter
who the players can sit around
and get drunk with.

I'm sure a whole slew of Pitt
fans will raise a glass high to that.

“He’s had two great years,"
said Pitt Coach Paul Evans. “We
look to get him the ball inside, so
he’s going to score a lot.”

When asked how he’d like to
reach the magic number, Shorter
responded, “I don’t know, on a
dunk I guess,”

Well, any particular kind of
dunk, Brian?

“A dunk on somebody’s head,”
he said with a grin.

If all four players make the
grade, it will be the first time that
Pitt has had more than two players

Brookin’s eligibility is up after
this year, while the other three
each have another year left.

‘ “It’ll be great. We have a lot of
talent on this team, so we should
get a lot of recognition from it,”
Shorter said.

“We play a wide—open kind of
game where we score a lot, ” said
Evans, “so I guess we’re bound to

Pitt gymnasts ma/ee up for team losses

By John Labriola
Staff Writer

The Lady Panther gymnastics
team’s record took a dive this
past weekend, after it placed
fifth in the Purina Cat Classic
with a score of 181, sinking its
record to 0-10.

The Lady Panthers started
Friday night’s competition on the
uneven parallel bars before a
crowd of over 4,000 spectators.

Strong performances for the
Lady Panthers on the uneven
parallel bars were turned in by
Kathy Wallish (9.20), Kristin
Brown (9.10) and Kim Miller
(8.90).

“Kim received her highest Score
of the year, but it wasn’t her best
routine;" said Coach Debbie
Yohman. “She really expected to
have a strong routine, she just
got too excited before she started
and didn’t do a good job. That
was probably one of the few
disappointments of the meet."

The Lady Panthers received a
bypass for their next event, and

the Pitt coaches, Yohman and A

assistant coach Ben Rovee, took
the Pitt squad into the locker
room. 9

_ everybody

“We went into the locker room
and talked about some things.
There were some people who
were a little disappointed after
bars — Robyn [Borchers] in
particular. Kristin [Brown] was
disappointed because she felt she
should have had a better score,”
said Yohman.

Borchers received a 7.75 on the
uneven parallel bars.

“Basically we took the whole
team off of the gym floor so they
wouldn't be sitting and watching
the other competitors, and we
spoke to those two directly, and
in general,” said
Yohman.

“Probably what we will do for
the ECACS and regionals is 
something to divert the kids’
attention during the byl-pass], give
them something to read or give
them coloring books or whatever,
something to take their minds off
of the competition, and then give
them the last half of the by-
rotation to start warming up
again,” added Yohman.

Yohman and Rovee’s little pep
talk did the trick, as the Lady
Panthers came out and performed
excellently. The Pitt squad turned
in three performances above a

nine and three performances that
were slightly below nines.

Scores in excess of 9.0 were
turned in by Brown (9.45), Gina
Venezia (9.40) and Borchers
(9.30), while scores of just below
9.0 were turned in by Shelly
Sleith (8.95), Tina Taylor (8.80)
and Karen Jorgenson (8.80).

“Shelly had a fall on beam, but
otherwise she had a great routine,”
said Yohman.

Sleith's fall occurred during her
Gainer layout, which is a back
ﬂip from one foot. _

The Lady Panthers then turned
their attention to the ﬂoor
exercises. The‘ Pitt squad is
normally very strong on ﬂoor,
but they came across several
problems. Yohman attributed
these mistakes to limited training
with the tricks this past week.
Brown, who received an 8.95,
over-rotated her double-back and
landed on her back out of bounds.
Venezia scored an 8.75 and Taylor
turned in an 8.9, both over-
rotating their double—backs. Lady

Panthers who turned in scores in.

excess of 9.0 were Wallish (9.1 S),
Butkovich (9.2) and Jorgenson
(9.45).

Bulls drop another close match

By Geoff Moskowitz
Staff Writer

Afterstartingtheirseason with
an impressive win against the
New England Blazers, the
Pittsburgh Bulls have lost three
straight, including Saturday’s
loss to the Baltimore Thunder
at the Civic Arena, 15-13.

The Bulls’ 1—3 record is no

-indication of how tough they

have played against the
formidable - six—team MILL
competition. In fact, statistically
the Bulls have players ranked
in the top three for goals and
assists and are ranked third for
scoring (11.0 per game) and
shooting percentage (67.6
percent).

R Brian N ikula continues to lead
the league with 12 goals, and is
second to Baltimore’s Ricky
Sowell in points per game.

Sowell, Saturday night’s MVP,

continues to set the league on
fire, averaging 5 points per
game. And with Saturday’s
performance, Sowell is
breathing down Nikula’s back
for goals scored. He has 10.

Sowell said he thought the
Bulls defense hurt themselves.
“They play almost ,too
aggressive. T 00 much stick
swinging. They don't take
advantage of their cross checks,
which is the biggest difference
between outdoors and
indoors.” _

Sowell’s four goals and ﬁve
disallowed goals for the Bulls
proved to be the difference in
the game. Four Bulls goals
were disallowed because of
crease violations, and one was
scored just after the whistle
blew for an infraction.
Otherwise the game was very
close, with the Bulls and

2 Thunder virtually trading goals

, W88

on alternating possessions.
Three power-play goals were

also a factor for the Thunder.

Bulls coach Dennis Wey said

that second shots on rebounds

also hurt the Bulls.

In order for the Bulls to make
the playoffs, they must win their
remaining four games,
according to Wey.

Notes: Attendance was
11,998; this was an increase of
almost 2,000 from the first home
game. Butch Marino had a hat
trick for the Bulls. Jim Beardmore
started his first game in goal but
replaced by Bruce
Donaldson midway through the
fourth quarter. Brian Nikula
recorded two goals and an assist.
The Bulls travel to New England
for their second meeting of the
season on Feb. 10. The Bulls
won the first game, 14-11. -The
Bulls return home March 3 for
a meeting with Philadelphia.

really improving and doing well.
He did a lot of good things,” said
Stottlemyer. “Same with Doug
Johnson. When you get that close,
you've got to give a little extra to
win. Sean needed to fire out [of
his bottom position] and score
one point. Doug needed a
takedown and had plenty of time

to get it.”

Stottlemyer said his young team
must learn to channel its extra
energy on the mat. “We all get
frustrated, but we’ve got to
transfer that onto the mat because
that’s where it counts.”

The season will not be getting
easier for the Panthers. Four of
the remaining six matches will
take place against teams ranked
nationally by the Amateur

Wrestling News. This includes
Penn State, ranked sixth, West
Virginia (17th), Clarion (19th) and
Edinboro (21st). West Virginia

defeated Bloornsburg Saturday-

night, 22-11.

The Lady Panthers brought
their stake of mishaps into their
final event; vaulting.
Lady Panther scorers were
Butkovich (9.3) and Sleith (9.2).

Butkovich, who scored a 9.25

parallel bars Pitt sent Wallish,
who scored a 9.15 and placed
ninth. On the balance beam Pitt

place), Venezia (9.25 and eighth
place) and Brown (8.85 and 12th
place). For the ﬂoor exercises
Pitt sent Jorgenson, who scored
a 9.55 and placed fourth.
