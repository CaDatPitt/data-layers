 Idrrell for President  A
_ J. Kent J arrell is the candidate this newspaper believes
‘ is best qualiﬁed for the ofﬁce of president of. Student Gov-
ernmerit Association. ~

The scope of his experience at the University is broad
'and..many- of the positions he has held serveto train for fu—-
ture’ executive leadership. _

As early ‘as his sophomore year, Jarrell, as one of. the

co-ordinators of the Assemblies Committee of Student Con-=
gress, performed in an exemplary manner. Last spring, he
was student ‘co-ordinator of Commencement, which brought
over 100 "other student aides under his leadership.
C This past summer, he was in ,virtual charge of Student
Government Association} during the vacation absence of ‘the
pres_ident. Also "during this tnirne,.he edited the small hand-
;;book, the Calendar, which required a thorough grounding in
all University events. ‘ s . —

It has been commented, that the primary function of
Student Government Association lies in’ tha..allocation of
funds. Jarrell, as treasurer. of SGA and chairman of the
Finance Committee, has been the man responsible for the

. implementation of. this, primary function.  ‘ .

A ' ‘;iBy Ind Amdur

The". television prégram “The Twentieth Cen-

‘ tury” ‘has consistently presented to its audience.

- described at the beginning as
~ egocentric, security-minded, con-

programs that are educational, provocative, and

series of . programs gientitled
“Generation Without a "Cause.
The first .week presented groups
of typical youth -at Rutgers and
Douglas Universities. They were

formist, and cautious. _
The ‘second "week presented
the story of a youth who was-
neither V security-minded, con-I
formist, nor cautious. His name is _.eter Knauss, a
senior political- science major at Rutgers Univer-
sity..,According to his friends, Peter"-—is;'not:Qgoing

 topco1lege'.onl,y in ‘oxrderfto receivegthe “ticket to

the magic world of middle. c__1asVs.conformity——-the
diploma.” ‘ C y ’ A ~‘ ' ‘_ V
He") is different. Peter, say his friends, sees
things that are ‘wrong in the _world and cares
enough aboutithem so that he may someday change

them._He refuses to be apart of a generation which

is afraid to accept causes or to:‘uphold’convictions.

Boys Describe Philosophies

In a'n—a_ttempt to portray why and how Peters

' is different,phe is shown in different situations and

described by different people. In one scene Pete is
speaking with two other boys. One of these boys

describes. the fundamental idiocy of man’s life. He _
speakssof the absurd condition of existence, and

describes a world with no absolutes, no reasons‘for
life. The _by-word that another boyfverbalizes is_

-the Socratic “Knowthyself.”

Both of these boys are searchers, but neither of
them hasvfound what he is searching" for. Peter,
too, is a searcher but he seems to have found some
answer to man’s “fundamentally absurd condition.”

Rather thanlconstant and egocentric introspec-

tion, Peter claims that helping others is part of the.

answer to man’s quest for self-realinzation. Through

the goal of ,“helping life wherever he ﬁnds i't”‘-

Peter can afﬁrmhisiown life in spite of its seem-
ing absurdity.' . ‘
'LigM'. Ligh'I' . . .'

_ He is also shown in one of his classrooms with
Professor Houston Peterson. Peterson is uttering
Goethe’s last-words .“light, light, and more light.”
Then he proceeds to quote the last line from
Spinoza’s Ethics, “But all-noble things aregas dif-
ﬁcult as they are rare.’—’ Peter Knauss seems to
have assimilated both of these quotations not to
write out on tests but to use in life.

Toward the end of the program Robert Frost is
_shown reading his famous poem- “The Road‘Not
Taken.” Peter thinks that if he cantake the road
less travelled by, this will indeed make “all the dif-
ference in his life.

The program portraying Peter Knauss was in-
spiring beéause Peter deﬁed the picture of the apa-
thetic, typical" American College student.’ He didn’t
have "a beard, nor did he look beat. In factrhe
looked and dressed like the typical college boy.
What he said and what others said about him
showed how very ‘different he was from his
archetype.

, Danger in Conformity « ‘ »
a Our. generation has been described by many
with adjectives which are not ﬂattering. We have
"been labelled very conformist, prudent, and not
too willing to change the world or even think about
it. If we are to assume the leadership of one of
the few democratic nations in existence, we dare
not be, we cannot be conformist and cautious.

Each of us-had a duty to break through the
herd, which is the noun mai-nlyused to character-
ize contemporary American society. According to
cartoonist Robert Osborn we should change our

national symbol to sheep. He states that .the eagle I

who soars and reaches alone is no longer repre-
sentative of the average Americanucitizen.
Our generation does have a cause if it will only
accept it’; Perhaps we can change the American
. symbol from a contented sheep back to a ruffled
eagle. A student like Peter Knauss cannot ac-
complish this immense task by himself.

With Coi1test’s_ Critic

Editor, The‘Pitt-News: .
On Monday, March 9, there
appeared in this column a" letter

‘from a student sarcastically crit-
icizing the “Ugly Man” contest I

at the University. -In effect, the
letter did not criticize the con-
test’as a whole, but rather its
being an “Ugly Man” contest.

_Although extremely sarcastic
in form,_ this letter was un-

doubtedly ﬁlled with sincerity .
~and emotion. It tended not only
‘to criticize the —-particular form

of fund—r'aisin'g, but also to cast »
' Phi‘

aspersions upon Alpha.

\

Omega, the organization which‘

sponsored it.

, .. As ‘alumni advisor to Alpha

Phi Omega, I feel it is my pre-
rogative to not only clarify these
impressions somewhat" for the

author of the letter, but also~fo1_j.

- the many students who may

have read it and formed opin-

ions as-a direct result. _ ‘
,Although a_ great_ deal" of what

the author of that letter said

appeared to me to be quite a

"bit of‘ jargon, I -‘believe t h a t

what the author was_ primar_ily
concerned ‘about was “poking
fun at human ugliness.” I. feel
that I_ am not able to help the

_ author change his values regard-
ing this at this point. -

It might, however,‘ interest
the author to know‘ the follow-
ing: V

1. The “Ugly Man” contest is
not solely a University of Pitts-

burgh enterprise; that‘ it is in,

fact, an annual or semi-annual
means of fund-raising at nearly
300 colleges and universities
throughout the nation. 
‘2. In most of these institutions
it is not strictly “Ugliest Man
on the Campus” contest, but also
an “Ugliest Faculty Member on
the Campus’-’ contest as well.

_ Man entrants in past years have
, been presidents, chancellors and

deans of some of the most out-

standing institutions of higher
education.

5. Of these prominent educa-
tors those who have been “win-
ners” give as much pride to the

-'\“Ugly Man” keys as they do

their Phi Beta Kappa Keys.

. Of course, these vital statistics
still .do not offer at good contrary.
argument to the points which
your cynical author so sarcastic-
ally expounded. C _, .

-A_ The author stated that he had
not only missedsout in partici-
pating in_such.,a th1_'i_lling cam-

spaign," but "that, he also imissed‘ v

an opportunity to perforrn a so-
cial ’ and humane service, and
also that he "did not have fore-

sight to« join a fraternity or-
group and “avail, himself’ of the.
“extreme joy of the pursuit of ‘

uglinessqon a high plane of in-
tellectual_ activity.” P’
Perhaps’ if the author had «not
missed out, on ‘such experiences
he would“‘never had been moti-

vated to write such a letter. It

would also, .in all probability,

render_ the ‘author -a service‘
which ,I am unable to do at this ’

point  namely, tp clarify and/
or qualify the hurnan. values
which “tolerate” such an enter-
prise as an “Ugly Man” contest.‘

I merely wonder at this point

.how the candidates in the con-

test, and the representative; or-
ganizations ‘ which nominated
them, feel about the author’s
ideas..I also wonder‘ if the au-
thor was really ‘under the im-
pression that candidates were
selected because of their “ugli-
nessi” , ,

‘Editor, The Pitt News:

I. would like .to ‘make .a few

comments 'on_’,,‘f"I‘he ..Treatment' of’.

  

_ gaining

Dr.\Lumer” by Ina Amdur. I be-
lieve her main.point was that
“any speaker‘ who comes to this
University or any other Uni-

versity deserves the respect of)’

his audience.”

I am in complete disagreement
with this view. A speaker does
not deserve respect .merely by
coming to talk at a University.
He deserves respectfor what he

is (or represents), what he has .

done, or what he intends t-o do.
Does Dr. Lumer deserve respect’
by this deﬁnition? _ _

Miss Amdur was correct in
stating that a university is sup-
posed to be a place of free in-
quiry and intellectual attain-
ment, but this does not mean

«that the adults who were against

having Dr. Lumer. were against
free inquiry. Rather they were

conscious of several points that b "

she seems ‘to have missed.
First, Dr.'Lumer’has had more
intellectual training than most

A of;his audience. In this advan-
tageous position, he 'can make"

points that would never be ac-
cepted by a group of his intel-
lectual peers. A
Second, at the present time
the Communist Party is in dis-
grace with most -American peo-
ple. Before the communists can
hope to proceed with their ulti-
mate aim (the violent overthrow

of our_ present system of gov-'

ernment, whether they admit‘ it

or not), they must elevate them- ‘
selves in the eyes of the people. ‘ '

Speaking. at universities and

.being graciously received by the

student bodies of these universi-
ties is a very efficient means of

as a member of our society, his

_work will be nearly completed. ,

Basketball lCan’t
"Be Wishy-Washy ,

By MURRAY cnass

 

 

 

Lou‘Prato ‘ _ - -
Sports Editor, The Daily "Collegian

- Penn State University _ ’ ,

Dear Lou,
I just ﬁnished reading your column of a few weeks back in which

‘I youisay some mighty harsh words about basketball at your ﬁne ‘insti-

tution. You call» Penn State basketball a “lost art;” “the quality of
basketball (there) . . . seems to have no more ﬁnesse and smooth-
ness than a donkey basketball game;” and then you say that “Penn

9 State basketball isn’t worth the ﬂoor it plays on.” .

- Lou, if you say all that about) your school’s basketball, how should
I feel about the caliber of basketball played here? ‘ g 7 A .

. True, Bob Timmons has had his quintets in two NCAA tourna-
mentsin the past three years (as long as I’ve been here) and has
compiled a record of 44-32 in the same period. But don’t forget that
we had All-American-Don Hennon playing on our side all that ‘time.
What d-id we have before, and what’ are we going to have in the
future? ‘ .

The answer to both questions is the.same: nothing. You say
., "bu have only one good ball player, Mark DuMars. But don’t,
forget--you have DuMars for two more seasons. Hennon is gone,
and there’s no one to take his place. K ”

- Let me just~point out a couple of statistics. The closest anyone

came to Hennon in scoring this past year was John Fridley. But "he

scored only '12 points a game. No one else averaged in double ﬁgures.)

Some people claim’ that without Hennonvthey team scoring. will be
spread out more and that the Panthers won’t be any worse off. ,

I ' Now that’s,plain silly. You don’t replace an All—Americ;an with a
bunch of mediocre ball players. Some of the fellows who played reg-
ularly this past season will be okay next year, but ‘they won’t be any
more than just okay. There'isn’t anyone who will be able to take up
the scoring slack, and don’t let anyone tell you that each man will
do his part. A , -

Timmons’ won’t, have anyone-coming up from~ the freshmen
team either. It’s hard to imagine any téam finishing with a 2-13-
markfbut that’s what our freshmen did. That in itself is -the tip-
oﬁ to the future of Pitt basketball. _ '
The frosh of 1957-58 lost only three of 15 games andthose same
players couldn’t do much for thevarsity. So how can we__expect a
team that wins two games to help? _ ’
Lou,‘you come to the conclusion that Penn State needs either more

wscholarslrips or a new coach, maybe both. Just between you and me,

Pitt’siproblem goes deeper than that. It starts in the athletic policy
toward basketball.‘To tell you the truth, I’m not too sure what the
policy is. And I don’t know many other people who do.

It’s not geared to big time basketball, such as is played at .
Kentucky, or at the ._two North Carolina schools, or what usedto
be-played at Duquesne. ‘We don’t have the recruiting program
or an Adolph Rupp for that type. J ' I

But don’t get the idea that basketball is meant to be small time

‘here, If it is, they’ve sure fooled ‘me with the schedules’ they are

playing. We_’re still playing some of the rea_l big"name schools.

You know where we are? Right in the wishy-washy middle, that’s
where. If we know what’s good for us, we better get out of that mid-
dle-——real quick-like. ’

One way to do that is decide whether they want Bob Tim-

I mons to be a basketball coach or a football coach. He’s been,
handling both these jobs for about six years and, _n9 "one, seems"
to mind. We’re a big university though. We should be able to
afford to pay two men for these two jobs. .

A I have nothing against Timmons. He’s a real nice guy and a good
backﬁeld coach. But I think that he is happy being just that.

Why should he want to coach basketball, too? Why should the athletic

.' department want him to? They know that when the key -recruiting

months in the Spring‘ come around, Timmons is busy with Spring

J,/football practice.

Then at the. tail end of the football season he has to leavethe
football team and begin basketball practice: It doesn’t make sense.

_ _We’ve had too many guys get away. Your’ future All-Amer_-
ican, DuMars, never should have been allowed to leave this area.
Nor should have Lee Patrone, of Steubenville. There are a number
of otherswho should"'e'nro‘ll at Pitt, too, but they haven’t and
they won’t, not as long ‘as we don’t go after them. _

» I_,have to get back to work on the paper, Lou," so I’ better write

“30.”: Just one last thing. If we \(Pitt) intend to pull ourselves up

from that wi_shy-washy middle, we better do somethingefast, before

* next season. Maybe I’ll even write a column about it. Well, keep try- '

ing, buddy. See you next football season.

will want to return to>Pitt. .‘?He’d
have two years of playing here,”
Mike said, “and only one wherever
he would go since he would have
to sit out a year.” - .

Michelosen had talked -with

Sharockman last Friday and had
intended to talk with him again
Saturday morning. “But I got
out t'o~the Student Union and he
wasn’t there,” the coach said.
Michelosen "further commented
that he 'didn’t think there is

Dr. Geise said that in cases
such as these the University does
not give any details. This, he said,
is in “fairness to the students.”
All players were soph_omores.

Sharockman was.the only one
of the quartet who received a "
letter in 1958. As one of three

quarterbacks he gained 164

2'Mat1neni W/in,. Team Places 4th 3

BY TED COLTON _

Friday the 13th caught up with
Rex Perry’s matmen as, they bat-
tled to a disappointing fourth
place in the Eastern Intercol-
legiate Wrestling tournament. The
Panthers were plagued with bad
luck throughout the tourney .but
still managed to place two in-
dividual champions.

Taking first place in the 130-
lb. class for the Blue and Gold
was sophomore ‘Larry Lauchle.‘
In the_167-lb. class Tom Alberts

_ took individual honors. Lauchle
had been undefeated in his first
ten vars’ y matches, and Alberts

had a 6-1-3‘ record.

Lehigh won the E.I.W.A. team I

championship with a total" of 64
,points followed by Penn State

(51), ;Corne11 (39), Pitt ,. (37),
A Syracuse (24,), and Army (23). I

J

    

Everything started’ out smooth-.
ly for the Panthers as they placed
ﬁve. of their eight men in the
quarter—ﬁnals. Paul Powell, Lau-.
chle, Sherm Moyer, Alex Skirpan
and_Alberts posted victories. Then
the Friday the ,‘ 13th jinx. took
over.

After Powell and Lauchle had
won their matches in the quar-
ter‘-ﬁnals, Moyer tried to make
it three in a row for the Panth-
ers. But after apparently pin-
ning Lester Austin of Syracuse,
Moyer went on to drop a 9-7
decision in the last minute. .

In_ the 157-115. class, Skirpan
took a commanding lead over‘
Syracuse’s Harry Pollak, but then
"separated, two ribs in making a
