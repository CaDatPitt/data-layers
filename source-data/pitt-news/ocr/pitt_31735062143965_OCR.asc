Owl Announces
Pic Deadline

For Seniors

November 17 has been set as
the deadline for Owl pictures of
seniors. Appoin‘tments for these
pictures .should be made imme-
diately. Seniors are asked to get
their Owl orders in now to avoid
the last minute rush.

“It "is essential that this dead-
line be met in order to get the

Owl out at the earliest possible
date,” stated the editor. “Every
senior will want his Owl as a col-
lege r-emembrance and the work
must be started early to insure a
good job and early publication.”

The sale of subscriptions to
undercla-ssmen will begin Novem-
ber 17 and con'tinue through No-
vember 30. Gimbel photo studios
will -be open for the following

two weeks for undergraduate.

made early at the Owl oﬁice. Ac-
cording to Miss Mos.s, last minute
appointments will mean long
waits at the stu-dio.

Cards for these appointments
will be issued’ at the Owl ofﬁce to
seniors until November 17 and
for undergraduates until Novem-
ber 30.

To- maintain uniformity, all un-
dergraduate wpmen must wear
sweaters. and. pearls and under-
graduate men, long ties and. jack-
efts. The senior women-’s pictures
will be taken in black velvet
drape and the senior men's in
tuxedos. The clothing for the sen-
iors. will 'be provided at the studio.

“The promptness and coopera-
tion of all seniors an-d undergrads
will guarantee the Owl’s success,”
Miss Moss said.

For the past 15 years, Miss Os-
borne has been traveling through-

out the country coun=se.ling college

girls, business groups, and club
women on the art of beauty.

'‘‘As the number of men .in this
country‘ decreased during the war,
so did the number of well-groom-
ed women,” ex:pl~ained Miss Os-
borne. “N-ow, with men returning
from service, the girls are primp~
ing once again and dressing up.

“A woman can wear extremely
casual clothes and yet look at-
tractive if she is beautifully
groomed,” she said. “Unfortunate-
ly, too many girls didn’t bother
about their grooming when there
was little prospect of a d-ate.”

“Charm,” she continued, “is
something that comes from inside.
To achieve it a woman must be
completely natural, pleasing to
others, and just -a little bit differ-
ent in her thinking and her man-
ner.”

’Miss Osborne will make ap-
pointments for small group con-
ferences after her arrival. These
conferences will be held in the fol-
lowing women’s fraternity houses
who have offered the use of their
houses for this purpose: Phi Sig-
m-a~S»igma, Delta Zeta, Theta Phi

Annual Thanksgiving Dance Back

The Turkey Trot is back! The
annual Thanksgiving dance, a war
casualty last year, will return to
the -Pitt Campus. Student Con-
gress will sponsor the dance to
take place Monday afternoon, No-
vember 19, in the Sdhenley ball
room.

Joey Sims and his orchestra
will provide music for dancing
from 3 to 6 o’clock. Admission to
the aﬁair will ‘be the nominal
price of 25 cents per person.

It is the hope of Student Con-
gress that students and their
friends will turn out for this “Tur-
key Trot.” If the dance is a suc-
cess, -others similar to it will be
arranged for throughout the school
year.

Herky Knell, president of the
student governing organization,
says, “We want everyone to at-
tend the dance. It is not a date

Joan and Mac will lead the
“Turkey Trot”

affair so anyone may come stag
if he wishes to. Come and have
some fun like you had at the
Howdy Hop.”

Lee Mclnerney, social c-hair-
man of Student Congress, adds,
“And too-. never -before have we
been able to dance t-o Joey Sims
orchestra music at such a rea-
sonable cost. Let’s all turn out
and support the Turkey Trot.”

Entertainment for the after-
non will center around skits pre-

sented by the various women’s
fraternities on campus.

Members of the Commons Room Council have called to the
attention of youredittor the-fact that many students are using
the Commons Room as a place for study. It is the desire of the
Council that such practice be refrained from, ‘as the Commons
Roomis not a study room, but a place where students may meet
their friends and gather around the tables for informal conver-
sations.” There are libraries on the ﬁfth, sixth, and seventh ﬂoors

VVi:th old activities being revived on campus and new ones
organized, it is natural that notice of the different meetings be
published in the Pitt News. However, due to the importance
and number of other larger articles which concern the student
body as a whole, it has become impossible to treat each notice
separately. Thus, to relieve the situation, the Pitt News has be-

Miss Emily Irvine’s Journalism 21 Class, in which announce-

Petition For Dismissal
Circulates University

A, petition»-asking for the dis-
missal of football coach Clark
S'h-aughnessy has been circulating
around the University for more
than a week.

The ‘petition, which now -has
more than 400 signatures, is a per-
sonal attack on Coach Shaugh-
nessy as well as a «criticism of the
de—emphasis of football at Pitt. If
2000 studvent-s~ sign the petition, it
will be presented to =C.h~ance1lor
Rufus H. Fitzgerald.

-Coach Shaughnessy branded the
petition. as, “sponsored by trouble-
makers who are enemies of the in-
stitution and -who are stimulated
by ulterior motives.” He said that
the signers of the petition are try-
ing to capitalize on the losses of
a live team. ‘The Pitt coach de-
fend-ed himself and the team by
stressing the facts that the team
has been badly hampered by in-
juries an-d that many of the
quarterbacks are freshmen with-
out much experience.

In 3 statement given to the
Pittsburgh Post Gazette one of the
players, who asked that his name
be withheld, said, “We held an in-
formal meeting and decided that
the petition was very unfair to
Coach Shaughnessy. We want the
public.to know that ‘we are 100
-per cent behind: our coach.”

The petition in part reads, “The

policy .of Pitt at this time seems
to be de-ampha-sis of football. It is
our opinion that good football has
its place in college life. We haven't
had goo-d football since Dr. Suth-
erland left -and especially since the
coming of Mr. Shaughnessy.”

The petition lists the following
four ‘complaints:

1. “He (Shaughnessy) has
never stressed the fundamentals
of football —- blocking, tackling,
conditioning.”

2. “In the Notre Dame game
three plays were run while Pitt
had only ten men on the ﬁeld.”

3. “He continually s-ubstituted,
ruining two 'Pitt scoring chances
by losing important yardage.”

4. “He doesn’t permit
quarterback to run the team.”

In regard to this prevailing sit-
uation, the editor of the Pitt News
has received the following‘ letter
irom a Pitt underclass-man.

To the Editor:

I think the average fair-minded
sports follower will hesitate be-
fore he condemns the policy pur-
sued by Clark Shaughnessy with
regard to the Panthers this year.
During a year when individual
blunders were mainly responsible
for losing games, some of the
student body seem willing to shift
the blame for these losses to Mr.

Shuugnessy whose methods have
heretofore never been questioned.

Mr. Shaugnessy came to Pitt
during a season when good ma-
terial was at a premium and, in
spite‘ of the terriﬁc handicap of-
fered by this wartime condition,
has been able to make a. fairly
presentable showing. This year
was actually the ﬁrst in which
promising players reported for
practice, and the school as well
as Coach Shaugnessy had every
reason to feel optimistic and con-
ﬁdent. Our ﬁrst tussle with a su-
perior Illinois team revealed many
defects in play, but one or two
bad breaks enabled the opposition
to roll up this impressive score.
Pitt displayed excellent form and

a powerful line when they trounc- A

ed W. Va. and Bucknell, holding
both teams scoreless. In contrast
with last year’s lopsided score
Pitt was able to hold a vastly
superior and highly-touted Notre
Dame team to twelve points
for the ﬁrst half in view of the
fact that both scores had been fa-
cilitated by sheer luck. A fumble
near the goal and a last-minute
pass over the goal are nearly per-
fect examples of sheer luck and
breaks. Since the beginning of
the season the team has been
plagued by fumbles, the majority
of which have proved. costly. Pitt
has almost completed the season
without any serious injuries; this,
I attribute to skillful handling by
its coach. Mr. Shaugnessy’s meth-
ods employed in the Notre Dame
game cannot be questioned. There
was much at stake in this game.
and a logical lay behind every
move eﬁected by the coach in
spite of penalties incurred, none
of which enabled the opposition
to score.

The Panther ball carrying corps
has set up touchdowns for the
opposition time and again by
failure to hold on to the ball. No
less than 19 fumbles have been
recorded against Pitt. Of the mis-
cuesj the Panthers have recovered
nine, ﬁve of them in the Mich.
State game where Pitt was top-
ped 13 to 7. These errors coupled
with an inability to properly de-
fend against passes have spelled
doom for the Pitt victory hopes
all season. '

Mr. Shaugnessy’s reply to the

charges leveled against him are
clear and to the point. I ask that
his record in view of the individ-
ual play performances be brought
into the light and carefully weigh-
ed before further action is taken.
Pitt is again coming into its own
after what might be termed lean

years. It has potential winners;

it has an aggressive experienced
coach whose past record as a
coach is above reproach. It has
an energetic, loyal student body
rallying to its colors. By person-
al application and more encour-
agement, Pitt can and will be-
come one of the nebulae of the

football world.

the Continental Air Forces Staff.

A-t Pitt, he majored in business
administration and was the stu-
lent director and drum major of
the band and chairman of the
Musicians Ball in 1940. A graduate
of ’42, he took the four year ROTC
course with the exception of the
senior. year camrp, and was sent
to Ofﬁcer ‘Training Sc-hool in
Miami Beach, Florida. ,

He completed his training in
September, 1942, -and was com-
missioned a second lieutenant in
the Air Corps Reserve. He went
overseas in January, 1943, and
.served in the North Afnican,
Sicilian, -and Italian campaigns.

Returning to the United States

Nietz Criticizes
New Techllique
In Text Books

In an article published in the
November 3 issue of School and
Society, a leading weekly profes-
sional education magazine, Dr.
John A. Nietz, professor of edu-
cation, criticized over specializa-
tion in current day text ‘book
writing methods. A

While emphasizing a change in
the method of specialization, Dr.
Nietz pointed out that the dangers
from specialization still exist.

Dr. Nietz said that writers of
-textbooks have become so s-pec-
ializedl in limited ﬁelds that the
-student, the object of all text-
books, has been forgotten. “We
have become so highly specialized
in textbook writing that we think
in terms of the subject ﬁeld, rath-
er than in terms of the boy or girl
for whom the book was written.”

In Dr. Nie-tz’s article, the third
of .a series -written by him for
School and Society, he pointed out
the change in the method of spec-
ialization which has developed in
recent years. Dr. Nietz presented
biographies of ﬁve textbook auth-
ors of the early nineteenth cen-
tury whose specialities were meth-
ods of writing rather than limited
ﬁelds. One of the authors -wrote
texts on as many as ten different
subject ﬁelds. However he was a
specialist in that he wrote only for
children. Dr. Nietz pointed out that
the present day textbook author
rarely writes in more than two
closely related ﬁelds.

Childhood Ambition

By Max Memmer
The Pitt Band’s new drum major is wavy haired Michael Plesher.
Mike was born and reared in a little town called East Monongahela.
Here he went to Monongahela High School where he took part in
many school activities, including Vice President of the Science Club,
High School reporter for the Daily Republican, Vice President of the
Latin Club, Advertising “Manager for the senior class play, member

of the Crusader’s Club, and the Hi-Y -Club.

His aim since childhood was to
become drum major of a big uni-
versity band and now it looks as
though that wish has been ful-
ﬁlled. He can master bugles and
all kinds of drums. After drum-
majoring in his junior year at
Monongahela High, Mike had to
give it up for a while in order to
become Athletic Treasurer in his
senior year. Then since the latter
part of 1943, Mike drum-majored
for the Sons of the American Le-
gion. He graduated from high
school in 1943 and came to Pitt
in the same year. ,

While going to Pitt, Mike had a
part time job with Combustion
Engineering up until this last
semester. Here at Pitt, Mike is
a member of the John Marshalls
and Pi Sigma Alpha, -both honor-
ary fraternities. He is also a cabi-
net member of the Y‘.M.C.A. and
belongs to the debating team. A
senior here at Pitt, Mike expects

majoring in political science and
economics. ‘Mike -did 'a grand job
of drum-majoring at the last four
home games. We hope to see more
of him in the future.

Visits Campus,

Relates Writing Experiences

By Jim

Pet-tican

“You don’t carry many prejudices into battle,” comments ex-
Sgt. Milton Lehman in summing up three years and two continents
worth of frontline reporting. Milt, who was graduated in ’39, is re-
membered here for his work on the Pitt News from 1937 until the

date of his graduation.

He was an English major and served as one

of the managing editors during those years.
Milt’s discharge last July 13 marked the end of an army career

during which he received wo-rld—e

wide recognition as a GI journal-
ist on the army newspaper
Stars And Stripes. Milt, who is
sharp-eyed, wirey, and youngish-
looking, joined the Stars and
Stripes vat Oran in December,
1942, soon after the initial land-
ings on the “Dark Continent.”
After sweating out a session as
managing editor, he grew tired of
desk -work and volunteered to
serve as a frontline correspondent.
In this capacity, he covered the
campaigns in Tunisia, Sicily, Italy,
and Southern France. It was dur-
ing t.his period that several of
Milt’s articles were reprinted in
the Saturday Evening Post and
other leading publications.

«Milt explains that a reporter’s
advantages over the average GI
may be summed up in the fact
that he is allowed more freed-om
of movement as he drifts from
place to -place picking up stories.
“Re-porters are not glamour boys
but they are -a lot luckier than the
average doug‘-hfoot,” he says. He
also feels that his overseas ex-
perience taught him a lot about
people getting along together.
“When things are bad enough,
people will forget themselves and
their prejudices and learn to co-

operate for their mutual advan-‘

tage, especially when their very
lives depend on it.”

According to Milt, the average
citizen.-soldier was quite talkative
and ea.sy to interview. “All you
had to do was ask his name and

he would immediately launch inio '

a discourse on his rank, serial
number, home town, and favorite
brand of beer.”

While overseas, Milt found many
ex-Pitt News staffers engaged in
newspaper work. Among them. was
Bill M-:E.l-Wain who is at present
handling :1 writing jo-b in Rome.
Milt ﬁnds Pitt changed and «is im-
pressed by the many discharge
but.t.on-wearers on han-d. “These
men have the beneﬁt of rich hu-
man experiences to add to their
text book training—-a combination
which should serve them in good
stead,” he states. ,

Milt is currently living in New
York. where he is doing work for
the Saturday Evening Post and
the New York Times Magazine.
His present plans call for a little
free—lancing around the country

as ‘he wants to “see what kind of ,

,

 

a deal» the average ex-Gi is get-
ting.” This should be an appropri-
ate assignment for Milt who dur-
ing the "war played a big part, to-
gether with other correspondents
in telling the ﬁghting man’s story
to the world.

Sergeant Flynn

Leaves Army,

Pitt This Week

Many of Pitt's faculty mem-
bers have recently dotted the uni-
form to return to the University.
This week brings news of a differ-
ent sort.

Master Sergeant John V. Flynn,
a member of the Military depart-
ment, will leave both the Army

Once discharged, the sergeant
plans to go into business in his
native city of Pliiladelphia.

Sgt. Flynn has been in the
Army sin-ce 1941 and was sta-
tioned in different training camps
th.rougho~u.t the South before he
came to Pitt in September, 19513.
While at the University he was in
charge of supply contracts for the
AS'T Medical unit, Co. “C”. This
assignment gave the sergeant
plen-ty of opportunity to bec-ome
acquainted with the University
staff. “Pitt”, Sgt. Flynn reports,
“is one of the friendliest schools
that I have ever seen. Everyone
at Pitt -cooperated with me -to the
fullest extent, and in a very cheer-
ful manner.”

‘Sgt. Flynn’s position will be
taken by Master Sergeant Samuel
S. Simon, a native of Wilkes-
Barre, Pa.

Sergeant Simon, who will as-
sume the duties of supply ser-
geant for Co. “C” an-d instructor
in the ROTC, entered the Army

pect of this subject. _

give their opinions.

There will be a meeting of

How about an int1:za—mural
sports program for vets‘? Would
anyone be interested in a lbasket-
ball league, the teams oil which
might be composed of veterans
from the respective schoeils. The
winner in this competition could
compete with the top team of the
Intra-Fraternity League ﬁnr some
sort of a championship. On‘ trnaybe
Doc -Carlson has some vets; on his
Pitt squad who won’t be able to
.-compete this year due to) a lack
of experience. These fellows: might
be organized as a Pitt What Five
to perform in some of tlme faster
basketball oi-rcles in the wicinity
and the venerable Doctor could
keep his speculative eye am them
"for future varsity use as they
gained competitive expnerience.
‘We don’t have a personal interest
in such activities because: we’ve
found that even a fast—nnoving
ping-pong ball is. apt to spin us
around, but if such an idiea ap-
peals. to any of -the vets, ﬁrnzd some
way to let us know ancﬁ». maybe
something could be done about it.

Are you a little lost vet who has
dropped his tray? Do you rnumble
as you fumble and situmble?
Brother, you are not alame. All
this is about the ‘Tuck Slhnps, so
1'epeating—Brothers, you are not
alone. Since some vets are in-
clined to be self-conscis, es-
pecially after dropping lemon

meringue all over a comely coed,
we are scribbling these few words
of consolation and advice.

(1) Be nonchalant at all times
while in the ‘Tuck Shop. However,
if you ﬁnd it diﬂicult to be non-
chalant and to breathe at the same
time, we highly advise doing the
latter.

(2) If conver'sa~tion is rlifﬁcult,
throwing a coke glass against the
wall establishes you as one of
“The Crowd.”

(3) Smile continuously. If you
can’t hear «well and you suspect
that your -conversation-mate is
telling you that his or her parents
were the victims of an axe mur-
der, smile knowingly and with
relish. The ‘Tuck Shop crowd just
can’t feel any other kind of emo-
tion. These three rules, it follow-
ed, will guarantec your success on
the Campus. - -

=l< =1‘ *

As it is our custom to point out
good deals ‘to ‘Pitt Ve-ts, we can’t
help reminding them that the
Turkey ‘Trot on November 19 is as
good a deal as could be tound. The
return of vets to the campus is
responsible in no small‘ way for
the revival of this traditional.
event. And ‘where else could you
dance to Joey Sims for ‘two bits.

IT’$ SIMPLY A MATTER OF TIME

The pendulum of pmoduction is swinging again for the
Bell System, as Western Electric, our manufacturing
division, reconverts for the all-out manufacture of the
thousand-and-one tliings we need to give you the Bell
System’s true standards of service once more.

During 1946, for itmiance, it is planned to add 2,100,000
miles of Long Distanme telephone circuits to the System.
That’s more than Ilere were in Great Britain and
France combined, before the war, and it means that the
pressure on our lines will ease up.

Today, of course, the thousands of calls of returning
veterans are actually giving us more rush-time peaks
than we had last yearn. So it’s more important than ever
to limit your call to five minutes when the operator must
ask you to do so. A service man’s call to his home may

be waiting.

Clark Shaughnessy’s Pitt eleven who have found the 1945 grid path rough and rugged, encounter another stumbling block in Indiana Univ.,‘ this Satur-
day aitternoon. Coach “Bo” McMil1in’s squad of “Fightin’ Hoosiers” were forgotten in all the pre—season Western Conference Ititle talk but have developed
as a winner. At the present the Hoosiers hold one of the inside lanes in the chase for the “Big Nine ” crown.

‘Nith the return of 14 lettermen, ﬁve of them being two year veterans and eight members of the 1944 reserve squad, McMilli11 was able to initiate the sea-
son with a better outlook than last season. The last edition of the Hoosiers was able to cop seven battles while dropping three and placed ﬁfth in the Confer-

ence standings with four up and three down.

Leading the parade of third year men is All-American Pete Pihos, a combination fullback-end who returned to the Indiana team after a term with the

Armed Forces. Pihos, who weighs¢

a bruising 210 pounds has formed
the bulk of the driving power in
the visitor’s backﬁelcl. after hav-
ing been converted from end.
With the moving of Pihos into
the tailback slot, John Cannady,
who had been groomed as a line-
bucker, was forced out of a job,
and the Indiana brain-charge
tested him in the center spot from
where he has started in all the
Hoosier grid tilts this season.
Four other third-year men will
start in the line against the Jun-
gle-‘Cats. They are Captain Bofb
Ravensburg, an 1-80-pound end
from Bellevue, Ky., who is being
touted for future All—American
honors; Frank Ciolli, a stocky
built guard who is only 5.7 and
tips the scales at 180; Russell Deal,
demon left tackle, hailing from
Bicknell, Ind., and weighing 19-5
pounds; Howard Brown, a guard

from Dayton, Ohio, who is a 200-
pounder and a vicious tackler;
and Joe Sowinski, regular left
guard who learned his fundamen-
tals at Roosevelt High in East
Chicago, Ind. Tackle J. Goldsberry
and end Ted Kluzewski complete
the line defense.

Combined with Pihos’ plunging
power in the Indiana backﬁeld
are the triple-threat antics of “Gal-
lopin’ George” Taliaferro, an 185-
pound freshman sensation from
Gary, Indiana, Speedster Tal-
liaferro has been punching holes
in his opponents’ lines with a
4.9 per try average and a grand
overall total of 468 net yardage
gained in his team’s first six starts.
Ben Raimondi and Sophomore
Mel Groomes round out the
Hoosier ‘backfield at quarter and
right half respectively.

If there was an upset ever in sight at Pitt stadium it looked as
though last Saturday was the day. The Panthers have played hard
all year. In every defeat Pitt fought until the clock ran out and on
Saturday it looked as if all their hard work might pay off. The Ohio
State Buckeyes came to Pittsburgh thinking the Panthers would be at

push-over, but for three and one-half quarters they found to the con-
trary. The Pitt boys really fought hard on that rain soaked ﬁeld and

had they gotten a few breaks, may‘?

be they would have one. We can
consider that 14 to 0 s.core a moral
victory but don't count that
lShaug-hnessy aggregation short

from here on in. .

A Quick Glance i

Upon all indications the Pan-
thers came out of the Saturday
tussel with no injuries, therefore
they will be in top shape for the
Hoosiers. The Indiana scouts n
doubt went back with the report
to beware of J immy Joe Robinson,
the ﬂeet footed Pitt back and the
punting of Mickey Temenoff which
was -more than satisfying. Clough-
erty, a recent member to the
squad, deserves great -credit for
his ba-cking up the line and sub-
bing in the center spot. Lets keep
up the good work fellows.
Quick Kicking .

A question discussed at the
-Monday Luncheon was the use of
the quick kick. In both college
and piro-fessional ball this quick
kick is very seldom used. On
‘Saturday in College Park, Mary-
land ‘the University of Mary-

lan-dt quick kicked against VMI
and the results very good. The
kick went from the Maryland 20
and rolled to the VMI 20. Mr.
Shaughnessy analyzed this play
thus: If a team has a good offense
why waste those first two downs
on a quick kick. Now if the de-
fense is- good and the offense poor
the quick ksick might be of some

i, help.

The Shag Incident

Th-e petition asking the ousting
of Clark Shaughnessy from the
ranks of the Pitt coaching job
has swept the country. If there is
one person behind it or a faction
of students it doesn’t matter. It
just won’t carry any weight. For
the material at hand the coaches
seem to be doing all right. Look
at that Ohio «State game on Sat-
urday, what more can you ask of
a coach. The boys give out all they
can but they haven’t enough to
beat a team stocked with man-
power and stars. The Pitt Alumni
can help a lot to get us some man-
power and stars.

Holding down the brunt of the line duties is
McManus, who is ably assisted by such backs and ends as Bill Boyd, Luke, Goodworth, Hein, and Connally.
5 Following up the ‘Phi Kapp’s is

the veteran PiKA team. The only
mar on their record is a 12-12 tie
with the Phi Delt fraternity. With
such men as Gallagher, I/Vood,
Lambert, and Bob Dui-ckey back
from last year; the PiKA’s are able
to ‘field a veteran ball ball club.
In their tie with the Phi Delt’s,
they showed a lot of ﬁght by com-
ing from behind to tie the score
twice. After the Phi Delt’s took a
6-0, lead‘ on Bill Drew’s touchdown
run, Jackie Wood returned the
kickoff for a PiKA score. Again in
the ﬁnal quarter with the PiKA‘s
behind 12-6, John Gallagher snug-
ged’ a pass from Lambert to sew
up a tie for the two teams. The
Phi Delt’s also spoiled a perfect
record in this tie game. They had
previously defeated the Pi Lam's
26-8.

On the tail of these undefeated
teams are the Phi Ep’s and SAE s,
each with one victory and one de-
feat. Phi Epsilon Pi, defending
champions, started very impres-
sively with an 18-0' victory over
the Delt’s, but lost the following
week to the strong Phi Kappa
team. The only holdover for the
Phil E‘p’s is Irv Simon. The SAE’.s
have defeated Sigma Chi 12-6 and
lost to the Phi Ka»p—p’s 37-25 in
their two games played.

to Pitt, he found‘ it was just as
easy to run with a ball in his
hands as long as no one was there
to stop him. That touchdown he
made in the Notre Dame game
proves his point "very well.

.Hitler’s threat to give Japan
his “most secret vengeance weap-
on" caused the United States to
intensify the perfection of the
atomic bomb and to hasten its
use, reports Major Donald Keyhoe,
in the November issue of True,
The Man’s Magazine.

Jap scientists had worked on
the atomic bomb research in Ger-
many with Nazi t-echnicians,
knowing that the perfection of it
was the prize for which warring
nations had been desperately
striving. “These scientists could
have reached Japan -by U—boat,
taking with them heavy water,
uranium, and plans for their al-
most completed bomb. It was not
likely, but it was possible,” con-
tinues Keyhoe.

There was evidence that the
Japs were as far advanced on
this research as Germany and that
they might have had the Nazis’
secret formula which had pro-
duced an atomic bomb for testing
purposes. At this same time, an
authentic report of a weirdly dev-
astated area in the heart of a
German forest proved that the
Germans ha-d brought the atom
bomb to a testing stage.
