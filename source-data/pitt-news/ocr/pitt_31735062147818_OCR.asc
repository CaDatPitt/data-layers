 «close''' of the game, Kopf threw a
 --pretty ﬁeld goal to put his team

; with one that tied it up, but Pitt

 as a defeat for Pitt by two points.

He was caging hem with beautiful
consi.stency while Cecil Conn did not
tighten up until the later stages of
the game. Pitt led at half time,

mainly through Leven-son’s efforts,
although they made but one field-

goal‘ inthis period. Levenson miss-
ed several easy chances from the
ﬁeld, spoiling Pitt-’s chances of tak-
ing a more commanding lead.

In the second half the play be-
came fast and furious‘, with Jordan
ﬁnding tire basket “with, some sensa-

tional shots. Neither team was able‘

to draw away from the other, how-

. ALL WORK AND NO PLAY

 

There seems to -be such an excess
of men who appear to be just of no
earthly value-—rotten to the core--
bad' stee‘l—-irregular we-ave--second
quality. To me, part ofthe incentive’
in “carrying on” is in the belief that
that useless, stagnant material can
be melted, segregated or disintegrat-
ed, and remolded or reassembled in-
to active, vital, constructi'vely ener-
getic substance. .. ..

Calories make heat. AVbowl of
oatmeal contains 200 calories; an av-
erage helping of griddle cakes con-
tains 500 calories; half a cantaloupe
100 calories; a plate of lettuce con-
tains no calories, perhaps 5 or 10.
That does not mean‘ that four bowls
of oatmeal, making a ‘total of 800

9 calories will furnish as nourishing

a diet as one bowl of oatmeal, one
helping‘ of griddle cakes, half a
canteloupe, and some lettuce, also
totaling -about . 800 calories. The
number of calories are equal; there-
fore, the heat derived from them,
which is power, is equal. But, the
best results are obtained when these‘
calories, heat, energy power are di-
rected in the proper c_han,n:e‘i~s.._ ,
Let 115 apply ourtheory. Suppose
that two hours of work produce 100’
units of brain reserve, one-‘half hour
of study produces 100. units, and one.-
quarter hour. of ‘class ,work: of six
hours of play produce likewise-. f,.All
of * them produce equal’ power. -But,
could the power from one be directed
in the some channels as the power.
from another? , " -
Oatmeal is highly nutritious for
the body. Work is highly nutritious
for the brain." But,” all oatmeal, or
311 Work. would be detrimental rather
than advantageous,’ just as all candy
or all play would resultgin the same
-manner. . V A .-

ON CULTURE

e

 

The college president ‘who described
the modern university as little more
than 3: country club indicated a con-
d1tion that is only -too true. F'or
what interests the -general student
more than country club pursuits: ath-
letics, activities, fraternities, etc.?
The minimum of attention is, devoted
I59 3<5h0131‘S‘hiD.-.,’. The aim is to. secure
marks rather than culture. Assign-L

GRAND THEATER

t

An extraordinary treat is in store
f‘orvlovers_ of good motion pictures at
the Million Dollar Grand, Pittsburgh,
all next week, starting Monday morn-
ing, Februaryj20, when Wesley Barry,
with not a missing,” comes in Mar-
shall l\_leilan’s remarkable adaptation;
of Booth Tarki~ngton’s famous stories
and play, “Penrod.” The picture is
an "eight reel First National produc-
tion, which means eight reelsx of the
greatest cinema entertainment. There.
isn’t a dull moment from the time
Penrod, iriimitably acted by ’Wesley,
plots with his gang to “bring the
unfeeling parents to time,” until the
boys all become heroes by capturing
the bandits whdrdbbed the bank. It
is a fun photoplay of unsurpassed
comedy, thrill, originality and charm.

Barry was selected by Mr. Tark-
ington himself out of. all the young
actors of filmdom as the ideal Penrod,
and that Tarkington selected aright is
attested by the tremendous amount
of praise now being accorded Barry’s
work. For'Wesley, has caught the
spirit of the boy just as the author
himself co—nce_ived him,"in all his irre-
sponsible mischief, graft, jealous-ies,
‘banter, rivalries, and boyhood appeal.
In fact Barry and the Penrod char-

‘acter seem to parallel one another

as the universal boy. , So.that_ there
would be no mistake in achieving a
super-special, Mr. Neilan gathered
together one of the greatest casts in
history, and he seems to have cor-
raled -all of the famous child actors
of the screen. Tully Marshall -has
the role of Mr. Schoﬁeld, Penrod’s
‘Claire McDowell that
of Mrs. Schoﬁeld. Marjorie Daw is
his elder sister, and John Hgarron her
sweatheart. K F.rederich —( Sunshine

Horton is the girl for whom Penrod
pines, and Gordon .Gr:.iffith, who play-
ed with Mary Pickford in f‘Dol1yanna”
and “Little I Lord Fa-unrtelroy,” is
Penrod’s. pal./ Baby Peggy ‘Morrison
of the Century Comedies has the role

of the tot whom Penrod,‘ much to his -

disgust, is compelled to dance with,

Beginning with the kidsdodf the

pices of the University of Pittsburgh,
the State Board of‘Health, and‘ the
United States Public Health Service.
Dr. S. R. Haythorn, of the Faculty of
the School of Medicine of the Univer-
sity, is directorof the Pittsburgh In-
stitute. The committee in charge,
appointed by Dr. Haythorn, is as fol-
lows: Dr. Mary Riggs Noble of Har-
risburg, Pa. ;. Miss‘ Elizabeth Cannon,
director of Public Health Nursing, -of
the University; J. Steele Gow, assist-

In the fall of 1920 there was held
in Washington an “Institute on Vene-
real-Disease Control and Social Hy-
giene.” More than 600 persons from
all sections of the country attended
the short -intensive courses which
were provided in the sociological,
legal, psychological and educational,
as well as the medical aspects of this
problem. Only within comparatively
recent times has much attention been
devoted to the venereal fdiseases.
Now extremely rapid developments
are taking place." On that‘, account
the opportunityto come into personal
Contact with-/the leaders throughout
the entire. ﬁeld was much appreciated
and gave new. impetus and direction
to work then under way, ‘ -.

Rapid progress in the ﬁeld of pub-
lic health has not, however, been con-
ﬁned to the control of the venereal
diseases. In child hygiene, industrial
hygiene, the control of general com-
municable diseases, nutritional dis-
eases, sanitary engineering; and
other ﬁelds similar‘ developments are

V occurring.

With such a rapid advance the ed-,-
ucational facilities for the training of
workers have not kept pace. The re-
sult is that many persons who are
employed in one capacity or another
in public health keenly feel the need
for information concerning the re-
sults of the most recent scientiﬁc re-
search and experience and for train-
ing in special subjects whose rela-
tion to their speciﬁc problem -has
only recently been understood. They
desire’ to come intopersonal contact
with those -who are recognized as‘--au-I
thorities in public health work.

Public health_ today is not merely
the interest of sanitarians and bac-
teriologists. As; the ﬁeld has extend-
ed the number of groups of those in-
terested in various phases of the

’co~ed style Stetson tailored shoes.

work- has grown. Sociologists, psy-
chologists, statisticians, educators,
social workers and physicians as well
as professional public-health Workers,
. are now concerned with the problems
of public health and are ableto aid,
in; its solution. Onthe‘ other‘ hand,
public-health workers _ can make their
work thoroughly effective only if
‘their training in medical "subjects is
supplementedby a knowledge of sta-
tistics, sociology, psychology and ed-
ucation. '  V .

It is for the purpose ‘of meeting
these various needs that health insti-
tutes have been organized. As one-
week schools theyghave many obvious.
limitations. They will, however, bring
health officers, private practitioners,
nurses,'\educators, heads of institu-
tions,‘ social workers and others con-
cerned . into closer ‘touch with the
newer aspects of public-health work.
They will show the importance of
such thorough training as. is now
available at the best schools of pub-
lic health and stimulate attendance
at these schools. They will provide
an invaluable opportunity for public-
health workers to meet leading spe-
cialists in the various ﬁelds. Thus
they will make public-health work in
the various communities more effec-
tive and the continued progress of
the public-health movement more
sure.

The Institute at Pittsburgh willhe
c,0n.ﬁned to courses on "venereal dis-
eases -and allied’ -problems and to. in-
dustrial hygiene. . At all other Insti-
tutes, except at Chicago, the courses
will include tuberculosis, child hy--,
giene, nutrition in health and disease,
the management of clinics and health
centers, the general communicable
‘diseases, the non-communicable dis-
eases, industrial hygiene, sanitary en-
gineering, administrative problems,
mental hygiene, medical social work,
protective social work and the delin-
quent... . v -

‘At approximately eight of the In-

WHAT IF THE MEIIIIIS’

WISHES WERE HHANTEH!

The office of the School of Medicine
has ogmplained that the students of
the School of Dentistry are in the habit
of making slides on the steps and
walks leading to and from the School
of Medicine‘. Such action causes
‘many of the medical students to hope
that the dental students responsidle
for the icy slides will some day reap‘
the fruit of their planting, whereupon
the med: will have the pleasure of
kindly extending surgical treatment
to the dents. Some of the medical
students would call attention of the
responsible dents to the dissecting
laboratory on the third ﬂoor of the
School of Medicine.
