UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

t’s There.  ,

... If You Wantlt .. .

by DON MARBURY
Staff Feature Editor

Last night another happening took
place. .

The Concerned Students and Faculty
..,held a teach - in in the Social Sciences
"Building to discuss the problems that con-

cern you. There are some students on this

campus who have really weird thoughts.

0

-~ ing to the-Social _Sciences building.

  

They are under this impression that
they are not really being educatedat this
University.

They feel that they are only being pro-
cessed; 'that the real purpose of going to a
University is really being lost somewhere
along the process of their four years atten-
dance. These students and faculty mem-
bers hold a view that since they do attend
the University that they should have some
say in the way it is run.

Everyone cringes at the words. rebel-
lion. and change. Their thoughts immedi-
ately turn to the-campuses of Berkeley
and Columbia. A

Radicals are called troublemakers. in-
grates. and sensationalists. Many students
sat home last night. rationalizing their con-
sciences with thoughts like: "the Univer-
sity isn't hurting me.“

“I’ll get a good job when! graduate.
Why should I get involved and risk every-
thing?” The students who participated last
night are only radical in the sense that
they are concerned.

They recognize the fact that there is
something radically the matter in the way
their education is being run. They see that
college life is a lot more than panty raids.
Ra-Ra-Ra Sis Boom Ba. and fraternity
beer parties.

The administration. as usual. tried to

;§j?p1ay' confrontation politics with the par-
/' ticipants in the teach-in. by forcing them

to move from the Common Facilities build-

   
 

Where the teach-in took place could-
n’t have been of any serious importance
to the administration, but they have this
hang-up that when something disrupts the
apple-pie order of things, they have to

quibble about something, even if they ’

can't do anything about the overall dis-
ruption. As Josh.Chasen said, “The ad-
ministration simply can't distinguish be-
tween a non-violent significant demonstra-
tion, and a violent upsurping. ,

The teach-in was very well organized.
The participants were broken up into sec-
tions. discussing different topics like:
“Censorship and Obscenity." “Trustees.
“The New Left." ‘ Behavior and Control
in Society." and "The Free University.’
The students and faculty members simply
talked to each other.‘They discussed the
things that bothered them about the Uni-
versity. what they thought should be done
about them.‘ and why someof these things
existed in the first place.

It was brought out in the discussion on
Trustees that their only real role con-

cerning the University was to provide ed-

ucational resources. and not to act as the
parents or guardians of the students. The
students were very concerned with the re-
luctance of the trustees to meet in an open
discussion with them. The trustees gave no

reason why they would not meet with the i

students in an open discussion. but just
gave a flat no.

The discussion on the free university
was one of the largest sections.

. In it the students were examining such
issues as our lecture system. the grading
system. the attitude of students in general.’
and the role of the faculty in the Univer-
sity community. That the University is
continuing to impose archaic rules on the

students.  Q   . 

.s.,...

There was indeed a happening last
night. People were deciding that they
wanted to participate actively in their own .
education instead of being passively pro-
cessed like machines being produced in a
huge complex factory. A

  Fleming Bill   
    May ‘Fade-Away’ 3

by PAUL STOLLER
Editor, The Pitt News

HARRISBURG — Student represen-
tatives of eight Pennsylvania colleges
and universities met here yesterday
with the Democratic leaders of the
State House of Representatives.

The meeting was convened by
Speakerof the House Herbert Fine-
man (D.-Philadelphal in order to ob-
tain some feedback from students con-

cerning the Fleming bill and major‘

campus problems. House Majority
Leader K. Leroy Irvis was also in at-
tendance. “

After some 90 minutes of debate,
the entire group reached the concen-
sus that it would be wise for Pennsyl-
vania colleges and universities to in-
vite legislators to campuses for infor-
mal discussion concerning student
problems.

All parties agreed that the funda-
mental problem ‘in the campus-legis-
lator relationship was one of communi-

cation. The communication; , it. was
-said. is so bad that...myths-concerning:

the House to initiate new legislation
that could replace the Fleming bill.

House leaders said that a genera1~
trespass law has been drafted and will '
be introduced in the House. It is hoped, ~
said a reliable source, that the House
will pass the trespass law, and the
Fleming bill will die in committee.

by ANN SHIREY
Retiring Business Manager

For me to "describe some of the
responsibilities and consequences
of being business manager of The
Pitt News for the past year would
take many, many pages. It would
involve blood, sweat and tears or

e at least remembrances of that. It
would probably shed a very dif-
ferent light on the task that I have
done or any other staff member

. has done than you now think is

done. But you’re probably not
really interested in these “secrets
of the trade.”

But I will tell you about the
past year as I perceive it in the
job that The Pitt News has per-
formed and what I gained from
the experience.

For someone to suddenly jump
or be thrown into a position of re-
sponsibility is at best frightening
and nerve-shaking.

Suddenly you are making de-
cisions about money and supplies
and personnel and what advertis-
ing to accept or reject or edit.
And you are dealing with the
University on a much closer, in-
timate level than the ordinary stu-
dent.

Youfsoon learn to wait two
months for supplies that are need-
ed quickly. to expect confusion
when University accounts pay ad-

ANN SHIREY

vertising bills and the University
gives you a monthly statement of
yourfinancial status. You really
learn about red tape and bureau-
cracy. And most important of all
you learn patience——an amount so
surprising because you never
thought you had so much.

But patience is only a preser-
vation techniq‘ue—you learn it or
else you can't survive in the Uni-
versity. You find out what real
frustration and anxiety are — not
the common student kind over
grades, but the kind that comes
from a real business situation.

What do you do when there are
five people waiting in the office
to talk to you about classified ads

' and errors on statements and an-

nouncements that have to go in
Monday’s paper (even though you
you are on the business staff) and
the phone is ringing and you’re
sure it’s about the error in your
bill from the printing company?
Which do you take care of first,
what do you say togthe advertiser
that’s upset and irate because you
misspelled “the” in his ad or left
out an interview date, or got the
time wrong for his event?

But having to deal with these
kinds of problems have made me
aware of just what is expected
from_ a service organization or
business concern.

It‘s made me more accurate in
judging the relative importance
of tasks and priorities. I‘ve learn-

ed to deal with people like I'll ‘

have to when I graduate and be-

_ gin my own career in business.

Basically, the whole experience
has made me more of a person
than astudent. I look forward to
the time when I can use the prac-
tical knowledge and skills that
I've gained f'rom this past year.

And part of this knowledge has
come through making mistakes.
I’m only human too and I have
made mistakes. Fortunately,,I

don’t think any of them will have '

long range bad effects on The
Pitt News or the staff.

Probably the worst mistake I
made was trying to initiate too
many changes with too little time
to spend on each to make sure
they were going to work and work
smoothly and without the neces-
sary staff to handle the changes.
But being short-staffed is a com-
mon occurrence and expected and
anticipated.

But what has The Pitt News
done this year? A lot. It's inform-
ed you about the state legislative
elections. It's tried to keep you
informed on the parking issue and

—the traffic condition. It's brought

to‘ light many problems of the
University —. the foremost being
the Fleming issue and his‘ status
as a trustee. . ‘

It’s angered and aroused many
of you-you’ve written letters; it’s
caused a lot of disillusionment in
others — you no longer read The
Pitt News with the trust of faith
you once read-it with. And should-
n’t this be the task of a college

_ newspaper——to keep you informed,

to enlighten you or make you feel
something, anything, even anger?
But I’m getting into theeditorial
side of the paper which just isn't
my. thing.

What has the business side of

   

The Pitt News done? Probably
‘not much that you can see. But it
has increased the availability of
classified ads — they run three
times a week instead of twice a
week as last year.

The layout of the ads is differ-
ent from last year and this allows
you a better. easier reading of the
paper.

It also lets you see more of the
copy and news and the ads. Your
parents, as subscribers, appreci-
ate the new mailing techniques

used, but there’s still a delayﬁ
which exists. But I tried to ’im-'

prove that, too. I can think of
many other changes and improve-
ments, none of which you can see
or appreciate. .

But perhaps you have gained a
small measure of appreciation
from reading this. Perhaps you
can understand a little better
what the paper is — your paper.
supported by you. written for you
and in some instances by you.
Perhaps you know a little more
about a fraction of the efforts that
go into producing your paper.
And maybe you have some ideas
or thoughts about what The Pitt
News is and should be.

Share them with those that are

working for the paper. with those?’

that really care and are definite-
ly prejudiced in your favor.

a Lower QPA

Sought For

SG Officers

by DAVE KUHNS
Staff News Writer

In Student Government (SG) act-ion
Wednesday. the Senate received and then
voted to reject the nomination of Mike
Fabricant for the position of chairman of
the Liberal Arts Cabinet. after a 20 min-
ute presentation by incumbent chairman
Joe Kociubes on the purpose and achieve-
ments of the Liberal Arts Cabinet.

An amendment to the constitution con-
cerning the establishment of a University
Judiciary System was introduced. The
amendment would establish an all encom-

' passing student court to deal with viola-

tions of the University regulatons by stu-
dents. Action will be taken on the amend-
ment at the next SG meeting.

In other Senate action. a bill requiring

_ the ‘president to appoint a committee to

_\‘evaluate the role and structure of the pre-

sent SG and make recommendations for
its restructuring was passed. .

In a future meeting of the SG Senate,
a constitutional amendment introduced to-
night concerning the lowering of the QPA

requirement for SG officers and senators '

will be voted upon.

The measure calls for the establish-
ment of a minimum cumulative QPA of

.I2.25 or a 2.50 for the term preceding the '

election of senators. In addition. the re-
quirement for presidential candidates was
lowered to a 2.50 cumulative or a 2.75 for
the term immediately preceding his elec-
tion.

’ As its next order of business. the Sen-
ate passed a resolution endorsing the Uni-

‘ versity baseball team in their efforts to

raise funds to enable them to attend the

A Florida Invitational Baseball Tournament.

According to Senator Louis Briskman,
the resolution was occasioned because “the
University has taken away _the baseball
team’s only means of raising money — a
raffle. It’s up toithe students, as the SG

* Senate confirmed tonight, to accept re-
sponsibility which the University has

Josh Chosen

A   That Bushy-Haired ‘Fellow’

by MIKE EDELSTEIN
Staff Feature Writer

The lobby of the Common, Facilities
building was packed with studentsftheir
attention directed toward the little- man
with bushy. red hair and mustache. He is
J osh' Chasen. "

When Josh talks. people listen. It‘s not
that his voice is commanding and it's not
that his short. stocky figure is anything but
imposing. But every word that Josh_in-
tones. seems to radiate from his entire be-
ing. It almost becomes a question of
whether Josh acquires following despite
his ideas. or because of them.

The scene in the lobby by '2 a.m. this
morning revealed a large number of stu-
dents remaining to hear the injunction that
would force them to leave the premises. It
was at this point that the Hobart College
(Geneva. N. J.) graduate gave his opinion
of the way things were goin_g.

When the students waited for the in-
junction Wednesday morning, Josh sur-
veyed the scene from his seat on the floor.

j'We‘ve demonstrated an unbelievable
amount of reasonableness which the ad-
ministration has not shown." he said.

"Because we set this thing up in the
Common Facilities building.-it is inextri-

cably enterwined with the fast. We‘ are
being reasonable here — the administration
made their own problem by conceiving us
as a menace to them." he said Wednesday
morning. “And they made a problem with

i the Pennsylvania legislature."

Josh doesn’t pretend to speak for the
student body, admitting, “I reflect my
own views.” He also doesn’t consider him-
self the leader of the Concerned Student's
movement. Said Josh, “There is'no leader.
The beauty of this group’ is that decisions
can be made in the form- of open’demo-
cracy.’i

Asked whether he had cleared the use '

of the Common Facilities building for the
fast and "free university." Josh admonish-
ed. “You shouldn't have to apply for per-
mission to have your own classes. We only

~ used vacant rooms and didn't disturb class-

es. The administration is unbelievably un-

reasonable — they've created their own.

mess."

Noting that the fast had not been dis-
cussed with the administration. Josh de-
clared.‘ “My friends are more important
than the administration. We talked it out
among a group of us students and faculty.

We thought it was a good idea. I don't like

this control from above. We're not kid-
dies anymore."

Lee Did It In A ‘Versatile’ Way
