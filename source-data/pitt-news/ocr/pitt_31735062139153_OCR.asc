GLUB’S PROSPECTS BRIGHT

The friends and members of the
Cosmopolitan Club will be pleased to
know that when they return next fall
they will ﬁnd the club associated with
the world movement known as the
Conda-Fraetres in Europe. There is
no reason why the club should not
keep pace with the onward march of
progress with our University. Both
the secretary of t'he University and
the dean of the -college were present
at a large gathering of the last social.
Both of them expressed their appre-
ciation of the results achieved by the
club.

Next year some amendments will be
made in the constitution whereby a
larger number of men will ‘be eligible

last Friday morning. Some of the
greatest orators of the country were
present and made strong appeals in
behalf of their favorite candida-tes. A
great throng of students clamored for
admission to the convention hall, but
admission was denied them. "Even
representatives of the Weekly were
held up until they produced their cre-
dentials.

J. G. Quick acted as chairman of
the convention, and he had his hands

his gavel (a yard stick) were these
outbreaks checked by -the chairman.

BUSY SUMMER FOR PITT

School Will Be Well Attended During
the Hot Months.

 

Dean Fetterman is receiving many

inquiries concerning the summer
courses offered in the College.

T'hese inquiries are coming from
many neighboring states as well as
from Pennsylvania and the prospects
for a‘good term’s work are very
bright. The University has set apart
a certain sum of money to be used in
securing men_ of wide repute to act as
lecturers during the summer. Deans
Fsetterman and Chambers have been
appointed to secure these men and
they are endeavoring to engage men
of the very best ability. Each man
will deliver a series of lectures during
his stay at the University.

LUNCH ROOM EQUIPPED

School of Education to Change
Location by Next Year—Im-
provements on Campus. ,

 

A large number of students attended
the last Student Assembly of the
school year, on Wednesday morning,
June 5th. Chancellor McCormick
gave his annualfarewell address of
the year, speaking to .each student
straight from the shoulder. He also
gave a very interesting outline of the
work planned by the University for
next year. Among -many other things
he said that the School of Education
would move into the buildings which
the Pittsburgh Kindergarten College
have occupied up to the time of its
assimulation by the Margaret Morris-
son Schools. This will provide ample
accommodations for the large num-
ber of students who intend to enroll
in this very efﬁcient school next year.
The old Education building on the
campus will be fitted up and used as
a lunch room by the students.

‘The gymnasium, which is being
rapidly equipped, will beopened to
the students at the beginning of the
fall term. Suitable means of access
will also be provided for by that time.

Other buildings needed by the Uni-
versity at the present time, will be
erected as soon as the ‘Trustees see
any possible means of doing so. The
committee engaged in raising the two
million dollar fund is making good
progress and reports that the people
of Pittsburgh .are responding more
readily to -their call than in the past.
The Student Building Fund will be
pushed forward next year with much
zeaL

In closing the Chancellor said:
“The prospects of the University were
never brighter and it is the duty of
every student to advertise the Uni-
versity and its work as much as pos-
sible during the coming summer.

-A movement on foot for sometime
in the University culmina.t_ed:,;i.asit
week in the granting by the lfavéulty
of a charter to a new sorority. This
new secret society has been organized
with twelve members: Lillian McIn-

rority will be named Beta Sigma Tau.

The sorority has alr-eady made ar-
rangements to maintain a‘suite of
rooms for next year. For some time
this. secret socie-ty has been in ex-

' istence, but public announcement has

been withheld until the faculty had
endorsed t-he new organization. Dr.
Fettermann, dean of the college, ex-
pressed himself -as very much pleased

MEDALS AWARDED TO
INTERCOLLEGIATE MEN

 

On Monday morning, June 10, fol-

lowing the regular chapel exercises,

the Chancellor presented the medals
to the intercollegiate debating team.
Pitt being victorious in both debates,
won’ six of the medals awarded by -the
Intercollegiate Association to the vic-
torious teams. _ '

The medals are of solid gold, made
as an exact representation of the uni-
versity seal, 11/; inches in diameter.
The back of which is engraved with
these words: “Awarded to . . . . . . . . ..
in the Intercollegiate Deba'?e, A. D.

In speaking of the splendid work of
the team the Chancellor said that the
training of a debating team is invalu-
able in the preparation for the duties
of after life. i

A vote of thanks and appreciation
was extended to Mr. A. E. Fish. the

trainer of the team, for his untiring C

efforts in the work _of developing the

THE VPITT WEEKLY C

1 SANITARY ADVICE

FOR SUMMER TOURISTS,

The following articl-e was taken
from United States Public Health Re-
ports of May 24, 1912. It is by W. C.
Rucker, Assistant Surgeon General
Public Health and Marine Hospital
Service. ‘

With the advent of warm weather

‘ and the consequent closing of schools

comes the thought of leaving the city
cool country. The tired
teacher and the over—worked clerk,
the restive school boy, anxious to
leave his books for the great out of
doors, the society matron, bored by
the constant round of social duties, all
long to get away from the city and
to spend the summer in some shady
rural re-treat. Too frequently the re-
alization of this happy anticipation is
a hasty return to the city and a long

'stay in the hospital, to be followed,

perhaps, by the death of some loved
one. Much of this may be avoided if
re.asonable care is exercised in the
ch-oice of the place to spend the sum-
mer.

Ordinarily -the questions which are
asked when one is seeking for such a
place include the character of the food
and beds, the extent and nature of the
social life, t'he--temperature of the air,
and the opportunities for bathing. All
of these are important, but -they .are
of secondary‘ consideration as com-
pared with the question of the health-
fulness of the locality iﬁ which it is
intended to spend the warm months.
Therefore, .in choosing a summer
residence the ﬁrst thing to have in
mind is the sanitary environment in
which this time is to be spent.

Every autumn there is a rise in the
number of typhoid cases in the cities,
and when this is investigated it is fre-

-quently found -that they are simply

cases which have been im-ported from
the country. Persons have left the
city in search of health, and, as they
are accustomed to think that health
may be obtained and maintained best
in the country, they accept it without
question as the place to get health.
Typhoid fever is a dis-ease which
su‘.rnmer ‘tourists frequently contract;

therefore it is always well to bear the

avoidance of this disease in mind in
choosing a summer residence. Ty-

' p'hoid fever is a dis-ease of man. The

germ which causes it leaves the body
of the person si-ck with the disease in
his discharges, and when these are
taken by a well person a secondary
case of the disease is caused. The
germs of typhoid fever are carried
from the sick to the well in water and

food and by ﬂies and the ﬁngers. If 1

one does not take into his system the
discharges of another person having
typhoid fever he does not get typhoid
fever. At the present time typhoid
fever is essentially a disease of the
country, because in the country the
opportunities for the transference of
the germs of the disease from the sick
to the well are greater than they are
in the city. Therefore in the choice
of a place to spend the summer one
should inquire into the occurrence of
typhoid fever in the community in
which it is intended to stay, and one
should determine the opportunities
which exist there for the carrying of
the germs of typhoid fever from the
sick to the well visitor.

‘ Since the germ is carried in the dis-
charges of persons sick with typhoid
fever, a careful inspection should‘ be
made of the facilities for disposing of
human excrement. A place which has
a surface privyto which the domestic
have free access
should not be chosen. Places which
have a pit privy or a cesspool situated
only a shortdistance from a well
should be avoided. Places which take
their drinking water from streams

the guest, that the

which receive the drainage of out-
houses or from buildings should like-
wise be. regarded with suspicion.
Other things being equal, places hav-
ing a water supply from artesian or
deep-driven wells should be given the
preference. Unscreened toilets, be-
cause of the ﬂies which they breed,
and because of the chance which these
insects have to pick up the germs of
typhoid fever therein and -carry them
to the boarder’s food, are particularly
dangerous. It is equally import-ant,
both for the comfort and the health of
house also be
screened. _

It has been shown in the foregoing
paragraphs how the ﬂy may carry the
germs of -typhoid fever from the toilet
to the kitchen and there infect the
food which people eat. There is an-
other way in which it may infect food,
and this is particularly important
from the .standpoint of the child. The
source of the milk supply should al-
ways be investigated in choosing a

place of summer residence, and if it is

found, -as is toofrequently the case,
to be from dirty, ﬂy-infested stables,
in which dirty cows are milked by
dirty hands, it is best to» give the
place a wide berth.

Another insect to be avoided is the
mosquito. ,It used to be thought that
mal-aria was «caused by "night air, but
nowadays it is knownthat the only
bad thing ab-out night air is the mos-
quito which it contains. This insect
infects people with malaria by biting
them and injecting the germ as it
bites. Therefore when a place of
summer residence is chosen it should
not be an unscreened house, nor
should it be in a swampy region, not
in a locality inwhich there are small
pools of water well adapted to- the
breeding of mosquitoes.

Finally, if there is any, doubt in the
mind of the summer tourist let him
consult the local health ioﬂicer of the
locality under consideration.

 

GRAND ‘THEATER

 

A sparkling comedy is to be next
week’s delightful attraction offered by

the Harry Davis stock players at the
Grand Opera House, and Th-ais Ma- .

grane, the new leading lady who
scored so brilliantly in “The Spend-
thrift” in its original presentation and
who is to ‘be introduced in it in this
city, will next be seen in the sharply
contrasted comedy role of Celia Far-
aday in “Green Stockings,” the part
originally played in thsislcity by Mar-
garet Anglin. Thisthree-act comedy
of “Green Stockings,” which is thus
to be seen for the ﬁrst time in stock
here at the Grand next week, is the
mirth-provoking masterpiece of the
celebrated novelist and dramatist, A.
E. W. Mason. Like all o.f his stories

and plays it ‘has a deep romantic in- ‘

terest underlying its mirthful surface.
The title is derived from an old Eng-
lish custom which requires an unmar-
ried woman to wear green stockings
at the marria-ge of any younger sister.
To the Celia of Miss Magrane and
Colonel Smith of Robert Gleckler,
next week, Mrs. Andrewts, the new
character woman, will make her bow
wi-th the Davis players as Mrs. Chis-
holm Faraday.

Yale students are complaining be-
cause they do not have enough time
outside of their studies to make as
many friends as they would like.

The University of’ Texas is the
largest university in the South, hav-
ing an enrollment of 1,667.

TO OUR SENIORS.

One short week and the seniors in
have completed
their course, will have received «their

ifdiplomas, and will be ready for what-
. ever awaits them in the great business

world.

The University is sorry to lose
every true senior, every senior that
has really done something for himself
and “Old Uni.” Each true senior
should be sorry to leave the Universi-
ty. If you have done anything for the
betterment of Pitt during the years
you have studied within her walls, if
you have never refused to do anything
for the sake of your Alma,Mater, even
if in doing some things you have .sac-
riﬁuced greatly; if you have lived more
for your fellow students than for
yourself, if you have ‘been faithful in
all things, then you have formed ties
in your University life that will cause
you sorrow to break asunder. As you
go about your work during your last
days as a student of the University of
Pittsburgh -there will be ever present

A a feeliiig of regret that your days as

‘an active student are numbered.
But :it is well to remember that you
are really only starting your best work

_ for your Alma Mater when you receive

your diploma. Everything you do in
the world after graduation will either
bring honor or dishonor to “Old
If you establish a reputation in
the world as a man of integrity, a
manpof ability and a man honored

and respected by all, the University
will be proud that you are a graduate
of P-itt, your class will be proud that
you were .a member of the class of
1912. Every act, good or bad, that
you do will come back in some shape
or form to the University of Pitts-
burgh. Therefore, remember that be-
cause you are no longer _a student at
Pitt is no reason why you should
think your University dutiesare over.
The man that forge-ts his college and
forgets he owes his college. anything
just as soon as he graduates, is not a
real man. The ‘man that remembers
his Ahna Mater and ever keeps alive
his college spirit is the ‘man that -is
remembered and honored by his Uni-
versity as long as his University ex-
ists.

The class of 1912 we believe to be
composed of true seniors, «every one.
If. there be any that are not true
seniors, they ‘know better than any
other person their status. That every
member of the class of 1912 may be
successful in every thing undertaken;
that -everyone may add 'honor and
fame to University of Pittsburgh, as
the years go by, is the wish of th
Pitt Weekly. »

It is with deepest regret -that the
students of this institution received
the news ‘that the oldest graduate of
the University passed away last week.
Services were ‘held last Saturday after-
noon. Pitt looks toward its alumni
and especially its old.er graduates with
respect for the honor they have cast
upon her. A

 

Another year completed.

 

Don’t feel badly, fellows, the girls
still have a chance. It’s leap year dur-
ing the fall term.

Three goods terms deserve three
others.

 

Ques.—-Why are the Seniors like a
river? _
' Ans.—Because they have their com-
mencement in the spring.

 

Remember that you are a son of

Titt ‘Patts

By Prowler.

 

As I sat at my desk the other day
tapping a rum tum tiddle on the arm
of my chair in a vain effort to try to
think of .something interesting to

write for my ﬁnal Prowler column, my»

old and honored friend Mike Flannery
came in for a quiet little chat. It is
only once in a long while that Mike
comes in and I am always glad to see
him. Mike is some Irish gentleman;
now take that tip from me. He has
some ideas of his own on every sub-
ject under the sun, and, thoughex-
pressed in rather homely fashion, the
greater number of his ideas have m'ore
or less hard truth in them.

“The topo’ the mornin’ to ye,” he
said, extending‘ his big Irish hand.
“It’s been a divil of a time since I
gaed upon yer ugly features. Phwat
has ye been doin’ all the time, any-
how?”

“O, nothing much, Mike,” said 1.
“Sit down and make your self misera-
ble and tell what is new.” ,

‘‘It’s me that’s glad to get a wee
breathing spell from some 0’ these
bloomin’. classes,” he said, as he drew
up a chair. “I kinder hanker after
doin’ rale work, me friend. This thing
Q’ answerin’ fool questions in class is
hard on me. And now, lad, don’t it
bate the Old Nick himself the dum
questions a iducated man can asked.
Holy Mother, ’twas only the other
day one 0’ these men sez to me in
class, sez he, ‘Mike, which is the great-
est mountain range in Asia?’ I don’t
know, sor, says I, it’s most time I
have forgotten all sich things. But
if ye want to know, says I, I’ll be after
gettin’ a map 0’ the place for ye.

“And would ye belave it, he got soor,
and sezs tome, ‘your a dumbhead,’ sez
he. ‘The idea 0 ’askin’ a college man
0’ prep school a question loik that.’ ‘I
was a-goin’ to ask him how many men
were killed on each soid at Gettys-
burg. (I knew durn well he could not
answer that.) And then I was goin’
to say to him, your a devil 0’ a good
man on the facts 0’ history, me friend.
But I smothered me wrath.

“An’ .wan night I was workin’ to
bate the /blazes out here, and one 0’
these iducated men pokes his head in
the door and sez, sez he, ‘Mike, are
you workin’? ‘No, sez I. I am sittin’
on this chair to kape it frpm runnin’
away, the janitor went off and left the
door open. Would ye like to take my
job?’ sez 1.

“Well, Mike,” I said, “you seemto
have a speite against education this
morning.”

“No, “sor,” he replied, “not a bate o’
it.' But when a man gits so much
iducation that he has to be averlast-
in’ly botherin’ some less iducated
man, as myself, with his high faluttin’
knowledge, I sez that man is ignorant
wid 1811 his iducation. Never yet did
I see a man that was really smart that
ever pestered anybuddy wid hels
smartness, its always these almost
smarts that worry the life and soul
out 0’ ye trying to peddle off some 0’
their knowledge on ye. Hang ’em_ all,
they would worry a saint, he con-
cluded.”

After Mike had gone, I wondered
how many of us would have to answer
guilty to the charge of being educated
pests.

REPUBLICAN PARTY HOLDS
CONVENTION IN 201 THAW

 

C.

€€€€2€f9f‘3f’3i'3i‘33'3f‘3-**.3.§.3:-.5333

(Continued from Page 1)

E. S. Wasson, delegate from Penn-
sylvania, and a strong Roosevelt man,
easily eclipsed all the efforts of the
other: orators. The manner in which
he knocked the “steamer roller” must
have jarred every part of its mechan-
ism, while his eulogy of Roosevelt
could not have been better if the
Colonel had done it himself. In fact,
Wasson got so boisterous that a gang
of engineers on the ﬂoor above. all of
whom must have been ex-volunteer
ﬁremen, thinking there was a riot in
201, got out a line of hose and tried
to put a damper on the convention
by turning a stream of H20 in the
window. However, the doorkeeper,
or the window-keeper, or whatever he
is, closed the window and frustrated
their efforts.

Representatiye Ely, Iolf‘ l\}l1ew York,
referred to ustice ug es as a
“stable” man. For this bad break the
convention gave Mr. Ely the horse
laugh, and inquired why Justice
Hughes, if a “stable” man, abolished
betting on the races. Mr. Ely apolo-
gized for his mistake, saying he
meant to say s_taple instead of stable,
but it was too late to repair the dam-
age, and every attempt to get Justice
Hughes’ name before the convention
was quickly stalled.

A feature of the convention was the
speech of Miss Roberta Groves (Rob-

»bert Grove) of Idaho, in behalf of

women’s suffrage. Miss Grove made
a very clever speech and urged that
a woman’s suffrage plank be put in
the platform of the Republican party.
The younger politicians in the con-
vention all applauded Miss Grove
vigorously and prolonged. . Miss
Grove is a very handsome blonde, vi-
vacious and witty, which is no doubt
t'he re-ason her speech was so well re-
ceived.

Several controversies arose over the
right of certain delegates to retain
their seats in the convention. Many
serious charges were brought against
some delegates, such as having paid
$50,000 for his seat; robbing an or-
phan asylum, cutting -classes, etc.

One delegate, who must have been
a little under the weather. caused nu-

merous interruptions in the conven-
tion. He seemed to be very dry and
everytime the chairman called
“order! order!” this gentleman would
invariably reply: “Two beers, please.”
All -efforts to quiet him failed. Sev-
eral times he promised to be good,
but in a minute ‘he would again be
demanding a drink.

Just as a vote was to-be cast for the
nomination of the candidate for presi-
dent of the United States on the Re-
publican ticket, .-the class bell rang, and
the convention adjourned at once to
allow the delegates to attend their
classes. , '

The Junior class of Lafayette re-
cently passed a resolution against
treating in any form. Cornell, Mich-
igan .and Princeton were among the
first to taboo treating.

There are 300,000 members of
Greek letter fraternities in America.
The ﬁrst fraternity was organized at
William and Mary College at Will-
iamsburg, Va.,, and called the Flat Hat
Club. Among its members were Ed-
mund Randolph and Thomas Jeffer-

 

‘ SO11. .

Minnesota has. refused to grant
“M.’s” to its football men until they
pay for the damage they caused to a
Northwestern train which took them
to the Wisconsin game. ‘

 

The perfect college yell is deﬁned
as being a cross between the bray of
a Missouri mule and the sound of a
couple of kegs of nails falling down
the cellar steps.

 

Purdue has a walking club of al-
most a thousand members. _

THE‘ PITT WEEKLY »

 

 

PITT HAS GOOD    
TRACK, SEASON

Wins Intercollegiate Meet 4

' . Marshall Breaks Record-—

New Relay Record.

 

It is conceded by followers of -the
cinder path that we have just closed
one of the most successful seasons in
the history of the school. The new
director of athletics, Charles S. Mil-
ler, by hard earnest work has devel-
oped a squad from mo.stly green mate-
rial that has brought credit to Pitt
throughout the season. ' .

The new gymnasium and athletic
ﬁeld were used to an advantage, al-
though the track was not completed,
nor the building fully equipped. Next
year «these things will be in perfect
order and will be the means of devel-
oping an excellent squad.

The season was opened by the in-
door meet on March 9 at Duquesne
Garden. Here before a crowd of four
thousand the athletes met the cream
of the amateur circles in Pittsburgh
and the vicinity.

_ Jim Thorpe, the Carlisle Indian who
will accompany the Olympic team to

, Sweden, was the individual point win-

ner, taking ﬁrst in all the four events
in -which he was entered. ,
Our men were not as successful as
they might have been in this meet,
scoring but two ﬁrsts and several sec-

. orfcls’ and thirds.

Later at the annual Intercollegiate

{games in Pl_ii_1adelphia the relay team
I i ran, an exciting race in which they
‘ V were be.aten by two yards

at the ﬁnish
in very good time. ’

The next Saturday, May 4, was the
interclass meet held." on
Sche.nley Oval. Here _a large squad
competed -and the men who later on

'. proved themselves point winners be-

gan active work. The events were by
no means slow, M.arshal lowering the
half mile college record of 2:04 1-5 to

5” 2:01 2-5, and Manos winning the two-
.mile event in 11:25.

The annual duel meet with  & J.
was held on May 11 at Washington,
Pa., in College park. Here the rack

- was fast and both schools fought hard

for honors, but W. & J. were ﬁnally
defeated by a goodly number of
-points. Here Bryson, the Marshalls,
Rosenthal, Davis, McKinney, Boots,
Polly Galvin and others scored for
Pitt in the several events.

The ﬁfth state. intercollegiate rath-
letic meet held at Harrsisburg, May 18,
was won by Penn State. Pitt was rep-
resented by about ten athletes of
whom Galvin, Marshall, Davis
Rosenthal were the men who scored
for us. The ﬁeld was classy here, with
such men -as Lamb of 4 Penn State,
Garten of Dickinson, Leathers of Get-
tysburg, Brush of W. & J., and Powell
the football star from Carlisle. '

Before a large crowd on Saturday,
May 25, Pitt won the intercollegiate
meet at Schenley Oval. She ﬁnished
with a comfortable lead of 56 1-3
points, while the nearest rival was W.
& J., with 39 1-3 points, Westminster
with 38%» and Grove City with 221/.».
Geneva scored 7 1-3 ‘points.

Of the three records. broken by the
colleges‘ two belong to Pitt. In the
‘half mile Matt Marshall took the lead
at the gun and was never headed, win-
ning in two minutes and '1 second.

and‘

 

 

-:..ot.‘.
Pierce of Grove -‘City took the mile in
a clean race, winning in four minutes
.and thrirty—seven seconds.

The mile relay-was the fastest ever
pulled‘ off on -the Oval. The com-
bination, Heazlett, Davis, Rosenthal
and Capt. Bryson, negotiated the dis-
tance in three minutes 30 3-5 seconds.
Bryson ran one of the fastest races of
his life, leaving his two competitors
far in the distance.

Many of the men are competing in
open amateur meets, as the Y. M. C.
A. and Press meets; These men are
doing good work so far, McKinney
having placed in the pole vault in the
Y. M. C. A. meet and is improving
every day. Rosenthal and Davis will
compete during the summer in several
meets. These men will be a strong
nucleus for next year’s team.

PITT LOSES TO WEST

fought game at D. C. and A. C. P.ark

FUTURE PROSPECTS FOR
» BASEBALL ARE BRIGHT

 

At the conclusion of any athletic
season it is always interesting to look
into the future and forecast the ability
of the next year’s team. Since this is
the tinge of year that our interest nat-
urally centers about baseball and as
the baseball season is rapidly drawing
to a -close it might be well to speak
brieﬂy of some of the players this
season. ‘

All of the members of this year’s
team will return to school next fall,
with the possible exception of Capt.
‘H. T. Koenig, who has been playing
a sensational game at third base. His
steady, consistent playing has en-
couraged his team mates during
many a hard battle.

¢ Allen, who has been on the receiv-

- every game up to date.

in_g end of the battery, has been doing
exceptionally well, having caught
Others who
have been playing excellent ball are
Rectenwald, ﬁrst baseman; Biddle,
second -baseman; Graves, short stop;
Graham and McDowell,’outﬁelders',
and Over, Havenski and Cooper,
pitchers. With ithisvcombination back
again next year the prospects look
exceedingly good for a winning team
next spring.

REVIEW OF BASEBALL SEASON

With the close of the baseball sea-
son only a few days off it might be
well to glance back over the present
season and pass a few -comments.

In many respects the present base-
ball season has not been very success-
ful, but there have been some very
bri-ght spots in the season’s work, and
there are some very good excuses for

. the poor games played. The last .two

weeks has produced some very good
baseball, and shows the fact that Pitt
has some real stuff in the baseball line.
The fundamental cause for the poor

showing of the Gold and Blue in the‘

early weeks of the season was the fact
that our boys had no place to prac-
tice. No person can expect a team,
that has had little or no practice, to
jump in and win the majoijty ofits
games from teams that have had sev-
eral -months of practice before the
season opens. It was hoped that the
new gymnasium would be ready for
use in ~tim.e_for the baseball team to
have ind-oor practice, but this hope
was never realized. Instead of having
the new gymnasium grounds to «prac-
tice on the ﬁrstof May, the team has
had to ‘practice and play its games any
old place that was available. -Such a

\ handicap is very keenlv felt, and is a

decided disadvantage to any team.
One of the weaknesses of the Pitt
nine this year was their weakness at
the bat.
after the season opened nine-tenths of
the members of the team were batting
about .100. But this fact is easily ex-
plained by lack of practice. How
many teams .with as little practice as
the Pitt squad had before the season
opened would make any better show-
ing? Take any man wi.th only a
couple of sessions of batting practice,
and these against pitchers that had
hardly gotten the kinks out of their
arms, put him up against a good team
with a pitcher that has worked in-
side for several weeks and a couple of
weeks outside, how much would you
expect him to hit? Not near .300.
Well, this was just the kind of a prop-
osition the Pitt team was up against
in the ‘batting line. When they went
on the ﬁrst trip the middle of April
the only batting practice they had had
were a few poor sessions at Ormsby
Park. No wonder they could not hit!

It is a wonder every batter did not"

strike out.

The s-ame condition of affairs was
prevalent as regards ﬁelding. If the
boys representing the Blue and Gold
had little batting practice, they had
less ﬁelding practice. And so the ﬁrst
games of season were marked by very
poor ﬁelding, e.rrors being very many
in each game. But as the season grew
older and the players got more prac-
tice the general playing of each man
was bettered 100 per cent.7I‘he fellows
started to make «base hits with a very
pleasing regularity, and the ﬁelders
started to play as if they had been on
a diamond before. Of course, they
did not win every game, but they gave

their opponents something to worry

This year’s tennis season was the
most successful that Pitt his ever had.
The schedule included more large col-
leges than have ever apeared on any
athletic schedule.
ter were the only small colleges played
and each w.as decisively beaten, each
by a score of 6 to 0. On the eastern
trip State College was defeated 5 to
l, and Lafayette by the same score.
Pennsylvania beat Pitt 4 to 2. The
match was very close, Penn having
just a shade on us. Capt. Page of
Penn was beaten by Mackrell of Pitt,
and Ebe also won his match. State
College was later met in Pittsburgh
and defeated 6-0. Cornell defeated"
Pitt 4 to 2. The summaries of the
match showed 81 games for Cornell

Pitt 2 to 1.

Pitt won the stern Pennsylvania
championship for the third time in
succession. Mackrell won Class A
singles and Wright, also of Pitt, won
Class B. Mackrell won the singles
championship by defeating Wright in
three straight sets. The doubles team,
Ebe and Wilbert, made a very poor
showing, losing to Allegheny and
Grove City, and defaulting to Tech.

and 77 for Pi.tt.WI\/Iiiinesota also beat ‘L
e

They could easily have defeated the ~

Tech team, but after losing two
matches to Allegheny and Grove City,
failed to show upand gave Tech the
match. By doing this it placed Tech
a close second to Pitt, where they
should have been considerably lower.

Pitt will send a team to the Inter-
collegiate in Philadelphia in Septem-
ber. All the big colleges will be met
and it is hoped that Pitt will make a
good showing.

Mackrell will be .the only one lost
this year and next year’s team should
be the best ever. Pat Wright is as-
sistant manager this year and will be
manager next year. 5

about until the last man was out in
the ninth.

A good example of the change that
ha.s been wrought in the last few
weeks of the season is the second =Car-
negie Tech game. In ting ﬁrst en-
counter between these teams Pitt was

ignominously defe.ated, not getting a I

safe hit in the entire game. The sec-
ond contest was another story. With
the Pitt boys playing up to their true
form Carnegie Tech was handed a
lemon to the tune of 4-3. The day
after the Tech game Juniata college, a
team that had won earlier in the sea-
son from Pitt by a 4-1 score, was de-
feated in a great game, 5-4. ‘

Little facts like these all go to show
that Pitt is not all bad in baseball.
There is plenty of good material in
-the University to develop a cham-
-pion-ship team in a year or so. -Next
year the new stadium will be ready
for use; indoor practice can be started
in January or February, and when the
baseballseason comes Pitt will be
ready to make a good showing against
all comers. Give the bovs a chance to
make good under favorable conditions
before passing any adverse criticism
on Pitt's baseball possibilities.

meeting of the year during the past
week and made all preparations for

the coming year. Under competent of-
ﬁcials and the instruction of Prof. G.

progress during the few months of its
-existence. Between twenty and thirty
men ‘have taken an active interest in
this sport and from this number six
will be chosen to represent the Uni-
versity in the matches next year. The
manager has arranged for a series of
matches with the Pittsburgh Athletic
Association, the German Club, the
Westinghouse Club and several col-
leges. in this vicinity. These matches
will serve as elimination contests in
the picking of the men who will rep-
resent the University in case admis-
sion is gained into the Intercollegiate
League of America. As a token of
the esteem and respect with which
Prof. Po_stgat.e is held by the club, and
also as a slight recognition of his
earnest endeavors during, the past
year, the members will present him

with a handsome Italian duelling
sword, whichwill be suitably en-
graved.

The ofﬁcers for the coming year
will be: I
