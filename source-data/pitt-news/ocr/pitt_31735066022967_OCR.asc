Ofﬁcials have set a target date of summer, 1980 for the
start of the long awaited Schenley Hall renovation project.
The'$.10.5 million plan announced last week by Andy
Smith, director of the Ofﬁce of Student Activities and
Associate Director Terry Milani calls for a massive
reconstruction. of the ﬁrst eight ﬂoors of the building

including the basement.

Milani said he believes the most feasible mode, of

funding for the project is to include the costs in the
student’s tuition, after the construction in completed.
According to Milani the only outside sources of funding for
the project at its onslaught might be student funds, with
minimal support from the university capital funds
campaign. ’ ’ -

In past years, a student union fee was suggested as the
most desirable method of funding. The undetermined fee

EnrollmentlncreaseAnnounced At SenateCouncil »  

‘He also reported, that last year’s

By MICHAEL ALLEN‘

Chancellor Wesley Posvar re- 0

ported‘ Monday to the University
Senate Council that enrollment is
on an upswing following last year’s
declines. ’

Posvar’s report stated ‘that

undergraduate enrollment isgup 11
percent. Seven percent of that
reﬂects new freshman enrollment,
158 more students than last year’s
total of 2,260. ' The balance of the

-increase is due to 863 transfer
students, Posvar said.

“There has (also) been an
increase in minority students,
there’s no ﬁgure-now, but they
should be available soon” the
chancellor stated.

\

“Of the ' 13 urban public
universities that we are afﬁliated
with, 7 had decreases, the
reaminders, increases, but not
comprable to our own. We had the
largest of any of those institutions.

“The increases are largely due to 0‘

the vigorous efforts of Joe Merante
(director of admissions) and his
staff for recruiting new students,
good students,” Posvar said-

_ Scholastic Aptitude Test scores for

incoming freshmen remained
stable compared to those of the
class of 1982. The mean for verbal
tests is 460, 520 for mathematics.

Both ﬁgures are above the
national average, Posvar said,
adding that 92 percent of new
students were in the upper 2/5 of
their graduating high school class.

»\Posvar also listed factors that
attracted new students to the
university determined by an
admissions ofﬁce survey. \

The primary factor was Pitt’s
academicfreputation, followed by
the advice of parents and friends,"
with promotional material given
the least weight by students in‘
making their decision, Posvar said.

“That is the order .we would like
to see those functions,” he added.

In spite of all the enrollment
increases reported, the chancellor
said the. net gain is still up in the
air. Figures on student retention
have not yet been compiled.

“We do not know the results of A '
what effect retention‘ may be,

which may adversely affect the

increased ‘enrollment ﬁgure,” Pos- _
_var stated. .- '

Also reported at the meeting
were the issuing» of grants for
research in the ﬁelds of childhood
diabetes,’ adolescent learning dis-
abilities and a 1.5 million dollar
grant from the ‘Mellon foundation
to the medical school. -

In other business, David Huff-
ner, president of the School of
General Studies Cabinet, reported
that his organization is planning a
series of workshops on writing
resumes (Sept. 25), job interviews
(Sept. 27) and rape and self-'
defense, which has yet to be
scheduled. g ‘

Huffner also stated that the
ofﬁces of the SGB Cabinet have
been moved from 360 Cathedral ‘of
Learning to room 443.

Watch

PROBABLY JUST ABOUT ALL
YOU ARE SPENDING SOME OF
THE FIRST COUPLE OF WEEKS
DlS—.OR REDISCOVERING
Oakland & the rest of town...the
best places to eat, drink oriust to
get some peace & quiet. Part of the
process is figuring out Pgh. radio.
Radio classifes itself by what
each particular station plays,
whether it be country, top 40, mid-
dle of the road, album oriented
rock, religion, etc. For our pur-
poses we will discuss only music
stations that try to reach the
college market. .-
The newest type station is the

easy rock. Although this beautiful,

music for young adults has proven
unsucessiui in other markets, Pit-
tsburgh has accepted it. Not only
has FM .9? (WFFM) become a major
factor for Pgh. listeners & adver-
tisers, at least two other stalons in
town—WKTO 1320 am (the old

,130) and WWSW 970 AM (ex

double country, ex middle of the
road) are now following the format.
Basically, easy rock is for folk &
pop listeners who can do without
the energy level of a Ted Nugent of
Led Zeppelin. .

130’s change to KTO & format
leaves the AM side of Pittsburgh
top 40 less—so it’s a quick switch
to PEZ (94FM). Don't write PEZ off
just because there's an old stigma
about top 40, WPEZ will give you a
chance to hear some excellent late
60's & early 70’s hits as well as
keeping you up to date on what's
hot. And if you miss it during the
week, there's always Casey Cason
Sunday Mornings.

Then, for those of you who don’t ’

care for any one certain style—and
Just like your radio music
recognizable, listehable,
somewhat rock, pop, disco, folk,
top forty, & commercially
professional, try 96
(WXKX—FM).

That’s the lighter, more univer-

sial side of Pgh. radio: We'll get in-

to the rockers, jazz and R & B and
non-commercial stations next
Wednesday. a
More interested in playing than
listening? Head to Holiowood
Music, and ask about the lbanez
line of guitars. Up to a few years
ago, lbanez, a Japanese firm, was a
copy sound and look like the big
name companys. They did it so

well, though, that Gibson sued— _

and prompted lbanez to design a
new unique line. Now lbanez is

comparable in quality & workman- '

ship to the “brand names”; in fact
worked with George /Benson for
their artist series.

Before we forget, thanks to all of
you who took advantage at our 3.99
rubber plants and offer this advice:
Don't over water them! __Rather, give

__them about two weekd between

showers, or untill the plant feels
almost completely dry. Also,
sunlight helps. I

And, finally this week take ad-
vantage oi our small plant
specials, where you can get
zebras, ferns, and such for ¢79 to
1.79. it’s the 3 to 4 inch pots, the
plants between 6 & 16 inches.

Till Wednesday.

At Tuesday NightSGB Meeting -

(Continued from page I)
committee for new allocations
members be waived during the
upcoming revampment of her
group. -—

“The allocations committee feels
that since all of its members have
reapplied .for the positions they
hold now it should reject having
current members sit on the ad hoc
committee,” she said, explaining a
conflict of interest could result.
SGB president Stan Galanski and
other boardmembers have expres-

sed a desire to inject “new blood,” ‘

into the allocations committee and
re-evaluate its current policies and
procedures.

Warren’s proposal was unani-
mously approved by the board.
The ad hoc committee is composed
of three SGB members, Galanski,
Kim Watterson and Cindy De-
Matteo.

The board also heard Will
Gorham of the Seabrook Support
Group, a city anti-nuclear associa-
tion. Gotham -asked the board's

Mandatory Class Attendance Set

support in organizing a similar
group on campus—-none exists
now—and most board members
voiced their approval. _

Glenn Meyer, a Penn State
student cross-registered here and
who is conducting a survey of
student Oakland apartment tenants
for the Legal Awareness Board
distributed copies of the survey for
board review.»

The survey lists 15 questions that -

include listing the tenant‘s affilia-
tion with the university and the,
type of [lease the tenant signed.

“We want to see if certain
groups are being discriminated
against,” Meyer said about the
former question, and commented
on the latter by saying, “leases
around here are horrible. They
violate civil rights left and right.‘

“Some leases have clauses that
sign away your right to represent-
ation (in court). ‘Most landlords in
Pittsburgh use standard leases that
are horrible.“ ,

The board also discussed the

proposed new campus bus=route
after member Tom Kunkel quest-
ioned the need for running buses
along an extended line during
daylight hours.

The rationale given most lip
service by board members for
protracting the line into North and
South Oakland is increased secur-
ity.

“During the day...there’s less,
chance of getting ‘raped, mugged,
etc.,” Kunkel said. '5

Watterson replied that despite
that possibility, the route as it
exists eliminates service to South
Oakland student residents while it
does facilitate campus access to
North Oakland by traveling up
Belleﬁeld Street to Center and
Aliquippa Streets.

“People in South‘;.0akland have

_ to viialk 15 to '20- minutes up to the

Syria Mosque (to board the bus at
itslcurrent first stgp). That’s not
fair,” she said.

For Some ClassesAt Duquesne  

By NANCY LYNCH

' A Attendance problems in several
lower level courses at Duquesne
University triggered deparrnents in
the _College of Arts and Sciences
there to adopt a mandatory
attendance policy.

According to the new policy,
students that attain more un-
excused absences than twice the
number of credits in a course will
receive a failing, grade.

The English, classics, journal-
ism, modern langu-age, political
science, physics and speech de-
partments at Duquesne have

adopted the policy, and the M

.chemistry department " imple-
mented it for labs and recitations
only, according to an article

appearing in last week's issue of,
the university's ,
A student newspaper. '

‘ ‘The Duke, ”

Irwin Schulman, dean of the
college of arts and sciences _and‘ a
political ‘science instructor at Pitt,
disagrees with the‘ mandatory
attendance policy, and doesn't
believe it shoud be implemented
here.

“I don’t believe in too much
compulsion on students. I feel that
college students are adults." They
pay tuition and if they don’t feel,
like going to class they. shouldn’t

_' have to. '

"‘I don’t require attendance in
my political science 50 class. He

added, “butthere is a lot to be said
on» both sidesvof the issue.”
A James Knapp, acting chairman
of the English Department, be-
lieves it is up to the ‘teacher to
draw a crowd. ‘ '
“Most of us always assumed
students learn better when they
want to be there and think the class
is worthwhile.” _
‘.‘,I never think it’s a good idea‘ to
force * people to do anything.
‘Undergraduates pay for their
education. They should be allowed
to decide if there’s anything useful
/in~ the course,” said‘ Tony
Magistrale, also of the.‘ English
Department. ' ‘ ‘

“It should be left up to individual .
teachers to decide when attendance.

is necessary,” said Jack Matthews,
chairman of the speech depart-
ment. “It depends upon the nature
of the course.”

Lynn Emanuel teaches lower

- level English ‘writing courses and,

believes tl_I’at mandatory attend-
ance “deﬁnes education as‘ a
matter ofvputting your body in a
chair three times a week. .

' “Students would go to class and

I sit sullenly. They wouldn't think or

work because they’d feel that they
had fulfilled the requirement.”
In- the physics department,

Garfunkel, there isn’t_an attend-
ance problem. _

Members of Pitt’s Delta Sigma
Chi concluded an eight month
battle with the City of Pittsburgh’s
Sanitation Department to have its
garbage removed. “ _

According to Andy ~Melzer,
fraternity president, garbage
hadn't been collected at the Forbes
Avenue house in ﬁve wgeks.
The pile was frequently ignited
from persons in the vicinity of the
area.
claimed to have called an average
_of four to ﬁve -times "a week
reporting on the situation but

The fraternity president.

received no response to his pleas to
have it taken away.

“Since Delta Sigma Chi pays
taxes like anyone else in .the
community we feel an injustice is
taking place,” said Melzer. It all
started out in January with the pile
getting progressively higher and
trash pickups fewer. The weeks
passed into the month of May when
the fraternity ordered a new
dumpster. A definite lack. of
communication between Delta
Sigma Chi and the ‘Sanitation
Department was at _the root of the
problem,” Melzer said. ’

Melzer believes it gave the

fraternity bad publicity, which is
something no fraternity wants.
“Things were just getting out of
hand and people were probably
thinking that a bunch of slobs live
said ,Melzer.
Last Friday, they took more
decisive steps which included
having the members of ‘Delta
Sigma Chi pose as citizens of the
community on -the telephone

complaining about "the ﬁlth. They

also placed another sign “If this
garbage makes‘ you sick call

, 255-2773 (City Refuge Number).”

This prompted some action, and
on Friday," September 7, after

, .

numerous calls to the city refuge
department, a dump truck and two
workers arrived to haul the mess
away. It took with the assistance of
the fraternity brothers, ﬁfteen to
twenty minues to load the debris,
but it‘was ﬁnally hauled away.

When asked why there was so
much trouble with this particular
case, Robert Luis, Chief Planner in
the City Refuge Department,
charged that the fraternity has a
faulty dumpster (container which
holds garbage) without an eyehook
and wheels to unload the garbage
in the ftruck. The department

would make‘ occasional stops to
manually pick up some on _ the

was not feasible to unload the- rest

project of four hundred containers

to be notiﬁed.

Opinion -

_ Renovation Plan

Not Enough

After ten long years of waiting, Pitt students can
now look forward to renovation of Schenley Hall,
which has been discussed and promised by more than
three generations of directors of the Office of
Student Activities. Andy Smith, the new director of
student activities, has gone further than his predeces-
sors, however, and has presented a plan with a price
tag and a tenative date for the beginning of eonstruc-
_tion. _ ,
If The renovations could bring a’ much needed new

look to the Student Union if the present proposal of '
student activities i_s followed.. Included would be an .

‘addition to the present. building’ with offices°for

I student groups, ,a restaurant complete with bar, eight
‘ ‘handball courts, exercise rooms and a suana. Such

joyable place where students could relax. Still, other
aspects of the Schenley Hall are disturbing and must
be given very close scrutiny. '

-One of the disconcerting parts of the renovation
plan is the exceedingly small space allotted to in-
dividual organizations. Under the proposal all small
organizations like College Young Democrats and
Pershing Rifles would have offices in one large room
split by partitions. It seems unfair to slight these
organizations by lumping them together in one room
where they receive a partitioned space two—thirds of
the size of a double room in the Towers. If any
organization is to exist as a viable part of campus .
life, it needs more than a 6 foot by 10 foot room in
which to carry on its daily business. V ‘ '-

Other groups are shortchanged in a similar ‘way.
According to the renovation plans, Backspace
magazine recei’ves only a‘-1U foot by 12 foot ‘room and '
the periodical that is supposed to be the literary jour-
nal of -the university certainly deserves more -space’
than this‘. ‘ "' '

Page 6—Wednesday, September 12, 1979 «

The committees of the SGB would also loose office
space, sharing a common suite split by partitions into
spaces only 10 feet by 12 feet. -Thisarrangement
would cheat the more active committees like the
Legal Awareness Committee, which now has its own
office. Since._the Legal Awareness Committee must
handle a deluge of phone calls each day and inter-
views with clients, it seems ridiculous to expect the
group to operate effectively from partitionedarea of
such small dimensions. _

We welcome with open arms this new step towards
a renovated Schenley Hall. But,_.we also believe any
renovations must serve adequately the needs -of
student organizations, and offices slightly larger than
a Towers‘ room certainly cannot do so. If the Office
of Student Activities wants to be fair to student

_. groups,othey should enlarge the scope of its_plans to
allow-more spaceto student organizations.“ The of-

fice must not forget that these offices must be a work
area and ‘home-away-from-home for students in-

additions certainly would rnake Schenley Hall an en-

I THOUGHTQIIDD-EVEN WAS OVER.

Distorted Image o f LatinA mericansin Un ion LatinaS tory

r We want to take this prudent
opportunity to ﬁrst of all extend our
gratitude for providing us with
courtesy and journalistic access.

It is imperative that we clarify
some sensitive points of misinter-
pretation which surfaced.,in your
otherwise ﬁne article of Sept. 5,
1979. ' ‘

As a newly emerging student

organization, our main intent was s
to introduce our organizational

ideals to the university community
and most especially to our Latin
American“ brothers. Instead what
climaxed was an utter distortion of
.p’ar_ticu1arities, an image of Latin
Americans as being inherently
incapable of conquering the ameni-
ties of culture "shock, an erroneous
and indiscreet misinterpretation of
some “off the record” examples,
which incidently were made to
further elaborateand emphasize on
our organization’s afﬁliation with
legal counselors. '
{,This very sensitive blunder has

caused within our Latin American
community some brow raising and

_ thus the climate for disunity.

By singling out the nationality of

one of our brothers, you have

embarrassed not only the in-
dividual, but have slandered his
national identiﬁcation, and along
the ‘way our entire hemispheric
image.

We hereby wish to extend our
most sincere apology to our
Venezuelan comrades, in light of
this misinterpretation which was
beyond our control. We want to
emphatically make it very clear and

accurate that no harm was ever ‘

intended..We extend our hand of
solidarity and welcome you as well
and all our other Latin American
brothers to take part "incur. cause.

Our main concern and sincere

interest is to solidify our cultural '

hegemony, through our -physical
unification and affirmation of
cultural pride. The mentality of our
ideals is not one of separatism or

nationalistic isolation, on the
contrary our aim-is of service and

‘social comradery , and happy co-

existence.

We are very proud to be Latin, _

Americans, we feel that this pride
should be proclaimed and afﬁrmed.
We have a way’ of being, and
believe the world needs that way of
being to be present. We would risk

supplies unless some way can be
found to limit the amount of gas
generated bybean eating. "

The goal of the university tests
will be to obtain information that
would help breed beans that
produce less gas or that would
enable scientists to remove gas-
producing elements from the food.

o Pitt News Staff Writer
Saturday’s season-opening foot-
ball game could turn out several
different ways», depending on

. who's doing the talking. The boys

in Vegas list the Panthers as a
19-point favorite, but Pitt Coach
Jackie Sherrill is a bit wary of the
contest. _

“Our players respect Kansas,”
Sherrill said at yesterday’s media
' gathering. He elaborated by

‘pointing out the Jayhawks have a_

slight advantage psychologically,
because this is the beginning of a
new era for them, and ‘playing an
opponent with a national reputation
such as Pitt’s will probably bring

out their best possible perform-‘

’ The Kansas‘ coach, Don Fam= ‘

A brough, is somewhat of an enigma.

One minute he thinks his team is
pretty good, and the next minute
he wonders if it might not be better
to stay home. i .

- “We really don’t know how good

we are, and certainly, playing the
University of Pittsburgh, we'll ﬁnd
out real quick,” said -Fambrough.
“We. don’t have the big people up
front that you need to compete with

_Pittsburgh, Michigan and some of

the teams from the. Big 8
Conference. ’ ’

The Jayhawks are quarterbacked
by Kevin Clinton, a strong-armed
sophomore whose forte is passing.,

Kansas installed a pro-style attack

this year, .shelving the wishbone-,
and Clinton is the key. According
to Sherrill, the Panthers hope ,.to
apply a good pass rush in order to
make Clinton leave the pocket and
be forced to scramble, something

Field Hockey Team
Begins Fourth Season

ByMARIEHUFF

Contrary to popular belief, the
women's ﬁeld hockey program still
exists at Pitt. They will be entering
their fourth year of competition,
rebounding from a 3-5 record last
season.

Coach Audrey’ Gerginski cites
rumors of the program's discon-

__tinua'nce as the major reason for

the squad’s diminished size. “Last

year we ﬁelded both a varsity and
junior varsity team._ This year we
may have to go with just a varsity
squad,” she notes. Another big
setback came when six or seven
players transferred to other
schools. Still, Gerginski remains
very optimistic.

“Im pleased with number of
freshmen we have. ‘As a matter _of
fact, two of them will probably
sharengoalieduties-this year. ” "She

By ANNA ARLOTTA

When the Pitt soccer team takes
the ﬁeld for tonight’s home opener
many of the players will be thinking
about last season’s 3-2 opening loss
to the Midwestern soccer power.

Akron was the team which
touched off the » Panthers’ 6-8
season. Six-eight is not exactly

something to write home about.
Even though eight out of the first
11 Panthers have played on the Pitt
team in years past, there is still a
new look this season. Akron no

longer looms as an insurmountable
obstacle, it is a team the Panthers
.would just love to beat.
This time Pitt is not only ready to
face Akron, but the players feel

The soc\cer teams got its kicks by beating the school's alumni, but tou
contest.

ALL POSITlONS

Panther alumni was any indication
of Pitt’s ability to finish strong,

success may lie in the near future.

Pitt was able to soundly beat an
experienced alumni squad 5-1.
Leading the offense will be
co-captain Jeff Tissue playing at
left wing. To his right at center
forward will be freshman Eric
Tiedtke and right wing Barry Stein.
In Friday’s contest both Tissue and
Tiedtke scored a goal apiece and
Stein had four close shots at the
net. Coach Leo Bemis also has a
number of backup forwards ‘to add
depth to the squad.

The responsibility of connecting
the Pitt defense to this front line
will be_ in the hands of three
midﬁelders. ‘ _The only returning
Panther‘ in this position is
sophomore Al Addlemann on the
right side. Addlemann will be
joined by ‘Werner Woodmannin
the middle, and Bob Hughes on the
left; both scored goals in the
alumni contest. With the ball
control of Woodman, and“ the
hustling of Addlemann » and
Hughes, the game should prove to
be an ‘interesting one. Here again,
Bemis has a good deal of depth as
he still has a number ofutop-notch
midﬁelders available onthe bench.

“With the depth that we have
offensively, we should be able to

ﬁndimany combinations that will

produce goal_s,’_’ said Tissue. ‘ ‘The

' ‘potential and the abilityis present,

alliwe-have to dois use it.” I

’ ‘ Scoring goals is certainlynot the

only stipulation to winning a soccer
game. A strong defense that is
consistent in stopping the opposi-
tion counts just as much. Moving
hack to the sweeper position this
_year will be Tom Liebenguth.

on the Panther tennis team, has
only been with the Panther soccer
team for one year. In front of
Liebenguth will be Tom Kunkel,
Jerry Tomasetti, and Jim Hacks-

‘worth; Kunkel is the only returnee

from last year’s team. Hackworth
and Tomasetti have _both played
with the Panthers in previous years
and are now trying to make
comebacks.

One person who will be glad to
know he has four strong fullbacks
around will be the Panther
goalkeeper, Scott Thunberg.
Thunberg, only a sophomore, will
get the starting nod for tonight’s
game. One of twostarting goalies
on last year’s team, Thunberg won

-three games and lost four, with all

three wins coming as shutouts.

No matter how prepared the
Panthers will be tonight, Akron will
nevertheless present some fierce
competition. They have been one
of the top-ranked teams in the
Midwest in past years, and this
season should be no exception. In
Akron’s first contest of this year, a
0-0 battlewas fought with Eastern
powerhouse. Penn State. . -With
a showing such as .this, Akron,
under the instruction of Coach Bob
Dowdy, will want to register its
first win. _

important one_in.showing us just
what kind ofteam we_.are going to
develop into,”
Hughes.
together for almost three weeks
now and all the players are getting
used to each other’s styles of play.
Tonight’s game should be a good
one.”

One of the new faces on the
Pitt tennis courts is that of head L.
coach ‘Louise Rick. She
climaxed her playing career at
West Chester State College in
1976, when ‘she captured the
Pennsylvania State Conference
title in doubles competition.
This year she looks to improve
upon the team’s '8-4 record in
1978. _

Many followers would be-

lieve_ the team should H be
weaker with the loss of ‘the,
number one and- two‘ players
from last year, Maria Paris and
Janet DeCostro. A quick look
at last year’s records, however,
show that junior Randi Belkin
(11iO) and sophomore JLisa A
LaFuria (10-2) could fill those
spots. Also returning is senior
Jan Brownstein (6-S-'1), who .

John Belushi Talks About His Career

By PATTY TASCARELLA

' John Belushi, Samurai Everyman,
erstwhile Blues Brother and probably the
biggest reason behind the resurgent
interest in fraternities across the country,
insisted in a recent phone interview that
he will deﬁnitely remain a regular on

NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” for yet
another season.

“I intend to stick with it,” Belushi said.

“My contract won’t be up for awhile, but '

that’s not the main thing. I have
emotional ties‘to ‘Saturday Night Live.’ ”

Certainly, Belushi’s roots are in satiric
television, in both writing and acting. He
started out, in his native Chicago, with
the infamous “Second City,” wrote and
starred in several National Lampoon
off-Broadway shows before proving
himself the Not Ready for Prime Time
Player most likely to be prime. But his
other sources said Belushi is suffering

"from a conflict of interests and that

“Saturday Night” is most likely to be
sacriﬁced.

“Look,” said National Lampoon writer

Eric Greenberg, “Belushi wants out. He.

wants the movie offers and he's ready to
move out. NBC has him over a‘ barrel.”

Sources at NBC have been cautiously
admitting that Belushi has been
“restless” about returning to the show.

“I might not appear in every episode,”
said Belushi. “I didn’t last year. But, I
will be back. Truth is, I’ve gotten a-lot of
ﬁlm offers since ‘_‘Animal House” but
nothing has appealed enough to conflict
with my plans for ‘Saturday Night.’
Should that happen, I really don’t know
what l’ll be doing, but it hasn’t.”

Belushi.said that he intends’ to become ’

even more involved with the writing end
of the show.

“We'll be trying some’ new things

out,” he said. “But we are still keeping Q

SHOWCASE on L.

‘ Christmas

some of the skits like The Nerds and The
Wide-ettes. We tried to phase out The

' Coneheads but there was a lot of reaction,

we got a lot of letters wanting us to bring
them back. I think overuse ruins a lot of
good comedy and we try not to repeat
routines.”

Belushi said that the line-up of guest

hosts will include return performances by

Steve Martin and -Buck Henry.

“It hasn’t all been settled yet,” he
said. “But we plan to have Brooke
Adams (star of “Days of Heaven” and
“Invasion of the Body. Snatchers”) and
Steve Spielberg.

Spielberg, director of “Jaws” and
“Close Encounters of the Third Kind,”
recently directed Belushi and. fellow
“Saturday Night”-er Dan Aykroyd in
“1941.” The ﬁlm is slated for .a
release
enthusiastic about it.

“I want to show that ‘Animal House’
wasn't a ﬂuke,” hesaid. “And I want to
show I can act in a quality production. I
had a great time doing “1941.” Danny is
a great person to work with and Steve is
just a genius.” .

Belushi played a bit part in Jack
Nicholson’s “Going South” between
ventures. The ﬁlm flopped, though
Belushi received critical praise.

“That ﬁlm was ruined in the cutting .

room,” he said. “I don’t even want to
talk about it.” A

Belushi has no desire to become a
“serious actor,’~'- he said.

“I like what Ido," he said. “Making
people laugh is a great way of life. I love
comedy, I -love satire. I don’t want ‘to
play ‘Hamlet.’ ‘ I’d like to make. my own

' ﬁlms someday,’ write, direct and star.

The best way to learn to do that is what
I'm doing now, working with quality
directors like Steve Spielberg.
magazines wrote the other day that I'm

trying to playgsex symbols since I’ve lost

Entertainment    

and Belushi is '~

.Greenberg.

Some. -

some weight (Belushi lost 15 pounds on
the Scarsdale Diet over the summer),
they like to portray me as being on a
power trip. Look, I have no desire to
replace Johnny Carson, host my variety
show) or ride to work -with John
Chancellor. Power is in creating, not
exploiting. ’ ’

“The good thing about this show is we
have a lot of opportunity to try new
things. Censors have been a pain in the
ass, sure, but we get away with more than
any television show in history. Look'at
the Smothers Brothers. They had the
best show on TV about ten years ago and
CBS . cancelled them because they
offended the censors. When I think of
what we do, it’s so ironic. ‘Times have
changed and the thing is to change with
them.” '

Greenberg, a friend from Belushi’s
Lampoon, days, is less sure about
Belushi’s goals.

“John power trips like crazy,” said
“Listen, the relationship

between ‘Pooh and “Saturday Night” is

" not reciprocal. We create and they proﬁt

by stealing our writers. I’m not saying
John isn’t extremely talented, but he’s in
a position to call some shots and it’s
ruined many talented men and Belushi

‘ could go down easy.”

“I think I’ve got a pretty goodigrasp on
the situation,” Belushi said. “There are

r certain things I want to do and in good
! time, I’ll do them.

I’m having an
incredible time now, there’s just so much
going on and _I really have to choose

‘ carefully. ’ ’ 4 '

One") thing "Belushi has ‘deﬁnitely

vetoed is Lampoon’s proposed sequel to

‘ ‘Animal House.’ ’

“I want to do other things,” he said.

J “Maybe they can hire Josh Mostel or

something.’ ’ _ ~

‘Impermanence! Permanence’Sculpture 

By JANICE SCHULER

’ Using the theme of “Impermanence/
Permanence,” the Society of Sculptors
are presenting an outdoor and indoor
show, which opened Sunday and runs
through Sept. 30.

The outdoor pieces‘using impermanent
materials are largely monumental in size.
They were built on a site chosen by the
artist amidst the 25 acres of forest in
Mellon Park. Some of the impermanent

materials" include hay, uncoated plaster,‘

grass, burlap, dirt, cellophane and
cardboard. The indoor exhibition in the
Arts and Crafts Center Gallery required
sculptors to submit pieces of a permanent
nature.

 Although there are few memorable

pieces in the indoor show, the idea of
monumental sculpture, impermanent or
otherwise, is novel to Pittsburgh and
provides an opportunity for the public to
observe sculptors at work. (Construction
was from August 1-September 6.) It also
allows us to view art out of the sometimes
sterile and intimidation Context of the
gallery space.

The juror, Robert Lepper, Professor
Emeritus of Design from Camegie-
Mellon University reﬂected on the
outdoor show.

“The show qualiﬁes as a great event!
In artistry it is the first I know of in the
area to invite the makers to engage in
dialogue with the grounds, with the lay of
the land. Mellon Park is magniﬁcent for
this purpose with its two and three way

slopes, little ravines, assorted knolls and
splendid‘ trees. The land, slipping

band ﬁlled with intense pride and gutty
determination.

Each one of these vital elements
combined most favorably for the Iron City
Houserockers’ open air concert on the
gigantic Pitt Student Union patio. For an_
hour-and-a-half, Pittsburgh’s homegrown
Houserockers sizzled with some of the
hottest rock n’ roll to be found anywhere.

Clearly, the Houserockers held nothing’

back and perhaps delivered one of their
ﬁnest shows to date. I ,

But, who said it was going to be easy?
The Rockers had to push themselves hard
to win askeptical collegiate crowd, many
of whom probably had never caught a
Houserocker set in any of the local
watering holes. -

Nonetheless, four songs into the show

from their debut album, there, was no

turning back for the smoking House
rockers. In what could be termed a

- crucial, if not pivotal show, the Iron City

Houserockers appeared to have earned
Pitt’s overwhelming approval and some
much needed hometown support.
Playing a little old, a little new and a lot
fromits one-and-only album, the seven

piece band meshed together a tight, ,

rollicking afternoon. Leader Joe

Grushecky conducted his Houserockers

through some 17 songs, including three
dynamic new tunes, “I Don’t Wanna Go
to School,” “Don’t Let Them Push You
Around” and a special homage to the
Steel City, “Don’t Stop the Music-.” This
new material is slated for the next

Houserockers album due to be recorded

in three months. I

antics especially during “Turn It Up” and
the group's double encores.

Crackling guitarist, Eddie Britt, the
newest Houserocker, flashed a clean,
searing lead guitar throughout the show,
but during “Don’t Let Them Push You
Around” and “Hideaway,” he really
shined. _

Lead singer Grushecky took control
with his stunning vocal performance on
“I’m Lucky,” which brought the Pitt
crowd to its feet and kept it there.
Grushecky constantlyipushed his, rough,

-growling voice to the limit, outdoing his

album performance by a long shot.

More important than each individual,
however, was the overall impression the
Iron City Houserockers made as a solid‘,
capable band with a strong collection of
songs and a fast-paced,’ electrifyingract.
They could not have picked a better time
to prove themselves.

Their appearance here was so success-‘

-ful that the Houserockershad practically

to beg to end their show so they could do
it again at the Decade Lounge later that
night. Ironically, this show conﬁrmed the
Houserockers_are not just another bar
band. '

With credentials like that, the'future
appears golden for these iron rockers.

By THOMAS PALMER

The Seduction of Joe Tynan

Directed by Jerry Schatzberg

After, acting in the shadows of Jane
Fonda in “California Suite”, and Ellen

If , Burstyn in “Same Time, Next Year”,

Alan Alda has ﬁnally caught the focus of
the public eye in “The Seduction Of Joe
Tynan.” , _
“Seduction,” written by Alda, was
formerly titled “The Senator,” but
Universal persuaded him to rename it in
order to grab more attention and

possibly box-office dollars from those not

familiar with the ﬁlm’s subject.

Political themes in ‘ﬁlm must be
forceful and compelling, along with being
intelligent and accurate, without drag-

' ging the viewer through a labyrinth of
political jargon and boring procedure.
Using Alda’s admirably written screen-
play, Director Jerry Schatzberg has made
’a ﬁlm founded on, and revolving around
political life, while still containing an
appeal to those less informed or less
concerned about the workings of the

' government. '

Alda plays a affable, «Kennedy-type
liberal from New York, whose youth,
drive, voter appeal, wit, and honest
politicking destines him to travel the road
to the presidency.
watchable «as Joe Tynan and carries the
(self-written part of the senator smoothly.
From his haggling as the senator to
lighter moments with his family, Alda
never seems awkward or out‘ of place.
Not an award-winning performance, but
deﬁnitely one of his best.

Tynan is a man ~whose 'political
aspirations outweigh his concern for
personal affairs. He is a man looked to
for leadership. When a Supreme Court
appointee is considered by certain civil
rights groups to be a man with past racial
admonitions Tynan decides to step in.
Unsure if the man is a bigot or not, Tynan
decides to lead the blockage of his
conﬁrmation, because he would receive
exposure and be in a better position to

' . reach his political expectations, prefer-

ably, the presidency. Butthis is only
tacitly understood, and Tynan never

mentions his intentions out loud. He_

becomes caught up in himself; his power
and inﬂuence.

His relationship with his family,
however, is on no such upswing. His wife
Elly(Barbara Harris) feels alienated from
her husband‘ and his job. Her bitterness

 e for the political world begins to ferment

as his involvment with leading the senate
investigation begins to take precedence
over his concern for his children.

Tynan senses the decay, but even as he -

I gropes to regain a-‘hold on his family, the
call of his job, and. his newly found
mistress, Karen (Meryl Streep), eats his

~ marriage away from the inside-out.

Barbara Harris is excellent as Tynan’s
"intelligent wife, a woman who underwent

psychiatric care at the start of Tynan’s
political career and eventually made
therapy‘ her career. She has no qualms
about telling all this to a repporter from
McCall’s, much to the consternation of
Tynan and his aides. _ -

The third point in the triangle, the
mistress played by Meryl Streep, is a
beautiful Southern lawyer who compiles
information for Tynan as he mounts his
senate hearing offensive.

Alda and director Schatzberg’s best
scenes are probably the lighter ones with
Streep and Alda; a high-energy episode
of foreplay while standing in a hotel room

’ and an amusing, yet slightly clicheed

-scene where Tynan pays the aggravating

\

price of fame as his attempt to check into
a semi-secluded hotel with Streep proves
difﬁcult because of his familiarity with
the public.

The ﬁlm, however, is not a tightly
packed work. Director Schatzberg
deviates unnecessarily from the gist of
the story into short supposedly humorous
idiosyncrasies of the men in power.

‘These scenes move away uselessly,

taking attention and importance away
from the theme, and cheapening the ﬁlm,
as if Alda and/ or Schatzberg felt that the
merits of sticking closely to the story line
would not hold the audiences’ attention.
Obviously, one or both men betrayed
their conﬁdence in the material a bit.
Placed in these side tracks is Rip Tom,
who plays a Souther senator with a sexual
overbite and a taste for bourbon and self-
assureness. Torn is ﬁne when his role

stays directly in context with the movie.

But one can’t help watching him and
thinking of a slight overlap with his role
as former President Nixon in the TV
adaptation of John Dean's “Blind
Ambition.” I '

Also, Melvy_n Douglass is excellent in
his protrayal of an aging senator who

- refuses to believe that he might soon have

to retire; a disturbing thought to a man
who has known nothing but politics all his

life. He frequently lapses into babbling
French or seizures of senility. -

Had “Seduction” been done by a
better director it wouldn’t seem to end so
quickly.
family reaches its climax too soon. The
ﬁnal scenes aren’t boring disasters, but
they could have been tightened. The
ending may leave some audiences a bit
restless, bewildered or unsatisﬁed, but
then. again, so does politics.

Not since “The Candidate” and “All,
the Presidients Men” has there been an
admirable political ﬁlm, and for that,
“Seduction” and its cast deserve praise
for doing a ‘highly credible and pleasant
job. Alan Alda is indeed on his way to
establishing himself as an accomplished
screen actor and writer. “The Seduction
of Joe Tynan” is a ﬁne start, and Alda is a
face audiences can be looking forward to
seeing again.

Young’sConcertFootage  

Too Sleepy on Screen

ByMARKHOLAN _ ‘ ‘

Rust Never Sleeps ,
Directed by Bernard Shakey

Neal Young’s movie, “Rust Never
Sleeps,” is 1 hour and 45 minutes of
nothing but straight beginning.-to-end
concert footage ﬁlmed during Young’s
tour with Crazy Horse last fall. The

. concerts, as anyone who attendedwould

surely testify, were quite extraordinary.
The same statement, however, can’t be
made for this ﬁlm.

Watching a concert on screen, as most

concert goers will agree, isn’t as good as --

being , there. The better rock ﬁlms,
“Woodstock,” “Gimme Shelter,” “The
Last Waltz” and most recently, "The

‘ Kids Are Alright,” have all broken up the

on-stage sequences with glimpses of life
backstage and interviews with band
members. This added dimension is what

‘makes these ﬁlms more interesting and

valuable to fans. .

Young and director Shakey, however,
must have felt this was unnecessary.
They must have reasoned that an instant
replay of this bizarre show is all any fan
really needs.

The concerts, like the ﬁlm, began with
several “Roadeyes,” elﬂike characters in
brown hooded robes and huge Day Glo
orange eyes setting up Young’s stage.

‘V While the roadeyes work furiously setting

up the oversized stage, equipment
including a giant microphone, speakers, /a
harmonica and water glass the size of an

oil barrel, Jimi Hendrix’s version of the

“Star Spangled Banner” and the Beatles

“A Day in the Life,” play on the PA.

Young ﬁnally appears sleeping under a
huge crate and begins an acoustic set
which includes “Sugar Mountain,”‘.“I.
Am A Child” and “Comes A Time.” As
usual, Young appears glassy eyed, a frail
looking man with a twisted grin. His
voice and playing, however, are in ﬁne
shape.

Unfortunately, the sound system at the
Kings Court ‘theater robs this saving
quality of the ﬁlm. As for‘the visual
clarity of the ﬁlm itself, it’s easy to see

why no one else making movies these

days is using “Rust-o-Vision.” Each
shot, whether a close-up or long distance,
is hazy and out of focus.

Young ﬁnishes the ﬁrst half of the show
by crawling into the world’s largest
sleeping bag repeating the all important
line from “My, my, Hey, hey (Out of the
Blue): “Rock n’ roll will ‘ never
die....never die....never die....” The
roadeyes reappear and Young is dragged

‘A '_ off stage.

When he reappears, it is with his band
Crazy Horse: Billy Talbot, Ralph Molina
and Frank Sampedro. The electric half of
the show begins. It is undoubtedly the
better half including such songszas “The
Loner,” “Cortez the Killer,” “Cinnamon
Girl,” “Needle and the Damage Done”
and V ‘_ "Welfare. Mothers. ’ ’

“Rust Never Sleeps” is a must for Neal
Young fans, especially those who saw him
during his last tour. For those unfamiliar

_ with_his songs, staging and style, the ﬁlm"

will be boring and bizarre.

In Through the out Dom. where, except into the side’s—ﬁnal song,

The title of Led Zeppelin’s new album,
“In Through the Out Door,” should serve
as a good indication of what direction
England’s legendary quartet is moving
these days—backwards. The band’s
ninth album and ﬁrst studio effort since
“Presence” in March, 1976, “In Through
the Out Door” is another sad collection of
post “Physical Graffiti” Zeppelin tunes.

Recorded and mixed at Polar Music
Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, “In
T hrough, the Out Door” was produced by
Jimmy Page, Zeppelin’s founder and lead
guitarist. Unfortunately, Page seems to
have spent too much ‘time with his
talented ﬁngers working the controls of
the mixing board, instead of the frets on
his Les Paul. The album is overproduced.
Page comes off musically as as mere
session man, rather than the founder of
his own band and one of rock’s premier
guitarists.

Side one of this disappointing disc
begins with “In the Evening.” After a

brief Pink Floyd-like intro, vocalist Robert f

Plant announces the title of the song and
out rocks the music. Plant’s vocals get
lost. in layer upon layer of weak guitar
riffs,'however, and Zeppelin has rocked

' much, better.

“South Bound Saurez” features the
pumping drum work of John Bonham.
Plant’s vocals are clearer but Page's
guitar work remains below average-—

The outdoor. sculptures are essentially
the main draw of the show, although
there are some exciting pieces in the
indoor exhibition. Kenneth Brown’s
“The Boxers” has a comical yet visceral
quality that intimates wonder and
affection. Jerry Caplan’s “Reﬂector
‘Series: Cone” is a slick combination of
technology and aesthetics; a rotating gold
cone reﬂects an ephemeral halo looking
like some space age altar. The most
imaginative piece in the show is Micheal

piece of musical allegory. But, Plant’s
words are so lost under the sound of John
Paul Jones’ keyboards that it is difﬁcult to
understand exactly what the allegory is.
About eight minutes into the track, Jones
surprises the Zeppelin aﬁcionado with a
quasi-disco riff on the synthesizer. Ugh!

“All My Love” features more keyboard
workfrom Jones, making one wonder if

i" there hasn't been a. rider in his contract
~ all these years that said Jones eventually

would get to expose his talentson other
instrumentsbesides the bass guitar. The
album’s ﬁnal song, “I’m Gonna Crawl,”
begins with an absurd symphonic
overture and then launches into Zeppe-
lin’s poorest blues effort to date. There

' are hints of tasteful blues riffs from Page,
. but by this point in the album it is too late
for redemption.

After a two-year absence from the
stage, Led_ Zeppelin headlined two shows
at England’s Knebworth Park on August
4 and 11, playing before a crowd in excess
of 250,000 adamant fans. It must have
been interesting to hear how these new
songs sounded with the band forced to
play‘ them out front without the aid of the
studio mixing board to ﬁll in the sound.

Led ‘Zeppelin has even sunken tothe

are - respectably predictable and only
occasionally lapse into the chronically
‘mediocre or the terminally mundane. A
prime example of the latter is Elvira
Peake’s “Untitled,” a hodgepodge of
clay pots and urns and what looks like
anything else she uncovered in her
studio.

There’s also a particularly dull piece
by Paul O’Hara entitled “Steel and
Wood,” and “Hands of Man” by'Kwasi
Jayowrba is another big disappointment.
Jayowrba’~s combination of the cliche
symbol of the human hands cutout with a

’ grandiose title invokes the image of a

human service logo or a postage stamp
rather than the evocative personal image
one hopes to ﬁnd in contemporary art.
One of the outstanding piecesin the
outdoor show is Edward Eberle’s

performances.

It’s sad indeed to see one of rock's best
bands decline to such sickening studio
drivel. Led Zeppelin celebrates its tenth
anniversary this yearand a comparison to
the first album, “Led Zeppelin I” with
this new release shocks the listener into
realizing what a decade can do to a band.

should have been called “Out Through

near red metal poles that join to point to
the sky--hint at a space found in a croquet
court, exuding a kind of bizarre “Alice in
Wonderland” feeling.

The most controversial piece in the
show is Janet Lewis’s “Time’s Incredibly
Swift Flow," a corny title for an equally
melodramatic interpretation of birth, life
and death through four mummy-like
ﬁgures with overbearing grotesqueness.
Ralph Epstein’s “W.A. Sponner Memor-
ial Part in the Ark” is situated perfectly
on top of a hill where the burlap sides of
its “ark” can ﬂap freely in the wind
reminiscent of Christo’s “Running

demonstrated its impermanence; the
wind has blown part of it over and it looks
like the ark was caught in a 40-day
rainstorm.
