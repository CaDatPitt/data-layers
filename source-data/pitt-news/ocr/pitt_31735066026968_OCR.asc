being denied choice dollars because we serve

The oldest restaurant in Oakland, The
Original Hot Dog Shop, has accusedthe ‘
University of Pittsburgh of practicing dis-

. crimination after its recent decision to deny

them choice dollars.

“We have a chance to compete, andwe
have good food and we’re cheap,” said Sid

Simon, owner of The “O.”

“We want choice dollars for delivery ser-

alcohol, but that’s a lie.”

“That’s just a smoke screen,” Simon said.
He said he would never consider delivering
alcoholic beverages because he‘ realizes he
could lose his liquor license. ' _

“Why are they denying us —— why?” he

said. “I’m not operating an illegal prostitu-

tion ring.”

However, Betsy Sallade-Farina, director of

food services, is upholding the university’s

vice only,” he said. “We were told we were

Greek Week

Peter Knezevich
For The Pitt News

The unofficial kickoff for
Greek Week begins tonight
at Metropol with a benefit
concert.

The concert, which will ‘

benefit’ Family House chari-
ties, is highlighted by three
local bands. D.O.S.E., The
Dirges and Nixon Clocks
will provide alternative rock
with three concerts begin-
ning at 7:30 p.m.

Deanna Angelo, a chair-
person for Greek Week, was
enthusiastic about the con-
cert and Family House char-
ities.

“I expect the turnout to be
excellent,” said Angelo.
“It’s going to be a good time
for a good cause.”

James Saunders, another
chairperson, was confident
the show would sell out.

“We think the show will
definitely sell out,” he said.
“It is an event open to all
students, and the transporta-
tion is free.”

The transportation
Saunders is referring to is
the university shuttles. They
will provide free service to
and from Metropol. The
shuttles will begin running
at 7:30 p.m. and stop run-
ning at 2:00 a.m. -

“If you’re 21 and plan on
drinking you don’t have to
worry about finding a cab,”
said Saunders.

Although alcohol will be
provided, this is an all-ages
event. Anyone wishing to
drink will be carded at the
upstairs bar.

Aside from the singing
and dancing, the main pur-
pose of the event is to bene-
fit Family House. The chari-

Pitt may
lose liver

By Jackie Duggan
Staff Writer

A change in the‘ dis-
tribution of livers for
transplant operations is
threatening Pitt’s repu-
tation as being the
largest liver transplant
center in the country.

“It is [frustrating]

I because it’s not that
the volume (of trans-
plant operations) has
dropped off because
the quality isn’t there
or that there are better
programs,” said Dr.
John Fung, chief of
UPMC’s division of
transplant surgery. “It
has dropped off
because of something
totally out of our con-
trol.”

Fung is referring to

the four-year—old
national liver-alloca-
tion system that gives
preference to patients
in the region where a
liver is donated even if
they are not the sickest
patients.

Before this new allo-
cations system Pitt
Medical Center and
other large "transplant
facilities received most
of the donated organs.
Now smaller ‘ and
newer centers are
awarded more avail-
able livers.

The United Network
for Organ Sharing
(UNOS) enacted the
system in 1991 in
response to doctors

O’Connor

By Mark Gordon
Asst. News Editor

Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor asked the state
Senate for an increase in
funds yesterday, citing'Pitt’s
“public responsibilities” and
the university’s contribution
to Pennsylvania. '

According to a statement
released by University
Relations, if Gov. Torn
Ridge’s budget is enacted the
university will receive a 1.5
percent increase through
Tuition Challenge Grant
funds. ’

O’Connor said because
Pitt’s budget is “predicated
on very modest tuition
increases” there is a need for
an additional 4.5 percent
increase in Pitt’s base appro-
priation. I

O’Connor spoke to the
Pennsylvania Senate
Appropriations Committee
about the pressing need for
Pitt to get more money from
the state.

In the statement released
by Pitt, O’Connor said “the
only increases the
Commonwealth’s public uni-
versities have received in the

requests money from state

past five years have been
awarded through the Tuition
Challenge Grant program.”
O’Connor said that particu-
lar program does not always
recognize differences in

“programmatic cost, institu- »

tional mission and changing
student demographics,” of
the various public universi-
ties in Pennsylvania.

While arguing for the
increase, O’Connor told the
Senate that “Pitt has respond-
ed to the Commonwealth’s
fiscal realities and has
achieved annual and one-

time savings of $17 million.” V

Childhood Sexual Abuse

One change that we
have noted at the counsel-
ing center in recent years
is the increase in the num-
ber of students who report
trauma stemming from
childhood abuse. More
often than not, the abuse

occurs before the victim’s
fifth birthday in 11 per-
cent of the cases and
before the victim’s 10th
birthday in about 50 per-
cent of the cases. Unlike
rape, 65 percent of report-
ed sexual abuse of chil-
dren is non-violent. The
victims are usually
coerced with more subtle

by warnings that to talk
about it will cause great
upset in their families.

Most students who seek
counseling because of the
effects of sexual abuse do
so with great reluctance
due to their feelings of
shame and their belief
that only they have had
this experience. The truth
is that incest alone (apart
from other sexual abuse)
is estimated to affect 12
to 30 percent of all girls
and two to nine percent of
all boys. ,

The research evidence
indicates that this abuse

occur over an extended
period of time and
because the victims may
feel that they were willing
participants.

Studies have shown that
some of the survivors of
childhood sexual abuse
seem to escape without
serious long-term psycho-
logical problems, but for
many there are damaging
effects. A variety of phys-

Pro-liiers
prepare
for busy
weekend

 

By David Palmer
Staff Writer

The Students for Life are
awaiting the arrivalof the
Collegians Activated to
Liberate Life (CALL) for a
weekend of pro-life activism
on April 21-23.

The weekend begins Friday,
April 21 with two speakers at
the Franciscan University of

Steubenville in Ohio. Joan .

Andrews-B ell and John

Cavanaugh-O’Keefe will be

the featured pro-life speakers.
Bell is considered a heroine
of the pro-life movement.
This mother of two spent
nearly two-and-a-half years in
solitary confinement in a
Florida prison for
involvement in pro-life
demonstrations. She has also
written several books dis-
cussing the issues involving
the pro-life movement.
Cavanaugh-O’Keefe has
been called the “father of the
rescue movement.” He found-
ed the Pro-Life Non-Violence
Project, a non-violent activist
group which participates in
activities such as sitting in
front of abortion clinic doors.
Saturday, April 22 the
CALL activists will arrive at
the Pitt campus to begin their
weekend of activism. The
activities will include passing
out leaflets throughout the
campus and picketing several
local_abortion clinics and out-

side the home of a local abor- '

tion doctor, who has not yet
been determined.

“There will be college stu-
dents coming from several
states helping to spread
awareness throughout the Pitt
campus and the city of
Pittsburgh,” said Stephany
Pritchett, the president of
Students for Life.

CALL activists are college
students who have taken a
year off school to participate
in the program. This group
ranges from the Midwest and
spans throughout the East.
Beth Schrift, a former Pitt
student, is a current CALL
member who will participate
in the activities weekend.

“CALL visits college cam-
puses throughout the nation
to spread awareness and
encourage activism,” said
Pritchett.

While students’ housing
complaints of deadbeat land-
lords and lack of security
appear to be nothing out of
the ordinary around the Pitt
campus, the trend is not lim-
ited to this area.

An informal survey sent to
six urban universities
revealed similar housing
problems at other schools.

Participants V included
Syracuse University, Boston
College, Penn State,
Columbia University, the
University of Texas and
Michigan State.

The survey inquired about
available housing off and on-
campus, rates, shuttle and
escort services, serious

crimes and common housing

complaints.

Landlord complaints, top-
ping the list of housing prob-
lems, tend to. be about deteri-
orating conditions in the
buildings, failure to return
security deposits and lack of
response to tenants’ com-
plaints. .

At Syracuse University, a
school with a total student
population of 14,000, all stu-
dents are required to live
on—campus for the first two
years.

Although there are many
complaints from students
who move out of the dorms,

it is still done frequently

because it is usually cheaper,
said Syracuse senior Marc
Bailes.

“Most [landlords] keep
security deposits, and are
very unresponsive to tenant
complaints,” Bailes said.

At MSU, which has a total

population of 40,000, com-
plaints are fairly similar to
Pitt. 1

“At Michigan State
University it’s cheaper to
live off-campus than it is to
live in the dorms,” said
Jennifer Golec, a sophomore
at MSU. “From the begin-
ning of this semester to pre-
sent, we’ve lost over 1,000
students [to off-campus
housing.]”

According to'Golec, stu-
dents complain about access
to parking andlimited shut-
tle service, especially to the

.commuter lots.

While all of the schools
surveyed offer shuttles to
students living off-campus,
the satisfaction with the sys-
tems vary. -

Students at the University
of Texas are offered 14 dif-
ferent shuttle services from
the UT campus area as well

as free fares on the Austin
city buses. ,

On Syracuse’s campus,
students can ride on the
Centro bus system free of
charge. “The problem is that
after midnight or so, the
buses do not run frequently,”
Bailes said. “And [they] are
not always convenient in
terms of time and location.”

The cost of living off-cam-
pus varies among the schools
as well.

The average rent for a one-

Syracuse University and
Michigan State is around
$280 per month. Students at

Boston College pay about .

Piﬂ Dental Clin

By Matt Fentress
Staff Writer

The fear of the drill can be a tough
one to overcome, but a group of doc-
tors at Pitt’s dental school is helping
some patients to make it easier.

The Dental Fears Clinic, run
through the University of Pittsburgh
School of Dental Medicine, has
treated close to 100 patients for vari-
ous dental phobias since l988, said
clinic director Dr. Calvin Pierce.

Serious dental phobia affects six to
12 percent of the population, said
Pierce, a figure which translates to
80,000 to 200,000 for the Pittsburgh
area.

“Anything that you could imagine,
we would be seeing here,” said
Pierce. One type of patient the clinic
might treat is needle phobics,
patients who are afraid of a needle
being placed in or near their mouth.
To treat this phobia, Pierce said, an
intravenous injection might be used
to anesthetize the patients.

“A lot of [the treatment] is pretty
straight forward, not really probing
deep into their minds,” said Dr. Eric
Kern of the dental school.

Other patients may have a phobia
of the waiting room, closed spaces,
or catching a disease when they go
to the dentist. At the clinic, these
patients might be encouraged to

The Pitt News, Wednesday, March 29, 1995

inspect the instruments and c_heck
the equipment to help put them at
ease.

“The majority of people we see are
normal people on the street who just
have this one fear,” said Pierce.

The clinic often treats patients
using progressive muscle relaxation
techniques while the patient is seated
in the dental chair. “That proves to
them that they can at least relax in a
dental chair, maybe for the first time
in their life,” said Pierce.

Hypnosis techniques are also used,
as patients are encouraged to think of
a scene or to bring in a picture that
makes them feel happy, said Kern.

Meetings for the project began in

ic helps relieve patients‘ fears of the drill

1986, when the dental school pulled
together enough interested persons.
Doctors from the dental school then
visited dental fears clinics all over
the world to help them assess what
was currently being done at similar
establishments. Dr. Robert
Eigenbrode, one of the founding
members of the university’s clinic,
visited the dental fears clinic in
Gothenberg, Sweden, the oldest in
the world.

The Dental Fears Clinic is part of
University Dental Associates, the
faculty practice of the Pitt dental
school. The practice is in the process
of changing its name to University

alcohol to have choice dollars.
“He asked to become a choice vendor in July,”
Sallade—Farina said. She said at that time he was
V told he would be unable to obtain it because of the
selling of alcohol. “Then he called and suggested
he only do it with his delivery service, which
would preclude him from selling alcohol.”
Sallade—Farina said that policy would not work.’
“Once you have the equipment in your store, we
cannot monitor whether they are doing it just for
delivery or are also using it for counter service,”
she said.
She said Miami Subs dropped their liquor
license to get choice dollars and have since been

very successful.

“We are certainly not discriminating against
him,” she said. She said there is a form letter that
is distributed to any vendor who serves alcohol
and applies for choice dollars explaining the uni-
versity’s position.

She also said parents of incoming students are
informed about choice dollars and are assured that
their children will not be able to purchase alco-
holic beverages through the use of it.

“Students should have a right to buy anywhere
they want to buy,” said Simon. “Not what the
University of Pittsburgh wants them to use.”

“The Original is the safest place in Oakland,” he
said. “We card more people than any other place

in Oakland. We have Pittsburgh Police working
here seven days a week.”

“What did we ever do to the University of
Pittsburgh?” he said.

“Somebody at the University of Pittsburgh doesn’t
like The Original.”

Julie Crowell, president of Student Government
Board, said she thinks The “O” would have a bet-
ter chance of obtaining choice dollars if they were
to drop their liquor license.

“Honestly, right now, I don’t think the food ser-
vice would enter into an agreement with a vendor
who sold alcoholic beverages even if the students
wanted it,” she said. “To be realistic, I don’t even

centers who said the expense and
survival chances for a patient
should also be weighed in deciding
who gets a liver.

According to UNOS, patient sur-
vival rates are greater for patients
who are not hospital-bound or in
intensive care at the time of their
transplants. Since Pitt is the largest
transplant facility they attract more
high-risk operation patients. Many

of these patients are now on a long-

waiting list.

But when it comes to patient sur-
vival rates, the basis for the newer
allocations system is contradictory.

The most recent UNOS liver
transplant survival report indicated
that UPMC exceeded both national
patient survival rates, especially at
a center where high-risk factors are
associated with its patient opera-
tions. ..

The one-year liver transplant
patient survival rate at UPMC was
78.5 percent, compared to the 76.7
percent national rate and the 74.1
percent rate that would be expected
given the complicated cases at the
center.

The two—year survival rate was
73.8 percent, higher than the 68.7
percent expected and the national
rate of 71.8 percent.

Doctors at smaller transplant
centers believe returning to the old
allocations system, as Pitt has pro-
posed, would be extremely costly.

unless The “O” forfeits their
liquor license, their chances
are slim.

“If he met all the other cri-
teria, I think we would cer-
tainly consider it,” she said.
“I don’t see why we would
refuse him.” .

She says the other criteria
entail an initial inspection of
the establishment, as well as
weekly quality checks on
them.

Post-Gazette Andrew Klein, a
transplant surgeon at Johns
Hopkins University Medical
Center, said, “I don’t see how you
could argue the fact that it’s cer-
tainly much more expensive to
transplant the critically ill than
someone not in .a hospital and
[who] will make a rapid recovery
at minimal cost.”-

The question is, why is UNOS
listening to the smaller transplant
facilities?

The answer is because doctors at
smaller centers makeup most of
UNOS’ membership, and the allo-
cations system is based on one vote
per center.

“Out of 100 liver transplant cen-
ters we only get one vote,” said Dr.
Fung. “If it was a vote in propor-
tion to the number of transplants
you perform we would have a
much better voice.”

Pitt has performed more than
4,000 liver transplants since the
program began in 1980.

Dr. Fung said it is very easy to
get outvoted at any level because
thesmaller programs outnumber
the larger ones about 3 to 1.

“They will always have com-
mand of the policies written by
UNOS,” he said.

As things stand, Pitt only per-_

formed 270 transplants in 1993,
compared to 600 in 1990. Dr. Fung
said the current organ laws are
helpful to the centers but not indi-
vidual patients.

“Some families have been there for
so long,” said chairperson Paul Dunn.
“And every year Family House has
been building up a deficit. Greek Week
will help reduce this deficit.”

Among the various Greek Week
activities, tonight’s concert is easily
the most accessible to Pitt students.
Free transportation, three great local
bands and the Metropol dance floor
(smoke and all) should entertain
all facets of the Pitt student popula-
tion.

Officially, Greek Week kicks off on

Thursday with Opening Ceremonies.
Guest speakers include Chancellor J.
Dennis O’Connor and Pat Siger, exec-
utive director of Family House. A
blood drive, which began on Monday,
Greek Sing and a 5Krun/3Kwalk will
highlight the rest of this week’s
events.

“Greek week is for fun, people com-

Angelo. “We’re trying to make things
more interesting, we want more social
events.”

Students wishing to attend tonight’s
concert can pick up tickets in the

develop immediately after the abuse or
years later. Reactions may include
anxiety, fear, depression, problems
with later sexual functioning and
inability to establish satisfying inti-
mate relationships. Occasionally the

after-effects of sexual abuse can con- '

tribute to problems such as eating dis-
orders and substance abuse.

A variety of treatment approaches
have been used successfully with adult
victims of childhood sexual abuse. In
the treatment the client and therapist
work together to address the sur-

vivor’s feelings of anxiety, anger,
guilt, shame and sadness. Some people
choose to work through their problems

in a support group with other people

who have been sexually abused.

Survivors of childhood sexual abuse
need to know that assistance is avail-
able. Confidential assistance is avail-
able at the following agencies:

Direct Loans needed

Part of the Contract for America is to balance the budget
and pay for tax breaks by cutting student aid programs.
Republican members of the House of Representatives say
their .proposals will cut bureaucracy and save money for the
American people. Yet, when presented with a viable option
which would accomplish the same goals without destroying
this country’s future, they move to prevent that as well. The
Republican majority is acting out of partisan interest and not
in the best interest of this country.

Not only do the Republicans want to cut Stafford Loans,
Work-Study Programs, Supplemental Education Opportunity
Grants and Perkins Loans, but they also want to end the
Direct Loan Program. The Direct Loan Program allows stu-
dents to borrow money directly from the Federal Government

to finance their education. The government raises the loan v

money through regular Treasury Bill auctions. Students com-
plete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, the school
determines how much the student will need to borrow, and
then the information is sent ‘to the Department of Education
electronically. When the loan is approved, the student signs
for it, and the money is electronically transferred to the
school. '
Schools should be taking advantage of this opportunity to
simplify paying tuition for both themselves and their students.
Education is a vitally important commodity in the new global
economy. Since the future of this country rests on having a
properly trained work force, the availability and ease of a col-
lege education must be increased for all.
- The Congress should not try to destroy this opportunity for
the students of this country. Direct Loans provide a way to
save the taxpayers money because layers of bureaucracy are
cut out by the use of technology. In addition, with the repay-
ment methods for direct loans as ﬂexible as they are, fewer
loans will be defaulted. According to the Department of
Education, by the year 2000, $6.8 billion dollars will be
saved. ,
There are already 104 colleges involved in the Direct Loan
' Program. The administration of these schools laud its advan-
tages over the current system. As things stand now there are
over 7,000 lenders. Otto Reyer, assistant vice chancellor at the
University of California, said that the program allowed his
staff to “give one-on-one service to students to solve their
problems immediately. There’s no more waiting for checks or
tracking down checks with 101 different lenders.”
Information on the Direct Loan Program is available from
the Department of Education directly by calling 1-800-
4FEDAID. Call the Financial ‘Aid Office to encourage Pitt to
get involved. In addition, let Congress and the President know
thatyou oppose cuts in educational funds- The advantages
outweigh the drawbacks and the benefits for the country as a
whole are too great to be ignored.

Perceptions of feminism not inclusive

eal women don’t
shave their legs, wear
a bra or liketmen.

They have come to the con-
clusion that the male-domi-
nated cultures of the world
are worthy of total destruc-
tion. Guns, war, murder and
all the world’s unpleasant-
ness are direct results of the
male gender’s system of
dominance. The penis inher-
ently damns its bearer to a
life of bigotry and intoler-
ance._ Women who under-
stand this, who refute the tra-
ditions and refuse to cater to
masculine authority and
expectations, are the true,
liberated women of our time.
This is the feminist stereo-
type. No wonder so. many
women flee from any men-
tion of feminism. Some
women are happy with the
description, -but it does not fit
the vast majority of the
female population. Most

-women are “ordinary” people

and live “ordinary” lives, but
they are definitely real
women.

I am a feminist, but I am
disgusted by the dictates of a
movement that is succeeding

. in the alienation of precisely

those whom it is trying to
help. In past years there has
been a tendency to judge tra-
ditional feminine qualities in
a negative fashion. There
appears to be the thought that
if it is traditional, then it was
imposed by men and hence
should be avoided.

Certainly, men have histor-
ically shaped various concep-

tions of what it means to be 8

feminine. Some ideas are
outdated and deserve rethink-
ing. A woman who works is
no less of a woman. Females
are not merely baby—creating
machines. There is life
beyond the June Cleaver
ideal of domesticity.

It is a dangerous assump-
tion, however, to say that
since women now realize that
they need not conform to tra-
ditional societal roles that
they must totally discard

them and run blindly in the
opposite direction. All
options are now open, but the
choice of how to live one’s
life should be made wisely.
One should not merely listen
to those who would claim to
hold the key to being a com-
plete, modern, liberated
woman. Authentic liberation
involves the ability to decide
for oneself what to believe
and how to live.

Ferhinism’s objective is to

fight 5‘the narrow-minded,“

tunnel-vision, masculine con-
ceptions of domesticity and
womanhood induced by cen-
turies of repression resulting
from autocratic, patriarchal,
monotheistic society.” At
least, that is how people per-
ceive the movement. I did
not fabricate that quote, for
it’s a conception that is com-
monly held, although perhaps
more loquaciously stated in
this instance.

Feminism is only hurting
itself through such negative
portrayals. Men feel blamed,

_ and theyiggnse that their best

' effortstoward sensitivity are

being ignored. Women, on
the other hand, don’t always
want to associate themselves
with such drastic departures
from tradition. History is not
all bad, and women some-
times simply want to contin-
ue living in a way that feels
natural and comfortable. To
say that this is wrong is to
impose yet another ideal of
womanhood upon females.

If one wants to pursue an
untraditional feminine
lifestyle, that is perfectly
acceptable. Conversely, how-
ever, if one chooses to live
proverbially barefoot and
pregnant, that is equally
valid. What is of importance
is the aspect of choice.

Make-up, kitchens and
babies do not in and of them-
selves have any power to
subjugate anyone. A woman
is subjugated if something is
forced upon her, if she has no
option of choice.

Some feminists see the

refusal to accept standards of
femininity as proof of libera-
tion. This is incomplete.
Refusal or acceptance is not
nearly as important as a clear
comprehension of one’s true
desires and goals.

For some women, a family I

is their greatest source of
happiness, and they feel no
need to achieve much beyond
success in this area. Why is
an interest and talent in
domestic affairs suddenly
such a horrible concept?

Individuals differ. Some are

more interested in the
humanities than the sciences;
some are more interested in a
family than a career.
Feminism should not be
exclusive and unaccepting,
for that refutes its basis for
legitimacy.

There is still a need for
feminism. There continues to
be problems within our soci-
ety, regardless of laws and
enforced equality.
Regulations cannot change
stagnant mindsets that quick-
ly. Women who are unaware
that their life can be different
or who are forcibly kept
down or humiliated need
support and help.

Homemakers, careerists,
lesbians,
working mothers, conserva-
tives, liberals —— all are
women who can be consid-
ered true feminists, if they
have consciously decided
that their lifestyle is the way
that they want to live, the
way that will afford them
happiness and fulfillment. No
one who blindly follows
standards of femininity can
be considered a feminist,
however, regardless of what
those standards are. When
men and women alike can
accept the various roles that
women can fulfill, femi-
nism’s goal will be achieved.
Liberation is the freedom to
express one’s femininity in
an infinite variety of ways.

Rebecca Briggs is proud to
be a feminist.

Houston
Oiler Al Del
Greco
turned down
a $450,000
offer to kick
for the
Steelers this
season. My initial thought
was, who cares? '

But then I sat back and
thought about it for a sec-
ond, and realized that I have
a real problem with kickers,
whether they be for the
Steelers or anyone else.

Let’s face it, these guys
are bums, plain and simple.
Del Greco is the epitomy of
what they stand for. He’s
short, plump, slow, out of
shape and hasn’t hit a big
kick in his career (remem-
ber the last-second potential
game-winner that he hooked
against the Steelers a few
years ago?)

What compounds these
dreadful characteristics is
that kickers are also greedy.
It’s hard to imagine getting
paid a half million a year to
play about five minutes a
game, maybe make a tackle
once in a while and practice
for a grand total of 25 hours
a season while the rest of
the team is busting their
butts day in and day out.

But it gets even uglier
when you realize how
important kickers are to a
team like the Steelers, who
are not known for their
high-octane offense. During
one of the frequent touch-
down droughts that the team
endured last season, field
goals were the lifeblood of
the offense. It’s hard to
imagine a season without
the dependable services of
Gary Anderson.

But life without Anderson
may soon be a harsh reality
for Steeler fans. He simply
wants too much money. As
usual, the Steelers don’t
want to pay him and this
time, he may be gone for ,
_good. It’s sad because Ijust
can’t see a retread replace-
ment like Dean Biasucci
suiting up in the black and
gold. It’s even harder to
imagine one of these
retreads coming through in
the clutch like Anderson has
so many times in the past.

Men's gymnastics I

By Brad Isles
Staff Writer

On March 18, 1995, the
all-time winningest coach in

"Pitt gymnastics history,

Frank D’Amico, reached
another milestone.

“I don’t know what it is
about 200, maybe it’s
because it’s a round num-
ber,” said D’Amico, whose
career record at Pitt now
stands at 200-107 and 19-8
for the season.

“I still remember how
excited I was" when I looked
at the score and I saw the
score on the flashers,” he
said. “I sent somebody to
check it, but they said it was
good.”

Pitt finished second at the
meet with a final score of
216.05, behind host Temple,
who posted a formidable
227.15. Finishing a close
third was Navy at 215.75
and last was Radford
(165.65). ,

The key was Pitt’s final
event, the parallel bars,
which it came into trailing
Navy by a point. Keith
Youndt placed third with a
9.4 and Jason Lannie and
Andy Anderson tied for
eighth with 9.05, helping the
blue and gold post their
highest team score of the
day, a 36.45. A

“I knew how close it was
between us and Navy,” said
D’Amico, “We hit our last

season. Because of a learning
disability, Pitt is trying to get
Cummings a “special test,”
which is either an untimed test
or read to him.

Regardless if Cummings
passes, he’s a “partial qualifi-
er,” which means he has the
minimum grade point average.
This means he can attend Pitt

and practice with the team, but
would have to pay his own
way. Consequently, he would
lose a year of eligibility.

Cummings is ranked as a top
10 guard in the country and a
top 30 prospect overall.

A abamo
Relays

By Diavail Smith
S_ta[f Writer

Najuma Fletcher handed out
more pink slips to competition
as she broke her personal
meet record in the heptathlon
to lead the wave of qualiﬁers
for the Panthers’ last weekend
at the Alabama Relays.

“They rocked it out,” said
coach Steve Lewis. “We’re
taking the same approach as
we did during the indoor sea-
son, and that’s to prepare for
the conference champi-
onships.”

Fletcher showed the compe-
tition who was running things
in the heptathlon, which
includes eight events: the long
jump, high jump, 100-meter
hurdles, 200-meter dash, 800-
meter run, shot-put and the
javelin, as she won the event
with 5,749 points.

She also qualified for the

Freshman of the Year

Chad Jesko, wrestling
in the l26—pound weight
class,
Eastern Wrestling
League’s Freshman of
the Year yesterday.

His 25 victories is the
third-highest total ever
by a Pitt freshman.
Additionally, Jesko is
only the second Panther
to win the award in the
16-year history of the
league (Doug Haines
won in 1984).

“Chad had a very good
first season at this level,”
coach Rande Stottlemyer
said. “He was 25-13
overall and it was against
some stiff competition.”

Jesko finished third in
victories for Pitt, tied for
first in major decisions

was named the.

(six) and tied for third in
tournament wins (10).

Jesko finished fourth in
the EWL Tournament,
good enough to be cho-
sen as an alternate for
the NCAA
Championships.

He . was called into
action after teammate
Brett Gould injured his
knee, and defeated an
eighth-seeded wrest_ler in
the first round.

“He’s a dedicated
young man with an
except-ional work ethic,”
Stottlemyer said. “We
believe he’s got avshot to
become an outstanding
wrestler in a year or
two.”

Center Jaime Peterson's career
at Pitt yet to be completed

By Sean Duncan
Sports Editor

Pitt’s basketball season
may be over, but Jaime
Peterson isn’t done quite
yet.

After

taking the

Big East

by sur-

prise, the

6-foot-9

c e n t e r

continues

to shock non-believers.

Peterson was selected to

two prestigious All-Star
games yesterday.

The New York City
native was one of 20 of the
top senior players in the
country selected by college
coaches to play in the

National Association of
Basketball Coaches
(NABC) All—America
game. The game will be
held on Sunday, April 2, at
the University of
Washington in conjunction
with the Final Four.

Peterson was also chosen
to play in the NBA pre-
draft All-Star games in
Portsmouth, Va., from
April 5-8. The games are
invitation only for the top
NBA-eligible players.

“Jaime Peterson had an
outstanding year in both
defensive and offensive
aspects of the game,” coach
Ralph Willard said. “He
was definitely one of the
top two most improved
players in the country this
past season.”

Peterson led Pitt this sea-
son in five categories. He
led in scoring with 13.9
points a game, rebounding
(9.4), blocked shots with
70, steals (50) and field
goal percentage (.513).

This from a player who
averaged just under 13
minutes a game the previ-
ous season. Perhaps
Peterson’s biggest sign of
improvement was from the
free-throw line. He
improved his .586 percent-
age in 1993-94, to .755 this
season. '

Big East coaches took
notice of Peterson’s play,
as he was voted second-
team All-Big East. He was
also voted first—team All-
Big East by Basketball
Weekly.

stock continues to rise. He’s

been cited as the 32nd best.

player in thecountry.

“He’s one of those kids
who’s a late bloomer,” Cleary
said. “He was labeled early,
and to his credit has improved
alot.

Cleary said that Gill could
step in and make an impact
right away.

“He’s a_very intellectual
player,” he said. “He’s a guy
who might adjust to the col-
lege game a little quicker.”

Rounding out the class is
Howard, a 6-8 athletic forward
from Philadelphia. Howard,
who just turned 17, is a good
rebounder, which is vital since
Pitt lost its starting frontline
due to graduation. Cleary said
that doctors think Howard
could still be growing.

Willard still has one scholar-
ship to fill, and is looking for
for a big-man. In the early
signing period, Pitt has

received high marks for its ‘

incoming class. ESPN ranked
Pitt as the fourth best class in
the nation and USA Today has
the Panthers second.

Kellii Taylor, who commit-
ted to Pitt last year but failed
his entrance exams, currently
is playing at a prep school in
Maine. Since Taylor hasn’t
signed his binding letter-of-
intent, Cleary was unable to
talk about his status. However,
Taylor has already verbally
committed to Pitt.

Last year Taylor was rated
as one of the best guards in the
country.

’ National Championships.

And if that isn’t enough,
Fletcher also qualified for the
NCAA Championships in the
long jump, high jump and
100-meter hurdles.

Although Megan Ferrara
finished in 11th place in the
heptathlon, she did manage to
qualify for the Eastern
Collegiate Athletic Conference
championships (4,218).

Fletcher also had time to
deliver one last pink slip as

. she helped the Panthers’ tag

team of Joetta Purter, Staci
Suggs and Shanna Fadis win
the 4 x 100 shuttle hurdle relay
(57.71).

The 4 x 800 relay tag team
of Anna Kohler, Lakeya
Smith, Natasha Van Reil and
Angie Martin hit a winning
time of 9:02.13 seconds.

Team scoring was kept for
relay events only, as the
women scored a total of 33
points to earn a third-place fin-
ish behind Louisiana State and
Alabama, respectively, in team
competition.

In individual competition,
the Panthers had five ECAC
qualifiers in the 400-interrne-
diate hurdles. Joetta Purter led
the group with a second-place

finish, hitting a time of 60.76 0

seconds. Angie Martin was
right behind Purter in third,
hitting a time of 60.85 sec-

onds. Lakeya Smith took fifth
(61.79) in the event. Also,
Zenia Ayrton took sixth
(61.94) and Shanna Fadis took
eighth to round out the quali-
fiers for Pitt.

On the men’s side, the relay
teams took first place in team
competition, earning 38 points
to finish ahead of Louisiana
State and Alabama.

The 4 x 110 shuttle tag team
of Curtis Anderson, Wes
Alexander, Jonathan Dixon
and Jay Murphy did some

work hitting their winning _

time of 57.46 seconds.

The men had three Inter-
Collegiate Association of
Amateur Athletes of America
qualifiers.

Jay Jones and Dietrich Jells
qualified in the 100—meters,
both nailing a ninth-place time
of 10.58 seconds.

Anthony Dorsett also quali-
fied in the event by hitting a
time of 10.71 seconds. ._

And yet another Panther
qualified for the IC4As, as Jay
Murphy did in the 110-meter
hurdles, taking fifth place.

Frank Nesko earned a
fourth-place finish in the
5,000-meter run.

The Panthers will be in
sunny Florida next weekend to
participate in the Gatorade
Classic at the University of
Miami.

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH
NOW PRACTICIN G DISCRIMINATION
AGAINST SOME BUSINESSES IN I

OAKLAND...

The University of Pittsburgh is’ state and federally
subsidized, and is now. practicing discrimination. The
Original Hot Dog Shop has applied for choice dollars and has
been denied. The Original Hot Dog Shop is the oldest
restaurant in Oakland, having been there for 36 years.
Recently a new restaurantwas opened, and they were given
choice dollars right away. The party that owns the restaurant
includes a member of city council. Does‘ that tell you
anything? The Original Hot Dog Shop is a landmark in the
city of Pittsburgh. We have complied with all rules and
regulations and we have still been denied choice dollars. We
appeal our case to students, doctors, the board directors, and
the professors of the University of Pittsburgh. Question:
What do the University of Pittsburgh law students think of
this one?...

On floor it was the Owls’
Kenny Sykes (9.75) who
took first and his teammate
Darin Gerlach tied with
Navy’s Bo Hanle for second
at 9.70. Pitt’s Karl Chan

was eighth at 9.25 and -

Jason Lannie rounded out
the top ten with a 9.05.

The Owls swept the top
three spots on both pommel
horse and high bar. On
horse, Sykes and Danny
Ackerman tied for first at
9.65 and Jason Rushton was
third with 9.45. Youndt took
sixth for the Panthers with
9.25.

Then on the bar it was
Gerlach (9.55), Bader
(9.50) and Carl Imhauser
placing one, two and three
respectively. For the
Panthers, Chris Sweeten
was sixth with a 9.30 and
Chan and Lannie tied for
eighth at 9.2.

On rings, Temple’s Frank
scored 9.75 to edge out
teammate Dubie Bader
(9.65) for the top spot.
Navy’s Matt Tucker was a
close third at 9.60. Youndt
(9.5) placed sixth and
Lannie eighth at 9.3 for Pitt.

Lannie remained consis-
tent for the Panthers, finish-
ing second in the all-
around, with a mark of
54.4. He finished two points
behind Temple’s Akerman
(56.4).

Finally, on vault, Gerlach
was first for Temple at 9.35

and Ackerman was second.

with 9.20. Navy’s Kevin
Bauer was third with 9.15.
Pitt’s Youndt was fourth,
posting a 9.1.

The.twowins over Navy
and Radford came as a sur-
prise to D’Amico, while
Temple was just too much
to handle.

“I didn’t expect to win
there,” he said. “I didn’t
think we could. Our guys
hit their sets, but the judg-
ing was very difficult.

“It was good for the
guys,” D’Amico added.
“They were a little disap-
pointed because our score
wasn’t very high. [The
judges] took off every
tenth, every little bit they
were hammering us and we
had some good sets.”

D’Amico and the team
will now look to add to
their record this weekend at
