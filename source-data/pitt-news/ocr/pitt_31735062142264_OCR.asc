rousing cheers, the students will hear members of the foot-
ball team and the coaching staff.

In case of bad weather,

the rally will be held in the

Geise Opens Special School

Students Will Be T.-...=..ed
For Pitt Civilian Defense _

_Pitt’s air-raid defense organization, rapidly increasing in
efficiency, this semester will institute a civilian defense train-
mg school for students to supplement the various courses

given during the summer for in-
dividuals from the faculty and ad-
ministration.

_ The new training school will
train student volunteers as air-raid
wardens, ﬁre watchers, messengers,
bomb squads, and decontamina-
tion squads, according to Dr. John
J. Geise, associate professor of
history and chief air raid warden.

« The school is designed to pro-

vide the various services of the ~

organization with adequate per-
sonnel. Already, each of tthe

Lantern Night

Lantern Night has been a tradi-
tion at Pitt since 1914. Tomorrow
night at 7 o’clock freshman wom-
en will be introduced to that tra-
dition.

There will be one slight change
in the usual ritual, Rica Spiegel,
chairman of traditions committee,
announces. This year, early Ameri-
can lanterns will be used instead
of Japanese lanterns.

The idea behind the ceremony
will be the same. It is intended to
create the desire for knowledge

and wisdom, and formally in-
ducts freshman women into the
life of women at the University.

Miss Spiegel will open the pro-
gram with a Welcome address to
the freshmen. This will be follow-
ed with speeches by Mary Ruth
Hosey, senior queen of 1941; Ruth
Cox, C43, as Father Pitt, and
Nancy Crawford, C42, as Alma
Mater. , ’

Aids of Alma Mater are to be
Truth, Jean Brink, C42; Valor,
Elinor Barbrow, C42; Mercy, Al-
ma Nicholas, Ed43; and Justice,
Evelyn Clements, C43.

Eighty members of the junior
class, the big-sister class, will pre-
sent the “Dance of the Lanterns,”
and the senior mentors will accom-
pany the freshmen girls.

vice, and the campus itself is
patrolled during alerts by air
raid wardens belonging to the
University _ post. _

All of the University buildings
are tied into a telephone air raid
warning system which is now on
a 24 hour schedule. A ﬁre watch-
er’s station is being organized and
equipped on the roof of the Ca-
thedral. ' A

To pr.ovide these services with
adequate personnel, plans have
been made to start a group of 150

students in these ﬁelds every six ‘

weeks. ,

All members of each group

will stay together for the gen-
~ eral course and the course in

gas defense. Thereafter, they

will be divided into smaller units

for the special work required ‘of
' the different services. .

The ﬁrst group of 150 volun-
teers will start work on Tuesday,
October 6. Applfcations for admis-
sion should be made at the ofﬁce
of the University air raid warden,
2002 Cathedral, as soon as pos-
sible. ,

To obtain. accurate information
regarding the preparation, ser-
vices, and interests of the Univer-
sity’s students and faculty in ci-
vilian defense, a questionnaire has
been distributed to some of the
students, and will be circulated
among the faculty and administra-
tive groups.

Results of this questionnaire‘
will be published in the Pitt
News when the results have been
tabulated.

“These services may help pre-
pare Pitt to meet the demands for
services to civilian defense that
will surely be made more and more
as time goes on,” Dr. Geise ‘stated.

For Students‘
Hospitalization

Dr. Auleen W. Jamison, direct-
or of the Student Health service
for women, and Dr. H. C.\Carlson,
director of the Student Health ser-
vice for men, ‘announce that the
dues for the Hospitalization plan,
should be payed as soon as pos-
sible, since the plan does not go
into effect until payment.

Under the new tri-semester plan.
the charge for a semester is $2.25,
payable at the Treasurer’s office,
2409 Cathedral, before October 10.

The plan makes available to
the student, room and board in
ward accommodations for 21
days of the school year, or an al-
lowance of $3.00 per day toward
private or semi-private accom-
modations. .

Also available are the use of op-
erating room, anaesthesia, drugs
and medications, dressings or casts,

- laboratory and X-Ray service.

Students may register for the
plan at the Women’s Health ser-
vice, 28th ﬂoor; Cathedral, or at
the Men’s Health service, 34th
ﬂoor, Cathedral.

All out-of-town women students
living at sorority houses, or hous-
es under University jurisdiction,

Book Exchange
Open All Week

Men’s Council book exchange is
open again this semester for the
beneﬁt of students who wish to
buy and sell used books. It will be
kept open from 10:30 to. 2:30
o’clock in 832 Cathedral this en-
tire week. _

Students who wish to sell books
should bring them to the book ex-
change as soon as possible, and
not wait to hear what books are
most frequently asked for. A

The price of the books to be sold
are set by the owners, usually
two-thirds of new book value. The
book exchange deducts ﬁfteen per
cent of this amount for its ser-
vice, and adds this amount to the
student loan fund maintained by
Men’s Council.

the papers said, be called to_.sers-
vice upon reaching draft age,
which, now 20 years, will probably.»-.
be lowered shortly to 19 or to .1 ‘
The newspaper statement, was.
wrong because: Q

1. There is no indication that’
the Army will call to activ 9
duty AERC men, during thi
present semester even if the
should reach draft age. 1

2. In future semesters that same,-
principle will apply—that is, you
get to ﬁnish the semester duringﬂl‘
which you reach draft age. _ V 

3. (And this is most important.
It is now planned that draft ago
will be interpreted at the equiv-'*
alent age at which a man would it
otherwise be inducted through se-
lective service-——approximately ' 20.“,
years and six months. p

In other words, it will be pos-
sible to ﬁnish the semester during
which you became 20 years and,
six months old, if you are a mem-
ber of the AERC. If not, you 'ar,o';
liable to a selective service call,
just‘ as is any other draft regis-
trant.

The University acceleration pro-

degrees on September 16 in the}
fourth commencement of the year.
In addition four students receiv-
ed the degree of Bachelor of Laws.’

Those students, who received‘
their diplomas by mail, would nor-
mally have completed their college
work in February, 1943; but by at-
tending the accelerated summer
session they were ready to aid
the war effort six months early. 1

Women is Army Auxiliary Corps Claims :
Many University Women Graduates

Pitt has always had its share
‘of glamor girls. It is quite natural,

then, that in 1942 when a new

type of girl has taken the spot-
light from the Lana Turners and
I-Iedy LaMarrs that Pitt should
have its share of this type of girl,-—

the girl in uniform. And Pitt does
have a lot of women in uniform
who are serving in different branch-
es of the army or navy. '

The WAACS have claimed the
largest representation from Pitt
to date. These, ‘girls are either

they were both willing . . .

This is youth’s message to the
world. It was written and adopted
at the International Student As-

sembly, a conference of 350 stu-

dents from the 29 United Nations,

held early this month at Washing-

ton.

We urge that /you read this
credo, think about it, discuss it
with your fellow students. For it
‘represents »a crystallization of
what a oross—section of the stu-
dents of the world think about the

fwar, the peace, the future. You,
»,likeu‘ise students of the world,
_-must realize, as did the assembly

delegates, that arms and muni-
tIi()'n.s are . not in themselvces
an/Juigh for ultimate victory.
There must be a strengthening
of the ideological forces at work

. among the United Nations——forces

of unity, of progress, of social
welfare, of international solidar-
itrn.

STATESMAN .11-’.,ea.m’

In short it is just ‘as important
that we know‘ why we’re ﬁght-
ing as it is to realize that we must
fight. This credo helps answer that
question.

As snchit is a distinct and im-
portant weapon .for victory.

We, the students of many lands,
diverse races, cultures and relig-
ions, assembled at this critical
hour from the battlefronts of the
world, meet to consider’ our respon-
sibilities in the present war and
our tasks in the coming peace and
social reconstruction. Our genera-
tion actively sought peace, but the
advance of aggressive. fascism,
coupled with our failures to exter-
minate the arrogant and cruel de-
lusions of inequality, injustice and

' exploitation imposed upon weaker

peoples and national minorities,
has brought us again to war.»I-t is
incumbent upon us at this time to
clarify thevissues of this conﬂict
that we may develop a complete
unity of purpose and mutual con-
ﬁdence among those peoples allied
with the United Nations and the
peoples of all the nations of the

‘world under the banner of the

Four Freedoms.

We alfirm our united determina-
tion to ﬁght on to the complete
rout of fascism, whose philosophy
we consider to be destructive of
all the best instincts of mankind.
By their ruthless aggression they
have forged unityi among the
freedom-loving peoples of the
‘world which shall be their undo-
ing. This unity we shall preserve
and strengthen.

ONFIDENT in our ultimate

victory, not only for ourselves a

‘but for the subjugated peoples of
the world, we do not need to con-
ceal the critical character of the
present hour. We are in deadly
da.nger. The youth of the Soviet
Union in their dogged, unﬂinching
resistance to the Nazi invader, is

ﬁghting a crucial battle of utmost
importance to all of us. For more
than ﬁve years the valiant youth
of China intheir determined strug-
gle for exstence and independence
against their enemy, the Japanese
invader, have given us a magniﬁ-
cent example of the will to achieve
ﬁnal freedom. The youth of Great
Britain have displayed their‘ valor
in every area of the world where
the enemy’s threat was greatest.
The courageous youth of the occu-
pied countries have shown their
willingness to die rather than to
submit to, subjugation, and they
await only the military call of the
United Nations to make even
greater sacriﬁces.

The youth of the United States
have taken up the challenge from
their veteran allies and are join-
ing them in the struggle for lib-
eration from tyranny.

UR leaders

stand united to back up with
action their pledges to the Soviet
Union for invasion of the Euro-
pean continent in the shortest pos-
sible time. We await the signal.‘
The European continent must be
free.

Our ﬁrst task is to defeat the
enemies on the battleﬁeld} To
this we pledge our full energies.
The job of the soldiers is to be-
come better ﬁghters; of students
in the universities to prepare
themselves as rapidly as possible
for war service; of men and wom-
en in the factories and labora-
tories to produce as much as pos-
sible; of men and women on the
farms to make the land give un-
precedented yield.

THIS is not enough. In order to
release the total energies of
the peoples of the world, we must
demonstrate our good faith by as-
suring all men the right to.partici-
pate fully and equally in the strug-
gle for freedom. Therefore we
must not be guilty of fostering
the same doctrine of racial su-

=Werhave a new problem to consider in connection with
 ncoming Pitt-Southern Methodist football game this Sat-
 ay. It concerns the quality of resiliency or just how much
he.Panther gridders have in them. I

I They were expected to give the highly touted Minnesota
__ophers stiff opposition last weekend, but were decisively

rampled, 50-7. It now remains for them to demonstrate
ether they have enough elasticity to bounce back, and if
t, ‘y do, will it be in the face of the Mustang aerial circus.

C ‘I Here in Pittsburghthe ﬁnal score was not considered im-
ossible, but it was thought to be highly improbable. Reports
om the coachng staffs showed that nothng more disconcert-
q ‘gthana close loss was anticipated, and there were lyrical
_ hopes for a victory. At the end of the afternoon the clouds

‘fwere the darkest for the Panthers went down to the worst de-
0 yfeatin, the modern history of the school. A

5', ii  Unfortunately or otherwise, there is no way we can peel
‘ }.the.“shirts from the football players and tell what psycho-
'”gical effect this disastrous adventure against Minnesotadid
 ozthem. Will they rebound against Southern Methodist with
Cjtshe real potentialities that they have hidden away or will they
;j_ifbe demoralized by their loss, and sulk while the Mustang
/ﬁbacks go running by? '

 ' We, for some uncanny reason,‘can’t call them out. In
‘ur minds they are still a ﬁne ball team. It is true they lost
y a decisive score, but there. were many bright spots shining
hrough the darkness.

C p A The outstanding was probably Anthony “Primo” DiMat-
, '-fee who made himself last Saturday afternoon by galloping
~ tlie 98 yards for P'itt’s only score. “Primo,” it seems, was kept
1 tinder cover by the Panther grid staff during most of last
L-;.spring’s training season. They knew he was good. They ex-

iiected a lot from him, and yet they wanted to let him prove
, ij?~i3l:j‘to‘the critics instead of using a great deal of the usual col-
ﬁ7?"legiate ballyhoo. He proved it last week. Proved beyond a
g. .doubt the truth of backﬁeld coach “Curly” Stebbins’ statement
lﬁfwhen he said that he just couldn’tteach DiMatteo anymore for
he was a natural football player.

i  In intra-squad tilts, DiMatteo habitually romped through
‘the ﬁrst team for touchdowns. He threw the ball with equal
/race, and on the defense backed up the front wall with ﬁ-
nesse.

 [j ’ But DiMatteo isn’t the whole ball club. Far from it. Coach
Charley Bowser has Bill Dutton, Walter West, and Frank Sak-
sa_to.round out a well-rounded backﬁeld.

 The line you ask? Well,,,that’s a bit different. There is no

ife or Gervelis to plug up holes, and judging from last Satur-

:ay’s ﬁasco, it is woefully weak. The ends are inadequate,
nd the Gopher backs had a ﬁeld day traveling around them.

~ .;;iy So the Pitt axiom of a “pass, kick, and a prayer” should
be ﬁne next week providing they can ﬁnd a consistent punter
[and an accurate passer.

dist in the home opener at the Sta-
dium on Saturday.

This will be the third local meet-
ing of the teams with SMU still
trying for its first win over the
Panthers. Ih 1938 the Panthers
under Dr. Jock Sutherland set
about to defeat SMU’s famed
“aerial circus,” put Marshall Gold-
berg in the unaccustomed role of
forward passer, and romped home
with a 34 to 6 victory.

The last meeting of the two teams
in 1940 was memorable chieﬂy for
a 7-7 tie, a record breaking 92

the eﬂicials who covered a punt so
closely that he wound up on the
bottom instead of on top of‘ the
play, and an hour and a half con-
cert tendered by the SMU swing
band after the game.

This will be the second “orphan-
ed” team the Panthers have play-
for Mustang Head Coach Matty
Bell, like Bernie Bierman, Is serv-
ing in the Navy at the Naval Avia-
tion Pre Flight School in Georgia.
At present the squad is being tu-
tored by Jimmy Stewart who
doubles in the role of Athletic Di-
rector.

The SMU team ﬁgures at best to
be rather unpredictable. Like the
Panthers they opened the season
Saturday; playing against North
Texas Teachers College and easily
took the game 26 to 7. Panther

rooters may draw any conclusions
they like from the fact that last“

year the Mustangs thoroughly

smothered the same squad 54 to 0. E

The gMustang team which last
year/won 5
ten game schedule, lost few men
to the armed forces. In fact only
two members who were eligible
for the team were called into ser-
vice, and, with the exception of
sophomore Tom ’ Dean at left
tackle, all the members of the
starting lineup are lettermen. Two
year lettermen are Right Tackle
Clarence Booth, Right Guard ‘Or-
ville Johnson, and Left End Kel-
ly Simpson. 7 I

Pitt ﬁgures to-be ‘more: evenly

matched against the Mustangs than ‘

against Minnesota, who, after all,
represents the class of collegiate
football circles. The Panther squad

will also go into the SMU game

with the advantage of having had
some actual game experience, an
important factor, inasmuch as the
Pitt starting lineup that made its

debut against Minnesota had ex-‘V
actly four members on it who were '

regulars last year, West, Saksa,
Dillon, and Allshouse.
