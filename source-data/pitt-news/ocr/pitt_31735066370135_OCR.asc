Modern Adoption

Methods Raise Ethical Questions

By WES COTTER

Betty lives in Fullerton, Califor-

~ nia and has a husband, a three-

bedroom house and a beagle. For
Betty, these things aren’t enough;
she wants a baby.

Her name has been on the county
adoption list for three years with no
results, so she sends a check once a
month to The Pitt News and college
newspapers in Arkansas and Iowa to
advertise for a baby.

Betty and her husband are only
one of many couples who are infer-
tile and tired ofwaiting for thetradi-
tional adoption system to find a
healthy, white baby. Betty said she
waits for the phone to ring and hear
a pregnant college girl say she wants
a nice home for her baby.

Advertising for babies is illegal in
California and other states. The Pitt
News has carried advertisements
from couples in, among others, New
York, New Jersey, Connecticut,
North Carolina and California.

Classified ads seeking infants for
adoption appear in college newspap-

,girl’s

ers in every state that legally permits
it. Finding children through the
classifieds like some people find
cars, however, raises moral and ethi-
cal questions for people in the adop-
tion ﬁeld.

“Large sums of money are trading
hands,” said Peggy Herr, counselor
at the Children’s Home of Pitts-
burgh, the city's traditional adop-
tion agency.

Herr said her concern is the type
of parents trying this method.

“If they see the waiting list is long,
they do anything lawyers advise,”
she said. “A large number of emo-
tional abuses could be occuring.
Some of these couples have been
rejected for good reasons.”

Couples all over the country are
looking for babies and will pay a
birthing expenses, usually
about $10,000, to get one. These
expenses include whatever the girl
needs during her last months of
pregnancy, hospital costs, room and
board and doctors’ and lawyers‘
fees.

But Betty explained that she
doesn‘t have to run the ads but she

wants a baby now.

“There are girls who are pregnant
and need help."

Kathy lives in New York and is in
a similar situation.

“We just want to love a baby and
give it the best gift I can give at this
stage of her life, the chance to raise it
and give it the love I have to offer,”
she said.

Kathy has one child already who
is the daughter of a nursing student
who didn‘t want to abort her baby
and decided instead to give her baby
to an infertile couple if they would
pay her expenses.

“We’ve had her since she was four-
days old, and we couldn’t love her

anymore,” Kathy said. “It's a gift to ’

give your child to someone who
really wants it.”

Adoption agencies, both tradi-
tional and modern, agree with this,
but there are people who are Con-
cerned about the way some new
methods affect both the mother and
child.

“She [the birth mother] is liable to
believe anything she‘s told. Their

Enrollment Increases

Computer Networking

Agreement
By RAY OWENS

A decision is soon to be made
that will define the “campus of
the future” at the University of
Pittsburgh, according to . Dr.
Jack Freeman, senior vice-
chancellor for administration at
Pitt. '

AT&T, Northern Telecom-
munications and Bell Atlantic
are in negotiation now with the
university to provide the com-
munication network crucial to
the future of academic comput-
ing here, Freeman said.

Noting that the negotiations
are at a sensitive stage, Freeman
declined to comment further,
except to say that the figures
quoted in the report of the Task
Force on the Future ofAcademic
Computing at. Pitt were “what
people would like to have" but
not necessarily what would they
would get.

The task forces recommenda-
tion called for a total outlay of
nearly $37 million over the next 3

years, $10 million of which

Imminent

would go for the communica-
tions network.

The task force, formed as a
subcommittee under the Joint
Committee for Long Range
Planning, painted a “broad-
brushed view of the story,” Free-
man said, and input is still
coming from University Senate
committees, vendors and the
task force subcommittees.

This news comes on the heels
of the extravagant “Computer
Faire” hosted by the university.
Encompassing a broad range of
topics and involving a host of
vendors, the fair was designed to
give the academic community a
chance to view the hardware and
consider the issues that face Pitt
today, according to Mr. Thomas
Neudecker, chairman of the
Microcomputer Working Group
of the task force. ’

Neudecker, as part of the fair,
led a discussion on the role of
microcomputers in the university
network. He said that input from

Specialized Nursing: A Growing Trend

By PAM CYGRYMUS

Pitt senior Diane Wallowicz will
graduate with a B.A. in political
science in April and has decided to
enroll in St. Francis nursing school
in September.

“l wanted a broad education,” she
said.

According to the National League
of Nursing,(NLN), a record number
of ll6,896 students entered nursing
programs in I981-82. The number of
applicants increased from 212,813 in
1980-81 to 238,884 in 1982-83.

Dorothy O’Connor, administra-
tive assistant to the director of com-
munication for the NLN, said more
and more nurses are beginning to
specialize. There is a growing need
for nurses with a master’s degree, she
said.'

A new trend in the field, according
to O’Connor, is that people with
degrees and jobs in other fields are
turning to nursing. This will bring
“dive rsity” to the profession, O’Con-
nor said. “It can only enrich the
field.”

Wallowicz has been a unit secre-
tary at St. Francis for five years and
said that it had a definite influence
on her decision. The reason she
chose a diploma school is that she
didn’t want to spend another four
years in school. “I can always go
back to school and get a B.S.," she
said.

Education in nursing is a dynamic
aspect of the field, according to Dr.
Kathleen Waleko, assistant admin-
istrative director of staff and consu-
mer services at McGee Women‘s
Hospital.

One of ‘her responsibilities at

McGee isto provide continuing edu-

cation programs for all employees
and patients. Staff members and
patients also have access to informa-
tion through McGee’s library which
includes audio visual services.

There are a variety of programs an
aspiring nurse can choose from
when considering what type of edu-
cation is right for him or her. The
program offered at Pitt is the four
year baccalaureate degree. Other
programs offered are associate
degree programs, usually offered by
community colleges and diploma
schools, which are usually affiliated-
with a hospital.

Diane Caputo, a I983 graduate of
Pitt’s School of Nursing, is presently
working at Presbyterian-University
Hospital. “I ‘m glad that I went to the
four-year program,” she said.
Caputo feels that it will be easier to
“move up and move on" since she
received a B.S. degree right away.

tell us something. And finally, I was
here when the adviser of seven years
moved on to greener pastures away
from this university.

But even though there have been
bad times with this job, there also
has been a share of good times and
funny anecdotes that most people
would not believe unless they hung
around the fourth floor on a day—to-
day basis.

When Stonewall Stickney fell or
was pushed from the 15th floor of
the Cathedral and landed ina court-

story. I remember that Mary Kane
and I beat the campus and city police

to the scene, something that still has *

me baffled two years later. If you
were the first to arrive at the scene of
an accident or murder, who would
you call first, the~police or a news-
paper?

and some of the insipid videos
shown on MTV only reinforce my
convictions. Oh, by the way, I still
haven’t heard from the football team
about a “gang bang," so I guess I still
don’t know what it’s like to have my
heart broken by a man.

No, I’m still not particularly fond

Making Our Voices
Heard By Others

By MICHAEL WEINMAN

As a writer for The Pitt News, I
and the rest of this masochistic staff
have the rather dubious distinction
of being able to publicly humiliate
ourselves in front of 48,000 Pitts-
burghers and do so voluntarily no
less.

This being the last issue of the
term, the newpaper staff(as I'm sure
you can tell from the other opinions)
has been given a little greater lati-
tude for self-indulgence, and not
wanting to miss out on this bi-
annual event, there are a few com-
ments I would like to empart.

Most of my articles tend to deal
with political events, and as a result,
I probably have the fewest but most
opinionated readers. The Pitt News
has recently tried to raise the bulk of
the paper out of the arena of a
college-oriented National Enquirer.
Any self-respecting Pitt student
should be embarrassed if the best his

» paper can offer is trivialized articles

on whether another fast food joint
will get its liquor licence.

They should be even more embar-
rassed if they’re satisfied with that
type of a paper. Despite some«stu-
dent resistance to change, I think the
newspaper should be applauded for
its advances into more
journalism.

We, whether you like it or not. will
be the people running this country.
That very thought I’m sure sends
shivers down the backs of most of
our parents and certainly anyone
who‘s been sober in Zelda's on a
Thursday, Friday orSaturday night.
We, as college students with the
third largest circulating newspaper
in the city, have the opportunity to
let our views be read and not allow
ourselves to be overly concerned
with what “the boss" or any other
authority figure might think.

This, of course,«is not an invita-
tion for hackjournalism, but rather,
a chance for all of us to take advan-
tage ofone ofthe few areas in which

society actually expects us to go out-

on a limb and raise the issues and
express our thoughts ~ thoughts
that make sedetary people a little
uncomfortable and possibly a little
better.

Since l‘ve been at Pitt, this has
been one of the most politically
active times in the school's recent
history, and still fewer than 200 peo-
ple turned out for one ofthe schools
more-publicized political events, the
Grenadian “Teach-Ins," not to men-
tion at least I0 nuclear arms discus-
sion panels.

I’m not calling for everyone to
become a bunch of highbrow, elitist

pseudo-intellectuals; someone can
be smart and have a good time, too.
I’m not even asking for your opinion
on any particular topic, but, next
fall, you will be.

During Reagan’s term in office.
we've suffered under one ofthe most
inept and bungling oafs in American‘
political history. He has never
claimed to know anything about for-

serious A

eign affairs, and unfortunately, in

one instance, he has kept his word.

Some say he has made some pro-
gress in the domestic economy for
those who can afford to take advan-

tage of his tax breaks or wait for the ‘

prophesied “trickle down.” No, I
don’t think I’ll be voting for this mil-
itaristic, anachronistic, miscast, tin
cowboy. But Ronny thinks he has a
mandate: from 28 percent of the
people?

What I’m trying to get at is that as
Pitt students, you have a very pow-
erful vehicle at your command. You
have a newspaper that will let you
tell more people other than.your
roommate what you think is wrong
or right.

Only ll percent of college stu-
dents voted in the I980 election, and
most of those voted'by absentee bal-
lot. lfthe candidates were concerned
about the college vote, they would
lobby powerfully during the
absentee-voting period; but the can-
didates don‘t. As far as they're con-
cerned, you don't have an opinion,
you don't have an impact.

But you could here in these pages
if you wanted to. And if you don’t
want to, then you deserve all the
Ronald Reagans you can get.

Three Years In Retrospect

continued from page four
Pitt‘s Greek system as a whole needs
a major overhaul. It could only work
to its advantage.

And yes, I still think that the
sticker program initiated by the City
of Pittsburgh in various parts of
South Oakland is unfairito all other
residents of the city. C

Finally, I think I can honestly say
the greatest of my joys have come
with working with the talented staff
of The Pitt News, both past and
present.

Somebody once wrote a letter
after some controversy and asked
for the resignation ofthe entire staff.
I would like to see him or any_other
person who thinks he knows it all go

up to the fourth floor and try to put
out a better product. The Pitt News
editors and staff members are some
of the better people I have ever
worked with and for.

To be able to put out a quality
newspaper three times a week at a
university that does not have ajour-
nalism school —‘ or even a journal-

ism department — is no easy feat. ‘-

Their professionalism and dedica-
tion is to be commended.

I don‘t k-now how I will spend my
time next term; I can’t imagine actu-
ally getting sleep, being able to
watch “Happy Days" on Tuesday
nights and having my social life back
again.jl guess I’ll adjust, though.

-_ And so it goes.

The Pitt News, Monday, December 5, I983],

Page 5

Dear Editor;

Barton Levenson‘s letter of Nov.
30 responds to my pro-life argu-
ments. I would first like to address
the side issues he raised. The author
labels my argument a “slide argu-
ment” that “attempts to enlist sup-
ports out of fear." These are ad
hominem comments and in no way
refutewhat has been said. The socie-
ties cited as permitting some form of
non-personhood while excluding
others support my contention that
dividing lines between persons and
non-persons are purely arbitrary.

In traditional societies, these arbi-
trary decisions are accepted without
question and remain stable over
long periods of time. In our non-
traditional society, however, morals
are constantly changing, and an
injudicious decision today is open to
exploitation tomorrow.

Mr. Levenson must keep in mind
that in our society, laws do not mean

' merely what they say but also what
they imply. Once we have legislation
or common law implying that per-
sonhood and humanity are non-
synonymous, there is nothing to
prevent the courts or popular opin-
ion from expanding that notion to
new situations. Abortion, infanti-
cide and geronticide are all based on
this notion and differ only in the
time ofits application; they must be
considered together.

Mr. Levenson points out that the
Nazis outlawed abortion, but this
applied only to the German race and
flowed from the reasoning that the
superior Aryan race must expand
and populate the lands ofother non-
persons. Protection for the unborn
was not extended to other ethnic
groups or to German political

prisoners.
Now on to the main issue. lcritic-
ized the principle of non-

personhood on the grounds that not
a judge, a time limit or a set of cri-
teria have been agreed upon and
that the candidates advanced for
these slots are vaguely defined, arbi-
trary and subjective.

Mr. Levenson attempts to alle-
viate this situation by dismissing
any need for a judge or a set of cri-
teria. He proposes instead an auto-
matic process whereby at birth
(“whenever it takes place”), an indi-
vidual becomes a person. Thus, Mr.
Levenson opposes infanticide. So
far so good.

In support of his nomination of
birth as the time limit for person-
hood, Mr. Levenson advances the
idea that “first consciousness is a
clear dividing line" between persons
and non-persons —- by which, if I

understand him correctly, he means
that first consciousness is synchro-
nousgwith birth and that it endues
suddenly. What is the evidence for
this blanket assertion‘? Can the
author demonstrate “conscious-
ness“ in a I0-minute -old infant, and
can he demonstrate the lack of this
consciousness in the same infant I0
minutes before birth‘?

Consciousness is surely related to
brain-nerve activity; yet by this
proposal, a premature infant with
less brain-nerve development has
consciousness, while, prior to birth,
a full-term fetus with more brain-
nerve development has none. Fur-
thermore, mentally handicapped
infants (who are certainly post-
birth) may yet lack the conscious-
ness Mr. Levenson claims is there.

The assertion that “first con-

sciousness is a clear dividing line”
cannot go unchallenged. In the first
place, what does “consciousness“
actually mean (vague definition)? If
we agree on what it means, how can
we detect it? Consciousness is an
.abstract contruce, not a physical
characteristic that shows up on a
machine (subjective criterion).
Finally, why should consciousness
be accepted at all as the basis of
personhood ~— the author offers no
reasons for his choice other than
personal preference (arbitrary
choice)?

The comment that “conscious-
ness...is a better [dividing line]
than... conception" is easily refuted.
In contrast to the above, note that
conception (and oogensis, as Mr.
Levenson justly pointed out) is a
clearly defined, unquestionably
objective phenomenon that consti-
tutes the logical beginning of every
human life. Mr. Levenson suggests
in passing that implantation be the
criterion, but there is no reason to
suppose that implantation is necess-
ary for life —— I refer here to the
advance of technology, which may
yet find a way to nurse an embryo in
a laboratory right through the. usual
uterine period. By the implantation
theory, these individuals would not
be persons.

So let‘s abandon the idea of first
consciousness and return to the
proposal of birth as a dividing line.
This proposal is also arbitrary and
probably subjective — does birth
correspond to any really fundamen-
tal change in the personhood of the
individual (change in environment,
respiration, feeding system etc., all
seem superficial)? But be that as it
may, the term “birth” is not defined
in Mr. Levenson‘s letter. Is it a pro-
cess that begins with the onset of

Laws A/so Mean What They lmply ,

labor or an instantaneous affair‘? I
will assume the latter. Does it
include premature, induced and
Caesarean births‘? I will assume it
does.

What is the essential component
of birth?__

Is it the emergence ofthe individ-
ual into the outer world. the onset of
breathing or the cutting of the
umbilical cord? I will assume the
first.

What then of the time when our
technology disposes of the need for
a human womb at all? These indi-
viduals would never be “born" and
would not qualify as persons (a race
of drones?). But there are conse-
quences ofthis reasoning that strike
much closer to home. The above
definition of birth means that many
abortions are in fact murder.

lfa premature infant delivered by
Caesarean is a person, then by the
above definition of birth, so is an
infant aborted by hysterotomy (late-
term Caesarean in which the infant
is killed or left to die after removal
from the womb), an individual
aborted by dilation and evacuation
(by sucking out the womb) and an
embryo aborted by endometrical
aspiration (very early term suction).
Recall that time plays no role here;
the only factor is emergence from
the womb “whenever it takes place."
These forms of abortion constitute
murder by Mr. Levenson‘s criterion
of birth.

lfthis is so, then a strong case can
be made that other forms of abor-
tion are also murder. By the proce-
dure of cutterage, a fetus is
dismembered in the womb( where
he is not a person), then suctioned
out (where, if he were alive, he
would be a person). Is it logical to
maintain that to suction out a fetus,
then dismember him, is murder, but
to dismember him, then suction him
out, is not? I think not. This same
objection ultimately carries over to
any form of abortion at any time
following conception.

And so we are back to concep-

tion. Mr. Levenson calls it a “divid- I

ing line" for personhood, which
suggests to me that he has quite
missed the point. Conception does
not divide a personal being from a
non-personal being, but rather
separates existence from non-
existence. The point is that there is
no dividing line for personhood: it is
inherent in every human being from
the very start of his existence —
conception.

Nursing Trend Grows

continued from page one

West Penn Hosital and St. Fran-
cis are two local hospital which have
diploma schools. Karen Cygrymus,
a student at St. Francis, decided to
go the route of diploma school. She
explained she could be a working
R.N. within two years, as opposed to
a three or four-year program offered
by area colleges. She said she likes
the idea that there is no distribution
of studies and can therefore concen-
trate on nursing.

Cygv nus said she was on a clini-
cal floor the second day of class.
This is a good practice, she said,
because “you find out right away if
you can hack it.” She noted that in
four-year programs, clinical expe-
rience comes only about half way
through a student’s studies. This she
feels is “a little” late to find out that
you don’t like nursing after all.

Allegheny Community College
offers a three-year associate degree
program in nursing. Donna Rizzo, a
I980 graduate of the program is
working in the intensive care unit at
Divine Providence Hospital and is
currently working toward a B.S. .

Rizzo said she hopes to work for a
program like Allegheny General
Hospital’s Life Flight.

O‘Connor said that the nursing
field is opening up more for males,
too. She said she predicts there will

be an increase in the number of

males entering nursing programs in
the future.

The job market in Pittsburgh is
not at its best in terms of nursing
positions. Waleko and Caputo
attribute this to the employment in
the area. “People just don’t have
jobs, so they don’t have money or
benefits to cover hospital care,"
Caputo said.

Waleko said new leg .lation that
will affect Medicare and Medicaid
recipients may also affect the

number of layoffs and the declining '

need for nurses. The new legislation
will put a pro-active policy of reim-
bursement into effect. This means
Diagnostic Related Groups (ORG)
will determine how much medical
care should cost, and hospitals will
be compelled to stay within the lim-
its set by the DRG. People are put-
ting off elective surgery and going to
the hospital less, Waleko said.

the user community was impor-
tant in the selection ofvendors to’
recommend to the university.

According to Neudecker, the
task force and the Computer
Faire are evidence of the com-
mitment by the university to
upgrade the computing environ-
ment at Pitt.

Historically, Neudecker said,
Pitt has enjoyed a close working
relationship with Digital Equip-
ment Corporation, which built
the DEC-l0 main-frame compu-
ter that is currently the mainstay
of Pitt’s system. The 1982 deci-
sion by Digital to abandon pro-
duction of its Jupiter model, for
which Pitt had already con-
tracted, forced the university to
take a hard look at the future,
said Neudecker.

The Jupiter, the expected next
generation of main-frame com-
puters, was scrapped when
breakthroughs in microchip
design made it obsolete. Digital
redirected itseefforts to produce
the new VAX line of super-
powerful minicomputers, Neu-
decker said.

The university currently owns
two of the VAX computers.
Word is expected soon on the
signing of an $8 million co-
research project with DEC, that
would provide much of the hard-
ware to be used in the network-
ing process. .

Dr. Robert Comfort of the
Remote Job Entry subcommit-
tee of the task force said that the
initial plans‘ to have the VAX

Gaming Club Offers Adventure

By BRIAN FOSTER

Upon entering the room, the
excitement and mystique could be
felt. On one side of the room, seven
students -— makeshift vigilantes -
were deciding what to do with a bad
guy who wouldn't give them the

‘information they needed; on the

other side of the room, the crew of
the U.S.S. Enterprise was getting
ready for a confrontation with a
Klingon ship.

The two groups were playing
games called Champions and Star
Trek, respectively, and this was the
sight of the weekly meeting of the
Pitt Gaming Club. The club meets
every Saturday morning on the fifth
floor ofthe William Pitt Union from
noon until l0‘p.m. '

According to club member and

vice-president Cheryl Galbreath, the
club was originally titled the Pitt
Wargamers Club. Club members

played war board games, where the ~

rules are very concrete and use ofthe
imagination is very limited. Since
the transformation from the Warga-
mers Club to the Gaming Club, the
members have started playing more
fantasy and imagination games such
as Dungeons and Dragons and
Illuminati.

Members of the club decide what
games to play the morning of the
meeting. The choice of games, how-
ever, is not limited. The club itself
presently owns about 12 games, and
whichever games the club does not
have are often owned by one or more
of the members. While the members
maintain that they will play any
games at all, they "nainly like to deal

with those on the fantasy and imagi-
nation level.

“Lots of people live alone, and
they have trouble finding partners to
play their games," member Robert
Milson said. “We provide people to
play the games with them."

In the future, the club hopes to get
more people involved. Eventually it
hopes to expand it meetings to three
or four times a week, in which each
meeting is for a specific game (i.e.,
on Monday, Dungeons and Drag-
ons; on Wednesday, Champion;
etc.).

There are not any qualifications
necessary to join the club and eve-
ryone is welcome. “A major problem
we have is that a lot of people show
up once, but we never see them
again,” said club president Bruce
Huttner.

The wheel held little good for-
tune for three students who
represented Pitt on the game
show “Wheel of Fortune” this
past weekend.

Barry Bartusiak, Maria Jaeger
and K.J. Jones travelled to Hol-
lywood to participate in College
Week on the NBC game show
along with students from Notre
Dame, Alabama and UCLA.

The shows for College Week,
which will run from today
through Friday Dec. 9, were all
filmed in Burbank on Saturday.
They will be aired locally on
WPXI (Channel ll) at ll a.m.
daily. . 

For the first four days of Col- O
lege Week, three contestants

from each school compete and

their winnings are totaled, and
the top three schools compete
Friday for the championship of
the week.

Jaeger will represent Pitt on
today’s show. Unfortunately, she
hit “Bankrupt” twice and wonrno
money while a student from
UCLA won close to $1 l,000.

On Tuesday’s show, Bartusiak
can be seen winning $300, the
most by anyone from Pitt, by
solving the puzzle “Baton
Rouge, La.” Prizes are bought
with the money earned by solv-
ing the puzzle, and Bartusiak
purchased four polo shirts from
Giorgio’s of Beverly Hills for
$l95 and received a gift certifi-
cate for $l05 from Tiffany’s.

"Jones will compete on the
Wednesday edition of the show.
He won $200 solving “Natural
Phenomena” and also purchased

Students Travel To ‘Wheel Of Fortune’;  

the four shirts for $l95. A stu- it

dent from Notre Dame won’
$8,000 on Wednesday.

Pitt took fourth place, totaling
$500 in winnings, and didn't get
to play for the championship on
Friday.

Rich Rosenbaum, who also
travelled with the team, will geta
chance to play the evening ver-

sion of the show, to be aired
later. .

Bartusiak said he would do it
all over again, despite not win;

ning his round and having to pay A

for the trip himself.

i“lt is something that liwill
always remember. I really felt

~ good about representing Pitt, A

and the kids from the other
schools were really great,” he
said. “How. many people have
ever gotten to see the Pacific
Ocean orbe on television?”

goaI"is to get that baby any way they
can. _Merr said. She added that new
agencies us_e methods that are

. unfeeling toward the birth mother.

Herr said legal adoption takes six
months to get the paperwork and
legal work finished. In this period, a
birth mother can still claim her child
if she has a change of heart. For this
reason, The Children’s Home places
infants in a foster home until the
legal work is finished so a couple will
not be hurt ifthe mother changes her
mind.

New agencies, such as the much-
publicized Golden Cradle in Phila-
delphia, take the child immediately
to the adoptive parents because they
have paid the expenses. Actions in
which the mother later decides to
take her baby harm both the couple
and the birth mother, Herr said.

“The agency cares for the child
until the law is ironed out. With a
lawyer in charge, they takethe baby
right to the adoptive parents instead
of the foster home," she said.

A problem with the birth mother
getting her. baby back is the pressure
she feels because her expenses have
been paid, Herr said. This pressure is
taken away by the agency because
they pay the bills.

“I think adoption is a good thing,
but professionally licenced people
should be doing it,” Herr said. “We
shouldn’t just toss a baby out the
window to whomever catches it."

Herr said people who find babies
for other people like lawyers, who
have b-ecome quite active in this
field, are working primarily for the
baby.

Money changes hands in all the
modern adoption cases, and this
worries a great many people who are
concerned about salesmen out to
make a buck. The court allows for a
reasonable amount of money for
expenses and medical costs, but this
practice is so new that a working
definition of “-reasonable" varies
from one judge to another.

Aggressive adoption efforts
started in Philadelphia with a man
named Arty Elgart. Elgart is the
owner of an autoparts warehouse
and is described as a brash, can-do
guy who is a very good salesman. He
became involved in the adoption
process when he discovered his wife
could not give birth.After proceed-
ing through regular channels he
received no action and decided to set
up his own adoption with a college
girl who needed help. He succeeded
in finding one only after his wife
became pregnant, so he gave the
child to another infertile couple. In
January, 1980, Elgert placed his first
baby for adoption and soon after,
the Golden Cradle was born.

Elgert has used advertising on
interstate billboards, television,

park benches and even tray liners at

Burger King’s. He said hejust wants
to find people who don’t want to be
single parents and help them out ofa
tough spot.

Elgart hasn’t opened franchises,

but organizations very similar to his .

have been created, and one ha_s
opened in Pittsburgh. Its official
title is The Family Infertility and
Adoption Center but is also called
Adoption With a Difference.

The agency arrived in Pittsburgh
and used many ofthe same tactics as
Elgart: advertising on billboards
with slogans such as: Pregnant?
Alone? Confused? Afraid? Call 555-
BABY.

Family Infertility received some
not-so-friendly reactions in Pitts-
burgh; however, and was soon in
court. Several complaints were reg-
istered against the agency in relation
to their high rates which range from
$4000 to $5000.

Allegheny County Orphan‘s
Court judge Eunice Ross, after an
investigation of the rates,said that
advertising costs, some counseling
charges and a variety of other
charges constituted “Huckstering in
human infants.”

Her decision was appealed, and a
six-member panel of judges decided
that the new agency had a clear
financial interest in getting the
women to give up their babies. They
also said advertising constituted a
direct effort to corner the white

The Pitt News, Monday, December 5, I983

infant market. The panel ruled to
uphold Ross‘ decision and went one
step further by devising a law that
states: “All adoption placement enti-
ties may follow suit and also com-
petitively bid for the small pool of
white, non-handicapped infants."
The decision is pending in Alle-
gheny County, but. is being

‘appealed. If upheld, it could change

the face of adoption and give infants
to the ‘agencies with the biggest ad
campaigns.

. “There’s a special need to help
infertile couples" is how the recep-
tionist who didn’t wish to give her
name described the agency. "We
don’t buy babies. That scares me to
even hear that.”

“We use a great deal of mass
media, and we involve the birth cou-
ple with adoptive parents," Family
Infertility counselor Nancy Simpro-
nio said.

She said the agency, which is
licensed by the state, uses TV, radio

and members ofthe community like
ministers to help spread their mes-
sage. With couples seeking babies
advertising and placing fliers and so
forth on college campuses, Simpro-
nio said, her agency can place achild
with a couple in one year instead of
five or six.

Rock.

Efforts to find pregnant college
girls are usually sucessful, but, Sim-
pronio said, “It‘sjust my experience
as a college student to say that a high
percentage ofcollege women do ter-
minate their pregnancies.” She also
said there are the girls who need this
service and this is why they concen-
trate on advertising on campuses.

College-age girls who don’t want
tp terminate their babies will many
times choose this option so they can
escape the high medical costs
involved with having a baby. Family

like others of its kind, and the girl
stays with a family waiting for
another baby for which the agency is
arranging adoption.

She said Family Infertility is cur-
rently charging a 7.5 percent .of the
joint family income from the pre-
vious year with a ceiling of up to
$3,400 for a baby.

She said the agency is doing well
in spite of problems and is placing
slightly more babies than tradition
agencies.

“It’s up to the individual. Some
think it’s ok. Others think the risks
are too high, but it offers others
safety," Simpronio said. She added
that couples can work through a pri-
vate doctor or lawyer like their
agency did before licensing, but
there can be problems with this
method. When asked how she felt
about a girl who might give her baby
to the highest bidder, she said,
“She’s selling her baby. If you're
breaking theglaw, that’s it."

Panthers Thrash IUP 86-54, Still Unbeaten

By CHARLIE O'HARA

Saturday night's Pitt-Indiana bas-

ketball match-up marke_d the third
game of a three-game road series -
West Virginia, Penn State and Pitt
--— for the Indians (0-3).

For the third straight time. IUP
was heavily overmatched.

Despite a relatively close first half,
Pitt leading 33-26, the Panthers
exploited the opposition’s lack of
speed. The 86-54 final score proved
to be a true reflection of the game.

For IUP, the early season mis-
matches, losses to WVU (73-46) and
PSU (81-49), are frustrating.

“Pitt, Penn State and West Virgi-
nia are the big time for us,” Indian
guard Kevin Bouknight said. “Our
goal coming into [tonight’s] game
was to slow everything down. We
were able to keep it close, but they’re
too talented. Things got way out of
hand with about l0 minutes to go."

The Panthers received good
marks when the Indians were asked
to compare the three teams.

“The teams have different styles,"
forward Ellison Huggins said.
“Penn State and West Virginia are
more physical. Pitt is just so quick.
And Clyde Vaughan [29 points and
seven rebounds], you can put five

_ guys or: him, and he still sinks it.”

“Pit: f:'s::s great team speed,” IUP
head mach iom Beck said. “Penn
State and \""':.st Virginia have com-
parable inside games, but Pitt‘s
speed is so much tougher to-over-
come. Vaughan could play for any-
body in the country. He’s a credit to
the University of Pittsburgh and the
sport. You can’t let him get hot, or
they’ll be very difficult to contain."

“Pitt is much better than the other
two,” IU P assistant coach Tony Ber-
nardi said. “As far as team quickness
goes, it’s hard for me to believe that
there are too many teams that have
more in the country. Their guards
are the best we’ve faced. We tried to

knows that’s almost impossible. The

be something. He’s got unbelievea-
ble poise. He plays like he's been out
there for four years.”

which Vaughan led all scorers with 29 points. ' ~

For Pitt, the early season report
card is promising. The usually slow
starting Panthers are 3-0, even iftwo
of the three wins came at home
against Division II schools.

The team’s strengths are surfac-

The 6-4 1/2, 2lO-1b.senior’s2l, 24

the season are impressive. He is the
team’s model of consistency.

The Billy Culbertson/ Aiken point

the Pitt football team’s early-season
quarterback competition, which
proved quite successful.

Excitement is increasing as the
Pitt men’s gymnastics squad pre-
pares for its second international
meet in as many years when the
Japanese University all-star
team opposes the Panthers later
this week.

On Dec. 9 at 8 p.m., the Field
House will be the site of this
second consecutive international
extravaganza when the East
meets the West. Last year, the
Soviets visited the Field House in
a first-ever meet on the Oakland
campus.

This year's meet, though.
could have an added twist. The
meet could possibly be the show-

8 case of the up-and-coming gym-
nastics stars to compete in the
I984 Summer Olympic Games.
The Japanese team is reported to
possess a number of world class
gymnasts who will perform in
Los Angeles.

After hosting the Soviet
Bourevestnik University
national team last year, Pitt
men’s coach Frank D‘Amico was
more than encouraged when he
received a call from the Interna-
tional University Sports Council
Headquarters to set up a meet
with the Japanese.

East-

International Gymnastics

West

“We hope this meet will set the
final groundwork for future
annual international gymnastics
events here at Pitt," D’Amico
said, “and open the eyes of the
community to the world of gym-
nastics competition. Men's and
women's gymnastics is a great
spectator sport.”

A meet of such a caliber as this
requires the dedication of many
people to play and promote the
event. It also requires the gener-
osity of many people to help
finance the meet. For the second
consecutive year, A.J. Noce and
Southgate Datsun are the meet's
sponsors. Additionally, Don
Bagnato, president of Suburban
Lodging lnc., will help in hous-
ing the Japanese all-stars.

“This meet would not be possi-
ble without the help ofA.J. Noce
[owner of Southgate Datsun]
and everyone who put so much
time into the preparation,”
D’Amico said.

Pittsburgh is one of the Japa-
nese all-stars’ six stops on their
United States tour. The tour
began Dec. 2 at the University of
Minnesota and will make stops
at Illinois, Northern Illinois,
Iowa State and finish Dec. l0 at
Penn State.

. for the Friday encounter. Senior

Showdown

Complete with ll gymnasts,
coaches and two Japanese
judges, this meet should prove to
be a first-class international
event.

According to D’Amico, the
Panthers are working diligently

captains Dave Smith, a three-
time All-East performer from
Butler, and Frank Katz, an All-
East performer from Ambridge,
exhibit strength and leadership
in the Panthers‘ all—around
lineup.

“I think we will break a
record,” D’Amico said, “almost
every record ever set. I think the
guys are in great shape. The gym-
nastics will be the best ever dis-
played. I won't be surprised if a
couple of 10s are given."

Also, sophomores Matt Peters
from Kiski and Mark Klafter
from Long Island, N.Y., have
both made enormous improve-
ments since last season in the all-

around event, will be key
performers for Pitt.
“Although we’re working

hard, it isn’t a serious competi-
tion," Peters remarked. “As a
team, we will like it as much as
the spectators and will learn a lot
from the Japanese."

played three of his finest games to
start the season. Pitt head coach
Roy Chipman‘ said that Allen
deserved the player-of-the-game
award against Lafayette, even
though Vaughan scored 24.

The initial signs are promising as
the Panthers gear up for their second
Big East season. Time will tell, but
the story at this juncture provides
much to be optimistic about.

By SCOTT DELLETT

The game had the ingredients for
curing insomia. Here was the Pitt
men's basketball team getting offto
a quick 2-0 start with high aspira-
tions for a successful season. The
opposition was Indiana University
of Pennsylvania, a Division II squad
rebuilding and opening this season
with two lopsided losses to West Vir-
ginia and Penn State.

Many thought all the Panthers
had to do was step into the Field
House’ and give a demonstration of
shake-and-bake .roundball. But
those 4,7l3 fans who witnessed the
first half were in fora shock.

Pitt was only ahead 33-26 at inter-
mission, and when IUP guard
Chuck Collins hit a spinningjump to
cut Pitt‘s lead to five, doubts entered
the minds of the blue and gold’s

‘faithful.

But a man-to-man pressure
defense and the passing acrobatics
of freshman guard Curtis Aiken
turned the game into the scrimmage
it should have been; the Panthers
routed the Big Indians 86-54 on Sat-
urday night.

Aiken‘was the catalyst of Pitt‘s
I3-point spurt, which turned an
interesting game into little more
than a pick-up match. The 5-ll
guard from Buffalo, N.Y., electrified

the crowd with his passing game.

The pass that woke up the silent
Field House gathering came from
the top of the key. Aiken whipped
the ball with his left hand behind his
back, ripping the ball in the direc-
tion of George Allen in the right
corner. Allen coolly swished a 17-
foot jumper as the crowd roared in
disbelief. Later, Aiken threw a cross-
court underhand toss that found
Clyde Vaughan headed for the
basket at the other end, and the 6-4
forward placed the ball softly off the
glass.

“I think the crowd loves to see the
freshman play with poise,” said
Allen, whose rousing two-handed
dunk off a steal was the highlight of
the first half. “When the game gets
boring, that really helps.”

Peters Figures To
Be Key For Pitt

By LISA GRENEVICKI

Last year, Matt Peters came to

Pitt as the Pennsylvania State All-
Around Gymnastics Champion. He
has continued his successful gym-
nastics and begins his second season
as a Panther when the Japanese All-
Star team invades the Field House
Friday at 8 p.m.

Peters is one of the top all-around
performers for this year’s Pitt squad.
He is eagerly anticipating his second
international meet in as many years.

“I am really looking forward to
thedapanese meet,” Peters said. “It’s
very different competing against
teams like them. We’re used to com-
peting against others who are on our
level and watching teams like the
Japanese on TV. There's nothing
like seeing them in person. 111 bejust
as entertained with the Japanese as
the spectators. l’ll be learning from
them as I watch.”

Peters is always thinking ahead.
An athlete relies on his physical abil-
ities to make him successful. Peters
has just that, with incredible ﬂexibil-
ity in his upper body. But the mental
preparation in Peters is what makes
him one of the best.

“Matt has the most potential of
anyone on our team,” said assistant
coach Joe Femiani. “He has great
physical control. He listens and is
very attentive. What’s most impor-
tant is that he can apply what we tell
him. He is an intelligent gymnast.”

“The physical involvement is only
half of it,“ Peters said. “You have to
step back and look at what you are
doing. The moves I am doing this
year, I was thinking about last year,
and I'm already thinking about what
I want to do next year. I like to
analyze what I am going to do on an
apparatus before I do it.”

Twenty minutes elapsed after
Saturday’s scheduled tipoff between
Pitt and Central State before a pair
of referees were ﬁnally rounded up
for the women‘s basketball game at

-the Field House.

During the 20 minutes following
initial play, those in attendance
wondered when the home team
would really begin to play.

It was not Central State's intensity
that produced a 4 l -30 halftime score
but Pitt‘s lack of intensity. An ll-
point advantage appears comforta-
ble enough on the surface, but it was
disappointing considering that the
Lady Marauders are not high-
caliber material.

That became all the more obvious
in the second half when the Lady

The Pitt News, Monday, December 5, I983

Lady Panthers Surmount Early Lethargy

Panthers put on the performance
responsible for a queen-size blowout
as Pitt hiked its record to 3-0 in its
95-46 victory.

Sharpshooter Jennifer Bruce
went eight for l8 from the field and
I2 of I4 from the foul line to put her
four-game output at lll points. The
6-0 junior and tri-captain kept her
27.7 ppg production intact with 28
points and seven rebounds Saturday
night.

Bruce was not Pitt’s only offensive
weapon, though; three other Lady
Panthers scored in double digits.

“Every player on our team is a
scorer," said head coach Judy
Saurer, whose revolving player sys-
tem is often difficult to track. Every
player experienced nearly a quarter
of court time against Central State.

Freshman center Julie Callan
resembled a veteran, scoring a point
almost every minute she played. The
6-l Chicagoan chalked up 2| points
in one 24-minute span and pulled
down seven rebounds.

Also hitting double digits were
junior tri-captain Stephanie Collins
(I2) and sophomore guard Kim
Gannis (I4), whose two free throws
give her the team‘s highest free-
throw percentage at nine of IO this
season.

With eight assists, sophomore
guard Kim Tirik again leads the way
with 28 this season. The signal—caller
emerged tops on the team last season
with ll6.

Leading the Lady Panthers in
rebounds was sophomore Lisa

“I was not pleased with our
rebounding." Saurer said, “espe-
cially in the first half. When we went
in at halftime, I told them to be
aggressive and intimidating on
defense and rebounding. And they
did, breaking and getting the ball up
the court in the second half.

“Each one of them had to go in
full steam ahead, and they realized
that.“

The Lady Panthers indeed took
heed and steamrolled Central State
in the game’s second half. Pitt tallied
54 points and on the strength of its
rebounding, denied the Lady
Marauders any respectability; the
travellers could only muster l6
points in the final §_minutes.

PetersFigures To
_ Be Key For Pitt

So far, Peters‘ thinking has paid
off. With parallel and high bar being
his favorite events, he is currently
iivorking on several new moves, one
of which is a one arm giant on the
high bar. He plans to use this move
in his routine" against the Japanese.

“Matt has a lot of untapped tal-
ent." Femiani said. “He is doing
moves no one else on the team is
doing. He still hasn't peaked, and
he‘s only a sophomore.”

Peters has been involved in gym-
nastics since elementary school,
where Jerry Cernicki. an assistant
gymnastics coach at Kiski High
School, discovered his athletic abili-
ties. Peters began competing in
ninth grade at Kiski.

“Sometimes, I wonder why I do
it,“ Peters said. “It seems crazy, but
it all pays off when you hit on a
routine. lf you don’t mess up and do
the job in front of the crowd, it's a
good feeling.”

The Panthers are set for a tough
season ahead. It doesn’t get any eas-
ier after they take on the Japanese,
but Peters is cool—headed about it
all.

“I really don‘t feel any pressure,”
Peters remarked. “I do what I can
do. The key for me this season is to
stay calm and relaxed. Any tension,
and you can‘t swing freely on a rou-
tine. It can really mess you up. In the
gym [practice], there is no pressure.
You go for it -— you’re not conserva-
tive. But in a meet, you become con-
servative and just want to perform a
clean routine. I want to relax during
the meets and go for it then, too."
_, Throughout his
career, Peters has accomplished a
lot. With three seasons left as a
Panther, his future looks just as
promising as his past.

“Matt can be one of the two top
all-around performers on the team
this year," Femiani said. “We‘re
looking for him to make nationals in
one or two events."

“l set short—term goals for myself
because they're easier to reach."

‘mostof the guys on the team. But

The Pitt News, Monday, December 5, I983

Page 15

Peters added. “Going to Nationals is
one of those goals for me now. Sure,
l‘d like to go this year, but l’m in no
hurry. l have other chances to make
it there. Right now, the season and
the Japanese meet are what's impor-
tant. But like I said before, I’m
always thinking ahead.”

Peters has comfortably made the
adjustment from high school to col-
lege gymnastics, without losing the
winning edge.

“in high school it‘s mostly fun and
games," Peters said. “You work, but
in college, it’s more serious. When I
came to Pitt I felt I was an all right
gymnast. l‘d come here and be like

when I got here, I saw what the oth-
ers could do. They were incredible.
It was like starting all over again.
Going into my second year, l feel l‘m
finally starting to do something for
the team."

Peters is doing just that and will
get the chance to strut his stuff on
Friday, when a touch of interna-
tional gymnastics comes to Pitts-
burgh once again.

C /er Nash Pto

The goal ofqualifying for nation-
als was left unfulfilled, but the Pitt
women‘s swim team still came up
with several stand out performances
as the Lady Panthers finished fourth
in the Penn State Relays held last
Friday and Saturday.

The 200-yard medley relay squad
of Susan Hickman, Tracy Pfisfer,
Wendy Morgan and Nordiene Bur-
rell won the event with a time of
l:49.56. only one one-hundredth of
a second ahead of the second-place
Penn State relay.

“You can't get any closer than
that,“ Lady Panther coach David
Belowich said. “Susan was behind
when she started her split. and when

have a chance to catch up.

"But Susan made up the distance
and had a great finish. One-one-
hundredths ofa second is a matter of
inches. lt was pretty exciting.“

The rest of the two—day meet was
not as thrilling nor as productive for
Pitt, as the 200-yard medley relay
was the only event the Lady Panth-
ers won. Still. Belowich was pleased
with the team‘s performance.“Over-
all. we had a pretty good meet." he
said. “The first three dual meets were
not as tough as we anticipated. It
was a good situation to get the team
in competition that is more indictive
of the championship’s competition
at the end of the season.“

The Lady Panther‘s divers supp-
lied the next highest finish when the
team of Tricia Schultz and Jennifer

Brown took second place in the
three-meter board. The two com-
bined for a fifth spot in the one-
meter event. Pitt generally finished

Texas A&M were diminished to
nothing.

“There were more disqualifica-
tions than l have ever seen in a
meet.“ Belowich said. "Either the
officals were on top of the calls or
there were more mistakes."

After final exams. the team will
take a trip to the sunny. tropical cli-
mate of Puerto Rico. The lady
Panthers. however. will not concen-
trate on getting tans; the concern
will be on training.

Pitt will put in l()0.()()() meters of
swimming in a ten-day period.

“This training is necessary." Belo-
wich said. “Good things will happen
from it. We are in good condition
now. but after the trip we'll be in
better shape.“ The change ofscenery
will help build 21 better attitude for
these intense workouts.

“The environment affects the
mental environment.“ Belowich
said. “With this type of weather. we
are able to train outdoors in a 50-
meter pool. The girls are paying for
this trip themselves.“

Its a high price to pay for this type
oftraining. but in March. the results
should show.

1983 Not Quite
Fulfilling For

Spikers,

By LAURIE KUBLI

Volleyball has the distinction of
possessing what may well be the
sporting world‘s shortest season.
spanning a period less than half the
length of many other collegiate
sports.

For two and a half months. Pitt
women‘s volleyball coach Shelton
Collier guided his squad of IO play-
ers through 42 matches, savoring a
12-0 start and sniffing the roses mid-
way through, when the team had
garnered l9 wins against a mere two
losses.

Collier also saw his charges suffer
through injuries and mental let-
downs, noting their precarious
search for identity and leadership.

The spikers' season ended less
than two weeks ago —- prematurely,
if one adheres to the expectations of
Collier, his athletes and rival
coaches as well —— coming to an
abrupt halt at the Big East Cham-
pionships in Providence, R.I.

“It was a challenging year without
the luxury of senior leadership,"
Collier observed. “Many times, our

leadership alternated between jun-

iors, sophmores and even freshmen
almost as ifthey were taking turns

being the senior.“ .

One sophomore upon whom the
team often depended for shepherd-
ing was outside hitter Sally Gilles-
pie. The 5-7 Norwin graduate noted
that it was a season in which the
team learned several important
things.

“We learned what we have to do
to win," Gillespie explained. “Meet-
ing short-term goals is the key to
long-term goals. We should go into
matches hoping everything would
click. If it clicked, we rolled, but we

didn‘t have the confidence of’

experience."

The Lady Panthers rolled through
much oftheir competition but failed
to hurdle two important obstacles.
One, of course, was the season-
ending loss to host Providence in the
Big East finals. The second occurred
midway through the season, after
nearly a month of success on the
road.

“Curtis has a lot of confidence;
you can tell just ta1king_to him,"
Vaughan. whose 29 points were
almost taken for granted. said. “The
key to being good is to have
confidence.”

Pitt head coach Roy Chipman,
however, described Aiken’s play
with more reserve. The fourth—year
coach mentioned that Aiken
suprlstld even his teammates with his
sideshow. as demonstrated by center
Steve Beatty. who was so shocked in
getting a pass by Aiken —-- where the
freshman went left and the ball went
right that he missed an easy
laYUP-  . .

“Curtis is an exciting player."
Chipman said. “but he has to get his
shooting along with his passing. I'm
afraid to get him with George; they
might try to outdo each other. I
think hes got to reali7e teams will
come at him. He has to be more
aggressive."

Aiken also has to contend with
incumbent Billy Culbertson. With
less glitter. the 6-1 senior dished out
five assists and made three steals.

“Curtis has a tough guy to beat
out in Billy.“ Chipman said.

“Billyjust goes out there and gets
the job done," Vaughan said.

‘Fortunately, there’s no problems
with this rivalry —- a confident and
sometimes cocky freshman going
after the seasoned veteran.

“Basically, we battle every day in
practice," Culbertson said. “But we
help each other out, also.“

The second factor in turning a
close game into a riot later than nor-
mal was the change in defensive stra-
tegy during intermission.

“We went from a zone to man-to-
man,” Culbertson said. “That’s what
broke them down.”

“For five minutes, their quickness
got to us and took its toll," Indiana
coach Tom Beck said. “They closed
off the passing lanes.”

And that was the end for the Big
Indians. who were tenative on
offense from the start, as evidenced
by the I6 turnovers in the first half
and the number of shots taken (17).

But Indiana stayed in the game.
The Panthers only shot 40.6 percent
in the opening half. getting the lead
up to 14 with three minutes to go,
only to have it cut by half.

“The turnovers were the differ-
ence in the first half," Beck said. “We
out-rebounded Pitt in the first half
because the kids played gutsy bas-
ketball."

        
  

t« Eastman Kodak Company, 1983

“They scored a couple baskets and
gained confidence,“ Vaughan said.
“They said to themselves. ‘Hey, we
can play with Pitt.’ When you have
confidence. you can play with
anyone."

Despite the on-again, off-again
play in the last two games. Pitt has
gained confidence with its three-
game winning streak. a rarity with
the Panthers, considering their
starts the last three years.

“In my first year. it was a new
coach with a new system," Chipman
said. “The second year, we had a
young team. and the third year. we
lost three starters. This is the first
time we had 10 out of the first ll
players back."

And the results are starting to
show.

“With the guards and Vaughan,

Pitt is dominating,“ Beck said. “If
they had a big man, they would have
a helluva team."
GAME NOTES: Indiana forward
Dave Beck, the coach’s son, led the
Big Indians with 10 points and six
rebounds....In a reversal of the first
half, Pitt shot 62.5 percent from the
floor while Indiana hit only seven of
24 (29.3 percent)....IUP entered the
game without a player scoring in
double figures.

championships; the Lady Panthers
finished in second place due to
sloppy performances against unher-
alded opposition.

l he following weekend. however.
the team travelled to the Tennessee
Classic. also winding up second. but
against much stiffer competition.
Pitt defeated two strong "Texas
schools and the ACC champion.
North Carolina.

llie ever—buoyant Collier never
lost laith. and his players seldom
hesitated to justify his confidence in
them.

"I have certainly had more suc-
cesslul teams in my career. but this is
niy lav orite group of players by far."
Collier said. “il hey are mature. per-
gcptive and great to work with. l
haxe a great deal of faith in them.
and l have a lot of faith in their

ability."

‘A noteworthy performance: the
Pitt squad defeated lFth—ranked
Florida State one of the Semi-
noles‘ two losses. The spikers
accomplished that feat without the
services of first-team All-Big East
selection Judy Young. one of the
team's two setters.

The very next morning. setter
Cathy Rupp suffered a freak injury
to her ankle in the warm—up for the
Louisville match. which, along with
Young‘s nagging injury, precipitated
a hard-fought loss to arch—rival
Penn State that night.

Rupp. a 5-8 transfer from ()hio
U.. maintained that the team peaked
at the beginning of the season and
again near the end.

“Next year. we won‘t hav eto learn
the way we had to this year. with two
new setters and no seniors." Rupp

said. “I had a lot ofdifficulty apply-
ing immediate goals to long-term
goals. and I think the team as a
whole did.

“We will each be tested in the off-
season. We may be a whole new
team. but whoever's here will be
ready for next year."

Collier does not believe he will
have a whole new squad. but he said
that he "will be doing no recruiting
of blue—chip recruits. particularly in
Western Pa.. one of the hottest tal-
ent spots in the nation" for
volleyball.

Collier will probably increase his
roster by two to the normal I2-
pla_ver limit. but he is content with
his current personnel. “I am confi-
dent that next year we will be a fac-
tor on the national volleyball scene."

Pitt displayed stunning tenacity

country. and seventh-ranked
Purdue. forcing both powerhouses
to five games on the Boilermakers‘
own turf at the Purdue Classic.

Pitt was again the dominant team
in the Big East. smashing conference
rivals Villanova. Seton Hall and
(ieorgetown midway through the
season at the Southern [)ivision
tournament.

Iixpeeted to repeat as conference
champs by the Big Iiast seeding
panel ofcoaches. the l.ady Panthers
dominated the championships up
until the final.

Pitt defeated Boston College. Cin-
cinnati and Villanova in round robin
play and then flattened Syracuse in
the semifinal. going so far as to shut-
out the ()rangewomen I54) in the
first game.

“I was extremely proud of my
team throughout the tournament."

Collier said. “We played each match
ver_v well and very seriously and
upheld a first-class image
throughout."

Now. the team will begin prepara-
tion for its next season. According
to Collier. the January-April train-
ing slot is his team's “pre-season."

“I think some ofus are still hoping
we'll wake up and find it [the season
loss to Providence] was only a night-
mare.“ he remarked. “l'psets
happen everyday in every sport
it's exciting but tough to deal with
when you're on the wrong end.

“I can guarantee we will be much
more prepared next year." Collier
said. “My goal is to improve to the
extent that we can play Providence
in Providence with one oftheir play-
ers refereeing and still dominate the
match. We have a lot ofwork to do,"

Do the Commuters—87% of Pitt’s Population——Care?

by Greg Petro

Many people speak of the
problems of commuters.
Some say that they don’t
have the programs and servi-
ces available to them as the
resident students do. Others
say that the commuters do
not have social programs that
tie them to the campus social
life. Many solutions are
offered to these dilemas and
quite a bit of time and money
is invested and still these peo-
ple do not see the situation
change. Why? There are
many answers to this ques-
tion. One is that these servi-
ces and programs are not
designed in a way in which a
poll can be taken to see how
much the students have
benefitted from them. The
other point of view is that
these programs are not
benefitting the students at all,
or many just don't care.

As the Vice-President of
the Commuter Association, I
have seen many programs
from start to finish, many
with the same outcome, fail-
ure. Failure, not in the sense
that the programs were not
designed or thought through
well enough, but failure in the
sense that nobody cared to
participate. Once again it

comes down to the question
of why? Why doesn’t 87% of
the undergraduate popula-
tion at the University of Pitts-
burgh want to help
themselves to services we
offer them?
It is my conviction that it’s
not because they are all apa-
thetic, sure some may be, it’s
not because the programs
don’t interest them, some
don’t. So what could it be? I
believe it is a stigma that has
been connected with the
word, commuter. It’s this
stigma that has hindered the
commuters from forming a
cohesive organization much
like that of the RSA. This
stigma that I
speaking of has been around
for years. It is the idea that all
commuters live at home with
their parents, just go to and
from classes, and have their
social life at home with their
old high school friends. Sure
some students may do that,
but that is their choice; how-
ever, that does not mean that
every commuter follows that
pattern. The 87% of the stu-
dents classified as commu-
ters consist of all students
who don’t reside in the resi-
dent halls. This includes off-

have been ‘

campus housed students,
fraternity housed students,
and the students that live at
home.

Much of this problem
stems from the belief that'col-
lege means freedom. Free-
dom from parents, home, et
al. I believe that each situa-
tion has a benefit all its own. I
feel that if the students realize
that it really doesn’t matter
where you live or with whom
you live that many of the
problems of commuters will
be solved. Why? Because the
first and foremost problem is
having the students realize
that they are commuters. It is
easy to differentiate a resi-
dent hall student because of
their housing and close prox-
imity to one another. How-
ever, with the commuters
and their diversity it is diffi-
cult. Therefore, providing
services and programs to.
address their needs is even
more difficult.

Hopefully, through help
from the Administration, Stu-
dent Government, the RSA,

and the Commuters the

Commuter Association will
be able to clarify and address
the commuters needs.

Commuter President Beats Stress!

by Marcia Anstanaig

Are you feeling like you’re

under a lot of pressure from

school work, finals, extracur-

ricular activities, and perhaps

a part-time job PLUS the ever

so unpopular commuting
routine? ME TOO! At least I

did feel that way about four
weeks ago. Now, I feel some
of the pressure but I’m much
more relaxed. My secret is
really no secret at all. I partici-
pated in the free stress-
workshop offered by Pitt’s
Student Health Education
Services. Perhaps you
noticed an advertisement
about it in the Pitt News. Dur-
ing a 4 to 5 week program,
you schedule one half hour,
‘personal meeting per week
with Linda Thompson in
South Holland Hall. Ms.
Thompson is well-trained to
teach you all there is to know
about stress and its effects. I
was surprised to find out how
many people participate in
the stress workshop because
I felt I was the only one on
campus who needed to learn
relaxation techniques.

Ms. Thompson taught me
how to be in the middle of a
mass of paperwork and dead-
lines and be totally calm and
relaxed. The stress-
workshop will not rid anyone
of their responsibilities yet

present Torture Garden & Maniac

the program probably will
make participants feel less
pressured by them. The only
thing that I am sorry about is
that I did not take the work-
shop sooner. However, it is
always offered and the
rewards are almost always
the same. Do you think that a
stigma is attached to some-
one walking into the Health
Education Center? Well,
even if you have the slightest
doubts, let me assure you
that everyone working in the
center and everyone who
takes advantage of its servi-
ces is quite normal. In fact,
those who use the service are
healthy people who just want
to learn more about making
themselves better-off. In a
way, by completing the stress
workshop, I feel much more
in control of all of my work
and I am able to do it with
much more ease. I went in
“almost” a perfectly healthy
specimen and walked out
even better. I also had fun
doing it!

If I talked you into trying
the stress—workshop or even
if you are just curious about it
for yourself or for your stu-
dent organization, please feel
free to give Linda Thompson
a call at 624-5244. You’ll be
glad you did!
