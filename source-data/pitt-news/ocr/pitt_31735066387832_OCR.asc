§United Faculty awaits ruling on managerial status

i Byjennifer Calabrese
ForThe Pitt News


i
I Two key questions in the 7-year-old
struggle between Pitt administration and

the United Faculty over collective ’

representation will be ruled on this fall by
the State Labor Board.

The main point at issue is whether the
full-time faculty should be considered
managers or employees of the university.

 If the faculty are found to be managers,

they will not be allowed to hold an
election for union representation.

“What makes a manager is the authority
to make decisions. The faculty here don’t
make decisions. We 0 do make
recommendations about curriculum and

other matters, but the administration makes
the ﬁnal call,” said English professor
Philip Wion, president of UP.

University Counsel Lewis Popper
pointed at a different distinction between
a manager and an employee.

“The test is [this]: Does the faculty make
recommendations that are usually
followed?  The answer from the hearing
examiner was an unequivocal yes,” Popper
said.

In March 1987, the hearing examiner of
the labor board ruled that faculty were to
be considered managers. The decision
was partially based on a U.S. Supreme
Court case in 1980 involving the faculty at
Yeshiva University. The court ruled that
faculty at Yeshiva were managers and

therefore could not unionize.

“The Yeshiva case does not apply to us.
That was a private university and complies
to the federal laws. Pitt is public and falls
under state law,” Wion said.

In that same decision, the hearing
examiner ruled that since the medical
school faculty already had a union, it
could be considered separate from regular
faculty and therefore could be allowed to
remain unionized. That whole decision
was appealed and is currently being ruled
on by the entire labor board.

The administration disagreed with that
part of his decision regarding the medical
faculty, and according to Wion, it has been
trying to have their union decertiﬁed on
the basis that they are inactive. They

maintain that all faculty should be
considered as one unit.

“This is one university, and it has one
faculty,” Popper said.

These issues have been of concern
since 1976, when the medical school faculty
voted for a union and the rest of the faculty
voted against it. Wion said the settlement
of these questions has not come easily or
cheaply.

“The administration has spent over
$500,000 in outside legal fees in this
matter. That’s state and student tuition
funds being used to try to stop a legitimate
democratic process,” Wion said.

Popper said that although university
funds (which are comprised mainly of

SGB plans
modiﬁcation
of election
recount
process

. By  M. Hall
For The Pitt News

Upcoming modifications of the
Student Government Board's
election code, including the
recount procedure, were
discussed Wednesday at the first
SGB meeting of the Fall Term.

Two different procedures are

currently listed in two key sections
of the code for when a candidate
has I sufﬁcient reason to be
dissatisﬁed with,the outcome of
an election. This variation could
be easily remedied, explained
Elections Committee chairwoman
Nicole Vitale, by the removal of
‘Part’ G which states, “The
candidate must petition for a
recount in writing within one
business day after the [Student
Government Elections
Comrnitteel posts final results.”

However, in Article IV, Judicial
Procedures, Sections II and III,
the candidate is required to
“submit written. charges to the

Poet ponders Celebration of the Human Straggle’ daring Pitt visit

By Chantal Evans
and Shelena Rauscher
For The Pitt News

The therapeutic nature of poetry was

discussed by b.f. maiz, poet and lecturer,

. )who held a recitation and discussion last
Thursday, Sept. 14, in the lower lounge of
the William Pitt Union.

“The magic and mystery come together
at some point to create the miracle of
poetry,” maiz said. “Thus all good poetry
is therapeutic and all good therapy must
' e poetic.”

 presentation, entitled “Celebration

of the Human Struggle” was part of the
“Celebrate Diversity” festivities. He began
with a brief introduction by launching into
a discussion of his background.

He said that he had an interest in poetry
early in his childhood. At the “young age
of four” maiz began reading, and he was
writing his own verses at ﬁve. Presently
he has written over 1,000 poems.

He cited the poet e.e. cummings, as a
“definite inﬂuence.” He said that his
appreciation of curnmings is one of the
reasons he keeps his name, Broxi
Franchon, initialed in lower case.

A graduate of the University of

Minnesota, maiz said he had a great respect
for education and admiration for those
who wrote. This contributed to his
involvement in the literacy program at
Cuyough Community College, where he
designs programs for reading with a biblical
message.

Along with each poem he offered an
explanation of its meaning. His recitation
included his favorite work, ‘Arthur, Bear
and Stone,’ poems about his mother, and
a special selection he wrote for Janis
Joplin titled “On a Lady Who Sang in
Overjoy.”

He said that he can not imagine doing

anything else. “[Al poet isn’t something
you are, its something you do.”

Presently he lives in Braternahl, Ohio,
with his wife and daughter. A new book,
Some Winter Words, may be published in
November.

The program ended with maiz
autographing copies of his poem “Holy
September Sabbath Morning”

A Pitt student present at the lecture,
Chris Moleski, said, ‘I have never been so
interested in a speaker. I have seen him
before and I came back again to hear
him’

’C‘/aoice

 Dollars’

lauded

By Sandra Kramer

' E Staff Writer

The new Choice Dollars meal
plan, which allows students to
in local
restaurants with the use of a
student I.D., has gained
momentum as many students
invest in the plan.

According to Mike McCarthy, a

A staff member in the Meal Ticket

office in the Towers Lobby, “A lot
of students switched their meal
plans and purchased Choice
Dollars during Meal Plan Change
Week.”

Gale Jackson, a cashier at the
Schenley Cafe, a restaurant on
the plan, called the plan
successful: “The system is easy to
use. It’s a. good addition as far as
students go.” She added that there

was a big increase in business of

both cash and Choice Dollars
purchasers.

According to a letter printed by
the Housing and Food Service,
“Choice Dollars is the term for
the new declining balance
addition to the University Meal

Plan system. The new system A

I I makes it possible for students to

use their university photo I.D. .

cards at various campus dining
areas to purchase food on a per—
item basis.”

Choice Dollars can be used at
the Schenley Cafe in the William
Pitt Union, Roy Rogers in the
Cathedral of Learning, Second
Plate in Forbes Quadrangleand
in the boarding cafeterias by
purchasing meal tickets at the
Towers Desk.

The Choice Dollars program
allows the student to purchase

sgjhe plan alone or as a supplement

to a regular meal plan in
denominations of $50. Choice
Dollars not used at the end of ‘the
Fall Term can be carried over to
the Winter Term.

chairperson of the SGEC within
one business day after the
occurrence.”

This discrepancy was brought
to the attention of Vitale by SGB

~ adviser Joyce Giangarlo before

the Wednesday meeting.
Giangarlo stressed the need for
more definitive regulations for
recounts because “you can’t just
recount on a request basis."
The decision was then made to
request the removal of Part G

from the code. The motion was

tabled by board member Elissa

Klein who felt that the Elections

Committee needed more time to

discuss any changes in the code,
especially those regarding the
recounting of votes, which has
occurred only once before.

“Those instances where you
might want a recount are so rare.
If an election is very, very close,
the Elections Committee will
basically take it upon themselves
to double check, triple check the
count just to make sure that it was
accurate,” commented Julie
Shepard.

That was the case last year

when Shepard defeated C. Harper
Watters by one point.

Giangarlo said she remembers
her initial surprise at the results of
the final tally that night. “Luke
[Klucho, graduate assistant of
Student Activities,l_and I came up
with a number and said, ‘Oh
God!’” '

The votes for Shepard and
Watters were then retabulated
twice with the same results.
Giangarlo attributed her faith in
the accuracy of these numbers in
the current tallying system that

she instituted last year. Calculators
were added to insure that none
of the votes were miscounted
when the Elections Committee
tallied the results after the election,
a process that lasts into the early
hours of the following day.

As for the success of the code
itself, Vitale speculates that last
spring, Tara Guseman [Elections
Committee chair at the time]
made changes in the code that
may have included the recount
procedure. Guseman was
unavailable for comment.

  Life vs. tbe right to bear arms

On Saturday, black was the color in vogue in Louisville,

- as family and friends gathered to mourn the loss of James

Wible. ,

Wible was one of the seven people killed when Joseph
T. Wesbecker, a highly unstable co-worker, entered the
Standard-Gravure Co. and opened fire on his unsuspect-
ing‘fel.low workers. ,

Wesbecker had intended to hunt down his bosses and
supervisors, but he was unable to locate them and
decided to shoot the people that he could find —— the other
workers at the plant. ,

Wesbecker had been collecting guns the way that some
people collect stamps. In his personal collection, he had
such goodies as an AK-47 semiautomatic riﬂe, two MAC
11 machine pistols, a .38—caliber handgun, a 9mm pistol

' and thousands of rounds of ammunition.

Where could a man with a history of rnanic-depression
have obtained such a diverse collection of weapons?

Although it is not clear where Wesbecker bought the
guns, it is painfully clear that he was not asked too many
questions before he was permitted to walk through the
door with an armful of extremely powerful ﬁrearms.

This is the second mass murder that has occurred in less
than a year. In January, a madman opened fire in a
California school yard, injuring 30 people and killing five
children. A .

If the government would call for stricter control on the
sale of such weapons, madmen like these could never
have created the bloodbaths they did.

First of all, no matter what some say, the “right to bear
arms” does not mean that theaverage American citizen
needs to be able to purchase rapid-fire weapons like the
ones used by Wesbecker. Tragedies such as these prove
that there should be a substantial waiting period before

- anyone can purchase a gun — and sale should be denied

to anyone who has a criminal record or a history of mental
illness.

It is time to stop the murder of innocent people by
psychotic killers who many times turn the gun on
themselves in the end. Why should potential murderers

— have easy access to such powerful weapons just so

another person can protect his right to own almost any
type of gun he desires? I

The right to live is much more fundamental than the
right to bear arms.

Must we do business with China?

Some ﬁerce remarks have been
made concerning a recent article
in The Washington Postby Henry
Kissinger, President Nixon's for-
mer secretary of state. In light of
the subdued aftermath of the
Tiananmen Square massacre,
Kissinger’s article basically stated
that it is vital for the United States
to return to normalcy with the
Chinese government and to keep

congenial economic and diplo-
matic ties.

Of course, much of the media
is outraged over the Kissinger ar-
ticle, which they contend is an
apology for the brutal actions of
the Chinese government sparked
by the former secretary’s own
financially parochial interests.
Granted, Mr. Kissingefs judgment
on this issue might be more cred-
ible if he didn't have investments
and connections in China, but
the man does have a valid point.

The reason Nixon opened the
doors to China wasn’t because he
thought that Mao Tse-tung and

. Chinese communists were nice

or neat or cool, or even that
China had prettier women than
the Soviet Union (although they
probably do). He did it for two
very crucial reasons: economics
and a U.S.-Chinese common
enemy — the Soviet Union. Even
more important is the fact that
Mao ordered more murders of
Chinese than Deng Xiaoping
could shake an AK-47 at -— the
United States knew that when
Nixon made the trip.

In his book, 1999: Victory With-
out War, Nixon wrote: “We must
continue to cultivate the relation-
ship between the United States
and China, focusing primarily on
economic and political" coopera-
tion, and following up with mili-
tary and strategic cooperation
where possible.” Signiﬁcantly, he

-wrote that a year before Deng

Xiaoping’s Tiananmen bloodshed

which he has since referred to (in . I
typical Nixonese) as "stupid," but I

the primary reasoning behind that
statement is still quite logical and
hasn't changed.

Now don’t get me wrong. I’m
definitely not condoning the
actions of the Chinese govern-
ment. And Deng doesn’t have my
sympathy for his inevitable
postmortem Molotov cocktail
parties in Hellﬁwith Hitler and the
Ayatollah ‘—-besides, I’m sure his
grief will be well-compensated

down there in delightful conver- .

sations on collectivized agricul-
ture, suppression and mass

« slaughter with Karl Marx and Joe

Stalin. But the sad fact for the
United States is that sometimes
you must deal with vermin like
Deng to keep stability and peace.

The media's shock over Kissin-
ger’s call for normalcy was also
voiced by the U.S. Congress, due
to the Chinese govemment’s
brutal actions against the stu-
dents. But why the shock? They
seem surprised that a group of
Chinese militant BenedictArnolds
under order of ruthless, octoge-
narian, Marxist barbarians from
within the Chinese Politburo
would shoot defenseless students.
C'mon folks —— as columnist
Charley Reese wrote, “This is a
government that established it-
self by murdering millions of
Chinese. A few thousand more is
[a] pittance.”

The views of the media and
Congress contradict Kissinger.
They still want Bush, via eco-
nornic sanctions, to send a signal
of disapproval to the Chinese

government for the slaughter. The
Chinese government knows we
disapprove of the massacre —
we don’t have to send signals to
tell it that. Besides, it doesn’t care!
The president was right: eco-
nomic sanctions against the
governments won't accomplish
anything and will just hurt the
Chinese people (and U.S. busi-
ness). The Chinese government
will merely get the money back
by lowering the ceiling on pri-
vate incomes.(a Marxist favorite),
increasing the profit percentage
“granted” to them by private
incomes (another Marxist favor-
ite), taking it from the peasants,
or by doing what any other dis-
graced communist country does
— deal with West Germany. It
has already stated that Chinese
college students will now spends?-
a mandatory two years working
on farms for culturing (i.e., gov-
ernment ﬁnancial) purposes.

Basically, the only way we can
help establish a successful de- -
mocracy in China is to: 1. Relent-
lessly bomb the country and let
/our advisers help the students
install a peaceful democracy, or
2. Allow Lt. Col. Oliver North and
Adm. John Poindexter to covertly
ship arms to the student move-
ment. Neither suggestion is popuéﬂ
lar nor advisable. The pro-de-
mocracy demonstrators have the
sympathy of Patrick Henry, Lady
Liberty and myself— but without
arms the student movement is
dead, and all our sympathy and
outrage is in vain.

So that’s the way it is and will
always be in China: ruthless
communism and brutal suppres- 3
sion. Unfortunately, Kissinger is
right, and we have no choice but
to grit our teeth and bear it. A few
words of advice to President Bush-
excellent job so far, sir, but re-
member to hold your nose the
next time you shake Deng’s handg

Pitt soccer team splits with St. Francis, Pa. and Bucknell

Byseanlieilman

~ For the Pitt News

The Pitt soccer team completed a season
opening four-game home stand by
splitting a pair of games last week,
moving their record to 3-1.

On Wednesday, Pitt used some late
game dramatics to defeat St. Francis, Pa.,
2-1.

With the clock showing less than 10
minutes and the score tied at one, Pitt
began to pressure the St. Francis goal,

As a result, the Panthers received an
abundant supply of corner kicks.
Panthers were finally able to

The

 
  
  

convert when Mark Brehm tapped a J.R.
Perdue corner kick across the goal line
with four minutes remaining.
V Brehm was quick to praise the passer.
“It was all J. R.,” said Brehm. “He put
the ball where it had to be. It just
skimmed off my foot. Perfect! [Perdue]
did all the work."
Perdue countered with some praise of
his own. ’
“[Brehm] did a good job of getting to
the ball.”
The first Panther goal was scored by
Perdue with 15 minutes left in the first

' half.

Panther defender Heinz Pak lifted a

direct kick from outside the penalty area
onto Perdue’s head and into the goal.

Perdue was able to sneak in behind
the ‘St. Francis defenders so he could
head the fiall withrlo interference.

“He sent a great pass over the
defenders," said Perdue.

St. Francis tallied their only goal 12
minutes into the second half off a direct
kick.

St. Francis forward Chuck Chupien set
the ball on the turf for a restart 25 yards
from the goal. As his players were
scrambling for position to crash the net,
Chupien- saw an open goal.

Panther goalie Tim Sobelman was

Pitt's attacking middleﬂelder Mike Blatz (9) has been attracting a lot of attention lately from his opponents.

slightly out of position as he was trying
to align his defenders.

“The near post wasn’t covered,” said
Sobelman. “I probably should have
covered the other post, but I thought it
was covered. I still should have been
there. I should have blocked it. I was
caught by surprise.”

It was the cheap goal St. Francis needed
to gain confidence against a tougher Pitt
team, who outshot St. Francis 17-1.

Coach Joe Luxbacher lauded his team
for a great effort

“We kept working and working. We
played very disciplined soccer, and it

As with any sport, if a team
has a respected scorer, the
defense will almost always try
to stop that player from scoring.
Most often this will be done by
closely guarding that player all
over the ﬁeld.

The Pitt soccer team's
has been marked tightly all
season, and expects the trend to
continue.

“If I’m shut down, I try to give
the ball up so that my teammates
can go to the goal,” said Blatz. “I
try to distribute the ball so we
can score. By doing this I create
scoring opportunities for them.”

Blatz also tries to create
opportunities by moving without
the ball. For example, in a play
against St. Francis, Pa., Blatz
stole the ball near midﬁeld,
turned and passed the ball to
Mark Mostinckx on the right
side of the field. Blatz then ran
toward the left post. The defense
shifted to cover Blatz, which
opened up a lane for Ivan Amayo
to get off a shot from the right
side of the penalty box, from a

week, ESPN’s
Gameday featured a 10-minute
spot where former Redskins QB
Joe Theisman interviewed a “drug
free" Lawrence Taylor.

Taylor discussed all of his
accomplishments in fighting his
drug addiction, including therapy,
testing three times a week and
having to make the ever “difficult”
choice of either staying on drugs
and not playing football or
scooping in his $1 million plus
per year and remain a member of
the Giants.

Taylor then attempted to hit

as he described how much his
family meant to him while ﬁghting
to stay off drugs. How coming
home and seeing his kids scream
“Daddy!” as he came through the
door was such an inspiration and
a driving force in his life.

With Tay1or’s recent book
describing his problems, he has
already joined the many athletes
who have released literature
about the trials and tribulations
of professional sports. An
organization with a profit-seekin g
desire could be able to start a

book-of-the-month club whose
“authors” were strictly
professional athletes.

 

Where does this madness end?
Taylor's drug problem has been
publicized since its inception. The
media, especially television,
seems to be intent on legitirnizing
this ath1ete’s unacceptable

lifestyle while playing pro
football.

In America's ever-buming war
on drugs, athletes seem to have
garnered some sort of diplomatic
immunity from the consequences.
If a football player is guilty of
using cocaine, he receives a minor
suspension (a la Kevin Mack),
and is sent to some country club
rehabilitation center.

This country places its athletic
heroes on an unreachable
pedestal with a majority of ‘the
help coming from the media. If I
may refer to the long overdone

and drawn out affair of the Pete
Rose scandal, I once heard a
commentator remark that since
we perceive these athletes as
superheroes, we must
occasionally be reminded that
they too are human, with personal
ﬂaws just like the rest of us.
Nowl can’t speak for everyone,
butI do not know anyonewith a
multi-rnillion dollar gambling
problem or a severe drug
addiction. The point is, these
athletes are constantly in the
public eye, and as a result of their

profession, they automatically

are subject to the scrutiny of the
public eye and the media, as
Gary Hart well knows. A

One cannot afford to undertake
such actions which will tarnish
one’s name, dignity, or integrity;

However, our athletes, whether
they suffer severe punishment or
not, have their lives and their
actions constantly legitimized by
the American media. Pete Rose's
banishment from baseball was
barely handed down ten minutes
by Bart Giamatti when sports
writers and anchors were already
talking about his chances for
reinstatement into baseball and
the excellent chance of Rose
making the Hall of Fame. Rose

committed the cardinal sin against
the game of baseball, a rule which
is posted on every team's
clubhouse. Rose was a great
baseball player, but he is also a
diseased gambler who tarnished
the game of baseball.

Lawrence Taylor is perhaps the
best linebacker in the NFL, but he
was a troubled coke addict

In the Theisman interview,
Taylor kept saying,__how he
basically deserves to stay in
football because of his steady,
albeit interrupted, progress in
dealing with his addiction. Hey,
Lawrence, I have news for you.
You’re lucky to still be playing
the-game.

It was absolutely sickening to
see this person on national

  

television, equipped with his new
jerri-curl Michael Jackson hairdo,
lamenting to the public about his
drug problems and what a difficult
road he has had to follow. He is
lucky that he is given the chance
to follow that road which is always
paved by the NFL. '

Lawrence Taylor is nothing
more than an excellent football
player with a cocaine problem.
And his alleged conquering of
this problem is portrayed as the
Second Coming by the media.
This type of treatment of athletes

»by the media is inexcusable.

Athletes like this are supposed to
be setting an example for children
everywhere, not to mention their

own children. Asjim Brown says I
B in his new book Out of Bounds,

“some people say athletes should
be concerned about setting an

example for children. Tell that to
an athlete addicted and all they're
concerned about is stuffing coke
up their noses.”

Then so be it. It may be a great
accomplishment to recover from

a severe drug addiction, but these ,

athletes are merely returning to
the point, if they recover, where
they should have been all along.
Free from illegal substances and

free to uphold the name and

tradition of the pinnacle of athletic
achievement in this country,
professional sport.

These privileged people are
certainly under the reigns of some
very generous people. No one
defines the term “second chance”

I (as well as third or fourth or fifth

chance) better than professional
sports leagues. I

Lady Panthers go 2-1 in Notre Dame Volleyball tourney

By Ron Ledgard
For The Pitt News

The Pitt volleyball team went
into Southbend, Ind., this past
weekend to face the major
challenge of playing three
nationally top 20 ranked teams in
the two-day Notre Dame
Tournament. They met the
challenge by going 2-1 and
improving their season mark to 8-
2.

In the first game of the
tournament, the Lady Panthers
played NO. 4 Paciﬁc tough, but
ended up losing the match 5-15,
13-15, 16-18. Paciﬁc was the
winner of NCAA titles in 1985 and
1986.

“We came out ﬂat in the first
game losing 5-15, but played
tough and were able to play with
them the rest of the way,” said Pitt
head coach Sue Woodstra.

Pitt played their host, Notre Dame.
Notre Dame has a young team
and lost ﬁve letterwinners from
their 1988 team. The held a 1-3
into the
tOurnament.They were not a very
gracious guest easily handling

record coming

the Fightin’ Irish 15-7, 15-5, 15-7.

“We handled Notre Dame pretty
easily by just playing very well,”

said Woodstra.

The next opponents for the
Lady Panthers were the Western
Michigan Broncos. Pitt holds a 4-
1 edge in the all-time series

between the two teams.

The Broncos were 2-1 and
suffered their only loss to Ball
State in the Ball State Volleyfest
the previous weekend. Western
Michigan head coach Rob Buck

was disappointed with the loss
but was looking forward to the
competition of the Notre Dame
Tournament.

was a signiﬁcant loss, but it's time

to move On. Our team has

accepted it and so has our
coaching staff,” said Buck. “The

N Otre Dame Tournament will be
less hectic than [the Volleyfest].

Everything will be match play
and counts. I think Pacific is
unquestionably the best team and
the other three are untested as of
yet.”

According to Woodstra, the two
teams were evenly matched and
the ﬁnal score proved that
statement.

The Lady Panthers defeated the
Lady Broncos in a tough-fought
match 17-15, 15-12, 10-15, 5-15,
15-7.

early wins and then showed a
lack of concentration by losing
the next two,” added Coach
Woodstra, “then we came out in
the ﬁfth gameand just steamrolled
them.”

Outside hitter Julie Sheils and
setter Janelle Langtagne were
named to the All-Tournament
Team. This is two weekends in a
row Sheils has been named to a
tournament team

Coach Woodstra was pleased
that her team improved its record
to 8-2, but admitted it isn’t playing
as well as it could.

“We have had a few problems
this season with lack of intensity,
but we are becoming more

consistent and more able Of
maintaining high intensity
throughout our matches,” said
Coach Woodstra.

The schedule doesn’t get easier
for Pitt; in fact, it gets a little
tougher. This weekend the Lady
Panthers head to Lincoln, Neb.,
to participate in the Cornhusker
Tournament. Once again the
other three teams are ranked in
the top 20. Besides Pitt and
Nebraska, the tournament
includes No. 3-ranked Stanford
and the Lady Wildcats of
Kentucky.

Woodstra would say only two
words about the upcoming
weekend: “Very tough.”

Blatz  

Continued from page 7

lead pass from Mostinckx.

“That's the type of movement
that wins ball games,” said Blatz.
“I try to anticipate what my
teammates will do, and make
cuts off the ball to open up space
for them." '

I This type of leadership may be ‘

one of the reasons why Blatz was
chosen to be a co—captain by Pitt
head coach Joe Luxbacher.

“The captain doesn’t necessarily
have to be the most skilled player,”

said Luxbacher, “but one who is
well-respected by his teammates,
acts as a liaison between myself
and the team and sets a good
example for the others.”

“I like being the captain. The
others look up to me. I like filling
that role,” said Blatz.

Luxbacher added, “He gets the
others to remain very disciplined
when we aren't getting any
scoring chances. He doesn’t lose
his concentration, and keeps
everyone focused.”

Soccer

paid off.”

Luxbacher pointed out that St.
Francis lost to nationally-ranked
Long Island, N.Y., only by a 2-0
score.

On Saturday, Pitt’s three-game
win streak was ended by a strong
Bucknell team, 2-1.

The Bisons came out of the

starting blocks ‘fired up, but

seemed to have trouble with the
wet turf.

‘H4--I I

Balls were moving much more
quickly than the Bucknell players
expected Balls were also slipping
under Bucknell players’ feet.

The Panthers were not able to
take advantage of their
opponent's disorientation, and
Bucknell was able to maintain
intensity.

“They were pretty intense in
the beginning,” said co-captain
Sam Lanza. “We had trouble
sorting things, out. We got
frustrated towards the end of the
first half.”

The difference in the game was
the way each team crashed the
net on their set plays.

Bucknell created two goals off
set plays. I Pitt only achieved
injuring Bucknell’s starting
goalkeeper. The Panthers

. knocked out Bison goalkeeper
I Scott Racek five minutes into the

second half when Scott Alexander
barely missed a loose ball and,
instead, got a piece of the keeper’s
face with his foot.

Racek left the game to Rob

Gazzola.

Seven minutes into the second
half, Bucknell’s Evan Goldsmith

served a throw—in toward the
Panther goal. The ball fell

untouched in front of the goal " '
and off Panther defender Roberto I

Croce to the back of the net.

Ken Gulick got credit for the
goal.

The Bisons then took a 2-0 lead
off a corner kick as Jim Hewlett
sent the kick across the field to
Chris Lovecchio. Lovecchio
headed the ball back to the goal.

- Bucknell’s Terry Pelino beat a

Pitt defender to the ball to send it
by Panther keeper Jay Kapusta.

The goal was scored as a result
of mismarking by Panther
defenders.

“Nobody marked number four
ILovecchio],” said Pak.

Pitt avoided a shut-out when
leading scorer Mike Blatz got his
fourth goal in as many games
with. a minute remaining. The
assist went to Heinz Pak.

Pitt will travel to West Virginia
on Wednesday. Game time is 7
p.m.

Pitt’s next home game is
Saturday against Georgetown.
The game will be played, at
Sewickley Academy at 1 p.m.
