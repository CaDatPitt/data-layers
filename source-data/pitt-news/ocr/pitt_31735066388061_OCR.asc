UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Beleaguered Bozik announ

By Mike Rampa
and Jennifer Calabrese
T be P!!! News

Edward E. Bozik, Pitt’s director of
athletics for the past nine years, yesterday
announced his retirement, effectivejuly 1,
1991.

“I am retiring from the University of
Pittsburgh to honor a long—standing
commitment to my wife and my children.
After 22 years of military service and 16
years at the university, the time has now
come for us to enjoy life in a more relaxed
style,” Bozik said.

Bozik was recruited as Pitt President
Wesley Posvar’s assistant in 1975. Posvar
and Bozik knew each other from the U.S.
Air Force Academy. When Bozik came to
Pitt, he joined former Executive Vice
President Jack Freeman, another Posvar
recruit.

Freeman left for a position at Temple
University on Nov. 1 after Posvar’s
announcement in May that he would be
retiring at the end of this academic
year.Bozik denied that his retirement was
connected to Freeman and Posvar’s
departures.

“I'm sure that constniction is going to be
put upon [my retirement], and there's
nothing I can do about it. 1 know why I’m
retiring, and I know why I'm retiring at the

time I am. Ican’t worry about things I can’t
change,” Bozik said.

Bozik thanked the people he has worked
with at Pitt.

“Whatever contributions 1 may have
made to the university, they have been
theirs; the errors have been mine," Bozik
said.

At the Board of Trustees meeting in
which Bozik announced his plans to retire,
Posvar spoke of Bozik’s accomplishments.

“When he was still in my office, I felt it
desirable for him to largely oversee the
department of athletics because of some
[...] management difficulties,” Posvar said.

“It was during those years that we
became the national champs in football
and developed the winning tradition in
major sports — national rankings much of
the time -— a tradition which continued
today. It was also the period in which we
initiated the drive for academic reforms.
lid has not only served in this university
but as a vital member [of the] NCAA
executive committee as an advocate of
reforms,” he said.

Posvar called Bozik’s service to the
university “invaluable.”

“'lhis is an emotional event for me, as I
know it is for Ed Bozik,” Posvar said.

Posvar lauded Bozik’s commitment to
academics.

Pitt is planning the construction of
a 500—bed dorm and an international
center, Pitt President Wesley Posvar
announced yesterday.

The new residence hall, which is
expected to cost $20 million, will be
located on University Drive on a hill
above Pitt Stadium. It will be situated
between two clusters of fraternity
houses.

The dorm is scheduled to open in
the fall of 1992. Posvar said that the
dorm will be modeled as a “student

Posvar critical
of BAS stance

By Jennifer Calabrese
News Editor

Pitt President Wesley Posvar
expressed concern yesterday about the
recent statement from the Black Action
Society that it can no longer recommend
Pitt for black students.

‘Well, I'm very surprised that minority
students are interfering with affirmative
action. I think that's perverse. I think
that our black faailty and administrators
have all made that comment. And I
think that most of our black students
think that that's not a constructive
position to take,” Posvar said.

The Pitt presidential search has been
narrowed to 18 candidates, according
to Farrell Rubenstein, chairperson of
the search committee.

‘We believe that we have a very high-
quality group of prospects," Rubenstein
told the Board of Trustees. ‘We are very
satisfied with the group that we have at
this point in time.‘

The 24-member committee reviewed
over 100 applicants and conducted over
30 interviews before deciding on 18
candidates for second interviews,

The Board of Trustees has decided
to support Pitt’s policy of withholding
campus police reports from the public.

The policy ‘was designed to protect
individuals," said trustee Alice
Kindling.

Kindling, who heads the BOT
student—affairs committee, said her
committee discussed the issue on
Monday because of the conflict
between 7bePr'ttNewsrequesting full

Posvar continues Pittﬁgbtfor more funding from state

By Scot Ross
Editor in Chief

After listening to Pitt President
Wesley Posvar read Pitt’s position
on the $16.5 million awarded by
Pennsylvania to Penn State to
build a sports complex, state
Senator Richard A. Tilghman
asked Posvar why he wasn't more
willing to fight the decision.

Posvar then informed
Tilghman, the majority chairman
of the Senate Appropriations
Committee, that Monday was his

 

lllll

     

47th trip to Harrisburg to present
Pitt’s budget to the committee,
and that he had learned to
suppress his anger.

Posvar did argue that the
$132,149,000 for fiscal year 1992,
an 11.4 increase over last year,
was justified despite Gov. Robert
Casey’s recent proposal for a zero

increase. The budget is based on
a 6-percent tuition increase and a
7.S—percent salary hike for staff
and faculty.

In a statement released Monday,
Posvar said, “Higher education
has yet to be a true priority for the
commonwealth. It is most
unfortunate that Pennsylvania’s
leaders would tolerate such a
low ranking for so long in such a
productive and worthy
commonwealth endeavor.”

Pennsylvania currently ranks
48th among states in giving funds

to colleges and universities.
According to Student Government
Board President Brent Saunders,
who attended the event, Posvar
said not only do Pitt, Penn State
and Temple support 170,000 jobs,
but also the money university
employees return to the state is
approximately 26 times the
funding the state provides to
higher education.

Posvar’s presentation also
included discussion about Pitt’s
39th—place ranking out of 57
schools in the Association of

American Universities with
respect to professor’s salaries.

“As the market for university
professors tightens over the next
decade, our ability to attract
renowned scholars and
impressive new talent must
improve," Posvar said.

In his proposal, Posvar stated
three goals he felt the state and
the university must move toward
in the coming year:

-Increase the rank of state
funding to 25th in the nation.

Pitt student recovers after wee/eend stabbing

By Jim Wechsler
saw‘ Writer

(Editor's note: The name of the
victim has been changed in this
story.)

Three days after receiving
serious injuries during an early-
morning confrontation, Pitt
student Joseph Michaels will
return home from the hospital.

At about 12:30 a.m. Sunday,
Michaels was attending a party
thrown by friends at 331 McKee
Place. Michaels was returning to
the party from the front yard
when a group of people
approached. In passing, Michaels
jostled at least one of them, and
an altercation developed.
Michaels’ roommate, Pitt
sophomore john Lamagna, was
also outside, and he said someone
in the group stmck Michaels in
the head with a brick.

One ofMichaels’ female friends
ran inside to the party in David
Weitzman’s apartment and said,
“Dave! Dave! They’re fighting
outside."

Weitzman said when he arrived

at the scene, Michaels’ face was
bleeding. Weitzman said Michaels
then pointed after one of the
ﬂeeing group members to identify
him as the one who threw the
brick. Weitzman said he and a
number of friends chased the
suspect down McKee Place and
across Louisa Street. Weitzman
and another friend pursued him
as far as Dawson Street, where
they lost him.

“I'm positive he was wearing a
Pitt varsity jacket,” said Weitzman.
“He was looking back [over his
shoulderl," he added.

Mike Watson, Weitzman’s
roommate, said Michaels and
other friends followed, hoping to
find Weitzman and his friend.
Watson chose to remain behind
because the party was still going
on.

Michaels, Lamagna and Brad
Wyland, another friend, were
searching for the others at the
corner of Semple and Bates
streets, when a white Chevrolet
Sprint pulled up to the corner.
The driver beeped the horn

repeatedly.

“We didn’t know what they
were beeping at,” said Wyland.
But “Uosephl headed over that
way.”

A shouting match ensued.
Lamagna said a passenger in the
back seat warned Michaels, “l got
a blade. Get out of here.”

When the suspect attempted to
get out of the car, Michaels shut
the car door on him. The suspect
was able to get out, and he
stabbed Michaels in the abdomen
and slashed the left side of his
face from cheek to chin. Lamagna
said the .suspect then got back in
the car and fled.

Wyland said a woman had been
watching from across the
intersection.

“She was telling us to shut up.
I told her to get help, but she
wouldn’t listen," Wyland said.

Weitzman said, “She saw the
whole damn thing right in front
of her face.”

Wyland said he stayed with
Michaels while Lamagna took
down the license plate number
of the Sprint and went for help.

Michaels said he didn't realize

that he'd been stabbed in the
abdomen; he thought he had just
been punched.

“I kind of passed out," said
Michaels. “A lot of the night is
kind of sketchy."

By the time police arrived,
Wyland had escorted Michaels
back to the apartment. He was
taken to Presbyterian University
Hospital, where he received
plastic surgery for his face.

“They had to cut me open and
check all my organs," said
Michaels. I-ie added that he
sustained no internal injuries.

Michaels said he would be able
to leave today. “My parents are
going to take me home,” he said.

Weit7man and Watson said they
felt the situations were unrelated
but not uncommon.

“Everybody knows how tough
it is," said Weitzman. “There are
things that are minor where
people get the shit beat out of
them but do not end up in the
hospital."

The suspect in the stabbing
turned himself in and is awaiting
a hearing, according to Weitzman.

Brown addresses problems of racism in Pittsburgh

By Lane Hornfeck
Sta_0" Writer

The problems of racism within the city
of Pittsburgh and within society as a
whole were addressed by Byrd Brown, a
mayoral candidate in 1989, yesterday
evening at the Cathedral of Learning.

Brown said there are many problems
within Pittsburgh which might be easier to
understand if they are likened to something
everyone can relate to.

Brown said, “One of the problems of an
alcoholic or an addict is denial. Pittsburgh
is in the throes of denial on the issues of
racism. Somehow over the years, it has
only been surface-wise, at a rhetorical
level. [Society] has produced a faulty image;
the practices are vintage pre—1960.”

Brown graduated from Yale University
in 1951 and went on to graduate from Yale
Law School in 1954. He has been practicing
law in Pittsburgh since 1956 and has his
own law office. During his speech, Brown
described his life.

“I led the march [in 1963110 Washington
D.C., from Pittsburgh,” said Brown. “When
we sang, ‘We Shall Overcome,’ we meant
everybody. We meant people who truly
believe in brotherhood and sisterhood
and in people. I think what has happened
since then is that we have become so
polarized that we are now paralyzed in
our efforts to come together to create a
coherent, consistent institutionali/.ed
change.”

According to Brown, change rnusl come
from within the individual.

“Times have changed, and I think what
we have to do is search our own hearts,
confront the monster of racism which is in
all of us and begin the process of coming
together,” said Brown.

Brown said people against racism can
reach out, get involved and become the
majority.

Brown, who is originally from the Ilill
District and currently lives in Oakland,
believes the university “lisl bound up in
the attitude that reflects the city.”

“There is a common thread of denial.
We have a serious problem: racism. This
is a racist city; this is a racist community,”
said Brown.

According to Brown, the Community
only addresses racial problems when there
is a threat or a crisis.

“As soon as the perceived threat or crisis
is over, Pittsburgh pats itself on the back
and goes about business as usual," said
Brown.

Brown described a personal experience
to illustrate the problems here at Pitt.

‘'1 attended the commencement of the
Ilarvard Medical School, and 18 out of156
who graduated were black. I don't know
accurate numbers, but I don't think Pitt
has graduated 18 l)lacks [from its medical
school] in a decade,” said Brown.

In addressing the issues on campus,
Brown spoke about his own beliefs about
racism.

“I have always tried to respond to our
young people. For me, it is not a matter of
dictating; it is just a matter of sharing a

Posvar said he suggests the
BAS “support our affirmative-
action program and help us recruit
students.”_

Posvar reiterated his
commitment to helping increase
the number of black faculty. The
BAS cited the lack of black faculty
as a reason not to recommend
Pitt.

“If we find a black faculty
member who’s qualified, whom
we want, we will find the funds.
Even if we don't have funds, we’ll
find them," Posvar said.

At yesterday ‘s Boa rd of Tmstees
meeting, a permanent trustees’
committee for affirmative action
was established. Posvar said the
establishment of the committee
was not in response to the BAS
statement.

“This committee was decided
upon many weeks before the
BAS questions were raised. It's a
standing committee. It will be
long term. And it will look
fundamentally at issues and
concerns," Posvar said.

established as a result of several
trustees deciding that it would be
“helpful” to have the committee.

“The board will demonstrate
active involvement, counsel,
guidance and support of our
[affirmative-actionl program and
hopefully accelerate it to achieve
our ultimate goal," Marous said.

BOT vice chairperson Frank
Mosier will chair the committee.

Marous praised Pitt’s Affirmative
Action Office. “It is staffed with
some very capable people, and it
has been functioning for some
time,” Marous said.

Rubenstein said. The first
interviews were conducted by
sub—committees; the second
interviews will be conducted by
the entire search committee.

On March 8 the committee will
select a “short list” from the 18
candidates. The candidates on
the short list will be interviewed
on campus by the full committee
and by other constituencies.

The committee will probably
give the office of the chairperson
of the Board of Trustees a list of
three to five final candidates in

early April, according to
Rubenstein. Those final
candidates will be reviewed by
that office, and then the final
decision will be put to a vote of
the Board of Trustees.

“The committee has worked
very hard, and we have not even
hit the hardest part yet. For
example, over the next two weeks
we will conduct over 30 hours of
interviews,” he said. “The
committee has been diligent,
conscientious and conducted
affairs at a very high level in the
best interests of the university.”

Budget

0 Give funding according to the
“distinctive missions" of public
research universities.

-Acknowledge the vital role of
graduate and professional
education.

Posvar stressed the importance
of research in education and said
it brought millions of dollars in
federal aid to the state.

“Research universities are
responsible for training
tomorrow's professionals. Schools

of law, medicine, dentistry,
pharmacy, nursing, business,
engineering and schools that
provide advanced preparation for
careers in public health, computer
and informational systems,
international affairs and public
administration are integral pans
of comprehensive research
universities,” Posvar said.

“Pennsylvania needs these
professionals, and Pitt provides
them. As the commonwealth
moves further into the post-

industrial age, the number of
highly specialized occupations
which require advanced training
will increase dramatically.”

Among the funding Pitt
requested was $600,000 for
disadvantaged students,
$15,432,000 for the School of
Medicine and Western Psychiatric
Institute & Clinic, $550,000 for
the Pittsburgh Cancer Institute
and $500,000 for the Institute for
the Black Family.

Reports

Continued from page 1
university's policy is to provide
The Pitt Newsand the public with
summaries of the reports instead.
These reports do not contain any
names.

Kindling told yesterday's BOT
meeting that after “considerable
discussion”
decided to vote unanimously to
supporting the policy.

Emeritus trustee Ruggero
Aldisert presented a formal
resolution supporting the policy
to the board.

“The Board of Trustees, on
recommendation of the student-
affairs committee, hereby
endorses the university's current
disclosure practices for criminal
incident reports as judiciously
designed to protect the interests
of identifiable individuals pending
investigation, and at the same
time provide accurate information
to enable the public to protect
itself,” stated the resolution, which
was passed unanimously.

Aldisert’s reason for presenting
the resolution was twofold.

“Part of the reason that Alice
lKindlingl has asked me to make
this report is not so much that I
am the former chair of this
committee, but I suppose it stems
from the fact that 50 years ago as
I speak, I was the editor in chief
of 7be Pitt News," Aldisert said.
“And for 30 of the years
subsequent to that, I have been a
judge — mainly a U.S. circuit

the committee ‘

judge.”

Aldisert said he sees the conflict
between The Pitt News and the
university as “bringing to tension
two very fundamental concepts."

“One is the concept of the
public’s right to know. The other
tension is the highly desirable
concept of protection of the rights
of privacy," Aldisert said.

As a judge, Aldisert said he has
often been faced with the conflict
of these two concepts.

"1 am constantly faced with the
problem of weighing these
important concepts — concepts
that are basic to the missions and
goals of this university as well as
inherent to the state constitution
and the federal constitution and
the state statutes and the federal
statutes,” Aldisert said.

Aldisert said he supported the
campus police’s policy of giving
summaries of reports to the public.

“The summary is redaction of
the names ofthe individuals, and
this is so because this is at the
most preliminary aspect of the
investigation,” Aldisert said.

Aldisertsaid withholding names
protects individuals.

“It is important at this early
stage to withhold certain
information to protect those
identiﬁed in the reports from
invasion of privacy, to protect
those identified from defamation,
to protect this university from
liability for invasion of privacy,"

Aldisert said.

Ruling too quic/ely...

In a court of law, judges are supposed to be able to listen
to both sides of a case and make an objective decision. In
the case of one judge, however, that code seems to have
been abandoned outside the courtroom.

U.S. Circuit judge Ruggero J. Aldisert, an esteemed
member of Pitt’s Board of Trustees, decided yesterday to
endorse the university's position of withholding campus
police records from the public. He did this after hearing
the university's position but not after hearing the opinion
of the public. As a result, the board voted unanimously to
pass a resolution supporting the university.

pf’ ’He__said the university merely wants to withhold the

‘names for reasons of privacy. He obviously has not kept
up with the times. 7be Pitt News has consistently stated
that it holds a policy of not printing the names of
individuals involved in crimes.

The board said it would support the resolution because
it was designed to protect individuals. Aldisert said, “I join
enthusiastically in the resolution, and I am proud to
present it at this time because I believe that what the
university has done here as a policy is submit a summary
of incident reports.”

This stance by Aldisert and the board, however,
contradicts the law that Aldisert normally upholds. By
withholding public information from public access, the
university clearly violates the 1965 Pennsylvania Right to
Know Act, which states that all public agencies must give
the public access to their records.

It is especially disturbing that Aldisert has journalistic
background. He was the editor in chief of The Pitt News
during 1940-41. He should know the value of campus
crime information.

As a former editor in chief, we would think that Aldisert
would know the value of informing the collegiate populace
of the happenings on campus. Crime occurred on this
campus in 1941 as well as in 1991, and the public still
needs to be informed of it. Yet this former editor claims
that summaries should be sufficient for a student
newspaper.

As a judge, Aldisert is supposed to be objective.
Objectivity is also a critical quality of journalism. The Pitt
News cannot see how a man with such qualifications and
experience has forgotten the lessons of the past 50 years
so suddenly.

Partially as a result of Aldisert’s “expertise,” the board
blindly accepted the resolution. It does not matter to the
board that what the university is doing is illegal. It does
not matter to the board that people could be harmed by
the lack of information from the reports. Only a biased
opinion which would make the university look good
seems to interest the Board of Trustees.

Bozik follows Posvar’s steps

As the University of
Pittsburgh diligently searches
for Pitt President Wesley
Posvar’s replacement, the
athletic department searches
for something more: quality
leadership.

Athletic Director Ed Bozik
announced his retirement
yesterday, becoming the last
cog in the Posvar regime to
leavejack Freeman, the other
part of the Posvar threesome,
left last fall for a position at
Temple University.

Bozik, however, has been
mired in controversy for the
past seven years. Many
scandals and problems, from
unqualified coaches to
possible recruiting violations,
have rocked the athletic
department.

Two years ago, he watched
as the Pitt basketball team
recruited five players, almost
its entire recruiting campaign,
and watched all of them fall
victim to Proposition 48. This
contradicted his stance as a
stalwart for academics.

He also oversaw the firing

other non—revenue sports into
the conference, Bozik has

This year, the Big East has
added a football conference
to its list and is virtually assured
in securing a major bowl slot.
The revenues from that will
most likely prove to benefit
Pitt, not to mention all
conference members.

However, some of the
football member schools are
not deep and rich in football
tradition (Rutgers, Temple,
Virginia Tech). This
conference certainly has its

the ramifications of this remain
to be seen.

Posvar told Bozik, “Through

education.” It is a shame he
could not do the same for
Pitt's athletic department.

Three ’s a charm 

Panthers win

By Scott Campbell
Assistant Sports Editor

CHESTNUT HILL, Mass.—
Maybe their ears were still ringing
after visiting the Carrier Dome
over the weekend. Or maybe
they realized they couldn’t win
the Big East title anymore. Or
maybe they remembered it was
only Boston College.

Whatever it was, the Panthers
needed all 40 minutes —— well, at
least 30 of them —— last night to
overcome an eight-point, second-
half deﬁcit and beat the Eagles
88-76 at the Conte Forum.

Pitt improved to 20-9 and 96
in the Big East, while BC fell to
11-17 and 1-14.

The Panthers were down 46-
38 early in the second half when
Pitt Coach Paul Evans inserted
his three-guard lineup Oason
Matthews, Darelle Porter and
Sean Miller), who bombed the

Eagles for six consecutive three- .

pointers.Matthews hitatrey with 5 “

14 minutes and 10 seconds left,
and the Panthers took a 53-51
lead and never trailed again.

‘That lineup made a big
difference,” said Matthews. ‘They
were doubling down on Brian
[Shorter] and Bobby [Martin], so
that left us open to hit the open
shot."

“We just came out flat. In the
second half we played like we
are capable of playing and picked
up our intensity,” said Miller.
“We have to play like that all the
time, but we don’t do that every
night.”

The three-pointers eventually
opened up the inside for Pitt, and

the Panthers went on a 30-13 run
over 12 minutes in the second
half to clinch the win.

Overall, the team made 10 out
of 20 three—pointers, led by Miller,
who canned five of eight and
finished with 21 points. Matthews
hit four of nine and finished with
18.

Inside, Shorter finished with
11, all in the second half, and
Darren Momingstar muscled in
for 10 more. Bobby Martin added
eight and a team-high 15
rebounds.

The Panthers close out the
regular season Saturday at home
against Connecticut and with a
win can clinch a tie for second
place in the conference. If they
lose, however, they can finish as
low as fifth. But they are not
even thinking of that scenario.

“We'll win 10 games and be
one of three teams with 10 going
into the tournament," said Miller.
“lAndl I don’t think anything is
sure as far as Syracuse walking
away with it or anything.‘

‘I'll take a tie for second," said

Matthews. ‘There‘s nothing
wrong with that. It [also] feels
great to win 20 games because,
we only won 12 games last year
and the year before that, only
17.’

Before a crowd of 6,239 that
acted like it would rather be
studying for a biology mid-term,
the Panthers played in the first
half like they wished they could
join the crowd.

But who could blame the fans?

The Panthers clawed back, and
when Chris McNeal hit a jumper,
Pitt led 24-23. But Curley and the
Eagles would not give up. He
added six more, and BC took a

B0z2'le’s departure will leave unanswered questions bebina’

By Rob Mazur
suqr Writer

The face of Pitt athletics changed again
on Tuesday. Edward Bozik, athletic
director and assistant president of the
university, announced he was stepping
down after 16 years of service at the
university.

Bozik’s retirement came amid an in-
house investigation of former Pitt football
assistant coach Frank D’Alonzo and the
sudden decision of star running back
Curvin Richards to turn pro after being
suspended from the team for academic
reasons.

The sudden departure of Bozik came
after months of speculation about the
security of his job since his friend and
boss, President Wesley Posvar,
announced his own retirement lastspring.

Bozik originally took over the job as
director of athletics on Sept. 1, 1982, after
his predecessor Casimir Myslinski, retired
early on May 12, 1982. Bozik was named
to fill the role on June 30, 1982.

At the press conference announcing
his appointment, then—senior
administrative vice president Jack
Freeman said Bozik was hired even
though Bozik did not apply because the

foundation for a successful athletic program
had already been laid.

‘If our athletic department had needed
a shaking up, we might have gone outside,”
Freeman said. ‘But we have an outstanding
program, and Ed Bozik is the man who
can keep it strong.”

Some of Bozik’s initial goals were to
maintain sufficient authority over the head
coaches of football and basketball, the
two main revenue sports; to install lights
at Pitt Stadium; to play basketball games at
the Civic Arena; and to improve the
academics of the entire athletic program.

When he was hired, Bozik said, “This
university will not recruit any young man
or woman who does not have a realistic
chance of graduating. This is no different
than the past, but it’s a principle that I
intend to abide by.”

While Bozik has succeeded in lighting
Pitt Stadium and having the Panthers play
four basketball games a year at the Civic
Arena, the other two goals in Bozik’s plan
still have question marks beside them.

The current investigation into the football
program under Coach Mike Gottfried’s
reign still has yet to clear up questions.
Gottfried, in fact, was given a lifetime
contract by Bozik after Gottfried came in
and “cleaned up” a program that was

hemorrhaging profusely from the stint of
Serafino “Foge" Fazio.

Hiring Fazio was not Bozik’s decision.
Fazio was hired by Myslinski after Jackie
Sherrill took his act to Texas A&M. Fazio
enjoyed two successful seasons, mainly
because of Sherrill’s recruiting efforts.
Hard times befell the football program as
the team went 3-7-1 in 1984 — the first
losing season for a Panther squad since
1972 — and 5-5-1 in 1985.

So, Fazio got the ax, and in came
Gottfried to restore glory to a once-proud
program. However, Bozik’s pledge to
recruit only the top students in both
athletics and academics fell by the wayside.
Under Gottfried, Pitt began to win again,
but at the cost of its prestige.

Gottfried came under fire from the
athletic administration for trying to overstep
his bounds and question authority.
Gottfried was fired in early December
before Pitt’s}ohn Hancock Bowl matchup
with Texas A&M,.

His successor, Paul Hackett, fell upon
hard times this past season. Poor attitudes
and a lack of discipline, along with an
unusual rash of injuries, hurt the Panthers’
chances to repeat the success of the year
before.

Hackett has proved to be more

concerned with the team concept and
academics. He suspended the school's
No. 2 all-time leading rusher, Curvin
Richards, indefinitely for missing study
halls and team meetings and for not
meeting academic standards.

Hackett said, ‘I have to keep control of
100 young men. I cannot make exceptions
for individuals.”

Mysteriously, about a week after his
suspension, Richards announced he had
petitioned the NFL for draft eligibility.

While Bozik’s help or hindrance to the
football program remains a mystery, his
contributions to the basketball program
have helped put Pitt basketball on the
Big East Conference map. The Panthers
went from wallowing in mediocrity to a
power to be reckoned with nationally.

One of the main reasons for this is Pitt's
joining the basketball-strong Big East
Conference. This move, along with the
hiring of Coach Paul Evans, has helped
the Panthers go from conference doormat
to winners and challengers of conference
crowns in the past five years.

The interim director of athletics has not
been named yet, and a permanent
replacement probably will not be
announced until a new university
president is found.

Pitt's Dowling captures 3,000 meter run, Wins Big East

By Greg Wallace
Stajf Writer

Keith Dowling of the Pitt men's
track team took the honors as
the best in the conference,
outrunning two other NCAA-
qualifying athletes at the Big East
Championships at Syracuse, N.Y.
Dowling won the 3,000—meter
event, and helped Pitt to captu re
fourth place in the meet.

Surprisingly, the 3,000-meter
event is not exactly Dowling’s
specialty. He feels more
comfortable running longer
distances, specifically the 5,000
meters, and will be representing
Pitt in the 5,000-meter event in
Indianapolis.

“Winning the Big ‘East was a
specific goal,” said Dowling. “It
was very important to win the
event, but it was also just a
warmup for bigger things in the
upcoming outdoor season."

Pitt assistant coach Jim Lear
has worked very closely with
Dowling throughout the year.
Lear said the indoor season is
important for Dowling, but the
outdoor season should be
Dowling’s main point of
concentration.

“The outdoor season has been
out of main focus,” said Lear.

“The indoor season has been
mostly preparation for that time.
The championship of the 10,000-
meter outdoor event is what we’re
really shooting for right now."

“Pretty much everything that
I’m doing right now is gearing up
for the outdoor season,” said
Dowling. “I’m really looking
forward to it.”

Despite Dowling’s successes
in the shorter distance races, Lear
said Dowling improves as the
distance increases.

“I think he feels more
comfortable when the distance is
longer, ” said Lear. "He’s real good
at grinding things out. When it
comes to putting your nose to
the grindstone and pushing
yourself, that’s where he’s best.

“lie doesn't have super leg
speed. The indoor season is rough
on him, but he likes that speed
thatgoes alongwithit.'Ihelonger
the race goes, the better he is. By
working on his speed, he can get
better."

Pitt head coach john Vasvary
agreed with Lear and said there is
no limit to Dowling’s ability.

“The competition, especially
this year, has been pretty tough,”
said Vasvary. “just winning a Big
East Championship says a lot.
You really have to be at the top

of your game. I wouldn't say
there’s anything that Keith can't
do. He's got a good work ethic
and great ability. He's going to
be as good as he can be, and he’s
not going to let anybody get in
the way of that. I think Keith is
prepared to go on."

Vasvary credited a large part of
Dowling’s success to the research
and knowledge that Dowling puts
into each event that he
participates in.

“Keith has a real good
understanding of his event,” said
Vasvary. “He reads a lot about it,
and he knows what it takes. He
talks to fellow competitors all the
time.

“Keith is hard to coach. I don't
mean that in a bad way, but I
think he's demanding and
expects a great deal. when you
give him something to do, he
goes out and does it.”

I)owling said he enjoys the
teamwork that is involved
between a coach and an athlete.

“It’s been great,” said Dowling.
“We provide input from both
sides. Coach can tell me exactly
whatjl have to do, and I can give
him feedback. It’s a learning
process for both and a very good
situation."

Lear said he has thoroughly
enjoyed working with Dowling
and has watched him develop
over the seasons into one of the
premier runners in the nation.

“Keith has been a pleasure to

coach, without a doubt,” said
Lear. “Maybe the most of any
athlete I ever coached. He’s great
because you can talk to him, and
we can get work done.

“The work ethic has been there
the whole time. In the last two
years, it’s translated into
performances on the track. But
he’s always been a great worker.
He raced very inconsistently
when he was younger.

"It’s just been a matter of
experience on the track and
believing in himself.”

Dowling plans to attempt to
qualify for the 1992 Olympic trial
this spring in the 10,000-meter
event and maybe to try running
marathons afterward.

“Actually, this spring I could
qualify,” said Dowling.

“My goal is to run fast and
make it. Next year I'll be training
with that behind me in the 10,000
meter. But first, I’d like to win the
outdoor 10,000-meter event in
the NCAA. I feel it’s my event.

“I'd like to try [running
marathons]. Down the line for
me the longevity of the race
requires a lot more training. But
I'd like to give it a try," said
Dowling.

“I think in a marathon, he
certainly has some very good
possibilities,” said Lear.

“Nothing would considerably
have to change for the translation.
The only change would come in
the workouts. He’ll have to run

BE A VOICE AT PITT!!

more miles in terms of more
miles per week, but the mentality
is there, and its always been
there."

Dowling said he has a great
deal of pride in his career at Pitt,
and he wants to continue the
tradition of great athletes that
have come out of the track
program.

“I’m happy with how far I've
come, but I’m never satisfied,"
said Dowling. “I’m very proud of
the progress we’ve made, and I
can actually say that I helped
myself and others to compete."

THE PITI‘ NEWS,Wednesday, February 27, 1991

 

Parity abounds for upcoming Big East Tournament

By Derek Willis
Stag‘ Writer

As the Big East Tournament
time approaches, it’s time to assess
this season’s conference
performances. Undoubtedly, this
has been one of the strongest
conferences in the nation, and
the parity has been
unprecedented.

If Providence manages to grab
an NCAA Tournament spot,
perhaps eight Big East schools
will be invited to the “big dance,"
as it were.

While Mike Tranghese rakes in
the dough, 1et’s examine some
highs and lows from this season.

The confere nce’s Most Valuable
Player has to be Billy Owens of
Syracuse. Before all the line
Murdock fans start screaming
blasphemy, consider this: Owens’
team is in first place. Without

‘him, the Orangemen would be

where Providence is now— near
the bottom.

Murdock is the league’s best
player in spite ofhis team. Owens
is the MVP. Not a single opposing
coach will be sad to see either
player go after this year, but
Owens is the one.

Actually, on the ballot Murdock
finishesthirdtoOwens and Malik
Sealy of St. john’s.

While all are great players,
Murdock and Sealy are
bridesmaids because, as Pitt
proved, they can be taken out of
a game by a defense.

The only people who
consistently take Billy Owens out
of a game are Jim Boeheim and
Owens himself.

Next on the list is the biggest
disappointment category. For
teams, it has to be Pitt, although
some say that Connecticut could
be right there

At least the Huskies lost key
players from last year's squad

‘and could be expected to be

inconsistent. On paper Pitt wins
the title, but the Panthers seem to
play each game at a different
level of consciousness.

A player who continues to be
lost out on the court is St. _lohn’s
junior Chucky Sproling. It’s really
hard to believe that this guy
averaged a triple—double in high
school and once scored 74 points
in a scholastic game.

Sproling has absolutely no
concept of team offense or
passing the ball effectively. At 6-
foot—6, Sproling is the biggest
Waste of shooting ability in the
conference.

On the other hand, the biggest
surprise has been Dave Johnson
Of Syracuse. Enough has been
said about his improveme.nt, but
it should be interesting to see
how he fares next year.

Having Owens on your team
tends to improve your offensive
game without mttch work.

There were some impressive
newcomers to the Big liast this
year. These five could be a suitable
all-rookie team: Adrian Autry
(Syracuse) and Joey Brown
(Georgetown) at guard, and Chris
McNeal (Pitt), Dickey Simpkins
(Providence) Billy Cu rley (Boston
College) and Robert Churchwell
(Georgetown) up front.

Other players are worthy of
mention, including Gerrod Abram
(Boston College), Shawnelle Scott
(St.John’s), Ahmad Shareef(Pitt),
Jerry Walker (Seton Hall) and
Charles Harrison (Georgetown).

Autry should be Rookie of the
Year in the Big liast because he
has performed at a consistent
level and generally played like
he had more experience than
Michael lidwards, the other
Syracuse guard. The rest of the
aforementioned rookies are still
pretty raw and aren't as developed
as Autry at this stage.

Villanova is the team which
gets the most out of its offense.

This is important because it
enables the Wildcats to matchup
with almost any team without
sacrificing its offense.
Georgetown definitely has the

Toss in the fact that Robert

Bozik

Continued from page 1

“The phrase ‘student athlete,’ I
think, is a hallmark of what Ed
Bozik has stood for," Posvar said.

Bozik said, “I have been
committed to academic
excellence and athletic
excellence. It is not only desirable
but attainable."

Bozik had been an eyewitness
to the drastic metamorphosis the
role of athletic director has
undergone over the past nine
years. With the addition of drug
testing, mass-media exposure and
the intricacies of university
athletic policy, the modern-day
athletic director is a far cry from
its status nine years ago.

“It’s more complex. The range
of things you find yourself
involved in is much more
complex. I think we’re all a little
bit egocentric in the sense that
‘our times’ are the toughest. The
management side has become
far more complex. We're dealing
with radio and television
contractual matters, affirmative-
action matters, Title Nine matters

. many of which go beyond

your kin. So you end up with a
lot more specialization of your
staff,” Bozik said.

The relatively recent
complexities involving drug
abuse and student athletes all
over the country reached the
forefront of the nation's news
during Bozik’s tenure. As the
United States continues to embark
on its staunch anti-drug
campaign, athletes have become
one of the prime targets and
most highly visible testimonies
to the escalated‘ concern about
drug abuse.

According to Bozik,
determining regulations and
trying to make responsible
decisions about an athlete's future
when it involves alleged drug
abuse has further complicated
the present—day AD’s jobs. And
when it comes down to an athletic
director trying to play pharmacist,
things can get a little confusing.

“I am still on an NCAA

committee — sort of an ad hoc
committee that deals with drug
testing. I recently got a letter
from an athletic director that was
concerned with an article he read

concerning so-called ‘TE ratio’
—— a testosterone-epi-testosterone
ratio [steroid testl. And when I
get into a room full of physicians
and pharmacologists, and they
start tossing around language,
they have to put it in layrnan’s
terms [for rnel," Bozik said.

In addition, college athletics
has run into another stumbling
block by trying to determine the
validity of some of the current
measures of drug testing. Bozik
said he ran into a problem with
the International Olympic
Committee’s medical committee
and its unwillingness to share
results of the TIE ratio.

“So even though we’ve made
thousands of tests, we don’t have
the empirical data to say how the
TB ratio between a black and a
white or an Oriental are different,
and how significant is the
difference between men and
women? And the bottom line is
there’s been no damn research
on the matter," Bozik said.

“And then you get into the
legal dimensions of drug testing
and the right to privacy, and how
intrusive do you get on that? And
we haven't even come close to
touching the alcohol problem.
My experience with chemicals
we can test for with urine samples
is that it’s a lot easier to put a
deterrent out there than it is for
alcohol. Alcohol is very difficult
to test for without being overly
intrusive,” he added.

What it all inevitably comes
down to is that an athletic director

in the 1990s is faced with quite a
dilemma. An AD needs scientific,
pharrnological and legal expertise
to make reasonable and fair
judgments which concern the
future of an athlete who uses
drugs, according to Bozik.
Deciding the fate of a star or even
a marginal athlete is no small
task. And with the recent surge in
drug testing and the legal
implications of each individual
university's policy concerning
drug testing, the two may make
for some severe modern-day
headaches.

In addition to the role of “drug
czar,” Bozik said that as a core
function of his position, he is
forced to make day—to—day and
long-run policy decisions. As a
result, he has had to specialize
his staff over the years. However,
he still believes that the job of
athletic director can be handled
by one person at the University
of Pittsburgh.

And Bozik believes he has seen
the concept of sport take entirely
too much precedence in
American culture.

“I have to accept American
policy for what it is. There is a
significant over—emphasis in
American culture on athletics. I
look at what's happened in the
professional ranks in terms of
salary escalation and feedback,
kickback on the intercollegiate
side; that's going to happen  If
you take the view that there is
something here that’s worthwhile
doing, like educating young

people, that becomes the shining
ray you hang onto," Bozik said.

“I look at this year's graduating
class, and I see kids like l)arelle
Porter —— kids who are worth
being nominated to be senior of
the year. 'lhere’s enough of that.
I haven't become a cynic," he
added.

Bozik has been involved with
Pitt and Big East basketball almost
since the conference’s inception
10 years ago. lle was almost at
the head ofa school which had
founded the first football
conference in its history. But h’
is proud of the seeds that have
already been sown for the future
of Pitt football.

Pitt will play a full round-robin
conference schedule at the
beginning of 1993, giving the
school 10 conference games.

“Once Penn State makes up
their mind as to what they want
to do [continue Pitt-PSU
matchupsl, that gives us oureighth
game. Notre Dame gives us our

ninth game, and then you go out.

and get two other games. Chances
are they're notgoing to be against
a Nebraska or Southern Cal.”

In addition, the Orange, Cotton,
Sugar and Fiesta bowls have
expressed a strong interest in
adopting the Big East as their
representatives.

Bozik’s exit comes during an
in-house investigation ofpossible
infractions committed by former
assistant football coach Frank
D’Alonzo. Pitt has never been
given a public sanction or placed
on probation and is one of the
few NCAA programs which can
boast that claim.

Also, Bozik will be leaving
during an ongoing investigation
of a possible $100,000 in
misappropriated Golden Panthers
funds.

“The investigation that we’re
perfoming about the alleged
misuse of funds is under way,
and that, I think, is a random
event We may have had a coach

who, on his own, violated the V

rules, and of course there’s no
I00-percent way to prevent that,”
Posvar said.

Given the recent decline of the
Pitt football program, many
aspects of the athletic
administration have come under
fire. However, Bozik is confident
that Pitt football is on a steady
and true course.

“I have absolutely no doubt
that Paul Hackett is the right
coach for this university, and my
fondest hope is that people will
have patience and allow him the
time to build a program in the
right way; a program that honors
educational standards, integrity
and the standards of winning. I
am convinced that given time,
Paul Hackett will get that job
done?

Posvar said he will appoint a
panel to work on recruiting
Bozik’s replacement. The
committee will report to Posvar,
and its recommendations will be
presented to thenew president
as soon as a final decision is
required.

Bozik has not personally made
any recommendations for a
successor to his position, but he
said that if he were asked, he did
have certain people in mind.

life's experience and my
observation of what I believe is
nght" _

Brown said he is attempting to
offer a solution to the ever-
incrcasing problems ofracism by
distinguishing the difference
between the issues ofthe 60s and
the issues of today.

“It is much more subtle now.
Black people already have the
right to vote. There isn't a specific
thing to fight for,” said Brown,
but simply because there is not a
prevalent issue does not mean
that everyone should become
apathetic.

Brown said, “It is up to all ofus
to penetrate this entire community
and to create a society that is truly
pluralistic. Because we have better
ways to communicate, you have
the ability to talk to many, where
those in previous generations did
not."

Chris Moleski, president of
Students Against Racism, said, “I
agree with Brown because he
talked about the subtlety of racism
in the 905 as compared to the
outright situations they faced in
the 603.

"That is something that SIAR is
trying to figure out — how to
deal with the subtleties and
confront them,” said Moleski. “He
talked about reaching out and
dealing with awareness with the

community, and that is something
that SLAR is striving for."
