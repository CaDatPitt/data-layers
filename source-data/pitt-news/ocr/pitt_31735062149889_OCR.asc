An Editorial *j

Wherein We Try
To Figure Out
What SFA Is

We have been dissecting Pitt stu-
-dent government this week. On
Monday we made the point that bet-
ter student government could be
achieved only by reorganizing the
-entire set-up on campus. We also
said that Men’s council as such
should be abolished. On Wednesday
“we asked College association to drop
its social program and branch out
into an entirely new ﬁeld.

Today we consider another phase.
.Here’s what we think about Stu-
cdent-Faculty association:

 

« FA is the most criticized group

_ on. campus. Much of this criti-
cism 1S justiﬁed. Much of it is not.
Before an intelligent evaluation of
this group can be made, it is neces-
sary to cut through a bundle of
misunderstandings and a lot of
muddled concepts about the organ,-
ization.

To do this, certain essential
points which make up the real is-
sue in the indictment or endorse-
finent of this group have to be con-
sidered:

What is SFA supposed to be and
do? Is SFA doing this satisfactor-
.ily?

'What is SFA actually doing? Is
it doing this well?

W’E vsould say that every student
at Pitt (including SFA mem-
}bers themselves) thinks that SFA
is supposed to be the student gov-
ernment group on campus which is
lolessed with original jurisdiction
over the entire undergraduate stu-
-dent body. By student government
'.is meant an organization which de-
termines certain policies for the
vconduct of those activities which
directly concern the student wel-
fare and are not of academic na-
ture. The term “student” govern-
;ment does not necessarily mean
"“by the students” as much as it
means “for the students.”

This we emphasize is the gener-
al conception of the rule SFA is
supposed to be playing at Pitt.

If the work of SFA has to be
-evaluated from this standpoint, all
‘criticism to the effect that it is not
«doing a good job of student govern-
ing is entirely justiﬁed. SFA mem-
‘bers are making a less-than-feeble
attempt at it.

HE often-hurled "rebuke, “how-
ever, that SFA never does any-
‘thing is ill-founded. Such a charge
‘is uni air and results from a decided
ignorance of, the actual work of a
:group ,whi-ch during the year ad-
aninisters routine functions, ranging
from demonstration block forma-
‘tions at football games to the su-
ipe_rvision of festival week in the
spring. M , ' L I
Actually, SFA does a man-size
job throughout the year. It is an

agency managing certain al1-Uni-

‘versity functions which are of de-
cided beneﬁt to. every student at
Pitt. _

Is it doing a good job of this?
We think it is. We think that if
SFA is -to be judged on the basis
‘of the program of activities, it
should be given a fairly clean bill
of health.

SFA, then, according to political
-science shop-talk, performs the ad-
ministrative end of certain activi-
“ties ‘which the University has per-
mitted it to manage.

HE main consideration the con-

stitutional revision committee
must keep in mind is the difference
‘between:

a. A student government group
which ‘legislates (one that deter-
mines policy for all‘-activities).

b. One that simply administers
011' manages certain activities of
its own.

It will have to decide whether
‘SFA should be either one or the
other.

If it comes out for legislative
government, it will have to recom-
mend drastic revisions in the en-
tire student government set-up at
"Pitt. (This we have indicated in
our past two articles).

If it picks the latter course. it
will make a frank admission that
no such thing as all-University stu-
dent government exists at Pitt.

(On Monday we shall continue
our discussion on SFA.)

Second Term
Hospitalization A
Drive Begins

Dr. Jamison Urges
More Participation

The value of group hospitaliza-
tion insurance for students was
re-emphasized by Dr. A.ul’ecne. M.
Jamison, director of the Wom-
en’s Health service, this week,
as the second semester drive for
subscribers opened.

“I would like to see more stu-
dents, particularly women, sub-
scribe to the hospitalization plan,”
she said. “The insurance proved
of immense aid to students who
were hospitalized this semester.”
Pay At Treasurer’s Office

The second semester drive is now
in progress. Collection of the $2.50
payment for the second semester
will take place from February 10
to 28. Payment may be made at
that time in the treasurer’s office, 7
State hall.

It will be necessary for ﬁrst se-
mester subscribers to re-register for
the second semester, the Hospital
Association of Pittsburgh stated.

The hospitalization plan, the
ﬁrst of its kind ever conducted by
a college or university, is now in
its second year. It is conducted in
conjunction with the Student Health
service.

Students who register for the
service will be insured throughout
the semester against hospital bills
and will be granted hospital admis-
sion at any time during the semester
upon the approval of Dr. H. C.
Carlson, director of the University
Health service.

Twenty-One Days Free

The ﬁnancial saving to hospital-
ized students. who have insurance
is considerable. .Among the serv-
ices provided are room and board
for a total of 21 days in any one of
the 25 local member hospitals, use
of the operation room, necessary
dressings and casts, routine labora-
tory services, and ordinary X-ray.

Dr. Jamison and Dr. Carlson have
given the plan, sponsored by the
Pitt News and the Student Health
service, their unqualiﬁed support.
They disclose that many times in
the past they have not been able to
place ill students in hospitals be-
cause the students were not ﬁnan-
cially prepared to meet the ex-
pense.

Student Nurses

Receive Caps

Nineteen students of the Univer-
sity School of Nursing will receive
their caps at ceremonies Sunday at
3 o'clock in Eleanor Gillespie hall,

professional students at Pitt to re-
ceive the traditional insignia. This
ceremony signiﬁes the completion of
the pre—c1inical course.

Dr. Stanton C. Crawford, dean of
the college, will be the speaker.
Tea will be served followingthe
“capping” exercises.

ped will be eligible to wear the

. full uniform of the nurse: Virginia

Braley; Bernice Brisick; Mary Ann

night at the Esquire ball to the mu-
sic of Jan Savitt and his Top Hat-
ters. Dancing will be in the main
ballroom on the seventeenth floor
of the Hotel William Penn, from 10
till 2 o’clock.

Favors, an Esquire gallery, and
cocktails “a la coca-cola” at the Es-
quire bar will be the principal fea-
ture of the evening. The ball room
decorations will carry out a black
and gold theme, and a barrage of
ﬂood lights will give added effect.

Tickets are still available on the
ground ﬂoor and at the dean of
men’s oﬂice. They are printed in
the form of engraved invitations
and are priced at $4.

Chancellor Takes ii Walk,

Discovers U nannounced
Tribute in Commons Room

Students put one over on the Chancellor Wednesday when they gath-

ered in the Commons room to commemorate -John Gabbert Bowman’s

twentieth year as head of the University—-without the Chancellor know-

ing anything about the aifair beforehand.

No public announcement was
made and news ‘of the celebration
circulated» by word—of-mouth, no
words reaching! the ears of the
Chancellor until immediately be-
fore the ceremony.

‘ To the Students of Pitt-

I want to say thank you. The
mixture of surprise and of the
loveliness of human spirit in the
Commons Room Wednesday af-
ternoon 'was too much to talk
about. You were ‘kind and ex-
pressed more credit -than was
just, and then expressed it all
again in a beautiful, unlocked-
f0ll' gift. I was dumb. _

Here we are, each in doings
we call creative. We want the ful-
ﬁlment of our natures, the com-
plete ME in ourselves. We help
one another. It seems that I
never half knew before how
much help some encouragement
could be. No others could have
brought to me so strong, let me
say, a sense of the divinity of life
on the Pitt campus. It is a priv-
ilege to be here, to meet you, all
the way to meet you, and to give
back so far as I can the unforget-
table, encouraging kindness that
you give to me.

Students, Faculty
Hear Inauguration

Broadcast Monday 

Broadcast of the Presidential In- ‘

augural ceremonies may be heard
Monday in the Foster memorial at
11:30 o’clock. No classes will be
dismissed, however.

All University students and facul-
ty who have a free fourth hour have
been invited to hear the inaugural
ceremonies broadcast from Wash-
ington.

ROTC students have been re-
quested to wear their uniforms in
observance of Inaugural day and
the flag will be displayed near State
hall.

ROTC Men: Attention!

All ROTC men are required to
wear uniforms on Monday, Jan-
uary 20, the military department
announces.

In a proclamation of the City of

Pittsburgh Mayor Cornelius D.
Scully declared:
“Further, I urge that this ob-

servance (of Inaugural day) be
city-wide and of external aspect,
and not to be conﬁned alone to the
privavy of the home.
not only every man, woman and
child pledge themselves anew to
American democracy; but, that
every religious group and ‘creed,
every school and college, ‘every bus-
iness house and industry, every fra-
ternal and social group, every labor
union and trade association," every
political or other organization, -take
active part in this day,of.na_tional

, unity.” ,

Flu Epidemic
Hits University .

The near-epidemic of inﬂuenza
which has invaded the Pittlcampus
continues in its strides,-. affecting
students and faculty members alike.
As students, estimated at up to

“A one-third of the student body, came
. down with colds and- ﬂu, many fac-

ulty felt the swift blows of the in-
iection.

Hardest hit was the ofﬁce of
the dean of men. Robert R. Corley
and Theodore W. Biddle, assistants
to the dean of men, were stricken,
as were Betty-Jane Wallace, sec-
retary, and Edward B. Williams,
director of the placement bureau
for men, who was ﬁrst to return
to work this week.

Many other faculty members felt
the sudden pains in the head and
back and the dizziness which are
common ﬂu symptoms.‘ Some took
the advice of doctors and went‘
home, but. others stuck by their
jobs. , 1

Student sufferers from the ﬂu
and its allies numbered in the hun-
dreds, even though the administra-
tion would not admit that the
spread 'of‘the germs had reached
proportions which would requiring
the closing of the University. Sev-
eral colleges, including Washington
and Jefferson, and St. Vincent were
forced to suspend classes to avoid
further spread of the infection.

Engineers’ Group

Announces Division

The University chapter of the
American Society of Mechanical En-
gineering will split up into two
groups, one composed of juniors and
seniors and the other of freshmen
and sophomores, for the second se-
mester, H. Gee Skinner, E41, presi-
dent, has announced.

Skinner explained the division
of the seminar as resulting from an
expansion of the mechanical engi-
neering department. “This will
give more students a chance to be
active and it also will give ME sen-
iors an opportunity to speak before
a group in presenting their theses,”
Skinner stated.

The underclass section of the
seminar will be supervised each
week by a chairman from the sen-
ior group.

Surprise Party

In the Front Room

SEMI-PROFESSIONAL pride forces us to
state that yesterday’s surprise party for the
Chancellor did not catch us unawares.

We were glad to help in the hush-hush cam-
paign. There have been too many honorings of
personalities, which, while justiﬁed, have been
preceded by so much ballyhooing as to offset
completely the sincerity necessary to such occa-
sions.

Too often the would-be-conferrers of recogni-
tion have so enveloped themselves in their grand
schemes that they lost sight of the objective. The
conferree, more often than-not, has been left
standing somewhere in a corner and listening to
speakers ﬂourish the grand devices of breath-
control and diaphragmatic speech.

We are pleased that the honoring of Dr. Bow-
man should have taken place in the Cathedral.
Some there are who will argue that a twentieth
anniversary is just another day on the calendar.
Perhaps so. It is the conventional thing, how-
ever, to devote one day for special emphasis
upon recognition that should be given at all
times.

We like to think that there is more to‘Dr.
Bowman’s dream than the erection of impressive
buildings and pieces of art. The most important
thing, we believe, is that he turns out men and
women who have been made better by contact
with him and with the works of his genius.

Every student who graduates with the wish
that he could be coming back; every professor
who teaches for the sheer love of instructing an-
other; every University employee who, through
a sense of devotion, does his job completely and
well is a. tribute to the achievement of Chan-
cellor Bowman.

Revival‘ of the Great
Shakespeare Mystery

WHAT WITH the world’s troubles nearing an
all time high, what with wars, rumors of wars,
icy side+wa1ks, coming exams, mystery weapons,-
and -three-minute elevators (heh-heh) comes

ltmore misery in the form ofia revived Shake-
speare . Controversy.

A gentleman, -and a scholar, no doubt, name
of Arthur Sanborn, writes to the Members of
the Senate and House committees ‘on education,
and guarantees to prove that “at least ﬁve plays
in the Shakespeare Folio of 1623 were ‘not writ-
ten by William Shakespeare, of Avon, in whose
name they were published.” Mr. Sanborn
wants to offer conclusive evidence that “does
not exceed four thousand words . . . that can
be easily understood by any reader of intelli-
gence . . . that requires no argument . . . that
is of .world wide interest, sensational, and in-
disputable.”

Mr. Sanborn offers this evidence for only
ﬁfty thousand dollars, but “publication of the
evidence will save . the American public more
than ﬁfty thousand dollars annually . . . it will
eliminate ‘pilgrimages’ to Stratford: by many
thousand Americans.”

‘Well, Mr." Sanborn, you may be right and
you inay be wrong, all we, got to say is “Any
American -:who pi-lgrimages to Avon these days
mustnft’_'know”there-’s‘ a war ‘on, and any‘ guy that
don’t 'know.tthe_re’s a w_ar on shouldn’t be both-
ering about Shakespeare.”

Long Live the  - - -llops!
' ‘Add’, Comment that’s about two months too
late: “I won’t be here Monday, Dr. Soandso, I’m

goingto Washington to watch the coronation of
Franklin’ the First.”

Dear Bill N

I am sorry I didn’t write to you last Sunday’. Just
a little note. We didn’t eat to late today. My the way,
did you get the letter I sent before xmas. I am good
I hope you are good. Who was theperson in History

that landed on the main part of America. I saw Flight
Command Saturday. Thursday I; saw Tin Pan Ally.
it was swell. Did you see it. Don’t fool me because I
know it was out their. Tomorrow I am going to see
South of Suas. We gave appie a party Friday., Went
to Sunday school. Do you want terry and the Pirate
sent out. I wore my new paints last Monday and
shirt. I got a hunrd in English, in Reading. I got A
in a map in Georgaphy. My writeing May not be so hot.
But don’t forgot I am in bed. Don’t forgot I’ll be seeing
you soon. At the end of the month I hope. All dames
except one is D. O. T. P. ﬁrgue it out? Don’t think I’m
sick because I said I was in bed. But you see I am in
bed ready to go to Sleep. Well I guess I be seeing you.

Jim.

jim’s history-
nipped but i’m
just cracked

 

Big brother Jim’s latest communication, as you see,
is printed above, as nearly like the original as the lino-
type machine can make: it. To appreciate the original,
though, you should have the fun of actually decipher-

. ing it. . I  .\
Jim’s 10 you know, and’. his letters are ‘one offthe-

things that makes going to college what it isvfor me.
The history quiz question is almost a standard section
in his letters. Jim’s nipped on history. Just let him
know you ever had a history course and you’ll ﬁnd
yourself swamped with questions like the one above
about the “person in History,” or “How many ﬁngers
did Admiral Perry have on his right hand?”

The kids in our family are bugs about Terry and the
Pirates, and Jim got one of those Big-Little books with
Terry in. I only got a couple chapters read while I was
home last time; now Jim offers totake, care of it for me.

One thing, in this letter, however, puzzles me. That’s
Jim’s remark about “All dames except one is D. O. T.
P.’ I can’t for the life oflme “ﬁrgue it out?” Jirn’s
rule about women used to be (in a gruff voice): “All
dames is poison!” Now he has: “except one.”
can’t keep up with his notions on women. He’s one of
those idea-a-minute guys ‘anyhow. The “D. O. T. P.”
confounds me.

And another thing. Jim wasn’t too keen on my
writing about him that other time. If he ﬁnds out I
published his letter, he'll think I’m cracked for sure.

And he will, too.

Dr. Raiser Hits Intellectual Jackpot

0 His Book Rates as ‘Most Important Contribution’

By Oscar Sheﬂer

One hestitates to speak of a con-
temporary as being great. It must
be conceded, nevertheless, that Dr.
Oliver Reiser’s new book, The
Promise of Scientiﬁc Humanism, is
among the most’ important contri-
butions to the newest ﬁeld of uni-
versal thought. ”

Dr. Reiser conceives of- the his-
tory of; human understanding as
falling int7o_.‘tli1ree waves. * First was
the pre-Aristotelian, gfeatufed by
identiﬁcation rather than identity.
Primitive man; conceived of himself
as associated with all _things in na-
ture. He saw interrelationship be-
tween all the objects of the uni-
verse, although his associations
were more often than not non-ra-
tional. “Everything. is everything
else,” he said.

Aristotelian Orientation

In the second,‘ period, that of
Aristotelian orientation, which has
lasted for 3,000 years and is still
in effect, one ﬁnds restricted iden-
tiﬁcation. Here there appears the
fallacy of elementalism. Man harps
upon his own individualism. He
sear-ches for the objective fact. He
fails to perceive the relationship
of all things within the greater pat-
tern.

The third stage is the non-Aris-
totelian (non—Aristotelian, Dr. Reis-
er stresses, not anti—Aristotelian-
ism). There is a co—operation be-
tween cortex and thalamus, a fu-
sion of what we call reason and
emotion. We return, in a sense, to
the universal-identiﬁcation of prim-
itive man, although we do so with
national intent. Racial-religious
identiﬁcations disappear.

A Cure for Ailing World

This, then, is the basis of Dr.
Reiser’s new philosophy. He sees
it as the possible cure-for an ailing
world, the remedy for an age in
which our forms of thought have

' failed"‘to' keep-pace with «our mater-

ial progress. “The troubles of the
modern world,” he says, “are at
bottom a result of the failure of
philosophy.” All other theories
and suggestions-the Thomistic

DR. OLIVER. REISER.
a true philosophy is his

movement with its neo—Scholastic—
ism; Karl Barth and the “crisis”
theologians, with their religion; the
Oxford movement with its plea for
moral rearmament—he brands as
the indications of a “retreat from
reason.” All of these are based, he
contends, upon a lack of faith in
man’s ability to solve rationally his
own problems.

Man May Shape Own Future

Dr. Refser expresses his belief
that man may shape his own fu-
ture. The value of laissez-faire
has been greatly exaggerated.

After man has mastered the ele-
ments of his universe he must learn
to master himself.

Here, then, is the task of scien-
tiﬁc humanism. Man must now
complement his life-formula with
the addition of the emotional fac-
tor. In deciding whether or not al-
coholism is a vice one must take
into account the emotional factor,
the pure pleasure to be had from
alcohol and add that pleasure to
the scales. Aristotelian philosophy
fails to comprehend the dynamic

state of nature. It does not recog-
nize interrelatedness. It operates
on a pin-point of space and in a:
split—second of time, then ceases to
be effective.

The Lighter Touch

Here and there the book run in-
dications of the lighter touch, man-
ifestations of the author’s refusal
to bury himself in pedanticism. In

one section he quotes William James,

who said, “Reality isn’t so damned-
plastic after all!” In another para-
graph he says:

Mathematicians stand befuddled
before the paradoxes of an ‘inﬁn--
ite’—which they cannot do without
. Geologists and astronomers:
play celestial ping-pong with the
time concept, debating whether the
cosmos can be younger than the
stairs of which it is composed. In
the third ring of the scientiﬁc circus
the psychologists entertain the au-
dience with riddles: ‘VVhen is a
Behaviorist not a Behaviorist?
When he is conscious!” To com-
plete the tragicomedy it needs only
the last detail——educational practi-
tioners dedicated either to the reit-
eration of archaic formulas, or
blindly groping toward an unseen
light.-—-in either case an unimpres-
sive performance in the fact of un-
paralleled opportunity.

Reiser is possessed of a robust
humor which never leans over
backwards in praisingly—slight
damnation of those things which he
knows to be ill-founded.

A Triie Philosophy

Those who know Dr. Reiser,
either through classroom contact or
personal acquaintance, recomize in
him the sincerity of a man who
says, “I may be wrong,” and then
goes on to explain the “but-ness”
of his argument.

To this reviewer, there can be
no possibility but that Reiser is
right. He may be premature: his
philosophy may not ﬁt the temper-
ament of the times. It is, neverthe-
less, a true philosophy, one that
must eventually ﬁnd increasing
weight with the growth of our ma-
terial culture.

"By Charles Camarata
A perfect ‘tribute to the im-
portance of World War III was the
relegation to the second page in
some daily newspaper of the death
of James Joyce. Of the few peo-

ple who read of Joyce’s death with
any interest at all, there are two
groups.

First in the list of these groups
are those to whom Mr. Joyce is
“damn good stuff, if I could under-
stand him.” And failing to under-
stand him, they proceed to make
witty conversation by ridiculing
various passages and concerning
themselves only with the parts
wherein Joyce treats of the sexual
relations of the lower middle class-
es of Dublin. To them his death
does nothing.

0 The Passing of Genius

But to the other group the pass-
ing of James Joyce was the passing
of genius. The people that make
up this group are the ones that feel
he has something to ‘say and says
it profoundly. Unfrightened by
the prospect of committing them-
selves, they prefer to designate him
as a genius ‘now, instead of leaving
it to future generations to decide,
as some scholars of literature are
wont to do. To them the means
that James Joyce’ has employed in
his book “Ulysses” justiﬁes its end.
the means being multiple conscious
thought of several people of the
lower middle class of Dublin over
the space of one day. By this
means, they believe that he has
succeeded in portraying a realistic
and accurate cross—section of low-
er Dublin life.

It is possible that a simple war
is covering up the death of one of
the greatest living men. A writer
who in time may rank with Shape-
speare and Milton is relegated to
the back pages. “James Joyce,
Irish author . .”

Following the speeches and pre-
sentation of the students’ - gift, Dr.
Bowman arose. 

“I would get along better if
you would not do this,” he said,
adding that nothing in his life had
ever affected him so deeply.

Engraved on the silver tray‘ are
the words:

“This tray and these Royal Crown
Derby teacups are presented to
John Gabbert Bowman by his stu-
dents at the University of Pitts-
burgh on the occasion of his twen-
tieth anniversary as chancellor,
with affection and with the hope
that students may know for many
more years the fellowship and in-
spiration of tea at his ﬁreside.”

Miss Hosey during her speech
prior to presentation of the gift
told Dr. Bowman that everyone
recognizes the greatness of Pitt and
“you, Dr. Bowman have ‘made
Pitt.” Only the best for Pitt has
been ’the;‘Chancellor’s motto, Miss
Hosey asserted. -And Pitt is great

~ not ‘only because of- matetrial struc-

tures,.but”because of what it sym-
bolizes, . Miss -Hos'ey - aadded.

“Dr. Bowmanis responsible for
what we see here today and what

-we shall see..in the future,” Dr.

Clapp said during his speech which
followed introductory remarks by

Roberts. Frick acres, asserted Dr.
Clapp, has risen from a farm to the
most important civic center in the
United States, if notthe world.
-Explaining the progress of the
University, Dr. Shelton told stu-
dents that Dr. Bowman “got us out
of the shacks,” buildings which
housed the University inadequately.

Student committee which ar-
ranged the affair include: Miss

Senior court is credited with orig-
inating the idea of presentation of
the tea set, which consists of 15 cups
and saucers, to Dr. Bowman. He
casually expressed the desire for a
set to be used at ﬁreside chats sev-
eral times.

A committee of leaders in student

‘activities was formed to arrange
the celebration.

All student organizations, publi-
cations, fraternities, social. and‘hon-

Panthers Roll to Easy Victory
Over Bewildered Carnegie

By Arthur Reinstein
It ’s true what. they say about
Tech. The Tartans tried hard to
give an enthusiastic crowd
something to cheer about on the

Tech court VVednesday night but
just didn’t have the class to
s-top Pitt‘ from rolling up an easy
45-30 triumph.

With Malarkey and Port passing
beautifully and Straloski hitting
twice from outside, the Panthers
moved out front from the opening
gun, stretched their lead to 10-0,
and coasted‘ to a 19-10 halftime
lead in.a decidedly below par ex-
hibition of basketball.

Tech Five Ragged

Carnegie’s futile ﬁve gave the
distinct impression of undernour-
ishment in both material and
coaching. The sliding Skibos had
nothing that deserves to be called
a system, and though they picked
up considerably with the second
quarter addition to the lineup bf
Dave Brinn and Wally Patton, their
pitch and pray attack was always
mostly prayer.

Pitt was not too good. The Pan-
thers learned a few bad habits
from the Tartans that they hadn’t
seen before, but they seemed to be
able to turn on the pressure and
shake loose Malarkey or Straloski
in payoff territory.

The Tech boys started the sec-

ond half at top speed, setting up
a close-checking defense. that had
the Panthers in trouble for a few
minutes.
Panthers Pour it On

But Pitt kept making its shots
count. Mel Port and then Lefty
Ziolkowski twice in rapid succes-
sion faked Tartans out of position
for lay-up shots and Jimmy Klein
ﬁred one through from mid-court.

And the Panthers chose this night
to improve their foul shooting at

sided 14-0 margin.

This season, the Blue and Gold
diamond athletes are well prepared
to pay off many of the defeats hand-
ed them last year. With the large
number of veterans returning from
the 1940 squad, added to a group of
promising sophomores, it is almost
certain that the Pitt baseballers
will more than hold their own in
collegiate baseball circles. The cur-
rent squad of Panthers are more
than certain to better last season’s
mark of two wins against 10 de-
feats.

Rely on Jones

Perhaps the only pre-season
weak spot in the Pitt nine is the
pitching department. Here the
Panthers will bank almost wholly
upon the» arm of footballer Eddie
Jones who suffered an elbow in-
jury last year and had to "be trans-
ferred to outﬁeld duty. In addi-
tion to Jones, Coach Mitterling will
rely upon Eddie Haluska, sopho-
more Joe Chuirazzi, and Joe Pom-
merscheim.

Behind the bat, the ‘Pitt nine will
probably be much better supplied
than they were in years past. With
letterman Guy Guadagnino return-
ing, and with sophomore Art Baris-
ka coming along quickly, the Panth-
ers should have little trouble in the
catching department.

The Panther batterymen have al-
ready reported «to Coach Mitterling
for preliminary workouts. Actual
practice willnot reallyfget under

the expense of the Tartan’s close-
guarding defense.

When the fourth quarter start-
ed the basketball stopped for the
evening. Aside from a couple of
long heaves by .Burch and Patton.
the Skibos did practically nothing
at all, while Pitt seemed uncertain
whether to practice their long pass-
ing game or to give everybody some
points. _

Pitt was always so far the bet-
ter team that the 15 point margin
is an understatement.

Doc Carlson cleared his bench
in the last minutes of play, every-
one but the injured Sam Milanovich
getting into the action.

Most important news of the night
was the continued improvement
shown by Panther reserves Malar-
key and Ziolkowski. Sophomore
Tay passed smartly, as usual, and
with added experience should
match Mel Port in ﬂawless ﬂoor
work. Junior Eddie scored twice,
once from the wrong side, on neat
work under the hoop.

Too Easy

The victory was, at best, a hol-
low one. Aside from the spirit of
the student body, the antics of all-
American Cheerleader Al Minetti,
and a neat blackout baton-twirling
act by a big Skibo dressed like a
royal mountie, Tech had this: one
boy, Dave Brinn, who threw a big
monkey wrench into the Carlson
system by playing a scrarnbling,
ﬁghting zone while the other four
boys played a man-for-man de-
fense; one good shooter, Wally Pat-
ton. and no system to get the ball
to him.

The bad company almost ruined
the Panthers, but they played just
enough good basketball to take
their sixth victory of the season
and keep the Carnegie Skibos in
the niche Pitt basketball teams
have generally reserved for them.

Minor Sports Hold
Two-Day Spotlight
In Intramurals

The minor sports, volleyball and
table tennis, will dominate a very
weak weekend as competition in
the fraternity league sloughs off.
This will give the various basket-
ball teams in the Greek circuit a
few days to recover fromla rather
strenuous week, a week which saw
the three leading teams of
league, the Phi Kaps, Phi Gams,
and Sammies, keep abreast of each
other.

Entertainment so far as basketball
goes will be furnished by the inde-
pendents and engineers, who thus
far this season have failed to show
much interest in their games. Most
of the games have resulted in for-
feits and double forfeits. For this
reason a more comprehensive pre-
view of their contests cannot be
given.

Lack of interest in such sports
as badminton, table tennis, volley-
ball and the like can be under-
stood. But lack of_inter_e_st in bas-
ketball, football, and ‘softball is‘ a

way, however, until after the ﬁnal mystery Whlch not even Ellery ‘

Playing the same brand of ball
they have displayed all season, the
“ﬁve iron men” of Sigma Alpha
Mu remained undefeated after
Tuesday night’s encounter with the
Kappa Sigs, despite the valiant ef-
forts of George Kracum.

Besides leading the Kappa Sig
ﬁve in scoring for the evening, Kra-
cum was a bear on the defense as
he tried to inspire his mates to cut
down the high flying Neville street
quintet, which won, 33-25. Hack

White led the Sammie scoring for
the evening with 12 points, while
Kracum had 10.

With Jack Glenn scoring 10
points, as many as the entire Pi
Lam ﬁve, the Phi Kaps also kept
their record spotless as they swamp-
ed Specs Greenberg and This team-
mates, 27-10. As they continue to
sink all opposition, the Phi Kaps
seem to be an odds-on favorite to
recapture the Greek league crown.

In the best game of the evening,
the SAEs nosed out the Delts 23-20.

again last night.

ﬁve forfeited to the Upper Dent-

and McNaughton.

The Panther hockey athletes of
the past already have applied to
the Amateur Athletic union for
jurisdiction to perform as an ama-
teur unit. Attempts are being
made to play contests with other
squads in neighboring states.

Take Case to Hagan

Plans for the formation of the
team followed attempts ' by the
players to receive a deﬁnite answer
to their queries submitted to ath-
letic director James Hagan last fall
on the status of hockey at the Uni-
versity.

Several of the athletes took their
case to the athletic officials aand at-
tempted to discover what would be
done in the way of providing for a
hockey team at Pitt. The only
deﬁnite information which they re-
ceived was that until a student ac-
tivities center is provided, hockey
will lnwe to be abandoned.

The decision on the part of Pitt
athletic officials to terminate in
1939 their two year membership in
the Penn-Ohio hockey league fol-
lowed repeated attempts to arrange
better facilities as well as more
collegiate control. Pitt dropped
from the league following the 1938-
39 season and as yet ofﬁcials have
expressed no definite opinion as to
when the sport would re resumed.
Supports Hagan

Following the meeting with Di-
rector of Athletics Hagan, the ath-
letes visited Chancellor Bowman
and again attempted to ﬁnd some
solution to the problem. However,
the Chancellor merely repeated the
decision handed down by Hagan.
He stated, however, that plans for
the proposed student center are rap-
idly being completed.

In addition to the former Panth-
ers, a number of athletes from Car-
negie and Duquesne are participat-
ing in the attempt to organize an
amateur team. The use of the Gar-
dens has been donated to the ath-
letes by the management.

Praises Mrs. Scaife

., Hugh Wing, Secretary of PCTF,
 Thanks Donor of Pitt’s Cyclotron

Mrs. Alan M. Scaife, donor of the University’s $50,000 cyclotron
which will be built soon, has been sent the following letter of apprecia-
-tion, written by Hugh A. Wing, instructor in English and secretary of
the Pittsburgh College Teachers federation:

’ ‘3At the last meeting of the Pitts-
burgh College Teachers federa-
tion, made up of teachers from the
various institutions of higher learn-
ing in Pittsburgh, I, as secretary,
was instructed by the membership
‘to write to you and express our
aglfatiﬁcation for your gift of the
jcyclotron to the University of Pitts-
iburgh.
3 .“Our members at the other uni-
lversities feel that although your
.ﬁne and generous gift went to one
(University, the beneﬁt will be felt
"throughout the district. And not
‘alone by the physicists and medical
specialists who will use it.
{Learned Can Save Country
4 “Many eminent people have com-
«-mented on the value to science and
1medicine of the cyclotron. As an
organization of teachers interested
very deeply in advancing education,
Ewe wish to point out another value.
_ “You have chosen a peculiarly
important time to make this gift.
.;Many people, taking the short View
of the present defense emergency,
are crying for curtailment of edu-
cational services. We hold such
starvation of science, teaching, re-
search, and learning at this time
‘-would be an unwitting betrayal of
[our best interests. If our country
 to be saved, it will be eg‘ a peo-
‘ple more wise in learning; and the
fspirit and will of a people to de-
"ﬁend themselves is tied strongly to
'._‘their belief in the true value of
Ethe society they live in. This time
labove all demands all that can be
?done for the health of the people;
‘likewise the very efforts of the die-
itators to confuse. the American
fgpeople about democracy call for an
‘icexpansion of education, that
'}»through the elimination of illiteracy.
f§4’the growth of understanding, and
i'tlie"appreciati_on of the beneﬁts and
iduties of democracy, our people may
irealize ‘fully’ and clearly! what it, is
?we are defending.‘ The me1nbers'.of
;-‘:the Federation of Teachers feel that
asuch a generous gesture ‘on your
2.-‘part ,ma.,y_a,waken. in ou_r cityna real
-.-sense of "why we need notless edu-
"cation now, but more. If England
‘beset by peril and destruction, can
tin-crease its efforts to keep educa-
7,'tion going; if beleaguered China
‘.«can move its bombed schools and
{.universities two thousand miles to
ifthje west, and increase, rather than
‘decrease the education it gives its
?people in the fact of its national
‘tragedy then surely the richest coun-
3try in the world must keep the

‘Pittslourghers May Follow Example
“Your example may well shame

so greatly been beholden to—science

{ possible, will be encouraged by your
"action to provide those other pre-

Smyrna is located at the head
of the rift valley structure of Afri-
ca which is the largest fault area
on the earth’s surface. “From Bi-
blical times there have been earth-
quakes in this area, and there al-
ways will be,” says Bradford.

Library Loan Service Sends,
Borrows Books for University

For more than ten years, un-
known to many of the University
students, the reference department
of the University library under su-
pervision of Miss Leona A. Gar-
lock, has carried on an Inter—Li-
brary Loan service.

This service consists mainly of
lending books to libraries in the
United States and in many foreign
countries. Any material which the
University does not contain, the
loan service borrows from libra-
ries in the United States and for-
eign countries.

Roosevelt Lowers Rates

4 Thisgservice, available only to
University professors, ’ instructors
and graduate students, carries with
it just postage charge. The recent
lowering of postal charges on books
by President Roosevelt has made
the ‘cost of inter-library loans very
small. ' '

During the 1939-1940 school year
the library borrowed 262 books
from 56 "different libraries ‘in the
United States. These books,’ “con-
sisted, to the greatest extent, of
magazines, journals, and, foreign
language books on all subjects.

The lending program is as great
as the borrowing section. Two hun-
dred and four University library

books were loaned from 126 six dif-
ferent libraries in the United States,
Canada, France, Spain and H01-
land.
Most Popular Thesis

Greatest amount of material bor-
rowed from University are theses
written by the graduate students.
The most popular thesis is on “The
Survey of Twenty University Place-
ment Bureaus” written by Edward
Linhart in 1935. '

The Inter-Library Loan service
has iound that the major part of
its borrowing and lending has been
with such libraries as the Library
of Congress, University of Chicago
library, and Princeton University
library. Together with these libra-
ries and others in the United States,
the University library has 2‘made

“available, for the length of two

‘years, material which previous to
inauguration of this service was
not available; 1

E8, the smoke’s the thing! After all,

you don't get anything from a ciga-
rette until you’ve lighted it . . . until it’s
burning. And there is the secret of an
advantage Camel smokers have enjoyed
for years. For Camel’s costlier tobaccos
are slower-burning.

Slower-burning for more coolness
and mildness—-for Camels are free from
the excess heat and irritating qualities
of too-fast burning. Slower-burning for

R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. Winston-Salem. North Carolina

more ﬂavor because slow burning pre-
serves tobacco ﬂavor and fragrance.

Now Science conﬁrms still another
advantage——less nicotine in the smoke-
less than any of the four other largest-
selling brands tested . . . 28% less than
the average!

Make Camels your steady smoke and
enjoy all the advantages that only
Camel’s slower burning . . . costlier to-
baccos can give—even economy (see left).
