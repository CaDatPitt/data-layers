Dr. Bowman Presents Plans To-

1,000 Alumni Members At
Charter Day Meeting

I

I)r. John G. Bowman, Chancellor of
the University, expects the Cathedral
fund drive to be well under way early
next week. With the goal of the cam-
paign set at $1,650,000 he is hopeful’
of seeing the first 20 ﬂoors of the
building, including the commons
room, fully completed and the top 20
roughly ﬁnished within a year.

Before a group of over 1,000 alumni
attending the Charter day celebration
of the General Alumni association at
the Hotel Schenley Dr. Bowman ﬂung
the challenge to alumni to give and
to cooperate with the University in
this drive to complete our “tall build-
ing.”

Dr. Bowman opened his talk, which
was broadca.st over WWSW, by an-
nouncing the CWA program would
cont.inue with a full force until May 1.
After giving a brief resume of the
growth of the Cathedral and the past
campaign for funds which netted
$9,100,000, he announced the plan of
the University to have Homer D. Wil-
liams, who was chairman of that
drive as chairman of the new drive.

“The desire that the Cathedral of
Learning be ﬁnished is in the air,”
said Dr. Bowman, “and its completion
will be the beginning of a new era in
education at the University.”

There is to be no separate alumni
solicitation, Pitt’s graduates being
asked to take part as individuals in
an activity which it is believed will
unite the endeavors of all elements
of the community_

If the University can complete con-
struction and equipment of the ﬁrst
20 floors and “rough ﬁnish” the higher
ones, all the students now attending
classes on the old campus, save those
studying medicine, dentistry and
chemistry, will be transferred to the
Cathedral.

Dr. Alexander Silverman, head of
the department of chemistry, ad-
dressed the alumni on “Alumni Op-
portunities.” The value of extensive
research laboratories, of libraries,
works of art and of museums to
further the value of the University
were stressed by Dr. Silverman.

Before the general meeting the
various constituent associations of the
Alumni association held separate din-
ner meetings in various rooms of the
hotel. At the college Alumni associa-
tion dinner the oldest alumni of the
University was Henry T. Morris of the
class of ’69. He entered the Western
University of Pennsylvania in 1865.

The Men’s Glee club octet sang
“Sing me a Chantey" and “Indian
Serenade.”

An Editorial

A Job For Experts

HE CITY OF PITTSBURGH is facing a crisis. Its council

is having diﬂiculty with the city budget. Delinquent taxes
are piling higher as taxpayers find economic conditions pro-
hibitive to expenditures other than those for food and shelter.
The city’s mayor, elected by voters who wanted action and
definite results, by his own admission does not know what to
do. Because of the lack of executive leadership there is little
coordination among the vital departments of the city. Pitts-
burgh, potentially one of the richest cities in the world, ﬁnds
itself facing a crisis. And the solution of Pittsburgh ’s prob-
lems is a job for experts.

The l.'niversity of Pittsburgh, one of the city ’s most valu-
able assets, has these experts and should provide them volun-
tarily for the solution of the city ’s problems. Experts in taxa-
tion, in municipal budget, in city administration, in every
phase of municipal government are on the staff? of the Univer-
sity. They e men with considerable knowledge of the city ’s
problems, they are the best-ini’ormed mcn in‘Pittsburgh on
municipal affairs. They are not city executives, they are ex.-
perts. They probably cannot put their suggestions into action,
but their advice is invaluable.

HE TALENT AND EXPERIENCE of this corps of cx.perts

ought to be at the service of Pittslmrgll in this crisis. As
the center of intellectual pursuits in the city, the University
owes this service to its comminiity, a community which ﬁnds
itself terribly ill and has not the physician to prescribe a
remedy.

The services of the University’s experts should be volun-
tarily oifercd to Pittsburgh. It matters little in what manner
this comes about. A Committee on Municipal Affairs can be
organized by these men in the economics and political science
departments who can offer their services. The mayor himself
might ask that a group of experts be formed. Public agencies,
newspapers and civic clubs, can easily get action started.

RESIDENT ROOSEVELT SET a- notable example with his

selection of university experts to diagnose the nation ’s ills.
Certainly Mayor 1\IcNair should not be opposed to such pro-
cedure. He commands an enviable position in this respect
since he is automatically a member of the University of Pitts-
burgh ’s board of trustees.

Difficulties will undoubtedly arise before these experts can
be regimented to aid the city. \V'e have not considered every
obstacle that might present itself. But we feel that Pitts-
burgh ’s crisis is a job for experts. And we feel that all of us
in Pittsburgh are interested in Pittsburgh’s welfare.

Engineers, Not News, To Blame For
Obscurity, Says Cabinet’President

8 1‘

In a statement absolving the Pitt News for any blame in the obscurity of
the Engineering association cabinet on the campus, George Henderson, presi-
dent of the cabinet, said, “it is primarily the fault of the engineers.”

Henderson further stated, “No other school in the University can equal
the record of organization that the engineers have established in three years.
It the engineers let their departmental representatives know what they want
rand stand behind the cabinet’s decisions, they can have a better representa-
ition than any other group on the¢
campus.”

Plans under consideration by the.
{Engineers cabinet, at present are: ;

funds have been accumulating for the;

In outlining the organization of the
cabinet and its activities in his state 
ment, Henderson wrote, “The cabinet:

It has been found in the past that;
this method of representation elimi-;
nates to a great extent the politics
and jealousies that appear in all rep-i
resentative bodies. Working in co-
operation with the Alumni associa—,
tion, the cabinet has done a great!
deal to further the Engineering asso-
ciation.”

The activities sponsored by the cab-
inet to date include: the senior
award, the outstanding senior from-
each department being chosen by al
faculty committee on a basis of schol-
arship, sociability, practicality, and
leadership; and a dance, a smoker,

The Hour Of Decision

NIVERSITY STUDENTS of :1 liberal trend, students

who see in collectivism and social control the next
step in world civilization, will be interested in the view-
point of Oswald Spengler in his recently—publisl1ed “The
Hour Of Decision.”

It was not the \Vorld ‘War, nor the evils inherent in
the (Iapitalist systeni, nor the machine era, nor over-
production that induced our present ills, Mr. Spengler be-
lieves. All these misfortunes, he insists, are superﬁcial
phenomena. The real evil is over two centuries old: it
is the growth of the democratic idea, with its logical se-
quence of liberalism, socialism, communism, bolshevism.

The rise of the masses, says Spengler, means the ile-
gradation of societ_v——ﬁrst culturally, then politically and
econoniically, Only :1 return to “Prussianism”——to the
neglected ideals of military virtue. unselﬁsh dedication to
the State. and discipline—ca.n hope to save the day.

PENGLER SEES DANGER for the white races not

A only from within but also from without: Russia has
gone Asiatic, he says; Japan is preparing to dominate
the Paciﬁc; and if the white world does not throw off
its ills, the next century will bring on a “Colored Revo-
lution” which will destroy the- whites. To avert this
ruin, Mr. Spengler announces that Germany must lead
Europe in 3 rcnascence of \Vestern morale: she alone
has preserved the Prussian virtues which are demanded.

Of particular interest to students who are in college
tozlziv is Spenglei-‘s announcement that the approaching
decade will decide the course of world history. More
interesting than that is Spengler‘s announcement that
lmppiness cannot be hoped for in this transition and men
will be unhappy and destitute. A brilliant future for the
classes of "3/l, ’35, ’36. and ’37! “As for those who seek
(-omfort merely,” says Spengler, “they do not deserve to
exist.”

HE KNELL OF COLl.EC'l‘IVlSM is sounded in
Spengler’s astounding publication. offering argument
after argument in support of military discipline and a
new social order which he calls Faustian Civilization.

"because “preparedness admits the inevitabilitv of
war.” Under no conditions are we to take part in an

- that we should maintain only the “necessary minimum”
‘ of defensive weapons. ”

obviously in tribute to his favorite writer, Goethe. An
interesting, controversial, and wholly intelligent view-
point is Spengler’s, offering diversion from the liberal
students’ pratings on collectivism. Certainly the demo-
cratic ideal can be given a sound lashing to the enjoy-
ment of many of us.

Prophetically speaking of coming events, Spengler
writes: “In this age of transition, of formlessness ‘be-
tween the ages,’ which is probably still far short of the
summit of confusion and passing forms, new tendencies
pointing toward the distant future are faintly outlining
themselves.

5; HE POWERS VVHICH ARE destined to wage the

final war for supremacy on the planet are begin-
ning to shape themselves into form and position; only
one of them can give the lmperium Mundi its name, and
that provided that no terrible fate destroys it before
completion.

“Nations of a new order are about to rise which are
not those of today, summations of individuals of equal
1'3~11k and 0f like Slleech; not as those of yesterday, which,
as in the Renaissance, are recognized with an assurance
that rested on the style, the soul of it, a painting, a bat-
tle. a face. an idea, a form of moral outlook and opinioni
as It.a.lia.n~—although there was as yet no Italian State in 
existence. The Faustian nations of the end of the twen-l
‘tieth century will be elective affinities of men with 21‘
common feeiing about life, with the same imperatives of
a strong will and naturally with the same language, but:
witliout their knowledge of that language constituting’
either :1 hallmark or limitation.”

Student Letters

February 26, 1934.

Editor, Pitt News.
Dear Sir: -

I wish to call to your attention several points in vour
editorials, printed in recent issues of the Pitt News
vrhicli are inconsistent. In your enthusiasm or vour lack
of knowledge of the subject, you have committed several
glaring offenses.

In the issue of February 16, you stated that “the pitt-
News editorial policy is paciﬁstic and in support of dis.
armament.” You continued that “preparedness admits
the inevitability of war” and that “we can see no reason
for our nation taking part in warfare.” How do you
reconcile the above statements with the one in a follow-
ms‘ Damsraph in which you said “we believe that we
should defend our homes and our nation?” These con-
tradictory points represent the height: of inconsistency
M1“. Editor. In other words, we are to scrap our navy’
disband our army, and destroy all our military weapons:

armed conﬂict, because “we can see no reason for our
nations taking part in warfare.” Yet, with absolutely no i
means of defense, because we do not advocate prepared- ‘
ness, and since it is against our paciﬁstic convictions,

we are to defend our homes and our nation.” How do
you propose to do this, Mr. Editor? You stated further

Has a. “necessary minimum” ever

been established in any of the disarmament conferences

that was satisfactory to all the nations concerned? The

attempts to establish this standard has caused continual ,
international jealousy and discord among the major‘
powers of Europe. Meanwhile the armed forces of the
United States are far below the minimum established by
the treaties and pacts to which this nation is a signatory.
All the other powers have maintained their navies and
armies at treaty strength and some of them, especialiy
Japan, demand an increase in the number of ﬁghting
ships they are allowed to maintain under the London
agreement. VVith these obvious facts continually claim-
ing public attention, you ridiculed the President in an-
other editorial for his attempts to build up the American
navy to a standard approaching treaty strength. Yet you
say you believe we should defend our nation.

In another editorial several weeks ago. you commented
on the action of “the brave (‘.’) Pitt students” who fought
in the ‘World War. It is now very easy to take a. smug,
paciﬁstic attitude and mock and scorn those who served
their country in 1917-1918, but did you ever stop to think
what your position today would be if they had not
come to its defense. Perhaps you would not be receiv-
ing a liberal education in American universityand have
the privilege of freely expressing your views, Mr. Editor.

In order that there be no misunderstanding, I wish to

Street Car Rates

Advises Students To Present Case
For Lower Fa.-res

Magee Discusses 

 

 

Commenting on the question of re-
duced trolley rates for students, W'il-
liam A. Magee, Inquiry forum speaker,
Vvednesday said: ‘‘It will be neces-
sary for the student body committee
handling this question for the Univer-
sity to prepare a case and present
that case to the Public Service com-
mission. One of the points you would
have to prove in your argument would
be: VVould enough students patron-
ize the cars at the lower rate to com-
pensate for the reduction in fares?"

Mr. Magee told of the public’s ﬁght
to gain better fare rates, presenting
both the public’s case and that of
the utilities. He believes that the
real problem of fair utility rates lies
in the co-ordination of the various
factions of consumers into a central
unit to protest unfair rates of public
utilities.

Dr. B_ J. Hovde, associate professor
of history, will address next week's
forum on “Problems of Modern
Europe.”

Inaugural Day Dinner’

Fashions!

Senior Women Pick Dress
For Commencement

Jackets, little frilly ﬁtted jackets,
and long dashing swagger jackets,
were the keynote of fashion which
featured the senior women’s style
show on Wednesday at Heinz House.

Plans are being made for the YVVCA

March 6, at Heinz House from 5:30 to
8 o’clock. The program, as yet tenta-
tive, centers around the inauguration
of Miss Katherine Dulfield, traveling

tional inaugural day program.

All -Women Should Sign at the The purpose of the style show was
7 xv .. _ i ,-, ‘
 Ofhce before Monday at ° to select two uniform dresses for the
1\-

seniors to wear to all activities of
Senior week.

VVhite dresses of all types and
descriptions were shown by the fifteen
models, with the Seniors, after much
discussion, selecting the two gowns
modeled by Florence Price and Natalie
Hagen. Each girl will have the priv-
ilege after of choosing the dress best
suited to her taste, which she will
wear to all the activities of Senior
week.

Price was of the higli-waisted type“
designed for slender girls, with :1 half!

A jacket, with bell-shaped sleeves

Hagen’s dress. The dress itself had
a vionnet neck, which may be worn
buttoned up or thrown back as a
lapel. Pleats in the front and back,
that of course are the latest thing in
smartness, probably accounted for its
selection.

Pitt News Sports Editor

The Carnegie Tech Tartan a few days ago announced that it was in-

formed that the Pitt News was going to throw an article about Russ Lind-I
berg, Panther swimmer, back in its face.

nothing back in nobody’s face.

 

And in reply to their question, we
wouldn't give a ﬁg or a Tech Tartan
to know what famous Carnegie grid-
iron star is now enrolled at t11e Pitt
night school.

 

Last year, freshman swimming
coach George Lee took a young man
by the name of Lee Mosena from a
freshman swimming class and (level-
oped him into one of the stars on last
year's frosh team, So, what happens
but Mi: Mosena transfers to good old
Carnegie and is now the brighest
light on the Tech freshman swimming
team. Congratulations, Carnegie!

 

The advent of freshman wrestling
here has thus far received a cold wel-
come from the ﬁrst year men of the
University. If more interest is not
shown the scheduled wrestling
matches may be canceled and the
sport may be eliminated from the
freshman calendar,

The coaching staff is especially in-
terested in the freshman team be-
cause it provides a good opportunity
for the wrestlers to get much needed
experience. Lack of experience
seems to be the varsity‘s chief l1andi-
cap this year.

 

Football Coach Dr. John B. Suther-
land and his staff are conducting
meetings of the football players daily
at the Stadium. Each player attends
one meeting a week, One night is
set aside for the halfbacks, one for
the centers, one for the ends, and so
on for each position. Although Dr.
Sutherland is present at all the meet-

ings he is paying special attention to

the quarterbacks,

 

Although few people know it, quite
a few athletes make their homes in
the Track house. Here the boys
bunk and board for the sake of good
old economy.

Among those staying here that they
might continue their education are
Harold Tost and Robert Gerrety, frosh
track stars; the Hughes brothers,
Noon, Cribbs and VVainio, basketball
players; Charles Gongloff, Emil Bona-
vita, and Pete Avizienis, football and
track stars,

Gongloff, Bonavita,
even have a private
they use it.

Delta Tau Delta
Leads Frat Loop

Defeat Phi Gains In Overtime
Game; Hartwig Outstanding

and Wainio
shower_ Yes,

 

The three games played VVednes-
day night in League “B” of the inter-
fraternity basketball league left Del-
ta Tau Delta still on top and brought
about a three way tie for second be-
tween Lambda Chi Alpha, Kappa Sig-
ma, and Phi Gamma Delta,

Fine teamwork won for Lamba Chi
Alpha in the opener, over Sigma Al-
pha 1\Iu, with most of their points
being tallied from within the foul
line. The Sigma Alpha Mu ﬁve tried
long shot after long shot, many of
them from the middle of the ﬂoor,
but most of them bounced harmlessly
off the backboard into the hands of
the opposition.

Golanty looked good for the losers
as he scored ten points, and Kalle-
way starred for the victors.

The next game was the featrue of
the night as it brought together the
well-matched quintets of Delta Tau
Delta and Phi Gamma Delta.

The spirit with which the contest
was fought is well shown by the fact
that the teams were tied in score
three times, seven all at the half; 12
each in the last quarter with but ﬁve
minutes left; and then again at the
end of the regular time, 21 apiece.

With both teams and spectators as
well worked up to a, high pitch of ex-
citement, the two teams went into an
extra period. Delta Tau Delta began
sinking them from all angles with
“Doc” |Hartwig and “Bo-b” Hogan do-
ing most of the heavy work. Phi
Gamma Delta could not quite match
the zip of the inspired league leaders.

Hartwig, was far and away the
leading man of this and all the match-
es as he ripped the meshes for 15
points and otherwise made life mis-
erable for the losers.

The only thing that a marred the
game was roughness, which may or
may not have been due to the keen
competition which marked the play
from the opening to the ﬁnal whistle.

Any game after that, was of course
rather tame, but Kappa Sigma dis-

Panthers Invade
Philly To Meet
Owls Tomorrow

Golden Cats Go After Seventh
Eastern Intercollegiate
Conference Triumph

 

Calm and conventional Quaker City
will quake tomorrow night whe11 the
Pitt Panther and the Temple Owl
meet to settle anold difference at the
Temple gym. Those local fans who
sat in on the ﬁrst Panther—Owl en-
gagement here at the Stadium pavilion
‘may well understand just why the fur
is due to ﬂy in Philadelphia tomorrow_

\Vith Skip Hughes leading the pro-
cession Dr. Carlson’s men nosed out
Coach Jimmy Usilton’s quintet in a
hot game, 35-30. The Owls put on one
of the most brilliant and entertaining
[exhibitions of meaning seen here in
Lmany a day and this not without some
Icause. Most of the difﬁculty was
laroused by the well-known “block-
,play,” which shakes a man free for
13. shot because the opponent guard-
ling that man has been physically
blocked out of the play. Naturally,
there is bodily contact involved in
such a play and it seems that the
lEastern teams and the Western teams
have different ideas about who is re-
sponsible for the obvious foul. All of
which may make it more than inter-
esting to observe what happens down
east in Philly.

Temple has a better than average
ball club this season and, among other
things, holds down third place in the
Eastern Intercollegiate conference
standings. The Owls boast four vic-
tories as against three defeats in the
loop, which the Panthers are leading
with six wins and no setbacks. Tem-
ple recently recovered from a licking
at the hands of Duquesne to humble
Carnegie Tech’s frequently humbled
Tartans last week.

Jimmy Brown, Owl center, has
been starring for the Philadelphians
this season. Although small for a
pivot man, Brown makes up for his
lack of size by heady, brilliant ﬂoor
work and accurate shooting. Fox and
Rosan are two high—class forwards,
who can pass and shoot for the hoop
with great efﬁciency_ Messikomer,
Frieberg and Casper are dependable
guards at Coach Usilton’s disposal.

Although it is not likely that Claire
Cribbs will see action tomorrow,
Charley Hughes’ ailing guard, may get
back into the game. In that event
Carlson will use his original starting
ﬁve with the exception of Noon in
place of Cribbs. Should Charley
Hughes not be able to play, then the
revised lineup will send Don Mc-
Camant to guard with Ochsenhirt
while Roderick will pair up with Skip
Hughes at the forwards. Pete Noon
will perform at center in any case,

The game tomorrow night affords
the Panthers a ﬁne opportunity to
“show off" before the Philadelphia
sports scribes who, as rumor hath it,
are still open-mouthed after the class
Duquesne showed in walloping the

Owls. The lineup:

Waynesburg To Alford Panthers
Final Mat Test Of Year

 

The Panther wrestlers defeated the
Tartan matmen in the Tech gym
Tuesday night by a score of 31 to 5.
Pitt won seven of the eight weight
matches, one on a forfeit in the 115-
pound class. Bernard Penner, i11 his
first competitive match, lost to the
much more experienced and ﬁnished
wrestler, Hill, of Tech.

Two Pitt football players came
through with victories, Nicksick won
the 175-pound match for the Panthers
and Detzel, wrestling in the unlimited
class, defeated Forsman, Teck tackle.

Tonight the team will compete in
its ﬁnal collegiate match of the sea-
son when it meets the Waynesburg
Yellow Jackets at Vvaynesburg.

Should the team win the match it
will have compiled a worthy record
of two victories and two defeats,
which is not at all a bad record con-
sidering the fact that this is the first
year that the sport was placed on
the Varsity sport calendar.

The Pitt team that meets VVaynes-
burg will be composed of practically
the same men that wrestled in the
Tech match, providing the VVa_vnes—
burg coaches permit a three-pound
weight extension.

1 Two Games For Week-End

In The high-riding Panther freshman
;basketball team is in for a busy week-
lend. Tonight Coach Paul Zehfuss will
take his men to Edgewood for a game
with the Vvestern Pennsylvania
School for the Deaf. This aggregation
recently made a good showing in the
tournament for Institutes of the Deaf
at New York,

Saturday the freshmen will journey
to Kiskiminetas Springs school where
they will play a return game with the
Kiski ﬁve. The little Panthers
humbled the Saltsburg boys in the
game here and should have little dif-
ﬁculty in repeating the trick.

A last-minute ﬁeld goal by Billy
Jesko was the margin which gave the
Fresh 21 42-41 victory over the Tech
,Plebes in the preliminary game Tues-
lday. Jesko also featured the scoring
»’with twelve points in a game which
marked the second triumph for the
little Panthers over their rivals.

Relay Team Out
l Of IC4A Meet

The injury bugaboo which has al-
ready wrecked its havoc with the
Panther basketball team, now has de-
scended upon the Pitt trackmen and
consequently throws out of order Coach
Olson’s plans for the ICAAAA indoor
meet in New York Monday_

Olson was counting heavily upon
his crack relay team to bring home a
share of the glory from this well-
known track affair, but an injury to
Bill M,cMunn, sophomore speedster,
has left the relay team with only three
men available. Mclvlunn sustained a
leg—muscle injury in the VVest Vir-
ginia meet Saturday and will be out
of action for several days. Olson has
no dependable substitute whom he
may throw i11to the breach with any
fair chance of coming out ahead in
such high—class competition as will be
found in the New York meet.

The scratching of the relay team
leaves Ken Wagenhouser, a. sensa-
tional miler and two miler, as Pitt’s
only probable entry in Gotham on
Monday. Wagenhouser has coasted to
victory in every important distance
,run he has entered this indoor sea-
’son, climaxing his performance with
a 4333.5 mile at the animal Pitt in-
door games. This remarkable time
lshattered an eight-year old track
fhouse mark. \N’agenhouser was also
;the leading scorer on Pitt’s undefeated
;cross-country outﬁt last fall.

Olson plans to enter his crack dis-
ltance man in the 3,000' meter run of
!the Intercollegiate association meet.
} This distance is only slightly under a
gregular two-mile run and ought to
Lgive Wagenhouser an opportunity to

3 show his best form.

Pitt Beats Tech
Nineteenth Time

 

For the nineteenth consecutive time
Pitt's Golden Panthers came out on
the long end of the score in a basket-
ball game with Carnegie Tech’s Tar-
tans. The Pitt boys won rather handily
over Tech Tuesday night in the Tech
gym, 44-30.

Led by Skip Hughes, McC-amant and
Ochsenhirt, Cal‘lSon’s men piled up a
safe lead in the early stages of the
game and maintained it throughout.

One incident of the game which
brought a cheer from the Pitt fol-
lowers was the entrance into the game

of Charley Hughes. The dependable
guard and co-captain has been ailing
since just before the last Notre Dame
game, and his Tuesday night appear-
ance was his ﬁrst time in uniform
since then.
