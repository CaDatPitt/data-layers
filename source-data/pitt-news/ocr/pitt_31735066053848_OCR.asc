Pitt students at a fraternity party on
Halloween night, breaking their
noses and inﬂicting other injuries.

On Monday, Deputy Pitt
Police Chief Gary Moses con-
firmed McMu1len's arrest on
Friday but‘ would not discuss
details of the incident pending fur-
ther investigation.

Ron Wahl, the assistant athlet-
ics director of public relations, said
no action will be taken until further
progress is made in the probe.

‘'1 just became aware of the
situation recently. We will let due

"It's up to Coach

McMullen saw
playing time as a
tight end earlier in
the football season,
but injured his
knee and is out
indeﬁnitely. He could not be

As seconds ticked away on the
clock yesterday evening, candidates
for the SGB presidency struggled to
get their plans for ofﬁce across to the
50-member audience at the William
Pitt Union Ballroom.

Holding the SGB presidential
debate on Monday gave the candi-
dates an opportunity to question one
another on the hottest topics of the
election, which will be held on
Wednesday.

The debate’s format allowed
each of the presidential candidates to
prepare one question for each of their
fellow candidates. When a candidate
received a question, he had two min-
utes to respond, after which the can-
didate who formulated the question
had one minute to respond.

The most provocative questions
addressed topics such as campus
unity, allocations, candidates‘ qualiﬁ-
cations and women’s issues.

David Teeters asked Alyson

at the. organization's first-ever meeting last night in the Union.

Two new organizations
form in support of workers

James Maude
Staff Writer

Last night, two new student groups
were born: the Student Action Committee
and the Students in Solidarity with Local 29.
These groups will remain in existence until
contract negotiations for Pitt service work-
ers, who are represented by Service
Employees International Union.Local 29,
are ﬁnalized

Fifteen students met in the ﬁfth-ﬂoor
lounge of the William Pitt Union to fonn a
group that will actively tackle student prob-
lems and concerns on the Pitt campus.
Although the group has no political agenda,
the majority of the students are members of
the International Socialist Organization.

"[The purpose of the SAC and SSL29
is] to draw students into action," said ISO
member Barbara Kline. "A lot of students
are angry. This is a forum through which
they can organize, and show active support
for the Local 2 ."

While the student groups plan to
address other issues, their primary one now
is the status of the SEIU Local 29 workers,
who are still working without a contract.

This explains the formation of the SSL29

wing of the SAC.

"[We want] to build student support for
Local 29 and their contract ——- the contract it
deserves," said John Lacny, ISO member
and SSL29 organizer.

Pitt student Tom Cmar said "the pur-
pose of the SAC is to serve as an indepen-
dent forum for students to get involved with
the Pitt community."

At the meeting, the students discussed
what they could do to help the workers and
to promote their cause around campus. For
the moment, this includes picketing around
campus and signing petitions.

The SAC plans to hold a panel discus-
sion on Wednesday, Nov. 19. It has invited
professors from Pitt and Columbia
Umversity —— where maintenance workers
were on strike recently —— as well as local

labor leaders, and rank—and-ﬁle maintenance
workers. The gathering will discuss the Pitt
maintenance workers‘ contract negotiations,
and what role the Pitt community has in this
issue.

After much discussion, a rudimentary
constitution has been drawn up for the SAC,
and over the next week, it will complete the
student-group registration process. The SAC
will also search for a faculty sponsor,
although Kline assured the members that
this would not be a problem

"We'll have to appoint a president, a
vice president and another oﬁicer," said
Kline. "I mean, how bourgeois."

Cmar said the SAC members wanted to
be taken seriously as a student group, espe-
cially in light of the recent Allocations
Committee scandal, which might involve
bogus student organizations.

But for now, the SAC will resort to
"underground and guerilla" tactics to
achieve its goals. Kline and Lacny both
stressed that any student, from any sociopo-
litical background, race or gender, can join,
and that it is not a socialist organization.

"The ISO has been doing most of the
work so far," said Lacny. "We're aiming for
broader appeal. We want to get more people
involved."

Amanda Schulz, a proud SAC member,
said, "After everything's done with the
union, we'll go on to tackle issues such as the
cutbacks in University faculty and other
things pissing students off."

Kline added, "Workers and students at
Pitt are in the same boat: workers by a crap-
py contract, and students by the downsizing
of the curriculum. [The administration] is
piling work on the teaching assistants,
because they're cheap labor."

Until they acquire a formal meeting
place, the SAC and SSL29 will meet every
Monday at 8:00 p.m. in the William Pitt
Union's ﬁfth~ﬂoor lounge.

The SSL29's home page, which Lacny
describes as rudimentary, is located at
www.pitt.edu/~jplstl5/ssl29.html. «

were on the panel which spoke in frontof the Human Rights Campaign on Sunday.

WlrenCandaceGingricli,agayandles-

theHouse Newt Gingrich,thatshewasales-
bian, he didn't seem to object.

But one day when Newt was cam-
paigning for re-election to Congress,
Candace read a newspaper article that
detailed her brother's opposing political
stand on homosexual‘ lifestyles.

"I was awoken from my blissful igno-
rance in 1994," she said "I saw Newt's now
infamous comments on homosexuality in a
newspaper that Thanksgiving. He said that it
was madness to believe families are any-
thing else but heterosexual couples. I was
more a reactionist than an activist then."

This past Sunday, she spoke to a group
of students and community members at a
townhallmeeting heldintheFrick FineArts
Building auditorium

The public statements made by her
brother motivated Candace Gingrich to
become a gay and lesbian activist

Candace Gingrich is now on a 52-city,
six—month tour for the Human Rights
Campaign, a political-action group working
for gay and lesbian rights. She is working to
educate the public about gays and lesbians
and the political issues that confront them.

Gingrich discussed the goals of the
Human Rights Campaign, but not before she
gave a personal account of her own coming-
out story and of her relationship with her
broﬂrer, Newt.

"When you come out, you often turn
ignorance into understanding and support."
Gingrich said.

Gingrich noted that she always knew
she was different but didn't openly discuss
her lesbianism until she was in college, at
Indiana University of Pennsylvania.

Newt Gingrich ﬁrst reacted to her sexu-
al orientation by telling her it was her life and

thatshehadtherighttoliveitthewayshe
desired, but she realized he felt diﬂ’erently
while he was campaigning for congression-
al re-election.

Gingrich explained she was reluctant to

becorrre an activist for several years because
she didn't want to "risk losing my family's
love and support by damaging Newt's
Cam ll -
Gingrich was inspired to speak out
againstherbrotlrefs ideals.Nowthatsheisa
spokesperson for the Human Rights
Campaign, she is working to change peo-
ple's feelings toward homosexuals.

"It's neat to go around the country and
let people know gays can come from normal

families," Gingrich said "I encourage peo- V

ple about the message of coming out I want
toclearupthemythsandrnisconceptions
people have about gays and lesbians."

Gingrichqalso addressed issues of les-
bian health, greater protection from discrirn-
ination, and education.

But the political action potential of indi-
vidual persons was her chief focus. Gingrich
said one voice could make a difference.

"People don't realize the power of a let-
teroraphone call to a [congressional] repre-
sentative," Gingrich said ,

Apanel discussion followed her speech.
It consisted of Renee Waughn, a local
Methodist rrrinister who discussed her
church's position on gay marriages; Scott
Saﬁer, who spoke about gay relationships;
Randy Forrester, a gay and lesbian rights
activist; and state Representative Joe Preston
of the 24th District, who discussed legisla-
tion that would protect gay and lesbian
rights. C
After the discussion, Peregin Naylor, a
Pitt sophomore, offered her reaction.

"It was inspiring to hear that Candace
can stand up about who she is even though
she's Newt's sister," Naylor said. "The issues
she spoke about were interesting for me
because they affect my life."

' ll counties to vote today on
tax to fund sports stadium

Across the Nation

PITTSBURGH —— Pirates owner Kevin
McClatchy took to the city's streets yes-
terday in a rally for the controversial
regional sales tax.

McClatchy says the vote“ on the half-
cent tax in 11 counties today will decide
the future of his ball club and that of all of
western Pennsylvania.

McClatchy says he needs a new sta-
dium to effectively compete with other
major league clubs. He can sell the team
if there's no plan in place by next year for
a new stadium.

Ifapproved, thetaxwillraiseabout
$700 million over seven years.

The money will help fund new stadi-
ums for the Pirates ' and the Pittsburgh
Steelers, an expanded convention center
in Pittsburgh and econornic-developrnent
projects in the 11 counties. _

Most polls suggest voters don't sup-
port the tax.

Govemor Tom Ridge says there is no
Plan B for stadiums if the tax is voted
down. -

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — Louise
Woodward's lawyers are making their bid
to spare her from a life in prison. They've
asked a judge in Cambridge to overturn
the jury verdict that found the British
nanny guilty of murder in the second
degree in the death of an 8-montlr-old
boy. The judge has scheduled arguments
on the defense motions tomorrow.

WHEELING, VV.Va. -— A Fairmont

man was sentenced today to time already A

served for conspiracy to manufacture
explosives.

Judge Frederick Stamp Jr. imposed a
sentence of six months on Jack Phillips in
federal court in Wheeling, W.Va Phillips
already served about six months before
he was released on home conﬁnement.

Phillips was the ﬁrst of ﬁve men with
ties to the Mountaineer Militia to be sen-
tenced in federal court. He pleaded guilty
in July and faced a maximum penalty of
ﬁve years in prison.

Prosecutors say the former chemical
engineer was one of two men allegedly
tapped by militia leader Floyd "Ray"
Looker to make explosives for sale and
for use in militia operations.

DENVER —— They planned to murder
innocent people, and their plan worked.

That's how prosecutors are portray-
ing the efforts of Timothy McVeigh and
Terry Nichols.

But in opening statements at Nichols’
trial for the Oklahoma City bombing, his
lawyers said he was at home in Kansas
when the bomb went off.

In attorney Michael Tigars' words,
"Terry Nichols was building life, not a
bomb."

Earlier, a prosecutor said Nichols‘

was a safe distance away from the bomb-
ing only because he had "plarmed it just
that way. "

McVeigh has already been sentenced
to death for the l. 995 bombing that killed
168 people. Nichols faces the same
charges, for allegedly helping to get
money for the bombing, helping to build
the bomb and helping McVeigh with the
getaway car.

NEW YORK — The man who's
accused of spreading the AIDS virus in
western New York was suppose to be
sentenced today on a drug charge, but
that's been postponed.

The reason is that he's been diag-
nosed with schizophrenia.

A judge in New York has ordered
Nushawn Wrlliarns to undergo a psychi-
atric evaluation. And he's rescheduled the
sentencing for next month.

.. Ofﬁcials think at least 10 people
have been infected with the AIDS virus
through direct contact with Williams or
with people he's had sex with.

Meanwhile, two New York state
lawmakers have drafted a bill that would
increase the criminal penalties against
anyone who knowingly exposes some-
onetotheAlDS virusandconcealstlrat
information.

SAYBROOK, Ill. —— A Halloween cos-
tume contest in Saybrook, l]l., sponsored
by the local Lion's Club, has people talk-
ing. One of the winners was an eighth-
grade girl who went dressed as a Ku Klux
Klan member.

Several people who were there said
the costume had KKK slogans printed on
it. Many parents said they still can't
believe that the three judges chose it as
the best in its division.

One of the judges said the panel was
going for originality. He also said
Halloween is supposed to be scary and
the K is scary.

Around the World

UNITED NATIONS — Iraq has
opened its door to some diplomats from
the United Nations. But each side has a
different view of what they'll be doing.

The United Nations says the team
will talk with the Iraqis about giving U.N.
inspectors full access to suspected
weapons sites.

But ‘the Iraqis say they'll be airing
their complaints about U.S. weapons
inspectors.

The United States is demanding that
Iraq comply with the United Nations and
allow weapons inspectors to do their
jobs.

Otherwise, the State Department
spokesman warns that the U.N. Security
Council is prepared to "take ﬁrm action."

On Wednesday, as the polls open,
students will vote for the new Student
Government Board members and presi-
dent. All 20 candidates, 16 running for
SGB and four running for president,
were given questionnaires on why they
are running, what they want to do with
the allocations process, and theircam-
paign goals. Here are the results of the 17
hopefuls who returned their question-
naires to The Pitt News.

"Access '98" slate, decided to run for
SGB because she's worked with SGB
committees for over a year, and is
involved with many on-campus activi-
ties. Some of the committees she worked
with were the community- and govem—
mental-relations committees. Kyzer says
she has a "unique outlook on problems
between student groups and SGB" as a
result of her campus and SGB affiliation.
Joseph Gielata, a Pitt junior on the
Gargoyle slate, decided to run for SGB
because "the board seems to have a
potential for signiﬁcant inﬂuence, yet
few students know or care about its exis-
tence." Gielata also wants to demonstrate
what "real representation could be."
Damon Hudac, a Pitt junior also on the
Gargoyle slate, decided to run for SGB
candidate Elizabeth
Wright suggested it to him.
"She said that instead of

"couldn't imagine not" running. McCabe
says she knew she was qualiﬁed for the
position and cares about what happens
with student government and the
University.

Steven Valsamidis, a Pitt junior, also
running under "A Better Campus" slate,
decided to run for student government
because he wasn't sure what direction he
wanted his life to go in. Because
Valsamidis was one of the former
Allocations Committee members this
semester, he decided to remain involved
in SGB because he "got sick to his stom-
ach" after the candidate registration
deadline passed, resulting in his yearning
to remain active in student government.
Valsamidis then succeeded in collecting
the required additional number of signa-
tures on his electoral petition, which
allowed him to run in this campaign.

Jennifer Karch, a Pitt sophomore on
the"Access '98" slate, which stands for
"Aid, Communication, Community,
Education, Services and Safety," decided
to run for SGB because she feels it is the
one place where she can truly make an
impact on the University.

"I really can make a difference in
SGB, and that is pretty amazing," says
Karch.

Ellen Kyzer, Pitt sophomore, also of the

slate, decided to

run for SGB because she loves the time
she spent in the SGB office and the
opportunities she had to make a diﬂer-
ence there. Meyers serves as the
Community Relations Committee co-
chair for student government. She also
worked on various Pitt-proud projects
such as the Bonﬁre, Pre-Game Bashes, a
biweekly SGB promotional table and the
promotion of Town Hall meetings.

"I am running because I sincerely
believe I can initiate more student
involvement throughout the University,"
said Meyers.

Adam Tekel, a Pitt sophomore, who is
also a member of the "Pride Has
Purpose" slate, decided to run for SGB
because he feels he acquired a strong
understanding of the organizational
structure of the University through his
participation in activities such as social
chairman for freshman government and
serving on the selections committee for
this year's Freshman Affairs Committee.
He is also affiliated with Pitt's Alpha
Epsilon Pi fraternity, which is one of his
campaign sponsors.

Elizabeth Klein, a Pitt junior and mem-
ber of the START ("Students, Transform,
Access, Responsibility, Together") slate,
decided to run for the SGB because she

 

believes this university has a commit-
ment to provide her with a quality edu-
cation.’ One of her commitments is to
better the student community at Pitt. ‘'1
know this is the position where I would
be most effective in reaching that goal

[student community]," says Klein.

David Teeters, a Pitt senior also on the
START slate, decided to run for SGB
president "to give students a choice."
Teeters plans to use the knowledge and
experience he acquired in his two years‘
experience in student government ——
including two boards, and the Elections
Committee in 1994 —— to serve the stu-
dents.

Geoff Broz, a Pitt sophomore, decided
to run for student government because
he knows "how to make it an efficient
and fair leadership."

Marc Wisnosky, a Pitt senior, decided
to run for student government because
he "spent the last two years criticizing
SGB as the editor of the Phoenix." Since
the recent allocations scandal, Wisnosky
"felt it was time to walk the walk" and do
what he can for Pitt students.

Ulysses "'Irey" Billips, a fourth-year
Pitt student, decided to run for SGB
president because he believes he has
"more to give to the students of the
University of Pittsburgh." Billips feels
he is the leader who can address issues
such as the lack of communication
between students and the board, and the
lack of a Pitt-proud identity.

George Mongell, a Pitt sophomore who
is involved in the SGB's Academic
Affairs‘ Committee, decided to run for
SGB because he wanted to make a dif-
ference in student government. Mongell

Elizabeth Wright, a Pitt junior, decided

to run for SGB because she has "grown '

to love this campusand SGB" over the
past year. Wright currently serves as the
external chair of the Academic Affairs
Committee.

Allocations

Michael Friedberg: Friedberg says that
to improve theallocations process, there
should be an allocations committee over
the summer so that more than one person
has power. This summer committee does
not have to be as large as the regular
Allocations Committee, according to
Friedberg. Overall, he thinks "the alloca-
tions process is a very good process,
with maybe one or two glitches."

Sharmon McCabe: McCabe has "faith
in Pitt's allocations process," but "unfor-
tunately, it's the people who disappoint
us." She agrees with Friedberg as far as
having a summer committee. Some of
McCabe's suggestions are to install three
or more board members and allocations
members during the summer to make
decisions.

Steven Valsamidis: As far as improving
the allocations process, Valsamidis feels
the process is very successful "as long as
responsible people are in the SGB and
allocations." i

"The process needs only minor
upgrades to accommodate progress."
Jennifer Karch: Karch suggests an
increase in the number of students over-
seeing the allocations process during the
summer. One idea is to have four student
officials stay in the area over the sum-
mer. If this

run for the allocations process is effec-
SGB president tive but that "the summer process

needs to be changed." She proposes hav-
ing a small committee during the sum-
mer to prevent all power resting with the
SGB president and allocations chair.

Joseph Gielata: Gielata proposes a sys-
tem of checks and balances for improv-
ing the allocations process. He suggests
that the Allocations Committee can
reject the board's allocating itself funds.
Allocations should first be able to reject
a proposal according to the "letter of the

Tuesday, 4 November 1997 F THE |1'1' NEWS 5

law,'' and second under the "spirit of the
law."

Damon Hudac: Hudac suggests the
Allocations Committee be given more
power so it can overrule the board. One
way that allocations could do this is by
overruling the board with a two—thirds
majority vote. Hudac also wants to
change the criteria for judging alloca-
tions requests. He wants the students to
depart from judging proposals only
according to the letter of the Allocations
Manual .and ask themselves,"Is this a
good use of the students‘ money?"

Kelly Meyers: Meyers would like the
Allocations Committee to remain at Pitt
over the summer to keep tabs on alloca-
tions business. Meyers also suggests "a

more stringent and thorough appoint- '

ment process for members as well as the
chair of the committee."

Adam Tekel: Tekel feels the current
allocations process is an effective sys-
tem, but believes that "more people
should be here over the summer to avoid
any chance of misuse [of funds]."
According to Tekel, communication
between board members and the
Allocations Committee is another com-
ponent for improving the allocations
process.

Elizabeth Klein: Klein wants to elimi-
nate the SGB's current power to allocate
itself money. One way she would do this
would be to subject any requests for
board funding to stringent budgetary
policies of the University.

David Teeters: Teeters feels the alloca-
tions process works well except for two
exceptions. First, he thinks there should
be a checks and balances system where-
by "any expenditure over $1,000 must be

‘approved by University administration

through set budgetary procedures."
Second, he would allocate money so it
will be "used more efficiently for student
needs." ‘
Geoff Broz: To
improve the alloca-
tions process,
Broz suggests
amending the
student gov-
ernment con-
stitution so
that the
SGB can
no longer

money. He says, "Put that job in the
hands of the Allocations Committee."
Also, Broz proposes a voucher sys-
tem under which "students choose where
the money in their student activities fee
will go."

Marc Wisnosky: Like Broz, Wisnosky
feels the best ways to improve the allo-
cations process is through a checks and
balances system whereby the SGB can-
not overrule the Allocations Committee.
He also supports the voucher system so
that students can choose which groups
get their money. . ’

Ulysses "'I‘rey" Billips: Billips wants to

  
 
   

CAMPAIGN

"have more hard-working individuals
who are dedicated to "fairly allocating
funds to students," and have the SGB
business manager attend Allocations
Committee meetings. Billips feels the
biggest ﬂaw of the allocations process is
that "it does not efﬁciently and effective-
ly serve the student body,"

George Mongell: Mongell has three
major suggestions for improving the
allocations process: have a certified
University ofﬁcial closely monitor the
Allocations Committee, have monthly
evaluations of the Allocations
Committee, and constantly check
receipts to ensure proper distribution of
allocations money.

Alyson Wallach: Wallach's suggestions
for improving the allocations process
include increasing accountability and
communication, increasing accessibility
to the SGB, opening up the committee
members‘ selection process so students
can voice their opinions, and allowing
the SGB president and SGB business
manager to sit in on Allocations
Committee hearings and meetings,
which are traditionally closed.
Elizabeth Wright: Wright says her sug-
gestions for improving the allocations
process are "communication and knowl-
edge."

"By giving the students knowledge
about the allocations process, communi-
cation can be achieved," she notes.

Campaign Goals

Michael Friedberg: The
main goals of Friedberg's
"A Better Campus" carn-

paign are to improve stu-
dent life after hours on
campus. Some speciﬁcs are
to build a video store in the
Towers Lobby, have a 24-hour
food shop and improve the off-
carnpus shuttle service.
Shannon McCabe: Two words
describe McCabe's campaign:
"communication" and "pride." She
plans to work with‘ Pitt's administration
and city ofﬁcials to "strengthen our
[Pitt's] internship program" and install a
"Pitt Panther statue on lower campus to
increase Pitt identiﬁcation."

Steven Valsamidis: The main goals of
Valsamidis' "A Better Campus" cam-
paign are to increase student involve-
ment in University life and to improve
the quality of residence life. One way he
plans to do the latter is by creating a
campus laundry service.

Jennifer Karch: The main goals of
Karch's campaign include: informing the
student body about ﬁnancial aid, increas-
ing communication between the SGB

 

and students, reinstating the President's
Council, placing a voting student on the
Board of Trustees and making students
more aware and informed of campus
safety issues through accurate crime
reporting.

Ellen Kyzer: Kyzer
says, "The main goal
of my campaign is to
make sure the issues
students care about
are dealt with."

Joseph
G i e l a t a :
Gielata's cam-
paign goals
include inform-
ing as many stu-
dents as possible
about what he
would do if elect-
ed. He would like
to have more than
"student leaders
and governmental
elite" know what's
going on in student
government.

Damon Hudac: The main goal \
of Hudac's campaign is to
"achieve a landslide victory
while remaining honest." He also wants
to campaign in his own way and not how
one is "supposed to campaign" by utiliz-
ing campaign tactics such as making
speeches to students on the shuttles and
in front of the Cathedral of Learning
between classes.

Kelly Meyers: Concerning her main
campaign goals, Meyers says, "The main
goal of my ‘campaign’ is to win."

Adam Tekel: Tekel's main goals are to
organize a biweekly meeting of all stu-
dent group leaders and address over-
crowding in the dorms. The biweekly
meetings would "give all different lead-
ers a chance to report on what their
group is doing." To alleviate dorm over-
crowding, Tekel wants to "push for Pitt-
owned Oakland apartments to be reno-
vated so more students could move into
University—owned apartments." Also,

Tekel wants to open a safe, late-night A’

eatery and study lounge, where students
"can use their meal plans and study after
11:00 p.m. without walking around
Oakland."

Elizabeth Klein: The main goals of
Klein's campaign come from the
acronym START. Klein wants to work
for the students, concentrating on their
needs and organizations. Klein and her
slate want to transform the SGB and
make it more of an "open door organiza-
tion that promotes participation." Klein
plans on utilizing The Pitt News to
advertise meetings and publish minutes

 
  

of the meetings. Through the meeting
minutes, and by actively encouraging
student feedback, Klein's slate will pro-
mote access. Through representation on
the SGB, her slate will return responsi-
bility by "working to ﬁnish worthwhile
projects, such as Town Hall meetings
and course-evaluation guides." "Finally
we will work together," says Klein.

"Not only with those on the elected
board, but with the whole student body."

David Teeters: Just as Klein does,
Teeters would implement the goals of the

START acronym.

"Fundamentally, our goal is to
use. SGB to serve students‘
interests."

Geoff Broz: Broz's

campaign goals focus
heavily on alloca-
tions reform
through "the

A 1 l o c a t i o n s

Committee hav-

ing ﬁnal say on

how much SGB is
, given," and the
. distribution of
ﬁmds through the

voucher system.

Students wants
and needs are also
a part of his carn-
paign, during
which he wants to

"aggressively ﬁnd
out what students

want to happen
here at Pitt."

Marc Wisnosky:

Wisnosky's goals include
having the SGB more effectively reach
the students, taking the ﬁnal say about
allocations away from the SGB and cre-
ating a voucher system.

Ulysses "Trey" Billips: "The main goal
of my campaign is to win, so I can go
about the "business of serving the stu-
dents."

Communication with the student
body and teamwork are two other
aspects of his campaign. He believes that
these points will help make- effective
changes in student government.

George Mongell: Mongell's campaign
goals include improving the school's
academics, such as publishing teacher
and course evaluations online and regis-
tering for courses online or by telephone.
He also wants to open lines of communi-
cation between students and the SGB
through a monthly newsletter that the
SGB would send to all organizations.
The newsletter would inform them of
current SGB business. In referring to
communication, Mongell says that he
wants "to serve as a student ambas-
sador."

Alyson Wallach: "The main goal of my
campaign is to get at least one more vote
than the other candidates," says Wallach.

Elizabeth Wright: Wright's campaign
goals include "communication between
SGB and students, academic issues and
continuation of a Pitt-pride community."

was a big guy," Kramer said.

Phi Kappa Theta pledge Kyle
Arango was also punched and suffered a
broken nose. _

Both victims were taken to the hos-
pital for treatment and have been
released.

Kramer said the ﬁght started when
uninvited guests began trying to get into
the party. Kramer said McMullen was
among the uninvited guests.

''I wasn't there for the initial part, but
there was a skirmish. We have a strict
guest list as part of our policy, and they
weren't on the list," Kramer said.

He said there was a lot of pushing,
and that a couple of fraternity brothers
moved everyone outside.

Corey Lutsky, a witness to the inci-
dent, positively identiﬁed Kirk
McMullen to Pitt Police and will attend a
preliminary hearing Wednesday.

Lutsky said he did not want to com-
ment until after the hearing.

Kramer said he chased McMullen
down to the Pi Kappa Phi house but that
McMullen ran into the fratemity, where
his brother Brad is a member. Kirk
McMullen is not a Pi Kappa Phi mem-
ber. .

According to Kramer, the Pitt Police

rounded the house because Kirk

McMullen wouldn't come out.

"They caught him trying to crawl out
a back window," Kramer said. "I
watched him get arrested and saw him
get handcuffed."

One Pi Kappa Phi member, who

asked to remain anonymous, said the fra— .

ternity was not harboring McMullen.

He said that McMullen was seen
bleeding from a face injury outside the Pi
Kappa Phi fraternity house when some-
one let him in to "wash up."

According to the witness, the police
went inside the fraternity and escorted
McMullen outside without incident.

DEBATE

Wallach to prove her qualiﬁcations.

He asked, “Throughout your cam-
paign, you have been claiming experi-
ence as a student leader. What have you
done to prove your day-to-day comn1it—
ment to the student body?”

Wallach responded by listing her
leadership qualities and achievements.

“I am proving my day-to-day com-
mitrnent. I am willing to volunteer my
entire seni

Shannon McCabe questioned
Teeters about his role in addressing the

FROM PAGE 1 *

‘ allocations scandal as a member of the

current board. .

“What are your feelings about the
recent ' findings that support the
Allocations Com1nittee’s allegations?
Why did it take so long to get an investi-
gation, and if you knew, why didn’t you
personally initiate an investigation soon-
er?” asked McCabe.

Teeters responded by saying, "I
believe [Interim Vice Chancellor for
Student Affairs] Dr. Gallagher summed
it up last week when he said it broke his
heart. When I became aware of the inap-
propriate issues in allocations, I spoke to
President Da1Molin and the SGB advis-

er. We tried to address the problem inter— A

nally first.” Teeters declined to comment
on his awareness of the new problems
due to the fact that legal procedures are
currently under way.

Billips‘ question to Wallach
addressed a very different issue, that of
women’s issues on campus.

“How do you stand on issues affect-
ing women at the University of
Pittsburgh?”

Wallach exclaimed in her reply, “I’ll
be damned if another girl gets raped on
this campus and we could have prevent-
ed it with education.”

At the conclusion of the question-
and-answer period, each candidate reit-
erated his main goal or qualiﬁcation.

McCabe was the first to give her
remarks. She stressed the importance of
the SGB's working as a team.

“The board needs to ﬁnd a common
goal and work toward it,” she said.

Teeters used his three minutes to dis-
cuss his most important qualiﬁcations.

“What makes me different is that I
a1n here out of love. The fact that my
actions have been attacked previously is
beside the point. I always had the stu-
dents‘ interest at heart,” said Teeters.

Ulysses "Trey" Billips stressed the
importance of the SGB presidency, com-
paring it to the role of a quarterback.

“As president, you should have a
person to make sure your team can win.
As quarterback, I am willing to hand off
the ball to other committees to help the
team.”

Wallach made the ﬁnal closing argu-
ment.

“I’m here running because I care.
My love for Pitt and its students is
unchallenged and unchanging.”

and if you're not careful, the whole
meaning of the sentence‘ can be miscon-
strued," said Bradley—Steck.

She also looks for "a real healthy
dose of curiosity," a good attitude and
good basic writing skills.

"I like people who can compel you
with their stories," noted Bradley—Steck.

Gaither, ‘ who used to work in the
newspaper business and now works in
public relations, will tell students why

. they need a broad—based education and

must be willing to start small and work
their way up.

"More than anything, it's being real-
istic," said Gaither.

He will also emphasize the differ-
ence between public relations and other
writing ﬁelds, because he is experienced
in both.

"He's done a little bit of everything,"
said Sims. '

Gaither said the writing he does in
public relations relies on critical thinking
to allow him to decide which form of
media to use to get points across effec-
tively.

"It allows you to be a bit more cre-
ative than you are able to be in journal-
ism," said Gaither. "In public relations,
you have all the mediums at your dis-
posal." .

Harrison is also experienced in two
areas of writing. He is a novelist in addi-
tion to being the deputy editor of
Harper's Magazine.

Although Harrison, like many of the
panelists, has not prepared what he will
say to the students, he believes that most
young writers encounter the barrier of
preparation.

"A lot of people want to be writers,
and often there's no one there to tell you
how to do it," said Harrison.

KDKA-TV sports anchor Pompeani
will stress the need for internships and
other experience because of the scarce
opportunities available in media ﬁelds.

"If you elect to get into TV news, the
internship is more valuable than any

theory is only as good as the application
of it."

Sims invited Pompeani because of
his popularity and because Career Day

SGB candidates need
to be more specific

For the ﬁrst time in recent memory, there are serious
issues to be addressed this year by student government can-
didates. '

Reforming allocations‘, improving communications
and increasing campus unity are all cited repeatedly by
almost every candidate. It’s no wonder why. This past year
has left the student body feeling that tl1ey’ve been betrayed
by some of their student leaders. Many students wonder
what student government actually does for them. Every

candidate is aware of these problems, and they cite them

time and time again.

But that’s about all most do in their speeches —— cite the
problems. Few offer speciﬁc suggestions about how to
solve them. Few tell us what they will actually do for our
student community. ‘

Saying you’ll_ improve communication by printing a
list of SGB projects isn’t actually addressing the issue. That
doesn’t explain to students why SGB projects should be
important to them, what they can do to address their con-
cerns, whether SGB even cares for student input or how
they will obtain signiﬁcant student input.

Candidates see the student population as not knowing
what SGB has been doing for it. That has probably led can-
didates to think that publicizing SGB activity equals com-
munication. It does not.

Candidates are making promises, but with few excep-
tions, most haven’t indicated that they have a feasible strat-
egy for implementing their ideals. Students have to demand
further action from these candidates.

Students: Go to the Towers lobby this afternoon and
demand that candidates give you ﬁrm answers to these
questions and any others you feel are important. Don’t let
them get off by spewing some idealistic rhetoric. Make
them tell you what they have planned. Make them tell you
what they have actually researched and thought through.
Tell them that you want your student-activities fee to be
used prudently and for the beneﬁt of the student body, and
make them tell you how they’ll ensure that happens.

Make them tell you what they are actually going to do
and how they are actually going to do it.

Everybody can be annoying

Alison Novicki

Columnlst

Per the request of several Pitt
News readers, I have put together
another list of “armoying things
that people do!”

Before I move on in full
swing, I- would like to thank
everybody who e-mailed me with
their own lists of annoying
things. The response was tremen-
dous! However, I regret that I do
not have the space to include
everything that was sent to me. In
fact, based on the amount of
responses, I could probably write
a two-month series about armoy-
ing things that people do.

So, join me as I dabble in the
daily pet peeves of all the people
who wrote to me. My comrades!

Rejoice and take pleasure in
knowing that everybody can be
armoying  even you!

°To people who ﬁnd it necessary
to take their cellular phones and
beepers to class and don ’t bother
to either turn them off or switch
them to a silent mode: Do you
have any idea how insulting that
is to a professor? If you are beep-
ing or ringing in class, you are
immediately letting the professor
know that her class is not impor-
tant. For all the people sitting
around you when you beep or
ring, we don’t think you’re cool
because you have the money to
spend on such a convenience
every month; we think you are
rude and disruptive. If you are
expecting someone to get in
touch with you about something
so important that it carmot wait
until after class is over, then per-

haps you shouldn’t go. If you do

decide to take a beeper or cell
phone to class, at least use a silent
mode. , .

°To people who obsess about
being the ﬁrst person on a PAT
bus: It’s not the last seat out of
Saigon! (Thanks for the great
line, Greg!) There is something
called “waiting for your turn”
that most of us learn in early
childhood; but apparently, there
are several people around
Oakland who never learned about
this. They’re the ones who will
slip in to the seven-inch space
between the street and the person
who is already standing there as
the bus is approaching. They’re
the ones who will ignore the 35
people standing in line and push
their way through. Do they really
think that every other person
doesn’t need be somewhere, too?

Let’s teach these people a
lesson. The next time you see
someone do this, tell them, with a
straight face: “Oh! They must be
giving out prizes to the ﬁrst per-
son on the bus because you’re
certainly anxious to win!”

°To groups of people who walk
abreast on sidewalks or in hall-
ways and expect everyone else to
move out of their way: Is it really
that hard to take half a step
behind your group to let someone
pass? Hm, if my options are
walking into you, hitting a wall or
stepping into trafﬁc, I will opt for
the least dangerous. (I eliminated
the option of standing ﬂat against
a wall until you all pass me
because I’d rather not have my
feet stepped on.)

A related occurrence is when
those people are walking abreast
at a very slow pace in front of
you, and they act tenibly both-

THE PITT NEWS

ered when you say “excuse me”

to get through. _
(Gee, I’d love to have a get-

together for the obsessive people

_ who must be the ﬁrst to enter a

PAT bus and the people who
block the sidewalks because
they’re so slow.)
-To people who spend the last
ﬁve minutes of every class pack-
ing their bags: Do you not under-
stand that other students actually
care about the material given in
the last ﬁve minutes of class?
Yep, that extra 40 seconds you
might have gained by packing
your things early will really count
in the long run. It is quite dis-
tracting to listen to the 
and shuffling of papers, books
and bags while attempting to hear
what your professor is saying. -
If you really need to leave the
class early, pack up your stuﬂ’ in
the hall or outside, and just leave.
Have some respect for your pro-
fessor and other students.

0 To people who criticize colum-
nists for supposedly being “over-
ly opinionate ”: Um, this is our
job. If we all became un-opinion-
ated and neutral, this section of
the paper‘ would be called “facts”
or “news,” not “opinions.”
Besides, this isn’t just some
University rag! They don’t hire
any schmuck off the street who
wants to write -— you have to
work. This is a college newspa-
per that is just as professional and
respectful as “regular” newspa-
pers. And accordingly, we have
the same quirks.

Alison Novicki wants everybody
to understand that this list is
meant for adult entertainment
purposes only.

THE PITT NEWS

 

QUESTION AND ANSWER WITH KEVIN MCCLATCHY

Vote yes on the Regional Renaissance Initiative

The Pitt News: Why should someone vote
for the Regional Renaissance Initiative?

I would tell someone to vote for this if
they felt there was a need for change in this
region, which I think there is. For the last 20
years we’ve been losing jobs and population,
and we have a declining tax base. We rank
dead last in attracting companies to a major
metropolitan area. We as a county have the
second—oldest population in the country
behind Florida’s Dade County. We are not
doing anything proactive to encourage busi-
ness to come to this area. We can’t sit back
and continue to watch people and business-
es move out of this area without doing some-
thing about it

TPN: Who supports the Initiative?

We have a very broad-based group
behindus,ﬁomtlrelaborunions, totheedu-
cation and minority communities, to the cul-
tural community. Politicians such as Mayor
Tom Murphy, U.S. Senator Rick Santorurn,
County Commissioner Bob Cranmer and
the rrrajority of Pittsburgh City Council
members also support the Initiative. We have
alotofpeopleinmanydiﬂ°erentareaswho
are supporters of this measure. I think they
arethepeoplewhoreallyunderstandbusi-
nessandwhatneedstohappeninthisregion.

TPN:Whatdoyouthinkofthosewho
opposethkmmure?

Larry Dunn, in his short time as majori-

ty leader of the county com- 
missioners, lowered taxes,
which he said would solve all
our problems. And in the
meantime, he took a county
with a budget surplus and in a
short time brought it to a

 

. and Duquesne did an eco-
nornic-irnpact study that
i said that this could mean
= 30,000 new jobs for the

 Those are very creditable
 institutions, and I think we

rating to be downgraded, and E ing in this area, you know
he was deposed as chairman  there is alack of young peo-
of the county commissioners, -- ‘ : ple here, and you know
so that’s the sort of leadership there is a lack of things for

   

on the other side of the issue.

The real problem with
the opponents of this mea-
sure is that they have no solu-
tions. What they bring to the table is a cyni-
cal attitude toward this region and our abili-

tytobesuccessfulandmoveforwarvdinthe,

future. We’re bringing a solution to the table,
and the opponents are bringing nothing.

people our age to do. Most
important of all, there is a
lack of jobs for people ﬁn-
ishing college or thinking of
working in this area. A lot of people would
like to stay in Pittsburgh if they could.
Unfortunately, there are not a lot ofjobs in
this area right now. We’ve got to do more to
attract companies here, sowecana1lowpeo-
ple stay in this area.

You don’t have to be a baseball fan,
football fan or a fan of a convention center,
but you have to be a fan of Western
Pennsylvania and want to see it succeed.

TPN: What ifthe Initiative doesn’t pass?

Thereisnoplan B. Pvebeenworking

ferentdirectionlthinkalotoftheirideasare
far-fetched at best. T‘hey’ve talked about a
sportslot1ery,butIthinkthefactthatthe

Pennsylvania lottery proceeds go to senior
citizens would make it very hard to tap into.
One group tried to tap into it to get some
money for education, and that was turned
down. So, if they wouldn’t let the money go
to education, how are they going to let it go
to sports facilities?

We’ve looked and studied all these other
options, and tl1at’s why we came up with
what we have: because it is the best option.
On Tuesday, people have a chance to vote

' for a real solution. My real concern is that if

it is defeated, the leadership of the opposition
will feel like it won something, and the ﬁrst
thing they will do is nothing.

TPN: Isthkjustastadiumtax?

The New York Times wrote an article
about Pittsburgh and western Pemrsylvania
being at a crossroads. They basically said

Tax creates a
new level of
government

I would like to address some of the
issues raised in Alison Novicki’s editorial
on the stadium-tax issue. One of the issues
of the stadium tax that deeply concerns me
is the fact that this tax was initiated, and
would be collected and administrated, by a
group of people who were not elected by
me, the taxpayer. This administration will
be an additional layer of regional govem-
ment, in addition to the existing city, coun-
ty and state governments, and it does not
expire in seven years when the tax is sup-
posed to. The idea of installing another
level of government with the power to tax,
and which has no checks and balances and
no expiration date, is what I am truly
against, not the $40.00 per year that the tax
would cost me. '

My opposition to the tax has been
enhanced by the recent success of
Columbus, Ohio, in funding their new
hockey arena. In May, the voters of

ber, and university affiliation (if any).

Franklin County defeated a sales-tax ini-
tiative similar to our upcoming initiative.
Two weeks after the election, Nationwide
Insurance and the Columbus Dispatch
newspaper armounced that they would
fund the entire arena. Another private
company is funding Columbus’ new soc-
cer arena, and the Ohio State Buckeyes’
new arena is also a privately funded arena.
Columbus is one of the “cities that
were small towns 50 years ago” that is
whipping Pittsburgh’s tail. Maybe that is
because the voters have the guts to stand
up to additional taxes and government,
thereby forcing the city to look for new
ways to improve the region. Maybe it’s
time we made our government get cre-

ative.

Initiative means
more jobs for
young people

As a life—long Pittsburgher and
young person, I often hear from my
peers complaints about how much
they really like Pittsburgh but that
there are no job opportunities. This
Election Day we have a chance to
keep our young people in
Pittsburgh, by voting yes on the
Regional Renaissance initiative. We
have some of the best colleges and
universities, which draw young
people from all over the world to
our region, only to have them

regretfully leave our region after
they graduate in search of a good
job.

Western Pennsylvania must stop
the class struggle between the sub-
urbs and the city. If we do not hang
together as a region, we will surely
hang separately as municipalities.
While opponents call this an
oppressive tax to fund stadiums and
millionaire ballplayers, they are
signing the death warrant for the
vitality of our region. The regional
renaissance tax will create the seed
money necessary to clean up land
sites and build new neighborhoods
and put money back into our
deplorable infrastructure.

I am challenging young people
to get out and vote.

This money is imperative to the
survival of our region. If you vote
no to this initiative, you are saying
no to taking responsibility, and vet-
ing yes to the alternatives and pipe
dreams like riverboat gambling.

Only a few
pennies to save
our Pirates

Election Day.

Just the thought of Election Day
strikes fear into the hearts of  oh,
wait, nobody cares about Election Day.

Especially sports fans. Election
Day comes just after the World Series
ends, just before college and pro foot-
ball get interesting, and just before
anybody remembers that, yes, the NBA
and the NHL do have a regular season.

Sports fans are in hibernation dur-
ing the week, in most cases rising early
Sunday morning to the dulcet tones of
Myron Cope and returning to the cave
Monday evening after getting sick and
tired of Dan Dierdorf.

Tuesday just doesn’t figure in.

Well, now it does. We all have to
rise from our football—induced stupor,
toss off our buffalo wing remnants and
go vote.

Fans across the region get a chance
to let Pittsburgh sports fever get the
better of them today, as the Regional
Renaissance Initiative (or, the artist
formerly known as “Stadium Tax”)
comes up for review.

Congressmen, senators, ﬁscal ana-
lysts, public-relations hacks and the
like have ﬁlled the airwaves (and lit-
tered the streets) with enough propa-
ganda to make a Panther Fanfest orga-
nizer physically ill.

Everybody has a sound, logical
reason to vote “aye” or “nay” on this
bit of legislation. Officials from around
the area are throwing innocent
bystanders into the streets so that they
don’t block television cameras.
Steelers and Pirates officials have said
“We have a plan” so often, it’s begin-
ning to sound like they’re organizing
an escape attempt.

Area residents can latch on to any
piece of rhetoric they wish, and make it
their own rationale to vote in whatever
direction they choose.

I’ll save you the energy and the
rhetoric. Bottom line: If this measure
doesn’t pass in at least Allegheny
County, then there’s "a chance that the
Pirates will move.

Simple.

Sure the Pirates should build their
own stadium. Sure the Steelers should
pay to have Three Rivers renovated to
their liking. Sure tax dollars should
keep going to feed the hungry or pro-
tect the innocent or pay Don Walko’s

Volleyball comes home, scores two wins

Matt Grove

Staff Writer

Home sweet home.

That was the greeting
at the Fitzgerald Field
House this weekend for
the Pitt women’s volley-
ball team, as it hosted a
match for the first time in
nearly a month.

The Lady Panthers
kept their postseason
hopes alive with a pair of
Big East Conference wins
over Providence and
Boston College, raising
their record to 13-9, 5-2
in the conference.

The Lady Friars, who
entered the game at 19-
10, invaded the friendly
of Fitzgerald
Saturday and were handed
a loss, 5-15, 15-8, 15-13
and 15-12.

Two Pittsburgh play-
ers notched double-dou-
bles in the win. Freshman
Marcia Thiesen recorded
15 kills and 11 digs.
Jessica Van Der Mallie
totaled 13 kills and a
team-high 14 digs.

Tara Haefner (#13, setting a teammate) led the Panthers
in assists in both conference contests this past weekend.

Stacy Renick notched
13 assists and Peggy
Meinhart added 11. Tara
Haefner‘ kept up her con-
sistent setting with a
match—high 41 assists, as
well as 12 digs.

Providence also had
two players reach double-
doubles in the match.
Sherryl Jones tallied 14
kills and 13 digs, while
Heidi Brady chipped in
with 12 kills and 12 digs.

Colleen Lee and
Kristen Ham combined
for 45 assists and 19 digs
in the loss.

Sunday marked the
first University of
Pittsburgh Athletics
Department Spirit Contest
of the year. The crowd of
over 200 cheered on
Pittsburgh as the Panthers
upended visiting Boston
College in straight sets,
15-13, 15-6 and 15-5.

Pittsburgh registered
49 kills and 10 aces in the
match. Boston College
notched 22 kills to
Pittsburgh’s 17 in the first
game, but couldn’t man-
age the win.

Pittsburgh outplayed
the Lady Eagles in the
final two games. In the
final game, the Lady
Panthers scored eight
unanswered points en
route to the 10-point win.
Junior Kelly Meyers led
the charge with three
straight aces during the
run.

Season-ending split for women’s soccer squad

Matt Mento

staff Writer

The Pittsburgh Lady Panther
soccer squad wrapped up its season
weekend with a win on
Halloween night and a loss the fol-
lowing Sunday. The Panthers took
the Georgetown Hoyas into double
overtime and came out with a 1-0
victory on Friday the 31st, but on

The Hoyas entered the contest on
Halloween night looking for a treat
from the suspect Panther defense,
but instead received a trick -— a
rough battle that would feature 39
fouls combined from the two squads

in their first-ever meeting.

In the first half, Hoya freshman
midfielder Liz Delgado blew a gold-
en opportunity for her team when she
missed an open left side of the net
and hit the far post. Delgado would

Do you know the differ-
ence between a burrito and an
enchilada, or between potage
and bouillon, or an egg roll and
a spring roll? Sometimes it can
be difficult to order from a
menu featuring foods from
another land. Even if you have
visited the restaurant many
times, you may still be unaware
of some of the items. Below is a
glossary of terms to help you
understand what certain foods
are.

As a service to our readers,
here is a brief guide to
wine choice, offered by Phil
Domski, an eight-year fac-
ulty instructor in wines and

mixology at the

Pennsylvania Institute of
Culinary Arts.

Domski said the first
considerations when choos-
ing wine for a meal is the
cooking method for the
entree.

“Some cooking tech-
niques, like broiling or bak-
ing, producela lighter
effect,” Domski said. “By
contrast, grilled or fried
will have a heavier effect.”
In the same way, wine can
be light or heavy.

White wines can either
be dry or sweet, and within
each of these orders are
light, medium and heavy
wines.

Red wines are similarly
categorized.

Domski saidltextures
and sauces of foods are just
as important in choosing
the most palatable vintage.

“Lighter and white
sauces will take a lighter-
bodied white wine,” he
said. “Red sauces should be
accompanied by heavier
and more ful1—bodied
wine.”

Choosing wine mirrors
life: finding a balance is the
key to contentment.
“Balance is a key word,” he
said. Diners should strive
to match the weight of the
wine to the weight of the
meal.

For a variety of meals,
Domski suggested the fol-
lowing wines:

“Red

burgundy or a California

Porterhouse steak:

Cabernet Sauvignon.”
Grilled salmon: “White
burgundy or a California
Chardonnay.”
Cajun or jerk chicken:
“The more you increase the

pepper or the spice, the
more difficult it becomes to
find a good choice of wine.
The more you turn up the
heat, so to speak, the more
the food can overpower the
subtlety of the wine.”

Red pasta sauces:
“Chianti or Zinfandel will
cover 95 percent of red
saucesf’

White pasta sauces:
“For something like
Fettucini Alfredo a dry,
crisp white wine, (such as)
French Chablis or Orvieto
(an Itali_an wine).”

For dessert wines,
Domski said, “As a rule,
drier wines work better
than sweeter wines.”

He said dishes with
fruit, like an apple tart, or
cheesecake are desserts in
which wine is recommend-
ed.

ofthi.s respecglambothqualiﬁedandczrpable forthe
position. I have worked with the last four presidents
of Student Government. I have served on the last two
Boards-—witnessing what works and what does not
work with Student Government. I have been a
proven voice on university policy, on behalf of stu-

issues and residence space (or the lack thereof), dis-
cussing use of new technology and university class-
room space, working with the implementation of the
new PittCard, ﬁghting for student—run course evalua-
tion guides, and seriously regarding the responsibility
of effectively allocating the Student Activities Fee. I
have the experience, perspective, and abilities neces-
sary to coordinate the efforts of the Board to better — - A» 
serve the students’ interests. Additi nally, I have demonstrated my dedication to the University of Pittsburgh
and my willingness to work tirelessly for the betterment of the university community in many ways: as a
Freshman Peer Counselor, a Resident Assistant, :1 member and officer of the Blue and Gold Society, a
P.E.E.R. Educator for Sexual Assault Services and a tower on University of  Crew. I am Proudly
Pitt and Prepared to Prove it‘  to Pin!

Reasons forrunntng: It is still an exciting time to be here at the University of Pittsburgh! The University

here more enjoyable and memorable-—to help make this a Pitt Proud Community.

tributing funds to support student organizations. Aurdernic issues, such as new General Education
Requirements, need to be decided with student input. we need to continue ﬁghting for a student-run
course evaluation guide. Quality of life issues must also be addressed-—the university needs to commit
resources towards the construction of a new residence hall. The freshman experience needs to be consol-
idated into a uniﬁed effort. Cooperation with student groups will be continued, and working together, we
can establish the tradition of class picnics. as your new President, these and other issues will be tackled.

 

Shannon A. Mecabe
Year; Major:

Senior, Political Science and Communication
Qualiﬁcations:

I was a member of the Allocations Committee
that resigned this Fall. Therefore, I am quite
familiar with the policies and rules that are
supposed to govern the actions of the SGB. I
was an active member of GRC in the second
semester of my freshman year. This exernpli-
ﬁes my interest and desire to be active in the
Pitt community. I sat on the sidelines of last
years election as a campaign manager. This
year I have decided to try my hand at the lead-
ing role. I have since displayed dedication
and leadership though my involvement as the
President of the Undergraduate
Communications Club. v  ._ V
Reasons for runniﬂg-' As I mentioned ' "  ” ’5 7‘ ‘ " '

above, I have been an active member within Student Government for the past four years of
my college career. I know what that ofﬁce is capable of achieving. I would like to see Pitt
achieve “A Better Campus” community. I plan to advocate communication, a stronger sense
of identification and the pride that will result in a stronger university system.

Goals §felea‘ed° 1) Communication: I would like to see better communication to the stu-
dents and faculty outside and within the office. This way problems may be resolved through
proper use of those lines of communication. 2) Security in the Future: I would like to
strengthen our internship and job plaoernent centers. Pitt is supposed to be a stepping stone
totheﬁrtureforthestudentbuttheydontseemtolookpasttheCathedralwalls. Thereisan
entire business community downtown starved for interns. It’s a ‘Win-win” relationship. 3)
Something CONCRETE: In order to promote Pitt pride I would like to see some funding put
toward the installation of a Pit Panther statue on the lower campus. Ideally, I would like to
station it in front of the Union or above the bridge/walkway that connects the Towers to
Forbes Quad, just above Forbes Ave.

Reasons for running: I would like to see

Year, Major: Sophomore, History and

Qualifications: I am a student at the
University of Pittsburgh who is interested in
betterment of campus life.

Reasons for running: Through my involve-
ment in University activities and organiza-
tions, I have seen the difficulties and limita-
tions placed on students. I would like to see
student government have more of a role in
University issues and the SGB be more repre-
sentative and responsible to the students’
needs and concerns.
Goals if elected: To be responsible and rep-
resent the students’ needs by insuring that the
University departments are adequately han-
dling students’ needs in regards to student life after hours.

Year,» Major: Junior, Chemistry
Q'ual1_'f2'cations: An excess of common
sense, motivation, andthe backbone to stand
accountable for my decisions.

Reasons for running: The people there are
not communicating very well with the student
body and are doing a poor job of addressing
student’s concerns. I am running to show
them how it’s done.

Goals if elected: 1. Reform the SGB-
Allocations committee relationship to elimi-
nate a conﬂict of interest. 2. Actively use any
means at my disposal to communicate to stu-
dents what SGB is doing, why, and what SGB
plans to do in the future. 3. Install gargoyles
on the Cathedral of Learning.

Year, Major: Junior, Political Science and Urban
Studies ‘ _
Qualiﬁcations: A Student Government Board
member accepts a serious and signiﬁcant responsi-
bility to the students of this University. He or she
must realize that this obligation resides in serving
the student body, and must make a commitment to
actively involve students in student government.
Since I have arrived at Pitt, I have aimed to involve
students in campus activities. As a Freshman Peer
Counselor, I had the please of introducing the entire
freshman class to the opportunities and resources
available to them. As an active member of my
sorority, I was chosen to implement the new mem-
ber program for two consecutive new member
classes. I have balanced these commitments with
volunteer work for Big Brothers and Big Sisters, all
while maintaining a high grade point average.
Reasons for running Right now, there are significant opportunities for the improvement
and advancement of the Student Government Board. Pitt students deserve the best from
student government, and I am determined to build a board that is effective, accessible and
representative. Most importantly, I owe allegiance to only the students of this university. As
an ordinary student, I am ready to shoulder the immense responsibility of working for the
entire student community. This university is an exceptional institution and the student body
needs a government that is receptive to their concerns and ideas, as well as a board that
takes the initiative to see these concerns addressed.

Goals if elected‘ First, I am committed to work with the board to increase the account-
ability of SGB to the students of this university. We will begin with reporting all SGB meet-
ing and events to the student body. Most importantly, we will consider the current alloca-
tions process and implement any needed changes. Personally, I am determined to work on
the following: 1) improve SGB relations with the Pitt Program Council in order to enhance
student programming, 2) ensure that a relevant course evaluation guide is available to all
students, 3) pressure the University to commit resources to a new residence hall, along with
improving the condition of existing ones, such as extending the Towers’ pitifully small laun-
dry facility, 4) make certain that Food Services continues to hear student input concerning
food quality, the BLOCK plan and customer service within dining facilities, 5) once again,
to actively solicit and implement suggestions in order to reform the current allocations
process. I am Proudly Pitt and Prepared to Prove It!

Qualiﬁcations: My qualifications for Student
Govemment Board include a Community Relations
Committee member for the 96-97 year, Phi Sigma Pi ini-

96-97 and 97-98, C’ cle K (volunteer organization) offi-
cer 97-98, RSA 2“ year officer (Tower A 96-97, Quad
97-98). Also, I have been lobbying for more money in
Pell and Phea grants for students, working on organiz-
ing programs to make ﬁnancial aid infomration accessi-
ble to“ all students at this University, and planning the
hand in hand fesitival for 97-98.

Reasons for running: I have decided to run for
Student Government Boardbecause I have spent the
last year and a half in the Student Government Board
office working to implement programs to beneﬁt the
student body such as petitioning for the house and sen-
ate to give more money in funding for the Phea and Pell
grants. I am also involved in many other student groups
which helps me understand the frustration and disappointment students have found with the
Student Govemment Board. I feel by combining these two roles, I have a unique outlook on the
situation, and therefore, I know if elected I will be able to make adiustments with the SGB to
improve this relationship. The SGB should be an organization that helps students attain a pow-
erful role at this University. I want to play a significant role by giving the students back their power.
Goals 1feIected° My goals once elected include the following: to implement programs to make
financial aid more attainable for students, to better communication between campus groups and
organizations and SGB, to revamp the allowtions /student checks and balances for the student
body, to increase community awareness of the positive and important activities on this campus,
to increase the amount of community service projects that take a campus wide initiative and to
add more services to improve safety on campus.

Year, Major: Sophomore, Pre-Iaw (Communications
and Political Science)

Qualiﬁcations: I feel I am a qualified candidate for
an SGB board position for the following reasons.
Currently I am involved in the SGB’s Academic Affairs
committee, the PPC’s Lecture Committee, I’m involved
in RSA, he CAS Council and I served as Pitt Basketball
Manager my Freshman year. These organizations have
further developed and enhanced my decision making
skills, my communication skills, my leadership abili-
ties, my leadership abilities, my ability to accept
responsibility and ability to work in a team atmos-
phere. Therefore, these organizations instilled in me
the qualification I believe to be representative of a stu-
dent leader and ambassador for the University.
Reasons for running: There are many reasons why
I want to be on the SGB board but to list them all
would be quite lengthy. All of my reasons, though, can
be summed up in one general idea. I care for the well    —
being of the Student Body. It is this very same well- -
being that the SGB is based upon. Recently, some have questioned whether this purpose is
being served. Whether it is or is not remains to be seen. However, the mere fact that a question
has been raised signals to me that a fresh perspective is needed. What it all boils down to is the
Board needs new blood, new people to represent the students with integrity and honor. I want
the SGB to reaffrrrn its respectability and support for the student body. I know that if elected I
can aid in doing  I can represent the student body because the strident body represents me.
Goals gfelectect If elected my primary focus would be to represent and address the concerns
and ideas of the student body. I want to continue to develop the academic and social well being
of the students as well as the University. Speciﬁcally, I will base my perfonnance and decision
in accordance with the interests and needs of the University and the student body. I want to
revaluate and restructure the course selection process, in particular have professor and course
evaluations easily accessible to the students, enhance school spirit and be available to address.
the concerns of the students.

Reason for running: Being at the University for the last two years, I have seen
the division of the student body and the lack of unity within it. This has moti-

has proved to me that I can make a difference.

Goals if elected: My goal for running is to make sure that the students’ voices
are heard and their needs are met. A main concern of students at the present time
is insufficient housing. I will attempt to encourage the University to acquire more
University owned housing. I will also continue my efforts to establish a “Pitt
Proud Community” and create amore unified student body.

Steven Iialsamidis

Year; Major: Junior, Interdisciplinary Studies -
Qualiﬁcations: I was a dedicated member
of the Allocations Committee that resigned
this fall. I was ' also a member of the
Governmental Relations Committee my
freshman year. I know and understand the
Allocations process, its regulations and "poli-
cies. I also understand the relationship that is
supposed to exist between the Allocations
Committee and the SGB. My hands on expe- _
rience and interactions in the SGB office qual- ’ ‘V
ify me for the Student Government Board
because I am familiar with, and prepared for
what to expect this upcoming term.

Reasons for running: My involvement with
the Allocations‘Committee was a sensational
experience. I have gained a working knowledge of not only the SGB, but of
the student organizations as well. I have seen the strong and weak points of
campus life from a variety of perspectives. I believe I know what the major
problems are and I am prepared to offer solutions. If elected, I plan to dedi-
cated' the next year of my life to creating a better campus.

Goals if elected: 1. Communication: I would like to establish and improve the
communicationsnetworks of the University. It seems as if students never know
what is happening on campus. Our university has a lot to offer its students, it’s
time people knew what available. Improving communications will prevent
unnecessary problems from occurring, as well as more easily offer solutions. 2.
Student Intergration to the University: I plan to improve student orientation and
intergration to the University. I don’t feel students become familiar enough with
Pitt’s avaliabilities until they are practically ready to graduate. 3. Residence Life:
I would like to rebuild the Resident Student Association. I feel the majority of
residence problems could be solved with a strong RSA. Problems such as this
years over-crowding could’ve been avoided with strong representation from
the students. .

ly, as it seems that previous SGB’s haven't

they should. I would also like to see an

with this, I think that the amount of the fee
should be looked into, and possibly
reduced.

Goals 1/'elected:Look into the spending of .

student money, and see if it is done fairly. Look for a suitable way to reduce
the Student Activity Fee. Look into the way groups are run to determine if
they warrant what amount of funds they receive. Strive to bring the SGB into
the a positive light in the students eyes by making sure it has no reason to be
tarnished in their eyes. Represent the student body justly and honesty.

Blowout loss overshadowed by near-tragedy on road trip

Four Panther hockey players hurt in accident and miss, game, team loses 16-] to PSU

Rachel Lenzi

Staff Writer

Another day, another painful
shellacking for the Pitt hockey
team. ,

The hockey team traveled to
Happy Valley to spark the fierce
Penn State—Pitt rivalry, but the
Panthers left declawed and disarmed

as the Nittany Lions rocked and

rolled over them, 16-1.

This is the Panthers’
blowout loss in as many games, as
Pitt repeated the same mistakes it
made in its loss to Indiana
University of Pennsylvania the
week before. Pitt’s inability to
recover from an early lead, to con-
vert on the power play and to play
an all-around game of hockey hurt
the Panthers as they faced off
against one of their toughest oppo-
nents so far.

But despite the loss, many of the
Panthers claimed that the score was
meaningless.

“The score didn’t say anything
about the game,” said backup goal-
tender Dave Ciarletta, who yielded
six goals in the third period.

Teammate Ryan Moore agreed.

tLoag£Day%:
@gEt”

Gnu;

second '

“They played tough and we
played tough,” said Moore.
“Everyone came out, hit hard and
hit well. I was impressed. The score
dictates what happens, though.”

Penn State took to the offensive
early, tallying two goals in the first
minute of play against goalie
Patrick Kenny. The Lions chalked
up their third goal at 4:23 of the first
period, and went on to score two
more before the end of the period.

The Panthers looked to start a
rally at the beginning of the second
period. Moore tallied the Panthers’
only goal at 1:03 of the second peri-
od. It was a shorthanded goal on an
assist from winger Kris Getzik to
make the game 5-1.

“We got a lucky break, caught
them on a two—on-one and I gave the
puck to Kris, who dished it back to
me as I got around the defense, and
I just put the puck in the net,” said
Moore. “It’s too bad we couldn’t
score more.”

Kenny surrendered five more
goals before being lifted at the end
of the second period.

Sophomore backup Ciarletta
carried the Panthers for the remain-
der of the game, facing 21 shots and

giving up six goals for a final score
of 16-1. 1

But the loss to Penn State wasn’t
the real concern at hand for the
Panthers. En route to State College,
the Panthers lost four of their play-
ers for the weekend when the car
they were traveling in was involved
in an accident outside Monroeville.

Jared Sullivan, Dan Lenza,
Adam Frieze and Derrick Bauer
were driving on a slippery I-376
when their car, a Toyota Corolla dri-
ven by Frieze, spun out on the wet
road at the I—376—Route 22 split and
careened onto a grassy area on the
side of the highway.

The car was totaled, but none of
the players were injured.

As a precautionary measure,
none of the players continued their
road trip to Penn State. All four
players are expected to be back in
uniform next weekend when the
Panthers take their ‘longest road trip
of the season for a game against
Navy.

“The accident was tough,”
admitted Moore. “My center [Jared
Sullivan] was in it, and I lost him
for the afternoon.”

Penn State registered an alarm-

ing 76 shots on goal, bombarding
Kenny with 55 shots in the first two
periods of play and continuing the
assault on Ciarletta in the third peri-
od with 21 more.

Penn State capitalized on the
man advantage and scored four
power-play goals in the contest.

Eleven Nittany Lions registered
at least two points apiece en route to
the win, while three Lions tallied
four points in the contest: Dan
Horowitz (2 goals and 2 assists),
Mike Werkheiser (1 goal, 3 assists)
and Josh Josephson (2 goals, 2
assists).

The Panthers’ weak defense has
given up 31 goals in the last two
games, while the offense has man-
aged only two goals in the two con-
tests.

Pitt’s record drops to 1-3 with
the loss. Next weekend the Panthers
travel to Annapolis, Md. to take on
the Naval Academy midshipmen on
Friday afternoon, then return to take
on Slippery Rock in a late—night
affair at 10:15 Saturday night in

1 Meadville.

Sunday afternoon, the Panthers
face off against the Steel City Stars
at 3:30 in Cranberry.

Geoff Moak

Staff Writer

At the beginning of this season,
someone made a comment to Pitt
cross country Head Coach ‘Dave

Sobal. He doesn’t even remember‘

who said it, but it’s been in his head
all weekend: “Sometimes, things need
to get worse before they get better.”
The good news for the Pitt men’s
and women’s cross country teams is
that things have already gotten worse.

The bad news is that it happened at _

the worst possible time — at the Big
East championship meet in New York
City’s Van Cortlandt Park last Friday.

The men finished in 11th place of
the 13 teams in the conference, and
the women placed 12th.

Providence won its third consecu-
tive women’s title, scoring 52 points
to barely beat out Georgetown’s 58.
The men’s race wasn’t quite so close.
Notre Dame won with 50 points.
Providence_was second with 74.

Pitt’s top female runner was
sophomore Chantee Earl. She came in
58th place with a personal record time
of 19:42 for the five-kilometer
course.

“Obviously, Chantee ran very
well. I think her other races this year
have been substandard. This race is
what she was capable of doing,”

THE PITT NEWS

Runners bottom out at Big East Championships

Sobal said.

It was the rest of the team that had
a bad day. Rounding out Pitt’s top five
were Amy Francy in 61st place in
19:46, Anna Kohler in 64th in 19:49,
Lynda Andros in 90th place in 20:20
and Sarah McMillen in 94th in 20:27.

Andros, who had been Pitt’s sec-
ond runner all season, injured her
hamstring earlier in the week and
wasn’t 100 percent for the race.

“She refuses to accept that as a
reason for not running well,” Sobal
said. “Lynda Andros at 95 percent is
better than a lot of people.”

Whether there was a reason for
their poor performance or not, the
Panthers would like to run this meet
again.

“We certainly could have been
10th, but even ninth or eighth weren’t
far out of reach,” Sobal said. “A lot of
teams came out of this meet scratch-
ing their heads. We’re one of them.
We feel bad being in 12th place, but
how does Villanova feel in sixth?
We’re not alone.”

Villanova’s women came into the
meet ranked seventh in the nation, but
finished in sixth place in the confer-
ence, despite having the top two indi-
vidual finishers, Carrie Tollefson and
Carmen Douma, who had times of
16:54 and 17:12.

Pitt’s men had a better day than

the women.

“The men didn’t have great races,
but collectively, they didn’t run as
poorly as the women,” Sobal said.

Actually, one of the men did have
a very good race. Mike Orzechowski
had the best race of his young career
at just the right time. He finished 45th
with a time of 26:28 for the eight—mile
course.

Matt Samuel was Pitt’s second
runner in 71st place with a time of
27:22. After that, Pitt’s top five was
full of rookies. John Becker was 80th
in 27:44, Max Itkin was 82nd in 27:48
and Justin Wiley was 93rd in 28:12.

Connecticut’s Travis Landreth
won the race with a time of 24:49.

For both the Panther men and
women, the fact that so many runners
are underclassmen is a bright spot of
this meet. The Big East championship
is normally held at Van Cortlandt Park
every other year, and Sobal made sure
to prepare his team for 1999, when
most of these runners should be hit-
ting their primes. .

After the race, Sobal had his
teams run the course again to keep
this race in the back of their minds
two years from now.

“You can’t make a difference in a
day, or even a month,” Sobal said.
“We began to do the groundwork to
be good by the time we come back.”

Hoya goalkeeper Natalie Guigno

FROM PAGE 10

_answered with her own sparkling

saves. Guigno stopped Panther lead-
ing scorer Renee Spampinato late in
the second frame, when the Panther
was all alone in front of the net. At the
end of regulation, the Panthers had

- outshot the Hoyas 14-11.

The first overtime featured
intense play from both teams.
Freshman forward Charity McClure

had a point-blank shot stopped by the -

Hoya keeper. McClure would have
another opportunity with only a
minute left, but was robbed "again by a
diving keeper.

The second overtime featured

\

much more rough play. .

At the 100258 mark, Panthe
enforcer Vanessa Madison would
exchange blows with Georgetown’s
Melissa Coleman. Both players
brawled it out and received yellow
cards as a result.

The fight fired up the Panthers, as
Megan Beasley and Charity Kriley
both had key opportunities to score
for Pitt. But, as had been happening to
both squads for much of the game,
neither Panther could put it home.

At the 114116 mark, McClure
finally cracked through the Hoya
defense, banging in the winning goal
for Pitt on a breakaway. McClure fin-
ished the game with a school-record
10 shots.

her fifth shutout of the season. The
victory equaled last season’s total of
three wins for the Panthers, and was
enough to give the team sole posses-
sion of 10th place in the Big East
Conference. A

“These are the little victories that
pay of,” said Panther Head Coach
Roland Sturk. “It was an ugly game
but a good victory, a great way to fin-
ish the [conference] season.”

On Sunday, the Panthers lost a 1-
0 defensive battle to the Virginia
Commonwealth Rams at Nichols
Field, finishing the season. The Rams
did not expect such a battle after last
season’s 6-0 rout of the Panthers.

The first half featured much
offensive effort by the Rams. The
majority of the action took place deep
in Panther territory, but Bashor kept
the Rams scoreless by making five
saves in the first frame.

In the second half, Virginia
picked up where it left off with early

offensive attacks. Ram defenseman<

Shannon Ziegenfuss scored at the
69:13 mark. Ziegenfuss would finish
the game with four shots.

The‘ goal would never be

answered. The Panthers and Rams
played a very physical game in the
second half, especially Pitt midfielder
Megan Beasley. She drew a yellow

card for her rough play, but was not

able to spark the Pitt offense.

Virginia Commonwealth would
hold on for the victory, despite anoth-
er all-star performance from goalie
Bashor, who made 11 saves in the
loss.

Bashor ended the season with an
impressive 1.98 goals—against aver-
age. The freshman recorded 105 saves
and five shutouts in 14 games this
season. 1'

With her overtime goal on Friday
night, freshman forward McClure
nailed down the team lead in scoring
with two goals and two assists.
Freshman‘ Charity Kriley led all
defensemen with a goal andan assist,
and also led the team with 30 shots.

The Panthers finished their season
with a 3-12-3 record overall, and 2-8-
1 in the Big East. Pitt improved its
record slightly over last season’s 3-16
record in only its second season of
play and its first in conference com-
petition.

salary, or wherever it is tax dollars cur-
rently go.

From a statistical, logical, undeni-
ably civic-minded standpoint, there are
thousands of places where this half
cent should go besides the creation of
USX Park or Clark Bar Stadium or
Rambo: Forbes Field Part II or what-
ever the new ﬁeld(s) will be named.

But this is a city filled with sports
fans, and sports fans hate logic.

Logically, the Pirates didn’t have a
prayer of remaining in a pennant race
until the last week of this season.
Theoretically, the Steelers should not
be able to win football games without
Chad Brown on defense. Statistically
speaking, Bill Mazeroski’s home run
probably should never have happened.

It makes no mathematical sense for
people to become near lunatics over
sporting events.‘ But we do it anyway,
and we love each and every second of
it. Be it the collective gasp the city
took as Jim Harbaugh’s pass kissed off
the wom-down Three Rivers turf, the
jubilation of a no—hitter on ﬁreworks
night, or the simple camaraderie of a
tailgate free-for—all, we love it.

And if we’re not willing to pay
another couple of bucks per year, we
could lose part of it. Or worse.

Do not attack this issue as one of
principle and economics. It isn’t. This
is about sports — something that, for
some of us, is a tad more important
than dropping a few extra pennies on
every trip to Rite Aid.

Those with axes to grind can suc-
cessfully argue that this is an issue of
corporate welfare — of slowly robbing
the citizenry of their hard-earned half-
pennies to feed an unwieldy giant that
wears a cap with a gold “P” and a red
bill.

Rather than quote economists
extolling the virtues of convention cen-
ter repairs and other issues also being
funded by the proposal, or launch into
a tirade about the need for private-pub-
lic business cooperation, let’s just keep
it idiot—proof: If it takes a few pennies
of corporate welfare to keep our teams
in town, so be it.

Now is not the time to argue ethics;
now is the time to save the Pirates.
This may be the last chance to do so
before the city has to start shaving big
bucks off other programs in an expen-
sive, 1ast—ditch attempt to keep the
team.

Now that’s statistically stupid.-Get
to the polls early, vote to help pass the
initiative, and feel safe knowing that
Pirates baseball will be in town, in a
brand—new stadium, for the foreseeable
future. It’s a worthwhile investment;

Unlike, for example, investing in
Dan Dierdorf.

Pitt News.
