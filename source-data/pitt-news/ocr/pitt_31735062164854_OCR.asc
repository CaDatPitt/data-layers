  Litchfield Resigns as Chan

Kurtzman Institutes
Financial Changes

By DONALD FRIEDMAN

Dr. David Kurtzman, vice-chancellor of finance, is al-
ready deeply involvedin the University’s ﬁnancial structure,
although hehas only been on the job for one week.

Ironically, some of Dr. Kurtzman’s ﬁrst duties found
him adding money in some budget areas, despite the fact
that he was hired to help keep a tighter check on expenses.

Dr. Kurtzman explained ‘ that
“some accounts were-cut unreal-
istically, without consulting the
people in charge of those areas.”
These people came to him and
the "budgets were revised, with
the additional money coming

from contingency funds. \

Dr. Kurtzman said that a num-
ber of steps are being taken to
institute budget controls. The
controls “are nothing out of the
ordinary,” he said, “they are just
new here .at the University.”

’ Primarily these controls involve
an expansion of the monthly bud-
get performance report. At pres-
ent the report shows only the-
amount allocated for each ac-
count, the amount spent as of the
end“ of the last full month, and
the net amount left to be spent.

Dr. Kurtzman explained that

the reports will'be more detailed .

in the future, showing the maxi-
mum amount which can be spent

' monthly in order to stay within

the budget. With the new reports,
it will be possible to determine
at a glance whether a particular
account is running ahead of its
allocation.

Personnelcontrols will also be
introduced, Dr. Kurtzman said. A
check will be made of the people
on the payroll to determine if
their number and salary are con-
sistent with the payroll .account.
If the check shows that the sal-
aries will be geater than the
budgeted amount, the situation
will be corrected before the mon-
ey is spent, probably by cutting

Ten Year Report

Wider Approaches

(This is the final in the series
of articles discussing the progress
of the University in the. lastten
years as described in the Uni-
versity-published “Report to the
Community/.”)

To avoid ‘narrow special-
ization in one academic niche
the University has expanded
its programs to include in-
terdisiplinary and interna-
tional approaches which
mean a “cross-seeding” from
one discipline to another and a
funneling oftthe accumulation of
knowledge from scholar to pro-
fessional.

Since 1955, the University has
established nine centers to foster
the interdisciplinary objectives,

including the Learning Research '

and Development Center, the
Center for Regional Economic
Studies, and the Center for Phil-

 
   

» the culturesof othernations. Uni-

down the number of people on
the «payroll.

Dr. Kurtzman’s position is dif-
ferent from that of former Act-
ing Vice-Chancellor of Finance
Jesse Hudson and from that of
Vice-Chancellor of Business Af-
fairs -Lawrence Monnett in that
Dr. Kurtzman is responsible not
only to the Chancellor, but also
to the Budget-Audit Committee
of the Board of Trustees.

.In the ‘past. if the Chancellor
disagreed with a statement by the
vice-chancellor, the statement got
no farther than the Chancellor,
but now the~Budget-Audit Com-
mittee will hear Dr. Kurtzman’s
views whether or not they are in
agreement with those of the
Chancellor.

This change‘ does not imply a
basic alteration in the role of
the Chancellor. He still will h.ave
ﬁnal responsibility for the bud-
get, but under the new system,
there will be more consultation
before the ﬁnal budget is ap-
proved.

Dr. Kurtzman said that he is
also trying_to increase mechaniz-
ation of the auditing system, so
that it~will be possible to get out
the monthly reference sheets
within a few days after the end
of each month, eliminating the
three month lag. In line with this
attempt, he pointed out that it
may be necessary to restrict out-
side‘ use of the computer center,
or at least give this use second
preference, so that the Universi-
ty’s ﬁnances can be given the
most attention.

the Center for Regional Economic
Studies conducted the first eco-

Over 1,000 volunteers worked
on this year’s campaign which
went far beyond last year’s total
of $369,481 from 6,015 alumni.
The department expects to raise
much more next year with goals
over the 551/; million mark.

The campaign is “reaching

Dr. Edward H. Litchﬁeld’ resigned his position as ‘

Chancellor in -a written statement delivered at a press con-
ference in his office yesterday afternoon. 

' In a‘ letter written to Chairman of the Board Gwilym  
Price July 20 and read yesterday by Joseph Colangelo, di- .

rector of public relations, Dr. Litchﬁeld said that while‘ in
the Virgin Islands he had had time to think about “our general sit-

uation at some length” and “in the light of many considerations” felt _l  

he should ask the Board of Trustees to accept his-resignation.

The University will continue, under the administraton of acting 7 it

Chancellor Stanton Crawford until a new Chancellor is selected by

a Board committee as yet to be
appointed.

In a letter dated July 26, Price _
, accepted the resignation (effec-

tive immediately) for the Board
of Trustees after conferring by
telephone with the. Trustees.

Price expressed appreciation in
the letter that Dr. Litchﬁeld had
done “more for the University in
one decade than most men could
have accomplished in a half cen-
tury..9’ - . ‘

Price continued that Dr. Litch-
ﬁeld could never leave the Uni-
versity because it is “inextricably
bound up” with his “vision.” He
was, conﬁdent that recent prob-
lems “are on‘ the way toward a
solution” and hoped that future
leaders would be able to continue
Dr. Litchﬁeld’s “momentum to-
ward quality.” \

Neither Dr. Litchﬁeld nor Price
was present at the conference
nor had either sent additional
statements because both felt that
the letters were sufficient.

End of War
Requested .
  In Letter

A letter calling for a ces-
sation of the American
bombing of North Vietna-
mese military targets and a

‘halting of ground war esca-
'lation has been signed by
'50 Pittsburghers, including 14

University faculty members. The

_ letter also urged the Saigon gov-

ernment to negotiate with the
insurgent National Liberation
Front. .

Many of the signers are mem-
bers of the Pittsburgh Ad Hoc
Committee on Vietnam, headed
by William H. Rodd II.

The signers acknowledged the
frustrating circumstances which
led to the Johnson administra-
tion’s decision to increase Ameri-
can military involvement. They
asserted, however, that the de-
sired results have not been
achieved, since the North Viet-
namese government has remain-
ed intransigent.

The letter expressed the fear
that “a rapid deterioration of
U.S.-Soviet relations,” and “an
increasing pro-Chinese attitude on
the part of the North-Vietnamese

students for their support “in re-

Well, it’s official now. After months of rumors, many
of them vicious and most of them untrue, Chancellor Ed-
Lward H. Litchﬁeld has handed in his resignation.

_ ‘U The past few months have been troubled ones for the
University and no doubt for Dr.’ Litchﬁeld. The months to
come should now be much less troubled for the Chancellor,

-E but the future of the University is still in doubt The fact

}__jthat it is now operating without a leader of Dr. Litchﬁeld’s
proven quality makes its future even more doubtful.

 Now is not the time ‘to whitewash every mistake the
VP Chancellor ever made. Now is not the time to glorify him
 as a great hero of the past. Now is the time to acknowledge
 — his great positive contributions to the University and to
 _dis_cern and proﬁt from his mistakes, so that the University
.9?  may continue to take giant strides along the "path down
I a which he guided it. . _ .

3 Chancellor Litchﬁeld’s dynamic personality made it al-
most impossible for people to entertain neutral feelings to-
ward him. He was strongly disliked or wildly acclaimed by
V ‘those who knew him and worked with him. His decision to
‘ resign will likewise meet with strong and variant opinions.
It is the students who have beneﬁted most obviously by
what Dr. Litchﬁeld has attempted to do here, and it is only

   
  

logical that they would be the ﬁrst to recognize his achieve-'

ments. In the years to come, the rest of Western Pennsyl-
 .vania will realize how a university of the stature of Dr.
 Litchﬁeld’s Pitt serves much more than just the students.
I ‘ There are people who have- not beneﬁted directly from
the Chancellor’s leadership at the University, and others

i A who are capable of thinking only in terms of this year’s
balance sheet. These and others who disagreed with Chan-
cellor Litchﬁeld over one matter or another can sit back

- now and glory in their triumph.

But theirs is a hollow victory. As Dr. Litchﬁel-d said in

~ , ‘his resignation statement, “the passage of time and current
surveys” will show the “marked progress toward the’ goal

 of a great regional university.” Let not that goal be lost
 among the mixed outcries at the resignation of Chancellor

A voice is" calling. “It’s
time to leave.”

The end has come. After

three years, nine trimesters,

and 125 credits, it’s time to
leave. It ‘hurts.

You've complained; not as
much as some
people, but
you’ve . com-

though, it all
looks differ-
ent. They tell
y o u you’re
moving on to
bigger and
better things,
_  ' and you have
FRIEDMAN to agree with
them. But still you don’t
want to leave.

You knew it would be like
this at the end. You didn’t
want to ‘think about it, so
you kept very busy. What
did you do? You don’t know;
you were just busy. Don't
think about it——it hurts.

Your friends. What about

 

your friends? You’ve work--

ed with them and played
with them. They meant so
much to you. Are you ever
going to see them again? Of
course, you say". But next
year. is 700 miles away. How
are you going to see them?
When?

That’s the part that really

hurts—leaving the people..

Not that leaving the build-
ings will be much easier.
They have personalities too.
One building —— classes, an-
other building — you hated
the teacher in there, another
building —-— work, another

plained. Now,

building——a home away from
home, and yet another ‘—-
your greatest involvement of
all. Greater than people,
greater than classes, greater
than work, you made it you.
Its mistakes were yours, its
glories were yours. And now
it’s someone else’s. That
hurts too, more than any-
thing else.

“It’s over. So what ?” Talk
yourself out of it. You might
make it easier. But it doesn't
work. "

“So'what? I !” Do you real-
ly want to know? How long
do you have? Four hours?
Four days? I’ll tell you so
what.

Do you know who you
are? Even a little bit? Yes,
you have a pretty good idea

who you are. Why? Because '

They made you think. You

don’t know . who or what-
. They are, "but you know what
They ‘did for you. In the long i

run, you know the classes
aren’t important. Unfortun-
ately, the grades may be

‘even though the classes

weren’t, but you know that
there was something much

_more important than classes

and grades. It Won’t be on
any record you can produce,
and maybe nobody else will
even see it, but you know it’s
there.

Ifiyou were really leaving
— leaving completely — it
wouldn't be so bad. But you
know that you’re not. Sure

you’re going to be 700 miles
away, but the important
thing is the part of you that
doesn't leave. Are you really
going to leave part of you

here? Yes, maybe too much. ~

Not so much in the minds of
other people. That’s not the
important ,thing, because
they'll forget who you are
(if they ever knew) and
what you did. But in your
own mind, you know, you
are convinced, that you’re
going to be here next year,
andrthe year after that. And
maybe forever.

You can't just leave. It
shaped you, and you helped
to shape it. It's impossible to

leave after all that you’ve .

done together. You will al-
ways be here. You’ve grown
-——there’s. more of you now
———because now it’s part of
you. ‘ '

Suddenly ‘you understand
why it hurts. You said it
hurts to leave. But you were
wrong. It ‘really. hurts be-

’ cause you know you can't

leave. You're caught, trap-
ped forever-—by a three-year
love affair.

High School Teachers
Study at Institute Here

By KAREN TOKAR

“To increase fluency and ability in handling‘ the French
Language, and to develop some insights into professional
skills,” is the aim set by Dr. Benjamin W. Haseltine, pro-
fessor of Romance Languages, for the National Defense
Education Summer Institute. The institute is a seven week
program for secondary school French teachers ending Au-

gust 13. i
The “student-teachers” are
from 14 different states and
Washington, D. C; a cosmopolitan
approach which helps to show
what is going on in French teach-

_ing throughout the country.

French is the only language
spoken in the progr.am which
takes place from 8:30 a.m. to 5

pm. with occasional evening pro-

grams. The schedule includes
French ﬁlms, guest speakers, and
poetry‘ "readings.

The daily schedule includes
applied linquistics, phonetics,
methodology, French culture and
civilization, a conversational hour
with native speakers, laboratory,
and class demonstrations.

Seven exams were given to the

group on the ﬁrst day in listen-I

ing, speaking, reading, writing,
applied linguistics, culture and
civilization and‘ professional prep-
aration. Another form of the
same exam will be given on the
last day which will reveal any
signiﬁcant group gains.

Applications for the clinic were
taken from February to March,
and 40 of the 283 applicants were
selected by computor in Wash-
ington, D. C. ‘ .

The participants receive a stip-

ent of $75 perweek plus $15 per‘
dependant, but pay for their own
books, lodging" (in the towers), V

and transportation.
Any..participant completing this

institute; the- fourth at the Uni-

versity, is eligible for an over-
sea’s institute.

Nesbitt Gets
Day Award

 For Service

Elizabeth Nesbitt, who recently

retired from the University’s

Graduate School of Library and
Information Sciences, received the
Clarence Day Award for serving

“librarianship with distinction at ‘

home and abroad.”

The award, presented at the
American Library Association’s
84th Annual Conference in De-

troit, .Mich., cited Miss Nesbitt,

for “a lifetime of work with
children, children’s librarians,
and children’s literature.

The citation said" her recent
writings “continue the notable
contribution to the history and
appreciation of children’s litera-
ture made over many years.”.

  For Study

The Buhl Foundation awarded
a one year grant of »$87,000 to
the University’s‘ '-Learning Re-
search and Development Center
to increase the University’s cap-
abilities for rendering school im-
provement services in the Pitts-
burgh area. I

The grant is the fourth of a
series in whichthe Buhl Founda-
tion’s support has initiated edu-
cational research and develop-
ment projects bringing additional
funds to the community.

Dean Paul H. Masoner of the
School of Education explained
that the grant will further de-
velopment along three principal
lines. These are (1) a computer-
base electronic laboratory for the
investigation of learning prob-
lems, (2) studies of ‘early child-
hood development essential for
the guidance of the new pre-
school programs being instituted
in many neighborhoods, .and (3)
the mobilizing of resources in
many area colleges to provide a
variety of school improvement
services.

County otes To Tax -
Chancellor’s Residence

The board’s decision will make
taxable $72,360 of the $108,550
value of the home. The City Of
Pittsburgh, the Pittsburgh Board
of Education, and the county will
all be able to levy taxes on the
mansion.

The decision is subject to ap-
peal in the courts.

The home, an estate of H. J.
Heinz, II, was purchased.by the
University for $150,000. Remodel-
ing costs came to $100,000. The
estate is located in a plush neigh-
borhood near Fifth Ave. and has
a 12 car garage on its six acre
lot. ‘ V

' I"

The Allegheny County Board
of -Assessors voted last week to
Eimake 40 per cent of the assessed
value of the Chancellor’s home
" taxable.

The mansion at 5090 Warrick
T Terrace has been the center of
controversy since its acquisition
in 1961. The probflem arose over
the question of whether or not
-. thetChancellor’s home should be
taxed. The University claims
_that the home is “necessary” for
.,ffa top quality school and hence
' should not be taxed. The, county
' maintains that the Chancellor can
live in a more modest home
without harming himself or the
school.‘ ‘
