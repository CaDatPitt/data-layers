Prejudice
Dividing
Phi Eps

The University of Connecticut
chapter of Phi Epsilon Pi has
two more chapters fighting its

recent suspension from the national
orga nization. .

According to the Jewish Times of
Boston, chapters at Boston Univer-
sity and Tufts College have voted to
support the Connecticut group which
pledged a Negro over the blackball
of the grand council.

The Associated College Press
reported that the grand council, rul-
ing body of the national fraternity,
blackballed the Negtolast June.This
action was sustained at the national
convention.

Still Blackballed

In September, the Upsilon chapter
at Connecticut gave the National
Grand Council two weeks to remove
its_ blackball before disaffiliating.
Instead, the council suspended the
chapter and impounded its funds,

, according to the Connecticut Univer-

sity “Campus.”

More than 15 chapters were reported
ready to 'disaffiliate if the Upsilon
chapter wasn’t re-installed. At the
insistence of this chapter, however,
no chapters took this action and all
havedecidet’ to hold areferendum to
decide the issue. ‘ -

No action has been taken to date.

General Support
The feeling ofmostchapters seems
to be closely akin to that stated by
the Boston University chapter as
reported in the Jewish Times. The
president of that group said: "we’re
going to support the Connecticut
chapter alltheway up to the poi
withdrawal.”

The University of Pittsburgh C
ter stated tnrougn its president

Faigen, that it had not change
position since the trouble st
That position was that they
served the right to pledge who
they please, but did not suppo
action contrary to the wish -
majority.”

All across the nation politicalgobserve

the outcome of the senatorial races.
Of particular interest are the Taft-
.Ferguson and Duff-Myers senatorial
contests in Ohio and Pennsylvania.

Pennsylvania’s leading candi-
dates for the two top offices in
today's state election are: James
H.Duff,(Rep.)and Francis J.Myers,
(Dem.), for senator; Richardson Dil-
worth, (Dem.), and John 5. Fine,
(Rep.) for governor.

Campaigned Here

The top Democratic candidates in
the state election, Senator Francis
J.Myers, who is seeking re-election
and Richardson Dilworth, aspirant
for the governorship, completed a
whirlwind tour over the Pittsburgh
district last week. The drive was
climaxed here by a "Students for
Myers-Dilworth Dance” on Thurs-
day night, Nov. 2, at the Schenley
Hotel.

So far, Pitt students show a pre-
ference for the Duff-Fine GOP
‘Slate. With 5 percent of the student
body of 7532 polled the Duff-Fine
ticket still maintains its lead in
the student opinion poll conducted
by the Pitt News.

By DAVE LIPMAN

The 1950 Pitt Chest Drive starts tomorrow.

The Chest Drive workers will now go into action after two
weeks of familiarizing the student body with the Community
Chest, its functions, and its purposes.

Student speakers will visit all classes during the third and
sixth hours and make an appeal on behalf of the Pitt Chest Drive .

At the conclusion of their appeal, the speakers will pass out
Chest Drive contribution envelopes.

The student can either make this contribution in cash at once,
or make a pledge and pay it at the Student Desk not later than

Letter Club

By DON SHARAPAN

Rocco Cutri, '33, bus ad alumnus and former football and
basketball star,,plans to start the first out-of-town chapter of the

Pitt l_.ettermen"s Club.

It is to be located in Los Angeles, California.
Dr. Leo Malarkey, a Dormont dentist, and a letterman, said

that its by-laws and purpose - to
create an interest in Pitt athletics

Tormey, and Len Rector, all liv-
ing in Los Angeles.

May Set Pattern

that the new chapter might encour-

.age lettermen in other parts of the

country to organize chapters in
their localities.

An unscheduled but well-
attended concert filled the Com-

day afternoon as the Polytech
Chorus of Finland sang a group

of songs for about 200 students
gathered in the room.

The all male chorus visited the

again returned to the Commons
Room and entertained parents
attending the Chancellor’s recep-

Tour States

Pittsburgh is one of the major
cities in which this chorus has ap-
peared during its tour of the United
States.

Choral singing has taken an im-
portant place at the school since
the chorus was founded in 1904.

The chorus has been recognized
by leading American critics. Ac-
cording to Marshall Bartholomew,
conductor of the Yale Glee Club,
the Polytech Chorus is one of the
finest amateur singing groups in

Miss Zeligman particularly em-

continually leaving books, papers,
coats, lunches and even the remains
of food on the tables and chairs
and frequently on the floor.

by the "Young Panther,” com-
posed -of eight cars.

“ Like I say, Worthol -- when you come in late you disturb the
whole class."

Coffee vs Spirit

Yesterday, during the second hour, a large part of the stu-
dent body crossed Fifth Avenue and trooped up to Soldiers and
Sailors Memorial to express its thanks to the team for Saturday’s
victory.

During‘ that’ same hour an even larger part of the student pop-
ulation double-crossed the team and trooped down to the Tuck
Shops and Cafeteria.

Since the administration had granted an hour for the express
purpose of a rally, anyone who stayed away to drink coffee in the
Tuck Shop and recount the details ofhis big weekend was essent-
iallydisplaying his complete lack of faith in the team. If he could
go to the Tuck Shop, he certainly could have gone to the rally.

All of this makes us wonder what kind of students hang out
in the Tuck Shop. They all seem to be typically collegiate in
their dress and certainly they seem to be avid joiners. Perhaps,
these Tuck Shop “commandos” are little more than campus
Babbits without a Babbit’s drive.

Arise! Vote

Today is election day for students as well as for “civic-
minded” citizens and politicians. We hope that those students
who are eligible to vote will do so if it is physically possible.
We also hope that the faculty will take a kindly View of a cut
for voting.

While urging everyone to vote, we do not necessarily insist
that the election in this state is either crucial or significant. It
is more a contest between personalities rather than issues.

Since University policy forbids campus organizations from
taking a political stand, we, therefore, throw all -of our support
to voting. We think every student over twenty one should make
his appearance at the polls sometime today.

Paragraph Wisdom

According to a poll conducted by the journalism department,
98 per cent of the student body reads the Pitt News. We, some-
what modestly, conclude that this is the literacy rate on campus.

Overset

BY DAVE WINTER

That dance last Thursday
night sponsored by the “Stu-
dents for Myers-Dilworth” was
full of surprises.

The first surprise was the
fact that Pitt grads made up the
majority of the Democratic lea-
ders who stood up andltook a
bow.

One of the candidates present
was 27-year-old W.I. Newsretter,
]r., son of the dean of the School
of Social Work who is bucking
James G. Fulton for the job of
representative from the thirty-first
Congressional district.

The second surprise was the
relatively small size of the crowd.
Students from the five Pittsburgh

colleges were invited to hear
Democratic candidates and Ben
Benack’s band in the Schenley

Ballroom, all for free. Only a week

before it cost $2.25 per couple for
the same package, minus politics,
at Pitt’s Homecoming Dance.

Cigarette Commercial

One Pitt student got the surprise
of the night, though. He was danc-
ing with a girl from Mt. Mercy, and
started to apologize because he
hadn’t had a chance toishave since
morning, when she cut him off
sweetly with, "Yes, I noticed you
are wearing your "throat scratch"
on the outside tonight.”

Another "student pointed out a
cute, merry little co-ed whom he
called a "very punny individual.”
Seems he had dated the girl several
times, and every time he took her

TV and ND

By CLARK SUTTON

We’re all assumingithat if the
Pitt band goes to Notre Dame we
will all get a chance to watch their
exceptional performance on rele-
vision. This is only an assumption.
v In the past, the sponsors of the
program takes the field. This would
be a great blow to all those who
have worked to give the Band a
chance to strut their stuff before
the millions of TV viewers.

We do not suggest that the com-
merical be eliminated. After all,
the sponsors are enabling those of
us who can't attend to watch the
game free of charge. And they
certainly have a right to try and
sell us their product. But we do
suggest they try and put their com-
mercial in another part of the pro-
gram other than when our band
takes the field. The good will they
gain by this gesture will more than
make up for any inconvenience in
production schedules.

And this suggestion also goes

for the local station identification
which takes all of 60 seconds for
them to tell us it’s WDTV. After
all, we all know that Pittsburgi is
blessed with only one station, and
even though they are required by
the FCC to tell us every 30 minutes,
we plead with them not to remind us
of that fact when our Pitt band takes
the field.

Here’s five bucks to throw in the
"Send the Band” drum.

While I usually go to a football ,

game to watch football and pay
little or no attention to the bands,
the Pitt band has always been one
exception. In fact, I well remember
a few times when the band "out-
played” the football team.

You've got a good idea working

in trying to get our band before .

the nation’s television viewers
at Notre Dame. I wish we’d had
something as worthwhile to push
with last year's News. I’ve been
watching the drum fill up as the
papers reach me. I hope the drive

makes it.

Cats Felt They Needed
One Win to Get Rolling

By STAN SKIRBOLL

Although the West Virginia contest wasn't much of a criter-
ion, the Pitt football team should begin to roll -- if Mike Boldin,
veteran Panther guard, knows what he is talking about.

Last week, while Pitt was getting smeared by Miami, Boldin
said that all that was needed to get the Blue-and‘Gold started

was a win.

If that is the case, then the Pitt boys should be all hepped

up for their big game against Notre
Dame this Saturday. Except, of
course, beating West Virginia, 21-7,
was no great accomplishment.

Clippings No Help

The Mounties came to the Stad-
ium full of anticipation and a batch
of press clippings about their pass-
ing offense. Neither was much help.

Kent‘Barges, who had replaced
Bill Allen as the Mountaineer
quarterback, failed to complete a
pass in the first half. Allen ran the
West Virginians the rest of ‘the game,
completing only five out of 17 aer-
ials. This should knock West
Virginia out as the top passing

THEAPITT NEWS- Tuesday, ‘November 7, 1950-Page -5 '6

team in the East.

If the Panthers can do as well
against Bob Williams & Co. on
Saturday, then perhaps the‘Fighting
Irish will taste their fourth defeat
of the season.

Everyone Starred

Everyone looked good for the
Panthers, finally, as the line
opened up holes for the backs; the
backs ripped off nice gains; the
defensive team tackled; and the
secondary had a fairly decent pass
defense.

Fullback Joe Capp finally looked
like the fullback Coach Len Casa-

,DISCARDS from

the Sports Shuffle

By WILL DOERGE
Billy Reynolds wasn't treated too kindly by his West Virginia buddies

in Saturd ay’s game .

 

The Panther halfback, who hails from St. Marys, W.Va., was a

marked man. Every chance they
got, the Mountaineers gave Rey-

nolds an extra roughing up.

The bitterness almost led to
blows in the. final quarter when
Mountie End Paul Bischoff poked
Reynolds in the face with his
elbow. Players separated the two
before any further damage was
done. Oddly, though, Bischoff is
not a West Virginian, but a Penn-
sylvania boy from Beaver Falls.

I It It
The grudge between Reynolds
and the West Virginians was only
an the gridiron, however. After
the game, Billy shook hands with
several of his old pals on the
Mountie team.
“They were out for me, all
right," said Reynolds, “but
they're old friends or mine.”
II III II

Ever since Reynolds forsook
West Virginia for Pitt, nothing but
weeping and wailing has been
heard from the hillbillies on the
subject. ,

But you never hear them men-
tion that they have eight Penn-
sylvanians on their own team.
Oh,no.

* it II
In the Pitt dressing room after

the game, the players weren't
excessively jubilant over their
first victory. However, when
Coach Casanova came in and
shouted. “H0w does it feel to
win a ball game?” he was greet-
ed by a loud outburst of cheering
and whooping. .

Then somebody called out:
“The one we want to win is the
Notre Dame game next week,”
And the players chomsed their
approval.

Pitt looked like the single-
wingers of old the way they
ground out yardage Saturday,

picking up 390 yards via rushing.

Fairly TallFreshman Squad
Opens Basketball Practice

For the second consecutive year Pitt’s freshman basketball squad
will place the emphasis on six footers.

This season's group of frosh
yearlings stretch fairly well over
that mark, which certainly was not
the case here prior to last year.

Practice for the cagers begins at
3:37) this afternoon‘ at the Stadium
gym under the direction of Bob Art-
man, assistant athletic director and
frosh basketball coach.

Sari Tallest

Center Dave Sari, a 6-5 candidate
from Rankin High, and 6-4 hoopsters
Tom Pinch of Carrick and Wade Jones
of Avonworth, are the tallest mem-
bers of the squad, while Don Fore-
man of Dormont, at 5-11, holds the
honor of being one of the smallest
of the new crop.

Oil City and Monessen High
schools have contributed two mem-
bers each to the Panther cage year-
lings. Clarance Burch, a six footer,
and Lou Kraft, at 6-2, are the Oil
City representatives while 6-3 Bill
Gillman and 6-2 Alex Novakvich hail
from Monessen.

Expected to see plenty of action

with the frosh is Ed Hood, a member
of last year's Homestead High state
championship team. Hood stands
6-1.

Coach’s Brother Plays
Other Central and Western Penn-
sylvanians scheduled for careful
scrutinizing include Bob Brown, a
6-lcandidate from Bethel and Bernie

CANDIDATES WELCOME

Freshmen are invited to try
out at the opening _9_f frosh bas-
ketballpractice ‘today at3:30!
in the Stadium Pavilion. Eligi-
bility cards must be filled out
in the Athletic office Dl'i0l'
to reporting.

Artman, also 6-1, from Baldwin.
Young Artman is a brother of Coach
Artman.

IRISH SCATBACK - Little Billy
Barrett, Notre Dame halfback, is
a big man in Frank Leahy’s offen-
sive attack which Pitt faces this

week. Barrett goes 180 on the

scales and is a junior.
0 t‘t

nova has been looking for all sea-
son. The Newton Falls, Ohio gridder
racked up 130 yards in 21 tries.

Capp scored twice for the Pan-
thers, once on a three-yard run
through a gaping hole, and again
on a 56-yard jaunt.

Reynolds Scores

The first Pitt tally came on a
pass from Bob Bestwick to Billy
Reynolds on a play that covered
25 yards. Reynolds, who hails
from West Virginia, had a previous
chance to score minutes earlier,
but fumbled on the one-yard line.

The Panthers, who won their
first game for Casanova, will be
out to atone for all the Notre Dame
drubbings they received in former,
lean years.

Although the Irish downed Navy
last Saturday, 19-10, they were
hard-pressed by the Middies.

That Counts

So now comes Notre Dame.

41

Now Comes the (me

. By MYRON KOPELMAN

Sports Editor

The funny thing about college football is that if you whip
‘Notre Dame and lose every other game, your season is still a

success. True, some of the luster
of a win at South Bend has disap-
peared this season, but the Irish
are still the Irish and when you
be at them you are headline stuff.
Obviously, incentive will not be
lacking when the
Panthers go after

their first win
Saturday". Their
, firs_t~-win? Yes,

i even though they
had more points

(21 *7) than West
Virginia last
week, they still

won nothing.

In a losing sea-
'soh fans will be-
come cynical.

Capp
When their ball club defeats a weak- T -
ling like West Virginia, the comment

invariably is, “Well, if they
couldn't win that one, they wouldn’t
have belonged in football suits.” In
other words, if the Panthers had
lost they would have sunk to the

dregs in public thinking; yet by
_'winning, they gained not an iota of
prestige.

Coach Len Casanova's boys are
aware of that fact. They are not
kidding themselves-

Cause to Smile

In as the locker room after
Saturday’s victory,
celebrating. The feeling, in es-
sence, was that “its nice to win
any game, but next week’s is the
one that counts.”

Nevertheless, there was cause

last
there was no

to smile. A little
lineup experiment of his had work-
ed beautifully, even if it had work-
ed against mediocre opposition.

Casanova had switched 210-pound
Ted Geremsky, three years a varsity
end, to offensive tackle for the
West Virginia brawl. Immediately
Gerem sky‘ began opening up holes
that looked like
deserted boule-
vards. Fullback
Joe Capp breezed
through two of
them for touch--
downs.

On defense,
George Glagola
moved into Gerem-
sky's end posi-
tion and held.up
well. He and Joe
Bozek, both so-
phomores, should provide Pitt with
a strong terminal defense in the
years to come - if the Army doesn't
get them.

Atterthoughts

Some of the fans who like double-
features were hoping West Virginia
would win. Freshman‘ Council had
assigned 200 frosh to guard the
goalposts in such an event, and no
doubt a lovely riot would have oc-
curred.

Nick Bolkovac breaks his own
record every time he boots an extra
point. Automatic Nick now holds 41
out of 48 for an all-time Pitt record.

33’ BORIS WEINSTEIN

Pi Lam shut out Delta Sig Thurs-
day afternoon, 20-O, to move closer
to a playoff berth in the Sectionl
fraternity race.

The Pi Lams and Alpha Phi Al-
phas now remain the only teams in
Section I with a chance ofgathering
fifth place points toward the Greeks
interfraternity trophy.

By beating the Delts, the Lams
now possess a record of four wins

against three setbacks. The Alphas i

have a three and two record.

Paul Schutzman took over for in-
jured Dan Benjamin to spark the
victors in the 20-0 triumph. Schutz-
man rifled passes to Ierry Zeke!‘ and
End ArtLopatin for two touchdowns.

The other Lam score came in the
second half when Warren Shapiro
wrapped his arms around a Delt
pass and raced into the end zone.

The second half of Thursday’s
game was played under a greying
sky that hampered both team’s of-
fenses.

Army Harriers Whip Pitt
But Panthers Match Penn

After losing a triangular meet at
Philadelphia to a very good Army
cross countryteam,the Pitt harriers
face another close of the same medi-
cine this weekend. Notre Dame will
be the bitter pill for the Panther
cross country team to swallow on
Saturday morning at South Bend.

Army copped the meet last Satur-
day with 19 points. Pitt and Penn
finished in a tie for second place

honors with 59 points apiece.

Bob Pastorius was first to finish
for the Panthers, running the 4.4
mile course in 24:26 to finish fifth.

News’

According to Campus Poll

By LYNN V. HOOE JR.

Over 98 per cent of Pitt graduate
and undergraduate students read
the Pitt News, according to a sur-
vey taken last week by the members
of editing classes under the super-
vision of Robert X. Graham, head of
the journalism department.

The survey, taken from a cross-
section of students representing all
classes from freshmen to graduate
students,
schools conne cted with the Univer-
sity, also discloses that a large
majority of the Pittites like what

they read in their student publication.

Over three-fourths of the students
polled read the Pitt News editorials
regularly.

Campus activities prove to be the
most popular subject recommended
for editorials, with international
affairs and national and state poli-
tics and government following in
order.

The few suggestions for improve-
ment of the News that are offered
show that about 10 per cent of the
University students would like more
news about things in which they
have an individual interest.

For example, the students taking
engineering,education and business
administration would like more news

and all of the various

about their respective fields.
Other suggestions show

the activities of their organizations,
while a few readers think that.the
Greeks are already getting too much
coverage.

A small percentage of students
indicate that they would like more
sports coverage and humor. An in-
crease in pictures, features, and
number of pages are also suggested.

The most unique suggestion comes
from a student, probably thinking of
Pittsburgh’s current daily newspaper

strike, who thinks that the Pitt News
should be sold for five cents a copy.

Fryer, and Kathern Joyce are kept busy operating the city's larg~ 9%,

In the course of a day they are also
called upon many times to settle
arguments for people who think that
anyone associated with the Univer-
sity is intelligent enough to settle
major world sore spots.

lnfonnation Please

One person wanted to know how to
spell penicillin and another if camels
carried water in their humps. Ann
Loughrey, head operator, knew how
to spell penicillin and was able to
settle that argument. When asked if
camels carried water in their humps
she said “Yes,” but later found out
that they didn’t.

“We always give them an answer
if we know it or not, it’s the only
way to get rid of them” she said.

There are 670 telephones in the
buildings on campus and about 300
in the Cathedral. The switchboard
takes care of all outgoing and incom-
ing calls. It is estimated that there
are about 2300 calls in an 8 hour
period.

New System

Two years ago an automatic inter-
communication system was installed.

Before that the operators also
took care ofthese calls which added
to the difficulty. According to Mrs.
Loughrey this automatic system has
helped them a great deal.

Afterafootball victory the switch-
board is always busy with students
who want to know if there is any
school.

that each student will contribute at
least two dollars so that each agency
will receive two cents from each
student’s contribution.

AT DU PONT THEY FIGURE IMPORTANTLY IN MANY FIELDS

BECAUSE Du Pont is a chemical
company, you might expect most
of its technical men to be chemists.

Actually, there are more engineers
than chemists at Du Pont. In each of
the ten manufacturing departments
there is important work for men
trained in chemical, mechanical,
electrical, metallurgical and other
branches of engineering.

These departments operate much
as independent units with their own
research, development, production
and sales staffs. In their respective
ﬁelds, they do fundamental and ap-
plied research on both processes and
products. Sometimes engineers par-
ticipate in the early stages of a proj-
ect. More often, however, they enter
the picture when the project has
moved to the point where commer-
cial production is considered. They
see it through the pilot plant and
semi-works stages and assemble data

necessary for the full-scale plant.

Even after manufacturing has be-
gun, development work is continued
to standardize and improve the proc-
ess. Normally, engineers whose main
interest is production and plant op-
eration take over when the works
stage is reached.

Engineers on the technical sales
staffs help maintain Contact between
Du Pont and its customers. They
present data on new products and
guide customers in process develop-
ment and similar problems. They
also use their technical knowledge in
making surveys of possible markets
for the Company’s products.

In addition to the manufacturing
groups, the Du Pont Engineering
Department——a central staff organi-
zation——requires engineers with many
types of training. This Department
carries on its own program of funda-
mental and applied research. It also

at Du Pont. Through their teamwork
with chemists, physicists and other

pany produces its “Better Things for
