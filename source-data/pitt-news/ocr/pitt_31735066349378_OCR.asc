5 Extensive CIA Changes

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

The CIA should get out of the
business of political assassination
and should be revamped, former
CIA agent Sam Adams said in a
speech at Pitt yesterday.

Adams, the chief analyst of the
Viet Cong during the Vietnam War,
explained he repeatedly had been

"frustrated by the CIA bureaucracy

in his attempts to provide the
govefnment with honest informa-
tion.

‘‘I don't think we should abolish
the CIA,” Adams said to a small
crowd i-n the Student Union Lower
Lounge. “But some of the things

. that have come to light recently are

bound to be healthy in increasing

~ our effectiveness.”

Adams said there should be
more effective congressional over-
sight of CIA activities.

“The CIA also should encourage
more dissent than is allowed at
present. Specialists should be
encouraged to voice their opin-
ions,” Adams said. “Right now,
there's an overload in the upper
bureaucracy.

SGB Voter Turnout Lciuded

BY BILL MOORE

An unexpectedly high voter
turnout yesterday, the first day of
the second two-day Student Gov-
ernment. Board (SGB) presidential
election, has most observers
scratching their heads.

Because of confusion over
exactly when the new elections
would be and the apparent voter
apathy in the ﬁrst election, an
extremely low turnout was expect-
ed.

‘However, a total of 1,229 voters
cast their ballots yesterday, com-
pared to about 900 on the ﬁrst day
of the election held Jan. 21 and 22.

The two-day total for that election
” was 1,655.

The voting will end todaytat 7
p m ‘

Committee, (SGEC) chairman Lee
Moses, one of those predicting a
small vote, attributed the surprise
turnout to the publicity surround-
ing the election contest and appeal.

SGEC advisor Dave Tive theor-
ized differently. “It is possible the
people took a look at the ﬁrst
election,” Tive said, “saw how
close it was and realized their vote
did make a difference.”

‘Student Government Election

x

The top top vote-getters in the

first election-Joe Gronsky and_

Barry Weisband—were pleased
with the turnout. Both said it
probably was partially due to
publicity.

In the ﬁrst election, Gronsky
defeated Weisband by 32 votes,
but Weisband won his ﬁght to have
that election invalidated because of
problems with the voting mach-
ines. Slips of paper used to correct
the spelling of another candidate’s
name slipped in the machine and
obscured part of Weisband’s name.

Gronsky appealed the SGEC
decision toinvalidate his victory,
but that decision was upheld by the
Student Government Judicial
Board. ‘ _

The two other presidential
candidates—Larry Chaban and
Mark Satinoff—pulled consider-
ably fewer votes in the ﬁrst election
than Gronsky and Weisband. They
have compaigned minimally in the
new election, although they are still
on the ballot.

Yesterday’s voting was heaviest
in the Towers Lobby, with 568
votes cast compared to last
election’s two-day total of 715.
Gronsky won heavily in the Towers
in the first election.

Livewire: APO Holds Book Exchange Deadline 

BY GEORGENE KALEINA

Confusion has resulted from last week's complaints
about Alpha Phi Omega’s (APO) refusal to return money
and unsold books after the book exchange deadline.

During a meeting on Monday, APO voted to maintain its
stand in refusing to return the money and unsold books.

Legal Awareness member Gary Slagle said the receipts
students received in exchange for their books cannot be
used by APO as binding contracts. .

We have checked this out with Legal Awareness
lawyers,“ Slagle said. “I have discussed the possibilities of
a civil suit with the lawyers."

Slagle said class action in a civilucourt may cost a lot of
money and depending on the number of students involved,

it may not be worth it.

“However,.individual suits in the magistrate court would
be more feasible.’ Slagle said. “If the student wins, he

wouldn't pay anything because the loser is charged $10 V

__ plus. in this case. the value of the books.”

   

Slagle said Legal Awareness is willing to back the
students if they want to file charges. “We have to get
something concrete and find out exactly how many people
are involved before we can move on it.

At Monday’s meeting. APO President John DePaul said
that 98 people didn’t pick up their books or money. He said
since 42 students lived in the dorms and 23 lived in
Oakland. they should have been able to pick up their books.

Eight students have contacted Legal Awareness,

according to Slagle. “There is about $200 involved alone
with these students." —

_Slag_le. said.APO should return the money and books
since it is acting only as a go-between for the students.

“APO can be compared to a real estate agency which gets '

commission from selling property,” he said. “You never
hear of a real estate agency confiscating the property.”

Slagle said he called the national charter organization of
APO to see if something could be done through it as’ an

alternative to a legal suit. “I talked to the Executive

 

Director Robert Sherwood and he said he would talk to L .
DePaul,” he said. “Sherwood said he couldn't force them -—

to give the money and books back but he would talk'to

them."
DePaul said he thought APO would discuss it again at

Monday's meeting. “The brothers aren’t really aware what -

has been happening since the last meeting and we’ll
probably discuss it again." he said. “It’s unfortunate that

we only have a meeting once a week because of things like _ g 

thlsslagle proposed in the future APO expand the deadline
to five days instead of two and also draw up a binding
contract to protect itself in future book exchanges. APO
rejected the proposal. ' .
APO said keeping money and books in its offic
presented a security problem. Slagle offered to work to
obtain campus police protection for APO. ‘
The money and unsold books remain in the possession of

APO pending a final .resolution to the problem. DePaul 
said. ’ ” "

The Chancellor said he is

particular budget needs as a

;»Posvar said the University may
have to maintain this year’s hiring
freeze as part of the tighter
economy.- “Something like that
can be done on short notice, long
before a tuition hike would be
considered necessary.’ ’

The state provides roughly one

‘expenses, but only six percent of

the total expenses, Posvar said.

In the governor’s budget, how-

Posvar said.

The student aid appropriation of
$2.9 million has been the same
since 1974-75 and was the ﬁgure
originally requested by the Univer-
sity.

The 14 state-owned colleges,
including Indiana and Edinboro,
received an average six percent
increase. State Budget Secretary
Charles Mclntosh said there would
be no tuition increases

Ticket Update

The Chancellor’s ad hoc Com-
mittee on Ticket Distribution will
meet in a closed session today to
put its preliminary proposals on
paper, committee chairman Dr.

' Kenneth Metz said.

“We will be holding a work
session with just the committee
people,” Metz said. “There won’t
be any visiting people.”

Metz said the decisions made at
past meetings would be ﬁnalized at
today's meeting at 3 p.m. in 119
S.U. “A lot of discussion and
publicity has been‘ raised on the
assumption this is already ﬁnal-
ized, but we haven’t even put

anything down on paper."

He said he will solicitv ﬁnal
opinions from the committee on the
such as

payment for tickets and the
possibility of a refund system.

At a meeting Jan. 23, th
Committee approved a $1 charge
for student tickets at home football
games, with a 20% reduction for
season tickets.

The committee voted down
recommendations for a no-charge
system and for a full or partial
refund system.

The committee’s ﬁnal recom-
mendations will besubmitted to‘

GOVERNOR MILTON SHAPP

Provost for Financial Affairs David
Baldwin said.

“Like Pitt, we don’t have a
rock-hard strategy regarding tui-
tion increases. But also, like Pitt,
I’m sure it will be a last resort.”

The only major cutback in

Shapp’s budget was in money for

the private colleges’ and universi-
ties, which will receive $6 million,
half of this year’s aid.

Platt Says

BY BILL MOORE

Another tuition hike is likely in
light of Gov. Milton Shapp’s new
birdget recommendations, outgo-
ing Student Government Board

(SGB) President Larry Platt told the '

new Board Wednesday.

Platt listed the possible tuition
increase and faculty unionization as
the main issues on which the newly
elected student representatives
should concentrate. '

In his budget released Wednes-
day, the Governor recommended
an appropriations increase far short
of the 17.6% increase requested by
the University. (See story this
page).

‘‘That’s not a good sign,” Platt
said. “It is likely you will be faced
with a situation similar to the one
we were faced with last year at this

Former Agent Calls for

Extensive CIA Changes 

(Continued from Page 1)

“The CIA should deﬁnitely get
out of wild-man attempts, like
attempting to bump off Castro,” he
said.

Adams said the CIA’s involve-
ment in overturning foreign gov-
ernment is out of line. “In the long
run, we create more problems for
ourselves. Speaking as an intelli-
gence operative, I think it's a
foolish thing to do.”

Adams explained he was re-
sponsible for providing statistics
regarding the size‘ of the Viet Cong
army and the number of spies
entrenched in the South Vietnam-
ese government.

“I discovered" the size of the
army numbered around 600,000
men. The president (Lyndon
Johnson) and General (William)
Westmoreland manipulated the
ﬁgures and published tham at
270,00 men.” .

vealing that 30,000 Viet Cong spies

time.”

Platt advised the new Board to
utilize “stronger tactics” than his
Board used. “I think a strong
visual show of ‘support for holding
down tuition would work best,.” he
said.

He also told the Board to work
closely with community groups and
labor-‘ organizations in ﬁghting a
hike.

Faculty unionization will further
compound the problem for stu-
dents, Platt predicted. “The
University has to placate the
faculty, and one way to do that" is
give them a raise. Realistically,
with inflation, they deserve it.”

The faculty compensation in-
crease and the small state
allocation will put the University in
poor ﬁscal shape, he said. “It’s

PAT's Bus Fare Hike

Jn vokes Commuter Ire

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

Pitt commuters may have to pay
10 cents more each time they ride a
bus if the Port Authoritv Transit
(PAT) proposed-fare increase goes
into effect March 1 as planned.

The across-the-board fare hike is
aimed at balancing PAT’s $69.5
million budget. '

According to PAT’s proposal,
“U” tickets, student passes that
currently cost $7.50 apiece for 25

. ‘rides, will be increased to $10. A

V‘...

r

we:

new biweekly permit will replace
the current monthly and weekly
permits at a cost of $7. Free
transfers will still be available for
“U” ticket holders.

Commuter Association President
Larry Chaban said 54% of Pitt’s
commuters ride the buses and that
most of these use the “U” tickets.
Chaban said 60% of Pitt students
commute.

“I don’t know whether students
will stop riding the buses or not,”
Chaban said. “Most of them don’t
have any choice, because they can’t
drive to school because the parking
situation at the University is
dismal.”

“It looks as if it will cost more to
go to school because of higher
tuition, and it will cost commuters’
more just to get here,” Chaban
said.

PAT Planning Assistant William
J. Mattock said the rate hike
probably would lower ridership of
the bus system.

“Traditionally, for every five-
cent increase, we lose a certain
amount of riders, and in order to
increase revenue the bus system
has to keep its ridership,” Mattock
said.

The fare increase is enough to
offset a drop in ridership, he said.

Mattock explained PAT did not
state or
county aid it had requested in order
to avoid a rate increase. '

The PAT budget originally had
called for an increase of $1.2
million from Allegheny County and

DePaul photo

$4.6 million from the state over last
year’s aid. PAT will receive $18.3
million from the state, $7.4 million
in federal funds and $6 million in
county funds.

The fare increase _is expected to
generate an additional $4.2 million.

“PAT could not run on a deﬁcit,
and the money has to come from
someplace,” Mattock said.

PAT has scheduled open hear-
ings for next Friday at 10 a.m. and
7:30 p.m. in the Gold Room of the
Allegheny County Court House.
According to PAT officials, the
public will have an opportunity to
comment on the proposed fair hike
and to hear PAT’s rationale.

Other fare hikes include an
increase from $100 to $140 for an
annual permit and an increase from
$1 to $1.25 for PAT’s Big Buck
weekend fare.

The increase will affect all PAT
buses and trolleys, the PATrain
and the Mon Valley Commuter
line.

Transfers will still cost 10 cents,

and the Monongahela Incline and 4

downtowner zone price will remain
25 cents.

Children's Hospital Plans

$3.9 Million

BY LORI VALIGRA

Children's Hospital, part of the
University Health Center in Oak-
land. has proposed a $3.9 million
construction and renovation project
that would use hospital funds.

The proposal includes a three-
story addition, two operating
rooms, and renovation of the five
existing operating rooms, accord-
ing to Pitt’s Planning Director
Walter J. Rome.

“The University has no mone-
tary interest and no personnel
involved in the proposed addition
to Children's,” Pitt Comptroller
Paul Solyan said.

Rome said funds will come from
contributions made over the past
several years from the public and
from bequests. Money was saved
exclusively for building purposes,
he said.

“Since the money will come from
the hospital itself, the program is
very reasonable; hospital costs will
not be raised on its account,” Vice
Chancellor of the Health Profes-
sions Nathan Stark said.

The hospital will present its
proposal to the City Planning
Commission on Feb. 17, according
to reports published earlier this

week. Rome said he expects the

Death Fact for Living, Dying

BY MARILYN ZRUST

Greater concern with death
necessitates talking about how the
dying person faces it, Barbara
Shore of Pitt's Graduate School of
Social Work said Tuesday night in
the second of a six-lecture series at
Carnegie-Mellon University.

“In our extended families, dying
is not an unusual process," Shore
said. “Our youth-oriented society
hides away from being old. One can
go into adulthood without ever

experiencing death," she said.

Richard Schulz of C-MU's_
psychology department said med.-
ical personnel and family members
should be sensitive to the “stage”
of the dying person.

He referred to a studv identify-
ing five stages of dying—denial of
the illness—isolation, anger, bar-
gaining. depression and anticipa-
tion.

Three primary needs of the dying
can be seen and taken care of in a
set order. Shulz said.

“The control of pain is impor-
tant. The need for dignity is
followed closely by the need for
love and affection.

“The two main fears of those

. terminally ill is that of autonomy, a

sense of powerlessness and hope-
lessness, ‘ and of pain," Shulz
stressed.

The Union Showdown

With the armouncenient of balloting scheduled for March 9 and 10,
Pitt’s faculty unionization issue appears to be coming to an end after
two years.

While the three vying unions and the Teachers for an Independent I
Faculty try to make the best use of what little time they have to‘

influence faculty opinion, student involvement likewise should be
stepped up. ' I

Barring any improprieties at today’s Student Government election, ‘
‘ Tuesday will ﬁnd Pitt’s undergrads with a newly innaugurated Student

Government president and Board.
, Since it has scarcely a month before unionization comes up for vote,
the new Student Government Board must act swiftly and responsibly
on two equally important fronts: 1) What do the four factions have to
oﬂer and which will be the most beneﬁcial to students? and 2) what do
the students know about the issue and which faction would they
‘support? ,
Faculty unionization is too crucial and too complex an issue to be

I handled by only a few Board members; it deserves the full attention of

the entire Board, especially in light of the imminent vote.

What selling power the unionskhave in the coffers must be matched A

by the energetic legwork of a new Board. Otherwise, how is
case for the student position going to be made?

The Board must examine carefully not just what the unions promise,
but also what they realistically have achieved elsewhere, taking. into
consideration the effect the unions had on student bodies. After this is
done, Pitt students must be thoroughly informed through public.
forums and the mail on the likely prospects of the factions at Pitt.

students want the Board to go in actively supporting one of the four
faculty groups. Despite that students may be cool to a referendum after
the on-again, off-again Student Government election, a reliable test of
student opinion must be made to best utilize the power of a student

Such solid student backing very well could determine the course of
Pitt’s union situation, and for the Board or the student body to renege
on the opportunity to take advantage of a power swing at the University

 Lest we forget

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Although it’s chic these days
to look down on the CIA and the

' other tentacles of our intelligence

community, it's about time that
sensible people, looked up and
realized things for what they are.

First off, the CIA is one of the
biggest employers in the country,
right up there with I.T.&T. and
U.S. Steel. ‘Not only in this
country, but also throughout the
world, thousands upon thousands
of individuals depend on that check
from obscure Mexican coffee-trad-
ing companies to meet the electric
bill.

Many unemployed anarchists,
communists, Cubans and Russians
use this money to get through the
week, not to mention the millions of
upper- and middle-class members
using that extra income to get new
television sets and extra cars.
Many a harried housewife has the
CIA to thank for her new
dishwasher. -

The list goes on and on, and it
wouldn’t be folly to point out that
the CIA is the best mechanism for
economic redistribution yet de-
vised. Left-wingers should take a
toke on that one.

To cap this argument, the
coincidence of a worldwide econo-

;mic depression at the same time

Congressional pressure is being
levied against the CIA is just one
puzzle-piece too many. It's obvious
that what is good for this country is
good for business and vice versa.

Now more than ever it is painfully

‘obvious that the business of the "
United States

is the .CIA's
business.

Like the oft.-scorned space

project (another important "ideal"
_»._..,,‘_,g,on¢;-_to —d_ust _un,derﬁ the wheels‘ of E

liberal hysteria about living condi-
tions and ecology), the CIA has
provided us with many spinoff
products that enrich our lives.‘

Right now, Mommy can follow
her children wherever they go with '
the use of a compact all-electronic
surveillance device that ﬁts right
under Johnny's or Sue's. duode-
num. Mace-ﬁlled pens are putting
rapists back 2,000 years while
computer technology (boosted by
CIA experiments with massive files
on suspect citizens)_can ensure that
everyone pays his debts on
time...or else.

These are just a few. Because of
the CIA’s extensive involvement in
South America, bananas have
never been fresher, oil never more
plentiful and colorful dictatorships
never more amusing. The CIA has
provided psychologists with the
equipment and money to bore into
the human consciousness and make
it Republican. CIA satellites ﬁre
information about you and me

that'30f years ago would have been

Culturally the CIA has been the
major force behind many of our
favorite‘ expressions like “foreign-
leader nutralization” and “quasi-
political management.” The
paranoia ‘and fear‘ generated by
CIA inquiries have given rise to a
whole new sort of artistic expres-
sions and inspiration in New York
and elsewhere.

Never before have so many owed
so much to so few (whoever they
are). In conclusion, then, the wise
American can only shake his head
and wonder why, when so much
else has failed us, we choose now to’
pullthe carpet out from under such
a fine and important establish-
ment. .

Show your support any way you
know how. In your beds, in your
kitchens, in confessionals and
telephone booths, in your sweaty
office or in the gym’s shower room,
speak a word of praise for our CIA.
Don't worry—they’ll hear you.

After reading socialist literature
which was recently distributed in

say I am distressed at the
Socialists’ consistent approach to
problems; they always provide
short-term answers without looking
at the long-term implications of the
answers.

A case in point is their
advocaiionof cutting the defense
budget in favor of various

educational programs. I.must ask,

the Socialists to look at. the
long-term implications of such a
move. For is it not more important

Union Effectiveness

I will address here two issues
which have been raised by those
who would oppose unionization of
the Pitt faculty. The first has to do
with the‘ assertion that having a
union would lead to a bureaucracy
in university life and that, in turn,
would result in consolidating
wholly quantitative standards for
faculty development and the
evaluation of scholarship. The
second has to do with the argument
that unions in higher education do
not lead to the kind of empower-
ment that union advocates claim.

The ﬁrst argument claims that
unions impose an industrial model
on the nonindustrial community of
"scholars. Administrators become
“management,” faculty _ become
the “labor force”_and students are
viewed as “consumers.” The
difficulty with this charge about
what unionization would bring is

‘that it ignores what already has
happened in much of higher
education. It is simply ostrich-like
:0 overlook the fact that those who
exercise significant control in
university affairs presently (admin-
istrative ofﬁcers seeking formulae
for work load, trustees measuring
or seeking measures for productivi-
ty and legislators demanding
quantiﬁed data on numbers of
student-clients contacted and hours
expended in study and preparing
publications) have already adopted

A?"g;,=‘an industrial management model
" and have made it a fact of life at

Pitt and elsewhere.

It is laudable to seek a more
effective University Senate. But
the problem with the Senate
currently is not simply its potential-
ly unwieldy size or faculty apathy
toward it. The underlying issue is a
systemic one—the context within
which the Senate functions render-
ing it little more than an arena in
which faculty express opinions and
make some recommendations
which are subject to approval by

those already playing a managerial

role (administration, trustees and
government bodies). _

The second argument suggests
that unions are not an effective
force in higher education. Some
have pointed out that a strike of
university faculty would have none
of the force of a strike of public
school teachers. It may disrupt the
lives of students. But they might
simply transfer to a less trouble-
some institution. The strike in a
university would have none of the
effect of transferring the baby-sit-
ting function from teacher back to

parent as in the recent school strike

locally. Implicitly this argument
recognizes, by the way, that
students and their tax paying
families are clients who would ﬁrid
a university strike less troublesome
than a public school strike.

The weakness of this view is that
it fails to recognize that mechan-
isms other than the strike are
typically employed in collective
bargaining in higher education.
Recent experience in higher
education indicates that collective
bargaining functions more as a
means to consolidate the frequently
disparate opinions of faculty by
providing them with clearer infor-
mation both on financial and policy
questions so that their collective
mind is focused and their interests
cannot be ignored.

Of course, not all local unions’

contracts have been needlessly
complex or have resulted in
cumbersome processes. Some
negotiations have effectively re-
sulted in cumbersome processes.

Some negotiations have effectively
resulted in personnel policies that
place a premium on seniority at the
expense of scholarship as a
criterion of faculty development.

The contract in the state colleges in
Pennsylvania is an illustration of
both problems. But these
experiences do not deny the need
for greater weight being placed on

the faculty’s voice in university

affairs.

The notion that a university is to
be viewed as a community of
scholars is not to be denigrated.

The voice in the crowd is mean
and ugly; there’s a deep, throaty
and monotonous ring to it.

“Yeah and what about Starr?
Where the hell is he? Where’s old
Keith, that big all-pro. I wanna see
Keith Starr, man.”

Just behind the Pitt basketball
team’s bench, a heckler is at work.
At the end of the bench, the
injured, out-for-the-season Keith
Starr sits back, looks up at the giant
Civic Arena scoreboard and waits
for the start of the Pitt-Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania basketball
game—apparently oblivious to the
man in the stands. He wraps both
hands around his famous and
injured right knee and swings his
leg out and back.

The game is soon under way and
Starr is on his feet: “C’mon, get
that tip. Get it, get it, get it...AlI
right, let’s go!”

Just a few months ago, his future
was set—he’d have another out-
standing, perhaps All-American
season and then accept a lucrative
offer from some pro team. But his
injury has thrown a spanner in the
works, and—well, how can he
prove to the pros he’s recovered if
he never gets to play?

It’s not that he can’t play-the
coaches will let him and the trainer
will let him. But Starr, now in his
fourth season, knows he’ll be
eligible next year only if he doesn’t
play again this season. And if the

_ pros don’t make a good enough 7

offer, he can just come back to Pitt
again and show themhis stuff.

So, he might not get a good offer
because he doesn’t play, and he

. through the net.

“Where’s Old  Starr. ”

doesn’t play in case he doesn’t get
a good offer.
“YEAH! ‘YEAH! YEAH!”

Starr’s on his feet; his right fist is
raised. Pitt's winning, 16-13, and
some quick passes have just given’
Bob Shrewsbury, Starr’s room-
mate, an open shot. Shrewsbury
goes up-and Starr’s right hand
swings down as the ball sails
‘ ‘ Weeeeeee-o I ’ ’
he yells as he slaps the ﬂoor. His
forehead is wrinkled with delight,

and hes broken into a broad,

toothy grin.

He sits and bites off all that’s left
of his ﬁngernails—then he chews
at them some more. Another
basket for Pitt. Then another.
Everything’s going so well that

It was Nov. 17 and Pitt, with a
comfortable lead, had just stolen

the ball again and was setting up at

power play—a maneuver in which
the ball-handler puts his feet
together, stomps down and stops,
waits for any pursuers to ﬂy past
and then takes a clean shot.

Starr, an opponent breathing
down his back, stomped all right,

(and the defender was taken care of.

for Keith,’-’ Coach Tim Grgurich
said as Starr walked off the practice
court. .

“Feels like it’s sore today,” he
told another player. who was sitting

 the ball rack. He squatted at
courtside and bounced around on
his haunches.

“Maybe you better take it slow,”
the teammate said.

A pause. The bouncing stopped-

Starr thought for a second, then
turned. _

“Slow? Slow? It’s been 10
weeks, man,” he whined. “What
do you want me to do——go in
reverse?”

He rubbed the knee gingerly
with the tips of two ﬁngers. “You
can forget that.”

The teammate
quickly.

looked away

.._/7‘ _“Shit, why’s this fucker ‘sore

I "today, man?” he whispered to no
one in particular. He sat on the
rack and stuck his thumb into the
flesh around his knee, but his face
registered no reaction.

A moment later, Kip Smith, the
team’s young trainer, was at his
side. He told Starr why the knee
still hurt.

V “Is that what it is?” 4 His eyes
were raised and Smith nodded
silently. A Starr sighed. “I hope it
gets better soon. And I still don’t
understand—-it’s been 1(_) weeks.”

His voice was calmer and he
 spoke to himself. “God, my future
'§::lepends on this knee. I just wish

this motherfucker would make up
its mind.”

“C’MON, I WANNA SEE BIG,

. BAD KEITH STARR. Where the

2

hell is the all-pro, anyway? Let’s
bring him out. Havlicek’s waiting
for him.”

K He sounds like the Phantom of
the Opera. The other players are

bothered by it and glance furtively
at Starr, but none says anything.
And Starr—he doesn’t pay it much
attention. ‘

He leans forward on the bench.
He's been jumping up, kicking at
the ai-r, yelling at the officials and
kneeling on the floor more than the
other players. When he was an

active player, Starr never had‘

energy left for cheerleading. His
ﬁsts are pressed together, and the
backs of his thumbs are up against
his pursed lips. Penn, trailing by
eight less than a minute ago, has
pulled to within three points.
“Shit. Just once, just once I’d like
to blow somebody out...real good.
Like by 22, 23 points.”

BAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

The halftime horn—and the
players are pouring into the locker
room, grabbing for towels and
oranges. Eventually, Grgurich ar-
rives and they hush. As the heavy
metaldoor clangs shut, one of them
takes a quick inventory of his
teammates. “Where’s Keith?” he
asks. ‘

Starr is sitting on a table in one
of the maze of Civic Arena
corridors, and no one——not even
Grgurich—cares that he’s not in
the locker room. Kip Smith is next
to him. ~

“How is it tonight?” Smith asks
matter-of-factly.

“You saw me out there during
warm-ups. Didn’t I look fine to
you? Heck, I know I can play.

“Remember. . .did. you see that
one time we all went up for the ball
and came down together? I was
coming down with the good leg way
out here, and there was no way I
could get it back inibefore I landed.
I knew it was coming, but when I
hit, man, I didn't-feel a thing.”

A “humphh” from Smith.

“Then later I was driving hard
and it didn’t hurt at all. I tell you,
it's fine.’.’ '

It isn't a sharp pain that bothers
Starr. It’s a dull, deep pain, and it
doesn’t hurt just to walk, or

I sometimes even to play. But every

once in a while—when he cuts

around a defender or comes
crashing down with a rebound—his
knee reminds him he’s not the star
he used to be. -

“Chances are slim I'll be playing
again this year. If I do—that’s it,
that’s the end of my college career.
Of course, Pitt would like me to
stay, but I really think they want
what’s best for me. I’m gonna wait
to see what kind of offer I get from

the pros, so who knows? I might be
back at Pitt next year.

. “It doesn’t bother me to sit on
the bench anymore—-I still feel like
part of what’s going on. We live as
a team and die as a team. I’ll

admit—at first it really tore me
apart.” He bites his bottom lip,
closes his eyes, shakes his head
and grimaces. “But I’ve come to
accept it.

“ ‘The worst thing is that it had to
happen my senior year. I'll be one

A pause. “I don’t know—if I  
have to come back, I guess I’ll just ’ - 

take Jock 1 and ‘Jock 2.

“I don’t worry much about the

“I CAME TO SEE STARR--I 

wanna see that kid, damn it.
C’mon, give _us a look at the
all-pro.”

The team is huddled during a.
timeout; the game's practically
over, and Pitt has it in the bag.
Starr, as usual, is on the rim of the
huddle, barely paying attention.
He can’t help but look at the_
heckler, who’s more vociferous I
than ever.

The huddle breaks. Starr lingers _
on the court, and his teammate
Terry Knight wanders over.

“You hear that guy?" Knight
says. a
Starr is silent. He walks to the
bench and sits. Several players are
waiting. ' '

_ “Yeah,” he says slowly, break-
ing into a satisﬁed grin. ‘‘I wanna ~
hear this man talk some more shit.
I like to hear shit like that.”

After all, he thinks, they don’t
heckle everyone—just the stars.

Br MREA CSORBA

It’s a pleasure viewing a show

With no
weak spots to excuse or overlook,
the viewer can relax into pure
enjoyment of the show.

Such is the current Student
Photography Exhibition at Pitt’s
UP Gallery.

The studio arts department
screened the works of photography

‘ majors and other students for a
diverse yet solid show. All the
works are excellent, but the real lift
to this show comes /from the
welcomed exclusion of cliched
subjects.

There are no Hallmark deriva-
tives, no stale emotional appeals,

‘no doctored-up heaven-here-on-

earth landscapes and, thank God,
no photographs whose only point is
a beautiful nude body. ‘
‘There are simple shots of
peasant-bloused Hungarian women
(Martha Nyikos), a self-portrait

while shaving (Jeremy Nobel) and‘

the pricking print of a naked
women's back resting against .a
spiked cactus.

V Deviating from.the usual scene
scapes that loudly proclaim their

beauty is Richard Devlin’s night

reign through the satin blue night

Maintaining this quiet display of
beauty in the joint-effort slide show

with Rich Wilson, the Wilson-

low-toned peace and harmony.
Through, the springtime bloom of

the Cathedral lawn trees, shots of
spider branches of wintering oaks
and the lush hum of summer’s full

foliage, they encourage viewers to '

get over the enticement of exotic
scenes and take notice of overlook-

A Night at the Opera is the
English Quartet Queen’s most
recent attempt at showing its regal

 

roots, with its unique blend of fast,
heavy rockers and soft ballads.

It’s a formula that has worked
well. However, on A Night at the
Opera, there are too many excesses
and deficiencies, A resulting in
an uneven balance. - '

“The Prophet’s Song” is an

It predicts the destruction of the
Earth if the prophet’s warning is
heeded and 'moves from

BY CRIS. HALL

Coach Tim Grgurich and his 7-13
Panthers face a stern test tomorrow
night when the high-ﬂying Syra-
cuse Orangement (15-3) invade the
Field House in a game Pitt must
win if it is to ﬁnish the season on
the right side of .500. The tip-off is

scheduled for 8 p.m.

Though this is not the same
Syracuse team which ﬁnished
fourth in last year's NCAA
championships, the Orange are
quite a talented_ group. Led by 5-10
junior guard James “Bug” Wil-
liams, Coach Roy Danforth’s squad

~ is one quite capable of becoming

the ﬁrst Syracuse team to win at
Pitt since the 1967-68 Orange did
it, 85-71.

Syracuse has already claimed
one win over the Panthers this
season, taking the Steel
consolation game by 10, 90-80.
Senior captain Chris Sease, a 6-5
forward, led the way for the Orange

Bowl V

in that one, picking up 24 points
while snatching seven rebounds.
Williams, a slick guard whom
Coach Danforth calls “One of the
quickest players in the country,”
scored 20 against Pitt and his 16
points per game leads Syracuse.
Freshman Dale Shacklefor_d, a
6-6 forward had 10 rebounds
against the Panthers in his first
game as a starter and‘ has since
come on to average 13 points and
8.6 rebounds per game. Six-ﬁve
sophomore Marty Byrnes’ contri-
butions thus far have been 12
points and 7.4 rebounds, while
Sease has -been scoring at a 15
points per gameclip and grabbing
7.6 errant shots per contest.
Rounding out the starting ﬁve is
6-2 guard Ross Kindel, a sopho-
more who has; along with
Shackleford, helped the Orange
win 12’ or the 13 games Syracuse
has played since that ‘pair was
inserted into the lineup. Kindel
leads Syracuse in assists with 64.

There was one bright spot in the
Panthers 89-77 loss Wednesday to
the 18th-ranked University of
Cincinnati Bearcats‘? The Cats were
outscored by only two points from
the charity stripe, compared to
their 19-game average of eight
points. . _

_ This is not to‘ say the Panthers
weren't hurt by fouls. "

_ Within the ﬁrst four minutes of
play, the’ Panthers collected.six
personal fouls. They continued,
‘garnering 31 personals for the

' game, and along with Cincy’s, the

referees justiﬁeda grand total of 60
fouls. Is this major-college basket-

This is the youngest team that

The lack of experience that
plagued the Panthers early in the
season is no longer the major
liability it once was. Senior Bob
Shrewsbury has stepped into the
starting lineup and provided the‘
leadership the Panther offense so
badly lacked. .

Larry Harris continues to make
thebest of a bad season, as his 22.9
per.-game average indicates. Join-
ing Harris in Pitt’s probable
starting lineup are Willie Kelly and
Wayne Williams underneath. Scott
Nedrow will join Shrewsbury in the
backcourt.

Senior Tom Richards will divide
time with Shrewsbury at point
guard. Though still not 100%
physically, Richards will be a
welcome addition to the Panthers
lineup, especially if, as one coach
predicts, his old shooting touch is
on the brink of returning.

“Syracuse likes to run," says
Panther Assistant Coach Fran
Webster. “In our earlier game with
them, they used the fast break to
their advantage.”

“We'll have to stop them from
running, and if we stay with them
on the boards, we’ll give them a
much rougher time than we did last
time." ' .

',“It should be ‘a great game,"
Webster went on, _“Syracuse is a
good ball club, but I think we’ll

of one of those early-afternoon
game shows? '

To be precise, the fouls hurt the
Pantherssufﬁciently. Larry Harris,
the heart and soul of the Panther
offense, sat out a full seven
mi_nutes of the first half, as did
Willie Kelly.

At the 10-minute mark of the
ﬁrst half, with the‘ score 18-17 in
favor of Pitt, a layup by Harris was
disallowed when he picked up his
third personal. He was replaced by
Frank Boyd.

The teams traded baskets, until

Willie .Kelly recorded his third-.

personal and was replaced by
Ralph McClelland. Tom Richards
hit a couple of free throws,
McClelland hit a short jumper and
the Panthers had a 26-23 lead.
Cincinnati, determined not to»

have its 44—game home win streak s

broken _ by a 7-12 team, took
advantage of Harris’ and Kelly’s
absence. The Bearcats outscored
Pitt, 13-3, to take a commanding
seven-point lead, 36-29, with_ less
than three minutes remaining in
the first half.

In sheer desperation, Harris and
Kelly returned. The move helped
slightly; Kelly dumped in a shot,

closing the gap to ‘ﬁve. After a
Bearcat ﬁeld goal, Harris came up

V with the third Panther three-point

play of the period to narrow the
lead to four, 38-34.

Cincy added two more points at
the buzzer.

The ever-ferocious‘ Pitt amoeba
defense limited the Bearcats to a
horrendous 27% ﬁeld~goal average
in the first half, but after Scott
Nedrow opened the second-period
scoring with a free throw,
Cincinnati came alive, rattling off a
12-2 spurt that put the Cats out to
lunch, 52-37. _

Not to be counted out, Pitt closed.

the _gap to seven with a jumper by‘

Richards, but the foul-funny
officials gave the game to Cincy by
handing Harris his fourth person-

After that, Harris couldn’t hit
those jumper/s that usually have his
name all over them,
Bearcats took advantage of the
situation by building an 18-point
lead.

Words Can’t Describe
I Ailing Grapplers

BY J_iM LEWIS

It's impossible to explain the
importance of the Pitt wrestling.
team’s‘ ﬁnal home meet of the

_ season when it hosts Lock Haven

tomorrow at 2 p.m. _' .

Both teams have only, one loss in
the tough Eastern Wrestling
League, and along with Clarion are
tied for second place with identical
2-1 _ records in their conference,
‘behind Penn State. A loss will

‘knock either Lock Haven or the

Patnhers out of the race for good.
So you see, a win in tomorrow’s
‘meet is so, so vital. '

But will it be close?

“Lock Haven has a pretty nice,
balanced litieup,” ‘Head Coach
Dave Adams said. “I look for a
good tight match.”

-Looking for a good, tight match
seems a little ridiculous after the
32-15 trouncing Clarion gave the
Panthers on Tuesday. But impor-
tant meets like this one have the
unusual ‘characteristic of being
very, very close.

Especially after you examine the
bright. spots creeping into Pitt’s
present preparation.

“We had a real good practice,”
"Adams claimed. ‘.‘Tl‘ie guys were a
little’ embarrassed after the Clarion
meet. We had a lot of mistakes and
have been trying to make up for it
in practice.” V

Yes, good fortune has fallen on
the Panthers recently. True,
they've lost their last two meets on
home ground to bring their record
to 10-3, but the injuries and empty
Field House seats plaguing Pitt in
the past are beginning to change
for the better. ’

'As far as injuries are concerned,
Skip Bolin has been lost for the
season because‘ of appendicitis.
Two-time All-American Rande
Stottlemyer, out for the past three
meets with a back injury, is a
possible starter, while Ray Dalla-
tore and Milt Schuler, whoghav

been out for the past two meets;xi—°;"

are questionable. Their ﬁtness for
the team will be assessed on a
day-to-day basis.

The crowds have gotten well,
too. Before the Millersville ‘State
meet, home crowds averaged an
astronomical 400. On Tuesday,
however,an estimated 2,000 enthu-
siastic fans came to the Field
House. And because of the
importance of tomorrow’s meet,
the same should be expected
against Lock Haven (13-1).

“We’d-like to see a nice crowd,”
Adams said. “The closer the

.44

match, the more important the .

_crowd.’' .

If that's the case,
tomorrow's crowd will be vital.

‘they:

both the medley and the freestyle

relays.

MSU Relays An Experience

BY RALPH SPARKLE

The Pitt track team will head
west for the Michigan State Relays
tomorrow. Considered one of the
best meets in.the Midwest, the
relays draw talented competitors
from near and far.

The Big Ten schools and other
track powers such as Kent State,
Air Forceiand Tennessee produce
the atmosphere that leads to'NCAA
qualifying marks and broken
records. ‘

“We are going to the relays to
gain experience and let the
younger team members build” up
-their conﬁdencef’ Head Coach

 

 

competition is keen, but I feel-we
have good shots at winning quite, a
few events.

“If everyone follows our basic
philosophy of 100% effort, they are
sure to show improvement.”

Pitt’s strong events will be the
mile and distance medley relays.
The mile relay with the combina-
tion of Willie Walker, Don Betterly,“
Keith‘Leckenby ‘and Karl Farmer
will give any opponent a tough
race. I ‘

Cats Seek Vengeance panumeueswin, 105.

 For Previous Losses

BY STEVE SYBBRT

The Pitt Hockey Club has some
repaying to do. The University of
Cincinnati Bearcats will be in town
7 p.m. Saturday at the Sewickley
Arena where the team that
squished the Panthers, 12-5, three
weeks ago then squashed them,
12-3, the next day, will try to wallop
the Panthers again.

But the Cats aren't going to be so
playful this time.

V/‘S?--“We’ll be ready for them—we_

won’t be ambushed,” said Coach
Len Barcalow. “Our guys don’t
run around and look for pity after
we get hammered by somebody.”

This time around, the Panthers
will employ their not-so-secret

' weapon—Rick Vernon, the team’s

leader and top scorer.‘ Vernon
missed the ﬁrst two games in
Cincinnati, but whether his pres-
ence in the lineup will matter has
yetto be seen. His hat trick against
Ohio University last week proved to
be the key to Pitt’s 5-3 victory.
Cincinnati is a more physical
team than Ohio. Because the
Bearcats raised their sticks and
elbows the last time they faced the

/_..-—~Banthers, Barcalow refers to them
‘V as “those guys from the lumber-

/“'““"I

)l‘_,'.'.*>:’

x‘. '

yard down in Cincy.” a

“They are a ‘good skating team
and you can expect the same from
our guys,” Barcalow said. “But
there won’t be as much lumber and
elbows being thrown around here
like in Cincinnati.”

With scorers like Vernon, Curt
Hetz, and Scott Kimmick leading
the way, the Panthers have a lot of
dangerous shooters, but the
defense has been lacking some-
what in several of the games. Only
Russ Stump and Vernon, when he’s

. not'on a scoring rush, have been

playing consistently on the back-
line.

But Barcalow has high hopes for
his team especially with the likes of
Navy and Penn State approaching.

“If our club can play the type of
hockey that we played in New York
and’ against Ohio,” he said, “I
don’t see how our season can be
anything less than a success.”

One thing inhibiting Pitt is the
lack of practice. Due to decreasing
funds, the Panthers are unable to
book any sessions at the Civic
Arena, relying mostly on workouts
held at North Park where Barcalow
works. But the Hockey Club is
doing okay even with little or no
practice.

“The Ohio University coach
couldn’t believe our last practice
was the Tuesday before the
game,” Assistant Coach Bob
Montgomery said, “especially with

a. school as big as Pitt.” ‘

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

‘ The Pantherette basketball team
massacred the Duquesne Duchess-
es Wednesday night, 105-35. Led
by 6-5 center Terry Vogt, who
scored 17 of her game-high 21
points in the ﬁrst half, Pitt swept
by the hapless Duchesses for a
53-22 lead at the break.
Pantherette Coach Pat. Wallace
started the game with an all-new
lineup (minus such familiar names
as Debbie Jones,_Kim Raymond
and Barb Welsh, none of whom
was suited up) and made no
substitutions at all in the ﬁrst half.
Pitt played an entirely different
game than usual; with guard Cindy
DiGiacomo quarterbacking the
proliﬁc offense, the Pantherettes
emphasized ﬂashy showmanship
without letting up on the defense
for a second. So the effect of Diane
Zaken’s reverse lay-up was not
obscured by a Duquesne blitz at the
other end of the court. ’
The defense was even tighter in
the second half, when Pitt allowed

    

*-. in V n
.. 4 n 1 .'“'A' - .\‘n, ,.

..'... .g.

the Duchesses a grand total of 13
points. , ‘

The second scoring found the
Pantherettes with five players in
the double figures column: DiGia-
como, second only to Vogt, tallied
20; Zaken and Jan Conway each
totalled .14, and Joan Maser added
10.

Vogt grabbed 13 rebounds to top
that category, and Zaken pulled
down nine. DiGiacomo had three
assists.

So, with lackluster Duquesne
down the drain, Pitt will be facing
its toughest competition of the
season Sunday afternoon when
they take on Federal City.

Federal City’s 5-3 record is
deceptive. Before the season, it
was rated ﬁrst in the country. Need
more proof of the seriousness of
this competition?

On of those losses came at the
hands of Immaculata -the team to
beat in Women’s basketball circles.
Much more impressive than a loss
to’ Edinboro, to say the least.

Keith Taylor will be aiming for‘

Nick Martin proved his talents

Farmer, Pitt’s next Olympic ‘

prospect, will compete in his first

Agostinella feels Farmer is ready

the season, where he hopes Farmer ,

will peak. —
