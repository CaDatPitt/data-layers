School of Medicine Charged

With Racial Discrimination

(See editorial, “A. Challenging Task,” Page 2)

. The University’s Medical School has been charged with racial discrimination by
the National Association for the Advanéem ent of Colored People (NAACP). The charge
was made in a letter sent to Robert Nash, national director of the U.S. Office of Equal .
Health Opportunity,‘ signed by Dr. Charles E. Greenlee, chairman of the NAACP Med-
ical Committee, and Byrd R. Brown, president of the NAACP’s Pittsburgh branch.

West Side Cookies

by ROBERT HOROWITZ

Restless kidssitting on a
fence. Snap! Snap! The cool
beat of snapping fingers.
Dancing, running‘, spinning,
pushing, leaping, and fight-
ing across the stage. Who’s
the coolest set, Shark or
Jet. ‘

Once again the beautiful
catchy music of West Side Story
creates the scene for this con-
temporary Romeo and Juliet.
Arthur Laurents’ book and
Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics set to
the strands of Leonard Bern-
stein’s music has become the
Our Town of musical comedy.
West Side Story, like Our Town,
has been performed too many

‘ times; its music has been play-

ed too often; and its romantic
view of juvenile delinquency has

, been over done. If you eat too

many cookies you soon develop
a. dislike for them. The same

- goes for a show seen too often,

its very name grates against
your mind like new chalk
scratched on a black board.
The Civic Light Opera pro-
duction this weekjust barely
survives the problems of over-
exposure. Good performances,
a decent set, and some brilliant
choreography "help in clearing
the picture of the problems
faced by juvenile gangs in their
attempt to get a hold of some-

thing secure--—even if it's just a.

hunk of cement side-walk in
Manhattan. Shakespeare’s famed
.lo\.-'e story has been the model

\

 

   

for the S author, lyricist, and,
composer. The Montague’s are
portrayed by the ﬁrst genera-
tion “natives” who claim that
the Capulets, immigrant Puerto
Ricans, are trying to take over
their territory. Amidst the hatred

and ﬁghting two people from.

the opposing factions ﬁnd that
harmony can exist between their
groups. It -is through the efforts
of these lovers that the mem-
lsers of the gangs learn to see
each other in their true light.

In terms of acting, four per-
formances stand out from all
the others-. Anna Maria Alber-
ghetti’s portrayal of Maria is
sincere and beautiful. She works
well with David Iiolliday who
catches the spirit of Tony, a
man torn between two worlds.
Their balcony scene where they
confess their love to each other
is done very well. Carolyn Mor-
1-is is perfect in the role of the
wild, sexy, freedom-loving Anita.
The most outstanding acting
role, however, is that of Carmine
Terra in his portrayal of the
ethnically orientated‘ Bernardo,
Maria's brother and leader of
the Sharks.

Dancing plays an important
role in any production of West
Side Story. Carolyn Dyer as
Anybody’s leads the array of
fine hoofers which also includes
the forementioned ﬁne actors.
The singing is lead by Miss Al-
bergetti and Mr. Holliday. To be
honest, I was quite surprised at
the ability of Holliday in han-

(‘ling the difficult songs Tony

must sing. Miss Al‘berghetti’s
ﬁne voice came across beauti-

’ fully in such numbers as I Feel

Pretty, Somewhere," and To-
night. The dancing and singing
hit a high point in the Dance at
the Gym and The Somewhere
numbers.

Added by an -interesting set-
and an attentive ‘audience, last
night’s production was perform-
ed well. Unfortunately some-
thing was amiss. Despite the
ﬁne job done, I felt disappointed.
Even though they looked good,
I've had too many cookies too
often to enjoy them fully.

who are considered a risk accep-
tances,” Rosborough pointed out.

Rosborough emphasized that
his responsibility is to perform
a “general counseling. service.”

“My dealings with the ath-
letes,” stated Rosborough, “will
strictly be academic.” He also
stated that his role as a counse-
lor does not include the assign-
ment of courses. “I will merely
suggest courses for the ath-
letes,” said Rosborough.

“My underlying purpose or re-
sponsibility in this new posi-
tion,” said Rosborough, “is to
prepare the student for know-
ing himself. This preparation,
however, will in no way distract
the self-deliberation of the stu-
dent," he pointed -out.

Rosborough agreed that there
was a deﬁnite need for a posi-
tion such as his. “Many students
come to the University with a
great concern for their academ-
ic future. The athlete and the
‘risk student’ could certainly
proﬁt from a general counseling
service.”

‘Time’ Article Notes
‘News’ Advertisement

Time magazine -spotlighted a
recent Pitt News ad in last
week's “U. ‘S. Business” section.
The ad, which read, “You might
be 1-A, but you’re A-1 with us,”
was run by Armstrong Cork in
an attempt to recruit 1967 Uni-
versity graduates for work in
their company.

Time stated that “the pitch at
Pitt was pretty much the cor-
porate address of 1967.” Due to
an acute’ need for manpower,
companies all over the country
are tracking down graduates
with increased fervor, plying
them with more money than

ever before. The College Place ‘

ment Council claims that this
has been “the toughest, most
c om pe t i tiv e college-recruiting
year in history.”

  

The two main factors respon-
sible for the dwindling supply

' of available graduates are the

increased dra-ft demands and the
number of students who are go-
ing on for graduate degrees.
Several companies are hiring
men who are only weeks away
from draft calls in hopes that
they will return to work for

- them in two years.

As the demand increases, the
salaries offered go up. Last

year’s crop of chemical engi-'

neers commanded a $682 a
-month starting salary. This year
they are receiving $733 a month.
Math and physics students are
now getting $698, compared to
last year's $648, and the human-
ities students’ salaries have risen
from $547 to $589.

cal professions. _

  

The letter, which Was dated
July 11 a.nd made -public July
13, urged immediate investiga-
tion into the University's poli-
cies of accepting Negro students
in.to medical school and of hiring

Negro faculty. The NAACP ‘

maintains that the University
“has matriculated and graduated
almost a zero percentage of Ne-
gro -students and is making no
apparent effort to improve upon
its record.”

The following point was made:
“It should be noted in this con-
nection that it was not until the
1940’s that the ﬁrst Negro was
admitted and graduated from
the University of Pittsburgh
School of Medicine. This is one
of the prime factors which has
caused a scarcity of physicians
practicing medicine in predom-
inantly Negro neighborhoods.”
The letter also claimed that t-he
Medical School has never had a
full-time Negro faculty mem-
ber.‘ C

Brown, one of the co-signers
of the letter, told The Pitt News
that the University is not the
only school being investigated
in Pittsburgh, but said that this
instance is “one of the most

ﬂagrant” examples‘ or discrim- ‘

ination. Since the University's
Medical School receives funds
from the Federal Government,
the case was referred to the US.
Office of Equal Health Oppor-
tunity in Washington, D. C.'If
the charges made against the
University are found to be true,
then some of the federal funds
may be withdrawn, Brown
stated, ‘

A statement denying the
charges was released Friday by
Joseph G. Colangelo, director of
University News Publications.

Representing the University,

Colangelo explained the situa-
tion, citing Medical School ﬁg-
ures as illustrations. Between
1957-1967 only 21 “-known” Ne-
-gro student-s applied to the Med-
ical School. (The exact number
of Negro -applicants has not
been recorded since the Fair
Educational Employment Prac-
tices Act became law in 1967.)
Of the 21 who applied, ten were

admitted and one went e1se- ,

where. Therefore, 50 per cent of
the Negroes applicants were ac-
cepted.

The Negro student often has
an unequal and poor -academic
career, Colangelo continued and
receives a poor grade school and
high school education.- To coun-
teract this, there are two poli-
cies which have been adopted by
the University. One of the Med-
ical School's policies is that of
“compensatory admissions,” in
which special consideration is
given to Negro applicants. The
other is a recruiting policy in
which members of the Medical’
School staff visit local Negro
high schools to lecture and try
to interest students in the medi-

  A Challenging Task

The charge of racial discrimination lodged against the University’s

’ School of Medicine by the local chapter of the NAACP is one that merits

‘complete investigation by the proper authorities.
As the letter sent to‘ the U.S. Office of Equal Health Opportunity
by Dr. Charles E. Greenlee and Byrd Brown stated, “It was not until the

- 1940's that the first Negro was admitted and graduated from the Uni-
'”versity’s School of Medicine. This is one of the prime factors which has

caused a scarcity of physicians practicing medicine in predominantly

- , Negro neighborhoods.” .

Since we do not have access to the exact number of Negro appli-
cants accepted in proportion to those who apply, we are not in a position
to either confirm or deny the NAACP charges. But we must state that

E if all the remarks uttered by University officials about our responsibility

to the City of Pittsburgh are any guideline, it is definitely our responsi-
bility totry to remedy these educational inequalities which have such

‘J far-reaching and devastating results for the predominantly Negro neigh-

borhoods in this area.
The problem goes deeper than the School of Medicine, however.
As Joseph Colangelo, the University’s director of News and Publications,

I» pointed out, the scarcity of Negro applicants and students at our School

of Medicine stems from “a poor grade school and high school education.
The Negro student often gets an unequal and poor academic career, and

_i by the time he is in medical school, he is frequently unprepared.”

   

constitute a small percentage of our total enrollment. A Descriptive and
Comparative Study prepared by the Office of Institutional Research on
the entering freshman class of the 1966 Fall Term revealed the follow-
ing: 95 per cent of the entering freshmen identified their race aswhite;
ﬁve per cent identiﬁed themselves as Negroes, orientals, etc.

Some effective attempts are being made to attract Negroes, how-
ever, such as the School of Liberal Arts’ program for Negro students
who are borderline cases. These students are accepted by the University
and given special counselling during their stay.

A new program being launched in cooperation with the Pitts-
burgh schools will attempt to remedy the problem of too few Negro
teachers. The high school counselors will identify the students to be
given special counselling, and they will be trained to help fill this gap.

Obviously these programs affect only a limited number of stu-
dents, but they are steps in the right direction. What is needed is a
more massive approach to deal with the severe inequalities that exist
for the Negro from birth. We urge the University to do its share in the
ﬁght to improve the plight of the Negro. Its current efforts make only
a small dent in solving the problem at hand. or

The discrimination charge against the School of Medicine should
not be refuted and forgotten. Rather, the entire University should take
on the challenge of remedying the inequalities that exist not only for the
benefit of the Negro, but for the benefit of our entire community as well.

  

Even among the University’s undergraduate population, Negroes

‘THE SHORTAGE of dormi-
tory space at our University

and the p_atsong_l_- desire of many
'Universit;€-"Students to exercise

their option to live off-campus

I has created a situation that can-

not be resolved using the avail-
able means.

The thorough investigation of
apartments and rooms for stu-
dents in the Oakland area by
the Student Government Off-
Campus Housing Committee has
revealed that the plight of the,
off-campus student can only be
resolved satisfactorily by build-
mg University-"owned apart-
ment buildings in the Oakland
area.

, It is true that the committee
obtained a great number of
housing‘ listings through a sur-
vey which covered selected areas
of Oakland. However, the re-

. sults do not negate the fact that

there are still landlords who re-
fuse to rent to students, that
there are still landlords, who dis-

criminate, that there are still

acceptability and comfort, that

the average rent in Oakland is
still fantastically high relative

to students’ resources and that

the vacancy rate in Pittsburgh
is the second lowest in the Unit-
ed States.

THE SITUATION in which
the committee now finds itself
may be described? as _follows:
1. Landlords will not, in most
cases, lower their rents, im-
prove the conditions of their
dwellings to any significant ex-
tent, cease to discriminate (t-hose
who do discriminate), or be
forced, through competition to

‘offer any particular privileges

to students. The reason is due to
supply and demand which makes
such changes ﬁnancially un-
wise. There have been some in-
stances when landlords have
renovated apartments but the
price of the improved dwellings
guarantee even greater profits
than before. 2. The Off-Campus
Housing Committee cannot ini-
tiate any decisive action on its
own to greatly alter the housing
situation.

Given the above circumstances,
University-owned apartment
buildings represent the only so-
lution to a problem which grows

Thus, the function of this
committee. will be the same as
that of any student organization
with a limited capability. It
must investigate a given prob-
lem, maximize within the pre-
sent conditions, and seek action
from the University to alter
those conditions for the future.

FURTHER, THE committee
will engage in an extensive pro-
-gram to examine possible courses
of action which the University
might undertake to alleviate the
c-if-campus housing dilemma.

Measures have been taken to
deal with the off-cam-pus hous-
-ing problem by other universi-

ties. These plans are now being"

considered by the committee to
determine their applicability in
Oakland.

Of the plans, the most feasi-
ole seems to ‘be one in which a
university arranged for a con-
tractor to buy land near the
school and build apartment
buildings on the site. The school
made payments on the building
until, after a ten-year period, it
owned the apartments. During
this time, the builder -was re-
ceiving proﬁts at a price, with-
in the income of students, agreed
upon by the school and the con-
tractor.

AT THE moment, the com-
mittee is only in the initial
stages of its program, For a
proposal such as -the one just
mentioned to be received with.
any degree of optimism by the
administration and students,
many details must be discussed
and researched and every alter-
native must be examined. Never-
theless, -the signiﬁcant point is
that action is being taken on the
problem.

Letters to

Participant Rips
LAS Article

Editor, The Pitt News:

Illlllllllllllllllll i

I have been -insulted by the

outrageous misquoting done in
your article in the July 11, 1967,
paper: “Unconventional Course

Stirs Student Interest in Latin-

America.” Your false statements
have caused difficulties in my
relations with the professors in
the program. .

The incompetent fool who cov
ered this group interview was
obviously incapable of meeting

' the demands required of him.
First, the reporter could not
possibly have quoted directly
from the students. We were
speaking too quickly for him
to get the exact wording which,
by his use of quotes, he claims
to have done. Second, many of
the students were making the
same or similar -statements. The
author took it upon himself to
determine who said What. He
took -similar sentiments and
grouped them under one arbi-
tarily chosen student's name.
Third, and most important, he
has attributed statements to me
which I did not utter. In fact, it
was I who made statements that
were the complete antithesis of
those printed. I -said nothing
about professors arguing. It was
I who said “we -are above per-
sonality conﬂicts.”

Because your article was not
only libelous but also has caused
me great anxiety and a loss of
respect in the eyes of my fellow
students and above all my teach-
ers, I demand that you print an
apology and correction of that
article as well as an apologetic
letter to the Latin - American
Program.

Editor’s Note: We extend our
apologies for any unfortunate in-
cidents that have occurred be-
cause of any alleged misrepre-
sentation. If anyone -was mis-
quoted, it was not done deliber-
ately. Our sole objective was to
give well deserved press coverage
to the Latin American Studies
proglram, and we lament that any

venienced. in the process.

let me try taking a few potshots
at the God-coaches of the Uni-

Has anyone heard of them

Does anyone really know how
many of them are on the vari-

Now, before those students
who know that there ‘really is

being known to some segments
of the University population-
are the rare -birds of an ordi-
narily Ivory Tower type. For
the most part, our chaplains are
invisible when, or rather if they
wander on campus by mist-ake.

When was the last time the
Chaplains Dilg, Gibson, Biegart,
Hagopian, Unger, Gardner,
Swenson, Rindlaub, Kennedy,
Walsh, Clancy, Flock, et. al.
spoke to you, or wrote to you, or
spoke even to the University-in-
general?

When was the last time a
chaplain appeared at a student
organization to offer aid or seek
it? "

' I think it is tragically waste-
ful to have so many men sup-
posedly working as campus

chaplains on at least a part-.

time basis, and yet ‘have such
little contact with the students,
especially in an informal atmos-
phere. What I would like to see
is a “chap1ain’s booth” in the
far side of the Tuck Shop, where
we could meet with them on our

terms, rather than in the dingy I

office in Schenley Hall.

We have a new Chancellor
and everyone is trying to create
a good impression for him, try-

. ing to convince him that Pitt is

a truly Great University. If it
is, then let me suggest to the
chaplains that truly Great Uni-
versities very frequently have
truly Great Theological Schools
and Very Impressive and Active
Chaplains. Now Pitt’s affiliation
with Pittsburgh Theological
Seminary is a good step to-
ward the ﬁrst condition, but
when do we get chaplains who
are concerned? .
