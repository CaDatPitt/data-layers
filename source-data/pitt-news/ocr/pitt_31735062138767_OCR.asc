It Can Be

Owl Editors Prove

Done!

u “Everyone believed a 1944 Owl was impossible,” said Theodore W.
Biddle, dean of men, at Tap Day services Friday, May 5.
But even while other college annuals have folded up right and left,

the Owl has gone to press as usual,

and the staff has worked night and

a day, week-ends and all to get it there.

N This year (so the staﬁ tells us) the Owl will be bigger and better
than ever and will rank as one of the best year books Pitt has ever had.
More ﬁelds will be covered than ever before, including the Service Hall

‘of Fame, informal shots of the Den-
tal School, pictures of each com-
pany and squadron that has been

V stationed at Pitt, and two full pages

of every fraternity on campus. The
‘cover will be leather with the gold
seal of the University on it, and

 there will be 340 pages in all. Sub-

scriptions had to be limited to 1400

this year because of the paper
“ shortage.

At the last minute, shots of the
Spring Festival activities were add-
ed. Concerning this the business
manager, Roger Wood, C, said,
“We know the students would want
a well represented Owl this year.”

The Owl‘ may be ready for dis-
trilfution bythe week of May 26
in the Owl office. However, there
is a possibility that, because of a
man. power shortage, the printers
will be unable to get them out in
time. Any students, therefore, who
plan to be out of town after the 26th
should leave their 25 cents mailing
money in the Owl office this week.

Plans for next year’s Owl are
rather vague because of the paper
shortage and the lack of photog-

' raphy supplies which were par-

gart,

Pitt’s Done
This Year

This has been an especially busy
year for Pitt students and faculty.
The war, of course, made necessary
many campus adjustments’; but be-
fore we “close up shop” until next
fall, let’s follow a resume of the
year.

September 24——No‘ classes this

men were bewildered enough with
registration. Except that it was the
ﬁrst game of the year, nothing"more
need be said for the Pitt-Notre

“In the spring a young man’s
fancy lightly turns to—--——” was the
theme of the women’s frats sta-
tionary ﬂoat exhibit took place on
the Cathedral lawn last Friday
afternoon’ during .Pitt’s Spring
Festival. Going all out for the
event were eleven w'omen’s fra-
ternities. “It was the largest par-
ticipation in any like event in the
history of Spring Festival” said
Serretta Miller. C, chairman.

The judges, 1)r. George W.
Crouch, Dr. Ford  Curtis and
Dr. Theodore Finney said, “All the
ﬂoats~were of. such high standing
that it made it exceedingly diﬂicult
to choose any particular ones as
best."

Highest honors wont to TPA
whose ﬂoat was called, “Darn It,
Sports” and they received the en-
graved certiﬁcate. The scene was
of a stream, a beautiful girl seat-
ed beside it and a sailor ﬁshing‘
there.

Second place went-to the Kap-
pas. who were chosen because their
ﬂoat showed best the clarity of love
that all the ﬂoats depicted. Their
theme was of a soldier lying on
the ground writing a letter to his
sweetheart and dreaming of her in
a white ﬂowing. gown floating near
him on a cloud.

Honorable mention went to the
Beta Sigs, whose ﬂoat had the
title, “Gas Rati.oni11g.”

Last Friday, May 5th, the three most coveted senior awards were

remonies. Walter Jones is Omicron

Delta Kappa’s selection of outstanding senior man for this year, and
his name. will be inscribed on the ODK walk. This is the highest honor
a. man at Pitt can obtain and the choice is made on the basis of scholastic
achievement, participation in campus activities, and qualities of leader-

the University from Dormont High School‘

in 1940.‘ During high school days
he was active in basketball and »
track, and soon made a name for
himself in both basketball and
football. Walter has served on
Men.’s Council, Men’s Debate, and
this yearwas. president of'ODK,

and ’l.‘reasurer of Inter-Fra.-‘
ternity Council.
Eleanor Segelliwst will be

crowned Senior Queen. of the Class -

of 1944 on the morning of May‘30,
at ten o’clock in the Commons
Room. The ceremony, owhich will
be followed by laiibreakfast in the
social room of Stephen Foster Me-
morial. may be attended by parents,
‘friends. of the graduates, and stu-
dents and faculty of the University.
Preparations for the coronation
are being made by Doris Deaktor
C, chairman of the
Committee of ‘Women’s Self Gov-
ernment Association. ‘
The ceremony, the nineteenth"
coronation held at Pitt, is pat-
terned after the coronation of the
English king. It is unique among
American colleges in its setting,
symbols, and language used init.
As Betty Haldeman. last \year’s-
queen, . crowns Eleanor Segel-_t
horst, each senior woman will-
place a crown upon her own head.
Thus, the purpose of the cere-1
mony is not to ‘honor only onefi.
person, but all Pitt seniors, Of‘:
which the Senior Queen is an out-T
standing representative. ‘.
Senior women represellting the
abstract virtues of Truth, Valor,
Wisdom, Mercy, and Justice assist
the Senior Queen andiAlma' lVIa7ter,
who :represent all these qualities, in
the ceremony. Some former queens
will return to the campus to take
partvin the coronation. _
Eleanor Segelhorst, a graduate of
Allegheny high school, has served
111 such positions as president of the
Sophomore Class, chairman ofpthe
Customs Committee in her junior

With the last headline counted and the ﬁnal thirty typed

I‘  ‘editorial page. Should it be hello or goodbye at this time ? The

farewells were well takeii care of last week, and itseems futile

 to extend greetings for the coming" school year when the fol-

low—up issue is four months hence. The quickest way to solve
the problem is to ignore it and go on to a more worthwhile

Every year at this time, editors face the same situations

‘  and experiences that have confronted new editors for all the
~ psprings past. These experiences are at once new and time-

worn, following the general ‘pattern but with distinguishing
characteristics of their own. The rumors.that have reared
their heads are numerous. There have been hints to the effect
that all student publications will be curtailed because of the
war-time scarcity of printing materials and facilities. It has
been suggested that the coming year may ﬁnd the grou_nd

  ﬂoor oﬂice with few if any staff members due tothe accel-

erated program and the increasing modiﬁcation of 1A defer-
ments. These and -many other gloomy rumors darken the hori-
zon. But in spite of them the future remains bright.

As long as there are two students, a typewriter, and a story,

 A American Press Still Free

° Newspapers are like people. They are conservative and

 dependable, ﬂashy and capricious, radical and crusading. Tim-
id, little Mr. Milquetoast home editions, and bold, extroverted

Huey Long tabloids rub pages on the news-stands every day.
Like people, newspapers have been reared in adherence
to certain principles. That’s why American newspapers believe

~ in freedom of_speech and the press. Ever since they had such’
a hard time in their infancy when the United States was

just a babe-in-arms too, newspapers have valued their right

Things you ﬁght for always. mean more to you. The

lAmerican newspapers have used plenty of adhesive plaster in

their day, and they expect to keep on using it to patch them-

' selves up after battles against graft, corruption, and threat-

ened loss of liberty. But they also expect to keep on using
their rights and prerogatives as members of the great Amer-
ican democracy.

Sometimes the press has had its mouth gagged and its
‘hands tied behind its back, and has been told what to do.
It has seemed helpless. But its belief in the rightness of its
cause kept it going. Often on sheer nerve and ﬁber it has hung
on tenaciously, biding its time, and at the psychological
moment has thrown all its weight against the bonds, and
broken them, and then has taken up the ﬁght where it left off.

Newspapers, like people, are notalways right. Intention-

’ ally and otherwise, they commit grave errors. A few gangster-

like publications undertake a life of crime, but their career
is usually put to an end with speedy force by respectable fel-
low—newspapers. Editorial attacks, boycott, and public opinion

 can be as fatal to a Dillinger—paper as “the lady in red.”

‘Newspapers are usually cynical, hard-bitten, old roues
with the most sentimental interiors you ever saw. With re-
lentless, brutal thrusts they will jab at the sand-bagged pro-
tection of hypocrisy and pretense andsneer at the devious
workings of politics. In the next breath, they will dig into
their pockets for handkerchiefs with one hand, while the
other reaches out across the country to ﬁnd a rare medicine
for a dying child. ’

All these components of American newspapers make them
the voice of a democratic people. Although in the last several
years restrictions have been placed upon them that many
thinking newspaper people believe are smothering initiative
and honest presentation of the news, the American press can
still give thanks for its freedom.

Letters To The Editor’ . Q . .

-<— .ﬁ,._',,,_ . .__-,4./" V 5   f,-I‘.%\z~V.s:<‘.*:..'—.',x«F~' *

Editor’s note: this is a letter to
the editor, not signed, from a
group\. of students designating
themselves as the “Independent
Ass0ciation;” it does not necessa-
rily reflect the opinion of this pa-
per.

Editor,

The Pitt News.

With this, the last issue of the
“Pitt News,’-’ the activities season
ends unoilicially. And with the end
of the semester in sight we, the
members of Independent Associa-
tion, are at last forced to admit
total defeat in everything that we
had hoped to accomplish.

Our defeat is the result of our

cies and, more important, the irre-
sponsible and autocratic behavior
of ESGC. Had we organized one

than ‘seventy-ﬁve per cent of the
students of this university, could
easily have defeated the ESGC
constitution. Our failure to organ-
ize indicates that we and our fel-
low independents have been buried-
in a fathornless expanse of apathy.
As a result, fraternities, with bare-
ly their share of brains and abili-
ties, are able to dominate campus
activities and were able to monopo-

 

own “too little and too late” poli- *

ynonth sooner _we, numbering morell states that contains the p1'0Vl-

 

lize Tap Day. To all but a few in—.
dependents, Pitt is little more than
a gloriﬁed high school. Never hav-
ing known anything better, they are
content to sleep.
In closing our _aI'fairs for the
year we would like to warn the
ESGC mentalities that next year
we will resume the ﬁght with a
vengeance. We shall contact every
single GDI. We shall attempt to
instill in them a greater interest
in school aﬁairs, and if we suc-
ceed, our voting strength will he
‘irresistible. We will not tolerate
a farce such as the recent nomina-
tion for student government rep-
resentation. '

ESGC is perfectly aware that its
action in presentingva constitution
is illegal, its statement notwith-
standing. Their oﬂicial explanation

sions by whichithey ‘were able to
submit to the students a new con-
stitution. However, the amendment
to SFA which created ESGC isin
direct contradiction with provisions
of SFA. On points of contradiction,
the last law tofbe passed is legal:
ALL PREVIOUS LAWS ARE
RENDERED. INVALID BY THE
PASSAGE OF A NEW LAW IN.

 

CONTRADICTION TO THEM.

  r-sa-y. 

Thus, as the last law of the consti-
tution, the ESGC amendment is
valid while all previous law is in-
valid. This point of law is prepos-
terously simple.

.,_ 3“:

\
,.’

Nevertheless, ESGC persists with "H I

the determination to have. its own .
way. We are powerless to combat A

this with mere logic. Therefore, we
admit defeat. ’

If the constitution were half
decent we would not oppose it
despite its Ilaunting of law. Pri-
marily it is a. subtle expedient to
overthrow the SFA provision. for
equal representation. Past inde-
pendents fought for this for years.
Now it is to be overthrown by an
unrepresentative committee. A

Even so, if the constitution con-

tained other admirable features, we ‘I

would be willing to take the chance
of possible fraternity perpetuation
in oﬁice. But, the main article of
this document labeled a constitution

contains only eightywords. If any ?“ A it

one of us is able to compress a faint‘-
ly reasonable constitution in eighty

words it would be the eighth wonder B 

of the world. .
It’ll be a different story next fall,
we hope.

Yours sincerely,

Independent Association. ~

Goodbye. all you good people, 
goodbye. This is the last ssue of the '
.=’\’curs this year and the last for me
for some time. Not much news
about the engineers. Most of them
aren't going to class these days.
They’re really catching up on their
baseball though . . . If an engineer
has a happy look on his face, it's
due to one of two things: either he
is 4-5‘ or he has just realized a life-
long ambition to tell his “favorite”
prof to go to Hell . . . A lot of the
boys are joining the Merchant Ma-
rine, so don’t expect many convoys
to get through for awhile.
Thoughts I leave behind: Why
was Jimmy Day looking for Dick
Slater Monday afternoon? Hmmm?

smell like an ice cream factory on
April 26? . . . What's the little
man's name who ties “nots” in your
hair at night.

. . . Jim Davis made sure he had a
good time. He leaves for the navy

on the 22nd . . . Bill Huines and
McMarlin in tow again. It's getting
so that I don’t know whether to get
out the little black book when they
are together or when they are not
together .. . . For a. girl that can't
swim, Jeanne Goushe really goes
for the navy. She seems to prefer
those with the gold though.

Having a tough time ﬁnding
enough dirt to write a column with
these days, people are living too
clean lives, “Barnsmell” has a long-
er handled shovel than I, so he gets A
more stuff. I don’t do so well since
I resolved to write only the truth.

“The Old Soak” came to Pittsburgh in the wake of a mild pubiici1._\'
campaign which promised everything in the line of enjoyment. To111o1~_:.=u2’~.v
night it will eave Pittsburgh in the wake of a wave of indifference. And

good riddance.

As a turkey “The Old Soak” is rather unique. Other ﬂoppos induin-_ V

(1) a desire to vomit, (2) a desire to sleep, (3) the unpleasant feeling:

that someone has diluted ﬁgurative perfume with ﬁgurative lll‘!lb1l1‘g‘(,"l' .
, ——the plot has possibilities but the playwritc has not followed through

his advantages, (4) the desire to"> ’

laugh at a serious attempt which
has developed into a ludicrous pom-
posity. “The Old Soak” was none
of these.

Essentially the play is an at-
tempt to combine melodrama and
comedy. Approximately half the
dialogue is intended for humor‘
and half is intended for melo-
drama. The humor is mildly
funny in spots and the serious
situation is mildly interesting
two or three times. The net re-
sult is an evening wasted. For an
investment of two hours and the
price of a seat the dividends are
distinctly disappointing. Still, the
quality of the play is so cont-
sistent and the intentions so
laudable and the acting so medi-
ocre that we are unable to con-
demn it with any vigor. IndiEer-
ence breeds indefference. Ho-hum.

If it is desired that the silver
lining of this cloud be explored, we
must strain our precious and irre-
placable eyes. Guy Kibbee had a
few genuinely funny lines; Ralph
Douglass was more convincing
than his lines wouldiindicate; Don
Marquis the playwrite, managed
to sneak a little of his philosophy
into the proceedings.

On the other hand, the all too

Miss Haun said, “and it is ﬁtting
that speech teachers in Western
Pennsylvania meet together at
this time to consider problems in
wartime and our need to empha-
sgqq qv ,'A‘.1oqogA .10; qoeeds, ezgs
meeting the advisability of form-

ing a western Pennsylvania speech
aSSOC1a'i3l0l'1 will be discussed.”

obvious ﬂaws: the theme was hope-
lessly outdated; Shakespeare could

not have done it much good. Guy .

Kibbee ran through his lines, wad-
dled across the stage like a mechan-
ical man, and spoke without expres-
sion. He should have “stood in bed,”
or, better yet, in Hollywood. The
stereotypes were so rigid that the
actors could hardly breathe. The
villian hissed, the drunkard had a
red nose, the hero was misunder-
stood, righteousness triumphed. Ho
Hum.

This review is of necessity the
final one of the season. Not wish-
ing to bid farewell. to my ﬂutter-
ing followers, I can do no more
than offer a word of advice before
thrusting them into the cruel cold
callous world. Next week the
Nixon will play host to a musical»
revue, “Slap Happy.” Since such
ventures depend upon the ability.
of the performers rather than-
upon the shifting quality of play-
writing, it ought to be worth
looking into.

The following week “Abie’s Irish

Rose” returns to relieve the~low-
brows of their cash. I’ve seen 7’it

and have not yet been able to de-’ "

termine if it falls under the head-

ing of stink no. 1 or stink no.3 2.‘

(See the second paragraph.) -To

further illustrate the extent of my F

revulsion—-I would rather have tea
with Flattop than see “Abie’s Irish
Rose.”

“Winged Victory” will be here in A

June. See it if you possibly can.
New York reports indicate that it
is a war classic. “

My apologies to John Almoor and

Norman Weismann whom I did not i 

mention last week.

‘W-hen Glenn Miller furloughed from the band business two years
ago to join Uncle Sam’s Army, his band was way up on top. In a salute
to Captain Glenn Miller, Victor has released an album of the discs that
did much to boost him to the front ranks. Six swing hits, “American
Patrol,” “Little-Brown Jug,” “In the Mood,” “Song of the Volga Boat-

lmen,” “Tuxedo Junction” and “Pennsylvania Six-Five Thousand” share
honors with “Star Dust” and “Moonlight Serenade” to make up the set.
The discs are all plenty good. Along with the Miller album comes a new

the big cities such as New York are
closed down and the Future of the
others is none too bright. The tax

much yet as the extra thirty cents
doesn’t mean much to the big money
makers about town. Big business
has been done at Bill Green’s and
the Vogue Terrace this week. A
very ﬁne ﬂoor show together with
Skip Strahl’s really solid new band
has kept the Terrace packed this
week, and next week the “Har-

students were secretly hoarding gas
so they could ‘go home and catch up
on some sleep. Don’t know who
needs the most . . . the students or
the recently initiated Pitt Riﬂes
members.

January 7——Spa1-kle, sparkle, lit-
tle diamond. One needed dark glass-
es to escape the glare of all the en-
gagement rings that Pitt co-eds
came back from vacation with. All
the joy disappeared when exam
week was announced.

January 'l4——The by-line on Pitt-
pourri read . . . “Snoot N Scoop and
Ivan Evileye.” Wonder who they
are? Covering the front page were
stories on the “Paper Doll” dance,
Elaine Kahn leaving the sports
staff, and a feature on how to pass
exams. The last one was very in-
teresting.

February 2—Registrati.on again.
Had to write my name so many
timeson so many cards, that I was
soon writing cards ‘on my name.

February l1——-Pitt girls weren’t
really hard up for men. They were
just out hunting for dates for the
Sadie Hawkins dance. The Hatchet
Hop and progressive IF dances were
also given some space in the week-
ly epistle.

February 18-—Everyone on cam-
pus interested in the regulations
issued by the Selective Service Bu-
reau concerning student deferment
policy.

February 25———Charter Day for
Pitt was headline news. Lots of
things have happened since 157
years ago when the founding of
the University took place. Bet no
one ever.though.t that the Army
would be living in Pitt in 1944.

March 3—Many AST’s were go-
ing around with long, sad faces.
The government decided to move
them onward.

March l0——Ru;)orle.r.- wrote and

Outstanding students were at last
shown some appreciation; they re-
ceived awards at the Scholars’ Day
program in the Commons Room.

March 24——The engineers are so
special that a separate rushing
week was arranged for them. Mem-
bers of the Cadet Nurse Corps
rated a long story and picture be-
cause the yﬁnally got their new uni-
forms.

March 31-What an issue! What
an issue! We fooled everybody and
put an April Fool’s Day paper out a
day ahead of time.

April 5~—Believe itor not, the Pitt
stadium was turned into a class-
room. Coach Shaughnessy held the
“T” clinic and from reports, his
“pupils” were most attentive.

April 14——All Helzapoppin Hop
was breaking loose in the Tuck
Shop. It was poppin’ in the News
oﬁice too as another twelve-page
servicemen’s issue had to be rushed
to the printer’s.

April 21~—Results of Women’s
Elections shared the spotlight with
story about the Med and Dent stu-
dents moving into the Cathedral.

April 26-Panhellenic Ball. set
for Saturday night and all the fra-
ternity women out again asking the
men to a dance. The Independents
also out . . . they charged the new

The
Sideline Coach

By LEN TANNENBAL'.\I
sports editor
Although a little less than half
(three to be exact) of Pitt's abbre-
remains

‘well behaved on the diamond. In
fact the Panther has been so con-
siderate of its opponents that it has
been over a year since Coach Mit-
terling's charges have been able to

- boast a win. At present their great-

est trouble seems to be lack of co-
ordination. If the pitching is up
perchance, either the hitting is off
or the inﬁeld manages to spring a
leak or two.

The sole hope of savlation for the
current campaign lies in the possi-
bility that the Panther diamondeers
may shake the jinx that has
plagued them to record their first
victory in thirteen starts. They

’ will have no better chance to accom-

plish this feat than today when
they will have a ‘golden opportunity
to avenge their inaugural setback
by Juniata’s red hot Indians, who
this week upset the dope to score a
5-3 triumph over Bucknell’s navy-

stocked squad. The Mitterling men

have come so close, -though, in every
game except the Army contest that
we feel they are about due to turn

_ the trick. -

* * =I=

Despite the fact that baseball
continues to hold the national eye,
it is not too long before football
will take over. Clark Shauglmessy
has announced that he will conduct
the first Panther gridiron workouts

‘ ,. the last week in June, scheduling

four practices a week for the next
six or eight weeks. One point that
he would like to emphasize par-
ticularly is that everyone who is

' interested in the gridiron sport, re-

gardless of whether they have had
any previous experience or not, is
invited to come out.

Doc Hartwig’s racketeers hit
the road this week in quest of
their initial victory. They take on
Oberlin’s service stocked racket
today. Tomorrow they
visit Ohio State . . .

Pi Lambda Phi and Phi Gamma
Delta are battling down the home-
stretch to the interfraternity soft-
ball crown as they go into the last
two weeks deadlocked for top
honors.

The Phi Gains won their latest

‘Monday, outslugging the Phi Eps,

22-12, in a hit and run affair. The
Friday before that the Pilams
tightened up in an extra inning to
push across four counters and de-
feat the Phi Delts, 6-2. According
to Mike Josephs this was the “out-
standing game of the season."
The pitching was the best in the
league with Doug Cox in the mound
for the Phi Delts and Nate Apple

Shaughnessy’s football eleven and
one of Coach Mitterling’s brightest
spots, is a physical education ma-
jor. His ambition is to be end up
in the collegiate coaching business.
. . . The quest for the all-point
trophy continues with the four year
reign of the Phi Gams being seri-
ously threatened by PiKA, Phi
Delta Theta, and Pi Lambda Phi.
