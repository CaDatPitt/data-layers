A *"‘Midwestern critic, said of
Tong Il Han’s performance. “It is
Il long time since I have been
so impressed by a young artist.

“Judged by any standard, -the
program was an ambitious one
which required. technical brilli-
ance, sound technique, and high
musicianship in its successful
performance. Tong 11 Ban dis-

played all these.” i

Another critic had. this to say:
-“Although Mr. Han has a quiet
keyboard manner, Tie displays vast
assurance carrying the listener
along in a feeling of absolute
rightness of musical style whether
in Bach, Mozart, or Chopin.”

Decision To Come

Soon on“Calenda5r

to Choose Best

Administration

Of Four Proposed Schedules

A decision will soon be reached by the University on the V

four recently proposed calendar‘ plans for trimester, accord-
ing to Dr. JohnsGeise, vice chancellor of student ailairs. If
either of two of these plans are selected, the trimester would.
then include a final examination week. . .

The four plans are iasfollows: a ﬁfty minute class hour

with an exams week; a ﬁfty min-5
ute class hour without a finals‘

week; a sixty minute class hour
with a ﬁnals week; or a sixty min-
ute -class hour without ,a ﬁnals
week. I A

In May of this year the Univer-
sity faculty, members of the stu-
dent organizations, and students
selected at random _ were asked
their preferences of these calen-
dars.

‘At this tii.ie,;Dr. Geise stress
ed that these preferences would
be considered, however, they

«would not be binding‘ on the
ﬁnal decision. ,.

The four calendar plans were
formulated by the Office if Insti-

.._tutional Planning, the Education

Policies Committee, and Dr. Geise.
 The sixty ' ‘minute class hour
iwith a ﬁnal examinations week
received the most approval -at the
Student Government Senate meet-
ing when the plans were ‘ﬁrst an-
nounced.

» It was felt that the ﬁnals week
was necessary because the student
was still at a disadvantage .bylhav-
ing insufficient time to prepare for

. ﬁnals.

Presently the trimester pro-
vides for MA weeks of school
with no speciﬁc time set aside
for ﬁnals. The semester plan
which was used prior to the Fall
term, 1959, was 14.95 weeks in
length, exclusive of the ﬁnal
week. »

generally wellorganized but could
have been much better when one
considers the fact that 168 regist-
ered students did not pick up their
bids. , ~ ‘

“A period of informal or open
rushing will be conducted for two
weeks. and it is hoped that ad-
ditional pledges can be secured
during this period.”

“As everyone knows, the caliber
of each entering freshman class

is on the upswing. Thus, it is rea- ,

sonable to assume that the tra-
ternities are securi-nyg many. top-

Hundreds of students were assembled in the Ballroom,

 "eagerly listening to the ‘address by one of the great minds of
ourgeneration. A knocking was heard at the door on the

right side of the Ballroom. All heads turnedin that direc-

’The knocking stopped, and the audience turned its at-
tention to the speaker. A few minutes later, a rapping was

. heard at the back door, Students shifted uncomfortably in, .

ftheir chairs, turned to the direction of the sound, then rap- ‘
idly glanced at the speaker, wondering if he, too,.had no-
/,t_iced—. the disturbance. S

j-..'~? The rear door opened, anda crowd of students eagerly‘

Tcraned their necks to get .a view_,o_f this great man. Some of
Twthem walked down to the front of the center table, and

seated themselves comfortably on the floor. The audience
turned to View them.~ Sounds from the outside corridor

c_ echoed through the room.

Such was the confusion at last week’s Midday Series
program, featuring Aldous Huxley, when nearly a thousand-

people crowded into the Ballroom prepared to seat 675 peo-

ple." , V K a
This was not the first time that such a situation took

place at a Midday program. Last year when Senator John
Kennedy, Bennett Cerf, and C. _,Northcote Parkinson, to

 jpmention a few, appeared» in the Ballroom, similar disturb-'
 ances occurred. ‘

The reason for these incidents is simply that the Stu-
dent Union Ballroom was designed to be a ballroom, not an
auditorium. The acoustics are poor andlnoises from the out-

side resound through the room. Besides this,lthe seating ca-

pacity is insufﬁcient for the number of students enrolled at

V the University. .

Although an» auditorium is available in Stephen Foster
Memorial, the seating capacity there is also inadequate.
Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall is used for a few Uni-
versity events, such as the convocations, but it is not a part

of the University and not readily, available. for University
use.

, What is needed is a large, on-campus auditorium which
can accomodatelcrowds similar to that at last Wednesday’s
Midday program. Then, students would not be inconven-

g, ienced or embarrassed when noted guests come to the Uni-
versity. V

_ _Programs such as symphonies and theater performances
could be adequately accomodated, and would be available
to all students, not solely to those who arrive twenty min-

"utes before program time.

The Leaning   Tower

By Matthew Nesvisky .

The, ﬁrst day the Pittsburgh Pirates play a
World Series game in Forbes Field, the Cathedral
of Learning and all its inhabitants will be doomed.

It all started a few days ago as I was hurrying
along the 16th ﬂoor hall of the ‘
Psychology Department- in the
Cathedral. It was then that I
lost my marbles. The ones that
I was carryingto the Psych Lab,
that is. They were to be used-
in an experiment to investigate
the cheating habits of rats play-
ing Chinese Checkers. This,
however, is irrelevant to the
story.

The marbles escaped through
a hole in the pocket of my Rob-
ert’ Hall sport coat, naturally, They began to
scatter about the floor of the hall like the audience
dashing to the restrooms at the intermission of
“Ben-Hur.” It was then that I learned two in-
teresting facts: (1) when chasing lost marbles, one
should be extremely careful not toistep on them,
and (2) marbles dropped in the sixteenth floor
of the Cathedral all roll in one direction.

These two facts impressed me: The former
physically, the latter mentally. I had to know why
those marbles rolled only to one end of the hall.
After much experimentation of dropping, chasing

and falling over them, I arrived at one conclusion ,

— I was late for class.
Off to the "White House“

Needless to say, the question hammered away
at me day and night. Finally, I decided that the
only way I could receive some authoritative infor-
mation of this phenomenon was to go to ,an

' authortative source of information.

'l‘his brilliant reasoning brought me to that

 

of -  
funny little white information oﬂice across the
street from the Cathedral. There I received a ser-
ious little bit of white information which predicted
a black future for our (University. My suspicions
of .foul play were confirmed: the Cathedral of
Learnir’lg‘is leaning. . , -

The Cathedral is tilted several’ degrees off
center.‘ This is the result of theﬂcombineda weight
of the thousands of cheapskate students who have
been watching the ball games in Forbes Field
from the upper ﬂoors of the building throughout
the season. ~
Shake. Raffle and Fall .

This in itself, although startling, is not the
half of it, for when the Series begins here in "the
city‘, *I believe that the Leaning Tower of Pitts-
burgh will tremble, quake, and with a deafening
groan, crumble to the ground in a cataract of far-
ﬂying concrete, steel and glass, the likes of which
has never been seenmsince Freud made his famous
Slip. ’

What can be done to prevent this nasty waste
of school property from occurring? One answer
is to convince the Pirates to play the Series in
Clapp-Hall. This way, with students jamming to
the other side of the building,- the Cathedral could
be straightened. Or perhaps the team could decide
the championship by ﬂipping a coin. This would
result in an equal amount of excitement with a
minimum amount of effort.

Although I am sure that the Bucs would be
willing to do anything in their power to save the
Cathedral of Learning from destruction, I feel that
perhaps too many complications would arise with
these arrangements. The only alternative left,
therefore, is to call the whole thing off. Con-
sidering the gravity of the situation, I feel certain
that civic—minded Pittsburgh would be willing to

Tell the truth now — wasift
that editorial concerning the

Mr. Saga.himself? If not, the.

author must have been a “cash
customer,” for I’ll admit that
their food may be warm, and
they certainly do havea tremen-
dous choice compared wit? the
meal ticket holders. V
Today, for instance, I had my
choice of either ravioli or a fatty
ham and cheese sandwich on
hamburger bun, ‘while my paying
friends could decide between ﬁsh

sticks, ravioli, beef sandwich and’

one or two other delectable con-
coctions. S '

‘ The food, however, does taste
better, the opportunity for sec-

‘onds is appealing, besides I like i
. “the iced tea. ’
Come to think ofit, it’s really-

not bad at all. But I’ve got to
complain about something -- and
there’s not much left to -gripe
about since the mess at registra-
tion is gone and the Tuck Shop
has been remodeled.

So, the only institution left is
the Saga Food Service (G-od

Editor, The Pitt News:

In her September 21st article,
Miss Beverly Roberts speaks of
“the dignity and individuality”
which a Republican Administra-
tion assures. But how much dig-
nity does a schoolteacher have,
when his salary is less-than that
of a school janitor? How much
dignity does an aged person
have when he must declare him-
self a pauper to receive adequate
medical attention? How m u c h
dignity does
worker in a ‘depressed area have,

would give-that worker a decent

How much dignity does a

to. put the moral weight of his
office behind‘ the a Supreme

can only attend school for half

How much dignity does any
American have, when he watches

when he watches communism
establish a forward base 90 miles

John Medaris, Ma~tthew’Ridge-

way) resign under protest be-
cause of the inadequacies of our
defenseisystem? I wonder, in-

deed, whose dignity Miss Roberts. “

is speaking of? '
There are, -moreover, several
other fallacies in Miss Roberts’

article which should not go. un-

noticed. If Miss Roberts were

A “an‘interest‘ed voter with some

knowledge of economics” she
would know of the concept call-
ed the growth “rate and should
also know that U.S. growth rate
fell from a 4.5 yearly average in,
1945-52 to a 2.3 yearly average
in 1952-60.. She would also know
that there would have been 4 to

5 billion dollars annually added «

to the federal treasury, without
a tax increase. '

If Miss Roberts had read Sen-
ator Paul Douglas’ report on De-
fense Department expenditures,
she would have found that 2-3
billion dollars could be saved if
the Republican administration
did not insist on paying $21.10
for 25 cent lamp sockets, $29.00
for $4.00 wrench sets and $9.65
for 50‘ cents’ worth of drill bush-
ings (these, of course, are only
a few examples.)

Miss Roberts’ statement not-
withstanding; moveover, Senator
Kennedy has not advocated a tax
cut, even though it is a popular
issue. In fact, it is to Kennedy’s
credit that he has had the cour-
age to tell the American people
that they must be willing to

   

 
 
 
 

make sacriﬁces if we are to re- I

gain our ‘world position and meet

' our domestic responsibilities.

Miss Roberts condemns the
Democrats for their “rash” pro-
mises. Yet, it is" the Republican

platform which promises federal .-

salaries “comparable to those
offered‘ by private employers”

and takes credit for the “liberal

pay7 (and) fringe beneﬁts” of
postal employees. Could this be
the same Republican Party
whose President vetoed,

pay increase which. federal em-
ployes have enjoyed in eight
years? This, of course, is only
one of his “rash” promises con-
tained in the Republican plat-
form. ’

It is interesting to note that
Miss Roberts cites ‘a quotation
from Senator Robert Taft. Taft,
to be sure, was“ a conservative.
But even herealized that when
there is a job that must be done,
and neither local government nor
private enterprise can do it, then
the Federal government must.

We have always had slum con-
ditions . . . it is up to us (the

Senate) to do the job.” Federal\,
aid to housing is one of Senator

Kennedyfs programs and is -one
where the Republicans, char-
acteristically, have labeled “so-
cialist.”

The “welfarestate” and “so-
cialist” labels, indeed, are not
new. Republicans used them (as
one example) in 1936, when S0-
cial Security was introduced.
(93% of their ranks voted
against the original bill.) Today
all Republicans, save those of
the Goldwater ilk, praise the so-
cial security system. Richard
Nixon recently called it a “great
advance” in U.S. history.

Probably 20 or 30 years from
now, Republicans will also praise
and support Federal aid to edu-
cation, medical care for the aged
through Social Security, aid to
housing and area redevelopment.
But the needs exist today and
must be met today. In times such
as these, America cannot afford
the small-paced decision-making
of the Republican Party.

.i:;iHuxley Urges Education 

Of Imagination, Senses

Before a large Midday Series crowd, Aldous Huxley.
stressed that education of the senses, the perceptions, and

,, the imagination must be given to'release' us from “the in-"

credibly dull world we live in all the time.” “We must keep

alive the other world,” he said.

Answering the question “why are precious stones preci-

ous,” Huxley stated

gla-ss-like elements of Plato’s other
earth where colors are much purer
than they are here.
World Visioned

Because of this visionary world

of the mind, we regard things in

‘four existing world as precious.

One may enter the other
world through daydreams and
fantasy, for at the back of every
mind there is the storytelling
faculty, “People under deep
-hypnosis, who do not have this
ability in their natural state,
will come up with tremendous
stories.” In this way We all
carry the other world within us.

Consciousness of the visionary

‘,world is an “objective subjectiv-

ity, a kind of out there in the
mental idea of space.”
Children See
“But,” Huxley said, “one can
have visions and hallucinations
yet remain sane. The majority of
children have some sort of vision-
ary experience.”

Drugs used to induce visions
include Lysergic acid diethyla-
mide (LSD), mescaline from the
peyote cactus, and a substance;
in Mexican sacred mushrooms.
Huxley added that these drugs

body or mind, except in_ rare

Huxley explained that visions
are not erratic, for “each vision
belongs to a species of experien-
ces..’’ ,

In the study of peyote, the pat-
tern “begins with visions of living
geometry which turns into carpets
or mosaics, and then to fantastic
architecture encrusted with gem-

like objects, or vast landscapes or !

great ﬁgures.”

“Light is the highest common
factor in these 'experiences—-
pure white light witliout any
form.”

Huxley stated that ﬁgures when .
“They ‘

seen are never familiar.
are never faces of people the sub-
ject knows, but appear as strang-
ers in the street who come to us
as we walk along.”
Figures Contemplate

He commented that the angelic
ﬁgures of heaven and paradise in
the scriptures are not human but
rather, beings of anentirely differ-
ent order. “These ﬁgures are never
in action, are not doing anything
in particular, but are in a state
of contemplation.”

This visionary art, said Hux-
ley .“is the kind which is used
at the very center of holy abod-
ings in all religions.” Stained

’ glass windows, where one feels

to be inside “an immense grow-
ing gem,” contain this visionary
quality.

Huxley told how “all this world
of ritual, is aiming at bringing
the beholder through the lower
reaches of the other world to the
highest form of mystical experi-
ence.” He said that this is done‘
through the vision inducing cere-
monials of the church.

Panthers Look

Next Saturday
For First Win

By TED COLTON

Sports Editor

Well, the Panther gridders will be going into their third
game next Saturday,‘ and they are still looking for their ﬁrst
win. Both “losses,” against UCLA and Michigan State, were

.hard to take, but the Cats still have eight games left to re-

deem themselves.
I think Quarterback Dave Kraus summed things up
when he said, “We have a good team, but we’ll never be

_ able to run up the score against anyone. Each team we meet

is going to be tough, just like Michigan State was today and
UCLA was last week.”

The Panthers were tough on defense, and their offensive
attack looked l.ike it was ready to jell. As soon as the Pan-
thers start shaking some of their backs loose for that long
run, the Panthers will start winning. I’m looking for it to

» happen next week against Oklahoma.

Another thing in favor of the Panthers next week
will be the fact that I pick the Sooners to give John Mich-
e1osen’s boys their first loss of the season.

' * * * * *

The student section was almost ﬁlled. I knows they’
weren’t all students, but the greater majority were..The.

cheering was not as good at it ‘should have been, but it was
better than last year.

I would like to commend Block P for the fine job
they did Saturday in front of. the national television
audience. They also did most of the cheering with the
other two sections helping very little.

It will be impossible to keep non-students out of the

student section with‘the way the administration has set up

the student ticket situation. But I guess we will have to put

As for the game, some people are saying that the
Panthers should have won. Well the statistics show that
Michigan State should have won. They outgained uscon
the ground and in the air by 186 yards. But the statistics
don’t always tell the story. ‘ A

‘ All-American Mike Ditka commented, “UCLA hit
harder on defense, and their backs were faster. But
Michigan had a better olfensive attack, and I think they
were the .better team.” ,

As for Ditka, he turned in his second all-American per-
formance. Some say that he is the best all-around end in
the country. '

The two other Pitt athletic teams got off to a good
start by posting wins over the weekend. Coach Carl Rees’
cross—country boysbeat Slippery Rock on Friday, and Leo
Bemis’ booters beat Frostburg 3-1 on Saturday.

tively.

the spread of our ﬁve men. It
was only 46 seconds between
our ﬁrst and ﬁfth man.”

Harry Stokes commented after-
wards, “We were running together
and they (Shirey, and Giolosa)
passed me on Lake Hill. I over-
took them and ran with them for
awhile, but they pulled away. I
think the late start we had prac-
ticing hurt us. We still aren’t our
best and we’ll do better next
time.”

Slippery Rock Coach congrat-
ulated Rees following the meet,
“You had them buch there, Carl.
If we would have had someone
in the middle. it would have
been different.” ~ .

Later he said. “I expected my
ﬁrst man and second man to win,
but my third man came in last. He
should have been in the middle.
He said he tightened up.” So the

from Damri Uawithya.

Uawithya almost didn’t make ‘

the trip with the Panther booters
for it wasn’t "until Friday that "he
passed his physical. Although
Uawithya comes from Thailand
last Saturday he was a Panther
that proved his worth,
Cats Tire

“The boys were really tired
afterthe game,” said Coach Be-
mis. The practice ﬁeld that we use
is very hard and easy to run on;
On the other hand, Frostburg has
a soft turf and it wore the play-
ers out.’’ ,

Coach Bemis added, “It was a
very rough game a.nd their play-
ers were bigger physically than
ours. However, we used more
ﬁnesse in our playing which ac-
counted for the victory. This

S was a hard fought victory'and
the boys sure earned it.”

The Panthers could use some
more running to get them in bet-
ter condition. With the injury to
Cuthbert and after seeing the
team in action a few adjustments
may have to be made.

The Blue and Gold played as
good as they were expected and
now have that all important ﬁrst
victory under their belts. The Cats
will now prepare to meet another
tough opponent, Slippery Rock on
Wednesday.

 

‘Accident’   Play 

Spartan, Cats
Battle to  
Deadlock 

By JACK SIVIITH

An accident cost the Pan-
thers a victory.

“The pass play that Michi-
,gan State scored on was just
an accident,” Coach John
Michelson said- a f t e r the

The accident, however,
cost the Panthers a victory as

game.

_ the game ended in a 7-7 tie.

With oniy seconds "remaining in
the half, and the Spartans trailing
7-0 Tom Wilson hurled a long
pass intended to put the Spartans
back in the game. E'd Sharockman
attempted to intercept the pass but
tipped the ball to Jason Harness
who evaded a lone Panther de-
fender for the score. Art Brand-
statter kicked the extra point, and
the game was knotted with ﬁve
seconds left in the half. ..

“I tried to intercept the pass,”
Sharockman said. “Possession of
the ball seemed important so the
interception attempt seemed, worth

the gamble.”
, . Short Lived Lead.
Seconds earlier the Panthers

scored when Dave Kraus passed

    

to MikevDitka who made a diving /“L

catch in the end zone. Fred Cox

added_the extra pointthat gave
the Panther a short lived 7-0 lead.
It was the ﬁrst time in two games
that the Panthers went to the air
effectively. 

Football teams generally co‘m-
plain about not having" enough
time ’ to score that winning
touchdown. Not so, with the
Panthers who have been con-
stantly ﬁghting the clock that

\..\

always seems to have too many - .,

seconds remaining.

Last week UCLA managed to
score with 33 seconds left and up-
ended the Panthers 8-7. Saturday
with ﬁve seconds remaining in the
ﬁrst half Michigan State scored.

Ditka Comments -

“We can’t continue to play’ only
59 minutes and ‘55 seconds of foot-
ball,” Mike Ditka, Panther captain
said. “We have a team that should
be winning ball games; But ﬁrst
we must play the entire game at
our best.”

In the second half, neither
team was able to score although
both had equal opportunities.
Tempers were hotter than the
‘afternoon’s temperature as a
scufﬁe broke-out near the end of
the game. Neither team gained
an advantage. _

Statistically, Michigan S t a t e
held the upper hand. The Spartans
racked up 19 ﬁrst downs to the
Panthers 11.‘ ‘Net yards rushing
was 171 for the Spartans to 85 for
the- Cats. In the air, Michigan
State held a 100—yard edge as they
completed 11 of 26 passes for 188
yards. The Panthers completed
eight of 11 attempts.

 Head Grounds-Keeper
Adds Color to School

‘Horse’ Czarnecki Explains Theory on ‘Gus’;
Keeps Athletic Fields in Working Condition,
' By JIM 0’BRIEN I
As one enters the Field House and walks up the stairs at

'\

 

' “Horse,”

5‘ '_ the main entrance, he’ll see the directory at the top. Imme-

diately he’ll notice the names Michelosen, Timmons, Cec-

C coni, Rees and Czarnecki. Who is Czarnecki?

A sign onvthe ﬁrst door past the vending machines reads:
Maintenance & Grounds. This is Czarnecki’s ofﬁce. Even his

best friends don’t know his realb
name; they call him “Horse.”

“Horse” was sitting in his ex-
ecutive type chair reading some
information on sports equipment.
An interview was scheduled with
him last Monday, but "arrange-
ments conflicted. He said, “Where
were you Monday? You should
have had my story in; it would
have sold out.” . '

Responsible Crew

He has worked at the Stadium
for 12 years. He was a laborer
for two, a foreman for three, and
has headed the staff for seven.
His crew is responsible for pre-
paring ﬁelds and equipment for
nearly every imaginable aspect of
the athletic teams at the Uni-
versity. '

They care for the Stadium,
the ‘Field House, Trees Field,
Kennard Field, Vvildwood Coun-
try Club and the varsity prac-
tice ﬁeld. They make prepara-
tions for gym classes and do
odd jobs.

“Horse” is football personiﬁed.
He is 5’-11” and weighs about 190
counting a huge chaw of tobacco
which is omnipresent. His close-
cropped hair and rugged appear-
ance tabs him as one of Michelos-
en’s interior linemen, but he’s in-
eligible.

-— Letters Marked “Horse”

When asked why everyone calls
him “Horse,” he spelled it out for
us: “L-E-O C-Z-A-R-N-E-C-K-I.
Now you know why they call me
“Horse.” They often send me let-
ters from the Cathedral marked
otherwise I never get
them.”

There are 18 men on his
crew. One of them is a twin
brother. One day former Ath-
letic Director, Tom Hamilton,
unaware of the “double-expo-
sure,” hollered, “Hey, Horse!”
The brother paid no attention
and turned to his buddy and

said, “Who’s he? What’s he
want?”
Current AD, Frank Carver,

solved the identiﬁcation problem.
He distinguished the two by their
facial color. “Horse” works out-
doors and is tanned; his brother
works’”inside and has a P319 Com"
plexion.

Czarnecki feels his crew doesn’t
receive due credit. “This endeavor
isn’t a one man job; without a
crew, we can’t do,” he claimed in
a poetic manner. “Without them
I'm nothing. Anything that looks
good is ‘cause of the crew. What
could Litchﬁeld do without those
other aces? »

2 “Horse” has a pecular habit of

addressing everyone as “Gus.”
He explained, “One day I was
down'at Forbes Field and they
had a ‘Gus Fan Club Day.’
That's where I got the idea. I
deal with over 1,000 people at

different times, and I call most ’

of them Gus. .It’s easier, than
. carrying a scoreboard. You can’t
remember all those guys."

“I used to call Tom Hamilton
“Big Gus.” I new his name, I
mean, but he got a big kick out of
it.” He calls all the coaches by
various nicknames, but didn’t
want to tell us all of them. He
said, “Those coaches want respect
and they don’t.want guys calling
them nicknames.” Just then Steve

(Petra, assistant football coach,

walked by and Czarnecki inquir-
ed, “Where you going, Spider?”
Helps Gridders

, “Horse,” who many think is
called Horace, played a significant
role in the off-season training of
several football players. Cun-
ningham, Ditka, Clemens, Delfine,
Vignali, and Fornadel worked on
the crew during the summer

.months to keep in shape.

Czarnecki is on call 24 hours
a day during the year. He av-
erages about 9-10 hours a day,
but during the basketball sea-'
son he puts in 16 hours.

Dr. Carl Peterson, head of the
physical’ education department,
commented, “It’s uncanny how
you can tell him to put something
somewhere on the second Tuesday
of the month and it’ll be there.
You never have to tell him any-
thing twice.”

Multiply this by the hundreds
of similar requests he receives
and you get an idea of how effi-
cient he is. Peterson added, “He
says every man who wears a tie
around here is his boss. But with-
out “Horse” we would be in
trouble.” -

 

 

Smith Leads 
Yogae After
Second Wee];

Jack (Scoop) Smith ﬁnally
has obtained his life’s ambi-
tion. He is the top pickeryin
the Yogi race. Scoop posted
an outstanding 11-2 record
last week to bring his over

all record to 18-15.
This put him two games in front
of the player, who was Jumbo Jim
Cunningham. Smith feeling elated
with his-ﬁne picking performance
said, “I’m thinking about going
into the picking business. If any-
one needs any help on picking the
games for next week just see me,
and I’ll set you straight. For a
small fee that is.”
Cunningham’s fling at picking
games resulted in an 8-5 perform-
ance. The big surprise of the week
was Joanne (Speedy) Dolinar. Her
10-3 record put the boys to shame.
Following S p e e d_ In. -the .
standings . are Marsh l Romeo

(8-5). Romeo would like to get

a couple of things straight for

the Yogi readers. First of all

his name Romeo is no reflection
on his ability to pick the games.

And second, he is very proud to
. move ahead of Consensus in the
standings.

Consensus had a 7-6 week which
was good enough for ﬁfth place.
Following Consensus is Coach Bob
Timmons who was 7-? for the
week and the coach is now 12-11
overall. a

In last place is Ted (I’ll be
back) Colton who had the only
losing record, 5-8. The explana-
tion that he gave was that he
picked the teams while drinking
beer. ' J '

Johnson  Replaces”
Brown as Frosh  

E Harrier Coach

Better balance and a keen
interest in running are the
keywords that may spell suc-
cess for the freshman cross-
country team this year.

V e r n e Johnson succeeds

Bill Brown as frosh mentor and
comes from Kane High School
where he coached track, cross-
country, football and basketball.
His track team won the District 9
championship four of the six years
he was there. Johnson graduated
from the University in 1951.
Real Distance Men

Varsity coach Carl Rees com-
mented,“‘For a change we have
all real distance men. All of the
boys have had experience in cross
country running. Our varsity has
only two real distance runners.”

The seven boys who compose
the yearling harrier squad are:
Bill Mocnik, Larry Robinson,
Steve Waslo, A. J. Rice, Bob
Henry, Dick Cook and Jim Tay-
lor.

These boys are all good and no
one has been particularly excep-
tional.

“This is important,” Rees said,
“a cross-country team is good
when the boys run together in a
tight bunch. You have to have all
your boys ﬁnish pretty close, to

one another.”’  — ‘ ». '

The team wilrrun a 
meet with Central Catholic High
soon, and then they will em-y
bark on 3 three-meet schedule.
They’ll run against Penn State,
who beat them by one point last
year, on Oct. 8 in the opener.
Their other meets are with Navy
and \Vest Virginia.

Both coaches agreed that it the
team performs well, they’ll be en-
tered in the IC4A freshman cham-
pionship.
