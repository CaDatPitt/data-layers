Irene Frieze remembers 8. time

_ when female professors kept qui-

et about their involvement with
the Women’s Studies Program be-
cause it would keep them from
receiving tenure at the University.

Forty years after the establish-
ment of the program, Frieze, a
psychology professor, addressed

a room of about 30 people —— pro— .
‘ fessors, graduate students and
- guest speakers included — about

the early years of the Women’s
Studies Program. Frieze’s lecture
was one of six lectures and panels
addressing contemporary edu-
cation and gender studies that
Pitt’s Women’s Studies Program,
the second oldest in the -country

- after San Diego State University,

hosted in Posvar'Hall Friday. The
event served in part to celebrate
the pro gram’s 40th anniversary as
an established component of the
University. The celebration, also
comprised of events on Thursday,
included readings and musical
and dramatic performances.
“There were a lot of mixed
feelings about us,” said Frieze,
who moved to Pittsburgh to help

establish the Women’s Studies‘ -

Program in 1972. “Our priority
was to establish an academic pro-
gram.” A

‘Frieze noted that the main
challenge was getting Pitt to ac—
knowledge the program as part
of the academic world.

Gargani and his brothers were just
afew ofthe more than 3,000 Pitt stu-
dents who gathered at the William
Pitt Union at 10 am Saturday to take
part in Pitt Make a Difference Day,
an armual event that began in 2007
as a way to connect Pitt students to
the larger Pittsburgh community. The”
students boarded buses that lined Bi-
gelow Boulevard to travel to one of
the 63 volunteering sites throughout
Pittsburgh and surrounding areas.

Pitt students like to think that the ’

  

city is their campus. Now in its sixth .

year, Pitt Make a Difference Day con-
tinues to provide away for students to
help people throughout the city and
for Pittsburgh residents to bond as a
community. H . .
Michael Nites, a junior and indus-
trial engineering, math and econom-

ics major, was a bus captain for the '

event. Nites is also Allocations Chair
for the Student Government Board.

“It’s something different. I like it
because as an engineering student, it
provides a different perspective and
lets you give back to the community.‘
And it’s_ ﬁm meeting new people,”
Nites said.

“They were extremely grateful to

Gideon Bradshaw
Staff Writer

Last Fridayevening a group of ’

mostly college-aged adults drew
images of homes with crayons.
Once they had completed their
masterpieces, the group mem-
bers were instructed to tear up
their work.

The activity was part of the ﬁfth
annual Sleep-in for the Homeless,
of which Pitt was a lead sponsor.-
The event included activities de-
signed to raise awareness of the

complex problems faced by the

city’s.homeless population. Com-
munity Human Services Corpora-

" tion assists 1,500 homeless people

in the Pittsburgh area.
Jon Hoffmann, a development

specialist with Community Hu-
man Services Corporation" and '

the event’s organizer, noticed one
student in particular baring a hurt
expression on his face when or-
dered to tear up his work.

“It was clearly a very emotional
thing for him to spend a lot of time
thinking about what home meant

for him and then losing that,” Hoff- v

mann said.

In addition to hands-on activi-
ties, the event included a number
of speeches. Speakers at the event
included University Vice Chancel-

WOMEN _

As a professor of psychology as well as a
member of the Women’s Studies Program,
Frieze said that many ﬁelds, such as psy-
chology, do not recognize that women’s
studies can be incorporated into all_stud-
ies.

“We’re still battling that,” she said. -

Frieze also discussed the differences
in the way people perceive women’s stud-
ies today in comparison to the way they
viewed theﬁeld in its earlier years. Today,
the energy and excitement of establishing
a new program has died down.

“It’s a different kind of world,” Frieze
said, mentioning that today, men are in-
volved‘ with the program. “Everything is
evolving and changing.” '

In the early years of the program,
groups of graduate students would set up
courses in women’s studies because there
were few professors in the ﬁeld.

At the time, there was more of a com-
munity activist edge in setting up the
program, according to Frieze. However,
in order to gain academic credibility, the

group of graduate students and professors
soon set up proper courses. ’
After gaining acknowledgment from
the University, the program moved back to
its i:ommunity—like setting where women
could study gender issues and remain ac-
tive in ﬁghting for women’s rights. Ac-
cording to Frieze, this is helpful today as
students hope to connect their work in

other ﬁelds to the ﬁeld of women’s studies.

This adaptation also allows students to
study the aspects. of women’s studies that
focus more on activism. .

In the 40 years of its existence, Pitt’s
Women’s Studies Program has doubled its
course offerings and incorporated courses
that cover many of Pitt’s general education
requirements, according to Jean Ferguson
Carr, associate professorof English and
director of the Women’s Studies Program. '
The program nowoffers more than 100
courses across various disciplines.

_ “The access women students have to
things has changed dramatically,” Carr‘
said.

One panel consisting of lecturers from
the Women’s Studies Program focused on
“Pedagogy and the New Women’s Stud-
ies Classroom.” Panelists discussed their

. Program’s website.

courses and the advances the program has
made since its establishment.

Frayda Cohen, a Women’s Studies se-
nior lecturer, directed the Pitt in China
program last summer in which she worked
on relating women’s studies to the world.
Part of the challenge in getting students
to learn about women’s studies is relating
the classroom rhetoric to issues in the real
world, according to the panelists.

“There’s a lot of theoretical spillover,”
Cohen said of the academic aspects of the
program. The faculty works to give stu-
dents a different view on the structures
of power in other countries.

In addition to globalizing the Women’s
Studies Program in recent years, the fac-
ulty has also worked to incorporate tech-
nology into teaching. To bring home issues
in gender politics, many of the faculty use
a blog function on the Women’s Studies

“I found that bringing a blog into class
actually made students talk a lot more,”
Cohen said. ‘ _

Students use theblog to share links
about current events in women’s studies
and discuss the issues. According to Cohen,
the blog acts as an interactive medium,

bringing current issues affecting women
‘into the classroom. ’

Other panelists also created new ways
to foster communication among students.

In her Introduction to Women’s Stud-
ies course, Kimberly Creasap, a visiting
lecturer in the program, had her students
create zines — small pamphlets of self-
published work — for their reading and
writing assignments.

“They were perfect for issues that aren’t
really covered in academic literature,”
Creasap said. “The zines personalized
things that would theoretically go over
students’ heads.” 1 *

Such changes in the course materials
along with the expansion of the program
into ﬁelds such as law and health have
made the Women’s Studies Program suc-

> cessful, Carr said.

Although the program was established
40 years ago, Carr feelsthat there is still a
lot of excitement among the faculty.

f‘It was thrilling,” Carr said of the pro-
gram when it was ﬁrst created. “You felt
like you were doing something kind of
earth-shattering. But it’s like that now.
When I see the kinds of teaching that’s
going ‘on, it’s very exciting.” I

like your instructor to know.

PMADD

Lawrenceville that Saturday morning.

Courtney Benson, a freshman chemistry
major, spent her ﬁrst PMADD picking weeds
and cleaning out gardens.

“I’m super excited to bond with friends,”
Benson said.

Benson was joined by her friend and fellow
floormate, Marissa Badzik, afreshman and pre-
pharmacy major, who was equally excited to
travel to a new part of Pittsburgh. Badzik ex-
plained that she has done community service
in the past and hoped she would have ﬁin at
this event.

A member of the Triangle Fraternity, Colin
William, a senior and industrial engineering
major, was looking forward to revisiting Law-
renceville. This is William’s third time participat-
ing in PMADD, and his freshman year he spent
the day in Lawrenceville as well. He was joined
by 19 of his fraternity brothers.

They ﬁnished off their afternoon by walking
the red cobblestone streets of Lawrenceville,
picking up trash as they went along. They were
accompanied by the other members of the group
who split up to clean around the river and a lo-
cal park. . ‘

Mallampalli said PMADD was especially suc-
cessful this year because they made the event’s
start time an hour later — 10 a.m. instead of
9 a.m. as per the year before. This year’s event
saw almost 1,000 more students than last year.

David Beach, aﬁfth—yearsenior and chemical
engineering major, also agreed that the event
was better this year. Having attended the very
ﬁrst PMADD, Beach says that they were much
more organized this year and that the event has
really come a long way.

“Hanging and living around college students
is a challenge, so to say we actually do care about
our surroundings and the people we live around
is cool,” Beach said. V

Mallampalli said that she has been preparing
for this event since January, and it is her ﬁrst
year as the Community Outreach chair. Her goal
was to improve PMADD. She was extremely
proud of the hard work from her staff and all
the students, and she hopes PMADD continues
to improve armually.

“PMADD is truly a testament to how dedi-
cated to the community the students are,” Mal-
lampalli said. “And that’s not something every

University can say.” I

know a total for the funds the event brought
in, he said that more than $15,000 had been
raised as of last night, of which he said Pitt
donated $7,500. The ﬁnal ﬁgure would prob-
ably reach more than $20,000, Hoffmann
estimated. The money raised at the event,
which is the organization’s largest of the year,
would go to Community Human Service’s

Michael Caruso, a junior at Duquesne who
majors in business and marketing, was one
of about 10 students who came to the event
with the school’s chapter of Alpha Delta, a
service fraternity of which" he is a member.
Alpha Delta donated $50 to the event.

Caruso said that Duquesne’s location- near
the Hill District and the South Side has forced
him to witness the suffering of those who are
homeless or who struggle to afford housing.

“The quality of life just gets to you,” Ca-
ruso said.

He and the other members of Alpha Delta

said was donated by Eat‘n Park. Following
the dinner, attendees went to nearby Market

At about 8 p.m., Peduto addressed the
audience in regard to the factors that con-
tribute to homelessness, including mental
health issues and substance abuse. He re-
minded the audience that, especially during
severe weather, the city’s homeless often
resort to sleeping under bridges or wherever
else they can. T

“Some of them don’t wake up,” Peduto
said. “That’s the reality in this city every day.”

THE STAMATTACK

Bipartisanship is n

Nick Stamatakis
Assistant Opinions Editor

Many see Pittsburgh’s current
transformation from dirty steel
town to a model-mixed economy
as resulting from the plans of far-
sighted thinkers in the mid- century.

Two ﬁgures in particular, a Re-
publican and Democrat, teamed
up in the 1950s to clean up the‘ city.
Businessman Richard Mellon and
-Mayor David L. Lawrence joined
together, ‘putting aside partisan dif-
ferences to clean the air, modernize

‘infrastructure and create the seeds
of today’s diversiﬁed economy.

Everybody yearns for these days
again. We want Democrats and Re-
publicans to put aside partisan dif-
ferences and work together. End
the ugliness of arguments. End the
silly pursuits of short-lived politi-
cal victory. j T’

If only our modern political
leaders could work together in the
manner of Lawrence and Mellon,
we’d get a chance at solving some
of the big issues we face.

‘But before you get too nostalgic,

.- it’s important to point outthat these

far-sighted plarmers also nearly de-
stroyedthe city. While Point State
Park and the move toward cleaner
air were successes, the bipartisan
glow of the mid-century produced
dozens‘ of disastrous projects and
came close to producing dozens
more.

In fact, modern Pittsburgh is the
success it is today not because of
bipartisan long-term planning, but
because after the dramatic projects
of the 1960s, civic groups, budget

constraints and Pittsburgh geogra- V

phy- stopped more dramatic trans-
formations from allowing the bull-

dozing of large swaths of the city.

After all, city planners wanted
to do much more than revitalize
Allegheny Center, East Liberty and
the Lower Hill District — three
projects that devastated urban
communities. Had bipartisan ca-
maraderie won all, the" city would
be unrecognizable. -
V The Strip District, one of Pitts-
burgh’s greatest assets, would have
been packed up, with distributors
and warehouses forced to relocate
to McKees Rocks, just west of city
limits. In its place would be a 1960s-
style tower city development: a
sterile, and likely blighted, collec-
tion of towers set apart by parks.
Station Square would have met a
similar fate.

Highways would have ripped _

through some of the city’s great-

est neighborhoods. The proposed

Oakland Crosstown Freeway would
have sliced Lawrenceville, Oakland
and the South Side across the Bir-

mingham Bridge — bye bye, Tiki

Lounge. .

Buoyed by a network of high-
ways, Pittsburgh might have suf-
fered the fate of other Rust Belt
cities: a desolate urban core sur-
rounded by satellite cities.

This f_ate could be considered
the true effects of unmitigated bi-

‘ partisanship. When Republicans

and Democrats get together —4

or, as in more recent years, when

. Democrats rule unopposed —— good

things might happen, anddebates
might be more civil. But just as of-
ten, hubris can form, which pushes
out common sense and realistic ex-
pectations.

Today’s success, and its reason
for existing, brings us to the ’most
important lesson of the Pittsburgh

ot always a cure—all

experience: A strong and vocal civic
community is just as important as
bipartisanship. Beginning with the
Pittsburgh History and Landmarks
Foundation, co-founded by Arthur
Ziegler Jr. in 1964, civic groups in
the city have been some of the most
annoying in the nation, dutifully
challenging the city and Urban Re-
development Authority when it has
proposed to tear down half the city.
“In other words, you don’t want
things to work too well. In this
way, Pittsburgh was blessed with
its greatest asset: a collection of
hills and valleys unable to be easily
and cost-effectivelyconverted into
a network of highways. Relatedly,
the heavy industry in the area-had
no incentive for large road con-
struction, with rails and rivers be-
ing enough to move raw materials.

The bipartisan coalition was
thwarted by businesses and geogra-
phy. This is why Pittsburgh survived
a round of potentially disastrous
renewal projects.

So when you look at the national
landscape and see Republicans and
Democrats at each other’s throats,
with SuperPACs unleashed by Citi-
zens United spending millions to
inﬂuence elections, you might see
a lot of bad. This is somewhat justi-
ﬁed; a lot of arguments today are
meaningless rhetorical conﬂagra-
tions. . "

But if Pittsburghpis any guide,
all that messiness can at times be
better than blissful bipartisanship.
While we might want a more be-
nign, less messy political scene,
we shouldn’t just pretend a couple
of handshakes are all we need in
Washington and Harrisburg. I

Why I won’t be watching
the ‘debate tonight

Elizabeth Weisel ,

Columnist

The past three debates in this election
season have spawned endless discussion
and reﬂection. Opinions blew up Face-

’ book, Twitter and real—life living rooms.

’ But I didn’t watch them.
V Partly because my cable box still isn’t
hooked up, and I had jus_t gotten home

, from work when they each started, but

mostly because I didn’t want to. Don’t
get me wrong, I’m interested in politics
and follow what’s going on so that I can
be an informed voter. But when it comes

_ to getting information about the candi-

dates, I think the debates are the worst
place to turn. '

I used to watch the debates with in-
terest, attempting to analyze everything
that each candidate said to decide who I
wanted to support — even when I couldn’t

. vote. But after years of watching the de-

bates, I’ve realized‘ how pointless they
really are.

For one thing, the debates are full of
mere rhetoric. Questions are anticipated
and answers are written weeks before
the debates even begin: Even in the more
loose town hall format, candidates can

‘ mentallyplan their responses. And when

they do go off script, they use their words
to put whatever they’re saying in the best
possible light. if

As a viewer, you’re not necessarily get-
ting the truth, but instead, a collection
of buzzwords that turn into sound—bytes
that will inevitably Show up in campaign
ads for or against the candidates. -1 want
a candidate that can speak off-the—cuff
and truthfully delineate his or her ideas
for the presidency, not one who delivers

I rehearsed, tailor—rnade answers for the '

media. »

The candidates also talk strictly about
their “plans,” especially if they’re not
incumbents — plans to do this, plans
to do that. President Barack Obama’s
2008 campaign was all about his plans to
change our nation —_ four years.later and

even Obama supporters are complaining_

about the lack of change. In the debate,
presidential nominee Mitt Romney was all
about his plans to save our economy and
create jobs and solve all of our problems.

,Here’s the thing: Plans don’t work like
that. Candidates can have great ideas, but
they’re not going to actually know what
is and isn’t possible until they enter the
White House and realize how things re-
ally stand in our country. Plans are great‘,
but they’re not everything, especially in
a country where leadership isconstantly

4' ‘changing hands. .
There also isn’t any immediate ac-

countability for the candidates as they’re
debating. After the debates, there are
innumerable articles detailing things the
candidates said that are neither true nor
possible. It’s great that ‘the media holds
the candidates accountable for the facts,
but it doesn’t come until after the debate
—- Candy Crawley’s fact check last week
notwithstanding.

When I’m actually watching the debate,
how am I supposed to‘ know what to be—
lieve? I know afterward I’m going to ﬁnd
out there are things they said that weren’t
true, but if I don’t know until afterward,
what’s the point of even watching at all?

Despite all of this, if you watch the
debates, you are still likely going to ﬁlter
information through your own bias. We

are biased depending on our political af—'

ﬁliation, whether we know it or not, and

‘those biases often cause us to see only

the good in our candidate_and the bad
in the other.

Though the debates are a relatively
useless part of the presidential campaign,
there are plenty of other ways to learn
and become an informed voter.

There is no way to ﬁnd an unbiased
source of information, but you can try
to investigate both sides of each issue.
That way you’ll receive information from
both biases and can ﬁgure out where the
crossover and the truth is.

You can also pay more attention to the
other candidates in the election season
— the senators and congressmen and
mayors and your local politicians. The
president is onlyone man in our govern-
ment, and there are others who affect us
more directly.

Most of the legislation and government
actions that apply to us on a day-to—day

- basis happen on a local level, so those are

the candidates we should be intently re-
searching. The president does not control
most of the property taxes where you live;
your school board does. The president
can’t push through an impacting bill by

himself, but your State Representatives
-can help. These candidates serve essential

functions in our government.

Lastly, I encourage you to decide what
you_believe before you do any research:
Decide where you stand on issues based
on your own morals and principles and
adhere to those beliefs. Then it will be
easier to find candidates that share those
beliefs rather than trying to choose a side

basedpurely on the political rhetoric sur- 3

rounding the issue.

When you don’t have to engage in all
the debate surrounding the debates, you
can rest easy in your own decisions. I

BUFFALO, N.Y. — Kevin Harper
hasn’t performed to the best of his
ability this year. .

Coming into Saturday’s game,
the senior kicker had made 6—of—11
ﬁeld goal attempts on the season.

But Saturday, with the rain com-
ing down in all directions and the
wind at full force — hardly ideal
conditions for his craft — Harper
did his job for the Pitt football team,

‘making two crucial ﬁeld goals early
on as the Panthers (3-4, 0-3 Big East)
won a dull, lethargic affair against
the University at Buffalo (1-6, 0-3
MAC), 20-6. —

What was probably the evening’s
most entertaining moment didn’t
even come from the players.

Hoping to add some excitement
to a game completely devoid of it, a
pair of fans ran onto the ﬁeld mid-
way through the third quarter, forc-
ing stadium security and the police

*+«'ﬁ‘1to action, one of them evading

capture for several minutes.

But both before and after the
momentary drama, the Panthers —
like Harper -— simply did what was
asked of them, slogging out avictory
to end their two—game losing streak.

BUFFALO, N.Y. — With more than
half of the college football season

( ~3ompleted, it’s time to accept the

brutal truth: This Pitt football
team just isn’t very good.

Sure, the Panthers (3-4, 0-3 Big
East) held on to beat lowly Buffalo
(1-6, 0-3 MAC) on a wet, windy
Saturday afternoon at the Univer-

lgseity at Buffalo Stadium, 20-6.

But the conservative and slop-
py play of both teams made the
game hard to watch at times.

It didn’t take long for pro-
ceedings to settle into a tedious

SPORTS  

While Harper’s importance to
the team tends to get overlooked
because of his position, head coach
Paul Chryst said earlier this week
that Harper always has the potential
to carry the team with his perfor-

mance and that, despite his up-and- ,

down play this year, the coach still
hasconﬁdence in him.

“I told the guys, ‘There -is going
to come a time where we’re going to
need Kevin, and he’s going to deliver
for us,”’ Chryst said. “No one wants
to do better’ and make every ﬁeld
goal like Kevin, and as long as he
keeps working on it and going, then
that’s all you can really ask of him.”

Harper helped Pitt gain an early

lead in Saturday’s victory, scoring ‘

the ﬁrst six points of the game with
ﬁeld, goals of 45 and 22 yards.

Accompanying the early lead,
Pitt’s defense harassed the Bulls,
achieving its lowest-points-allowed
total this year. And touchdowns by
runningbacks Rushel Shell and Ray
Graham capped the scoring as the
Panthers earned their third victory
of the season. _

Redshirt junior linebacker Dan
Mason, who continues to work his
way back from abroken leg suffered
two years ago, started his ﬁrst game
since the injury and compiled 11
tackles to tie his career high.

H “This is what I’ve been working

for,” Mason said. “I had a hell of a

But for a team that has lacked
consistency itself, having a kicker
regain his mojo can’t hurt.

“We: needed that, andhe deliv-
ered,”~ Chryst said of Harper after

‘the game. “Now we’ve got to build
on that. He’s got to take that mo-

mentum [and] hopefully go forward
with it.”

That’s because the only

Panthers’ next drive with a

him this week, when they restart Big East play
against Temple next Saturday, Harper’s per-
formance could be crucial.

Despite the inclement conditions, the
kicker said his process didn’t change.

“You-kind of just get through your mind.
that it’s all the same: still same size goal posts, 2

same ball, same thing you were doing since you

were young,” he said. “You really can’t think
about it. You’ve just got to go through your
same routine as always.”

Harper also made a connection betweenhis
own struggles and those of the team: Criticism
from outside has forced them to self-motivate.

"‘When your stats aren’t that good, and
people are kind of getting on you, you kind
of just get your conﬁdence from within,” he
said. “[And] I think that’s true with our team
as well, not having the best record.” I

mediocre nature of this Pitt football season
should fall on the fact that this team is cur-
rently adjusting to its fourth head coach in
the past three seasons. V

No football team can change coaches so
frequently in such a short amount of time
and still expect to challenge prospective
teams for championships.

With the impending move to the Atlantic
Coast Conference, the Pitt football program
still has the potential to reach the heights
imagined by anticipating fans: competing
for conference and national titles on a con-
sistent basis.

But before it can do that, it needs to ﬁnd
something that can be extremely elusive in
college football.

It needs stability.

And stability takes time. I
