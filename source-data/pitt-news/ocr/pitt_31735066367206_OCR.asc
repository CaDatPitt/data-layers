Jazz Concert New Part.
 Of Annual Homecoming

A new system of bidding for ﬂoats and a jazz contest
are among the innovations forthis year’s Homecoming week-
end. The Weekend will begin October 15. .

The initial step, the bidding for ﬂoats, has been left to
the discretion of the individual fraternities. The system will
differ this year in that the individual fraternities will vote

    

THE UNIVERSITY or rrrrseuizon

among themselves as to Which?

sorority they will send a bid.

Sororities will then vote on the
bids they receive. This system
will mean that the. float parade,
which will definitely be held in
Forbes Field, will have at least
one less float than last year’s
total of nine. I , i

‘ Broadway Theme

The theme has been officially
announced as “Broadway Shows.”
The float-‘makers will be able to
use any aspect of any show, (title,
song,.characters) but must asso-

 ‘ciate it with Homecoming‘.

All bids for ﬂoats must be in

_ by Friday. Themes will be ac- ,

cepted no later than Sept. 28.
Two new additions this year

Twill be a Banner Contest and a

Jazz Contest. The former will be
held on Oct. 15. The banners,
made and submitted by the dor-
mitories, will be on display either
in Schenley Quadrangle or around

Seven Persons

Named to 1961
. Yearliook Staff

Heinrich Bonstvdi. editor of the

1961 Owl. has announced his edi—'

torial staff for the yearbook. Sev-
en new members of the editorial
board have been named, while the
positions of literary and layout
editors remain ' unfilled.

Don Reisch and Bill Schcnider,
members of the 1960 photography
staﬂ’, have been promoted to As-
sociate and Photographic Editors,
respectively. ~ ,

Cheerleader Judy Reynolds, last
years’ secretary to the Editor, has
become Senior Editor. She is also
a member of Delta Delta Delta
sorority.

Carol Sculli will be Office Man-—

ager, and Carol Mehalko takes
over as Organization Editor. Both
were on the 1960 staff, and in ad-

dition they are in Sigma Sigma‘

Sigma sorority.‘

A newcomer to the staff, Rich
Sobota, assumes the duties of Art
Editor; ‘Jack Smith, on loan from

the Pitt News sports staff, becomes -
Sports Editor. Smith is Production-

Editor of the Pitt‘ ‘News and a
broadcaster and sports director for
WPGH. '
Ben-stedt said that the Owl is
havingtcirculation problems this

year because of the new registra-V

tion plan. Formerly 70 per cent
of the sales were made at regis-
tration, ‘when students had to
stand in many lines. ,

Now with the direct mail sys-
tem, these lines have vanished.
Consequently, sales are down 500
per cent, as c0mpa1'ed~i0 last year
at this time. ~
lThe 1961 Owl will take the
same form as the l96O Owl with
the exception of a few changes in
layout and typography. Such
things as page numbers and cap-
tions will be blended for a better
graphic composition.

Editor Bonsteclt said, “At pre-
sent we. need some literary and
layout ,staff members, but I feel
sure this will be a good yearbook
with plenty of mood. We aim to
publish memories and capture
school spirit.”

sang sea clianties and bobbed for apples and played “Run,

Should 'proct;ors be armed? Should coeds go out for football’.-”!

My quota, to be sure, is not terribly difficult to attt-ain (it is,

it every single day. This may seem to you a grueling scliediile
but you must remember that some days are rela tively easy-

S    Saga Success.

The introduction of Saga" Food Service to the University
 hassmeant, better food and improved service forstudents.

i The food is warmer and better tasting than ever before.
The managers of Saga seem genuinely interested in the

 “food preferences of students and welcome their criticisms.

. « 'Morei variety in the meal is evident and the policy of

 s unlimited seconds to meal ticket students has been well

‘received, as have the Saturday evening steaks. Fewer
, choices are available at each meal for ‘meal ticket students,
it but the ‘better quality food imore than offsets this factor.
Some of the food service problems still remain, for which
Saga can certainly not beblamed. The long lines at critical
eating periods are annoying to resident students and can
only be corrected by the addition of more cafeteria facili-

\ ‘ ties’. s

The same cafeteria is now being used that was in serv-
7(ice three years ago for a much smaller number of resident

helped somewhat, but the fact remainsxthatl the cafeteria

is too small.

This cafeteria is overextended in serving the number of
students for lunch and dinner it presently ‘does. A hectic,
hurried meal, even with quality food, can be unpleasant.

V Students can do their part to help by providing the peak
' periods for lunch and dinner as Saga has requested. A
graph showing the minute by minute demand has been post-
ed by the food service outside the cafeteria.

, Sagaymust be congratulated for stepping into/,a difficult
situation and doing the excellent job they have.

,\>‘V_

By Ina Amdur _
At the end of one of William Saroyan’s plays

‘ is the line “something’s wrong somewhere.” Peo-

ple havecalled this realization by Various names.
Some have said that “there are tears at the heart
of things;” others have spoken about the “tragic
sense of life.” Everyone, at some time has had the
intimation that there is a cer-
tain incongruity, about the way
things occur in the world, a cer- 
tain mocking irrationality at the
heart of the universe. 
The only people who do not
seem to be conscious of this
tragic dimension are Hollywood
ﬁlm producers. Very rarely does

opportunity to see a ﬁlm show- 
ing nolfz character enmeshed in T
paradox s1=f‘fering greatly, and
thereby gaining deep insight about the human con-
dition. I

The closest that the producer in Hollywood
co 7" toward the creation of a tragic ﬁgure is
the mealy-mouthed “yes—man”.- who ﬁnally decides
to say “no” after having been in the company. for
twenty-ﬁve years, and who is consequently ﬁred.
One realizes that generalizations such as this one
are dangerous, and that the person «who makes
them can be accused of oversimplication. Yet the
majority of Hollywood ﬁlms do not exemply tragic
themes. This is not so of European ﬁlms. Numer-
ous foreign ﬁlms illustrate what is meant by the
phrase “something’s wrong somewhere.” “Bicycle
Thief,” an Italian movie, is one of them. ’

‘Transportation Needed

Ricci, the protagonist of the movie, needs a
bicycle for his job of bill—posting. In ‘order for
Ricci to get‘ this job, it is necessary that he and
his wife pawn their sheets. The money which they
receive for the sheets enables them to buy back
Ricci’s old bicycle. After he works for a day, his
bicycle is stolen. Ricci and. his small son walk
through the city hunting for the bicycle, and ﬁnally,
when Ricci thinks. he has found the thief, he can-
not prove his accusation.

Letters to

Garbage Discovered U350“

Something Wrong Somewhere

 

There is only one choice remaining for him, if
he doesn’t want to lose his job. He decides to steal
someone else’s bicycle. This is probably» the only
time that he has ever stolen, and the agony which
this decision causes him is unbearable. Finally,
Ricci asks his son to move away so that he won’t
see him steal the bicycle. He is apprehended about
ﬁve minutes after he has stolen it and subsequently
released due .to the leniency of the owner. In the
meantime his son has witnessed the theft, and he
has also seen his father cry. One knows that there
will never been the same relationship between
them again. The child is no longer a child. He has
seen too much injustice to remain .innocent.

Whether this movie can be called tragedy in

the classic sense is not relevant. One does know

that it embodies tragic themes, such as “human
suffering, human evil, and human greatness. In
doing so, it helps to illuminate the mystery of ‘the
world and the meaning of suﬁering. For an hour

‘ or two, the viewer gropes with the characters for

an answer to their dilemma, and is thereby grop-
ing for an answer to the collective dilemma of
humanity.,He does not ﬁnd the answer which he
seeks, but becausehe has attempted the quest, he
is wiser {when he leaves the theatre than when
he entered it. ’  '

The Hollywood Version

In a Hollywood treatment of the same situa-
tion, it is easy to imagine the appearance of a
mysterious unidentiﬁed man who would present
Ricci with a ten. gear powder blue bicycle, ac-
companied by an electric tricycle for junior. It is
not difficult to judge which version is a imor‘e_ade‘-
quate imitation of reality or.which movie makes

a more lasting impression on the audience.

_After having seen the Hollywood version, each
viewer would go home unchanged by anything he

has watched, satisﬁed by thejustice of the uni-

verse. However, the image of a weeping father
holding the hand of his weeping son is not so easy
to forget, and for a few days at least one lives with
the vague consciousness that there is something
wrong somewhere.

Sloppy ,and lnsinuating

Editor, The Pitt News:

All myths may be based on
facts, but I’m fairly certain that
the‘ facts rarely support
myth. The myth of the unicorn is
not quite supported by the fact
of the rhinocerbus; the imyth of
the sun being carried across the
heavens in a chariot is not quite
supported by the facts on the
revolution and rotation aspects
of the earth.

I’m sure any reader will real-
ize that all myths are convenient
ways to explain inconvenient oc-
curences; the myths evaporate
when a reasonably intelligent
person explores the situation.

The article, “The Facts About
Nixon,” written by Yeager and
LaRosa is a rather decent ex-
ample of the type of campaign
by inuendo and insinuation that
Mr. Nixon is being accused of in
this article.

(I will assume in discussing I

the article that the quotes used
are actual and should be credited
to whom they are credited. The
sloppy style in which the article
{is written rather questions the
credibility of, the whole article
though.) . ’
Certain things should have

 

t  his

the .

the  article with

(1) Was Mr. Voorhis a con-

i sistent voter of “the Moscow line

in Congress?” (If Vice-President
Nixon was entirely wrong in this
assertion, I think -the article
should have stated facts pro or
con here instead of insinuating
something.) ,

(2) Was Mr. Nixon responsible
for or did he. approve of the
anonymous telephone calls that
condemned Mr. Voorhis as a
"Communist of the reddest
kind.” (Yeager and La Rosa in-
sinuate that Mr. Nixon at least
consented to these calls; if there
are facts pro or con they should
bepresented, after all Mr. Nixon
is the one who is supposed to
run a campaign by inuendo and
iinsinuation, not writers of fact.)

(3) What is wrong with a
Philadelphia lawyer? (The arti-
cle of vast facts» rather seems
to insinuate that this is reason.

/enough to distrust a man and his

associates.)

(4) What is wrong with re-
presenting an alleged “Philadel-
phia rocheteer?” (I do think
each American isentitled to an
attorney of his ‘choice; as for re-
presenting a clothing manufac-

' turer I can see that this is very,

very wrong.) _
(5) Was Mr. Chotiner cited

for anything in the Congression- I

al investigation for influence-
peddling? (Here for another in-
stance is andlinsinuation without
deﬁnite facts being set forward.)

The rest of the article forges

"downward in the same sloppy

pace. The facts should also be
set forward concerning Helen C.
Douglas and Vito Marcantonio
and their respective voting re-
cords instead of the inuendo used

‘in the “Facts” About Nixon.”

One particularly interesting

piece of inuendo was the state-

A ‘ “failed to

terested enough in him to con-
tribute 100 to 500 dollars apiece
to the furtherance_of his political
career!’

Yeager and LaRosa are insin-

uating again —— insinuating that
it is inheritantly wrong to give

money to Mr. Nixonfor his poli-

tical career and that the business
men concerned had some bad,
bad, motives in doing so. I won-
der why certain select roups

 

x.

of leaders of the AFL- 10 are

interested enough in certain can-
didates to give their _union.’s
money of from 100,000 to 500,000

dollars for the furtherance of a —

candidate’s political career?

If I’m privileged to hear an
excuse from “the boys,” I don’t
want‘ to hear the cry of “Too
little space” to do a‘ thorough
article. " __

_ Facts count -— insinuations do
not! It doesn’t look ‘too well to
do exactly what one accuses an-
other of doing —- whether carry-
ing out a ‘campaign by insin-

uation and inuendo... or writing a

newspaper article. Whether one
considers it high or low, this
was the road Yeager and La-

 Lawrence  Weld

‘Sons and Lovers’ Film

Production

       

Rates Well

By WILLIAM BENNETT
, There are two ways in which a reviewer can approach
a ﬁlm adapted from a novel. He can go on for pages about
how much different than the novel said ﬁlm is, or how much
the ﬁlm suffers" from comparison. Or he can forget the novel,

and discuss the ﬁlm on its own

merits.

In the case of “Sons and Lovers,” I have chosen the lat-

ter approach, since this is, after¢
all, a film review. And in the
case of D. H.*Lawrence’s novel
versus Jerry.Wald’s film, any
comparison would take more space
than is available at present.

And let me say this to those
people for whom the expressions
“Hollywood Film” or “A Jerry
Wald Production” are inducements
to avoid the film; fear not.

C 2 Essay On Beauty

Except for an overly loud
soundtrack that bumps along in
the Wagnerian leitmotif style
(Paul tells Mother he is going to
visit his girl friend; the Anxiety,
Theme sounds on the drums)-
there is no evidence that either
term had anything to do with
the film. _, _

“Sons and Lovers” is a film in
the aesthetic sense of the word.
Montage, balance of composition,
closeup and distance shots, light
and shadow are all skillfully com-
bined throughout theiﬁlm‘, which

plays which most ﬁlms‘ usually
turn out to be. '

One particularly striking sec— ~
tion in this aspect is the mine
disaster. The rippling on the
pond which so forcefully tells
Paul of the explosion, the rapid
montage shots of the black—clad
Welsh women dashing to the
mine, the closeups of the stun-
ned miners; here is a minor es-
say on the beauty of the ﬁlm as
art.

“Sons and Lovers” is a ﬁlm that
could not be anything but black
and white. The use of color —- so
wisely refrained from by the gen-
erally garish Mr. Wald -- would

Casting First-Rate

Enough of Lawrence's magniﬁ-
cent’ dialogue is in the script to
keep it ﬁrst-rate. And the actors
are equal to the task. From Dean
Stockwell as the sensitive arche-
type of Lawrence himself to the
puffy Womens’ Rights Speaker,
there seems to be no miscasting.

‘They Weren't As
 Lucky This Year’
- Coach Barnes

By TED COLTON

  
 
 

Sports Editor
Standing‘ in the dressing room with a little smile on his

V face was UCLA Coach Bill Barnes.

winner of the Yogi race has taken a commanding lead.

r

the football players. —

~ the nation.

“The Panthers have a good football team. They are much
better than last year but they weren’t as lucky,” the Bruin
coach related Saturday.

If you were around the University last year you will re-
member that the Panthers, paced by now departed Quarter-
back Ivan Toncic, scored three touchdowns in the ﬁnal six
minutes to pull out a 25-21 victory.

Saturday night at the Coliseum the Bruins scored once
(with a little assistance) in the last minute and got anp8-7
victory. Coach Barnes was happy with the victory and had
no comment on the officiating.

“This was the one we were after,” shouted Don Vena,
Bruin end who was involved in the controversial sideline
pass. He insisted he wasn’t out of bounds. But I don’t think
he looked too closely.

Bill Kilmer, who was on the throwing end of the pass
stated, “This win was better than beating SC (Southern
California). Pitt had beaten us both times and after last
year we wanted this one.”

He continued: “We were in great shape. Pitt seemed to
tire in the last quarter and that is when we started rolling.

You people have a great team and should do all right even .

with that tough schedule.” _

The game is over, but it will be a long time before the
Panthers forget about the way they lost this one. This was
the ﬁrst time the Cats have played in California since i956
Without Eastern and VVestern referees.

111 1956 Pitt was playing California. At the end of the.
first half the Panthers had 85 yards of penalties against
them while the Golden Bears had none. Since then there
always have been three referees from the west and two
from the east. Saturday night they were all from the
west.

=l= >l= =l< >l= >l‘=

Besides the game, most of the trip was enjoyable. We left
Pittsburgh at 8 a.m. arrived in Los Angeles at 11:10 a.m.
(California time). The trip took six hours.

‘~ From the airport the team went straight to Disneyland.

Here the first ‘sight I, saw was the C—boys riding down old

main street in a horse drawn carriage. After a three-hour
Eur lof Disneyland, the team was taken to the Ambassador
ote .
This is the same hotel where Mr. Nikita K. stayed.
On Friday night the Panthers took in the USC-Oregon
State game. State, a 14. point underdog, upset Southern
California. '

Saturday morning the team went through a quick work-
out on the hotel lawn in front of the famous Cocoanut Grove.

Those of us who did not have to play that night spent the
day at the Ambassador’s Sun Club, swimming in the swank
pool.

After the disastrous Saturday night, the trip turned a
little on the unpleasant side. But to top it off, as the team was
nearing departure the assistant manager of the coffee shop
called Beano Cook, Pitt publicity director, and in a shaky
voice informed:

“The Pitt boys aren’t tipping. What are we going to do?”

I say send the tip bill to the referees.

The movies also backed up Pan-

call. After Kilmer’s next pass

Team Beats

Carnegie T.

“Not bad!” That was the
impression Coach “Bim-
bo” Cecconi expressed in his
usual stoic manner, follow-
ing a four touchdown drub-
bing of Carnegie Tech in a
kick — off — less scrimmage. His
freshman gridders were extremely

classing the Plaid varsity team,
despite the presence of ten letter-

impressive in

men. '
The Cat frosh looked eager to
gain starting berths and swarmed
all over
fumbled four times. Two com-
ments overheard on the enemy
sideline expressed their frustra-
tion. “We can't even get— one
crumby play off.”
“That’s their best offensive play.”
The offense, paced by the run-

ning of Richie Leeson and Pete

   
  

Billey, struck paydirt frequently
despite off-side penalties which

repeatedly cost them valuable
yardage. Q u a rte r b a c k Paul
Martha was nearly ﬂawless,

throwing sideline passes‘on the
dead run.

He threw one touchdown pass
and Billey, Ahlborn and Con-
way each scored once.

Ahlborn has since been switch-
ed to center. All-City back Joe
Gudenburr has been placed at a
guard position and quarterback
Steve Mizerak has been shifted to
end. Center Glen Martin moved
to tackle. ,

Line Coach Bob Pollock, an out-
standing tackle for the Panthers
a few years ago, thinks that his
linemen will be stealing the lime-
light from the backs with a little
more work. “They are inexperi-
enced now, but they’ll really
move once they play a regulation
game.”

,The freshmen have the highest
conﬁdence in their ability. Last
week one hollered, “If we played

defeated!" Such spirit win get its

Zanicopoulis ~ is another senior
and native of Pittsburgh. He is a
physical education major, and has’
lettered for the past two years. In
addition he plays catcher for the
varsity baseball team.

Zeke, as"’he is known to his _
team-mates, is a member of
Theta Chi fraternity. Last sea-
son he was ‘an all-American‘
goalie,’ and Coach Leo Bcmispis
hoping for- a repeat "performance
this fall. Zeke also never played
soccer before coming to the Uni-

Coach Bemis had a chance to see
the squad in action. in a, scrimmage
game against the Hazelwood Mag-
yars under the lights at Kennard
ﬁeld last ‘week. The Cats out-
hustled the Hazelwood team for a
4-0 victory.

Capitalize on Passing

Capitalizing on some fine fast-
break passing, the booters scored
twice in each half. Coach Bemis‘
substituted freely in order to see
all members of the team under
actual game conditions.

The first two goals were made
by sophomore Corky Cuthbert,_
playing at center forward. These
were setup by another sopho-
more Pete Smith, who is -not to
be confusedfwith Cal Smith.

Pete Smith is a_ fancy ball-

by Coach Bemis as ‘fperhaps the

tain Cal Smith, kept the ball
down on the Magyars’ side of
the ﬁeld for most of the game.

scrimmage was: George Harley

Smith and Bob Fiedler, insides;
Cuthbert, center forward; Ron

Use Hungarian System

The Cats use the Hungarian

system of deploying men on the‘

ﬁeld, as opposed to such other

in the.

-

systems as the American or British
methods. This resembles ‘footballs’
use of systems, for example split
T or single wing. .
In the Hungaria-nsystem three
fullbacks are employed instead
of the customary two. This
means there are only two half-
backs, which leaves the middle
of the ﬁeld less protected. How-
ever, the use of three fullbacks
gives a much stronger defense.
The halfbacks must hustle more
than ever since they play both
offense at all. times. But the three
fullbacks give opponents ﬁts, be-
;cause they are unaccustomed to
 this -system and have trouble pen-
ietrating deep into Panther terri-
tory.

Panther’s track and cross-
country history will ever7for-
get Arnie Sowell. Sowell,

was picked by Sport magazine
as the outstanding track athlete of

1958 and holds several Panther
records. A sophomore runner,
Harry Stokes, doesn't hope to

erase Sovvells memory or break
all his records. but he well might

{share the limelight when he com-
,_

‘_ iplctes his education here.

Both Sowell and Stokes didn‘t

, itravel far to come to the Univer-

tsity campus. They received their
thigh school diplomas from Schen-
'ley Public and it ‘was only a
short walk down the ‘hill from
Centre Avenue.

Stokes, a Liberal Arts student
who is going into engineering,

ﬁnals. ,

In his first year of cross-
country competition, Harry did
extremely well. He captured
first place in a triangular meet
with Navy and Georgetown. He
ﬁnished ﬁrst against the West
Virginia Mountaineers in his
second meet. In the ﬁnal meet
against Penn State, he placed
second.

Stokes trotted, over the ﬁnish
line ﬁfth, leading Pitt to a fourth
place ﬁnish, in the IC4A cham-
pionship. Coach Rees considered
that a real accomplishment in
view of the fact that Harry had
never run cross-country before
coming here. ‘

He‘ was an outstanding track

last season. He blazed the quar-
ter-mile in 47.5 seconds and was
timed in 1.51.2 in the half mile.
He is having diﬁiculty,” ex-
plaincd Rees, “with the addi-
tional distance involved in var-
sity competition. Last ycarhe
ran two and a half miles and‘
this year he’ll have to run be-
tween four and ﬁve miles.”

Rees expects Stokes to be equal
