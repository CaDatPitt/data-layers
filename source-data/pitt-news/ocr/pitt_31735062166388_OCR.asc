Important Second Polio

Inoculations StartToday

Today is the ﬁrst day in the second free inoculations of
polio vaccine for the University of Pittsburgh. The shots will
be distributed today, tomorrow, Friday and Saturday in the

Commons Room.

All those who received the first inoculation must receive
the second at this time for immunity against polio. Without

the second shot no guarantee can¢

be made against incidence of the
«disease. For this reason the ap-
pointment cards for this shot were
distributed at the last inoculation.
Transfers Eligible

Incoming freshmen and trans-

‘ fers~are also eligible for this shot
which will then be their first in-
oculation and must be followed by
a second from two to seven weeks
later, preferably after a lapse of

The same eligibility is extended

to anyone who has not taken ad-,

vantage of the first inoculations

but wishes to do so at this time.

The second shots must then be

arranged with their family phy-

Sicians.

'. No one will be permitted to be
inoculated without a yellow ap-
pointment card or proper iden-
tiﬁcation.

The polio Information Center
on the Fifth Avenue side of the
Commons Room is open. The tele-
phone extension is 7250.

Anyone who has lost an ap-
pointment card or wishes to ar-
range an appointment may do so
by calling or visiting the center.

Third Shot Given

Anyone who has received the
first two shots prior to the Pitt
program and wishes to receive
their third shot may do so at this
time providing proof of sufficient

time lapse between second and
third shots can be given.

Proposed Station

Circulates Petition

On March 24 Neal Goodman,
Bus. Ad. ’59, and Edward
Bernstein, C ’58, attended the
conference of the Empire Re-
gional Members of the Inter-
collegiate Broadcasting Sys-

tem at Union College, Schenectady,
N. Y.

The two representatives of
Alpha Phi Omega’s Radio Inquiry
Committee were sent to seek in-
formation about the possibilities
of obtaining a student-operated

M radio station at Pitt.

IBS is a link between college
radio stations all over the country.
It offers, among other things, a
“tape exchange” between the col-
lege stations.

Petitions are being passed
throughout the school this week
for student endorsement. The
petitions may be obtained from
members of the committee or at
the Student Desk.

In order for the petition to be
honored by IBS it must be signed
by at least one-third «of the un-
dergraduate student body.

In Pittsburgh there are two
other student operated‘ IBS sta-
tions, WDUQ at Duquesne Uni-
versity and WCIT at Carnegie
Tech. ‘

HOW wAs THE cRooK TOOK?

QUIMBY, WISC. (March 3).
Police today arrested the foul
felon who heisted the cash reg-
ister at Jones’ Gas Station.
When arrested, the base serv-
ant of the devil kept mutter- ,
mg, “Drat the shirt, drat the
shirt.”

Let’s look at the events
leading up to this story. After
the holdup, the police quizzed
Victim Jones. Jones couldn't
identify the yegg. "The wan-
ton jackdaw whocabbaged my
cash wore a mask,” said Jones.
"The only distinguishing fea-
ture about him was his shirt.
A beauty! The collar was ab-
solutely free of wrinkles. Oh,
he was a neat one!"

Meanwhile, the scoundrel,
knowing that his wrinkle-free
and enviably—neat collar was a
dead giveaway, tried desper-.

1

ately to slip some wrinkles into
it. He stamped on it with hob-
nail boots. He slugged away
at it with a club. But not a
wrinkle! So later, as he skulked
‘down Main Street, his shirt
was noticed, admiringly, bya
detective and he was arrested
lickety-split. Good work,
copper!

By now you will have
guessed that the miscreant
wore a Van Heusen Century’
Shirt. But of course! It’s the
only shirt in the world with the
soft collar that won’t wrinkle,
ever. It never needs starch,
so it's always comfortable. The
Van Heusen Century also lasts
up to twice as long as ordinary
shirts, yet costs no more. $4.00.

Arms Against 1' yrann y

A short time ago students in the University were speak-
ing of the need for positive action against the tyranny in
Hungary. Some even wished for-‘the opportunity to take
arms and ﬁght the_..oppressers themselves.

Others with less impulsiveness and more practical ideas
about ﬁghting tyranny started programs to aid the hard-
pressed ‘freedom loving people of Hungary.

‘One of these programs was undertaken by the Fresh-
man class. They decided to do something more than solic1t
money for relief funds. They proceeded on the assumption
that ‘the best way to accomplish the collection of an appro-
priate amount for, Hungarian relief was to offer something
worthwhile to contributors.

A talent show of students and faculty was decided upon
and adopted as a ﬁne way of accomplishing all these ends, -

and it carried the added advantage of further stimulating

lstudent-faculty relationships.

“At, ﬁrst, however, participation lagged, but as the idea

show boasts several unusual acts by both faculty and stu-

The performances range from music to ‘magic and are

as interesting as they are varied. The enthusiasm gener-

ated by the performers has carried a promise of a really
enjoyable evening. The show is scheduled for Stephen

The Colfax, Plan . . . r

Developing Potential     

By Millard Amdur

(Edttor’s Note—This is the second of two col-
mrms concerning programs for the mental.ly,su-
perior child.)

A unique,/ constructive program of enrichment
(providing within the framework of the curriculum
for the child) on the public school level exists at
Colfax Public School. The Workshop classes for
mentally superior pupils are under the direction
of nationally known authority on a typical children
and principal of the school, Dr. Hedwig O. Pregler.

The program provides an op- '
portunity for the mentally su- ,
perior to approach their potential
more closely. The only require-
ment for admission to the classes _
is an intelligence quotient of 135
or above on the Stanford-Benet A
standardized test. ‘

A The workshop has expanded
since the inception _, of the idea
twelve years ago tofour separate - .-
classes, the members of which spend half their

, class time at the acquisition of skills in the segre-

gated workshop classes and the other half with
hetergeneous groups of their ownchronological
age. ,

Equal Footing . .

During this portion of the day, Workshop chil-
dren will be more or less on equal footing with
the total group. At this time, the pupils are pre-
sented art, musiculibrary, “gymnasium, et al, sub-
jects in which the mentally superior are generally
no better off than anyone else. This equalization
aids in the partial elimination of resentment to-
wards the superior and egotism on their part. On
the other hand, the Workshop classes offer oppor-

'tunity for enriched development in academic sub-

jects,' not possiblewith, a heterogeneous group.
The Workshop program, ‘at the time I was in-

volved in it as a student, was divided into only

two sections, one for the ﬁrstthro-ugh third grades,

the other for.the fourth through sixth. As it is,

now, one section remains for the ﬁrst three’ grades,
but separate classes are utilized for the more spe-
cialized work of the fourth, ﬁfth, and sixth grades.
More freedom of activity is another basic change
that seems to have evolved in the program.

M On my visit last week to the fourth grade divi-
sion of the workshop, I was greeted by a veritable
hum of activity and culture. The exhuberance of
the students was catching, so interested were they

.in their diversiﬁed projects.

The students were primarily devoted to a crit-
ical Xstudy of-"ﬁve nations in various areas of the
World, the particular afternoon of my visit. They
were gathering material, delving into such mature
divisions of the topic as customs,, foods, geography,
national holidays, agriculture, and industry, to
mention a few.

Student Independence

What was most impressive about it was the in-
dependence of the students. They required little
from the teacher aside from her advice on occa-
sion. They subdivided the areas they wished to
consider themselves, arranged their committee work
on their own, and planned to prepare a mimeo-
graphed book, comprising the results of their re-
search. '

Furthermore, each committee was preparing a

On the Surface . . .

    

 

 

test for the whole class to take on the country of
its choice. Oral reports by each committee chairman
would be offered to the class, the book would be
available for future reference, and movies of the
lands studied were to be shown.

The competition among. the groups and individ-
ual children seemed intense, unlike any of these
children would ﬁnd in classrooms with students
of their own age, but not ability. Besides the type
of work already discussed, the children have spe-
cial interest work, individually done. I saw such
accomplishments as a scale model of the UN build-
ing, a crude, but workable, motion picture pro-
jector, and numerous investigative papers. -

One was entitled “Radio, The World at Our Fin-
gertips,” another, “Our Wondrous Desert.” The stor-
ies of the telephone and American Presidents were
written up. Other class projects.in a lighter, more
childish vein, include “Corny Cob,” a scarecrovw;
whose corner of the room the children rename with
the change of the seasons. The corner is currently
called, “Birds,” Blossoms, and Bees.” A horse named
Josephine also occupies an important spot in the
room and the hearts of the children.

I saw posted in the room lists of current topics
for speeches by the children. The speeches of the
individuals‘ are rated by the class rather than the
teacher on an excellent, good, fair, poor basis.

Unusual Quality

One further example of the unusual quality of
/the class appears in their study of the German,
language. Beginning in the ﬁrst grade this study
continues for six years. Dr. Pregler, who has done-
much of the coaching in German herself, stated
just as they learn English, as a conversational
language. No textbook is used and grammar is not
considered, yet some of the students are ﬂuent and
have developed sizable vocabularies.

When I was almember of the class, Spanish
was studied in the ﬁrst three years, French, the
second. At that time, however, textbooks and gram-
mar exercises were used along __with the study of
the spoken language. The curriculum, as may be
deduced from this alone is ﬂuid. The, Workshop is
not a panacea, yet it is a step ahead in the educa-
tion of one group. This segment, the upper 1% in
intelligence potential in the world, could be most

valuable to society, if allowedlto develop mag; 

fully.

-A

Perhaps some better system will eventuallyfai
come to the fore, but, for the present, we have in 9

the workshop a working experiment, certainly
worthy of educators’ careful appraisal. In the fu-
ture, a workshop-type program may be extended
to the secondary school level. Many in the Pitts-
burgh Public School System would favor such a
step. In the past few years, extensive study has
been made of steps taken to provide for the gifted
in the high schools of Philadelphia, Baltimore, and
other cities.

The ﬁrst graduates of the workshop will grad-
uate from college this year. A continual record is
kept of the progress of all the students. when some

correlation is -made as to effestiveness of the class ~'

educators will have more speciﬁc exidence of rela-
tive success or failure to guide them. The Colfax
Plan, unique, bold, and well-planned, is one about
which we may hear more in the coming years.

The co-au-
th 0 r s, Donald
Bevan and Ed- ~
mund Trzcinski, succeeded in
providing an evening full of
laughs and excitement in “Stalag
17.” The laughs could not be
easier or more slapstick. They
are probably a true part of
P.O.W. dormitory life. The la-
trine, the sexual hunger, the bad
food, and personal insults are

the essence of their humor; and

the fact that they are typical

American. men who‘ extend‘

themselves: to indulge in this
type of humoradds to the melo-

 

 

  

which
can be measured by the audi-
ence’s response. -
Source of Tension

The source of tension in
“Stalag 17” is the existence of
an informer among the young
American P.O.W.s. Before con-
tinuing,, let’s deﬁne the word
Stalag. This word is basically
German, being derived from
Stammlager, a camp for enlisted
men who became prisoners of
war. No one, of course, knows
which of them the informer is.
As goes without saying, the
wrong man, a rugged Bostonian
who is tough and sullen and
who nurses a grudge against life,
is the person held responsible
for the betrayal of the conﬁd-
ences and plans of escape which
invariably reach the Nazi offi-
cials. Sefton, the scapegoat, is
played admirably by Bob Ros-
borough around whom the play
is primarily based.
Reality of Play

The reality of this play de-
pends on the ability of the audi-
ence to believe what is happen-

ing and their desire, to project if
r themselves, into the situation. v

The reality is further supple-

mented by the vividness with
which Mr. Lloyd W. Welden, Jr.
has developed the settings, sug-
gesting the squalid discomfort
of a prison camp. ‘

The blunt humor is displayed
Very well ‘in the persons of
Harry Shapiro and Stosh, played

«by Nick Pranis and Don Mad-

zin, respectively. These two boys
are the grubbier of the inmates,
having been in camp the longest.
Pranis and Madzin, accompani-
ed by Chris Gillotti as Marko
and Norm Bloom as Herb Gor-
don, are superb clowns. Their
actions and lines have a‘ great
deal to do with carrying the at-
tention of the audience. The
seriousness of the play is sup-
ported by Nick Belich as Hoffy.

The accent of Corporal Shultz,
as played by Tom O’Leary, con-
tributed a foreign touch to the
play, but was occasionally a
bit weak. Heinrich Bonstedt,_,
who did an admirable job as the
German superior officer, sup-
ported O’Leary superbly.

From the standpoint of a Pitt
Players production, “Stalag 1'7”
was deﬁnitely a success, as was
apparent in the ‘ number of cur-

—-tain calls; ~  E

Peery Defends Laurels

By CHRIS GILLOTTI

Another feather will be added to the University and
Coach Rex Peery’s cap this weekend when Skyscraper U. plays

‘ host to the 27th annual National Collegiate Athletic Associa-

tion (NCAA) wrestling championships at the Memorial Field
House.

The opening eliminations begin Friday afternoon at 1
p.m. with four mats operating simultaneously. The quarter-ﬁnals
will be run off Friday night at 8 p.m. with the semi-ﬁnals starting
at 2 p.m. Saturday afternoon. The championship matches will com-
mence at 8 p.m. Saturday evening.

One of the feature attractions will be the challenge offered
Ed Peery. Peery, the defending 123-pound champion, will be out
to continue the family tradition of capturing three straight na-
tional crowns. His father-—Rex-—won the 118-pound title in
1933-34-35 while a student at Oklahoma A&M, and big brother
Hugh, now an assistant coach at the Naval Academy, won ‘the
115-pound section in 1952-53-54. Ed already hasltwo national
championships under his belt, but will meet the severest compe-
tition in his quest for a third.

Last season’s runner-up, Harmon Leslie of Oklahoma, will be
out to avenge his loss to Peery. The rugged Panther scored a last
minute reversal to upset him last year. As if Leslie weren’t enough,
Peery will also have to contend with Dick Mueller of Minnesota, the
Big Ten champ, and Lee Allen, the U. S. Olympic champion.

As his father and coach puts it, “Neither Hugh nor I ever faced
the competition Ed faces this year. It seems that this is a year when
the talent is centered in the lower weights.”

Along with Peery, a personality everyone will be watching is
the phenomenal Dan Hodge of Oklahoma. The muscular native
of Perry, Okla., who was upset in the ﬁnal seconds of the
Olympic ﬁnals, has pinned everyfoe but one in his collegiate
mat career, and is averaging 1 minute, 33 seconds per fall. The
177-pound class has been all but conceded, for as Coach Peery
puts it, “Hodge is in a class by himself.” _ _

The like of Hodge and his mates have made Oklahoma the team
favorite. Besides the undefeated 177 pounder, the Sooners boast
one of the three returning champions, heavyweight Gordon Roesler,
and a perfect season record, in- = -V  ;  =
cluding a 23-3 victory over arch-
rivals Oklahoma A&M, last year's
team champ.

With a record registration of
well over 260 wrestlers represent-
ing 64 schools, each weight class
will guarantee top—ﬂight wrest-
ling.

The 115-pound section will
probably be decided between
Pitt's Bill Hulings, the runner-
up to Terry McCann last year,
and Rich Delgado of Oklahoma, .
two-time Big Seven king, and DAN HODGE
third place holder in last year’s Oklahoma mat whiz
NCAA’s. A Panther victory in ‘

this class will mean a lot in their attempt at the team title. Dark

horses include Frank Altman of Iowa St. and John McHugh of

Maryland, both ‘of whom had draws with Hulings this season, and

Syracuse’s Ed Carlin, who upset him.

‘In the 130-pound division, the graduation of the Aggies great
Myron Roderick will make for a wild scramble among favorites Vic
DeFe1ice, the third place winner from 1956; Johnny Johnston of
Penn State, the Eastern kingpin; Bob Lyons of Oklahoma, the run-
ner-up from last season; and Max Pearson, the Big Ten champ from
Michigan.

Joe Gratto of Lehigh and John Pepe of ‘Penn State will prob-
ably do a repeat of their Eastern championship ﬁnal in the 137-pound
division. The Nittany Lion, who beat Gratto for the Eastern crown
two weeks ago, came in third last year while Gratto came in fourth.

all?
Included in the ﬁeld are Ted Bien-

kowski of Pitt, Paul Aubry of Ok-
lahoma, Ralph Wintermote of Wy-
oming, and Ralph Ricks of Iowa.

Ron Gray of Iowa St. is.
the favorite to succeed tough Ed
Eichelberger of Lehigh‘ as the
157-pound titlist.

In last year’s 157-pound elimi-
nations, Mike Rodriguez of Michi-
gan was a heavy favorite, pinning
his ﬁrst two opponents, but Was
forced to withdraw because of a
knee injury. He will be back this
time to try again, but will have
to get by tough Dave Johnson,
the Eastern champ from Sky-
scraper U.

The ﬁrst four place holders in
the 167-pound class are missing,
and so it will be a scramble to
decide who will wear Panther Ed
DeWitt’s crown. The experts fig-
ure it to be a race between Rex
Edgar of Oklahoma, Ken Kroft of
Northwestern, the Big Ten champ,
John Marchello of Michigan, and
Frank Powell of Iowa St. If
Panther Tom Alberts, out for a
month, can whip himself into
shape in time, he will present a
formidable threat to this quartet.

For some strange reason,
Hodge has not frightened away
all competition, for 32 grap-
plers have registered for the
177 - pound class.

In the 191-pound class, local
Ron Schirf is considered the fav-
orite. The big senior from Latrobe
ﬁnished third in the NCAA’s last
season, and won the Eastern
crown this year.

Sooners are favorites, he refuses v

to give up hope. He feels that
both Pitt and Penn State have a
chance. “No, we haven’t given
up,” states the man who put Pitts-
burgh on the wrestling map. “In
fact, if we get the breaks, we
have a chance to take the whole
works.”

As Weather Gives
Gridders Reprieve

Old man weather ﬁnally
moved in from the Panhandle
to give the Panthers their ﬁrst
break from spring training
this past Monday afternoon.

Coach John Michelosen hesi-
tated calling off practice for 30
minutes in hopes that the weather
might break and give his gridders
a chance to practice.

Finally, with no let up in
sight, the head mentor called in
Chuck Brueckman and Jim Mc-
Cusker, the co-captains, to re-
lay the no practice news to the
rest of the squad.

For candidates that needed help
on offensive and defensive plays,
the coaching staff made them-
selves available after the an-
nouncement.

Although practice sessions re-
sumed Tuesday, the team must
conclude practice on Thursday to
pave the -way for the NCAA
wrestling championships to be
held at the Field House on Fri-
day and Saturday.

Sports Success t ..

By MURRAY CHASS
Sports Writer

 
 

At many schools throughout the country interfraternity
competition plays a major part in the athletic life of those
boys who are not able to make the varsity and who belong
to fraternities. If this segment of sports at Pitt has ever been
given a much-needed boost, ithas been this year. Just who

deserves the credit for this pick—up in interfraternity rivalry
is questionable. -

It all depends whom you talk to. Both the director of Pitt intra-
mural athletics, Leo Bemis, and fraternity advisor Don Milletary claim
that it has been through the hard and outstanding work of Bob
Richardson, IF athletic chairman, that the program has experienced
so much success.

Concerning Richardson’s endeavor to increase the competi-
tion in the various leagues and tournaments, Bemis says, “Richard-
son has done a good job as chairman. Through his program, the
problems that usually crop up every year have been kept at a
minimum.” Bemis and Milletary both feel that Richardson's most
important accomplishment was the publishing of the “Inter-
fraternity Sports Manager’s Handbook,” a collection of rules
concerning elegibility, forfeits, equipment, etc., and a detailed
program set up for the entire year.

After being appointed to the chairman’s post last Sping, Richard-
son, acting on a suggestion by Bemis, went through the IM rule book
and incorporated the essential measures into his proposed IF plan.
Then he presented it to the overall Council and it was passed. The
schedule included in this handbook has been followed to the prover-
bial “T” thus far.

Starting in early Fall with
touch football, in which 15 fra-
ternities competed and which
title Phi Epsilon Pi won, the
IF program has gone through
seven sports, wrestling and bas-
ketball being the latest to be
ﬁnished. Everyone commected
with the IF sports was full of
praise for the fraternities for
their participation in the mat
tournament. Twelve teams en-
tered a total of 85 grapplers in
the March 11, 12. tourney, which
was won by Sigma Chi.

Sigma Chi also captured the
basketball title, coming out on top
of 15 other squads.

Of the four remaining cham-
pionships won, Phi Ep was vic-
torious in two of them. The PEP
athletes captured trophies in bad-
minton and squash, sports in
which eight teams each entered.
Pi Kappa Alpha beat out ten other
teams for the volleyball title, and
Pi Lambda Phi took the bowling
crown.

Getting back to who deserves
the credit, Richardson has his own
ideas. “I feel that the members
of the managers’ board are the
real reason for the success,” he
states. The IF athletic chairman
also expresses his feelings about
IF sports in general: “IF sports
are probably one of the most im-
portant aspects in integrating the
fraternities. If the spirit of the
idea is upheld and the fraterni-
ties don’t get trophy-happy, it will
remain a good program.”

Lewis

Whereas last year Lewis had to

depend mostly on Ronnie Moog,

 

the big rightl'iander, this season
he will be able to call on quite a
few more flingers. Of course,

Moog, captain of the Panthers,;

will once again be Lewis’ ace.

In reserve there will be three
returnees - Carl Lindstrom, Bill
Gilmore, and John Mirabelli ——
and newcomers John Riechen-
bach, Bill Hamilton, and Al
Leonard, the lone southpaw.

Lewis thinks that the year of
experience that the ﬁrst trio ac-

quired in 1956 also will be of
great help. ’
Probably the biggest loss,

from the standpoint of defense,
is the departure of catcher Tom
