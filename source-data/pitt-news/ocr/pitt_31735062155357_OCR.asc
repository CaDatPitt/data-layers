Inaugural Activities
Viewed by Students

_ By JACK! KATZ

Thirty-seven foreign and American students attended
Wednesday’s Presidential Inauguration and Inaugural Pa-
-rade under the auspices of the International Student’s Or-
ganization.

After viewing the Inauguration from the front of the
Capitol, the group had grandstand tickets for the Inaugural
Parade. The tickets were procurred through the co-operation
of the Office of Cultural and Educational Exchange (OCEE).

“Theforeign students received very favorable treatment by the
Washington crowd,” Sky Houser, co-chairman of the organization,
said. “In fact my pco-chairman
(Suresh Pradham from India) got
.a front row place for the group
during the Inauguration itself
when he told one of the guards.
that he and his friends had come
from 14,000 miles away just to
see it.” »

Houser explained

Elene Hoffman, commented that
she enjoyed the trip very much.
‘Miss Hoffman, graduate student
in political -science, lived in Wash-
ington for four months this sum-
mer and she takes every possible
opportunity to see Washington
again.

“The inauguration was very in-
teresting,” Miss Hoffman said. “I
didn’t see the ceremony very well
because there were so many peo-
ple, but it was beautiful.

“I thought the parade would be
a military parade, but it had
everything. I liked seeing the mil-
itary bands from the high schools
and universities and the ﬂoats
were really very nice. I’m not
used to seeing anything so spec-
tacular,” Miss Hoffman continued.

Piersall Tells
Of Recovery  
For Midday s

Jim Piersall, Los Angeles
outf'ielder,’will present “The
Jim Piersall Story” in Wed-
nesday’s Midday Series pro-
gram at noon in the Student
Union Ballroom.

Piersall, a major league can-
didate for “Comeback Player of
the Year,” has played with the
Angels since the second half of
the 1963 season. He played his
ﬁrst half with Washington and
the New York Mets.

That year he 
played only 20 
games with Lo
Angeles and bat
ted .308. The
leg injury that
hampered him
in 1963 gave 
him no trouble
in 1964, when

he batted .314.

   
   

 

HERSALL
He has played errorless baseball

for the last two seasons.

Piersall ﬁrst broke into profes-
sional baseball in 1948 at Scran-
ton. He later played at Boston

and Cleveland, receiving the

. American League’s “Gold Glove”

ﬁelding award 1958 through 1961.

Piersall has also earned a rep-
utation as a writer. His book,
Fear Strikes Out, written several
years ago, is an account of his
recovery from a severe nervous
breakdown which occurred more
than ten years ago. He has also
contributed to Life Magazine and
other periodicals.

(EFI) spoke to a conference of administrators and student
leaders Thursday in the office of Dr. Alan Rankin, vice-
chancellor of student and general affairs, presenting the

framework of his ﬁrm’s tuition
plan.

Logan explained the mecha-
nisms of interest rates, interest
payment and insurance coverage
in EFI and other loan programs.
Paraphrasing sociologist David
Reisman, he commented that peo-
ple .are traditionally oriented to-
ward a six per cent interestrate
on loans, This rate, he explained
is deceiving. -

Because of the intricacies o
computing interest payments, a
simple six per cent interest loan
in actuality becomes 12 per cent
total payment. When insurance
and service charges are added in,
the total premium becomes far
larger than the surface ﬁgures
would indicate.

Logan demonstrated through
charts and other visual aids that,
the EFI program has no hidden
costs. Its stated premium is all-
inclusive, and EFI program prom-
ises better insurance coverage,
longer repayment ‘periods and
lower all-around premiums than
the Tuition Plan, Inc. program.

If the University adopts the
EFI program, loan plans will be
open to parents of all University
students without investigation.
There will be no cancellation
charge for contracts that are can-
celled and no penalty charge.
Cancelled contracts can be re-
written at any time.

University Obse rvatory
Faces Slow Shutdown

While Director Objects

_ By AL JANEZIC ‘
The University is considering a money-saving shutdown

of its world-famous Allegheny Observatory in Riverview.

Park against the protests of its observatory director. If
the plan .-is carried through, operations at the observatory
will be eventually phased out, though not completely closed
anytime in the near future.

In making the announcement last Friday, Chancellor 0

Edward H. Litchﬁeld said the move was necessary because
of changing technologies. “The program there will be reduced while
the University re-evaluates its plans for astronomy research with an
eye to keying it more closing to the fast-evolving needs to space re-
searc ,” he said.

“Compared to our facilities and programs in space science and
technology, the observatory, in its present state, is outmoded. The
present equipment has long been obsolete. The University no longer
can justify the expense of keeping it in operation, particularly since
the contributions we hope to make in this ﬁeld of study cannot be
adequately brought to fruition with the present installation.”

But Dr. Nicholas Wagman, observatory director since 1941, dis-‘

agrees. “The observatory is the best in the world for its purpose,” he
said. “It is still the ﬁnest of its kind and the results from it are still

the best.” He noted that the observatory is known in professional I
astronomy circles for “setting the standards for the world” in stellar *

measurement. .
Dr. Wagman was qouted in The Pittsburgh Press as saying that
the reason for the threat‘ to the observatory’s operation is “the busi-

ness attitude oi; Litchﬁeld andohis deans. What we need,” said Dr. ‘

Wagman, “is .a’friend on the board of trustees (which informed him
of the impending closure).We haven’t got one now.”

“It seems almost criminal,” he complained. “Why our yearly bud.
get is only $50,000.”

During the past year, a number of astronomers have evaluated
the observatory’s program. One told the administration that equipment

thereis “old and weak and situated in a very poor location for ob- *

servations, either optical or radio.” '

Dr. David Halliday, dean of the division of natural sciences and
acting coordinator of the Space Research Center, said the observa-
tory has “outlived its usefulness.”

Dr. Wagman, however, took exception to both men’s views and
termed the charges “misinformation.” The observatory" he said,
“is not obsolete and it’s not weak.”

He said that his views and the chancellor’s are “J'llst‘the omin-
site.” He has ‘orientated it toward space research,” said Dr. Wag-
man, “where our objective is not toward space but to do fundamental

astronomical research, such as the studying of where the stars are.» .«

Tine Allegheny Observatory was a gift to the University from
the citizens of Pittsburgh in 1912, Its purpose, said Dr. Wagman, was

‘Ideas and Figures’

 

~ By MARTHA FRY _

In that very small part of
the University community
which follows ‘the campus
literary magazine, the latest
issue of Ideas‘ and Figures is
the most breathlessly await-

ed inyears. It.-is’ the ﬁrst

and only issue to‘ be put out by

a talented writer andc'ontrover-

sial editor—Ronald Caplan.
Despite the fact that he has

i been published in three previous

issues of the magazine, Ron Cap-
lan has been continually at odds

withI&F.—

He seemed to feel that the I&F
staff was a stuffy, play-it-safe edi-

Ntorial hegemony, and that it was
‘time to throw the rascals out.

L ‘He got the ear and support of
Director of Student Publications,
Irving Rothman, and last April
was steamrollered into office on
a “mainstream of modern poe-
try” platform. He then seems to
have tapped a small rivulet that
gushes through the ﬁrst booth in
the Tuck Shop.

It has the sticky-ﬁngered look
of a little boy turned loose in a

black) and a fold-around-flap on
the cover. Everybody knows that
too many goodies all at once
make you sick to your stomach.

Unfortunately, ‘though he pick-
ed up some of the ﬂourishes of
his predecessors, Ron failed to
learn from their editorial style:
the wit and poise of Susana
Downie’s issues, the loving care
of Ed Roberson-’s, the breadth of
Jeff Raékham’s. .

The magazine is probably a dis-
appointment to everyone: a dis-
appointment to Ron’s detractors
because it isn’t a complete ﬁasco
— instead it is an interestingly
experimental magazine, compar-
able to other issues of I & b F;
and a disappointment to his sup-
porters because it is just that,
and nothing more. Perhaps .a lit-
tle better than average — about
half the contributors are grad-
uate students. But it is clumsy in
common, amateur ways: naive
typography, slapdash composition
of the magazine as a whole (the
nu'de photo opposite “training to,
be champion” is an obvious ex-
ample), an infatuation with ir-
relevant graphic effects, and of
course, a sophomoric narrowness
of material.

Two unusual elements of a
magazine which have been known
to cause editors trouble and in-
convenience in the past have
been efficiently eliminated by
Ron—page numbers and a. table

His statement was in response to a remark made by
Dr. Edward Eddy, Jr., president of Chatham College, who

' commented that a low-cost, four-year state university is one

of Pittsburgh's most urgent needs.

Dr. Eddy added that Penn State
should establish campuses in
both Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.
He emphasized that the current
talk about community colleges is
deceptive in the respect that po-
tential students mistakenly be-
lieve that all educational needs
in the area would be ﬁlled by
this type of school.

All the college presidents in
this area were asked to comment
on Dean Eddy’s ideas, with re-
sponses ranging from Dr. Walk-
er’s affirmative statement to
Chancellor Edward Litchﬁeld’s
reply" of “no comment.”

“My views on the subject have
been expressed many times,” Dr.
Litchﬁeld said. “I see no reason

Dr. Litchﬁeld had previously

SG Resolution Sparks Student Opinion

(This is the first in a series
of articles about academic in-
tegrity at the university.)
By FRED FRANK
How-much cheating is
there at the University?
What forms does it take?
Will the resolution passed
by Student Government ask-
ing the University to take .a ﬁrm
stand on the matter have any
effect on the amount of cheating?

These questions were put .to
three dozen students in a ran—
dom interview conducted at places
such as the Tuck Shop and the
Towers snack bar. They agreed
that there is a great deal of
cheating both in and outside the
classroom, although they suggest-
ed varied solutions for the prob-
lem.

Many ‘students interviewed
were not even aware that SG had
passed a resolution concerning
academic integrity. Those who
did know of the resolution did
not see it as an answer to the
problem. Although most spoke
freely about the subject, prac-
tically none were wining to give
their names. .

_> Is there cheating in the class
room? What forms does it take?

—Co-ed freshman, School of
Liberal Arts: “There’s an above
average amount in classrooms.
Mostly it’s comparison (looking
at another student’s paper) .” ‘

—Co-ed sophomore, School of
Liberal Arts: “There's an awful
lot. Mostly crib sheets in science
classes where a lot of memoriz-
ing is required for the test. You
name it and I’ve seen it-—kids

, with books open on the.ﬁoor and -

notebooks open during essay
tests.”

—John Vrana, president of the
Student Government: “Cheating
.m0Stly goes on in the lower level
courses. There is a good percen-
tage in the distribution of studies
00|1l'SeS. where a student is re-
quired to take a certain course.
There is less in upperclass courses
because the student is taking
courses that he wants. I feel there
is a correlation between interest
and degree of cheating.”

>What kind of cheating goes
on outside the classroom? S

‘—Co-ed freshman, School of
Liberal Arts: Mostly looking at a
test from previous years, if you
Want to call that cheating. I’ve

never heard of anyone being paid
to write a paper, but I have heard
of two kids being paid to take
tests for kids}?

—-Male freshman, School of
Liberal Arts: “There’s plenty of
looking at test from past years.
Kids copy English themes from
past yars. Sometimes a few
words are changed, butvmost of
the time they leave it straight.”
Although mpst students said they
never heard of anyone being paid
to write papers, others pointed

out that the practice does exist

at the University.

-—'Co-ed sophomore, School of

' Liberal Arts: “I wrote a paper

once for another kid. He paid me
$5. Sometimes it’s a penny a
word or sometimes $5 for a ﬁve
to seven page paper.”

one in my English class offered
me $5 to write a paper for him.
I refused. I really 'don’t know
why.”

_It is not often that one is
tempted to write to a periodical
of any kind in order to praise
it. Since this is one of those oc-
casions, the strength of my feel-
ings-—and those of others, I am
sure-—concerning the notice given

by The. Pitt News to the perform- '

ance of pianist Van. Clibum with
the Pittsburgh Symphony Orches-
‘tra will be obvious.

Let me be blunt about it. In
my opinion, Van Cliburn is not a
gﬁrst "rank pianist. I think the peo-
ple who run the Orchestra know

I ' S  But it is equally plain that

Mr. Clibum is the best box office

the Pittsburgh Symphony has

Gym Facilities
Called Lacking

Editor, The Pitt News:

Although the fundamental pur-
pose of a University is the de-
velopment of the intellect we
also feel that the total quality
of the‘ body is essential. To date,
the University has overlooked
the students needs for recreation-
al facilities. The Field House is
rarely available; the stadium
gyms areiclosed more -often than
open; and the hours at which fa-
cilities are available are far too
short and ‘inconvenient.

Supposedly, the new intramur-
al building is being constructed
to cope with this problem. The
fact remains, however, that this
facility could also fall far short
of its goals unless adequate con-
sideration is given to the stu-

- dent’s needs.

Merely constructing a multi-

I a million dollar building will not

,alleviate the problem. Thus, it is

P ‘our hope that this new facility
‘ will be for the students and that-

those persons responsible for
scheduling the hours that this
building will be made available
will take into consideration the
seemingly little known fact that
students do have classes during
weeks days and that the time for
recereation is in the evening and

particularly on the weekends.

Mortar Boards
Makes Request

Editor, The Pitt News:

One of the problems that Pitt’s
present Mortar Board chapter has
discussed at several recent meet-
ings is the lack, of information
on campus concerning various
special scholastic programs which
the‘ University offers. In particu-
lar we believe that most stu-
dents have little knowledge about
upperclassmen honors programs
and the Special Fellowship Pro-
gram.

To help remedy this situation
we would like The Pitt News to
print an article or series of arti-
cles concerning these policies. We
are especially interested in learn-
ing the purposes of such pro-
grams, what each entails, the
entrance requirements and the
degree of success that each has
had. It may prove interesting to
interview participants in each

program in order to gain further
insight.

At a university that is grow-
ing and in transition it is_‘under-
standable that programs of this
type may not be known to the
student body in general. How-
ever, as Pitt grows and changes
such programs can only become
more crucial as we strive for
academic excellence.

A New  i ‘

Trimester Examined

 by Joel Beeler .

“A university education is successful when it stimulates
an expanding intellectual curiosity. A lifetime characterized
by activity of thought and -its application is the mark of
an educated man.”

. The above quote is from the ﬁrst page of the liberal arts
catalogue of the University of Pittsburgh for 1964-65. The
university IS a place to get a degree. It is not a place to
stimulate expanding intellectual curiosity. Why? The larg-
est single reason is the etrimester calendar.

. . ' p The trmister turns a vast learning

' institution into a vast factory. Stu-
dents become the product, and the
faculty ‘becomes the assembly line.
Consider theaver-age student taking .
6 about ﬁfteencredits. He has courses
. which have mid - terms and ﬁnals,

‘ courses which have three exams, even
 _ courses which have four exams. ' He
” i also probably has three or four term
 papers to write. Since the trimester
lasts only 15 weeks he ﬁnds himself
having a major exam almost every

Ell?-‘I-EB week or two. He also has classes to
attend. Every time he has an exam he gets behind in all
of his courses. _

The result is that instead of the student really having
time to think about anything he is learning, a necessary
prerequisite to intellectual stimulation, he spends the whole
15 weeks craming for exams and writing term papers. He
ﬁnishes the trimester with :15 more credits -added to his
transcript, that is all. At best he feels like a rat who has
just run a 15 week maze; he receives his reward in the form
of white envelope with a green slip of paper in it, and then
a weeklater he begins running another maze.

What has the student gained besides the credits? Has
he had time to think about his courses, to assimilate what
he learns, to draw parallels comparisons and contrasts? Has
he had time to do any outside study or reading that interests
him? Has he even had time to do all the assigned reading
for his courses ? The answer to all of these questions is “no.”

Should the trimester system be scrapped? It has bene-
ﬁts such as graduation in two- and two-third years for those
who want -it and can stand the strain. The beneﬁts to the
three- and one-half month summer vacation and the head-
ache free Christmas recess can -also “be sighted. The scrap-
ping of it is also a ﬁnancial impracticality for the University.
The physical plant is used all year‘ round under the trimster.
It would lay dormant for three months under the semester
system. That would be bad business, and the University
as we all know is a business.

Should the trimester be scrapped? No, scrapping it.
would be impractical. Instead, why not alter it in such a
way so that all it’s benefits can be saved and a lot more
added. The one specific benefit which can be added. is the
adherenc to the original goal of the university —— intellec-
tual stmulation. ‘ '

One way this could be done is by the changing of the
class hour distribution within the 15 weeks. In the present
system three credit courses meet three times a week for 14
weeks, about 40 times. Why not have the courses meet ﬁve
times a week for the ﬁrst eight.weeks -and then not at all for
the next six. The last week of the trimester would again be
devoted to exams. The three credit courses are a convenient
example, the other course also could undoubtedly be sched-
uled for eight weeks. . '

The beneﬁts of this system are obvious. In the last six
weeks the student would have the time to write his papers, ,
do his reading and assimilate the lecture material with his‘
own study. The six weeks would offer time for the student
to view the course and -his study as a unified whole. He has
no time .to do this under the present system. ‘He is too busy
with exams and papers to think about anything and he still

 

has to ﬁnd time to attend classes right up until ﬁnals.

But most important the six weeks would give the stu-

,'dent time to think about what he has learned. In that time

he would be able to give vent tq any-..inte1lectua1 curiosity
which his courses have aroused.”“"For“a while, at least, the
rat would be released fromthe maze, for six weeks he
would have no classes, no exams. Study would be given back

. to the student. -Under this system Pitt would stimulate ex-

panding intellectual curiosity, it could create the “educated
man.” Under trimester it never will.

(Last of a two-part review)
By PETE HORN

Last time We dealt indi-
vidually with most of the es-
says in Beyond the Edge of
Certainty. We shall now con-
sider the ﬁnal essay and add

pages, including 180 footnotes)
work of Paul K. Eeyerabend. Fey-
erabend’s mission.is to construct

a" 20th century Areopagitica 9
wherein he can promote a plural-J‘

ism of ideas. He tries to convince
his readers that philosophy, sci-
ence, and knowledge in general
progress throughtthe process of
clashes between contradictory
theories. A tentative, hypothesiz-
ed “theory” (i.e., “any sufficient-
lygeneral point of View concern-
ing matter of fact”) is for him su-
perior to a dogmatically defend-
ed doctrine. Any knowledge is
merely, in effect, a stage of an

L eventual higher-level, though “in-

consistent,” theory-to-be.
Feyerabend recommends a
healthy procedure and supports
it with convincing arguments. In
addition, he brings to bear a

V variety of devastating attacks up-

on those whom he calls “radical
empiricists.”

At times, he confuses who is
conserving what. If neither the
language nor the content of a
theory should be retained through
ﬂux, how do we know to what
we refer? After all, his program

would have all notions of what .

this year, Feyerabend’s stand —
disclaimers notwithstanding —
amounts in many respects to a
relativism.

When his playwright friend
Bertold Brecht employs “alterna-
tives” on the stage, it is to dem-
onstrate the subjectivity of per-
sonal experiences. But science
seeks more than that. Moreover,
even the relativistic art form
gains credence when some “core”
is agreed upon by the alternative
conceptions of a situation. Sci-
ence cannot, therefore, have a
Browningesque relativism" as its
supreme regulative principle.

It is only fair to note that an
important portion of Feyera-
bend’s View relies on his “prag-

' matic theory of observation.” I

found that segment of his essay
opaque, and this unfortunate sit-
uation may invalidate much of
my criticism.

,'1‘he plates in Beyondthe Edge

of Certainty are insigniﬁcant.
Either Feyerabend or the editor
saw ﬁt to devote a page and a
half to pictures of rhinoceroses.
This was intended, it appears, to
provide a psychological change
of pace more than to instruct.

decorative but largely unrelated
to the text. The pictures, "then,
must have been inserted to keep
the book from aesthetic sterility.
True to its philosophical basis,
Beyond the Edge of Certainty
makes demands not on one type
of person only, but utilizes and
contributes to one’s knowledge
of ideas in numerous ﬁelds. It

thereby fulﬁlls its humanistic

function better than undiscip-
lined philosophizing——better, that
is, than the kind which has giv-
en philosophy the unfortunate
image of unrestrained, detached
contemplation.

Happily, philosophy has freed
itself, after centuries of Socratic
introspection, Platonic rational-
ism,’ and dogmatic, religious
other-worldliness, of self-deceiv-
ing barriers to the critical ad-
vance of scientiﬁc knowledge.

maintained his unbeatenjrecord, beating Don»

metropolitan basketball team, lacks those convictions.
Someone here asked Timmons how a boy could beneﬁt
from coming to Pitt instead of another bigger basket-
ball school. Timmons’ answer was enough to send a boy
to Duquesne. ,
“We really have no advantages,” Timmons said.
obviously using the soft sell. “Everyone’s about equal.

‘There’s no reason‘ for a boy to pick one school over

another.”

TIMMONS THEN, went on to explain that if basketball
players were asked why they chose one school over another,

they really wouldn’t know. “You could_ask thirty dif-
ferent players and get thirty different reasons,” he
said. “Most schools have pretty much the same fa-
cilities.” ‘
With a sell like that, Timmons would have trouble
giving machine guns to the Viet Cong.
Timmons doesn’t try to sell Pitt -by stressing its

- new physical plant with six basketball courts. He sells

Pitt on the basis of education. “That’s our policy,” he
said. “We can offer a boy the opportunity to go on to
dental school or medical school. ‘

“We also graduate most of our athletes,” he =con- .

tinued. “Ninety-four per cent of the lettermen here
have graduated college.” 1

s _ SO WHAT does that give Pitt that Michigan or Duke doesn’t
' . have? “Nothing, really,” said Timmons.

Perhaps Pitt’s only real recruiting advantage is
publicity. If a local high school star plays at a local
college, he’s sure to have a following. His friends can
read about him in the papers. Why then did Lorry
Hathaway, Jeff Brown, Charlie Schmaus and Ron Sepic
stay away from Pitt? If no school has any real advan-
tage over any other school, certainly some of the bett:r
area ballplayers should be here. But the material goes

places as they crushed the
Panther gymnasts, 94 -26.
Over 6,000 enthusiastic fans
came to watch Pitt thrown to the
lions. \

The Panthers’ only thirds were
Dave McKinnis on the side horse
and Jim Sacco on the horizontal
bars.

Gasps emanated from the
crowd as fans watched the Nit-
fany Lions go through their rou-
tines. “It’s like watching a cir-
cus,” one fan said. “It’s really
eX0itin€.” another admitted. “I
don’t believe what they do.”

Coach Warren Neiger was just
as impressed. “They’re deﬁnitely
a superior team,” he said. “They
have an excellent chance of, go-
ing all the way. They might be
the best in the country.”

A In six of the seven events,
the Lions gained ﬁrsts with scores

of over 9.0. ~.

By BILL CABIN
No one would think a sign
poster in 1929 could become
an Olympic wrestling coach
in 1964. Rex Peery did it.

Peery ended that 35-year
climb to fame last Tuesday
when he announced his resigna-
tion as coach. His resignation be-
comes effective after this season,
but he will remain here as a
physical education instructor.

“I’ve done about as much as I
can in wrestling,” said Peery,
turning a ruler caarelessly in his
hand. “I never anticipated reach-
ing my present level in the sport.
When I ﬁrst started I set my goal
for the top, and the only way you
can make that goal is if you keep
driving.”

Peery began his drive when he
was in high school in Stillwater,
Oklahoma. “I was only 90 pounds when I entered high school,” 1'8-
called Peery, scratching his head. “I sure wasn't a basketball play-
er, and I began wrestling, since it offered a place fo ra little
fella.” As a. little fella, Peery won two state championships in the
105.pou_nd class, and played two years of varsity football.

The depression continued his wrestling career. After graduation,
Peery worked for his father’s outdoor advertising business for two-
and-a-half years. When the depression came, the advertising business
faltered; “About that time coach E. C. Gallagher suggested I enroll at
Oklahoma A.'& M. (now Oklahoma State),” remarked Peery.

Peery enrolled, and became the school’s outstanding athlete. He
lettered two years in baseball, won three NCAA wrestling champion-

ships, two AAU titles, and an alternate berth on the 1932 Olympic_

team. He graduated in 1935 with his .name on the Dean’s list every
semester but two, and was named the outstanding graduate athlete.

“I had decided to teach and coach when I ﬁrst entered A. & M.,”
said Peery,” and gota job as a science teacher and wrestling coach
at Erick High School after graduation.” Mrs. Peery recalled, “That
first year he drove -three boys home eight miles into the country
every evening in order to even have a wrestling team.” .

Within the next 13 years, Peery coached at two other high schools,
compiling a 117-14-3 record and developing four state championship
teams, 34» individual champions, and four AAU champs.

While coaching at Tulsa Central High School in 1949, he was
informed. by Michigan State coach Clifford Keen, that Pitt was ex-

panding its wrestling program and needed a wrestling coach. Keen.

was both a friend of the Peery family, and an army pal of Captain
Tom Hamilton, "then .Pitt’s Athletic Director. ’

“Hamilton called me that summer while I was at camp in Minne-
sota,” he said. “I had only seen Pittsburgh twice, but my son, Hugh,
wanted to go to college, so we drove out to have a look.” He stayed.

In September, 1949, Peery began building a tradition. “The wrest-
ling room was small,” he recalled, “and we only had one 12 by 12
mat.”

By 1951, the Wrestling team was admitted to the Eastern Inter-
collegiate Wrestling Association, and Peery had, been winning ever
since. He has a 112-37-3 coaching record, and has developed wrestlers
who have won 13 ‘national and 22 Eastern individual titles.

“Being named Olympic Free-style Wrestling coach was the climax
of my career,” he said, recalling the 1964 games. “It was the most
experienced, the best conditioned, the best equipped, and, I think,
the best trained team in our history.”

Peery’s career has been not only an individual effort but a
family endeavor. “Wrestling has always been a part of our life,”
said Mrs. Peery. “It will be a different kind of life for us now.”

 June the observatory marked the

50th year of the installation of
the Thaw refractory telescope.
‘-‘It's accepted as the best in the
world for measuring the distance
and motion of the stars.” Dr.
Wigman said.

Among the accomplishments of
the observatory are devising a
time system used by all the na-
tion’s railroads in setting clocks
and discovering that the rings
around Saturn are not solid.

Because research projects cur-
rently underway at the observa-
tory must be completed, the fa-
cility carmot be completely closed
in the near future.

“It is a particularly difficult
decision to phase out the obser-
vatory even temporarily,” "Dr.
Halliday said.

Houser, who also attended the
1961 inauguration, made a few
comparisons between the two.
“The crowd was much less en-
thusiastic and much smaller,” he
noted. “They expected 40 per
cent fewer people this year and
there were fewer grandstands.
The weather was beautiful
though.”

He also felt that there was
much less rapport between Presi-
dent Johnson and the crowds.

i “This might have been due to

Johnson’s riding in a bubble-top
car while President Kennedy rode
in an open one,” -he commented.
“The only excitement came when
President Johnson got out of his
car to welcome the Johnson City

‘ ‘High School band.”
