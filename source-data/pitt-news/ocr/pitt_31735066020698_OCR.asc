Zola Budd left her native country,
then returned, knowing fullwell that
to compete in track competitions
there would ‘end her international
career as_a 3,000-meter runner. Her
homeland, South Africa, is a pariah
_nation in the eyes of the rest of the
civilized world because the
governing regime practices a policy
of apartheid. South Africa is _far
away, but the debate surrounding
apartheid touches the Pitt campus in.
the form of university investment in
South Africa. -

The University of Pittsburghhas
been wrestling with the moral and
financial implications of investment
in South Africa since the late 1970s.

are non-binding directives aimed-at
promoting desegregation and equal

' treatment‘ in the South African-

based, but usually American owned,
workplace. Whites and nonwhites
work,.eat and shower together, but
go home to very different lives. ’

Last month, the Student
Government Board again called for
the university to cease investing in

South Africa, and endorsed State
“House of Representatives Bill 1400.

Bill 1400 passed by a wide margin,
but will return to the House for

-further refinement.‘ Bill 1400

requires all “state-related

. "universities and member institutions

of the State System of Higher
Education to.divest themselves of

"investments: in the Republic of

South Africa.” ~

The arguments are numerous and

pose a problem for Dr. Bernard H.
Kobosky, vice president of public
affairs for_ Pitt. “Are we doing good
or harm?” Kobosky asked; He does
not condoneapartheid, but took
issue with Bill 1400 calling it
ambiguous. “On I400, there is no yes
or no answer,” he said. “We deal
only. with firms which adhere to the
Sullivan Principles.”

‘Michael Hagen handles the
university’s investments in the office

of the vice president for businessand '“

finance._“We hire institutional
money managers who manage these

portfolios — endowment funds," he
said’. “When we hire the money
managers, we advisethem that in

accepting our account, we place no

restriction‘ on the way they manage
the funds, except that they cannot

invest in companies which have

South‘ African operations and which

are not signatories to the Sullivan .

Principles.” Hagen added that

Joseph Dutton, vice president for

‘business and finance, sent a letter
advising the management firms of
the university’s policy.

“We really put the, responsibility.

on them,” Hagen added. “These

~—stocks are not to be purchased.” The

university employs four .manage-
merit firms, and provides them with
a list of companies with South
African operations which do not
adhere to the Sullivan Principles.
“We also monitor it ourselves.
From time to time, others have

unknowingly purchased stocks, and ‘

we've had to go back to them and say
“‘you’ve got to dispose of this stock,’ ’.’
Hagen said. Over the course of seven
years, Pitt funds have improperly
invested in ‘non-signatory firms

» approximately six times, according

to Hagen. "The Pit'tsburgh Courier
reported Junev2, 1984, that of the
lll companies Pitt invests in, 30
conduct business in South Africa.

Investment in South Africa is"

further complicated by the

I

up port  ulliiva n  

  for S. African investments

definition of the word “operations.”
Bill 1400 stipulates that corpora-
tions, subsidiariesor affiliates of
corporations “more than 50 percent
owned or operated by the govern-
ment of the Republic of South
Africa” are not to be invested in by
state-related universities like Pitt.
The bill also includes subsidiaries
or affiliates of American firms
incorporated under South African
law, domiciled in that country, or
controlled by a U.S. firm. This is to
be determined by the Department of
C_ommerce. This is where semantics

. enter into"the argument.

“What constitutes a’South

Afr_i'can operation?" Hagen asked. '

“Some people have said that if
you’re running a truly pure South
Africa-free portfolio, you can’t
purchase any U.S.,Treasury
obligations because the U.S.
government conducts business with
South Africa. We use the Rev.
Sullivan’s guidelines. If they (a

corporation)’ hold a 20 percent or .

more_ equity position in‘a South
African subsidiary, or if they have a
direct qperation in South Africa,
they would be considered as being
South African by-Sullivan,” Hagen
said. ‘‘It all revolves around the
term,»‘doing business in South
Africa.’ ”'

Mayor  
unveils  
budget

By Ingrid Smith

’ The Pitt News

Mayor Richard  Caliguiri pre-‘T -

sented a $274.9 million 1985 operat-
ing budget that didn’t include a tax’
increase for l985 and projected no
tax increase for 1986 in his annual
“State of the City- Address,”
yesterday.

In reviewing the city’s accom-.

plishments this past year and outlin-
ing plans for the future, the mayor
told city council, “Last year, we
presented to you not only an operat-
ing budget for 1984, but also the
financial outlook for 1985. Last year
I told you that 1985 was going to be a
difficult year and we would do ever-
ything we could to" balance the
budget in 1985. Today, I am proud

to announce that our ‘efforts’ have

paid off: The 1985 budget has_been
balanced without a tax increase.

 »- ‘*<While«th-is alone is certainly good '

news,‘ our attempts to hold the _line
on costshave pr-oven'more success-

ful than anticipated. Our taxpayers _

will have been spared a city_tax
increase for at least four years,” said
Caliguiri. ’ _ _.
While Caliguiri realized that this
is a “surprising and risky” prediction
to make the council is seeing the
effects of »many belt-tightening
efforts and management improve-

S ments that the city has made over the

last — several years which “should
allow us to attain this goal.”

The mayor. revealed plans for two
major departmental reorganiza-
tions. The creation ofa new Depart-
ment of Public Safety will consoli-
date police, fire and emergency med-
icalsservices under one organization
to insure a better approach to “-pro-
tect residents’ lives and properties”
and changes in the organization of
the Pittsburgh Zoo. ‘ .

Caliguiri explained that the
administration has been successful

in increasing revenuesvthrough a,

number of initiatives. He said the
impact of Renaissance II will be felt
next year when properties paying an
estimated $2.3 million in property

taxes will go on the city’s tax rolls. In ~-

addition, $2 million will be realized

annually through the city’s challenge ‘ -

of downtown real estate assess-
ments. The PGH-40 effort to collect
delinquent earned income taxes will
add another $2 million in revenues
annually.

In addition to this, the booting

program instituted this year to crack
down on parking scofflaws is'bring-

Nicaraguan electoral

process -‘fair’ speaker says

By Bill Nlchle
The Pitt News

W

“Despite what the Reagan admin-
istration might say, the Sandinistas
in Nicaragua did not stop opposi-
tion parties from participating in the
November 4 elections," according to
James M. Malloy, chairman of Pius
political science department.

Malloy, along’ with, 14 other
members of an executive committee,-

spent a week‘observing the recent
’ election

in Nicaragua, and
addressed his findings to a standing-
room crowd of about 45 at noon
yesterday at Forbes Quadrangle.

“After meeting with a few of the
opposition party leaders, I feel that
the U.S. government pressured
many oppositional parties not to
participate in the elections," said_
Malloy.

“The Reagan administration is

doing everything possible to dis-
credit the Nicaraguan electoral pro-
cess, but from what we [the

executive committee] observed and-

studied, their electoral process is
fair,” said Malloy. ’ .

Malloy admitted he had a skepti-
cal image of Nicaragua due to news
coverage by the US. media. “But
after being there I can tell you that
mostly everything being written
about Nicaragua is negatively
biased, and is not fair and honest,
said Mallory. '

“Sure, the Sandinistas are a domi-
nant political force, but they are not
hegemonic or totalitarian in poli-
tics," said Malloy. “The Sandinistas

control the police and army, but iiotxv

the economy or religion. In fact, I
feel the Sandinistas indirectly helped
the opposition parties contend in the
election,” said Malloy.

M-alloy went on to say the elec- '

tions are just a moment in an on-‘
going process. “There is nothing in
this election pointing to finality,” he

99‘

said. “The politics in Nicaragua are
open-ended.”

An example of this open-ended
political system is the Nicaraguan

— Constitution. The legislative assem-

bly, which consists of_95 members,
including the losing opposition lead-
ers, are currently'negotiating a new
constitution. “Everything politically
is still up in the air; everyone has a
chance politically," said Malloy.

“Walls in Nicaragua. are painted
with every conceivable political slo-
gan, and each party got 22 hours of
free TV time with the option to buy
more,” said Malloy. But Malloy
warned that the Sandinistas, “being_
the incumbents, did abuse their right
to the media, especially television."

"Many "opposition parties Cpﬁlled
out of the election to avoid a bad
showing. But Malloy feels some con-
tra leaders are nothing but front men
for the U.S. embassy. “One is Arturo
Jose Cruz. He is a straw man. To the
best of our observations Cruz
doesn’t represent anyone,” said
Malloy. '

Retraction A

An article appearing in the
Nov. 2 issueof The Pitt News,
entitled “Apartment Pitfalls”
incorrectly stated that David
Padawar of Daran Management
was the rental agent through
whom a st_udent rented her
apartment, which later was the
Sl.lb_]CCt of court litigation.
Actually, the_student found her
apartment through the landlord.
Also, It. was Daran Management
that originally filed suit against
the students rather than the

_ students suing Daran, as the ‘
article stated.

City address

Mayor proposes budget

continued from page one
ing in over one half million dollars in
previously uncollected parking
fines.

The mayor claims that the city has
been successful in controlling expen-
ditures, particularly in the area of
debt, service, personnel and fringe
benefits.

The mayor stated, “Most ofthese
initiatives have been in place for sev-
eral years. The cumulative effect of
these increased revenues and cost
controls now places us in an
improved financial position."

In the area of capital improve?

ments, the mayor is proposing an
outlay of $ 130 million for 1985 with
the administration's ongoing prior
commitment to ,neighborhoo’d
improvements such as b-ridge
repairs, street resurfacing, play-
ground facilities, and public safety
and commercial revitalizations.
Elaborating on the need for a new
Department of Public Safety, the
mayor said,’“This year several inci-
dents occured which indicated we
need to make improvements in the
area of public safey. We learnedthat
fire safety equipment is not always
up to standard, nor are»\all of our

“ vehicles- equipped with safety belts.

The recent hazardous material inci-
dent in the Strip District pointed out
o_ur need to develop better policies
and procedures for disaster
response. The fact that it took many
months to apprehend a, suspect in

V the South Side arsons suggests that

better coordinations may be needed
between police and fire depart-
'ments._ g ‘

The mayor said it has become evi-
dent that the police, fire and emer-
gency medical services should be
combined under one individual who
can effectively coordinate the efforts
in this area. Caliguiri recommended
-the new department should be
placed under the leadership of Glenn
Cannon, present director of Medical

Services. Under him four deputy
directors would be appointed to
head the administration, police, fire
services
branches.

, With the development of the new
department, Caliguiri expects to’
institute changes in the following
areas: « ’

l.. Arson — Improvement of
investigation efforts through fire
and police efforts.

2. Evaluation oftraining for all
uniformed personnel. ,

3. Medical training, and provid-
ing CPR training for police and fire-
men to improve the quality of care to
the public. _ . .

- 4. Replace police officers doing
clerical work with clerks and putting
all uniformed officers onb the
streets. ' ’

.5. Development of a trained
hazardous materials response team.

‘6. Use of a tactical
approach to improve police man-
power deployment for special events
and certain crime-related situations.

Caliguiri also plans to combat the
rising auto theft in the city. He said,
“I am warning anyone to look
behind, infront, and to the sides of
you before you steal a car, because
we will be right there next to you.”

In proposing the establishment of
the Mon—Ohio' Development and

iReconstruction Commission, the

mayor said, “the Reagan adminis-
tration has made a decision not to
aid industrial areas like ours with
government economic policies such
as import quotas on steel. The
national administration believes
that our region willeventually feel
the impact of economic recovery

-that seems to be occuring in other

parts of the country. However, the
decline in an economy that formerly

ments in ‘our river valley towns is

‘responded to national trends toward

economic-recovery and growth.“
Caliguiri claimed that the local

government must take the lead in

strives toward the goal of economic"
recovery for the entire region.

To address this problem, Caliguiri
proposed that the Commonwealth,
the four counties of Allegheny,
Beaver, Washingtonand Westmore-
land and the city enter into an agree-
ment to direct their combined
energies and "resources into a devel-
opment and reconstruction for the
communities of this region’s indus-
trial valleys. 1 ‘ '

In reference to the state legisla-
ture’s recent clarification of the -
intent of the Home Rule Enabling’
Act allowing the city to continue its
taxing structure, Caliguiri com-'
mented, “The legislature is to be
congratulated for their prompt and
responsible actions.

“Clearly, we would have been
unable to provide our residents with
the present levels of service, and our
future stability would have been
uncertain if this action had not been

GSPIA : Benjamin Aims at Mediocrity ,

Provost Roger Benjamin made
his first serious blunder in “moving
from where we are to a more reputa-
ble academic institution” last week
with his unprofessional announce-
ment of the proposal to dissolve
GSPIA. Many comments can be
made about the provost’s dubious
intentions in last week's proposal,
especially after hearing some rather
slanderous descriptions of the
faculty in his rough draft assess-
ments. (Can we really believe he is
not looking for a method to cut
tenured faculty when he cannot even
respond to a question concerning
the importance of the present school
and establishing a new one with a
different name?)

Leaving the underlyingreasons
for the provost's proposals-aside,..it

is extremely possible that the very.

nature of his proposals against
GSPIA, and his methods of making

_ those decisions known to the public,

could-have a catastrophic effect on
the reputation of the entire univer-
sity. Does Benjamin really feel that
such judicious tactics as informing
the Press of his proposed cuts of
“unproductive” faculty will help
establish a “reputable academic
institution?" Even more impor-
tantly, does the provost expect repu-
table students to remain apathetic to
the destroyed reputation of one of
the few nationally known schools in
the University of Pittsburgh?

At Saturday’s meeting ..with
GSPIA students, Benjamin stated
that GSPIA had no immediate
benefit to the local community, and

" that only _locally relevant programs,

such as economics and engineering,

_ would be allowed to expand. The

provost could not comment on a stu-
dent’s statement acknowledging
GSPIA as probably the most rele-
vant program to Pittsburgh's grow-
ing international administrative
center. The excuse of no local rele-
vance seems to be afeeble shot in the
dark by Benjamin to explain Pitt’s
intended shift to a more technically
oriented institution.

This obvious shift has caused a
more than mild panic throughout
the nontechnical departments in the
university..Other than the inevitable
“exodus of faculty” from GSPIA
upon dissolving the school and
tenure, what about the students?
GSPIA students quite possibly
turned down acceptance to George-
town University and other nation-
ally reputable schools on the basis of
GSPIA‘s reputation and affordabil-
ity. They are not going to continue in
an institution that has not only lost

its form and name, but also its very’

base — the faculty.

The “mass exodus" will probably,

not stop with this group of upper-
echelon graduate students, though.
Some of 'Pitt’s more ambitious
undergraduates also refused expen-
sive private schools only for the
prospect of attending such graduate
programs as Philosophy and

- GSPIA, which have national repu-

tations minus the Ivy League tui-

tion. After last week's announce-
ment, talk of transferring to other
universities has already, become
common among International Stu-
dies and Foreign Language majors.
This is not such a surprising pheno-

menon, since these Pitt students
chose this university for properties
that make it outstanding from other
state-supported schools.

In proposing the dissolution of
GSPIA, Benjamin has only taken
the first step in a long process of
reorganizing the university. He has
also noted future plans of trimming

the School of Education. However '

he may handle future reorganization
(we hope, though, that it be in a less
detrimental manner than the
announcement of GSPIA’s), the
effect will be the same. In stepping
on the more unique and reputable
programs at Pitt, the provost is leav-
ing only those of average quality in a
sea of competition to hold up the
name of'the university. Will these
expanded programs of “immediate
local interest” really be new and
improved enough to compete with
the top programs in the nation?
Even if they were, expansion would
take time.

With premature cuts in Pitt's‘best
programs, Roger Benjamin is only
encouraging the disassociation of
the name “University of Pittsburgh”
with any concept of quality that,
until now, may have existed nation-

ally or internationally. If the univer-_

sity indeed decides to destroy one of
its few attractions andthen hold out
its arms to better students and a
stronger reputation, the result seems
predictable. As one GSPIA student
said about the Graduate School of
Public Administration to take
GSPIA’s place . . “Who would
come?”

“Genocicle”— film shows horrors of holocaust

‘ By Jill Colamarlno
rhe Pitt News

. “Couldwe [the U.S.] have done
more? At what point do good people
feel the need to speak up?”

These were two of the questions
that Isaiah Kuperstein, director of
the holocaust center, asked the
audience to keep in mind at the
showing of the Academy Award-
winning film “Genocide” Sunday
evening in the student union.

The Holocaust Memorial, pres-
entedin cooperation with the Holo-
caust'Center of B’nai B’rith Hillel,
sought to increase awareness of the

Allocation

By Dan Taylor
The Pitt News

The present. system of allocating
funds for graduate student support
has come under fire by faculty
members. At the November meeting
of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences
Council held on Tuesday, Doug
Ashford of the Political Science
department presented a paper
detailing what he considers to be
faults of the system. Ashfordand
other faculty members would like to

millions of European Jews in the late
30s and early 40s.

Kuperstein introduced the film by
detailing acts of the “legal exclusion
of Jews from German life.”_These

_ included barring Jewish physicians

and lawyers from practicing, out-
lawing Jewish publications and the
hassling of Jews trying to leave Ger-
many. “These and other events
exemplify the Nazi plan to get rid of
Jews,” Kuperstein said.

“Genocide,” an 80-minute docu-
mentary narrated by Elizabeth Tay-
lor and Orson Wells, was virtually
filled with actual film footage and
still photos of concentration camps‘
and those who were forced to stay
there.

The film was a comprehensive
look at the events leading up to
Hitler’s regime, the deceptive
methods the Nazis used_to lure Jews
and others considered a threat to the
Aryan race (blacks, homosexuals,
gypsies) into concentration camps
and the stark realities of what
occurred once inside the camps.

The bleak photos and film clips of
dead bodies being hurled into 15-
feet-deep ditches alréady half-filled
with corpses, coupled with testim-
ony of survivors, caused more than a
few gasps ofhorror from those in the
audience.

The replies of “We were only
doing our jobs” by those arrested
and charged with “crimes against
humanity” offered little satisfaction

or condolence to those affected by
the film’s content.

Immediately following the film,
Holocaust survivor Al Lewin related
his personal experiences, beginning
with when Hitler came to power
when Lewin was eight years old.

Lewin did forced labor for two
years when he was l6 and then was
arrested and brought to Auschwitz,
probably the most famous concen-
tration camp, when he was 18. He
spent 1,776 days there.»

Lewin offered to showithe

audience the number tattooed on his '

arm and the scars on his ears where
he was hanged for trying to help
someone escape. Lewin and others
said that some people try to deny
that the Holocaust ever happened

and Lewin offered the tattoo and
scars as physical proof that it “was
no hoax.”

Lewin then went into a..detailed
account of “Krystalnacht,” or “night
of broken glass,” which occurred on
Thursday, Nov. 10, 1938.

Krystalnacht consisted of the
Nazi invasion of Jewish communi-
ties, the raping of Jewish women and
the looting and setting fire to Jewish
establishments, businesses and syn-

agogues. Lewin witnessed, among ‘

other things, his, father being
dragged down three flights of steps
and being brutalized by Nazi forces.

“You may be wonderinghow I

can remember so many details,”

Lewin said, his slight German accent

of funds for grad students questioned

see the funds administered in a more
flexible manner, giving more to
those who excell and less to the aver-
age or substandard student’. Said
Ashford, “Half the grad students
I’ve met don’t belong in grad
school.” Dean of FAS J.L. Rosen-
berg, while not endorsing Ashford's
statement, did concede that perhaps
half of the graduate students are
indeed below average.

The recent focus on graduate stu-
dent support policies is the result_of
an increasingly tight budget. This A

- scarcity of funds, combined with an

increasing undergraduate student
population and decreasing faculty,
has made for a very difficult situa-

tion. Dean Irwin Schulman pres-
ented the undergraduate point of
view, stressing the decreasing facul-
ty/student ratio. Schulman would
like to see more faculty and fewer
TAs. He described a situation where
students receive instruction from a
graduate student and have little
interaction with their professor, say-
ing, “How onejustifies $2,600 a year
tuition for that, I don’t know.”
Schulman went on to explain that.

such funding.

The argument made by the var-,

ious departments is that they would
like to have more control over the
funds allocated to their graduate
programs once these funds get to the
department. As it is, all TAs receive
the same stipend and are expected to
put in 20 hours per week. This does
not help, attract top graduate stu-
dents. Another problem is that some
departments have little need of TAs
but still need something to offer
their graduate students. Dean Eliza-

beth Baranger explained the need of
the graduate programs, “More fel-

lowships and less TA-ships, that’s

what we would like.”
The concensus among council
. members was that this problem will
not have an easy or fast solution.

vProfessorpAshford was asked to

draft a proposal giving more depart-
mental control of funds, and con-
sented to do so. Any transfer of
funds between departments was left
to future consideration.

The council also elected new

members to the Faculty Grants-

Committee. The committee receives
and judges proposals from faculty
members for small research grants.

issue is more visceral. _Black studies
professor Dr. Barbara Sizemore
equated the university’s policies with
slavery. “The university is saying

A that money is more important than

freedom. Nobody. believes that," she
said. “Everybody wants to be free,
nobody wants to be a rich slave. The
black’ workers they are talking about
are only 1 percent ofthe population,
and the United States is investing in
terrorism," she stated.

Sizemore said all investments in

South Africa, including Pitt’s, must ‘

cease‘. “The only reason this
[investment] is making sense to
people is because the people are
black. \This is a racist country [South
Africa] and these people in this
country don’t give a damn about

‘ black people, a-nd so they’re

expendable,” she said. “It really
makes me angry. The condition
makes me angry.” _

SGB member Jeff Mallinger
stated the board’s position. “We

want the university to divest
[themselves] of all their investments
in South African companies. In my
mind, it is any company that has any
type of dealing in South Africa,” he
said. In Mallinger’s opinion, that
includes firms based in South Africa
with branches in the United States.
- When asked what the university
has helped’ accomplish through its
South African investments,
Mallinger replied, “Their own
financial gain. I am sure there are
other investments which are just as

good for Pitt located in the U.S. or .

Europe.” -

In an earlier interview with the
Pittsburgh . Courier, Kabosky said,
“Pulling out of companies has
negative implications." In the same
interview, he added, “... the system
of apartheid is immoral, but in no
way would the university‘s selling of
its stock change the policies in South
Africa; but if we can give the South
African worker eight hours a day of

freedom, we have taleen.»a positive
step."

Mallinger agreed that the Sullivan A

Principles are morally correct. “No
one can argue against the Sullivan
Principles, but'the Sullivan

Principles don’t hit the basic ills of VI

South Africa; the blacks don’t have
equality.” '

Board member Avery Abrams
said those black workers employed
by Sullivan Principle signatories
earn an average of75 cents per week.
“The Sullivan Principles are
extremely easy to say you agree with
them, it takes nothing. They arejust
rhetoric, they don’t address in any

way, shape or form the political ..

conditions over there. Over 90
pecent of the South African
population is black: they're
disenfranchised, they can't vote,” he

‘said. “What’s the difference between

this and Hitler’s Nazi Germany?
Any way you look at it, we are
supporting this apartheid regime.”

Newsbriefs

(UPI) — A navy spokesman
denied that there is any connection
between ongoing Naval exercises
around Puerto Rico and charges
from Nicaragua that America is
planning to launch an invasion. The
spokesman said the exerciseshave
been planned for more than one year
and will end on Nov. 19. The White
House and the Pentagon also denied
there is any plan to invade Nicara-
gua. The left-wing Nicaraguan
government continues to stir anti-
American fervor by placing tanks in
cities and mobilizing troops. A U.S.
_military- spokesman said there_ is
“circumstantial evidence" that the
Sandinista government plans an

' invasion ‘of American-backed Hon-

duras or El Salvador.

(UPI) — A‘ Congressional advi-
sory panel said that NASA needs to
clearly define its goals in space
before building its proposed eight-
billion-dollar space station. The
office of Technology Assessment
said there is no immediate justifica-
tion for the cost, timetable or most
of the physical structures’ proposed
in the space station plan. The agency
called for a broad national debate on
the issue.

area. Speakes said Reagan is still
committed to a tax plan that would
not generate more money.

Caffeine “wreaks havoc" on heart  

_ caffeine

(UPS) — Most students know
that a little caffeine taken before or
during an exam may give them a
feeling of much-needed energy.

What they don’t know, however, is
that the combined effects of exam-
time stress and caffeine can wreak
havoc on their cardiovascular
system. .

A new study found that ingesting

raises blood pressure and intensifies
the effects of stress on the heart.

‘Duke University professor Dr.
James Lane outlined his findings in
his report, “Caffeine Magnifies Car-

.diovascular Responses to Stress."

Lane reached his conclusions by A

measuring the blood pressures of 33
male undergraduates as they took a
sample 12-minute math test. The
average blood pressure went up
seven millimeters when students had

ingested no caffeine before the test,
but it went up 10 points after stu-
dents had two or three cups of
coffee.

The average blood pressure ofthe
"students who had taken no caffeine
was 120 over 65 before the test and
127 over 72 when the test was over.

But after two cups of coffee, after-
test blood pressures averaged 135
over 77‘. Blood pressure of more
than 140 over 90 is considered high.

Problems plague higher education

' USPS — A panel of prominent_
educators, bringing the spotlight
away from shortcomings in elemen-

tary and high schools, recently-

released ‘a report warning that
higher education has serious prob-~
lems, ranging from high drop-out
rates, seriously deteriorating build-
ings and equipment to students
abandoning the liberal arts.

“Students learning, curricular
coherence, the quality, of facilities,
faculty morale and academic stand-
ards no longer measure up to our
expectations,” the "panel's report
said. ‘ I

In the report prepared for Educa-
tion Secretary—T.H. Bell, and the
National Institute of Education, the
panel called" for drastic changes in
higher education, including two full
years of liberal education for all
bachelors degree recipients, even if
it means extending undergraduate
programs beyond the usual four
years.

The panel also recommended re-
focusing faculty and resources on
freshmen and sophomores, improv-
ing advising facilities for students
and creating ways to assess students’
learning. V

“Warning signals" of the deterio-
rating conditions of higher educa-
tion ‘include declining student
performance from 1964 to 1982 in II

“One cannot blame these trends
entirely on the decline in the prepa-
ration of entering college students,"
the report said. “Part of the problem

is what happens to students after _

they matriculate in college."

The report, “Involvement in
Learning: Realizing the Potential of
American Higher Education," was
prepared by the Stiudy Group on the
Conditions of Excellence in Ameri-
can Higher Education. Its chairman,
Kenneth P. Mortimer, is professor
of higher education and public
administration at Pennsylvania

The Panel recommended
years of liberal education.-to

strengthen undergraduate degree ‘L

programs. “Students are not likely

‘to accumulate in four years both the

generalized and special knowledge

necessary for first-rate performance

as professionals,” the report said.
Another “warning signal” the

two full_

panel found was that only half ofthe .

students who start college ever
receive bachelor's degrees. The
panel also said that “one out of eight
highly able high school seniors does
not choose to attend college."

"The panel sees the increasing

number of undergraduates majoring
in narrow specialties and the
decreasing number of bachelor's
degrees awarded in arts and sciences
as problems. The percentage of stu-
dents majoring in the arts and scien-
ces fell from 49 percent in 1971 to 36
percent in 1982. The report said
nearly half of the 1,000 majors
"offered ‘by American colleges and
universities are in occupational
fields. '

.The panel recommended that lib-
eral education he the central core in
undergraduate education, a shift
from the specialization now promi-
nent. “College curriculum has
become excessively vocational in its
orientation, and the bachelor’s
degree has lost its potential to foster
the shared values and knowledge
that bind us together as a society."

The percentage of freshmen
intending to become professors
plummeted from 1.8 percent of
entering students in 1966 to 0.2 per-
cent in 1982. “This 89 percent
decline bodes ill for the futureﬂof
higher education,” the report said.

The report criticized schools for
favoring assertive students when

passive students. That passivity, the
report said, is a warning sign of a
lack of involvement. The panel
recommended that student involve-
ment be increased.

“lt’s because Krystalnachthappened

Fritz Ottenheimer described
himself as “an escapee from the
Holocaust rather than a survivor."

Ottenheimer had made his bar‘
mitzvah eight months prior to
Krystalnacht and also vividly
described that-fateful night. .

“One good thing that came out of
Krystalnacht,” Ottenheimer said,
“was that we knew we had to leave.”

Ottenheimer said that his father
was one of the few Jewish men not
arrested on Krystalnacht and
speculated that it was because his

father was a well-known World War
1 hero. His ther was, however,
“hauled away“ to a concentration
camp for about a month but
returned safely to his family.

Ottenheimer's family left
Constance, Germany in May of
1949. ’

Following the talks by Lewin and
Ottenheimer, a question-and-

concentrated on modern” day
anti-Semitism and the possibility of
another Holocaust.

“We cannot forget what
happened," Ottenheimer said. “We
must‘ remember and make sure this
sort of thing will never happen

Digging in   .

  Freshmen skill level beyond their years

‘By Jim (lrban
The Pitt News-

The University of Pittsburgh
women’s volleyball team travels to
Providence,_R.I., this weekend in
quest of the Big .East Conference
championship. Coach Shelton Col-
lier is looking for this weekend to be
the stepping-stone to NCAA post-
season play. The Lady Panthers are
the top-seed in the tournament, and
Collier’s squad is hoping to avenge
last year’s '3-0 loss to Providence in
the tournament final. Providence is

. seeded second. , _ .

‘The. Lady Panthers are currently
25-6 and owe much of theirsuccess
to the play of.two freshmen,4Krista
Ziener and Louise O’Shaughnessy.
Both have stepped in and played
well in pressure situations, and Col-
lier looks to them to/contribute a_
‘great deal this weekend. He
explained, “We” are relying onthem
more and more every weekend to
produce in pressure ‘situations, and
they are both rising to the increased
challenges_ every week,”

_ Perhaps their ability to contribute
so well is due to their previous expe-

rience. No'strangers to pressure,-
A both Ziener and O’Shaughnessy
‘captained their high school teams to ‘

post-season play last year. Ziener led
North. Allegheny to a second-place
finish in the PIAA tournament while
O'Shaughnessy led Clarkson High
School to a silver medal ﬁnish at the
Ontario Championships. This expe-
rience has paid off, Collier noted.

“We played a lot of, nationally
ranked teams, but it do'esn"t seem to
bother them.. They go out and do
their job regardless of who we're

playing."

As successful as this year has
been, it has ‘not been all fun, and

ies and was not expected to contri_b-
‘me as much as shehas, but Collier
never lost confidence in her: .‘‘I don‘t
think anyone really expected her to
bou_nce back 100 percent. As it turns

out, shehas done far more than ever

expected.” Collier summed up Zien-

, er’s season by comrnenting, “She has

been a big success at a variety of
positions and has kept us winning.

Collier singled out Ziener’s play in_

wins over Duke, Notre Dame, Penn

It was certainly a modest begin-
ning for Pitt gymnast Matt Peters.

. As he tells it, “My seventh grade gym

teacher was also the assistant high

guess I liked it.” A quiet career start

Peters, a junior from Kiski Area j;

A High School, does not like‘to talk

‘-'=ment. Commenting on his ‘high.

about himself. He brushes. aside

questions—about personal achieve- .

school career, Peters said only, “I'

went torstates [the state champion-"

ships] as a s_enior and won some
things there.” And of his chancesof
having an All-America season this

‘year, he replied with a bemused

query, “All-American‘? What is
that?” This despite the fact that the

Pitt media. guide lists in the proﬁle of

Peters such impressive accomplish-
ments.-as his having “qualified for
nationals -with a 9.78 on high bars,

O’Shaughnessy. The middle blocker

ments already, and I expect in a year

O’Shaughnessy agrees, “I' have
learned a lot this season. Shelton
Collier is a great coach, he is easy to
work with." "Collier credited
O’Shaughnessy for her performan-
ces against Penn State and at the
LSU tournament, where she was

"team. ' L

Collier will look_ for a‘ total team

Championship this weekend. From
.there,.the Lady ‘Panthers’ will ven-

and look, to establish themselves
among volleyball’s elite. The second

“He also. has a chance to make

probably, and we expect a lot from
Matt and Mark.”-
..Change the subject to the entire
- Pitt team, and Peters opens up. “We
have a lot oftalent on this team. We
had our highest score ever against
Navy on Saturday, but we still have
a lot of room for improvement.”
Peters, for however talented the
Panthers may be, still does not see

the squad making a serious run at.

very best teams, "schools like Penn '

State and Ohio State, put in so much

practice seven hours a day. It seems

like if you put in enough time almost ‘

Yesterday I was wa_lking down

' Cardiacllill, cussing at the cold and

the cop who almost ran me over with
his motor scooter, when I heard two
fellow students talking as they
walked in front of me.

"Pitt sure was’ lucky to get by
Tulane on Saturday," said one.

"Yah. sure is sad. Pitt at 2-7-l.
Not going to get to go to a bowl
game. I'm ashamed I go to school
here." said the other.

“Me too," said the first.

I hope that these two zeros are the
only ones who think this way on
campus but I fear that there are oth-

ers. And for all ofyou out there who

are ashamed of going to this school
because of the record of the football
team, this column is for you.

" Pitt is an educational institution.
It also happens to field a football
team. Not the other way around.

I hope that you came‘ to this
school for an education, because
people who are like the two above
are_in sore need of'one. If you came
to school here to watch football I
have some news for you: season
tickets are $60. a lot less than tuition.

 

The Pitt News, Wednesday, November 14,’ 1984

Pitt, as a university. has nothing
to be ashamed of. Some areas and
many professors are nationally and

internationally recognized as,

experts in their fields. I am very
proud to have attended the School
of Pharmacy at Pitt and feel that I
have been offered as fine an educa-
tion as is found anywhere else. and
better than most.

The key word in that last para-
graph is “offered."It is up to mejust
how good the education I receive is.

And Pitt the football team is not a
shame. It may be a disappointment,
but it has nothing to shame Pitt. It
has not quit, something that would
bring shame to Pitt’s name. The
football team has pl_ayed some ofthe
best teams in the nation and lost.
Y_es, lost. But is it a sin to lose? -

In this town, maybe.

The saying goes, “Show me a

good loser and I'll show you a 1oser,",

but not only is this town not a-good
loser, it isn’t even a good winner.

In 1982, when Pitt was 6-0 and_
ranked No. l in the country, were
people happy‘? No. They were com-
plaining because Pitt didn’t win by
enough. . '

And the greatest sin perhaps is yet
to be committed: a loss to Pennsyl-
vania State University."

That larger-than-life game which,
usually, makes one person’s season

Moore Ideas  

and breaks another’s. has taken a
strange twist this year. Pitt fans are
conceding the game two weeks
before the start of it. Pitt bumper
stickersware being removed, buttons
are being pitched and jackets are

being hung back in the closets,
stored until the next winning season
and bowl bid.

Some say you arejust as well with-
out these fair-weather fans. Be
thankful that they don't play foot-
ball because if they did Pitt would
be 0-10 and wouldn't have even
shown up for the last five games;
after the first five, these people
would have quit playing, just as they
have quit cheering for the team. This
is a shame. '

Pitt an education, not just Saturday school

I am disappointed in the season
that Pitt is having and there are
times that I get upset with the‘ Pan-
thers, but no matter what, they are
still my team. And whether they win,
lose, draw or get blown out at Penn
State they will still be my team and if
they give it 100 percent they will
have nothing to be ashamed of, no

matter what the score is.

But there is something at Pitt I am
ashamed of. Those two yo-yos and
anyone else who thinks like them.

NEW YORK (UPI) ——
Edmonton Oilers center Wayne
Gretzky was named the NHL’s
“Player of the Week.” Gretzky
tallied 14 points on five goals and
nine assists in four road games

posting the best mark to begin a
season. The Oilers compiled a
record of 12-0-3, before losing to
the Flyers in Philadelphia. “The '

Great One” has 17 goals and 30

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

Admittedly, it’s been some time
since one of these purely-opinion-
ated pieces appeared under the
above byline. Lulls in the football
schedule provide opportunities for
the mind to wander. If I’ve strayed
too far, would someone kindly
speak up? ' .

Snipers continued to make head
coach Foge Fazio their favorite
target lately. Prior to Saturday’s
game against Tulane, several entre-
preneurs camped out around Pitt
Stadium selling “Foge Who” bags to

_ be worn over the head. The $1 dona-

tions supposedly went to Children’s
Hospital. According to ticket man-
ager Dick Lukehart, CH never auth-
orized such schemes. Lukehart and
uniformed cops had their hands full
sweeping away the con artists.

Along with many other prospects,
Washington High School’s Brian
Davis gave the Pitt locker room 31

look-see after the 21-10 win against
the Green Wave. Now the WP1AL’s
10th all-time rushing leader, Davis is
listed by some scouting bureaus as
the top blue-chipper in the nation.
Word has it, though, that Notre
Dame and Penn State have turned
the cold shoulder because Davis’

grades may not make the 2.C-
requirement schools across the
nation uphold.

CIDEI

When three-time All-America Bill
Fralic heard Davis visited Louisiana
State when the Bengal Tigers faced

Notre Dame three weeks‘ ago, the-

Penn Hills product told him, “Ifyou
decide to come here, you won’t have
any regrets at all.”

Although I take heart with those
fans not brave enough to weather
the elements — let alone watch two
losing football teams —- last week-
end, it was saddening to see a "less

No. 79 was retired at halftime. An

Viewpoint

Fralic could not be deserving of a
higher honor, discounting a Heis-
man Trophy that sidesteps players
on losing teams. .

Yet the ceremony underscored
something more. With Fralic leav-
ing Pitt after next week’s bloodbath
against Penn State, how long will it
be before the Panthers boast
another All-America? No doubt cur-
rent underclassmen like Craig “Iron-
head" Heyward, placekicker Mark

Brasco (if he stays put and quits »

On the basketball front —~ yes,
there is still hope for Division I fans
in Oakland — Coach Roy Chipman
fumed recently upon hearing that
only Boston C_ol1ege‘s center, Roger
McReady, was ranked lower than
Keith Armstrong at that slot in the
Big East. Roy, you knew it had to

happen. First the conference picks

the Panthers to finish ﬁfth — ahead
of the Eagles, the only conference
rival Pitt hasn’t beaten in two years
— and then the coaches make prize
recruit Charles Smith the only
unanimous choice for the first-team
all-frosh squad. Plus, he was picked‘
pre-season freshman of the year.

‘Everything can’t be that rosy. From

the looks of him, though, Arm-
strong did beef up over the summer
and will prove his critics wrong if his
true rebounding comes around.

Smith, one of the Parade elite and
a 1,400-point machine in high
school, enters Pitt as much regarded
a savior as Curtis Aiken, was last
season. The expectations proved
costly for Aiken —- excluding his
play in the NIT against LaSalle,
Florida State and Notre Dame —
who scored 3.6 points per game and
dished out 58 assists. _

Smith already has enough to con-
cern himself with, replacing all-time

scoring leader Clyde Vaughan, than '

to read about himself being com-
pared to Syracuse’s Dwayne ‘Pearl’
Washington. Relatively speaking

__ that is. '

He wasn’t being very prompt for a

I know, the transfer talk aimed at

that Wiley and his parents couldn't

Ex-player assists women’s

By Christine Kyle
The Pitt News

PITTSBURGH — Carol Dugan
from Cleveland isn’t much Older

‘than the members of the Lady

Panther basketball squad she works
with. In fact, she was once a team-
mate of the fourpsenior players on
the current squad.

The closeness in age couldibe a‘

hindrance for some coaches, but not
for Dugan, in her third season as
assistant women's coach. “Carol is
very important to our program,”
said 4 Head ' Coach Judy ‘ Saurer.
“She’s been able to blend the old and
the new:" Blending the old and the
new isespecially evident in the Lady
Panther’s defensive schemes.
“When I was a player here at Pitt,
I was really high on defense," Dugan

/said. “I guess my emphasis on

defense as a player carries into my
coaching.” The Lady Panther
defense is just one of the things that
benefits from Dugan’s‘ presence on
the staff. _ .-

“She’s very hard-working and
well linked,” Saurer said. “Her dedi-
cation as a player comes through
into her coaching. Carol’s a great
role model for the players.” ‘

And a role model she is. Despite a
collegiate career plagued by injuries,
Dugan was a four-year letterwinner
and a three-year starting guard for

the Lady Panthers. Hard work and
determination paid off as she com-
pleted her basketball career with 609
career points. ‘She still holds tenth
place on the all-time scoring chart.
Dugan was selected as the team’s
Most Valuable Player in 1982 and
was team captain for two seasons.
Dugan’s achievements aren‘t

limited to the basketball court. She
received her degree in studio arts
from Pitt and is presently taking
graduate courses at nearby
Carnegie—Mellon University. “Stay-
ing active academically is extremely
beneﬁcial,” Dugan said. “Also, in
coaching I'm learning a lot [from
Coach Saurer] about organization
and getting things done. She’s a
perfectionist.” ~

The youngest of six children,

"Dugan is not the only success in the
family. Her father is a cartoonist for

the Cleveland Plain Dealer and her
older brother Jimmy is a successful
lawyer. The entire Dugan clan
recently-competed in the Revco 10K

V Run. They all completed the race,

but Carol took family honors and
placed 32nd out of 1,300 runners.

But 10K" runs will have to be put
on hold as Dugan and the Lady
Panthers begin to prepare for the
1984-85 women’s basketball season.
The schedule is filled with challenges
from Big East rivals Villanova,
Seton Hall and Connecticut as well
as traditonal rival Penn State.

 basketball coach at Pitt

Carl Dugan, asszstant

coach, women’s basketball.

The competition is tough.But the

Lady Panthers have set their sights

on capturing the Big East crown this

‘ season. And Dugan knows what it

takes to be a winner.

"‘Aggressiveness, hustle and the-

desire and willingness to work hard
will lead to good communication
and teamwork,” Dugan said.
"‘That’s what we will strive for this
season."
