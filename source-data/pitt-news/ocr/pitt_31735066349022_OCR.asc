Armed Robbery Head
Campus Crime List

BY DAN KOHUT

Armed robbery and assault of a
student near the Frick Fine Arts
Building heads the Campus Police
incident report for the period of
September 23 to October 4.

Five youths attacked a young
woman, knocking her to the
ground, as she was about to leave
the campus, .on the evening of
September 23. '

The youths demanded the
student's money while threatening
her with a pistol.

' After taking her purse, -the
attackers ran through the Schenley

Plaza parking lot toward Hillman 4

Library.

All ﬁve were arrested by the
Campus Police a short time after
the incident, standing in front of

Aiken’s Restaurant on Forbes
Avenue. " -

The Campus Police said the
arrests of all ﬁve juveniles were
made on descriptions given by the
woman.

Other arrests by the Campus
Police included disorderly conduct
in Hillman Library on September
26 when a man exposed himself on
the Ground Floor and the ,harass-

ment of a young woman by a\

middle-aged man outside the
Student Union's Pine room.

The juveniles were arrested
during the last week of September
after they pried-open lockers in the

Benedum Hall, rumored to be
sinking, was built by contractors
who knew of poor geological

_ conditions under the site in 1964,

but steps taken to compensate for
these conditions, have proved
adequate _in preventing major
problems, according to Physical
Plant Project Manager George E.
Simmons. ‘
Simmons said underground

water springs‘ were known to be.
present when the 12-story building

_ was constructed.

“There are springs under
Benedum, but they were never a
real problem because actual water
flow is minimal,” Simmons said.
“A pump located in the basement
at the northwest stairtower pulls
what little water there is outside.”

“We have pumps under the old
chemistry building on that hillside,
too, and there's never been any
rumors, about it falling ‘down the
hill,” said Simmons, who also
discounts the rumors Benedum’s
foundation is cracking because it
can’t support the weight of the
building. _

“Cracks are standard,” Sim-
mons said. “New, buildings‘ will
crack and shift for several years,
but that doesn't mean»Bene’dum"s
going to topple onto_Fifth Ave-
nue.”

Original blueprints calling for a
steel piling foundation for the
engineering hall were abandoned
when it was decided the bedrock
would not be able to support it.

Dorm Security System

Seeks SGB Approval A 

BY TOM WASELESKI

A new dorm security plan
including a student security patrol
will be presented to the Ofﬁce of
Residence Life, pending approval
by the Student Government Board
(SGB) this Wednesday evening,

' according to Board member Chip

Hubbard.

‘ The plan would be an alternative
to the new student escort‘ policy
that goes into effect at 8 pm.

The proposed plan, would use
student marshals employed by» the
work-study program to assist the
deslg attendants at security doors
and to patrol, residence halls and
stairwells.

“The student marshals would
not act as campus police,”
Hubbard said. “Their job would be
to deter trespassers and report
suspicious people and actions to
the campus police.”

A “Students don’t like the idea of
police walking around their dorms.
Student participation (through stu-
dent marshals) would make other
students more aware of the
problems involved in security.”

Hubbardsaid he was dissatisﬁed
with the current security system

«because of the locked security

doors between Towers B and C, the
student escort policy, and the small
amount of student input that went
into the plan which was formulated
in the summer.

Hubbard's plan is the result of a
survey made at 93 urban universi-
ties. So far 24 have replied,

sending descriptions of their own
security systems. Duquesne,
UCLA, ‘Illinois, Syracuse and
Florida State are among the schools
using student marshals. '

“Student marshals. at other
schools seem to work well as long
as there's a working relationship-
with the police and the housing
ofﬁce,” Hubbard said. - ‘

PPU Reps. Call. for Union   

BY DAVE KIRSHNER’

Undergraduate students at_ Pitt
would have more to say about their

curriculum if the Union of Graduate '

Employees (UGE) could obtain a
contract, according to members of
two other graduate employe unions
from Michigan and Wisconsin.
Nancy Conklin, president of the
Graduate Employee Organization
(GEO) at the University of
Michigan and Mark Fuerst, a
representative from the Teaching
Assistants Association (TAA) at the
University of Wisconsin explained

Clinical experience in area

according to Med-X coordinator
and creator Adriana Salvaggio.

The program, open to graduate

Friday that students at their
respective institutions have the
opportunity to gain more mobility
and a control of the curriculum as a
result of provisions included in
their contracts. ‘

The UGE, which is a subdivision
of the Pitt Professional Union and
was formed to represent the caucas
of Pitt’s Teaching Assistants _(TAs)
and Teaching Fellows (TF5), is
awaiting the decision of the Labor
Board as to whether or not they are
employes in the eyes of the law,
according to PPU spokesperson Joy
Ostrowski.

If the Board afﬁrms the UGE’s
belief that they are employes, then
the graduate employes would have
the right to hold a collective
bargaining election.

“This election could ultimately
allow the UGE to- negotiate a
contract,” explained PPU spokes-
man Bob Nelson._ C

According to .Fuerst, the TAA
was the ﬁrst graduate employe
union to obtain a contract. It has
had a contract with the University
of Wisconsin for over ﬁve years.

Provisions of the TAA’s 1974
contract that would have a direct

“—In the past, the University had
said “no” to the last proposal
because it was felt that if students
had a say in organizing courses the
results would be classes like ‘How
to Read Magazines,’ ” Fuerst said.
“Some recent studies have shown,
though, that when students are
involved in the planning of their
own curriculum they call for more
stringent conditions.”

“The studies also show that

students who participate in organi-
zing a course, have a much greater
interest in the execution of the
course,” Fuerst added.

Conklin’s GEO experienced the
same problems as the UGE is
facing in its attempt to obtain a
contract. The GEO went so far as
to strike to gain their contract.

“We realize that all students are
being caught in the vice of
educational economization. Of
course, this directly affected us.
We tried very hard to get a
contract, but the University would
not grant it. So we struck with a
considerable amount of student
support,” Conklin explained.

“Today, the GEO is working
within its contract to finalize ideas
which include: the "planning of
courses that are solely designed by
students, taking broad. ideas and
scaling them down so they can be
designed into conceivable courses,
and to have TAs included in the
teaching of these new classes,”
Conklin said.

“Some TAs have no idea of
what’s happening when they go
into their classes,” said Conklin.
“Some have actually had no
previous teacher’s training. This
situation can do nothing but hurt
the quality of education being
presented to students.”

were drilled into the bedrock and
construction continued.

During the course of the six and
a half year project, O'Hara Street
was cracked by the weight of the
foundation, windows were inexpli-
cably blown in, and a construction
company ofﬁcial was killed when a
crane pulled a portion of the sixth
floor to the ground.

“Every construction job has its
problems," said a spokesman for
the General State Authority (GSA)
who wished to remain unidentiﬁed,
"And Benedum is no exception,
but everything is under control
now."

A GSA architect designed the
building.

The Fuller Construction Com-
pany, the New York-based contrac-
tor who built Benedum, disagrees.
The company ﬁled claims of
$1,922,811 against the GSA for
what it considered faulty design.
But, according to Deeter-Ritchey
architect Samuel Zionts, nothing
ever came of the suit.

“The people I dealt with in the
Fuller Company are no longer
around,” said Zionts. ‘‘I think that
the company’s almost defunct.
They've sold out on most of their
contracts and are just aboutout of
business." .

support Benedum. ‘The Fuller
Company, according to the GSA,
was merely trying to make excuses
for building delays.

The Michael L. Benedum Hall of
Engineering was planned in

October. 1964. after the Claude
Worthington Benedum Foundation
donated a million dollars to the Pitt ’
Engineering School. The General
State Authority paid for the balance

Students and

Paychecks

The charges made by Student Government Board President Larry
Platt concerning the arbitrary treatment of student employes cannot go
unanswered by employers at the Towers Cafeteria and Burger Chef.

To rennin silent would be a conﬁrnntion of shoddy management and
an inability to treat student employes as employes and not as some
fortimates chosen from a vast supply of coolie labor.

After all, the managers aren’t being asked to grapple with the
hard—nosed questions of higher pay or fringe beneﬁts, just the basic
workaday duties of handing out paychecks on time and setting wages

according to the amount of work done.

Despite the differences between student life and the alleged
“normal” life, ~ students have bills of their own to pay and
responsibilities enough without having to chase down managers for an
overdue paycheck. And even if they didn’t, it’s only fair that if a
worker puts in his or her time on time, he or she will be paid on time.

It doesn’t take a professional arbiter to tell what’s nomial business
practice and what’s not. Perlnips the fact that there is a tremendous
poolofstudentswhowouldbemorethanwillingtotake over thejobs of *KBcl.§lL
afew who quit because of frustration with their employers makes a

difference in the nmiager’s attitudes.

This is uitfortunateksince it’s naivete like this that breeds unionism.
Workers, and in this case-student workers, are avid enough to look
after their own interests, especially when they're freshly reminded of

exploitation every day.

It would be a terrible result of this conﬂict» if a union of student
employes had to be formed. Students and managers have better things

to do than negotiate contracts.

The best solution lies in drawing up a set of regulations for
employers with regard to student working hours and pay, as suggested

,byLarryPlatt. '

The need for a CIA

BY W. JACK ROMBERG

The American public has an
annoying habit of grabbing an
issue and letting emotionalism run
wild in dealing with it. Recent
investigations into the CIA have
spurred a new round of irrational
proposals. .

A typical analysis of the CIA runs
as follows. Since the CIA has
perpetrated certain evil acts, it
should no longer exist, because

That Throb in Your Head

BY JOHN METCALFB

This afternoon my radio told me “every seven

._\

radio also tells me that “advertising pays our bills.” ‘

 . The bills for something that is everywhere must be

considerable; I am entirely willing to let. whoever

_ wants to pay them.

But the message was disturbing. The woman who
spoke sounded quite sure of herself and of the
precision of the figure. Every seven seconds. Not
sometimes every eight or every six, with the law of

A ' averages making it all come out even, but always and
' V precisely every seven seconds a headache sprouted.

, The woman’s voice and the polish of the ad

f 2 ‘suggested this was a national and not merely a local
 problem. It was every seven seconds across the

. ~ »who1e<;breadth, length and noncontiguous extensions

 -_ of the nation that one headache occured every seven

' "--I-‘Lseconds. -The sponsor,~a well-known (what else?)

-manufacturer of analgesics, had prepared the script

«carefully and accurately.
r < Many years ago, by multiplying the number of
" seconds in a minute (60) by the number of minutes in

an hour (60), and multiplying the product by the

‘ —' ..number of hours in a day (24).I calculated there are

86,400 seconds in a ‘day. I no longer remember why I

, ’ wanted to know this in the original instance, but the
-painful labor involved in the computation assured

that the number would remain in my mind. -No doubt
Ithought it would eventually come in handy for
something.

Ithas. Inmy otherwise wasted youth, when I was
working_out the number of seconds in a day, I also
learned a rough sort of long division. Now, if we
divide seven seeonds[the precise interval between
headaches] into 86,400, we come up with rather more
»thanv12,000 as a quotient, and a remainder that I
will retain. Twelve thousand is an enormous number

of headaches: I hope I never have that many,

' certainly not on any one given day.

However, if we share them among the rathermore
than two hundred million of us, the burden becomes
almost bearable? Each of us can expect a headache
roughly every 15 or 16 thousand days. I am
comforted. I have had mine, only a few years ago. I
should be nearly 50 years before the next one strikes.

Having been comforted, I am inclined to wonder

why the drug company has told us’ all this. After all, -

advertising pays the bills of radio. While radio is
cheaper than television, it is scarcely free.

Again I have calculated. -_.I assume the drug
company to be honest, if not ethical. [Digression--In
most current dictionaries, about the third definition
of “ethical” pertains to drugs available only through
medical profession. That is, * prescription
drugs--which are not advertised on the radio.]

.Now-, if there are only“ l2,000theadaches per day‘,
and if they are all soothed by the advertised nostruin,
and if, as they claim, two tablets will do the job, we
have another problem. I

If ‘there are 12,000 headaches‘ per day, and if all of

them are relieved with this pill, and if two pills are -

required for relief, then the daily demand for the pills‘
is 24,000.

The pills commonly are available in retail outlets in
bottles of 24. Such bottles cost about 75 cents each.
Again arithmatic. The company must sell only about
1000 bottles of the pills per day. This would amount
to a gross income of $750. Daily. Presumably the
retailers take a share, though, and most likely some

— part of the $750 is spent on the manufacture and

distribution of the pills. I am left puzzled.

How can they afford to pay the bills of radio?

I may have found the answer. If I have a headache,
and if 2 of the 24tablets sufﬁce to cure me, then, in
the 40 or 50 years between now and my next
headache, the things may deteriorate to such an
extent‘ that I will be obliged to buy another bottle.

That must be it. It raises company income
twelve-fold at a single stroke, perhaps high enough
to afford the huge expense of keeping radio blaring.

Good Old Cloak

During the winter term of last
it was my unfortunate
displeasure to witness an accident
on Fifth Avenue in which one of my
fellow students was hit by a car.

The purpose of this letter is to
prevent a recurrence of such an

' event, because every day I see the

existed when this student was
injured.

Pitt students have a bad habit of
crossing against the traffic light at
the) crosswalk on Fifth Avenue

 

morning a large number of
students, including myself, -were
crossing Fifth Avenue from both
sides while the flow of traffic still
had the right-of-way green light. I
saw no harm in this at the time,
since I knew that I could make it
across safely before the oncoming
traffic reached this particular
intersection. I was halfway across,
moving from the Cathedral of
Learning towards Clapp Hall, when
this student flew past me, running
full speed towards the Cathedral.

He ‘must’ have ‘been late for _a ela_ss,,
or a test, and in his haste hefhad '

 

apparently assumed that the traffic
light was in our favor for crossing,
because_ he never bothered to slow
down or look to make sure that the
conditions for crossing were really
all right. Well, as he passed me I
heard an engine roarlspeed up]. I
looked directly up at- the traffic

light and saw that it was yellow and ,

green. The guy in the car was

trying to beat the red light, and in

the process of doing so __he struck
the student.

It was a horrible sight, and I felt,

, and still "feel... a.,Sen_se,..0f personal.

v police were

guilt since Iwas‘ one ‘ofthe large"

these acts are contrary to the ideals
of American democracy. Also,
proponents of the CIA’s demise
frown on those who believe that a
CIA is necessary to counter the
KGB.

But those who deny the validity
of this argument (the CIA versus
the KGB), are denying the reality
of international politics. Simply
stated, if the United States wishes
to defend its interests abroad, then
a CIA, or something similar, is
necessary. C

Negative reaction to the CIA is
twofold. First, there are objections

‘to the CIA’s plots against Castro,

its interference in Chile and other
related incidents. The greater
outcry, however, is against the data
the CIA collects about individual

American citizens, and illegal
interference in the lives of
Americans.

The problem, then, is not

whether or not the CIA should
exist, but how a workable agency
can be constructed that will not
obstruct the lives of Americans‘,
and will not illegally interfere in the
internal affairs of other countries.

The ﬁrst step is to establish the
goals and purposes of the CIA. It
seems obvious its primary function
is one of information gathering.

. There are many methods of doing

this--satellites, surveillance ships,
spies, double agents, a whole
plethora of James Bond-style
tactics the public not only accepts,
but enjoys.

‘ The scope of this information
gathering should be limited to
foreign interests. If there are any’
leads "into the United States, the
information should be taken to the
attorney general’s office and dealt
with from there. I -«

Another function "of the CIA‘ is
that more nebulous area of
protecting America’s interests
abroad. Here the CIA should be
much more limited. Its activities
should consist entirely of counter
propaganda and .working with
sywnpathetie elements within ano-
ther country, not by coercion, but
cooperation. '

. Further, limits-lmustlbe placed on

‘ who would get this support. In

other words, the CIA should not
align itself with anyone, on either
.the left or the right, who would

'7,’

and Dagger

merely substitute one dictatorship
for another. '

This all sounds very idealistic,
and there exists the great headache
of enforcing the guidelines just set
down. However, two

make the situation a little easier to
handle.

The most important would be to
increase the rights of Americans to
know what information, if any, the
CIA, or any agency, has on them.
A “right to examine your ﬁle law”
should be passed to grant any
American the right to go and look
at his or her CIA file, if they have
one.

A second measure would be to
require a full investigation of the
«CIA to be carried out at the end of
every decade. This investigation
would be mandated to
whatever witnesses it felt neces-
sary, and to indict if anything was
uncovered. The investigating body
could be attached either to
congress or the Attorney General’s
office.

The responsibility for any uncov-
ered wroiigdc-izig, and the legal
consequences which would follow,
would fall on those who gave
and carried out the illegal order.
Hopefully, this would create a
situation within the CIA in which
an agent could consciencously
refuse to carry out an order on the
grounds it was illegal and he or she
could be prosecuted for it.

a forum for dealing with the CIA

should be enough -to deter most

illegal. actions.

Many will argue that this system
would not be tight enough, that the
CIA could too easily trick Ameri-

- cans out of their right to know-, and

that there are ways to get around
an investigating body. Whileit is
true that no system is airtight, and
so Americans will still be taken
advantage of, Watergate recently
proved no one can get away with
everything all the time.

Still others will claim that they do
not care how the United States
conducts its foreign policy, or
whether it has one at all. These

people are , probably "the most\_/rt’

dangerous of all, for neo-isolation-
ism_ is the surest way to ’everyone’s
mutual destruction.

_ As the crowd gathered around,
and while I stood dumbfounded in
the middle of Fifth Avenue, some

Losing sight of their mission

The Failure of BlackFrats

BY BOB LaPRINCE

Black students for too long have
addressed themselves largely to
matters of fashion, dope and
stereos, while refusing _to address
themselves to intellectual develop-
ment and scholarship. Black
* students too often feel the only way
they can relate to each other at a
white university is by dropping acid
or getting some innocent, young
sisters to drop their d_rawers.
Although under other conditions
and circumstances these maybe
considered as meritorious activi-
ties, they do little to assure the

’ academic, social and political

mobility of the black male or female
student at this university. I am not
one for criticizing anyone’s style of
life, but I do feel rather strongly
that black students ought to, do
something to minimize activities
that interfere with, limit and/or
obstruct their intellectual growth
and development. Furthermore,
minority students should stop
being so defensive about their
supposedly intellectual inabilities
and do something about them.
One way of doing something is to
refuse to associate with collegial
elements who find it more
“manly” to beat and intimidate

;??‘7_"‘people than to aide them in their

growth, bot-h intellectual and
spiritual. They would be better off
not submitting to the wishes of
people who manifest their psycho-
logical deprivation and needs on
the unsuspecting mind of the
novice minority student. Don’t get
me wrong. I am not a-chauvinistic
pig. Sororities and fraternities are
equally guilty of failure-- to
communicate to their members and
potential members the. leadership,
scholarship and moral characteris-
tics so necessary for the elevation
of themselves and of black people
at this university and in the world.
The fraternities and sororities,
particularly those at Pitt, have
failed historically to inform the
academic and larger Pittsburgh
communities of their intentions to.
live up to high scholastic and moral
ideas. They frequently engage in
and have “‘ pledgees engage in
frivolous and oftentimes‘ embaras-
sing actions that further induce
stereotyping of blacks. Fraternities,
and sororities often make loud
proclamations and acclamations
about their university and com-
munity services. Close, dispass-
ionate inspection shows that there
is a marked difference between
their claims and their service
goals-actualization. More degrad-
ing and barbaric is the practice,
though publicly denied, of submit-
ting pledgees’ buttocks and faces‘

to malicious and often violent
attacks. None of the fraternities
and sororities can document
instances in which this is not true.
Their contribution to the university
and their fellow black students
leaves so much to be desired, one
wonders about the actual function
of these groups -and their reasons
for being. Or are they still clinging
to the noble precepts and philoso-
phies of their founding fathers and
mothers (which to this day are still
unenforced political trivia)?

Now
aforementioned. But they are
probably so entrenched in their
organizations that the truth could
bypass them and they could not
even know it, Another reason why
some might deny the validity of the

truth hurts. There is no denying

that the pink and green is’ just as a

blue and white, purple and gold

is like adding salt to_an open and
historically fresh wound.

nities and sororities need to

reaffirm by actions the principles

What I recommend is that:

1) Membership be restricted to
students who have demonstrated
outstanding academic competence,
eg, at least 2.8 average for all
potential members.

2] Regular public forums be held
to discuss the programs and
policies of all black Greek

and concentrated efforts to improve ,

In this age of the middle

‘_ Seventies it seems apathy was the

"  the late Sixties.

_ Meeting with
frustration at every turn, last year’s

 protesters seemingly have turned
 into this year's silent majority;

pillage of American resources,_ and

 Boston racism.
 ” 1 But the Sixties were not merely a

spawning ground for apathy, for
out of the smoldering ruins of the

 people who chose an alternative

largely ignored by the major
media, but every year a slate of‘
candidates runs for political office,
from President down to Pittsburgh
City Council. .

Their platform is basically one of
“Peace and Freedom.” They
promise a change to a Socialist
society that will be more democrat-
ic and freer than the one we have
now.

But many Americans equate
socialism with the Communist
Party" and thus with the Soviet

_Union, and think since the Soviet

Union is so obviously undemocrat-
ic, the Socialists must be boldfaced
liars to talk about a Socialist -society
being the most democratic.

. Neil Berns and Steffi Brooks,
Socialist candidates for county
commissioner, and Mark Satinoff,
the only Socialist member of Pitt
Student Government, argue that
this is a gross misconception; -

“The Communist Party exists to ‘

support -the bureaucracy in the
Soviet Unin, not the interests of the

workers," Berns asserts. “It is not’

an honest program/ for socialist
transformation."

Further, the Communist Party
feeds the Red Mania mentality that
started'in the Fifties.

“The Communist Party apolo-

gizes for the lack of democracy in ‘

the Soviet Union. This sets up the
entire left for red baiting,” Brooks
says. .
If it is true Socialists are not
totalitarians in disguise, then who
are they, what do they really
believe in, and where do they
comegfrom? The answers are
varied.

Neil Berns, a steel worker in the
Clairton steel mill, was first

exposed to social change in the .

early Sixties "when he took part in a
strike for equal rights in the
construction industry in New York.

As late as 1968 he campaigned for

turned off by conventional politics.

“The more I thought about it,
what these liberal Democrats’
policies and politics were really

‘like, it became apparent that there

was no fundamental difference

between the McGovern's and the 

conservatives."

Mark Satinoff‘s and Steffi
Brooks‘ stories are similar to
Berns'. Satinoff was originally into
the countercultural movement, but
got involved in social change when
he realized changing his own life
style was not enough. Change had
to come in society.

“It was easy to see that Vietnam
was not an isolated incident or
mistake, but a_conscious planned
out policy,” says Satinoff. .

Brooks comes from a family
with socialist sympathies, so she
was aware of society’s ills at an
early age. But the turning point for
her also came with the anti-war
demonstrations.

Having made at least a partial
commitment, there are .\ several
ways to get involved in the socialist
movement. For Brooks and
Satinoff it was through the Young
Socialist Alliance(YSA). Though
not ofﬁcailly tied to the SWP, the
YSA does campaign for SWP
candidates,
‘Militant,’ a Socialist newspaper.

The YSA chapter at Pitt was
started about 2 ’ years-ago, and
has run into ‘opposition from the
Student Government bureaucracy
since its inception. At first the
Committee on Student Organiza-
tions refused .to recognize ‘it,

and distributes the

MARK SATINOFF

contending its purpose was redun-

dent with that of the now defunct
SDS. - .

After ﬁnally gaining recognition,
the YSA received only a minimal
funding from the Allocations

_ Committee, only enough to sponsor

one speaker. In each of the last two
years. Socialist candidates ran for
Student Government Board, and in

each year they. had trouble with the

elections committee.

Mark Satinoff feels that this
opposition is due to “the fact that
they(Student Government) know
we are serious about what we are
doing. We put out a program of
democratizing student government
which threatens the very values
that many of the members of SGB

_ and allocations hold."

' SWP candidates also have run
into trouble with the state and
country bureaucracies.

“The more I thought about it...it became apparent that there was no ~
fundamental difference between the .McGoverns and the

conservatives.”--Neil Berns.

STEFFI BROOKS

“The number-one hassle all
SWP candidates have been put
through so far," says candidate
Berns, "is having to get thousands
and thousands of petition signa-
tures to get on the ballot."

According to Berns, Democratic
and Republican candidates need
far fewer signatures to get on the
ballot.

Despite the hassles from the’

bureaucracy, and snubbings from
the major media, the Socialist
campaigns go forward via a wide
distribution of their own literature,
and street campaigning.
Perennially, Socialist candidates

lose by large margins. But people '

are not totally unreceptive to their
ideas, as Steffi Brooks found
while campaigning at the picket
line of the social service workers’
strike.

“The people on the picket line
were furious, they were furious
with Shapp, furious with AFL-CIO.
When people heard I was a
Socialist candidate who supported
their strike, there were comments
going up and_ down the line...
‘Throw‘ those Democrats and
Republicans out...they‘re exactly
l thought these were
Socialiststalking." _

But most of the working class is
aligned not with the social services,
but with heavy industry, mining
and construction, those unions are
notoriously conservative. How
does the SWP propose to influence
these workers over the influence of
the union leaders?

“I think we have to draw a
distinction between the union
members and the union bureau-
crats," Berns answers. “We have

‘ in this country...business union--

ism, where the union misleaders
are really more concerned about
the interests of the corporations
rather than the members.”

The SWP, then, tries to build a
class movement of workers by
appealing to the rank‘-and ﬁle,
supporting strikes, and pointing
how the union leaders really mean
to desert them.

The Socialist Movement A

(Continued from Page 6)

It is hard to objectively assess
the possibility of the Socialist ever
attaining their goals. The major
stumbling blocks--that many peo-
ple are satisfied with the status
quo, and that the elements they are
trying to recruit have a history of
conservatism, at least in politics--
seem almost insurmountable.

And yet the Socialists. speak
confidently of acheiving a “Social-
ist transformation of society."
They see each issue of oppression
and workers demands as an
expression of a sick capitalist
society. And they have an almost
religious dedication to the belief
that these social ills can be solved
only through Socialism. .

Indeed, the idea that human
values will be the number-one
values of society seems almost
mystical when one considers how
many times humanity has been

promised that before, and how ”

many times it has been disappoint-
ed.
Add thisfeeling of frustration to

‘Socialist,’ and suddenly the
dreams of the Socialists seem very
naive. But naivete is often a
two-edged sword.

them wear standardized clothes or
something ridiculous like that,"

Suddenly, the idea seems less
frightening.

It seems clear that the Socialists,
at least those in the SWP, are
serious aboutxtheir work. That
many people and much of the
media do not take them seriously is
unfortunate, because right or
wrong, Socialism represents an
ideology still relevant to today's
problems. ,

So the Socialists will continue to
lose landslide elections, and,
campaign for the oppressed until

Like most things, the cost of  

attending medical school
has risen sharply
overthe last
decade. To many
medical students
that cost repre-
sents a heavy
burden, a financial
problem that can
affect your con-
centration.

It needn't be
that way. The ‘
Armed Forces
Health Professions
Scholarship Program
was originated to
free you from those
worries. Men and
women who qualify
will have the costs of
their medical educa-
tion covered, and

- will also receive a
substantial monthly
allowance.

The program offers
more than tuition and
salary; it offers you the
opportunity to begin
your practice under very

favorable conditions. As a health care officer in
the military branch of your choice, you ll_ find _
yourself with responsibilities fully in keeping with
yourtraining, and with the time and opportunity to
observe a full spectrum of medical specialties.

When you decide on the specialty you wish to
pursue, you may find yourself taking those
graduate medical studies at one of our many
large and modern medical centers. If so, you can
count on that training being second to none.
Both the clinical and research work being done
in them have made.Army, Navy and Air Force
hospitals a major new national medical resource.

' At the beginning of next month,
the 1975-76 season of the Univer-
sity Theatre will get under way
with a presentation of Arthur
Miller’s A View From the Bridge

an explicitly American piece of

‘tion of one of this

theatre from the dramatic imagina-
country’s
greatest playwrights. This initial
production, one of four to be seen
at the Stephen Foster Memorial
Theatre between November of this
year and June of next, will set the
theme for the season as a
whole--“the American exper-
ience.”- '

A View From the Bridge,

A ' opening November 6, is a tragedy

set in classical form, constructed
around the inexorably self-destruc-
tive career of a New York
longshoreman, Eddie Carbone. No
suspense is generated from the
possibilities of Eddie’-s fate as the
drama moves to its inevitable
conclusion.

Eddie? s story was told to Miller
by a waterfront worker and the
playwright’s purpose in making it
into a piece of theatre was not to
make us shed tears for Eddie as an

,; individual whose personal failure is
I somehow ' disembodied from the
; society of which «he is part, but to
-p be able to allow us, the audience, to
7 conceptualize for ourselves the
: machinery within which Eddie acts

out his own defeat.
Miller writes of Eddie that it

v  Shot & Beer Myth

Drowns Pgh.Dance

BY A. IRENE SCHMIDT

During the current Pittsburgh Symphony strike, professional dance
has been “postponed." More bluntly, there is none.

There is no justiﬁcation for the current situation--the concentration
of dance in this city into one unit, the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre. The
same cliched reasons are being given for this situation, and they hold
as little water now as they have for the past few years.

A favorite excuse for the lack of alternatives to the Pittsburgh Ballet
Theatre is the old “Pittsburgh is a shot-and—beer town” theory.
According to this rationale, Pittsburghers cannot be expected to
support or _enjoy any form of cultural’ entertainment because the
population is composed solely of the stereotypical “millhunk” who
wants nothing more out of life than to settle down to a long eveningof
Bob Prince armed with a can of Iron City.

What a load of crap! Take a closer look at this city. Pittsburgh is the
home of one of the largest medical complexes in the East. The

hundreds of people who work in the various hospitals are nots,

“millhunks.” p
Within the perimeters of the city, there are at least five ‘colleges and

_ universities. The University of Pittsburgh is the largest employer in
A the city. Very few of these employees would qualify as “millhunks."

Neither are they sadly underpaid.

Another source of afﬂuent and educated people in Pittsburgh lies in
the large number of corporations headquartered here. Not all of the
executives of Alcoa, US Steel and Heinz are planning to spend their
lives vegetating in front of the TV.

‘Taking the large concentration of educated persons living and
working in Pittsburgh into account, the image of the “shot-and-beer"
town is nothing more than an empty excuse for lack of initiative on the
part of the means and responsibility to entertain Pittsburgh residents.

Another excuse for the lack of alternative dance groups in Pittsburgh
is simply that there is no opportunity, no talent, no audience. That
same argument was advanced for live theatre when the Pittsburgh
Playhouse closed its doors in the spring of 1974. Since that time a
variety of theatre groups have blossomed. On the traditional side,
groups such as Camelot Productions and the White Barn Theatre are
increasing their strength. Experimental“ theatre has ﬂowered in
Oakland through the Lab Theatre. And one year after the death of the
Playhouse, the city once again has professional theatre, the Pittsburgh
Public Theatre. Why shouldn’t the same be true for dance?

Presently, the situation is stagnant. The Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre
has professional dance all wrapped up. Groups such as the Dance
Guild of Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh Dance Council bring in
performers, mostly from New York. The Guild also provides lessons.

If nothing else, these groups are trying. But as long as there is no
opportunity for young dance talent to stay in this area, Pittsburghers
will continue to be deprived of an important facet of the arts. And the
vicious cycle will continue until the many wealthy, educated people in
this city shake off their lethargy and see to it that local dance groups
are sponsored, publicized and supported. As it stands, no one is giving

I Pittsburgh a chance.

Univ. Theatre Sets ‘American’ Plays

(Continued from Page 8)

Another drama with an explicitly
American setting we shall hope-

- fully have the chance to see next

summer is Kennedy’s Children by
Robert Patrick. This play is
centered around ﬁve characters
who spend an afternoon sharing
their experiences of living through
the Sixties and how they now come
to be sharing that most fearful time
of day, late afternoon, in a rundown
bar somewhere in_gManhattan.
Richard Mennen who planned to
direct this play is still attempting at
this point to obtain amateur rights
for a University production. Ken-
nedy’s Children when it. initially

E opened at the New York Center for

the Performing Arts last year was
generally ignored bythe critics and
the New York audiences and only
lasted two weeks. It was not until it
was transferred to the relative
obscurity of a small stage at the
King’s Head Tavern in Islington,
London, under the direction of
Clive Donner. that the play began
[0 achieve something of a reputa-

tion.

Clive Barnes, the drama critic for
the New York Times saw the
London production and decided
that it was a piece of theatre that
everyone who had l_ived through
the Sixties should see. Together
with that accolade, the adulation
the production received from the
London papers provided sufﬁcient

impetus for the return of Ken-

nedy’s Children to New York,
where it will shortly re-open.
Because amateur rights are not
generally released until the touring
possibilities of a successful play
have been fully explored, it seems
the case that unfortunately Ken-
nedy’s Children will not be
available for a University produc-
tion next year. Mennen is ready to
look for an alternative to this play,
which quite unexpectedly and
almost overnight, became a hit.
Perhaps the most ambitious
production scheduled for the new
season is Steel/City, a musical
documentary on the history of steel
in Pittsburgh, conceived by theatre

arts faculty members Gillete
Elvgren and Attilio Favorini. Over
six months have already been spent
gathering information for Steel/
City, often from primary sources,
such as the recollections of J&L
pensioners and the anecdotes of
retired union leaders and business
executives. The dramatic script
will incorporate the actual recollec-
tions of such men.

Steel/City will have three acts,
the first describing the “pre-
history" of the city and how at one
time the water-tonnage moving
along the Allegheny and Monon-
gahela rivers exceeded that of the
port of New York. The second act
will chronicle the “river-boat era,”
and explain how Pittsburgh came
to be one of the most important
steel-producing centers in the
world. The ﬁnal acts will take us
into the present with the creation of
such giant corporations as US
Steel.

One of the intentions of Elvgren
in drafting" such an ambitious
project was to get away from what

Out-Manned Cubs Fall    
To Potomac State

1 BY RICK STOUFFER
Sports Editor

It wasn’t (yawn) what you could
call (ZZZZZ) a game of tremendous
offensive display, but still, the Pitt
Panthers blanked the Duke Blue
Devils, 14-0, Saturday at the
stadium before 33,778 anticipating-

] . a-higher-score crowd.

Low score or not, the game did
‘answer a few questions for Head

1  ’ Coach Johnny Majors.

For starters, the defense is for
real! Last week in blanking
William and Mary, 47-0, it was
generally accepted the Indians

0 , weren’t exactly the Soonersfrom

the Southeastern Conference.
Some said the shutout bolstered
conﬁdence after losing to Okla-
homa but didn’t really mean a
whole lot.

Coach Majors was the first to

. admit it.

“.We knew William and Mary
wasn’t a powerful opponent and we
actually had better personnel than
they did.’’

,7; — I But Duke was a whole new ball

game. The Blue Devil offense was

 competent both in the air and on
the ground, which Majors impres-

sed upon his troops all week.
“We knew from the start Duke

* - -_ had a ﬁne team and could give us a

lot of problems.” ’

And from the beginning it
seemed both defenses might walk
away with a 0-0 tie. The Pitt

‘ offense, despite the ﬁne running of

quarterback Robert Haygood,
could get no farther than the Duke
42 while the Blue Devils made it all
the way to the Pitt 41 in the ﬁrst
quarter.

Early in the second quarter the
Panthers found themselves starting

 Pin Wins  
 At Ashland

BY RALPH SPARKLE

Former Ringgold track star Mel
Boyd set a new course record of
24:l8 for ﬁve miles, leading the Pitt

’ Panther Cross—Country Team to
victory at the Ashland l11vitational
last Saturday.

A warm sunny, autumn morning

’ and a fast, dry course were the

perfect ingredients for Pitt’s
second consecutive victory. These
ideal conditions helped Pitt place
six runners in the top eight to lead
the team scoring with 17 points,
followed by Western Ontarios 75,
Buffalo State's 82, and Ashland’s
95.

Mel 'Boyd, taking the lead for
good after three miles, went on to
- win easily. “I could have run a few
more miles," Boyd said. “I felt
relaxed and was surprised no one
was with me at the end."

Boyd was followed by Nick
‘Martin, Dave McDonald and Tom
Herrmann, who all ﬁnished well

" ahead of Western Ontario's Olym-
pic Steeple prospect, Joe Sax. Pitt
got out in front at the start and
never strayed from the lead.

Coach Mike Agostinella com-
mented, “We successfully com-
pleted the second step on our way
to an undefeated season.
undefeated season. The guys all
ran very strong. Each meet the
competition gets tougher, but so
does Pitt!”

Freshman Bob Lee was hindered
by lack of spikes but Terry Wile

and Ron Wiriek ﬁnished seventh

and eighth respectively to give the

Panthers the depth to win easily.

Pitt meets its next competition at
Flagstaff Hill, Schenley Park this
Friday. when West Virginia tries to
 trip up the undefeated harriers.

in the hole following a Duke punt
that was downed at the three. But
the “Hawk,” Tony Dorsett, broke
over right guard for a pickup of 13
and a big first down. Duke’s
defense settled down and once
again the Panthers punted.

Six plays later, after not being
able to pick up a first down, the
Devils gave up the ball and this
time Haygood and Company went
to work.

In 10 plays--the highlights being
a 23-yard keeper by Haygood and a
20-yard toss to his favorite target,
tight end Jim Corbett--the Pan-
thers had a ﬁrst and goal at the
Duke one.

Haygood, following the block of
center John Pelusi, went into the
end zone with 2:11 left in the half
with Carson Long adding the point
after. *

The third stanza was again a
scoreless duel although the Blue
Devils came within inches of tying
the game. ‘ ._

Midway through the stanza Duke
quarterback Bob Corbett, alterna-
ting a running attack with Bob
(cousin of Greg) Pruitt, Tony
Benjamin and Larry Martinez plus
key passing to flanker Chuck
Williamson, had a first and ten at
the Pitt 13.

But the Pitt pass rush, as it had
all day, made Corbett hurry his
throw just enough so comerback
Leroy Felder could intercept in the
end zone and kill the Blue Devils’
biggest threat of the ball game.

Pitt again dominated the ﬁnal 12
minutes, scoring the insurance
touchdown with 8:44 left in the
game.

first down on the Blue Devil 29.

Seven plays later Dorsett swept
the left end for the two-yard TD.
Long kicked his second extra point
ofvthe day with Pitt on top, 14-0.

Statistics told the story for the
game. Duke could manage only 33
net yards rushing while the
Panthers garnered 251. The
passing department went the other
way as the Blue Devils outdueled
Pitt, 191 to 33. .

“Although they,didn’t_ score on
us (the ﬁrst time Pitt has posted
back-to-back shutouts since 1945)
their offense deﬁnitely gave us
problems,” Majors ‘said. “It
wasn’t an explosive offense but the
kind that picks you apart.”

Quarterback Haygood had his
best game of the season as he
rushed for 80 yards on 19 carries
while completing two passes for 33
yards.

“This was Haygood’s loosest
game of the season,” Majors
explained. “Duke was giving him
a lot of chances to keep the ball and
run upﬁeld which he did.” Our
offense had to take the pressure off
the defense today and I think they
did.

“Defensively I'm delighted with
the shutout. I think their pressure
got more intense as the game went
on and I would say this is the best
defense we’ve had in our three
years here at this stage in the
season.”

The game (yawn) might not have
exactly been an eye opener, but it
did prove the Panther defense AND
offense are deﬁnitely for real.

Temple Owls Outduel

BY JIM LEWIS

Who said owls aren't carnivor-
ous?

The Temple Owls showed they
are meat eaters by pecking away at
the Pitt Panthers, 2-], in a soccer
matc_h last Saturday. _

The game started out well for
Pitt; a pass from the left of the
Temple net found the Panthers’
leading scorer Al Jutca in front.
Jutca bounced the ball over the
sprawled Owl goalie for his ﬁfth
goal of the season. Pitt led at
halftime, 1-0.

But it's hard to keep a good team
down, especially a team which hails
from Philadelphia, a city where
soccer is more popular than Kate
Smith.

The Owls came out in the second
half with their feathers obviously
ruffled. Their offense put
uneeasing pressure on the Pitt
defense from the beginning to the
end of the second half, at times
attacking more like hawks than
owls. But the Panther defense held
on to the slim one-goal lead.

Until the last few minutes of the
game, that is.

The tough Temple barrage of
shots ﬁnally paid off for the Owls.

After wearing out the tired Pitt
defense with its persistent offense,
Temple erupted for two late-period
comeback goals to beat a dejected

Panther soccer team,‘ 2-1.

' It was the second straight victory

for Temple. its ﬁrst a 2-0 shutout
against East Stroudsburg in last
week’s opener. — But more
important for the Owls, their win
, against Pitt showed the awesome
defense they displayed last year_ is

  Panther (Boaters

improvement on“last year’s l0-3-l
record a11d a bid to the NCAA
Championships.

The win was equally important
for Pitt, too. The close game
showed Pitt Coach Leo Bemis what
his team can do against a team of
Temple’s caliber.

“Temple plays an entirely
different game,” Bemis said.
“They can connect with long
diagonal passes between their
forwards--pro type soccer.”

The Panthers, whose record fell
to 3-2-1, will show what they can do
on October 11, when they travel to
Slippery Rock.

Then the Panthers could become
the "feaster" instead of the
"feastec."

The Grand Wazoo, in his bid for
immortality, ﬁnally has caught and

An out-manned Pitt Junior
Varsity football team fell to the
undefeated Potomac State(3-0)
Mountaineers 30-0 last Friday.

Coach Larry Holton showed
disgust with his team’s perfor-
mance. .

“Our offensive execution was
poor," he said. “Even when we
did have the holes, our backs
cou_ldn't hit them.”

At what could be its worst hour,
the offense failed to move the ball
into the end zone after a blocked
punt gave it the ball at the
Mountaineer 2-yard line.

Also contributing to the offensive
woes were three turnovers, which
led directly to Potomac scores.
Twice, the ball was lost inside
Pitt’s 10-yard line.

Defensively, the Cubs held their
own, led by monsterman Mark
O’Toole and defensive tackle Scott
Hartman.

Receiver Ken Dapp was the lone
bright spot for the offense,
grabbing ﬁve aerials for 62 yards.

After watching the JV’s record
slip to 0-1-1, Holton had some
discouraging words for the junior

varsity system.

“It’s tough," he explained.
“We are just dupes for the varsity.

We don't get time to practice our
own plays."

Another problem encountered by
Holton is the lack of quality
players.

“We have to use mostly
walk-ons,” Holton said. “Our
whole backfield was guys just
trying out on their own.”

Even the freshmen, where JV
squads usually get most of their
meat. were missing.

More than half of the freshmen
on scholarship dressed for the
varsity thispast weekend.

The situation does not seem any
better for next weekend when the
Cubs travel to Kent State for a
game with the Golden Flashes.

_ “lt’s going to be the same think
all over again," Holton said.
“Most of the freshmen are going

with the varsity (to, Temple) and 

we’ll have to go with what's left.”

Unless there is a drastic change
i11 the very near future, it’s going to
be a long, long season for Larry
Holton and his charges.

Holloway Is His Name a

Defense Is His Game

BY TOM HALL
Associate Sports Editor

After an uneventful ﬁrst half of
football, the Duke Blue Devils were
ready toplay. offense. They were
held to a total of two yards total
rushing in the ﬁrst two quarters
against the aggresssive Pitt defen-
sive front wall. ‘

So Duke QB Bob Corbett decided

the way to put his team on the-

board was with a flurry of passes.
The coverage was laying bae_k,
willing to give him the short pass.
But there was still that-defensive
front to contend with.

On a third and ten. Corbett
spotted his tight end running a curl
into the middle ofthc Pitt zone. He
cocked his arm and fired.
Meanwhile, Randy Holloway was
bus_v'cIin1bing his offensive tackle,
looking for an angle. He found that
angle, reached his peak at the
precise moment, and batted the
ball harmlcssly into the Duke
backfield. leaving the Blue Devils
another punting situation.

“He really didn’t throw the ball
too high," Holloway confessed.
"With that tackle under me. I had
all the height I needed to reach it."

Holloway, 6-6, has the size to be
an excellent defensive lineman.
But size can be a handicap too.

“I have problems being this tall”
Holloway said. “Too many times I
come in standing straight up, and
that gives these smaller guys a
cha11cc to cut me in half. I have to
come in lower from now on, I get
better penetration that way."

llis rushing wasn't so bad
Saturday either. as Holloway
accounted for two ofthc tcam’s live
sacks of\Corbctt.

“I guess I had a good game
today, probably my best this year.
I’ve been working on my pass rush,
and it’s been getting better every
week.

"I think a lot is due to the fact
everyone else on the line is playing
better than before. If you don't

have to help cover for someone
else, ll'1e11 it's going to give you
more time to do what you're
supposed to do."

()l'parlicular i11te1'c-st in the Duke

game, was the way the defense
shut down its opponent's ground
game. “That's the story, the name
of the game" Holloway said. “Of
course that was our objective. If
they have to throw the football. that
puts the defense in better position
for a turnover."

Hasﬂolloway noted an improve-
ment in the Pitt defense? “Sure,
the defense is getting better, sort
of.”

Sort of‘?

"Well. I’d be the first to say
Duke was better offensively than
William a11d Mary was, but they
still should be considered lesser
competition. I hope we're better
now, and we'll be even better when
it comes dow11 to Notrc Dame or
Penn State.

“I like the best competition. I
enjoyed the challenge of playing
Oklahoma, and I thought we were
up to that challenge. ‘But taking
out what happened at Oklahoma on
teams like W&M aml Duke, just
can’t tell you how good you really
are.

"I think. or I'd like to think the
offciisc owes us one now. I think
the defense is carrying the team,
but I'd like to hope they'll pay us
back before the season is over."

And what of the future? Where
does the defense go from here?

“.I’m waiting for that big game
when welthe defensive squad] can

have the opportunity to prove
ourselves.”
“We are getting our game

together on the front line. We're
doing a lot more than we have in
the past. For instance, with Duke,
we did a lot of stunting. running
crosses. doing what we can to do
what we're doing now even better.
I think we're really starting to find
ourselves."

And the feat of two consecutive
shutouts, the first time since the
I945 season. .‘‘I get a kick out of a
shutout. because that's our game.
When we sl1ul the opposition out. it
makes us feel like we did our job.

"You have to figure" said

Holloway, “if we record a shutout,
then how can we lose?"
