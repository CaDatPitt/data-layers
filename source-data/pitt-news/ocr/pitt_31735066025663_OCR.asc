‘ What will it take to keep students at Pin?

Staff Writer

Robert Atkin remembers a time when uni-
versity students were just that —— students.

He remembers when only a handful .

worked more than 10 hours a week to pay the
bills. Now it seems wherever this business
professor turns, he meets students working full
time while they go to school. And it’s not just
adults, it’s full-time undergraduates.

"The realities of life here exceed simply
the opportunity to learn," Atkin said, as other
faculty members nodded their heads in silent

agreement at a meeting of faculty on Friday.

When faculty members from various
departments met last week to address the cli-
mate of Pitt's campus, the subject of working
students came up. So did such topics as the
price of books, creating a nurturing academic
environment, and bettering relationships
between students and their professors.

They found Pitt must work harder to not
only attract students, but to keep the ones
they’ve got happy and productive.

Like Pitt, many universities across the
nation have trouble keeping students.

David Epperson, dean of Pitt's School of

Social Work and current chair of the Campus
Climate Committee, called Pitt's attempt at
student retention "spotty at best.”

e But the provost’s ofﬁce formed the
Enrollment and Management Committee three
years ago to ﬁnd ways to make Pitt more com-
fortable and conducive to student life.

From recruitment to graduation, the
Enrollment and Management Committee
questions the satisfaction of students’ college
experience in and out of the classroom.

They’re looking at such things as gradua-
tion and retention rates, the relationship

The Campus Climate Committee will  to improve campus life for students. 

CLIMATE

between academic and student affairs,
the relationship between students and
faculty and tuition costs, according" to
chair Jack Daniel.

Its newest subcommittee, the
Campus Climate Committee, will exam-
ine some of the same things.

' At their second meeting, the com-
mittee discussed how exactly “campus
climate” could be deﬁned, since, in the
words of Daniel, it can be "an extremely
complex phenomenon."

In the coming weeks, faculty, staﬁ
and students will speak to the committee
about what campus climate means to
them. Through this, members hope to
identify Pitt’s weak and strong points.

Next, an outside consultant will
speak about how other universities deal
with the problem of campus climate.

Cooper said. “The president’s the vic-
tim. He can’t defend himself other than
to say they didn’t do anything. His
silence implies he’s guilty.”

During his summer at the White
House, Cooper said he never observed
or heard stories that the president made
sexual advances toward female interns.

If anything, Lewinsky was probably
obsessed with Clinton, Cooper theo-
rized. ’

“Often some of the other interns
would follow him, hoping to get a pic-
ture or a handshake, because few are
ever actually in the White House,”
Cooper said. “[Clinton] went out of his
way to make sure he said ‘hi,’ but was
always respectful.”

Cooper said he still wants to know A

more about the case because allegations
that Clinton purchased a dress and other
gifts for Lewinsky and footage of him
hugging her in public are very suspi-
cious.

“The president never bought any of

. -~..~.e._ w . .,.._,

us gifts,” Cooper said. “Sometimes;
aides would give you pens but that 
about it. I got some White Houseig
M&M’s that are wrapped in a special’;
package.” 
He said the hug proves Clinton we:
closer to Lewinsky than he was to othef
interns, but Cooper said he’d be “ver§
surprised and rnind-boggled if the preéf
ident was involved with her.” 
“If they did do it, it wasn’t

Editor's Note: This is the second story in
a three—part series an undergraduate

The images of the disheveled, reclusive

mad-scientist toiling into the wee hours of
the morning in a laboratory overﬂowing
with smoking beakers and bubbling liquids
are rather outdated.

"Course work will add to an apprecia-
tion of the research," Chrysanthis said. "We
do not want to intirnidate' students, but we
don't want to turn the experience into a tutor-
ing session either."

Montague was able to join the
researchers in the computer science depart-
ment because of a grant the department
received through the National Science
Foundation's Research Experience for
Undergraduates program '.

The ftmding enables the department to
focus on involving undergraduates in the dis-
covery process, Chrysanthis said.

Montague, who

December with a

work with various
computer programs
prepared her for a

New England.

"I was consider-
ing graduate school and there you have to do
research," she said. "I wanted to see ifl had
the ability to think like a researcher. I wanted
to see if I ﬁt into that way of life."

Montague said she was unsure about
being a researcher, but she is certain that she
knows more now than before she got
involved with research projects at Pitt.

“When I was doing my experiments, I
found myself wishing that I had taken more
classes before I started my research. When I
did my research, I also found that I better
understood courses I had already taken," she
said. ~
Panos Chrysanthis, a professor in the

"A lot of the
I instruments in the
chemistry ' depart-
ment are old," said
Paul Rasmussen, a
chemistry professor.
"As the instruments
get older, their value
decreases."

Morales, .39
years old and a non-
traditional student,
helped to ﬁnd ways
to make the instru-

ments used in chemistry labs more accurate,
faster and more convenient.

Morales said he wanted to overcome his
fear of computers yet somehow work in his
major. It was during the course of his work
that Morales said he learned the hue mean-
ing of research. A . .

"Oftentimes in research, things don't go
the way you want them to go or in the way
they are supposed to go. Ifthings go right, it's
like following steps that are listed in a book
But if things go wrong, that is where
research begins," said Morales. "It is when

"things go wrong that you ask yourself, 'Why

didn't this work?‘ Then you go and ﬁnd the
answer. That's research."

Morales’ tendency to philosophize on
the meaning of research stems ﬁcm his stint
as’, a philosophy major.

"The questions concerning science are
founded in philosophy," Morales said. "The
answers to those questions are what become
the different ﬁelds of science."

He added that his change in majors
came also out of necessity. ‘

"It's actually possible for a chemistry

major to actually ﬁnd a job after graduation," .

research, she thought she'd like to gain some
of her own research experience before going
to graduate school. —

For Mitchell, the most challenging part
of her research is that "nothing is certain."
Because of this, she tries to apply the things
that are somewhat certain to the areas that
are unknown.

Not only does uncertainty surround
quasars, but there's also uncertainty sur-
rounding physical reactions of particles.

Mike Mulheam, a senior majoring in
math and physics, was part of a team that
built a detector called a drift chamber that
would determine the reactions caused by
electron beams. Electron beams are small,
fast moving particles.

"Basically, these were frm, expensive
toys," said Mulheam.

Mulheam helped build the tools
involved in research.

"A lot of physics today is scattering
experiments," he said '

Mulheam and his colleagues wanted to
know what happened to these electron
beams at certain locations.

"It's like you want to study what the land
of an island is like.‘ But the problem is that
you can't reach the island So, you shoot off
a canon that will hit the island, and from the
debris that arises you are able to study what
the island is made up of," Mulheam said. "It
is a destructive way of learning."

Before coming to Pitt, Mulheam knew
he wanted to do research but admits to not
realizing the importance of undergraduate
research until he got started.

"You learn differently doing it on your
own. There's no one plotting a curriculum.
The hardest part is probably convincing
yourself and others of the progress you've
made," he said "It's only now that I'm real-
izing the results of my work in building the
detector."

. Everyone in the natural sciences
believes that doing research is important
The students also suggest the importance of
it should not be lost on undergraduates.

"If you're a science major, you should
just start poking around [whatever depart-

ment] and ﬁnd a professor who wants help," .

said Mulheam.

Improving Pitt's
reien iicn  

We have a new committee working under the
provost studying different angles on improving
undergraduate retention.

Here are a few ideas:

- Opponents of closing or narrowing Bigelow have
always countered the argument for giving students
something resembling a rural campus by saying that
we chose to come to an urban university and should
be happy with that setting.

So, let’s treat Pitt like an urban campus. Urban
means part of the city. The only reason a student
might want to come to an urban campus is if he would
get to see the city. Pitt ought to help students do just
that. .

How? -

A Zone 1 bus pass built into our Pitt IDs would be
nice.

Without means for students to get around, Pitt
might as well be situated in the middle of nowhere, as
far as they’re concerned. The couple of fast-food
stops on Forbes hardly make the immediate vicinity
worthy of the term “urban.”

And speaking of food 

- Pitt requires resident students to buy meal plans,
but there is still little variety, and worst of all, very
limited hours for the places that do accept meal
blocks and dining dollars. .

Schenley Cafe should stay open until midnight, at
the least. And there’s no reason to close the new cafe
in the -Cathedral at 6 p.m. Students still have class in
that building until 8 p.m. and sometimes later. We
ﬁnally got a slightly expanded menu, and it disap-
pears before half of us are ready to eat dinner.

And something should be open all night so that

students don’t have to wander across Forbes in the ,

darkest of night past angry drunken panhandlers and
strange characters with lots of metal sticking out of
their faces just to get a burger.

- Hold more activities around campus and publicize V

them extremely well.
Many freshmen seem to never go any further west
on Fifth and Forbes than the Towers where they live,
nor any further east than the front of the Cathedral.
Why? They have no reason to go, and since the
ﬁrst things past those buildings are a bank and, well,
nothing, there’s not much incentive. For an urban
campus, Pitt can seem like an awfully small world to
new people.

Sunday, I was enjoying a game
of poker with a few colleagues in
the World Government Conspiracy
Club (or “Bad Guys ‘R’ Us,” as that
fun sign Al Gore made says). After
an afternoon of losing constantly, I
was ﬁnally poised to win back some
of the immense pile of stuﬁ my
friend Mike Eisner had won. (I’d say
he won it fair and square, but you
can never be sine with these guys.)
Withafullhouseinmyhandanda
stoic expression on my face, I wait-

“I’m out,” said the chainnan,
his inscrutable mouse-potato expres-
sion changing but little. -

“OK, Eisner, whatcha got?” I
sneeied

“I’ll see your food irradiation
plant,” he replied menacingly, “And
I’ll raise you the secret labor camp
housed in Cinderella’s casﬂe.”

This was war. ‘The UN. tanks
I keep in the woods behind Gordon
Liddy’s house. And all the black
helicopters under my command”

A gasp went up arormd the
table. Eisner lit up a fat Cuban cigar
and slapped his cards down. “I’m
out Dammit, Barnett!”

I scooped up ‘the chips and
ﬂashed — what else? — an evil
grin. “Mike old buddy, you still have

‘Ellen’ and the rest of the evil homo-
sexual conversion conspiracy.”

He grinned back. ‘True. But I’ll
miss thatlaborcarnp. It’s agreatten-

“Another round? I’ll give you a

I was feeling magnanimous,

and hell, what was I going to do with ‘

3,000 enslaved militiamen? I began

to shuﬁle the cards.

Just then the door opened

“Stephanopoulos!” a grizzled
voice cried. (Holfa’s got to lay off
the cigars.) “What’s up, young
man?” ’

His mane of thick, black hair
emerged from underneath a ball cap.
“Same old, same old I just got back
from the Society of Evil Liberal
Rhodes Scholars. We’re having a
hell of a time trying to complete the
labeling of back roads to facilitate
the seizure of ﬁrearms when the
Communist revolution comes.”

“I thought that was something
to do with endangering the world

“No, no, no. You’re thinking of

the outlawing V of Freon.

“Yeah. He is the Truth

An uncomfortable silence

Vince brightened “Can I cause

The son of God: a socialist in shepherd '5 clothing?

James Maude
Columnist

Economics and religion go
together like a cactus and a soft der-
riere, but Jesus Christ had more in
common with Karl Marx and Noam
Chomsky than Milton Keynes and
Adam Smith when it came down to
basic economic principles.

To be able to tackle such an argu-
ment, one must put these ideas in con-
text. When talking about issues such
as redistribution of wealth and wel-
fare, Jesus related it to rewards in the
kingdom of God and eternal life.
Remove the religious dogma from the
equation, and Jesus’ teachings on eco-
nomics, stripped to their earthly con-
texts, sound more Socialist than
Capitalist, even though most of
America claims to be a Christian
nation. ‘

When talking about earthly
wealth, Jesus had an “each according
to his needs” attitude. He believed in
redistribution of wealth; giving to the
poor and the needy. Matthew, a tax
collector who had considerable
wealth, gave up his fortune by giving
back to those he exploited to follow
Jesus. Many others followed his prin-
ciple, giving up lucrative careers.

Jesus’ famous quote sums it up:

“I tell you the truth, it is hard for

a rich man to enter the kingdom of
Heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier
for a camel to go through the eye of a
needle than a rich man to enter the
kingdom of God ” (Matthew 19:23-24,

Jesus also criticized those who
seek social position and political
power by any means possible (people
like me), and those whose donations
to the ‘church were more a form of
showing off than true fiscal comrnit—

12:41-44) is the classic biblical exam-_

Welfare: the creation of some

bleeding heart liberal? No, Jesus
Christ’s I’m afraid. Roughly 20 years
after Jesus’ death, several early
Christian‘ churches, acting on his
instructions, set up a rudimentary
welfare system. Churchgoers would
put money in a collection, and
through the church, it would be dis-
tributed evenly amongst those who
needed it, on a regular basis. The dis-
abled, widows and the elderly, whose
names were on a list of deserving
recipients, were the beneﬁciaries. The
Church of Ephesus utilized this sys-
tem, which was also in use in Rome at
the time. Would the Southern Baptists
follow suit? I think not. - V

Minus the words “Lord

Che Guevarra. While it is not Jesus
speaking, it can be found
in James 5:1, 3-5. In
fact, Jesus and his disci-
ples lived a

A flat tax — the Republicans can’tbe lhafstupid, can they?

Michael Berquist
Columnist

Well, it’s that time of the year again.
With politicians looking toward their re-
election campaigns this fall, it’s time for
them to ﬁnd an issue which resonates with
the public and exploit it for all it’s worth.
That issue this year seems to be the tax
code, which Republican members of
Congress have decided to declare war on
this year. The current system, they argue, is
too big and complex and riddled with all
sorts of unnecessary loopholes that favor
the rich. The solution? The ﬂat tax.

What is the ﬂat tax? Simply put, it is
the idea that a single tax -rate will be

‘ assessed on the incomes of all Americans.

Once a ﬁxation only of radical conserva-
tives (even the Reagan administration dis-
missed the tax because it was- too biased
toward the wealthy), it has gained credibil-
ity in recent years to the point where it has
pretty much become ofﬁcial Republican
Party dogma.

House Majority. Leader Dick Armey‘

has pushed hard for the Republican Party
to adopt the tax, and it appears that he may
get his wish. Republican leaders plan to
make the ﬂat tax the centerpiece of their

1998 and 2000 platforms, and wealthy '

advocates of a national sales tax (an even

more radical idea pushed by many conser-

vatives) and the ﬂat tax plan to spend as
much as $100 million dollars this year lob-
bying for a radical overhaul of the tax code.

So if these guys love the ﬂat tax so
much, then why is there such vehement
opposition to this tax from Democrats and
even a few Republicans?

In 1983, two ﬂat tax advocates named
Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka published
,a book called “Low Tax, Simple Tax, Flat
Tax.” This book has since become‘ the
unofficial bible of ﬂat tax advocates.
Though Republicans have attempted to
pitch the ﬂat tax in their speeches as a
tremendous boon to the middle class, Hall
and Rabushka had a much different inter-
pretation of the ﬂat tax’s effect on the tax
code. '

“The ﬂat tax,” they declared in their
book, “will be a tremendous boon to the
economic elite.” They went on to state that
“it is an obvious mathematical law that

"lower taxes on the successful will have to

be made up by higher taxes on average
people.” This is, to say the least, rhetoric I
doubt you will be hearing this fall from ﬂat
tax proponents. ,
So, ifthe ﬂat tax is seen by its advo-
cates as such a big break for the wealthy,
then why are ﬂat tax proponents using such
aggressive class warfare rhetoric and try-

. ingto pitch the ideaas aneo-Marxistredis  

tribution of wealth? . »
Polls. show thatmost Americans favor
a tax system that simpliﬁes the Byzantine
language of the tax code, but still makes
sure that the aﬂiluent pay more of their
income in taxes than they do. The ﬂat tax
advocates, who believe that America’s cur-
rent economic ailments exist because the
wealthy are taxed too much, do not want to
simplify the tax code but to enact a ﬂat tax
rate. In effect, they have decided to pitch
the ﬂat tax as the exact opposite of what it
really is. By. the time American people
would realize they have been had, they ﬁg-

I ure, it would be too late.

While the ﬂat tax would certainly
make the tax code (somewhat), less com-
plicated, it would certainly not decrease or
eliminate the inﬂuence of special interest
groups. “A ﬂat tax will not end lobbying
activity,” one critic noted. “It will just start

the game over at a new starting -point.” In’

fact, many special interest groups are
aggressively lobbying for the tax because
of the windfall they are likely to reap as a
result. ,
Also, it is worthnoting that the ﬂat tax
would actually increase taxes. on the mid-
dle class rather than reduce them, as advo-
cates have claimed. The Tax Foundation, a
conservative group that has provided

research for Armey, conducted a study
recently and found a ﬂat tax would raise
taxes on all those earning less than
$200,000 a year. Also, since businesses
would see their taxes increase under a ﬂat
tax and would likely move to counteract
that effect by lowering the wages they pay
their.err1ployees (or simply laying them
oﬁ‘) and increasing prices on their products,
most experts agree that there would be, in
elfect, a hidden tax on middle Americans
thanks to a ﬂat tax. ‘

That the current system  a disaster is

beyond debate. However, if anyone must
shoulder some of the blame for the tax
code’s complexity, it is the ﬂat tax advo-
cates themselves. ‘

Personally, I ﬁnd it curious that the
Republicans are so excitedly talking about
overhauling the tax code so soon after
adding ‘over 800 new items to that very
same code in 1997. Instead of adopting a
system that is, if anything, more ﬂawed
then the one we have now, we ought to
concentrate on preserving the progressive

nature of the ‘tax code and stripping away '

special interest deductions. Then, and only
then, can we have a system that is truly fair
and equitable.

Michael J. Berquist thinks the flat tax is a
scam.

 

  A II nds a
string of
  Super Bores

Watching the last 13 Super
3owls, it’s been easy to feel slight-
y ill hours after the greatest show
an American television.

All the pomp and circumstance
reading up to the game, all the $2
inillion commercials, and all the
grandiose halftime entertainment
:ouldn’t make up for the actual
games, which have looked more
ike horror shows than champi-
inships.

Maybe it was the chili dip.
vlaybe it was the buffalo wings, or
-naybe it was the hot sausage.

But for whatever reason, for the
ast 13 years, nauseousness has
eigned supreme after the Super
frame.

That all changed on Sunday,

‘Jvhen the AFC finally conquered
he NFC and exorcised the demons
«hat have haunted it since Super
Bowl XVIII.
‘ But more importantly than the
AFC winning the game was the fact
hat it actually was a game. It was-
:r’t a blowout; it wasn’t a laugher. It
:.vas a real game, with excitement
"rom start "to finish, as Denver
finally prevailed 31-24 over Green
3ay.

It’s only fitting that the Super
'3owl is a good game. After all, men
ind women across the nation have
fvaited 22 weeks for the penulti-
.nate game, the contest that will
‘mce and for all decide the best
3am in the nation. ‘

In that time, people have
Ssglected classes, ignored their
V-oouses and forgotten all other
‘-cmblances of a normal life.

 Only to have a not so good feel-

’ rig after the Big Game.

Maybe it was the chili dip,
-naybe it was the hot sausage.

But whatever the reason, the

Bowl XXIV and the Cowboys’ 52-
3.7 dismantling of the Bills in Super

Pitt gymnasts beat own beam record

Sophore |.isa Fhofer shows her balnce beam fomr. H

Christine M. Coates

 

For The Pitt News

Records are set, and
are then meant to be bro-
ken. _

That is exactly what
happened at the ﬁeld house
this past Saturday evening.

And before anyone
thinks about Vonteego
Cummings or Kellii
Taylor, it didn’t involve
basketball.

The Pitt balance beam
record was blown away by
a half a point in the gym-
nastics team’s big victories
over Missouri and Ursinus.
The new Pitt record is
48.725. This accomplish-
ment came along with the
team’s first and second
wins of the season.

“I didn’t realize we
broke the school record
until I got home,” said
Head Coach Debbie
Yohman. She said she

_ knew the team had some

great routines, but did not
know to what extent.
Leading the team on
the balance beam were
first-place finisher
Danielle “Freddie” Alba

and runner-up Pamela
Lieberman. The two
sophomores have placed
themselves in Pitt history.
Alba now holds the second
highest score on the beam
with a 9.85. Lieberman
falls right behind her with
the third highest "score a
9.825.

“[When]‘ one person
does well, it carries over to

the next person and then

the judges get into it,” said
gymnast and balance beam
competitor Lisa Fronhofer.
She also contributed to
demolishing the record.
The team did well all
around. On the ﬂoor exer-
cises, Calli Bodnar took
the spotlight. She had a
great routine with a score
of 9.7, which was good

enough for first place.

Alba tied. Megan Smiley of
Missouri for second place
in the tumbling event
despite battling an elbow
injury.‘

Panthers demolish Villanova
in men's swimming matchup

Jay Yander

For The Pitt News

The schedule ‘ may. have read
Vrllanova, but the University of Pittsburgh
men’s swimming and diving team swam
against themselves on Saturday afternoon.

According to Head Coach Chuck
Knoles, the meet against Vllanova, a
team ranked in the middle of the confer-
ence, gave the Pitt swimmers a chance to
push each other during races, which was
evidenced by many ﬁrst— ‘and second-
place ﬁnishes by Pitt swimmers, racing
against teammates rather than Wildcats.

Oﬂicially, Pitt took on Vrllanova and
prevailed convincingly, 145 — 84, in a
Big East matchup at Trees Pool. The win
increased the Panthers’. overall record to
4-2 and 2-1 in Big EastConference.

“Our biggest competition was against 1

ourselves in most of the races,” Knoles
said. ‘This kind of meet showed me who
really wants to go to the Big East
Championships next month.”

Team captain Jon Haggerty came
through with some solid wins on Saturday
in the 200-yard butterﬂy and as a member
of the 200-yard medley relay team along

_ with Brian Elko, Devin Meece and Jeny

Koller. ’ .
Coach Knoles was most excited
about the pleasant surprises certain swim-

.mers provided, such as junior Noah

Caplan in the 50-yard freestyle, Elko in
the 200-yard backstroke, Adam
Kotkiewicz in the 200-yard individual
medley and Steve Siler in the 1000-yard
freestyle.

“Those four stood up, took a chal-
lenge, and raced really well,” Knoles said.

“It was better than how they have been
swimming before this meet.” Three of
Knoles’ four surprises took ﬁrst place in
their events, with Caplan taking a silver-
medal ﬁnish.

This coming weekend, Pitt will travel
to Boston to take on nationally ranked
Harvard in a non-conference showdown.

Knoles says the upcoming meet
against Harvard will serve as a training
tool for Pitt as the team prepares for the
Big East Championships, the NCAA
Qualiﬁers, and ultimately, the NCAA
Championships.

“Harvard is an overpowering swim-
ming program, ranked nationally at 15th,”
Knoles said. “We’re going to have to be
steel—town tough this weekend.”

The game plan for the Harvard meet,
according to Coach Knoles, is to take each
race one at a time and for his swimmers
not to become intimidated by such a qual-
ity swimming program.

Knoles said the Panthers should win
at least four races, but deﬁnitely can pull
off six ﬁrst-place ﬁnishes against Harvard.
Knoles added that the tough goals the
team has set in the past will prepare the
swimmers for future meets.

“All we have to do this weekend is
win all the races we’re supposed to and
we’ll be ﬁne,” Knoles said. “It’ll be good
experience for us.”

The Harvard meet in Boston will take

place this Saturday, Jan. 31 at noon. The -

Panthers will then retum to Pittsburgh and
the friendly. conﬁnes of Trees Pool for two
meets in two days, when they play host to
Connecticut in a Big East duel on Friday,
Feb. 6 at 6 p.m., and to cross town rival
Duquesne on Saturday, Feb. 7 at noon.

GYMNASTICS

from recent injuries, had to sit out of
the action. ”

So the team changed strategies.

“Bars are our target area this
wee ” said Yohman.

Despite the targeting, this was the
team’s area of difficulty at this past,
weekend’s meet. Although the team
took ﬁrst and third place, Pitt failed to
win this event. Colleen Crisi had a
near-perfect routine in the loss, receiv-
ing a first place finish and a score of
9.775. ‘

But,.riding the strength of the beam

— perfonnance, the Panthers still had

enough to earn an overall meet victory.

“This was a great win because
Missouri beat ‘us last year,” said
Fronhofer. “We all knew we had the
ability.” .

Fronhofer’s coach concurred.

“We watered down our line up and

mom PAGE 7

still came up on top,” said Yohman. "1
This was quite an accomplishment for 5
the team since it has had so many 
injuries lately, according to the coach.  ’
Pitt’s overall team score for the 3
.meet was 190.1 (lOth.highest in school

history), besting Missouri’s 188.1 and

Ursinus’ 169.625. Pitt won three out of '
four events, losing only on the bars 3.

rotation. J’

This weekend the team will traveiii.

to James Madison University, where
the Panthers will have a tri-meet with
Rutgers and JMU.

“We will be expected to win,” said
Yohman, although the Panthers lost a
close meet to Rutgers last season.

The meet is set to begin at JMU at
1:00 p.m. instead of the 7:00 p.m. list-
ed on the gymnastics schedule. Pitt
returns home for a rematch - versus
Rutgers on Valentine’s Day, Feb. 14.

under Jim Brown. However,
after a 1-5 record and a team
revolt in mid-November,
Chouinard inherited 24 young
men who were fully involved in
the decision to make him their
leader.

“When we decided to make
Wade our new coach, things

Sullivan. “Something had to be

and as a coach, he really makes
you believe.”

Assisted by Wally Schiede, a
former Pitt hockey player,
Chouinard brings to the hockey
team not only his depth of expe-
rience but also philosophies the
ingrained in him from his play-
ing days in hockey-crazy
Canada.

which includes an emphasis on
the season’s positives. From an
outsider’s point of view, there

may be few positives, but from‘

Chouinard’s point of view he has
seen a world of difference. '
“I started in December, and
since then we have had quite a
few meetings where we’ve
walked out of the rink with a
loss,” Chouinard said. “Instead
of looking at each game as a
loss, we’re trying to look at the
positive aspects of each game,
not the fact that we are walking
out of each rink losing. I have
enjoyed the turnover of seeing
the positive aspect, rather than
dwelling on the negative.” '

includes tightening up on a spot-
ty defensive game, which before
the Christmas break yielded an
average of over 10 goals a game.
But it’s not just statistics that
show the Panthers’ improve-

dedication to the hockey team
and to the game.

Working with a college pro-
gram in the midst of rebuilding,
Chouinard has laid the founda-
tion of a never—say-die attitude,
an emphasis on team chemistry
and an ethic of hard work -— cru-
cial for a team that has nowhere
to go but north.

“We never quit, which is
really tough for the returning
players, who have played on
winning teams,.” explained
Chouinard. “They have returned
to a team that is not winning.
The newer players have played
at a higher competition, so this
level isn’t as tough, but it’s up to
the older players to step up and
lead, instill that never-quit atti-
tude.”

Sullivan and the rest of his
teammates have reaped the bene-
fits of Chouinard’s hockey
philosophies during his short
coaching reign, especially one
that applies to every member of
the team. -

“His philosophy is that
hockey is a team sport and he
helps each player individually,
which in turn helps the team as a
whole,” Sullivan said.

And that’s a worldly lesson

many other recent games, Super
Bowl XXXII was expected to reach its crescen-
do just after Jewel chimed out the final note of
the “Star Spangled Banner.”

The groans started early when Green Bay
took the opening kickoff and marched over
Denver’s defense for a touchdown on its open-

Denver staked its lead largely with th
of strong rushing from Terrell Davis (who
with 157 yards and the Super
Bowl MVP), clutch passing from John Elway
and key stops from an underrated secondary.

Green Bay, showing its desire to win its
fourth Super Bowl, came back to tie the game
24-24 early in the fourth quarter. But in the
end, the Broncos were able to fend off last
year’s champions and show that an AFC can
win the big game.

‘More importantly though, they showed that
the Super Bowl can also be a super game.

For once, it wasn’t the chili dip and it was-
n’t the hot sausage that caused nauseousness.

It was the game that caused contentment.
