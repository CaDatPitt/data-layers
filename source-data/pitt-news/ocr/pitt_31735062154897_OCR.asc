College Upperclassmen
Asked to Pre-Register

Russell Dixon, assistant d
Arts, announced Thursday that

ean of the School of Liberal
it is vital that all juniors and

seniors in Liberal Arts pre-register for the fall tri—mester.
Since the schedule‘ of classes will not be made up until

pre—registration is completed, so\that classes can be scheduled

according to demand, the.student who is not pre-registered

may well be unable to schedule¢
required or desired courses.

The procedure the student.fol-
lows in pre-registering is to refer
to the list of major -advisors found
below, go to the office of the man
listed for his department, and
make an appointment with him.
The advisor will then aid the
student in selecting courses for
the fall trimester. He will also
ask- the student about his plans
for attending the second and third
terms.

The accumulated reports from
all advisors will then be pro-
cessed, and from these will be
made up the list of courses to
be_ offered and the times at
"which they will be scheduled.
The student’s schedule, also, will
be madeup by the departments
according to the class selections
he will have made.

Students who have not pre-
registere will, of course, not be
scheduled in a certain class, and
will have difficulty arranging a
schedule.

Students may pre-register any
time from April 27 until the last
day of classes.

The following is a list of the
Board of Major Advisors aﬁil-
iated with the School of Liberal
Arts:

Zoology, Dr. Peter Gray; Bac-
teriology, Dr. Roger Weinberg;
Botany, Dr. Richard Hartman;
Biophysics, Dr. Martin Hanig;
Chemistry, Dr. Tobias Dunkel-
berger; Classics, Dr. A. M. Young;

Begins Today;

SGA Sponsors

The blood typing program spon-
sored by the civic committee of
SGA in cooperation with the Cen-
tral Blood Bank of Pittsburgh be-
gins today. Typing centers will be

in operation in the Student Union

and in the Commons Room.

Students who avail themselves
of this opportunity to have their
blood typed will receive a card
with their blood type on it that
they may carry, so that if they are

- involved in an accident any nec-

essary transfusions can be given
them faster.

The second part of this pro-
gram, a purely volunteer one, in-
volves signing people up who wish
to volunteer for membership in
the blood donor program. This
program aids the Pittsburgh hos-
pitals, which’ collectively use ap-
proximately 25,000 pints of blood
a year. Students signing up for
membership as donors would be
called to give blood when the need
arises for their particular type.

It would be decidedly ‘advan-
tageous forthe Pittsburgh hos-
pitals to have a reservoir of
donors nearby. Also, the stu-
dent participating in this pro-
gram would be entitled to re-
ceive free transfusions
‘After each person is typed, he

will be asked whether he wishes
to register as a possible blood
donor. ‘

Any faculty members or admin-—

istration personnel who wish to
participate in either phase of the
program are invited to do so.

One of the basic needs of students at this University is

 

        
   
   
   
 
  
  
  
  
 
  
  
  
 
  
 
 
  
   
   
  
  
   
   
 
  
   
  
    
  
   
  
   
 
   
     
 
   
    
     
     
    
    
  
 
  
  
      

- i a quiet, comfortable place to study. This is not to be found

in the libraries, which at times are noisy, and always dimly
lighted, stuffy, and uncomfortable. -

This is pa-rticularlytrue» of the Liberal Arts Reserve
Room where the -hard-back chairs. are undesirable and
drafts are a peril to the health of the student.

I Now, it“ is quitepossible that provision will be made

for; better study facilities in the new library contemplated. ,

But this -will not help ‘the present student body. _
In addition -to the improved library facilities, study
rooms should be set aside in the very‘ near future; These
should remain open until late in the evening and on Satur-
days, Sundays, and perhaps even holidays. A "
The library’s»prompt response to student. criticism sug-
gesting. that the library stay open to a later hour has been

' appreciated. It is to be hoped that this can be_extended to

even later at night, i-fstudent demand dictates, in the future.

The Student Union has some rooms which are seldom
used as meeting places. A number of these could be con-
verted to study rooms -and they would -be occupied far more

‘ soften. V

A study room, as we visualize it, should be a pleasant

place, with light walls, colorful furniture, and, above all,’

peace and quiet.

Dormintory students complain that they cannot study
in their rooms because of the inconsiderate noise‘ of—other
students. Many commuter students have‘free hours when
they want a quiet place to study. And one ﬁnal group exists
for whom the "need is even more pressing,.the residents in
fraternity and sorority houses, whereinoise is almost. un-

' avoidable.

‘= If the only way that the rooms can be made absolutely

l- quiet is to soundproof them, this -should be done. These

study rooms would. not be areas for students to, congregate

and socialize. The student would be under a moral obliga-

tion to come to the area only for serious study.

MacLeish » on Campus

By David Breokstone

I suppose that editorial observations upon a
two-week old event can usually «be relegated to
the same category as ﬁsh which has been lying
‘around for the same length of time. On rare occa-
sions however; I believe it is '
permissable to reflect upon shop-
worn news, if that news has
some current signiﬁcance.

The visit. of Archibald Mac-
leish, poet, for ..our Honors Con-
vocation will have current sig-
niﬁcance for quite some time.
His sentiments, formal and in-
formal,. were marked by pro-
fundity and understanding sel-
,dom heard in this highly or-
ganized academy.

I am recalling some good things which Mr.
MacLeish had to say for the too-many who chose

_ not to ‘listen to him. I am afraid, while doing it,.

that the readers of these comments will be those
happy few who didhear him, and who, conse-
quently, will find these words repetitious. "

, Why so many “students” failed to attend the
Convocation is a knotty problem, worthy of ex-
tended discussion at another time. Suﬂiceth to con-

~jecture here that MacLeish is not a household

word, and, perhaps, we have lost sight of our
values to a more alarming degree than we dare

, admit.

Mooleish Explores Truth

Choosing “The University and the Lie,” as his
topic, MacLeish explored the importance of truth
in human life. Finding that truth is a fundamental
element of freedom, he related this fact .to the
contemporary world", where truth diminishes day
by day. _

He reﬂected upon the menace of Russia——mili-
tary, economic, intellectual, andwhile readily ad-
mitting thaf nuclear warfare could indeed ‘end the
world in a day, he contended that the intellectual

 

W like .

threat was by far the most dangerous. By destroy-
ing a respect for truth, Russian lords are destroy-
ing human dignity, slowly but effectively.

In order to illustrate his point, MacLeish went
into detail in reviewing the personal and profes-
sional tragedy of Boris Pasternak. As a terrifying
example of what the deliberate and vicious. lie can
do, Pasternak’s ordeal is a model of perfection.

Many of'the audience had been hearing much
of Pasternak and his book during the past months,
andat. the first mention of his name, with a kind
of defensive reﬂex, they ceased listening and began
looking at their watches.

This was unfortunate for. two reasons. First,
they failed to comprehend what MacLeish saw as
the consequence of the Pasternak episode and what
he felt about the implications for a university in
"a time when truth is obsolescent.

Tuck Shop Advised "

I Secondly, they blithely passed on the report to
the starving masses in the Tuck Shop, that “Mac-
Leish reviewed ‘Dr. .Zhivago,’ and .I needed that
.”_ “Dr. Zhivago” was incidental to the
point that the lie is becoming a widespread com-
monplace in our time, and that the university must
stand as the advocate of truth and the foe of false-
hood, no matter what the cost. '

MacLeish’s speech 'was remarkable for its elo-
quent, trenchant prose. He developed his ideas with
acute clarity, he chose his examples with remark-
able appropriateness. He had a great deal to say
and he'expressed it with consumate skill. It is a
credit to the University that they will publish the
address in the near future.

 In the afternoon, Archibald MacLeish, teacher,
spoke informally in the Union Lounge, to about
one hundred students and faculty members.

He appeared as aware of the impact of the
spoken word as he is of _the written word. He drove
to the heart of the matter swiftly and unerringly
on every question. His hour of comment went by
with uncommon speed. It was a memorable occasion.

Heinz Chapel Choir
Sings Sacred Music

I

Editor, the.Pitt News: , ’
In reply to your editorial in

The Pitt News of Monday, April ’

13, I would like to point out the_
purpose of the Heinz ’ Chapel
Choir. ’

The Choir is an organization
intended to provide music of a
religious nature for chapel serv-
ices, therefore, we sing only-sac-

red music. Our invitation to sing’

at the Convocation was extended
by the administration who is
aware of the type of music that
we perform.

If secular music is desired, the -

invitation should have been ex-
tended to either the Men’s Glee
Club or‘ the Women's Choral who
perform this. kind of music.

The timing of the program was
such that the anthem followed
the invocation- Therefore a relig-
ious song. is more appropriate
than for instance the “Happy
Wanderer” or “Hail to Pitt.”

My suggestion is that if a re-
ligious hymn is not suitable to
the staff of the Pitt News that

they seek to have another group .
invited or that they advise the ‘

Choir in theselecting of a more
‘appropriate song. . »

Harvard University
-Discussed, Defended

 

Editor, The Pitt News:

My misguided friend should
have remained at Harvard long
enough to_ acquire a better un-
derstanding of the “advanced"
theories about education which
he believes that this university
holds.

There’ is no one concerned
with Harvard who would expect
the average undergraduate ,upon
entering college “to think free-

ly and independently in experi-

mental physics . . . (or in any-
thing. else) to increase signiﬁc-
antly" the sum-' of. human knowl-
_._edge,.u_..._ .  ,, ..'.

' «On the; ot

 hand

 
  

  
 

V-there-_ are -~

surely" teachers at1Harvard who
would not expect the superior
Harvard undergraduate to work
at a new and individual problem
before graduating.

Hence to graduate from Harv-
ard with honors, in most though
not in -all departments, a thesis
is required. This‘ is ordinarily
done in one’s senior year, and is

acceptable if its author shows_

insight and a mind which, is
alert to the subject in question.

That those Harvard students

who do not undertake individual
investigation are treated by
teachers as campus “igonramuses
. . . no serious effort (being)
made to teach them,” is not true.

Teaching at Harvard, -in spite
of the/numerous-and often fa-
mous intellects Who do it, is

exceptional. At Harvard “there.
_ is poetry taught by perhaps the

ﬁnestplaywright of our day,”
explains the “frank comparison.”
The playright in question

could be " Archibald MacLeish,_

and I would urge those Pitt stu-
dents ’who recently heard Mr.
MacLeish, and who doubt the
quality of Harvard teaching, to
reconsider. ‘

' Furtliermore, re a C h ers at
Harvard are not untouchable as
the article I refer to intimates.
In truth, most of them are in-
terested in their. students and
are anxious _to discuss any of
their questions.

In addition, at Harvard, there
is an exceptional tutorial sys-
tem beginning in the student’s_
sophoinore year, which supple-
ments the 32 courses of the un-
dergraduate (16 full-year cours-

cs or 32 one—semester courses"

constitute a full year program,
though up to ~40 one-semester

‘courses’, 5 each semester, may

be taken without special permis-

" sion). -

Tutorial is within one’s field
of concentrationand provides an
unequaled opportunity for fac-
ulty-student inter-r e l a t i o n s,

. . ricula’r'*reading- in :’his"*‘ﬁeld,-- ' and 4", -
;encou1'ag-infg  to___ .th_in.k. alon —

     
   
 

  
    
 

new and perhaps independent
lines. ' _ '

-In conclusion I should urge
that no excuse for Pitt is nec-

' essary, for our university is also

striving to the frontiers ’ of
knowledge. Its methods, faculty,
student body, and most import-
ant of all its ideas are improv-
ing._ Soon it too will be "the
great cultural center that is the
other university.”

‘Mohammedan.’ Cites
News Vigilance

Editor, The Pitt News:

I completely concur with your \

opinion as experienced i-n your
editorial of Ap1‘il"’l3. The per-
formance of “Hail Glacldoning
Light” by the Heinz Chapel

‘Choir at the recent Honors Con-

vocation was entirely out of
place and disgusting.
‘ I am a Mohammedan. There is
no God but Allah‘. I can not see
why I must" be subject, at every
turn, to these inﬁdel attempts at
proselytizing. Down with Chris-
tianity and Judaism. Bravo for
your vigilance. .

Pitt NewsrAdvi.sed ’
To State Prirwiples

Editor, The Pitt News:  ..
Your -three short paragraphs

concerning the appropriateness
of the Choir’s part in the recent
Convocation implies that you are
misguided by a principle so
basic that it need not be stated.
Such words as ‘‘clearly,’’ “sure-
ly,” “absolutely,” point to such.
a principle.

. .It would, I’ think, be a great
help not only to those. of us
who are faced with the practical
problems involved in Convoca-
tions, but to the understanding

of our whole American demo-, "

cratlc creed,‘if you would form-

ulate such a principle _in a future ‘

Mellon ppointnient

Called Unnecessary
Editor, The Pitt News:

My letter concerns the ap-
pointment of one of the two

. Mellon professors, Dr. Haywood

Keniston. Dr. Keniston is with-
out question a brilliant scholar
of the modern languages. This
plus a long background of dis-
tinguished positions, 7 qualiﬁes
him as a Mellon professor.

Yet there are some pertinent
considerations which should have
been weighed before his appoint-
ment was made. Dr. Keniston is
now‘72 years old. He was al-
ready serving in advisory capa-
city» to the Romance language
before being named. In the for-
mer position Dr. Keniston was
receiving a fairly substantial
salary and certainly most appro-
priate quarters.

It has been widely recognized *

among the faculty thatbecause
of his advanced years he will
have at very limited number of
years to devote to the instruction
of undergraduates. Otherwise, he
will continue to function pri-
marily in an advisory capacity.
My contention then is that Dr.
Keniston’s services could have
continued to be made available
without necessitating his ap-
pointment as a Mellon Scholar.
If his salary was not thought
to have been commensurate with

his standing, it could have been-.

increased. In effect, the result
of his appointment has beenhis
being taken off the University
ledger, his stipend‘ being now
recompensed by the Mellon fund:

What I propose is to inform.

the faéulty and the Board of
Trustees that the student body

1,!

is aware of the major policy de-
cisions of» these respective bod-
ies, and in many instances their
motivations. ‘

I believe that the average stu-
dent, albeit he may. not be of a
profound intellectual nature, de-
sires that this university will be
able to compare in quality with
the ﬁnest of its kind.

In order to achieve that goal,
the Mellon Professorships will
have to be dispensed in the man-
ner beﬁtting a topnotch educa-
tional institution. More young
and vigorous scholars of th e
caliber of a Jacques Barzun, or

an Archibald MacLeish will have

to be nominated. -
, If the faculty will respond ac

cordingly when the eight forth-

coming nominations are made,
they will demonstrate that they
have kept faith with the under-
graduate and upheld their in-

tegrity. _
If, on the other hand, some of
a the less dynamic intellectual

members of our faculty choose
to either nominate men whose
services to the ‘University will
have, been lessened by declining
years, or whose intellectual abil-
ities may not be in accord with
the high standards of the Mellon
Professorships, the undergradu-
ate will justiﬁably feel he has
been betrayed. ,

On behalf of the present and
future undergraduate popula-

tions, 1’ ask that the faculty not’

consider its special interests an-
tecedent to the broad educational
aims of the University. “ -

I ask that they forego the in-

‘ tellectual upheaval that might

ensue if a‘ truly great scholar
were ‘to become a Mellon Pro-
fessor indeference to a higher

The other day as I was walking down the street picking up
tinfoil, (Marlboro,incidentally, has the best tinfoil, which is
not surprising when you consider that they have the best cig_:_:»\-
rettes, which is not surprising when you consider that they take
the best ﬁlters and put them together with the best tobnccus
and rush them to your tobacco counter, fresh and ﬁrm and

the second largest ball of tinfoil in our family. My brotzlicr
Elea.11o'r’s is bigger—-more than four miles in diameter-but-, of
course, he is taller than I). The other day, as Iwas saying, while
walking down the street picking up tinfoil, I passed a campus
and right beside it, a movie ’theat-re-which specialized in show-
ing foreign ﬁlms. Most campuses have foreign movie theatres
close by, because ‘foreign movies are full of culture, art, and
esoterica, and where is culture more rife, art more rampant,
and ésoterica more endemic‘ than on a campus?

Nowhere; tlmt-’s where.

   

/ I‘

I hope you have all been taking adx-‘ant-age of _vourlloc:d foreign

film theatre. Here you will find no simple-minded, l:loIl_vwond "

products, marked by treacly sentimentality and m:1c.hine-made
bravura’. Here you will find life itself—in all its grimness, its
poverty, its naked, raw passion!

.Have you, for instance, seen the recent .l*‘renc.h import, Le
Crayowa do A/Ion Orwlc (“The Kneecap”), a savage and uncom-
promising story of a man named Claude, whose consuming
ambition is to get a jobas a meter reader with the Paris-i w:nt.<-~r
depa.rt..ment'.-I’ But he is unable, alas, to afford the ﬂzi-slilight

one needs for this position: His wife, Bon—Bon, sells her hair.

to a wigmaker and-buys him a ﬂashlight. Then, alas, C‘Alnu:.l'e-
discovers that one also requires a leatherette bow tie. This ‘time
his two y(iung daughters, Caramel and Noixgutr, sell. their hair
to a wiginaker. So now Claude has his leaf-h<=rette bowxtie,
but. nbw, alas, his ﬂasliliglit battery is burned out and the
whole family, alas, is bald.

.Orhave you seen the latest Italian masterpiece, La Donxnaﬁ’
Mobile (I Ache All Over), a heart—sh-attering tale of a boy and
his dog? Malvolio, a. Venetian lad of nine, loves his little dog
with every fibre of his being. He has one great dream: to enter
the dog in the annual Venetian dog show. But this, alas, requires

an entrance fee, and Malvolio, alas, is pennilcss. However, he

saves and scrimps and steals and ﬁnally gets enough-together
to enter the dog in the show. The dog, alas, comes in twenty-
third. Malvolio sells him to a vivisectionist. -

Or have you seen thenew Japanese triumph, K ibzdzsi-Sun
(The Radish), a pulse-stirring historical. romance about Yamoto,
a poor. farmer, and his daughter Ethel who are accosted by it
warlord one morning on their way to market? The warlord cuts

Yamoto in half with his samurai sword and runs oil‘ with Ethel..-

Whcn Yamoto recovers, he seeks out Et-he.l"s ﬁance, Red
Buttons, and together they find the warlord and kill him. But,
alas, the_wa.rlord was also a sorcerer and he whimsically turned
Ethel into a whooping crane. Loyal Red But-tons takes Ethel
_home where he feeds her ﬁsh heads for twenty years and keeps
hoping she'll turn back into a woman. She never does. Alas.

_: Orange -Twice

For First Wins

Something will have to give

tomorrow when the Panther
baseball
‘teams meet. at New Wilming-
ton. Both the Jungle Cats and
Titans are on modest winning

I . streaks, and Skyscraper ’U. would

 

   
 

like nothing better than to reverse
last year's 6-4 defeat.

Coach Bobby Lewis’ Panthers
swept a twinbill from Syracuse
at Wildwood last Saturday, 12-2
and‘ 7-1,_ while Buzz Ridl’s Titans

— have yet to taste defeat in their

three games to date. ‘They have
downed Geneva, Duquesne, and
Alliance. The Panthers have one
loss.

. The mitters from New Wilming-

ton, who ﬁnished with an excel-. .

lent 14-1 record last season and
won the District 30 NAIA cham-
pionship, appear to have another
strong team this year. The Titans
are also strong contenders for the
West Penn Conference title.

. Team Leaders Back

Among Ridl’s returning letter-
men are Ben Brenner from Pitts-
bugrh_’s South Hills High School,
_Jack Pogue of Pitcairn, Wilkins-
burg’s Glenn Smith, and George
James from Beaver Falls.

Brenner set a school record by

, posting a 7-1 pitching mark last
season. The junior righthander,
who will probably oppose the
Panthers tomorrow, also twirled
25 scoreless innings’ including a
1-0 victory over Duquesne.
Pogue was the squad’s ‘leading
hitter with a .403 batting aver-
age. . S ‘
Co-captain Bill Hamilton tossed
a three—hitter in the seven—inning
opener Saturday while Bob Conti
struck out 11 in the second game

4 "in leading the Panthers to their

doubleheader triumph over Syra-
cuse._ , .
Mustion Wild ,
Syracuse‘ used three pitchers in
the first game, but let John Mus-
tion go the full nine innings in the
nightcap even though he walked
11 men. He passed ﬁve in the ﬁrst
inning when the Blue and Gold
tallied six of their seven runs.
Shortstop George Schoeppner
and Leftfielder Nick Kartsonas
hit home runs for the Jungle
Cats in the ﬁrst game. In .all'
Schoeppner had three hits and
drove in ﬁve runs. Other Pan-
thers who collected more than
one hit included Jerry Matu-
levic and Herman Joy. Matu-
levic and Kartsonas also had
two RBI’s each. ’ _ I
The Orangemen matched the
Panthers with ﬁve hits in the sec-
ond game but lacked the 11 walks
that the Jungle Cats picked up.

Pete Colangelo led the attack for I

Skyscraper U. with a double and
a stolen base..Larry Broman had
two hits for Syracuse. ..

Kelly and Barnwell clipped off
the mile course in 3:19.1 for an
easy win. Ron Rush continued
his winning ways in the mile"
with a time of 4:l9.8, but had to
be content with a second place
in the half-mile.

Ed Vamos grabbed a first in the
broad jump with _a leap of 22 feet,
8 iches, his best mark of the year.

In other ﬁeld events Lee Pfrog-

a second

ner leaped 11 feet, 6 inches to win ;
the pole vault, and Ed Sherlock 1

tied for first in the -high jump.

Due to a combination of the
Panthers meet on Friday ‘and
faulty baton passing,‘ the Cats
had to settlefor places other
than ﬁrsts in Saturday’s Relays.

The same mile relay team that
won at Miami on Friday ﬁnished
second to Michigan on Saturday
with a time of 3216.7, almost 2.5
seconds under Friday's time. Rush
was the only other winner who
placed in the top three. Rush ‘ﬁn-
ished third in the mile that found
30 runners competing.

“Considering the fact that some
of our men ran three times on

Friday, then. ran three times on ‘
Saturday, I feel we had a success- _

ful weekend,” Rees said. “This.

The ﬁrst Shirt Satellite is ﬁ-
nally a reality! Just yesterday,
during their lunch hour, Van
Heusen scientists launched a
Van Heusen Century Shirt
into the stratosphere. It’s now
circling the earth 180,000 miles
up, in,an orbit so large that a
grown man couldn’t walk it,
even in a whole day! Travel-
ing at the legal 35 miles per
hour, it is expected that the
Van Heusen Century Shirt
Satellite will remain up there
in the blue beyond for at least
1200 years. And, with luck,
, maybe 1201. ‘

“But,” you will ask, “what
value will the Shirt Satellite
have for science?” Just this,
friend! It will further prove
the immutable law that the
soft collar on Van Heusen
Century Shirts won’t wrinkle
. . . ever!-You see, the slick
Van Heusen physicists have
attached an electronic
Wrinkle-ricter to the collar of
the Van Heusen Century

 

Shirt. This clever device will
constantly send back elec-
tronic reports on the condition
of the collar, so, for 1200 years, ,
we earthlings will have abso-
lute proof that the soft collar
on Van Heusen Shirts won’t
wrinkle . . . ever. Should you
ever have any. doubts, just
drop in to the Van Heusen
oﬂice, and listen to the reports
coming back from the Shirt
Satellite. _
One more thing—the Van
'Heusen Century Shirt Satel-
lite will drop back to the earth
in the spring of 3157 (possibly
3158) and you're all invited to
the return party! If, in the
meantime, you want to see.
‘the Van Heusen Century
Shirt, you, can at your campus

in 15 collar styles, in white,
stripes and colors. $4 & $5.

You can reproduce the experiment.
It’s easy as 7|’ . (Yes, you can do it

A have ﬁrst visited your friendly tobac-
conist, simply light your ﬁrst Winston
and smoke it. Reasoning backwards,
the discovery" proceeds as follows:
ﬁrst, you will notice, a delightful
ﬂavor, in the class of fresh coffee or
of bread baking. Obviously, such

ﬂavor cannot‘ come from the ﬁlter.
Therefore, it’s what’s up front that
counts: Winston’s Filter-Blend. The
tobaccos are selected for ﬂavor and
mildness, then specially processed for
filter smoking. This extra step is the
real difference between Winston and
all other ﬁlter cigarettes. Besides,
it’s why Winston is America’s best-
* selling ﬁlter cigarette.

“Eureka! Winston tastes good . . . .

claim, will be conducted for
anyone who is interested in see-,
ing how he or she measures up

ties.

There will be many games
conducted, among them squash,
badminton, handball, volleyball.
In addition all_the other’gym-
inastie equipment will be availa-

~ble. The high jump, the tram-
poline, horse, ladder, parallel
bars, rings, will be open
