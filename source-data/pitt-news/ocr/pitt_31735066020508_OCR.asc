Pitt   cops

By Kathleen l... Kashay
The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh
Campus Poliee elected the Pitt
Police’ Association to be their bar-
gaining agent last Friday in a cam-
pus police union election. The PPA,
which carried 71 percent of the
votes, will represent the Campus

Police in contract negotiations with *

the University of ._Pittsburgh this fall.
Officer Leo Lydon, Treasurer. of
the PPA; said the union hopes to
have a package to present to Pitt's
Public Safety Department by Nov.
1, 1984. “Fringe benefits and wages
are to be considered in the negotia-
tions,” Lydon said. ‘
Campus Police officers currently
earn $8.75 an hour at top pay scale,
according to Officer Karen McKee,
PPA vice president. “Pitt is the low-
est, lower than the low. Almost any

full-time police force of our size does -

better. Even certain security outfits

.— U.S. Steel, McGraw-Edison —

are making $10 to $12 an hour,"
Lydon said about salaries. Officers

with the Pittsburgh City Police‘

Department are earning $11.94 an
houn. 1 ~

This fall will mark the first con-'
tract negotiations for the'Campus
Police in eight years. Their last con-
tract expired in 1979. McKee said,
“We worked without -a contract
since then because we were trying to
get reclassified from Pa. Act 195 t
Pa. Act 111." . ‘

Pennsylvania Act 111 stipulates
binding arbitration- in contract
negotiations. If union, and manage-
ment cannot come to agreement on
contract issues, an arbitrator‘ is
appointed by ‘the state. Both sides
must abide by the arbitrator’s
mandates. . '

Asked about theadvantages of
binding arbitration, Lydon said,

“For the most part it deals in wages ,

and fringe benefits. The arbitrator is
supposed to give the fairest deal for
both sides within the funds availa-
ble.” However, James Watters,
assistant director of . the Public

'Safety Department, said that in

July, “Pennsylvania Supreme Court
decided that. the employer [Pitt]‘
does ‘not come under Act 111
because it is a state-related institu-
Ltion. It has no taxing powers to gen-
erate revenue to pay awards which
could be granted by an arbitrator.”
Under Act 195 classification, the
Campus Police are “free to ask a
mediator to facilitate discussion, but
the mediator _has no decision-
making power. When there is dis-
agreement, negotiations can go on
forever,” according to McKee.

n CAS.

By Jill Colamarino
The Pitt News

Although the university’s Office
of Affirmative Action has “ongoing
proposals” to facilitate the needs of
"wheelchair students, thereare some
buildings on campus’, that are less
accessible than others. Some build-
ings are not accessible at all. _

The Cathedral of Learning, one of
the older buildings on campus, has
given wheelchair students problems.
Recent digging around the Cathe-
dral has only compounded those
problems. I i

Thomas Williams, a CAS student.
who uses a motorized wheelchair,
was unable to get to a class in the
Cathedral at the beginning of the
semester.

He approached the electronic
entrance for wheelchairs, located
across from Heinz Chapel, intend-
ing to get to his class, but he couldn’t

‘ get in. ‘He then went to a side door in
Lilly Court, but it was locked. There
was no other way for him to get in.

“I looked almost an hour for
someone to open the door, and I
missed my first class,” said Williams.

Tom Galante, coordinator of Dis-
abled Students Services, said the A
Cathedralof Learning’s accessibility
is “not good, even under the best
conditions.” He explained that there
is only one wheelchair entrance

because of the architectural’ design
of the building. Huge wind’ currents
would result if another door were
constructed. H

“We have recommended an access

door _on the Bigelow Boulevard side,
but it will require extensive renova-
tion,” Galante said.

“As far as elevators go, the
Cathedral of Learning is the worst,"
said Raymond Sestili, ta CAS stu-
dent who uses a manual wheelchair.
“We have to use the freight
elevator.”

. With the exceptioniof the second
floor, anyﬂoor of the Cathedral can
be reached. by the freight elevator. If

0 there is no one available to operate

the elevator, x5696 can be called for
assistance. If a wheelchair student
has registered for a class that meets
on the second floor, the class must
be moved. .

Galante also added that there is
little parking close to the Cathedral
and that those spaces are often occu-
pied by cars without handicapped
parking plates.

Sestili, who lives in Tower C, said
he finds Pitt's campus “pretty
accessible.”

Gerard Kowalski. assistant direc-
tor of the Office of Residence Life,
said Pitt has “a number of dorm-
rooms modified for wheelchairs.”

The eight rooms, four each on the
third and 12th floors of Tower C,
have wider doors with different door
handles, lower desks and tele-

Cathedrallaicks wheelchair access

phones, said Kowalski. “We do the
best we can to, facilitate [resident]
wheelchair students."

A major "problem, according to
Michael Bruner, assistant to the
director of affirmative action, is
identifying wheelchair students
early. Handicapped status, as well as
race and citizenship, is voluntary
information that need not be sup-
plied by Pitt applicants.

Once 0 students have identified
themselves as having a “motor or
physical impairment,” there are a
number of services available to
them. ,

The Office of Affirmative Action
will provide a wheelchair access map
onrequest. This map, researched,
written and edited by disabled CAS
undergraduates, isiessential so that
wheelchair students can plan the
easiest routes to, get to classes.

Disabled Students Services oper-
ates a van service to ensure that
wheelchair students have access to
campus events.

“Its better than the campus bus
because it doesn’t follow a pre-
scribed route,” Galant_e said. The
van service costs $23,000 per year to
operate, according to Galante, and
comes from the DSS budget. ,

The Music Building and Mining
Industries Building are completely
unaccessible to those-in wheelchairs

because of steps, either inside or out— w

side the building. T
With regards to present legisla-

misunderstood. “The law doesn't f
say that all buildings must be access-_ ,.
ible, it says that all programs mus __r
be accessible,” he said. . ;
DSS sees that all university events
are scheduled in accessible places. i
- lf a university-affiliated person-
has a grievance concerning his or her.’-‘
handicap and accessibility, "the ,,
Office of Affirmative Action can i

any‘ problems on a case-by-c_ase
basis and, if no solution can be j‘
worked out, one has the right to file 4
a formal grievance. — _
Grievances are infrequent, but in
“each one is important," said 7'.
Bruner, whose office works at the'"‘
policy level. ' ' ‘

Bruner offered some suggestionsg
to those not confined to wheelchairs
in order to “indirectly help” those
who are. His suggestions are: “Don’t’:
block wheelchair entrances, don’t.
block wheelchair ramps and don’t
park in handicapped spaces. That
could be devastating to a person inai '
wheelchair." 0 i’ _

Galante said that some solutions
to the accessibility problem have to": ;
be done by handicapped individuals
themselves. , 

“You have to make your needs"
known,” he said. “If not, you're part‘
of the problem, not the-vsolution.«”,j.i

World Food Day -

Panel dis

By Joel Bloom
The Pitt News

Yesterday, World Food day was
observed in the Student Union to
mark the 39th anniversary of the
United Nations’ Food and Agricul-
ture Organization.

Observances took place in over
150 countries; legislatures debated-
food policies; farmer co-ops held
discussions; and thousands of uni-
versities, including Pitt, held discus-
sions on the world food crisis.

Pitt observance consisted of a
panel discussion entitled “Women in
Agriculture.” Dr. Lauren Bossen
was first to address the Pitt
audience. Speaking primarily about
agricultural and food conditions in
Guatemala, she disputed the classic

FORMRL Y DANNY.’S PUB

 

theory that “not enough food is pro-
duced." “Some say the problem is in
distribution of the food,” she added.

Bossen also said that agriculture is
indeed increasing. However, this
isn't always in foodstuffs. Cotton,
which provides countries such as the
United States with cottonseed oil, an
ingredient in cookies and biscuits, is
a big crop, but people can’t eat
cotton.

Bossen also spoke on the horrible
working conditions for poor
workers who [must earn their living
by working on the plantations
owned by the rich elite class. “People
virtually have to work for the plan-
tation owners. The bosses are sup-
posed to provide food, etc., but this
is hardly enforceable,” she said.

Dr. Billie Jean lsbell, whose work
concentrates on Peru., added that,
“This food shortage is characteristic
of many Latin American countries. 1

cusses crisis

think“ we are bound to see a con-
tinuedincrease in population while
at the same time the food supply to
these nations will decrease.”

The panel then shifted to Dr. Joan
Amarteifio from ‘Sierra Leone in
Western Africa. She stressed that
the people in her country aren’t able
to handle heavy technology. She
said they just don't have the know-
how to properly upkeep the machin-
ery. As an example, her government
once received ten tractors, and now
none of them are in working condi-
tion, she said. “We have neither the
technology nor the spare parts to
keep them in repair. Just give us
basic tools.”

One startling revelation by Dr.
Amarteifio is that much of the aid
her country receives is taken by the
elite power structure and ends up in
Swiss banks, instead of going to the
people who need it for survival.

 P   

Dean opposes budget cuts

By Wendy Sharkey
The Pitt News

Dr. Jerome D. Rosenberg, dean
of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences,
voiced his concern over the provost’s
planning process — a comprehen-

sive investigation of the academic ‘

status of the entire university — dur-
ing yesterday's University Senate
Meeting.

Rosenberg, who said it is not pos-
sible to correctly anticipate every-
thing that will happen within the
next five years, fears that groups

who have been deemed weak or of

less importance will wear down.
This can be considered a direct result

of the 25 percent budget cuts across '

the board.

According to Rosenberg, univer-
sity deans are not overwhelmingly
enthusiastic about this investiga-
tion. They ‘consider it difficult for
the project to be honest and fair. In
addition, Rosenberg questioned ‘the
accuracy of projections raised by the
investigation about the future.

In past years, the College of Arts
and Sciences had anticipated an
upward movement in graduate
enrollment and a downward move-
ment in undergraduate enrollment.

This projection was proved wrong
this year as undergraduate enrol-
lment increased 7 percent and grad-
uate enrollment increased only 5
percent.

According. to Chancellor Wesley
Posvar, speculation is an important
factor in planning for the future.

“Forecasting is useful. We are
more than looking ahead now, we
are helping one another to shape our
own futures,” said Posvar.

Forecasting and speculation are
helpful because thev force faculty
and other individuals to look out-
ward at the realistic strengths of

their respective departments, Posvar ‘

explained.

Dr. Roger Benjamin, Senior Vice
Chancellor and Provost of the uni-
versity, “fundamentally rejects"

‘ Rosenberg’s fear of the disintegra-

tion of morale on the part of groups
deemed of a lesser priority.

“It is not a disaster if a program
needs to be reduced over a period of
years, if for academic reasons,” Ben-
jamin said. According to Benjamin,
Pitt is a complicated university and
has many responsibilities. The uni-
versity must be able to deﬁne institu-
tional priorities and be able to alter
the focus of those priorities in order
to respond to change.

“Our institutional priorities are.

faculty development, where teachers
would receive more research leaves
and sabbaticals and be able to
‘expand their academic horizons. In
addition, the need for technological
equipment, which is no longer a lux-
ury, must be financed,” Benjamin
said. “We must respond to these
kinds of needs.”

Those students are probably few
and far between who haven't heard
or read about the Governmental
Relations Committee’s recent cam-
paign to right the problem of the
buslane.

Chuck Pascal, executive director
of the GRC, directed a panel discus-
sion attended by SGB’s Avery

_ Abrams that sought to arrive at a

solution to the buslane problem.
The discussion waxed and waned as
panel members . strove to assert
themselves by way of pregnant
pauses and sarcastic stabs at fellow
panel members until in the end a
possible solution was apparent —‘—
the city agreed to look into the idea
of posting signs and affixing beepers
to buses. »

Last Monday, Abrams reported
to the GRC that “we got everything
we wanted” — signs displaying the

‘*rPort Authority’s symbolic diamond,



an

crosswalks and diamonds repainted

 

      

on the street and no right turns on
red for buses.
While these new and improved
.ifcty measures are sure [0 i: ; prett>_
they will cost some amount of
money and will, given certain facts,
undoubtedly prove worthless; buses

' have probably not been sneaking up

on students and catching them
unaware. Buses are very big. Buses
are also very loud. Ifa student fails
to see and hear a roaring mass of
glass and steel, it is reasonable to
assume he will not be shocked into
alertness by a completely silent sign
or figure in the street.

The thing to do is not to spend
funds to alter the buslane but to do
away with the bus lane altogether.
Take the parking away from Forbes
Avenue and transfer it to the former
bus lane on Fifth Avenue, thus free-

ing a lane on Forbes to which the
buses can be transferred. No parking

loss, no traffic congestion. Rather
than beingjostled from the crowded
Jdewalk out infront of a moving
brzs, one would just fall onto a
parked car. When one steps out into
the street without looking, he will be
between parked cars with a clear line
of sight. No more being splashed
when buses go by. This plan seems to
be sound on all fronts.

When suggested to the GRC.
however, this proposal was met with

great displeasure and shouts of, “It’s ,

not the . buses’ fault that students
don’t know how to cross the street!”
It does little good to pass the blame;
there is a practical problem to which
we must find practical and practica-
ble solutions. The present “solution”
will be a trophy on the mantle of its
proposers and is little more than a
scheme to absolve responsible per-
sons of guilt. This will not do, and I
urge the GRC to act accordingly.

Unsafe Elevators

As a resident of Tower C, -1 am
also _deeply I concerned about the
operation of elevators in our build-
ing. I feel that Ms. Grayson’s pres-
cription for the problem is extreme
and can only encourage more prob-
lems to surface. Let’s be realistic; if
we are dealing with individuals who
are willing to endanger their own
safety by damaging the elevators,
what makes you think turning. off
the elevators for a weekend is going
to encourage these individuals to
behave in a responsible manner?
They may even try to retaliate in
some bizarre fashion. .

In no way am I condoning the
actions of a few immature individu-
als; I do feel there is a better way and
the Office of Residence Life should

\

deeper before _ something more
severe happens. As a consumer, I
feel that I’m not receiving my
money’s worth by worrying about
elevators that may or may not reach
their destination safely.

Pitt should insure the safety ofits
resident students. It seems as though
the university is willing to wait until
something tragic happens before it
corrects the problem. I’m urging the
university to take action now before
it’s too late.

‘ Role of  e 7

.1 would like to clear up a few
points concerning the article in The
Pitt News on Friday, Oct. 12,
entitled, “Mondale Talking Rough,”
in which I believe a statement that I

. am said to have made could be

misconstrued.
My comment was not that Geral-

dine Ferraro’s “function as vice pres- _

idential candidate was to attack the
opponent‘s policies, ‘as opposed to
mutual criticism by the actual presi-
dential candidates’ ”. What I said
was that the role of vice presidential

candidates in general, rather than

Ferraro ‘specifically, is to be the
more aggressive campaigner while
the presidential candidates tend to
keep themselves “above" the fight-

ing. This would apply to the.

Reagan-Bush ticket as well as the
Mondale-Ferraroteam. _
Lwould liketo add that [believe

very

be looking into the problem’ a little

effective in raising the issue of unfair
economic policies of the Reagan
administration which place the
heaviest ﬁnancial burden on work-
ing families, low—income persons
and the disabled while reducing
taxes only for the rich.

Secondly, I would like to point
out that Mondale’s statements are
not necessarily “anti-Republican" so

,much as they are statements which

tell the truth about the Reagan
administration. If we review Rea-

gan's record over the past four years
we still find an accelerated nuclear
arms race, ravaged Social Security
and Medicare programs, a weaken-
ing of the civil rights laws, a poison-
ing of the environment and a $200
billion budget deﬁcit. Mondale
doesn't have to make Reagan look
bad — Reagan’s record speaks for
itself.

  Gay mar
still a rarity here  

I A

.«

By Lisa Papi
The Pitt News

There are more important issues
in the gay community than homo-
sexual marriage. Civil Rights, dis-
crimination in employment, social
affairs —— along with the debate over
health issues —— are the gay com-
munity’s primary concerns.

Still, the need for companionship

A and commitment is not reserved to
heterosexuals. "

A Pitt psychologist, who asked
not to be identified due to her sexual
preference, said, “Having a commit-
ment makes them [the gay or lesbian
couple] feel like a complete couple
— just like a married heterosexual
couple.”

According to a long-time support-
er of gay rights who wishes to remain
anonymous, “In my opinion, there is
a larger number of lesbian mar-
riages, although this does not mean
that only women feel the need to
make a long-term commitment,” she
said. “Perhaps gays who are pres-
ently involved in a long-term rela-
tionship and make no attempt at
marriage are quite content with their
present lifestyle.”

Homosexual marriage is not as
much of a major trend in Pittsburgh
as it is incities such as New York or
San Francisco due to the smaller size
of Pittsburgh's gay community.
There are homosexuals in this city,
however, who do wish to have a per-
manent commitment to one
another. They can be joined together
in a ceremony called a “holy union.”

9'26

 

 

Thefatholic and Jewish religions
oppose the idea of homosexuals
beingjoined together. They are both
willing to counsel homosexuals on a
vast range of problems, but they still
do not approve of the “marriages.
“We will not judge or persecute
them; after all, they are also God’s
children," Rev. Leo Vanyo, pastor
of St. Paul’s Cathedral, said.

Both the Catholic and Jewish
faiths are sympathetic to the prob-’
lems of homosexuals. Although the
Conservative Jewish religion con-
siders homosexual marriage a sin,
Catholicism says that a sin is “objec-
tive guilt” and homosexuals are not
guilty of anything. But Catholicism
states that overt homosexuality is
morally wrong because it is both
unnatural and unacceptable to God.

A “holy union” can be obtained in
Pittsburgh only through the Metro-
politan Community Church. First,
the couple must go through the
procedure for marriage: counseling,
special classes,
exchanged in the presence of wit-
nesses, family, and friends. After the
ceremony is performed, usually by a A
member of the church's clergy, the
couple is blessed.

It is important to note that these
unions are not legal marriages. They
are not recognized as marriagesby
any state in the U.S. because the
participants are of the same sex. But
they are not illegal.

According to a sociologist at the
Allegheny County Community Col-
lege who also wishes to remain a-
“The majority of
homosexuals really do not think
about it. This may or may not be
directly correlated to the fact that in

the last 10 years homosexuality has
become more open and more
visible."

Even though “holy unions” are

onthe street” 

not legal‘, they do have their share of .

legal complications: buying proper-
ties, co-signing loans for cars and
mortgages, formulating wills and
other legal documents regarding
money, etc.

What happens when a homosex-
ual couple decides to go separate
ways? It is done in a way similar to
that of a heterosexual couple obtain-
ing a divorce. First, the couple goes
back to the Metropolitan Commu-
nity Church to get their vows
dissolved.

According to a spokesman for
Sharon and Sharon, a Pittsburgh
law firm that handles many of these
cases, “As with any heterosexual
divorce, a homosexual union may
also need lawyers to handle certain
things when the couple decides to
split up. There may be property [real
estate], cars, bank accounts, wills,
insurance policies, etc., that the cou-
ple just can't work out on their own.
As with any divorce procedure, if
these matters can be resolved calmy
and rationally, there should be no
complications.

Many people, when approached
on the subject, tend to think that gay
relationships do not last. According
to Ms. Karon Von Gelder of the
Metropolitan Community‘ Church,
this is a misconception. “A gay rela-
tionship is the same as any other sort
of friendship or a serious love rela-
tionship. It depends on the
individuals.”

Pitt views

The Pitt News

What do Plato and Socrates have
in common? Not only were they
noted philosophers, but they were
also homosexuals. Since their time,
the debate over homosexuality has
progressed further to a new issue:
homosexual marriage.

In this week’s poll, 1 gave students
the opportunity to voice their opin-
ions on homosexual marriage. Stu-
dents were asked the following
questions:

0 Do you feel that homosexual
marriage is becoming a trend?

*0 Should it be permitted by
religion?

0 Should it be given the same legal
status as a normal marriage?

0 Do you feel that is acceptable in
the community? -

I What areyour feelings on the
matter?

The reaction to this subject was
mixed. “I think homosexual mar-
riage is fine unless they bother me,”
said one student. Another of those

Yes’
Is it a trend!» 53 ,
Should religion 2,

permit it?

Acceptable? 41

polled stated #1 just don't think that
it is right.” In fact, most of the stu-

dents polled said that it was no
acceptable. . -

On the other hand, most ,people
thought that homosexual marriage
is becoming a trend. “lthink that all I
of the recent publicity has helped it
to become a greater trend,” com-
mented one student. And 40 percent

-of all polled thought that homosex-

ual marriages should have the same
legal status as normal marriages.

But by far the largest opinion in
this poll was that homosexual mar-
riages should not be permitted by
religious institutions, held by 71 per-
cent of those polled. “It just doesn’t
seem to be the place of religion to
involve homosexual behavior,” said
one student. However, another
pointed out that “Religion is for all;
this means homosexuals,_ too."

Overall, the acceptance of homo-
sexual marriage in the campus is
varied. Many feel that it is all right as
long as it is confined to privacy. But
many others believe that the family
unit is sacred and that this issue
tampers with that tradition. The true
reaction, therefore, can n_ot be

_ declared to be positive or negative.

choose

bargaining agent  

continued from page one

In I979 some of the officers peti-
tioned the National Labor Relations
Board to decertify their then recog-

nized union, the United Plant Guard '

Workers of America. In its place
they wanted the Fraternal Order of
Police to act as their bargaining unit.

The FOP functions as a labor
union for Act 1 ll agencies only. As
a result of being denied Act 1 l l clas-
sification the Campus Police remain
ineligible to join the FOP labor

union. As state-certified police offi-
cers, the Campus Police belongs to
the FOP’s social organization.
“The Pitt Police Association was
"organized with a charter back in
1979 as a fund raiser for the FOP,”
said McKee. “Since we couldn't’ join
the FOP labor union we elected the
PPA to be our bargaining agent.”
Also on Friday’s ballot were the
incumbent ’UPGWA and a “no
representation” slot. The vote tally
was: PPA, 41; UPGWA 4; and “no
representation,” 12.

Ethics for Lunch:
Talk on Alzheimer

-By Rene’ Rolosky

The Pitt News it

“The loss of intellectual prowess

' [in victims of Alzheimer's disease]

may be more frightening to the pro-
fessional than loss of physical abil-
ity," according to Dr. David C.
Martin, Assistant Professor of Med-
icine and Psychiatry at Pitt’s Medi-
cal School.

I Yesterday, Martin addressed the

ethical problems concerning Alzhei- .

mer’s disease at a lunch-time lecture
series entitled “Ethics For Lunch"
held at Scaife Hall.

Alzheimer's is characterized by a
deterioration of mental or intellec-
tual capacity. Martin stated that a
major problem physicians face -is
distinguishing memoryloss due to
aging from a loss caused by the
dementias, or mind disabling dis-
eases. As the dementias progress,
treatment becomes even more diffi-
cult, he explained. “ltchanges, the

sometimes non-existent, Martin
noted that physicians sometimes
refer to treating these patients as
“veterinary medicine."

Ethical issues were also raised
concerning research on Alzheimer’s
patients. ‘Martin explained that all
research. must be done on patients
because the disease affects con-
sciousness and memory impairment,
making laboratory animal research
unadaptable. “Can society claim
minimal patient risk if the benefits
may be great?” he asked. With that
statement, Martin also introduced
other ‘questions such as whether
families can consent for the patient
and whether patients could consent
before the disease becomes too dis-
abling. Guidelines concerning when
a person can give “informed con-
sent” have not been established.

Dr. Martin also spoke of the
media's role in educating the public.
“Now people are more . educated
towards Alzheimer's but only by
extreme examples,” said Martin. He

‘ emphasized that the 'public_ needs’
-more education “about, the ,disease_

World affairs  
Speaker urges arms control

By Bryan Lee
The Pitt News

“It is never easy for U.S. officials
to come to grips with the Russian
Bear,” said Dr. Robert E. Hunter,
the director of European Studies at
Georgetown University Center for
Strategic Studies.

“The Soviet Union is an evil
empire,” commented Hunter, a
member of the National Security
Council during the Johnson Admin-
istration, at Monday’s World
Affairs Council Noon Briefing. “It is
an aggressive country —— expansion-
ist, overarmed — and [it] treats its
people like dirt.”

But, according to Hunter, the
Soviet Union shares with us the
responsibility to prevent “mankind’s
final war,” so unlike the Nazi
“cancer," we can’t go to war with the
U.S.S.R. in a “crusade to rid the
world" of a menace. “We must do
business with them in order to
manage."

Unfortunately, he said, in our
relations with the Soviet Union since

World War II we have not had a
consistent policy, “we go from one
extreme to the other."

During the Cold War, nothing
was possible, said Hunter, and then
we had Detente — and everything
was possible. Now it seems we have
flip-flopped again.

The Soviet Union is a brutal
regime and a gerontocracy, accord-
ing to Hunter; they are a “bunch of
old men playing musical chairs.

“They are brutal, but they aren't
stupid," said Hunter, adding that
they realize the consequences of war.
Millions died in the USSR during
World -War II, so they agree with us

-‘that in a nuclear war there would be

no winner. They agree with us that
we must reach some compromise.

What we must understand in try-
ing to establish constructive rela-
tions with the Soviet Union is that
they have “a gross inferiority com-
plex” in regard tothe U.S., no mat-
ter how well-armed they might be,
said Hunter.

There are tensions within the

Soviet Union as well,the most recent
of which was the rebellion in

Poland. Hunter predicted further
rebellion in Eastern Bloc countries.

In the midst of these declines, “the
Bear can be dangerous,” said
Hunter.

What can we do?

The first thing we must examine is
military strength, he said. He said
that our nuclear forces are sufficient
but we must do more for our con-
ventional forces.

The second is to have “strong and
healthy alliances,” according to
Hunter, especially in Europe.

“Disharmony between the U.S.
and her allies makes dealing with
the U.S.S.R. more difficult.”

Hunter called for better commun-
ications with the Soviets and a
return to arms control. Arms con-
trol needs political dialogue, said
Hunter, and through nuclear bal-
ance, stability can be reached. Hun-
ter did note an improvement: “At
least we’re talking about talking, not
talking about not talking.”

Hunter stressed that any arms
agreement reached must be ade-
quately verifiable.

“We have a difficult road ahead."

- A heated debate centering on

‘ recent arms control talks between

the U.S. and the Soviet Union was
held Monday night in Dining Room
B of the student union.

Dr. Thomas H. Etzold, assistant
director of the Multilateral Affairs
Arms Control and Disarmament

director of European Studies at
Georgetown University ' Center for
Strategic and International Studies,
squared off on the issues of the role
of arms control in U.S. security,
U.S. defense spending and the U.S.
weapons program.

Etzoldbegan defending the Rea-
gan administration's foreign policy.
He pointed out that the administra-
tion has several goals that it hopes to
accomplish with regard to arms con-

- trol. One of its main goals “is to

reduce the risk of nuclear war as well
as the use of any weapons of mass
destruction such as chemical and
biological warfare,” according to
Etzold. ﬂ __ __ _____> __ »_

Etzold cited the development of
the “Strategic Defense Initiative” as

‘V

an important project of the Reagan Q,

administration. He defined it as a
research effort that involves plan-

‘ning possible defense tactics in a

post-nuclear age when nuclear wea-
pons have become obsolete.

“We have to be concerned,” said
Etzold, “about nuclear prolifera-
tion, the balance of forces in Europe,
chemical and biological weapons,

‘ and how arms control fits into the

public agenda."
Hunter_then addressed the

audience. Hediscussed his feelings 9.5

on the nuclear arms policy of Demo-
cratic presidential candidate Walter
.Mondale. ' " ‘

Mondale, Hunter. said, would
place a much greater emphasis on
the achievement of stability. Mon-
dale opposes development of the B-1
bomber,“ the MX missile system and
the “Star Wars" program.

Hunter commented, “We must be
careful ofnot linking arms control
to other things [such as domestic
areas]. lfarms control is the interest
then we should pursue it.”

According to Hunter, Mondale
would pursue the Salt II treaty, so
the Soviets would have to dismantle
10 percent of their nuclear weapon-

Ex-agent opposes
., U.S. policy in Nicaragua

By Vincent Murphy
The Pitt News

What exactly is happening in
Nicaragua? With conflicting reports
coming-from the Reagan adminis-
tration and various eyewitness relief
volunteers, both the media and the
general public are confused by
events in this small Central Ameri-
can country, which some say indi-
cate that the first real full-scale U.S.
intervention since the Vietnam War
is occurring.

The basis of doubt on official CIA
reports from Nicaragua developed

when David MacMichael, a former .

intelligence agent assigned “to ana-
lyze CIA estimates of the situation in
Nicaragua,” decided to inform the
media of what he thought was the
truth concerning U.S.-supported
contra intervention in Nicaragua.

He announced in June of this year
that intelligence reports have been
skewed to justify the Reagan admin-
istration’s support of contra guer-
rilla forces being used to overthrow
the Sandinista regime. “This admin-
istration has determined as its pol-
icy,” he claimed, “that it wil-1 not live
with the current regime in
Nicaragua.” -

MacMichael spoke Monday
evening for “Witness for Peace,” a
national Christian organization
dedicated to speaking out against
U.S. policies in Nicaragua, and a
supporter of relief work on the war-
torn border of Nicaragua and Hon-
duras. MacMichael’s,accounts of
CIA coverups in Central America
were preceded by eyewitness
accounts_of contra activity given by
relief workers once stationed in
Nicaragua, and an address by
Tomas Tellez Ruiz, the executive

secretary of the Baptist Convention ' H

in Nicaragua. All speakers strongly
criticized the guerrilla tactics asso-
ciated with current U.S. activity in
Nicaragua.

The sinewy former CIA agent , ,

-opened his talk in a sarcastic, unex-
cited tone. He said that the Reagan
administration is attempting to jus-

tify contra activity in a nation where *

people are generally happy with the
current government. The adminis-
tration claims that major weapon
ﬂows to Honduras and El Salvador
exist on the Nicaraguan borders to
justify U.S. military activity, accord-
ing to MacMichael, who added,
“There is no such arms ﬂow.” This
excuse, MacMichael said, only takes
attention away from the actual
intention of the U.S., which is to
overthrow the Sandinista regime.

In what MacMichael feels is retal-
iation to controversy he created this
summer, on July 28 the Reagan
administration released a back’-
ground paper entitled “Nicaraguan
Military Build-up” to support its
position on the Central American
nation. MacMichael called it “shal-
low” and “a disgrace” as he held up a
copy of the report to the audience.

“If one of my college students
handed in a paper with such shallow
detail,” MacMichael said, “I would
suggest he give up his academic
career." '

MacMichael also mentioned a ‘i

press conference on Aug. 8 in which
defense officials and the current
U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua,
Harry Bergold,- supported contra
activity and attempted to prove the
existence of arms flow on the Hon-

duran border. A photograph of ‘

three weapons was presented as evi-
dence of arms exported from Nica-
ragua. MacMichael stated that from

T his personal experience with U.S._

three years. “You would think," he
said, “that with 10,000 contras
searching up and down for arms for
three years, they would have at least
blundered into something by now."

The horrors of everyday life due
to war in Nicaragua, according to
MacMichael, remain only as a result
of U.S.-backed contra activity on
the borders. Life under the current
regime “still remains extremely
open,” he said. Tomas Ruiz later
supported MacMichael’s claim that
life under the current regime is an
improvement over the former U.S.-
backed rightist regime. He said that
health care and living condition
have improved. »

All speakers at Monday night's
convention‘ of “Witness for Peace”
addressed what they considered
“horrors" being performed in the

interests of the Reagan administra- »

tion. Relief worker Liane Norman,
who visited Honduras and Nicara-
gua in August, asserted, “health care
workers and teachers are the most

frequent victims of terrorist attack
in Nicaragua."

Said Ruiz in a closing statement,
“Freedom fighters of President Rea-
gan have killed between five and
seven thousand people to date. They
burn the new schools and the new
health care centers  that is how the
money of American taxpayers is
being used in Nicaragua.”

. What lies in the future of U.S.
involvement in Nicaragua? “If the
United States continues on its pres-
ent course,” said MacMichael,
“there is a strong possibility of real
U.S. military intervention. It would
be very costly — five to seven thou-
sand dead at minimum."

In his closing-statement, MacMi-
chael pleaded with the audience to
help prevent a possible U.S. military

intervention in Nicaragua. “Tell,

your local senators to vote against
the continuation of funds for the
contra wars,” he said. “It is not the
U.S.’s task to have hegemonic
control."

Jenny Leach was one of several players to lose to a touch West '
Virginia squad yesterday, but she was not entirely dissatisfied.

Wednesday,‘October 17, I984 "

Racquet women crushed

By Bob Travers
The Pitt News

Sometimes" in sports, a team will
not have much expected of it. That
team is tagged an underdog and
plays with that label all season. The
Pitt women's tennis .squad is such a
team. About six weeks ago, when its
season began,the team was expected
to finish about even for the year or
with a few breaks, possibly have a
winning record. Yesterday, that
upstart team ended its season with a
loss to West Virginia an impressive,
if surprising, 9-4,season mark.

_ , “This team really improved as the

season wore on,” said head coach
George Dieffenbach. “They were
able to apply what we taught them in
practice. They really listened and
learned well. We really meshed as a
team. These ladies really proved
themselves and deservea lot of
credit.”

Yesterday, however, the Lady
Panthers went ﬂat, winning only one

match in singles play. Even with the
defeat, Dieffenbach found some-
thing positive to say. “ I think it’s"
very encouraging that we were able
to win one match and go to three sets
in two other matches. Last year, we

.didn't win a single match against

West Virginia, so this is very encou-
raging,” he explained.

It was Carrie de Vera who

, notched the lone Pitt victory 7-5,

6-4. “I was very confident. I got a
little cautious in the second set, but I
came back and won,” said the fresh-
man, who finished with a personal
record of 9-3. “It was the best match
I played all year; T ‘played a smart

match, too."

de Vera provided the only bright

spot for the Lady Panthers; Jodi 6

Levine lost her second match all year

in the No.l match,'and Rhonda.

Gibbs suffered a rare defeat in the
number two match. “I double-
faulted in every game. I didn’t have
the confidence in my serve that 1 had
at the beginning of the year,” said
Gibbs, who lost 3-6, 6-4, 4.6,

One lady Panther who lost yester-
day but still had reason to be satis-
fied with her effort was Jenny Leach,
"1 dl’dn't play that. bad today. I
wasnt great, but it is one of those
losses where you don't feel as lousy
about it," she said after her 1-6, 3-6
defeat. “It's tough. because you go
out there and give it l 10 percent but
still lose.”

Reﬂecting on one of his winning-
est teams at Pitt, Dieffenbach had
nothlllg hut praise for his young
club. This team has ‘a lot of charac-
ter. We showed that in coming back

in a lot of matches and in the
improvement
year."

Wiener ﬁnishes ﬁrst again

By Rich McKenzie
The Pitt News A

Last Saturday, when the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh cross country
team defeated a previously unde-I
feated Slippery Rock-squad 17-40,
freshman Bob Wiener not only was
the first runner to cross the finish
line, he also set a new course record.
This also marked the second consec-
utive week that Wiener was the first
Panther to cross the finish line. He
also did it against West Virginia in

the first meet of the season, which .

was his first collegiate meet.

Wiener is a second-term freshman
from Mt. Lebanon, where he gradu-
ated in 1983. At Mt. Lebanon he was
the consummate athlete. He

i received letters in soccer, basketball,

track and field,and cross country,
where he was the captain of the
team. When asked of the biggest dif-
ference between running in high
school and in college, he said, “most
of your main competition comes
from your own teammates who push
you in meets and in practice.”

Upon graduation, Wiener said, “I
was unsure of which direction I
wished to pursue, so I attended Wor-
chester Academy Prep School for a
semester.” There he chose to pursue

running because, he explained, “it

could provide me with the best
opportunity for a quality educa-
tion.” After talking with Coach
John Vasvary, Wiener chose Pitt
over William and Mary, Florida and
Southern Methodist for track and
.over smaller schools such as Ball
State forbasketball. Weiner said, “It
was close to home, and offered the

At Pitt, Wiener is what many feel
a student athlete should be. His
athletic scholarship pays “only

_somewhere between one-fourth to

one-half of entire tuition,” accord-
ing to Wiener, so it is obvious that he
is not on.a free ride. He is a pre-law,

Schenley Park at 3 p.m. for the after-
noon practice consisting of 8 to 12
miles. Wiener says his work-out
schedule leaves him with time but
little energy for studying. “Most of
the time I study, but sometimes after
going to class and practice I, feel
ragged out and I don’t feel like
studying.”

According to coach Vasvary,
Wiener has become “the leader of
the team in and out of practice.”
This, coupled with the fact that he
was the captain of the cross country
team in high school, would seem to
show a leadership quality. Wiener
commented, “Around my team-
mates both in high school and now
in college it’s easy to be relaxed.”

Coach Vasvary said, “Coming in,

also stated, “His biggest asset is his

beginning to learn how to use." Vas-
vary describes him as a “tough,

No grief in Miami for Kosar

By Mark A. Sindler .

The Pitt News

The college football ‘recruiting
wars. It used to be in most cases you
win some, you lose some. Nowa-
days, there's an asterisk next to the
phraseology: the “ones-you-regret-
got-away some.” When the coaching
staff passed over Bernie Kosargin
recruiting, little did it realize how
commanding he would become later
on. But around the time Pitt
engaged Georgia in the Sugar Bowl
on Jan. 1, 1982, the staff checked off
the reject box next to his name.

After a redshirt year in 1982, the
University of Miami quarterback
proceeded to lead the come-from-
nowhere Hurricanes to an ll-I
record and an astonishing Orange
Bowl upset of top-ranked Nebraska
and the national championship. By
and large, it is the team that I-5
Panthers will face Saturday after-
noon at 12:20. A 6-2 Miami team.

“I wasn't recruited by Pitt," Kosar

~ confirmed yesterday. “I had hoped
Pitt would recruit me. It's only an
hour from home, and they had an
offensejust like Miami’s. It's a little
late to come back now. I like it where
I'm at right now.”

No wonder. After passing for
2,222 yards and ‘I9 touchdowns his

senior year at Ohio's Boardman
High School, Kosar took a redshirt
before completing 61.4 percent of
his passes last season. His I5 touch-
down passes stood in good stead
next to those 2,329 passing yards.
Did Pitt goof‘? Ask head coach
Foge Fazio, and he’ll admit that at
the time, the staff’s evaluation was
probably correct.

“The opinion of the staff was that

he couldn’t throw the ball well
enough for us to recruit him," said
Fazio, who was then the defensive
coordinator under coach Jackie
~ Sherrill.
But it wasn't just the films and
visits by the staff that kept Kosar

Auethe

good

By Jim Brueckner
The Pitt News

Saturday's game against South
Carolina made me think of a line
from the Merle Haggard song “Are
the Good Times Really Over for
Good?" The line went, “Are we roll-
ing downhill like a snowball that's
headed for hell?”

One look into that dark world of
statistics is enough to scare anyone.
The Panther rushing attack was
back to its old tricks against the
Gamecocks, as they gained 108
yards on 45 carries.- The resulting
2.4-yard average still doesn't tell the
whole story. Charles Gladman
rushed for 55; yards on 15 carries (a
3.7-yard average). Craig Heyward
“led" the attack with 58 yeards on l4
carries for a 4.1-yard average. The
main problem remains that the rest
of the runners were only able to
“gain” minus five yards on 16 car-
ries. That is made even worse by the
fact that if you subtract a 9-yard gain
by Marlon Mclntyre on his lone
carry of the day, you are left with a
total of minus 14 yards on 15 carries.

On first-down plays, the Panthers
averaged 3.3 yards on running plays
and 4.7 yards on passing plays. With
such a low output on first down it
becomes rather difficult to convert
third-down situations. As a result,
the Pitt offense managed to convert

only five of 16 opportunities. They
converted only one of four in that
dreaded fourth quarter in which
they had been outscored 59-3 com-
ing into the game. Once again they
were outscored in the fourth quar-
ter, I7-7. That Panther touchdown

They'll be ﬁred up for us. We're

came on the first play of the final
quarter. ,

With this kind of a performance,
it might be hard to imagine how the
Panthers could lose the time of pos-
session battle by only 1:46. That's
because when South Carolina did
score, they did it with big plays.

said, “South Carolina is on a roll

There were some big plays hap-
pening with the Panther defense on
the field. It's too bad that they had to
come from the South Carolina
offense. After a slow first quarter,
they came up with a number of big
plays in the next three. The Game-
cocks had runs of 18, 20, 23, 43 and
48. They scored. on passes of 23, 31
and 33 yards.

Assistant coach Sal Sunseri
warned, “South Carolina is a fine
football team. They're undefeated
with a 4-0 record. Offensively, they
have two great, actually four great
running backs in Raynard Brown,
Quinton Lewis, Kent Hagood and
Thomas Dendy." Hagood was the
one who came in with the impressive
rushing average, but it was Dendy
and Lewis who rode roughshod over
the Panther defense. Dendy ran 7
times for 76 yards and a whopping
10.9-yard average. Lewis rushed 8
times for 74 yards and an equally
whopping 9.3-yard average. As a
whole, the South Carolina runners
averaged 6.9 yards per carry.

After the win against East Caroli-
na, John Congemi remarked that,
“This win picks our spirits up tre-
mendously; that happens anytime
you win or something positive
happens." I wonder what will
happen to their spirits now.

times over for Pitt? Soccer team

faces Robert
Morris

By Kirsten Gostony
The Pitt News

It's like attending every class, but
failing to hand in the assignments.
It's like rehearsing for a month, then
not showing up for the performance.
It's putting in long, hard practices,
playing superior defense, yet still
being incapable of scoring.

However redundant it may sound,
the Pitt soccer team's insufficient
scoring has kept them from breaking
close games wide open, and even
worse, has stopped them from
defeating beatable teams.

The Panthers face Robert Morris
College, which is being coached by
former Pitt head coach Leo Bemis,
in this evening's match with hopes of
overcoming this dilemma.

“We're given the opportunities,
and we have the ability, so once we
start putting the ball in the net,
they'll come like crazy," predicts for-
ward Bob Howard.

Despite last year's 2-0 victory over
Robert Morris, coach Joe Luxbach-
er is cautious, saying that RM would
bring a stronger team this year.

“They're trying to upgrade their
soccer program, so Coach Bemis has

 

recruited a lot of fine players. They
may be young, but they're more than
capable to do the job," says
Luxbacher.

Keeping this in mind, Luxbacher.
plans his strategy. “They're a good,
solid team which can score well.
We're going ‘to try some new things
by moving people around and creat-
ing new combinations.
emphasize defense,” he continues,
“yet still try to generate our offense.
Right now theteam is suffering from
lack of confidence, and until we
score some goals, that won't
change.”

Not only will the defense have to
compensate for the lacking goals,
but also for the loss of left defensive
fullback Brian Casey, who will be
out due to a knee injury suffered
against West Virginia. “Although
we have capable replacements for
him, we'll need someone to take his
role as team leader. Someone who

" can bring fire and enthusiasm as he

does," explains Coach Luxbacher.

“Casey is a real importa’nt part of
our defense, but most of all we're
going to miss his organization and
leadership," Howard agreed.

With a record of 5-4-1, and six
games remaining, the Panthers may
still have a chance to contend in the
Big East Championships. “The team
is starting to realize that we have to
get down to some intense work. It's
getting closer to the Big East, and we
really want to be there," explains
Dan Liberati, a freshman out of
Springdale High School, in Ches-
wick. “We'll just have to put our
minds to it." »

“We still have a chance if we do
well in these next six games," says
Luxbacher, “so the next three weeks
will tell the tale."

Face-off is scheduled for 7:15 at
Pitt Stadium.

from Pitt. The Panthers only had 16
open scholarships prior to the '82
season, and by the time Fazio was
named to replace Sherrill on Jan. 18,
all had been filled. Not only that, but
the Panthers had three solid quarter-
back recruits in John Congemi,
Chris Jelic and Rich Bowen.

Though Boardman was not in
Fazio’s recruiting territory at the
time, “I kept telling Jackie this kid’s
like another Marino. But all the
coaches had seen the film, evaluated
him and said he'd be rejected,” Fazio
said. “I thought he was pretty differ-
ent. He seemed to throw differently,
but they all throw differently. I met
him and his dad over the winter.
They understood [the rejection].”

Admittedly, Fazio has to be shak-
ing his head privately now and then.
Maybe if he were only a little more
persuasive. Still, he also admits that

downs (including a school record 85-

against Cincinnati) and is hitting on

“I just try to do the best I can,”
said Kosar, who last week sprained
an ankle in a win over Cincinnati.‘
“I‘m not really trying to get into the
peripheral things — the media atten-
tion placed on me and the team."

If Kosar should be unable to play
against the Panthers, which will not
be known until after Miami’s prac-
tice tomorrow afternoon, Testa-
verde will replace him.

Nonetheless, the attention marks
a contrast of two worlds as com-
pared to Pitt. Once again Fazio will
send a different quarterback to the
helm for Saturday’s game. After as
fine. a performance as can be
expected against South Carolina
last week, Chris Jelic will start
against the Hurricanes and will
likely supplement that with his punt- V
ing duties afterward, should he turn
in an impressive showing in the
Orange Bowl. .

Jelic’s l9 completions of 44
attempts for 262 yards so far might
seem out of place, considering he
asked Fazio during the second day
of fall drills if he could try his talents
in the defense secondary. “I knew a
new group was coming in and I knew
I’d be starting at fourth string [quar-
terback]," Jelic said._ “But I looked
at defense as an opportunity to play.
In the back of my mind I always
knew I’d be back on offense some-
time. I kept the playbook and
looked at it from time to time. Then
coach Fazio approached me and
asked if I'd come back to the
offense.”

“We have to start hitting the inter-
mediate zone,” he said. “Twenty to
thirty yards. That should open up
the underneath [screen plays, short
passes] stuff. And when we start ,, .  ‘ —. _    ' i

“Moore” or less out of fresh   ideas

By~DaIe Moore
The Pitt News

This time of year is terrible for a
sportswriter. The World Series has
ended and has been analyzed so
many times that the subject is off-
limits to everyone except the
extremely rude or extremely drunk.
Football season, especially this sea-
son, is not worth the time of day and
basketball seems too far off to get
excited about.

So what is a writer, and I use that
term loosely, supposed to write
about? When all else fails. look in
another newspaper.

I was short of ideas this week, so I
bought not one, but three newspap-
ers. In three sports sections I
thought surely I would find some-
thing that would arouse my interest,
something that I would disagree
with, something that I could poke
fun at. Something.

I started with USA Today. I
thought this was a good place to
start since it was a national news-

paper. There would certainly be
something I could use or abuse. A
story about a girl who can spin and
balance seven basketballs at once.
Not quite right. How about a few
lines on the Central Collegiate
Hockey Association? Please.

Maybe a local newspaper would
be the place to look. Good home-
town material, something right out
of the backyard. Sounds good. So I
reach for the trusty Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette and Press.

An article about how NBC is
going to put more pro bowling on
television. Thrilling. How about this
one: an offensive lineman for Boston
College that wants to become a pri-
est. Nice try, but it just seems to be
missing something.

After looking through three
sports sections I came to a conclu-
sion. These guys were just as hard up
for ideas as I am. While this made
me feel better for a little while, I
realized that I still had to write this
column and I didn't have any ideas.

Hurry, basketball. Please hurry.

‘Speaking of basketball, NCAA
Division I basketball teams opened

practice two days ago. The Panthers
opened the year without their lead-
ing scorer for the last three seasons
and their second leading scorer from
last season.

Clyde Vaughan, the Panthers all-
time scoring king, graduated and
guard George Allen will have to take
a breather because of academic
problems.

Moore
Ideas

The Panthers have some promis-
ing new talent in Charles Smith and
Demetrius Gore, both of whom were
high school All-Americans last year.

Here’s to hoping.

George Allen isn’t the only player

“in the Big East in the "academic

doghouse.

Georgetown’s designated hit man
Michael Graham and his shaved
head will be absent from the court
this year, KOed by his QPA.

That noise you hear is a sigh of
relief by the other head coaches in
the Big East.

*Edward DeBartolo, Jr., who
owns the San Francisco 49ers, said
Monday that the USFL would fold.

This means that DeBartolo’s
dad's team, the Pittsburgh Maulers,
would bite the dust. ‘

The real question is will there be a
Maulers team left to get the ax?
Rumors abound that the team will
leave town or leave the face of the
earth.

The real answer is in the immortal
words of the Detroit Tiger fans:
Who cares?

Panther Glad man
loves to play

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

Generally speaking, nonconform-
ists don’t attend Garfield High
School in Akron, Ohio. In a similar
vein, freshmen generally do not start
for Division I football programs
unless, of course, that program has
roots in Idaho.

But then again, Charles Gladman
doesn’t know nonconformity from
conformity. Except for his first-year
eligibility status, the 5-11, 205 lb.
tailback has already violated the
first two laws laid down. After rush-
inggfor over 1,600 yards and 26
touchdowns for Garfield Iastyear,
Gladman bucked the well-traveled
path that major college prospects
from his area take to Ohio State and
Michigan. _

While everyone knows those two
Big Ten powers rarely require the
services of underclassmen, Gladman

knew even better. "I knew [Pitt]

needed running backs. I figured
they’d bring all these freshmen in
and give each one a look." '
Gladman arrived with three other
highly touted backs: Craig Hey-
ward, Ezedial Gadson and A. B.
Brown. From day one of fall camp,
however, it was Gladman who was
impressing people like running back
coach Andy Urbanic and head

' coach Foge Fazio. But it wasn’t that

easy, since sophomore Chuckie
Scales. still had the tailback spot
nailed down since spring drills. But

Scales only gained 41 yards against
Brigham Young and since that
below-par performance coincided
with new needs at ﬂanker, Gladman
suddenly found himself being
primed for a starting role two weeks
later against Oklahoma.

“I wanted to be a standout, but I
wasn’t expecting it,” Gladman said
after Scales had become more accus-
tomed to catching instead of carry-
ing the football. “I wanted [the
chance to start], but I didn’t know if
it was going to happen.”

"You try to get up for the
W VU game, and it was rough
 It was a key game for us,
but we had the letdown. I
wonder ifit’sus I’m kind of
disappointed. ”

-Charles Gladman

If Gladman was happy to be
thrust into a new starting role, it
wasn’t the most opportune time for a
new starter, who happens to be a
freshman as well. Pitt was in the’:
midst of throwing 86 times in its first
two games and came away the worse
for it. They concentrated on running

‘the ball like drunkards hate to con-

centrate on speaking their fluent
tongues. »

It wasn’t until a week later,
against Temple, that the Panthers
actually realized a ball-control
offense existed and Gladman fit

right in. The first Pitt back to shatter

the I00-yard plateau this year, Glad-
man picked up ll8 yards on 30 car-
ries and followed the next week with
98 more yards against West
Virginia.

All the while, Pitt kept its losing
streak perfectly intact, a perfect
situation overall fora freshman. The
team can’t get it together, but a
player here or there stands out like a
lighthouse engulfed by thrashing
seas.

“You try to get up for the.West
Virginia game, it was rough,” Glad-
man said. “It was a key game for us,
but we had the letdown. I don’t
know, I’mjust a freshman. I wonder
if it's us. I’m kind of disappointed. I
always feel the pressure. I’m trying
to get better.”

Garfield coach Bill McGee made
sure of that. McGee had Gladman
do everything except cut the grass:
run the ball, return punts and kick-
offs, do some blocking here and

there, maybe run occasional pass.

Sophomore Sue Hoover is a
-reﬂection of the success that
"women's volleyball coach Shelton
Collier has built in his five years at
Pitt. ’

Colh'er’s 169-51 win-loss record
here attests to his inclination toward
success. In 1981 he took the spikers
all the way to a ninth-place ﬁnish in
the country at the AIAW champion-
ships, and in 1983 the squad won the
BigEast Championship en route to a
41-7 record — which translates into
an amazing 854 winning percentage.

1980, Hoover led the team to a fifth-
place finish at the National AAU
Junior Olympic Tournament. The
J ohnstown native helped the team to
finish third in 81-82 and fourth the
following year.

Hoover, a Richland High School
graduate, said that the Junior Olym-
pic experience was extremely benefi-
cial. “It was better competition [than
interscholastic] and it was good
preparation for college competition.”

Knowing Collier from those three
years inﬂuenced her decision to
attend Pitt. “I trusted him and knew
what he expected of his volleyball
players. It’s a great feeling to know
the coach relies on you. Knowing
he’s confident gives me conﬁdence.”

“She graduated with six or seven
other top-caliber high school players
in Western Pennsylvania that were
highly recruited Division 1 players,”
Collier remarked. “I saw a level of
dedication, desire and physical
potential in Sue that really sold-me

on her. She is really coachable and a
great team member."

This_ weekend in Louisiana,
Hoover was selected to the all-
tournament team on the strength of
a consistent performance that
included 48 total kills, second for
Pitt, and 23 in a single match against
Duke. , A

Collier says Hoover, at 5-8, fits
the “Pitt mold" of being too short to
be effective at Division I middle
blocking. “She is proving every wee-

kend that she is capable of outplay— ‘

ing middle blockers that are far
taller and of national caliber."

According to Hoover, the reason
for Pitt’s 16-4 record is rooted in last

season. Midway through the season, ‘

the team traveled to the Purdue Invi-
tational to take on three Top 10
teams, losing all three but coming
away knowing they'd pushed those
three teams to the limit. The sopho-
more compared the Purdue tourna-
ment with the team’s
Tennesseevtwo weekends ago, where
they played three Top 20 teams and
lost.

“I guess we’ve matured over the
year. We learned our lesson last sea-
son at Purdue — we played well, and
then we kind of let down since then. "
She said that learning was reﬂected
in the team’s outstanding play in
Louisiana following the losses at
Tennessee. “[Tennessee] gave us

I more confidence [not to let down]. .

The LSU tournament shows we're
still good." '

Collier said that Hoover’s prim-
ary attribute is her explosiveness‘ at
the net. “She has a quick approach
and fast armswing.” He addedgthat
her quickness helps her on blocking

and on defense. In New Orleans, she

was second for Pitt on digs with 37.

Hoover is looking forward to

which includes a rematch with
defending Big East Champion Prov-
idence. Pitt lost to the Lady Friars in
that ﬁnal, held in Rhode Island, last
season.

“I'm really excited to play Provi-
dence again, playing in front of our
crovvd,” she said. “The whole team’s
telling people to come, and we
expc  there to be a good crowd.”

tory over Stanford last Saturday.

The Texas Longhorns and
Oklahoma Sooners battled to a
15-15 tie in what many observers
called the game for the National

Champion.

PITTSBURGH (UPI) —— The
Pittsburgh Steelers have re-
signed tight end John Rodgers.
Rodgers will take the place of
injured rookie Chris Kolod-
ziejski, who suffered sprained
knee ligaments during last week-
end’s Steeler victory over the San
Francisco 49ers. Rodgers was
one of the last players cut by the
Steelers during the preseason.

PHILADELPHIA (UPI) -
The Philadelphia Eagles made
several roster moves Tuesday in

‘ an effort to shore up their roster.

The Eagles signed cornerback
Lou Rash, a former Pittsburgh
Steeler and quarterback Dean
May. -

, Rash, whom the Steelers cut
during training camp, was signed
to replace all-pro cornerback
Roynell Young, who is on
injured reserve with a strained
stomach muscle. '

May, a Louisville product, i

was cut by the Dophins late in

, training camp after completing ‘
14 passes out of 24 for 163 yards-
during the preseason. The Eagles

cut Bob Holly, a third-year quar-
terback from Princeton, to make
room for May on the roster.
LOS ANGELES (UPI) — The
Los Angeles Rams have lost all-
pro tackle Jackie Slater for the
remainder of the Rams’ game in
New Orleans last Sunday. Slater
underwent surgery Monday to
repair cartilage damage to his
right knee. ’

The high school complete back is

Obviously, he has a long way to go
to become a similar all-around

was at Garfield. His head start, as
opposed to one at OSU or Michi-
gan, can be partly attributed to two
good friends, who matriculated at
Bowling Green State.

for Calgary of the Canadian Foot-
ball League last season, and sopho-
more defensive end Tony Parker
became Gladman’s mentors. Pitt
line coach Gerry Solomon had re-
cruited both Young and Parker
while working as linebacker coach at
Bowling Green, in Ohio, and fit-
tingly brought Gladman to Pitt.

“I know he wasn’t going to b.s.
me," Gladman said of Solomon. “I
felt like ifl was a freshman at Ohio
State or Michigan I'd have to wait in
line. But I got a chance at Pitt. I'm
not going to move [tailback Keith]

good I did, I'd have to wait.”

NEW YORK (UPI) — Three

the free-agent draft is held. Lead-
ing the way is Chicago Cub ace
righthander Rick Sutcliffe. Sut-
cliffe won 20 games this year, 16

Joining Sutcliffe on the free.-

agent list will be New York Yan-
kee outfielder Oscar Gamble and
Atlanta Braves utility player
Jerry Royster. Royster can play
six different positions and is
expected to receive offers from
around the league.
Gamble is comimg off a tough

The Pitt News,.Wednesday,_October. 1.7, 1984 

World Series over, baseball still around

not to participate in a World Series,
not counting teams defunct or teams
that have moved?

0 In the future baseball managers
department, look at newly retired
Joe Morgan, whojust ended his 20-
year career, most recently with the
Oakland A’s.

0 Tonight the Igloo will be rock-
ing over the Lemieux debut against
Vancouver. My prediction for the
Penguins, now that they have three
NHL class liries, centered by
Lemieux, Mike Bullard and Ron
Flockhart, is that they will finish 32-

. 38-10 with 74 points, just ahead of

the Philadelphia Flyers for the last
playoff spot. ‘

I What ever happened to Marc
Boileu?

0 The AFC Central is the joke of
the league. The Steelers at 4-3 are
leading the division by three games,
over Cincinnati and Cleveland, and

will have an artificially high record
at the end of the season, playing the
two Ohio teams and the Houston
Oilers.In the AFC West the Steelers
would be lucky to achieve an 8-8
record. _

0 A post—mortem on the Cubs.
Should they lose Rick Sutcliffe to
free agency, repeating as division
winners in 1985 will be out of the
question.‘

0 What ever happened to Glenn
Beckert?

0 Why is Pitt 1-5? Is it: (a) tough
schedule, (b) lack of imagination on
offense, (c) injury problems, or (d)
bad luck? Picking all of the above
might not be enough.

0 NHL predictions: how about the
New York Islanders and the Buffalo
Sabres in one semifinal and the
Edmonton Oilers facing the Minne-
sota North Stars in the other?
Edmonton will beat Buffalo in six

games.

0 Possible USF L moves: the
Maulers and the Memphis Show-
boats merge and stay in Memphis,
the Houston Gamblers and San
Antonio Guslingers merge and stay
in Memphis, the Denver Gold and
Jacksonville Bulls merge and stay in
Jacksonville, the Los Angeles
Express and the Chicago Blitz merge
and move to Honolulu. The league
will not exist in 1988.

I If Sam Clancy told me that the
Maulers were better off without me,
I would not challenge him. Pack
your bags, Mike Rozier, Houston is
nice this time of year.

0 The lowdown on Mario
Lemieux — he will make Mike Bul-
lard a better player. Teams will put
their best defenders on Lemieux,
leaving Bullard open for a 65-goal
season.

0 Alan Tramell as World Series

page .21. 

MVP? Good choice, but San Diego
relievers Andy Hawkins and Dave
Dravecky put the Padres in the ser-
ies and kept Detroit from blowing
out the house and winning it in four
games and scores lower than I2-4.

0 Is Sparky Anderson the best
manager of all time? Anderson only
does well if he has a team of super-
stars under him; otherwise, he is
only above average.

0 Quiz answer: the Texas
Rangers. The Rangers are a product
of the Expansion Washington Sena-
tors of 1962, not the Senators that
Calvin Griffith moved to Minnesota
_t_hat same year.

0 A final note. Anyone who is as
much a baseball fan as myself should

form a Rotisserie League. You pick .

nine pitchers and 14 players and fol-
low their statistics throughout the
year in eight categories. You may
never root for the home team again.
