Mentor Training
Ends With Unit

Meeting At Noon

Alice Rosenberger To Preside;
Freshman Council Election
Follows Group Division

Miss Amos T—o Speak

Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of wo-
men, will officially close mentor train-
ing and open unit work at the general
assembly for freshman women which
takes place at Heinz House today at
12:30 o’clock.

Alice Rosenberger, Ed35, chairman
of the Organizations committee of
WSGA, will preside at the assembly
and will introduce the unit advisers
to the freshman women.

Immediately after the assembly, the
ﬁrst unit meetings will be held a.nd
the unit groups will lunch together.
During the unit meetings. representa-
tives will be elected to the freshman
council.

A formal dinner will be served to
the council by Cwens, sophomore wo-
men’s honorary activities fraternity,
at Heinz House next Friday.

The social unit proved the favorite
selection of the freshman women for
unit work. Since 70 women chose
this unit, it was divided into two
units, one advised by Maxine Chris-
tensen, C35, and the other by Mar-
guerite Bogaerts, C36.

The next la.rgest unit is the acting,

one, which drew 33 members.

The glee club, public speaking, pub-
lica.tions, and stagecraft units drew
26, 20, 18, and 16 members, respective-
ly, and the dramatic discussion,
sports, science, and literary units
were selected by 14, 11, 10, and 3
freshman women, respectively.

Chest Campaign  
Enters Last Day

Contributions Expected To Top
Last Year’s Total

“Pitt Student Chest is going over
the top,” says Homer C. Vvadsworth,
C-35, president of YMCA and cam-
paign chairman, as the drive which is

Pitt's contribution to the Communityi

Fund, enters its ﬁnal day.

“The present indication is that the
1934 drive will exceed la.st year's to-
tal by about $500,” he asserts, “al-
though this cannot be veriﬁed until
ﬁnal audit is made.”

Universal campus participation was
indicated in 60 reports which had
been made up to late VVednesda.y aft-

ernoon. The average contribution per 

class, according to these reports, is
about $20.

Classes which have not been ap-
proached so far will be contacted to-
day. According to W’. VV. Mendenhall,
executive secretary of YMCA, best re-
turns were made in those classes in
which the Student Chest presentation
was made by the professor or some
member of the class.

Since all students could not be ap-
proached through class groups, indi-
vidual letters will be sent those who
have not yet been contacted.
number was estimated at about 400.

More students participated in Stu-‘

dent Chest than in any other campus
activity, including football games,
Mr. Mendenhall declared.

Student Chest solicitation has been
going on in the Schools of Law. Den-
tistry and Pharmacy. Returns are
not yet complete.

Partial reports, received from the
School of Medicine by Jack Kurtz, ’37,
head chairman, indicate contributions
will be near the 100 per cent mark.

Reports have also been received
from the School of Education and the
School of Business Administration.

Student Chest returns show so far
that 10 per cent have contributed
more than $1, 80 per cent have given
$1, and 10 per cent have given less
than $1. The rate of contribution this
year, however, is much greater than
1933.

Hein:;—A pproves
I10-Foot Spire
For New Chapel

Construction of the Heinz Chapel
lﬂeche has been authorized by How-
ard Heinz, one of the donors. The
tower will rise 110 feet above the
main structure and rest on ﬁve but-
ltresses.

Lead-coated red copper plates will
:be bolted to the framework and will
be removable so that work can be
done on them inside the ﬂeche. The
plates will be lead-coated to protect
them from the sulphur in the Pitts-
burgh atmosphere. Trapdoors and
',ladders built in the steel core of the
lﬂeche will ma.ke the steeple accessi-
lble from the interior. for repairs as
well as for construction.

Tracery- work and gargoyles will be
the decorative motif. Charles Klau-
lder of Philadelphia designed the.
chapel and A. A. Klemcheck is the
supervising architect.

Elliott Discusses
Carnegie Exhibit

Considers Not Emotional Appeal,
But Construction Of Work

Dealing with the underlying con-
struction of the paintings in the Car-
negie International exhibit rather
than with their emotional appeal.
Philip C. Elliott, assistant professor
of ﬁne arts, gave an illustrated lec-
ture on the exhibit Vvednesday even-
ing in Room 202, State hall.

In explaining what he meant by
“underlying construction,” Mr. Elliott
said, “T'here is a language and a
rigidly fundamental vocabulary used
by all true artists. Outwardly they
may appear very faithful to nature or
have no resemblance whatever. Yet
lthe underlying means of communica-
tion, the underlying vocabulary, will
be the same.”

“The question is.” he concluded,
“how can the public be taught to un-
derstand the vocabulary used by
painters? So far, dramatic and lit-
erary critics i: ve built up a union be-
!tween artist and public by literary
and emotional standards, not by
Qstandards of painting as expressed in
:the story element and the underlying
vocabulary. These ends can be made
clear only by a candid explanation by
men who are now exhibiting their
paintings —— an explanation of the
nieans used in communicating the
story element.”

Freshman Wins
National Prize

Essay On 0’Neill Drama Judged
Second In English Contest

John Vverton, C38, has been chosen
winner of the second prize in a na-
tional essay contest sponsored by the
committee on photoplay appreciation
of the National Council of Teachers
of English, The topic of the essay
was the appreciation of Eugene
O’Neill’s play, “Emperor Jones.”

In developing his prize essay, Wer-
ton compared “Emperor Jones” to
“Macbeth” as to character, setting.
and effect. He found it impossible to
separate any one of these elements
from the others in either Shake-
speare’s or O’Neill’s work. The one
thing which he found different was
the manner in which “Jones” grovel-
ed before his apparitions, whereas
“Macbeth” went down ﬁghting.

The judges for the contest were Dr.
Vvalter Barner and Dr. Stella S. Cen-
ter, of the National Council of Teach-
ers of English, DuBose Heyward, au-
thor of the screen version of “Em-
peror Jones,” and Dr. George F.
Zook, former United States Commis-
sioner of Education.

VVerton wrote the prize—winning
essay last winter while a student at
California High school.

Job Opportunities

$carce—- Barton

According to J. 0. Barton, di-
rector of the University employ-
ment bureau, it is now practically
impossible for a student to work
his way through school. The mag-
nitude of the expense and the
scarcity of jobs and salaries con-
tribute to the hopelessness of the
situation.

Although the Employment bu-
reau has succeeded in placing
about 1,600 students during a de-
pression year_ the number of jobs
is steadily decreasing. This is
explained by the fact that the stu-
dent is now competing against
the family man. '

Students willing to be blood-
donors and funeral parlor sleep-
ers are listed on the occupation
application cards issued by the
bureau.

Octogenarian
Play Plea se 3

1934 A udience

By Omer E. Kronenwetter
In presenting Anna Cora Mowatt’s
satirical melodrama, “Fashion,” Pitt
Players undertook a work that had no
capabilities whate-ver for mediocrity;

it was certain to be either 2:. success

or a limitless failure. That it resulted
in the former, and even exceeded all

expectations of that success might be
praise sufficient, were it not that the
“damning with
somewhat
more expansive commendation of the

ancient buga.boo of

faint praise” demands a

performance.

On the surface, the play was an old
farce, cleverly directed, well-acted
and appropriately staged. This might,
perhaps, seem all that is necessary
for successful presentation, but the
degree of excellence in these aspects
ordinarily determines the degree of
success in drama. Not so in “Fash-
ion,” however.

Here was a platform—stage social
satire of the middle nineteenth cen-
tury played before an audience typ-
ical of the cult that applauds (what
the critics call) the better works of
Coward, O'Neill and the rest. A group
of amateur college thespians brushed
from it the eighty years’ dust and

SFA Committee
0pensAssemblies
To Student Body

Association Considers Program
Of Non-I-Iazing Regulations —
For First-Year Men

New Lounge Promised

To avoid becoming a secret body
meeting behind closed doors, the As-
sembly of Student Faculty Associa-
tion, today has opened its future ses-
sions to all interested students of the
University.

Chief among other recommenda-
tions for future action of the group
made at the Tuesday meeting was the
decision to institute a program of
freshman customs for men. A special
committee, working under Charles
Herald, C36, chairman, presented a
report which outlined the advisability

of regulations for first-year men. As-
sembly voted tocontinue activities of
this committee on such a program.

Leonard Marks, C35, chairman, pre-
sided. Reports were heard from
chairmen of sub-committees and spe-
cial SFA representatives.

Measures to promote establishment
of a mixed student lounge either in
Alumni hall or Cathedral were dis-
cussed after Don Campbell, C35, mem-
ber of the Executive committee, re-
ported activity of the committee on
that problem. It was found that im-
mediate establishment of a lounge
would be impossible, but the lounge
was promised for next semester.

The Executive committee also re-
ported that it is considering installa-
tion of a speakers’ bureau, which will
send outstanding students to sur-
rounding high schools to discuss “Go-
ing to college” and “Going to Pitt."
This program was initially sponsored
by ODK, honorary activities frater-
nity, but this group will now work in
conjunction with SFA on the project.

Deﬁnite recommendations adopted
‘by Assembly in regard to freshman
lcustoms include: (1) system of iden-
‘tifying freshmen. with no element of
ridicule or hazing‘ intended; (2)
longer period of education with upper-
classmen counselors; (3) training in
Pitt songs and yells, and establish-
ment of a freshman cheering section
at athletic events; and (4) organiza-
tion of the freshman class, with fu-
ture organization of all classes.

A motion, made by Frank Reich,
C36, to raise a woman member of
Assembly to the Executive committee
as a non-voting representative of Uni-
versity women was ruled out as being
covered by Roberts’ Rules of Order
Revised, Assemb1y’s constitutional
authority. Strong opposition was reg-
[istered by woman members present,
!who were averse to being considered
a special interest minority group.

Graper Analyzes
Election Results

Political Science Head Lectures
Before Inquiry Wednesday

 

Declaring that the New Deal at-
tempts to prevent any great radical

the political science department, an-
alyzed the election results before the‘
Inquiry forum VVednesday.

“This has been one of the most re-
;markable elections we have ever had.”
' Dr. Graper said, “Never before has the
party in power been able to retain its
strength in the House of Representa-
tives in an off year election. The
Democrats had fully expected to lose
as many as 60 seats in the House.
1 However. as a result of last Tuesday's
election their majority is more over-
whelming than it was before."

“One fact of particular interest to

the political scientist is that the num-
[ber of people who vote in an off year
'e1ection-is much smaller than in :3.
presidential election. Not nearly as
many people vote in the United States
as in European countries, such as
,England and Germany,” he stated.

: In regard to the results of the elec-

l

,tion in Pennsylvania, Dr. Graper said:
[“There have been a number of out-
Estanding casualties in the election.
‘We don’t have to go outside of Penn-
isylvania to ﬁnd them, for Senator
David A. Reed, who embodies the
!staunchestprinciples of the Republi-
- can party, 1S a.n excellent example.”
Commenting on the result of the
[election in California and Vvisconsin,
lDr. Graper stated: “One of the big-
gest mistakes Upton Sinclair made
,was in writing a number of books.

i l{.au'r'mann’s Department Stores, Incor- i This is an error for auyolle Who wants
lporated, will be toastmaster for thefl0 T1111 f0F 131113110

office. California
'was literally plastered with excerpts
from Sinc-.lair’s books. However, de-
spite this handicap, the opposition of
Democratic leaders in California, and
the lack of cooperation from Wash-
ington, Sinclair received 78O,749 votes
for governor.

“One of the most interesting fea-
tures of the election was the election
of the La Follette brothers in Wiscon.
sin on the Progressive ticket. It is
notoriously difficult to organize a
Progressive party, yet despite this
fact, and the support which the Na-
tional Democratic committee gave to
their candidates, the La Follettes were

elected.”

1110'd€TX1, Semsllﬁlcient D133"g°e1'S were ! nity which he made the most of with-

not merely amused; they laughed and 

enjoyed it completely. They laughed
because the play came out of the ex-
cruciatingly funny past — just as
theater audiences eighty years from
now will laugh at our Shaws and
Barries and Belascos.

Yet, the Players’ height of a.cliieve-
ment consisted in this, that the audi-
ence appreciated the play for what it
had been, and were, willy-iiilly, car-
ried back to the theater of 1850 to
applaud (in divers manners) an en-
tertaining farce of the day.

“Fashion” by its very nature offered
many opportunities for “heavy” and

over-acted roles. The noveau-riche
society matron, with the single
thought of “doing the fashionable

thing;"’ the honest, upright, typical
(in 1850) American from elsewhere
than the city; the fake foreign noble-
man with his parasitic weakness for
wealthy Colonials; the deep-dyed, n1us-

tachioed villain and all the others are,’

redundantly, charactristic characters.
The plot of the piece can almost be
cited after glancing over the list of
dramatis personaez Tiffany, a New
York merchant, has worked his way
from a peddler’s pack to a thriving
Counting house, and his wife attempts
to surpass this record in social pres-
tige. Count Joliemaitre is the name as-
sumed by an excellent French cook
who seeks the hand, with its accom-
panying jewelry, of the fair Seraphina
Tiffany (beautiful but dumb deb, in
our patois).

Gertrude, the heroine, is a sweet,
unsophisticated young governess who
ﬁnds a husband, a home, a solution to
the difficulties, a long-mislaid grand-
father and several other things while
delivering sundry ultimata on truth,
virtue and the like; at the same time,
she works up a grandiose crescendo
that resolves (with the aid of a dozen
American ﬂags) in a booming, if fal-
setto, epilogue. By this time, of
course. the grandfather lia.s aided in
the expose of the imposter, and the
villainous clerk, who attempts to ruin
Tiffany in a little matter of forgery,
is becomingly foiled.

Carl B. Cass, besides selecting, di-
recting and staging his cleverest play
in his ﬁve years at the University, has
set a new record in casting. This apt
assignment of parts might have only,
if at all, been outdone by the excellent
characterizations of the individual
actors and actresses, since each had to

carry what amounted to a dual rolo——_

than Elbaum,
the villain

in the role of Snobson,
, had an excellent opportu-

out ovcrworking the possibilities in
any degree. His interpretation of the
typical “heavy” miscreant of the melo
drama was superior enough to the ac-
cepted versions to merit ﬁrst laurels.
especially if the appreciative boos and
hisses of the audience are to be taken
as any sort of index.

L011iS€ MCKi1'dY’S Gertrude was un-
impeachably modest and convincingly
unsophisticated. Her cliches, if so
they may be termed, were a.ccomplisl1-
ed, not perpetrated; her bewilderment,
indecision and subsequent joy inacle
her performance a truly excellent one.
Mrs. Tifiaiiy, as played by -Carolyn
‘H’-all, might have stepped directly
from the 1850 stage or one of the boxes
overhanging it; superﬁcially and the-
atrically, high-sounding though they
may be, have a. deﬁnite place in such 2
play, and Miss <H‘all’s rend:3tion left.
little indeed to be desired. Nelson
Mills, as Adam Trueman, the typical
stage Yankee, deserved all the ap-
plause that followed, and frequently
interrupted, his inoral and patriotic
declaratiohs. Both he and Marquis
Patterson (the bogus nobleman) gave
vivid interpretations of roles that were
dii‘1'icult to carry. In the same manner.
the parts of Tii"fany’s daughters Sera-
phina and Prudence, a gossiping
Spinster, played by Betty Knop and
Elizabeth Creese, presented difficulties
that were not only overcome, but cap-
italized on, in an almost professioniil
manner. Millinete, the French maid,
and Zeke. the colored servant, were
svmpatlietically portrayed by Mary Jo
Kunkle and Charles Schott, although
both were somewhat limited by the
script.

The drama having, as has been said,
possibilities for complete failure de-
pendent on a multitude of details, it
may be taken for granted that every
chara.ctei' was .developed to the full,
although some were outstanding be-
cause of circumstance in the original
manuscript or extraordinary interpre-
tation.

One more thing that made the Play-
ers’ prescntation of “Fashion” a de-
cided hit was the quality of the entrn
acts. Much of the credit for these
should be given to Forrest Alter who
made these selections the exact dupli-
cates of those rendered before the cur-
taln 3 Centllry ago. These songs.
dances and recitations, together with
the dancing within the play, were as
much a part of the real “Fashion” as
he exaggerated mannerisms, frequent
asides and didactic outbursts. Ac-
cordingly, they made the play more

complete and entertaining.

Education Aid To International Peace,

Says Seidle, Discussing Pitt-Im China

 

"“Education ﬂosters international

cle,” said Charles A. Seidle, C31, who

'-.wo_rk after three years at Lingnan
‘§lllllVeI‘Slty near Canton, China.

"‘-I-Di?-i--in-China, by aiding Lingnan
university, is strenghtening the ties
between America and China, broad-
ening student interest by being con-
scious of the existence of at least
one school in another country,” he
said.

Lingnan university, where M.r. Sei-
dle was sent from Pitt in 1931, is a
modern Chinese university situated
on an island four miles south of
Canton, the capital of the southern
province of Kwangtuiig

The university proper includes the
Colleges of Agriculture and Arts and
Sciences and the Schools of Business

 

Administration and Engineering.
Work is conducted along the lines of

an American school under the direc-
tion of American and Chinese pro-
fessors.

Pitt-in-China became connected with
Lingnan university, then Canton
Christian college, in 1916. The orig-
inal contribution of $685 grew to $1,-

.787.70 in 1922 but fell sharply during

the last few years,

Asked if the Chinese students were
interested in the University of Pitts-
burgh, Mr. Seidle said: “They are
very enthusiastic and ask me all
sorts of questions. The Cathedral of
Learning in particular excites their
imaginations, and I had to show pic-
tures of it frequently.

“Chinese students are interested in
athletics, particularly track, basket-
ball, and tennis. However, they are
not as much given to extra curricular
activities as American university stu-
dents, although they are active in
publishing Chinese and American
magazines and publishing plays.”

The Mail

Editor, The Pitt News:

It is often stated that history re-
peats itself and for that reason the
following quota‘-.iion seems exceeding-
ly apropos. This statement was made
by a man whose sense of law and
justice have made his fame enduring.
Does it not therefore seem proper that
this opinion should be more highly re-
garded than the many irrational doc-
trines of persons who believe that to
be radical is to be brilliant?

Daniel VVebster, addressing the
United States Senate on March 12,
1838, said:

' “There are persons who constantly
clamor. They complain of oppression,
speculation, and the pernicious inﬂu-
ence of accumulated wealth. They
cry out loudly against all banks and
corporations and all means by which

small capitalists become united in or-

der to produce important and beneﬁ-
cial results. They carry on mad hos-
tility against all established institu-
tions. They would choke the fountain
of industry and dry all streams.

“In a country of unbounded liberty,
they clamor against oppression_ In a
country of perfect equality, they
would move heaven and earth against
privilege and monopoly. In a country
where property is more evenly divided
than anywhere else, they rend the air
shouting agrarian doctrines In a
country where wages of labor are high
beyond parallel, they would teach the
laborer he is but an oppressed slave.

“Sir, what can such men want?
What do they mean? They can want
nothing, sir, but to enjoy the fruits
of other men’s labor. They can mean
nothing but disturbance and disorder,
the diffusion of corrupt principles and
the destruction of the moral senti-
ments .and the moral habits of so-
ciety.”

THEN LEO TOLSTOY announced in What is Art that he consid- i

ered two of his short stories capable of long life and dismissed}
War and Peace and Anna Karenina because they did not possess the -:

ttribiiies of universal, absolute

Tl1e);' are liorriﬁed still by a theory which Henri Bergsoii advanced,
a theory that intuition is a better guide to knowledge than is rational

iliought.

On the other hand, a friend of mince

art, most critics were horriﬁed.

said to me the other evening that it
was impossible to judge a work of art
until it had existed a few hundred
years. ’Ihe opinions of this gentle-
man were probably far closer to the
opinions of critics than those of either
iscrgscn or Tolstoy. Bergson and
Loisroy implied that changing social
COll(llLlJllS would produce needs which
the literature and philosophy that
seems vital to us today could not sat-
isiy. And the critics howled.

'I‘hey howled because they accepted
tacitly the idea which permeates all
ﬁelds of creative thought and criticism
today, the idea that a work of art or
a theory of philosophy is worth-
whi.~e in so far as it coincides with
present-day demands. Perhaps some
of these critics recognize that ideas,
whether philosophic or literary or his-
torical, spring inevitably from the
state of Lhe society in which they
were produced. Perhaps some of them
realize that the differing needs of dif-
ferent epochs require differing satis-
i’actions_ But, so great is their love
of the present that they refuse to con-
sider the question of when and con-
tinue to consider the question of now.

Not that the critics are without tra-
ditional justiﬁcation for their point of‘
view. Ever since the decay of the
Middle Ages men have been domi-
mated by the idea of progress which
Spencer expressed sociologically and
which Darwin expressed biologically
in the nineteenth century_ This idea
gives rise to the belief that the world
has seen from the end of the dark,
gloomy Middle Ages a springing up of
a ClVl.lZal;l0ll which has progressed, is
progi'essing and will continue to
progress, This belief, blind as it may
be, is implicit even in the doctrines
of i'ev;>lut.io1iaries, who attack the in-
stitutions of our own times and who
speak at some length of the decay of
society. Revolutionaries demand that
beneﬁts deriving from such types of
thought—beneﬁis niaterial, since both
they and their ideological parents
spring from. science and teclinics——
should be extended to all persons,
while the conservatives demand that
a relative few should beneﬁt.

To express the idea crudely in an-
otlier way, all the intellectuals, with
a few exceptions, are prepared to
glorify thought for the sake of thought

and science for the sake of science.
i“rie mechanical and scientiﬁc achieve-
ments of our age, they say, are the
greatest achievement of humanity.i
But, however beneﬁcial the speciﬁc
material effects of science and tech-
nics may be, their deirication gives
rise to 2. non-human, non-historical
nie'tl.iod of thought. This method is
based on the easily observed oneness
in ideology which has existed from the
Renaissance to the present day and
above which only a few novelists, like
Jane Austen. a.nd a few philosophers,
like Bergson and I/Villiain .l'am.es, have
risen. It is based further on a fond-
ness for the products of the ideology
and on a dislike for any departure
from current methods of thought.
The intellectuals assume next that

height of health of a civilization rather
than the ideological and practical
preparation for such heights. Some
are revolutionary, but only to the ex-
tent that they wish to bring about
broad applications of present-clay
thouglit. All assume that melancholy
and pessiinistic inquiry into all parts
and 0l)_‘l€(‘.l'S cf the universe is natural
to all civilizations, Shakespeare
looked gloomily into human charac-
ter; D:irwin looked scientiﬁcally into
biology; Galileo looked coolly into the
heavens; therefore these men have
presented universal truth of method.

No one stops to consider the fact
that these thinkers have paid no at-

to acquire knowledge about 3. mechan-

The-y forget that :1 society in which
men live happily and fully has en-
tirely different concepts of space and!
tinie and thought from societies which ;
are attempting, however unconscious-j
ly, to seek a basis for a new society}
and which are engaged in sloughingl
off the superstitions which brought
about the decay of the old. Highly!
beneﬁcial, no doubt, is the thought in!
which they engage, but it is beneﬁciall,
not for its own sake. but only insofar}
as it prepares the way for a stable,l
new civilization. I

What then is the worth of speciﬁc!
artistic and philosophic theories,

springing from a society which pro-
duces for its own sake and not for the
sake of future times? For a time, no
doubt. these theories encourage a type
of thinking which can ﬂourish at ﬁrst!
only if it considers itself capable of
absolute. i.l‘l.lZll; but, when there is
necessity for transition to application
of new ideas for the establishment of
a genuinely stable and healthy society,
this type. of thought still proclaims its
universality. In the time of Athens,
the scpliists destroyed the basically
irrational scientiﬁc doctrines of the
Greek metaphysicians They turned
attention to man, but since they were
not possessed of the tool of historical
perspective tliey were unable to build.

Today, men like Bergson and James.
have destroyed the basically irrational
scientiﬁc doctrines of our own physi-,
cists and metaphysicians. And today
we are possessed of the tool of his-
torical understanding, which we can
use to build if_ we use it properly.
But, before we build we must judge
the speciﬁc worth of our artistic and
scientiﬁc productions relatively and
not absolutely. The doctrines of
Drmocritus and the dramas of Euri-
pides were of worth to their own and
other ages only insofar as they
slough-ed off prejudices and supersti-
tions. Today the doctrines of a Dar-
win and the human—nature investiga-
tions of :1 Shakespeare are of similar
worth.

intellectuals shrink from the reali-
zation that understanding of the
relative and limited truth of our
whole system of thought, to which we
11a‘-.'<-3. been paying liomage for so long
a time, precedes construction, We
must not throw overboard a great deal
of baggage, but we must understand
its limited use. Unless we. ourselves.
proclaim the limitations of our intel-
lectual tradition we cannot construct
anything having vitality or stability,
because of our incomplete use of the
tool of historical perspective. Future
generations then will have to undergo
the raw social dislocations which the
historical process, working in uncon-I
trolled manner as it proclaims thosel
limitations, will produce, VVesterni
civilization had to undergo such dislo-I
cations after the fall of Rome. i

was an all-A student, naturally absent-

climb the front steps of State hall,
when he was supposed to be using the
lower door, and reported him.

The freshman was brought in and
told to stand before his judges. “Un-
button your coat!” someone snapped,
and this he hurried to do, fumbling
with the buttons. “Button down your
coat!” another ordered nnd when he
nervously began to button up his
coat, the entire court bellowed, “But-
ton it down!" More rattled than ever,
the A-student did this. “Sing the

dent of the court ordered. The fresh-
man accomplished this after much
hesitation. “Court will come to or-
der!” (Apparently all that went be-
fore was merely hors-eplay, and not in
the form of tribunal.) “State the of-
tense of this child.”

In a deep voice, another sophomore
boomed, “This ignoramus has violated
the sanctiﬁed privilege of uppercla.ss-
men by traversing the main steps of
State hall.” This, next to assassina-

court places upon the defendant?”

They grabbed the boy, held his head

back to the front of his head, using
the clippers none too gently.

three months the boy faced his friends

Pubiic Response

To N atiohal Union For Social Justice

‘By Edwin P. Banks

America has unnumbered champions
of the economic underdog, but none
has succeeded in rolling his oratory
over so vast and widespread an audi-
ence as has Father Coughlin in his
radio talks Sunday afternoons.

The Detroit priest attracts millions
of people to their loudspeakers to hear
his ranting denunciations of Vvall
Street and communism, among the
many being the mother of this COll1lllll-
ist. And while the ﬁery Father is de-
nouncing, one might as well put aside
his books or his daydreams and listen.

When a man of the clergy speaks
on a purely political or economic topic
over a nationwide hookup, no com-
mentator, it is obvious, is making re-
flections on the Church if he criticizes
the purely secular beliefs of the
preacher. It is of Father Coughlin‘s
non-religious opinions that I should
like to make a. few observations.

Last Sunday the radio priest resum-
ed his series of broadcasts by announc-
ing the birth of the National Union for
Social Justice and the platform of the
league. The local paper we get at
home did not bother to publish the
Father’s program, for some reason, so
that I set down some of the provisions
as I recall hearing them through the
loudspeaker. The Catholic churchman_
among other declarations, advocated
nationalization of the banking sys-
tem and public ownership of light,
power, gas, and oil; lie hailed the de-

cay of reactionary capitalism and
warned against the rising tide of red
radicalism; and he allowed the Dem-
ocratic administration to understand‘
that he did not approve of its crop and
livestock destruction policy. His new
political group, he stated, is plerlged
fundamentally to further the redistri-
bution of wealth.

Father Coughlin has
thrown his hat into the political ring.
His aim now is to organize the gi'e:.i.t
masses of his radio followers, Protest-

ant Catholic_ and Jewish, into an ef--

fective progressive. group.

There is no doubt that the priest’s
program is socialistic. There is no
doubt, too, that because of its pink
tinge, it will be violently attacked by
conservative forces throughout the na-
tion, as Father -Coughlih realizes.

The important question is whetln—;r
his backers will arise from the passive
role of listeners to the militant role
of an active political group. The au-
swer to this question should throw
needed light on the public attitude to-
ward the New Deal. The American
people, as the recent election proved
to the discomfort of Republicans, are
overwhelmingly for Roosevelt and his
recovery measures. But are the peo-
ple satisﬁed with the President’s mild
liberalism, or did they vote Demo-
cratic because they believe he will
move further to the left?

That is the question which the pub-
lic response to The National Union for
Social Justice should answer.

A crowd separated me from the
bakery counter, where the last case
of cakes was being sold. For a min-
ute I wandered about trying to flank
the cluster, watching the number of
packages decrease A white cap
floated back and forth on the. level of
the heads before me.

“Oh, Anna Mae!” I called, “Salvage
a cake for me, will you?" The cap
jerked up, turned toward me, and
ﬁnally nodded. The persons near me
turned and looked, “Boy-friend!”
[someone whispered.

A minute later she walked to the
end of the counter, handed me the
package and took my 5'0-cent piece.
“Thanks a 1ot,”I smiled, and she
answered, “Oh that’s 0. K.” and hur-
ried back to the scowling woman who
wanted donuts.

Outside I handed the package to the
folks in the car, and remarked, “Got
out of there pretty slick. That's what
it is to have a drag. You wait here
and I’ll get some ice cream.”

At lsa.ly’s the crowd was equally
large, crushing itself against the
whole length of counter. Vvhere I
ﬁnally sneaked in, we were three deep.
More white caps ﬂoated back and
forth, The voice beneath one of these
said, “Yes?" to the girl before me. I»
recognized it. “Hi there Jack!” I
claimed hiin_ “Rescue a brick for me,
will ya?"

“Sure,” his answer came, as his
hand waved above the plume on the
girl’s hat. “Sure thing, Lloyd," The
cap ﬂoated away and returned. I
slipped my hand through the group
and handed him a bill, The cap
swam away again. VVhen he came
back, a. few coins and a package lay
in my palm. I twisted away as the
girl turned her head. “Drag,” she
sneered, and I smiled. Jack and I
used to hitch-hike to Oakland together.

When I returned to the car and
slipped beneath the wheel, I explained,
I “I knew Anna Mae in high school, and
Jack over at Pitt my freshman year.”

“H1nmn1,” said my Dad, thoughtful-
,ly. “You knew her three years ago,
land him two.”

i “Yes,” I added, “and because we

were friends and did algebra together,
they are still willing to befriend me.”

"Hmmm,” again.
; “And I had no reason to expect it
:at. all," I added,
l Then my brother chirped in. “Now
if they were fraternity brothers of
yours, and bwned bond houses and

“Z\-Iaybe that is why a young man
should join one,” I suggested, and Dad
merely “Hinmm”ed again.

The Pitt News

Panthers Seek To Halt Navy Victory
Pro;c__essionAAt Annapolis Tomorrow

Tilt To Have Bearing
On Eastein Title;
Pitt Favored

It is very unlikely that ever be-
fore in the history of Thompson
stadium at Annapolis has there
been as much glamour surround-
ing a football game played there
as will be the case when Pitt

meets the Navy tomorrow.

The Navy boys set out from port
this season with a desire for a long
cruise on waves of victory and the
crew hasn’t once dropped anchor. At
present, the ﬂeet is standing outside
the harbor, with only the rocks of
Pittsburgh and the shoals of the Army
remaining between it and the conclu-
sion of a most successful cruise. The
rocks of Pittsburgh must be dealt with
tomorrow.

Looking at the problem from the
Pitt standpoint, it is found that the
Navy is the last opponent on the
schedule for the Panthers to gain any
prestige by beating. Just as a Navy
victory over Pitt will put the Middies
in the very front rank of Eastern con-
tenders for the football title, so would
a Panther victory put the Pitts right
up front when the leading names are
called. And should the Pitt victory
be as decisive as the betting boys sug-
gest it may be, then the mouthings of
the people of Western Pennsylvania
will certainly have to be heard.

'Navy ls Strong

The Navy has not come this far
without showing plenty. From “Buzz”
Borries, brilliant red-headed backﬁeld
ace, on down to the slightest substi-
tute, the Middies have shown a ﬁght-
ing spirit that wins ball games. Last
week’s showing against the Irish of
Notre Dame, who outplayed the mid-
shipmen,’ clearly showed that a ﬁght-
ing ball club can make up for a lot of
defects by pure grit.

But the Navy has something else.
They have a passing attack that com-
bines laterals with forwards until the
spectators’ heads swim and they have
backs who can run and run over the
white lines. The line has been get-
ting stronger with every game, with
the two guards, Captain Burns and
Zabriskie, as stand-out performers.
Burns is a guard of the watch-charm
variety but has played a full term for
two seasons and has done very well
indeed_ Zabriskie is a six-footer who
has developed into a running guard
who mews down the opposition with
clock-like regularity,

Also prominent in the line are a
tackle named Cutter and center nam-
er Robertshaw_ ‘Cutter is another
third year ﬁrst-string man and in the
off-season has found time to hold the
heavyweight boxing championship for
two years. Cutter is said to play his
best under ﬁre and by that criterion
he ought to be hot against the Pan-
thers when Munjas starts sending
those power plays off-tackle. Robert-
shaw has advanced this season from
a second-string berth to the ﬁrst out-
fit and plays each game in a manner
intended to make Coach Hamilton and
his associates wonder just why he was
ever considered as second-string ma-
terial.

Pitt In Good Shape

Pitt will come up to the game fresh
after a handy victory over Nebraska.
Some say that Pitt never knew its
own strength until it started to show
off oefore the good people of Lincoln
last week. At any rate, the success

the Panthers had with their wide-open .

style of play is certain to make that
style get another booking at some
stage of tomorrow’s game. Navy is
not adverse to throwing the ball
around, either, and if worst comes to
worst the officials may simply stretch
a volleyball net across the 50-yard line
and let the boys have fun.

The Panthers are out for more seri-
ous things. however. The ﬁnal shot at
big time targets will have them ready
to cut loose with everything in the
book. Every man on the ﬁrst outﬁt
is in good shape with the exception of
Verne Baxter, right end, Baxter is
bothered by an injured leg, and in the
event that he is unable to play his
place will be taken by Vin Sites.
Sites showed up well in the Notre
Dame game here and his presence in
the lineup shou1dn’t hurt the Panther
power,

Squad Drills At Capital

A squad of 33 men left late last
night for Vvashington, D, C, where
they will stay until shortly before
game-time tomorrow. A practice is
scheduled for the Georgetown univer-
sity ﬁeld this afternoon. The men
making the trip were the same ones
who made the Nebraska tour, with
the exception of James Scarfpin and
Gene Stoughton who went in place of
John Valenti and Vince Hanley.

Last year's Pitt-Navy score was 3 -
6 when Chung-Hoon and his mates
just coul<ln’t get started against the
ferocious Panthers. That will be. just
another thing which Coach Hamilton
may mention in his pre-game pep talk
to the Navy.

8-0 battle with Golanty’s Sammies.

Action was very slow in the ﬁrst
few minutes of play. Aside from the
hard-charging of Delta Tau Delta’s
line, the play was quite listless. Go-
lanty returned the Delt Hepburn’s
kick-off to his own 20, Two succes-
sive poor kicks, the ﬁrst being re-
covered by Pinsky on the second
down, placed the Sammies in the
shadow of their goal posts. On the
fourth down, Pinsky’s subsequent bob-

fJohn Baker fell on the ball for the
Ionly touchdown of the game. Hep-

ﬁrst down for Sigma Alpha Mu on the
Delt 25.

In the second period, the Sammies
menopolized most of the play. On a
pass, Golanty to Baskin, Davis partial-
ly intercepted, and the ball bounded
into Baskin’s arms for a 20-yard gain
and another ﬁrst down_ Davis inter-
cepted Golanty’s pass on fourth down
to stop this touchdown drive, Davis
kicked to midﬁeld as the half ended
with the Delts still leading, 6-0.

Early in the fourth period fumbles
again proved costly to Sigma Alpha
Mu. After Gelanty intercepted Davis’s
pass to Pritchard on the ﬁve—yard
stripe, the Sammies lined up in a
wide punt formation. A wild pass
from center to Golanty behind the
goal line scored a safety and two
points for the Delts, Shortly after
this the Delts on a sustained drive
reached striking distance of the goal
line, Two successive incomplete
passes both from Davis to Vlfillison,
culminated the drive. The ﬁnal whis-
tle sounded with the score remain-
ing Delts, 8 and Sammies, 0.

ment, which will consist merely of
shoes, trunks, shirt, and towel. They

arranged for the freshman team. The
games are usually booked a week or;
two in advance of the game. Severali
district frosh teams will be played as i
usual, including the Tech plebes, Duke i
frosh, West Virginia freshmen, Kiski,!
and perhaps the Penn State yearlings.
The remainder of the 20 game:
schedule will be rounded out withi

Panhel Rushing
Plans Enforcing
Pitt Regulations;
Emphasis Placed On Academic

Side; Number Entering For
Social Reasons Reduced

By Charlotte Atwell

“Iiiiportant things come ﬁr_st.” de-
clared Muriel Dils, Ed35, president of
Panhellenic council, in discussing the
Council’s policy of deferred rushing.

About ten years ago, Panhellenici
council established the rule of de-
ferred rushing until the second semes-
ter. Under this plan, University stand-
ards are safeguarded by reducing the
number of students who_ enter the
University for purely social reasons,
and by putting the ﬂrst em_DhaS}S up_0n
the academic side of University life
for freshmen. _ _ _

The system digniﬁes the indlvldllal
fraternity by giving them an ODDOI"
tunity to base invitation to meII_1be1‘-
ship on real acquaintance or friend-
ship, rather than on ﬁrstappearance;
by safeguarding a fraternity ,f1:0m 113"‘
ing pledges who cannot be initiated_be-
cause of low grades; and by reliev-.,
ing the fraternity each 3'8’-11‘ Of 3
number of immature freshmen iiii-
oriented to the University life in gen-
eral, thus giving the fraternity an 013- -
portunjtv to develop more effectively
for upperclass women the real values

of the fraternity,
Past experience has taught the
Council that when freshmen are

selected in the ﬁrst semester, each
fraternity has had to spend, an undue
amount of time each Yea? 111 °“enta'
tion problems, By making member‘
ship in a fraternity something to be
achieved through the test ot_intei-
lectual ability and the observation of
the individual’s social worth over a
period of time, the plan helps the f1'a'
ternity group, ,

The individual freshman is D1‘0t_€Ct'
ed by the plan of putting first things
ﬁrst and the proof that she is capa-
ble df doing University work. By SW-
ing her an opportunity to know the
University as 3, whole, to become.
somewhat oriented to it before focus-
ing attention upon a small group; _bY
giving her a chance. to have wide
knowledge of fraternities, and thus to
make an intelligent choice; and DY
giving her a real appreciation of a

By Ruth A. Nickel

Lulu Stilley, Ed35, holds both
the women’s indoor and outdoor
highboard and lowboard diving
championships of Vvestern Penn-
sylvania. Besides being the
youngest Red Cross lifesaving
examiner in Pittsburgh, she swims
and dives for the Keystone Ath-
letic club. "

W'hile in high school, Miss
Stilley decided to specialize in
highboard diving. She was

trained by John Carik, a former
University diving star. In 1932,
when she was a high school
senior, she entered the Olympic
tryouts at Jones Beach, Long
lslaiid. She was commended by
the judges for her fancy dives.
Miss Stilley is preparing to
teach physical education, but she
may make a career of diving or
coach of a swimming team.
