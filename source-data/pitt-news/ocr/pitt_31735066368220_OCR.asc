Flu Diagnosed

    

Two students who thought
they had food poisoning after
eating in the Towers cafeteria
Monday night were diagnosed
yesterday as suffering from
intestinal flu.

Dr. Pamela Bowen of the Stu-
dent Health Service said the two
students reported to the service
last night complaining of vom-
iting and diarrhea. Though the
students thought they had got-
ten sick from eating in the Tow-
ers that night, Bowen said there
was no evidence of food
poisoning.

“Only two of the 2,500 stu-
dents who ate in the cafeteria

a case of food poisoning,” she
said.

Ken Buetow, the resident
director on dutyxwhen the stu-
dents reported the illness, said
the students thought they
might have gotten sick from
eating scallops that were served '
at the dinner. The Office of Res-
idence Life will be looking into
the matter he said.

Charity Drive

A charity drive for Children’s
Hospital will be conducted by
the Student Relations Commit-
tee of the Student Government
Board.

Speaking for the group,
Megan Murphey said that they
'hope to raise a thousand dol-
lars. The money will be used to
help people who can’t afford to
pay their hospital bills.

_ The Student Relations Com-

mittee will be selling paper
links to raise money. The red

A suit filed in November

by a Pitt student has now
become an “internal police

ties involved.

Lewis Pearson filed a suit

Board against officer Vernon
Barkley on Nov. 15 in which
Pearson alleged that Barkley
physically and verbally

employee and that each depart-
ment deals with matters such as
this internally.

Lt. James Watters of the
police department’s adminis-
trative services said that in his I
opinion, the incident was never
a judicial matter.

“We have our own internal
affairs department,” he said.
“Whenever a citizen files a com-
plaint against one of our offic-
ers, it must be filed with that
department."

Watters said that director of
public safety William Tucker is
currently investigating Pear-
son’s charges, but he did not say

McGovern
Redirect Priorities

By RAY WUSLICH

The United States faces eco-
nomic catastrophe and a decay in

its quality of life unless it beings

the arms race under control, former
U.S. Senator George McGovern
"said last night.

In a speech sponsored by the Pitt
Program Council, McGovern said
that instead of increasing the mil-
itary budget, the country should
finance the reconstruction of its
decaying physical structure.

“I do not want to see the quality
life in this country be sacrificed any
further to feed something that I
think threatens the very survival of
life itself,” McGovern said.

The money the government has
saved-by cutting social services has
been more than offset by the
increase in military expenditures,
McGovern said. He predicted that
Reagan would end up responsible
for the biggest budget deficit in
history.

“We are neglecting the internal
economic, physical suprastructure
that sustains our hopes for a pros-

perous and quality society,” he
said.

McGovern argued that the U.S.,
instead of increasing military
spending, should deal with “the
decaying infrastructure of the
country: its water systems, sewage
systems, streets, highways and
bridges.”

“It would be much cheaper,
though certainly not cheap, for
America to begin revitalizing those
existing facilities than it would be
to let them collapse and have to
build them from scratch 10 or 15
years down the road,” he said.

McGovern said that it was
inspiring to come to Pittsburgh

and see all of the construction pro-V ,

jects to upgrade and improve the
city. This kind of renovation "is not
characteristic of many parts of the
country, he said.

While it is important that Amer-
ica rebuild cities and highways, it
is also important not to allow the
railway system to deteriorate,
McGovern said.

“For some reason the American

stay in Pittsburgh sponsored by the
Central American Mobilization
Coalition.

Lara said he was tortured and
jailed for his union activities while
he was living in El Salvador, and
this is the reason that he fled his
country to live in the United States

He said he has had difficulty
with his speaking tour because he
has been attempting to fight the
media boycott concerning news on
El Salvador. He said he was
ignored by the two major Pitts-
burgh newspapers, The Pittsburgh
Press and Post-Gazette, which did
not grant him coverage.

With the assistance of a transla-
tor, Lara said accurate coverage of
events in El Salvador is crucial and
that the “media boycott" reflects
pressure from the Reagan adminis-
tration on the American media not
to cast its policies in an unfavora-
ble light.

Lara said it is important that
people understand that the strug-
gles taking place in El Salvador are
“not caused or directed by any for-
eign powers.” He added that such
fighting has gone on for more than
half a century and has been
brought about——not by groups of
subversives or communists—but
by all types of groups of Salvado-
ran people,

“The media,”. he said, in addi-
tion to explaining this mispercep-
tion, have not shown that “the
Frente Farabundo Marti for
National Liberation Front
(FMLN) has won victories over the
Salvadoran government’s army.”

According to week-old figures to
which Lara has access, the FMLN
has caused 558 casualities. It has
also taken many government soldi-
ers prisoner to be released later to
the Red Cross or if the prisoners
wish, to be integrated into the
FMLN to fight for the cause. The
struggle there is one for political
power—the aim is the creation of a
government representative of the
people, according to Lara.

In view of the fact that Reagan
has left for a trip to South America
yesterday, Lara took the opportun-
ity to speculate on what Reagan’s
aims there could be.

“Principally, Reagan’s aims are
to rebuild American policy toward
Latin America,” he said. “But, in
the long run, he will use a form of
economic blackmail to force
regimes to fall into line." _

Lara again stressed the impor-

tance of accurate media coverage in‘

this. Coverage is essential ifAmeri-

cans are to be aware that Reagan’s

policies toward Latin America are

the harshest. they have been since
the 19305.

“If they were aware,” he said,
“they could pressure their govern-
ment into stopping the military
and economic aid it gives to sup-
port the regime in El Salvador.

“There is no doubt that the most
significant factor that stops our
(Salvadoran) people from obtain-
ing their rights is the military and
economic aid given to the Salvado-
ran government,” Lara said. He
said that it is for that reason that he
urges people to write their con-
gressman and representatives.

Lara said that continued aid to
El Salvador as a result will enable
the regime there to continue to
repress the civilian population. He
added that in late January Reagan
will be approaching Congress
again and it is anticipated that he
will tell Congress that the human
rights situation in El Salvador is
much better, a claim that Lara
strongly disagrees with because he
said he sees American policies as
fueling the war in El Salvador.

“The people of El Salvador are
fighting for the creation of a popu-
lar government and a popular
army—an army that is not over the
people like the present one s.up-
ported by the U.S. is,” Lara said.

Repression, according to Lara,
has actually been stepped up in El
Salvador, another development
that the media has not reported.
Lara explained that in direct con-
flict the U.S. backed regime cannot
be defeated but if people pressure
their government to cut aid to the
regime then the junta can be
defeated.

“Reagan is not interested in dia-
logue,” he said, “he seeks a mil-
itary solution to the situation in _’f

Salvador. He has destabilized the” “*3

economies of Nicaragua and he
seeks to destabilize the economies
of other Latin American coun-
tries,” according to Lara. “This,”
he said, “has dangerous conse-
quences, because countries like
mine are in the rifle sights.”

taken if Barkley was found to be
in the wrong.

“Those decisions are insti-
tuted by those in charge of the
particular administrative
department,” Watters said.

Jim Brady, the Legal Aware-
ness Committee lawyer repres-
enting Pearson, said he was
surprised by the turn of events
in the case.

. “I didn’t know anything
about it until you (the reporter)
gave me that information,” he
said.

Although Brady did not say
what he thought about the out-
come, he did say he was curious
about why the case did not go
before the Campus Judicial

‘Board and questioned the out-

come of the investigation.

“I just wonder how fair the
outcome is going to be since it
(the police department) is going
to be investigating one of its
own men,” Brady said.

Pearson, his brother Anthony
Pearson and a friend, Lyden
Van Johnson, were involved in
the incident on Sept. 15 in
which Barkley pursued Lewis
Pearson because he was creat-
ing a disturbance in Lothrop
Hall, police reports said.

Pearson maintained in his
suit that Barkley was verbally
abusive and beat him with his
night stick, causing him to seek
hospital treatment.

In early October, Barkley
filed a suit with the Student
Judicial Board and Pearson was
found guilty of assaulting Bark-
ley during the same incident.

Pearson said that it was self-
defense and that he believed the
judicial board failed to take that
into consideration. The judi-
cial board will not hear his
counter suit because of Tucker’s
decisions.

slow the trains down to seven or
eight miles an hour to keep them
from falling off of the tracks.”

According to McGovern, there
are things which are not profitable
to preserve, but which we may
need. The railroads and the envir-
onment belong in this category, he
said.

“When I read about this MX
missile, now called the dense pack,
I think the people that are pushing
it are the dense pack," McGovern
said.

According to iVIcGovern, both
the United,States and the Soviet
Union have enough weapons for
mutual annihilation. There is no
point in adding any more nuclear
missiles. Quoting Winston Chur-
chill, he said that adding more mis-
siles to existing stockpiles will only
mean that we can bounce the rub-

ble a little higher.

Citing a former Ambassador to
the Soviet Union, Thomas Wat-
son, McGovern said that if the
Soviet Union and the United States
continue on their present course of
accelerating the stockpiles of
nuclear weapons, each side going
for some imaginary margin of
superiority over the other, that
nuclear war will probably come in
l0 to 20 years.

 Opinion  

_TT

Of Course

Pitt may boast that its cosmopolitan atmos-
phere promotes critical thought and satisfies
the objectives of a liberal education, but some-
times Pitt sees the outside world with blinders.

In spite of frequent defeatist moaning that
students are apathetic and self-centered, the
concern about issues of national and interna-
tional import is actually increasing. Case in
point—the popularity and strength of the arms
control movement is growing and shows no
signs of slowing. I Nuc1ear—related issues,
however, can be clouded and misrepresented if
they are explained only in the rhetoric of either
extreme. Moreover, with the MX missile plan
becoming a volatile issue, it is clear that critical
examination of these issues needs to begin at all
levels.

One level that is unfortunately ignored is at
the university. Interdisciplinary courses on
nuclear war, disarmament and deterrence the-
ory need to be introduced into the curriculum.
This administration professes an interest in fos-
tering intelligent debate, but constructing
courses designed to do this would show that Pitt
is more than all talk and no action.

This idea is not new.

Other universities have offered courses and
programs about arms control for more than a
decade. The number of courses and of their
enrollment is increasing, according to The New
York Times (Nov. 30, 1982). The article cited
that enrollment in the course “The Nuclear
Age” offered at Harvard University stands at
140. That’s up from 60 in 1977.

Granted, courses about such emotional issues
could generate some sparked class discussion
and reveal the political bent of Pitt's faculty,
but these are hardly reasons not to discuss the
issue.

If the aim of our educational system is to
avoid examining all issues in depth, then what
is the purpose of education?

The administration and those responsible for
planning curriculum should seriously re-
examine their roles if they continue this
moratorium.

Many groups on campus exist for the sole
purpose of discussion. An example is the Pitt
Arms Race Study Group. Still, there aren’t any
courses in the history, philosophy or political
science departments that deal exculsively with
the topic of nuclear war. The interest is there,
the need is there, but the courses—for some
reason-—are not.

Her Pen Speaks The Truth...

Dear Editor:

Christina Clinton’s penetrat-
ing sociological analyses regu-
larly appearing in The Pitt
News, ranging from such
diverse subjects as sexism in
rock lyrics and rudeness in bars
to the pandemic disease of cam-
pus drinking and murderous
impulses triggered by video
games are utterly provacative,
brilliant and socially relevant.
She has become our most astute
observer of the modern pop
scene; sort of like a too-serious
Tom Wolfe.

Initially, I thought that The
Pitt News was having problems
with low circulation and had
Christina, a master satirist,
churn out some intentionally
soft headed, infantile fodder for
the apathetic Pitt student body
to really get mad at, react to,
protest and excercise its consti-
tutional right to look stupid.
This all happened.

Blistering letters denouncing
and villifying Ms. Clinton came
pouring in. Up around Bene-
dum Hall tempers were really
boiling over her rock lyrics and
drinking columns, booze and
Who lyrics; hit ’em where they
live. The opinions page has
become the most interesting
part of the paper to read, nar-

Dear Editor:

President Reagan has decided on
a basing plan for the MX missile,

and funding decisions for the mis-

sile system will be made soon in
Congress. His “dense pack” prop-
osal, the latest in a series of propos-
als for deploying the MX, has
generated more controversy among
both experts and concerned citizens
than many of the earlier basing
ideas. This missile system will cost
the treasury as much as $40 billion
and will not provide us with more
security for two reasons:

OTlii,s expensive initiative will
only be met by a Soviet move,
which will lead to more billions
spent on this side of the ocean, etc.,
etc.

0'l‘he “dense pack" basing is far
from technologically proyen.

Efforts are being made to fight
this waste of money (55-10’ billion
co'ultl go a long way if applied to
education...). Concerned citizens

But I was dead wrong. Chris-
tina is totally serious, and she
has the might of right on her
side. What a firebrand she is. I
have no doubt that the negative
feedback from her video games
piece will be earthshaking. But
like the consumate professional
that she is, she will weather the
storm, for her pen speaks the
truth.

I sincerely hope that Christi-
na’s elevation, in January, to

the position of editor-in-chief
will not diminish her prolific
literary output. Someone has to
stand up for our rights and pro--
tect us, by God, from rampag-
ing space cruisers and small

...Or Does It?

Dear Editor:

Why should the readers of any
paper, especially a purportedly lib-
eral college paper, be subjected
time and time again to such a nau-
seating spew of asinine moralis-
ing? I'm referring to Christina
Clinton’s most recent failure at
incisive social commentary.

Instead of investigating one of
the many interesting angles to
which the current video game
malaise lends itself, Clinton choses
to back out yet another petty and

simplistic harangue. Is this Christ-
mas any different than others? Does
society face a potential showdown
with marauding, bloodthristy
video drones? Must these boxes of
hyper-space and projectiles be SE1}:
pressed for public good?

I happen to think very little of
video games, but they are certainly
above the abyssmally amateur
social psychological assesment
Christina Clinton affords them.

of the White Tower?” These gut
feelings survive. The question is,
“How do we get over them?"

The Yale Daily News put'out a
book called “The Insider’s Guide
to Colleges and Universities,”
which, in effect, said Pitt’s a good
school. It isn’t the center of the uni-
verse, but again, it never claimed to
be. Hot dang, aren‘t those people
nice.

Forget them, we don’t have to
lick their crumbs. The last four
presidents of the U.S. have been
pick-yourself-up-by-the-boot-
straps types, some of whom made a
point to sneer at East Coast estab-
lishment, types. A little sneering
never hurt, but keep it to your
friends, the next snot~nose you
meet may be your future employer.
Like Ronald Reagan, we who
graduate from middle-class schools
don’t need a penchant for sticking
to dry facts. Like Gerald Ford, we
don’t have to act smooth in public.
Like Jimmy Carter, we can play
softball. And like LBJ, we canpick

our dogs up by the ears and damn
the consequences.

In other words, we can be loud,
obnoxious, crude and ethnic if we
want. In other words, we can be
American.

We may not be the center of the
universe, but we are at the cross-
roads of the nation, we’re the steel
backbone, the blue~collar work-
place, a place for many business
headquarters and a definite nuclear
target. So pick a fight with your
friend from Cornell if you’d like.

If we offended anybody by men-
tioning Jodie Foster, so be it. Gad-
flies can be good for taking your
mind off other, more pressing,

~problems. I doubt if The Yale

Daily News and Jodie Foster will
pick this sucker up, but if they
want to start a rumble, we’re ready.

All About Eve

Editor’s note: Eve Shelnutt, author of two short story collections,
“The Love Child” (Black Sparrow Press, 1979) and the “Formal
Voice” (Black Sparrow Press, 1982), is tenured associate professor
of English at Pitt. Recently, she was interviewed for The Pitt News-
/ Backspace Literary Supplement. Her most recent work, a collection
of poetry entitled, “Air and Salt,” ﬁuill be published in April of next
year by Carnegie-Mellon University Press. Shelnutt responded to
some questions prepared by Backspace Magazine editor Walter Ray
Watson.

Pitt News/ Backspace Literary Supplement: When did you first
know that you wanted to be a writer?

Shelnutt: It’s strange to me that there was, in fact, a day when I knew
that I wanted to be a writer. Almost by accident, I had wandered into a
short-story writing course in Dayton, Ohio. The first assignment was
to write a complete short story.

Of course, I had no idea how to write a story, but the problems I
encountered while trying so interested me that I knew I would at least
be writing until I discovered why I had become so interested in the
process. Probably it was much later that I felt enough confidence to
say I wanted to be a writer, but certainly it was that first experience
which affected me initially. I say immediately how complex a form the
story is. I supposed I liked what I sensed were its formal demands.
PNBLS: Was your early life a proper environment for creativity?
Shelnutt: I’m not quite sure what a “proper” environment would be.
Some very creative people have come from environments which
could be considered impoverished in terms of intellectual stimulus.
But to try to answer what I take to be the spirit of your question: Igrew
up in the South, among talkers who liked to make stories out of
ordinary incidents. And we had good books in the house: no televi-
sion. My mother played the violin well, often in an orchestra, and I
took violin, piano, and voice lessons. My parents were educated and it
was expected that we would excel in school. I’m not sure, as I said,
that such a background constitutes a “proper environment for crea-
tivity” but it is my background.

PNBLS: Did any family member influence your choice of pursuing
the arts?

Shelnutt: My mother, I think. And my older sister, who played the
piano. I remember loving to watch them practice——the look of con-
centration. I think that once I had given up playing the violin, I was
searching for something to do or to make which would require that
same level of concentration, something which would somehow
answer for me what I had found so pleasing while watching them
practice.

PNBLS: How long have you been writing seriously?

Shelnutt: I think since 1972. I hadn’t taken a writing course after the
one I took in Dayton, and in 1972 I found myself enrolled in the MFA
Program at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro. I had
put myself through what I considered an apprenticeship, of writing a
short story a week in order to learn craft, but I had written very little
that I liked. I think that by enrolling in the Greensboro MFA Program I
was announcing to myself that I would take the writing seriously
enough to see if I could write something which pleased me. As I said, I
had read a great deal—I knew something of what would please me in a
story. I chose, very deliberately, to study with Fred Chappell, who
was then the Director of the Greensboro MFA Program. I liked his
writing, his sense of form, the depth of the themes he was willing to try
to get into his fiction. I suspected he would be a harsh critic. Also, his
novels, to my mind, could have been written by no one else. I liked
that fact, which seemed a most elusive quality: how to make a story
uniquely one’s own. I was writing stories anyone could have written
and I knew that the sort of story was not what had excited me about
the form.

I had also been offered a fellowship, and I think that I went to
Greensboro with a sense of freedom——freedom, you understand,
within the confines of my critical judgement, which was finding my
own writing very inadequate. It was as if I gave myself two years in
which to “see,” to do anything with language and the story form I
wanted, while a teacher I considered to be extremely intelligent
looked on. It was, in my mind, “now or never,” and I took the writing
seriously in a new way.

PNBLS: How long did it take you to become established? (i.e.
accepted to the point that a press would publish a collection of your
work?)

Shelnutt: I left Greensboro in the summer of 1973 and published the
first collection in 1979. “The Love Child“ contains 19 stories, 18 of
which first appeared in literary journals, so the time from ‘73-‘79 was
spent in writing and publishing the stories which appeared in that
collection. I was also writing and publishing poems as well as working
on several of the stories which appear in the second collection.
PNBLS: What is the purpose of your fiction?

Shelnutt: I must give the standard answer: to deepen my own, and I
hope the reader’s, sense of what it means to be human. I like to try to
define or redefine in my stories common words such as “grace,”
“light,” “descant,” “apprentice,” “craving,” and I like to write _about
the most ordinary people, without making their ordinariness the point
so much as the adjunctive to an exploration of how ordinary people
make their lives honorable or morally important or merely bearable.
PNBLS: Is literature as a whole for the sole purpose of
entertainment?

Schelnutt: Well, of course, one would have to define “entertain-
ment.” I think that people who read literature or attend to any of the
arts need from the form an invitation which seems appealing. After
the artist’s invitation is accepted, I think something other than enter-
tainment is what keeps the reader, viewer, etc. attending to the work,
maybe a promise of satisfaction through form of that which can’t be
satisfied in any other way. .

PNBLS: What is it that divides literature from craft?

 

Shelnutt: This something which I often discuss with students in my
classes, and we’ve found no ready answer. From what I know from
reading and from experience while writing, I would have to guess that
the quality is, maybe, a powerful coming together of craft and emo-
tional legitimacy, when form and deep feeling meld.

PNBLS: What should every writer concern himself with when he
writes a story?

Shelnutt: I would like to amend any question which has the word
“every” in it; I have, after all, only my own experiences as a writer and
whose few I can divine from what other writers say about themselves
and their work. And I don’t think I can ever stress enough the
importance of learning one’s craft. However, having qualified my
answer, I would say that what I find most important—what is for me
an overriding concern, is the quality of my concentration on the place
in which I put my characters and the language by which I write about
place, situation and characters——that I use only words which do not
violate their presence as I envision it in a place.

PNBLS: In your writing classes, what is the consensus on the respect
students have for literature of the past?

Shelnutt: I’m sure that every teacher of English wishes that his
students had read more. However, I’ve found that the most serious of
our writing students are eager to read the classics, to discover
through reading what constitutes the tradition in the form in which

,  _ / I’! I /
- /

/ ,2

 ’

they are writing. I have a great deal of sympathy for what we are
requiring of our students, given that many come from high schools
which did not require much reading. I think they do want to be well
read and realize that they have much ahead of them as readers who
want also to write. I don’t find that our most ambitious writing
students shy away from literature of the past but rather find it essen-
tial to their education.

PNBLS: Is truth the basic concern of writing? That is, through
imagination on the part of the writer, should he choose to allow what
is ‘truth’ to surface of its own volition or should he seek to impose
‘truth’ on a poem story, etc?

Shelnutt: An imposed ‘truth’ is apt to sound false. Writing, it seems
to me, is an act of discovery, not a manner in which one finds a place
to state what he already feels are truths. Such impositions would
become boring and would be seen as boring to the reader. If charac-
ters come alive, if language is powerful, then the writer, it seems to
me, would be in a new position intellectually, morally, emotionally
with each piece of writing. I like to think of the creative act as small
moments of decision within the confines of form and the discipline of
craft. To deny oneself those decisions would be a violation, I think.
PNBLS: Are you currently at work on a novel/short story/ collection
of poetry?

Shelnutt: I’m working on a novella, some stories and poems. One
form gives rest from another.

PNBLS: Do you have any favorite writers?

Shelnutt: I admire Eudora Weltry a great deal, her stories especially,
and, of those tho nnes least anthologized, such as “At the Landing”
and “No Place for You, My Love.” I admire Katherine Porter and, of
Mann, “Dr. Faustus,” above all. I admire many stories of Paul Bowles
and several of Jane Bowles. I like Mary Lavin’s work a great deal, as
well as that of Nadine Gordimer. I’m puzzled and fascinated by
Henrich Von Kleist. I admire Conrad tremendously. I read Elizabeth
Bishop’s poetry often, as well as Wallace Stevens’. I like Louise
Bogan’s poetry. But I’ve left many out, too.

PNBLS: How do you begin work on a story? Do you set aside time
each week for writing? How do you move from the ideas of characters
in your head to actually placing them on paper?

Jerzy Kosinski :

 

To Tell The
Truth?

 

“There’s a thin line between yellow journalism and investigative
reporting.” ——from a recent editorial in the Wilkinsburg Gazette

The Wilkinsburg Gazette couldn’t really mean that, could they?
The statement, to put it in its original context, was an apology for
reporting done on the superintendent of Wilkinsburg schools, Dr.
Richard E. Davis. Of course, there appear to be more reasons rising
by the hour for observers of the media to ditch questioning such an
assertion-——instead, they agree wholeheartedly that the ‘thin line’
continues to dissolve as we breathe. In quite an indirect way, this
brings us to the case of that ‘thin line’ as it pertains to writer Jerzy
Kosinski.

Kosinski has often been at the center of controversy surrounding
Kosinski. The latest cycle of confusion began in late winter/early

~ springfwith the publication of what some have labelled a ‘glowing’

appreciation of Kosinski in a cover story written by Barbara Gelb for
The New York Times_Magazine.

The article glossed over the controversies surrounding Kosinski’s
early life in Poland, how he started writing in the United States, as well
as how he escaped the Nazi death camps. To label the piece a
‘glowing’ appreciation is to state the obvious. To write this way isn’t
bad, really. It is just below one’s expectations of what is to be consi-
dered in the best interest of journalism. But, expectations were meant
to be lowered. Nobody’s perfect. (Remember the article on Kampu-
chea in NYT Magazine last December, which was fabricated and
rewritten from earlier pieces appearing in Time?)

To make matters worse (or better, depending on your perspec-
tive), reporters Eliot Fremont-Smith and Geoffrey Stokes of the New
York-based weekly The Village Voice wrote an article for that paper
on June 22 of this year claiming that Kosinski’s fiction was written in
English with collaborators. Kosinski called them “assistants.”

Fremont-Smith and Stokes assert in the article, “Jerzy Kosinski’s
Tainted Words,” that his most honored and prized work, “The
Painted Bird, ” was the work of Kosinski with the solicited help of
outsiders to better serve the language and work choice throughout
that work, as well as other works he has written including “Steps,”,
which won the National Book Award when it was published.

To say the least, the piece by Fremont-Smith and Stokes was not
very favorable in its conclusions of Kosinski. The conclusions that

suit! be drawn. in fast. sussested strongly that Kosinski’s literary life
t us far has been very much a fraud. And this is just the beginning.

On Nov. 7, in the arts and leisure section of the Sunday New York
Times, Times reporter John Corry wrote a piece that renounced
each and every claim made by the Voice. The Times’countercharge,
entitled, “17 Years of Ideological Attack on a Cultural Target,”
defends Kosinski on every front.

In part of what can be called “countering the countercharge”
reporter-columnist Alexander Cockburn wrote in the Nov. 16 Voice
that the Times consciously went out on a limb to vindicate Kosinski.
First, putting reporter Michiko Kukutani to work, and then, after
Kukutani was unable to find any substantially “pro-Kosinski” mate-
rial, enlisting the services of reporter John Corry to do what Cock-
burn (and many fair-minded people) consider ‘dirty work.’ The editor
assigning Kukutani and Corry was A.M. Rosenthal, executive editor
of the Times Magazine.

And so the fighting between the two organizations goes on, the end
nowhere in sight. Corry claims that The Village Voice has allied itself
with Polish Communists who would like no more than to discredit
Kosinski. This claim propelled a Voice editorial to clearly deny any
association, before, during or after the piece by Fremont-Smith and
Stokes, with the Polish Communists. The Times’claim is considered
by many to be ‘red-baiting.’ That’s at best. At worst, it’s below any
sense of journalistic responsiblity.

In this haze of making claims and counterclaims, accusations‘ and
innuendos, the original reason for any of this gets lost. John Corry
said in his piece that, by virtue of his several articles and television
appearances on TV talk shows, Kosinski is a public person, not a
highly secretive man as the Voice reporters had stated.

He is shrouded in mystery and vague generalities concerning his
past, present and future. Kosinski does little or nothing to make sense
of his life. His fictional work, as both Corry and the Voice reporters
concurred (indirectly, of course) has been the center of attention.
Here ’s why: When someone claims Kosinski’s work to be autobiogra-
phical, he defends the work as fiction; when someone calls the work
purely fiction, he claims that it is all true (not authentic or realistic, but
true). Which brings us full circle, or just past the start of all this
madness——the claims by The Village Voice. Kosinski refuses to sue
the Voice’s reportage.

Why won’t Jerzy Kosinski defend himself if, in fact, what Fremont-
Smith and Stokes claim. isn’t factual? In the Corry piece, Kosinski is
quoted as saying, ‘‘I must prove that I even exist.... I would be the last
person in the world to use the law to sue The Village Voice. My whole
dramatic predicament has been individual. What do I do now? Say to
society, ‘Rescue me?’ ” Kosinski’s action in this matter is justified by
Corry’s label of Kosinski as a “First Amendment Absolutist.”

Kosinski goes on to say, “It’s fascinating how the guilt sets in. One’s
inner reality is eroded, and then comes the real panic. I wake up now
feeling guilty.... How can I actually prove I have written a book? Of
course I know myself, but who can I point it out to? If I write
something, they will put a headline on it: ‘Jerzy Kosinski still insists he
writes his own books.’ ” This stance is perhaps the perfect luxury for
an author, in fact, a celebrated writer, who can afford to make the
meekest denials of the mystery and confusion that has worked to help
stir even more chaos.

For Kosinski, straddling the fence between defending his honor
and stopping short of admitting any validity in the claims by the Voice
reporters is the ideal position to take. It is ideal because no lawyers
will be payed to pursue this case, to hunt down people to vouch for
him. It is ideal because in terms of the sheer publicity, Kosinski has

little or no footwork to do, except to say, “They’re wrong. These
people are being mean to me. It doesn’t matter what I say or do. I
know I am right and that is all that matters.”

Perhaps knowing what the truth of the matter is, is the key to the
problem of who’s right, and who wrote a novel. This is where the point
of entry should be made, instead of at “They wrote their piece for the
sake of protecting their friend Jerzy Kosinski.” Or, “They wrote their
article to help the Polish Communists out of a real rut. We’re right,
they’re wrong.” This waste of space can go on forever.

The conclusion to be drawn from all of this, sadly, is that after the
gallant effort to try to discern fact from fiction, fantasy from reality,
one must wash his hands of the entire fiasco. Forget saving face,
forget taking sides and forget the fact that any further discussion of
how full-blown this situation has become is without redemption.
Accept that Jerzy Kosinski does not mind his predicament enough to
mount an assault against his accusers.

What’s more, consider that in recent years Kosinski has not written
a work (by himself or with help) that has had the power, impact or
grace of “The Painted Bird.” Given this fact, the final question that
bounces into the back of my mind is, “Why should anyone care?”
Yes, he is a naturalized citizen, and yes, the claim that he didn’t write a
great classic in Holocaust literature is an absurd dog to let sleep, but
consider what remains to be done about it.Kosinski is resolved to the
attention that this thrust upon him. There should always be a broad
division between yellow journalism and investigative reporting. lt’s
time that someone turned his back to show that mudslinging, biased
reporting and ﬂailing innuendoes is not the stuff of the average

journalist. It’s for the birds. WALTER RAY WATSON

 

     

   

Truly

Updikian
BECH IS BACK

John Updike

Knopf

Once again America’s foremost

g-

writer brings his personal touch to -5
yet another set of uniquely Updikian" 

problems. This time the protagonist
is not the ubiquitous Rabbit Ang-
strom of “Rabbit Run,” “Rabbit
Redux” and “Rabbit is Rich” fame.
Instead, Updike resurrects yet
another" character—Henry Bech.
When last heard from, Bech was an
unproductive writer living out his life
in the shadow of his former works.
In “Bech is Back,” he returns to pen
a bestseller, turn fifty, do his obliga-
tory six minutes on the morning talk
show, become cultural ambassador
to third world countries, fall in love
and survive through it all with that
most Updikian of characteristics-
guilt.

In a recent Time interview,
Updike remarked that he created
Henry Bech to show that he was a
Jewish writer too. With all the typi-
cal Updikian panache, he piles guilt
upon guilt, problem upon hilarious
problem, on Henry Bech. A man
who hasn’t produced any meaning-
ful work in at least a decade, Bech
finds himself remembered through
the undying fame of his last works.
He supports himself during this lean
period by appearing at colleges giv-
ing lectures. When, once again, his
past fame becko_ns, he’s off to a Car-
ribean island to“ personally auto-
graph “Twenty eight thousand five
hundred tip-in sheets of high rag
content paper, at the rate of one
dollar fifty a sheet.” In the end, with
a note of bell-like irony, Bech is
unable to sign his name.

In “Bech is Back” the characteris-
tic neurosis is there. The usual set-
ting of family and fidelity challenges
the unbearable and yet most satisfy-
ing pleasures of illicit sex. In Henry
Bech, we see a man who overcomes
his writing block, produces a best
seller titled “Easy Money” and mar-
ries a WASP, Bea. Later, he com-
mits adultery on Bea’s son Donald’s
bed. And as his marriage to Bea
slowly falls apart, we see him again
enjoying the fame that “Easy
Money” has brought him only to see
him realize that there's only one
word which describes his life and
work. Unclean. '

And if Bech’s work and world is
unclean, what is Updike’s?

It would be too much to say that
Henry Bech is the last word on being
a— writer in America. Yet, once again,
Updike has taken us to a region
where all that glisters is not gold,
and the characters are the first and
the last to know it.

Lynn Chu’s Violin

Smooth wood kernel nestled

within gooseﬂesh and velvet—-—-

It was her trademark, the silver bullet

She left behind, in the bus _

or under the desk. I thought at first

She didn’t like the violin, until

I saw her racing the halls

like a lover recalling past neglect,
Interrupting History, murmuring
Apologies framed in the doorway.
Squinting slightly, Lynn swooped,

The bow of delight drawn across her face.
This loss and rapt recovery

went on for the dozen years I knew her.
Yet I, who never lost a book or note,
Have lately lost my friend, Lynn Chu.

I’ve considered radio announcements and
even painting the sides of boxcars

“Who knows Lynn Chu?” to race

And find her. Only Magritte might paint me
Solace—picture: a solitary VIOLIN
Secure, enigmatic,

Floating in an empty classroom.

A bell rings somewhere down the corridor
Marking the beginning, or the end.

Small feet run against the crowd.

The Student Union, Once Schenley Hotel

Today my sore throat was well
so I could smoke, like a
man. That had been troubling me.
And a book of Joseph Cornell
held out on a long crabby stick
by the Public Library
enticed me to return
six books, for absolution and Cornell,
all his heirlooms,
of glass and wood,

refusing to condescend to our century of aborigines

and misbehavior. And in

some seriousness .

I sat in the Student Union

thinking that in more fabulous years

it was a hotel, tho they have contracted

to correct that.

Why, I thought, if I’d relaxed

among the letterheads, tassels, mirrors

and frescoes, the aluminum, the travelogues,
wardrobe and hat-rack, ’
of recarpeted unremembered Suite 614,

poverty, careless of selling or

of postcards of the Lido

and the Alhambra and the Chrysler Building
and the Hotel Schenley

to a trendy shop for kids without glamour,
like me, who, spellbound,

Love for Old Stern

Let’s drive to the airport again.

Let’s buy magazines and gum from the small shops.
Then I’ll can’t help but remember

how I felt when Stern left for New York,

his huge hat, the sad coat,

his hand on the back of my neck.

His cities are Pittsburgh and New York and Philadelphia.
Mine is in my dream;

the one with long sidewalks

lined with trees and narrow houses

and Stern’s ghost

stirring leaves and paper,

the coats of old men.

He leans on the warm side of a building,
stares into his palms,

notices how the sun at this late hour
can change the color of anything.

He floats through long corridors,
remembers the old feelings

and waves from the windows of trains.
He listens to the river.

His poems sigh and sigh.

I imagine a young Stern

weaving through crowds

down on 35th Street,

carrying a bundle of clean clothes,
-wrapped in_ brown paper.

He climbs the fire escape

behind the Murray Hill Hotel

two steps at a time.

I imagine I see him I

in Philadelphia in the Broad Street Diner
on a Sunday.

He is smiling, older

and keeping warm under the woolen cap.
But I’m in Pittsburgh and I remember
how cold the sidewalks were outside

that dry December

we heard him reading poems at the University.

I remember how

my heart broke again
and again,

how my wife squeezed
my left arm, whispering,
“Don’t cry, don’t cry.”

Rivalry
Remains
Robust

:5...

By MARK A. SINDLER

It’s a rivalry that dates almost as
far back as Hector and Achilles.
When Pitt and Duquesne yearly
match basketball teams, the scena-
rio is enlarged. The fans love it.
The players make it a real physical
struggle on the court. And for the
two coaching staffs, well, the
game's outcome means doom or
bragging rights in Pittsburgh bas-
ketball circles.

The fans entered the act early in
this year‘s edition last night. A Pitt-
Duquesne match would not be
complete without signs, of which
Duke fans” had plenty. Placards
declared: “Nice Hair, Chipman,”
“Dear Roy, Dye It Or Shave It" and
“Pitt—Big East Doormat.”

There were, of course, the very
distasteful kinds, and due to con-
tent, these signs are not reproduci-
ble in print. Does this dim the
image of Duquesne?

Not so, according to one overly-
boisterous Duke fan. “Sure, it
doesn’t look good for Duquesne,
but it’s only a couple of kids with
the signs,” he said. “Those are the
bad apples, but besides, that’s how
school spirit is generated....This is
an intense game; the fans are into
this game.”

One gray—haired man in his for-
ties agreed. “The rivalry has to be
there because these are inner-city
schools and (the game) is televised
everywhere. It’s played a little too
early, I think. It’s still the football
season; if you play later, this is the
only game in town.”

junior forward Clyde Vaughan
wouldn't miss this game—no way,
no how—despite a badly bruised
back he sustained during practice.
“I wouldn't miss this even if I
couldn't walk,” he said after the
final shot was fired.

Another junior, Duquesne
guard Andy Sisinni, is pleased

Panthers
Run Past
Dukes

By SCOTT DELLETT

It typified a Pitt-Duquesne
game—hard fought, rough edged,
bodies flying around the floor and
turnovers galore. Even though they
only play once a year, little has
changed.

“We played hard, “Duquesne
coach Jim Satalin said. “It was a
physical game.”

“It had the same intensity as the
other Pitt-Duquesne games,” Pitt
head coach Roy Chipman said.

Even though the Panthers had a
definite talent advantage, they just
managed to shake off pesky
Duquesne 62-53 last night before
7,980—mostly Duke fans——at the
Civic Arena.

Although most expected a
Panther rout, Roy Chipman didn’t
believe this.

“I can’t remember a Pitt-
Duquesne game being decided by
more than three or four points,” he
said. “I give Jim Satalin and his
kids a lot of credit.”

“I didn’t think it was nine-point
game,” Satalin said. “It was a
three-four point game really.”

For a while it looked as if the
unlikely would happen—a Pitt
upset by Duquesne. Using a patent
offense that found holes in the
Panther zone and a hard-nosed
defense that kept the ball away
from Clyde Vaughan, the Dukes
managed to go into the locker
room at halftime tied at 28.

Even in the opening moments of
the second half, Duquesne took
control as an Emmett Sellers layup
gave the Dukes a brief 30-28 lead.
But Pitt ran off the next eight
points on two long jumpers and a
pair of free throws by Vaughan and
a layup by George Allen.

During this period, forward Bill
Searles committed his fourth foul.
The senior forward lead Duquesne
with 18 points—l2 in the first half
as Duquesne shot 60 percent in the

first 20 minutes. _

The evidence supporting the
notion that collegiatesports-

particularly—are big busi-
nesses is staggering. In fact. it's
sufficient reason fora prosecut-

Pitt will earn roughly 32 mil-
lion playing Southern Metho-
dist in the (lotton Bowl, while

Penn State will take home
about $1.8 million from its
Sugar Bowl matchup against
Georgia.

The many remaining bowls
need not be mentioned, except

pating teams are rising about as
quickly as the cost of living.
The medium-sized bowls, like

involved. are increasing the
stakes in an effort to catch up
with the major bowls. Last year,
the Fiesta Bowl was attractive
enough to draw a Penn State-
Southern (lalifornia contest.

As in the game of Monopoly,
teams search out where they'd
like to land, then strive to reach
their destination. The Rose
Bowl aside—-where both partic-
ipants are chosen by conference
standings—l,’itt this year has
landed the Boardwalk of all
bowls, the Cotton Bowl.

As in Monopoly, there can be
motives for not wanting to
reach Boardwalk level. A player
might rather own a monopoly
on red spaces—Kentucky, Illi-
nois and lndiana—rather than
the higher-valued blue areas of

the Boardwalk and Park Place; -

an opposing player has a
greater chance of landing on
one-of-three than on one-of-
two; , , ,

Penn State had its choice of

Collegiate Sports Are Big Business

which bowl to attend this year,
and it opted for the Sugar, the
Kentucky Avenue of football
bowls, for the sake of playing
Georgia for the national
championship.

Clemson, last year’s national
champions, landed on a chance
space. “Go Directly To jail,”
the card read. “Do Not Attend A
Bowl. Do Not CollectA Million
Dollars.” The Tigers, having
been found guilty of recruiting
violations, did collect one of the
most severe penalties ever
handed down by the NCAA.

Which only brings to mind
the many cases of corruption in
the big business world of col-
lege sports. Arizona State, USC -
and Clemson, three football
powerhouses, are currently on
probation.

Each case stemmed from
recruiting violation, which
only serves to show that for
some schools—perhaps
many—-in collegiate athletics

have become a win-at-all-costs
proposition. It's reaching the
point where the only question
to ask is, “Who is going to be
next?”

Still doubt that college sports
are big businesses? Consider
some comments made by no less
an authority than Pitt’s athletic

‘director, Dr. Edward Bozik, in

his inaugural speech.

“Intercollegiate athletics are
big business,” Bozik said, “and
I intend to treat them as such.”

“How do you stand on the
issue of lights at Pitt Stadium,”
one reporter asked. “We’ll look
it over, and if it’s economically
feasible. . 

The message seems clear: The
objective, as in Monopoly, is to
make money; to build the foot-
ball and basketball programs
from a blank to a one-house
structure to a hotel. Once there,
the objective is to keep the
opposition from reaching that

level.

Pitt went from wasteland to
hotel in a short span. Along the
way came more evidence of big-
business: single game crowds
sometimes larger than what the
Pirates draw in a week and a
half; lucrative television con-
tracts that with football and
basketball combined, will this
year bring Pitt well over $1 mil-
lion in additional revenue-
probably closer to $2 million.
That is on top of the $2 million
for Pitt's part in the Cotton
Bowl, the money on tickets
from home games and the
money gained from each road
game, which is said to range
from $50,000 to $150,000.

Granted, Pitt is one of few
schools that has reached such a
lofty level. Now, its job is to
remain there and prevent the
building schools from overtak-
ing it.

It’s one giant Monopoly
game based on the world of big

business.

  Russian

By BRIAN BALK

A meet against the National
University Russian team next
Monday is not a competition in
which the Panther gymnasts are
expected to emerge victorious.

“It is unfair regardless of how
good they are,” said Pitt coach
Frank D’Amico. “This interna-
tional meet is a start for Pitt
Gymnastics—men’s and
women’s—to reach a national
caliber level," D’Amico said.

D’Amico’s expectations are not
set on winning this meet. Instead,
they are focused on eventually tak-
ing the team to nationals. The
Soviets meet is just a stepping stone
in reaching this goal.

When the Soviet team
announced they were traveling,
invitations were sent to a select few
schools. “It was a great honor to be
chosen as one of those schools,”
D’ Amico said.

D’Amico is determined to show
the Soviets that Pitt indeed does
have a growing gymnastics
program.

In Russia, gymnastics is compar-
able to football in America or
hockey in Canada. It is estimated
that 7 million Russian athletes par-
ticipate in gymnastics. The
National University alone has 1.50
members on its roster. The Pan-
thers have 12 gymnasts.

D’Amico may not have as many
high-caliber gymnasts to draw
from as do the Russians, but that
will not have that great of an effect

‘ on the meet.

“We’re looking to do clean
routines--clean and strong is what
we’re shooting for,” said D’Amico.

The Panthers have had a rela-
tively short period in which to pre-
pare for the Russians. They have
been training for three months,
which is not ample time to really
master routines.

The Russians, on the other
hand, have been training for eight
months.

The Pitt News, Wednesday December.l, 1982 '

coach Frank D‘Amico (left) is featured here with A. J. Noce President of South Gate Datsun (middle) Joe
Femianl (right) and Don Bagnato President of Surburban Lodging Inc. (seated).

Bringing the Russians to Pitt is a
major expense. D’Amico sought
out A.]. Noce, president of South
Gate Da.tsun, to sponsor this
expensive competition.

He also called upon Don Bag-
nato, president of the Surburban
Lodging Inc., to house the Russian

delegation at the South Hills
Sheraton.

D’Amico said that ,with the help
of the sponsors, this is the first meet
in which the Panthers will actually
come out on top—money-wise.

Additionally, the meet will
prime the Panthers for another

important competition in two
weeks—the Farmingdale Open.
The Panthers will travel to Long
Island, New YO‘r'k”t”o compete in a
meet that will be an early indicator
of Eastern rankings.

“We may have a chance at win-
ning the East, or at least be a possi-

Venzon photo

ble dominating factor,” said
D’Amico. The ‘meet against the
Russians has forced Panther gym-
nasts to work harder than they usu-
ally would early in the season.

So Pitt may not out—scOre its
Soviet opponents, bu the meet will
be a worthwhile experience.

Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo.
When looking at this title at first
glanceone may fall into a state of
confusion. They may think its
some nuclear power plant on a
deserted landscape.

Cal Poly-SLO is a university
situatated near the Pacific Ocean in
California. The school is also the
Pitt Lady Panther volleyball
team’s opponents in the first round
of the NCAA semifinals, scheduled
to start at 6 p.m. Saturday.

Except for some players, who
ventured into volleyball-infested
jungle of the West last year and
defeated t.op-ranked Pepperdine
and California-Berkeley, this
weekend’s match will be a new
experience to many Lady Panthers.

Cal Poly-SLO, currently ranked
seventh nationally, with a 25-9
record, is seated seventh out of the
'28 teams competing in the region-
als, and has been ranked as high as
No. 2.

For Pitt’s Coach Shelton Collier,
any victory the team has will be
considered an upset.

“All we have to do here, is tell the
girls that this is their one shot,”
Collier said. “We have to prepare
well now, then go there and play
well. If we get beat, I want to come
home proud, and this will only be
if we play a great match.”

Whether or not Collier’s practice
sessions over the last 10 days are an
indication of Pitt's ability to defeat
a Cal Poly-SLO-type team, the
training has been demanding and
intense.

Just last week members of the
men’s volleyball team worked out
with the Lady Panthers, setting
and smashing spikes to the girls on
the other side of the net. This
caliber of play comes close to what
Pitt will face during the
tournament. --

The men were also used as block-
ing decoys in the face oftheoutside
hitters’ smashes over the top. This
is probably the one area where Pitt
will not fare well. Said Collier,
who “expects (Cal Poly-SLO)‘to be
one of the best defensive teams,”
the team sports two 6-2 and 6-1
middle blockers and has four play-
ers over 6-0.

Freshman Carmen Tapia, a mid-
dle blocker, is Collier’s tallest
player at 5-11.

Despite this lack of size Collier
has instituted “club psychology”
on the team to deal with this disad-
vantage. For more l0 days now,
before each practice, there are 20-
minute team meetings at which
certain topics are discussed.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY

HAROLD BROWN

 

PITTSBURGH!!! ‘

F ,

The Pitt News, Wednesday December 1, 1982

One such topic deals with the
fact that Pitt is the underdog. Col-
lier does not want the team to have
any false expectations.

“We have a one-in-five chance of
winning this match,” Collier said.
“We have to do everything now to
arrange the circumstances so that
the one happens.”

Another topic covered is
patience. And as Collier pointed
out, it is especially now that the
Lady Panthers must be aware of
this.

“We have the capabilities to do
it,” he continued. “If we played a
San Diego State or Hawaii...the
elite teams, then I'd say, ‘Let’s get

some experience,’ but this is
different.
“We can’t show frustration

when Cal Poly starts beating us,
but remain calm while we get our
butts kicked. With patience we
have to adjust to their caliber of
play."

If there is one thing Collier
hopes will work to his advantage, it
is that Cal Poly will look beyond
the Pitt match.

“We hope they take us lightly,”
he said. “If they take us as an ordi-
nary team, then we think we can
get them in trouble with that kind
of attitude."

Now that the team knows who
its opponent will be, where and
when it will play, practice sessions
this week will increase one step in
intensity, Collier said.

“This is the most classic team
I’ve ever coached." he continued.
“If we practice poorly, then we
play poorly. When practices are
going great, then we play very
well.”

Practices have not discouraged
Collier. Players are in top condi-
tion, trainingin differentaspects of
the game has been consistently
well-executed, and the attitude is

good.
Collier, though, still has to
upgrade team’s blocking and

defending against a quicker, fast-
paced and more deceptive offense
that the Cal Poly team successfully
uses. Serving is the No. 1 priority
for Collier; without aggressive
serves, the team can’t play
aggressively.

“We have not played against an
offense this quick,” Collier said.
“It is one with very quick sets that
doesn’t give us time to set ourselves
up. Sets are shorter and quicker."

The key factor to Pitt's success
against Cal Poly will be being pre-
pared, not so much because of Cal
Poly’s power-volleyball tradition,
but because of their home-court
advantage and the officials’
partiality.

Collier is aware of this notion.

“We could get intimidated and
get beaten badly,” he said. “But
we’re prepared and won’t let that
happen. This team is prepared for
what they will see at San Luis
Obispo."

One player who's prepared for
this tournament is setter Julie
Gaul. She was one of several others
on last year’s squad that defeated
Pepperdine and California-
Berkeley.

"The experience we gained in
those two wins was playing a team
better than us and beating them,"
she said. “The total psychology
this year is upset strategy...know-
ing you upset them before is my
major role on the team. It’s just
another experience to help."

Gaul and middle blocker Ulana
Kohutiak have both stressed the
importance of practicing and gear-
ing to meet Cal Poly’s strength.
Both realize the team has to
upgrade its skills in free-ball pass-
ing, defense, ball-control and
hitting.

“We’ve been psyching for a high
caliber team up till now.” Kohu-
tiak said. “Maybe that will increase
or decrease our chances of win-
ning. But it scares me, having so
little time knowing who our oppo-
nent will be.

“But you have to work with what
you've got. It sort of agitates me,
but if we complete our preset objec-
tives and stay together we might
pull it out. If we’re frightenedlittle
bunnies, then we will surely lose.”

Pat Belcher, a sophomore out-
side, says she is ready to play a
major role against Cal Poly as she
has against other teams during the
season.

“We’re looking for a major
upset, and to do this, we have to

9~Page 15

- Will Spikers Find Out What’s In A Name?

play the best game of our life." she
said. “We have nothing to lose."

Indeed, as Collier earlier said,
Pitt has done exceptionally well
going into matches with a
“nothing-to-lose attitude.” If Cal
Poly loses, he said, “it will proba-
bly be one of the biggest upsets in
collegiate volleyball history."

And with a team captain like
Gaul spurring the team on, could it
be that anything can happen this
weekend in San Luis Obispo?

“We are not intimidated by
anybody,” she said. “We can play
with anybody anyway. We may not
have the skills, but there is a team
cohesiveness.”

GAME SERVES: With 28 teams
playing this weekend in four
regional divisions, there is one bye
in each. In the first section, Hawaii
received a first round bye with
California-Santa Barbara playing
San Jose. Arizona State plays Illi-
nois State, and Pitt plays Cal Poly-
SLO.

Stanford gets a bye in its divi-
sion, North Carolina plays Univer-
sity of the Pacific, Arizona plays
Texas A 8: M, and Texas plays
Southwest Missouri. _

USC is the bve team in its divi-
sion. It’s Tennessee vs. Northwest-
ern, Nebraska vs. Penn State and
Purdue vs. Rutgers.

In the final section, San Diego
gets the bye while UCLA plays
Louisville, Brigham Young plays

Western Michigan, and California- .

Berkeley plays Pepperdine.

Lady Panthers Anxious To Even Score

By scorr DELLETT

Revenge will be on the minds of
the Pitt Lady Panthergbasketball
team members as they go against
Kent State tonight. Last year, the
Lady Golden Flashes, who made
the NCAA playoffs in 1981-82,
upset Pitt at the Fitzgerald Field
House 72-67.

“When Kent State upset us, that
made their season,” Coach Judy
Saurer said.

Saurer expects another difficult
game from Kent State, even though
they are winless in two games.

“They will come to play,” she
said. “They don’t like losing to Pitt
and they don’t want to be 0-3.”

Kent State will be missing sev-
eral key members from last year’s
team. Bonnie Boachy, who was the
Lady Golden flashes leading scorer
with a 20.2 point per game average,
has graduated while Nancy Beatty
was declared academically ineligi-
ble and Dawn Johns, the leading

rebounder last season, is out with a
knee injury. Boachy scored 17
points against Pitt last year while
Beatty added 14.

“Last year, they hustled against
us,” Saurer said. “Meanwhile, we
didn’t play well.”

“Kent State has two big physical
players inside while their guards
have game experience. I expect a
tough game up there. Kent State is
capable of winning.”

In the three Lady Panther wins
in 1982, there have been several
outstanding performances. Sopho-
more forward Jennifer Bruce has
picked up where she left off in
l98l-82. In the three games, Bruce
is averaging 23.7 points per game
while getting 10.7 rebounds a con-
test. She is also shooting 62.8 per-
cent from the floor.

Two freshmen have impressed
Saurer during the early part of this
season. Guard Kim . Gannis is
second on the Lady Panther squad
in scoring, averaging 13 points per

game while only playing 15 min-
utes per game. Meanwhile Kim
Tirik, who made the Big East pre-
season rookie team, leads Pitt in
assists with 18, accomplished in
just 48 minutes of play.

“Gannis has been a surprise,”
Saurer said. “If she can continue to
play like this, she will help us.

“Tirik has the confidence and
the ability to step right in.

“She has good court vision-
something a lead guard should
have. She also has good range on
her jump shot.”

A key to the Lady Panthers’ suc-
cess in the future will be in the
development of 6-3 freshman cen-
ter Pam George.

“Pam isn’t quite ready yet,”
Saurer said. “We have to work with
her.” -

One thing that helped Saurer in
the 93-39 rout of National College
lastSaturdaynightwasthe amount
of playing time she was able to give
the bench. All players received at

least 13 minutes.

“It’s great to give everyone play-,
ing time,” Saurer said. “It’s good
for morale. I feel comfortable
going to the bench this year.”

The team's statistics have also
been impressive. The Lady Pan-
thers are shooting 49 percent from
the floor while averaging 45
rebounds per contest—a nine-
rebound margin over their
opposition.

LADY PANTHER NOTES:
Freshman forward-center Cindy
Griffiths is out for two weeks with
a stress fracture to her foot.

Lisa Fubio, a 5-10 guard, has
transferred from Connecticut to

Pitt and will be eligiblevfor the _

1983-84 season. As a freshman at
Connecticut last year, Fubio led the
team in steals and was second in
assists and third in scoring with 10
points per game. She will have
three years of eligibility remaining.

Woodruff: Pitt’s Gold Medalist 

(Editor's note: This is the last of
a six-part series on former Pitt
greats. The exerpts have been taken
from “Hail to Pitt: A Sports His-
tory of the University of Pitts-
burgh,” edited by jim O'Brien and

“It was a real good feeling. I did
something as an athlete and for my
country.”

John Woodruff stared at Adolph
Hitler, not sure what he should do
next.

Woodruff, a freshman middle-
distance runner from the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, hadjustwon the
800—meter event in a most uncon-
ventional manner in the 1936
Olympic Games, and he was stand-
ing on the top perch of the winners’
platform.

Hitler, the chancellor and
Fuhrer of Nazi Germany, stood in
his private box at Berlin Stadium,
to acknowledge the presentation of
medals, as he did throughout the
Games.

Joseph Goebbels, the minister of
propaganda, approached the plat-
form. Woodruff lowered his head,
and Goebbels slipped the Olympic
gold medal about the tall young
man’s head.

“I was kinda confused," recalled
Woodruff while sitting in a room
at the Grand Hyatt in New York
City, in the winter of 1982, 46 years
later, and reminiscing about his
athletic accomplishments at Pitt.
“They didn't school us as to how
we were supposed to respond.

“They started to play the Star
Spangled Banner, and I didn’t
know whether to give Hitler the
Nazi salute or the American salute.
I went through three or four gyra—
tions before I put my hand above
my right eye, and saluted him in an
American manner."

Woodruff was sure of one thing.
“It was a real good feeling," he
reflected on his experience as a 21-
year—old Olympic gold medalist.
“It was a very inspirational feeling.
I did something as an athlete and
for my country."

What Woodruff did was some-
thing special. To this day he is the
only student in the history of the
University of Pittsburgh, or athlete
from Western Pennsylvania, to win
an Olympic championship. “Long
John" is justly proud.

The 1936 Olympic Games in
Berlin were dominated by Adolph
Hitler and J.C. Owens, who
became popularly. known as Jesse
Owens, a spindly sprinter from
Ohio State University who won
four gold medals.

 

 

 

Owens finished first in the 100-
and 200-meter sprints, anchored
the 400-meter U.S.A. team to vic-
tory, and won the broadjump, now
known as the long jump.

Owens was black, and his success
in the Xlth Games was supposed to
have been a jolt to Hitler's theory of
Aryan supremacy. In one report of
those games, it was written that
“the Nazi government disgracefuly
attempted to turn the Olympic
movement into a propaganda vehi-
cle for the glorification of their
creed."

Woodruff, who is also black, says
he was unaware of the political
implications back then, and
believes the American athletes were
just as naive, including Jesse
Owens.

“You could see all those flags
with the swastikas about the sta-
dium, but they didn’t mean the
same thing to us then that they do
now,” said Woodruff. “You could
see the German soldiers marching
around. It was impressive.

“The treatment was superb.
Everything was fine. They couldn’t
have treated us any better. Old-
timers on our Olympic team said
the facilities were the finest they
had ever experienced. Everything
was just right.

“A young German athlete came
to our village. He spoke some Eng-
lish. We asked him about Hitler,
and he made a statement that
Hitler was doing a fine job, that he
had improved the economy, and
had people working again.

“We knew nothing then about
his Aryan supremacy theories, that
pure—blooded whites were to rule
the earth. If he was advancing all
this political stuff, we weren’t con-
scious of it.

“Hitler came to the Games every
day, and sat in his box with his
lieutenants. We didn’t pay much
attention to him. I know Jesse
Uweﬁs always tala the staty éiB6‘tii
Hitler refusing to shake his hand.
He said he snubbed him. I don’t
know about that. Hitler and Jesse
exchanged waves, I know that. I
saw that.

“One day Hitler invited some
American athletes to his box. Jesse
wasn’t one of them because he was
busy competing in events. So I
don't know when the opportunity
came up for Hitler to snub him.”

There were more than 110,000
spectators who witnessed Wood-
ruff’s winning effort in the 800-
meter run that overcast and
otherwise gray day of Aug. 4,‘ 1936.

Owens won his second gold
medal that same day with an Olym-
pic record broad jump of 26 feet, 5
inches, but Woodruff’s victory was
more unexpected and certainly
more unorthodox.

The race was run in bad weather
conditions, the pace was slow and
Woodruff’s winning time of 1:529
didn’t threaten any existing marks.
It was still remarkable.

“Winning the race itself, and
how I won it,” said Woodruff, “is
still vivid in my mind, and always
will be. In the preliminaries whenl
ran, Ijumped rightout in front and
stayed there. I did the same thing in
the semi-final heat. Why I ran the
way I did in the finals still escapes
me.

“I laid back in the beginning.
Phil Edwards, a Canadian who
went to NYU, set the pace. He set a
slow pace. I fell in behind, and ran
second or third. I ran that way for
400 meters. Then I realized that all
the field was around me, and I was
boxed in. I had to get out of there.”

What Woodruff did next was
recounted thusly by Olympic his-
torian R.D. Mandel]:

“Seemingly disgusted, the Amer-
ican giant slowed his pace until he
was, briefly, walking."

Recalls Woodruff:

“I actually stopped. I got spiked,
but I didn't realize it until Isaw the
blood on my leg after the race. I
moved out into the third lane, and
was last in the pack. I felt I had to
do something drastic. I couldn’t
break between the two leaders
because I would’ve been disquali-
fied on a foul.

“From the third lane, I got
around everybody, and took the
lead. They said I ran a lot more
than 800 meters."

Woodruff was able to make up
the lost ground because he had a
running stride that hadn’t been
seen before in track and field com-
petition. The average athlete took
in about eight feet at a stride,_while
Woodruff was believed to be out-
ting his spikes up and down nine
feet apart.

The 6-3, l68—pound freshman
had what was described as “the
longest stride of any human being
in the world,” and, in another
report, as “heron—legged.”

“At Pitt, I reached the ultimate
right from the beginning, but I
enjoyed the rest of my student days,
too. It was stimulating,” Woodruff
went on. “I got more experience,
and I accomplished a lot of the
goals that were set for me.”

He won the 440 and 880 three
years in succession in the IC4A
track and field championships.
“That had never been done before
in 58 years,” he said. During the
same three year span, from 1937
throgh 1939, he also won the
NCAA half-mile all three years.
“That was quite an achievement,"
he said. “You can’t do much better
than that.”

He also set records and anchored
record—setting Pitt relay teams at
the Penn Relays in Philadelpha,
and at various meets in Madison
Square Garden. He won the 800
meters in the 1937 Pan American
Games.

,He recalled his relationship with
Carl Olson, the Pitt track coach. It
was a satisfying, yet stormy rela-
tionship. “Coach Olson was a very
ambitious coach,” he said. “He
tried to get the ultimate out of you.
But he had a tendency to make you
run too much.

“I often ran in four events: the
220, 440, 880 and the mile,” said
Woodruff. “I didn’t mind it so
much in dual meets. But in the
IC4A and NCAA, I felt you were
fortunate if you could win one
event. I remember in 1938 at the
University of Minnesota, he
wanted me to run the quarter- and
half-mile events, and I had to run
heats as well as to qualify for the
finals. He got mad at me when I
protested. He was like a little dicta-
tor, a Napoleon. I just thought it
was too much to ask in a national
competition.” A

Woodruff ran and won, though,
and Pitt won its share of IC4A
titles, and gained a national repu-
tation as one of the top teams in the
nation in those days.

In 1937, for instance, Woodruff
established a world mark of l:47.8
for the half-mile as Pitt won the
IC4A title. That same campaign.
he won the same event in the
NCAA meet held in Berkeley,
Calif., with a l:50.3 clocking.

On Friday, April 30, 1938, at the
44th Penn Relays Carnival in Phi-
ladelphia, Woodruff made up a
deficit to anchor Pitt’s sprint med-
ley unit (Frank ()hl, Al Ferrara and
Dick Mason) to a world record
3:315 time, as he ran the 880 in
1919.9. The following day, he
anchored the half-mile relay team
(the same foursome) to victory, and
then the~mile unit (Allen “Red"
McKee replaced Mason on the third
slot) to victory. On May 27 of the
same summer, Woodruff won the
—l*l() and 880 in the I(I~lA track and
field meet, equaling the college
mark of 47 seconds for the 440.

In his senior season of 1939, he
repeated his IC4A and NCAA titles,

 

and anchored three winning relay
teams at the Penn Relays. The Pitt
teams on which he ran, and he cap-
tained the l939 outfit, were unde-
feated in dual meets.

In 1936, Woodruff was named a
Varsity Letterman of Distinction at
Pitt, inducted along with Allan
Booth, Charles Hartwig and Regis
Toomey. To Woodruff’s way of
thinking, he wondered what took
so long.

“I was hurt before that," said
‘Woodruff. “I was the only Olym-
pic champion in the history of the
school, yet I was not in Pitt's Hall
of Fame in the school yearbook.
People like Marshall Goldberg,
Curly Stebbins
Chickerneo——all classmates of
mine—were in, but Iwasn’t. Those
guys brought national recognition
to Pitt. I brought the school inter-
national recognition."

Woodruff had some second
thoughts on the subject. “I do not
have any more bitterness concern-
ing my college days at Pitt,” he
added. “I have put all those
unpleasant experiences behind me.
I now want to help and encourage
some young promising black
athletes to enter Pitt.”

In 1978, Woodruff was elected
into the National Track and Field
Hall of Fame. As he spoke that
afternoon in New York, he pointed

proudly to the large gold ring he
wore that acknowledged his admis-
sion into that hallowed group.

Woodruff was wearing that same
prized ring when Pitt paid tribute
to him in May of 1982 at the Pitt
Invitational Track and Field Meet
which attracted 25 college teams to
Pitt Stadium.

He presented a plaque to the
winner of the “Job n Woodruff 880-
yard run,” an idea fostered by his
friend, another former Pitt Olym-
pic medal winner, Herb Douglas.
“john deserves something like
this," declared Douglas.

“I haven't been forgotten,” said
Woodruff. “When the Olympics
were held in Munich in 1972, Ger-
man officials made arrangements
for the 1936 Olympic champions to
be there, and they paid my way.

“We were given a tour of Berlin.
We saw the Berlin Wall, and we
heard the Berlin Symphony
Orchestra—I_ appreciated that——
and we went to the stadium where
I’d run in 1936. I’m looking out at
the empty stadium, and I had a
quick flash. Suddenly, I could see
all those flags, and the soldiers
marching, and I could imagine all
those people. For a second, there
were over a hundred thousand peo-
ple in the place again, and I was
running. It was like it was
yesterday."

Panthers-
Defeat

Dukes

r‘r)ntz'nued from page thirteen

Searles hurt us bad in the first
half." Chipman said. “It was the
best I've seen him play."

Duquesne came within two
points in the middle of the second
half due to sloppy play by the
Panthers. In a two minute stretch,
Pitt threw away one pass, traveled
and missed on a one—and—one
situation.

Dwayne Rawls‘ foul shot, a short
baseline jumper by Searles and two
more free throws by Rawls cut the
lead to two.

Two freshman mistakes by
Rawls brought the Panther lead
back to six. Andre Williams missed
the first half of a one—and-one, but
Rawls stepped into the lane early,
giving Williams a second chance.
He converted both shots. A minute
later, Vaughan drove down the
land, and Rawls blocked his layup
for a goaltending call.

The Panthers finally put the
game to rest in the last two min-
utes. After Searles layup, Chip
Watkins and Vaughan hit consecu-
tive five foot jumpers, and Willi-
ams put in two free throws, icing
the game for Pitt.

There were several reasons for
the Panthers’ performance in the
second half. Stronger offensive
rebounding, outside shooting by
the Pitt guards which enabled
Vaughan to get open inside a lack
of endurance by Duquesne gave the
Panthers the victory.

“They got a lot of second shots
near the end,” Satalin said. “That
was because of fatigue. Teachout
and Myers missed a couple of shots
near the end, and I think they were
tired at the end of the game.”

“In the first half, there were three
guys on me," Vaughan, who scored
20 of his 26 points in the second
half, said. “In the second half, we
adjusted. If they were going to sag
on me, then the guards wouldtake
the outside shot. When George
Allen hit the shots, it cleared the
inside up."

Vaughan wasn’t supposed to
play last night. A deep back bruise,
suffered in practice Monday,
almost kept him out of action.

“I didn’t think he would play
tonight,” Chipman said. “If I sat
him down, I knew he wouldn’t be
able to get up and play again.”

“He is just a great player,”
Satalin said. “Pitt goes as far as he
does. In the first half, he was just
one of five guys out there.”

But Pitt needs to improve in
order to face the stiff competition
of the Big East.

about where the two teams are ,AttOI'neyS at Law

IIOVV .

“It's good that both schools are AppOlntrT]entS AVallable in DOWntOWn,
in different leagues,” he said.

    
     
      
  

She“? W ‘hat hatred “'61- locations days, evenings and Saturdays.
Tonight, though, there were com- x 7

pliments from both sides, people
helping others up from the floor.
(Pitt) played a clean, classy game."

P P P
Sisinni would like to play Pitt
twice a season. Now, he said, Pitt
has “bragging rights” all year, and
it’s cause for letdown. .

Senior Joey Myers, Duquesne’s
6-8 center, marvelled over last

night’s intense and hardly fought 3  6  A 0 l d
game. “We were psyched to play  j a 
tonight,” he said, “but there wer-
en’t as many fans (total attendance

reached 7,980). Because of that, it p 0

isn’t really good; at least not as

good as when there used to be the
Bruce (Atkins) versus (Sam) Clancy
matchups.

Sophomore center Dave Udanis
also thinks the fans make a key dif-
ference. “Whenever we play Pitt,”
he explained, “the fans matter. It is

always, always, an aggressive game
when playing Pitt. And I’d like to
play them twice...for bragging
rights.”

This is undoubtedly what Pitt
coach Roy Chipman had in mind
when making up last evening’s
starting lineup card.

“I did not think he would play
tonight," Chipman said of
Vaughan. “If I sat him down, I
knew he wouldn’t be able to get up
and plqy again.”

Jim Satalin, in his first year as
Duquesne’s coach, believes that the
rivalry was as evident last night as
before, but cleancut this time
around.

“I didn’t think it was a nine
point game,” he said. “It was a
three-four point game really and a
good exciting game for the fans.
There were no cheap shots, no
mouthing to anyone; it was a col-
lege game played the way it should
be played.”

Different conferences or not, the
rivalry still exists in Pitt and
Duquesne sectors. Traditions die
hard. After all, this is whatcity bas-
ketball fans thrive on and stand
loyally by—The Duquesne Dukes
against the Pitt Panthers.
