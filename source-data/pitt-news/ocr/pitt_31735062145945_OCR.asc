Manager Lytron A. MSclMiolppgMhaMs al-
ready made it known‘ that "there will
be a Freshman contest.‘ likely double,

" early in Februaryon the‘subje(M:Mt,- “Re-
solved, that America should enter the

League of Nations as at present con-
stituted.” He has requested. that all
those . interested. attend ‘ tomo'rrow’sV.
meeting.‘ In ‘addition, a varsity de-
bate has been arranged‘ with Colgate
University on the question of there-
peal or the amendmentof thepresent
three per cent immigration law. : This“
debate will take place in Pittsburgh.

Various interesting. possibilities‘ for
discussion have been brought up by

the - novel .foMMrensiMc  methods ‘ which M.

have been introduced in th-e“'Un‘ited
States by the English teams sent over
in -the last «few‘years from. Oxford.

. The BMr.iMtish 9 debate ‘McustomsM[ differ

radically from ,Mthe ‘traditional meth-
ods of‘ ,Americanf'schools,_ being out-
growths of "the rulesof the Oxford
Union, a parliamentary disMcussionV
body. A It has been ,the"'effort of the
British teamsto eliminate all details
which contribute to the spirit of co‘nM-_‘
test,M_such as teamwork,M_rebuttals‘, lim-
ited time, and judges, ‘since. these are’
thoMlMlghtM by them to destroy“Ma1Ml pos-
sibi'lity.‘o_f impartial search for‘__ truth.
Several American schools. have taken
up ‘this M‘idea and as a. consMequenceM
proposals have been received. by the
Association for the elimination oi:
judges, sMubMstitu_ting the vote of the
audience, and for the “splitting” of

-teams by having one member, of Mo_MneM

school, work and speak with the mem-
bers ‘of another school ‘against a.‘ ‘sec-
ond. team which is organized in “the.
opposite pMropMor'tion. MNeither‘systei:n
seems to have -such advantages over
the other as to render‘ a. decision be-‘
tween tliem easy,M_Mso that ample room
‘remains for discussion. ’ ‘
