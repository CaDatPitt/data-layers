A bill that would permit
19-year-olds in Pennsylvania to
purchase and consume alcoholic
beverages appears headed toward
passage by the state legislature,
possibly by mid-November, accord-
ing to Student Government Board
member Stan Galanski.

The bill (SB-252) passed the
Senate June 8th byia vote of 27-21
and is now in the Liquor Control
Committee of the House. Both
Houses have recessed until
September.

Galanski said some legislators
would be reluctant to pass the bill
before the November elections for
fear of alienating constituents.

After the summer recess the bill
will be debated on the House floor
and possibly followed bv a fina.l vote.
If the House votes against the bill it
will either return to committee or
back to the Senate to be
reconsidered.

Delays, Breakdowns Fail-To

Thousands of Pitteburghere braved humid temperatures last weekend to celebrate the Three Rivers Regatta at Point
State Park. The festivities ended Sunday with a‘ eternwheeier race that-despite delays and technical problems-was the

\r-'1,

in the House could be quite close. A
similar bill was defeated by the
House .95-94 in 1973 (102 affirmative
votes are necessary for passage).

“There is still a little bit of mixed
fear or hesitation,” Galanski said,
but added that no particular group
(Democrats, Republicans, Blacks) is
strongly opposed to the bill.
“Opponents come from diverse
segments. It’s really amazing.”

Representatives who have signi-
ﬁed approval of the bill in the past
will schedule a Harrisburg press
conference _.with students from
various colleges and universities
throughout the state to discuss
advantages of the bill. Members of
the Governmental and Public
Relations Committee of Student
Government will be present, said
Galanski, and student lobbying in
Harrisburg which was‘initiated last
fall will continue. At least ten trips to
the stategcapital were planned, he
claimed, averaging out to about one
trip every month.

These “man-made potholes” ‘have made the Fifth Avenue trek
through Oakland a bit slower lately. They are actually repairs under-
taken by Equitable Gas Company for.a gas line which travels from the
Cathedral to the vicinityrot McKee Place. Officials predict the work will
be completed within two weeks.

Kathy Stevens, responding to
criticism from Pitt Union Program
Council (PUPC) chairman Tammy
Haddad, said the School of General
Studies (SGS) student cabinet may
be capable of providing “limited”
funding for the Council this year.

“We told her (Haddad) that we
do have limited funds,” the night

‘ studies student cabinet president
said in an interview Monday. “But
there is still the possibility that we
will fund the PUPC.”

Haddad had stated last week that
while the PUPC had received
$110,000 from the SGB (annually for
three years) and $40,000 from the
Office of Student Activities, no
money had been allocated from the
SGS student cabinet, even though
programming is available to night
students. Stevens countered that
with an SGS budget of $75,000, any
funding would indeed be limited.

PITTSBURGH—A crane operatorx whose
cousin has filed suit to obtain bone marrow for
a life-saving transplant isn’t obligated to
donate part of his body, his lawyer said
yesterday.

f‘The law of Pennsylvania says there is no
legal duty to provide a transplant even if he,
the donor, is assuming no risk,” attorney John
Studeny told an Allegheny County Common
Pleas Court iudize.

David Shimp, 43, was named Monday in a
lawsuit filed by his cousin Robert McFall, 39,
who is dying of aplastic anemia, a disease that
blocks bone marrow formation of new blood
cells.

A doctor testiﬁed that McFall’s chances of
living a year without borrowed bone marrow
are less than 25 percent. Chemical treatment
can improve his chances, but a transplant is
preferred, hesaid.

“It’s rare for a complete recovery if no
transplant or chemical treatment is per-

Dampen Regatta

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH

Pitt News Staff Writer

Captain Gene Fitch gave it a good try, but in the end the Claire E just
couldn’t beat his opponent, the Winnifred. However, no one aboard the
Claire _E seemed to be disappointed that the boat lost the Great
Sternwheeler Race at the Pittsburgh Three River Regatta Sunday.

Everyone on Fitch’s sternwheeler, which he has renovated into a
houseboat, was more interested in soaking up the sun and experiencing
the novelty of a ride on a genuine piece of Americana.

The entire race started with a bit of confusion. As the sternwheeiers
waited for instructions at the tip of Bruno Island, the starting point of the
event, a Regatta Official asked over the radio,» “Any word from the Race
Committee about what’s going on down there (at the point)?”

Other inconveniences slowed the start of the race. The sternwheeiers
had to clear the channel to let two loaded barges make their way down
the Ohio. Coast Guard boats plied the race course, clearing pleasure
boats from the path of the sternwheelers. «

One casualty never even made it to the starting line. The E.L.

Thumper, winner of the 1977 Marietta Sternwheeler Race, smashed six
of the buckets (planks) on its sternwheel in shallow water and could not
race.

After delays, the first heat finally got underway with the Clair E facing
the Crain Brothers sternwheeler, Miss Sterling. As planned, the two
boats stayed neck and neck until the point and then sprinted for the
Smithﬁeld Street Bridge. The Miss Sterling—-a bad luck boat with three’
sinkings in its history—just didn’t have the power, and the Claire E won
by a length with cheers of “Gol“Gol Go!” from County Commissioner
Jim Flaherty’s children, special guests aboard Fitch’s boat.

formed,” said Dr. Louis Pietragallo. “But

there is some chance of indeﬁnite survival.”
A transplant would increase the chance of

survival to 40 to 60 percent, the doctor said.

Preliminary medical tests show McFall, an
insulation worker, is compatible with Shimp.
Other relatives have been screened without
locating a suitable donor.

Shimp has declined to take a second test to
confirm compatibility. The suit‘ asks the court
to order testing and direct Shimp to provide
marrow if his bone marrow proves acceptable.

“My client would have great risk of harm if
he underwent the procedure,” Studeny told
the court.

‘ ‘There could be risks and there definitely are
inconveniences,” he added at another point
during the proceedings.

McFall’s attorney urged Judge John P.
Flaherty to follow English law, which permits
court-ordered transplants, and introduced
evidence to show that the risks to Shimp are not
great.

“The minor procedure will, at most, result in
minor and temporary discomfort,” attorney
John Murtagh Jr. said in a brief. “It won’t
deprive the donor of anything other than his
time.”

The transplant requires about 100 to 150
bone punctures, said Pietragallo. Doctors
would use a special curved needle to pierce the
pelvis and extract the marrow.

‘ ‘It’s not a complex procedure, and the risks
in this area are extremely narrow,” he said.
‘ ‘The patient is discharged a day or so after the
transplant is done, so it's hard to talk about it
as a major operation.”

Pittsburgh hospitals are not equipped to
carry out the rare operation. Pietragallo said it
would be performed elsewhere. McFall was
hospitalized in June with a nose bleed and
doctors discovered his illness. They believe he
may have contracted the disease in his job ‘as an
insulation worker.

Publicity about McFall’s illness has resulted
in a number of offers from donors, a Mercy
Hospital spokesman said.

SGS President Claims Funding
‘Limited’ For Program Council

(Continued from Page Q

Haddad and Jack Brown, assis-
tant director of student activities,
had attended a June 28 meeting of
the SGS student cabinet where
Stevens said she suggested that
SGS provide student participation
rather than money for the Council.

“If it’s support they want, I don't
see any problems,” Stevens said.
“But at this time, I cannot see any
sizable amount of money to be
contributed to the Council.”

Stevens said that at the meeting
Brown and Haddad gave no
indication as to the amount of
money expected from the SGS
student cabinet. Stevens recalled
asking Haddad to suggest a ﬁgure.
“Whatever you wish,” was

Haddad’s response, according to
Stevens. She said that no ﬁgure or
amount was ever suggested by
either Haddad or Brown.

Haddad also claimed last week
that the SGS has attempted
programming in the past, but
always exclusively for night stu-
dents.

SGS programs are “not really
open to day students,” Stevens
explains. “That’s because of our
limited funding. We have a social
committee to which $13,000 is
allocated in addition to $1,000 for
advertising.’ ’ \

Haddad also said that the night
students were “becoming apart”
from the University in not becoming

involved with the PUPC. Stevens
said Haddad handed out applica-
tions for committee involvement at
the June 28 meeting, but Stevens
has thus far failed to return any.

“She gave us applications but we
have not gotten around to getting
them back to Tammy yet, ’ ’ she said.
One night student involved in the
PUPC is Social Interest Committee
Chairman Debbie Alpert, whom
Stevens defeated last winter for the
top position at SGS student cabinet.

Stevens expressed hope that the
SGS position on funding would
become more concrete in the future,
and added that for now, all the
cabinet could provide was inter-
ested night students.

Regatta E perience Highlighted
At Sunday Sternwheeler Race

(Continued from Page I) L

In the ﬁnalrun-off, The Clair E
faced the Winnifred, captained by
Clyde Bryant, an Allegheny Air-
lines pilot. Mayor Richard
Caliguiri’s young son, Greg,
predicted the race as well as Jimmy
the Greek could have “I think
we’re going to win for a while, then
we’re going to lose,” he prophe-
sized.

With a one-quarter mile head
start, the Claire E didn’t have a
chance against the Winnefred,
which had twice the power of the

150 horsepower diesel engine on the
losing sternwheeler.

The desparate paddling by one
crewman at the bow and the urgings
of the passengers could not help the
slower boat. In the end, the Claire E
trailed far behind the winner.

After the loss, Captain Fitch ran
into a little more poor luck. The

strain of the two races overheated‘

his engine, and he had to tie to shore
and wait for it tovcool.

It began to rain, and Fitch’s

guests, including Mrs. Caliguiri

Pitt News Staff Writer

When artiﬁcial playing surfaces were
introduced to football more than 10 years
ago, two facets of the game quickly came to
the fore—-speed and injuries. Increased
speed served to revolutionize the game's
offensive and defensive techniques, while
any team that could not escape a rash of
injuries was certain to stumble in its quest
for the lucrative spoils offered in
post-season play.

Dr. Joseph Doller, former trainer for the
Chicago Cardinals of the National Football
League (NFL), has one of the most common
injuries that has been caused by the
artiﬁcial surfaces—“turf toe.” Although
doctors maintain turf toe does not prohibit
an athlete from participating in workouts,
the pain is sufficient to interfere with the
players’ performance, and trainers have yet
to come up with a treatment to relieve the
symptoms.

    A.lma.i 1.i...r.....;.. .,
Wilson phot

Doller stated that the injury is either
caused by alternating play on natural and
artiﬁcial surfaces, or by much of the
inadequate footwear that is on today's
market.

Turf toe will most likely occur with
running backs, wide receivers and
quarterbacks and will develop after an
athlete abandons one type of playing
surface for another. If a player, who has
developed the injury, is able to play on the
same surface for three to four weeks, the
pain will diminish, but since every carpet
(even those made by the same manufac-
turer) varies in some way this adaptation
rarely occurs.

In an effort to give the runner as much
traction as possible, shoe manufacturers
have created a product that causes
excessive gripping on dry turf and much
slipping on wet turf. When either of these
conditions exist, the ankle and foot are
more susceptable to injury.

‘‘If the shoe will not give and the impetus
of the runner will not allow him to stop
instantly, the foot will slide forward and
into the tip of the shoe,” Doller said. “A
few repeated incidents of this nature create
an environment for turf toe.”

Doller maintains that the manufacturers
have produced a kind of “overkill” by
equipping artiﬁcial turf shoes with cleats. A

 shoe designed along the lines of the models
‘ used by basketball and tennis players
x would likely provide sufﬁcient traction and

lessen the‘ potential for overkill.

The traction generated by the cleated
shoe when worn on artificial surfaces
causes an impact of the great (big) toe

» against the toe box of the shoe whenever

the player stops, cuts or slides on the turf.
Within hours, this syndrome has made its
presence felt.

Doller recommends a shoe that would
offer more rigidity, more ﬁrmness in the toe
box and a more natural cupping
arrangement in the heel seat.

“A thorough research program to
develop a shoe to accommodate the great
number of athletes is necessary to combat
this condition,” Doller said.

In addition to advances in shoe manufac-
turing, Doller -believes that exercise
programs and ‘running techniques could be
changed to give the joints of the foot

greater mobility and decrease the chance of

Trainers from the NFL and several major
colleges agree on the causes for the injury,
but no one has yet come up with a set of
treatments to get the player back in playing

condition. Some trainers use ice- on the
injury, while pthers prefer a combination of
hot and cold baths. All agree, however,
that no prescription has eliminated the
problem. . .
‘ “Turf toe is a very real and viable
problem; one which must be studied,”
Doller said. “The problem will increase
instead of diminish unless proper steps are
taken.” '0

Successfully conquering nagging injuries
such as turf toe would do more to increase
the quality of competition and the fans’
enjoyment of the game than any of the rule
changes that result from the annual league
owners’ meeting.
