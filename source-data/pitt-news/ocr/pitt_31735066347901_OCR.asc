.. Labor Crowd, Stevens Clash  

By BETSY NORMAN

r~.Representatives for the J .P.
Stevens company and the Amal-
gamated Clothing and Textile
Workers Union (ACTWU) spoke
before a decidedly pro-union
audience at a public discussion of
the boycott recently waged against
the southern-based textile manu-
facturer.

The boycott movement, headed
by AFL-CIO President George
Meany, was launched late last year
in an. effort to get the Stevens
company to abide by the National

Labor Relations Act. The Stevens_

Company has been convicted of
violating this act 15 times, along
with various other occupational
health and safety acts. G

The ACTWU speakers stated
Stevens paid its workers $1.26 cents
per hour less than the national
factory workers average salary and
further that cotton dust levels in
some of Stevens’ 85 plants were as
much as 12 times the levels
permissible under law.

Franklin denied the charges and
claimed Stevens does not “know-
ingly violate the law or discriminate

The conference committee bud-

Pitt's funding could not be
ascertained last night.

“Dracula’
burgh.

Actually, in Geoffry Hit‘ch’s
production now showing at the
Allegheny Community Theatre, the
vampire has come to Londonfrom
Transylvania. This horriﬁes real
estate broker’ Jonathan’ Harker,
who closed ‘a London property” sale
for Dracula before he suspected
what he was.

has ‘come to Pitts-

Once he reaches London, Dra-
cula (Christopher Fay) affects‘ a
dozen other lives besides the real
estate broker’s, His purpose for
coming, of course, is the abund-
ance of victims in the city. His new
home is next door to an insane
asylum run by Dr. John Seward
and one of the
Vampire's ﬁrst London victims is
Lucy Westenre (Diane vHeles),
whose hand Dr. Seward sought» in
marriage. Lucy's best friend‘, Mina
Murray (Barbara Knowles) is
engaged to Jonathan Harker

(Nathaniel Ritch), who returns
from Transylvania in shock from
what he experienced at Castle
Dracula.

As the macabre tale unfolds, Dr.
Seward calls on Professor Van
Helsing (Ian Schneiderman) to
discover the nature of the creature
who has appeared. It is Van
Helsing who convinces Dr. Seward
and the others that Dracula is a
vampire. But he was not the first in
London to know. Renﬁeld, a
patient at the asylum who eats ﬂies
and spiders,_ has gradually come
under the power of Dracula,
against his own will, and. assists
him in attacking his victims.

Playwright Hitch does not
succumb to the limitations of the
stage by paring down Bram
Stoker’s 1897 classic totwo or three
scenes. He takes a sweeping
approach to the story and moves it
from a lonely country road in
Transylvania to Castle Dracula to
various places in London and back
to Transylvania.

To illustrate this sweeping
approach, Hitch uses every part of
the theatre with the action taking
place around and above the
audience. Area lighting and
spotlights continually. focus and
blacken out to change scenes and
rarely is the whole stage lit up. The
technique works well, because the
dimness adds to the play’s sinister
atmosphere.

The mood for the story is set at
the very beginning with Bela
Bartok"sbackground music. Hitch
utilizes sound effects (wolves, rats,
waves), a slideprojector and very
simple but suggestive props to
create his scenes. He has
succeeded in relating in a ﬂuid way
a story that could be cumbersome.
for someone with less imagination.

Nader After Myslinski? Maybe

By DAVID J. McDONALD

W_ASHINGTON——It’s possible

~ that Cas Myslinski, Art Rooney and

their fellow big time sports
executives are next on Ralph
Nader’s list. Nader, best known for
his attacks on the auto and airline
industries, may turn his attention
toward the multi-million dollar
sports industry.

Nader is advocating a larger role
for fans in the sports industry.

. Naderfis advocating a larger role
for fans in the sports arena.’ He
wants to help sports consumers
defend their interests.

That could spell trouble for
Myslinski and other athletic direc-
tors, since one of Nader’s main
targets is season ticket practices.
His Raiders will attempt to discover
if "and how average longtime ticket
holders are “shoved” from good
seats by more affluent, politically
connected fans. _

“We’ll also be looking into
spiraling ticket prices, ’ ’ Nader said.

‘ ‘along withhigh priced junk foodat
the concessionstands, TV blackouts
and player abuses such as violent
ﬁghts.” ‘

' Nader, with an eye on the
relationship of sports and televi-
sion, also said he would like to see
the abolition of phony “winner take
all” contests, “staged” promotions
(such as those connected with
boxing), the overextension and
overlapping or sports schedules and
special tax and antitrust favors
enjoyed by owners.

Sports fans should be repre-
sented during bargaining concem-
ing league. rule changes or,
expansion policies, according to
Nader. “Fans might have some
good ideas to suggest, along with
comments on proposals,” Nader
said.

Nader’s concern extends beyond
professional sports owners and
leagues. He also would like to see
fan participation in NCAA activi-
ties. _

Kaspar
Directed by David Miller

“I want to be a person, like
somebody else was once.” This is
the starting point of Peter Handke’s
play “Kaspar” now being perform-
ed by the Pittsburgh Laboratory
Theatre until July 28.

Directed and designed by David
Miller, the play’s theme seems to be
traditional, interesting and even
noble. It is not. The actors try their
best but cannot make up for the
play’s weaknesses.

Historically, Kaspar, whose last
name is Hauser, was said to have
been kept from 1812 on, in an unlit’
room with a ceiling no higher than
himself. As a result, he is supposed
to have learned to speak late in life.

This is not information you would
get from the play unless you were
familiar with it. In fact, you are not

I likely to get much of anything from it
except a worn-out ear.

Kaspar (Jodie McClintock) ap-
pears in the beginning, reciting the
above quotation over and over until
it is nearly meaningless. The

SPECIAI PACKAGE

Come to either Puccini location and ask for _the
Special Package. You’ll receive a shampoo, cut and

question is, “Can Kaspar, the
owner of one sentence begin to do
something with it?” Regardless of
the answer, hereceives the help of
some prompters (Trish Beatty,
Kathy Fitzpatrick, Nardi Novak,
Barb Witney), who tell Kaspar the
importance of this sentence and its
potential for other sentences. In this
manner Kaspar learns to speak.

Fact-sentences, nonsense-sen-
tences, realistic-sentences are con-
tinuously thrown at Kaspar by
different voices. ‘ ‘You can only -say
what you think! Think what you are
saying! Say what you think!”
Language is used not to “order’ ’ but
as Kaspar’s lead to the dilemma of
language, and the easy trap of
cliches.

It’s not a traditional play in any
sense of the word and it also has
nothing new to offer. Its-remindful,
in a way, of Gertrude Stein's famous .
remark, “A rose is a rose is a rose,”
to which Ernest Hemingway
replied, “A rose is‘ a rose is an
onion.” _

All this play proves is that if you

says a sentence at the same time,
then your sentence will not be heard.
