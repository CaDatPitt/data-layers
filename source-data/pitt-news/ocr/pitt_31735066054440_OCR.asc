A Port Authority bus struck a
Pitt student Monday as he attempted
to cross Fifth Avenue in front" of the
driveway of the William Pitt Union.

The incident took place just
before noon when, according to Pitt
Police Commander Tim Delaney,
the victim was heading for classes
at Thaw Hall."

A Penske truck driver pulled
over immediately after witnessing
the accident and tried to stop traffic
andtaid the victim. Passengers on
the bus and other witnesses also
wanted to help the victim, but were
fearful of risking spinal injury by
moving him.

Paramedics rushed the victim to
UPMC Presbyterian where he was
treated for minor abrasions to his
face and hands and a possible bro-
ken nose. He was treated and
released, according to Pitt
Spokesman Ken Service. ‘

Two more incidents were
reported over the weekend, raising
the total to four students who have

It's new policy of
banning alcohol in ‘three dorms. They live on the fourth ﬂoor oi now-dry Tower B.

For The Pltt News

As part of an effort to decrease
alcohol consumption on campus, a
University committee has designat-
ed three residence halls as alcohol-
free and has begun to offer awards
to students who avoid alcohol
abuse. -

Towers Aand B and Amos Hall
have been designated as alcohol-

free residential quarters, according-
to Dr. Steve. Sivulich, chairmansof I
the Residential Li’ving-Committee.  V

he said the University is trying to
prevent problems from arising in the

- future.

Pitt’s urban locationenables stu-
dents to drink in local bars rather
than on campus. Supermarkets and
convenience stores do not "sell alco-
holic beverages‘, making it more dif-
ficult to obtain liquor to bring onto
campus. \ ,

Part . of the residential living
committee’s objective is to increase
the number and variety of activities
for resident students. Sivulich said
the committee will concentrate. on
activities promoting a residential
life free from disturbances associat-
‘ed with drinking; such as noise, van-
dalism and physical altercations. H

Determined to get their point
across in a peaceful manner, anti-abor-
tion activists took to the streets in
silent protest Sunday afternoon.

Protesters walked along Oakland

streets, between Bellefield and».

Morewood Avenues, holding signs that
read, “Abortion Kills Children” and
“Adoption: Loving Option.” The
demonstration was part of a national
event, “Life Chain,” held annually.
 According to Helen Cindrich,
executive director of the Pittsburgh
 of People Concerned for the
Uiiborn Child in, Life Chain began in
October 1990. .

“It started in Bakersﬁeld, Ca., as a
grassroots, peaceful way to get people
to take one step out of the pew and

"13rayerfully witness for life,”

  
 

 ‘Life ‘Chain organizers issued a
code of conduct for participants to
abide by. Protestors were asked to give
immediate passage to’ ‘all pedestrians,
stand back from the street, not extend
signs beyond the curb and not hold up
traffic. Event organizers also said they
asked participants to be humble and
maintain the Christian spirit of love
and helping others.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (U —WIRE) —
As more college applicants become farnil-
iar with the World VV1de Web, several uni-

versities have caught onto the trend and

have posted. their admissions applications
online. . ' - -

Schools such as Cornell University,-
Massachusetts Institute , of Technology,
Yale University and the University of
Pennsylvania offerat least some of their
applications» on the Internet.

“The students were asking for it,”
said Margaret Porigow, director of opera-'
tions for Penn’s undergraduate admis-
sions. ‘

In this first year of offering applica-
tions electronically, students can only sub-
mit their first sections via the Web. The
essay, recommendations and transcript

must still be ﬁlled out on paper and mailed .

to the admissions office.

. Porigow said that while the reception
to the online applications has been warm,
there has been some hesitance on the part
of students to rely exclusively on the Web.
To date, only about 100 of the 600 appli-

‘ cations started online have been submit-‘C

ted, he said. i
The application has been available for
only two weeks. .
Many students have been utilizing the
online application to practice the applica-

S Tl-IE. Pin News

tion process but have preferred to send in
their actual submissions via standard mail.
While ‘Porigow said that the online
application has been embraced, she was
hesitant to predict that the Web would one
day make paper applications obsolete.
“There are so many secondary
schools in the world that I don’t know
when everyone will have access to the
Web,” she said.

Porigow said that she expected inter— .

national students in particular to take
advantage of Internet availability, because
overseas mail can be unpredictable.

Yale decided to enter the online scene
in order to ease the application process.

The university plans to have the bio-
graphical data -formp of its application
online within two weeks, said. Margit
Dahl, Yale’s director of undergraduate
admissions. However, like - at Penn, the
rest of the application must be mailed’ to
the admissions ofﬁce;

“It just seemed like the way to go,”»

Dahl said.

Students are not the only ones who.

beneﬁt from the convenience of online
applications. Admissions officers are
grateful for the technology as well.

The new onlineiapplication is being
integrated with the Yale computer system,
feeding all information sent through the

. Internet directly into the computer data-

base. ,

w i re

eliminated through this system. Staff
members still have to ensure that all files

are transferred accurately, but the online"
application makes data input a lot faster.

Dahl pointed out that about half of the
Yale applications are received within a
week of the Dec. 31 deadline, which

causes a three-week backup period for '
-inputting data. The online applications can

move to the “head of "the line” because
they do not need to be re—typed into the
computer, she said.

“I think this is the wave of the future,”
she added.

Cornell is another member of the Ivy
League that initiatedionline applications
this fall. The University received about 20
applications electronically the first week
the applicationwas available.

“I’m optimistic, although I read a
recent report that students still prefer the

it the Internet

paper application,” said Deb Durnam, the
associate director of undergraduate admis-
sions at Cornell.

_ Dumam said students have expressed
concerns about the security of information

on the Internet.
“Students still like to have a paper
copy in hand,” she added. ’
Although they may save time, appli-

cations transmitted electronically are not

looked at more favorably by Cornell than
those submitted through the U.S. Postal
Service. '

“An application sent electronically
has no advantage over a handwritten
application, and we tell students that,”
Durnam said.

While this is a pilot year for online
applications at Cornell, Yale, and Penn,
MIT is in its third year of accepting online
applications for undergraduate admis-
sions.

“Everyone seems to have access to"

the Web these days,” said Erika Jonietz,
an admissions counselor, “It’s easier for
them [students] to access the application
online.” ‘ ‘

J onietz said that the reason that MIT
did not receive more applications elec-
tronically in years past is that the applica-
tion was not available online until later in
the year.

This year, however, MIT’s online
application was available Sept." 1, con-
tributing to the increased response.

they want to, [other students] can go
off campus to drink.”

Freshman Mathew
agreed.

“Designating the towers as alco-
hol—free is fine with me,” he said.

However, the new rule was not
met with acceptance by all students.

“These Towers are supposed to
be our homes,” said Jay
Reichenbacher. “Having restrictions
placed on you plus having no
choice in the matter is not what I
call home.

“People cause problems regard-
less of whether they are drunk or
not,” he said. “Besides, people come
into these Towers with concealed
beer cans. Some have them in their
backpacks, and others have them
wrapped up in something. They get
through, drunk or not, and don’t
cause problems. We don’t _get
searched when we come in, so who
knows what you’ve got.”

Freshman Jessica Barber object-
ed to making Towers A and B dry
while still permitting alcohol in
Tower C.

“Either have it where there’s no
drinking in the Towers or [make it
so] you can drink in all of them, not
just certain ones,” she said.

As an incentive for students to
avoid alcohol abuse, the Residential
Living Committee will offer a series
of awards to students who refrain
from misusing alcohol.

“If students go off campus to
drink and come back to the dorms
and they can walk and talk and are
not banging into the walls and are
not falling down, there is no prob-
lem,” Sivulich said. “But if they
come back and can’t show their I.D.
cards, and they don’t know their
names and need assistance to their
rooms, that’s a problem and will
preclude them from receiving an
award.”

Resident directors and assis-
tants, along with other. students,
nominate individuals who support
established programs, display good
behavior and refrain from misusing
and abusing alcohol. The committee
then convenes to select an individ-
ual or an entire ﬂoor ofa residence
hall worthy of winning an award.

“We want to give awards and
provide incentives as positive rein-
forcement,” said Sivulich.

The Residential Living
Committee will reward: students
who adhere to the following criteria.

'0 Students cannot have a record
of an alcohol violation or misbehav-
ior related to alcohol on or off cam-
pus. ’ V

0 Studentsmust actively partic-
ipate in and support activities and
programs designed to decrease the

Hoffan »

amount of alcohol on campus. Some
of these programs include activities
held in residence halls, the
University-wide alcohol— free pro-
gram, Alcohol Awareness Week and
the Wellness Fair.

- Students must act as good role

.models by displaying responsible

behavior, mutual respect and leader-
ship capabilities.

An award is also given to a ﬂoor
that actively participates in and fol-
lows the criteria established by the
Residential Living Committee.

Awards are donated by organiza-
tions that support the University’s
efforts in curtailing the consumption
of alcoholic beverages in residence
halls. s A '

0 Student Affairs and Residence
Life donated 13 $50 gift certificates
for the University Book Center.

- Student Affairs contributed
three “$200 cash awards for individ-
ual floors.

0 The University Book Center
donated a Pitt sweatshirt with the
“Alcohol Free@Pitt” logo on it.

- Food Services donated $50 to
be used anywhere dinning dollars
are accepted. -

- The Department of Parkin
and Transportation gave away a
month of free parking. v

The Residential Living
Committee is promoting social
activities as an alternative to exces-
sive drinking. Another committee
goal is to provide an appropriate and
stable living environment for stu-
dents who are recovering from alco-
hol dependency.

“People have said to me, ‘Do
you think that the University of
Pittsburgh has an alcohol problem?’
and I said ‘No, I don’t think the
University of Pittsburgh does,
Sivulich said. “But I think many stu-
dents attending the University do.”

semester began. Three of the acci-
dents have taken place in the past
four days.

, Each of the accidents occurred
within several hundred feet of Fifth
Avenue and Bigelow Boulevard.
Three of those four incidents
involved Port Authority buses.

According to Commander
Delaney, in two accidents this week-
end, one victim suffered a severely
bruised hip, and the other suffered
extensive damage to the mouth.

“It’s unfortunate to have to say
this, but we are lucky that this is the
extent of the injuries, but it is obvi-
ous that something needs to
change,” said Delaney. “It can’t stay
the way it is.”

Delaney said some of those
changes involve Pitt Police, but any
dramatic changes are out of their
hands. Pitt Police intends to add
more officers to the area and may
also begin reprimanding student
jaywalkers.

Once he has prepared statistics,
Delaney also intends to meet with
Port Authority and city officials to

  A reminder: Look both ways
before crossing the street

Another day, another Pitt stu-
dent hit by a Port Authority bus.

Fifth Avenue is a dangerous
road; we feel we should not have
to remind people in- an editorial‘ to
look both ways before crossing.

Three Pitt students being hit
by Port Authority buses on Fifth
Avenue recently —— two on
Friday, one yesterday —— serves
as a sore reminder that everyone
needs to keep this in mind.

For heaven’s sake, look both
ways before crossing the street!

True, Fifth Avenue is an
unusual street. It’s not normal to
have buses run in the opposite
direction on a one-way street. It
does take time to get used to the
marked bus lanes used in most
American cities. «'

But that’s what the railings
along the edge of Fifth Avenue
are for — to remind those with
deﬁcient road-crossing skills that
there’s a bus lane with a few
buses driven by seemingly-psy-
chotic bus drivers._

The traffic lights on Fifth
Avenue are timed in‘ such a way
as to create “smooth driving” for
all those going 30 miles per_hour.
This smooth ﬂow of traffic —— or
more appropriately, rush of cars
hoping to drive through a string
of green lights —- makes crossing

the street much more treacherous
and not too smooth for pedestri-
ans.

As for bus drivers, what can
we say but, “take it easyl” We
know the majority of bus drivers
are not out for blood, but they
should keep a better eye out for
pedestrians. Eyes are made for
observation 4 included in the
driver’s scope along with cars
and the -street should be pedestri-
ans. -
Pitt has done all it can-to try
prevent bus accidents from hap-
pening (the railings are an exam-
ple of that). The city appears to be
trying dosomething: It’s experi-

_menting with an idea to widen the

sidewalk on Fifth Avenue near
Bellefield Avenue and convert
one of the regular trafﬁc lanes
into a bus lane. .

As argued in opinions articles
regularly over the past two years,
the closure of Bigelow Boulevard
between Fifth and Forbes
avenues would" help, too. If there
is a battle between pedestrians
and automobiles being waged,
the main battleﬁeld appears to be
in this area.

For now, take the words of
your kindergarten teacher to
heart, and look both ways before
crossing the street.

Privatization: worse the: n
VV1th the 1998 election just weeks away, the ,

American people will undoubtedly hear more
talk about the supposedly solemn problems fac-
ing programs such as Social Security.
Unfortrmately, I fear that a lot of the talk you will
hear in the coming weeks is hot air. Here is why:

The fate of Social Security, at ﬁrst glance,
does not look good. With the retirement pop1_1la—
tion poised to swell when the baby boomer gen-

eration begins to retire around the year 2012,.

Social Security trustees alarmed the nation in
1994 by dramatically armouncing that the Social
Security trust fund will be bankrupt by the year
2029. Ifnothing is done by then, the federal gov-
ernment would either have to devote the entire
federal budget to entitlement projects such as
Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, or raise
taxes by at least 50 percent _ .
This dire warning has given new momen-
tum to various Social Security reform schemes,
the most talk of which has centered
around the proposal to privatize the

market. Considered in the context of
Wall Street’s growth over the last 20
years, this idea sounds good But
like everything in life, the devil is in the details.

' In 1929, a respected economics professor at
Yale armounced: “Stocks have reached what
looks like a permanently high plateau.” The
world had to wait less than two weeks to see the
professor proven utterly wrong. The events of
1929 serve as a wanting for us nearly 70 years
later, in light of the stock market’s recent ﬂuctu-
ations. The unpredictable nature of the market
makes privatization unrealistic. A mistake as
simple as a--miscalculation in the rate of increase
would be enough to throw the whole program
into utter chaos and leave millions of the elderly
without adequate incomes to

choices by adopting the path of least resistance.
A real solution to this problem has been pro-
posed by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the distin-
guished senator from New York Moynihan
wants the government to cut ,1 percent from the
Consumer Price Index. The reason: Social
Security payments are adjusted for inﬂation by
tying them to the Consumer Price Index, which
many economists believe is overestimated by 1
percent each year. Therefore, Social Security

the problem

beneﬁciaries receive too much money. (About
seven dollars a month too much). This 1 percent
may not sound like a whole lot of money, but it

could reap tremendous rewards. According to‘

Moynihan, this ﬁx “would save $1 trillion over
the next twelve years.” Such a change would be
enough to keep the Social Security trust fund sol-
vent for decades to come. Unfortunately, the
common sense and reason of Moynihan’s, pro-
posal might be_ drowned out by all of the panicky
shouting done by the champions of privatization;
one of the biggest problems with‘Social Security,
and politics in general, is the overheaded rhetoric
and proliferation of faulty information.

In a recent speech, Speaker of the House
Newt Gingrich made the argument for future
changes in Social Security, claiming that “more
people below the age of 30 believe in UFOs than
believe in their Social Security pensions.” This
bit of propaganda, which has been repeated often
enough in the news as fact, is real-
ly‘ a monstrous lie. A recent poll
asking the American people what
they had more faith in —— Social

Social Security won by a resound-
ing 71 percent to 26 percent margin.

The poll Gingrich referredlto was commis- A

sioned by -the ._ right-wing group, Third

Millennium, which asked a loaded question,

knowing full well what the answer would be.
This sort of intellectual dishonesty is characteris-
tic of those who are ‘anxiously awaiting the

opportrmity to dismantle the_ most successful ‘

program that ever came out of the New Deal.
In the end, the dilemma before the
American people is this: Do we listen to the nat-
tering, nabobs of negativity that are the privatiza-
tion advocates? Can the American people really
be expected to buy into the argument that we

must “save” Social Security by destroying it?
: Ultimately, we must do the smart thing and fol-

low through with Senator Moynihan’s proposal
to save Social Security. It will undoubtedly pre-
serve Social Security the safest way.

The choice is yours to make. Choose wise-
ly and let your elected representatives know

what you think by voting on election day.

Democracy has never been a spectator sport.

Columnlst

There are certain issues that Pitt students
gripe about year after year. Usually I stray
from these, because little or nothing can or
will ever be done about them. I prefer the
“let’s make the best of it” approach.
However, in the following cases, I just could

not take any more.

The meal plan Food Services has
imposed on us is ridiculous. I was not a big
critic at ﬁrst, ﬁguring the department had our
best interests at heart. In the past month, my
loathing has grown immensely. While the
weekly plan may work for some students, it
certainly doesn’t for me and for many others.

The worst part is not necessarily that the
meal plan was changed — it’s that it was
changed with ‘little or no notice given to stu-
dents. I remember getting a letter in the mail
and seeing a few posters, but that was about
it. Also, I’m the type of student who actually
stops and reads signs posted on

It took quite a while for students to realize

asked about it.

interest determined that students over-
whelrningly supported the change in the
parking and transportation fee. Now was that

The world has NEVER seen a true socialist state

Michael Conn and -

Jessica Tooma , .

Maybe Michael Berquist got his ideas
about socialism ﬁorn watching “Buﬂ’y the
Vampire Slayer,” because it obviously was-
n’t from reading Marx, who never advocat-
ed anything like the oppressive and bureau-
cratic regimes that defenders‘ of capitalism
like Berquist want us to believe is “social-
ism.” (“Socialismz government for the fool-
ish,” The Pitt News, Sept. 24).

Berquist is also ignorant of the fact that

A the International Socialist Organization was

founded on a, rejection of the so-called
socialism of the Soviet Union, China and
other states he criticizes. He asks, “Don’t
these people know the Berlin Wall came
down?” as if this fact is somehow in conﬂict
with what we believe. We celebrated the end

‘ of these phony “socialist/communist” states

as much as anyone.

Berquist is absolutely correct when he
describes these states as creating “a two-
tiered society: a governing elite that concen-
trates power and wealth for their own enjoy-
ment while the poor toil away to support
them. In effect, the rich get richer and the
poor get poorer. This is power to the peo-
ple?” No, it’s capitalism

Socialism advocates a society democra-
tically controlled by the majority of the peo-
ple, which clearly did not exist in the states
Berquist describes in his column. These
states were 11111 in basically the same way
any capitalist country is run: They exploited
workers to make proﬁts and used them to

compete with other capitalist countries on
theworldmarket—namely, intheareaof
arms production. The only difference
between these “socialist” countries and the

' rest of the capitalist world is that the state

controlled everything.

The world has not yet seen more than
the earliest stages of the kind of society Marx
talked about. For a glimpse of what socialist
society would be like, we have to look at
mass strikes such as those in Seattle in 1919
or France in 1968, and the beginnings of the
revolutions in Russia in 1917, Spain in 1936
and Hungary in 1956. During the Seattle
general strike, workers ran the city. Laundry
workers, ﬁreﬁghters and garbage-wagon dri-
vers organized themselves to maintain
essential  Cooks and waiters formed
a commissary department that served 30,000
meals a day to the strikers. »

In May 1968, workers across France
occupied their workplaces. le F iguro, a
mainstream newspaper in the city of Nantes,
said: “  VV1thin a few days, one system has
displaced another. Today the unions hold
power completelyand the police comrr1is-
sioner, who has nothing to govem save a few
faithful civil servants and a bailiﬁ who is still
there, no one knows why. Since the police
can do nothing about the most urgent prob-
lems, an inter-urrion strike committee was
set up in city hall. Little by little it has taken
over administration of the city ...”

In the Russian Revolution, workers
went further and actually took control of
society in the form of elected workers’ coun-
cils called Soviets. Women had the right to

vote and rum for oﬂice before they had those
rights in the U.S. All oppressive laws against
homosexuality were wiped olf the books. Of
course, these gains were short—lived

The working class was decimated by a
war with invading armies, and Stalin came
to power, brutally crushing all opposition.
Attempts to build socialist societies based on
workers’ power have not failed due to their
own shortcomings. Rather, they’ve been vio-
lently crushed by capitalist forces that were
either trying to regain their lost power or
were afraid their own populations would be
inspired by-the example. This includes the
Russian tanks rolling into Hungary to crush
the workers’ revolution there. _

Berquist says “Free trade and minimal
government interference go a long way
toward improving the quality of life for
everyone,” but a look around the world
today shows the complete failure of the free
market It was supposed to make Russia
prosperous. Instead, Russia is on the brink of
collapse and millions of workers there have
not been paid in months. In South Korea it is
estimated that 25 people commit suicide out
of desperation every month, and neariy a
million have lost their jobs since the begin-
ning of this year. Japan, the world’s second-
largest economy, is being hit by a severe
recession. Despite Berquist’s raving about
Taiwan, it will not be exempt front the crisis.
“A growing economy witha bright future”

-——.isn’t that what economists said not so ‘

long ago about Indonesia and Thailand?
Thecrisishasnowspreadtolatin

America and will eventually hit:-the United

States. Even in the midst of a “healthy”
economy, layoﬁs have been widespread.
The majority of people inthe United States
havealready seen their standard of living
plummet. One in four children goes to bed
hungry. Over 43 million ‘people don’t_have
health care, and most of those who do have

to endure HMOS. Since welfare has been

cut, the social safety net is effectively gone.

When the crisis hits here, it will feel as
bad as the Depression of the 1930s for many.
What has been demonstrated the world over
is that free-market policies do not work, and
ﬂre brunt of failure is felt by woridng people.
Forttmately, it has also been demonstrated
that people are increasingly ready to ﬁght
back. Even in the United States, the support
received by recent strikes at General Motors,
Bell Atlantic and Northwest Airlines shows
how fed up people are. .

The failure of capitalism is striking.
Everywhere, capitalist economies have col-
lapsed or fallen on hard times. Even capital-
ists who write for ﬂre Financial Tmtes (an
extremely pro-capitalist paper) can see the
relevance of Marx’s ideas. In a recent issue,
columnist Edward Mortimer quoted “The
Communist Manifesto” to prove that “Marx
and ' Engels described a world economy
more like that of 1998 than 1848.” Marxism
has never been more relevant

ists really have to say to come to the [S019

tion?” 8:15 pm. Oct. 7in CL 219.

expected to operate in conformity with its
guidelines. In these years of mega~mergers, how

Bond   chokes
again, Bucs fans
not surprised  

Barry Bonds choked in-the play-
off to see who would go to the’
National Leagu_e Division Series
playoff.

Bonds, who is possibly one of the
best players of all—time, choked in the
most important game of the season

for the Giants. He was not able to_

contribute with his bat, and his

defense had little or no effect on the

game.

Bonds, who perennially hits 30
home runs and steals almost as many
bases, did not do a thing in the game
against the Cubs. —

What a surprise for everyonelin ‘

baseball — except Pittsburgh Pirates
fans. ' .

Bonds did his disappearing act
every year for the black and gold. He
was almost nonexistent for the Bucs
in the playoffs.

Each year, he would make a run
at the MVP award, but he would fal-
ter in the playoffs.

Some years, the Pirates would
have rather seen R.J. Reynolds or Joe
Orsulak in left field as opposed‘to
Bonds. They would at least hit, and
less would be expected of them.

The loss to the Braves in 1992
can be placed almost solely ‘ on
Bonds’ shoulders. He did not hit at all
in the series, and then his weak arm
could not throw out the slowest guy
on the Braves’ team. . ’

Francisco Cabrera lined a single .

into left field, and Sid Bream, who
had four knee ‘surgeries prior to the
. 1992 season, was "off like a streak (0-
60 in three days) for third base.
Bonds came up throwing and
fired the ball to home plate. ‘
Bream was able to slide in around
the tag of Mike LaValliare to score
the winning run and send the Pirates
home without a chance at the pennant
for the third year in a row. I
The most enduring image of that
series is Andy Van Slyke lying ﬂat on
his stomach in center field, exhibiting
the agony of defeat as the Braves cel-
ebrated another World Series berth.
Bonds didn’t do’ much better in
any of the other series for the Bucs.
Manager Jim Leyland could not get
his team’s top performers to perform
in the big games, but that is not the
manager’s job. , .

The Panthertmen’s soccer team contin-

by the Boston College Eagles 3-0 Saturday.

the 33rd minute when senior Keith
McDonald tallied his ﬁrst goal of the season
unassisted from 20 yards out

Bill Hicks chases down the ball ahead
of two West Virginia defenders.

'Ihe,P1tt defense was handcuffed once .

again just fo11r minutes later, when 
Boyd struck on a pass from senior Chris

Lynch. Senior Darmy Horan assisted on the 1

score to put Boston College up 2-0.

Boyd capped the Eagles scoring drive
in the 57th minute, blasting a shot off ﬂie
crossbar and into the goal behind Panther
goalkeeper Chris Hanlon. Sophomore Sjur
Gunderson had the "assist-on the ﬁnal goal,
giving the Eagles a 3-0 lead.

Boston College goalkeeper Chris

Hanlon made three saves in 65 minutes, and
Mike Norris made two saves in the ﬁnal 25
minutes.

Saturday’s shutout came just four days
after another shutout This one was in the

I . soccer version of the Backyard Brawl,

when the Moutaineers of West Virginia beat
the Panthers 3-O.

' The Mountaineers used an aggressive
offense and accurate passing to keep the
Panthers on the defensive for much of the
game. _ ’

WVU forward Chris Patton nailed a
strong header past Hanlon in the 12th
minute. The Mountaineers kept the offen-
sive assault going as two shots from just
outside the goal-box sailed wide.

‘ The Panther offense ‘was virtually

nonexistent in the ﬁrst half. Sloppy passing
and a strong WVU defense eﬁectively
stalled the Panthers.

The team’s ﬁrst real scoring chance
came with 23 minutes left in, the half.

Spencer Barton broke in on net, but play .

was whistled dead when Barton and the
goalie collided _
The only other chance for Pitt was a

penalty kick with 15 :10 left before halftime. '

Midﬁelder Kopp had his kick blocked by
the head of one of the Mountaineer defend—
ers.

WVU’s Chin Orih scored 12 minutes
into the second half on a great single effort,
putting the team up by two. Orih would tally
his second goal of the contest 22 minutes
later oﬁ a- throw-in. - c

The defense continued to play well in ,

the second half, but the offense just couldn’t
put it together.

booted a pass from Cande Ruiz into the
upper right comer of the net.

Ruiz added a goal in the 22nd
minute, but she wasn’t finished yet. She
closed off Pitt’s scoring with a goal in
the ﬁnal minutes of the first half, off a
pass from freshman Katrina Shibata.

The Lady Friars answered with one
goal in the first half, with Patricia
Moore scoring off an assist by Jill
Flanagan. Moore added another goal in‘

' the second half to make the final 3-2 in

favor of Pitt. _

The win should leave Pitt in third
place in the Big East, and that would,
historically, give them a shot at the
playoffs, according to Sturk.

“After two recruiting classes, we
feel pretty good about where we are.
We are very happy we can score goals,”
Sturk said. A ' -

Lady Panther Jen Huzvar takes one for
the team in Pitt’s win ‘over Providence.

The Lady Panthers have scored
almost as many goals this year as they
have in the previous two combined.

0 ‘ BC handed the Lady Panthers a loss
Friday‘ night on a last-second goal,
which ended the game. The game was a

. draw, with even play throughout, but

the Lady Eagles stole the ball and the
victory on a goal by Megan Moore in
the 89th minute, with Janice Collein
recording the assist.

Although it was a disheartening
loss, Sturk found several positive points
to take away from the experience.

“Boston College is a much
improved team from last year, and we
gave the best effort we had. Our inex-
perience shows. With only two juniors,
we rely heavily on freshman and sopho-
more contributions,” ‘ Sturk said.
“Unfortunately we lost, but hopefully
we can gain experience from the

For The Pitt News

The Pitt volleyball team ended
the weekend with a split in its first
two conference games.

The Panthers defeated St. J ohn’s
in the weekend’s first game Friday,
sweeping the Red Storm 3-0.

A solid effort from the entire
squad resulted in the Panther victo-
ry. Marcia Thiesen led the team
with 13 kills, and'Melissa Alpers
added another 11. '

The defense was menacing,
holding St. John’s to scores of 12,
2, and 9. Alpers led the team with

13 digs, while Thiesen and Kelly,

Meyers followed close behind with
10 and eight digs respectively.

The Panthers couldn’t keep
their winning touch on Sunday, los-
ing a very competitive game to
Connecticut at Fitzgerald Field
House.

The Huskies took the match by
a score of 3-1. Thiesen led the
offensive-attack with 21 thunderous
kills.
Meinhart added another 15 and 12
kills. Alpers led the defense with 22
digs, and Tara Haefner and
Meinhart pitched in with 18 and 15.
The team gave a great effort, but
lost momentum and fell short in the
end.

the weekend games, was named Big

Last year, I was at a game against

Pittsburgh fans toward Bonds, as
does the chorus of boos he receives

depth in the defensive squad.

“Larry [Coyer, Pitt’s defensive
coordinator,] and the staff stayed
with our seconds. I think that
showed great confidence. That’s
really something I’ve always
believed in — you win by playing a
lot of people.

“During the ball game, [the
defensive coaches] have kind of
gone to a little bit of free substitu-
tion  which means that the coach-
es aren’t involved in the substitu-
tion as much; the players take care
of it themselves based on the
amount of time the coaches want
them to play,”«phe said.

In addition to the praise Harris

FROM PAGE 10

gave his defense, he also heralded.

the play of wide receiver Latef
Grim, who is leading the Big East
in both receptions and receiving
yards per reception.

“We’re thrilled that he’s been
able to respond so well,” said
Harris. “And the thing that I’m
excited about is  it’s nice to have
one of our players‘ nationally
ranked, and that helps us sell our
program.” , ,

Harris said his offense may not
receive any aid, from senior wide
receiver Terry Murphy during this
Saturday’s game against the

Heels. Murphy played sparingly
against Akron due to an ankle
injury. .

“Hopefully, he’ll be ready to go,
but right now he’s still gimping
around,” . Harris said.
Carolina has an outstanding set of
corners. They play a lot of bump
and run and will be in our face, so
we need every talented player we
have in order to have a chance
against those corners.”

Additionally, Harris said he
believes UNC should provide a
challenge to Pitt’s offensive line.

“They’re tall, good—looking
guys, you know. They don’t have
too many 217-pound defensive ends
like we have,” Harris said. “So they
are impressive on tape.”

Though Harris ' admitted Akron
was not one of the toughest oppo-.
nents on Pitt’s roster, he dismissed
the {idea that Saturday’s victory
should be overlooked.

“Winning is what this is all
about, is why we work so hard, and
it doesn’t matter against whom,” he
said.

Another Deloitte Consulting Difference

THEM:
Get a life

DELOITTE CONSULTING:
Got a life

Work/ life balance. The buzz of the_ moment.
Everyone in corporate America is aware of the
research showing people's desire to get ahead in
their company while getﬁng more out of life away
from the job.

Deloitte Consulting has long been committed to
helping people achieve this important balance -
«. well before it was “the thing to do.” Here, you'll
work hard. And, yes, travel is often involved. But
we also have programs in place that ensure your
other responsibilities can be met.

We just happen to think that an employee who is
relaxed, fulﬁlled, involved, content — ultimately
does a better job. So, is it any wonder that Deloitte
& Touche was named in Fortunes list of “The 100
Best Companies To Work For In America”? If
you're intent upon building your career with a ﬁrm
-that- understands your need to balance your
personal and professional goals, stop by. What we
have to -say could change your life.

As a Systems Analyst at Deloitte Consulting, you
will work with seasoned professionals on high-
proﬁle assignments, as well as take part in technical
' ' and management consulting training courses
offered around the country. After training, you will
hit the ground running — and take on meaningful
responsibilities and tackle signiﬁcant business
problems leveraging stateof-the-art technologies.

The Business Analyst Program is designed for
individuals wishing to pursue an MBA from a

top business school. As part of a client engagement
team, you'll develop both consulting and

business competencies.
