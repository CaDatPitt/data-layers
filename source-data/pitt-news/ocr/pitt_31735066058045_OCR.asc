SEAC  
learns
of Idaho

By Chris Lombardo
For The Pitt News

“This is where it hap-
pened,” said local
folksinger Anne Feeney
as she gazed around the
foyer in David Lawrence
Hall last night. She
explained that in 1969,
she and hundreds of oth-
ers held a protest in that
foyer — a protest against
Dow Chemical and Pitt’s
ROTC program.

“We felt that the univer-
sity should not be part of
the killing system: the
ROTC needed to go.”
According to Feeney, the
ROTC was forced off
campus for a while, but
eventually it returned.

Feeney was there to join
songwriter and environ-

/ mental activist Robert

Hoyt as he spoke and sang
to members of the Student
Environmental Action
Coalition and the public
about the timber industry
and the government’s
stronghold on public
lands. Hoyt, who has been
touring around the coun-
try “talking to who will

listen” for several years,

teaches about environ-
mental issues through his
songs, videos and speech-
es, which serve one main
purpose —— to inform peo-
ple about what is being
done to their land.

Hoyt specifically came
to talk about the Nez
Perce National Forest in
Idaho. An area in this for-
est known as the
Cove/Mallard region has
been targeted by the U.S.
Forest Service. The USFS
plans to decimate this area
with 145 miles of logging
roads and 200 clear—cuts.
Those clearcuts, accord-
ing to Hoyt, will remove
enough trees to ﬁll 26,000
logging trucks. ‘

“[USFS] is cutting
down our forests, and
we’re paying for it,” Hoyt
said. He stressed several
times that the government
is using taxpayers’ money
to clear-cut land. “The
U.S. taxpayers will lose
an estimated $6 million in
tax money by the time the
Cove/Mallard project is
completed.”

In addition to timber

Medical center expands its reach

By Eric M. Smith
For The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center has expanded
its geographic reach with
announced affiliations to area
hospitals.

St. Margaret Memorial

« Hospital, South Side Hospital

and Passavant Hospital have
approved an intent to affiliate
with the UPMC.

“The university is who we
wanted to dance with,” said
Stephen Kelly, vice president of
planning and development for
South Side Hospital, “with the
hope of getting‘ engaged and
maybe getting married down
the road.”

This may be as clear a state-
ment as can be made at this
time. Different boards repre-
senting both the UPMC and the
area hospitals have been meet-
ing but have yet to announce
any specifics.

“The goal is to more effi-
ciently serve people in different
geographic areas,” said UPMC
spokesperson Jane Duffield.
Unanswered were the questions
of how this would effect
employees and customers.

Duffield and spokespersons
for the various entities stress the
“independence and autonomy”
of the hospitals. All were

emphatic that the tentative‘

agreements did not involve any
money and were concerned

strictly with services.

“[The afﬁliation] is part of an
effort to build a health care net-
work,” said Robyn Beckwith,
manager of public relations for
Passavant.

Blue Cross/Blue Shield
would not comment on the pro-
posed alliance but confirmed
that the recent affiliates were
now included in the University
Health Network. The UHN is a
health plan currently aimed at
employees and students of the
university.

Health America, which lost
its contract with Montefiore
Hospital soon after the hospi-
tal’s integration into the UPMC,

also declined comment.

Schenley Quad hosts fall fling today

By Eric Owens
For The Pitt News

The parking lot in Schenley Quadrangle will go
through a face-lift today as the carnival comes to

IOWII.

The Office of Residence Life and the Resident
Student Association will be holding a small cami-
val called the Fall Fling today near Bruce and
Brackenridge halls from 4-8:30 p.m.

According to Kishma DeCastro, resident direc-
tor for the Schenley Quadrangle, the event will
feature a disc jockey and a number of different
concession booths where students can take part in
a variety of activities. “We wanted to plan an

minimal cost,” DeCastro said.
According to DeCastro, the event will feature
various carnival games which will be free to stu-

dents, and different types of food will be available
for a small cost. The booths will be staffed by res-

ident assistants from Bruce, Brackenridge and

event for students to come out and have fun at a

McCormick halls. DeCastro said the Residence
Life staff has done a considerable amount of
work in planning the event.

She said RSA has also helped with the prepara-
tions, although its involvement has been some-
what limited by time constraints. She said mem-
bers of the organization have contributed consid-
enable time to the event. Part of the funding also
came from RSA, as well as from Residence Life

HOUSTON — Incessant rains
and floodwaters shut down
much of Houston Tuesday as
the death toll reached seven in

ern Texas.

All of southeastern Texas was
under a ﬂood warning as up to
20 inches of rain inundated parts
of the region for 36 hours.

Driving rains lasted through

WASHINGTON — In a big
setback for General Motors, the
U.S. Department of
Transportation said Monday that
GM’s controversial I973-’87
model full—sized pickup trucks
posed an unreasonable safety
risk and may need to be
recalled.

The finding, announced by
Transportation Secretary
Federico Pena, could cost GM
up to $1 billion in repair costs
and billions more in potential
product liability verdicts if the
vehicles are recalled.

Pena said the vehicles, with
fuel tanks mounted outside the
frame rails, have been involved
in a number of accidents result-
ing in 150 fatalities. He said the
crashes might have been surviv-
able if GM used a different
design. — Reuters

extraction and road building, the
Nez Perce is home to many
endangered species like the griz-
zly bear, grey wolf and Chinook
salmon, which could be
destroyed also if their delicate
ecosystem is disturbed by log-
ging activities.

However, efforts to combat
the USFS and logging compa-
nies in the Cove/Mallard region
have not gone unnoticed. In
February, an Idaho court passed
an injunction against the USFS,
stopping timber extraction and
road building in Cove/Mallard.

According to Hoyt, the service
failed to do an Environmental
Assessment of the region before
starting the project. This caused
the courts to lower a temporary
axe on the USFS. On the other
hand, the Idaho Congress passed
a law making it illegal to orga-
nize protests against certain gov-
ernment activities, specifically
those of the USFS.

Beckwith stressed the size of
Passavant and its prominence
in service to northeastern
Allegheny County. The hospi-
tal has recently expanded to
contain 292 beds, 420 physi-
cians and approximately 1,400
employees. An affiliation may
lead to expanded residency
programs, said Beckwith.

St. Margaret, northwest of
the city, is also looking to
increase its residency program.
It began a program for family
practice 12 years ago said
Tracy Maslek, spokesperson
for the hospital. Much of the
recent health care debate has
focused on the need for more
family practitioners.

“As a small community hos-
pital, we have needs that we
have difficulty fulﬁlling,” said
Kelly of South Side. He cited
the ability to attract primary
care physicians and inclusion
in a network competing for
managed care contracts as pos-
sible benefits from the affilia-
tion.

Press releases issued by the
UPMC point out that adminis-
trative tasks may be combined
for improved efficiency. The

large number of hospitals will '

also increase the purchasing
power of large quantity items,
said Kelly. No one would com-
ment on combining such ser-
vices as cleaning and food

preparation.

As it stands now,the UPMC
includes Presbyterian
University Hospital,

Monteﬁore University Hospital
and Western Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic. There are
1,221 beds, 1,295 physicians,
and over 9,000 employees,
making it the largest employer
in the area.

and student activity fees.
“RSA has helped as much as

they could,” DeCastro said. ’

“We’ve been planning this
event since the second or third
week of September. My [RSA]
hall council wasn’t even
formed yet, and it wasn’t some-
thing we could wait to do.”

DeCastro said that in past
years different resident direc-
tors have tried to do different
things with the event, from car-
nival—like approaches to cook-
outs. “Everyone has a different
interpretation of it,” she said.
“This year it should be some-
thing new.”

According to David
Homyak, assistant director of
Residence Life and advisor for
RSA, the two organizations
involved have tried to hold
similar events every year but
have not always met with suc-
cess. In past years, the event
has been hampered by weather,
but Homyak said that this year
it will be held rain or shine.

“This used to be something
the quad staff did every year
either in the fall or the spring,”
Homyak said. “But we haven’t
always had the opportunity to
do it in the past.”

Panhandlers must go

A Department of Public Safety investigation has uncovered
a mind-blowing fact: most of the panhandlers on Pitt’s campus
are neither handicapped nor homeless. Well, golly, we never
would’ve thunk it.

This is something which certainly comes as no surprise to
most Pitt students, who have been griping about annoying and
aggressive panhandlers for years. But there was some surpris-
ing and alarming information discovered in the investigation.
Reportedly, 30 of the panhandlers account for over 400 arrests
and 753 criminal charges, charges which include assault and
robbery.

These are alarming statistics. Panhandlers have long been
considered an annoyance and an eyesore on the streets of
Oakland, but this report takes the situation to an entirely dif-
ferent level. Seven hundred and fifty three criminal charges
for only 30 individuals is a staggering level. Certainly some of
these charges are likely minor and irrelevant. But having peo-
ple with an average of 25 criminal counts each loitering on the
streets of Oakland asking for money is hardly conducive to a
safe university atmosphere.

Many students have complained about the situation and not
merely because of annoyance. One CAS student commented
that he “cuts directly up to Fifth Avenue after class to avoid
Forbes” and the panhandlers.

It would be one thing if these were old and harmless-look-
ing individuals who are merely searching for a helping hand.
Some might still find that an annoyance, but they would
unlikely find it threatening. But a number of the actual pan-
handlers are young, large, aggressive and imposing. When you
pass the same six-foot-plus, healthy-looking individual every
day and are consistently asked for money, it can be intimidat-
ing. Pitt students should not have to be subjected to this. Our
urban campus is risky enough without allowing this added
risk. '

The Pitt News applauds the actions of the Department of
Public Safety and Director Rick Boyd in starting a campaign
to move these people out of the streets of Oakland.
Reportedly, public safety will provide support to the efforts of
the Pittsburgh City Council to draft an anti-panhandling ordi-
nance. '

The response so far from the Student Government Board has
been minimal other than to commend the actions of public
safety. Safety Chair Pat Catena said the SGB will take a more
definite position on the matter in a few days.

This is an ideal situation for the members of SGB to exer-
cise the leadership roles the student body of Pitt has granted
them. If SGB were to come out with a powerful statement in
support of public safety and to lobby the city council on
behalf of the safety of the students of Pitt to enact anti—pan-
handling legislation, it would go a long way toward bringing
about substantive action. The Pitt News urges SG_B to take a
stand and work for the safety of Pitt.

Personal look at gay fraternity members

What do you think of when
you hear about a fraternity
party? You probably think of
the usual straight meat market.
We think of a fraternity man as
one who wants sex from
young women. We think of
two college studentsnof the
opposite sex “hooking up.”
But is this really the case?

Sure, on the surface this is
what we see — a straight meat
market. The fact of the matter
is that there are at least two
gay males who belong to each
fraternity on this campus, and
I stress two being the least.
Just think about it. When you
are at these parties, at least
two men are scoping out the
other men. Trust me, I’ve done
it

sexuality. I hid my entire life. I
told my parents recently; they
disowned me. I told my close
friends. Well, I guess they
weren’t really my friends.
Basically, everybody I had
turned to for support turned
against me. I didn’t expect my
last family, my fraternity, to
accept me. After all, my very
own parents didn’t accept me.
I was afraid to take another
step out of that closet.

It’s true that there are many
fraternity queers. I’ve dated
men from many different
houses on this campus includ-
ing Sigma Alpha Epsilon and
Delta Tau Delta, as well as Pi
Kappa Alpha. To pretend that
gays in fraternities do not exist

brothers accepted me, but
there are still a select few who
want nothing to do with me.
Depending on the way one
interprets words, I’ve even
been asked to quit by this
select few. I guess they don’t
feel comfortable around me
now, but I’m still the same
person I’ve been since day
one.

Although many of my broth-

ers supported me, I still felt-

like an outsider, a disease,
someone around whom
nobody wanted to be. I felt
this way until three weeks ago,
when I was passing a fellow
brother and he extended his
hand to me. I can never
express how much that meant
to me. The only fam-

It’s foolish for the

atmosphere when the

to see men whom I

gay man in a frater-
nity. There is a difference
between other gay Greeks and
myself: I am NOT in that
proverbial closet any longer.

The Greek system does not
create a queer-positive atmos-
phere. Just about every gay
Greek I know is afraid of com-
ing out, afraid of the rejection.
I was afraid of this rejection as
well. I was afraid that the only
family I had left was going to
turn its back on me. Many
Greeks tend to take on that
small-town, homophobic atti-
tude. This fear of homosexual-
ity, something different, makes
it extremely difficult for gays
who are in that fraternity envi-
ronment to be honest with who
we are.

It took me a long time to
come to tenns with my homo-

is like believing the Earth is
flat. The lack of education
causes this popular belief. It
just hurts to see these fellow
queers, my friends, live inside
the closet as they pretend to be
people they’re not. I couldn’t
live like this anymore. I had to
come out to my last family at
any consequence.

Last month, I came out to
my fraternity, Phi Kappa
Theta. It was very difficult. I
felt like a disease, like I had to
hide from each of my brothers.
And, of course, I was not
accepted at first. As I said
before, it took me a long time
to come to terms with this
aspect of my life. I knew that
it would take some time for

my brothers to come to terms j

with it as well. Many of my

know in these frater-
nities still to be afraid of com-
ing out. The initial shock is the
most difficult part. If your fra-
ternity emphasizes true and
everlasting brotherhood, you
can be open about anything
and still have your family.

Since coming out, I’ve
been approached by many
Greeks as well as pledges
about this issue. There is more
diversity within the Greek sys-
tem than many want to
believe. -

I just long for the day when
every gay man and lesbian can
be out and proud about them-
selves without the fear of
rejection, no matter what the
situation may be.

I changed since childhood for the

tennis teams at Pitt.

A basic function of organized
sports is to have a referee, judge,
umpire or whatever control a con-
test so that fair play is at an opti- .
mum.

The Pitt tennis teams operate
without that basic function.

A couple of times this season,
players on the women’s squad
have had difficulty accepting the
calls of opponents. The latest was
Marla Zielinski after a match with
Canisius’ Robin Rocchio Oct. 12.

“I don’t like to accuse an oppo-
nent of being dishonest, but a lot
of her calls were just ba ,”
Zielinski said.

Players have been known to
compete with that “If it’s close,
take the call” attitude. When
someone asked one of the Pitt
women’s players why Pitt doesn’t
have umpires at the matches, she
retorted, “We’ re not the football
team.”

That’s true. The revenue sports
(football and men’s basketball)
haul in tons of lira for the univer-
sity, but that doesn’t mean a
smaller sport such as tennis
should play with one racket tied
behind its back. A

The tennis teams deserve the
basic functions of an organized
sport. How much could it cost
anyway? The Pitt football team
practices with referees, and even
intramural basketball games
(albeit not affiliated with the ath-
letic department) at Trees Hall are
officiated by student referees.

Pitt’s athletic department is
planning to restructure Pitt
Stadium and to build a convoca-
tion center. Both trinkets will cost
millions. Athletic Director Oval
Jaynes likes to say both are of
equal importance. Apparently. not
all things in the athletic depart-
ment are equal, which is fine if
the needs of every sport are met.

The hypocritical part is that if
Andre Agassi ever came to play a
few sets for charity at the Cost
Center, Pitt would be able to
spring for someone to judge the
match.

Lance Ito himself would be in the

When this season started,
the Pitt volleyball team was
anxious to maintain its role
as the top team in thesBig
East for the seventh consecu-
tive year.

However, due to a slow
start, the Lady Panthers
quickly found themselves in

' t h e
middle
of the
pack in
the Big
East —
not a
place
t h e y
w e r e
accustomed to being, nor a
place they planned on stay-
ing.

“I think we have a tradi-
tion. We have pride, and so
we like to play hard against
the Big East teams,” junior
Sarah Mikla said. ,

It is this positive attitude
that has helped the team to
find the win column in its
last five games, four of
which were against Big East
opponents.

Prior to the Lady Panthers’
winning streak, they were 8-
6 overall and 1-0 in the con-

Volleyball team rolls again in Big East

Jennie Driscoll and the rest of the Lady Panthers are hands
above the Big East competition, once again.

ference.

Their record now stands at
a healthy ‘13-6 overall and 5-
0 in the Big East, which

lands them on top of the con-

ference standings.

“We knew that we were a
good team, but it was just a

matter of playing like it,”

\ Mikla said. “I think a lot of

us just got to the point where
we were sick of playing bad.
I think we started playing
like we knew we could and
had a lot of self confidence,
and it all just came together.
I personally, and along with
some other people, [was] just
sick of losing,” she said.

“We knew that we were
better than what we were
playing, and we just wanted
to play at our ability. In our
training, we are doing every-
thing the same, but we just
decided to play.”

The current turning point
for Pitt came on Oct. 4, when
it lost to Akron, which is a
team it should have walked
all over.

“I think that match made
everybody re—evaluate them-
selves,” Pitt assistant coach
Brian Begor said.

“I think everybody had to
step back and examine what
their goals were for the team
and for themselves.”

Is it just a coincidence that
the team has gotten hot over
the past few weeks when its
schedule has it playing the
majority of its conference
games?

Pitt athletic trainers lend a healing hand

By Ed Ziegenfuss
Staff Writer

Tucked behind the sports
scene is a group of students
who do more for Pitt’s athletic
programs than most people
think. These are the student
athletic trainers.

The athletic training program
began at Pitt in 1980 when it
was moved to the School of
Education from the
Department of Orthopedic
Surgery.

“Since 1980, Pitt has had the
undergraduate athletic training
education program,” Dr. Scott
Lephart, administrative head of
the program, said. “It is accred-
ited by the NATA [National
Athletic Trainers Association]
and the Accrediting Body of
Allied Health Professionals.”

In 1992, Pitt was recognized
by the accrediting body as hav-
ing one of the strongest athletic
training programs in the nation.

Currently, the program at Pitt
employs five full-time head
trainers, along with 36 under-
graduates divided into three
practicum classes of 12 stu-
dents each. There are also 17
master’s degree students and
four doctorate students.

“You have got to have
patience. Training takes a lot of
time,” Matt Diehl, a second-
year student trainer, said. “Its
not a job, it’s a lifestyle.”

“You have to love what you
are doing in order to do a good

job,” said Kelly Meintel, also a
second-year student trainer.

Acceptance into this major is
not an easy task. On the aver-
age, 60 students apply after
their freshman year and after
completing the four basic pre-
requisites (general chemistry,
general psychology, basic ath-
letic training and an athletic
training laboratory). From this
group, 35-40 receive inter-
views from the staff, and 12 are
selected to the athletic training
program.

“We look at the student’s
overall academic capabilities,”
Lephart said. “We look for peo-
ple that have good
interpersonal
skills, that can
interact with ath-
letes, administra-
tors, coaches and
physicians.”

Upon admit-
tance, the student
trainers are placed into -one of
four training rooms, which are
located at Pitt Stadium,
Fitzgerald Field House, Trees
Hall and Carnegie Mellon
University. They also begin to
take classes such as anatomy,
physiology, first aid and CPR,
injury and evaluation and ther-
apeutic modalities and exer-
cise.

“There is a little bit more
time involvement with an ath-
letic trainer,” Dave Connors, a
third-year student trainer, said.
“When an athlete gets a day

 

 

off, a lot of times trainers. have
to come in for treatments.”

The student trainers’ respon-
sibilities are numerous. The
work in a training room is con-
tinuous, from pre—practice set-
up to post—practice treatments.

“The student athletic trainers
are essential to the program,”
Lephart said. “There is no way
the five full-time trainers could
provide the comprehensive ath-
letic training services that our
athletic department demands.”

“A student athletic trainer is
a great value,’’ said Kathy
Ashmen, head trainer at Trees
Hall. “Without them the train-

ing room would not

run nearly as
smoothly.”
“Here at the

university, [student
athletic trainers] do
everything,” Kevin

ATHLETIC TRAINING Conley, assistant

football trainer,
said. “They basically run the
athletic training program.
Without them, we wouldn’t be
able to operate at all.”

What the students see as the
best part of the athletic training
program varies.

“Seeing an athlete get better
is the best part,” said Jeff
Whiteford, a second-year stu-
dent trainer.

“The best part of the program
is that we are involved with our
career now that we will have
the rest of our lives,” said Scott
Boden, a first-year student

trainer.

The head trainers instruct the
students in every aspect of ath-
letic training. Rehabilitation,
injury treatment and training
room procedures are at the top
of the list.

“We do a good job in prepar-
ing our students for graduate

school and for the certification.

exam,” Conley said.

“How good of a trainer you
will be depends on the head
trainers, because they offer a
good learning experience,”
Meintel said.

The trainers try to keep ath-
letes as healthy as possible.

“I think the training room is
a morbid place,” said Matt
Bloom, starting guard for the
football team. “The less I see
of the trainers, the happier I
am.”

“To know that you’ve helped
someone who has been hurt
come back as soon as possible
is a great feeling,” Boden said.

Outside of the training room,
the students trainers participate
in the Student Athletic Trainers
Association. This association

publicizes the student trainers, ,

and each student is automati-
cally a member upon admit-
tance to the program.

“We want to get known more
to the public,” said Meintel,
current president of SATA. “So
people just don't see us out on
the field carrying water around;
they actually know what we
do.”

ing,” Begor said. “Other
than Boston College, we
started off the Big East with
what I think are two of the
three toughest teams in
Providence and Seton Hall. I
think we knew it was not
something we could work
into —— particularly with the
conference tournament only
going to fo_ur teams this
year,” he said.

“It was something where if
you are not ready to go right
now, you’re going to find
yourself with an early vaca-
tion.”

Not only have the Lady
Panthers improved their win
totals, but they have
improved their stats as well.
As of Oct. 17, they found
themselves ranked near the
top of the Big East in five of
the six major categories.

Several individual players
are also ranked atop the Big
East.

Stephanie Dufresne is
ranked second in assists with
11.3 per game. Jennie
Driscoll is ranked fourth in
blocks with 1.1 per game.

And on the defensive side,
Sara Mitchell is tied for sec-
ond in the conference with
3.5 digs per game.

“I think we are getting bet-
ter at a lot of issues,” Begor
said. “Certainly Mikla’s play
has been positive, and that
gives us a little added punch.
Stephanie [Dufresne] has
been in every day for the last
two weeks working on her
game individually, so I think
technically she is going to be

better.

“And when that position
[setter] gets better, then
everybody gets better.”

This weekend, Pitt will
meet both West Virginia and
George Washington at the
fieldhouse for what is
expected to be quality vol-
leyball.

“We want to play well and
avenge coach Majors’ loss
and try to get a backyard
brawl win of our own,”
Begor said.

“George Washington is the
team that knocked us out of
the NCAA tournament last
year. We made a lot of errors
and did not perform at a very
high level, and if you do that
then you’re out. That will be
a game we will naturally be
ready for, because I think
there is now a little rivalry,
and we know they are a
strong opponent.”

The Lady Panthers are now
in the position where the Big
East is theirs to lose, but if
they keep playing up to their
potential they should not
have any problems at all.

“We have positioned our-
selves to control our own
destiny,” Begor said. “But
you still have to go out and
take care of business.

“We are pleased with
where we are,” he said.

“I think we are in position 1

now where we can really
control our own destiny in a
lot of ways if we just win
out the rest of our matches,
and I think that is this team’s
goal right now. And I think it
is very realistic to do that.”
