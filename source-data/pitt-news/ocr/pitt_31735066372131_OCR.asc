Welsh said the government told
airlines to fly only 50 percent ofnor-

percent of normal, using supervisors
who are not_trained as controllers
and also controllers who were pre-

viously disqualiﬁed for medical rea-
sons. These reasons range from
alcohol and drug addiction to par-

the firing, we had ll people manning
20 positions.“

Scott said that between I974 and
I979, “job functions increased 70
percent and air traffic increased 45
percent. Job productivity increased
65 percent during this period with no
pay increase."

“We signed an oath stating that
we would not strike but the same
oath promised us a survivablejob,"
Welsh said.

Before they reach retirement, 89.2
percent of controllers are disquali-
fied for medical reasons. No con-
troller at Pittsburgh lnternational
ever retired, according to Welsh.
Medical reasons are stress-related—~
heart attacks. nervous breakdowns,
and ulcers.

Welsh listed some of PATCO’s
grievances. “We have to pay into our
own retirement and health insurance
plans, unlike the pilots who do not.
Pilots earn from $l l0.000 to
$l60,000 per year,Welsh said. “Last
year, my take-home pay was
$22,000. The pilots work half the
hours that we do.

“Another one of our grievances
was that we wanted a half-hour
lunch break,” he said.

Scott said. “There were I03 arti-
cles in ouricontract and the FAA
addressed four ‘of them. They
wanted to give us basically what we
had before. Our total contract
would have cost the government
$478 million overa four—year period.
Government figures say that it is
costing taxpayers over $2 billion to
replace us, and with a washout rate
of fifty percent for trainees, that fig-
ure will probably double."

“The government isn‘t just trying
to eliminate our union, they’re try-
ing to annihilate us," Welsh said.

“The president told the Housing
and Urban Development Corp. that
ifwe had any trouble with our mort-
gage payments to forclose imme-
diately. We cannot get unemploy-
ment or food stamps and our phones
are tapped. The FBI has a lot of us
under surveillance and some of us
are getting tied up in expensive legal
battles,” he said.

Welsh believes that big businesses
have gone to Reagan and asked him
to keep their employees from strik-
ing. “We are being used as an exam-
ple. At the time of our strike the
postal workers were negotiating
their contract and signed it after we
were all fired," he said.

The Civil Aeronautics Board at a
safety hearing in front ofa subcom-
mittee meeting in the House of
Representatives said that the
government is subsidizing the air-
lines that are losing money. Welsh
believes that the larger airlines will
survive the strike and end up taking
over much of the smaller
competition.

“The airlines are laying offa lot of
people; they’ve been waiting to do
this," he said. “Reagan is slackening
the affirmative action quotas so that
big business will be able to get rid of
people and be more selective about
who they hire back. They will be able
to weed out blacks, women, and
other minorities.

“lt‘s notjust PATCO, every labor
organigation is affected. and labor
sees it coming.“

Parking

former City of Pittsburgh
planner for Oakland, “There
isn’t enough parking in Oakland.
and the University (of Pitts-
burgh) is criminally negligent.
And the city. instead oftrying to
help solve the problem. can only
look at the situation with green
in its eyes. Meanwhile, students
are being used as bait for the
meter maids."

“We don‘t want to tag them.”

said Arleen Garland, a 17-year

veteran of the city’s meter maid
division. Garland regularly
worked the streets of Oakland
until three years ago, when she
took a desk job with the division
downtown.

“We don't wanttodoit. butwe
got to move ‘em out so somebody
else can get in.

“Every student We talked to
blames the city. But it’s not the
city’s fault. it’s the university’s.
The university hasn’t given the
students anyplace to go. They
just keep building buildings with
no parking in them.”

“Fault is a pretty strong
word," stated Assistant to the

 

The Pitt News, Friday, September 18, 1981

continued from page one

Vice Chancellor for Public
Affairs Jay Roling. “l‘d say no
one institution islat ‘fault.’ its
not just us, it's not just the city,
it's not just the Health Center—
it's everyone. The problem is that
this all started so long ago. All we
can try to do is remedy the prob-
lem as best we can."

lf that’s the case. what’s being
done‘?

“Several things," according to
Roling. One of these is a sticker
parking program to ease the
parking congestion in residential
neighborhoods.

“A resident will be able to go
downtown and purchase for 2 or
3 dollars a year a sticker, which
will enable them to park close to
their home. All other parking
will be limited to one or two
hours.” Roling added.

This plan should eliminate the
parking crunch in the residential
sections of Oakland but will

eliminate as well a valuable park-
ing resource for most university
students.
Where will all the students go?
“We’re hoping, of course. that

there is sufficient off-street
parking to fill our needs." That
parking. Roling said. will
become available when the hos-
pitals get the go—ahead from the
city planning commission for “a
new children‘s hospital. a shared
common facility. as well as con-
ceptual plans for a new eye and
ear hospital and plans to increase
their parking supply.

“All the new facilities.” Roling
added.“will have integral park-
ing underneath the buildings."

That should solve the problem
of off-street parking for all Pitt
students. But. as usual. it could
be years before all of this
becomes a reality. In the mean-
time. what’s the city doing about
all of this‘?

According to Thomas Gil-
foyle of the city treasury depart-
ment, the city is planning to raise
parking rates to 50 cents an hour.
Gilfoyle worked on a survey of
parking garages to determine
how much patrons were charged
to use the facilities.

Oakland won’t be the only
place where meter prices will go
up. but Gilfoyle said “it’ll most
likely be the first because of the
high number of meters in Oak-

land. One of the reasons was
because parking garages were
getting a couple ofdollars for the
first hour."

Williem said that “the city
should be encouraging people to
attend the University of Pitts-
burgh. not driving them away. It
shouldn‘t function as a pirate or

“So we're arguing to the state that
they ought to do more to prevent
that from happening."

Freeman emphasized the impor-
tance of funding for Pitt's School of
Medicine, which this year witnessed
the largest tuition hike in the
school's history. Tuition for stu-
dents residing in Pennsylvania up by
I7 percent (from $6,740 to $7,900)
for upperclassmen and by 32 percent
for freshmen, who are now paying
$8,900 a year.

a raider. taking advantage of a

‘‘I’m basically an optimist,“
said CMU Professor Gordon
Lewis. “Whenever l come into
Oakland. I always find parking-
...But then I only come into Oak-
land. twice a year."

continued from page one

All told, according to Freeman,
tuition for students in Pitt's Medical
School has increased 642 percent
between 1972 and the current ﬁscal
year.

In the last _l0 years. the state has
provided $7.465 per student in the
medical school. But when $7,465 is
converted into l97l dollars, it
represents a value of $3.544. “a

decrease in real state support of 53
percent," asid Freeman.

“So the state support ha-Sn’!
Freeman explained.

In order to avoid what Freeman
described as a “disaster in the area of
medical education today," Pitt is
requesting that the state raise per-
student support to $l5,2l2 this yer.
Then, in subsequent years. Pitt is
asking that the rate per student be
increased at the same percentage as
the total university appropriation.

To reconcile recent state concerns
of a possible glut of doctors in areas
where they are not needed and too
many out-of-state students in Pen-
nsylvania medical schools, Pitt and
the other state-related universities
wil propose a two-part strategy, also
aimed at getting increased state sup-
port for medical students.

The first part is a proposal, under
the Pennsylvania Higher Education
Assistance Agency (PHEAA) stu-
dent loan program, ofa special loan
program for medical students.
Loans under the program would be
repayable after graduation and
resideaey sad wattle! iﬁéliiéié‘ 5 far.
giveness clause for practice in medi-
cally under-served areas in
Pennsylvania.

The second part is a commitment
by the medical schools to limit out-
of-state enrollment to approxi-
mately l5 percent of each class. The
other 85 percent ofthe classes would
be reserved for Pennsylvania
students.

“So whate we're suggesting is that
if the state would give us a big
increase (in financial support) this
year, establish the loan program and
make it possible for us to operate a
quality medical school. then we
would consent to restricting the
number of out-of-state students,”
Freeman said.

Freeman estimated that approxi-
mately 70 percent of previous medi-
cal school classes have consisted of
Pennsylvania students.

Freeman criticized Gov. Richard
Thornburgh’s and other state legis-
lators’ argument against increasing
state funding for medical education
until the glut of physicians in con-
centrated urban areas is reduced.‘

“The problem with their philo-
sophy and- their policy is that it
encourages everything they’re trying
to discourage," he said.

Faced with debts of between
$30000 to $40.000 after graduation
due to a lack of state support, Free-
man said. medical students will
often opt to go into relatively high-
paying specialties. such as cardiol-
ogy or radiology. or practice in
wealthy areas of the state.

“Its pretty clear that a policy that
encourages the accumulation of
heavy indebtedness on the part of
graduate medical students discour-
ages those people from serving in
medically under-served areas ofthe
commonwealth." he said.

Freeman and other university

representatives will present the
appropriations request before offi-
cials ofthe state Department ofEdu-
cation next week.

Parents, Courts
and Decisions

The word “paternalism” is used in sociology and cultural
studies to denote laws that seem to rule in lieu of
parents—for example, illegal sexual acts. That general
term, however, has now taken on specific meaning;
courts can now decide the welfare of a child. Such a
judicial stance has rarely been questioned in cases of
obvious child abuse or molestation. The Chad Green
case, however-—and cases like it-—have sparked protests.

Chad Green was a 4-year-old cancer victim. His par-
ents felt that ordinary treatment was ineffective, so they
sought out alternate methods. The doctors treating Chad
asked for and received a court order to retain Chad, but
the parents ﬂed to Mexico seeking a laetrile cure and thus
escaped the order. Chad died after several weeks at a
Mexican clinic.

Dr. Sandford Edberg, Allegheny County coroner, has
now recommended to District Attorney Bob Colville that
a mother be brought up on charges stemming from a
death of her 14-year-old daughter. Reports given to
Edberg indicate that the girl, a cancer victim, was taken
to religious healers instead of the hospital and died with-
out ever receiving radiation or chemical treatments.

We live in a confusing age. The demarcation between A
law and privacy is now uncertain, and the assumption of
parental authority has become legal question.

If the district attorney does decide to file charges, his
office must proceed with maximum caution. All ques-
tions of law can become gray, but few have the moral
implications of this case. One way ofinterpreting the case
might sound something like this: “Trusting God with the
health of a child can be considered negligence.”

However, we cannot be ignorant. For too long child
abuse has flourished under the banner of parental
authority. Courts must intervene when the welfare ofthe

child is threatened by ignorance or inability of the
parents.

And the courts should intervene in this case as well.

. Cancer is a disease without logic. It strikes any age, but
it does so with a special ferocity in children. Yet, slowly,
work and research are winning the battle. For a parent to
distrust the medical profession is one thing, but to ensure
that the cancer will grow in the child’s body unchecked is
quite anbther—it’s criminal.

One final note, however: we rely on courts and law to _.
ﬁnd rational answers. Yet a I4-year-old girl with cancer is
not a rational occurrence. Is it possible to blame a moth-
er’s inexplicable actions in the face of this insane, con-
suming disease?

To be logical and fair, laws and legal system must not
rely on human emotion. But so little in life is fair, and
even less is logical.

Things That Go Bump In The Night

BY MARY KAN E
Editor

When the ceiling started to fall
down early Wednesday morning in
the Pitt News offices in the Schenley
Hall basement, we weren’t especially
concerned. Stranger things have
happened on deadline nights. And
when the water began to gush down,
we adjusted quickly, positioning
garbage cans beneath particular pla-

ces, stepping around puddles, mak-

ing jokes. Anything can be funny at
4 a.m.

What wasn’t so funny was the fact
that no one discovered the break in
the Schenley Hall water pipe until it
trickled down to the basement. A
crack in a pipe in the building's
upper floors, it was discovered the
morning after (there’s got to be a
morning after), had caused the
deluge. It flooded offices from the
sixth floor down. Thejudicial board
office on the main floor was com-
pletely flooded, and its records were
destroyed, which may come as wel-
come reliefnto some.

Water damage,however, isn’t the

actual problem here. Security is.

Campus police officers regularly
make rounds throughout Schenlev
Hall every evening. But university
engineers knew nothing about the
incident until someone from the Pitt
News basement‘office—the very last
office on the ladder of saturation—
called and told them.

This is not to suggest outright that
perhaps campus police officers had
been a teeny bit negligent; we realize
how easily gushing water can be
overlooked. But now that we're on
the subject...

Last week some typewriters and
dental equipment were stolen from
Salk Hall. When questioned, the
campus police response was that the
theft could have been the result of
“thousands of keys”that seem to be
floating about the university. How
reassuring. Keep in mind these same
police blamed earlier thefts in the
student union on negligence by stu-
dent organizations. They made these
claims despite the lack of evidence
that offices had been broken into.

You don't need the mind of Sher-
lock Holmes to guess that somebody
who has access to keys-—or, let's be
more direct, somebody who has

keys—is behind this. Instead of con-
jecturing the numbers and origins of
them, wouldn’t it be nice to actually
do something about them? Maybe
changing the thousands oflocks that
match the ﬂoating keys?

A story is floating around—what
a mobile university this is——about a
guy who passed himself offas a visit-
ing philosophy professor from
Notre Dame and told a secretary he
needed keys to the philosophy
department offices. He got them.
Procedures for checking a person's
identity here are amazing.

There is little else we can do
besides locking the doors to our uni-
versity offices. If that isn’t enough,
we can only ask that the campus
police do more than estimate. There
are too many incidents——ranging
from video games walking away
from the recreation room to a photo
enlarger the size of a Pittsburgh
Steeler linebacker mysteriously
leaving a Pitt News dark room, to
typewriters recently stolen from the
Kurtzmann Room——that lead us to
believe the problem comes from
within.

Campus theft is now becoming a
question of when and not if.

We Get Letters About Letters 

Dear Editor:

William Divens has asked me a
few questions in his letter protesting
my “misdirected” and “irrationally"
pro-labor letter. Here are the
answers to his questions.

0 No, I don‘t think that “my
union, right or wrong" is ajustiﬁable
slogan. My letter was explicitly criti-
cal of present-day unions for their
insufficient awareness of the need
for solidarity among working people
and their lack of a broad commit-
ment to social justice.

. Yes, l’ve studied statistics
regarding air traffic controllers.
Here are some worth considering: In
the last four years only I52 air traffic
controllers have been able to make it
to retirement. Significantly, I267
have been disabled for physical and
emotional problems related to
stress. More than 89% of all con-
trollers terminate employment due
toihealth problems. Also worth con-
sidering is this comment made last
October by Ronald Reagan: "l have
been thoroughly_ briefed by
members of my staff as to the

deplorable state of our nation‘s air
traffic control system. They have
told me that too few people working
unreasonably long hours with obso-
lete equipment has placed the
nation’s air travellers in unwar-
ranted danger.” Maybe the Presi-
dent and Mr. Divens should
reconsider their present hostility
toward the air traffic controllers’
union.

0 No, I don’t consider “any con-
tract legally binding.” If someone
signs a contract selling himself or
herself into slavery, or otherwise
abrogating their democratic rights
(e.g., freedom of expression, free-
dom of association, the right to
strike, etc.), I don’t think that con-
tract should be legally binding. No
employer, including the govern-
ment, should have the right to make
such restrictions a condition of
employment. Workers have violated

the law by exercising their right to
strike in Poland. 1 support them. I
don’t have a double standard for
American workers.

0 Yes, we do need more teachers.
There is'a much-publicized and well-
documented decline in the quality of
American education. (Is Mr. Divens
really unaware ofthis?) I believe that
one way to reverse this is to reduce
class sizes. I think we need, there-
fore, more and better—trained
teachers. Mr. Divens objects: “That
sort of thinking would have been
responsible for an increase in the
number of blacksmiths when the
automobile was becoming popular.”
Does he mean that we should lay off
teachers because deteriorating edu-
cation is “becoming popular?” I
hope not!

Pitt-Cincinnati G

By JOHNETTE HOWARD
Sports Editor .

For the Pitt Panther footbal
team, Saturday‘s contest with the
Cincinnati Bearcats could be com-
pared to a drum roll——it keeps you
waiting for the main attraction.

The “main attraction” is the
stretch of the Pitt schedule that kicks
off next month with the team’s first
stiff test, against South Carolina
Oct. 3. Tomorrow’s game with Cin-
cinnati (0-2), sandwjched between
two 14-day layoffs tor tne nu team,
is a small respite from practice for
the 7th-ranked Panthers.

For now, the Panthers must be

satisfied with Cincinnati, a team that

harbors little hope of beating the
Panthers. Like a trip to the dentist,
the Bearcats just want to get Satur-
day’s appointment with Pitt over
with.

“After looking at. the ﬁlms, we'll
just try to stay alive,” said Cincinnati
coach Mike Gottfried, whose team is
still smarting from last week's 52-0
lashing by Penn State, “l’ve run out
of adjectives and everything else to
describe these last two teams.”

At least Gottfried is candid when
he describes his own team.

“We’re down right now,” he said.
“But there was a good program here
when l was an assistant in '75 and
76. I think it can be a good program
again. But we have a lot of improv-
ing to do.”

Leading the Bearcats into tomor-
row’s game is James Bettis, a 5-9,
l70—pound senior and 1,000-yard
rusher who accounted for 105 of
Cincinnati’s l 13 yards against Penn
State last week.

Aided by a huge offensive line,
anchored by 6-6, 269 pound All-
America candidate Kari Yil-Renko,
Bettis and the Cincinnati running
attack were the major bright spots
for the Bearcats last week.

ame: Tale

After c ming off the bench for a fine game against
Illinois, Pitt flanker Barry Compton should figure prominently

again Saturday.

“They ran the ball well at times
(against Penn State),” Pitt coach
Jackie Sherrill said. “Their offensive
line is very large. They try to over-
split and hit the cracks with Bettis.”
At quarterback, the Bearcats have
four candidates vying for the start-
ing spot. Freshman Shawn Morton,
a 6-1, 1'80-pound Bethel Park pro-'
duct, played most of last week’s
game after relieving starter James

Gottfried said he probably won’t

tomorrow until he walks onto‘the
field before the game. All four quar-
terbacks have seen action so far this

Despite a rather sloppy field and
an aggressive opponent, the Panther
soccer team managed to bring home
its third straight victory as it beat St.
Vincent College Wednesday 3—l.

Junior Eric Tiedtke scored two
goals, giving him a total offive goals
for the season, and freshman Jim
Steele added his first collegiate goal.

Steele’s score came in the first
half, with sophomore Gerry Wasson
picking up the assist. At the half, Pitt
maintained its 1-0 lead.

In the second half, the Pitt squad
was forced to defend the sloppy and
soggy part of the rain-soaked field,
and the Pitt backs had a hard time
keeping their footing.

“St. Vincent was working the ball
in and out of the midfield and had
the momentum,” said Coach Leo
Bemis.

St. Vincent finally got on the
board with a shot from I5 yards out
that Panther goalie, Scott Thum-
berg had no chance of saving. The
goal tied the score l-l.

After the goal, St. Vincent con-
tinued their very physical game, and
the Pitt midfield had a tough time
controlling the ball. Pitt came back
when Tiedtke scored his first goal of
the game on a feed from freshman
Gary Gaido.

After the score, a-St. Vincent
player kicked Tiedtke in the back of
the_legs. Pitt team captain Al Adel-

and shoved the St. Vincent player.
Adelmann was spotted by the refe-
ree and given a red card for
unsportsmanlike conduct, and
Adelmann had to leave the game.

Playing with only I0 men, Bemis
had to make some changes. Tiedtke
was switched to the center, a change
which proved beneficial for the
Panthers.

Tiedtke took possession of the
ball and dribbled down the right side
of the field to the base line. The St.
Vincent defenders expected Tiedtke
to pull back, but he fooled them—

The Pit

The Pitt offensive line will have to turn back the Bearcats’ strong rush to give Dan Marino

time to hit his receivers

zvntinuedfroni page gig/1;

still very young," Gottfried said.

The Bearcat coach commended
another local product, Mount
Lebanon’s Phil Peckich, for his
strong punting performance in the
first two games. Peckich has aver-
aged 48 yards a kick so far this year.
Last week the punting squad held
Penn State to zero net yards in punt
returns.

Defensively, the new wide tackle
six system Gottfried installed upon
arriving at Cincinnati has, so far,
worked more like a sieve than a’

‘,":t«etone wall. In apparent stop gap

measure, Gottfried says he’ll make
some adjustments for the Pitt game.

“Our safety, (Antonio) Gibson, is
our leading tackler. He’s getting
killed right now. lt’s like Greyhound
buses coming through the line,"
Gottfried said. “We have to change a
few things.”

When asked how his pass defense,
a supposedly vulnerable facet ofthe
wide tackle six, has been perform-
ing, Gottfried said, “I don’t know.
We haven’t really been tested yet.

Everyone’s run right through us.”

Tomorrow, the Bearcat
defense should get a rigid test.
Expect Panthers to throw early and
often against the Bearcats to mit-
igate the potential rush the wide-six
system generates.

w e have to throw the ball and hit
the big plays early to get them out of
that pass rush,” said Pitt offensive
coordinator Joe Moore said yester-
day. Seemingly all that separates the
Panther offense and quarterback
Dan Marino from a big day passing,
if they handle the rush, is the ability
of the Panther wideouts to beat the
Bearcats’ one-on-one pass coverage.
If they do, the scoreboard could
click all day.

Though Sherrill is not concerned
about his players’ ability to motivate
themselves for tomorrow’s game, he
did indicate the team's motivation in
practice could improve.

“We’re not the same football team
we were last year. lt’s very difficult
for our players to get up for every
practice. That comes from matur-
ity,” Sherrill said. “Last year, when
Hugh Green came on to the practice

pass,

field, it was electrified. Our offense
came out and hit. We're not at that
stage yet."

How do you reach that stage?

“Maturity. We need to improve
every day in practice,” Sherrill said.
‘‘I’m concerned how our football
team will react to adversity.”

Chances are the team won't have
to Saturday.

PITT NOTES: Several Pitt players
are definitely out of tomorrow’s
game. They are Dwight Collins
(pulled hamstring); Darrell Clark
(cut hand); John Hendrick and Greg
Christy (knee injuries), and Al
Wenglikowski (sprained ankle).
Other injured players who should
see action are Mike Dorundo (neck
strain); Joe McCall (groin pull);
Tom Flynn (strained quadricep)...
Linebacker Sal ‘S~unseri has had a
virus, but he should also play...
Drop end Chris Doleman, who
replaces Wenglikowski on the left
side, is the only freshman to start for
Pitt besides offensive tackle Bill
Fralic.

Top 10 Predictions:
ND-Michigan Match
Key Game on Tap

By AMIN GHOSSEIN
Assistant Sports Editor

Some interesting games in the
college ranks this week:

Pitt over Cincinnati: This will
be no contest. The Bearcats are
more of a Division ll football
team than I-A.

The final score won’t be 52-O
like last week in Penn State,
simply because the Nittany Lions
are presently a better football
team than the Panthers. It will be
convincing, however: Pitt 38,
Cincinnati 0.

Michigan over Notre Dame:
Tough game to figure out. The
Irish’ looked strong in demolish-
ing LSU, while the Wolverines
looked horrendous in losing to
Wisconsin.

After a plethora of preseason
publicity that said Michigan
would be the No. l team in the
nation, the Wolverines fell ﬂat
on their face. Thus is a big game
for Schembechler because it's on
national TV; an impressive win
could vault Michigan back into
the Top 10 picture.

The Wolverines can still be a
factor in the national champion-
ship because they still get to go
the Rose Bowl ifthey win the Big
Ten. A must win: Michigan 17,
Notre Dame 10.

Nebraska over Florida State:
Poor Bobby Bowden. His sche-
dule is murderous, starting this
week with Nebraska on the road.
Another problem is that his Sem-

inoles just aren't that good.

The Cornhuskers will be mad
after being upset by Iowa:
Nebraska 24, Florida State 10.

Georgia over Clemson: Her-
schel Walker takes the ball, Her-
schel Walker runs with the ball,
Herschel Walker runs over
Clemson: Georgia 26, Clemson
14.

USC over Indiana: The Tro-
jans may be looking ahead to
next week when they face the
Sooners of Oklahoma. They
won’t look too hard, however:
USC 35, Indiana 10.

Texas over North Texas State:
Hmmm, not much here: Texas
45, North Texas State 14.

Ohio State over Michigan
State: No problem here for Earl
Bruce. His Buckeyes looked
impressive in beating Duke last
week. Art Schlichter threw the
ball extremely well, and that is
trouble for Buckeye opponents:
Ohio State 38, Michigan State
l7.

UCLA over Wisconsin: Wis-
consin is coming off a big, big,
upset of previously rated No. l
Michigan. Are the Badgers for
real? The feeling is that they're
not: UCLA 24, Wisconsin l0.

North Carolina over Miami
(Ohio): North Carolina has had a
quietly effective program for
three years now, and they will
show their prowess again this
week: North Carolina 28, Miami
7.

He‘:

Suffer Setback

By MARIE HUFF
Pitt News Sportswriter

The Lady Pitt Panthers lost their
second tennis match of the season
Wednesday afternoon, falling victim
to Duquesne 6-3. The loss dropped
their record to 0-2. However, ever-
optimistic Coach George Dieffen-
bach was anything but heartbroken.

“We were losing, but I couldn't
help smiling as l watched them play.
Our timing is getting better every-
day, as are our shots,” said Dieffen-
bach. “l’m sure it’s just a matter of
time before we get our first win."

In the Duquesne match, Randi
Belkin and Cathy Jacobson were the
only Lady Panthers to procure wins.
Belkin defeated sophomore Jeannie
Lazzarro 6-2, 6-2, whil'e Jacobson
quickly disposed of Vivian Pansirio
6-l, 6-0. The two then paired for a
doubles win over Vivian Pansino
and Barb Guesenhues 6-3, 6-1. How-
ever, that was the end ofthe winning
ways for the Lady Panthers.

Junior Jean Thompson bested

Pitt's freshman Miriam Goltz 6-2,
6-3. Duquesne’s Barb Guesenhues
defeated sophomore Jody Mattioli
6-l, 6-3. Jean Ryan continued Duq-

uesene‘s resurgence, takinga 6-l , 6-3
win from Jan Kastory in the No.5
position matchup. Senior Yvonne
Lapinski put Duquesne ahead 4-2 in
the match with her 6-2, 6-3 victory
over junior Beth Baughman.

Aside from the Belkin-Jacobson
win,‘ it was all Duquesne in the dou-
bles play. Jean Bizzaro teamed with
Thompson to hand the Goltz-
Mattioli duo a 6-4, 6-3 loss.
Duquesne’s twosome of Ryan and

Lapinski wrapped up the match with

a 6-0, 6-3 win over Kastory and
Baughman.

According to Coach Dieffenbach,
the depth ofthe squad is still a ques-
tion mark. Aldene Lacaria's eligibil-
ity is being reviewed by the
Association for intercollegiate
Athletics for Women in Washing-
ton. D.C. She could be declared elig-
ible by Sunday’s Bucknell match,
which would alleviate some of Dief-
fenbach’s problems.

Lisa Weinberg has officially left
the team for academic reasons. A
senior about to enter dental school,
Weinberg was pressured for time
and opted to drop tennis from her
busy schedule.

Cathy Jacobson

The final name missing from Dief-
fenbach’s list of personnel is Lisa
LaFuria. LaFuria, a steady player
for Pitt for the last three years, is out
with mononucleosis. She is expected
to be out of action until mid or late
October. .

The Lady Panthers will host
Bucknell in their home opener on
Sunday afternoon at 2 p.m. at Trees
Courts.

CFA May Delay

By JOHNETTE HOWARD
Sports Editor

After postponing final ratification
of its NBC television contract for
one week, the Collegiate Football
Association is expected to announce
today that its showdown with the
NCAA can wait a few more months.

The NCAA Council voted last

Tuesday to call a special convention
Dec. 3-4 to consider restructuring its
top football division, Division I-A. a
key CFA demand in its conflict with
the NCAA over the issue of “prop-
erty rights.”
The CFA maintains it has a right to
negotiate its own television pact for
its 6l member schools. while the
NCAA contends it has the sole right
to obtain television contracts for all
members’ football games,which
would include the CFA’s.

Scoffing at the threat of possible
expulsion or suspension from the
NCAA, the CFA announced late
this summer that it had negotiated
its own four-year, $l8O million foot-
ball contract with NBC. The CFA

deal runs in direct conflict with the
NCAA recently negotiated $263 mil-
lion contract with ABC and CBS.
Both contracts run from 1982-85.

Just last week, a Texas judge in
Austin issued a temporary injunc-
tion prohibiting the NCAA from
threating or implementing action
against any member school that
went with the CFA.

In addition to the battle over

“property rights,” a term that has
come to mean the privilege of
awarding a school”s television and
cable TV rights, the CFA is seeking
restructuring of Division l—A to
eliminate what it calls “unfair voting
control” by the NCAA’s smaller
colleges.

The current NCAA one-school,
one-vote system puts the majority of
football nobodies like the University
of Chicago on the same footing as
CFA member football powers like
Notre Dame, Pitt and Penn State
when voting on football legislation
and TV contracts.

The CFA wants that system?

changed, and last week’s NCAA
Council decision to hold a special
convention on restructuring was
regarded by many schools as a con-
cession to CFA demands. By calling
the convention, the NCAA probably
has convinced the CFA to wait until
December before making a final

decision on its NBC contract,
according to two Pitt athletic
officials.

“I think the CFA will announce
either today or sometime this wee-
kend that it has decided to wait until
the convention in December," said
Dean Billick, Pitt associate director

of athletics for public affairs. “If

things are not worked out to the
CFA’s satisfaction then. you may
see its members decide to split with
the NCAA at that time. The CFA
schools have said all along that they
want to remain in the NCAA, but
they wouldn’t hesitate to jump if
they don’t get what they want."

“Nothing much has changed,
said Pitt Athletic Director Cas Mys-
linski Wednesday. “The CFA is con-
tinuing to consider all its options.”

Apparently Armageddon will
have to wait.

Pitt Booters

Win 3rd vs.
St. Vincent

continued from page eight

and slipped in his second goal ofthe
day.

The goal nearly deadened any St.
Vincent hope that might have
remained.

The only other St. Vincent threat
to raise the score came after a St.
Vincent player tripped Pitt junior
Karl Heimbach from behind and
was charged with a foul. The foul
nullified the goal St. Vincent had
scored on the play. Heimbach was
taken out of the game with a thigh
bruise.

Coach Bemis had mixed emotions
about the game.

“lt was a pretty good game,"said
Bemis. “But we didn’t play as well as
we could have. The important thing
is that we won and got another
player in the scoring (Steele)."

The Panther winning streak will
be challenged when they host
Slippery Rock State College at 7:l5
tonight at Pitt Stadium.

Slippery Rock beat Grove City 4-
2 Tuesday. According to Bemis,
tonight’s game will be a tough one.

“Slippery Rock is more explosive
this year than expected,” he said.
They seem to have the-ability to
score. They have the league‘s top
scorer last year, and he can put the
ball in the net.”

Pitt will have to look to its power-
ful defense to keep Slippery Rock
from scoring, relying on the consis-
tent play of defensivemen Heimb-
ach, Dan Bowen, Jim Hackworth
and Tom Trempus.

“For now we're going to have to
rely on our strong defensive game
scorers," Bemis said. “We’re going
to have to work on control and bet-
ter passing. We're going to have to
get a few more long shots into the

net."
Bemis added however, that ifthe

Panthers “keep working as a team,
we should keep on winning.”

Hoops opener
switched...

The Pitt men’s basketball teams
opener against Cincinnati has been
changed. Pitt will play Davis and
Elkins instead.

Cincinnati, it seems, has switched
athletic directors, and since there is
no written agreement obligating
Cincinnati, the Bearcats didn‘t want
to play the Panthers at Fitzgerald
Field House.

*****

Bouncing back...

Assistant basketball coach Reggie
Warford said yesterday that George
Allen, one of Pitt's top recruits this
year, may be able to join the team
earlier than was anticipated.

Allen, a 13-foot guard from New
York City, never graduated from
high school and was therefore short
on credits, preventing him from
enrolling at Pitt this term.

lt was originally feared that Allen
would miss close to nine games,but
Warford said that the Pitt coaching
staff is optimistic that Allen may
miss as few as five games.
