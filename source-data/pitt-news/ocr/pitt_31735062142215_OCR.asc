isumably still under construction, in a renewal of the drive

which brought in $15,000 in four  

months early this year.

The battleship drive was con- 0:

ceived by Herbert Gall, M43, now

with the Army Air Corps in Texas.. I 0

early in January. During the next
month, the drive was initiated, and
each succeeding Wednesday found
new records set only to be smashed

the next week. Highlight of the.

campaign came on April 15, desig-

nated at General MacArthur Day,‘

when over $3,200 in stamps and
bonds were sold.

Again the Iowa will be set up in
the ground floor elevator lobby
each Wednesday from 9 :30 o’clock
until 3:30 o’clock for the sale of
stamps and bonds. Thomas
Moore, C45, and Hugh Chavern,
C45, are co-chairmen of the new
battleship drive.

Sales will continue for six Weeks,
after which Student Faculty asso-
ciation’s Bond Sales committee will
take over for the Fall and Winter
semesters. During the summer, all
administrative and sales duties will
be handled by members of Druids.

This drive marks the Druids’
ﬁrst wartime activity, and also
sets off this organization as the
ﬁrst honorary group on campus to
transform their activity schedule
into an all-out, directed, and total
war effort, according to Chavern.

Stamp and bond sales are only
one phase of the Druid wartime
program under the Druid Victory
committees. Irving Leiber, BA44,
is coordinator of the several Vic-
tory committees.

Larry McBride, C45, heads the
Druid-University Defense Council
committee, and Dave Oppenheim,
C45, is chairman of the Blood Bank
committee. Ken Alexander, E45, is
at the head of the Letter Writing
committee.

The purpose of the latter is to
locate and to write to Druid alumni
now in the services.

All of the 19 active members
of Druids as well as a number of
inactive brothers among the up-
per classmen will assist Dr. John
W. Oliver, professor and head of
history department, in his War
Information Center work which
will begin in early September.

Aiding in an advisory capacity
are Dr. John M. Ferguson, assist-
ant professor of economics. and
Lieutenant Howard 0. Husband of
the Military Science department.

CwItoBeginSaIes

Opening its activity for the ﬁrst
time on a tri—semester basis, the
Owl, undergraduate yearbook, this
week starts its sales campaign and
picture appointment scheduling for
those seniors who will be graduat-
ed at the end of the summer sem-
ester.

For those seniors who are here
on deferments from military ser-
vice or those who expect to be
called up soon, the Owl has made
arrangements for their pictures
to be taken during the appoint-
ment period from August 11 to
August 22 inclusive.

Picture appointments for 'sit-
tings at Photo-Reﬂex studios may
be made for any day during the
two week sales campaign. Don
Lingenfelter, BA43, will be in the
Owl office, 803 Cathedral, from 1
until 2:30 o’clock daily to schedule
the senior’s picture sittings.

“Freedom” will be the theme.
of the 1943 Owl, Ed Rose, pub-
licity manager, states. To carry
out this theme the Owl will fea-
ture all war activities at Pitt,
such as the ROTC, morale pro-
grams, defense classes, in the
tri—semester yearbook.

Unknown to students the Owl
hasalready amassed a sizeable li-
brary of photographs taken du

tinue to take them during the six
week semester now begun.

As in the past the Owl will be a
picture book. All campus events
will receive full photographic cov-
erage as well as a detailed writeup.
Freshmen, sophomores, juniors and
seniors alike will be given space
in the annual.

The Pitt yearbook will probably
be the only college annual to have
a tri—semester makeup, the editors
believe.

Deep In The Heart of Truth

, _ Last month at the University of Texas, four economics
professors who opposed Senator Lee “Pappy” O’Daniel’s some-
what stupid views on the forty-hour week were dismissed
from that institution. The professors objected to much of the
propaganda being leveled against the forty—hour week, said

so, a.nd were ﬁred.

Important to the University of Pittsburgh is the com-
ment on the affair made in the liberal, opinionated newsmag-
azine, New Republic. Says New Republic, . . . “The University
of Texas must now be added to that list which includes the

’ University of Pittsburgh and several unhappy others, where

no good man will teach if he can possibly ﬁnd a job somewhere
else, where the standards fall lower and lower while the citi-

zens hang their heads . . .”

We feel that we don’t know enough about the background .
of faculty administration relations at the University to refute
New Republic’s condemnation. But we feel that students of
the University must be given all the available facts, and then
allowed to make their own decision.

To this end a letter, asking New Republic for what evi-
dence’ it has, has already been sent out. When we get it, you
will,know what we ﬁnd out. This wepromise. _

Meanwhile we ask all those whom we have heard talking
about the article to suspend judgment until such time as more
of the facts have been made clear one way or another. Believe
us when we say this is in‘no way an attempt to quash or

. smooth over the incident. The condemnation of the University

by a nationally known magazine is a serious matter-—rotte4.i if
the implications are false, worse if they’re true.

Justus Mulert Memorial

  Room to e Dedicated Soon

Now in the act of construction is
a memorial room to be dedicated in
the honor of the Justus Mulert
family.‘

The Justus Mulert Memorial
room, which is situated on the
second ﬂoor above the Chancel-
lor’s office will be, when com-
pleted, in true classical style with
a predominant inﬂuence of Greek
architecture.

Expressive use o'f walnut will give
the room a different appearance
from that of the Greek room on the
ﬁrst ﬂoor. The walls will be of wal-
nut, extending to the sides of a
segmental arch ceiling.

Ten walnut columns will sur-
round the room, and the ﬂoor will
be lined with two-tone walnut
blocks. A walnut bench before a

’ large bay window will ‘add to the

classical theme while the indirect
concealed lighting and concealed

radiators will afford it the most

modern of the recent innovations.

That it will not lose all aspects

of a classroom, the Mulert room

will have large blackboards, and
-a table with chairs of walnut.

Finally, on the back wall of the

. room, there will be erected a plaque

in the memory of Justus Mulert

"and his family.

Must Russia Fight

statement: “It can be said that
the.coming operations will divert
German strength from the at-
tack on Russia.”
Once more, perhaps wrongly, the
people concluded that this meant
the opening of a second front, for

" it was impossible to believe that

such things as the bombing of in-
dustrial targets in the Ruhr could
force Hitler to divert German
strength in any effective amount
from Russia.

And yet, today we are told, in
spite of all these statements, on
high British authority, that we
do not have the ships, that we do
not have the planes, the tanks,
the guns, or the men to launch a
drive on a second front.

' Justus Mulert, who resided in
Pittsburgh for many years and
who was an insurance man of
high reputation, bequeathed in
his will that a certain amount
of his estate should be turned
over to the University for the
construction of a classroom in
memory ofhhis family and him-
self.

The classical languages, espe-
cially Latin and Greek, were Jus-
tus Mulert’s favorite studies. The
inﬂuence of the classics on hislife
has its expression in his memorial
room.

Justus Mulert leaves behind
him two sons and a daughter.
Carl J. and Justus L., who at-
tended the University in 1922 and
1926 respectively, and were both
students of John Weber, Univer-
sity secretary. Both sons are now
prominent insurance men.

Sometime in the future the room
will be formally presented to the
University. Executors of the Mu-
l'ert~ estate W-ill take part. —

Business in the Pittsburgh dis-
trict edged a little higher accord-
ing to the Bureau of Business Re-
search. The seasonally adjusted in-
dex standing at 152.1 percent of
the 1923-25 average was the high-
est since the week ended July 4.

Pittsburgh Sales

Show increase

Industrial production, reports
the bureau, remained about un-
changed for the fourth consecutive
week. Steel mill activity declining
a little, the industry in Pittsburgh
last week was operating at about
96 percent of capacity. Originating
shipments were higher, increases
being reported in both rail and riv-
er traffic. ’

Owing partly to the lag in de-
partment store sales and partly to
a counter—seasonal drop in bank
debits, the volume of trade declin-
ed slightly. Sales of Pittsburgh de-
partment stores in the four weeks
ended August 1 were 9 percent be-
low those in the comparable four
weeks last year. Yet total sales in

‘the ﬁrst 31 weeks of 1942 were 9
per cent greater than those in the
same period of 1941.

[Nice To Be Back '$ay New
Ass ’t. Deans Foster, Springer

By ELAINE KAHN V
The Dean of Women’s Office staff

was multiplied to four with ‘the ap-
pointment of,Betty Springer, C41,
to the Information Office and Eliza-
beth Foster, C42, to Heinz Chapel
as, for the ﬁrst time, these oﬂices
were brought under the supervision
of the Dean of Women’s Office.

Dean Rush described the move as
being designed to. “relate these po-
sitions to a department organized
to do personnel work.” The new as-
sistants will, in addition to the du-
ties of their positions, assist Dean
Rush n teaching the orientation
classes and in carrying out the vari-
ous phases of the program for
women at Pitt.

Both Miss Springer and Miss Fos-
ter tend to agree on the fact that
“it is nice to be back in school
again.” Betty Springer is ﬁnding
her sociology major and psychology
minor very helpful in handling the
persons and questions that make

up life behind the Information desk.
“The nicest thing about my work-
ing here,” sh-e conﬁdes, “is that

Phi Gam, Sigma Chi, Lead

i-F   Mushball

Those fraternity boys started to
bat the mushball around last Wed-
nesday; and after two nights’ com-
petition, the strong Phi Gam and
Sigma Chi outﬁt, “mystery ball
team,” led the seven team league
with a record of one win against
no losses.

Urban Beas pitched the Sigma
Chi’sto their victory against the
Pi Lams. He limited his oppon-
ents to four hits; and his team-
mates took advantage of Marty
Faberman’s bad shoulder to
knock out ten hits, starting things
off‘ right with two runs in the
ﬁrst inning.

The Phi Gam-Sigma Alpha Mu
game was What all good sports-
writers call a “pitchers’ duel.” Joe

Race

Robinson, for the Phi Gams, ration-
ed out only ﬁve wel1—scattered hits,
and “Red” Silverman covered
practically every spot on the Sig-
ma Alpha Mu inﬁeld, besides pitch-
ing a six-hit game and striking out
thirteen of his opponents. The lone
run in the seventh inning’ came in
the ﬁfth, when the Fijis forced in
a run with a scratch single through
second.

Thursday night saw the Pi Lams
come back to wallop Sigma Al-
pha Mu, 10-0. Faberman had his
fast ball zooming in at the plate,
and was never in trouble. “Red”
Silverman pitched another out-
standing game for the second
straight night, but poor support
from his teammates put him in
one tough spot after another.

comes into the University, and that
includes all the celebrities, such as
the Norwegian Fliers who stopped
here while in Pittsburgh and the
vari-ous Nationality groups.” The
chief problem she has encountered
in her new position is how to tact-
fully answer people who ask ques-
tions like “What floor is the So]-
diers and Sailors Memo-rial on?”
and “Surely this is not all of the
University. Isn’t part of it an office
building?”

Miss Springer is a native of
Leetsdale, Pennsylvania, where she
attended Leetsdale High School.
While at Pitt she was a member of
Senior Court, Mortar Board, Cwens,
the Owl'Staff, and Kappa Kappa
Gamma.

Explaining the beauties of the
Heinz chapel stained glass windows
and art work seems the ideal posi-
tion for May graduate Elizabeth
Foster who majored in Fine Arts.
“It all ties in beautifully with my
studies while at the University,”
states Miss Foster who likes her
new work very much. She admits
she greatly enjoys explaining the
windows to the hundred or more
visitors who daily visit the Chapel,
but, she adds, “I stand in respect-
ful silence before the many experts
who come to look upon the famed
windows.”

A sister Kappa to Betty Springer,
Miss Foster is a graduate of the
Miss Ellis School. At Pitt she was
Chief Justice of the Senior Court,
a Senior Mentor and a member of
Cwens. '

Incidentally, the job of teaching
orientation to freshmen women
will not be a new one to either of
the new assistants, both of whom
having ﬁlled in for the regular in-
structors duri,ng their senior year.

WAAC Selects
Six Pitt pwomen
For Training

Women are not going to be the
“girls you leave behind” in this wars
Tired of knitting and writing let-
ters to service men, some American
women are enlisting for regular
army training in the Women’s
Army Auxiliary Corps.

Again Pitt women are taking an
active part. Out of the 24 women

trict, 6 are Pitt women. They are:
Betty Brunk, ’41; Mary Cole, mas-
ter in letters 1940; Kathleen Rita
Donnelly, ex ’43; Marian McKay,
master in letters, 1941; Jane Mus-
ser, ’42, and Kathleen Neely, baah-;
elor of laws, 1940.

These women have all been ac-
cepted for Officers’ Training and
have all been instructed to report
to Fort Des Moines. Misses Neely
and McKay are due in Des Moines
on August 17; the rest do not have
to report until the 24th.

Jane ‘Musser who is just 21,
the minimum age accepted by the
women’s corp, is the youngest
selected from this district for
that training. She was president
of Alpha Delta Pi, social frater-
nity at the University, last year. '

The girls’ training will last for
three months, their job—--for the
duration. ‘

Enlisted Reserves
inducts 17 Men,
Third Pitt Group

Seventeen new army enlisted re-~
serve members were sworn in last.
Wednesday afternoon by Colonel
Edward Kelly, professor of military
science and tactics. This was the
third group of army reserve mem-
bers that have been accepted from ,,
the University. To date seventy.-‘
one members have been accepted.’ '

No applications for the army
enlisted reserve will be accepted
during August. According to
Colonel Kelly, students will again
have the opportunity to apply for
admission to the army enlisted
reserves some time during Sep-
tember or October.

The following is a list of the Pitt
students who were accepted last
Week:

Robert H. Cook, Paul K. Kuzma,

In order to ﬁt the ‘University air
raid protection service more com-

pletely into the plans of the Alle-

gheny County Council of Civilian
Defense, the University has organ-
ized a regular air raid warden
{training course for the beneﬁt of
its own personnel.

The new class, which is made
~ up of seventy-three faculty, ad-
:ministrative and secrtarial per-
~ sonnel, is a cross section of the

University. According to Dr.
John J. Geise, associate professor

“If school systems paid teachers
‘attractive salaries ‘such as those

paid by industries and defense or-

ganizations, the shortage of teach-
ers would not be as critical as it

. s,” said Dr. George Gould, profes-
-Bor of education and director of the

tudent placement bureau.

There is an acute shortage of
teachers in the ﬁelds of chemis-
try, physics, industrial arts and
vocational education. This de-
wﬁciency is caused by men going
, into industries and defense plants
and there are not many trained
women to replace them, he said.

M It has been a tradition thot wom-
en do not go into the teaching ﬁelds
r the -physical sciences or indus-

of history and chief air raid war-
den of the Cathedral, practically
every department in each school
is represented in the ‘new class.
_When the seventy-three class
members have ﬁnished their course.
they will be added to the air raid
protection service of the Univer-
sity. The University will then have
a completely staffed organization
that is authorized and qualiﬁed to
operate anywhere.

trial and vocational Work. To meet
this situation, it is expected that
more women will venture into these
ﬁelds, added Dr.‘ Gould.

On the other hand, Dr. Gould
said that there is a demand for ele-
mentary teachers and that the ma-
jority of students in the February
and April classes who wanted to
teach have been placed.

New York City’s Schools

Dr. Lee N. Thurston, professor
of. Education at the University has
been appointed to a committee

.which will make a survey of the

ﬁnance and organization of NeW_
York City schools.

The New York Joint Legislative
Committee to Investigate the Pub-
lic Education System is headed by
Dr. George D. Strayer of Columbia
University and is composed of ex-

perts from various parts of the-

country.

Dr. Thurston, chosen as one
of the ﬁrst authorities on school
ﬁnance, has been given a leave
of absence by the University to
‘aid in the survey.

A native of Michigan, he was
graduated from the state univer-
sity there and also received 
and Ph.D. degrees at that‘ school.

A former Unitedpstates marine,

_he saw foreign service for eighteen
months during the World War. He

_held many teaching posts in his

home state including that of Deputy
